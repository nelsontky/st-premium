    <p>A Bri­ton who had taught in Sin­ga­pore for about 30 years was sen­tenced to nine months’ jail yes­ter­day af­ter he pleaded guilty to con­sum­ing drugs.</p>
    <p>Christophe­r David Burge com­mit­ted the crimes in Septem­ber 2018. He was em­ployed at Hwa Chong In­sti­tu­tion (HCI).</p>
    <p>His lawyers told the court that Burge was suf­fer­ing from psy­chi­atric dis­or­ders at the time, brought about by his fa­ther’s death in a car ac­ci­dent caused by Burge. They said Burge be­lieved he had fallen asleep at the wheel.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bu­reau, act­ing on a tipoff, found drugs in Burge’s home in</p>
    <p>Linden Drive near Eng Neo Av­enue on Sept 20, 2018. He was ar­rested.</p>
    <p>He ad­mit­ted to hav­ing taken metham­phetamine, or Ice, at his home that morn­ing, and on Sept 13 and 16, 2018. In the course of in­ves­ti­ga­tions, Burge said he con­sumed the drug be­cause he en­joyed it, and would have con­tin­ued con­sum­ing it if he had not been ar­rested.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the de­fence ar­gued that Burge was act­ing out of char­ac­ter then as he was suf­fer­ing from psy­chi­atric dis­or­ders af­ter the ac­ci­dent in Bri­tain in De­cem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Burge had been charged in Bri­tain for the head-on col­li­sion which led to his 95-year-old fa­ther’s death.</p>
    <p>The de­fence ar­gued for a pro­ba­tion re­port to be made or, if Burge is found un­suit­able for it, for a lighter sen­tence in the light of the “spe­cial cir­cum­stances”.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Rebecca Wong ar­gued for a 14-month jail sen­tence, not­ing doc­tors’ as­sess­ments that Burge knew what he was do­ing at the time and “knew that drug of­fences were both morally and legally wrong”.</p>
    <p>The de­fence said that since his ar­rest, Burge has been seek­ing pro­fes­sional help and been given sup­port by his for­mer stu­dents at HCI, some of whom also at­tested to his good char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing, District Judge Ong Luan Tze told Burge that drug of­fences are taken very se­ri­ously in Sin­ga­pore and only in ex­cep­tional cases can “de­ter­rence be dis­placed by pro­ba­tion”. While she ac­cepted the men­tal dis­or­ders present at the time and noted that there may have been a causal link, she was “not con­vinced” that de­ter­rence should be dis­placed since Burge knew the of­fences were wrong and still com­mit­ted them.</p>
    <p>Burge will be ap­peal­ing against the sen­tence.</p>
    <p>An HCI spokesman said Burge has been sus­pended since Septem­ber 2018 and the school is “very dis­ap­pointed with his trans­gres­sions”.</p>
