    <p>Four art­fully lit pedestals in the ArtS­cience Mu­seum’s new ex­hi­bi­tion hold cu­rated ob­jects.</p>
    <p>In­stead of art­works, how­ever, the dis­plays of­fer up a pile of flip-flops and small buck­ets of straws, among other things.</p>
    <p>The items are just some of the plas­tic trash picked up along Sin­ga­pore’s shores in one day by lo­cal en­vi­ron­men­tal group Seven Clean Seas. They demon­strate vividly the pol­lu­tion caused by plas­tics which Planet Or Plas­tic? aims to high­light.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion, a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the mu­seum and Na­tional Geo­graphic, is ArtS­cience’s first show since re­open­ing its doors.</p>
    <p>The idea for an ex­hi­bi­tion about the im­pact of plas­tic on the planet had been per­co­lat­ing since 2018 when Na­tional Geo­graphic mag­a­zine put Mex­i­can pho­tog­ra­pher Jorge Gam­boa’s now-iconic im­age of a plas­tic bag ice­berg on its cover, says Ms Honor Harger, ArtS­cience’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“We are talk­ing about a dis­turb­ing topic, but we are do­ing it in a way that’s visu­ally ar­rest­ing, that will hit peo­ple in the heart and in the head,” she says.</p>
    <p>The show is di­vided into sec­tions, cov­er­ing the in­ven­tion of plas­tics to their rise as mass con­sumer items to ways of com­bat­ing the prob­lem of plas­tic pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Harger says it aims to present a holis­tic view of plas­tic. “It is im­por­tant to point out how rev­o­lu­tion­ary plas­tic has been in the 20th cen­tury. In medicine, for ex­am­ple, it is hard to imag­ine mod­ern hos­pi­tals with­out plas­tic. Our front-line work­ers are kept safer through plas­tics.”</p>
    <p>The im­pact has come from the rise of sin­gle-use plas­tic as well as the lack of large-scale meth­ods of deal­ing with plas­tic waste which takes 450 years to break down.</p>
    <p>Ms Harger adds: “To the three Rs of re­duce, re­use and re­cy­cle, we need to add an­other R, which is to refuse to use plas­tic.”</p>
    <p>Hence the fi­nal sec­tion of the show in­vites vis­i­tors to think about ways they can help to mit­i­gate plas­tic pol­lu­tion. “The over­rid­ing mes­sage we want peo­ple to take away is how they can ac­tively make a dif­fer­ence so it’s not an over­whelm­ing prob­lem that other peo­ple have to tackle, but an is­sue they can do some­thing about.”</p>
    <p>The show ends with an in­ter­ac­tive seg­ment which, thanks to the pan­demic, has redi­rected the mu­seum’s tra­di­tional hands-on ap­proach to a “feet first” in­ter­ac­tion. A se­ries of quizzes are set up and vis­i­tors can an­swer by tap­ping their feet on but­tons.</p>
    <p>Ms Harger says the show, de­signed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, is very much a prod­uct of the times: “If it were a tra­di­tional tour­ing ex­hi­bi­tion, it would have been re­ally dif­fi­cult for us to stage.”</p>
    <p>The pho­tog­ra­phy was “dig­i­tally shipped” from Na­tional Geo­graphic and the ex­hi­bi­tion was de­signed and built lo­cally. With the pan­demic in mind, the lay­out of­fers plenty of room for so­cially dis­tanced view­ing.</p>
    <p>She adds: “We want to make sure when peo­ple do come, they have space to en­joy the works.”</p>
