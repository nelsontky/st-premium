    <p>There are many job op­por­tu­ni­ties in the health­care in­dus­try (Close to 5,500 jobs on of­fer in Sin­ga­pore’s health­care sec­tor, Dec 11), but the real chal­lenge is how to re­tain these work­ers, given the im­pact of age-old prac­tices in the hos­pi­tal en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>In one hos­pi­tal, for ex­am­ple, health­care work­ers end their af­ter­noon shift at 10pm and very of­ten have to re­port for duty the next morn­ing at 7am. Tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion com­mut­ing time, they may not be able to get enough sleep.</p>
    <p>In the long run, it takes a toll on their bod­ies and will af­fect how they dis­charge their du­ties, bear­ing in mind that a hos­pi­tal can­not al­low mis­takes to oc­cur, es­pe­cially when dis­pens­ing med­i­ca­tion to pa­tients. There is an ur­gent need to change the shift hours by, for ex­am­ple, start­ing the af­ter­noon shift ear­lier.</p>
    <p>In one hos­pi­tal, the per­sonal care as­sis­tants (PCAs) went through a 20-day pro­gramme, which is barely suf­fi­cient to get them skilled enough to work in the wards.</p>
    <p>As­sist­ing in ba­sic care ac­tiv­i­ties is com­plex as they need to know how to mon­i­tor vi­tal signs that war­rant im­me­di­ate at­ten­tion. They also need to un­der­stand the be­hav­iour of el­derly pa­tients who are emo­tion­ally vul­ner­a­ble, es­pe­cially those di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>If reg­is­tered nurses need to be en­rolled in a two-year pro­gramme, I feel that PCAs should have at least six months of train­ing.</p>
    <p>Also, se­nior nurses in the ward could pro­vide a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for new hires. The model of men­tor­ship should change.</p>
    <p>Many se­nior nurses seem to be more fo­cused on “com­mand­ing” new­bies to do the right thing in the rush to make ev­ery PCA as com­pe­tent as a qual­i­fied nurse, which takes time, par­tic­u­larly given the short learn­ing run­way they went through.</p>
    <p>The nurses could in­stead place more em­pha­sis on shar­ing their knowl­edge and ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The ob­ject, af­ter all, is not to make a PCA feel good or to make him feel bad. It is to en­cour­age him to do bet­ter.</p>
