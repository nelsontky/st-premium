    <p>The Amer­i­can mag­a­zine’s ed­i­tor-in-chief Dan Wake­ford said the four were cho­sen for their tal­ent as well as for be­ing “forces for good in the world”.</p>
    <p>Gomez l aunched her chart­top­ping al­bum Rare in Jan­uary and hosted the cook­ing show Se­lena + Chef.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old singer is one of the most-fol­lowed celebri­ties on In­sta­gram with more than 195 mil­lion fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>She was praised for us­ing the plat­form to sup­port the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment in June af­ter the death of black Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd while in po­lice cus­tody in May.</p>
    <p>Gomez also launched Rare</p>
    <p>Beauty, an in­clu­sive make-up brand which has set the goal of rais­ing US$100 mil­lion (S$134 mil­lion) in 10 years to help give peo­ple ac­cess to men­tal health ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Her will­ing­ness to dis­cuss her own men­tal health j our­ney and com­mit­ment to help­ing oth­ers is in­spir­ing, ac­cord­ing to Mr Wake­ford.</p>
    <p>Clooney, who is al­ready touted for pos­si­ble Os­car nom­i­na­tions for The Mid­night Sky, the sci­ence-fic­tion film which he di­rected and starred in, was noted for his civil rights ad­vo­cacy.</p>
    <p>The 59-year-old celebrity had do­nated US$500,000 to the Equal Jus­tice Ini­tia­tive af­ter Mr Floyd’s death, US$1 mil­lion for Covid-19 re­lief ef­forts in Italy, Lon­don and Los An­ge­les, and sig­nif­i­cant aid to Le­banese char­i­ties af­ter the deadly ex­plo­sion in Beirut in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>King, 49, won the Academy Award for Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress last year for her role in ro­man­tic drama If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) and an Emmy for Out­stand­ing Lead Ac­tress in a Lim­ited Series in Septem­ber for her role in su­per­hero drama Watch­men (2019).</p>
    <p>She has been lauded for call­ing for sup­port for marginalis­ed com­mu­ni­ties dur­ing the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic and an end to po­lice vi­o­lence in the United States.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci, 79, di­rec­tor of the US Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases and the best­known mem­ber of the White House Coro­n­avirus Task Force, was hailed for pro­vid­ing steady guid­ance in the coun­try dur­ing the pan­demic and for re­main­ing out front de­spite him and his fam­ily fac­ing death threats.</p>
