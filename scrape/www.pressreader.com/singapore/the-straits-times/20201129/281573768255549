    <p>A 68-year-old man, who had a his­tory of hy­per­ten­sion and heart dis­ease, has died from com­pli­ca­tions due to Covid-19, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is the 29th pa­tient to die from the virus here, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>He had trav­elled to In­done­sia on March 10 for work, and re­turned to Sin­ga­pore on Nov 17 after ex­pe­ri­enc­ing short­ness of breath on Nov 11. Upon ar­rival here, he was ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The man was con­firmed to have the Covid-19 in­fec­tion on Nov 18 and died on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The cause of death was de­ter­mined to be is­chaemic heart dis­ease with Covid-19, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal has reached out to the man’s fam­ily and is ex­tend­ing as­sis­tance to them.</p>
    <p>The last pa­tient to die here from Covid-19-re­lated com­pli­ca­tions was a 64-year-old man, as re­ported by MOH on Oct 12. He was di­ag­nosed with the coro­n­avirus on Oct 4.</p>
    <p>Six new coro­n­avirus cases were an­nounced by MOH yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing a lo­cally trans­mit­ted com­mu­nity case.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal case is a 60-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman who sells mut­ton with a co-worker at a stall in Tekka Mar­ket.</p>
    <p>She lives in Yishun Street 22 with her hus­band, who has been work­ing at Mustafa Cen­tre for the past few years. She reg­u­larly visits her chil­dren who live in Bis­han Street 13 and Tampines Street 86.</p>
    <p>She is asymp­to­matic and was de­tected from MOH’s sur­veil­lance test­ing of stall­hold­ers in and near Tekka Cen­tre on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>MOH said all her iden­ti­fied close con­tacts, in­clud­ing her fam­ily mem­bers and co-worker, have been iso­lated and placed in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>They will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod to de­tect any asymp­to­matic cases.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will also con­duct sero­log­i­cal tests on the woman’s house­hold and fam­ily con­tacts to de­ter­mine if she could have been in­fected by them.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing five new cases an­nounced yes­ter­day are im­ported, and were placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There were no new cases from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,205.</p>
    <p>With eight cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,119 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 32 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 25 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
