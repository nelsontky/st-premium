    <p>Af­ter more than nine months of sep­a­ra­tion be­cause of bor­der con­trols, Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who are in re­la­tion­ships with for­eign part­ners are fi­nally be­ing re­united. About a month ago, the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity added a new “spouse-to-be” cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Af­ter more than nine months of sep­a­ra­tion be­cause of Covid-19 bor­der con­trols, Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who are in re­la­tion­ships with for­eign part­ners are fi­nally be­ing re­united.</p>
    <p>About a month ago, the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) added a new “spouse-to-be” cat­e­gory in the ap­pli­ca­tion form for for­eign­ers who wish to en­ter Sin­ga­pore amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It al­lows for­eign­ers in re­la­tion­ships with Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens or per­ma­nent res­i­dents to come here on a short-term visit pass even if they are not mar­ried.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times con­tacted the ICA but it did not pro­vide de­tails of the re­quire­ments for a visa to be ap­proved un­der the new cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, it said it will “gen­er­ally be fa­cil­i­ta­tive of for­eign­ers who are im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers or rel­a­tives of a Sin­ga­pore ci­ti­zen or per­ma­nent res­i­dent, or a spouse-to-be of a Sin­ga­pore ci­ti­zen or a PR”.</p>
    <p>It added that the du­ra­tion of stay granted will be as­sessed and de­ter­mined at the point of en­try.</p>
    <p>A check on the au­thor­ity’s web­site did not re­veal any in­di­ca­tion that proof is needed of the re­la­tion­ship. The on­line form states that both par­ties must pro­vide their de­tails in the ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Prior to the in­tro­duc­tion of the new cat­e­gory, only for­eign­ers who are im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers or rel­a­tives of Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens or per­ma­nent res­i­dents were al­lowed to en­ter the coun­try. Those fac­ing ex­ten­u­at­ing cir­cum­stances, such as the death of a loved one, could also be given per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Those who have suc­cess­fully ap­plied un­der the new spouse-to-be cat­e­gory said they were told to pay for a Covid-19 test, as well as for a 14-day stay at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity to serve their stay-home no­tice (SHN), within three days of the ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Af­ter pay­ing $2,200 per per­son, they are given a four-day win­dow</p>
    <p>48, who has not met her English fi­ance who lives in Birm­ing­ham, Eng­land, in the past 10 months. Those who suc­cess­fully ap­ply un­der the new spouse-to-be cat­e­gory have to pay $2,200 for a Covid-19 test as well as for a 14-day stay at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity to serve their stay-home no­tice. by the ICA to en­ter the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ms Priscil­lia Lau, a re­cent grad­u­ate of Columbia Univer­sity in the United States, said her Amer­i­can part­ner of 17 months ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from New York on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He is now serv­ing his SHN at In­ter­Con­ti­nen­tal Sin­ga­pore Robert­son Quay and can re­main here for up to 90 days.</p>
    <p>Ms Lau, 24, a civil ser­vant, who has been back in Sin­ga­pore since June, was ini­tially not op­ti­mistic about her part­ner’s prospects of en­ter­ing the coun­try as the US has been ex­pe­ri­enc­ing five-digit new in­fec­tions a day since March.</p>
    <p>But it took only a week for his short-term visit pass ap­pli­ca­tion to be ap­proved on Oct 23.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t pick him up at the air­port when he ar­rived, but we’ll fi­nally get to see each other af­ter nine months,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ms Rashida Rahman has not met her English fi­ance who lives in Birm­ing­ham, Eng­land, in the past 10 months, and their re­union con­tin­ues to be put on hold. He was last here in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“We are grate­ful to the Govern­ment for giv­ing us the flex­i­bil­ity to bring our part­ners over, but $2,200 is no small sum, on top of hav­ing to pay for plane tick­ets. We are wait­ing for a travel bub­ble be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Bri­tain so that there’s no need to quar­an­tine,” said Ms Rahman, 48, a sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>Bri­tons and Amer­i­cans are al­lowed to leave their own coun­tries, with some re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Separately, Ms Ash­ley Toh, a 30-year-old ed­u­ca­tor, said her</p>
    <p>HIGH COST</p>
    <p>We are grate­ful to the Govern­ment for giv­ing us the flex­i­bil­ity to bring our part­ners over, but $2,200 is no small sum, on top of hav­ing to pay for plane tick­ets. We are wait­ing for a travel bub­ble be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Bri­tain so that there’s no need to quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>South Korean fi­ance would have to be quar­an­tined for two weeks in Sin­ga­pore and an­other two weeks when he re­turns to South Korea.</p>
    <p>“That’s a month of SHN in to­tal, which his work is not able to ac­com­mo­date,” she said.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were go­ing to tie the knot here in May but had to can­cel their wed­ding plans be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Many like Ms Toh have sought sup­port through a Face­book group called Love is Not Tourism Sin­ga­pore, which has over 570 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The group is one of many that</p>
    <p>have sprung up over the course of the pan­demic as in­ter­na­tional cou­ples are forced to stay apart.</p>
    <p>“The group has of­fered me im­mense sup­port... all of us in sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tions are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the same pain of not know­ing when we will see our part­ners again,” said Ms Toh.</p>
    <p>“But ev­ery­one has been very forth­com­ing in of­fer­ing ad­vice and cel­e­brat­ing to­gether when some­one gets ap­proved to come over.”</p>
    <p>MS RASHIDA RAHMAN,</p>
