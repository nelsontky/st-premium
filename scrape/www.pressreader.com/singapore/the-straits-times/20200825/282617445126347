    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are get­ting mixed sig­nals. Things are sure to make more sense soon, but you have to ride out this short phase first.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You may find that you need to deal with some­thing that is harder than it should be. The good news is that this leads to some se­ri­ous in­sights.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Look to oth­ers for in­spi­ra­tion and try to help them with what­ever they need. Your good en­ergy is per­fect for vol­un­teer­ing.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing in­de­ci­sive, so make sure you are not on the precipice of big events. If you are, get help from a wise friend be­fore ven­tur­ing forth.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Take two or three looks be­fore pulling the trig­ger. The good news is that you are sure to know when you are ready.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your in­ter­est in learn­ing is height­ened and that means it is time to dig into a mys­tery that has been bug­ging you for ages.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are well set for tak­ing care of busi­ness mat­ters, so get started. Make deals, get good bar­gains and ne­go­ti­ate with prac­ti­cally any­one.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your in­ten­sity is both a bless­ing and a curse. Some­times it draws peo­ple to you, while at other times, it keeps peo­ple at arm’s length.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Do you re­mem­ber your dreams? Even if you can never quite hold on to them when you wake up, they are still work­ing their magic on you.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) A friend comes to you with some news or a re­quest. Pay at­ten­tion and help him or her out – this is the start of a big ad­ven­ture for you.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Try to fo­cus on your work­ing life. Things are look­ing up for you, but you have to make sure you are push­ing your­self as hard as you can.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You may feel like peo­ple are tak­ing ad­van­tage of you, but you are help­ing them with­out their hav­ing to ask, so you get twice the karma.</p>
