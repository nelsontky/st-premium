    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land’s econ­omy con­tracted the most in more than two decades, deep­en­ing its re­ces­sion as the na­tion’s key driv­ers of trade and tourism remain hob­bled by the global coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct shrank 12.2 per cent from a year ago, the Na­tional Eco­nomic and So­cial Devel­op­ment Coun­cil said yes­ter­day, its big­gest de­cline since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 1998. The fig­ure was not quite as bad as the me­dian es­ti­mate of a 13 per cent con­trac­tion in a Bloomberg sur­vey of economists.</p>
    <p>The out­look for Thai­land’s econ­omy this year is the most dire in Asia, given its re­liance on ex­ports and tourism, both of which have suf­fered heavy blows amid the Covid-19 out­break. The pain has been com­pounded by the strong baht, which gained more than 6 per cent in the April-June quar­ter, the sec­ond-best per­form­ing cur­rency in Asia</p>
    <p>Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>“We are con­cerned about the econ­omy, espe­cially em­ploy­ment, bad debts” and small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises, said Dr Thos­aporn Sirisump­hand, sec­re­tary­gen­eral of the eco­nomic coun­cil. “We will try to take care of 16 mil­lion work­ers in the in­for­mal sec­tor. We have pre­pared mea­sures to help them.”</p>
    <p>The coun­cil cut its full-year forecast to a 7.3 per cent to 7.8 per cent con­trac­tion, from an ear­lier es­ti­mate of a 5 per cent to 6 per cent fall. That is still bet­ter than the 8.1 per cent fall seen by the cen­tral bank and the 8.5 per cent de­cline the Finance Min­istry ex­pects.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank econ­o­mist Howie Lee said: “The worst is likely over, but there is still no rea­son to pop the cham­pagne yet. From here, we ex­pect the pace of eco­nomic re­cov­ery to be grad­ual, with many chal­lenges still fac­ing the Thai econ­omy.” tracked by</p>
