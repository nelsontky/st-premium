    <p>LON­DON Bri­tain’s busi­nesses had a clear re­sponse to Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son af­ter he told them to get ready for a no-deal Brexit: Do not do this in the mid­dle of a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son is­sued his threat on Fri­day, say­ing the Euro­pean Union was re­fus­ing to “ne­go­ti­ate se­ri­ously”.</p>
    <p>His re­marks were quickly fol­lowed by warn­ings from the na­tion’s trade groups of the cost and dis­rup­tion that would be trig­gered by a de­par­ture from the bloc without a trade agree­ment.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter four years of ne­go­ti­a­tions and so many hur­dles crossed, this is no time to give up,” Ms Carolyn Fair­bairn, direc­tor-gen­eral of the Con­fed­er­a­tion of Bri­tish In­dus­try, the na­tion’s big­gest busi­ness lobby, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“A deal is the only out­come that pro­tects Covid-hit liveli­hoods at a time when ev­ery job in ev­ery coun­try counts.”</p>
    <p>The In­sti­tute of Di­rec­tors said a poll of its 26,000 mem­bers found that 54 per cent thought that end­ing the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod on Dec 31 without a trade agree­ment would ex­ac­er­bate the pan­demic’s im­pact on their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The na­tion’s smaller com­pa­nies had a sim­i­lar view. They still do not know what trad­ing re­la­tion­ship they will face with the bloc as time runs out, and many do not have the re­sources to pre­pare, ac­cord­ing to na­tional chair­man of the Fed­er­a­tion of Small Busi­nesses Mike Cherry.</p>
    <p>“They’re be­ing told to both pre­pare and si­mul­ta­ne­ously man­age a fresh set of Covid re­stric­tions,” he said in a state­ment. “Many sim­ply don’t have the time or money to make ad­just­ments, even if they want and need to.”</p>
    <p>Mr John­son had pre­vi­ously said that last Thurs­day would be the dead­line for as­sess­ing whether there was a clear path to a trade deal – if not, that would be the time to walk away from talks.</p>
    <p>His an­nounce­ment that busi­nesses must pre­pare for the re­sump­tion of trade tar­iffs and quo­tas with</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s big­gest trad­ing part­ner came just as his govern­ment tight­ened re­stric­tions in a num­ber of Bri­tish re­gions to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus. Lon­don is among those fac­ing stricter rules.</p>
    <p>Ms Cather­ine McGuin­ness, pol­icy chair of the City of Lon­don Cor­po­ra­tion, high­lighted the strains caused to the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try from the push to get more peo­ple to work from home, as she urged that govern­ment ef­forts are “re­dou­bled” to reach a Brexit deal.</p>
    <p>While any deal now would be “very light on de­tail”, it would be “much bet­ter if we leave on a har­mo­nious ba­sis than have a no-deal</p>
    <p>exit”, she said in an interview. “My big­gest fear is an ac­ri­mo­nious exit.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s re­tail and food and drink in­dus­tries, which to­gether em­ploy well over five mil­lion peo­ple, have re­acted with dis­may to the prospect of a re­turn of tar­iffs and snarls at key en­try points.</p>
    <p>Shops are al­ready strug­gling to cope with the clo­sures and dis­tanc­ing re­quired by virus con­tain­ment mea­sures, as well as the surge in on­line shop­ping.</p>
    <p>Mr John Al­lan, chair­man of Bri­tain’s largest su­per­mar­ket chain Tesco told Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion on Fri­day that there could be short­term short­ages of some fresh food</p>
    <p>if there was “dis­lo­ca­tion” at Bri­tish en­try ports.</p>
    <p>“There is noth­ing re­tail­ers can do to in­su­late con­sumers from the im­pact of £3 bil­lion (S$5.26 bil­lion) of new tar­iffs on food in our su­per­mar­kets,” said Ms He­len Dick­in­son, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Bri­tish Re­tail Con­sor­tium, in a state­ment. “More­over, new checks and red tape that will ap­ply from Jan 1 will cre­ate ad­di­tional dis­rup­tion in the sup­ply of many goods that come from or through the Euro­pean Union.”</p>
    <p>Car­mak­ers, whose just-in-time fac­to­ries de­pend on an un­in­ter­rupted flow of goods through ports, share the con­cerns about queues of</p>
    <p>trucks stuck at the border.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, rat­ings com­pany Moody’s cut Bri­tain’s debt rat­ing on Fri­day over the huge eco­nomic hit from the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, Brexit and the lack of clear bud­get plans from Mr John­son’s govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Moody’s low­ered the rat­ing to Aa3 from Aa2, putting Bri­tain – the world’s sixth-big­gest econ­omy – on the same level as Bel­gium and the Czech Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish pound, which swung be­tween gains and losses through much of Fri­day, budged only slightly af­ter the Moody’s an­nounce­ment, end­ing the day lit­tle changed at US$1.2915.</p>
