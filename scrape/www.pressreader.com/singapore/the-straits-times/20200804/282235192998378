    <p>Fears of a global resur­gence in Covid-19 un­nerved lo­cal in­vestors, who sent the mar­ket down for its third straight ses­sion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times In­dex (STI) ended 44.91 points or 1.78 per cent lower at 2,484.91, with 1.55 bil­lion shares worth $1.73 bil­lion chang­ing hands. Losers out­num­bered gain­ers 281 to 190.</p>
    <p>In­vestor un­cer­tainty hit the in­dus­tri­als-heavy STI – which in­cludes Kep­pel Corp, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and Sats – es­pe­cially hard.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty and bank coun­ters also con­trib­uted to the drub­bing.</p>
    <p>A sea­son­ally weak Au­gust is in view for United States shares, said IG mar­ket strate­gist Jingyi Pan, while con­cerns about a slow­ing pace of re­cov­ery and re­newed USChina ten­sions could be trig­gers for move­ments in Asia this week.</p>
    <p>She added: “The 5.51 per cent gain for the com­pre­hen­sive S&P 500 in­dex in July falls in line with the sea­son­al­ity trend and marks the strong­est July seen since 2010.</p>
    <p>“Au­gust, how­ever, holds a sig­nif­i­cantly weaker per­for­mance by sea­son­al­ity for US equities.”</p>
    <p>Top loser Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings fell 7.23 per cent to US$37.96, af­ter its first-half un­der­ly­ing net profit came in be­low ex­pec­ta­tions last Thurs­day due to Covid-19. The in­dex heavy­weight also warned in­vestors that its se­cond-half per­for­mance would be dif­fi­cult to pre­dict.</p>
    <p>CGS-CIMB an­a­lyst Wil­liam Tng raised Jar­dine Mathe­son from “hold” to “add” over the week­end, but low­ered his tar­get price from US$52.53 to US$48.61.</p>
    <p>Top gainer UG Health­care rose 14.57 per cent to $2.91.</p>
    <p>Medtecs In­ter­na­tional was the most ac­tive, ris­ing 12.22 per cent to $1.01 on vol­umes of 76.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Moya Hold­ings Asia was the se­cond most ac­tive, surg­ing 22.03 per cent to 7.2 cents with 47.4 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands. The In­done­sian wa­ter-treat­ment firm re­ported a net profit of $16.6 mil­lion in the first half, up 167 per cent from the same pe­riod a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets were mixed with lo­cal and global fac­tors weigh­ing on in­vestors. The Hang Seng fell 0.56 per cent while the KLSE shed 1.94 per cent as con­cerns over USChina ten­sions stayed on the boil.</p>
    <p>But equities in Ja­pan and China were boosted by promis­ing eco­nomic data. The Shang­hai Com­pos­ite climbed 1.75 per cent while the Nikkei ad­vanced 2.24 per cent.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian shares de­clined to lows not seen since June 30 as Vic­to­ria im­posed se­vere move­ment curbs to rein in a spike in in­fec­tions.</p>
