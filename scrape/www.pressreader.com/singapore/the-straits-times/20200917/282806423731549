    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Show some­one you can help him or her out, prefer­ably by tack­ling his or her big is­sue before be­ing asked to do so. You can earn bonus karma.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your emo­tional side is work­ing over­time, but that just means you fi­nally fig­ure out that one friend or ro­man­tic in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Try not to get lost in the chat­ter. Your en­ergy is right for lis­ten­ing, but maybe not so much for hold­ing court.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Pour your ef­forts into tidy­ing up at home or at work. Then try to get your peo­ple to see the value of keep­ing things neat.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your fi­nan­cial ar­range­ments are driv­ing you a lit­tle crazy, but you should be able to make one small tweak that helps in a re­ally big way.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You need to be more help­ful, even if it is a chal­leng­ing task. It is a good time to pull out all the stops and re­ally let go.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Try not to lose it when you see how many things you have to take care of. If you can chill out, you should see that it is all part of the plan.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You need to in­dulge a friend, maybe one you have not seen in a while. Let him or her ram­ble, then hug him or her before say­ing good­bye.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) You find that you have to force some­thing, but you have what it takes. That said, do not rush through things.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Plan for the fu­ture, whether that means next week or 10 years from now. Things can get a lot bet­ter if you fig­ure it all out ahead of time.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Work deals are trou­ble – stay fo­cused on your projects and let oth­ers deal with theirs. Things are eas­ier to fig­ure out if you wait.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion does not make sense, but do not fret. If you re­act flex­i­bly to the events of the day, you should do just fine.</p>
