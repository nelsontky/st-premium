    <p>PH­NOM PENH • The Kh­mer Rouge com­man­der Kaing Guek Eav, known as Com­rade Duch – Pol Pot’s main ex­e­cu­tioner and se­cu­rity chief who over­saw the mur­der of at least 14,000 Cam­bo­di­ans at the no­to­ri­ous Tuol Sleng prison – died yes­ter­day. He was 77.</p>
    <p>Duch was the first mem­ber of the Kh­mer Rouge lead­er­ship to face trial for his role in a regime blamed for at l east 1.7 mil­lion deaths in the “killing fields” of Cam­bo­dia from 1975 to 1979.</p>
    <p>He died at 12.52am at the Kh­mer Soviet Friend­ship Hospi­tal in Ph­nom Penh, said Mr Neth Pheak­tra, a spokesman for a tri­bunal set up to pros­e­cute top Kh­mer Rouge lead­ers. He gave no de­tails of the cause of death, but Duch had been ill in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>In 2010, the United Na­tions­backed tri­bunal found him guilty of mass mur­der, tor­ture and crimes against hu­man­ity at Tuol Sleng prison, a for­mer Ph­nom Penh high school that still stands as a memo­rial to the atroc­i­ties com­mit­ted in­side.</p>
    <p>He was given a life sen­tence two years later af­ter his ap­peal, on the grounds that he was just a ju­nior of­fi­cial fol­low­ing or­ders, was re­jected.</p>
    <p>Duch – by the time of his trial a born-again Christian – ex­pressed re­gret for his crimes.</p>
    <p>United States am­bas­sador to Cam­bo­dia W. Patrick Mur­phy, in a com­ment on Twit­ter, called his con­vic­tion “a mile­stone in en­sur­ing</p>
    <p>ac­count­abil­ity”.</p>
    <p>Duch was one of only a hand­ful of top Kh­mer Rouge fig­ures con­victed be­fore they died. Para­mount leader Pol Pot died in a Kh­mer Rouge jun­gle hide­out in 1998.</p>
    <p>Un­der Duch’s lead­er­ship, de­tainees at Tuol Sleng prison, co­de­named “S-21”, were or­dered to sup­press cries of agony as Kh­mer Rouge guards, many of whom were teenagers, sought to ex­tract con­fes­sions for non-ex­is­tent crimes through tor­ture.</p>
    <p>The guards were in­structed to “smash to bits” traitors and counter-rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing in the for­mer school­house took place with­out Duch’s ap­proval. His con­trol was to­tal,” wrote pho­tog­ra­pher and author Nic Dun­lop, who found Duch in 1999 hid­ing near the Thai bor­der, two decades af­ter the Kh­mer Rouge fell.</p>
    <p>“Not un­til you walk through the empty cor­ri­dors of Tuol Sleng does Stalin’s id­iom that one death is a tragedy – a mil­lion a statis­tic, take on a ter­ri­fy­ing po­tency,” Mr Dun­lop wrote in his ac­count of Duch and his atroc­i­ties, The Lost Ex­e­cu­tioner.</p>
