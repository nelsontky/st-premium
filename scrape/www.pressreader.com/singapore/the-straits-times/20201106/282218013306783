    <p>DBS Bank and OCBC Bank have joined fel­low lender United Over­seas Bank in post­ing bet­ter-thanex­pected third-quar­ter earn­ings while set­ting aside more al­lowances for po­ten­tial bad loans amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal banks also struck a cau­tiously op­ti­mistic tone as re­gional economies pick up pace, and said that they have am­ple pro­vi­sions to tide over un­cer­tain­ties ahead.</p>
    <p>DBS Group Hold­ings re­ported yes­ter­day that third-quar­ter net profit fell 20 per cent to $1.3 bil­lion from $1.63 bil­lion a year ear­lier, but well ahead of the $1.12 bil­lion av­er­age es­ti­mate of an­a­lysts in a Bloomberg poll.</p>
    <p>The bank noted that it recorded lower net in­ter­est in­come and al­lo­cated higher al­lowances for po­ten­tial bad loans.</p>
    <p>It has de­clared an in­terim div­i­dend of 18 cents a share, down from 30 cents last year. The bank’s scrip div­i­dend scheme will be ap­plied.</p>
    <p>DBS, South-east Asia’s largest bank, set aside al­lowances of $554 mil­lion in the third quar­ter. To­gether with $1.94 bil­lion in the first half of the year, to­tal al­lowances in the first nine months quadru­pled to $2.49 bil­lion from a year ear­lier. Around $1.5 bil­lion of this were gen­eral al­lowances set aside to for­tify the bal­ance sheet against macroe­co­nomic risks.</p>
    <p>Net in­ter­est in­come fell 12 per cent year on year to $2.17 bil­lion – and was 6 per cent down on the sec­ond quar­ter – as loan growth was off­set by a lower net in­ter­est mar­gin. Net in­ter­est mar­gin – a key gauge of prof­itabil­ity for banks – fell nine ba­sis points to 1.53 per cent as the im­pact of global in­ter­est rate cuts in March and April was more fully felt.</p>
    <p>An­nu­alised earn­ings per share stood at $1.98 for the quar­ter, down from $2.50 a year ago.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the sec­ond quar­ter, net profit rose 4 per cent as fee in­come re­bounded 17 per cent to pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>DBS chief ex­ec­u­tive Piyush Gupta said the third-quar­ter re­sults re­flect a re­cov­ery in busi­ness mo­men­tum as re­gional economies</p>
    <p>emerge from lock­downs. “The re­bound in fee in­come to pre-Covid lev­els has en­abled us to cush­ion the full im­pact of lower in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, the ac­cel­er­ated build-up of al­lowances has strength­ened our abil­ity to meet the chal­lenges of an un­even eco­nomic re­cov­ery in the com­ing year,” he said.</p>
    <p>Net profit for the first nine months fell 24 per cent to $3.71 bil­lion due to the higher al­lowances.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, OCBC’s net profit dipped 12 per cent to $1.03 bil­lion from $1.17 bil­lion a year ear­lier on the back of lower net in­ter­est in­come and more al­lowances set aside for loans. Its earn­ings topped the $850 mil­lion av­er­age es­ti­mate of an­a­lysts sur­veyed by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Net in­ter­est in­come fell 11 per cent year on year to $1.42 bil­lion, amid low in­ter­est rates. To­tal al­lowances in­creased 8 per cent year on year to $350 mil­lion, but fell from $750 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter. Net profit rose 41 per cent from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter on the back of the lower al­lowances.</p>
    <p>OCBC chief ex­ec­u­tive Sa­muel Tsien said the eco­nomic out­look is still un­cer­tain and it is im­por­tant for the bank to con­tinue strength­en­ing its cap­i­tal and bal­ance sheet.</p>
    <p>UOB posted its third-quar­ter re­sults on Wed­nes­day, with net profit down 40 per cent to $668 mil­lion from $1.12 bil­lion a year ear­lier. It set aside an ad­di­tional $339 mil­lion in credit al­lowances for non-im­paired as­sets to strengthen pro­vi­sion cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Its earn­ings topped the $641 mil­lion av­er­age fore­cast in a Bloomberg poll.</p>
    <p>DBS shares climbed 88 cents, or 4.08 per cent, to $22.43, OCBC rose 3.48 per cent to $8.93, while UOB gained 3.23 per cent to $20.44. The Straits Times In­dex was up 2.89 per cent.</p>
    <p>DBS chief ex­ec­u­tive Piyush Gupta said the third-quar­ter re­sults re­flect a re­cov­ery in busi­ness mo­men­tum as re­gional economies emerge from lock­downs. “The re­bound in fee in­come to pre-Covid lev­els has en­abled us to cush­ion the full im­pact of lower in­ter­est rates,” he said.</p>
