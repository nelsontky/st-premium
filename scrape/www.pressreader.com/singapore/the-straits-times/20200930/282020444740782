    <p>The Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) has an­nounced a change in se­nior lead­er­ship. On Nov 1, Mr Des­mond Chin will be tak­ing over from Dr Ang Hak Seng as com­mis­sioner of char­i­ties (COC) and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Registry of Co-op­er­a­tive So­ci­eties and Mu­tual Ben­e­fit Or­gan­i­sa­tions (RCS).</p>
    <p>Mr Chin pre­vi­ously served as the com­mis­sioner of pris­ons, a po­si­tion he held from Oc­to­ber 2016 to Mon­day. He was awarded the Public Ad­min­is­tra­tion Medal (Gold) this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Chin will join MCCY to­mor­row as COC-des­ig­nate and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor-des­ig­nate of the RCS.</p>
    <p>The COC’s roles in­clude main­tain­ing public trust and con­fi­dence in char­i­ties, en­hanc­ing the ac­count­abil­ity of char­i­ties to donors and pro­mot­ing com­pli­ance to govern­ment reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>On his up­com­ing ap­point­ment at MCCY, Mr Chin, 55, em­pha­sised the importance of char­i­ties to build­ing car­ing com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“Our char­i­ties, co-op­er­a­tives and mu­tual ben­e­fit or­gan­i­sa­tions are im­por­tant sec­tors in help­ing to build car­ing and co­he­sive com­mu­ni­ties. I look for­ward to ex­pand­ing on the ex­cel­lent work of Hak Seng and his team, and work­ing closely with our stake­hold­ers and part­ners to achieve th­ese ends,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ang, 60, will con­tinue to be MCCY’s deputy sec­re­tary (spe­cial du­ties), lead­ing the min­istry’s ef­forts in grow­ing Sin­ga­pore Cares, a na­tional move­ment to foster a more car­ing, com­pas­sion­ate and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>He as­sumed his cur­rent role as COC and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the RCS in Jan­uary 2017. He pre­vi­ously served as the chief ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion from April 2013 to Jan­uary 2017.</p>
    <p>On his con­tin­u­ing role with Sin­ga­pore Cares and leav­ing his cur­rent po­si­tion, Dr Ang said in the state­ment: “Through our col­lec­tive ef­forts, we can build a car­ing Sin­ga­pore where no one is left be­hind.</p>
    <p>“I want to thank the char­ity sec­tor for their sup­port dur­ing my ten­ure as COC, and ask that they sup­port Des­mond in his new ap­point­ment.”</p>
