    <p>Hong Kong will al­low gyms, mas­sage par­lours and some sports venues to re­open from to­mor­row, as coro­n­avirus cases drop off from record highs. Restau­rants’ dine-in ser­vices will be ex­tended by an hour, but bars, karaoke lounges and swim­ming pools will re­main closed.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment said it will al­low gyms, mas­sage par­lours and some sports venues to re­open, be­gin­ning to­mor­row, as coro­n­avirus cases drop off from record highs.</p>
    <p>In a fur­ther re­lax­ation of rules, dine-in ser­vices at restau­rants will be ex­tended by one hour, to 10pm, said Sec­re­tary for Food and Health Sophia Chan in a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We lis­tened to the cit­i­zens telling us that some­times it’s a bit rushed... hav­ing din­ner, be­cause Hong Kong peo­ple tend to work late, and so there­fore slightly ex­tend­ing by one hour would serve the pur­pose,” Ra­dio Tele­vi­sion Hong Kong (RTHK) quoted Ms Chan as say­ing.</p>
    <p>A cap of two peo­ple at each ta­ble will re­main in ef­fect at restau­rants, while pub­lic gather­ings will be lim­ited to two peo­ple for an­other seven days.</p>
    <p>How­ever, bars, karaoke lounges, mahjong par­lours and swim­ming pools re­main closed.</p>
    <p>“We have yet to see a sta­ble sit­u­a­tion,” Ms Chan told a news brief­ing. “Ev­ery­one must main­tain a cer­tain de­gree of so­cial dis­tanc­ing.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has been grad­u­ally eas­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures as it brings its big­gest Covid-19 out­break un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>The Asian fi­nan­cial hub an­nounced ear­lier that schools are to re­sume face-to-face teach­ing from Sept 23, among the eas­ing of mea­sures that have kept 900,000 stu­dents at home for more than four months.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is also in the midst of a Bei­jing-backed cam­paign to have ev­ery­one in the city tested, with about 745,000 res­i­dents reg­is­tered for it as at yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong, which saw daily case num­bers top 100 as re­cently as a month ago, re­ported eight new virus cases yes­ter­day, all of which were lo­cally trans­mit­ted, with four of them hav­ing an un­known ori­gin.</p>
    <p>De­spite the eas­ing of virus mea­sures, how­ever, for the sec­ond year in a row, the city will can­cel the an­nual fire­work dis­play to mark China’s na­tional day on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>Pro-democ­racy protests made last year’s cel­e­bra­tions dif­fi­cult, and they have be­come fewer and smaller this year, ow­ing mainly to lim­its on group gather­ings and the im­po­si­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity law that pun­ishes ac­tions China views as sub­ver­sive, se­ces­sion­ist, ter­ror­ist or col­lud­ing with for­eign forces.</p>
    <p>“In re­sponse to the lat­est sit­u­a­tion of the Covid-19 epi­demic, the Na­tional Day fire­works... will be can­celled,” the gov­ern­ment said in a state­ment on the cel­e­bra­tions, which usu­ally take place near the pic­turesque Victoria Har­bour.</p>
    <p>While Hong Kong is re­open­ing gyms in an ef­fort to im­prove res­i­dents’ phys­i­cal and men­tal health, masks will still be re­quired when ex­er­cis­ing.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions have been raised over the pos­si­ble risks to wear­ing masks while ex­er­cis­ing, but one health ex­pert dis­missed con­cerns over the pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“For low to mod­er­ate ex­er­cise in healthy per­sons, it should not pose too much prob­lem,” said Dr Le­ung Chi Chiu, for­mer chair­man of the Hong Kong Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion’s ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee on com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases.</p>
    <p>“Suit­ably re­duc­ing ex­er­cise in­ten­sity may help those who have prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment last week re­laxed mask-wear­ing at coun­try parks and for ex­er­cis­ing out­doors, but “in sit­u­a­tions where so­cial dis­tanc­ing can­not be met, peo­ple still need to wear masks dur­ing ex­er­cise”, Dr Le­ung said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ni­cholas Thomas from the City Univer­sity of Hong Kong said a more im­por­tant is­sue is hy­giene within the gyms as well as the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed to ex­er­cise at a time.</p>
    <p>“A gym op­er­at­ing at full ca­pac­ity, where masks are be­ing worn, of­fers far more op­por­tu­ni­ties for vi­ral trans­mis­sion than a small ta­ble of din­ers with­out masks,” he said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong, which saw daily case num­bers top 100 as re­cently as a month ago, re­ported eight new virus cases yes­ter­day, all of which were lo­cally trans­mit­ted, with four of them hav­ing an un­known ori­gin.</p>
