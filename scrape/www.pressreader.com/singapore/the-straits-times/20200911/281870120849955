    <p>WASH­ING­TON The United States has re­voked visas for more than 1,000 Chi­nese na­tion­als un­der a pres­i­den­tial mea­sure deny­ing en­try to stu­dents and re­searchers deemed se­cu­rity risks, the State Depart­ment said on Wed­nes­day, a move China called a vi­o­la­tion of hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing also said yes­ter­day that the Aus­tralian Em­bassy in China ob­structed law en­force­ment when it shel­tered two jour­nal­ists who were wanted for ques­tion­ing in China and re­turned to Aus­tralia this week.</p>
    <p>In the US, the act­ing head of the Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity, Mr Chad Wolf, said ear­lier that Wash­ing­ton was block­ing visas “for cer­tain Chi­nese grad­u­ate stu­dents and re­searchers with ties to China’s mil­i­tary fu­sion strat­egy to pre­vent them from steal­ing and oth­er­wise ap­pro­pri­at­ing sen­si­tive re­search”.</p>
    <p>Mr Wolf, in a speech, re­peated</p>
    <p>US charges of un­just busi­ness prac­tices and in­dus­trial es­pi­onage by China, in­clud­ing at­tempts to steal coro­n­avirus re­search data, and ac­cused the Asian gi­ant of abus­ing stu­dent visas to ex­ploit Amer­i­can academia.</p>
    <p>Mr Wolf said the US was also “pre­vent­ing goods pro­duced from slave labour from en­ter­ing our mar­kets, de­mand­ing that China re­spect the in­her­ent dig­nity of each hu­man be­ing”, an ap­par­ent ref­er­ence to ac­cu­sa­tions of abuse of Mus­lim Uighurs in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>A State Depart­ment spokesman said the visa ac­tion fol­lowed a May 29 procla­ma­tion by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump as part of the US re­sponse to China’s curbs on democ­racy in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“As of Tues­day, the depart­ment has re­voked more than 1,000 visas of PRC na­tion­als who were found to be sub­ject to Pres­i­den­tial Procla­ma­tion 10043 and there­fore in­el­i­gi­ble for a visa,” the spokesman said, re­fer­ring to China’s for­mal name, the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>She said the in­el­i­gi­ble “high-risk grad­u­ate stu­dents and re­search schol­ars” were “a small sub­set” of the Chi­nese com­ing to the US for study and re­search, and that le­git­i­mate stu­dents and schol­ars would con­tinue to be wel­comed.</p>
    <p>About 360,000 Chi­nese na­tion­als study in the US, bring­ing its col­leges sig­nif­i­cant rev­enue, though the Covid-19 pan­demic has se­verely dis­rupted their re­turn to cam­pus for this au­tumn se­mes­ter.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing yes­ter­day, a For­eign Min­istry spokesman de­scribed the US move as “naked” po­lit­i­cal per­se­cu­tion and racial dis­crim­i­na­tion that se­ri­ously vi­o­lated hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>Ap­prox­i­mate num­ber of Chi­nese na­tion­als who study in the US and bring col­leges sig­nif­i­cant rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“China re­serves the right to make a fur­ther re­sponse on this is­sue,” Mr Zhao Li­jian told a daily me­dia brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Some Chi­nese stu­dents en­rolled in US uni­ver­si­ties said that they learnt of the can­cel­la­tions in emailed no­tices re­ceived on Wed­nes­day from the US Em­bassy in Bei­jing or con­sulates in China.</p>
    <p>In a WeChat cha­t­room, more than 70 hold­ers of F-1 visas, both post­grad­u­ate and un­der­grad­u­ate stu­dents, said that the no­tices ad­vised them to seek new visas if they wanted to travel to the US.</p>
    <p>Many said that they were ma­jor­ing in sub­jects such as sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics.</p>
    <p>Some said they had re­ceived bach­e­lor’s de­grees from Chi­nese uni­ver­si­ties with links to the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao yes­ter­day also ac­cused the Aus­tralian Em­bassy in China of help­ing Mr Bill Bir­tles and Mr Michael Smith, who work for Aus­tralian me­dia, to leave the coun­try and “avoid China’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion”.</p>
    <p>Their dra­matic flight from China comes as ten­sions be­tween China and Aus­tralia es­ca­lated in re­cent days, with the two sides ac­cus­ing each other of j eop­ar­dis­ing the safety of jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese po­lice last week told Mr Bir­tles, from the Aus­tralian Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion, and Mr Smith, from the Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view, that they were barred from leav­ing the coun­try and were wanted for ques­tion­ing in re­la­tion to the case of Ms Cheng Lei – a Chi­nese-born Aus­tralian an­chor for state-run broad­caster China Global Tele­vi­sion Net­work – who is cur­rently de­tained in China.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao said: “The Aus­tralian Em­bassy in China gave shel­ter to the rel­e­vant jour­nal­ists (al­low­ing them to) avoid China’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion. This was bla­tant ob­struc­tion and in­ter­fer­ence in China’s nor­mal law en­force­ment.”</p>
