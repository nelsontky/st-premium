        Top of theNews | | A7 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 30, 2020 CLAIMS UNDER SCRUTINY AIR OF UNPROFESSI­ONALISM From the very start, there has been scepticism about the BNG bid, and even though I broke the story, I have always had my doubts. There is a real air of unprofessi­onalism about the way they’ve gone about things. Obama photos ’’ In December last year, Novena Global Lifecare, founded by cousins Terence and Nelson Loh, sponsored a charity event at a local hotel attended by former United States president Barack Obama. Ms Evangeline Shen was also present. The Bellagraph Nova (BN) Group released publicity photos that were doctored to make it seem like Mr Obama had met the three in Paris, where the group is supposedly headquarte­red. BRITISH SPORTS WRITER LIAM KENNEDY, who was the first to report the BN Group’s Newcastle bid in the Shields Gazette. NETX THREE-MEMBER BOARD? How can a US$12 billion revenue company with 23,000 employees have a board with just those three people? The BN Group’s presentati­on deck for its Newcastle bid in mid-August lists NETX as one of its entities.
It is described as a “robotics company” that combines “healthcare, AI (artificial intelligen­ce) and robotics” with “a disruptive approach towards technology in order to improve our quality of life and all while being listed on SGX (Singapore Exchange)”.
NETX does not exist yet. The only SGX entity linked to the BN Group is Catalist-listed Axington, which was bought by the cousins last month and whose non-independen­t non-executive chairman is Ms Shen.
On July 29, Axington proposed a name change to NETX, and to change its core business to include robotics and AI. Shareholde­rs were to have voted on this at an extraordin­ary general meeting last Thursday, which has since been postponed. ’’ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ADVOCATE MAK YUEN TEEN, calling on investors to do their due diligence Hydra X OVERSTRETC­HING THE TRUTH When you are trying to court somebody, you want to look the best you can, even though it may not be true. Some people are willing to stretch it. The BN Group says this financial technology firm is one of its entities and is “responsibl­e for designing and implementi­ng the trading system for the SGX”. Reuters reported Hydra X and SGX denying this. Bulgari Hotel Shanghai The group claimed to be working on a “luxurious anti-ageing” clinic to be set up in Bulgari Hotel Shanghai by year-end. Italian luxury brand Bulgari said there is no such facility planned. It also has no contact with the BN Group and any of its related companies. The brand is also looking into how a Novena Bulgari Aesthetics was registered. ’’ PROFESSOR THEMIN SUWARDY, from the Singapore Management University’s School of Accountanc­y, on how the group went overboard in its Newcastle bid Surgery centres Earlier this year, Novena Global Lifecare said it had paid $20 million for a 55 per cent stake in two day surgery centres – Aptus Surgery Centre at Paragon Medical Centre and Novaptus Surgery Centre at Camden Medical Centre.
Dr Lim Beng Hai, chairman of the board of directors of the two centres, told The Sunday Times yesterday that the acquisitio­n did not take place, and that the proposed stake was not $20 million as claimed.
The Business Times also reported that Novena Global Healthcare and Novena Life Sciences, set up in 2016 and 2018 respective­ly, have not filed annual returns since they were incorporat­ed. The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority said enforcemen­t action will be taken against them. REPORTING TEAM IN SINGAPORE: Joyce Lim, Grace Leong, Tham Yuen-C, David Lee, Sazali Abdul Aziz and Sue-Ann Tan Bellagraph jewels IN CHINA: Elizabeth Law in Shanghai and Danson Cheong in Beijing Bellagraph Jewelry says it holds the world record for “the largest single online sales transactio­n across all categories”. This is apparently for selling a red diamond to an “unnamed male collector” for US$102 million last year. No record of this could be found.
Publicity material says Bellagraph Jewelry “is sponsored by the Obama Foundation”, and that during the meeting with Mr Obama, Ms Shen was wearing a “300-carat ruby necklace” by Bellagraph and matching ruby earrings and bracelets.
It claimed that Mr Obama praised the beauty of the “La Rose Bracelet and expressed his great hope that it would be given to his wife Michelle Obama”. Ms Shen “decided on the spot” to gift it to him. Queries to the Obama Foundation went unanswered. they had not heard of Novena Global Lifecare Group until the news about the doctored photo.
But the name Novu Aesthetics, formerly known as PPP Laser Clinic, rang a bell.
PPP Laser Clinic was founded by Dr Goh Seng Heng in 2010. The Loh cousins later became directors, and following disputes with shareholde­rs, Dr Goh quit in 2016. There are six Novu clinics – in Raffles City, Nex, Jurong Point, Bedok Mall, Jem and Northpoint.
Last year, Novena Global Lifecare reportedly merged with Xingkeduo, a chain of hair salons in China, in a touted US$350 million deal.
Xingkeduo bills itself as a tech company and claims to be the first hair salon in China to combine hairdressi­ng with online commerce. It has about 100 stores across cities that specialise in fast, no-frills cuts, much like QB House in Singapore.
A Chinese company listed under the BN Group umbrella has denied links, though.
A person close to the chief executive of Golden Ladies, an upmarket photograph­y studio with over 400 stores, denied that the company had been in contact with anyone from the BN Group. Mak Yuen Teen said it is not unusual for some companies to exaggerate their credential­s and misreprese­nt themselves to investors, or window-dressing.
“I sometimes find directors/ management/major shareholde­rs disclosing false qualificat­ions,” said the National University of Singapore Business School associate professor. “Investors definitely need to do their due diligence.”
Of the BN Group, he said: “How can a US$12 billion revenue company with 23,000 employees have a board with just those three people?”
Mr Francis Chng, director of security firm Horus I, which conducts due diligence checks on companies and individual­s, said it is not unusual for companies to claim they have expertise when they may not necessaril­y have delivered any such service.
It is also quite common for companies to have different brand entities under one holding company, he added, and it would be hard to find and validate the financial informatio­n of private companies.
The fallout from the saga has also affected the public relations, marketing and media industries, who have had to reckon with their part in helping the trio gain legitimacy in the eyes of the public.
The group and founders have been putting out their marketing material on PR Newswire, a company that distribute­s press releases.
As more discrepanc­ies were revealed, the company’s past statements were pulled out online, though many copies still reside on other sites that had published them.
A public relations profession­al who worked with Novena Global for less than a year said PR Newswire has commercial tie-ups that ensure the releases will appear on news aggregator sites.
According to PR Newswire’s terms of use, it “does not guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, integrity, quality, safety, appropriat­eness or any other aspect of any informatio­n or content provided by PR Newswire... We will, however, use reasonable efforts to correct any error of fact, timing or omission brought to our attention”.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the PR practition­er said she had sometimes felt like she was caught between a rock and a hard place working with Novena Global, but “could not turn away business”.
Eventually, the demands to put out unproven claims got too much, and both parties parted ways.
As for the media, publicatio­ns have, over the years, picked up the releases or interviewe­d the two men, sometimes repeating some of the claims that have now turned out to be questionab­le.
Singapore Polytechni­c marketing lecturer Lucas Tok said the saga is a reminder not to repeat claims blindly.
On the legality of the claims, Associate Professor Mak said that if the false claims were used in presentati­ons to get money from investors, it could amount to misreprese­ntation and result in civil claims. If used in regulatory filings, it may even veer into illegal territory.
To him, there is also a lesson here for those who have standing in society to be extremely careful about being used to dress up the boards of companies.
Professor Themin Suwardy from the Singapore Management University’s School of Accountanc­y sees the BN Group as having gone overboard in its Newcastle bid.
“When you are trying to court somebody, you want to look the best you can, even though it may not be true. Some people are willing to stretch it,” he said.
While private companies are not policed as much for their claims, such behaviour could have longlastin­g repercussi­ons for the companies, he added.
And as for the BN Group’s Newcastle bid – which started it all – most are wagering it’s dead in the water.
Mr Kennedy said yesterday: “Newcastle United fans want change – they’re desperate for it – but it has to be for the better. And there is a sense this BNG bid could be a recipe for disaster.
“Mike Ashley is not even entertaini­ng it – and that speaks volumes, given he is so desperate to sell the football club.” Loh Brothers Foundation A website on the foundation named SGX Regulation chief executive Tan Boon Gin as a director. He is not on the board.
The website also said the cousins are patrons of Hong Kah grassroots and among other things, built two PAP Community Foundation (PCF) pre-schools.
The People’s Associatio­n said both men are no longer patrons, and that PCF has no record of donations from them or the foundation towards the building of PCF Sparkletot­s pre-schools in the last five years. Other claims • Former US ambassador to Singapore Kirk Wagar was listed as a board member of the BN Group but he has denied having any role.
• The group also lists “Monica Belluci” as a board member. It is not known if this refers to the famous Italian actress, who did not reply to queries.
• Press releases say the group’s Paris headquarte­rs is in the “renowned No. 10 Place Vendome”. Reuters’ checks led to an office rental business operated by Regus. A staff member said the group has used its space.
• The group claims it had US$12 billion in revenue last year and 23,000 employees. This could not be verified. Corporate transparen­cy joycel@sph.com.sg gleong@sph.com.sg yuenc@sph.com.sg davidlee@sph.com.sg msazali@sph.com.sg suetan@sph.com.sg esmlaw@sph.com.sg dansonc@sph.com.sg The episode has raised questions about corporate governance and transparen­cy, the integrity of marketing and publicity material, and the role of the media in verifying claims.
Corporate governance advocate • An Instagram post said the group has “over 10,000 private jets” for clients. While Dorr Group Private Jet Chartering is listed as an entity, no booking informatio­n was available on the nowdefunct web page.
