    <p>Par­tic­i­pants at­tend­ing the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) in Sin­ga­pore this May will have to abide by strict pub­lic health re­quire­ments, said Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Alvin Tan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These in­clude un­der­go­ing a rig­or­ous Covid-19 test­ing reg­i­men in­volv­ing pre-de­par­ture and onar­rival tests, as well as ad­her­ing to strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“To min­imise the risk of seed­ing lo­cal trans­mis­sions, we will also put in place mea­sures to man­age the in­ter­ac­tions be­tween the lo­cal com­mu­nity and the event at­ten­dees,” Mr Tan said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan was re­spond­ing in Par­lia­ment to Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), who had asked about health re­quire­ments for WEF par­tic­i­pants and con­tin­gency plans should the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion worsen to the ex­tent of re­quir­ing bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said spe­cific pub­lic health re­quire­ments and con­tin­gency plans are cur­rently be­ing worked out, and will take into con­sid­er­a­tion the lat­est sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore and around the world.</p>
    <p>“The health re­quire­ments de­vel­oped for this event could also serve as an im­por­tant ref­er­ence for sub­se­quent events that are go­ing to be held in Sin­ga­pore,” he added.</p>
    <p>Last month, the WEF an­nounced its de­ci­sion to hold the an­nual fo­rum in Sin­ga­pore in­stead of Switzer­land this May, in the light of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Europe.</p>
    <p>The an­nual meet­ing, which gath­ers top po­lit­i­cal, busi­ness and aca­demic lead­ers to dis­cuss press­ing global is­sues, saw about 3,000 par­tic­i­pants gather in Davos, Switzer­land, in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>It will be held in Sin­ga­pore from May 13 to 16 this year, be­fore re­turn­ing to Switzer­land next year.</p>
    <p>The an­nual fo­rum will, in a first, in­clude a vir­tual com­po­nent to al­low for greater par­tic­i­pa­tion dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Yip had also asked about the ex­tent to which Sin­ga­porean tal­ent would be in­volved in or­gan­is­ing the event.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Tan said the Gov­ern­ment has been in­tro­duc­ing in­ter­ested lo­cal firms and ser­vice providers to the WEF and its event or­gan­iser, Publi­cisLive, for po­ten­tial part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>“It will also be a good chance for us to show­case how Sin­ga­pore has made it pos­si­ble through our ef­fort to main­tain ro­bust health pro­to­cols while sus­tain­ing im­por­tant eco­nomic and busi­ness ac­tiv­ity amidst the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>He said the WEF’s in­tent is also for the meet­ing to have a greater fo­cus on Asia, given the re­gion’s grow­ing eco­nomic weight and im­por­tance in the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing for­ward to the op­por­tu­nity for Sin­ga­pore to con­trib­ute to the pro­gramme and the dis­cus­sions at the meet­ing,” added Mr Tan, stress­ing that the coun­try will not let its guard down and will con­tinue work­ing to min­imise the num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions here.</p>
    <p>Mr Yip then asked if there are plans for the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore to be vac­ci­nated be­fore the event. Mr Tan replied that the avail­abil­ity and roll-out of vac­cines here and else­where are still be­ing worked out.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to eval­u­ate the sit­u­a­tion with these roll-out pro­grammes lo­cally as well as glob­ally, and ap­ply the pre­vail­ing con­di­tions to all in­com­ing trav­ellers to Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>To min­imise the risk of seed­ing lo­cal trans­mis­sions, we will also put in place mea­sures to man­age the in­ter­ac­tions be­tween the lo­cal com­mu­nity and the event at­ten­dees.</p>
