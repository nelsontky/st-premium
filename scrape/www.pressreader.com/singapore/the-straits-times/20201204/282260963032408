    <p>Sin­ga­pore needs to raise its au­dit­ing and ac­count­ing stan­dards to boost the na­tion’s en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance (ESG) cred­i­bil­ity fol­low­ing a series of cor­po­rate scan­dals, ac­cord­ing to the coun­try’s top cen­tral banker.</p>
    <p>“There have been sev­eral fail­ures that are due to lapses in ac­count­ing, au­dit­ing and some fraud­u­lent ac­tiv­i­ties are not as easily de­tected,” said Mr Ravi Menon, head of the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS). “It is an area that needs to be ad­dressed.”</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s cor­po­rate dis­clo­sure level im­proved this year, it lags be­hind neigh­bour­ing coun­tries such as Malaysia and Thai­land, ac­cord­ing to a re­port pub­lished in Oc­to­ber by the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>Com­pli­ance around ESG stan­dards is be­com­ing an ex­is­ten­tial ques­tion for firms as sus­tain­able in­vest­ing as­sets swell to more than US$30 tril­lion (S$40 tril­lion), ac­cord­ing to a re­port by the Global Sus­tain­able In­vest­ment Al­liance.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had its share of high-pro­file cor­po­rate scan­dals in re­cent years. Hyflux, a wa­ter-treat­ment firm, owes about $2.8 bil­lion to some 34,000 re­tail in­vestors and banks, while com­mod­ity trader No­ble Group Hold­ings re­mains un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties for its ac­count­ing prac­tices. Mean­while, oil trader Hin Leong Trad­ing faces forgery charges and ac­cu­sa­tions of hid­ing losses.</p>
    <p>“When an au­di­tor says this is in line with ac­count­ing stan­dards, there is still a fairly wide range of what is ac­cept­able,” Mr Menon said, re­fer­ring to the recog­ni­tion in many places that au­dit qual­ity needs to be raised. “Get­ting more pre­ci­sion has been quite a chal­lenge.”</p>
    <p>The city state has “pretty strict rules” on cor­po­rate gov­er­nance re­quire­ments, in­clud­ing a min­i­mum num­ber of in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors, dis­clo­sure, and sep­a­ra­tion of man­age­ment and own­er­ship, all of which have be­come “quite in­grained”, Mr Menon said.</p>
    <p>The Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity is work­ing on amendments to the Com­pa­nies Act to re­view is­sues in­clud­ing cur­rent com­pany types and fi­nan­cial re­port­ing as well as safe­guard­ing share­hold­ers’ in­ter­ests. The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s reg­u­la­tory arm is also set to beef up its en­force­ment pow­ers to de­ter cor­po­rate mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also striv­ing to be­come a green fi­nance hub. Last month, MAS un­veiled a grant pro­gramme aimed at boost­ing ac­cess to green and sus­tain­abil­ity-linked loans. This is on top of in­cen­tives in­tro­duced in June 2017 to help with ex­ter­nal-re­view ex­penses for is­suers of green bonds.</p>
    <p>More than $6.5 bil­lion of green bonds have been is­sued in Sin­ga­pore since the in­cen­tive was launched, ac­cord­ing to MAS data from March.</p>
    <p>The amount of green bonds is­sued in Sin­ga­pore this year has al­most tripled to US$1 bil­lion, from US$341.8 mil­lion last year, ac­cord­ing to data tracked by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank is work­ing with rat­ings firms and ex­perts in cer­ti­fi­ca­tion to en­sure com­pa­nies rais­ing money from green fi­nanc­ing stick to their sus­tain­abil­ity pledges, the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor said.</p>
    <p>“It is quite frus­trat­ing that there is no com­mon un­der­stand­ing of what con­sti­tutes a green prod­uct or a green process,” said the MAS chief, adding that ef­forts are un­der way for some de­gree of con­sis­tency. “I think we will get at least re­gional stan­dards that are con­sis­tent across re­gions, not ex­actly iden­ti­cal, but tak­ing into ac­count re­gional pe­cu­liar­i­ties and cir­cum­stances.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is build­ing up ex­per­tise in ver­i­fi­ca­tion and cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­cesses to en­sure it meets “re­spectable global stan­dards” that may lead to more jobs in this area, he said.</p>
    <p>“We need to build a whole ecosys­tem for green fi­nance,” Mr Menon said.</p>
    <p>AIM­ING FOR CON­SIS­TENCY</p>
    <p>I think we will get at least re­gional stan­dards that are con­sis­tent across re­gions, not ex­actly iden­ti­cal, but tak­ing into ac­count re­gional pe­cu­liar­i­ties and cir­cum­stances. ’’</p>
    <p>MR RAVI MENON, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, on green fi­nanc­ing.</p>
