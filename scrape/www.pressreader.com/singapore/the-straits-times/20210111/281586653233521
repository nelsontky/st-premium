    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s e-sports in­dus­try has grown tremen­dously in re­cent years but still trails be­hind re­gional pow­er­houses such as China and South Korea, say ob­servers. While a few lo­cal play­ers have made their mark glob­ally and there is more prize money, gam­ing is not yet part of main­stream cul­ture and the am­a­teur scene is not strong.</p>
    <p>When Alaric Choo was com­pet­ing in real-time strat­egy game Star­craft II semi-pro­fes­sion­ally eight years ago, there was lit­tle to play for. Back then, op­por­tu­ni­ties to make a liv­ing from e-sports were scarce. Spon­sor­ships of­ten came in the form of prod­ucts such as a gam­ing mouse or key­board in ex­change for hav­ing the spon­sor’s logo on the ath­letes’ at­tire.</p>
    <p>Since then, the e-sports in­dus­try has grown rapidly, with in­ter­na­tional tour­na­ments boast­ing prize pots worth sev­eral mil­lions, while mar­ket re­search firm New­zoo es­ti­mated that the global e-sports au­di­ence will grow to 495 mil­lion peo­ple last year – an 11.7 per cent in­crease from 2019.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has pro­duced sev­eral e-sports ath­letes who have made their mark on a global stage, in­clud­ing Dota 2 player Daryl “ice­i­ce­ice” Koh, whose to­tal earn­ings from tour­na­ments ex­ceed $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, three Sin­ga­pore­ans – Charleston “Scythe” Yeo, Jerome “Re­sponse” Kwek and Ni­cholas “CoupDeAce” Wil­son Ng – were part of the Paris Saint-Ger­main e-sports team of four who clinched the Brawl Stars World Fi­nals and won US$200,000 (S$265,184).</p>
    <p>With more e-sports or­gan­i­sa­tions be­ing set up here and the back­ing of gov­ern­ment agen­cies for var­i­ous e-sports ini­tia­tives, the num­ber of op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cal play­ers have also in­creased.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, two lo­cal teams will com­pete at the Jan 18-24 M2 World Cham­pi­onship at ShangriLa Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore for game ti­tle Mo­bile Leg­ends: Bang Bang. The event, which has a prize pool of US$300,000, is sup­ported by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB).</p>
    <p>Choo, who is the co-founder of gam­ing chair man­u­fac­turer Se­cretLab, said: “You will see the scene has grown – wel­fare is much higher and I think that with or­gan­i­sa­tions like this com­ing up, it’s def­i­nitely a step in the right di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>BRIDG­ING THE GAP</p>
    <p>While the emer­gence of var­i­ous es­ports or­gan­i­sa­tions and gov­ern­ment back­ing are seen as en­cour­ag­ing signs, some feel that Sin­ga­pore’s e-sports land­scape still lags be­hind those in Asia such as pow­er­houses South Korea and China.</p>
    <p>Com­pared to these two coun­tries, Sin­ga­pore still has some way to go to po­si­tion it­self as a des­ti­na­tion for ma­jor tour­na­ments. South Korea and China have hosted many pres­ti­gious events such as the League of Leg­ends World Cham­pi­onship. The 2018 World Cham­pi­onship held across South Korea – Seoul, Bu­san, Gwangju, and In­cheon – had a prize pool of over US$6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, one of the big­gest events held here was the One Es­ports Dota 2 Sin­ga­pore World Pro In­vi­ta­tional in De­cem­ber 2019, when 12 of the world’s best teams bat­tled for a share of the US$500,000 prize pool. The</p>
    <p>US$1 mil­lion Dota 2 Sin­ga­pore Ma­jor by One Es­ports was sup­posed to take place here last June, but the off­line event could not be held ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a clear path­way for tal­ented play­ers to progress so that they see e-sports as a vi­able ca­reer is also some­thing that many feel Sin­ga­pore can im­prove on.</p>
    <p>South Korea, of­ten seen as an es­ports pi­o­neer, boasts one of the top e-sports ecosys­tems in the world, which has pro­duced mul­ti­ple world cham­pi­ons in game ti­tles such as League of Leg­ends and The In­ter­na­tional, an an­nual Dota 2 world cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Since the first sea­son of the League of Leg­ends World Cham­pi­onship, six ti­tles have gone to teams from South Korea, while Chi­nese teams have claimed two.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an es­ti­mate by New­zoo, China has the largest e-sports mar­ket by rev­enue at US$385.1 mil­lion. In a bid to re­main a leader in e-sports, Shang­hai has be­gun con­struc­tion of the US$898 mil­lion Shang­hai In­ter­na­tional New Cul­tural and Cre­ative E-sports Cen­tre, an arena where teams and com­pa­nies can be based and com­pete.</p>
    <p>Zu­ber Mo­hammed, chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer of Sin­ga­porean-Amer­i­can gam­ing com­pany Razer, be­lieves that more co­he­sive­ness will help the lo­cal scene.</p>
    <p>He said: “This in­cludes unit­ing fed­er­a­tions and agen­cies to­gether as one for the bet­ter­ment of the in­dus­try... With­out a sin­gle ob­jec­tive, there will be ei­ther over­lap­ping re­sources or there could be a frag­mented ap­proach.”</p>
    <p>CUL­TURAL DIF­FER­ENCES</p>
    <p>One of the main dif­fer­ences be­tween Sin­ga­pore and top coun­tries in the re­gion is that gam­ing is not wo­ven into its cul­ture.</p>
    <p>In South Korea, youth spend hours at PC Bangs – gam­ing cafes where pa­trons can pay an hourly rate to use fa­cil­i­ties – that are scat­tered across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Last year, China recog­nised es­ports pro­fes­sion­als and e-sports op­er­a­tors as of­fi­cial job ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Choo said: “The Korean gam­ing scene was very, very de­vel­oped (eight years ago) so they are leaps and bounds ahead of us, but it’s part of the cul­ture as well. For us, it’s still some­thing that’s very un­heard of, from a cul­tural per­spec­tive to be do­ing gam­ing full-time.”</p>
    <p>One of Sin­ga­pore’s best e-sports ath­letes, Ho Kun Xian, 30, be­lieves that the per­cep­tion to­wards es­ports here has im­proved since he picked up fight­ing games over two decades ago. Back then, mak­ing a ca­reer out of play­ing games such as Street Fighter was not a thought that crossed his mind.</p>
    <p>Ho, who won the 2013 Evo­lu­tion Cham­pi­onship Se­ries Su­per Street Fighter IV, said: “Sin­ga­pore has grown a lot since I started gam­ing when there was no such job as a pro­fes­sional gamer. It was just a hobby so we did it be­cause we re­ally liked it. Now, there are a lot of dif­fer­ent paths avail­able for it – you can do things like com­men­tate, be a con­tent cre­ator, and</p>
    <p>Now, there are a lot of dif­fer­ent paths avail­able for it – you can do things like com­men­tate, be a con­tent cre­ator, and that’s how you know it’s come a re­ally long</p>
    <p>HO KUN XIAN, one of Sin­ga­pore’s best e-sports ath­letes, on how the in­dus­try has trans­formed.</p>
    <p>EM­BED­DED IN CUL­TURE</p>
    <p>The Korean gam­ing scene was very, very de­vel­oped (eight years ago) so they are leaps and bounds ahead of us, but it’s part of the cul­ture as well. For us, it’s still some­thing that’s very un­heard of, from a cul­tural per­spec­tive to be</p>
    <p>that’s how you know it’s come a re­ally long way.”</p>
    <p>BUILD­ING THE AM­A­TEUR SCENE</p>
    <p>Zu­ber be­lieves de­vel­op­ing the am­a­teur gam­ing land­scape is key.</p>
    <p>He said: “Since the early days, es­ports was seen as just a mar­ket­ing tool for the game pub­lish­ers. Now, the au­di­ences have grown tremen­dously over time. I think as of now, we are close to 500 mil­lion world­wide and the e-sports in­dus­try is seen as a pro­fes­sional and le­git­i­mate spot. But this has re­sulted in sev­eral draw­backs. If the ath­lete is not part of a pro­fes­sional team, it is hard to gain ac­cess to the in­dus­try – it is no longer in­clu­sive.”</p>
    <p>This was what led to the com­pany launch­ing the Razer SEA In­vi­ta­tional from June 26 to July 12, which saw over 500 teams from 10 coun­tries in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Ob­serv­ing that there was a mar­ket be­yond the pro­fes­sional es­ports cir­cuits, global me­dia net­work and tour­na­ment plat­form, Es­ports Play­ers League (ESPL), which is head­quar­tered in Sin­ga­pore, was founded in Au­gust 2019.</p>

    <p>LEV­ER­AG­ING ON E-SPORTS’ GROWTH DUR­ING THE PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic see­ing many around the world con­fined to their homes be­cause of lock­downs, more have turned to e-sports.</p>
    <p>Lawrence Chan, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of In­ter­net ser­vice provider MyRepub­lic Sin­ga­pore, be­lieves that this bodes well for the lo­cal es­ports scene.</p>
    <p>He said: “While Sin­ga­pore is lo­cated right in the re­gion where es­ports was first pop­u­larised and con­tin­ues to grow ex­po­nen­tially, re­cep­tive­ness to the in­dus­try has been some­what luke­warm as com­pared to pioneers such as South Korea, up un­til re­cently – and fur­ther ac­cel­er­ated with the on­set of the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Apart from cre­at­ing a broad­band for gamers, MyRepub­lic has also or­gan­ised sev­eral re­gional e-sports tour­na­ments. The growth of the es­ports in­dus­try has also cre­ated new job types such as com­mu­nity man­agers for games and tour­na­ment pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>Last Au­gust, trade as­so­ci­a­tion for the gam­ing and e-sports in­dus­try, the Sin­ga­pore Games As­so­ci­a­tion (SGGA), which is sup­ported by gov­ern­ment agen­cies En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity and STB, was launched.</p>
    <p>SGGA vice-chair­man Eli­cia Lee shared that the as­so­ci­a­tion in­tends to as­sist those look­ing to en­ter the in­dus­try through ini­tia­tives such as its SGGA In­dus­try Day, which pro­vides in­for­ma­tion about the in­dus­try and what it takes to have a ca­reer in e-sports.</p>
    <p>Lee said: “We in­tend to train and cre­ate aware­ness of the op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able across a wide spec­trum within the e-sports in­dus­try.”</p>
