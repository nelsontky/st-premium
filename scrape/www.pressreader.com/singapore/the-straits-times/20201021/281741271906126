    <p>Sin­ga­pore Expo & Max Atria has had its first in-per­son Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions) event since the space was re­pur­posed as a com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The open­ing cer­e­mony of the third In­dus­trial Trans­for­ma­tion Asia-Pa­cific (ITAP) event, the re­gion’s go-to plat­form for ex­plor­ing In­dus­try 4.0 so­lu­tions, was a hy­brid one yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A small group of 100 at­ten­dees sat 1m apart from one an­other, while some 5,000 other par­tic­i­pants from 50 coun­tries watched the event on­line.</p>
    <p>End­ing to­mor­row, ITAP has gone hy­brid for the first time, with vir­tual ac­tiv­i­ties and live-streamed events be­ing held on a plat­form pow­ered by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence. It is also work­ing with other ex­hibitors to con­duct in-per­son ac­tiv­i­ties held at other lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>ITAP is one of the events sig­nalling the safe restart of Sin­ga­pore’s busi­ness events in­dus­try, with hy­bridi­s­a­tion and re­in­forced safe event man­age­ment mea­sures in place, event or­gan­iser SingEx said.</p>
    <p>At yes­ter­day’s open­ing cer­e­mony, at­ten­dees were di­vided into zones of at most 50 peo­ple, with par­tic­i­pants in each zone fur­ther sep­a­rated into groups of 10 or 20. Peo­ple were not al­lowed to min­gle across groups, with var­i­ous di­viders de­mar­cat­ing ar­eas for each. Ev­ery group had a des­ig­nated en­trance. Stag­gered tim­ings for ar­rival and de­par­ture for each group were also im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing lunch, each group was fur­ther di­vided into sec­tions of five at most and par­tic­i­pants were given in­di­vid­u­ally packed meals, with food pref­er­ences se­lected from a dig­i­tal menu.</p>
    <p>While the open­ing cer­e­mony was at­tended by a live stu­dio au­di­ence, it was also broad­cast on Web plat­form ITAP Con­nected, which was de­signed by SingEx.</p>
    <p>The plat­form al­lows event par­tic­i­pants to find con­tent per­son­alised to their pref­er­ences, seek out net­work­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and even ex­plore a 3D Smart Fac­tory.</p>
    <p>They can also at­tend phys­i­cal bolt-on ac­tiv­i­ties, such as small en­gage­ment tours to lo­ca­tions in Sin­ga­pore that show­case in­dus­trial trans­for­ma­tion and how In­dus­try 4.0 con­cepts can be de­ployed. The in-per­son ac­tiv­i­ties wi l l be streamed con­cur­rently for vir­tual par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>SingEx said: “With Covid-19 ac­cel­er­at­ing the pace at which event for­mats must con­tin­u­ally evolve to meet cus­tomers’ needs, in­dus­try stake­hold­ers’ con­tin­ued par­tic­i­pa­tion in trade events like ITAP can­not be taken for granted.”</p>
    <p>Mr James Boey, SingEx events busi­ness ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor, said: “(The event) is all about con­nect­ing peo­ple, busi­nesses and ideas, and the chal­lenges from Covid-19 brought (about) im­mense op­por­tu­ni­ties to re­de­fine the fu­ture of how we en­gage with one an­other, pro­vid­ing rich ob­ser­va­tions, learn­ing and in­sights for in­dus­tries as they build re­silience or pivot to sur­vive and thrive.”</p>
    <p>He added that SingEx worked with part­ners to make sure that the Max Atria is safe to use, with high­grade fil­tra­tion sys­tems in the air­con­di­tion­ing to en­sure par­tic­i­pants get fresh air and fa­cil­i­ties like es­ca­la­tors fre­quently sani­tised.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant be­cause we want to make sure that we give con­fi­dence to all par­tic­i­pants and or­gan­is­ers that the Max Atria is in­deed a very safe en­vi­ron­ment, a very safe prop­erty for par­tic­i­pants to come back again and do busi­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gra­ham Con­lon, head of dig­i­tal sup­ply chain for SAP Asia Pa­cific and Ja­pan, one of the ex­hibitors, said: “One of the key ben­e­fits of a hy­brid event is that it en­ables more peo­ple to at­tend and ac­cess the con­tent, hear from in­dus­try ex­perts and ‘ex­pe­ri­ence’ the tech­nol­ogy. With on­line ses­sions recorded, del­e­gates also have the abil­ity to lis­ten to in­ter­est­ing tracks again at a time which suits their sched­ule.”</p>
