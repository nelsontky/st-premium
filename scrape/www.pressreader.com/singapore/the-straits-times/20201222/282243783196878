    <p>A re­cent move to al­low the re­turn of ex­ist­ing work pass hold­ers as well as en­try into Sin­ga­pore for new work pass hold­ers has been cheered by a be­lea­guered con­struc­tion sec­tor that has been squeezed by a labour crunch due to tighter border con­trols amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Con­trac­tors As­so­ci­a­tion Lim­ited (Scal) last Fri­day wel­comed the eas­ing of mea­sures – which kicked i n ear­lier this month – by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>The min­istry, which had ear­lier lim­ited en­try ap­provals for work pass hold­ers to re­duce the risk of im­ported Covid-19 cases, is now pro­cess­ing ap­pli­ca­tions from all ap­proved source coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing work pass hold­ers are now also be­ing al­lowed to re­turn.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has about 1.3 mil­lion for­eign work­ers, of whom some 300,000 work in the con­struc­tion sec­tor.</p>
    <p>About 10 per cent to 15 per cent of con­struc­tion work­ers had re­turned home amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With the travel re­stric­tions, it was dif­fi­cult to find new work­ers to re­place them, said Scal.</p>
    <p>Con­trac­tors were se­verely im­pacted as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Said a Scal spokesman: “Many ex­ist­ing projects and some new projects are fac­ing acute worker short­age. As the de­mand for work­ers out­strips sup­ply, poach­ing of work­ers among sub­con­trac­tors is ram­pant and this has re­sulted in work­ers de­mand­ing higher wages.</p>
    <p>“The in­crease in wages not only im­pacts costs but also af­fects pro­duc­tiv­ity. With this re­cent an­nounce­ment, we hope that the labour crunch is­sues can be re­solved quickly.”</p>
    <p>Mr V. Man­i­maran, op­er­a­tions man­ager of Wee Ch­wee Huat Scaf­fold­ing and Con­struc­tion, said his firm has ap­plied to MOM for in­prin­ci­ple ap­proval (IPA) let­ters for five work­ers from In­dia and Bangladesh, two of whom used to work for the com­pany but whose work passes have since ex­pired.</p>
    <p>The let­ters have to be pro­duced in order for the em­ployer to bring in the work­ers.</p>
    <p>So far, an IPA has al­ready been is­sued for one worker. Mr Man­i­maran’s firm is hop­ing to bring in at least 20 more from abroad.</p>
    <p>He said the an­nounce­ment is timely as his firm has seen 18 of its 120 work­ers re­turn home or trans­fer to other firms since March.</p>
    <p>While the firm still has a sub­stan­tial num­ber of work­ers, it is play­ing catch-up now as con­struc­tion work had to be halted for at least two months dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tiv­ity has also dropped, due to the need to have safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place at work sites.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully some nor­mal­ity will re­turn to the in­dus­try,” said Mr Man­i­maran.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many are adopt­ing a wait-and-see ap­proach be­fore seek­ing ap­proval to bring in more work­ers, cit­ing high costs as well as un­cer­tainty over how Covid-19 mea­sures will af­fect work­ers’ pas­sage into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ment agent Wil­liam Tan, di­rec­tor of the For­eign Re­cruit­ment Cen­tre, said he has re­ceived hun­dreds of in­quiries from em­ploy­ers about bring­ing in more mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>But they are still de­terred by the need to pay $2,000 for each worker who is re­quired to serve his stay-home no­tice (SHN) in a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity af­ter he ar­rives here.</p>
    <p>MOM had said all new or re­turn­ing work per­mit and S Pass hold­ers must com­ply with pre­vail­ing border mea­sures, such as ob­tain­ing en­try ap­provals from the rel­e­vant gov­ern­ment agen­cies, un­der­go­ing pre-de­par­ture tests in their home coun­try and be­ing sub­ject to the SHN upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr David Ng, chair­man of build­ing main­te­nance firm ISOTeam, said he has re­ceived ap­provals for 15 new and ex­ist­ing work­ers from In­dia and Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>But he is con­cerned about the cost of med­i­cal treat­ment if a worker tests pos­i­tive for Covid-19 dur­ing the SHN pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Ng: “It seems that in­surance com­pa­nies are re­luc­tant to un­der­write such in­surance. This is de­spite news of such poli­cies cost­ing less than $100 per worker.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers would have to bear the cost of treat­ment if Covid-19 in­surance is not pur­chased, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Eddy Lau, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Spe­cial­ists Trade Al­liance of Sin­ga­pore, which rep­re­sents spe­cial­ist con­trac­tors and sup­pli­ers in build­ing and con­struc­tion, said the as­so­ci­a­tion is in talks with the au­thor­i­ties to look at how the cost of the SHN can be re­duced.</p>
    <p>One sug­ges­tion is to house work­ers in more af­ford­able ac­com­mo­da­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>Still, em­ploy­ers are also cog­nisant of the need to en­sure that strict pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures are in place, said Mr Lau.</p>
    <p>“We can’t af­ford to have an­other big wave of in­fec­tions – this is some­thing that we all agree on.”</p>
