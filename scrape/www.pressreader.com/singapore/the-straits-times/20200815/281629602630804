    <p>More than 20,000 work­ers have been matched with new roles amid the Covid-19 cri­sis by the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) Job Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, said labour chief Ng Chee Meng.</p>
    <p>This is about dou­ble the num­ber matched by early June.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil, set up in Fe­bru­ary, helps dis­placed work­ers or those at risk of los­ing their jobs move into new jobs or tem­po­rary sec­ond­ments in firms in the group.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of com­pa­nies on board the coun­cil has also risen to more than 9,000, said Mr Ng, up from the more than 7,000 com­pa­nies on board in June, when he gave an up­date in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“In such cir­cum­stances, I sup­pose one can have two dif­fer­ent views, that it has grown so fast be­cause of the cri­sis. I am not re­ally too de­lighted about it, but I am also quite happy we are able to val­ueadd to the job match­ing scene in Sin­ga­pore to help dis­placed work­ers,” Mr Ng, who is NTUC sec­re­tary-gen­eral, said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>His com­ments came after Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said ear­lier this month that the National</p>
    <p>Wages Coun­cil (NWC) would meet for a sec­ond time this year. Yes­ter­day, the min­istry an­nounced that the NWC will re­con­vene later this month and aims to re­lease up­dated guide­lines by next month.</p>
    <p>Speaking to ST at the NTUC Cen­tre, in the un­usu­ally quiet Cen­tral Busi­ness District, Mr Ng said he hopes the coun­cil will look at how to max­imise job preser­va­tion and, at the same time, look after the wel­fare of work­ers, es­pe­cially those earn­ing low wages.</p>
    <p>Based on feed­back, he ex­pects job losses to con­tinue to rise in the next six to 12 months as the eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic be­comes more widely felt.</p>
    <p>NTUC’s pri­or­ity hence is to pre­serve jobs, pro­tect work­ers and, in re­trench­ments, pro­vide care and sup­port to work­ers, like through job match­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>FAIR RE­TRENCH­MENT FRAME­WORK</p>
    <p>Lay­offs, if nec­es­sary, must be done fairly, which is why NTUC pro­posed a Fair Re­trench­ment Frame­work last month, said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>Among other things, it pro­tects the Sin­ga­porean core of the work­force, while for­eign­ers with crit­i­cal skills could be re­tained as well.</p>
    <p>The frame­work had been months in the mak­ing but was an­nounced amid tense union ne­go­ti­a­tions with air­craft main­te­nance com­pany Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia, which was plan­ning to carry out a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise un­fairly.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng had au­tho­rised three unions to con­duct se­cret bal­lots among work­ers on whether to pur­sue le­gal in­dus­trial ac­tion.</p>
    <p>If a le­gal strike had taken place, it would have been the first since the Hy­dril strike of 1986. In the end, in­dus­trial ac­tion was averted after an agree­ment was reached.</p>
    <p>“My goal (in giv­ing the unions the green light) was not to thump my chest and flex our mus­cles, but to have an am­i­ca­ble so­lu­tion in this very dif­fi­cult and chal­leng­ing time for the com­pany and the work­ers,” said Mr Ng, adding that in­dus­trial ac­tion is al­ways a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>This is in line with the tri­par­tite ap­proach in Sin­ga­pore, where the aim of the part­ner­ship be­tween unions, em­ploy­ers and the Gov­ern­ment is to help busi­nesses suc­ceed so that work­ers can have sus­tain­able wage growth, bet­ter wel­fare and bet­ter work prospects, he said.</p>
    <p>“But when com­pa­nies for what­ever rea­sons take on un­fair prac­tices against our work­ers, then the NTUC will stand up to make sure the fun­da­men­tal in­ter­est of work­ers is pro­tected,” he said.</p>
    <p>COM­PE­TI­TION FOR JOBS</p>
    <p>Mr Ng also noted that the over­all level of anx­i­ety among Sin­ga­pore­ans over for­eign­ers work­ing here has height­ened, and sug­gested that Em­ploy­ment Pass poli­cies may need to be tight­ened.</p>
    <p>He said at the macro level, build­ing Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is for Sin­ga­pore­ans’ in­ter­ests, and for­eign­ers are needed in num­bers as well as in tal­ent or skills to aug­ment the lo­cal work­force to ex­pand the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But when there is in­tense com­pe­ti­tion for jobs at cer­tain lev­els, the Gov­ern­ment should put in poli­cies for Sin­ga­pore­ans to have fair ac­cess to good jobs, he said.</p>
    <p>It is a “never-end­ing process” of ad­just­ing poli­cies to each phase of the na­tion’s de­vel­op­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>The changes be­gan ini­tially with the work per­mit pol­icy and then the mid-skilled S Pass work­ers, he noted.</p>
    <p>The next step could be to look at pos­si­bil­i­ties for Em­ploy­ment Passes, “with a very fine bal­ance be­tween the num­bers that are com­ing in, and also at­tract­ing the top tal­ents into Sin­ga­pore”, he added.</p>
    <p>Last week, NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay called on the au­thor­i­ties to dis­close the names of com­pa­nies on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch list, after the Man­power Min­istry said it had re­cently added 47 more em­ploy­ers for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices, on top of an ear­lier 1,200.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said nam­ing the em­ploy­ers would be use­ful – not to shame them but to boost the trans­parency of the hir­ing ecosys­tem and show job seek­ers which em­ploy­ers are good.</p>
    <p>He un­der­stands the anx­i­eties and frus­tra­tions among Sin­ga­pore­ans com­pet­ing for a good job amid a down­turn, he said.</p>
    <p>“But we must also un­der­stand that Sin­ga­pore is a very open econ­omy. We need the link­ages, the net­works and the tal­ents that would cre­ate and an­chor Sin­ga­pore as an in­ter­na­tional hub, where we are busi­ness-friendly, where we wel­come di­ver­sity of peo­ple into the econ­omy to cre­ate the big­gest pos­si­ble space in our na­tion state so that we can uplift Sin­ga­pore­ans’ lives.</p>
    <p>“That bal­ance is the most chal­leng­ing one in cur­rent cir­cum­stances, but nev­er­the­less a crit­i­cal one we as Sin­ga­pore­ans must think about.”</p>
