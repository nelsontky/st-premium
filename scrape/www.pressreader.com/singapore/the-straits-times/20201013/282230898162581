    <p>PARIS • In a year of change, one thing has re­mained con­stant – Rafael Nadal lift­ing the Mus­ke­teers’ Cup aloft at Roland Gar­ros.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard’s record-ex­tend­ing 13th French Open win – no other player has had more than eight vic­to­ries at a sin­gle Grand Slam in the Open era – was on Sun­day hailed by long-time ri­val Roger Fed­erer.</p>
    <p>On Nadal match­ing his all-time record of 20 Ma­jor ti­tles, the Swiss leg­end, who in June an­nounced he would be sit­ting out the rest of the year be­cause of knee surgery, tweeted: “I have al­ways had the ut­most re­spect for my friend Rafa as a per­son and a cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“As my great­est ri­val over many years, I be­lieve we have pushed each other to be­come bet­ter play­ers. There­fore it is a true hon­our for me to con­grat­u­late him on his 20th Grand Slam vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“It is es­pe­cially amaz­ing he has won Roland Gar­ros an in­cred­i­ble 13 times, which is one of the great­est achieve­ments in sport. I hope the 20 is just an­other step on the con­tin­u­ing jour­ney for both of us.”</p>
    <p>Nadal re­turned the com­pli­ments, say­ing: “I think he’s happy when I’m win­ning and I’m happy when he’s do­ing the things well.</p>
    <p>“It means a lot, the pos­i­tive re­la­tion­ship that we have to­gether be­cause we have been go­ing through a great ri­valry for a very, very long time.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the world No. 2 is not ob­sessed with end­ing his ca­reer as the all-time great­est Slam win­ner.</p>
    <p>“I would love to fin­ish my ca­reer be­ing the player with more Slams,” the 34-year-old, who is the old­est Roland Gar­ros cham­pion since An­dres Gi­meno in 1972, said af­ter win­ning his 100th match against just two losses in 15 years here.</p>
    <p>“But I’m not go­ing to be think­ing all the time No­vak (Djokovic) has this one, Roger is win­ning the other one. You can’t be al­ways un­happy be­cause your neigh­bour has a big­ger house than you or a big­ger boat or has a bet­ter phone.</p>
    <p>“In terms of these records, of course I care. For me, it means a lot to share this num­ber with Roger.</p>
    <p>“But let’s see what’s go­ing on when we fin­ish our ca­reers. We keep play­ing. I don’t know what can hap­pen in the future.”</p>
    <p>For Djokovic, he may look back on these last months as some of the most dread­ful in his ca­reer, a se­ries of moments that ap­peared to be filled with op­por­tu­nity but fiz­zled out in spec­tac­u­lar fash­ion.</p>
    <p>There is no shame in los­ing to Nadal at Roland Gar­ros, al­though the Serb should have been more com­pet­i­tive as the slower, heav­ier ball, cool weather and closed roof were all sup­posed ad­van­tages.</p>
    <p>But like so many other times in this strange year, it all went south so quickly for Djokovic, who un­til Sun­day had not lost a com­pet­i­tive match he had com­pleted this year.</p>
    <p>“I was not so pleased,” the world No. 1 said of the way things turned out.</p>
    <p>That is the way things have gone for some months now for Djokovic, ever since he started the year with vic­tory at the Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>What looked like an­other year of dom­i­nance came to a halt in March when the coro­n­avirus pan­demic forced ten­nis to shut down for five months.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the break, Djokovic in­vited con­tro­versy af­ter post­ing a se­ries of bizarre con­ver­sa­tions with his friend, New Age guru Chervin Ja­farieh, in­clud­ing one about how the hu­man body can make pol­luted water healthy through prayer and be­lief.</p>
    <p>In June, the 33-year-old be­gan the Adria Tour, only for the ex­hi­bi­tion to be­come a su­per-spreader event that was pre­ma­turely can­celled af­ter he and sev­eral other play­ers were in­fected by Covid-19, re­sult­ing in sig­nif­i­cant back­lash.</p>
    <p>With his game on cruise con­trol at the US Open last month with his main ri­vals ab­sent, Djokovic lost his tem­per and swat­ted a ball that hit a line judge in the throat.</p>
    <p>Tour­na­ment of­fi­cials, bound by the rules, dis­qual­i­fied him.</p>
    <p>Then came Sun­day in Paris.</p>
    <p>The key for Djokovic mov­ing for­ward will be whether he can limit his un­forced er­rors, both on the court and off it.</p>
    <p>“I have my flaws, as any­body else. In the great­est de­feats, you learn the great­est lessons, as a ten­nis player and a per­son as well,” he said. “If I thought it was too late (to catch Nadal and Fed­erer), I would have ended my ca­reer to­day. My goals re­main the same – the his­toric No. 1 rank­ing and Slam ti­tles.”</p>
    <p>You can’t be al­ways un­happy be­cause your neigh­bour has a big­ger house than you or a big­ger boat or has a bet­ter phone.</p>
