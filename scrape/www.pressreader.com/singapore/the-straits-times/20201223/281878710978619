    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • For­mer Malaysian fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng has pleaded not guilty to two amended charges of cor­rup­tion in­volv­ing the Pe­nang un­der­sea tun­nel project. The graft trial is set to be­gin on June 8 next year.</p>
    <p>Lim, 60, is charged with re­ceiv­ing RM3.3 mil­lion (S$1.1 mil­lion) as an in­duce­ment to help a com­pany se­cure the project, val­ued at RM6.3 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>He is al­leged to have re­ceived the bribe in his ca­pac­ity as the then Chief Min­is­ter of Pe­nang at his of­fice in the Kom­tar build­ing in Ge­orge Town, Pe­nang, between Jan­uary 2011 and Au­gust 2017.</p>
    <p>A clause in the charge sheet, which states that he had a di­rect stake i n the un­der­sea tun­nel project, was re­moved.</p>
    <p>Lim is also charged with so­lic­it­ing 10 per cent of the profit from the com­pany’s di­rec­tor, Datuk Zarul Ah­mad Mohd Zulk­i­fli, for help­ing it to se­cure the project.</p>
    <p>The amend­ment added a time­frame to the ac­cu­sa­tion, stat­ing that it oc­curred between 12.30am and 2am near The Gar­dens Ho­tel at Lingkaran Syed Pu­tra, Mid Val­ley City, in Kuala Lumpur. No date was added, with the charge sheet stat­ing only March 2011.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing case man­age­ment yes­ter­day, deputy pub­lic prose­cu­tor Wan Sha­harud­din Wan Ladin said the pros­e­cu­tion would be call­ing 80 to 90 wit­nesses for the trial.</p>
    <p>Lim’s lawyer Gobind Singh Deo ap­plied to have the var­i­ous charges heard to­gether in one trial be­fore the Kuala Lumpur court, as they orig­i­nated in both Kuala Lumpur and Ge­orge Town.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Lim is also fac­ing two counts of mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of prop­erty for caus­ing two plots of land be­long­ing to the Pe­nang gov­ern­ment, worth RM208.8 mil­lion, to be dis­posed of by two com­pa­nies linked to the un­der­sea tun­nel project.</p>
    <p>Ses­sions Court Judge Azura Alwi agreed to have the charges heard to­gether and fixed 31 days for the trial to run from next June to De­cem­ber.</p>
