    <p>A Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional ship cut short its four-day cruise to nowhere and re­turned to Sin­ga­pore after an 83-year-old man on board tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The man was taken on Wed­nes­day af­ter­noon to hos­pi­tal, where his orig­i­nal sam­ple was retested at a na­tional lab­o­ra­tory and found to be neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>A fresh sam­ple tested by the lab also re­turned neg­a­tive on Wed­nes­day, a re­sult con­firmed yes­ter­day in a fi­nal test, in­di­cat­ing the re­sult on board the ship was a false pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times looks at what false pos­i­tives are.</p>
    <p>Q What is a false pos­i­tive or false neg­a­tive test re­sult, and why do they oc­cur?</p>
    <p>A A false pos­i­tive test re­sult means a per­son is wrongly di­ag­nosed as in­fected, while a false neg­a­tive means a true in­fec­tion is missed. They oc­cur as there is a mar­gin of er­ror in all Covid-19 tests, and none is ac­cu­rate all of the time.</p>
    <p>Q How likely are false pos­i­tives or neg­a­tives?</p>
    <p>A Sen­si­tiv­ity and speci­ficity are the two mea­sures of ac­cu­racy for Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>Sen­si­tiv­ity refers to a test’s abil­ity to iden­tify those in­fected as pos­i­tive. A test with lower sen­si­tiv­ity will have more false neg­a­tives, mean­ing more true in­fec­tions are missed. Speci­ficity refers to a test’s abil­ity to cor­rectly iden­tify those not in­fected as neg­a­tive. This means a test with lower speci­ficity has more false pos­i­tives.</p>
    <p>The de­fault test used in na­tional lab­o­ra­to­ries is the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test. It has a sen­si­tiv­ity rate of more than 93 per cent and a speci­ficity rate of more than 95 per cent, but it can take up to one or two days for re­sults to be out. Anti­gen rapid tests are faster, tak­ing only about 15 to 30 min­utes for re­sults to be ready. These have been used for test­ing be­fore largescale events, and have a sen­si­tiv­ity rate of 82 per cent and a speci­ficity rate of 99 per cent.</p>
    <p>Q Can the same test sam­ple yield dif­fer­ent re­sults?</p>
    <p>A Yes. First, be­cause of the vary­ing sen­si­tiv­ity and speci­ficity of each type of test, sub­ject­ing the same sam­ple to dif­fer­ent test­ing pro­to­cols can give dif­fer­ent re­sults. Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said it is pos­si­ble the test­ing regime in some cor­po­rate set­tings may use point-of-care tests or anti­gen rapid tests, which are able to de­liver a re­sult more quickly but tend to have a higher er­ror rate.</p>
    <p>It is thus pos­si­ble for some of the less ac­cu­rate pro­to­cols to yield an er­ro­neous find­ing when the same sam­ple is tested us­ing dif­fer­ent test­ing pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the coro­n­avirus en­zymes that might be present in a per­son’s swab sam­ple are sus­cep­ti­ble to degra­da­tion in the hos­tile ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment, said in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist Leong Hoe Nam. So, a sam­ple which tested pos­i­tive ear­lier may test neg­a­tive in sub­se­quent tests.</p>
    <p>Q What are the test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties on board cruise ships, and how do they dif­fer from those of na­tional lab­o­ra­to­ries?</p>
    <p>A Mr Michael Goh, head of in­ter­na­tional sales at Gent­ing Cruise Lines and pres­i­dent of Dream Cruises, said last month that its safety regime in­cludes a new real-time PCR ma­chine on board that yields Covid-19 test re­sults in 60 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Royal Caribbean also has some­thing sim­i­lar on board.</p>
    <p>While both liners did not re­veal the ac­cu­racy of the test­ing ma­chines on their ships, Mr Goh said yes­ter­day that the PCR ma­chine on Gent­ing’s World Dream was ap­proved by the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity, and PCR tests “re­main the most ac­cu­rate test avail­able to­day”.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong said the ac­cu­racy and pre­ci­sion of the ma­chines on cruise ships are likely to be lower than those of the Health Min­istry lab­o­ra­to­ries, but they are still use­ful within the scope of what they can do.</p>
    <p>Q What does the like­li­hood of false pos­i­tives mean for mass test­ing as large-scale ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume pro­gres­sively?</p>
    <p>A With no test able to be com­pletely ac­cu­rate, ex­perts said it is im­por­tant to learn how to cope when er­rors oc­cur.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said: “The re­al­ity is that, as test­ing be­comes more preva­lent, er­ro­neous re­sults will emerge. These will have knock-on ef­fects on whether a trav­eller is in­cor­rectly de­nied entry or par­tic­i­pa­tion, or whether some­one who is gen­uinely in­fected is missed and ends up seed­ing ad­di­tional cases in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“For ob­served pos­i­tive find­ings, es­pe­cially when di­ag­nosed with rapid or point-of-care tests, it may be worth un­der­go­ing a round of retest­ing, prefer­ably with an in­de­pen­dent test­ing pro­to­col to avoid any sys­tem­atic er­rors. This way, we avoid the false scares that can hap­pen, such as what hap­pened on the Royal Caribbean ship.”</p>
    <p>Dr Leong said retest­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties may not be avail­able on ships, as these tests are usu­ally done by lab ex­perts in con­sul­ta­tion with in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­perts. As a re­sult, he said, the cap­tain’s de­ci­sion to turn back on Wed­nes­day morn­ing was a pru­dent one.</p>
