    <p>AskST Law seeks to ad­dress var­i­ous le­gal is­sues faced or raised by af­fected par­ties. This in­au­gu­ral col­umn dwells on a nag­ging prob­lem in deal­ing with a jointly owned HDB flat post-di­vorce.</p>
    <p>If you have a ques­tion, e-mail us at askst@sph.com.sg</p>
    <p>Q My wife and I mar­ried in Sin­ga­pore last year but she con­tin­ues to live in an HDB flat jointly owned with her ex-hus­band. I am told I am not el­i­gi­ble to buy a flat on my own be­cause they have not dis­posed of their flat af­ter their di­vorce in 2015. I now live sep­a­rately in a rented room and meet my wife but not in her flat.</p>
    <p>Am I legally al­lowed to go and live in the flat as I am the le­gal hus­band and she is my wife?</p>
    <p>Her ex-spouse knows she has mar­ried again.</p>
    <p>A The hus­band does not have a right to re­side in the HDB flat of his spouse as he is not the owner listed in the ti­tle deeds, said fam­ily lawyer Beatrice Yeo, man­ag­ing part­ner of Yeo & As­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>“He does not ac­quire the au­to­matic right to live there by virtue of mar­riage. He was also not given a li­cence or per­mis­sion from the own­ers to go in to stay. His right to pur­chase a HDB flat with his wife is also com­pro­mised as HDB does not al­low one per­son to own two flats.”</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo said the flat owned by his wife and her ex-spouse needs to be dis­posed of as a mat­ter of law as the di­vorce would have meant the break­ing up of the fam­ily nu­cleus which had been the ba­sis for the pur­chase of the flat.</p>
    <p>It can be sold in the open mar­ket or to ei­ther of the ex-spouses.</p>
    <p>“By con­tin­u­ing to live in the flat, the di­vorced cou­ple would have po­ten­tially breached HDB rules and the new hus­band can approach a lawyer to for­mally cor­re­spond with the par­ties’ di­vorce lawyer in an at­tempt to in­form them of their obli­ga­tion or for­mally com­plain to the HDB.</p>
    <p>“Based on past ex­pe­ri­ence, the HDB will is­sue no­tice to re­pos­sess the flat, usu­ally within three months, should the par­ties refuse to sell the flat or to ef­fect trans­fer in fur­ther breach of any court or­der.”</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo added that the prob­lem faced by the reader is one vari­a­tion of a com­mon sce­nario she has en­coun­tered in her work.</p>
    <p>“Com­monly, even af­ter a court or­der is out, an ex-spouse may con­tinue liv­ing in the mat­ri­mo­nial home and refuse to move out for var­i­ous rea­sons. Some may have fi­nan­cial dif­fi­culty in get­ting a place to stay while oth­ers refuse to change en­vi­ron­ment, hav­ing lived in the flat for a long time, and some sim­ply just stay put to spite or ex­act re­venge on the ex-spouse,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Some may refuse to sign the rel­e­vant con­veyanc­ing doc­u­ments and this can usu­ally be cured by ap­ply­ing to court for the judge to sign on the con­veyanc­ing doc­u­ments to com­plete the sale on be­half of the de­fault­ing un­co­op­er­a­tive ex-spouse.</p>
    <p>“Court or­ders must be drafted con­cisely to take care of all these con­se­quences that may or may not hap­pen. DIY di­vorces or court or­ders not drafted by lawyers of­ten have im­por­tant clauses missing,” she added.</p>
    <p>“The applicant would then have to approach the Fam­ily Jus­tice Courts to vary the court or­der and in­clude the missing clause.”</p>
