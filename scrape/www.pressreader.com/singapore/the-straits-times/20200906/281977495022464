    <p>WASH­ING­TON Satel­lite imagery of a North Korean ship­yard on Fri­day shows ac­tiv­ity sug­ges­tive of prepa­ra­tions for a test of a medi­um­range sub­ma­rine-launched bal­lis­tic mis­sile, a US think-tank has re­ported.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (CSIS) said on Fri­day that the images it pub­lished on its web­site of North Korea’s Sinpo Ship­yard showed sev­eral ves­sels within a se­cure boat basin, one of which re­sem­bled ves­sels pre­vi­ously used to tow a sub­mersible test stand barge out to sea.</p>
    <p>It said the ac­tiv­ity was “sug­ges­tive, but not con­clu­sive, of prepa­ra­tions for an up­com­ing test of a Pukguk­song-3 sub­ma­rine launched bal­lis­tic mis­sile from the sub­mersible test stand barge”.</p>
    <p>North Korea said last Oc­to­ber that it had suc­cess­fully test-fired a Pukguk­song-3, a new sub­marinelaun­ched bal­lis­tic mis­sile (SLBM), from the sea as part of ef­forts to con­tain ex­ter­nal threats and bol­ster self-de­fence.</p>
    <p>That launch was seen by an­a­lysts as the most provoca­tive by North Korea since it en­tered di­a­logue with the United States over its nu­clear weapons and mis­sile pro­grammes in 2018.</p>
    <p>North Korea has sus­pended lon­grange mis­sile and nu­clear tests since 2017, but ef­forts led by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to per­suade it to give up its nu­clear and mis­sile pro­grammes have achieved lit­tle. Mr Trump is seek­ing re-elec­tion in Novem­ber and a North Korean mis­sile test be­fore that would high­light the lack of progress de­spite his un­prece­dented meet­ings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
    <p>There was no im­me­di­ate com­ment from the State De­part­ment or the Pen­tagon on the CSIS re­port.</p>
    <p>At a news con­fer­ence ear­lier on Fri­day, Mr Trump hailed his re­la­tion­ship with North Korea, say­ing that when he was elected, peo­ple had pre­dicted he would be at war with the coun­try within a week.</p>
    <p>“In the mean­time, we’ve got­ten along with them. We didn’t get to war,” he said.</p>
    <p>He has held up the ab­sence of in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­sile and nu­clear tests by North Korea since 2017 as a suc­cess from his diplo­macy and has sought to play down nu­mer­ous shorter-range tests dur­ing the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“North Korea al­ready tested a PKS-3 SLBM last Oc­to­ber. And it didn’t cross Trump’s red line then, and is un­likely to this time. Trump won’t care,” Mr Vipin Narang, a non-pro­lif­er­a­tion ex­pert at the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s mil­i­tary said the Pukguk­song-3 tested last year flew 450km and reached an al­ti­tude of 910km and would have had a range of about 1,300km on a stan­dard tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>News of the ac­tiv­ity at Sinpo comes amid signs that North Korea may be pre­par­ing for a ma­jor mil­i­tary parade in Oc­to­ber, which some an­a­lysts be­lieve could be used to show off new mis­siles as the coun­try has done at such events in the past.</p>
