    <p>COLOGNE (Ger­many) • Top seed Alexan­der Zverev bagged his first ATP crown of the year af­ter beat­ing Canada’s Felix Auger-Alias­sime 6-3, 6-3 to lift the bet­t1Hulks In­door ti­tle in Cologne yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man, who lost the US Open fi­nal last month and ex­ited the French Open in the fourth round, needed only 80 min­utes to get the bet­ter of the 20-year-old Cana­dian thanks to a dom­i­nant ser­vice per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Zverev won 80 per cent of his first ser­vice points and an over­whelm­ing 88 per cent on his sec­ond serve, while he also con­verted four of 10 break points to hand Auger-Alias­sime – who is still search­ing for his first ti­tle – a sixth de­feat in a fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“I had a very tough fi­nal in New York and the next fi­nal I played here, I wanted to come out and ob­vi­ously play my best ten­nis,” the 23-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“Felix, you’re an un­be­liev­able player. I know it doesn’t mean much right now, but I’m sure you’re not only go­ing to win one ti­tle, you’re go­ing to win mul­ti­ple ti­tles in your ca­reer, big­ger ti­tles than this.”</p>
    <p>Vic­tory gave Zverev his 12th ATP ti­tle and his third on home soil af­ter he won the Mu­nich Open in 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <p>He has al­ready qual­i­fied for the sea­son-end­ing ATP Fi­nals in Lon­don next month but will re­main in Cologne as the top seed at the bet­t1Hulks Cham­pi­onships, which start today.</p>
    <p>Auger-Alias­sime, who lost his first ATP fi­nal in Fe­bru­ary last year at the Rio Open, said: “I just played bad from start to fin­ish.”</p>
    <p>There was an­other win for a home favourite yes­ter­day, when Rus­sian An­drey Rublev took the hon­ours at the St Peters­burg fi­nal for his fourth ti­tle of the year.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old de­feated Borna Coric 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 as the Croa­t­ian fin­ished run­ner-up here for a sec­ond straight year.</p>
    <p>Rublev now has 34 ATP Tour match wins this sea­son, be­hind only world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic (37) – the only other man with four ti­tles this term.</p>
