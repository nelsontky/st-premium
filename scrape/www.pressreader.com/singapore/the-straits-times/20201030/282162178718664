    <p>Two new books on the ex­cesses of mer­i­toc­racy have lessons rel­e­vant for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>One is Har­vard pro­fes­sor Michael J. San­del’s lat­est book, The Tyranny Of Merit: What’s Be­come Of The Com­mon Good? (More on this book later).</p>
    <p>The other is Bri­tish writer David Good­hart’s Head Hand Heart: The Strug­gle For Dig­nity And Sta­tus In The 21st Cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Good­hart’s book is a warn­ing about the over-reach of “cog­ni­tive mer­i­toc­racy” and how it has cre­ated a sys­tem of what the au­thor calls “peak head”. This places those with Head skills (cog­ni­tive abil­ity) above those with Hand and Heart skills (those in man­ual and car­ing jobs). The re­sult is a lop­sided sys­tem that over-re­wards those with Head skills, leav­ing those with Hand and Heart skills lan­guish­ing be­hind in wages, sta­tus and re­spect, and feel­ing alien­ated.</p>
    <p>Good­hart, a for­mer Fi­nan­cial Times jour­nal­ist who went on to head var­i­ous think-tanks in Bri­tain, spoke about his lat­est book at a we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by the Straits Clan re­cently.</p>
    <p>I was the re­spon­dent at the we­bi­nar tasked by mod­er­a­tor James Crab­tree, an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor in prac­tice at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy, with com­ment­ing on Good­hart’s book from a Sin­ga­pore per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>In his book and re­marks at the we­bi­nar, Good­hart de­scribes how “peak head” so­ci­eties ex­tol cog­ni­tive abil­ity, and use ad­mis­sion to univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion as a sort­ing mech­a­nism to sieve out the bright­est cit­i­zens. He shows that over the decades, those who work with their hands (me­chan­ics, plumbers), or heart (care work­ers, nurses) have seen their wages, sta­tus and re­spect eroded, es­pe­cially in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Even as this group suf­fer a deficit in re­spect, they live in a so­ci­ety whose po­lit­i­cal rhetoric and eco­nomic sys­tem em­pha­sise the mar­ket, open­ness and glob­al­i­sa­tion – ar­guably fac­tors that have helped push down their wages.</p>
    <p>LIM­ITS OF SORT­ING</p>
    <p>How is this rel­e­vant to Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>As I noted at the we­bi­nar, we in Sin­ga­pore see and live the con­se­quences of a “peak head” so­ci­ety. Mer­i­toc­racy is akin to a</p>
    <p>“state re­li­gion” here, as Pro­fes­sor Crab­tree noted. The prin­ci­ple of sort­ing places and al­lo­cat­ing re­wards based on aca­demic merit is wo­ven into the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem (think of stream­ing), em­ploy­ment to pub­lic sec­tor jobs and re­cruit­ment to po­lit­i­cal of­fice. Those with cog­ni­tive skills not only ex­cel in school, but are also on track to good ca­reers that en­rich their lives.</p>
    <p>So Good­hart’s ap­peal for wages, sta­tus and re­spect to be more evenly spread among those with Hand and Heart, not just Head, skills is an im­por­tant mes­sage for Sin­ga­pore. As I put it starkly at the we­bi­nar: “Be­cause it is to­tally not sus­tain­able that we have a so­ci­ety where the cog­ni­tively skilled go around feel­ing well re­warded and well re­garded, while large seg­ments of the rest of our so­ci­ety suf­fer from pre­car­i­ous jobs, low wages and just go around feel­ing dis­re­spected. That is a recipe for mas­sive re­sent­ment and even­tu­ally mas­sive un­rest.”</p>
    <p>One con­so­la­tion for Sin­ga­pore is that we have not neared the sit­u­a­tions of Bri­tain and the</p>
    <p>United States, with de­clin­ing me­dian wages, ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment among grad­u­ates from non-elite uni­ver­si­ties, and the clos­ing of ac­cess to higher ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In­stead, as I told the vir­tual au­di­ence of about 100 at the event, we learnt from the Bri­tish ten­dency to over-fo­cus on aca­demic merit. So from the 1970s, Sin­ga­pore learnt from the Ja­panese, Ger­man and French to set up tech­ni­cal in­sti­tutes. To­day, our poly­tech­nics and in­sti­tutes of tech­ni­cal ed­u­ca­tion pro­vide a strong se­cond pil­lar of tech­ni­cal ed­u­ca­tion as good as its aca­demic, univer­sity sec­tor.</p>
    <p>This has trans­lated to wage growth: Sin­ga­pore’s me­dian in­comes grew 32 per cent in real terms over the last decade, buck­ing the trend of stag­nat­ing or de­clin­ing me­dian wages in many de­vel­oped coun­tries. In nom­i­nal terms, it is $4,600, up from $2,900.</p>
    <p>CONTRIBUTI­VE JUS­TICE</p>
    <p>One use­ful in­sight from Pro­fes­sor San­del is that peo­ple do not want dis­tribu­tive jus­tice so much as contributi­ve jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Many free mar­ket lib­er­als want an open econ­omy where re­wards flow to the able, and the use of taxes to sub­sidise the dis­ad­van­taged.</p>
    <p>But to Prof San­del, this is not enough.</p>
    <p>What the low-waged and unem­ployed want is not un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits or hand­outs. They long for work that pays enough for a de­cent life, and the chance to do work that con­trib­utes to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Lib­er­als to­day want dis­tribu­tive jus­tice – fairer, fuller ac­cess to the fruits of eco­nomic growth. Wel­fare ad­vo­cates want re­dis­tri­bu­tion in the form of state grants to re­place or aug­ment in­come.</p>
    <p>“But what these vot­ers want even more is a greater mea­sure of contributi­ve jus­tice – an op­por­tu­nity to win the so­cial recog­ni­tion and es­teem that goes with pro­duc­ing what oth­ers need and value,” writes Prof San­del.</p>
    <p>So giv­ing grants to sup­ple­ment in­come or strength­en­ing so­cial safety nets like in­creas­ing un­em­ploy­ment pay­outs won’t ad­dress the anger and re­sent­ment of those left be­hind.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause “the in­jury that most an­i­mates the re­sent­ment of work­ing peo­ple is to their sta­tus as pro­duc­ers. This in­jury is the com­bined ef­fort of mer­i­to­cratic sort­ing and mar­ket-driven glob­al­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Only a po­lit­i­cal agenda that ac­knowl­edges this in­jury and seeks to re­new the dig­nity of work can speak ef­fec­tively to the dis­con­tent that roils our pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“And it is in our role as pro­duc­ers, not con­sumers, that we con­trib­ute to the com­mon good and win recog­ni­tion for do­ing so.”</p>
    <p>The distinc­tion be­tween our roles as con­sumers and pro­duc­ers is im­por­tant. Our con­tri­bu­tion to the com­mon good is not as con­sumers who buy goods and ser­vices, but as pro­duc­ers – peo­ple who “de­velop and de­ploy our abil­i­ties to pro­vide goods and ser­vices that ful­fil the needs of our fel­low cit­i­zens and win so­cial es­teem”.</p>
    <p>So, as Prof San­del notes, in­stead of con­sum­ing more things and max­imis­ing gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, one can imag­ine that a well-func­tion­ing so­ci­ety’s goal is to cre­ate a labour mar­ket con­ducive to the dig­nity of work and so­cial co­he­sion.</p>
    <p>TAKE­AWAYS</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore­ans, the key take­aways from the books are these.</p>
    <p>First, even as we con­sole our­selves that our sys­tem of ed­u­ca­tion and jobs re­mains re­silient, of­fer­ing good path­ways and ca­reers to the masses and not just the exam-smart, we should not duck from the hard truth that an ex­ces­sively com­pet­i­tive sys­tem can cause a sim­i­lar cri­sis of re­spect and recog­ni­tion in our so­ci­ety, es­pe­cially among low-skilled work­ers and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Those who doubt this should read so­ci­ol­o­gist Teo You Yenn’s in­flu­en­tial 2018 book, This Is What In­equal­ity Looks Like. It stirred the con­science of many for its vivid de­scrip­tion of the class di­vide and the shame felt by low-waged work­ers and those seek­ing fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance. Be­fore Sin­ga­pore sees the po­lit­i­cal dys­func­tions that led Bri­tain to Brexit and the US to vote for a Don­ald Trump pres­i­dency, we should ad­dress the griev­ances of this group se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, we should think be­yond dis­tribu­tive jus­tice, to contributi­ve jus­tice. This is po­ten­tially rev­o­lu­tion­ary for Sin­ga­pore­ans. In­stead of cel­e­brat­ing cheap prices at hawker cen­tres or in clean­ing ser­vices, we need to think of how the labour mar­ket as a whole func­tions, and how to sup­port and sus­tain the en­tire ecosys­tem of work­ers – hawk­ers, hawker as­sis­tants, food sup­pli­ers, clean­ers, clean­ing su­per­vi­sors – so they can do pro­duc­tive work, con­trib­ute to the col­lec­tive good, and earn de­cent pay that al­lows them to take part as full cit­i­zens in the pub­lic arena.</p>
    <p>At its heart, the wound to so­ci­ety caused by an overly com­pet­i­tive mer­i­to­cratic so­ci­ety is a moral one – as much about loss of re­spect and dig­nity as it is about too-low wages and com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, if one’s sta­tus is de­ter­mined by birth, one can blame luck or fate. If sta­tus is based on one’s own ef­fort or abil­ity, one can only blame one­self. Hence Bri­tish so­ci­ol­o­gist Michael Young, who coined the term mer­i­toc­racy in his 1958 book The Rise Of The Mer­i­toc­racy, re­vis­ited the is­sue 40 years later to re­mark that in a so­ci­ety that makes so much of merit, hav­ing none leaves to­day’s un­der­class “morally naked”.</p>
    <p>To clothe the un­der­class with dig­nity to­day re­quires us to form and sup­port labour mar­kets that cre­ate jobs with de­cent pay for all, not just those with Head skills.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s open, glob­alised and com­pet­i­tive econ­omy has high in­come in­equal­ity – wages at the top are bid up by glob­ally ori­ented em­ploy­ers and wages for the low-skilled are kept down by the large pool of low-cost for­eign work­ers here who of­fer do­mes­tic ser­vice em­ploy­ers a cheap al­ter­na­tive source of labour.</p>
    <p>While past gen­er­a­tions have lived with this in­equal­ity, it is un­cer­tain if fu­ture gen­er­a­tions will. As noted above, Sin­ga­pore’s me­dian wage is ris­ing, as are av­er­age ed­u­ca­tion lev­els. A high me­dian car­ries its own brand of po­lit­i­cal risk.</p>
    <p>More than 95 per cent of young adults to­day get post-sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tion. This means Sin­ga­pore’s de­mo­graph­ics are chang­ing, from one with highly dif­fer­en­ti­ated ed­u­ca­tion lev­els, to one with a broad-based, highly ed­u­cated pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>We are be­com­ing a much flat­ter so­ci­ety with far less dif­fer­en­tial in ed­u­ca­tional achieve­ment. This is likely to re­duce the gap in ex­pec­ta­tions of the good life and have im­pact on as­pi­ra­tions, iden­tity and pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Mer­i­toc­racy as a jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for ex­plain­ing why some work­ers have low-pay­ing jobs and oth­ers earn mil­lions a year may have in­spired a past gen­er­a­tion to strive to be­come win­ners by dint of abil­ity and ef­fort. But can it re­main per­sua­sive to a gen­er­a­tion where nine in 10 have earned a post-sec­ondary qual­i­fi­ca­tion and feel they are of good enough merit?</p>
    <p>How do you jus­tify high in­come in­equal­ity to some­one who went to the same polytech­nic or univer­sity, served in the same na­tional ser­vice vo­ca­tion and bought their first flat in the same Hous­ing Board es­tate as the other 35-year-old who earns 10 times his salary?</p>
    <p>In­ter-gen­er­a­tional gaps in in­come, as­pi­ra­tions and ex­pec­ta­tions will con­tinue. But as as­pi­ra­tions and ex­pec­ta­tions con­verge among the younger gen­er­a­tion, we need a ma­jor ef­fort to re­think the role of mer­i­toc­racy and how to al­lo­cate work, wages and worth more eq­ui­tably.</p>
    <p>Mer­i­toc­racy as a jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for ex­plain­ing why some work­ers have low-pay­ing jobs and oth­ers earn mil­lions a year may have in­spired a past gen­er­a­tion to strive to be­come win­ners by dint of abil­ity and ef­fort. But can it re­main per­sua­sive to a gen­er­a­tion where nine in 10 have earned a post-sec­ondary qual­i­fi­ca­tion and feel they are of good enough merit?</p>
