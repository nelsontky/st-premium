    <p>Four prod­ucts sold on e-com­merce sites and so­cial me­dia plat­forms have been found to con­tain banned sub­stances or lax­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Three of the prod­ucts – Nutri­line Thinsline, KiMiSo Dark Cho­co­late, and Wholly Fitz Pas­sion Lemon Tea – con­tain sibu­tramine, a banned sub­stance that could in­crease the risk of heart at­tack and stroke. The fourth, Nutri­line Cleansline, con­tains the lax­a­tive sen­no­side, said the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic should not pur­chase or con­sume these prod­ucts, the HSA said, adding that all sellers and sup­pli­ers must stop sell­ing these prod­ucts im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>The HSA said a wo­man had re­ported that she ex­pe­ri­enced ex­treme thirst, ir­reg­u­lar heart­beat and loss of ap­petite af­ter tak­ing one sa­chet of Nutri­line Thinsline.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions by the au­thor­ity found that the prod­uct was usu­ally sold to­gether with Nutri­line Cleansline.</p>
    <p>Both prod­ucts had been mar­keted as nat­u­ral sup­ple­ments for weight loss and detox­i­fi­ca­tion, with claims that they con­trol the ap­petite and raise the me­tab­o­lism of users.</p>
    <p>Another wo­man alerted the HSA to KiMiSo Dark Cho­co­late. She sus­pected the prod­uct con­tained po­tent in­gre­di­ents af­ter read­ing re­views.</p>
    <p>The prod­uct claimed to pro­mote weight loss with no lax­a­tives and no side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>HSA tested it and de­tected sibu­tramine and diphen­hy­dramine, an an­ti­his­tamine which causes drowsi­ness and can pose a risk to con­sumers who drive or op­er­ate ma­chin­ery.</p>
    <p>The prod­ucts were sold on lo­cal e-com­merce plat­forms such as Shopee and Qoo10, and so­cial me­dia plat­forms such as Face­book and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>The HSA has is­sued warn­ings to the sellers of these four prod­ucts, and di­rected the re­spec­tive web­site ad­min­is­tra­tors to re­move the af­fected list­ings.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers are ad­vised to stop tak­ing these prod­ucts im­me­di­ately and to con­sult a doc­tor if they are feel­ing un­well or are con­cerned about their health.</p>
    <p>The HSA said the pub­lic should be wary of health prod­ucts that carry ex­ag­ger­ated claims.</p>
    <p>“There is no quick and easy way to lose weight. Weight con­trol should be achieved through a com­bi­na­tion of bal­anced diet and ap­pro­pri­ate ex­er­cise,” the au­thor­ity added.</p>
    <p>Sellers and sup­pli­ers of prod­ucts with banned and harm­ful in­gre­di­ents will be pros­e­cuted. If convicted, they may be jailed for up to two years or fined up to $10,000 or both.</p>
