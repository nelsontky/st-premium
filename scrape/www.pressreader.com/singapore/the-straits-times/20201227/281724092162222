    <p>Win­ner of the 2020 Life Theatre Awards for Best Ac­tress.</p>
    <p>“2020 should have been a pretty good year for me, be­cause I had most of the year filled up with work.</p>
    <p>Then the in­dus­try that I had strug­gled to find a place in started fall­ing apart, and it’s still kind of fall­ing apart now. I just don’t know whether it’ll ever go back to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>My hus­band and I started mak­ing dig­i­tal work. Re­cently, I wrote a script called Pivot, which fea­tures a bunch of dig­i­tal me­dia that artists have had to pivot to this year, such as Zoom theatre, pod­casts and so on.</p>
    <p>I was also a small part of The Good Prac­tices In Sin­ga­pore Theatre Work Group (to cod­ify best prac­tices and im­prove pro­tec­tion for free­lancers), for which a first work­ing draft has been cre­ated.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple in the in­dus­try have been hard done by with Covid-19 mag­ni­fy­ing in­her­ent is­sues in the sys­tem, and we’re all try­ing to put pieces of our lives back to­gether.”</p>
