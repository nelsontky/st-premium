    <p>Even as Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally re­cov­ers from the dev­as­ta­tion of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the road ahead re­mains chal­leng­ing and un­cer­tain. This in­cludes deal­ing with so­cial prob­lems wrought by the pan­demic, such as fam­ily vi­o­lence and men­tal health is­sues. As­sis­tant Su­per­in­ten­dent of Po­lice (ASP) Ti­mothy Yap also notes that Sin­ga­pore­ans need to be pre­pared for the so­cio-eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19 and how it will af­fect crime trends and com­mu­nity re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>De­spite the chal­lenges ahead, the</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF) re­mains stead­fast in safe­guard­ing Sin­ga­pore, even in these un­cer­tain times.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple in the com­mu­nity nat­u­rally look to po­lice of­fi­cers to take charge in dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tions,” adds ASP Yap. “They are rou­tinely re­lied upon to main­tain a cool head in the face of un­pre­dictable cir­cum­stances, and to make sound de­ci­sions with lim­ited in­for­ma­tion un­der de­mand­ing and stress­ful con­di­tions. We know how im­por­tant it is to lis­ten and to work closely with the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>A JOB THAT TESTS MET­TLE AND RE­SOLVE</p>
    <p>From his first day on the job in 2017, ASP Yap has been hon­ing his lead­er­ship skills. “I have learnt that, at its core, ex­er­cis­ing lead­er­ship en­tails two things. The first is a readi­ness to make sac­ri­fices in the line of duty, putting the in­ter­ests of oth­ers above our own,” he ex­plains. “The sec­ond is a will­ing­ness to make tough de­ci­sions and stand firmly by them while also hav­ing the hu­mil­ity to con­cede that we may not al­ways be right.”</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old has been mak­ing his rounds in the var­i­ous func­tions, start­ing as a Ground Re­sponse Force of­fi­cer at Bukit Merah East Neigh­bour­hood Po­lice Cen­tre, then mov­ing on to do in­ves­ti­ga­tion work in the Spe­cial Vic­tims Unit of the Cen­tral Di­vi­sion. Cur­rently, as a Se­nior In­ves­ti­ga­tion Of­fi­cer at the Spe­cial In­ves­ti­ga­tion Sec­tion of the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment, he in­ves­ti­gates ma­jor crimes such as homi­cides, firearms of­fences and kid­nap­pings.</p>
    <p>There is never a dull day on the job. In just over three years, ASP Yap has re­sponded to “999” emer­gen­cies as a pa­trol of­fi­cer, in­ves­ti­gated and ar­rested sex­ual preda­tors, and at­tended to scenes of un­nat­u­ral deaths and vi­o­lent homi­cides. The young of­fi­cer says: “These sit­u­a­tions have un­doubt­edly been dif­fi­cult, dis­tress­ing and tragic. Yet, these are also mo­ments where the mis­sion at hand is the most crit­i­cal — to re­lent­lessly pur­sue the truth, to com­fort the bro­ken-hearted and to bring the of­fend­ers to jus­tice. It is a real test of met­tle and re­solve, one that builds strength of char­ac­ter.”</p>
    <p>On the flip side, ASP Yap is also heart­ened by the in­stances of ev­ery­day hero­ism he has wit­nessed on the job. Many crimes have been solved with the as­sis­tance of public-spir­ited wit­nesses who come for­ward to pro­vide cru­cial ev­i­dence. To that end, polic­ing work has of­fered ASP Yap a glimpse into the vi­cis­si­tudes of life and pro­vided in­sight into how peo­ple in var­i­ous seg­ments of so­ci­ety live.</p>
    <p>“(Po­lice of­fi­cers) are rou­tinely re­lied upon to main­tain a cool head in the face of un­pre­dictable cir­cum­stances, and to make sound de­ci­sions with lim­ited in­for­ma­tion un­der de­mand­ing and stress­ful con­di­tions.”</p>

    <p>Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force</p>
    <p>HU­MAN FACE OF THE LAW</p>
    <p>ASP Yap wanted to serve in the SPF be­cause of his in­ter­est in crim­i­nal jus­tice and le­gal af­fairs. He had con­sid­ered a ca­reer as a prose­cu­tor or crim­i­nal lawyer but, ul­ti­mately, it was his first­hand ex­pe­ri­ence of po­lice work while shad­ow­ing of­fi­cers on duty that drew him to don a uni­form in­stead of a robe.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence showed me that polic­ing prac­tices and poli­cies have a di­rect and tan­gi­ble im­pact on peo­ple’s lives. One might even say that po­lice of­fi­cers are the hu­man face of the law, be­ing in a po­si­tion to shape peo­ple’s lived ex­pe­ri­ences and per­cep­tions of the au­thor­i­ties. Fair, ef­fec­tive and hu­mane en­force­ment builds trust and in­stils con­fi­dence in the jus­tice sys­tem,” he says.</p>
    <p>ASP Ti­mothy Yap said he is of­ten heart­ened by the in­stances of ev­ery­day hero­ism he has wit­nessed on the job.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his A lev­els, ASP Yap was awarded the Pres­i­dent’s Schol­ar­ship and Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force Schol­ar­ship. He went on to pur­sue a Bach­e­lor of Arts in Ju­rispru­dence (Law) at the Univer­sity of Ox­ford in Eng­land. Af­ter­wards, ASP Yap ex­tended his stud­ies by a year at Har­vard Law School in Cam­bridge, Mas­sachusetts, to re­ceive a mas­ter’s de­gree in law.</p>
    <p>While a law de­gree may not seem im­me­di­ately ap­pli­ca­ble to po­lice work, ASP Yap says he wanted to de­velop an un­der­stand­ing of the prin­ci­ples and philoso­phies un­der­pin­ning the very laws he would be trained to up­hold as an of­fi­cer. “A le­gal ed­u­ca­tion chal­lenges the mind and de­vel­ops char­ac­ter. It is in­tel­lec­tu­ally rig­or­ous and ful­fill­ing, train­ing you to think crit­i­cally to weigh ar­gu­ments and to ap­proach prob­lems from dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives. Most im­por­tantly, it also in­vites you to con­sider com­plex so­cial, po­lit­i­cal and eth­i­cal is­sues that in­flu­ence the devel­op­ment of a so­ci­ety’s le­gal sys­tem,” he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he also points out that just hav­ing laws is not suf­fi­cient to de­ter would-be of­fend­ers un­less they are en­forced — and are seen to be en­forced — with cer­tainty and fair­ness.</p>
    <p>He views crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions as a rig­or­ous craft — ev­ery case has unique as­pects and presents a dis­tinct chal­lenge. Much like how po­lice work is a meld­ing of his in­ter­est in crim­i­nal jus­tice and le­gal af­fairs, crack­ing a case of­ten re­lies on a com­bi­na­tion of in­ter­view­ing skills, le­gal knowl­edge, foren­sics and prob­lem-solv­ing smarts. “It is cer­tainly not as glam­orous as the TV shows would have you be­lieve, and there are times when the work feels tire­some and thank­less. Yet, the op­por­tu­ni­ties for learn­ing and per­sonal growth are sec­ond to none,” he says.</p>
    <p>As he grows and ma­tures as a po­lice of­fi­cer, ASP Yap has one key ob­jec­tive — to safe­guard Sin­ga­pore’s way of life by solv­ing crime. “It mat­ters greatly to me that in Sin­ga­pore, we can go about our daily pur­suits freely and with peace of mind, as­sured that our safety is in good hands,” he adds.</p>
