    <p>Ja­pan is a fas­ci­nat­ing place. Apart from the won­der­ful food, ar­chi­tec­ture and so­cial at­trac­tions of its ma­jor cities, it also has count­less tra­di­tional fes­ti­vals and colour­ful pro­ces­sions to en­joy. Al­most ev­ery Shinto shrine around the coun­try hon­ours its own de­ity with a unique an­nual fes­ti­val which makes the cul­tural land­scape in­cred­i­bly rich and var­ied.</p>
    <p>There are fes­ti­vals to cel­e­brate the chang­ing of the sea­sons, the earth it­self, old trees, stones and rocks, pu­rifi­ca­tion of the soul, com­ing of age and fer­til­ity. I at­tribute this to the Ja­panese love and re­spect for na­ture and their rev­er­ence for any­thing or­ganic that comes from the earth.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber as the har­vest sea­son comes to an end in Ja­pan, there is an in­trigu­ing thanks­giv­ing fes­ti­val there that, at its philo­soph­i­cal core, res­onates with my own phi­los­o­phy of life and beauty. I learnt of this fes­ti­val by chance, from a tele­vi­sion doc­u­men­tary many years ago, but I can’t tell you the name of the town it hap­pens in as I mis­placed the piece of pa­per I jot­ted it down on.</p>
    <p>All I can re­mem­ber is that this lit­tle farm­ing town or vil­lage lies far away from Tokyo and its in­hab­i­tants are very sim­ple down-to-earth folk. There is a town hall with a soli­tary clock tower, and the old-fash­ioned low-rise wooden houses ra­di­ate out from the town cen­tre in an or­derly fash­ion.</p>
    <p>For much of the year, the town is like any other sleepy coun­try­side ham­let, but in au­tumn when they cel­e­brate the har­vest, some­thing in­ter­est­ing hap­pens. For three to four months lead­ing up to the har­vest, all the in­hab­i­tants start to build an elab­o­rate sculp­ture that they will dis­play in their house.</p>
    <p>But these are not or­di­nary sculp­tures. They are sculp­tures made up en­tirely of “found” util­i­tar­ian earth­en­ware ob­jects such as plates, bowls, cups, pots, pans, jars – any­thing that might have come out of a kiln and has its own dis­tinct func­tion.</p>
    <p>These ob­jects which come in many dif­fer­ent shapes and sizes are held to­gether only by wires. The rule of the game is that the ob­jects can­not be bro­ken, drilled into or stuck to one an­other with glue or any­thing ar­ti­fi­cial. Only wires that en­cir­cle each ob­ject can be used to bind one ob­ject to an­other.</p>
    <p>Al­though the in­hab­i­tants of this town are not trained artists in any way, year af­ter year, they come up with the most amaz­ing ren­di­tions of birds, flow­ers, an­i­mals and even struc­tures like a bi­cy­cle, a car or a small aero­plane, all made up of plates and bowls.</p>
    <p>The en­tire fam­ily is in­volved in sourc­ing the parts and putting the sculp­ture to­gether. Ev­ery­one has a role to play. Some of the sculp­tures can be mon­u­men­tal.</p>
    <p>Then dur­ing the month when they cel­e­brate the har­vest of their crops, these fam­i­lies dis­play their sculp­tures in the front hall of their homes and open their doors so that any­one (even tourists) can freely walk in to view the sculp­tures and the liv­ing con­di­tions of the town folk.</p>
    <p>This is the one time of the year when any­one can visit their homes, sim­i­lar to our own Chi­nese New Year which is es­sen­tially open house to any­one who wants to visit and pay their re­spects.</p>
    <p>At the end of the fes­ti­val, a com­mit­tee from the town hall will in­spect each sculp­ture to choose the most beau­ti­ful or in­ter­est­ing one which is then trans­ferred to the town hall where it will be dis­played for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>All the other sculp­tures are dis­man­tled and their com­po­nents re­turned to the kitchen, din­ing room or wher­ever they came from. Some are stored in a shed wait­ing to be­come an­other cre­ation in the fol­low­ing year. The fam­i­lies re­turn to their daily lives.</p>
    <p>It is fas­ci­nat­ing to con­tem­plate the cre­ativ­ity and ef­fort poured into the mak­ing of an in­tri­cate sculp­ture that will be ap­pre­ci­ated only for a month and then taken apart again.</p>
    <p>There is some­thing spir­i­tu­ally calm­ing about this en­deav­our and the ac­cep­tance to cre­ate some­thing so im­per­ma­nent. I sup­pose eat­ing a won­der­ful meal is the same. The chef takes hours to cre­ate his master­piece and yet it is de­voured in sec­onds.</p>
    <p>I was re­minded of this quaint fes­ti­val of found sculp­tures when I was hol­i­day­ing with my chil­dren in Hokkaido a few Christ­mases ago. It was mid­night and we had been prowl­ing around our ho­tel, look­ing for a con­ve­nience store to buy some sup­per when it started to snow heav­ily. Soon a thick car­pet of crisp pow­der snow lay around us and we de­cided to build a snow­man.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally, a snow­man would have a round body and a round ball of a head, but this year the snow was so ad­he­sive and com­pact that we man­aged to con­struct a proper snow­man with arms, legs, a head and neck and even chest mus­cles and a belly bulge.</p>
    <p>We called him Mr Kobayashi. We were so pleased with our ef­forts and took turns to pose with him. The next day when we went back to visit him, poor Mr Kobayashi had col­lapsed and bro­ken up into sev­eral bits.</p>
    <p>How tran­sient his ex­is­tence had been. How­ever we felt no sad­ness or re­gret as we val­ued the pre­cious time we had spent mak­ing him.</p>
    <p>This had al­lowed us to do some­thing to­gether as a fam­ily and the mem­ory of that happy oc­ca­sion will stay with us for­ever. I re­alised that it is not al­ways about the fi­nal re­sult. Some­times, the process of get­ting there is just as mean­ing­ful.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who make ice sculp­tures or sand­cas­tles must feel the same way – tremen­dous sat­is­fac­tion at hav­ing cre­ated some­thing beau­ti­ful yet know­ing that their cre­ations can­not last.</p>
    <p>The essence of plas­tic surgery is no dif­fer­ent. We strive to cre­ate re­sults that we know will not en­dure. But this does not mat­ter to our pa­tients. They en­joy the re­sults for as long as they last. They will in­evitably age and, soon, there will be noth­ing left of our ef­forts. But it doesn’t mat­ter. When you are aware that some­thing has so fleet­ing an ex­is­tence, it is trea­sured more.</p>
