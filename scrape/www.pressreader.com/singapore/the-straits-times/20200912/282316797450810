    <p>Forum con­trib­u­tor Sean Lim’s point about the low take-up of vac­cines be­ing linked to vac­cine ac­ces­si­bil­ity, and his call to take vac­ci­na­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties closer to tar­get pop­u­la­tions are very rel­e­vant (Go be­yond cut­ting costs in bid to in­crease up­take of vac­cines, Sept 9).</p>
    <p>Hav­ing seen my hus­band suf­fer from shin­gles, I wanted to get vac­ci­nated against it.</p>
    <p>Try­ing to go about get­ting it done was no easy task.</p>
    <p>There was lit­tle in­for­ma­tion on the In­ter­net about where I could get the jab. I made mul­ti­ple calls to phar­ma­cies, gov­ern­ment and pri­vate hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>What was sur­pris­ing was the re­ac­tion I got from big hos­pi­tals like Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal and Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal when I in­quired about get­ting a shin­gles jab.</p>
    <p>The per­son on the other end of the phone line was caught off-guard by my re­quest. The staff had no in­for­ma­tion on hand, I was put on hold for a con­sid­er­able amount of time be­fore be­ing given un­sat­is­fac­tory an­swers. The price of the vac­cine var­ied from $190 to $525 per dose plus doc­tor’s con­sul­ta­tion fee, and there was no guar­an­tee of avail­abil­ity of stock.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a long and te­dious hunt, I fi­nally found that Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal ad­min­is­tered the vac­cine, and made an ap­point­ment. Any­one less per­sis­tent would have given up.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment should con­sider a one-stop venue at hos­pi­tals and poly­clin­ics for var­i­ous vac­ci­na­tions, bring down the cost, or at least stan­dard­ise the cost to the pub­lic, ed­u­cate the pub­lic, and ed­u­cate front-line staff at med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
