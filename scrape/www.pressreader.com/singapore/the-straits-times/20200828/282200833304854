    <p>The Cen­tre for Do­mes­tic Em­ploy­ees (CDE) is con­cerned about Forum contributo­r Ish­war Murlid­har Mah­tani’s sug­ges­tion of al­low­ing co-em­ploy­ment of do­mes­tic work­ers (Con­sider al­low­ing co-em­ploy­ment of maids, Aug 22).</p>
    <p>The ba­sis of this ar­gu­ment seems to stem from the per­cep­tion that some em­ploy­ers may have weak­ened fi­nan­cial sta­tus due to the cur­rent economic sit­u­a­tion, but still re­quire the ser­vices of a for­eign do­mes­tic worker (FDW). It fur­ther sug­gests the no­tion of hav­ing an FDW work at two places with dou­ble the work­load.</p>
    <p>CDE strongly holds the view that such a no­tion is un­rea­son­able and ex­ploita­tive in na­ture. Co-em­ploy­ment will only drive FDWs to seek out em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Based on our ground in­ter­ac­tions with FDWs, we note that many feel stressed es­pe­cially in the early stages of em­ploy­ment be­cause it takes time to learn and fa­mil­iarise them­selves with their em­ployer’s ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>For some, they also face com­mu­ni­ca­tion bar­ri­ers with their em­ployer. For oth­ers, it is the stress from car­ing for the young or el­derly or more vul­ner­a­ble fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>If co-em­ploy­ment is al­lowed, this will in­evitably mean ad­di­tional stress is placed on the FDW daily as she has to learn to man­age the needs of both house­holds ef­fec­tively. The FDW may even­tu­ally ex­pe­ri­ence burnout.</p>
    <p>Also, imag­ine a sit­u­a­tion where a co-em­ployed FDW gets in­jured in an ac­ci­dent while trav­el­ling from one house­hold to an­other, suf­fers an in­jury or falls gravely ill while work­ing in one of the house­holds.</p>
    <p>Can both em­ploy­ers come to a mu­tu­ally ac­cept­able agree­ment on who will foot the bill or co-share the por­tion, bear­ing in mind that for­eign­ers do not en­joy any med­i­cal sub­si­dies?</p>
    <p>Such in­ci­dents will add more stress to the em­ploy­ers es­pe­cially if they are un­der­go­ing dif­fi­cul­ties dur­ing this chal­leng­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The job of an FDW is phys­i­cally de­mand­ing and re­quires much pa­tience and pro­fes­sion­al­ism. They can per­form ef­fec­tively if their work­load is man­age­able, es­pe­cially when they are car­ing for fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Other op­tions pro­vided by clean­ing com­pa­nies can be ex­plored for those who need part-time do­mes­tic help.</p>
