    <p>Katy Perry has opened up about how her fi­ance, English ac­tor Or­lando Bloom, has been a con­stant source of sup­port, Harper’s Bazaar re­ported.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view on The Howard Stern Show on Tues­day, the 35-year-old Amer­i­can singer, who is ex­pect­ing her first child with the Lord Of The Rings ac­tor, said he is the “only one” who can han­dle her on her dark­est days.</p>
    <p>Bloom, Perry noted, was in­stru­men­tal in help­ing her through a de­pres­sion that stemmed from the dis­ap­point­ing re­lease of her 2017 al­bum Wit­ness, which she said “didn’t nec­es­sar­ily meet my ex­pec­ta­tions”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she ac­knowl­edged it was in­te­gral to her growth: “It got me out of this loop of be­ing a re­ally des­per­ate, thirsty pop star who felt like she had to be No. 1 all the time. Now, I feel like I can cre­ate and be more di­men­sional as an artist and also as a hu­man be­ing.”</p>
    <p>On her up­com­ing and sixth al­bum Smile, due to be re­leased on Aug 14, she said: “To be hon­est, this record is full of hope­ful­ness and re­silience and joy be­cause it was made dur­ing a dark time (her de­pres­sion).”</p>
    <p>Through the dif­fi­cult pe­riod, Perry said Bloom, 43, dealt with “all” that she was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing: “I still test him, he still shows up, he still is not fazed by it.”</p>
    <p>“And that is why,” she added, “he is perfect for me.”</p>
    <p>She also talked about their un­born daugh­ter and be­ing preg­nant in a pan­demic: “I think 2020 is the year where if you make plans, God laughs.</p>
    <p>“So, I have re­ally been go­ing with the flow and I have a cou­ple of ideas for that date com­ing soon. Very soon.”</p>
