    <p>Af­ter 64-year-old sheet metal worker Lee Keng Hee man­u­fac­tured sev­eral metal air­guns that can launch 6mm steel ball bear­ings, he fired them at nearby Hous­ing Board blocks, break­ing the win­dows of some units. Yes­ter­day, he was sen­tenced to 18 weeks’ jail and fined $2,000.</p>
    <p>In­trigued by the work­ings of a Nerf gun – a plas­tic toy gun that fires foam pro­jec­tiles – a 64-year-old sheet metal worker man­u­fac­tured sev­eral metal air­guns that can launch 6mm steel ball bear­ings.</p>
    <p>To test the range of his air­gun, Lee Keng Hee shot the bear­ings from his Jurong West home, ini­tially aim­ing at trees.</p>
    <p>Af­ter build­ing a more pow­er­ful third gun, Lee tar­geted neigh­bour­ing Hous­ing Board blocks, break­ing the win­dows of some units.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Lee was sen­tenced to 18 weeks’ jail and given a fine of $2,000 for man­u­fac­tur­ing an air­gun with­out a li­cence and shoot­ing ball bear­ings at res­i­den­tial blocks.</p>
    <p>Two other re­lated charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Regina Lim de­scribed the air­gun that Lee made and shot at the flats as in­her­ently dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>She said the ball bear­ings were able to crack glass at a dis­tance of more than 77m. She added that Lee had “a high de­gree of per­sis­tence”, spend­ing 10 months to man­u­fac­ture sev­eral guns.</p>
    <p>DPP Lim noted that Lee shot more than 200 ball bear­ings us­ing his air­guns.</p>
    <p>Lee’s lawyer, Mr Fa­vian Kang, said his client was re­morse­ful and had “made resti­tu­tion vol­un­tar­ily (and was) not prompted to” do so.</p>
    <p>Lee sold his late mother’s jew­ellery to make resti­tu­tion, Mr Kang added.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Lee had come across a Nerf gun in 2017 and be­gan study­ing its mech­a­nism.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to make an air­gun from watch­ing videos on YouTube and us­ing scrap metal col­lected from his work­place.</p>
    <p>In 2018, while work­ing on his first two air­guns, he bought 100 6mm steel ball bear­ings and 100 8mm steel ball bear­ings to test the air­guns at home.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber that year, he com­pleted a third and more pow­er­ful air­gun. Court doc­u­ments show he wanted it to have more power and bet­ter con­sis­tency than the first two.</p>
    <p>He con­structed it with a big­ger air cham­ber to fire more ball bear­ings with each full pump of the air cham­ber.</p>
    <p>Lee shot at trees and neigh­bour­ing blocks from his eighth-storey flat, usu­ally out of sight of his wife and son who live with him.</p>
    <p>From these tests, he was sat­is­fied that the third air­gun was able to con­sis­tently fire the 6mm ball bear­ings into the con­crete walls of Block 453 Jurong West Street 42, which is across from his home.</p>
    <p>He con­tin­ued us­ing the block for tar­get prac­tice un­til early last year.</p>
    <p>On April 3 that year, a res­i­dent called the po­lice around 8pm, say­ing he heard a crack be­fore dis­cov­er­ing his bed­room win­dow was bro­ken.</p>
    <p>Lee was ar­rested af­ter the po­lice found an air­gun in his home.</p>
    <p>Flats that suf­fered dam­age were in the line of sight of his flat.</p>
    <p>Tests run by the author­i­ties found that the ball bear­ings shot from the air­gun had enough power to cause non-lethal in­juries if aimed at a per­son.</p>
    <p>The speed of the ball bear­ing on im­pact was found to be fast enough to crack the glass of a win­dow.</p>
    <p>For man­u­fac­tur­ing guns or deal­ing in them, an of­fender can be jailed for up to three years and fined a max­i­mum of $10,000.</p>
    <p>For com­mit­ting a rash act, an of­fender can face a jail term of up to six months or a fine of up to $2,500, or both.</p>
