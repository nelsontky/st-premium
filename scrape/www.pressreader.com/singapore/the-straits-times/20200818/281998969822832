    <p>The min­is­te­rial state­ment yes­ter­day re­veals com­mend­able con­ti­nu­ity in the Govern­ment’s poli­cies to save jobs and pro­tect vul­ner­a­ble sec­tors of the econ­omy. Although the ex­tent of the sup­port will be scaled down, it has been fine-tuned to fit chang­ing cir­cum­stances. Thus, a scaled-back ver­sion of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) will con­tinue to help work­ers, and $8 bil­lion will be spent to save and cre­ate new jobs and seize fresh growth op­por­tu­ni­ties. In making the an­nounce­ment, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat noted the dire cir­cum­stances Sin­ga­pore is in. The global econ­omy is pro­jected to con­tract by 5 per cent this year. Sin­ga­pore has ex­pe­ri­enced its worst quar­terly per­for­mance on record – a 13.2 per cent con­trac­tion year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter of 2020. Al­ready, the Govern­ment has ded­i­cated close to $100 bil­lion over four Budgets to sup­port­ing peo­ple and busi­nesses in the cri­sis. How­ever, some ame­lio­ra­tive mea­sures are end­ing soon, and Sin­ga­pore is not out of the woods.</p>
    <p>Hence the mea­sures out­lined yes­ter­day. Among them are the ex­ten­sion of the JSS, which will help firms re­tain lo­cal work­ers, and the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant for Sin­ga­pore­ans who are un­em­ployed or have suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss. At the mo­ment, the JSS cov­ers the wages of em­ployed work­ers up to this month. It will be ex­tended by up to seven months, cov­er­ing wages paid up to next March. How­ever, the scheme can­not be sus­tained at cur­rent lev­els, both be­cause it draws heav­ily on Sin­ga­pore’s re­serves and be­cause it could keep work­ers in busi­nesses that are not sus­tain­able any more. Also, some sec­tors are re­cov­er­ing faster than oth­ers. Fis­cal pru­dence re­quires the Govern­ment to there­fore al­lo­cate funds in tar­geted ways that ben­e­fit vi­able busi­nesses and their em­ploy­ees, and to avoid waste. Sadly, many jobs will go in spite of the ar­ray of help schemes, par­tic­u­larly those in the most vul­ner­a­ble seg­ments of badly hit sec­tors. How­ever, fol­low­ing the cruel but inescapabl­e logic of cre­ative de­struc­tion, these job losses will free up work­ers who could move into the sus­tain­able econ­omy with proper re­train­ing and reskilling.</p>
    <p>Look­ing out over an ad­mit­tedly dis­mal hori­zon, a new scheme – the $1 bil­lion Jobs Growth In­cen­tive pro­gramme – will be launched to sup­port growth sec­tors such as bio­med­i­cal sciences, health­care and finance. Re­as­sur­ingly, Sin­ga­pore be­gan its eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion five years ago, when it de­vel­oped In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Maps for 23 sec­tors. The coro­n­avirus pan­demic did not cre­ate struc­tural shifts, but it has ac­cel­er­ated many of them. Busi­nesses, labour and the Govern­ment must con­tinue to act in con­cert so that the eco­nomic up­turn, when it comes, will see Sin­ga­pore­ans be­ing bet­ter pre­pared to take ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties in the post-Covid-19 world. Yes­ter­day’s mea­sures are a step in that di­rec­tion.</p>
