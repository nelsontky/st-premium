    <p>Even ex­perts may dis­agree.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, not on ma­jor is­sues, but on in­ter­pret­ing the facts or their as­sess­ment of sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>They also see things very dif­fer­ently from the lay pub­lic.</p>
    <p>This was what struck me the most dur­ing The Straits Times Covid-19 we­bi­nar yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Take vac­cines, for ex­am­ple. The whole world is wait­ing for a vi­able vac­cine so it can pro­tect peo­ple and life can re­turn to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts say no, it’s not a magic bul­let. Stay­ing pro­tected re­quires a com­bi­na­tion of a good vac­cine, good treat­ment that re­duces sever­ity of the ill­ness, and good so­cial be­hav­iour so fewer peo­ple get in­fected.</p>
    <p>They also agree that there isn’t go­ing to be a com­mer­cially avail­able vac­cine any time this year.</p>
    <p>Where they po­litely dif­fer from one an­other is whether this rush for a vac­cine is a good thing.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, wor­ries that the first com­mer­cially avail­able vac­cine may not be the best.</p>
    <p>But be­cause it is the first, ev­ery­one will rush to get it, even if it is “sub-op­ti­mal”, for the lack of an al­ter­na­tive. Prof Teo fears that this might com­pro­mise the de­vel­op­ment of bet­ter vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, gave an as­sur­ance that there is no fear of that. The pan­demic is so big and af­fects so many coun­tries and peo­ple that there is po­ten­tial for sev­eral vac­cines to be pro­duced and mar­keted, he said. So hav­ing one on the mar­ket will not stop oth­ers from com­plet­ing their de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said a lot of the vac­cine hype is by com­pa­nies con­cerned about their bot­tom lines.</p>
    <p>He wor­ries about the risk in­her­ent in the rush to get a vac­cine out early, as about 130 vac­cines in the pipe­line vie for mar­ket share. Blow­ing their trum­pet at every step helps with the com­pa­nies’ share prices and in get­ting fund­ing for their work.</p>
    <p>But that does not mean the vac­cine will work well.</p>
    <p>“This is what con­cerns me a lot. That there’ll be a de­mand to shorten the phase three tri­als and in­stead of do­ing it on 30,000 peo­ple, you do it on 2,000 peo­ple, rush it through and start pro­duc­ing it. This would be a risk, I would think,” said Prof Fisher, who also chairs the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Global Out­break Alert and Re­sponse Net­work steer­ing com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi, who is lead­ing the de­vel­op­ment of a Covid-19 vac­cine by Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and Amer­i­can medicine com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics, dis­agrees.</p>
    <p>Yes, the de­vel­op­ment time for a new vac­cine has been short­ened from more than a decade to just over a year.</p>
    <p>But re­searchers now “un­der­stand a lot more about the side ef­fects of vac­cines to­day than we did in the past, and a lot of this you can now mea­sure by look­ing at genes, by look­ing at how you re­spond to vac­cines, and that pretty much pre­dicts its safety”, he said.</p>
    <p>He added: “There are a lot of molec­u­lar tools now that weren’t avail­able to us even five years ago that we can now use to eval­u­ate how safe vac­cines could be.”</p>
    <p>Prof Teo and Prof Fisher also dif­fered on the dan­gers of over­seas travel, though both said this is not go­ing to re­sume any time soon.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Teo: “When we go out, we end up be­ing ex­posed to many dif­fer­ent fac­tors that are be­yond our con­trol, and it could hap­pen on the plane, it could hap­pen when I’m at the ho­tel, or it could be at the lo­cal tourist at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>“So even if we do have an ar­range­ment with a part­ner­ing coun­try, per­haps New Zealand, that is con­trol­ling the sit­u­a­tion very well, we have seen how quickly the sit­u­a­tion can change.”</p>
    <p>But Prof Fisher said it need not be that way if coun­tries are good at find­ing cases and quar­an­tin­ing them: “We would be com­fort­able with China be­cause as soon as they get a case, they’re very, very ki­asu.</p>
    <p>“They will lock down the whole area, swab ev­ery­one within a ra­dius. We could be com­fort­able that China is not go­ing to send any (in­fected per­son) to Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>So, what the we­bi­nar showed was that even ex­perts in­ter­pret the same facts dif­fer­ently. Not sur­pris­ing then, that coun­tries are find­ing it so tough to deal with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts say (a vac­cine is) not a magic bul­let. Stay­ing pro­tected re­quires a com­bi­na­tion of a good vac­cine, good treat­ment that re­duces sever­ity of the ill­ness, and good so­cial be­hav­iour... They also agree that there is not go­ing to be a com­mer­cially avail­able vac­cine any time this year. Where they po­litely dif­fer... is whether this rush for a vac­cine is a good thing.</p>
