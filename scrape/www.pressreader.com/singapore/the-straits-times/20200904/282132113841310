    <p>With the con­ven­ing of the new Par­lia­ment, there have been great ex­pec­ta­tions about im­prove­ments in the qual­ity of par­lia­men­tary de­bate. The de­bate so far has not dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>I would like to raise the is­sue of live tele­cast of par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings again. Each time this was brought up, it was dis­missed on grounds of cost, es­pe­cially if an en­tire free-to-air TV chan­nel is de­voted to it.</p>
    <p>A sim­ple al­ter­na­tive would be we­b­casts. We al­ready have OneMo­tor­ing show­ing road cam­eras 24/7, live. I have no doubt that with a small cap­i­tal investment, it is pos­si­ble to in­stall cam­eras in Par­lia­ment that would au­to­mat­i­cally cap­ture the per­son who is speak­ing, es­pe­cially since he or she can do so only at spe­cific mi­cro­phone po­si­tions and must turn on the mi­cro­phone to be heard.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter ac­tion can then trig­ger pre-pro­grammed cam­era set­tings that would cap­ture the speaker, and with the ap­pro­pri­ate rout­ing, the au­dio can be eas­ily in­te­grated into the video.</p>
    <p>All this can then be prop­erly archived as well as streamed live.</p>
    <p>There are sig­nif­i­cant ad­van­tages to a live we­b­cast and pro­vid­ing the record­ing of an en­tire day’s pro­ceed­ings on­line. The most im­por­tant of these would be full trans­parency.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans can view the en­tire process, re­mov­ing any doubt about me­dia bias. Quot­ing min­is­ters or MPs out of con­text on so­cial me­dia would also be a thing of the past. It will also ed­u­cate Sin­ga­pore­ans about our demo­cratic process, and the per­for­mance of the var­i­ous MPs will be open for all to see.</p>
    <p>As we tackle dif­fi­cult questions such as the na­ture of cit­i­zen­ship, race, re­li­gion and so on, the pro­ceed­ings and what our rep­re­sen­ta­tives say in Par­lia­ment will be an im­por­tant in­put in any dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>It is also an im­por­tant way to defini­tively com­bat fake news, thus en­sur­ing that any dis­cus­sion is con­ducted in an open, re­spon­si­ble, con­struc­tive and ob­jec­tive fash­ion.</p>
