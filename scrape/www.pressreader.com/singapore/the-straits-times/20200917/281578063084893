    <p>Thou­sands of evac­uees dis­placed by deadly wild­fires in Ore­gon set­tled into a sec­ond week of life in shel­ters and car camp­ing. Dozens of fires have charred some 1.8 mil­lion ha of tin­der-dry brush, grass and wood­lands in Ore­gon, Cal­i­for­nia and Wash­ing­ton state since Au­gust, rav­aging sev­eral small towns, de­stroy­ing thou­sands of homes and killing at least 34 peo­ple. WORLD</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton DC woke up on Tues­day to a high, thin skin of smoke from wild­fires rag­ing 4,800km away on the West Coast – as if to un­der­line what is at stake when com­plex is­sues are re­duced to over­sim­pli­fied, bi­nary and po­lit­i­cally driven nar­ra­tives.</p>
    <p>Air qual­ity in five ma­jor cities in Ore­gon was rated “haz­ardous” – the worst-ever recorded – in some cases lit­er­ally off the scale al­to­gether, as wild­fires burnt a to­tal of some 1.8 mil­lion hectares as of Tues­day, mostly in Cal­i­for­nia and Ore­gon as well as Wash­ing­ton state and Idaho.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has been em­pha­sis­ing for­est man­age­ment as the root cause of the fires that have swept forests, sub­urbs and small towns, leav­ing at least 34 peo­ple dead.</p>
    <p>And he has been seem­ingly dis­mis­sive of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think science knows, ac­tu­ally,” he said on Mon­day in Cal­i­for­nia. He is deny­ing the role of cli­mate change, comes the counter-cho­rus in a coun­try where the re­sponse to dis­as­ters like the coro­n­avirus and now the wild­fires has been ham­pered by the toxic po­lit­i­cal di­vide.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the Pres­i­dent once called global warm­ing a hoax. On the visit to Cal­i­for­nia, where skies from San Fran­cisco to Los An­ge­les have been an eerie apoc­a­lyp­tic or­ange in re­cent weeks, he told Cal­i­for­nia Nat­u­ral Re­sources Agency head Wade Crow­foot: “It will start get­ting cooler. You just watch.” It was un­clear what he was re­fer­ring to.</p>
    <p>What is cer­tain is that the rea­son the forests are full of tin­der-dry flammable dead wood, brush and leaves is over-man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>An ar­son­ist set­ting fire to a tin­der-dry for­est, a care­less ci­garette, a back­yard bar­be­cue in a high wind or a light­ning strike often sparks a wildfire. And the fires feed on dry trees, branches and leaves.</p>
    <p>Fires are a nat­u­ral part of the cy­cle of cer­tain types of forests.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia and Ore­gon have Mediter­ranean cli­mates and fall in a vul­ner­a­ble cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>But for decades, fires have been sup­pressed as quickly as pos­si­ble to pro­tect tim­ber as­sets, and to pro­tect the phys­i­cal in­fra­struc­tures of hu­man habi­ta­tion – which means un­burnt dry brush and wood lie around and ac­cu­mu­late.</p>
    <p>Re­searcher Kimiko Bar­rett of Head­wa­ters Eco­nomics said: “For a cen­tury and more now, we’ve been in­ten­tion­ally ex­clud­ing wild­fires from the land­scape in the ef­fort to pro­tect homes and com­mu­ni­ties… and in do­ing so, we are ag­gra­vat­ing the prob­lem into the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>While the prox­i­mate causes of wild­fires may be hu­man mis­man­age­ment com­bined with hu­man agency, the un­der­ly­ing rea­sons be­hind the mas­sive wild­fires seen in re­cent years are higher tem­per­a­tures and drought driven by global warm­ing, which ex­plain why this fuel ly­ing around in forests is so tin­der dry.</p>
    <p>After Mon­day’s brief­ing, Mr Crow­foot tweeted a graph show­ing ris­ing tem­per­a­tures in Cal­i­for­nia since the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia Gover­nor Gavin New­som has ac­knowl­edged that “we have not done jus­tice on our for­est man­age­ment” – while point­ing out an irony that more than half of for­est land in Cal­i­for­nia is un­der fed­eral, not state, con­trol.</p>
    <p>“The hots are get­ting hot­ter, the dries are get­ting drier,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We sub­mit the science is in and ob­served ev­i­dence is self-ev­i­dent – that cli­mate change is real and that is ex­ac­er­bat­ing this.”</p>
    <p>But Mr New­som is a Demo­crat. The worst-af­fected states are re­li­ably blue (Demo­crat).</p>
    <p>For dif­fer­ent rea­sons, nei­ther Mr Trump nor his ri­val, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, has much in­cen­tive in tak­ing a strong stand in non-swing states.</p>
    <p>Al­though, on Tues­day, Mr Bi­den made his own fire-and-brim­stone speech at­tack­ing Mr Trump for be­ing a “cli­mate ar­son­ist” in deny­ing cli­mate change, it was from a field in Delaware.</p>
    <p>Both the for­est man­age­ment and cli­mate change ar­gu­ments are cor­rect at the same time.</p>
    <p>But say­ing for­est man­age­ment is to blame is like say­ing a Covid-19 pa­tient died of res­pi­ra­tory fail­ure when it was the coro­n­avirus that caused the res­pi­ra­tory fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Like the coro­n­avirus in Amer­ica, global warm­ing has met ex­actly the con­di­tions for it to feed on and thrive – po­lit­i­cal po­lar­i­sa­tion, science de­nial and hu­man mis­man­age­ment.</p>
