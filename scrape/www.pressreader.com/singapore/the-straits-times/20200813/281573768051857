    <p>An episode in­volv­ing a low-wage el­derly cleaner that went vi­ral has shed light on a prob­lem­atic trend in how we dis­cuss is­sues of in­equal­ity and so­cial hard­ship on pub­lic plat­forms. There are bet­ter ways to dis­cuss poverty, says Yuen Sin (be­low).</p>
    <p>An episode in­volv­ing a low-wage el­derly cleaner that went vi­ral last month has shed light on a prob­lem­atic trend in how we dis­cuss is­sues of in­equal­ity and so­cial hard­ship on pub­lic plat­forms.</p>
    <p>If this con­tin­ues, it can lead to con­se­quences for all par­ties in­volved, par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble groups. The in­ci­dent has also sparked dis­cus­sion on how Sin­ga­pore­ans can dis­cuss is­sues on poverty and share sto­ries of the vul­ner­a­ble in a more re­spon­si­ble man­ner.</p>
    <p>What hap­pened was this: Last month, a young man met an el­derly cleaner, who told him that her wages are in­suf­fi­cient for her needs, and that she had lost her hus­band and only son.</p>
    <p>He turned to In­sta­gram and posted a story with pho­tos of her, which gave de­tails of how much she said she was be­ing paid, where her work­place is, and the town where she lives.</p>
    <p>He went on to sug­gest that the pro­gres­sive wage model – a wage ladder that spec­i­fies higher pay for work­ers as they up­grade their skills – is not work­ing, among other things.</p>
    <p>The post was widely shared and went vi­ral. Some con­cerned mem­bers of the pub­lic sought the woman out at her work­place, and even man­aged to trace her to her home, though the young man did not re­veal her ad­dress.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) later clar­i­fied de­tails about the woman’s cir­cum­stances in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>It gave more in­for­ma­tion on the wages that she was ac­tu­ally re­ceiv­ing and how her salary had been af­fected by the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion. It also gave de­tails about her hous­ing and fam­ily sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>It also listed the var­i­ous forms of fi­nan­cial sup­port that she will be re­ceiv­ing as a per­ma­nent res­i­dent, in­clud­ing monthly $120 food vouch­ers for the next six months.</p>
    <p>MSF also said the woman “in­di­cated she was un­aware of be­ing pho­tographed or that her com­ments and photo would be shared in pub­lic on so­cial me­dia”.</p>
    <p>The woman later told the young man she was “very stressed” by the un­wanted at­ten­tion re­ceived, ac­cord­ing to an­other Face­book post he put up. He also said he apol­o­gised to her, and took down his orig­i­nal In­sta­gram post.</p>
    <p>In­ci­dents like these are not new; as far back as 2013, on­line posts about in­di­vid­u­als fac­ing hard­ship have at­tracted scru­tiny. They play out in a sim­i­lar tra­jec­tory. Some­one meets a poor or vul­ner­a­ble per­son, talks to the in­di­vid­ual and posts a story on­line. Af­ter at­tract­ing pub­lic sym­pa­thy, the story goes vi­ral. The au­thor­i­ties then rush to in­ves­ti­gate the mat­ter and is­sue a pub­lic clar­i­fi­ca­tion, if de­tails of the orig­i­nal post were in­ac­cu­rate or if it has sparked dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>THE DAN­GER OF RE­LY­ING ON A SIN­GLE STORY</p>
    <p>Per­sonal anec­dotes and sto­ries help peo­ple de­velop un­der­stand­ing of and em­pa­thy for so­cial is­sues. But it is prob­lem­atic to rely on a sin­gle anec­dote to make sweep­ing gen­er­al­i­sa­tions about Sin­ga­pore’s so­cial poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the ex­is­tence of peo­ple who need help or fall through the cracks is not ev­i­dence of sys­temic fail­ure on the part of the Govern­ment, though there is cer­tainly room for poli­cies to evolve.</p>
    <p>In the re­cent case and other sim­i­lar episodes in the past, vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als whose de­tails are shared on­line in­vol­un­tar­ily get caught in the cross­fire be­tween vo­cif­er­ous ne­ti­zens, who crit­i­cise the Govern­ment af­ter read­ing the story, and pub­lic agen­cies, which want to clar­ify facts to de­fend them­selves.</p>
    <p>Their pri­vacy may end up be­ing sac­ri­ficed as a re­sult, as var­i­ous par­ties share, de­bate and scru­ti­nise de­tails about them re­leased on­line. Yet oth­ers may ques­tion their mo­tives, pro­nounce judg­ment or make den­i­gra­tory re­marks.</p>
    <p>Such episodes also af­fect so­cial work­ers, said Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin, a for­mer min­is­ter for so­cial and fam­ily de­vel­op­ment. “It makes it sound as if the so­cial work­ers work­ing with the in­di­vid­ual have been fail­ing in their job. But he or she may ac­tu­ally be re­ceiv­ing help, and it’s very de­mor­al­is­ing for so­cial work­ers work­ing on the case.”</p>
    <p>The prob­lem with spot­light­ing a vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­ual in this man­ner is that peo­ple may gen­er­alise from one anec­dote to a cri­tique of an en­tire sys­tem. Such dis­cus­sions are not very help­ful.</p>
    <p>HOW TO TALK ABOUT POVERTY BET­TER</p>
    <p>This is not to say one should not dis­cuss poverty in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Poverty ex­ists in ev­ery so­ci­ety and is­sues around poverty and in­equal­ity have been dis­cussed and de­bated openly in re­cent years in Sin­ga­pore. The Covid-19 cri­sis, too, has sparked mean­ing­ful con­ver­sa­tions about how to raise wages for es­sen­tial ser­vices work­ers. Many are also moved to help those in hard­ship. Such en­er­gies can be tapped to de­velop a com­pas­sion­ate, grounded re­sponse to so­cial needs, with­out re­sort­ing to fin­ger-point­ing.</p>
    <p>As a so­ci­ety, we can also de­velop a more con­struc­tive and thought­ful way of dis­cussing poverty that does not ex­pose vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple to more harm.</p>
    <p>SEEK CON­SENT AND DO NO HARM</p>
    <p>So­cial work spe­cial­ists say the first rule of thumb is to get per­mis­sion be­fore writ­ing or post­ing about a per­son.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwan Jin Yao, a so­cial wel­fare PhD can­di­date at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les, said such in­formed con­sent means the per­son must know how his in­for­ma­tion or ex­pe­ri­ence is be­ing shared, and un­der­stands the risks and ben­e­fits of do­ing so.</p>
    <p>But it is not enough to stop at that, as the vul­ner­a­ble back­ground of the in­di­vid­ual also has to be con­sid­ered, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Irene Ng of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) de­part­ment of so­cial work said: “Espe­cially with lower-in­come in­di­vid­u­als who de­pend on for­mal as­sis­tance and good­will do­na­tions, con­sent is given un­der un­bal­anced power dy­nam­ics and pres­sure from a sense of obli­ga­tion.”</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als in need who have opened up in a mo­ment about their vul­ner­a­bil­ity may not fully un­der­stand the reach and risks of so­cial me­dia. “As a so­ci­ety, we need to draw up rules of en­gage­ment as so­cial me­dia be­comes the norm for in­for­ma­tion trans­mis­sion and solic­i­ta­tion of help,” said Prof Ng, adding that vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple should be con­sulted in de­vel­op­ing such a frame­work.</p>
    <p>So­cial worker T. Ran­ganayaki, who is deputy ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Be­yond So­cial Ser­vices, said telling sto­ries of peo­ple in need can help raise aware­ness of so­cial is­sues. But such sto­ries must re­spect the vul­ner­a­ble per­son’s pri­vacy and not re­veal iden­ti­fy­ing in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Act, for ex­am­ple, pro­hibits the pub­li­ca­tion of a per­son’s name, NRIC or ad­dress, among other de­tails that can iden­tify a per­son.</p>
    <p>But even if the law is fol­lowed, those post­ing should ad­here to a higher stan­dard: Do no harm.</p>
    <p>“We must also be clear on the pur­pose for shar­ing, and that it does not do more harm such as (putting) fur­ther strain on al­ready strained re­la­tion­ships, caus­ing is­sues at the work­place, cre­at­ing un­nec­es­sary stress, and so on,” Ms Ran­ganayaki said.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail re­sponse to ques­tions from The Straits Times on this is­sue, the MSF said that it “ap­pre­ci­ates the ef­forts by mem­bers of the pub­lic in look­ing out for those in need”, but added: “We dis­cour­age post­ing the per­sonal cir­cum­stances and de­tails of in­di­vid­u­als on so­cial me­dia. Well-mean­ing mem­bers of pub­lic may seek out these vul­ner­a­ble groups of peo­ple and their fam­i­lies... to help them, but in­ad­ver­tently cause fur­ther dis­tress to them by post­ing their pho­tos and per­sonal iden­ti­fi­able de­tails on­line.”</p>
    <p>Such posts may also not re­flect the full ex­tent of help that some­one is get­ting. In­stead, those who wish to help can direct those in need to the so­cial ser­vice of­fices or fam­ily ser­vice cen­tres, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng Kok Hoe, a se­nior re­search fel­low at NUS’ Lee Kuan Yew</p>
    <p>School of Pub­lic Pol­icy, said there is a need to look be­yond sto­ries about in­di­vid­ual ex­pe­ri­ences to re­flect on the sys­tems be­hind them.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus on sto­ries may re­veal a ten­dency on the part of some to “in­di­vid­u­alise or pri­va­tise so­cial is­sues, to place the fo­cus on cases that can be re­solved by mak­ing re­fer­rals and ty­ing up loose ends”, he noted.</p>
    <p>But there is also a “need to step back and look at the un­der­ly­ing sys­temic prob­lems, like low wages, in­se­cure work and old-age poverty”. He added: “Un­til we ad­dress those prob­lems, we will keep see­ing new cases and new sto­ries of hard­ship.”</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts in­ter­viewed also high­light that the au­thor­i­ties too must safe­guard the dig­nity of the vul­ner­a­ble per­son be­ing spot­lighted.</p>
    <p>Dr Natalie Pang, a se­nior lec­turer in NUS’ com­mu­ni­ca­tions and new me­dia de­part­ment, said: “As a min­istry that is trusted to have all the rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion about the case, they could ex­plore pub­licly clar­i­fy­ing or cor­rect­ing cer­tain de­tails, while stat­ing why they are with­hold­ing other in­for­ma­tion, if need be.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, it is about eth­i­cal dis­cre­tion to pro­tect the pri­vacy and dig­nity of in­di­vid­u­als, espe­cially those who are more vul­ner­a­ble and the peo­ple around them.”</p>
    <p>On this point, MSF said: “In cases of pub­lic in­ter­est, the law per­mits the dis­clo­sure of spe­cific per­sonal in­for­ma­tion, to pre­serve the pub­lic’s trust in pub­lic agen­cies, and to en­sure that peo­ple are not mis­led. It is also im­por­tant to pro­vide a cor­rect rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the sit­u­a­tion, so that mem­bers of pub­lic do not of­fer fi­nan­cial and other forms of help with­out a clear un­der­stand­ing of an in­di­vid­ual’s sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Where such posts with in­ac­cu­rate or in­com­plete in­for­ma­tion ap­pear, the min­istry will work with agen­cies and part­ners “to cor­rect any mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tions of the sit­u­a­tion while seek­ing to safe­guard the pri­vacy of (its) clients”, it said.</p>
    <p>De­tails are re­vealed where needed to cor­rect any mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion in posts by the pub­lic, said MSF. In the case of the el­derly cleaner, MSF of­fi­cers had also vis­ited her to as­sess if she needed any help and sup­port.</p>
    <p>Un­like govern­ment of­fi­cials, so­cial work­ers do not have the am­bit to dis­close per­sonal in­for­ma­tion of their clients pub­licly. The Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of So­cial Work­ers’ (SASW) code of ethics states that so­cial work­ers should “re­spect and safe­guard the pri­vacy and con­fi­den­tial­ity of clients by us­ing in­for­ma­tion given and re­ceived re­spon­si­bly”. It also says they should not dis­cuss or talk about their clients out­side the pro­fes­sional con­text and in pub­lic spa­ces and ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Among those in­ter­viewed, some felt the MSF could have at­tended to the cleaner’s case and cor­rected de­tails with­out re­veal­ing so much about her spe­cific cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Given the dif­fer­ence in views on such cases, it might be worth­while for the MSF, the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice and the SASW to come to a com­mon un­der­stand­ing of how they can pro­tect the con­fi­den­tial­ity of vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als when their sto­ries are made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, whether it is a well-mean­ing cit­i­zen moved to tell a marginalis­ed per­son’s story, a ca­sual reader who wants to help, a so­cial worker who is al­ready in­volved, or an of­fi­cial from the rel­e­vant min­istry – each party is ul­ti­mately try­ing to do his part to re­duce the suf­fer­ing of those in need and help meet their needs.</p>
    <p>But this has to be done in a way that is sen­si­tive to the needs of the vul­ner­a­ble per­son, and not turn him into an ob­ject of pity or con­tention.</p>
    <p>As Ms Ran­ganayaki said: “It’s all our re­spon­si­bil­ity to safe­guard the dig­nity of the most vul­ner­a­ble.”</p>
