    <p>New store own­ers have suf­fered the brunt of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Nur Haryani Ja­malud­din, 32, said the Govern­ment en­forced the cir­cuit breaker j ust be­fore she opened a bou­tique on the sec­ond floor of Tan­jong Ka­tong Com­plex. Like other busi­nesses, she has tried to spur sales by go­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>One shop­keeper, who did not want to be iden­ti­fied, told The Straits Times that the eas­ing of re­stric­tions at Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket has brought back some cus­tomers to the nearby shop­ping com­plexes.</p>
    <p>Week­day en­try re­stric­tions to the mar­ket were eased last Thurs­day af­ter the au­thor­i­ties noted a re­duc­tion in week­day queues.</p>
    <p>It was one of four pop­u­lar wet mar­kets where en­try was re­stricted based on the last digit of a shop­per’s NRIC num­ber.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket, which wit­nessed long queues ahead of Hari Raya Aidil­fitri in May, was on the Min­istry of Health’s list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients in early June.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are set to en­joy faster 5G speeds for the first time, with StarHub launch­ing early-stage 5G ser­vices to­day.</p>
    <p>The six-month trial is open to con­sumers who have signed up for StarHub’s three Mo­bile+ plans and own a 5G-en­abled phone.</p>
    <p>But con­sumers are not get­ting the full 5G ex­pe­ri­ence yet, as Sin­ga­pore’s two planned na­tion­wide 5G net­works are still some way from com­ple­tion.</p>
    <p>In­stead, StarHub’s trial taps ex­ist­ing 4G net­works to of­fer some ben­e­fits of 5G, such as in­creased speeds.</p>
    <p>The na­tion­wide 5G net­works, which will be ready in 2025, will of­fer the full suite of 5G ben­e­fits, such as much lower la­tency, the abil­ity to connect many more devices, and a fur­ther boost to net­work speeds.</p>
    <p>StarHub said yes­ter­day that mo­bile down­load speeds will range from 100Mbps to 660Mbps to be­gin with, and will in­crease over the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, 4G down­load speeds on Sing­tel and StarHub av­er­aged around 58Mbps, ac­cord­ing to mo­bile an­a­lyt­ics com­pany Opensignal’s June re­port.</p>
    <p>StarHub said its 5G sig­nals cur­rently cover 53 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­lated ar­eas and will reach 70 per cent by next month. Among the ar­eas now cov­ered are the Cen­tral Busi­ness District as well as res­i­den­tial districts such as Jurong East, Tampines and Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>“We are ea­ger for our cus­tomers to catch an early glimpse into the (5G) up­grades that will em­power hun­dreds of thou­sands of con­sumers, en­ter­prises (and) govern­ment clients in Sin­ga­pore,” said StarHub’s con­sumer busi­ness group chief Jo­han Buse.</p>
    <p>StarHub’s two-year Mo­bile+ plans cost from $65 to $155 a month, de­pend­ing on how much mo­bile data the user wants.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses can also get access to StarHub’s 5G ser­vices by sign­ing up for the telco’s Biz+ plans which come in two-year, SIM-only one-year and SIM-only no­con­tract vari­ants.</p>
    <p>For now, the only two phone mod­els that are 5G-en­abled are the Huawei P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ 5G, but more will fol­low in the next three months, StarHub said.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers on Sam­sung’s Galaxy S20 Ul­tra 5G, Note20 5G and Note20 Ul­tra 5G can ex­pect to re­ceive 5G soft­ware updates from Sam­sung in phases start­ing from the end of this month, StarHub said, while users of the Oppo X2 Pro can ex­pect the same from end-Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The I nfo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Author­ity (IMDA) gave the green light for tel­cos to launch ser­vices with early 5G ben­e­fits yes­ter­day, and said it is work­ing with them to en­sure a smooth tran­si­tion to the na­tion­wide net­works when those are ready in 2025.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel and a joint ven­ture be­tween StarHub and M1 won the rights to build the two net­works ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>IMDA chief ex­ec­u­tive Lew Chuen Hong said “good progress” has been made on the jour­ney to roll out the full-fledged 5G net­works.</p>
    <p>“We wel­come and are sup­port­ive of our op­er­a­tors’ in­ter­est to make in­cre­men­tal in­vest­ment in the mean­time... to of­fer their cus­tomers some early 5G ben­e­fits such as a faster mo­bile broad­band ex­pe­ri­ence,” Mr Lew said.</p>
    <p>M1 said it is work­ing closely with the IMDA to of­fer cus­tomers early 5G ben­e­fits, and that its net­work is “launch-ready”.</p>
    <p>“We will pro­vide more details when we of­fi­cially launch the net­work,” its spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a Sing­tel spokesman said the telco is gear­ing up for the launch of its 5G com­mer­cial ser­vices soon, and cus­tomers can ex­pe­ri­ence 5G at its pop-up store in Our Tampines Hub.</p>
    <p>Reach of StarHub’s 5G sig­nals by next month, from 53 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­lated ar­eas cur­rently. Among the ar­eas now cov­ered are the Cen­tral Busi­ness District as well as res­i­den­tial districts such as Jurong East, Tampines and Wood­lands.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Joo Chiat Com&#xAD;plex, which is usu&#xAD;ally crowded dur&#xAD;ing the week&#xAD;ends, has been un&#xAD;usu&#xAD;ally quiet dur&#xAD;ing the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus pan&#xAD;demic. Shop&#xAD;keep&#xAD;ers said that un&#xAD;less the sit&#xAD;u&#xAD;a&#xAD;tion changes, it would be dif&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cult to main&#xAD;tain their busi&#xAD;nesses.</p>
