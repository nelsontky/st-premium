    <p>SEOUL • When Ryu Sera made her de­but with K-pop girl band Nine Muses, the years of in­tense train­ing and ruth­less com­pe­ti­tion seemed worth­while, her dreams of star­dom fi­nally com­ing true.</p>
    <p>A few top 10 sin­gles fol­lowed, but within four years, she had been cast on the K-pop scrapheap, sacked by her man­age­ment firm as it reshuf­fled the band’s line-up.</p>
    <p>An at­tempted solo ca­reer foundered and she was left in debt, bat­tling de­pres­sion and contemplat­ing sui­cide.</p>
    <p>But six years af­ter her dis­missal, she has been given a se­cond chance on a groundbrea­king new tele­vi­sion show for failed and for­mer idols – and is speak­ing out against a struc­ture that con­sumes young hope­fuls with only a tiny mi­nor­ity sur­viv­ing to star­dom.</p>
    <p>“The K-pop i ndus­try has a fac­tory-like mass-pro­duc­tion sys­tem,” she said.</p>
    <p>K-pop is the lat­est and big­gest in­stance of the so-called Korean Wave, as South Korea’s pop­u­lar cul­ture gains over­seas recog­ni­tion – epit­o­mised by the global suc­cess of boy­band BTS, who topped the US Bill­board sin­gles chart this year.</p>
    <p>The phe­nom­e­non earns bil­lions of dol­lars for the world’s 12thlarges­t econ­omy and scores of groups are launched each year to try to cap­ture a slice of the pie.</p>
    <p>Un­like many groups else­where, K-pop bands are not nor­mally formed by the mem­bers them­selves who then try to se­cure a record deal, but are in­stead usu­ally as­sem­bled by their man­ag­ing agen­cies. They put the mem­bers through in­ten­sive train­ing pro­grammes and con­trol ev­ery­thing from their mu­sic and lyrics to their looks and many as­pects of their daily lives.</p>
    <p>But most acts quickly dis­ap­pear, leav­ing barely a trace on the score of mu­si­cal his­tory.</p>
    <p>‘LIKE AN AD­DICT’</p>
    <p>Ryu was 22 when she passed an au­di­tion to be­come a trainee with Star Em­pire, a medium-sized agency in Seoul.</p>
    <p>She was among 40 to 50 con­tenders for a place in Nine Muses.</p>
    <p>“It was an end­less con­test with tests ev­ery week and those who ranked bot­tom on danc­ing, singing skills and looks were kicked out, ” she said.</p>
    <p>At first, she of­ten scored poorly for danc­ing and singing, but she “prac­tised like an ad­dict”, she added.</p>
    <p>A year later, she was cho­sen to be Nine Muses’ lead singer.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter their de­but, there was no let-up in the reg­i­men, and she was sub­jected to con­stant re­views, of­ten crit­i­cal, of her ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>“Man­agers would say things like, ‘Why are you so fat?’... be­cause I did not fall into their cat­e­gory of el­e­gant, sexy women,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I doubt they are even aware that they hurt me with their words.”</p>
    <p>When her con­tract came up for re­newal, she de­manded that the Nine Muses mem­bers take part in ev­ery con­cept meet­ing, that they would have con­trol over what clothes they wore and that no more mem­bers would be re­placed.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­ers did not of­fer her a new deal.</p>
    <p>“There are so many trainees, so many artists, so many young peo­ple who want to get into this in­dus­try,” she said. “So, they some­times con­sider us re­place­able prod­ucts.”</p>
    <p>A Star Em­pire rep­re­sen­ta­tive said the firm and Ryu had been “un­able to agree on new con­tract terms”, adding: “We wish her all the best.”</p>
    <p>ILL­NESS AND SHAME</p>
    <p>In an at­tempt to build a solo ca­reer, Ryu bor­rowed money to pro­duce her own al­bums and put on con­certs, but with­out the back­ing of a ma­jor agency, none of them gen­er­ated a profit.</p>
    <p>“I felt like I had ac­com­plished noth­ing and was be­ing for­got­ten,” she said.</p>
    <p>South Korea is an in­tensely com­pet­i­tive so­ci­ety and has an un­usu­ally high sui­cide rate, with re­cent celebrity deaths in­clud­ing singers Goo Hara and Sulli, both of whom had been sub­jected to vi­cious cy­ber bul­ly­ing, and Kim Jong-hyun of the boy band Shi­nee.</p>
    <p>Ryu also con­sid­ered killing her­self. “There are very, very fa­mous peo­ple who chose to end their lives,” she said. “When I was re­ally de­pressed, I thought about the worst thing.”</p>
    <p>She has been on med­i­ca­tion since she was di­ag­nosed with de­pres­sion last year.</p>
    <p>Count­less teenagers flock to en­ter­tain­ment agen­cies as­pir­ing to be­come stars, but no one looks af­ter those who do not make the cut, she said, or those who de­but but are re­placed soon af­ter­wards by younger ri­vals.</p>
    <p>“In the K-pop in­dus­try, we don’t take men­tal health se­ri­ously. When you are men­tally ill, you im­me­di­ately feel ashamed.”</p>
    <p>MISS BACK</p>
    <p>More than a decade since pass­ing the Star Em­pire au­di­tion, Ryu is com­pet­ing again in a new tele­vi­sion show, Miss Back.</p>
    <p>Hosted by K-pop queen Baek Jiy­oung, who has eight stu­dio al­bums un­der her belt in a ca­reer still go­ing strong af­ter 21 years, it of­fers for­mer fe­male idols a new show­case – some who never made it and others who were once fa­mous but then faded away.</p>
    <p>Around 200 were in­ter­viewed for only seven slots on the pro­gramme. But among the cho­sen few, no one will be elim­i­nated.</p>
    <p>Each week, all seven per­form the same song and the one the judges score high­est is re­leased as a sin­gle, with the per­former shar­ing in the prof­its.</p>
    <p>In the process, the cast mem­bers share the pains and strug­gles they en­dured in the hid­den shad­ows of the glam­orous in­dus­try. And there will be no over­all win­ner.</p>
    <p>“This pro­gramme is like ther­apy for wounded sol­diers,” said Ryu.</p>
