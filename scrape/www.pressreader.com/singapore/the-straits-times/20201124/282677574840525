    <p>TAIPEI • Tai­wanese singer Vi­vian Hsu has re­acted to crit­i­cism of her be­hav­iour at Tai­wan’s Golden Horse Awards last Saturday.</p>
    <p>Hsu was on stage with vet­eran ac­tor Tsai Chen-nan to present the awards for Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress and Best Cin­e­matog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>Hsu, 45, is also a pro­ducer and ac­tress in the movie Lit­tle Big Women, which was nom­i­nated for six awards, in­clud­ing Best Lead­ing Ac­tress for Chen Shu-fang and Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress for Hsieh Ying-xuan.</p>
    <p>Chen was also nom­i­nated for Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress for an­other movie, Dear Ten­ant.</p>
    <p>Hsu seemed to be more ner­vous than the nom­i­nees be­fore an­nounc­ing the win­ner for Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress.</p>
    <p>She said she hoped Hsieh would win the award, which some took as a sign of dis­re­spect for the other four nom­i­nees.</p>
    <p>Hsu then opened the en­ve­lope for the win­ner of Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress, but said she did not dare look at it and handed it to Tsai.</p>
    <p>He was about to an­nounce the win­ner when she took the en­ve­lope back, looked at it and an­nounced that Chen had won for Dear Ten­ant.</p>
    <p>The whole process dragged on for about five min­utes. There were strong re­ac­tions from ne­ti­zens, who slammed Hsu for be­ing “rude”, “try­ing too hard to be hu­mor­ous” and “talk­ing too much”.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the on­line brick­bats, Hsu wrote a post late last Saturday.</p>
    <p>She said in Chi­nese: “Be­ing a pro­ducer for the first time, I tried to do my best. I was also a lit­tle bit ex­cited and ner­vous as I tried to en­liven the pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>“Please for­give me if there are im­per­fec­tions and thanks for all the crit­i­cism and ad­vice. Thanks to Brother Nan for the won­der­ful sen­tence.”</p>
    <p>Tsai had said be­fore Hsu an­nounced the win­ner that no one would re­mem­ber the win­ners one week af­ter the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Chen also won Best Lead­ing Ac­tress last Saturday.</p>
