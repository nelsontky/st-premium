    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions were launched into 37 peo­ple, and 16 for­eign­ers among them have been de­ported, as Sin­ga­pore went on height­ened se­cu­rity alert in the wake of re­cent ter­ror at­tacks in France.</p>
    <p>A rad­i­calised 26-year-old Bangladesh­i con­struc­tion worker was also ar­rested un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act on Nov 2 while be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for ter­ror-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity ac­tiv­i­ties were stepped up af­ter French magazine Char­lie Hebdo re­pub­lished car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Muham­mad on Sept 1, re­sult­ing in a spate of ter­ror­ist at­tacks in France – in­clud­ing the be­head­ing of French school­teacher Sa­muel Paty in a Paris sub­urb.</p>
    <p>“In view of the de­te­ri­o­rat­ing se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion, the Home Team has been on height­ened alert since early Septem­ber and had also stepped up its se­cu­rity ac­tiv­i­ties to pre-empt copy­cat at­tacks in Sin­ga­pore,” said the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, in­ves­ti­ga­tions were ini­ti­ated into 14 Sin­ga­pore­ans and 23 for­eign­ers for sus­pected rad­i­cal in­cli­na­tions, or for mak­ing com­ments that could in­cite vi­o­lence or stoke com­mu­nal un­rest.</p>
    <p>Most had sup­ported the be­head­ing of Mr Paty and the sub­se­quent at­tacks in France and else­where. Some had in­cited vi­o­lence against French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, who had de­fended the car­toons. A few made deroga­tory com­ments against Mus­lims, said MHA.</p>
    <p>Six­teen for­eign­ers – 15 Bangladesh­is and one Malaysian – were repa­tri­ated af­ter the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity De­part­ment com­pleted in­ves­ti­ga­tions into them. Most of the 15 Bangladesh­is were work­ing in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try and had in­cited vi­o­lence against France in so­cial me­dia post­ings.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing seven for­eign­ers are still be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>The MHA said there was no in­di­ca­tion that any of these in­di­vid­u­als had planned any at­tacks or protests in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As for the 14 Sin­ga­pore­ans, they hold a va­ri­ety of oc­cu­pa­tions, are aged be­tween 19 and 62, and in­clude four women. They are still be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>“Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions have not sur­faced any in­di­ca­tion that they pose an im­mi­nent ter­ror­ism threat,” said an MHA spokesman.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a Religious Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Group sem­i­nar yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam said car­toons like the ones Char­lie Hebdo pub­lished would never have been al­lowed in Sin­ga­pore. “If you did this in Sin­ga­pore, we would ar­rest you,” he said.</p>
    <p>He said that while both France and Sin­ga­pore guar­an­tee free­dom of re­li­gion, the ap­proaches they take are dif­fer­ent. “France says they pre­fer to achieve it by tak­ing a hands-off ap­proach; we are in­ter­ven­tion­ist. We in­ter­vene. Be­cause we take the po­si­tion that the right to speak freely goes with the duty to act re­spon­si­bly.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment here does not al­low any religious group to be at­tacked or in­sulted, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Paty, 47, was be­headed af­ter he showed the car­toons to his teenage stu­dents in a les­son on free speech. Some of those in­ves­ti­gated sup­ported his be­head­ing.</p>
    <p>As the Home Team swung into ac­tion, its in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that Ahmed Faysal, the ar­rested Bangladesh­i, had be­come rad­i­calised and wanted to take up arms to sup­port his re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam told re­porters that the com­mu­nity must help counter such on­line rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion and religious lead­ers must ex­plain what ev­ery re­li­gion is about.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, whether you’re Chris­tian, Mus­lim, Hindu, Taoist, or of other re­li­gions, ev­ery­one, I think, un­der­stands and pro­motes har­mony and peace,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) may have lost its phys­i­cal ter­ri­tory, but its vi­o­lent ide­ol­ogy con­tin­ues to spread and its sup­port­ers are quick to cap­i­talise on cur­rent events to fur­ther their agenda, Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>To pro­tect Sin­ga­pore against ex­trem­ism and ter­ror­ism, calm and cred­i­ble voices are needed to lower tem­per­a­tures and drown out hate speech, he added.</p>
    <p>He held up the Religious Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Group (RRG) for swiftly con­demn­ing acts of vi­o­lence and urg­ing peo­ple not to play into the hands of ex­trem­ists, af­ter the be­head­ing of a French teacher in a Paris sub­urb on Oct 16.</p>
    <p>Some, in their ca­pac­i­ties as asati­zah (religious teach­ers), also posted on their per­sonal so­cial me­dia ac­counts, re­mind­ing the com­mu­nity of the need to prac­tise mu­tual re­spect, love and com­pas­sion, said Mr Shan­mugam in his speech at an RRG sem­i­nar at Khadi­jah Mosque in Gey­lang.</p>
    <p>“Those sorts of strong, clear re­sponses were im­por­tant in set­ting the tone for our com­mu­nity, and this is some­thing that the Gov­ern­ment wel­comes,” he added.</p>
    <p>French teacher Sa­muel Paty had shown his stu­dents car­i­ca­tures de­pict­ing Prophet Mo­ham­mad dur­ing a class on free speech and he was killed by an 18-year-old Mus­lim Rus­sian refugee. The in­ci­dent reignited de­bate in France on free­dom of ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam’s speech yes­ter­day co­in­cided with the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs’ an­nounce­ment that 37 peo­ple have been in­ves­ti­gated and 16 of them repa­tri­ated as part of a height­ened se­cu­rity ef­fort since Septem­ber. They caught the at­ten­tion of the au­thor­i­ties for sus­pected rad­i­cal in­cli­na­tions, or for mak­ing com­ments which in­cite vi­o­lence or stoke com­mu­nal un­rest.</p>
    <p>A vir­tual tour of the RRG’s Re­source and Coun­selling Cen­tre was launched by the min­is­ter dur­ing the event, which was also at­tended by Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim, Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir and Is­lamic Religious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Esa Ma­sood.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Shan­mugam said ISIS re­mains a threat, and its pro­pa­ganda on so­cial me­dia con­tin­ues to rad­i­calise in­di­vid­u­als and in­spire at­tacks around the world, in­clud­ing South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Sus­tained counter-ter­ror­ism ef­forts in the re­gion have led to a dip in the num­ber of at­tacks, but re­gional ter­ror­ists are adapt­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, they have di­ver­si­fied the way they carry out their at­tacks, favour­ing the use of crude weaponry such as knives and lesser-known ex­plo­sives, as well as tap­ping al­ter­na­tive fund­ing sources for their oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Rad­i­cals have jumped on French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s de­fence of the right to re­pub­lish car­toons of Prophet Mo­ham­mad, and called on fol­low­ers to make re­tal­ia­tory at­tacks against those who in­sult Is­lam, Mr Shan­mugam noted.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter stressed these rad­i­cals do not rep­re­sent Is­lam, and that such peo­ple who ad­vo­cate vi­o­lence are present in any re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>He said the ar­rest of Bangladesh­i con­struc­tion worker Ahmed Faysal un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act on Nov 2 and the repa­tri­a­tion of 15 Bangladesh­is and one Malaysian shows Sin­ga­pore’s “zero-tol­er­ance ap­proach”.</p>
    <p>But the Gov­ern­ment alone can­not pro­tect Sin­ga­pore against ex­trem­ism and ter­ror­ism. It takes a whole-of-so­ci­ety ef­fort, he added.</p>
    <p>The RRG’s work is even more im­por­tant now as more peo­ple are spend­ing their time on­line, he said.</p>
    <p>The group, which trains religious teach­ers to coun­sel those who have been in­flu­enced or mis­guided by rad­i­cal teach­ings, has in­ten­si­fied its ef­forts to reach out to the com­mu­nity on­line, with ar­ti­cles and on­line lec­tures, said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>There are also plans to ex­pand its re­source cen­tre, he added.</p>
