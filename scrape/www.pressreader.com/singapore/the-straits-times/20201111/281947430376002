    <p>Keep­ing the vir­tu­ous cy­cle of good gov­er­nance and sta­bil­ity go­ing is cru­cial for the con­tin­ued progress of Sin­ga­pore. In or­der to do so, the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) lead­er­ship has made clear that the party must be re­spon­sive to pop­u­lar sen­ti­ments that de­sire greater di­ver­sity of po­lit­i­cal views and al­ter­na­tive poli­cies. These need to be ar­tic­u­lated co­gently and de­bated thor­oughly in Par­lia­ment. Clearly, the choice is not be­tween sta­bil­ity and democ­racy. It rests on an evolv­ing vi­sion of pol­i­tics in which the recog­ni­tion and in­cor­po­ra­tion of di­ver­sity un­der­pin strong and ef­fec­tive gov­er­nance. The stakes are na­tional and not par­ti­san be­cause once the cy­cle is bro­ken, it would be dif­fi­cult to re­store it. The</p>
    <p>PAP con­fer­ence on Sun­day pro­vided a brac­ing re­minder of the need to pre­serve con­ti­nu­ity by be­ing pre­pared for change.</p>
    <p>Con­ti­nu­ity takes the form of Sin­ga­pore es­chew­ing the kind of ad­ver­sar­ial po­lit­i­cal con­tes­ta­tion ev­i­dent else­where, in which rulers cling to power in the short term and chal­lengers seek to re­place them by tempt­ing the pop­u­lace with equally short-term poli­cies and pro­grammes with­out due care to the at­ten­dant costs, which be­come ap­par­ent only when the chal­lengers come to power. Then, a vi­cious cir­cle be­gins as con­tend­ing po­lit­i­cal elites com­pete for votes by reach­ing out to the low­est com­mon de­nom­i­na­tor of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The dan­ger lies in dis­il­lu­sioned vot­ers form­ing such a large part of the elec­torate in the im­me­di­ate term that they skew elec­toral re­sults to harm ev­ery­one in the long term. The Trump as­cen­dancy in the United States, which fu­elled it­self on the in­stincts of its sup­port­ers, demon­strated just how dan­ger­ous pop­ulist dem­a­goguery can be even in a coun­try that de­fines it­self by the qual­ity of its demo­cratic life. Pop­ulism, par­tic­u­larly when it sharp­ens around an eth­nic, na­tion­al­ist or class edge, is a blight that Sin­ga­pore can ill af­ford. The elec­toral re­treat of pop­ulism in the US with the elec­tion of a new ad­min­is­tra­tion this month pro­vides no guar­an­tee that re­ver­sals can be so dra­matic.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment here must con­tinue to be at­ten­tive to the shift­ing moods of vot­ers even as it leads Sin­ga­pore out of one of the most chal­leng­ing pe­ri­ods of its in­de­pen­dent his­tory. Un­like the time when the lib­eral class sought po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity and the work­ing class looked for sta­bil­ity, the de­sire for more po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity has bread-and­but­ter is­sues at its root now.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic af­ter­math of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic prom­ises to be longer and more puni­tive than the ex­pe­ri­ence of Covid-19 it­self. Job losses, re­duced in­comes and de­flated ex­pec­ta­tions will ex­act a price on the liv­ing stan­dards that most Sin­ga­pore­ans take for granted. Manag­ing the tran­si­tion to the new nor­mal re­quires close and con­stant en­gage­ment.</p>
