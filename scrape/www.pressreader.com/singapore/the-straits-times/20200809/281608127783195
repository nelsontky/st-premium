    <p>The Min­istry of Trans­port and the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) will work with Bukit Pan­jang MP Liang Eng Hwa and Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC MP Ed­ward Chia over the Na­tional Day week­end to ex­plore op­tions to mit­i­gate the im­pact of changes to three bus ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Chee Hong Tat gave this up­date in a Face­book post yesterday af­ter meet­ing both MPs to dis­cuss the planned changes to ser­vices 171, 700 and 972, which have up­set a num­ber of res­i­dents. He had also spo­ken to res­i­dents and hopes to give a progress up­date this week.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia said mit­i­gat­ing op­tions which in­cluded sug­ges­tions from res­i­dents were put up, and he was glad that the LTA is study­ing them.</p>
    <p>Mr Liang said the op­tions dis­cussed will min­imise ex­tra trav­el­ling time caused by the changes and con­tinue to of­fer Pe­tir Road res­i­dents a di­rect bus ser­vice to town dur­ing peak hours.</p>
    <p>From next Sun­day, ser­vices 700 and 700A (the off­peak vari­ant of 700) will be re­moved. They are the only di­rect bus links be­tween Bukit Pan­jang and ar­eas like Or­chard Road, Bras Basah and Shenton Way.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice 171, which links Yishun to Ma­rina Cen­tre and passes through Bukit Pan­jang, will be short­ened.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice 972, which links Bukit Pan­jang to Or­chard Road, will be re-routed to New­ton MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee noted that for ser­vice 972, the main con­cern is the im­pact of the change on trav­el­ling time.</p>
    <p>As for ser­vice 700, while Pe­tir Road res­i­dents can take ser­vice 973 to Hil­lview MRT sta­tion and trans­fer to the Down­town Line at the same fare and travel time, some pre­fer to have a di­rect ser­vice to town, he said. “The fi­nal so­lu­tions may re­quire some give and take be­tween dif­fer­ent groups of com­muters. We will as­sess the op­tions based on their ef­fec­tive­ness... as well as their fi­nan­cial im­pact to en­sure that pub­lic funds are used pru­dently.”</p>
    <p>In an e-mail re­ply to a Bukit Pan­jang res­i­dent who sub­mit­ted a pe­ti­tion with over 2,000 names ask­ing the LTA to re­scind the changes, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said he had asked the LTA to look into the mat­ter, and it should be pre­pared to in­ject more buses into the re­main­ing ser­vices if nec­es­sary.</p>
