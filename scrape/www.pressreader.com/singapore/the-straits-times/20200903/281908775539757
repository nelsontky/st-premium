    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON The Rus­sian group that in­ter­fered in the 2016 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion is at it again, us­ing a net­work of fake ac­counts and a web­site set up to look like a left­wing news site, Face­book and Twit­ter said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paign by the Krem­lin-backed group, known as the In­ter­net Re­search Agency (IRA), is the first pub­lic ev­i­dence that the agency is try­ing to re­peat its ef­forts of four years ago and push vot­ers away from Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den to help Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>In­tel­li­gence agen­cies have warned for months that Rus­sia and other coun­tries were ac­tively try­ing to dis­rupt the Novem­ber elec­tion, and that Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence agen­cies were feed­ing con­spir­acy the­o­ries de­signed to alien­ate Amer­i­cans by laun­der­ing them through fringe sites and so­cial media.</p>
    <p>Now Face­book and Twit­ter are of­fer­ing ev­i­dence of this med­dling, even as the White House in re­cent weeks has sought to more tightly con­trol the flow of in­for­ma­tion about for­eign threats to Novem­ber’s elec­tion and down­play Rus­sian in­ter­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s top in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cial as re­cently as Sun­day has tried to sug­gest that China is a graver risk than Moscow.</p>
    <p>Face­book and Twit­ter, which were slow to re­act to wide-rang­ing dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns on their</p>
    <p>ser­vices in 2016, said they were warned by the Fed­eral Bu­reau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion of the Rus­sian ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Some US of­fi­cials are worried about a broad ef­fort by Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence to use fringe web­sites, spread con­spir­acy the­o­ries and sow di­vi­sion in the United States. And some of the ac­tiv­ity Face­book and Twit­ter iden­ti­fied on Tues­day was just that kind of in­for­ma­tion laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>The fake net­work and site did not reach as big an au­di­ence as ef­forts in 2016, but the cam­paign came with a new wrinkle: The Rus­sians hired real Amer­i­cans to write for it.</p>
    <p>The site, called Peace Data, also used per­sonas with com­puter-gen­er­ated i mages to cre­ate what looked like a le­git­i­mate news or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“The Rus­sians are try­ing harder to hide,” said Mr Ben Nimmo, whose firm, Graphika, worked with Face­book on a re­port on the fake site.</p>
    <p>The IRA ap­peared to be in the ear­li­est stages of build­ing an au­di­ence for the fake news site on Face­book. The group had cre­ated 13 fake ac­counts and two pages ded­i­cated to pro­mot­ing Peace Data. The pages were fol­lowed by 14,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The goal, said Face­book’s head of se­cu­rity Nathaniel Gle­icher, ap­peared to be to drive peo­ple to the Peace Data site, which billed it­self as a “global news or­gan­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>The site’s first ac­tiv­ity was in Oc­to­ber last year, when it be­gan shar­ing ar­ti­cles pub­lished by other out­lets. In March, the site started pub­lish­ing its own ar­ti­cles in English.</p>
    <p>Three ed­i­tors were listed on the site. But when their pho­tos were stud­ied closely, it be­came ap­par­ent they were com­puter-gen­er­ated im­ages, Mr Nimmo said.</p>
    <p>“In terms of post­ing, they were clearly sig­nif­i­cantly left of the Bi­den-Harris cam­paign,” he said, adding that top­ics ranged from racism to the en­vi­ron­ment and cap­i­tal­ism. Sev­eral ar­ti­cles ar­gued that Mr Bi­den would move the Demo­cratic Party too far to the right.</p>
    <p>Mr Bill Russo, a spokesman for the Bi­den cam­paign, said the Rus­sian ac­tiv­ity was “proof of two im­mutable facts: Rus­sia is at­tempt­ing to in­ter­fere in our elec­tions on be­half of Don­ald Trump, and Face­book’s plat­form is a key vec­tor for these ef­forts”.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump’s re­fusal to speak out against Rus­sian in­ter­fer­ence makes it all the more im­por­tant that Face­book does more to en­force their rules and en­sure their plat­form can­not be used to cor­rode the foun­da­tion of our democ­racy,” Mr Russo said.</p>
