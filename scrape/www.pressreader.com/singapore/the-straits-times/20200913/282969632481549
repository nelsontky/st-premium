    <p>Are pro­fes­sion­als from some coun­tries bet­ter at do­ing cer­tain work in the fi­nan­cial and bank­ing sec­tors? Se­nior bankers in­ter­viewed cer­tainly do not think so.</p>
    <p>While it is an ad­van­tage to have for­eign ex­ec­u­tives with lan­guage and cul­tural pro­fi­ciency if the in­ten­tion is to tar­get cus­tomers from their coun­try, it does not make business sense for Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies to hire for­eign tal­ent mostly from only one coun­try if they have a global business plan. This is the rea­son why global com­pa­nies are of­ten proud to show­case their “United Na­tions” work­force be­cause the cul­tural di­ver­sity and their abil­ity to un­der­stand each mar­ket well is a se­cret of their suc­cess.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, HSBC’s Sin­ga­pore head of hu­man re­sources, Mr Bran­don Coate, says that as an in­ter­na­tional bank, HSBC un­re­servedly sup­ports di­ver­sity and in­clu­sion, and this is some­thing that re­flects its val­ues and also makes for a stronger and more sus­tain­able or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“Our sup­port ex­tends to build­ing a strong Sin­ga­pore core and we have poli­cies and mea­sures to in­vest, develop and pro­mote Sin­ga­porean tal­ent – both within Sin­ga­pore and abroad. In fact, there are cur­rently 250 Sin­ga­pore­ans work­ing over­seas within HSBC.”</p>
    <p>Apart from en­sur­ing that the bank’s hir­ing and pro­mo­tion to se­nior po­si­tions will con­tinue to be fair and merit-based, HSBC Sin­ga­pore also has a gen­der-equal­ity pol­icy and is com­mit­ted to groom­ing many Sin­ga­pore women bankers to fill up to 40 per cent of its most se­nior po­si­tions and to have half of them in man­age­rial po­si­tions by 2022.</p>
    <p>The bank also trains its man­agers to help en­sure that re­sourc­ing and tal­ent at­trac­tion are free from bias and dis­crim­i­na­tion. “Fur­ther work will con­tinue in en­sur­ing di­verse suc­ces­sion plan­ning and can­di­date short­list­ing. This is a start and we will keep re­view­ing to en­sure that we have the right poli­cies and pro­cesses in place,” Mr Coate says.</p>
    <p>But when it comes to do­ing the work, ul­ti­mately many bosses pre­fer to judge their em­ploy­ees based on who they are rather than what pass­ports they hold.</p>
    <p>Mr Sunny Quek, OCBC Bank’s head of con­sumer fi­nan­cial ser­vices, says: “I am al­ways very puz­zled when I hear com­ments about how the abil­ity to do a cer­tain job is at­trib­uted to the na­tion­al­ity of the team mem­ber. I can un­der­stand it if it is at­trib­uted to the char­ac­ter of the per­son, but not the na­tion­al­ity. “Your na­tion­al­ity doesn’t de­fine the roles that you do, but your at­ti­tude does.”</p>
    <p>As the boss who over­sees a size­able num­ber of em­ploy­ees in his bank, Mr Quek has worked with many tal­ent dur­ing his 23-year ca­reer in the bank­ing industry. And when it comes to ca­pa­ble peo­ple, he finds that all top bank­ing ex­ec­u­tives share four similar char­ac­ter traits, re­gard­less of their na­tion­al­i­ties. Th­ese are:</p>
    <p>In­tel­lect: They have a high level of know-how when it comes to fi­nan­cial mat­ters and they are able to han­dle math­e­mat­i­cal and eco­nom­ics data with ease. Be­yond th­ese ba­sic skill sets, they are also able to solve com­plex prob­lems and cre­ate in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Dis­ci­pline: They put in hard work, are dili­gent and have the self-dis­ci­pline to com­plete all tasks ahead of dead­lines. Th­ese qual­i­ties are crit­i­cal for those yearning to do well be­cause bankers of­ten work in a fast-paced en­vi­ron­ment and they have to per­form un­der in­tense scru­tiny and de­mand­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>En­tre­pre­neur­ial: Top bankers can think like en­trepreneur­s and are cre­ative in the way they ap­proach a task. This char­ac­ter trait al­lows them to ap­proach a prob­lem from a dif­fer­ent an­gle and take own­er­ship and pride in their work.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tion­ship-build­ing: They have amaz­ing re­la­tion­ship-build­ing skills, such as be­ing able to build rap­port with any­one in all sit­u­a­tions. Their abil­ity to have a high level of en­ergy and a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude help them greatly in de­vel­op­ing and main­tain­ing client re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>While th­ese skills may take years to hone, Mr Quek ad­vises those who are keen to work in fi­nan­cial cen­tres to work on their cus­tomer ser­vice and peo­ple skills first.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, they must have the pa­tience to lis­ten and un­der­stand what their cus­tomers want.</p>
    <p>“We have to be sim­ply spot-on in our ad­vice and what we of­fer to the cus­tomers. Hence our business deal­ings are very per­sonal in or­der for the cus­tomer to open up so that we can un­der­stand their business and their mo­ti­va­tions be­hind the business. This is why our bankers start all of our cus­tomers’ re­la­tion­ships by lis­ten­ing and un­der­stand­ing.”</p>
    <p>Once bank staff un­der­stand what the cus­tomer wants, the next step is to pro­vide the kind of ser­vice that can come only from the heart, and this is to em­pathise with the sit­u­a­tion that the cus­tomer is in, and not to sim­ply deal with the case as part of a daily rou­tine to clear the queue.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially true now be­cause the pan­demic has caused fi­nan­cial hard­ship to many peo­ple and many have to turn to banks as a last re­sort to ask for loans or to de­fer pay­ments for ex­ist­ing loans to ease cash flow. And if banks suc­ceed in help­ing cus­tomers when they need help most, they will earn cus­tomer loy­alty for life.</p>
    <p>Says Mr Quek: “Em­pa­thy, more of­ten than not, opens the door for build­ing trust. When there is trust, cus­tomers are more open to shar­ing not only their cur­rent sit­u­a­tion, but also their fu­ture goals and de­sires.”</p>
