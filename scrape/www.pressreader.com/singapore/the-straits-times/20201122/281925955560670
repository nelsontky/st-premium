    <p>Cy­clists and hik­ers can now tackle the 1.76km Lornie Na­ture Cor­ri­dor – the lat­est sec­tion of the Coast to Coast trail that stretches from Jurong Lake Gar­dens to Coney Is­land Park.</p>
    <p>The cor­ri­dor that opened yes­ter­day also serves as a green route be­tween MacRitchie Reser­voir Park and Adam Road.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Desmond Lee marked the open­ing by plant­ing 150 trees along the cor­ri­dor with the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is part of the One Mil­lion Trees move­ment, which has al­ready planted more than 80,000 trees since its launch in April. It aims to hit its tar­get by 2030.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has around seven mil­lion trees.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said at the launch: “Th­ese ef­forts are part of our com­mit­ment to trans­form Sin­ga­pore into a city in na­ture over the next decade.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese will help mit­i­gate the ef­fects of ur­ban­i­sa­tion and cli­mate change, and pro­vide Sin­ga­pore­ans with greater ac­cess to na­ture and cre­ate a more live­able en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>The cor­ri­dor will also form part of a 10km stretch from Kheam</p>
    <p>BALANC­ING ACT</p>
    <p>Hock Road to Up­per Thom­son Road that is un­der­go­ing rewil­d­ing – a process that al­lows plants to grow nat­u­rally with se­lec­tive in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board has ear­marked 32 stretches of na­ture ways, roads and habi­tats in parks and green spa­ces for rewil­d­ing over the next three years.</p>
    <p>Vege­ta­tion will be al­lowed to grow nat­u­rally at th­ese sites and un­de­sir­able plant species that are more prone to fire and storm risks will be pruned or re­moved.</p>
    <p>The Lornie cor­ri­dor was formed by re­claim­ing land freed up by scal­ing down Lornie Road from seven to four lanes af­ter Lornie High­way was built.</p>
    <p>But con­struct­ing the high­way af­fected part of the Bukit Brown Ceme­tery, which sparked ten­sion be­tween devel­op­ment and con­ser­va­tion ad­vo­cates, Mr Lee noted.</p>
    <p>“We had to grap­ple with trade­offs be­tween im­prov­ing our trans­porta­tion net­works and con­serv­ing our her­itage and bio­di­ver­sity,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Yet, it was th­ese very dif­fi­cult is­sues that opened up con­ver­sa­tions, and al­lowed us to deepen the part­ner­ship be­tween the Govern­ment and civil society such as na­ture and her­itage groups.”</p>
