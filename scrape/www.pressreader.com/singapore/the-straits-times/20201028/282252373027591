    <p>•</p>
    <p>HSBC Hold­ings sig­nalled yes­ter­day that it would em­bark on a pan­demic-in­duced over­haul of its busi­ness model, seek­ing to flip its main source of in­come from in­ter­est rate to fee­based busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>While re­port­ing a 35 per cent tum­ble in quar­terly profit, Europe’s largest bank also ac­cel­er­ated plans to shrink in size and will slash costs fur­ther than pre­vi­ously sug­gested.</p>
    <p>The planned changes to its busi­ness model mark one of the big­gest shifts in strat­egy for HSBC, which has long touted its abil­ity to gen­er­ate in­ter­est in­come from its more than US$1.5 tril­lion (S$2 tril­lion) in cus­tomer de­posits.</p>
    <p>But with in­ter­est rates world­wide now at rock bot­tom and even turn­ing neg­a­tive, the bank is strug­gling to charge more for loans to bor­row­ers than it pays out to de­pos­i­tors and it warned that net in­ter­est in­come would re­main un­der pres­sure.</p>
    <p>In a po­ten­tially seis­mic shift for the bank­ing in­dus­try, HSBC also said it could start charg­ing for prod­ucts such as cur­rent ac­counts that cus­tomers in some mar­kets such as Bri­tain ex­pect to be free.</p>
    <p>“We will have to look at charg­ing for ba­sic bank­ing ser­vices in some mar­kets be­cause a l arge num­ber of our cus­tomers in this en­vi­ron­ment will be l os­ing us money,” chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Ewen Steven­son told Reuters.</p>
    <p>That could prove a tough pill to swal­low in some mar­kets, in­dus­try ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>“It will need to be done care­fully to not dam­age the trust of the brand or get cus­tomers to switch, es­pe­cially in coun­tries where com­peti­tors of­fer the ser­vice for no charge,” said Mr Sudeepto Mukher­jee, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, at con­sult­ing firm Publi­cis Sapi­ent.</p>
    <p>Faced with fewer op­tions to bol­ster rev­enue growth, Asia-fo­cused HSBC has been look­ing to re­duce costs glob­ally and in June re­sumed plans to cut around 35,000 jobs it had put on ice af­ter the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The bank has no im­me­di­ate plans to cut even more jobs, Mr Steven­son said, but that could hap­pen as its trans­for­ma­tion plans con­tinue.</p>
    <p>HSBC said yes­ter­day it plans to re­duce an­nual costs to be­low US$31 bil­lion by 2022, a more am­bi­tious tar­get than it set out in Fe­bru­ary and well be­low the op­er­at­ing ex­penses of US$42.3 bil­lion it re­ported in 2019.</p>
    <p>It will also ac­cel­er­ate the trans­for­ma­tion of its US busi­ness, where it has long strug­gled to com­pete with big­ger lo­cal play­ers, and will pro­vide an up­date at its 2020 full-year re­sults next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The re­struc­tur­ing mea­sures helped HSBC’s shares climb more than 5 per cent, al­though they have still lost nearly half their value for the year to date.</p>
    <p>Un­der­scor­ing its chal­lenges, the bank’s rev­enues fell 11 per cent com­pared with the third quar­ter last year to US$11.9 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>But the 35 per cent slide in pre­tax profit to US$3.1 bil­lion was not as deep as ex­pected, and was bet­ter than a con­sen­sus es­ti­mate of US$2.07 bil­lion as HSBC flagged an eas­ing in bad loan pro­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>HSBC now ex­pects losses from bad loans to be at the lower end of the US$8 bil­lion to US$13 bil­lion range it set out ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes such as loans and wage sup­port for work­ers have helped to gen­uinely mit­i­gate some credit losses rather than merely de­fer them to next year, Mr Steven­son said.</p>
    <p>“What th­ese schemes have done in par­tic­u­lar is buy time for a lot of the cor­po­rate sec­tor to re­struc­ture them­selves, and go out and raise debt and eq­uity fi­nance.”</p>
    <p>HSBC, in com­mon with other Bri­tish len­ders, stopped pay­ing div­i­dends ear­lier this year at the re­quest of reg­u­la­tors. It said it would com­mu­ni­cate a re­vised div­i­dend pol­icy in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
