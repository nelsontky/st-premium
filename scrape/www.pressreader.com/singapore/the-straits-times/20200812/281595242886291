    <p>For­mer Pe­nang chief min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng yes­ter­day pleaded not guilty to fresh cor­rup­tion charges in­volv­ing so­lic­it­ing bribes in a worker dor­mi­tory project in Pe­nang. Busi­ness­woman Phang Li Koon, a fam­ily friend, was charged with abet­ting him in the bribery case. Also charged was Lim’s wife.</p>
    <p>BUTTERWORT­H • Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion politi­cian Lim Guan Eng yes­ter­day pleaded not guilty to fresh cor­rup­tion charges in­volv­ing so­lic­it­ing bribes in a worker dor­mi­tory project in Pe­nang when he was the state’s chief min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness­woman Phang Li Koon, a fam­ily friend, was charged with abet­ting him in the bribery case.</p>
    <p>Also charged was Lim’s wife, Betty Chew, who claimed trial to charges of laun­der­ing the money in the bribery case.</p>
    <p>Lim, who was Pe­nang’s chief min­is­ter and chair­man of Pe­nang De­vel­op­ment Corp, is ac­cused of en­sur­ing that Mag­nif­i­cent Em­blem, a com­pany be­lieved to be re­lated to Phang, was awarded a RM11.61 mil­lion (S$3.8 mil­lion) worker dor­mi­tory project in Batu Kawan be­tween Aug 19, 2013 and March 3, 2016, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Lim was also charged over us­ing his po­si­tion as chief min­is­ter to ask for RM372,009 in bribes for his wife Chew, through the pri­vate com­pany Ex­cel Prop­erty Man­age­ment and Con­sul­tancy.</p>
    <p>Lim was the state’s chief min­is­ter be­tween 2008 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Phang, 48, pleaded not guilty to the charge of abet­ting Lim.</p>
    <p>Me­dia re­ports say Chew, 56, pleaded not guilty to three charges un­der the Anti-Money Laun­der­ing, Anti-Ter­ror­ism Fi­nanc­ing and Pro­ceeds of Un­law­ful Ac­tiv­i­ties Act.</p>
    <p>These are fresh charges against the 59-year-old Lim who had – last Fri­day and this Mon­day – been charged over a Pe­nang un­der­sea tun­nel project.</p>
    <p>The new charges are not re­lated to a case over the sale and pur­chase of a bun­ga­low in Pe­nang in 2015. Both Lim and Phang were charged over that case in 2016 and ac­quit­ted in 2018.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Lim was charged in a Kuala Lumpur court with us­ing his po­si­tion as Pe­nang chief min­is­ter to solicit a 10 per cent bribe based on fu­ture prof­its of a RM6.3 bil­lion un­der­sea tun­nel project for the state. He pleaded not guilty.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Lim pleaded not guilty to a charge of us­ing his po­si­tion as then chief min­is­ter to solicit a RM3.3 mil­lion bribe re­lated to the same un­der­sea tun­nel project.</p>
    <p>Lim is out on bail of RM1 mil­lion for the tun­nel project case.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the judge in Butterwort­h, in main­land Pe­nang, set bail at RM50,000 each for the three ac­cused.</p>
    <p>Lim, who is sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the op­po­si­tion Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party – the big­gest party in Par­lia­ment with 42 MPs – has claimed po­lit­i­cal per­se­cu­tion against him by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Pe­nang tun­nel project has been on the radar of the Malaysian Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion since 2017.</p>
    <p>But the in­ves­ti­ga­tion against Lim picked up pace only re­cently, months af­ter the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) ad­min­is­tra­tion lost fed­eral power to Perikatan Na­sional fol­low­ing a se­ries of de­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Lim was Malaysia’s fi­nance min­is­ter for nearly 22 months in the PH gov­ern­ment, led by Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, which col­lapsed five months ago.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of any of the charges linked to the tun­nel or dor­mi­tory project, Lim faces a jail term of up to 20 years and a fine not less than five times the amount of the bribe or RM10,000, which­ever is higher.</p>
    <p>The son of vet­eran law­maker Lim Kit Siang, Lim had been be­hind bars twice. He was de­tained in 1987 for two years in a mass crack­down on po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents by then Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir.</p>
    <p>In 1998, Lim was sen­tenced to 18 months in prison and re­leased af­ter 12 months un­der the Sedi­tion Act and the Print­ing Presses and Pub­li­ca­tions Act, in a case in­volv­ing the al­leged rape of a mi­nor by a for­mer Me­laka chief min­is­ter.</p>
