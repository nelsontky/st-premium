    <p>De­spite be­ing in­volved in deals that amounted to about US$10.5 mil­lion, the founder of the Sin­ga­pore firm that in­vented the thumb drive failed to dis­close those trans­ac­tions made be­tween his main­board-listed com­pany and two other firms.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Henry Tan, founder of Trek 2000 In­ter­na­tional, even at­tended au­dit com­mit­tee meet­ings at which the topic of such trans­ac­tions was un­der re­view.</p>
    <p>The 63-year-old, who is also known as Henn Tan, was yes­ter­day fined $80,000 af­ter plead­ing guilty to two charges un­der the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act.</p>
    <p>Four other charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion. He also faces nine other out­stand­ing charges that have been sched­uled for a pre-trial con­fer­ence on Sept 10.</p>
    <p>Tan, who was rep­re­sented by Drew & Napier lawyers Daniel Cai and Wes­ley Chan, had stepped down in May 2018 as chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions provider.</p>
    <p>While he was CEO, Trek 2000 In­ter­na­tional’s sub­sidiaries made six trans­ac­tions worth US$882,000 with S-Com So­lu­tions HK in 2010, and 18 trans­ac­tions worth US$9.59 mil­lion with T-Data Sys­tems in 2013.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Tan did not dis­close th­ese trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>T-Data is a pri­vate firm in­cor­po­rated in Sin­ga­pore, while S-Com So­lu­tions is in­cor­po­rated in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous elec­tronic parts were trans­acted be­tween the two firms and Trek 2000 In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Tan’s son held 80 per cent of TData shares, while Tan was the sole share­holder of S-Com So­lu­tions at the time, making both com­pa­nies “in­ter­ested per­sons” in re­la­tion to Trek 2000 In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Be­ing a main­board-listed com­pany, Trek 2000 In­ter­na­tional was re­quired to im­me­di­ately an­nounce those trans­ac­tions, since the ag­gre­gate value of all trans­ac­tions with each of the two firms that fi­nan­cial year was 3 per cent or more of the group’s lat­est tan­gi­ble as­sets.</p>
    <p>Two oth­ers – Gur­cha­ran Singh, then the chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer of Trek 2000 In­ter­na­tional, and Poo Teng Pin, then the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor – were ear­lier charged with re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>Poo pleaded guilty on March 4 to a charge of fail­ing to dis­close seven in­ter­ested per­son trans­ac­tions with T-Data and was later fined $20,000.</p>
    <p>Pro­ceed­ings against Gur­cha­ran are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Cai ar­gued that since the charges Tan faced are iden­ti­cal to Poo’s, a $20,000 fine should be the start­ing point for each charge.</p>
    <p>But Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Tan Ee Kuan ar­gued that Tan was more cul­pa­ble and “reck­less, or grossly neg­li­gent”, as the topic of in­ter­ested per­son trans­ac­tions was brought to his at­ten­tion at the au­dit com­mit­tee meet­ings but he did not dis­close the trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Ron­ald Gwee agreed with the pros­e­cu­tion that Tan’s sen­tence should be “scaled higher” than Poo’s, not­ing that the lat­ter had faced fewer charges.</p>
    <p>The judge sen­tenced Tan to a fine of $35,000 for the of­fence re­lat­ing to T-Data and $45,000 for the of­fence re­lat­ing to S-Com So­lu­tions.</p>
