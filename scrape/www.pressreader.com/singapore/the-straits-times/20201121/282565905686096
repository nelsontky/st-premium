    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Conor McGre­gor is set to re­verse his lat­est flir­ta­tion with re­tire­ment with a fight against Dustin Poirier in Jan­uary, the Ir­ish mixed mar­tial arts star said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>A state­ment on the 32-year-old’s news web­site, TheMacLife.com, said the light­weight con­test would take place on Jan 23, with Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emi­rates the likely venue.</p>
    <p>The web­site said he had signed his agree­ment to fight as the main event on UFC 257. Poirier has also signed up for the bout.</p>
    <p>“I am very grate­ful to be about to re­turn and get to do what I love again,” McGre­gor, a for­mer twoweight UFC cham­pion, was quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>“I look for­ward to the fresh test Dustin will bring since our first bout, while also show­cas­ing my own i ncred­i­bly deep cache of weaponry. What­ever tool is</p>
    <p>needed on the night will be pulled from the duf­fel.”</p>
    <p>McGre­gor, who de­feated Poirier via a first-round knock­out in 2014, has not fought since Jan­uary when he de­feated Amer­i­can Don­ald Cer</p>
    <p>rone in 40 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>The Ir­ish­man pre­vi­ously held the feath­er­weight and light­weight UFC ti­tles, but was stripped of the for­mer and lost the lat­ter to Khabib Nur­magome­dov, who re­tired un­de­feated in Oc­to­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>An an­noyed McGre­gor, who had pre­vi­ously an­nounced mul­ti­ple re­tire­ments be­fore re­turn­ing to the oc­tagon, said in July he had re­tired af­ter be­com­ing frus­trated at prob­lems ar­rang­ing bouts due to the Covid-19 pan­demic and clashes with UFC.</p>
    <p>“Hey guys I’ve de­cided to re­tire from fight­ing,” he wrote on Twit­ter then.</p>
    <p>“Thank you all for the amaz­ing mem­o­ries! What a ride it’s been! Here is a pic­ture of my­self and my mother in Las Ve­gas post one of my world ti­tle wins! Pick the home of your dreams Mags I love you! What­ever you de­sire it’s yours.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, few took the pledge se­ri­ously, and McGre­gor con­tin­ued to be linked to a pos­si­ble cross­com­bat fight with Filipino box­ing icon Manny Pac­quiao be­fore the Poirier bout was con­firmed.</p>
