    <p>Barcelona coach Ron­ald Koe­man said Lionel Messi had agreed to start as a sub­sti­tute against Real Betis on Satur­day, after the Ar­gentina for­ward came off the bench to net twice for a 5-2 La Liga win.</p>
    <p>The cap­tain had not failed to make the team’s first XI since a de­feat by Granada in Septem­ber last year. It prompted spec­u­la­tion es­pe­cially as Messi put in a trans­fer re­quest in the sum­mer but had with­drawn it over Barca’s de­ci­sion to dig their heels in.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Koe­man claimed the 33-year-old had not been feel­ing well since Wed­nes­day’s 2-1 win over Dy­namo Kiev in the Cham­pi­ons League and so his omis­sion as a starter was just a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>“Since yes­ter­day, we were talk­ing about some dis­com­fort he was feel­ing since the game and we de­cided that the best thing was to leave him on the bench in case we needed him,” the Dutch­man said.</p>
    <p>“He would have started if he hadn’t had any dis­com­fort. We all know who he is and I don’t have any doubts about him. He didn’t start but he was very im­por­tant in the sec­ond half.”</p>
    <p>Barca, who had failed to win their last four league out­ings, cre­ated lots of chances with­out Messi in a wide open first half, but only had Ous­mane Dem­bele’s opener to show for it.</p>
    <p>When An­toine Griez­mann failed to con­vert his penalty and Betis equalised late in first-half added time via An­to­nio Sara­bia, it looked like Betis might make the hosts pay.</p>
    <p>But Messi was thrown on for the in­jured Ansu Fati right after the in­ter­val and one of his first acts on the ball proved to be de­ci­sive, dum­my­ing Jordi Alba’s cross for Griez­mann to tap home early on.</p>
    <p>He then scored a penalty be­fore nab­bing his first goal in open play this sea­son, with Pedri round­ing off the scor­ing.</p>
    <p>Barca’s first league vic­tory since Oct 1 took them into the top half of the ta­ble with 11 points from seven games, but it was soured by Fati’s in­jury. The 18-year-old, who has pulled out of the Spain team for the com­ing in­ter­na­tional fix­tures, suf­fered an in­ter­nal menis­cus tear in his left knee that is ex­pected to keep him out for months.</p>
    <p>Fati has emerged as one of the team’s most ex­cit­ing play­ers this sea­son, hav­ing net­ted six goals, in­clud­ing one for Spain in Septem­ber, which made the fleet-footed winger his coun­try’s youngest goalscorer.</p>
