    <p>This year’s Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon (SCSM) will fea­ture a hy­brid race for­mat in­cor­po­rat­ing a vir­tual race and aug­mented re­al­ity (AR) be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, or­gan­is­ers Iron­man Asia said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion for the Nov 27-Dec 6 event is free and has opened. The five cat­e­gories are Grand Fi­nale Rouvy AR 10km and half marathon, Grand Fi­nale VR 10km, half marathon and dou­ble up chal­lenge (both dis­tances).</p>
    <p>Run­ners must com­plete their re­spec­tive race in one set­ting. They can choose the out­door or in­door race op­tion with a com­pat­i­ble track­ing de­vice or run on a tread­mill to ex­pe­ri­ence the im­mer­sive AR for­mat, which al­lows par­tic­i­pants to cre­ate avatars and see them­selves com­pet­ing with fel­low run­ners in real time.</p>
    <p>The routes, which fea­ture some of the coun­try’s iconic lo­ca­tions in Or­chard Road, Lit­tle In­dia and Chi­na­town, have been cu­rated in part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB).</p>
    <p>Lo­cal run­ners with­out ac­cess to a tread­mill can opt for the AR for­mat and com­plete the runs on tread­mills at 12 Ac­tiveSG gyms is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>Ge­off Meyer, Iron­man Group’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Asia, said this year’s SCSM will be “a race like no other”. He added: “We look for­ward to hav­ing peo­ple around the world par­tic­i­pate in the race vir­tu­ally and safely, and to end the year with an up­lift­ing event.”</p>
    <p>STB chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan praised the or­gan­is­ers for “boldly reimag­in­ing the race dur­ing this chal­leng­ing pe­riod” and noted that “marathons are all about over­com­ing ob­sta­cles and push­ing your lim­its”.</p>
    <p>He added: “We’re ex­cited that run­ners from all over the world can ex­pe­ri­ence the sights and sounds of our beau­ti­ful city vir­tu­ally this year. We hope this will in­spire them to visit us in per­son, in time to come.”</p>
    <p>Run­ners were ex­cited about the changes, with Sin­ga­pore’s “Blade Run­ner” Shar­iff Ab­dul­lah say­ing the for­mat makes the SCSM more ac­ces­si­ble to per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties (PWDs).</p>
    <p>“PWDs have their own kind of chal­lenge with some wear­ing a pros­thetic leg and some in a wheel­chair. By do­ing a vir­tual race, they can cre­ate their own route and take their own time since they don’t have to fin­ish in a stip­u­lated time,” said the 52-year-old, who plans to sign up for the Dou­ble Up Chal­lenge and com­plete it in a day.</p>
    <p>Sports pre­sen­ter John Yeong, who will be tak­ing part in his fourth SCSM, added: “You can­not repli­cate the at­mos­phere of feel­ing the en­ergy and over­all vibe of the event. But run­ning on the tread­mill with AR is still cool be­cause you get to see some routes that you wouldn’t usu­ally run at.”</p>
    <p>The SCSM tra­di­tion­ally at­tracts over 50,000 run­ners ev­ery year and while this year’s race will be vir­tual, res­i­dents here can at­tend the Grand Fi­nale Cel­e­bra­tion Ex­pe­ri­ence at Gar­dens by the Bay on Dec 5 and 6.</p>
    <p>This is open only to those who have pur­chased Grand Fi­nale race en­ti­tle­ments ($65 for the dou­ble up chal­lenge and $60 for the other cat­e­gories) which in­clude a run­ner’s sin­glet, an SCSM bot­tle and back­pack, and a medal.</p>
    <p>Pre-reg­is­tra­tion for the two-day event is re­quired and safe man­age­ment mea­sures will be in place. There will be 16 ses­sions in to­tal with a cap of 125 par­tic­i­pants for each ses­sion, which will last be­tween 60 and 90 min­utes from 9am to 9pm over both days.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers may open more slots de­pend­ing on de­mand.</p>
    <p>Sport Sin­ga­pore’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Teck Yin said: “The or­gan­is­ers have cre­atively put to­gether a cel­e­bra­tion of the SCSM through an im­mer­sive and en­gag­ing jour­ney and ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
