    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who want to des­ig­nate some­one to make de­ci­sions on their be­half should they be­come men­tally in­ca­pac­i­tated can do so for free till March 31 next year.</p>
    <p>The waiver of fees for Last­ing Power of At­tor­ney (LPA) Form 1 ap­pli­ca­tions has been fur­ther ex­tended to end-March next year, Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>From mid-2021, LPA ap­pli­ca­tions can also be made and reg­is­tered on­line as part of the over­all dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion of the pub­lic ser­vice to bet­ter serve Sin­ga­pore­ans, Mr Masa­gos said in a writ­ten an­swer to MP Cheng Li Hui (Tampines GRC) in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fee waiver, first in­tro­duced in Septem­ber 2014, has been ex­tended twice be­fore – in 2016 and 2018, to en­cour­age more peo­ple to make such ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>The 2018 ex­ten­sion started on Sept 1 and ended on Aug 31 this year, and in this pe­riod, about 42,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans reg­is­tered LPAs. As of Aug 31, 88,300 Sin­ga­pore­ans have reg­is­tered LPAs. There are two LPA forms.</p>
    <p>Form 1 grants gen­eral pow­ers to those act­ing on the men­tally in­ca­pac­i­tated per­son’s be­half. To en­cour­age more Sin­ga­pore­ans to make an LPA, the fee waiver for LPA Form 1 has been fur­ther ex­tended to March 31 next year. Some 98 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans who made an LPA used Form 1.</p>
    <p>Form 2 is for ap­pli­cants who want to grant spe­cific or cus­tomised pow­ers to those who will make de­ci­sions for them and has to be drafted by a lawyer. The ap­pli­ca­tion fee for Form 2 is $200 for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Since Jan 30 this year, the LPA forms have also been re­vised to make the ap­pli­ca­tion process eas­ier and more con­ve­nient, said Mr Masa­gos.</p>
    <p>“We have also worked to raise aware­ness in the com­mu­nity through out­reach via getai, ra­dio ad­ver­tis­ing and com­mu­nity road­shows (be­fore Covid-19). Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, we con­ducted vir­tual talks to hos­pi­tals, par­tic­i­pated in a vir­tual road­show by the Coun­cil for Third Age, and are in talks with banks to con­duct LPA we­bi­nars.</p>
    <p>“We are also work­ing with com­mu­nity part­ners to en­hance the ac­ces­si­bil­ity and con­ve­nience” for cit­i­zens in mak­ing an LPA ap­pli­ca­tion, said Mr Masa­gos.</p>
    <p>For those who re­quire some fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to make an LPA, they can ap­proach not-for-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions that of­fer LPA cer­tifi­cate-is­su­ing ser­vices at sub­sidised rates. These not-for-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions in­clude Life Point, Pot­ter’s Place Com­mu­nity Ser­vices So­ci­ety and Mount Alver­nia Out­reach Med­i­cal Clinic in En­abling Vil­lage.</p>
    <p>From mid-2021, LPA ap­pli­ca­tions can also be made and reg­is­tered on­line as part of the over­all dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion of the pub­lic ser­vice to bet­ter serve Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
