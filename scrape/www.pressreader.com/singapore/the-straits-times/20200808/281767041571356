    <p>• The Pres­i­dent of Le­banon said yes­ter­day an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the big­gest blast in Beirut’s his­tory would ex­am­ine whether “ex­ter­nal in­ter­fer­ence” had a role, as res­i­dents tried to re­build their shat­tered lives and homes af­ter the ex­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>The search for those miss­ing in­ten­si­fied, as res­cuers raced to find any­one still alive af­ter Tues­day’s ex­plo­sion that killed 154, smashed up a swathe of the city and sent shock­waves around the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“The cause has not been de­ter­mined yet. There is a pos­si­bil­ity of ex­ter­nal in­ter­fer­ence through a rocket or bomb or other act,” Pres­i­dent Michel Aoun said in com­ments car­ried by lo­cal me­dia and con­firmed by his of­fice.</p>
    <p>He said the gov­ern­ment would also con­sider whether it was a re­sult of neg­li­gence or an ac­ci­dent. He pre­vi­ously blamed neg­li­gence in the stor­age of highly ex­plo­sive ma­te­rial for years at the port.</p>
    <p>The United States has pre­vi­ously said it has not ruled out an at­tack.</p>
    <p>Is­rael, which has fought sev­eral wars with Le­banon, has also pre­vi­ously de­nied it had any role.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity forces fired tear gas at a fu­ri­ous crowd in Beirut late on Thursday, as anger boiled over at the rul­ing elite, who have presided over a na­tion that faced eco­nomic col­lapse even be­fore the deadly port blast in­jured over 5,000. The crowd, some hurl­ing stones, marked a re­turn to the kind of protests that had be­come a fea­ture of life in Beirut, as Le­banese watched their savings evap­o­rate while gov­ern­ment de­ci­sion-mak­ing floun­dered.</p>
    <p>“There is no way we can re­build this house. Where is the state?” asked Mr Tony Ab­dou, an un­em­ployed 60-year-old. His fam­ily home is in Gem­mayze, a district just a few hun­dred me­tres from the port ware­houses where 2,750 tonnes of highly ex­plo­sive am­mo­nium ni­trate were stored for years, a tick­ing time bomb near a densely pop­u­lated area. A se­cu­rity source and lo­cal me­dia pre­vi­ously said the fire that caused the blast was ig­nited by ware­house weld­ing work.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers swept up de­bris from the streets of Beirut, which still bears scars from the 1975-1990 civil war and has of­ten wit­nessed bomb­ings and other un­rest since then.</p>
    <p>“Do we ac­tu­ally have a gov­ern­ment here?” said taxi driver Nas­sim Abi­aad, 66, whose cab was crushed by fall­ing build­ing wreck­age just as he was about to get into the ve­hi­cle. “There is no way to make money any more,” he added.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has promised a full in­ves­ti­ga­tion. State news agency NNA said 16 peo­ple were taken into cus­tody. But for many Le­banese, the ex­plo­sion was symp­to­matic of the years of ne­glect by the au­thor­i­ties while state cor­rup­tion thrived.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have said the blast might have caused losses amount­ing to US$15 bil­lion (S$20.5 bil­lion) – a bill the coun­try can­not pay when it has al­ready de­faulted on its moun­tain of na­tional debt, ex­ceed­ing 150 per cent of eco­nomic out­put, and talks about a life­line from the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund have stalled.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals, many heav­ily dam­aged, have been over­whelmed by the num­ber of ca­su­al­ties.</p>
    <p>In the port area, res­cue teams set up lights to work through the night in a dash to find those still miss­ing, as fam­i­lies waited tensely, many slowly los­ing hope. Some vic­tims were hurled into the sea by the blast.</p>
    <p>The weep­ing mother of one of the miss­ing called a prime­time TV pro­gramme on Thursday night to plead with the au­thor­i­ties to find her son, Joe. He was found dead hours later.</p>
    <p>Le­banese Red Cross sec­re­tary gen­eral Ge­orge Ket­taneh told lo­cal ra­dio VDL that three more bod­ies had been found in the search, while the health min­is­ter yes­ter­day said the death toll had climbed to 154. Dozens are still un­ac­counted for.</p>
    <p>Mr Char­bel Abreeni, who trained port em­ploy­ees, showed Reuters pic­tures on his phone of killed col­leagues. “I know 30 port em­ploy­ees who died, two of them were my close friends and a third is miss­ing,” said the 62-year-old, whose home was wrecked in the blast. His shin was ban­daged. “How can you sur­vive here, the econ­omy is zero?”</p>
    <p>A press­ing chal­lenge for the gov­ern­ment is en­sur­ing the na­tion has enough food, af­ter the blast de­stroyed the coun­try’s only ma­jor grain silo. United Na­tions agen­cies were work­ing to hand out food parcels and de­liver med­i­cal sup­plies. Of­fers of aid have also poured in from Arab states, West­ern na­tions and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Less than 48 hours af­ter the blast, Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron of France on Thursday did what no se­nior Le­banese politi­cian has: He came to see the suf­fer­ing first hand.</p>
    <p>“What is also needed here is po­lit­i­cal change,” he said. “This ex­plo­sion should be the start of a new era.” Be­fore leav­ing Le­banon, Mr Macron said he had pre­sented Le­banese lead­ers with a list of ur­gent re­forms that needed to be car­ried out to un­lock bil­lions of dol­lars in in­ter­na­tional funds.</p>
