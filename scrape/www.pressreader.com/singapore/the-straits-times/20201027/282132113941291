    <p>SYD­NEY • Oil ex­tended its slide to a sec­ond day on a toxic cock­tail of surg­ing coron­avirus cases in the US and Europe, dwin­dling prospects over pre-elec­tion stim­u­lus in Wash­ing­ton and a steady re­sump­tion of sup­ply from Libya.</p>
    <p>Brent crude was down 89 US cents or 2.1 per cent at US$40.88 by 0647 GMT yes­ter­day. US West Texas In­ter­me­di­ate (WTI) fell 89 US cents or 2.2 per cent to US$38.96, hav­ing fallen more than a dol­lar shortly af­ter the start of trad­ing. Brent fell 2.7 per cent last week and WTI lost 2.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The United States had its high­est num­ber yet of new coron­avirus in­fec­tions in two days un­til last Satur­day, while i n France new cases hit a record of over 50,000 on Sun­day, rais­ing wor­ries about crude de­mand. Italy ap­proved a par­tial lock­down and Spain an­nounced a na­tional cur­few.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Democrats and Re­pub­li­cans in the US ac­cused each other of “mov­ing the goal­posts” in in­ter­views on CNN as hopes for a deal be­fore next week’s elec­tion ap­peared to be in tat­ters.</p>
    <p>On the sup­ply side, Libya’s Na­tional Oil Corp last Fri­day ended its force ma­jeure on ex­ports from two key ports and said pro­duc­tion would reach one mil­lion bar­rels per day (bpd) in four weeks, a quicker ramp-up than an­a­lysts pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>“New bar­rels of Libyan oil come at a time when the crude oil mar­ket had just faced dis­ap­point­ment from the re­cently con­cluded Opec+ min­is­te­rial panel (which) made no new pol­icy pro­pos­als,” said com­modi­ties man­ager Av­tar Sandu at Phillip Fu­tures in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Opec+, a group­ing of pro­duc­ers in­clud­ing the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Pe­tro­leum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries and Rus­sia, is also set to in­crease out­put by two mil­lion bpd next Jan­uary af­ter cut­ting pro­duc­tion by a record amount ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>A lit­tle more than six months af­ter Covid-19 sent oil prices into a tail­spin, a sec­ond wave is threat­en­ing to take an­other bite out of en­ergy de­mand. But there are sev­eral rea­sons why a re­peat of April’s blood­bath is un­likely. Flagging con­sump­tion is not co­in­cid­ing with a price war, gov­ern­ments may be less likely to im­pose ma­jor lock­downs and de­mand in Asia is hold­ing up.</p>
    <p>“De­mand is­sues tied to resur­gent virus cases have taken the mar­ket’s at­ten­tion for the past few weeks,” said Aus­tralia and New Zealand Bank­ing Group’s com­mod­ity strate­gist Daniel Hynes. “The sup­ply side is­sues have now started to gain a lit­tle bit more promi­nence with Libya sug­gest­ing that their sup­plies will rise sig­nif­i­cantly over the next cou­ple of months. That presents a new head­wind for Opec.”</p>
    <p>If virus cases keep ris­ing in Europe and the US, it is pos­si­ble Opec+ will push back a planned eas­ing of pro­duc­tion cuts from Jan­uary. Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin last week sig­nalled open­ness to de­lay­ing the ta­per. The group will de­cide on whether to stick to the cur­rent plan at a meet­ing set for Nov 30 to Dec 1.</p>
