    <p>CHICAGO • Delta Air Lines is set to fur­lough 1,941 pi­lots in Oc­to­ber, the car­rier said in a memo seen by Reuters on Monday that noted the fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic and plung­ing air travel de­mand.</p>
    <p>US air­lines have warned they will need to fur­lough tens of thou­sands of work­ers once US$25 bil­lion (S$34.2 bil­lion) in US gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus funds run out next month. The aid, which cov­ered em­ploy­ees’ pay, was to help them weather the pan­demic and pre­serve jobs un­til a re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“We are sim­ply over­staffed and we are faced with an in­cred­i­bly dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion,” Delta’s head of flight oper­a­tions John Laugh­ter said in a memo to em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“We are six months into this pan­demic and only 25 per cent of our rev­enues have been re­cov­ered. Un­for­tu­nately, we see few cat­a­lysts over the next six months to mean­ing­ful change this tra­jec­tory.”</p>
    <p>At­lanta-based Delta, one of the largest US air­lines, had orig­i­nally es­ti­mated a sur­plus of 2,558 pi­lots but re­duced the fi­nal num­ber of in­vol­un­tary fur­loughs fol­low­ing take-up for early re­tire­ment and vol­un­tary de­par­ture pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Mr Laugh­ter said Delta would need some 9,450 ac­tive pi­lots for the sum­mer 2021 sched­ule, which the car­rier ex­pects will be the peak fly­ing pe­riod for the next 12 to 18 months. But there were roughly 11,200 ac­tive pi­lots still on Delta’s ros­ter af­ter vol­un­tary early de­par­ture pro­grammes, he said.</p>
    <p>Air­lines and unions have been lob­by­ing Wash­ing­ton to ex­tend an­other US$25 bil­lion in aid to pro­tect jobs through March un­der a broader ex­pan­sion of coronaviru­s stim­u­lus funds, but talks are at a stand­still.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Air­lines and United Air­lines, Delta’s ma­jor ri­vals, have warned they could po­ten­tially cull more than 60,000 jobs in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Delta also an­nounced on Monday the re­tire­ment of chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Gil West, who helped lead the merger in­te­gra­tion of Delta and North­west af­ter join­ing the com­pany in 2008.</p>
    <p>Mr West will stay on through the end of next month while the com­pany eval­u­ates “how to best tran­si­tion his re­spon­si­bil­i­ties in the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment”, chief ex­ec­u­tive Ed Bas­tian said in a sep­a­rate note to em­ploy­ees.</p>
