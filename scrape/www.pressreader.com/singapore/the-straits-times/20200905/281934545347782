    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysian pros­e­cu­tors yes­ter­day with­drew crim­i­nal charges against three Gold­man Sachs units ac­cused of mis­lead­ing in­vestors over US$6.5 bil­lion (S$8.9 bil­lion) in bond sales they helped or­gan­ise for a state fund, the Ber­nama state news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The move comes af­ter Gold­man Sachs agreed to pay US$3.9 bil­lion to Malaysia to set­tle a probe into its al­leged role in the scan­dal in­volv­ing the fund, 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB), which counts for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak as one of its co-founders.</p>
    <p>The United States Depart­ment of Jus­tice es­ti­mates US$4.5 bil­lion was mis­ap­pro­pri­ated from 1MDB be­tween 2009 and 2014, in­clud­ing some of the funds that Gold­man Sachs helped raise.</p>
    <p>The units – based in Lon­don, Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore – had pleaded not guilty in Fe­bru­ary and the bank has con­sis­tently de­nied wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>“Gold­man Sachs In­ter­na­tional Ltd, Gold­man Sachs (Asia) LLC and Gold­man Sachs (Sin­ga­pore) are there­fore dis­charged amount­ing to an ac­quit­tal from all four charges made against them,” Ber­nama quoted High Court judge Mo­hamed Zaini Ma­zlan as say­ing as he granted pros­e­cu­tors the re­quest.</p>
    <p>Lawyers for Gold­man Sachs and the pros­e­cu­tion could not be im­me­di­ately reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>As part of its deal with Malaysia, Gold­man has paid US$2.5 bil­lion in cash and guar­an­teed the re­turn of US$1.4 bil­lion in 1MDB as­sets seized around the world.</p>
    <p>At least six coun­tries in­clud­ing Switzer­land and Sin­ga­pore have opened money laun­der­ing and graft probes into 1MDB in a scan­dal that im­pli­cated Na­jib and high-level of­fi­cials of the fund.</p>
    <p>In July, Na­jib was found guilty of cor­rup­tion and sen­tenced to 12 years’ jail in the first of sev­eral tri­als he faces over 1MDB. Na­jib has main­tained that he is in­no­cent.</p>
