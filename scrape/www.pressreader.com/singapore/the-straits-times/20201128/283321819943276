    <p>• The Mu­seum of London on Thurs­day an­nounced a project to col­lect the dreams of Lon­don­ers dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic as a way to doc­u­ment the im­pact of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The lives of in­hab­i­tants of the Bri­tish cap­i­tal have changed “not just in the day to day” be­cause of the pan­demic, but also “in re­la­tion to how we sleep and dream”, the mu­seum said.</p>
    <p>The project, dubbed Guardians Of Sleep, l ooks to col­lect the dreams in the form of oral his­to­ries. It will also ex­plore what in­sight dreams might of­fer into men­tal health and ways of cop­ing with ex­ter­nal stresses, es­pe­cially in times of cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a King’s Col­lege London and Ip­sos Mori sur­vey in</p>
    <p>June, the global Covid-19 cri­sis can trou­ble the mind not just dur­ing wak­ing hours, but also dur­ing sleep.</p>
    <p>The Mu­seum of London is launch­ing the ini­tia­tive in part­ner­ship with the Mu­seum of Dreams, based at West­ern Univer­sity in Canada.</p>
    <p>Ms Foteini Ara­vani, dig­i­tal cu­ra­tor at the Mu­seum of London, said the record­ing of dreams would al­low it to not only “doc­u­ment a key shared ex­pe­ri­ence from the pan­demic”, but also to stretch the def­i­ni­tion of a “mu­seum ob­ject”.</p>
    <p>“Tra­di­tion­ally, when mu­se­ums have col­lected dreams, it has been in the form of artis­tic im­pres­sion, for ex­am­ple, paint­ings or drawings in­flu­enced by the events. How­ever, this can of­ten dis­so­ci­ate the dream from the dreamer,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We will col­lect dreams as first­per­son oral his­to­ries with the aim to pro­vide a more emo­tional and per­sonal nar­ra­tive of this time for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Sharon Sli­win­ski, cre­ator of the Mu­seum of Dreams, said the re­search with the Mu­seum of London “aims to pro­vide a rich re­source for fur­ther un­der­stand­ing the sig­nif­i­cance of dream life as a mech­a­nism for work­ing through so­cial con­flict”.</p>
    <p>The project will take place in Fe­bru­ary, with the pub­lic in­vited to speak about its Covid-19 dreams with an in­ter­na­tional team of ex­perts. The con­ver­sa­tions will last about half an hour and will then be con­sid­ered for ac­qui­si­tion.</p>
