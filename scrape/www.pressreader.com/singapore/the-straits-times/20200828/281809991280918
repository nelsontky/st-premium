    <p>Sul­tan Mosque i n Kam­pong Glam will be closed for dis­in­fec­tion today, af­ter a vis­i­tor to the mosque on Aug 18 later tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The mosque will reopen to­mor­row, said the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) last night in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>“The in­fected in­di­vid­ual did not ex­hibit any symp­toms when he vis­ited the mosque, and was only sub­se­quently tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19,” Muis added.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil said that peo­ple who were at the mosque be­tween 2.30pm and 3pm on Aug 18 should mon­i­tor their health un­til Sept 1, and see a doc­tor im­me­di­ately if they feel un­well.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Sheng Siong su­per­mar­ket at Elias Mall and Our Tampines Hub were added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list to get those who were at th­ese places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit. The full list can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied, and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned, if needed.</p>
    <p>There were 77 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,572.</p>
    <p>They in­clude two com­mu­nity cases, both Sin­ga­pore­ans, said MOH.</p>
    <p>One of the com­mu­nity cases is linked to a pre­vi­ous pa­tient and had vis­ited a cam­era shop at Ex­cel­sior Shop­ping Cen­tre, where she may have had con­tact with an­other case who went to work at the shop when he was in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>MOH said the risk of in­fec­tion is low but, as a pre­cau­tion, it will con­tact all in­di­vid­u­als who had vis­ited the shop be­tween Aug 15 and 18, and fa­cil­i­tate Covid-19 test­ing for them.</p>
    <p>The other com­mu­nity case is un­linked.</p>
    <p>There were also five im­ported cases, in­clud­ing an 82-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman who had re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases were placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing i n dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 70 new cases an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from one case two weeks ago, to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
