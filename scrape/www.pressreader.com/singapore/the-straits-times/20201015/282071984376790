    <p>Seven peo­ple linked to Sin­ga­pore ship­build­ing firm Kep­pel Fels were charged yes­ter­day over mul­ti­ple corruption-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>Alvin Lim Wee Lun, 40, who was work­ing as a yard man­ager at the com­pany, was charged with 46 counts of con­spir­ing with two other in­di­vid­u­als to ob­tain bribes to ad­vance the busi­ness in­ter­ests of mul­ti­ple sub­con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>Lim’s co-con­spir­a­tors al­legedly in­cluded Ra­javikra­man Jaya­pan­dian, 45, a project direc­tor at in­dus­trial man­u­fac­tur­ing firm Ro­tary Off­shore So­lu­tions, and Goh Ngak Eng, 54, a direc­tor at Mega­ma­rine Ser­vices, which deals in ma­rine en­gines.</p>
    <p>The of­fences, which in­cluded tak­ing bribes in ex­change for fur­ther­ing the busi­ness in­ter­ests of three com­pa­nies, were com­mit­ted be­tween 2014 and 2017.</p>
    <p>The trio are al­leged to have worked to­gether to ob­tain ap­prox­i­mately $879,900 in bribes from three sub­con­trac­tors, which they in­tended to share.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Goh al­legedly acted as a mid­dle­man, help­ing to ob­tain the gra­tu­ities from the sub­con­trac­tors. The money – which was han­dled by Goh – was then al­legedly split be­tween the trio.</p>
    <p>Ra­javikra­man and Goh also face three ad­di­tional corruption charges each for fur­ther­ing the busi­ness in­ter­ests of a ma­rine equip­ment man­u­fac­turer with an­other com­pany in the same line of busi­ness.</p>
    <p>For help­ing to fa­cil­i­tate these busi­ness deals, Ra­javikra­man had re­ceived a mone­tary re­ward of around $7,000 from Goh.</p>
    <p>Lim, Goh, and Ra­javikra­man are set to ap­pear in court again on Nov 11.</p>
    <p>A Kep­pel Fels spokesman said the com­pany was aware that Lim was be­ing charged with corruption and had dis­missed him last year.</p>
    <p>“We have ex­tended our full co­op­er­a­tion to the au­thor­i­ties and are un­able to com­ment fur­ther as court pro­ceed­ings are on­go­ing. We take a se­ri­ous view of any cor­rupt act and will not tol­er­ate any em­ployee con­duct that is il­le­gal,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Ong Tun Chai, 48, an as­so­ciate of Goh, faces 10 corruption charges for ac­cept­ing a to­tal of $15,100 from Goh as a re­ward for pre­par­ing fic­ti­tious in­voices on a lo­gis­tics com­pany’s let­ter­head.</p>
    <p>Ong is also al­leged to have fraud­u­lently fal­si­fied pa­pers be­long­ing to a lo­gis­tics com­pany on 20 oc­ca­sions and to have is­sued these pa­pers to two sub­con­trac­tors, to re­flect that ser­vices were re­quested by the sub­con­trac­tors when they were not.</p>
    <p>He is due to ap­pear in court again on Nov 4.</p>
    <p>Also taken to task yes­ter­day and charged over mul­ti­ple corruption-re­lated of­fences were the sub­con­trac­tors who al­legedly en­listed the help of Lim, Ra­javikra­man and Goh to ad­vance their firms’ busi­ness in­ter­ests on var­i­ous oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>They are U Keh Choon, 50, a direc­tor at mar­itime equip­ment com­pany Ti­tan Off­shore Equip­ment, Stan­ley Goh Sheng Li, 33, a direc­tor at in­dus­trial sup­plies firm Spec­trama Ma­rine and In­dus­trial Sup­plies, and Fatkul­lah Tiap, 59, man­ag­ing direc­tor of engi­neer­ing and con­sul­tancy com­pany Growa.</p>
    <p>U was charged over seven corruption-re­lated of­fences for al­legedly giv­ing bribes worth $196,700 to the trio.</p>
    <p>Stan­ley Goh Sheng Li was charged with 21 counts of cor­ruptly giv­ing bribes, amount­ing to ap­prox­i­mately $190,900, while Fatkul­lah was charged with 18 counts of cor­ruptly giv­ing grat­i­fi­ca­tion amount­ing to around $492,300.</p>
    <p>U and Fatkul­lah will ap­pear in court on Nov 11 and Stan­ley Goh Sheng Li on Nov 13.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate case in 2018, Kep­pel Off­shore and Ma­rine (Kep­pel O&M) – the par­ent com­pany of Kep­pel Fels – was fined US$422 mil­lion (S$573 mil­lion) for its part in an in­ter­na­tional corruption scandal.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments re­leased by the United States Jus­tice Depart­ment stated that Kep­pel O&M had “know­ingly and wil­fully con­spired” to pay bribes as part of a “decade-long scheme” to win 13 con­tracts with Petro­bras and Sete Brasil – two Brazil­ian oil com­pa­nies that have been un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion since 2014 in a mas­sive graft probe dubbed “Op­er­a­tion Car Wash”.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore adopts a strict zero-tol­er­ance ap­proach to­wards corruption,” said the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies are strongly ad­vised to put in place ro­bust pro­ce­dures in ar­eas such as pro­cure­ment and in­ter­nal au­dit to pre­vent fall­ing vic­tim to cor­rupt acts by their em­ploy­ees.”</p>
    <p>Any per­son who is con­victed of a corruption of­fence can be fined up to $100,000, jailed for up to five years, or both.</p>
