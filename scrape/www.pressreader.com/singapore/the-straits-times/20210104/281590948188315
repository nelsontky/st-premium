    <p>Robin­sons will close its last store at Raf­fles City by Jan 10, bring­ing 162 years of his­tory to an end.</p>
    <p>Liq­uida­tor Korda Men­tha told The Straits Times that while the last day of op­er­a­tion will be no later than next Sun­day, the ac­tual last day may come sooner de­pend­ing on the stock left.</p>
    <p>“Dis­counts will con­tinue to be up­dated daily, not­ing the in­ten­tion is to sell stock down to zero,” said Korda Men­tha on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Some shelves were al­ready empty, while oth­ers were stocked with make-up, bags, shoes and menswear.</p>
    <p>Multi-buy dis­counts were on of­fer, with cus­tomers able to get 80 per cent off the low­est marked price of items with the pur­chase of five items or more.</p>
    <p>Fix­tures and fit­tings such as coat hang­ers, man­nequins and shelves were on sale as well.</p>
    <p>Ms Faith Leong, 19, who vis­ited the Raf­fles City store on New Year’s Day with a friend, said it was a “shame” that the re­tail stal­wart was clos­ing.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment store had an­nounced on Oct 30 last year the clo­sure of its last two out­lets here, say­ing the de­ci­sion to liq­ui­date was prompted by a range of fac­tors, in­clud­ing chang­ing con­sumer tastes and cost pres­sures such as rent.</p>
    <p>Ms Leong, a univer­sity stu­dent, said: “I still re­mem­ber get­ting a dress at Robin­sons when I was a kid. It was so ex­cit­ing be­cause I al­ways got my sis­ter’s hand-me-downs and it was the first time I picked out some­thing new for my­self.”</p>
    <p>For most of the Raf­fles City staff, their last day will be Jan 10.</p>
    <p>A few staff will re­main em­ployed for a short pe­riod to as­sist with ac­count clo­sures and other mat­ters, said Korda Men­tha. From now un­til its last day, the store will re­main open from 11am to 8pm ev­ery day.</p>
