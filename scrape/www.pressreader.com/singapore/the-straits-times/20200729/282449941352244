    <p>One of my big­gest gripes about 2-in-1 con­vert­ibles is their weight.</p>
    <p>Be­cause th­ese hy­brid de­vices – which can eas­ily trans­form between lap­top and tablet forms – have a key­board, they weigh more than a tablet.</p>
    <p>They also have a glass touch­screen, which makes them heav­ier than a sim­i­lar non-touch clamshell note­book.</p>
    <p>PC mak­ers, though, have slimmed down their con­vert­ibles in re­cent years by us­ing light­weight ma­te­ri­als like mag­ne­sium.</p>
    <p>An apt ex­am­ple is the new Acer Spin 5 con­vert­ible. Its mag­ne­siu­ma­lu­minium chas­sis tips the scales at 1.2kg, down from its alu­mini­um­clad pre­de­ces­sor’s 1.5kg.</p>
    <p>The mag­ne­sium-alu­minium body feels more sturdy than an all­mag­ne­sium chas­sis. The key­board and palm rest do not ex­hibit any flex when pres­sure is ap­plied.</p>
    <p>The screen bezels have been slightly re­duced to give the Spin 5 a more con­tem­po­rary look. Over­all, though, it looks bor­ing and non­de­script.</p>
    <p>The notch on the front lip, which helps you grip and lift the lid, both­ers me with its asym­me­try. This notch is aligned with the touch­pad, which is not l ocated cen­trally but slightly to the left.</p>
    <p>This Acer con­vert­ible ap­pears to be tar­geted at mo­bile of­fice work­ers – its 13.5-inch dis­play comes with a 3:2 as­pect ra­tio that of­fers more ver­ti­cal screen real es­tate, un­like its pre­de­ces­sor’s en­ter­tain­ment-cen­tric 16:9 as­pect ra­tio.</p>
    <p>This touch­screen of­fers good view­ing an­gles and is fairly bright. It also uses Wa­com’s ac­tive elec­tro­static tech­nol­ogy which, cou­pled with the in­cluded Acer ac­tive sty­lus (with 4,096 pres­sure-sen­si­tiv­ity lev­els), of­fers an ex­cel­lent pen ex­pe­ri­ence that is re­spon­sive, lag-free and al­most as good as us­ing ac­tual pen and pa­per.</p>
    <p>My only grouse is that the sty­lus is too thin, though this also means the pen can be stored and charged in a stor­age slot on the right side of the Spin 5’s chas­sis.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing this stor­age slot, the Spin 5 still man­ages to cram in a good se­lec­tion of other ports, in­clud­ing two Thun­der­bolt 3 ports, two Type-A USB ports and an HDMI port.</p>
    <p>There is also a mi­croSD card slot, as well as a tra­di­tional bar­rel-type power con­nec­tor, though the con­vert­ible can also be charged through its Thun­der­bolt 3 ports.</p>
    <p>I like that the Spin 5’s speak­ers are lo­cated near the hinges, so they face the user when the con­vert­ible is in its stand mode (with the screen front and cen­tre, while the key­board is face down on the desk).</p>
    <p>But, de­spite the ideal place­ment, th­ese speak­ers are just de­cent at best – they are not as loud as I had ex­pected.</p>
    <p>My review set comes with a midrange In­tel Core i5 pro­ces­sor that has am­ple mem­ory (16GB) and stor­age (1TB solid-state drive).</p>
    <p>It scored 4,084 in the PCMark 10 bench­mark, slightly lower than the score of the more ex­pen­sive In­tel Core i7-pow­ered Mi­crosoft Sur­face Pro 7 (4,233).</p>
    <p>In The Straits Times’ video-loop bat­tery test, the Spin 5 clocked 6 hours and 20 min­utes – de­cent but far from out­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>De­spite its mid­dling looks, the Spin 5 has all the tools to suc­ceed in the con­vert­ible arena, such as its handy form, good se­lec­tion of ports and in­te­grated sty­lus.</p>
