    <p>Maxwell House, which has been around since 1971, is up for col­lec­tive sale with a new mixed-use com­mer­cial and res­i­den­tial project or ho­tel pos­si­bly tak­ing over the site.</p>
    <p>Own­ers of the 13-storey build­ing at 20 Maxwell Road have set a re­serve price of $295 mil­lion, sales con­sul­tant Cush­man & Wake­field said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The block com­prises mainly of­fices and sits on a trape­zoidal is­land site of about 41,801 square feet (sq ft), with views from all four sides of the build­ing.</p>
    <p>The site has a plot ra­tio of 4.3 un­der the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Author­ity’s (URA) Master Plan 2019.</p>
    <p>But Cush­man & Wake­field noted that the URA said in Jan­uary last year that it would sup­port a mixe­duse com­mer­cial and res­i­den­tial devel­op­ment with a 30 per cent higher plot ra­tio of 5.6, and a gross floor area (GFA) of 234,086 sq ft.</p>
    <p>This is sub­ject to a re­zon­ing. An­other caveat is that the com­mer­cial part of the new project must not ex­ceed 20 per cent of the to­tal GFA.</p>
    <p>The al­low­able build­ing height has also been in­creased to 21 storeys.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing 80 per cent of the to­tal GFA is for res­i­den­tial use and the re­main­ing 20 per cent for com­mer­cial, the blended land rate works out to ap­prox­i­mately $1,691 per sq ft (psf) per plot ra­tio.</p>
    <p>This is af­ter fac­tor­ing in a 7 per cent bonus bal­cony plot ra­tio and dif­fer­en­tial pre­mium and es­ti­mated lease up­grad­ing pre­mium for the site.</p>
    <p>Cush­man & Wake­field said the site could be re­de­vel­oped into a ho­tel, with a plot ra­tio 5.6. This op­tion would in­crease the land rate to $1,998 psf per plot ra­tio, also in­clu­sive of the dif­fer­en­tial pre­mium and es­ti­mated lease up­grad­ing pre­mium.</p>
    <p>Maxwell House sits at the fringe of the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict but is also near the con­ser­va­tion shop­house en­claves of Tan­jong Pa­gar and Chi­na­town and within a few min­utes’ walk of Maxwell Food Cen­tre and the Tan­jong Pa­gar and Chi­na­town MRT sta­tions.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing undergroun­d Maxwell MRT sta­tion on the Thom­sonEast Coast Line is expected to be com­pleted in 2022.</p>
    <p>Given that it is in an area com­pris­ing mainly shops, food and bev­er­age out­lets and of­fices, the Maxwell House site will be “one of the rare ex­cep­tional res­i­den­tial plots” avail­able on the market, Cush­man & Wake­field said.</p>
    <p>Ms Christina Sim, di­rec­tor of cap­i­tal mar­kets at Cush­man & Wake­field, said: “Maxwell House is expected to be well-re­ceived as there is a dearth of res­i­den­tial devel­op­ment land in this part of the busi­ness and her­itage dis­trict.”</p>
    <p>She added that it ”will be one of the best ‘work-live-play’ sites to be made avail­able”.</p>
    <p>As the prop­erty is in the cen­tral area, it is not con­strained by guide­lines on the max­i­mum al­low­able num­ber of units cal­cu­lated based on an av­er­age size of 85 square me­tres per unit, Ms Sim added. This means de­vel­op­ers have the flex­i­bil­ity of build­ing stu­dios or dual-key units.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic ten­der closes at 3pm on Nov 12.</p>
