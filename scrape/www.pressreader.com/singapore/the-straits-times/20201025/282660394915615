    <p>As the five-per­son din­ing rule con­tin­ues to be the norm un­til fur­ther no­tice, ground-up ini­tia­tive Hi5SG hopes to get peo­ple to sup­port the lo­cal food and bev­er­age in­dus­try with at­trac­tive dine-in and de­liv­ery deals.</p>
    <p>Th­ese din­ing ex­pe­ri­ences are themed around the num­ber five –</p>
    <p>whether it is a five-course fine-din­ing meal ($95++) at one-Miche­lin­starred Ital­ian restau­rant Braci, or a dis­cov­ery flight of five Amer­i­can whiskeys ($50) at cock­tail bar The Se­cret Mer­maid.</p>
    <p>Other deals in­clude $55 set meals and 55 per cent dis­counts, in a bid to draw cus­tomers back to restau­rants or help them dis­cover new ones.</p>
    <p>The pro­mo­tions by home-grown eater­ies, which kicked off last month and run till Jan 31, can be found on hi5.sg.</p>
    <p>This is a spin-off of the #savefnbsg move­ment that saw more than 600 restau­rant oper­a­tors band­ing to­gether dur­ing the pan­demic. It is also part of the</p>
    <p>Sin­gapo Re­dis­cov­ers move­ment, which aims to give lo­cal life­style and tourism firms a much-needed boost with value-for-money pro­mo­tions and pack­ages for Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>While the deals span restau­rants across the is­land, many are in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District (CBD), which is among the worst-hit ar­eas for F&B busi­nesses be­cause of the lack of tourists and the greatly re­duced of­fice crowd.</p>
    <p>Hi5SG co-founder Lyla Lin, 32, who is also the co-founder of com­mu­ni­ca­tions agency Loop PR, says: “Fine din­ing in the CBD has been heav­ily hit. Tourists will not come in the fore­see­able fu­ture and peo­ple are not rush­ing back to of­fices as well.”</p>
    <p>Restau­ra­teur Beppe de Vito of the ilLido Group, which owns Braci in Boat Quay, says the Hi5SG cam­paign has been ef­fec­tive so far in bring­ing back cus­tomers – both old and new – with a 25 per cent in­crease in foot­fall at the restau­rant.</p>
    <p>He notes that its $95 five-course set menu has had 135 re­demp­tions in the past five weeks since the cam­paign started.</p>
    <p>“We have also seen an in­crease of 20 per cent for the aver­age spend and that al­most 10 per cent of pa­trons who make a reser­va­tion at our restau­rants via Hi5SG are not from our usual crowd,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“Our Hi5SG ex­pe­ri­ences have been do­ing very well and, given how ac­ces­si­ble the pro­mo­tion is, more new din­ers are giv­ing fine din­ing a try, when they wouldn’t nor­mally.”</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pat­ing es­tab­lish­ments have also pledged part of their pro­ceeds to Hi5SG’s of­fi­cial ben­e­fi­ciary =Dreams (dream­sa­sia.org), an in­ten­sive ed­u­ca­tional pro­gramme for un­der­priv­i­leged chil­dren by the South Cen­tral Com­mu­nity Fam­ily Ser­vice Centre.</p>
    <p>It pro­vides af­ter-school en­rich­ment and holis­tic devel­op­men­tal sup­port for chil­dren from l ow­in­come fam­i­lies in Hous­ing Board rental flats to pre­pare them for ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Hi5SG aims to raise a to­tal of $300,000 for =DREAMS.</p>
