    <p>Fam­ily mem­bers of a 14-year-old boy ac­cused of mur­der­ing his father have en­gaged lawyers to rep­re­sent the teenager.</p>
    <p>They are Mr Shashi Nathan, Mr Jeremy Pereira and Ms J. Jay­aletchmi from law firm Withers Khat­tarWong.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Mr Nathan is also one of the lawyers rep­re­sent­ing Ah­mad Da­nial Mo­hamed Rafa’ee, 35, who is ac­cused of mur­der­ing Ms Feli­cia Teo Wei Ling, 19, in 2007.</p>
    <p>The 14-year-old boy’s case was men­tioned at the Youth Courts yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Nathan told The Straits Times that the teen will be re­manded at a boys’ home and his case has been ad­journed to next Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Details about the boy and his fam­ily can­not be re­vealed as those un­der 18 are cov­ered un­der the Chil­dren and Young Per­sons Act.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean boy is ac­cused of mur­der­ing his 49-yearold father in a unit at the Edel­weiss Park con­do­minium in Flora Road near Loyang Av­enue at around 10am on Dec 11 last year.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier state­ment, the po­lice said: “Upon ar­rival, of­fi­cers found the man in­jured and ly­ing mo­tion­less at the said lo­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>The man was taken un­con­scious to Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, where he later died. The boy was then ar­rested at the scene.</p>
    <p>Those found guilty of mur­der could re­ceive the death penalty.</p>
    <p>How­ever, those be­low 18 would not get the death sen­tence, but could be given life im­pris­on­ment in­stead.</p>
