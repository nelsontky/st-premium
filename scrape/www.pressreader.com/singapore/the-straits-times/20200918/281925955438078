    <p>MOSCOW • The nerve agent used to poi­son Rus­sian op­po­si­tion leader Alexei Navalny was de­tected on an empty wa­ter bot­tle from his ho­tel room in the Siberian city of Tomsk, sug­gest­ing he was poi­soned there and not at the air­port as first thought, his team said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny fell vi­o­lently ill on a flight in Rus­sia last month and was air­lifted to Ber­lin for treat­ment. Lab­o­ra­to­ries in Ger­many, France and Swe­den have es­tab­lished he was poi­soned by a Novi­chok nerve agent, a poi­son de­vel­oped by the So</p>
    <p>viet mil­i­tary, though Rus­sia de­nies this and says it has seen no ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>A video posted on Mr Navalny’s In­sta­gram ac­count showed mem­bers of his team search­ing the room he had left in the Xan­der Ho­tel in Tomsk on Aug 20, an hour af­ter they learnt he had fallen sick in sus­pi­cious cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>“It was de­cided to gather up ev­ery­thing that could even hy­po­thet­i­cally be use­ful and hand them to the doc­tors in Ger­many,” the post said.</p>
    <p>The video shows two wa­ter bot­tles on a desk, and an­other on a bed­side ta­ble. Mr Navalny’s team, wear­ing pro­tec­tive gloves, are seen plac­ing items into blue plas­tic bags.</p>
    <p>“Two weeks later, a Ger­man lab­o­ra­tory found traces of Novi­chok pre­cisely on the bot­tle of wa­ter from the Tomsk ho­tel room,” the post said. “And then more lab­o­ra­to­ries that took analy­ses from Alexei con­firmed that that was what poi­soned Navalny.”</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, Mr Navalny’s aides had said they sus­pected he had been poi­soned with a cup of tea he drank at Tomsk air­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Vladimir Milov, a for­mer en­ergy vice-min­is­ter and an ally of Mr Navalny, said his team had out­ma­noeu­vred the po­lice with their quick think­ing: “They took the ev­i­dence from un­der their noses and shipped it out of the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny is the most prom­i­nent po­lit­i­cal op­po­nent of Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin. His in­ves­ti­ga­tions of of­fi­cial cor­rup­tion, pub­lished on YouTube and In­sta­gram, have reached au­di­ences of many mil­lions across Rus­sia.</p>
