    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has added more lunches and also din­ners for its Restau­rant A380 @ Changi din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, af­ter the ini­tial 900-odd seats avail­able were sold out within 30 min­utes af­ter book­ings opened at mid­night on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It had of­fered lunches on its A-380 planes on Oct 24 and 25.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post last night, the air­line an­nounced that it would add lunches on two more days – Oct 31 and Nov 1 – as well as din­ners on all four days.</p>
    <p>Thank­ing cus­tomers for their “over­whelm­ing sup­port”, SIA said it has re­opened a wait list for cus­tomers who could not make a reser­va­tion af­ter 12.30am yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Those on the wait list will be con­tacted if more seats are avail­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Lik Hsin, SIA ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent (com­mer­cial), said: “We are grate­ful for the ex­tremely strong sup­port from our cus­tomers, and we look for­ward to wel­com­ing them to Restau­rant A380 @ Changi.”</p>
    <p>Among those who man­aged to buy a lunch ticket was Ms Amy Tay.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old au­di­tor, who con­sid­ers her­self a loyal SIA fan, said she got a suite ticket for her­self and her one-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets for chil­dren aged two and be­low can be pur­chased for $1.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Tay: “I might never get a chance to fly as an SIA Suites Class pas­sen­ger, and thought this would be a once-in-a-life­time op­por­tu­nity for me to ex­pe­ri­ence this cabin prod­uct.”</p>
    <p>She said it will be her daugh­ter’s first time in an air­craft, and hopes her pur­chase would help sup­port the air­line amid what has been a try­ing pe­riod for the avi­a­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The three-hour lunches and din­ners will cost $50 in the econ­omy cabin, $90 for those who wish to sit</p>
    <p>I might never get a chance to fly as an SIA Suites Class pas­sen­ger, and thought this would be a once-in-a-life­time op­por­tu­nity for me to ex­pe­ri­ence this cabin prod­uct.</p>
    <p>in the pre­mium econ­omy cabin, $300 for busi­ness class and $600 for the suites.</p>
    <p>Scalpers started to list tick­ets for re­sale on on­line mar­ket­place Carousell yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>One list­ing of­fered two adult tick­ets in the econ­omy class for $188, while an­other was ask­ing for $3,000 in to­tal for two suite tick­ets.</p>
    <p>On Sept 28, SIA said that mem­bers of the pub­lic could still ex­pe­ri­ence the air­line’s ser­vice – al­beit on the ground – through three ini­tia­tives that would be launched.</p>
    <p>Two A-380 planes parked at Changi Air­port will be con­verted into a restau­rant. While the su­per­jumbo can carry up to 471 pas­sen­gers, only about half the seats will be filled, for safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The menu will fea­ture in­ter­na­tional cuisines and a Per­anakan menu cus­tomised for the tem­po­rary restau­rant. Each meal will come with two free al­co­holic drinks and a free flow of other bev­er­ages.</p>
    <p>Din­ers will get other perks, such as KrisShop dis­counts and a goodie bag. Those who turn up in traditiona­l her­itage wear, such as sarong ke­baya, cheongsam or sari, will get an ex­tra gift.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures to re­duce the spread of Covid-19 in­clude clean­ing and sani­tis­ing the plane, cap­ping group sizes at five, im­ple­ment­ing safe dis­tanc­ing and do­ing a tem­per­a­ture check.</p>
    <p>Crew and din­ers will be re­quired to wear a face mask at all times when on board, ex­cept when eat­ing or drink­ing.</p>
    <p>SIA is also of­fer­ing a tour of its train­ing fa­cil­i­ties and home de­liv­ery of meals from its first-class and busi­ness-class menus.</p>
