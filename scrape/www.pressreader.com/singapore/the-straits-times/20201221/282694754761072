    <p>Bak­ing is not just for adults.</p>
    <p>Kids can have fun mak­ing cook­ies and cakes while pick­ing up aca­demic con­cepts and life skills.</p>
    <p>For Dr Su­sanne Ng, 40, a for­mer sci­en­tist pop­u­lar on so­cial me­dia for her chif­fon cakes, which take the shape of car­toon char­ac­ters like Hello Kitty and Pusheen, bak­ing is a reg­u­lar home ac­tiv­ity she en­joys with her daugh­ters Chris­tine, nine, and Charissa, six, who love mak­ing cook­ies and mac­arons. Her 11-yearold son Caleb joins in oc­ca­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>“Kids learn re­ally fast and they also can un­der­stand well if you ex­plain ev­ery step to them,” says Dr Ng, who holds a PhD in biomed­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing and pre­vi­ously worked at re­search agency A*Star.</p>
    <p>As bak­ing re­quires pre­cise mea­sure­ments (“like a re­searcher do­ing a lab­o­ra­tory test”), it be­came a fun way for Dr Ng to teach her chil­dren math­e­mat­ics con­cepts such as adding, sub­tract­ing and di­vid­ing.</p>
    <p>It helps kids un­der­stand se­quenc­ing and plan­ning as “none of the steps can be skipped”, says Dr Ng, who has writ­ten four recipe books.</p>
    <p>The young ones also learn life skills such as pa­tience. While it can take as lit­tle as 30 min­utes to make cook­ies, cakes can take hours while bread may re­quire up to a day.</p>
    <p>Then there is per­se­ver­ance. “It takes prac­tice to achieve the de­sired out­come. The kids must be ready to face a few fail­ures,” she says.</p>
    <p>This year, she is work­ing with Ja­panese com­pany San­rio to teach on­line classes on mak­ing cakes in the shape of My Melody, Lit­tle Twin Stars and the most fa­mous San­rio char­ac­ter of them all, Hello Kitty.</p>
    <p>She shares sug­ges­tions on how you can in­tro­duce bak­ing to kids:</p>
    <p>For tod­dlers: Make some cup­cakes and let the kids dec­o­rate them with colour­ful sprin­kles and fruit top­pings. They can get creative with their de­signs and have lots of fun.</p>
    <p>For pre-school­ers: Try no-bake recipes such as those for snowskin moon­cakes. Let them knead, pull and shape the dough. This makes for a good sen­sory ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>For pri­mary school­ers: Start with sim­ple recipes so they can be in­volved from start to end. They can mea­sure the in­gre­di­ents, do sim­ple mix­ing and dec­o­rate their work. When they are more con­fi­dent at bak­ing, teach them ad­vanced tech­niques such as fold­ing the right way so the bat­ter will not be de­flated. Elisa Chia</p>
