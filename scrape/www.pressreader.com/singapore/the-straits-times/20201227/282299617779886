    <p>By Hi­lary Man­tel</p>
    <p>Fourth Es­tate/Pa­per­back/883 pages/ $29.95/Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>Bri­tish author Man­tel brings her his­tor­i­cal tril­ogy on Thomas Cromwell, the ruth­less right-hand man of King Henry VIII, to an epic fi­nale.</p>
    <p>Span­ning four years and at least three of Henry’s queens – from the be­headed Anne Bo­leyn to the re­jected Anne of Cleves – the novel chron­i­cles Cromwell’s fall from grace and ends in his ex­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Man­tel seems dis­in­clined to ar­rive at the end­ing his­tory laid out for her – she lets the nar­ra­tive me­an­der for nearly 900 pages of court in­trigue, the­o­log­i­cal twists and a monarch’s wax­ing mega­lo­ma­nia. Yet it is all so richly ren­dered, you can hardly be­grudge her a word.</p>

    <p>THE SHADOW KING</p>
    <p>By Maaza Mengiste (above) Canon­gate/Pa­per­back/429 pages/ $21.95/Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>Ethiopian-Amer­i­can Mengiste’s Booker-short­listed novel throws into sharp relief the ob­scure story of the Ethiopian women sol­diers who fought an in­vad­ing Ital­ian army in 1935.</p>
    <p>Hirut, an or­phan, be­comes a ser­vant to war­lord Ki­dane, whose wife Aster treats the young woman vi­ciously out of j eal­ousy. When dic­ta­tor Ben­ito Mussolini’s army at­tacks and the Ethiopian king goes into hid­ing, Hirut, Aster and other women take up arms in a des­per­ate at­tempt to de­fend their coun­try.</p>
    <p>With bru­tal, beautiful writ­ing, Mengiste el­e­vates the Ethiopian strug­gle to myth­i­cal lev­els in this stir­ring tale of sur­vival.</p>
    <p>3 HAM­NET</p>
    <p>By Mag­gie O’Far­rell Head­line/Pa­per­back/368 pages/ $29.95/Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>Ir­ish author O’Far­rell won the Women’s Prize for Fic­tion with this un­can­nily timely work, a plague novel for a plague year.</p>
    <p>It cen­tres on Wil­liam Shake­speare’s fam­ily with­out nam­ing the fa­mous play­wright, fo­cus­ing in­stead on the wife and chil­dren he left in Strat­ford, Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Shake­speare’s son Ham­net died at the age of 11 from the bubonic plague. O’Far­rell draws a link be­tween this and the Bard’s cel­e­brated play Ham­let and paints an evoca­tive por­trait of a fam­ily’s grief, as well as the tiny twists of fate that cause sick­ness to spread in­vis­i­bly and in­ex­orably.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>UTOPIA AV­ENUE</p>
    <p>By David Mitchell Scep­tre/Pa­per­back/563 pages/ $29.95/Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish author of Cloud At­las (2004) takes read­ers on a psy­che­delic nostal­gia trip to the Lon­don of the Swing­ing Six­ties.</p>
    <p>Utopia Av­enue, an eclec­tic, genre-bend­ing band, defy a rocky start to achieve a me­te­oric rise to fame, cul­mi­nat­ing in a tri­umphant tour of Amer­ica that ends in tragedy.</p>
    <p>Mitchell pulls off some pitch­per­fect writ­ing about music here, while daz­zling the reader with a who’s who of cameos from the decade’s mu­si­cians, from Leonard Co­hen in an el­e­va­tor at the Chelsea Ho­tel to Ja­nis Jo­plin dish­ing the dirt on in­dus­try sex­ism at a party.</p>

    <p>HOW THE MAN IN GREEN SAVED PA­HANG, AND POS­SI­BLY THE WORLD By Joshua Kam</p>
    <p>Epi­gram Books/Pa­per­back/</p>
    <p>296 pages/$26.64/</p>
    <p>Huggs-Epi­gram Cof­fee Book­shop</p>
    <p>A prophet in green per­suades a Chris­tian can­tor to go on a mad­cap road trip across Malaysia with him, just as a young woman re­turns from Amer­ica to Pa­hang to bury the great-aunt who raised her, only to dis­cover se­crets in the dead woman’s ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Kam, who won the fifth Epi­gram Books Fic­tion Prize with this novel, de­liv­ers a breath­lessly ex­u­ber­ant romp through the myths and pan­theons of “rebel Malaysias” in this dizzy­ing tale of fe­male com­mu­nist fight­ers, mu­seum heists and high­ways of gold in the sky.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>PIRANESI</p>
    <p>By Su­sanna Clarke Blooms­bury/Hard­cover/245 pages/ $29.95/Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>Af­ter 16 years of si­lence since her best-sell­ing fan­tasy de­but Jonathan Strange & Mr Nor­rell (2004), Bri­tish author Clarke re­turns with this strange, splen­did novel about a man called Piranesi who lives in the House, a ruin of un­end­ing halls, stair­ways and stat­ues which, to him, con­sti­tutes the whole world.</p>
    <p>Piranesi ekes out a prim­i­tive, iso­lated ex­is­tence, vis­ited only by an­other per­son he calls the Other, whom he helps with sci­en­tific re­search. He does not – or can­not – leave the House, some­thing which will un­doubt­edly res­onate with read­ers in lock­down.</p>
    <p>Yet he finds mean­ing in his iso­la­tion. “May your Paths be safe, your Floors un­bro­ken, and may the House fill your eyes with Beauty,” he says.</p>
    <p>It is a good wish to carry into the new year.</p>

    <p>THE LY­ING LIFE OF ADULTS</p>
    <p>By Elena Fer­rante, trans­lated by</p>
    <p>Ann Gold­stein</p>
    <p>Europa Edi­tions/Pa­per­back/</p>
    <p>442 pages/$32.10/Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>“Two years be­fore leav­ing home, my fa­ther said to my mother that I was very ugly.” Fer­rante, the pseudony­mous Ital­ian author of the feted Neapoli­tan nov­els (2012 to 2015), hits the reader right be­tween the eyes with this stun­ner of an open­ing para­graph.</p>
    <p>What fol­lows is an un­flinch­ing, unerring de­pic­tion of fe­male ado­les­cence, as the nar­ra­tor, Gio­vanna, strays from her com­fort­able life to seek out her es­tranged aunt in the depths of work­ing-class Naples. Fer­rante, as ever, ex­cels in her han­dling of com­plex fe­male re­la­tion­ships and sex­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>8 A PROMISED LAND</p>
    <p>By Barack Obama Crown/Hard­cover/751 pages/$72.92/ Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>Hands down the big­gest book of 2020, the mem­oir of the for­mer United States pres­i­dent has proven to be a boon for book­sell­ers world­wide, sell­ing more than three mil­lion copies in just over a month.</p>
    <p>The first of two vol­umes, it charts Obama’s path to the White House and chron­i­cles the mak­ings of a his­toric pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Al­ready a no­table bib­lio­phile, Obama proves a skil­ful wielder of the pen him­self in his riv­et­ing ac­counts of po­lit­i­cal machi­na­tions and in­sights into the work­ings of democ­racy.</p>
    <p>9 SUM­MER</p>
    <p>By Ali Smith (above)</p>
    <p>Hamish Hamil­ton/Pa­per­back/</p>
    <p>385 pages/$32.10/Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>The fi­nal in­stal­ment of Scot­tish author Smith’s Brexit sea­sonal quartet brings the heat. Rushed out amid the sum­mer of the world’s Covid-19 lock­down, it is that rare work of art that has kept pace with the times that forged it.</p>
    <p>Smith presses up against the present and free­wheels through the past all at once, weav­ing to­gether ev­ery­thing from physi­cist Al­bert Ein­stein to the mi­gra­tory pat­terns of swifts.</p>
    <p>In the process, she shows the crises of the world – not just the pan­demic, but also xeno­pho­bia, mi­gra­tion and cli­mate change – to be an in­ter­locked col­lage.</p>
    <p>10 SHUG­GIE BAIN</p>
    <p>By Dou­glas Stu­art (above) Pi­cador/Pa­per­back/433 pages/ $29.95/Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>This bleak com­ing-of-age tale, in­spired by Scot­tish author Stu­art’s own childhood, won the Booker Prize for its faith­ful, har­row­ing por­trait of a fam­ily in 1980s work­ing-class Glas­gow, af­flicted by poverty, vi­o­lence and ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Shug­gie, a sweet child who is bul­lied for be­ing dif­fer­ent, moves to the grim min­ing com­mu­nity of Pit­head, where his cheat­ing fa­ther aban­dons his charis­matic, al­co­holic mother. Her love for her son wars with her ad­dic­tion, mak­ing for a truly heart-break­ing read that shines a light on of­ten-over­looked lives.</p>
