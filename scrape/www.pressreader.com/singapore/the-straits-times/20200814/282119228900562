    <p>Its net gear­ing ra­tio was 8.5 per cent as of Dec 31 last year. Its gross gear­ing ra­tio was 14.2 per cent as of June 30 this year, ver­sus 14.6 per cent as of Dec 31 last year.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, its di­rec­tors said “the full eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic is still un­fold­ing”. They ex­pect tran­sit rev­enue to be lower com­pared with last year as rid­er­ship re­mains low.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from other com­mer­cial ac­tiv­i­ties such as re­tail is ex­pected to be “chal­leng­ing” be­cause of fewer peo­ple at train sta­tions and bus in­ter­changes.</p>
    <p>Re­pairs and main­te­nance costs are ex­pected to in­crease with the on­go­ing mid-life re­fur­bish­ment of the NEL and the Sengkang-Pung­gol LRT.</p>
    <p>“The ad­verse im­pact of Covid-19... will be par­tially cush­ioned by grants from gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes,” SBS Tran­sit noted.</p>
    <p>But it added that the out­look will worsen if there is a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In the light of the un­cer­tain­ties, SBS Tran­sit is not pay­ing an in­terim div­i­dend – a rare oc­cur­rence. At the same time last year, it paid 7.15 cents per share in div­i­dend.</p>
    <p>Agri and food gi­ant Olam In­ter­na­tional saw a 44.4 per cent rise in net profit to $332.7 mil­lion for the first half of the year ended June 30, from $230.4 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>This was due to a com­bi­na­tion of a net ex­cep­tional gain of $130.6 mil­lion from the group’s divest­ments of the re­main­ing half stake in Far East Agri and the par­tial stake sale of ARISE P&L, but was off­set par­tially by one­off exit and clo­sure costs of other de-pri­ori­tised as­sets that were di­vested or shut down.</p>
    <p>Al­though rev­enue for the pe­riod rose 7.1 per cent to $17.1 bil­lion from $15.9 bil­lion last year, earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est and taxes fell by 18.8 per cent. This was due to lower con­tri­bu­tions from the Olam Food In­gre­di­ents (OFI) seg­ment be­cause of re­duced con­tri­bu­tion from the al­monds, hazel­nuts and co­coa pro­cess­ing busi­nesses – which were af­fected by ad­verse prices and mar­gin pres­sures re­sult­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The group at­trib­uted the rev­enue in­crease to vol­ume growth as well as higher av­er­age sell­ing prices.</p>
    <p>This is the first time Olam is re­port­ing re­sults for its newly formed op­er­at­ing groups – OFI, Olam Global Agri (OGA) and Olam In­ter­na­tional Limited (OIL) – fol­low­ing its re­or­gan­i­sa­tion, which was aimed at sim­pli­fy­ing its busi­nesses in or­der to sharpen its fo­cus.</p>
    <p>For the first half of the year, OFI and OGA saw their rev­enues rise 8.8 per cent and 8.4 per cent year on year re­spec­tively, while OIL – par­ent com­pany of both OFI and OGA – saw rev­enue slip 14.6 per cent on the back of clo­sure of the sugar, rub­ber and fer­tiliser trad­ing desk, the fun­da­men­tal fund and wood prod­ucts busi­ness in Latin Amer­ica. Olam said each of the new op­er­at­ing groups is en­gaged in de­vel­op­ing a full po­ten­tial strate­gic plan and a cost and cap­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion plan that will al­low the group to “un­lock and max­imise long-term value”.</p>
    <p>The board of di­rec­tors has de­clared a one-tier tax-ex­empt in­terim div­i­dend of 3.5 cents, un­changed from the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod a year ago. The div­i­dend is slated to be paid out on Aug 28.</p>
    <p>As at June 30, Olam had cash and cash equiv­a­lents of $5.76 bil­lion. The group said its dis­ci­pline in proac­tively con­trol­ling costs, con­serv­ing cash and man­ag­ing its cap­i­tal struc­ture helped it gen­er­ate free cash flow to eq­uity of $826.9 mil­lion in the first half of the year.</p>
    <p>Net gear­ing re­mained steady at 1.29 times de­spite higher net debt with an ad­justed gear­ing of 0.34 times net of read­ily mar­ketable in­ven­tory and se­cured re­ceiv­ables.</p>
    <p>Olam said Covid-19 has “ad­versely im­pacted” some of its busi­ness seg­ments, and ex­pects its per­for­mance in H2 to “con­se­quently re­cover and show bet­ter re­sults”.</p>
    <p>Olam chief ex­ec­u­tive Sunny Vergh­ese said: “While the year ahead will re­main chal­leng­ing and un­cer­tain with a range of out­comes that could im­pact de­mand and sup­ply con­di­tions across ge­ogra­phies, busi­nesses and fi­nan­cial mar­kets, we re­main con­fi­dent in the strength of our busi­ness model to emerge stronger from this cri­sis.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">SBS Tran&#xAD;sit said that in the first six months of this year, av&#xAD;er&#xAD;age rail rid&#xAD;er&#xAD;ship fell by over 40 per cent for the MRT and over 30 per cent for the LRT. This was par&#xAD;tially off&#xAD;set by av&#xAD;er&#xAD;age fares, which were 14.7 per cent higher for the Down&#xAD;town Line, 16.6 per cent higher for the North East Line (right), and 8.7 per cent higher for the SengkangPu&#xAD;ng&#xAD;gol LRT.</p>
