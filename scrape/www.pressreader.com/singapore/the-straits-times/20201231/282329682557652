    <p>Some 665kg of cannabis that was seized by the authoritie­s in Viet­nam did not pass through or orig­i­nate from Sin­ga­pore, con­trary to what some for­eign me­dia had re­ported, the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bu­reau (CNB) said.</p>
    <p>Its in­ves­ti­ga­tions had found that the con­tainer de­parted from a Euro­pean coun­try and passed through an­other port of call be­fore ar­riv­ing at Hai Phong city on Dec 11, it said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Viet­namese news­pa­per VnEx­press had re­ported on Dec 23 that the drugs had come from a sender in Sin­ga­pore, and were sent to Takan Viet­nam Trad­ing Stock Com­pany in Hanoi.</p>
    <p>It was also re­ported that the con­tainer, which was trans­ported by ves­sel to Hai Phong city in Viet­nam, car­ried pack­ages con­tain­ing com­modi­ties used as raw ma­te­ri­als for an­i­mal feed pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The con­tainer was later moved to an in­dus­trial park in Hai Phong city for repack­ag­ing, when the Viet­namese authoritie­s dis­cov­ered the cannabis pack­ages.</p>
    <p>“The con­tainer in which the cannabis pack­ages were found did not pass through or orig­i­nate from Sin­ga­pore. Nonethe­less, CNB will con­tinue to work closely with our for­eign coun­ter­parts against transna­tional drug traf­fick­ing ac­tiv­i­ties,” CNB said in a state­ment.</p>
