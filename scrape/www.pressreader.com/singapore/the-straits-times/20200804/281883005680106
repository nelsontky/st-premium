    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Whether you find him ad­mirable or ob­nox­ious, bil­lion­aire Elon Musk is hav­ing a fan­tas­tic year.</p>
    <p>SpaceX, the com­pany he founded in 2002, blasted two Amer­i­can astro­nauts to the In­ter­na­tional Space Sta­tion in late May and brought them safely home in a his­toric splash­down on Sun­day, herald­ing a new age of pri­vate sec­tor space travel.</p>
    <p>Tesla, his elec­tric car­maker, re­cently cel­e­brated its fourth straight quar­ter of profit and may soon join the S&P 500 In­dex. This year’s share rally has made the Cal­i­for­nia com­pany the world’s most valu­able au­tomaker, with a mar­ket value of roughly US$267 bil­lion (S$368 bil­lion) as of last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>And then there is Mr Musk him­self. The 49-yearold South African im­mi­grant, who is a Los An­ge­les­based celebrity as much as a Sil­i­con Val­ley CEO, is now the 10th rich­est per­son in the world, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>While the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cers of the Big Four tech com­pa­nies – Ama­zon, Ap­ple, Face­book and Google – were de­rided as “cy­ber barons” dur­ing a grilling by Congress last week on an­titrust is­sues, Mr Musk basked in Style-sec­tion treat­ment in the Sun­day New York Times.</p>
    <p>It is a re­mark­able re­ver­sal from the dark days of 2018, when Tesla strug­gled to ramp up pro­duc­tion of the Model 3 sedan, scores of ex­ec­u­tives quit and Mr Musk was sued by the US Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion over his in­fa­mous “go pri­vate” tweet. But he has not en­deared him­self to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk has come un­der fire for down­play­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, tweet­ing in early March that “coro­n­avirus panic is dumb” and then pre­dict­ing the US would prob­a­bly have “close to zero new cases” by the end of April.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia, where Tesla’s auto plant em­ploys about 10,000 work­ers, Mr Musk de­fied the pub­lic health au­thor­i­ties by clos­ing down the fa­cil­ity late and re­open­ing it early, dar­ing any­one to ar­rest him.</p>
    <p>Yet in a year when much of the nation is hun­kered down or re­trench­ing in the face of surg­ing virus in­fec­tions and wide­spread eco­nomic anx­i­ety, Mr Musk is ebul­lient and ex­pand­ing. Tesla, which has 55,000 em­ploy­ees glob­ally, is hir­ing and is build­ing a new auto plant in Austin, Texas, for its forth­com­ing elec­tric pick-up truck.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk sug­gested last Fri­day that Tesla’s work­force could grow to 65,000 by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>“We’re full of ad­mi­ra­tion” for the whole team at Tesla, Mr James An­der­son of Scot­tish money man­ager Bail­lie Gif­ford, Tesla’s se­cond-largest share­holder af­ter Mr Musk him­self, said in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>Bail­lie Gif­ford de­clined to com­ment on the suc­cess of SpaceX, in which it is also an in­vestor. Mr Musk’s pri­vately held com­pany, which is in the midst of rais­ing US$1 bil­lion in funds, is among the most valu­able ven­ture-backed com­pa­nies in the US.</p>
    <p>SpaceX – for­mally Space Ex­plo­ration Tech­nolo­gies – is best known for launch­ing the Fal­con 9 re­us­able rocket for cus­tomers that in­clude com­mer­cial satel­lite op­er­a­tors, the Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (Nasa) and the US mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess­ful flight of astro­nauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hur­ley marks the first time that SpaceX has flown hu­mans – a huge proof point for a firm founded with the goal of colonis­ing Mars.</p>
    <p>“Wel­come back to Planet Earth and thanks for fly­ing SpaceX,” said Mis­sion Con­trol, af­ter the astro­nauts in the Dragon cap­sule splashed down in the Gulf of Mex­ico. Con­grat­u­la­tions also poured in via Twit­ter from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his pre­de­ces­sor Barack Obama, as well as com­peti­tors like Blue Ori­gin and Boe­ing.</p>
    <p>Now that the “Demo-1” test flight is com­plete, SpaceX can be­gin op­er­a­tional trips for Nasa. The Crew-1 mis­sion is planned for late Septem­ber. SpaceX is also test­ing Star­ship, the next-gen­er­a­tion rocket that will fly hu­mans to the Moon and then Mars. It is also pre­par­ing to launch its own space­based In­ter­net ser­vice called Star­link.</p>
    <p>And later this month, Mr Musk vows to give a “progress up­date” on Neu­ralink, his brain-ma­chine in­ter­face start-up.</p>
