    <p>The Sino-Amer­i­can ri­valry is grow­ing in many ar­eas, and wrap­ping these con­tentious is­sues within a war nar­ra­tive risks mak­ing things worse. If wag­ing “war” hob­bles China’s re­turn to growth, or dis­tracts Amer­i­cans from their do­mes­tic chal­lenges, great harm re­sults – not only on the two coun­tries di­rectly, but also on all oth­ers and the over­all in­ter­na­tional sys­tem, says As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Si­mon Tay.</p>
    <p>Talk is grow­ing about a “New Cold War”, or even out­right war, be­tween the United States and China. This im­pacts not only the two giants. It rip­ples to coun­tries in be­tween, as seen in the meet­ing of for­eign min­is­ters con­vened last week by Asean.</p>
    <p>While Asean had a much wider agenda of its own pri­or­i­ties, the com­pet­ing claims in the South China Sea came par­tic­u­larly in fo­cus. There was, more­over, con­sid­er­able fin­ger point­ing be­tween the US and China, which strained the unity and con­sen­sus of the group.</p>
    <p>There is no deny­ing that Sino-Amer­i­can ri­valry spans many sec­tors, from pol­i­tics and se­cu­rity to trade and tech­nol­ogy. It is also true that dif­fer­ences are ac­cel­er­at­ing and di­rect (if lim­ited) con­flict can­not be ruled out. Yet, Asean and other coun­tries must re­sist the anal­ogy of war. Such a mind­set risks fo­cus­ing on the wrong things. They must seek ways that al­low space in be­tween.</p>
    <p>AMER­I­CAN WAR NAR­RA­TIVES</p>
    <p>The US has made no for­mal dec­la­ra­tion of war since 1942 for World War II. But some Amer­i­cans still seem to love the word. It is ap­plied not only to con­flicts in Korea, Viet­nam and the Gulf, but also the “war on ter­ror”, when there is no op­po­nent state. Even ef­forts against the pan­demic are dubbed “war” – with­out a hu­man en­emy.</p>
    <p>Per­haps cry­ing “war” is sim­ply a way to rally peo­ple and re­call past vic­to­ries. But the word is more than se­man­tics.</p>
    <p>War’s drum­beat shapes how so­ci­ety recog­nises and pro­cesses in­for­ma­tion, and ral­lies cit­i­zens to ac­cept and sup­port con­flict – as shown in stud­ies like Analo­gies At War by Pro­fes­sor Khong Yuen Foong (now with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy).</p>
    <p>In re­cent writ­ing, Prof Khong con­sid­ers that a “Cold War 2.0” frame­work with a bipo­lar Asia is on the cards. Un­der these cir­cum­stances, ten­sions could be man­aged, “frozen” so that ma­jor mil­i­tary con­flict can be pre­vented and be the lesser of evils. But such a war stance can prove slip­pery from cold to hot, with se­ri­ous con­se­quences for those caught up in it.</p>
    <p>Re­call that dur­ing World War II, no bomb landed on con­ti­nen­tal US (the sole Amer­i­can tar­get was Pearl Har­bour in Hawaii). The Cold War wit­nessed tense stand-offs across</p>
    <p>Eu­rope and the Cuban mis­sile cri­sis, but the hot con­flicts were in proxy wars, such as in Korea and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>To Amer­i­cans, “war” is mostly fought else­where. But to those else­where, there can be real dam­age. What seems cold in one place can run hot in oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Think­ing in terms of “war” em­pha­sises and le­git­imises break­ing the nor­mal rules. The im­per­a­tive is to win at all costs. Rules and in­ter­na­tional law, al­ready too of­ten bro­ken by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, are seen as mere hin­drances.</p>
    <p>A third ten­dency of talk­ing war is to paint the sit­u­a­tion in black and white, be­tween “good guys” and “vil­lains”. There can be no moral equiv­a­lence or ef­fort to un­der­stand the other side, let alone of­fer com­pro­mise. The war anal­ogy shapes a stark di­chotomy, a one-off choice in which a great power asks other states “whether you are for us or against us”.</p>
    <p>For the coun­tries caught in be­tween, ag­ile and ra­tio­nal diplo­macy can be read as ap­pease­ment and com­plic­ity. Neu­tral­ity be­comes cow­ardly, and au­ton­omy im­pos­si­ble. For ev­ery one Switzer­land, oth­ers risk be­com­ing like Fin­land – so painfully caught be­tween the Soviet Union and Hitler’s Ger­many in the years be­fore and af­ter World War II.</p>
    <p>THROUGH THE FOG OF ‘WAR’</p>
    <p>Coun­tries caught be­tween the great pow­ers must re­sist the pres­sure to ally per­ma­nently with one side or the other.</p>
    <p>Take the state­ment on the South China Sea, is­sued just af­ter the Asean meet­ings among for­eign min­is­ters. Asean cor­rectly called for the con­tested area not to be mil­i­tarised. But it re­frained from nam­ing China. Nor did Asean re­fer to the in­creased US “free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion” pa­trols in the dis­puted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>The US, how­ever, did not pull its punches. Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo de­clared China’s claims “com­pletely un­law­ful” and called for a boy­cott of com­pa­nies linked to con­struc­tion work in the dis­puted ar­eas. China’s top diplo­mat Wang Yi, on his part, ac­cused the US of be­ing the big­gest driver of mil­i­tari­sa­tion of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, the rule of law should pro­vide the bedrock of what a state can or can­not do, and China’s ac­tions in the South China Sea have come un­der crit­i­cism for breach­ing the United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea (Un­c­los). Yet, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is it­self break­ing rules and the US has never rat­i­fied Un­c­los. This breeds scep­ti­cism about in­ter­na­tional law; that it is used not from prin­ci­ple but weaponised to wage what is called “law­fare”.</p>
    <p>If war is ac­cepted as the mas­ter nar­ra­tive, then no sin­gle is­sue is de­ter­mi­nant and im­por­tant in it­self. Whether it is the South China Sea or, say, Hong Kong, ev­ery is­sue is in­stead sub­servient – treated merely as skir­mishes, proxy con­flicts and as op­por­tu­ni­ties for pro­pa­ganda.</p>
    <p>BE­ING BE­TWEEN</p>
    <p>This is not to say that Asean and oth­ers in the re­gion are en­tirely at ease with China. Asians do want a Bei­jing that is less as­sertive and more of a part­ner. But the same is true of what they would like from the US.</p>
    <p>Re­fus­ing the frame­work of war does not mean coun­tries in be­tween are blind to the in­creas­ing ri­valry. But there is good rea­son to see the cur­rent ten­sions in a longer arc of events, trac­ing back to the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Back in 2010, I warned in my book, Asia Alone, against a “dan­ger­ous di­vide” be­tween the US and Asia.</p>
    <p>This was be­fore US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was elected but the sen­ti­ment that has since brought him to of­fice was swelling. In China, this was be­fore Mr Xi Jin­ping be­came pres­i­dent, yet a ris­ing as­sertive­ness could be sensed.</p>
    <p>My book also in­cluded a map of South China Sea dis­putes. But at that time, there were nei­ther ex­ten­sive recla­ma­tion by China nor Amer­i­can “free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion” naval pa­trols. The prob­lem was be­ing man­aged and calmed by diplo­macy, and it is not im­pos­si­ble that it can be again.</p>
    <p>Some do ac­cuse then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama of hav­ing been too soft on China. But to swing to the other ex­treme of bel­li­cos­ity is not the so­lu­tion. Nor is Mr Trump’s in­con­sis­tency. The US to­day snubs the re­gion’s sum­mits and broader agenda, and only seems to call when it is Wash­ing­ton that wants some­thing. Con­se­quently, “Amer­ica first” of­ten re­sults in “Amer­ica only”.</p>
    <p>The need is, in­stead, to build con­sis­tent and stead­fast en­gage­ment with other coun­tries, tak­ing a mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proach across a broad range of is­sues. The US used to be able and will­ing to build such part­ner­ships. But to­day, such com­pre­hen­sive en­gage­ments and col­lec­tive ef­forts are left to other coun­tries and strug­gle with­out the co­op­er­a­tion of great pow­ers.</p>
    <p>More­over, such ef­forts must ac­com­mo­date the le­git­i­mate ex­pec­ta­tions of China, to­day and for the fu­ture, rather than be geared solely to­wards push­ing back on the South China Sea and the widest range of Bei­jing’s in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>The in­creas­ing Sino-Amer­i­can an­tag­o­nism con­cern­ing the econ­omy, fi­nance and tech­nol­ogy can and should be man­aged. But this should be sub­ject to es­tab­lished in­ter­na­tional rules, or by de­vel­op­ing new norms, and not sim­ply be shaped ac­cord­ing to what is best for the US.</p>
    <p>In this con­text, it is far bet­ter to frame is­sues and ac­tions as one of strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion rather than “war”. We might pause to think what vic­tory could mean in a deeply in­ter­de­pen­dent world al­ready strug­gling with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>If wag­ing “war” hob­bles China’s re­turn to growth, or dis­tracts Amer­i­cans from their own do­mes­tic chal­lenges, great harm re­sults – not only on the two coun­tries di­rectly, but also on all oth­ers, and the over­all in­ter­na­tional sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Long ago, the Prus­sian Gen­eral Clause­witz spoke of war be­ing “pol­icy by other means”. In­ter­na­tional law and global in­ter­de­pen­dence have strength­ened since to limit the use of force and rule out co­er­cion. Yet, a kind of re­ver­sal is now risked.</p>
    <p>Even short of mil­i­tary col­li­sion, stri­dent pol­i­tics and provoca­tive poli­cies are emerg­ing that add up to “war by other means” – waged through eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial sanc­tions, co­er­cion and one-sided “law­fare”.</p>
    <p>The coun­tries in be­tween should not ac­cept this mind­set. It is not easy be­ing caught be­tween China and the US. But if their com­pe­ti­tion and ri­valry are re­clas­si­fied as “war” and seen through the lens of in­evitable con­flict, the sit­u­a­tion will be­come next to im­pos­si­ble.</p>
