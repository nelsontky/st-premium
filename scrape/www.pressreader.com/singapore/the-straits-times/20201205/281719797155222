    <p>NASHVILLE • In 1992, when Tina Gib­son was nearly two years old, a cou­ple do­nated em­bryos which were then frozen in a clinic in the Mid­west.</p>
    <p>In February this year, one of those em­bryos was im­planted in Ms Gib­son, now a teacher i n Knoxville, Ten­nessee. In Oc­to­ber, she gave birth to a 3.09kg baby whom Ms Gib­son and her hus­band, Ben, named Molly.</p>
    <p>The birth broke the record for the long­est-frozen em­bryo to re­sult in a live birth.</p>
    <p>That record, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Em­bryo Do­na­tion Cen­tre in Ten­nessee, was set in 2017, when Molly’s older sis­ter, Emma, was born af­ter an em­bryo from the same donor cou­ple was im­planted in Ms Gib­son.</p>
    <p>“We feel so blessed that God so long ago de­cided this was go­ing to be our fam­ily,” Ms Gib­son said. “I can’t imag­ine hav­ing any other kids but these kids. They’re just meant to be ours.”</p>
    <p>Molly’s birth is the re­sult of a process that be­gan when an em­bryo was frozen on Oct 14, 1992. It was thawed in February this year, said Ms Martha Earl, di­rec­tor of the Univer­sity of Ten­nessee Pre­ston Med­i­cal Li­brary.</p>
    <p>She said she had re­searched med­i­cal journal ar­ti­cles and had “found no pub­lished case in a med­i­cal journal of a live birth” of an em­bryo that had been frozen for more than 20 years.</p>
    <p>Molly’s birth shows that there is not a lim­ited length of time an em­bryo can be frozen, even though freez­ing tech­niques have changed sig­nif­i­cantly since the 1990s, said Dr Jef­frey Keenan, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Em­bryo Do­na­tion Cen­tre, a Chris­tian or­gan­i­sa­tion that per­formed the trans­fers.</p>
    <p>“If the em­bryo sur­vives the thaw well, it should have just as good a chance as a freshly cre­ated em­bryo,” he said.</p>
    <p>“No em­bryo is too old.”</p>
    <p>The birth is an ex­cit­ing de­vel­op­ment that will al­low fer­til­ity doc­tors to re­as­sure prospec­tive par­ents that an em­bryo frozen for years, even decades, will re­main vi</p>
    <p>able, said Dr Mindy Chris­tian­son, med­i­cal di­rec­tor at the Johns Hop­kins Fer­til­ity Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Pa­tients of­ten ask how long can em­bryos be frozen,” she said. “Of­ten, the an­swer is, ‘We don’t re­ally know.’ Now we can say with con­fi­dence there have been ba­bies born from em­bryos that have been frozen for 27 years.”</p>
    <p>Dr Si­gal Klip­stein, di­rec­tor of the egg donor pro­gramme at InVia Fer­til­ity Spe­cial­ists in Chicago, said that the length of time an em­bryo spends frozen is not an im­por­tant data point for fer­til­ity doc­tors.</p>
    <p>“The is­sue is the qual­ity of the em­bryo at the time of freez­ing,” she said. “If it’s a good qual­ity em­bryo, we an­tic­i­pate that it will re­main a good qual­ity em­bryo at the tim­ing of the freez­ing and at the tim­ing of the thaw.”</p>
    <p>Ms Gib­son said she and her hus­band had de­cided to use do­nated em­bryos af­ter see­ing a news story about a woman who had tried to get preg­nant the same way.</p>
    <p>The Gib­sons had strug­gled for five years to adopt a child, but the process was rid­dled with set­backs.</p>
    <p>They were hes­i­tant to pur­sue in vitro fer­til­i­sa­tion be­cause Ben, 36, has cys­tic fi­bro­sis, and his wife, 29, learnt she was a car­rier. Ms Gib­son said they feared pass­ing the con­di­tion on to their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>When they be­gan re­search­ing donor em­bryos at the do­na­tion cen­tre, they learnt about the donor par­ents’ ages, phys­i­cal char­ac­ter­is­tics, ed­u­ca­tional and med­i­cal back­grounds and even hob­bies. The ages of the em­bryos were not listed.</p>
    <p>Ms Gib­son said she had been ner­vous about that at first but had felt bet­ter af­ter Dr Keenan told her it would make no dif­fer­ence to the ba­bies’ health. “Both preg­nan­cies went smoothly,” she said. “Both are per­fectly healthy.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Molly was born in Oc&#xAD;to&#xAD;ber from an em&#xAD;bryo which was frozen in 1992. The birth is an ex&#xAD;cit&#xAD;ing de&#xAD;vel&#xAD;op&#xAD;ment for fer&#xAD;til&#xAD;ity doc&#xAD;tors as it shows an em&#xAD;bryo frozen for decades can still re&#xAD;main vi&#xAD;able.</p>
