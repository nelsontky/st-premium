    <p>Collins Dic­tionary has se­lected “lock­down” as the Word of the Year in 2020 be­cause it has be­come syn­ony­mous with the ex­pe­ri­ence of pop­u­la­tions across the world. Other new words that made it to the on­line edi­tion of the English dic­tionary in­clude “BLM”, “Tik­Toker” and “Muk­bang”.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Collins Dic­tionary yes­ter­day said that “lock­down” is its word of the year, fol­low­ing a dra­matic in­crease in its us­age dur­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Lex­i­cog­ra­phers said they picked the word be­cause it had be­come syn­ony­mous with the ex­pe­ri­ence of pop­u­la­tions across the world as govern­ments look to curb the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It is a uni­fy­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for bil­lions of peo­ple across the world, who have had to play their part col­lec­tively in com­bat­ing the spread of Covid-19,” pub­lish­ers Harper Collins said.</p>
    <p>Collins reg­is­tered more than a quar­ter of a mil­lion us­ages of “lock­down” dur­ing this year, against only 4,000 the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the way the pan­demic has af­fected the daily use of lan­guage, six of the dic­tionary’s 10 words of the year this year are re­lated to the global health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Coro­n­avirus”, “so­cial dis­tanc­ing”, “self-iso­late” and “fur­lough”, as well as “lock­down” and “key worker”, were in­cluded in the longer list of 10 words of the year.</p>
    <p>“Key worker” alone has seen a six­ty­fold rise in us­age, re­flect­ing the im­por­tance at­trib­uted this year to pro­fes­sions con­sid­ered to be essen­tial to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“2020 has been dom­i­nated by the global pan­demic,” said Ms He­len New­stead, a lan­guage con­sul­tant at Collins.</p>
    <p>“Lock­down has af­fected the way we work, study, shop and so­cialise.</p>
    <p>“With many coun­tries en­ter­ing a sec­ond lock­down, it is not a word of the year to cel­e­brate but it is, per­haps, one that sums up the year for most of the world.”</p>
    <p>Collins de­fines “lock­down” as “the im­po­si­tion of strin­gent re­stric­tions on travel, so­cial in­ter­ac­tion, and ac­cess to pub­lic spa­ces”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the dic­tionary, coro­n­avirus is: “Any one of a group of RNA-con­tain­ing viruses that can cause in­fec­tious ill­nesses of the res­pi­ra­tory tract, in­clud­ing Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant so­cial and po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments be­yond the virus have also been re­flected in the list, which has al­ready made its way into on­line edi­tions of the English dic­tionary.</p>
    <p>A wave of Black Lives Mat­ter protests, sparked by the death in US po­lice cus­tody of un­armed black man Ge­orge Floyd, spread around the world and brought a new aware­ness of the move­ment.</p>
    <p>The ab­bre­vi­a­tion “BLM”, of­ten used as a hash­tag on so­cial me­dia, was widely used in con­ver­sa­tions and re­port­ing fol­low­ing the protests, reg­is­ter­ing an in­crease in us­age of 581 per cent by Collins.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia reg­u­larly throws up new words for the dic­tionary.</p>
    <p>This year, Collins has in­cluded “Tik­Toker”, which de­scribes some­one who shares con­tent on the Tik­Tok so­cial me­dia plat­form.</p>
    <p>“Muk­bang”, which refers to a South Korean trend of video blog­gers eat­ing large quan­ti­ties of food in videos broad­cast to their fol­low­ers, has also made the list.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish royal fam­ily also in­flu­enced the short­list this year.</p>
    <p>“Megxit”, which refers to the with­drawal of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan from royal du­ties, passed into reg­u­lar us­age.</p>
    <p>The word, mod­elled on “Brexit”, which was Collins’ word of the year in 2016, il­lus­trates just how firmly es­tab­lished that word now is in the Bri­tish lex­i­con.</p>
