    <p>FIC­TION A MAN</p>
    <p>By Kei­ichiro Hi­rano, trans­lated by Eli K. P. Wil­liam Ama­zon Cross­ing/Pa­per­back/</p>
    <p>287 pages/$22.42/</p>
    <p>Avail­able at http://bit.ly/AMan_KH</p>
    <p>Can a man have his i den­tity stripped away so en­tirely that he is re­duced to his gen­der, as per the non­de­script ti­tle of this novel?</p>
    <p>Kei­ichiro Hi­rano takes on such weighty is­sues as ex­is­ten­tial iden­tity crises, and the lengths one might go to ex­or­cise demons of the past in A Man, which was awarded the pres­ti­gious Yomi­uri Prize for Lit­er­a­ture last year.</p>
    <p>This is also Hi­rano’s first book to be trans­lated into English. Cana­dian writer Eli K. P. Wil­liam, who has lived in Ja­pan for more than a decade, deftly cap­tures the sub­tle emo­tional nu­ances char­ac­ter­is­tic of the Ja­panese lan­guage.</p>
    <p>The tit­u­lar man is Daisuke Taniguchi, an unas­sum­ing but like­able man who turns up sud­denly in Town S, a forestry vil­lage i n Miyazaki pre­fec­ture i n Kyushu, find­ing work as a lum­ber­jack.</p>
    <p>He meets and falls in love with lo­cal sta­tionery shop owner Rie Take­moto, who is di­vorced af­ter the death of one of her two sons. They later get mar­ried.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily is pic­ture per­fect, until Daisuke dies in a log­ging ac­ci­dent sev­eral years later.</p>
    <p>Rie dis­cov­ers that he is, in fact, not who he says he is.</p>
    <p>Then who ex­actly is this man, who has not only adopted the name Daisuke Taniguchi, but also as­sumed the finer de­tails of his life?</p>
    <p>The im­me­di­ate con­clu­sion – one which she des­per­ately does not want to be­lieve – is that her late hus­band must have been a crim­i­nal on the lam.</p>
    <p>She seeks out at­tor­ney Akira Kido, who rep­re­sented her in her di­vorce pro­ceed­ings, and they en­ter the murky world of back­room trad­ing in “fam­ily reg­is­ters”, which are es­sen­tially iden­tity pa­pers, for people who want to get rid of their past.</p>
    <p>The novel is set just af­ter the March 11, 2011, earth­quake, tsunami and nu­clear dis­as­ter hit north­east­ern Ja­pan. Kido does pro bono work to as­sist Fukushima sur­vivors who had to evac­u­ate in the wake of the nu­clear fall­out.</p>
    <p>But his wife re­sents him for spend­ing so much time away from her and their young son and their mar­riage is on the verge of fall­ing apart.</p>
    <p>The Fukushima tragedy has – in real life and fic­tion – trig­gered dis­crim­i­na­tion aris­ing from an us-ver­sus-them mind­set.</p>
    <p>As a third-gen­er­a­tion Zainichi (eth­nic Korean in Ja­pan), Kido finds him­self won­der­ing how to rec­on­cile his an­ces­try with his iden­tity as a nat­u­ralised Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>It is here that the two threads of the story dove­tail, with Kido quoted as say­ing: “It’s un­bear­able to have your iden­tity summed up by one thing and one thing only and for other people to have con­trol over what that is.”</p>
    <p>A Man, which also dis­cusses Ja­pan’s death penalty and di­vorce laws, can be rather over melo­dra­matic.</p>
    <p>Hi­rano could also have found more novel ways to get Kido closer to solv­ing the mys­tery, rather than re­ly­ing on co­in­ci­den­tal lucky breaks.</p>
    <p>But, as a so­cial com­men­tary, A Man is an in­sight­ful primer for readers in­ter­ested in know­ing more about Ja­panese cul­ture and so­cial is­sues.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Pachinko by Min Jin Lee (Head of Zeus, 2017, $19.62, avail­able at http://bit.ly/Pachinko_MJLee). Pachinko de­tails the strug­gles and dis­crim­i­na­tion faced by the Zainichi eth­nic Korean com­mu­nity in Ja­pan, in a multi­gen­er­a­tional story of re­silience told through the eyes of an im­mi­grant Korean fam­ily.</p>
