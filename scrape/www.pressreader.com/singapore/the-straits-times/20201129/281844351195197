    <p>Ja­pan’s Cabi­net is set to ap­prove as early as next month plans to build two new Aegise­quipped ships as mis­sile in­ter­cep­tors after scut­tling a pro­posal to place the de­fence sys­tem ashore, Kyodo News re­ported.</p>
    <p>If the plan is ap­proved as early as mid-De­cem­ber, spend­ing can be set aside for the sea-based mis­sile in­ter­cep­tor plat­form in the fis­cal 2021 bud­get to be drafted by yearend, Kyodo said yes­ter­day, cit­ing govern­ment sources it did not iden­tify. The es­ti­mated cost for the Aegis-equipped de­stroy­ers would be more than US$5 bil­lion (S$6.7 bil­lion), it re­ported.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan sees the bat­ter­ies as one level of pro­tec­tion from the grow­ing mis­sile threats of China and North Korea – with the lat­ter hav­ing test-fired rock­ets over Ja­panese ter­ri­tory. In June, then De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono an­nounced that the de­ploy­ment of Lock­heed Martin’s Aegis Ashore mis­sile de­fence sys­tem, with an es­ti­mated price tag of US$5 bil­lion would be can­celled due to cost and safety con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Mr Kono’s re­place­ment, Mr Nobuo Kishi, said last month the govern­ment was con­sid­er­ing a plan to in­stall the com­po­nents of the sys­tem on a mo­bile plat­form at sea. He also dis­cussed op­tions for the mis­sile in­ter­cep­tor sys­tem that month with then US Sec­re­tary of De­fence Mark Esper.</p>
    <p>There were plans ear­lier to de­ploy two on­shore bat­ter­ies in the pre­fec­tures of Ya­m­aguchi and Akita, at ei­ther end of Ja­pan’s main is­land of Hon­shu, which drew protests from lo­cal res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Since last year, North Korea has tested short-range bal­lis­tic mis­siles able to de­liver a nu­clear war­head to any­where in South Korea and avoid US in­ter­cep­tors. North Korea launched two mis­siles over Hokkaido to the north in 2017. The coun­try con­sid­ers Ja­pan its mor­tal en­emy and has hun­dreds of mis­siles that po­ten­tially can strike all parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s cur­rent mis­sile-de­fence sys­tem re­lies on up­per-tier in­ter­cep­tion by Aegis-equipped de­stroy­ers and lower-al­ti­tude mis­siles be­ing shot down by Pa­triot PAC-3 in­ter­cep­tors.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party has also pro­posed con­sid­er­ing mis­sile sys­tems that would al­low the coun­try to pre-emp­tively hit en­emy rock­ets be­fore they leave the launch pad, see­ing this as a de­fen­sive move.</p>
