    <p>LON­DON Manch­ester City mid­fielder Phil Fo­den was yes­ter­day re­called to Eng­land’s foot­ball squad for their up­com­ing matches but Manch­ester United for­ward Ma­son Green­wood re­mains in ex­ile af­ter the pair’s coro­n­avirus pro­to­col breach.</p>
    <p>City for­ward Ra­heem Ster­ling was also re­called af­ter miss­ing the Oc­to­ber in­ter­na­tional break due to a mi­nor ham­string in­jury.</p>
    <p>Fo­den and Green­wood were sent home in dis­grace af­ter invit­ing two lo­cal mod­els to their team ho­tel fol­low­ing their in­ter­na­tional de­buts in Septem­ber’s Na­tions League clash against Ice­land in</p>
    <p>Reyk­javik, flout­ing safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Eng­land coach Gareth South­gate left them out of his squad for last month’s matches as pun­ish­ment and branded their be­hav­iour in the midst of the pan­demic as “un­ac­cept­able”.</p>
    <p>But Fo­den has since scored three times in six Pre­mier League games, catch­ing the eye with his im­pres­sive form for City.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old was re­warded with a re­call ahead of next week’s friendly against Ire­land and Na­tions League matches against Bel­gium and Ice­land.</p>
    <p>Green­wood, 19, once again missed out de­spite the ab­sence of in­jured Southamp­ton striker Danny Ings.</p>
    <p>United goal­keeper Dean Hen­der­son is the only un­capped player in the 29-man squad, with Jor­dan Pick­ford se­lected de­spite his in­con­sis­tent form for Ever­ton, which led to Robin Olsen re­plac­ing him in goal last week­end. De­fend­ers Reece James and Harry Maguire were in­cluded even though they were sent off when Eng­land lost 1-0 to Den­mark in their pre­vi­ous match.</p>
    <p>On Fo­den’s re­call and Green­wood’s omis­sion, South­gate said yes­ter­day: “They don’t come as a pair. They’re in­di­vid­ual play­ers with their own strengths and tal­ents... Phil has had quite a lot of foot­ball with his club re­cently and Ma­son has had less game time with United. I’ve had a good chat with (man­ager) Ole (Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer) about his de­vel­op­ment. I feel it’s bet­ter for him to stay with the club at the mo­ment and to de­velop over the next few months.</p>
    <p>“There’s no carry-over with what hap­pened in Septem­ber.”</p>
    <p>European cham­pi­ons Por­tu­gal will wel­come Cris­tiano Ron­aldo back in their squad for a friendly against An­dorra and Na­tions League matches against France and Croa­tia.</p>
    <p>The five-time Ballon d’Or win­ner tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus on Oct 13 when with the Por­tu­gal squad and missed the 3-0 vic­tory over Sweden. He tested neg­a­tive 19 days later, re­turn­ing to the pitch with a dou­ble for Ju­ven­tus against Spezia in Serie A ac­tion last Sun­day.</p>
