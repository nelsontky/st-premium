    <p>If this week marks a turn­ing point in the 2020 pres­i­den­tial race, it may owe as much to events in Wis­con­sin as the vir­tual Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Trail­ing in the polls, in­cum­bent Don­ald Trump was al­ready count­ing on a mes­sage about the threat of civil dis­or­der to help him reach un­de­cided and mod­er­ate vot­ers.</p>
    <p>But events have con­spired to give him an un­ex­pected boost. Last Sun­day’s shoot­ing of Mr Ja­cob Blake, who is black, by po­lice in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, has sparked a wave of protests in this sleepy Mid­west­ern city of fewer than 100,000 res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral nights of un­rest saw build­ings set on fire, fa­tal gun­fire and scuf­fles among pro­test­ers and counter-pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>This may­hem am­pli­fies Mr Trump’s law and or­der mes­sage and poses an un­com­fort­able chal­lenge for Demo­crat Joe Bi­den and his run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris.</p>
    <p>Since the May killing of Mr Ge­orge Floyd by a Min­neapo­lis po­lice of­fi­cer, there have been vi­o­lent protests in at least two dozen large cities, and homi­cides are sharply up in many of them.</p>
    <p>Yet many Demo­cratic may­ors, city coun­cil mem­bers and pro­gres­sive protest move­ments are call­ing for cuts in po­lice depart­ment fund­ing and per­son­nel.</p>
    <p>In New York, Mayor Bill DeBla­sio dis­banded the city’s plain-clothes unit that tracked down vi­o­lent crim­i­nals and il­le­gal firearms.</p>
    <p>Shoot­ings soared in the weeks af­ter the dis­band­ing and Mr Trump called Mr DeBla­sio a “com­mu­nist” who “got rid of some of the most tal­ented po­lice­men... Look at the shoot­ings”.</p>
    <p>Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Po­lice Or­gan­i­sa­tions pres­i­dent Michael McHale fol­lowed up at this week’s con­ven­tion with: “Chaos re­sults when failed of­fi­cials... make the con­scious de­ci­sion not to sup­port law enforcemen­t.”</p>
    <p>In a new Pew poll, 59 per cent of vot­ers said vi­o­lent crime was “very im­por­tant” to how they will vote, mak­ing it a top five is­sue. It wasn’t in the top 10 in 2016.</p>
    <p>And a re­cent sur­vey in</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin, a swing state, found that sup­port for Black Lives Mat­ter has de­clined over the sum­mer while there is ris­ing con­cern about vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, na­tional gun pur­chases are surg­ing. The Fed­eral Bu­reau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion con­ducted a record 3.9 mil­lion back­ground checks for firearms pur­chases in June. A year ear­lier, there were just 2.3 mil­lion. Some 40 per cent of this year’s firearms pur­chasers were first-time buy­ers.</p>
    <p>A gun store owner in the swing state of Michi­gan re­cently told a lo­cal news­pa­per that new cus­tomers “are con­cerned be­cause of the ri­ots, up­heaval, protests and talk of de­fund­ing the po­lice”.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can con­ven­tion speak­ers have sought to tap into th­ese con­cerns by ar­gu­ing that Mr Bi­den and Ms Har­ris should have spo­ken out more force­fully against civil un­rest and in sup­port of the po­lice.</p>
    <p>They have also crit­i­cised the Democrats for propos­ing new re­stric­tions in firearms pur­chases, in­clud­ing a Bi­den pro­posal to ban a range of guns.</p>
    <p>Democrats have learnt from bit­ter ex­pe­ri­ence that gun rights and law and or­der is­sues can be used against them.</p>
    <p>In 1994, for­mer pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton blamed the party’s big losses in the midterm elec­tions on gun rights ac­tivists. They were so an­gry about a new law ban­ning as­sault weapons that they turned out in high numbers to vote Repub­li­can.</p>
    <p>In 1968, Repub­li­can Richard Nixon made po­lit­i­cal hay of civil un­rest, in­clud­ing vi­o­lent con­fronta­tions be­tween po­lice and pro­test­ers at the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion in Chicago, by run­ning on an agenda of restor­ing “law and or­der”.</p>
    <p>He won de­ci­sively in the elec­toral col­lege, while nar­rowly win­ning the pop­u­lar vote, af­ter nar­rat­ing a tele­vi­sion ad­ver­tise­ment – set against images of ur­ban vi­o­lence – in which he de­clared: “So I pledge to you, we shall have or­der in the United States.”</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence sounded sim­i­lar this week: “Let me be clear... We will have law and or­der on the streets of Amer­ica.”</p>
    <p>The gun and law enforcemen­t is­sues could well un­der­mine a key part of what was sup­posed to be Mr Bi­den’s strength: his abil­ity to win back work­ing-class vot­ers who sup­ported Mr Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but de­fected to Mr Trump four years ago.</p>
    <p>Work­ing-class whites are also the largest group of Amer­i­cans who sat out re­cent elec­tions. A Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion study sug­gests that if a small num­ber of them turn out and back Mr Trump, it would give him a boost in bat­tle­ground states.</p>
    <p>Polls also show that sub­ur­ban swing vot­ers – who helped Democrats win back con­trol of the House in 2018 – are con­cerned about the vi­o­lent protests.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump tapped into their con­cerns when he pre­vailed four years ago. Events of the past week sug­gest he may be able to do so again.</p>
