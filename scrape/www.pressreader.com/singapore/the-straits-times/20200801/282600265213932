    <p>I have some pot­ted snake plants I keep in­doors. Lately, the leaves of two of the plants be­came curved and lumpy. I al­ways use a small wa­ter spray and sun the plants twice weekly. What is wrong with the plants? Ricky Choo</p>
    <p>The leaves of your snake plants (San­se­vieria cul­ti­var) seem to have some wrin­kle lines. To­gether with the curl­ing of the leaf mar­gins, these signs sug­gest your plants may be lack­ing wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Al­though the snake plant is of­ten re­garded as a drought-tol­er­ant plant, it will be detri­men­tal to its health if it has been al­lowed to dry out for a pro­longed pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>Af­ter each wa­ter­ing, ex­cess wa­ter should come out from the drainage holes at the base of the pot – this is an in­di­ca­tion your plant has been thor­oughly wa­tered. Al­low the soil to dry out slightly be­fore wa­ter­ing again.</p>
    <p>The slight elon­ga­tion of the new leaves may also point to the lack of light. De­pend­ing on the cul­ti­var, some snake plants do bet­ter with sev­eral hours of di­rect sun­light. With suf­fi­cient sun­light, your plants will re­tain the at­trac­tive, com­pact growth habit ex­pected of the cul­ti­var.</p>
