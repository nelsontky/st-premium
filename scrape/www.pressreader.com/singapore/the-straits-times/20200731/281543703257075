    <p>Or­gan­is­ers of the Suzuki Cup, orig­i­nally sched­uled for Nov 23 to Dec 31, have been forced to post­pone to next year the Asean Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion tour­na­ment, as Covid-19 is still spread­ing across South-east Asia, and with the safety of all stake­hold­ers be­ing the top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>ZURICH • Crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings have been opened against Fifa pres­i­dent Gianni In­fantino by a spe­cial pros­e­cu­tor look­ing into deal­ings be­tween the head of the global foot­ball body and Swiss At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Michael Lauber, Swiss au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A spe­cial pros­e­cu­tor ap­pointed last month to re­view com­plaints against the two men and oth­ers had found in­di­ca­tions of crim­i­nal con­duct re­lated to their meet­ings, ac­cord­ing to the watch­dog over­see­ing the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>“This con­cerns abuse of pub­lic of­fice, breach of of­fi­cial se­crecy, as­sist­ing of­fend­ers and in­cite­ment to these acts,” the AB-BA watch­dog said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>In­fantino, 50, and Lauber, 54, are said to have held a se­ries of se­cret meet­ings in 2016 and 2017. Both of them have de­nied wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Fifa did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>It said last week in a state­ment that the meet­ings were le­git­i­mate and le­gal.</p>
    <p>In­fantino was elected in 2016 to re­place dis­graced Sepp Blat­ter, who was also the sub­ject of crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings in 2015.</p>
    <p>Yet the Swiss-Ital­ian l awyer could be the sec­ond Fifa pres­i­dent to be banned from the sport after</p>
    <p>Blat­ter, who is cur­rently serv­ing a six-year ban from all foot­ball-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tions against Swiss Blat­ter, who is sus­pected of crim­i­nal mis­man­age­ment, are still on­go­ing and he has not been charged. He de­nies wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>On be­ing elected, In­fantino promised to clean up Fifa and to put the fo­cus back on foot­ball.</p>
    <p>Fifa was em­broiled in the worst cor­rup­tion scan­dal in its his­tory in 2015 which led to sev­eral of­fi­cials be­ing charged in the United States with re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>Lauber was in charge of Switzer­land’s probe into the scan­dal that erupted when Swiss po­lice in May that year raided a lux­ury ho­tel in Zurich be­fore dawn.</p>
    <p>Lauber last week of­fered to re­sign after a court con­cluded he had cov­ered up a meet­ing with In­fantino and lied to su­per­vi­sors while his of­fice in­ves­ti­gated cor­rup­tion sur­round­ing foot­ball’s gov­ern­ing body. A fed­eral court also said he had com­mit­ted sev­eral breaches of his of­fi­cial du­ties.</p>
    <p>Lauber of­fi­cially ten­dered his res­ig­na­tion on Tues­day, his of­fice said, with his last day of ac­tive duty set for Aug 31.</p>
    <p>The AB-BA watch­dog said spe­cial pros­e­cu­tor Ste­fan Keller had now opened pro­ceed­ings against both In­fantino and a re­gional pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor who was in­volved in the meet­ings, and was seek­ing par­lia­men­tary ap­proval to have Lauber’s im­mu­nity from pros­e­cu­tion waived.</p>
