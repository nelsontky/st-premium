    <p>This year’s Asean Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion (AFF) Suzuki Cup, orig­i­nally sched­uled for Nov 23 to Dec 31, has been post­poned to next year due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 still spread­ing across South-east Asia, and safety of all stake­hold­ers be­ing the top pri­or­ity, the move was dis­cussed at vir­tual AFF task force com­mit­tee meet­ings on Mon­day and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>AFF pres­i­dent Ma­jor-Gen­eral Khiev Sameth of Cam­bo­dia said in a state­ment yes­ter­day: “Since the on­set of Covid-19, the AFF has been closely mon­i­tor­ing guid­ance from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, health min­istries, govern­ment agen­cies, Fifa and AFC.</p>
    <p>“With the risk of the spread of Covid-19 re­main­ing high, the AFF finds it­self in a sit­u­a­tion where we can­not pro­ceed safely with the AFF Suzuki Cup 2020.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore captain Hariss Harun, 29, told The Straits Times he un­der­stood the de­ci­sion was made with the big­ger pic­ture in mind.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder added: “While the</p>
    <p>Suzuki Cup is a tour­na­ment we look for­ward to, health and safety must come first and in such un­cer­tain times, I trust the au­thor­i­ties to make a de­ci­sion based on that.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore are the sec­ond most suc­cess­ful team in the com­pe­ti­tion’s his­tory with four ti­tles, one be­hind Thai­land.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Lions have not made it past the group stage into the two-legged semi-fi­nals in the three edi­tions since they last won the tour­na­ment in 2012.</p>
    <p>Na­tional head coach Tatsuma Yoshida said: “We fully un­der­stand and sup­port that this de­ci­sion was made in the best in­ter­ests of the Asean foot­ball com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“This is a time for us to put our on­pitch ri­val­ries on hold and work to­gether to over­come the com­mon ad­ver­sary in Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Along­side the 2022 World Cup Qual­i­fiers, the AFF Suzuki Cup was among our top pri­or­i­ties this year given its sig­nif­i­cance as the top foot­ball tour­na­ment in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“How­ever with this post­pone­ment, it will al­low us more time to pre­pare for the com­pe­ti­tion and we are look­ing for­ward to putting on a good show­ing for our fans when the tour­na­ment com­mences in 2021.”</p>
    <p>For the de­layed tour­na­ment, ST un­der­stands that the AFF prefers to re­tain its cur­rent for­mat where teams play home and away games from the group stage to the fi­nal as this at­tracts more fans to sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>But it is also con­sid­er­ing a re­turn to an older for­mat with just one host coun­try to al­low for eas­ier lo­gis­tics amid travel re­stric­tions and quar­an­tine orders.</p>
    <p>Adrian Staiti, Asia-Pa­cific pres­i­dent at Sport­five, the Suzuki Cup’s ex­clu­sive com­mer­cial part­ner, said it “will work closely with the AFF to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion and look for­ward to work­ing with our part­ners to de­liver a great tour­na­ment for the fans of Asean next year”.</p>
    <p>Last Sun­day, de­fend­ing Suzuki Cup cham­pi­ons Viet­nam sus­pended its do­mes­tic foot­ball leagues fol­low­ing news of the first lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases of coro­n­avirus in more than three months.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam was the first in the re­gion to re­sume top-level com­pet­i­tive foot­ball when the Viet­namese Na­tional Cup kicked off on May 23 with fans in at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>World Cup qual­i­fiers for the Asian con­fed­er­a­tion sched­uled for March and June had also been post­poned, while many other high-pro­file sport­ing events in Asia were axed due to the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>These in­clude For­mula One races in China, Viet­nam, Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore, the Asean Basketball League played across coun­tries like Thai­land, Malaysia and the Philip­pines and a host of in­ter­na­tional golf, ten­nis and bad­minton tour­na­ments in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>SIL­VER LIN­ING</p>
    <p>This post­pone­ment will al­low us more time to pre­pare... We look for­ward to putting on a good show­ing for our fans in 2021.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>TATSUMA YOSHIDA, Lions head coach plans to use the ex­tra time wisely.</p>
