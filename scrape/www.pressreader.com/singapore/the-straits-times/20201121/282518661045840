    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Tiger Woods and his son Char­lie will be hunt­ing a ti­tle when they team up next month at the PNC Cham­pi­onship, a joint PGA/LPGA Tour fam­ily tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>For­merly known as the Fa­ther/ Son Chal­lenge, the PNC Cham­pi­onship will be played at the RitzCarl­ton Golf Club in Or­lando from Dec 17 to 20 and fea­ture Ma­jor win­ners and fam­ily mem­bers as com­pet­ing teams.</p>
    <p>It marks the first time Woods, win­ner of 15 Ma­jors, and his 11-year-old son will play the tour­na­ment that was won last year by Ger­many’s Bern­hard Langer and son Ja­son.</p>
    <p>“I can’t tell you how ex­cited I am to be play­ing with Char­lie in our first of­fi­cial tour­na­ment to­gether,” Woods, 44, said in a state­ment on the PGA Tour web­site.</p>
    <p>“It’s been great watch­ing him progress as a ju­nior golfer and it will be in­cred­i­ble play­ing as a team to­gether i n the PNC Cham­pi­onship.”</p>
    <p>Char­lie has shown signs that he has some of his fa­ther’s golf­ing genes by win­ning his age group at a nine-hole US Kids Golf event in Au­gust by five shots.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Guardian, Woods has cad­died for his son in sev­eral ju­nior tour­na­ments and the boy’s smooth swing went vi­ral ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Woods was fa­mously in­tro­duced to the sport by his fa­ther Earl, ap­pear­ing on the Mike Dou</p>
    <p>HE CAN GO FAR</p>
    <p>glas Show at just two years old, giv­ing the tele­vi­sion au­di­ence a glimpse of the raw tal­ent that has car­ried him to 82 Tour wins.</p>
    <p>“He’s start­ing to get into it,” Woods told GolfTV ear­lier this year about Char­lie.</p>
    <p>“He’s start­ing to un­der­stand how to play. It’s been just an ab­so­lute blast to go out there and just be with him. It re­minds me so much of me and my dad.”</p>
    <p>Does Char­lie have the be­gin­nings of tal­ent that saw his fa­ther win three US Ju­nior Am­a­teurs and three US Am­a­teurs? Can he push to­wards the same great­ness his fa­ther has achieved? It is way too early to tell, and un­fair to place such ex­pec­ta­tions on him.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know. It de­pends how bad he wants it. It’s all on him,”</p>
    <p>Woods said when asked. “I wanted it at a very, very early age. I wanted to com­pete and play in this game. That’s on him – whether he wants it or not.”</p>
    <p>Woods has largely kept his chil­dren, Char­lie and 13-year-old daugh­ter Sam, out of the pub­lic eye, although both were on hand when he won the Mas­ters last year for his first Ma­jor ti­tle in more than a decade.</p>
    <p>He and their mother Elin Norde­gren were di­vorced 10 years ago fol­low­ing his widely pub­li­cised sex scan­dal.</p>
    <p>He fin­ished the coro­n­avirus pan­demic-de­layed Mas­ters this month in de­flat­ing style, with a fi­nal-round 76 that in­cluded a 10 on the par-three 12th – fol­lowed by five birdies in his last six holes.</p>
    <p>Team­ing up with Char­lie in the PNC Cham­pi­onship gives him one more chance to com­pete in a year that has seen his un­of­fi­cial World Chal­lenge in the Ba­hamas can­celled be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>No fans will be al­lowed at the Florida tour­na­ment but it will be tele­vised in the United States by NBC.</p>
    <p>The Langers will re­turn to de­fend their ti­tle. Amer­i­can Justin Thomas, an­other for­mer world No. 1, will make his de­but along­side his fa­ther, Mike. LPGA great An­nika Soren­stam of Swe­den will also play with her dad.</p>
    <p>Other Ma­jor cham­pi­ons who will tee it up in­clude Greg Nor­man, Vi­jay Singh, Retief Goosen and John Daly.</p>
    <p>He’s start­ing to get into it. He’s start­ing to un­der­stand how to play. It’s been just an ab­so­lute blast to go out there and just be with him. It re­minds me so much of me and my dad.</p>
