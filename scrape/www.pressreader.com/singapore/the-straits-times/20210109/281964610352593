    <p>Q How safe are Covid-19 vac­cines?</p>
    <p>A Mul­ti­ple steps are be­ing taken to en­sure any Covid-19 vac­cine ap­proved for use in Sin­ga­pore is safe.</p>
    <p>First, the data must point to safety in an­i­mal stud­ies be­fore the vac­cine is al­lowed to be tested on hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Even when clin­i­cal tri­als be­gin, there are nu­mer­ous phases in­volved.</p>
    <p>The first two phases of clin­i­cal tri­als, known as early-phase tri­als, are car­ried out mainly among smaller groups of up to hun­dreds of vol­un­teers to test the safety and ef­fi­cacy of a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In these stages, re­searchers look out for dan­ger­ous side ef­fects and an­a­lyse pa­tient sam­ples to see how the hu­man im­mune sys­tem is re­spond­ing to the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Phase 3 tri­als are much larger, usu­ally in­volv­ing thou­sands to tens of thou­sands of peo­ple. These are of­ten held across mul­ti­ple ju­ris­dic­tions or coun­tries.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Phase 3 trial of the Covid-19 vac­cine by Pfiz­erBioNTech – the only vac­cine ap­proved for use in Sin­ga­pore – in­volved more than 43,000 peo­ple. An­other lead­ing Covid-19 vac­cine front run­ner, de­vel­oped by Moderna, had a Phase 3 trial in­volv­ing more than 30,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Once late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als have con­cluded, the data will be re­viewed again by the Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity (HSA) be­fore a vac­cine is ap­proved for use in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This means all vac­cine can­di­dates un­dergo a multi-step “screen­ing” process, and must pass safety checks at each stage be­fore pro­ceed­ing to the next.</p>
    <p>Q But if safety checks are ro­bust, how could a Covid-19 vac­cine be de­vel­oped in such a record time, con­sid­er­ing that it usu­ally takes about a decade for a vac­cine to be rolled out?</p>
    <p>A There are a num­ber of rea­sons for the record pace at which Covid-19 vac­cines were de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>One was fund­ing. Dur­ing the pan­demic, more funds were ploughed into vac­cine devel­op­ment, ac­cel­er­at­ing the pace of re­search.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Time mag­a­zine re­ported last month that the United States alone put US$12.4 bil­lion (S$16.4 bil­lion) into vac­cine devel­op­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing un­der its Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>A 2018 pa­per pub­lished in med­i­cal journal The Lancet noted that de­vel­op­ing a sin­gle epi­demic in­fec­tious dis­ease vac­cine from pre-clin­i­cal tri­als to the end of early-phase tri­als could cost be­tween US$31 mil­lion and US$68 mil­lion, as­sum­ing no risk of fail­ure.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son is that two lead­ing vac­cine can­di­dates, by Pfiz­erBioNTech and Moderna, use new mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA) tech­nol­ogy. This in­volves in­ject­ing just snip­pets of the coro­n­avirus’ ge­netic ma­te­rial – and not the whole virus – into the hu­man body to stim­u­late an im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional vac­cines, on the other hand, use a live or weak­ened virus in­jected into the body to teach it to recog­nise the in­vader.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines that use mRNA tech­nol­ogy do not re­quire ma­nip­u­lat­ing the ac­tual virus, and are safer and quicker to pro­duce.</p>
    <p>As Moderna co-founder Robert Langer, the David H. Koch In­sti­tute Pro­fes­sor at the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, said: “With tra­di­tional vac­cines, you have to do a lot of devel­op­ment. You need a big fac­tory to make the pro­tein, or the virus, and it takes a long time to grow them.</p>
    <p>“The beauty of mRNA is that you don’t need that. If you in­ject na­noen­cap­su­lated mRNA into a per­son, it goes into the cells, and then the body is your fac­tory. The body takes care of ev­ery­thing else from there.”</p>
    <p>Third, reg­u­la­tors like HSA are now also al­low­ing phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies to sub­mit real-time data on a rolling ba­sis, in­stead of only at the end of each phase of the trial.</p>
    <p>Such rolling sub­mis­sions al­low reg­u­la­tors to con­duct a si­mul­ta­ne­ous real-time re­view of the data avail­able to date, in­stead of wait­ing for all the data to be gath­ered be­fore they re­view it.</p>
    <p>This can halve the time it would nor­mally take to have a new vac­cine ap­proved, while en­sur­ing that rel­e­vant safe­guards are in place.</p>
    <p>Q Should I avoid tak­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine if I am afraid of get­ting se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions?</p>
    <p>A As with all es­tab­lished vac­cines and med­i­ca­tions, there is a small risk of very rare but se­ri­ous ad­verse events, in­clud­ing al­ler­gic re­ac­tions, that may oc­cur post-vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Those who re­ceive the Covid-19 vac­cine will be watched for 30 min­utes af­ter the jab so that any se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions such as ana­phy</p>
    <p>QIf safety checks are ro­bust, how could a Covid-19 vac­cine be de­vel­oped in such a record time, con­sid­er­ing that it usu­ally takes about a decade for a vac­cine to be rolled out?</p>
    <p>AThere are a num­ber of rea­sons... One was fund­ing. Dur­ing the pan­demic, more funds were ploughed into vac­cine devel­op­ment, ac­cel­er­at­ing the pace of re­search... An­other rea­son was the newer vac­cine tech­nol­ogy em­ployed. Third, reg­u­la­tors like the Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity are now also al­low­ing phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies to sub­mit real-time data on a rolling ba­sis, in­stead of only at the end of each phase of the trial. laxis can be de­tected and treated promptly.</p>
    <p>A new pro­gramme will also be in­tro­duced to pro­vide sup­port for those who ex­pe­ri­ence se­ri­ous side ef­fects re­lated to Covid-19 vac­cines ad­min­is­tered here.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong told Par­lia­ment that this new pro­gramme by the Health Min­istry will give peace of mind to those re­ceiv­ing the vac­cines, al­though few are ex­pected to need it.</p>
    <p>More de­tails on the vac­cine in­jury fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance pro­gramme will be an­nounced later, he said.</p>
    <p>Q Which groups of peo­ple should wait be­fore re­ceiv­ing the Covid-19 vac­cine?</p>
    <p>A Those with a his­tory of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions should not take the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 vac­cine yet.</p>
    <p>Other groups, such as preg­nant women, im­muno­com­pro­mised in­di­vid­u­als and those un­der the age of 16, should also hold off on re­ceiv­ing the shots, as large-scale clin­i­cal tri­als have not in­volved such vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>This means there is not yet enough data to eval­u­ate the safety of Covid-19 vac­cines for these groups of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Ryan Richard­son, chief strat­egy of­fi­cer and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at BioNTech, told The Straits Times in an in­ter­view this week that stud­ies to de­ter­mine safety and ef­fi­cacy in these sub-groups are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>He said the full data set for the ef­fects of the vac­cine on preg­nant women is still be­ing col­lated.</p>
    <p>But in terms of age groups and eth­nic­ity, the data col­lected so far in­di­cates no se­ri­ous side ef­fects. The com­pany is also closely mon­i­tor­ing the vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigns be­ing rolled out, he said.</p>
    <p>Q There were re­ports that peo­ple died af­ter tak­ing the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine. Is it re­ally safe?</p>
    <p>A There were re­ports that six peo­ple died dur­ing clin­i­cal tri­als of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine.</p>
    <p>But Mr Gan said in Par­lia­ment that only two of the six in­di­vid­u­als were given the vac­cine; the other four had the placebo. In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed no causal re­la­tion­ship be­tween the vac­cine and the two in­di­vid­u­als’ deaths.</p>
    <p>Q Will mRNA vac­cines change my DNA?</p>
    <p>A No, they will not. As an ar­ti­cle in the sci­en­tific journal Na­ture noted last month: “The RNA does not en­ter the nu­cleus where the cell’s genome re­sides, and is de­graded by the cell within a day of the in­jec­tion.”</p>
    <p>The mRNA vac­cines in­volve in­ject­ing snip­pets of the ge­netic ma­te­rial of the coro­n­avirus into the hu­man body. Af­ter in­jec­tion, hu­man cells “read” this mRNA se­quence to build vi­ral spike pro­teins – which en­able the virus to in­fect hu­man cells. This trains the body to recog­nise a key part of the virus – the spike pro­tein – with­out ex­pos­ing it to the whole virus.</p>
    <p>The body will then be­gin to man­u­fac­ture “sol­diers” such as an­ti­bod­ies and killer T-cells to get rid of the for­eign in­vader.</p>
