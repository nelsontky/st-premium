    <p>Now re­named Sen­tosa, Pu­lau Blakang Mati – mean­ing “is­land of death at the rear” in Malay – is ru­moured to have been a killing field dur­ing World War II, where Ja­panese sol­diers be­headed pris­on­ers of war and placed their heads on spikes.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Li­brary Board’s elec­tronic en­cy­clopae­dia, Sin­ga­pore In­fo­pe­dia, the name Pu­lau Blakang Mati could also have ref­er­enced the early piracy and blood­shed in the area.</p>
    <p>Ser­apong Golf Course was pre­vi­ously a beach, where about 300 corpses were washed ashore dur­ing the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion, ac­cord­ing to early news­pa­per re­ports.</p>
    <p>These were re­ported to be Chi­nese civil­ians hurled into the sea by Ja­panese sol­diers and shot as part of “Oper­a­tion Sook Ching”, to elim­i­nate anti-Ja­panese mem­bers of the Chi­nese com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>In 1972, it was re­named Sen­tosa, which means “peace and tran­quil­lity” in Malay. Mr Boyd says he has al­ways been fas­ci­nated with the is­land’s dark history.</p>
    <p>“The haunted mil­i­tary fort prom­ises an abun­dance of su­per­nat­u­ral ac­tiv­ity,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Once at Fort Siloso, I saw what looked like a Bri­tish sol­dier in his army gear. It was quite a dis­tance away, but I watched his ghostly fig­ure walk through a wall,” he claims.</p>
