    <p>HONG KONG • China’s largest state-run banks op­er­at­ing in Hong Kong are tak­ing ten­ta­tive steps to com­ply with United States sanc­tions im­posed on of­fi­cials in the city as they seek to safe­guard their ac­cess to cru­cial US dol­lar fund­ing and over­seas net­works.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor lenders with op­er­a­tions in the US, in­clud­ing Bank of China, China Con­struc­tion Bank and China Mer­chants Bank, have turned cau­tious on open­ing new ac­counts for the 11 sanc­tioned of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>At least one bank has sus­pended such ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>At some lenders, trans­ac­tions via the US are banned, while oth­ers will now re­view and sign off on trans­ac­tions that would pre­vi­ously have been im­me­di­ately pro­cessed, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Such steps un­der­score the abil­ity of the US to use the green­back’s dom­i­nance in in­ter­na­tional trans­ac­tions as a pres­sure point in the in­ten­si­fy­ing stand-off with China.</p>
    <p>China’s state-owned lenders need to pre­serve their ac­cess to global fi­nan­cial mar­kets, par­tic­u­larly at a time when Bei­jing is lean­ing on them to prop up the econ­omy from the fall­out of the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>China’s four largest banks had US$1.1 tril­lion (S$1.5 tril­lion) in dol­lar fund­ing at the end of last year, Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence data shows. Bank of China had the big­gest ex­po­sure to US dol­lars among its lo­cal peers, fol­lowed by In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China, the world’s largest bank.</p>
    <p>The lenders have been ex­pand­ing their pres­ence glob­ally over the past decade by ad­ding branches, mak­ing ac­qui­si­tions and grant­ing loans to fund every­thing from lo­cal power plants to toll roads.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump last week sanc­tioned Chi­nese and Hong Kong of­fi­cials in­clud­ing Mrs Lam, direc­tor of the Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice Xia Bao­long, and Hong Kong po­lice com­mis­sioner Chris Tang for their roles in im­ple­ment­ing the na­tional se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Their prop­erty and as­sets in the US will be frozen and banks are for­bid­den from do­ing busi­ness with them.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, lo­cal banks in Hong Kong are con­cerned as well since they all have some US deal­ings such as for­eign ex­change and set­tle­ment, one per­son said.</p>
    <p>But the Hong Kong Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity, the city’s de facto cen­tral bank, sought to ease con­cerns last Satur­day by say­ing that lenders in the city have no obli­ga­tion to fol­low US sanc­tions un­der lo­cal law.</p>
