    <p>Ja­pan should not lag be­hind</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>The Yomi­uri Shim­bun, Ja­pan</p>
    <p>To pre­vent global warm­ing, there is a rapid in­crease around the world in the num­ber of ini­tia­tives aim­ing to switch from petrol-pow­ered ve­hi­cles to those pow­ered by elec­tric­ity and other cleaner en­ergy sources.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese govern­ment also must ac­cel­er­ate ef­forts to­wards this goal in tan­dem with the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment aims to achieve net-zero green­house gas emis­sions by 2050.</p>
    <p>In fis­cal 2018, 16 per cent of Ja­pan’s car­bon diox­ide emis­sions came from au­to­mo­biles.</p>
    <p>To achieve the emis­sions goal, it is es­sen­tial for the na­tion to shift to electric ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>While Tesla of the United</p>
    <p>States and other man­u­fac­tur­ers over­seas are in­creas­ing their sales of electric ve­hi­cles, Ja­panese au­tomak­ers have lit­tle pres­ence.</p>
    <p>For Ja­pan to be left be­hind in this field, it will likely lose its com­pet­i­tive­ness in the au­to­mo­bile industry, a key sec­tor for the na­tion, and cause Ja­pan’s en­tire econ­omy to be hit hard.</p>
    <p>Are we win­ning the race?</p>
    <p>Quam­rul Haidar</p>
    <p>The Daily Star, Bangladesh</p>
    <p>Dec 11 marked the fifth an­niver­sary of the Paris Agree­ment ham­mered out by more than 190 coun­tries at the 21st Con­fer­ence of the Par­ties.</p>
    <p>The core ob­jec­tive of the ac­cord is to save hu­man­ity from the ex­is­ten­tial threat posed by cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>To that end, the par­tic­i­pat­ing na­tions agreed to keep the in­crease in the av­er­age global tem­per­a­ture to 2 deg C while en­deav­our­ing to limit it to 1.5 deg C by 2100.</p>
    <p>Be­sides pledg­ing to tem­per the rise in tem­per­a­ture, they agreed to re­struc­ture the global econ­omy, phase out fos­sil fu­els over the com­ing decades, switch to re­new­able sources of en­ergy, em­brace clean tech­nol­ogy and, most im­por­tantly, re­duce green­house gas emis­sions to zero by 2050.</p>
    <p>The ac­cord gives every coun­try the abil­ity to set its own goals to con­front the cli­mate cri­sis, in line with its spe­cific sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>More­over, in­stead of de­mand­ing ex­pe­di­tious and deep cuts in fos­sil fuel use, it al­lows par­ties to peak green­house gas emis­sions “as soon as pos­si­ble” fol­lowed by a grad­ual de­crease to reach the zero emis­sions goal.</p>
    <p>It is patently ev­i­dent that such a vague timetable fits the in­ter­ests of the ma­jor pol­luters, in­clud­ing the US, China and In­dia.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, be­gin­ning this year, each na­tion is re­quired to re­assess its own re­duc­tion plans once every five years. How­ever, there is no con­se­quence or penalty if a coun­try fails to re­assess or falls short of the pledged re­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>Are we win­ning the race against cli­mate change?</p>
    <p>Did we suc­ceed in slow­ing down the car­nage re­sult­ing from cli­mate change?</p>
    <p>By all ac­counts, the ac­cord did not make an iota of dif­fer­ence in de­cel­er­at­ing the pro­gres­sion of our planet, and sub­se­quently our civil­i­sa­tion, to­wards cli­matic melt­down.</p>
    <p>On the con­trary, cli­mate change and its dele­te­ri­ous ef­fects are ac­cel­er­at­ing, with cli­mate-re­lated catas­tro­phes pil­ing up, year af­ter year.</p>
    <p>Our planet is now al­most at the break­ing point. The en­vi­ron­men­tal changes sweep­ing across the world are oc­cur­ring at a much quicker pace than five years ago.</p>
    <p>Much still to be done</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>China Daily, China</p>
    <p>At least 24 coun­tries have now an­nounced new com­mit­ments, strate­gies or plans to reach net zero or car­bon neu­tral­ity. But, as United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral Antonio Guter­res said, that is not yet enough.</p>
    <p>The sense of ur­gency he was try­ing to im­part is ver­i­fied by the fact that not only are the com­mit­ments made in the Paris Agree­ment far from enough to re­alise the tar­get of lim­it­ing the tem­per­a­ture rise by the end of this cen­tury to 1.5 deg C from the pre-in­dus­trial level, but those com­mit­ments are also not be­ing met by many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Guter­res called on all lead­ers world­wide to de­clare a state of cli­mate emer­gency in their coun­tries un­til car­bon neu­tral­ity is reached. But so far, only 38 coun­tries have done so.</p>
    <p>China, on its part, will lower its car­bon diox­ide emis­sions per unit of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct by over 65 per cent from the 2005 level by 2030, and bring its to­tal in­stalled ca­pac­ity of wind and so­lar power to over 1.2 bil­lion kilo­watts, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said in his speech.</p>
    <p>But he also pointed out that de­vel­oped coun­tries need to scale up their sup­port for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in fi­nanc­ing, tech­nol­ogy and ca­pac­ity build­ing.</p>
    <p>Although tremen­dous ef­forts are be­ing made to cut emis­sions, there re­mains a gap be­tween what should be done and what can be done.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate catas­tro­phe near­ing</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>Sin Chew Daily, Malaysia</p>
    <p>If we do not do any­thing to stop the de­struc­tion of our del­i­cate en­vi­ron­ment, there will be an ir­re­versible back­lash from Mother Na­ture once the tol­er­ance of planet earth has been stretched be­yond the limit.</p>
    <p>China and the US are the world’s two big­gest emit­ters.</p>
    <p>Of the 37.5 bil­lion tonnes of car­bon diox­ide re­leased into the at­mos­phere from in­dus­trial ac­tiv­i­ties and the use of petro­chem­i­cal fu­els world­wide in 2018, China con­trib­uted 10.3 bil­lion tonnes, or 27.5 per cent, of the to­tal, fol­lowed by the US at</p>
    <p>5.4 bil­lion tonnes, or 14.4 per cent, of the to­tal. To­gether, th­ese two coun­tries con­trib­uted 42 per cent of the world’s car­bon diox­ide emis­sions.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion has not im­proved af­ter the Paris Agree­ment went into ef­fect, and 2020 marks the third-hottest year in his­tory.</p>
    <p>UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral Antonio Guter­res warned that we are very close to a cli­mate catas­tro­phe.</p>
    <p>Con­certed ef­forts by na­tions to cut car­bon emis­sions are our only bet for the sur­vival of our­selves and our chil­dren.</p>
