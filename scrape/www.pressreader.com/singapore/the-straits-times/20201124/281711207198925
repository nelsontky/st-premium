    <p>TOKYO • Car­los Ghosn’s de­ten­tion for al­most 130 days in a Ja­panese jail was nei­ther nec­es­sary nor rea­son­able and vi­o­lated the for­mer Nis­san chair­man’s hu­man rights, a UN panel has con­cluded in a harsh cri­tique of Tokyo pros­e­cu­tors who led the case against him.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to ar­rest Ghosn four times in a row so as to ex­tend his de­ten­tion was “fun­da­men­tally un­fair”, the United Na­tions Hu­man Rights Coun­cil’s Work­ing Group on Ar­bi­trary De­ten­tion said in a re­port posted on its web­site yes­ter­day. The panel said it would re­fer the case to the UN’s rap­por­teur on tor­ture, cruel and other in­hu­man treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“The re­peated ar­rest of Mr Ghosn ap­pears to be an abuse of process in­tended to en­sure that he re­mained in cus­tody,” the re­port said, not­ing that on at least two oc­ca­sions, he was ar­rested for the same al­leged crime, only for a dif­fer­ent time pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“This re­volv­ing pat­tern of de­ten­tion was an ex­tra­ju­di­cial abuse of process that can have no le­gal ba­sis un­der in­ter­na­tional law,” it added.</p>
    <p>Ghosn and for­mer Nis­san di­rec­tor Greg Kelly were ar­rested in Tokyo on Nov 19, 2018, and ac­cused of un­der-re­port­ing the for­mer chair­man’s com­pen­sa­tion. Both have de­nied wrong­do­ing. Ad­di­tional charges were filed later accusing Ghosn of us­ing com­pany as­sets im­prop­erly.</p>
    <p>Ghosn made a dar­ing es­cape from Ja­pan to Le­banon hid­den inside a large box aboard a pri­vate jet i n l ate De­cem­ber. It was, Ghosn ar­gued de­fi­antly in Beirut later, the only way for him to avoid what he called trumped-up charges of fi­nan­cial mis­deeds con­cocted with the help of his for­mer Nis­san col­leagues.</p>
    <p>His ar­rest and re­moval as chair­man of Nis­san, Re­nault and Mit­subishi Mo­tors shook the foun­da­tions of the au­tomak­ing al­liance he built and trig­gered man­age­ment and op­er­a­tional tur­moil.</p>
    <p>While Ghosn is un­likely to ever face trial or de­ten­tion in Ja­pan, the re­port could be rel­e­vant in sev­eral le­gal cases re­lated to the for­mer auto ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment has called the de­ci­sion “to­tally unac­cept­able” as well as not legally bind­ing.</p>
    <p>The UN panel was wrong in say­ing that Ghosn was ar­rested and held four times with­out be­ing brought be­fore a judge and that the “pro­vi­sion of op­por­tu­ni­ties” to chal­lenge his de­ten­tion be­fore a judge was de­layed, ac­cord­ing to the gov­ern­ment’s state­ment.</p>
