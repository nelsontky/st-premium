    <p>Re­search to de­velop a safe, ef­fec­tive and widely avail­able Covid-19 vac­cine is ad­vanc­ing rapidly. But when it will hap­pen is not clear. Much de­pends on how we gov­ern the pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion of new drugs.</p>
    <p>While the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Covid-19 Tech­nol­ogy Ac­cess Pool prom­ises to foster ac­ces­si­bil­ity, the ac­tual avail­abil­ity of vac­cines and treat­ments will also hinge on lo­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity, which in many coun­tries has been eroded by de-in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>More­over, while uni­ver­sal test­ing re­mains a fea­si­ble, cost-ef­fec­tive and im­me­di­ately avail­able method of man­ag­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic un­til a vac­cine ar­rives, this ap­proach also re­quires man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity and sound gov­er­nance in the pub­lic in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Yet even in ad­vanced economies, over-re­liance on the pri­vate sec­tor may pre­vent gov­ern­ments from max­imis­ing test pro­duc­tion and de­ploy­ment. For ex­am­ple, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has pro­posed a “moon shot” test­ing pro­gramme, yet its ac­tual strat­egy needs clar­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Such a mis­sion-ori­ented ap­proach re­quires a holis­tic, sys­tems-level per­spec­tive, par­tic­u­larly when it comes to “wicked prob­lems” like pub­lic health crises and cli­mate change, which in­volve a wide range of com­plex so­cio-eco­nomic and tech­no­log­i­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>Im­ple­ment­ing uni­ver­sal test­ing will re­quire con­tri­bu­tions from a sprawl­ing net­work of ac­tors and in­sti­tu­tions. To be truly ef­fec­tive, any such pro­gramme must be de­signed to gen­er­ate sys­temic re­silience and pub­lic value.</p>
    <p>As has been demon­strated by Nobel lau­re­ate econ­o­mist Paul Romer, epi­demi­ol­o­gist Michael Mina, a re­cent In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund work­ing pa­per and many oth­ers, a prop­erly de­signed uni­ver­sal test­ing pro­gramme could bring the pan­demic to an end within just a few months. The miss­ing in­gre­di­ents are in­dus­trial poli­cies and other gov­ern­ment mea­sures to co­or­di­nate and steer pro­duc­tion, in or­der to elim­i­nate the bot­tle­necks that the pri­vate sec­tor faces.</p>
    <p>The nec­es­sary test­ing tech­nol­ogy of rapid im­muno-di­ag­nos­tic tests – like saliva-based anti­gen tests that are sim­i­lar to home pregnancy tests and cost less than US$5 (S$6.80) – al­ready ex­ists. Al­though these tests are sub-op­ti­mal in sen­si­tiv­ity com­pared with the stan­dard poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests, they are spe­cific enough to de­tect in­fec­tions at scale in set­tings where dis­ease preva­lence is high; and, cru­cially, they do not re­quire cen­tralised lab­o­ra­tory fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>With a pur­pose­ful pro­gramme de­sign that care­fully con­sid­ers the func­tion­al­ity and lim­i­ta­tions of the tech­nol­ogy de­ployed, rapid tests can en­able de­cen­tralised uni­ver­sal test­ing pro­grammes at the com­mu­nity level.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, tests could be made avail­able free of charge at lo­cal phar­ma­cies, with the ex­pec­ta­tion that ev­ery­one test them­selves on a reg­u­lar ba­sis and self-iso­late if pos­i­tive. The same kits could be used as “in­fec­tion-free” pass­ports for ad­mis­sion to pub­lic spa­ces such as schools and work­places.</p>
    <p>In this case, a new mar­ket would likely emerge as air­lines, malls, restau­rants and cafes start buy­ing cheap, rapid tests so that they can get back to business.</p>
    <p>Rapid test­ing can help to ex­pand and com­ple­ment the uni­ver­sal test­ing strat­egy al­ready be­ing rolled out lo­cally (such as the free manda­tory test­ing at the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy and Ge­orge­town Univer­sity in the United States, weekly test­ing of em­ploy­ees at Ger­man work­places, and the pop­u­la­tion-wide test­ing cam­paign in Wuhan, China).</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar strate­gies need to be launched at the na­tional level, es­pe­cially in low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries where the af­ford­abil­ity and scal­a­bil­ity of molec­u­lar test­ing is low.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries have the ca­pac­ity to pro­duce a suf­fi­cient sup­ply of tests at a cost that would pale in com­par­i­son with those in­flicted by the pan­demic. The num­ber of tests needed glob­ally over a year to sup­ply a weekly test­ing reg­i­men would be equiv­a­lent to less than half the num­ber of cans of soda con­sumed an­nu­ally. More­over, scal­ing up pro­duc­tion of anti­gen tests could be done rel­a­tively quickly and would be a mi­nor ef­fort com­pared with the US mo­bil­i­sa­tion for World War II.</p>
    <p>While bil­lions of dol­lars are be­ing fun­nelled to­wards vac­cine de­vel­op­ment and pro­duc­tion, ad­di­tional fund­ing also must be di­rected to­wards strength­en­ing the test­ing in­fras­truc­ture.</p>
    <p>At US$5 per unit, the cost of test­ing the world’s pop­u­la­tion ev­ery week would come to around US$2 tril­lion. That is far less than the pan­demic-re­lated loss of global in­come dur­ing this pe­riod (as mea­sured by the dif­fer­ence be­tween pre- and post-pan­demic growth fore­casts) and fis­cal stim­u­lus so far this year, an es­ti­mated to­tal of US$20 tril­lion. And these com­par­isons do not ac­count for the costs of lost lives or the po­ten­tial ben­e­fits of achiev­ing new economies of scale in test pro­duc­tion – a spillover that could en­able the erad­i­ca­tion of the sea­sonal flu.</p>
    <p>There are po­ten­tially steep chal­lenges be­yond pro­duc­tion, of course. As prac­ti­cal as uni­ver­sal test­ing is, any such ef­fort could still come un­der pres­sure if gov­ern­ments be­lieve they must choose be­tween dif­fer­ent pro­duc­tion needs for vac­cines, anti-vi­ral drugs, per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and ex­panded med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But uni­ver­sal test­ing must not be viewed as a sep­a­rate item on a larger list of pri­or­i­ties. The point of a mis­sion-ori­ented ap­proach is to cre­ate dy­namic pub­lic-sec­tor ca­pa­bil­i­ties and strengthen the en­tire health sys­tem at once. New test­ing ca­pac­ity should be in­te­grated with na­tional and lo­cal health sys­tems as part of a broader pro­gramme de­sign, so that each leg of the strat­egy sup­ports the oth­ers.</p>
    <p>More broadly, Covid-19 has un­der­scored the need for a more re­silient and re­spon­sive in­dus­trial ecosys­tem that can in­crease pro­duc­tion of es­sen­tial items quickly. Even un­der cur­rent con­di­tions, in­creas­ing the pro­duc­tion of tests and im­ple­ment­ing a uni­ver­sal test­ing strat­egy is fea­si­ble and could end the pan­demic by the year end, while also cre­at­ing the in­fras­truc­ture needed to ward off fu­ture pan­demics.</p>
    <p>All coun­tries need to adopt a longer-term vi­sion and shore up their man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties. By lead­ing on this is­sue, gov­ern­ments can strengthen lo­cal pro­duc­tive ca­pac­i­ties and cre­ate a new kind of eco­nomic com­mons.</p>
    <p>The same mis­sion-ori­ented ap­proach could then be ap­plied to sci­ence pol­icy and in­dus­trial strat­egy, lay­ing the ground­work for more cross-sec­toral in­no­va­tions and the type of re­silient man­u­fac­tur­ing that will be needed to tackle other highly com­plex global chal­lenges. The days when we could pin all our hopes on tech­no­log­i­cal fixes are over.</p>
