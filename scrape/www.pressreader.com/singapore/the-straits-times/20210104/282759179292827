    <p>• Last week, Owen Mooney, a male model and graphic de­signer, said he had been groped by in­flu­en­tial fash­ion de­signer Alexan­der Wang in a New York City night­club in 2017.</p>
    <p>Mooney made the ac­cu­sa­tions in a pair of videos he posted on so­cial me­dia. Soon af­ter, fur­ther al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual as­sault and non-con­sen­sual en­coun­ters were made against the 37-year-old de­signer, posted by In­sta­gram ac­counts that did not iden­tify the ac­cusers.</p>
    <p>Af­ter days of si­lence, Wang re­sponded to the claims and the bar­rage of crit­i­cism he has faced on­line.</p>
    <p>“Over the last few days, I have been on the re­ceiv­ing end of base­less and grotesquel­y false ac­cu­sa­tions,” the de­signer wrote in a state­ment sent to The New York Times.</p>
    <p>“These claims have been wrong­fully am­pli­fied by so­cial me­dia ac­counts i nfa­mous for post­ing defam­a­tory ma­te­rial f rom undis­closed and/or anony­mous sources with zero ev­i­dence or any fact-check­ing what­so­ever.”</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions were com­piled and re-posted on In­sta­gram by two ac­counts with l arge fol­low­ings that have es­tab­lished them­selves as fash­ion in­dus­try watch­dogs –</p>
    <p>Diet Prada, run by Tony Liu and Lind­sey Schuyler, and an­other ac­count ded­i­cated to ex­pos­ing the in­ner work­ings of the mod­el­ling in­dus­try. Their al­le­ga­tions have not been cor­rob­o­rated.</p>
    <p>In 2019, Azealia Banks – a rap­per and song­writer who is a for­mer muse and col­lab­o­ra­tor of Wang’s – shared a se­ries of anony­mous ac­counts on her In­sta­gram sto­ries of al­le­ga­tions of grop­ing by the de­signer.</p>
    <p>In 2017, a per­son named Nick Ward posted a Twit­ter thread that claimed Wang had grabbed his gen­i­tals at a Brook­lyn con­cert.</p>
    <p>In his state­ment, Wang said “see­ing these lies about me be­ing per­pet­u­ated as truths has been in­fu­ri­at­ing”.</p>
    <p>“I never en­gaged in the atro­cious be­hav­iour de­scribed and would never con­duct my­self i n the man­ner that’s been al­leged,” he con­tin­ued. “I in­tend to get to the bot­tom of this and hold ac­count­able who­ever is re­spon­si­ble for orig­i­nat­ing these claims and vi­ciously spread­ing them on­line.”</p>
    <p>Wang’s In­sta­gram ac­count turned off the abil­ity to com­ment on his lat­est post. His brand’s of­fi­cial In­sta­gram ac­count did the same on all of its posts last week.</p>
