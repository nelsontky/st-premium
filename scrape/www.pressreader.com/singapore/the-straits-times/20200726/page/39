        Travel Life | | C11 The Sunday Times Sunday, July 26, 2020 3 VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA (SPAIN) Movie: This 2008 romantic comedy-drama, written and directed by Woody Allen, will take you to Barcelona, Spain.
Two American friends, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), meet Spanish artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). He flirts with and seduces both women, while still being in love with his emotionall­y unstable ex-wife.
In true Allen fashion, it is both quirky and entertaini­ng. But the clearest love story in this film is Allen’s love affair with Barcelona. He is enchanted by the city’s visual beauty and sensibilit­y.
Surrealist architect Antoni Gaudi’s art and architectu­re are featured in the film. The Basilica La Sagrada Familia, Park Guell and the rooftop of the La Pedrera are all spectacula­r seen through Allen’s eyes.
The city’s flair for the arts is also highlighte­d in scenes shot in the Joan Miro Foundation, the Catalonia National Art Museum and the Barcelona Airport.
Of course, you cannot miss Las Ramblas, Barcelona’s most iconic avenue. favourite tapas like patatas bravas (fried potatoes with aioli and spicy tomato sauce), chipirones (deepfried baby squid) and anchoas (anchovies served with vinegar, parsley and garlic).
But try to include Barcelona tapas classics such as bombas (tennis ball-sized croquettes served with garlic sauce and a spicy tomato sauce), pa amb tomaquet (bread rubbed with garlic, crushed fresh tomatoes, olive oil, salt and pepper) and, of course, the classic cured hams, Jamon Serrano and Jamon Iberico.
End on a sweet note with crema catalana, a creamy vanilla custard with a torched sugar coating on top. Catalans usually pair their tapas with a glass or two of vermouth or cava.
