    <p>PU­TRA­JAYA • Malaysia con­tin­ued to see a surge of new coro­n­avirus cases, re­port­ing 1,032 daily in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, even as the gov­ern­ment sought to make its move­ment con­trols more ef­fec­tive in curb­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This marked the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive day the coun­try has recorded over 1,000 fresh cases. Its high­est daily tally was 1,240 cases, re­ported on Oct 26. The coun­try’s to­tal in­fec­tions since the pan­demic be­gan now stands at 35,425.</p>
    <p>It also recorded eight new fa­tal­i­ties yes­ter­day, rais­ing the death toll to 271.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob had said on Tues­day that a new stan­dard op­er­at­ing procedure for con­di­tional and re­cov­ery move­ment con­trol or­ders (MCO) has been drawn up as the gov­ern­ment seeks more ef­fec­tive in­ter­ven­tion in the cur­rent state of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Most of the coun­try is un­der the re­cov­ery MCO, which bans large gath­er­ings but al­lows most busi­nesses and ac­tiv­i­ties to re­sume.</p>
    <p>The con­di­tional MCO, cur­rently im­posed in cer­tain ar­eas in­clud­ing Kuala Lumpur and the states of Se­lan­gor and Sabah, bans in­ter-district travel, has shut schools and re­stricts shop­ping out­ings to only two mem­bers per house­hold.</p>
    <p>Seremban, which is about an hour’s drive from the cap­i­tal, has been placed un­der the con­di­tional MCO, from to­day. Mean­while a sub­dis­trict in south-west Pe­nang will be­gin its con­di­tional MCO to­mor­row, after re­port­ing 35 Covid-19 cases in the area.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri said the new pro­ce­dures were tabled at a spe­cial Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil (NSC) meet­ing chaired by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>“We have asked the NSC to fine­tune, up­date and give im­prove­ments to their pro­posal to avoid any con­fu­sion when it is an­nounced later. We do not want the public to be con­fused about what is to be an­nounced,” he said.</p>
    <p>He did not, how­ever, pro­vide any details on the pro­posed new pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, na­tional oil firm Petro­liam Na­sional Ber­had (Petronas) said late on Tues­day that it had ap­proved an ad­di­tional RM10 bil­lion (S$3.3 bil­lion) div­i­dend to the gov­ern­ment to help fight the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, the coun­try’s Eco­nomic Min­is­ter had said that Petronas would pay the gov­ern­ment – its sole share­holder – RM34 bil­lion in div­i­dends this year.</p>
    <p>The firm, which suf­fered its first loss in nearly five years dur­ing the sec­ond quar­ter, had ini­tially pledged to pay RM24 bil­lion and said any ad­di­tional fund­ing would de­pend on its af­ford­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Petronas said it had ap­proved the ad­di­tional div­i­dend, to be re­mit­ted by the end of this month, in re­sponse to “the un­prece­dented chal­lenges brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic”, adding that it had fully paid the amount orig­i­nally com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>“In de­ter­min­ing whether this ad­di­tional div­i­dend was af­ford­able, the Petronas board first sat­is­fied it­self that the com­pany could com­fort­ably con­tinue to fund its op­er­a­tions, ser­vice its debts and meet its obli­ga­tions as well as in­vest in its fu­ture growth,” it said in an e-mail late on Tues­day in re­sponse to Reuters’ queries.</p>
    <p>“Petronas re­mains res­o­lute in its ef­forts to pre­serve cash and strengthen our fi­nan­cial re­silience dur­ing this un­prece­dented time.”</p>
    <p>The div­i­dend an­nounce­ment comes as the gov­ern­ment pre­pares to ta­ble its 2021 bud­get, aimed at cush­ion­ing the eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic, to­mor­row.</p>
