    <p>For those weary of doom-and­gloom mes­sages on cli­mate change, a star-stud­ded new Net­flix doc­u­men­tary strikes a more hope­ful note, high­light­ing a pos­si­ble so­lu­tion to the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Di­rected by Joshua Tick­ell and Re­becca Har­rell Tick­ell, Kiss The Ground looks at re­gen­er­a­tive agri­cul­ture, a type of farm­ing fo­cus­ing on sus­tain­able food pro­duc­tion and soil man­age­ment in a way that se­questers car­bon, one of the big fac­tors driv­ing global warm­ing.</p>
    <p>This promis­ing new ap­proach has the sup­port of celebrity en­vi­ron­men­tal ac­tivists such as model Gisele Bund­chen, ac­tors Woody Har­rel­son and Ian Somer­halder and singer Ja­son Mraz, who are also in­volved in the film.</p>
    <p>Along with its di­rec­tors, they took part in an on­line ques­tio­nand-an­swer ses­sion to launch the doc­u­men­tary last week – and ex­plain why they think every­one should care about the health of top­soil.</p>
    <p>1 RE­GEN­ER­A­TIVE AGRI­CUL­TURE COULD RE­VERSE CLI­MATE CHANGE</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian su­per­model Bund­chen, one of the ex­ec­u­tive pro­duc­ers of the film, is in­ter­viewed in it along with the other stars.</p>
    <p>She says the doc­u­men­tary dif­fers from oth­ers on the sub­ject “be­cause it does a beau­ti­ful job of ed­u­cat­ing peo­ple and pro­vid­ing sim­ple so­lu­tions that every­one can do” – es­pe­cially when it comes to the food they choose to buy.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old of­fers a brief ex­pla­na­tion of what re­gen­er­a­tive agri­cul­ture is: “a sys­tem of farm­ing prin­ci­ples and prac­tices that in­creases bio­di­ver­sity, en­riches soil and im­proves water qual­ity”.</p>
    <p>And farms man­aged this way are not only more sus­tain­able, but have also been shown to be car­bon neg­a­tive and bet­ter for the planet – more so than those prac­tis­ing con­ven­tional agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>2 IT OF­FERS HOPE AND CON­CRETE STEPS</p>
    <p>Re­becca Har­rell Tick­ell, 40, says the goal of the film is to high­light “the pow­er­ful so­lu­tion that soil of­fers for so many of the world’s prob­lems, from drought to health to cli­mate”.</p>
    <p>“And we wanted to fo­cus on pos­i­tive changes and ac­tion­able things that peo­ple can do,” adds hus­band Joshua Tick­ell, 45, who col­lab­o­rated with her on The Big Fix (2012), their award-win­ning doc­u­men­tary on the Deep­wa­ter Hori­zon oil spill.</p>
    <p>That op­ti­mism and prac­ti­cal­ity were a draw for Bund­chen. “It leaves view­ers feel­ing hope­ful and in­vites them to par­tic­i­pate in this move­ment,” says the for­mer Vic­to­ria’s Se­cret model.</p>
    <p>“In the times we’re liv­ing in, when the world seems to be crum­bling around us, this of­fers a so­lu­tion that can help to bal­ance our cli­mate, re­plen­ish water sup­plies and feed the world.”</p>
    <p>3 ONCE CON­SUMERS DE­MAND THIS, EV­ERY­THING CHANGES</p>
    <p>Somer­halder, who ap­peared in the TV series Lost (2004 to 2010), be­lieves the buzz­word in the en­vi­ron­men­tal move­ment should no longer be merely “sus­tain­abil­ity”.</p>
    <p>“The word is ‘re­gen­er­a­tive’,” says the 41-year-old, who prac­tises this ap­proach to farm­ing him­self when he grows fruits and veg­eta­bles at home with wife Nikki Reed, the 32-year-old star of The Twi­light Saga films (2008 to 2012).</p>
    <p>The key, how­ever, is ed­u­cat­ing con­sumers.</p>
    <p>“Smart and em­pow­ered con­sumerism is what’s go­ing to drive the re­gen­er­a­tive move­ment. When peo­ple de­mand that ev­ery piece of spinach or broc­coli they eat comes from a re­gen­er­a­tive farm, the whole world will shift on its axis and cli­mate change will cease to ex­ist.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are really sim­ple prac­tices, but trans­for­ma­tive.”</p>
    <p>Har­rel­son, who nar­rates the doc­u­men­tary, agrees.</p>
    <p>“This is one of the most im­por­tant ways to deal with global warm­ing,” says the 59-year-old True De­tec­tive (2014) star.</p>
    <p>4 SOIL HEALTH IS CRU­CIAL FOR HU­MAN HEALTH</p>
    <p>Also i nter­viewed i n the film is Dr Mark Hy­man, a physician and ad­vo­cate of us­ing food as medicine.</p>
    <p>“Soil health and hu­man health are in­ti­mately con­nected be­cause the qual­ity of our food de­pends on the qual­ity of t he soil,” says t he 60-year-old.</p>
    <p>The United States has lost a third of its top­soil “and the soil we do have is nu­tri­tion­ally de­pleted”, he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“So to­day, your broc­coli has 50 per cent fewer nu­tri­ents than it did 50 years ago, even if it’s grown or­gan­i­cally, be­cause a lot of the way we till and use agri­cul­ture are prob­lem­atic.”</p>
    <p>This is why re­build­ing the soil is fun­da­men­tal to both hu­man and plan­e­tary health.</p>
    <p>And if re­gen­er­a­tive agri­cul­ture can take off on a large scale, he adds, there will be pos­i­tive “down­stream con­se­quences for the global pan­demic of chronic dis­ease, the eco­nomic bur­den it causes, and the en­vi­ron­men­tal con­se­quences of our food sys­tem”.</p>
