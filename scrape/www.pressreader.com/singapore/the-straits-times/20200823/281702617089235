    <p>A strict lock­down in Aus­tralia’s state of Vic­to­ria ap­pears to be suc­cess­fully com­bat­ing a re­cent surge in Covid-19 cases, but ques­tions re­main about the so-called “pa­tient zero” who sparked the mas­sive out­break.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria recorded 182 new coro­n­avirus cases and 13 deaths yes­ter­day, a sig­nif­i­cant turn­around from a peak of 694 cases on Aug 5.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the state closed schools and most busi­nesses and im­posed a six-week lock­down, in­clud­ing a cur­few in Mel­bourne from 8pm to 5am. The lock­down is due to end on Sept 13.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Vic­to­ria’s Premier Daniel An­drews urged res­i­dents not to be com­pla­cent, say­ing the cur­rent out­break needs to be sup­pressed be­fore re­stric­tions can end.</p>
    <p>“We have to see it as an ul­tra­ma­rathon,” he said.</p>
    <p>“You’ve got to crush the sec­ond wave be­fore we open up… oth­er­wise, you’re just beginning the process of an in­evitable third wave, the costs of which will be even greater.”</p>
    <p>Out­side Vic­to­ria, only the states of New South Wales and Queens­land – out of the coun­try’s six states and two ter­ri­to­ries – recorded new cases yes­ter­day, with nine cases each. In to­tal, Aus­tralia has recorded 24,602 cases and 485 deaths. Of these, Vic­to­ria had 18,029 cases and 398 deaths.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia had largely elim­i­nated the virus un­til an out­break be­gan spread­ing quickly through Vic­to­ria in late May and early June. The state’s surge has prompted a search to find “pa­tient zero” – the per­son who first con­tracted the virus and then spread it in the com­mu­nity, re­sult­ing in hun­dreds of deaths and a shut­down of the state’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, the source of the spread was be­lieved to be a se­cu­rity guard at a ho­tel in Mel­bourne where in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals were be­ing quar­an­tined. There have been re­ports that the guard may have had a sex­ual re­la­tion­ship with one of the ho­tel guests or may have shared a com­pro­mised cig­a­rette lighter.</p>
    <p>The claims have led to in­tense po­lit­i­cal at­tacks on Mr An­drews for fail­ing to en­sure safe pro­ce­dures at quar­an­tine ho­tels. He has been crit­i­cised for al­low­ing the use of pri­vate se­cu­rity guards at these ho­tels, rather than us­ing the mil­i­tary and po­lice, and then fail­ing to en­sure that the guards were prop­erly trained.</p>
    <p>But sug­ges­tions have now emerged that pa­tient zero may have been a ho­tel night man­ager rather than a se­cu­rity guard.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to leaked gov­ern­ment e-mails ob­tained by The Age news­pa­per, the man­ager con­tracted the virus and spread it to five se­cu­rity guards, who then spread it to their fam­i­lies. It was not clear how the man­ager was in­fected. The ho­tel said in a state­ment that the per­son did not pass on the virus to ho­tel col­leagues or fam­ily.</p>
    <p>So the quest to find the orig­i­nal case con­tin­ues. But the gov­ern­ment has ad­mit­ted that pro­ce­dures at the quar­an­tine ho­tels were in­ad­e­quate and that some se­cu­rity guards had breached phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s state op­po­si­tion has de­scribed the ho­tel quar­an­tine scheme as “scan­dal-rid­den” and “sham­bolic”.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews has or­dered an in­quiry into the scheme and it is due to de­liver its find­ings in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts said that find­ing the orig­i­nal source is im­por­tant for un­der­stand­ing the causes of the out­break, but added that the cur­rent ob­ses­sion with iden­ti­fy­ing the per­son has turned into a “po­lit­i­cal blame game” when the fo­cus should be on en­sur­ing the preven­tion of fur­ther mis­takes.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus Gerry Fitzger­ald, from the Queens­land Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy, said the breach at the ho­tel showed that the virus is “highly in­fec­tious” but the first case could have re­sulted from an un­der­stand­able mis­take or mis­step.</p>
    <p>“Every­body wants some­one to blame,” he told The New Daily web­site. “Some­times it is bad luck. The best thing you can do is min­imise the risk.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Adrian Esterman, from the Univer­sity of South Aus­tralia, said the ef­fort to find the orig­i­nal source should be fo­cused only on boost­ing preven­tion.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent finger-point­ing is not only coun­ter­pro­duc­tive – it could eas­ily see the night man­ager des­ig­nated as pa­tient zero un­fairly stig­ma­tised, when that per­son is most likely blame­less,” he wrote on The Con­ver­sa­tion web­site.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews said ear­lier this month that he was un­sure pa­tient zero will ever be defini­tively iden­ti­fied. “I think that whole no­tion that we could nec­es­sar­ily have, to that de­gree of cer­tainty, clar­ity about one par­tic­u­lar per­son, I don’t know the science would ever lead you to that,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It could, but it may not.”</p>
    <p>COUN­TER­PRO­DUC­TIVE</p>
    <p>The cur­rent finger-point­ing is not only coun­ter­pro­duc­tive – it could eas­ily see the night man­ager des­ig­nated as pa­tient zero un­fairly stig­ma­tised, when that per­son is most likely blame­less. ’’</p>
