    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) has clar­i­fied that its land­mark study on the in­ter-gen­er­a­tional ef­fects of di­vorce on chil­dren did not ex­am­ine what caused the dif­fer­ence in out­comes for chil­dren of di­vorced par­ents and those of par­ents who stayed to­gether.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the study found that chil­dren from di­vorced fam­i­lies are less likely to at­tain a univer­sity de­gree, earned less and are more likely to end up di­vorced them­selves.</p>
    <p>This is com­pared with their peers whose par­ents re­main wed.</p>
    <p>A MSF spokesman told The Sun­day Times: “The study did not ex­am­ine what caused the ob­served dif­fer­ences in child out­comes.</p>
    <p>“This means that the child out­comes could be re­lated to cir­cum­stances be­fore, dur­ing or af­ter the di­vorce.”</p>
    <p>She added that the MSF in­tends to study the mat­ter fur­ther to bet­ter un­der­stand the risk and pro­tec­tive fac­tors that im­pact child out­comes.</p>
    <p>It will also con­sult so­cial work­ers, fam­ily coun­sel­lors, lawyers, the courts and fam­i­lies who have gone through a di­vorce, it said.</p>
    <p>The MSF gave these replies yes­ter­day in re­sponse to crit­i­cism from the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware).</p>
    <p>Aware raised con­cerns that the study’s method­ol­ogy “masks im­por­tant sub­tleties in the strength of fam­ily ties, in­come and oth­ers that may con­trib­ute to these out­comes”.</p>
    <p>Aware said in a Face­book post on Fri­day: “As the study stands, it makes a claim of strong cor­re­la­tion be­tween di­vorce and seem­ingly neg­a­tive out­comes for chil­dren, with­out con­sid­er­ing other fac­tors that may un­der­mine this claim.”</p>
    <p>The MSF had said that over­seas stud­ies on di­vorce found that chil­dren whose par­ents were di­vorced po­ten­tially face neg­a­tive con­se­quences even into adult­hood.</p>
    <p>Its study, re­leased on Tues­day, aimed to find out if chil­dren from di­vorced fam­i­lies here suf­fer longterm dis­ad­van­tages and, if so, the ex­tent of these dis­ad­van­tages, which it calls di­vorce penal­ties.</p>
    <p>The study ex­am­ined the eco­nomic and mar­riage out­comes of 101,180 Sin­ga­porean chil­dren born be­tween 1979 and 1981 when they were 35 years old.</p>
    <p>This was done by study­ing the ag­gre­gated data from mul­ti­ple sources of ad­min­is­tra­tive and sur­vey records. Of those stud­ied, the par­ents of 8.8 per cent, or 8,880 peo­ple, di­vorced be­fore the child cel­e­brated his or her 21st birth­day.</p>
    <p>The MSF spokesman said yes­ter­day: “The study matched chil­dren from di­vorced fam­i­lies with chil­dren from in­tact fam­i­lies on a range of ob­serv­able de­mo­graphic char­ac­ter­is­tics to en­sure that we were com­par­ing fam­i­lies of sim­i­lar pro­files.”</p>
    <p>She noted that the study re­ported child out­comes on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>“This means that while, on av­er­age, chil­dren whose par­ents were di­vorced fared worse, there were some who did as well or bet­ter than their peers from in­tact fam­i­lies,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing with the so­cial sec­tor to strengthen mar­i­tal coun­selling as well as di­vorce sup­port.”</p>
    <p>Re­searchers who were in­ter­viewed pointed out that the MSF study did not say that di­vorce causes long-term dis­ad­van­tages suf­fered by the chil­dren, but di­vorce is as­so­ci­ated with these dis­ad­van­tages.</p>
    <p>The study stated: “While the re­sults might not strictly in­form us of the causal im­pact of di­vorce, they pro­vide an in­dica­tive sense of chil­dren’s long-term out­comes as­so­ci­ated with parental di­vorce, which would in turn help in­form in­ter­ven­tions for chil­dren when cou­ples file for di­vorce.”</p>
    <p>Aware told The Sun­day Times that other stud­ies on di­vorce show that the child’s re­ac­tion to di­vorce varies, de­pend­ing on so­cioe­co­nomic char­ac­ter­is­tics and the fam­ily’s well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, chil­dren whose par­ents stay wed but have high lev­els of con­flict have been found to be no bet­ter off – and may even fare worse in some as­pects – than chil­dren of di­vorced par­ents.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwan Jin Yao, who runs a web­site on so­cial ser­vice re­search in Sin­ga­pore, ex­plained that in the past, re­searchers con­trasted chil­dren from di­vorced fam­i­lies with those whose par­ents stayed wed.</p>
    <p>He said: “But re­searchers have moved on and recog­nise that one can­not look at fam­ily struc­ture (whether par­ents are di­vorced or mar­ried) alone, but they also have to look at the qual­ity of the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the par­ents them­selves and the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the par­ents and the child (to un­der­stand the im­pact of di­vorce on chil­dren).”</p>
    <p>He added that it is also im­por­tant to ex­am­ine the sup­port the child re­ceived af­ter the di­vorce.</p>
