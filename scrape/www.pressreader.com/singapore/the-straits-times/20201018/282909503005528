    <p>Next month, it will be a year since I last phys­i­cally met my par­ents. They vis­ited me from Mumbai dur­ing Deep­avali. We then went on a short cruise to Port Dick­son, and, at the end of their stay, they flew home.</p>
    <p>None of this is pos­si­ble now.</p>
    <p>How the world has changed in a year! Ev­ery­thing from travel to birthdays to wed­dings has seen cut­backs in some form or other.</p>
    <p>Sport events are be­ing held in empty sta­di­ums with canned ap­plause for com­pany. Politi­cians are de­bat­ing in Par­lia­ment from be­hind plex­i­glass par­ti­tions. Night­clubs are still closed.</p>
    <p>The heart­en­ing thing is that even with all the changes we have been forced to make to things we took for granted, there are at­tempts at im­pro­vis­ing and in­no­vat­ing so that some of life’s con­stants can go on, al­beit with ed­its and work­arounds.</p>
    <p>One such ef­fort is the plan for a two-way travel bub­ble for leisure trips be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Just a day af­ter the plan was an­nounced last Thurs­day, air­fares be­tween the two Asian hubs soared.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in both places voiced re­lief at the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing able to visit rel­a­tives, friends and favourite spots in the other city. De­tails on how and when are still to be fixed, but it is a step for­ward in ef­forts to re­vive the avi­a­tion in­dus­try that has taken a mas­sive hit dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ad­just­ments and tweaks are also be­ing made in other as­pects of our lives, such as the way we so­cialise and mark im­por­tant life events.</p>
    <p>Cou­ples have swopped large mat­ri­mo­nial cer­e­monies for “min­i­monies” with far fewer guests and less pomp. Some terms such as “lat­er­moon”, indi­cat­ing a de­layed hon­ey­moon, which have been around from be­fore the pan­demic are now more fre­quently used than be­fore. Elope­ment is no longer done in se­cret – it is an ac­cept­able so­cially dis­tanced way to get hitched with just the cou­ple there for each other.</p>
    <p>Staycation­s and cruises to nowhere have re­placed over­seas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>In Canada, some provinces are al­low­ing two fam­i­lies to form a dou­ble bub­ble and so­cialise ex­clu­sively with each other. In the US, a “quar­an­team” can be formed with a small group of peo­ple who are com­fort­able with one an­other and have been fol­low­ing quar­an­tine rules. Some fam­i­lies and like-minded in­di­vid­u­als are form­ing va­ca­tion or travel pods to take trips to­gether.</p>
    <p>Trust among the par­tic­i­pants of these bub­bles, teams and pods that a strict set of health and safety pro­to­cols will be fol­lowed by all is vi­tal for such ar­range­ments to work.</p>
    <p>Choos­ing who to form a bub­ble with is “a lit­tle bit like dat­ing”, Ms Carolyn Can­nus­cio, direc­tor of re­search at the Univer­sity of Penn­syl­va­nia’s Cen­tre for Pub­lic Health Ini­tia­tives, told The Wash­ing­ton Post.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a July poll con­ducted by Vir­tu­oso, a global net­work of travel agen­cies, 79 per cent of re­spon­dents said they would par­tic­i­pate in a travel pod.</p>
    <p>A blog for the Har­vard Med­i­cal School on how to so­cialise dur­ing a pan­demic says that for many peo­ple, so­cial in­ter­ac­tions, meet­ing friends, phys­i­cally con­nect­ing with loved ones are how they re­main men­tally and emo­tion­ally healthy.</p>
    <p>Given that so­cial dis­tanc­ing looks like it is here to stay for some time, a range of low-risk op­tions can pro­vide the nec­es­sary en­vi­ron­ment and sup­port.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are also im­pro­vis­ing. Sin­ga­porean IT con­sul­tant Koh Beng Liang has de­vel­oped a pro­gramme that al­lows wed­ding in­vi­tees to play “yam seng” on their phone while safely dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>If you touch the but­ton at http://djbeng.com/yam­seng.html once, it plays “yaaaam”; two fingers on the but­ton will get you “yamyamyam”; and you can re­lease all fingers to get “seng”.</p>
    <p>At least 1,735 users have played it more than 4,000 times since Oct 1.</p>
    <p>While we can­not do a lot of what we could, thanks to the pan­demic, new ideas and tweaks are al­low­ing us to move ahead, nev­er­the­less.</p>
    <p>Let’s try to em­brace the changes and not hold back from try­ing them just be­cause things are not the way they were. If we don’t try, we will never know what will work in the new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Per­haps this scene is more likely now: A mi­cro wed­ding with 50 peo­ple, each rais­ing a toast and say­ing “yam seng” by sim­ply touch­ing a but­ton on their phone.</p>
    <p>KEEP DIS­TANCE AND MASK ON</p>
    <p>Masks have be­come an in­trin­sic part of our lives, but ever so of­ten, it still feels un­real to see al­most ev­ery­one outdoors with one on their face.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has brought about many changes to our lives, but it is when we step out and see oth­ers with half their face cov­ered that it hits home and feels more real.</p>
    <p>Other changes such as stay­ing at home more, wash­ing hands more fre­quently, us­ing the el­bow to call the el­e­va­tor are not as vis­i­ble as the mask.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to wear one when outdoors as Covid-19 con­tin­ues to in­fect peo­ple. As long as the virus is out there, the mask will be part of our lives – a re­al­ity that is get­ting more and more un­der­lined as the months pass and we wind down to the end of the year.</p>
    <p>So when a photo of a new­born baby tug­ging at the mask of the doc­tor who de­liv­ered him made its way on so­cial me­dia with the cap­tion, “We all want sign are we go­ing to take off the mask soon,” it went vi­ral.</p>
    <p>The In­sta­gram post by Dubai-based doc­tor Samer Cheaib has more than 60,000 likes since it was posted on Oct 5.</p>
    <p>“We hope too this comes true,” wrote In­sta­gram user @choezin.7.</p>
    <p>“God bless to that child cause of his first ac­tion we got a hint that CORONA can end soon,” said In­sta­gram user @fact­card.4</p>
    <p>When asked about the photo, Dr Cheaib told Gulf To­day that he was de­liv­er­ing twins and the mo­ment was cap­tured by the father. “I pulled out the girl first and then the boy. Sur­pris­ingly, the boy tugged at my mask and was try­ing to pull it off my face. We all laughed,” Dr Cheaib was quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes, the day when we can all step out mask­less is a good thing to wish for, and all the signs that point to it are wel­come.</p>
