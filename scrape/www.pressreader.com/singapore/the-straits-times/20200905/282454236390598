    <p>Asia’s wealthy are ready­ing cash to take ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties in fi­nan­cial mar­kets and pri­vate equity once the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic sub­sides, ac­cord­ing to the head of pri­vate bank­ing at South-east Asia’s largest lender.</p>
    <p>Clients have in­creased cash hold­ings to about 40 per cent of their port­fo­lios in re­cent months, up from about 30 per cent be­fore the pan­demic, Mr Joseph Poon, who leads DBS Group Hold­ings’ pri­vate bank, said in an in­ter­view this week.</p>
    <p>While the unit does not dis­close as­sets un­der man­age­ment (AUM), it is part of DBS’ $251 bil­lion wider wealth plat­form, which is among the largest in Asia.</p>
    <p>“Clients are hold­ing a lot more cash than usual. It’s a very in­ter­est­ing phe­nom­e­non,” said Mr Poon.</p>
    <p>“Ul­tra-high-net-worth clients be­lieve there will be a good op­por­tu­nity in the mar­ket­place once the pan­demic im­pacts have flown through the econ­omy,” he added, re­fer­ring to those with at least $30 mil­lion in in­vestable as­sets.</p>
    <p>Clients are con­sid­er­ing fi­nan­cial as­sets, e-com­merce and lo­gis­tics busi­nesses with fund­ing gaps.</p>
    <p>Some plan to use the cash for their own busi­ness needs and may use it to ex­pand com­pa­nies through part­ners, Mr Poon said.</p>
    <p>His in­sights mir­ror a wider trend. Lead­ing pri­vate equity firms are sit­ting on about US$1.6 tril­lion (S$2.2 tril­lion) of dry pow­der, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg, af­ter the pan­demic halted pri­vate equity deals and roiled global mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Still, hold­ing on to cash may mean that some in­vestors have al­ready missed a mas­sive mar­ket rally, with the MSCI AC Asia Pa­cific In­dex surg­ing about 43 per cent since its March low.</p>
    <p>New as­sets in­flows – or net new money – at DBS Pri­vate Bank and an­other one of its wealth busi­nesses more than dou­bled to $5 bil­lion in the first half, Mr Poon said.</p>
    <p>The funds came from a range of des­ti­na­tions, in­clud­ing fam­ily of­fices in the United States, Europe and else­where that see Sin­ga­pore as “a strong ju­ris­dic­tion”, he said.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate bank, which ac­cepts clients with at least $5 mil­lion in in­vestable as­sets, is part of DBS’ wider wealth plat­form whose as­sets grew 7 per cent at the end of June from a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>DBS ex­pects AUM to grow at a sim­i­lar rate this year, Mr Poon said.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the re­gion, DBS is on track to dou­ble the wealth as­sets at its Thai bro­ker­age unit to $8 bil­lion by 2023.</p>
    <p>The bank is also look­ing to ex­pand in the Philip­pines, where it cur­rently has only a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of­fice, Mr Poon said, with­out giv­ing more de­tails.</p>
    <p>“We kicked off some dis­cus­sions last year and are still in the midst of struc­tur­ing the best way to tap the grow­ing on­shore high-net-worth in­di­vid­u­als’ in­creas­ing in­vest­ment ap­petite,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Still, it’s early days.”</p>
    <p>Ul­tra-high-net-worth clients be­lieve there will be a good op­por­tu­nity in the mar­ket­place once the pan­demic im­pacts have flown through the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>MR JOSEPH POON, who leads DBS Group Hold­ings’ pri­vate bank.</p>
