    <p>The world is cur­rently fo­cused on the de­vel­op­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines, with the ex­pec­ta­tion that these will pro­tect the healthy pop­u­la­tion and al­low for a re­turn to nor­mal­ity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is im­por­tant to bear in mind that not ev­ery­one will re­spond equally well to a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, vac­cines are not de­signed to treat a pa­tient who has al­ready been in­fected.</p>
    <p>This is where ther­a­peu­tics come in, to treat in­fected pa­tients and re­store them to health.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers and clin­i­cians have been work­ing hard to find the right mix of ther­a­peu­tics to treat pa­tients suf­fer­ing from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 is a novel vi­ral in­fec­tion, one of the quick­est routes to treat­ment is to repur­pose ex­ist­ing drugs that have been used to treat sim­i­lar dis­eases.</p>
    <p>These drugs have al­ready been ap­proved by reg­u­la­tory bod­ies for other in­di­ca­tions and, there­fore, se­cur­ing ap­proval to use them against Covid-19 can be achieved faster than de­vel­op­ing en­tirely new drugs.</p>
    <p>Take the an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir, for ex­am­ple. First cre­ated to treat Ebola, it has been used as part of clin­i­cal tri­als for Covid-19 pa­tients in Sin­ga­pore, and has been granted con­di­tional ap­proval by the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity to be ad­min­is­tered to se­verely ill Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>How­ever, re­pur­posed drugs have lim­i­ta­tions in terms of speci­ficity and ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral drugs ini­tially touted as ef­fec­tive against Covid-19 were even­tu­ally found to have min­i­mal ef­fi­cacy, or even to have ad­verse ef­fects.</p>
    <p>One ap­proach to get high-qual­ity ev­i­dence about the safety and ef­fi­cacy of the drugs in an ac­cel­er­ated time­frame has been multi-cen­tre ran­domised con­trolled tri­als in­volv­ing large numbers of pa­tients.</p>
    <p>These in­clude Bri­tain’s Re­cov­ery trial, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion Sol­i­dar­ity trial, and the United States Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health’s (NIH) Adap­tive Covid-19 Treat­ment Trial and Ac­cel­er­at­ing Covid-19 Ther­a­peu­tic In­ter­ven­tions and Vac­cines (Ac­tiv) trial, which have re­cruited thou­sands of pa­tients over two to four months.</p>
    <p>In­deed, these tri­als have shown that remde­sivir and dex­am­etha­sone are ef­fec­tive ther­a­peu­tics, while lopinavir-ri­ton­avir and hy­drox­y­chloro­quine are not.</p>
    <p>Clearly, other ther­a­peu­tic ap­proaches be­sides re­pur­posed drugs are re­quired.</p>
    <p>HAR­NESS­ING AN­TI­BOD­IES TO HELP THE BODY FIGHT COVID-19</p>
    <p>A more ef­fec­tive, but length­ier and more dif­fi­cult ap­proach to Covid-19 ther­a­peu­tics is to de­velop an en­tirely new an­tivi­ral drug. Such a drug would be spe­cific to the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the in­fec­tion, or ca­pa­ble of ad­dress­ing the body’s im­mune re­sponse to in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>There are two broad cat­e­gories of an­tivi­ral treat­ments: small mol­e­cules and large mol­e­cules, re­fer­ring to the molec­u­lar size of the treat­ment par­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>Small mol­e­cule drugs are com­monly used to­day, and are typ­i­cally chem­i­cally based and taken orally. Large mol­e­cule drugs are a rel­a­tively newer ap­proach based on bi­o­log­i­cal pro­teins, and typ­i­cally ad­min­is­tered via in­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>A po­ten­tial treat­ment that of­fers much hope in the cur­rent pandemic is large mol­e­cule an­ti­body­based ther­apy.</p>
    <p>An­ti­bod­ies are the body’s sol­diers, formed to fight off in­vaders from bac­te­ria to viruses. They are gen­er­ated by our im­mune sys­tems and have the po­ten­tial to be used for both treat­ment and preven­tion, and can be mass-pro­duced in the lab­o­ra­tory rel­a­tively rapidly.</p>
    <p>One way to man­u­fac­ture an­ti­body treat­ments is to har­ness them from the blood of re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients, which is also called con­va­les­cent plasma.</p>
    <p>While con­va­les­cent plasma can be used to treat Covid-19 pa­tients, we have yet to see high-qual­ity pub­lished ev­i­dence to draw defini­tive con­clu­sions on its rel­a­tive ef­fi­cacy and safety.</p>
    <p>More­over, the ex­trac­tion and pu­rifi­ca­tion of con­va­les­cent plasma to pro­duce neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies is chal­leng­ing, and large amounts of plasma are re­quired to pro­duce a uni­form prod­uct in suf­fi­cient quan­ti­ties, lim­it­ing the num­ber of peo­ple who can be treated with this ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Data from com­pas­sion­ate ac­cess pro­grammes (where treat­ments which have not been ap­proved yet are given to gravely ill pa­tients) on con­va­les­cent plasma in the US also showed vari­abil­ity in the an­ti­body lev­els that are po­ten­tially ef­fec­tive in im­prov­ing sur­vival in se­vere Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>An­ti­bod­ies can also be mass-pro­duced in the lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>Known as mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies (mAbs), they are iden­ti­cal im­munoglob­u­lins pro­duced by a sin­gle clone of a white blood cell</p>
    <p>called the B-cell. They can serve as sub­sti­tute an­ti­bod­ies that can re­store, en­hance or mimic the im­mune sys­tem’s at­tack on dis­ease cells.</p>
    <p>Re­cent ad­vances in an­ti­body en­gi­neer­ing have al­lowed for the rapid screen­ing of po­tent an­ti­bod­ies against Sars-CoV-2 from pa­tient sam­ples.</p>
    <p>The main tar­get of Sars-CoV-2 neu­tral­is­ing mAbs is the sur­face spike gly­co­pro­tein that gives the coro­n­avirus its char­ac­ter­is­tic crown-like spiky ap­pear­ance. This pro­tein paves the way for the virus’ en­try into host cells.</p>
    <p>All mAbs cur­rently in de­vel­op­ment for Covid-19 tar­get this pro­tein, and work to block the virus from at­tach­ing and en­ter­ing hu­man cells.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to their use in an­tivi­ral ther­apy, an­ti­bod­ies are also be­ing tried in a new treat­ment strat­egy which can help to cor­rect the im­mune im­bal­ance that is in­creas­ingly seen in Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The in­ten­tion is to com­bine the use of what is called an im­munomod­u­la­tory mAb with an an­tivi­ral drug, to calm the im­mune sys­tem and tar­get the virus re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>This will al­low physi­cians more time to pro­vide sup­port­ive treat­ment for se­verely ill Covid-19 pa­tients, and sig­nif­i­cantly im­prove clin­i­cal out­comes.</p>
    <p>Apart from large mol­e­cule an­ti­body treat­ments, there are sev­eral ef­forts to de­velop ex­per­i­men­tal small mol­e­cule ther­a­pies which could be more ef­fi­ca­cious and tar­geted at Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These drugs work by in­hibit­ing var­i­ous en­zymes or other vi­ral pro­teins.</p>
    <p>Emory Univer­sity in the US, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with other part­ners, is work­ing on an orally avail­able an­tivi­ral com­pound, and has an­nounced the launch</p>
    <p>of two phase two clin­i­cal tri­als to test the ef­fi­cacy of EIDD-2801 as an an­tivi­ral treat­ment for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other groups, such as biotech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies Ani­vive Life­sciences and Selva Ther­a­peu­tics, are work­ing on other tar­gets like pro­teases (en­zymes which break down pro­teins), but they are still in the pre-clin­i­cal stage and have not yet been tested on peo­ple, un­der­scor­ing the dif­fi­culty in bring­ing small mol­e­cule drugs to the clinic.</p>
    <p>GLOBAL EF­FORTS IN DE­VEL­OP­ING COVID-19 THER­A­PEU­TICS</p>
    <p>The pace of mAb de­vel­op­ment dur­ing the cur­rent out­break has been un­prece­dented.</p>
    <p>The stan­dard time from dis­cov­ery of an an­ti­body to ini­ti­a­tion of clin­i­cal tri­als has been re­duced by nearly half, and it is pos­si­ble that fur­ther larger-scale tri­als of neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies will be started.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Sars-CoV-2 mAbs are poised to en­ter clin­i­cal tri­als in the com­ing months and many com­pa­nies are join­ing global ef­forts to de­velop an­ti­body ther­a­pies to treat Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A few Sars-CoV-2 an­ti­body treat­ments, in­clud­ing those from US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Eli Lilly, US biotech com­pa­nies Re­gen­eron and Vir Biotech­nol­ogy, have al­ready started clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion and the US’ NIH have also started in­ter­na­tional pub­lic-pri­vate ini­tia­tives – like the An­ti­body Ther­apy Against Coro­n­avirus and Ac­tiv re­spec­tively – to pur­sue and ac­cel­er­ate Covid-19 ther­a­peu­tic and vac­cine ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary re­ports sug­gest ben­e­fi­cial ef­fects of mAbs.</p>
    <p>Eli Lilly has re­ported ini­tial re­sults of a 72 per cent re­duc­tion in hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion risk among pa­tients who re­ceived its mAb, com­pared with those who re­ceived a placebo.</p>
    <p>The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion has re­cently au­tho­rised the emer­gency use of Eli Lilly’s ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 an­ti­body treat­ment for non-hos­pi­talised pa­tients with mild-to-mod­er­ate symp­toms.</p>
    <p>South Korean bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Cell­trion re­ported pos­i­tive safety data in its Covid-19 an­ti­body phase one study.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Is­rael bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Ka­mada an­nounced that ini­tial in­terim re­sults for a clin­i­cal trial in­volv­ing its plasma-de­rived an­ti­body treat­ment showed im­prove­ment of symp­toms in Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>How­ever, these re­main earlystage stud­ies, and fur­ther large clin­i­cal stud­ies will be needed to eval­u­ate the util­ity of mAbs in clin­i­cal de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, it is crit­i­cally im­por­tant to mon­i­tor the emer­gence of an­ti­body es­cape mu­tants – mu­ta­tions which could elude an­ti­body treat­ment and lead to re­duced ef­fi­cacy of the mAbs.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers from the Global Ini­tia­tive on Shar­ing all In­fluenza Data (Gi­said), a plat­form which pro­motes the in­ter­na­tional shar­ing of all in­fluenza virus se­quences, have done pi­o­neer­ing work in this re­gard.</p>
    <p>The CoV­surver mu­ta­tions app in Gi­said’s data­base al­lows re­searchers, clin­i­cian sci­en­tists and sur­veil­lance labs to rapidly screen their se­quences for po­ten­tially in­ter­est­ing mu­ta­tions to iden­tify can­di­dates for phe­no­typic (ob­serv­able) changes or spe­cial epi­demi­o­log­i­cal rel­e­vance.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE’S COVID-19 TREAT­MENT EF­FORTS</p>
    <p>Sev­eral re­search groups in Sin­ga­pore are in­volved in the ac­cel­er­ated de­vel­op­ment of mAbs and ther­a­peu­tics against Sars-CoV-2.</p>
    <p>DSO Na­tional Lab­o­ra­to­ries, Sin­ga­pore’s de­fence re­search and de­vel­op­ment or­gan­i­sa­tion, re­cently an­nounced the dis­cov­ery of five an­ti­bod­ies against Covid-19 after screen­ing an­ti­bod­ies from re­cov­ered pa­tients. It plans to ini­ti­ate clin­i­cal tri­als in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based biotech com­pany Ty­chan has also re­cently com­menced clin­i­cal tri­als for a po­ten­tial mAb treat­ment of Covid-19 which was de­vel­oped in an ac­cel­er­ated time­frame.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) is col­lab­o­rat­ing with Chugai Pharma­body Re­search, a re­search cen­tre of Ja­pan’s Chugai Group in Sin­ga­pore, on joint re­search on a ther­a­peu­tic an­ti­body to fight Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The project fo­cuses on a po­ten­tial ther­a­peu­tic an­ti­body dis­cov­ered by a re­search team at A*Star’s Sin­ga­pore Im­munol­ogy Net­work, which worked in close col­lab­o­ra­tion with DSO at their high-con­tain­ment Biosafety Level 3 fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Lead can­di­dates were iso­lated from a high-di­ver­sity syn­thetic hu­man an­ti­body li­brary and they showed high po­tency in neu­tral­is­ing the live Sars-Cov-2 virus.</p>
    <p>A na­tional plat­form for drug de­vel­op­ment, the Ex­per­i­men­tal Drug De­vel­op­ment Cen­tre (EDDC) is sup­port­ing sev­eral lo­cal pro­grammes to ad­dress the im­me­di­ate sit­u­a­tion at hand with a midto-long term view in mind.</p>
    <p>Apart from ac­tive in-house drug dis­cov­ery, its pro­grammes in­clude shar­ing tech­ni­cal know-how on drug de­vel­op­ment with lo­cal play­ers, par­tic­i­pat­ing in the na­tional dis­course on Covid-19 in sev­eral fo­rums, sup­port­ing the de­vel­op­ment of di­ag­nos­tic as­says (par­tic­u­larly the For­ti­tude Kit for de­tect­ing Sars-CoV-2) as well as the clin­i­cal trans­la­tion of novel mAbs against Sars-CoV-2 from bench to bed­side.</p>
    <p>EDDC’s dis­cov­ery pro­gramme on small mol­e­cules that fo­cuses on de­vel­op­ing a broad-spec­trum an­tivi­ral drug is a strat­egy to counter fu­ture novel in­fec­tious dis­ease out­breaks un­der an ac­cel­er­ated time­frame. The cen­tre is also sup­port­ing lo­cal biotech com­pa­nies – As­lan Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, Aum Bio­sciences, and Rhea Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Sciences – to test their com­pounds as pos­si­ble treat­ments for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, EDDC is work­ing with DSO in the pre-clin­i­cal and clin­i­cal de­vel­op­ment of a po­ten­tial Covid-19 ther­a­peu­tic called AOD01, which is a Sars-CoV-2 neu­tral­is­ing mAb.</p>
    <p>The safety and phar­ma­coki­net­ics of AOD01 will be eval­u­ated in healthy sub­jects dur­ing clin­i­cal stud­ies in Sin­ga­pore, fol­lowed by look­ing at the drug’s an­tivi­ral ac­tiv­ity in Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>SPEED AND SAFETY ARE CRIT­I­CAL</p>
    <p>Drug dis­cov­ery and de­vel­op­ment is a process that takes time.</p>
    <p>De­spite best ef­forts, it will be some time be­fore we can es­tab­lish whether some of the new treat­ments work for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>It is paramount that the drugs them­selves do not cause harm.</p>
    <p>In spite of all these hur­dles, why are so many sci­en­tists work­ing tire­lessly to de­velop ther­a­peu­tics on very ac­cel­er­ated time­lines?</p>
    <p>It is be­cause we recog­nise the im­per­a­tive role that these treat­ments can play to save lives, al­le­vi­ate suf­fer­ing and ease the bur­den on health­care sys­tems.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­ease epi­demics have plagued mankind for the long­est time, and are not likely to go away any time soon.</p>
    <p>New pathogens con­tinue to be dis­cov­ered, and ex­ist­ing ones may evolve as well.</p>
    <p>With each bat­tle how­ever, we learn and adapt, and we de­velop new tools and tech­nolo­gies to en­able safe and ef­fec­tive treat­ments and vac­cines.</p>
    <p>As the world tries to over­come the Covid-19 pandemic, and as sci­en­tists talk about the men­ac­ing “Dis­ease X” yet to come, we can draw hope from the scale of co­op­er­a­tion that we are wit­ness­ing in Sin­ga­pore and around the globe to de­velop ther­a­peu­tics – for this pandemic and be­yond.</p>
