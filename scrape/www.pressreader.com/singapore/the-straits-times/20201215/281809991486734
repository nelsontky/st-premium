    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON New York yesterday in­oc­u­lated its first healthcare worker, an in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) nurse in Queens, with the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, mark­ing a piv­otal turn in the United States’ ef­fort to con­trol the virus.</p>
    <p>Ms San­dra Lind­say was given the vaccine at Long Is­land Jewish Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Queens, New York, an early epi­cen­tre of the coun­try’s Covid-19 out­break, re­ceiv­ing ap­plause on a live-stream with New York Gover­nor An­drew Cuomo.</p>
    <p>“It didn’t feel any dif­fer­ent from tak­ing any other vaccine,” Ms Lind­say said.</p>
    <p>“I feel hope­ful to­day, re­lieved. I feel like heal­ing is com­ing. I hope this marks the be­gin­ning of the end of a very painful time in our his­tory.</p>
    <p>“I want to in­stil pub­lic con­fi­dence that the vaccine is safe.”</p>
    <p>Min­utes af­ter Ms Lind­say’s in­jec­tion, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump sent a tweet: “First Vaccine Ad­min­is­tered. Con­grat­u­la­tions USA! Con­grat­u­la­tions WORLD!”</p>
    <p>The vaccine, de­vel­oped by Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech, won emer­gency-use ap­proval from fed­eral reg­u­la­tors last Fri­day af­ter it was found to be 95 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing ill­ness in a large clin­i­cal trial.</p>
    <p>The first 2.9 mil­lion doses be­gan to be shipped to dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres around the coun­try on Sun­day, just 11 months af­ter the US doc­u­mented in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>As at yesterday, the coun­try had reg­is­tered 16,286,343 cases and 299,489 deaths from the virus.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals in Texas, Utah and Min­nesota said they also an­tic­i­pated re­ceiv­ing their first doses of the vaccine at se­lect hos­pi­tals yesterday, to be ad­min­is­tered right away.</p>
    <p>The first US ship­ments of the vaccine de­parted from Pfizer’s fa­cil­ity in Kala­ma­zoo, Michi­gan, on Sun­day, packed into trucks with dry ice to main­tain the nec­es­sary sub-arc­tic tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines were then trans­ported to UPS and FedEx planes wait­ing at air­fields in Lans­ing and Grand Rapids, kick­ing off a na­tional im­mu­ni­sa­tion en­deav­our of un­prece­dented com­plex­ity.</p>
    <p>The jets de­liv­ered the ship­ments to UPS and FedEx’s re­spec­tive cargo hubs in Louisville and Mem­phis, from where they were loaded onto planes and trucks to be dis­trib­uted to the first 145 of 636 vac­cinestag­ing ar­eas across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond and third wave of vaccine ship­ments are due to go out to the re­main­ing sites to­day and to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“This is the most dif­fi­cult vaccine roll-out in his­tory. There will be hic­cups un­doubt­edly, but we’ve done ev­ery­thing from a fed­eral level and work­ing with part­ners to make it go as smoothly as pos­si­ble. Please its first Covid-19 be pa­tient with us,” US Sur­geonGen­eral Jerome Adams told Fox News yesterday, adding that he would get the shot as soon as he can.</p>
    <p>The mas­sive lo­gis­ti­cal ef­fort is fur­ther com­pli­cated by the need to trans­port and store the Pfiz­erBioNTech vaccine at mi­nus 70 deg C, re­quir­ing enor­mous quan­ti­ties of dry ice or spe­cialised ul­tra-cold freez­ers.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, UPS Healthcare pres­i­dent Wes Wheeler said: “We know we’re all suf­fer­ing, our fam­i­lies are suf­fer­ing. We’re go­ing into the Christ­mas holiday with shut­downs and peo­ple are go­ing to be very im­pacted by this pan­demic. We know how much peo­ple are hurt­ing.”</p>
    <p>Healthcare work­ers and elderly res­i­dents of long-term care homes will be first in line to get the in­oc­u­la­tions of a two-dose reg­i­men given about three weeks apart.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has sug­gested that se­nior White House of­fi­cials would wait longer for their vac­ci­na­tions, hours af­ter me­dia out­lets re­ported se­nior of­fi­cials were to re­ceive doses within 10 days.</p>
    <p>Late on Sun­day night, Mr Trump said on Twit­ter that he had asked for an “ad­just­ment” to be made to the plans.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple work­ing in the White House should re­ceive the vaccine some­what later in the pro­gramme, un­less specif­i­cally nec­es­sary,” Mr Trump wrote, adding: “I am not sched­uled to take the vaccine, but look for­ward to do­ing so at the ap­pro­pri­ate time.”</p>
