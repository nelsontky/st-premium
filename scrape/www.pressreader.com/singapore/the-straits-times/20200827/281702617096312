    <p>A 76-year-old man is among 10 im­ported Covid-19 pa­tients an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The per­ma­nent res­i­dent re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on Aug 14 and was con­firmed to be pos­i­tive on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The other nine im­ported cases are two Sin­ga­pore­ans, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents, two work pass hold­ers, two de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers and one long-term visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>All of them had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They were among 60 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed by MOH yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,495.</p>
    <p>Among the new pa­tients are three com­mu­nity cases, com­pris­ing one Sin­ga­porean and two work per­mit hold­ers, MOH said.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 47 new cases an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>No new Covid-19 clus­ters were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Block 4A Jalan Batu Hawker Cen­tre in Mount­bat­ten was added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, said MOH yes­ter­day. Ten vis­its to the hawker cen­tre were recorded be­tween Aug 14 and 23.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>It has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks, the Health Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 155 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 54,956 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 65 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 1,432 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
