    <p>Since Phase 2 went into ef­fect in Sin­ga­pore on June 19, meet­ing fam­ily mem­bers and friends has be­come less re­stricted. Although we are not yet at the lev­els that were avail­able pre-COVID-19, there is ev­ery hope and pos­si­bil­ity that we will ar­rive at that awaited Phase 2 sooner rather than later.</p>
    <p>But it is im­por­tant that we not be too car­ried away by the cur­rent eupho­ria as care and cau­tion must still be the or­der of the day. You must still in­clude masks among the es­sen­tial ap­parel when you leave the house, and although it looks like the spa­ces are more crowded, so­cial dis­tanc­ing is still re­quired at malls, su­per­mar­kets and con­ve­nience stores.</p>
    <p>What is a good bal­ance be­tween cau­tion and free­dom of move­ment?</p>
    <p>That is hard to de­ter­mine but the most im­por­tant ad­vice is to take note of the fol­low­ing tips:</p>
    <p>• Avoid crowded spa­ces. Stick to the Govern­ment</p>
    <p>guide­lines.</p>
    <p>• Un­less ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary, con­duct meet­ings or large scale gath­er­ings via e-mail or tech­nol­ogy such as Zoom or Skype.</p>
    <p>• Find cre­ative ways to do things to­gether although you may be phys­i­cally apart. Use Skype or Zoom to sing songs to­gether, cook dishes or even share evening drinks af­ter din­ner!</p>
    <p>• Be­sides phys­i­cal meet­ings, use the free time to learn new things, or catch up on previous hob­bies that were ne­glected such as read­ing, writ­ing and paint­ing. • Take time for self-care and re­flec­tion to</p>
    <p>in­crease self-aware­ness and em­pa­thy. • Re­solve to be more present and con­nected dur­ing meet­ings so as to make the most of the time to­gether. Don’t take one an­other for granted.</p>
