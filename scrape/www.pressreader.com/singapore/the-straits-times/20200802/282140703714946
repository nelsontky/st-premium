    <p>LON­DON • Six-time For­mula One world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton yes­ter­day shat­tered the Silverston­e track record with a blis­ter­ing lap to put a dom­i­nant Mer­cedes on pole po­si­tion for his home Bri­tish Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>The cham­pi­onship leader, who will be chas­ing a record sev­enth win at the cir­cuit to­day, was joined on the front row by Fin­nish team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas with Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen qual­i­fy­ing third.</p>
    <p>The pole was the 91st of Hamil­ton’s ca­reer and sev­enth at Silverston­e. He made sure of it with a lap of 1min 24.303sec after Bot­tas had led the open­ing two ses­sions on a gusty af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton had spun at Luffield at the start of the sec­ond phase of qual­i­fy­ing with­out dam­ag­ing his car and, while the red flags were brought out ow­ing to the amount of gravel scat­tered across the track, the Bri­ton re­cov­ered in style.</p>
    <p>“Qual­i­fy­ing is a lot about con­fi­dence build­ing... I was al­ready down and I was strug­gling through the first sec­tor in ev­ery lap,” the 35-year-old told com­pa­triot and 2009 world cham­pion Jen­son But­ton in an in­ter­view after step­ping out of the car.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know how, but with some deep breaths, I man­aged to com­pose my­self. Q3 (the fi­nal phase) started off the right way, but it still wasn’t per­fect the first lap, but still a re­ally clean lap and the sec­ond one even bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Bot­tas, five points adrift of Hamil­ton (63) in the stand­ings after three races, could man­age a best ef­fort of only 1:24.616.</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen was more than a sec­ond off Hamil­ton’s pace as the best of the rest, lead­ing the Dutch­man to con­cede that the Sil­ver Ar­rows – as they have been since the sea­sonopener in Aus­tria – re­main streets ahead of the other teams.</p>
    <p>“Mer­cedes are way too fast, you just have to ex­pect that and do the best you can, and that’s P3,” the Dutch­man told the BBC.</p>
    <p>“I’m going to fight and you have a fight­ing chance start­ing third. You could just see pretty early on in qual­i­fy­ing they were just way too fast, as they have been in the last three races.”</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton also feels it will be a straight fight be­tween him and Bot­tas to­day.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, there’s a real big gap be­tween us and third place and Valt­teri is push­ing me right to the limit,” he said. “It still isn’t per­fect but it never gets old.”</p>
    <p>Touch­ing on what should have been a rous­ing re­cep­tion in­stead of empty stands be­cause of the coron­avirus pan­demic, the win­ner of 86 grands prix added: “You nor­mally have sirens and flags and smoke and the at­mos­phere is buzzing.</p>
    <p>“We def­i­nitely miss the fans. Thanks to the team and the guys at the fac­tory, who are con­stantly work­ing tire­lessly and I’m proud to be a part of it.”</p>
    <p>The bar­ring of fans at a race that boasted the big­gest crowd of last season, with 351,000 peo­ple at­tend­ing over three days, was not lost on Silverston­e boss Stu­art Pringle.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton is hop­ing for a full house next year as the al­ter­na­tive, and the fi­nan­cial im­pli­ca­tions, do not bear think­ing about.</p>
    <p>“The piggy bank’s nearly dry. The bank’s stand­ing by us, just as well,” he told Reuters. “The fi­nances are shot this year be­cause do­ing a week­end track hire deal still doesn’t ac­cu­rately rep­re­sent what the cost of keep­ing a Grade One FIA li­cence on a cir­cuit is for a whole year.”</p>
