    <p>WILM­ING­TON • United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is con­sid­er­ing ap­point­ing Ms Gina McCarthy, who headed the US En­vi­ron­men­tal Pro­tec­tion Agency (EPA) in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, as do­mes­tic “cli­mate czar” in charge of co­or­di­nat­ing cli­mate poli­cies across fed­eral agen­cies, ac­cord­ing to two sources.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is also con­sid­er­ing Mr Michael Re­gan, an African Amer­i­can who runs North Carolina’s en­vi­ron­men­tal agency, to run the EPA, the two sources said.</p>
    <p>If ap­pointed, Mr Re­gan would be a sur­prise choice over one-time front run­ner Mary Ni­chols, who is re­tir­ing from the Cal­i­for­nia Air Re­sources Board, as en­vi­ron­men­tal jus­tice ac­tivists and civil rights lead­ers push for more di­ver­sity in the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den tran­si­tion team did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment. Ms McCarthy, Mr Re­gan and Ms Ni­chols also did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has made tack­ling cli­mate change a pil­lar of his up­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion, seek­ing to re­store the US as a global leader on the is­sue while forc­ing all fed­eral agen­cies to re­think their roles in tack­ling the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who was vice-pres­i­dent un­der Pres­i­dent Barack Obama, se­lected for­mer sec­re­tary of state John Kerry to serve as his global cli­mate czar, mak­ing him part of the US na­tional se­cu­rity team and charg­ing him with co­or­di­nat­ing with other coun­ties on the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>If se­lected, Ms McCarthy, who cur­rently serves as pres­i­dent of the Nat­u­ral Re­sources De­fence Coun­cil, a lead­ing na­tional en­vi­ron­men­tal group, would serve as the do­mes­tic coun­ter­part to Mr Kerry. The po­si­tion would not re­quire US Se­nate con­fir­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Kerry and Mr Brian Deese, Mr Bi­den’s pick to head the Na­tional Eco­nomic Coun­cil, both worked un­der Mr Obama and helped ne­go­ti­ate the Paris cli­mate ac­cord, which the US ex­ited un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. Mr Bi­den has vowed to re­join the pact.</p>
    <p>Ms McCarthy was key to writing the Clean Power Plan, a sig­na­ture Obama-era mea­sure that im­posed the first-ever lim­its on car­bon pol­lu­tion from US power plants.</p>
    <p>For­mer Michi­gan gover­nor Jen­nifer Gran­holm is also un­der con­sid­er­a­tion, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is ex­pected to make a slate of an­nounce­ments this week that will be heav­ily scru­ti­nised by the na­tion’s en­vi­ron­men­tal groups, the sources say, in­clud­ing his pick to run the EPA, do­mes­tic cli­mate czar and the In­te­rior Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>The sources said the choices had not been fi­nalised and the sit­u­a­tion re­mained fluid.</p>
    <p>Ms Ni­chols’ nom­i­na­tion now looks less likely as the Pres­i­den­t­elect seeks to di­ver­sify his Cab­i­net ap­point­ments, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Dozens of en­vi­ron­men­tal jus­tice groups in Cal­i­for­nia re­cently wrote a let­ter to Mr Bi­den op­pos­ing Ms Ni­chols, say­ing she too of­ten sided with in­dus­try. In an in­ter­view with Reuters last week, Ms Ni­chols de­fended her­self against the criticism, call­ing it “dis­ap­point­ing” and say­ing she stands by her work.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, Mr Re­gan has emerged as a lead­ing EPA can­di­date, ac­cord­ing to three sources fa­mil­iar with the process.</p>
    <p>Mr Re­gan has run the North Carolina Depart­ment of En­vi­ron­men­tal Qual­ity since 2017 and has been part of the push to hold big com­pa­nies like Duke En­ergy Corp ac­count­able for pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­der his l ead­er­ship at the North Carolina agency, Duke En­ergy agreed to the largest coal ash cleanup in the United States in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Mr Collin O’Mara, a Bi­den ad­viser and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Na­tional Wildlife Fed­er­a­tion, re­mains a pos­si­bil­ity for the EPA, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Mr Joe Bi­den has made tack­ling cli­mate change a pil­lar of his up­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion, seek­ing to re­store the United States as a global leader on the is­sue while forc­ing all fed­eral agen­cies to re­think their roles in tack­ling the prob­lem.</p>
