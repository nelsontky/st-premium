    <p>NEW YORK • Among the many dis­rup­tions this year, in­som­nia may rank high on the list.</p>
    <p>Data on how the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has af­fected sleep is lim­ited be­cause bio­med­i­cal re­search can take years to shake out and most stud­ies to date have been small. But ev­i­dence from China and Europe sug­gests that pro­longed con­fine­ment is al­ter­ing sleep in adults as well as chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The first step to­wards bet­ter sleep is to fig­ure out what is trig­ger­ing your in­som­nia. Once you do that, you can take ac­tion to pre­vent it from be­com­ing chronic – a clin­i­cal sleep dis­or­der that should be treated by a sleep-medicine spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>Stress­ful and up­set­ting ex­pe­ri­ences like the death of a loved one or the loss of a job – two wide­spread re­al­i­ties of Covid-19 – are known psy­cho­log­i­cal trig­gers for in­som­nia.</p>
    <p>If your in­som­nia is tied to such an event, the quick­est way to get help is to call your doc­tor. One thing many doc­tors sug­gest is cog­ni­tive be­havioural ther­apy, or CBT.</p>
    <p>CBT, or CBT-I for in­som­nia, is a stan­dard treat­ment for both acute and chronic in­som­nia and in­cludes a va­ri­ety of tech­niques.</p>
    <p>Med­i­ta­tion, mind­ful­ness and mus­cle re­lax­ation can help peo­ple whose sleep prob­lems are tied to a stress­ful event.</p>
    <p>CBT for in­som­nia typ­i­cally lasts from six to eight weeks and “works for two-thirds to three-quar­ters of pa­tients”, said psy­chol­o­gist Jen­nifer Martin.</p>
    <p>Shifts in habits and rou­tine – in­clud­ing many of the blurred lines be­tween work and home that have re­sulted from the pan­demic – can also lead to in­som­nia.</p>
    <p>Lack of ex­er­cise and struc­ture, for ex­am­ple, can put both adults and chil­dren at risk.</p>
    <p>It may be com­fort­able and cosy to stay in your py­ja­mas all day while work­ing or at­tend­ing school re­motely, but CBT ex­perts ad­vise get­ting dressed ev­ery morn­ing.</p>
    <p>And do not stay in bed all day. You should sep­a­rate your sleep space and habits as much as pos­si­ble from your wak­ing space and habits.</p>
    <p>If you can­not iden­tify a psy­cho­log­i­cal trig­ger for your in­som­nia, it may be the re­sult of some­thing phys­i­cal. An easy tar­get is your favourite screen – in­clud­ing the tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“There is a very clear in­verse re­la­tion­ship be­tween screen time and sleep,” said Dr Craig Cana­pari, a pae­di­atric sleep physi­cian and direc­tor of the Yale Pae­di­atric Sleep Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Screens are bad for sleep as they emit blue light, which can sup­press the body’s nat­u­ral se­cre­tion of mela­tonin, a hor­mone that reg­u­lates the sleep-wake cy­cle.</p>
    <p>For adults who can­not re­sist their phones or other screens at night, ad­just the dis­play set­ting to “night shift”, which changes the colours on the screen to a warmer spec­trum.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts rec­om­mend ex­pos­ing your­self to as much day­light as you can and dim­ming the lights in your home in the evening as part of healthy sleep hy­giene.</p>
