    <p>It was news that would knock the wind out of any­one’s sails but es­pe­cially bru­tal for a go-get­ting 27-year-old.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2017, Ivan Yeo was told he had Kennedy’s disease, a rare mus­cu­lar de­gen­er­a­tion dis­or­der that causes, among other things, pro­gres­sive weak­en­ing and wast­ing of the limb and fa­cial mus­cles.</p>
    <p>There is cur­rently no cure or treat­ment for the con­di­tion which, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion For Rare Dis­or­ders in Amer­ica, af­fects fewer than one in 350,000 males.</p>
    <p>“I was told that in five years, I might not be able to walk or talk prop­erly,” says Mr Yeo, who now uses a walk­ing cane and whose speech is ever so slightly slurred.</p>
    <p>The di­ag­no­sis pushed him into a funk. “I felt like giv­ing up, that life was over,” says the fi­nance grad­u­ate who had by his mid-20s made a tidy sum in­vest­ing in prop­er­ties in Japan and restau­rants in Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>But af­ter a month, he de­cided that self-pity was not go­ing to make things bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“I told my­self: ‘In­stead of liv­ing in sor­row, why don’t you see what you can achieve and how far you can go?’”</p>
    <p>He asked him­self what he en­joyed most, and de­cided it was Evos, the e-sports com­pany he had started as a side hobby a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“It gets me ex­cited so I de­cided to drop ev­ery­thing else and work on it,” he says.</p>
    <p>For the unini­ti­ated, e-sports refers to the world of com­pet­i­tive, or­gan­ised video gam­ing. It is one of the fastest-grow­ing sec­tors in the world. Last year, the global e-sports mar­ket was val­ued at more than US$950 mil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$1.26 bil­lion), up from US$776 mil­lion in 2018. It is pro­jected that rev­enue for the sec­tor will reach al­most US$1.6 bil­lion in 2023.</p>
    <p>In three short years, Mr Yeo, now 30, grew Evos – which started off with a small team of play­ers in Singapore – into a lead­ing plat­form that con­nects e-sports play­ers, in­flu­encers and fans in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The com­pany now em­ploys about 120 people and has of­fices in five coun­tries in the re­gion – In­done­sia, Vietnam, Thai­land, the Philip­pines and Singapore. It man­ages 15 e-sports teams and more than</p>
    <p>400 in­flu­encers with 80 mil­lion YouTube sub­scribers and another 80 mil­lion In­sta­gram fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo’s achieve­ments saw him mak­ing Forbes’ 2019 list of 30 Un­der 30 Asians. The firm raised more than US$4 mil­lion in Se­ries A fund­ing in 2019 and another US$12 mil­lion in Se­ries B fund­ing last year.</p>
    <p>It’s a pretty im­pres­sive achieve­ment for some­one who, by his own de­scrip­tion, was a bor­ing and obe­di­ent teen.</p>
    <p>“A teacher once told me I wouldn’t amount to much,” says the for­mer stu­dent of Monk’s Hill Sec­ondary.</p>
    <p>“I was quiet and scared to speak up or make any noise in school. My par­ents were strict so I led a very shel­tered life,” he says.</p>
    <p>That changed when he left for fur­ther stud­ies in Cal­i­for­nia af­ter com­plet­ing na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“I went to Stock­ton, which has been called the most mis­er­able city in the US,” he says with a grin. “Ev­ery night, you’d hear gun shots.”</p>
    <p>At the Univer­sity of the Pa­cific, where he stud­ied fi­nance, he fell in love with the sub­ject.</p>
    <p>“I got into a pro­gramme called the Stu­dent In­vest­ment Fund where I got to man­age the en­dow­ment fund for the school,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I be­came ob­sessed in any­thing re­lated to fi­nance, in­vest­ment and strat­egy and spent all my time read­ing an­nual re­ports and SEC fil­ings,” he says, re­fer­ring to fi­nan­cial state­ments or other for­mal doc­u­ments sub­mit­ted to the US Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>He in­terned at sev­eral in­sti­tu­tions, in­clud­ing pro­fes­sional ser­vices gi­ant KPMG.</p>
    <p>“I loved th­ese stints be­cause you’d get ac­cess to the best mar­ket re­search. I would read ev­ery sin­gle re­port in their sys­tems.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter his re­turn to Singapore in 2011, he had short work­ing stints with ABN Amro and Bar­clays do­ing risk man­age­ment be­fore strik­ing out on his own to do trad­ing and fund man­age­ment for fam­ily mem­bers and friends.</p>
    <p>When the Ja­panese econ­omy took a beat­ing from the Fukushima nu­clear dis­as­ter in 2011, he spied an op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Prop­er­ties in Tokyo, he says, were then go­ing for a song. With funds raised from his fam­ily and other in­vestors, he in­vested in a cou­ple of small build­ings in the Shibuya and Ueno ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“That was my first break.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est rates were low and the rental yields were very good, be­tween 10 and 12 per cent. The prop­er­ties also started ap­pre­ci­at­ing af­ter we bought them. We made quite a bit of money,” he says.</p>
    <p>Another op­por­tu­nity came along a cou­ple of years later in</p>
    <p>Cam­bo­dia, when a friend se­cured the fran­chise rights to Chi­nese hot­pot chain Lit­tle Sheep.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of the One Belt One Road ini­tia­tive, there were a lot of Chi­nese in Cam­bo­dia,” he says, re­fer­ring to China’s global in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment strat­egy in 2013 to in­vest in nearly 70 coun­tries and in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo reck­oned that a well-known Chi­nese hot­pot chain would do well in Ph­nom Penh, since “Cam­bo­dian restau­rants did not re­ally cater to the Chi­nese palate then”.</p>
    <p>He was proven right.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t ex­pect it to do so well. The first restau­rant could make al­most US$500,000 a month in the be­gin­ning,” he says.</p>
    <p>Within two years, he and his part­ners had opened four out­lets. How­ever, he sold his share not long af­ter when the part­ner­ship ran into prob­lems.</p>
    <p>There were for­ays into other busi­nesses. One, which dealt with Korean skin­care prod­ucts, tanked.</p>
    <p>The idea of start­ing Evos came about dur­ing a con­ver­sa­tion with two sec­ondary friends about e-sports.</p>
    <p>“I was per­son­ally in­ter­ested in gam­ing, and I also had the feel­ing that e-sports would be­come a big in­dus­try be­cause people were play­ing games ev­ery­where. I also no­ticed a lot of tour­na­ments and events – like the League Of Leg­ends World Cham­pi­onships – be­ing held, so I wanted to find a way to get in­volved.”</p>
    <p>The e-sports scene in Singapore was then in its in­fancy.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo and his two co-founders started a gam­ing team by re­cruit­ing play­ers and pay­ing them a nom­i­nal monthly salary. He then set up a gam­ing house for them to play in and pro­moted it on social me­dia.</p>
    <p>“People said I was crazy. On hind­sight, it sounded pretty stupid: Pay­ing people to play games in a gam­ing house, but some­how, we made it work by fo­cus­ing on con­tent cre­ation,” he says. “I was the team man­ager, social me­dia man­ager, video editor.”</p>
    <p>In just a few months, Evos built a social me­dia fol­low­ing of a cou­ple of hun­dred thou­sand. With that, it man­aged to get a few spon­sors and ad­ver­tis­ers on board, in­clud­ing re­tail­ers of PC pe­riph­er­als.</p>
    <p>But in­come was abysmal; Evos made only a few hun­dred dol­lars in its first year.</p>
    <p>His Kennedy’s disease di­ag­no­sis, Mr Yeo says, was a rude awak­en­ing.</p>
    <p>“The first symp­toms ap­peared in 2015. I some­times found it dif­fi­cult to climb stairs or move around. I thought they were mi­nor is­sues, but over time, they kept de­te­ri­o­rat­ing. The doc­tor ini­tially thought it was a back prob­lem but later got me to take a ge­netic test.</p>
    <p>“My ma­ter­nal un­cle also has it,” he says of the X-linked re­ces­sive disease, which means his mother car­ries the de­fec­tive gene on one of her X chro­mo­somes.</p>
    <p>A man who has made peace with his con­di­tion, he does not flinch when asked how it is af­fect­ing him now.</p>
    <p>“Talk­ing is quite hard, I’m not as ar­tic­u­late as be­fore. If I fall down, I prob­a­bly may not be able to get up. I can still walk but not for ex­tended pe­ri­ods of time. I can’t con­trol my fa­cial ex­pres­sions and my throat mus­cles are a bit stiff,” he says.</p>
    <p>He adds mat­ter-of-factly: “I won’t die but I might not be able to walk or talk.”</p>
    <p>No one pulled him out of his de­spon­dency; he did it him­self.</p>
    <p>“I told my­self: ‘This might be my cur­rent sit­u­a­tion but I can de­cide how to choose to live my life. And I de­cided to work around my lim­its and craft an amaz­ing life.”</p>
    <p>He set him­self a goal: To ex­pand Evos’ foot­print and make it the largest e-sports com­pany in the re­gion by the end of 2018.</p>
    <p>It was sound busi­ness strat­egy. Af­ter all, Asean has the world’s most en­gaged mo­bile users in the world, num­ber­ing more than</p>
    <p>500 mil­lion now, ris­ing to</p>
    <p>628 mil­lion by 2023. More than 40 per cent of th­ese mo­bile users play some sort of mo­bile games, prim­ing the re­gion as the fastest grow­ing mar­ket for on­line games rev­enue.</p>
    <p>A visit to a gam­ing con­fer­ence in China in 2017 con­vinced him that live stream­ing was the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“There were so many booths about live stream­ing and all of them were look­ing to en­ter South-east Asia. Since they were go­ing to come in and spend all that money, I asked my­self how I could po­si­tion Evos and take ad­van­tage of the trend.”</p>
    <p>Notic­ing that live-stream­ing plat­forms spent a lot of money on con­tent creators, pro­fes­sional e-sport ath­letes and stream­ers, he went on an ac­qui­si­tion spree and signed up the most pop­u­lar tal­ents in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Be­cause it was a nascent in­dus­try then, it was not too ex­pen­sive an ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>“So when live stream­ing came in and brands started be­com­ing in­ter­ested and game de­vel­op­ers wanted to pro­mote their games, I was the one they had to con­tact be­cause I was the strong­est,” he says, adding that some of Evos’ stream­ing con­tracts are worth more than US$5 mil­lion a year.</p>
    <p>Tal­ent man­age­ment was a nat­u­ral pro­gres­sion, with Evos help­ing its sta­ble of play­ers and in­flu­encers with social me­dia man­age­ment and con­tent cre­ation and pro­vid­ing them with stream­ing con­tracts and brand en­dorse­ment deals.</p>
    <p>He’s chuffed that many of the com­pany’s tal­ents have grown along­side the firm.</p>
    <p>“One of our In­done­sian tal­ents Dy­land PROS had only about 10,000 fol­low­ers when we signed him up in 2016. To­day, he has more than 12 mil­lion fol­low­ers on YouTube,” says Mr Yeo, whose top player Jess No Limit has 20 mil­lion YouTube fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Some of the play­ers in his sta­ble can earn up to six fig­ures a month.</p>
    <p>“In build­ing this com­pany, I’ve seen a lot of lives changed. Be­fore they be­came suc­cess­ful, some of the play­ers had dif­fi­cult lives.</p>
    <p>Some are or­phans, oth­ers were liv­ing off the streets. Be­ing able to see trans­for­ma­tion is what keeps me go­ing, it’s not about money.”</p>
    <p>The fund­ing the com­pany has raised, he says, will be used to grow its tal­ent man­age­ment ca­pa­bil­i­ties and build in­fra­struc­ture, in­clud­ing tour­na­ment and gam­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo, who is sin­gle, says he doesn’t worry too much about the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“It’s tough, but I just tell my­self what a bless­ing it is to be run­ning a com­pany like this. I want to grow, I want to see how far I can go.”</p>
