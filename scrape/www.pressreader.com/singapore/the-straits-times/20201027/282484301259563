    <p>LON­DON • Lyri­cist Don Black won the Spe­cial Olivier Award at a vir­tual cer­e­mony on Sun­day, for a body of work in­clud­ing the James Bond theme songs he co-wrote with com­poser John Barry for Thun­der­ball (1965) and Di­a­monds Are For­ever (1971).</p>
    <p>Among re­cip­i­ents of Olivier awards, Bri­tain’s most pres­ti­gious stage hon­ours, Ian McKellen was recog­nised for his 80th birth­day solo tour while Sharon D. Clarke was named Best Ac­tress.</p>
    <p>Clarke won for her per­for­mance in the Young Vic the­atre’s pro­duc­tion of Arthur Miller’s Death Of A Sales­man, while Best Ac­tor was An­drew Scott i n Noel Coward’s Present Laugh­ter at the Old Vic the­atre.</p>
    <p>Dear Evan Hansen, the story of a lonely stu­dent who fab­ri­cates a friend­ship with a dead boy, won the Best New Mu­si­cal award. The Jamie Lloyd Com­pany won Best Re­vival for its pro­duc­tion of Cyrano De Berg­erac at the Play­house The­atre.</p>
    <p>McKellen’s one-man tour­ing show in­cludes a read­ing from Lord Of The Rings, anec­dotes about his</p>
    <p>Shake­speare days and a re­vival of his pan­tomime dame Widow Twankey. It was his sev­enth Olivier award.</p>
    <p>An­other re­peat win­ner was chore­og­ra­pher Matthew Bourne who col­lected his ninth, mak­ing him the in­di­vid­ual with the most Olivier awards. Bourne won Best The­atre Chore­og­ra­pher along­side Stephen Mear for Mary Pop­pins.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lished in 1976, the awards are named af­ter leg­endary ac­tor Lau­rence Olivier.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Duchess of Corn­wall, who pre­sented an award, urged the­atre ac­tors to stay strong in the face of pan­demic ad­ver­sity as she pre­sented. “I should like to thank those of you whose pro­fes­sion is in the the­atre for your de­ter­mi­na­tion and your flex­i­bil­ity,” she said.</p>
    <p>Camilla, the wife of Prince Charles, said: “Please re­main re­silient – we need you and we have missed you.” Lon­don’s the­atres have in the­ory been able to open to so­cially dis­tanced au­di­ences since mid-Au­gust, but only a hand­ful have done so.</p>
