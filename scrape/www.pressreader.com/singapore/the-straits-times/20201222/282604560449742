    <p>Ar­gen­tinian chef Mauro Co­la­greco, whose three-Miche­lin­starred restau­rant Mi­razur i n France was voted No. 1 in last year’s World’s 50 Best Restau­rants, will open an out­let of his ham­burger chain Carne in Sin­ga­pore in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The out­let, which is the first out­side Ar­gentina and is be­ing mar­keted as a ham­burger bar, will be in Amoy Street and of­fer lo­cal beers from ar­ti­sanal brew­eries here.</p>
    <p>Carne was launched in 2016 by Co­la­greco in his home town of La Plata, Buenos Aires. Its food is touted to fea­ture pre­mium and sus­tain­able in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude 100 per cent grass-fed beef from pro­duc­ers who use re­gen­er­a­tive graz­ing tech­niques for the soil so the fields can be sus­tain­able over time.</p>
    <p>The eggs are cage-free, the veg­eta­bles are or­ganic and the ba­con comes from pork with­out growth hor­mones. Pack­aged in­gre­di­ents are said to have no ar­ti­fi­cial preser­va­tives, chem­i­cals or colour­ing.</p>
    <p>Last year, Carne be­came the first ham­burger chain to be cer­ti­fied by global non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion B Lab for its “mis­sion to make a sim­ple and ac­ces­si­ble prod­uct, with qual­ity raw ma­te­ri­als, pre­pared with haute-cui­sine stan­dards and re­spect­ing the pil­lars of sus­tain­able gas­tron­omy”.</p>
    <p>There are now three Carne stores and t wo fran­chises i n Buenos Aires. On the menu are burg­ers with sides, sal­ads and desserts. There are also break­fast and snack items such as toasted ham and cheese.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore out­let will be opened to­gether with the ilLido Group by chef-restau­ra­teur Beppe de Vito. The group owns Ital­ian restau­rants such as Art, Amo and the one-Miche­lin-starred Braci.</p>
    <p>Carne’s burg­ers in Sin­ga­pore will cost be­tween $18 and $24, and its combo sets – which in­clude fries, sal­ads and drinks – will cost be­tween $26 and $34.</p>
    <p>Co­la­greco told The Straits Times in an e-mail in­ter­view that he picked Sin­ga­pore for the site of Carne’s first over­seas out­let be­cause the coun­try is spe­cial to him.</p>
    <p>He says: “It was there I re­ceived No. 1 for Mi­razur from World’s 50 Best Restau­rants last year.</p>
    <p>“Carne’s phi­los­o­phy is to of­fer the high­est qual­ity prod­ucts from lo­cal pro­duc­ers com­mit­ted to the sus­tain­able pro­duc­tion of food. So we needed some­one who would be­lieve and de­fend those val­ues in a city that would al­low us to suc­cess­fully present our project in Asia.”</p>
    <p>He says he con­tacted de Vito, a friend, to open Carne in Sin­ga­pore be­cause they share the same val­ues and de Vito is re­spected lo­cally.</p>
    <p>While de Vito will run the op­er­a­tions here, Co­la­greco re­mains in charge of the menu de­vel­op­ment, and will ap­prove the prod­ucts and sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>He says he is in­ter­ested in adding lo­cal flavours to the menu.</p>
    <p>An ilLido spokesman says the out­let here will fol­low the same phi­los­o­phy of sup­port­ing sus­tain­able farm­ing.</p>
    <p>While the grass-fed, hor­mone­and an­tibi­otics-free beef will be flown in from Ar­gentina, or­ganic veg­eta­bles will be sourced from the re­gion, in­clud­ing let­tuce from Sin­ga­pore farm Sustenir Agri­cul­ture and heir­loom toma­toes from Malaysian farm Zenxin.</p>
    <p>Carne will also work with lo­cal ar­ti­sanal bak­ers for the buns and lo­cal brew­eries for the beer.</p>
    <p>This is not Co­la­greco’s first foray into Asia. He opened Cote, an upmarket Riviera-in­spired restau­rant, at the Capella Bangkok ho­tel on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>But he sees Sin­ga­pore as a base from which Carne can ex­pand to other parts of Asia. He says: “Sin­ga­pore is a plat­form par ex­cel­lence for new con­cepts and the avant­garde in gas­tron­omy.</p>
    <p>“From street food to gas­tro­nomic restau­rants, my culi­nary ex­pe­ri­ences ev­ery time I vis­ited the city have been ex­tra­or­di­nary.”</p>
    <p>De Vito says they aim to open at least two more phys­i­cal out­lets here and a hand­ful of cloud kitchens in the heart­land.</p>
    <p>He adds: “As travel re­turns, the plan is to open in key cities and re­sort is­lands in South-east Asia.”</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia; Ho Chi Minh City and Danang in Viet­nam; Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Sa­mui in Thai­land; and Jakarta and Bali in In­done­sia.</p>
