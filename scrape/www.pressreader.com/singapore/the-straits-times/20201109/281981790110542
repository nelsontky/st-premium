    <p>The man de­scribed as a de­viant reli­gious teacher here de­nied any in­volve­ment with the group and re­futed claims that he has spir­i­tual wives.</p>
    <p>He said this when The Straits Times ap­proached him on Oct 25 at the lift lobby of his flat in the west­ern part of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He de­clined to say more be­fore walk­ing off.</p>
    <p>Legally mar­ried to one woman, the man used to work as a mas­sage ther­a­pist who also sold oint­ments in the 1990s, said one Mr Ah­mad (not his real name), who was a mem­ber of the group be­tween 2004 and 2007.</p>
    <p>Mr Ah­mad and his for­mer wife, who were in the event man­age­ment busi­ness, had hired the man to bless their events.</p>
    <p>“We later be­came his fol­low­ers be­cause he said he wanted to help other Mus­lims, es­pe­cially women and the needy,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>He said his for­mer wife re­mains in the group, which now com­prises only women fol­low­ers after all the men were booted out.</p>
    <p>Mr Ah­mad, 43, be­lieves she has been brain­washed by the man.</p>
    <p>He said that in 2015, the man promised he would give $3 mil­lion to each of the spir­i­tual wives when the group be­came suc­cess­ful in busi­ness, which he pro­jected would hap­pen that year.</p>
    <p>An­other for­mer fol­lower, Mr Ma­lik (not his real name), at­tended the man’s classes in 2009 and was trou­bled by what he wit­nessed dur­ing those ses­sions.</p>
    <p>“He went into a trance and spoke in an In­done­sian ac­cent,” Mr Ma­lik said.</p>
    <p>“Through a spirit called Mbah, he would ad­vise fol­low­ers on reli­gious and busi­ness mat­ters, and would even scold them for doubt­ing his di­vine pow­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mbah means grand­fa­ther or grand­mother in Ja­vanese, but is also of­ten used to re­fer to leader or cham­pion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­lik left the group one month later.</p>
