    <p>For some man­agers, the guess­ing game ends about 75 min­utes be­fore kick-off. They re­ceive the op­po­si­tion’s team sheet and the ques­tions are an­swered. Not for Bren­dan Rodgers tonight.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­u­larly in his younger days, the Le­ices­ter man­ager was noted for un­ex­pected choices. Now the man­tle of the most un­pre­dictable man in the dugout may have been ap­pro­pri­ated by Mikel Arteta. Few sur­prise more with their se­lec­tions.</p>
    <p>Say Bukayo Saka’s name ap­pears. Be­yond sig­ni­fy­ing a prodigy’s progress, that re­veals noth­ing. Saka has ex­celled as a left-back, left wing-back, left winger, right winger and cen­tral mid­fielder for Arteta, so he could be de­ployed in any po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>See Kieran Tier­ney start and it does not nec­es­sar­ily solve the puz­zle. The Scot could be the left of three cen­tre-backs, a left-back or a wing-back.</p>
    <p>Nor is the system nec­es­sar­ily a clue. Arteta has tended to veer be­tween 3-4-3 and 4-3-3, but he has also used 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2.</p>
    <p>Per­haps such flex­i­bil­ity might be ex­pected from Pep Guardi­ola’s pro­tege. Cer­tainly Arteta shares his men­tor’s ca­pac­ity for in­ven­tive think­ing and the or­gan­i­sa­tional and coach­ing prow­ess to make some of his left-field ideas work. Nor is prece­dent nec­es­sar­ily a guide.</p>
    <p>Wil­lian im­ple­mented tac­ti­cal in­struc­tions at Chelsea but he was pri­mar­ily a hard-work­ing winger. He was rein­vented as a false nine at Manch­ester City last week and, if that gam­bit did not pay off, Arteta has sig­nalled he will prob­a­bly re­vive it. But, with­out say­ing when, he can plant a seed of doubt in op­po­nents’ minds.</p>
    <p>Like Guardi­ola, he can look at a player’s raw ma­te­ri­als and imag­ine the pos­si­bil­i­ties. He in­her­ited Ains­ley Mait­land-Niles, who had a stated pref­er­ence for cen­tral mid­field and was a re­luc­tant right-back. He re­cast him as a left wing-back, to huge suc­cess in Wem­b­ley wins in the FA Cup semi-fi­nal and fi­nal and the Com­mu­nity Shield, con­vert­ing a fringe player into an Eng­land in­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Arteta’s un­ortho­doxy is most ap­par­ent in what has be­come Arse­nal’s flag­ship goal, fea­tur­ing the seem­ingly risky pol­icy of pass­ing in their own penalty box, in­volv­ing their goal­keeper and then, af­ter lur­ing op­po­nents for­ward, sud­denly spring­ing a counter-at­tack. Play­ing out from the back cost Arse­nal a goal against Rapid Vi­enna on Thursday, but brought them strikes against Manch­ester City, Ful­ham and Liver­pool (in the Com­mu­nity Shield).</p>
    <p>If it is un­de­ni­able that Arteta has got Arse­nal’s own­ers to in­vest, par­tic­u­larly in Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang’s new con­tract and the £45 mil­lion (S$79 mil­lion) sign­ing of Thomas Partey, they are nev­er­the­less be­ing trans­formed by ideas.</p>
    <p>Arteta has an in­tel­lec­tual’s cu­rios­ity to ex­per­i­ment, but there is ra­tio­nale be­hind his de­vi­a­tions. Arse­nal’s squad are still ar­guably only the sixth best in Eng­land. Out­fox­ing his op­po­site num­bers is a way of cam­ou­flag­ing weak­nesses and em­pha­sis­ing strengths.</p>
    <p>When he fields three cen­tre-backs, it is in part be­cause he may not fully trust any two. He has a soli­tary world-class player in Aubameyang and, if he is im­prov­ing oth­ers, the club’s other main match-win­ner is not one of his sign­ings. Be­cause the irony with sidelin­ing Me­sut Ozil is that the most cre­ative fig­ure in­volved at Arse­nal now is Arteta him­self.</p>
