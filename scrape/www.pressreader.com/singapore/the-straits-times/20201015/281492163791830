    <p>Com­muters on three MRT lines were hit dur­ing yes­ter­day’s evening rush hour by one of the worst power-re­lated dis­rup­tions on the train net­work in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>And with the Covid-19 pan­demic, there were also con­cerns about the safety of af­fected pas­sen­gers who were stuck in trains or crowd­ing in sta­tions or bus stops due to the break­down.</p>
    <p>There were no train ser­vices on parts of the North-South and EastWest lines at about 7pm, and later on the Cir­cle Line at 7.30pm due to a power fault. The break­down was caused by a faulty power ca­ble, ac­cord­ing to ini­tial in­ves­ti­ga­tions, said the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA). All the three af­fected lines are run by public trans­port op­er­a­tor SMRT Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Apol­o­gis­ing to pas­sen­gers, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said that the safety of com­muters “re­mained top­most on our minds tonight”, not­ing that some peo­ple were un­well dur­ing the break­down.</p>
    <p>As there are stu­dents tak­ing na­tional ex­am­i­na­tions to­day, he said that “we are on standby to help each and ev­ery child get to their cen­tres safely and on time”.</p>
    <p>Many com­muters were stuck in trains for hours when the power went out last night. SMRT helped to de­train them but when it be­gan to rain heav­ily at one point, this was tem­po­rar­ily put on hold.</p>
    <p>Dense crowds were also seen at bus stops as peo­ple waited to board free bus ser­vices that were ac­ti­vated. Some com­muters were con­cerned about the spread of Covid-19 with the large crowds be­cause it was tough to keep a safe dis­tance from other peo­ple.</p>
    <p>By 10.35pm, train ser­vices had re­sumed.</p>
    <p>LTA said it is work­ing with SMRT on rec­ti­fi­ca­tion works and it will in­ves­ti­gate the break­down’s causes.</p>
    <p>A power fault shut down train ser­vice along parts of the North-South and East-West MRT lines at around 7pm yes­ter­day, se­verely dis­rupt­ing the evening rush-hour com­mute for many pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>At 7.30pm, the ma­jor fault dis­rupted ser­vice along a 16-sta­tion stretch of the Cir­cle Line (CCL).</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that a faulty power ca­ble had caused the 31/ 2- hour break­down, which was one of the most se­ri­ous power-re­lated in­ci­dents to hit the MRT net­work in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) said in a state­ment that ser­vice on t he CCL re­sumed at 8.40pm, while ser­vice re­sumed at all sta­tions on the North-South and East-West lines at 10.35pm.</p>
    <p>The power fault caused black­outs at sta­tions and stranded com­muters in trains along the tracks.</p>
    <p>Such a ma­jor dis­rup­tion amid the Covid-19 pan­demic also raised fears among some com­muters about con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus, as the crowds that formed at cer­tain sta­tions as a re­sult of the break­down made safe dis­tanc­ing im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>One such com­muter was con­cept artist R. Fong, 28, who was stuck on the train at Kranji from 7.04pm to 8.24pm. He said he was “def­i­nitely wor­ried about Covid-19 be­cause so­cial dis­tanc­ing on the train was non-ex­is­tent”.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tor SMRT started to de­train pas­sen­gers who were stuck on trains on the North-South and EastWest lines at 7.30pm, and on the CCL at 8pm. How­ever, SMRT had to stop this process when it be­gan rain­ing heav­ily.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said the power trip dis­rupted ser­vice be­tween Wood­lands and Jurong East on the North-South Line, be­tween Gul Cir­cle and Queen­stown on the East-West Line, and be­tween Har­bourFront and Seran­goon on the CCL.</p>
    <p>“(It) has been a rough and stress­ful evening for many com­muters. We are sorry for the dis­rup­tion and all the trou­bles caused,” he said.</p>
    <p>Around 115 bridg­ing buses and 400 SMRT staff were de­ployed to af­fected sta­tions to help com­muters.</p>
    <p>“(The) safety of the com­muters re­mained top­most on our minds tonight,” Mr Ong said, adding that the fault was iso­lated at 10.34pm.</p>
    <p>“The engi­neer­ing team will work through the night to rec­tify the prob­lem,” he said. “There will be stu­dents tak­ing na­tional ex­ams tomorrow and we are on standby to help each and ev­ery child get to their cen­tres safely and on time.”</p>
    <p>There are O- and A- level ex­am­i­na­tions tak­ing place to­day.</p>
    <p>SMRT said it is work­ing with the LTA to carry out a full in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Announceme­nts on the dis­rup­tions were made at all MRT sta­tions to in­form com­muters, said LTA, as well as on its web­sites and the Twit­ter ac­counts of LTA and SMRT.</p>
    <p>Com­muters re­ported black­outs at Boon Lay sta­tion. At Choa Chu Kang sta­tion, pas­sen­gers were de­trained and had to walk on the train tracks that run above the street.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times ar­rived at Jurong East sta­tion, it was dark and po­lice of­fi­cers were pre­vent­ing peo­ple from go­ing through the gantries. Sta­tion staff later closed</p>
    <p>The engi­neer­ing team will work through the night to rec­tify the prob­lem... There will be stu­dents tak­ing na­tional ex­ams tomorrow and we are on standby to help each and ev­ery child get to their cen­tres safely and on time.</p>
    <p>TRANS­PORT MIN­IS­TER ONG YE KUNG</p>
    <p>I got here and was stunned. So many peo­ple were leav­ing and the lights were off, so I im­me­di­ately knew some­thing was wrong... But they should have put more signs up.</p>
    <p>MADAM TAN, a teacher, who had just ar­rived at Jurong East sta­tion and was on her way home to Choa Chu Kang.</p>
    <p>the gates to the MRT sta­tion to pre­vent peo­ple from en­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>As peo­ple gath­ered around MRT staff at the base of the es­ca­la­tors at Jurong East, a man who looked to be in his 50s col­lapsed at about 9pm. He was quickly tended to by mem­bers of the public, as po­lice of­fi­cers told the crowds to back away.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter, a Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force am­bu­lance ar­rived at the bus interchang­e near the MRT sta­tion and the man was con­scious as he was taken away in a wheel­chair.</p>
    <p>One com­muter, a 45-year-old teacher who wanted to be known only as Madam Tan, was car­ry­ing her din­ner and star­ing in­tently at a bus ser­vice pam­phlet. She said she had just ar­rived at the sta­tion and was on her way home to Choa Chu Kang.</p>
    <p>“I got here and was stunned. So many peo­ple were leav­ing and the lights were off, so I im­me­di­ately knew some­thing was wrong,” she said. “But they should have put more signs up.”</p>
    <p>An­other com­muter, Mr Omar Ab­dul Ghani, 27, was on his way home from work as part of a ship crew at Jurong Is­land when he ar­rived at Jurong East sta­tion.</p>
    <p>“I just got here and am a bit an­noyed be­cause now I have to take a Grab (ride) home to Mar­sil­ing.”</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity of­fi­cer Jaz­imi Su­hood, 44, was sit­ting and wait­ing by the gantry af­ter ar­riv­ing at about 8.15pm. “At first, I was won­der­ing what hap­pened. Then I checked Twit­ter and peo­ple were say­ing there was a power black­out. I’m just happy I wasn’t on the train when it hap­pened,” he said.</p>
