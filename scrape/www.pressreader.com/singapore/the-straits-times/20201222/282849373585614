    <p>LON­DON • Meghan Markle has set­tled a claim against a news agency which took pho­to­graphs of her and her young son Archie in a Canadian park, the High Court in Lon­don was told last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Duchess of Sus­sex brought pri­vacy and data pro­tec­tion claims against the Splash News and Pic­ture Agency in March over the long-lens pho­to­graphs. A lawyer for the Amer­i­can for­mer tele­vi­sion ac­tress, who mar­ried Prince Harry in 2018, said Splash UK went into ad­min­is­tra­tion af­ter the claim was is­sued and served.</p>
    <p>Judge Matthew Nick­lin told the hear­ing: “In the light of the ad­min­is­tra­tion, the par­ties have agreed to set­tle the claim against Splash UK.</p>
    <p>“The ad­min­is­tra­tors of Splash UK have un­der­taken that, should the en­tity come out of ad­min­is­tra­tion, Splash UK will not take any pho­to­graphs of the duke and duchess or their son in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The pho­to­graphs were taken on Jan 20 this year, show­ing Markle walk­ing with Archie in a baby sling and her two dogs in Horth Hill Re­gional Park on Van­cou­ver Is­land.</p>
    <p>Her lawyer Jenny Afia said a Splash pho­tog­ra­pher had made a “full re­con­nais­sance in­spec­tion” of the house where they were stay­ing and put his cam­era over the fence to take pic­tures. Law firm Schillings said the set­tle­ment was “a clear sig­nal that un­law­ful, in­va­sive and in­tru­sive pa­parazzi be­hav­iour will not be tol­er­ated”. A sep­a­rate but sim­i­lar claim against Splash US is also be­fore the Bri­tish courts, it added.</p>
    <p>The claim is one of sev­eral brought by the duke and duchess against me­dia groups since the cou­ple stepped down from the royal front­line.</p>
    <p>Prince Harry, who is Queen El­iz­a­beth II’s grand­son, has said the sound of cam­eras was a con­stant re­minder of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.</p>
    <p>She was killed in a high-speed car crash in Paris in 1997 as she tried to es­cape pa­parazzi.</p>
    <p>Since mov­ing to Cal­i­for­nia, Prince Harry and Markle have signed big-money con­tracts with stream­ing gi­ants Net­flix and Spo­tify to pro­duce films and pod­casts.</p>
