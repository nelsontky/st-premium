    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) has re­but­ted al­le­ga­tions that it failed to take ac­tion for four years against a man’s de­viant re­li­gious teach­ings that were brought to the pub­lic’s at­ten­tion last month.</p>
    <p>It said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that it had in­ves­ti­gated the man, a for­mer mas­sage ther­a­pist in his 50s, and taken ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion, adding that it is work­ing with the rel­e­vant agen­cies to con­duct a fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Muis’ de­ci­sion to re-in­ves­ti­gate this al­leged leader of a de­viant re­li­gious group here comes af­ter The Straits Times’ ex­pose on the man and the group, pub­lished on Nov 9.</p>
    <p>Muis’ ear­lier state­ment on the mat­ter, on Nov 10, re­vealed that it was first alerted to the case in 2018 and had taken ac­tion then.</p>
    <p>But some in­di­vid­u­als on­line have claimed that the coun­cil did not ad­dress the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“Re­cently, there have been post­ings on so­cial me­dia al­leg­ing that Muis failed to take ac­tion for four years against a case of de­viant teach­ings un­til the case was brought to the pub­lic’s at­ten­tion in 2020. Th­ese state­ments are fac­tu­ally in­ac­cu­rate,” said Muis.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil pointed to how it had al­ready in­ves­ti­gated the mat­ter in 2018 and taken nec­es­sary ac­tion, in­clud­ing in­ter­view­ing the man and is­su­ing a for­mal ad­vi­sory for him to cease his ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It is be­lieved that the man has led the group, whose fe­male fol­low­ers help run a small restau­rant and an event man­age­ment busi­ness, for 15 years. ST re­ported that among his teach­ings, the man pro­fesses to be Prophet Muham­mad, per­mits gam­bling to help needy Mus­lims, and as­pires to have 13 spir­i­tual wives.</p>
    <p>Muis’ for­mal ad­vi­sory to the man – who is not a qual­i­fied or reg­is­tered re­li­gious teacher un­der the Asati­zah Recog­ni­tion Scheme – was to cease his re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties im­me­di­ately. Yes­ter­day, the coun­cil re­peated its call for those with cred­i­ble ev­i­dence about the man to come for­ward and aid its in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Those with re­li­able ev­i­dence such as e-mail, record­ings and other documents, and who are will­ing to tes­tify, should make their sub­mis­sions to it be­fore Dec 11, Muis said, re­peat­ing its ear­lier ap­peal for such ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>While ac­knowl­edg­ing that the Mus­lim com­mu­nity here has been deeply con­cerned about the is­sue of de­viant teach­ings, Muis said the pub­lic has to act re­spon­si­bly, es­pe­cially when com­ment­ing on so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil added: “We should also not com­ment when a mat­ter is still un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion, lest we un­wit­tingly cast as­per­sions and false­hoods on par­ties who may be in­no­cent. This is against the spirit of the law and the prin­ci­ples of nat­u­ral jus­tice.”</p>
    <p>Muis said it has been ac­cused of be­ing not se­ri­ous in com­bat­ing de­viant teach­ings, with some even ques­tion­ing its over­all re­spon­sive­ness in fa­cil­i­tat­ing the so­cio-re­li­gious life of the Mus­lim com­mu­nity here.</p>
    <p>Such re­marks are “deeply un­for­tu­nate”, said the coun­cil, high­light­ing how it is com­mit­ted to supporting the com­mu­nity, for in­stance, by strength­en­ing re­li­gious schools here, fight­ing the threat of ex­trem­ism and help­ing peo­ple adapt to dis­rup­tions from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It warned that it would not hes­i­tate to take le­gal ac­tion against those who con­tinue to spread false­hoods and un­founded al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“As an or­gan­i­sa­tion that serves the com­mu­nity and works closely with the Mus­lim com­mu­nity, we are a firm be­liever in con­sul­ta­tion and are open to feed­back,” said Muis.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, we do not ap­pre­ci­ate un­founded al­le­ga­tions and as­per­sions which serve to erode the trust and close re­la­tion­ship be­tween Muis and the com­mu­nity.”</p>
