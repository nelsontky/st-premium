    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) has called for an open re­view of var­i­ous race-based poli­cies, in­clud­ing the Chi­nese, Malay, In­dian and Other (CMIO) model of eth­nic clas­si­fi­ca­tion as well as the Hous­ing Board’s Eth­nic In­te­gra­tion Pol­icy (EIP).</p>
    <p>The EIP sets the pro­por­tion of flats in a pub­lic hous­ing block and precinct that can be owned by a par­tic­u­lar racial group.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, Ms Lim sug­gested six ar­eas that could be re­viewed to move Sin­ga­pore along in its “jour­ney to­wards be­ing a race-blind so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>“I am ag­nos­tic about the ex­act form of the re­view I’m ask­ing for. We should in­clude aca­demics with rel­e­vant ex­per­tise, and also en­sure that there is fair rep­re­sen­ta­tion of cit­i­zens across dif­fer­ent age groups,” she added.</p>
    <p>ETH­NIC CLAS­SI­FI­CA­TIONS LIKE CMIO</p>
    <p>Ms Lim noted that the CMIO model was first used in colo­nial Sin­ga­pore in 1824.</p>
    <p>She said the Govern­ment has recog­nised the ris­ing num­ber of mixed mar­riages by let­ting the chil­dren of such unions be reg­is­tered un­der a dou­ble-bar­relled eth­nic­ity.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the Govern­ment de­fend­ing the CMIO model as nec­es­sary to safe­guard mi­nor­ity rights, she said the con­cept of mi­nor­ity rights it­self is prob­lem­atic.</p>
    <p>So, it would be bet­ter to dis­cuss cit­i­zen­ship rights, she added.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, with more and more in­ter-eth­nic mar­riages, where the bride and groom are them­selves of mixed parent­age, I won­der how the CMIO clas­si­fi­ca­tions can with­stand the test of time.”</p>
    <p>RACE-BASED SELF-HELP GROUPS</p>
    <p>The four race-based self-help groups, namely the Chi­nese Devel­op­ment As­sis­tance Coun­cil, Sin­ga­pore In­dian Devel­op­ment As­so­ci­a­tion, Men­daki and the Eurasian As­so­ci­a­tion, are i nformed by the CMIO model, said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>“Not­with­stand­ing the good work they have done, the fact is that they re­in­force racial con­scious­ness.”</p>
    <p>She sug­gested amal­ga­mat­ing the self-help groups into a na­tional body to pool re­sources with­out re­gard to race.</p>
    <p>“I’m aware of an ef­fort to col­lab­o­rate in this di­rec­tion in Yishun called the Self-Help Groups Cen­tre, and hope we can go much fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>MORE PUB­LIC DIS­CLO­SURE OF RACE-BASED DATA</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said the Govern­ment col­lects ex­ten­sive data on race but is se­lec­tive on what is made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>She ac­knowl­edged that there may be rea­sons for this se­lec­tiv­ity, but data on race is needed, she said, to un­der­stand is­sues that af­fect par­tic­u­lar com­mu­ni­ties, in or­der to nar­row the dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>She re­called a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion she had filed, ask­ing for the com­po­si­tion of the prison in­mate pop­u­la­tion bro­ken down by eth­nic group. This in­for­ma­tion is re­leased by other gov­ern­ments “as a mat­ter of course”, she said.</p>
    <p>“The an­swer given was that the Pris­ons Depart­ment was un­able to share the statis­tics. No ex­pla­na­tion was given,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said these mat­ters de­serve wider study by re­searchers out­side the Govern­ment, and there should be greater pub­lic aware­ness of chal­lenges faced by par­tic­u­lar eth­nic com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>THE ROLE OF RACE IN ELEC­TIONS</p>
    <p>Since 1988, Sin­ga­pore’s group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency sys­tem has re­quired po­lit­i­cal par­ties to field can­di­dates from des­ig­nated mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties, and more re­cent changes have been made to the elected pres­i­dency to in­tro­duce an eth­nic re­quire­ment, she noted.</p>
    <p>But in an ideal sit­u­a­tion, no such safe­guards would be needed as the elec­torate would be race-blind enough to elect can­di­dates of dif­fer­ent eth­nic­i­ties nat­u­rally, she said.</p>
    <p>Such re­quire­ments put a fo­cus on mi­nor­ity rep­re­sen­ta­tion, which can put an un­com­fort­able spot­light on mi­nor­ity can­di­dates who must file an ap­pli­ca­tion to show they are “Malay enough” or “In­dian enough” to qual­ify for an elec­tion, she said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese can­di­dates like her­self are not re­quired to prove they are Chi­nese to stand in elec­tions, she added.</p>
    <p>HDB ETH­NIC QUO­TAS</p>
    <p>The HDB’s EIP was in­tro­duced in 1989 to pre­vent eth­nic en­claves, Ms Lim said.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the no­ble in­ten­tions, the EIP has caused eco­nomic hard­ship as res­i­dents from mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties can buy from or sell to only other mem­bers of their own com­mu­nity when quo­tas have been reached, she said.</p>
    <p>“This can sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce the num­bers of of­fers avail­able. It can also af­fect the trans­ac­tion price by as much as $100,000, in one case I came across. Such a price dif­fer­en­tial could make all the dif­fer­ence to a fam­ily in fi­nan­cial need.”</p>
    <p>She said HDB es­tates with fam­i­lies who moved in be­fore the EIP was in­tro­duced, like Be­dok, have not seen ex­tra­or­di­nary ten­sions or dis­or­der de­spite some ar­eas where the Malay pop­u­la­tion has ex­ceeded the EIP quo­tas.</p>
    <p>This sug­gests some re­lax­ation of the pol­icy could be pos­si­ble, she added.</p>
    <p>This can sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce the num­bers of of­fers avail­able. It can also af­fect the trans­ac­tion price by as much as $100,000, in one case I came across. Such a price dif­fer­en­tial could make all the dif­fer­ence to a fam­ily in fi­nan­cial need. ’’ MS SYLVIA LIM , on how the HDB’s Eth­nic In­te­gra­tion Pol­icy has caused eco­nomic hard­ship. Res­i­dents from mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties can buy from or sell to only other mem­bers of their own com­mu­nity when quo­tas have been reached, she said.</p>
    <p>AVOID RE­IN­FORC­ING TRIBAL IN­STINCTS</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said Sin­ga­pore­ans have risen above trib­al­ism on many oc­ca­sions, but the coun­try can go fur­ther with the right poli­cies and sig­nals from of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion of how not to re­in­force tribal in­stincts in pub­lic poli­cies and sur­veys should be re­viewed, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim noted en­cour­ag­ing signs from the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, in which sev­eral po­lit­i­cal par­ties fielded GRC teams with a ma­jor­ity of non-Chi­nese can­di­dates and polled well.</p>
    <p>She thanked Alju­nied GRC vot­ers for re-elect­ing her team which in­cluded three mi­nor­ity can­di­dates out of five mem­bers – Mr Pri­tam Singh, Mr Leon Per­era and Mr Faisal Manap.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve Sin­ga­porean vot­ers are not fix­ated with race, and there is cause for op­ti­mism for the fu­ture.”</p>
