    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ice Skat­ing As­so­ci­a­tion has thanked for­mer na­tional fig­ure skater Yu Shuran for speak­ing out about be­ing abused when she trained in China. Both it and Sport Sin­ga­pore said they were dis­mayed to learn of her or­deal, and the lat­ter stressed it con­tin­ues to im­prove poli­cies and mea­sures for ath­letes’ safety.</p>
    <p>Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) and the Sin­ga­pore Ice Skat­ing As­so­ci­a­tion (Sisa) are “dis­mayed” to learn of the abuse suf­fered by for­mer na­tional fig­ure skater Yu Shuran while she was train­ing in China.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for the na­tional sports agency said yes­ter­day: “The well-be­ing of all ath­letes is paramount to the le­git­i­macy of sport. (Yu) has reached out to Sisa’s safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer and the Safe Sport Task­force, and we are sup­port­ing her as nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old Yu, who was born and raised in Bei­jing to a Chi­nese mother and Sin­ga­porean father, on Wed­nes­day opened up about the abuse she suf­fered while train­ing in China, re­veal­ing in an Instagram post that the phys­i­cal abuse started when she was 11.</p>
    <p>The abuse in­flicted by her per­sonal coach, who was ap­pointed by her par­ents, in­cluded her be­ing hit re­peat­edly with a plas­tic blade guard till her skin was raw and get­ting kicked by the toe-pick of her coach’s blade – the small, jagged edges at the front of the blade.</p>
    <p>Once, dur­ing an over­seas train­ing camp, she was driven to a se­cluded area and dragged out of the car for a beat­ing as pun­ish­ment for a bad prac­tice ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Since go­ing pub­lic with her ac­count, she has re­ceived ral­ly­ing mes­sages and her father, who did not know of the abuse, has also been sup­port­ive.</p>
    <p>The SportSG spokesman said: “Safe sport poli­cies and mea­sures con­tinue to be en­hanced for sport in Sin­ga­pore. To date, nearly 100 safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers have been trained and a num­ber of safe sport en­gage­ments for the sport­ing com­mu­nity on how we may col­lec­tively safe­guard sport have been staged.</p>
    <p>“All ef­forts are taken to en­sure ev­ery­one in the fra­ter­nity – ath­letes, coaches and of­fi­cials, un­der­stand how cru­cial safe sport is and are aware of the due re­port­ing process for ath­letes to ei­ther a safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer or di­rectly to the Safe Sport Task­force.</p>
    <p>“These ef­forts must con­tinue un­abated. Our na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions (NSAs) do keep our over­seas­based ath­letes in­formed and up­dated on the sup­port chan­nels in place for them.”</p>
    <p>Sisa, which gov­erns the sport here, thanked Yu for reach­ing out.</p>
    <p>“We ap­plaud her courage to be able to speak about her ex­pe­ri­ence with be­ing abused by her pri­vate coach in the hope that it will help oth­ers in a sim­i­lar po­si­tion,” said Sisa pres­i­dent Ali­son Chan yes­ter­day, adding that the NSA is in touch with the 2017 SEA Games cham­pion and sup­port­ing her.</p>
    <p>She noted that Sisa is in reg­u­lar con­tact with its over­seas-based ath­letes, who could be at greater risk of abuse if they are train­ing in an un­fa­mil­iar en­vi­ron­ment, and Yu’s rev­e­la­tion is “a timely re­minder... to con­stantly check in on their well-be­ing on top of their sport­ing progress”.</p>
    <p>Mark Chay, chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil’s Ath­letes’ Com­mis­sion, said if an ath­lete reaches out to them with such an is­sue, it would first con­tact the Safe Sport Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“She’s al­ready in touch with Safe Sport and we’ll step in if there’s a need to, such as if there are any mis­un­der­stand­ings or com­mu­ni­ca­tion is­sues,” added Chay, who was shocked and sad to hear of Yu’s al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Yu, the first Sin­ga­porean to qual­ify for the In­ter­na­tional Skat­ing Union World Fig­ure Skat­ing Cham­pi­onships in 2017, told ST on Thurs­day that she spoke to both or­gan­i­sa­tions last week.</p>
    <p>The Safe Sport Com­mis­sion, which was launched last year to tackle ha­rass­ment and mis­con­duct against ath­letes, was set up by SportSG in part­ner­ship with the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing never lived or trained ex­ten­sively here, Yu, who is now a stu­dent at Ford­ham Univer­sity in New York, stressed that she is in no po­si­tion to com­ment on whether ath­lete abuse is an is­sue in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But she told ST: “If it is an is­sue in Sin­ga­pore, I re­ally hope that peo­ple can talk about it and that peo­ple feel that they can reach out to the Safe Sport Task­force, and that they can, in a safe way, leave their toxic en­vi­ron­ment... with­out los­ing all of their hard work.</p>
    <p>“And I think I would be thrilled if more peo­ple were able to speak up.</p>
    <p>“I was si­lent for a long time and right now, I don’t in­tend on be­ing any­thing but loud about this, be­cause if I’m not loud about it... this is­sue over­all will still be ig­nored.”</p>
    <p>SPORTS­MEN COME FIRST</p>
    <p>The well-be­ing of all ath­letes is paramount to the le­git­i­macy of sport. ’’</p>
