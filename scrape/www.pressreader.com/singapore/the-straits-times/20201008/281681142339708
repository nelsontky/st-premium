    <p>The res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate rose by 0.4 per­cent­age points in the month of Au­gust to 4.5 per cent, said a Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) report yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It has been climb­ing steadily, ris­ing 0.3 per­cent­age points in July, when the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate was 4.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>The monthly un­em­ploy­ment rates have so far gen­er­ally re­mained lower than past re­ces­sion­ary highs, added MOM.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) out­break in 2003, the rate was 6.2 per cent in Septem­ber. It was 4.9 per cent dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in Septem­ber 2009, noted the report.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said at a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day: “We can­not tell, at this point in time, whether in the com­ing months, the un­em­ploy­ment rate will uptick at a faster rate or stay around the same.</p>
    <p>“But nonethe­less, we’re keep­ing a very close watch and when the next set of fig­ures is avail­able, we will also share them with the pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>MOM noted that the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore has es­ti­mated that the com­bined bud­gets Sin­ga­pore rolled out this year – amount­ing to $100 bil­lion – will pre­vent its econ­omy from con­tract­ing by a fur­ther 5.6 per cent of the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct this year and 4.8 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>“Our eco­nomic sup­port mea­sures will also off­set some of the rise in the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate by about 1.7 per cent this year. This could mean about 155,000 jobs saved over these two years, al­though we will still see job losses over­all,” said the report.</p>
    <p>MOM started to pro­vide a monthly up­date on the un­em­ploy­ment rate from last month.</p>
    <p>In the three months to the end of June, re­trench­ments more than dou­bled to 8,130, com­pared with the first quar­ter of the year, at 3,220.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-quar­ter re­trench­ment fig­ure was above the peak dur­ing the 2003 Sars pe­riod, but be­low other re­ces­sion­ary highs such as dur­ing the 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Asked if the un­em­ploy­ment rate could be ex­pected to go up in the</p>
    <p>com­ing months as gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies are weaned off, Mrs Teo said: “We’re watch­ing it very closely. It’s very hard to fore­tell the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“What we can do, how­ever, is to make sure that even the op­por­tu­ni­ties that are cur­rently avail­able, they con­tinue to be filled as quickly as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>She said that while the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which pro­vides wage sub­si­dies to help firms re­tain lo­cal work­ers, will even­tu­ally taper off, the Gov­ern­ment has not waited un­til it has fully ta­pered off to in­tro­duce a new pro­gramme in the form of the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive.</p>
    <p>It pro­vides wage sub­si­dies of 25 per cent of the first $5,000 of gross monthly wages for each new lo­cal hire be­low 40. This will dou­ble to 50 per cent for each new lo­cal hire aged 40 and above.</p>
    <p>To be el­i­gi­ble for the scheme, firms must in­crease the head­count of their lo­cal work­force be­tween last month and next Fe­bru­ary, com­pared with Au­gust. They must also in­crease the num­ber of lo­cal jobs that pay at least $1,400 in gross monthly wages.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said the scheme is meant to help em­ploy­ers bring for­ward hir­ing.</p>
    <p>“What we hope to achieve… is for com­pa­nies that are hes­i­tat­ing, they don’t con­tinue to hes­i­tate. And for com­pa­nies that were al­ready go­ing to hire any­way, the ad­di­tional sup­port they have got­ten from the scheme ba­si­cally al­lows them to con­sider bring­ing on board even more.”</p>
    <p>She added that there was “good in­ter­est” in the scheme, al­though time should be given to em­ploy­ers to work out their man­power plans, ad­ver­tise and se­lect can­di­dates, as the scheme started just last month.</p>
