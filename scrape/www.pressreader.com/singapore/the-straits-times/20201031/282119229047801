    <p>Editorial</p>
    <p>China Daily, China</p>
    <p>By press­ing Sri Lanka and the Maldives to be on guard against what he claimed is preda­tory lending and in­vest­ment by China, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo made clear what was meant by the “dif­fi­cult but nec­es­sary” choice they were en­cour­aged to con­sider.</p>
    <p>He pre­sented the US as a “friend and part­ner” for “trans­par­ent and sus­tain­able eco­nomic devel­op­ment” in con­trast to the “dis­crim­i­na­tory and opaque prac­tices” of China.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, it is ex­actly the trans­par­ent and sus­tain­able eco­nomic devel­op­ment they have achieved in their mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion with China that has prompted this tire­less coun­try-hop­ping ped­dler of</p>
    <p>China threats to turn his at­ten­tion to the two is­land na­tions, seek­ing to em­broil them in dis­crim­i­na­tory and opaque prac­tices aimed at ar­rest­ing China’s rise.</p>
    <p>Rather than be­ing “a bea­con” for free­dom and democ­racy, the US is re­sort­ing to cash-for-sovereignt­y of­fers in its bid to get coun­tries to make com­mon cause against China.</p>
    <p>In his lec­tur­ing to his two hosts, Mr Pom­peo sim­ply drove home the mes­sage that the US ad­min­is­tra­tion’s in­ter­est in the two coun­tries is de­ter­mined by the ex­tent to which they are will­ing to side with it against China.</p>
    <p>Yet, in its bid to re­cruit mer­ce­nar­ies to build a “coali­tion” against China, the US ad­min­is­tra­tion risks mir­ing it­self and those it has en­ticed to gather un­der its ban­ner “in the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time and with the wrong en­emy”. Coun­tries know this.</p>
