    <p>NEW YORK • No­vak Djokovic will head into the US Open starting to­day with a prime op­por­tu­nity to gain ground on the ab­sent Roger Fed­erer and Rafael Nadal in chas­ing the all-time men’s Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tle record.</p>
    <p>Holder Nadal pulled out ear­lier this month due to coro­n­avirus-re­lated is­sues sur­round­ing the Aug 31-Sept 13 tour­na­ment at Flush­ing Mead­ows, while Fed­erer will miss the rest of the sea­son af­ter hav­ing knee surgery in June.</p>
    <p>Swiss leg­end Fed­erer owns a record 20 men’s Grand Slam ti­tles with Spa­niard Nadal next on 19.</p>
    <p>But Djokovic, who is seek­ing to win his 18th, has played down the ab­sence of his two ri­vals.</p>
    <p>“It’s bound to be weird that Fed­erer and Nadal aren’t here,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They will be missed, no doubt, be­cause they are leg­ends of our sport. But, apart from Fed­erer, Nadal and (Stan) Wawrinka, all the best play­ers are there.</p>
    <p>“It would be dis­re­spect­ful to all the other play­ers to say that I have a bet­ter chance with­out Roger and Rafa. (Dominic) Thiem, (Alexander) Zverev, (Ste­fanos) Tsit­si­pas, (Daniil) Medvedev, these guys are as strong as the three of us.</p>
    <p>“Any­one can win, we don’t know how we’re go­ing to feel on court.”</p>
    <p>The world No. 1, who has won five of the past seven Grand Slams, im­proved to 23-0 this year on Saturday by de­feat­ing Canada’s Mi­los Raonic 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the ATP Western & South­ern fi­nal, also in the New York bub­ble.</p>
    <p>By do­ing so, he clinched his 80th ca­reer ti­tle and equalled Nadal’s record of 35 Masters 1000 wins.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing on an un­beaten run so far this year ob­vi­ously brings even more con­fi­dence each match,” he added.</p>
    <p>“I am try­ing to make the most of this time when I feel that I’m phys­i­cally, men­tally, emo­tion­ally at the peak and play­ing some of the best ten­nis I’ve ever played.”</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old will launch his quest for a fourth US Open ti­tle to­day at the Arthur Ashe Sta­dium against Bos­nia and Herze­gov­ina’s 107th-ranked Damir Dzumhur.</p>
    <p>The last time a player other than Djokovic, Nadal and Fed­erer won a Grand Slam men’s sin­gles ti­tle was when Swiss Wawrinka won the 2016 US Open. But a host of ris­ing young stars are now aim­ing for a break­through with Fed­erer and Nadal out.</p>
    <p>Djokovic feels that Medvedev, Zverev, Tsit­si­pas and Thiem are the clos­est chal­lengers, but they have yet to con­vert po­ten­tial into suc­cess on the big­gest stages.</p>
    <p>“It’s a big op­por­tu­nity for a new Grand Slam win­ner, be­cause there are only three Slam win­ners in the draw – (Marin) Cilic, (Andy) Mur­ray, and No­vak,” Medvedev said.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old Rus­sian ex­celled on the North Amer­i­can hard courts last year, reach­ing four fi­nals – at Flush­ing Mead­ows, Wash­ing­ton DC, Canada and Cincin­nati.</p>
    <p>He lost to Nadal in the US Open fi­nal, but won his first ATP Masters 1000 ti­tle in Cincin­nati, beat­ing Djokovic in the semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Tsit­si­pas, the win­ner of last year’s sea­son-end­ing ATP Fi­nals, is hop­ing to take ad­van­tage of hav­ing fewer dis­trac­tions with play­ers liv­ing in a pro­tec­tive bub­ble.</p>
    <p>“I won’t lie to you. It’s not that bad,” the 22-year-old Greek said.</p>
    <p>“It gives me an op­por­tu­nity to prac­tise a lot, dis­cover my­self more on the court.”</p>
    <p>Zverev, 23, a semi-fi­nal­ist at this year’s Aus­tralian Open, has added former world No. 3 David Fer­rer to his coach­ing staff in an at­tempt to fix the weak­nesses in his game.</p>
    <p>“We played (each other) eight times in our ca­reers, so he knows ex­actly what I need to im­prove,” he said.</p>
