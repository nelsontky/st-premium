    <p>•</p>
    <p>A Ja­panese man dubbed the “Twit­ter killer” has with­drawn an ap­peal against his guilty ver­dict and death sen­tence over the mur­der of nine peo­ple, a court of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Takahiro Shi­raishi, 30, sub­mit­ted the mo­tion on Mon­day to drop the ap­peal filed by his lawyers, a court spokesman told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi l ured peo­ple who posted on­line com­ments about sui­ci­dal thoughts to his home, where he killed and butchered his vic­tims.</p>
    <p>All but one of those mur­dered were women, and they ranged in age from 15 to 26.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his trial, he did not con­test the charges against him, although his lawyer at­tempted to re­duce his sen­tence, ar­gu­ing that the sui­ci­dal thoughts ex­pressed by the vic­tims in­di­cated their will­ing­ness to die.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi was de­tained three years ago as po­lice in­ves­ti­gated the dis­ap­pear­ance of a 23-year-old woman who re­port­edly tweeted about want­ing to kill her­self.</p>
    <p>Her brother gained ac­cess to her Twit­ter ac­count and this even­tu­ally led po­lice to Shi­raishi’s res­i­dence, where in­ves­ti­ga­tors found nine dis­mem­bered bod­ies stored in cool­ers and tool­boxes that had been sprin­kled with cat lit­ter in a bid to hide the ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi told the court dur­ing his trial that he had no plans to ap­peal against any rul­ing made against him, and he told a lo­cal news­pa­per the ver­dict had been ob­vi­ous.</p>
    <p>De­spite the death sen­tence, he told the Mainichi Shim­bun he wanted to now “meet an or­di­nary girl” and get mar­ried while in jail.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi’s crime reignited de­bate about sui­cide preven­tion in Ja­pan, which has the high­est sui­cide rate among the Group of Seven coun­tries. Ef­forts to re­duce sui­cide rates have led to a de­cline in re­cent years, but num­bers have been ris­ing again amid the pan­demic.</p>
