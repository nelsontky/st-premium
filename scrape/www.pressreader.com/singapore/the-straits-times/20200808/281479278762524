    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s top busi­ness cham­ber has urged em­ploy­ers to re­trench work­ers only as a last re­sort and, should they need to make the move, to en­sure that the pro­por­tion of lo­cal staff in the com­pa­nies is not eroded.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, ef­forts to build up skills among lo­cal work­ers and keep them em­ploy­able con­tinue to gather steam, with five com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment coun­cils (CDCs) jointly hold­ing a week-long event from Mon­day, of­fer­ing ac­cess to coach­ing and path­ways to jobs.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that lay­offs are ex­pected to rise in the com­ing months, the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) stressed in an ad­vi­sory to its mem­ber com­pa­nies yes­ter­day that if these be­come in­evitable, they should be done in a fair and trans­par­ent man­ner.</p>
    <p>“If com­pa­nies need to re­trench, they should have in place fair cri­te­ria that pro­tect their Sin­ga­porean core and yet re­tain tal­ent nec­es­sary for growth,” said SBF chair­man Lim Ming Yan.</p>
    <p>Warn­ing com­pa­nies against dis­crim­i­nat­ing against any group on the ba­sis of age, race, gen­der, re­li­gion, mar­i­tal sta­tus or dis­abil­ity, the SBF added: “They should re­tain em­ploy­ees, both lo­cal and for­eign, based on their key skills and ex­pe­ri­ences needed to en­able the com­pany to emerge stronger and cre­ate new job op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>It asked its mem­ber com­pa­nies to ex­plore other op­tions – such as send­ing work­ers for train­ing, re­de­ploy­ing them to other roles and im­ple­ment­ing wage ad­just­ments – be­fore re­trench­ing staff.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary fig­ures re­leased last week by the Min­istry of Man­power showed that un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ments surged be­tween April and June, while to­tal em­ploy­ment shrank in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim urged busi­nesses to take a longer-term view of their man­power needs “so as to re­tain and up­grade im­por­tant ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and to trans­form their busi­nesses for the even­tual re­cov­ery”.</p>
    <p>The SBF, which rep­re­sents more than 27,000 com­pa­nies, said many busi­nesses face in­creas­ing chal­lenges and have been hold­ing on to their work­ers for as long as they can.</p>
    <p>While gov­ern­ment sup­port mea­sures have helped stave off re­trench­ment in the first half of the year, those in hard-hit sec­tors may have to make tough man­power decisions to sur­vive, it added.</p>
    <p>The ad­vi­sory is in line with the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Fair Re­trench­ment Frame­work, which pro­motes re­spon­si­ble prac­tices for firms lay­ing off staff, and the Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Man­ag­ing Ex­cess Man­power and Re­spon­si­ble Re­trench­ment, which en­cour­ages firms to no­tify work­ers early and ex­plain why lay­offs are needed.</p>
    <p>In a Facebook post yes­ter­day, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing ac­knowl­edged the greater pres­sure busi­nesses and work­ers are feeling on the ground.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan noted that the SBF ad­vi­sory re­minds busi­nesses the crit­i­cal role they play amid an un­cer­tain eco­nomic out­look.</p>
    <p>“I hope that this re­minder will al­low our com­pa­nies to more care­fully con­sider their op­tions be­fore turn­ing to re­trench­ment as a last re­sort, and when there is no other op­tion but to re­trench, re­mem­ber to do so in a fair and rea­son­able man­ner,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the event or­gan­ised by the five CDCs of­fers pro­fes­sional ad­vice to res­i­dents on new skills they can pick up which may come in handy dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>It will host over 50 on­line work­shops, we­bi­nars and mas­ter­classes and make avail­able a web­site of­fer­ing ac­cess to var­i­ous job search plat­forms with over 10,000 va­can­cies.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times’ re­port on the watch list of busi­nesses ex­hibit­ing dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing high­lights some firms’ lack of aware­ness with re­gard to lo­cal job seek­ers (Some firms on watch list didn’t cast net wide enough for lo­cals, Aug 6).</p>
    <p>I would say the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices sim­i­larly does not look deep enough into the is­sue of for­eign­ers dis­plac­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans in the job mar­ket for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs).</p>
    <p>The fact that a num­ber of the com­pa­nies on the watch list had for­eign­ers com­pris­ing more than half of their PMET work­force is dis­turb­ing.</p>
    <p>A su­per­fi­cial look at the com­pany’s pro­por­tion of for­eign­ers hold­ing all of its PMET jobs does not give the whole pic­ture.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a com­pany may have for­eign­ers tak­ing up 20 per cent of its to­tal PMET jobs, but the pro­por­tion of for­eign­ers in its in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy depart­ment may be 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>Un­like some cat­e­gories of jobs that are shunned and which are mostly taken up by work per­mit hold­ers, PMET jobs are de­sired by Sin­ga­pore­ans and many are able to fill these posts.</p>
    <p>In­stead of set­ting quo­tas for PMET jobs, Sin­ga­pore­ans should al­ways come first un­less the em­ployer is un­able to find Sin­ga­pore­ans with suf­fi­cient ex­pe­ri­ence and/or knowl­edge. There are not many sec­tors in which Sin­ga­pore­ans are not ca­pa­ble of fill­ing po­si­tions.</p>
