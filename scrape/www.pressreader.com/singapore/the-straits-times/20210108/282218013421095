    <p>Sil­i­con Val­ley-based Im­pos­si­ble Foods will lower its in­ter­na­tional prices by dou­ble dig­its for dis­trib­u­tors in Sin­ga­pore, Canada, Hong Kong and Ma­cau.</p>
    <p>The price cuts, which vary by lo­ca­tion and take ef­fect this month, ap­ply to all Im­pos­si­ble food ser­vice prod­ucts sold over­seas, said the plant-based burger maker in a state­ment late on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>In the United States, the group is also low­er­ing prices by around 15 per cent on its open-coded food ser­vice prod­ucts, mark­ing its sec­ond do­mes­tic price cut since March last year.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes the quar­ter-pound and third-pound Im­pos­si­ble Burger pat­ties, the five-pound Im­pos­si­ble Burger bulk pack­ages and Im­pos­si­ble Sausage Made From Plants pat­ties.</p>
    <p>The price cuts come amid record global de­mand for Im­pos­si­ble Burger, said the group.</p>
    <p>Im­pos­si­ble Sausage, launched a year ago, was made avail­able in more than 20,000 lo­ca­tions across the US within six months.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion has in­creased six­fold since 2019, both at the group’s man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­ity in Oak­land, Cal­i­for­nia, and at mul­ti­ple plants owned by the firm’s co-man­u­fac­tur­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>Mr Patrick Brown, Im­pos­si­ble Foods chief ex­ec­u­tive and founder, said: “Less than a year ago, we cut food ser­vice prices by 15 per cent. To­day’s price cut is just the lat­est – not the last – step to­wards mak­ing the food sys­tem sus­tain­able.”</p>
    <p>The group fur­ther noted that its growth has en­abled it to achieve economies of scale and, there­fore, cost sav­ings that it plans to con­tinue pass­ing along to busi­ness own­ers and con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Im­pos­si­ble Foods pres­i­dent Den­nis Wood­side said: “While we couldn’t and wouldn’t de­ter­mine pric­ing for in­de­pen­dent third par­ties, we sin­cerely hope our food dis­trib­u­tor col­leagues pass along this price cut to hard­work­ing restau­ra­teurs and their cus­tomers in this un­prece­dented time of need.”</p>
