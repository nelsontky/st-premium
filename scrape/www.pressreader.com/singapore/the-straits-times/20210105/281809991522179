    <p>LONDON • A Bri­tish judge has ruled that Wik­iLeaks founder Ju­lian As­sange should not be ex­tra­dited to the United States to face es­pi­onage charges for pub­lish­ing hun­dreds of thou­sands of se­cret doc­u­ments on­line.</p>
    <p>District Judge Vanessa Baraitser yes­ter­day said the 49-year-old Aus­tralian pub­lisher was a sui­cide risk if he was sent into US cus­tody.</p>
    <p>“For this rea­son I have de­cided ex­tra­di­tion would be op­pres­sive by rea­son of men­tal harm and I or­der his dis­charge,” she added.</p>
    <p>In court, As­sange wiped his fore­head as the de­ci­sion was an­nounced while his fi­ancee Stella Moris burst into tears and was em­braced by Wik­iLeaks ed­i­tor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafns­son. Out­side the Old Bai­ley court in London, his sup­port­ers erupted in cheers and shouted: “Free As­sange!”</p>
    <p>As­sange and his le­gal team have long ar­gued that the pro­tracted case, which has be­come a cause cele­bre for me­dia free­dom, was po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>As­sange faced 18 charges in the US re­lat­ing to the 2010 re­lease by Wik­iLeaks of 500,000 se­cret files de­tail­ing as­pects of mil­i­tary cam­paigns in Afghanista­n and Iraq. If con­victed in the US, As­sange faced up to 175 years in jail.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Swe­den first is­sued an ar­rest war­rant for As­sange in 2010 over al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual as­sault, he sought asy­lum in Ecuador’s em­bassy in London, where he re­mained from 2012 un­til 2019 when Ecuador re­voked his cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain ar­rested him for breach­ing his bail terms but he re­mained in cus­tody pend­ing the rul­ing on the ex­tra­di­tion re­quest. The Swedish as­sault case was later dropped due to lack of ev­i­dence.</p>
