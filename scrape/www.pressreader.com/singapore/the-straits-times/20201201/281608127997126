    <p>One Cham­pi­onship’s Big Bang event at the In­door Sta­dium will pro­ceed as sched­uled on Fri­day night de­spite a cor­ner­man of one of the ath­letes test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the mixed mar­tial arts or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment, they said the cor­ner­man, who had tested neg­a­tive be­fore his de­par­ture from Be­larus, had tested pos­i­tive on ar­rival here last Fri­day. He was taken to a hos­pi­tal and is cur­rently un­der­go­ing treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“As part of the strin­gent pro­to­cols for for­eign ath­letes and crew tak­ing part in this event, he was placed in iso­la­tion since ar­rival,” said the state­ment. “Three other in­di­vid­u­als par­tic­i­pat­ing in the event, who were on the same flight as the cor­ner­man, are cur­rently serv­ing their quar­an­tine in a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity.”</p>
    <p>In com­bat sport, cor­ner­men can be train­ers, coaches, cut­men or train­ing part­ners, and of­ten spend a lot of time in close prox­im­ity to their fight­ers.</p>
    <p>Pro­to­cols for the up­com­ing live event, which can have up to 250 fans in at­ten­dance, in­clude the re­quire­ment for all for­eign-based ath­letes, cor­ner­men and staff to be iso­lated un­til they re­ceive a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test re­sult, af­ter which they will fol­low a strictly con­trolled itin­er­ary that has been pre-ap­proved.</p>
    <p>For­eign-based ath­letes and One Cham­pi­onship’s pro­duc­tion crew</p>
    <p>are also re­quired to be tested four times – be­fore they leave their coun­try, on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, as well as be­fore and af­ter their fights.</p>
    <p>“Pub­lic health and safety re­main our top pri­or­ity,” said One Cham­pi­onship and STB. “This case was de­tected through the screen­ing pro­to­cols and strin­gent mea­sures that were put in place to safe­guard the health of our lo­cal com­mu­nity as well as the ath­letes and pro­duc­tion crew.”</p>
    <p>There were two pos­i­tive cases de­tected ahead of One Cham­pi­onship’s In­side the Ma­trix event on Oct 30, which was the first live sports event here since the pan­demic to fea­ture spec­ta­tors. It wel­comed 250 fans.</p>
    <p>The two cases, in­volv­ing cor­ner­men from the United States and Rus­sia, were de­ter­mined to be past in­fec­tions af­ter sero­log­i­cal tests were con­ducted. On the night of the In­side The Ma­trix show, STB and One Cham­pi­onship an­nounced the pair had re­cov­ered but were kept out of the event as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Big Bang will be One Cham­pi­onship’s third event here since the out­break. The first was on Oct 9 be­hind closed doors be­fore In­side The Ma­trix. A fourth show, Col­li­sion Course, has been sched­uled for Dec 18.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous in­ter­na­tional sport­ing events have gone on de­spite pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus tests among ath­letes or of­fi­cials, or have been man­aged through iso­la­tion. Most no­tably, the English Premier League con­ducts test­ing rou­tinely and an­nounces the test rate as well as num­ber of pos­i­tive re­sults, with­out nam­ing the play­ers or clubs in­volved. Those who test pos­i­tive will self-iso­late for 10 days while games are played as sched­uled.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) com­pleted its 2019-20 reg­u­lar sea­son and play­offs in Oc­to­ber in­side a se­cure “bub­ble” at Dis­ney World in Or­lando, Florida, with play­ers tested daily and re­quired to quar­an­tine for 48 hours af­ter they ar­rived, or un­til they re­turned two neg­a­tive Covid-19 tests at least 24 hours apart.</p>
    <p>As part of the strin­gent pro­to­cols for for­eign ath­letes and crew tak­ing part in this event, he was placed in iso­la­tion since ar­rival... Three other in­di­vid­u­als par­tic­i­pat­ing in the event, who were on the same flight as the cor­ner­man, are cur­rently serv­ing their quar­an­tine in a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity.</p>
