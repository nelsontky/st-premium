    <p>Malaysia recorded yes­ter­day its high­est daily in­crease in new Covid-19 cases since the out­break be­gan, as the coun­try’s politi­cians were lam­basted on­line for fail­ing to prac­tise so­cial dis­tanc­ing when cam­paign­ing in Sabah’s re­cent state elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens also crit­i­cised them for fail­ing to self-quar­an­tine when they re­turned to penin­su­lar Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said Malaysia recorded 287 cases yes­ter­day, eclips­ing the 277 cases re­ported on</p>
    <p>June 4. “This is what we have been wor­ried about; this is keep­ing up with the trend we are see­ing of Covid-19 cases ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a spike all over the world,” the min­istry’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah said at a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The new peak seems closely linked with the move­ment of thou­sands of in­di­vid­u­als re­turn­ing from the hotly con­tested Sabah elec­tion held on Sept 26. Many Saba­hans, who work in penin­su­lar Malaysia, had gone home to vote.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral politi­cians who had vis­ited and cam­paigned in Sabah have al­ready tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>In the past week, Malaysia had con­sis­tently reg­is­tered three-digit</p>
    <p>daily cases. And since polling day, the au­thor­i­ties have an­nounced mea­sures to curb the surge in in­fec­tions, be­gin­ning with manda­tory Covid-19 screen­ings for all who re­turned from Sabah since Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Sabah will also face a 14-day move­ment con­trol or­der that bans travel among the 27 dis­tricts af­ter mid­night tonight. Only es­sen­tial ser­vices and travel are al­lowed.</p>
    <p>A tar­geted lock­down had been in­tro­duced ear­lier this week in four virus hot-spot dis­tricts in the east coast of Sabah.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, #klus­ter­menteri (min­is­ters’ clus­ter) trended on Twit­ter fol­low­ing re­ports of Cab­i­net min­is­ters and se­nior politi­cians not prac­tis­ing self-quar­an­tine on re­turn from Sabah.</p>
    <p>Among those who re­ceived flak was Mr Az­man Nas­rudin, a state ex­ec­u­tive coun­cil­lor in Kedah who is a mem­ber of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Ber­satu party, who tested pos­i­tive. He did not self-quar­an­tine be­fore his pos­i­tive re­sult.</p>
    <p>His wife, a school teacher, also tested pos­i­tive, caus­ing her en­tire school to un­dergo swab tests.</p>
    <p>The Higher Education Min­istry also came un­der fire af­ter it asked all first-year univer­sity stu­dents in Malaysia to de­lay reg­is­ter­ing in per­son be­cause of the spike.</p>
    <p>The un­der­grad­u­ates got the in­struc­tion af­ter they had paid for their ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“Love how I’ve packed and packed, ready to fi­nally start my long-awaited de­gree, just for me to un­pack ev­ery­thing back. Also lost RM400 of my par­ents’ hos­tel pay­ment. Thanks, min­is­ters,” Twit­ter user Lydia Chai posted.</p>
    <p>Mr Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, the chief of Barisan Na­sional (BN) – the big­gest fac­tion in the rul­ing fed­eral gov­ern­ment – apol­o­gised for the spike and ad­mit­ted it was di­rectly caused by the Sabah polls.</p>
    <p>Cases in Sabah be­gan to spike early last month and by polling day the state had recorded 85 per cent of all cases in Malaysia over a twoweek pe­riod.</p>
    <p>While Sabah re­mains a hot spot with 113 cases yes­ter­day, a new clus­ter has emerged in Kedah, with 129 cases.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the spike in cases has damp­ened talk of a pos­si­ble snap elec­tion in Malaysia that Tan Sri Muhyid­din had al­luded to ear­lier. BN sec­re­tary gen­eral An­nuar Musa yes­ter­day said an elec­tion should not be held in the near fu­ture.</p>
