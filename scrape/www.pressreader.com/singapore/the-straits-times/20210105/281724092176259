    <p>Peo­ple who choose not to get the Covid-19 vac­cine will not need to have a change of du­ties at their work­places, un­less there is a resur­gence in the num­ber of lo­cal cases, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), who had asked if those who are not vac­ci­nated will have their job scopes re­viewed in or­der to re­duce ex­po­sure to the virus.</p>
    <p>All work­ers should con­tinue to take nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions such as wear­ing masks, and where re­quired, don per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing, Mr Gan added.</p>
    <p>He noted that there are cer­tain groups of em­ploy­ees, such as re­searchers or lab­o­ra­tory staff, who may be work­ing di­rectly on the Covid-19 virus or face high risk of ex­po­sure to in­fected in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) and Min­istry of Man­power are re­view­ing the is­sue of vac­ci­nat­ing work­ers in such work­place set­tings and will pro­vide fur­ther ad­vice later, he said.</p>
    <p>In his min­is­te­rial state­ment on Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to the pan­demic, Mr Gan said MOH will also in­tro­duce a vac­cine in­jury fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>This scheme will sup­port those who suf­fer a se­ri­ous ad­verse event that is as­sessed to be re­lated to Covid-19 vac­cines ad­min­is­tered in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“While we ex­pect few to need this, the pro­gramme will give peace of mind to those tak­ing the vac­ci­na­tion,” he said. “Fur­ther de­tails on the pro­gramme will be pro­vided in due course.”</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity and an in­de­pen­dent ex­pert com­mit­tee ap­pointed by his min­istry have stud­ied the data on po­ten­tial side ef­fects caused by the Covid-19 vac­cine. The data in­cludes in­for­ma­tion from clin­i­cal tri­als as well as the ac­tual ex­pe­ri­ence of coun­tries where vac­ci­na­tion ef­forts are un­der way.</p>
    <p>“They have fac­tored this into their eval­u­a­tion be­fore grant­ing au­tho­ri­sa­tion or mak­ing a rec­om­men­da­tion on the use of Covid-19 vac­cines,” he said.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who get the Pfizer-BioN­Tech vac­cine may ex­pe­ri­ence side ef­fects such as pain at the in­jec­tion site, fa­tigue, fever, mus­cle aches or headaches.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have rec­om­mended that those with known se­vere al­ler­gies should not be vac­ci­nated. Peo­ple will also be ob­served on site for 30 min­utes post-vac­ci­na­tion, so that any se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions, such as ana­phy­laxis, can be de­tected and treated promptly.</p>
