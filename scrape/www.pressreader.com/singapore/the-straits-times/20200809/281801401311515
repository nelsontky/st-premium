    <p>While the Covid-19 pan­demic has af­fected mil­lions around the world, Sin­ga­pore­ans have re­sponded to it with unity, for­ti­tude and re­silience, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yesterday.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one has played a part, mak­ing sac­ri­fices and ad­just­ments as the sit­u­a­tion evolves,” he said at the Be­dok Na­tional Day vir­tual ob­ser­vance cer­e­mony, his first as the new MP for the ward in East Coast GRC since he moved to an­chor it at last month’s gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance, held up health­care and front-line work­ers for their ded­i­ca­tion to duty.</p>
    <p>He also high­lighted ef­forts by the com­mu­nity, such as se­niors learn­ing how to go dig­i­tal, busi­ness own­ers who have taken SafeEn­try and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures se­ri­ously, and res­i­dents who have been ex­er­cis­ing per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity such as wear­ing masks when go­ing out.</p>
    <p>“With our ef­forts to­gether, we have man­aged to keep com­mu­nity cases to the sin­gle digit in the past weeks. But we must con­tinue to stay vig­i­lant and keep to the safe man­age­ment mea­sures, to avoid a new wave of in­fec­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The road ahead is go­ing to be dif­fi­cult,” he added, say­ing the Gov­ern­ment has com­mit­ted close to $100 bil­lion to fight the cri­sis, with jobs a top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, speak­ing from Be­dok Com­mu­nity Cen­tre, was joined by his fel­low MPs in the GRC: Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice (PMO) Ma­liki Os­man, Min­is­ter of State in the PMO and for Na­tional Devel­op­ment Tan Kiat How, and back­benchers Ch­eryl Chan and Jes­sica Tan.</p>
    <p>As part of the Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions, all five will em­bark on the East Coast Trail this Satur­day, Mr Heng said. “East Coast is a very big and di­verse area, all the way from Be­dok Town Cen­tre to Pu­lau Ubin, and even to Pe­dra Branca. So we are ex­plor­ing many in­ter­est­ing sites and fea­tures in the East Coast,” he added, invit­ing res­i­dents to join them on the East Coast Buzz Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Former MPs Lim Swee Say and Lee Yi Shyan also made guest ap­pear­ances at the ses­sion that was at­tended by res­i­dents from over 500 Be­dok house­holds via Zoom and streamed live on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng thanked East Coast GRC res­i­dents for their trust and sup­port in the GE, when the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party team won with 53.39 per cent of the vote. “We are de­ter­mined to serve you bet­ter and to de­liver on the man­date that you have given us.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Marine Pa­rade GRC and Mount­bat­ten and MacPher­son SMCs held a com­bined vir­tual Na­tional Day event yesterday.</p>
    <p>Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin, who heads the Marine Pa­rade GRC team, said Covid-19 has af­fected lives and taken away jobs, but Sin­ga­pore can emerge stronger.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment will do all it can to help you. The com­mu­nity will also do what it can to stand to­gether with you... We need to do this to­gether,” he said. “That’s what be­ing Sin­ga­pore is all about. It’s not just a con­cept and a no­tion, but it’s about re­la­tion­ships... be­tween all the dif­fer­ent en­ti­ties that add up to and make up what we call home.”</p>
    <p>Last night, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob also joined the Sin­ga­pore Fed­er­a­tion of Chi­nese Clan As­so­ci­a­tions’ vir­tual 14th Na­tional Day Sin­ga­long. Madam Hal­imah ac­knowl­edged the work of the na­tion’s front­line work­ers dur­ing this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Thank you for your self­less con­tri­bu­tions to keep all of us safe dur­ing this pe­riod. This is a tes­ta­ment to our re­silience and SGUnited spirit,” she said. “As we cel­e­brate our 55th Na­tional Day, let us stand in sol­i­dar­ity with one an­other to over­come the chal­lenges ahead.”</p>
