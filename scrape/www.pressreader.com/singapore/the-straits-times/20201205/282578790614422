    <p>The WTA is plan­ning to start the 2021 sea­son in the first week of Jan­uary out­side Aus­tralia be­fore the play­ers travel to Mel­bourne for quar­an­tine ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year, women’s Tour chief Steve Si­mon re­vealed.</p>
    <p>“We’re... hope­fully close to fi­nal­is­ing in the next week or so the abil­ity to stage some events in the week of Jan 4 to start the year,” he said.</p>
    <p>He did not pro­vide de­tails of where the Tour might start, but nor­mally both the WTA and the men’s ATP Tours kick off their sea­sons in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, t he WTA had events in Bris­bane, Shen­zhen and Auck­land start­ing on Jan 6. But, with strict health mea­sures in place for in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals to curb the risk of im­ported Covid-19 cases, nei­ther China nor New Zealand will likely fea­ture next month.</p>
    <p>Both the WTA and the ATP are ex­pected to con­firm their 2021 cal­en­dars once the de­tails of the Aus­tralian Open are ap­proved by the local au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Open looks likely to be pushed back from its sched­uled Jan 18 start as Ten­nis Aus­tralia (TA) con­tin­ues talks with the local gov­ern­ment over Covid-19 pro­to­cols to be es­tab­lished for Mel­bourne Park.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions over when the play­ers will ar­rive in Aus­tralia and what they will be al­lowed to do dur­ing their 14 days of quar­an­tine have dragged out over the last few weeks but Si­mon is con­fi­dent the tour­na­ment would go ahead.</p>
    <p>“The Aus­tralian Open, we’re ex­pect­ing it to hap­pen,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, the Aus­tralian Open will come with a quar­an­tine pe­riod to en­ter Aus­tralia so it does cre­ate chal­lenges around the month of Jan­uary.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the quar­an­tine pe­riod, the WTA has planned tuneup tour­na­ments and hopes to re­turn to its tra­di­tional cal­en­dar as closely as pos­si­ble. The cir­cuit is work­ing with its mem­bers and TA to firm up plans, Si­mon added.</p>
    <p>“We’re again get­ting to a good place and we’ll be able to start the year, and then tran­si­tion into Aus­tralia and then have a great year,” he said.</p>
