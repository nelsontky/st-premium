    <p>Three knee op­er­a­tions – two due to a torn an­te­rior cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment and the other, a torn menis­cus – be­fore the age of 21 dashed Mr Ter­ence Ong’s (be­low) dreams of be­com­ing a pro­fes­sional foot­baller. He later pur­sued foot­ball freestylin­g and helped set up an academy to teach soc­cer to chil­dren.</p>
    <p>What is your se­cret to look­ing fab­u­lous?</p>
    <p>It is the con­sis­tency of work­ing out and main­tain­ing a healthy diet.</p>
    <p>I plan work­outs ac­cord­ing to my busy sched­ule. If I know I have some­thing on at a spe­cific time, I will work around it and make sure I do my work­outs be­fore or after it.</p>
    <p>I also watch what I eat by get­ting a good bal­ance of nu­tri­ents.</p>
    <p>Of course, no one is per­fect and there will be days when I miss a train­ing ses­sion, be it run­ning or go­ing to the gym.</p>
    <p>I may also have to eat out and not get my de­sired meals, but I do my best to keep to my train­ing and diet sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Has there ever been a time when you were not fit and fab? Def­i­nitely. It has al­ways been an on­go­ing bat­tle. I will start for a while with a good train­ing sched­ule and eat­ing habits, and after some time, I fall back.</p>
    <p>But this is my life­style now and I am never go­ing back to what I was be­fore.</p>
    <p>What is your diet like?</p>
    <p>When I was try­ing to lose all the ex­tra weight, I was very strict with my­self. I made sure I ate fewer calo­ries than what my body needed.</p>
    <p>I switched car­bo­hy­drate sources, ate more pro­tein and avoided eat­ing meals out­side at least 95 per cent of the time.</p>
    <p>When I got into the shape I wanted, it was much eas­ier. I un­der­stood my body a lot more and I could eat out­side and still main­tain my calo­rie in­take.</p>
    <p>What do you in­dulge in?</p>
    <p>From burg­ers to pasta to cakes to choco­lates, any­thing you feed a 12-year-old kid, I will eat.</p>
    <p>How do you main­tain a healthy work-life bal­ance?</p>
    <p>I think plan­ning is im­por­tant, as the adage goes: If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.</p>
    <p>What are the three most im­por­tant things in your life?</p>
    <p>My fam­ily, my job – I run the Sport­ing CP Soc­cer Academy – and my health and fit­ness.</p>
    <p>What’s your favourite and least favourite part of your body?</p>
    <p>I hon­estly do not have a favourite or least favourite. I am pretty blessed to be pro­por­tion­ate all round.</p>
    <p>What are your must-dos be­fore and after a work­out?</p>
    <p>I usu­ally run in a “fasted” state (on an empty stom­ach) and make sure I eat well after weight train­ing.</p>
    <p>How im­por­tant is it for you to keep up with your fit­ness rou­tine? Very im­por­tant. I am never go­ing back to my heav­i­est at 80kg. I was fat and slug­gish. I also want to be a role model for the kids in my soc­cer academy.</p>
    <p>How are you keep­ing fit dur­ing this pe­riod?</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, I went for runs and worked out at home.</p>
    <p>Now that re­stric­tions have been eased, I have more op­tions with the ac­tiv­i­ties I want to do, such as muay thai and foot­ball fit­ness train­ing.</p>
    <p>What are the changes you have made to keep ex­er­cis­ing dur­ing this time?</p>
    <p>It was easy. I switched my car­dio ac­tiv­i­ties around. So if I can’t go to the muay thai gym or kick a ball, I will go for a run.</p>
    <p>How has your ac­tive life­style in­flu­enced your fam­ily and friends?</p>
    <p>My two younger broth­ers are also into health and fit­ness. My par­ents are def­i­nitely more con­scious about their diet and ac­tiv­ity lev­els.</p>
    <p>As for my friends, I be­lieve I have in­flu­enced some to change their life­style and diet for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>What’s the most ex­treme thing you have done in the name of fit­ness?</p>
    <p>Drink­ing eight litres of wa­ter one night be­fore I slept to get ready for a fit­ness photo shoot the next day.</p>
    <p>To look leaner, I took a friend’s ad­vice to drink a lot of wa­ter the night be­fore and take only sips the next day.</p>
    <p>How ex­ten­sive is your col­lec­tion of sports-re­lated para­pher­na­lia? I own enough at home to have a great work­out. My equip­ment in­cludes bar­bells with weights up to 50kg, dumb­bells up to 20kg, re­sis­tance bands and a weight vest.</p>
    <p>Would you go for plas­tic surgery?</p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p>Do you think you’re sexy? On some days.</p>
