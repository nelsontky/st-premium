    <p>Prominent busi­ness­man and com­mu­nity leader Ameer­ali R. Jum­ab­hoy died yes­ter­day at the age of 94.</p>
    <p>Mr Jum­ab­hoy founded Scotts Hold­ings Lim­ited in 1982, the com­pany be­hind Scotts Shop­ping Cen­tre and the As­cott ser­viced res­i­dences.</p>
    <p>“He was a vi­sion­ary and a pi­o­neer, al­ways will­ing to chal­lenge the sta­tus quo, and a lov­ing hus­band, fa­ther, grand­fa­ther and great-grand­fa­ther,” said his fam­ily in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Jum­ab­hoy was born on Dec 28, 1925, the el­dest of four sur­viv­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther, Mr Ra­ja­bali Jum­ab­hoy, whose nick­name was “the Grand Old Man of Scotts”, was a prominent busi­ness­man and key fig­ure in Sin­ga­pore’s In­dian com­mu­nity who ran in the 1955 Gen­eral Elec­tion as an in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>The younger Jum­ab­hoy, known to friends and fam­ily as Ameer, built Scotts Shop­ping Cen­tre, whose Pic­nic food­court a gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans would re­mem­ber fondly as one of the first, if not the first, air-con­di­tioned food­courts in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Un­der his lead­er­ship, the Jum­ab­hoy fam­ily moved into other busi­ness ven­tures, in­clud­ing the A&W fast-food chain and duty-free oper­a­tions at Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>At its peak, Scotts had as­sets val­ued at over $600 mil­lion. In 1996, amid a fam­ily feud, Scotts Hold­ings was sold to Cap­i­taLand.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily also bought and con­cep­tu­alised the re­de­vel­op­ment of Lau Pa Sat.</p>
    <p>Last year, he was awarded the Life­time Achieve­ment Award by the Sin­ga­pore In­dian Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try (SICCI).</p>
    <p>“He was such a won­der­ful man – cheer­ful and friendly and he did not put on any airs,” the SICCI chair­man, Dr T. Chandroo, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Chandroo said Mr Jum­ab­hoy was a good friend and men­tor to him­self and the SICCI.</p>
    <p>“He al­ways showed up (for events) de­spite his age, and loved to mo­ti­vate the young and en­cour­age them to take up chal­lenges,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Jum­ab­hoy was a keen sports­man and in­stru­men­tal in se­cur­ing the land where the cur­rent Sin­ga­pore Polo Club is lo­cated, said his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>He was the first Sin­ga­porean pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Polo Club, serv­ing for 12 years, and re­mained a pa­tron un­til his death.</p>
    <p>One of his sons, Asad, went on to win a sil­ver medal in polo for Sin­ga­pore in the 2007 SEA Games.</p>
    <p>Mr Jum­ab­hoy was not only a ti­tan of in­dus­try, but also a com­mit­ted pub­lic ser­vant, ac­tively in­volved in pub­lic or­gan­i­sa­tions in­clud­ing Men­daki (where he was chair­man of Men­daki Hold­ings), the Is­lamic Religious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis), Na­tional Crime Preven­tion Coun­cil and the Na­tional Youth Achieve­ment Award Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>He was on the found­ing board of Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic and the Na­tional Her­itage Board, and led the re­build­ing of Masjid Kas­sim in Changi Road.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, he served on the Sin­ga­pore China Friend­ship As­so­ci­a­tion, the Global Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Peo­ple of In­dian Ori­gin and the Gandhi Me­mo­rial Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>For­mer for­eign min­is­ter Ge­orge Yeo de­scribed him as a guid­ing fig­ure.</p>
    <p>“I first got to know Ameer when he was part of our busi­ness del­e­ga­tion to In­dia in early 1993,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“I learnt a lot from him about In­dian his­tory and pol­i­tics, and treated him like an un­cle.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jum­ab­hoy’s ded­i­ca­tion to ac­tive cit­i­zenry was es­tab­lished in his time in In­dia dur­ing World War II, where he had fled with his mother and sib­lings on a ship his fa</p>
    <p>STEEPED IN HIS­TORY</p>
    <p>ther had per­suaded Ma­hatma Gandhi to send for the In­dian com­mu­nity in Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to the fam­ily state­ment.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence was for­ma­tive, Mr Jum­ab­hoy was to say later, giv­ing him a taste of what it meant to be a Bri­tish “sub­ject” though he lived a life of priv­i­lege in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The An­glo-Chi­nese School stu­dent fin­ished his ed­u­ca­tion in Bom­bay (now Mum­bai) and be­came deeply in­volved in In­dia’s strug­gle for in­de­pen­dence from the Bri­tish Em­pire.</p>
    <p>“While in In­dia, he par­tic­i­pated in the ‘Quit In­dia’ move­ment, and is con­sid­ered a ‘free­dom fighter’. He de­vel­oped a deep and life­long de­vo­tion to Ma­hatma Gandhi, and was ar­rested sev­eral times by the colo­nial au­thor­i­ties in the free­dom strug­gle,” said his fam­ily in yes­ter­day’s state­ment.</p>
    <p>“He was the epit­ome of the beloved rebel, al­ways chal­leng­ing norms and never rest­ing on his lau­rels. He will be greatly missed.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jum­ab­hoy leaves his four chil­dren, 11 grand­chil­dren and one great-grand­child. His wife, Amina, died of a heart at­tack in 1992 at the age of 68.</p>
    <p>He was buried at Choa Chu Kang Mus­lim ceme­tery yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>I first got to know Ameer when he was part of our busi­ness del­e­ga­tion to In­dia in early 1993. I learnt a lot from him about In­dian his­tory and pol­i­tics, and treated him like an un­cle.</p>
