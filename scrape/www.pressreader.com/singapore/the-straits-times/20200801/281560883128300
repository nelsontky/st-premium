    <p>Tor­ren­tial rains have sub­merged at least one quar­ter of Bangladesh, and the coun­try is ex­pected to see more se­vere and fre­quent flood­ing in the com­ing years as cli­mate change in­ten­si­fies the down­pours. The cur­rent floods, made worse by ris­ing sea lev­els, have in­un­dated over one mil­lion homes, dis­plac­ing 4.7 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>• Tor­ren­tial down­pours have sub­merged at least one-quar­ter of Bangladesh, wash­ing away the few things that count as as­sets for some of the world’s poor­est peo­ple – their goats and chick­ens, mud houses, sacks of rice stored for the lean sea­son.</p>
    <p>It is the lat­est calamity to strike the delta na­tion of 165 mil­lion peo­ple. Only two months ago, a cy­clone pounded the coun­try’s south-west.</p>
    <p>Along the coast, a ris­ing sea has swal­lowed vil­lages. And while it is too soon to as­cer­tain what role cli­mate change has played in these lat­est floods, Bangladesh is al­ready wit­ness­ing a pat­tern of more se­vere and more fre­quent river flood­ing than in the past along the mighty Brahma­pu­tra River, sci­en­tists say, and that is pro­jected to worsen in the years ahead as cli­mate change in­ten­si­fies the rains.</p>
    <p>“The suf­fer­ing will go up,” said Mr Sa­jedul Hasan, the hu­man­i­tar­ian di­rec­tor of BRAC, an in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment or­gan­i­sa­tion based in Bangladesh that is dis­tribut­ing food, cash and liq­uid soap to dis­placed peo­ple.</p>
    <p>This is one of the most strik­ing in­equities of the modern era. Those who are least re­spon­si­ble for pol­lut­ing Earth’s at­mos­phere are among those most hurt by its con­se­quences. The av­er­age Amer­i­can is re­spon­si­ble for 33 times more planet-warm­ing car­bon diox­ide than the av­er­age Bangladesh­i.</p>
    <p>This chasm has be­dev­illed diplo­macy for a gen­er­a­tion, and it is once again in stark re­lief as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic up­ends the global econ­omy and threat­ens to push the world’s most vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple deeper into ruin.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated 24 per cent to 37 per cent of the coun­try’s land­mass is sub­merged, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment es­ti­mates and satel­lite data. By Tues­day, ac­cord­ing to the most re­cent fig­ures avail­able, nearly 1 mil­lion homes were in­un­dated, af­fect­ing 4.7 mil­lion peo­ple. At least 54 have died, most of them chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent floods, which are a re­sult of in­tense rains up­stream on the Brahma­pu­tra, could last through the mid­dle of this month. Un­til then, Mr Tai­jul Is­lam, a 30-year-old share­crop­per whose house has washed away, will have to camp out in a makeshift bam­boo shel­ter on slightly higher ground.</p>
    <p>At least he was able to sal­vage the tin sheet that was once the roof of his house. With­out it, he said, his ex­tended fam­ily of nine would be ex­posed to the el­e­ments.</p>
    <p>His predica­ment is shared by the mil­lions among those on the front lines of cli­mate change glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The in­equity is strik­ing. One re­cent anal­y­sis has found that the world’s rich­est 10 per cent are re­spon­si­ble for up to 40 per cent of global en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age, in­clud­ing cli­mate change, while the poor­est 10 per cent ac­count for less than 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>An­other es­ti­mated that warm­ing had re­duced in­comes in the world’s poor­est coun­tries by be­tween 17 per cent and 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>In Bangladesh, the floods be­gan in June. Those who live along the Brahma­pu­tra are no strangers to flood­ing. When the river starts swelling, work stops, the land erodes, peo­ple move to higher ground and wait for the wa­ters to re­cede. They rely on their sav­ings or aid to feed them­selves.</p>
    <p>This year was dif­fer­ent. By the time the river flooded, in June, peo­ple were al­ready run­ning out of food, said Mr Hasan of BRAC.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the lock­down, the peo­ple with jobs had all but stopped work­ing. Re­mit­tances from rel­a­tives abroad, many of them newly un­em­ployed, had dried up. In the coun­try­side, peo­ple had be­gun to sell their goats and cat­tle at bar­gain prices. They had no food to eat.</p>
    <p>The Brahma­pu­tra is a fear­some, shape-shift­ing 3,840km river that erupts from the Ti­betan Hi­malayas and spills into north-east­ern In­dia be­fore merg­ing with the Ganges in Bangladesh and emp­ty­ing into the Bay of Ben­gal. Cli­mate change, too, is al­ter­ing the river’s fate.</p>
    <p>The rains have be­come more un­pre­dictable and the river is ris­ing above dan­ger­ous lev­els far more fre­quently than it did be­fore, ac­cord­ing to 35 years of flood­ing data an­a­lysed by Mr A.K.M. Sai­ful Is­lam, a wa­ter man­age­ment ex­pert at the Bangladesh Univer­sity of Engi­neer­ing and Tech­nol­ogy in Dhaka.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more and worse floods loom and no mat­ter what, Mr Is­lam said, the coun­try will have to adapt. That re­quires money to dredge rivers, main­tain em­bank­ments, im­prove drainage and of­fer aid to those who are re­peat­edly dis­placed and im­pov­er­ished.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are los­ing what­ever lit­tle they have,” said Ms Farah Kabir, the Bangladesh coun­try di­rec­tor for Ac­tionAid In­ter­na­tional, adding: “When and how are they go­ing to be sup­ported? When is the global com­mu­nity go­ing to take re­spon­si­bil­ity?”</p>
