    <p>The Min­istry of Health has added 16 an­tiretro­vi­ral drugs used for the treat­ment of the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus (HIV) to its list of sub­sidised drugs, mak­ing them much more af­ford­able for thou­sands of Sin­ga­pore­ans. These drugs have been added to the Med­i­ca­tion As­sis­tance Fund here.</p>
    <p>Since 35-year-old Avin Tan was di­ag­nosed with the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus (HIV) 12 years ago, he has trav­elled to places like Bangkok or asked friends – through var­i­ous chan­nels – to ob­tain more cheaply two medicines that he needs to take ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>For more than three years, he has not switched to a newer drug with fewer side ef­fects, as he can­not af­ford it.</p>
    <p>So it was wel­come news that the Min­istry of Health (MOH) has added 16 an­tiretro­vi­ral drugs used for the treat­ment of HIV to its list of sub­sidised drugs as of last Tues­day, mak­ing them much more af­ford­able for thou­sands of Sin­ga­pore­ans like Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this, it cost him more than $500 a month to buy the two drugs he needs daily, Tru­vada and Edu­rant.</p>
    <p>Buy­ing the same med­i­ca­tion over­seas in places like Bangkok would lower the cost to around $150 a month, while a month’s doses of generic ver­sions of the med­i­ca­tion – which may not have a re­li­able sup­ply chain – would cost around $55.</p>
    <p>HIV an­tiretro­vi­ral drugs work by sup­press­ing the virus that causes ac­quired im­mune de­fi­ciency syn­drome (Aids), pre­vent­ing it from repli­cat­ing in the body.</p>
    <p>These drugs have been added to the Med­i­ca­tion As­sis­tance Fund here, which helps pa­tients who can­not af­ford the med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>All sub­sidised pa­tients can pur­chase any of these 16 drugs 50 per cent or 75 per cent more cheaply here, de­pend­ing on the pa­tient’s means-test sta­tus, the MOH said.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, those liv­ing with HIV could re­ceive help from the Med­i­ca­tion As­sis­tance Fund on a caseby-case ba­sis.</p>
    <p>The MOH told The Straits Times that it reg­u­larly re­views sub­sidised stan­dard and non-stan­dard drugs to en­sure that they re­main rel­e­vant to changes in the needs of the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion, med­i­cal prac­tice and ev­i­dence of clin­i­cal and cost ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>“The in­clu­sion of 16 an­tiretro­vi­ral drugs on Sept 1, 2020, is part of this reg­u­lar re­view,” it said.</p>
    <p>Groups that work with HIV pa­tients have long asked for an­tiretro­vi­ral drugs to be sub­sidised.</p>
    <p>With their in­clu­sion at last, Mr Tan, who is ad­vo­cacy and part­ner­ships man­ager at non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Ac­tion for Aids (AFA), will be con­sult­ing his doc­tor soon about switch­ing to the newer med­i­ca­tion with fewer side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Long-term use of HIV drugs could re­sult in the pre­ma­ture on­set of other dis­eases, such as hy­per­ten­sion, liver and kid­ney prob­lems, as well as os­teo­poro­sis.</p>
    <p>Sub­si­dis­ing these drugs also as­sures their safety, Mr Tan said.</p>
    <p>“By mak­ing it pos­si­ble for the drugs to be bought from hos­pi­tals, it al­lows for qual­ity con­trol and re­moves a lot of guess­work when we buy the drugs from other sources.”</p>
    <p>It will also help re­duce the stigma and dis­crim­i­na­tion faced by those who are HIV-pos­i­tive, he added. “It low­ers the bar­ri­ers for peo­ple to seek treat­ment, and al­lows HIV to be viewed just like any other ill­ness.”</p>
    <p>Ms Su­mita Ban­er­jee, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of AFA, lauded the move, say­ing that it will help to not only nor­malise HIV but also re­duce trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“Sub­si­dies also al­low peo­ple to ad­here to treat­ment. This im­proves treat­ment out­comes and qual­ity of life of peo­ple liv­ing with HIV. A per­son who is on treat­ment and has ac­quired vi­ral load sup­pres­sion can­not trans­mit HIV, and so it is also im­por­tant for HIV preven­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post last Wed­nes­day, Dr Wong Chen Seong, deputy di­rec­tor of the na­tional HIV pro­gramme at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases, said the sig­nif­i­cance of this move could not be over­stated.</p>
    <p>“The dream of end­ing HIV in our life­times is one step closer to fruition. Ac­cess to ef­fec­tive HIV treat­ment is the sine qua non (a Latin term for some­thing es­sen­tial) of get­ting peo­ple liv­ing with HIV to an un­de­tectable vi­ral load, which not only forms the foun­da­tion for per­sonal health and well-be­ing, but also pre­vents on­ward trans­mis­sion,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the MOH, a to­tal of 8,618 Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents had been in­fected with HIV as at the end of last year, and of that num­ber, 2,097 had died.</p>
