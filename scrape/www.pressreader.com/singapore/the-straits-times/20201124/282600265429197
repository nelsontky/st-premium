    <p>•</p>
    <p>SAO PAULO Afro-Brazil­ian mod­els Shirley Pitta and Glo­ria Maria Fon­seca Siqueira had dreamt of the cat­walk since they were lit­tle girls, but in a Brazil­ian fash­ion world much whiter than the coun­try it­self, it re­mained a far­away fantasy un­til re­cently.</p>
    <p>In a sign of chang­ing times in Brazil and else­where, they saw their dreams come true at this year’s Sao Paulo Fash­ion Week (SPFW).</p>
    <p>SPFW, one of the in­dus­try’s premier events, this year im­ple­mented a re­quire­ment for at least half of ev­ery la­bel’s mod­els to be people of colour, in a move hailed by black and indige­nous rights ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>“It took me a long time to see my­self as a beau­ti­ful per­son, a per­son who ex­ists. Be­cause on tele­vi­sion, I al­ways saw things I wasn’t,” says Pitta, 21, whose port­fo­lio in­cludes work for lead­ing fash­ion mag­a­zines Vogue, Elle and Marie Claire.</p>
    <p>She calls her­self a “black favela girl from the north-east”, re­fer­ring to the slums of Brazil’s most im­pov­er­ished re­gion.</p>
    <p>Her mod­ern-day Cin­derella story has cap­tured as much at­ten­tion as her strik­ing ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>Be­fore she was dis­cov­ered in 2018, she spent her days sell­ing grilled ke­babs out­side the zoo in her home town, Sal­vador.</p>
    <p>With her short hair, high cheek­bones and pierc­ing gaze, Pitta now ex­udes a con­fi­dence she says does not come as eas­ily as it might ap­pear.</p>
    <p>“When I was lit­tle, I used to wrap tow­els around my head”, ashamed of the way her hair looked, she says.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to talk about these things be­cause our chil­dren won’t have long, straight hair when they grow up, and they need to know that’s not a prob­lem. It’s some­thing beau­ti­ful.”</p>
    <p>In Brazil, the last coun­try in the Amer­i­cas to abol­ish slav­ery – in 1888 – around 55 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion iden­ti­fies as black or mixed-race.</p>
    <p>But al­though whites earn 74 per cent more than people of colour on av­er­age, a na­tional de­bate on racial inequal­ity has only be­gun rel­a­tively re­cently.</p>
    <p>The con­ver­sa­tion was per­haps de­layed by a long-held idea among the Brazil­ian elite that the coun­try was a “racial democ­racy” pro­tected from racism by the fact that most people have some black or indige­nous an­ces­try.</p>
    <p>So it was a sign of rad­i­cal change when SPFW, which was held re­motely this year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, re­quired more in­clu­sive cast­ing.</p>
    <p>That opened the doors to Pitta and 17-year-old Siqueira.</p>
    <p>Tall and thin, with an ex­u­ber­ant afro, Siqueira took a long time to re­alise she could have a fu­ture in the fash­ion world, de­spite people telling her she had po­ten­tial as a model.</p>
    <p>“I’ll never make it,” she re­mem­bers think­ing when she saw the model cat­a­logue at Ford Mod­els, one of the in­dus­try’s top agen­cies, as a 15-year-old.</p>
    <p>Now, she gives in­ter­views from the agency’s head­quar­ters in Sao Paulo. “I wasn’t con­fi­dent. I thought I wasn’t beau­ti­ful enough,” she says. “But now I know I can travel the world through this.”</p>
    <p>The youngest of seven chil­dren from a lower-mid­dle-class fam­ily, Siqueira grew up ad­mir­ing mod­els like Naomi Camp­bell and Adut Akech. She sees Brazil, home to su­per­model Gisele Bund­chen, as a coun­try of di­ver­sity, some­thing she would like to see it em­brace for its pos­i­tive as­pects.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, people feel like they’re less be­cause they’re dif­fer­ent and they try to fit a stan­dard that isn’t them. They don’t re­alise that be­ing dif­fer­ent is unique,” she says.</p>
    <p>Pitta sees the in­dus­try at a turn­ing point. “We’re break­ing through. I’m not go­ing to sit there think­ing about the past. We’re mov­ing for­ward,” she says.</p>
