    <p>The United States and China have de­layed the re­view of their phase one trade deal, orig­i­nally sched­uled for last Satur­day. The of­fi­cial rea­son was both sides need time.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus damp­ened China’s eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties, so it needs more time to buy the re­quired amount of US ex­ports. But the real rea­son is there’s noth­ing to dis­cuss. Nei­ther side wants to ne­go­ti­ate. If they did, they would have set a new date. Yet they haven’t. No one knows when the US and China will meet next.</p>
    <p>Should we be sur­prised? As re­cently as last month, US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Robert Lighthizer said: “I don’t know what the end goal is.” A re­view is meant to “fig­ure out new rules”. Mr Lighthizer main­tained that the US has worked with al­lies – he met rep­re­sen­ta­tives from Ja­pan and Ger­many to try and re­form the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO). “What phase one is, is an at­tempt to find those kinds of rules – and these are set­ting aside all the ag­gres­sion in In­dia and Hong Kong,” said Mr Lighthizer.</p>
    <p>For US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin, any dis­cus­sion would be un­bear­able. He is chair­man of CFIUS (Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment in the US), a panel that re­views TikTok and makes rec­om­men­da­tions to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. His panel urged the Pres­i­dent to delist Chi­nese com­pa­nies that trade on US ex­changes and that do not meet US ac­count­ing stan­dards.</p>
    <p>WHAT HAS LED TO THIS?</p>
    <p>Trade ne­go­ti­a­tions have never been down­graded to such a sideshow be­fore. To­day, wages in China are higher than in neigh­bour­ing coun­tries such as Viet­nam and the Philip­pines. The Peo­ple’s Bank of China spends more time prop­ping up the yuan than driv­ing it down.</p>
    <p>It’s not that China doesn’t want to buy from the US. The US$200 bil­lion (S$274 bil­lion) worth of Amer­i­can goods im­ported last year was a small por­tion of the US$2 tril­lion im­port trade. It’s the US that doesn’t want to sell what China wants. This moves things away from a trade war to a tech­nol­ogy bat­tle.</p>
    <p>As part of the phase one deal, Bei­jing promised to pun­ish</p>
    <p>Chi­nese firms that steal cor­po­rate trade se­crets. Bei­jing would stop mak­ing Chi­nese com­pa­nies ob­tain for­eign tech­nolo­gies through ac­qui­si­tions. Then came the ban­ning of TikTok and WeChat, and the in­creas­ing crack­down on Huawei. Washington’s mes­sage is clear: We can’t trust China on any­thing be­cause it’s run by the Com­mu­nist Party of China. We must stop China at all costs.</p>
    <p>These costs would in­clude bar­ring Amer­i­can con­sumers from choos­ing TikTok. Thus, the gov­ern­ment will ba­si­cally tell the Amer­i­can peo­ple how to use the In­ter­net prop­erly. This un­con­sti­tu­tional act is ex­actly how TikTok plans to sue the ad­min­is­tra­tion in a Cal­i­for­nia court. The costs would in­clude mak­ing the iPhone use­less among Chi­nese con­sumers by ban­ning WeChat from Ap­ple’s App Store.</p>
    <p>It’s the same re­align­ment be­tween busi­ness and gov­ern­ment that hap­pens dur­ing wartime.</p>
    <p>His­to­ri­ans will study how, un­der Mr Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, the po­lit­i­cal elites are flip­ping from be­ing “panda hug­gers” to “China hawks”. But if any side is to win, it needs an ally. And nei­ther is build­ing any al­liances.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has hardly won any friends abroad lately. There were the China-In­dia skir­mishes. Hong Kong events dam­aged its re­la­tion­ship with the United King­dom. Ten­sions with Ja­pan are ris­ing over dis­puted is­lands. Then there’s the con­tested ter­ri­tory in the South China Sea, with Viet­nam, the Philip­pines, Tai­wan, Malaysia, and Brunei all stak­ing their claims.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Trump is re­ject­ing co­op­er­a­tion with Amer­i­can al­lies. He threat­ened to over­turn the North Amer­i­can Free Trade Agree­ment, on which es­sen­tial sup­ply chains in Canada and Mex­ico de­pend. He plans to up­end the WTO. He sig­nals for­mal with­drawal from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion. He at­tacks the North At­lantic Treaty Or­gan­i­sa­tion. He is push­ing the US to­wards iso­la­tion to make it great again.</p>
    <p>So, where does it leave Europe and a host of other smaller economies?</p>
    <p>WHAT COULD BE THE OUT­COME?</p>
    <p>It’s hu­man na­ture to as­sume one side will even­tu­ally win. The Cold War ended with the lib­eral tri­umph of the West. And so, the US must en­sure a West­ern world or­der that will last for an­other 100 years. But what if it can’t?</p>
    <p>Not that China will dom­i­nate the West – it can’t. In­stead, the two economies, the two po­lit­i­cal sys­tems, the two vastly dif­fer­ent sets of val­ues will co­ex­ist, for­ever. One can no longer claim su­pe­ri­or­ity over the other. The coro­n­avirus out­break has been the lat­est judge.</p>
    <p>De­spite plenty of warn­ings, the West couldn’t mo­bilise its re­sources. This has taken the world by sur­prise. It has be­come clear that gov­ern­ments in the US and Europe can’t safe­guard their pop­u­la­tions. In­stead, Asia – South Korea,</p>
    <p>Tai­wan and Sin­ga­pore – have been hailed (at vary­ing times) as the role model. These coun­tries haven’t copied West­ern ideals whole­sale.</p>
    <p>Then again, never mind about who’s go­ing to win over the next 100 years. The US can win and hold back China’s tech­no­log­i­cal de­vel­op­ment. But with­out an ad­vanced so­lu­tion, China will keep pump­ing out green­house gases. And the flood­ing in Florida and New York City, the wild­fires in Cal­i­for­nia, and the drought in the Mid­west will turn Amer­ica into a liv­ing hell.</p>
    <p>That is the great dis­so­nance.</p>
    <p>The trade talks are in­fected by geopol­i­tics, which in turn ob­sess over na­tional dom­i­nance. The nar­ra­tive is stuck at a point 50 years ago, when no global cri­sis ex­isted. Be­hind the Iron Cur­tain, peo­ple lived in­de­pen­dently. Nations can pick sides. Yet politi­cians, hav­ing grown up in the last era, still ob­sess over win­ning an out­dated bat­tle.</p>
    <p>In this sce­nario, though, noth­ing is wait­ing for them be­hind the fin­ish line. There will be no gold tro­phy. The two su­per­pow­ers will wake up, even­tu­ally. The worst night­mare would be mit­i­gated to a de­gree.</p>
    <p>So it’s not a ques­tion of If, but When.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, smaller coun­tries will po­si­tion well by prac­tis­ing an open econ­omy and in­ter­na­tional trade. When Hong Kong’s lead­ing po­si­tion as a fi­nan­cial hub is be­ing threat­ened by the US sanc­tion, Sin­ga­pore may mo­bilise re­sources to take full ad­van­tage. Un­der pres­sure from the US, Is­rael an­nounced late last year that it would form an over­sight panel to scru­ti­nise Chi­nese in­vest­ment. But scru­ti­n­is­ing for­eign in­vest­ment in Is­raeli tech­nol­ogy start-ups was not in­cluded in the panel’s man­date. Ger­many is go­ing to look at China dif­fer­ently than Eng­land.</p>
    <p>For now, gov­ern­ment agen­das are driv­ing busi­nesses. But the fight be­tween the two giants won’t last be­cause it doesn’t solve the real threat to hu­man­ity it­self. The tenet for suc­cess among smaller nations re­mains un­changed: Widen trade with China when pos­si­ble and in­dulge Amer­i­can de­mands when nec­es­sary.</p>
