    <p>Ja­pan is a coun­try of con­tra­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>Sky­scrapers tower over the cen­tury-old gar­den with tra­di­tional Ja­panese struc­tures from the Edo pe­riod. The most non­de­script of­fice build­ing houses a world-fa­mous sushi restau­rant. Even in ru­ral ar­eas that are barely lit af­ter night­fall, you can find pub­lic re­strooms with high-tech toi­let seats.</p>
    <p>From the city of Tokyo, which never sleeps, to the calm seren­ity of nat­u­ral hot springs in the coun­try­side, Ja­pan has many faces – ex­cit­ing, re­lax­ing, fu­tur­is­tic and tra­di­tional all at the same time.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore may not be able to recre­ate all of Ja­pan’s facets, there are still ways to ex­pe­ri­ence the land of the ris­ing sun from the lit­tle red dot.</p>
    <p>SOAK IN TRA­DI­TIONAL JA­PANESE CUL­TURE</p>
    <p>Per­haps the best way to feel in touch with Ja­pan is to en­gage in some of its old­est cus­toms. At En Ja­panese Tea Cul­ture, Ms Ya­suko Nor­ris teaches stu­dents about the tra­di­tional tea cer­e­mony and ki­mono dress­ing.</p>
    <p>Her tea cer­e­mony lessons are priced at $60 a per­son for a 90-minute class, while her ki­mono dress­ing lessons start at $240 for four lessons. The 53-year-old, who has been in Sin­ga­pore for 10 years, is a qual­i­fied ki­mono teacher and dresser cer­ti­fied by the Hakubi Ky­oto Ki­mono School in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Her Mo­hamed Sul­tan Road stu­dio has a washitsu (Ja­panese-style room with tatami floors) and will trans­port one in­stantly to Ja­pan. For more in­for­ma­tion, go to www. en­tea­cul­ture.com.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, find ex­quis­ite Ja­panese crafts­man­ship at Huls Gallery atop Dux­ton Hill, which sources home­ware from around Ja­pan, in­clud­ing porce­lain, lac­quer­ware, ce­ramic and glass pieces made by Ja­panese ar­ti­sans.</p>
    <p>TUCK INTO JA­PANESE CUI­SINE</p>
    <p>Ja­panese food is pos­si­bly one of the most pop­u­lar cuisines in Sin­ga­pore. Lo­cals are spoilt for choice with iza­kayas, kaiseki restau­rants, shabu-shabu and sushi rang­ing from af­ford­able to high-end. Then there is, of course, ra­men.</p>
    <p>Enishi at In­ter­na­tional Plaza, a hole-in-the-wall joint which orig­i­nates from Kobe, serves up flavour­ful bowls of dan dan noo­dles and Ja­panese dashi ra­men.</p>
    <p>It has only counter seats, from which cus­tomers can ob­serve the chef at work – rem­i­nis­cent of Ja­pan’s many small yet pop­u­lar ra­men joints.</p>
    <p>For more ca­sual Ja­panese fare, check out cafes such as Grand Jete Cafe & Bar at Ngee Ann City or Baris­tart Cof­fee in Tras Street. Grand Jete has more teishoku (set meal) menus that come with pick­les and miso soup, but its pop­u­lar items are its sand­wiches, such as the pork and prawn cut­let sand­wiches.</p>
    <p>Baris­tart Cof­fee is fa­mous for its cof­fee and sweets. The Hokkaidoba­sed cafe chain, which uses Hokkaido dairy as a key in­gre­di­ent in many of its items, has a de­li­ciously sin­ful cream puff that is beloved by cus­tomers. Also worth try­ing are its soft-cream and cof­fee drinks made with Hokkaido’s Biei Jer­sey milk. Baris­tart Cof­fee also has a store along Siloso Beach, Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>In the mood to splurge and take a nice pic­ture? Keyaki at Pan Pa­cific Sin­ga­pore, which serves more up­mar­ket kaiseki, sashimi and tep­pa­nyaki meals, is si­t­u­ated within a quaint Ja­panese gar­den with a tra­di­tional pav­il­ion per­fect for that In­sta­gram shot.</p>
    <p>For drinks, head to RPM by D.Be­spoke. The Dux­ton Road bar, which has a dizzy­ing se­lec­tion of Ja­panese shochu, does tra­di­tional and shochu-based cock­tails well. Vinyl records, which take pride of place in the bar’s decor and are played in the back­ground, in­clude sig­na­ture hits from the Ja­panese city pop genre like Mariya Takeuchi’s Plas­tic Love (1984).</p>
    <p>WATCH JA­PANESE FILMS AND TELE­VI­SION SHOWS</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese Film Fes­ti­val in Sin­ga­pore will run from Dec 10 to 20 this year with phys­i­cal movie screen­ings at Shaw The­atres Lido and The Pro­jec­tor, as well as vir­tual stream­ing on Shaw Ki­noLounge.</p>
    <p>It will open with drama Bento Ha­rass­ment and in­clude films with pop­u­lar Ja­panese stars such as singer Gen Hoshino in the pe­riod com­edy film Samu­rai Shifters, ac­tor-singer Takuya Kimura in the mys­tery Mas­quer­ade Ho­tel and ac­tor Joe Oda­giri’s di­rec­to­rial de­but They Say Noth­ing Stays The Same.</p>
    <p>The fan­tasy an­i­ma­tion Chil­dren Of The Sea also looks beau­ti­ful, judg­ing from its trailer alone. For more in­for­ma­tion, go to jff.sg.</p>
    <p>For those who pre­fer to j ust en­joy Ja­panese con­tent from ex­ist­ing stream­ing ser­vices, there are op­tions as well.</p>
    <p>The episodic Mid­night Diner and its sis­ter se­ries Mid­night Diner: Tokyo Sto­ries on Net­flix are both an­chored by the same fic­tional chef and the diner he runs in the back­streets of Shin­juku.</p>
    <p>Its open­ing theme, with its slow, pan­ning cam­era shots of Shin­juku at night and the episodes – each of which cen­tres on a par­tic­u­lar food item the chef makes – has an au­then­tic Ja­panese flavour that is com­fort­ing to in­dulge in.</p>
    <p>On Ama­zon Prime Video, the se­ries Tokyo Girl will also give a taste of the tit­u­lar cap­i­tal. It fol­lows a woman named Aya from the coun­try­side prov­ince of Akita, who heads to Tokyo with dreams of a suc­cess­ful ca­reer and happy mar­riage. Each episode tracks her ca­reer growth and love life in the city.</p>
    <p>Episodes are named af­ter Tokyo neigh­bour­hoods that Aya lives in and the city it­self is al­most like a char­ac­ter that dis­plays many as­pects of its per­son­al­ity – the sim­ple and friendly San­gen-jaya, the hip, fash­ion­able Ebisu, the fam­i­ly­ori­ented Toyosu and the in­de­pen­dent, spir­ited Yoyogi-Ue­hara.</p>
    <p>JA­PANESE BEAUTY AND FASH­ION</p>
    <p>For Ja­panese fash­ion that is not Uniqlo, check out Colony Cloth­ing at UE Square, a shop which fo­cuses on menswear but has wom­enswear as well from its own brand Colony Cloth­ing and pop­u­lar Ja­panese brands such as Beams and Ring Jacket. It also stocks for­eign brands such as the Ital­ian-crafted Felisi.</p>
    <p>The clean, min­i­mal­ist look of the store high­lights its Ja­panese sen­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Women can also go to Lu­mine at Clarke Quay Cen­tral for a se­lec­tion of Ja­pan’s most pop­u­lar brands, such as the higher-end To­mor­row­land and the more af­ford­able Wego.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese beauty ser­vices with top-notch ser­vice are aplenty in Sin­ga­pore as well, with hair sa­lons like Hair Stu­dio Flamingo, which has two branches in Neil Road and Tiong Bahru, staffed with Ja­panese stylists.</p>
    <p>While hot springs are rare in Sin­ga­pore, the bath­house ex­pe­ri­ence can still be repli­cated here with Yunomori Onsen & Spa at Kal­lang Wave Mall. All-day ac­cess to the day spa’s onsen fa­cil­i­ties costs $38 and there are add-on ser­vices such as Thai mas­sage ther­a­pies, fa­cials and hair re­moval ser­vices.</p>
    <p>IN­SIDER’S TIPS</p>
    <p>Mrs Emiko Sakashita, com­mu­ni­ca­tion di­rec­tor for Ja­panese fash­ion store Colony Cloth­ing, keeps her Ja­panese rec­om­men­da­tions sim­ple.</p>
    <p>The mother of two, 42, moved to Sin­ga­pore six years ago with her sushi chef hus­band Masaaki Sakashita, who re­cently opened fine-din­ing sushi restau­rant Masaaki in South Beach Av­enue.</p>
    <p>Mrs Sakashita says shop­ping at Ja­panese depart­ment stores and su­per­mar­kets re­minds her of home.</p>
    <p>“What re­ally feels like home is Ja­panese ser­vice. In Ja­pan, in depart­ment stores such as Ise­tan and Takashimay­a, the staff bow deeply to the guests when their doors open in the morn­ing. When I’m greeted po­litely in Ja­panese stores here, I feel the sense of be­ing at home.</p>
    <p>“For gro­ceries, the Ja­panese su­per­mar­ket at the base­ment of Ise­tan Scotts and Meidi-ya at Great World City re­ally feel like Ja­pan. There’s a great va­ri­ety of miso and natto (fer­mented soya bean) to choose from and those are sta­ples in my cook­ing.”</p>
    <p>The fash­ion-for­ward woman, who mixes menswear and wom­enswear in her own style, gets her sar­to­rial fix where she works – at Colony Cloth­ing, which also runs two more stores in Sin­ga­pore, the per­fume, bath and body prod­ucts brand Santa Maria Novella’s counter at Ise­tan and Amer­i­can Shoe Store at Man­darin Gallery.</p>
    <p>“Our founder, Mr Kozo Kawa­mura, will some­times go to Ja­panese book­stores like Ki­noku­niya to get in­spi­ra­tion from Ja­panese fash­ion mag­a­zines.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, there are not as many fash­ion-fo­cused mag­a­zines as there are in Ja­pan, with dif­fer­ent mag­a­zines fo­cus­ing on dif­fer­ent styles. So to get the lat­est style news, Ja­panese mag­a­zines are re­ally help­ful.”</p>
