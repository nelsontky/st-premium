    <p>Sil­ver jumped to the high­est in al­most seven years yesterday and gold con­tin­ued its march to­wards a record on ex­pec­ta­tions of more stim­u­lus to help the global econ­omy re­cover from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­vestors have flocked to the met­als on surg­ing de­mand for havens amid a resur­gence in virus cases, slow­ing growth, a weaker US dol­lar and neg­a­tive real in­ter­est rates in the United States.</p>
    <p>The vast amounts of stim­u­lus from gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks have also aided prices, and after the suc­cess of a Euro­pean rescue pack­age this week, the fo­cus turns to ne­go­ti­a­tions on leg­is­la­tion to prop up the US econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver’s surge has had an added boost from sup­ply con­cerns and op­ti­mism about a re­bound in in­dus­trial de­mand. Hold­ings in ex­change-traded funds (ETFs) backed by the metal are at a record, while gold ETFs rose the most since mid-June on Tues­day and sit at the high­est-ever price.</p>
    <p>“Like gold, sil­ver has ben­e­fited this year from safe haven de­mand and fall­ing long-term US real yields,” Com­mon­wealth Bank of Aus­tralia an­a­lyst Vivek Dhar said in a note. “A sus­tained rally in sil­ver can con­tinue, par­tic­u­larly when de­mand hopes and sup­ply con­cerns are added to the mix.”</p>
    <p>Spot sil­ver climbed 7.2 per cent to US$22.8366 an ounce, the high­est since 2013, be­fore trad­ing at US$22.5156 at 7.37am in Lon­don (2.37pm Sin­ga­pore time). Fu­tures on the Comex jumped as much as 7.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Gold for im­me­di­ate de­liv­ery rose as much as 1.3 per cent to US$1,865.81 an ounce, the high­est since Septem­ber 2011, and clos­ing in on the all-time high of US$1,921.17 set that year.</p>
    <p>A gauge of the green­back is near the low­est since March.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese sil­ver and gold stocks rose, in­clud­ing a more than 30 per cent jump for China Sil­ver Group in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver should con­tinue to gain due to its use in in­dus­trial ap­pli­ca­tions such as so­lar cells, in ad­di­tion to a raft of fac­tors spurring other pre­cious met­als higher, Mr Ed Morse, global head of com­mod­ity re­search at Cit­i­group, said in a Bloomberg TV in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Citi pre­vi­ously noted the metal tends to per­form very strongly when de­sire for wealth pro­tec­tion is high and economic ac­tiv­ity is im­prov­ing.</p>
    <p>The Sil­ver In­sti­tute ear­lier this month fore­cast a 7 per cent de­cline in mine pro­duc­tion this year on dis­rup­tions due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Sil­ver is surg­ing, and we think it is likely to re­main strong,” Mr James Steel, chief pre­cious met­als an­a­lyst at HSBC Se­cu­ri­ties (USA), said in a note.</p>
