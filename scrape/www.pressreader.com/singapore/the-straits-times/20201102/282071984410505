    <p>Hav­ing been the main care­giver to her 87-year-old mother who has de­men­tia for eight years, Ms Kris Foo’s con­stant com­pan­ion has been emo­tional, men­tal and fi­nan­cial stress.</p>
    <p>The self-em­ployed brand­ing de­signer suf­fered from care­giver burnout in 2015, af­ter fac­ing daily bouts of tantrums that stemmed from her mother’s de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>“I woke up one day and I just started cry­ing. But look­ing back now, there were tell­tale signs – I was get­ting in­creas­ingly ir­ri­ta­ble and lost my fo­cus on ev­ery­thing else be­sides care­giv­ing,” said Ms Foo, 53, who is sin­gle and has an older sis­ter. Her mother has been di­vorced for 40 years.</p>
    <p>“My busi­ness suf­fered as a re­sult of this, and I had to start draw­ing on my mother’s savings to cover her med­i­cal and house­hold ex­penses,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Foo also grap­pled with neg­a­tive feel­ings such as the loss of self­i­den­tity, sui­ci­dal thoughts and the har­row­ing re­al­ity that de­men­tia pa­tients will never “get bet­ter”, as their con­di­tion wors­ens over time.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Ms Foo be­gan send­ing her mother to day­care – which gave her five ex­tra hours each day to catch up on her work and sleep.</p>
    <p>See­ing a coun­sel­lor also helped her to bet­ter iden­tify and cope with stress, though she now finds her­self grap­pling with the larger is­sue of self-care.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, un­cer­tainty over her fu­ture and re­tire­ment plans has weighed on her.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a visit to a geri­a­tri­cian in July, she was told that it was time to “care for the care­giver”, as the doc­tor could tell she was head­ing towards an­other burnout.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions were made to send her mum to a nurs­ing home and they are await­ing the out­come.</p>
    <p>Although Ms Foo knew that such a de­ci­sion would be cru­cial for her men­tal well-be­ing, it is one that she made while rid­den with guilt.</p>
    <p>“There’s al­ways that sense of aban­don­ment tied to nurs­ing homes. It has not been easy warm­ing her up to the idea of mov­ing to some place else that isn’t her own home, and for her to un­der­stand that I can’t look af­ter her by my­self any more,” she said.</p>
    <p>While Ms Foo yearns to restart her own life, the guilt is not easy to deal with.</p>
    <p>“The shift in re­al­ity and em­brac­ing a life­style of not liv­ing with my mother will be a huge ad­just­ment for me, and coun­selling and so­cial sup­port will be im­por­tant as I make th­ese tran­si­tions in life,” she added.</p>
    <p>Care­giver guilt is a fa­mil­iar feel­ing for many, as the deeply en­trenched val­ues of fil­ial piety and duty of­ten come at the ex­pense of self-care, said ex­perts here.</p>
    <p>Dr Annabelle Chow, prin­ci­pal clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at Annabelle Psy­chol­ogy, noted that as so­ci­ety’s view of fa­mil­ial care­givers is cen­tred on duty and obli­ga­tion, those</p>
    <p>DIF­FI­CULT DE­CI­SION</p>
    <p>There’s al­ways that sense of aban­don­ment tied to nurs­ing homes. It has not been easy warm­ing her up to the idea of mov­ing to some place else that isn’t her own home, and for her to un­der­stand that I can’t look af­ter her by my­self ’’ any more.</p>
    <p>MS KRIS FOO, on send­ing her 87-year-old mother who has de­men­tia to a nurs­ing home.</p>
    <p>who need help are wor­ried of be­ing dis­missed or shunned.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, many care­givers tend to un­der-re­port feel­ings of stress be­cause of the guilt that they face.</p>
    <p>“Care­givers are of­ten used to a con­stant rou­tine of car­ing, and when they are not, they feel guilty for be­ing away, and that they are not do­ing their job well or ful­fill­ing their duty.</p>
    <p>“This wors­ens if they de­cide to take time off to re­cu­per­ate, where they may feel ‘self­ish’ for do­ing so,” she added.</p>
    <p>Very few care­givers seek help for them­selves at her clinic, Dr Chow noted. Rather, they of­ten ac­com­pany those they are car­ing for, and would con­fide their dif­fi­cul­ties with the psy­chol­o­gist in pass­ing dur­ing a con­sul­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>So­cial en­tre­pre­neur and for­mer Nom­i­nated Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment (NMP) Anthea Ong said it is com­mon for many care­givers to de­pri­ori­tise their own emo­tional needs out of guilt.</p>
    <p>“Some think that it is their re­spon­si­bil­ity as a fam­ily mem­ber, and that ask­ing for sup­port is too dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>“But it is not mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive to be fil­ial and still look af­ter our own well-be­ing, so care­giver ed­u­ca­tion is para­mount in mak­ing sense of th­ese ideas and feel­ings,” she noted.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tance and re­sources for care­givers could be made avail­able and more vis­i­ble at all gen­eral prac­ti­tioner and other clin­ics, along with care­giver sup­port of­fices at poly­clin­ics, sug­gested Ms Ong.</p>
    <p>Peer sup­port train­ing and care­giv­ing classes could also be held at com­mu­nity cen­tres, she added.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) said SG En­able, a dis­abil­ity ser­vice and sup­port or­gan­i­sa­tion, has worked with so­cial ser­vice agen­cies and the com­mu­nity to or­gan­ise peer-topeer men­tor train­ing for care­givers of per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to five agen­cies and sup­port groups which The Straits Times spoke to, care­giv­ing stress has been on the rise dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, a re­sult of work-from-home ar­range­ments, a lack of care­giv­ing re­prieve, and fi­nan­cial stress from re­duced in­comes and loss of jobs.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing help that care­givers can tap in­cludes an an­nual $200 Care­givers Train­ing Grant ad­min­is­tered by the Agency for In­te­grated Care (AIC) to off­set the cost of en­rolling for cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Such cour­ses could help care­givers build their ca­pa­bil­i­ties and re­duce the level of stress that they face, agen­cies said.</p>
    <p>Care­givers of dis­abled per­sons may also be el­i­gi­ble for levy con­ces­sions if they wish to hire a for­eign do­mes­tic worker (FDW), and a Home Care­giv­ing Grant, a $200 monthly cash pay­out to de­fray the costs of care­giv­ing.</p>
    <p>The grant can also be used for hir­ing a FDW, said the MSF.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) last year showed that care­givers of el­derly pa­tients who em­ploy FDWs spent an av­er­age of al­most $1,300 monthly, whereas the monthly ex­penses with­out an FDW were around $380, with the dif­fer­ence likely due to greater care­giv­ing needs.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Aware noted that FDWs them­selves suf­fer stress and burnout, due to fac­tors such as over­work and in­ad­e­quate train­ing for el­der­care jobs.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Ms Foo noted that some of her FDWs had quit as they felt that they lacked train­ing and were not equipped to pro­vide el­der­care.</p>
    <p>The $200 Home Care­giv­ing Grant also cov­ers just a frac­tion of ex­penses, and does not ap­ply to med­i­cal ex­penses for care re­cip­i­ents, she added.</p>
    <p>Respite care ser­vices should also be more af­ford­able and ac­ces­si­ble, she said. Ms Foo con­sid­ered night respite care for her mum, who reg­u­larly wakes up six to eight times a night, but the cost of $100 to $150 each night is pro­hib­i­tive in the long term.</p>
    <p>One way to im­prove af­ford­abil­ity would be to al­low pay­ment for such ser­vices through Medis­ave or Med­i­fund, she said.</p>
    <p>A Care­giver Sup­port Grant that pro­vides ad­di­tional fi­nan­cial aid from the Gov­ern­ment would be help­ful, said Ms Shai­ley Hin­go­rani, Aware’s head of re­search and ad­vo­cacy.</p>
    <p>Ms Ong agreed and called for em­ploy­ers to of­fer more flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments and sup­port pro­grammes cen­tred on the well-be­ing of staff who are care­givers.</p>
    <p>But more press­ing is the need for a so­ci­etal shift towards valu­ing the work of care­givers “as no less es­sen­tial” than that pro­vided by health­care work­ers and other front lin­ers.</p>
    <p>“More vis­i­bil­ity, ap­pre­ci­a­tion and recog­ni­tion should be given to them for the crit­i­cal role that they play in so­ci­ety,” she added.</p>
    <p>CARE­GIVER GUILT</p>
    <p>It is not mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive to be fil­ial and still look af­ter our own well-be­ing, so care­giver ed­u­ca­tion is para­mount in mak­ing sense of th­ese ideas and ’’ feel­ings.</p>
