    <p>Train ser­vices on the Thom­son-East Coast Line (TEL) were dis­rupted for five hours yes­ter­day morn­ing due to a sig­nalling fault.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post in the af­ter­noon, rail op­er­a­tor SMRT said the fault was caused by a soft­ware glitch in the sig­nalling sys­tem’s net­work com­po­nent. As a re­sult, the com­po­nent had to be re­con­fig­ured be­fore the sys­tem could be re­set.</p>
    <p>Train ser­vices on the Thom­sonEast Coast Line (TEL) were dis­rupted for five hours yes­ter­day morn­ing due to a sig­nalling fault.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post in the af­ter­noon, rail op­er­a­tor SMRT said the fault was caused by a soft­ware glitch in the sig­nalling sys­tem’s net­work com­po­nent.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the com­po­nent had to be re­con­fig­ured be­fore the sys­tem could be re­set. The re­con­fig­u­ra­tion was car­ried out by en­gi­neers from sys­tems sup­plier Al­stom. “Af­ter com­plet­ing our pre-op­er­a­tions start-up pro­to­col, nor­mal train ser­vices com­menced,” said SMRT.</p>
    <p>The break­down was first an­nounced at 5.43am and lasted un­til 10.56am. Ser­vices at the three sta­tions on the line typ­i­cally be­gin at about 5.40am ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>In an up­date at 7.02am on Twit­ter, SMRT said train ser­vices be­tween Wood­lands North and Wood­lands South sta­tions re­mained down, and free reg­u­lar and bridg­ing bus ser­vices were avail­able. With Wood­lands in­ter­change be­tween the two, this is stage one of the TEL, which has been open since Jan 31.</p>
    <p>SMRT tweeted at 11.27am that the free bus ser­vices had ceased.</p>
    <p>“We are sorry for af­fect­ing your com­mute this morn­ing,” SMRT added on Face­book.</p>
    <p>It said in-train and sta­tion an­nounce­ments were made to in­form com­muters of the de­lay and of the avail­abil­ity of the free bus ser­vices con­nect­ing the three sta­tions.</p>
    <p>SMRT also said it de­ployed more than 20 of its staff on-site to as­sist af­fected com­muters.</p>
    <p>This was the sec­ond break­down this year on a new MRT line. In Oc­to­ber, a dam­aged power ca­ble be­tween Tuas Link and Tuas West Road sta­tions on the East-West Line (EWL) led to a se­ries of events that caused ma­jor ser­vice dis­rup­tions which also af­fected the North-South Line and Cir­cle Line.</p>
    <p>The two sta­tions are part of a four-sta­tion ex­ten­sion to the EWL that opened in June 2017.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said in Septem­ber that the com</p>
    <p>ple­tion of the six sta­tions in the sec­ond stage of the TEL will be de­layed by three months to the first quar­ter of next year be­cause of the im­pact of Covid-19. The sta­tions</p>
    <p>were ini­tially sched­uled to open late this year.</p>
    <p>Since July 30, ser­vices on stage one of the TEL have been end­ing ear­lier at 9pm daily and start­ing</p>
    <p>later at 6.30am on Satur­days and Sun­days for SMRT to “con­tinue test­ing of the in­te­grated sys­tems and trains in prepa­ra­tion for the open­ing of stage two” of the line. The</p>
    <p>early clo­sures and later open­ings were slated to end on Aug 30, but have since been ex­tended to Dec 31.</p>
