    <p>China sen­tenced out­spo­ken prop­erty ty­coon Ren Zhiqiang to 18 years’ jail on graft charges, months af­ter he was linked to an ar­ti­cle crit­i­cis­ing Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The for­mer chair­man of Huayuan Prop­erty was sen­tenced yes­ter­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to four charges in­clud­ing cor­rup­tion and abuse of power, the No. 2 Bei­jing In­ter­me­di­ate Peo­ple’s Court said.</p>
    <p>Ren was found to have amassed some 132 mil­lion yuan (S$27 mil­lion) in bribes and other ill-got­ten per­sonal ben­e­fits be­tween 2003 and 2017, the court said, adding that he had agreed not to ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions also in­cluded caus­ing some 117 mil­lion yuan of eco­nomic losses at un­spec­i­fied state-owned com­pa­nies, ac­cord­ing to the court, which pro­vided no de­tails about the crimes. Ren was fined 4.2 mil­lion yuan.</p>
    <p>The jail term was un­usu­ally long, al­though some fig­ures tar­geted dur­ing Mr Xi’s eight-year anti-graft cam­paign have been given sus­pended death sen­tences.</p>
    <p>If he serves out his full sen­tence, Ren, 69, would be about 87 by the time of his re­lease.</p>
    <p>The trial sent a warn­ing to any would-be crit­ics of Mr Xi, who has run China since 2012.</p>
    <p>Ren – the princeling son of a for­mer top Com­merce Min­istry of­fi­cial – built a rep­u­ta­tion for sharp com­men­tary on so­cial me­dia plat­form Weibo be­fore he crit­i­cised Mr Xi’s de­mands for greater loy­alty from state me­dia in 2016 and was sus­pended from the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party. Mr Xi, whose fa­ther, the late Xi Zhongxun, was a rev­o­lu­tion­ary hero turned vi­cepremier, is also a princeling.</p>
    <p>Ren has been un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion since March, when he was widely spec­u­lated to be the source of an anony­mous ar­ti­cle blam­ing a “cri­sis of gov­er­nance” for early ef­forts to cover up the coro­n­avirus out­break in Wuhan city.</p>
    <p>The piece warned against a grow­ing con­cen­tra­tion of power, de­scrib­ing the coun­try’s “great leader” as a “clown with no clothes who was still de­ter­mined to play em­peror”. Some of Ren’s sup­port­ers have ex­pressed doubt about the al­le­ga­tions, ar­gu­ing that Ren un­der­went an audit be­fore step­ping down from his post at Huayuan Prop­erty in 2011 that should have found wrong­do­ing.</p>
