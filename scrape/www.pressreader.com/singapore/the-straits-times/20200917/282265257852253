    <p>LONDON • London judges have ruled that some of the world’s big­gest in­sur­ers were wrong to re­ject tens of thou­sands of claims from small firms bat­tered by the Covid-19 pan­demic, Bri­tain’s Fi­nan­cial Con­duct Author­ity (FCA) said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The FCA, which brought the test case against eight in­sur­ers, said the court had found in favour of pol­i­cy­hold­ers’ ar­gu­ments on the ma­jor­ity of key is­sues in a com­plex, 162-page judg­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some of the in­sur­ers said the rul­ing meant they would not have to pay out, or would have to pay out much less than mod­elled in a worst-case sce­nario, and</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Fed­er­a­tion of Small Busi­nesses called the judg­ment a par­tial vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The law­suit has been closely watched be­cause it is es­ti­mated to af­fect 370,000 busi­nesses and bil­lions in in­surance claims.</p>
    <p>The FCA brought the case against the in­sur­ers, in­clud­ing His­cox, RSA, QBE and Zurich, in June to clar­ify whether 21 types of busi­ness in­ter­rup­tion (BI) pol­icy word­ings should pay out for clo­sures and dis­rup­tion caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor has es­ti­mated the case could af­fect more than 60 in­sur­ers and 700 dif­fer­ent types of poli­cies be­cause many in­surance poli­cies have sim­i­lar word­ing.</p>
    <p>It is also be­ing watched over­seas, the LIIBA in­surance bro­kers’ trade body said.</p>
    <p>Small busi­nesses – from cafes and wed­ding plan­ners to events busi­nesses – have said they faced ruin after at­tempts to claim com­pen­sa­tion for busi­ness losses dur­ing the pan­demic, which has prompted the most strin­gent gov­ern­ment re­stric­tions in peace­time his­tory, were re­jected by in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>FCA in­terim chief ex­ec­u­tive Christo­pher Woolard said the judg­ment was a “sig­nif­i­cant step” in re­solv­ing the un­cer­tainty faced by pol­i­cy­hold­ers and called on in­sur­ers to “re­flect on the clar­ity pro­vided”, ir­re­spec­tive of any pos­si­ble ap­peal, and con­sider how to progress claims.</p>
    <p>But the devil was in the de­tail.</p>
    <p>The As­so­ci­a­tion of Bri­tish In­sur­ers said the judg­ment “di­vided evenly” be­tween in­sur­ers and pol­i­cy­hold­ers on the main is­sues.</p>
    <p>Zurich In­surance and Ec­cle­si­as­ti­cal, a smaller in­surer, said the judg­ment con­firmed their dis­puted poli­cies did not need to pay out.</p>
    <p>His­cox said fewer than one third of its 34,000 UK BI poli­cies would have to pay out and that the net cost would be less than £100 mil­lion (S$175.7 mil­lion) – com­pared with ini­tial guid­ance of up to £250 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Shares in His­cox and RSA, which re­stored its cancelled 2019 div­i­dend and pointed out that some of its pol­icy in­ter­pre­ta­tions had been up­held by the court, leapt by 15 per cent and 6 per cent re­spec­tively, as the mar­ket wel­comed the re­moval of un­cer­tainty and a fresh fo­cus on growth.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia-based QBE said it was con­sid­er­ing its op­tions to ap­peal the rul­ing, say­ing the de­ci­sion over­all was still largely in its favour.</p>
    <p>It es­ti­mated its UK busi­ness in­ter­rup­tion claims ex­po­sure at around A$170 mil­lion (S$169 mil­lion) before al­low­ing for re­cov­er­ies un­der the group’s catas­tro­phe rein­sur­ance pro­tec­tions.</p>
    <p>Lloyd’s of London in­surer MS Am­lin said it would com­mu­ni­cate with af­fected clients “in the com­ing days”, while fel­low Lloyd’s in­sur­ers Arch and Ar­genta did not re­spond.</p>
    <p>The Lloyd’s of London com­mer­cial in­surance mar­ket said it had strong enough cap­i­tal to cope with the fi­nan­cial im­pli­ca­tions of the judg­ment.</p>
    <p>But some pol­i­cy­hold­ers were ju­bi­lant. Chief ex­ec­u­tive of ac­ces­sories firm Radley London Justin Stead said the judg­ment was “an ex­tremely im­por­tant out­come to se­cure the fu­ture for Radley”, adding that i nsur­ers should pay out quickly “to save as many busi­nesses as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Ms So­nia Camp­bell, part­ner at law firm Mish­con de Reya, which rep­re­sented two busi­ness ac­tion groups in the case, said the out­come was a “re­sound­ing vic­tory” for many firms.</p>
    <p>The FCA law­suit of­fered a new le­gal route by pool­ing to­gether a group of com­pany poli­cies and tak­ing in­sur­ers to court with min­i­mal costs to busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The case was de­signed to quickly clar­ify whether the pan­demic and a gov­ern­ment lock­down in March should trig­ger BI poli­cies, which pro­vide cover when in­sured premises can­not be used be­cause of re­stric­tions im­posed by a pub­lic author­ity and in the event of a no­ti­fi­able dis­ease or in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ers have ar­gued that most poli­cies did not cover the pan­demic, that they were pay­ing out valid claims as quickly as pos­si­ble and that be­ing forced to stump up for all losses from the pan­demic would be cat­a­strophic for the in­surance in­dus­try, and its backup, the rein­sur­ance in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>If the judg­ment is ap­pealed, it could leapfrog straight to t he Supreme Court, the high­est UK court, to re­duce de­lay for buck­ling busi­nesses, lawyers say.</p>
