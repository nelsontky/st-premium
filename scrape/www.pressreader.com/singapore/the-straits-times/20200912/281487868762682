    <p>LON­DON • Mikel Arteta said Arse­nal’s FA Cup tri­umph last sea­son had raised ex­pec­ta­tions at the club as he chases new sign­ings to boost their Premier League chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners fin­ished eighth in the league last year, their low­est po­si­tion since 1995, but beat Chelsea in the FA Cup fi­nal and over­came Liver­pool on penal­ties in the Com­mu­nity Shield, the sea­son’s cur­tain-raiser.</p>
    <p>“Every new sea­son brings new ex­pec­ta­tions,” said Arse­nal’s Spanish boss, whose side kick off the new</p>
    <p>Premier League sea­son to­day at newly-pro­moted Ful­ham.</p>
    <p>“I think ob­vi­ously the way we ended last sea­son and where we are start­ing this one with a ti­tle, ob­vi­ously peo­ple want to see more and more and more. This is a re­ally pos­i­tive sign. We want that type of en­ergy to drive our team for­ward and to­mor­row we have a great test at Ful­ham.”</p>
    <p>He said his play­ers were not con­tent with what they had achieved in his first sea­son at the Emi­rates but they had been boosted by win­ning sil­ver­ware.</p>
    <p>“What I see from them is that they want more,” he said at his pre­match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“They are not sat­is­fied and this is what we want to show to­mor­row, that we want to go another step for­ward.”</p>
    <p>He praised new re­cruits Wil­lian and Gabriel Ma­gal­haes but said the club, who re­main linked with mid­field­ers Thomas Partey and Houssem Aouar, were still ac­tive in the trans­fer mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment the squad bal­ance is not ideal,” said the Spa­niard. “There is still some work to do, but we have to bear in mind the com­pli­ca­tions of this mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>De­fender Gabriel, signed from Lille for a £22 mil­lion (S$38.5 mil­lion) ini­tial fee, could make his Gun­ners de­but to­day af­ter Arteta re­vealed that five of his cen­tre-backs – David Luiz, Sokratis Pa­pas­tathopou­los, Calum Cham­bers, Pablo Mari and Shko­dran Mustafi – have been ruled out.</p>
    <p>But Arteta calmed the nerves of Arse­nal fans by say­ing he was even more con­fi­dent than he was at the end of last sea­son that cap­tain Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang will sign a new deal. He also dis­missed sug­ges­tions fel­low striker Alexan­dre La­cazette could de­part dur­ing the cur­rent trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>Ful­ham man­ager Scott Parker has no in­jury con­cerns but new sign­ings Alphonse Are­ola and Kenny Tete are un­likely to make their Craven Cot­tage bows.</p>
