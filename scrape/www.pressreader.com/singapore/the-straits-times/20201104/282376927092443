    <p>A 61-year-old man who es­caped the gal lows more than two decades ago for killing a Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bu­reau (CNB) of­fi­cer has been sen­tenced to death for heroin traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten judg­ment re­leased on Mon­day, Jus­tice Va­lerie Thean re­jected Roshdi Abdullah Alt­way’s story that he was merely safe­keep­ing the drugs and that the $18,000 found on him was meant for a de­liv­ery of an­chovies.</p>
    <p>In 1994, Roshdi, who was 35 at the time, had his mur­der con­vic­tion quashed by the Court of Ap­peal and was sen­tenced to 10 years’ jail for cul­pa­ble homi­cide in­stead.</p>
    <p>Then, the apex court found that Roshdi, who was a CNB in­former, had hit In­spec­tor Ra­jab Mo­hamed, 35, with a gran­ite mor­tar in self-de­fence as he thought the of­fi­cer was go­ing for his re­volver.</p>
    <p>His 10-year sen­tence was or­dered to run con­sec­u­tively with a six-year term for un­law­ful pos­ses­sion of a re­volver and six bul­lets.</p>
    <p>In 2007, Roshdi was sen­tenced to 12 years’ jail and 10 strokes of the cane for traf­fick­ing Subu­tex tablets and for drug con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber 2016, he was ar­rested at the void deck of a block of flats in Com­pass­vale Lane with $18,000 in cash. Pack­ets of drugs, later an­a­lysed to con­tain 78.77g of heroin, were found in his rented room in the block.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tion re­lied pri­mar­ily on Roshdi’s state­ments, ar­gu­ing there was suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to prove be­yond a rea­son­able doubt he was in pos­ses­sion of the drugs for the pur­poses of traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>In his state­ments, Roshdi ad­mit­ted that the drugs in his room were for sale and that he had repacked and de­liv­ered drugs on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions. But dur­ing his trial, he back­tracked on what he had said. He con­tended that he was only safe­keep­ing the prepacked drugs for a per­son named Aru and had in­tended to re­turn them all along.</p>
    <p>Roshdi chal­lenged the ad­mis­si­bil­ity of his state­ments, claim­ing he had been in­duced to make them by CNB of­fi­cers who told him that there was a “new law” and that he would not be hanged if the drugs did not be­long to him.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Thean re­jected this, say­ing there was no rea­son for Roshdi to trust the of­fi­cers over the al­leged ut­ter­ances.</p>
    <p>More­over, by his own ac­count, Roshdi was sus­pi­cious of CNB of­fi­cers, stem­ming from his pre­vi­ously served jail terms for homi­cide and drug traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>“In light of Roshdi’s his­tory and per­sonal cir­cum­stances, the ex­pec­ta­tion was that Roshdi would be scep­ti­cal and wary, not trust­ing and un­ques­tion­ing,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Thean added that Roshdi was ex­plic­itly told about the pos­si­bil­ity of a death sen­tence.</p>
    <p>The judge said the items found in Roshdi’s room, which in­cluded three weigh­ing scales stained with heroin, sup­ported the nar­ra­tive of the state­ments rather than the ver­sion he gave at trial.</p>
    <p>She added that Roshdi was un­able to give a “lu­cid rea­son” for the cash, not­ing that $18,000 would have yielded 3,000kg of an­chovies, based on his pro­fessed price of $6 per kg.</p>
    <p>This ex­pla­na­tion for the cash was also in­con­sis­tent with the one he gave in his state­ments, where he claimed that the money was for a de­liv­ery of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes.</p>
    <p>“Roshdi’s pro­fessed will­ing­ness to lie, cou­pled with his il­log­i­cal re­sponses on the stand, went to is­sues of gen­eral cred­i­bil­ity and were con­sis­tent with my find­ing that the state­ments, rather than his ver­sion on the stand, were re­li­able,” said Jus­tice Thean.</p>
