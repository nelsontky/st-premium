    <p>The stems of my plant have soft white stains (right); the leaves have brown spots (right be­low) and some are torn. I tried to wash off the white patches, but they re­turn. What should I do?</p>
    <p>Jess Heng</p>
    <p>The white patches on your kangkong ap­pear to be the waxy se­cre­tions pro­duced by mealy bugs. Check for the pests on the stems and leaves.</p>
    <p>You may want to also take the plant out from its pot and check for root mealy bugs. These are com­mon in soil-less grow­ing mixes such as the one you are us­ing which has co­conut peat in it.</p>
    <p>Mealy bugs on the aerial parts of the plant can be erad­i­cated by us­ing a di­luted soap so­lu­tion or en­vi­ron­ment-friendly pes­ti­cides such as sum­mer oil or neem oil. Root mealy bugs are harder to deal with and the in­fested plant is best dis­carded.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing me­dia from root mealy bug-in­fested plants should not be reused and pots should be scrubbed clean. Con­trol the pop­u­la­tion and move­ment of ants in the grow­ing area as they can move mealy bugs from plant to plant.</p>
    <p>En­sure your plant re­ceives suf­fi­cient sun­light to pro­mote good health to re­duce the sever­ity of pest at­tacks.</p>
    <p>The brown spots on your kangkong leaves could be fun­gal leaf spots, which can oc­cur if plants are grown in an area with low light and poor air cir­cu­la­tion.</p>
