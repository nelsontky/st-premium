    <p>Mr James Neo had a prob­lem. As the founder of GetVan, an on-de­mand van ren­tal ser­vice, he faced a hur­dle fa­mil­iar to those in the lo­gis­tics space: dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing it­self from the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>To cus­tomers, lo­gis­tics is a de­cid­edly un­sexy busi­ness. It is merely a trans­ac­tional ser­vice to get things from point A to point B; hardly the kind of stuff that gen­er­ates brand love. This makes it dif­fi­cult for lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies to stand out in a crowded field.</p>
    <p>But Mr Neo, a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man turned en­tre­pre­neur, found a niche that has en­abled it to give es­tab­lished play­ers a run for their money — by pro­vid­ing a su­pe­rior cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>GetVan’s ori­gins</p>
    <p>Like the ori­gin story of many start-ups, GetVan was born out of frus­tra­tion with the sta­tus quo, or more specif­i­cally a trip Mr Neo made to a fur­ni­ture store in 2016. “I bought some stuff and wanted to bring it home im­me­di­ately, but they sched­uled de­liv­ery for a week later,” says the 44-year-old. “I had to set aside an en­tire day just wait­ing for them at home.”</p>
    <p>Mr Neo’s ex­pe­ri­ence led him to ask, “What if hir­ing a van could be as easy as or­der­ing a taxi?” And with that, GetVan was born.</p>
    <p>Flex­i­ble op­tions</p>
    <p>“Each move is unique,” says Mr Neo. “It can range from send­ing a small par­cel to mov­ing [the con­tents of] an en­tire room.” This vari­abil­ity was a source of frus­tra­tion for many con­sumers, he adds.</p>
    <p>Some com­peti­tors of­fered bun­dled ser­vices, forc­ing cus­tomers to pay more for ex­tra space or un­needed man­power. GetVan’s plat­form, mean­while, was de­signed to be fully cus­tomis­able, al­low­ing cus­tomers to pick and choose only the ser­vices that fit their needs.</p>
    <p>The base charge, which starts from as low as $8 for the small­est ve­hi­cle type, of­fers the bare bones: a van and a driver. From there, cus­tomers can build their or­der, se­lect­ing add-ons like ad­di­tional pickup lo­ca­tions and get­ting the driver to help with the move.</p>
    <p>Cre­at­ing a strong cul­ture</p>
    <p>For Mr Neo, the cog of a cus­tomer­centric com­pany is its driv­ers.</p>
    <p>“It all starts with them. Our driv­ers are our am­bas­sadors,” Mr Neo says.</p>
    <p>This starts with pay­ing them a fair wage, for rea­sons both al­tru­is­tic and prag­matic. “If we don’t pay them well, they will rush to com­plete jobs. Pay­ing them well means they can pro­vide the level of ser­vice we ex­pect,” he adds.</p>
    <p>At the same time, GetVan also has a strict code of con­duct to en­sure that ser­vice stan­dards are met. “While we are a pro-driver plat­form, we do not hes­i­tate to ban those who do not meet our ser­vice stan­dards. We take the cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence very se­ri­ously and we in­stil this cul­ture very strongly,” Mr Neo says.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the start-up’s early days, Mr Neo in­ter­viewed every driver per­son­ally. “We went through a lot of ap­pli­ca­tions to find driv­ers with the right at­ti­tude,” he says.</p>
    <p>“It is a dif­fi­cult task. Their role is not only to ful­fil a job but to de­light the cus­tomer.”</p>
