    <p>• Ger­many en­tered a strict lock­down yes­ter­day in an at­tempt to bring soar­ing coro­n­avirus cases un­der con­trol as the num­ber of reg­is­tered deaths from Covid-19 jumped by 952, the high­est daily in­crease yet.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous record daily death toll was 598, posted last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the fig­ures re­ported yes­ter­day are not ex­actly com­pa­ra­ble to pre­vi­ous days be­cause they were in­flated as a re­sult of a tech­ni­cal prob­lem in one state, ac­cord­ing to the Robert Koch In­sti­tute for in­fec­tious dis­eases, which col­lects the num­bers.</p>
    <p>Fears that the pan­demic is spi­ralling out of con­trol in the coun­try prompted Chan­cel­lor Angela Merkel and the 16 state gov­er­nors to an­nounce on Sun­day a tough lock­down un­til Jan 10, at the ear­li­est.</p>
    <p>Shops and schools will stay shut from yes­ter­day in a pre-Christ­mas tight­en­ing of re­stric­tions fol­low­ing a par­tial lock­down last month, which closed bars and restau­rants but failed to con­tain a sec­ond wave of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ger­many was more suc­cess­ful than many other Euro­pean coun­tries in keep­ing the coro­n­avirus un­der con­trol in the first wave ear­lier this year, but the sit­u­a­tion looks very dif­fer­ent now.</p>
    <p>The Robert Koch In­sti­tute put the num­ber of con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases at 1,379,238, an in­crease of 27,728. The to­tal death toll in Ger­many is 23,427.</p>
    <p>The seven-day in­ci­dence of cases ticked up to 180 per 100,000 peo­ple from 174 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Chan­cel­lor Merkel told law­mak­ers on Tues­day she was wor­ried by the coro­n­avirus trend and warned that Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary would be very tough months.</p>
    <p>Ger­mans are wait­ing for reg­u­la­tory ap­proval for a vac­cine partly de­vel­oped in their coun­try even as other places, in­clud­ing Bri­tain and the United States, are rolling it out.</p>
