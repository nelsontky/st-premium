    <p>Uno and Old Maid, Chope and The Sin­ga­porean Dream.</p>
    <p>Be it clas­sic card games or Sin­ga­pore ones, en­gi­neer Aaron Tan has played them all, be­ing an en­thu­si­ast since he was young.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old has gone on to cre­ate his own card game – Te­ab­bles.</p>
    <p>The bub­ble tea-themed card game, a joint ef­fort by Mr Tan and his wife Jo­lene Yang, 27, a flight at­ten­dant, was launched last Satur­day af­ter 11/ years of hard work.</p>
    <p>2 He toyed with the idea of mak­ing a card game with a lo­cal food theme in Au­gust last year. He first thought of chicken rice, but found it to be “too com­pli­cated”.</p>
    <p>“When I was think­ing of an idea, I was ac­tu­ally drink­ing bub­ble tea. That was when I thought, why not bub­ble tea?” he says.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, both bub­ble tea lovers, took on dif­fer­ent roles in the pro­duc­tion of Te­ab­bles – a name coined by join­ing the words “tea” and “bub­bles”.</p>
    <p>Ms Yang says: “He is re­spon­si­ble for tech­ni­cal as­pects such as re­fin­ing the game and the web­site, while I am in charge of In­sta­gram mar­ket­ing and de­sign.”</p>
    <p>Every­thing about Te­ab­bles – from con­cep­tu­al­i­sa­tion to print­ing to pro­duc­tion – was done in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the launch, there were about 100 pre-or­ders for Te­ab­bles, which sells for $28 a set.</p>
    <p>The card game is made up of 39 drink cards and 88 in­ven­tory cards. It can be played in groups of two to five peo­ple, in three ways: Orig­i­nal Play, Bluff and Boba The Builder.</p>
    <p>While all three vari­ants have spe­cific rules, the ob­jec­tive of the game is to match com­bi­na­tions of in­gre­di­ents to those re­flected on the drink cards.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nal Play is the eas­i­est vari­ant for be­gin­ners – to win, a player has to ful­fil drink or­ders with the in­gre­di­ents he or she has.</p>
    <p>The Bluff vari­ant is sim­i­lar, with the only twist be­ing that a player can lie about the in­gre­di­ents he or she has to make drinks.</p>
    <p>Each “drink” card is al­lo­cated a cer­tain num­ber of points.</p>
    <p>In Bluff, a player wins by hav­ing the high­est num­ber of points.</p>
    <p>In Orig­i­nal Play and Boba The Builder, the first one to reach 11 points wins.</p>
    <p>On the charm of old-school card games, Mr Tan says: “Nowa­days, peo­ple are al­ways on their phones play­ing mo­bile games. But the so­cial in­ter­ac­tion you get from phys­i­cal card games is dif­fer­ent com­pared with these vir­tual games.</p>
    <p>“We hope that through Te­ab­bles and other phys­i­cal card games, peo­ple will be able to bond with their loved ones and have fun.”</p>
    <p>Te­ab­bles is avail­able at a dis­counted price of $26 a set at the Christ­mas Mar­ket in Capi­tol Sin­ga­pore till Dec 25.</p>
