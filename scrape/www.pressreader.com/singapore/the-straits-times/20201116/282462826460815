    <p>Com­pet­ing on home soil in 2015, the na­tional men’s hockey team came within a whisker of clinch­ing Sin­ga­pore’s first SEA Games gold since 1993 when they lost 4-3 on penal­ties to Malaysia after draw­ing 2-2 in reg­u­la­tion time in the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>Five years on, Sin­ga­pore has not ended its gold medal drought. A con­sid­er­able gap re­mains be­tween the two coun­tries, with the Repub­lic’s men’s and women’s hockey teams ranked 36th and 38th in the world re­spec­tively as com­pared to the Malaysia men (11th) and women (20th).</p>
    <p>In a bid to close that gap, Sin­ga­pore Hockey Fed­er­a­tion (SHF) pres­i­dent Mathavan Devadas plans to hire a tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor, who will also over­see youth de­vel­op­ment, grass­roots in­volve­ment and tech­ni­cal of­fi­cials’ train­ing.</p>
    <p>“Our na­tional play­ers are at a par­tic­u­lar level now and if we can bring in a tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor who’s above that level and has more ex­per­tise, they can get the play­ers go­ing,” he told The Straits Times. “It’ll take time to close the gap but it’s achiev­able with the right sys­tems in place.”</p>
    <p>Mathavan and his team, who were elected for a two-year term last month, have also come up with other plans to raise the stan­dard of hockey in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He hopes to dou­ble the num­ber of in­ter­na­tional matches the na­tional teams play to 20 next year and hold more re­gional hockey tour­na­ments at home.</p>
    <p>SHF had planned to host a fourteam tour­na­ment for field hockey and in­door hockey this year which in­cluded par­tic­i­pants from Hong Kong, Thai­land and Viet­nam, but it was put on hold ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>Mathavan said: “If they play teams of dif­fer­ent ranks through­out the year, it builds be­lief in them so that would be a good start­ing point. Play­ing more in­ter­na­tional matches also gen­er­ates more in­ter­est in hockey. Be­cause when you hold these tour­na­ments and teams are do­ing well, peo­ple come to watch. Play­ers also get ex­cited and they want to be in­volved.”</p>
    <p>The short-term goal for the na­tional teams is to qual­ify for the 2022 Asian Games. The women’s team last com­peted at the Asiad in 1994 while the men fea­tured at the 2014 Games in In­cheon, South Korea.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that, the goal is for them to im­prove their world rank­ings and break into the top 20 or 30. A gold medal at the 2029 SEA Games is also a long-term tar­get, al­though Mathavan ad­mit­ted it would be tough to beat South­east Asia king­pins Malaysia.</p>
    <p>He said: “What has to hap­pen is play­ers have to be­lieve. If they be­lieve, they can do a lot of things.” Laura Chia</p>
