    <p>• Thurs­day’s plunge in United States eq­ui­ties, with big tech­nol­ogy firms post­ing the big­gest drop since March, was vin­di­ca­tion for bear­ish strate­gists whose voices had been get­ting louder.</p>
    <p>Warn­ings that val­u­a­tions were out of con­trol and in­vestors would pay for their eu­pho­ria have been swirling around for weeks amid a stretch in which the S&P 500 In­dex went 30 ses­sions with­out a 1 per cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, it fell 3.5 per cent, while the Nas­daq 100 In­dex lost 5.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Bears took a vic­tory lap as high­fly­ing stocks such as Zoom Video Com­mu­ni­ca­tions, Tesla and Ap­ple Inc dragged the Nas­daq 100 lower, af­ter the in­dex had ral­lied in 11 of the past 13 ses­sions.</p>
    <p>While the cor­rec­tion was abrupt, it was over­due given how crowded the mega-cap tech trade had be­come, ac­cord­ing to se­nior global mar­ket strate­gist Sameer Sa­mana of Wells Fargo In­vest­ment In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>And with mar­ket at­ten­tion likely to turn to the up­com­ing US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion af­ter the hol­i­day week­end, traders are likely trim­ming risk, he said.</p>
    <p>“While there was no one trig­ger, there’s prob­a­bly some ner­vous­ness and squar­ing up of po­si­tions head­ing into a long week­end,” he said. “Given the nice run, you could even de­scribe it as profit-tak­ing.”</p>
    <p>To be sure, that is all it was on June 11, when the S&P 500 lost 6 per cent. Its re­turn since then is about 15 per cent, even with Thurs­day’s dra­mat­ics.</p>
    <p>Tech has pow­ered the S&P 500’s al­most 55 per cent re­bound from its March lows.</p>
    <p>The dy­namic kicked into over­drive in re­cent weeks af­ter Ap­ple and Tesla’s stock splits caused the shares to surge.</p>
    <p>Prior to Thurs­day, the Nas­daq’s 41 per cent year-to-date gain ex­ceeded the Amer­i­can equity bench­mark’s ad­vance by about 30 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>That has pushed the rel­a­tive strength of the Nas­daq over the S&P 500 to the high­est on record.</p>
    <p>EP Wealth Ad­vi­sors’ direc­tor of port­fo­lio strat­egy Adam Phillips said: “At some point, you’re bound to see some profit-tak­ing and repo­si­tion­ing within port­fo­lios.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It’s hard to know what the fi­nal straw was for in­vestors, but the sell-off shouldn’t come as much of a sur­prise. It was quite ev­i­dent that ar­eas of the mar­ket were overex­tended.”</p>
    <p>The warn­ing signs were there. Im­plied volatil­ity on the Nas­daq 100 has been ris­ing even as the in­dex ral­lied – a rare align­ment that strate­gists warned would end pain­fully, as boom­ing de­mand for call op­tions forced deal­ers to re­cal­i­brate their hedges.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Ju­lian Emanuel from BTIG, while bet­ting against the tech bub­ble in the 2000s was painful for those who were early, Thurs­day’s rout is an op­por­tu­nity to re­bal­ance away from the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“We think the (Fed­eral Re­serve) has changed the game and fi­nan­cials will ul­ti­mately lead the mar­ket higher in 2021.”</p>
