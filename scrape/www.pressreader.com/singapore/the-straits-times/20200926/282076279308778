    <p>Mea­sures to pro­tect pub­lic trans­port work­ers from abuse, such as hav­ing a shield around a bus driver’s seat, are be­ing ex­plored, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Chee Hong Tat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he stressed that com­muters must also be­have them­selves and not re­sort to such abuse.</p>
    <p>“No amount of phys­i­cal bar­ri­ers can help to pro­tect the safety and dig­nity of our trans­port work­ers if the pub­lic does not sub­scribe to this im­por­tant con­cept of show­ing re­spect to our pub­lic trans­port work­ers and al­low­ing them to do their jobs (and) their du­ties in a safe en­vi­ron­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee was speak­ing at an ap­pre­ci­a­tion ses­sion held by SBS Tran­sit to thank two men who had stopped an as­sault on one of its bus driv­ers.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial ad­viser Cle­ment Tan Zhi Hao, 29, and univer­sity stu­dent Muham­mad Mu’tasim Kas­sim, 25, were each given a cer­tifi­cate and a food ham­per dur­ing the ses­sion at Tampines Bus In­ter­change.</p>
    <p>They were among three men who had in­ter­vened in the in­ci­dent on Sept 15. The third in­di­vid­ual was not present at the ses­sion as he has not been iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Sept 16, SBS Tran­sit said that a 52-year-old man had boarded ser­vice 21 along Pasir Ris Drive 6 at about 2.45pm on the day of the as­sault.</p>
    <p>The man, who put on his mask only later, be­gan hurl­ing vul­gar­i­ties at the driver and con­tin­ued to do so for the du­ra­tion of two bus stops.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit said the com­muter started phys­i­cally abus­ing the driver af­ter he stopped the bus in front of Block 210 in Pasir Ris Drive 1 to wait for the po­lice to ar­rive.</p>
    <p>That was when the three men in­ter­vened, drag­ging the as­sailant out of the bus and pin­ning him down un­til the po­lice ar­rived.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit noted i n an­other Face­book post that the in­ci­dent was one of sev­eral in the past few months where its driv­ers had been at­tacked for en­forc­ing the mask-up rule.</p>
    <p>It had close to 40 cases of pub­lic bus staff be­ing as­saulted this year, about half of which were mask-re­lated. This was up from 33 cases in the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Ja’afally Ab­dul Rahim, 52, has been charged over the Sept 15 as­sault. He is also ac­cused of car­ry­ing a knife with a 6cm-long blade dur­ing the in­ci­dent, which is an of­fence un­der the law.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Chee said that while var­i­ous mea­sures to pro­tect pub­lic trans­port work­ers f rom abuse are be­ing ex­plored, com­muters must un­der­stand that it is still wrong to ver­bally and phys­i­cally abuse them.</p>
    <p>He also said that there are proper chan­nels for un­happy com­muters to pro­vide feed­back.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit’s act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive Cheng Siak Kian said the op­er­a­tor’s bus driv­ers are trained to de-es­ca­late any sit­u­a­tion which leads to an al­ter­ca­tion be­tween com­muter and driver.</p>
    <p>There are also de­vices on the bus, such as a com­mu­ni­ca­tion sys­tem, to alert the SBS Tran­sit’s op­er­a­tions con­trol cen­tres of any bus driv­ers who are in trou­ble, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheng also said the driver has fully re­cov­ered from the as­sault and has been tem­po­rar­ily as­signed to drive an­other bus ser­vice route.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit has been help­ing the driver to pur­sue le­gal ac­tion against the as­sailant, he added.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Tan and Mr Mu’tasim said they had in­ter­vened in the as­sault with­out fear­ing for their lives.</p>
    <p>“I was think­ing if it was some­one like my loved one or my friends, I will do the same thing,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu’tasim said he was happy that the bus driver did not suf­fer any se­ri­ous in­juries.</p>
    <p>“If any­thing un­to­ward hap­pens, I be­lieve that is only the right thing, that some­one else steps up to help the per­son,” he added.</p>
    <p>RE­SPECT AND SAFE EN­VI­RON­MENT</p>
    <p>No amount of phys­i­cal bar­ri­ers can help to pro­tect the safety and dig­nity of our trans­port work­ers if the pub­lic does not sub­scribe to this im­por­tant con­cept of show­ing re­spect to our pub­lic trans­port work­ers and al­low­ing them to do their jobs (and) their du­ties in a safe en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>MR CHEE HONG TAT, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port, stress­ing that com­muters must also be­have and not re­sort to abuse.</p>
