    <p>There ap­pears to be cau­tious op­ti­mism on the prospects for the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy go­ing for­ward. While there is some jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for this, the em­pha­sis should be on the word “cau­tious”. The growth num­bers for the third quar­ter were en­cour­ag­ing. GDP was down 5.8 per cent year on year, bet­ter than the ad­vance es­ti­mates of mi­nus 7 per cent. Much of the im­prove­ment came from the 10 per cent year-on-year ex­pan­sion of the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, a sig­nif­i­cant and sur­pris­ing up­side, given that the ad­vance es­ti­mates had fore­cast only 2 per cent growth. Over­all, the econ­omy’s bet­ter-than-ex­pected per­for­mance in the third quar­ter en­abled the Govern­ment to slightly raise its pro­jec­tion of the lower bound of the econ­omy’s con­trac­tion this year to 6.5 per cent from 7 per cent.</p>
    <p>If the of­fi­cial fore­cast for pos­i­tive growth of 4 per cent to 6 per cent in 2021 ma­te­ri­alises, it will be the econ­omy’s best per­for­mance since 2011 – al­though the re­bound would be from a low base. But this fore­cast is sub­ject to ma­jor un­cer­tain­ties. The most im­por­tant is the prospect of slow­ing ex­ter­nal de­mand. With both the United States and euro zone grap­pling with new waves of Covid-19 and hav­ing to re-im­pose lock­downs, economists are slash­ing their growth fore­casts for these economies, both for the fourth quar­ter of this year and the first quar­ter of 2021. The tim­ing of any economic stim­u­lus is also un­cer­tain. In the US, there is un­likely to be any stim­u­lus un­til af­ter the inau­gu­ra­tion of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den on Jan 20, while the Euro­pean Union stim­u­lus still needs the buy-in of its mem­ber-states.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s do­mes­tic de­mand is likely to be sub­dued in the near term, with un­em­ploy­ment re­main­ing el­e­vated amid cau­tion among em­ploy­ers to ex­pand hir­ing – ex­cept in a few ar­eas such as elec­tron­ics, the med­i­cal sec­tor and e-com­merce. The prospects for tourism-re­lated ser­vices such as travel and hos­pi­tal­ity, as well as the con­ven­tion busi­ness, are also pre­car­i­ous. Their fate is not to­tally within Sin­ga­pore’s con­trol, as the eleventh-hour sus­pen­sion of the Hong Kong-Sin­ga­pore travel bub­ble – on ac­count of a sud­den surge in Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong – il­lus­trates. Op­ti­mism stem­ming from the im­mi­nent avail­abil­ity of vac­cines must also be tem­pered. A global roll-out of vac­cines will take sev­eral months at best, and their pos­i­tive im­pact on economic ac­tiv­ity will not be ap­par­ent be­fore the sec­ond half of next year.</p>
    <p>Amid these sober­ing re­al­i­ties, the best course for Sin­ga­pore will be to en­sure that it makes the most of what­ever is within its con­trol – prevent­ing the spread of in­fec­tions, help­ing busi­nesses and work­ers to adapt, and ex­tend­ing timely sup­port to those who need it. This would bet­ter the chances of the econ­omy re­vert­ing to its preCovid-19 lev­els by the end of next year.</p>
