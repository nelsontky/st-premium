    <p>Ex­actly a hun­dred years ago, on Oct 22, 1920, Cle­menceau Av­enue was in­au­gu­rated. A few weeks af­ter re­sign­ing as prime min­is­ter of France, Ge­orges Cle­menceau – the se­nior states­man, de­fender of Re­pub­li­can val­ues also known as the Tiger and the Fa­ther of Vic­tory – graced one of the big­gest ar­ter­ies of Sin­ga­pore then with his name.</p>
    <p>He at­tended in per­son the cer­e­mony more than 10,000km away from his home coun­try.</p>
    <p>It was an in­vi­ta­tion of the ma­haraja of Bikaner that led Cle­menceau to em­bark on his trav­els through Asia, from Cey­lon to In­done­sia, from then Burma to In­dia, a jour­ney that would take him to Sin­ga­pore on two oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>By then he was 79 and had just left po­lit­i­cal life af­ter two years at the head of the French gov­ern­ment, two years that brought France to vic­tory in</p>
    <p>World War I and then peace, two years dur­ing which he had to con­front un­prece­dented storms, in­clud­ing the Span­ish flu epi­demic. A physi­cian by train­ing, Cle­menceau un­flinch­ingly held the helm and steered the ship of state to safety. When he even­tu­ally stepped down, he left France vic­to­ri­ous and re­silient.</p>
    <p>Pas­sion­ate about Asian arts and civil­i­sa­tions, Cle­menceau wanted to see with his own eyes the Eastern world that had fas­ci­nated him so much. He left on his voy­age from Mar­seille as an or­di­nary French cit­i­zen and was re­ceived in Sin­ga­pore as a head of state.</p>
    <p>Cle­menceau had read Con­fu­cius and stud­ied Bud­dhism, col­lected en­grav­ings, masks and ce­ram­ics, but it was the first time he was trav­el­ling to the ori­gins of such mar­vels.</p>
    <p>While in Sin­ga­pore, he vis­ited tem­ples and schools, wan­dered in Chi­na­town, guided by Dr Lim Boon Keng, a for­mer min­is­ter of the Repub­lic of China and a friend of Sun Yat-sen’s. He dis­cov­ered the an­ces­tral trea­sures of Sin­ga­pore and its more con­tem­po­rary re­al­i­ties, its po­lit­i­cal con­text and its al­ready dy­namic ar­chi­tec­ture and econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Cle­menceau was a fighter of trench war­fare and a staunch de­fender of French ter­ri­tory but also a lover of greater hori­zons. He grew up by the At­lantic Ocean, sailed away at 24 to the United States, where he spent sev­eral years of his life and, in its twi­light, made the most of his new­found free­dom to dis­cover Africa and Asia. His po­lit­i­cal life was nur­tured by this tire­less cu­rios­ity.</p>
    <p>In his time in pub­lic of­fice, the French Par­lia­ment rang with his im­pas­sioned pleas against colo­nial­ism and the con­cept of race, as well as his praise for the great­ness of Asian civil­i­sa­tions. His in­ter­ac­tions with Asia also took place in the diplo­matic realm – in 1911 he wel­comed Dr Sun to</p>
    <p>Paris and in 1919 he ne­go­ti­ated with the Chi­nese and Ja­panese en­voys the Peace of Ver­sailles, in the same palace where Louis XIV had re­ceived the first em­bassy of Siam in 1684.</p>
    <p>Cle­menceau left his mark on the long his­tory that France and Asia have in com­mon, and which we go on writ­ing af­ter him. His ex­am­ple in­vites us to look for peace through di­a­logue be­tween na­tions and civil­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The bal­ance Cle­menceau ad­vo­cated for, be­tween in­de­pen­dence and sol­i­dar­ity, is more rel­e­vant than ever now and lies at the core of France’s ac­tions, guid­ing it amid the tur­moils of to­day’s world.</p>
    <p>It is re­flected in France’s role as a de­vel­op­ment part­ner of Asean, the cen­tral or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Indo-Pa­cific, and is a ma­te­rial ex­pres­sion of our sol­i­dar­ity. Con­tribut­ing to the peace and se­cu­rity of the re­gion, fos­ter­ing trust, pro­mot­ing mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and an as­tute man­age­ment of global pub­lic goods – these are ac­tions that favour a vir­tu­ous in­de­pen­dence and en­sures the rich­ness of our ex­changes.</p>
    <p>The vOi­lah! France Sin­ga­pore Fes­ti­val 2020, a high­light in the strate­gic part­ner­ship be­tween our two coun­tries, will be an op­por­tu­nity to re­mem­ber the con­tin­ued rel­e­vance of Cle­menceau’s legacy. The fes­ti­val will be­gin with a rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the play, The Veil Of Hap­pi­ness, which will be broad­cast on­line to­day. It is a beau­ti­ful tes­ti­mony of the mu­tual en­rich­ment be­tween cul­tures: a French play, with a Chi­nese sto­ry­line, en­acted in English and broad­cast si­mul­ta­ne­ously world­wide.</p>
    <p>An ex­hi­bi­tion – Cle­menceau In Sin­ga­pore – to in­tro­duce the char­ac­ter be­hind the av­enue, the man be­hind the name, will be on from to­mor­row un­til Nov 22 at the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore – which Cle­menceau once vis­ited. A con­fer­ence to­mor­row about his meet­ing with Dr Lim, and the causes they both cham­pi­oned, will bring to­gether French his­to­rian Jean-Noel Jeanneney, a Cle­menceau ex­pert, and Dr Kevin Tan, a spe­cial­ist in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>In this year of new chal­lenges and new be­gin­nings, we will suc­ceed only by join­ing forces, and I have no doubt that these com­mem­o­ra­tions of the Tiger in the city of the Lion will be for us, French and Sin­ga­porean alike, a source of in­spi­ra­tion and hope.</p>
