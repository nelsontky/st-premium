    <p>For seven years, the aroma of cof­fee has per­me­ated most of Mr Mar­cus Foo’s wak­ing hours.</p>
    <p>Since 2013, the 39-year-old co­founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of PPP Cof­fee has been sup­ply­ing lo­cally roasted cof­fee beans to home-grown busi­nesses, con­duct­ing guided tours and over­see­ing barista train­ing work­shops.</p>
    <p>“Our mis­sion has al­ways been con­nect­ing peo­ple and the com­mu­nity through cof­fee,” Mr Foo told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>PPP Cof­fee owns and op­er­ates Chye Seng Huat Hardware eatery, which will host work­shops on cof­fee brew­ing as part of the My Com­mu­nity Fes­ti­val (MCF).</p>
    <p>The MCF will take place in var­i­ous lo­ca­tions this year, from Dec 4 to 20. In view of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, events will have smaller group sizes to com­ply with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. Some events will also be avail­able on­line.</p>
    <p>My Com­mu­nity, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion es­tab­lished in 2010, has been or­gan­is­ing her­itage tours in his­toric neigh­bour­hoods such as Queen­stown and Tiong Bahru since its in­cep­tion. With this year’s fes­ti­val, it is ex­pand­ing its list of part­ners to broad­cast sto­ries from more neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek Li Yong, who co­founded My Com­mu­nity when he was 20, said: “Every com­mu­nity has a story to tell. We want to nar­rate sto­ries of the com­mon peo­ple and cel­e­brate the lit­tle things in our neigh­bour­hood.”</p>
    <p>The MCF events fall into six cat­e­gories: Makan My Curry; After Hours @ My Com­mu­nity; Meet My Crafts­man; Of Rites and Rit­u­als; One Bean, Many Cof­fees; and Open My Fac­tory. These were fi­nalised after a year-long plan­ning process by Mr Kwek and his col­leagues.</p>
    <p>Ms Nicky Kamhaengna, 38, wel­comed the chance to par­tic­i­pate in the MCF. She will be cook­ing Thai cur­ries un­der the Makan My Curry seg­ment, in her own kitchen. The housewife is a mem­ber of the Thai As­so­ci­a­tion, one of many part­ners work­ing with My Com­mu­nity. She wants to in­tro­duce var­i­ous Thai dishes, par­tic­u­larly the ubiq­ui­tous sweet green curry, to par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>An­other My Com­mu­nity part­ner is Mrs In­dra Iswaran, 71, who will cook Sri Lankan Jaffna cur­ries at her home for event par­tic­i­pants. She told ST that Jaffna Tamil cur­ries have more co­conut in them than South In­dian ones.</p>
    <p>Ms Kamhaengna and Mrs Iswaran said they were de­lighted when My Com­mu­nity reached out to part­ner with them.</p>
    <p>Ms Kamhaengna said she hoped peo­ple would leave her tast­ing event feel­ing “warm and wel­comed as a good friend”, while Mrs Iswaran said the fes­ti­val could “pre­serve the lega­cies that are slowly be­ing for­got­ten”.</p>
    <p>Be­sides tast­ing food, par­tic­i­pants can meet lo­cal crafts­men prac­tis­ing tra­di­tional arts and visit var­i­ous places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>MCF will also give them a chance to visit places that are usu­ally in­ac­ces­si­ble. For in­stance, After Hours @ Changi fea­tures ke­longs that are usu­ally re­stricted to the public. And vis­i­tors to the SingPost Dis­tri­bu­tion Cen­tre (un­der Open My Fac­tory) will have a be­hind-the-scenes glimpse of the mail room.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val was orig­i­nally planned to start in April but was moved to next month, with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place, ow­ing to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion for MCF pro­grammes will open at 8pm to­mor­row at my­commu­ni­tyfes­ti­val.sg</p>
