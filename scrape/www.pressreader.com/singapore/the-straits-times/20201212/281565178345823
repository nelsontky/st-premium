    <p>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies Sanofi and Glax­oSmithK­line (GSK) said yes­ter­day that their ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 vac­cine did not ap­pear to gen­er­ate a good im­mune re­sponse in older adults, a sig­nif­i­cant set­back to their late-stage clin­i­cal trial. The part­ners will be­gin a new study with a more con­cen­trated prod­uct in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>With this type of vac­cine, the re­sult is not a sur­prise: We know that more anti­gen is needed in older pa­tients. But when in Phase 1 and 2, drug mak­ers test tol­er­ance and one can­not test strong dosages. I would think Sanofi and GSK will be able to im­prove their vac­cine.</p>
    <p>DR JEAN-DANIEL LELIEVRE, head of clinic im­munol­ogy and in­fec­tious dis­eases at Henri-Mon­dor Hos­pi­tal in Creteil, France.</p>
    <p>PARIS • Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies Sanofi and Glax­oSmithK­line (GSK) yes­ter­day said their ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 vac­cine did not ap­pear to work well in older adults, a sig­nif­i­cant set­back to their lat­estage clin­i­cal trial that was pre­vi­ously ex­pected to be­gin in the United States this month.</p>
    <p>The part­ners will be­gin a new Phase 2 study with a more con­cen­trated prod­uct in Fe­bru­ary, af­ter the cur­rent dosage failed to gen­er­ate a good im­mune re­sponse in peo­ple 50 years and older. If the data is pos­i­tive, a global Phase 3 study could start in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>The pair are also look­ing at do­ing a head-to-head trial with an ap­proved Covid-19 vac­cine to try to speed up re­search.</p>
    <p>De­lays and ad­di­tional tri­als are not un­usual, but the Sanofi-GSK an­nounce­ment high­lights the unique set of chal­lenges fac­ing drug mak­ers in multi-task­ing sci­ence, speed and lo­gis­tics dur­ing a pan­demic that has crushed global economies.</p>
    <p>The set­back af­fects one of the most es­tab­lished tech­nolo­gies in vac­cines – used against the hu­man pa­pil­lo­mavirus, hep­ati­tis B and per­tus­sis, among other pathogens – which aims to in­tro­duce lab-made pro­teins into the body to prod the im­mune sys­tem into de­vel­op­ing a tar­geted de­fence against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It ce­ments the lead of more novel ap­proaches used by vac­cines from the likes of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which de­ploy mRNA ge­netic tech­nol­ogy to trick the body into pro­duc­ing those pro­teins. Both of those shots were found to be about 95 per cent ef­fec­tive in suc­cess­ful large-scale tri­als. It un­der­scores why gov­ern­ments have spread their bets by se­cur­ing shots from dif­fer­ent de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>Sanofi said re­sults from phases one and two tri­als showed “an im­mune re­sponse com­pa­ra­ble to pa­tients who re­cov­ered from Covid-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a low im­mune re­sponse in older adults likely due to an in­suf­fi­cient con­cen­tra­tion of the anti­gen”.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine’s po­ten­tial avail­abil­ity has been pushed back “from mid-2021 to Q4 2021”, the drug­mak­ers said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Jean-Daniel Lelievre, head of clinic im­munol­ogy and in­fec­tious dis­eases at Henri-Mon­dor Hos­pi­tal in Creteil, France, said: “With this type of vac­cine, the re­sult is not a sur­prise: We know that more anti­gen is needed in older pa­tients. But when in Phase 1 and 2, drug mak­ers test tol­er­ance and one can­not test strong dosages.”</p>
    <p>He added: “I would think Sanofi and GSK will be able to im­prove their vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate devel­op­ment, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant As­traZeneca’s Rus­sian branch said yes­ter­day that it would test a com­bi­na­tion of its ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 vac­cine with Rus­sia’s home­made Sput­nik V vac­cine in fur­ther clin­i­cal tri­als, a ma­jor sign of recog­ni­tion for a jab that has been viewed with scep­ti­cism by the West.</p>
    <p>Tri­als will start by the end of the year and Rus­sia wants to jointly pro­duce the new vac­cine if it is proven to be ef­fec­tive, said the RDIF wealth fund, which funded Sput­nik V. The vac­cine is named af­ter the Soviet-era satel­lite that trig­gered the space race.</p>
    <p>While the Sput­nik V jab uses hu­man ade­n­ovirus vec­tors, As­traZeneca’s AZD1222 re­lies on ade­n­ovirus from chim­panzees. Both are ad­min­is­tered in two doses.</p>
    <p>The part­ner­ship came about when the de­vel­op­ers of Sput­nik V sug­gested on Twit­ter last month that As­traZeneca try the com­bi­na­tion af­ter the Bri­tish drug maker re­leased in­terim re­sults from its lat­estage trial. The Bri­tish drug maker ac­cepted the pro­posal, the RFID said yes­ter­day.</p>
