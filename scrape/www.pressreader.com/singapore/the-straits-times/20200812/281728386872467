    <p>MOSCOW • Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin said yes­ter­day that Rus­sia had be­come the first coun­try in the world to grant reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to a Covid-19 vac­cine af­ter less than two months of hu­man test­ing, a move hailed by Moscow as ev­i­dence of its sci­en­tific prow­ess.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ment paves the way for the mass in­oc­u­la­tion of the Rus­sian pop­u­la­tion, even as the fi­nal stage of clin­i­cal tri­als to test safety and ef­fi­cacy con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>The speed at which Rus­sia is mov­ing to roll out its vac­cine high­lights its de­ter­mi­na­tion to win the global race for an ef­fec­tive prod­uct, but has stirred con­cerns that the coun­try may be putting national pres­tige be­fore sound sci­ence and safety.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a gov­ern­ment meet­ing on state tele­vi­sion, Mr Putin said the vac­cine, de­vel­oped by Moscow’s Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute, was safe and that it had even been ad­min­is­tered to one of his daugh­ters.</p>
    <p>“I know that it works quite ef­fec­tively, forms strong im­mu­nity, and I repeat, it has passed all the needed checks,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that he hoped the coun­try would soon start masspro­duc­ing the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) and the Rus­sian health au­thor­i­ties are dis­cussing the process for pos­si­ble WHO pre-qual­i­fi­ca­tion for the vac­cine, a WHO spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte ac­cepted Rus­sia’s of­fer of its coro­n­avirus vac­cine, vol­un­teer­ing to take the first shot as a ges­ture of trust and grat­i­tude.</p>
    <p>“When the vac­cine ar­rives, I will have my­self in­jected in public. Ex­per­i­ment on me first, that’s fine with me,” he said in a brief­ing on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte added that Manila can as­sist Moscow in clin­i­cal tri­als and lo­cal pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, China’s Si­no­vac Biotech launched a late-stage hu­man trial yes­ter­day that will in­volve as many as 1,620 pa­tients for a Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date that it is de­vel­op­ing with In­done­sian state-owned peer Bio Farma.</p>
    <p>Separately, Si­no­vac re­leased de­tails on Mon­day from a mid­stage, or Phase II, study in which it said the vac­cine can­di­date ap­peared to be safe and in­duced de­tectable an­ti­body-based i mmune re­sponses in sub­jects.</p>
    <p>The can­di­date – known as Coron­aVac – is among a few po­ten­tial vac­cines that have en­tered late-stage tri­als for a largescale study to gather proof of ef­fi­cacy for reg­u­la­tory ap­proval.</p>
    <p>“The threat of Covid-19 will not sub­side un­til a vac­cine is given to all the peo­ple,” said In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo at a cer­e­mony to launch the trial in Ban­dung, West Java.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully in Jan­uary, we can pro­duce (the vac­cine) and vac­ci­nate ev­ery­one in the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The speed at which Rus­sia is mov­ing to roll out its vac­cine high­lights its de­ter­mi­na­tion to win the global race for an ef­fec­tive prod­uct, but has stirred con­cerns that the coun­try may be putting national pres­tige be­fore sound sci­ence and safety... Mr Putin said the vac­cine, de­vel­oped by Moscow’s Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute, was safe and that it had even been ad­min­is­tered to one of his daugh­ters.</p>
