    <p>With no stay­ing races avail­able, Sin­ga­porean trainer Desmond Koh has en­tered his four-time win­ner Luck Of Mas­ter in to­day’s $70,000 Kranji Stakes C event over the Poly­track 1,600m.</p>
    <p>The $1 mil­lion Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Gold Cup over 2,000m last Novem­ber was Koh’s bench­mark for the Luck Of Friend­ship Sta­ble-owned six year-old, but he was the sec­ond emer­gency ac­cep­tor and did not get a start.</p>
    <p>He ran in a Kranji Stakes C race over the Gold Cup dis­tance on the same day. He came from be­hind to fin­ish a smack-up fifth to Time Lord, af­ter rac­ing wide.</p>
    <p>This was fol­lowed by his lastto-sev­enth out­ing in the $150,000 Group 3 Colo­nial Chief Stakes over the Poly 1,600m. His rider lost the use of his off-side reins for a short dis­tance pass­ing 350m mark.</p>
    <p>To Koh, to­day’s 1,600m is well short of the Hong Kong-owned chest­nut’s best. But, with no stay­ing races com­ing up soon, prefer­ably on turf, it is a bet­ter op­tion than stay­ing in his box.</p>
    <p>“He’s a pure 2,000m horse and we wanted him to get a start to see where he fits against that Gold Cup bench­mark,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to see if he could mix it with the best stay­ers Kranji has to of­fer. But, un­for­tu­nately, he didn’t get in and we fell back on the Colo­nial Chief Stakes in­stead.</p>
    <p>“His run was not so bad. He didn’t dis­ap­point, but be­cause there was noth­ing else for him, I’m giv­ing him an­other run over the same course and dis­tance in that Kranji Stakes C race.</p>
    <p>“He races more of­ten on turf and I would think he’s more of a turf horse, but he’s won once over the Poly­track mile.”</p>
    <p>That win in a Class 4 event came on Jan 4 last year, when Luck Of Mas­ter pro­duced a quick turn of foot for jockey Benny Wood­worth to score go­ing away.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, that was the only time the top Malaysian jockey has rid­den Luck Of Mas­ter in 14 starts. Noh Se­nari has won twice on the horse and Wong Chin Chuen once.</p>
    <p>In the old days, Koh forged a for­mi­da­ble al­liance with Wood­worth for many years. Phenom’s win in the 2008 Group 1 Pa­tron’s Bowl was their great­est re­sult.</p>
    <p>“Benny and I go back a long way. If I get the op­por­tu­nity and he’s free, I will al­ways sup­port him,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Benny has won on Luck Of Mas­ter and he knows the horse. I don’t have to tell him how to ride the horse. From bar­rier one, he won’t be as far back, but it doesn’t re­ally mat­ter where he draws, he will run on strongly.”</p>
