    <p>WASHINGTON The United States Jus­tice De­part­ment is in­ves­ti­gat­ing a po­ten­tial crime re­lated to fun­nelling money to the White House in ex­change for a pres­i­den­tial par­don, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments un­sealed in fed­eral court.</p>
    <p>US Dis­trict Judge Beryl How­ell on Tues­day re­leased a heav­ily redacted or­der that de­scribed what she called a “bribery-for-par­don” in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>About half of the 18-page doc­u­ment was blacked out, with the pub­licly avail­able ver­sion pro­vid­ing few de­tails of the al­leged scheme and nam­ing none of the peo­ple po­ten­tially in­volved.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the doc­u­ment, fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors in Washington said they had ob­tained ev­i­dence of a bribery scheme in which some­one “would of­fer a sub­stan­tial po­lit­i­cal con­tri­bu­tion in ex­change for a pres­i­den­tial par­don or re­prieve of sen­tence”.</p>
    <p>The or­der said pros­e­cu­tors were also in­ves­ti­gat­ing a “se­cret lob­by­ing scheme” in which two uniden­ti­fied in­di­vid­u­als “acted as lob­by­ists to se­nior White House of­fi­cials, with­out com­ply­ing with the reg­is­tra­tion re­quire­ment of the Lob­by­ing Dis­clo­sure Act”.</p>
    <p>The Jus­tice De­part­ment had to ask Jus­tice How­ell’s per­mis­sion to view cer­tain e-mails be­tween a lawyer and clients, who were not iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The judge granted the re­quest in Au­gust, say­ing at­tor­ney-client priv­i­lege did not ap­ply in that in­stance.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors had said they planned to “con­front” three un­named in­di­vid­u­als with the com­mu­ni­ca­tions and fin­ish their in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Jus­tice How­ell’s or­der, gov­ern­ment in­ves­ti­ga­tors said they had seized “over 50 dig­i­tal me­dia de­vices, in­clud­ing iPhones, iPads, lap­tops, thumb drives, and com­puter and external hard drives”.</p>
    <p>A Jus­tice De­part­ment spokesman did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dents en­joy wide lat­i­tude un­der the US Con­sti­tu­tion in par­don­ing peo­ple con­victed of fed­eral crimes.</p>
    <p>Last week, Pres­i­dent Don­ald</p>
    <p>Trump par­doned his for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to ly­ing to the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion dur­ing the in</p>
    <p>ves­ti­ga­tion into Rus­sian med­dling in the 2016 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>That was the first of what is ex­pected to be a string of par­dons in Mr Trump’s fi­nal weeks in the</p>
    <p>White House.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Jus­tice How­ell’s or­der, the Jus­tice De­part­ment had re­cently told her it wanted to keep the in­ves­ti­ga­tion from be­com­ing pub­lic be­cause it de­tailed “in­di­vid­u­als and con­duct” that had not yet been charged.</p>
    <p>Still, the un­sealed doc­u­ments of­fered a few clues about what the White House may have known about the scheme.</p>
    <p>One pas­sage ap­pears to show that a lawyer for a con­vict had dis­cus­sions with the White House Coun­sel’s Of­fice about a par­don or com­mu­ta­tion, but it was un­clear whether the dis­cus­sions were part of the scheme or a nor­mal backand-forth with the White House about a con­vict’s case.</p>
    <p>Late on Tues­day, Mr Trump used Twit­ter to briefly ad­dress the dis­clo­sure of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, calling it “fake news”.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors sus­pected the con­vict seek­ing the par­don was im­pris­oned as re­cently as this sum­mer, and that two peo­ple work­ing on be­half of the con­vict may have un­der­taken a se­cret lob­by­ing campaign by ap­proach­ing White House of­fi­cials, ac­cord­ing to the doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The two peo­ple may have of­fered to fun­nel money as po­lit­i­cal do­na­tions in ex­change for the par­don or com­mu­ta­tion, al­though it was un­clear where the money was sup­posed to be sent.</p>
    <p>Given Mr Trump’s undis­ci­plined ap­proach to par­dons, the dis­clo­sure – com­ing amid a flurry of re­ports about how he has been dis­cussing whether to par­don his chil­dren and close con­fi­dants in the fi­nal weeks of his pres­i­dency – raised fears that the par­don process may have been cor­rupted.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has had talks with his per­sonal lawyer Rudy Gi­u­liani last week about a pre-emp­tive par­don for Mr Gi­u­liani be­fore he leaves of­fice.</p>
