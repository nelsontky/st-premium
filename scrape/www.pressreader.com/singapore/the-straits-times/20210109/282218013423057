    <p>Guide­lines to pro­mote healthy lifestyle habits were launched yes­ter­day af­ter it was found that young peo­ple spent too much time on screen view­ing, got in­ad­e­quate sleep and did not ex­er­cise enough.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines give par­ents and chil­dren step-by-step sug­ges­tions on how to strike a bal­ance be­tween us­ing de­vices like phones and lap­tops, and un­der­tak­ing more phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>They stem from in­ter­na­tional guide­lines and a KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH) sur­vey, which polled 100 par­ents of chil­dren aged five to 14, in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The poll found that 43 per cent did not do any vig­or­ous phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity, while 32 per cent did not en­gage in any mod­er­ate ac­tiv­ity. This was cou­pled with seden­tary be­hav­iour, with 25 per cent spend­ing more than 10 wak­ing hours a day seated for pro­longed pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the chil­dren were also spend­ing too much time on their screens; 20 per cent clocked more than four hours a day, dou­ble the rec­om­mended amount.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also found that 70 per cent of the par­ents polled were con­cerned about their chil­dren’s screen time, yet 41 per cent were un­aware of the rec­om­mended screen hours.</p>
    <p>These in­sights prompted health­care pro­fes­sion­als to de­velop a set of guide­lines for daily ac­tiv­i­ties over a 24-hour pe­riod.</p>
    <p>One guide­line en­cour­ages chil­dren to en­gage in a va­ri­ety of light phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties through­out the day and to un­der­take an av­er­age of</p>
    <p>one hour of mod­er­ate-to-vig­or­ous ac­tiv­ity each day in a week.</p>
    <p>The new rec­om­men­da­tions, which com­ple­ment guide­lines es­tab­lished in 2013 on phys­i­cal and seden­tary be­hav­iours among chil­dren and ado­les­cents, also in­clude re­cent re­search on the ef­fec­tive­ness of prac­tis­ing light phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity and adopt­ing good eat­ing and sleep­ing habits.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines were launched at the Asia Pa­cific Ma­ter­nal and Child Meta­bolic Health Con­fer­ence and In­te­grated Plat­form for Re­search in Ad­vanc­ing Meta­bolic Health Out­comes of Women and Chil­dren (IPRAMHO) In­ter­na­tional Meet­ing 2021 at KKH.</p>
    <p>Dr Benny Loo, consultant at KKH’s gen­eral pae­di­atrics and</p>
    <p>sports medicine ser­vices and chair­man of the guide­lines’ work­group, said at the event: “Re­search shows that adopt­ing healthy lifestyle habits at a young age sets the stage for be­com­ing healthy adults, re­duc­ing risks for meta­bolic dis­eases such as heart dis­ease, di­a­betes mel­li­tus and obe­sity.</p>
    <p>“This set of guide­lines helps to pro­mote a struc­tured and com­pre­hen­sive ap­proach in or­gan­is­ing a child’s 24-hour day of phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties, seden­tary time and sleep, to op­ti­mise his or her health out­comes in the long run.”</p>
    <p>The guide­lines will be pro­vided to health­care providers, who can then di­rect the ap­pro­pri­ate op­tions to their pa­tients, he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Loo said that pro­vid­ing a time­frame of 24 hours helps to in­cul­cate chil­dren with the idea that these are small, daily steps that they have to take to reach the goal of a health­ier life.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines were de­vel­oped by a work­group com­pris­ing the KKH-led IPRAMHO and Col­lege of Pae­di­atrics and Child Health in the Academy of Medicine Sin­ga­pore, in part­ner­ship with Ex­er­cise is Medicine Sin­ga­pore, the Sports Medicine As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore, Peri­na­tal So­ci­ety of Sin­ga­pore, Sin­ga­pore Pae­di­atric So­ci­ety, Col­lege of Fam­ily Physi­cians Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore Medicine As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tor Mis­lia Su­par, 45, said the preva­lence of e-learn­ing has made it dif­fi­cult to man­age the screen time of her three chil­dren, aged six, 10 and 11.</p>
    <p>She hopes the guide­lines can help her kids to strike a bal­ance be­tween e-learn­ing and leisure time on their de­vices, and al­low them to un­der­stand the im­pact of hav­ing too much screen time.</p>
