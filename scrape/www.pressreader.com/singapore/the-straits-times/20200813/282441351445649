    <p>Like many of their South-east Asian ri­vals, the na­tional men’s wa­ter polo team faced sev­eral chal­lenges as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic, chief among them cir­cuit breaker mea­sures that saw the ath­letes be­ing un­able to train in the swim­ming pool.</p>
    <p>But these hur­dles will not stop them from re­turn­ing to the top of the SEA Games podium in Viet­nam next year, in­sisted Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) vice-pres­i­dent (wa­ter polo) Do­minic Soh.</p>
    <p>Since suf­fer­ing heart­break at the bi­en­nial Games in the Philip­pines last year, when the men’s team were beaten to gold for the first time at the bi­en­nial event, Sin­ga­pore wa­ter polo has been re­build­ing for next year’s cam­paign.</p>
    <p>With sports fa­cil­i­ties closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, ath­letes adapted by do­ing “wa­ter polo-spe­cific” ex­er­cises at home such as push­ing off the wall to sim­u­late shak­ing off an op­po­nent. Soh said: “We still have that same con­fi­dence (of re­gain­ing gold). Ev­ery­one in the world is af­fected. We’re all at the same start­ing line.</p>
    <p>“With the team be­ing larger, you also have more op­tions in terms of how to choose the team make-up, so that raises con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>To build ca­ma­raderie and com­mu­ni­ca­tion within the team and among play­ers, the coach and of­fi­cials, they also de­cided to in­volve ath­letes in the se­lec­tion of their team lead­ers.</p>
    <p>While the cap­tain and vice-cap­tain were pre­vi­ously ap­pointed by of­fi­cials, play­ers can now nom­i­nate one cap­tain and two vice-cap­tains ac­cord­ing to cer­tain cri­te­ria for as­sess­ment by team of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>“This will re­ally help in ral­ly­ing the team to­gether and build­ing the team’s bond, there­fore grow­ing the strength of the team,” added Soh.</p>
    <p>The 59-year-old will re­turn un­op­posed for his sec­ond two-year term at the SSA’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ing next Thurs­day. Nom­i­na­tions for its ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee po­si­tions closed on Aug 5 with no con­tests for all 10 po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to re­claim­ing the men’s wa­ter polo SEA Games gold, his other pri­or­i­ties are to con­tinue strength­en­ing the youth de­vel­op­ment sys­tem and im­prove the qual­ity of coach­ing here.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing how there were no se­lec­tion tri­als for the 2018 Asian Games with only 13 play­ers, Soh said the na­tional youth de­vel­op­ment squad’s for­ma­tion when he took of­fice that year was aimed at groom­ing male and fe­male play­ers to be ready for the se­nior teams.</p>
    <p>Also on the cards is a more com­pre­hen­sive pro­gramme to en­sure a smoother and more ef­fec­tive tran­si­tion from the de­vel­op­ment squad to the se­nior teams. This in­cludes pay­ing closer at­ten­tion to each player’s progress via a jour­nal that tracks their de­vel­op­ment, with coaches pro­vid­ing ad­vice and guid­ance.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that there was no for­malised sys­tem pre­vi­ously as they re­lied on the “hand-me-down” per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ences of coaches who were for­mer na­tional play­ers, Soh said that this is cru­cial to en­sure con­ti­nu­ity and main­tain stan­dards.</p>
    <p>“Through this struc­tured process, we hope to in­crease the rate of suc­cess with re­gard to pro­duc­ing high­qual­ity play­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>Soh will be aided in his quest by Lee Thin Cheong, who is set to re­place Ang Ban Leong as as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral of wa­ter polo.</p>
    <p>SSA pres­i­dent Lee Kok Choy said Lee’s ad­di­tion is a boon for the team, adding: “Thin Cheong has been team man­ager for the men’s wa­ter polo team since 2014 and was a for­mer na­tional player him­self.</p>
    <p>“Given the fact he’s will­ing to com­mit ex­tra ef­fort and time, un­der­stands the di­rec­tion of our wa­ter polo (ef­forts) and works very well with Do­minic, he’s a very good as­set to the team.”</p>
    <p>GOOD SYS­TEM NEEDED</p>
    <p>It’s al­ways dif­fi­cult to main­tain con­ti­nu­ity by just hand-me-down ex­pe­ri­ences, we need to put in place sys­tems... and if you don’t en­sure that con­ti­nu­ity, you’ll find that the qual­ity will de­te­ri­o­rate. Through this struc­tured process, we hope to in­crease the rate of suc­cess with re­gard to pro­duc­ing high-qual­ity play­ers.’’</p>
    <p>DO­MINIC SOH, SSA vice-pres­i­dent, on the im­por­tance of con­ti­nu­ity.</p>
