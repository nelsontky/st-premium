    <p>Straits Times Opin­ion Ed­i­tor Chua Mui Hoong rightly points out that the Work­ers’ Party (WP) may have won over many younger vot­ers and mid­dle-class house­holds. How­ever, she is too quick to dis­miss the other op­po­si­tion par­ties’ per­for­mance (A re­sult that could please vot­ers from both sides, July 11).</p>
    <p>She did not suf­fi­ciently dis­cuss the po­ten­tial chal­lenges that the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) brings to the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP). Here are three rea­sons why PSP and not just WP should be con­sid­ered lead­ing op­po­si­tion par­ties in Sin­ga­pore:</p>
    <p>First, WP and PSP came within strik­ing dis­tance of clinch­ing East Coast and West Coast GRCs. We can­not be sure the PAP would have re­tained those seats had it not in­tro­duced heavy­weight min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the PSP caused the big­gest down­ward swings in the PAP’s con­stituency vote share in the PAP’s tra­di­tional vote banks in the west of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>While PSP pulled the PAP vote share in West Coast GRC down by nearly 27 per­cent­age points, it also re­duced the PAP vote share by 18 points in Chua Chu Kang GRC and more than 14 per­cent­age points in Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC. Hong Kah North SMC and Pi­o­neer SMC also pre­sented down­ward swings of more than 12.5 points for the PAP.</p>
    <p>Third, all PSP-con­tested wards pre­sented lower pro­por­tions of spoilt votes com­pared with the na­tion­wide statis­tic of 1.8 per cent of all votes be­ing spoilt. The same goes for WP. More spoilt votes would sug­gest more vot­ers re­ject the in­cum­bents but do not have con­fi­dence in the chal­lengers.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Radin Mas SMC had the high­est spoilt vote pro­por­tion of 3.47 per cent when vot­ers had to choose be­tween a PAP can­di­date and a Re­form Party can­di­date who did not show up to record his own tele­vised con­stituency broad­cast.</p>
    <p>We may con­clude that there is rea­son­ably strong in­ter­est from cit­i­zens in the PSP’s main talk­ing points of ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency from the Gov­ern­ment. Not bad, con­sid­er­ing how new the PSP is.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing party founder Tan Cheng Bock pulls off a con­vinc­ing strat­egy to de­velop the PSP so it can ex­pand its out­reach, field even bet­ter can­di­dates, present a broader and higher-qual­ity man­i­festo, and, most cru­cially, en­sure the party can sur­vive af­ter he leaves, the PSP may form a third pole in Sin­ga­porean elec­toral pol­i­tics.</p>
