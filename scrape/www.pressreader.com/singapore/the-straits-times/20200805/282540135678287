    <p>The Kiss­ing Booth, the 2018 teenage ro­man­tic com­edy by Net­flix, is a prime ex­am­ple of when crit­ics and au­di­ences ve­he­mently dis­agree.</p>
    <p>The film did not sit well with re­view­ers, whose ag­gre­gated cri­tiques gave it an abysmal score of 17 per cent on Rot­ten To­ma­toes.</p>
    <p>But it was a re­sound­ing suc­cess for the plat­form, which said it was one of its most watched movies in the United States and the world that year.</p>
    <p>And one in three view­ers watched it a sec­ond time, which is 30 per cent higher than Net­flix’s av­er­age re­watch rate.</p>
    <p>As they reprise their roles in the newly re­leased The Kiss­ing Booth 2, stars Joey King and Joel Court­ney un­pack the in­gre­di­ents be­hind the first film’s suc­cess – and sug­gest it won view­ers over be­cause of a joy­ful­ness and en­ergy that harken back to clas­sic 1980s rom­coms.</p>
    <p>And they think the se­quel hits many of the same notes, which may ex­plain why it is among Net­flix’s top three ti­tles in the United States – and top 10 in Sin­ga­pore – this week.</p>
    <p>In the orig­i­nal, based on The Kiss­ing Booth books by Beth Reek­les, the friend­ship be­tween best pals Elle (King) and Lee (Court­ney) is im­per­illed when Elle falls for high­school bad boy Noah (Ja­cob Elordi).</p>
    <p>This is be­cause Noah is Lee’s brother and off lim­its, ac­cord­ing to the rules of Lee and Elle’s friend­ship pact.</p>
    <p>In the se­quel, it is Elle and Noah’s re­la­tion­ship in jeop­ardy as Noah jets off to Har­vard and the cou­ple try to make things work in a longdis­tance re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Al­though crit­ics took the movie to task for ped­dling rom­com as well as sex­ist cliches, it is one of the few ti­tles in the genre cen­tred on a gen­uinely pla­tonic friend­ship be­tween a girl and a boy.</p>
    <p>And in a re­cent Zoom in­ter­view, King and Court­ney ap­pear to be just as fond of each other as their char­ac­ters, of­ten stop­ping to tease and make each other laugh.</p>
    <p>But un­like Lee and Elle, there are no hard and fast rules re­gard­ing their own pla­tonic re­la­tion­ship, says Court­ney, 24.</p>
    <p>“Our friend­ship is one of a kind,” ex­plains the ac­tor, who ap­peared in the sci­ence-fic­tion film Su­per 8 (2011). “Hon­estly, we just laugh. Laugh­ter is the main theme of our friend­ship. When­ever we hang out, that’s the most mem­o­rable thing.”</p>
    <p>It was “pure ela­tion and ex­cite­ment” when the duo learnt they were team­ing up again for the se­quel, says King, 21.</p>
    <p>“And a huge part of that was get­ting to work with Joel again. We just had so much fun on the first movie. Every time we get to­gether, it’s just ab­so­lute chaos and ridicu­lous­ness and so much laugh­ter.”</p>
    <p>“We’ve spent a lot of time to­gether, and you go through a lot of things work-wise and also per­son­ally. So be­ing a sup­port sys­tem for each other is some­thing I’m re­ally thank­ful for,” says the ac­tress, who ap­peared in the hor­ror film The Con­jur­ing (2013).</p>
    <p>As for the suc­cess of The Kiss­ing Booth, King be­lieves it was be­cause “the en­ergy was so bright and fun and re­ally just un­de­ni­ably happy, and I don’t think we’ve seen a rom­com like that since the 1980s”.</p>
    <p>“We pay homage to those won­der­ful 1980s rom­coms that make our hearts spark with joy, and I think this movie re­ally brought that back.”</p>
    <p>Court­ney thinks the un­usual bond be­tween their char­ac­ters was an­other fac­tor. “One of the things I’ve seen (peo­ple re­spond to) over and over again is the friend­ship be­tween Elle and Lee.</p>
    <p>“There’s a pu­rity of joy and love be­tween these two peo­ple who are kind of soul mates – not in any phys­i­cal way, but they are each other’s other half. That was one of the big­gest things that clicked for peo­ple with the movie.”</p>
    <p>The se­quel also throws up a few lessons on ro­mance for younger view­ers, King adds.</p>
    <p>“In terms of love and re­la­tion­ships, one of my big­gest take­aways is that while you al­ways have to seek ad­vice, there’s re­ally no bet­ter way to learn than to make your own mis­takes. That’s one of the big­gest lessons for Elle, and also my­self and most peo­ple,” she says.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter what any­body else says, you have to pave your own way, feel all the feel­ings and break your own heart in or­der to learn lessons that need to be learnt.”</p>
    <p>• The Kiss­ing Booth and The Kiss­ing Booth 2 are avail­able on Net­flix.</p>
