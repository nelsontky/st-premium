    <p>LIS­BON • De­spite win­ning ev­ery do­mes­tic tro­phy since the Abu Dhabi takeover in 2008, the big­gest slight on Manch­ester City has been their lack of Euro­pean pedi­gree.</p>
    <p>Aside from win­ning the now-de­funct Cup-Win­ners’ Cup in 1970, the English Premier League side have never tasted suc­cess on the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Even the in­jec­tion of funds to be­come the world’s first bil­lion-dol­lar foot­ball club has not helped City shed their un­der­achiev­ing tag in Europe, hav­ing only once reached the last four of the Cham­pi­ons League in 2016.</p>
    <p>But there may be no bet­ter year than this for City to fi­nally stamp their mark as three of the four semi-fi­nal­ists will be seek­ing their maiden Euro­pean Cup.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­ting they need to win the tro­phy to truly es­tab­lish them­selves as Euro­pean pow­er­houses, de­fender Kyle Walker told the club web­site: “If you had asked me two years ago when I signed here (from Tot­ten­ham), I would have prob­a­bly said that the Premier League was the big one for me, hav­ing not won it be­fore.</p>
    <p>“Now I have col­lected two of them and a num­ber of oth­ers and this (the Cham­pi­ons League) is the one that I want. I can prob­a­bly speak on be­half of the whole squad and Manch­ester City as well for what they need to put them onto that next pedestal.”</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Pep Guardi­ola’s men elim­i­nated 13-time cham­pi­ons Real Madrid 4-2 on ag­gre­gate in the last 16 and are firm favourites head­ing into to­day’s quar­ter-fi­nal clash against Lyon.</p>
    <p>Walker, though, has warned his side not to over­look the Ligue 1 team, who are brim­ming with con­fi­dence after knock­ing out Serie A cham­pi­ons Ju­ven­tus on away goals.</p>
    <p>“Lyon have got good play­ers. Knock­ing out Ju­ven­tus speaks vol­umes. You need to be a very good team, very dis­ci­plined to beat Ju­ven­tus over two legs,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Eng­land in­ter­na­tional has ev­ery rea­son to be cau­tious. In the pre­vi­ous com­pe­ti­tion, they played each other in the group stage and Lyon were un­beaten both times, win­ning 2-1 at the Eti­had and draw­ing 2-2 at home.</p>
    <p>The bulk of that Lyon side is still in­tact and while their days as France’s dom­i­nant team have be­come a dis­tant mem­ory since the 2011 Qatari takeover of Paris Sain­tGer­main, Rudi Gar­cia’s un­her­alded team should not be un­der­es­ti­mated.</p>
    <p>They were sev­enth when the</p>
    <p>Ligue 1 sea­son ended with 10 rounds left in late April be­cause of the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>That means un­less Gar­cia’s men can lift their first Cham­pi­ons League ti­tle, they will not be play­ing in Europe next term for the first time since the 1996-97 sea­son, and that hunger to put things right is fu­elling them.</p>
    <p>Only once have Lyon made it be­yond this stage – they lost to Bay­ern Mu­nich in the 2010 semi-fi­nals, but their French coach feels they are here on merit.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to get to the ‘Fi­nal Eight’ in Lis­bon and here we are,” said Gar­cia. “We are the out­siders now but that suits us.”</p>
    <p>Their best player, as was the case two years ago, re­mains former Manch­ester United for­ward Mem­phis Depay, who has scored six goals in as many ap­pear­ances in Europe this cam­paign, and sporting di­rec­tor Jun­inho Per­nam­bu­cano be­lieves the team “are ready to do great things”.</p>
    <p>Beat­ing City would fall into that cat­e­gory, and they have done that be­fore.</p>
    <p>DON’T UN­DER­ES­TI­MATE LYON</p>
    <p>Lyon have got good play­ers. Knock­ing out Ju­ven­tus speaks vol­umes. You need to be a very good team, very dis­ci­plined to beat Ju­ven­tus over two legs.</p>
