    <p>WASH­ING­TON • It is bet­ter for Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion if Hong Kong is able to work through its prob­lems and set­tle into a new nor­mal, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We think it is bet­ter for Hong Kong and bet­ter for the re­gion and Sin­ga­pore if Hong Kong is sta­ble and calm and pros­per­ous and able to play the role which it used to play, help­ing China to grow and pros­per as well,” PM Lee said in an on­line in­ter­view hosted by the Wash­ing­ton-based At­lantic Coun­cil think-tank.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong have a “friendly com­pe­ti­tion” rather than a se­ri­ous ri­valry, said PM Lee, who was asked by the mod­er­a­tor, Amer­i­can busi­ness­man David Ruben­stein, whether the up­heaval in Hong Kong would ben­e­fit Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The Asia-Pa­cific is a big place, and there are many op­por­tu­ni­ties,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong had its ad­van­tages of be­ing on the doorstep of China, while Sin­ga­pore had a dif­fer­ent set of ad­van­tages of be­ing in the mid­dle of South-east Asia and with a broader foot­print.</p>
    <p>“On bal­ance, I would say I would much pre­fer Hong Kong do­ing well than to have peo­ple look­ing for places to go out of Hong Kong,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>He added that Sin­ga­pore has been watch­ing events in Hong Kong with con­cern for some time.</p>
    <p>“It is a deeply di­vided so­ci­ety. It has had demon­stra­tions which are bit­ter and pro­tracted and, in­creas­ingly, with a vi­o­lent tinge to them,” he said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has been em­broiled in protests for much of the past year, sparked by anger over a pro­posed Bill that would have al­lowed the ex­tra­di­tion of fugi­tives to other ju­ris­dic­tions, in­clud­ing main­land China.</p>
    <p>Though the Bill was ul­ti­mately with­drawn last year, China re­cently en­acted a con­tro­ver­sial Hong Kong na­tional se­cu­rity law – in a move that pro­test­ers said curbs free­doms in the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing an over­view of the un­fold­ing events yes­ter­day, PM Lee said that Hong Kong had an obli­ga­tion to pass a na­tional se­cu­rity law but could not do so un­der its own Con­sti­tu­tion, which was a sit­u­a­tion that could not con­tinue in­def­i­nitely, nor for the 27 re­main­ing years of the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” frame­work it op­er­ated un­der.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese there­fore de­cided that the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress in Bei­jing would pass the na­tional se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong’s be­half, he said.</p>
    <p>“In Hong Kong, the re­ac­tion has been split. Some peo­ple sup­ported it, the ad­min­is­tra­tion sup­ports it, a sig­nif­i­cant part of the pop­u­la­tion have dif­fer­ent views. But it is done.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese have said, well, you shouldn’t worry, this will only af­fect a very small num­ber of peo­ple and most peo­ple should find life car­ry­ing on as usual. As time passes, if that proves to be the case, then come home, we will set­tle into a new nor­mal,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>But the law’s pas­sage has also trig­gered re­sponses from Amer­ica as well as Bri­tain, which was party to the Joint Dec­la­ra­tion that laid out how Hong Kong would be gov­erned, he noted.</p>
    <p>“I am sure the Chi­nese must have cal­cu­lated that and de­cided that they had to do this re­gard­less,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is most un­for­tu­nate be­cause al­ready there is enough menu of com­pli­ca­tions between the US and China’s bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship, and this only makes things worse.”</p>
