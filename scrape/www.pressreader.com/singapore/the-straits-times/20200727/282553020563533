    <p>LON­DON • Peter Green (left), the in­flu­en­tial blues gui­tarist who co­founded Bri­tish rock gi­ants Fleet­wood Mac, has died at the age of 73, his fam­ily’s le­gal rep­re­sen­ta­tives an­nounced last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>De­scribed by the late gui­tar leg­end B.B. King as hav­ing “the sweet­est tone I ever heard... the only one who gave me the cold sweats”, Green formed Fleet­wood Mac with drum­mer Mick Fleet­wood in Lon­don in 1967.</p>
    <p>The vir­tu­oso blues-rock gui­tarist was be­hind songs such as Al­ba­tross and Oh Well that helped de­fine the band’s unique sound and pro­pel them to world­wide fame.</p>
    <p>Green also penned Black Magic Woman, cov­ered fa­mously by Car­los San­tana in 1970.</p>
    <p>“It is with great sad­ness that the fam­ily of Peter Green an­nounce his death this week­end, peace­fully in his sleep,” said a state­ment from Swan Tur­ton so­lic­i­tors. “A fur­ther state­ment will be pro­vided in the com­ing days.”</p>
    <p>Green, who was born Peter Green­baum in Lon­don’s Beth­nal Green into a Jewish fam­ily, was in­ducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, along with the rest of the band.</p>
    <p>“With the orig­i­nal Fleet­wood Mac, he was Bri­tain’s most pro­gres­sive blues gui­tarist,” said Rolling Stone mag­a­zine, which in 2015 in­cluded Green in its 100 Great­est Gui­tarists.</p>
    <p>The Smiths gui­tarist and song­writer Johnny Marr, also paid trib­ute to Green. “R.I.P Peter Green. A unique artist and a beau­ti­ful gui­tar player,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>In 1970, men­tal-health is­sues and sub­stance abuse forced Green out of Fleet­wood Mac.</p>
    <p>He ended up sleep­ing rough and later un­der­went elec­tro-con­vul­sive ther­apy in hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Fleet­wood drafted in Ste­vie Nicks, Lind­sey Buckingham and Chris­tine McVie, wife of orig­i­nal mem­ber John McVie, as the band went on to record iconic al­bums Fleet­wood Mac and Ru­mours.</p>
    <p>Singer-song­writer Cat Stevens paid trib­ute on Twit­ter to “the in­ef­fa­ble Peter Green”, call­ing him “one of the un­sung he­roes of mu­si­cal in­tegrity, in­no­va­tion and spirit”. “When I heard he left Fleet­wood Mac in 1970 to get a real life and do­nate his wealth to char­ity, he be­came some­thing of a model for me,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Whites­nake lead singer David Coverdale saluted a mu­si­cian he said he once played sup­port for, when Green was still play­ing with the orig­i­nal Fleet­wood Mac.</p>
    <p>“An artist I truly loved and ad­mired,” he wrote on Twit­ter. “He was a breath­tak­ing singer, gui­tarist and com­poser... I know who I will be lis­ten­ing to to­day... RIP.”</p>
    <p>Green is sur­vived by daugh­ter Rose­bud from his brief mar­riage to Jane Sa­muels.</p>
