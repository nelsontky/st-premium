    <p>LARUNS (France) • Pri­moz Roglic took com­mand of the Tour de France de­spite nar­rowly los­ing out to fel­low Slove­nian Tadej Po­gacar on the ninth stage, as Bri­ton Adam Yates’ lim­its were ex­posed in the sec­ond moun­tain test yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The race favourite played it safe on the last climb of the day, but it was enough for him to take the yel­low jersey and move to the top of the stand­ings de­spite com­ing sec­ond in a near photo fin­ish.</p>
    <p>Tour debu­tant Po­gacar, the most at­tack­ing rider on the fi­nal climb (a 7.7km ef­fort at an av­er­age gra­di­ent of 8.6 per cent) up to the Col de Marie-Blanque, out­sprinted Roglic and break­away rider Marc Hirschi of Switzer­land to move up to seventh over­all, 44 sec­onds off the pace.</p>
    <p>He gained back more time af­ter los­ing 1min 20sec in the cross­winds on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“It was an amaz­ing day, I gave ev­ery­thing in the last climb but I could not drop my ri­vals. But the stage win makes up for it,” said the 21-year-old, who fin­ished third over­all in his Grand Tour de­but at the Vuelta a Es­pana last year.</p>
    <p>“Pri­moz has won be­fore and will win more. I hope we can do great things to­gether (as Slove­ni­ans).”</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing cham­pion Egan Ber­nal fin­ished fourth in the five­man lead­ing group to sit in sec­ond place over­all, 21sec be­hind Roglic.</p>
    <p>Yates, who made no mys­tery of his lim­ited am­bi­tions on the Tour, ended the stage in 15th place, 54sec off the pace, and dropped to eighth over­all at 1:02 back.</p>
    <p>As the race heads into its first rest stop to­day, when all the rid­ers will be sub­mit­ted to a coron­avirus test, Roglic sits in pole po­si­tion but Colom­bian Ber­nal, who rel­ishes the long climbs of the Alps com­ing in the third week, is also where he wanted to be.</p>
    <p>The day af­ter Thibaut Pinot lost all hope of be­com­ing the first lo­cal win­ner of the Tour in 35 years, French­man Guil­laume Martin, who started the day sec­ond over­all, slid to third, 28sec off the pace, af­ter los­ing touch with the top guns on the as­cent. Com­pa­triot Ro­main Bardet is fourth, 30sec be­hind Roglic.</p>
