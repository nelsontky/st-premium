    <p>Self-dis­in­fect­ing coat­ings have been ap­plied in the toi­lets as well as on the han­dles of over­head stor­age com­part­ments on Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) planes, as the car­rier pre­pares to wel­come more pas­sen­gers on board.</p>
    <p>The air­line is also work­ing with the au­thor­i­ties on Covid-19 test­ing pro­to­cols, with more de­tails to be an­nounced at a later date.</p>
    <p>Th­ese come on top of ear­lier an­nounced mea­sures, such as a push to­wards us­ing tech­nol­ogy for a con­tact­less jour­ney, SIA told The Straits Times yes­ter­day, ahead of the launch of the first air travel bub­ble flights to Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence Yeoh Phee Teik said SIA has been col­lect­ing feed­back about the con­cerns pas­sen­gers have, in or­der to ad­dress them.</p>
    <p>“We have also taken it upon our­selves to vi­su­alise the cus­tomer jour­ney from end to end... and imag­ine that we are the cus­tomer turn­ing up at the air­port,” he said.</p>
    <p>“All th­ese in­puts guide us on how we can keep step­ping up our ef­forts to en­sure – and to re­as­sure our cus­tomers – it is safe to travel.”</p>
    <p>SIA chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong had pre­vi­ously listed sev­eral ini­tia­tives to im­prove safety for pas­sen­gers, in an in­ter­view with ST in June.</p>
    <p>Th­ese mea­sures aim to cover the en­tire flight process, from go­ing through im­mi­gra­tion and board­ing a plane to dis­em­barka­tion.</p>
    <p>Most of the planned mea­sures have been im­ple­mented, Mr Yeoh said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, trav­ellers can now ac­cess SIA’s web­site to find out about Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions and re­quire­ments in the cities that SIA flies to.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers can also use their mo­bile phones to ac­cess SIA’s in­flight menu and its dig­i­tal li­brary.</p>
    <p>Other pre­cau­tions that are re­quired by the Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, such as the com­pul­sory wear­ing of masks and sim­pli­fied meal ser­vice, re­main in place.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh said SIA will con­tinue to work with reg­u­la­tors on the nec­es­sary safety re­quire­ments for flights dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He added that SIA is con­fi­dent that all th­ese mea­sures will come to­gether to create a safe en­vi­ron­ment for trav­ellers to fly in.</p>
    <p>He de­clined to reveal de­tails about the num­ber of crew and pas­sen­gers who were in­fected with Covid-19 on SIA’s flights, but cited stud­ies which have shown that the risk of in­fec­tion on board</p>
    <p>RE­AS­SUR­ING CUS­TOMERS</p>
    <p>We have also taken it upon our­selves to vi­su­alise the cus­tomer jour­ney from end to end... and imag­ine that we are the cus­tomer turn­ing up at the air­port.</p>
    <p>All th­ese in­puts guide us on how we can keep step­ping up our ef­forts to en­sure – and to re­as­sure our cus­tomers – it is safe to travel.</p>
    <p>SE­NIOR VICE-PRES­I­DENT OF CUS­TOMER EX­PE­RI­ENCE YEOH PHEE</p>
    <p>TEIK, on what Sin­ga­pore Air­lines has been do­ing to ad­dress the con­cerns that pas­sen­gers have about fly­ing dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>a plane is low.</p>
    <p>“The high-ef­fi­ciency par­tic­u­late air fil­ters, the re­fresh­ing of the air sup­ply in the plane ev­ery two to three min­utes, the seats act­ing as a bar­rier, pas­sen­gers wear­ing masks... I think it is enough to make many pas­sen­gers con­fi­dent and as­sured to fly with SIA,” said</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh.</p>
    <p>While health ex­perts have pre­vi­ously flagged plane toi­lets as an in­fec­tion risk, given that there are com­monly touched sur­faces such as door han­dles and toi­let flushes, Mr Yeoh said SIA has sought to ad­dress this.</p>
    <p>On top of the an­timi­cro­bial coat­ing ap­plied on var­i­ous sur­faces, SIA’s cabin crew wipe the toi­let door han­dles with a dis­in­fec­tant proven to kill the Covid-19 virus, he said.</p>
    <p>When asked whether the cost of such ad­di­tional mea­sures will be passed on to pas­sen­gers, Mr Yeoh said: “No, this health and safety pro­to­col is a given from the pas­sen­ger re­quire­ments stand­point.</p>
    <p>“It is our duty to make sure that the jour­ney they have with us is safe from the be­gin­ning to the end... it is a very in­te­gral part of the over­all cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
