    <p>Con­crete has fallen off two pil­lars and ex­posed the re­in­forc­ing steel beams along the fourth-floor cor­ri­dor of Block 915 Tampines Street 91, caus­ing worry among res­i­dents that the fall­ing con­crete could in­jure passers-by.</p>
    <p>Large cracks are also show­ing on many con­crete pil­lars and beams along the cor­ri­dor which has six units, Chi­nese evening news­pa­per Lianhe Wan­bao said yesterday.</p>
    <p>A res­i­dent who has lived in the block for 20 years told Wan­bao he had no­ticed con­crete fall­ing off the pil­lar in front of his flat and onto his shoe rack ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>He said his fam­ily did not think much of it ini­tially but their con­cern grew when they no­ticed cracks show­ing on many of the pil­lars in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>The res­i­dent, who de­clined to be named, also said that fall­ing con­crete could hit res­i­dents walk­ing along the cor­ri­dor or even in­jure peo­ple walk­ing down­stairs.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, a Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA) spokesman said yesterday that the cracks on the pil­lars do not af­fect the over­all struc­tural in­tegrity of the build­ing.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­ity added that it had in­spected the af­fected block af­ter be­ing alerted to feed­back on Tues­day, and has since in­structed the town coun­cil to carry out the nec­es­sary rec­ti­fi­ca­tion works.</p>
    <p>Tampines Town Coun­cil told ST that it has been in touch with the res­i­dents and “ar­ranged for nec­es­sary rec­ti­fi­ca­tion works”.</p>
    <p>The town coun­cil added that the block is due to un­dergo re­pair and re­dec­o­ra­tion works next year.</p>
    <p>“Nev­er­the­less, we will be in­spect­ing the blocks in the vicin­ity to pre­vent a sim­i­lar oc­cur­rence from hap­pen­ing,” it said.</p>
    <p>The af­fected block is 37 years old. Ac­cord­ing to Wan­bao, the other floors do not face is­sues of con­crete fall­ing or cracks form­ing on pil­lars.</p>
    <p>An­other res­i­dent from the same block, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lee, said there are also cracks form­ing on the ceil­ing of his unit, which he has re­paired mul­ti­ple times over the past three years.</p>
    <p>The 64-year-old, who works in the se­cu­rity in­dus­try, said he had spent around $6,000 to re­pair the ceil­ing but cracks have emerged again this year.</p>
    <p>He added that the cracks in the ceil­ing have caused a shift in down­ward pres­sure and he is un­able to fully open one of his slid­ing win­dows as a re­sult.</p>
