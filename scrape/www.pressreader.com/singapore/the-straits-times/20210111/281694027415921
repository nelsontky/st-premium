    <p>Malaysia’s Eco­nomic Af­fairs Min­is­ter Mustapa Mo­hamed has tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus and is in sta­ble con­di­tion, his of­fice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He tested pos­i­tive fol­low­ing a Covid-19 test last Satur­day morn­ing, three days after he at­tended a Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu) meet­ing at which Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin and sev­eral other Cabi­net mem­bers were present.</p>
    <p>The Malay Mail re­ported that Datuk Seri Mustapa also at­tended a Cabi­net meet­ing that Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu in­for­ma­tion chief Wan Sai­ful Wan Jan said all those who at­tended the party meet­ing will un­dergo Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>Mr Mustapa got tested in Kota Baru in his home state of Ke­lan­tan after trav­el­ling from the cap­i­tal Kuala Lumpur, his of­fice said.</p>
    <p>He has been ad­mit­ted to a public hos­pi­tal in Ke­lan­tan since Satur­day night, and re­mains in sta­ble con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“Datuk Seri Mustapa apologises for all the dif­fi­cul­ties that arise from this mat­ter,” his of­fice said, with­out dis­clos­ing the source of his in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said yes­ter­day that it was trac­ing his close con­tacts.</p>
    <p>Mr Mustapa, who is a for­mer trade min­is­ter and the MP for Jeli ward in Ke­lan­tan, tested neg­a­tive at a pre­vi­ous test taken on Jan 1.</p>
    <p>He is the sec­ond mem­ber of Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Cabi­net to test pos­i­tive for the virus, after Re­li­gious Af­fairs Min­is­ter Zulk­i­fli Mo­hamad Al-Bakri in Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Mustapa’s pos­i­tive test comes as cases con­tinue to soar in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has recorded 80 deaths from the virus in the first 10 days of this year. It has a to­tal of 135,992 cases of Covid-19 so far, with 551 deaths.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has pur­chased 12.8 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine. The first batch is not due to ar­rive un­til next month.</p>
