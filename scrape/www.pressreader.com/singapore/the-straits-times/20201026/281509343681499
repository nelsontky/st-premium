    <p>There is no need for Sin­ga­pore­ans to rush to col­lect the TraceTo­gether to­kens, said Min­is­ter-in­charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vivian Balakr­ish­nan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The con­tact trac­ing de­vices can cur­rently be col­lected at 38 com­mu­nity cen­tres (CCs), but will be avail­able at all 108 com­mu­nity cen­tres by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan said that from to­day, Sin­ga­pore­ans are ad­vised to col­lect their to­kens from their area’s com­mu­nity clubs and use the To­ken Go Where web­site to see when the sched­ule for dis­tri­bu­tion would be­gin there.</p>
    <p>This is to pre­vent long queues from build­ing up at dis­tri­bu­tion points.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing to the me­dia at Buona Vista Com­mu­nity Club yes­ter­day evening, fol­low­ing re­ports of long queues at some of the col­lec­tion points on the first week­end since the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced that check­ing in with the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken would be manda­tory by end-De­cem­ber at all public venues, in­clud­ing restau­rants, work­places, schools and shop­ping malls.</p>
    <p>He also gave as­sur­ance that there would be more than enough to­kens.</p>
    <p>“We will ad­just the numbers sup­plied to meet the de­mand, ob­vi­ously, and our con­tracts al­low us to make those nec­es­sary ad­just­ments,” he said.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent tar­get num­ber of to­kens to be pro­duced is about 2.7 mil­lion, but this num­ber can be ad­justed in ac­cor­dance with de­mand, said Dr Balakr­ish­nan, who is also For­eign Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>When the to­kens were first rolled out, the pri­or­ity was to dis­trib­ute them to se­nior cit­i­zens and those who may not have ac­cess to a smart­phone. But peo­ple’s pref­er­ences will also be taken into ac­count, as some Sin­ga­pore­ans have given feed­back that they pre­fer us­ing the to­ken to the app, said Dr Balakr­ish­nan.</p>
    <p>“I want to pro­vide peo­ple with that op­tion, be­cause the key thing is par­tic­i­pa­tion – the over­all par­tic­i­pa­tion in the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme,” he said.</p>
    <p>Even though the cur­rent num­ber of lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases is very low, this is not a time to be com­pla­cent, and con­tact trac­ing con­tin­ues to be crit­i­cal, he said.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, over 50 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion – more than 2.5 mil­lion peo­ple – have down­loaded the TraceTo­gether app, and over 400,000 to­kens have been dis­trib­uted, he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan said: “I would also make the as­sur­ance that the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the TraceTo­gether-only Safe En­try pro­gramme will not pro­ceed un­til we make sure that ev­ery­one has ac­cess to ei­ther a to­ken or the app and is com­fort­able us­ing it.”</p>
    <p>He also said that in the months ahead, if the sit­u­a­tion world­wide im­proves and the bor­ders can open up more, for­eign­ers will also need to par­tic­i­pate in the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme ei­ther through the app or some form of a to­ken.</p>
