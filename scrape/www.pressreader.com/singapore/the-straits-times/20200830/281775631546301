    <p>Bereft of tourists due to border clo­sures and flight sus­pen­sions, the streets of Chi­na­town have been quiet dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>But an or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee hopes to bring some cheer back to the area next month by stag­ing the an­nual Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val cel­e­bra­tions – al­beit scaled down and mostly on­line to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>On­line com­pe­ti­tions such as lan­tern paint­ing or In­sta­gram photo con­tests will be held in­stead of nightly stage shows, fes­tive bazaars and mass lan­tern walks.</p>
    <p>While the tra­di­tional street lightup will still take place from Sept 17 to Oct 16, a 360-de­gree vir­tual tour of the dec­o­ra­tions will also be made avail­able so that peo­ple can ad­mire them from the com­fort of their homes.</p>
    <p>The light-up cer­e­mony will take place on Sept 17 and will be livestream­ed on­line.</p>
    <p>This year’s light-up will com­prise about 700 lanterns and sculp­tures, which de­pict tra­di­tional fes­ti­val mo­tifs and char­ac­ters such as Chang’e, god­dess of the moon in Chi­nese mythol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The dis­play will also il­lus­trate this year’s theme – family – and un­der­score the cen­tral role that fa­mil­ial ties play in get­ting Sin­ga­pore­ans through the cri­sis, Mr Vin­cent Tan, a new ini­tia­tive un­der the Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme run by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) that pro­vides demon­stra­tions and hands-on ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>These are be­ing held at SG Dig­i­tal com­mu­nity hubs is­land­wide. There are 30 al­ready in op­er­a­tion, mostly in com­mu­nity cen­tres, with a fur­ther 25 to be set up in pub­lic li­braries.</p>
    <p>Se­niors can learn how to use their de­vices to buy items be­fore putting their skills to use at neigh­bour­hood shops.</p>
    <p>They can also pick up other skills, such as us­ing apps like What­sApp, in one-to-one ses­sions with dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran noted af­ter a visit to the SG Dig­i­tal com­mu­nity chair­man of the Chi­na­town Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val 2020 Or­gan­is­ing Com­mit­tee, told The Sun­day Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“(It also) re­minds all Sin­ga­pore­ans that we can weather through this cri­sis as one united Sin­ga­pore family,” he added.</p>
    <p>The lanterns and sculp­tures will line New Bridge Road, Eu Tong Sen Street and South Bridge Road. A 10m-tall cen­tre­piece de­pict­ing a family re­union scene will also be placed at the junc­tion of Eu Tong Sen Street and Up­per Cross Street.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said the com­mit­tee de­cided to scale down the event and be more fi­nan­cially pru­dent in mark­ing the fes­ti­val this year, in view of Covid-19. This year’s cele­hub in Teck Ghee Com­mu­nity Club yes­ter­day that the Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme has made sig­nif­i­cant progress in help­ing se­niors pick up dig­i­tal skills since its launch in May.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which is spear­headed by the Sin­ga­pore Dig­i­tal Of­fice un­der the IMDA, has al­ready helped around 16,000 se­niors and is on track to ben­e­fit 100,000 by March next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran noted that the aim is not to get se­niors to com­pletely re­place cash: “Some will still want to use it in cer­tain lo­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>But if se­niors can learn about other al­ter­na­tives, they will have more op­tions to choose from when pay­ing for goods, he added.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has ramped up ef­forts in re­cent months to pro­mote dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion in re­sponse to</p>
    <p>Yuen Sin</p>
    <p>bra­tions are ex­pected to cost 70 per cent less than in previous years.</p>
    <p>Yet, the com­mit­tee also felt it was still im­por­tant to mark the oc­ca­sion amid the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to up­lift the spir­its of Sin­ga­pore­ans dur­ing this dif­fi­cult time,” said Mr Tan. It also demon­strates the com­mit­tee’s com­mit­ment to pro­mote Chi­nese cul­ture, and the her­itage and tra­di­tions of the fes­ti­val de­spite the cir­cum­stances, he added.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors are wel­come to visit Chi­na­town to take in the dec­o­ra­tions this year, though they should be mind­ful of the need to avoid crowd­ing and prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have de­ployed safe dis­tanc­ing of­fi­cers in Chi­na­town and the com­mit­tee may work with them to en­sure that rules are be­ing ad­hered to dur­ing the cel­e­bra­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>With less foot­fall in Chi­na­town now due to the ab­sence of tourists, he hopes the fes­tive dec­o­ra­tions will draw more traf­fic to the area and help strug­gling lo­cal busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion about the ac­tiv­i­ties will be made avail­able on the Chi­na­town Fes­ti­vals web­site as well as on its Face­book and In­sta­gram pages. wide­spread eco­nomic and so­cial dis­rup­tion brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran also an­nounced in June that there will be in­creased sup­port for low-in­come se­niors through the pro­vi­sion of more af­ford­able mo­bile data plans and ba­sic smart­phones. More than 800 se­niors have ben­e­fited.</p>
    <p>He noted that Covid-19 has caused some se­niors to feel that they are un­able to con­tinue with nor­mal life, say­ing: “They get de­tached from the reg­u­lar cy­cles, whether it is their so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties and their other daily ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“So, one im­por­tant value propo­si­tion of dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy is re­ally to help our se­niors cope with this kind of chal­lenge.”</p>
