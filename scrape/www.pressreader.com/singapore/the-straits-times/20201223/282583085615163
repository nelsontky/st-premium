    <p>For many, re­lax­ation means plop­ping down in front of the tele­vi­sion and watch­ing their favourite dra­mas or movies at the end of a stress­ful day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this may not do much to mit­i­gate the neg­a­tive ef­fects of stress.</p>
    <p>Dr Geral­dine Tan, di­rec­tor and prin­ci­pal psy­chol­o­gist at The Ther­apy Room, said: “Peo­ple need to re­learn how to re­lax with­out de­vices.”</p>
    <p>Re­search has shown that ac­tiv­i­ties such as med­i­ta­tion, ex­er­cise, and be­ing in na­ture can im­prove phys­i­cal and men­tal en­ergy while re­duc­ing the risk of de­vel­op­ing diseases as­so­ci­ated with stress.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said pas­sive ac­tiv­i­ties such as knit­ting, pot­tery and colour­ing can also calm the mind and pro­vide re­lax­ation.</p>
    <p>Play­ing games such as Cha­rades and Twis­ter are also good ways to con­nect with friends for so­cial sup­port and laugh­ter, she said.</p>
    <p>“As they say, laugh­ter is the best medicine. Laugh­ter re­leases chem­i­cals that re­lax the mind and be­ing with peo­ple helps you feel cared for,” she added.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist Feli­cia Neo of Neo Cooper Psy­chol­ogy Clinic said ac­tiv­i­ties such as read­ing, lis­ten­ing to au­dio­books or do­ing sim­ple yoga or breath­ing ex­er­cises can help a per­son re­lax and recharge.</p>
    <p>She also high­lighted the im­por­tance of prac­tis­ing self-care. This could be sched­ul­ing small breaks in between work. The du­ra­tion of the break can vary and be as short as a five-minute walk around the house, she said.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, it is most im­por­tant to pay at­ten­tion and learn to lis­ten to your­self. This per­tains to your own phys­i­cal, psy­cho­log­i­cal and emo­tional needs. Does your body need more rest? Does it need more me-time?” she added.</p>
    <p>Dr Annabelle Chow, prin­ci­pal clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at Annabelle Psy­chol­ogy, warned that not en­gag­ing in ac­tiv­i­ties that re­lax and recharge the mind and body can lead to ac­cu­mu­lated stress and fa­tigue over time.</p>
    <p>“Pro­longed stress dis­rupts many of our body’s func­tions such as a sup­pressed di­ges­tive sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>This, she said, puts peo­ple at an in­creased risk of de­pres­sion, anx­i­ety, mem­ory and con­cen­tra­tion im­pair­ment, and other men­tal health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Here are seven things you can do to re­lax and recharge your bat­ter­ies.</p>
