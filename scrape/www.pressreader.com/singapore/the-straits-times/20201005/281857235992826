    <p>With the push of a but­ton, the big white robot lights up and its spindly arms spring to life, grind­ing cof­fee beans and boil­ing a flask of hot wa­ter.</p>
    <p>It takes 261 in­di­vid­ual move­ments and three minutes for the Ro­botic Cof­fee Master – which re­sem­bles a Miche­lin man but with un­usu­ally long arms – to brew a cup of pour-over cof­fee.</p>
    <p>The robot barista was launched on Sept 25 by Chi­nese robotics maker Ori­onS­tar in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese firm and other in­dus­try ex­perts are ex­pect­ing de­mand for ser­vice ro­bots like the cof­feemaker to rise as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic, as busi­nesses look to au­to­ma­tion to re­duce both the risk of virus trans­mis­sion as well as man­power costs.</p>
    <p>Ori­onS­tar vice-pres­i­dent Su Liang said the com­pany was keen to help small busi­nesses like cafes re­duce run­ning costs.</p>
    <p>“A robot like this con­sumes only elec­tric­ity. Once you pull the plug, you don’t have to pay to keep it run­ning,” said Mr Su.</p>
    <p>“With hu­man staff, your abil­ity to han­dle the dis­rup­tion from a pan­demic is very poor.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany has a pre­vi­ous it­er­a­tion of a robot barista, which is also equipped with two ro­botic arms to brew cof­fee.</p>
    <p>Called Chee­tah Cafe, it was launched in 2018 and re­sem­bles a karaoke booth.</p>
    <p>But Chee­tah Cafe’s bulky and boxy na­ture meant it was more suited to ex­hi­bi­tions or in­dus­trial set­tings, said Mr Su who dis­closed that the com­pany wanted a robot that would be more ap­peal­ing to con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Ori­onS­tar has a range of dif­fer­ent ser­vice ro­bots, in­clud­ing those that can greet and serve cus­tomers in malls and oth­ers that can de­liver meals in ho­tels.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which has de­ployed some 11,000 ro­bots across China as of May, ex­pects de­mand for ser­vice ro­bots to “ex­plode” in the next three to five years as a re­sult of the pan­demic and ris­ing labour costs.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust last year, the Chi­nese In­sti­tute of Elec­tron­ics had pro­jected that Chi­nese sales of ser­vice ro­bots would rise 33 per cent last year to US$2.2 bil­lion (S$3 bil­lion) from the pre­vi­ous year, with growth out­strip­ping mar­kets else­where.</p>
    <p>In a report last month, strate­gic ad­vi­sory firm YCP So­lid­i­ance said the pan­demic has caused ex­plo­sive short-term de­mand for ser­vice ro­bots for med­i­cal and lo­gis­tics pur­poses.</p>
    <p>It pointed out that China had rolled out ro­bots to con­duct mass dis­in­fec­tion, and de­ployed them to mon­i­tor tem­per­a­tures and aid in food de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>“The de­mand for ser­vice ro­bots will likely per­sist in the long term and see not only grow­ing pen­e­tra­tion rate but widen­ing ap­pli­ca­tions,” said the report.</p>
    <p>Un­til quite re­cently, China’s ro­bots have been de­ployed mostly in in­dus­trial ar­eas – in fac­to­ries and ware­houses. But this is set to change as other busi­nesses also seek to au­to­mate, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The trend is also be­ing driven by ris­ing labour costs.</p>
    <p>Av­er­age an­nual wages in China rose 60 per cent over five years to reach 82,413 yuan (S$16,550) in 2018, fig­ures from the Na­tional Bureau of Sta­tis­tics showed.</p>
    <p>Dr Luo Jun, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the In­ter­na­tional Robotics and In­tel­li­gent Equip­ment In­dus­try Al­liance, said mar­ket prospects of ser­vice ro­bots are broad, point­ing out that they are now used for med­i­cal re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion, home care, shop­ping malls and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>“As AI tech­nol­ogy con­tin­ues to im­prove and ma­ture, they will be­come more ubiq­ui­tous,” said Dr Luo.</p>
