    <p>Cat me­ows con­stantly</p>
    <p>My fam­ily and I adopted Juno (right), a four-year-old mixed Si­amese, from the So­ci­ety for the Pre­ven­tion of Cru­elty to Animals last year. She has brought us much joy, but we are con­cerned that she may have separation anx­i­ety. She fol­lows me around al­most ev­ery­where, which is heart­warm­ing, but me­ows in­ces­santly when I am not with her. Also, when I go to bed, she will meow loudly and con­tin­u­ously for me to ac­com­pany her. When I take her to my room, she will want to go out­side, but will again meow loudly for me to fol­low her. This usu­ally keeps my other fam­ily mem­bers awake. How can we min­imise this? Josephine Tan</p>
    <p>A plan for en­vi­ron­men­tal and be­havioural mod­i­fi­ca­tion can be de­vel­oped to tackle such be­havioural is­sues. This usu­ally re­quires de­tailed his­tory-tak­ing of the home en­vi­ron­ment and the in­ter­ac­tions of your cat with house­hold mem­bers first.</p>
    <p>A de­tailed un­der­stand­ing of the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing the be­hav­iour – in­clud­ing the en­vi­ron­ment, what hap­pens be­fore and af­ter the be­hav­iour, po­ten­tial mo­ti­va­tions for her vo­cal­is­ing be­hav­iour, and what re­in­forces the be­hav­iour – is im­por­tant when con­firm­ing if the is­sue is truly separation anx­i­ety and help­ing to iden­tify what can be done to mod­ify it.</p>
    <p>Some ques­tions to con­sider in­clude: Does Juno di­rect this be­hav­iour only at you or does she also re­act in the same way to other house­hold mem­bers? Does it hap­pen only when you are at home or does it also hap­pen when you leave your home?</p>
    <p>In some cases, the me­ow­ing be­hav­iour could have been re­in­forced by what hap­pens af­ter she vo­calises.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, she might have</p>
    <p>“me­owed” to seek at­ten­tion or play.</p>
    <p>When she does so, per­haps to en­ter a room and you open the room door, this may in­ad­ver­tently re­in­force the be­hav­iour. This means that she may re­peat the be­hav­iour when seek­ing at­ten­tion in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>If this is in­deed a contributi­ng fac­tor, you can sched­ule pre­dictable so­cial in­ter­ac­tions – in­clud­ing play and so­cial time – into Juno’s daily rou­tine, and re­ward her ex­hibit­ing re­laxed and in­de­pen­dent be­hav­iour, such as spend­ing time chill­ing out on a mat away from you, in­stead of seek­ing at­ten­tion or food.</p>
    <p>The at­ten­tion-seek­ing be­hav­iour should no longer be re­warded with at­ten­tion. In­stead, the cat can be directed to de­sir­able be­hav­iour, such as sit­ting on the mat, be­fore get­ting re­warded.</p>
    <p>If her be­hav­iour is caus­ing prob­lems, you should seek help from an an­i­mal be­hav­iour con­sul­tant.</p>
    <p>To di­ag­nose separation anx­i­ety, it is im­por­tant to first ex­am­ine the an­i­mal and watch its be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Should fe­male brindle Frenchie be spayed?</p>
    <p>We own a fe­male brindle Frenchie. She is around 11 months old and has had her first heat a month ago. There was just one in­stance of drip­ping of blood, but it stopped. Is this nor­mal? She was lethar­gic for a day af­ter that, but is now back to nor­mal. If her menses is so light, should we still spay her? At what age should we do so? Also, she tends to eat her poop if we do not stop her in time. Why is this so?</p>
    <p>Natasha Lee Xuan Lynn</p>
    <p>The oestrus cy­cle in dogs dif­fers from the men­strual cy­cle, so tech­ni­cally, it is not called men­stru­a­tion. In­stead, vagi­nal bleed­ing typ­i­cally oc­curs on the first day of heat, but the amount varies and the on­set may be missed. Spay­ing your dog can some­times help with this.</p>
    <p>Be­sides help­ing with vagi­nal bleed­ing, it is also im­por­tant to spay your dog to re­duce the risk of her de­vel­op­ing cer­tain diseases, such as mam­mary tu­mours, and pre­vent un­wanted preg­nan­cies.</p>
    <p>Do dis­cuss with your vet­eri­nar­ian if you should spay your dog as he can pro­vide a more in­formed rec­om­men­da­tion based on your pet’s his­tory and lifestyle.</p>
    <p>Eat­ing poop, or co­propha­gia, can be nor­mal be­hav­iour in nurs­ing dogs or young pup­pies. How­ever, co­propha­gia has been linked to med­i­cal is­sues too, such as mal­ab­sorp­tion and nu­tri­tional de­fi­cien­cies. Hence it is im­por­tant for you to take your dog to the vet for an ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Co­propha­gia is also as­so­ci­ated with a lack of stim­u­la­tion or en­rich­ment, hunger, stress or anx­i­ety, so it is im­por­tant to dis­cuss with your vet to de­ter­mine if th­ese is­sues could have con­trib­uted to the be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, an easy way to avoid deal­ing with co­propha­gia is to be alert and promptly clean up af­ter your pet has defe­cated.</p>
