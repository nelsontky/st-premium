    <p>In a speech no­table for its as­per­ity, hours af­ter the Elec­toral Col­lege handed him the pres­i­dency, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den on Mon­day night ripped into the “base­less claims” about the le­git­i­macy of the United States’ elec­tion and called on Amer­i­cans to ac­cept the out­come.</p>
    <p>“The in­tegrity of our elec­tions re­mains in­tact,” he said in Wilmington, Delaware – his Se­nate con­stituency and home – soon af­ter he and Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris re­ceived the ex­pected 306 votes in the Elec­toral Col­lege – the same num­ber that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump won in 2016.</p>
    <p>This time, Mr Trump had 232 votes.</p>
    <p>“Now it is time to turn the page as we’ve done through­out our his­tory,” Mr Bi­den said. “To unite. To heal. As I said through this cam­paign, I will be a pres­i­dent for all Amer­i­cans.”</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cantly, yes­ter­day morn­ing, Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell con­grat­u­lated Mr Bi­den, a green light for other Repub­li­cans to do the same.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Bi­den flayed Repub­li­cans’ at­tempt to get the Supreme Court to over­turn certified re­sults in key swing states in a suit filed by Texas and sup­ported by 17 Repub­li­can At­tor­neys-Gen­eral and 126 Repub­li­can mem­bers of Congress, which was dis­missed by the Supreme Court last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“This le­gal ma­noeu­vre was an ef­fort by elected of­fi­cials in one group of states to try to get the Supreme Court to wipe out the votes of more than 20 mil­lion Amer­i­cans in other states and to hand the pres­i­dency to a can­di­date who lost the Elec­toral Col­lege, lost the pop­u­lar vote, and lost each and ev­ery one of the states whose votes they were try­ing to re­verse,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a po­si­tion so ex­treme we’ve never seen it be­fore. A po­si­tion that re­fused to re­spect the will of the peo­ple, re­fused to re­spect the rule of law, and re­fused to hon­our our Con­sti­tu­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said the na­tion’s high­est court sent a “clear sig­nal” to Mr Trump and his al­lies that it would not take part in this as­sault on democ­racy.</p>
    <p>De­spite Mr Bi­den’s em­phatic win, the mood re­mained fraught, with many of Mr Trump’s sup­port­ers still re­fus­ing to ac­cept the out­come.</p>
    <p>In swing states, the Elec­toral Col­lege votes took place un­der heavy se­cu­rity. One Michi­gan state Repub­li­can law­maker, Mr Gary Eisen, told a ra­dio sta­tion he planned to help chal­lenge the elec­tion even if it would not change the re­sult – and said he could not guar­an­tee peo­ple’s safety. Fol­low­ing an up­roar, he was re­moved from his com­mit­tee posts.</p>
    <p>But while right-wing cir­cles and me­dia – and Mr Trump – con­tin­ued to am­plify the­o­ries of fraud, Mr McCon­nell’s ac­knowl­edge­ment of Mr Bi­den’s win – the Pres­i­dent-elect’s first – was a sign of the in­evitable.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, who un­til Mon­day had kept silent on the US elec­tion re­sults, also con­grat­u­lated Mr Bi­den, the Krem­lin said.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin “wished ev­ery suc­cess to the Pres­i­dent-elect and ex­pressed con­fi­dence that Rus­sia and the US, who bear spe­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity for global se­cu­rity and sta­bil­ity, can fa­cil­i­tate res­o­lu­tion of many prob­lems and chal­lenges faced by the world now de­spite dis­agree­ments”, the Krem­lin said.</p>
    <p>“Rus­sian-Amer­i­can co­op­er­a­tion, based on the prin­ci­ples of equal­ity and mu­tual re­spect, would meet the in­ter­ests of both na­tions and the en­tire in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. For my part, I am ready for in­ter­ac­tion and con­tacts with you.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, in his speech, re­peat­edly had to clear his throat, de­tract­ing some­what from its im­pact. But he was nev­er­the­less force­ful, say­ing: “Ev­ery av­enue was made avail­able to Pres­i­dent Trump to con­test the re­sults... Pres­i­dent Trump was de­nied no course of ac­tion he wanted to take.”</p>
    <p>The pres­sure put on Amer­i­cans go­ing about the work of the elec­tion was “un­con­scionable”, he added. “So many of these pa­tri­otic Amer­i­cans were sub­jected to so much: enor­mous po­lit­i­cal pres­sure, ver­bal abuse and even threats of phys­i­cal vi­o­lence,” he said. “I hope we never again see any­one sub­jected to the kind of threats and abuse we saw in this elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics In­der­jeet Par­mar of the City, Univer­sity of Lon­don told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “US democ­racy just about squeaked through this stress test – but it is badly wounded and may not with­stand such a test again, es­pe­cially if the vote tally is closer next time.”</p>
    <p>The in­tegrity of our elec­tions re­mains in­tact... Now it is time to turn the page as we’ve done through­out our his­tory. To unite. To heal. As I said through this cam­paign, I will be a pres­i­dent for all Amer­i­cans.</p>
