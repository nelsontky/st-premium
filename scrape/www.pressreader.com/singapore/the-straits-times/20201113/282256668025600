    <p>IS­TAN­BUL • Lewis Hamilton can match Michael Schu­macher’s record seven world cham­pi­onships and over­take the Fer­rari great as the most suc­cess­ful For­mula One driver of all time at the Turk­ish Grand Prix on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Mercedes ace, who has a record 93 race wins, will be cham­pion again at the Is­tan­bul Park cir­cuit if his team­mate and sole ti­tle ri­val Valt­teri Bot­tas fails to score at least eight points.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old Bri­ton, who has 282 points, leads Bot­tas by 85, with 78 re­main­ing to be won af­ter Turkey when the sea­son heads to the Mid­dle East for a clos­ing triple header in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>That means sec­ond place would be enough even if Bot­tas wins, pro­vid­ing the Finn does not also take the bonus point for fastest lap.</p>
    <p>At its sim­plest, Hamilton just has to beat Bot­tas – some­thing he has done 10 times in 13 races this year.</p>
    <p>Hamilton, who al­ready holds records for most poles, podi­ums and points fin­ishes, has only twice fin­ished out of the top three this year, with a worst re­sult of seventh.</p>
    <p>He is on a record run of 46 suc­ces­sive scor­ing fin­ishes.</p>
    <p>Mercedes won the con­struc­tors’ ti­tle for an un­prece­dented seventh year in a row at Imola in Italy on Nov 1 and are as­sured of a seventh suc­ces­sive driv­ers’ crown as well.</p>
    <p>“We, as a team, have done such a re­mark­able job,” said Hamilton, re­mark­ing that the team ti­tle was “al­most bet­ter” than the driv­ers’.</p>
    <p>Hamilton, who has yet to sign a con­tract be­yond this sea­son, may feel dif­fer­ently on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Former Fer­rari ri­val Felipe Massa has no doubt that the English­man de­serves that “great­est of all time” so­bri­quet and a salary to match it.</p>
    <p>“Lewis can re­ally be the best of the best and every­body will say that for years and years, or maybe decades, or what­ever,” he said on the F1 Na­tion pod­cast.</p>
    <p>“So, I think he is just pre­par­ing his two- or three-year con­tract, which I think he de­serves.</p>
    <p>“What he is do­ing... He shows that he def­i­nitely de­serves it, to be dif­fer­ent to all of the other driv­ers in terms of ev­ery­thing and even in terms of salary.”</p>
    <p>The ti­tle race is the fo­cus but Turkey’s first race since 2011, as a re­place­ment to fill out a cham­pi­onship de­pleted by the Covid-19 pan­demic, will be wel­comed by all.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit, with its Turn 8 triple left-han­der, was al­ways a favourite among driv­ers even when crowds were small.</p>
    <p>This week­end the race will be held be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>“It’s a track that made for good rac­ing in the past, so it will be in­ter­est­ing to see how the mod­ern For­mula One cars do on it,” said Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Raikko­nen, who won the first Turk­ish Grand Prix for McLaren in 2005.</p>
    <p>The bat­tle to be best of the rest be­hind Mercedes and Red Bull is also on a knife’s edge, with just a point sep­a­rat­ing Re­nault, McLaren and Rac­ing Point.</p>
