    <p>As Covid-19 con­tin­ues to bat­ter economies and dec­i­mate jobs, gov­ern­ments around the world are seek­ing to share the fruits of labour more widely, and en­sure that their cit­i­zens are not ex­posed to un­bear­able losses.</p>
    <p>One strat­egy some so­ci­eties have adopted to safe­guard work­ers’ wel­fare is a min­i­mum wage, calls for which sur­faced in Par­lia­ment last month.</p>
    <p>An­other pro­posal floated in the House ear­lier this year was for a uni­ver­sal ba­sic income.</p>
    <p>One won­ders if there will be to and fro in the Cham­ber to­day on this topic when the debate on the Gov­ern­ment’s strat­egy to emerge stronger from the Covid-19 pan­demic re­sumes, but yes­ter­day’s sit­ting was a re­minder that restor­ing the econ­omy and cre­at­ing jobs ought to go be­yond set­ting a price floor if ef­forts are to be sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>Other ini­tia­tives, too, should not be ig­nored. On this, sev­eral MPs made a slew of sug­ges­tions.</p>
    <p>Labour MP Fahmi Ali­man (Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC) called for a re­view of the Work­fare Income Sup­ple­ment (WIS) Scheme to up­lift young low-wage work­ers, and a higher WIS pay­out to those work­ing in es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mr Fahmi asked the Gov­ern­ment to study if the as­sump­tion – that younger work­ers have more po­ten­tial to move up the ca­reer and wage lad­der – still holds, and con­sider low­er­ing the age el­i­gi­bil­ity to 30 years for work­ers to qual­ify for WIS.</p>
    <p>“While I do not dis­count that we should sup­port our older work­ers, it does stand to rea­son that our younger work­ers may have de­pen­dants, such as el­derly par­ents or young chil­dren, which can be a strain not only fi­nan­cially but also men­tally,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>An­other im­prove­ment, he added, could be to equalise the pay­out across dif­fer­ent age groups so long as they earn the same salary.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) re­it­er­ated sug­ges­tions to fine-tune the Self-Em­ployed Per­son Income Re­lief Scheme (Sirs).</p>
    <p>This could mean that those who are cur­rently not el­i­gi­ble – such as those who stay in pri­vate prop­erty with an an­nual value of more than $21,000 – could re­ceive a smaller pay­out.</p>
    <p>The scheme, which was an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat in the Re­silience Bud­get in March, pro­vides el­i­gi­ble self-em­ployed per­sons with $9,000 in cash over nine months.</p>
    <p>Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) stressed the need to re­design some jobs so that they come with greater re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and a com­men­su­rately higher salary.</p>
    <p>These would be a bet­ter fit for those with some se­nior­ity in their pre­vi­ous ca­reers, he said, and who have heav­ier fi­nan­cial and fam­ily com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, this year’s ex­per­i­ment with large-scale cash trans­fers and debt re­lief to house­holds has whet­ted the public’s appetite to re­write the so­cial con­tract in favour of more state sup­port.</p>
    <p>Sug­ges­tions made by sev­eral among the 21 MPs who spoke yes­ter­day sig­nal their keen recog­ni­tion that some Sin­ga­pore­ans will find it hard to stom­ach more dis­rup­tion with­out more risk-shar­ing.</p>
    <p>Progress Sin­ga­pore Party Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai may have said that “no strat­egy will be ef­fec­tive if Sin­ga­pore­ans are not con­vinced by the facts and fig­ures”, but the build­ing blocks are al­ready there.</p>
    <p>The Jobs Growth In­cen­tive, which dou­bles wage sub­si­dies for lo­cal hires aged 40 and above, for in­stance, is a game-changer to en­cour­age more in­clu­sive hir­ing.</p>
    <p>Ini­tia­tives such as Sirs have sparked think­ing on how the self-em­ployed can be bet­ter sup­ported.</p>
    <p>The Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme, as Mr Yip pointed out, can be fur­ther ex­panded to help ma­ture work­ers brush up their dig­i­tal skills.</p>
    <p>A whole suite of pos­si­ble per­mu­ta­tions ex­ist even within the cur­rent frame­work.</p>
    <p>And with the on­go­ing work of the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force, and con­ver­sa­tions held with Sin­ga­pore­ans and in­dus­try play­ers – now ex­panded to in­clude per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties – one can­not rule out the pos­si­bil­ity that the Gov­ern­ment might pull a few sur­prises yet in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, this year’s ex­per­i­ment with large-scale cash trans­fers and debt re­lief to house­holds has whet­ted the public’s appetite to re­write the so­cial con­tract in favour of more state sup­port. Sug­ges­tions made by sev­eral among the 21 MPs who spoke yes­ter­day sig­nal their keen recog­ni­tion that some Sin­ga­pore­ans will find it hard to stom­ach more dis­rup­tion with­out more risk-shar­ing.</p>
