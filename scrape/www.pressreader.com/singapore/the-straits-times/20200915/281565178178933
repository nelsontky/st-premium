    <p>The labour mar­ket is start­ing to feel the full force of the Covid-19 pan­demic, with re­trench­ments and unemployme­nt ris­ing in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year. Amid on­go­ing un­cer­tain­ties, ob­servers say that the labour mar­ket is likely to re­main weak for some time to come.</p>
    <p>The labour mar­ket is start­ing to feel the full force of the Covid-19 pan­demic, with re­trench­ments and unemployme­nt ris­ing in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>Amid on­go­ing un­cer­tain­ties, ob­servers said the labour mar­ket is likely to re­main weak for some time to come.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ments i n the three months to end-June more than dou­bled to 8,130 com­pared with the first quar­ter, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said yes­ter­day. In all, a to­tal of 11,350 peo­ple were laid off in the first half of the year, mak­ing it the worst show­ing since the global fi­nan­cial crisis of 2009.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure does not in­clude the large-scale lay­offs an­nounced by Resorts World Sen­tosa in July and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines last week, which af­fected thou­sands of work­ers.</p>
    <p>Lo­cals – re­fer­ring to Sin­ga­pore­ans and permanent res­i­dents – were less likely to be re­trenched than for­eign­ers, noted MOM. Lo­cals still ac­counted for a ma­jor­ity of those laid off be­cause they make up the bulk of the work­force.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts ex­pect unemployme­nt to climb fur­ther as lay­offs con­tinue through the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>“Re­trench­ments will likely con­tinue in the third quar­ter but may not be as mas­sive as in the sec­ond quar­ter when the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were im­posed,” said May­bank Kim Eng se­nior economist Chua Hak Bin.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said he ex­pects the un­cer­tain lo­cal and global out­look to weigh on the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>MOM said that cost-sav­ing mea­sures adopted by firms and gov­ern­ment sup­port ini­tia­tives may have cush­ioned the im­pact on jobs.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of em­ploy­ees placed on shorter work weeks or tem­po­rary lay­offs rose to an un­prece­dented high of 81,720 in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Lo­cals formed the bulk of the 42,190 em­ploy­ees on short work weeks, while for­eign­ers formed the ma­jor­ity of the 43,720 on tem­po­rary lay­offs.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, unemployme­nt rose steadily over the last few months.</p>
    <p>The sea­son­ally ad­justed unemployme­nt rate for Sin­ga­pore­ans climbed to 4.3 per cent in July, up from 4 per cent in June and 3.5 per cent in March. The rate for lo­cals was 4.1 per cent in July, while the over­all rate in­clud­ing for­eign­ers was 3 per cent.</p>
    <p>The lat­est fig­ures were the high­est since the global fi­nan­cial crisis in 2009.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the econ­omy shed a net 103,500 work­ers in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, ex­clud­ing for­eign domestic work­ers. This was the largest quar­terly contractio­n on record, though lower than the pre­lim­i­nary es­ti­mate of 121,800.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence arises be­cause the fi­nal re­port takes into ac­count late re­sponses from firms and any re­vi­sions they might make.</p>
    <p>To­tal employment in Sin­ga­pore con­tracted by 3.7 per cent, or 129,100, in the first half of the year. For­eign­ers ac­counted for more than half of this contractio­n.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the de­cline in lo­cal employment came from the ser­vice sec­tor, while the de­cline in for­eign employment was wide­spread across sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Even amid the gloom, lo­cal employment held steady or edged up in sec­tors such as in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, fi­nan­cial and in­sur­ance ser­vices and health and so­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>But over­all hir­ing de­mand con­tin­ued to fall. The ra­tio of job va­can­cies to un­em­ployed peo­ple fell from 0.71 in March to 0.57 in June. This means there are fewer than six va­can­cies for ev­ery 10 un­em­ployed peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has seen worse. This ra­tio was 0.37 in March 2009 amid the global fi­nan­cial crisis.</p>
    <p>Still, job va­can­cies grew in five sec­tors be­tween March and June: pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion and ed­u­ca­tion, ad­min­is­tra­tive and sup­port ser­vices, food and bev­er­age ser­vices, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and whole­sale trade.</p>
    <p>Lower-wage work­ers have been hit par­tic­u­larly hard by the fall­out of Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Those not in pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) jobs made up 49.2 per cent of lo­cals who were re­trenched in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est data re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day in its labour mar­ket re­port.</p>
    <p>This was up from 36.1 per cent in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Non-PMETs made up 41.7 per cent of all lo­cals – re­fer­ring to Sin­ga­pore­ans and permanent res­i­dents – in jobs last year, while PMETs made up 58.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is a marked change from the trend be­fore Covid-19, which saw PMETs mak­ing up a dis­pro­por­tion­ately large share of lo­cals who were re­trenched. For in­stance, in the fourth quar­ter of last year, 73.8 per cent of re­trenched lo­cals were in PMET jobs.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of younger work­ers aged be­low 40 among re­trenched lo­cals also grew to 35.3 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, up from 27.3 per cent in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank se­nior economist Irvin Seah said the i mpact on nonPMETs could be be­cause front-line work­ers have been badly af­fected by the crisis.</p>
    <p>“Re­trench­ments have now tipped against lower-skilled work­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The na­ture of the pan­demic has been to hit front-line jobs sig­nif­i­cantly more, which are also the ones that com­mand lower com­pen­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Seah said this is in line with the bank’s find­ings in a re­cent sur­vey re­port, which said that lower-in­come work­ers – those who earn less than $3,000 per month – make up al­most half of cus­tomers who have ex­pe­ri­enced a fall in salaries. Within this group, 51 per cent saw their in­comes fall by more than half.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior economist Chua Hak Bin also noted that gig work­ers – many of whom were badly af­fected by the cir­cuit breaker re­stric­tions and on­go­ing bor­der con­trols and so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules – prob­a­bly ac­count for a fair share of non-PMETs and younger peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Ex­tend­ing the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme, al­beit in a ta­pered and tar­geted form, will help cush­ion the gig work­ers in this re­ces­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah added that when it comes to younger peo­ple, em­ploy­ers may now be con­sid­er­ing fac­tors such as a lack of ex­pe­ri­ence, be­sides com­pen­sa­tion pack­ages.</p>
    <p>The labour mar­ket re­port yes­ter­day also showed that re­trench­ments and unemployme­nt rose in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 78,800 cit­i­zens and 10,900 PRs were un­em­ployed as of June. Most of them had joined the pool of un­em­ployed re­cently.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the num­ber of longterm un­em­ployed lo­cals dipped be­tween March and June. This refers to un­em­ployed peo­ple who were out of work for at least 25 weeks.</p>
    <p>But it is be­com­ing harder for re­trenched peo­ple to find new jobs quickly. The share of lo­cals re­trenched in the fourth quar­ter of last year who found a new job within six months fell to an all-time low of 58.4 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The share was l ower among PMETs than among non-PMETs.</p>
    <p>Time-re­lated un­der­em­ploy­ment rose among lo­cals, as there were more part-timers who were will­ing and avail­able to work ad­di­tional hours, said MOM in the re­port.</p>
    <p>Also, as a result of less over­time work, the av­er­age weekly to­tal paid</p>
    <p>hours worked per em­ployee fell by one hour be­tween March and June to 43.4 hours, the largest quar­terly de­cline on record.</p>
    <p>MOM said it will start to re­lease unemployme­nt rates on a monthly ba­sis, in­stead of quar­terly. This way, it can de­tect shifts in the employment sit­u­a­tion more quickly. It had started col­lect­ing unemployme­nt data monthly since April.</p>
    <p>The data will be avail­able online and in jobs sit­u­a­tion re­ports.</p>
