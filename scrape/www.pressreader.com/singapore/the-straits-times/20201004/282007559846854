    <p>•</p>
    <p>PARIS Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron of France has out­lined mea­sures de­signed to rein in the in­flu­ence of rad­i­cal Is­lam in the coun­try and help de­velop what he called an “Is­lam of France” com­pat­i­ble with the na­tion’s repub­li­can val­ues.</p>
    <p>In a long-awaited speech on the sub­ject, Mr Macron on Fri­day said the in­flu­ence of Is­lamism must be erad­i­cated from pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions even as he ac­knowl­edged gov­ern­ment fail­ures in let­ting it spread.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures in­clude plac­ing strin­gent lim­its on home school­ing and in­creas­ing scru­tiny of re­li­gious schools, mak­ing as­so­ci­a­tions that so­licit pub­lic funds sign a “char­ter” on sec­u­lar­ism. While these mea­sures would ap­ply to any group, they are in­tended to counter ex­trem­ists in the Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Un­der the mea­sures, the wide­spread prac­tice of bring­ing over for­eign imams to work in France, where they are of­ten ac­cused of preach­ing an out­dated or ex­treme ver­sion of Is­lam, would be ended.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of the ef­fects of Is­lamism has been a per­sis­tent one in France, amid fears of the kinds of ter­ror­ist at­tacks the coun­try has faced in re­cent years, putting pres­sure on Pres­i­dent Macron as he faces re­elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Many of the pro­pos­als from Mr Macron on Fri­day were ideas that had been floated in the past or ones he had al­ready ap­proved. His speech as­sem­bled it all into a com­pre­hen­sive pack­age that the gov­ern­ment is ex­pected to present as a Bill in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>“What we must at­tack is Is­lamist sep­a­ratism,” Mr Macron said in front of six of his min­is­ters in Les Mureaux, a town north-west of Paris. “Sec­u­lar­ism is the ce­ment of a united France,” he added, call­ing rad­i­cal Is­lam both an “ide­ol­ogy” and a “project” that sought to in­doc­tri­nate chil­dren, un­der­mine France’s val­ues – es­pe­cially gen­der equal­ity – and cre­ate a “counter-so­ci­ety” that some­times laid the ground­work for Is­lamist ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>But Mr Macron also recog­nised that France bore re­spon­si­bil­ity for let­ting that ide­ol­ogy spread un­con­tested. “We built our own sep­a­ratism our­selves,” he said.</p>
    <p>For too long, the au­thor­i­ties had amassed largely im­mi­grant pop­u­la­tions in poverty-stricken neigh­bour­hoods that had little ac­cess to jobs or pub­lic trans­porta­tion, lead­ing to a “ghet­toi­sa­tion of our re­pub­lic”, he said.</p>
    <p>The speech was post­poned sev­eral times this year as the Pres­i­dent searched, some­times pub­licly, for the best ap­proach and lan­guage. The stakes were high, as the set­ting in­di­cated: Mr Macron’s speech and an­swers to jour­nal­ists, which lasted nearly two hours, were broad­cast live on tele­vi­sion and the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>In a sign of how del­i­cate the is­sue is for Mr Macron, a mem­ber of his party walked out of a par­lia­men­tary hear­ing last month be­cause she ob­jected to the veil worn by a stu­dent union leader who was tes­ti­fy­ing, set­ting off days of heated de­bate.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, Mr Macron’s an­nounce­ment came as France’s po­lit­i­cal es­tab­lish­ment gears up for the next pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in 18 months.</p>
    <p>Ac­cused by both the far-right and tra­di­tional con­ser­va­tives of be­ing lax against rad­i­cal Is­lam, Pres­i­dent Macron has re­cently used words and adopted po­si­tions on so­cial is­sues that have sig­nalled a clear de­par­ture from his more lib­eral stances at the start of his term.</p>
    <p>Over the sum­mer, Mr Macron reshuf­fled his Cab­i­net with a view to­wards the next elec­tion, hand­ing a key job to Mr Ger­ald Dar­manin, a con­ser­va­tive, hard-charg­ing pro­tege of the for­mer right-wing pres­i­dent Ni­co­las Sarkozy.</p>
    <p>Mr Dar­manin, now the in­te­rior min­is­ter and head of the na­tional po­lice, has quickly helped set the tone for the re­main­der of Mr Macron’s term.</p>
    <p>Even though of­fi­cial data shows steady or de­clin­ing crime rates over­all in France, Mr Dar­manin joined po­lit­i­cal ri­vals on the right to de­nounce what they claim to be the coun­try’s sup­posed grow­ing in­se­cu­rity. Mr Dar­manin be­gan us­ing and strongly de­fend­ing the vo­cab­u­lary of the far right to describe a France sup­pos­edly “turn­ing sav­age” – or un­der­go­ing an “en­sauvage­ment”, a loaded word used by the right to tar­get non-white im­mi­grants from France’s for­mer African colonies.</p>
    <p>The tough talk on crime also helped set the stage for Mr Macron’s speech, which is likely to set off fierce de­bate over the com­ing months as law­mak­ers con­sider the Bill.</p>
    <p>It is also ex­pected to sharpen ten­sions within Mr Macron’s party, as the Pres­i­dent’s right­ward tilt has al­ready alien­ated its left-lean­ing mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“What we must at­tack is Is­lamist sep­a­ratism,” Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said. “Sec­u­lar­ism is the ce­ment of a united France,” he said, call­ing rad­i­cal Is­lam both an “ide­ol­ogy” and a “project” that sought to in­doc­tri­nate chil­dren, un­der­mine France’s val­ues – es­pe­cially gen­der equal­ity – and cre­ate a “coun­ter­so­ci­ety” that some­times laid the ground­work for Is­lamist ter­ror­ism.</p>
