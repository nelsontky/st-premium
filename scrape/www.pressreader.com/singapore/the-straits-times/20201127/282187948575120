    <p>Mr Ge­orge Matthews, 70, is the perfect do­cent for a po­lice bunker turned mu­seum in Pearl’s Hill.</p>
    <p>He has the his­tory of the place at his fingertips, hav­ing worked in it and lived nearby in the po­lice quar­ters for most of his life.</p>
    <p>The bomb-proof bunker sits along­side the Up­per Bar­racks, which is one of the at­trac­tions on the Po­lice Her­itage Trail, and was the nerve cen­tre for po­lice op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Called the Com­bined Op­er­a­tions Room, it also housed part of the po­lice’s ra­dio division, where Mr Matthews was based in the 1970s as a con­sta­ble.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tors of the 999 hot­line would re­lay in­for­ma­tion to Mr Matthews and his col­leagues, who would then head out in pa­trol cars to as­sess the sit­u­a­tion and re­port what they saw as the first re­spon­ders on the scene.</p>
    <p>Mr Matthews said he has re</p>
    <p>sponded to all sorts of in­ci­dents – from sui­cide at­tempts and armed rob­beries to house­break­ing in progress.</p>
    <p>“We were the eyes and the ears of the po­lice force,” said Mr Matthews, adding that there was never a dull moment.</p>
    <p>One mem­o­rable in­ci­dent in­volved a gang fight in Mandai Road.</p>
    <p>The gang­sters had scat­tered be­fore the po­lice ar­rived but did not have time to re­move a dead body, and Mr Matthews had to re­port this to head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>An­other in­ci­dent oc­curred when he re­sponded to a case of at­tempted sui­cide in Chin Swee Road.</p>
    <p>He took the ini­tia­tive to yank a woman off a ledge as she might have jumped in the time taken for him to re­port the mat­ter to head­quar­ters and wait for in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­tired in­spec­tor, who left the force in 1995, has been re­gal­ing vis­i­tors to the bunker with anec­dotes such as these, adding flavour to their tours.</p>
    <p>“Vis­i­tors are shocked that such a place ex­isted,” said Mr Matthews. “This place, for 60 years, has been pro­vid­ing safety and se­cu­rity for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
