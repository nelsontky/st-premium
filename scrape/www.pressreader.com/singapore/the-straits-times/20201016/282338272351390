    <p>For some­one as im­pec­ca­bly styled as Yoyo Cao, you would not ex­pect any­thing less from her per­sonal space and she cer­tainly does not dis­ap­point.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s most-pho­tographed street-style star greets me at the en­trance of her two-storey pent­house in New­ton in an ef­fort­lessly chic get-up of a white cotton tank worn with silk trousers in Burberry’s TB mono­gram and Dior Oblique slides.</p>
    <p>As the fash­ion de­signer and dig­i­tal en­tre­pre­neur, who has 405,000 fol­low­ers on In­sta­gram, ush­ers me into the liv­ing room, I no­tice the same TB print re­peated on a cushy throw slung over the arm of her couch.</p>
    <p>Her aes­thetic choices for her home clearly re­flect her fash­ion ones: con­sid­ered, but ul­ti­mately ef­fort­less.</p>
    <p>“We moved in last year, but it’s still not fully done. I’d rather spend time try­ing to find things I re­ally love in­stead of rush­ing into it,” she says of her dec­o­rat­ing process.</p>
    <p>She is mar­ried to Mr Matthews Chang, chief op­er­a­tions of­fi­cer of games de­vel­oper Tokigames. They have a two-year-old son, Luca.</p>
    <p>It may be a work in progress, but Cao, 32, def­i­nitely knows the end goal she has in mind.</p>
    <p>“I wanted some­thing min­i­mal and sim­ple; a space I can look at and be com­fort­able in for a long time, be­cause you have to look at your home ev­ery sin­gle day. But at the same time, I didn’t want it to be too plain or cold. I wanted to make it as cosy as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>To achieve that, she started with a base pal­ette of whites and of­fwhites, then sprin­kled warm colours, or­ganic tex­tures and rich ma­te­ri­als through­out.</p>
    <p>In the liv­ing room alone, a leather couch and leather chairs in cognac sit along­side a nubby, creamy arm­chair, rat­tan stools and side ta­bles – all ar­ranged around a cof­fee ta­ble in mar­ble and brass.</p>
    <p>Leafy greens and white blooms bring a bit of the out­doors in while mus­tard cush­ions and plush throws from Burberry and Dior add pops of colour and print. The en­tire room is grounded by a mas­sive rug from Mar­rakesh.</p>
    <p>“I was there last year for Dior’s cruise show and one of my friends took me to the ar­ti­sans who made the car­pets for that show – they do these beau­ti­ful one-off pieces.”</p>
    <p>The style of her liv­ing space is an ex­ten­sion of Cao’s per­sonal style, which she de­scribes as “eclec­tic and min­i­mal”.</p>
    <p>That sense of min­i­mal­ism comes through in the way she has en­gi­neered her home to be as clut­ter­free as pos­si­ble, with cus­tom cab­i­netry that looks like pan­elled walls but swings open to re­veal ap­pli­ances and stor­age space clev­erly hid­den away.</p>
    <p>The eclec­ti­cism (and Cao’s pas­sion for fash­ion) man­i­fests in the Loewe bas­kets and Louis Vuit­ton trunks of var­i­ous sizes that are placed all around the apart­ment – an aes­thetic choice rooted in func­tion­al­ity as well.</p>
    <p>“I put a lot of things in them so the place doesn’t look messy,” she says. “I’m not the ti­di­est per­son, but I don’t like see­ing clut­ter.”</p>
    <p>That same thought­ful­ness with which she ap­proaches her in­te­ri­ors ap­plies to her fash­ion prin­ci­ples these days too.</p>
    <p>“I ad­mit I was kind of ob­sessed with buy­ing a lot of dif­fer­ent things from all the lat­est col­lec­tions be­fore.</p>
    <p>“But now, with the pan­demic and ev­ery­thing else, you re­alise that there are cer­tain things you al­ways go back to in your wardrobe – the es­sen­tials. And I think that has made peo­ple re­think how they spend on cloth­ing; you want some­thing time­less and you want good qual­ity.”</p>
    <p>The pieces she finds her­self re­turn­ing to over and over are “things with mul­ti­ple uses; you can dress them up or down – a good black blazer, white T-shirts in cotton and silk, and a lot of denim. I’m al­ways in­vest­ing in good, washed denim. It doesn’t mat­ter if it’s de­signer or not. Some of the pieces I wear the most are vin­tage Levi’s.”</p>
    <p>I ask if moth­er­hood had played a part in that change of per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think my sense of style it­self has changed, but I’m def­i­nitely more prac­ti­cal now,” says Cao.</p>
    <p>“In the past, I would in­vest in a lot of run­way pieces that are quite dif­fi­cult to move around in. But now, I’m more of­ten in prac­ti­cal clothes so I can go out with Luca with­out think­ing, ‘Oh my god, can I do this?’”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ingly, the de­sign­ers she loves are the ones who get that blend of di­rec­tional edge and time­less wear­a­bil­ity right.</p>
    <p>“I still love Phoebe Philo’s Ce­line. The clothes are re­ally time­less and they’re not just pieces of cloth­ing; they’re con­fi­dence boost­ers.</p>
    <p>“You know you’re go­ing to look good and you can’t tell which sea­son or year they’re from. You know, some brands look good on, like, Cau­casians or mod­els only. As a pe­tite Asian, Philo’s Ce­line is per­fect for me.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “I’m also very i nto Chanel be­cause it’s very clas­sic – you buy a jacket and you can wear it your whole life. I’m also ob­sessed with the his­tory of the house and the ar­ti­sans be­hind it.”</p>
    <p>One of her favourite de­sign­ers is Ni­co­las Gh­esquiere, cre­ative direc­tor of Louis Vuit­ton.</p>
    <p>“No one does fu­tur­is­tic as well as he does. Look­ing at his run­way shows, you’d think those pieces are im­pos­si­ble to wear, but when you break down the looks, the pieces are ac­tu­ally re­ally wear­able.”</p>
    <p>Her love of Gh­esquiere can be seen most ev­i­dently from her shoe col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked about the num­ber of pairs she owns, Cao is stumped for an an­swer while her hus­band jok­ingly states: “Too many!”</p>
    <p>They are shelved away floor-to­ceil­ing all along the en­try hall­way, hid­den be­hind those same cus­tom cab­i­nets found in the liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>“I don’t have any more stor­age, so I’ve had to give some away,” Cao says. “I don’t wear all of them, but the ones I keep, I keep be­cause I re­ally love the col­lec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Point­ing to two en­tire shelves of Louis Vuit­ton boots, she con­tin­ues: “They’re from the col­lec­tions I’m re­ally ob­sessed with – I can tell you which ex­act col­lec­tions they’re from. I see them as col­lec­tor’s items rather than some­thing to wear.”</p>
    <p>That col­lec­tor’s in­stinct is on full dis­play through the apart­ment. In her son’s room are stuffed toys and teddy bears from the likes of Dior, Fendi, Gen­tle Mon­ster, Kaws, Sa­cai, Supreme and Un­der­cover.</p>
    <p>On the stair land­ing that leads to the mas­ter bed­room on the sec­ond floor, she has placed a Chanel skate­board and bas­ket­ball along­side prints and pho­to­graphs. A pair of Chanel rack­ets sits on the cus­tom wood-and-weave­work dress­ing ta­ble in her bed­room.</p>
    <p>“When I go to Paris, I don’t nec­es­sar­ily go to Chanel to buy shoes or clothes. I like col­lectible things be­cause I feel they cre­ate this unique­ness in your home and show more of your char­ac­ter.”</p>
    <p>And that is how a fash­ion star cre­ates a truly fash­ion­able home.</p>
