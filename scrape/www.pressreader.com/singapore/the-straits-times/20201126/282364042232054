    <p>The upcoming vac­cines may take some time to in­stil herd im­mu­nity, but they have cer­tainly put an ex­piry date on the eco­nomic down­turn and fi­nan­cial chaos sparked by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ahead of a more po­tent eco­nomic growth take-off, markets from Sin­ga­pore to the United States have al­ready started to reprice as­sets from equities to cur­ren­cies and bonds.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts are rec­om­mend­ing that in­vestors start ac­cu­mu­lat­ing stocks of the worst-hit sec­tors such as hos­pi­tal­ity and avi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>They ex­pect cur­ren­cies of trade-driven Asian economies, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s, to strengthen against the US dol­lar.</p>
    <p>Wall Street ral­lied on Tues­day – with the S&P 500 in­dex clos­ing at a record above 3,600 points and the Dow Jones breach­ing the 30,000 mark – as un­cer­tain­ties over the US elec­tion gave way to news of US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s Cab­i­net picks.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket cheered in par­tic­u­lar the nom­i­na­tion of for­mer Fed­eral Re­serve chair­man Janet Yellen as the next Trea­sury sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>Asian ob­servers hope Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory will usher in a White House that is more rules-based and pre­dictable and less hos­tile in its deal­ings with China.</p>
    <p>“There is a strong case for re­turn to nor­malcy af­ter a tu­mul­tuous 2020 that was gripped by the Covid-19 out­break,” DBS Bank’s chief econ­o­mist Taimur Baig said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Markets will run ahead of the real econ­omy, as they em­brace a year of vac­ci­na­tion for large seg­ments of hu­man­ity and more ef­fec­tive treat­ments for Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The global econ­omy will also re­bound next year, even though a full eco­nomic re­cov­ery to pre-Covid-19 lev­els will take some time, Dr Baig noted.</p>
    <p>Global con­sul­tant McKin­sey said in a re­port ear­lier this week that the pos­i­tive read­outs from the vac­cine tri­als in the US have sig­nif­i­cantly re­duced the un­cer­tainty about the time­line of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the United States will most likely reach herd im­mu­nity in the third or fourth quar­ter of next year, it said.</p>
    <p>An ear­lier transition to nor­malcy, prob­a­bly by the be­gin­ning of sum­mer in the north­ern hemi­sphere, is pos­si­ble with ad­di­tional help from new treat­ments and the ben­e­fits of sea­son­al­ity, it said.</p>
    <p>With the prover­bial light at the end of the tun­nel re­gard­ing the pan­demic, and with gov­ern­ments still pre­pared to sup­port their economies with even more fis­cal mea­sures, cap­i­tal markets are likely to rally even more strongly in the com­ing weeks and months.</p>
    <p>The ral­lies will get more sup­port as economies across the world re­bound in earnest next year.</p>
    <p>Credit Suisse, in its global outlook 2021 re­leased yes­ter­day, said that as de­mand con­tin­ues to im­prove fol­low­ing the 2020 re­ces­sion, the global econ­omy is ex­pected to grow by 4.2 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>Mr John Woods, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer for Asia-Pa­cific at Credit Suisse, said non-Ja­pan Asia is ex­pected to grow 4.4 per cent next year, af­ter a bruis­ing 2020.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia is pro­jected to grow faster, partly due to a deeper con­trac­tion this year and a later start to its re­cov­ery, but also be­cause of a greater ca­pac­ity to ben­e­fit from any vac­cine treat­ment and a sub­se­quent grad­ual re­cov­ery in tourism, he said.</p>
    <p>Asia’s abil­ity to stage a rel­a­tively stronger re­cov­ery and a weaker outlook for the US dol­lar would ben­e­fit the re­gion’s cur­ren­cies, said the in­vest­ment bank’s chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Ray Far­ris at a brief­ing of the outlook re­port in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Credit Suisse ex­pects that the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar might be al­lowed to ap­pre­ci­ate grad­u­ally against the US dol­lar and on a nom­i­nal ef­fec­tive ex­change rate (Neer) ba­sis.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the phas­ing out of do­mes­tic fis­cal sup­port is likely to prompt some cau­tion from the mon­e­tary au­thor­i­ties in the ear­lier months of next year, it noted.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank also ex­pects the Neer to have an up­ward drift, putting down­ward pres­sure on do­mes­tic in­ter­est rates in the process.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try un­veiled its maiden 2021 growth fore­cast of 4 per cent to 6 per cent this week.</p>
    <p>Stim­u­lus mea­sures im­ple­mented since the start of the pan­demic, to­gether with the eco­nomic re­cov­ery, will sup­port risk as­sets in the year ahead, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>At the fore­front of the re­cov­ery trade will be stocks of com­pa­nies that have suf­fered the most this year and are thus avail­able at bar­gain prices.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank an­a­lyst Paul Yong said: “Pos­i­tive news on a Covid-19 vac­cine pro­vides light at the end of the tun­nel for in­ter­na­tional air travel.”</p>
    <p>That bodes well for Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) and and ground han­dler Sats.</p>
    <p>While SIA shares have al­ready ral­lied, Sats is still trad­ing at com­pelling val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Bank of Sin­ga­pore head of in­vest­ment strat­egy Eli Lee said in­vestors should fo­cus on non-Ja­pan Asian equities , which will ben­e­fit from fur­ther US dol­lar weak­ness ahead and a resur­gent Chi­nese econ­omy which is lead­ing global growth.</p>
    <p>He added that more in­vest­ments are likely to be ro­tated into div­i­dend-pay­ing value stocks – banks and real es­tate – from growth stocks such as tech­nol­ogy.</p>
