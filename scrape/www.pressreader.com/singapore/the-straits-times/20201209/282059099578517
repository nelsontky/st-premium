    <p>While many fresh grad­u­ates worry about find­ing em­ploy­ment dur­ing the pan­demic, Mr Daniel Ez­zra Adly Mo­hamed has not only se­cured a job as a field en­gi­neer, but also topped his co­hort at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE).</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel, 23, was the top trainee in the se­cu­rity sys­tems en­gi­neer­ing work-study diploma course. He had the best aca­demic grades and the top per­for­mance on the job as rated by em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he re­ceived a course medal from Sec­ond Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ma­liki Os­man at a vir­tual cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>The course was one of four of­fered un­der ITE’s work-study tech­ni­cal diploma pro­gramme when it was launched in 2018.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 62 trainees from se­cu­rity sys­tems en­gi­neer­ing, re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion care, as well as me­chan­i­cal and elec­tri­cal ser­vices su­per­vi­sion were among the pi­o­neer batch who com­pleted their train­ing in Oc­to­ber and re­ceived the work-study diploma.</p>
    <p>Trainees from the marine and off­shore en­gi­neer­ing course will grad­u­ate in April next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel said: “The 70-30 split (in terms of job train­ing and class­room learn­ing re­spec­tively) is very good.</p>
    <p>“At work, I learnt in­ter­per­sonal skills, cus­tomer re­la­tions and how to be pro­fes­sional in the work field, while ITE gave me a ba­sic foun­da­tion of knowl­edge... When I went to work sites, it felt more fa­mil­iar and not so for­eign.”</p>
    <p>As a field en­gi­neer at Cer­tis Tech­nol­ogy (Sin­ga­pore), his role en­tails vis­it­ing cus­tomers’ sites to help them main­tain equip­ment such as se­cu­rity cam­eras and ac­cess con­trol sys­tems.</p>
    <p>He is glad to have se­cured a job in a year when some grad­u­ates may be strug­gling.</p>
    <p>“I feel like I took the right step from the be­gin­ning... This pro­gramme kills two birds with one stone be­cause you get to fur­ther your ed­u­ca­tion while work­ing and draw­ing a full-time salary.” Jo­lene Ang</p>
