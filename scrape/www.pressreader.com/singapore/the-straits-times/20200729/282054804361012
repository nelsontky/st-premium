    <p>Chil­dren hop­ing to clinch a place at 22 pri­mary schools in the fourth of seven phases of Pri­mary 1 reg­is­tra­tion for next year will have to face a bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Th­ese schools in­clude Fair­field Methodist School (Pri­mary), with 51 chil­dren ap­ply­ing for 25 spots; Holy In­no­cents’ Pri­mary, with 58 chil­dren eye­ing 41 va­can­cies; and Nanyang Pri­mary, which has 48 chil­dren vy­ing for 21 slots.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said on its web­site yes­ter­day that for th­ese 22 schools, bal­lot­ing will be con­ducted for Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens who live within 1km, between 1km and 2km, or more than 2km, from the school.</p>
    <p>The re­sults will be out to­mor­row. Phase 2B is for chil­dren whose par­ents are school vol­un­teers, ac­tive com­mu­nity lead­ers or have ties to church or clan as­so­ci­a­tions di­rectly con­nected with the schools.</p>
    <p>An­other two schools, CHIJ Pri­mary (Toa Payoh) and Kuo Chuan Pres­by­te­rian Pri­mary, are over­sub­scribed at this stage.</p>
    <p>MOE said the schools only have places for Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen chil­dren re­sid­ing within 1km and 2km of the school re­spec­tively, and no bal­lot­ing will be con­ducted.</p>
    <p>When there are more reg­is­trants than va­can­cies in a school, pri­or­ity is given based on how near the chil­dren live to it. Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens also get pri­or­ity over per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren whose ap­pli­ca­tions are un­suc­cess­ful can reg­is­ter again in their next el­i­gi­ble phase.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 97 out of 186 pri­mary schools this year have filled more than half of their Pri­mary 1 places so far. Last year, 83 pri­mary schools were more than half-full at this point.</p>
    <p>The next is Phase 2C, which is con­sid­ered the most com­pet­i­tive as it is for chil­dren with no ties to the schools. It usu­ally sees the most num­ber of schools need­ing a bal­lot com­pared with ear­lier stages of the ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion for Phase 2C starts next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>From this year’s ex­er­cise, MOE will also be in­tro­duc­ing a cap on the in­take of PR chil­dren in pri­mary schools. The cap will be about 25 per cent to 30 per cent of a school’s planned Pri­mary 1 in­take, and will be ap­plied only in Phase 2C and 2C Sup­ple­men­tary in 10 schools.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion has been moved com­pletely on­line in the light of safe-dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 97 out of 186 pri­mary schools this year have filled more than half of their Pri­mary 1 places so far. Last year, 83 pri­mary schools were more than half-full at this point.</p>
