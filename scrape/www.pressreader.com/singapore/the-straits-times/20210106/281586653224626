    <p>Speed­post Ex­press and Speed­post Econ­omy are still avail­able, as is sur­face mail ser­vice.</p>
    <p>All air­mail ser­vices – in­clud­ing Speed­post pri­or­ity ser­vice – to the United King­dom and des­ti­na­tions that tran­sit via the UK have been sus­pended un­til fur­ther no­tice, due to the sus­pen­sion of flights go­ing there from Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to SingPost in an an­nounce­ment last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Speed­post Ex­press and Speed­post Econ­omy are still avail­able, as is sur­face mail ser­vice.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries by The Straits Times, a spokesman for SingPost said that Speed­post Ex­press is ful­filled by a third-party courier ser­vice with a ded­i­cated air trans­port net­work, and hence is not af­fected by the sus­pen­sion of air ser­vices.</p>
    <p>He said: “Air­lines have grad­u­ally re­sumed ser­vice since the be­gin­ning of this week, which means that we will be re­sum­ing ser­vice to the UK very soon.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, cus­tomers should note that de­lays may be ex­pected due to ca­pac­ity con­straints and lo­cal con­di­tions in the UK.”</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that af­fected SingPost ser­vices to the UK are ex­pected to re­sume to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery of air­mail takes three to 12 busi­ness days, while sur­face mail takes three to 17 weeks.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish postal ser­vice Royal Mail Group has also made changes to its de­liv­ery process since March last year, such as al­low­ing an elec­tronic ac­knowl­edge­ment of items in dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances as op­posed to sig­na­ture on de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a ser­vice sta­tus up­date on the SingPost web­site, Royal Mail Group said it can “no longer guar­an­tee ser­vice de­liv­ery stan­dards, in view of the UK gov­ern­ment in­tro­duc­ing a se­ries of mea­sures, in­clud­ing self-iso­la­tion, so­cial dis­tanc­ing, ad­vis­ing peo­ple to work from home and re­strict­ing travel with a view to min­imis­ing the spread of Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>Speed­post is SingPost’s ex­press de­liv­ery ser­vice, of­fer­ing de­liv­ery of doc­u­ments, parcels and freight within Sin­ga­pore as well as in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ies by Speed­post Ex­press take about one to three work­ing days, while Speed­post Pri­or­ity takes about two to 14 work­ing days for de­liv­ery to ma­jor cities.</p>
    <p>Speed­post Econ­omy de­liv­er­ies are shipped and take three to 15 work­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>The wors­en­ing coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion in the UK has led to bans and re­stric­tions on travel from the UK.</p>
    <p>Long-term pass hold­ers and short-term vis­i­tors with re­cent travel history to the UK have been barred from en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore since 11.59pm on Dec 23, fol­low­ing the dis­cov­ery of a new highly in­fec­tious coro­n­avirus strain in the UK.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to SingPost’s web­site, postal ser­vices to other ar­eas, such as Hong Kong and the United States, have also been dis­rupted due to the pan­demic.</p>
