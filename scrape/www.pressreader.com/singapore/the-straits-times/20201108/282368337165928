    <p>Bar­ra­mundi Asia, which owns the Kuhlbarra fish farm, saw more than half of its sales dis­ap­pear dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. It had de­pended heav­ily on sales to ho­tels such as Ma­rina Bay Sands and Grand Hy­att, as well as restau­rants like Labyrinth, Can­dlenut and Naked Finn.</p>
    <p>To stay afloat, it turned to home de­liv­er­ies of its fresh bar­ra­mundi sold mainly through its on­line store.</p>
    <p>The prod­uct also re­tails at most Cold Stor­age stores, Hu­ber’s Butch­ery, The Fish­wives and on­line gro­cery store Red­mart.</p>
    <p>On­line sales spiked dur­ing the bouts of panic buy­ing sparked by the move to Dorscon orange in Fe­bru­ary and when Malaysia im­posed its move­ment con­trol or­der the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>Since Septem­ber, the com­pany has been sell­ing its fresh fish maw on­line, pre­vi­ously sold only to ho­tels and Chi­nese restau­rants like the TungLok Group. It also launched cooked prod­ucts like teriyaki bar­ra­mundi and stock made with fish bones.</p>
    <p>Over­all sales have since picked up about 10 per cent from its low­est point, says chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer Charis Chua. But di­rect con­sumer sales con­tinue to make up half of the busi­ness as sales from ho­tels and restau­rants re­main slow. Be­fore the pan­demic, di­rect con­sumer sales was 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>An­other rev­enue stream that was hit was the ex­ports – to the United States, South Korea, Hong Kong, Thai­land and Malaysia. The mar­ket, which Kuhlbarra has built up in the past three years, is only just re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Kuhlbarra, which farms only bar­ra­mundi for economies of scale and be­cause it finds the fish more sus­tain­able than other va­ri­eties, has three farms in the</p>
    <p>open sea south of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The wa­ter tem­per­a­ture there is op­ti­mal for bar­ra­mundi,” says Ms Chua. “And the strong cur­rents in the deep sea mean waste doesn’t col­lect at the bot­tom. The fish also have to swim harder, so the meat gets firmer.”</p>
    <p>The farms now span 19.5ha, com­pared with just 7.5ha when Bar­ra­mundi Asia started in 2008.</p>
    <p>The an­nual har­vest has also grown to 700 tonnes, com­pared with 400 tonnes three years ago.</p>
    <p>With pro­duc­tion grow­ing and de­mand sink­ing dur­ing Covid-19, a sur­plus sur­faced.</p>
    <p>“We had to think of new ways to fully utilise the fish and be very nim­ble,” Ms Chua says.</p>
    <p>One method is freez­ing the fish but only for ex­port. A big cus­tomer is Sun Bas­ket in the US, which sells home de­liv­ery meals.</p>
    <p>Ms Chua says the big­gest chal­lenge is keep­ing prices com­pet­i­tive with those of im­ports from Malaysia and In­done­sia as pro­duc­tion cost is high.</p>
    <p>“We farm our bar­ra­mundi eth­i­cally and sus­tain­ably with­out com­pro­mis­ing on qual­ity. We are the only farm in Sin­ga­pore with an in­house vet­eri­nar­ian sci­ence team that mon­i­tors the health of our fish daily.”</p>
    <p>On the “30 by 30” goal, she re­veals that Bar­ra­mundi Asia plans to farm more than 5,000 tonnes of fish lo­cally by 2030 – equiv­a­lent to the to­tal vol­ume cur­rently pro­duced here.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has an­other farm in Aus­tralia and is plan­ning one in Brunei.</p>
    <p>“As­sum­ing that fish con­sump­tion in Sin­ga­pore plateaus at around 90,000 tonnes, 5,000 tonnes of bar­ra­mundi will be equiv­a­lent to 6 per cent of the to­tal con­sump­tion here,” she adds.</p>
