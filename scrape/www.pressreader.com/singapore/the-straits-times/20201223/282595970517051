    <p>Won­ton noo­dle spe­cial­ist Mak’s Noo­dle will be shut­ting its flag­ship – and last re­main­ing – out­let in Sin­ga­pore at The Cen­tre­point mall on Feb 28 next year.</p>
    <p>The brand is best known for its thin springy noo­dles and plump won­tons filled with chunky prawn in flavour­ful soup. Mak’s Noo­dle orig­i­nated in Guangzhou, China in 1920, but its founder moved to Hong Kong dur­ing World War II.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on its Facebook and In­sta­gram ac­counts, Mak’s Noo­dle says it is “un­able to come to an agree­ment for lease re­newal with the mall man­age­ment”.</p>
    <p>Call­ing the clo­sure a “dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion”, it adds: “Through­out these years, it has never been easy to main­tain the au­then­tic taste of Mak’s Noo­dle. We had to over­come chal­lenges in sourc­ing and im­port­ing Hong Kong in­gre­di­ents as well as high food costs.”</p>
    <p>Its out­let at The Cen­tre­point, which opened five years ago, was its first in Sin­ga­pore and a joint ven­ture with food and bev­er­age (F&B) com­pany Asia Gourmet.</p>
    <p>Mak’s Noo­dle used to have branches at VivoCity and West­gate, but both have since closed. Asia Gourmet con­verted the West­gate out­let i nto an­other Hong Kong-style cha chaan teng – Honolulu Cafe – in 2018.</p>
    <p>De­spite the pend­ing clo­sure of The Cen­tre­point out­let, there are plans to re­tain the brand in Sin­ga­pore at a “suit­able lo­ca­tion”, says Mak’s Noo­dle’s gen­eral man­ager Lee Cheng Ling.</p>
    <p>Also shut­ting next year is Mediter­ranean restau­rant Sum­mer­long, af­ter four years at Robert­son Quay. Its last day of oper­a­tions is Jan 10.</p>
    <p>Other re­cent restau­rant clo­sures in­clude Can­tonese restau­rant-bar Sum Yi Tai in Boon Tat Street, both the Sun­tec City and Cir­cu­lar Road out­lets of Tai­wanese restau­rant The Salted Plum, and North­ern In­dian restau­rant Ki­nara’s out­let in Hol­land Vil­lage. Ki­nara’s other branches – in­clud­ing the ones in Boat Quay and Up­per East Coast Road – are still op­er­at­ing.</p>
    <p>On the im­pend­ing clo­sure of Mak’s Noo­dle, Mr Fran­cis Poulose, manag­ing di­rec­tor of food and bev­er­age con­sul­tancy Poulose As­so­ciates, says that it is a “good prod­uct in the wrong lo­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>He ob­serves that the over­all F&B scene is “not do­ing badly” and that the spate of clo­sures is not solely be­cause of the pan­demic. “It can be a mix­ture of many fac­tors such as lack of mar­ket­ing, poor lo­ca­tion, high rental, shift in cus­tomer base, re­duced ca­pac­i­ties and whether the eater­ies have adapted to the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“You see high-end restau­rants with long wait­ing lists and cafes with queues to en­ter. Peo­ple are still din­ing out and spend­ing money on food.”</p>
