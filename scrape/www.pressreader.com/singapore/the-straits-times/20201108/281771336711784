    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Johnny Depp has been forced out of the Fan­tas­tic Beasts movie fran­chise, days after los­ing a li­bel case in Bri­tain against a tabloid that branded him a “wife beater”.</p>
    <p>The A-list ac­tor, writ­ing on In­sta­gram on Fri­day, said that AT&T’s Warner Bros movie stu­dio had asked him to leave his role as vil­lain Gellert Grindel­wald.</p>
    <p>“I have re­spected and agreed to that re­quest,” he said.</p>
    <p>Warner Bros said in a state­ment that Depp “will de­part the Fan­tas­tic Beasts fran­chise”, and that his role would be re­cast.</p>
    <p>Depp re­cently re­sumed pro­duc­tion on the third film in the spinoff from Harry Pot­ter au­thor J. K. Rowl­ing.</p>
    <p>Warner Bros said on Fri­day that the film’s re­lease date had been pushed back to the sum­mer of 2022 from next Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Rowl­ing – her­self a sur­vivor of do­mes­tic abuse – de­clined to comment on Depp’s de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>His exit marked a rel­a­tively rare move by Hol­ly­wood to re­cast an ac­tor on eth­i­cal grounds.</p>
    <p>Kevin Spacey’s role in All The Money In The World was reshot with Christo­pher Plum­mer in 2017 after Spacey was ac­cused by more than 20 men of sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>Spacey has not com­mented since mak­ing an apol­ogy to his first ac­cuser.</p>
    <p>Char­lie Sheen was fired in 2011 from television’s top-rated sit­com, Two And A Half Men, after months of drink- and drug-fu­elled par­ty­ing. He was re­placed by Ash­ton Kutcher.</p>
    <p>Depp, 57, who plans to ap­peal against the Lon­don li­bel judg­ment, wrote that his “life and ca­reer will not be de­fined by this mo­ment”.</p>
    <p>The Pi­rates Of The Caribbean star had sued the pub­lish­ers of The Sun news­pa­per after it said he had been vi­o­lent to­wards his for­mer wife, ac­tress Am­ber Heard, 34.</p>
    <p>The news­pa­per also ques­tioned his cast­ing in the Fan­tas­tic Beasts fran­chise.</p>
    <p>The three-week li­bel trial in July heard ev­i­dence from both Depp and Heard about a tem­pes­tu­ous mar­riage marked by vi­o­lence on both sides, and of heavy drink­ing by Depp. A Bri­tish judge last Mon­day ruled against Depp.</p>
    <p>“I ac­cept that Mr Depp put her in fear of her life,” the judge wrote in a state­ment dis­miss­ing the case.</p>
    <p>He said the pa­per had shown that the claims it pub­lished were “sub­stan­tially true”.</p>
    <p>Rowl­ing had come un­der fire in 2017 for cast­ing Depp in the first Fan­tas­tic Beasts movie after ini­tial de­tails of his 2016 divorce from Heard were made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Rowl­ing said at the time that the cir­cum­stances of the divorce were a pri­vate mat­ter. Warner Bros also said in 2017 that it sup­ported the de­ci­sion to keep Depp.</p>
    <p>The Fan­tas­tic Beasts movies, based on the ad­ven­tures of Newt Sca­man­der, are set about 60 years be­fore the Harry Pot­ter films but fea­ture some of the same key char­ac­ters when they were younger.</p>
    <p>The first two of five planned films earned US$1.5 bil­lion (S$2.02 bil­lion) at the global box of­fice, ac­cord­ing to Box Of­fice Mojo.</p>
    <p>I have re­spected and agreed to that re­quest.</p>
