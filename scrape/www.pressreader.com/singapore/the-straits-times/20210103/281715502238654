    <p>JOHOR BARU • The Johor govern­ment is hope­ful that the high­speed rail (HSR) project will be con­tin­ued, even if it is not linked to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Johor Men­teri Be­sar Hasni Mo­ham­mad said yes­ter­day that the HSR project could still bring huge ben­e­fits to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He added that Johor would be the project’s main ben­e­fi­ciary, as most of the HSR de­vel­op­ment would be in the state.</p>
    <p>He said that al­though Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin an­nounced that the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore HSR project has been ter­mi­nated, Johor Umno is hope­ful that it can re­sume in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, we also are not rul­ing out the pos­si­bil­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s in­volve­ment in the new project in terms of in­vest­ment,” Datuk Hasni told a press con­fer­ence at the Johor Umno of­fice.</p>
    <p>Separately, Umno’s youth wing said it was dis­ap­pointed by the de­ci­sion to ter­mi­nate the HSR project con­nect­ing Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The can­cel­la­tion of a high-im­pact in­fra­struc­ture project which has a mul­ti­plier ef­fect is a step back and coun­ter­pro­duc­tive in the ef­forts to re­vive the econ­omy postCovid-19,” Umno Youth chief Asyraf Wa­jdi Dusuki said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment af­ter the HSR ter­mi­na­tion was an­nounced on Fri­day, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Depart­ment Mustapa Mo­hamed said the govern­ment would un­der­take a de­tailed study to ex­plore all pos­si­ble op­tions, in­clud­ing the vi­a­bil­ity of a do­mes­tic HSR project and its ben­e­fits to Malaysians.</p>
    <p>The 350km line would have run from a ter­mi­nal sta­tion in Ban­dar Malaysia, in down­town Kuala Lumpur, to a ter­mi­nal in Sin­ga­pore’s Jurong area.</p>
    <p>There has been spec­u­la­tion in the me­dia that the fed­eral govern­ment would con­tinue with the HSR project from Kuala Lumpur, with its ter­mi­nal sta­tion in Johor Baru.</p>
    <p>Mr Hasni said that even though the new HSR route did not in­volve a sta­tion in the is­land repub­lic, the project would still ben­e­fit Malaysians.</p>
    <p>He urged the fed­eral govern­ment to in­volve Johor in study­ing any new HSR project, in­clud­ing iden­ti­fy­ing new lo­ca­tions for the sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Johor Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat deputy chief Jimmy Puah Wee Tse said ter­mi­na­tion of the KL-Sin­ga­pore HSR project was a “missed op­por­tu­nity” not only for Johor but Malaysia as well.</p>
    <p>The project could have been a game changer and a great eco­nomic cat­a­lyst if it was man­aged well from the start, rather than with Malaysia hav­ing to pay com­pen­sa­tion of mil­lions of ring­git to Sin­ga­pore, he said, as quoted by Malay Mail on­line news.</p>
