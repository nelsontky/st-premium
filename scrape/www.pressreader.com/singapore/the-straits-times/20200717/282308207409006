    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The Hous­ton Rock­ets and its bil­lion­aire owner Til­man Fer­titta are su­ing their in­surer for deny­ing the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) fran­chise’s bid to tap its busi­ness-in­ter­rup­tion in­sur­ance pol­icy over rev­enue losses from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Rocket Ball and Clutch City Sports & En­ter­tain­ment, the re­spec­tive hold­ing com­pa­nies for the team, and Toy­ota Cen­tre, where the Rock­ets play, sued Af­fil­i­ated FM In­sur­ance, a divi­sion of FM Global, on Wed­nes­day in a state court in Rhode Is­land.</p>
    <p>The suit is the first by an NBA team seek­ing to re­cover losses tied to the eco­nomic body blows wrought by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The league has been sus­pended since March and no fur­ther games will be held at the Toy­ota Cen­tre this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Rock­ets are in­stead in Or­lando, Florida, where the com­pe­ti­tion is set to re­sume on July 30 at Dis­ney World, al­though guard Russell West­brook has yet to join their train­ing camp af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Fer­titta said in court fil­ings he paid around US$719,000 (S$1 mil­lion) in an­nual pre­mi­ums for more than US$400 mil­lion in busi­ness-in­ter­rup­tion in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>He added the pol­icy cov­ers the pan­demic be­cause it was not specif­i­cally ex­cluded and the law­suit con­tends loss of use of the arena con­sti­tutes “phys­i­cal dam­age”, trig­ger­ing the cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>“The prop­erty has been i mpaired,” the team’s lawyers said in the com­plaint. “The loss of func­tion­al­ity is no less phys­i­cal than the im­pact of a prop­erty hav­ing lost its roof to a tor­nado or hur­ri­cane.”</p>
    <p>Steven Zenof­sky, a spokesman for FM Global, de­clined to com­ment on the Rock­ets’ suit.</p>
    <p>Fer­titta, who also owns the Golden Nugget casino in Las Ve­gas and the Landry’s restau­rant chain, joins more than 50 other busi­nesses across the US who have sued in­sur­ers for deny­ing claims on busi­ness-in­ter­rup­tion poli­cies, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>The stakes in this wave of busi­ness-in­ter­rup­tion cases are high for in­sur­ers, who say such poli­cies were in­tended only for phys­i­cal dam­age and were never priced to cover a global virus out­break, and many specif­i­cally ex­clude pan­demics.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ers are fac­ing as much as US$100 bil­lion in losses from the pan­demic, Wells Fargo & Co. an­a­lyst El­yse Greenspan has es­ti­mated.</p>
