    <p>LON­DON • Marcelo Bielsa in­sisted Pa­trick Bam­ford de­serves all the credit for trans­form­ing his ca­reer af­ter the striker’s hat-trick in­spired a 3-0 win at As­ton Villa on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Bam­ford, who scored his three goals in 19 min­utes, had only one goal in 27 Premier League ap­pear­ances be­fore this sea­son but he al­ready has six in six games this term.</p>
    <p>The hat-trick pro­vided a sweet mo­ment for the 27-year-old, who en­dured a long and wind­ing road to the top en­dur­ing long-run­ning crit­i­cism of his fin­ish­ing.</p>
    <p>He had seven loan spells dur­ing his time as a Chelsea youth academy grad­u­ate be­fore mov­ing to Mid­dles­brough, then fi­nally find­ing his feet un­der Bielsa’s tute­lage at Leeds.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dream come true. When the third went in it was ela­tion. I will be telling my kids about this,” Bam­ford said af­ter be­com­ing only the sec­ond player to score in each of the Whites’ open­ing three topflight away games since Gor­don Hodg­son in 1937-38.</p>
    <p>“It is tes­ta­ment to how the team has worked. With­out them I wouldn’t be able to score.</p>
    <p>“Marcelo has put a lot of trust in me. I have a man­ager who be­lieves in me and as long as I keep work­ing hard he will keep trust­ing me.”</p>
    <p>While Bam­ford recog­nises Bielsa’s role in his rise, the Leeds boss said his player’s re­nais­sance was down to hard work and a hum­ble ap­proach.</p>
    <p>“Very happy for Pa­trick be­cause he scored some won­der­ful goals. Apart from that a no­ble player who sac­ri­fices a lot for the team. He’s gen­er­ous also,” Bielsa said. “I think his de­vel­op­ment is more to do with him and less to do with me.”</p>
    <p>For Villa, their four-game win­ning run came to a halt as they missed the chance to start a sea­son with five suc­ces­sive vic­to­ries for the first time.</p>
    <p>They es­caped rel­e­ga­tion only on the fi­nal day of last sea­son, so the first de­feat could serve as a re­al­ity check for Dean Smith’s team af­ter their un­ex­pect­edly strong start.</p>
    <p>“Credit to Leeds, their work rate was very good,” the Villa boss said.</p>
    <p>“They got their first goal and that changed the game. We looked dis­ap­pointed and sur­prised.”</p>
