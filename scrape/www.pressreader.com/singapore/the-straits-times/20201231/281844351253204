    <p>The Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front (FPI) was founded on Aug 17, 1998, just a few months after the fall of strong­man Suharto, and sought to en­force strict Is­lamic law. Start­ing as a civil group with al­leged back­ing from the police and mil­i­tary on its anti-vice op­er­a­tions, it has gained pop­u­lar­ity among con­ser­va­tive Mus­lims, claim­ing five mil­lion mem­bers.</p>
    <p>It is led by fire­brand preacher Rizieq Shi­hab, 55, who re­turned to In­done­sia on Nov 10 after more than three years of self-ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia fol­low­ing two police in­ves­ti­ga­tions. He was ar­rested by the police on Dec 12 and is un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for an al­leged breach of coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions in crowd-at­tract­ing events in and out­side Jakarta soon after his re­turn, in­clud­ing his daugh­ter’s wed­ding. He had been em­broiled in a num­ber of past crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, and im­pris­oned at least twice.</p>
    <p>The group is no­to­ri­ous for raid­ing bars, broth­els and other en­ter­tain­ment venues they con­demn as “im­moral places” as well as at­tack­ing re­li­gious mi­nori­ties, in­clud­ing Ah­madiyahs and Chris­tians, with ma­chetes and swords.</p>
    <p>Six of Rizieq’s body­guards were killed on Dec 7 in a high­way shoot-out with police as they ac­com­pa­nied him in a con­voy of ve­hi­cles. Police say those killed were car­ry­ing firearms, in­clud­ing pis­tols, a claim re­jected by the FPI, which de­scribed the shoot­ings as “extra-ju­di­cial killings”.</p>
    <p>The FPI in 2016 or­gan­ised mass street ral­lies against then Jakarta Gov­er­nor Ba­suki Tja­haja Pur­nama for blas­phemy, flex­ing its po­lit­i­cal mus­cle. Rizieq openly sup­ported Mr Prabowo Su­bianto, the only con­tender against Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo in the 2019 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion and who is now De­fence Min­is­ter.</p>
