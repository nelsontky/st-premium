    <p>Be­sides Dick Lee, other home-grown celebri­ties also have had their pho­tos or videos used to con fans.</p>
    <p>DEE­JAY SI­MON LIM (left)</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported last month that the One FM 91.3 dee­jay re­ceived a present and a let­ter from a 31-year-old In­done­sian woman.</p>
    <p>Ms Inayah Muham­mad, who lives in Cen­tral Java, told him she had nearly been duped into trans­fer­ring $5,000 to a man who had ap­proached her on Google Han­gouts us­ing Lim’s pho­tos.</p>
    <p>He told her he was a 50-year-old Sin­ga­porean ma­rine en­gi­neer liv­ing in Bri­tain and that his name was “Si­mon Hyanth Lim”.</p>
    <p>He re­fused to en­gage in video calls with Ms Inayah, but plied her with com­pli­ments and procla­ma­tions of love.</p>
    <p>When he asked for money, she ran some checks and found he had been steal­ing pic­tures from Lim.</p>
    <p>The 52-year-old dee­jay tells ST over the tele­phone he was thank­ful that Ms Inayah did not lose a sin­gle cent.</p>
    <p>He adds: “If you’re chat­ting to some­one on­line and want to ver­ify who he is, ask him to do a video call with you in the place he claims to work. Also, maybe ask him to say some­thing spe­cific like: “‘I’m Si­mon Lim and I want to say hi to Inayah”, so you know he is re­ally in­ter­act­ing with you.</p>
    <p>“If he is un­will­ing to do it, then you could be deal­ing with an im­pos­tor.”</p>
    <p>AC­TOR DES­MOND TAN (left)</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Lianhe Wan­bao re­ported that a Malaysian fan of the Sin­ga­pore ac­tor was conned out of RM60,000 (S$20,000) over eight months.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old mar­ket­ing man­ager liv­ing in Jo­hor, who had been a fan of Tan since his early days, had be­lieved she was ro­manc­ing the 34-year-old ac­tor in se­cret.</p>
    <p>A hacker had re­port­edly gained ac­cess to Tan’s ver­i­fied ac­count on Face­book and used it to reach out to the fan, known only as Kai Li.</p>
    <p>He soon ex­pressed his love for her and she fell for it. Over the course of their cor­re­spon­dence, he cooked up ex­cuses to get money from her.</p>
    <p>When he was even­tu­ally ex­posed, he con­fessed to be­ing Nige­rian and re­turned RM2,000 to Kai Li – which he claimed to be his com­mis­sion for scam­ming her – and apol­o­gised for ly­ing to her. He also told her his feel­ings for her were true.</p>
    <p>Tan, who was un­aware of his fan’s or­deal, told the Chi­nese news­pa­per he would never ask for money from fans.</p>
    <p>AC­TOR ROMEO TAN (left)</p>
    <p>Des­mond Tan’s fel­low Me­di­a­corp ac­tor had his video clip stolen and dubbed with a voice that was not his.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old told Lianhe Zaobao in Au­gust that he re­ceived an on­line mes­sage from a Thai woman, who said a man had been us­ing his pic­tures and videos to at­tempt to con US$1,000 (S$1,338) from her. The scam­mer used the name “Hand­son Gray”.</p>
    <p>She sent the ac­tor a 37-sec­ond clip of him­self, in which his voice had been re­placed by an­other speak­ing in English, say­ing things like “this is me”.</p>
    <p>Tan said the woman, who had been talk­ing to the scam­mer for seven months, did not part with her money.</p>
    <p>“I’m quite numb to re­ports of fake pro­files be­cause there are so many of them. But to do voiceover and edit a video? That’s quite scary,” he added.</p>
