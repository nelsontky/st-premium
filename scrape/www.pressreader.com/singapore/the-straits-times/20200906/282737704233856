    <p>Years from now, if the dust ever set­tles, peo­ple will re­mem­ber how, in 2020, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic af­fected ev­ery in­dus­try, per­me­ated ev­ery psy­che.</p>
    <p>How the food world will evolve in this new nor­mal is now tak­ing shape, as restau­ra­teurs grap­ple with go­ing for­ward af­ter the car­nage wrought by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Les Amis Group, which has 30 es­tab­lish­ments un­der 22 brands in Sin­ga­pore, is us­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence of deal­ing with the coro­n­avirus to man­age its ex­ist­ing restau­rants and to open new ones.</p>
    <p>Be­tween now and early next year, it ex­pects to open nine brick-and­mor­tar restau­rants. The group’s chair­man, Mr Des­mond Lim, tells The Sun­day Times that seven of these had been com­mit­ted to be­fore the pan­demic hit. The other two came from op­por­tu­ni­ties that pre­sented them­selves and are ways to test out new ideas.</p>
    <p>He says can­didly that were it not for govern­ment pro­grammes such as the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS), in which wage sub­si­dies are given to help firms re­tain lo­cal work­ers; and rental re­bates from land­lords, there might not be a plat­form to test out any ideas. So dire was the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“I am thank­ful to the Govern­ment,” Mr Lim says. “The JSS helped us a lot. With­out that, and some of the rental re­bates, we wouldn’t be around today. A 26-year-old busi­ness, and 400 jobs, gone.”</p>
    <p>He adds that the group kept its staff and was able to keep pay cuts small be­cause of govern­ment help.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing to re­turn the pay cut hope­fully by the end of the year,” he says. “The rea­son we are above wa­ter is be­cause of the sup­port from the staff.”</p>
    <p>FRESH FIELDS</p>
    <p>Five of the restau­rants the group had com­mit­ted to open­ing are at Shaw Cen­tre, where its flag­ship restau­rant, the three-Miche­lin­starred Les Amis, is lo­cated. For the most part, the changes in­volve the group’s es­tab­lished brands, and there are two new off­shoots.</p>
    <p>On the sec­ond floor, in the 2,500 sq ft space va­cated by SK-II spa, will be two restau­rants. The flag­ship Tarte by Ch­eryl Koh will move from its cur­rent premises on the same floor to the new space; and there will be an ex­panded La Tape­ria, the group’s Span­ish restau­rant. That big­ger space will also take in La Tape­ria Wine and Tapas.</p>
    <p>Both are ex­pected to open in the sec­ond half of Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Changes are also hap­pen­ing on the third floor of the build­ing. The space now oc­cu­pied by In­digo Blue Kitchen, the group’s Per­anakan restau­rant, will be split in two, to take in a new ca­sual con­cept called Le­mak Boys, by In­digo Blue’s chef Chong Jun Xiang and two mem­bers of his team.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim says it will serve nasi le­mak, laksa le­mak and set meals. Prices will be kept un­der $20 for main cour­ses, and din­ers will have the op­tion of, for ex­am­ple, or­der­ing a stan­dard laksa or nasi le­mak for $12.50, or opt­ing for the pre­mium ver­sion, which will in­clude add-ons such as prawns and sayur lodeh, for $18.50.</p>
    <p>The Per­anakan restau­rant is his pas­sion project, and the dishes on the menu are made from his fam­ily’s recipes.</p>
    <p>“The changes will al­low us to keep the qual­ity high at In­digo Blue,” he says. “We don’t want to sac­ri­fice qual­ity for busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>The two restau­rants are slated to open later this month.</p>
    <p>Also on the third floor, the space oc­cu­pied by the group’s ca­sual Viet­namese restau­rant NamNam will be taken over by a new pizza restau­rant, which will be com­bined with the cur­rent LINO Pasta Bar to be­come LINO Pizza & Pasta Bar. It is also ex­pected to open this month.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim says: “NamNam wasn’t work­ing there; the lo­ca­tion for that restau­rant has to be high-traf­fic.”</p>
    <p>He adds that there are no pizze­rias in the build­ing and that the dough for the new pizza place will be “more doughy but still crisp”, com­pared with the thin and crisp pies of Peper­oni, the group’s pizze­ria chain.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two restau­rants the group com­mit­ted to be­fore the pan­demic will open at Raf­fles City, tak­ing over the space va­cated by COMNAM, an off­shoot of NamNam serv­ing Viet­namese street food.</p>
    <p>A new Tarte out­let will open there, as will a new Ten­jin, which is the group’s ten­don brand, serv­ing tempura over rice. Both are slated to open later this year.</p>
    <p>The op­por­tu­ni­ties to open two other restau­rants came more re­cently.</p>
    <p>At the end of Jan­uary next year, a Peper­oni Pizze­ria will open at United Square. The fam­ily restau­rant, Mr Lim says, suits the lo­ca­tion, with its prox­im­ity to con­do­mini­ums nearby, and the fact that kids – and their fam­i­lies – throng the build­ing for en­rich­ment classes.</p>
    <p>But it is the ninth restau­rant that re­flects the group’s strat­egy of cal­cu­lated risk-tak­ing.</p>
    <p>In early Novem­ber, the group will open SOCIEATY, a multi-con­cept din­ing space that takes over the cof­fee­house of One Far­rer Ho­tel. The space, which can seat 75 to 85 in­doors with safe dis­tanc­ing, will house six of the group’s con­cepts: con­gee chain Mui Kee, Peper­oni Pizze­ria, Ten­jin, In­digo Blue Kitchen, NamNam and Tarte.</p>
    <p>The first two brands will an­chor the space and din­ers will be able to or­der from about 70 per cent of the menu at the stand­alone restau­rants. The other brands will of­fer a smaller se­lec­tion. For ex­am­ple, NamNam will fo­cus on pho.</p>
    <p>Din­ers will be able to or­der from across all six, through a QR code on the ta­bles.</p>
    <p>The lease for SOCIEATY was signed less than two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>For Mr Lim, this is an op­por­tu­nity to see if the idea can be repli­cated. The space the group is tak­ing over will re­quire only mi­nor ren­o­va­tions and the kitchen is al­ready out­fit­ted. Five of the brands, with the ex­cep­tion of Tarte, will share the kitchen space, to be over­seen by Les Amis stal­wart Galvin Lim. Tarte’s of­fer­ings will come from its kitchen in Shaw Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“For us, the risk is lower be­cause we are tak­ing over an ex­ist­ing space,” Mr Des­mond Lim says. “The con­cepts are es­tab­lished.”</p>
    <p>LESSONS LEARNT</p>
    <p>Is­land­wide de­liv­ery, as many other restau­rants have also dis­cov­ered, is here to stay.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple would still rather dine at home,” Mr Lim says. “I’ve told the out­lets not to ne­glect de­liv­ery, de­spite din­ing-in be­ing al­lowed now. They should take the op­por­tu­nity to im­prove – the menus, or­der­ing, modes of pay­ment and the packaging we use. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, we grabbed what­ever eco-friendly packaging we could find on the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“You never know if there might be a sec­ond wave or another lockdown.”</p>
    <p>Also dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, the Les Amis Group found that busi­ness for some of its brands, such as sumiyaki brand Jinjo; LINO, its Ital­ian restau­rant in Bin­jai Park; and Tarte, im­proved.</p>
    <p>“We think this is be­cause Sin­ga­pore­ans were locked in,” Mr Lim says. “On long week­ends usu­ally, busi­ness drops be­cause they go away. But dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, be­cause of the de­liv­ery ser­vice, we reached out to much larger au­di­ences that we would not usu­ally have reached. These are peo­ple liv­ing in the ex­treme ends of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Some of the restau­rants, in­clud­ing Bistro du Vin, La Tape­ria, In­digo Blue and the Ja­panese brands, had to re­tool their menus on the fly, he says, to fo­cus on dishes that travel well. Set meals took away the headache for din­ers want­ing to or­der mul­ti­ple things. So for ex­am­ple, In­digo Blue of­fered meal sets for two, four and eight peo­ple.</p>
    <p>With the central part of Sin­ga­pore much qui­eter be­cause many are still work­ing from home, its NamNam brand has not re­turned to pre-Covid-19 lev­els of busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Of the four out­lets, the one at Whee­lock Place, with res­i­den­tial homes nearby, is do­ing the best. But there is less of this catch­ment for the other out­lets at Raf­fles City, Takashimay­a and Plaza Sin­ga­pura. The group’s restau­rants in sub­ur­ban ar­eas have done bet­ter.</p>
    <p>So new restau­rants will prob­a­bly need to be in the sub­urbs or in inner city ar­eas. Malls are not the only op­tions ei­ther, be­cause as the group has learnt, it can be in­con­ve­nient for a de­liv­ery rider to have to go to the sec­ond or third base­ment floor to pick up food.</p>
    <p>Set lunches have pow­ered many a restau­rant, putting bums on seats.</p>
    <p>But the new thing might well be the set din­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim talks about a re­cent visit to the group’s LINO Ital­ian restau­rant in res­i­den­tial Bin­jai Park. It has been open for close to three years, and busi­ness has picked up.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant, he says, of­fers a three-course set din­ner for $38. Din­ers can pick any three cour­ses from the a la carte menu, with the ex­cep­tion of pizza. The deal is avail­able all week, in­clud­ing pub­lic hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple will look for value,” he says.</p>
    <p>His team is now work­ing on how to fill its restau­rants in the early part of the week be­cause even now, with dine-in al­lowed af­ter a long fal­low pe­riod, de­mand for reser­va­tions is higher to­wards the end of the work week.</p>
    <p>THE FU­TURE’S VIR­TUAL</p>
    <p>The group is not just bet­ting on bricks and mor­tar. If any­thing, the pan­demic has brought for­ward plans to launch “vir­tual” brands with only de­liv­ery and take­aways.</p>
    <p>One of these is Mui Kee Noodles, us­ing the Hong Kong brand, known for its con­gee, to sell Hong Kongstyle beef brisket noodles. Cus­tomers can have it dry or in soup, and other op­tions in­clude curry; and there will be six to eight side dishes. It is ex­pected to launch next year and there are no plans cur­rently for dine-in fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Another brand is Un­cle Wok, which will of­fer six to eight wok hei-filled dishes such as hor fun, Hokkien mee and beef noodles. Find­ing a lo­ca­tion, Mr Lim says, will be the chal­lenge. And there might be benches out­side the kitchen where peo­ple can eat quickly.</p>
    <p>The third idea is a re­vival of an idea it in­tro­duced more than a decade ago – Lazy Gourmet, which of­fered frozen soup, stews and the like.</p>
    <p>“We were ahead of the times,” he says. “But now, there is po­ten­tial to start some­thing sim­i­lar with a wider range of food; pasta, sauces, ren­dang, buah keluak and pho soup. Peo­ple can watch YouTube for tu­to­ri­als.”</p>
    <p>There will be food that peo­ple need only re­heat to make a meal, and foun­da­tions on which they can build a meal. For ex­am­ple, peo­ple who buy laksa gravy or pho soup can add their own noodles, beef and other in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>“The most dif­fi­cult el­e­ment to make is the gravy,” he says.</p>
    <p>SUR­VIVAL OF THE FITTEST</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, who is no­to­ri­ously me­di­ashy, is frank about how the pan­demic has af­fected the group.</p>
    <p>He says of the busi­ness: “The mar­gins are so small. You are lucky to be mak­ing that 5 per cent mar­gin and not los­ing money. Then sales go down 50 to 60 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Never in 26 years have we had to con­tend with any­thing like this. Our losses ev­ery month would have been in ex­cess of seven fig­ures were it not for govern­ment help and rental re­bates.”</p>
    <p>Any cri­sis, he adds, presents threats and op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>He says: “You have to be pre­pared to change and seize the op­por­tu­ni­ties. You can­not be stub­born and keep do­ing things the old way.</p>
    <p>“But you also can’t be­come some­thing that is no longer you. The Les Amis DNA must still be there. Qual­ity comes be­fore ev­ery­thing else.”</p>
