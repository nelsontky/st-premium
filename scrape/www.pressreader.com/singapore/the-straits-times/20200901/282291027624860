    <p>In a week-long blitz, a to­tal of 157 peo­ple were de­tained for var­i­ous crimes, from il­le­gal book­mak­ing to e-com­merce of­fences.</p>
    <p>The multi-agency anti-crime oper­a­tion con­ducted from Aug 23 to 30 led to the ar­rests of some of the 128 men and 29 women picked up. The sus­pects are aged be­tween 16 and 81.</p>
    <p>The oper­a­tion cov­ered var­i­ous lo­ca­tions in Jurong West, Tuas, Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Pan­jang and Bukit Ba­tok, and was led by the Jurong Po­lice Di­vi­sion. It was sup­ported by of­fi­cers from the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bu­reau, Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity and the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to those picked up, 310 peo­ple were also checked by the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force dur­ing the crack­down.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times was present at a po­lice bust on il­le­gal horse-bet­ting tak­ing place at a Jurong West cof­fee shop on Aug 23, at around 2.30pm. Thir­teen men and a woman be­tween the ages of 53 and 72 were de­tained, with po­lice seiz­ing $4,421. The il­le­gal ac­tiv­ity took place in broad day­light and in full view of other cof­fee shop pa­trons and stall­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>At the scene, the po­lice seized bags of ev­i­dence in­clud­ing what looked to be num­bered bet­ting slips, news­pa­pers con­tain­ing de­tails of horse races, and fat stacks of cash.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner of Po­lice Devra­jan Bala, com­man­der of Jurong Po­lice Di­vi­sion, said: “This joint oper­a­tion led by Jurong Po­lice Di­vi­sion is an on­go­ing en­force­ment ef­fort to clamp down on crim­i­nal ac­tiv­i­ties... The po­lice will con­tinue to work closely with other law en­force­ment agen­cies to take tough en­force­ment action against those who are in­volved in crim­i­nal ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties gave a break­down of those de­tained and the of­fences in­volved. In sep­a­rate busts, 21 men and six women aged be­tween 18 and 81 were picked up in con­nec­tion with pub­lic gam­ing, vice-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties, be­ing sus­pected mem­bers of se­cret so­ci­eties, and for traf­fic and ve­hi­cle-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 28 men and a woman aged be­tween 49 and 79 were de­tained for il­le­gal book­mak­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, and are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for of­fences un­der the Bet­ting Act. Cash amount­ing to more than $8,000 and bet­ting-re­lated para­pher­na­lia were seized.</p>
    <p>An­other 53 men and 14 women, aged be­tween 16 and 70, are un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for as­sist­ing in loan­shark­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and loan scams.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the oper­a­tion, 19 men and seven women, aged be­tween 17 and 63, were de­tained for e-com­merce scams and com­mer­cial crime-re­lated of­fences. Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the au­thor­i­ties re­vealed that they were al­legedly in­volved in 39 cases re­ported is­land­wide in­volv­ing more than $592,000.</p>
    <p>Separately, seven men and a woman aged be­tween 24 and 55 were held by the po­lice for sus­pected drug and Cus­toms-re­lated of­fences. The po­lice seized 45 pills, sus­pected to be con­trolled drugs, and 10 car­tons and 24 sticks of as­sorted brands of duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions against all sus­pects are on­go­ing.</p>
