    <p>ORLANDO • The Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son re­sumed yes­ter­day (this morn­ing, Sin­ga­pore time) at the Walt Dis­ney World Re­sort with what could be a sneak peak of this year’s West­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>The lead­ing Lak­ers (49-14) take on the sec­ond-placed Clip­pers (44-20) in the first game be­tween the two Los An­ge­les teams in more than four months.</p>
    <p>A pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus test of Utah Jazz cen­tre Rudy Gobert locked down the league on March 11. Three days be­fore, the Lak­ers beat the Clip­pers 112-103 for their first win in three meet­ings this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The back­drop will no longer be the Sta­ples Cen­tre but the NBA bub­ble in Florida. And there is just an eight-game sprint for seed­ing be­fore the play-offs be­gin.</p>
    <p>Lak­ers coach Frank Vo­gel said: “They’re one of the best teams in the league. More than any­thing, it’s go­ing to be a great mea­sur­ing stick for where we’re at.”</p>
    <p>Lak­ers superstar Le­Bron James said he is ready.</p>
    <p>“I’ll be as locked in as I can be un­der the cir­cum­stances,” said the three-time NBA cham­pion. “I won’t cheat my team­mates, I won’t cheat our fans and I won’t cheat my­self. I’ll be ready to go.”</p>
    <p>An­thony Davis ex­pects to play too. The Lak­ers’ lead­ing scorer, who has av­er­aged 26.7 points per game this term, got poked in his right eye dur­ing Satur­day’s scrim­mage against the Orlando Magic.</p>
    <p>He did not fea­ture in the Lak­ers’ scrim­mage against the Wash­ing­ton Wizards on Mon­day and also sat out prac­tice on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers might go with­out guard Lou Wil­liams, who is a game­time de­ci­sion but is quar­an­tined after be­ing pho­tographed at an At­lanta strip club dur­ing an ex­cused ab­sence. Wil­liams, who leads his team in as­sists with an av­er­age of 5.7 per game, said he vis­ited the es­tab­lish­ment for food.</p>
    <p>“We know that a lot of teams have had their guys through­out. We haven’t,” said Clip­pers coach Doc Rivers. “We’ve had up to five of our key play­ers out – six, at one point... but things don’t go as planned all the time and you’ve got to ad­just, and I think our team is do­ing that.”</p>
    <p>For­ward-cen­tre Mon­trezl Har­rell, who left the fa­cil­ity on July 17 for an emer­gency fam­ily mat­ter, is out. Guard Pa­trick Bev­er­ley, who also left Orlando for a fam­ily mat­ter, re­joined the club last week­end, as did cen­tre Ivica Zubac and guard Landry Shamet, both of whom had tested pos­i­tive re­cently for Covid-19. All three could be avail­able against the Lak­ers.</p>
    <p>Both teams also made ad­di­tions dur­ing the break. Guards Dion Wait­ers and J.R. Smith will re­place Avery Bradley, who opted out due to coro­n­avirus con­cerns, and guard Ra­jon Rondo is re­cov­er­ing from surgery on a bro­ken thumb. The Clip­pers added for­ward-cen­tre Joakim Noah dur­ing the stop­page.</p>
    <p>For Clip­pers star Kawhi Leonard, their up­com­ing games are about build­ing chem­istry. They had their full ros­ter avail­able for only 11 games this sea­son due to in­juries. Leonard and wing­man Paul Ge­orge have played just 32 games to­gether this cam­paign, although they have been stel­lar when they shared the floor, outscor­ing op­po­nents by 11.6 points per 100 pos­ses­sions.</p>
    <p>“I knew that we had a pretty deep squad,” Leonard said. “I knew how ta­lented we could be. It’s about ex­e­cut­ing now.”</p>
