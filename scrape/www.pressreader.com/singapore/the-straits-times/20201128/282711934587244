    <p>• Manch­ester United have con­ducted foren­sic in­ves­ti­ga­tions fol­low­ing a “so­phis­ti­cated” cy­ber at­tack on the Pre­mier League club’s com­puter sys­tems and are work­ing with the Na­tional Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Cen­tre (NCSC) to as­sess the dam­age.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils said they had ex­pe­ri­enced a cy­ber at­tack last week and had shut down af­fected sys­tems to pro­tect data, though the club’s me­dia chan­nels, in­clud­ing their web­site and mo­bile app, were un­af­fected.</p>
    <p>“The NCSC is aware of an in­ci­dent af­fect­ing Manch­ester United Foot­ball Club and we are work­ing with the or­gan­i­sa­tion and part­ners to un­der­stand im­pact,” a spokesman for the se­cu­rity agency told the Bri­tish me­dia.</p>
    <p>United added the at­tack had not im­pacted match-day oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“Fol­low­ing the re­cent cy­ber at­tack on the club, our IT team and ex­ter­nal ex­perts se­cured our net­works and have con­ducted foren­sic in­ves­ti­ga­tions,” the club said in a state­ment. “This at­tack was by na­ture dis­rup­tive, but we are not aware of any fan data be­ing com­pro­mised. Crit­i­cal sys­tems re­quired for matches at Old Traf­ford re­mained se­cure and games have gone ahead as nor­mal.”</p>
    <p>United, who will travel to Southamp­ton for their l eague game at St Mary’s to­mor­row, also said they would not com­ment on those re­spon­si­ble for the at­tack and re­fused to con­firm me­dia re­ports they re­ceived ransom de­mands from hack­ers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Daily Mail, hack­ers are de­mand­ing “mil­lions of dol­lars”, with United’s net­work re­port­edly in­fected by ran­somware. The BBC added that staff still have no ac­cess to their email, and other func­tions re­main un­avail­able.</p>
    <p>It is not known who the crim­i­nals are. While United as­sured their fans that there has been no data pro­tec­tion breach, the club could face fines of £9 mil­lion (S$16 mil­lion), £18 mil­lion or two per cent of their to­tal an­nual turnover from the in­de­pen­dent gov­ern­ment body, In­for­ma­tion Com­mis­sioner’s Of­fice, if there is a leak.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Manch­ester City’s in­ter­nal e-mails were hacked, lead­ing to a Uefa in­ves­ti­ga­tion into fi­nan­cial fair play vi­o­la­tions that re­sulted in a two-year Cham­pi­ons League ban that was over­turned in July.</p>
    <p>Warn­ing that sports clubs are vul­ner­a­ble to hack­ers, the NCSC told the Mail: “The business im­pact of ran­somware at­tacks can be dis­as­trous. Since 2018, ran­somware at­tacks have been grow­ing in im­pact. The crim­i­nals car­ry­ing out the at­tacks are tak­ing more time to an­a­lyse vic­tim net­works and un­der­stand the ‘value’ of the tar­get or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
