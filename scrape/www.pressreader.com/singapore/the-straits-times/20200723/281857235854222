    <p>SEOUL • Cracks may be emerg­ing in the so-called iron-clad mil­i­tary al­liance be­tween South Korea and the United States, stok­ing wor­ries in Seoul that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is look­ing at with­draw­ing troops from the penin­sula.</p>
    <p>US De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper is not rul­ing out re­duc­tions to US Forces Korea, telling a fo­rum on Tues­day that while no or­der has been given, the ad­min­is­tra­tion was look­ing to ad­just its pos­ture glob­ally.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to a July 17 re­port in The Wall Street Jour­nal say­ing the Pen­tagon had given US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump options to draw down troops amid a dead­lock over the US’ de­mands for more fund­ing.</p>
    <p>While Mr Trump has com­plained about ope­nended US mil­i­tary com­mit­ments since be­fore tak­ing of­fice, the threat of a with­drawal has in­creased since his de­ci­sion last month to re­duce the coun­try’s mil­i­tary foot­print in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in’s gov­ern­ment has said lit­tle about a troop cut if the two sides can­not re­new their ex­pired Spe­cial Mea­sures Agree­ment (SMA), but some worry the dis­cus­sion could sig­nal weak­ness to neigh­bour­ing North Korea and China.</p>
    <p>“The al­liance is a mat­ter of sur­vival to South Korea,” said re­tired South Korean ma­jor-gen­eral Kim Joong-ro. “Of course, Wash­ing­ton’s SMA de­mands are over­whelm­ing, but this shouldn’t hurt the al­liance it­self. There is no such thing called a ‘sec­ond chance’ in se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has asked South Korea to con­trib­ute about US$5 bil­lion (S$6.9 bil­lion) for host­ing some 28,500 US mil­i­tary per­son­nel, well above the cur­rent one-year deal where Seoul pays about US$1 bil­lion. The price tag orig­i­nated with the White House, sources said, and has been a non-starter in South Korea, with both the pro­gres­sive rul­ing bloc and the con­ser­va­tive op­po­si­tion see­ing it as ex­or­bi­tant.</p>
    <p>The rum­blings come as North Korea said it sees no point in hav­ing nu­clear ne­go­ti­a­tions now with Wash­ing­ton and raised ten­sions with its neigh­bour South Korea by blow­ing up a joint li­ai­son of­fice lo­cated just north of their bor­der last month.</p>
    <p>The seven-decades-old mil­i­tary al­liance be­tween the US and South Korea was dealt a blow in April when the Amer­i­can mil­i­tary put al­most half of its 8,500 South Korean civil­ian work­ers on fur­lough after the two sides could not reach a new fi­nanc­ing deal after months of ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“Amer­ica needs its troops in South Korea to check China’s grow­ing global clout, but if the cost is too high, that strat­egy may change in any time,” said Mr Park Hwee-rhak, a former South Korean army colonel who is now a pro­fes­sor of pol­i­tics at Kook­min Univer­sity in Seoul. “We must note that the al­liance is a mat­ter of sur­vival to South Korea, but is one of the many strategic choices to the US.”</p>
