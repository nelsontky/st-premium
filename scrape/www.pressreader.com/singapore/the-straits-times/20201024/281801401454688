    <p>A World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion ex­pert said this week that Europe and North Amer­ica should fol­low the ex­am­ple of Asian states by per­se­ver­ing with an­tivirus mea­sures and quar­an­tin­ing any­one who comes into con­tact with those in­fected.</p>
    <p>Europe takes des­per­ate mea­sures to cur­tail seem­ingly un­stop­pable wave of in­fec­tions</p>
    <p>PARIS • Ger­many warned of the coun­try’s “very se­ri­ous sit­u­a­tion” and France cau­tioned that “the com­ing weeks will be hard”, as the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ues to spread un­re­strained across Europe.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases in the re­gion have more than dou­bled in 10 days, cross­ing 200,000 daily in­fec­tions for the first time on Thurs­day, with coun­tries like Italy, Aus­tria, Croa­tia, Slove­nia and Bos­nia re­port­ing their high­est sin­gle-day in­creases.</p>
    <p>Europe had recorded 100,000 daily cases for the first time only on Oct 12. It has so far re­ported about 7.8 mil­lion Covid-19 cases and 247,000 deaths in to­tal.</p>
    <p>As a re­gion, Europe is see­ing more daily cases than In­dia, Brazil and the United States com­bined.</p>
    <p>It now ac­counts for nearly 19 per cent of global cases and about 22 per cent of global deaths.</p>
    <p>“The health sit­u­a­tion of our coun­try con­tin­ues to de­te­ri­o­rate,” France’s Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said on Thurs­day, as he widened a coro­n­avirus cur­few to more than two thirds of its pop­u­la­tion. “The com­ing weeks will be hard and our hos­pi­tals will be sorely tested.”</p>
    <p>France is re­port­ing Europe’s high­est seven-day av­er­age of new cases, with 25,480 in­fec­tions a day. It recorded an all-time high of 41,622 new con­firmed cases on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Paris and eight other French cities came un­der a 9pm to 6am cur­few last week­end. The new rules were ex­tended to 38 more de­part­ments and French Poly­ne­sia for six weeks from mid­night yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of con­firmed cases per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants has risen by 40 per cent in a week to 251 per 100,000, Mr Cas­tex said.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter warned that if France does “not suc­ceed col­lec­tively in halt­ing the epi­demic, we will be faced with a dra­matic sit­u­a­tion and will have to en­vis­age much tougher mea­sures”.</p>
    <p>He re­fused to say if this meant that the whole coun­try could be put un­der a se­cond lockdown in the run-up to the Christ­mas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The cur­few in Paris, Lyon, Mar­seille and other big cities has forced bars, restau­rants and the­atres that had al­ready suf­fered huge losses dur­ing an ear­lier two-month lockdown to close early, leav­ing many fight­ing for sur­vival.</p>
    <p>French Cul­ture Min­is­ter Rose­lyne Bach­e­lot on Thurs­day an­nounced an €85 mil­lion (S$137 mil­lion) aid pack­age for the­atres, con­cert halls and other live en­ter­tain­ment venues, along with a fur­ther €30 mil­lion for cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one needs cul­ture, maybe even more so dur­ing this cri­sis, which has af­fected our abil­ity to gather to­gether,” she said.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many – which re­ported more than 10,000 daily cases for the first time on Thurs­day – the au­thor­i­ties ex­tended travel warn­ings for Switzer­land, Ire­land, Poland, and most of the Aus­trian and Ital­ian re­gions, in­clud­ing Rome.</p>
    <p>While Ger­many’s in­fec­tion rates are lower than in much of Europe, they have also been ac­cel­er­at­ing.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion has be­come very se­ri­ous over­all,” said Pro­fes­sor Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch In­sti­tute for in­fec­tious diseases, adding that the coun­try must pre­pare for an un­con­trolled spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>“We still have a chance to slow the spread of the pan­demic”, but peo­ple must stick to the rules, Prof Wieler said.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s new travel warn­ings cover places such as pop­u­lar ski re­gions in Aus­tria, Italy and Switzer­land. Bri­tain, ex­cept the Chan­nel Is­lands, the Isle of Man and the over­seas ter­ri­to­ries, is also seen as a high-risk area.</p>
    <p>Un­der the warn­ings, which take ef­fect from to­day, trav­ellers re­turn­ing to Ger­many must quar­an­tine for 10 days. Quar­an­tine can be lifted early, if a test taken af­ter five days comes back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s move could sig­nif­i­cantly im­pact the Alpine coun­tries’ ski sea­son. Aus­tria, which re­ported a record 2,435 new daily in­fec­tions on Thurs­day, is a pop­u­lar des­ti­na­tion for Ger­mans.</p>
    <p>Over in the Nether­lands, the health au­thor­i­ties also re­ported a new daily record of more than 9,000 in­fec­tions on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>A World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) ex­pert said this week that Europe and North Amer­ica should fol­low the ex­am­ple of Asian states by per­se­ver­ing with an­tivirus mea­sures and quar­an­tin­ing any­one who comes into con­tact with those in­fected.</p>
    <p>“The coun­tries in Asia, South Asia, the Western Pa­cific that have been suc­cess­ful... have re­ally con­tin­ued to fol­low through on those key ac­tiv­i­ties,” WHO ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Mike Ryan said.</p>
