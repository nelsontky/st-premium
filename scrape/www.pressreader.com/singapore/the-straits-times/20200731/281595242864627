    <p>Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh has clar­i­fied that he will set aside half the pay in­crease he will get as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion for do­na­tions to his party, res­i­dents and char­i­ties. He said that after in­come tax de­duc­tions, the amount he will give away works out to less than $96,000.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh has clar­i­fied that he will set aside half the pay in­crease he will get as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion (LO) for do­na­tions to his party, res­i­dents and char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Clear­ing the air on how much of his salary he plans to do­nate, Mr Singh said that after in­come tax de­duc­tions, the amount he will give away is half the in­crease in his salary, which works out to less than $96,000 of his $385,000 an­nual pay, he said on Face­book on Wednes­day.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, after the Govern­ment gave de­tails about his po­lit­i­cal ap­point­ment, in­clud­ing salary, Mr Singh put up a Face­book post say­ing he would use a per­cent­age of his salary “for a greater pur­pose”.</p>
    <p>In the post, he said he would “al­lo­cate 50 per cent of the LO salary, after taxes” to­wards fund­ing pro­grammes for res­i­dents, his party’s spe­cific needs, and char­i­ta­ble causes.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh’s post sparked wide­spread in­ter­est, as well as a de­bate about whether he in­tends to do­nate half his en­tire salary or if he plans to do­nate half the pay in­crease he will be get­ting as LO.</p>
    <p>On Wednes­day, Mr Singh added a clar­i­fi­ca­tion to his orig­i­nal post.</p>
    <p>He said: “For clar­ity, 50 per cent of the ad­di­tional LO salary amount­ing to about $96,000 per an­num is ded­i­cated to the above pur­poses. The ac­tual amount will be less after in­come tax de­duc­tion. It is im­por­tant I make this clear.”</p>
    <p>The sum of $385,000 is dou­ble the amount reg­u­lar MPs get, and Mr Singh’s de­ci­sion to give away half of the pay rise drew praise from many ob­servers, who said he was set­ting a good ex­am­ple for other po­lit­i­cal leaders.</p>
    <p>In his orig­i­nal post, Mr Singh said he had dis­cussed the of­fer of the LO po­si­tion with his wife Loveleen Kaur Walia, after they put their two daugh­ters to bed.</p>
    <p>He said: “While I am grate­ful to re­ceive the ad­di­tional sup­port and re­mu­ner­a­tion that comes with the ti­tle of Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, the ap­point­ment will re­quire more in­vest­ment of my time and longer hours away from my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“Amongst other things, we spoke about what the salary in­crease would mean for our fam­ily. Both of us felt strongly that a per­cent­age of the salary should be used for a greater pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>His Face­book post re­ceived more than 4,000 com­ments, mostly from ne­ti­zens who ex­pressed their re­spect for him.</p>
    <p>But some peo­ple ques­tioned his mo­tives for mak­ing the plan pub­lic.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, for­mer Nom­i­nated MP Calvin Cheng called it “po­lit­i­cal the­atre”, and his post on Face­book sparked dis­cus­sion on how much Mr Singh would be giv­ing away.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien</p>
    <p>Loong’s wife Ho Ching, who shared sev­eral of Mr Cheng’s posts on the is­sue, also put up a post on Face­book about the do­nat­ing of money, say­ing: “There are lots of folks who do­nated and con­tinue to do­nate qui­etly, with­out mak­ing any pub­lic an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>“Some folks make pub­lic an­nounce­ment of part of their do­na­tions, and still main­tain pri­vacy on the rest of their reg­u­lar do­na­tions.”</p>
    <p>She did not re­fer to Mr Singh or cite spe­cific ex­am­ples in her post.</p>
    <p>Last night, Progress Sin­ga­pore Party chief Tan Cheng Bock, in a Face­book post, sup­ported Mr Singh’s de­ci­sion, say­ing it is a “won­der­ful and gen­er­ous ges­ture and sets a good ex­am­ple for Sin­ga­pore­ans to em­u­late”.</p>
    <p>He added: “It is sad and un­be­com­ing, that some peo­ple have cho­sen in­stead, to cast as­per­sions on his in­ten­tions... It is far bet­ter to be gra­cious and wel­come the ges­ture than to con­tinue to try to score po­lit­i­cal points. This is very dis­ap­point­ing.”</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Loke Hoe Yeong – the au­thor of a re­cent book on the his­tory of the op­po­si­tion in Sin­ga­pore called The First Wave – also waded into the dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, he said he was “baf­fled at the hue and cry from some quar­ters” about Mr Singh’s de­ci­sion. Dr Loke said that in 1985, then Min­is­ter of State Wong Kan Seng said he would do­nate half his min­is­te­rial salary and MP al­lowance, and he chal­lenged op­po­si­tion leaders J.B. Je­yaret­nam and Chiam See Tong to do the same with their MP al­lowance and salary from their le­gal prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong was re­spond­ing to a call from Mr Je­yaret­nam to cut min­is­te­rial salaries by 25 per cent amid a re­ces­sion that year, Dr Loke added.</p>
    <p>Over the years, more than a few MPs and min­is­ters have given away sub­stan­tial amounts of their al­lowances and pay.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, for in­stance, do­nated in­creases in his salary for sev­eral years from 2007, say­ing he wanted to sig­nal to Sin­ga­pore­ans that his “pri­mary con­sid­er­a­tions are for the fu­ture of this na­tion, and not for my own salary”. He has also do­nated money to fund a raft of awards, such as the Prime Min­is­ter’s So­cial Ser­vice Award, to en­cour­age more Sin­ga­pore­ans to choose ca­reers in so­cial ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong has used his en­tire MP al­lowance since be­ing elected in 2011 to fund grassroots din­ners and char­i­ta­ble do­na­tions, among other things.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, such as MacPher­son MP Tin Pei Ling, spend most of their MP al­lowance on do­na­tions and grassroots ac­tiv­i­ties, and set­ting up so­cial projects in their con­stituen­cies.</p>
