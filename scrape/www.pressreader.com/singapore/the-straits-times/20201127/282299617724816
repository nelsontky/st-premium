    <p>Thai­land’s ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing mar­ket has chalked up an­other stel­lar per­for­mance, beat­ing Sin­ga­pore for the sec­ond year run­ning as the top IPO mar­ket in South­east Asia by value of funds raised, ac­cord­ing to re­search from pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm Deloitte.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore had eight list­ings that raised a to­tal of US$852 mil­lion (S$1.14 bil­lion) in the first 101/</p>
    <p>2 months of this year.</p>
    <p>This was dwarfed by the US$3.9 bil­lion raised from 23 IPOs in Thai­land in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Last year’s com­pe­ti­tion was keener, with Thai­land rais­ing US$3 bil­lion from 34 list­ings, com­pared with the US$2.26 bil­lion from 11 list­ings in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Thai­land, South-east Asia’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy, also out­did the com­bined per­for­mance of the re­gion’s largest econ­omy In­done­sia, Sin­ga­pore and the three other coun­tries in Deloitte’s re­search – Malaysia, the Philip­pines and Viet­nam. They raised a to­tal of US$2.54 bil­lion this year.</p>
    <p>Dis­rup­tive events ad­vi­sory leader at Deloitte Thai­land Wi­lasi­nee Kr­ish­namra said: “Largely driven by home-grown com­pa­nies and fu­elled by in­creas­ing in­vestor in­ter­ests in firms fo­cused on con­sumer busi­nesses, (Thai­land’s IPO mar­ket) con­tin­ues to ap­peal strongly to in­vestors and fund man­agers.”</p>
    <p>It is not all doom and gloom for Sin­ga­pore’s IPO scene de­spite its weaker per­for­mance this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay Hwee Ling, dis­rup­tive events ad­vi­sory leader at Deloitte South-east Asia and Sin­ga­pore, said the pan­demic has cre­ated new op­por­tu­ni­ties for the IPO mar­ket in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Amid the economic un­cer­tainty, qual­ity com­pa­nies with a larger cus­tomer base will think of rais­ing funds through IPOs to fur­ther grow their busi­ness, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay said a key ex­am­ple is nan­otech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions provider Nanofilm Tech­nolo­gies In­ter­na­tional. It raised US$345 mil­lion on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s (SGX) main board, where real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts have made up most new list­ings in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay said more com­pa­nies could list in the com­ing weeks or early next year, in­clud­ing firms in sec­tors which have been boosted by the pan­demic, such as health­care and e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>“When they are boom­ing, it is un­avoid­able that they will need to raise funds to ex­pand their ca­pac­ity,” she told a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She noted that Hong Kong-based fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion AMTD In­ter­na­tional in April be­came the first com­pany to be dual-listed on the New York Stock Ex­change and SGX.</p>
    <p>This could bode well for other global firms that want to have a dual list­ing in Sin­ga­pore, to en­joy ex­tended trad­ing hours and tap Sin­ga­pore as a gate­way to the South­east Asian mar­ket, said Ms Tay.</p>
    <p>By list­ing in Sin­ga­pore, they can also ac­cess dif­fer­ent types of in­vestors here and in Asia-Pa­cific, such as high net worth in­vestors who en­gage fam­ily of­fices here to man­age their wealth.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay added that due to pan­demic-in­duced travel re­stric­tions, there has also been a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in trad­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, which could en­cour­age com­pa­nies to list to meet the higher de­mand.</p>
    <p>Two firms have ex­pressed their in­ter­est to list this month, ac­cord­ing to Deloitte’s re­search – Credit Bureau Asia, a credit and risk in­for­ma­tion so­lu­tions provider, and Aedge Group, which of­fers en­gi­neer­ing, trans­port, as well as se­cu­rity and man­power ser­vices.</p>
