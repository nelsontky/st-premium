    <p>TAIPEI • On a cloudy day last month, thou­sands of sol­diers massed on a beach in cen­tral Tai­wan for the cul­mi­na­tion of five days of ex­er­cises in­tended to demon­strate how the is­land’s mil­i­tary would re­pel an in­va­sion from China.</p>
    <p>Jets, he­li­copters and ar­tillery and mis­sile bat­ter­ies fired live am­mu­ni­tion at tar­gets off­shore, send­ing plumes of sea spray into the air. Then, a few hours later, a mil­i­tary he­li­copter tak­ing part in the same ex­er­cise crashed at an air­field far­ther up the coast, killing two pi­lots and cast­ing a shadow over the show of force.</p>
    <p>It was the lat­est in a string of deadly mishaps, in­clud­ing a crash in Jan­uary that killed the mil­i­tary’s top com­man­der, which have given new ur­gency to the de­bate over Tai­wan’s readi­ness to de­fend its 24 mil­lion peo­ple – with or with­out the help of the United States.</p>
    <p>“I have to be hon­est: Tai­wan’s mil­i­tary needs to im­prove a lot,” Mr Wang Ting-yu, a mem­ber of the Parliament’s for­eign af­fairs and de­fence com­mit­tee, said in a tele­phone in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s lead­ers have been mov­ing to shake up the mil­i­tary and in­crease spend­ing. Mil­i­tary ten­sions across the Tai­wan Strait have surged in re­cent months as Tai­wan has in­creas­ingly be­come a fo­cal point in the con­fronta­tion be­tween China and the United States.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army of China held a fresh round of live-fire ex­er­cises – an un­usu­ally con­cen­trated train­ing sched­ule that the state news me­dia said was di­rected at Tai­wan and the US.</p>
    <p>The lat­est in­volved a test fir­ing of four medium-range bal­lis­tic mis­siles into an area of the South China Sea near Hainan last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The bar­rage came a day af­ter China ac­cused the Amer­i­cans of fly­ing a spy plane over one of the ex­er­cises, call­ing it a “naked provo­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>China has long threat­ened to use force, if needed, to pre­vent any move­ment to­wards for­mal in­de­pen­dence for Tai­wan, a self-gov­ern­ing democ­racy.</p>
    <p>China has stepped up those warn­ings ever since Tai­wan’s Pres­i­dent, Ms Tsai Ing-wen, won re-elec­tion in Jan­uary by vow­ing to pro­tect the is­land’s sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>That has raised fears that Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping could feel com­pelled to act ag­gres­sively, as China has in ar­eas from the South China Sea to the border with In­dia.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese air­craft and war­ships have re­peat­edly men­aced Tai­wan’s airspace and ter­ri­to­rial waters in re­cent months, while of­fi­cials have taunted its mil­i­tary, com­par­ing it to “an ant try­ing to shake a tree”.</p>
    <p>“The like­li­hood of a mil­i­tary clash is much higher than be­fore,” said Mr Lin Yu-fang, a Tai­wanese former leg­is­la­tor from the Kuom­intang, the op­po­si­tion party that ruled the is­land for decades.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai has re­sponded to China’s mus­cle flex­ing by press­ing ahead with mil­i­tary changes. She has moved to re­vamp Tai­wan’s mil­i­tary doc­trine and strengthen its re­serves, a force that would be cru­cial to de­fend­ing the is­land in the event of an in­va­sion.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai’s govern­ment an­nounced this month that it would in­crease Tai­wan’s de­fence budget by 10 per cent, on top of a 5 per cent in­crease the year be­fore. That would raise mil­i­tary spend­ing to more than 2 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan also fi­nalised a deal an­nounced last year to buy 66 Amer­i­can F-16 fighter jets, worth US$62 bil­lion (S$84.2 bil­lion), over the next 10 years.</p>
    <p>By law, the US is com­mit­ted to pro­vid­ing Tai­wan with the sup­port nec­es­sary to de­fend it­self, a point re­it­er­ated by US Sec­re­tary of De­fence Mark Esper in a re­cent talk. Yet it is far from clear whether the US would risk a broader con­fronta­tion with a nu­clear-armed China, mean­ing Tai­wan can­not count on it as a mat­ter of strat­egy.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai’s pre­de­ces­sor Ma Ying­jeou has ac­cused her of cling­ing to hopes that as long as Tai­wan puts up an ini­tial de­fence, the US would in­ter­vene on the is­land’s be­half, a sce­nario he con­sid­ered im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma did not elab­o­rate, but Ms Tsai said in an in­ter­view last year that Tai­wan would be able to hold out for 24 hours and then China would face in­ter­na­tional pres­sure.</p>
    <p>For decades, Tai­wan’s se­cu­rity was as­sured by the is­land’s mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties, but China’s ef­forts to mod­ernise its forces have up­ended the bal­ance of power.</p>
    <p>China now has “an ar­ray of op­tions for a Tai­wan cam­paign, rang­ing from an air and mar­itime block­ade to a full-scale am­phibi­ous in­va­sion”, ac­cord­ing to a 2019 Pen­tagon re­port on the Chi­nese mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>The re­port ac­knowl­edged the chal­lenges the Chi­nese army would face in such an at­tack, but said China’s build-up “has eroded or negated” many of Tai­wan’s ad­van­tages. Those in­clude the is­land’s ge­og­ra­phy and the tech­ni­cal su­pe­ri­or­ity it once had from buy­ing Amer­i­can and other for­eign weaponry.</p>
