    <p>PARIS • More than 3.5 mil­lion birds across Europe, in­clud­ing the ducks used for France’s famed foie gras, have died from avian flu since Oc­to­ber in the most far­reach­ing out­break on the con­ti­nent in four years.</p>
    <p>New cases of highly con­ta­gious strains of H5N8 and H5N1 have been found in at least a dozen coun­tries, ac­cord­ing to data from the World Or­gan­i­sa­tion for An­i­mal Health.</p>
    <p>The ca­su­al­ties in­clude hun­dreds of thou­sands of ducks in France as well as tur­keys, chicken and egglay­ing hens in Poland, the Euro­pean Union’s top poul­try pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>The flu – of­ten spread by mi­grat­ing birds – is found most win­ters, but this sea­son’s re­ports be­gan ear­lier than nor­mal and likely will con­tinue un­til March.</p>
    <p>“It is re­ally a high-pres­sure sea­son,” said Mr Nan-Dirk Mul­der, se­nior global an­i­mal-pro­tein strate­gist at Rabobank in Utrecht, the Nether­lands. “I’m afraid we’re still go­ing to see cases for the next two months.”</p>
    <p>The out­break has spurred poul­try im­port re­stric­tions by na­tions in­clud­ing China and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Over two mil­lion birds have died in Poland, while Ger­many has re­ported al­most 30 out­breaks. Turkey farms were hit in Hun­gary and Bri­tain, and Den­mark sus­pended sales of chick­ens out­side the EU.</p>
    <p>The EU is the world’s third­largest chicken ship­per and any lost sales may ben­e­fit its ri­vals, the United States and Brazil.</p>
    <p>France – the world’s big­gest foie gras pro­ducer – has found more than 120 out­breaks in the south­west, where most birds are raised to pro­duce the lux­ury food.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­ers say 600,000 ducks have been culled since last month and hun­dreds of thou­sands more are ex­pected to be killed.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Asian coun­tries are also grap­pling with the virus, with South Korea culling nearly six mil­lion birds and In­dia re­port­ing cases in four states.</p>
