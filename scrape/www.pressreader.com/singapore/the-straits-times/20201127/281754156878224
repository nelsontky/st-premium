    <p>Bangladesh­i au­thor­i­ties are try­ing to gather more in­for­ma­tion about Ahmed Faysal, the 26-year-old con­struc­tion worker who was ar­rested un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act in Sin­ga­pore ear­lier this month for his al­leged in­volve­ment in ter­ror­ism-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial from the Counter Ter­ror­ism and Transna­tional Crime (CTTC) unit of the Dhaka Met­ro­pol­i­tan Po­lice told The Straits Times over the phone that a man named Faysal had cropped up in their in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­cently.</p>
    <p>“We had no idea he was liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore. All we knew is that he was some­one liv­ing abroad and had been in on­line con­tact with some of our sus­pects,” said Mr Sai­ful Is­lam, a deputy com­mis­sioner with the CTTC unit. At­tempts are now be­ing made to source more de­tails on Faysal so that the au­thor­i­ties can as­cer­tain whether the two in­di­vid­u­als are one and the same.</p>
    <p>Mr Is­lam added that he had not re­ceived any in­for­ma­tion about Faysal’s ar­rest prior to the me­dia re­ports and that he also knew noth­ing about the 15 other Bangladesh­i na­tion­als who were de­ported from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Faysal’s rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion jour­ney, which be­gan in 2018 in Sin­ga­pore af­ter he was ex­posed to pro-Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) ma­te­ri­als on­line, has high­lighted the con­tin­u­ing chal­lenge for the au­thor­i­ties across the globe try­ing to crack down on on­line ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>Mr Shafqat Mu­nir, head of the Bangladesh Cen­tre for Ter­ror­ism Re­search in Dhaka, told ST it is crit­i­cal to map out the en­tire process that led to Faysal’s rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion, in­clud­ing what his mo­ti­va­tions may have been to carry out at­tacks.</p>
    <p>“Whether his rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion is closely re­lated to what hap­pened in France or does it go back even fur­ther – these are the things au­thor­i­ties in Bangladesh and Sin­ga­pore need to work closely on,” he said.</p>
    <p>There has been no ma­jor ter­ror­ist at­tack in Bangladesh since July 2016. The at­tack on the Ho­ley Artisan Bak­ery, which left 22 in­di­vid­u­als dead, was claimed by ISIS but Bangladesh blamed it on Ja­maat-ulMu­jahideen Bangladesh, a home­grown out­lawed Is­lamist group.</p>
    <p>All the five gun­men in­volved in the at­tack were killed by po­lice and seven other in­di­vid­u­als, who were found guilty of plan­ning the as­sault and sup­ply­ing weapons, were sen­tenced to death last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment led by Prime Min­is­ter Sheikh Hasina has re­peat­edly em­pha­sised its “zero tol­er­ance ap­proach to ter­ror­ism and vi­o­lent ex­trem­ism”. Since 2016, se­cu­rity forces have suc­cess­fully cracked down on lo­cal ter­ror­ist net­works but, as Mr Mu­nir pointed out, the ab­sence of ter­ror­ist at­tacks in the coun­try “does not trans­late into the ab­sence of a threat of ter­ror­ism”.</p>
    <p>“While Bangladesh has made re­mark­able progress in curb­ing ter­ror­ism, there is a need for more long-term strate­gic mea­sures to fur­ther limit that threat,” he said.</p>
    <p>Fiercely proud of its syn­cretic tra­di­tions, Bangladesh has, in re­cent years, seen a grow­ing tide of re­li­gious con­ser­vatism.</p>
    <p>Around 40,000 peo­ple protested in the cap­i­tal, Dhaka, last month fol­low­ing the re-pub­li­ca­tion of Prophet Muham­mad’s car­i­ca­tures and France’s tough stance on rad­i­cal Is­lam.</p>
