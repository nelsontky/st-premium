    <p>Lo­cal eq­ui­ties inched up yes­ter­day as in­vestors clung to hopes that a fis­cal stim­u­lus pack­age will land ahead of next month’s United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The White House has said it will agree to a US$1.9 tril­lion (S$2.57 tril­lion) deal but that is still US$300 bil­lion short of what Democrats have put for­ward.</p>
    <p>Ax­iCorp chief mar­ket strate­gist Stephen Innes said in­vestors are now “suf­fer­ing a se­vere case of stim­u­lus talk ex­haus­tion”, with more peo­ple now opt­ing for the side­lines.</p>
    <p>But he ex­pects mar­kets to trend in a more volatile man­ner in the lead-up to the highly an­tic­i­pated “ma­jor macro event of the year”.</p>
    <p>“Stock mar­ket in­vestors have enough cash to put to work, and things will bounce back in a big way de­spite this week’s teenage crush with a pre-elec­tion stim­u­lus hurt­ing the view,” Mr Innes added.</p>
    <p>The air of op­ti­mism nudged the Straits Times In­dex up 0.1 per cent, or 2.8 points, to 2,528.41, with losers out­num­ber­ing gain­ers 211 to 202 on trade of 1.34 bil­lion shares worth $1.01 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ven­ture Corp was the big­gest loser of the day after hit­ting a 52-week high of $21.21 on Wed­nes­day morn­ing. RHB had up­graded the stock to a “buy”, cit­ing an im­proved out­look.</p>
    <p>The counter ended the day at $20.55, down 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>City De­vel­op­ments ex­tended its slide yes­ter­day, shed­ding 1.1 per cent to $7, with 10.5 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands. In­vestors con­tin­ued to take flight fol­low­ing the res­ig­na­tion of non-ex­ec­u­tive and non-in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor Kwek Leng</p>
    <p>Peck; some 10.5 mil­lion shares changed hands.</p>
    <p>Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings and Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings were again among the win­ners, both ris­ing about 1.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Among the con­stituent stocks, Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional and Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries came out tops, each gain­ing 1.4 per cent over the course of the day. Wil­mar closed at $4.30 and Sem­b­corp at $1.43.</p>
    <p>The trio of len­ders ended the day in the black. DBS Bank gained 0.9 per cent to $21.44, United Over­seas Bank added 0.3 per cent to $19.98 and OCBC Bank closed at $8.76, up 0.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Stocks on Wall Street re­treated amid elec­tion and stim­u­lus un­cer­tain­ties. The Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age fell 0.4 per cent, the S&P 500 lost 0.2 per cent and the Nas­daq shed 0.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Asian mar­kets were mixed. Malaysian stocks rose 0.4 per cent and the Hang Seng gained 0.1 per cent, but the Nikkei fell 0.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Australian shares re­cov­ered strongly from a sharp 1.5 per cent de­cline early in the ses­sion to fin­ish down just 0.3 per cent.</p>
