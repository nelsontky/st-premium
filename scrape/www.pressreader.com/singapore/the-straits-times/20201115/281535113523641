    <p>With so many dif­fer­ent types of face masks now read­ily avail­able in neigh­bour­hood shops and heart­land malls alike, the ques­tion be­comes: How ef­fec­tive are they against Covid-19 and other res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions?</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times se­lected nine types of sur­gi­cal and re­us­able masks and put them through two tests.</p>
    <p>PARTICLE FIL­TRA­TION EF­FI­CIENCY (PFE) TEST</p>
    <p>Work­ing with lab ex­perts from lo­cal test­ing and in­spec­tion com­pany Setsco Ser­vices, a particle fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency (PFE) test was con­ducted to mea­sure how well the masks pre­vent tiny res­pi­ra­tory droplets – at 0.1 mi­cron or one mil­lionth of a me­tre – from es­cap­ing.</p>
    <p>A good mask should have a PFE rate of at least 95 per cent.</p>
    <p>BREATHA­BIL­ITY TEST</p>
    <p>A breatha­bil­ity test was also con­ducted to mea­sure how com­fort­able it is to breathe through the masks.</p>
    <p>This writer tested the breatha­bil­ity of the six re­us­able masks, while the breatha­bil­ity of the three sur­gi­cal masks, which are non-re­us­able, was as­cer­tained through a dif­fer­en­tial pres­sure test.</p>
    <p>In the lat­ter group, the masks were sub­jected to air pres­sure to de­ter­mine their re­sis­tance. Gen­er­ally, the lower the re­sis­tance the bet­ter the breatha­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>A dif­fer­en­tial pres­sure read­ing of less than 40 pas­cals per sq cm in­di­cates that the mask is com­fort­able for the wearer.</p>
    <p>To de­ter­mine whether face masks com­ply with stan­dards set by ASTM, an in­ter­na­tional stan­dards or­gan­i­sa­tion, a to­tal of five tests have to be con­ducted.</p>
    <p>They in­clude tests for bac­te­rial fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency (BFE), fluid re­sis­tance and flamma­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The lat­est DET mask given out by Te­masek, which is not among the nine masks tested, has a dif­fer­en­tial pres­sure read­ing equiv­a­lent to less than 40 pas­cals per sq cm, but does not have a PFE read­ing. Its BFE, how­ever, is at more than 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>Out of the nine masks tested, the sur­gi­cal masks did well on both tests, whereas the re­us­able masks re­flected a trade-off be­tween breatha­bil­ity and fil­tra­tion effi</p>
    <p>Ideally, the best re­us­able mask should have three lay­ers, with a non-wo­ven fab­ric as the mid­dle layer to bet­ter ab­sorb the wa­ter par­ti­cles. That way, the in­ner and outer lay­ers can be made of por­ous ma­te­ri­als for bet­ter breatha­bil­ity, while not com­pro­mis­ing on fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency, just like sur­gi­cal masks.</p>
    <p>ciency, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The sur­gi­cal masks had a PFE range of more than 98 per cent, while most re­us­able masks had a PFE range of zero per cent to 20 per cent, with the ex­cep­tion of sam­ple four, which had a PFE of 88.51 per cent.</p>
    <p>This means that most of the re­us­able masks were not very ef­fi­cient at fil­ter­ing 0.1 mi­cron par­ti­cles, but they may fil­ter par­ti­cles that are larger in size.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the re­sults, Dr Joel Lee, di­rec­tor of the School of Chem­i­cal and Life Sciences at Nanyang Polytech­nic, said it was “not sur­pris­ing” that re­us­able masks had a lower PFE rate com­pared with sur­gi­cal masks.</p>
    <p>But he noted that sam­ple four com­prised three lay­ers and had a high-per­for­mance fil­ter that kept it dry from ex­ter­nal mois­ture.</p>
    <p>It also had a first layer of breath­able mesh, which en­abled it to bal­ance breatha­bil­ity with good PFE, he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Teo Tee Hui, coun­cil mem­ber at The In­sti­tute of Engi­neers Sin­ga­pore and a se­nior lec­turer at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign, also noted that the mask had such a high PFE be­cause it was mainly made out of finely wo­ven ny­lon.</p>
    <p>The other re­us­able masks that were tested used coarse cot­ton for both in­ner and outer lay­ers.</p>
    <p>“Coarse cot­ton is good for breatha­bil­ity but it is por­ous. Res­pi­ra­tory droplets are not well-ab­sorbed, ex­plain­ing the low fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency,” he said.</p>
    <p>Most re­us­able masks are dou­ble-lay­ered, with ei­ther both lay­ers made of cot­ton or just the in­ner layer made of cot­ton and the outer one from polyester, he added.</p>
    <p>Polyester is a good ma­te­rial to use on the outer layer of the mask as it is wa­ter-re­sis­tant and can re­pel droplets from en­ter­ing. But if the in­ner layer is made of coarse cot­ton, it could ham­per the mask’s over­all fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>“Ideally, the best re­us­able mask should have three lay­ers, with a non-wo­ven fab­ric as the mid­dle layer to bet­ter ab­sorb the wa­ter par­ti­cles. That way, the in­ner and outer lay­ers can be made of por­ous ma­te­ri­als for bet­ter breatha­bil­ity, while not com­pro­mis­ing on fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency, just like sur­gi­cal masks,” Dr Teo said.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee also sug­gested that masks be of two lay­ers or more, and made out of a com­bi­na­tion of ma­te­ri­als, such as chif­fon weave or flan­nel, for bet­ter fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Out of the six re­us­able masks tested by the writer, sam­ple five, a sin­gle-lay­ered mask, likely made out of polyester or polyuretha­ne (a type of plas­tic ma­te­rial) or a blend of both ma­te­ri­als, was the most com­fort­able, though its PFE was at zero per cent.</p>
    <p>Dr Teo noted that polyuretha­ne, fre­quently used i n lin­gerie, is known for its stretch­i­ness and com­fort, but like polyester, it may not be as ef­fec­tive in trap­ping droplets.</p>
    <p>It could, how­ever, still pre­vent droplets larger in size from be­ing re­leased into the en­vi­ron­ment, though it is rec­om­mended to choose a mask with bet­ter PFE.</p>
    <p>Both ex­perts agreed that a good ap­proach would be to wear sur­gi­cal masks in high-risk and crowded places, such as hos­pi­tals, and to use re­us­able masks for lowrisk ac­tiv­i­ties. Wear­ing a mask should also be done in con­junc­tion with other mea­sures, such as safe dis­tanc­ing, to en­sure one’s safety and hy­giene, they added.</p>
