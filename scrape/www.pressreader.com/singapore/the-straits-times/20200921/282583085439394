    <p>HIT TWICE BY APPENDICIT­IS: Daniel Wu (right) was hos­pi­talised for appendicit­is in March last year. Last Thurs­day, the Hong Kong-Amer­i­can ac­tor was back in hos­pi­tal again be­cause of the same prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Wu, 45, posted on In­sta­gram: “In March of 2019, I had appendicit­is that I thought was food poi­son­ing, so I waited three days be­fore go­ing to the hos­pi­tal.” He said he was put on a course of an­tibi­otics with no food for 10 days af­ter sep­sis set in and doc­tors could not get the ap­pendix out.</p>
    <p>He lost 8kg and took sev­eral months to re­cover. The ac­tor of hit movies, in­clud­ing Over­heard (2009) and Tomb Raider (2018), said doc­tors left his ap­pendix in­tact.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, the con­di­tion struck again last Thurs­day. He went to hos­pi­tal where doc­tors re­moved his ap­pendix the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>Wu is cur­rently at home con­va­lesc­ing. He is mar­ried to su­per­model Lisa Se­lesner and the cou­ple have a seven-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>He wrote in his post: “What are the chances of hav­ing two appendicit­is? I think I should buy a lottery ticket today.”</p>
