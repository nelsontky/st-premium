    <p>The way the English lan­guage is taught in schools here has evolved over the years.</p>
    <p>Nar­ra­tive writ­ing is one chal­leng­ing area for many pri­mary school pupils. In the con­tin­u­ous writ­ing sec­tion of the English exam, pupils are given a topic and three pic­tures, and are ex­pected to cre­ate a co­her­ent plot with be­liev­able char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Although writ­ing a nar­ra­tive from dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives is en­cour­aged, more of­ten than not, pupils pre­fer to stick to the safer route of writ­ing a story from the first-per­son point of view since they lack con­fi­dence and train­ing.</p>
    <p>Nowa­days, chil­dren are more ex­posed to a wide ar­ray of car­toons and fan­tasy movies that in­vari­ably stray from re­al­ity. Pri­mary school chil­dren are en­thu­si­as­tic about spin­ning tales that re­volve around enchanted crea­tures in a mag­i­cal world or life in outer space.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, a gen­eral con­sen­sus pre­vails that nar­ra­tive writ­ing should be steeped in logic from start to fin­ish in or­der to judge one’s pro­fi­ciency in writ­ing. Some pupils find this quite re­stric­tive and stress­ful. It sti­fles their cre­ativ­ity and damp­ens their spir­its be­cause they strug­gle to weave a seam­less log­i­cal story.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that writ­ing a fan­tasy story re­quires as much skill as any other piece of writ­ing, since the fun­da­men­tal el­e­ments of writ­ing re­main the same. Also, the kind of cre­ativ­ity that is in­voked in such writ­ing is ex­cep­tional.</p>
    <p>Pupils must be given the op­por­tu­nity to em­brace their pre­ferred genre of writ­ing. Schools should also teach pupils how to write in less con­ven­tional gen­res.</p>
    <p>This way, there is more joy in writ­ing for all, which is the real ob­jec­tive of the ex­er­cise.</p>
