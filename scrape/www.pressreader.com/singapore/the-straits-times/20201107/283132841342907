    <p>For­get a car which can drive it­self. Here’s one which is psy­chic.</p>
    <p>The 2020 Audi A8 limou­sine knows what lies ahead and ad­justs its sus­pen­sion to iron out bumps or counter cor­ner­ing forces.</p>
    <p>Audi calls it pre­dic­tive ac­tive sus­pen­sion. A cam­era sys­tem reads the ter­rain ahead, feeds the in­for­ma­tion to ac­tu­a­tors which op­ti­mise sus­pen­sion set­tings on each wheel – this paves the way for a satiny smooth progress.</p>
    <p>Does it work as ad­ver­tised? At the Audi Brand Ex­pe­ri­ence here two years ago, an on-site demo with a show car proved it re­duced body move­ments dra­mat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>In the real world, the smart sus­pen­sion seems quicker than other adap­tive sys­tems which re­act to sur­face vari­a­tions only when the car en­coun­ters them.</p>
    <p>It works best around cor­ners. Take the 3-litre A8 (with nor­mal wheel­base of close to 3m) around a sharp bend at 40kmh and the car traces an arc with an al­most flat chas­sis. You will still feel the cor­ner­ing force, but there is very lit­tle body roll.</p>
    <p>As with all things, there is of course a limit – cor­ner too fast and you will still up­set the car (and its oc­cu­pants). Ac­cord­ing to Audi, any­thing up to 1g of lat­eral ac­cel­er­a­tion will only re­sult in a 2-de­gree roll – ver­sus more than 5 de­grees with a nor­mal air sus­pen­sion. In short, no spilt cof­fee.</p>
    <p>Tar­mac im­per­fec­tions are not com­pletely re­solved, even if the sys­tem is sup­pos­edly able to vary ride height at each wheel by up to 85mm within half a sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Nasty road ruts still sur­prise the rear wheels – oc­ca­sion­ally with dis­con­cert­ing noises.</p>
    <p>Well-paved stretches are han­dled as well as any limo with air springs.</p>
    <p>Be­sides a cam­era sys­tem, the car’s pre­dic­tive sus­pen­sion re­lies on the car’s sat-nav map too. So, in a way, its eyes and mem­ory help to set the sus­pen­sion up to cope with con­tour changes be­fore the wheels come into con­tact with them.</p>
    <p>The A8 comes with an­other com­fort fea­ture. When the door han­dle is pulled, the body rises to make get­ting in and out eas­ier.</p>
    <p>Audi is not the first to have these fea­tures. Mercedes-Benz has had pre­dic­tive sus­pen­sion in its S-class since 2013. And Lexus has had height-ad­just­ing easy ac­cess in its LS sedan since 2017.</p>
    <p>But Audi is the first to have both fea­tures in an all-wheel-drive, which adds to the A8’s dy­namism at higher speeds and in the wet.</p>
    <p>The flag­ship has long been a tech­nol­ogy show­case since its de­but 26 years ago. Think alu­minium frame, all-wheel-drive, air sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>This fourth-gen­er­a­tion car, be­sides hav­ing pre­dic­tive sus­pen­sion, has Level 3 au­tonomous driv­ing ca­pa­bil­ity – just that leg­is­la­tion does not al­low it to be used here. Level 3 means the car can con­voy in slow traf­fic, op­er­at­ing its steer­ing, ac­cel­er­a­tion and brak­ing all on its own – as long as lane mark­ings are clear.</p>
    <p>Al­though Level 3 driv­ing is dis­abled, the A8 has lane-keep­ing abil­ity, which in­ter­venes if the car de­parts from its lane with­out you sig­nalling. In the test car, the steer­ing in­ter­ven­tion is abrupt, force­ful, and often, over­done. You can switch it off if you don’t like it.</p>
    <p>TRANS­MIS­SION Eight-speed Tip­tronic with pad­dle shift POWER 340hp at 5,000rpm TORQUE 500Nm at 1,370-4,500rpm</p>
    <p>5.6 sec­onds 250kmh</p>
    <p>Other smart fea­tures are nicer, though. Such as its soft-touch door han­dle ac­tu­a­tors, which are man­i­cure-friendly and which will pause if the car senses a ve­hi­cle ap­proach­ing on your side.</p>
    <p>Not so nice is the car’s 15 litre/100km con­sump­tion, which is al­most dou­ble its claimed fig­ure. Fret not – the car will lead you to the near­est pump.</p>
