    <p>When it comes to fight­ing against the Covid-19 pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore has been punch­ing above its weight.</p>
    <p>Blood sam­ples from three pa­tients here were used to de­velop the ex­per­i­men­tal an­ti­body cock­tail used to treat United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump af­ter he tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) had re­sponded to a col­lab­o­ra­tion re­quest from US biotech­nol­ogy firm Re­gen­eron – the com­pany which de­vel­oped that an­ti­body cock­tail – with no claim of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty right over the treat­ment.</p>
    <p>NCID was re­quested to re­cruit up to 20 re­cov­ered pa­tients for con­tri­bu­tion of sam­ples.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ob­tain­ing ethics ap­proval and pa­tients’ in­formed con­sent, NCID re­cruited five pa­tients and was in­formed by Re­gen­eron that they had – at that point – suf­fi­cient sam­ples to de­velop the an­ti­body cock­tails, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor David Lye, senior con­sul­tant and di­rec­tor of the In­fec­tious Dis­ease Re­search and Train­ing Of­fice at NCID, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­gen­eron even­tu­ally used three of the five Sin­ga­pore pa­tient sam­ples as the re­search start­ing point to de­velop the an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Re­gen­eron’s treat­ment, called REGN-COV2, is a com­bi­na­tion, or</p>
    <p>“cock­tail”, of two an­ti­bod­ies which are in­fec­tion-fight­ing pro­teins that were de­vel­oped to bind them­selves to the virus and in­hibit it from in­vad­ing hu­man cells.</p>
    <p>A cock­tail would make it more dif­fi­cult for the virus to mu­tate and es­cape the an­ti­bod­ies as more of them are tar­get­ing dif­fer­ent sites of the virus.</p>
    <p>In a pa­per pub­lished in Sci­ence Mag­a­zine in June, Re­gen­eron sci­en­tists de­scribed how they se­lected the two best an­ti­bod­ies from both re­cov­ered hu­man pa­tients and in­fected mice that were ge­net­i­cally mod­i­fied to give them hu­man-like im­mune sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has re­leased some promis­ing early data re­gard­ing its Covid-19 ther­apy, but no de­tails that would prove the ef­fi­cacy of the treat­ment have been made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the col­lab­o­ra­tion with Re­gen­eron, Sin­ga­pore is also part of a global phase three mon­o­clonal an­ti­body trial, named Ac­tiv-3, which started in Au­gust and aims to re­cruit 1,000 pa­tients glob­ally.</p>
    <p>As at Thurs­day, 260 pa­tients had been re­cruited in the global trial, most of them from Den­mark and the US. Sin­ga­pore is only the third coun­try to start re­cruit­ing pa­tients for it.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv-3 is es­ti­mated to be com­pleted by the year end or in Jan­uary, so Sin­ga­pore’s con­tri­bu­tion will de­pend on how long it takes for the trial to re­cruit the study num­ber and how many pa­tients are el­i­gi­ble for the trial here.</p>
    <p>The mon­o­clonal an­ti­body was de­vel­oped by Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Eli Lilly. It is a pu­ri­fied, highly ac­tive an­ti­body that tar­gets the spike protein of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
