    <p>As a stu­dent at the now de­funct Parry Sec­ondary School in Yishun, Sean Mah had a habit of of­ten look­ing out of the win­dow.</p>
    <p>It earned him the ire of a teacher who, on more than one oc­ca­sion, told him with­er­ingly: “No one’s go­ing to pay you to look out the win­dow, you know.”</p>
    <p>Well, he did end up mak­ing a liv­ing look­ing out of win­dows – and get­ting paid pretty hand­somely for it too.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Mah, you see, is a demon­stra­tion and main­te­nance test pilot with Amer­i­can aerospace man­u­fac­turer Bell. Hav­ing clocked more than 7,000 fly­ing hours over 15 years, the 55-year-old is prob­a­bly also Sin­ga­pore’s most ex­pe­ri­enced he­li­copter pilot.</p>
    <p>Prior to join­ing Bell – where his job in­volves fly­ing all over the globe to show­case or de­liver the com­pany’s he­li­copters to clients – last July, he worked for avi­a­tion com­pa­nies in New Zealand and Malaysia, and was the per­sonal pilot of a tex­tile ty­coon in China.</p>
    <p>Among other ex­ploits, he has fer­ried ad­ven­ture-seek­ing tourists to far-flung lo­ca­tions in New Zealand’s South Is­land, trained pi­lots from the Royal Thai Po­lice, worked with sol­diers from the Malaysian Spe­cial Forces to en­force wildlife pro­tec­tion in the coun­try’s jun­gles and na­tional parks, and shown off his fly­ing skills in two Chi­nese movies: com­edy Pe­ga­sus (2019) and ac­tion thriller Op­er­a­tion Mekong (2016).</p>
    <p>A man who has wanted to fly for as long as he can re­mem­ber, he is liv­ing his dream, one which, if not for his bull-headed per­sis­tence and de­ter­mi­na­tion, would have re­mained un­re­alised be­cause of the odds and his cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>A well-spo­ken and ami­able man, he is the el­der of two chil­dren of a print­ing firm ma­chine op­er­a­tor and a house­wife.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he was born, the fam­ily moved to Pe­tal­ing Jaya, in Se­lan­gor, where Mr Mah spent a care­free child­hood. They re­turned to Sin­ga­pore when he was eight. Home was a three-room flat in Toa Payoh Lorong 2.</p>
    <p>“It was chal­leng­ing. I missed my free­dom and friends. Every­thing was dif­fer­ent, even the air was dif­fer­ent. I was not a happy camper,” he says with a grin.</p>
    <p>Ac­tive and ath­letic, he wanted to take up swim­ming but his mother for­bade him for fear he might drown. “I’m the only son. She said: ‘You’ve got to be alive to feed me’,” he jokes.</p>
    <p>But he would sneak off to Toa Payoh Swim­ming Com­plex where he met and per­suaded a swim­ming en­thu­si­ast called Si­mon to teach him how to swim. “He was ac­tu­ally a sur­veyor. The first stroke he taught me was the but­ter­fly,” Mr Mah re­calls.</p>
    <p>As with all things en­gi­neered by serendip­ity, that episode was a mas­ter­stroke, set­ting off a chain of events and en­coun­ters which would change his life.</p>
    <p>Out of the blue one day when he was 15, his teacher Mrs Matthew “ar­rowed” him to take part in a swim­ming com­pe­ti­tion. The dark horse won ef­fort­lessly.</p>
    <p>At Toa Payoh Swim­ming Com­plex, he chanced upon the na­tional wa­ter polo team train­ing, in­vei­gled a try­out and was part of the team for about seven years un­til his early 20s.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence fu­elled his wan­der­lust: he got to travel to dif­fer­ent cities in­clud­ing Bu­dapest and Fukuoka to take part in matches and com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­cause hit­ting the books was not quite his cup of tea, he left school with just three O lev­els – English, Sci­ence and Geog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>He at­tributes his flu­ent English to an Aus­tralian cou­ple he and his fa­ther be­friended while fish­ing off a wooden jetty in Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>The late Terry Dart Neil had just landed a lec­tur­ing job in Sin­ga­pore and wanted to make some lo­cal friends. Mr Mah ended up spend­ing a lot of time in the cou­ple’s home.</p>
    <p>“He took me scuba div­ing. They also cor­rected me when I spoke. That’s why some peo­ple some­times tell me to take the potato out of my mouth. But I can switch lah,” he says.</p>
    <p>Although he har­boured dreams of fly­ing a he­li­copter – “I used to see them of­ten from the win­dow of our flat in Toa Payoh” – his re­sults put paid to such am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>He wasn’t too wor­ried about his fu­ture then. “I was very fo­cused on my wa­ter polo train­ing,” says Mr Mah, who landed a job as a life­guard at Be­dok Swim­ming Com­plex in­stead.</p>
    <p>There, Fate ar­ranged for him to meet Mr Jimmy Choo, who was a for­mer Royal Malaysian Air Force he­li­copter pilot and in­struc­tor be­fore be­com­ing a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines pilot.</p>
    <p>“He’d come to the pool every day and we started talk­ing. He needed help with his front crawl, I needed help with my ca­reer,” Mr Mah says, ad­ding that they are still good friends.</p>
    <p>In­stead of pour­ing cold wa­ter on his fly­ing dreams, Mr Choo would en­cour­age him, telling him the dif­fer­ent op­tions avail­able if he wanted to get his fly­ing li­cence.</p>
    <p>The odds against him, how­ever, were stag­ger­ing, es­pe­cially the time and the money re­quired for such an un­der­tak­ing.</p>
    <p>“And there’s no as­sur­ance that you’d get a job with a pilot’s li­cence. Ba­si­cally that’s only good enough to not kill your­self. You need the ex­pe­ri­ence to back it up,” he says.</p>
    <p>He shelved the dream, quit his life­guard job, left the wa­ter polo team and found a job do­ing sales for a diesel en­gine firm. Be­cause he was per­son­able, he did well and was soon head­hunted for a man­age­rial po­si­tion at an oil stor­age com­pany.</p>
    <p>A back­pack­ing trip to the Tas­man District in New Zealand’s South Is­land, how­ever, reignited his fly­ing dream. Then in his early 20s, he splurged on a he­li­copter ride to get to a re­mote river brim­ming with “big fish”.</p>
    <p>“We landed at this spot right in front of a cabin where the river was,” he says, ad­ding that the few hun­dred dol­lars he shelled out for the chop­per ride in­cluded a week’s stay at the cabin. “I re­ally love the out­doors so I told my­self: ‘I want to do this, I re­ally want to do this.’”</p>
    <p>So for the next few years, he beavered away and saved what­ever he could. Every op­por­tu­nity he got, he would high­tail it to New Zealand to take fly­ing lessons.</p>
    <p>On the ad­vice of Mr Choo, he started with learn­ing how to fly planes in­stead of he­li­copters be­cause chop­per lessons were a lot more ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>“Jimmy also told me: ‘Go and do your fixed wing first so that you un­der­stand the rules, how to fly a plane and nav­i­ga­tion’. And New Zealand is a tough place to fly be­cause of the wind and the ter­rain.”</p>
    <p>The process was tough, he says. “Every time I went back, I would have to play catch-up,” says Mr Mah, who took nearly 100 hours of plane lessons be­fore mov­ing on to he­li­copter train­ing, which took an­other 100 hours.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, his pro­fes­sional life took a cou­ple of in­ter­est­ing turns.</p>
    <p>Af­ter do­ing sales for a num­ber of years, he and a part­ner set up a com­pany deal­ing in con­struc­tion equip­ment in the late 1990s.</p>
    <p>The com­pany did well in the first six years, with Mr Mah help­ing to ex­pand op­er­a­tions to Aus­tralia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>In fact, his in­come en­abled him to get he­li­copter fly­ing lessons from a fly­ing school ITNS – now de­funct – to sup­ple­ment the ones he was get­ting in New Zealand.</p>
    <p>He got his he­li­copter pri­vate pilot li­cence from Malaysia in</p>
    <p>2003 and his com­mer­cial pilot li­cence from New Zealand two years later. To­day, Mr Mah also has com­mer­cial pilot li­cences from the United States and Canada.</p>
    <p>While run­ning his busi­ness in New Zealand, he signed up to be­come a pilot with Alpine He­li­copters, which op­er­ates scenic flights and pri­vate as well as com­mer­cial char­ters.</p>
    <p>This was in the mid-2000s and the coun­try was see­ing an in­flux of Chi­nese tourists thirsty for ad­ven­ture and new ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Be­cause he speaks the lan­guage, he cre­ated a mar­ket for this seg­ment, or­gan­is­ing week-long tours which in­volved ac­tiv­i­ties like div­ing for cray­fish and heli-skiing.</p>
    <p>“So can you imag­ine the money com­ing in? It was much bet­ter than sell­ing con­struc­tion equip­ment, which failed,” he says.</p>
    <p>Can­didly, he lets on that his com­pany folded af­ter 13 years in 2012, wip­ing him out fi­nan­cially.</p>
    <p>He came back to Sin­ga­pore with­out a job.</p>
    <p>“I had ac­quired thou­sands of hours fly­ing in the moun­tains and in dif­fer­ent con­di­tions. I was ex­pe­ri­enced in fly­ing many types of he­li­copters but there was no fly­ing job in Sin­ga­pore,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>Within two months, how­ever, a call came from the boss of Malaysian avi­a­tion com­pany Sys­tem­atic Avi­a­tion Ser­vices. “He had three brand new he­li­copters sit­ting there and he said: ‘Sean, these three he­li­copters are yours; can you go and make some money for me?’”</p>
    <p>So Mr Mah hit on the idea of of­fer­ing char­ters and scenic rides – just like what he did in New Zealand – from Pu­lau Langkawi, which boasts many five-star ho­tels in­clud­ing Four Sea­sons, St Regis and the Westin.</p>
    <p>“Langkawi has 99 is­lands. I know every sin­gle beach. We of­fered dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ences: Land­ing on a beach on one of the is­lands and set­ting up a bar­be­cue, fly­ing to the Na­tional Park to look at ele­phants or to Pe­nang for a good char kway teow.</p>
    <p>“I flew quite a lot of heads of state,” he says.</p>
    <p>There were also brushes with celebrity. In 2015, he was en­gaged to fly chop­pers for the film­ing of Op­er­a­tion Mekong, a thriller di­rected by Dante Lam and shot in Cameron High­lands.</p>
    <p>“Ed­die Peng is a re­ally nice guy and very in­ter­ested in avi­a­tion,” he says of the Tai­wanese lead ac­tor well-known for his roles in ac­tion movies in­clud­ing Call Of He­roes and Tales Of Wukong.</p>
    <p>Mr Mah’s most mem­o­rable as­sign­ment, how­ever, was help­ing to de­liver hu­man­i­tar­ian aid and re­lief dur­ing the mas­sive floods in Malaysia in 2014 when a few hun­dred thou­sand peo­ple were dis­placed.</p>
    <p>A cou­ple of years later in 2016, he was of­fered a job work­ing for a 40-some­thing tex­tile ty­coon in China who owned five he­li­copters, in­clud­ing two man­u­fac­tured by Bell.</p>
    <p>“He didn’t speak any English and he wanted some­one who could fly his he­li­copters and also con­verse with him in Man­darin,” says Mr Mah.</p>
    <p>For the first six months, his boss put him up in a ju­nior suite on the top floor of the Sof­i­tel in Bei­jing, be­fore mov­ing him to an apart­ment. He was also given a Tesla and a driver.</p>
    <p>As his per­sonal pilot, Mr Mah also taught his boss how to fly his chop­pers.</p>
    <p>Although he was paid and treated well, he left af­ter a year when an op­por­tu­nity came to train the Royal Thai Po­lice in fly­ing the 429, a twin-en­gine he­li­copter de­vel­oped by Bell and Korea Aerospace In­dus­tries and of­ten de­ployed by law en­force­ment units all over the world.</p>
    <p>The di­vorcee, who has an 18-year-old daugh­ter, did this for one year be­fore join­ing Bell last year.</p>
    <p>“To fly for the OEM (orig­i­nal equip­ment man­u­fac­turer) has al­ways been my child­hood dream,” says Mr Mah, whose job in­volves test­ing, fly­ing and de­liv­er­ing the com­pany’s air­craft.</p>
    <p>“I go wher­ever they send me,” says the pilot, who is now in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Fly­ing is won­der­ful, but con­nect­ing with peo­ple he meets in the course of his work is no less so, he says.</p>
    <p>He has a treasure trove of tales about the folks with whom he crossed paths: the woman who begged him to help find her brother’s body af­ter a boat­ing in­ci­dent in Langkawi, and the ikan ku­rau towkay who took a joyride in his chop­per af­ter bad weather forced Mr Mah to land in a field in Kuala Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>Asked what comes into his mind when he looks back on his life, he says: “Well, life is full of chal­lenges. I’ve learnt over the years to never give up. It’s like fly­ing dur­ing the Malaysian floods... you just have to find a way.</p>
    <p>“I con­tinue to face the chal­lenges and move from one fail­ure to an­other with en­thu­si­asm. And I be­lieve life will be a lot bet­ter if we al­ways try and lift each other up.”</p>
