    <p>KEY ROLE IN GLOBAL RE­SPONSE</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial sys­tem plays a key role in catalysing this global re­sponse (to cli­mate change). Fi­nan­cial mar­kets are piv­otal in the al­lo­ca­tion of cap­i­tal and re­sources through­out the wider econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has re­duced the earn­ings of many com­pa­nies and the in­comes of nu­mer­ous house­holds, dom­i­nates daily news.</p>
    <p>Yet, there is an­other long-term event that con­tin­ues to present sig­nif­i­cant risk to fi­nan­cial sys­tems and their cus­tomers, and that is cli­mate change, said the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) in its an­nual Fi­nan­cial Sta­bil­ity Re­view re­leased last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>To ad­dress this, reg­u­la­tors and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions need to as­sess how cli­mate change will im­pact them, the au­thor­ity added, not­ing that there is grow­ing recog­ni­tion of the risk re­lated to such sus­tain­abil­ity-re­lated is­sues.</p>
    <p>“Cli­mate change has be­come the defin­ing chal­lenge fac­ing both present and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. From shift­ing weather pat­terns to ris­ing sea lev­els, the risks posed by cli­mate change are both mul­ti­fac­eted and per­va­sive in their man­i­fes­ta­tion,” MAS said.</p>
    <p>“The fi­nan­cial sys­tem plays a key role in catalysing this global re­sponse. Fi­nan­cial mar­kets are piv­otal in the al­lo­ca­tion of cap­i­tal and re­sources through­out the wider econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>MAS added that the fi­nan­cial sys­tem will be vi­tal in en­abling economies to make a suc­cess­ful tran­si­tion to a more sus­tain­able tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>THE MON­E­TARY AU­THOR­ITY OF SIN­GA­PORE, on tran­si­tion­ing to a more sus­tain­able econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions are ex­posed to cli­mate risks be­cause they pro­vide fi­nanc­ing and in­surance ser­vices to en­ti­ties which could be sig­nif­i­cantly im­pacted,” it added.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate change lead­ing to en­vi­ron­men­tal crises can pose phys­i­cal risk to com­pa­nies. Peo­ple and firms can face costs and losses when ex­posed to such dis­as­ters, MAS said.</p>
    <p>Th­ese crises can range from flash floods to longer-term changes in cli­mate pat­terns, such as the grad­ual melt­ing of po­lar ice sheets and de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion, where once-fer­tile ar­eas be­come arid and in dan­ger of los­ing wa­ter, veg­e­ta­tion and wildlife.</p>
    <p>But cli­mate is­sues can also have wider macro-eco­nomic ef­fects, MAS said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a coun­try whose key in­fra­struc­ture is de­stroyed by the cri­sis can also see its stocks be­ing im­pacted and pro­duc­tiv­ity hin­dered if work­ers are im­peded from per­form­ing their tasks.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, cli­mate change</p>
    <p>poses tran­si­tion risk to com­pa­nies, ac­cord­ing to the au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>This refers to how the switch to a low-emis­sions econ­omy can cre­ate eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and in­cur fi­nan­cial costs for firms as they try to ad­just to new poli­cies, in­vestor pref­er­ences and so­cial norms.</p>
    <p>Firms that have a greater de­pen­dence on car­bon-in­ten­sive as­sets can be more badly hit, MAS said.</p>
    <p>“Con­versely, firms with more en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly pro­cesses might stand to ben­e­fit.”</p>
    <p>Th­ese cli­mate-re­lated risks can have im­pli­ca­tions on fi­nan­cial sys­tems, MAS added.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a bor­rower will be less able to re­pay debt if he is af­fected by cli­mate crises. De­val­u­a­tion of a bor­rower’s as­sets can also lead to higher credit risk for banks.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket prices can also take a hit, the re­port said, es­pe­cially for firms re­lated to car­bon-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries and com­modi­ties.</p>
    <p>New green tech­nol­ogy can even­tu­ally ren­der some busi­nesses ob­so­lete, with shifts in con­sumer pref­er­ences, MAS said.</p>
    <p>In­vestors have to keep a keen eye on th­ese changes as well, as greener in­dus­tries might see in­creases in mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese changes in fi­nan­cial val­u­a­tions pose mar­ket risk to in­vestors, de­pend­ing on their trad­ing and in­vest­ment po­si­tions,” MAS said.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ers are also not spared, as they could face large un­der­writ­ing losses if there are sus­tained or cu­mu­la­tive claims re­lated to cli­mate dis­as­ters.</p>
    <p>MAS noted that it has al­ready started to in­cor­po­rate cli­mate risk sce­nar­ios as part of an an­nual in­dus­try­wide stress test.</p>
    <p>In the 2018 test, in­sur­ers were sub­jected to a sce­nario fea­tur­ing ex­treme flood­ing and had to con­sider the im­pact of higher claims on their bal­ance sheets.</p>
    <p>Within the next two years, MAS will also in­cor­po­rate a broader range of cli­mate risks in the­matic sce­nar­ios as part of the test, it said.</p>
    <p>It added: “Many of th­ese risks are com­plex, and as­sess­ing them will re­quire the nec­es­sary data, ex­per­tise and mod­els. It is thus im­per­a­tive for the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try to build up th­ese re­sources in a timely man­ner, in or­der to bet­ter as­sess, man­age and mit­i­gate them.”</p>
