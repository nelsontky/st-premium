    <p>PARIS Men in­fected with Covid-19 are three times more likely to re­quire in­ten­sive care hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion than women and are at sig­nif­i­cantly higher risk of dy­ing from the virus, sci­en­tists said.</p>
    <p>Researcher­s an­a­lysed more than three mil­lion con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases from 46 coun­tries and 44 states in the US be­tween Jan 1 and June 1.</p>
    <p>They found that the risk of Sars</p>
    <p>Cov-2 in­fec­tion was the same for women and men, as “ex­actly half” of the con­firmed cases were male pa­tients.</p>
    <p>But the men are al­most three times more likely than the women to be hos­pi­talised in an in­ten­sive care unit and are 39 per cent more likely to die from the virus, the study said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The data “may help doc­tors to recog­nise that sex is a risk fac­tor for se­vere dis­ease when man­ag­ing pa­tients”, Dr Kate Webb, co-au­thor of the study, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“Sex is an un­der-re­ported vari­able in many stud­ies and this is a re­minder that it is an im­por­tant fac­tor to con­sider in re­search,” the Cape Town Univer­sity re­searcher added.</p>
    <p>The trend is global – aside from a few ex­cep­tions – and can mostly be put down to bi­o­log­i­cal dif­fer­ences, researcher­s said.</p>
    <p>“Sex dif­fer­ences in both the in­nate and adap­tive im­mune sys­tem have been pre­vi­ously re­ported and may ac­count for the fe­male ad­van­tage in Covid-19,” the au­thors said.</p>
    <p>Women nat­u­rally pro­duce more type I in­ter­feron pro­teins that limit the ab­nor­mal im­mune re­sponse known as a cy­tokine storm, be­lieved to play a role in pro­vok­ing se­vere forms of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The “fe­male” oestra­diol hor­mone may also help women to fend off grave forms of the virus, as it boosts the re­sponse of T cells – which kill in­fected cells – and in­creases the pro­duc­tion of an­ti­bod­ies, the study said.</p>
    <p>“In con­trast, the male sex hor­mone testos­terone sup­presses the im­mune sys­tem,” the au­thors noted.</p>
