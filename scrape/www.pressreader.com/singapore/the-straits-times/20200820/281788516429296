    <p>LON­DON • A heap of new travel re­stric­tions has thrown Europe’s long-an­tic­i­pated Au­gust break into dis­ar­ray, deal­ing a set­back to air­lines and leav­ing some pas­sen­gers on the hook for the cost of last­minute changes.</p>
    <p>In the United King­dom, quar­an­tine mea­sures have been reim­posed on Spain, France, Malta and the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>With in­fec­tion rates ris­ing, Croa­tia could be next, creat­ing an­other headache for would-be trav­ellers who are run­ning out of time as schools re­open.</p>
    <p>Fin­land has re­moved most Euro­pean Union (EU) coun­tries from its “green travel list”, with only ar­rivals from a hand­ful of states now able to en­ter the coun­try with­out re­stric­tions, the govern­ment said yes­ter­day. The tougher rules, aimed at halt­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus, mean that only peo­ple com­ing from Italy, Hun­gary, Slo­vakia, Es­to­nia and Lithua­nia will be al­lowed into Fin­land with­out prov­ing they have a valid rea­son for travel and self-iso­lat­ing for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Ar­rivals from a num­ber of nonEU coun­tries, in­clud­ing Georgia, Rwanda and South Korea, con­tinue to be freely per­mit­ted un­der the mea­sures which will come into force next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ryanair Hold­ings, Europe’s big­gest dis­count car­rier, has cut back on sched­ules, say­ing the un­cer­tainty has de­terred peo­ple from book­ing trips. Deutsche Lufthansa’s Eurow­ings unit said on Tues­day it will cut ca­pac­ity to Spain, in re­sponse to a Ger­man travel warn­ing.</p>
    <p>An in­dus­try pro­posal to move the UK away from coun­try-based quar­an­tines is gain­ing mo­men­tum. The govern­ment is work­ing on ramp­ing up Covid-19 test­ing at air­ports, Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock said yes­ter­day, a move that could be used to ease the bur­den on trav­ellers to self­iso­late after ar­riv­ing from over­seas.</p>
    <p>The heads of air­lines in­clud­ing Bri­tish Air­ways, Ryanair, EasyJet Plc and Vir­gin At­lantic Air­ways pressed their case this week in a let­ter to Trans­port Sec­re­tary Grant Shapps, ask­ing for the quar­an­tine to be re­placed by tests for ar­rivals from high-risk coun­tries be­cause it is killing de­mand from big mar­kets like the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr Shapps is due to meet with min­is­ters on Mon­day to dis­cuss the al­ter­na­tives, The Daily Tele­graph news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>For those who al­ready have tick­ets, chang­ing plans has be­come a mine­field of terms and con­di­tions that vary by car­rier. While cus­tomers are en­ti­tled to a re­fund when an air­line can­cels a flight, they typ­i­cally have to work hard to get it, such as call­ing a busy cus­tomer-ser­vice desk. Car­ri­ers are also of­fer­ing vouch­ers or reschedul­ing for free, and mak­ing it eas­ier to se­lect these op­tions. When a flight is still op­er­at­ing but now sub­ject to quar­an­tine, the guide­lines are murky. Air­lines are not obliged to pay cash re­funds and gen­er­ally are re­fus­ing to do so on up­com­ing trips.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Fin­land’s Prime Min­is­ter Sanna Marin said yes­ter­day her Covid-19 test taken a day ear­lier was neg­a­tive, but she would con­tinue to work re­motely.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Health work&#xAD;ers (above) set to per&#xAD;form swab tests on pas&#xAD;sen&#xAD;gers from Spain at the Caselle air&#xAD;port in Turin. Italy has in&#xAD;tro&#xAD;duced manda&#xAD;tory Covid-19 test&#xAD;ing for any&#xAD;one ar&#xAD;riv&#xAD;ing from Croa&#xAD;tia, Greece, Spain, and Malta. Trav&#xAD;ellers at Lon&#xAD;don&#x2019;s Heathrow air&#xAD;port (below) also face strin&#xAD;gent checks. In the United King&#xAD;dom, quar&#xAD;an&#xAD;tine mea&#xAD;sures have been reim&#xAD;posed on Spain, France, Malta and the Nether&#xAD;lands.</p>
