    <p>A new po­lice dis­patch car will be hit­ting the road by 2024, as the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force re­places the cur­rent fleet with a model that has tech­no­log­i­cal fea­tures such as the abil­ity to de­tect ve­hi­cles of in­ter­est on the move.</p>
    <p>About 300 new Hyundai Tuc­son five-door com­pact sport util­ity ve­hi­cles will be rolled out pro­gres­sively, of which sev­eral are al­ready be­ing used by the po­lice’s Ground Re­sponse Force (GRF) of­fi­cers to re­spond quickly to emer­gency calls, among other du­ties.</p>
    <p>Deputy Su­per­in­ten­dent Ng Li Ki, op­er­a­tions of­fi­cer at the Front­line Polic­ing Divi­sion’s op­er­a­tions depart­ment, said the ve­hi­cle was de­vel­oped in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Home Team Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Agency, with the help of feed­back from of­fi­cers on the ground.</p>
    <p>It takes only sec­onds for of­fi­cers to de­tect ve­hi­cles of in­ter­est while driv­ing the new fast-re­sponse car, with the help of the new in-built au­to­mated num­ber plate recog­ni­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem can de­tect the make of the ve­hi­cle in ques­tion and match the li­cence plate num­ber to the po­lice data­base for ve­hi­cles of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Se­nior As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner of Po­lice How Kwang Hwee, di­rec­tor of op­er­a­tions, said the next-gen­er­a­tion fast-re­sponse car is a “key in­vest­ment that will fur­ther im­prove the op­er­a­tional ef­fec­tive­ness and safety of our ground of­fi­cers”.</p>
    <p>GRF of­fi­cers are usu­ally the first re­spon­ders to 999 calls, on top of car­ry­ing out other du­ties such as street pa­trolling and man­ning po­lice coun­ters.</p>
    <p>The new ve­hi­cle will also boast an in-ve­hi­cle video record­ing sys­tem that can live-stream high-res­o­lu­tion video footage to the Po­lice Op­er­a­tions Com­mand Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>An­other key fea­ture is the ra­diofre­quency iden­ti­fi­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy in the boot, which can help to track equip­ment such as riot shields and bul­let­proof vests in the ve­hi­cle, eliminatin­g the need for man­ual in­spec­tion by of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers can use and con­trol th­ese tech­no­log­i­cal fea­tures via a touch­screen dash­board.</p>
    <p>The driver and pas­sen­ger seats have been de­signed to al­low of­fi­cers wear­ing po­lice equip­ment on their belts to en­ter and exit the ve­hi­cle smoothly, and re­duce their dis­com­fort dur­ing long op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The rear seats have also been de­signed to pro­vide a space for hands cuffed be­hind the backs of per­sons in cus­tody, as well as a mech­a­nism for safe seat belt ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Th­ese next-gen­er­a­tion fas­tre­sponse cars also fea­ture ex­ter­nal mounted lights that can be used in low-light sit­u­a­tions, and a po­lice warn­ing sys­tem with a rum­bler that emits low-fre­quency sound waves to warn other mo­torists of the ve­hi­cle’s ap­proach.</p>
    <p>More ca­pa­bil­i­ties may be added to some of th­ese cars, such as a func­tion to de­tect, lo­cate and dis­rupt drones.</p>
    <p>Fast-re­sponse cars, which are the main po­lice cars in Sin­ga­pore, have mainly been sa­loon cars such as the Toy­ota Corolla Altis and the Hyundai Elantra.</p>
    <p>The po­lice’s new fast-re­sponse car will be the only as­set to make its Na­tional Day Pa­rade de­but this year.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic will be able to view the ve­hi­cle, which will be in­cluded in the mo­bile col­umn as part of the pa­rade, as it makes its way to heart­land ar­eas in Wood­lands, Bis­han and Gey­lang Serai.</p>
