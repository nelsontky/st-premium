    <p>Fin­tech com­pany Validus Cap­i­tal has joined Sin­ga­pore banks to of­fer gov­ern­ment-backed loans un­der an En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) scheme. The firm se­cured ap­proval this week to of­fer small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) fi­nanc­ing that has up to 90 per cent of the risk taken up by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>A Validus spokesman said the com­pany is us­ing data an­a­lyt­ics to as­sess the credit-wor­thi­ness of ap­pli­cants for the En­ter­prise Fi­nanc­ing Scheme by ac­count­ing for their pre- and post-Covid-19 per­for­mance. Among other things, Validus also screens SMEs for lit­i­ga­tion pro­cesses or those with bank­ruptcy pro­ceed­ings against di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>It ex­pects to dole out mainly work­ing cap­i­tal loans over the next six to nine months.</p>
    <p>Validus also es­ti­mates that it will stick with the usual loan size of be­tween $50,000 and $300,000 for each SME. The tenures are likely to be slightly shorter than those of banks, the com­pany’s spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Validus Cap­i­tal will use its bal­ance sheet to fund the loans un­der ESG schemes. This means these loans can­not be funded by peer-to-peer in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>“A lot of SMEs are bounc­ing back stronger as the econ­omy opens up,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Nikhilesh Goel said: “Through these... schemes, we look for­ward to play­ing a much larger role in ad­dress­ing the fi­nanc­ing needs of un­der­served SMEs and those im­pacted by the pan­demic.”</p>
