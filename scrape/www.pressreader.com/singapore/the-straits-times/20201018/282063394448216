    <p>In­dia’s lower-caste Dalit women have long strug­gled to get jus­tice for crimes against them in the In­dian jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Na­tional data and the ex­pe­ri­ences of sur­vivors and ac­tivists both re­veal that crimes against Dalit women see shod­dier in­ves­ti­ga­tion and fewer con­vic­tions than crimes against other women.</p>
    <p>Dalit Women Fight, a com­mu­nity-led or­gan­i­sa­tion to am­plify their voices, has been train­ing lo­cal women in five states for 15 years to mon­i­tor abuses, sup­port rape sur­vivors and pro­vide le­gal sup­port.</p>
    <p>Ms Riya Singh, an ac­tivist with the col­lec­tive, said: “We are re­signed to the re­al­ity that the govern­ment, who­ever is in power, will not change. Rapes and as­saults keep hap­pen­ing, there is brief pub­lic out­rage, me­dia cov­er­age, and that’s it. The caste hi­er­ar­chy and sys­temic vi­o­lence is deep in so­ci­ety, in­clud­ing po­lice and courts.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to data from In­dia’s Na­tional Crime Records Bureau, re­ported cases of rape against Dalit women and chil­dren rose by 37 per cent be­tween 2015 and 2019. The in­crease was faster than the 23 per cent rise in re­ported crimes against all women.</p>
    <p>Last year, there were 3,486 re­ported cases of rape against Dal­its and an­other 3,375 cases of sex­ual as­sault. Most re­ported rape cases were recorded in Ra­jasthan; the rate of re­ported crimes, which con­sid­ers a state’s Dalit pop­u­la­tion, was high­est in Ker­ala.</p>
    <p>Pro­longed de­lays in in­ves­ti­ga­tion and pros­e­cu­tion of crimes in In­dia are com­mon, but Dalit ac­tivists said the sys­tem probed crimes against Dal­its es­pe­cially slowly.</p>
    <p>Ms Delta Megh­wal, a 19-year-old Dalit, was al­legedly raped by a teacher and found dead in a water tank in 2016. Af­ter four years, the case is still pend­ing hear­ing in the low­est court. Ac­tivists work­ing with her fam­ily said her father “felt re­signed”.</p>
    <p>Of the re­ported rape cases against Dal­its last year, over a quar­ter were yet to be in­ves­ti­gated by the po­lice by the end of the year. Of the about 12,500 that made it to court that year, over 91 per cent were still pend­ing trial at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>While the over­all con­vic­tion rate for rape cases in In­dia is 25 per cent, it is only 2 per cent when the vic­tim is a Dalit woman.</p>
    <p>In­dia has spe­cial laws to ad­dress of­fences against Dalit and Adi­vasi peo­ple, but lawyers and ac­tivists say that un­der-re­port­ing is still wide­spread.</p>
    <p>A re­port pub­lished last month by the Com­mon­wealth Hu­man Rights Ini­tia­tive found that sur­vivors of rape had faced “de­lay, de­ri­sion, pres­sure and se­vere ha­rass­ment when they ap­proach the po­lice to re­port com­plaints”. A prom­i­nent na­tion­wide health sur­vey from 2015-16 found that 99 per cent of all sex­ual vi­o­lence cases go un­re­ported to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cess to so­cial me­dia, ed­u­ca­tion and op­por­tu­ni­ties has made more Dalit women em­pow­ered and vo­cal. But speak­ing up and re­port­ing crimes won’t change much un­til the mind­set of per­pe­tra­tors, po­lice and govern­ment changes,” said Ms Singh.</p>
    <p>Ms Singh and 10 other prom­i­nent ac­tivists filed a pe­ti­tion in the Supreme Court de­mand­ing that an im­par­tial agency in­ves­ti­gate Septem­ber’s al­leged gang-rape of a 19-year-old in Hathras, Ut­tar Pradesh.</p>
    <p>It “is not an iso­lated in­ci­dent but ac­tu­ally stems from the coun­try’s long op­pres­sive his­tory based on caste that con­tin­ues even in 2020,” their pe­ti­tion says.</p>
