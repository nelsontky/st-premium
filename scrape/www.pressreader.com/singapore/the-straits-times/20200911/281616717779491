    <p>Seven days ago, the High Court over­turned the con­vic­tions against for­mer maid Parti Liyani, 46, who had faced four charges of steal­ing about $34,000 worth of items from for­mer cor­po­rate chief Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily. Four days later, Ms Parti, who had worked for the Liews from 2007 to 2016, was cleared of a fifth charge of fraud­u­lent pos­ses­sion of prop­erty, mak­ing her free of all crim­i­nal charges.</p>
    <p>OCT 28, 2016</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Parti Liyani had a rel­a­tively har­mo­nious re­la­tion­ship with the fam­ily, ex­cept for clashes with Mr Liew’s son, Karl, over her house­hold chores at the fam­ily’s home in Chancery Lane.</p>
    <p>Things got more heated when Mr Karl Liew moved out with his fam­ily in March 2016 to a nearby house. She was asked to go to his home to help with the chores, as well as clean his of­fice in another lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>On Oct 28, 2016, the Liew fam­ily ter­mi­nated her em­ploy­ment, af­ter she had ex­pressed un­hap­pi­ness at be­ing made to do ad­di­tional work.</p>
    <p>Given two hours to pack her be­long­ings into three jumbo boxes, she be­came an­gry and threat­ened to com­plain to the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) about the il­le­gal work de­ploy­ments. She re­turned to In­done­sia the same day, af­ter ask­ing Mr Karl Liew to pay for the boxes to be shipped to her.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment last Fri­day, Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn said: “There is rea­son to be­lieve that the Liew fam­ily, upon re­al­is­ing her un­hap­pi­ness, took the pre-emp­tive first step to ter­mi­nate her em­ploy­ment sud­denly, with­out giv­ing her suf­fi­cient time for her to pack, in the hope that Parti would not use the time to make a com­plaint to MOM.”</p>
    <p>OCT 29, 2016</p>
    <p>The Liew fam­ily opened the boxes, checked the con­tents and took a 21-sec­ond video of items they had re­moved from the boxes. They al­leged that the items be­longed to mem­bers of their fam­ily.</p>
    <p>OCT 30, 2016</p>
    <p>While Ms Parti was back in In­done­sia, Mr Liew and his son made a po­lice re­port af­ter the fam­ily al­legedly found their be­long­ings in three boxes, which Mr Karl Liew had agreed to pay to ship to her. Af­ter the re­port was made, the fam­ily mem­bers were told by the po­lice they were free to use the items. They took and put back items into the boxes but it is not clear if the items were the same ones that were re­moved ear­lier.</p>
    <p>DEC 2, 2016</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, who was un­aware of the al­le­ga­tions made against her, re­turned to Singapore to find work, but was ar­rested on ar­rival at Changi Air­port. Items that al­legedly be­longed to the fam­ily were found on her.</p>
    <p>DEC 3, 2016</p>
    <p>The po­lice vis­ited the Liews’ house with a crime scene pho­tog­ra­pher to take pho­tos of the al­legedly stolen items, but it was done about five weeks af­ter the re­port was made.</p>
    <p>AU­GUST 2017</p>
    <p>Ms Parti faced four charges of theft, in­volv­ing 144 items val­ued at about $50,000.</p>
    <p>OC­TO­BER 2017</p>
    <p>Ms Parti made a re­port to MOM about be­ing il­le­gally de­ployed to work at Mr Karl Liew’s home be­tween Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber 2016, and to his of­fice in 2012 and 2013.</p>
    <p>APRIL 23, 2018</p>
    <p>Ms Parti claimed trial. She was ac­cused of steal­ing more than $50,000 worth of valu­ables from the Liew fam­ily in Oc­to­ber 2016, in­clud­ing a $25,000 Ger­ald Genta watch from Mr Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>While out on bail, she stayed at a shel­ter run by mi­grant work­ers group Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­grant Eco­nomics (Home). Lawyer Anil Balchan­dani, whom Home ap­proached, rep­re­sented her pro bono.</p>
    <p>MAY 2018</p>
    <p>MOM con­cluded its probe into her com­plaint and found Mr Liew’s wife had de­ployed her to the younger Liew’s home and of­fice on dif­fer­ent oc­ca­sions. MOM is­sued a cau­tion to Mrs Liew and an ad­vi­sory to Mr Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>MARCH 20, 2019</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was found guilty on four counts of theft by District Judge Olivia Low. She was sen­tenced to jail for two years and two months.</p>
    <p>She was convicted of steal­ing $34,000 worth of items, in­clud­ing the Ger­ald Genta watch. Mr Karl Liew claimed it was worth $25,000, but the trial judge re­duced it to $10,000 based on the orig­i­nal guide price.</p>
    <p>The judge said she did not see any rea­son for the Liews to frame the maid for theft. She added that the pros­e­cu­tion wit­nesses were “largely cred­i­ble and con­sis­tent”, even though they might have dif­fered slightly on the de­tails of their items.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti ap­pealed against the con­vic­tions.</p>
    <p>SEPT 4, 2020</p>
    <p>The High Court over­turned the con­vic­tions. Her lawyer Anil Balchan­dani ar­gued that the po­lice re­port was a pre-emp­tive move to stop her from mak­ing a com­plaint against the Liews for il­le­gal de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn, in his 100-page judg­ment, found the trial judge’s con­vic­tion against her to be “un­safe”. He cited the po­lice han­dling of the ev­i­dence, record­ing of the al­legedly stolen items and im­proper mo­tive be­hind the al­le­ga­tions of some fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>SEPT 6, 2020</p>
    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, po­lice and MOM said they are re­view­ing the han­dling of the case.</p>
    <p>SEPT 8, 2020</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was granted a dis­charge amount­ing to an ac­quit­tal for the fifth charge, for fraud­u­lent pos­ses­sion of prop­erty, af­ter the pros­e­cu­tion dropped the charge against her. This charge is re­lated to 18 items in her pos­ses­sion that are not linked to the Liews.</p>
    <p>Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said the au­thor­i­ties take very se­ri­ously Jus­tice Chan’s com­ments on the case, and have to find out “what hap­pened, why it hap­pened and then deal with it”.</p>
    <p>SEPT 10, 2020</p>
    <p>Mr Liew steps down as chair­man of Changi Air­port Group and Sur­bana Jurong. He also re­signs from his po­si­tions as se­nior in­ter­na­tional busi­ness ad­viser at Singapore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek and as a board mem­ber of Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
