    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>A dream has a big mes­sage for you, but you need to let it un­wind over time be­fore act­ing on it. The good news is that it is not ur­gent, so write it down or pon­der over it for a few days or weeks.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your in­tu­itive side is ac­tive, so you should be able to get a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of friends and en­e­mies. That does not mean it all makes sense in­stantly, just that it is eas­ier.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>It is a good time for you to hun­ker down and work on your own, if pos­si­ble. Com­mu­ni­ca­tion is much harder than usual and that puts you at a se­ri­ous, if tem­po­rary, dis­ad­van­tage. Wait it out.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>It al­most does not mat­ter what you do – things just feel right. You and your peo­ple are get­ting along well and you should find you can get them to see things your way with ease.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You just can­not get a good read on a weird prob­lem, so put it off for a while. Some­times, you have to let is­sues per­co­late be­fore you can fig­ure out what you are sup­posed to do next.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Noth­ing much is hap­pen­ing and there is noth­ing wrong with that. Ev­ery­one needs time to re­lax, so if you find your­self ner­vously try­ing to fig­ure out what to do, just chill out.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You have the men­tal flex­i­bil­ity to cope with weird­ness, but you have to be will­ing to chal­lenge your­self in or­der to use it. Ask im­por­tant ques­tions, chiefly of your­self.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Art is be­com­ing a new ob­ses­sion for you and your play­ful en­ergy helps you to see what is best in the ma­te­rial you have to work with. It is a great time to im­press the cul­tural elite.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Make sure to think big – oth­er­wise, you may have to tread wa­ter while those around you take off for new hori­zons. Try to make some for­ward mo­tions as soon as you can.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your big heart grows a lit­tle big­ger and you may find your­self dig­ging within your pock­et­book to help some­one in need. It may not be money he or she is af­ter, so think out­side the box.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>When a friend comes your way once again with a hor­ror story or a re­quest for as­sis­tance, the com­pas­sion­ate thing to do may be to turn him or her away firmly but lov­ingly. Try it out.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You need to make a ma­jor change, so start within your­self. It is a good time to ask friends and fam­ily for ad­vice, though you may have to fil­ter it a bit to make sense of it.</p>
