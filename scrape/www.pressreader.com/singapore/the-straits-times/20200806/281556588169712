    <p>In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi yes­ter­day laid the foun­da­tion stone for the con­struc­tion of a tem­ple for Lord Ram on a con­tro­ver­sial site. He took part in prayers with a hand­ful of oth­ers at a live-streamed cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>NEW DELHI • Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi yes­ter­day said “a long wait has ended” af­ter lay­ing the foun­da­tion stone for the con­struc­tion of a tem­ple for Lord Ram on a site that has been con­tro­ver­sial for cen­turies.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion of the tem­ple in the city of Ay­o­d­hya, a long­stand­ing prom­ise of Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), be­gan nine months af­ter the Supreme Court handed over the site to Hindu groups and pro­vided al­ter­na­tive land to Mus­lims for a mosque which once stood in the area.</p>
    <p>“Many are amazed this has hap­pened in their life­time... a decades­long wait has come to an end,” said Mr Modi.</p>
    <p>Call­ing it an “emo­tional mo­ment” for the coun­try, he said a grand tem­ple would now be built for Lord Ram.</p>
    <p>“The wait of cen­turies has ended and In­dia is cre­at­ing a golden chap­ter in Ay­o­d­hya,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi took part in prayers along with a hand­ful of oth­ers at the cer­e­mony which was live streamed on news chan­nels.</p>
    <p>Only 175 peo­ple were at the venue it­self and the scaled-down at­ten­dance was due to the spike in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Home Min­is­ter Amit Shah is among more than 1.9 mil­lion peo­ple who have tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>The build­ing of the Lord Ram tem­ple pro­pelled the BJP to cen­tre stage in In­dian pol­i­tics as the party – with its mes­sage of Hindu nationalis­m – emerged stronger with a cam­paign crafted around the is­sue.</p>
    <p>In 1992, a Hindu mob de­mol­ished the 16th-cen­tury Babri Masjid or Babri mosque, which stood on the same site that many Hin­dus be­lieve is the birth­place of Lord Ram.</p>
    <p>The demolition, which the Supreme Court last year called a “vi­o­la­tion of the rule of l aw”, fanned com­mu­nal ten­sions and led di­rectly to the deaths of over 2,000 peo­ple in com­mu­nal ri­ots and deep­en­ing re­li­gious fault lines within the coun­try.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said Mr Modi’s speech af­ter yes­ter­day’s cer­e­mony was aimed at BJP sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>“It was a clear mes­sage to the core sup­port­ers of the BJP that we have ful­filled the prom­ise,” said po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst San­deep Shas­tri.</p>
    <p>The main op­po­si­tion Con­gress party wel­comed the be­gin­ning of the con­struc­tion of the tem­ple, ex­pected to be com­pleted just be­fore the 2024 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Many hope the start of con­struc­tion will bring some clo­sure to the frac­tious his­tory con­nected with the site and its po­lar­is­ing ef­fect on the South Asian coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Hin­dus­tan Times news­pa­per in an ed­i­to­rial said that the tem­ple “is a po­lit­i­cal, in­tel­lec­tual and le­gal vic­tory for the Rashtriya Swayam­se­vak Sangh, for the BJP... for Mr Modi him­self whose po­lit­i­cal life has co­in­cided with the rise of Hindu po­lit­i­cal con­scious­ness, and for mil­lions of devo­tees who wanted to see a tem­ple at the dis­puted site”.</p>
    <p>The Rashtriya Swayam­se­vak Sangh is known as the ide­o­log­i­cal back­bone of the BJP.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, the con­tentious his­tory lead­ing up to the tem­ple can­not be erased. The fact that Mus­lims have abided by the rule of law and ac­cepted the SC (Supreme Court) ver­dict in the spirit of clo­sure is laud­able – but can­not take away from the in­se­cu­rity they have felt at the po­lit­i­cal mo­bil­i­sa­tion around the is­sue,” the news­pa­per added.</p>
    <p>On Twit­ter #Re­turnBabri­land­toMus­lims and #Hin­dus were si­mul­ta­ne­ously trend­ing at one point yes­ter­day in a re­flec­tion of the strong sen­ti­ments still at play.</p>
