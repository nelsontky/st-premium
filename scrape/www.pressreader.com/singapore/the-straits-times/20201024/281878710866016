    <p>BEIJING • Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping yes­ter­day warned of China’s mil­i­tary re­solve to de­feat “in­vaders”, speak­ing on the 70th an­niver­sary of the Korean War, the only time Chi­nese forces have fought the US.</p>
    <p>In a long speech, heavy on pa­tri­o­tism and flecked by anec­dotes of hero­ism by Chi­nese forces, Mr Xi said vic­tory in the 1950-53 con­flict was a re­minder that his na­tion stood ready to fight any­one “cre­at­ing trou­ble... on China’s doorstep”.</p>
    <p>Beijing of­ten uses war an­niver­saries to fire thinly cov­ered warn­ings to the United States of the mil­i­tary strength of the “new China”.</p>
    <p>The Korean War is a key foun­da­tion story for the rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party. Yes­ter­day’s an­niver­sary came a day af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump – who has sparked off a bit­ter row with Beijing span­ning trade, tech­nol­ogy, hu­man rights and the sta­tus of Tai­wan – sparred with his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den on relations with China and trade, among other is­sues.</p>
    <p>With­out ex­plic­itly nam­ing the US, Mr Xi loaded up with the his­tor­i­cal prece­dent of the Korean War and took swings at mod­ern-day “uni­lat­er­al­ism, pro­tec­tion­ism and ex­treme ego­ism”.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese peo­ple don’t create trou­bles, nor are we afraid of them,” he said to ap­plause. “We will never sit back and watch any dam­age to our na­tional sovereignt­y... and we will never al­low any force to in­vade or di­vide the sa­cred ter­ri­tory of the moth­er­land.”</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the Pen­tagon an­nounced it had agreed to sell more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.36 bil­lion) worth of mis­siles to self-gov­ern­ing Tai­wan, the sharpest po­ten­tial flash­point with US forces.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, more than 197,000 Chi­nese sol­diers died dur­ing the three-year Korean War, which saw the US-led United Na­tions coali­tion pushed back to the 38th par­al­lel bi­sect­ing the Korean Penin­sula, af­ter China weighed in on the side of North Korea’s com­mu­nist army.</p>
    <p>The war, es­sen­tially fought to a bloody stale­mate, is hailed in China as a vic­tory and an ex­am­ple of re­silience and spirit against a more ad­vanced foe.</p>
    <p>“When China was very poor, it didn’t sur­ren­der to US pres­sure,” an ed­i­to­rial in the na­tion­al­ist Global Times said this week. “To­day, China has grown to be a strong coun­try, so there is no rea­son for China to fear the US threats and sup­pres­sion.”</p>
    <p>Chi­nese state me­dia has un­leashed a wave of pro­pa­ganda with daily in­ter­views with Chi­nese vet­er­ans who sur­vived the war dur­ing prime-time news over the past week.</p>
    <p>An ac­tion-thriller, Sacri­fice, directed by three of the big­gest names in Chi­nese cin­ema and de­pict­ing a small band of Chi­nese troops hold­ing off US forces in the fi­nal days of the war, hit cin­e­mas across the coun­try yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>By com­mem­o­rat­ing the an­niver­sary, “China is declar­ing to the US that it was not afraid of the US in the past, and is still not afraid of the US now,” said pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics Shi Yin­hong of Ren­min Univer­sity. “It’s to pre­pare for a pos­si­ble lim­ited mil­i­tary con­flict with the US.”</p>
