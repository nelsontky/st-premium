    <p>KAL­BA­JAR (Azer­bai­jan) • Azer­bai­jan said yes­ter­day it had agreed to ex­tend a dead­line for Ar­me­nia to with­draw from a dis­puted district as part of a peace ac­cord that ended six weeks of fierce fight­ing over Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of the Kal­ba­jar district in Azer­bai­jan, which has been con­trolled by Ar­me­nian sep­a­ratists since a 1990s post-Soviet war, be­gan a mass ex­o­dus in the days lead­ing up to the ini­tial with­drawal dead­line yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But a for­eign pol­icy ad­viser to Azer­bai­jan Pres­i­dent Il­ham Aliyev said his coun­try had ex­tended the dead­line be­cause of hu­man­i­tar­ian con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Hik­met Ha­jiyev said the with­drawal of “Ar­me­nian armed forces and of il­le­gal Ar­me­nian set­tlers” was de­layed un­til Nov 25, fol­low­ing an ap­peal from Ar­me­nia and me­di­a­tion with Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin.</p>
    <p>“Kal­ba­jar’s set­tle­ment by Ar­me­ni­ans was il­le­gal. The peo­ple who were re­set­tled there have no prop­erty rights,” Mr Ha­jiyev told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Kal­ba­jar was al­most ex­clu­sively pop­u­lated by eth­nic Azer­bai­ja­nis be­fore they were ex­pelled by Ar­me­ni­ans in the 1990s war be­tween the two coun­tries over NagornoKar­abakh, and a ma­jor­ity of the homes be­ing aban­doned pre­vi­ously be­longed to Azer­bai­ja­nis.</p>
    <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) jour­nal­ists saw flee­ing res­i­dents pile fur­ni­ture and kitchen­ware into ve­hi­cles be­fore leav­ing for Ar­me­nia on the week­end.</p>
    <p>Smoke rose over the val­ley near the vil­lage of Charektar after res­i­dents set their homes on fire, pre­fer­ring to leave dev­as­ta­tion in their wake and homes that would be un­in­hab­it­able by Azer­bai­ja­nis.</p>
    <p>“We also moved our par­ents’ graves, the Azer­bai­ja­nis will take great plea­sure in des­e­crat­ing our graves. It’s un­bear­able,” one Charektar res­i­dent said.</p>
    <p>A Rus­sian peace­keep­ing con­tin­gent sent to Nagorno-Karabakh has set up check­points and po­si­tions in the re­gion’s ad­min­is­tra­tive cen­tre Stepanaker­t. The de­ploy­ment was part of the peace deal, which sees Ar­me­nia cede ter­ri­tory that Azer­bai­jan’s forces gained in the weeks of fight­ing.</p>
    <p>Moscow’s peace­keep­ing mis­sion, which the mil­i­tary said in­cluded sol­diers that were pre­vi­ously sta­tioned in Syria, com­prises some 2,000 troops for a re­new­able five-year mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The De­fence Min­istry said yes­ter­day that over two days, it had es­corted more than 700 peo­ple re­turn­ing to Stepanaker­t, which was shelled heav­ily dur­ing the fight­ing.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Soviet ri­vals agreed to end hos­til­i­ties last week after ef­forts by Rus­sia, France and the US to get a cease­fire fell through dur­ing the nearly two months of clashes. A key part of the peace deal in­cludes Ar­me­nia’s re­turn of Kal­ba­jar, as well as the Agh­dam district by Nov 20 and the Lachin district by Dec 1, which have been held by Ar­me­ni­ans since the 1990s war that left 30,000 peo­ple dead.</p>
    <p>Mr Ha­jiyev said yes­ter­day the timetable for the Ar­me­nian with­drawal of the re­main­ing dis­tricts was un­changed.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia has said 2,317 of its fight­ers were killed in clashes in which both sides ac­cused the other of tar­get­ing civil­ian in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan has not re­vealed its mil­i­tary ca­su­al­ties, but Mr Putin said the num­ber of deaths on both sides sur­passed 4,000 and that tens of thou­sands of peo­ple had been forced to flee their homes.</p>
    <p>Be­fore de­part­ing en masse, Ar­me­ni­ans flocked to the Dadi­vank monastery nes­tled in a Kal­ba­jar gorge for a fi­nal visit.</p>
    <p>AFP jour­nal­ists wit­nessed a dozen women ask­ing to be bap­tised at the re­li­gious site.</p>
