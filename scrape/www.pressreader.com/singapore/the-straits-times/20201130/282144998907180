    <p>This cafe in Boat Quay bills it­self as the purr­fect place to hang out, pun firmly in­tended.</p>
    <p>Cat Cafe Neko no Niwa has cats freely roam­ing around, and for a fee, cus­tomers can play with and groom the an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the own­ers started work­ing with in­struc­tors from Equal – a char­ity known for its horse-based ther­apy tar­get­ing youth, per­sons with spe­cial needs, fam­i­lies and the el­derly with clin­i­cal de­pres­sion and de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>The four in­struc­tors train 18- to 20-year-old stu­dents with mild in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity from the Associatio­n for Per­sons with Spe­cial Needs (APSN) Delta Se­nior School (DSS) to work in an­i­mal-re­lated in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>The 10-week pi­lot pro­gramme with the cafe, called Job Sa­fari, is both an­i­mal-based ther­apy and job train­ing. The place is closed for two hours in the morn­ing, four times a week, to fa­cil­i­tate train­ing.</p>
    <p>Each ses­sion has 10 stu­dents who are split into groups.</p>
    <p>“For some of them, it is ac­tu­ally their first ex­pe­ri­ence with cats,” says Ms Jamie Lee, an in­struc­tor with Equal.</p>
    <p>Most of the stu­dents are en­thralled by the sight of the 11 res­cued cats that have called the cafe</p>
    <p>home for seven years.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tu­tions such as APSN DSS cater to post-sec­ondary youth, fo­cus­ing on ed­u­ca­tion and job place­ment. They are usu­ally trained in</p>
    <p>vo­ca­tional do­mains, such as food and bev­er­age as well as ho­tel and ac­com­mo­da­tion ser­vices, which have been hard hit by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“In­creas­ing a per­son’s affin­ity to</p>
    <p>wards an­i­mal care also in­creases his job op­tions, as this is a boom­ing and thriv­ing in­dus­try,” says APSN DSS prin­ci­pal Subash Lazar.</p>
    <p>Equal chief ex­ec­u­tive Ng Tze</p>
    <p>Yong says, in an­i­mal ther­apy, the re­la­tion­ship you have with small and big an­i­mals is very dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>With smaller an­i­mals, hu­mans are less afraid and there would be ten­den­cies to over­reach.</p>
    <p>“I think that cre­ates nat­u­ral mo­ments for us to teach them how to be pa­tient and how to re­spect bound­aries,” he adds.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents spend two ses­sions a week, for five weeks, at the cafe.</p>
    <p>“We start by teach­ing them sci­en­tif­i­cally ac­cepted truths about the na­ture of cats. Like how cats are cau­tious, and how they learn about their world us­ing their sense of smell. Af­ter we have es­tab­lished these truths, we quickly pro­vide many ex­am­ples to the stu­dents so that they may be able to vi­su­alise what we’ve said,” says cafe coowner Sa­muel Chua.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents even­tu­ally grad­u­ate to groom­ing the cats. Build­ing on the con­fi­dence gained, they move on to the job train­ing, ei­ther at cat shel­ter Mutts & Mit­tens or the Catopia Cafe, where they spend the next five weeks doing mostly clean­ing.</p>
    <p>Equal later works with the school to try to find jobs for the stu­dents in the re­lated in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng says for per­sons with spe­cial needs to help shel­ter cats, “it re­frames their iden­tity from care re­cip­i­ent to a care­giver”.</p>
    <p>For per­sons with spe­cial needs to help shel­ter cats, I think it does some­thing to them. It re­frames their iden­tity from care re­cip­i­ent to a care­giver.</p>
    <p>MR NG TZE YONG, chief ex­ec­u­tive of char­ity Equal, on the im­pact of the pro­gramme on the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ing a per­son’s affin­ity to­wards an­i­mal care also in­creases his job op­tions, as this is a boom­ing and thriv­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>APSN DSS PRIN­CI­PAL SUBASH LAZAR, not­ing how Covid-19 has dealt ma­jor blows to ca­reers in hos­pi­tal­ity and F&B.</p>
