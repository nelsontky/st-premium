    <p>More than 300,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans have spent their Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers to book ho­tels, at­trac­tions and tours since re­demp­tions be­gan on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>As at Jan 1, the book­ings amounted to $35.9 mil­lion i n vouch­ers and pay­ments, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers can be spent on more than 440 prod­ucts avail­able across the five au­tho­rised book­ing plat­forms: Changi Rec­om­mends, Glob­alTix, Trav­eloka, Trip.com and Klook.</p>
    <p>“We are heart­ened by the in­ter­est that Sin­ga­pore­ans have shown in the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers,” said STB. It added that it would con­tinue to work with the tourism sec­tor to roll out more such deals.</p>
    <p>As part of STB’s out­reach ef­forts, it has de­ployed am­bas­sadors at 53 com­mu­nity cen­tres and clubs is­land­wide to help those with queries about the vouch­ers. The am­bas­sadors have as­sisted close to 63,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans as at Jan 1.</p>
    <p>En­cour­ag­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to make full use of their vouch­ers over the next six months, STB re­minded them to book time slots for at­trac­tions and tours be­fore­hand.</p>
    <p>“This is to en­sure they are able to visit and re­dis­cover Sin­ga­pore at their pre­ferred time,” said STB.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the De­cem­ber school hol­i­days, many peo­ple re­port­edly could not use their tick­ets for fully booked at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>Some of the at­trac­tions that were fully booked for the first week of this month in­cluded S.E.A. Aquar­ium and Head­Rock VR.</p>
    <p>While var­i­ous at­trac­tions have in­tro­duced time slots to avoid over­crowd­ing, not all Sin­ga­pore­ans were aware of this re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral vis­i­tors to Sen­tosa in­clud­ing Ms Grace Bri­ones, 40, were de­nied en­try at var­i­ous at­trac­tions be­cause they showed up with­out book­ing a time slot.</p>
    <p>“You as­sume it’s com­pleted be­cause you get a con­fir­ma­tion email but that’s just half of the book­ing process,” said the mar­ket­ing man­ager, who had pur­chased tick­ets for Universal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore on Dec 28 but did not book a slot.</p>
    <p>If cus­tomers do not book a time slot, they may be able to change the date of their visit or get a re­fund. How­ever, this de­pends on the terms and con­di­tions of in­di­vid­ual at­trac­tions and their ar­range­ments with the book­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that cus­tomers book a time slot, some plat­forms have is­sued re­minders.</p>
    <p>Since early last month, book­ing plat­form Klook has re­quired cus­tomers to check a box when mak­ing pay­ment for a ticket, to ac­knowl­edge that they are aware of the need to book a time slot.</p>
    <p>Trav­eloka also said on Dec 30 that it will be adding ad­di­tional in­for­ma­tion to re­mind cus­tomers to book a time slot when they pur­chase the Sen­tosa FunPass via its web­site.</p>
