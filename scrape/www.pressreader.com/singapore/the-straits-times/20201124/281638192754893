    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s over­all trade and non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) are fore­cast to grow next year, in line with pre­dic­tions that the global econ­omy will ex­pand over the next year from a low base.</p>
    <p>To­tal mer­chan­dise trade is ex­pected to rise by 1 per cent to 3 per cent for next year, while Nodx is pro­jected to ex­pand by zero to 2 per cent, gov­ern­ment agency En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) said in its re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Emily Liew, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for cor­po­rate and strate­gic plan­ning at ESG, said a con­ser­va­tive fore­cast was made for next year given the un­cer­tainty in the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>She noted that the over­all Nodx fore­cast for 2021 is an ex­ten­sion of the grad­ual re­cov­ery from the 2020 base.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, there con­tin­ues to be down­side risks such as US-China trade ten­sions and un­cer­tainty over the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion glob­ally in 2021, which may im­pact the re­cov­ery tra­jec­tory of Sin­ga­pore’s key trade part­ners and, in turn, weigh on de­mand and global trade,” she said. “The path to re­cov­ery is ex­pected to be slow and un­even across economies, and hence, the fore­casts re­main cau­tiously op­ti­mistic at this point in time.”</p>
    <p>ESG raised its fore­cast for the Repub­lic’s to­tal mer­chan­dise trade this year, pre­dict­ing it to shrink at a slower pace of 7.5 per cent to 7 per cent over last year, com­pared with the 10 per cent to 8 per cent slide fore­cast in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Nodx this year is tipped to grow by 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent year on year, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous fore­cast of 3 per cent to 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The re­vised pre­dic­tions were made amid bet­terthan-ex­pected per­for­mance for spe­cific prod­ucts such as non-mone­tary gold and spe­cialised ma­chin­ery, as well as elec­tron­ics, ESG said.</p>
    <p>Non-oil ship­ments ex­panded by 6.5 per cent in the third quar­ter on growth in both elec­tronic and non­elec­tronic Nodx, adding to the 5.9 per cent rise from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Non-elec­tronic Nodx grew 5.7 per cent for the third quar­ter, up slightly from the 4.6 per cent year-on-year in­crease seen in the pre­vi­ous three-month pe­riod. Elec­tron­ics ex­ports ex­panded by 9.5 per cent, com­pared with the 10.6 per cent rise from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>While to­tal trade per­formed slightly bet­ter than ex­pected in the third quar­ter, de­clin­ing 6.3 per cent com­pared with last year and eas­ing from the 15.3 per cent year-on-year con­trac­tion recorded in the sec­ond quar­ter, it is still likely to see neg­a­tive growth for the year.</p>
    <p>This is due to a de­cline in oil trade, down 39.5 per cent year on year, amid lower oil prices and weaker de­mand than a year ago.</p>
    <p>Non-oil trade, on the other hand, bounced back in the third quar­ter, record­ing 0.8 per cent year-onyear growth.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, to­tal ser­vices trade de­clined by 18.5 per cent in the third quar­ter, im­prov­ing slightly from the 22.4 per cent con­trac­tion recorded in the pre­vi­ous pe­riod.</p>
    <p>It reached $111.9 bil­lion for the three-month pe­riod, with ex­ports dip­ping 17.8 per cent, while im­ports were down 19.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>De­clines in ser­vices ex­ports were at­trib­uted to the de­crease in travel re­ceipts, trans­port ser­vices ex­ports and main­te­nance and re­pair ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, ESG noted that the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund ex­pects the global econ­omy to grow 5.2 per cent from a lower base in the com­ing year.</p>
    <p>It also high­lighted that the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion ex­pects global trade to re­bound to 7.2 per cent next year. Higher ex­pected oil prices next year may pro­vide some sup­port to Sin­ga­pore’s oil trade and to­tal trade for the year as a re­sult, ESG added.</p>
