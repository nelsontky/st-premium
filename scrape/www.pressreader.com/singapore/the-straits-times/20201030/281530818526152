    <p>Dear ST Reader,</p>
    <p>On July 15, 1845, the first edi­tion of The Straits Times hit the news-stands here in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>To­day, 175 years later, more peo­ple than ever be­fore are read­ing ST, in many more ways – not just in print, but also on­line, on your phones, desk­tops, tablets, through our web­site and app, en­gag­ing with our cor­re­spon­dents through video, on the ra­dio, our pod­casts and events.</p>
    <p>Hap­pily, many of these read­ers are younger ones too, with ST dom­i­nat­ing au­di­ence share among younger seg­ments, as sev­eral re­cent sur­veys have shown.</p>
    <p>To build on this, we have re­designed all our prod­ucts across plat­forms, tak­ing a con­tent-driven ap­proach, rather than fo­cus­ing only on aes­thetic changes, for this re­vamp.</p>
    <p>We have thought long and hard about how you choose to read ST, when and where, and have strived to meet these needs.</p>
    <p>Our role, as al­ways, re­mains to tell the sto­ries of our times, re­li­ably and cred­i­bly, aim­ing al­ways to be timely, trusted and true.</p>
    <p>We will play to the re­spec­tive strengths of each plat­form, bring­ing these sto­ries to life in words, pic­tures, videos, in­ter­ac­tive graph­ics, pod­casts, on the ra­dio, news­let­ters and events.</p>
    <p>So pop­u­lar fea­tures, like Lunch with Su­miko, will come not only as long reads, but also as videos and pod­casts.</p>
    <p>Our Life cor­re­spon­dents, in­clud­ing Food writ­ers Tan Hsueh Yun and Wong Ah Yoke, will of­fer their top picks of where to eat, places to hang out or movies to watch, in a Life Week­end edi­tion on Fri­days.</p>
    <p>They will also go on air, on our reg­u­lar show, The Big Story, live on our web­site, Face­book and YouTube on Thurs­day evenings. In ad­di­tion to The Big Story, which runs daily at 5.30pm, we have added a new daily round-up, ST News Night at 9pm, while our new ST Live, will bring you break­ing news sto­ries as they hap­pen from the ground, pushed to alert you on your app.</p>
    <p>Among the changes in this re­vamp you will find:</p>
    <p>• Some­thing old: Our long­stand­ing com­mit­ment to striv­ing to be ac­cu­rate, bal­anced and fair re­mains un­changed, with re­spected cor­re­spon­dents and columnists, in Sin­ga­pore and around the world. We re­main fo­cused on cov­er­ing com­pre­hen­sively and au­thor­i­ta­tively the key sto­ries re­lated to Sin­ga­pore, Asia, cli­mate change as well as the changes in our so­ci­ety brought on by sweep­ing tech­no­log­i­cal change, and the cur­rent Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>• Some­thing new: There are new col­umns and fea­tures, new forms of sto­ry­telling, such as the Dis­cover sec­tion on our web­site and app.</p>
    <p>• Much more vis­ual: More photo es­says, news and fea­ture videos, in­ter­ac­tive graph­ics, and on­line pro­gram­ming, in­clud­ing pod­casts.</p>
    <p>• A lot more views: Your week­end now starts on Satur­day, and we will give you much to pon­der in a beefed up News Fo­cus sec­tion. This in­cludes Asian In­sider fea­tures by our cor­re­spon­dents abroad, as well as our In­sight com­men­taries. On Sun­days, we will have a new Views sec­tion, with thought­ful pieces by some of our best writ­ers, such as Ro­hit Bri­j­nath and Olivia Ho.</p>
    <p>In mak­ing these changes, we have taken on board feed­back from read­ers and stake­hold­ers. Yes, we heard the call for a larger font size in print, as you can see.</p>
    <p>We won’t stop here and will keep striv­ing to im­prove to serve you bet­ter. So please send us your thoughts and feed­back.</p>
    <p>Thank you for read­ing The Straits Times.</p>
