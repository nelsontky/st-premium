    <p>Two peo­ple tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, of the 876 stall­hold­ers in and around Tekka Cen­tre who went for community sur­veil­lance test­ing last Thurs­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>Both the cases picked up from sur­veil­lance test­ing are likely to be past in­fec­tions, as in­di­cated by their sero­log­i­cal test re­sults, it said yes­ter­day. The re­main­ing 874 in­di­vid­u­als tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond of the two pa­tients was an­nounced yes­ter­day. The 41-year-old In­dian na­tional is a work per­mit holder who works as a ware­house as­sis­tant. He was asymp­to­matic, and taken to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases when his test came back pos­i­tive on Fri­day. The other pos­i­tive case, an­nounced by MOH on Satur­day, is a Sin­ga­porean woman who sells mut­ton with a co-worker at a stall in Tekka Mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond pa­tient’s work in­volves stock­tak­ing at ware­houses in Cuff Road, and de­liv­er­ing goods to Jothi Store and Flower Shop in 1 Camp­bell Lane, said MOH, which added that he does not in­ter­act with cus­tomers. MOH said he usu­ally works with a ware­house as­sis­tant at the ware­houses. The as­sis­tant was swabbed last Thurs­day and tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Two other mi­grant work­ers who live with the man in Cuff Road also tested neg­a­tive, it added.</p>
    <p>Seven im­ported cases were also an­nounced yes­ter­day, bring­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,213.</p>
    <p>One is a long-term visit pass holder who ar­rived from Rus­sia, while an­other is a stu­dent pass holder who ar­rived from In­dia. An­other three are work per­mit hold­ers who ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing cases are short-term visit pass hold­ers. One is a 39-year-old Ivory Coast na­tional who ar­rived from Malta on a work project. The other short­term pass holder is a 58-year-old male Be­larus na­tional, who came to par­tic­i­pate in a mixed mar­tial arts sport­ing event as a cor­ner­man.</p>
    <p>MOH said all seven had been placed on stay-home no­tices or were iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were tested while in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>There were no cases from within dor­mi­to­ries an­nounced yes­ter­day – the 19th con­sec­u­tive day.</p>
    <p>MOH said there were three un­linked cases in the community in the past week.</p>
    <p>With five cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,109 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
