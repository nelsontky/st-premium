    <p>BER­LIN • A naked sun­bather unashamedl­y gave chase in his birthday suit af­ter a wild boar stole his lap­top while he was re­lax­ing by a Ber­lin lake, in an es­capade that has gone vi­ral.</p>
    <p>The man was pic­tured run­ning af­ter the cheeky swine at Teufelssee lake, a pop­u­lar spot for nude sun­bathing, on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Adele Lan­dauer, a Ber­lin­based life coach who took the pic­tures that went vi­ral, shared them on her In­sta­gram ac­count on Fri­day, de­scrib­ing the man as a “real hero”.</p>
    <p>“A fe­male wild boar with two ba­bies came out of the for­est in or­der to search for food,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>“Many of us were scared but the wild boars seemed to be peace­ful. Af­ter they ate a pizza from a back­pack of a man who was tak­ing a swim in the lake, they were look­ing for a dessert. They found this yel­low bag and de­cided to take it away.”</p>
    <p>The owner of the bag im­me­di­ately leapt up in pur­suit, since the bag had his lap­top in­side.</p>
    <p>“Every one of us adored him, how fo­cused he stayed, and when he came back with his yel­low bag in hand, we all clapped and con­grat­u­lated him for his suc­cess,” Ms Lan­dauer wrote.</p>
    <p>“This hap­pens when you’re fo­cused on your goals,” she added.</p>
    <p>She had orig­i­nally pub­lished the pho­tos on a per­sonal so­cial me­dia ac­count on Thurs­day, with her post be­ing shared thou­sands of times.</p>
    <p>The man laughed when she showed him the pho­tos and asked per­mis­sion to share them, she said.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve life has its funny sides and we should share them,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Lan­dauer was shocked by the at­ten­tion her pho­tos have re­ceived.</p>
    <p>“Of course I was to­tally sur­prised – no­body can ex­pect such a strong in­ter­est,” she told Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
