    <p>Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer be­lieves his play­ers are on a high head­ing into to­mor­row’s Pre­mier League clash at Le­ices­ter.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils are through to the League Cup semi-fi­nals af­ter Wed­nes­day’s dra­matic 2-0 win at Ever­ton, and will face ri­vals Manch­ester City for a place in the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>United dom­i­nated for long pe­ri­ods of their quar­ter-fi­nal at Good­i­son Park, but it took un­til the 88th minute be­fore Edin­son Ca­vani broke the dead­lock.</p>
    <p>The former Paris Saint-Ger­main striker’s fourth goal for United since join­ing on a free trans­fer in Oc­to­ber came at the same venue where he opened his ac­count for the club last month.</p>
    <p>An­thony Mar­tial bagged the se­cond goal in stop­page time.</p>
    <p>“Ca­vani’s fin­ish wasn’t bad! He is a qual­ity striker. We know when we de­fend well we have got play­ers to win us the game,” Sol­sk­jaer said. “Win­ning gives en­ergy. The spirit in the camp is good and this will give us a boost go­ing into the Christ­mas pe­riod and for the next game (at Le­ices­ter) on Box­ing Day.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter a rocky pe­riod that raised ques­tions about the Nor­we­gian’s fu­ture fol­low­ing their exit from the Cham­pi­ons League, United have re­cov­ered their equi­lib­rium.</p>
    <p>They are third in the Pre­mier League and have won their last three matches in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer, who won nine ma­jor tro­phies as a player with United, took charge at Old Traf­ford in 2018 and saw his side lose in three semi-fi­nals last term.</p>
    <p>He now has a chance to go one bet­ter this sea­son but City will be a for­mi­da­ble op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>United were beaten by Pep Guardi­ola’s men at the same stage of the com­pe­ti­tion last sea­son and Sol­sk­jaer said: “We are in the semi­fi­nals, so we are one step away.</p>
    <p>“It is the worst game to lose, a semi-fi­nal. We are go­ing to do ev­ery­thing we can to get to that game in a good state.”</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham and se­cond-tier Brent­ford will meet in the other semi-fi­nal, with the matches to be sin­gle leg in the week com­menc­ing Jan 4.</p>
    <p>Harry Maguire and Bruno Fer­nan­des were the only United play­ers to re­tain their places on Wed­nes­day af­ter the 6-2 rout of Leeds at the week­end, with Paul Pogba re­turn­ing to the start­ing line-up.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing his play­ers fresh ahead of the league clash against se­cond-placed Le­ices­ter, who are one point ahead of United (26) hav­ing played a game more, would have been on Sol­sk­jaer’s mind.</p>
    <p>The United boss will also be wary of Jamie Vardy, af­ter Le­ices­ter man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers de­clared the striker fit for the match to­mor­row. The 33-year-old, who has 11 goals in 13 league out­ings this sea­son af­ter scor­ing in last Sun­day’s 2-0 win over Tot­ten­ham,</p>
    <p>was sub­sti­tuted in that game fol­low­ing a hip prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“Vardy will be fine for the game, it’s just a bit of sore­ness,” the Ul­ster­man said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter have lost more games (19) and con­ceded more goals (60) against United than they</p>
    <p>have ver­sus any other side in the Pre­mier League.</p>
    <p>United, mean­while, en­ter the game on the back of a 10-match win­ning run away from home in the league, one short of the record jointly held by Chelsea and City.</p>
