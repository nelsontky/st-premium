    <p>Di­a­monds may be a girl’s best friend, but it seems they can also be one’s down­fall.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-based Bel­la­graph Nova Group (BN Group) re­cently found it­self mak­ing head­lines for all the wrong rea­sons af­ter it made a bid for the New­cas­tle United foot­ball club.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the founders have been called out for us­ing doc­tored images of them­selves with for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama and mak­ing mul­ti­ple un­ver­i­fied claims in their in­ter­views, press re­leases, web­site and so­cial me­dia ac­counts.</p>
    <p>One which raised eye­brows within the lo­cal jew­ellery in­dus­try is the au­da­cious claim by Bel­la­graph Jew­elry of a record-break­ing US$102 mil­lion (S$139 mil­lion) on­line sale. Re­port­edly from founder Evan­ge­line Shen’s Red Di­a­mond Jew­elry Col­lec­tion, the piece was said to have been sold to an “un­named male col­lec­tor”.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen did not re­spond to ear­lier re­quests for an in­ter­view</p>
    <p>Lo­cal jewellers and col­lec­tors The Straits Times spoke to were scep­ti­cal about the al­leged sale. Af­ter all, the sum sur­passes some of the most his­toric pub­lic sales of jew­els.</p>
    <p>A check with auction houses and global high jew­ellery au­thor­i­ties Sotheby’s and Christie’s re­vealed that to date, the most ex­pen­sive di­a­mond pub­licly auc­tioned is the 59.6-carat “Pink Star” di­a­mond.</p>
    <p>Sold at a 2017 Sotheby’s auction in Hong Kong for US$71.2 mil­lion, it was ac­quired by renowned Hong Kong jew­eller Chow Tai Fook.</p>
    <p>So is a US$102 mil­lion on­line trans­ac­tion pos­si­ble?</p>
    <p>Caratell’s Michael Koh finds the price “a bit be­yond imag­i­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal jew­eller, who makes reg­u­lar trips to source pre­cious stones, prices his jew­ellery from $5,000 to $10,000 for en­try-level pieces. Pieces from his “rare” col­lec­tion are priced above $15,000.</p>
    <p>The most ex­pen­sive pieces he has sold fetched about US$2 mil­lion each – a 14-carat un­treated Kash­mir blue sap­phire; and a nat­u­ral 10-carat, D-colour, in­ter­nally flaw­less Type IIa Gol­conda di­a­mond. The Type IIa clas­si­fi­ca­tion places it in the top 2 per cent of the world’s di­a­monds.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, he ac­quired a rare 16.41-carat emer­ald, mined in Ethiopia, and cer­ti­fied by the Ge­mo­log­i­cal In­sti­tute of Amer­ica (GIA) as one of the largest, non-en­hanced emer­alds the in­sti­tute had ever cer­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh set the gem into a pen­dant neck­lace with di­a­monds sur­round­ing it.</p>
    <p>“But even then, I don’t sell it at such an ex­or­bi­tant price,” says Mr Koh, who val­ues the fin­ished piece in his col­lec­tion at around half a mil­lion dol­lars. “So a piece worth US$102 mil­lion is a bit hard for me to imag­ine.”</p>
    <p>Ms Si­mone Ng, de­signer and founder of Si­mone Jew­els, be­lieves such a trans­ac­tion, and on­line, is “very un­likely but not im­pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>“A red di­a­mond is in­deed very rare, es­pe­cially in larger sizes if you can get your hands on one,” says the cer­ti­fied gemol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>Her own pieces start from four­digit prices. Her most ex­pen­sive sale was a neck­lace with large gem­stones that sold for a six-digit sum.</p>
    <p>“It de­pends on the buyer’s will­ing­ness to pay and the seller’s will­ing­ness to let it go.”</p>
    <p>How much a piece of jew­ellery can com­mand de­pends on sev­eral fac­tors in­clud­ing prove­nance (for ex­am­ple, if it was once owned by royalty or some­one im­por­tant in his­tory); colour – “only one in 10,000 di­a­monds has a fancy colour”; and size, says Ms Ng.</p>
    <p>Most gem-qual­ity mined di­a­monds fall within a colour range of white to pale yel­low or brown. Di­a­monds with more in­tense hues, which in­clude red, blue and green, are ex­tremely rare and termed “fancy colour” di­a­monds.</p>
    <p>Caratell car­ries a wide range of rare gems in­clud­ing the Bixbite (red beryl) gem­stone.</p>
    <p>“But even though it’s so rare, it doesn’t mean it will com­mand that kind of price,” says Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>Ms An­gela Loh, founder of home­grown jew­ellery and time­piece fes­ti­val JeweLuxe Sin­ga­pore, says a US$102 mil­lion sin­gle sale is “not a com­mon oc­cur­rence”.</p>
    <p>“When look­ing at to­tal jew­ellery sales around the world, there is per­haps 0.01 per cent of such a pos­si­bil­ity,” says Ms Loh, who has more than 20 years of ex­pe­ri­ence in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In 2018, JeweLuxe fetched about $9.7 mil­lion in de­clared sales. The high­est on-site sale the fes­ti­val has ever made cost US$80,000. “Items above this value re­quire ne­go­ti­a­tion for a pe­riod of time af­ter the ex­hi­bi­tion,” she adds.</p>
    <p>“Most jew­ellery and auction houses would an­nounce and pub­li­cise jew­ellery pieces of such value be­ing sold, so not dis­clos­ing specifics of the jew­ellery sold is un­usual. It would be near im­pos­si­ble to sell it purely on­line with­out hu­man in­ter­ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>With a chuckle, Mr Koh es­ti­mates that it would take a “10-carat red di­a­mond, if it ex­ists” to have a price tag of US$102 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“But so far there’s no record of such a piece on the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “There should be a record in all the fa­mous gem labs in the world, be­cause a piece like that would have gone through test­ing to de­ter­mine au­then­tic­ity.</p>
    <p>“We come across a lot of peo­ple mak­ing all sorts of claims in this in­dus­try. But they must have a cer­tifi­cate to back their claims.”</p>
