    <p>•</p>
    <p>Just af­ter 1pm on Wed­nes­day, when United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ended his speech to pro­test­ers in Wash­ing­ton by call­ing for them to march on Congress, hun­dreds of echo­ing calls to storm the build­ing were made by his sup­port­ers on­line.</p>
    <p>On so­cial me­dia sites used by the far right, such as Gab and Par­ler, di­rec­tions on which streets to take to avoid the po­lice and which tools to bring to help prise open doors were ex­changed in com­ments. At least a dozen peo­ple posted about car­ry­ing guns into the halls of Congress.</p>
    <p>Calls for vi­o­lence against mem­bers of Congress and for proTrump move­ments to re­take the Capi­tol build­ing have been cir­cu­lat­ing on­line for months. Bol­stered by Mr Trump, who has courted fringe move­ments such as QAnon and the Proud Boys, groups have openly or­gan­ised on so­cial me­dia net­works and re­cruited oth­ers to their cause.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, their on­line ac­tivism be­came real-world vi­o­lence, lead­ing to un­prece­dented scenes of mobs freely strolling through the halls of Congress and up­load­ing cel­e­bra­tory pho­to­graphs of them­selves, en­cour­ag­ing oth­ers to join them.</p>
    <p>The crowds had been told by their leader – Mr Trump – that the votes against him had been rigged, and told to march on the US Capi­tol to “stand strong for the in­tegrity of our elec­tions” and to “save our democ­racy”, re­ported The Guardian.</p>
    <p>He en­cour­aged his sup­port­ers to head to Wash­ing­ton to fight Congress’ for­mal ap­proval of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s win.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump told them to con­verge on Congress “peace­fully and pa­tri­ot­i­cally”, but order broke down just min­utes af­ter.</p>
    <p>The mob, in Make Amer­ica Great Again caps, rushed up the Capi­tol steps, forc­ing the po­lice to with­draw, fir­ing flash­bang non-lethal grenades and paint­balls from higher bal­conies in an ef­fort to keep them at bay.</p>
    <p>At 2.24pm, af­ter Mr Trump tweeted that Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done”, dozens of mes­sages on Gab called for those inside the Capi­tol build­ing to hunt down the Vice-Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In videos up­loaded to the chan­nel, pro­test­ers could be heard chant­ing “Where is Pence?”, re­ported The New York Times.</p>
    <p>Ms R e n e e D i R e s t a , a r e - searcher at the Stan­ford In­ter­net Ob­ser­va­tory who stud­ies on­line move­ments, said the vi­o­lence on Wed­nes­day was the re­sult of on­line move­ments op­er­at­ing in closed so­cial me­dia net­works where peo­ple be­lieved the claims of voter fraud and of the elec­tion be­ing stolen from Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese peo­ple are act­ing be­cause they are con­vinced an electi on was stolen,” Ms DiResta said. “This is a demon­stra­tion of the very real-world im­pact of echo cham­bers.”</p>
    <p>She added: “This has been a strik­ing re­pu­di­a­tion of the idea that there is an on­line and an off­line world, and that what is said on­line is in some way kept on­line.”</p>
    <p>Po­lice said pipe bombs were re­cov­ered out­side the of­fices of the Demo­cratic Na­tional Com­mit­tee and the Repub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee. A cooler from a ve­hi­cle on the Capi­tol grounds that con­tained Molo­tov cock­tails was also found.</p>
