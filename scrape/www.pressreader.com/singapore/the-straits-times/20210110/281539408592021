    <p>GENEVA • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has called on wealthy na­tions not to hog all the avail­able Covid-19 vac­cines as the world bat­tles to stem the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus urged rich coun­tries to stop cut­ting their own deals with man­u­fac­tur­ers to snap up the first wave of vac­cines, which could re­sult in a price hike for oth­ers.</p>
    <p>He said that 42 coun­tries had started rolling out their Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes, of which 36 were high-in­come na­tions and six were mid­dle-in­come.</p>
    <p>Low and most mid­dle-in­come coun­tries have not re­ceived any vac­cines yet.</p>
    <p>“No coun­try is ex­cep­tional and should cut the queue and vac­ci­nate all their pop­u­la­tion, while some re­main with no sup­ply,” Dr Te­dros said, push­ing wealth­ier coun­tries to free up ex­cess doses for the glob­ally shared Co­vax pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>GENEVA • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has urged rich coun­tries to stop jump­ing the queue and mak­ing bi­lat­eral deals for the first wave of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said that right from the out­set, wealth­ier na­tions had snapped up the ma­jor­ity of the sup­ply of mul­ti­ple vac­cines – po­ten­tially bump­ing up the price for ev­ery­one else bat­tling the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He called on states that have booked ex­cess vac­cine doses to re­lease them and do­nate them to the glob­ally shared Co­vax pro­gramme, which aims to dis­trib­ute vac­cines eq­ui­tably around the world.</p>
    <p>“I urge coun­tries that have con­tracted more vac­cines than they will need, and are con­trol­ling the global sup­ply, to also do­nate and re­lease them to Co­vax im­me­di­ately, which is ready to­day to roll out quickly,” Dr Te­dros told a press con­fer­ence in Geneva on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“And I urge coun­tries and man­u­fac­tur­ers to stop mak­ing bi­lat­eral deals at the ex­pense of Co­vax.”</p>
    <p>No coun­try was ex­cep­tional and should cut the queue and vac­ci­nate all of its pop­u­la­tion while some re­main with no sup­ply of the vac­cine, he said.</p>
    <p>“Science has de­liv­ered; let’s not waste the op­por­tu­nity to pro­tect lives of those most at risk and en­sure all economies have a fair shot at re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said that 42 coun­tries had started rolling out their Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes. He said 36 of them were high-in­come na­tions and six were mid­dle-in­come.</p>
    <p>“There’s a clear prob­lem that low- and most mid­dle-in­come coun­tries are not re­ceiv­ing the vac­cine yet.</p>
    <p>“At the out­set, rich coun­tries have bought up the ma­jor­ity of the sup­ply of mul­ti­ple vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>Co­vax, the glob­ally pooled vac­cine pro­cure­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion ef­fort, has struck agree­ments for two bil­lion vac­cine doses.</p>
    <p>Co­vax aims to se­cure vac­cines for 20 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion in each par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­try by the end of the year, with fund­ing cov­ered for the 92 lower- and lower-mid­dle in­come economies in­volved in the scheme.</p>
    <p>It is co-led by the WHO, the Gavi vac­cine al­liance and the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions.</p>
