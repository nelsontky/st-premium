    <p>If you like to help peo­ple run er­rands or babysit, you will prob­a­bly never be out of work in China. In­deed, those who like to pro­vide such ser­vices will prob­a­bly be able to find a job that is near their home too.</p>
    <p>Surg­ing de­mand for but­ler-like concierge ser­vices at the mil­lions of con­do­mini­ums in China is cre­at­ing one of the hottest sec­tors in the na­tion’s stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty man­age­ment com­pa­nies – pro­vid­ing ev­ery­thing from child­care to shop­ping er­rands for res­i­dents in China’s densely pop­u­lated com­mu­ni­ties – have soared this year as the pan­demic kept work­ers at home.</p>
    <p>Ever Sun­shine Lifestyle Ser­vices Group, spun off from Cifi Hold­ings Group, has tripled in value this year.</p>
    <p>Yincheng Life Ser­vice has surged more than 400 per cent, while Times Neigh­bour­hood Hold­ings has more than dou­bled.</p>
    <p>Over­all, hous­ing ser­vice stocks in Hong Kong have jumped 60 per cent on av­er­age, top­ping the 47 per cent rise by Chi­nese con­sumer stocks in Shanghai and the 29 per cent gain for tech­nol­ogy firms.</p>
    <p>“The sec­tor has be­come highly favoured by in­vestors, al­most like they’re con­sumer or tech stocks,” said CGS-CIMB Se­cu­ri­ties prop­erty an­a­lyst Ray­mond Cheng. “We have seen global funds from Sin­ga­pore to the United States pil­ing onto it.”</p>
    <p>China’s highly in­debted prop­erty de­vel­op­ers are tak­ing note, seiz­ing on the rally to list their ser­vice arms in Hong Kong and raise money to pare debt. Thir­teen Chi­nese de­vel­op­ers have started or flagged in­ten­tions to spin off their man­age­ment units this year, a record since 2017 when the trend emerged.</p>
    <p>A dense neigh­bour­hood in China can have as many as 100,000 con­do­mini­ums, cre­at­ing a cap­tive mar­ket for ver­sa­tile ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents – es­pe­cially the el­derly and those with young chil­dren – are in­creas­ingly us­ing th­ese but­lers to buy gro­ceries and medicine, rent out their in­vest­ment prop­er­ties, or even babysit their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>While list­ings picked up about two years ago when the prop­erty arm of Coun­try Gar­den Hold­ings, China’s largest res­i­den­tial builder, started trad­ing in Hong Kong, the ma­jor val­u­a­tion boost has come this year.</p>
    <p>Spin­ning off prop­erty man­age­ment units gives de­vel­op­ers much needed fund­ing, es­pe­cially as they face the big­gest liq­uid­ity test in more than four years.</p>
    <p>China Ever­grande Group – the na­tion’s most lever­aged ma­jor de­vel­oper – and Sunac China Hold­ings last month joined smaller ri­vals in an­nounc­ing list­ing plans.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande’s ad­di­tion of strate­gic in­vestors into its pri­vately held ser­vice unit, a move widely seen as a pre-list­ing move, has helped the de­vel­oper lower its net debt to eq­uity by 19 per­cent­age points, the com­pany’s pres­i­dent Xia Hai­jun said on an earn­ings call last month.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence prop­erty an­a­lyst Kristy Hung said: “For de­vel­op­ers, both their fi­nan­cial pres­sure and splen­did val­u­a­tions of ser­vice firms lure them to the wave of IPOs (ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings).”</p>
    <p>She added: “For those debt-laden builders, hav­ing one more listed en­tity means more ver­sa­tile fund-rais­ing chan­nels.”</p>
    <p>Un­like de­vel­op­ers that face un­cer­tain­ties from a cycli­cal slow­down and gov­ern­ment re­stric­tions, the prop­erty man­age­ment busi­ness is shielded from China’s prop­erty curbs. Its advantages in­clude a sta­ble model with re­cur­ring fee rev­enue and low lever­age.</p>
    <p>In­vestors also like the growth out­look, as sprawl­ing new apart­ments built by their par­ent de­vel­op­ers trans­late into new busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The big­ger play­ers are also on a fast ex­pan­sion track by swal­low­ing smaller ri­vals.</p>
    <p>“It’s an at­trac­tive, long-term in­vest­ment op­por­tu­nity that ex­ists only in China,” said CGS-CIMB’s Mr Cheng, who es­ti­mates the in­dus­try’s mar­ket value will quadru­ple to US$180 bil­lion (S$248 bil­lion) by 2025. “No other coun­try has so much floor area to man­age.”</p>
    <p>Still, the stock surge has pushed val­u­a­tions well above the prop­erty par­ents, rais­ing con­cerns about stretched prices.</p>
    <p>At least 10 com­pa­nies trade at more than 47 times trail­ing 12-month earn­ings, in line with spir­its maker Kwe­i­chow Moutai, one of China’s most loved stocks.</p>
    <p>“The sec­tor’s share prices may come un­der pres­sure in the next two to three months,” China In­ter­na­tional Cap­i­tal Corp an­a­lyst Eric Zhang wrote in a re­port. “The slew of up­com­ing IPOs will likely di­lute in­vestors’ funds. As earn­ings sea­son passes, there isn’t much cat­a­lyst left in the short term.”</p>
