    <p>Sin­ga­pore shares re­treated yes­ter­day fol­low­ing dis­ap­point­ing in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion fig­ures that ex­ac­er­bated wor­ries about the coun­try’s eco­nomic weak­ness.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) fell 32.84 points, or 1.26 per cent, to 2,579.51.</p>
    <p>Losers out­num­bered gain­ers 336 to 132, with 1.2 bil­lion shares worth $1.31 bil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion was down 6.7 per cent year on year, fall­ing short of the 2.6 per cent over­all con­trac­tion fore­cast by pri­vate sec­tor econ­o­mists in a Bloomberg poll. They said this back­drop sug­gests risks to sec­ond-quar­ter gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP).</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank econ­o­mist Howie Lee said that while full-year GDP growth is still ex­pected to fall be­tween mi­nus 6 per cent and mi­nus 5 per cent, risks are ex­pected to be “firmly tilted to the down­side”.</p>
    <p>This comes on the back of es­ca­lat­ing United States-China ten­sions and po­ten­tial damp­en­ing of sen­ti­ment if “cur­rent fis­cal mea­sures ex­pire with­out an ad­e­quate re­newal of sup­port”, he said.</p>
    <p>Among the STI con­stituents, Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust, As­cen­das Reit and Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust again emerged as the top-per­form­ing coun­ters for the day.</p>
    <p>Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust rose 1.9 per cent to $3.16, As­cen­das Reit gained 1.5 per cent to $3.48, while Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust closed up 0.5 per cent to $2.14.</p>
    <p>As­cen­das Reit was also among the most ac­tive on the blue-chip in­dex fol­low­ing re­ports that an­a­lysts have in­creased their tar­get prices for units of the Reit. About 22 mil­lion units changed hands.</p>
    <p>They noted that its di­ver­si­fied port­fo­lio and po­ten­tial ac­cre­tive ac­qui­si­tions are likely to help off­set the un­cer­tain out­look.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Cor­po­ra­tion was at the bot­tom of the ta­ble, fall­ing 4 per cent to $5.71 af­ter warn­ing yes­ter­day that it will recog­nise ma­te­rial im­pair­ments in its re­sults for the sec­ond quar­ter, mainly from the off­shore and ma­rine busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The most heav­ily traded counter for the day was Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore, which lost 0.7 per cent to end at 75 cents af­ter more than 35 mil­lion shares changed hands.</p>
    <p>The STI’s per­for­mance was in line with re­gional mar­kets, which ended lower amid in­ten­si­fy­ing USChina ten­sions and dis­ap­point­ing job­less claims data in the US.</p>
    <p>Re­gional bourses mostly closed out the week with losses.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng In­dex tum­bled 2.21 per cent, while Shanghai shares dived 3.86 per cent amid the big­gest threat to diplo­matic ties with the US in years.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi dipped 0.71 per cent, while Aus­tralian shares fell 1.16 per cent.</p>
