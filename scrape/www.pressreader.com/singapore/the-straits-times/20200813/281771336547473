    <p>MADRID • Just seven weeks af­ter bring­ing its first coro­n­avirus wave un­der con­trol, ex­perts say Spain is once again in a “crit­i­cal” sit­u­a­tion, with the worst in­fec­tion rate in West­ern Europe.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported an av­er­age of 4,923 new daily cases of Covid-19 dur­ing the last seven days, a higher num­ber than that of Bri­tain, France, Ger­many and Italy com­bined, ac­cord­ing to a tally com­piled by Agence France-Presse based on of­fi­cial fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Spain has 95 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 peo­ple, com­pared with 24 in France, 17 in Bri­tain, 13 in Ger­many and just eight in Italy.</p>
    <p>The spike has led a grow­ing list of coun­tries to im­pose re­stric­tions on travel to Spain, which has nearly 323,000 con­firmed cases of the dis­ease, the high­est num­ber in West­ern Europe and the 11th-high­est in the world.</p>
    <p>Dr Sal­vador Macip, an ex­pert in health sci­ences at Cat­alo­nia’s Open Univer­sity, said: “It’s a crit­i­cal mo­ment, we are right at a point where things can get bet­ter or worse.</p>
    <p>“This means we have to pull out all the stops to curb out­breaks be­fore they be­come more se­ri­ous.”</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently more than 500 out­break clus­ters in Spain, ac­cord­ing to the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­nando Si­mon, the min­istry’s emer­gen­cies co­or­di­na­tor, ac­knowl­edged on Mon­day that there are cases of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in some places that are “not per­fectly con­trolled”, but he said they had “grad­u­ally sub­sided” in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>In mid-March, Spain im­posed one of the strictest lock­downs in Europe, with peo­ple al­lowed out­side only to buy food, seek med­i­cal care, briefly walk their pets or go to work if they could not do so re­motely.</p>
    <p>When the lock­down mea­sures were com­pletely lifted on June 21, the coun­try re­ported just 238 new in­fec­tions and it had just eight cases per 100,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But in­fec­tions have surged since the first week of last month, in part be­cause the govern­ment “rushed” to open the econ­omy “surely think­ing about tourism”, a pil­lar of the Span­ish econ­omy, said Dr Joan Cayla, the head of Barcelona’s tu­ber­cu­lo­sis in­ves­ti­ga­tion unit, which now fo­cuses on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dr Macip added that sev­eral out­break clus­ters have been re­ported among sea­sonal farm work­ers – who of­ten live in cramped con­di­tions – since the sum­mer harvest sea­son be­gan, help­ing to fuel the rise in cases.</p>
    <p>The start of warm weather has also led peo­ple to re­lax a bit, in a coun­try where phys­i­cal con­tact and get-to­geth­ers with friends and fam­ily are com­mon, he said.</p>
    <p>This helped cre­ate a “per­fect storm”, Dr Macip added.</p>
    <p>Spain recorded 950 Covid-19 deaths on April 2 alone when its first coro­n­avirus wave peaked – com­pared with a to­tal of 253 deaths since lock­down mea­sures ended on June 21, for a to­tal of 28,576 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
