    <p>Man­dopop star JJ Lin (be­low) has deep­ened his e-sports foray and made a splash in the local gam­ing scene by launch­ing an all-Sin­ga­porean e-sports team. The team, set up to com­pete in the first-per­son shooter game Valo­rant, is part of Team Still Mov­ing Un­der Gun­fire, an e-sports or­gan­i­sa­tion formed in 2017 by Lin and e-sports player turned coach Kenchi Yap.</p>
    <p>Man­dopop megas­tar JJ Lin is pop­u­lar for his hit bal­lads, but that is not his only pas­sion. The Singapore singer and avid gamer is also one of the own­ers of an e-sports or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, he deep­ened his es­ports foray and made a splash in the local gam­ing scene by launch­ing an all-Sin­ga­porean e-sports team.</p>
    <p>The team, set up to com­pete in the first-per­son shooter (FPS) game Valo­rant, is part of Team Still Mov­ing Un­der Gun­fire (SMG), an es­ports or­gan­i­sa­tion formed in 2017 by Lin and e-sports player-turned­coach Kenchi Yap.</p>
    <p>“Team SMG has teams in Shang­hai, Malaysia and, fi­nally, Singapore,” says Lin, who is a mem­ber of the Singapore E-sports As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, he ac­quired Malaysian Mo­bile Leg­ends team Makan Cen­dol to add to his squad in Shang­hai, which com­petes in the game PlayerUn­k­nown’s Bat­tle­grounds, a pop­u­lar on­line mul­ti­player bat­tle royale shooter game said to have sold more than 70 mil­lion copies.</p>
    <p>On his first all-Sin­ga­porean es­ports team, Lin says: “This is a mile­stone in my e-sports jour­ney, one that is very close to my heart.”</p>
    <p>He says he started gam­ing at a young age and the pas­time has evolved into one of his pas­sions.</p>
    <p>He tells The Straits Times: “Born and raised in this lit­tle red dot that is Singapore, it’s been my dream to not only build my busi­nesses and brands here, but also far­ther be­yond.</p>
    <p>“As a Sin­ga­porean, I nat­u­rally want to nur­ture a home-grown team and inch them to­wards the global plat­form. I as­pire to in­stil pos­i­tive val­ues in them while striv­ing to achieve suc­cess in an ev­er­grow­ing e-sports in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>The all-Sin­ga­porean ros­ter com­prises play­ers Sha Mo­htar, Danyal Heng, Alex Cheang, Xavier Lee, Yeoh Chun Ting and Syafiq Anuar – all veter­ans who have played pro­fes­sion­ally in the FPS game Counter-Strike: Global Of­fen­sive and come out tops in sev­eral re­gional com­pe­ti­tions. They will be man­aged by coach Ken­neth Ho.</p>
    <p>Launched last month, Valo­rant is one of the most pop­u­lar new games on the scene, with nearly three mil­lion gamers play­ing it daily dur­ing its two-month beta test­ing pe­riod prior to launch.</p>
    <p>Sha, captain of Team SMG Valo­rant, says: “We were ex­cited when Team SMG ap­proached us af­ter we won the first two Valo­rant com­mu­nity tour­na­ments in Singapore. With Team SMG, we feel con­fi­dent rep­re­sent­ing an or­gan­i­sa­tion that will sup­port us and al­low us to suc­ceed.”</p>
    <p>The team will make its com­pet­i­tive de­but this month at the Rise of Le­gion: Valo­rant tour­na­ment against other teams from South­east Asia. The vir­tual event starts next Mon­day and ends on July 31.</p>
