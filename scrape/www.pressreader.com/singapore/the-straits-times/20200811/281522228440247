    <p>Going to the beach is al­most a rit­ual for many peo­ple dur­ing long week­ends in Sin­ga­pore. Yes­ter­day was no dif­fer­ent – al­most. The Na­tional Day long week­end saw crowds pic­nick­ing and soak­ing in the sun (right). But vis­i­tors faced crowd con­trol mea­sures. Since early last month, the more pop­u­lar beach­fronts at East Coast Park (above) have been seg­mented, with ca­pac­ity lim­its and SafeEn­try check-in at the en­trances for con­tact-trac­ing pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses on both sides of the Cause­way wel­comed the cross­bor­der travel ar­range­ments be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, which will al­low em­ploy­ers to travel for es­sen­tial meet­ings and af­ford work­ers op­por­tu­ni­ties to see their fam­i­lies more of­ten.</p>
    <p>The ar­range­ments will ad­dress the press­ing travel needs of both coun­tries, the Malaysia-Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Coun­cil said in a joint state­ment with the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion. Ap­pli­ca­tions for the</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia travel ar­range­ments opened yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil, which pro­motes busi­ness and in­vest­ment ac­tiv­i­ties be­tween both coun­tries, met vir­tu­ally last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Its Sin­ga­pore co-chair­man Robert Yap said: “Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses wel­come the bi­lat­eral cross­bor­der travel ar­range­ments as they al­low us to travel to Malaysia for im­por­tant meet­ings, and our em­ploy­ees can travel more eas­ily be­tween Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore to see their fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the coun­cil will of­fer feed­back to the re­spec­tive gov­ern­ments on how the ar­range­ments can be im­proved to bet­ter serve the needs of busi­nesses and em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, more than 300,000 trav­ellers used the Cause­way ev­ery day. Among these were about 100,000 Malaysians who com­muted daily be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der travel be­tween both sides will take place un­der two schemes: The re­cip­ro­cal green lane for trav­ellers on shorter visits, and the longer-term pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>The re­cip­ro­cal green lane fa­cil­i­tates travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness or of­fi­cial pur­poses be­tween both sides for up to 14 days.</p>
    <p>The pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment al­lows Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia res­i­dents who hold longterm passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try to en­ter that coun­try for work. They have to re­main in the desti­na­tion coun­try for at least 90 days be­fore re­turn­ing for home leave, and trav­ellers un­der this ar­range­ment can en­ter or exit only via the two land check­points – at Wood­lands or Tuas.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia busi­ness ties are sig­nif­i­cant for the re­gion, said the coun­cil’s Malaysian co-chair­man Nik Norzrul Thani, adding that both sides have agreed to plan for a se­ries of we­bi­nars for the busi­ness com­mu­ni­ties to ex­change ideas on the digital econ­omy and start-ups.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the meet­ing, the coun­cil dis­cussed plans for a fo­cus group to col­lab­o­rate on var­i­ous ar­eas, such as digital con­nec­tiv­ity, fin­tech and e-com­merce, in a bid to tap the fast growth of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and the digital econ­omy.</p>
    <p>It also agreed to set up an­other fo­cus group on the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of man­u­fac­tur­ing ser­vices as well as the adop­tion of In­dus­try 4.0 so­lu­tions such as ro­bot­ics to strengthen each other’s man­u­fac­tur­ing sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers also touched on ini­tia­tives such as the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore high-speed rail project. The coun­cil high­lighted that the pri­vate sec­tor from both coun­tries is keen to find out how it could be in­volved in the new plans for the project.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil also ex­pressed its con­fi­dence that the two economies will bounce back to pre-Covid-19 lev­els fol­low­ing the eas­ing of mea­sures in both coun­tries and the avail­abil­ity of a vaccine.</p>
    <p>Dr Yap said it is promis­ing to see busi­nesses on both sides ex­plor­ing col­lab­o­ra­tion on the var­i­ous fronts. “This cri­sis has of­fered very good op­por­tu­ni­ties for en­ter­prises to think of how to trans­form their busi­ness mod­els and de­velop new strate­gies to po­si­tion them­selves for a post­Covid new nor­mal en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
