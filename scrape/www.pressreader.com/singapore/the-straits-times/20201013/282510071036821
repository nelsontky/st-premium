    <p>This year’s vOi­lah! France Sin­ga­pore Fes­ti­val cel­e­brates the con­nec­tions be­tween the two coun­tries with an ex­hi­bi­tion com­mem­o­rat­ing the 100th an­niver­sary of for­mer French premier Ge­orges Cle­menceau’s vis­its to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Cle­menceau In Sin­ga­pore will also ex­plore the so­cial life of Sin­ga­pore. Cle­menceau stopped over in Sin­ga­pore twice as part of his 1920 Asian tour, dur­ing which he of­fi­ci­ated the ground-break­ing cer­e­mony of the con­struc­tion of Cle­menceau Av­enue on Oct 22 and wit­nessed the lay­ing of the foun­da­tion stone of the Ceno­taph on Nov 15.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion, pre­sented in part­ner­ship with Paris’ Musee Cle­menceau, will take place at the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore from Oct 23 to Nov 22. There will also be a we­bi­nar ex­plor­ing the sim­i­lar­i­ties be­tween Cle­menceau and Dr Lim Boon Keng, a physi­cian who pro­moted so­cial and ed­u­ca­tional re­forms in Sin­ga­pore in the early 20th-cen­tury. Both were po­lit­i­cal ac­tivists with pro­gres­sive views about modernisin­g their so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>France’s am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Marc Aben­sour de­scribes Cle­menceau, cel­e­brated for lead­ing France to vic­tory in World War I, as “the em­bod­i­ment of re­silience”. He says: “There is a won­der­ful story to be told about his visit to Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Re­silience is one of three mes­sages the fes­ti­val hopes to con­vey, the oth­ers be­ing op­por­tu­nity in cri­sis and the long­stand­ing friend­ship be­tween France and Sin­ga­pore, he adds.</p>
    <p>Cle­menceau was also a play­wright and there will be a drama­tised read­ing of his play, The Veil Of Hap­pi­ness. The read­ing, fea­tur­ing ac­tors Jan­ice Koh and Hos­san Leong, will be streamed on the fes­ti­val’s Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Like other events held dur­ing the pan­demic, the fes­ti­val, which runs from Oct 22 to Nov 22, will con­duct 60 per cent of its line-up of al­most 50 pro­grammes on­line.</p>
    <p>But the re­stric­tions have not damp­ened en­thu­si­asm for the fes­ti­val, which drew 110 Sin­ga­porean and French part­ners, the most num­ber since it be­gan in 2007.</p>
    <p>There will be vir­tual mu­sic col­lab­o­ra­tions in­clud­ing the fes­ti­val’s grand fi­nale fea­tur­ing the Orchestre Na­tional d’Ile-de-France (Na­tional Orches­tra of Paris Re­gion), con­ducted by Sin­ga­porean Wong Kah Chun. The orches­tra will play a pro­gramme of French com­posers in­clud­ing Claude De­bussy and Ce­sar Franck with Sin­ga­porean mu­si­cians us­ing tech­nol­ogy by French clas­si­cal mu­sic start-up, No­madPlay.</p>
    <p>Film fans can ex­pect 28 films on of­fer on­line for the French Film Fes­ti­val from Nov 6 to 22, some of which have yet to de­but in France.</p>
    <p>For real-life en­gage­ment, head to Gar­dens by the Bay for an eye-pop­ping vir­tual-re­al­ity ex­pe­ri­ence, A Vir­tual Voyage Through Mas­ter­pieces. You can walk into art­works such as Claude Monet’s famed water lilies as well as mas­ter­works by other painters such as Paul Gau­guin and Edouard Manet.</p>
    <p>Plant lovers should also look out for the Gar­dens, Plants And Spices ex­hi­bi­tion at the Botanic Gar­dens from Nov 21 to Jan 10. Cre­ated in col­lab­o­ra­tion with famed French gar­den de­signer Pas­cal Garbe, this dis­play ex­plores the links be­tween trop­i­cal spices and French art de vivre. Three Miche­lin-starred chef Anne-So­phie Pic will join Garbe and art his­to­rian Paul Par­adis on a dig­i­tal panel dis­cussing these con­nec­tions on Nov 21.</p>
    <p>French cui­sine is also high­lighted in the fes­ti­val. Tiong Bahru Bak­ery is pre­sent­ing a French twist on a lo­cal breakfast – a kaya crois­sant – for a lim­ited pe­riod. Three Miche­lin-starred French restau­rant Odette’s chef Julien Royer has cre­ated a Le Paris-Brest-Sin­gapour, which in­cor­po­rates lo­cal flavours of gula me­laka, co­conut and a rich kaya cream into the clas­sic French dessert. Avid bak­ers who want to learn the se­crets of these cre­ations can at­tend on­line classes.</p>
    <p>Other food events in­clude a gar­den food tour and work­shop by Open Farm Com­mu­nity as well as classes by Sin­ga­porean som­me­lier Ger­ald Lu and chef Justin Quek.</p>
