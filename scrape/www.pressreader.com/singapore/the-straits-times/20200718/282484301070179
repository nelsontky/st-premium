    <p>• Fer­rari driv­ers Se­bas­tian Vet­tel and Charles Le­clerc have put their first-round col­li­sion at the Steier­mark Grand Prix last Sun­day be­hind them, but nei­ther is filled with much op­ti­mism for the im­me­di­ate fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The Scud­e­ria, run­ners-up to Mer­cedes in last year’s For­mula One con­struc­tors’ ta­ble, are fifth over­all af­ter the first two races of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Le­clerc was a for­tu­nate sec­ond in the Aus­trian opener, de­spite the car lack­ing straight-line speed, but the pair’s ac­ci­dent in the sec­ond race ended their in­volve­ment on the same Red Bull Ring cir­cuit from the get-go.</p>
    <p>Ahead of to­mor­row’s Hun­gar­ian Grand Prix, Le­clerc said the pair had made up, with Fer­rari fac­ing more press­ing con­cerns over their lack of speed.</p>
    <p>“We’ve put it be­hind us,” the Mone­gasque said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“I di­rectly went to talk to Seb af­ter the race to ex­cuse my­self. I think he ac­cepted that.</p>
    <p>Kane has fond mem­o­ries of Le­ices­ter. A four-goal haul against them in 2017 helped him win the Golden Boot and, af­ter reach­ing 200 club ca­reer goals this week, he is in form. Now he has the chance to prey on an un­der­study. Ben­nett, bor­rowed from Wolves in Jan­uary, re­placed the sus­pended Caglar Soyuncu in a new-look back three on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Tielemans’ su­perb early-sea­son form in­vited ques­tions why clubs such as Manch­ester United did not buy him last sum­mer. The Bel­gian has re­lapsed since then but, with James Mad­di­son strug­gling with in­jury, his creativity could be cru­cial. Spurs lack the kind of high-class de­fen­sive mid­fielder Jose Mour­inho likes, so the passer Winks must com­pen­sate.</p>
    <p>Alder­weireld is on a high af­ter last week’s win­ner against Ar­se­nal. Ini­tially omit­ted from the sum­mer games, he has strength­ened Spurs’ de­fence since be­ing re­called. Yet his weak­ness nowa­days is against the pace Vardy, be­ly­ing his age, possesses. Spurs man­ager Mour­inho will prob­a­bly de­fend deep to try and pre­vent him from hav­ing room to run into.</p>
    <p>“On my side, I will fo­cus on this week­end and try­ing to achieve the best re­sult pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Vet­tel added the in­ci­dent was just part and par­cel of rac­ing and the fo­cus was now on do­ing the best they can at Hun­garor­ing.</p>
    <p>“These things are the worst that can hap­pen, ob­vi­ously if two cars of the same colour come together, it’s some­thing we al­ways try to avoid,” the Ger­man said.</p>
    <p>“But you are rac­ing and this</p>
    <p>Harry Kane v Ryan Ben­nett Harry Winks v Youri Tielemans Toby Alder­weireld v Jamie Vardy</p>
    <p>stuff un­for­tu­nately was part of it. We spoke about it, it’s be­hind us and a cou­ple of days later, we have a chance to do bet­ter here in Hun­gary.”</p>
    <p>Due to the ac­ci­dent, Fer­rari never got to test their up­grades fully, which the Ital­ian team have rushed out for their SF1000 cars in light of the is­sues seen in the first two races.</p>
    <p>But Le­clerc has ad­mit­ted their woes will not go away overnight.</p>
    <p>Asked whether Fer­rari had slipped out of the lead pack and into the mid­dle, he ac­cepted that for the time be­ing, the sport’s old­est and most suc­cess­ful team were not ready to win ei­ther their first con­struc­tors’ ti­tle since 2008 or driv­ers’ cham­pi­onship since 2007.</p>
    <p>“Real­is­ti­cally, we are strug­gling with the per­for­mance at the mo­ment so I don’t think we can con­sider us as fight­ing for podi­ums at the mo­ment,” he said. “But we will try to change that.”</p>
    <p>Fer­rari’s wor­ries over their car’s straight-line speed ap­peared well founded yes­ter­day, af­ter Vet­tel and Le­clerc fin­ished sixth and sev­enth re­spec­tively in the first prac­tice ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Six-time world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton, gun­ning for his eighth Hun­gar­ian GP win, and Mer­cedes team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas were dom­i­nant in a one-two fin­ish.</p>
    <p>That led Red Bull boss Chris­tian Horner to ob­serve that the Sil­ver Ar­rows were “look­ing very very, quick”.</p>
