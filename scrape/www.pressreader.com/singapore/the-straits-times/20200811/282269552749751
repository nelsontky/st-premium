    <p>PRAGUE • World No. 2 Si­mona Halep will take the fi­nal de­ci­sion on her par­tic­i­pa­tion in the US Open af­ter play­ing this week’s WTA Tour event in Prague, the Ro­ma­nian said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Top-ranked Ash­leigh Barty has opted against trav­el­ling to New York to play the hard-court Grand Slam amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, mak­ing the 28-year-old the top draw at this year’s event.</p>
    <p>“I need to get a feel­ing, I need to see what changes they (the US Open or­gan­is­ers) are gonna make with trav­el­ling and stuff,” said Halep. “And then I will be able to de­cide, take the fi­nal de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides Barty, the women’s draw has also lost other top-10 play­ers in No. 5 Elina Svi­tolina and sev­en­thranked Kiki Bertens due to their con­cerns about the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The United States has over five mil­lion cases of Covid-19 and more than 162,000 peo­ple have died.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns re­main whether play­ers would face manda­tory quar­an­tine if they travel to Europe from the US for clay-court events next month.</p>
    <p>The United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion is cre­at­ing a bio-se­cure ‘bub­ble’ with tough pro­to­cols to hold the event from Aug 31 without fans.</p>
    <p>“I know it’s very strict, it’s a lit­tle bit stress­ful in my opin­ion,” said Halep. “But they need those rules for the se­cu­rity, the health is most im­por­tant, they have to take care of ev­ery­one. It’s tough for ev­ery­body to travel these days. But ev­ery­one can take their own de­ci­sion and they know their pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>“My pri­or­ity is my health, the men­tal part and I don’t want to stress my­self for any­thing. My fi­nal de­ci­sion, when I take it, will be based on these.”</p>
    <p>She is the top seed at the Prague Open where she will face Slove­nia’s Polona Hercog in the open­ing round.</p>
    <p>“This break was not easy and we will strug­gle a lit­tle bit to come back,” Halep said, adding that she was happy to have been able to spend some “nor­mal” life at home af­ter the rigours of the Tour for many years.</p>
