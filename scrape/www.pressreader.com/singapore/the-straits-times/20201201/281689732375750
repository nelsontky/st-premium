    <p>Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia has threat­ened to file a defama­tion suit against a par­tic­i­pant who re­ported hav­ing ad­verse re­ac­tions af­ter re­ceiv­ing a dose of the com­pany’s test Covid-19 vac­cine dur­ing a clin­i­cal trial in In­dia.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial at the In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search (ICMR), a co-spon­sor of the vac­cine trial along with Serum In­sti­tute, said the Drug Con­troller-Gen­eral of In­dia (DCGI) is in­ves­ti­gat­ing.</p>
    <p>A 40-year-old trial par­tic­i­pant was ad­mit­ted to a Chen­nai hos­pi­tal for 15 days in Oc­to­ber af­ter ex­pe­ri­enc­ing se­vere neu­ro­log­i­cal re­ac­tions 10 days af­ter re­ceiv­ing a dose of Covishield, as the vac­cine made by the Pune-based Serum In­sti­tute is called.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine tech­nol­ogy was de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity and Bri­tish-based As­traZeneca, and Serum In­sti­tute is con­duct­ing a Phase 2/Phase 3 trial on 1,600 vol­un­teers in In­dia. The pri­vately owned In­dian com­pany is the world’s largest vac­cine man­u­fac­turer.</p>
    <p>Dr S. Ra­makr­ish­nan, the prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor who ad­min­is­tered the vac­cine in Chen­nai on Oct 1, told The Straits Times that the pa­tient was treated from Oct 12 to 26 at the same hos­pi­tal where he re­ceived the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>His con­di­tion was di­ag­nosed af­ter mul­ti­ple tests as acute en­cephalopa­thy, which al­ters brain func­tion and causes per­son­al­ity change, mem­ory loss and de­clin­ing abil­ity to rea­son or con­cen­trate.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient’s wife said the mar­ket­ing con­sul­tant is now re­cov­er­ing at home but suf­fers from weak­ness and mild mood swings.</p>
    <p>Dr Ra­makr­ish­nan said the ill­ness was “un­re­lated to the vac­cine” and that the lo­cal in­sti­tu­tional ethics com­mit­tee agreed with him in its ini­tial as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>But the par­tic­i­pant’s wife charged: “The hos­pi­tal did many tests and bore all the costs, but they were try­ing to find some rea­son for my hus­band’s ill­ness that was not the vac­cine. Even the hos­pi­tal’s dis­charge sum­mary didn’t men­tion the vac­cine un­der med­i­ca­tion his­tory.”</p>
    <p>The dis­charge sum­mary, a copy of which ST has seen, lists ex­ist­ing gas­troen­teric is­sues and a hair­loss tablet the man has taken for a year, but not the trial vac­cine dose he got 10 days prior to fall­ing ill.</p>
    <p>The par­tic­i­pant’s fam­ily filed a le­gal no­tice against the com­pany and In­dia’s drug reg­u­la­tor on Nov 21, de­mand­ing com­pen­sa­tion of 50 mil­lion ru­pees (S$903,800) and that the vac­cine trial be stopped un­til the gov­ern­ment in­ves­ti­ga­tion shows it is safe.</p>
    <p>Serum In­sti­tute on Sun­day dis­missed the par­tic­i­pant’s al­le­ga­tion as “ma­li­cious and mis­con­ceived”. In a state­ment, the com­pany said it would seek dam­ages in ex­cess of a bil­lion ru­pees.</p>
    <p>Dr T. Ja­cob John, a lead­ing vi­rol­o­gist and for­mer pro­fes­sor at the Chris­tian Med­i­cal Col­lege, Vel­lore, said the Serum In­sti­tute’s state­ment was “com­pletely out of line”, es­pe­cially given that the Covishield vac­cine could be given to mil­lions.</p>
    <p>“The com­pany can­not pre­ma­turely de­clare that the ad­verse event is not re­lated to the vac­cine un­til the of­fi­cial agency con­cludes its eval­u­a­tion… The ad­verse event should have been in the pub­lic do­main by mid-Oc­to­ber when the man was hos­pi­talised.”</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca vac­cine tri­als were paused world­wide, in­clud­ing in In­dia, in Septem­ber af­ter two par­tic­i­pants in the trial in Britain suf­fered ad­verse events. The tri­als were re­sumed only af­ter one in­ves­ti­ga­tion con­cluded that the ad­verse event was un­re­lated to the vac­cine, while the other in­ves­ti­ga­tion was in­con­clu­sive.</p>
