    <p>By this time next week, Sin­ga­pore will know if its dreams of hav­ing hawker cul­ture in­scribed on the Unesco in­tan­gi­ble her­itage list have come true.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee in charge of the fi­nal ver­dict is con­ven­ing from to­mor­row to Dec 19, dur­ing which the of­fi­cial re­sult of the nom­i­na­tion will be an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The historic mo­ment has been hotly an­tic­i­pated by the coun­try for nearly three years, though for a while what to nom­i­nate for the list was un­clear.</p>
    <p>Un­like the historic in­scrip­tion of Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens in 2016 as a Unesco World Her­itage Site, pro­mot­ing an in­tan­gi­ble her­itage in­volved mak­ing a de­ci­sion about prac­tices, crafts and rit­u­als, which can be chal­leng­ing in di­verse Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing an item on the list com­mit­ted the Gov­ern­ment to al­lo­cat­ing re­sources to pro­tect it, and to sub­mit­ting a re­port to Unesco ev­ery six years to prove that the nom­i­na­tion was not an empty grab at pres­tige.</p>
    <p>In this con­text, the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB) in 2018 sat down with 140 Sin­ga­pore­ans for ex­ten­sive dis­cus­sions in which they de­lib­er­ated on what to pick. These peo­ple – stu­dents, aca­demics in uni­ver­si­ties, tour guides and per­form­ers in the arts – talked pas­sion­ately about what they would like to see Sin­ga­pore be­ing in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised for.</p>
    <p>NHB’s di­rec­tor of her­itage re­search and as­sess­ment Yeo Kirk Siang said that fun­da­men­tally, the de­bate was about Sin­ga­pore’s iden­tity.</p>
    <p>“We had iden­ti­fied get­ting a nom­i­na­tion as a key rec­om­men­da­tion in Sin­ga­pore’s her­itage plan. Be­cause of how di­verse Sin­ga­pore’s her­itage is, the chal­lenge was to find some­thing that spoke to Sin­ga­pore­ans and that was close to our hearts.”</p>
    <p>“Our work on in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage is about look­ing be­yond our historic build­ings. It is about the cul­tures that de­fine who we are.”</p>
    <p>An in­ven­tory of more than 50 items was cre­ated by the NHB to­gether with Sin­ga­pore­ans. Pro­pos­als in­cluded pil­grim­ages to Kusu Is­land and eth­nic tra­di­tions such as Malay wed­dings and getai per­for­mances. Per­anakan food, as well as how peo­ple cel­e­brate Hari Raya and Chi­nese New Year, were also sug­gested.</p>
    <p>What emerged in the end, how­ever, drove to the heart of a foodie na­tion: Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul Faris, 30, who is now train­ing to be a hawker, said hawker cen­tres have al­ways been a gath­er­ing spot for fam­ily and friends. It also brought all kinds of cuisines and eth­nic­i­ties to­gether. “For hawk­ers, it brings us all un­der one roof with one sole pur­pose – to serve food,” he said. “The same goes for peo­ple. They come here to eat.”</p>
    <p>The NHB said that ul­ti­mately, hawker cul­ture was “con­sis­tently high­lighted” by all they spoke to. Even those in the per­form­ing arts said this was what the NHB should go with.</p>
    <p>With a tar­get and can­di­date ac­quired, the NHB went to work.</p>
    <p>TAK­ING CUES FROM OTHER FOOD CUL­TURES</p>
    <p>There have been other food cul­ture can­di­dates suc­cess­fully nom­i­nated to the Unesco in­tan­gi­ble her­itage list. The “gas­tro­nomic meal of the French” was in 2010 in­scribed as a “cus­tom­ary so­cial prac­tice for cel­e­brat­ing im­por­tant mo­ments in the lives of in­di­vid­u­als and groups”.</p>
    <p>In 2016, beer cul­ture in Bel­gium was said to have a role in Bel­gian daily life. Beer there is used in cook­ing and prod­ucts such as beer-washed cheese.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional Ja­panese food was in 2013 also cho­sen for be­ing as­so­ci­ated with the “es­sen­tial spirit of re­spect for na­ture that is closely re­lated to the sus­tain­able use of nat­u­ral re­sources”.</p>
    <p>While tak­ing ref­er­ence from these, the NHB ob­served that un­like other coun­tries’ more eth­nic­ity-spe­cific it­er­a­tions of food cul­ture, Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture stood out for its mul­ti­cul­tur­al­ism.</p>
    <p>With half the world liv­ing in cities, NHB also wanted to show that city cul­tures are im­por­tant in bring­ing peo­ple to­gether too.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal ti­tle of Sin­ga­pore’s sub­mis­sion – Hawker Cul­ture In Sin­ga­pore: Com­mu­nity Din­ing And Culi­nary Prac­tices In A Mul­ti­cul­tural Ur­ban Con­text – bears this out.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity pres­i­dent Lily Kong, who was in the 14-mem­ber nom­i­na­tion com­mit­tee that over­saw the nom­i­na­tion process, said it is pre­cisely be­cause of ur­ban liv­ing that hawker cul­ture has thrived here.</p>
    <p>“The busy­ness of ev­ery­day ur­ban lives has meant that Sin­ga­pore­ans rely on hawker fare for ev­ery­day meals – con­ve­nient, af­ford­able and fa­mil­iar,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added: “(When) the Gov­ern­ment stopped build­ing hawker cen­tres in the late 2000s and for part of the 2010s, it was based on the think­ing that young peo­ple would pre­fer to eat in other food and bev­er­age op­tions. Clearly, that has not been borne out.”</p>
    <p>A FLURRY OF AC­TIV­ITY</p>
    <p>The months be­tween Au­gust 2018 – when the de­ci­sion to nom­i­nate hawker cul­ture was an­nounced – and the fi­nal sub­mis­sion to Unesco in March last year were hec­tic for the NHB, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency and the Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions, which had by then teamed up to helm the ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Apart from wran­gling over the word­ing of the sub­mis­sion and ex­hor­ta­tions to make de­scrip­tions more colour­ful and evoca­tive of the sights and smells of hawker cen­tres, they also had to cre­ate a 10-minute video and sub­mit 10 pho­tos that best por­trayed hawker cul­ture’s im­por­tance to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of pho­tos were sub­mit­ted in a photo com­pe­ti­tion or­gan­ised to tap com­mu­nity par­tic­i­pa­tion, in­clud­ing more ab­stract de­pic­tions that the NHB de­cided were artis­tic but not as clear in con­vey­ing the mes­sage.</p>
    <p>A video team fanned out to find au­then­tic voices of hawk­ers, which would show­case the hard­ship – and also their pride – in their line, which of­ten en­tails 16-hour work­days.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate team put up pho­tos of hawker cen­tres at Changi Air­port to wel­come tourists, although these ul­ti­mately went un­seen as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic stymied global tourism.</p>
    <p>Tekka Cen­tre hawker Ganesh Singh, who was fea­tured in the video sub­mit­ted to Unesco, said he was slightly flus­tered when he was ap­proached for the film­ing.</p>
    <p>The 54-year-old has been sell­ing teh tarik for more than 30 years and im­me­di­ately recog­nised the sig­nif­i­cance of his par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>“I was not ex­actly shy but it was re­ally im­por­tant,” he said, ex­plain­ing his hes­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“My part took two takes to film prop­erly. It’s just not some­thing that hap­pens ev­ery day and I re­ally en­joyed the process,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo and other rep­re­sen­ta­tives also flew to Colom­bia last year to fa­mil­iarise them­selves with the pro­ceed­ings of the Unesco in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage meet­ing.</p>
    <p>All these ef­forts have moved Sin­ga­pore past the first hur­dle, af­ter an eval­u­a­tion body com­pris­ing 12 ex­perts from around the world rec­om­mended last month that the in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee in charge of the fi­nal ver­dict ac­cept the nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture will join the more than 463 items al­ready on the list. It will be Sin­ga­pore’s first item on the Unesco in­tan­gi­ble her­itage list, and a vic­tory bell for the coun­try’s hawker sec­tor, which has in re­cent years been threat­ened by a lack of in­ter­est from young peo­ple in con­tin­u­ing the prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Long-suf­fer­ing hawk­ers are look­ing for­ward to the sweet taste of vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Madam Tee Chun Moy, 60, who has sold yong tau foo for 36 years, said: “I will feel very proud. I used to have to pro­vide my own ta­bles for peo­ple to eat my food and some­times these would even be stolen. Now, I can hold my head high and know my suf­fer­ing was worth it.”</p>
    <p>As for other cul­tural con­tenders, this is not the end of the road to Unesco recog­ni­tion. Those in­volved in the process said more nom­i­na­tions such as for xinyao, or Chi­nese folk songs, could be put for­ward in the fu­ture.</p>
