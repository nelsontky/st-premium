    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Chad­wick Bose­man, who died at 43 of colon can­cer last month, em­bod­ied a dic­tum of late nov­el­ist James Bald­win: “His­tory is not the past. It is the present. We carry our his­tory with us. We are our his­tory.”</p>
    <p>Bose­man car­ried the Amer­i­can his­tory in­sis­tently, im­bu­ing titans of the real and imag­ined worlds with the best parts of him­self.</p>
    <p>He recog­nised that they, too, make metaphors out of his­tory even as it is be­ing rewrit­ten with ev­ery breath. He un­der­stood how ex­haust­ing it is to be made ac­count­able minute by minute, how small al­most all of us be­come in­side that kind of ac­count­ing.</p>
    <p>What does it mean to be a cine­matic cit­i­zen of the mind – cheek­bones writ large, smil­ing like a big idea? There is self-pos­ses­sion in that un­der­stand­ing, broad-shoul­dered chin to the sun. Re­storer, re-his­tori­ciser of the black back­drop in the United States and else­where.</p>
    <p>What about mas­culin­ity and iso­la­tion? What about the un­re­lent­ing grav­ity of com­mu­nity ex­pec­ta­tions and as­pi­ra­tions? Right in the nexus of need, try­ing to Mashed Po­tato be­tween ex­pres­sion, obli­ga­tion, light bills and won­der. How does his­tory ren­der the heavy load of it­self unto it­self?</p>
    <p>In lead roles, Bose­man mostly played the out­lier: the one with con­vic­tion, the one with enough crust and where­withal to un­der­stand that ev­ery­body from the high step­pers to the low downs is made of an­tiq­uity, sun­light and iron.</p>
    <p>What hap­pens with that mix is the real alchemy, and he used it to re-di­men­sion their largess and re­de­fine their rough mul­ti­tudes. The hu­man ca­pac­ity to harm other hu­mans is as in­ex­haustible as grav­ity, but not as in­evitable.</p>
    <p>It is not a metaphor that Bose­man, who played base­ball player Jackie Robin­son in the movie 42 (2013), died on Jackie Robin­son Day 2020. It is only not enough and gone too soon, the same way you might catch the tas­selled edge of some­one round­ing a win­ter cor­ner just as the flur­ries set­tle on your fore­head and cheeks.</p>
    <p>It is hard not to think about un­buck­led his­tory while watch­ing Bose­man’s Stormin’ Nor­man in the movie Da 5 Bloods (2020).</p>
    <p>He is com­plicit in vi­o­lence even as he tries to free him­self of it. He sees the long his­tory of it be­ing re­vis­ited bul­let by bul­let and can­not fig­ure out how to stop it. The per­sis­tent co­nun­drum of mas­culin­ity, whether in a ball­park in Brook­lyn, a court­room in Con­necti­cut or a Hol­ly­wood pre­miere.</p>
    <p>As dis­tract­ingly beau­ti­ful as he was, Bose­man still man­aged to let the char­ac­ters he played be seen fully with all their rips and scuffs.</p>
    <p>There is a chaotic scene in the movie Get On Up (2014) that takes place right af­ter the as­sas­si­na­tion of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, in which Bose­man as singer</p>
    <p>James Brown ad­mon­ishes the crowd for try­ing to get on­stage to dance with him.</p>
    <p>“Let’s rep­re­sent our­selves,” he says. “You make me look bad. We are black. Don’t make us all look bad.”</p>
    <p>As if his­tory needs a kind of ve­neer, even in the mo­ment. Lib­er­a­tion’s op­po­site from James Brown, who loos­ened up al­most ev­ery­body who camel walked with him.</p>
    <p>Some­times, a coun­try dis­likes its metaphor so much that it cov­ers up in a bro­cade of syco­phancy. Some­times, lan­guage mis­shapes be­cause of in­sis­tent vi­o­lence: deco­rum for­got­ten, ref­er­en­dums ig­nored, and the racism flags are ev­ery­where with their snakes and stars and mis­matched colours twist­ing over the lo­cal houses.</p>
    <p>On the mar­quee at the theatre across the street: a poster for Black Pan­ther (2018) with Bose­man’s un­masked face look­ing down, clawed gloves curled in­wards.</p>
    <p>In the un­re­pen­tant shad­ows, it is hard to tell if he is study­ing or me­di­at­ing, but it is still a beat­i­tude of black­ness: colour as sig­ni­fier, colour as arte­fact, colour as stone cold fact.</p>
    <p>We can never know the authen­tic ver­sion of a per­son, whether it is Jackie Robin­son, US Supreme Court Jus­tice Thur­good Mar­shall in Mar­shall (2017) or Bose­man cos­tumed as T’Challa in Black Pan­ther.</p>
    <p>What­ever we think we know about the ac­tor, one thing is for real: He shared his char­ac­ters’ nu­ances like gen­tle li­ba­tions, and by “share”, I mean that phys­i­cally, what he held them out to us with both hands.</p>
    <p>Here, take this, he says, and in his cupped palms is a mem­ory of a first at-bat, a thun­der­clap from a dis­tant Tues­day or a bright morn­ing in Wakanda when the sun, just crest­ing the in­fi­nite sky­line, blinks against the mir­rored win­dows.</p>
    <p>This is for you, he says, and we get to see all the pos­si­bil­ity he wants us to know.</p>
