    <p>When talk­ing among them­selves, Sil­i­con Val­ley big shots some­times say weird things. In an in­ter­nal pre­sen­ta­tion in March 2018, Google ex­ec­u­tives were asked to imag­ine their com­pany act­ing as a “good cen­sor”, in or­der to limit the im­pact of users “be­hav­ing badly”.</p>
    <p>In a 2016 in­ter­nal video, Google’s head of de­sign Nick Foster en­vi­sioned a “goal-driven ledger” of all users’ data, en­dowed with its own “vo­li­tion or pur­pose”, which would nudge us to take de­ci­sions (say, about shop­ping or travel) that would “re­flect Google’s val­ues as an or­gan­i­sa­tion”. If that doesn’t strike you as weird – like di­a­logue from some dystopian sci­ence fic­tion novel – then you need to read more dystopian sci­ence fic­tion.</p>
    <p>I don’t know if, as the New York Post al­leged last week, Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den met a Ukrainian en­ergy ex­ec­u­tive named Vadym Pozharskyi in 2015. I don’t know if Mr Bi­den’s son Hunter tried to bro­ker such a meet­ing as part of his board di­rec­tor­ship deal with Mr Pozharskyi’s firm, Burisma Hold­ings. And I am pretty doubt­ful that the meet­ing, if it did hap­pen, was the rea­son Mr Bi­den de­manded that the Ukrainian gov­ern­ment fire its pros­e­cu­tor gen­eral, Mr Vik­tor Shokin, who was in­ves­ti­gat­ing Burisma.</p>
    <p>I am even open to the the­ory that the whole story is bunk, the e-mails fake, and the lap­top and its hard drive an in­fowars gift from Rus­sia, with love.</p>
    <p>What I do know is that if I read the story on­line and found it com­pelling, I should have been able to share it with friends. In­stead, both Face­book and</p>
    <p>Twit­ter made a de­ci­sion to try to kill the Post’s scoop.</p>
    <p>Mr Andy Stone, the former Demo­cratic Party staff mem­ber who is now Face­book’s pol­icy com­mu­ni­ca­tions manager, an­nounced that his com­pany would be “re­duc­ing” the “dis­tri­bu­tion” of the Post story. Twit­ter barred its users from shar­ing it not only with fol­low­ers but also through direct mes­sages, lock­ing the ac­counts of people – in­clud­ing White House press sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany – who had retweeted it.</p>
    <p>This is not an iso­lated in­ci­dent. In May, Twit­ter at­tached a health warn­ing to one of President Don­ald Trump’s tweets. There was an uproar at Face­book when chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zucker­berg de­clined to fol­low Twit­ter’s lead. Days later, Face­book was pres­sured into tak­ing down 88 Trump campaign ads that used an in­verted red tri­an­gle (a Nazi sym­bol) to at­tack An­tifa, the far-left move­ment.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Face­book re­moved a group with nearly 200,000 mem­bers “for re­peat­edly post­ing con­tent that vi­o­lated our poli­cies”. The group promoted the QAnon con­spir­acy the­ory, which is broadly pro-Trump. Ear­lier this month, Face­book deleted all QAnon ac­counts from its plat­forms. Google has been do­ing the same sort of thing. In June, it ex­cluded the web­site ZeroHedge from its ad plat­form be­cause of “vi­o­la­tions” in the com­ments sec­tions of sto­ries about Black Lives Mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The re­mark­able thing is not that Sil­i­con Val­ley is play­ing a highly ques­tion­able role in the 2020 election. It is that the same was true in 2016 and, de­spite a great many fine words and some mi­nor pieces of leg­is­la­tion, Amer­i­cans did noth­ing about it. Far from ad­dress­ing the glar­ing prob­lems cre­ated by the rise of the net­work plat­forms that now dom­i­nate the Amer­i­can (and in­deed the global) pub­lic sphere, we largely de­cided to shut our eyes and ears to them.</p>
    <p>Yet the new role of so­cial me­dia is star­ing us in the face (lit­er­ally). The number of US Face­book users was 240 mil­lion last year, more than 72 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion. Adults spend an av­er­age of 75 min­utes of each day on so­cial me­dia. Half that time is on Face­book. Google ac­counts for 88 per cent of the US search-en­gine mar­ket, and 95 per cent of all mo­bile searches. Be­tween them, Google and Face­book cap­tured a com­bined 60 per cent of US dig­i­tal-ad spend­ing in 2018. The top US tech firms are now among the big­gest busi­nesses on earth by mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>AN­TITRUST AC­TION NOT THE REM­EDY</p>
    <p>But their size is not the im­por­tant thing about them. This month, the House Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee’s An­titrust Sub­com­mit­tee re­leased the find­ings of its 16-month-long investigat­ion into Big Tech. The con­clu­sion? “Ap­ple, Ama­zon, Google and Face­book each pos­sess sig­nif­i­cant mar­ket power over large swathes of our econ­omy. In re­cent years, each com­pany has ex­panded and ex­ploited their power of the mar­ket­place in anti-com­pet­i­tive ways.”</p>
    <p>Cue years of an­titrust ac­tions that will en­rich a great many lawyers and have min­i­mal con­se­quences for com­pe­ti­tion, like the ul­ti­mately failed at­tempt 20 years ago to pre­vent Mi­crosoft from dom­i­nat­ing soft­ware.</p>
    <p>An an­titrust ac­tion against Ama­zon is doomed. Con­sumers love the com­pany. It has mea­sur­ably re­duced the prices of in­nu­mer­able prod­ucts as well as ren­der­ing shop­ping in brick-and-mor­tar stores an ob­so­les­cent ac­tiv­ity. Good luck, too, with break­ing up Google. Even the much less trusted Face­book will be hard to dis­man­tle with­out a com­plete trans­for­ma­tion of the way the courts ap­ply com­pe­ti­tion law. It’s free, for heaven’s sake.</p>
    <p>And there are net­work ef­fects on the In­ter­net that can’t be wished away by judges.</p>
    <p>THE PUB­LIC SPHERE</p>
    <p>The core prob­lem is not a lack of com­pe­ti­tion in Sil­i­con Val­ley. It is that the net­work plat­forms are now the pub­lic sphere.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery other part of what we call the me­dia – news­pa­pers, mag­a­zines, even ca­ble TV – is now sub­or­di­nated to them. Last year, the av­er­age Amer­i­can spent</p>
    <p>6 hours and 35 min­utes a day us­ing dig­i­tal me­dia, more than tele­vi­sion, ra­dio and print put to­gether. Not only do the big tech com­pa­nies dom­i­nate ad rev­enue, they drive the news cy­cle.</p>
    <p>In 2017, two-thirds of Amer­i­can adults said they got their news from so­cial me­dia sites. A Pew study showed that, at the end of last year, 18 per cent of them re­lied pri­mar­ily on so­cial me­dia for po­lit­i­cal news. Among those aged 30 to 49, the share was 40 per cent; among those aged 18 to 29, it was 48 per cent.</p>
    <p>The patholo­gies that flow from this new re­al­ity are nu­mer­ous. An­titrust ac­tions ad­dress none of them.</p>
    <p>“I thought once ev­ery­body could speak freely and ex­change in­for­ma­tion and ideas, the world is au­to­mat­i­cally go­ing to be a bet­ter place,” Mr Evan Wil­liams, one of the founders of Twit­ter, told The New York Times in 2017. “I was wrong about that.” In­deed, he was.</p>
    <p>The vul­ner­a­bil­ity of the net­work plat­forms to out­side ma­nip­u­la­tion has posed and con­tin­ues to pose a serious threat to na­tional se­cu­rity. Yet half-hearted and ill-con­sid­ered at­tempts by the com­pa­nies to reg­u­late them­selves bet­ter have led to le­git­i­mate com­plaints that they are re­strict­ing free speech.</p>
    <p>How did we ar­rive at this state of af­fairs – when such im­por­tant com­po­nents of the pub­lic sphere could op­er­ate solely with re­gard to their own prof­itabil­ity as at­ten­tion mer­chants?</p>
    <p>ROOT OF THE PROB­LEM</p>
    <p>The an­swer lies in the his­tory of Amer­i­can In­ter­net reg­u­la­tion – to be pre­cise, in Sec­tion 230 of the 1934 Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Act, as amended by the 1996 Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions Act, which was en­acted af­ter a New York court held on­line ser­vice provider Prodigy li­able for a user’s defam­a­tory posts.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, a com­pany that man­aged con­tent was clas­si­fied as a pub­lisher, and sub­ject to civil li­a­bil­ity – cre­at­ing a per­verse in­cen­tive not to man­age con­tent at all. Thus, Sec­tion 230c, “Pro­tec­tion for ‘Good Sa­mar­i­tan’ block­ing and screen­ing of of­fen­sive ma­te­rial”, was writ­ten to en­cour­age nascent firms to pro­tect users and pre­vent il­le­gal ac­tiv­ity with­out in­cur­ring mas­sive con­tent-man­age­ment costs. It states:</p>
    <p>• No provider or user of an in­ter­ac­tive com­puter ser­vice shall be treated as the pub­lisher or speaker of any in­for­ma­tion pro­vided by another in­for­ma­tion con­tent provider.</p>
    <p>• No provider or user of an in­ter­ac­tive com­puter ser­vice shall be held li­able on ac­count of any ac­tion vol­un­tar­ily taken in good faith to re­strict ac­cess to or avail­abil­ity of ma­te­rial that the provider or user con­sid­ers to be ob­scene, lewd, las­civ­i­ous, filthy, ex­ces­sively vi­o­lent, ha­rass­ing or oth­er­wise ob­jec­tion­able.</p>
    <p>In essence, Sec­tion 230 gave and still gives web­sites im­mu­nity from li­a­bil­ity for what their users post (un­der-fil­ter­ing), but it also pro­tects them when they choose to re­move con­tent (over-fil­ter­ing).</p>
    <p>The idea was to split the dif­fer­ence be­tween pub­lisher’s li­a­bil­ity, which would have stunted the growth of the fledg­ling In­ter­net, and com­plete lack of cu­ra­tion, which would have led to a tor­rent of filth.</p>
    <p>The surely un­in­tended re­sult is that some of the big­gest com­pa­nies in the world to­day are util­i­ties when they are act­ing as pub­lish­ers, but pub­lish­ers when act­ing as util­i­ties, in a way rather rem­i­nis­cent of Joseph Heller’s Catch-22.</p>
    <p>Here’s how Catch-22 works. If one of the plat­forms hosts con­tent that is men­da­cious, defam­a­tory or in some other way harm­ful, and you sue, the Big Tech lawyers will cite Sec­tion 230: Hey, we’re just a tech com­pany, it’s not our ma­li­cious con­tent. But if you write some­thing that falls afoul of their con­tent-mod­er­a­tion rules and duly van­ishes from the In­ter­net, they’ll cite Sec­tion 230 again: Hey, we’re a pri­vate com­pany, the First Amend­ment doesn’t ap­ply to us. Re­mem­ber the “good cen­sor”?</p>
    <p>THE NEW GOVER­NORS</p>
    <p>Another in­flu­en­tial way of de­scrib­ing the net­work plat­forms is as the “new gover­nors”. For years, the big tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies have fil­tered out child pornog­ra­phy and (less suc­cess­fully) ter­ror­ist pro­pa­ganda. But there has been mis­sion creep.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Twit­ter added a new line to its rules that barred pro­mot­ing “vi­o­lence against oth­ers... on the ba­sis of race, eth­nic­ity, na­tional ori­gin, re­li­gion, sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion, gen­der, gen­der iden­tity, age, or dis­abil­ity”.</p>
    <p>Re­peat­edly through­out the Trump pres­i­dency – for ex­am­ple, af­ter the vi­o­lence in Char­lottesvill­e, Vir­ginia in 2017 – there have been fur­ther mod­i­fi­ca­tions to the plat­forms’ terms of ser­vice and “com­mu­nity stan­dards”, as well as to their non-pub­lic con­tent mod­er­a­tion poli­cies.</p>
    <p>There is no need to de­tail all the oc­ca­sions in re­cent years when mostly right-lean­ing con­tent was cen­sored, buried far down the search re­sults, or “de­mon­e­tised”.</p>
    <p>The key point is that, in the ab­sence of a co­her­ent re­form of the way the net­work plat­forms are them­selves gov­erned, there has been a dys­func­tional tug-of-war be­tween the plat­forms’ spas­modic and not wholly sin­cere ef­forts to “fix” them­selves and the de­mands of out­side ac­tors (rang­ing from the Ger­man gov­ern­ment to groups of left-wing ac­tivists) for more cen­sor­ship of what­ever they deem to be “hate speech”.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the found­ing gen­er­a­tion of Sil­i­con Val­ley en­trepreneur­s, most of whom had lib­er­tar­ian in­cli­na­tions, have re­peat­edly yielded to in­ter­nal pres­sure from their younger em­ploy­ees, schooled in the mod­ern cam­pus cul­ture of</p>
    <p>“no-plat­form­ing” any in­di­vid­u­als whose ideas they con­sider “un­safe”.</p>
    <p>In the words of former Face­book en­gi­neer Brian Amerige, whose ca­reer at the com­pany ended not long af­ter he cre­ated a “FB’ers for po­lit­i­cal diver­sity” group, the com­pany’s em­ploy­ees “are quick to at­tack – of­ten in mobs – any­one who presents a view that ap­pears to be in op­po­si­tion to left-lean­ing ide­ol­ogy”.</p>
    <p>WORST OF BOTH WORLDS</p>
    <p>The net re­sult seems to be the worst of both worlds.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, con­spir­acy the­o­ries such as Plan­demic flour­ish on Face­book and else­where. On the other, the net­work plat­forms ar­bi­trar­ily in­ter­vene when a le­git­i­mate ar­ti­cle trig­gers the hate-speech-spot­ting al­go­rithms and the con­tent-mod­er­at­ing grunts. (As one of them de­scribed the process, “I was like, ‘I can just block this en­tire do­main, and they won’t be able to serve ads on it?’ And the an­swer was, ‘Yes.’ I was like, ‘But... I’m in my mid-20s’.”)</p>
    <p>At a lec­ture at Ge­orge­town Univer­sity in Oc­to­ber last year, Mr Zucker­berg pledged “to con­tinue to stand for free ex­pres­sion” and against an “ever-ex­pand­ing def­i­ni­tion of what speech is harm­ful”. But even Face­book has had to ramp up the cen­sor­ship this year.</p>
    <p>The bot­tom line is that the good cen­sors are not very good and the new gover­nors can’t even gov­ern them­selves.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, only two re­forms will fix this go­daw­ful mess. First, we need to re­peal or sig­nif­i­cantly amend Sec­tion 230, mak­ing the net­work plat­forms legally li­able for the con­tent they host, and leav­ing the rest to the courts.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, we need to im­pose the equiv­a­lent of First Amend­ment obli­ga­tions on the net­work plat­forms, recog­nis­ing that they are too dom­i­nant a part of the pub­lic sphere to be able to reg­u­late ac­cess to it on the ba­sis of their own pri­vately de­ter­mined and al­most cer­tainly skewed “com­mu­nity stan­dards”.</p>
    <p>To such pro­pos­als, Big Tech lawyers re­spond by lament­ing that they would mas­sively in­crease their clients’ le­gal li­a­bil­i­ties. Yes. That is the whole idea. The plat­forms will fi­nally dis­cover that there are risks to be­ing a pub­lisher and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties that come with near-univer­sal us­age.</p>
    <p>In 1931, then Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Stan­ley Bald­win ac­cused the prin­ci­pal news­pa­per barons of the day, Lords Beaver­brook and Rother­mere, of “aim­ing at... power, and power with­out re­spon­si­bil­ity – the prerog­a­tive of the har­lot through­out the ages”. (The phrase was his cousin Rud­yard Ki­pling’s.)</p>
    <p>As I con­tem­plate the un­der-cov­ered and over-mighty role that Big Tech con­tin­ues to play in the Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal process, I don’t see good cen­sors. I see big, bad har­lots.</p>
