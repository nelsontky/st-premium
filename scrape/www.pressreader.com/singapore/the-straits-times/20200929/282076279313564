    <p>From Thurs­day, a new Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) on­line ser­vice will al­low peo­ple to change their lo­cal or over­seas res­i­den­tial ad­dress.</p>
    <p>With this ser­vice, those who wish to process a change of ad­dress will no longer be able to do so at neigh­bour­hood po­lice posts or neigh­bour­hood po­lice cen­tres from Dec 1.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants can ac­cess the change of ad­dress e-Ser­vice at ICA’s web­site us­ing their SingPass and fol­low­ing a few ba­sic steps. The web­site is go.gov.sg/ic-ad­dress</p>
    <p>Within three to five days, they will re­ceive a unique per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber (PIN) sent by mail to their new ad­dress. In­ter­na­tional de­liv­ery time will vary based on the des­ti­na­tion coun­try’s postal ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants will be asked to en­ter the PIN via the e-Ser­vice to ver­ify the new ad­dress. Upon ver­i­fi­ca­tion, an in­stant ac­knowl­edge­ment will be sent to in­di­cate the change of ad­dress is suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>The new ad­dress will be up­dated in the data­bases of public agen­cies within one work­ing day.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond let­ter will then be sent to the ap­pli­cant, con­tain­ing a sticker with the new ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants must af­fix the sticker to the back of their NRIC ac­cord­ing to the instructio­ns.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Na­tional Reg­is­tra­tion Act, all NRIC hold­ers need to re­port a change of ad­dress within 28 days of mov­ing to a new res­i­dence, whether it is lo­cated in or out­side of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>ICA’s new e-Ser­vice will be avail­able in English, Chi­nese, Malay and Tamil.</p>
    <p>Those re­sid­ing in the same house­hold can also up­date their ad­dress with a sin­gle ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>If they are not able to sub­mit ap­pli­ca­tions through the on­line ser­vice, they may ap­point prox­ies who are SingPass hold­ers to sub­mit the ap­pli­ca­tion on their be­half. The prox­ies must pro­vide the ap­pli­cant’s NRIC num­ber and its date of is­sue to ac­cess the e-Ser­vice. To com­plete the process, the prox­ies must also ob­tain and en­ter the PIN mailed to the ap­pli­cant’s new ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Those who are un­able to ap­ply for a change of ad­dress on­line and do not have prox­ies may visit ICA for as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Users of the new e-Ser­vice should also note that en­force­ment ac­tion will be taken against any­one who mis­uses it.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Na­tional Reg­is­tra­tion Reg­u­la­tions, any­one who re­ports a false res­i­den­tial ad­dress can be fined up to $3,000, jailed for two years, or both.</p>
