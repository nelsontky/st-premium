    <p>In­dia and China have agreed to a di­plo­matic dis­en­gage­ment along their dis­puted bor­der in the Ladakh re­gion, but the road ahead re­mains rocky. The view is that the sit­u­a­tion re­mains un­pre­dictable and that both sides have dug in for the win­ter months.</p>
    <p>In­dia and China have agreed to a di­plo­matic dis­en­gage­ment along their dis­puted bor­der in the Ladakh re­gion, but the road ahead re­mains rocky, given the com­plete break­down of trust be­tween both coun­tries and the large as­sem­blage of troops and weaponry po­si­tioned along the bor­der.</p>
    <p>In­dia and China have seen the worst bor­der trou­bles in four decades in the Ladakh re­gion amid com­pet­ing ter­ri­to­rial claims.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent ten­sions are cen­tred on Pan­gong Tso lake.</p>
    <p>Last month, In­dian troops pre­vented their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts from oc­cu­py­ing van­tage po­si­tions on the south­ern bank of the lake, even as Chi­nese troops have pre­vented In­dian troops from pa­trolling ar­eas on the north­ern bank that were ear­lier ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Progress on the di­plo­matic front came about after Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­is­ter S. Jais­hankar met his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Wang Yi on the side­lines of the Shang­hai Co­op­er­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion in Moscow last week.</p>
    <p>The two, ac­cord­ing to a joint state­ment, agreed to a five-point agenda, in­clud­ing not al­low­ing dif­fer­ences to be­come dis­putes, or­der­ing troops to con­tinue their di­a­logue, and abid­ing by all ear­lier bor­der agree­ments and pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Still, these broad out­lines need to be trans­lated on the ground through mil­i­tary di­a­logue, which has so far yielded lit­tle in terms of break­ing the im­passe.</p>
    <p>In­dian an­a­lysts be­lieve it is not go­ing to be easy.</p>
    <p>Lieu­tenant-Gen­eral (Ret) D.S. Hooda, who served as the In­dian mil­i­tary’s north­ern com­man­der, said: “What are the prin­ci­ples of dis­en­gage­ment? This needs to be de­cided at the di­plo­matic and po­lit­i­cal lev­els, and then the two armies can meet and look at how to ex­e­cute the modal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“That doesn’t seem to have hap­pened. I think the sit­u­a­tion is still very sen­si­tive on the ground.”</p>
    <p>He added: “When some kind of dis­en­gage­ment starts on the ground, you will see some jock­ey­ing for po­si­tion... and that car­ries the risk of lo­cal mil­i­tary es­ca­la­tion. I don’t think ei­ther side wants to get in­volved in full-scale con­flict or war, that is for sure.”</p>
    <p>In­dian sources said that there has been no “vis­i­ble change” on the ground since the high-level di­plo­matic talks. Dates for mil­i­tary talks are yet to be an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Bor­der trou­ble be­tween In­dia and China is noth­ing new.</p>
    <p>Both sides have dif­fer­ent views on where the bound­ary lines are along many parts of the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol (LAC), or the de facto bor­der.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries have ac­cused the other of cross­ing into their ter­ri­tory and tak­ing ag­gres­sive po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s De­fence Min­is­ter Ra­j­nath Singh said in Par­lia­ment: “There is no com­monly de­lin­eated Line of Ac­tual Con­trol in the bor­der ar­eas and no com­mon per­cep­tion of the en­tire LAC.</p>
    <p>“The dif­fer­ence in per­cep­tion has led to the face-off at the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh also in­di­cated that the coun­try was “pre­pared for all out­comes to en­sure that In­dia’s sovereignt­y is main­tained”.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent con­flict started with the troops’ build-up in April and in­ten­si­fied fol­low­ing a vi­o­lent clash in the Gal­wan Val­ley, where sol­diers were killed.</p>
    <p>In spite of mul­ti­ple rounds of mil­i­tary and di­plo­matic talks, ten­sions have con­tin­ued to sim­mer. Early this month, warn­ing shots were fired in the first fir­ing in­ci­dent along the bor­der in 45 years.</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral agree­ments be­tween In­dia and China from 1996 and 2005 do not per­mit the use of firearms dur­ing face-offs.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing last week’s five-point con­sen­sus reached by the two for­eign min­is­ters, China Daily noted in an edi­to­rial: “The con­sen­sus, above all, tes­ti­fies to the fact that despite height­ened ten­sions along the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol for months, the two neigh­bours still be­lieve in re­solv­ing their dif­fer­ences through talks, keep­ing the big­ger pic­ture of bi­lat­eral re­la­tions in mind.”</p>
    <p>Still, the bor­der sit­u­a­tion re­mains un­pre­dictable, as troops on both sides ap­pear to be dig­ging in for the win­ter months.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor B. R. Deepak from the Cen­tre for Chi­nese and South East Asian Stud­ies at Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity said: “They (the In­dian and Chi­nese sol­diers) are there for the long haul.. given the equip­ment and other para­pher­na­lia. Both sides are pre­par­ing for the worst.”</p>
