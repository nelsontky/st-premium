    <p>WASHINGTON • As US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den pre­pares to name his first Cabi­net ap­pointees, more Repub­li­cans are start­ing to push for the tran­si­tion to of­fi­cially be­gin and call­ing on their col­leagues to openly ac­knowl­edge his vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Chris Christie, New Jersey’s for­mer gov­er­nor, called the con­duct of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s le­gal team, which has in­dulged in a web of con­spir­acy the­o­ries about voter fraud, “a na­tional em­bar­rass­ment”, given the blis­ter­ing dis­missals of their law­suits in court and their fail­ure to pro­duce ev­i­dence of wide­spread fraud.</p>
    <p>“They al­lege fraud out­side the court­room, but when they go inside the court­room, they don’t plead fraud and they don’t ar­gue fraud,” Mr Christie, a l ong­time Trump ally, said on ABC’s This Week on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“Elec­tions have con­se­quences, and we can­not con­tinue to act as if some­thing hap­pened here that didn’t hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign on Sun­day dis­avowed Ms Sid­ney Pow­ell, one of the lawyers who had floated many base­less claims, even though she had ap­peared at a news con­fer­ence along­side Mr Trump’s lawyers and cam­paign officials and been em­braced by al­lies.</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia’s Sen­a­tor Pa­trick Toomey last Saturday con­grat­u­lated Mr Bi­den and Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Harris on their vic­tory, say­ing Mr Trump had “ex­hausted all plau­si­ble le­gal op­tions to chal­lenge” the state’s re­sult af­ter a fed­eral j udge dis­missed a Trump cam­paign law­suit chal­leng­ing the elec­tion out­come there.</p>
    <p>Many of the strong­est de­nun­ci­a­tions of Mr Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede have come from Repub­li­cans who are no longer in of­fice or have an­nounced their re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>But as Mr Trump keeps deny­ing the re­sults of the elec­tion in an un­flinch­ing as­sault on the demo­cratic process, a few more sit­ting law­mak­ers have urged him to at least be­gin the tran­si­tion process.</p>
    <p>Ms Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Repub­li­can in the House, last Friday be­came the most se­nior Repub­li­can to urge Mr Trump to be­gin “re­spect­ing the sanc­tity of our elec­toral process” should the na­tion’s courts con­tinue to re­ject his le­gal team’s chal­lenges to the out­come.</p>
    <p>Still, most Repub­li­can law­mak­ers have not chal­lenged Mr Trump, in part be­cause they fear that a pub­lic ac­knowl­edge­ment of Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory could un­der­cut sup­port from their con­ser­va­tive base be­fore two crit­i­cal Se­nate run-off elec­tions in Ge­or­gia in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The few Repub­li­cans who made their own as­cer­tain­ment in the 15 days since Mr Bi­den won the vote have grown more blunt.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Lisa Murkowski re­leased a state­ment con­demn­ing Mr Trump’s pres­sure cam­paign on state leg­is­la­tures as “not only un­prece­dented but in­con­sis­tent with our demo­cratic process”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s time is run­ning out, as states in­clud­ing Michi­gan and Penn­syl­va­nia pre­pared to cer­tify their elec­tion re­sults as soon as yes­ter­day, seal­ing Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign filed no­tice that it was ap­peal­ing the dis­missal of a fed­eral law­suit that aimed to block Penn­syl­va­nia from cer­ti­fy­ing its elec­tion re­sults un­less the state in­val­i­dated tens of thou­sands of mail-in bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Suits filed by the cam­paign and its GOP al­lies have failed in Michi­gan, Ge­or­gia, Ne­vada and Ari­zona as judges de­clined to toss out mil­lions of votes based on claims tied to a vast and im­plau­si­ble con­spir­acy the­ory about cor­rupt Demo­cratic elec­tion work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Trump is mount­ing a less high-pro­file but sim­i­larly au­da­cious bid to keep con­trol of the Repub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee even af­ter he leaves of­fice.</p>
    <p>Ms Ronna McDaniel, his hand­picked chair, has se­cured the Pres­i­dent’s sup­port for her re-elec­tion to an­other term in Jan­uary, when the party is ex­pected to gather for its win­ter meet­ing.</p>
    <p>But her in­ten­tion to run with Mr Trump’s bless­ing has in­cited a be­hind-the-scenes proxy bat­tle, di­vid­ing Repub­li­cans be­tween those who be­lieve the na­tional party should not be a po­lit­i­cal sub­sidiary of the out­go­ing pres­i­dent and oth­ers happy for Mr Trump to re­main in con­trol of it.</p>
