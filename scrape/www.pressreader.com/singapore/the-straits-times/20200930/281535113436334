    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion says that about 120 mil­lion rapid di­ag­nos­tic tests for the coro­n­avirus will be made avail­able to low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries at a max­i­mum cost of US$5 (S$6.90) each. The wider avail­abil­ity of the tests will help 133 coun­tries track cases and con­tain the spread of the virus, clos­ing the gap with wealthy ones.</p>
    <p>GENEVA/LON­DON About 120 mil­lion rapid di­ag­nos­tic tests for the coro­n­avirus will be made avail­able to low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries at a max­i­mum cost of US$5 (S$6.90) each, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has said.</p>
    <p>The wider avail­abil­ity of quick, reli­able and in­ex­pen­sive tests will help 133 coun­tries track cases and con­tain the spread, clos­ing the gap with wealthy ones, it said.</p>
    <p>WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus on Mon­day said Ab­bott and SD Biosen­sor had agreed with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion to “make 120 mil­lion of th­ese new, highly por­ta­ble and easy-to-use rapid Covid-19 di­ag­nos­tic tests avail­able over a pe­riod of six months”.</p>
    <p>He told a news con­fer­ence in Geneva that the tests were priced at a max­i­mum of US$5 each, but were ex­pected to be­come cheaper.</p>
    <p>“We have an agree­ment, we have seed fund­ing and now we need the full amount of funds to buy th­ese tests,” Dr Te­dros said. “This will en­able the ex­pan­sion of test­ing, par­tic­u­larly in hard-to-reach ar­eas that do not have lab­o­ra­tory fa­cil­i­ties or enough trained health work­ers to carry out tests.</p>
    <p>“This is a vi­tal ad­di­tion to the test­ing ca­pac­ity and es­pe­cially im­por­tant in ar­eas of high trans­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>Dr Catha­rina Boehme, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Foun­da­tion for In­no­va­tive New Di­ag­nos­tics, a Genev­abased non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion in the pro­ject, said the deal was a ma­jor mile­stone as it was ur­gent to in­crease test­ing in poorer coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“It is our first line of de­fence, crit­i­cal for coun­tries to track, trace and iso­late to stop the spread of the virus and to en­sure that we are not fly­ing blind,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We now have two high-qual­ity tests which are the first in a series that are be­ing de­vel­oped and as­sessed by WHO for emer­gency use list­ing,” Dr Boehme added.</p>
    <p>Although the quick tests in the US$600 mil­lion scheme are not as reli­able as the reg­u­lar poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) nasal swab tests, they are far faster, cheaper and eas­ier to carry out.</p>
    <p>The tests – which do not re­quire a lab­o­ra­tory – pro­vide reli­able re­sults in just 15 min­utes rather than hours or days, and will help ex­pand test­ing, Dr Boehme said, adding that “the tests are as sim­ple to use as preg­nancy tests”.</p>
    <p>The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and Malaria – another Geneva-based group – was pro­vid­ing an ini­tial US$50 mil­lion to the pro­cure­ment fund, she said.</p>
    <p>Global Fund ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Peter Sands said the quick tests were no sil­ver bul­let, but were a hugely valu­able com­ple­ment to PCR tests.</p>
    <p>“Although they are a bit less ac­cu­rate, they’re much faster, cheaper and don’t re­quire a lab,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This will en­able low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries to be­gin to close the dra­matic gap in test­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sands said that high-in­come coun­tries now con­duct 292 tests a day for ev­ery 100,000 peo­ple, up­per-mid­dle-in­come coun­tries 77, lower-mid­dle-in­come coun­tries 61, and low-in­come coun­tries 14.</p>
    <p>He said that if the poor­est coun­tries were test­ing at the same rate as the rich­est, 120 mil­lion tests would not last two weeks.</p>
    <p>The anti­gen tests could be used where PCR tests are un­avail­able or to quickly test con­tacts where a PCR test has con­firmed a case, and in places with wide­spread com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The first or­ders were go­ing in this week, Mr Sands added.</p>
    <p>The 120 mil­lion tests, be­ing pro­duced by US multi­na­tional Ab­bott and South Korea-based SD BioSen­sor, re­flect 20 per cent of the com­pa­nies’ man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity. The other 80 per cent re­mains avail­able for pro­cure­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s tech­ni­cal lead on Covid-19, said that more tests were un­der­go­ing eval­u­a­tion and would come on­line.</p>
    <p>They would be par­tic­u­larly use­ful in re­mote set­tings and to in­ves­ti­gate clus­ters quickly and bring them un­der con­trol, as well as in ar­eas with wide­spread com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“This will be really, really help­ful for com­mu­ni­ties and coun­tries to be able to know where is the virus and who is in­fected with the virus,” she said.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Rapid anti&#xAD;gen tests for Covid-19 do not re&#xAD;quire a lab&#xAD;o&#xAD;ra&#xAD;tory and can pro&#xAD;vide reli&#xAD;able re&#xAD;sults in just 15 min&#xAD;utes rather than hours or days, which makes them use&#xAD;ful in vil&#xAD;lages such as Mis&#xAD;rud (below) in the In&#xAD;dian state of Mad&#xAD;hya Pradesh. Such tests are par&#xAD;tic&#xAD;u&#xAD;larly handy in re&#xAD;mote set&#xAD;tings, in places where reg&#xAD;u&#xAD;lar poly&#xAD;merase chain re&#xAD;ac&#xAD;tion tests are not avail&#xAD;able, where there is wide&#xAD;spread com&#xAD;mu&#xAD;nity trans&#xAD;mis&#xAD;sion, or to quickly in&#xAD;ves&#xAD;ti&#xAD;gate clus&#xAD;ters.</p>
