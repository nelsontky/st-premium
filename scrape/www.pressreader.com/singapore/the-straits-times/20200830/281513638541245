    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has af­fected the lives of bil­lions world­wide, but for Sin­ga­porean Lee Tzyy Ian, 29, ev­ery­day life in Seoul has been largely un­af­fected in the past few months.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, who lives in the South Korean cap­i­tal with her hus­band Sung Sang-Kyu, 43, and daugh­ter, SiEun, three, could still go out to meet friends for food and drinks while tak­ing stan­dard pre­cau­tions such as wear­ing a mask and mak­ing sure to wash their hands of­ten.</p>
    <p>But af­ter a large Covid-19 clus­ter emerged at a church near her house ear­lier this month, the house­wife and her daugh­ter have been stay­ing home.</p>
    <p>“I have stopped send­ing my girl to day­care cen­tre for the mo­ment,” said Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>“My hus­band still heads out to work like nor­mal but my daugh­ter and I stay at home as we do not know who’s in­fected.”</p>
    <p>They or­der their gro­ceries on­line and get food de­liv­ered at home to avoid go­ing out.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee and her family are among Sin­ga­pore­ans in Seoul who are get­ting more con­cerned about the wors­en­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion af­ter months of rel­a­tive calm.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion re­ported 308 new coro­n­avirus cases, bring­ing the coun­try’s to­tal to 19,400, in­clud­ing 321deaths, as of Friday mid­night.</p>
    <p>Stricter curbs – such as re­strict­ing din­ing in hours and sus­pend­ing op­er­a­tion of in­door sports fa­cil­i­ties – have been an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo said at least 80 per cent of in­fec­tions over the past week are from the densely pop­u­lated Seoul metropoli­tan area and many are linked to the Sarang Jeil Church and a po­lit­i­cal rally on Aug 15.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, who lives a sub­way stop away from the Sarang Jeil church, said she was dev­as­tated that the out­break sit­u­a­tion is now back to square one.</p>
    <p>“My family mem­bers in Sin­ga­pore have been ask­ing me to be care­ful and to stay safe, as they know it is not easy to fly back now, es­pe­cially since I have a tod­dler with me.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chua Pei Chi, pres­i­dent of the in­for­mal Sin­ga­pore Club Seoul, said she knows of about 350 to 400 Sin­ga­pore­ans who are still stay­ing in the city.</p>
    <p>She re­turned to Sin­ga­pore last Wednes­day to visit her par­ents and is now quar­an­tined at the Grand Hy­att Ho­tel.</p>
    <p>“I think the Sin­ga­porean com­mu­nity is be­gin­ning to re­alise that the sit­u­a­tion is re­ally get­ting bad and some of them have de­cided to push back their plans, just to be safe,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, stu­dent Jess Ng, 25, who has been in South Korea for the last seven months, was due to sit for a Korean lan­guage pro­fi­ciency test in Seoul last week, but the exam was can­celled due to the rise in new Covid-19 cases .</p>
    <p>“My family has been ask­ing me to fly back but I ini­tially ex­tended my stay to take the exam. Right now, I am just mon­i­tor­ing the flight sit­u­a­tion since two of my plane tick­ets have al­ready been can­celled,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng said her life in Seoul has been nor­mal. She stays on her own and still goes out for meals.</p>
    <p>But she has seen some peo­ple protest­ing about their right to wor­ship in churches de­spite the pan­demic. Re­cently, a Covid-19 pa­tient es­caped from hos­pi­tal and was in her neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>She added: “I don’t think it’s sunk in for me that the sit­u­a­tion is wors­en­ing here in Seoul... as long as they are not lock­ing down the city, I am okay, I guess.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ken Ng, 50, who runs the Dessert Mer­lion Sin­ga­pore Cafe in Hong­dae in Seoul, said there are fewer peo­ple head­ing out, with the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion wors­en­ing.</p>
    <p>“You don’t re­ally feel the ten­sion here be­cause there are no strict rules that say you will get fined if you don’t do this,” he added.</p>
    <p>But his busi­ness has fallen by about 50 per cent. He is hop­ing the city can avoid a lock­down so that busi­ness will not be fur­ther hit.</p>
    <p>“As long as I can cover rental and over­heads, I am sat­is­fied al­ready,” he said.</p>
    <p>“What­ever hap­pens, I will think of a way to sur­vive. We have to be op­ti­mistic.”</p>
