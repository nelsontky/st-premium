    <p>PARIS • Air­line in­dus­try rev­enues are ex­pected to re­main 46 per cent lower next year than the US$838 bil­lion (S$1.1 tril­lion) booked in the last pre-coro­n­avirus year of 2019, the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata) said on Tues­day in a marked wors­en­ing of its fore­casts.</p>
    <p>Its pre­vi­ous out­look for a smaller drop of 29 per cent “was based on ex­pec­ta­tions for a de­mand re­cov­ery com­menc­ing in the fourth quar­ter of 2020”.</p>
    <p>That is now un­likely to ma­te­ri­alise be­cause of re­newed Covid-19 out­breaks and gov­ern­ment re­stric­tions in re­sponse, said the fed­er­a­tion rep­re­sent­ing 290 air­lines.</p>
    <p>Over the full year in 2020, Iata fore­casts a 66 per cent drop in traf­fic com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>Iata di­rec­tor gen­eral Alexan­dre de Ju­niac said in a state­ment: “The fourth quar­ter of 2020 will be ex­tremely dif­fi­cult and there is lit­tle in­di­ca­tion the first half of 2021 will be sig­nif­i­cantly bet­ter, so long as bor­ders re­main closed and/or ar­rival quar­an­tines re­main in place.”</p>
    <p>Even with dras­tic cost-cut­ting, air­lines will need fur­ther gov­ern­ment aid to avoid run­ning out of cash, he added.</p>
    <p>Iata also urged air­ports and air traf­fic con­trollers not to in­crease their prices to cover short­falls from the vastly lower traf­fic. And it warned that re­lief for air­lines this year on fuel costs, due to low oil prices, is ex­pected to fade away next year.</p>
    <p>“Even if we max­imise our cost cut</p>
    <p>DIM OUT­LOOK</p>
    <p>The fourth quar­ter of 2020 will be ex­tremely dif­fi­cult and there is lit­tle in­di­ca­tion the first half of 2021 will be sig­nif­i­cantly bet­ter, so long as bor­ders re­main closed and/or ar­rival quar­an­tines re­main in place.</p>
    <p>MR ALEXAN­DRE DE JU­NIAC, Iata di­rec­tor gen­eral, in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>ting, we still won’t have a fi­nan­cially sus­tain­able in­dus­try in 2021,” said Mr de Ju­niac, adding that 1.3 mil­lion jobs were at risk in the avi­a­tion in­dus­try alone, with po­ten­tial knockon ef­fects on mil­lions more.</p>
    <p>Nearly 200 Euro­pean air­ports also risk in­sol­vency in the com­ing months if pas­sen­ger traf­fic does not re­cover, a trade as­so­ci­a­tion warned on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Air­ports Coun­cil In­ter­na­tional (ACI) Europe said the 193 air­ports fac­ing in­sol­vency are mainly re­gional air­ports that serve lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>But com­bined, they sup­port more than a quar­ter of a mil­lion jobs and US$15.6 bil­lion in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>The trade as­so­ci­a­tion said: “The threat of air­port clo­sure means Europe faces the prospect of the col­lapse of a sig­nif­i­cant part of its air trans­port sys­tem – un­less govern­ments step up to pro­vide the re­quired sup­port.”</p>
    <p>A num­ber of Euro­pean na­tions have moved to pro­vide spe­cific help for air­lines in ad­di­tion to sup­port mea­sures of­fered to all com­pa­nies hit by pan­demic-re­lated re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>ACI Europe’s fig­ures show air­port pas­sen­ger traf­fic was down 75 per cent in the mid­dle of this month, which means air­ports – like air­lines – have trou­ble cov­er­ing op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>The trade body called on Euro­pean na­tions to shift to test­ing air pas­sen­gers for Covid-19 rather than im­pos­ing quar­an­tines on trav­ellers.</p>
