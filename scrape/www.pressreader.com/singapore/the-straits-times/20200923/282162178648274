    <p>There has been much dis­cus­sion on the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of cy­clists on pub­lic paths.</p>
    <p>Cy­cling is a great form of ex­er­cise and also helps re­duce one’s car­bon foot­print. Un­for­tu­nately, we are very far from ac­cept­ing cy­cling as part of our com­mute. Even some schools do not al­low cy­cling on their premises.</p>
    <p>Sadly, from the dis­cus­sions I have seen, it ap­pears that cy­cling is not wel­come both on paths and on the roads. Cy­clists are ac­cused of be­ing a haz­ard on paths and a nui­sance on the roads.</p>
    <p>Com­mon sense and pa­tience should be the or­der of the day.</p>
    <p>I have seen pedes­tri­ans walk­ing on cy­cling paths in­stead of foot­paths, not keep­ing to the left side of paths, drift­ing from one side to the other, and glued to their smart­phones.</p>
    <p>I have also seen cy­clists rid­ing abreast on a two-lane road on a busy work day and speed­ing on shared paths, and driv­ers not giv­ing way to cy­clists at junc­tions.</p>
    <p>All we need is com­mon sense. Work is on­go­ing over the code of con­duct for users of pub­lic paths and this has gen­er­ated a lot of dis­cus­sion. Per­haps the Gov­ern­ment could roll out a na­tional ed­u­ca­tion cam­paign.</p>
