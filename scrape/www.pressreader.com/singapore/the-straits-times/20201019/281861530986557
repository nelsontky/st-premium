    <p>•</p>
    <p>An Is­raeli del­e­ga­tion ac­com­pa­nied by US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steve Mnuchin ar­rived in Bahrain yes­ter­day to for­malise nascent ties and broaden the Gulf co­op­er­a­tion that Wash­ing­ton has pro­moted as an anti-Iran bul­wark and po­ten­tial eco­nomic bo­nanza.</p>
    <p>Bahrain fol­lowed the United Arab Emi­rates in agree­ing last month to nor­malise ties with Is­rael, stun­ning Pales­tini­ans who had de­manded state­hood be­fore any such re­gional rap­proche­ment.</p>
    <p>The break­through, over­seen by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, is a for­eign pol­icy flour­ish ahead of his re­elec­tion bid next month.</p>
    <p>For the US al­lies, it is a chance to close ranks on Iran more overtly.</p>
    <p>The Is­raeli del­e­ga­tion flew to Bahrain on an El Al Is­rael Air­lines char­ter flight from Ben Gu­rion Air­port in Tel Aviv.</p>
    <p>At a cer­e­mony with Mr Mnuchin be­fore take-off, US Mid­dle East en­voy Avi Berkowitz said that Is­rael and Bahrain would sign a joint com­mu­nique “bring­ing for­ward tourism and bank­ing and di­plo­matic re­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>Mr Mnuchin told re­porters on the flight: “I think the op­por­tu­nity is</p>
    <p>way be­yond just in­vest­ments. It’s in tech­nol­ogy, build­ing var­i­ous dif­fer­ent busi­nesses – and in the case of Bahrain as well, re­ally ex­pand­ing</p>
    <p>the op­por­tu­ni­ties for them quite, quite, quite dra­mat­i­cally.”</p>
    <p>Is­rael and Bahrain signed a “Dec­la­ra­tion of Peace, Co­op­er­a­tion and</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tive Di­plo­matic and Friendly Re­la­tions” at a White House cer­e­mony on Sept 15, a doc­u­ment that fell short of a for­mal treaty.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial in­volved in the visit said the com­mu­nique would up­grade the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Is­raeli Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Meir Ben-Shab­bat, speak­ing in Ara­bic at an ar­rival cer­e­mony at Manama air­port, said: “This is a great day... We look for­ward, in­shal­lah (God will­ing), to host­ing you in Is­rael soon.”</p>
    <p>Bahraini For­eign Min­is­ter Ab­dul­latif al-Zayani echoed the sen­ti­ments. “This ap­proach of en­gage­ment and co­op­er­a­tion is the most ef­fec­tive, the most sus­tain­able means to bring about a gen­uine and last­ing peace, one which safe­guards the rights of the Mid­dle East peo­ples,” he said.</p>
    <p>The sign­ing of the dec­la­ra­tion, how­ever, sparked anger among Bahrai­nis at home and abroad. Bahrain, where a Sunni Mus­lim-mi­nor­ity rules a Shi’ite-ma­jor­ity pop­u­la­tion, has said the deal pro­tects its in­ter­ests from Iran.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has been try­ing to se­cure more such deals for Is­rael ahead of the US elec­tion on Nov 3, and Mr Mnuchin said he hoped the process would con­tinue re­gard­less of who wins at the polls.</p>
    <p>El Al Flight 973, a nod to Bahrain’s tele­phone code, flew over Saudi Ara­bia, an ac­com­mo­da­tion by the Gulf pow­er­house that has so far re­sisted US ap­peals to nor­malise ties with Is­rael.</p>
    <p>Mr Mnuchin and the other Amer­i­can of­fi­cials travel today to the UAE, where the ac­cord with Is­rael has un­corked bi­lat­eral com­merce.</p>
    <p>To­mor­row, the US dig­ni­taries will join the UAE’s first del­e­ga­tion to Is­rael.</p>
    <p>A Bahraini source said that a pri­or­ity for Manama would be cy­ber se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion af­ter a de­cree is­sued by the King last week to set up a Na­tional Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Cen­tre, as well as tap­ping Is­rael’s ecosys­tem for busi­ness start-ups.</p>
