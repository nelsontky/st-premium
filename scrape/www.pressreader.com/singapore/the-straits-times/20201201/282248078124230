    <p>A set of best prac­tices for com­mod­ity fi­nanc­ing was rolled out yes­ter­day, the first such code for the in­dus­try in Sin­ga­pore. It comes af­ter the coun­try’s rep­u­ta­tion as a trusted hub for this lend­ing seg­ment took a hit lately.</p>
    <p>The code was launched by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore (ABS), with the sup­port of the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) and the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity (Acra).</p>
    <p>The ABS Code of Best Prac­tices for Com­mod­ity Fi­nanc­ing lays out key prin­ci­ples gov­ern­ing pru­dent com­mod­ity trade-fi­nanc­ing prac­tices. It pro­vides a bench­mark for banks’ lend­ing stan­dards in the sec­tor to make Sin­ga­pore more re­silient, rel­e­vant and com­pet­i­tive as a global com­mod­ity-trad­ing hub, ABS said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>One of the two key themes un­der­pin­ning the code is that, at a macro level, banks should un­der­stand traders’ cor­po­rate gov­er­nance, risk-man­age­ment prac­tices, busi­ness and trans­ac­tions through due dili­gence and pol­icy re­quire­ments. The other is that, at a trans­ac­tional level, banks should ob­tain suf­fi­cient trans­parency and con­trol over fi­nanced trans­ac­tions, goods and re­ceiv­ables.</p>
    <p>The code was de­vel­oped by an in­dus­try work­ing group of 28 banks, in con­sul­ta­tion with trad­ing com­pa­nies. Th­ese lenders – in­clud­ing DBS Bank, OCBC Bank, United Over­seas Bank, Bank of China, Citi, ABN Amro, BNP Paribas and So­ci­ete Gen­erale (SocGen) – rep­re­sent the ma­jor­ity of com­mod­ity-fi­nanc­ing banks in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Busi­ness Times (BT) had re­ported in July that banks with op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore had set up a work­ing group to pro­pose new guide­lines in a bid to raise in­dus­try stan­dards for com­mod­ity fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>ABS noted yes­ter­day that the code is de­signed to pro­vide broad guidance to banks, which are ex­pected to en­sure the ap­pro­pri­ate poli­cies, pro­ce­dures and con­trols are in place to ob­serve the prin­ci­ples in the best prac­tices in a riskpro­por­tion­ate man­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Sa­muel Tsien, ABS chair­man and OCBC group chief ex­ec­u­tive, said the code “en­sures a more ro­bust and dis­ci­plined fi­nanc­ing ap­proach to sup­port the growth of Sin­ga­pore’s thriv­ing com­mod­i­ty­trad­ing sec­tor”, which com­prises a broad range of par­tic­i­pants, from bou­tique firms to lead­ing in­ter­na­tional com­mod­ity groups.</p>
    <p>MAS as­sis­tant man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for bank­ing and in­sur­ance Ho Hern Shin ex­pects strong par­tic­i­pa­tion by the in­dus­try in im­ple­ment­ing the best prac­tices.</p>
    <p>This will en­cour­age greater trans­parency and trust be­tween trad­ing firms and their lenders, as well as pro­mote sus­tain­able credit flows, she said.</p>
    <p>The code also sets out a com­mon set of risk-man­age­ment con­sid­er­a­tions for par­tic­i­pants at the cen­tre of global trade. This will guide cred­i­tors and “pro­vide them com­fort” when fi­nanc­ing global trad­ing com­pa­nies, noted Mr Satvin­der Singh, ESG’s as­sis­tant CEO. He added that a di­verse range of com­mod­ity-trad­ing com­pa­nies pro­vided feed­back for the de­vel­op­ment of the code.</p>
    <p>Mr Andy Sim, Acra as­sis­tant CEO, le­gal ser­vices and com­pli­ance, sees the code as “a step in the right di­rec­tion” to boost cor­po­rate trans­parency and the trust be­tween banks and traders. “This will help to pro­mote ac­count­abil­ity and up­hold the in­tegrity of the com­mod­ity trad­ing sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>The com­mod­ity-trade fi­nance busi­ness has been rocked by scan­dals, in­clud­ing the high-pro­file col­lapse of oil trad­ing gi­ant Hin Leong, as well as struc­tural is­sues such as fall­ing prices and reg­u­la­tory pres­sures on prof­its.</p>
    <p>Some Euro­pean banks have pulled back from the seg­ment in Sin­ga­pore. Among those said to be shut­ting or scal­ing down their trade-fi­nance op­er­a­tions are SocGen, ABN Amro and BNP Paribas.</p>
    <p>BT also re­ported in Oc­to­ber that Sin­ga­pore is try­ing to bring greater trans­parency to the seg­ment, with other ini­tia­tives such as TradeTrust, an in­ter­op­er­abil­ity frame­work that con­nects plat­forms to ex­change dig­i­tal trade doc­u­men­ta­tion, as well as an up­com­ing proof-of-con­cept for a dig­i­tal trade-fi­nance reg­istry.</p>
