    <p>COPENHAGEN • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) yes­ter­day said it would con­vene its Euro­pean mem­bers to dis­cuss how to han­dle a new vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus dis­cov­ered in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO’s re­gional di­rec­tor for Europe, said on Twit­ter that the or­gan­i­sa­tion was mon­i­tor­ing the spread of the new vari­ant and would “con­vene mem­ber states to dis­cuss strate­gies for test­ing, re­duc­ing trans­mis­sion and com­mu­ni­cat­ing risks”, with­out spec­i­fy­ing a time­frame.</p>
    <p>WHO emer­gen­cies chief Michael Ryan tried to tem­per the alarm by stress­ing that the sit­u­a­tion was not “out of con­trol”, shortly af­ter a Bri­tish min­is­ter used those ex­act words to de­scribe the spread of the vari­ant.</p>
    <p>Europe is scram­bling to thrash out a co­or­di­nated re­sponse to the new strain of the coro­n­avirus that causes Covid-19. With trav­ellers in Europe fac­ing a night­mare hol­i­day sea­son, Euro­pean Union am­bas­sadors were set to meet yes­ter­day to try to nail down a uni­fied ap­proach and work out how to even­tu­ally lift bor­der restrictio­ns with Bri­tain – in­clud­ing by im­pos­ing a rule for tests on all ar­rivals.</p>
    <p>The WHO’s Euro­pean re­gion com­prises 53 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Rus­sia and sev­eral Cen­tral Asian na­tions. The re­gion has reg­is­tered nearly 24 mil­lion Covid-19 cases and more than 500,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Dr Kluge said “lim­it­ing travel to con­tain the spread is pru­dent un­til we have bet­ter info”, but cau­tioned that “sup­ply chains for es­sen­tial goods and es­sen­tial travel should re­main pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, WHO Europe urged stronger ac­tion to con­tain the new strain and called on mem­bers to “in­crease the se­quenc­ing of Sars-CoV-2 viruses where pos­si­ble and shar­ing of se­quence data in­ter­na­tion­ally, in par­tic­u­lar, to re­port if the same mu­ta­tions of con­cern are found”.</p>
    <p>The strain in Bri­tain has also been de­tected in small num­bers in Aus­tralia, Den­mark and the Nether­lands, WHO said. An­other vari­ant with sim­i­lar ge­netic mu­ta­tions has been linked to wide­spread trans­mis­sion in South Africa.</p>
    <p>Dozens of coun­tries – from Ar­gentina to In­dia – have banned flights from Bri­tain in fear of the new strain which is re­port­edly 70 per cent more con­ta­gious.</p>
    <p>The United States gov­ern­ment is con­sid­er­ing re­quir­ing that all pas­sen­gers trav­el­ling from Bri­tain re­ceive a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test within 72 hours of de­par­ture as a con­di­tion of en­try, said air­line and US of­fi­cials on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the WHO, there is cur­rently “no ev­i­dence to indi­cate any change in dis­ease sever­ity”.</p>
    <p>Con­cern over the mu­tated strain sent Euro­pean stocks, oil prices and the Bri­tish pound plung­ing, while changes in trans­port un­leashed chaos for trav­ellers and truck­ers ahead of Christ­mas.</p>
