    <p>While tech­nol­ogy mis­use can lead to the theft of mil­lions with a few key­strokes, up­dated tech­nol­ogy has also helped pros­e­cu­tors find the prover­bial nee­dle in the haystack, or dig­i­tal ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to stay­ing abreast of cut­ting-edge tech­nol­ogy, pros­e­cu­tors in the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) have, in com­plex cases, part­nered en­force­ment col­leagues at a very early stage of in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“This has been done in nu­mer­ous cases such as, most re­cently, in the Hin Leong case where pros­e­cu­tion was in­sti­tuted in a much shorter than usual time for cases of such scale and com­plex­ity,” an AGC spokesman told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, ty­coon Lim Oon Kuin, founder and chair­man of oil trader Hin Leong Trad­ing, was charged with abet­ment of forgery for the pur­pose of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>The AGC spokesman said crimes of such com­plex­ity typ­i­cally take time to in­ves­ti­gate.</p>
    <p>“We have, how­ever, been able to sig­nif­i­cantly shorten the time re­quired to bring forth pros­e­cu­tion by lever­ag­ing tech­nol­ogy and our close part­ner­ship with law en­force­ment agen­cies such as the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment and Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau, as well as the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore,” she said.</p>
    <p>These agen­cies and AGC’s crime di­vi­sion use tech­nol­ogy to process and search vo­lu­mi­nous amounts of data, some­times hun­dreds of thou­sands of files, quickly.</p>
    <p>“In some cases, we have seen first-hand how tech­nol­ogy helped us find the nee­dle in the haystack,” the spokesman said, adding that the of­fice strives to stay abreast of cut­ting-edge tech for this rea­son.</p>
    <p>Other com­plex cases on which AGC and its law en­force­ment col­leagues have worked on in­clude mat­ters in­volv­ing 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) and the Wire­card scan­dal.</p>
    <p>The 1MDB scan­dal was de­scribed as Sin­ga­pore’s largest and most com­plex money-laun­der­ing case, with United States of­fi­cials al­leg­ing that US$3.5 bil­lion (S$4.75 bil­lion) was miss­ing from the Malaysian state fund. Two Swiss pri­vate banks here were or­dered shut, and as­sets were seized, among other things.</p>
    <p>In re­la­tion to the Wire­card case, a Sin­ga­porean com­pany di­rec­tor was charged ear­lier this month with fraud af­ter al­legedly fal­si­fy­ing let­ters from his firm, Ci­tadelle Cor­po­rate Ser­vices, to Wire­card, mak­ing out that the firm held tens of mil­lions in euros in es­crow ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Wire­card, the Ger­man dig­i­tal pay­ment com­pany, had sought bank­ruptcy in June.</p>
    <p>White-col­lar crimes fall broadly into three groups: fraud/cheat­ing/crim­i­nal breach of trust, se­cu­ri­ties-re­lated of­fences and cor­rup­tion/bribery.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the in­crease in cross-border fi­nan­cial crimes over the years, the spokesman said AGC and its law en­force­ment part­ners have worked closely with coun­ter­parts in many coun­tries, in­clud­ing Bri­tain, Switzer­land and Malaysia, to share in­for­ma­tion and trace, seize or repa­tri­ate funds.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, we have worked with the French au­thor­i­ties in seiz­ing more than US$10 mil­lion in the case in­volv­ing Steep Rise Limited.”</p>
    <p>SPEED­ING THINGS UP</p>
    <p>This has been done in nu­mer­ous cases such as, most re­cently, in the Hin Leong case where pros­e­cu­tion was in­sti­tuted in a much shorter than usual time for cases of such ’’ scale and com­plex­ity.</p>
    <p>A SPOKESMAN FOR THE AT­TOR­NEY-GEN­ERAL’S CHAM­BERS.</p>
    <p>The move came af­ter the French au­thor­i­ties prob­ing fraud and money laun­der­ing in France de­tected sus­pi­cious trans­fers of money into bank ac­counts in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>AGC has also so far repa­tri­ated about $50 mil­lion to Malaysia in re­la­tion to 1MDB. “In this re­gard, one of our pri­mary ob­jec­tives is to pro­tect Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion and po­si­tion as a clean and trusted in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial hub, and one of the few ju­ris­dic­tions in the world that have cor­rup­tion ef­fec­tively un­der con­trol,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try sources see the whitecol­lar crime chal­lenge as an on­go­ing tus­sle where tech­nol­ogy can help out­pace po­ten­tial per­pe­tra­tors.</p>
    <p>“The key to ef­fec­tive pros­e­cu­tion is gath­er­ing solid ev­i­dence. Tech­nol­ogy helps a lot to gather that ev­i­dence, but in­tel­li­gence work is equally im­por­tant,” said Mr Sam Vi­jaya, di­rec­tor of Global Over­sight Solutions, a com­pli­ance, ethics and in­ves­tiga­tive con­sul­tancy.</p>
