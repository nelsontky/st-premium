    <p>WASH­ING­TON • A health­care worker in Alaska who had a se­ri­ous al­ler­gic re­ac­tion af­ter be­ing in­jected with Pfizer’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine has re­cov­ered af­ter an overnight stay in hospi­tal, but the in­ci­dent has in­ten­si­fied con­cerns about the vac­cine’s side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>The mid­dle-aged worker had no history of al­ler­gies but had an ana­phy­lac­tic re­ac­tion that be­gan 10 min­utes af­ter re­ceiv­ing the vac­cine on Tues­day at Bartlett Re­gional Hospi­tal in Juneau, Alaska, a hospi­tal of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>She ex­pe­ri­enced a rash over her face and torso, short­ness of breath and an el­e­vated heart rate.</p>
    <p>Dr Lindy Jones, the hospi­tal’s emer­gency de­part­ment med­i­cal di­rec­tor, said the worker was first given a shot of ep­i­neph­rine, a stan­dard treat­ment for se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions. Her symp­toms sub­sided but then re-emerged, and she was treated with steroids and an ep­i­neph­rine drip.</p>
    <p>When doc­tors tried to stop the drip, her symp­toms re-emerged, so she was moved to the in­ten­sive care unit, ob­served through­out the night, then weaned off the drip early on Wed­nes­day, Dr Jones said.</p>
    <p>He said the woman felt well, re­mained en­thu­si­as­tic about the vac­cine and was set to be dis­charged later on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“She is healthy and she is do­ing well,” Dr Jones said.</p>
    <p>Although the Pfizer vac­cine was shown to be safe and about 95 per cent ef­fec­tive in a clin­i­cal trial in­volv­ing 44,000 par­tic­i­pants, the Alaska case will likely in­ten­sify con­cerns about pos­si­ble side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts de­scribed the woman’s symp­toms as po­ten­tially lifethreat­en­ing and said they may prompt calls for tighter guide­lines to en­sure re­cip­i­ents are care­fully mon­i­tored for ad­verse re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials were scram­bling on Wed­nes­day to learn more about the case, ac­cord­ing to three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with their re­sponse. With mil­lions of Amer­i­cans ex­pected to be vac­ci­nated by the end of the year, the in­ci­dent is likely to prompt fed­eral of­fi­cials to be even more watch­ful for any sign of se­ri­ous side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>The Alaska woman’s re­ac­tion was be­lieved to be sim­i­lar to the ana­phy­lac­tic re­ac­tions two health work­ers in Bri­tain ex­pe­ri­enced af­ter re­ceiv­ing the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine last week. Both of them re­cov­ered. The re­ac­tion was likely to be dis­cussed yes­ter­day, when Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion sci­en­tists were sched­uled to meet an out­side panel of ex­perts to eval­u­ate Moderna’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine, which uses the same kind of tech­nol­ogy as Pfizer’s.</p>
    <p>Although the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cines are sim­i­lar in in­gre­di­ents, it is not clear whether an al­ler­gic re­ac­tion to one would oc­cur with the other.</p>
    <p>Both con­sist of ge­netic ma­te­rial called mRNA en­cased in a bub­ble made from a mix­ture of fats.</p>
    <p>The two com­pa­nies use dif­fer­ent fats. Pfizer’s trial in the United States in­volv­ing more than 40,000 peo­ple did not find any se­ri­ous ad­verse events caused by the vac­cine, although many par­tic­i­pants did ex­pe­ri­ence aches, fevers and other side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions to vac­cines are typ­i­cally linked to the vac­cine be­cause of their tim­ing.</p>
    <p>A Pfizer spokesman, Ms Jer­ica Pitts, said the com­pany does not yet have all the de­tails of the Alaska case, but is work­ing with the lo­cal health au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine comes with in­for­ma­tion warn­ing that med­i­cal treat­ment should be avail­able in case of a rare ana­phy­lac­tic event, she said.</p>
    <p>“We will closely mon­i­tor all re­ports sug­ges­tive of se­ri­ous al­ler­gic re­ac­tions fol­low­ing vac­ci­na­tion and up­date la­belling lan­guage if needed,” she added.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the work­ers in Bri­tain fell ill, the au­thor­i­ties there ini­tially warned against giv­ing the vac­cines to any­one with a history of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>They later clar­i­fied their con­cerns, chang­ing the word­ing from “se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions” to spec­ify that the vac­cine should not be given to any­one who has ever had an ana­phy­lac­tic re­ac­tion to a food, medicine or vac­cine.</p>
    <p>That type of re­ac­tion to a vac­cine is “very rare”, they said.</p>
    <p>Pfizer of­fi­cials have said the two peo­ple in Bri­tain who ex­pe­ri­enced the re­ac­tion had a history of se­vere al­ler­gies.</p>
    <p>In the US, fed­eral reg­u­la­tors last Fri­day is­sued a broad au­tho­ri­sa­tion for the vac­cine to be given to adults 16 years and older.</p>
    <p>Health­care providers were warned not to give the vac­cine to any­one with a “known history of a se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tion” to any com­po­nent of the vac­cine, which they said was a stan­dard warn­ing for vac­cines.</p>
