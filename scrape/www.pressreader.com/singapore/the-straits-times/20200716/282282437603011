    <p>(+358.49) July 15 (+556.79) July 14</p>
    <p>Amid mixed sen­ti­ment across the re­gion and a som­bre kick-off to the sec­ond-quar­ter re­port­ing sea­son in the United States, the lo­cal mar­ket bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) ended yes­ter­day at 2,648.90, up 28.71 points, or 1.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Only four of the STI’s 30 com­po­nent stocks were down for the day.</p>
    <p>Among the key gain­ers were the lead­ing prop­erty coun­ters – UOL Group, City De­vel­op­ments (CDL) and Cap­i­taLand, which ended the day up 2.96 per cent, 2.66 per cent and 2.11 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>While the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic does not bode well for res­i­den­tial prop­erty sales, ho­tel oc­cu­pancy rates or com­mer­cial rents, these stocks are widely seen by an­a­lysts to still of­fer de­cent value for long-term in­vestors.</p>
    <p>In fact, OCBC Bank In­vest­ment Re­search said yes­ter­day that it is main­tain­ing its rec­om­men­da­tion to buy shares in CDL, which re­cently warned that its first-half pre-tax profit would be sub­stan­tially lower than last year’s.</p>
    <p>The re­search house sees “deep value” in the stock, even though it has cut its fair value for the counter to $10.74 from $12.01 pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Sen­ti­ment was not all that pos­i­tive across the broader mar­ket though, with ad­vancers out­num­ber­ing de­clin­ers by only 251 to 226.</p>
    <p>Many health­care and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal plays that have seen heavy trading re­cently ended the day lower.</p>
    <p>Among them were iX Bio­pharma and Hyphens Pharma In­ter­na­tional, which ended the day down 9.52 per cent and 12.5 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Around the re­gion, the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex was down 1.56 per cent, while the Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex ended the day 0.01 per cent higher. South Korea’s Kospi In­dex was 0.84 per cent higher.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, the key mar­ket bench­marks for Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were down 0.82 per cent and 0.07 per cent, re­spec­tively, while Bangkok’s main barom­e­ter was up 0.99 per cent.</p>
    <p>In the US, the S&P 500 In­dex charted an overnight gain of 1.34 per cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while the re­ac­tion to the earn­ings re­ports of ma­jor US banks such as JP Mor­gan and Wells Fargo was mixed, their man­age­ments warned of a tough op­er­at­ing out­look ahead.</p>
    <p>Schroders chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer and global head of multi-as­set in­vest­ment Jo­hanna Kyrk­lund said in a re­search note: “As we head to­wards the au­tumn, com­pla­cent in­vestors may get a wake-up call.</p>
    <p>“The fur­lough­ing of staff may be mask­ing some of the neg­a­tive ef­fects of the lock­down, and as fur­lough mea­sures are re­moved, job losses are likely to ac­cel­er­ate.”</p>
