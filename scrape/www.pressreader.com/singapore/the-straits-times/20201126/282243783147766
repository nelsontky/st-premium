    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC) has asked doc­tors to re­frain from join­ing re­view sites they can pay to help cre­ate con­tent to make their pro­files more vis­i­ble on search engines. This comes in the wake of a group of doc­tors cry­ing foul over not hav­ing the op­tion to pull out of Doc­torxDen­tist (DxD), a plat­form that car­ries health con­tent, re­views and rat­ings of doc­tors.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion (SMA) stepped in to pres­sure the site to delist the names.</p>
    <p>SMC and the Health Min­istry also got in­volved in a meet­ing that was held be­tween the three bod­ies and DxD on Nov 13.</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, DxD started to re­move thou­sands of doc­tor list­ings from the site, keep­ing only the names of doc­tors it was ac­tively work­ing with. When con­tacted, DxD gen­eral man­ager Tyr As­taroth Ding said all the re­views were re­moved last night.</p>
    <p>SMC sent an ad­vi­sory to med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers yes­ter­day even­ing say­ing they should re­frain from par­tic­i­pat­ing in on­line search en­gine op­ti­mi­sa­tion plat­forms that make use of pa­tient feed­back and rat­ings, as these can be con­sid­ered pa­tient tes­ti­mo­ni­als, which are for­bid­den un­der the SMC eth­i­cal code and eth­i­cal guide­lines.</p>
    <p>SMA’s first vice-pres­i­dent Ng Chee Kwan said: “SMA is ap­pre­cia­tive that SMC has clar­i­fied the man­ner in which doc­tors can ad­ver­tise, and that ad­ver­tis­ing that makes use of pa­tient feed­back, rat­ings or tes­ti­mo­ni­als is not al­lowed. This will help doc­tors to de­cide which plat­forms they can­not par­tic­i­pate in.”</p>
    <p>The SMC ad­vi­sory listed a few points from its hand­book on med­i­cal ethics. Some of them are:</p>
    <p>• Sub­jec­tive praise and com­pli­ments about you or your ser­vices have no place in med­i­cal ad­ver­tis­ing. Tes­ti­mo­ni­als are sub­jec­tive and not al­lowed to be used in ad­ver­tis­ing on any me­dia where you have any con­trol over the con­tent about your­self.</p>
    <p>• Pa­tient tes­ti­mo­ni­als, even if gen­uine, are dis­al­lowed be­cause any num­ber of tes­ti­mo­ni­als can­not present the whole pic­ture of your prac­tice ac­cu­rately or truth­fully, and be­cause these may not be rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the col­lec­tive views of your pa­tients.</p>
    <p>• Tes­ti­mo­ni­als by fa­mous per­sons or celebri­ties would, in ad­di­tion, be deemed sen­sa­tional.</p>
    <p>SMC also said prac­ti­tion­ers should not buy pack­ages from such plat­forms for the pur­pose of ob­tain­ing tes­ti­mo­ni­als. Pay­ment for such pack­ages or ser­vices could be con­sid­ered to be ex­press agree­ment on the part of prac­ti­tion­ers to al­low tes­ti­mo­ni­als to be part of their pub­lic­ity and ad­ver­tise­ment ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
