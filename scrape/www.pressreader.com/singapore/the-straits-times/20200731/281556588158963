    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia of­fi­cially re­sumed the cross-bor­der Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS) Link be­tween Wood­lands and Jo­hor Baru with a cer­e­mony to mark the oc­ca­sion, one day ahead of a fi­nal dead­line fol­low­ing mul­ti­ple post­pone­ments to the pro­ject. The RTS will now be a light rail tran­sit sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia of­fi­cially re­sumed the pro­ject for the cross­bor­der Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS) Link be­tween Wood­lands and Jo­hor Baru with a cer­e­mony to mark the oc­ca­sion, one day ahead of a fi­nal dead­line fol­low­ing mul­ti­ple post­pone­ments.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, it will get rolling later than planned – ser­vice is tar­geted to start end-2026 – with sev­eral changes wo­ven in. The RTS, for ex­am­ple, will now be a light rail tran­sit (LRT) sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day evening that the RTS Link would im­prove con­nec­tiv­ity and ease con­ges­tion along the Cause­way when it is ready.</p>
    <p>“So it was apt that we marked this mile­stone with a bi­lat­eral cer­e­mony at the Cause­way, which has con­nected our two coun­tries for al­most a hun­dred years.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee, along with Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, wit­nessed the cer­e­mony at which Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung and his Malaysian coun­ter­part Wee Ka Siong marked the of­fi­cial re­sump­tion of the pro­ject.</p>
    <p>The 4km line, pre­vi­ously slated to be op­er­a­tional by end-2024, will con­nect pas­sen­gers be­tween Jo­hor’s Bukit Cha­gar ter­mi­nus sta­tion and the Sin­ga­pore ter­mi­nus in Wood­lands North. The Cus­toms, im­mi­gra­tion and quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties will be co-lo­cated so pas­sen­gers have to clear im­mi­gra­tion only once, at the point of de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries also reaf­firmed their com­mit­ment to en­sur­ing the rail link is well-in­te­grated with lo­cal trans­port net­works. The Sin­ga­pore ter­mi­nus is at Wood­lands North on the Thom­son-East Coast (TEL) MRT Line, which will serve 32 sta­tions from Wood­lands to Be­dok by 2024.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral key changes have been made to the pro­ject.</p>
    <p>The RTS Link will now be a stand­alone LRT sys­tem, in­stead of us­ing the same trains and sys­tems as Sin­ga­pore’s TEL. As a re­sult, the RTS Link will no longer use the ex­ist­ing</p>
    <p>TEL de­pot at Mandai. A new de­pot will be built in Wadi Hana, Jo­hor Baru. The cross-bor­der link’s ca­pac­ity re­mains un­changed at up to 10,000 pas­sen­gers per hour in each di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Min­istry of Trans­port said that the pro­ject would use an LRT sys­tem sim­i­lar to that of a medium-ca­pac­ity MRT sys­tem in Sin­ga­pore and it would be ca­pa­ble of meet­ing the peak ca­pac­ity of 10,000 pas­sen­gers an hour, in each di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Malaysia has changed its in­fra­struc­ture com­pany (In­fraCo) to a wholly owned sub­sidiary of Mass Rapid Tran­sit Cor­po­ra­tion. The Land Trans­port Author­ity re­mains as Sin­ga­pore’s In­fraCo.</p>
    <p>The rail link is ex­pected to bring re­lief to the Cause­way, which 300,000 peo­ple used to cross daily be­fore the pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>The sign­ing turns the page on a pro­ject which was agreed to by leaders of both coun­tries a decade ago, but has seen sev­eral de­lays.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries signed a bind­ing agree­ment to build the link in Jan­uary 2018, but key pro­ject dead­lines were missed after the Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion led by for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad came to power in Malaysia less than five months later.</p>
    <p>The dead­line to come to new terms was sub­se­quently pushed back four times at the re­quest of Malaysia. The last sus­pen­sion, to the end of this month, was due to fac­tors such as Covid-19 and Malaysia’s change of govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Asked if he was con­fi­dent that the RTS Link would be­gin fer­ry­ing com­muters by 2026, Mr Ong said: “We work with what­ever govern­ment is in charge and we also, as a coun­try, deeply re­spect and abide by the agree­ments (we sign) and I’m sure our part­ner coun­tries are the same.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee said in his Face­book post: “The pan­demic has shown how deeply en­twined our two coun­tries are. Even in these dif­fi­cult times, we con­tinue to work to­gether, and look for­ward to do­ing still more to­gether.”</p>
    <p>It was apt that we marked this mile­stone with a bi­lat­eral cer­e­mony at the Cause­way, which has con­nected our two coun­tries for al­most a hun­dred years. The pan­demic has shown how deeply en­twined our two coun­tries are. Even in these dif­fi­cult times, we con­tinue to work to­gether, and look for­ward to do­ing still more to­gether. ’’</p>
    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER LEE HSIEN LOONG, in a Face­book post, re­fer­ring to the RTS Link.</p>
    <p>The move to switch to a Light Rapid Tran­sit (LRT) sys­tem for the cross-bor­der link be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia was made to save on costs, even after fac­tor­ing in the build­ing of a new train de­pot in Malaysia, said trans­port ex­perts.</p>
    <p>In of­fi­cially re­sum­ing the Jo­hor Baru-Sin­ga­pore Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS) Link yes­ter­day, both coun­tries had an­nounced it would adopt an LRT sys­tem in­stead of us­ing the same trains and rail sys­tems as Sin­ga­pore’s Thom­son-East Coast MRT Line (TEL).</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) trans­port re­searcher Lee Der-Horng said the most sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ence be­tween Malaysia’s LRT sys­tem and the TEL is the rolling stock, or type of train, used.</p>
    <p>He said: “Even though build­ing a new de­pot adds to the cost of the pro­ject, the cost sav­ing from the smaller trains could com­pen­sate for the ex­pense, and the op­er­a­tion cost can also be less.”</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries had an­nounced that the RTS Link will no longer use the ex­ist­ing TEL Mandai De­pot, with a new de­pot to be built in Wadi Hana, Jo­hor Baru.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) spokesman yes­ter­day said the LRT sys­tem will be sim­i­lar to a medium-ca­pac­ity MRT line in Sin­ga­pore, like the up­com­ing Jurong Re­gion Line.</p>
    <p>She added that based on the LRT sys­tem’s max­i­mum ca­pac­ity of 10,000 pas­sen­gers an hour in each di­rec­tion – the same as the TEL sys­tem – the fre­quency of trains could be be­tween four and six min­utes. A one-way jour­ney will take about five min­utes.</p>
    <p>She also con­firmed that there will be no light main­te­nance fa­cil­ity in Bukit Cha­gar as was ini­tially planned, or in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity trans­port econ­o­mist Ter­ence Fan noted that an MRT sys­tem is more costly in terms of ini­tial in­vest­ment and the to­tal op­er­at­ing cost per year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences trans­port re­searcher Park Byung Joon made the point that Malaysia’s LRT sys­tem was not the best way to deal with a high vol­ume of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“If the de­mand re­mains l ow, such as a few thou­sand com­muters a day, then the LRT sys­tem is the wiser choice,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If the ex­pected vol­ume hits close to the max­i­mum ca­pac­ity ev­ery day, then there might be a con­cern that the over­all cost might go up due to wear and tear.”</p>
    <p>The cost of the pro­ject was a key rea­son for its de­lay. Last Novem­ber, Malaysia pro­posed amend­ing the scope and struc­ture of the pro­ject to cut costs by 36 per cent.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts agree that hav­ing the de­pot in Malaysia in­stead of Sin­ga­pore would mean lower costs, in­clud­ing land ac­qui­si­tion and labour costs.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Lee said hav­ing a new de­pot in Wadi Hana could be the most fea­si­ble so­lu­tion. As the RTS Link will have dif­fer­ent rolling stock from the TEL, the op­er­a­tion sys­tem would be in­com­pat­i­ble with it in terms of the sig­nalling and power sys­tems, he said.</p>
    <p>In terms of com­muter ex­pe­ri­ence, As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Ray­mond Ong from NUS said some peo­ple might have the mis­con­cep­tion that the LRT sys­tem the RTS will use is sim­i­lar to the Bukit Pan­jang LRT, which is much smaller than the MRT and has been sad­dled with re­li­a­bil­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>The LRT used in the RTS Link should be sim­i­lar to the LRT sys­tem used in the Am­pang Line in Klang Val­ley, said Prof Ong. This has a sim­i­lar ca­pac­ity to the Thom­son-East Coast Line, but runs at a slower speed.</p>
    <p>The line is now slated to be­gin op­er­at­ing by end-2026, in­stead of by the end of 2024.</p>
