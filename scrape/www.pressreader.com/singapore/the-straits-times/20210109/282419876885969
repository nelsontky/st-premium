    <p>SEOUL Hyundai Mo­tor backed away from a state­ment con­firm­ing it is in talks with Ap­ple on de­vel­op­ing self-driv­ing cars that fu­elled an US$8 bil­lion (S$10.6 bil­lion) surge in the Korean car­maker’s mar­ket value yes­ter­day, say­ing in­stead that it re­ceived re­quests for po­ten­tial co­op­er­a­tion from a num­ber of firms.</p>
    <p>Re­vis­ing its state­ment for a sec­ond time in a mat­ter of hours, the South Korean car­maker said it has been con­tacted by po­ten­tial part­ners for the devel­op­ment of au­ton­o­mous elec­tric ve­hi­cles, re­mov­ing any ref­er­ence to Ap­ple.</p>
    <p>Shares of Hyundai surged 19 per cent, only slightly par­ing their gains af­ter the state­ment con­firm­ing dis­cus­sions was re­vised.</p>
    <p>The stock surge had ear­lier boosted the com­bined for­tune of Hyundai chair­man Euisun Chung and his fa­ther Chung Mong-koo by al­most US$2 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires Index.</p>
    <p>By ini­tially nam­ing Ap­ple, Hyundai risks the ire of the tech­nol­ogy gi­ant known for its se­cre­tive­ness when it comes to new prod­ucts and part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>With devel­op­ment work still at an early stage, Ap­ple will take at least half a decade to launch an au­ton­o­mous elec­tric ve­hi­cle, peo­ple with knowl­edge of the ef­forts said. That sug­gests the com­pany is in no hurry to de­cide on po­ten­tial car in­dus­try part­ners.</p>
    <p>Hyundai’s in­tra­day stock jump in Seoul was the big­gest since 1988.</p>
    <p>A ca­ble TV unit of Korea Eco­nomic Daily ear­lier re­ported the dis­cus­sions with Ap­ple. Hyundai has com­pleted in­ter­nal talks on the project and is await­ing ap­proval from the chair­man, ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the re­port, Hyundai ini­tially is­sued a state­ment say­ing it is one of var­i­ous car­mak­ers that Ap­ple has been in early con­tact with.</p>
    <p>It re­vised its state­ment less than 30 min­utes later, re­mov­ing the ref­er­ence to other car­mak­ers. A few hours af­ter that, it is­sued an­other re­vi­sion that omit­ted Ap­ple.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been re­ceiv­ing re­quests for po­ten­tial co­op­er­a­tion from var­i­ous com­pa­nies re­gard­ing devel­op­ment of au­ton­o­mous EVs (elec­tric ve­hi­cles),” Hyundai said. “No de­ci­sions have been made as dis­cus­sions are in early stage.”</p>
    <p>Ap­ple de­clined to com­ment. It is no­to­ri­ously se­cre­tive with em­ploy­ees and sup­pli­ers. In 2018, it warned work­ers to stop leak­ing in­ter­nal in­for­ma­tion on fu­ture plans and raised the spec­tre of po­ten­tial le­gal ac­tion and crim­i­nal charges.</p>
    <p>An Ap­ple car would ri­val elec­tric ve­hi­cles from Tesla and of­fer­ings from firms such as up­start Lu­cid Mo­tors and es­tab­lished man­u­fac­tur­ers like Daim­ler and Volk­swa­gen.</p>
    <p>Set­ting up a car plant can cost bil­lions of dol­lars and take years, likely the rea­son why Ap­ple is talk­ing to po­ten­tial man­u­fac­tur­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>“Ap­ple needs to part­ner a car­maker be­cause it doesn’t have pro­duc­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties and sales net­works to sell its cars,” said an­a­lyst Lee Han-joon of KTB In­vest­ment and Se­cu­ri­ties in Seoul. “Build­ing up those ca­pa­bil­i­ties can’t be done quickly so Ap­ple will need a part­ner for that.”</p>
    <p>Bending metal is also a low­er­mar­gin busi­ness than pro­vid­ing the soft­ware, chips and sen­sors that fu­ture cars will rely on.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple has con­tin­ued to in­ves­ti­gate build­ing its self-driv­ing car sys­tem for a third-party car part­ner rather than its own ve­hi­cle, the peo­ple fa­mil­iar have said, and the com­pany could ul­ti­mately aban­don its own car ef­forts in favour of this ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Other tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies ex­pand­ing to au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles have also sought part­ner­ships. Al­pha­bet’s self-driv­ing unit Waymo has worked with Chrysler, while Ama­zon.com has tapped Ri­vian Au­to­mo­tive for co­op­er­a­tion over de­liv­ery vans.</p>
