    <p>Those be­low the age of 16 will not be get­ting the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion any time soon be­cause not enough is known about the side ef­fects for this group. Chil­dren and young peo­ple have a much lower risk of con­tract­ing the virus, and stud­ies have shown that they are less likely to be ac­tive spread­ers of it too. Here is what we know so far:</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Why are younger chil­dren less likely to be in­fected with Covid-19 com­pared with older chil­dren?</p>
    <p>A There are many pos­si­ble rea­sons for this.</p>
    <p>Dr Yung Chee Fu, con­sul­tant at the KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal’s (KKH) in­fec­tious dis­eases ser­vice, said that one pos­si­ble ex­pla­na­tion could be a lower ex­pres­sion of the an­giotensin-con­vert­ing en­zyme 2 (ACE2) re­cep­tors in younger chil­dren. Th­ese en­zyme re­cep­tors are the Sars-CoV-2 virus’ en­try points into body cells.</p>
    <p>There­fore, younger chil­dren up to the age of four had the low­est rates of in­fec­tion at 1.3 per cent, ac­cord­ing to a study con­ducted by KKH among 137 house­holds between March and April last year.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Paul Tam­byah, se­nior con­sul­tant at the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal, said that for chil­dren, ex­po­sure to mul­ti­ple com­mon colds at dif­fer­ent ages could con­fer pro­tec­tion from sea­sonal coro­n­aviruses such as Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Young chil­dren get colds all the time, so when they are in early pri­mary school, they have an­ti­bod­ies which pro­tect them from get­ting colds as of­ten as they used to in kinder­garten or nurs­ery.</p>
    <p>“Some of those an­ti­bod­ies may pro­tect them from in­fec­tions from the Sars-CoV-2 virus, and this may ex­plain why young chil­dren don’t get se­vere Covid-19. It is also pos­si­ble that th­ese an­ti­bod­ies may de­cline with time, which is per­haps why older peo­ple are more vul­ner­a­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the mat­u­ra­tion of one’s im­mune cells at dif­fer­ent ages could lead to dif­fer­ences in im­mune re­sponse to the virus.</p>
    <p>Q What kind of treat­ment is pro­vided to chil­dren who have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19?</p>
    <p>A Dr Mo­hana Ra­jaku­len­dran, a pae­di­a­tri­cian at the Park­way East Hospi­tal, said that as the ma­jor­ity of chil­dren who are pos­i­tive for Covid-19 have mild symp­toms, their symp­toms are treated with fever, cough or cold med­i­ca­tions. They are closely mon­i­tored for com­pli­ca­tions such as pneu­mo­nia, which may re­quire oxy­gen sup­port, or poor feed­ing which may re­quire in­tra­venous fluid sup­port.</p>
    <p>So far, there have been no re­ported child cases of Kawasaki dis­ease as­so­ci­ated with Covid-19, which is a se­vere form of in­flam­ma­tory dis­ease caused by an over­re­ac­tion of one’s im­mune sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Q With the two con­firmed Raf­fles Girls’ School stu­dent cases, should we be wary of a pos­si­ble school-re­lated out­break?</p>
    <p>A School-re­lated out­breaks in Sin­ga­pore are un­likely, given that the chil­dren’s abil­ity to in­fect oth­ers and their abil­ity to be in­fected are rel­a­tively low. In ad­di­tion, safe man­age­ment mea­sures in schools such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing, com­pul­sory mask-wear­ing and tem­per­a­ture tak­ing can also help to pre­vent the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>KKH’s study of 137 house­holds ex­posed to Covid-19 found that there were 13 con­firmed cases of Covid-19 among chil­dren, re­veal­ing an adult-to-child trans­mis­sion rate of around 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Prof Tam­byah said: “Un­like with in­fluenza, chil­dren are un­likely to be the main driv­ers of in­fec­tion. There may be some silent trans­mis­sion from asymp­to­matic chil­dren, but this is likely to be in­signif­i­cant in the big pic­ture.</p>
    <p>“As such, in­fec­tion con­trol ef­forts in pre-schools and pri­mary schools could po­ten­tially be more re­laxed than in ter­tiary set­tings – if the cur­rent data can be val­i­dated in large prospec­tive stud­ies.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, an Ice­landic study pub­lished by the Na­tional Ge­o­graphic on Dec 10 found that chil­dren un­der the age of 15 were around half as likely as adults to be in­fected and to trans­mit the virus to oth­ers. It also found that al­most all the coron­avirus trans­mis­sions to chil­dren came from adults.</p>
    <p>The find­ings were con­sis­tent with the sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore, where chil­dren who were asymp­to­matic but tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 were of­ten house­hold con­tacts of in­fected adult fam­ily mem­bers. The chil­dren were swabbed as part of con­tact trac­ing mea­sures and were not iden­ti­fied as in­dex cases for spread.</p>
    <p>Q Given that most of the chil­dren who had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 ex­hib­ited mild symp­toms or were asymp­to­matic, what are the wider im­pli­ca­tions for in­fec­tion con­trol?</p>
    <p>A Tak­ing all the ev­i­dence into ac­count, Prof Tam­byah said that Covid-19 vac­cines should be tar­geted at adults in­stead of chil­dren be­cause adults are more likely to be the pri­mary trans­mis­sion driv­ers.</p>
    <p>Screen­ing chil­dren for symp­toms when they are com­ing into con­tact with vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple such as the el­derly should also fo­cus on their house­hold con­tacts.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if a chil­dren’s group is go­ing to visit a se­nior home, it is more im­por­tant to find out if their par­ents had shown any flu-like symp­toms in re­cent weeks, in­stead of just screen­ing the chil­dren, who may be asymp­to­matic.</p>
