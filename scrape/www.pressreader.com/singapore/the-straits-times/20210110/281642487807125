    <p>TOKYO • Osaka and its sur­round­ing pre­fec­tures asked the Ja­panese govern­ment to ex­pand a state of emer­gency to the western cities in an ef­fort to con­tain the lat­est coron­avirus out­break, while Tokyo’s new daily in­fec­tions stayed above 2,000 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ya­su­toshi Nishimura, the econ­omy min­is­ter, told the me­dia the sit­u­a­tion in the western cities of Osaka, Ky­oto and Hyogo was se­vere and the dec­la­ra­tion of a wider state of emer­gency was be­ing con­sid­ered af­ter a re­quest from gover­nors of the cities.</p>
    <p>Japan de­clared a limited state of emer­gency in Tokyo and three pre­fec­tures near the cap­i­tal last Thurs­day to stem a surge i n Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has re­sisted calls from some ex­perts for wider curbs be­yond those im­posed in Tokyo be­cause of the eco­nomic pain they would cause.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts and of­fi­cials have warned that the limited, onemonth state of emer­gency tar­get­ing Tokyo and neigh­bour­ing pre­fec­tures could lead to a con­trac­tion in eco­nomic growth for the cur­rent quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Another con­trac­tion in AprilJune, though con­sid­ered un­likely for now, could be­come a re­al­ity if broader and longer curbs be­come nec­es­sary to slow the spread of Covid-19, some an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>That would push Japan into another re­ces­sion, de­fined as two con­sec­u­tive quar­ters of eco­nomic con­trac­tion, fol­low­ing one in the first half of last year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many pol­i­cy­mak­ers say the hit to growth this time will not be as se­vere as last year’s state of emer­gency, which hurt re­tail­ers na­tion­wide and forced many man­u­fac­tur­ers to sus­pend pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Tokyo re­ported 2,268 new daily coron­avirus cases yes­ter­day, the third straight day above 2,000, ac­cord­ing to the public broad­caster NHK.</p>
