    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Di­rec­tor Christo­pher Nolan’s new thriller, Tenet, re­ceived warm re­views last Fri­day as Amer­i­can cinema chains re­opened with in­dus­try-wide safety mea­sures aimed at re­as­sur­ing au­di­ences dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Tenet is the first big-bud­get movie from a ma­jor Hol­ly­wood stu­dio to hit the­atres since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut­tered cin­e­mas around the world in March.</p>
    <p>Ticket sales for the film from AT&T’s Warner Bros will be closely watched as a gauge of how many peo­ple will leave their homes to go to the movies.</p>
    <p>The film opens in 70 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Singapore, start­ing on</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day and i n the United States on Thurs­day next week.</p>
    <p>Tenet got an 87 per cent ap­proval rate on re­view ag­gre­ga­tor web­site Rot­ten Toma­toes, though crit­ics said its time-bend­ing plot was so con­torted, it was hard to fol­low at times.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor John David Wash­ing­ton, son of su­per­star Den­zel Wash­ing­ton, plays an op­er­a­tive of the Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency re­cruited to help the shad­owy Tenet or­gan­i­sa­tion, which is try­ing to stop an apoc­a­lyp­tic event.</p>
    <p>The Times of Lon­don called the 21/ 2- hour film a “glo­be­trot­ting, jaw-drop­ping and de­light­fully con­vo­luted big-screen block­buster” and added: “Cinema, fi­nally, has re­turned.”</p>
    <p>The New York Times said the movie was en­joy­able and “re­as­sur­ingly mas­sive in every way as a piece of movie-mak­ing shot across mul­ti­ple global lo­ca­tions”.</p>
    <p>IndieWire was less im­pressed, call­ing the movie a “hu­mour­less dis­ap­point­ment”.</p>
    <p>The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter said Tenet had a lot rid­ing on it: “There will be view­ers scru­ti­n­is­ing every tweet, re­view and opin­ion ag­gre­ga­tor as they weigh whether to leave their quar­an­tine bub­bles to see it.”</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas have been grad­u­ally open­ing around the world.</p>
    <p>In the US, ma­jor chains – in­clud­ing AMC The­atres and Cineworld’s Re­gal Cin­e­mas – opened their doors last week­end with lim­ited at­ten­dance, mask re­quire­ments and other mea­sures to re­duce the chances of catch­ing the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Theatre Own­ers an­nounced last Fri­day that op­er­a­tors of more than 30,000 screens had agreed on a stan­dard set of pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>“Movie­go­ers need to know that there is a con­sis­tent, science and ex­pe­ri­ence-based set of health and safety pro­to­cols in place no mat­ter what theatre they visit,” said Mr John Fithian, pres­i­dent of the in­dus­try group.</p>
