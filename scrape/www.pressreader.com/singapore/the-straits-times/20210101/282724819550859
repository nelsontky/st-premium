    <p>WHO: Multi-hy­phen­ate di­rec­tor-ed­i­tor-writer Ni­cole Mi­dori Wood­ford, 34, is sched­uled to be­gin shoot­ing her de­but fea­ture film this spring af­ter a long ges­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, whose an­ces­try in­cludes a Ja­panese grand­mother and a Bri­tish-Por­tuguese Eurasian father, was named one of the Young Artist Award win­ners last year.</p>
    <p>The award, given out by the Na­tional Arts Council to artists aged 35 and younger, aims to en­cour­age young artists in the pur­suit of their prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Wood­ford, who also teaches film stud­ies at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s School of Art, De­sign and Me­dia, will be direct­ing an episode of the se­cond sea­son of Folk­lore, HBO’s su­per­nat­u­ral an­thol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“Week­ends have be­come es­sen­tial for me to tie up loose ends from the work week while</p>
    <p>I jug­gle house­hold chores with my hus­band. We some­times make pan­cakes from scratch on Satur­day morn­ings or grab roti prata from the cof­fee shop nearby be­fore we start clean­ing our flat and run­ning er­rands.</p>
    <p>If I’m pre­par­ing for an upcoming shoot, I might have to go on lo­ca­tion rec­ces or con­duct Zoom meet­ings. Cur­rently, I’m pre­par­ing for my episode for the se­cond sea­son of HBO Asia’s Folk­lore.</p>
    <p>But if not, I might use it to catch up on some read­ing to pre­pare for my lec­ture notes and col­late ref­er­ences to show my stu­dents.</p>
    <p>We love go­ing to Tiong Bahru Hawker Cen­tre to get lunch and then go gro­cery shop­ping af­ter that. As we live in the Tiong Bahru neigh­bour­hood, it’s al­ways nice to take a walk around and savour some of the treats from the cafes.</p>
    <p>For me, the true week­end starts on Sun­day, when I try to un­wind by read­ing. Or we might try to catch a film – the last film we caught was Never Rarely Some­times Al­ways (2020) at</p>
    <p>The Pro­jec­tor.</p>
    <p>I also try to get some down­time with our cat, which loves to cud­dle with me when I’m read­ing my graphic nov­els. We have a lot of plants around our apart­ment, so week­ends are nice for me to tend to them too.</p>
    <p>Once in a while, we might en­ter­tain some friends at our place. I like to make some cock­tails while we play board games. I have quite a few friends, mostly from the film-mak­ing in­dus­try, who love board games.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, they in­tro­duced me to games such as Viti­cul­ture, Wingspan and Azul. It’s al­ways lovely to catch up while play­ing these games on a rainy Sun­day af­ter­noon.</p>
