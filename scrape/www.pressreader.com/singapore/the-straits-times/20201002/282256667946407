    <p>• Rolls-Royce Hold­ings ended talks to raise £500 mil­lion (S$881 mil­lion) from sovereign funds in Sin­ga­pore and Kuwait and will in­stead seek to raise £2 bil­lion from ex­ist­ing share­hold­ers, Sky re­ported.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent own­ers op­posed the di­lu­tion that would oc­cur if out­side in­vestors are brought into the £2.5 bil­lion fund-rais­ing ef­fort, it re­ported, cit­ing a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Sky News had ear­lier re­ported that Sin­ga­pore’s GIC and Kuwait In­vest­ment Of­fice were con­sid­er­ing an in­vest­ment in the en­gine maker.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish maker of air­craft en­gines was likely to un­veil a fi­nanc­ing pack­age as early as yes­ter­day that in­cluded ad­di­tional bor­row­ing power, Sky said.</p>
    <p>Rolls-Royce has lost more than 80 per cent of its value this year, touch­ing a fresh 17-year low on Wed­nes­day amid a broad in­dus­try down­turn trig­gered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has been hit par­tic­u­larly hard by the drop in long-dis­tance travel, which has sharply cur­tailed de­mand for the wide-body planes pow­ered by its en­gines.</p>
    <p>Many air­craft in the ex­ist­ing fleets have been tem­po­rar­ily or per­ma­nently grounded, depriv­ing Rolls-Royce of the vi­tal main­te­nance rev­enue it col­lects when they fly.</p>
    <p>Rolls-Royce has also seen its debt down­graded to junk this year, mean­ing bor­row­ing would come at a higher cost than be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
