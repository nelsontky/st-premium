    <p>MUM­BAI • In­dia’s top anti-crime agency is tak­ing over the in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the death of movie star Sushant Singh Rajput, whose sui­cide has shaken Bol­ly­wood and sparked bit­ter re­crim­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Rajput, 34, was found dead in June in his Mum­bai apart­ment – with po­lice say­ing he took his own life – set­ting off a de­bate over men­tal health in the multi-bil­lion-dol­lar in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>His for­mer girl­friend, ac­tress Rhea Chakrabort­y, pe­ti­tioned the Supreme Court on Wed­nes­day af­ter Rajput’s fam­ily dis­puted re­ports that he suf­fered from de­pres­sion and ac­cused her of steal­ing his money and ha­rass­ing him.</p>
    <p>Chakrabort­y, 28, strongly de­nied the al­le­ga­tions and asked the coun­try’s high­est court to trans­fer the case from lo­cal po­lice in Rajput’s home state of Bi­har.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment so­lic­i­tor gen­eral Tushar Mehta told the hear­ing that the Cen­tral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, In­dia’s top fed­eral crime agency, would take charge of the case, which has grabbed me­dia head­lines for weeks.</p>
    <p>Born in Bi­har, Rajput quit en­gi­neer­ing stud­ies to pur­sue a ca­reer in act­ing and dance. He got his big break in 2013 with Kai Po Che, a film about cricket, love and pol­i­tics that won ac­claim at the Ber­lin film fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>He was also lauded for his por­trayal of In­dian cricket hero Ma­hen­dra Singh Dhoni in the 2016 hit M.S. Dhoni: The Un­told Story.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Agence France-Presse in 2016, Rajput spoke of the emo­tional roller­coaster he ex­pe­ri­enced while film­ing the movie, which por­trayed the heart­break suf­fered by Dhoni when the crick­eter’s girl­friend died.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter we did the prepa­ra­tion, in my head I was him and ev­ery­thing that was hap­pen­ing was ac­tu­ally af­fect­ing me,” he said.</p>
    <p>Rajput’s death – barely a week af­ter his man­ager took her own life – rekin­dled dis­cus­sions about men­tal health in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Stars such as Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma, who have spo­ken about their own bat­tles with de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety, posted mes­sages on the im­por­tance of seek­ing help.</p>
    <p>It also sparked an an­gry out­cry from fans and fel­low ac­tors about the dif­fi­cul­ties faced by as­pi­rants strug­gling to grab a foothold in Bol­ly­wood, with some at­tack­ing the in­dus­try for its in­sid­ers-only cul­ture.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try has a long his­tory of of­fer­ing lead­ing roles to the chil­dren of celebri­ties, of­ten with no prior act­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Rajput’s last film was a Hindi re­make of the Hol­ly­wood ro­mance The Fault In Our Stars (2014), ti­tled Dil Bechara (Poor Heart), which was re­leased last month.</p>
