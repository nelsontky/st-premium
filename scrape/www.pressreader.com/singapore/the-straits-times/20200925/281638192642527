    <p>The num­ber of heat in­jury cases in the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) has de­clined by 40 per cent in the past two years, and there have been no cases of heat­stroke, said the Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Since the death of Cor­po­ral First Class (CFC) Dave Lee from heat­stroke in 2018, the SAF has also in­tro­duced en­hance­ments to ex­ist­ing heat in­jury man­age­ment and preven­tion mea­sures, added Min­def.</p>
    <p>These in­clude im­ple­ment­ing a sim­pli­fied evac­u­a­tion pro­to­col; im­prov­ing heat in­jury aware­ness for com­man­ders and medics; en­hanc­ing ex­ist­ing cool­ing and heat in­jury preven­tion mea­sures; and strength­en­ing an open re­port­ing cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“Min­def and the SAF will con­tinue to re­view and iden­tify ways to strengthen our safety man­age­ment and train­ing sys­tem, with the goal of achiev­ing zero train­ing fa­tal­i­ties,” it added.</p>
    <p>CFC Lee, 19, a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man who was a guards­man from the 1st Bat­tal­ion Sin­ga­pore Guards, suf­fered heat­stroke af­ter com­plet­ing an 8km fast march in Be­dok Camp on April 18, 2018. He died on April 30 that year.</p>
    <p>In the same state­ment yes­ter­day, Min­def said that six ser­vice­men who were charged in mil­i­tary court in re­la­tion to CFC Lee’s death were fined for their roles in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>A sev­enth ser­vice­man was granted a dis­charge not amount­ing to an ac­quit­tal in Jan­uary this year af­ter be­ing di­ag­nosed with Stage 4 can­cer. He died on Feb 13.</p>
    <p>The latest fig­ures on heat in­jury come af­ter the de­cline of such cases since 2012.</p>
    <p>There were 25 heat­stroke and 137 heat ex­haus­tion cases in the army from April 2012 to March 2018, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by an ex­ter­nal panel in 2018. None was fatal.</p>
    <p>The five-mem­ber panel was con­vened in May 2018 af­ter CFC Lee’s death to re­view the SAF’s ex­ist­ing strat­egy for heat in­jury preven­tion and man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>From Au­gust 2018, the SAF has ex­panded the use of an arm im­mer­sion cool­ing sys­tem and pur­pose­built cool­ing pads to tackle heat in­jury.</p>
    <p>Arm im­mer­sion is a pre­ven­tive mea­sure where sol­diers dip their arms into iced wa­ter for be­tween 15 and 30 sec­onds to help cool their core body tem­per­a­ture, done dur­ing rest pe­ri­ods in train­ing, and af­ter train­ing. Pur­pose-built cool­ing pads, which can be stuck on the body, help to cool a sus­pected heat in­jury ca­su­alty.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures taken i n the wake of CFC Lee’s death in­clude rolling out a new train­ing safety reg­u­la­tion for all com­man­ders and medics to evac­u­ate ev­ery trainee who can­not re­spond to sim­ple ques­tions on time, place and iden­tity.</p>
    <p>More op­por­tu­ni­ties for make-up train­ing were also pro­vided so that sol­diers would not push them­selves be­yond safety lim­its.</p>
