    <p>The on­go­ing and planned vac­cine roll-out around the world not only marks a health break­through, but will also help boost eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and speed up a re­turn to greater nor­malcy in many as­pects of day-to-day life. How­ever, ex­pec­ta­tions need to be tem­pered be­cause the pos­i­tive ef­fects are likely to ma­te­ri­alise only grad­u­ally. More­over, there will also be af­ter-ef­fects from the year-long pan­demic that has dev­as­tated sev­eral economies, and which could un­cover new down­side risks. The global vac­cine roll-out will hap­pen at vary­ing speeds in dif­fer­ent coun­tries, many of which will face for­mi­da­ble lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenges in se­cur­ing, dis­tribut­ing and de­ploy­ing vac­cines. The take-up rate for vac­ci­na­tions – which are vol­un­tary – will also be un­cer­tain, in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore. Thus, it will be sev­eral months be­fore large enough sec­tions of the pop­u­la­tion are vac­ci­nated to en­able a re­turn to more nor­mal life.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, many economies – which are still reel­ing from ris­ing num­bers of in­fec­tions, es­pe­cially among de­vel­oped coun­tries – re­main weak. The In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF) projects that the global econ­omy will con­tract by 4.4 per cent this year, and Asian economies by 1.7 per cent. And although a brisk re­cov­ery is pro­vi­sion­ally fore­cast for next year, sev­eral in­sti­tu­tions have warned of lin­ger­ing prob­lems from the pan­demic. The IMF noted that de­spite the re­cov­ery in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, un­em­ploy­ment rates are ex­pected to re­main el­e­vated across de­vel­oped and de­vel­op­ing economies. The World Bank warned that the pan­demic will push some 150 mil­lion more peo­ple into poverty by next year, and the In­ter­na­tional Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion flagged the risk of a cor­po­rate debt and bank­ing cri­sis in Asia af­ter the lift­ing of loan mora­to­ri­ums and bank for­bear­ance.</p>
    <p>Also im­por­tant is the fact that progress in pan­demic con­trol and vac­ci­na­tion in one or a few coun­tries will not be suf­fi­cient in restor­ing nor­malcy, es­pe­cially in sec­tors that de­pend on the cross-bor­der move­ment of peo­ple. For ex­am­ple, Sin­ga­pore’s tran­si­tion to phase three of its re­open­ing and its moves to ex­pand travel bub­bles for busi­ness vis­i­tors will be wel­come news, es­pe­cially for the be­lea­guered avi­a­tion, tourism and hospi­tal­ity sec­tors. But the ef­fec­tive­ness of the mea­sures de­pends on the suc­cess of other coun­tries con­trol­ling their own out­breaks and re­open­ing their economies. Re­open­ings also en­tail risks.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries which re­laxed so­cial re­stric­tions ear­lier this year have faced sec­ond and third waves of Covid-19. Travel bub­bles can also be sub­ject to risk, as il­lus­trated by the post­pone­ment of the Hong Kong-Sin­ga­pore travel bub­ble last month be­cause of a sud­den spike in cases in Hong Kong. Given all these un­cer­tain­ties, the ar­rival of vac­cines, while a wel­come de­vel­op­ment, is not likely to be the magic bul­let that re­stores nor­malcy, at least well into next year.</p>
