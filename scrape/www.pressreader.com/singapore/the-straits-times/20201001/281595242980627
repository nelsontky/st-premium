    <p>Ja­pan’s De­fence Min­istry yes­ter­day re­quested a record 5.49 tril­lion yen (S$71 bil­lion) bud­get for the fis­cal year start­ing April, to build and buy more air­craft and weaponry amid ris­ing mil­i­tary ten­sions in the re­gion. The re­quest is up 3.3 per cent from the ini­tial bud­get for the cur­rent fis­cal year, with de­fence spend­ing ex­pected to rise for the ninth con­sec­u­tive year.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s De­fence Min­istry sought a bud­get in­crease from Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day, to build and buy more air­craft and weaponry amid ris­ing mil­i­tary ten­sions in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>If ap­proved by the Cabi­net, the 5.49 tril­lion yen (S$71 bil­lion) sum for the fis­cal year start­ing April next year will mark a ninth straight an­nual rise. It will be a 3.3 per cent in­crease from the ini­tial de­fence bud­get for this fis­cal year.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan will also host a meet­ing next Tues­day of top diplo­mats from the other Quad na­tions – the</p>
    <p>United States, Aus­tralia and In­dia – to dis­cuss the Free and Open In­doPa­cific pol­icy that was mooted to coun­ter­bal­ance China.</p>
    <p>It will be the first face-to-face high-level mul­ti­lat­eral con­fer­ence in Tokyo since the Covid-19 out­break, and comes amid ris­ing Chi­nese as­sertive­ness in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Hosted by For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi, the con­fer­ence will bring to­gether US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, Aus­tralian For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne and In­dian Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­is­ter Subrah­manyam Jais­hankar.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi, not­ing the “in­creas­ing value propo­si­tion” that the Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific pol­icy brings to the re­gion, told a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day: “It is timely that for­eign min­is­ters from the four coun­tries that share the same am­bi­tions over re­gional mat­ters ex­change views over var­i­ous chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga is also plan­ning his first over­seas vis­its – to Viet­nam and In­done­sia, this month – since he took of­fice, Ja­panese me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>This echoes the ac­tions of his pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe, who also vis­ited the two coun­tries first af­ter tak­ing of­fice amid an Asean-cen­tric fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s gov­ern­ment is set to put to­gether an up­dated de­fence plan by the end of this year, and will very likely ap­prove a con­tro­ver­sial plan for pre-emp­tive strikes on en­emy bases if an at­tack is deemed to be im­mi­nent.</p>
    <p>Tokyo is also study­ing al­ter­na­tives to the Aegis Ashore mis­sile de­fence sys­tem, which was scrapped in June over bal­loon­ing costs and safety and tech­ni­cal con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Thus, the De­fence Min­istry bud­get re­quest yes­ter­day does not in­clude th­ese po­ten­tial costs, and may yet in­crease fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Still, the 5.49 tril­lion yen plan in­cludes sub­stan­tial in­creases for de­fence against space, cy­ber and elec­tro­mag­netic war­fare.</p>
    <p>It sought 123.7 bil­lion yen – an in­crease of 18 per cent over this year – for outer space, in­clud­ing for fea­si­bil­ity stud­ies on a con­stel­la­tion of small satel­lites for con­stant sur­veil­lance. An­other 23 bil­lion yen will be spent on sur­veil­lance against elec­tro­mag­netic at­tacks.</p>
    <p>It also in­tends to de­vote 35.7 bil­lion yen to cy­ber se­cu­rity – a 50 per cent rise from this year – with plans to set up a new cy­ber-se­cu­rity unit within Ja­pan’s Self-De­fence Forces.</p>
    <p>But the bulk of the sum will be for con­ven­tional weaponry, in­clud­ing 58.7 bil­lion yen to re­search and de­velop a next-gen­er­a­tion stealth fighter jet.</p>
    <p>An­other 66.6 bil­lion yen will be spent on four F-35A fighter air­craft and two ver­ti­cal take-off F-35B jets.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan plans to spend 69.1 bil­lion yen to build a sub­ma­rine, as well as 15.3 bil­lion yen to de­velop an an­ti­air­craft jam­mer and 3.3 bil­lion yen to test an anti-drone laser weapon.</p>
    <p>But Kobe Univer­sity se­cu­rity ex­pert Tosh Mi­no­hara thinks that the re­quested bud­get in­crease is “not nearly enough”.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause Ja­pan, which spent just 0.9 per cent of its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct on de­fence last year, still falls short of ex­pec­ta­tions that 2 per cent be spent on de­fence.</p>
    <p>He said: “This is not China against Ja­pan, but against the world with shared val­ues, which is only as strong as the sum of its parts.”</p>
    <p>Tokyo is also study­ing al­ter­na­tives to the Aegis Ashore mis­sile de­fence sys­tem, which was scrapped in June over bal­loon­ing costs and safety and tech­ni­cal con­cerns. Thus, the De­fence Min­istry bud­get re­quest yes­ter­day does not in­clude th­ese po­ten­tial costs, and may yet in­crease fur­ther.</p>
