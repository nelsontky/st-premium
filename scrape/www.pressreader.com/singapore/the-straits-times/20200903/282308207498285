    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based Zouk Group is forg­ing ahead with global ex­pan­sion plans, even as it faces a chal­leng­ing busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment and a fu­ture with­out the back­ing of the Gent­ing group.</p>
    <p>Zouk’s op­er­a­tions and busi­ness di­rec­tion will re­main un­changed un­der a new man­age­ment and there will be no lay­offs, the group’s chief ex­ec­u­tive An­drew Li told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The $14 mil­lion man­age­ment buy­out, an­nounced on Tues­day, is a per­sonal in­vest­ment by Mr Lim Keong Hui, a Gent­ing scion, to sup­port the growth of the life­style group he helped to cre­ate and to ease Gent­ing Hong Kong’s cash crunch, Mr Li said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, who is the son of Gent­ing group chair­man Lim Kok Thay, stepped down from the board of ail­ing cruise op­er­a­tor Gent­ing Hong Kong last week. He is the sole owner of Malaysian firm Tulipa, the buyer in the cash deal.</p>
    <p>Mr Li said: “Given the chal­lenges Gent­ing Hong Kong is fac­ing dur­ing the pan­demic, we thought it would make more sense to take Zouk out since it’s not a core as­set, and con­tinue to build the brand.”</p>
    <p>Plans are in the works to ex­pand the Zouk brand and grow its head­count, which cur­rently stands at about 300.</p>
    <p>De­tails on new projects will be an­nounced in the com­ing months, Mr Li said.</p>
    <p>He will con­tinue to steer the ship as CEO of the Zouk Group, but re­lin­quish his po­si­tion as vice-pres­i­dent of Gent­ing Hong Kong, which he has held since 2015.</p>
    <p>He helped to spear­head the ac­qui­si­tion of home-grown night­club Zouk that year, and together with Mr Lim grew it into a life­style group with 17 out­lets glob­ally, in­clud­ing the Em­pire club in Re­sorts World Gent­ing and the Five Guys burger joint in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It was al­ways our vi­sion to build this global life­style plat­form, and over the last four years we’ve made huge strides,” Mr Li said.</p>
    <p>The group must now stand on its own feet, and Mr Li said he is con­fi­dent that it will be self-sus­tain­ing by next year, de­spite the is­sues from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As night­club ac­tiv­i­ties re­main banned in Sin­ga­pore, Zouk has pur­sued new rev­enue streams, in­clud­ing a live-stream­ing tie-up with e-com­merce plat­form Lazada and the con­ver­sion of its Cap­i­tal lounge into a restau­rant.</p>
    <p>Tran­si­tion­ing the group to a pri­vate company will al­low it to be more ag­ile in re­spond­ing to chal­lenges, Mr Li said.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, Zouk will con­tinue its part­ner­ships with Gent­ing on projects re­lated to the lat­ter’s re­sorts and cruise ships.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said in a state­ment to ST that he is ex­cited to be part of Zouk’s evo­lu­tion into a global hos­pi­tal­ity brand, adding that it has built up a dy­namic man­age­ment team over the past five years.</p>
    <p>“By piv­ot­ing and ex­per­i­ment­ing dur­ing these dif­fi­cult times, Zouk is able to seek new ways to con­tin­u­ously serve our cus­tomers,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School noted that Gent­ing Hong Kong has been badly af­fected by the pan­demic and needs liq­uid­ity.</p>
    <p>It owed US$3.4 bil­lion (S$4.6 bil­lion) as at July 31, and sus­pended pay­ments to cred­i­tors last month to pre­serve ser­vices crit­i­cal to the company’s op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“While the Zouk sale will not be able to solve the large debt prob­lem, the pro­ceeds will buy time for Gent­ing Hong Kong to hold on in terms of work­ing cap­i­tal,” said Prof Loh.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tion may also ben­e­fit the Zouk Group in the long run, he added.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing out of the Gent­ing um­brella, Zouk will be ring-fenced from the re­struc­tur­ing, in­clud­ing even pos­si­ble cred­i­tor ac­tions.”</p>
