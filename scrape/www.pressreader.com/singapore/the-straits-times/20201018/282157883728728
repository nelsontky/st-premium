    <p>Jose Mour­inho won his first Premier League ti­tle in char­ac­ter­is­tic fash­ion. Bolton were beaten 2-0. It was one of eight 2-0 wins in his first year at Chelsea. There were 11 more in his sopho­more sea­son.</p>
    <p>There was some­thing cold and clin­i­cal about the score­line: the clean sheet, of course, the all-im­por­tant opener and then a sec­ond goal as in­sur­ance for the un­likely prospect Chelsea con­ceded. But then the pro­fes­sion­al­ism to shut a game down, rather than wan­tonly run­ning riot in a thrash­ing.</p>
    <p>But 11 months into his reign at Tot­ten­ham, Mour­inho has only two 2-0 wins. One came against West Ham, to­day’s op­po­nents, but his de­but 3-2 vic­tory against the Ham­mers felt more re­veal­ing.</p>
    <p>It would have sounded strange for much of his ca­reer, but Mour­inho has more 3-2s than 2-0s with his cur­rent club. Eight games into the cur­rent cam­paign and af­ter fac­ing Loko­mo­tiv Plov­div, Shk­endija and Mac­cabi Haifa, Spurs are yet to keep a clean sheet.</p>
    <p>But they have scored 13 goals in their last two matches. Their Premier League away re­sults this sea­son are 5-2 and 6-1, score­lines that once would have been anath­ema to Mour­inho.</p>
    <p>So has the Premier League’s great con­trol freak turned an­ar­chist? Has he gone from prag­ma­tist to un­likely en­ter­tainer? Pos­si­bly, though for wildly dif­fer­ent rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The first is that Mour­inho is no longer the prince of the dark arts, the great de­fen­sive strate­gist. Since the sum­mer of 2015, his teams have con­ceded 147 goals in 139 league games; Pep Guardi­ola has a rep­u­ta­tion as a more at­tack­ing man­ager but has a bet­ter de­fen­sive record in Eng­land in that time.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho has not had the same cal­i­bre of de­fend­ers as he did dur­ing his glory days with Chelsea, and his teams have not been as solid.</p>
    <p>The other part of the prob­lem was that he felt left be­hind as more pro­lific teams spear­headed a more mod­ern phi­los­o­phy; his Cris­tiano Ron­aldo-pow­ered Real Madrid topped 100 goals in each of his sea­sons in La Liga but a Premier League best of 73 feels in­suf­fi­cient when Manch­ester City of­ten post a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Per­haps Mour­inho is be­lat­edly ad­just­ing. Maybe he is un­leash­ing bet­ter at­tack­ers than at any stage in Eng­land since he had a for­ward line of Di­dier Drogba, Damien Duff and Ar­jen Robben. Now Son He­ung-min has six goals and an as­sist in four league games and Harry Kane three goals and six as­sists.</p>
    <p>Gareth Bale will com­plete a fear­some front three if he is fit to make his sec­ond de­but to­day. It al­lies counter-at­tack­ing pace and power, which Mour­inho likes, with out­stand­ing fin­ish­ers, but also Kane’s grow­ing cre­ativ­ity. When he drops deep to act as the false nine, it is al­most a tac­tic bor­rowed from Jur­gen Klopp; so, too, the most at­tack­ing full-backs Mour­inho has ever had.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the big change, though, is not in tac­tics, but mind­set and men­tal­ity. If de­fen­sive is­sues mean a clean sheet is not guar­an­teed, Spurs have more need to at­tack and at­tack. It was how they beat United 6-1. Maybe it showed Mour­inho has rein­vented him­self.</p>
    <p>So has the Premier League’s great con­trol freak turned an­ar­chist? Has he gone from prag­ma­tist to un­likely en­ter­tainer? Pos­si­bly, though for wildly dif­fer­ent rea­sons.</p>
