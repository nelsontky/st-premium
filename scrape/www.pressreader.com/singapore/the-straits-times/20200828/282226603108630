    <p>More in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions have dis­tanced them­selves from the Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group, which has come un­der fire for ques­tion­able mar­ket­ing ma­te­rial in­clud­ing doc­tored images of for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>The com­pany – co-founded by Sin­ga­porean cousins Nel­son Loh and Ter­ence Loh and Chi­nese busi­ness­woman Evan­ge­line Shen – was thrust into the spot­light when it placed a bid for English Premier League foot­ball club New­cas­tle United on Aug 15.</p>
    <p>The Busi­ness Times re­ported yes­ter­day that the bad pub­lic­ity has led some anx­ious lo­cal and re­gional in­vestors to step up ef­forts to pull out mil­lions of dol­lars in­vested in en­ti­ties un­der the Novena Global Health­care Group founded by the cousins.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­di­vid­u­als from Sin­ga­pore, Thai­land, In­done­sia and China are among some 20 to 30 in­vestors who had in­vested in con­vert­ible bonds and eq­uity in en­ti­ties un­der Novena Global, it said.</p>
    <p>Sources said the to­tal sums in­volved could reach up to US$20 mil­lion (S$27.3 mil­lion), the re­port added. The Lohs did not re­spond to queries.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor and host Al­lan Wu, who was listed as a “health ad­vo­cate” for Novena Global Life­care, one of the BN Group’s “31 en­ti­ties”, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that he has ended his part­ner­ship. “I am not an am­bas­sador or in­volved with Novena Global Life­care any­more,” he said, when asked about his links.</p>
    <p>He added that “Novena Global Life­care was plan­ning on go­ing a dif­fer­ent di­rec­tion with BN Group”. He was also about to start a film­ing project in China from last month “so it seemed like the right time”.</p>
    <p>Novena Global Life­care was founded by the cousins in 2010. The med­i­cal health­care and aes­thet­ics group states on its web­site that it is in “250 lo­ca­tions in over 20 cities”.</p>
    <p>Since April, Mr Wu has put up sev­eral pro­mo­tional so­cial me­dia posts and videos on Novena Global Life­care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based race car driver and em­cee Claire Je­drek, who had been an­nounced as the BN Group’s global com­mu­ni­ca­tions and me­dia of­fi­cer in late June, has not been with the com­pany since the mid­dle of last month.</p>
    <p>She is mar­ried to Sin­ga­pore race car driver Yuey Tan, whom the Lohs had re­port­edly backed from 2012 to 2014 through their Dorr Group.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions have been raised about the BN Group since Reuters re­ported last week­end that pub­lic­ity pho­tos with Mr Obama had been doc­tored to make it look like he had met the Lohs and Ms Shen in Paris.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama had in fact at­tended a char­ity event in Sin­ga­pore last De­cem­ber spon­sored by Novena Global Life­care, where the trio were among those present.</p>
    <p>Other dis­crep­an­cies have since sur­faced in its press ma­te­rial, some of which has been re­tracted.</p>
    <p>The group’s chief mar­ket­ing and in­vestor re­la­tions of­fi­cer Nerei­des de Bour­bon had told Reuters there “wasn’t any ma­li­cious aim be­hind” the al­tered pho­tos.</p>
    <p>But on Tues­day, BN Group claimed that “cer­tain er­rant in­di­vid­u­als, pos­si­bly with ma­li­cious in­tent”, ap­peared to be be­hind the ma­te­rial. It was get­ting an in­de­pen­dent coun­sel to look into this.</p>
    <p>Since then, for­mer United States am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar has re­signed from his in­de­pen­dent direc­tor po­si­tion in Catal­istlisted Ax­ing­ton, where the Lohs are con­trol­ling share­hold­ers and Ms Shen is its non-in­de­pen­dent nonex­ec­u­tive chair­man.</p>
    <p>The cousins had on Tues­day also claimed that “er­rant in­di­vid­u­als” pre­ma­turely up­loaded the Loh Broth­ers Foun­da­tion web­site, which has since been taken down.</p>
    <p>The web­site had listed among its board mem­bers Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Boon Gin, Se­nior Coun­sel Sreeni­vasan Narayanan, and “Megvii Face++ chair­man Yi Bao”.</p>
    <p>While Mr Sreeni­vasan is a direc­tor at the foun­da­tion, Mr Tan is not.</p>
    <p>Megvii Tech­nol­ogy, a Chi­nese tech com­pany, reached out to The Straits Times to say that its chair­man is Mr Yin Qi, and he is not a board mem­ber of the foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>A spokesman added it does not have an em­ployee called Yi Bao and added that its name is not Megvii Face++. Face++ is one of the com­pany’s products.</p>
    <p>While it was men­tioned on the web­site that the Lohs are pa­trons of the Hong Kah (Gek Poh) Grass­root Com­mu­nity, the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion has since clar­i­fied that the two are “no longer pa­trons of Gek Poh Ville CCMC”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ben­e­fi­cia­ries stated on the site – Sin­ga­pore Muay Thai Fed­er­a­tion, race car driver Tan, Xin Hua Novu Blaze bas­ket­ball club and St Michael’s Soc­cer As­so­ci­a­tion (SMSA) – said they re­ceived spon­sor­ships via Novu Aes­thet­ics, an­other BN Group en­tity.</p>
    <p>SMSA pres­i­dent Kieren Pereira said the spon­sor­ship in­cluded match kits and fi­nan­cial aid for over­seas com­pe­ti­tions for chil­dren un­able to af­ford flight fares and ac­com­mo­da­tion costs.</p>
    <p>“From our un­der­stand­ing, Ter­ence Loh de­cided to spon­sor SMSA as a way of giv­ing back to the chil­dren of his old school and con­tribut­ing to the lo­cal sports scene,” he said.</p>
