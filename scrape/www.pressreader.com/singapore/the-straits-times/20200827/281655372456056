    <p>About 6,400 jobs, trainee­ships, at­tach­ments and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties are on of­fer from nearly 1,000 com­pa­nies in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor for lo­cal job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Of these, about four in five – or 5,100 roles – are for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) in the weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Jobs made up slightly more than half of the roles, with 2,400 for PMETs and 800 for non-PMETs.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, trainee­ships and at­tach­ments made up 2,100 roles, with 1,800 for PMETs and 300 for non-PMETs. Of the train­ing roles on of­fer, 900 are for PMETs and 200 are for non-PMETs.</p>
    <p>The top job roles in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor are en­gi­neer­ing pro­fes­sion­als, elec­tron­ics en­gi­neers, man­u­fac­tur­ing en­gi­neer­ing tech­ni­cians, pro­duc­tion clerks, and ad­min­is­tra­tive pro­fes­sion­als or as­so­ci­ates.</p>
    <p>The me­dian salary for these roles range from $1,500 for a pro­duc­tion clerk to $4,700 for an elec­tron­ics en­gi­neer, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia yes­ter­day dur­ing a visit to multi­na­tional med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy com­pany Bec­ton Dick­in­son, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said the roles will put job seek­ers in a “stronger po­si­tion when the hir­ing de­mand re­sumes”.</p>
    <p>So far, more than 730 job seek­ers have en­tered the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor with sup­port from SGUnited Jobs and Skills pro­grammes. About 62 per cent were mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als who par­tic­i­pated in Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies may have also filled new po­si­tions di­rectly without us­ing the gov­ern­ment job por­tal MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg or no­ti­fy­ing MOM or WSG, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Since June, about 60 fresh and re­cent grad­u­ates have en­tered the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor via the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme with more than 25 or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Among the roles are about 400 in the bio­med­i­cal sci­ence sec­tor of­fered un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age, with about three in four still un­filled.</p>
    <p>The avail­able po­si­tions in­clude biotech­nol­o­gists, pro­duc­tion man­agers in cell and gene ther­apy, au­to­ma­tion en­gi­neers, chemists, val­i­da­tion spe­cial­ists, qual­ity as­sur­ance man­agers and mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gists.</p>
    <p>“The bio­med­i­cal sci­ence sub-sec­tor re­mains a bright spot,” said MOM, not­ing that out­put in the clus­ter grew nearly 27 per cent in the first half of this year, led by higher pro­duc­tion of ac­tive phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­gre­di­ents and bi­o­log­i­cal prod­ucts in the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals seg­ment.</p>
    <p>MOM also said more job seek­ers sought ba­sic ca­reer ad­vi­sory or job search as­sis­tance through WSG and the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i).</p>
    <p>About 36,400 did so be­tween Jan­uary and July this year, a 30 per cent in­crease from the same pe­riod last year. Of this num­ber, 22,700 re­ceived in­di­vid­ual ca­reer coach­ing – 20 per cent more than the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>MOM said the in­crease was de­spite re­stric­tions dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, as WSG and e2i con­tin­ued with ac­tiv­i­ties such as net­work­ing ses­sions with em­ploy­ers vir­tu­ally, and job coach­ing through phone or video.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, in the first half of this year, about 19,000 job seek­ers were placed in ca­reer con­ver­sion and reskilling pro­grammes and ac­tiv­i­ties – about 15 per cent more than in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
