    <p>The United States and China must find some ba­sis for co­op­er­a­tion, or risk slid­ing into a catas­tro­phe “com­pa­ra­ble to World War I”, for­mer US sec­re­tary of state Henry Kissinger said at a global fo­rum, de­liv­er­ing a stark warn­ing on the state of ties be­tween the two su­per­pow­ers.</p>
    <p>“I’m not say­ing that we and China will live with a con­scious­ness of har­mony. I am say­ing that there will al­ways be stresses and ten­sions. The ques­tion is, ‘Is there a di­rec­tion in which we can co­op­er­ate?’ ” said Dr Kissinger.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Bloomberg New Econ­omy Fo­rum on Mon­day, which is be­ing held vir­tu­ally this year, he was among some for­mer se­nior US gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials who laid out how they thought Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den should tackle US-China ties when he as­sumes of­fice in Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, bi­lat­eral re­la­tions have sunk to their low­est point in decades. Both sides are in­creas­ingly at odds on is­sues rang­ing from se­cu­rity to trade to tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Dr Kissinger, who also spoke at the same fo­rum in Bei­jing last year, had said then that both coun­tries were in the “foothills of a cold war”.</p>
    <p>“I think we’re in the moun­tain path just now, and it’s a process that should not con­tinue,” he said on Mon­day, adding that there was a dan­ger of a “great catas­tro­phe” if both sides slipped into war and con­flict.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den would need to open a path of di­a­logue with the Chi­nese lead­er­ship, he said, adding that both sides need to agree that “what­ever other con­flict they have, they will not re­sort to mil­i­tary con­flict”.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries should also create an “in­sti­tu­tional sys­tem” where each pres­i­dent ap­points a spe­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive to re­main in con­tact on be­half of their pres­i­dents, he said.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing agreed to avoid the pos­si­bil­ity of war, both sides can “move to­wards is­sues we should achieve”, he added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, fo­rum co-chair­man Henry Paulson, a for­mer US trea­sury sec­re­tary, said Wash­ing­ton needed to adopt a new ap­proach to deal­ing with China, which he called “tar­geted rec­i­proc­ity”.</p>
    <p>“We need rec­i­proc­ity tar­geted, not at any­thing and ev­ery­thing China does; in­stead, the US should aim its de­mands for rec­i­proc­ity at sec­tors and ar­eas where Amer­ica is the strong­est and most com­pet­i­tive,” he said, adding that a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion should link tar­iff roll­backs based on ex­tract­ing re­cip­ro­cal ben­e­fits from China.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, he pointed out that China has re­sisted World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion ne­go­ti­a­tions to lift tar­iffs on en­vi­ron­men­tal goods and ser­vices, which has made it dif­fi­cult for US firms seek­ing to en­ter China to help clean up its pol­luted en­vi­ron­ment, a US$3 tril­lion (S$4 tril­lion) busi­ness op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>He also said that it was in the in­ter­est of Amer­i­cans, Chi­nese – the world’s two largest economies – and the world, that the US and China find “a way to re­boot global eco­nomic growth” in the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Com­pe­ti­tion with­out un­nec­es­sary con­fronta­tion should be our goal, be­cause con­fronta­tion with­out ef­fec­tive com­pe­ti­tion has pro­duced some poor re­sults for the Amer­i­can peo­ple,” Mr Paulson said.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing a sep­a­rate ad­dress, Chi­nese Vice-Pres­i­dent Wang Qis­han said Bei­jing was “pre­pared to ex­pand the con­flu­ence of in­ter­ests with other coun­tries”, and con­tinue to open the Chi­nese mar­ket to the world.</p>
    <p>While Mr Wang did not ref­er­ence the US di­rectly dur­ing his nine-minute speech, he called on coun­tries to rise above exclusive blocs and re­ject a “zero-sum men­tal­ity”. He said: “We are well aware that in to­day’s world, in­ter­ests of all coun­tries are closely in­ter­twined. China will do well only when the world does well, and when China does well, the whole world will ben­e­fit.”</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion with­out un­nec­es­sary con­fronta­tion should be our goal, be­cause con­fronta­tion with­out ef­fec­tive com­pe­ti­tion has pro­duced some poor re­sults for the Amer­i­can peo­ple.</p>
    <p>MR HENRY PAULSON, co-chair­man of the Bloomberg New Econ­omy Fo­rum and for­mer US trea­sury sec­re­tary.</p>
