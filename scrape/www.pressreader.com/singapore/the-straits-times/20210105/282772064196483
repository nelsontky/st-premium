    <p>• The Grand Tour’s Jeremy Clark­son (left), who re­vealed on Sun­day that he con­tracted Covid-19 four days be­fore Christ­mas, thought he was go­ing to die.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause I am 60 and fat, and be­cause I’ve smoked half a mil­lion cig­a­rettes and had dou­ble pneu­mo­nia, I’d prob­a­bly die, on my own, in a lonely plas­tic tent,” the host of the mo­tor­ing TV se­ries said i n his typ­i­cal opin­ion­ated man­ner in a col­umn for Bri­tish news­pa­per The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>He said his breath­ing be­came laboured and he had a con­stant dry cough.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to lie – it was quite scary. With ev­ery ill­ness I’ve had, there has al­ways been a sense that medicine and time would even­tu­ally ride to the res­cue.</p>
    <p>“But with Covid-19 you have to lie there, on your own, know­ing that medicine is not on its way and that time is your worst en­emy,” he said.</p>
    <p>As Bri­tain ex­pe­ri­ences a new wave of daily in­fec­tions due to an ag­gres­sive strain of the virus, yet an­other Bri­tish celebrity, co­me­dian John Bishop, 53, has re­vealed that he too had con­tracted it.</p>
    <p>Bishop and his wife tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Christ­mas Day.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing fit – he once com­pleted a 470km triathlon from Paris to London for char­ity – and a non-smoker, he said he had been “flat­tened by the virus”.</p>
    <p>In the United States, talk show host Larry King (left, be­low) has re­port­edly also been hos­pi­talised for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>King, 87, had suf­fered a num­ber of health is­sues over the past years, in­clud­ing angina, a heart at­tack and lung can­cer.</p>
    <p>He has been bat­tling the virus for al­most two weeks and his fam­ily mem­bers have not been able to see him as he is in iso­la­tion.</p>
