    <p>He was con­stantly steal­ing from his fam­ily mem­bers, be it a cell­phone, a lap­top or even hard-earned sav­ings, and then one day he brought drugs home.</p>
    <p>That was the last straw for na­tional wrestler Danielle Lim, who fi­nally plucked up the courage to re­port her elder brother to the po­lice five years ago. Ms Lim, 22, said: “My younger sis­ter, who was 12 then, was at home and I didn’t want her to see him tak­ing drugs.”</p>
    <p>Her brother, who is four years older, was her hero and she looked up to him. Re­port­ing him to the au­thor­i­ties in 2015 was a de­ci­sion that took courage and con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up, the two older sib­lings were close. Their fa­ther had a fiery tem­per, i nflamed by al­co­holism, and was abu­sive to­wards his wife and three chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said her brother al­ways tried his best to shield her from the beat­ings, and bore the brunt of their fa­ther’s anger when­ever pos­si­ble. The lit­tlest things trig­gered their fa­ther. Once, when Ms Lim was about eight, she was squab­bling with her brother over some jelly they had dropped on the floor.</p>
    <p>“Dad told us to lick the jelly off the floor, and go down­stairs to the bas­ket­ball court and stand there as pu­n­ish­ment, even though it was rain­ing re­ally heav­ily,” she said.</p>
    <p>Such in­ci­dents brought the two sib­lings closer. In those days, when she was in St An­thony’s Canos­sian Pri­mary School, she would skip school to hang out with him.</p>
    <p>In 2005, her fa­ther left the fam­ily. Her mother, a Filipino who is on a long-term so­cial visit pass, worked at places such as Dunkin’ Donuts to sup­port her­self and the chil­dren.</p>
    <p>They lived in a four-room flat in Chai Chee and the neigh­bours helped her fam­ily get through the rough patch, Ms Lim said. “What we had wasn’t enough, but our neigh­bours would of­ten cook for us. We are re­ally very grate­ful to them.”</p>
    <p>But Ms Lim and her brother were still skip­ping school.</p>
    <p>Later, in St An­thony’s Canos­sian Sec­ondary School, she was con­sis­tently bot­tom of her co­hort, though she was an ac­tive stu­dent ath­lete who rep­re­sented the school in sports, in­clud­ing track and field and hand­ball. “I didn’t care. I went for my ex­ams without know­ing what pa­per I was sit­ting. The only rea­son I even took the ex­ams was that I didn’t want to have to spend money on a med­i­cal cer­tifi­cate if I was ab­sent.”</p>
    <p>Life car­ried on this way un­til she was 16. “At first, it was all about fun. I had no aims or goals and I didn’t know what I wanted in life. Break­ing the rules made me feel there was some­thing in my life I could have con­trol over,” she said.</p>
    <p>But when her brother joined a gang, she be­came afraid. “I started to think of the con­se­quences of his ac­tions. He be­came numb – he never felt bad about hit­ting some­one.”</p>
    <p>When she tried to talk to him, they ended up quar­relling. “Af­ter that, he turned his back on me. My brother was my hero. But he be­came some­one I didn’t recog­nise any more,” she said.</p>
    <p>A re­mark from a teacher in 2014 served as a wake-up call for her. “My teacher said that if just a lit­tle of the ef­fort I put into sports went to my stud­ies, I would do well.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim de­cided to try but the N lev­els were just two weeks away. “It was crazy. Ev­ery­one was study­ing so hard. They had all al­ready com­pleted their 10-year series books, when I had not even bought one.”</p>
    <p>She sought her teach­ers’ help. Ev­ery day, she ar­rived at school when it opened at 5.30am and stayed un­til the gates closed. Her ef­forts paid off and she passed with 18 points.</p>
    <p>N-level students can go to the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE), ei­ther di­rectly or through the Di­rect En­try Scheme to Polytech­nic Pro­gramme. They also have the op­tion to con­tinue to Sec­ondary 5 and take the O-level ex­ams.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said her teach­ers ad­vised her to take the ITE route – they said she seemed “more suited” for it. But she chose to con­tinue to Sec 5.</p>
    <p>“I was stub­born. The more they said I couldn’t take the O lev­els, the more I wanted to do it. I told my­self that if I put my heart and soul into it, I could suc­ceed.”</p>
    <p>Us­ing the same strat­egy she did in the run-up to the N lev­els, she scored 12 points for the O lev­els. It sur­prised ev­ery­one. The ex­pe­ri­ence made her re­alise she could do any­thing she put her mind to.</p>
    <p>She car­ried this mind­set all the way to Repub­lic Polytech­nic (RP), where she stud­ied sports coach­ing. It was also where she dis­cov­ered a tal­ent – and pas­sion – for wrestling.</p>
    <p>In 2017, dur­ing her first year in RP, she was as­signed to ob­serve a wrestling coach at a train­ing ses­sion. See­ing Ms Lim’s in­ter­est, he asked her to try her hand at lift­ing some­one. He then in­vited her to join the next three ses­sions, and asked her to have a go at an up­com­ing lo­cal meet.</p>
    <p>She agreed. With just 11 days of prac­tice and one ba­sic wrestling tech­nique, she won her first medal. The coach said she had po­ten­tial and sug­gested she con­tinue train­ing with him. She later joined the na­tional de­vel­op­ment team, and last year she made the na­tional team.</p>
    <p>She said of wrestling: “It makes me feel like I am em­pow­er­ing my­self. When the whis­tle blows, it’s just me and my op­po­nent on the mat. No one con­trols the re­sults but me. Ev­ery­thing is in the mind.”</p>
    <p>So far, Ms Lim has rep­re­sented Sin­ga­pore at nine com­pe­ti­tions in coun­tries in­clud­ing China and Thai­land. She has won six medals.</p>
    <p>Now a first-year physiother­apy stu­dent at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (SIT), she has re­ceived the Sin­ga­pore Olympic Foun­da­tion-Peter Lim Schol­ar­ship, as well as an SIT schol­ar­ship to help de­fray costs. Last month, she was awarded a schol­ar­ship from Evolve Mixed Mar­tial Arts, which in­cludes $10,000 in cash.</p>
    <p>She also re­ceives bur­saries of over $6,000 yearly from the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and North West Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>On the wrestling front, she is train­ing hard in the hope of rep­re­sent­ing Sin­ga­pore at the SEA Games and the Asian Games, as well as, one day, the Olympic Games.</p>
    <p>She cred­its her mother, Ms Claire Berani, 52, for stick­ing by them.</p>
    <p>“Mum could have left home when she wasn’t wanted, but she stayed. No mat­ter how naughty we were, she kept on be­ing strong.”</p>
    <p>That was among the rea­sons Ms Lim de­cided to pull up her socks in sec­ondary school. “I didn’t want to be an­other prob­lem for her.”</p>
    <p>Ms Berani is the fam­ily’s main bread­win­ner, and cur­rently draws $1,400 a month as a helper in a sa­tay kitchen. The fam­ily has since moved from Chai Chee to a flat in Yishun, which is fully paid for.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Berani. “This girl is very in­de­pen­dent. When she wants to do some­thing, she doesn’t stop un­til she gets it done. She al­ways tells me, ‘Mum, don’t worry, I’ll give you a good life some day.’</p>
    <p>“And I tell her, ‘Keep go­ing, I’m al­ways be­hind you, never give up.’”</p>
    <p>But Ms Lim has not spo­ken to her brother since she turned him in to the po­lice. They are “in dif­fer­ent places and we see the world dif­fer­ently”, she said.</p>
    <p>She has, how­ever, made up with her fa­ther, who mended his ways and re­turned home in 2016 af­ter a colon cancer scare, and now works as a Grab driver.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said: “He thought he was go­ing to die and he wanted to apol­o­gise to us be­fore it hap­pened. There’s still a bar­rier be­tween us, we don’t talk much. But I’ve for­given him. Af­ter all, he’s the one who gave me this life.”</p>
    <p>Her life ex­pe­ri­ences have taught her to “fo­cus on the things you can con­trol” and that “as long as I don’t stop try­ing, I can suc­ceed”.</p>
    <p>DRIVEN AND IN­DE­PEN­DENT</p>
    <p>This girl is very in­de­pen­dent. When she wants to do some­thing, she doesn’t stop un­til she gets it done. She al­ways tells me, ‘Mum, don’t worry, I’ll give you a good life some day.’ And I tell her, ‘Keep go­ing, I’m al­ways be­hind you, never give up.’ ’’</p>
