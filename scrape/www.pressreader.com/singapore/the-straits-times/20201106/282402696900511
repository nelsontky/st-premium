    <p>• De­spite coro­n­avirushit Kai Havertz’s last-minute pullout from Chelsea’s squad to face Rennes, Frank Lam­pard’s side showed no signs of dis­trac­tion on Wed­nes­day, run­ning out 3-0 win­ners over the 10-man Ligue 1 side at Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>The Cham­pi­ons League vic­tory, ex­tend­ing their un­beaten run in all com­pe­ti­tions to seven games, also reaf­firmed the Blues man­ager’s be­lief that his side are mak­ing steady progress fol­low­ing their £200 mil­lion-plus (S$353.6 mil­lion) out­lay on trans­fers in the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Timo Werner con­verted two spot kicks, while Tammy Abra­ham also scored, with all goals com­ing af­ter Brazil­ian de­fender Dal­bert was dis­missed for two book­able of­fences in the first half.</p>
    <p>“It shows the work we’re do­ing and di­rec­tion we’re go­ing. We did the right things in ev­ery as­pect – started well, got our goals, saw the game out and had the chance to give oth­ers min­utes later on,” Lam­pard, whose side are level with Sevilla on seven points but top Group E on goal dif­fer­ence, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“The pro­fes­sional el­e­ments of our game were good against good op­po­si­tion. We couldn’t un­der­es­ti­mate them and we saw when it was 11 v 11 that they’re a phys­i­cal, tech­ni­cal team but we won pretty well.”</p>
    <p>It was the hosts’ fifth suc­ces­sive clean sheet, the first time they have man­aged the feat since 2010 and the de­fen­sive is­sues that were ev­i­dent in the first few weeks of the term have all but dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>“I’m pleased be­cause it’s work, it’s the team, it’s play­ers that are in there con­fi­dent and fit,” Lam­pard added.</p>
    <p>On Havertz, Lam­pard said the £71 mil­lion mid­fielder would miss to­mor­row’s Pre­mier League home game with Sh­effield United and would also be a scratch for Ger­many’s up­com­ing in­ter­na­tional matches.</p>
    <p>“It showed up in the Uefa testing on Mon­day. We retested yes­ter­day when we found out,” he said. “Clearly, ev­ery­one else in the squad is neg­a­tive, so that is a good sign. I’ve spoke to Kai a cou­ple of times since we found out.</p>
    <p>“He’s try­ing to do all the right things. It’s just one of those things in the mod­ern day with where we’re at. Hope­fully, he iso­lates, does the right things and comes back fir­ing.”</p>
