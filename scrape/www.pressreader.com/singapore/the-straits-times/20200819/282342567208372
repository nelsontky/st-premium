    <p>BARCELONA • Fac­ing an in­sti­tu­tional and sport­ing cri­sis after their 8-2 Cham­pi­ons League de­feat by Bay­ern Mu­nich, Barcelona look set to re­turn to their roots by turn­ing to Ron­ald Koe­man.</p>
    <p>A cor­ner­stone of Jo­han Cruyff’s “Dream Team”, who de­liv­ered the Cata­lan gi­ants’ first Euro­pean Cup in 1992, the former Dutch in­ter­na­tional knows the club in­side out, hav­ing spent six years at the Nou Camp un­til 1995.</p>
    <p>It will be a wrench for him to leave as Nether­lands man­ager, hav­ing trans­formed the Oranje’s fortunes by qual­i­fy­ing for Euro 2020 in Novem­ber after they failed to reach both Euro 2016 and the World Cup in 2018.</p>
    <p>But such is his af­fec­tion for Barca that he has a clause in his con­tract which al­lows him to walk away should the club, where he started his coach­ing ca­reer as Louis van Gaal’s as­sis­tant in 1998, move for him.</p>
    <p>A source yes­ter­day said the club was ne­go­ti­at­ing to re­lease him from his cur­rent deal and the 57-yearold, who is pre­pared not to lead the Oranje at the post­poned Eu­ros next</p>
    <p>June, cor­rob­o­rated the news.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to reporters out­side the na­tional team’s head­quar­ters, he said: “It is only def­i­nite when my sig­na­ture is on the doc­u­ment. Un­til then, I can­not say any­thing, even if I wanted to. I didn’t ex­pect things to go so fast and it is not the best tim­ing... It’s ugly for the Dutch FA but not un­ex­pected... if it hap­pens, it would be a dream come true.”</p>
    <p>His im­mi­nent ap­point­ment comes after Barca sacked coach Quique Se­tien on Mon­day, eight months after his ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>The club also brought for­ward its pres­i­den­tial elec­tion to March, with in­cum­bent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu fac­ing widespread calls to re­sign. In April, he faced an in­ter­nal re­volt as six di­rec­tors re­signed from the board over the club’s han­dling of a scan­dal in­volv­ing a so­cial me­dia firm, which launched at­tacks on the club’s play­ers.</p>
    <p>He has also been crit­i­cised for the club’s fi­nan­cial woes, which forced Barca to cut its staff’s pay in April as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic de­spite be­ing the rich­est foot­ball side in the world, gen­er­at­ing a record €841 mil­lion (S$1.37 bil­lion) in rev­enues in the 2018-19 sea­son, ac­cord­ing to the Deloitte Money League.</p>
    <p>In An­toine Griez­mann, Ous­mane Dem­bele and Philippe Coutinho, Barca have three of the five most ex­pen­sive play­ers in his­tory – to the to­tal tune of €345 mil­lion – yet none of them have proven to be of value. The club’s reck­less spend­ing in re­cent sea­sons and fail­ure in Europe – Barca have not reached the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal since 2015 – has led to tur­moil, with cap­tain Lionel Messi said to be un­set­tled.</p>
    <p>The up­heaval fol­low­ing the Bay­ern hu­mil­i­a­tion con­tin­ued yes­ter­day as Barca sacked sport­ing di­rec­tor and former de­fender Eric Abidal. An of­fi­cial state­ment read: “The club would pub­licly like to thank Eric Abidal for his pro­fes­sion­al­ism, com­mit­ment, ded­i­ca­tion, and the close and pos­i­tive na­ture of his re­la­tion­ship with all as­pects of the Barca fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>When Koe­man takes on the Barca job, he will be charged with re­vi­tal­is­ing a club en­dur­ing its first tro­phy­less sea­son since 2008. He will also need to win over the naysay­ers.</p>
    <p>Many La Liga fans re­mem­ber his time at Va­len­cia, where he was fired in 2008 after less than a full sea­son as they fin­ished just above the drop zone. A poll con­ducted by Span­ish daily El Mundo De­portivo re­ported that 70 per cent of 11,000 re­spon­dents were against his ap­point­ment. His last stint in club foot­ball also ended in ig­nominy, with Ever­ton fir­ing him in 2017, barely 16 months into the job.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, No. 1 goal­keeper Marc-An­dre ter Ste­gen will miss the start of next sea­son after un­der­go­ing knee surgery. His three-month ab­sence will be a blow, with ques­tion marks lin­ger­ing over the fu­tures of stal­warts Jordi Alba, Ger­ard Pique, Luis Suarez, Messi and Ser­gio Bus­quets.</p>
    <p>With so many unan­swered ques­tions, some crit­ics be­lieve Koe­man is merely a seat warmer for club great Xavi to take over.</p>
    <p>Span­ish foot­ball expert Gra­ham Hunter be­lieves Bar­tomeu will be re­placed by Vic­tor Font, who is “ab­so­lutely com­mit­ted to bring­ing in” the man­ager of Qatari side Al Sadd.</p>
    <p>“This is cur­rently a one-year shot,” he told Sky Sports. “Koe­man is be­ing told he can have a two-year deal, which ef­fec­tively seems to mean a year of work and al­most cer­tainly a year of com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“Xavi won’t come in the mean time, so... that’s why Koe­man fits all those boxes (for now).”</p>
    <p>NIGHT­MARE FOR DUTCH FA</p>
    <p>It’s ugly for the Dutch FA but not un­ex­pected... if it hap­pens, it would be a dream come true. ’’</p>
    <p>RON­ALD KOE­MAN, the Nether­lands man­ager, ad­mit­ting his de­sire to take charge of Barcelona. The Dutch­man helped the Oranje qual­ify for Euro 2020 but will not be able to lead them at the post­poned com­pe­ti­tion next June.</p>
