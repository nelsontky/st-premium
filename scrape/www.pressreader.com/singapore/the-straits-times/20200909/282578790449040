    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • For­mer foot­ball star David Beck­ham and his wife, fash­ion de­signer Vic­to­ria Beck­ham, have joined the list of celebri­ties who have been in­fected by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Sun, the Bri­tish celebrity cou­ple likely caught the bug dur­ing their stay in Los An­ge­les in March.</p>
    <p>Quot­ing un­named sources, the Bri­tish tabloid said Beck­ham, 45, and Vic­to­ria, 46, flew to the United States on March 1 to cheer for his foot­ball club, In­ter Mi­ami, which was play­ing its first away game at Los An­ge­les Foot­ball Club.</p>
    <p>They were j oined by celebrity chef Gor­don Ram­say and other mem­bers of the Beck­ham fam­ily, in­clud­ing their son Brook­lyn’s fi­ancee, ac­tress Ni­cola Peltz.</p>
    <p>An un­named friend was quoted by The Sun as say­ing: “They at­tended a cou­ple of swanky net­work­ing events as David had pro­mo­tional du­ties, and were shak­ing hands and kiss­ing fans and var­i­ous club dig­ni­taries.”</p>
    <p>The fam­ily then re­turned to London a few days later to at­tend Brook­lyn’s 21st birthday party, which was at­tended by celebri­ties such as Spice Girl Emma Bun­ton and rap­per Stor­mzy. The Beck­hams re­turned to Mi­ami shortly af­ter the cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>The friend said David Beck­ham, a for­mer player of Manch­ester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy, be­gan to feel ill af­ter their re­turn to the US, with his wife hav­ing a sore throat and high tem­per­a­ture. They were later di­ag­nosed with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The source added that the fam­ily’s driv­ers, body­guards and as­sis­tants also fell ill at about the same time.</p>
    <p>The friend said Vic­to­ria Beck­ham, also a mem­ber of Spice Girls, quar­an­tined the fam­ily for more than two weeks as she was wor­ried they could be su­per-spread­ers.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple went for swab tests to con­firm they were not in­fec­tious be­fore trav­el­ling to Italy and Greece for hol­i­days in July and last month.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s spokes­men de­clined to com­ment on The Sun’s story.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Amer­i­can ac­tor Michael Rooker, 65, con­firmed on so­cial me­dia that he has re­cov­ered from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Rooker, who is fa­mous for play­ing Yondu in the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies (2014 and 2017) and Merle Dixon in TV se­ries The Walk­ing Dead (2010 to present), posted a photo of his neg­a­tive re­sult last Fri­day. He told fans he had won the “epic bat­tle” against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Other celebri­ties who have con­tracted the coro­n­avirus in­clude ac­tor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wil­son, Bri­tish ac­tor Idris Elba, wrestler-turned-ac­tor Dwayne “The Rock” John­son, Twi­light (2008 to 2012) star Robert Pat­tin­son and Brave­heart (1995) ac­tor Mel Gib­son.</p>
