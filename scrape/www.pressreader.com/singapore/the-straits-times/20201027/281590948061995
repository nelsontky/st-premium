    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s fac­tory out­put might be a bright spot in the econ­omy, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board. Man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put surged 24.2 per cent in Septem­ber, com­pared with the same month last year – the big­gest year-on-year in­crease since De­cem­ber 2011.</p>

    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s fac­tory out­put might be a bright spot in the econ­omy, thanks to the boom­ing phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and elec­tron­ics sec­tors, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased yes­ter­day by the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board (EDB).</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put surged 24.2 per cent last month, com­pared with the same month last year – the big­gest year-on-year in­crease since De­cem­ber 2011.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing biomed­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing, out­put grew 8.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Biomed­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­duc­tion ex­panded by 89.8 per cent year on year. Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal out­put swelled 113.6 per cent with higher out­put of ac­tive phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­gre­di­ents and bi­o­log­i­cal prod­ucts, while the med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy seg­ment grew 15 per cent with higher ex­port de­mand for med­i­cal in­stru­ments. On a year-to-date ba­sis, the biomed­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing clus­ter grew 26.6 per cent com­pared with the same pe­riod a year ago.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics sec­tor also posted ro­bust growth – 30.1 per cent last month. This was led by the semi­con­duc­tor seg­ment, which grew 37.4 per cent, sup­ported by de­mand from cloud ser­vices, data cen­tres and the 5G mar­ket, EDB noted.</p>
    <p>The de­mand for chips re­mains strong, economists noted.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling said: “Elec­tron­ics con­tin­ues to ben­e­fit from the semi­con­duc­tor up­turn, with work-from-home ar­range­ments driv­ing de­mand for cloud com­put­ing and data cen­tres. Driv­ers also in­clude new iPhone launches and 5G in­tro­duc­tion.”</p>
    <p>Chem­i­cals also saw a slight in­crease in out­put, by 0.4 per cent. The spe­cial­i­ties seg­ment grew with higher out­put in in­dus­trial gases and ad­di­tives. But the petro­chem­i­cals and pe­tro­leum seg­ments con­tracted on the back of plant main­te­nance shut­downs.</p>
    <p>The trans­port en­gi­neer­ing clus­ter recorded a 35.8 per cent plunge in out­put last month.</p>
    <p>Growth in the land seg­ment was off­set by sharp de­clines in marine and off­shore en­gi­neer­ing and aero­space, as new or­ders were ad­versely im­pacted by the weak global oil and gas mar­ket and coro­n­avirus-led travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing clus­ter recorded a drop in out­put of 1.5 per cent last month, with the ma­chin­ery and sys­tems seg­ment dip­ping 0.7 per cent. But over­all, the clus­ter grew 10 per cent from Jan­uary to last month.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put also fell, by 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>On a sea­son­ally ad­justed mon­thon-month ba­sis, man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put in­creased 10.1 per cent. Ex­clud­ing biomed­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing, it dipped 1.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Growth is ex­pected to re­main un­even across dif­fer­ent clus­ters and seg­ments, as some such as trans­port en­gi­neer­ing were hard hit by the out­break.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said: “Low oil prices which is ex­pected for the rest of 2020 will likely de­press the chem­i­cals and trans­port en­gi­neer­ing clus­ters. Mean­while, Covid-19-re­lated fac­tors may con­tinue to weigh on the gen­eral man­u­fac­tur­ing clus­ter.”</p>
    <p>But some seg­ments are ex­pected to con­tinue to per­form well due to firm de­mand con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng an­a­lysts Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye said: “Sin­ga­pore is ben­e­fit­ing from the pan­demic-in­duced de­mand for semi­con­duc­tors, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“Man­u­fac­tur­ing is ex­cep­tion­ally re­silient in this pan­demic re­ces­sion as sup­ply chains and trade flows faced only tem­po­rary dis­rup­tions... Global stock­pil­ing of medicine and drug in­gre­di­ents by com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ments to en­sure suf­fi­cient sup­plies is driv­ing the surge.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said: “Bar­ring height­ened or pro­tracted un­cer­tain­ties aris­ing from the up­com­ing Amer­i­can elec­tion for in­stance, or ma­jor economies go­ing back into lock­down to con­tain the resur­gent Covid-19 waves, it looks like the do­mes­tic man­u­fac­tur­ing en­gine should be the key out­per­former for the rest of the year for the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics con­tin­ues to ben­e­fit from the semi­con­duc­tor up­turn, with work-from-home ar­range­ments driv­ing de­mand for cloud com­put­ing and data cen­tres.</p>
