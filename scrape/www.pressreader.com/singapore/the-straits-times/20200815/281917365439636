    <p>• North Korean leader Kim Jong Un re­placed the premier he named about a year ago and lifted a lock­down on the bor­der city of Kaesong, put in place on con­cerns that a former de­fec­tor who crossed back from South Korea brought the coron­avirus with him.</p>
    <p>The moves an­nounced in state me­dia re­ports yes­ter­day come as North Korea is fac­ing flood­ing that is set to wipe out farm­land and deal an­other blow to its al­ready stag­ger­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The premier is seen as a stew­ard of eco­nomic man­age­ment and nam­ing Mr Kim Tok Hun to the post to re­place Mr Kim Jae Ry­ong could de­flect blame off the North Korean leader for any hard­ships com­ing from a poor har­vest.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial Korean Cen­tral News Agency (KCNA) re­port said “Kim Jae Ry­ong was re­lieved from the premier­ship”. Mr Kim Tok Hun is a senior cadre who serves as the head of the par­lia­men­tary bud­get com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>“The North Korean econ­omy is fac­ing a se­ri­ous chal­lenge now and some­one had to take po­lit­i­cal re­spon­si­bil­ity,” said Mr Choi Kang, vice-pres­i­dent of the Asan In­sti­tute for Pol­icy Stud­ies in Seoul. “This looks like a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure to off­set com­plaints from North Korean peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kim Jong Un said at a Work­ers’ Party polit­buro meet­ing that flood­ing has taken a toll but North Korea should not ac­cept for­eign aid be­cause of the coron­avirus risk, KCNA said.</p>
    <p>North Korea has said it does not have any coron­avirus cases, and placed Kaesong on lock­down last month after the former de­fec­tor crossed into the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The leader “de­cided to lift the lock­down of Kaesong city based on sci­en­tific ev­i­dence”, KCNA added, not­ing that he also or­dered mea­sures to fur­ther sup­port flood vic­tims.</p>
    <p>North Korea has been hit by flood­ing since ear­lier this month, as tor­ren­tial rain threat­ens to wipe out farm­land and the virus-dam­aged econ­omy heads for what might be its big­gest con­trac­tion in more than two decades.</p>
    <p>The flood­ing has also im­pacted its Yong­byon nu­clear fa­cil­ity, with wa­ters reach­ing pump houses for moth­balled re­ac­tors, the 38 North web­site said based on an anal­y­sis of satel­lite im­agery.</p>
    <p>Agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion is a key el­e­ment of North Korea’s econ­omy and flood­ing in its sum­mer months has led to a di­min­ished har­vest, putting strain on Mr Kim as he bat­tles global sanctions put in place to pun­ish the state for its nu­clear and bal­lis­tic mis­sile test­ing.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions World Food Pro­gramme, which has op­er­a­tions in North Korea, has said about 40 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion is un­der­nour­ished, adding that “food in­se­cu­rity and mal­nu­tri­tion are wide­spread”.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to dam­age to farm­land, Mr Kim’s de­ci­sion to shut bor­ders in Jan­uary due to the coron­avirus slammed the brakes on the lit­tle le­gal trade the state has, and could send the econ­omy this year into its big­gest con­trac­tion since 1997, ac­cord­ing to Fitch So­lu­tions.</p>
