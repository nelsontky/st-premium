    <p>Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion yes­ter­day said the fed­eral bud­get tabled by the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion lacked a clear di­rec­tion for eco­nomic re­cov­ery post-pan­demic, as sev­eral bi­par­ti­san de­mands made by the op­po­si­tion re­mained un­ful­filled in the bud­get.</p>
    <p>Its crit­i­cisms raise the ques­tion whether the op­po­si­tion will back the “Unity Bud­get”, as re­peat­edly called by the Malaysian King.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim said the gov­ern­ment’s rev­enue pro­jec­tion was “wor­ry­ing” and its lack of di­rec­tion for an eco­nomic re­cov­ery plan is the “big­gest weak­ness” of the RM322 bil­lion (S$105 bil­lion) bud­get which was pre­sented by Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz.</p>
    <p>“This bud­get does not por­tray how we can stim­u­late and de­velop the econ­omy, and also does not ad­dress the is­sue of un­em­ploy­ment and those who have lost their jobs,” Datuk Seri An­war said in a Face­book video shortly af­ter the bud­get was tabled.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s col­league in Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat, MP Wong Chen, said on Twit­ter: “The Min­istry of Fi­nance, in terms of money al­lo­cated, ig­nored the bulk of six key Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) rec­om­men­da­tions. Is this say­onara to the Unity Bud­get idea?”</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion PH coali­tion made six rec­om­men­da­tions to be in­cluded in the bud­get, and Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party sec­re­tary-gen­eral Lim Guan Eng pre­vi­ously warned that its sup­port for the bud­get hinges on the in­clu­sion of the rec­om­men­da­tions, chief among those a rein­tro­duc­tion of a blan­ket mora­to­rium on bank loans.</p>
    <p>Umno, a mem­ber of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion, had also made a sim­i­lar de­mand to ex­tend the loan mora­to­rium.</p>
    <p>But the bud­get pre­sented had only pro­vi­sions for tar­geted loan as­sis­tance fo­cused mostly on low­in­come house­holds.</p>
    <p>The PN gov­ern­ment con­trols 113 seats in the 222-strong Malaysian Par­lia­ment, giv­ing it a pre­car­i­ous two-seat ma­jor­ity to pass the cru­cial bud­get, if it chooses to do so with­out back­ing from the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, has urged all Malaysian MPs to lend bi­par­ti­san sup­port and pass the bud­get as Malaysia bat­tles the coro­n­avirus, with a record 1,755 new cases logged yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs se­nior fel­low Oh Ei Sun said that mod­i­fi­ca­tions could still be made to the bud­get to en­sure that all par­ties are able to agree and pass the cru­cial ex­pen­di­ture Bill.</p>
    <p>“In the days to come, amend­ments would likely be made to ac­com­mo­date such seem­ingly bi­par­ti­san, al­beit pop­ulist, pro­pos­als such that the bud­get Bill could be smoothly passed,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
