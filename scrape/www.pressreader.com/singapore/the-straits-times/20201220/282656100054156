    <p>SOFT SKILLS KEEP YOU GO­ING</p>
    <p>We have heard many times that ‘the work is man­age­able, but you know, it’s the peo­ple la’. What­ever job we are in, it is in­evitable that we will en­counter dif­fi­cult mo­ments with peo­ple. Some­times, we quit be­cause of in­abil­ity to han­dle peo­ple is­sues. Yes, hard skills are im­por­tant, but soft skills are equally, if not more, im­por­tant. Hard skills get you started, but it’s the soft skills that get you go­ing.</p>

    <p>TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH</p>
    <p>MS JANUS CHAN, 47, life coach at Janus Coach­ing Space.</p>
    <p>Once you’ve grad­u­ated, if you don’t think you’re ready, take some time to get a full-time job in a start-up and learn as much as pos­si­ble. And when you can, take the leap of faith and start your en­trepreneur­ship jour­ney. When you throw your­self into the deep­est end of the pool, you see your­self learn­ing a lot faster. The longer you wait, the more you pro­cras­ti­nate.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>EVAL­U­ATE PRI­OR­I­TIES</p>
    <p>MR JOSHUA YAP, 26, chief ex­ec­u­tive of lo­cal start-up Open Cir­cles.</p>
    <p>Eval­u­ate what your pri­or­i­ties are at this stage of your life. Find out whether you want to fo­cus on learn­ing hor­i­zon­tally for more breadth or ver­ti­cally for more depth, and find out what you can truly ex­cel in. In an ideal world, you should love what you do, and that should also be the thing that brings in the money. But prac­ti­cally speak­ing, not ev­ery­one finds pas­sion eas­ily. And it’s okay.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>BE ADAPT­ABLE AND VALU­ABLE</p>
    <p>MS SHIRLEY CRYS­TAL CHUA, 41, founder of per­sonal fi­nance plat­form The Sim­ple Sum and group CEO of hold­ing group Golden Equa­tor.</p>
    <p>We live in times where job se­cu­rity is quickly evap­o­rat­ing. Sin­ga­pore­ans will need to com­pete with other coun­tries... (Sin­ga­pore’s) past per­for­mance does not guar­an­tee fu­ture suc­cess, and we’re the gen­er­a­tion that will make or break Sin­ga­pore. There are lim­ited things our gov­ern­ment can do to pro­tect and shel­ter us. The best thing you can do for your­self is to be adapt­able to change and to al­ways be valu­able so you can thrive any­where in the world. You are go­ing to need skills, knowl­edge and money for that. We’re still young, let’s make hay while the sun shines.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>HAVE BAL­ANCED, SUS­TAIN­ABLE HABITS</p>
    <p>MR HE RUIMING AND MR GOH WEI CHOON, both 31, founders of per­sonal fi­nance blog The Woke Salary­man.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple don’t do well in their ca­reers, not be­cause they do not put in the re­quired level of ef­fort and fo­cus, but be­cause the other im­por­tant ar­eas of their life are ne­glected. Once that bal­ance is lost, we can get de­pressed and stressed. The first step of ca­reer build­ing is to have bal­anced and sus­tain­able habits so that your ca­reer can be long term. A ca­reer is a ’’ marathon, not a sprint.</p>
    <p>MR XAVIER FOK, 32, co-founder and chair­man of dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing firm Ally Media.</p>
