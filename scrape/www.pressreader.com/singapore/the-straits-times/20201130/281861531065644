    <p>John Adams, the first Amer­i­can pres­i­dent to lose a re-elec­tion, made a quiet de­par­ture in 1801. He got on an early morn­ing stage­coach to avoid hav­ing to at­tend the inau­gu­ra­tion of his suc­ces­sor Thomas Jef­fer­son. Mr Don­ald Trump, the 10th United States pres­i­dent to be de­nied a sec­ond term, could do like­wise and slip out of of­fice without con­ced­ing his loss. No le­gal storm will en­sue. On Dec 14, the Elec­toral Col­lege will for­mally cast votes af­firm­ing Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den’s win and clear the way for his inau­gu­ra­tion on Jan 20. Only af­ter that will Mr Trump’s omis­sion of a tra­di­tional con­ces­sion speech come to bite Mr Bi­den, widen­ing the gap be­tween Amer­i­cans and their new pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In a democ­racy, and es­pe­cially the US, where grid­locks are re­solved through com­pro­mise, the loser’s words do count and can de­ter­mine how well the win­ner pre­vails. Mr Trump won 10 mil­lion more votes in this elec­tion than in 2016. As count­ing con­tin­ues af­ter the record Nov 3 turnout, Mr Bi­den has more than 80 mil­lion votes, the high­est in US his­tory. Mr Trump’s tally has crossed 73 mil­lion, the sec­ond-high­est. The ob­verse side of this feat is that Mr Bi­den will be left to con­tend with the most num­ber of Amer­i­cans whose af­fec­tion he has to vie for. A ma­jor­ity of Repub­li­can vot­ers – nearly 75 per cent – say the elec­tion was “stolen” from Mr Trump. With an eye to keep­ing the base mo­bilised ahead of Georgia’s</p>
    <p>Jan 5 se­na­to­rial run-off elec­tions, the Repub­li­can Party has not chal­lenged Mr Trump’s con­tin­ued nar­ra­tive of hav­ing been cheated of a vic­tory. His sup­port­ers clutch at con­tra­dic­tory be­liefs – that there was fraud harm­ing his chances while ac­cept­ing Repub­li­can vic­to­ries in Congress and other races from those same bal­lots. No ev­i­dence has emerged of wide­spread fraud and Mr Trump’s at­tempts to over­turn re­sults have been dis­missed by judges and elec­tion of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>But the pro­longed tran­si­tion, a carry-over from when the win­ner needed weeks to ar­rive in the cap­i­tal, is not without costs. The weeks of re­counts and court bat­tles af­ter the 2000 elec­tion hurt the gov­ern­ment’s abil­ity to pre­vent the 9/11 ter­ror­ist at­tacks. In the four months that Abra­ham Lin­coln waited in 1861, sev­eral southern states se­ceded and this fu­elled the Amer­i­can Civil War. And as Franklin D. Roo­sevelt waited to take over from Her­bert Hoover in 1933, ef­forts against the Great De­pres­sion slack­ened.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who must dash to tackle the pan­demic and the econ­omy, has wisely avoided ril­ing the Repub­li­cans to shore up the sup­port he needs to ap­point his Cab­i­net and pass a stim­u­lus plan. He has not pressed Mr Trump for a con­ces­sion. But in the na­tional in­ter­est, Mr Trump can leave his suc­ces­sor with no bet­ter part­ing gift than to ac­knowl­edge that Mr Bi­den won fairly. Such words will al­low Amer­ica’s bit­ter par­ti­san di­vide to heal.</p>
