    <p>Google suf­fered a seven-hour global out­age yes­ter­day that af­fected many of its ser­vices, in­clud­ing e-mail, stor­age, doc­u­ments and video­con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>The dis­rup­tion hit users at a time when they needed the tools most to stay pro­duc­tive amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Many users, in­clud­ing those in Sin­ga­pore, could not log in to their Gmail ac­counts while some could not send or re­ceive at­tach­ments.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers could not cre­ate files in their Google Drive, post mes­sages via Google Chat or record Meet video­con­fer­enc­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to third-party Web mon­i­tor­ing com­pany DownDe­tec­tor, prob­lems with Google ser­vices were first re­ported around noon yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>DownDe­tec­tor also recorded reports from around 10,000 af­fected users here, with the ma­jor­ity re­port­ing prob­lems log­ging in to their Gmail ac­counts and send­ing and re­ceiv­ing e-mail at­tach­ments.</p>
    <p>A live out­age world map by the same com­pany showed that is­sues were mostly re­ported in Ja­pan, In­dia, parts of the United States, Europe and South-east Asian coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ms Diana Low, an ac­count di­rec­tor with lo­cal cre­ative agency Splash Pro­duc­tions, said that she could not send at­tach­ments with her e-mails on Gmail from 2pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The e-mail text goes through, but the at­tach­ments don’t. My col­leagues all ex­pe­ri­enced the same thing,” she said.</p>
    <p>Google con­firmed on its web­site at 1.29pm yes­ter­day that it was in­ves­ti­gat­ing an is­sue with Gmail.</p>
    <p>At 3.21pm, the com­pany up­dated that ad­vi­sory, say­ing that it was in­ves­ti­gat­ing is­sues with Gmail send­ing, Meet record­ing, and cre­at­ing files in Drive, among other things.</p>
    <p>At about 7pm, Google re­ported that ser­vices were re­stored. A check on the sta­tus dash­board of its ser­vices on the com­pany web­site also showed that all were func­tion­ing nor­mally by then.</p>
    <p>Apol­o­gis­ing for the in­con­ve­nience caused, Google said on its web­site: “Sys­tem re­li­a­bil­ity is a top pri­or­ity at Google. We are mak­ing con­tin­u­ous im­prove­ments to make our sys­tems bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The tech gi­ant did not re­spond by press time to ques­tions about the cause of the dis­rup­tion and its re­dun­dancy plans.</p>
    <p>Mr Loo Wee Teck, global head of con­sumer elec­tron­ics at mar­ket re­search firm Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional, said: “The out­age serves as a timely re­minder to com­pa­nies not to rely on one com­pany – even if it saves them money – for their dig­i­tal ser­vices needs, but to mit­i­gate the risk of one fail­ing by go­ing with a few com­pa­nies or plat­forms.”</p>
