    <p>WASHINGTON The au­thor­i­ties in the US have ar­rested a per­son sus­pected of send­ing the deadly poison ricin in an envelope ad­dressed to the White House but intercepte­d be­fore it could be de­liv­ered, a law en­force­ment source has said.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a Reuters query seek­ing con­fir­ma­tion of me­dia re­ports that a wo­man ac­cused of mail­ing the ricin-tainted let­ter had been taken into cus­tody at the US-Cana­dian bor­der, the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fice in Washington is­sued a state­ment on Sun­day say­ing: “An ar­rest was made of an in­di­vid­ual al­legedly re­spon­si­ble for send­ing a sus­pi­cious let­ter.”</p>
    <p>The state­ment added: “The in­ves­ti­ga­tion is on­go­ing.”</p>
    <p>The law en­force­ment source, fa­mil­iar with the case but speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, told Reuters the “sus­pi­cious let­ter” re­ferred to in the FBI state­ment was the same as the envelope found to have con­tained ricin. The source also said the per­son ar­rested was a wo­man of Cana­dian cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>The Royal Cana­dian Mounted Po­lice (RCMP) said last Satur­day that it had re­ceived a re­quest for as­sis­tance from the FBI in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion and that the sus­pi­cious let­ter in ques­tion ap­peared to have been sent from Canada.</p>
    <p>The RCMP fur­ther stated that an FBI anal­y­sis of a sub­stance in­side the envelope de­tected “the pres­ence of ricin”, a highly toxic agent de­rived from cas­tor beans.</p>
    <p>While nat­u­rally oc­cur­ring, the toxin re­quires a de­lib­er­ate act to con­vert it into a bi­o­log­i­cal weapon, with ex­po­sure to an amount as small as a pin­head ca­pa­ble of caus­ing death within 36 to 72 hours. No known an­ti­dote ex­ists.</p>
    <p>The envelope was intercepte­d at a US gov­ern­ment mail cen­tre be­fore it could be de­liv­ered to the White House.</p>
    <p>The Se­cret Ser­vice and the RCMP both de­clined com­ment on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>There have been nu­mer­ous in­ci­dents i nvolv­ing en­velopes with ricin sent to US of­fi­cials in re­cent years. In 2018, a Utah man was in­dicted on charges of mak­ing ricin­re­lated threats to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, FBI di­rec­tor Christophe­r Wray and other fed­eral of­fi­cials, with all the let­ters “con­tain­ing cas­tor bean ma­te­rial”.</p>
    <p>Two peo­ple have been con­victed and sen­tenced to prison in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents of send­ing ricin-tainted let­ters to Mr Barack Obama while he was pres­i­dent.</p>
