    <p>What are the traits of a psy­chopath and why has this be­come a sub­ject of ur­gent con­cern among Amer­i­can men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als?</p>
    <p>In ca­sual con­ver­sa­tion, a “psy­chopath” has come to mean any­thing and ev­ery­thing that we find repulsive – from a mass mur­derer to an un­scrupu­lous busi­ness­man to a phi­lan­der­ing part­ner. But in re­cent years, the la­bel – along with “nar­cis­sist” – has taken a po­lit­i­cal turn in the United States, with men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als ap­ply­ing it to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>One of the most vo­cal is Dr John Gart­ner, an Amer­i­can psy­chol­o­gist and psy­chother­a­pist. In an in­ter­view with The New Yorker mag­a­zine be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion, he warned that the pe­riod be­tween Nov 3 and Jan 20 (inau­gu­ra­tion day) could pos­si­bly be “the most dan­ger­ous mo­ment” of Mr Trump’s pres­i­dency should he lose.</p>
    <p>An in­di­vid­ual with a dan­ger­ous mix of psy­chopa­thy and nar­cis­sism, he ex­plained, would re­act venge­fully when wounded.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Dr Gart­ner founded</p>
    <p>Duty To Warn, an as­so­ci­a­tion of largely men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als who had per­sis­tently pressed Congress to use the 25th Amend­ment to deem the</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent “un­able to dis­charge the pow­ers and du­ties of his of­fice” on the grounds of his ques­tion­able men­tal state and per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Its mem­bers in­clude psy­chi­a­trists who felt com­pelled to speak up de­spite the Gold­wa­ter Rule, a code of con­duct of the Amer­i­can Psy­chi­atric As­so­ci­a­tion that for­bids psy­chi­a­trists from ex­press­ing their pro­fes­sional opin­ions about pub­lic fig­ures they have not per­son­ally ex­am­ined.</p>
    <p>The rule is a legacy of the 1964 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, where more than a thou­sand psy­chi­a­trists signed a pe­ti­tion declar­ing the Re­pub­li­can can­di­date, Sen­a­tor Barry Gold­wa­ter, “se­verely para­noid” and “un­fit” to be pres­i­dent. The sen­a­tor lost the elec­tion but won a li­bel suit against the mag­a­zine that pub­lished the views of these psy­chi­a­trists. The re­sult­ing bad pub­lic­ity dented the rep­u­ta­tion of Amer­i­can psy­chi­a­try and the rule came into be­ing. Step­ping aside from the de­bate on whether Amer­ica’s 45th pres­i­dent is a psy­chopath, let us con­sider who psy­chopaths are and where they are to be found.</p>
    <p>Psy­chopaths come from all walks of life: crim­i­nals, of course, but also en­ter­tain­ers, busi­ness­men and, yes, even from my med­i­cal pro­fes­sion. Ex­clud­ing Han­ni­bal Lecter – the fic­tional psy­chi­a­trist and can­ni­bal­is­tic se­rial killer – there was Harold Ship­man, a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner in Eng­land who was charged in 2000 with the mur­der of 15 pa­tients by lethal in­jec­tions of di­amor­phine. Later in­ves­ti­ga­tions put his ac­tual mur­der toll at around 250 pa­tients over his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to Dr Robert Hare, a Cana­dian psy­chol­o­gist who de­vel­oped the Psy­chopa­thy Check­list – the gold stan­dard test for di­ag­nos­ing psy­chopa­thy – it is the lime­light of po­lit­i­cal life that psy­chopaths, with their over­ween­ing urges for power and adu­la­tion, find par­tic­u­larly en­tic­ing.</p>
    <p>ORI­GINS OF THE TERM</p>
    <p>The term “psy­chopath” (coined in the 1800s from its Greek roots psykhe and pathos, mean­ing “sick mind”) was in­tro­duced into pop­u­lar cul­ture by a 1941 book called The Mask Of</p>
    <p>San­ity, writ­ten by Dr</p>
    <p>Her­vey Cleck­ley, a pro­fes­sor of psy­chi­a­try at the</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal College of</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing from the case his­to­ries of his pa­tients, Dr Cleck­ley iso­lated 16 traits char­ac­ter­is­ing a psy­chopath.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to him, these in­clude be­ing un­re­li­able, dis­hon­est, ir­re­spon­si­ble, ego­cen­tric, emo­tion­ally shal­low, and lack­ing in em­pa­thy and in­sight. While these traits would make the per­son re­pel­lent to others and per­haps ren­der him (it is usu­ally a male) less dan­ger­ous, they are of­ten hid­den be­neath a ve­neer of charm and charisma.</p>
    <p>Dr Cleck­ley mar­velled at the Machi­avel­lian pro­cliv­ity that his psy­chopaths have in ma­nip­u­lat­ing peo­ple, and the ease with which they lied, cheated and played upon their friends and fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The ma­lign sin­gu­lar­ity of such in­di­vid­u­als in so­ci­ety has long been recog­nised. In the early 19th cen­tury, Dr Ben­jamin Rush (of­ten called the “fa­ther of Amer­i­can psy­chi­a­try”, and one of the sign­ers of the Dec­la­ra­tion of In­de­pen­dence) wrote about a form of moral de­range­ment or in­san­ity found in a per­son who was ob­vi­ously not psy­chotic but would en­gage in pro­foundly an­ti­so­cial be­hav­iour in­clud­ing acts of vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>The Vic­to­rian psy­chi­a­trist</p>
    <p>Henry Maud­s­ley stated that such a morally in­sane in­di­vid­ual has “no ca­pac­ity for true moral feel­ings; all his im­pulses and de­sires, to which he yields without check, are ego­is­tic; his con­duct seems to be gov­erned by im­moral mo­tives”.</p>
    <p>Dr Maud­s­ley was amazed, like Dr Cleck­ley half a cen­tury later, by their “ex­tra­or­di­nary in­ge­nu­ity in ex­plain­ing, ex­cus­ing or jus­ti­fy­ing their be­hav­iour, ex­ag­ger­at­ing this, ig­nor­ing that, and so colour­ing the whole as to make them­selves ap­pear the vic­tim of mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>Psy­chi­a­trists in those days could not agree on whether this “moral in­san­ity” was ac­tu­ally just plain de­prav­ity or whether it was truly an ill­ness, but they did agree that the sin­gu­lar fea­ture of these in­di­vid­u­als is the con­spic­u­ous ab­sence of con­science.</p>
    <p>AB­SENCE OF CON­SCIENCE</p>
    <p>Con­science is that in­trin­sic hu­man ca­pac­ity to judge what is morally right and wrong. We dread in­cur­ring those feel­ings of guilt, shame and re­morse when we do some­thing wrong and this makes us act morally.</p>
    <p>The philoso­pher James Chil­dress has said that con­science is “in part, avoid­ance of a sanc­tion im­posed by the self on it­self”.</p>
    <p>But in psy­chopaths, the con­nec­tion be­tween a moral sense of what is right and wrong and feel­ings of re­morse is ei­ther not there or is bro­ken, so there is no con­science as we un­der­stand it. Hence, there is no in­ter­nal check on their bad im­pulses and ac­tions.</p>
    <p>There is a school of thought called neu­rophi­los­o­phy (or phi­los­o­phy of neuroscien­ce) that views our con­science not as “a the­o­log­i­cal en­tity thought­fully parked in us by a di­vine be­ing”, but rather as a brain con­struct aris­ing from the con­fig­u­ra­tion of our neu­ral cir­cuitries that has been shaped by evo­lu­tion­ary forces over mil­len­nia to en­able hu­mans to live so­cially to­gether and thrive.</p>
    <p>And when that is miss­ing, the ex­pla­na­tion must be some sort of neu­ro­log­i­cal im­pair­ment as, say, con­gen­i­tal anal­ge­sia, a rare ge­netic con­di­tion in which a per­son can­not feel phys­i­cal pain.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing weight to this hy­poth­e­sis are sci­en­tific stud­ies that have iden­ti­fied cer­tain pu­ta­tive genes associated with psy­chopa­thy, while brain imag­ing has shown some ab­nor­mal­i­ties in the brains of psy­chopaths.</p>
    <p>If in­deed psy­chopa­thy is caused by some im­mutable brain aber­ra­tions from an early on­set, that greatly di­min­ishes the odds of an ef­fec­tive treat­ment, par­tic­u­larly for adult psy­chopaths. As they are so in­dif­fer­ent to how their ac­tions af­fect others, they are un­likely to see the need to seek help in the first place.</p>
    <p>If com­pelled to do so by des­per­ate fam­ily mem­bers or by some le­gal prob­lems, they are likely to see the ther­a­pist as some­one to be ex­ploited, ma­nip­u­lated and conned.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts dis­agree over how crim­i­nal psy­chopaths should be man­aged. Many be­lieve that pri­son rather than men­tal health in­sti­tu­tions is the proper place for them, as they could en­dan­ger men­tal health work­ers and pa­tients given their propen­sity for crim­i­nal­ity.</p>
    <p>Of course, not all psy­chopaths are vi­o­lent crim­i­nals. There are the so-called “suc­cess­ful psy­chopaths” who man­age to stay within the con­fines of the law. Some, as Dr Cleck­ley had thought, would thrive and pros­per in the in­di­vid­u­al­is­tic, win­ner-takes-all as­pect of Amer­i­can cul­ture – es­pe­cially in the cor­po­rate and po­lit­i­cal are­nas.</p>
    <p>Nor are psy­chopaths all the same – par­tic­u­lar traits may pre­dom­i­nate in dif­fer­ent peo­ple, but they all ex­ert a bale­ful power over any­one un­for­tu­nate enough to be­come en­tan­gled with them.</p>
    <p>It is cru­cial that one knows how to iden­tify a psy­chopath be­fore it is too late and be on guard against the in­her­ent de­cep­tive­ness. The best thing to do is to keep as much dis­tance as pos­si­ble or to part com­pany as soon as pos­si­ble, but hell hath no fury like a psy­chopath scorned, and any at­tempt to break free can some­times pro­voke vi­cious re­tal­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Gart­ner, in that New Yorker ar­ti­cle, likened Amer­i­can vot­ers to an abused spouse who fi­nally had enough and tries to eject the abuser out of the house. Dr Gart­ner asked: “Well, what does he do then?”</p>
    <p>As a psy­chi­a­trist prac­tis­ing in Sin­ga­pore and not be­ing a mem­ber of the Amer­i­can Psy­chi­atric As­so­ci­a­tion, I’m not sub­jected to the Gold­wa­ter Rule. How­ever, a tenet of our prac­tice is that we re­frain from af­fix­ing a di­ag­nos­tic la­bel on some­one without first con­duct­ing a thor­ough as­sess­ment, and we are bound by con­fi­den­tial­ity to our pa­tients.</p>
    <p>But the de­bate in the US does raise a ques­tion for all in my pro­fes­sion – ar­guably the best equipped and qual­i­fied to make a call on any pub­lic fig­ure based on ob­ser­va­tion and pub­licly avail­able in­for­ma­tion. If con­fronted with a psy­cho­pathic and men­tally un­sta­ble leader, do we speak out?</p>
    <p>Yes, there are the pro­fes­sional tenets, but we do also have a duty to warn and a duty to pro­tect the pub­lic.</p>
