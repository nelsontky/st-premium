    <p>NEW YORK • The global eq­uity rally stalled yes­ter­day, with Euro­pean shares drop­ping and US fu­tures un­wind­ing some of this week’s surge as Amer­ica’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion count con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>Asia’s surge stut­tered as prof­ittak­ers set in ahead of the weekend.</p>
    <p>Tokyo, Syd­ney, Seoul, Welling­ton, Taipei, Jakarta, Mum­bai and Manila all rose, but Hong Kong, Shang­hai, Sin­ga­pore and Bangkok slipped.</p>
    <p>Still, Axi strate­gist Stephen Innes said the mood re­mained buoy­ant. “Eq­uity mar­kets’ im­pres­sive abil­ity to switch nar­ra­tives and stay op­ti­mistic, al­most re­gard­less of the out­come, sug­gests con­tin­ued high re­silience,” he said in a note.</p>
    <p>Wall Street’s main in­dexes were set to take a breather yes­ter­day af­ter surg­ing more than 7 per cent this week.</p>
    <p>The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones opened flat, as Demo­crat Joe Bi­den took the lead in the key swing states, putting him on the verge of win­ning the White House.</p>
    <p>The Nas­daq dropped 0.18 per cent at the open­ing bell.</p>
    <p>Trea­suries were lit­tle changed af­ter Fed­eral Re­serve of­fi­cials kept in­ter­est rates near zero on Thurs­day, and made no change to as­set pur­chases while stress­ing that the US econ­omy needs more fis­cal and mon­e­tary pol­icy sup­port.</p>
    <p>Tech stocks led the de­cline in the Stoxx Europe 600 In­dex, with IT ser­vices firm Net­com­pany Group slump­ing more than 8 per cent af­ter a down­beat earn­ings re­port.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket re­ac­tion to the un­fold­ing elec­tion news sug­gests that fi­nan­cial mar­kets would pre­fer to see a con­strained Bi­den pres­i­dency,” said Janus Hen­der­son In­vestors’ multi-as­set head Paul O’Connor.</p>
    <p>“The eco­nomic back­drop to this elec­tion is one of an in­com­plete global re­cov­ery that re­mains threat­ened by the con­tin­ued spread of Covid-19 in many ma­jor economies as well as fast-fad­ing fis­cal sup­port mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>MSCI’s all-coun­try in­dex of the world’s 49 mar­kets was flat af­ter gains ear­lier in the week, close to the record reached in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Else­where, crude oil de­clined and gold was lit­tle changed. The US dol­lar held steady near a two-year low.</p>
    <p>In­vestors also fo­cused on the prospects of stalled talks on a US coro­n­avirus re­lief pack­age restart­ing. “We still an­tic­i­pate that there will be a fis­cal pack­age in ex­cess of US$1 tril­lion (S$1.35 tril­lion) next year,” said Mr James Knight­ley, chief in­ter­na­tional economist at ING Group in New York.</p>
    <p>“This stim­u­lus, when com­bined with a long-an­tic­i­pated Covid-19 vac­cine, can re­ally lift the econ­omy and drive growth.”</p>
    <p>The elec­tion has done lit­tle to al­ter the broadly pos­i­tive in­vest­ment back­drop, noted Mr Di­dier Sain­tGe­orges, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and a mem­ber of the strate­gic in­vest­ment com­mit­tee at as­set man­ager Carmignac in Paris.</p>
    <p>“Mov­ing from Trump to Bi­den looks like a revo­lu­tion, but in mar­ket terms, it may not be that sig­nif­i­cant.”</p>
