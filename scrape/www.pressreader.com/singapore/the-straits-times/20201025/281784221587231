    <p>For­mer Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) col­lege don Jeremy Fer­nando has apol­o­gised for the dis­tress re­lated to al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct made against him.</p>
    <p>He also said he filed a po­lice re­port on a re­lated as­pect of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, he broke his si­lence on the mat­ter, say­ing: “I would like to apol­o­gise for the dis­tress th­ese events have caused to those caught up in this sit­u­a­tion, and those clos­est to me.”</p>
    <p>Dr Fer­nando, a for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege fel­low, was sacked on Oct 7 fol­low­ing al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct made against him by two stu­dents.</p>
    <p>NUS said on Wed­nes­day that it had made a po­lice re­port “given the se­ri­ous­ness of the al­le­ga­tions”.</p>
    <p>Both stu­dents had al­leged that Dr Fer­nando made non-con­sen­sual ad­vances to­wards them.</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s state­ment to news pub­li­ca­tion To­day, Dr Fer­nando said: “I have also made my own re­port to the po­lice on a re­lated as­pect of this sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Given the on­go­ing na­ture of th­ese in­ves­ti­ga­tions and be­cause I un­der­stand I may be bound by cer­tain obli­ga­tions of con­fi­den­tial­ity, I am un­able to com­ment on th­ese other pro­ceed­ings at this mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>He said he fully ac­cepts his dis­missal from the univer­sity on the grounds of a breach of NUS’ code of con­duct.</p>
    <p>“As a con­se­quence, I was dis­missed on the grounds of an in­ti­mate as­so­ci­a­tion with an un­der­grad­u­ate,” he said, adding that he fully co­op­er­ated dur­ing in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions con­ducted by the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He noted that po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are un­der way af­ter the univer­sity made a re­port, and he is “coop</p>
    <p>CLAR­I­FI­CA­TION</p>
    <p>I would like to apol­o­gise for the dis­tress th­ese events have caused to those caught up in this sit­u­a­tion, and those clos­est to me... I have also made my own re­port to the po­lice on a re­lated as­pect of this sit­u­a­tion...</p>
    <p>I now feel that given the se­ri­ous­ness of the al­le­ga­tions made against me, it is im­por­tant that I make this state­ment to clar­ify my po­si­tion, as much as I am able to at this point.</p>
    <p>DR JEREMY FER­NANDO,</p>
    <p>er­at­ing fully”.</p>
    <p>He also said that he had re­frained from com­ment­ing on the sit­u­a­tion so far as it “has been a pe­riod of re­flec­tion” for him and also as in­ves­ti­ga­tions are un­der way.</p>
    <p>“I now feel that given the se­ri­ousin his state­ment yes­ter­day. ness of the al­le­ga­tions made against me, it is im­por­tant that I make this state­ment to clar­ify my po­si­tion, as much as I am able to at this point,” he added.</p>
