    <p>The cost of rapid Covid-19 test­ing has dropped from $80 per per­son – when such test kits were first de­ployed – to un­der $50 now, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The costs of the anti­gen rapid test­ing, which in­clude oper­a­tion and man­power costs, are likely to come down fur­ther, he added.</p>
    <p>“Over time, we can ex­pect more in­no­va­tive rapid test kits that are cheaper, faster and more con­ve­nient to ad­min­is­ter,” Mr Wong told Par­lia­ment in a min­is­te­rial state­ment on Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“These will en­able us to test more ex­ten­sively and con­ve­niently, to de­tect pos­i­tive cases and pro­tect our pop­u­la­tion more com­pre­hen­sively.”</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid test­ing has been used as a pre-event safety mea­sure for large-scale ac­tiv­i­ties. It com­ple­ments the more sen­si­tive, but slower poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong noted how con­cerns had emerged among var­i­ous groups when Sin­ga­pore first de­ployed test­ing in a sig­nif­i­cant way.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple thought it would be a has­sle, he said, while oth­ers felt there would be a stigma as­so­ci­ated with be­ing iden­ti­fied for test­ing.</p>
    <p>“But I hope by now we can all ap­pre­ci­ate and un­der­stand the rea­sons why test­ing is im­por­tant and nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter stressed that fre­quent and wide­spread test­ing is an im­por­tant en­abler for Sin­ga­pore to de­tect coro­n­avirus cases early, adding that test­ing will be ramped up in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans must start get­ting used to the idea of reg­u­lar test­ing be­ing a part of their lives dur­ing the pan­demic, he said.</p>
    <p>At present, any­one who sees a doc­tor with an acute re­s­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion or flu-like symp­toms will be ad­vised to take a PCR test, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age, last month, more than 14,000 in­di­vid­u­als were tested ev­ery week. This was how sev­eral re­cent cases were picked up, he added.</p>
    <p>“It is very im­por­tant for any­one who feels un­well to see the doc­tor im­me­di­ately,” Mr Wong said. “And if the doc­tor ad­vises you to be tested, please com­ply with the doc­tor’s in­struc­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force in charge of tack­ling the Covid-19 cri­sis, also un­der­scored the im­por­tance of stick­ing to safe man­age­ment mea­sures, even as Sin­ga­pore is in phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were eased on Dec 28, mean­ing that Sin­ga­pore­ans could gather in groups larger than five – but not more than eight – for the first time in months.</p>
    <p>Ca­pac­ity lim­its at at­trac­tions, malls and places of wor­ship also went up, while rules for mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tions and live per­for­mances were re­laxed.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said: “Un­for­tu­nately, there are a few who per­sist in push­ing their luck and dis­re­gard­ing the rules.</p>
    <p>“We have stepped up checks over the fes­tive pe­riod. Firm en­force­ment ac­tions have been and will con­tinue to be taken against any breaches.”</p>
    <p>He urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to keep up the good habits cul­ti­vated over the past few months, such as wear­ing masks, prac­tis­ing good hy­giene, wash­ing their hands reg­u­larly and not touch­ing their faces with their hands.</p>
    <p>Added Mr Wong: “Let’s not for­get the ba­sic mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>CHEAPER, FASTER TESTS</p>
    <p>Over time, we can ex­pect more in­no­va­tive rapid test kits that are cheaper, faster and more con­ve­nient to ad­min­is­ter... These will en­able us to test more ex­ten­sively and con­ve­niently, to de­tect pos­i­tive cases and pro­tect our pop­u­la­tion more com­pre­hen­sively.</p>
