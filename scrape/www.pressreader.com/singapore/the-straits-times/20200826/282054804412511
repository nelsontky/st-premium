    <p>The mar­itime sec­tor has re­mained re­silient amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, with con­tainer through­put fall­ing by only 2 per cent from Jan­uary to July this year com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>This is lower than has been regis­tered at many other ports, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Chee Hong Tat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We have kept our port open and goods flow­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In fact, we saw some di­ver­sion of traf­fic from other ports to the port of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>In or­der to build on this, the Gov­ern­ment will look to ex­pand the base of mar­itime talent in Sin­ga­pore, said Mr Chee at an on­line di­a­logue to pro­mote job op­por­tu­ni­ties in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>He an­nounced one such ini­tia­tive yes­ter­day to of­fer more than 200 trainee­ships in the mar­itime sec­tor to new and re­cent grad­u­ates. They will come un­der the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme, which aims to give grad­u­ates and soon-to-be grad­u­ates in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence in var­i­ous sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions that will be of­fer­ing the trainee­ships in­clude PSA, Jurong Port and Maersk Sin­ga­pore. Those in­ter­ested can ap­ply for roles in ar­eas such as oper­a­tions, en­gi­neer­ing and cor­po­rate job func­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said: “This is a good start, but we are not go­ing to stop here.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to work with the in­dus­try to create more train­ing and at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties to grow our mar­itime talent pool.”</p>
    <p>He said that the sec­tor of­fers op­por­tu­ni­ties for travel and pays at­trac­tive salaries.</p>
    <p>But he ac­knowl­edged it is still un­der pres­sure with the global econ­omy slow­ing down, af­fect­ing trade vol­umes and the move­ment of goods.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while com­pa­nies have be­come more cau­tious in the cur­rent cli­mate, the Gov­ern­ment is con­fi­dent that the mar­itime sec­tor will con­tinue grow­ing af­ter the Covid-19 pan­demic ends, he said.</p>
    <p>Train­ing work­ers now will help to pro­tect Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as a global hub port and in­ter­na­tional mar­itime cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing for­ward, Sin­ga­pore will also look to com­bine the strengths of its sea port and airport to of­fer multi-modal lo­gis­tic so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said this will en­able the Repub­lic to seize op­por­tu­ni­ties cre­ated by the rapid growth of e-com­merce in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“Even though you are plac­ing the or­ders on­line, the goods still have to be de­liv­ered phys­i­cally,” said Mr Chee.</p>
    <p>“This will give an ex­tra boost to in­tra-re­gional trade, (so) con­nec­tiv­ity and lo­gis­tics will play in­creas­ingly im­por­tant roles.”</p>
    <p>RE­MAIN­ING OPEN</p>
    <p>We have kept our port open and goods flow­ing. In fact, we saw some di­ver­sion of traf­fic from other ports to the port of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
