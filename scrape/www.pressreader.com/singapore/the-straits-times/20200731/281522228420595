    <p>De­spite the muted eco­nomic out­look, some 10,000 lo­cal res­i­dents found jobs through Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) ca­reer match­ing ser­vices in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment agency said yes­ter­day that it has been ramp­ing up its ef­forts to source and cu­rate jobs by or­gan­is­ing as many vir­tual and phys­i­cal ca­reer fairs as pos­si­ble in the past few months. The jobs of­fered at the fairs in­clude contract-based and per­ma­nent ones, with part-time and full-time op­tions.</p>
    <p>The agency said there has been a steady in­crease in the num­ber of peo­ple seek­ing as­sis­tance through its ca­reer-match­ing ser­vices over the past three years.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has slipped into a tech­ni­cal re­ces­sion amid the Covid-19 pan­demic. Un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ments jumped in the three months ended June, with to­tal em­ploy­ment record­ing the big­gest quar­terly fall on record.</p>
    <p>Some 10,000 lo­cal res­i­dents found jobs through Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) ca­reer match­ing ser­vices in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of place­ments is sim­i­lar to that in the same pe­riod last year, even though the labour mar­ket has been badly hit this year by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment agency said yes­ter­day that it has been ramp­ing up its ef­forts to source and cu­rate jobs by or­gan­is­ing as many vir­tual and phys­i­cal ca­reer fairs as pos­si­ble in the past few months.</p>
    <p>It said the jobs of­fered at the fairs in­clude both contract-based and per­ma­nent ones, with part-time and full-time op­tions.</p>
    <p>WSG chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Choon Shian said: “With the pan­demic chang­ing the way we work and trans­form­ing in­dus­tries at a much ac­cel­er­ated pace, we en­cour­age our job seek­ers to keep an open mind to look be­yond what is fa­mil­iar to take on jobs in new roles or even new sec­tors, and em­brace reskilling to stay rel­e­vant and at­trac­tive to em­ploy­ers when hir­ing de­mand picks up again.”</p>
    <p>He added that the agency will be hir­ing and train­ing more ca­reer coaches and staff to sup­port job seek­ers dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The lat­est pre­lim­i­nary labour mar­ket data, re­leased on Wednes­day, showed that un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ments surged be­tween April and last month. To­tal em­ploy­ment, in­clud­ing those on work passes but ex­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, saw the big­gest quar­terly fall on record.</p>
    <p>Among the ben­e­fi­cia­ries of WSG’s work this year is Mr Alvin Lim, 48, who was re­trenched last year for the fourth time in 12 years, and was still un­em­ployed when his 77-year-old fa­ther, a kid­ney pa­tient, died in Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>“I was feel­ing very sad and down about be­ing re­trenched. I won­dered ‘why me again’. And when my fa­ther passed away it added to my emo­tional stress,” said Mr Lim, who had lost his job as a cus­tomer op­er­a­tions man­ager in a global cor­po­rate travel agency.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of two teenagers had pre­vi­ously worked as a ser­vice man­ager in the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try, and tried un­suc­cess­fully to re­join the in­dus­try at the same level.</p>
    <p>Through the help of a ca­reer coach and coun­sel­lor from WSG, he picked him­self up and landed a tem­po­rary job man­ning a govern­ment hot­line in April this year. How­ever, it was can­celled a few days be­fore he was due to start be­cause the cir­cuit breaker was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Things fi­nally turned around in May when he started work lead­ing a team of peo­ple who con­duct sur­veys for the Min­istry of Man­power. His boss has since ex­tended his contract in recog­ni­tion of his good per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>A WSG spokesman said there has been a steady in­crease in the num­ber of peo­ple seek­ing as­sis­tance through its ca­reer-match­ing ser­vices over the past three years, which have also seen the agency ex­pand­ing its foot­print in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Its phys­i­cal con­tact points in­clude l oca­tions i n Paya Le­bar, Tampines and Wood­lands, and more re­cently, SGUnited Jobs and Skills Cen­tres be­ing set up in all 24</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING AN OPEN MIND</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic chang­ing the way we work and trans­form­ing in­dus­tries at a much ac­cel­er­ated pace, we en­cour­age our job seek­ers to keep an open mind to look be­yond what is fa­mil­iar to take on jobs in new roles or even new sec­tors, and em­brace reskilling to stay rel­e­vant and at­trac­tive to em­ploy­ers when hir­ing de­mand picks up again.</p>

    <p>WORK­FORCE SIN­GA­PORE CHIEF EX­EC­U­TIVE TAN CHOON SHIAN</p>
    <p>Hous­ing Board towns.</p>
    <p>On­line, the MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg por­tal was launched in April 2018.</p>
    <p>Work­force Sin­ga­pore prin­ci­pal ca­reer coach Belinda Boo said it is nat­u­ral for peo­ple to feel dis­cour­aged if they lose a job or are un­able to find a suit­able one. But it is also im­por­tant for them not to lose hope as there are still op­por­tu­ni­ties, she said.</p>
    <p>If re­trenched, she rec­om­mends that job seek­ers see how their skill sets can help them stand out and be open to op­por­tu­ni­ties in other sec­tors or job types.</p>
    <p>There are op­por­tu­ni­ties even dur­ing Covid-19, in ar­eas such as e-com­merce and health ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers can also seek pro­fes­sional ca­reer guid­ance, said Ms Boo.</p>
    <p>WSG’s Ca­reers Con­nect cen­tres’ ca­reer coaches, for in­stance, can pro­vide one-on-one guid­ance and give ad­vice on writ­ing a re­sume and pre­par­ing for in­ter­views. They can also lend a lis­ten­ing ear.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, though, the onus is on job seek­ers to fol­low through on their ca­reer ac­tion plan, she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, too, said his ad­vice to other job seek­ers is to not be afraid to grab an op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mean that contract roles don’t help at all. It may be a three-month job but it could lead to some­thing else, you have to take that first step,” he said.</p>
