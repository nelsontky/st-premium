    <p>De­spite the progress made in the past 20 years for per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties, more needs to be done to plug gaps in ar­eas like health­care and jobs, said Ms Denise Phua (Jalan Be­sar GRC).</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, Ms Phua said Sin­ga­pore has made ma­jor strides over the years in ad­dress­ing the needs of peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties (PWD).</p>
    <p>For in­stance, gov­ern­ment fund­ing for early in­ter­ven­tion cen­tres and spe­cial schools has in­creased sub­stan­tially, and there are schemes to give in­cen­tives to em­ploy­ers to hire dis­abled peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In 2013, the Gov­ern­ment also set up SG En­able, an agency for the dis­abil­ity com­mu­nity, she added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is still not enough com­mu­nity aware­ness and sup­port for per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties, and they still face so­cial stigma, said Ms Phua.</p>
    <p>Care­givers con­tinue to worry about what will hap­pen to their chil­dren or fam­ily mem­bers with dis­abil­i­ties af­ter they die, she said.</p>
    <p>There is also a lack of a ro­bust care­giver sup­port model that is more em­pow­er­ing, fam­ily-based and com­mu­nity-based, she added.</p>
    <p>Op­tions for PWD af­ter they grad­u­ate from spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion (Sped) schools are lim­ited, she said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing an ad­journ­ment mo­tion – which al­lows an MP to speak on a sub­ject for 20 min­utes at the end of the sit­ting – Ms Phua said there are about 250,000 PWD in Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to 2018 sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>If each dis­abled per­son has an av­er­age of three im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers, there are more than one mil­lion peo­ple di­rectly im­pacted by dis­abil­ity here, she added.</p>
    <p>As for ed­u­ca­tion, Ms Phua said the “cliff-ef­fect phe­nom­e­non” for Sped stu­dents is well known. It refers to how ser­vices for Sped stu­dents drop to lit­tle or noth­ing af­ter they com­plete for­mal school­ing, when they are about 18.</p>
    <p>And most Skill­sFu­ture of­fer­ings are not ac­ces­si­ble to adults with dis­abil­i­ties as there is no dis­abil­ity learn­ing sup­port, she added.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing to jobs, Ms Phua said PWD have lim­ited op­tions for work, and there are not enough em­ploy­ers with the con­fi­dence to em­ploy and de­velop them. To ad­dress such is­sues, there are five key ar­eas where more needs to be done for per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties, she said.</p>
    <p>First, the way so­ci­ety sees a per­son with dis­abil­i­ties must change – not as a pa­tient with an ill­ness to be cured or some­one who needs char­ity or pity and is a vic­tim of life.</p>
    <p>In­stead, dis­abil­i­ties need to be seen as a re­sult of at­ti­tu­di­nal, en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial bar­ri­ers – and re­mov­ing these bar­ri­ers will al­low a dis­abled per­son to par­tic­i­pate fully in com­mu­nity life.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, gaps in pro­vi­sions for those with dis­abil­i­ties have to be ad­dressed. Ms Phua sug­gested, among other things, de­vel­op­ing a play­book to help them plan for life af­ter a care­giver’s death so that their qual­ity of life is not af­fected.</p>
    <p>Third, there needs to be a com­mit­ment to public re­port­ing of per­for­mance and progress of these ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Fourth, Ms Phua said there needs to be more struc­ture in pol­i­cy­mak­ing and im­ple­ment­ing ser­vices for PWD, so “re­sources can be al­lo­cated from a ‘life-cy­cle’ per­spec­tive, know­ing that each move made will im­pact the rest of the whole ecosys­tem”.</p>
    <p>Lastly, PWD must be in­cluded in pol­i­cy­mak­ing and im­ple­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>GOVT STEP­PING UP EF­FORTS</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment and Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing said ef­forts to ad­dress the is­sues faced by PWD are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>These in­clude strength­en­ing sup­port in the tran­si­tion to postschool­ing life and em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>There are now tran­si­tion plan­ning co­or­di­na­tors in all Sped schools, and the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry will soon pro­vide an in­di­vid­ual plan­ning guide to help de­velop per­son-cen­tred plans for each stu­dent’s school jour­ney and tran­si­tion to adult life, said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore has also been work­ing with train­ing providers to of­fer cour­ses for dis­abled peo­ple, and will be ex­pand­ing the range of in­dus­try-rel­e­vant cour­ses, she added.</p>
    <p>For the in­sur­ance sec­tor, the So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Min­istry and Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore are look­ing to is­sue guide­lines for in­sur­ers to treat PWD like ev­ery­one else, un­less such dif­fer­ences can be jus­ti­fied, said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing schemes such as the wage off­set En­abling Em­ploy­ment Credit and Open Door Pro­gramme that pro­vides job place­ment sup­port are meant to en­cour­age more em­ploy­ers to hire PWD, she added.</p>
    <p>“Much has been done to im­prove sup­port for PWD and care­givers, but def­i­nitely more can be done,” said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>“As Ms Phua has noted, PWD in the post-school­ing years need more learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, cus­tomised ser­vices and sup­port­ive work en­vi­ron­ments closer to their homes. We will work with part­ners to co-cre­ate and pilot so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sun added that PWD and care­givers will be in­vited to par­tic­i­pate in en­gage­ment ses­sions as part of the Emerg­ing Stronger con­ver­sa­tions, to talk about the chal­lenges and op­por­tu­ni­ties aris­ing from Covid-19.</p>
