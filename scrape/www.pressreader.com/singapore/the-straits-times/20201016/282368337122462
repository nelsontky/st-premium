    <p>In Ms Cindy Wong’s home­made gra­nola, you will not find re­fined sugar, vague “spe­cial mix­tures” or other in­gre­di­ents the ev­ery­day con­sumer might not recog­nise.</p>
    <p>Trans­parency is key, says the 31-year-old baker be­hind home­based gra­nola busi­ness Cindy’s Pantry (@cindys.pantry on In­sta­gram).</p>
    <p>“If it’s prawn sea­son­ing, just say so. Even for prod­ucts that claim to be or­ganic, if you flip to the back, there are so many in­gre­di­ents you don’t know. I be­lieve you should know what you are putting into your body and will­ingly want to eat it,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Her mes­sage of con­scious eat­ing was in­spired by a per­sonal jour­ney.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2018, Ms Wong was di­ag­nosed with Stage 1a breast cancer. Her part­ner had found the lump, after try­ing to wake her in the morn­ing with a play­ful pinch on her breast. She had felt noth­ing, but agreed to see a doc­tor.</p>
    <p>A few months after her di­ag­no­sis, she was found to be BRCA1 pos­i­tive – the same ge­netic mu­ta­tion Amer­i­can ac­tress An­gelina Jolie was found to have in 2013. Women with the BRCA1 gene mu­ta­tion have a sig­nif­i­cantly higher risk of de­vel­op­ing breast or ovar­ian cancer.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing led a healthy life­style and hav­ing no fam­ily his­tory of cancer, Ms Wong was stunned. “I was one of those peo­ple who know about breast cancer, but don’t check them­selves. Ap­par­ently, my dad has the BRCA1 gene and passed it to me.”</p>
    <p>As a pre­ven­tive mea­sure, she did a dou­ble mas­tec­tomy and en­dured 12 cy­cles of chemo­ther­apy from Novem­ber 2018 to Fe­bru­ary last year. Three months ago, she un­der­went a full hys­terec­tomy – a pro­ce­dure to re­move her ovaries, uterus, cervix and fal­lop­ian tubes.</p>
    <p>The surgery means she can never have chil­dren. But her gy­nae­col­o­gist had ad­vised her that the risk of cancer cells re­turn­ing and spread­ing to her ovaries was “not a mat­ter of if, but when”, she re­calls. “He said the timer had al­ready started.”</p>
    <p>She feels cancer has changed many of her eat­ing habits for the bet­ter. She used to eat fast food ev­ery day in pri­mary and sec­ondary school, and pro­cessed meats, she says with a shud­der.</p>
    <p>Now a pescatar­ian, she be­lieves her diet in the past “def­i­nitely” had some­thing to do with her cancer.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore cancer, I wasn’t re­ally both­ered by food I got out­side. After, I be­came very strict with what I was eat­ing. I de­cided to take bet­ter care of my­self and start mak­ing what I could at home.”</p>
    <p>A gra­nola fan, she has been mak­ing her own gra­nola for five years, but started her busi­ness only in Au­gust after the pan­demic left her with more time on her hands. Covid-19 had put her train­ing to be an early child­hood teacher on hold.</p>
    <p>Her friends urged her to sell the gra­nola she whipped up for them. In the first few weeks of launch, she sold 16 to 25 pack­ets a week.</p>
    <p>Store-bought gra­nola is un­health­ier than you think, she warns. “The crispier it is, the more sugar it has.”</p>
    <p>She tries to keep her recipes as sim­ple as pos­si­ble, us­ing only nat­u­ral sugar and elim­i­nat­ing salt when not needed. The menu of­fers five flavours (320g for $18, 500g for $25), in­clud­ing masala, pump­kin puree and a “su­per dark choco­late” that uses di­a­betic-friendly sugar.</p>
    <p>She gets her in­gre­di­ents from places such as bak­ing in­gre­di­ents sup­plier Phoon Huat and on­line su­per­mar­ket RedMart, us­ing only brands she trusts and “would dare to eat my­self”. It is al­most like a be­spoke prod­uct, says Ms Wong, who makes ev­ery or­der fresh and tweaks recipes ac­cord­ing to di­etary re­quests. That in­cludes mak­ing it less sweet, spicier or saltier.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness is a good op­por­tu­nity to raise aware­ness of breast cancer in young women, she says. She is do­nat­ing 20 per cent of prof­its to the Breast Cancer Foun­da­tion (BCF) this month.</p>
    <p>There is still a stigma and “cul­tural ig­no­rance” in Sin­ga­pore at­tached to get­ting cancer at a young age, she says. “When I got di­ag­nosed, the first thing my mum told me was not to tell my ex­tended fam­ily and to try to just ‘siam’ (Singlish for lie low),” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>“To many, hav­ing cancer is seen as a weak­ness, espe­cially to those from our par­ents’ era. There’s this ig­no­rance that you get cancer be­cause you’ve done some­thing bad.”</p>
    <p>After her treat­ment, she signed up to vol­un­teer with BCF’s Aware­ness Talks – held for cor­po­rates and the com­mu­nity – where she shares her per­spec­tive as a sur­vivor. “I want to raise aware­ness that it has noth­ing to do with karma or fault, and it’s noth­ing to be ashamed of.”</p>
    <p>She hopes to im­part a sim­ple mes­sage to her cus­tomers: “Treat your body like it’s the only home you’re ever go­ing to live in – take care of your body and it will take care of you.”</p>
