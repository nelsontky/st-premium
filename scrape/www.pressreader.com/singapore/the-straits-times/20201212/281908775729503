    <p>WILM­ING­TON (Delaware) • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has tapped Ms Su­san Rice, a for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser with sig­nif­i­cant for­eign pol­icy ex­per­tise, for a do­mes­tic pol­icy brief, putting an em­pha­sis on man­age­rial ex­pe­ri­ence in his new ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>A flurry of se­nior ap­point­ments un­der­scored the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent’s com­mit­ment to a di­verse ad­min­is­tra­tion while re­ward­ing long­time loy­al­ists and vet­er­ans like him­self who served dur­ing for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s eight years in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s se­lec­tion of Ms Rice, 56, as his top do­mes­tic pol­icy ad­viser and di­rec­tor of his Do­mes­tic Pol­icy Coun­cil on Thurs­day came as a sur­prise given her ex­ten­sive back­ground in for­eign affairs.</p>
    <p>Be­sides her role as Mr Obama’s na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser, she ear­lier served as his am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions. A black woman, she had been a con­tender to be Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate.</p>
    <p>A source fa­mil­iar with Mr Bi­den’s think­ing said the Pres­i­dent-elect does not view for­eign pol­icy and do­mes­tic pol­icy as sep­a­rate realms, and be­lieves ex­pe­ri­ence in one is rel­e­vant to the other.</p>
    <p>Due to take of­fice on Jan 20, Mr Bi­den felt Ms Rice’s ex­pe­ri­ence op­er­at­ing across fed­eral gov­ern­ment agencies would en­able her to im­ple­ment his pol­icy agenda, in­clud­ing plans to re­build an econ­omy hit by the coro­n­avirus, the source said.</p>
    <p>Ms Rice was un­der con­sid­er­a­tion for Mr Bi­den’s sec­re­tary of state, but would likely have faced fierce op­po­si­tion from Repub­li­cans in Congress for her role in a con­tro­versy over the deadly 2012 at­tack on the US mis­sion in Beng­hazi, Libya.</p>
    <p>The do­mes­tic pol­icy post does not re­quire US Se­nate con­fir­ma­tion. Mr Bi­den ul­ti­mately chose long­time ad­viser Antony Blinken to head the State De­part­ment.</p>
    <p>For other po­si­tions, Mr Bi­den se­lected for­mer Iowa gov­er­nor Tom Vil­sack to serve a sec­ond ten­ure as agri­cul­ture sec­re­tary, Obama White House aide De­nis McDonough as sec­re­tary of vet­eran affairs, US Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Mar­cia Fudge to head the De­part­ment of Hous­ing and Ur­ban Devel­op­ment (HUD), and Ms Kather­ine Tai as US trade rep­re­sen­ta­tive, his tran­si­tion team said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Tran­si­tion spokesman Sean Savett said the picks were “for­ward-think­ing, cri­sis-tested and ex­pe­ri­enced” in­di­vid­u­als “ready to quickly use the levers of gov­ern­ment to make mean­ing­ful dif­fer­ences in the lives of Amer­i­cans and help gov­ern on day one”.</p>
    <p>Mr McDonough, 51, was a long­time na­tional se­cu­rity aide to Mr Obama prior to his stint as chief of staff dur­ing Mr Obama’s sec­ond term, where he worked closely with Mr Bi­den. But he has never served in the armed forces, and his se­lec­tion caught some ad­vo­cates for vet­er­ans off guard.</p>
    <p>Mr Vil­sack, 69, served as US De­part­ment of Agri­cul­ture sec­re­tary un­der Mr Obama for eight years and as Iowa gov­er­nor from 1999 to 2007. He is seen by estab­lish­ment Democrats as a sound choice, largely be­cause of his mod­er­ate pol­i­tics and relationsh­ips with largescale farm­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Fudge, 68, is a con­gress­woman from Cleve­land who has served in the US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives since 2008. If con­firmed, she would be the sec­ond black woman to lead HUD, which fo­cuses on fed­eral pol­icy sur­round­ing hous­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Tai, 45, a Chi­nese Amer­i­can who is the chief trade lawyer on the House Ways and Means Com­mit­tee, played a key role in ne­go­ti­at­ing stronger labour pro­vi­sions with the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in the new US-Mexico-Canada trade deal. She would be the first woman of colour to serve as</p>
    <p>trade rep­re­sen­ta­tive.</p>
