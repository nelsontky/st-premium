    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan may not at­tend a lead­ers’ meet­ing with South Korea and China later this year un­less “proper mea­sures” are taken in a dis­pute be­tween Seoul and Tokyo over com­pen­sa­tion for wartime forced labour, Ja­panese me­dia said yesterday.</p>
    <p>Ties be­tween the two Asian neigh­bours soured af­ter South Korea’s</p>
    <p>Supreme Court or­dered a Ja­panese steel­maker to pay com­pen­sa­tion for forced labour in 2018, prompt­ing Tokyo to im­pose ex­port curbs on some key high-tech ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>South Korea was set to host the tri­lat­eral sum­mit, held roughly once a year, but Kyodo news agency quoted diplo­matic sources as say­ing it would be “im­pos­si­ble” for new Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga to visit un­less Ja­pan’s con­cerns over the is­sue are ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>It said this view had been con­veyed to South Korea. Ja­pan’s For­eign Min­istry was not im­me­di­ately able to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The South Korean Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that Nip­pon Steel Corp should pay com­pen­sa­tion to each of four South Kore­ans for forced labour dur­ing World War II, and a lower court last year ap­proved the seizure of part of the do­mes­tic as­sets of the com­pany. Nip­pon Steel filed an ap­peal against the rul­ing in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan ar­gues that the rul­ing vi­o­lates in­ter­na­tional law be­cause all claims for com­pen­sa­tion ris­ing from Ja­pan’s 1910-1945 coloni­sa­tion of the Korean penin­sula were set­tled un­der a 1965 treaty.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga called for both coun­tries to re­pair their ties in his first con­ver­sa­tion with South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in. But he said later Ja­pan would “con­tinue to firmly seek ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion from South Korea”, with­out elab­o­rat­ing.</p>
