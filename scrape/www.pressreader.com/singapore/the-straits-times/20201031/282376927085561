    <p>For the first time in months, nine mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in a tem­po­rary dor­mi­tory in Bukit Ba­tok had the chance to head to a nearby park and meet and min­gle with lo­cal res­i­dents in the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>As part of a pi­lot ini­tia­tive by Wel­come In My Back­yard (Wimby), the mixed group of about 25 peo­ple yes­ter­day took part in a num­ber of ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing a dance work­out, games and a joint trek through Bukit Ba­tok Na­ture Park.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of Team Nila, a group of sports vol­un­teers, were also in­volved in the day’s ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Wimby is a vol­un­teer-run cam­paign that aims to en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to be more wel­com­ing to­wards mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Those who par­tic­i­pated yes­ter­day were ei­ther re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients or had tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in the past 14 days.</p>
    <p>All live in a tem­po­rary dor­mi­tory at the for­mer Bukit Ba­tok Pri­mary School in Jalan Jurong Kechil.</p>
    <p>It is one of at least 30 un­used state prop­er­ties that were con­verted to tem­po­rary ac­com­mo­da­tion for mi­grant work­ers as part of ef­forts to re­duce the den­sity in dor­mi­to­ries and to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese sites are no longer in use as work­ers have re­turned to ex­ist­ing dor­mi­to­ries or been moved to new Quick Build Dor­mi­to­ries with im­proved liv­ing standards.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), the Na­tional Parks Board and the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity gave ap­proval for the ac­tiv­i­ties to take place at the park.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, mi­grant work­ers are still largely re­stricted to their work­places and dor­mi­to­ries, or ap­proved lo­ca­tions such as recre­ation cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Th­ese mea­sures are part of ef­forts to con­trol the spread of Covid-19 among the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Wimby co-leader Ni­cholas Oh, 24, who re­cently grad­u­ated from Univer­sity Col­lege London, said the cam­paign hopes to work with rel­e­vant agen­cies and other non­govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions to ex­plore how more recre­ational op­tions can be pro­vided to mi­grant work­ers, not­ing that months of move­ment re­stric­tions have had a neg­a­tive im­pact on the men­tal health of some of them.</p>
    <p>At a sep­a­rate event in Kranji yes­ter­day, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng said the MOM is con­duct­ing “very tight and strin­gent” sce­nario plan­ning on how move­ment re­stric­tions for mi­grant work­ers can be eased, and is in the midst of is­su­ing con­tact-trac­ing de­vices to those in dorms.</p>
    <p>The first step is to en­sure that recre­ational cen­tres can cater to a ma­jor­ity of work­ers’ needs, he told re­porters, adding that up to 50 per cent of mi­grant work­ers here are now al­lowed to visit th­ese cen­tres to buy ne­ces­si­ties or to re­mit funds.</p>
    <p>“Suc­ces­sively, we’ll then see how we can open up,” said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>Mr Oh also said Wimby aims to fa­cil­i­tate in­ter­ac­tion and pos­i­tive re­la­tion­ship-build­ing be­tween lo­cal res­i­dents and mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>While yes­ter­day’s event was a pi­lot ini­tia­tive, Wimby hopes to ex­pand its outreach to com­mu­ni­ties in other hous­ing es­tates where mi­grant work­ers have been re­lo­cated.</p>
    <p>The even­tual hope is to en­gage lo­cal res­i­dents as vol­un­teers through th­ese outreach ef­forts and for them to or­gan­ise reg­u­lar com­mu­nity events in their neigh­bour­hoods, added Mr Oh.</p>
    <p>Bukit Ba­tok res­i­dent John Tan, 35, said he ap­pre­ci­ated the op­por­tu­nity to chat with and play games with Mr Ubaram Ramesh, 35, an In­dian na­tional who works in the con­struc­tion and process sec­tors in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I got to learn more about his ex­pe­ri­ence dur­ing Covid-19,” said Mr Tan, who is keen to join or or­gan­ise sim­i­lar events in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“I am re­lieved and very happy,” said Mr Ramesh of the chance to be out­doors again af­ter al­most seven months of not be­ing able to go out­side for non-work pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Mr Si­mon Te­varaj, 30, an­other In­dian na­tional, who in­stalls fi­bre op­tic ca­bles, also said he was happy to be out.</p>
    <p>He hopes that the move­ment re­stric­tions can even­tu­ally be re­laxed so that he can see his brother and un­cle, both of whom are also work­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
