    <p>CHICAGO • Nearly half a mil­lion peo­ple have con­tracted Covid-19 in the United States over the past seven days, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally, as new cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions set records in the Mid­west.</p>
    <p>Coro­n­avirus hot spots in­clude Illi­nois, which re­ported 31,000 new in­fec­tions over the past week, and two states ex­pected to be key in the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3: Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>“We must take sig­nif­i­cant and col­lec­tive ac­tions,” Dr Andrea Palm of the Wis­con­sin Depart­ment of Health Ser­vices told a news con­fer­ence, adding that con­tact trac­ers were over­whelmed and hos­pi­tals may face staffing short­ages.</p>
    <p>“This is go­ing to get worse be­fore it gets bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin broke one-day state records in both cases and deaths; state of­fi­cials told res­i­dents to stay home, wear masks and can­cel so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Alaska set a statewide record for sin­gle-day pos­i­tive tests over the week­end, and some of the hard­esthit parts of the state were ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties with mostly Na­tive Amer­i­can pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, more than 5,600 peo­ple died from the virus in the past week, with hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions ris­ing 13 per cent, a Reuters anal­y­sis showed.</p>
    <p>Record-set­ting lev­els of coro­n­avirus cases are com­ing at the worst pos­si­ble time po­lit­i­cally for US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who is fac­ing a tough re-elec­tion bat­tle on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>“To a cer­tain ex­tent, it’s go­ing to cost him some votes,” said Mr Ed Rollins, a Repub­li­can strate­gist who is chair­man of the pro-Trump Great Amer­ica po­lit­i­cal ac­tion com­mit­tee. “Our vote will hope­fully turn out, but I’d much rather have them in the box than wait­ing for them to come.”</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 spikes will make it more dif­fi­cult for Repub­li­cans to ex­e­cute their voter turnout plans, es­pe­cially with sur­veys show­ing Mr Trump trail­ing his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den, said Mr Kevin Mad­den, a Repub­li­can strate­gist and se­nior ad­viser to Mr Mitt Rom­ney’s 2012 pres­i­den­tial cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Trump on Tues­day re­it­er­ated his claim that the coun­try is “round­ing the turn” in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has killed more than 226,000 peo­ple in the US since erupt­ing in the coun­try in March.</p>
    <p>“We did the ven­ti­la­tors and now we’re do­ing all of the equip­ment and now we’re do­ing vac­cines, we’re do­ing ther­a­peu­tics. We’ve done a great job, and peo­ple are start­ing to see,” Mr Trump told re­porters at the White House.</p>
    <p>Illi­nois Gov­er­nor J.B. Pritzker im­posed fresh rounds of re­stric­tions in seven of 11 re­gions, most re­cently in Chicago. Be­gin­ning to­mor­row, in­door dining in bars and restau­rants will be sus­pended in the Windy City, and gath­er­ings will be lim­ited to 25 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness own­ers in parts of Illi­nois have pushed back against re­stric­tions, cit­ing fi­nan­cial dam­age.</p>
    <p>Other states have walked back re­open­ing plans to curb the spread of the virus as cooler weather sets in across most of the na­tion.</p>
    <p>Idaho Gov­er­nor Brad Lit­tle on Mon­day pro­hib­ited in­door gath­er­ings of more than 50 peo­ple and capped out­door gath­er­ings at 25 per cent ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts be­lieve the virus is surg­ing be­cause of pri­vate so­cial gath­er­ings, colder tem­per­a­tures driv­ing peo­ple in­side, and Amer­i­cans’ fa­tigue with Covid-19 re­stric­tions that have now been in place for more than six months.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the Mid­west, the city of El Paso in Texas is also fac­ing a surge in cases that is over­whelm­ing lo­cal hos­pi­tals, with of­fi­cials set­ting up an al­ter­nate care fa­cil­ity to help re­lieve med­i­cal cen­tres.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing all sorts of pa­tients. The nar­ra­tive his­tor­i­cally has been the above-65, those with mul­ti­ple co-mor­bidi­ties. But we’re see­ing 20-year-olds. We’re see­ing 30-yearolds, 40-year-olds,” Dr Ogechika Alozie, an in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist in El Paso, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Denver Mayor Michael Han­cock an­nounced he was re­in­stat­ing some coro­n­avirus rules to com­bat what city of­fi­cials de­scribed as a “dra­matic rise” in Covid-19 cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants, re­tail busi­nesses and of­fices will have their 50 per cent ca­pac­ity slashed in half, the mayor said, while events will be capped at 25 peo­ple in­doors and 75 out­doors.</p>
    <p>Colorado re­ported a record one­day in­crease in cases on Mon­day, and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions have risen 60 per cent in the last two weeks to 571.</p>
    <p>The per­cent­age of pos­i­tive tests has more than dou­bled this month to over 7 per cent. How­ever, the num­ber of those hos­pi­talised in the state is far be­low the record 1,000 in April.</p>
