    <p>RE­VIEW / CON­CERT</p>
    <p>HAYDN’S EM­PEROR AND TCHAIKOVSK­Y’S FLORENCE Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Or­ches­tra Vic­to­ria Con­cert Hall Last Thurs­day</p>
    <p>OMM RESTARTS! Or­ches­tra of the Mu­sic Mak­ers Sin­ga­pore Con­fer­ence Hall Sun­day</p>
    <p>Since Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Or­ches­tra’s en­try al­most a month ago, other or­ches­tras have also got on the act, thanks to the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s live per­for­mance pi­lots.</p>
    <p>Con­certs are, how­ever, still lim­ited to cham­ber-sized groups, at­tended by au­di­ences of just 50 so­cially dis­tanced heads.</p>
    <p>Ten string play­ers of the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Or­ches­tra pre­sented two pop­u­lar works of the cham­ber reper­toire. Joseph Haydn’s String Quar­tet In C Ma­jor (Op. 76 No. 3) is the most fa­mil­iar of his 68 string quar­tets, largely be­cause of its slow sec­ond move­ment. It is a set of vari­a­tions on Haydn’s own Em­peror’s Hymn, later adopted as Aus­tria and Ger­many’s na­tional an­them.</p>
    <p>The arch sim­plic­ity of its melody and sub­se­quent vari­a­tions was well re­alised by the quar­tet of vi­o­lin­ists Xu Jue Yi and Chikako Sasaki, vi­o­list Wang Dan­dan and cel­list Wang Zi­hao. In­ci­sive­ness and clar­ity marked the open­ing move­ment, while hu­mour filled the 3rd move­ment’s min­uet and trio.</p>
    <p>The mood turned se­ri­ous in the fi­nale, but its storms and stresses were soon dis­pelled as day­light shone at its con­clu­sion, hap­pily back in the key of C ma­jor.</p>
    <p>Just as en­joy­able was Tchaikovsk­y’s String Sex­tet In D Mi­nor, also known as Sou­venir De Florence. Here the six play­ers – vi­o­lin­ists Chen Da Wei and Niko­lai Ko­val, vi­o­lists Jan­ice Tsai and Ma­ri­etta Ku, cel­lists Yu Jing and Guo Hao – func­tioned like a mini string or­ches­tra, one gen­er­at­ing a rich sonor­ity.</p>
    <p>De­spite its mi­nor key, this was one of Tchaikovsk­y’s sun­ni­est scores, re­flect­ing the Mediter­ranean warmth of its in­spi­ra­tion. The mu­si­cians dived head­long into the mu­sic, with cau­tion thrown to the wind. This made for ex­cit­ing lis­ten­ing, bal­anced by sen­si­tive and lovely solo play­ing from the first chairs.</p>
    <p>It was a larger group of 23 string play­ers when the Or­ches­tra of the Mu­sic Mak­ers took to the stage, con­ducted by Chan Tze Law. Schu­bert’s dra­matic lied Er­lkonig (Erl King), as ar­ranged by Lee Jin­jun, re­sounded with Wag­ne­r­ian ve­he­mence and vigour, mak­ing for a stir­ring pre­lude. Young com­poser Jonathan Shin’s Folk Games put three lo­cal songs through a dis­tort­ing prism: Who would have guessed that Rasa Sayang, Sin­ga­pura and Chan Mali Chan could sound like Shostakovi­ch or the Sec­ond Vi­en­nese School?</p>
    <p>Two oboists and two French hor­nists joined the strings for the 1st move­ment of Haydn’s Cello Con­certo In D Ma­jor. Here, cel­list Qin Li-Wei put on a daz­zling dis­play in a work far more tech­ni­cally de­mand­ing than ini­tially sus­pected. This was topped by a bril­liant ca­denza writ­ten by Shin, that un­apolo­get­i­cally over­flowed into over­the-top Ro­man­tic-era vir­tu­os­ity. Soloist and or­ches­tra also threw in Brahms’ Hun­gar­ian Dance No. 5 as a wel­come en­core.</p>
    <p>John Rut­ter’s pleas­ing Suite For Strings, all four move­ments based on folk songs from the Bri­tish isles, con­cluded an en­joy­able evening.</p>
