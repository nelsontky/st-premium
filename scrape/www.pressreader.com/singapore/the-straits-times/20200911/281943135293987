    <p>Around 200 Repub­lic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) ser­vice­men and air­craft from three squadrons will be de­ployed to Aus­tralia next month, in the first phys­i­cal de­ploy­ment there since large-scale over­seas drills were sus­pended in May.</p>
    <p>RSAF ser­vice­men will be train­ing in the airspace around the Royal Aus­tralian Air Force’s Base Dar­win be­tween Oct 7 and Dec 11, the RSAF an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>About 200 RSAF ser­vice­men will use the train­ing grounds for flight and live weapons train­ing, ac­cord­ing to Aus­tralia’s Depart­ment of De­fence. It said the Singapore units tak­ing part will in­clude the 149 Squadron fly­ing the F-15SG air­craft, the 112 Squadron fly­ing a Multi Role Tanker Trans­port air­craft and the 111 Squadron with a G550 Air­borne Early Warn­ing air­craft.</p>
    <p>The grad­ual re­sump­tion of over­seas train­ing comes af­ter the Min­istry of De­fence said on May 12 that it had sus­pended all largescale over­seas ex­er­cises due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded Ex­er­cise Wal­laby, the Singapore Armed Forces’ (SAF) largest over­seas drill that has been held in Queens­land, Aus­tralia, every year since 1990.</p>
    <p>The SAF last week said it will step up the train­ing tempo in the com­ing months, and will pro­gres­sively re­sume na­tional ser­vice in-camp train­ing from next month.</p>
    <p>The RSAF de­ploy­ment shows Aus­tralia’s close de­fence part­ner­ship with Singapore, Aus­tralian De­fence Min­is­ter Linda Reynolds said.</p>
    <p>“Singapore’s mil­i­tary train­ing in Aus­tralia is an im­por­tant el­e­ment of our Com­pre­hen­sive Strate­gic Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>“It sup­ports Singapore’s abil­ity to gen­er­ate a force that pro­vides strate­gic weight and sup­ports sta­bil­ity in our re­gion,” she said.</p>
    <p>The RSAF said on Face­book that it has been work­ing closely with its Aus­tralian coun­ter­part to en­sure that the nec­es­sary health and safety pre­cau­tions are in place to min­imise the risk of coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Prior to ar­riv­ing in Aus­tralia, RSAF ser­vice­men will spend seven days in self-iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>They will also have to take a Covid-19 test 48 hours be­fore they ar­rive in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Upon ar­rival, they will be quar­an­tined for 14 days at spe­cially pre­pared ho­tel ac­com­mo­da­tion in the</p>
    <p>Dar­win area that will be se­cured and man­aged by the Aus­tralian De­fence Force.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice­men will then be retested af­ter their quar­an­tine ends.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Ex­er­cise Wal­laby, of­fi­cer cadet train­ing in Brunei and ar­mour train­ing in Ger­many were also among those af­fected by the May sus­pen­sion of large-scale over­seas train­ing.</p>
    <p>Min­def had said in June, ahead of SAF Day on July 1, that over­seas ex­er­cises would grad­u­ally re­sume on a se­lec­tive ba­sis.</p>
    <p>The first ma­jor for­eign drill that the SAF has par­tic­i­pated in since then was the Rim of the Pa­cific (Rim­pac) Ex­er­cise, which took place in the state of Hawaii in the United States from Aug 17 to Aug 31.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic of Singapore Navy served as task group com­man­der dur­ing Rim­pac, the world’s largest in­ter­na­tional mar­itime ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>This year’s edi­tion was a scaled­down ver­sion of the usual ex­er­cise. It was also con­ducted en­tirely at sea, with no phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tions among the par­tic­i­pants, ac­cord­ing to Min­def.</p>
