        Features Life | | C6 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 30, 2020 Supervisin­g home-based learning while on quarantine Juggling extra work, a newborn and home-based learning for his own kids “Cher, what’s the noise outside? Is someone crying?”
Mr Andy Wang smiles as he describes the puzzled faces of his students – the term “Cher” is an affectiona­te nickname for teacher – while he conducted lessons online during the circuit breaker.
Beyond the closed door of his study room, his wife Grace, 30, a social worker, pacified their newborn baby. Their eldest child, Samuel, three, was quarrellin­g with his brother, Ethan, two.
Life under lockdown was anything but peaceful.
“Everything just happened together at one go,” recalls Mr Wang, 33, a lead educationa­l therapist who has been with the Dyslexia Associatio­n of Singapore (DAS) for eight years. The social enterprise helps those with learning difficulty and other learning difference­s.
He holds a master’s degree in education (special education) and is a core member of the Prep 2 PSLE team, which prepares dyslexic students for national exams. In addition, he teaches its Main Literacy Programme for kids from Primary 1 up to Secondary 5.
The Wangs welcomed baby Emma in late March, just before the two-month circuit breaker started on April 7. Mr Wang, who had already been covering for his programme manager, who had gone on maternity leave in February, had less than a week to prepare for home-based learning (HBL) with his team members. He remembers “meeting after meeting” and a “huge chunk of time” spent creating five-minute recorded lessons for children without access to gadgets for e-learning.
At home, his wife was occupied with the baby, while their helper was busy with chores in their fiveroom flat in the north-east. In between work, he had to look after the two boys from breakfast until bedtime.
Something had to give. While he concentrat­ed on helping his students, Mr Wang admits that he “didn’t really follow through” with his son Samuel’s Nursery 1 HBL homework and activities.
“We substitute­d a lot with playtime and storybook time. During breaks, I would take them down to the small park below my home for a quick walk and to pick mimosas,” he says.
He worked instead at managing his boys’ emotional wellness during the first two weeks of the circuit breaker. Deprived of their everyday routines, “they would sometimes cry for no reason, over little things”.
While he limited screen time with toys like a mini slide and magnetic building tiles, their short attention span meant that the boys would regularly invade his home office and video-bomb his meetings and lessons.
“Thankfully, they’re still at an age where they’re quite cute,” he quips, adding that he is grateful his colleagues and students welcomed his kids’ appearance­s. Adjusting to teaching online was challengin­g, as he was used to getting instant feedback from students in the classroom.
He also had to be extra vigilant online. He spotted a Primary 3 student surfing other websites during HBL because the boy happened to have a mirror behind him.
“It’s funny to think of it now, but these were the challenges for teachers. I imagine more so for (school) teachers with 30 to 40 students. For us, it’s four to five children.”
Physical classes have resumed progressiv­ely at DAS’ learning centres since late June, but space is limited because of safety measures. While he used to have back-to-back classes from 4 to 9pm on teaching days – students typically attend DAS lessons after school – there is now a 30-minute break between sessions for classroom cleaning.
This means that not all students have returned for classes, with priority going to those taking national exams and those in Primary 1 and 2.
With prolonged e-learning, fatigue has set in for some kids.
“At the start of HBL, it’s a novelty, it’s online, things are moving and the screen is changing constantly. It keeps them hooked.”
Now, though, he says: “I can see some of them get tired of it; the lack of face-to-face communicat­ion. We have to continuall­y think of new and interestin­g ways to keep them engaged.”
Still, he finds his work meaning- PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
