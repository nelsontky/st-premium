    <p>A former pri­mary school teacher phys­i­cally abused her young step­son mul­ti­ple times be­tween 2016 and 2018, caus­ing in­juries such as cuts to his scalp that re­quired stitches af­ter she struck him with a ce­ramic mug.</p>
    <p>On one oc­ca­sion, the wo­man who re­signed from teach­ing in 2013 punched his nose, caus­ing it to bleed.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the 44-yearold Sin­ga­porean made de­mean­ing re­marks, call­ing the boy a “pros­ti­tute’s child”.</p>
    <p>She also tore up his Good Con­duct Award, claim­ing that he did not de­serve it.</p>
    <p>The wo­man pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to three counts of ill-treat­ing a child. She can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect the child’s iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Daphne Lim said the boy lived with his father, step­mother and step­sis­ter in a flat in the east­ern part of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber 2016, the step­mother and the boy, who was then 11, were at home when she flew into a rage be­cause he did not wash his plate af­ter a meal.</p>
    <p>She or­dered him to wash it, but while he was car­ry­ing out her in­struc­tions, she struck the back of his head with a mug.</p>
    <p>The boy was taken to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal (KKH) the next day. There, he was found to have three scalp lac­er­a­tions that needed stitch­ing up.</p>
    <p>In an­other in­ci­dent on May 19, 2017, she re­peat­edly slapped the boy’s face af­ter he failed to re­call a cer­tain English test ques­tion.</p>
    <p>The boy went to a rel­a­tive’s home the next day and his pa­ter­nal aunt lodged a po­lice re­port af­ter see­ing her nephew’s in­juries.</p>
    <p>She took him to KKH, where he was found with abra­sions over both cheeks, and a “mod­er­ate de­tach­ment” of one of his teeth.</p>
    <p>The step­mother gave a po­lice state­ment on May 22, 2017, and was aware that she was un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for child abuse.</p>
    <p>She did not in­flict phys­i­cal harm on the boy from May 2017 to June 2018.</p>
    <p>Then, on July 20, 2018, she went back to her old ways and punched the boy’s nose, caus­ing it to bleed, af­ter she caught him ly­ing about some house­work.</p>
    <p>A week later, she found out that he did not at­tend re­me­dial classes in school and slapped his face sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>The boy’s teacher later spot­ted his in­juries and alerted the school’s vice-prin­ci­pal.</p>
    <p>The po­lice were no­ti­fied and the boy was taken to KKH on July 30 that year.</p>
    <p>A med­i­cal re­port the fol­low­ing month stated that he had in­juries, in­clud­ing mul­ti­ple bruises.</p>
    <p>The step­mother is now out on bail of $8,000 and she will be sen­tenced on Oct 6.</p>
