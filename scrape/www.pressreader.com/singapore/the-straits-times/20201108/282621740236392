    <p>A per­sis­tent low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment and a tougher risk-based cap­i­tal frame­work would make it harder for Sin­ga­pore life in­sur­ers to de­liver the pro­jected non-guar­an­teed bonuses linked to par­tic­i­pat­ing or par funds, even though most of the 10 key life in­sur­ers are able to at least sup­port any such pay­outs.</p>
    <p>Based on in­sur­ers’ 2019 re­turns that were filed with the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), Man­ulife Sin­ga­pore, Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore and AIA Sin­ga­pore topped the geo­met­ric av­er­age net in­vest­ment re­turns for par funds for the three-year, five-year and 10-year pe­ri­ods re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Man­ulife topped the 2017-2019 pe­riod at 7.68 per cent, while AXA Sin­ga­pore and Tokio Ma­rine Life In­surance Sin­ga­pore fol­lowed at 7.44 per cent and 7.12 per cent re­spec­tively, higher than the group av­er­age of 6.69 per cent.</p>
    <p>Over a five-year pe­riod from 2015, Pru­den­tial took pole po­si­tion with 6 per cent, fol­lowed by AIA with 5.91 per cent and NTUC In­come at 5.33 per cent. The group av­er­age was 4.99 per cent.</p>
    <p>The group av­er­age from 2010 was 4.61 per cent and AIA topped this cat­e­gory at 6.21 per cent.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial fol­lowed at 5.84 per cent and AXA at 5.18 per cent.</p>
    <p>Etiqa In­surance was op­er­a­tional in Sin­ga­pore from 2014, so it has no 10-year av­er­age re­turns.</p>
    <p>The in­surer pointed out that as a rel­a­tively new player, high growth of the to­tal par as­sets would have dis­torted the ra­tio.</p>
    <p>To il­lus­trate, in 2015, Etiqa’s cash hold­ing was $22.2 mil­lion and in­vest­ment as­sets (equities and bonds) were $29.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>This then re­sulted in lower in­vest­ment in­come and, ac­cord­ingly, lower re­turns, it said.</p>
    <p>When asked, Man­ulife chief cus­tomer and prod­uct of­fi­cer Dar­ren Thomp­son said the firm di­ver­si­fied in­vest­ments in re­cent years and the change in strat­egy has worked well so far.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer David Chua said the firm uses “care­fully cu­rated fund strate­gies”.</p>
    <p>The key con­sid­er­a­tion in in­sur­ers de­cid­ing the level of yearly re­ver­sion­ary bonus rates of par poli­cies is in­vest­ment per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>There are other fac­tors that weigh in, such as the ex­penses, claims and sur­ren­ders, but sources say these are more im­pact­ful for small par funds and less so for large and ma­ture par funds like those of AIA, Pru­den­tial and Man­ulife.</p>
    <p>They pointed out that the three­year av­er­age “car­ries more weight in de­ter­min­ing bonus dec­la­ra­tions” as it is more re­flec­tive of cur­rent trends. Those that per­form well are also in a bet­ter po­si­tion to weather storms.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the two pro­jected in­vest­ment rates of re­turns shown in the ben­e­fit il­lus­tra­tion of par prod­ucts are 3.25 and 4.75 per cent per an­num. Of the three-year in­dus­try av­er­ages, all play­ers clocked higher rates than the two pro­jec­tions listed.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers say pres­sure is build­ing for a down­ward re­vi­sion of the two pro­jec­tions in the light of in­creas­ing global volatil­ity. The Life In­surance As­so­ci­a­tion con­ducts an an­nual re­view on this.</p>
    <p>To­gether with in­sur­ers’ av­er­age net in­vest­ment re­turns, re­serve ra­tios will paint a clearer pic­ture for pol­i­cy­hold­ers on whether in­sur­ers are likely to ad­just non-guar­an­teed bonuses. Re­serve ra­tios are cal­cu­lated by com­par­ing an in­surer’s re­serve buf­fer against its to­tal as­sets.</p>
    <p>Data showed that from 2017 to last year, Pru­den­tial, which did not cut bonus rates for FY2019, had the high­est buf­fer of be­tween 39 per cent and 43.6 per cent, while</p>
    <p>HSBC In­surance’s re­serve ra­tio slid from 14 per cent in 2017 to 10.5 per cent last year – the low­est of the 10 in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>“At HSBC Life Sin­ga­pore, we reg­u­larly re­view our bonus pay­out for par­tic­i­pat­ing prod­ucts. The aim is to en­sure our cus­tomers will re­ceive a sta­ble re­turn over time re­gard­less of mar­ket con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“It is also im­por­tant to note that be­sides mar­ket per­for­mance, fac­tors such as risk ap­petite of the in­surer and prod­uct spec­i­fi­ca­tions in­clud­ing level of guar­an­tees and risk passed on to cus­tomers would also im­pact par fund re­turns,” said the in­surer.</p>
    <p>It added that it has in­creased in­vest­ments in al­ter­na­tive as­set classes “which will di­ver­sify the port­fo­lio and ul­ti­mately achieve bet­ter re­turns over the long term for our par pol­i­cy­hold­ers”.</p>
    <p>Etiqa, whose re­serve ra­tio for the three years is mixed, at­trib­uted this to prod­uct mix, which play­ers agree can have an im­pact.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, ob­servers cau­tioned that to­day’s low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment may im­pact fu­ture in­vest­ment re­turns of par funds, and in turn lead to pos­si­bly lower re­serve ra­tios that are an im­por­tant fac­tor in con­sid­er­ing whether a div­i­dend ad­just­ment may be needed.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the stricter riskbased cap­i­tal frame­work known as RBC2 now in place, it is more costly for in­sur­ers to man­age par funds and to bal­ance be­tween prof­itabil­ity and pro­vid­ing at­trac­tive re­turns to par pol­i­cy­hold­ers, they said.</p>
    <p>About half of the new busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore’s life in­surance in­dus­try come from par plans.</p>
    <p>Mr Thomp­son said: “With lower in­ter­est rates, the amount of cap­i­tal re­quired to sup­port prod­ucts with high guar­an­tees will be more.</p>
    <p>“This may just mean that in­surance com­pa­nies will have to in­no­vate to find al­ter­na­tive in­no­va­tive prod­uct so­lu­tions to sup­port the needs of the cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>Asked if Pru­den­tial would change its as­set mix to man­age cap­i­tal costs, Mr Chua said: “We have been im­ple­ment­ing ways to bet­ter re­alise cap­i­tal ef­fi­ciency and man­age the cost of cap­i­tal. Any as­set mix changes will take into ac­count the pos­si­ble im­pli­ca­tions to prod­uct guar­an­tees to pol­i­cy­hold­ers.”</p>
    <p>To­gether with in­sur­ers’ av­er­age net in­vest­ment re­turns, re­serve ra­tios will paint a clearer pic­ture for pol­i­cy­hold­ers on whether in­sur­ers are likely to ad­just non-guar­an­teed bonuses. Re­serve ra­tios are cal­cu­lated by com­par­ing an in­surer’s re­serve buf­fer against its to­tal as­sets.</p>
