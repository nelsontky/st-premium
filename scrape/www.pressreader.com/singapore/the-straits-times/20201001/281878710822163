    <p>BER­LIN Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel has ac­cused China of “poor and cruel treat­ment” of mi­nori­ties and un­der­lined deep con­cerns over the crack­down on dis­sent in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>In a speech yes­ter­day at the Bun­destag, a day be­fore a Euro­pean Union sum­mit, Dr Merkel vowed to bring up is­sues of rights and Ger­many’s wor­ries over the sit­u­a­tion in the for­mer Bri­tish colony in any fu­ture di­a­logue with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has been un­der fire from the United States and Bri­tain over a na­tional se­cu­rity law it im­posed on Hong Kong on June 30 that pun­ishes any­thing China con­sid­ers as sub­ver­sion, se­ces­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces, with up to life in prison.</p>
    <p>“Of course we have to bring up our dif­fer­ent opin­ions in talks,” said Dr Merkel, whose coun­try cur­rently holds the ro­tat­ing pres­i­dency of the EU. “That’s why we have flagged up our deep con­cern about the de­vel­op­ment in Hong Kong. The prin­ci­ple of ‘one coun­try, two sys­tems’ stands, but again and again it’s be­ing un­der­mined.</p>
    <p>“We will bring that up, as well as the poor and cruel treat­ment in part of the rights of the mi­nori­ties in China.”</p>
    <p>She did not name the mi­nori­ties, but ac­tivists have ac­cused China of the mass in­tern­ment of Mus­lim Uighurs in Xin­jiang and have re­peat­edly urged Ger­many to give them more sup­port.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi’s visit to Ber­lin last month, demon­stra­tors, in­clud­ing Hong Kong dis­si­dent Nathan Law, protested out­side the Ger­man For­eign Min­istry, de­mand­ing more ac­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with China a key mar­ket for Ger­many’s ex­porters, Ber­lin has sought to main­tain strong ties with the Asian gi­ant.</p>
    <p>Still, the Ger­man gov­ern­ment is said to be plan­ning tougher over­sight of telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions net­work ven­dors that – while stop­ping short of a ban on Huawei – will make it harder for the Chi­nese tele­coms gi­ant to keep a foothold in Europe’s largest mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Three coali­tion and gov­ern­ment sources said yes­ter­day that an agree­ment had been reached in prin­ci­ple to ex­tend scru­tiny of a ven­dor’s gov­er­nance and tech­nol­ogy to ra­dio ac­cess net­works pow­er­ing next-gen­er­a­tion 5G ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The Han­dels­blatt daily re­ported ear­lier that af­ter two years of wran­gling, Dr Merkel’s coali­tion had agreed on a for­mula for how to han­dle so-called high-risk ven­dors in a pro­posed in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel’s spokesman, Mr St­ef­fen Seib­ert, de­clined to com­ment on the Han­dels­blatt story, telling a gov­ern­ment news con­fer­ence that the same se­cu­rity stan­dards would ap­ply to all ven­dors.</p>
    <p>The in­te­rior and econ­omy min­istries, both run by Merkel al­lies, said dis­cus­sions on the leg­is­la­tion were con­tin­u­ing.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean gov­ern­ments have been re­view­ing Huawei’s role in the build­ing of their net­works fol­low­ing pressure from the US, which says it poses a se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>EU lead­ers will to­day call for an eco­nomic re­bal­anc­ing with China and greater rec­i­proc­ity be­tween the two sides, part of a re­think by Brus­sels over how to en­gage with the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>EU lead­ers will also re­it­er­ate at a sum­mit in Brus­sels the goal of fi­nal­is­ing by the end of this year ne­go­ti­a­tions for an “am­bi­tious” EU-China Com­pre­hen­sive In­vest­ment Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment aims to be one that ad­dresses “cur­rent asym­me­tries in mar­ket ac­cess, en­sures a level play­ing field, and es­tab­lishes mean­ing­ful com­mit­ments on sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment”, ac­cord­ing to a draft of a joint com­mu­nique seen by Bloomberg that is subject to change.</p>
