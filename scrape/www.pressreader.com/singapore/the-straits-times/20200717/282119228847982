    <p>The gra­cious­ness showed and timely re­sponses given by the Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) were a breath of fresh air (ELD to look into what went wrong on Polling Day, July 14).</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, this rep­re­sents, to use the lat­est cliche, “the new nor­mal” of civil ser­vice re­sponse to un­for­tu­nate events.</p>
    <p>While the elec­tion date was kept con­fi­den­tial for ob­vi­ous rea­sons, there was suf­fi­cient time for the ELD to have walked the ground to get a feel of the queu­ing con­di­tions, among other things.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of al­lo­cat­ing se­niors spe­cial hours for vot­ing was good but, un­for­tu­nately, this gave rise to other is­sues, such as the need for trans­porta­tion to the lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>To en­hance the ex­cel­lent man­ner in which the ELD re­sponded on Polling Day – the ex­ten­sion of vot­ing hours and sub­se­quent tweaks of the process – I hope that the ELD would in­clude grass­roots groups in the re­view­ing process, as well as open up a chan­nel through which vot­ers can list the chal­lenges they faced.</p>
    <p>Trans­parency must also be re­cip­ro­cated on the part of those fil­ing their com­ments. Hope­fully, this will pro­vide much more data in this whole feed­back ex­er­cise.</p>
