    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) has or­dered Wire­card to stop its pay­ment ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore, in a move that will force busi­nesses that still use the Ger­man firm’s sys­tems for credit card and other dig­i­tal pay­ments to shift to other op­tions.</p>
    <p>Some users of Wire­card SG’s pre­paid cards will be af­fected as well, said the reg­u­la­tor yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Wire­card also has to re­turn all cus­tomers’ funds by Oct 14. The Straits Times un­der­stands that this refers to funds held by Wire­card as part of pro­cess­ing pay­ments for mer­chants, as well as cor­po­rate cus­tomers which is­sue pre-paid cards.</p>
    <p>Once a fin­tech gi­ant with busi­nesses span­ning the globe, Wire­card filed for bank­ruptcy in June af­ter dis­clos­ing that €1.9 bil­lion (S$3 bil­lion) in cash, sup­posed to be in bank ac­counts in the Philip­pines, did not ex­ist.</p>
    <p>Pay­ment gate­ways like Wire­card act as a link be­tween fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. When a bank cus­tomer pays for his pur­chase at a re­tailer us­ing a credit card, pay­ment gate­ways alert the card­holder’s bank that a trans­ac­tion is in process.</p>
    <p>Banks will then in­di­cate whether the cus­tomer has suf­fi­cient credit to make the pur­chase. The re­tailer re­ceives the pay­ment and the pay­ment gate­way typ­i­cally re­ceives a cut from the trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Wire­card’s main busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore are to process Visa and Master­card pay­ments for mer­chants and help com­pa­nies is­sue pre-paid cards.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is home to Wire­card’s Asia-Pa­cific head­quar­ters in Pasir Pan­jang. Wire­card was still listed as a ten­ant at the build­ing when ST vis­ited the premises yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MAS said it has been mon­i­tor­ing the im­pact of par­ent com­pany Wire­card AG’s in­sol­vency on the abil­ity of its Sin­ga­pore en­ti­ties to con­tinue pro­vid­ing pay­ment ser­vices here.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Wire­card SG has told the author­ity that it is un­able to con­tinue pro­vid­ing pay­ment pro­cess­ing ser­vices to a “sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of mer­chants”, it said.</p>
    <p>As such, MAS as­sessed that it is in the in­ter­est of the pub­lic for Wire­card SG to cease its pay­ment ser­vices and promptly re­turn all cus­tomers’ funds, it said. “This pro­vides the great­est cer­tainty to cus­tomers on their ap­pro­pri­ate course of ac­tion, in­clud­ing seek­ing alternativ­e ser­vice providers.”</p>
    <p>Alternativ­e forms of e-pay­ment avail­able in Sin­ga­pore in­clude Nets, PayNow and SGQR. In ad­di­tion, banks such as DBS, United Over­seas Bank and OCBC, as well as pay­ment ser­vices provider Nets, pro­vide mer­chant ac­qui­si­tion ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Some mer­chants that have used Wire­card are now of­fer­ing con­sumers other pay­ment op­tions while oth­ers are ad­just­ing. For ex­am­ple, the Bread­Talk out­let at VivoCity did not ac­cept credit cards when ST vis­ited yes­ter­day, sug­gest­ing that cus­tomers use cash in­stead.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that com­pa­nies across var­i­ous sec­tors such as Sub­way and Gong Cha had used Wire­card, al­though it is un­clear if and when they made a switch.</p>
    <p>Sheng Siong Group chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Hock Chee said yes­ter­day that the gro­cery chain had al­ready moved away from us­ing Wire­card. It of­fers a range of pay­ment op­tions in­clud­ing Nets and credit card.</p>
    <p>Chef Park Tan, who owns In­done­sian restau­rant Pagi Sore, said Wire­card was the main pro­ces­sor of credit cards for his busi­ness, but he switched to an­other pay­ment pro­ces­sor, First Data, af­ter news of the miss­ing bil­lions hit the head­lines.</p>
    <p>He said: “There was no ad­di­tional cost in switch­ing but it was trou­ble­some. Things are al­ready bad for busi­nesses dur­ing this pan­demic and then this hits...</p>
    <p>“I imag­ine that some who have not switched will be scram­bling now be­cause it takes a while to change to a new pro­ces­sor.”</p>
    <p>En­ti­ties un­der Wire­card are not cur­rently li­censed by MAS.</p>
    <p>Ger­man dig­i­tal pay­ment firm Wire­card was once a huge fin­tech gi­ant, pro­vid­ing cash­less pay­ment ser­vices to big in­ter­na­tional brands such as Sam­sung, Google and Ap­ple.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, it had ma­jor clients like taxi firm Com­fortDelGro, con­ve­nience chain Cheers and telco Sing­tel for its mo­bile wal­let Dash, and was also be­ing used for ev­ery­day pur­poses such as at Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing gantries and for con­sumers to top up their ez-link cards on their mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>It also sup­ported a large net­work of re­tail­ers and other busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>But in June, the firm col­lapsed in dra­matic fash­ion, ow­ing cred­i­tors al­most US$4 bil­lion (S$5.5 bil­lion) af­ter dis­clos­ing a hole in its books.</p>
    <p>It ad­mit­ted that €1.9 bil­lion (S$3 bil­lion) of cash, sup­posed to be in bank ac­counts in the Philip­pines, did not ex­ist – in what was de­scribed as the largest au­dit­ing scan­dal since US en­ergy com­pany En­ron’s demise in 2001.</p>
    <p>Wire­card’s fall from grace will cer­tainly have some im­pact on con­sumer con­fi­dence and the mer­chants that it as­sisted, even if the mer­chants have a range of other pay­ment op­tions avail­able to them, ex­perts told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate gov­er­nance ad­vo­cate and Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) Busi­ness School as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Mak Yuen Teen said: “This case shows the risks out­side the tra­di­tional fi­nan­cial sec­tor, in­clud­ing in pay­ments pro­cess­ing com­pa­nies like Wire­card, fin­techs and dig­i­tal banks.”</p>
    <p>He added that it could also have an im­pact on reg­u­la­tions, es­pe­cially since new rules for pay­ment ser­vices were in­tro­duced this year.</p>
    <p>“This episode may prompt reg­u­la­tors to have a closer look at the cor­po­rate gov­er­nance re­quire­ments for com­pa­nies in the e-pay­ments ecosys­tem out­side of the bank­ing sec­tor, and ex­er­cise greater vig­i­lance over the fil­ing and au­dit of fi­nan­cial state­ments of th­ese com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>Wire­card’s un­rav­el­ling took a sig­nif­i­cant turn early last year, when the Fi­nan­cial Times pub­lished re­ports about al­leged wrong­do­ing at its Sin­ga­pore of­fice that sent shares in Ger­many tum­bling. Fol­low­ing the re­ports, the Sin­ga­pore po­lice raided the Wire­card of­fice in Pasir Pan­jang in Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>The sus­pi­cions re­gard­ing Wire­card’s ac­count­ing practices per­sisted, with chair­man Wulf Matthias re­sign­ing in Jan­uary fol­low­ing months of con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>Mr Markus Braun, its chief ex­ec­u­tive, re­signed in June af­ter au­di­tor EY re­fused to sign off on the firm’s 2019 ac­counts, declar­ing that some €1.9 bil­lion had gone miss­ing. EY also said there were clear in­di­ca­tions Wire­card was in­volved in a fraud with mul­ti­ple par­ties around the world in dif­fer­ent in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore po­lice and the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore then launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into sev­eral lo­cal com­pa­nies in re­la­tion to the Wire­card scan­dal. In Au­gust, Sin­ga­porean R. Shan­mu­garat­nam, direc­tor of Ci­tadelle Cor­po­rate Ser­vices, was charged with fal­si­fy­ing ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Given that Wire­card is un­likely to re­vive its for­tunes, re­tail­ers in Sin­ga­pore will have to turn to other</p>
    <p>CLOSER SCRU­TINY</p>
    <p>This episode may prompt reg­u­la­tors to have a closer look at the cor­po­rate gov­er­nance re­quire­ments for com­pa­nies in the e-pay­ments ecosys­tem out­side of the bank­ing sec­tor, and ex­er­cise greater vig­i­lance over the fil­ing and au­dit of fi­nan­cial state­ments of th­ese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR MAK YUEN TEEN of the NUS Busi­ness School, on the pos­si­ble im­pact on reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>SWITCH­ING TO OTHER OP­TIONS</p>
    <p>We also ad­vise them on pay­ment ac­cep­tance op­tions such as us­ing uni­fied point-of-sale ter­mi­nals which en­able them to ac­cept a wide range of pay­ment schemes through a sin­gle ter­mi­nal as well as how they can ac­cept new pay­ment schemes such as Ali­pay and WeChat Pay.</p>
    <p>MS CHOO WAN SIM, UOB’s head of cards and pay­ments, Sin­ga­pore, who says many mer­chants have sought its guid­ance lately.</p>
    <p>forms of e-pay­ment such as Nets.</p>
    <p>“Since Wire­card has quite a sig­nif­i­cant pres­ence here, there is likely to be some dis­rup­tion. Cus­tomers who have Wire­card pre­paid cards will also be af­fected,” said Prof Mak.</p>
    <p>Ms Choo Wan Sim, United Over­seas Bank’s (UOB) head of cards and pay­ments, Sin­ga­pore, said many mer­chants have sought the bank’s guid­ance in the last two months on how to cre­ate more cer­tainty around their pay­ment pro­cess­ing op­tions, or to be­come part of UOB’s mer­chant net­work.</p>
    <p>“We also ad­vise them on pay­ment ac­cep­tance op­tions such as us­ing uni­fied point-of-sale ter­mi­nals which en­able them to ac­cept a wide range of pay­ment schemes through a sin­gle ter­mi­nal as well as how they can ac­cept new pay­ment schemes such as Ali­pay and WeChat Pay,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that th­ese mer­chants come from a range of sec­tors, in­clud­ing re­tail, e-com­merce, su­per­mar­ket, food and bev­er­age, and in­surance.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh, also from NUS Busi­ness School and who is direc­tor of the Cen­tre for Gov­er­nance, In­sti­tu­tions and Or­gan­i­sa­tions, said that while mer­chants may cur­rently find it in­con­ve­nient to switch to an­other sys­tem, it will at most be a one-off event. He also ob­served that the is­sue is due more to cor­po­rate fraud than to any in­her­ent prob­lems in dig­i­tal pay­ments.</p>
    <p>“It will take more than a Wire­card in­ci­dent for con­sumer con­fi­dence in e-pay­ments to be re­ally rocked.”</p>
