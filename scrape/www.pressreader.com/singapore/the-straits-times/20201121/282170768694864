    <p>The sun is fi­nally shin­ing on green en­ergy jobs in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment’s re­cent de­ci­sion to set more am­bi­tious so­lar en­ergy tar­gets for 2025 and 2030 has opened the way for po­ten­tially thou­sands of new jobs here, a lead­ing in­dus­try fig­ure tells In­sight.</p>
    <p>And over time, Sin­ga­pore could be­come a re­gional hub for sus­tain­abil­ity busi­nesses, with an ecosys­tem of green fi­nanc­ing, le­gal ser­vices, re­new­able en­ergy project de­sign and man­age­ment, and train­ing.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, ma­jor over­seas in­vestors such as pen­sion funds are look­ing to make large in­vest­ments in the re­gion to help the tran­si­tion away from pol­lut­ing fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>This should fur­ther drive green en­ergy job growth in Asia, which al­ready has a large re­new­able en­ergy work­force, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Re­new­able En­ergy Agency (Irena).</p>
    <p>“Each US$1 mil­lion (S$1.35 mil­lion) in­vested in re­new­ables in the en­ergy trans­for­ma­tion will cre­ate 25 jobs. The same in­vest­ment will cre­ate 10 jobs in en­ergy ef­fi­ciency – three times more than the tra­di­tional con­ven­tional fos­sil fuel plant in­vest­ments,” Mr Francesco La Cam­era, di­rec­tor-gen­eral of Irena, said at the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week last month.</p>
    <p>He added that jobs in the re­new­able en­ergy sec­tor to­talled more than 11.5 mil­lion last year, more than a third of them in China. Asia ac­counted for 63 per cent of to­tal jobs in re­new­ables glob­ally.</p>
    <p>By 2023, ac­cel­er­at­ing in­vest­ment i n the en­ergy tran­si­tion could cre­ate an ad­di­tional 5.5 mil­lion jobs, ac­cord­ing to Irena.</p>
    <p>In the longer term, the Asia-Pa­cific is fore­cast to ac­count for more than 40 per cent of ex­pected global in­vest­ments into re­new­able en­ergy un­til 2050, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg New En­ergy Fi­nance.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, green en­ergy jobs, par­tic­u­larly around so­lar, have the po­ten­tial to grow quickly.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment re­cently up­graded the so­lar ca­pac­ity tar­get to 1.5 gi­gawatt-peak (GWp) by 2025 – equiv­a­lent to pow­er­ing about 260,000 house­holds a year – and 2 GWp by 2030.</p>
    <p>Mr Frank Phuan, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of lo­cal so­lar en­ergy firm Sun­seap, which in­stalls so­lar power sys­tems on HDB and com­mer­cial rooftops, says this chal­lenge can be met but re­quires ma­jor scal­ing up – and find­ing the right peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“There is an es­ti­mate that for ev­ery 100 megawatts of so­lar that we in­stall, it is roughly equiv­a­lent to 200 jobs. So, what the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced – 1.5GWp – would lead to roughly 3,000 to 4,000 jobs. Now, (the ques­tion) is whether the lo­cals are will­ing to take them on,” he tells In­sight.</p>
    <p>Up till now, Sun­seap has hired for­eign work­ers as in­stall­ers but the pan­demic has de­railed that. So, it is now look­ing to em­ploy 300 Sin­ga­pore­ans as so­lar in­stall­ers, or tech­ni­cians – with ba­sic an­nual salaries from $25,000 to $30,000 or more with per­for­mance bonuses.</p>
    <p>“If we crack this man­power is­sue and we are suc­cess­ful in hir­ing these 300 peo­ple, hope­fully more will join. If we have thou­sands of peo­ple will­ing to take up these jobs, we will have mo­men­tum to scale,” he says.</p>
    <p>Sun­seap is also en­ter­ing the elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) charg­ing mar­ket lo­cally and is ex­pand­ing into the re­gion to build re­new­able en­ergy projects. The aim is to cre­ate a core Sin­ga­porean project man­age­ment team that can work over­seas.</p>
    <p>Mr Phuan also sees huge po­ten­tial in retrofitti­ng build­ings in Sin­ga­pore to make them more en­ergy ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>“There will be a lot more tasks and jobs be­ing cre­ated in the clean en­ergy sec­tor from so­lar, from en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, from in­stalling EV charg­ing and bat­tery sys­tems. So the 300 peo­ple trained for so­lar can also be trained in these other seg­ments.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could also be­come a re­gional clean en­ergy train­ing and job hub, says Mr An­drew Af­fleck, man­ag­ing part­ner and founder of Arm­strong As­set Man­age­ment, a Sin­ga­pore-based green en­ergy pri­vate eq­uity firm.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore should be a key ben­e­fi­ciary of the new green econ­omy tal­ent pool. As a re­gional hub, there are many in­ter­na­tional busi­nesses which have, or are in the process of es­tab­lish­ing, a re­gional hub in Sin­ga­pore,” says Mr Af­fleck, whose firm has de­vel­oped wind and so­lar projects in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Global pen­sion funds, in­sur­ance com­pa­nies and sov­er­eign wealth groups were also look­ing to in­vest, lured by Asean’s huge ap­petite for en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Pres­sure is grow­ing on gov­ern­ments to adopt stronger cli­mate poli­cies that cut emis­sions from fos­sil fu­els. That is mak­ing cheaper re­new­ables more at­trac­tive, es­pe­cially since big in­vestors are also fac­ing pres­sure to stop back­ing fos­sil fuel en­ergy.</p>
    <p>So that means there is a large pool of money ready to in­vest, es­pe­cially with the right pol­icy sig­nals from gov­ern­ments, Mr Af­fleck tells In­sight.</p>
    <p>South Korea pro­vides an ex­am­ple. In July, Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in un­veiled the Korean New Deal, a US$135 bil­lion (S$181.7 bil­lion) in­vest­ment in green and dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy, such as smart grids, as part of a pan­demic re­cov­ery plan.</p>
    <p>It calls for an ex­pan­sion of so­lar pan­els and wind tur­bines to 42.7 gi­gawatts (GW) in 2025, up from 12.7GW last year. The gov­ern­ment will also in­stall so­lar pan­els on 225,000 pub­lic build­ings.</p>
    <p>The green new deal also sets a tar­get of 1.13 mil­lion EVs and 200,000 hy­dro­gen-pow­ered fu­el­cell EVs on Korean roads by 2025.</p>
