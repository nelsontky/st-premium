    <p>Amid a slew of food and bev­er­age ca­su­al­ties claimed by the Covid-19 pan­demic, at least five Ja­panese restau­rants have sprouted in the last three months.</p>
    <p>They range f rom fine-din­ing sushiyas to family-style eater­ies. For most, plans to open were hatched be­fore the cri­sis and their own­ers de­cided to go ahead rather than wait it out.</p>
    <p>And they are bank­ing on Sin­ga­pore­ans’ in­sa­tiable ap­petite for Ja­panese food. In­deed, some re­port they are do­ing very well, with wait­ing lists of up to a month.</p>
    <p>Sushi Kenji in Cup­page Plaza, for ex­am­ple, is booked up till the end of next month. It took over the space va­cated by Ginza Yoshino Sushi in July.</p>
    <p>The eight-seater is a solo ven­ture by chef Kenji Nak­a­gawa, who came to Sin­ga­pore in 2013 to join the first Hashida Sushi in Man­darin Gallery, which closed in 2018.</p>
    <p>He was last at Sushi Jiro in the former Ma­rina Man­darin ho­tel, which has been re­branded as Parkroyal Col­lec­tion Ma­rina Bay and is now closed for ren­o­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The chef says the idea to open his own joint “was a case of tim­ing and op­por­tu­nity”. He adds: “It is an ideal space and the right pace for me to start.”</p>
    <p>At his new eatery, he of­fers only two menus – one is priced at $88 for pri­mar­ily sushi and the other at $128 for five types of sashimi and eight pieces of sushi.</p>
    <p>This is con­sid­ered a steal com­pared with the prices at the restau­rants he used to work at.</p>
    <p>Hashida Sushi, for in­stance, charged up to $500 a per­son for its omakase menu.</p>
    <p>Sushi Kenji’s more ac­ces­si­ble prices may ex­plain why it is full ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Lower prices and a loyal fol­low­ing are also why chef Ken­jiro “Hatch” Hashida’s new pop-up is pack­ing them in.</p>
    <p>Af­ter part­ing ways in May with his epony­mous restau­rant in Mo­hamed Sul­tan Road that was owned by lifestyle group Lifebrandz, he formed a new part­ner­ship with real es­tate de­vel­oper OUE to open a restau­rant in Amoy Street by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, he is rent­ing the OUE So­cial Kitchen space in Down­town Gallery in Shen­ton Way to run a tem­po­rary eatery called Hashida Pri­vate Din­ing. It has two coun­ters that seat six peo­ple each.</p>
    <p>There are two choices for din­ner – a $250 tast­ing menu and an omakase one that starts from $300. Lunch will start next month with $120, $200 and $300 op­tions.</p>
    <p>The chef says he had not in­tended to of­fer the most ex­pen­sive omakase menu for lunch, but changed his mind af­ter re­quests from din­ers.</p>
    <p>The tast­ing menu is an ex­ten­sive one, with ap­pe­tis­ers, cooked dishes, eight pieces of sushi, soup and dessert. It also in­cludes chef Hashida’s sig­na­ture otoro sushi – he slices the tuna belly from a huge slab in front of din­ers.</p>
    <p>There is no web­site and reser­va­tions are only through What­sApp and In­sta­gram Di­rect Message, but the place is al­ready 80 per cent booked for both lunch and din­ner next month.</p>
    <p>Nishikane in Stan­ley Street is also filling up. Its menu com­prises in­gre­di­ents pop­u­lar with Sin­ga­pore­ans, like abalone, wagyu, uni, otoro and truf­fles.</p>
    <p>It has made a splash on so­cial me­dia by fea­tur­ing a bam­boo-han­dle Gucci bag crammed with black truf­fles, placed promi­nently on the counter.</p>
    <p>Opened last month, the restau­rant is helmed by owner-chef Nobuhiro Nishi, who came here 21/</p>
    <p>2 years ago to work in Kappo Shun­sui in Cup­page Plaza.</p>
    <p>Din­ers may baulk at his $220 and $320 menus, but they are priced to at­tract a clien­tele who see value in the mul­ti­ple cour­ses fea­tur­ing pre­mium in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>The sig­na­ture dish, for ex­am­ple, com­prises chunky pieces of sim­mered abalone topped with shrimp and uni.</p>
    <p>For an ad­di­tional charge, you can add a scoop of caviar.</p>
    <p>Dessert is a tray of good­ies, bor­rowed from fine-din­ing Western restau­rants’ trol­ley con­cept.</p>
    <p>Din­ers can pick what­ever they want from lit­tle serv­ings of fruit and pas­tries like cheese­cake and a mon­aka sand­wich of sea salt ice cream.</p>
    <p>The most pricey restau­rant among the new­com­ers is Sushi Kou in Hol­i­day Inn Sin­ga­pore Or­chard City Cen­tre, where lunch and din­ner fea­ture the same $380 and $450 menus.</p>
    <p>Per­haps chef Yoshio Sakuta is count­ing on his fan fol­low­ing from the two-Miche­lin-starred Shouk­ouwa Sushi i n One Fuller­ton, where he was head chef.</p>
    <p>The eight-seater fine-din­ing restau­rant did not re­spond to queries about how well it is do­ing, but it faces chal­lenges in its lo­ca­tion – the Cave­nagh Road ho­tel is still closed. Din­ers have to park i n nearby build­ings and enter through the back.</p>
    <p>On the other end of the scale is Kiyoshi, a family restau­rant i n Amoy Street that opened dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker in April by of­fer­ing take­aways and de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Its full menu is now avail­able for dine-in, with items like maki and yak­i­tori at friendly prices, such as $2 for a stick of chicken yak­i­tori and $12.80 for a salmon men­tai roll.</p>
    <p>What makes the 80-seater stand out from other mid-priced eater­ies is its Tem Chi­rashi Udon ($16.80), which has as­sorted tem­pura piled on cold Inaniwa udon in­stead of hot rice.</p>
    <p>Other than Sin­ga­pore­ans’ love for Ja­panese cui­sine, Nishikane’s man­ag­ing part­ner Ray­mond Lim also points out: “With travel to Ja­pan now im­pos­si­ble, many peo­ple are spend­ing their hol­i­day bud­get on restau­rants here in­stead.”</p>
