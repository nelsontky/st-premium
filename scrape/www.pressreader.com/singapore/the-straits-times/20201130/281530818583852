    <p>•</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES There will be – there al­ready has been – much rend­ing of gar­ments in the box­ing world about whether an ex­hi­bi­tion card head­lined by two men in their 50s and a for­mer Na­tional Bas­ket­ball Associatio­n player fight­ing a YouTube star is good or bad for the sport.</p>
    <p>The fight card on Satur­day night at Sta­ples Cen­tre in Los An­ge­les, was, how­ever, un­de­ni­ably fun.</p>
    <p>There were some real fights, and some less real fights.</p>
    <p>Mike Tyson, even at 54, showed he still has some of that speed and power that made him such a dev­as­tat­ing fighter.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen years af­ter re­tir­ing with a 2005 loss to jour­ney­man Kevin McBride, the for­mer heavy­weight cham­pion, once known as the “bad­dest man on the planet”, made his come­back in a closed-door, payper-view match-up against Roy Jones Jr that mixed cu­rios­ity and nos­tal­gia.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia State Ath­letic Com­mis­sion of­fi­cials re­quired two-minute rounds in­stead of the usual three­minute ones, and man­dated larger than nor­mal 12oz (340g) gloves.</p>
    <p>It also said nei­ther fighter could seek a knock­out and de­clared there could be no of­fi­cial win­ner in safety moves for the over-50 fight­ers, but Tyson was the dom­i­nant fighter even though he ap­plauded the draw re­sult af­ter eight rounds.</p>
    <p>“Some­times that two min­utes felt like three min­utes,” the Amer­i­can, who lost 45kg for the fight, said. “I’m glad I got this un­der my belt and I’m look­ing for­ward to doing it again.</p>
    <p>“I was very happy to go the eight rounds. I’m more happy with go­ing the dis­tance. I was afraid I might get hurt.”</p>
    <p>Dana White, pres­i­dent of the Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship, was im­pressed, say­ing he was “blown away” at how good Tyson looked.</p>
    <p>How­ever, fel­low box­ing great Jones was un­happy at the bout be­ing scored a draw even though he looked tired, clinch­ing his op­po­nent for much of the fight.</p>
    <p>“I ain’t never happy with a draw. I don’t do draw,” the 51-year-old said, ad­mit­ting that the body shots he ab­sorbed had worn him down.</p>
    <p>“If he (Tyson) hits you with his head, punches, body shots, it don’t mat­ter, ev­ery­thing hurts,” the Amer­i­can added.</p>
    <p>On the un­der­card, for­mer New York Knicks guard Nate Robin­son was knocked out af­ter YouTube star Jake Paul dropped him three times en route to a sec­ond-round stop­page.</p>
    <p>“I talk a lot of s*** but I back it up,” said the Amer­i­can so­cial me­dia in­flu­encer, who has over 20 mil­lion subscriber­s on YouTube.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old later made his in­ter­viewer laugh af­ter he called out mixed mar­tial arts star and the big­gest name in the UFC, Conor McGre­gor, vow­ing to knock him out.</p>
    <p>“I want to be in the sport for a long time. I’m in love with it. Why not?” said Paul, who is known for his skits and pranks. “I’m just get­ting started.”</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia was equally abuzz over rap­per Snoop Dogg, who per­formed a num­ber of his hits while smok­ing mar­i­juana be­fore join­ing the com­men­tary crew.</p>
    <p>Even US con­gress­woman Il­han Omar weighed in on the over-thetop ex­trav­a­ganza, tweet­ing “this is more of a hip-hop show than a box­ing show”.</p>
