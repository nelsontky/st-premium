    <p>BEI­JING • Chi­nese tourists, mil­lions of whom have shunned over­seas travel be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, are lim­it­ing their jour­neys fur­ther to nearby cities and avoid­ing leav­ing their prov­inces.</p>
    <p>Re­cent Covid-19 cases in Bei­jing and north­ern China have rekin­dled public con­cern, al­ready shaken by calls to avoid non-es­sen­tial travel dur­ing the fes­tive sea­son be­tween to­mor­row and the start of Chi­nese New Year in mid-Fe­bru­ary. Mil­lions of do­mes­tic tourists typ­i­cally travel in the week be­fore and after Jan 1.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel book­ings for the three-day New Year week­end had reached 1.8 times of book­ings a year ear­lier as at Dec 24, but most peo­ple were not trav­el­ling far, though plane tick­ets were nearly 20 per cent cheaper on av­er­age, Bei­jing-based on­line travel plat­form Qu­nar.com said.</p>
    <p>“The trend is to take a train to visit cities within the reach of one hour,” the com­pany said, adding that the hottest train tick­ets are for trips be­tween Chengdu and Chongqing, Guangzhou and Shen­zhen, and Shang­hai and Hangzhou.</p>
    <p>Around 34 mil­lion peo­ple will travel by train be­tween to­day and Sun­day, or 8.5 mil­lion peo­ple per day, down 6.9 per cent from a year ear­lier, a China Rail­way of­fi­cial told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Huang Li, a white-col­lar worker in Bei­jing, said she de­cided against go­ing to Sanya in Hainan prov­ince after the govern­ment told peo­ple to avoid un­nec­es­sary travel.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sure if my son would be al­lowed to at­tend classes in his kinder­garten if we leave Bei­jing,” said Ms Huang, 40. “Too many un­cer­tain­ties.”</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese cap­i­tal has can­celled large-scale events and or­dered travel agen­cies not to sell pack­ages for the city dur­ing the New Year and Chi­nese New Year hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Other cities have fol­lowed suit. Shen­zhen and Dalian have told res­i­dents not to leave “un­less nec­es­sary”. In Hubei prov­ince, where the pan­demic be­gan, lo­cals were told to stay in­doors and cap fam­ily gath­er­ings at 10 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ms Zhou Wei­hong, deputy gen­eral man­ager at Spring Tour, the travel arm of Shang­hai-based Spring Group, said her agency had de­vel­oped of­fer­ings aimed at lo­cal tourism.</p>
    <p>“Around Shang­hai, there are many splen­did things peo­ple can do, and there are great ho­tels and hot springs,” Ms Zhou said.</p>
    <p>But not all trav­ellers are can­celling longer trips. Bei­jing res­i­dent Cai Dong, 34, and his wife are fly­ing to Sanya this week. “It isn’t worth ru­in­ing my planned hol­i­day just be­cause of a hand­ful of cases,” Mr Cai said.</p>
