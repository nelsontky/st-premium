    <p>Three weeks af­ter Tai­wanese singer Stella Chang an­nounced her shock di­vorce from her banker hus­band Sung Hsueh-jen, Tai­wanese me­dia re­ported that singer Rachel Liang has also ended her mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Liang, 33, mar­ried evan­ge­list Amos Chang, 31, in 2016 af­ter they had dated for more than two years. They had met at a church event.</p>
    <p>She has posted sev­eral pho­tos with Mr Chang on so­cial me­dia since their mar­riage.</p>
    <p>On April 9, she posted pho­tos of her birth­day cel­e­bra­tion the day be­fore, which was at­tended by sev­eral friends. In one of the pic­tures, her hus­band hugs her from be­hind.</p>
    <p>But in a hint that not all was well, Liang wrote on May 7: “I am sad to­day, but I don’t think any­one can tell.”</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s Ap­ple Daily re­ported that on June 21, Mr Chang con­fessed in front of 500 peo­ple at a church ser­vice that he had “be­trayed” Liang and their mar­riage.</p>
    <p>The singer’s man­ager told Ap­ple Daily that the two have since “parted am­i­ca­bly”, but did not ad­dress the ru­mour of a third party in their mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Liang, the run­ner-up of Tai­wan’s re­al­ity star search tele­vi­sion show One Mil­lion Star in 2008, had said in past me­dia in­ter­views that she could not adapt to mar­riage life ini­tially.</p>
    <p>She had, on oc­ca­sion, moved back to her fam­ily home and even kicked Mr Chang out of the house due to her out­bursts. She said her hus­band would give in to her for the sake of har­mony.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple had planned to have chil­dren, but Liang has had prob­lems con­ceiv­ing as she suf­fers from poly­cys­tic ovary syn­drome.</p>
