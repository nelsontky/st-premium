    <p>Changes to the law on clean­ing stan­dards are ex­pected to be passed in Par­lia­ment next month to help the coun­try deal with Covid-19 and other health risks, said Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She said the amend­ments to the En­vi­ron­men­tal Pub­lic Health Act are part of ef­forts to boost Sin­ga­pore’s re­silience against the cur­rent pan­demic and dengue out­break, as well as fu­ture pub­lic health threats.</p>
    <p>The changes in­clude im­ple­ment­ing manda­tory clean­ing stan­dards, such as a regime spec­i­fy­ing the fre­quency of rou­tine clean­ing and deep clean­ing for dis­in­fec­tion. En­vi­ron­men­tal san­i­ta­tion con­trols will be en­hanced and more ac­count­abil­ity will be re­quired of premise own­ers.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed changes were an­nounced ear­lier this year when Sin­ga­pore was in the early stages of its fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The new rules will be pro­gres­sively im­ple­mented from next year, start­ing with higher-risk sec­tors</p>
    <p>Their con­tri­bu­tions are sig­nif­i­cant but there is an in­her­ent com­pla­cency in Sin­ga­pore­ans who are today over-re­liant on clean­ers to clear up the mess we of­ten leave be­hind. Sin­ga­pore­ans can do more by en­cour­ag­ing a cul­ture of shared re­spon­si­bil­ity and tak­ing strong own­er­ship of clean­li­ness in pub­lic spa­ces.</p>
    <p>with high foot­fall, and ar­eas with vul­ner­a­ble users, such as child­care cen­tres, said Ms Fu, who was speak­ing at a vir­tual launch of the Pub­lic Hy­giene Coun­cil’s (PHC) month-long Keep Clean, Sin­ga­pore cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The an­nual cam­paign en­cour­ages Sin­ga­pore­ans to take own­er­ship of the clean­li­ness of shared pub­lic spa­ces. This year’s event aims to high­light that Sin­ga­pore is in a “war against lit­ter­ing”, by get­ting Sin­ga­pore­ans to recog­nise that lit­ter is not just an aes­thetic prob­lem but also a pub­lic health threat.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu also gave an up­date on the num­ber of premises that have been awarded the SG Clean qual­ity mark, which sig­ni­fies if an op­er­a­tor has met cer­tain hy­giene stan­dards.</p>
    <p>As at the end of last month, more than 22,000 premises have re</p>
    <p>ceived it, she said. “This mark will be im­por­tant to busi­nesses, such as ho­tels and restau­rants, who want to get their cus­tomers back by as­sur­ing them of the mea­sures taken to safe­guard their health.”</p>
    <p>Ms Fu added that en­sur­ing the clean­li­ness of the pub­lic spa­ces “is our shared re­spon­si­bil­ity”. “Be­yond what the Gov­ern­ment and own­ers of premises can do, mem­bers of the pub­lic – that’s us – must help keep Sin­ga­pore clean,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu cited the lat­est Pub­lic Clean­li­ness Sat­is­fac­tion Sur­vey re­leased by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity on Fri­day. About 87 per cent of re­spon­dents ac­knowl­edged that Sin­ga­pore is clean only be­cause of its clean­ing services’ ef­fi­ciency. The sur­vey was based on re­sponses col­lected from last De­cem­ber to April.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the es­sen­tial work of clean­ers was recog­nised by the PHC. Sin­ga­pore’s clean and green im­age is largely the hard work of its army of over 59,000 clean­ers.</p>
    <p>PHC chair­man Ed­ward D’Silva said the clean­ers are “true he­roes” in keep­ing the city clean.</p>
    <p>“Their con­tri­bu­tions are sig­nif­i­cant but there is an in­her­ent com­pla­cency in Sin­ga­pore­ans who are today over-re­liant on clean­ers to clear up the mess we of­ten leave be­hind,” he said. “Sin­ga­pore­ans can do more by en­cour­ag­ing a cul­ture of shared re­spon­si­bil­ity and tak­ing strong own­er­ship of clean­li­ness in pub­lic spa­ces.”</p>
    <p>As part of the cam­paign, the pub­lic is en­cour­aged to con­duct smallscale lit­ter-pick­ing ac­tiv­i­ties – in groups of no more than five peo­ple – at their es­tates, beaches or parks.</p>
    <p>The PHC had orig­i­nally planned to launch SG Clean Day yes­ter­day. It is an is­land­wide ini­tia­tive aimed at ceas­ing pub­lic clean­ing for a day and en­cour­ag­ing residents to par­tic­i­pate in clean-up ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this had to be shelved be­cause of the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Many volunteers across the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, took part in an ini­tia­tive by the Al­liance to End Plas­tic Waste to re­move lit­ter from the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­like past clean-up ef­forts, this two-week All To­gether Global Cleanup cam­paign, which started yes­ter­day, en­cour­ages par­tic­i­pants to take pho­tos of each piece of lit­ter dis­posed and geo-tag the images on a mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion called Lit­terati.</p>
