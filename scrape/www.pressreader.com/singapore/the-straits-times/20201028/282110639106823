    <p>For stu­dents in Mr Karthick­eyen Govin­daraj’s class, lit­er­a­ture lessons go be­yond the text­books. They go out­doors, lit­er­ally.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, when do­ing The Thief And The Dogs, an Egyp­tian novel by No­bel lau­re­ate Naguib Mah­fouz that was trans­lated into English, Mr Karthick­eyen, a lit­er­a­ture teacher at St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion, took his stu­dents on a learn­ing jour­ney to Arab Street.</p>
    <p>He felt that the visit would en­hance his stu­dents’ ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the lit­er­a­ture text and the rich­ness of Egyp­tian cul­ture. From tast­ing Mid­dle East­ern cui­sine to ad­mir­ing vi­brant mo­saic walls, his stu­dents re­lived scenes that the main char­ac­ter in the book ex­pe­ri­enced.</p>
    <p>Mr Karthick­eyen said: “In a glob­alised en­vi­ron­ment, we need to ap­pre­ci­ate the cul­tures of one another. Since food is such an emo­tional process, it gives you the im­pe­tus to want to know more about the cul­ture.”</p>
    <p>He has in the past taken his English and lit­er­a­ture stu­dents to Or­chard Road to study ad­ver­tise­ments to bet­ter un­der­stand how the lan­guage is used in ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Karthick­eyen, 34, was one of seven ed­u­ca­tors to re­ceive the In­spir­ing Teacher of English Award yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The award, now in its 13th year, ac­knowl­edges teach­ers who have been in­stru­men­tal in ig­nit­ing a love for English, English Lit­er­a­ture or Gen­eral Pa­per. It has two cat­e­gories: the Teach­ing Award and the Lead­er­ship Award.</p>
    <p>The Teach­ing Award recog­nises teach­ers who make lessons ex­cit­ing and rel­e­vant to their stu­dents.</p>
    <p>The Lead­er­ship Award ac­knowl­edges heads of depart­ment, sub­ject heads and level heads who have ef­fec­tively ex­e­cuted English lan­guage pro­grammes while work­ing with other teach­ers.</p>
    <p>In his con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sage recorded on video, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said: “A lan­guage that is as dy­namic and ex­pres­sive as English re­quires teach­ers who are pas­sion­ate about their work, and who go about teach­ing the lan­guage in in­no­va­tive and ef­fec­tive ways. We see th­ese traits in all our re­cip­i­ents of this year’s In­spir­ing Teacher of English Award.”</p>
    <p>A vir­tual ses­sion was held to com­mem­o­rate and recog­nise the win­ners yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Another award win­ner is Ms Chen Ying Rhev­erie, whose stu­dents are trained to ask ques­tions in­stead of just an­swer­ing them.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions are con­ducted to en­cour­age stu­dents to ask prob­ing ques­tions. They learn skills such as crit­i­cal think­ing, ne­go­ti­at­ing dif­fer­ences and chal­leng­ing as­sump­tions.</p>
    <p>The Unity Sec­ondary School teacher, 27, said: “One con­cern for me is that when my stu­dents leave the class­room, are they go­ing to take with them knowl­edge that is go­ing to be­come out­dated, or are they go­ing to walk away with some­thing that will still serve them in the fu­ture. Ob­vi­ously, we want it to be the sec­ond case.”</p>
    <p>Madam Re­nee Yuanna Su­laiman, 36, head of depart­ment for English lan­guage at Pung­gol Green Pri­mary School, re­cently or­gan­ised an English Lan­guage Fest – a cel­e­bra­tion of English where stu­dents get the op­por­tu­nity to un­leash their creativ­ity.</p>
    <p>In this year’s mys­tery-themed event, teach­ers played the role of news­cast­ers while stu­dents were tasked with solv­ing rid­dles us­ing English lan­guage skills.</p>
