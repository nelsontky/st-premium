    <p>AL­WAYS A CHANCE</p>
    <p>After the win last week­end, I’m ex­cited to get back on track... It just shows that if you keep push­ing to­wards one goal, then great re­sults are al­ways pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MAX VER­STAP­PEN, Red Bull driver, ended Mercedes’ per­fect start to the sea­son with a win last Sun­day. He is eye­ing his 10th ca­reer win this week­end in Barcelona.</p>
    <p>BARCELONA • Fresh from win­ning last Sun­day’s 70th An­niver­sary race at Sil­ver­stone, Max Ver­stap­pen re­turns to the scene of his maiden For­mula One tri­umph seek­ing to in­ten­sify his ti­tle chal­lenge with the 10th win of his ca­reer at this week­end’s Span­ish Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man was only 18 when, on his de­but with Red Bull, he took full ad­van­tage of a first-lap col­li­sion in­volv­ing both Mercedes driv­ers, to surge to vic­tory in the 2016 race.</p>
    <p>Four years on, the Sil­ver Ar­rows will not only be keen to avoid a sim­i­lar sce­nario to that tor­rid af­ter­noon, but they will also hope that they do not have the same tyre wear and blis­ter­ing prob­lems that af­flicted both Lewis Hamil­ton and Valt­teri Bot­tas last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Tyres are ex­pected, once again, to be a key fac­tor in de­cid­ing the out­come at the Cir­cuit de</p>
    <p>Catalunya, where high tem­per­a­tures may also in­flu­ence the re­sult, no­tably be­cause the race, sched­uled orig­i­nally to take place in May, was pushed back due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Air tem­per­a­tures are fore­cast to be in the high twen­ties, cooler than at swel­ter­ing Sil­ver­stone, but still warmer com­pared to the orig­i­nally sched­uled date.</p>
    <p>To Mercedes’ relief, Pirelli has said it will re­vert to its harder tyre com­pounds, in­stead of the ex­tra­soft tyres used at Sil­ver­stone, where Hamil­ton suf­fered a last-lap punc­ture in one race and strug­gled with se­vere blis­ters in the other.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dif­fer­ent track so let’s see how com­pet­i­tive we are against Mercedes this time and how the tem­per­a­tures im­pact ev­ery­one,” said Ver­stap­pen, who is 30 points be­hind six-time world cham­pion Hamil­ton after five races.</p>
    <p>“The Barcelona track is quite hard on the tyres, so I’m not sure how they will hold out in the heat – there will be a lot of un­knowns as we usu­ally race there ear­lier in the year, but I’m look­ing for­ward to it.</p>
    <p>“After the win last week­end, I’m ex­cited to get back on track. It was a mas­sive team achieve­ment for us and for Honda to win – an amaz­ing re­sult, if a bit un­ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“It just shows that if you keep push­ing to­wards one goal, then great re­sults are al­ways pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Mercedes per­for­mance boss An­drew Shovlin ad­mit­ted the team are an­tic­i­pat­ing an­other dif­fi­cult week­end for the third race in a row.</p>
    <p>“We’d be fool­ish to say that we are not go­ing to see this (tyre) prob­lem again and we are not go­ing to see it in Spain,” he said. “We need to be look­ing at so­lu­tions and if we can make good progress and un­der­stand the na­ture of our prob­lem, then we can get on top of it.</p>
    <p>“But there’s no doubt Spain is go­ing to be tough.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Rac­ing Point yesterday con­firmed their driver Ser­gio Perez had fi­nally tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19, en­abling him to race in Barcelona on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Mex­i­can has been side­lined for the past two races after be­com­ing the first F1 driver to con­tract the virus, with Ger­many’s Nico Hulken­berg act­ing as his stand-in.</p>
