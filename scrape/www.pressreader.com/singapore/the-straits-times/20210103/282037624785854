    <p>TOKYO • I had known Arashi to be huge be­fore I moved to Ja­pan in 2016, but not quite how huge they were.</p>
    <p>I thought they were just another teeny­bop­per sen­sa­tion and was pleas­antly sur­prised by how the five-mem­ber group, which had their de­but on Nov 3, 1999, were es­tab­lished ma­ture artists in di­verse ar­eas – act­ing, host­ing, con­cert man­age­ment and even paint­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­til last Thurs­day, they were om­nipresent, with their own weekly va­ri­ety show and fre­quent com­mer­cial ap­pear­ances. An in­dus­try study last month showed all five Arashi mem­bers tak­ing the top five spots on the list of male celebri­ties be­ing used for com­mer­cials. (And at the time of writ­ing this ar­ti­cle, the song A-RA-SHI (1999), used in ad­ver­tise­ments for a coali­tion of seven com­pa­nies, is stuck in my head.)</p>
    <p>Their de­ci­sion to go on hia­tus made front-page head­lines in Jan­uary 2019. Leader and main vo­cal­ist Satoshi Ohno, 40, who had be­gun to see the group’s suc­cess and en­durance as a poi­soned chal­ice, wanted to “live freely for once, with­out any re­straints”.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers – Sho Saku­rai, 38; Masaki Aiba, 38; Kazu­nari Ni­nomiya, 37; and Jun Mat­sumoto, 37 – saw no way Arashi could con­tinue as a four-man out­fit, and said they would each con­tinue to pur­sue their in­di­vid­ual ca­reers.</p>
    <p>The rise of Arashi co­in­cided with a time when Ja­panese pop cul­ture was on the as­cent. Those of my gen­er­a­tion will re­mem­ber the likes of boy band SMAP (1988 to 2016), tele­vi­sion se­ries Great Teacher Onizuka (1998) and Boys Over Flow­ers (2005), as well as songs like Utada Hikaru’s First Love (1999).</p>
    <p>But Ja­pan ap­pears to have been dwarfed by the main­stream in­ter­na­tional suc­cesses en­joyed by its neigh­bour, South Korea, in re­cent years, de­spite the odd vi­ral hit like co­me­dian Piko­taro’s PPAP (2016), short for Pen-Pineap­ple-Ap­ple-Pen, which peaked at No. 77 on the United States’ Bill­board 100 sin­gles chart.</p>
    <p>South Korea, in com­par­i­son, saw boy band BTS top the Bill­board 100 sin­gles chart with three songs last year. There are other South Korean artists mak­ing waves in mu­sic, like Black­pink, while in film, Bong Joon-ho’s Par­a­site (2019) swept the Best Pic­ture and Best Di­rec­tor Os­cars last year.</p>
    <p>JA­PAN’S HITS AND MISSES</p>
    <p>In 2019, Par­a­site also won the Palme d’Or, the top award at the Cannes Film Fes­ti­val, suc­ceed­ing Sho­plifters (2018) by Ja­panese di­rec­tor Hirokazu Kore-eda.</p>
    <p>Both movies deal with sim­i­lar themes of poverty-stricken fam­i­lies try­ing to eke out a liv­ing, in so­cial com­men­taries on the grow­ing gulf be­tween the haves and the have-nots in each coun­try (though the South Korean movie is way blood­ier and has a darker twist than the other).</p>
    <p>The vic­to­ries could not have been greeted more dif­fer­ently. Par­a­site’s wins were quickly lauded in South Korea, but Sho­plifters’ vic­tory at Cannes was in­stead down­played by then Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, while crit­ics dis­missed it as “anti-Ja­pan”.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Heng Yee Kuang, who stud­ies soft-power is­sues at the Univer­sity of Tokyo’s Grad­u­ate School of Public Pol­icy, thinks it is a huge missed op­por­tu­nity for Ja­pan to fall be­hind pri­mar­ily be­cause of its do­mes­tic fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Un­like the con­fi­dent, so­phis­ti­cated im­age pre­sented by BTS or Black­pink, the pop mu­sic in­dus­try in Ja­pan is less slick and has ar­guably less in­ter­na­tional cross­over ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The likes of AKB48 or ri­vals like No­gizaka46 and Saku­razaka46 are seen as idols who thrive on “en­cour­age­ment” from their fans, play­ing up their sac­cha­rine-sweet im­age for nerdy otaku, a con­cept that is for­eign to any­one not liv­ing in Ja­pan. While this works in Ja­pan, Prof Heng thinks it gains far less trac­tion abroad.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, Ja­pan has been slow on the dig­i­tal up­take, given the huge do­mes­tic mar­ket that has, un­til the Covid-19 pan­demic, been wed­ded to CDs and tele­vi­sion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>With much of it tai­lored for do­mes­tic con­sump­tion, this places Ja­pan at an ob­vi­ous dis­ad­van­tage in vis­i­bil­ity when com­pared with South Korea, whose mu­sic is eas­ily avail­able on stream­ing plat­forms, as are its hit dra­mas, which reg­u­larly fea­ture on the top 10 lists of most-watched pro­grammes on Net­flix in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Not that there is no de­mand over­seas for Ja­panese con­tent. Be­fore the plug was pulled on Ter­race House last year af­ter the un­timely sui­cide of pro­fes­sional wrestler Hana Kimura at the age of 22, the re­al­ity pro­gramme was hugely talked about in the re­gion, in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Net­flix’s new Ja­panese pro­duc­tion – the adapted-from-manga Alice In Border­land – made it into the top 10 lists in more than 40 re­gions and was last month re­newed for a se­cond sea­son.</p>
    <p>Arashi is a rare case that came to em­brace dig­i­tal plat­forms. Its 2019 doc­u­men­tary se­ries, Arashi’s Di­ary: Voy­age, was pro­duced by Net­flix, while its sin­gles were in Novem­ber 2019 put up on Spo­tify.</p>
    <p>Even so, that same year, Arashi’s 64-track great­est hits com­pi­la­tion – 5x20 All The Best!! 1999-2019 – was the world’s best-sell­ing al­bum. It moved 3.3 mil­lion copies – though most likely driven by do­mes­tic de­mand – out­selling Tay­lor Swift’s Lover (3.2 mil­lion) and Map Of The Soul: Per­sona by BTS (2.5 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>WHAT NEXT?</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has catal­ysed the shift to­wards dig­i­tal plat­forms, and Ja­pan is grow­ing aware of the need to catch up.</p>
    <p>What would not be lost on in­dus­try play­ers is the mas­sive role that dig­i­tal plat­forms played in the mega box-of­fice suc­cess of an­i­mated film De­mon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba The Movie: Mu­gen Train.</p>
    <p>Re­leased on Oct 16 last year, and de­spite the global film in­dus­try be­ing em­bat­tled by Covid-19 shut­downs, it raked in 32.68 bil­lion yen (S$419 mil­lion) as at last Mon­day to top Ja­pan’s all-time-gross­ing box-of­fice list. It top­pled Hayao Miyazaki’s Spir­ited Away (2001), which had taken 253 days to chalk up 31.68 bil­lion yen.</p>
    <p>De­mon Slayer, first pub­lished as a manga comic from 2016, was made into an an­i­mated se­ries in 2019 and broad­cast on more than 20 video stream­ing ser­vices, in­clud­ing Net­flix and Hulu. The movie release also co­in­cided with the re­open­ing of cin­e­mas to movie­go­ers, and ben­e­fited from pent-up de­mand.</p>
    <p>“More peo­ple read its orig­i­nal manga and watched its an­i­ma­tion on video stream­ing as they stayed at home longer,” says Mr Mi­nami Ichikawa, manag­ing di­rec­tor of film dis­trib­u­tor Toho, adding that this drove up interest in the film.</p>
    <p>Daito Bunka Univer­sity so­ci­ol­o­gist Yuka Ijima, who stud­ies manga and psy­chol­ogy, also points to how the film’s uni­ver­sal themes of fam­ily and resilience strike a chord with au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>In mu­sic, one of Ja­pan’s largest break­through de­buts last year was nine-mem­ber girl group NiziU.</p>
    <p>What is no­table is that the out­fit was not pro­duced in Ja­pan, but in­stead by South Korean agency JYP En­ter­tain­ment, which has artists like boy bands 2PM and Got7 and girl groups like Twice and Itzy in its sta­ble.</p>
    <p>NiziU’s chirpy de­but sin­gle Make You Happy has drawn more than 200 mil­lion views on YouTube, with the dance moves go­ing vi­ral on TikTok.</p>
    <p>Mr Shun­suke Fu­ji­wara, a 33-year-old in Tokyo, told the Nikkei news­pa­per: “I was drawn into the com­ing-of-age story of or­di­nary girls and their re­fined, high-qual­ity per­for­mance of K-pop stan­dards.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has been pump­ing bil­lions of dol­lars into its Cool Ja­pan scheme to boost Ja­panese soft power that spans the pro­mo­tion of every­thing from games to food, manga, anime and other forms of en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>There is def­i­nitely room for more than one global en­ter­tain­ment pow­er­house in East Asia. Hav­ing seen how well made some Ja­panese pro­duc­tions are, I think Ja­pan would do well to set its sights on build­ing con­tent that will ap­peal both do­mes­ti­cally and to the world – and work on pro­mot­ing them glob­ally.</p>
