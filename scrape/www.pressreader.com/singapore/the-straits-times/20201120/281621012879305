    <p>Six new mem­bers have been ap­pointed to the task force chart­ing Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery post-Covid-19 to bring in new per­spec­tives as the team ex­plores new ar­eas of growth.</p>
    <p>The new­com­ers to the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force (EST), which will now have 23 mem­bers in to­tal, in­clude Ms Jessie Yeo, ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary of the Sin­ga­pore Port Workers Union and hu­man re­source di­rec­tor at the Na­tional Trades Union Congress.</p>
    <p>“The work of the EST is im­por­tant as it will have a di­rect im­pact on our workers and the skills that they will need to thrive in the fu­ture econ­omy,” she said at a press con­fer­ence yesterday, adding that she looks for­ward to build­ing on its work and pro­vid­ing her per­spec­tive on jobs and skills.</p>
    <p>Un­der the task force are seven Al­liances for Ac­tion (AfAs) – in­dus­try-led coali­tions tasked to de­vise ideas and gen­er­ate jobs in ar­eas such as sus­tain­abil­ity, ro­bot­ics and ed­u­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>An­other new ap­pointee, con­ser­va­tion sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy and pol­icy ex­pert Koh Lian Pin, will join the AfA on sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Na­ture-based Cli­mate So­lu­tions at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore said the task force aims to build a sus­tain­abil­ity hub and cre­ate an ecosys­tem for play­ers from dif­fer­ent sec­tors, such as the built en­vi­ron­ment, re­new­able en­ergy, agri­cul­ture, waste man­age­ment and fi­nance.</p>
    <p>“What we hope to achieve is to iden­tify new eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties that could help to build Sin­ga­pore’s cli­mate re­silience and re­source re­silience, as well as to pro­tect and pre­serve our nat­u­ral ecosys­tems,” said Pro­fes­sor Koh.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the ad­di­tions yesterday, the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) said: “They will bring new and di­verse con­tri­bu­tions to the work of the EST, es­pe­cially in ar­eas of op­por­tu­nity that the AfAs are pur­su­ing, such as sus­tain­abil­ity and medtech.”</p>
    <p>The other new­com­ers are Mr Amos Leong, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Uni­vac Group; Mr Andrew Kwan, founder and group man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Com­mon­wealth Cap­i­tal; Dr Azlinda An­war, di­rec­tor of grants and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty ad­min­is­tra­tion and co­or­di­nat­ing di­rec­tor of Te­masek Life Sciences Lab­o­ra­tory; and Dr Fi­dah Al­sagoff, joint head of the En­ter­prise Devel­op­ment Group and head of life sciences at Te­masek In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>The task force, which was an­nounced by MTI in May, had drawn crit­i­cisms that it lacked rep­re­sen­ta­tion in terms of gen­der, mi­nor­ity groups and vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>An open let­ter call­ing for more di­verse rep­re­sen­ta­tion and signed by more than 45 in­di­vid­u­als was sub­mit­ted to the Gov­ern­ment in June.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Desmond Lee, who co-chairs the task force with PSA In­ter­na­tional group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Tan</p>
    <p>Chong Meng, said yesterday that the new mem­bers were added due to their ex­per­tise in new growth ar­eas iden­ti­fied during dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “The growth of the EST is a re­sult of the op­por­tu­ni­ties that we have iden­ti­fied and want to seize. For ex­am­ple, we have</p>
    <p>brought in new mem­bers who will be able to help us drive medtech, to be able to push on our AfA on sus­tain­abil­ity, in par­tic­u­lar on na­ture­based so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>“So, while we hoist on board peo­ple’s sug­ges­tions that the EST needs to be more di­verse, we grow our di­ver­sity in or­der to achieve the out­comes that we seek to achieve.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee noted that the task force op­er­ates un­der the Fu­ture Econ­omy Coun­cil, and that the coun­cil and its sub­com­mit­tees “are di­verse and tri­par­tite in na­ture”.</p>
    <p>The other 15 EST mem­bers are: Mr Cae­sar Sengupta, vice-pres­i­dent of pay­ments and Next Bil­lion Users at Google; Ms Dilys Boey, as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore; Mr Ed­mund Koh, pres­i­dent of UBS Asia Pa­cific of UBS Group and UBS and mem­ber of the UBS group ex­ec­u­tive board; Mr Gan Seow Kee, chair­man and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of ExxonMo­bil Asia Pa­cific; Ms Kwee Wei-Lin, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Ho­tel As­so­ci­a­tion and head of ho­tels for Pon­tiac Land Group; Mr Lee Chee Koon, group CEO of Cap­i­taLand; Mr Lee Seow Hiang, CEO of Changi Air­port Group; Mr Lim Ming Yan, chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion; Dr Loo Choon Yong, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and co-founder of Raf­fles Med­i­cal Group; Mr Peter Ho, CEO of Hope Tech­nik; Mr Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Group; Mr Sunny Vergh­ese, co-founder and group CEO of Olam In­ter­na­tional; Mr Tan Chin Hwee, CEO for Asia Pa­cific at Trafigura; Mr Vincent Chong, pres­i­dent and CEO of ST En­gi­neer­ing; and Mr Ye Gang, co-founder and group chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Sea­group.</p>
