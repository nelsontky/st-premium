    <p>TOKYO • Tokyo is in talks with the Ja­panese govern­ment for the city to be tem­po­rar­ily re­moved from a na­tion­wide travel sub­sidy pro­gramme, Asahi Shim­bun re­ported.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike told re­porters she dis­cussed the is­sue with Econ­omy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment wants Ms Koike to tem­po­rar­ily stop peo­ple from vis­it­ing the city un­der the pro­gramme, and is ask­ing Tokyo to en­cour­age res­i­dents to hold off travel to other parts of Ja­pan, the news­pa­per said, cit­ing a govern­ment of­fi­cial fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s Cabi­net has seen its ap­proval rat­ing drop to 40 per cent be­cause of dis­sat­is­fac­tion with the way the govern­ment has han­dled the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, ac­cord­ing to a Mainichi Shim­bun opin­ion poll con­ducted on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said Ja­pan had more than 3,000 new coro­n­avirus cases on Satur­day, which lo­cal me­dia said was a record.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s govern­ment has dou­bled down on its bet that pro­mot­ing do­mes­tic tourism will help shore up the bat­tered econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But ris­ing virus cases in Tokyo and Nagoya mean the govern­ment may halt the “Go To” na­tional travel sub­sidy cam­paign to those cities for now. The govern­ment is con­sid­er­ing sus­pend­ing the two ar­eas from the pro­gramme un­til Dec 25, Fuji Net­work News re­ported.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been dis­cussing the is­sue and mea­sures with gover­nors of cities with ar­eas des­ig­nated stage three,” Mr Nishimura, who is in charge of coro­n­avirus pol­icy, told NHK yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Asked if he was con­sid­er­ing a sus­pen­sion of the travel sub­sidy cam­paign na­tion­wide, Mr Nishimura said he does not think there are risks in re­gions where in­fec­tions have not risen, such as the pre­fec­tures of Shi­mane and Tot­tori.</p>
    <p>Tokyo has al­ready asked peo­ple aged 65 and older and those with un­der­ly­ing health con­di­tions to re­frain from mak­ing trips to or from the cap­i­tal un­der the travel sub­sidy cam­paign un­til Thurs­day.</p>
