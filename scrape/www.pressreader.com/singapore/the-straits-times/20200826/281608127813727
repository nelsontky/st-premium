    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans hit hard by the Covid-19 cri­sis will con­tinue to get sup­port from the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF), which will be re­view­ing and strength­en­ing the coun­try’s so­cial safety nets.</p>
    <p>Sup­port for men­tal and fam­ily well-be­ing will also be boosted, said Min­is­ter Masagos Zulkifli yes­ter­day in his min­istry’s ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also mon­i­tor the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion and con­sider the need to in­tro­duce new sup­port schemes or make struc­tural changes to so­cial poli­cies, the MSF said in re­sponse to queries.</p>
    <p>These are among a raft of mea­sures from the min­istry’s ac­tion plan to help peo­ple cope with the cri­sis and en­sure so­cial mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The cri­sis will not di­vert us from our ef­forts to im­prove so­cial mo­bil­ity,” the min­is­ter said, adding that MSF will dove­tail its ef­forts with those of the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil to train Sin­ga­pore­ans and help them find jobs.</p>
    <p>Schemes to team up groups to ac­tively reach out to those who need sup­port will also be ex­panded, in­clud­ing SG Cares Com­mu­nity Net­works and Com­mu­nity Link ini­tia­tives that serve lower-in­come house­holds.</p>
    <p>“This has be­come es­pe­cially im­por­tant, as Covid-19 has ex­ac­er­bated the chal­lenges faced by vulnerable seg­ments of our so­ci­ety who have less re­sources to buf­fer against the im­pact,” said Mr Masagos.</p>
    <p>The MSF’s agenda in­cludes: reach­ing out to peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and their care­givers; en­cour­ag­ing fam­ily-friendly prac­tices such as flex­i­ble work and work-fromhome ar­range­ments; and adopt­ing a more pre­ven­tive ap­proach and bet­ter re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive meth­ods to help youth at risk and of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that ev­ery child can start off on the same foot­ing, KidS­tart will be ex­panded to ben­e­fit more chil­dren.</p>
    <p>This is a pro­gramme for dis­ad­van­taged chil­dren that pro­vides ad­vice and sup­port to fam­i­lies in ar­eas such as child devel­op­ment and par­ent-child in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The MSF’s ef­forts to tackle in­equal­ity will be aug­mented by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE), which also re­leased its ad­den­dum yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“With Covid-19’s dis­pro­por­tion­ate im­pact on the dis­ad­van­taged, we are re­dou­bling our ef­forts to make sure no child is left be­hind,” Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said.</p>
    <p>Part­ner­ships un­der the MOE’s Up­lift ini­tia­tive, which sees schools and the com­mu­nity work­ing to­gether to sup­port stu­dents from dis­ad­van­taged fam­i­lies, will be deep­ened to fur­ther help stu­dents.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, new op­por­tu­ni­ties will be cre­ated for stu­dents of dif­fer­ent back­grounds to in­ter­act and build bonds with one an­other, such as through co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>With blended learn­ing – mix­ing class­room lessons with on­line lessons – be­com­ing an in­te­gral fea­ture of the cur­ricu­lum from next year, all sec­ondary school stu­dents will get per­sonal dig­i­tal learn­ing de­vices by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>The MOE will also con­tinue to shift away from an aca­demic-fo­cused ap­proach, by pour­ing more re­sources into help­ing stu­dents develop holis­ti­cally, and help­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­quire skills.</p>
    <p>Ap­ti­tude-based ad­mis­sions at the six au­ton­o­mous uni­ver­si­ties will be widened, and more com­mon en­try pro­grammes in­tro­duced in poly­tech­nics and uni­ver­si­ties so that stu­dents have more time to de­cide on their aca­demic spe­cial­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>More sub­sidised train­ing path­ways will also be opened for In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion grad­u­ates and work­ing adults.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents can also get more sup­port with a boost in the num­ber of coun­sel­lors, al­lied ed­u­ca­tors and teach­ers. Teach­ers’ skills in work­ing with stu­dents with spe­cial needs will be im­proved, too.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Wong: “In the midst of cri­sis, we are seiz­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to re­shape our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem for the longer term, and to ac­cel­er­ate im­prove­ments in the way we teach and learn.”</p>
    <p>HELP­ING THE VULNERABLE</p>
    <p>This has be­come es­pe­cially im­por­tant, as Covid-19 has ex­ac­er­bated the chal­lenges faced by vulnerable seg­ments of our so­ci­ety who have less re­sources to buf­fer against the im­pact.</p>
