    <p>Six peo­ple who have spent 2020 tire­lessly seek­ing a way out of the great­est cri­sis of our era have been named The Straits Times Asians of the Year.</p>
    <p>Be­tween them, the re­cip­i­ents of the 2020 award cap­ture the en­tire tra­jec­tory of the re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They are Chi­nese re­searcher Zhang Yongzhen, who led the team that mapped and pub­lished on­line the first com­plete genome of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that sparked the pan­demic; three sci­en­tists – China’s Ma­jor-Gen­eral Chen Wei, Ja­pan’s Dr Ryuichi Morishita and Sin­ga­pore’s Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong – who are among those at the fore­front of de­vel­op­ing vac­cines against the virus; and two busi­ness­men – South Korea’s Mr Seo Jung-jin and In­dia’s Mr Adar Poon­awalla – whose com­pa­nies will en­able the mak­ing and dis­pens­ing of the vac­cines and other Covid-19 treat­ments to the world.</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tively re­ferred to as “the virus busters”, they are he­roes of a kind, hav­ing de­voted them­selves to the press­ing cause of re­solv­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, each in their own ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>“Sars-CoV-2, the virus that has brought death and hard­ship to the world’s largest and most pop­u­lous con­ti­nent, is meet­ing its tamer in The Virus Busters,” the award ci­ta­tion said. “We salute your courage, care, com­mit­ment and cre­ativ­ity. In this peril-filled hour, you are a sym­bol of hope for Asia, in­deed the world.”</p>
    <p>In de­cid­ing to hon­our The Virus Busters, ST edi­tors had in mind those who have, in one way or an­other, en­abled the com­plex, mul­ti­stage process of pre­vent­ing as many peo­ple around the world from get­ting the deadly dis­ease in as lit­tle time as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Said Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, editor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group and editor of ST: “Each year, ST edi­tors seek out a per­son, team or or­gan­i­sa­tion that has not only made or shaped the news, but also helped con­trib­ute pos­i­tively to Asia in the process.</p>
    <p>“This year, we nat­u­rally looked to those in­volved in the fight against Covid-19, which has dom­i­nated the head­lines. We de­bated long and hard, but fi­nally agreed on a group of peo­ple who have done the most to help find an an­swer to the cri­sis brought on by the virus.</p>
    <p>“They are a dis­parate group whose col­lec­tive ef­forts have pushed for­ward the search for vac­cines, al­low­ing these to be dis­cov­ered and de­liv­ered with an ur­gency never at­tempted or seen be­fore. Their com­mit­ment and ac­tions have helped save lives and give hope to peo­ple all around Asia, and the world.”</p>
    <p>WORK­ING TO END PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Zhang Yongzhen, 55, of China’s Shang­hai Pub­lic Health Clin­i­cal Cen­tre helped kick-start the process of work­ing to­wards an end to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He and his team toiled through two straight nights in early Jan­uary – af­ter re­ceiv­ing their first sam­ple of the mys­te­ri­ous ill­ness then plagu­ing the city of Wuhan in cen­tral Hubei province – to map the first com­plete genome of the virus.</p>
    <p>With the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of the pathogen came the re­al­i­sa­tion of the enor­mity of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Zhang’s team quickly shared their find­ings with the au­thor­i­ties and posted the in­for­ma­tion on­line to alert the global sci­en­tific com­mu­nity of the dan­ger­ous virus about to sweep the world.</p>
    <p>It would have taken ex­tra­or­di­nary gump­tion to do so, as some whis­tle-blow­ing doc­tors who had ear­lier tried to sound the alarm about the dis­ease had been de­tained at that time. Prof Zhang and his team’s timely trans­parency proved vi­tal in the swift de­vel­op­ment of test­ing kits and early re­search into treat­ments and vac­cines for the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Over in Wuhan, the Chi­nese mil­i­tary’s top epi­demi­ol­o­gist Chen Wei, 54, scram­bled to de­velop a vi­able vac­cine to bring an end to the out­break that she could al­ready fore­see wreak­ing havoc across the globe.</p>
    <p>In barely 50 days, she and her team had pro­duced a po­ten­tial vac­cine with Chi­nese firm CanSino Bi­o­log­ics ready for clin­i­cal tri­als. It be­came the world’s first vac­cine to be ap­proved for re­stricted use.</p>
    <p>While Maj-Gen Chen’s vac­cine em­ployed a tried-and-tested method of us­ing a com­mon cold virus to carry ge­netic data of the coro­n­avirus’ pro­tein to elicit an im­mune re­sponse, other re­searchers are blaz­ing a trail in ex­per­i­ment­ing with novel tech­nolo­gies in de­vel­op­ing their own vac­cines.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, Dr Ryuichi Morishita, 58, a pro­fes­sor of clin­i­cal gene ther­apy at Osaka Univer­sity, is work­ing with home-grown biotech start-up AnGes on a DNA vac­cine, while Sin­ga­pore’s Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, 53, is lead­ing sci­en­tists at the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics to de­velop a mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA) vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The DNA and mRNA vac­cines dif­fer from tra­di­tional ones in that, in­stead of in­ject­ing a form of a virus into the body, they take only a small part of the coro­n­avirus’ ge­netic data to stim­u­late cells to cre­ate a pro­tein that would pro­duce an­ti­bod­ies against the virus.</p>
    <p>If the DNA and mRNA Covid-19 vac­cines make it through the clin­i­cal tri­als and are ap­proved for use in hu­mans, they will be among the very first of their kind.</p>
    <p>The first such mRNA vac­cine, an Amer­i­can-Ger­man col­lab­o­ra­tion by drug-mak­ers Pfizer and BioNTech, was ap­proved for mass pro­duc­tion only on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>These novel tech­nolo­gies can be de­vel­oped quickly, and may churn out vac­cines that are cheaper to pro­duce.</p>
    <p>The Asian ef­forts are but part of a wider, global col­lab­o­ra­tion. De­vel­op­ers in the United States and Europe, too, have been work­ing at light­ning speed to crunch down the typ­i­cal years taken to cre­ate a vac­cine to just months.</p>
    <p>There are promis­ing vac­cine can­di­dates from Rus­sia and China as well, though they have been less</p>
