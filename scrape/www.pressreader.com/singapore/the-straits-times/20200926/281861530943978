    <p>Malaysian politi­cian An­war Ibrahim’s bid to helm the coun­try re­mains in limbo, af­ter the Palace an­nounced yes­ter­day that the King would not be grant­ing any­one an au­di­ence for a week.</p>
    <p>“His Majesty has been ad­vised by his doc­tors to re­main at (hos­pi­tal) for seven days for ob­ser­va­tion. So un­til then, he will not have any meet­ings,” palace comptrolle­r Ah­mad Fadil Sham­sud­din was quoted as say­ing by Reuters.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that he had se­cured a “for­mi­da­ble” ma­jor­ity of law­mak­ers in Par­lia­ment to oust Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, but needs to con­vince the King that he has the num­bers to form a gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion, the King can ap­point a prime min­is­ter whom he sees as likely to com­mand a ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He can also dis­solve Par­lia­ment and call for elec­tions on the cur­rent prime min­is­ter’s ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war was sched­uled to meet the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, on Tues­day, but the meet­ing was post­poned af­ter the ruler was ad­mit­ted to the Na­tional Heart In­sti­tute for an undis­closed ail­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Tan Sri Muhyid­din, whose Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact has been gov­ern­ing since March with a ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity in the Lower House, re­it­er­ated that he re­mains Prime Min­is­ter and con­tin­ued to cast doubt on how much sup­port Mr An­war has gar­nered.</p>
    <p>“So far, I haven’t been sum­moned (by the King) so I don’t need to re­act hastily to such things,” he said yes­ter­day at a cam­paign rally in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din said he had raised the mat­ter with At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Idrus Harun, who con­firmed that he was still Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s back­ers are said to in­clude sev­eral law­mak­ers from Umno, the largest party in PN.</p>
    <p>Umno’s ally, Parti Is­lam Se-Malaysia (PAS), which is also part of the PN gov­ern­ment, yes­ter­day sought clar­i­fi­ca­tion on th­ese claims. It said if the claims were true, then Umno, its part­ner in their Muafakat Na­sional pact, had breached their agree­ment to unite Mus­lims in the coun­try and de­feat Pakatan Hara­pan, the op­po­si­tion coali­tion led by Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>“If the move is real, it could be seen as a plan to top­ple the Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment,”</p>
    <p>PAS sec­re­tary-gen­eral Takiyud­din Has­san said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“PAS hopes to get a clear ex­pla­na­tion from Umno,” he added.</p>
    <p>A list of Umno MPs al­legedly sup­port­ing Mr An­war had made its rounds on so­cial me­dia, but the law­mak­ers in ques­tion have de­nied that they are jump­ing ship.</p>
    <p>At present, Mr Muhyid­din’s PN coali­tion, hastily cob­bled to­gether dur­ing a coup in Fe­bru­ary, rules</p>
    <p>with a ma­jor­ity of just 113 seats in the 222-seat Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat yes­ter­day de­manded that Mr Muhyid­din step down.</p>
    <p>“Tan Sri Muhyid­din should re­spect­fully step down and re­sign as Malaysia’s prime min­is­ter, see­ing that the ma­jor­ity sup­port of MPs has now shifted to An­war Ibrahim,” PKR in­for­ma­tion chief Sham­sul Iskan­dar Mohd Akin said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while Tan Sri An­nuar Musa, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional al­liance, said yes­ter­day that Mr An­war was be­ing ma­nip­u­lated to trig­ger a snap elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve (An­war) has been made into bait, to has­ten the gen­eral elec­tion. Noth­ing more than that. That’s what we call pol­i­tics,” he posted on Twit­ter.</p>
