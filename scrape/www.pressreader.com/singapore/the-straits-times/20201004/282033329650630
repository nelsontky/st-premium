    <p>The Euro­pean Union’s de­ci­sion to launch le­gal pro­ceed­ings which may end up drag­ging Bri­tain through the courts be­cause of London’s plans to vi­o­late ex­ist­ing Euro­pean treaties could not have come at a worse time.</p>
    <p>For not only are the trade talks be­tween Bri­tain and the EU dead­locked with less than three months be­fore bor­der con­trols and Cus­toms checks go up with the rest of Europe, but the idea that the Bri­tish could still end up in the Euro­pean docks de­spite the fact that their coun­try has for­mally left the EU has en­raged na­tion­al­ists in London.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to take our own mea­sures in our own way to safe­guard the whole of the United King­dom,” vowed se­nior Bri­tish gov­ern­ment min­is­ter Michael Gove, soon after the EU de­ci­sion to start le­gal pro­ceed­ings was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>But, para­dox­i­cally, ris­ing bad feel­ings on both sides of the</p>
    <p>English Chan­nel could well be a pre­lude to a po­ten­tial com­pro­mise. For in the com­pli­cated world of Euro­pean pol­i­tics, not ev­ery­thing is as it seems.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain ceased to be a mem­ber of the EU at the end of Jan­uary, based on a treaty which spec­i­fies its fu­ture re­la­tions with the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>One of the key as­pects of that treaty was the ques­tion of North­ern Ire­land, which re­mains part of the UK but shares a bor­der with</p>
    <p>Ire­land, which re­mains a mem­ber of the EU.</p>
    <p>As part of the 1998 so-called Good Fri­day Agree­ment, which ended decades of blood­shed be­tween Catholics and Protes­tants in North­ern Ire­land, Bri­tain and Ire­land vowed to make the bor­der be­tween them ir­rel­e­vant, by hav­ing no checks there.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish promised that, de­spite the fact that they are now out­side the EU, the bor­der on the is­land of Ire­land will not re­turn, and the Cus­toms checks which the EU now de­mands from Bri­tain will be done be­tween North­ern Ire­land and the rest of the Bri­tish mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Now, how­ever, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has in­tro­duced draft leg­is­la­tion which gives its min­is­ters pow­ers to sus­pend these Cus­toms con­trols with North­ern Ire­land, in ef­fect forc­ing Ire­land to im­pose Cus­toms con­trols, as it would be re­quired to do as a re­main­ing EU mem­ber.</p>
    <p>And, to make mat­ters worse, min­is­ters in London are breezily ad­mit­ting that this vi­o­lates in­ter­na­tional treaties to which they are sig­na­to­ries.</p>
    <p>This is clearly an af­front which the EU can­not tol­er­ate, if only be­cause the bloc is pledged to stand by Ire­land.</p>
    <p>“We had in­vited our Bri­tish friends to re­move the prob­lem­atic parts of their draft,” said Dr Ur­sula von der Leyen, the pres­i­dent of the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the</p>
    <p>EU’s ex­ec­u­tive body, who set a dead­line of the end of last month for Bri­tain to re­turn to com­pli­ance with its obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>But since there was no Bri­tish re­sponse, le­gal pro­ceed­ings be­came in­evitable.</p>
    <p>Still, what the Com­mis­sion has done is just to launch a so-called process of in­fringe­ment, a rou­tine pro­ce­dure fre­quently em­ployed against EU mem­ber states or those with very close treaty obli­ga­tions with the EU; his­tor­i­cally, France and Ger­many, who oth­er­wise count them­selves as en­thu­si­as­tic EU mem­ber states, have had more in­fringe­ment pro­ce­dures launched against them than</p>
    <p>Bri­tain ever ex­pe­ri­enced.</p>
    <p>The pro­ce­dure is also slow: Bri­tain has un­til the end of this month to ex­plain it­self, the Com­mis­sion will then de­bate what it should do next, ac­tual court pro­ceed­ings may not start for months there­after, and the Euro­pean Court of Justice may not reach a fi­nal de­ci­sion un­til well into the sec­ond half of next year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, all the in­di­ca­tions are that the ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween the EU and Bri­tain over a fu­ture free trade deal look set to con­tinue and, if these are suc­cess­ful, the en­tire dis­pute will be in any case ir­rel­e­vant, since no bor­der con­trols would need to be erected.</p>
    <p>In­deed, it is just pos­si­ble that although the Com­mis­sion and most EU mem­ber states re­main ap­palled by the Bri­tish be­hav­iour, the spat may be just what ev­ery­one needs to get a deal.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, who came to power on an anti-EU plat­form, may be able to present any trade deal he signs up to with Europe as a vic­tory for his tough stance and as the di­rect out­come of his cur­rent con­fronta­tional stance.</p>
    <p>And the EU can also use the cur­rent con­fronta­tion as a cue for a swifter move on the trade ne­go­ti­a­tions, for any deal it con­cludes with the Bri­tish could be pre­sented as one sav­ing Europe from much big­ger po­lit­i­cal trou­ble.</p>
    <p>The snag for both sides is that all this de­pends on the as­sump­tion that, ul­ti­mately, politi­cians in Bri­tain will be guided by rea­son, and by a de­ter­mi­na­tion not to ad­min­is­ter an even big­ger shock on the Bri­tish econ­omy, which is al­ready se­ri­ously hit by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, at least for the moment, deep-seated anti-EU feel­ings ap­pear to be stronger among Bri­tish min­is­ters than ar­gu­ments based on eco­nomic logic.</p>
