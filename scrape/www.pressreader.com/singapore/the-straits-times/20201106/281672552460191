    <p>But even more wor­ri­some than posts shar­ing mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion is the ero­sion of the pub­lic’s trust in the demo­cratic process be­yond this spe­cific elec­tion, said Ms Nina Jankow­icz, a dis­in­for­ma­tion an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON As United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his al­lies flooded so­cial me­dia with false claims of vic­tory and un­sup­ported al­le­ga­tions of voter fraud, dis­in­for­ma­tion re­searchers and so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies are warn­ing about a pro­lif­er­a­tion of dis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>False and un­founded claims on so­cial me­dia have put to the test Sil­i­con Val­ley’s much-touted abil­ity to han­dle elec­tion mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>As bal­lots were still be­ing counted on Wed­nes­day, Mr Trump said he had won, although he had not. He also claimed that Democrats were try­ing to “steal” the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter hid the posts within min­utes. In ad­di­tion to adding a warn­ing la­bel, it lim­ited likes and com­ments, and if users wanted to share it, they had to add their own com­men­tary.</p>
    <p>It also tagged state­ments by Mr Trump’s son Eric and White House Press Sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany that falsely claimed vic­tory in Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>In a tweet, Mr Trump said: “We hereby claim the State of Michi­gan if, in fact, there was a large num­ber of se­cretly dumped bal­lots as has been widely re­ported!”</p>
    <p>The post was marked as mis­lead­ing by Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Twit­ter had also ap­plied a la­bel to a post by Mr Ben Wik­ler, head of the Demo­cratic Party of Wis­con­sin, which as­serted pre­ma­turely that Mr Joe Bi­den had won in the state.</p>
    <p>“Some votes may still need to be counted,” Twit­ter’s la­bel read.</p>
    <p>But it is not clear whether the dis­claimers and fact-checks, which of­ten oc­cur well af­ter posts have been shared many times, are curb­ing the spread of base­less claims.</p>
    <p>“Many are still glued to so­cial me­dia streams hop­ing to glean any new in­for­ma­tion, which makes them likely to encounter mis­in­for­ma­tion,” said Dr Joan Dono­van, the re­search di­rec­tor at Har­vard Univer­sity’s Shoren­stein Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Un­sub­stan­ti­ated al­le­ga­tions that bal­lots for Mr Trump were not counted be­cause vot­ers used Sharpie pens, dubbed “Sharpiegat­e”on so­cial me­dia, were la­belled as false on Face­book but shared hun­dreds of thou­sands of times. The ru­mours prompted more than 100 Trump sup­port­ers, urged on by right-wing Twit­ter fig­ures, to gather in Phoenix on Wed­nes­day and de­mand to be let into an elec­tion build­ing where votes were be­ing counted.</p>
    <p>Even if the dis­claimers are curb­ing the spread of mis­in­for­ma­tion on the plat­forms, they have not stopped other me­dia from am­pli­fy­ing Mr Trump’s com­ments or his claims from hop­ping from one plat­form to an­other.</p>
    <p>On Fox News, Mr Trump’s tweets were read out ver­ba­tim on Wed­nes­day, some­times with­out caveats about their verac­ity.</p>
    <p>But even more wor­ri­some than posts shar­ing mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion is the ero­sion of the pub­lic’s trust in the demo­cratic process be­yond this spe­cific elec­tion, said Ms Nina Jankow­icz, a dis­in­for­ma­tion an­a­lyst at the Wil­son Cen­tre, a non­par­ti­san think-tank.</p>
    <p>“In coun­tries I have worked in where there is a his­tory – and ev­i­dence – of voter fraud, cit­i­zens’ dis­trust in the demo­cratic process lingers long even af­ter sev­eral cy­cles of clean, well-run elec­tions,” Ms Jankow­icz said.</p>
