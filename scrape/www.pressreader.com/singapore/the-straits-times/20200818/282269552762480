    <p>A 17th-cen­tury scis­sor-maker, a com­pany that has made braised chicken since 1616 and a food pro­ducer that has been churn­ing out rice dumplings for nearly 100 years are among Chi­nese brands that re­cently in­di­cated their in­ten­tion to list in China.</p>
    <p>These time-hon­oured busi­nesses, known as zhonghua laoz­i­hao, are try­ing to raise cap­i­tal and carve out a name for them­selves in mod­ern China.</p>
    <p>The zhonghua laoz­i­hao dis­tinc­tion is given by China’s Com­merce Min­istry to sto­ried Chi­nese brands dat­ing from 1956 and ear­lier, and which of­fer prod­ucts or ser­vices with cul­tural or his­tor­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance.</p>
    <p>While 1,128 busi­nesses have earned the ac­co­lade, only about 50 are listed on China’s stock ex­changes. The ma­jor­ity are in the food or tra­di­tional medicine in­dus­tries, and have an av­er­age age of 160 years.</p>
    <p>Over the past few weeks, a fresh batch of old names have sig­nalled their in­ten­tion to join their pub­licly listed peers.</p>
    <p>One of them is scis­sor-maker Zhang Xiao Quan, renowned in the coastal Chi­nese prov­inces of Jiangsu and Zhe­jiang. It said in its stock prospec­tus last month it is hop­ing to raise 455 mil­lion yuan (S$89.8 mil­lion) in its up­com­ing ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO).</p>
    <p>Two other laoz­i­hao busi­nesses have re­cently made sim­i­lar an­nounce­ments regarding IPO plans.</p>
    <p>Dezhou Braised Chicken is from Shan­dong prov­ince. Its spe­cial­ity dates back to the Qing dy­nasty.</p>
    <p>Dumpling-maker Wu Fang Zhai, from Zhe­jiang prov­ince, claims to sell 400 mil­lion dumplings a year.</p>
    <p>Ren­min Uni­ver­sity as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor Wang Peng, who has stud­ied China’s laoz­i­hao busi­nesses, called the cur­rent trend of their list­ing on the stock mar­ket “a fad”.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ex­perts say these brands have their eyes fixed on be­com­ing the next Kwe­i­chow Moutai, maker of Chi­nese grain liquor bai­jiu and the most valuable com­pany listed in the Chi­nese main­land with a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of just over two tril­lion yuan.</p>
    <p>List­ing on stock ex­changes al­lows laoz­i­hao com­pa­nies to boost their in­flu­ence and at­tract more cap­i­tal, said ex­perts. But achiev­ing the stature of Kwe­i­chow Moutai will be an up­hill task for many that face chal­lenges in prod­uct in­no­va­tion and mod­ernising their or­gan­i­sa­tional struc­tures, said Prof Wang.</p>
    <p>“These laoz­i­hao need to adapt to mod­ern times, make good use of the mar­ket and trans­form them­selves dig­i­tally. If they can do these, the road ahead af­ter they go pub­lic will be smoother,” he said.</p>
    <p>While many used to be fam­i­ly­owned busi­nesses run over gen­er­a­tions, they were brought un­der govern­ment con­trol in the 1950s af­ter the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party founded mod­ern China in 1949.</p>
    <p>Many laoz­i­hao have re­mained state-owned since, said Mr Lai Yang, who heads the Bei­jing Jing­shang Cir­cu­la­tion Strat­egy Re­search In­sti­tute. He noted that this poses one of the big­gest chal­lenges for the com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Their or­gan­i­sa­tional struc­tures are dated and re­stric­tive, you have a lack of tal­ent, and there isn’t a lot of in­cen­tive for em­ploy­ees to in­no­vate,” he said.</p>
    <p>He pointed to Goubuli Baozi as a cau­tion­ary ex­am­ple. The Tian­jin­based busi­ness sell­ing stuffed bao delisted from Bei­jing’s start-up­heavy “new third board” in May and was crit­i­cised for sell­ing over­priced bao and fail­ing to in­no­vate.</p>
    <p>Mr Lai added that laoz­i­hao com­pa­nies had gained their rep­u­ta­tion in the past for be­ing trust­wor­thy brands be­cause they con­tin­u­ally in­no­vated to of­fer bet­ter prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“If they con­tinue to of­fer goods and ser­vices that haven’t changed for many decades, they will have no rel­e­vance to peo­ple’s lives and will be­come liv­ing fos­sils,” he said.</p>
