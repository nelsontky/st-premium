    <p>Grow­ing ef­forts to help mid-ca­reer work­ers tran­si­tion into promis­ing new jobs through pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes (PCPs) might have hit a snag last year.</p>
    <p>Data re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power on June 30 showed that the num­ber of PCP place­ments fell from 4,973 in 2018 to 4,450 in 2019.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, the num­ber of place­ments had more than tre­bled since 2016, when there were 1,331 peo­ple placed.</p>
    <p>A spokesman from Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG), the statutory board which de­vel­ops and runs PCPs, said that more than half of the de­cline in place­ments last year was due to a drop in place­ments through re­de­ploy­ment PCPs.</p>
    <p>More of such place­ments had taken place in 2018 as com­pa­nies iden­ti­fied key groups of work­ers at risk of be­ing dis­placed, who were sent for reskilling so they could be re­de­ployed in new roles – bank tell­ers trained to be­come cus­tomer re­la­tion­ship man­agers, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>There are about 100 PCPs now across more than 30 sec­tors. There are three pro­gramme types: Re­de­ploy­ment PCPs reskill work­ers for jobs within their com­pa­nies; place­and-train ones pro­vide a job place­ment and train­ing; while at­tac­hand-train ones pro­vide work at­tach­ments and train­ing but do not guar­an­tee a job at the end.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants’ course fees and salaries or train­ing al­lowances are sub­sidised by the Govern­ment, to help them move into jobs or sec­tors with good ca­reer prospects.</p>
    <p>“PCP place­ment num­bers are gen­er­ally de­pen­dent on sev­eral fac­tors, in­clud­ing hir­ing de­mand, the num­ber of par­tic­i­pat­ing em­ploy­ers and the num­ber of job seek­ers who are will­ing to con­sider mid-ca­reer switches. The dy­namic shifts in the labour mar­ket, es­pe­cially amid the pan­demic, add to the mix,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>She added that WSG adapts or in­tro­duces PCPs in re­sponse to changes such as new job roles be­ing cre­ated or en­hanced, or oth­ers be­com­ing less in de­mand, as the econ­omy re­struc­tures.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment said in May that it will ramp up the PCPs for mid-ca­reerists as part of the 100,000 op­por­tu­ni­ties un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age over the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>It aims to dou­ble the num­ber of mid-ca­reer work­ers who en­ter new jobs through reskilling pro­grammes, which in­clude PCPs, to around 5,500 by 2025.</p>
    <p>Asked about how the Govern­ment plans to in­crease PCP place­ments amid the on­go­ing eco­nomic dif­fi­cul­ties, the WSG spokesman said the agency will con­tinue to work closely with sec­tor agen­cies and in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tions to iden­tify and develop pro­grammes, in­clud­ing those in the at­tach-and­train for­mat in growth ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“We will also be ready to sup­port more com­pa­nies as the econ­omy re­cov­ers”, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral train­ing providers and pro­gramme man­agers said par­tic­i­pa­tion in their PCPs rose last year from 2018. They said they work with em­ploy­ers to iden­tify new roles where pro­grammes are needed to plug skills gaps.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity saw a 12 per cent in­crease in par­tic­i­pants for its PCP for in­ter­na­tional trad­ing ex­ec­u­tives from 2018 to last year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic, which runs seven PCPs, had a 63 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of par­tic­i­pants over that pe­riod. It added three new pro­grammes last year – for sea trans­port pro­fes­sion­als, blockchain ap­pli­ca­tion ju­nior de­vel­op­ers and bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals man­u­fac­tur­ing work­ers.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Polytech­nic, Nanyang Polytech­nic and the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) each started one new PCP this year.</p>
    <p>Out­comes for most pro­gramme par­tic­i­pants ap­pear to be pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told Par­lia­ment in Fe­bru­ary that about nine in 10 PCP par­tic­i­pants re­mained em­ployed two years af­ter place­ment, and about seven in 10 earned higher salaries than be­fore.</p>
    <p>How­ever, reser­va­tions among some em­ploy­ers and work­ers may be hin­der­ing greater take-up for the scheme, say ob­servers.</p>
    <p>NUS se­nior eco­nomics lec­turer Kelvin Seah said dis­placed pro­fes­sion­als may pre­fer to wait through a spell of un­em­ploy­ment, hop­ing to be re-em­ployed in their pre­vi­ous oc­cu­pa­tions, rather than quickly start­ing new and un­fa­mil­iar oc­cu­pa­tions.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers may worry that par­tic­i­pants are just us­ing the scheme as a time-filler, hop­ing to even­tu­ally find a job in their pre­vi­ous oc­cu­pa­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers are nat­u­rally con­cerned that the in­vest­ment and train­ing they put into de­vel­op­ing these work­ers will come to nought if they even­tu­ally leave for greener pas­tures,” he said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said that given the cur­rent un­cer­tain eco­nomic climate, work­ers may be ap­pre­hen­sive about tak­ing the plunge into a new ca­reer, and com­pa­nies may also be hold­ing back on ma­jor hir­ing or hav­ing a hir­ing freeze.</p>
    <p>Mer­cer Asean HR leader Chris Spen­dle said at­tach-and-train pro­grammes al­low com­pa­nies to eval­u­ate talent be­fore mak­ing a com­mit­ment. “In the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment, ev­ery dol­lar counts so I ex­pect that many com­pa­nies will utilise at­tac­hand-train pro­grammes as well as re­de­ploy­ment or reskilling be­fore place-and-train,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Emer­lin Toh, man­ag­ing direc­tor of soft­ware con­sul­tancy Reach Tech­nolo­gies, said em­ploy­ers take on some risk when hir­ing trainees via PCPs be­cause some of them may drop out of the course, which means the em­ployer will not be en­ti­tled to claim the salary sub­sidy.</p>
    <p>She has taken on eight trainees since 2018, but two did not com­plete the train­ing. “But it’s still a use­ful scheme to help us hire ex­pe­ri­enced work­ers, be­cause it’s hard to find peo­ple with the right skills in the job mar­ket,” she said.</p>
