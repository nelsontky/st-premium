    <p>Re­tir­ing hawk­ers will be given fi­nan­cial sup­port while they coach new hawk­ers to take over their stalls, said the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) yesterday, in an update on the hawker suc­ces­sion scheme.</p>
    <p>The scheme, which was first an­nounced by NEA last month, matches re­tir­ing hawk­ers with en­trants to the pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>This makes it pos­si­ble for older hawk­ers to teach their recipes to as­pi­rants, as their own fam­ily mem­bers might not be in­ter­ested in con­tin­u­ing the trade.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only hawk­ers who have their rentals sub­sidised can as­sign their stalls to non-rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme, non-sub­sidised hawk­ers will also be al­lowed to do so un­der re­laxed rules.</p>
    <p>NEA said the scheme will be pi­loted in the next two years with just “a hand­ful of vet­eran and as­pir­ing hawk­ers” as close fa­cil­i­ta­tion is re­quired.</p>
    <p>Re­tir­ing hawk­ers will be paid a nom­i­nal stipend for guid­ing those who as­pire to the pro­fes­sion, said NEA, adding that more de­tails will be re­leased at a later date.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme, NEA will as­sess the culi­nary skills of as­pir­ing hawk­ers be­fore pair­ing them with re­tir­ing hawk­ers. The for­mer will then be men­tored for a few months to learn how to run the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>If the as­pir­ing hawk­ers can pass a food tast­ing test as­sessed by NEA, their hawker men­tors, as well as an in­de­pen­dent panel, they can pro­ceed to take over the phys­i­cal hawker stall and its brand name. “As­pir­ing hawk­ers who pass the food tast­ing test will be sub­ject to cer­tain con­di­tions per­tain­ing to the stall’s brand and sig­na­ture dishes for a pe­riod of time, to en­sure that the vet­eran hawker’s legacy is sufficient­ly safe­guarded,” said NEA.</p>
    <p>The agency added that t he scheme is not in­tended to re­place com­mer­cial ar­range­ments, for in­stance, hawk­ers who wish to sell their recipes and brands.</p>
    <p>Mr An­thony Low, vice-pres­i­dent of the Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions, Sin­ga­pore, said older hawk­ers might be sceptical about young hawk­ers be­ing able to pick up the culi­nary skills that they them­selves have spent decades hon­ing, in just a few months.</p>
    <p>“For this to work, the younger hawker must be pas­sion­ate and will­ing to spend more time to learn the craft, and re­tir­ing hawk­ers must be will­ing to share their ex­per­tise,” he said in Mandarin.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh Peng Huat, 59, and his wife Chia Gek Kee, 53, both hawk­ers, said they would be keen to join the suc­ces­sion scheme. Said Ms Chia: “Our grown-up daugh­ters are not so keen to take over our hawker stall. It would be a pity if our recipes and cooking tech­niques were lost when we re­tire.”</p>
    <p>Their fish­ball noo­dle stall in Marine Pa­rade – Nam Kee Teochew 70’s Her­itage Ka­tong – has been around since 1976.</p>
    <p>The hawker suc­ces­sion scheme was in­tro­duced shortly be­fore Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture was of­fi­cially added to the Unesco Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of the In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity on Dec 16. Sin­ga­pore will have to sub­mit a report to Unesco ev­ery six years, show­ing the ef­forts made to safe­guard and trans­mit hawker cul­ture to fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>To cel­e­brate the suc­cess­ful in­scrip­tion, NEA launched SG Hawk­erFest – a se­ries of on­line games and a we­bi­nar – for the pub­lic to learn more about hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>It started yesterday and will run un­til Jan 11. Din­ing vouch­ers in de­nom­i­na­tions of $2 can be won by solv­ing on­line quizzes.</p>
    <p>More de­tails can be found at https://go.gov.sg/sghawk­er­fest</p>
