    <p>TRIB­UTE TO A FRIEND: For­mer Tai­wanese bas­ket­ball star James Mao (above, right) has named his new­born son af­ter his good friend, model-ac­tor God­frey Gao (left), who was slated to be a grooms­man at Mao’s wed­ding to fash­ion stylist Tif­fany Lo (above, left) on Nov 29 last year.</p>
    <p>Gao died at age 35 of sud­den car­diac ar­rest two days be­fore the wed­ding, col­laps­ing dur­ing the film­ing of Chi­nese re­al­ity show Chase Me in Zhe­jiang, China.</p>
    <p>In mem­ory of Gao, Mao ran a short video on the ac­tor and left Gao’s seat at the wed­ding din­ner va­cant.</p>
    <p>In April this year, Mao re­vealed that Lo was preg­nant, and re­counted the highs and lows he had ex­pe­ri­enced in the last six months – from prepar­ing for the wed­ding to los­ing his good friend of 15 years.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the 37-year-old an­nounced on so­cial me­dia that Lo had given birth.</p>
    <p>In the cap­tion of a photo of him hold­ing his baby son’s hand, he wrote in English: “We are so ex­cited and blessed to be able to share the birth of our son, Noah God­frey Mao, on 10/4/2020.”</p>
    <p>Mao thanked Gao’s par­ents for al­low­ing him and Lo to use Gao’s name as their son’s mid­dle name.</p>
    <p>“It is the most mean­ing­ful and hap­pi­est thing for us,” he added in Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>His wife also posted on so­cial me­dia a photo of the baby’s foot, with the cap­tion: “Noah God­frey Mao, we meet fi­nally.”</p>
