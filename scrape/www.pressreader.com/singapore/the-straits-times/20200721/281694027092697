    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment is look­ing at mak­ing it com­pul­sory to wear face masks in pub­lic places, fol­low­ing the dis­cov­ery of 13 new Covid-19 clus­ters this month, Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>De­tails will be an­nounced soon, he said, as he raised con­cerns about the re­laxed at­ti­tude of some Malaysians al­though the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is far from over.</p>
    <p>He said that dur­ing the re­cov­ery move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) pe­riod, every in­di­vid­ual, every fam­ily and every com­mu­nity is a front­liner.</p>
    <p>“Fam­ily mem­bers and the pub­lic must al­ways ad­vise one an­other.</p>
    <p>“Par­ents must al­ways re­mind their chil­dren to wear face masks when go­ing out and prac­tise so­cial dis­tanc­ing,” he said in a speech broad­cast live on tele­vi­sion and so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din said it is wor­ry­ing that new daily Covid-19 cases have been back to hit­ting dou­bledigit fig­ures since sev­eral days ago.</p>
    <p>“This shouldn’t be taken lightly by all of us. I’m sure you do not want the gov­ern­ment to im­pose a lock­down if there is a spike,” he added.</p>
    <p>The coun­try im­posed the MCO– a par­tial lock­down – on March 18, fol­low­ing a sharp spike in cases.</p>
    <p>With daily cases ta­per­ing, the gov­ern­ment started the re­cov­ery MCO from June 10, grad­u­ally re­open­ing</p>
    <p>DON’T TAKE IS­SUE LIGHTLY</p>
    <p>Fam­ily mem­bers and the pub­lic must al­ways ad­vise one an­other. Par­ents must al­ways re­mind their chil­dren to wear face masks when go­ing out and prac­tise so­cial dis­tanc­ing... This shouldn’t be taken lightly by all of us. I’m sure you do not want the gov­ern­ment to im­pose a lock­down if there is a spike.</p>

    <p>She said, how­ever, that there was no need for panic, as all the new cases so far have been found in peo­ple un­der quar­an­tine, Caixin Global re­ported.</p>
    <p>The State Coun­cil, China’s Cab­i­net, has dis­patched three task forces to help as­sess the sit­u­a­tion in Urumqi.</p>

    <p>But the num­ber of new cases has since been edg­ing higher slowly, av­er­ag­ing 14 new cases daily since last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day re­ported 21 new Covid-19 cases – the high­est in a month – to bring to­tal in­fec­tions to 8,800. wide shut­down due to the out­break.</p>
    <p>But it will be an al­tered ex­pe­ri­ence for movie­go­ers: on­line-only ticket sales, shut­tered snack bars, and so­cial dis­tanc­ing dur­ing screen­ings as wor­ries over Covid-19 per­sist.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas can sell no more than 30 per cent of avail­able tick­ets per show, and seat-se­lec­tion charts on lead­ing tick­et­ing apps in­di­cated that in many the­atres, peo­ple will</p>
    <p>There are 123 deaths re­lated to the virus.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rat­ing on the new clus­ters, Mr Muhyid­din said they had been de­tected since early this month.</p>
    <p>Two of the new clus­ters were traced back to an eatery in Kuala Lumpur and the Stu­tong wet mar­ket in Sarawak, while the rest orig­i­nated from over­seas re­turnees.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of cases is re­la­need to sit two seats apart.</p>
    <p>“I’m very ex­cited. I haven’t watched (a movie) in more than half a year, so I just de­cided to take to­day off and come ex­pe­ri­ence it,” said Mr Lu Yong­hao, 25, who works in the hu­man re­sources de­part­ment of a Shang­hai com­pany.</p>
    <p>Still, many cities kept their cin­e­mas shut yes­ter­day, as Beijing said it would leave the fi­nal de­ci­sion on whether to open up to the lo­cal author­i­ties. tively low com­pared with other coun­tries, Mr Muhyid­din urged Malaysians not to be com­pla­cent.</p>
    <p>“Three months of be­ing locked up is enough. Our econ­omy was badly af­fected, busi­nesses were mak­ing losses and peo­ple lost their jobs,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Should there be a spike that forces the gov­ern­ment to im­ple­ment a lock­down... it would re­sult</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas in the cap­i­tal Beijing, which ex­pe­ri­enced a fresh out­break last month, for ex­am­ple, have not re­opened.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal city did, how­ever, lower its virus alert level yes­ter­day af­ter go­ing more than two weeks with­out a new lo­cal in­fec­tion, declar­ing that it had con­tained a clus­ter that emerged last month.</p>

    <p>Last month, the gov­ern­ment an­nounced a fourth stim­u­lus pack­age for the year, bring­ing the to­tal spend­ing from pub­lic cof­fers to cush­ion the blow of the pan­demic to RM45 bil­lion.</p>
