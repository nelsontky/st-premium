    <p>Ac­claimed Bri­tish ac­tor Idris Elba (be­low) does not be­lieve in cen­sor­ship for racist tele­vi­sion shows and films. How­ever, the 47-year-old be­lieves that warn­ing la­bels at the be­gin­ning of such films or pro­grammes would make it clear to au­di­ences that cer­tain con­tent is of­fen­sive.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Ac­claimed Bri­tish ac­tor Idris Elba (left) does not be­lieve in cen­sor­ship for racist tele­vi­sion shows and films. “I be­lieve that we should be al­lowed to say what we want to say. Be­cause, af­ter all, we’re sto­ry­mak­ers.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 47-year-old be­lieves that warn­ing la­bels at the be­gin­ning of me­dia would make it clear to au­di­ences that cer­tain con­tent is of­fen­sive.</p>
    <p>“I’m very much a be­liever in free­dom of speech,” Elba said in Bri­tish mag­a­zine, Ra­dio Times. “But the thing about free­dom of speech is that it’s not suit­able for ev­ery­body.”</p>
    <p>“That’s why we have a rat­ing sys­tem – we tell you that this par­tic­u­lar con­tent is rated U, PG, 15, 18, X,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Bri­tish rat­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves that cen­sor­ship pre­vents peo­ple from un­der­stand­ing so­ci­etal con­texts and its un­der­ly­ing in­equal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“To mock the truth, you have to know the truth. But to cen­sor racist themes within a show, to pull it – wait a sec­ond, I think view­ers should know that peo­ple made shows like this.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Out of re­spect for the time and the move­ment, com­mis­sion­ers and archive-hold­ers pulling things they think are ex­cep­tion­ally tone-deaf at this time – fair enough and good for you. But I think, mov­ing for­ward, peo­ple should know that free­dom of speech is ac­cepted, but the au­di­ence should know what they’re get­ting into.”</p>
    <p>His com­ments come af­ter the re­cent in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion of the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment, which led to me­dia com­ing un­der new scru­tiny.</p>
