    <p>Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors are re­view­ing eq­uity in­vest­ments by Ant Group in dozens of com­pa­nies, three peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter said, in­ten­si­fy­ing a crack­down on bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy em­pire.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tors are con­sid­er­ing whether to in­struct Ant to di­vest some of its in­vest­ments, mainly in tech­nol­ogy and fin­tech start-ups, if they vi­o­late rules such as cre­at­ing un­fair com­pe­ti­tion in the mar­ket, one of the three sources said.</p>
    <p>Any en­forced di­vest­ments would de­prive the group of po­ten­tially lu­cra­tive in­vest­ments, com­pound­ing ex­ist­ing reg­u­la­tory pres­sure to re­vamp its busi­ness struc­ture and put up more cap­i­tal for its key con­sumer lend­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Di­vest­ments would also sig­nif­i­cantly scale back Ant’s in­flu­ence over the coun­try’s fast-grow­ing fin­tech in­dus­try, where it has sought syn­er­gies with its ex­ist­ing busi­nesses via sev­eral in­vest­ments in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>China has been crack­ing down on anti-com­pet­i­tive be­hav­iour in the coun­try’s boom­ing In­ter­net sec­tor. Reg­u­la­tors an­nounced last Sun­day an an­titrust in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Ant’s sis­ter com­pany Alibaba and also or­dered Ant to shake up its lend­ing and other con­sumer fi</p>
    <p>nance oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Ant Group de­clined to com­ment af­ter Reuters emailed the com­pany ques­tions about the reg­u­la­tory probe.</p>
    <p>The China Se­cu­ri­ties Reg­u­la­tory Com­mis­sion, which two of the sources said was lead­ing the probe, did not re­spond to a Reuters re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors are look­ing into in­vest­ments made by Ant over the past few years, the ra­tio­nale be­hind such deals and their syn­er­gies, two of the three sources said.</p>
    <p>All three peo­ple de­clined to be named as they were not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors want Ant, whose busi­nesses in­clude pay­ment pro­cess­ing, con­sumer lend­ing and in­sur­ance prod­ucts dis­tri­bu­tion, to di­vest some of its in­vest­ments un­less they are in­dis­pens­able to its busi­ness, ac­cord­ing to one of the sources.</p>
    <p>Ant has al­ready started to tap prospec­tive buy­ers, in­clud­ing pri­vate eq­uity firms, for its hold­ings in more than a dozen port­fo­lio firms, the sources said.</p>
    <p>A fourth per­son with knowl­edge of the mat­ter said Ant had not yet re­ceived any guid­ance from reg­u­la­tors about dis­pos­ing its eq­uity in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors have set about rein­ing in Mr Ma’s fi­nan­cial and e-com­merce em­pires since he pub­licly crit­i­cised the coun­try’s reg­u­la­tory sys­tem in Oc­to­ber for sti­fling in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>That set off a chain of events that ul­ti­mately tor­pe­doed Ant’s US$37 bil­lion (S$48.9 bil­lion) IPO, which would have been the world’s largest ini­tial public of­fer­ing, last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Ant traces its be­gin­nings to Ali­pay, which was launched in 2004 as a pay­ment ser­vice, and is 33 per cent owned by Alibaba.</p>
    <p>The fin­tech ti­tan founded and con­trolled by Mr Ma has made a to­tal of 81 eq­uity in­vest­ments, in­clud­ing in a Chi­nese state bank and an In­dian dig­i­tal pay­ment pro­ces­sor, worth US$21.6 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to Refini­tiv data.</p>
    <p>More than half its in­vest­ments – 55 deals worth US$17.4 bil­lion – have been made at home, in­clud­ing in the Postal Sav­ings Bank of China, the coun­try’s big­gest bank by num­ber of branches, and top ride-hail­ing firm Didi Chux­ing.</p>
    <p>Ant is con­sid­er­ing fold­ing most of its fi­nan­cial busi­nesses, in­clud­ing con­sumer lend­ing, into a hold­ing com­pany that would be tightly reg­u­lated like tra­di­tional fi­nan­cial firms, Reuters re­ported last week.</p>
    <p>Reuters also re­ported early last month that Ant was con­sid­er­ing sell­ing its 30 per cent stake in In­dian dig­i­tal pay­ment pro­ces­sor Paytm amid ten­sions be­tween Bei­jing and New Delhi and a tough­en­ing com­pet­i­tive land­scape. Paytm and Ant had at that time said the in­for­ma­tion was in­cor­rect.</p>
    <p>Ant re­ferred Reuters to its pre­vi­ous state­ment, while Paytm did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment last Thurs­day.</p>
