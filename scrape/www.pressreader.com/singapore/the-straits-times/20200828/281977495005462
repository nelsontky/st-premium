    <p>Malaysia’s Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz yes­ter­day said there is noth­ing wrong with con­duct­ing di­rect ne­go­ti­a­tions, back­track­ing from ac­cus­ing the pre­vi­ous Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) gov­ern­ment just days ago of giv­ing out bil­lions of ring­git worth of con­tracts with­out ten­der.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing that the is­sue should not be politi­cised, Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul said there are poli­cies which en­able jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for di­rect ne­go­ti­a­tions un­der Sec­tion 6 (1) of the Fi­nan­cial Pro­ce­dure Act 1957 (Re­vised 1972).</p>
    <p>“To me, it is just fac­tual, and a re­flec­tion of what was signed based on the data (let­ter of awards signed) that we have in the Min­istry of Fi­nance, and it should not be an is­sue,” he told re­porters at an event in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>Min­utes ear­lier, his pre­de­ces­sor Lim Guan Eng re­sponded to Mr Zafrul’s rev­e­la­tion in Par­lia­ment on Mon­day that the PH ad­min­is­tra­tion dished out RM6.61 bil­lion (S$2.16 bil­lion) in 101 “di­rect nego” con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Un­der pres­sure from op­po­si­tion MPs, the gov­ern­ment on Wed­nes­day re­leased de­tails of the 101 con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Most of the RM6.61 bil­lion, Lim told a news con­fer­ence, went to legacy projects (67.7 per cent) and con­tracts for sup­plies or ser­vices (26.5 per cent) taken on dur­ing the Barisan Na­sional ad­min­is­tra­tion that was top­pled in 2018.</p>
    <p>He added that PH was re­spon­si­ble for only 5.3 per cent of the RM6.61 bil­lion in con­tracts awarded dur­ing its 22 months in power.</p>
    <p>The is­sue sur­faced in Par­lia­ment on Mon­day when the Fi­nance Min­is­ter was re­spond­ing to queries about di­rectly award­ing con­tracts with­out open ten­der dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. He said this was nec­es­sary due to the ur­gent sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Zafrul said PH had also en­gaged in di­rect ne­go­ti­a­tions, a claim that caused an up­roar as the coali­tion had promised to do away with the prac­tice in its man­i­festo ahead of the 2018 election.</p>
    <p>The term “di­rect ne­go­ti­a­tions” has be­come a by­word for cor­rup­tion over the decades, with al­le­ga­tions of large gov­ern­ment con­tracts di­rectly awarded to crony com­pa­nies. Malaysia’s anti-cor­rup­tion com­mis­sion has also said it will be study­ing the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>While the list was sup­posed to show PH had awarded con­tracts with­out open ten­der, it has in­stead re­vealed the short­com­ings of mem­ber par­ties in the cur­rent Perikatan Na­sional ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The list of 101 projects showed that two-thirds of the RM6.61 bil­lion was for the Klang Val­ley Dou­ble Track Phase 2 up­grade. The project was ini­tially di­rectly awarded to Dhaya Maju LTAT two days be­fore Par­lia­ment was dis­solved in 2018.</p>
    <p>PH had can­celled the RM5.3 bil­lion deal be­fore re-award­ing it last year to Dhaya Maju LTAT – a joint ven­ture in­volv­ing the armed forces pen­sion fund – at a re­duced cost of RM4.5 bil­lion.</p>
