    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion (SGX RegCo) could have en­hanced pow­ers in fu­ture, in­clud­ing is­su­ing a pub­lic rep­ri­mand to firms caught in wrong­do­ing and re­quir­ing a firm to sus­pend di­rec­tors or ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cers. Com­pa­nies could also be ex­pected to have whis­tle-blow­ing poli­cies as part of list­ing rule re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s reg­u­la­tory arm, Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion (SGX RegCo) could get en­hanced pow­ers in the fu­ture, in­clud­ing the abil­ity to is­sue a pub­lic rep­ri­mand to com­pa­nies caught in wrong­do­ing and to re­quire a firm to sus­pend di­rec­tors or ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies could also be ex­pected to have whistle­blow­ing poli­cies as part of list­ing rule re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Part of pro­posed changes to the en­force­ment frame­work, the mea­sures were laid out by SGX RegCo chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Boon Gin at a me­dia brief­ing on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“In­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies will be tempted now more than ever to com­mit wrong­do­ing in one form or an­other (and this is true not just in Sin­ga­pore but ev­ery­where). As the reg­u­la­tor, we need to work to­gether with the com­mu­nity to raise stan­dards across the en­tire mar­ket,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Given the ef­fects of Covid-19, our tar­geted ap­proach to reg­u­la­tion must go fur­ther. Job cre­ation and eco­nomic re­cov­ery need reg­u­la­tory frame­works that are sup­port­ive. This ap­plies not just to com­pa­nies that are al­ready listed but also to com­pa­nies that may be tap­ping the pub­lic mar­kets for the first time. Sav­ing jobs may also re­quire sup­port­ive reg­u­la­tory frame­works to fa­cil­i­tate the re­struc­tur­ing of listed com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>The pro­posed changes to the en­force­ment frame­work will al­low quicker ac­tion to be taken against er­rant com­pa­nies, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, pub­lic sanc­tions are meted out by an in­de­pen­dent List­ings Dis­ci­plinary Com­mit­tee (LDC), which was set up in 2015 and con­sists of ex­pe­ri­enced mar­ket pro­fes­sion­als. But the com­mit­tee has heard only three out of 18 pend­ing no­tices of charges be­cause of de­lays due to con­flicts of in­ter­est. Cau­tious of these, com­mit­tee mem­bers have had to re­cuse them­selves, caus­ing some pro­ceed­ings to restart.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new frame­work, SGX RegCo can im­pose all pub­lic sanc­tions that the LDC does, ex­cept for fines, which are the most se­vere mea­sure. It can is­sue pub­lic rep­ri­mands, re­quire a direc­tor or ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer to re­sign from ex­ist­ing po­si­tions, pro­hibit a com­pany from ap­point­ing the direc­tor, or re­quire a firm to sus­pend the direc­tor for not more than three years.</p>
    <p>Be­sides en­force­ment, SGX RegCo is also propos­ing that all listed com­pa­nies have to put in place and dis­close de­tails of their whis­tle-blow­ing poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said that with the pro­posed changes, firms will have to dis­close specif­i­cally how they pre­serve the con­fi­den­tial­ity of whis­tle-blow­ers and pro­tect them from reprisals.</p>
    <p>Com­ments on the pro­posal can be e-mailed to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change by Sept 7.</p>
    <p>Job cre­ation and eco­nomic re­cov­ery need reg­u­la­tory frame­works that are sup­port­ive. This ap­plies not just to com­pa­nies that are al­ready listed but also to com­pa­nies that may be tap­ping the pub­lic mar­kets for the first time. Sav­ing jobs may also re­quire sup­port­ive reg­u­la­tory frame­works to fa­cil­i­tate the ’’ re­struc­tur­ing of listed com­pa­nies.</p>
