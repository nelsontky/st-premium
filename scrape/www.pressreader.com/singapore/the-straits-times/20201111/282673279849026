    <p>The fast-food chain is in­tro­duc­ing a meat­less burger to cater to the grow­ing num­ber of peo­ple who do not eat meat</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Fast-food gi­ant McDonald’s on Mon­day an­nounced it was launch­ing a new plant-based burger named the McPlant, to cater to the grow­ing num­ber of peo­ple who do not eat meat.</p>
    <p>The brand had fallen be­hind in the niche mar­ket to ri­val Burger King, which was the first to launch a veg­e­tar­ian ver­sion of its iconic Whop­per burger in April last year in the United States.</p>
    <p>Other chains such as Dunkin’ or Star­bucks have also dipped their toes in the grow­ing plant-based mar­ket, as con­sumers be­come more aware of their health, the im­pact of live­stock farm­ing on the en­vi­ron­ment and an­i­mal rights.</p>
    <p>McDonald’s had al­ready tested out a plant-based burger in Canada in co­op­er­a­tion with the com­pany Be­yond Meat, which spe­cialises in ve­gan meat sub­sti­tutes.</p>
    <p>Such sub­sti­tutes, like soya, have ex­isted for a long time, but new com­pa­nies such as Be­yond Meat and Im­pos­si­ble Burger have de­vel­oped prod­ucts that closer re­sem­ble meat in taste, tex­ture and colour.</p>
    <p>The new line will be pro­duced ex­clu­sively for McDonald’s and will be in­tro­duced in se­lected mar­kets next year. There is no in­for­ma­tion yet on which the mar­kets are, said McDonald’s Sin­ga­pore when asked.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant chain has not yet said if it will re­new its col­lab­o­ra­tion with Be­yond Meat, say­ing only it will reach out to third-party sup­pli­ers as with all its other prod­ucts. Be­yond Meat shares dropped about 4 per cent on the an­nounce­ment by the food gi­ant.</p>
    <p>McDonald’s told in­vestors it was also con­sid­er­ing plant-based sub­sti­tutes for chicken prod­ucts and for its egg and ba­con break­fast sand­wiches. “We are ex­cited about the op­por­tu­nity be­cause we be­lieve we have a proven, de­li­cious-tast­ing prod­uct,” said Mr Ian Bor­den, who heads McDonald’s in­ter­na­tional op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>McDonald’s still re­lies on its flag­ship prod­ucts such as the Big Mac, McNuggets and french fries, which ac­count for about 70 per cent of its sales in its main mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“As de­mand for the fa­mil­iar in these un­cer­tain times is more im­por­tant than ever, the com­pany be­lieves these core clas­sics will con­tinue to be sig­nif­i­cant driv­ers of growth, thanks to their pop­u­lar­ity and prof­itabil­ity,” McDonald’s said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also aims to put a new em­pha­sis on chicken-based prod­ucts, which are grow­ing faster than the mar­ket for beef prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the suc­cess of its spicy nuggets in the US, McDonald’s plans to launch a crispy chicken sand­wich there next year.</p>
    <p>To boost In­ter­net sales, which have al­ready grown sig­nif­i­cantly since the start of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the group will also test a new on­line plat­form and a new loy­alty pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It will build new drive-in-only out­lets and have lines ded­i­cated to cus­tomers who pre-or­dered their meals on­line.</p>
    <p>The group saw its global turnover fall by 2 per cent in the third quar­ter due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>That was none­the­less bet­ter than the 30 per cent drop in sales in the sec­ond quar­ter. The com­pany man­aged to gen­er­ate a net profit up 10 per cent at US$1.76 bil­lion (S$2.37 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Al­most all of the chain’s restau­rants re­mained open dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
