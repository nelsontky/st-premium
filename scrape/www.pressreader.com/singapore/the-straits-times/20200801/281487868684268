    <p>KATHER­INE LEONG, 49</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant di­rec­tor of nurs­ing Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH) Ad­vanced prac­tice nurse Khoo Teck Puat – Na­tional Univer­sity Chil­dren’s Med­i­cal In­sti­tute, NUH</p>
    <p>The mi­grant work­ers who streamed out of the buses and stood in front of the com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity (CCF) in Tuas South looked dazed and ner­vous.</p>
    <p>But they seemed more at ease when they saw the group of health­care work­ers, clad in thick per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE), wav­ing to and wel­com­ing them.</p>
    <p>Ms Kather­ine Leong, 49, who led the nurs­ing team at the Tuas South CCF, knows a smat­ter­ing of Ben­gali and Tamil from meet­ing pa­tients and fam­i­lies as an ad­vanced prac­tice nurse with the Khoo Teck Puat – Na­tional Univer­sity Chil­dren’s Med­i­cal In­sti­tute at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH).</p>
    <p>“When the mi­grant work­ers ar­rived, I greeted them by say­ing ‘ke­mon acho’, which means ‘how are you’ in Ben­gali,” said Ms Leong, who is also the as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of nurs­ing at NUH.</p>
    <p>“The broth­ers laughed and thought it was amus­ing, and greeted me back, and that broke the ice a lit­tle,” she added, re­fer­ring to the mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Leong and her team of 28 NUH nurses and l ocum nurses, along with the med­i­cal team, made it a point to call the work­ers broth­ers.</p>
    <p>The Tuas South fa­cil­ity, the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem’s first CCF, was set up in mid-May to house about 1,600 Covid-19 pa­tients who were asymp­to­matic or had mild symp­toms.</p>
    <p>In late April, Ms Leong led the nurs­ing team in set­ting up the fa­cil­ity and was de­ployed there un­til early last month.</p>
    <p>Her team was in charge of set­ting up a med­i­cal post, train­ing the non­med­i­cal staff on in­fec­tion con­trol and how to prop­erly don and re­move PPE, and tak­ing care of the mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Once, a mi­grant worker came up to me and said: ‘Ma’am, I give you money, you buy phone for me.’ His phone was bro­ken, and he hadn’t spo­ken to his fam­ily in five days.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing a nurses’ meet­ing, a col­league told me she had an old phone that she could pass to him.”</p>
    <p>Ms Leong also fondly re­called a help­ful In­dian mi­grant worker in his 40s who helped the nurses teach the pa­tients how to mea­sure and record their vi­tal signs on tablets.</p>
    <p>“He spon­ta­neously went to dif­fer­ent groups to teach them how to use the equip­ment to mea­sure blood pres­sure and take tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>“Through­out his eight- to 10-day stay, he would come to the ad­mis­sions area at 10am, when the buses started ar­riv­ing, and at noon, he wouldn’t go for lunch be­cause more mi­grant work­ers were com­ing. We had to in­sist that he go and eat be­fore re­turn­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Leong said the work­ers were ap­pre­cia­tive of be­ing taken care of in the CCF. “They al­ways said ‘thank you so much’. If we were sweat­ing through our PPE, our hair damp and gog­gles fogged up, the broth­ers would feel bad for us and say ‘Ma’am, very hot, ah. Sweat too much’.</p>
    <p>“One of my nurses jok­ingly replied, ‘Never mind. It’s like a sauna, can lose weight’.”</p>
