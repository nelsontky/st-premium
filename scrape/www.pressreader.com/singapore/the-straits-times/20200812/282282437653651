    <p>De­sign and feel</p>
    <p>The Note20 phones feel light­weight given their size and I can hold each in one hand with­out any is­sues.</p>
    <p>While both phones look sim­i­lar – slim and sleek – the big­gest dif­fer­ence be­tween the reg­u­lar Note20 and the larger Note20, be­sides screen size, is the curves.</p>
    <p>The Note20 has a flat screen with straight edges on the sides, while the larger Note20 Ul­tra’s dis­play is curved to­wards its sides, not un­like last year’s S10 phone. This means the phones have a dif­fer­ent feel to them when held in the hand and it is down to the per­sonal pref­er­ence of users.</p>
    <p>The new phones come in sev­eral colours, which can af­fect not just their looks, but also their feel. The Note20 will be avail­able in three colours – bronze, green and grey. The Note20 Ul­tra comes in bronze, black and white.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­lar Note20 has a tex­tured back re­gard­less of which colour you choose.</p>
    <p>The black and white colours for the Note20 Ul­tra fea­ture a glossy fin­ish. On the other hand, the bronze Note20 Ul­tra has a tex­tured, matt fin­ish that helps to cut down on fin­ger­prints and smudges on the back of the phone and is, at least to this writer, the most beau­ti­ful of the colours.</p>
    <p>There are also some de­sign changes in the Note20 phones com­pared with last year’s Note10. The S Pen sty­lus – used for tak­ing hand­writ­ten notes and other tasks – is lo­cated on the bot­tom left of the phone in­stead of the right.</p>
    <p>The vol­ume con­trol and power but­tons have been moved to the right for the Note20 se­ries from the left. This may be good for some peo­ple and bad for oth­ers. But I pre­fer the new but­ton lay­out – it is more nat­u­ral and con­ve­nient to ac­cess the but­tons.</p>
    <p>Note tak­ing</p>
    <p>What sets the Note phones apart from their S se­ries cousins is the S Pen sty­lus for writ­ing notes. Scrib­bling on the Note20 phones’ screens with the sty­lus feels close to writ­ing on pa­per and the process is pos­si­bly more re­spon­sive than last year’s Note10.</p>
    <p>While more test­ing is needed, this is likely be­cause the new sty­lus is said to have a 40 per cent la­tency im­prove­ment for both Note20 mod­els over last year’s phones.</p>
    <p>The S Pen also has a handy fea­ture for peo­ple who have trou­ble writ­ing notes in a straight line – a func­tion that au­to­mat­i­cally “straight­ens” text scrib­bled in a slanted way with the tap of an on­screen but­ton. And it worked for me.</p>
    <p>The Note20’s note-tak­ing app, Sam­sung Notes, now has a more in­tu­itive folder-man­age­ment sys­tem that makes it eas­ier for users to find notes. This means no more brows­ing the en­tire notes li­brary to find what is needed.</p>
    <p>Price, avail­abil­ity</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Note20 will come in 4G ($1,398) and 5G ($1,548) ver­sions, while the Note20 Ul­tra will come only in the 5G ver­sion ($1,898).</p>
    <p>The Note20 se­ries phones will be avail­able from Aug 21.</p>
