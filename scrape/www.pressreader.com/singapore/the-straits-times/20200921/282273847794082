    <p>DUBLIN • Face­book has told Ire­land’s High Court that it can­not see how its ser­vices could op­er­ate in the Euro­pean Union if reg­u­la­tors freeze its data trans­fer mech­a­nism, the Sun­day Busi­ness Post re­ported, cit­ing court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The US so­cial me­dia gi­ant last week said the Ir­ish Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion, its lead EU reg­u­la­tor, had made a pre­lim­i­nary de­ci­sion that the mech­a­nism Face­book uses to trans­fer data from the EU to the US “can­not in prac­tice be used”.</p>
    <p>Face­book re­quested and se­cured a tem­po­rary freeze on the or­der and a court re­view in the Ir­ish High Court, which is due to con­sider the is­sue in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>In an af­fi­davit sub­mit­ted to the court to re­quest that the or­der be frozen, Ms Yvonne Cun­nane, Face­book Ire­land’s head of data pro­tec­tion, said it was not clear how the com­pany could con­tinue pro­vid­ing ser­vices in the EU if the Ir­ish or­der is en­forced, the pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>The af­fi­davit has not been made pub­lic, a High Court spokesman said, and a Face­book spokesman did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to an e-mailed re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>In a Sept 9 blog post that first con­firmed the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, Face­book said it re­lied on the mech­a­nism – un­der what are known as stan­dard con­trac­tual clauses (SCCs) – to trans­fer data to coun­tries out­side the EU and that a ban would have “a far-reach­ing ef­fect on busi­nesses that rely on SCCs”.</p>
    <p>The Ir­ish probe fol­lows a rul­ing by the Court of Jus­tice of the EU in July on when SCCs can be used legally. The rul­ing was in re­sponse to EU con­cerns that the sur­veil­lance regime in the US might not re­spect the pri­vacy rights of EU cit­i­zens when their per­sonal data is sent to the US for com­mer­cial use.</p>
