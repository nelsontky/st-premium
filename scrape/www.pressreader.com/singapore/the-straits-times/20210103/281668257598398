    <p>As the ar­rival of the first batch of Covid-19 vac­cines in Malaysia nears, Mr Ab­dul­lah Salleh finds him­self in two minds about re­ceiv­ing an im­mu­ni­sa­tion shot.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing pro-vac­cine, the 37-year-old videog­ra­pher said he is hes­i­tant about tak­ing a shot due to the pos­si­bil­ity of ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a lethal ad­verse re­ac­tion, as he is al­ler­gic to cer­tain drugs.</p>
    <p>“I’m ac­tu­ally wor­ried be­cause I’m al­ler­gic to Aug­mentin-based drugs. I hope the sub­stance is not in­cluded in the vac­cine,” he said. Aug­mentin is an an­tibi­otic used to treat bac­te­rial in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment, I’m hon­estly not sure if I should get it or not. I’ve been read­ing up a lot on the avail­able vac­cines but my neardeath ex­pe­ri­ence due to my al­lergy has made me very scep­ti­cal,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul­lah is among the 17 per cent of re­spon­dents in a Health Min­istry sur­vey who are un­sure of the vac­cine, with over 83 per cent of them ex­press­ing fear of pos­si­ble side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, which was done on­line be­tween Dec 21 and 28, was held to gauge the interest of Malaysians in get­ting the Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have cast doubts on the vac­cine, with some claim­ing that it may con­tain porcine el­e­ments and oth­ers ques­tion­ing the trust­wor­thi­ness of the man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>Up to 78 per cent of those in the un­cer­tain group also had less con­fi­dence that the vac­cines would work, while 71 per cent felt they would be un­safe for use.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, about 16 per cent of re­spon­dents stated that they would not agree to be­ing vac­ci­nated. Of this group, over 96 per cent said side ef­fects were the main rea­son for op­pos­ing vac­ci­na­tion, while close to 85 per cent were sus­pi­cious of its in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>Based on the re­sult, which was re­leased on Thurs­day, only 67 per cent of the to­tal of 212,006 peo­ple sam­pled said they would ac­cept the Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Health­care an­a­lyst Heikal Ros­nan, di­rec­tor of Bower Group Asia, said he un­der­stood the public’s con­cerns, but noted that what gov­ern­ments have done is to help speed up the vac­cine-mak­ing process, com­press­ing it from pos­si­bly more than a decade, with­out tak­ing short­cuts.</p>
    <p>He added: “More im­por­tantly, the Health Min­istry has stated that each Covid-19 vac­cine will have to go through five phases of tests and tri­als be­fore it can be ap­proved for use in Malaysia. There will be hic­cups given the un­prece­dented na­ture of this pan­demic, but over­all, the coun­try’s im­mu­ni­sa­tion track record is sound.”</p>
    <p>Ms S. Kala­mathy, 41, how­ever, plans to re­ject any Rus­sian and Chi­nese-made vac­cines. “I just don’t trust them,” said the le­gal ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>Mr Heikal said peo­ple may be dis­trust­ful of the Rus­sian and Chi­nese gov­ern­ments rather than the vac­cine it­self, and have less con­fi­dence in their ap­proval pro­cesses, which are not as trans­par­ent and strin­gent as in the United States and Europe.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately though, if it works, then it works, but Malaysia may take a wait-and-see ap­proach, com­pared with the US vac­cines,” he said.</p>
