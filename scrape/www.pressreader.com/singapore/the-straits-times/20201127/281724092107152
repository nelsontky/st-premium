    <p>•</p>
    <p>“Quar­an­tine” has been named the 2020 Word of the Year by Cam­bridge Dic­tionary.</p>
    <p>Cam­bridge Dic­tionary said its data shows it was one of the most highly searched words on its web­site this year.</p>
    <p>Cam­bridge Dic­tionary pub­lish­ing man­ager Wen­da­lyn Ni­chols said users have been search­ing for words re­lated to the so­cial and economic im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Quar­an­tine” was closely fol­lowed by “lock­down” and “pan­demic” on the short­list, she said in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Nei­ther ‘coronaviru­s’ nor ‘Covid-19’ ap­peared among the words that Cam­bridge Dic­tionary users mostly searched for this year. We be­lieve this in­di­cates that peo­ple have been fairly con­fi­dent about what the virus is,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Collins Dic­tionary said “lock­down” is its Word of the Year in 2020 fol­low­ing a dra­matic in­crease in us­age dur­ing the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Lex­i­cog­ra­phers said they picked the word be­cause it had be­come syn­ony­mous with the ex­pe­ri­ence of pop­u­la­tions world­wide as gov­ern­ments look to curb the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Cam­bridge Dic­tionary said “quar­an­tine” was the only word to rank in the top five for both search spikes and over­all views, num­ber­ing over 183,000 by early Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“The Cam­bridge Dic­tionary ed­i­tors have also tracked how peo­ple are us­ing ‘quar­an­tine’, and have dis­cov­ered a new mean­ing emerg­ing: ‘a gen­eral pe­riod of time in which peo­ple are not al­lowed to leave their homes or travel freely, so that they do not catch or spread a dis­ease’,” it added.</p>
    <p>The pub­lisher, which is part of the Univer­sity of Cam­bridge, said re­search shows the word is be­ing used syn­ony­mously with “lock­down”, par­tic­u­larly in the United States, to re­fer to a sit­u­a­tion in which peo­ple stay home to avoid catch­ing the dis­ease.</p>
