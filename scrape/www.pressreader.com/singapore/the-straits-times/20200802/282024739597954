    <p>Peo­ple with con­sis­tently high lev­els of blood sugar could get less ben­e­fit from ex­er­cise than those whose blood sugar lev­els are nor­mal, according to a cau­tion­ary new study of nu­tri­tion, blood sugar and ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>The study, which in­volved ro­dents and peo­ple, sug­gests that eat­ing a diet high in sugar and pro­cessed foods, which may set the stage for poor blood sugar con­trol, could dent our long-term health in part by chang­ing how well our bod­ies re­spond to a work­out.</p>
    <p>We al­ready have plenty of ev­i­dence, of course, that el­e­vated blood sugar is un­healthy.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with hy­per­gly­caemia tend to be over­weight and face greater long-term risks for heart dis­ease and Type 2 di­a­betes, even if, in the early stages, their con­di­tion does not meet the cri­te­ria for those dis­eases.</p>
    <p>They also tend to be out of shape. In epi­demi­o­log­i­cal stud­ies, peo­ple with el­e­vated blood sugar of­ten also have low aer­o­bic fit­ness, while, in an­i­mal stud­ies, rats bred with low en­durance from birth show early blood-sugar prob­lems, as well.</p>
    <p>This in­ter­re­la­tion­ship be­tween blood sugar and fit­ness is con­se­quen­tial in part be­cause low aer­o­bic fit­ness is closely linked to a high risk of pre­ma­ture death.</p>
    <p>But most past stud­ies of blood sugar and fit­ness have been epi­demi­o­log­i­cal, mean­ing they have iden­ti­fied links be­tween the two con­di­tions but not their se­quence or mech­a­nisms.</p>
    <p>They have not clar­i­fied whether hy­per­gly­caemia usu­ally pre­cedes and leads to low fit­ness, or the other way around, or how ei­ther con­di­tion man­ages to in­flu­ence the other.</p>
    <p>So, for the new study, which was pub­lished last month in Na­ture Me­tab­o­lism, re­searchers at the Joslin Di­a­betes Centre in Bos­ton and other in­sti­tu­tions de­cided to raise blood sugar lev­els in mice and see what hap­pened when they ex­er­cised.</p>
    <p>They started with adult mice, switch­ing some from nor­mal chow to a diet high in sugar and sat­u­rated fat, sim­i­lar to what many of us in the de­vel­oped world eat nowa­days. These mice rapidly gained weight and de­vel­oped ha­bit­u­ally high blood sugar.</p>
    <p>They in­jected other mice with a sub­stance that re­duces their abil­ity to pro­duce in­sulin, a hor­mone that helps to con­trol blood sugar, sim­i­lar to when peo­ple have cer­tain forms of di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>Those an­i­mals did not get fat­ter, but their blood sugar lev­els rose to the same ex­tent as among the mice in the sug­ary diet group.</p>
    <p>Other an­i­mals re­mained on their nor­mal chow, as a con­trol group.</p>
    <p>After four months, the sci­en­tists checked each mouse’s fit­ness by mea­sur­ing how long it could run on a tread­mill before ex­haus­tion.</p>
    <p>They then put a run­ning wheel in each an­i­mal’s cage and let them jog at will for the next six weeks, which they did. On av­er­age, each mouse ran about 482km dur­ing that month and a half.</p>
    <p>But they did not all gain the same level of fit­ness. The con­trol group now ran for a much longer pe­riod of time on the tread­mill before ex­haus­tion; they were much fit­ter. The an­i­mals with high blood sugar showed lit­tle im­prove­ment. Their aer­o­bic fit­ness had barely budged.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, their ex­er­cise re­sis­tance was the same, whether their blood sugar prob­lems stemmed from poor diet or lack of in­sulin, and whether they were over­weight or slim­mer. If they had high blood sugar, they re­sisted the ben­e­fits of ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>To bet­ter un­der­stand why, the sci­en­tists next looked in­side mus­cles. And con­di­tions there were telling. The mus­cles of the con­trol an­i­mals teemed with healthy, new mus­cle fi­bres and a net­work of new blood ves­sels fer­ry­ing ex­tra oxy­gen and fuel to them.</p>
    <p>But the mus­cle tis­sues of the an­i­mals with high blood sugar dis­played mostly new de­posits of col­la­gen, a rigid sub­stance that seems to have crowded out new blood ves­sels and pre­vented the mus­cles from adapt­ing to the ex­er­cise and con­tribut­ing to bet­ter fit­ness.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, since ro­dents are not peo­ple, the sci­en­tists checked blood sugar lev­els and en­durance in a group of 24 young adults. None had di­a­betes, although some had blood­sugar lev­els that could be con­sid­ered pre-di­a­betic.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing tread­mill fit­ness test­ing, those vol­un­teers with the worst blood-sugar con­trol also had the low­est en­durance, and when the sci­en­tists later mi­cro­scop­i­cally ex­am­ined their mus­cle tis­sues after the ex­er­cise, they found high ac­ti­va­tion of pro­teins that can in­hibit im­prove­ments to aer­o­bic fit­ness.</p>
    <p>Taken as a whole, these re­sults in mice and peo­ple sug­gest that “con­stantly bathing your tis­sues in sugar is just not a good idea” and could un­der­cut any sub­se­quent ben­e­fits from ex­er­cise, says Sarah Les­sard, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at the Joslin Di­a­betes Centre and Har­vard Med­i­cal School who over­saw the new study.</p>
    <p>In prac­ti­cal terms, the find­ings sug­gest that, for those of us whose blood-sugar lev­els de­pend on our di­ets, we might want to “cut back on sugar” and the highly pro­cessed, fatty foods that also can raise blood sugar and blunt ex­er­cise ef­fects, she says.</p>
    <p>More fun­da­men­tally, the study in­ti­mates that “diet and ex­er­cise should be con­sid­ered to­gether” when we start think­ing about how to im­prove our health. They af­fect each other and they in­flu­ence how each af­fects us more than we might ex­pect, Dr Les­sard says.</p>
    <p>But per­haps most im­por­tant, the study con­tains some en­cour­ag­ing data. The hy­per­gly­caemic mice gained lit­tle en­durance from their weeks of work­ing out but they were be­gin­ning to show early signs of bet­ter blood-sugar con­trol.</p>
    <p>So, it might re­quire time and gritty de­ter­mi­na­tion, but ex­er­cise even­tu­ally could help peo­ple with hy­per­gly­caemia to sta­bilise their blood sugar, she says, and then start feel­ing their fit­ness rise.</p>
    <p>Taken as a whole, these re­sults in mice and peo­ple sug­gest that “con­stantly bathing your tis­sues in sugar is just not a good idea” and could un­der­cut any sub­se­quent ben­e­fits from ex­er­cise, says Sarah Les­sard, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at the Joslin Di­a­betes Centre and Har­vard Med­i­cal School, who over­saw the new study.</p>
