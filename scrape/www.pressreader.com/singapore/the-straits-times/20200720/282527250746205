    <p>Six months since Sin­ga­pore con­firmed its first Covid-19 case and a month into the sec­ond phase of the re­open­ing of the coun­try’s econ­omy, peo­ple are still grap­pling with the fall­out from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts and com­pa­nies in­ter­viewed say that for many em­ploy­ees, the emo­tional toll in­cludes fears of be­ing in­fected as much as anx­i­ety tied to the eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and job sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions high­lighted in May the need to pri­ori­tise men­tal health dur­ing the pan­demic, stat­ing that while it is “a phys­i­cal health cri­sis, it has the seeds of a ma­jor men­tal health cri­sis as well”.</p>
    <p>Dr Sanveen Kang, prin­ci­pal clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at Psych Con­nect clinic, says em­ploy­ees have had to grieve the loss of their roles, ad­just quickly to new work de­mands, learn new skills with­out much train­ing and deal with the loss of re­la­tion­ships at work due to so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures or their peers los­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>She says: “The psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact of the pan­demic on an em­ployee go­ing back to work dur­ing phase two has been stress, worry and high lev­els of un­cer­tainty. More­over, those with pre-ex­ist­ing men­tal health con­di­tions such as de­pres­sion, anx­i­ety and ob­ses­sive com­pul­sive dis­or­der may find that these are be­ing ex­ac­er­bated by the cur­rent con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>To help em­ploy­ees keep up their spir­its, some firms here have in­tro­duced sup­port mea­sures such as helplines or catch-up ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Such sup­port for em­ploy­ees was one of the pri­or­i­ties of or­gan­i­sa­tions in Sin­ga­pore that took part in a poll of more than 1,000 hu­man re­source and in-house health­care pro­fes­sion­als world­wide, con­ducted by med­i­cal and travel ser­vices firm In­ter­na­tional SOS.</p>
    <p>French multi­na­tional com­pany Idemia is one of the firms step­ping</p>
    <p>The psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact of the pan­demic on an em­ployee go­ing back to work dur­ing phase two has been stress, worry and high lev­els of un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>DR SANVEEN KANG, prin­ci­pal clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at Psych Con­nect clinic</p>
    <p>up men­tal health ben­e­fits for staff. It has more than 100 em­ploy­ees in its Sin­ga­pore of­fice, 60 per cent of whom are work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>The com­pany spe­cial­is­ing in se­cu­rity and iden­tity so­lu­tions has been im­ple­ment­ing var­i­ous forms of sup­port for its staff since April.</p>
    <p>It holds weekly we­bi­nars where a pro­fes­sional is in­vited to talk on top­ics such as how to main­tain men­tal health while work­ing from home and com­mu­ni­cat­ing ef­fec­tively when work­ing re­motely.</p>
    <p>Idemia’s vice-pres­i­dent of hu­man re­sources for the Asia-Pa­cific, Ms Nathalie Ras­cle, says some em­ploy­ees said they strug­gled to ad­just to work­ing in the same space with fam­ily or be­ing alone dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and un­der work-fromhome arrangemen­ts. The stress was am­pli­fied by the feel­ing of iso­la­tion and los­ing touch with the team, she adds.</p>
    <p>“We have re­ceived a fair num­ber of in­quiries, roughly 20 per cent, re­quest­ing sup­port as they were wor­ried about Covid-19 and were fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties in their per­sonal lives.”</p>
    <p>The firm or­gan­ised a live we­bi­nar with a doc­tor last month for its em­ploy­ees across the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion. Ms Ras­cle said the aim was to share in­for­ma­tion on preven­tion and mit­i­ga­tion of the virus.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees could raise ques­tions dur­ing the ses­sion and were given the op­tion to get in touch with the doc­tor in­di­vid­u­ally.</p>
    <p>The firm holds bi-weekly catchup ses­sions with the man­age­ment team where they share pro­fes­sional up­dates and also dis­cuss how they are cop­ing with the pan­demic. Non-work-re­lated con­ver­sa­tions, from movies to mu­sic, are en­cour­aged to foster so­cial con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees can ac­cess an on­line plat­form for ca­reer and per­sonal de­vel­op­ment train­ing re­sources, which in­cludes well-be­ing at work.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist Feli­cia Neo of Neo Cooper Psy­chol­ogy Clinic said some peo­ple may en­counter cer­tain lev­els of so­cial anx­i­ety be­cause they have been in iso­la­tion for an ex­tended pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>“They would com­monly ex­press fears and anx­i­ety about rein­te­grat­ing back into the work­ing en­vi­ron­ment,” says Dr Neo.</p>
    <p>She adds that most of the re­turn­ing em­ploy­ees would con­tinue to have a cloud of fear over their heads with re­gard to po­ten­tial re­trench­ment and salary re­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>The need to cope with con­stant changes, un­cer­tainty and the lack of pre­dictabil­ity can cause over­whelm­ing stress.</p>
    <p>“Many in­di­vid­u­als also feel alone through­out this process, as ev­ery­one feels and re­acts dif­fer­ently to the pan­demic. We are all in the same stormy sea but ev­ery­one’s boat is dif­fer­ent; this can lead to an am­pli­fied sense of iso­la­tion,” says Dr Neo.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) has also been pro­vid­ing sup­port for its em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes we­bi­nars by doc­tors on how to build men­tal re­silience; tips on emo­tional, phys­i­cal and men­tal well-be­ing; and a peer­sup­port pro­gramme where 50 of its em­ploy­ees have been trained at the Cen­tre For Ef­fec­tive Liv­ing to spot signs of men­tal health is­sues among their col­leagues.</p>
    <p>“Many staff are un­aware that they have men­tal health prob­lems. Such ini­tia­tives de­mys­tify the topic and pro­vide an av­enue for peo­ple to dis­cuss it openly,” says Mr Dean Tong, head of group hu­man re­sources at UOB.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey on staff morale dur­ing this pe­riod found that 80 per cent of them are cop­ing well. “The other 20 per cent were not cop­ing well due to ad­just­ments they have had to make to con­tinue work­ing, ei­ther at home or in the of­fice,” says Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>Among their con­cerns are the fear of con­tract­ing the virus while trav­el­ling to work and not hav­ing a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment to work in at home.</p>
    <p>Since 2011, the bank has pro­vided a men­tal health­care hot­line manned by men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als from the Health Pro­mo­tion Board and an­other hot­line by In­ter­na­tional SOS of­fer­ing emo­tional sup­port. Calls have in­creased dur­ing the pan­demic, says Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>Dr Kang says stress and fears amid the pan­demic may af­fect an em­ployee’s per­for­mance, caus­ing in­creased er­rors, re­duced mo­ti­va­tion, pro­duc­tiv­ity and the plea­sure de­rived from work.</p>
    <p>“Men­tal health im­pacts pro­duc­tiv­ity and, in the long run, phys­i­cal well-be­ing. Re­duced men­tal and phys­i­cal well-be­ing is re­lated to higher rates of ab­sen­teeism from work,” says Dr Kang.</p>
    <p>“This is re­lated to the amount of money that com­pa­nies spend on med­i­cal and phar­macy costs for em­ploy­ees.”</p>
    <p>She adds that this could be eased if em­pha­sis is placed on cre­at­ing work­places that sup­port psy­cho­log­i­cal well-be­ing and if em­ploy­ees seek pro­fes­sional sup­port for their men­tal health needs.</p>
    <p>Dr Neo high­lights the need to pri­ori­tise men­tal health as em­ploy­ees re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>“Main­tain­ing good men­tal health in the work­place will pro­vide em­ploy­ees with a more se­cure sense of emo­tional safety, and which will en­cour­age them to seek sup­port if and when it is re­quired.</p>
    <p>“This helps de­crease the long­stand­ing stigma as­so­ci­ated with men­tal health and will as­sist those who are strug­gling to come for­ward to get proper help.”</p>
