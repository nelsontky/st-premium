    <p>Gold shops have seen a drop in cus­tomers of at least 30 per cent as gold prices surge to record highs, with one jew­eller in Lit­tle In­dia say­ing this is the “low­est point” in the store’s 25 years of oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ramanathan Palaniappa­n, di­rec­tor of APJ Abi­raame in Seran­goon Road, told The Sun­day Times: “The num­ber of walk-in cus­tomers has dropped a lot, and even if they do come in, they are buy­ing smaller amounts of gold – for ex­am­ple, only 5g in­stead of 10g. The price of gold has soared too much, so cus­tomers buy only what they need, for wed­dings or func­tions.”</p>
    <p>Gold prices soared past the key US$2,000 mark for the first time in his­tory on Tues­day as a rise in Covid-19 cases in the United States dashed hopes of a swift US eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The price has also been driven up by con­cerns over ten­sions be­tween China and the US.</p>
    <p>Gold is tra­di­tion­ally con­sid­ered a safe haven as­set by in­vestors in times of un­cer­tainty and cri­sis, such as the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But Mr Palaniappa­n said: “In­vestors might be buy­ing more gold, but for reg­u­lar shop­pers, gold is be­com­ing very ex­pen­sive. For us as busi­ness own­ers, it is very chal­leng­ing, too, be­cause the gold prices shoot up so quickly that it is hard to make busi­ness plans. It’s hard to tell how much stock to or­der and keep.”</p>
    <p>Mr Dheeraj Got­timukkala, busi­ness devel­op­ment man­ager for the Mal­abar Gold & Di­a­monds chain in Sin­ga­pore, said that both of its out­lets are get­ting only about a third of their usual num­ber of cus­tomers be­fore Covid-19 hit.</p>
    <p>He said: “Al­ready, the econ­omy is not do­ing well, so peo­ple don’t come out and shop, and now gold prices are so high. Out of 100 cus­tomers, 100 of them will com­plain that it’s too ex­pen­sive.”</p>
    <p>On the flip side, own­ers of gold pieces are now able to play the role of the price set­ter at pawn shops.</p>
    <p>Mr Tony Wong, a val­uer work­ing for the Soon Yi Pawn­shop chain, said that he has seen an uptick in the num­ber of cus­tomers pop­ping into the Jurong West out­let with gold or­na­ments over the past week, but not all of them even­tu­ally let go of the items.</p>
    <p>He said: “The cus­tomers can­not agree on the price. They be­lieve that they can get higher value for their gold at other shops. Now that gold prices are so high, they also know how to cal­cu­late.”</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Ho, di­rec­tor of Heng Seng Pawn­shop in Toa Payoh, said that the store has seen more cus­tomers sell­ing off their gold pieces in re­cent weeks. “Cus­tomers who owned these pieces for a long time are now let­ting go of their gold for a good profit.”</p>
    <p>In­vestors might be buy­ing more gold, but for reg­u­lar shop­pers, gold is be­com­ing very ex­pen­sive. For us as busi­ness own­ers, it is very chal­leng­ing, too, be­cause the gold prices shoot up so quickly that it is hard to make busi­ness plans.</p>
