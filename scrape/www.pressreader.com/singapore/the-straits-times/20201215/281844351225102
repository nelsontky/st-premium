    <p>•</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the United States Elec­toral Col­lege were yesterday set to gather in their re­spec­tive states to cast their of­fi­cial bal­lots for pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Or­di­nar­ily, the process is lit­tle more than a for­mal duty to rub­ber-stamp the re­sults of the Novem­ber elec­tion. Not this year.</p>
    <p>For weeks, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his al­lies have pres­sured Repub­li­can of­fi­cials to ig­nore the pop­u­lar vote i n close-fought states won by Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den and ap­point their own elec­tors who would favour Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>They have also asked courts to hand vic­tory to the Pres­i­dent in states he lost.</p>
    <p>But judges and Repub­li­can state law­mak­ers have shown lit­tle ap­petite for sub­vert­ing the demo­cratic process.</p>
    <p>HOW DOES THE ELEC­TORAL COL­LEGE VOT­ING SYS­TEM WORK?</p>
    <p>The elec­tors cast their votes for pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent via pa­per bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia le­gally re­quire their elec­tors to choose who­ever won the state’s pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>The other 17 states do not “bind” their elec­tors, mean­ing they can vote for whomever they choose.</p>
    <p>The elec­tors were cho­sen by state par­ties, mean­ing, if Mr Bi­den won a state, for ex­am­ple, the Democrats’ slate of elec­tors casts the votes.</p>
    <p>WHAT HAP­PENS NEXT?</p>
    <p>Congress of­fi­cially counts the votes in a joint ses­sion held in the House Chamber on Jan 6, with Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence pre­sid­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence opens the cer­tifi­cates of the vot­ing re­sults from each state and presents them to four “tell­ers”, two from the House and two from the Se­nate, who count the votes.</p>
    <p>When Mr Bi­den reaches a ma­jor­ity with 270 votes, Mr Pence an­nounces the re­sult.</p>
    <p>The ses­sion can­not be ended un­til the count is com­plete and the re­sult pub­licly de­clared. At this point, the elec­tion is of­fi­cially de­cided.</p>
    <p>The only re­main­ing task is the in­au­gu­ra­tion on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>WHICH CONGRESS RUNS THE PROCESS?</p>
    <p>Since the new mem­bers will be sworn in on Jan 3, the next Congress will con­duct this joint ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Democrats will hold con­trol of the House.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans will con­trol the Se­nate, re­gard­less of the re­sults of the Ge­or­gia run-off elec­tions on Jan 5, be­cause Mr Pence will still be in of­fice to act as the tie-break­ing vote if the Chamber is split 50-50.</p>
    <p>CAN CONGRESS MEM­BERS BLOCK THE RE­SULTS?</p>
    <p>No de­bate is per­mit­ted dur­ing the count­ing of the elec­toral votes. But af­ter the re­sult is read, Congress mem­bers get one op­por­tu­nity to lodge their con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Any ob­jec­tion to a state’s re­sults must be made in writing and be signed by at least one sen­a­tor and one mem­ber of the House. The two Cham­bers then sep­a­rate to de­bate the ob­jec­tion.</p>
    <p>Each mem­ber of Congress can speak only once – for five min­utes – and af­ter two hours, the de­bate is cut off.</p>
    <p>Each body then votes on whether to re­ject the state’s re­sults.</p>
    <p>CAN CONGRESS CHANGE THE OUT­COME?</p>
    <p>Stop­ping Mr Bi­den from as­sum­ing of­fice re­mains a long-shot strat­egy for Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>For an ob­jec­tion to stand, it must pass both Houses of Congress by a sim­ple ma­jor­ity. If the vote fol­lowed party lines, Repub­li­cans could not block Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Democrats con­trol the House, so an ob­jec­tion would al­ready be doomed there.</p>
    <p>In the Se­nate, Democrats would need to pick off only a cou­ple of Repub­li­cans to side with them to vote down the ob­jec­tion. A num­ber of Repub­li­can sen­a­tors have al­ready de­clared Mr Bi­den the pres­i­dent-elect.</p>
