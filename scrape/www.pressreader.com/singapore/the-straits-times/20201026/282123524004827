    <p>When Mr Rahim Is­lam first ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore in 1999, there were just two MRT lines – the NorthSouth and East-West lines.</p>
    <p>Then 19, he had left his sin­gle mother and two sis­ters in a rented house in Dhaka, Bangladesh, for a job earn­ing $600 a month as a con­struc­tion worker. The plan was to re­turn home in five years.</p>
    <p>Now, 21 years later, he works as a safety co­or­di­na­tor and earns $4,000. He owns three prop­er­ties and a plot of land back home.</p>
    <p>The rent from two of his prop­er­ties is enough to sup­port his wife and four-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“What I get from my salary now, I keep for in­vest­ment,” said the 40-year-old, who has be­gun to watch farm­ing tu­to­ri­als on YouTube. He plans to go home in three years to run his own fish, dairy and poul­try farms.</p>
    <p>Close to a mil­lion work per­mit hold­ers work in Sin­ga­pore in hopes of a bet­ter fu­ture for them­selves and their fam­i­lies back home.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Rahim, some of them end up ded­i­cat­ing nearly half of their lives here to achiev­ing that dream.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Mr Rahim has also in­vested in his own ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing quit school at 14, he has signed up for cour­ses ev­ery year since 2006. Most re­cently, he ob­tained a spe­cial­ist diploma in ar­chi­tec­tural tech­nol­ogy from the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity Acad­emy, adding to his list of qual­i­fi­ca­tions that in­clude ba­sic IT skills, work­place lit­er­acy and nu­mer­acy, work­place safety and health and en­vi­ron­men­tal con­trol.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery year, I up­grade my­self,” he said, as he flipped through his cer­tifi­cates. He has spent close to $20,000 in to­tal on im­prov­ing him­self.</p>
    <p>But this has come to a halt due to Covid-19. In­stead of at­tend­ing a safety of­fi­cer course, Mr Rahim found him­self un­der lock­down with a mal­func­tion­ing lap­top and a bro­ken In­ter­net con­nec­tion. And the course was post­poned.</p>
    <p>He was left with only his old text­books to pass the time.</p>
    <p>More than ever, he misses his wife and daugh­ter. This is the first time in five years that Mr Rahim has not gone home to cel­e­brate Eid alAdha, or Hari Raya Haji.</p>
    <p>“I am wor­ried about them be­cause the sit­u­a­tion is worse in Bangladesh,” he said, adding that cases in the coun­try are still in­creas­ing. “I pray for them ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>As much as he would like to stay in Sin­ga­pore, the lack of a per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) sta­tus makes it dif­fi­cult to stay long-term, said the S Pass holder. He ap­plied to be a PR in 2015 but was un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>A SIN­GA­POREAN AT HEART</p>
    <p>Mr Sub­bu­rayan Palanivelu, 45, counts him­self as one of the luck­ier ones.</p>
    <p>Af­ter get­ting a Na­tional Tech­ni­cal Cer­tifi­cate Grade 2 qual­i­fi­ca­tion, which cer­ti­fied him as a trained and com­pe­tent crafts­man in pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing, the In­dian na­tional was given PR sta­tus in 2004, af­ter just four years in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“With PR, life is much bet­ter. I can change jobs, rent a house, leave Sin­ga­pore and come back any time.”</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of three goes back to Chen­nai three times a year to visit his wife and chil­dren, aged nine, seven and five, but never for long.</p>
    <p>“I was born in In­dia, but re­ally,</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is my home.”</p>
    <p>Since he came here, his fam­ily has moved from the vil­lage to the city and gone from rent­ing a house to own­ing one.</p>
    <p>“When I go back to In­dia, my rel­a­tives and neigh­bours all give me re­spect, be­cause I work in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>But all of this comes at a price. For a monthly in­come of $4,000, Mr Sub­bu­rayan sleeps only two to three hours a day.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity su­per­vi­sor first does a 12-hour shift, then works part-time at his friend’s food stall. This leaves him time to sleep from only 4pm to 7pm. He has sus­tained this for nearly five years and is work­ing to­wards start­ing a business that he can even­tu­ally pass down to his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“I know my health con­di­tion. I still have the en­ergy,” he said. “Maybe in an­other two to five years, I will cut down the work­ing hours. But now, I can still do it.”</p>
    <p>He plans to work in Sin­ga­pore un­til his chil­dren grad­u­ate from univer­sity in an­other 10 years.</p>
    <p>HELP­ING OTH­ERS FROM HERE</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion su­per­vi­sor Hos­sain Sha­ha­dat, 32, not only sup­ports his</p>
    <p>fam­ily, but also plans to build up a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion with 11 of his child­hood friends to help the poor and needy in Cu­milla, Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>Since 2011, Mr Hos­sain has been putting aside $16, or 5 per cent of his monthly spend­ing, ev­ery month as cap­i­tal for the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Although he and his friends have not yet ac­cu­mu­lated enough to fund large-scale projects, they have started to pro­vide food and clothes on spe­cial oc­ca­sions, like Eid al-Adha.</p>
    <p>He con­sid­ers him­self for­tu­nate to be able to earn a liv­ing here, so he wants to help those who do not have the chance.</p>
    <p>But Covid-19 has put a strain on his fi­nances. His monthly salary of $1,300 was cut to $400 dur­ing the lock­down and was barely enough to cover his liv­ing ex­penses.</p>
    <p>While he usu­ally sends home $1,000 ev­ery month, he could af­ford only $200 in the months with no work.</p>
    <p>“It is a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion for everybody ev­ery­where,” he said.</p>
