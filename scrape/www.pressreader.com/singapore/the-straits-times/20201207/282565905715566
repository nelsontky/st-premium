    <p>Only three points sep­a­rated the top two sides as the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) ti­tle race was de­cided only on the fi­nal day last Satur­day, and the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore Awards Night looks set to be just as keenly con­tested to­day.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, with a col­lec­tion of stars in their squad, Lion City Sailors pro­duced two of the three nom­i­nees – Stipe Plaz­i­bat and Gabriel Quak – for the Player of the Year award de­spite fin­ish­ing be­hind cham­pi­ons Al­birex Ni­igata and Tampines Rovers in the SPL. White Swans for­ward To­moyuki Doi is the third can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional coach Noor Ali’s pick for the top prize is his for­mer player Quak, as he said: “To­moyuki stepped up and was more prom­i­nent in the sec­ond half of the sea­son, and Stipe was do­ing his goalscor­ing job re­ally well be­fore he got in­jured.</p>
    <p>“But Gabriel was the one who did more through­out the sea­son with a more all-round game. I coached him at Gey­lang in 2017, and the Thai­land stint he had in 2018 re­ally changed him men­tally, and he has be­come a dif­fer­ent player af­ter that.”</p>
    <p>Foot­ball con­sul­tant Khairul Asyraf also tipped Quak to win, but saw the mer­its of the other two nom­i­nees.</p>
    <p>He added: “Stipe found a new lease of life af­ter be­ing re­verted to his No. 9 position in­stead of the mid­field role he played at Hougang last year. As a ref­er­ence point, he went back to do­ing what he does best – scor­ing lots of goals to be­come the league’s top scorer.</p>
    <p>“Doi also did well to get into dou­ble fig­ures, but as an in­side for­ward, he is a dif­fer­ent player from Stipe, who has been a fox in the box.”</p>
    <p>HE’S THE MAN</p>
    <p>While the Coach of the Year award fea­tures three nom­i­nees in Al­birex’s Keiji Shige­tomi, Tampines’ Gavin Lee and the Sailors’ Aure­lio Vid­mar, lo­cal foot­ball ob­servers feel it will be a twohorse race be­tween the Ja­panese and the Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>Khairul is plump­ing for Lee, whom he feels did well with a lim­ited bud­get com­pared to Vid­mar, who helmed the bet­ter-re­sourced Sailors.</p>
    <p>He added: “Gavin has shown his tac­ti­cal ma­tu­rity and flex­i­bil­ity this sea­son, tog­gling flu­idly be­tween a back three and a back four. This sea­son, his team were more mea­sured and dis­ci­plined, and you see them de­fend­ing bet­ter in the mid­dle blocks, with play­ers like Jor­dan Webb com­ing back to de­fend in­stead of wait­ing for the ball to tran­si­tion into at­tack.</p>
    <p>“Other than that, what many don’t see is how well he has timed the train­ing load in the dif­fer­ent phases of this coro­n­avirus-af­fected sea­son – there were not many mus­cle in­juries in his team de­spite the packed sched­ule.”</p>
    <p>Hougang United coach Cle­ment Teo had kind words for Shige­tomi, but also leaned to­wards Lee, who was the only coach to crack Al­birex and mas­ter­mind the dou­ble over the White Swans this sea­son.</p>
    <p>He said: “Shige­tomi is a ded­i­cated coach who uses his play­ers ac­cord­ing to their strengths and man­ages to get the best out of a bunch of young play­ers, some of whom were just univer­sity play­ers with­out pro­fes­sional foot­ball ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“He also has tricks up his tac­ti­cal sleeve – Hiroyoshi Ka­mata was an at­tacker last sea­son and played at left-back this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“But Gavin edges it for me be­cause of how he has stuck to his phi­los­o­phy, got his play­ers to buy in and cre­ated an iden­tity of pos­s­e­sion-based, pass­ing foot­ball at Tampines. They ran Al­birex close, but were un­lucky to drop points else­where.</p>
    <p>“In any case, Gavin def­i­nitely rep­re­sents the fu­ture of lo­cal coaches.”</p>
    <p>But for Balestier Khalsa coach Marko Kral­je­vic, who won the Sin­ga­pore Cup and Coach of the Year gong in 2014, the award has to go to the Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>He said: “Shige­tomi recog­nised that fit­ness was key and worked on that, his team were at least 20 per cent fit­ter than any­one else, and he man­aged to in­stil pro­fes­sion­al­ism and team­work in his play­ers that took them to the next level.</p>
    <p>“He de­serves the award be­cause he led a group, that in my opin­ion were not the best team in the league, to win the ti­tle; he made things hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>The other awards that will be pre­sented at the cer­e­mony in­clude the SPL Team of the Year, Goal of the Year, best ref­eree and as­sis­tant ref­eree.</p>
    <p>Gabriel was the one who did more through­out the sea­son with a more all-round game.</p>
    <p>NOOR ALI, Gey­lang coach, is back­ing his for­mer player to clinch the top prize at the FAS Awards Night.</p>
