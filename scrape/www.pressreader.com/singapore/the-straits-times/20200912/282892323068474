    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish ac­tress Diana Rigg, who en­thralled Lon­don and New York the­atre au­di­ences with her per­for­mances in clas­sic roles for more than half a cen­tury, but re­mained best known as the quin­tes­sen­tial “new wo­man” of the 1960s – sexy, con­fi­dent, witty and karate-adept – on the tele­vi­sion se­ries The Avengers (1961 to 1969), died on Thurs­day at her home in Lon­don. She was 82.</p>
    <p>Her daugh­ter, Rachael Stir­ling, said in a state­ment that the cause was can­cer.</p>
    <p>Rigg had late-ca­reer success in a re­cur­ring role from 2013 to 2016 as the out­spo­ken and de­mand­ing Lady Olenna Tyrell on HBO’s ac­claimed se­ries Game Of Thrones (2011 to last year).</p>
    <p>But her first and big­gest taste of star­dom came in 1965, when, as a 26-year-old vet­eran of the Royal Shake­speare Com­pany, she was cast in the fourth sea­son of Bri­tish net­work ITV’s The Avengers.</p>
    <p>As Emma Peel, she was the stylish crime-fight­ing part­ner of in­tel­li­gence agent John Steed (Pa­trick Mac­nee), re­plac­ing Honor Black­man, who had left to star in the James Bond film Goldfin­ger (1964). Black­man died in April.</p>
    <p>Al­though Mrs Peel, as Steed ad­dressed her, was on the show rel­a­tively briefly, she quickly be­came the star at­trac­tion, es­pe­cially when The Avengers was first broad­cast in the United States in 1966.</p>
    <p>Rigg left the show in 1967 for a lu­mi­nous ca­reer in fea­ture films. Her other roles in­cluded He­lena in A Mid­sum­mer Night’s Dream (1968) and Por­tia in an all-star ver­sion of Julius Cae­sar (1970).</p>
    <p>But it was for an ac­tion role that she re­ceived the great­est at­ten­tion, when she played a crime boss’ daugh­ter i n On Her Majesty’s Se­cret Ser­vice (1969), the only Bond film to star Ge­orge Lazenby.</p>
    <p>Her char­ac­ter had the dis­tinc­tion among Agent 007’s movie love in­ter­ests of ac­tu­ally mar­ry­ing Bond, but she was killed off in the fi­nal scene for the sake of fu­ture plot lines.</p>
    <p>Wher­ever Rigg went, honours seemed to fol­low. She re­ceived the 1994 Tony Award for best ac­tress in a play for her per­for­mance in the ti­tle role of Medea.</p>
    <p>In Lon­don, though, she had al­ready re­ceived the Evening Stan­dard The­atre Award for the same role – an hon­our she re­ceived again in 1996 for Amer­i­can play­wright Ed­ward Al­bee’s Who’s Afraid Of Vir­ginia Woolf as well as Ger­man play­wright Ber­tolt Brecht’s Mother Courage And Her Chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Rigg never won the Olivier Award – Lon­don’s Tony equiv­a­lent – but was nom­i­nated thrice: for Mother Courage (1996), Vir­ginia Woolf (1997) and Bri­tan­ni­cus/Phe­dre (1999).</p>
    <p>Her most no­table Bri­tish screen award was a 1990 Best Ac­tress hon­our from Bafta, the Bri­tish film and tele­vi­sion academy, for Mother Love (1989), a BBC minis­eries in which she played a mur­der­ously pos­ses­sive par­ent.</p>
    <p>From 1967 to 2018, she was nom­i­nated for nine Emmy Awards, in­clud­ing four for Game Of Thrones. She won in 1997 as Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress in a minis­eries or spe­cial for her role in a Bri­tish-Ger­man pro­duc­tion of Re­becca (1997), based on the Daphne du Mau­rier novel of the same name.</p>
    <p>Born Enid Diana El­iz­a­beth Rigg on July 20, 1938, in Don­caster, York­shire, she was the daugh­ter of a rail­road en­gi­neer who soon moved his fam­ily to In­dia for a job with the na­tional rail­way.</p>
    <p>She re­turned to Eng­land when she was eight to at­tend board­ing school and re­mained in the coun­try to com­plete her ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Rigg en­tered the Royal Academy of Dra­matic Art at 17 and made her pro­fes­sional de­but two years later, in 1957, in Brecht’s drama The Cau­casian Chalk Cir­cle.</p>
    <p>As a mem­ber of the Royal Shake­speare Com­pany (1959 to 1964), she be­gan in mi­nor parts and ad­vanced to meatier ones, in­clud­ing Lady Mac­duff in Mac­beth and Bianca in The Tam­ing Of The Shrew.</p>
    <p>Rigg was made a Com­man­der of the Or­der of the Bri­tish Em­pire in 1988 and a Dame Com­man­der in 1994.</p>
    <p>Both of her mar­riages – to Me­nachem Gu­ef­fen, an Is­raeli artist (1973 to 1976), and to Archibald Ster­ling, a Scot­tish busi­ness­man and the­atre pro­ducer (1982 to 1990) – ended in di­vorce.</p>
    <p>Rachael, Rigg’s sur­viv­ing daugh­ter from her sec­ond mar­riage, is also an ac­tress. Rigg is also sur­vived by a grand­son.</p>
