    <p>A Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) den­tistry stu­dent, who tried to stran­gle his for­mer girl­friend when she re­fused to re­sume their re­la­tion­ship, is fac­ing on­go­ing dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings by the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He is cur­rently sus­pended and is not al­lowed on cam­pus, NUS said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day. The univer­sity did not say when he was sus­pended.</p>
    <p>The state­ment from NUS comes af­ter the stu­dent, Yin Zi Qin, 23, was handed com­mu­nity-based sen­tences last Fri­day by the court af­ter plead­ing guilty to one charge of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt, with an­other charge of crim­i­nal tres­pass taken into con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity-based sen­tences are non-jail sen­tences in­tro­duced in 2010 that give the courts more op­tions in sen­tenc­ing of­fend­ers for mi­nor of­fences, so that the pun­ish­ment fits the of­fence bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers will re­tain no crim­i­nal records for the of­fence if the sen­tence is suc­cess­fully com­pleted.</p>
    <p>Yin was given a short de­ten­tion or­der for 12 days, and a day re­port­ing or­der for five months, whereby of­fend­ers have to re­port to a cen­tre for mon­i­tor­ing and coun­selling as well as un­dergo re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>He was also given an or­der to com­plete 80 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice over a year.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing this, two pe­ti­tions be­gan cir­cu­lat­ing on­line, with one call­ing for a harsher sen­tence for the stu­dent and an­other call­ing for NUS to ex­pel the stu­dent.</p>
    <p>As of last night, the first pe­ti­tion had gar­nered more than 11,000 sig­na­tures, while the other had more than 13,000 sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>In its post, NUS said it does not have the ju­ris­dic­tion to in­ves­ti­gate mat­ters be­yond the univer­sity, not­ing that the in­ci­dent oc­curred of­f­cam­pus.</p>
    <p>“In this par­tic­u­lar in­ci­dent, NUS had to wait for the com­ple­tion of court pro­ceed­ings to gather the facts of the case, be­fore ini­ti­at­ing the dis­ci­plinary process,” said the univer­sity, adding that it is pro­ceed­ing with the dis­ci­plinary mat­ter as quickly as it can.</p>
    <p>NUS also said it “stands strongly against any form of mis­con­duct”, adding that stu­dents who have breached NUS statutes and reg­u­la­tions face se­vere sanc­tions, in­clud­ing sus­pen­sion and ex­pul­sion.</p>
    <p>The state­ment added: “We have also very re­cently dis­cov­ered that the vic­tim in this case, who was not an NUS stu­dent at the time of the in­ci­dent, is now a mem­ber of our com­mu­nity. With this new knowl­edge, a strict no-con­tact or­der has been is­sued to en­sure the safety of the vic­tim.”</p>
    <p>NUS added that the vic­tim’s school is in con­tact with the vic­tim, and has ex­tended sup­port and as­sis­tance to her. The school is work­ing closely with the NUS Vic­tim Care Unit.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Yin was in his sec­ond year of a den­tal course at NUS and had dated the 21-year-old vic­tim for al­most two years at the time of the of­fence.</p>
    <p>In May last year, the vic­tim broke up with Yin over What­sApp, and he later en­tered her home with an ac­cess card she had pre­vi­ously given him.</p>
    <p>She re­turned home to meet him, and they en­tered her bed­room to­gether by climb­ing in through her win­dow from an ad­ja­cent show­room unit.</p>
    <p>Yin pleaded with her not to end their re­la­tion­ship, but she re­fused. He then hit his own head against the wall and re­mained silent for a while.</p>
    <p>Yin then said he was up­set, and later sud­denly placed his hands on the vic­tim’s neck and tried to stran­gle her.</p>
    <p>Af­ter she strug­gled, he re­leased his grip and pressed his thumb against her eye, caus­ing it to bleed. She later blacked out.</p>
    <p>Her vi­sion was tem­po­rar­ily im­paired, with a pro­longed eye in­fec­tion that took five months to re­solve.</p>
    <p>Last Au­gust, the vic­tim re­ported that she did not suf­fer any per­ma­nent in­juries, apart from a few scars on her neck.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment, District Judge Marvin Bay noted that the vic­tim suf­fered a de­gree of psy­cho­log­i­cal harm from the in­ci­dent, which she said caused her to suf­fer from in­som­nia and night­mares of Yin break­ing into her house or as­sault­ing her.</p>
    <p>But the district judge said he was sat­is­fied that Yin was not at high risk of re-of­fend­ing.</p>
    <p>He added that while it was plain to him that pro­ba­tion would not be ap­pro­pri­ate, Yin’s rel­a­tive youth, re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive prospects and lack of pre­vi­ous con­vic­tions made com­mu­nity based-sen­tences a vi­able op­tion, rather than a con­ven­tional jail sen­tence.</p>
    <p>For vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt, Yin could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000.</p>
