    <p>PARIS • No­vak Djokovic, who was fa­mously de­faulted at the US Open af­ter he ac­ci­den­tally hit a ball which felled a line judge, has de­manded that the of­fi­cials be re­placed by ma­chines.</p>
    <p>The world No. 1 was dis­qual­i­fied at Flush­ing Mead­ows af­ter his stray ball smashed into the throat of a lineswoman stand­ing be­hind him.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent hap­pened at Arthur Ashe Sta­dium, one of just two courts at the US Open which still main­tains the tra­di­tion of us­ing lines­men and women.</p>
    <p>Elec­tronic line call­ing was used on the other courts as part of plans to re­duce the num­ber of peo­ple on-site dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There have been grow­ing calls for a sim­i­lar sys­tem to be in­tro­duced at Roland Gar­ros, which still re­lies on of­fi­cials mak­ing rul­ings with the naked eye.</p>
    <p>Djokovic be­lieves it is time for a re­think. “With all re­spect for the tra­di­tion and the cul­ture we have in this sport, when it comes to peo­ple present on the court dur­ing a match, in­clud­ing line um­pires, I re­ally don’t see a rea­son why ev­ery sin­gle tour­na­ment in this world, in this tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vanced era, would not have what we had dur­ing Cincin­nati/New York,” he said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>He has ear­lier de­mol­ished Colom­bian lucky loser Daniel Galan 6-0, 6-3, 6-2 to reach the last 16, where he will face Rus­sian 15th seed Karen Khachanov.</p>
    <p>“The tech­nol­ogy is so ad­vanced right now, there is ab­so­lutely no rea­son why you should keep line um­pires on the court.</p>
    <p>“Of course, I un­der­stand tech­nol­ogy is ex­pen­sive, so it’s an eco­nom­i­cal is­sue and a ques­tion mark.</p>
    <p>“But I feel like we are all mov­ing to­wards that, and sooner or later, there is no rea­son to keep line um­pires.</p>
    <p>“Maybe you can tell me if there is any sig­nif­i­cant rea­son why we should keep other than tra­di­tion that we had and have in this sport. Then I would also prob­a­bly then have less chances to do what I did in New York.”</p>
    <p>Top play­ers such as US Open cham­pion Do­minic Thiem and Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas have also called for a re­think of of­fi­ci­at­ing in Paris this week.</p>
