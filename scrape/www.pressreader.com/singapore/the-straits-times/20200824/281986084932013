    <p>The fam­ily of the boy who drowned at Changi Beach Park last Satur­day did not know that he had gone to the beach, a rel­a­tive told The Straits Times yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>They had thought that 14-yearold Putera Muham­mad In­dra Shazrine Suzaini had gone to study with friends and were shocked when they got the call in­form­ing them that the Sec­ondary 2 boy had drowned, said the boy’s step-grand­uncle.</p>
    <p>“He was a very quiet boy, didn’t like to talk. But he was very good to his mother and fa­ther,” Mr Noor Az­man Marwi, 56, a trans­port com­pany owner, told ST at the Singapore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal morgue.</p>
    <p>“I saw him dur­ing gath­er­ings or when­ever I vis­ited their home,” he said, adding that Putera would some­times tag along with his step­fa­ther for events or­gan­ised by a mo­tor­cy­cle char­ity club, where both men are mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to eye­wit­nesses who posted on­line about the in­ci­dent, Putera was part of a group of about six boys who had gone fish­ing and swim­ming at Changi Beach Park.</p>
    <p>Con­do­lences poured in on­line for Putera’s mother, Lynn Boyan Pu­tra.</p>
    <p>She de­clined to speak to the me­dia at the morgue yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>On the day of the in­ci­dent, she had gone to the scene of her son’s death af­ter re­ceiv­ing calls from the po­lice and her son’s friends.</p>
    <p>She had told Shin Min Daily News that her son was obe­di­ent and well­be­haved, but also timid – so she was taken aback when she re­ceived a call from her son’s school­mate about the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>She also told Chi­nese evening daily Lianhe Wan­bao that her son did not know how to swim.</p>
    <p>The teenager’s body was found in the wa­ters off Changi Beach Park by res­cuers from the Singapore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) at around 3.30pm last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>When SCDF of­fi­cers first ar­rived at the scene, they found one per­son on the shore who was later taken to Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Divers from the SCDF’s Dis­as­ter As­sis­tance and Res­cue Team per­formed an un­der­wa­ter search for Putera, who was later found about 15m from the shore and pro­nounced dead at the scene by a para­medic.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the un­nat­u­ral death.</p>
    <p>Putera’s step­fa­ther, Mr Pu­tra Muhd Arffi, 40, said the teenager was the oldest of three boys, the other two be­ing aged 13 and one.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know much about what hap­pened, I just know he was there with some of his friends from school,” said Mr Pu­tra, who works in pest con­trol.</p>
    <p>“I also know there were some fish­er­men nearby who also tried to help in the res­cue,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, more than 50 fam­ily mem­bers and friends gath­ered at Putera’s fam­ily home in Yishun as well as at the build­ing’s void deck.</p>
    <p>He was later buried at about 4pm at Choa Chu Kang Ceme­tery.</p>
    <p>A QUIET BOY</p>
    <p>He was a very quiet boy, didn’t like to talk. But he was very good to his mother and fa­ther. I saw him dur­ing gath­er­ings or when­ever I vis­ited their home.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
