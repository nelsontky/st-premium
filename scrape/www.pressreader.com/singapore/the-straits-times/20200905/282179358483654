    <p>The Repub­lic is push­ing back in the fight against dengue, with a 20 per cent drop in cases in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>About 84 per cent of the 2,253 clus­ters re­ported this year were also closed as at the end of last month, said Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the large clus­ters in Bart­ley Road, Tampines Av­enue 7, Cas­sia Cres­cent, Dakota Cres­cent, Leicester Road, Po­tong Pasir Av­enue 1 and Brad­dell Road.</p>
    <p>But Ms Fu cau­tioned in her writ­ten re­ply to par­lia­men­tary ques­tions that the over­all num­ber of dengue cases still re­mains high, and that Sin­ga­pore can­not af­ford to let its guard down.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is in its worst dengue out­break, with 27,280 cases as at the end of last month. In con­trast, the whole of 2013 – the year of the Repub­lic’s pre­vi­ous worst out­break – saw 22,170 cases.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu said many steps have been taken to fight dengue, in­clud­ing in­ten­sive en­force­ment and in­spec­tion regimes, which in­volved 107,000 in­spec­tions of homes, as well as the de­struc­tion of about 5,300 mosquito breed­ing habi­tats in May and June alone.</p>
    <p>Aside from this, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency has part­nered with var­i­ous stake­hold­ers and agen­cies to dis­trib­ute more than one mil­lion bot­tles of in­sect re­pel­lent to stu­dents and res­i­dents i n ac­tive dengue clus­ters, and sus­pected dengue pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Project Wol­bachia has also shown promis­ing re­sults, said Ms Fu. This in­volves the re­lease of male mos­qui­toes car­ry­ing the Wol­bachia bac­terium in cer­tain ar­eas of Sin­ga­pore. Fe­male Aedes ae­gypti mos­qui­toes that mate with such males lay eggs that do not hatch, thus sup­press­ing the mosquito pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu said that the Aedes ae­gypti pop­u­la­tions in Yishun and Tampines, two of the project’s lo­ca­tions, have been sup­pressed by 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>A pre­lim­i­nary anal­y­sis also found 65 per cent to 80 per cent fewer dengue cases at the study sites, com­pared with ar­eas where Wol­bachi­acar­ry­ing mos­qui­toes were not re­leased.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite the suc­cess of the tri­als, Ms Fu said that Project Wol­bachia is nei­ther a “sil­ver bul­let” in the fight against dengue, nor is it ready for im­me­di­ate de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause ef­fort is still needed to find in­no­va­tions and en­gi­neer­ing solutions to au­to­mate and sus­tain the mosquito pro­duc­tion and re­lease pro­cesses be­fore the project can be im­ple­mented on a larger scale.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, Wol­bachia tech­nol­ogy can­not re­place the com­mu­nity’s ef­forts to en­sure good house­keep­ing, which will al­ways be needed to keep our homes and es­tates free from mos­qui­toes and dengue,” said Ms Fu.</p>
    <p>She added: “The cur­rent con­di­tions are chal­leng­ing. We are still in the peak dengue sea­son and an all­out na­tional ef­fort is nec­es­sary to win the bat­tle against dengue...</p>
    <p>“I urge all res­i­dents, es­pe­cially those re­sid­ing in dengue clus­ter ar­eas, to do their part and take the three pro­tec­tive ac­tions against dengue – spray in­sec­ti­cide in dark cor­ners around the house, ap­ply in­sect re­pel­lent reg­u­larly, and wear long sleeves and long pants.”</p>
