    <p>When Ms Jenny Tan, 21, en­rolled in the Univer­sity of New­cas­tle at PSB Academy (PSBA) in Au­gust, she was the third per­son in her fam­ily to do so.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther, Mr Sunny Tan, 54, com­pleted a part-time de­gree in en­vi­ron­men­tal and oc­cu­pa­tional health and safety at the same univer­sity eight years ear­lier. Her brother, Jef­frey, 24, joined its me­chan­i­cal engi­neer­ing de­gree pro­gramme in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>Today, their fa­ther gives back to his alma mater by help­ing to or­gan­ise sem­i­nars and net­work­ing events for stu­dents. His ded­i­ca­tion has paid off for his two chil­dren. They are among some 2,500 lo­cal stu­dents, or about a fifth of the cam­pus’ stu­dent co­hort, who will ben­e­fit from PSBA’s $3 mil­lion Fu­ture To­gether ini­tia­tive this year.</p>
    <p>Un­der the ini­tia­tive, stu­dents en­rolled in se­lected cour­ses of­fered by PSBA and its part­ner uni­ver­si­ties will re­ceive fi­nan­cial re­lief in the form of tu­ition fee waivers, re­bates, fee guar­an­tees or study cred­its un­til the end of this year.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble stu­dents en­rolling from Au­gust till De­cem­ber, for in­stance, will have course fees waived for the first term if they are in se­lected cer­tifi­cate and diploma pro­grammes, and re­ceive re­bates of up to $6,000 on course fees for spe­cific un­der­grad­u­ate and post­grad­u­ate cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Some stu­dents who started their pro­grammes be­fore Au­gust will re­ceive vary­ing amounts of study cred­its to help off­set course fees.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan is among those who will re­ceive up to $6,000 in course fee re­bates. Her brother will re­ceive $1,000 in cred­its.</p>
    <p>“The ini­tia­tive is very timely dur­ing this Covid-19 pe­riod and I’m very touched by it,” said the older Mr Tan, who is now a di­rec­tor in a fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment firm.</p>
    <p>PSBA chief ex­ec­u­tive Der­rick Chang said the school is de­ter­mined to en­sure ac­cess to qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion in such try­ing times.</p>
    <p>“These times of un­cer­tain­ties come and go, but this should not af­fect a per­son’s ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Fu­ture To­gether is PSBA’s first ini­tia­tive for stu­dents de­vel­oped in re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As part of the scheme, the in­sti­tu­tion will ex­plore part­ner­ships with other in­sti­tu­tions and firms to of­fer more op­por­tu­ni­ties, such as job and in­tern­ship place­ments, to fresh and mid-ca­reer grad­u­ates.</p>
