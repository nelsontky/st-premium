    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s sec­ond­most pop­u­lous state re­ported only a small rise in new Covid-19 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, boost­ing hopes that case num­bers are sta­bil­is­ing af­ter a sec­ond wave forced the au­thor­i­ties to put the city of Mel­bourne back into lock­down.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria state, which cur­rently ac­counts for nearly all of Aus­tralia’s new cases, re­ported 331 Covid-19 in­fec­tions and 19 deaths in the past 24 hours, up from 322 in­fec­tions and the same num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties a day ear­lier, health of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Daily in­fec­tions i n Vic­to­ria peaked at 725 on Aug 5 and have been trend­ing l ower in re­cent days, fol­low­ing the im­po­si­tion of a hard lock­down in Mel­bourne on July 19.</p>
    <p>While the lock­down has caused sig­nif­i­cant eco­nomic harm, the au­thor­i­ties said the re­stric­tions that will run un­til next month are bear­ing fruit. “We con­tinue to see num­bers com­ing down. Ex­actly how long that takes and what the low­est num­ber is we can get to, only time will tell,” Vic­to­rian Pre­mier Daniel An­drews told re­porters in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>New South Wales (NSW) state re­ported 22 new cases, the big­gest one-day rise since April 17.</p>
    <p>About a third of those cases were linked to an out­break at a school in Syd­ney, the source of which re­mained un­known, NSW health of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>“It’s not al­ways pos­si­ble to de­ter­mine the source and that’s what wor­ries us most,” NSW Health Min­is­ter Brad Haz­zard said.</p>
    <p>No other cases were re­ported else­where in Aus­tralia. The coun­try has con­firmed al­most 22,000 in­fec­tions and 332 deaths from Covid-19, far fewer than many other de­vel­oped na­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Aus­tralia’s North­ern Ter­ri­tory will be closed to vis­i­tors from virus hot spots for a fur­ther 18 months to pro­tect its large and vul­ner­a­ble Abo­rig­i­nal pop­u­la­tion, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day. The sparsely pop­u­lated north­ern re­gion is home to roughly 250,000 peo­ple – 30 per cent of whom are Abo­rig­i­nal – ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment fig­ures.</p>
    <p>“We’ll have our hard bor­der con­trols in place for at least the next 18 months. And we’re re­sourc­ing so we can do that,” Chief Min­is­ter Michael Gun­ner told public broad­caster ABC.</p>
    <p>In­dige­nous Aus­tralians are con­sid­ered more at risk to diseases such as Covid-19 be­cause of so­cioe­co­nomic and cul­tural fac­tors af­fect­ing ac­cess to med­i­cal care and un­der­ly­ing health.</p>
    <p>Many Abo­rig­i­nal groups fear the virus could sweep through re­mote in­dige­nous com­mu­ni­ties where health­care ser­vices are lim­ited. “This is what I think I need to do to make sure some of the most vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple in the world stay safe,” Mr Gun­ner said.</p>
