    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) is aim­ing to raise hy­giene stan­dards and the clean­li­ness lev­els of cof­fee shop toi­lets in Sin­ga­pore (Fund­ing to im­prove toi­lets at cof­fee shops, hawker cen­tres, Oct 4).</p>
    <p>As part of the Toi­let Im­prove­ment Pro­gramme, cof­fee shop own­ers or op­er­a­tors will be en­cour­aged to re­move smok­ing cor­ners.</p>
    <p>Once re­moved, pa­trons can en­joy a bet­ter din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence with­out be­ing ex­posed to sec­ond-hand to­bacco smoke.</p>
    <p>For those who choose the op­tion to re­move, they will be sup­ported with fund­ing of up to 90 per cent (or $45,000 cap) “to ren­o­vate their toi­lets through in­fras­truc­tural im­prove­ments, and in­cor­po­rate toi­let tech­nolo­gies and pro­duc­tiv­ity mea­sures to fa­cil­i­tate clean­ing and main­te­nance in the long run”. This is well and good.</p>
    <p>I am, how­ever, dis­ap­pointed that NEA also pro­vides an­other op­tion al­low­ing cof­fee shop own­ers and op­er­a­tors to re­tain their smok­ing cor­ners. This op­tion is still sup­ported by fund­ing of up to 60 per cent (or $30,000 cap).</p>
    <p>How does this op­tion tie in with the NEA’s and the Gov­ern­ment’s drive to pro­tect non-smok­ers from ex­po­sure to sec­ond-hand smoke?</p>
    <p>When smok­ing in many pub­lic places such as void decks, bus stops, over­head bridges, cov­ered walk­ways and pub­lic parks is al­ready pro­hib­ited by law, why is smok­ing still al­lowed in cof­fee shops?</p>
    <p>For those cof­fee shop own­ers and op­er­a­tors who wish to re­tain their smok­ing cor­ner, the NEA can achieve its com­ple­men­tary ob­jec­tive of pro­tect­ing non-smok­ers from sec­ond-hand smoke by al­low­ing fund­ing sup­port, through the im­prove­ment pro­gramme, for op­er­a­tors to erect phys­i­cal par­ti­tions to sep­a­rate smok­ing and non-smok­ing sec­tions. Such par­ti­tion­ing has al­ready been done in Nee Soon South. It is a win-win sit­u­a­tion for smok­ers and non-smok­ers if cof­fee shop own­ers and op­er­a­tors choose to re­tain their smok­ing cor­ner.</p>
    <p>The erec­tion of phys­i­cal par­ti­tions should also be made manda­tory through leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>A much bet­ter out­come can be achieved by the NEA with a tweak to the fund­ing pro­gramme.</p>
