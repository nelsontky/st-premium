    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) is be­gin­ning to re­duce its pact with MSCI ear­lier than ex­pected, cit­ing mar­ket un­cer­tainty into the year-end to speed up delist­ing the largest de­riv­a­tives prod­uct it has in part­ner­ship with the in­dex provider.</p>
    <p>The ex­change will mi­grate all open po­si­tions in the MSCI Tai­wan In­dex fu­tures to its newly launched</p>
    <p>FTSE con­tracts on Oct 30, and the MSCI prod­uct will then be sus­pended, Mr Michael Syn, who as head of eq­ui­ties oversees both the cash eq­ui­ties and eq­uity de­riv­a­tives busi­nesses, said in an in­ter­view. The MSCI prod­uct had pre­vi­ously been set to wind down as of the li­cence ex­pi­ra­tion in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“There’s un­cer­tainty as to what the mar­ket should ex­pect Novem­ber on­ward be­cause of the US elec­tion” and De­cem­ber hol­i­days, Mr Syn said, adding that the delist­ing is be­ing brought for­ward to avoid po­ten­tial op­er­a­tional is­sues and “to make sure ev­ery­one’s strapped in be­fore the elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>The move comes af­ter MSCI’s de­ci­sion in May to shift in­dex li­cens­ing for some de­riv­a­tives prod­ucts from Sin­ga­pore to Hong Kong. Come Fe­bru­ary, its pact with the city-state’s ex­change will be lim­ited to prod­ucts based on MSCI’s Sin­ga­pore in­dexes. SGX has part­nered with FTSE Rus­sell to in­tro­duce new of­fer­ings and signed a broad-rang­ing deal that spans mul­ti­ple as­set classes.</p>
    <p>It pre­vi­ously es­ti­mated that delist­ing its non-Sin­ga­pore MSCI prod­ucts would im­pact net profit for its cur­rent fi­nan­cial year end­ing in June by 10 per cent to 15 per cent if no mit­i­gat­ing ac­tions were taken.</p>
    <p>The bourse in­tro­duced the SGX FTSE Tai­wan In­dex Fu­tures con­tracts in July and there is al­ready am­ple liq­uid­ity to make the move, Mr Syn said. To­tal turnover ex­ceeded US$1.5 bil­lion (S$2.04 bil­lion) in the first week of trad­ing. This is the first time an ex­change will mi­grate open in­ter­est on be­half of cus­tomers, he said.</p>
    <p>The Tai­wan con­tracts ac­counted for more than half of the vol­umes of all MSCI de­riv­a­tives prod­ucts trad­ing on the ex­change, and about 12 per cent of over­all eq­uity de­riv­a­tives vol­umes, in fis­cal year 2020. Ac­cord­ing to Mr Syn, US cus­tomers are key to the Tai­wan business, with about 26 per cent of vol­ume oc­cur­ring overnight amid de­mand from US and Euro­pean in­vestors for the tech­nol­ogy-heavy in­dex.</p>
    <p>Other high­lights from the in­ter­view:</p>
    <p>• SGX is tar­get­ing the launch of a de­riv­a­tives trad­ing link with</p>
    <p>In­dia by the end of next year. • The ex­change aims to in­tro­duce about five more fu­tures con­tracts on in­di­vid­ual stocks listed in the city-state by the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>• The bourse will also in­tro­duce more de­riv­a­tives linked to real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts and some in the en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance cat­e­gory.</p>
