    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Snow­bird­ing is the Amer­i­can pas­time of flock­ing to Florida and other sunny shores for the win­ter, usu­ally by re­tirees – but it will look dif­fer­ent this year.</p>
    <p>While travel spend­ing i n the United States is down by hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars and Europe is lock­ing down again, one corner of the world is aflut­ter with ac­tiv­ity: snow­bird groups on Face­book.</p>
    <p>“The whole coun­try has pan­demic fa­tigue,” said Ms Lisa Carter-Knight, 53, who splits her time be­tween the states of New Hamp­shire and Florida.</p>
    <p>“And now that the virus is ev­ery­where, we’re hear­ing people say, ‘Well, I might as well be some­where warm.’”</p>
    <p>Yet travel re­stric­tions and other fac­tors en­sure that the snow­bird tra­di­tion is chang­ing, and here is how.</p>
    <p>Ms Melissa Di Gi­a­como, 25, man­ages her par­ents’ twobed­room con­do­minium in Bonita Springs in Florida, and has al­ways rented to re­tirees in their 50s – un­til now. “This is the first year where we’ve got renters in their 30s with a young child – it’s a huge dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>Sibarth, a real es­tate com­pany that rents out lux­ury vil­las on St Barts, will also wel­come a dif­fer­ent mix.</p>
    <p>“Much fewer re­tirees than be­fore and more work­ing pro­fes­sion­als be­tween 40 and 60 trav­el­ling with their chil­dren,” said Ms Ash­ley La­cour, the com­pany’s pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“Some have even en­rolled their kids in the lo­cal pub­lic schools.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Ms Me­lanie Granuzzo and her hus­band locked up their home in Con­necti­cut and hit the road for the win­ter with their tod­dler daugh­ter, Amelia, and York­shire ter­rier, Win­ston.</p>
    <p>“Typ­i­cally, we avoid trav­el­ling through the hol­i­days, but this year is dif­fer­ent,” said Ms Granuzzo, 30, di­rec­tor of so­cial me­dia and edi­to­rial at a dig­i­tal agency.</p>
    <p>“As par­ents of a young child, we don’t want to be stuck in the cold,” she said. “So we might con­sider a short-term rental in Florida or Charleston.”</p>
    <p>Ms Bran­dreth Cana­ley, di­rec­tor of op­er­a­tions at Sex­tant Stays, a Mi­ami-based va­ca­tion-rentals agency, said multi-stop “South­ern swings” are a new pat­tern this year.</p>
    <p>“We’re see­ing young pro­fes­sion­als trav­el­ling around the coun­try, spend­ing a month or two in dif­fer­ent cities.</p>
    <p>“It’s one of the sur­prise op­por­tu­ni­ties of the pan­demic, for those who are able to work from home.”</p>
    <p>Ms Su­sanne Heger and her hus­band, whose pri­mary res­i­dence is in Wilde­shausen, Ger­many, will spend six months in Florida, ro­tat­ing be­tween their three homes.</p>
    <p>“It’s much eas­ier in Florida – you can have so­cial dis­tance, you stay out­side, you breathe fresh air.”</p>
    <p>For the first time, their 2,700 sq ft home in Bonita Springs will wel­come not a sin­gle Euro­pean.</p>
    <p>“All of a sud­den, we got people from Mi­ami – even the other side of Florida,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Cana­ley is also see­ing do­mes­tic guests tip the scales.</p>
    <p>She said: “In a nor­mal year, you might have fam­ily mem­bers from Latin Amer­ica or Europe com­ing over for the hol­i­days for a few weeks, whereas now we’re see­ing those book­ings come from do­mes­tic trav­ellers – a good por­tion from the North-east.”</p>

Home own&#xAD;ers rent&#xAD;ing out their Florida abodes for win&#xAD;ter are see&#xAD;ing more young people in&#xAD;stead of the usual re&#xAD;tirees.</p>
