    <p>Few na­tions are with­out dis­tress this year, but things are es­pe­cially dire in Ye­men, de­scribed as the neediest place on earth – and for good rea­son. It is the site of the world’s worst hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis, stoked by a civil war that broke out in 2014. Its econ­omy and in­fra­struc­ture are dev­as­tated by con­tin­ual bomb­ings and block­ades, leav­ing nearly two-thirds of its pop­u­la­tion of 30 mil­lion de­pen­dent on aid that has shriv­elled up as most donor na­tions ex­pe­ri­ence re­ces­sion. The World Food Pro­gramme, which re­ceived the No­bel Peace Prize last week, runs its largest op­er­a­tion there. On top of the war that has taken at least 100,000 lives, Ye­men has been stalked by dis­ease. Be­fore the coro­n­avirus en­tered the pic­ture, it had been rav­aged by cholera – some 180,000 new cases were re­ported this year – along with diph­the­ria, dengue and malaria. Covid-19, first de­tected in April, has killed 600 and in­fected over 2,000. This is likely an un­der­es­ti­mate. Test­ing fa­cil­i­ties are se­verely lack­ing and only half of the coun­try’s health cen­tres are fully op­er­a­tional. The United Na­tions says Covid-19 deaths could ex­ceed 230,000 with a death rate five times the global av­er­age.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional source of volatil­ity was the bat­tle there last year be­tween the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Al-Qaeda for ter­ri­tory and re­cruits. Even as the so-called ISIS caliphate col­lapsed, its ide­ol­ogy con­tin­ues to in­cite vi­o­lence and is a source of con­cern for gov­ern­ments from West Africa to South-east Asia. Last week, it was re­vealed that a Sin­ga­porean man had been de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act for be­ing ac­tively in­volved in the civil war in Ye­men and for work­ing as a paid agent for a for­eign power while he was there.</p>
    <p>Ye­men’s sec­tar­ian con­flict also has a strate­gic di­men­sion. A Saudi Ara­bia-led mil­i­tary coali­tion in­ter­vened in 2015 to back govern­ment forces fight­ing the coun­try’s Zaydi Shi’ite mi­nor­ity – cham­pi­oned by the Houthi move­ment, which is aligned with Riyadh’s re­gional ri­val Iran. Saudi Ara­bia acted to pre­vent Iran from ac­quir­ing a foothold on the Ara­bian penin­sula over­look­ing the strate­gic Bab el-Man­deb strait, a choke point for oil and nat­u­ral gas ship­ments.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, which has sup­ported Saudi ef­forts, is ex­pected to soon des­ig­nate the Houthi group as a “for­eign ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion”. This will ob­struct the de­liv­ery of food and medicine in rebel-held ter­ri­tory. Brand­ing the Houthis as ter­ror­ists would also tie the hands of the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, re­strict­ing its abil­ity to hold a di­a­logue with the group that con­trols most of north­ern Ye­men. A last­ing so­lu­tion will need an end to the for­eign in­ter­ven­tion and a po­lit­i­cal set­tle­ment be­tween fac­tions. Even if the war ends next year, Ye­men’s de­vel­op­ment would have been set back by 25 years.</p>
