    <p>An in­di­vid­ual’s genes can de­ter­mine the amount of risk he has of de­vel­op­ing life-threat­en­ing con­di­tions such as heart disease and, in turn, al­low for early in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Achiev­ing such out­comes is cen­tral to the pre­ci­sion medicine pro­gramme here, said Pro­fes­sor Tan Chorh Chuan, the chief health sci­en­tist of the Min­istry of Health and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of its Of­fice for Health­care Trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan told a we­bi­nar yes­ter­day that the re­search pro­gramme looks at the genome se­quences of par­tic­i­pants and how these may re­late to health. For ex­am­ple, the pres­ence of cer­tain gene mu­ta­tions could in­crease the risk of spe­cific dis­eases.</p>
    <p>This can be par­tic­u­larly use­ful for some com­plaints like pre­ma­ture heart disease, added Prof Tan, who was joined on the we­bi­nar panel by Pru­den­tial chief ex­ec­u­tive Den­nis Tan and Health Pro­mo­tion Board (HPB) CEO Zee Yoong Kang.</p>
    <p>The event, which cov­ered a broad range of health top­ics from di­a­betes and vac­cines to strate­gies on how to stay healthy, is part of The Straits Times Re­set 2021 we­bi­nar se­ries. It was spon­sored by Pru­den­tial and mod­er­ated by ST se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan told the we­bi­nar that a con­di­tion known as fa­mil­ial hy­per­c­holes­tero­laemia is caused by gene mu­ta­tions that re­sult in high choles­terol lev­els at a much younger age. The af­fected per­son may have up to 20 times higher risk of heart disease and at an ear­lier age.</p>
    <p>“And then if we iden­tify some­body, we can also test the fam­ily. So these pre­ven­ta­tive strate­gies will be part of pre­ci­sion health,” he added.</p>
    <p>The HPB is work­ing to make use of clin­i­cal, be­havioural, dig­i­tal and ge­netic data – with pa­tient con­sent – to iden­tify those at higher risk to al­low for early in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial’s Mr Tan said Sin­ga­pore­ans need not worry about be­ing part of the pro­gramme or be con­cerned about find­ing out their genome se­quences.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing “bad” genes will not make it harder for them to se­cure in­sur­ance poli­cies, he noted.</p>
    <p>Pri­vacy is re­ally im­por­tant, Mr Tan said, adding that “we (Pru­den­tial) are very, very care­ful about such things”.</p>
    <p>He said in­di­vid­u­als ul­ti­mately have to take charge of their own health and want to find out more.</p>
    <p>“Pre­ven­ta­tive health­care is all about them be­ing in the driver’s seat, and go­ing through the whole process of early de­tec­tion, health screen­ing and all.</p>
    <p>“So I think as in­sur­ers, we will def­i­nitely sup­port them.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kha­lik said that if a per­son learns that he is at high risk of a cer­tain disease, it will give him the time and op­por­tu­nity to act be­fore the ail­ment takes hold.</p>
