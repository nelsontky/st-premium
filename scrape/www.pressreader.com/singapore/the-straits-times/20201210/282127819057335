    <p>The grav­ity of the Covid-19 pan­demic truly hit home for Of­fi­cer Cadet (OCT) Is­varan Ma­hen­dran when ba­sic mil­i­tary train­ing was sus­pended for two months ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>With the pause on train­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April, his par­ents were con­cerned about his on­go­ing train­ing at the Of­fi­cer Cadet School, lo­cated at Safti Mil­i­tary In­sti­tute in Joo Koon.</p>
    <p>But they were re­as­sured when they saw the lengths that the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) took to en­sure safe train­ing, such as masks hav­ing to be worn at all times ex­cept when the cadets were in their bunks, more space be­tween cadets when march­ing from place to place, and train­ing in smaller groups.</p>
    <p>OCT Ma­hen­dran is among the 397 cadets who will be com­mis­sioned as SAF of­fi­cers on Satur­day, the first batch to have un­der­gone the en­tire 38-week train­ing dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As a sign of the times, the cadets will re­ceive their cer­e­mo­nial swords and let­ters of ap­point­ment at com­mis­sion­ing cer­e­monies or­gan­ised at the for­ma­tion level this week, in lieu of a tra­di­tional com­mis­sion­ing pa­rade at Safti Mil­i­tary In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>OCT Ma­hen­dran, 19, who is a Sword of Honour re­cip­i­ent, told re­porters last Satur­day that the in­camp safety mea­sures put his par­ents at ease, and al­lowed him to fo­cus fully on his train­ing.</p>
    <p>Four batches of of­fi­cer cadets are com­mis­sioned yearly. As part of Covid-19 mea­sures, com­mis­sion­ing pa­rades with in­vited guests have not been held for the last two batches, since June.</p>
    <p>In a recorded mes­sage at the cer­e­monies, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said that even as the men and women of the SAF and the wider de­fence com­mu­nity have sup­ported the na­tion’s fight against Covid-19, the SAF re­mains vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>Ad­just­ments have been made to train­ing ac­tiv­i­ties so that sol­diers can con­tinue to train ef­fec­tively, but with peace of mind, know­ing that ro­bust safe man­age­ment mea­sures are in place, she said.</p>
    <p>“By its ac­tions, the SAF and the de­fence com­mu­nity has sent a clear mes­sage that it is nim­ble and adapt­able, and that our peo­ple</p>
    <p>have the met­tle and re­silience in them to over­come any ad­ver­sity.”</p>
    <p>With a world that has changed sig­nif­i­cantly be­cause of Covid-19, and an un­cer­tain ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment, the SAF must con­tinue to stay ahead of the curve to re­main ef­fec­tive against an ever-ex­pand­ing ar­ray of se­cu­rity threats, she said.</p>
    <p>The value of na­tional ser­vice, too, will be­come even more salient, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s con­scrip­tion pol­icy was meant first and fore­most to de­fend the home­land, but it has over time also be­come a cor­ner­stone of its shared iden­tity as a peo­ple and a key thread in its so­cial fab­ric, she said.</p>
    <p>“The bonds that are forged through na­tional ser­vice – re­gard­less of race, lan­guage or re­li­gion – will help us stand firm against the threats of to­mor­row that seek to sow dis­cord, dis­trust and di­vi­sion,” she added.</p>
    <p>OCT Kh­wang Li Yi, a 21-year-old reg­u­lar from the Sig­nals for­ma­tion, felt that Covid-19 has had a pos­i­tive im­pact, be­cause it trained her to be more adapt­able and more self-dis­ci­plined in ad­her­ing to safe dis­tanc­ing and mask wear­ing.</p>
    <p>“This pushes us to our lim­its, be­cause we have to be on the ball 24/7... Even though we’re tired out­field, we have to con­stantly keep these mea­sures at the back of our minds.</p>
    <p>“This has trained us to be more re­silient lead­ers,” she said.</p>
