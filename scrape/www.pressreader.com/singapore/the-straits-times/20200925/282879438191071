    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong su­per­star Andy Lau (left), who turns 59 on Sun­day, thrilled tens of thou­sands of fans i n Sin­ga­pore when he held four con­certs i n Septem­ber last year, in­clud­ing one on his birth­day.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor-singer usu­ally cel­e­brates the oc­ca­sion with his fans, in­clud­ing those from his of­fi­cial fan club, Andy World Club.</p>
    <p>How­ever, due to the coronaviru­s pan­demic, he will be un­able to hold a phys­i­cal cel­e­bra­tion this year.</p>
    <p>Lau, who is known for songs such as Wa­ter Of For­got­ten Love and Thank You For Your Love, will in­stead be hold­ing his first on­line birth­day cel­e­bra­tion, which will be broad­cast on Andy World Club’s web­site at 8pm on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Hong Kong me­dia, Lau was ex­cited when dis­cussing plans with his staff and has put in great ef­fort in pre­par­ing for the event.</p>
    <p>Last year, his fan-club birth­day bash was can­celled in the light of ten­sions sur­round­ing anti-gov­ern­ment protests in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Lau also had to can­cel sev­eral of his sched­uled con­certs in Hong Kong and main­land China this year due to the pan­demic.</p>
