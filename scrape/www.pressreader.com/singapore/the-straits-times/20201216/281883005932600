    <p>What in many ways has been Sin­ga­pore’s worst year since in­de­pen­dence is set to con­clude with the wel­come news that the coun­try will pro­ceed to phase three of its re­open­ing on Dec 28. The coron­avirus pan­demic, which be­gan here with the first re­ported case in Jan­uary, turned per­sonal, eco­nomic and so­cial life up­side down swiftly and surely. In March and April, Covid-19 peaked at over 1,000 cases a day here. The twom­onth cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April and May re­versed that trend by im­pos­ing strin­gent reg­u­la­tions on the con­duct of ev­ery­day so­cial life in the larger, crit­i­cal in­ter­ests of safety. How­ever, it was clear even af­ter that pe­riod that Sin­ga­pore could not re­vert to the sta­tus quo ante. Hence the jour­ney to a new nor­mal be­gan, with the prospect of grad­ual and cal­i­brated phases of re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>The ar­rival of phase three sig­nals the suc­cess of the man­age­ment of both ear­lier phases. Credit must go not only to the ac­tive mea­sures taken by the au­thor­i­ties, who were al­ways on the alert and pre­pared to make nec­es­sary ad­just­ments, but also to Sin­ga­pore­ans who took the coro­n­avi­ral threat se­ri­ously and ad­justed their rou­tines and ex­pec­ta­tions ac­cord­ingly. Un­der the next phase, the per­mit­ted group size for so­cial gath­er­ings will go up from five to eight; ca­pac­ity lim­its in pub­lic places such as malls, at­trac­tions and places of wor­ship will also be in­creased. This means lo­cal at­trac­tions can ap­ply to in­crease op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity from 50 per cent to 65 per cent. Ca­pac­ity lim­its for malls and large stand­alone stores will change from 10 sq m per per­son to 8 sq m per per­son. Re­stric­tions on re­li­gious groups, wed­dings, fu­ner­als and live per­for­mances will be re­laxed as well.</p>
    <p>Equally im­por­tant is that more trav­ellers will be al­lowed to en­ter and tran­sit through here. The risks are un­de­ni­able. But en­hanced test­ing and trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties of­fer a way of manag­ing them. The truth is that the longer bor­ders are closed, the greater the pos­si­bil­ity that Sin­ga­pore could lose its sta­tus as an in­ter­na­tional hub – to the detri­ment of the econ­omy which de­pends on the coun­try’s po­si­tion as a global eco­nomic node. The im­pend­ing ar­rival of phase three – and a vac­cine that is at hand – is light at the end of the tunnel. But it is by no means the end of the fight.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 re­mains a global epi­demic. Coun­tries that suc­ceeded in con­tain­ing the out­break have seen a dan­ger­ous resur­gence. That re­quired new clam­p­downs, and ne­gated the gains made ear­lier. The num­ber of cases here may be on the de­cline and ap­pear sta­ble. But this can be sus­tained only if peo­ple con­tinue to be­have re­spon­si­bly and ex­er­cise care and con­sid­er­a­tion for oth­ers. A sense of re­lief is un­der­stand­able. But cau­tion must re­main the key­word be­cause all it takes is one case to start new in­fec­tions. Sin­ga­pore­ans have sac­ri­ficed much over the course of the year. Those ef­forts must not have been made in vain.</p>
