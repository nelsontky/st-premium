    <p>An an­gered drug of­fender re­peat­edly stabbed a man who had of­fered to per­form a sex­ual act on him, caus­ing nine wounds near his heart, liver, colon, small in­tes­tine and stom­ach.</p>
    <p>A dis­trict court had ear­lier heard that the in­juries to any of these body parts could be po­ten­tially life-threat­en­ing.</p>
    <p>A doc­tor said the 29-year-old Filipino vic­tim could suf­fer l ongterm com­pli­ca­tions such as chronic ab­dom­i­nal pain aris­ing from the sur­gi­cal wounds.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, his Sin­ga­porean at­tacker, In­dra Hafiq Az­man, was or­dered to un­dergo re­for­ma­tive train­ing for at least a year.</p>
    <p>This means the 20-year-old will be de­tained at a cen­tre and made to fol­low a strict reg­i­men that in­cludes foot drills and coun­selling.</p>
    <p>In­dra had ear­lier pleaded guilty to one count each of drug con­sump­tion, caus­ing griev­ous hurt with a weapon and caus­ing hurt.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Bryan Wong said that In­dra had re­ported for his urine test at Tan­glin Po­lice Di­vi­sional Head­quar­ters at around 8.45pm on Aug 20 last year. Af­ter that, he boarded bus ser­vice 166.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim boarded the same bus soon af­ter and sat be­side him.</p>
    <p>The Filipino felt at­tracted to In­dra and re­peat­edly glanced at him. He then typed out a mes­sage on his mo­bile phone, of­fer­ing to per­form a sex­ual act on In­dra who be­came an­noyed over the un­wanted at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “The ac­cused ig­nored the vic­tim and the lat­ter kept his mo­bile phone in his bag.</p>
    <p>By then, the ac­cused felt an­gered by the vic­tim’s ac­tions.”</p>
    <p>The bus stopped along Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 1 at around 9pm and In­dra stood up. While alight­ing, he made a ges­ture to the Filipino who fol­lowed him. In­dra sud­denly at­tacked the vic­tim, rain­ing punches on him as he tried to get away.</p>
    <p>DPP Wong told the court: “De­spite this, the ac­cused con­tin­ued to fol­low the vic­tim and hit him. The vic­tim even­tu­ally fell to the ground.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the at­tack, the vic­tim re­peat­edly apol­o­gised to the ac­cused, un­suc­cess­fully beg­ging him to stop. The ac­cused also ad­mit­ted to kick­ing the vic­tim mul­ti­ple times in the face when the lat­ter lay on the ground.”</p>
    <p>Passers-by who wit­nessed the at­tack shouted at In­dra and he walked away.</p>
    <p>He later spot­ted a sharp ob­ject “slightly longer than the length of his fist”, picked it up and walked back to the vic­tim.</p>
    <p>He then stabbed the Filipino re­peat­edly with the ob­ject be­fore toss­ing it to the ground.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal where he was found with in­juries in­clud­ing nine stab wounds.</p>
    <p>Shaf­fiq Alkhatib</p>
    <p>Num­ber of wounds In­dra Hafiq Az­man, 20, caused his 29-year-old Filipino vic­tim.</p>
