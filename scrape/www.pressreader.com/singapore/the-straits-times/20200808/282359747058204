    <p>• Hav­ing landed the top seed in the East­ern Con­fer­ence for the sec­ond straight year, the ques­tion is whether the Mil­wau­kee Bucks can trans­late their reg­u­lar-sea­son form to the play-offs.</p>
    <p>Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo be­lieves the big­gest chal­lenge in their bid to win just their sec­ond Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) cham­pi­onship ti­tle – and the first one since 1971 – is not one of their ri­vals like the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers, but rather them­selves.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent Most Valu­able Player (MVP) and fel­low All-Star Khris Mid­dle­ton had a game-high 33 points apiece as the Bucks ral­lied from a 23-point deficit to de­feat the Mi­ami Heat 130-116 at Dis­ney World on Thursday, seal­ing the con­fer­ence’s top seed in the process.</p>
    <p>With a league-lead­ing 55-14 record and four games left, they are also the favourites to be crowned the best reg­u­lar-sea­son team two years in a row.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo is look­ing for­ward to go­ing one bet­ter than last sea­son, when they fell to even­tual cham­pi­ons Toronto Rap­tors in the East­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>“It was a good chal­lenge for us,” said the for­ward. “It’s good to face ad­ver­sity. It’s good to be un­com­fort­able. It’s good to be down.</p>
    <p>“It’s good to chase be­cause that’s when you get bet­ter. You need chal­lenges so you can im­prove as a team.”</p>
    <p>On play­ing to their po­ten­tial, he added: “Prob­a­bly the big­gest chal­lenge for us is our­selves.</p>
    <p>“It’s, ‘How are we go­ing to play? How hard are we go­ing to play? Are we go­ing to play for one an­other? Are we go­ing to de­fend hard? Are we go­ing to make that ex­tra ef­fort?’ It’s all about us.”</p>
    <p>Dun­can Robin­son had 21 points to pace the Heat, who are fourth in the East at 43-26 and, if the stand­ings stay as they are, both teams could meet in the sec­ond round of the play-offs.</p>
    <p>De­spite play­ing without All-Stars Jimmy But­ler and Go­ran Dragic due to in­juries, Mi­ami gave the NBA’s top-rated de­fen­sive squad a fright, just like when they won their two pre­vi­ous meet­ings.</p>
    <p>The Heat threat­ened to com­plete the series sweep, but An­te­tok­oun­mpo felt they had ul­ti­mately shown their cham­pi­onship met­tle.</p>
    <p>“We talked to one an­other and came out in the sec­ond half and played bet­ter,” the “Greek Freak” said. “We’re not go­ing to let them think we’re soft. This is who we are.</p>
    <p>“From de­fence, our of­fence starts. That’s who we are as a team. We play our best when we de­fend.”</p>
    <p>In the other key games of the day, Fi­nals MVP Kawhi Leonard, who in­spired the Toronto Rap­tors to their first NBA cham­pi­onship last term, scored 29 points to lead the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers over the Dal­las Mav­er­icks 126-111, pulling them 11/</p>
    <p>2 games ahead of the Den­ver Nuggets for sec­ond spot in the West.</p>
    <p>“It’s about ex­e­cut­ing, mak­ing sure we’re putting in the ef­fort out there,” the for­ward said. “Just get­ting in game shape, get­ting our legs ready and our minds.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, cen­tre Dean­dre Ay­ton scored 23 points and grabbed 10 re­bounds, while guard Devin Booker added 20 points and 10 as­sists as the Phoenix Suns beat the In­di­ana Pac­ers 114-99 for their fourth straight win in the “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>They im­proved to 30-39, two rungs and two games be­hind eighth-placed Mem­phis Griz­zlies, who oc­cu­pied the fi­nal play-off spot in the West.</p>
