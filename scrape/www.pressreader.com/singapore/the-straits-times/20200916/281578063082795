    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said Malaysia will not be rush­ing to re­open its bor­ders, as it tries to keep out the chain of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions. He said that al­though Malaysia has done well in man­ag­ing the spread of Covid-19, the sud­den surge of cases re­cently has left him wor­ried.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin yes­ter­day urged Malaysians to re­main on guard against Covid-19 in­fec­tions, as the pan­demic has not shown signs of slow­ing down around the world, though the dis­ease re­mains un­der con­trol in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din said Malaysia will not be rush­ing to re­open its bor­ders as it tries to keep out the chain of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Don’t feel awk­ward wear­ing it (face mask). The us­age of face masks has be­come com­mon in so­ci­ety. We must all play the role of the ‘front-line of­fi­cers’ and con­tinue to adopt the new nor­mal in life,” he said in a tele­vised ad­dress ahead of Malaysia Day cel­e­bra­tions to­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has mostly shut its bor­ders to in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers since March.</p>
    <p>“Those al­lowed to fly into the coun­try must un­dergo a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“The coun­try’s bor­der con­trol will also be fur­ther en­hanced to curb the in­flux of po­ten­tially in­fected in­di­vid­u­als into our coun­try,” Mr Muhyid­din said.</p>
    <p>Al­though strict bor­der con­trols have im­posed dif­fi­cul­ties on those who do busi­ness abroad, Mr Muhyid­din said stern ac­tion must be taken to pro­tect the peo­ple and coun­try from the life-threat­en­ing epi­demic.</p>
    <p>“We need to bal­ance be­tween the need to pro­tect lives and the lives of Malaysians. We must strike a fine bal­ance be­tween pro­tect­ing the lives and liveli­hoods of all Malaysians... There­fore, the gov­ern­ment will not rush to open our bor­ders,” he said.</p>
    <p>He said that al­though Malaysia has done well in man­ag­ing the spread of Covid-19, the sud­den surge of cases re­cently has left him wor­ried.</p>
    <p>“Over the past 14 days, a to­tal of 615 cases have been recorded. This in­crease also saw three dis­tricts record­ing 41 cases or more over the last 14 days,” he said, re­fer­ring to Kota Se­tar dis­trict in Kedah state, and Tawau and La­had Datu in Sabah state.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­ported 182 cases last Fri­day, the high­est in three months since June 4, when 277 cases were recorded. The spike was caused by sev­eral clus­ters in the three dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>Malaysia first im­posed move­ment curbs on March 18. The coun­try will con­tinue with the im­po­si­tion of strict health pro­to­cols un­til Dec 31, fol­low­ing an ex­ten­sion an­nounced by Mr Muhyid­din on Aug 28.</p>
    <p>Un­der the on­go­ing re­cov­ery move­ment con­trol or­der that be­gan on June 10, most busi­nesses have been al­lowed to re­open, but they must fol­low pro­to­cols such as record­ing the tem­per­a­tures of vis­i­tors to their premises and im­pos­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Malaysia on Aug 1 made it com­pul­sory for ev­ery­one to wear face masks in crowded pub­lic places and on pub­lic trans­port, after the au­thor­i­ties ob­served lower com­pli­ance of so­cial dis­tanc­ing when it en­tered the re­cov­ery phase of the move­ment curbs.</p>
    <p>The coun­try yes­ter­day re­ported 23 new Covid-19 cases, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions to 9,969. The death toll from the virus re­mained at 128.</p>
