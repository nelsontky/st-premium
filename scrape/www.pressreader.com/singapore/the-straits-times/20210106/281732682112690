    <p>A Sin­ga­porean doc­tor, who trans­ferred US$11.55 mil­lion (S$15.2 mil­lion) to a bank ac­count in Ro­ma­nia over two months to fund his on­line trad­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, sued var­i­ous par­ties to get the money back af­ter the ac­count was frozen by lo­cal au­thor­i­ties for sus­pected money laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>In his suit filed in Sin­ga­pore’s High Court, Dr Christo­pher Chen Yun Hian ac­cused six de­fen­dants of con­spir­ing to de­fraud him by mis­lead­ing him into in­vest­ing huge sums of money on a bo­gus trad­ing plat­form. But in a writ­ten de­ci­sion last week, Ju­di­cial Com­mis­sioner Mavis Chionh found that Dr Chen’s story about a con­spir­acy was “cooked up in a des­per­ate at­tempt to re­coup his losses”.</p>
    <p>She was giv­ing de­tailed rea­sons for her de­ci­sion in July last year to grant ap­pli­ca­tions by three of the de­fen­dants to set aside the writ that had been served on them.</p>
    <p>They con­tended that the Sin­ga­pore court has no ju­ris­dic­tion to hear Dr Chen’s claims.</p>
    <p>The three are: BHNV On­line, the Belize-based com­pany that op­er­ated the Opteck trad­ing plat­form; its founder and owner Ben Yitzhak Zur, an Is­raeli cit­i­zen; and Is­raeli busi­ness­man Gi­lad Tisona, the owner of a com­pany that bought some of BHNV’s as­sets in 2015.</p>
    <p>The judge agreed that Belize, not Sin­ga­pore, was the proper fo­rum for Dr Chen to pur­sue his claims. She pointed to the fact that the con­tract he signed pro­vided for dis­putes to be ad­ju­di­cated in the Cen­tral Amer­i­can coun­try. She re­jected his con­tention that his claims in the Belizean courts may be time-barred.</p>
    <p>“He wil­fully chose not to lit­i­gate in the con­trac­tu­ally agreed fo­rum... and in­stead gam­bled on the chance that the Sin­ga­pore courts would over­look his fo­rum-shop­ping and al­low him to lit­i­gate here.</p>
    <p>“That gam­ble has not paid off, and the plain­tiff has only him­self to blame if he ul­ti­mately winds up un­able to pur­sue his claims,” said the judge. Fo­rum-shop­ping refers to lit­i­gants try­ing to have their case heard in the court that they be­lieve would be most favourable to them.</p>
    <p>Dr Chen, an ob­ste­tri­cian and gy­nae­col­o­gist, has ap­pealed against the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>He al­leged that in Au­gust 2013, he clicked on an on­line ad­ver­tise­ment and was di­rected to the Opteck web­site, which had in­for­ma­tion on bi­nary op­tions trad­ing.</p>
    <p>He lost US$37,000 in Septem­ber 2013. Be­tween Oct 10 and Dec 5, 2013, he trans­ferred five sums to­talling US$11.55 mil­lion to BHNV’s bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>The bank, af­ter check­ing the source for the last two trans­fers to­talling US$5.5 mil­lion, re­ported the trans­ac­tions to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the money was frozen, Dr Chen filed mul­ti­ple re­ports al­leg­ing that he was a vic­tim of fraud.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary 2017, Dr Chen sued BHNV, Mr Zur, a BHNV em­ployee named Dean Tay­lor who acted as his “in­vest­ment men­tor”, and two other em­ploy­ees. The em­ploy­ees have yet to be served with the writ.</p>
    <p>In April 2018, he added Mr Tisona as a de­fen­dant, which the judge found was a bid by Dr Chen to “cast his net as widely as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>The judge found that the ev­i­dence did not bear out Dr Chen’s al­le­ga­tions of fraud. She also noted that in­te­gral to the al­leged con­spir­acy was Mr Tay­lor gain­ing his trust. Yet, Dr Chen lost more than US$12 mil­lion be­tween Septem­ber and De­cem­ber 2013.</p>
    <p>“Any crook in­tent on de­fraud­ing him would surely have at­tempted to con­ceal these hefty losses from him,” she said.</p>
