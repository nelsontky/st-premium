    <p>•</p>
    <p>You can­not eat there or col­lect your meal.</p>
    <p>But so-called ghost kitchens, which pre­pare food only for de­liv­ery, are boom­ing in the United States amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Do not look for a Fire­belly Wings or a Mon­ster Mac restau­rant any­where in Amer­ica be­cause you will not find their signs on any street.</p>
    <p>In­stead, their chicken wings or mac­a­roni and cheese are found via smart­phones. The new brands, like dozens of oth­ers, were in­vented solely for de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Their dishes are pre­pared i n “ghost” kitchens, hid­den com­mer­cial spa­ces closed to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The trend, some­times called “dark” kitchens, has been around for a cou­ple of years but is en­joy­ing a huge boost due to coro­n­avirus shut­downs.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumer be­hav­iour has been al­tered by Covid-19,” said a spokesman for Nextbite, an op­er­a­tor of ghost kitchens.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumers who had never or­dered from de­liv­ery plat­forms have adopted the con­ve­nience.”</p>
    <p>Restau­rants closed for months, oth­ers open with re­duced ca­pac­ity, cus­tomers pre­fer­ring to eat at home for fear of in­fec­tion – ev­ery­thing has been point­ing to­wards in­creased de­mand for de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>DoorDash, the lead­ing food de­liv­ery plat­form in the US with 47 per cent mar­ket share, han­dled 543 mil­lion or­ders between Jan­uary and Septem­ber, a three­fold in­crease over last year.</p>
    <p>“It’s cap­i­tal­is­ing a l ot on the restau­rants that have closed. But at the same time, there’s new de­mand cre­ated too,” said Mr R.J. Hot­tovy, di­rec­tor of fi­nan­cial an­a­lyt­ics at global restau­rant con­sul­tancy firm Aaron Allen & As­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>Zuul, C3, Kitchen United and CloudKitch­ens, which is headed by Uber co-founder Travis Kalan­ick, of­fer restau­ra­teurs kitchens – some­times fully equipped – along with tech­ni­cal sup­port to man­age or­ders and ad­vice on de­vel­op­ing their brands.</p>
    <p>Nextbite fo­cuses on the lat­ter, help­ing restau­rants de­velop new menus in their ex­ist­ing kitchens.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional cater­ers are get­ting in on the act, open­ing ghost kitchens un­der their own names and in­vent­ing new culi­nary of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is try­ing to ad­dress the down­ward pres­sure on your mar­gins,” said Zuul chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Kristen Bar­nett, who man­ages a fa­cil­ity in New York that houses nine dif­fer­ent ghost kitchens.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Roper, chief ex­ec­u­tive of healthy fast-food chain Mus­cle Maker Grill, says a dark kitchen can be opened with a US$75,000 (S$100,000) in­vest­ment. A clas­sic bricks-and-mor­tar restau­rant would cost “between US$350,000 and US$500,000”, he said.</p>
    <p>With a rental kitchen, “I can switch to a salad con­cept, to a burger con­cept. I can make those changes pretty rapidly and all the cost to me at that stage is some art­work and maybe se­cur­ing the name”, he said.</p>
    <p>Zuul also of­fers its own or­der­ing plat­form to help restau­rants fur­ther im­prove mar­gins.</p>
    <p>It is in­tended to re­place de­liv­er­ers like DoorDash or Uber Eats that can take up to 30 per cent of the cost of the or­der.</p>
    <p>Ghost kitchens op­er­ate with­out the wait­ers and man­agers needed to run tra­di­tional restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Mr Hot­tovy notes that the restau­rant sec­tor has been mov­ing to­wards a “much more pro­duc­tive model” in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>“It prob­a­bly means down the road,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Restau­rant Op­por­tu­ni­ties Cen­tres United re­cently warned of in­creased job in­se­cu­rity at ghost less jobs kitchens com­pared with more tra­di­tional out­lets.</p>
    <p>For some in the restau­rant in­dus­try, the model made it pos­si­ble for them to sur­vive the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Roper does not think cus­tomers will stop or­der­ing in or slow down when the virus is un­der con­trol and restau­rants are free to serve as they did be­fore.</p>
    <p>“Once they learn how easy it is, the food comes on time, it’s hot, it’s good, just the con­ve­nience, they’re go­ing to keep do­ing it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The whole in­dus­try has kind of changed.”</p>
