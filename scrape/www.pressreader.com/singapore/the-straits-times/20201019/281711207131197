    <p>There were two new lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases of Covid-19 in­fec­tion re­ported in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing one un­linked com­mu­nity case and one in a work­ers’ dor­mi­tory, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>There were also five im­ported cases, who had all been placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in the coun­try. These seven new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions to 57,911.</p>
    <p>The sole com­mu­nity case re­ported yes­ter­day was a 40-year-old male Bangladesh­i na­tional who works as a tech­ni­cian.</p>
    <p>The man had not gone to work af­ter he first de­vel­oped symp­toms last Wed­nes­day. He was later de­tected through com­mu­nity test­ing of all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion. The pa­tient also took a sero­log­i­cal test that came back pos­i­tive, which in­di­cates a likely past in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Among the new cases re­ported yes­ter­day, only two were symp­to­matic. The five asymp­to­matic cases were de­tected from proac­tive screen­ing and sur­veil­lance.</p>
    <p>Of the im­ported cases, four are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore. Two were fe­male work per­mit hold­ers aged 40 and 27 re­spec­tively, who had ar­rived from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The other two were a 32-year-old male work pass holder who had ar­rived from Greece and a 48-year-old male work pass holder from France.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing case is a 17-yearold male stu­dent pass holder from Gu­atemala.</p>
    <p>The sin­gle Covid-19 case re­ported in the dor­mi­to­ries yes­ter­day was de­tected through fort­nightly rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing there.</p>
    <p>Nine more cases of Covid-19 in­fec­tion have been dis­charged from hos­pi­tals or com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties. This brings the num­ber of peo­ple who have fully re­cov­ered from the in­fec­tion to 57,792.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that 40 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 36 are in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the Covid-19 out­break – which be­gan last De­cem­ber – has in­fected more than 39.6 mil­lion peo­ple and killed over 1.11 mil­lion.</p>
