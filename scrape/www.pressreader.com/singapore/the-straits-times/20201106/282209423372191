    <p>Stock markets in the re­gion ral­lied strongly yes­ter­day de­spite the out­come of the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion hang­ing in the bal­ance.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts and in­vestors had ini­tially hoped for a de­ci­sive out­come, but many seem to now ac­cept that some po­lit­i­cal grid­lock might be a good thing.</p>
    <p>“On the bright side, Trump’s tax cuts are un­likely to be re­versed un­der this sce­nario,” said the Bank of</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore in a note, adding that po­lit­i­cal grid­lock will also make it harder for stim­u­lus spend­ing pro­grammes to be en­acted. Still, it is ex­pect­ing “suf­fi­cient com­mon ground” for US law­mak­ers to pass a re­lief aid pack­age of about US$500 bil­lion (S$677.96 bil­lion) in the first quar­ter next year.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal shares made the most of the buoy­ant mood yes­ter­day, with the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) clos­ing up 72.64 points, or 2.89 per cent, to 2,588.62. Gain­ers out­num­bered losers 325 to 143 on trade of 1.8 bil­lion shares worth $1.87 bil­lion. All but four of the STI com­po­nents ended the day higher.</p>
    <p>The best per­former was As­cen­das Reit, which ended 6.65 per cent higher at $3.21. It was fol­lowed closely by Cap­i­taLand In­te­grated Com­mer­cial Trust, which climbed 6.18 per cent to $1.89.</p>
    <p>The most heav­ily traded stocks by value were the three banks – DBS, OCBC and UOB – which also re­ported their third-quar­ter num­bers and pro­vided rel­a­tively pos­i­tive guid­ance this week.</p>
    <p>DBS ended the day 4.08 per cent higher at $22.43. OCBC climbed 3.48 per cent to $8.93 and UOB was up 3.23 per cent to $20.44.</p>
    <p>Around the re­gion, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex rose 3.25 per cent and South Korea’s Kospi put on 2.4 per cent. Closer to home, key bench­marks for Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok were up about 3 per cent.</p>
