    <p>• Lamine Di­ack, the for­mer head of world ath­let­ics’ gov­ern­ing body, was con­victed in Paris yes­ter­day of cor­rup­tion in a Rus­sian dop­ing scan­dal and sen­tenced to spend at least two years in jail.</p>
    <p>The 87-year-old was found guilty of tak­ing bribes from ath­letes in re­turn for or­ches­trat­ing the cover-up of test results that en­abled them to con­tinue com­pet­ing, in­clud­ing in the 2012 London Olympics.</p>
    <p>He was also found guilty of ac­cept­ing Rus­sian money to help fi­nance Macky Sall’s 2012 pres­i­den­tial cam­paign in Sene­gal, his home coun­try, in ex­change for slow­ing anti-dop­ing pro­ce­dures, the court ruled.</p>
    <p>The court had heard how Di­ack so­licited bribes to­talling €3.45 mil­lion (S$5.5 mil­lion) from ath­letes sus­pected of drugs cheat­ing and paid off other of­fi­cials at the In­ter­na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Ath­let­ics Fed­er­a­tions (IAAF) to aid with the cover-up.</p>
    <p>The pre­sid­ing judge, Rose-Marie Hu­nault, said the for­mer l ong jumper’s ac­tions had “un­der­mined the val­ues of ath­let­ics and the fight against dop­ing”.</p>
    <p>“The money was paid in ex­change for a pro­gramme of ‘full pro­tec­tion’,” she said, adding that the scheme en­abled ath­letes who should have been sus­pended “to es­cape sanc­tions”. “You vi­o­lated the rules of the game.”</p>
    <p>The court handed Di­ack, who was wear­ing a white robe, a fouryear pri­son sen­tence, two years of which are sus­pended, and im­posed the max­i­mum fine of €500,000.</p>
    <p>Hu­nault, how­ever, said Di­ack was un­likely to go to jail, adding: “Given your age, you can ex­pect con­di­tional re­lease.”</p>
    <p>His lawyers called the judg­ment against him un­fair and in­hu­mane, and said they would ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Di­ack was once one of the most in­flu­en­tial men in the sport, lead­ing the IAAF, now known as World Ath­let­ics, from 1999 to 2015.</p>
    <p>In his tes­ti­mony, he ac­knowl</p>
    <p>JUST DESERTS</p>
    <p>edged slow­ing the han­dling of Rus­sian dop­ing cases be­tween 2011-2013 to save a spon­sor­ship deal with a Rus­sian bank and avoid a pub­lic scan­dal, but de­nied the cor­rup­tion al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>At the heart of the cor­rup­tion scam along­side Di­ack was his son, Papa Mas­sata Di­ack, a for­mer mar­ket­ing con­sul­tant for the IAAF.</p>
    <p>Hu­nault said the Di­acks worked to­gether in di­vert­ing funds, telling Di­ack Sr that there was “an un­der­stand­ing be­tween you and your son”, re­ported the As­so­ci­ated Press.</p>
    <p>The court sen­tenced Papa Mas­sata, who fled from France to Sene­gal after the French in­ves­ti­ga­tion be­gan, to five years in pri­son and im­posed a €1 mil­lion fine on him.</p>
    <p>It also or­dered both men to pay World Ath­let­ics €5 mil­lion in dam­ages for breach of trust.</p>
    <p>Four other de­fen­dants were charged in the case, in­clud­ing Habib Cisse, Di­ack’s for­mer lawyer at the IAAF; Gabriel Dolle, who over­saw dop­ing tests at the IAAF; for­mer head of Rus­sian ath­let­ics Valentin Balakhnitc­hev, and for­mer Rus­sian ath­let­ics’ head coach Alexei Mel­nikov.</p>
    <p>All four were also found guilty of cor­rup­tion of­fences.</p>
    <p>Be­hind my mask, you can’t see it, but I’m smil­ing. I’m pleased, too, for all the ath­letes. We have to keep up the fight against dop­ing.</p>
    <p>CHRIS­TELLE DAUNAY, French marathoner who was in court, on the ver­dict.</p>
