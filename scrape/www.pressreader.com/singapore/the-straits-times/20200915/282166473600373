    <p>SYD­NEY • For­get the flute of chilled Moet & Chan­don be­fore take-off, mid-flight gin and ton­ics, and a roam­ing dessert trol­ley after din­ner. Fly­ing busi­ness class isn’t what it used to be.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to min­imise hu­man in­ter­ac­tion and re­duce the risk of Covid-19 in­fec­tion are tak­ing the shine off the ex­pen­sive seats on­board com­mer­cial air­craft. Gone are the multi-course ban­quets and warm per­sonal ser­vice, once the hall­marks of car­ri­ers like Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) and Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways. These days, what’s left of pre­mium travel is func­tional, hy­gienic and closer to econ­omy class – only with more legroom.</p>
    <p>The lim­i­ta­tions are one more headache for an in­dus­try grap­pling with a near-to­tal col­lapse in de­mand – fol­low­ing years of lux­ury one­up­man­ship among car­ri­ers in a con­test for the most prof­itable pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>It is sud­denly harder to tell air­lines apart when you are up the pointy end. That is mak­ing it tougher to win top-pay­ing cus­tomers, and risks push­ing some to the back of the plane.</p>
    <p>‘FEELS LIKE ECON­OMY’</p>
    <p>“There’s no­body to help you with your bag, you’re not es­corted to your seat, and there’s def­i­nitely no pre-flight cham­pagne,” said food and bev­er­age con­sul­tant San­dra Lim, who flew busi­ness class to Sin­ga­pore from Los An­ge­les with SIA late last month.</p>
    <p>“It feels like it’s re­verted back to econ­omy class.”</p>
    <p>The crew wore face masks and eye shields, and avoided con­tact and shared touch points where pos­si­ble. While pas­sen­gers could ask for drinks, they were not freely of­fered, and there were no menus. Meals came with ev­ery­thing on one tray, just like in econ­omy, rather than in sep­a­rate cour­ses.</p>
    <p>“When you strip away the food and ser­vice, it’s just a mode of trans­port to get from point A to B,” said the 38-year-old con­sul­tant.</p>
    <p>Some over­seas routes have re­sumed, but traf­fic world­wide has barely started to creep back. In­ter­na­tional pas­sen­ger de­mand was down 92 per cent in July, and the planes that were fly­ing were typ­i­cally about half full, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata).</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia, for ex­am­ple, will re­open its bor­ders for travel only after Jan 1, the Saudi Press Agency re­ported on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It is also not clear to what ex­tent the pre­mium mar­ket, which Iata says gen­er­ated 30 per cent of air­lines’ in­ter­na­tional rev­enues last year, can re­cover. Many grounded busi­ness trav­ellers have be­come ac­cus­tomed to video con­fer­enc­ing rather than mak­ing vis­its in per­son, and a global re­ces­sion threat­ens cor­po­rate bud­gets.</p>
    <p>IAG, owner of Bri­tish Air­ways and Ibe­ria, said in July that leisure de­mand will re­cover be­fore cor­po­rate travel, and this “struc­tural change” in the mar­ket will lead to new cabin lay­outs.</p>
    <p>On a con­fer­ence call, IAG chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Stephen Gunning said Bri­tish Air­ways re­tired its Boe­ing 747s early partly be­cause they had so many pre­mium seats.</p>
    <p>Virgin Aus­tralia Hold­ings chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Paul Scur­rah said at a con­fer­ence this month that busi­ness travel would re­bound slower than the over­all mar­ket as some com­pa­nies main­tain work-fromhome poli­cies. Qan­tas Air­ways CEO Alan Joyce was op­ti­mistic that de­mand would fully re­cover, but not un­til 2023 or 2024.</p>
    <p>Low-cost air­lines such as Ryanair and Easy­Jet, largely ca­ter­ing to short-haul leisure trav­ellers, are likely to bounce back faster than air­lines with a big­ger in­ter­na­tional focus, UBS Group an­a­lysts said in an Aug 21 re­port.</p>
    <p>WILL THEY PAY FOR PRE­MIUM?</p>
    <p>The ap­peal of a larger, more com­fort­able seat that extends fully flat may be enough to keep busi­ness class pas­sen­gers com­ing back, said air trans­port man­age­ment lec­turer Volodymyr Bilotkach at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy. But it might be dif­fer­ent for those in pre­mium econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“On the air­lines where I have ex­pe­ri­enced it, this prod­uct was more ‘econ­omy’ than ‘pre­mium’ to be­gin with,” said Mr Bilotkach. “I don’t know if pas­sen­gers would be will­ing to pay that price dif­fer­en­tial now.”</p>
    <p>Yet air­lines some­how need to keep fill­ing pre­mium seats, or get rid of them. Ac­cord­ing to Mr Bilotkach, a sin­gle busi­ness class seat needs to gen­er­ate at least four times the profit of an econ­omy seat to jus­tify all the space it takes up in the plane.</p>
    <p>Some air­lines will use the pan­demic to per­ma­nently down­grade their of­fer­ings in pre­mium cab­ins to save money, said Mr Jeremy Clark, who runs Malaysia-based JC Con­sult­ing, which ad­vises car­ri­ers on ca­ter­ing and ser­vice. That means many air­line-de­pen­dent sup­pli­ers will shut, lim­it­ing the scope for on­board din­ing and ser­vice to bounce back to pre-pan­demic lev­els when travel re­cov­ers, he said.</p>
    <p>That said, “there will still be air­lines that recog­nise the value good food and ser­vice bring to their brand in re­turn for the rel­a­tively small cost of pro­vid­ing it”, said Mr Clark. “We’re hu­man be­ings. We like to be spoiled.”</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 has re­duced the fre­quency of ser­vice on­board, when con­di­tions are safe, air­lines will re­turn to a fuller culi­nary ser­vice with pre­mium cab­ins lead­ing the way, ac­cord­ing to Mr David Loft, chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer of Emi­rates unit dnata ca­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>SAFETY AS­PECT</p>
    <p>Un­til then, busi­ness- and first-class pas­sen­gers should ex­pect scaled­back ser­vice and more mod­est meals, said Miche­lin-starred chef Vi­neet Bha­tia, who has worked with Bri­tish Air­ways and Qatar Air­ways for al­most two decades.</p>
    <p>He said trav­ellers need not worry about the risk of in­fec­tion from the food or even a tip­ple – “hav­ing a scotch in a plane with 40 per cent al­co­hol is safer than hav­ing a glass of tap water,” he said – but they want to see some Covid-19 pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>“The safety as­pect has to be very vis­ual,“said Mr Bha­tia. “The pas­sen­ger wants to see crew main­tain­ing dis­tance, greet­ing him fully cov­ered, giv­ing him his meal in a wrapped-up box and leave. That looks like sci­ence fic­tion, but that’s how it is.”</p>
    <p>Even that was not quite enough for Ms Gra­ziela Gu­lud­jian, who took a 12 hour flight to Barcelona from Sin­ga­pore in busi­ness class last month. The SIA crew gave her a bag with a face mask, hand sani­tiser and dis­in­fec­tant wipes.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t feel com­fort­able,” said Ms Gu­lud­jian, who was mov­ing back to Spain with her hus­band and three chil­dren. “I didn’t want to fly, but I had no op­tion. I don’t want to travel any time soon.”</p>
