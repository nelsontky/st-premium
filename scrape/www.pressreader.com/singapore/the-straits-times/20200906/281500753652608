    <p>In my line of work, I am usu­ally the one putting peo­ple on the spot with some­times deeply per­sonal ques­tions.</p>
    <p>But the ta­bles were turned on me ear­lier this week as I sat in a 45-minute Zoom con­sul­ta­tion with Date High Fly­ers (DHF) founder and full-time love guru Anisa Has­san. The call was a fol­low-up to a dat­ing pro­file I filled up on her web­site.</p>
    <p>For the more pre­mium “black la­bel” tier of her match­mak­ing ser­vice, Ms Anisa susses out the clients her­self, usu­ally in per­son, so she can “per­son­ally vouch for them”, like a pro­fes­sional “wing­woman”, as she trawls her data­base for the right match.</p>
    <p>I am all of 31 and in my dat­ing prime, but – my grand­par­ents will be hor­ri­fied to read this – I am not ac­tively look­ing for a life part­ner. I am of the mind­set that if it hap­pens, it hap­pens and I don’t want to force it.</p>
    <p>Though I have met a few gems on dat­ing apps – who un­for­tu­nately did not stay in Sin­ga­pore long enough for any­thing long term to de­velop – the apps have not worked out great for me.</p>
    <p>I have also been “cat­fished” – the guy shows up and looks noth­ing like his pro­file pic­ture – so I thought I would put my faith in a match­maker to hope­fully change my for­tunes.</p>
    <p>Un­like a dat­ing pro­file on apps like Bum­ble or Tin­der, the one re­quested by DHF is far more com­pre­hen­sive. I had to fill in fields such as re­la­tion­ship goals (friend­ship, com­pan­ion­ship or mar­riage?), height, weight, body type, diet and drink­ing habits.</p>
    <p>There was also a bit where I had to se­lect key­words to de­scribe my­self (loyal, fam­ily-ori­ented, straight­for­ward, etc) and an en­tire page ded­i­cated to what I want in my ideal date (age range, eth­nic­ity, ed­u­ca­tion level, ideal per­son­al­ity traits).</p>
    <p>I must ad­mit I was un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally ner­vous dur­ing my call with Ms Anisa.</p>
    <p>Am I say­ing the right things? Is it too early to dis­cuss non-ne­go­tiables and re­la­tion­ship deal break­ers? Is my Star Wars Im­pe­rial star de­stroyer Zoom back­ground suf­fi­ciently con­vey­ing how much of a nerd I am? Can I change my mind?</p>
    <p>Fresh off cov­er­ing the Gen­eral Elec­tion, I imag­ine this must be what thor­ough back­ground checks for po­lit­i­cal can­di­dates is like. I was also asked about my fam­ily and re­la­tion­ship back­ground.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions like “Is there any­thing about you that you’d like to share that’s not im­me­di­ately ob­vi­ous?” and “What was the rea­son your last re­la­tion­ship didn’t work out?” made me feel like I was in a ther­apy ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The an­swers re­quired some level of soul search­ing that I was not quite pre­pared to do on a Mon­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ms Anisa was never in­va­sive.</p>
    <p>I get that she was merely find­ing ways to un­der­stand my needs and pa­ram­e­ters bet­ter, so she could find me the best match.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, I gave her only two days to find me a date, so I could meet this ar­ti­cle’s dead­line.</p>
    <p>A day af­ter our con­sult, she had three choices for me, in­clud­ing two In­dian men – one lo­cal, “dap­per” and close to my age. But he had got into a re­la­tion­ship re­cently. The other, a 45-year-old per­ma­nent res­i­dent, is a bit too far out of my com­fort­able age range.</p>
    <p>She sent over the pro­file of the third, a 30-some­thing cul­tured-sound­ing Cau­casian.</p>
    <p>Her as­so­ciate set a date up for me on Wed­nes­day at an Ital­ian restau­rant af­ter I said “yes” to his bio­data – just like what they do in Net­flix’s In­dian Match­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Our phone num­bers were sent to each other the day be­fore to min­imise in­ter­ac­tion and so as not to “spoil the mys­tery of dis­cov­er­ing who this per­son is”, as Ms Anisa put it.</p>
    <p>How did the date go?Well, on pa­per, we seem like a good fit, but if I meet some­one and his en­ergy does not sit right with me, it is prob­a­bly not go­ing to go be­yond the first date.</p>
    <p>That’s what hap­pened – the con­ver­sa­tion flowed, but we were just not on the same wave­length. And oh, it did not help that he was late by 15 min­utes.</p>
    <p>DHF’s job was not done though. I had to give a post-date de­brief the next day, where I was asked how long the date went and what I liked and didn’t.</p>
    <p>As Ms Anisa told me be­fore the date, it does not al­ways work out on the first try. So I went into it eyes wide open – al­beit with a sliver of hope that the match might work out.</p>
    <p>I’m just glad she did not tell me to “com­pro­mise”, “be flex­i­ble” or “ad­just”, as elite In­dian match­maker Sima Ta­paria ad­vises her fe­male clients in the Net­flix show.</p>
    <p>But there is one thing I agree with the al­ways-quotable Ta­paria: “Ul­ti­mately, my ef­forts are mean­ing­less if the stars are not aligned.”</p>
