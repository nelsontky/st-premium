    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim has waited for decades to take power in Malaysia. If he fi­nally achieves that goal, the 73-year-old op­po­si­tion leader will need to fig­ure out how to im­ple­ment poli­cies he has long ad­vo­cated in an in­creas­ingly frac­tious Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>While Malaysia has al­ways been be­set by coali­tion pol­i­tics, the for­mer rul­ing bloc helmed by Umno over­saw for six decades a sta­ble if dom­i­neer­ing gov­ern­ment with poli­cies aimed at ben­e­fit­ing the Malays, the coun­try’s main racial group.</p>
    <p>Its down­fall in 2018, spear­headed by Mr An­war and for­mer premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, promised an in­clu­sive mul­tira­cial “New Malaysia” free from cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet the new coali­tion quickly be­came be­set by pol­icy dif­fer­ences, while deal­ing with con­stant in­trigue over when Tun Dr Ma­hathir, 95, would hand over power to Mr An­war. The drama came to a head with Dr Ma­hathir’s res­ig­na­tion in Fe­bru­ary, prompt­ing a round of horse-trad­ing that pro­pelled Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin to the pre­mier­ship.</p>
    <p>This week, Mr An­war claimed to have a “con­vinc­ing” ma­jor­ity to un­seat Mr Muhyid­din, and vowed to prove the num­bers in a meet­ing with Malaysia’s monarch that has yet to be sched­uled.</p>
    <p>It is still un­clear whether that will lead to an­other change in lead­er­ship or a fresh elec­tion. But one thing is cer­tain: The po­lit­i­cal land­scape is far from set­tled.</p>
    <p>“It’s the most fluid pe­riod in Malaysian pol­i­tics ever – the party al­le­giances have be­come very, very shaky,” said Dr Jo­han Sar­a­vana­muttu, an ad­junct se­nior fel­low at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies. “It’s just to be in power. Whether the whole idea of re­form pol­i­tics is the di­rec­tion be­ing taken is not en­tirely clear to me. Ide­al­ism is out of the win­dow.”</p>
    <p>ROYAL PAR­DON</p>
    <p>For Mr An­war, a lit­tle prag­ma­tism might be for­given. He was seen as Dr Ma­hathir’s suc­ces­sor in the 1990s be­fore he was fired in the wake of the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, af­ter which he spent six years in jail for abuse of power and sodomy.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war went back to jail again in 2015 on an­other sodomy charge, only to be re­leased af­ter the 2018 elec­tion thanks to a royal par­don.</p>
    <p>As leader of a key party in the pre­vi­ous Pakatan Hara­pan gov­ern­ment, Mr An­war waited pa­tiently for Dr Ma­hathir to ful­fil a pledge to even­tu­ally name him prime min­is­ter. But Dr Ma­hathir kept push­ing back the date, and soon the gov­ern­ment un­rav­elled.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Mr An­war said he was ready to re­place Mr Muhyid­din, who took of­fice in March. While Mr Muhyid­din de­nounced the push for power, Umno leader Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi said some mem­bers of the gov­ern­ment’s big­gest party were now back­ing Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>On the sur­face, it would seem odd for Mr An­war to link up with mem­bers of Umno given he pre­vi­ously called for the end of af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion poli­cies it cham­pi­oned.</p>
    <p>He has also blasted the party for cor­rup­tion re­lated to for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak, who was in July sen­tenced to 12 years in pri­son over the 1MDB scan­dal.</p>
    <p>FAIR REP­RE­SEN­TA­TION</p>
    <p>But Mr An­war has shown signs of soft­en­ing his stance in re­cent years, and made clear in his state­ment on Wed­nes­day that the ma­jor­ity of law­mak­ers back­ing him were “Malay and Mus­lim”. He promised “fair rep­re­sen­ta­tion” for all races.</p>
    <p>“We are com­mit­ted to up­hold the prin­ci­ples of the Con­sti­tu­tion that recog­nises the po­si­tion of Is­lam, the sovereignt­y of the Malay rulers, and up­hold the po­si­tion of the Malay lan­guage as the of­fi­cial lan­guage and the spe­cial po­si­tion of the Malays and Bu­mi­put­era as well as give as­sur­ance to de­fend the rights of all races,” he said.</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>If Mr An­war fi­nally takes power, he will in­herit an econ­omy that had suf­fered its worst per­for­mance in the sec­ond quar­ter since the fi­nan­cial cri­sis in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din has pushed ma­jor fis­cal stim­u­lus to re­vive the econ­omy hard hit by Covid-19. Higher debt lev­els may make it hard for Mr An­war to do any­thing too am­bi­tious.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s state­ment on Wed­nes­day em­pha­sised the need for a sta­ble gov­ern­ment to see Malaysia through the pan­demic. It was largely fo­cused on bread-and-but­ter is­sues, rather than lofty calls for re­form.</p>
