    <p>As a child, me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer Ja­son Blaise D’Souza used to take part in drama per­for­mances and recitals in school. All was well un­til he started stam­mer­ing when he was eight years old.</p>
    <p>A sim­ple ques­tion such as “What is your name?” would trig­ger fear in him be­cause he could not even pro­nounce his name prop­erly.</p>
    <p>His stam­mer­ing in­ten­si­fied when he had to speak to a group or talk about a dif­fi­cult sub­ject.</p>
    <p>“My face would con­tort. I’d blink rapidly or tap my leg in­ces­santly while try­ing to get the words out,” said the 38-year-old, an In­dian na­tional who has lived in Sin­ga­pore since 2013.</p>
    <p>He is not sure what caused him to stam­mer, but his mother told him it started af­ter she put him in a room at night and switched off the lights as pun­ish­ment for be­ing naughty.</p>
    <p>It was so bad that Mr D’Souza could not say a word with­out stam­mer­ing at times.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting even five words out in a sen­tence with­out stam­mer­ing was a huge achieve­ment for me,” said the fa­ther of two, who wants to high­light the speech dis­or­der on Internatio­nal Stam­mer­ing Aware­ness Day, marked yearly on Oct 22.</p>
    <p>It has been re­ported that 1 per cent of adults world­wide have a stam­mer­ing prob­lem, but there are no of­fi­cial fig­ures on the num­ber of peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore who are af­flicted with it.</p>
    <p>Ms Zheng Jun­wei, a speech ther­a­pist at Start Speech Ther­apy, a pri­vate clinic, said the num­ber of stam­mer­ers here is “very small” and this could be why there are no sup­port groups or events to mark the day.</p>
    <p>She sees about 10 to 15 stam­mer­ing cases a year, with more males than fe­males. They range in age from three to those in their 50s.</p>
    <p>It is not clear what causes stam­mer­ing or stut­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Zheng said it is most likely caused by a prob­lem with the neu­ral pro­cess­ing of the brain areas in­volved in speech pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The usual treat­ment for chil­dren is the Lid­combe Pro­gramme, a be­havioural treat­ment based on giv­ing con­sis­tent feed­back to the child about his speech in a sup­port­ive and non-judg­men­tal way, she said.</p>
    <p>Adults, she said, are usu­ally treated with speech re­struc­tur­ing – the re­place­ment of stut­tered speech with a dif­fer­ent speech pat­tern that en­ables them to con­trol their symp­toms while sound­ing as nat­u­ral as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>In Mr D’Souza’s case, his stam­mer­ing made him shy and he had only a hand­ful of friends.</p>
    <p>He would avoid phone calls and forgo or­der­ing his favourite food at a restau­rant for some­thing that was sim­pler to pro­nounce. He would also rather get lost than ask peo­ple for help.</p>
    <p>To over­come the prob­lem, he saw speech ther­a­pists, at­tended work­shops and tried spir­i­tual and en­ergy heal­ing as well as med­i­ta­tion, but noth­ing worked.</p>
    <p>In 2018, he had a break­through when he tried the McGuire pro­gramme, which com­bines tech­niques such as di­aphrag­matic breath­ing and de­lib­er­ate dis­flu­ency – pur­pose­fully stam­mer­ing – with men­tal strate­gies for deal­ing with the fear of stam­mer­ing.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which is founded and taught by peo­ple who stam­mer, runs cour­ses across the world.</p>
    <p>Mr D’Souza at­tended a four-day course in Ben­galuru, In­dia, in 2018 and saw a big im­prove­ment in his speech and con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>He still stut­ters, but can now say his name con­fi­dently. He also tries to find op­por­tu­ni­ties to speak to peo­ple and has be­come a coach for the same course he had at­tended to in­spire oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“I am able to con­trol my fear of speak­ing and not let it crip­ple me. I feel a sense of con­fi­dence, pride, hap­pi­ness, free­dom and as­sertive­ness when I speak now,” he said.</p>
