    <p>• South Korea yes­ter­day can­celled the li­cences of two an­tiNorth Korea groups that send pro­pa­ganda leaflets into the North, in­fu­ri­at­ing its gov­ern­ment and un­der­min­ing South Korean ef­forts to en­gage with its iso­lated neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>Groups run by North Korean de­fec­tors have for years sent anti-North Korea leaflets, along with food, medicine, $1 bills, mini ra­dios and USB sticks with South Korean dra­mas and news into the North, usu­ally by bal­loon or in bot­tles on bor­der rivers. The leaflets also of­ten in­clude crit­i­cism of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over hu­man rights abuses and his nu­clear am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment of South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in is keen to im­prove ties with the North and so asked the groups to stop send­ing the pro­pa­ganda, but they re­jected the re­quest.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Uni­fi­ca­tion, which han­dles re­la­tions with the North, said it has re­voked the li­cences of two groups – Fight­ers for a Free North Korea and Kuen­saem Ed­u­ca­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“The groups’ dis­tri­bu­tion of leaflets and goods to the North gravely hin­dered the gov­ern­ment’s uni­fi­ca­tion pol­icy and ef­forts to pro­mote it, caused dan­ger to the bor­der-area res­i­dents’ lives and safety, and cre­ated ten­sion,” the min­istry said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Last month, ten­sion flared af­ter North Korea, an­gry about the pro­pa­ganda leaflets, blew up a joint li­ai­son of­fice on its side of the bor­der and threat­ened mil­i­tary ac­tion.</p>
    <p>With­out a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO) li­cence, the groups will not get tax ex­emp­tions or be al­lowed to hold fund-rais­ers, though do­na­tions are still al­lowed.</p>
    <p>The two groups, along with rights or­gan­i­sa­tions, con­demned the gov­ern­ment ac­tion as a bid to si­lence voices crit­i­cal of the North in the in­ter­est of its po­lit­i­cal agenda.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has shown a track record of us­ing leg­isla­tive and ad­min­is­tra­tive mea­sures to pres­sure NGOs into act­ing... in line with the pol­icy agenda of the day: friendly re­la­tions with North Korea,” a coali­tion of groups said in a pe­ti­tion it said it had sent to the United Na­tions.</p>
    <p>Seoul’s move is likely to trig­ger de­bate over po­ten­tial in­fringe­ments of free­dom of ex­pres­sion in the demo­cratic South.</p>
    <p>Mr Park Sang-hak, the leader of one of the groups, said the South Korean gov­ern­ment has “de­prived us of the most im­por­tant value of democ­racy, which is free­dom”.</p>
    <p>The Hu­man Rights Watch has con­demned the South’s moves, call­ing them “shame­ful”. “In­stead of propos­ing a blan­ket ban on send­ing bal­loons with mes­sages and ma­te­ri­als to the North, Pres­i­dent Moon should pub­licly de­mand that North Korea re­spect free­dom of ex­pres­sion and stop cen­sor­ing what North Kore­ans can see,” Mr Phil Robert­son, the group’s deputy Asia direc­tor, said in a state­ment last month.</p>
