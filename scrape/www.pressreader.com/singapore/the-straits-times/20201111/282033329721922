    <p>The po­lice have ar­rested a 19-yearold man for his sus­pected in­volve­ment in a case of cheat­ing by im­per­son­ation.</p>
    <p>Two other men, aged 20 and 35, are as­sist­ing in po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the po­lice said they re­ceived a re­port on Oct 17 that three men were be­lieved to have im­per­son­ated safe dis­tanc­ing en­force­ment of­fi­cers (EOs) in the vicin­ity of a shop­ping mall at 3 Gate­way Drive.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that the three men claimed to be from an or­gan­i­sa­tion named “SG United”.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said that through ground in­quiries and fol­low-up in­ves­ti­ga­tions, of­fi­cers from</p>
    <p>Cle­menti Po­lice Di­vi­sion es­tab­lished the iden­ti­ties of the men and their role in the case.</p>
    <p>It was con­firmed that they were not hired by any gov­ern­ment agen­cies and were not au­tho­rised to per­form safe dis­tanc­ing en­force­ment du­ties.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing. Cheat­ing by im­per­son­ation is an of­fence that car­ries a jail term of up to five years, a fine, or both.</p>
    <p>The po­lice re­minded the pub­lic that EOs and am­bas­sadors can be iden­ti­fied by their safe dis­tanc­ing en­force­ment of­fi­cer and am­bas­sador passes, or the SG Clean Am­bas­sador pass, when they are per­form­ing safe dis­tanc­ing du­ties. EOs may also wear a red arm­band.</p>
    <p>Be­sides po­lice of­fi­cers, EOs are the only other au­tho­rised per­son­nel who can take en­force­ment ac­tion such as is­su­ing com­po­si­tion fines for breaches of safe dis­tanc­ing and safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Am­bas­sadors help to ad­vise and guide busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als in com­ply­ing with the mea­sures, but do not take en­force­ment ac­tion.</p>
    <p>No­tices for fines are is­sued to of­fend­ers in hard copy on site, or by mail.</p>
    <p>The po­lice added that mem­bers of the pub­lic will never be asked to make pay­ment in cash on the spot, or to pro­vide bank ac­count de­tails or one-time pass­words to make pay­ment.</p>
