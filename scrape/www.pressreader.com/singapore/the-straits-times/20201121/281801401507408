    <p>OUT­RA­GEOUS BE­HAV­IOUR</p>
    <p>(Don­ald Trump would) go down in his­tory as be­ing one of the most ir­re­spon­si­ble pres­i­dents... Far from me to ques­tion his mo­tives, it’s just out­ra­geous what he’s do­ing. ’’</p>
    <p>PRES­I­DENT-ELECT JOE BI­DEN, on US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bid en has as­sailed the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’ s lack of co­op­er­a­tion on the pres­i­den­tial tran­si­tion, which he says hin­ders his team’s abil­ity to get upto-date in­for­ma­tion on the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said he could not “fathom” Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede the elec­tion, say­ing he would “go down in his­tory as be­ing one of the most ir­re­spon­si­ble pres­i­dents”.</p>
    <p>“Far from me to ques­tion his mo­tives, it’s just out­ra­geous what he’s do­ing,” Mr Bi­den said, re­fer­ring to Mr Trump’s le­gal ma­noeu­vres to over­turn the elec­tion re­sult.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den called on the ad­min­is­tra­tion to al­low his team to get de­tails on a coro­n­avirus vac­cine and plans for dis­tri­bu­tion. “I would like to know ex­actly what this ad­min­is­tra­tion has in mind in terms of their Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed and how they plan it,” he said.</p>
    <p>He said he has not ruled out le­gal ac­tion to force the hand of the Gen­eral Ser­vices Ad­min­is­tra­tion, which has so far de­clined to sign an as­cer­tain­ment that Mr Bi­den likely won the elec­tion and free up money and ac­cess to gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials. Un­til the pa­per­work is signed, he can­not get na­tional se­cu­rity brief­ings or real-time data on the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect also spoke to gov­er­nors, who briefed him on the sta­tus of the pan­demic in their states as the virus surges around the coun­try. “Gov­er­nors made clear that beat­ing Covid-19 will re­quire all of us work­ing to­gether,” he said.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that state and lo­cal bud­gets have been dev­as­tated by pan­demic-re­lated slow­downs, Mr Bi­den said: “We’ve got to come to­gether. The fed­eral gov­ern­ment has to de­liver this re­lief.”</p>
    <p>Bi­den ad­vis­ers have warned of se­ri­ous con­se­quences if the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion con­tin­ues to deny ac­cess to the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, es­pe­cially with re­gard to real-time data about the pan­demic and plans for dis­tribut­ing a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, in the strong­est crit­i­cism of Mr Trump by a fel­low high­rank­ing Repub­li­can, Sen­a­tor Mitt Rom­ney of Utah on Thurs­day night ex­co­ri­ated the Pres­i­dent on Twit­ter for his con­tin­u­ing and over­whelm­ingly un­suc­cess­ful ef­forts to over­turn his elec­tion de­feat.</p>
    <p>Mr Rom­ney, the 2012 Repub­li­can pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee, said that the Pres­i­dent had ex­hausted his le­gal chal­lenges in sev­eral bat­tle­ground states and re­sorted to try­ing to defy the will of the vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“It is dif­fi­cult to imag­ine a worse, more un­demo­cratic ac­tion by a sit­ting Amer­i­can pres­i­dent,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>His re­buke of Mr Trump came on the same day that the Pres­i­dent in­vited Repub­li­can state lead­ers in Michi­gan to the White House to dis­cuss their ef­forts to stop the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of the elec­tion re­sults in the state.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign’s lat­est strat­egy, as de­scribed by three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the plan, is to con­vince Repub­li­can-con­trolled leg­is­la­tures in bat­tle­ground states won by Mr Bi­den, such as Michi­gan, to un­der­mine the re­sults.</p>
    <p>“The en­tire elec­tion, frankly, in all the swing states should be over­turned and the leg­is­la­tures should make sure that the elec­tors are se­lected for Trump,” Mr Sid­ney Pow­ell, one of Mr Trump’s lawyers, told Fox Busi­ness tele­vi­sion on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Ben Sasse of Ne­braska said in a state­ment on Thurs­day night that it was telling that Mr Trump’s cam­paign lawyers had re­fused to “ac­tu­ally al­lege grand fraud”.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause there are le­gal con­se­quences for ly­ing to judges,” said Mr Sasse.</p>
