    <p>Fans of Philip Pull­man’s His Dark Ma­te­ri­als fan­tasy nov­els have been di­vided over the mer­its of the tele­vi­sion adap­ta­tion that de­buted last year, which re­ceived mixed re­views and made changes to the books that dis­pleased some fans.</p>
    <p>And while he counts him­self as one of those fans, the mul­ti­tal­ented Lin-Manuel Mi­randa knows all too well how hard it is to adapt a beloved lit­er­ary work.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the Pulitzer-, Emmy-, Grammy- and Tony­win­ning cre­ator of the mu­si­cal Hamil­ton – which pre­miered in 2015 and be­came a cul­tural phe­nom­e­non – is de­vel­op­ing a sim­i­lar project of his own: a TV show based on an­other fan­tasy fran­chise, The Kingkiller Chron­i­cle se­ries by Pa­trick Roth­fuss.</p>
    <p>So Mi­randa – an ac­tor, singer, com­poser and play­wright – was tak­ing notes when he joined the cast of His Dark Ma­te­ri­als, which re­turned this week for a se­cond sea­son on HBO Go and HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420), with new episodes on Tues­days at 10am and 10pm.</p>
    <p>He plays aero­naut Lee Scoresby, one of the colour­ful char­ac­ters pro­tag­o­nist Lyra (Dafne Keen) en­coun­ters as she jour­neys through par­al­lel uni­verses on a dan­ger­ous mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the press by video call from his New York home, the 40-year-old is asked what he learnt in terms of the dos and don’ts of tak­ing elab­o­rate works of fic­tion and trans­lat­ing them into a dif­fer­ent medium.</p>
    <p>“I think what I learnt was there’s never enough time when you have worlds this rich,” he says.</p>
    <p>“When I first heard that His Dark Ma­te­ri­als was be­ing turned into a se­ries, I was so re­lieved be­cause Philip Pull­man cre­ated not just a rich uni­verse but, lit­er­ally, rich ‘mul­ti­verses’. So, fi­nally, we have the time to re­ally ex­plore those worlds.”</p>
    <p>But as they filmed Sea­son 2 of His Dark Ma­te­ri­als – which sees Lyra jour­ney­ing to a mys­te­ri­ous aban­doned city – he saw that the cre­ators still had to make tough ed­i­to­rial calls and kill some of their dar­lings.</p>
    <p>“I was, like, ‘It’s eight hours and it’s still not enough time.’ You’re still hav­ing to pick and choose and cut.”</p>
    <p>He says he and his col­lab­o­ra­tors are “fac­ing a sim­i­lar thing” with the long-awaited The Kingkiller Chron­i­cle se­ries.</p>
    <p>As with His Dark Ma­te­ri­als, the books fea­ture a complex nar­ra­tive struc­ture and mythol­ogy as they lay out the ori­gin story of a man who even­tu­ally be­comes one of the world’s most pow­er­ful wiz­ards.</p>
    <p>“The world is so vast,” Mi­randa adds. “While there was op­ti­mism in (the ini­tial idea of) mak­ing a movie of Pa­trick’s in­cred­i­ble first book, I don’t know that there was enough time.”</p>
    <p>“And hav­ing worked on His Dark Ma­te­ri­als, I don’t know that a se­ries is enough time,” he says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves the so­lu­tion, how­ever, is to find “a di­rec­tor who re­ally has a vi­sion for it that trans­forms it – be­cause there’s just so much book there”.</p>
    <p>But Mi­randa – who is mar­ried with two chil­dren – be­lieves it is pos­si­ble to craft a good adap­ta­tion “when you love a world this much”.</p>
    <p>He has also been busy this year com­pos­ing songs for Dis­ney’s live-ac­tion re­make of The Lit­tle Mer­maid, due out next No­vem­ber.</p>
    <p>“I mean, how many decades have we spent in the Star Wars world and we still feel there’s not enough time?</p>
    <p>“That’s sort of the pit­fall when you have these imag­i­na­tive writ­ers cre­at­ing such rich worlds,” he says.</p>
    <p>He also thinks the fan­tasy genre is the per­fect ve­hi­cle for smug­gling in other ideas and gen­res, and in His Dark Ma­te­ri­als, there are many of those threaded through the story.</p>
    <p>“I think the big­gest one is free­dom ver­sus op­pres­sion, and I can’t tell you how rel­e­vant it is when Lyra’s fa­ther presents ev­i­dence of this other world, and this op­pres­sive force seeks to squash in­for­ma­tion of it.</p>
    <p>“That’s a tale as old as time and, sadly, is ever­green, whether it’s (me­di­ae­val astronomer) Coper­ni­cus say­ing, ‘Hey, the sun doesn’t go around us – we go around the sun’, or cli­mate sci­ence to­day – and the truth is stymied.”</p>
    <p>His Dark Ma­te­ri­als 2 airs on Tues­days at 10am and 10pm on HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420) and also streams on HBO Go.</p>
