    <p>Sin­ga­pore should recog­nise the re­al­ity of a new US-China Cold War, one that in­volves a global bat­tle for elite and pub­lic opin­ion. In this re­spect, Sin­ga­pore should recog­nise its strate­gic po­si­tion and safe­guard its in­tel­lec­tual in­de­pen­dence, says Pro­fes­sor Yuen Yuen Ang.</p>
    <p>It’s been eight months into the year, but it feels as if eight years have passed. 2020 has been more than event­ful – it marks a wa­ter­shed in world pol­i­tics: US-China re­la­tions have sunk to their low­est point since for­mal re­la­tions were es­tab­lished 40 years ago.</p>
    <p>Are China and the United States in a new Cold War? Of­fi­cials in Bei­jing have stren­u­ously ob­jected to new Cold War lan­guage, while pedan­tic schol­ars may ar­gue that Amer­i­can-Soviet ri­valry af­ter 1945 is un­like the present times. But this is all ir­rel­e­vant to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Like it or not, from Sin­ga­pore’s per­spec­tive, we are fac­ing a new Cold War.</p>
    <p>The term un­der­scores the re­al­ity that US-China com­pe­ti­tion has erupted on mul­ti­ple fronts and will likely be pro­longed. In Capi­tol Hill, the mind­set of the old Cold War still per­sists, thus re­vis­it­ing his­tory is in­struc­tive. The new Cold War is not a con­test over ide­ol­ogy, but a bat­tle for elite and pub­lic opin­ion around the world. In this re­spect, Sin­ga­pore should recog­nise its strate­gic po­si­tion and safe­guard its in­tel­lec­tual in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>THE OLD V NEW COLD WAR</p>
    <p>For starters, what was the Cold War? In 1946, then Soviet Union Pre­mier Joseph Stalin gave a speech that pit­ted cap­i­tal­ism and so­cial­ism as two fun­da­men­tally op­posed ide­olo­gies. The year af­ter, Mr Ge­orge Ken­nan, an Amer­i­can diplo­mat, penned an anony­mous ar­ti­cle un­der the name “X” in For­eign Af­fairs mag­a­zine, which laid out the pol­icy of “con­tain­ment”.</p>
    <p>This fa­mous “X ar­ti­cle” be­came the com­pass of US strat­egy against the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>As Mr Ken­nan wrote, the end goal of con­tain­ment was “ei­ther the break-up or the grad­ual mel­low­ing of Soviet power” – mean­ing, only one side can be left stand­ing. It is “long term”, “pa­tient but firm” and also “de­signed to con­front the</p>
    <p>Rus­sians with un­al­ter­able coun­ter­force at ev­ery point where they show signs of en­croach­ing”.</p>
    <p>The re­sult of this vi­sion was a Cold War that lasted more than 40 years. De­terred by the threat of mu­tual an­ni­hi­la­tion in a nu­clear war, the US and Soviet Union avoided mil­i­tary con­flict. In­stead, they fought “proxy bat­tles” in satel­lite states, drag­ging much of the world into their com­pe­ti­tion. This war fi­nally came to an end in 1991, with the dis­so­lu­tion of the Soviet Union and the tri­umph of the US.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with US-Soviet ri­valry, the com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the US and China to­day is ob­vi­ously dif­fer­ent in many ways. While the Soviet Union shut it­self out of free trade and mar­kets, China’s econ­omy is in­ex­tri­ca­bly cou­pled with the Amer­i­can and global cap­i­tal­ist econ­omy. The old Cold War was a bat­tle of ide­ol­ogy, but post-1978, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party has no ide­ol­ogy in prac­tice, ex­cept for its twin goals of main­tain­ing sin­gle-party rule and achiev­ing eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>Not­with­stand­ing these dif­fer­ences, what mat­ters is how Wash­ing­ton chooses to per­ceive Bei­jing. Bear in mind that the ma­jor­ity of power-hold­ers in Amer­ica had lived through the Cold War, a for­ma­tive ex­pe­ri­ence that pre­dis­poses them to see the world in terms of op­pos­ing ide­olo­gies and lurk­ing en­e­mies. Fur­ther­more, as the past taught them, great power com­pe­ti­tion ends with one winner, not co-ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>More­over, ide­ol­ogy is re­in­forced by prac­ti­cal in­cen­tives. In a na­tion splin­tered by hyper-par­ti­san­ship, be­ing hawk­ish on China has be­come one of the few causes that can unite Repub­li­cans and Democrats. As Sen­a­tor Chris Coons, a Demo­crat, ob­served, this is “com­pa­ra­ble to the 1950s when there was no down­side, po­lit­i­cally, to be­ing anti-Soviet”.</p>
    <p>Feel­ing vic­timised, many Chi­nese be­moan: What has China done to de­serve such an­i­mos­ity from the US? In truth, it takes two hands to clap. Chi­nese leader Xi Jin­ping has courted Amer­ica’s alarm on two fronts. At home, he re­vived au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism and statist eco­nomic poli­cies. Overseas, he</p>
    <p>The Sino-Amer­i­can ri­valry is not just a war over trade and tech­nol­ogy, but a war over nar­ra­tives. This sim­mered over the past years, and this year, it reached a boil­ing point: The US and China fought bare-fisted over who is to be blamed for the pan­demic. Both ac­cused each other of pro­pa­ganda. At stake is global pub­lic opin­ion.</p>
    <p>pro­jected am­bi­tion to cre­ate a China-cen­tred global or­der.</p>
    <p>AC­TI­VAT­ING THE COLD WAR</p>
    <p>Once Wash­ing­ton’s Cold War men­tal­ity was ac­ti­vated, it trig­gered a se­ries of es­ca­lat­ing fric­tions be­tween the US and</p>
    <p>China, be­gin­ning in trade and tech­nol­ogy, but spilling over into a con­test for soft power, su­pe­ri­or­ity of de­vel­op­ment models, dom­i­nance in in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions, and more. Given that this is a ri­valry on all fronts short of bul­lets and bombs, it is a new Cold War.</p>
    <p>Still, there ap­peared to be room for rec­on­cil­i­a­tion at the start of the year. On Jan 15, China and the US signed the first phase of their trade agree­ment. I re­mem­ber this date clearly be­cause on that day, I spoke at a panel on US-China tech­nol­ogy com­pe­ti­tion at the Asia So­ci­ety. There was a mood of hope in the air. No one knew, how­ever, that as we were speak­ing, the coro­n­avirus was break­ing out in Wuhan.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has in­au­gu­rated the new Cold War.</p>
    <p>Since the out­break, mu­tual finger-point­ing be­tween the US and China has poi­soned pub­lic opin­ion, in ef­fect boost­ing hawks and na­tion­al­ists on both sides. Ac­cord­ing to a Pew sur­vey con­ducted in March, neg­a­tive views of China among Amer­i­cans soared to a record high of 66 per cent, com­pared with 29 per cent in 2006. Mean­while, na­tion­al­ism is surg­ing in China.</p>
    <p>IM­PLI­CA­TIONS FOR SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of whether Demo­cratic con­tender Joe Bi­den or cur­rent US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump takes of­fice next year, the con­sen­sus on “stand­ing up to China” is not go­ing away. Nor can Chi­nese lead­ers af­ford to look weak be­fore Amer­i­can hos­til­ity. In this Cold War cli­mate, it is all the more im­por­tant that Sin­ga­pore for­mu­late in­de­pen­dent and Sin­ga­pore-cen­tred viewpoints on US-China re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>For any given is­sue, what is rel­e­vant to Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing isn’t nec­es­sar­ily rel­e­vant to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in Wash­ing­ton, the Cold War anal­ogy should be re­jected, be­cause as Dr Evans Medeiros of Ge­orge­town Univer­sity ar­gues, it “di­min­ishes the com­plex­ity of the chal­lenge for US pol­i­cy­mak­ers”, who are al­ready com­pet­ing to cast China as an en­emy. Con­versely, Bei­jing des­per­ately wants to re­ject the Cold War anal­ogy be­cause it re­alises that chal­leng­ing Amer­i­can pri­macy comes at a heavy cost.</p>
    <p>This means that Sin­ga­pore can­not blindly im­port opin­ions and analy­ses from overseas. We should lis­ten to both su­per­pow­ers, but their mes­sages must be rein­ter­preted through the lens of Sin­ga­pore’s con­text and in­ter­ests and ex­plained to a Sin­ga­porean au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, the Sino-Amer­i­can ri­valry is not just a war over trade and tech­nol­ogy, but a war over nar­ra­tives. This sim­mered over the past years, and this year, it reached a boil­ing point: The US and China fought bare-fisted over who is to be blamed for the pan­demic. Both ac­cused each other of pro­pa­ganda. At stake is global pub­lic opin­ion.</p>
    <p>For any strate­gist, it is plain as day that no war over nar­ra­tives in Asia can be won with­out first win­ning over Sin­ga­pore. Though small in size, our is­land state is the gate­way to South-east Asia, and opin­ions ex­pressed in Sin­ga­pore can be widely ac­cessed in China. Hence, as the geopo­lit­i­cal con­test heats up, we ought to guard our in­de­pen­dence of mind and in­de­pen­dence of ex­pres­sion like a na­tional trea­sure.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, while this should be ob­vi­ous to many, it is worth stat­ing: Go­ing for­ward, pol­i­tics must be at the front and cen­tre of any di­ag­no­sis. Eco­nomic fore­casts alone will not suf­fice be­cause they are premised upon rel­a­tively sta­ble and “nor­mal” geopo­lit­i­cal con­di­tions. Un­cer­tainty is the new nor­mal. As such, pro­ject­ing and pre­par­ing for dif­fer­ent sce­nar­ios in US-China re­la­tions, how­ever un­think­able they seem now, should be­come a stan­dard di­ag­nos­tic tool.</p>
    <p>In the rosiest sce­nario, Sino-Amer­i­can con­flict may de-es­ca­late af­ter the US elec­tions in Novem­ber. More likely, how­ever, what we have seen in the past months is a har­bin­ger of worse to come. For Sin­ga­pore, calling the cur­rent con­text a new Cold War pushes us to gear up for the great­est geopo­lit­i­cal test of our times.</p>
