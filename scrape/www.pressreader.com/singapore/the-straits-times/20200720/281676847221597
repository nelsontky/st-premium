    <p>A new town coun­cil that will serve both Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC and the new Mary­mount SMC has been formed, said De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng, 61, told The Straits Times that Ms Gan Siow Huang, 45, the newly elected MP for Mary­mount, has been ap­pointed as one of the town coun­cil’s two vice-chair­men.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong Kee Hiong, 54, is the new Bis­han-Toa Payoh Town Coun­cil’s chair­man, while Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat, 46, is the other vice-chair­man. The two re-elected MPs are repris­ing the roles they held with the pre­vi­ous town coun­cil.</p>
    <p>One of the key cam­paign prom­ises by Dr Ng and Ms Gan dur­ing the hus­tings was that res­i­dents in Mary­mount, Bis­han and Toa Payoh would con­tinue to be served by the same town coun­cil to en­sure cost-ef­fec­tive­ness and</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post last night, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Janil Puthuc­heary said both PRPTC and AMKTC are ready to carry out a smooth han­dover, as high main­te­nance stan­dards.</p>
    <p>The Mary­mount sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency, which com­prises the Hous­ing Board blocks in Bis­han Streets 22 to 25, Shunfu and parts of Sin Ming, was carved out of Bis­hanToa Payoh GRC for the gen­eral elec­tion this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan won the new sin­gle seat soon as Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC) is ready.</p>
    <p>“There is an es­tab­lished process pre­scribed by MND for such han­dovers, and we will fa­cil­i­tate this to make it as smooth as pos­si­ble,” he with 55.04 per cent of the votes, while a team com­pris­ing Dr Ng, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try and Ed­u­ca­tion Chee Hong Tat, Mr Sak­tiandi and Mr Chong re­tained the GRC, beat­ing the Sin­ga­pore Peo­ple’s Party for the third time with 67.23 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>To thank vot­ers and res­i­dents, Dr Ng and the four other MPs vis­ited eight mar­kets across the two con­stituen­cies yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Ng: “We wanted to con­duct these mar­ket vis­its across the GRC and Mary­mount to start our work as ad­vis­ers and MPs in ful­fill­ing our prom­ises dur­ing the cam­paign, es­pe­cially to take care of fam­i­lies in need and im­prov­ing towns. We are vis­it­ing as five ad­vis­ers as we had made this prom­ise.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters after the vis­its, Ms Gan said she will play an ac­tive role in en­sur­ing the needs and in­ter­ests of Mary­mount res­i­dents are met. Said the for­mer Republic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force brigadier-gen­eral: “There is a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence al­ready built up in the pre­vi­ous town coun­cil. There is a strong team there that knows ev­ery corner of the neigh­bour­hood well. So I’m glad that we are con­tin­u­ing with this sin­gle town coun­cil that can best sup­port the res­i­dents.”</p>
    <p>Ms Gan held her first Meet-thePeo­ple Ses­sion last Tues­day over email and video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom. She said res­i­dents who ap­proached her had two main is­sues – es­tate main­te­nance and jobs.</p>
    <p>Asked if she would con­tinue in her post as deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) now that she has been elected as an MP, Ms Gan said she was in­clined to stay on in her role. “Be­ing part of the labour move­ment and be­ing part of e2i will give me more ca­pac­ity and abil­ity to help,” she said.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, I must ask my­self what value I can bring to the team and to the res­i­dents.”</p>
    <p>Nei­ther Dr Ng nor Ms Gan would be drawn into com­ment­ing on the rea­sons be­hind the na­tional vote swing against the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party at GE2020.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Gan: “The anal­y­sis is still on­go­ing. It is im­por­tant that we un­der­stand the is­sues at the na­tional level, yes, but also at the con­stituency level. I think each con­stituency has its own unique (is­sues) and we’ll be do­ing a re­view to­gether with my team.”</p>
