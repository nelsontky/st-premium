    <p>Six-time world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton over­took Michael Schu­macher by win­ning his 92nd ca­reer For­mula One race in yes­ter­day’s Por­tuguese Grand Prix. And with a gap­ing 77-point lead in the driv­ers’ cham­pi­onship with only five races to go, he will al­most cer­tainly tie Schu­macher on a record seven ti­tles.</p>
    <p>(Por­tu­gal) Six-time world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton be­came the most suc­cess­ful For­mula One driver of all time in terms of race wins yes­ter­day with a dom­i­nant 92nd ca­reer vic­tory at the Por­tuguese Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>The Mercedes driver, who took the che­quered flag a mas­sive 25.592 sec­onds ahead of sec­ond-placed team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas, had equalled Fer­rari great Michael Schu­macher’s record 91 wins at the pre­vi­ous race at the Nur­bur­gring.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory, along with a bonus point for fastest lap, stretched the Bri­ton’s cham­pi­onship lead over the Finn to 77 points with five races re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>“You are re-writ­ing the his­tory books,” Mercedes tech­ni­cians told Hamil­ton over the team ra­dio, with Aus­trian team boss Toto Wolff say­ing: “Lewis, 92, 92”.</p>
    <p>“I owe it all to these guys here and back at the fac­tory,” said the six­time world cham­pion, who was joined on the podium by Sil­ver Ar­rows race en­gi­neer Peter “Bono” Bon­ning­ton af­ter set­ting his big­gest win mar­gin this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“It’s just been such a priv­i­lege work­ing with them. To­day was tough but it was all about tem­per­a­tures.”</p>
    <p>Dutch­man Max Ver­stap­pen fin­ished third for Red Bull at the Al­garve cir­cuit that was host­ing the coun­try’s first grand prix in 24 years.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton lapped all but the three driv­ers be­hind him, but it had not looked so sim­ple at the start when he dropped to third from pole po­si­tion on a lively open­ing lap with oc­ca­sional rain com­pli­cat­ing mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas, who had gone ahead, was then passed on lap 2 by McLaren’s Car­los Sainz, who had started seventh on the soft tyres, with the Mercedes pair strug­gling to get heat into the medium rub­ber.</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen had, mean­while, dropped to fifth af­ter tan­gling with Rac­ing Point’s Ser­gio Perez, who pit­ted and dropped to last but re­cov­ered to fin­ish seventh.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas re­took the lead on lap 6 as the tyres fired up, with Hamil­ton mov­ing up to sec­ond, and stayed ahead un­til his team­mate over­took him on lap 20 to lead for the first time since the open­ing lap.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton, whose fa­ther was at the cir­cuit to see his tri­umph, re­ported cramp with seven laps to go but then pro­ceeded to set a se­ries of fastest laps in Por­tu­gal – the 24th dif­fer­ent coun­try in which he has won. He has won in more coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore where he has four wins, than any other driver.</p>
    <p>“I could never have dreamed of be­ing where I am to­day,” he said af­ter his eighth win of the sea­son and 71st since join­ing Mercedes in 2013.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t have a magic ball when I chose to come to this team and part­ner with great peo­ple, but here I am and what I can tell you is I’m try­ing to make the most of it ev­ery sin­gle day. It’s go­ing to take some time to sink in. I was still push­ing flat out com­ing across the line. I have got my dad and my step­mum here so it’s a very good day.”</p>
    <p>His for­mer team McLaren tweeted their con­grat­u­la­tions, while Wolff told Sky Sports it was a re­mark­able achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton also holds the record num­ber of pole po­si­tions (97) and is odds-on to equal Schu­macher’s record of seven cham­pi­onships.</p>
    <p>“Who would’ve have thought when we started this project in 2013… it’s al­most a sur­real amount (of wins),” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s ab­so­lute pas­sion and en­ergy and ev­ery­thing he puts into the sport – and the tal­ent and the abil­ity. He’s just stand­ing out.</p>
    <p>“This sea­son, he has ramped up his week­end. It’s a lot of learn­ing, un­der­stand­ing the tyres and af­ter the first cou­ple of laps, he was just sit­ting com­fort­ably – then he just ramps it up even more.”</p>
    <p>On the like­li­hood of an ex­ten­sion, with Hamil­ton’s con­tract run­ning out at the end of the cam­paign, Wolff joked: “It’s huge! We have to sell plenty of in­ven­tory just to come up with the money.”</p>
