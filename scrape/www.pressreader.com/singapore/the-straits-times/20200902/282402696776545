    <p>The Ap­ple iMac, still the quin­tes­sen­tial all-in-one desk­top PC, has brushed off many a clone com­peti­tor over the years.</p>
    <p>But while its Win­dows com­peti­tors have been step­ping up with sleeker mod­els, the lat­est iMac 5K (27-inch, 2020) has the same de­sign that was last re­freshed in 2015. The changes are on the in­side. It now comes stan­dard with the lat­est 10th-gen­er­a­tion In­tel six- or eight-core pro­ces­sors as well as a new 10-core i9 op­tion.</p>
    <p>Its graph­ics pro­cess­ing unit (GPU) has been up­graded to the next-gen­er­a­tion AMD Radeon Pro 5000 se­ries, which is faster and more en­ergy-ef­fi­cient than those found in its pre­de­ces­sor last year.</p>
    <p>It also has solid-state drives (SSDs), which are faster than con­ven­tional disk drives. But the stor­age starts at a pal­try 256GB, when 512GB will be more op­ti­mal for to­day’s com­put­ing needs.</p>
    <p>Also rather pal­try is the base 8GB sys­tem mem­ory – the stan­dard op­tion even for the top model. At least 16GB is more ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the most im­por­tant up­grade is with the front-fac­ing, or FaceTime, cam­era, which now has a res­o­lu­tion of 1,080p (up from 720p). I look sig­nif­i­cantly bet­ter than be­fore dur­ing video-con­fer­enc­ing ses­sions, even in my dimly lit study. Plus, it comes with a face-de­tec­tion fea­ture to keep your face in sharp fo­cus all the time.</p>
    <p>The 5K dis­play now fea­tures True Tone tech­nol­ogy, which au­to­mat­i­cally changes a screen’s colour tem­per­a­ture to match the am­bi­ent light for more nat­u­ral-look­ing im­ages. There is also a nano-tex­ture glass op­tion that is said to sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce glare.</p>
    <p>With no de­sign change, the new iMac 5K still has an alu­minium body with a curved back that ta­pers to a 5mm-thick edge. Like its pre­de­ces­sors, all the ports, in­clud­ing the head­phone jack, are at the rear. This means you have to reach be­hind to in­sert an SD card or a USB ca­ble – a ma­jor in­con­ve­nience.</p>
    <p>The re­view unit is the top stan­dard model with an eight-core In­tel Core i7 pro­ces­sor, Radeon Pro 5500 XT (8GB of video mem­ory) GPU, 8GB of sys­tem mem­ory and 512GB of SSD stor­age. It does not have the op­tional nano-tex­ture glass so I am un­able to see if there is re­ally less glare as ad­ver­tised.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, the 5K dis­play re­mains gor­geous.</p>
    <p>Its bright­ness level is rated at 500 nits and it sup­ports up to one bil­lion colours as well as the P3 wide colour gamut for more vivid colours. With a su­per high res­o­lu­tion of 5,120 x 2,880 pix­els, you can see more de­tails when edit­ing pho­tos and videos.</p>
    <p>In terms of per­for­mance, the re­view unit scores 1,182 (sin­gle-core) and 7,220 (multi-core) in the Geek­bench 5 bench­mark­ing soft­ware. In com­par­i­son, last year’s iMac 5K (with In­tel Core i7) scores 765 (sin­gle-core) and 4,517 (multi-core).</p>
    <p>I find no vis­i­ble lags when edit­ing 4K videos us­ing Fi­nal Cut Pro X (FCP X) and edit­ing pic­tures in Pix­el­ma­tor Pro (PP). Not to men­tion, PP’s Ma­chine Learn­ing Su­per Res­o­lu­tion up­scal­ing imag­ing fea­ture takes just three sec­onds to ap­ply.</p>
    <p>There are no per­for­mance is­sues or spin­ning rain­bow wheels, too, when I open 10 to 12 tabs in both the Sa­fari and Chrome Web browsers and run mul­ti­ple apps such as Mail, FCP X, PP and Pre­view, while writ­ing this re­view all at the same time.</p>
    <p>Like its pre­de­ces­sor, the iMac 5K is not cheap. While prices start at $2,599, a fully souped-up iMac (with nano-tex­ture glass dis­play, 10-core pro­ces­sor, 128GB of sys­tem mem­ory and 8TB of SSD) costs $12,929.</p>
    <p>This might be the last iMac to fea­ture the In­tel pro­ces­sor, with Ap­ple mov­ing to its own pro­ces­sors soon. Who knows, you might end up with a piece of com­put­ing his­tory if you get this ver­sion.</p>
