    <p>Of all things in sport, in­ven­tion is per­haps the most de­light­ful and suf­fer­ing the most ab­sorb­ing. Marathon­ers en­thral me, so do soli­tary row­ers across oceans, Arc­tic swim­mers whose frozen hands can’t grip the wa­ter and desert walk­ers who leave toe­nails in the sand. The other day I got an e-mail from a Sin­ga­porean who is train­ing for the Iron­man 70.3 World Cham­pi­onship which has been post­poned to 2022. He is 72 won­der­ful years old.</p>
    <p>“There is still some fight in me yet,” he wrote and it is in­spir­ing. Pris­ing com­mit­ment out of the self is an un­com­monly beau­ti­ful thing. It is why we ad­mire ath­letes, pre­cisely for this dis­ci­pline, and in a Covid time it is some­thing to im­i­tate. Af­ter all, the finest virtue right now is to per­sist.</p>
    <p>Of course peo­ple fall short, even that sneak­ered sage Eliud Kip­choge, who came eighth in the London Marathon and said: “I’m re­ally dis­ap­pointed but this is sport. It’s not the end of the world. I have more marathons. I will come back again.”</p>
    <p>So will we.</p>
    <p>Kip­choge’s words are worth hang­ing on to for we’re all strug­gling, with masks, safety mea­sures, lim­its. On a bas­ket­ball court, three must play against two for only five are al­lowed on court. It’s un­com­fort­able but so is sport. It’s tough but, to use the Kenyan’s words, it’s not the end of the world. The virus has come with a cost but at least we can still play and we’re still alive. That’s price­less.</p>
    <p>My col­leagues did a re­cent piece on peo­ple flout­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, like too many bas­ket­ballers on one court than is al­lowed, and it brought a small smile and a long sigh. Sport has an in­stinc­tive el­e­ment of re­bel­lion, doesn’t it, and ath­letes are al­ways try­ing to get away with some­thing. It’s just that in a time of Covid the con­se­quences of rule break­ing are more pro­found.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and en­force­ment of­fi­cers are the new ref­er­ees and while we’re pro­grammed to ar­gue with authority in sport, just think of them for a minute. They’d rather be home and safe than try­ing to rea­son with testos­terone-filled, non-vig­i­lant folk who might see them as wan­der­ing spoil­sports.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes, for all their pol­ished egos, mostly obey di­rec­tives be­cause they’re taught to think in terms of team. The group over­rides the hair-gelled self. The same phi­los­o­phy ap­plies now, ex­cept that the idea of team has changed.</p>
    <p>The team now is all of us, it’s the en­force­ment of­fi­cer, the next-door neigh­bour, the lady ahead of you in the su­per­mar­ket line, the grandpa in the lift, the kid at the next ta­ble. To scorn a safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sure is not to just let down a team but to pos­si­bly en­dan­ger it.</p>
    <p>All the things we wisely preach to our sport­ing teams – stick to a plan, be obe­di­ent to an idea, stay con­sis­tent, be grate­ful – is what we need from our­selves. Of course we’re al­lowed to grum­ble – think of it as a fun­da­men­tal right – and yet we also need to con­sider our for­tune.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, a swimmer I know who is chas­ing an Olympic spot, is still wait­ing to train. Pools where he lives aren’t open still and we’ve got to make sure our fa­cil­i­ties don’t close. If peo­ple ig­nore rules which leads to the au­thor­i­ties shut­ting down courts, then they’re do­ing their fel­low cit­i­zens a dis­ser­vice. You can’t shout, “Don’t hog the ball” at your TV and then em­brace acts of self­ish­ness your­self.</p>
    <p>Vi­o­lat­ing safety mea­sures is some­times in­ad­ver­tent, for peo­ple go out to play not to dis­rupt. But pent-up ex­u­ber­ance blunts com­mon sense and any­way a long fight is sap­ping the spirit. But I look, as I of­ten do, to the adventurer for as­sis­tance, to Lewis Pugh, the UN Pa­tron of the Oceans, whom I have quoted be­fore dur­ing this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In late Septem­ber he posted a pic­ture of him­self on Twit­ter, swim­ming past an ice­berg, and wrote this of his chal­lenges:</p>
    <p>“The temp­ta­tion to quit will be strong­est shortly af­ter you’ve be­gun, and just be­fore you fin­ish. If you’re aware of it, you can avoid it...</p>
    <p>“When you start, it can be over­whelm­ing and much harder than you ex­pected. Like­wise, when you are near the end, you are ex­hausted and need the grit to fin­ish the job.”</p>
    <p>Who knows if we’re to­wards the end, but let’s pre­tend we are. Let’s think we’re Rafa in the fifth set and noth­ing is cer­tain ex­cept that we have to stay true to our tac­tics and keep push­ing. It doesn’t mat­ter if the five-per­son limit for sport or so­cial gath­er­ings gets ex­tended to eight or 10 be­cause the chal­lenge be­fore us scarcely al­ters.</p>
    <p>Like the man across the net, this virus will be con­quered only by con­vic­tion and com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>The team now is all of us, it’s the en­force­ment of­fi­cer, the next-door neigh­bour, the lady ahead of you in the su­per­mar­ket line, the grandpa in the lift, the kid at the next ta­ble. To scorn a safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sure is not to just let down a team but to pos­si­bly en­dan­ger it.</p>
