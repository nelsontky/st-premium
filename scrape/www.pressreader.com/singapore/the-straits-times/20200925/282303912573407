    <p>The Covid-19 re­ces­sion will have a more be­nign and shorter-lived im­pact on the of­fice leas­ing mar­ket in the Asia-Pa­cific – ex­clud­ing Greater China – than else­where, and the re­gion will take just a mar­ginal hit from the work-from-home phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>This is ac­cord­ing to real es­tate ser­vices firm Cush­man & Wake­field (C&W), which noted that all the economies in the re­gion are set to see gross do­mes­tic prod­uct re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els by the third quar­ter of next year in the base­line sce­nario.</p>
    <p>The slow­down in the cre­ation of new of­fice-us­ing jobs as well as out­right job losses will chal­lenge of­fice leas­ing fun­da­men­tals over the next six to 18 months, C&W noted in a re­port pub­lished yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>That said, de­mand – as mea­sured by net ab­sorp­tion – in the re­gion is fore­cast to re­main pos­i­tive from now through 2030.</p>
    <p>Net ab­sorp­tion in the Asia-Pa­cific this year will plunge by 70 per cent from last year to about 21 mil­lion sq ft un­der the base­line sce­nario, the firm pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>This rep­re­sents an ab­sorp­tion rate of 2 per cent, the low­est since record-keep­ing be­gan in 2007.</p>
    <p>Next year, net ab­sorp­tion is ex­pected to mod­er­ately im­prove to 28 mil­lion sq ft, C&W said.</p>
    <p>From 2022 to 2030, the firm fore­sees net of­fice de­mand grow­ing by 729 mil­lion sq ft in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>This will be de­spite a 4.5 per cent drag as a re­sult of more em­ploy­ees work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>“In­creased flex­i­ble work­ing and work-from-home prac­tices are less preva­lent across the Asia-Pa­cific as a whole com­pared with other re­gions, and so do not mean­ing­fully al­ter the out­look for the re­gion’s of</p>
    <p>The slow­down in the cre­ation of new of­fice-us­ing jobs as well as out­right job losses will chal­lenge of­fice leas­ing fun­da­men­tals over the next six to 18 months, C&W noted in a re­port pub­lished yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>fice mar­ket,” said Dr Do­minic Brown, head of in­sight and anal­y­sis for the re­gion at the firm.</p>
    <p>There is early ev­i­dence that the Asia-Pa­cific will be some­what more re­silient rel­a­tive to other global re­gions, even though it is still not im­mune to the pan­demic’s im­pact.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, net ab­sorp­tion in the United States dur­ing the sec­ond quar­ter of this year was mi­nus 23.1 mil­lion sq ft, ver­sus 2.9 mil­lion sq ft in the re­gion. In terms of the Asia-Pa­cific’s of­fice em­ploy­ment base, the de­mo­graphic growth in emerg­ing mar­kets helps to mit­i­gate over­all of­fice-job losses.</p>
    <p>Emerg­ing mar­kets such as In­dia, In­done­sia, Malaysia and the Philip­pines are likely to see more jobs that are of­fice-us­ing, as their economies move rapidly up the value chain.</p>
    <p>Of­fice rents in emerg­ing mar­kets will there­fore see just a shal­low and short de­cline of 2.6 per cent over the next 18 months, be­fore re­turn­ing to pre-pan­demic lev­els in the fourth quar­ter of 2022 with con­tin­ued growth af­ter that.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the more ad­vanced mar­kets – in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and South Korea – will ex­pe­ri­ence lower de­mand for of­fices, which will flow through to weaker rental growth.</p>
    <p>A sharper peak-to-trough rental de­cline of 21.3 per cent is fore­cast over the next 21 months for of­fices in the re­gion’s ad­vanced mar­kets, af­ter fac­tor­ing in the more se­vere em­ploy­ment de­clines and more elas­tic rent re­sponses to de­clin­ing oc­cu­pancy lev­els.</p>
    <p>Ag­gre­gate rents in the ad­vanced economies will re­turn to preCovid-19 lev­els only in 2026, ac­cord­ing to C&W.</p>
    <p>Dr Brown noted that the re­gion had en­tered the Covid-19 cri­sis with a “for­mi­da­ble sup­ply pipe­line, with a ro­bust wave of of­fice devel­op­ment slated for de­liv­ery in 2020-2022”.</p>
    <p>More than 211 mil­lion sq ft of new sup­ply is ex­pected by end-2022.</p>
    <p>As such, even be­fore the pan­demic, Asia-Pa­cific mar­kets were al­ready soft­en­ing as va­can­cies rose and rents fell. This trend is set to in­ten­sify, based on the real es­tate firm’s fore­casts.</p>
    <p>Va­can­cies in the re­gion will likely peak at 16.7 per cent in late 2021 and stay el­e­vated for the fol­low­ing year, be­fore de­creas­ing more rapidly.</p>
    <p>That va­cancy level is over 500 ba­sis points above pre-pan­demic lev­els in the fourth quar­ter of last year, and will be the high­est on record, C&W said.</p>
    <p>As for Greater China, the up­trend in va­cancy rates even be­fore the pan­demic is ex­pected to ac­cel­er­ate amid weaker de­mand.</p>
    <p>Of all the re­gions stud­ied in C&W’s re­port, Greater China will see the small­est im­pact to its struc­tural of­fice de­mand. The work­from-home trend will lower net of­fice de­mand by only 2.9 per cent, the firm said, adding that net of­fice de­mand for the re­gion is set to grow by about 536 mil­lion sq ft from 2022 to 2030.</p>
