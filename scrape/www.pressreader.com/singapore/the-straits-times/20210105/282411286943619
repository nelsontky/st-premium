    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • For most play­ers in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA), to av­er­age 26.4 points from the first five games of the sea­son would be a more than re­spectable tally.</p>
    <p>But not Stephen Curry.</p>
    <p>The three-time NBA cham­pion is held to higher stan­dards and, be­fore Sun­day’s game with the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers, had been sub­jected to plenty of crit­i­cism on so­cial me­dia af­ter his side’s 2-3 start.</p>
    <p>Com­ing off an in­jury-plagued year which lim­ited him to just five games due to a bro­ken hand, many had ques­tioned whether Curry still had what it takes to carry a team.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fin­ish­ing as the worst team in the NBA last sea­son, the War­riors are still in tran­si­tion and have not been tipped to make the play­offs, with the loss of Klay Thompson to in­jury com­pound­ing mat­ters.</p>
    <p>But two-time Most Valu­able Player Curry got his swag­ger back on Sun­day, scor­ing a ca­reer-high 62 points as the War­riors out­gunned the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers 137-122.</p>
    <p>It was just like old times for the All-Star guard, ar­guably the great­est shooter in NBA his­tory, and he was quick to re­mind his crit­ics not to write him off just yet.</p>
    <p>On his haters, Curry, who nailed eight three-point­ers to top his pre­vi­ous high of 54, said: “Cue the Jor­dan meme, right?</p>
    <p>“I take all that per­son­ally. Just an op­por­tu­nity to kind of as­sert my will on the game early and try to cre­ate some en­ergy.</p>
    <p>“We have a win­ning spirit, we’ve just gotta fig­ure out how to do it con­sis­tently, and against the good teams in the league, it’s gonna test us. If you’re around this league long enough, you kind of get to see ev­ery sce­nario and sit­u­a­tion. We have a lot to fight for and a huge chal­lenge in front of us.</p>
    <p>“(The Blaz­ers) are the es­tab­lished team now, a guy like (Damian) Lil­lard, like I said, just brings the best out of you.</p>
    <p>“And I love the com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>The 50-plus point night was the NBA’s first of the sea­son, while the 60-pointer was the first for Golden State since Thompson had 60 in 2016.</p>
    <p>The last War­rior to record more than 62 points in a game was Rick Barry with 64 in 1974 and Curry is the first to score at least 30 points in each half of a game since the late Kobe Bryant for the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers in 2005.</p>
    <p>This was also the 32-year-old’s sev­enth 50-point game, break­ing a tie with Kevin Du­rant for the fourth most among ac­tive play­ers and he is the sec­ond-old­est to score 60 since Bryant did it aged 37.</p>
    <p>His per­for­mance left many in awe, with Lil­lard, who paced Port­land with 32 points, tweet­ing: “You can’t dish it out and not be able take it”.</p>
    <p>In­di­ana Pac­ers cen­tre Myles Turner also tweeted he “bet­ter not see any more Steph slan­der on my time­line”.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Paul Ge­orge scored 39 points and the vis­it­ing Los An­ge­les Clip­pers cooled the Phoenix Suns, snap­ping their four-game win­ning streak with a 112-107 vic­tory on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The hosts had en­tered the day tied for the best record in the NBA at 5-1 but the Clip­pers matched their start with the road win.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors, who along with the Suns and cham­pi­ons Los An­ge­les Lak­ers, are in a three-way tie atop the West stand­ings de­spite re­veal­ing that sev­eral of their staff had been placed in quar­an­tine un­der league Covid-19 pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ESPN, a staff tested pos­i­tive fol­low­ing a New Year’s Eve group meal, with the rest asked to self-iso­late.</p>
