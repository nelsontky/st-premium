    <p>Dr Adrian Tan and Dr Lim Shu Fen are both trained in f a mi l y medicine, but it did not pre­pare the cou­ple for the chal­lenges of par­ent­hood.</p>
    <p>Their son, Lu­cas, now 18 months old, had pro­longed neona­tal jaun­dice, a com­mon con­di­tion where a new­born has yel­low­ish skin and eyes be­cause of too much biliru­bin, a yel­low pig­ment in red blood cells.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing their fre­quent trips to the poly­clinic, the cou­ple, both 35, re­alised the lo­gis­tics of go­ing out with a new baby was com­pli­cated and time-con­sum­ing. Their son had to be breast­fed and have his di­a­per changed, and the bur­den fell mainly on the mother, who was re­cov­er­ing from labour.</p>
    <p>Why not get the baby’s jaun­dice checked at home in­stead, Dr Tan thought.</p>
    <p>That sparked the idea for Babysteps Med­i­cal, a house-call med­i­cal ser­vice which started in Jan­uary. It spe­cialises in jaun­dice checks, vac­ci­na­tions and pri­mary care for ba­bies and chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“The con­cept of Babysteps Med­i­cal is to make moth­er­hood eas­ier be­cause it is al­ready tough be­ing a mum as it is,” says Dr Tan, who pre­vi­ously worked in a poly­clinic as part of his res­i­dency course. His wife is still with a poly­clinic.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan sees some 30 pa­tients a week, charg­ing about $90 for a jaun­dice check and about $150 for acute con­di­tions such as fever.</p>
    <p>He says vis­it­ing pa­tients at home al­lows him to in­ter­act with them in an en­vi­ron­ment they are com­fort­able with, ob­serve their liv­ing con­di­tions and fam­ily struc­ture, and get to know the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>He hopes that by treat­ing chil­dren at home, “they will be more at ease and they won’t have a fear of the doc­tor in fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>He adds: “I try to give that per­sonal touch to my pa­tients. I feel it’s nice to build a re­la­tion­ship with my pa­tients so I know what they’re go­ing through. I think the feed­back so far has been good be­cause they feel that the ser­vice has been convenient.”</p>
    <p>The per­sonal touch proved crit­i­cal in one case in­volv­ing a new mother. While check­ing on the five-day-old baby’s jaun­dice, Dr Tan no­ticed that the mother seemed to be feel­ing low. Af­ter speak­ing to her hus­band, Dr Tan rec­om­mended that she see a psy­chi­a­trist im­me­di­ately for post­na­tal blues or post­na­tal de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>“The hus­band was quite grate­ful,” he says. “It moved me a bit that I was able to help them be­fore any­thing more se­ri­ous hap­pened.”</p>
