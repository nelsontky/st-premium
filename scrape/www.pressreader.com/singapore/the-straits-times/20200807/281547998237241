    <p>The world’s sec­ond-largest rough di­a­mond has found its way to Sin­ga­pore. Roughly the size of a ten­nis ball, the 1,758-carat di­a­mond was pur­chased by Louis Vuit­ton and is on show­case here un­til next Tues­day to in­ter­ested buy­ers. Named Sewelo, the glint­ing black stone is sec­ond only to the Cul­li­nan – a 3,106-carat gem mined in South Africa in 1905.</p>
    <p>The world’s sec­ond largest rough di­a­mond has found its way to Sin­ga­pore’s shores.</p>
    <p>Roughly the size of a ten­nis ball, the 1,758-carat di­a­mond that was pur­chased by Louis Vuit­ton and un­veiled in Jan­uary is be­ing show­cased to in­ter­ested buy­ers un­til Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Named Sewelo, which means “rare find” in the Setswana lan­guage, it was dis­cov­ered in April last year at a mine in Botswana owned by Cana­dian di­a­mond min­ing com­pany Lu­cara Di­a­mond Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The glint­ing black stone is the sec­ond largest rough gem di­a­mond in recorded his­tory, sec­ond only to the Cul­li­nan – a 3,106-carat gem mined in South Africa in 1905.</p>
    <p>That makes the Sewelo, es­ti­mated to be two bil­lion years old, the largest di­a­mond dis­cov­ered in this cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Louis Vuit­ton’s pur­chase of this his­toric find has been dubbed by many as a bold move for the lux­ury house, which is bet­ter known for its hand­bags and her­itage trunks.</p>
    <p>The LVMH-owned brand en­tered high jew­ellery only in 2012, with an ate­lier in the es­teemed Place Ven­dome in Paris.</p>
    <p>It is not known ex­actly how many mil­lions the French fash­ion house paid for the stone.</p>
    <p>Asked why the Sewelo would be the stone to pro­pel Vuit­ton’s high jew­ellery ef­forts, chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Louis Vuit­ton Michael Burke said in an e-mail in­ter­view: “This rough stone is unique. Un­veil­ing it to a hand­ful of clients is a tes­ta­ment to our dar­ing spirit and our de­sire to be a ma­jor player in jew­ellery.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We’re po­si­tion­ing our­selves for the next 100 years.”</p>
    <p>Avail­able for view­ing by ap­point­ment only, its stop in Sin­ga­pore at the Louis Vuit­ton Is­land Mai­son at The Shoppes at Ma­rina Bay Sands is its only one in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>In­side the store, the Sewelo takes cen­tre stage, mounted on a minia­ture trunk in a dark ex­hibit. No bar­ri­cades have been set up around it, al­low­ing clients to get up close and per­sonal with the stone.</p>
    <p>Show­cas­ing the di­a­mond in its rawest form – its thin black car­bon coating un­touched – was sig­nif­i­cant, said Mr Burke.</p>
    <p>“The idea is not to by­pass the tra­di­tional net­work (of jew­ellery), but to make the chain more trans­par­ent by show­ing Sewelo’s ori­gin.”</p>
    <p>While the house de­clined to com­ment on its ex­act plans for the rare stone, it is ex­pected to be cus­tom-cut into di­a­monds and turned into be­spoke pieces once Vuit­ton finds a buyer.</p>
    <p>Unique to the brand is its abil­ity to cut di­a­monds in the signet of Louis Vuit­ton’s iconic Mono­gram – the LV Flower Cut, a rounded flower; and the LV Star Cut, a star­shaped mo­tif.</p>
    <p>Louis Vuit­ton is cur­rently work­ing closely with An­twerp-based di­a­mond cut­ters HB Com­pany to study and plan the op­ti­mal yield of the stone – which is es­ti­mated to vary from one oval di­a­mond of 900 carats to one di­a­mond of 300 carats, with mul­ti­ple satel­lites of three to five carats.</p>
    <p>The pos­si­bil­i­ties are end­less. The Cul­li­nan pro­duced stones of var­i­ous cuts and sizes, with the two largest cur­rently mounted in the Crown Jew­els of the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>The Sewelo show­case re­it­er­ates Louis Vuit­ton’s am­bi­tion to be a player in the high jew­ellery field, com­pet­ing with the likes of Cartier.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try pun­dits also be­lieve this is an­other move by par­ent com­pany LVMH – which al­ready owns Bvl­gari and paid US$16.2 bil­lion (S$22.2 bil­lion) to ac­quire Tiffany’s last Novem­ber – to stake a big claim in the high jew­ellery sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Burke said: “We are trunk mak­ers, not jew­ellers. Even if we re­cruited new tal­ent and put all our ef­forts into this new field, we wouldn’t want to pro­ceed as the oth­ers – it would make no sense.</p>
    <p>“We have to be au­da­cious and brave; this stone is the proof of this. No jeweller on Place Ven­dome would ever dare to take the same risk.”</p>
