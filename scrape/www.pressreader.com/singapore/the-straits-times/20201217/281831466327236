    <p>A vi­o­lent protest over un­paid wages at an iPhone assem­bly plant near Ban­ga­lore could com­pli­cate In­dia’s plans to woo for­eign phone mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, thou­sands of work­ers at the Naras­a­pura fac­tory of Wistron In­fo­comm, a Tai­wanese iPhone sup­plier, gath­ered to de­mand that they be paid their de­layed wages and over­time pay.</p>
    <p>Some of the pro­test­ers turned vi­o­lent, smash­ing glass win­dows and of­fice equip­ment with rods and stones and set­ting fire to ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The com­pany ini­tially es­ti­mated dam­ages to be worth US$60 mil­lion (S$80 mil­lion), but later re­vised the fig­ure to US$7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In a com­plaint to the po­lice, Wistron said more than 5,000 con­tract em­ploy­ees and 2,000 un­known peo­ple were re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they ar­rested more than 150 peo­ple for of­fences in­clud­ing ri­ot­ing, un­law­ful assem­bly and crim­i­nal in­tim­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The Wistron plant be­gan op­er­a­tions in Septem­ber. A lo­cal labour of­fi­cial said it em­ploys 1,343 per­ma­nent work­ers di­rectly and 8,490 through con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the All-In­dia Cen­tral Coun­cil of Trade Unions have vis­ited Naras­a­pura to meet work­ers. It said the em­ploy­ees al­leged they were il­le­gally com­pelled to work 12-hour shifts, and that many con­tract work­ers were not paid on time and re­ceived less money than promised.</p>
    <p>The fed­er­a­tion said the sit­u­a­tion was akin to “an ex­tremely ex­ploita­tive sweat­shop”.</p>
    <p>Labour of­fi­cials said they did not re­ceive any com­plaints from any em­ployee as­so­ci­a­tion at the fac­tory, which does not have a for­mal work­ers’ union.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times con­tacted some Wistron em­ploy­ees but they de­clined to speak, fear­ing ar­rest.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s re­spon­si­bil­ity stan­dards re­quire sup­pli­ers to en­sure that third-party em­ploy­ment agen­cies pay work­ers and pro­vide le­gal ben­e­fits ac­cu­rately and on time.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has launched an investigat­ion into whether its poli­cies were breached at the fac­tory.</p>
    <p>Wistron said in a state­ment to the Taipei Ex­change that it “al­ways abides by the law, and fully sup­ports and is co­op­er­at­ing with rel­e­vant author­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>“The ac­ci­dent was caused by un­known per­sons burst­ing in and caus­ing dam­age to the plant with un­clear in­ten­tions,” it added.</p>
    <p>Deputy Chief Min­is­ter of Kar­nataka C. N. Ash­wath Narayan told re­porters that those who took the law into their own hands would be dealt with “very strongly”. He added that the con­cerns of both the em­ployer and em­ploy­ees would be “ef­fec­tively ad­dressed”.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple be­gan mak­ing iPhones in In­dia in 2017. The Naras­a­pura plant, one of two Wistron fac­to­ries in the south­ern state of Kar­nataka, as­sem­bles iPhone SE 2020 hand­sets, and is ex­pected to pro­duce five mil­lion to 10 mil­lion a year. Fox­conn, an­other Tai­wan firm, has been mak­ing iPhone 11 hand­sets at a plant near Chennai since July.</p>
    <p>As part of a Make in In­dia drive, Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi has courted for­eign in­vestors, in­clud­ing global brands look­ing to re­duce their de­pen­dence on China.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Par­lia­ment passed three labour laws that have made it eas­ier for com­pa­nies of a cer­tain size to fire work­ers.</p>
    <p>It re­stricts work­ers’ rights to form unions and strike.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, the gov­ern­ment said it was ap­prov­ing in­cen­tives to com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Wistron, Fox­conn and an­other Ap­ple sup­plier, Pe­ga­tron, to en­tice them to set up elec­tron­ics man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported that the three com­pa­nies plan to in­vest US$900 mil­lion in the next five years.</p>
    <p>More than 3,500 em­ploy­ees of Toy­ota’s car man­u­fac­tur­ing unit in Bi­dadi, near Ban­ga­lore, have been on strike since Nov 10, over an “un­sci­en­tific in­crease in work­load” im­posed that month to speed up pro­duc­tion. The com­pany has since been put un­der a lock­down.</p>
