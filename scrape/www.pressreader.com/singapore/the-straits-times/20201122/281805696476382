    <p>A con­tro­ver­sial RM43 bil­lion (S$14.1 bil­lion) port pro­ject off the coast of Me­laka that was touted as the largest in the re­gion when ready – over­tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s – has been scrapped by the state govern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Me­laka govern­ment said in a let­ter dated last Mon­day that the de­vel­oper of the Me­laka Gate­way pro­ject had failed to com­plete the recla­ma­tion works af­ter three years as con­tracted.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­oper is call­ing the ter­mi­na­tion un­fair and mulling over le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“We want to set­tle this am­i­ca­bly. But if not, we are ready” for le­gal ac­tion, Me­laka Gate­way’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Michelle Ong told The Sun­day Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She said no rea­son was given for the “sud­den ter­mi­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>The pro­ject was ini­tially a ven­ture be­tween lit­tle-known Malaysian com­pany KAJ Devel­op­ment – of which Datuk Ong is CEO – and China’s Pow­erChina In­ter­na­tional. It in­volved the recla­ma­tion of three is­lands off Me­laka, two of which would be man-made.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese part­ner has since left the ven­ture.</p>
    <p>Apart from the gi­ant deep-sea port, Me­laka Gate­way was to in­clude an in­ter­na­tional cruise terminal, bun­ga­lows with a pri­vate ma­rina, con­do­mini­ums, ho­tels and theme parks.</p>
    <p>The state govern­ment ter­mi­nated the sea recla­ma­tion agree­ment with KAJ Devel­op­ment, say­ing it had failed to com­plete the 246ha devel­op­ment – about half the size of Sen­tosa is­land – three years af­ter sign­ing a deal on Oct 4, 2017.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter seen by The Sun­day Times, the Chief Min­is­ter’s Of­fice said: “The com­pany is also re­quired to re­turn the pro­ject site, ef­fec­tive upon the ter­mi­na­tion no­tice is­sued by the Me­laka state govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, all mat­ters aris­ing re­gard­ing the Me­laka Gate­way pro­ject site should be di­rectly com­mu­ni­cated with the Me­laka state govern­ment.”</p>
    <p>Me­laka Gate­way was planned with the am­bi­tion of over­tak­ing Sin­ga­pore as the largest port in the re­gion. The pro­ject was first an­nounced in 2014 by then premier Na­jib Razak af­ter a visit to Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Na­jib was ousted in the 2018 gen­eral elec­tion, the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) govern­ment dropped or rene­go­ti­ated sev­eral Chi­nese-backed mega in­fra­struc­ture projects, in­clud­ing the East Coast Rail Line con­nect­ing Port Klang in Se­lan­gor to Kuan­tan on Malaysia’s east coast.</p>
    <p>The Me­laka Gate­way pro­ject was among those scrapped, but the PH govern­ment later al­lowed it to con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Two of Malaysia’s largest ports are along the Malacca Strait, but Me­laka Gate­way was seen as part of a wider port al­liance be­tween Kuala Lumpur and Bei­jing, to in­crease bi­lat­eral trade and boost ship­ping and lo­gis­tics along China’s much-vaunted Mar­itime Silk Road.</p>
    <p>Port Klang, Malaysia’s largest, is north of Me­laka; and the Port of Tan­jung Pelepas, Malaysia’s se­cond largest, is in Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>Ms Ong said the com­pany has re­quested to meet the Me­laka govern­ment, but to no avail.</p>
    <p>She said RM700 mil­lion has been spent on the pro­ject so far.</p>
    <p>“We have man­aged to bring in tens of bil­lions in FDI,” she said, re­fer­ring to for­eign di­rect in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>“We have var­i­ous in­vestors,” she said at a news con­fer­ence in Kuala Lumpur yes­ter­day, adding that agree­ments signed for one of the three is­lands brought in US$3 bil­lion (S$1.34 bil­lion) a year, and in­vest­ments ob­tained for the deep sea port to­talled RM3.8 bil­lion, while the cruise jetty had brought in in­vest­ments of RM1.4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>On­go­ing con­struc­tion at the pro­ject site was halted in March ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic, but work had re­sumed two weeks ago, Ms Ong told The Sun­day Times.</p>
