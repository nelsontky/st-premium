    <p>Home seek­ers made a bee­line for the four-room Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats in Gey­lang. As of 5pm yes­ter­day, there were more than 14 ap­pli­cants vy­ing for each of the 334 four-room flats in Dakota One. The ap­pli­ca­tion rate beats the pre­vi­ous high of about 13 ap­pli­cants for each of the 235 four-room flats in Ang Mo Kio in last Novem­ber’s BTO launch.</p>
    <p>Home seek­ers made a bee­line for the four-room Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats in Gey­lang, which saw one of the high­est ap­pli­ca­tion rates in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>As of 5pm yes­ter­day, there were more than 14 first-time ap­pli­cants vy­ing for each of the 334 four-room flats at the Dakota One project. Four-room flats are the largest type in the project, which is within walk­ing dis­tance of Dakota MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion rate beats the pre­vi­ous high of around 13 ap­pli­cants for each of the 235 four-room flats in a BTO launch in Ang Mo Kio last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>In this month’s sales ex­er­cise, which con­cluded yes­ter­day, the 87 three-room flats in Gey­lang were less pop­u­lar, at­tract­ing around five ap­pli­cants for each unit.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion was also stiff this month in the ma­ture es­tate of Ang Mo Kio, where the 140 five-room flats at the Ke­bun Baru Edge project at­tracted al­most 12 first­time ap­pli­cants for each flat.</p>
    <p>The five-room flats in Ang Mo Kio are the most ex­pen­sive flats in this ex­er­cise, with prices rang­ing from $571,000 to $725,000.</p>
    <p>The project’s 240 four-room flats were also hotly con­tested, at­tract­ing over eight ap­pli­cants each.</p>
    <p>ERA Re­alty re­search and con­sul­tancy head Nicholas Mak said its prox­im­ity to the up­com­ing Mayflower MRT sta­tion and to schools such as Ai Tong School and CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (Pri­mary) is its key at­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The flats at the Bis­han Tow­ers project in Bis­han were less pop­u­lar in this round, with four ap­pli­cants for each of the 272 four-room flats and fewer than two ap­pli­cants for each of the 80 three-room flats.</p>
    <p>In Wood­lands, the 438 five-room flats in Ur­banVille @ Wood­lands were the most in demand, draw­ing more than six first-time ap­pli­cants for each flat.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the 184 five-room flats in Parc Res­i­dences @ Ten­gah had around five first-time ap­pli­cants each – the high­est ap­pli­ca­tion rate since the first flats in the up­com­ing “for­est town” were launched in 2018.</p>
    <p>The project’s 480 two-room flexi flats drew al­most two el­derly ap­pli­cants for each unit. The project will be in­te­grated with a poly­clinic.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie, said: “The poly­clinic could have been a big de­cid­ing fac­tor for the older folk who want to live closer to their chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, the Hous­ing Board launched 7,862 BTO flats for sale in eight es­tates. It had said some of the flats in this launch may take up to five years to build due to Covid-19 safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber, the HDB will of­fer about 5,700 flats in Bis­han, Sem­bawang, Tampines, Ten­gah and Toa Payoh. An­other 3,550 flats in Bukit Ba­tok, Ten­gah, Kal­lang/ Wham­poa and Toa Payoh will be launched in Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion was also stiff this month in the ma­ture es­tate of Ang Mo Kio, where the 140 five-room flats at the Ke­bun Baru Edge project at­tracted 2,782 ap­pli­cants, or al­most 12 for each flat. ERA Re­alty re­search and con­sul­tancy head Nicholas Mak said its prox­im­ity to the up­com­ing Mayflower MRT sta­tion and to schools such as Ai Tong School and CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (Pri­mary) is its key at­trac­tion.</p>
