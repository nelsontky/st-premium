    <p>Peo­ple may have be­come used to food take­aways since the twom­onth cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when din­ing in at eater­ies was not al­lowed, to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But a lo­cal char­ity hopes res­i­dents can help to re­duce the use of dis­pos­ables by us­ing their own con­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>A new Bring Your Own Con­tainer (BYOC) cam­paign was launched by Zero Waste SG yes­ter­day at Tiong Bahru Mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Un­der the ini­tia­tive, din­ers at five eat­ing places will be re­minded by zero-waste am­bas­sadors dur­ing week­ends to bring their own con­tain­ers or refuse un­nec­es­sary dis­pos­ables.</p>
    <p>Din­ers who show an am­bas­sador that they have brought their own take­away con­tain­ers can par­tic­i­pate in a lucky draw and stand to win prizes such as a UnionPay pre­paid CashCard.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Tiong Bahru Mar­ket, other places in­volved in the cam­paign in­clude the food cen­tres at Block 448 Cle­menti Av­enue 3, Block 84 Ma­rine Pa­rade Cen­tral and Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty, and the Ko­pi­tiam at Our Tampines Hub.</p>
    <p>Dr Amy Khor, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, was guest of hon­our at the launch of the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>She said there has been an ob­serv­able shift in con­sump­tion pat­terns due to the pan­demic, with more peo­ple pur­chas­ing take­away meals and opt­ing for on­line shop­ping. “This shift has gen­er­ated more waste in dis­pos­ables. The Bring Your Own Con­tainer cam­paign is thus timely,” she said.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the zero-waste cam­paign fo­cused more on re­duc­ing the use of dis­pos­ables on other fronts, such as get­ting shop­pers to bring their own bags when gro­cery shop­ping, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that all dis­pos­ables, whether made of pa­per, plas­tic or degrad­able ma­te­ri­als, leave a car­bon foot­print in their pro­duc­tion, trans­port and dis­posal pro­cesses, Dr Khor said bring­ing con­tain­ers for take­aways is some­thing in­di­vid­u­als can do for the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“By mak­ing small changes in our daily lives, we can help to build a greener and more sus­tain­able Sin­ga­pore for our fu­ture gen­er­a­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>An ear­lier sur­vey by alumni from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Mas­ter of Sci­ence (En­vi­ron­men­tal Man­age­ment) pro­gramme had found that an ex­tra 1,334 tonnes of pack­ag­ing – equiv­a­lent to the weight of 92 dou­bledecker buses – was gen­er­ated from take­away and de­liv­ery meals dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Ms Pek Hai Lin, Zero Waste SG ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, said con­sumers can also save on charges im­posed by some hawk­ers for dis­pos­able con­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>“Hawk­ers also save money from pack­ag­ing costs, and we ben­e­fit from saved re­sources, and clean­ers will not be over­worked,” she said.</p>
    <p>“This is all the more im­por­tant as many of us con­tinue to work from home and have to prac­tise social dis­tanc­ing.”</p>
    <p>A diner, Mr El­gin Teng, 43, said the ini­tia­tive was a good ef­fort.</p>
    <p>The en­gi­neer noted, how­ever, that it is con­ve­nient to bring his own con­tainer if he is com­ing from home, but less so if he is out and about. “Find­ing a place to wash the uten­sils and con­tain­ers will also be chal­leng­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Joseph Tan, 46, who brought his own con­tainer to take away food from Tiong Bahru Mar­ket, said his fam­ily has been prac­tis­ing this habit for a while now.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to his tingkat, the house hus­band said it helps to keep food warm and is easy to wash. “But hawk­ers need to come on board too,” he said, adding that cer­tain dishes are more chal­leng­ing to take away due to their por­tion sizes.</p>
