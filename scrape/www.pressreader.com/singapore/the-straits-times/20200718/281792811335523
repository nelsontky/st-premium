    <p>• Brazil on Thurs­day passed the two mil­lion mark for con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases, with lit­tle sign that the rate of in­crease is slow­ing as anger grows over Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro’s han­dling of the out­break.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures pub­lished by the Health Min­istry showed there were more than 45,000 new cases on Thurs­day, and an ex­tra 1,300 deaths.</p>
    <p>It was only 27 days ago when Brazil – which is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the world’s sec­ond-largest out­break af­ter the United States – reached one mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>Over the last two months, Brazil has recorded more than 30,000 new cases over a pe­riod of 24 hours 26 times, and on 11 of those oc­ca­sions, there were more than 40,000 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, con­firmed cases in</p>
    <p>Brazil to­talled 2,015,382, while deaths num­bered 76,846.</p>
    <p>A patch­work of state and city re­sponses has held up poorly in Brazil in the ab­sence of a tightly co­or­di­nated pol­icy from the fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>De­spite the rapid spread of the virus, Mr Bol­sonaro has pres­sured lo­cal gov­ern­ments to lift lock­down re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Bol­sonaro, who tested pos­i­tive for the virus last week, has played down its health risks and fought against so­cial dis­tanc­ing or­ders, call­ing their eco­nomic ef­fects worse than the dis­ease it­self.</p>
    <p>Un­der pres­sure, many gov­er­nors and may­ors have loos­ened re­stric­tions in re­cent weeks, fu­elling big­ger out­breaks.</p>
    <p>In big cities such as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, where the out­break first emerged in Brazil, new daily cases have sta­bilised and even be­gun to de­cline.</p>
    <p>But in Rio Grande do Sul and Parana in south­ern Brazil, which had kept a lid on their out­breaks early on, cases are ris­ing faster than in the rest of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment didn’t budge de­spite the health cri­sis. They thought more about money than about peo­ple,” said Rio de Janeiro res­i­dent Rafael Reis, who lost his 71-year-old mother to the dis­ease. “They wanted ev­ery­one back on the streets.”</p>
    <p>Public health ex­perts are rais­ing alarm about the wors­en­ing out­look in south­ern Brazil, which has the cold­est weather dur­ing the south­ern hemi­sphere win­ter and a pop­u­la­tion that skews older than the rest of the coun­try.</p>
