    <p>HARBIN • For more than 300 “ice min­ers” in Harbin, work be­gins in the numb­ing cold be­fore dawn ev­ery day on the frozen Songhua, a broad river that winds its way through the north-east­ern Chi­nese city.</p>
    <p>Wield­ing long ice picks, the work­ers break up the frozen sur­face of the kilo­me­tre-wide river into crate-size blocks of ice.</p>
    <p>Many of them con­struc­tion labour­ers or farm­ers, they wear knee-high rub­ber boots, down jack­ets, thick gloves and hats with flaps to pro­tect their ears from the frigid air.</p>
    <p>“We come to mine ice at 6am ev­ery day,” said Mr Zhang Wei, 40. “We need to work over­time some­times, un­til 8pm or 9pm, even late af­ter mid­night.”</p>
    <p>Lunch is brief – a bowl of pip­ing hot noo­dles, dumplings or steamed buns. Makeshift can­teens of­fer a lit­tle warmth.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery day since early this month, tens of thou­sands of ice blocks have been prised out of the river and moved by truck to the venue of Harbin’s an­nual win­ter fes­ti­val, where they are used to build life-size castles, pago­das, bridges and even a func­tion­ing hot­pot restau­rant.</p>
    <p>Ice from the river is es­sen­tial. “Ar­ti­fi­cial ice isn’t that thick, and isn’t strong enough to stand in the wind,” said Mr Wang Qiusheng, who has been carv­ing ice for the fes­ti­val for 20 years.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers are racing to com­plete the sculp­tures at the fes­ti­val venue – a busy scene of fork­lifts, cranes and scaf­fold­ing.</p>
    <p>The ice blocks are painstak­ingly laid on top of one an­other while work­ers shape, trim and cut them to size with chain­saws, pickle forks and tooth chis­els.</p>
    <p>The 37th Harbin In­ter­na­tional Ice and Snow Sculp­ture Fes­ti­val is due to be­gin on Jan 5, and will fea­ture ski­ing, sled­ding, mass wed­dings, win­ter swim­ming and a theme park of i ce sculp­tures bathed in coloured lights.</p>
    <p>With China’s in­ter­na­tional bor­ders heav­ily re­stricted due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, do­mes­tic tourists are ex­pected to ac­count for the bulk of vis­i­tors marvel­ling at the ice sculp­tures next month in tem­per­a­tures be­low mi­nus 35 deg C.</p>
