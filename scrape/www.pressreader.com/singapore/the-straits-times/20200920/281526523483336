    <p>The raised min­i­mum salaries for hir­ing for­eign­ers on work passes have caused sleep­less nights for some for­eign grad­u­ates of Sin­ga­pore uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>Those who had re­ceived sub­si­dies from the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) un­der the Tu­ition Grant Scheme (TGS) are ob­li­gated to work in a Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered com­pany for three years upon grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But in this tough cli­mate, where even lo­cal grad­u­ates are strug­gling to find jobs, th­ese for­eign grad­u­ates have it worse as com­pa­nies are urged to main­tain a work­force with a Sin­ga­pore core.</p>
    <p>Some worry about hav­ing to pay back their bonds of up to $100,000 if they re­main job­less af­ter a year, and stay­ing in Sin­ga­pore while un­em­ployed cre­ates fur­ther fi­nan­cial pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Un­like gov­ern­ment schol­ar­ships, the TGS does not guar­an­tee its re­cip­i­ents a job in the civil ser­vice.</p>
    <p>DIF­FI­CUL­TIES FIND­ING A JOB</p>
    <p>Six of the 10 in­ter­na­tional stu­dents The Sun­day Times spoke to have not been able to land a job in the past four months.</p>
    <p>An en­vi­ron­men­tal stud­ies grad­u­ate from In­dia, who wanted to be known only by her ini­tials N.G., has sent out more than 60 job ap­pli­ca­tions since June this year, but was short­listed for just two in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old, who grad­u­ated from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) in May, said a mar­ket­ing com­pany told her it wanted to hire her but could not af­ford to pay her the cur­rent Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salary of $4,500.</p>
    <p>“I told the com­pany I might be able to get an EP on a lower salary, be­cause ex­cep­tions have been made for TGS stu­dents be­fore.”</p>
    <p>But the com­pany did not get back to her on ex­plor­ing this op­tion, she added.</p>
    <p>N.G. said she does not even get the chance to ex­plain her sit­u­a­tion to other prospec­tive em­ploy­ers, and thinks she is be­ing re­jected “off the bat” for be­ing a for­eigner.</p>
    <p>The base­line salary for newly hired EP hold­ers was raised from Sept 1 from $3,900 to $4,500, while the qual­i­fy­ing salary for new S Pass hold­ers will be i ncreased from $2,400 to $2,500 from Oct 1.</p>
    <p>This is to sup­port em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans as the Covid-19 cri­sis weighs on the job mar­ket, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>N.G. is cur­rently stay­ing in Sin­ga­pore on a short-term visit pass which ex­pires at the end of this month. She ap­plied for a long-term visit pass 12 weeks ago, which would grant her up to a two-year stay, but it has not been ap­proved yet.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing back to my home coun­try will make job hunt­ing (here) even more dif­fi­cult, as em­ploy­ers (here) tra­di­tion­ally re­sist hir­ing em­ploy­ees not based in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>N.G.’s ex­pe­ri­ence is not un­com­mon. An NUS science grad­u­ate, who iden­ti­fied her­self as Ms Xi, said she has sub­mit­ted up to 100 ap­pli­ca­tions for a job in re­search.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old Aus­tralian re­ceived just one of­fer in April, only to have it re­tracted two weeks later be­cause of a new “no more EPs” blan</p>
    <p>ket rule the com­pany rolled out.</p>
    <p>She is now in­tern­ing at a think­tank, where she hopes she will even­tu­ally be hired full time.</p>
    <p>She said the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme in June – open only to Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent residents – has made it more dif­fi­cult for her to find em­ploy­ment af­ter she grad­u­ated in May.</p>
    <p>“Many en­try-level jobs I was in­ter­ested in have been re­placed by trainee­ships. More­over, the Gov­ern­ment funds 80 per cent of a lo­cal trainee’s monthly al­lowance, which gives em­ploy­ers no rea­son to hire a for­eigner,” she added.</p>
    <p>Even those for­eign grad­u­ates who found jobs told ST the process had not been easy.</p>
    <p>A Viet­namese ar­chi­tec­ture grad­u­ate, who wanted to be known only as Ms Minh and de­clined to re­veal her univer­sity, said it took her four months to find a job and an­other three months to get her EP ap­proved, af­ter the ap­pli­ca­tion was ini­tially turned down.</p>
    <p>“MOM did not say why my ap­pli­ca­tion was re­jected, but my com­pany sub­mit­ted an ap­peal for me. I was pray­ing very hard that they would not just give up and hire a Sin­ga­porean in­stead,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mr John Wid­jaja, a 25-year-old In­done­sian in­for­ma­tion sys­tems grad­u­ate from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU), took five months to se­cure a job in June.</p>
    <p>He said a let­ter in­form­ing em­ploy­ers that TGS re­cip­i­ents’ EP ap­pli­ca­tions will be “con­sid­ered favourably” helped him get a job as a soft­ware qual­ity as­sur­ance en­gi­neer, even though his pay was be­low the EP salary thresh­old of $3,900 at the time.</p>
    <p>The let­ter is is­sued by the univer­sity, with the sup­port of MOM, for TGS re­cip­i­ents to at­tach with their EP ap­pli­ca­tions to ex­pe­dite the ap­proval process. It is valid for 12 months from the date of their grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“But it does not guar­an­tee that TGS hold­ers will qual­ify for an EP and em­ploy­ers still have to ad­ver­tise job va­can­cies on the na­tional</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>jobs bank and con­sider lo­cal ap­pli­cants first,” Mr Wid­jaja said.</p>
    <p>Go­ing back to my home coun­try will make job hunt­ing (here) even more dif­fi­cult, as em­ploy­ers (here) tra­di­tion­ally re­sist hir­ing em­ploy­ees not based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL STRESS</p>
    <p>With­out a source of in­come, many of th­ese in­ter­na­tional grad­u­ates are feel­ing the fi­nan­cial strain.</p>
    <p>Ms Xi is dig­ging into sav­ings to make ends meet as her in­tern­ship pay “barely cov­ers the rent”.</p>
    <p>She tries to limit her monthly ex­pen­di­ture to $400 by eat­ing out less.</p>
    <p>Ms Germaine Lim, a 24-year-old Malaysian, has sent out around 40 job ap­pli­ca­tions since May.</p>
    <p>She said that while no MOE of­fi­cial has pres­sured her about em­ploy­ment, she is wor­ried about hav­ing to pay dam­ages if she does not have a full-time job by next year.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal science grad­u­ate from NUS said: “The TGS covered about $92,000 in school fees for my four years in NUS. If I add in in­ter­est, it means I owe them more than $100,000 if I vi­o­late the terms of the bond.”</p>

    <p>MR JOHN WID­JAJA, an In­done­sian in­for­ma­tion sys­tems grad­u­ate, who took five months to get a job. He was helped by a let­ter in­form­ing em­ploy­ers that TGS re­cip­i­ents’ EP ap­pli­ca­tions will be “con­sid­ered favourably”. The let­ter was is­sued by Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity with the sup­port of the Min­istry of Man­power.</p>
    <p>ANTI-FOR­EIGNER SEN­TI­MENTS</p>
    <p>Most of those in­ter­viewed de­clined to give their full name for fear of stok­ing anti-for­eigner feel­ings or hurt­ing their em­ploy­ment prospects.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said she un­der­stands the re­sent­ment some Sin­ga­pore­ans have against for­eign­ers as liveli­hoods are at stake and the pan­demic has made com­pe­ti­tion for jobs fiercer than ever.</p>
    <p>“Some Sin­ga­pore­ans may think that for­eign­ers have it easy, but peo­ple like me are ac­tu­ally strug­gling a lot. Rais­ing the EP thresh­old to $4,500 is sup­posed to tar­get the older, more ex­pe­ri­enced EP hold­ers, but fresh grad­u­ates like my­self still get hurt by it,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Minh has heard some of her Sin­ga­porean friends com­plain that their pay is too low and blame for­eign­ers when they do not get their first choice of job.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is for­eign­ers don’t have the choice to be picky. I would lit­er­ally have taken any­thing, as long as I could get started on my ca­reer,” she said.</p>
