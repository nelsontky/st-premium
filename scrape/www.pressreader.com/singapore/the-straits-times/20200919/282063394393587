    <p>A dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal (DT) has de­ter­mined that ac­tivist lawyer M. Ravi should be or­dered to pay a penalty of at least $10,000 for un­sup­ported at­tacks against state pros­e­cu­tors and a se­nior district judge.</p>
    <p>The at­tacks were con­tained in a me­dia state­ment pub­lished by Mr Ravi, 51, and posted on­line in July last year.</p>
    <p>The DT, ap­pointed by Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon last Novem­ber and com­pris­ing Se­nior Coun­sel Lee Kim Shin and se­nior lawyer Har­ish Kumar, found that Mr Ravi “in­tended to cast as­per­sions of bias against state pros­e­cu­tors, and against Mr (Bala) Reddy as a judge in the State Courts”.</p>
    <p>In de­ci­sion grounds is­sued last month, the tri­bunal said that Mr Ravi should pay “a penalty that is suf­fi­cient and ap­pro­pri­ate to the mis­con­duct com­mit­ted”.</p>
    <p>It added that the sum “should not be less than $10,000”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi was also or­dered to pay $3,000 in costs to the Law So­ci­ety which pros­e­cuted the case.</p>
    <p>The Law So­ci­ety, act­ing on a com­plaint by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral in Au­gust last year, laid out three charges against Mr Ravi un­der dif­fer­ent sec­tions of the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion Act read with the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion (Pro­fes­sional Con­duct) Rules.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi’s at­tacks were con­tained in the me­dia state­ment he is­sued at a press con­fer­ence in Kuala Lumpur on July 23 last year, to­gether with a Malaysian civil so­ci­ety group.</p>
    <p>It was also posted on the same day on­line as part of an ar­ti­cle ti­tled “Mis­car­riage of Jus­tice – the ur­gency of spar­ing the life of Malaysian Na­gen­thran on Death Row in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>The first charge re­ferred to three state­ments that at­tacked the im­par­tial­ity and in­tegrity of state pros­e­cu­tors in Sin­ga­pore. The sec­ond charge re­ferred to a sim­i­lar num­ber of state­ments that con­tained un­sup­ported at­tacks against Se­nior District Judge Reddy, a sit­ting judge of the State Courts, al­leg­ing he was bi­ased against de­fence psy­chi­a­trists.</p>
    <p>The tri­bunal found the third charge against Mr Ravi, which in­volved al­le­ga­tions lev­elled against the ju­di­ciary, was not made out.</p>
    <p>On Aug 20 last year, his then lawyer, Mr Eu­gene Thu­raisingam, in­formed the Law So­ci­ety that Mr Ravi had with­drawn the al­le­ga­tions and apol­o­gised un­con­di­tion­ally, en­clos­ing a screen­shot of the apol­ogy on Mr Ravi’s Face­book post.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ravi con­tested the charges at the DT hear­ing in March de­spite hav­ing ear­lier apol­o­gised and with­drawn the me­dia state­ment.</p>
    <p>The tri­bunal, af­ter con­sid­er­ing the ev­i­dence, found him guilty of two al­ter­nate charges of mis­con­duct un­be­fit­ting an ad­vo­cate and so­lic­i­tor as an of­fi­cer of the Supreme Court or as a mem­ber of an honourable pro­fes­sion within the mean­ing of Sec­tion 83(2)(h) of the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion Act (Cap 161).</p>
    <p>The tri­bunal said: “For the al­ter­nate charges, we do not need to make a de­fin­i­tive find­ing as to whether (Mr Ravi) was act­ing in a pro­fes­sional or per­sonal ca­pac­ity since S 83(2)(h) of the LPA en­com­passes con­duct in both ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“It is well es­tab­lished that ‘con­duct un­be­fit­ting an ad­vo­cate and so­lic­i­tor’ is not con­fined to mis­con­duct in the le­gal prac­ti­tioner’s pro­fes­sional ca­pac­ity but also ex­tends to mis­con­duct in the prac­ti­tioner’s per­sonal ca­pac­ity. In other words, S 83(2)(h) en­com­passes, rather than ex­cludes, mis­con­duct in the le­gal prac­ti­tioner’s pro­fes­sional ca­pac­ity.”</p>
