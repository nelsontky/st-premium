    <p>Mr Leong Sze Hian may not have known that the al­le­ga­tions he shared were false, but he made no at­tempt to as­cer­tain the truth ei­ther way, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, tak­ing the wit­ness stand in the sec­ond half of yes­ter­day’s defama­tion hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Mr Leong’s lawyer, Mr Lim Tean, who had asked why PM Lee ac­cused his client of mal­ice when he did not know the truth, PM Lee told the High Court: “Be­cause he didn’t take the trou­ble to know. This is reck­less dis­re­gard of the truth.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee is su­ing Mr Leong over a post the blog­ger shared on his Face­book page on Nov 7, 2018, which con­tained a link to an ar­ti­cle by Malaysian news site The Cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle con­tained al­le­ga­tions that for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak had signed “se­cret deals” with PM Lee in ex­change for</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore banks’ help in laun­der­ing money from scan­dal-rid­den Malaysian state fund 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had, or 1MDB.</p>
    <p>Its con­tent had been taken from the States Times Re­view (STR) site, owned by Sin­ga­porean Alex Tan Zhi Xiang, who lives in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the hear­ing, PM Lee was also asked at sev­eral points why he chose to sue Mr Leong, in­stead of Mr Tan and STR or The Cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim ar­gued Mr Leong’s pub­li­ca­tion of the ar­ti­cle was “tech­ni­cal and lim­ited”; he had merely shared it on Face­book with­out com­ment.</p>
    <p>“I dis­agree. Shar­ing is pub­li­ca­tion,” PM Lee said. “What more must you do be­fore you are counted as a pub­li­ca­tion?”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim asked: “Can you tell the court of a sin­gle liv­ing per­son who has thought the worse of you be­cause of the shar­ing of this ar­ti­cle by the de­fen­dant?”</p>
    <p>PM Lee said: “This is not the way we ap­proach such ques­tions. A very dam­ag­ing al­le­ga­tion is made, pub­lished, cir­cu­lated around. Ei­ther it is re­sponded to pub­licly and cleared, and I vin­di­cate my rep­u­ta­tion, or one more drop of poi­son sinks in.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim then asked if PM Lee would rather take ac­tion against the drop – re­fer­ring to his client – rather than the “ocean” that was STR and The Cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The drop was not Mr Leong, PM Lee replied. “The drop is each ac­cu­sa­tion against me that is not re­but­ted – whether Leong Sze Hian or STR or The Cov­er­age. It’s the same grave ac­cu­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>His de­ci­sion to sue Mr Leong was the best ap­proach he found af­ter con­sult­ing his lawyer, PM Lee said. He added that each time he does not clear his name, a lit­tle more dam­age is done and peo­ple will be­gin to won­der if there is some truth to the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The lawyer then asked if PM Lee would not have ob­tained bet­ter reme­dies had he sued Mr Tan and STR, to which PM Lee replied: “That’s for me and my le­gal coun­sel to de­cide.” Both The Cov­er­age and STR are out of Sin­ga­pore’s ju­ris­dic­tion, PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim then charged that Mr Leong was sued be­cause he was a staunch gov­ern­ment critic, say­ing he was picked to frighten oth­ers, not to pro­tect PM Lee’s rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“I did not do that,” PM Lee replied, adding that Mr Leong has been “a thorn in our side in a small way for a very long time”.</p>
    <p>He noted that Mr Leong had crit­i­cised many gov­ern­ment poli­cies on many oc­ca­sions and fo­rums, as he is en­ti­tled to. “And our an­swer to that is, in the end, put it to the test, the test of the bal­lot. Per­suade Sin­ga­pore­ans, see if Sin­ga­pore­ans sup­port you or whether they have faith in the Gov­ern­ment. In­deed, it was put to the test in the most re­cent gen­eral elec­tion a few months ago when your de­fen­dant and your­self stood in a GRC, con­tested in Jalan Be­sar GRC, and won 35 per cent of the vote. So that is the an­swer.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, who heads the Peo­ples Voice party, led a team that in­cluded Mr Leong in Jalan Be­sar GRC at the July 10 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also told the court that Mr Leong is “far from the most vo­cal or sharp or ef­fec­tive critic of the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment”. There are many who are more ef­fec­tive than him, who have not been sued, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim replied: “You ad­mit­ted that (Mr Leong) has been a thorn in the Gov­ern­ment’s side. That’s why you chose to sue him.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee re­sponded: “I’ve ex­plained to you that hav­ing borne this cross for so many years, there was no rea­son to sue him on the ba­sis of his crit­i­cisms. We have learnt to live with these ant bites.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim then said that other prom­i­nent crit­ics, such as for­mer pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Tan Kin Lian and Peo­ple’s Power Party chief Goh Meng Seng, had not been sued.</p>
    <p>He added: “The wit­ness had not sued other op­po­si­tion politi­cians, but chose to pick on the de­fen­dant be­cause he’s a staunch gov­ern­ment critic. And you were try­ing to strike fear in the Sin­ga­pore pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee re­sponded: “Your Hon­our, he flat­ters his client.”</p>
