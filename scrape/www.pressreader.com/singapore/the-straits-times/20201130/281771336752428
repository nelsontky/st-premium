    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s trade min­is­ter said China’s steps to curb im­ports of his coun­try’s goods are “ag­gres­sive” and un­der­mine con­fi­dence in the global eco­nomic re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We do see a much more ag­gres­sive or as­sertive China in terms of the way it en­gages with the world,” Mr Si­mon Birm­ing­ham said on ABC tele­vi­sion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“These types of ac­tions don’t just hurt Aus­tralian busi­nesses, they hurt their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts as well. They un­der­mine con­fi­dence in the global econ­omy, and that’s not good for the world’s re­cov­ery from Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>China has im­posed anti-dump­ing du­ties of up to 212 per cent on Aus­tralian wine, the lat­est in a raft of mea­sures that have af­fected im­ports from coal to cop­per to bar­ley.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween Bei­jing and Canberra have been ris­ing since 2018 when Aus­tralia barred Huawei Tech­nolo­gies from build­ing its 5G net­work.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions wors­ened this year af­ter Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Morrison called for an in­quiry into the ori­gins of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Asked if China’s be­hav­iour amounted to eco­nomic co­er­cion, Mr Birm­ing­ham said: “Right around the world, peo­ple are pos­ing that question and I un­der­stand why.”</p>
    <p>China is Aus­tralia’s largest trad­ing part­ner and the big­gest buyer of its wine. Aus­tralia has de­nied it is dump­ing wine in China, whose du­ties – from 107.1 per cent to 212.1 per cent – took ef­fect on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia had ear­lier re­sponded to the wine tar­iffs by warn­ing Bei­jing that its ac­tions could cre­ate a per­cep­tion among busi­nesses and coun­tries around the world that trade with China is risky.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses and coun­tries view­ing Bei­jing’s back­lash against Aus­tralia this year would see the “po­ten­tial that their trade, their busi­nesses, can be dis­rupted through these sort of un­war­ranted, un­sanc­tioned ac­tions that frankly don’t stand up”, Mr Birm­ing­ham told re­porters in Ade­laide last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>China has re­it­er­ated that it had “taken mea­sures on im­ported prod­ucts in ac­cor­dance with the law”.</p>
    <p>“Cer­tain peo­ple in Aus­tralia have clung to a Cold War men­tal­ity and ide­o­log­i­cal bi­ases,” Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said at a brief­ing in Bei­jing last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“They have taken China’s de­vel­op­ment as a threat and taken a se­ries of er­ro­neous deeds and words.</p>
    <p>“This is the rea­son why China and Aus­tralian re­la­tions have taken a nose­dive and are now stuck in the cur­rent dif­fi­cult situation.”</p>
    <p>Mr Birm­ing­ham in­di­cated that Aus­tralia may take China to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) over its move to halt im­ports of bar­ley, adding that ef­forts to resolve the is­sue through China’s do­mes­tic pro­cesses had been un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>“So now the WTO ap­peal for bar­ley is the next step,” he said. “And I ex­pect that that is the process that we will go through.”</p>
    <p>Mr Morrison yes­ter­day said the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment would look into as­sist­ing ex­porters hurt by China’s trade mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“It is a dif­fi­cult time and there are ten­sions,” he said on ABC ra­dio.</p>
    <p>“We will do ev­ery­thing we can to en­sure that we can try and ad­dress these trade is­sues that have come up with China.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, we’re very con­cerned about that.”</p>
