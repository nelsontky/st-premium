    <p>Lo­cal food and bev­er­age chain White Res­tau­rant, pop­u­lar for its white bee hoon, is look­ing at sell­ing off-the-shelf food prod­ucts and ex­pand­ing into the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Vic­tor Tay, 39, shared that the com­pany may also add ex­press out­lets to its cur­rent fleet of six restau­rants as part of its growth plans.</p>
    <p>These out­lets would be smaller, self-ser­vice restau­rants re­quir­ing fewer staff, he said.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son why we’re look­ing at smaller restau­rants is partly due to man­power con­straints, but also be­cause we’ve seen an in­crease in take­away and de­liv­ery or­ders dur­ing this Covid-19 pe­riod,” Mr Tay said.</p>
    <p>Open­ing these self-ser­vice out­lets would al­low it to meet take­away and de­liv­ery needs, and reach cus­tomers in parts of Sin­ga­pore its cur­rent restau­rants are un­able to cater to, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay and the com­pany’s re­cently hired chief ex­ec­u­tive Alan Wah were among the 60 small and</p>
    <p>medium-sized en­ter­prise (SME) lead­ers par­tic­i­pat­ing in the first run of the En­ter­prise Lead­er­ship for Trans­for­ma­tion pro­gramme, which was launched yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Be­sides ex­pand­ing its fleet of restau­rants here, White Res­tau­rant is also look­ing at sell­ing condi</p>
    <p>ments like its chilli sauce, and ready-to-eat ver­sions of its white bee hoon.</p>
    <p>“These prod­ucts can also be ex­ported for sale,” Mr Tay said.</p>
    <p>He hopes that the one-year pro­gramme will also help the firm bet­ter un­der­stand its op­por­tu­ni­ties</p>
    <p>over­seas, such as mar­kets it should ex­plore.</p>
    <p>So far, he has at­tended mod­ules on han­dling changes in man­age­ment and fi­nanc­ing, which have given him new in­sights.</p>
    <p>“As a small SME, you are usu­ally fire­fight­ing and fo­cus­ing on the</p>
    <p>day-to-day op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“But through this (fi­nance) mod­ule, (we can bet­ter un­der­stand is­sues such as) how to get fi­nanc­ing, how much re­serves we need to have,” Mr Tay said.</p>
