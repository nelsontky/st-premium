    <p>• Swiss At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Michael Lauber yes­ter­day of­fered to re­sign.</p>
    <p>This was af­ter a Swiss court con­cluded he lied to i nves­ti­ga­tors while his of­fice ex­am­ined al­leged cor­rup­tion sur­round­ing world foot­ball govern­ing body Fifa.</p>
    <p>“In the in­ter­ests of the in­sti­tu­tions I of­fer my res­ig­na­tion,” Lauber said in a state­ment, adding that he was con­cerned about the rep­u­ta­tion of the Of­fice of the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral.</p>
    <p>A fed­eral court said he had com­mit­ted sev­eral breaches of his of­fi­cial du­ties and lied to in­ves­ti­ga­tors while his of­fice ex­am­ined al­leged cor­rup­tion in foot­ball.</p>
    <p>Lauber made “im­plau­si­ble” state­ments about an undisclose­d meet­ing with Fifa pres­i­dent Gianni In­fantino in June 2017, the Fed­eral Ad­min­is­tra­tive Court (FAC) said.</p>
    <p>But Lauber in­sisted he did not lie. “How­ever, if they (the court) do not be­lieve me as at­tor­ney-gen­eral, then the Of­fice of the At­tor­neyGen­eral will be harmed,” he said.</p>
    <p>At­tor­ney-Gen­eral since 2012, the 54-year-old al­ready faced im­peach­ment pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>A spe­cial pros­e­cu­tor is re­view­ing crim­i­nal com­plaints against him and In­fantino, who has de­nied any wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Anti-cor­rup­tion cam­paign­ers ac­cuse Lauber of bungling a fraud trial over pay­ments linked to Ger­many’s 2006 World Cup.</p>
    <p>In March, he saw his pay cut by 8 per cent af­ter the watch­dog found that he told false­hoods and vi­o­lated codes of con­duct.</p>
    <p>He ap­pealed against the pun­ish­ment but the FAC only par­tially up­held his com­plaint.</p>
    <p>The court said Lauber and other par­tic­i­pants said they could not re­mem­ber the 2017 meet­ing with In­fantino.</p>
    <p>“This fact alone and var­i­ous other cir­cum­stances lead to the con­clu­sion that Lauber’s state­ments are im­plau­si­ble,” the court said.</p>
    <p>“Such a gap in mem­ory among sev­eral par­tic­i­pants is to be re­garded as ab­surd, ac­cord­ing to gen­eral ex­pe­ri­ence of life.”</p>
    <p>A mem­ber of Switzer­land’s par­lia­men­tary ju­di­cial com­mit­tee wel­comed Lauber’s de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“It was the best thing he could do at the mo­ment, there were too many al­le­ga­tions against him,” Ur­sula Sch­nei­der Schuet­tel told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“In his po­si­tion, the at­tor­ney-gen­eral has to be above sus­pi­cion and it would have been dam­ag­ing if he re­mained.”</p>
