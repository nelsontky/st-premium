    <p>Bei­jing edged towards a state of alarm as a flurry of Covid-19 cases sparked mass test­ing and lock­downs of some res­i­den­tial ar­eas, and caused mass gath­er­ings and per­for­mances to be can­celled. Some 18 lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases, the first do­mes­tic in­fec­tions in Bei­jing in more than 150 days, have been de­tected since Dec 14.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing edged towards a state of alarm yes­ter­day as a flurry of</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases in the Chi­nese cap­i­tal sparked mass test­ing, lock­downs of some res­i­den­tial ar­eas, and caused mass gath­er­ings and per­for­mances to be can­celled.</p>
    <p>Some 18 lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases, the first do­mes­tic in­fec­tions in Bei­jing in over 150 days, have been de­tected since Dec 14.</p>
    <p>Im­ple­ment­ing es­ca­lat­ing con­trols, city of­fi­cials an­nounced on Sun­day that Bei­jing was go­ing into “emer­gency mode”.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rate out­breaks have been re­ported in north­ern Liaon­ing prov­ince’s Dalian and Shenyang cities.</p>
    <p>The spike in cases has caused con­cern in parts of Bei­jing, par­tic­u­larly in the Shunyi dis­trict where the Bei­jing Cap­i­tal In­ter­na­tional Air­port is lo­cated, that the virus may be cir­cu­lat­ing un­de­tected.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the city com­pleted mass test­ing of all Shunyi dis­trict res­i­dents, which turned up no new cases. Close to 1.3 mil­lion tests have been con­ducted in the dis­trict since last week­end.</p>
    <p>Shunyi res­i­dent Tim Lin, who was screened on Sun­day, told The Straits Times that res­i­dents were “def­i­nitely afraid”.</p>
    <p>“I think peo­ple are pretty anx­ious be­cause there are quite a num­ber of el­derly peo­ple and young fam­i­lies liv­ing here,” said the 37-year-old prod­uct de­signer, who added that his com­pany had for­bid­den em­ploy­ees from go­ing to work un­less they could present a neg­a­tive nu­cleic acid test re­sult.</p>
    <p>The lat­est spate be­gan when a Chi­nese na­tional who ar­rived from Hong Kong devel­oped symp­toms after he was re­leased from quar­an­tine on Dec 13. Two cases linked to him were later dis­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, more cases were found, and seven were de­tected yes­ter­day. Most were in Shunyi dis­trict. So far the cases do not ap­pear to be linked to the man from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, 18 lo­cal trans­mis­sions have been recorded, ac­cord­ing to data from the Bei­jing Cen­tre for Dis­ease Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol (CDC).</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion for epi­demic pre­ven­tion and con­trol in Bei­jing is com­plex. We must be on high alert and strictly im­ple­ment mea­sures to pre­vent im­ported cases and a do­mes­tic re­bound,” Ms Pang Xinghuo, deputy di­rec­tor of the Bei­jing CDC, said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have put in place es­ca­lat­ing curbs since the week­end.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas, tourist spots and parks have been or­dered to op­er­ate at 75 per cent ca­pac­ity, and large per­for­mances and gath­er­ings have been sus­pended. Pri­mary and mid­dle school stu­dents have had their win­ter va­ca­tions brought for­ward to ear­lier in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Some 10 vil­lages, com­mu­ni­ties and build­ings in Shunyi have been sealed off, the author­i­ties said yes­ter­day, and civil ser­vants have been told to re­main in Bei­jing for the up­com­ing New Year hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>But Chi­nese epi­demi­o­log­i­cal ex­perts have said it is un­likely that the virus was spread­ing widely in Bei­jing as mass test­ing has so far not un­cov­ered hid­den cases.</p>
    <p>Dr Jin Dong-Yan, a virol­ogy pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong, said the seven cases re­ported yes­ter­day were all close con­tacts of pre­vi­ous in­fec­tions and not picked up through mass test­ing. “The num­bers are low. There is no sign the virus is spread­ing widely,” said Dr Jin.</p>
    <p>He noted the Bei­jing author­i­ties’ lan­guage on the re­cent spate of cases – terms like “emer­gency mode” and get­ting on a “war foot­ing” – seemed geared in­stead at jolt­ing a pop­u­lace fa­tigued by var­i­ous social dis­tanc­ing mea­sures back into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“The real con­cern is the com­ing hol­i­day sea­son, be­cause a lot of peo­ple will be trav­el­ling, and if an in­fected in­di­vid­ual goes un­de­tected there could be a real risk of a su­per-spreader event. The gov­ern­ment’s main task is to pre­vent this from hap­pen­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion for epi­demic pre­ven­tion and con­trol in Bei­jing is com­plex. We must be on high alert and strictly im­ple­ment mea­sures to pre­vent im­ported cases and a do­mes­tic ’’ re­bound.</p>
    <p>MS PANG XINGHUO, deputy di­rec­tor of the Bei­jing Cen­tre for Dis­ease Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol.</p>
