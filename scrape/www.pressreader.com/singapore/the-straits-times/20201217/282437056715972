    <p>• Slaven Bilic yes­ter­day be­came the first man­age­rial ca­su­alty of the Pre­mier League cam­paign af­ter West Bromwich Al­bion fired the Croa­t­ian af­ter 18 months in charge.</p>
    <p>A club state­ment read: “West Bromwich Al­bion have today parted com­pany with head coach Slaven Bilic.</p>
    <p>“Al­bion would like to thank Slaven and his coach­ing staff for their ef­forts in achiev­ing pro­mo­tion last sea­son and wishes them all well in the fu­ture. The club will make no fur­ther com­ment at this time.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to mul­ti­ple Bri­tish me­dia re­ports, Sam Al­lardyce is set to take over as the short-term man­ager for six months. The for­mer Eng­land boss has not coached since be­ing sacked by Ever­ton in May 2018, while Bilic led the Bag­gies to pro­mo­tion in his first full sea­son in charge,</p>
    <p>West Brom man­aged to garner a sur­prise 1-1 league draw at Manch­ester City on Tues­day, but the point was not enough to keep Bilic in the job.</p>
    <p>They re­main sec­ond from bot­tom on seven points with one win in 13 games, lead­ing City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola to curse their in­abil­ity to put away the lowly vis­i­tors, who cancelled out lkay Gun­do­gan’s opener via Ruben Dias’ own goal.</p>
    <p>The hosts re­main out of the top four and the Cata­lan is wor­ried the two points dropped could prove costly in their bid to re­gain the league ti­tle.</p>
    <p>“It is not about the points (off the top), you have to win games like this,” said Guardi­ola. “We know it, we drop points. These are the ones you have to win.</p>
    <p>“It’s not far away to the top of the league but you have to beat West Brom at home. You don’t have to be so clever to see the gap be­tween this year and pre­vi­ous years (in our re­sults). It is not con­fi­dence, Ser­gio Aguero is in­jured for four months, but we cre­ate chances, we are there, we just can’t score.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Gun­do­gan blamed the con­gested cal­en­dar, say­ing: “All over Europe, all the big teams are strug­gling with the tight fix­tures and it’s not go­ing to be eas­ier in the next weeks. That’s an ex­pla­na­tion why it is not al­ways as easy as the ex­pec­ta­tions peo­ple have for us. We are not ma­chines but we also know when we have not played our best game.”</p>
