    <p>The pages of a book con­tain more se­crets than are printed on them. Flick through them and the past falls out. Re­cently, a friend bor­rowed a book from me and found, amid the leaves, a “thank you” card from my neph­ews when they were young boys.</p>
    <p>Now, they are 17 and 15, but that post­card about an English sum­mer is our shared history, a re­minder of love, fam­ily, foot­ball and who we were then. I put the card back in the book. It was like re­bury­ing a lovely trea­sure.</p>
    <p>Every­one has a book story. Every­one who reads be­comes a sto­ry­teller. Every­one can re­late a tale of where a book came from and what it meant to him or her one rough win­ter. Every­one has a favourite pas­sage, a dog­matic view on dog-ear­ing, an odd book-stack­ing style and a book cover which re­mains un­for­get­table. Mine is the im­age of fish­er­folk on Ami­tav Ghosh’s</p>
    <p>The Hun­gry Tide.</p>
    <p>Ec­cen­tric­ity is the thread that ties us. Peo­ple sten­cil their names in books, some note the town of pur­chase, oth­ers the year, a few just the month. “May, Rome.” A sum­mer read among ru­ins. One woman can date her books through the colour of the ink she once used. This re­quires an ex­pla­na­tion. “I go through phases,” she said, “with one colour or the other and that’s why the colour of the ink I write my name in is im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have books they won’t let go of, as if that part of their life must al­ways be car­ried. What else lasts through the years? Even old clocks run out of time. My Ger­man friend Nici, 54, still has a Handilex­i­con, or en­cy­clopae­dia, from her sev­enth birth­day, an en­dur­ing re­minder of a child’s cu­rios­ity. I have a copy of</p>
    <p>The Fight from 1986, a ragged clue to an early ro­mance with writer Nor­man Mailer and boxer Muham­mad Ali.</p>
    <p>I of­ten send out What­sApp mes­sages to peo­ple about col­umns I am re­search­ing on age and fam­ily, but a query on books elic­its the most replies.</p>
    <p>For this, peo­ple hap­pily dust off their mem­o­ries. In a grim Covid-19 time, whimsy is a lovely dis­trac­tion, so I asked peo­ple about in­scrip­tions and the things they had found in books.</p>
    <p>Tales lit­tered my in­box: of an­cient re­ceipts, dis­em­barka­tion cards and grand­fa­ther’s let­ters; of a ho­tel room key card from Rwanda found amid the pages of a book in New York; of names writ­ten in books only to stop steal­ing sis­ters.</p>
    <p>On my par­ents’ shelves sits a copy of pri­ma­tol­o­gist Jane Goodall’s book, In The Shadow Of Man, which is now bound in yel­low elec­tri­cian tape. My fa­ther raised us to tales of her and chim­panzees and when my brother once met Goodall at a talk and told her about it, she signed the book to my dad: “For Ra­jen, to­gether we can change the world.” He kept it as if it had ar­rived from some zo­o­log­i­cal Vat­i­can.</p>
    <p>These days, on re­quest, stores will wrap a book exquisitel­y be­fore we hand it over to friends, but once a fun­da­men­tal part of the gift was the in­scrip­tion. That pause for a minute, the form­ing of a thought, the scratch of a pen – it all added a per­sonal layer to the book.</p>
    <p>In­deed, when a per­son is gone, one of the most in­ti­mate and last­ing things is his or her scrib­ble. My old pal Clay­ton keeps his mother’s Bi­ble care­fully, not be­cause he is par­tic­u­larly re­li­gious, but be­cause on the last page, writ­ten in her hand, is the tim­ing, day and date of his and his brothers’ births. He has no other ev­i­dence of her hand­writ­ing.</p>
    <p>In­scrip­tions are de­lib­er­ate, but the lock of hair used as a book­mark is an ac­ci­dent and a mys­tery. Who, apart from a bar­ber, has a loose lock ly­ing around?</p>
    <p>And so the item stum­bled upon in a book re­quires its own leap of imag­i­na­tion. Joy comes from flight. As a pressed flower – a com­mon find – crum­bles as you lift it, do you ever won­der about the gar­den it came from?</p>
    <p>In books found on a pub­lic ex­change shelf, Joey Chin, the writer and artist, dis­cov­ered a sprin­kling of quaint things.</p>
    <p>A note that be­gan “Dear But­ter­fly, I saw this and thought of you”. A hand­writ­ten let­ter from a time when pen­man­ship was pre­cious. A Dic­tionary of Modern English</p>
    <p>Us­age by H.W. Fowler, awarded as a school prize in 1939, which was a re­minder that once dic­tio­nar­ies had such value.</p>
    <p>As she told her sto­ries, my smile grew wider.</p>
    <p>So much that is found is pro­saic, yet they can be tiny win­dows to peo­ple and the past. Deepika, a friend, once found a let­ter from her grand­fa­ther to her mother when she was a girl in board­ing school in the late 1950s. Her mother was ev­i­dently strug­gling with some­thing, for her grand­fa­ther, in a gently philo­soph­i­cal let­ter writ­ten with an el­e­gant hand, told her that “life is not al­ways as you plan it”.</p>
    <p>Deepika’s grand­fa­ther died when she was two years old and this let­ter, and other post­cards she found tucked into books in her mother’s fam­ily home, al­lowed her to draw a colour­ful sketch of a man she couldn’t re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>I wan­dered into Ana book store and owner Mohd Noorul Is­lam showed me Hong Kong stamps he’d chanced upon in sec­ond-hand books. In The New York Times’ Modern Love series, I read about a young cou­ple who left Post-it re­views in li­brary books.</p>
    <p>Some­times, the of­fer­ing is a lit­tle larger and un­in­ten­tional. Mr Ian Yap, di­rec­tor of pub­lic li­brary op­er­a­tions at the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB), laughs as he re­mem­bers a staff mem­ber find­ing $200 in a re­turned book. The reader was con­tacted and re­paid the li­brary’s hon­esty with a box of choco­lates.</p>
    <p>NLB staff, says Mr Yap, have found ATM cards within pages, photos, iden­ti­fi­ca­tion cards, draw­ings and quo­ta­tions on pieces of pa­per when they ex­am­ine books for bulges. But with 29 mil­lion book loans a year, not each one can be checked and so who knows the trea­sures out there?</p>
    <p>Things are in­ad­ver­tently left in books, like a post­card read and slid be­tween pages, but of­ten we use what’s avail­able as a book­mark. Read­ing is an act in­ter­rupted by pauses, but it’s vi­tal that we never lose our place. The but­ter chicken recipe we cut out yes­ter­day be­comes an im­pro­vised book­mark and it al­lows us to re­sume a story from where we stopped.</p>
    <p>But once the book is done, we ex­hale and move on. We re­turn it, un­know­ingly with the recipe in­side, to a li­brary, let a friend bor­row it or do­nate it to a sec­ond-hand shop, and the book starts its quiet wan­der through a city. Car­ry­ing a lit­tle bit of us to a stranger and, most cru­cially, spread­ing the gospel of but­ter chicken.</p>
