    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing in Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ued to grow last month, with the elec­tron­ics sec­tor steal­ing the show by re­turn­ing to ex­pan­sion­ary mode af­ter con­tract­ing for six straight months. Last month’s read­ing of the Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) re­leased yes­ter­day came in at 50.1 points, keep­ing an ex­pan­sion­ary stance, although growth was down 0.1 point from July, when it rose by 1.2 points.</p>
    <p>A PMI read­ing over 50 in­di­cates ex­pan­sion, while one be­low 50 shows con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics sec­tor’s PMI rose by 1.4 points to 50.6, the high­est level since Septem­ber 2018. An­a­lysts noted this in­di­cates a sil­ver lin­ing for the sec­tor, as de­mand for semi­con­duc­tors for data centres and cloud ser­vices demon­strated re­silience amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Cheap val­u­a­tions, strong links to the global econ­omy and bet­ter con­trol over the pan­demic are all seen as work­ing to the ad­van­tage of shares in the city-state, where cycli­cals such as fi­nan­cials and real es­tate com­mand a more than 80 per cent weight­ing in the bench­mark in­dex.</p>
    <p>Stocks in Sin­ga­pore ap­pear to be the best placed in Asia-Pa­cific to ben­e­fit from a po­ten­tial cycli­cal re­cov­ery and suc­cess in find­ing a cure for the coro­n­avirus, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>Cheap val­u­a­tions, strong links to the global econ­omy and bet­ter con­trol over the pan­demic are all seen as work­ing to the ad­van­tage of shares in the city-state, where cycli­cals such as fi­nan­cials and real es­tate com­mand a more than 80 per cent weight­ing in the bench­mark in­dex.</p>
    <p>UBS Global Wealth Man­age­ment’s head of Asia-Pa­cific equities and credit Hart­mut Is­sel said that “we rate Sin­ga­pore one of our most pre­ferred mar­kets in the re­gion”, backed by “re­ces­sion val­u­a­tions” and ex­pec­ta­tions of an earn­ings re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Stocks whose for­tunes are heav­ily tied to busi­ness cy­cles are gain­ing in­vestor at­ten­tion amid nascent signs of a re­vival in world trade, some im­prove­ment in Asia’s man­u­fac­tur­ing gauges and promis­ing up­dates by drug­mak­ers rac­ing to de­velop a coro­n­avirus vac­cine.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts forecast that the Straits Times In­dex (STI) will climb about 15 per cent in the next 12 months, ver­sus an 11 per cent gain seen for the broader MSCI Asia-Pa­cific In­dex.</p>
    <p>At about 84 per cent, the weight­ing of cycli­cal stocks in the STI gauge makes for the high­est ex­po­sure among ma­jor bench­marks in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>That is even af­ter ex­clud­ing pan­demic win­ners like tech­nol­ogy and com­mu­ni­ca­tion ser­vices. Banks (41 per cent), real es­tate (22 per cent) and industrial­s (17 per cent) are the most dom­i­nant sec­tors.</p>
    <p>HSBC Pri­vate Bank­ing is bet­ting on div­i­dend-pay­ing prop­erty man­agers as Sin­ga­pore strives to re­sume busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties. UBS favours banks, cit­ing their re­gion­alised busi­ness model, which means lenders will ben­e­fit once economies re­bound. Any rise in US Trea­sury yields will also be a boon for their net in­ter­est mar­gins.</p>
    <p>That said, many things need to fall into place for a sus­tained re­bound in the city-state’s shares.</p>
    <p>The trade-re­liant econ­omy shrank by a record mar­gin last quar­ter, and the Govern­ment ex­pects a con­trac­tion of 5 per cent to 7 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>While only a hand­ful of daily new virus cases have been reg­is­tered re­cently, Sin­ga­pore has faced a tu­mul­tuous road cop­ing with the is­sue, and Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Chan Chun Sing last month warned of “re­cur­ring waves of in­fec­tion and dis­rup­tion”.</p>
    <p>This year’s steep de­cline – the sec­ond-worst in Asia-Pa­cific – has cheap­ened the val­u­a­tion of shares. Down 21 per cent so far, the STI gauge is trad­ing at 0.9 times its es­ti­mated book value, ver­sus an av­er­age of 1.2 over the past decade.</p>
    <p>Mr James Cheo, HSBC’s chief mar­ket strate­gist for South-east Asia, said: “If there is a rise in global rates cou­pled with a strong do­mes­tic eco­nomic and earn­ings re­cov­ery, the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket could do well visa-vis peers.”</p>
