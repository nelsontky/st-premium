    <p>TAIPEI • A key supplier to Ap­ple and a dozen other tech gi­ants plans to split its sup­ply chain be­tween the Chi­nese mar­ket and the United States, declar­ing that China’s time as fac­tory to the world is fin­ished be­cause of the trade war.</p>
    <p>Hon Hai Pre­ci­sion In­dus­try chair­man Liu Young-way said it is grad­u­ally ad­ding more ca­pac­ity outside of China, the main base of pro­duc­tion for gad­gets from iPhones to Dell desk­tops to Nin­tendo Switches. The pro­por­tion outside the coun­try is now at 30 per cent, up from 25 per cent in June last year.</p>
    <p>That ra­tio will rise as the firm – also known as Fox­conn – moves more man­u­fac­tur­ing to South-east Asia and other re­gions to avoid es­ca­lat­ing tar­iffs on Chi­nese-made goods headed to US mar­kets, Mr Liu told re­porters after his com­pany re­ported fi­nan­cial re­sults.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter if it’s In­dia, South­east Asia or the Amer­i­cas, there will be a man­u­fac­tur­ing ecosys­tem in each,” Mr Liu said in a con­fer­ence call with i nvestors, ad­ding that while China will still play a key role in Fox­conn’s man­u­fac­tur­ing em­pire, the coun­try’s “days as the world’s fac­tory are done”.</p>
    <p>Fox­conn said in a state­ment yesterday that, con­trary to “in­ac­cu­rate me­dia re­ports”, the man­age­ment’s com­ments dur­ing the call did not re­fer to any spe­cific com­pa­nies, fa­cil­i­ties or prod­ucts, and were in­tended to re­flect macroe­co­nomic and in­dus­try trends.</p>
    <p>In­ten­si­fy­ing trade ten­sions be­tween Washington and Bei­jing have pushed de­vice man­u­fac­tur­ers to di­ver­sify their pro­duc­tion bases away from China, and Mr Liu last year said Ap­ple’s most prized prod­uct, the iPhone, can be made outside China if needed. The two nations re­main in trade talks, but Mr Liu’s com­ments af­firm a grow­ing ex­pec­ta­tion that the China-cen­tric elec­tron­ics sup­ply chain will frag­ment over the longer term.</p>
    <p>The Tai­wanese firm re­ported bet­ter-than-ex­pected net in­come of NT$22.9 bil­lion (S$1.07 bil­lion) for the quar­ter ended in June, a pe­riod that saw in­creased de­mand for iPads and Mac­Books. Rev­enue was NT$1.13 tril­lion, but Hon Hai warned it ex­pects its third-quar­ter sales will be down by dou­ble dig­its rel­a­tive to last year. Ap­ple is ex­pected to de­lay its iPhone launch this year.</p>
    <p>Hon Hai is bounc­ing back from a record first-quar­ter profit slump as out­put at its fac­to­ries re­cover and stay-home or­ders spur de­mand for home com­put­ing equip­ment.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic likely boosted iPad and Mac sales, even as Ap­ple store clo­sures weighed on iPhone sales, Ap­ple chief ex­ec­u­tive Tim Cook said on July 31, after re­port­ing quar­terly rev­enue that crushed es­ti­mates. Ap­ple ac­counts for half of Hon Hai’s sales.</p>
    <p>Even as Ap­ple out­per­formed, Hon Hai’s other cus­tomers have fared less well. Hong Kong-listed sub­sidiary FIH Mo­bile said in its Aug 7 earn­ings re­lease that while Huawei’s new phones have been pop­u­lar in China, they missed ex­pec­ta­tions else­where fol­low­ing US sanc­tions. An­other key cus­tomer, Xiaomi, suf­fered a back­lash in the In­dian mar­ket amid grow­ing ten­sions be­tween China and the South</p>
    <p>Asian coun­try. FIH lost US$100 mil­lion (S$137 mil­lion) in the first half.</p>
    <p>Fox­conn has been shak­ing up its tra­di­tion­ally China-fo­cused op­er­a­tions. It is among Ap­ple assem­bly part­ners that plan to ex­pand in In­dia, po­ten­tially help­ing the iPhone maker grow its pres­ence in the coun­try of 1.3 bil­lion and shift some of the US com­pany’s sup­ply chain outside of China as ties be­tween Washington and Bei­jing fray.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese ri­vals are also pos­ing a grow­ing chal­lenge. Lo­cal elec­tron­ics ti­tan Luxshare Pre­ci­sion In­dus­try is poised to be­come the first Chi­nese home-grown iPhone as­sem­bler after seal­ing a deal last month to buy an Ap­ple hand­set pro­duc­tion plant from Wistron. While Hon Hai will keep assem­bly or­ders for pre­mium iPhones, Luxshare will eat into the busi­ness for mid-to-en­try-level Ap­ple hand­sets, Fubon Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Arthur Liao wrote in a July 23 note.</p>
    <p>Fox­conn will work on its com­po­nent busi­ness to main­tain tech lead­er­ship and it also ben­e­fits from its long-term re­la­tion­ship with Ap­ple, Mr Liu said in re­sponse to an­a­lysts’ ques­tions about Fox­conn’s com­pet­i­tive strat­egy against the ris­ing Chi­nese supplier.</p>
    <p>Or­ders could be fur­ther hit after US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is­sued an ex­ec­u­tive or­der bar­ring US res­i­dents from do­ing busi­ness with Ten­cent Hold­ings’ WeChat. An­nual iPhone ship­ments could plunge by 25 per cent to 30 per cent if Ap­ple is forced to re­move the app from its global app stores, TF In­ter­na­tional Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Kuo Ming-chi warned in an Aug 9 note.</p>
