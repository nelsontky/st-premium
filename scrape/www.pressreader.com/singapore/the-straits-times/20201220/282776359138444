    <p>It was the prac­tice round of the es­teemed 2005 Bar­clays Sin­ga­pore Open event at Sen­tosa’s highly-ac­claimed Serapong course.</p>
    <p>Eng­land’s much-cel­e­brated golfer Lee West­wood, who rose to fame by be­ing Europe’s No. 1 player for a long spell in the 1990s and 2000s, changed his shirt yet again as he am­bled on to the sec­ond nine of the chal­leng­ing par-71 lay­out.</p>
    <p>But if you thought that he dreaded the heat, you are mis­taken. For he seems to en­joy the hu­mid­ity and be­ing re­freshed by the oc­ca­sional waft of cool breeze around the idyl­lic is­land, his beam­ing smiles and shoul­der shrugs indi­cat­ing ex­pres­sions of joy.</p>
    <p>A pop­u­lar golfer in this part of the world, es­pe­cially in Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia, which seems to be his favourite hunt­ing ground that pro­vided him sev­eral ti­tles, West­wood, with his easy gait and con­fi­dent air of author­ity al­ways woos the fans.</p>
    <p>The af­fa­ble West­wood once said: “The Sin­ga­pore Open is the flag­ship event of the Asian Tour, it is a mas­sive event and it is be­ing played in a great place. I love com­ing here and it is good to be back.”</p>
    <p>The run­ner-up to Aus­tralian Adam Scott in the year when the Sin­ga­pore Open was res­ur­rected by Bar­clays Bank af­ter a three-year hia­tus from 2002 to 2004 is a tough man to beat on any course, be it in the United States, Europe or Asia.</p>
    <p>And with his most re­cent tri­umph in the Race to Dubai Euro­pean Tour event at the age of 47, he showed that age is only a num­ber when he over­came a bunch of young up­starts in the pop­u­lar tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a nail-bit­ing fin­ish to the event in Dubai last Sun­day with Eng­land’s Matt Fitzpa­trick end­ing tops in the DP World Tour Cham­pi­onship, West­wood was con­tent with the run­ner-up spot that pro­pelled him to the sum­mit of the Race to Dubai stand­ings.</p>
    <p>His sec­ond-place fin­ish on 14-un­der par af­ter a four-un­der 68 on the fi­nal day en­sured that he claimed the big­gest prize af­ter a se­ries of melt­downs by his ri­vals at the Jumeirah Golf Es­tates.</p>
    <p>US Masters win­ner in 2018, Pa­trick Reed, seek­ing to be­come the first Amer­i­can to be Europe’s top player, bo­geyed Nos. 16 and 17 to drop out of con­tention for the Race to Dubai ti­tle. Then Lau­rie Can­ter dou­ble-bo­geyed No. 17 and could only par the last, leav­ing West­wood alone in sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Fitzpa­trick’s par at No. 18 se­cured him a one-shot vic­tory to win the Tour’s sea­son-end­ing event for the sec­ond time, af­ter 2016, but West­wood was al­ready cel­e­brat­ing a big­ger prize af­ter watch­ing the fi­nal holes in the scor­ing hut with his girl­friend, who cad­died for him as well.</p>
    <p>“It was a great fin­ish,” West­wood said af­ter mak­ing five birdies and one bo­gey. “I sat there watch­ing it — it’s al­ways ex­cit­ing this tour­na­ment, com­ing down the stretch and there’s al­ways thrills and spills.</p>
    <p>“There was the Race to Dubai up for the grabs, the tour­na­ment. It was an ex­cit­ing end to the year. It’s hard to quan­tify.”</p>
    <p>West­wood, who won US$2 mil­lion for fin­ish­ing at the top, added: “It was a bizarre sea­son. The Euro­pean Tour have done an in­cred­i­ble job to pick the sea­son up again from July and have tour­na­ments ev­ery week.”</p>
    <p>West­wood, who sup­ports Not­ting­ham For­est in the English league, won what was for­merly known as the Or­der of Merit ti­tle for the first time 20 years ago at Valder­rama, and again in 2009 in Dubai.</p>
    <p>A top-ranked player, West­wood is renowned for be­ing one of the great­est golfers never to win a Ma­jor (he fin­ished run­ner-up three times), but there’s no doubt­ing his sta­tus as an el­der states­man on the Euro­pean Tour.</p>
    <p>And he staked strong claims to be a shoo-in for a place in the Euro­pean team for next year’s post­poned Ry­der Cup at Whistling Straits. It would be his 11th ap­pear­ance in golf’s big­gest team event.</p>
    <p>“The Ry­der Cup would be great if I got in again,” West­wood said, be­fore hes­i­tat­ing. “I would love to play again but at some point I’m hop­ing the cap­taincy will be of­fered to me. I would love to do that.</p>
    <p>“At cer­tain times, you’ve got to move into dif­fer­ent chap­ters of your life. It’s nice to watch th­ese young kids play, they tear it up out there. I en­joyed the Ry­der Cup last time out when I was vice-cap­tain. It’s a lot less pres­sure than hav­ing to hit the greens and hole the putts your­self.”</p>
    <p>Fitzpa­trick, 26, praised West­wood, say­ing: “Lee is just the def­i­ni­tion of the Tour, isn’t he? Just a phe­nom­e­nal player, and has been for so long now. I can’t speak highly enough of him.”</p>
    <p>Noted for his con­sis­tency, West­wood is one of the few play­ers who has won tour­na­ments on five con­ti­nents – Europe, Amer­ica, Asia, Africa and Ocea­nia – in­clud­ing vic­to­ries on the Euro­pean Tour and the US PGA Tour.</p>
    <p>He be­came the world’s No. 1 player in Oc­to­ber, 2010, end­ing the reign of Tiger Woods and be­com­ing the first Bri­tish player since Nick Faldo in 1994 to hold the es­teemed po­si­tion.</p>
