    <p>If 2020 was the year of the coro­n­avirus, 2021 will be the year Covid-19 con­tin­ues to cast a long shadow.</p>
    <p>Even as news of ef­fec­tive vac­cines cheers the world, the re­al­ity is that the jour­ney to a postCovid-19 world will be long drawn, and the months ahead will re­main dark­ened by the scourge of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore, the key chal­lenge of this year will be the roll-out of the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore is well schooled in such mass oper­a­tions, noth­ing is cer­tain in this un­prece­dented global ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Take ac­cess to vac­cines. De­spite ad­vance pur­chase or­ders, Sin­ga­pore is still com­pet­ing with many other coun­tries to get hold of the vac­cines. It has hedged its bets by pur­chas­ing vac­cines from three sources: On Dec 21, it was the first coun­try in Asia to re­ceive doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vac­cine; it has also placed or­ders for the vac­cines by Moderna and Si­no­vac, and is in talks on a few oth­ers.</p>
    <p>But be­tween plac­ing or­ders and de­liv­ery, many things can hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Sup­ply may not be enough; some coun­tries may re­sort to com­man­deer­ing the vac­cines for their own pop­u­la­tion; ship­ments may be de­layed, or lost due to piracy; dis­tri­bu­tion may de­stroy or cor­rupt the vac­cines’ ef­fec­tive­ness, es­pe­cially given that some need to be stored at very low tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>Once in Sin­ga­pore, another set of challenges arises: the lo­gis­tics of dis­tribut­ing the vac­cines and then the com­mu­ni­ca­tions chal­lenge of</p>
    <p>With Sin­ga­pore hailed in re­cent months as a model, gold stan­dard or some kind of bell­wether of Covid-19 man­age­ment, it is not only Sin­ga­pore­ans, but the world, ex­pect­ing this tiny city state to be first off the mark when the post-Covid-19 recovery whis­tle blows.</p>
    <p>get­ting 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion to be vac­ci­nated, when it is not com­pul­sory.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has said all Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents should be able to get vac­ci­nated by the end of this year. Vac­ci­na­tion is free.</p>
    <p>A suc­cess­ful tran­si­tion to a post-Covid-19 world hinges on the abil­ity to get the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme un­der way smoothly. Do­ing this will keep Sin­ga­pore safe from the ex­treme ef­fects of this virus, al­low the econ­omy to func­tion, and per­mit open­ing of bor­ders. A cau­tious re­turn to nor­malcy will then be pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>This is the best-case sce­nario. How­ever, risks re­main.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, health ex­perts are brac­ing them­selves for a resur­gence of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In Europe and Amer­ica, the virus seems to be re­bound­ing with a vengeance with a new, more trans­mis­si­ble strain cir­cu­lat­ing. Sin­ga­pore has al­ready had cases of this im­ported strain, but has kept them un­der con­trol so far. It is likely that more im­ported cases will slip into Sin­ga­pore and even­tu­ally into the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>So even as Sin­ga­pore­ans en­joy the greater free­doms un­der phase three mea­sures that kicked in on Mon­day, the irony is that such loos­en­ing may has­ten the spread of fu­ture com­mu­nity out­breaks.</p>
    <p>One key event to watch out for this year is the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) meet­ing here, from May 13 to 16. The WEF chose Sin­ga­pore to host its an­nual talk­fest of lead­ers, tra­di­tion­ally held in the snow-capped ski town of Davos in Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore won con­fi­dence among busi­ness trav­ellers dur­ing the pan­demic for its pro­to­cols that i nclude seg­re­gated travel lanes. These pro­vide a “bub­ble” to bring trav­ellers from air­plane to ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties where they stay and work, with Covid-19 tests pre-de­par­ture, on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and through­out their stay.</p>
    <p>A suc­cess­ful WEF meet­ing with no in­fec­tion clus­ter will at­tract more con­ven­tion travel into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the long tail of the coro­n­avirus will con­tinue to lash busi­nesses, with more ex­pected to floun­der when govern­ment grants ta­per off. The Jobs Sup­port Scheme’s last two pay­outs to co­pay salaries are in March and June. Al­ready, an­a­lysts warn of ris­ing bankrupt­cies this year.</p>
    <p>Jobs will re­main a ma­jor pre­oc­cu­pa­tion, with more losses feared as com­pa­nies close down. With herd im­mu­nity grad­u­ally be­ing achieved, thou­sands of Covid-19-re­lated jobs like those of safe-dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors will dis­ap­pear, adding to the job crunch. How­ever, for­eign worker quo­tas are be­ing tight­ened, which might boost de­mand for lo­cal labour.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, an ac­tivist govern­ment will con­tinue with the pace of pol­icy changes.</p>
    <p>In health, na­tional health in­sur­ance plan MediShield Life will ex­pand cov­er­age but raise pre­mi­ums by up to 35 per cent in 2021. (Sub­si­dies will cover 70 per cent of this in­crease this year.)</p>
    <p>In hous­ing, a novel form of as­sisted liv­ing for se­niors is be­ing launched in the public hous­ing town of Bukit Ba­tok in March. Hous­ing sub­si­dies will also be tweaked to make new flats in cen­tral ar­eas more af­ford­able. Both are ma­jor pol­icy in­no­va­tions to meet evolv­ing needs.</p>
    <p>On the pri­vate hous­ing front, my col­league Grace Leong, who cov­ers hous­ing, says: “En bloc sales may start to make a come­back af­ter a three-year hia­tus. As new home sales con­tinue to sur­prise on the up­side de­spite the un­cer­tain eco</p>
    <p>nomic en­vi­ron­ment, and un­sold in­ven­tory con­tin­ues to de­plete, an­a­lysts say this could trig­ger a re­ac­ti­va­tion of col­lec­tive sale ten­ders.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent un­sold in­ven­tory stands at 26,600 units. The start of the pre­vi­ous en bloc cy­cle was in Q2 2016 when in­ven­tory fell to 23,300 units.”</p>
    <p>But much de­pends on the Govern­ment’s land sales pro­gramme, she adds: If it keeps up a steady sup­ply of land, it may ease the de­mand.</p>
    <p>In ed­u­ca­tion, the re­vised Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion scor­ing sys­tem kicks in this year. Pupils will be graded based on their ab­so­lute scores, not on how they fare rel­a­tive to oth­ers. So a pupil with 90 marks is given an Achieve­ment Level 1 score, just like the pupil with 98 marks.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, ev­ery mark at­tained af­fected a pupil’s rank rel­a­tive to his peers, and de­ter­mined the Ts­core used to al­lo­cate sec­ondary school choice.</p>
    <p>This led to com­pet­i­tive pres­sure</p>
    <p>to chase af­ter the next avail­able mark. The change in scor­ing will ease this pres­sure and have a trickle-down ef­fect on the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem cas­cad­ing down to pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>Home-based learn­ing will be­come a com­mon fea­ture of sec­ondary and ju­nior col­lege ed­u­ca­tion, tak­ing up at least two days a month from the third term this year.</p>
    <p>In trans­port, stage two of the Thom­son-East Coast Line, with six sta­tions from Springleaf to Calde­cott, which was due to open late last year, is ex­pected to fi­nally open in the third quar­ter of 2021.</p>
    <p>On the po­lit­i­cal front, ex­pect dis­cus­sions on race is­sues fol­low­ing the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion, and on gen­der equal­ity, with the tabling of a White Pa­per re­view­ing women’s is­sues.</p>
    <p>Suc­ces­sion re­mains an on­go­ing con­cern, with some anx­i­ety over whether Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong will step down this</p>
    <p>year, be­fore Fe­bru­ary next year, when he turns 70 – an age he had once sug­gested was too old for a prime min­is­ter. But with Covid-19 likely to dom­i­nate, a change of PM in 2021 looks un­likely.</p>
    <p>Long­stand­ing pri­or­i­ties of this Govern­ment will con­tinue to draw pol­icy at­ten­tion, in­clud­ing ef­forts on climate change and sus­tain­abil­ity, and so­cial pol­icy tweaks to re­duce in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>The key to a suc­cess­ful 2021 will be con­trol­ling Covid-19 while pre­par­ing for recovery in the post-Covid-19 world, and con­tin­u­ing with the on­go­ing jour­ney of trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>With Sin­ga­pore hailed in re­cent months as a model, gold stan­dard or some kind of bell­wether of Covid-19 man­age­ment, it is not only Sin­ga­pore­ans, but the world, ex­pect­ing this tiny city state to be first off the mark when the postCovid-19 recovery whis­tle blows.</p>
