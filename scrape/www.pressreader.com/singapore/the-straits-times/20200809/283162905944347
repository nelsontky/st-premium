    <p>The CCTV footage of a room in a Beirut home shows two chil­dren and a woman with a baby in her arms look­ing in dis­be­lief at some­thing out­side the win­dow.</p>
    <p>“Look at how that house is burn­ing,” says one of the two chil­dren. Sud­denly the glass win­dows through which they are look­ing shat­ter and fall on them.</p>
    <p>One child ex­tri­cates him­self from un­der a bro­ken glass panel while the woman tries to shield the other child and baby. They cower and stay like that for a few mo­ments be­fore gath­er­ing their wits and es­cap­ing from the now wrecked room.</p>
    <p>An­other video from a Beirut home shows a tod­dler wan­der­ing about on a ve­ran­dah while a do­mes­tic worker vac­u­ums the floor. An ex­plo­sion is heard and de­bris and dust fly in, cre­at­ing a mini tor­nado. The older woman, iden­ti­fied by some ne­ti­zens as an Ethiopian, drops the vac­uum, rushes to the tod­dler, scoops her up, and runs through a side door to safety.</p>
    <p>In an­other apart­ment, a pan­icked fa­ther pushes his son un­der a ta­ble as the flat shakes in the after­shock of the blast, and dust falls from the ceil­ing.</p>
    <p>Lucky, said ne­ti­zens over and over again as they shared these and other videos show­ing the cat­a­strophic mo­ment of the two blasts, the sec­ond dead­lier than the first.</p>
    <p>“This video of a fa­ther in #Beirut try­ing to com­fort and pro­tect his son from the blast moved me to tears, So sur­real and this is ex­tremely sad. Won­der­ful Dad,” tweeted Mo­hamed Ali Hayow from Kam­pala, Uganda.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens praised the pres­ence of mind and hero­ism of the adults try­ing to shield the young.</p>
    <p>Some Beirut res­i­dents also tweeted about their nar­row es­cape.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the mo­ment, Twit­ter user hori­zon @BMZH_ said: “We felt the ground shake, my dad opened the bal­cony door ex­pect­ing some type of earthquake, and we all got sent back sev­eral me­ters away nearly in­stantly. Lucky to be alive & safe, pray­ing for ev­ery­one else af­fected from the #Beirut ex­plo­sion. Stay safe”.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user Aimee Meade @AimeePaige said she was in­cred­i­bly lucky not to have been at home. “My apart­ment is about 300m from the blast and faces the port. Al­most ev­ery­thing I own has been dec­i­mated,” she said.</p>
    <p>Any num­ber of trig­ger warn­ings can­not cush­ion a viewer from the hor­rific fe­roc­ity of the blasts, which oc­curred as 2,750 tonnes of am­mo­nium ni­trate that had been stored un­safely at a ware­house in the port ex­ploded in a fire. Over 150 were killed and 5,000 in­jured – a toll that con­tin­ues to climb.</p>
    <p>The shaky videos emerg­ing online in­clude those taken by peo­ple who saw the smoke that fol­lowed the first ex­plo­sion and be­gan film­ing, and also those by peo­ple go­ing about their lives record­ing seem­ingly ev­ery­day ac­tiv­i­ties such as a church ser­vice or tak­ing wed­ding pho­tos. These show how un­sus­pect­ing they were about what was to fol­low.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the numb­ing mo­ments of a tragedy comes the busi­ness of pick­ing up, and Beirut res­i­dents are us­ing the hash­tag #OurHomesAr­eOpen to open up their homes to those left with­out a roof over their heads. Some 300,000 peo­ple are es­ti­mated to have be­come home­less, with their homes com­pletely de­stroyed or ren­dered struc­turally un­safe.</p>
    <p>Online plat­form ThawraMap, which usu­ally points out protest lo­ca­tions, is now mark­ing out ho­tels and homes of­fer­ing vic­tims a free bed or place to stay.</p>
    <p>In­sta­gram page Open­hous­es_le­banon is help­ing to match peo­ple in need of shel­ter with those who have a spare room. Some are go­ing be­yond homes, and of­fer­ing food.</p>
    <p>“My fam­ily and I would like to of­fer our house in Dbayeh to home­less peo­ple af­ter this tragedy. Please con­tact us,” says one In­sta­gram post.</p>
    <p>Con­stantly watch­ing vi­o­lent or graphic videos on so­cial me­dia can be dis­tress­ing and trau­matic. Tra­di­tional me­dia out­lets and large or­gan­i­sa­tion usu­ally put a warn­ing la­bel if they choose to share these. Face­book and Twit­ter have their own poli­cies on sen­si­tive con­tent.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, the shar­ing of con­tent about a tragedy is an act of shar­ing pain and serves to foster a spirit of com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The hero­ism and spirit of the res­i­dents of Beirut in the face of Tues­day’s tragedy, which comes on top of an eco­nomic cri­sis and amid a pan­demic, are in­spir­ing in­deed.</p>
    <p>MA­HATHIR JOINS TIKTOK</p>
    <p>Even as #TrumpAn­nounces BanOnTikTo­kAndWeChat be­gan trend­ing, former Malaysian prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad an­nounced he has joined TikTok.</p>
    <p>“Still Young,” says the 95-year-old’s pro­file.</p>
    <p>His first and only video so far cel­e­brates 64 years of mar­riage to his wife, Tun Dr Siti Has­mah Mo­hamad Ali, along with the cap­tion, “64 and still go­ing strong #LoveS­tory”.</p>
    <p>In the video, the cou­ple pose for a pho­to­graph stand­ing in the same po­si­tion as their younger selves in a black-and-white im­age. It was done for the TikTok “I’m just a kid” chal­lenge, which asks users to find an old photo of them­selves and their friends and then re­cre­ate the photo with the same peo­ple in present times and com­pare the two.</p>
    <p>Tun Dr Ma­hathir’s TikTok ac­count @chedetof­fi­cial has drawn at least 71,100 fol­low­ers and 216,300 likes since the video was posted on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>At 95, he is not the only se­nior cit­i­zen on TikTok.</p>
    <p>Even though the phrase, “OK Boomer” was pop­u­larised on the plat­form that is most pop­u­lar with young adults and teenagers, the older gen­er­a­tion has also been mak­ing their mark on it.</p>
    <p>Dubbed “Sil­ver TikTok­ers”, they are con­nect­ing with younger au­di­ences via short videos show­ing them try­ing out fun dances, shar­ing ex­er­cise rou­tines or prank­ing their chil­dren or grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>A ris­ing star on the Sin­ga­pore scene, for in­stance, is Mr Cedric Ng, 52, whose ac­count @dad­dyming has 586,700 fol­low­ers. “I love prank­ing my son,” says his pro­file.</p>
    <p>His son, na­tional taek­wondo ath­lete Ming Wei, is al­ready a pop­u­lar TikToker, and to­gether the duo show why team­ing up with some­one from an­other gen­er­a­tion works on so­cial me­dia – even if you are prank­ing each other.</p>
