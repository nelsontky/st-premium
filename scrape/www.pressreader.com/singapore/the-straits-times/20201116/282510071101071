    <p>• Bern­hard Langer has seen just about ev­ery­thing dur­ing his 37 years play­ing at the Masters but Satur­day pro­vided a first for some­one who has been fea­tur­ing here since be­fore most of this year’s com­peti­tors were even born.</p>
    <p>A unique Masters be­ing played largely in si­lence with­out spec­ta­tors means those few peo­ple on the Augusta Na­tional premises need to be more ob­ser­vant than usual to stay out of the way, with­out any gallery noise to pro­vide audi­ble cues.</p>
    <p>Two-time Masters cham­pion Langer and his play­ing com­pan­ions were on the eighth tee when one obliv­i­ous vol­un­teer am­bled across the fair­way barely 100 yards away.</p>
    <p>Never mind that the Ger­man’s bright or­ange slacks could al­most be vis­i­ble from outer space, the man did not so much as glance to his left.</p>
    <p>With­out miss­ing a beat, Langer smacked his drive di­rectly over the man’s head, and only then al­lowed his famed con­cen­tra­tion to be in­ter­rupted.</p>
    <p>“Good morn­ing,” the 63-yearold yelled with more than a hint of sar­casm in his voice. “Wake up.”</p>
    <p>The man, suit­ably ad­mon­ished, then broke into a trot for the last few yards of his traverse across the fair­way, though his ges­ture to make amends was too late to make any dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Langer’s drive at that hole trav­elled all of 250 yards, 70 yards shorter than that of Ul­ster­man Rory McIl­roy, his play­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing be­come the old­est player ever to make the half­way cut at the Masters, he man­aged a re­spectable one-over 73 for a to­tal two-un­der 214, 14 shots be­hind third-round leader and world No. 1 Dustin John­son, be­fore speak­ing about the in­ci­dent at the eighth.</p>
    <p>“I tee it up, and I can see him com­ing,” Langer said. “He’s al­ready 10 yards into the fair­way and I’m think­ing, ‘Well, should I stop now?’</p>
    <p>“I just fig­ure, what the heck, I’ll just hit it over the top of him. He wasn’t in dan­ger, but he was clearly in my view, let’s put it that way. You don’t see that very of­ten that peo­ple are walk­ing some­where across the fair­way.”</p>
    <p>Later, a 60-foot putt at the parthree 16th that dived into the cup for an un­likely birdie prompted Langer to burst out laugh­ing at the im­prob­a­bil­ity of it all.</p>
    <p>“It was go­ing like a train,” he said. “I got a mini-cheer from the 121/</p>
    <p>2 peo­ple walk­ing with us.”</p>
    <p>Just be­ing around for the week­end is im­prob­a­ble enough for the 1985 and 1993 cham­pion, who even in his hey­day was not a par­tic­u­larly long hit­ter.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think the course has ever played this long,” Langer said, re­fer­ring to the lack of roll in the fair­ways due to the rain ear­lier in the week.</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally wet, and I don’t re­mem­ber hit­ting three-woods into so many par-fours.”</p>
    <p>John­son’s to­tal of 16-un­der 200 tied fel­low Amer­i­can Jor­dan Spi­eth for the best 54-hole course record, with Masters debu­tants Im Sung-jae (68) of South Korea and Mex­i­can Abra­ham Ancer (69), as well as Aus­tralia’s Cameron Smith (69) trail­ing by four strokes go­ing into the fi­nal round yes­ter­day.</p>
