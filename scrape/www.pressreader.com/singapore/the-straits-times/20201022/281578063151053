    <p>The cen­tre­piece of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ ef­forts to up­lift low-wage work­ers is its Pro­gres­sive Wage Model, while the Work­ers’ Party calls for a min­i­mum wage of $1,300 each month. As­sis­tant news edi­tor Toh Yong Chuan (be­low) looks at the dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>The de­bate in Par­lia­ment last week saw the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Work­ers’ Party (WP) cross­ing swords on the is­sue of min­i­mum wage for work­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It was not the first time the po­lar­is­ing is­sue came up for de­bate in the House, and it is un­likely to be the last.</p>
    <p>But even as the spar­ring threw up some new ar­gu­ments, it also mag­ni­fied the ide­o­log­i­cal dif­fer­ences be­tween the gov­ern­ment-backed NTUC and WP, which has 10 of the 93 elected con­stituency MPs in the House.</p>
    <p>It is timely to ex­am­ine how the de­bate has added to un­der­stand­ing gov­ern­ment ef­forts to lift the in­comes of low-wage work­ers, and to as­sess the im­pact of the NTUC-WP rift.</p>
    <p>WP’S PRO­POSED $1,300 NA­TIONAL MIN­I­MUM MONTHLY WAGE</p>
    <p>The de­bate cen­tred on whether full-time Sin­ga­porean work­ers should be paid a min­i­mum of $1,300 each month.</p>
    <p>This fig­ure is sig­nif­i­cant be­cause it was a key pol­icy pro­posal by the WP dur­ing the gen­eral elec­tion this year. The WP did not pluck the fig­ure out of the air.</p>
    <p>Since there is no leg­is­lated min­i­mum wage in Sin­ga­pore, the party has, since GE2015, used the av­er­age house­hold ex­pen­di­ture on ba­sic needs for a four-per­son house­hold as a proxy for min­i­mum wage. The fig­ure is an es­ti­mate of the av­er­age monthly sum that house­holds spend on es­sen­tial needs such as food, cloth­ing and shel­ter.</p>
    <p>It is not pub­lished rou­tinely by the Gov­ern­ment, but WP MPs have raised par­lia­men­tary ques­tions to ob­tain it.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures were $1,250 in 2011 and $1,300 in 2017. WP promptly used them as rec­om­mended min­i­mum wages in its GE2015 and GE2020 man­i­festos.</p>
    <p>SOME 32,000 FULL-TIME</p>
    <p>LO­CAL WORK­ERS EARN</p>
    <p>LESS THAN $1,300 EACH MONTH</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to WP’s pro­posal – flagged by party chief and Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh in a Face­book post on Oct 12 – deputy labour chief Koh Poh Koon re­vealed that about 32,000 full-time work­ers in Sin­ga­pore take home less than $1,300 each month.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure, which was dis­closed for the first time, drew two po­lar­is­ing views.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh said that 32,000 “is a very small num­ber”, which is about</p>
    <p>1.7 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s lo­cal work­force.</p>
    <p>But Mr Singh coun­tered: “It is not a small num­ber, it is a large num­ber.”</p>
    <p>This re­flects a dif­fer­ence in per­spec­tives be­tween the WP and the labour move­ment on low-wage work­ers in Sin­ga­pore, and how they should be helped.</p>
    <p>PRO­GRES­SIVE WAGE MODEL VER­SUS MIN­I­MUM WAGE</p>
    <p>The cen­tre­piece of NTUC’s ef­forts to up­lift low-wage work­ers is its pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM).</p>
    <p>The model was un­veiled by then labour chief Lim Swee Say on</p>
    <p>June 21, 2012, at a clean­ing in­dus­try fo­rum as a wage and skills lad­der where work­ers can earn higher salaries as they up­grade their skills.</p>
    <p>Its aim was to raise the pay of 10,000 lo­cal clean­ers to $1,000 a month by 2015. At that time, there were some 50,000 Sin­ga­porean clean­ers and their mean monthly gross pay was $815 in 2011.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim made a heartfelt plea to em­ploy­ers at the fo­rum. The move would help to dis­pel the no­tion that clean­ing jobs were dead-end jobs, he said, adding that he was against the idea of a min­i­mum wage.</p>
    <p>“The con­cept of min­i­mum wage is some­thing that we don’t em­brace,” he told re­porters then.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim’s views re­flected the labour move­ment’s long-held be­lief that a leg­is­lated na­tional min­i­mum wage does not work: Set­ting it too low will not help lift the pay of low-wage work­ers, and set­ting it too high will make low-wage work­ers un­em­ploy­able be­cause com­pa­nies will not hire them.</p>
    <p>Given NTUC’s sym­bi­otic re­la­tion­ship with the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP), the PWM be­came both NTUC and PAP’s an­swer to a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage.</p>
    <p>Over time, it also be­came part of a broader gov­ern­ment strat­egy to help low-wage work­ers, to­gether with schemes like the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment (WIS).</p>
    <p>“The pro­gres­sive wage model is work­ing. It is bet­ter than a min­i­mum wage, which is only the first step. It is a lad­der of skills and wages that helps our low-in­come work­ers move up,” said Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam in July this year.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said in his min­is­te­rial state­ment that the PWM is “an im­por­tant labour pol­icy in­no­va­tion” and “more than a sec­tor-based min­i­mum wage”.</p>
    <p>“It is a four-in-one frame­work com­pris­ing a job lad­der, skills lad­der, pro­duc­tiv­ity lad­der and wage lad­der. These four up­grad­ing lad­ders are mu­tu­ally re­in­forc­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>The clean­ing sec­tor im­ple­mented the PWM in 2014, fol­lowed by the se­cu­rity and land­scap­ing sec­tors in 2016.</p>
    <p>It is com­pul­sory for com­pa­nies in these sec­tors to adopt the model as part of their li­cens­ing and regis­tra­tion con­di­tions. The cur­rent ba­sic wage floor is $1,236 for an in­door cleaner, $1,250 for a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer and $1,450 for a land­scape worker.</p>
    <p>The PWM is ex­pected to take ef­fect in the lifts and es­ca­la­tor main­te­nance sec­tor in 2022.</p>
    <p>LIFT­ING THE IN­COMES OF LOW-WAGE WORK­ERS</p>
    <p>Over the years, the Gov­ern­ment and NTUC have pro­vided re­port cards on how their ef­forts have fared.</p>
    <p>In July, Mr Thar­man said low-wage work­ers in the 20th per­centile of the in­come lad­der have seen an in­crease in wages of close to 40 per cent in real terms over the last 10 years.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment last week, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad said that the in­comes of Sin­ga­pore’s work­ers at the 10th per­centile in­creased by more than 50 per cent over the past decade, from $1,000 in 2009 to $1,517 last year.</p>
    <p>He added that real in­comes have in­creased by around 30 per cent in the three sec­tors where the PWM has been im­ple­mented, out­pac­ing the real in­come growth of 21 per cent at the me­dian for all sec­tors.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt that the PWM has worked.</p>
    <p>But a deeper anal­y­sis re­veals at least three weak­nesses.</p>
    <p>SLOW IM­PLE­MEN­TA­TION</p>
    <p>One, the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the model has been painfully slow.</p>
    <p>Af­ter eight years, NTUC has rolled out the model in three sec­tors, with one more to fol­low in 2022.</p>
    <p>More sig­nif­i­cantly, NTUC has missed its tar­get in rolling out the wage model. Mr Lim told The Straits Times in an in­ter­view pub­lished on June 30, 2012: “We will con­tinue to iden­tify more clean­ing jobs and other sec­tors. Our to­tal tar­get is to help 100,000 low-wage work­ers by 2015.”</p>
    <p>But last week, Dr Koh said: “The PWM has lifted the wages of close to 80,000 clean­ers, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers and land­scape work­ers.”</p>
    <p>Even if one adds the 2,100 lift tech­ni­cians to the fold, among whom some 42 per cent are Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, the num­ber still falls short of the 100,000 tar­get.</p>
    <p>Two, there is talk of bus driv­ers, waste man­age­ment work­ers and re­tail work­ers com­ing un­der the</p>
    <p>PWM’s fold, but there are no con­crete de­tails or time­lines.</p>
    <p>Three, even though the in­comes of low-wage work­ers have risen sig­nif­i­cantly in the last decade, they have to be seen in the con­text that their in­comes stag­nated in the decade be­fore that.</p>
    <p>The nom­i­nal monthly in­come at the bot­tom-fifth rose from $1,200 in 2001 to $1,400 in 2010. And af­ter ad­just­ing for in­fla­tion, this worked out to real growth of just 0.3 per cent over the decade – al­most 0 per cent a year.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S NEXT?</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the House de­bate, the WP did not pro­vide ro­bust em­pir­i­cal data to back up its ar­gu­ments to im­ple­ment a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage, but it struck a peace­able tone.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh did not tear down the PWM. In­stead, he ac­knowl­edged that gov­ern­ment poli­cies, par­tic­u­larly the PWM and WIS, have en­sured that the ma­jor­ity of low-wage work­ers take home more than $1,300 a month.</p>
    <p>WP’s Mr Leon Per­era also asked whether a min­i­mum wage could be im­ple­mented to help the 32,000 work­ers while PWM takes its time to be rolled out.</p>
    <p>On NTUC’s part, Dr Koh also noted that it is “not ide­o­log­i­cally against a min­i­mum wage”.</p>
    <p>“In fact, the first rung of the wage lad­der in the PWM is a form of sec­toral min­i­mum wage,” he said, adding: “We share the same ob­jec­tive to up­lift the in­comes of low-wage work­ers. Where we dif­fer, though, is the ap­proach to getting there.”</p>
    <p>The seem­ing pos­si­bil­ity of find­ing a com­mon ground was re­fresh­ing.</p>
    <p>But given NTUC’s in­ti­mate re­la­tion­ship with the PAP, and with the PAP and WP com­pet­ing for po­lit­i­cal power, it is un­likely that NTUC and WP will find any com­mon pol­icy ground.</p>
    <p>TWO PRESS­ING TASKS FOR NTUC</p>
    <p>NTUC has two press­ing tasks.</p>
    <p>One, it has to pro­vide a clear timetable on how it in­tends to roll out the PWM in the var­i­ous sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Two, now that we know there are some 32,000 lo­cal work­ers earn­ing less than $1,300 each month, there must be a con­crete plan to lift their wages.</p>
    <p>This is part of NTUC’s pub­licly stated ob­jec­tive “to help work­ers of all... ages and na­tion­al­i­ties achieve gain­ful employment through bet­ter jobs, and a bet­ter liv­ing through higher wages so they can live a bet­ter life”.</p>
    <p>Say­ing that the work­ers form</p>
    <p>1.7 per cent of the lo­cal labour force does not cut it. These are work­ers in our midst and their well-be­ing, and that of their fam­i­lies, is at stake.</p>
    <p>Anec­do­tally, we know where to find these work­ers: They are the cof­fee shop run­ners, petrol pump un­cles and Hous­ing Board neigh­bour­hood shop as­sis­tants.</p>
    <p>But more re­search and data on these work­ers who are not cov­ered by the PWM will be use­ful to fig­ure out how to help them.</p>
    <p>If NTUC does not speed up the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the PWM or raise the wages of these 32,000 work­ers, the call to up­lift them us­ing a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage will only grow stronger.</p>
