    <p>Long queues formed at Mar­sil­ing Com­mu­nity Club yes­ter­day as na­tional dis­tri­bu­tion of TraceTo­gether to­kens re­sumed in a limited fash­ion.</p>
    <p>Mar­sil­ing is the first com­mu­nity cen­tre where to­kens are avail­able again, af­ter dis­tri­bu­tion was halted on Wed­nes­day by the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group (SNDGG).</p>
    <p>New col­lec­tion venues will be opened one con­stituency at a time fol­low­ing re­ports of long queues at some com­mu­nity cen­tres/clubs (CCs) last week­end.</p>
    <p>There were al­ready about 100 peo­ple in the queue when The Straits Times vis­ited the Mar­sil­ing CC at 9.45am yes­ter­day. Crowds con­tin­ued to pour in even at 11.30am.</p>
    <p>Five coun­ters were set up in a hall, with one set aside for the el­derly and phys­i­cally in­firm. The wait­ing time for col­lec­tion ranged from 30 min­utes to an hour.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral peo­ple thought they had only one day to col­lect the to­kens.</p>
    <p>“I came to­day be­cause I read the (To­kenGoWhere) web­site wrongly and thought the date listed was the only date,” said a res­i­dent, who wanted to be known only as Madam Tan. “If I had known, I might have come an­other day.”</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Is­mail Ibrahim, 57, waited for around 45 min­utes to col­lect four to­kens for him­self and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“To­day is the first day (of col­lec­tion) so peo­ple are go­ing to come down,” said the Mar­sil­ing res­i­dent, who prefers the TraceTo­gether to­ken to the app as he is try­ing to cut down his phone us­age.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Ve­laitham Pil­lai, 78, also queued for 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“I could have come on an­other day when there were not so many peo­ple but I just wanted to col­lect (the to­ken) early,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 107 CCs in other con­stituen­cies will be pro­gres­sively opened for to­ken col­lec­tion be­tween this month and De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The sched­ule is avail­able on the To­ken Go Where web­site at https://to­ken.gowhere.gov.sg/</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tion at all CCs will con­tinue un­til the end of the year, and is not limited to one day.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents have also been told that they should col­lect to­kens only from the CC in the con­stituency where they live.</p>
    <p>This means that Ma­rine Pa­rade res­i­dents, for ex­am­ple, can get their hands on a to­ken only from Dec 14.</p>
    <p>To­ken dis­tri­bu­tion ini­tially kicked off last month, and had been ex­panded to 38 CCs be­fore Wed­nes­day’s halt.</p>
    <p>An SNDGG spokesman said the changes to its dis­tri­bu­tion plan were to “pre­vent l ong queues from de­vel­op­ing by res­i­dents from dif­fer­ent parts of Sin­ga­pore com­ing to the same col­lec­tion points”.</p>
    <p>“TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try will be en­forced only when ev­ery­one who needs a to­ken is able to col­lect one at a CC near them,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>“All CCs will be dis­tribut­ing to­kens by the se­cond half of De­cem­ber, so res­i­dents need not rush to col­lect their to­kens.”</p>
