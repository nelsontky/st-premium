    <p>This year’s Twenty20 World Cup, which Aus­tralia was sched­uled to host from Oct 18 un­til Nov 15, has been post­poned be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the In­ter­na­tional Cricket Coun­cil (ICC) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“At to­day’s meet­ing... win­dows for the next three ICC men’s events were also agreed to bring clar­ity to the cal­en­dar and give the sport the best pos­si­ble op­por­tu­nity,” the sport’s gov­ern­ing body an­nounced af­ter a meet­ing of its com­mer­cial sub­sidiary IBC.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ingly, there will be backto-back men’s T20 World Cups next year and in 2022 be­fore the 50-overs World Cup in In­dia in 2023.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sion... was taken af­ter care­ful con­sid­er­a­tion of all of the op­tions avail­able to us and gives us the best pos­si­ble op­por­tu­nity of de­liv­er­ing two safe and suc­cess­ful T20 World Cups for fans around the world,” ICC chief ex­ec­u­tive Manu Sawh­ney said.</p>
    <p>“Our mem­bers now have the clar­ity they need around event win­dows to en­able them to resched­ule lost bi­lat­eral and do­mes­tic cricket,” he added.</p>
    <p>The ICC added it would also con­tinue to eval­u­ate the sit­u­a­tion ahead of the women’s World Cup in New Zealand, cur­rently sched­uled for Feb 6 to March 7 next year.</p>
    <p>While no new date has been an­nounced, the de­lay of the T20</p>
    <p>World Cup does free up a pos­si­ble win­dow for the start of the In­dian Premier League, with the new sea­son yet to get un­der way ow­ing to the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>With In­dia record­ing over 1.13 mil­lion cases and over 27,000 deaths till yes­ter­day, the author­i­ties have been un­able to say when the com­pe­ti­tion can com­mence safely. But it now ap­pears that a late Oc­to­ber to mid-Novem­ber slot may be pos­si­ble, co­in­cid­ing with the end of the mon­soon sea­son.</p>
