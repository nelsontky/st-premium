ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW Since the first race for space began in the mid-1900s, seven nations or political unions have been to or orbited the Moon so far as part of a successful or semi-successful mission. The United States and the Soviet Union competed for supremacy in a space race in the 1960s and 1970s, during which they too brought back lunar samples, but that was a different era. China is now in the fray, with a broader goal of establishi­ng a lunar base that could exploit the Moon's potential resources and serve as a launching pad for more ambitious missions.
The country stepped up its space programme in the 2000s and flew its first mission of the Chang’e programme in 2007. China's Chang’e-5 spacecraft has returned from the moon, gathering as much as 2kg worth of lunar samples with it, in the country's most successful mission to date. Clara Chong explores the spacecraft's return mission. RETURN MISSION Ascender docks with the orbiter-returner in orbit. Sample is transferre­d to the returner. 2 Returner separates from orbiter. 3 Solar arrays unfold. 1 Once the sample is collected, the ascender lifts off. Lunar sample-return missions
United States (1969-1972) The Apollo programme collected 382kg of lunar samples. 4 Returner lands in Inner Mongolia. Soviet Union
1976: The Luna 24 mission collected a 170g sample from the Mare Crisium region. Chang’e-5 on Moon CHANG’E-5
Chang’e-5 spacecraft landed on Dec 1 in the north-west region of Oceanus Procellaru­m, also known as the Ocean of Storms, on the near side of the Moon. TIMELINE Dec 1
Probe successful­ly lands on Moon GOAL
Rock and soil samples will help give insights into the Moon’s: Origins Formation Volcanic activity Dec 3
Probe leaves Moon to return to Earth Samples
• 2kg collected and stored inside a sealed container in the spacecraft . Dec 17 Return of capsule to Earth Drill
• The probe drilled a 2m-deep hole to gather specimens. Robotic arm
• Within 48 hours, a robotic arm scooped up rocks and regolith – the soil layer on the lunar surface. Sources: AFP, SPACEFLIGH­T NOW, CGTN, SCMP STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS: LEE HUP KHENG, LIM KAILI
