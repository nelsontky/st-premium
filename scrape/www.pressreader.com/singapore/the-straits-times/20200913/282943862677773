    <p>About 80 per cent of the 1,000 new grad­u­ates of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) Business School have al­ready found jobs even though they joined the work­force dur­ing the worst re­ces­sion to hit Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, the top five sec­tors where th­ese stu­dents land jobs are: bank­ing and fi­nance, ac­coun­tancy, tech­nol­ogy, con­sult­ing, and re­tail that deals with fast-mov­ing con­sumer goods.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, dur­ing bet­ter times, the fig­ure would be 96 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the Grad­u­ate Em­ploy­ment Survey 2019 by the Min­istry of Education.</p>
    <p>In th­ese cases, em­ploy­ment cov­ers full-time, part-time, tem­po­rary and free­lance jobs.</p>
    <p>That the ma­jor­ity of the newly minted fi­nan­cial ex­ec­u­tives of Class 2020 – the bulk of whom are Sin­ga­pore­ans – were hired soon af­ter they grad­u­ated in July shows that there is high de­mand for such Sin­ga­pore-trained tal­ent.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor of fi­nance Jo­han Su­lae­man, who is an aca­demic di­rec­tor of NUS Business School, notes that it is cer­tainly not true that Sin­ga­pore does not pro­duce good fi­nan­cial tal­ent.</p>
    <p>“Rather, the num­ber may not be enough to ful­fil the needs of the grow­ing fi­nan­cial sec­tor. For in­stance, if em­ploy­ers are look­ing for those with pro­gram­ming skills, the NUS School of Com­put­ing has an ex­cel­lent un­der­grad­u­ate pro­gramme,” he says.</p>
    <p>The NUS Business School and the School of Com­put­ing have a joint Master of Sci­ence in Business An­a­lyt­ics pro­gramme, which com­bines the com­ple­men­tary ex­per­tise of both schools.</p>
    <p>Prof Jo­han’s com­ment comes in the wake of the con­tro­versy in­volv­ing 47 em­ploy­ers who al­legedly pre­ferred to hire for­eign­ers in­stead of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Among th­ese firms, 30 were in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices and pro­fes­sional ser­vices sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Mal­prac­tice aside, if an em­ployer chooses not to hire some­one, it is usu­ally be­cause he feels that the can­di­date is not good enough for the job.</p>
    <p>So does the NUS Business School think its grad­u­ates are suf­fi­ciently trained to do all kinds of jobs in a fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion?</p>
    <p>Prof Jo­han be­lieves so, not­ing that if th­ese com­pa­nies are look­ing for ex­ec­u­tives with tra­di­tional fi­nance skills com­bined with re­source­ful­ness and crit­i­cal think­ing, the school’s stu­dents “have it cov­ered in spades”.</p>
    <p>“Our stu­dents also have the quan­ti­ta­tive and an­a­lyt­i­cal skills nec­es­sary to develop and im­ple­ment so­lu­tions in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor,” he says.</p>
    <p>While business stu­dents may not be as well versed in IT skills, they have a broader set of skills that will al­low them to un­der­stand not only the tech­nol­ogy that is in­volved, but also how it can be used for business and strate­gic de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>That’s not all. The stu­dents also get to prove their met­tle in the field.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, a team of four NUS Master’s in Fi­nance stu­dents beat six other lo­cal teams to win the 2020 Ex­pe­ri­ence Gold­man Sachs com­pe­ti­tion, which re­quired them to craft a per­sonal in­vest­ment plan and come up with a stock-pick­ing strat­egy, based on two con­fi­den­tial cases, that were pre­sented to and judged by Gold­man Sachs ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>Other stu­dents also work with banks here, such as OCBC Bank and Citibank, so that they can put their knowl­edge to use on ac­tual cases.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, at OCBC, some stu­dents came up with a pro­posal on how own­ers of smaller busi­nesses can use dig­i­tal bank­ing to get things done bet­ter.</p>
    <p>With such com­pre­hen­sive train­ing, it is no won­der that many of the school’s past stu­dents end up hold­ing top fi­nan­cial jobs here.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Mr Peter Seah, chair­man of DBS Bank; Mr Ron­ald Ong, chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive (South-east Asia) of Mor­gan Stan­ley; Mr Bahren Shaari, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Bank of Sin­ga­pore; and Mr Thio Boon Kiat, chief ex­ec­u­tive of UOB As­set Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>While the younger gen­er­a­tion of fi­nan­cial ex­ec­u­tives is qual­i­fied for most jobs, young ex­ec­u­tives must also have a good work­ing at­ti­tude and mind­set, which are the ba­sic needs for any job.</p>
    <p>That the con­tro­versy was even de­bated in Par­lia­ment does not guar­an­tee a shoo-in for Sin­ga­pore­ans for all jobs on ac­count of their cit­i­zen­ship – they must still show that they are the best tal­ent for the roles.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, there is noth­ing stop­ping own­ers of com­pa­nies from freez­ing hir­ing or farm­ing out jobs to work­ers based in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has made many com­pa­nies re­alise that many jobs can be done re­motely, and this means that they can con­tinue to hire for­eign­ers with­out even re­quir­ing them to be here.</p>
    <p>Mr Sean Mah, who holds a first­class hon­ours de­gree in ac­coun­tancy from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, be­lieves that it pays for Sin­ga­pore­ans to be aware that com­pe­ti­tion for jobs can come not only from over­seas, but also that work is no longer con­fined to Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders and time zone.</p>
    <p>Un­like many of his peers, the for­mer au­di­tor, 38, is his own boss – he co-founded As­tral As­set Man­age­ment, which han­dles a fund of over $22 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“Good bank­ing pro­fes­sion­als must be will­ing to go the ex­tra mile for their cus­tomers. This of­ten en­tails work­ing at un­earthly hours to cover cap­i­tal mar­kets like Ja­pan and Aus­tralia, or US trad­ing hours. Some must work on week­ends for months to en­sure IT plat­forms can tran­si­tion smoothly with­out im­pact­ing the day-to-day con­sumer bank­ing op­er­a­tions,” he says.</p>
    <p>An­other key qual­ity is to be able to com­mu­ni­cate ef­fec­tively, some­times in for­eign lan­guages, and col­lab­o­rate with col­leagues from over­seas to get projects in multi-time zones done.</p>
    <p>Some high-pay­ing jobs re­quire a will­ing­ness to travel fre­quently at short no­tice and re­lo­cate over­seas to take on com­plex projects.</p>
    <p>So the mil­lion-dol­lar ques­tion for Sin­ga­pore­ans is: Are they will­ing to do what their for­eign coun­ter­parts have done – up­root and work in a for­eign coun­try while leav­ing most of their loved ones be­hind?</p>
    <p>When it comes to how the lo­cal work­force is per­ceived, Mr Mah says Sin­ga­pore­ans are in a good po­si­tion, not­ing that he has come across many pos­i­tive com­ments from for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore ex­ec­u­tives are usu­ally per­ceived to be trust­wor­thy, hon­est and hard-work­ing. They have the abil­ity to un­der­stand and ex­e­cute tasks well.”</p>
    <p>But they need to work on their street savvi­ness, such as not be­ing too di­rect or frank when work­ing in a multi­na­tional en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Also, once they do well, many tend to keep to their com­fort zones and are averse to tak­ing risks.</p>
    <p>“Some like to be low-pro­file and spend less time so­cial­is­ing. Networking helps one to be alert to industry trends and, more im­por­tantly, an industry net­work is use­ful when one is sud­denly re­trenched,” he says.</p>
    <p>On the hir­ing con­tro­versy, Mr Mah shares the views of most Sin­ga­pore­ans that the choice of em­ploy­ees must be based on the na­tional ethos of mer­i­toc­racy.</p>
    <p>So this means that un­less the em­ployer owns a con­trol­ling stake, which makes his com­pany a fam­ily business, it should be the best per­son for the job – Sin­ga­porean or oth­er­wise – and that per­sonal back­ground, re­la­tion­ship and friend­ship should never be the main con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“The hir­ing cri­te­ria and process should be trans­par­ent. Mul­ti­ple in­ter­view­ers should be de­ployed and a panel of in­ter­view­ers should be used rather than a sole hir­ing man­ager to make the fi­nal de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“The com­pany should have a whis­tle-blow­ing pol­icy in place if other em­ploy­ees sus­pect there is nepo­tism,” Mr Mah says.</p>
    <p>Does the NUS Business School think its grad­u­ates are suf­fi­ciently trained to do all kinds of jobs in a fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion? As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Jo­han Su­lae­man be­lieves so, not­ing that if th­ese com­pa­nies are look­ing for ex­ec­u­tives with tra­di­tional fi­nance skills com­bined with re­source­ful­ness and crit­i­cal think­ing, the school’s stu­dents “have it cov­ered in spades”.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Jo­han Su­lae­man notes that Sin­ga­pore does pro­duce good fi­nan­cial tal­ent.</p>
