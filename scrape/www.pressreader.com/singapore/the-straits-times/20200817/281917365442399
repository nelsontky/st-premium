    <p>The path to nor­mal­i­sa­tion of re­la­tions be­tween Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE), bro­kered with the help of the United States, is clearly a for­eign pol­icy win for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who is seek­ing re-elec­tion in Novem­ber. He has reg­is­tered the con­tin­u­ing in­flu­ence in the re­gion’s af­fairs by the US, which helped pro­duce the 1978 Camp David Ac­cords be­tween Is­rael and Egypt that led to a peace treaty be­tween them, and the 1994 peace treaty be­tween Is­rael and Jor­dan. But while last week’s sur­prise an­nounce­ment may have re­vived the process of po­lit­i­cal re­align­ment in the Mid­dle East, which lay largely in a state of sus­pended an­i­ma­tion, it also threat­ens to widen ex­ist­ing fis­sures in a still-volatile re­gion.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can in­ter­ests in the strate­gi­cally cru­cial Mid­dle East rest on man­ag­ing and rec­on­cil­ing the in­ter­ests of its al­lies – a task com­pli­cated im­mensely by the his­tor­i­cal Arab-Is­raeli di­vide re­volv­ing round the Pales­tinian ques­tion. For Is­rael, the ex­pand­ing sphere of Arab na­tions that are will­ing to treat it as an in­trin­sic and nor­mal part of the re­gion is an in­valu­able diplo­matic gain. There are ex­pec­ta­tions that other play­ers – Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Ara­bia – might be at­tracted to fol­low the UAE, Jor­dan and Egypt on the path to bet­ter re­la­tions with Is­rael. For the UAE, the deal rep­re­sents a mo­ment of truth in the mostly Sunni na­tion’s deal­ings with Shi’ite Iran at a time when Teheran has made deep strate­gic in­roads i nto the Mid­dle East. The eco­nomic prospects are not in­signif­i­cant for the UAE, ei­ther, given the boost that could be pro­vided by the mar­riage of Emi­rati fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal with Is­raeli tech­no­log­i­cal prow­ess on the agri­cul­tural, health­care and cy­ber fronts. If oth­ers join that un­fold­ing en­ter­prise, it could al­ter the re­gion’s eco­nomic map com­men­su­rate with its po­lit­i­cal re­fash­ion­ing.</p>
    <p>Pales­tini­ans are un­happy at the way in which the lat­est devel­op­ment could cut the diplo­matic ground from un­der their feet. They be­lieve, rightly, that they will lose re­gional lever­age on Is­rael should more Arab na­tions make peace with the Jewish state. There is a sliver of hope on the Pales­tinian hori­zon, how­ever. Is­rael said it will sus­pend its planned an­nex­a­tion of ar­eas in the oc­cu­pied West Bank – al­though there is no with­drawal. The UAE re­mains com­mit­ted to its sup­port of Pales­tini­ans, who hope to cre­ate an in­de­pen­dent state in the oc­cu­pied West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Abu Dhabi also ar­gues that its agree­ment main­tains the vi­a­bil­ity of a two-state so­lu­tion to the Is­raeli-Pales­tinian con­flict. It falls now on the UAE to hold Is­rael to its word on an­nex­a­tion, and to use its new­found diplo­matic re­la­tion­ship to fur­ther the Pales­tinian cause. While oth­ers may fol­low the UAE’s path, a last­ing peace in the re­gion can be achieved only with the es­tab­lish­ment of an in­de­pen­dent Pales­tinian state ex­ist­ing side by side in peace and se­cu­rity with Is­rael.</p>
