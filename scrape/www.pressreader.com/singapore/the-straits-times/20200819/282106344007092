    <p>A prom­i­nent Sikh com­mu­nity leader and pi­o­neer in the nurs­ing field in Sin­ga­pore, who was also well known in the foot­ball fra­ter­nity, died on Mon­day after a bout of ill health. He was 81.</p>
    <p>Mr Jagjit Singh Sekhon, who was raised in a vil­lage in Po­tong Pasir where he helped to take the cat­tle owned by his fam­ily for graz­ing, grew up to be­come a ded­i­cated health­care worker who led a nurses’ strike and fought for better work­ing con­di­tions for them in the 1960s.</p>
    <p>He later founded Sin­ga­pore’s first pro­fes­sion­ally op­er­ated nurs­ing home and es­tab­lished an am­bu­lance ser­vice op­er­ated by nurses in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>In later years, he weighed in on the im­pact of his early ac­tivism, say­ing in a 2015 in­ter­view: “I think the strike could have fin­ished me off. The me­dia was quite ruth­less and the Gov­ern­ment could have put me be­hind bars. ‘Home’ could have been Changi or St John’s Is­land. How­ever, I am glad that the Gov­ern­ment en­gaged us fairly.”</p>
    <p>Re­garded as a lo­cal com­mu­nity hero and known by many sim­ply as “JJ”, Mr Jagjit served in many roles, in­clud­ing as chair­man of the Sikh Wel­fare Coun­cil and pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Khalsa As­so­ci­a­tion (SKA). He was also well known in the foot­ball fra­ter­nity.</p>
    <p>Mr Hernaikh Singh, cur­rent pres­i­dent of the SKA, re­called how he was drawn by Mr Jagjit’s en­thu­si­asm and pas­sion to join the as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“He fo­cused on youth and sports, en­cour­ag­ing young peo­ple to par­tic­i­pate in com­mu­nity ser­vice projects and estab­lish­ing the youth ex­cel­lence in sports pro­gramme. As a per­son, he had a very forth­com­ing and giv­ing na­ture. It is a trait that ran in his fam­ily as both his broth­ers served the com­mu­nity as well,” said Mr Hernaikh.</p>
    <p>Mr Jagjit also left his mark on the Sin­ga­pore foot­ball scene as he was a former chair­man of the S-League, since re­branded as AIA Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL).</p>
    <p>In a tribute posted on Face­book on Mon­day, SPL said he would be re­mem­bered for his nu­mer­ous con­tri­bu­tions to foot­ball as well as to var­i­ous char­i­ta­ble so­cial causes.</p>
    <p>Mr Hernaikh re­called that Mr Jagjit would per­son­ally ap­proach those in need.</p>
    <p>“If some­one needed a job, he would help them find one, or if some­one was sick, he would send an am­bu­lance to take them to treat­ment. If some­one was im­mo­bile, he would send a bed for them to their home, of­ten free of charge. He has per­son­ally touched so many lives in his life­time,” said Mr Hernaikh, adding that Mr Jagjit leaves a wife and two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>He fo­cused on youth and sports, en­cour­ag­ing young peo­ple to par­tic­i­pate in com­mu­nity ser­vice projects and estab­lish­ing the youth ex­cel­lence in sports pro­gramme. As a per­son, he had a very forth­com­ing and giv­ing na­ture. It is a trait that ran in his fam­ily as both his broth­ers served the com­mu­nity as well. ’’ MR HERNAIKH SINGH, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Khalsa As­so­ci­a­tion, on Mr Jagjit Singh Sekhon, who pre­vi­ously served as the as­so­ci­a­tion’s pres­i­dent and was also well known in the foot­ball fra­ter­nity.</p>
