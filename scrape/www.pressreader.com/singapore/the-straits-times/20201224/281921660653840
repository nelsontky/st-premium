    <p>Cities, you may have heard, are toast. The ar­gu­ment is straight­for­ward and seem­ingly in­con­testable: The coro­n­avirus thrives among close clus­ters of hu­man be­ings, and nowhere are hu­mans clus­tered closer than in big cities. The virus’ toll seems to make the con­nec­tion plain. New York City, the most pop­u­lous and most dense ur­ban area in the United States, was also the first to be dev­as­tated by the virus.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic will pass, but many fear that our re­sponse to Covid-19 may have rav­aged ur­ban economies for good. Lock­downs shut­tered bars and turned restau­rants into “ghost kitchens” whose pri­mary pa­trons are over­worked DoorDash­ers. The overnight shift to re­mote work ob­vi­ated the need for of­fice build­ings and the vast econ­omy that sup­ports their work­ers, from pub­lic tran­sit to cor­ner stores. On­line com­merce, which had been dec­i­mat­ing phys­i­cal re­tail­ers for more than a decade, ac­cel­er­ated its crush­ing in­evitabil­ity. Even cul­tural in­sti­tu­tions seem at risk: If the mu­si­cal Hamil­ton didn’t lose much in the trans­la­tion from the Richard Rodgers The­atre to Dis­ney+, per­haps the end is nigh for Broad­way, too.</p>
    <p>Now that tech­nol­ogy can shower us with many of the ben­e­fits of ur­ban life while we laze about in giant ex­ur­ban McMan­sions, why would we ever re­turn to liv­ing and work­ing so close to­gether?</p>
    <p>Here’s one an­swer: be­cause nei­ther the United States nor the world can do with­out cities.</p>
    <p>They are in­dis­pens­able as en­gines of eco­nomic growth, cat­a­lysts of tech­no­log­i­cal and cul­tural in­no­va­tion – and they are one of the most en­vi­ron­men­tally sus­tain­able ways we know of for hous­ing lots of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Not only are cities worth sav­ing, they are also ripe for re­birth. The virus presents an op­por­tu­nity to re­make ur­ban life for the bet­ter, par­tic­u­larly by ad­dress­ing its in­equities.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the pan­demic has prompted cities around the world to em­brace once rad­i­cal-seem­ing ideas. In car-free streets and per­ma­nent al­fresco din­ing, a pic­ture of a more live­able city is emerg­ing. But we can do a lot more than pedes­tri­anise roads. Next year and be­yond, we should make re­build­ing our ur­ban land­scape a top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Con­trary to con­ven­tional wis­dom, ur­ban pop­u­la­tion den­sity does not seem to have been the pri­mary fac­tor in the virus’ spread – note how Asian mega cities like Hong Kong and Seoul com­bated the virus suc­cess­fully, while many</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ru­ral ar­eas suf­fered ma­jor out­breaks.</p>
    <p>But in New York and other Amer­i­can cities, over­crowd­ing within res­i­dences, caused by a lack of af­ford­able hous­ing, did ex­ac­er­bate the con­ta­gion. So let’s fix that: In ad­di­tion to loos­en­ing our an­ti­quated zon­ing rules, per­haps va­cant of­fice build­ings and re­tail space can be turned into apart­ments, low­er­ing the cost of hous­ing.</p>
    <p>This is also our chance to re­make crum­bling ur­ban in­fra­struc­ture – to cre­ate more en­gag­ing out­door pub­lic spa­ces and to rad­i­cally im­prove pub­lic trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>Then there is cli­mate change. Think of the coro­n­avirus as a trailer for the hor­ror flick of nat­u­ral dis­as­ters to come. We have a chance to for­tify ur­ban space against fu­ture out­breaks of dis­ease as well as the com­ing calami­ties caused by the chang­ing weather – we can even do both at the same time. For in­stance, re­duc­ing au­to­mo­bile traffic in cities will not just cut emis­sions that warm the cli­mate. It will also clean up the toxic air that hangs over our most pop­u­lous ar­eas, and that is thought to in­crease the risks of res­pi­ra­tory diseases, in­clud­ing sus­cep­ti­bil­ity to Covid-19. More walk­a­ble and bike­able ur­ban de­sign is good for the en­vi­ron­ment and our health; a study of com­muters in Bri­tain showed that bik­ing to work was as­so­ci­ated with lower risk of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease and can­cer.</p>
    <p>What’s im­por­tant here aren’t the spe­cific ideas, but the larger push for civic re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion. The coro­n­avirus does not have to kill cities – just our old idea of what cities were, how they worked and whom they were for.</p>
    <p>Re­think­ing ur­ban space in the af­ter­math of dis­ease is hardly a new idea. If cities were go­ing to be crushed by pesti­lence, they would have died mil­len­ni­ums ago. Dis­ease has shaped the mod­ern city, and the mod­ern city has shaped dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The prac­tice of epi­demi­ol­ogy was born in the city, when John Snow, a Lon­don anaes­the­si­ol­o­gist, tracked the spread of cholera to a con­tam­i­nated wa­ter pump in 1854. And much of the civic in­fra­struc­ture we now take for granted – pub­lic parks, garbage trucks, sew­ers – was put in place partly to curb dis­ease. Cities have over­come dis­ease be­fore, and they can do so again.</p>
    <p>Yet at the mo­ment, a grand project to re­build Amer­i­can cities feels ter­ri­bly elu­sive. De­spite their eco­nomic and cul­tural im­por­tance, cities in the US are of­ten marginalis­ed in pol­i­tics and, more deeply, in our pic­ture of how the coun­try should work. About 80 per cent of Amer­i­cans live in ur­ban ar­eas, but most say they’d rather live some­where else.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans use cities as a cud­gel – sup­pos­edly crime-rid­den “Demo­crat cities” be­came a mantra for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. Democrats de­pend on big cities and their sur­round­ing sub­urbs for the bulk of their vot­ers, but when was the last time you heard a na­tional Demo­cratic politi­cian make a force­ful case for the beauty, cre­ativ­ity and im­por­tance of cities – for all that we owe to them, and all we may yet gain from them?</p>
    <p>If we are to re­build US cities, we must recog­nise their value and sing their praises. We must learn to love their big­ness, their in­her­ent chaos, and ad­mit how bereft we would be with­out them.</p>
    <p>“Cities were once the most help­less and dev­as­tated vic­tims of dis­ease, but they be­came great dis­ease con­querors,” wrote the great ur­ban­ist Jane Ja­cobs in The Death And Life Of Great Amer­i­can Cities.</p>
    <p>Then she itemised their con­tri­bu­tions: “All the ap­pa­ra­tus of surgery, hy­giene, mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy, chem­istry, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, pub­lic health mea­sures, teach­ing and re­search hos­pi­tals, am­bu­lances and the like, which peo­ple not only in cities but also out­side them de­pend upon for the un­end­ing war against pre­ma­ture mor­tal­ity, are fun­da­men­tally prod­ucts of big cities and would be in­con­ceiv­able with­out big cities.”</p>
    <p>Cities cre­ated the fu­ture. Now we must se­cure theirs.</p>
    <p>Con­trary to con­ven­tional wis­dom, ur­ban pop­u­la­tion den­sity does not seem to have been the pri­mary fac­tor in the virus’ spread – note how Asian mega cities like Hong Kong and Seoul com­bated the virus suc­cess­fully, while many Amer­i­can ru­ral ar­eas suf­fered ma­jor out­breaks.</p>

This may be fixed, the writer sug&#xAD;gests, by loos&#xAD;en&#xAD;ing an&#xAD;ti&#xAD;quated zon&#xAD;ing rules and turn&#xAD;ing va&#xAD;cant of&#xAD;fice build&#xAD;ings and re&#xAD;tail space into apart&#xAD;ments, low&#xAD;er&#xAD;ing the cost of hous&#xAD;ing.</p>
