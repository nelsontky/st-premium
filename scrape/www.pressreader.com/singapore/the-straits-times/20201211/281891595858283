    <p>With the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore hav­ing an­nounced the winners of the li­cences for all-dig­i­tal banks last week, the play­ers now have a clearer idea of what com­pe­ti­tion they face when vir­tual banks are launched in Sin­ga­pore in 2022. On the re­tail side, the chal­lengers com­prise the Grab Hold­ings-Sing­tel con­sor­tium and tech gi­ant Sea; while in whole­sale bank­ing, which will serve cor­po­rates and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), the new play­ers will in­clude China’s Ant Group, and a con­sor­tium com­pris­ing Green­land Fi­nan­cial Hold­ings of China, Lin­kl­o­gis Hong Kong, a sup­ply chain fi­nanc­ing firm, and Bei­jing Co-op­er­a­tive Eq­uity In­vest­ment Fund Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Many an­a­lysts reckon the new whole­sale banks will have an eas­ier path­way to prof­itabil­ity given that they face fewer re­stric­tions in cater­ing to SMEs and mi­cro-en­ter­prises. The prospects for the all-dig­i­tal re­tail play­ers are con­sid­ered more chal­leng­ing. They will face tough ini­tial re­stric­tions on de­posit-tak­ing and lend­ing and will be up against for­mi­da­ble com­pe­ti­tion from in­cum­bent banks, which are well cap­i­talised, have es­tab­lished cus­tomer bases and are al­ready prof­itable. But the new­com­ers also have ad­van­tages which might be un­der­rated. As vir­tual en­ti­ties, they will have lower over­heads and thus lower costs. They also have sig­nif­i­cantly larger num­bers of cus­tomers, es­pe­cially out­side Sin­ga­pore, than the in­cum­bent banks – al­though they are not yet bank­ing cus­tomers. For ex­am­ple, Sing­tel has a cus­tomer base of some 700 mil­lion across the re­gion, Grab has about 200 mil­lion, and Sea about 500 mil­lion glob­ally. Nor will their fi­nan­cial ser­vices be launched from a stand­ing start.</p>
    <p>They al­ready pro­vide pay­ments ser­vices, as well as work­ing cap­i­tal loans, credit lines and basic in­vest­ment and in­sur­ance ser­vices. Some are also forg­ing strate­gic part­ner­ships, in­clud­ing with banks, as Grab is do­ing with MUFG of Ja­pan. There is ev­i­dence they can ap­peal to con­sumers. For ex­am­ple, a PwC sur­vey in Novem­ber last year showed that while 99 per cent of Sin­ga­pore cus­tomers are likely to re­tain their cur­rent pri­mary bank ac­counts even after open­ing a dig­i­tal bank ac­count, 71 per cent have at least one “pain point” with their tra­di­tional bank and 66 per cent would like their dig­i­tal bank to also pro­vide non-fi­nan­cial ser­vices – which the chal­lengers do.</p>
    <p>In an­tic­i­pa­tion of more com­pe­ti­tion, in­cum­bent banks have been in­no­vat­ing, by boost­ing their dig­i­tal of­fer­ings, im­prov­ing user ex­pe­ri­ence, rolling out new products such as col­lat­eral-free loans and forg­ing strate­gic part­ner­ships. So there are no ob­vi­ous winners in what prom­ises to be an en­gag­ing con­test. Much de­pends on how nim­ble and adap­tive the play­ers will be. But to the ex­tent that the ar­rival of di­gibanks ac­cel­er­ates fi­nan­cial in­no­va­tion over­all, Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial sec­tor will be the win­ner.</p>
