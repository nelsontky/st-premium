    <p>Foot­ball match fix­ing. “Cof­fee money” for ad­vance no­tice of site inspection­s. Kick­backs for or­ders placed with a sup­plier.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple are heed­less of the cor­rup­tion that ex­ists in squeaky clean Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Such a lack of aware­ness among the young, es­pe­cially, has prompted Sin­ga­pore’s graft busters to pro­duce an elec­tronic book to make them aware of graft and its pit­falls.</p>
    <p>The e-book is catered specif­i­cally to those aged be­tween 13 and 19. The Cor­rup­tion Casebook – Sto­ries From Un­der The Ta­ble is avail­able for down­load on the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau’s (CPIB) web­site at cpib.gov.sg.</p>
    <p>It comes after a Repub­lic Polytech­nic sur­vey this year showed only 34 per cent, in a poll of about 1,000 peo­ple aged be­tween 15 and 25, had come across the topic of cor­rup­tion in school.</p>
    <p>Close to three-quar­ters of them, or about 72 per cent, were also not aware of the ex­is­tence of the CPIB, which was formed in 1952 and is an agency un­der the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>Ms Clare Tan, the CPIB’s se­nior deputy direc­tor for plan­ning, re­search and cor­po­rate re­la­tions, said the lack of vis­i­ble cor­rup­tion in Sin­ga­pore to­day means young peo­ple are now less aware of the harm bribes can cause.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is in this state where we are clean and in­cor­rupt­ible and there’s zero tol­er­ance, but ac­tu­ally then (young peo­ple) may be­come com­pla­cent be­cause they live in an era where ev­ery­thing is nice, so you don’t re­ally see cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>“There is cor­rup­tion, it’s just that they don’t see it.”</p>
    <p>While the cases may not be as vis­i­ble, the consequenc­es of the bribes can di­rectly im­pact peo­ple.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, bribes paid for le­niency when check­ing for mos­quito breed­ing sites are es­pe­cially in­sid­i­ous in a year that has seen the dengue death toll hit a record high of 29 amid Sin­ga­pore’s largest out­break.</p>
    <p>In pro­duc­ing the book, the bureau con­sulted stu­dents from St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion to find out which cases would best ap­peal to the tar­get au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>It also en­gaged Mr Melvin­der­pal Singh, a copy edi­tor with The Straits Times, to write the book.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh, 53, said he was mo­ti­vated to get in­volved after re­al­is­ing his three sons – aged 15 to 19 – did not know much about the ef­forts of those who made Sin­ga­pore the hon­est and trans­par­ent coun­try it is to­day.</p>
    <p>“They knew lit­tle of Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory and the work, of­ten be­hind the scenes, of our sol­diers, cops and other law en­force­ment of­fi­cers,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In teach­ing my boys about the dan­gers of drugs – no such things as soft drugs – and cor­rup­tion – yes, even $1 is cor­rup­tion – I re­alised my boys may not be the ex­cep­tion. So when the idea for an anti-cor­rup­tion book for young peo­ple was mooted, I jumped at the chance to con­trib­ute,” he added.</p>
    <p>The e-book fea­tures 16 cu­rated cases of cor­rup­tion, split up into six chap­ters that demon­strate how cor­rup­tion af­fects ar­eas such as na­tional se­cu­rity, pub­lic health, and even the in­tegrity of the sport­ing world.</p>
    <p>It con­cludes: “While the im­pact of a bribe has di­rect bear­ing on the cor­rupt in­di­vid­u­als and the rep­u­ta­tion of the or­gan­i­sa­tions im­pli­cated, it goes beyond that. There is an in­di­rect im­pact on pub­lic funds, eco­nomic growth, qual­ity of in­fra­struc­ture and pub­lic ser­vices...</p>
    <p>“CPIB may be the graft busters but we all play a role in en­sur­ing cor­rup­tion is never al­lowed to sink its roots in Sin­ga­pore. To fight this en­emy, we need to first recog­nise it.”</p>
