    <p>I am see­ing Sin­ga­pore in a newer light, just be­cause it is joy­fully odd­ball to go on a Crazy Rich Asians tour of a city I have known all my life.</p>
    <p>More than that, it is a new ex­pe­ri­ence to time-travel be­tween a van­ished Sin­ga­pore and its glitzy 2020 fa­cade in a vin­tage Vespa side­car tootling to luxe film lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Lov­ingly re­stored, the sleek red ma­chine has hid­den roots i n Jurong, I learn. An assem­bly plant for th­ese Ital­ian scoot­ers opened in 1965 here as a pi­o­neer industry.</p>
    <p>I would not have linked the baby Vespa scooter from Sin­ga­pore’s hun­gry years to the Hol­ly­wood block­buster Crazy Rich Asians (2018) or the novel that in­spired it.</p>
    <p>But the tour and the movie share lots of es­capist fun and In­sta­mo­ments.</p>
    <p>My road trip high­lights In­sta­gram-cool film sites such as Gar­dens by the Bay and it ends on a high with a pri­vate cock­tail work­shop at the Man­darin Ori­en­tal.</p>
    <p>Like an open­ing se­quence in a movie, five suave men ap­pear around the cor­ner of The Arts House, rid­ing in for­ma­tion. We whip out smart­phones at the vi­sion of retro side­cars in vivid colours be­fore we flag off.</p>
    <p>This is in­her­ently a safedis­tanced out­ing for our group of five, since we sit in our own side­car for the fresh-air jaunt around town. The max­i­mum group size is 10.</p>
    <p>It is lib­er­at­ing to re­dis­cover the city in this sen­sory style, with just a hel­met be­tween me and the muchad­mired sky­line.</p>
    <p>We whiz along the F1 cir­cuit at speeds be­tween 30 and 50kmh, but it feels a lot faster – an il­lu­sion be­cause our side­cars are glid­ing close to the ground.</p>
    <p>The ap­proach to Ma­rina Bay Sands is in­spir­ing, com­pared with speed­ing past in a car. In a Vespa, it feels like a long road is con­vey­ing me to the triple tow­ers. And it is a movie-magic mo­ment when the can­tilevered sky gar­den soars over­head.</p>
    <p>With this im­age of Sin­ga­pore’s sky­ward am­bi­tion lodged in my mind, we ride on to Gar­dens by the Bay. In the movie, the wed­ding din­ner of high-so­ci­ety lovers Aram­inta Lee and Colin Khoo was cel­e­brated at the fan­tas­ti­cal Su­pertree Grove.</p>
    <p>As we grin and po­si­tion our­selves for a we­fie, Mr Si­mon Wong, co­founder of the Sin­ga­poreSide­cars tour com­pany and social en­ter­prise, says of the fu­sion tableau: “Su­pertrees and side­cars.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, also my mo­tor­cy­clist­guide that Mon­day morn­ing, may well be al­lud­ing to the spirit of the half-dozen play­ful, edgy Vespa side­car ex­cur­sions he has con­cep­tu­alised.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude a Kam­pong Glam hip her­itage ride and a soon-to­launch spin around Telok Ku­rau, where found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew grew up.</p>
    <p>This is an “in­sider’s in­sider” tour that also em­beds an out­doorcin­ema ex­pe­ri­ence, Mr Wong says.</p>
    <p>It is a sul­try day, but the side­car is com­fort­able and we stay cool while mov­ing on to Chi­jmes, where Aram­inta Lee mem­o­rably wafts through a wa­ter-filled aisle in bridal glory.</p>
    <p>Other stops in­clude the Hump­back restau­rant in Bukit Pa­soh, where Rachel Chu and best friend Goh Peik Lin have their heart-to­heart and play out their un­scripted “pok pok” scene at a bar ta­ble fac­ing con­ser­va­tion shop­houses.</p>
    <p>Here and else­where, our mot­ley crew and side­cars are greeted with smiles and smart­phone cam­eras. Th­ese are mo­ments of lev­ity for pass­ing strangers in a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ex­hil­a­rated, we wrap up the morn­ing at the chic Mo Bar at the Man­darin Ori­en­tal ho­tel, where it is a no­madic jour­ney through re­gional flavours and aro­mas.</p>
    <p>Bar man­ager Adrian Besa guides us in con­coct­ing or sam­pling art­ful cock­tails such as The Elixir, re­fresh­ingly cit­rusy with kaffir lime­in­fused gin and a dash of bit­ters.</p>
    <p>We also peer into his se­cret world of molec­u­lar mixol­ogy, where flavours are ex­tracted with nifty whirling ma­chines.</p>
    <p>It is a happy hour-plus and I have so many in­stant favourites, from the Har­vest Queen (guava and ap­ple juices shaken with egg white and topped with ed­i­ble Viet­namese rice paper printed with a pea­cock pat­tern) to Lantern (chilli gin, cu­cum­ber and chicken rice broth).</p>
    <p>In vari­a­tions of our tour, this cock­tail ex­pe­ri­ence is swopped for dumpling mak­ing, mahjong or tea with tai-tais, mir­ror­ing sig­na­ture scenes from the movie.</p>
    <p>Like the best travel, that day is a lay­ered ex­pe­ri­ence that im­merses and de­lights me, and I also make new friends.</p>
    <p>Days later, I ex­plore the Kranji coun­try­side with two of my “travel com­pan­ions”, con­tin­u­ing our hy­per-lo­cal jour­ney around Sin­ga­pore.</p>
