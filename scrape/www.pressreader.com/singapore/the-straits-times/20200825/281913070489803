    <p>WASHINGTON • Protests have erupted in Kenosha in the US state of Wis­con­sin af­ter po­lice shot an ap­par­ently un­armed black man mul­ti­ple times in the back, ac­cord­ing to the state gov­er­nor, prompt­ing the au­thor­i­ties to im­pose a cur­few.</p>
    <p>The i nci­dent on Sun­day is likely to fuel fur­ther ou­trage and protests in the United States and abroad against po­lice bru­tal­ity and racism in the wake of the killing of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, an un­armed black man who died in po­lice custody in Min­neapo­lis on May 25.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim in Kenosha, iden­ti­fied by Wis­con­sin Gov­er­nor Tony Evers as Mr Ja­cob Blake, was hos­pi­talised in se­ri­ous con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>A video cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia showed a man walk­ing to­wards a car fol­lowed by two of­fi­cers and one of them shoot­ing him as he opens the car door.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter, mul­ti­ple fires were set at the scene by a crowd that gath­ered to protest against the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia posts showed crowds march­ing down t he streets of Kenosha, a city of around 100,000 peo­ple on Lake Michi­gan about 100km north of Chicago, and throw­ing Molo­tov cock­tails and bricks at po­lice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Po­lice re­sponded by im­pos­ing a city­wide cur­few un­til 7am lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>The shoot­ing oc­curred at around 5pm as of­fi­cers were re­spond­ing to what they called a “do­mes­tic in­ci­dent”.</p>
    <p>State au­thor­i­ties have not given fur­ther ex­pla­na­tion on what led to the shoot­ing but said they aim to is­sue a re­port to prose­cu­tors within 30 days.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers in­volved in the shoot­ing have been placed on ad­min­is­tra­tive leave.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Evers, in a tweet, said Mr Blake had been “shot in the back mul­ti­ple times in broad day­light”, adding: “We stand against ex­ces­sive use of force and im­me­di­ate es­ca­la­tion when en­gag­ing with black Wis­con­sinites.”</p>
