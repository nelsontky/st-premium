    <p>A 62-year-old Sin­ga­porean man who had a his­tory of di­a­betes, hy­per­ten­sion and high choles­terol died from com­pli­ca­tions due to Covid-19 yes­ter­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The pa­tient, iden­ti­fied as Case 17,168, was con­firmed to be Covid-19 pos­i­tive on April 30, and he had a his­tory of di­a­betes mel­li­tus, hy­per­ten­sion and hy­per­lip­i­daemia, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal – where the man died – has con­tacted his fam­ily and is ex­tend­ing as­sis­tance to them.</p>
    <p>He is the 27th pa­tient to die from the virus here, while 14 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Seven cases in the com­mu­nity were an­nounced yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing one Sin­ga­porean, three work pass hold­ers and three work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Three of the com­mu­nity cases are linked to pre­vi­ous cases or clus­ters.</p>
    <p>They were all iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ously con­firmed cases, and were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine even though they were asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing four com­mu­nity cases are cur­rently un­linked. They are all in the con­struc­tion sec­tor, and were swabbed as part of pe­ri­odic screen­ing of work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices who are liv­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions for the un­linked cases are be­ing done, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Two im­ported cases were also an­nounced yes­ter­day. Both are Sin­ga­pore­ans who re­turned from In­dia last Thurs­day. They had been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were tested while serv­ing the no­tice.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dian Xiao Er restau­rant in Jem was added to the MOH list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond visit to FoodXchang­e @ Ad­mi­ralty, lo­cated at 8A Ad­mi­ralty Street, was also added, but MOH did not say whether two pa­tients made a visit sep­a­rately or one pa­tient vis­ited the lo­ca­tion twice.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 338 cases, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 46,629.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced a new clus­ter in a dor­mi­tory at 96 Kaki Bukit In­dus­trial Ter­race.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity dur­ing a week has de­creased from 14 cases two weeks ago to 13 in the past week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity dur­ing a week has in­creased from a daily av­er­age of six cases to seven over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 196 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 42,723 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 161 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 3,704 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. There are no pa­tients in in­ten­sive care.</p>
