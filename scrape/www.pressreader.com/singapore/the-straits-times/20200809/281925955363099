    <p>It was 6pm on Tues­day when Mr Ge­orges Jab­bour was at the Na­tional Evan­gel­i­cal Church of Beirut, help­ing out at his cousin’s wed­ding cer­e­mony which was due to start in an hour.</p>
    <p>The pri­est had just ar­rived at the church, about 2km from the Beirut port, when there was an ex­plo­sion. It seemed like a lo­calised car bomb.</p>
    <p>“We are, un­for­tu­nately, used to car bombs and wars. I first thought it was a car bomb. But when I saw the pink­ish smoke, I knew it was some­thing else,” Mr Jab­bour, 35, said.</p>
    <p>Mo­ments later, there was a sec­ond, more pow­er­ful ex­plo­sion. The en­su­ing shock wave shook the ground, shat­tered glass and dam­aged build­ings.</p>
    <p>It was so pow­er­ful, the seis­mo­log­i­cal mon­i­tors reg­is­tered it as the equiv­a­lent of a mag­ni­tude 3.3 earthquake, and tremors were felt in Cyprus, a coun­try 250km away.</p>
    <p>By the next day, at least 137 were con­firmed killed i n Beirut and 4,000 peo­ple in­jured. The death toll has since risen to 158, with 6,000 in­jured. Many more were left home­less overnight.</p>
    <p>“It was like a war zone,” said Mr Mah­moud Mar­wan Zahraun, 25, an elec­tri­cal engi­neer who was, at that time, in his of­fice in the Raoucheh neigh­bour­hood just 3km west of the blast site.</p>
    <p>“Dead bod­ies every­where, and for a few days, the de­bris re­mained on the streets. Many of my friends were in­jured by the fly­ing de­bris.”</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Evan­gel­i­cal Church of Beirut, sit­u­ated in the cen­tral dis­trict, was rel­a­tively un­scathed. But the pri­est was in­jured and rushed to the hospi­tal, and the wed­ding had to be can­celled.</p>
    <p>“Glass shat­tered be­hind me but I was con­sid­ered lucky. My friends were not as lucky. A lot of them live in Gem­mayze and Mar Mikhael, two neigh­bour­hoods right in front of the port, and they are home­less now.</p>
    <p>“Many of them were i njured, too,” said Mr Jab­bour.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has ar­rested dozens of peo­ple and fo­cused its in­ves­ti­ga­tion on the 2,750 tonnes of am­mo­nium ni­trate stored in the ware­house at the port prior to the ex­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>But con­spir­acy the­o­ries about a nu­clear bomb or a mil­i­tary at­tack blamed on the United States, Is­rael or even mil­i­tant group Hizbol­lah have spread all over Le­banese so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Beirut-based tech en­tre­pre­neur Sarah Ab­dal­lah, 31, said she was at her home 10km from the blast site when she heard what sounded like a war­plane fly­ing over­head mo­ments be­fore the blast.</p>
    <p>While these claims are un­proven – the au­thor­i­ties i n Is­rael and Lebanon have dis­missed such sug­ges­tions – many Le­banese con­tinue to cast doubt on the of­fi­cial ver­sion of events that tragic day.</p>
    <p>“You can never rule any­thing out. I don’t think the truth will ever come out,” said Ms Ab­dal­lah.</p>
    <p>Her scep­ti­cism re­flects the deep mis­trust many Le­banese have of their gov­ern­ment, ac­cu­mu­lated over decades of eco­nomic mis­man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy had col­lapsed in Oc­to­ber last year. The Le­banese pound, pegged at 1,500 to the US dol­lar for decades, lost 80 per cent of its value af­ter the coun­try ran short of dol­lars to main­tain the peg.</p>
    <p>The new gov­ern­ment, in­stalled in Jan­uary af­ter a mas­sive protest top­pled the pre­vi­ous one, was per­ceived to have failed to bring about mean­ing­ful im­prove­ments.</p>
    <p>Lock­down mea­sures to con­trol the coro­n­avirus spread dealt a fur­ther blow to the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>DYS­FUNC­TIONAL ECON­OMY</p>
    <p>One in six Le­banese lives in poverty, ac­cord­ing to United Na­tions data. In Beirut, fuel short­ages of­ten re­sult in power cuts and black­outs.</p>
    <p>Since Oc­to­ber, in­fla­tion has climbed to more than 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>Food prices have surged 190 per cent in May from a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data cited by Credit Libanais.</p>
    <p>In June, lamb was sell­ing at around US$53 (S$73) per kilo­gram while beef was US$33 a kilo­gram. The meats were so ex­pen­sive, the army re­moved them from meals of­fered to sol­diers, state me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Ms Ab­dal­lah is fork­ing out onethird of her in­come to pay for elec­tric­ity every month.</p>
    <p>“We’re pay­ing US$200 to US$300 a month for power that comes on only one to two hours a day. We have to use an ex­ter­nal gen­er­a­tor for elec­tric­ity,” she said.</p>
    <p>Lebanon is heav­ily re­liant on im­ports, es­pe­cially food sup­plies. It cur­rently im­ports more than half of what it con­sumes, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>And the coun­try re­lies on pri­vately owned mills to ship wheat from Ukraine, Rus­sia and other Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But the ex­plo­sion de­stroyed the coun­try’s only large grain silo and dis­abled a port which han­dles 60 per cent of Lebanon’s im­ports.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the dis­as­ter, many Le­banese felt they were al­ready de­prived of many ba­sic needs.</p>
    <p>Con­trols im­posed by Le­banese banks on ac­cess to cash last year fur­ther irked de­pos­i­tors like Ms Ab­dal­lah, who now wor­ries that even her sav­ings will be taken away.</p>
    <p>“My fa­ther, a re­tired sol­dier, used to re­ceive a pen­sion of US$4,000 every month. Now it’s re­duced to US$1,000.</p>
    <p>“I’ve worked for more than 10 years in Lebanon and all my sav­ings are gone be­cause our as­sets are frozen.</p>
    <p>“We have no clean wa­ter, and es­sen­tial ser­vices like the elec­tric­ity and In­ter­net ser­vices were al­ready dis­rupted be­fore the ex­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple don’t know what to eat and what to drink, and yet the gov­ern­ment con­tin­ues to steal from us,” Ms Ab­dal­lah said.</p>
    <p>“I read about Kuwait send­ing masks to Lebanon for pan­demic re­lief, but where are the masks? So far, I see them only be­ing sold in the phar­macy.”</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial cri­sis forced her to shut down a tech start-up that she founded, and work as a free­lance con­sul­tant for over­seas-based clients, but even that is in jeop­ardy.</p>
    <p>“Many of my clients are based in the United Arab Emi­rates. With the In­ter­net dis­rup­tion, it has be­come harder for me to work.”</p>
    <p>The core of the prob­lem, she said, was not the ab­sence of a so­lu­tion, but peo­ple to solve these crises be­cause “they are all busy abus­ing their power”.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, who ar­rived in Beirut on Thurs­day, told an­gry crowds that he wanted to lead a global re­sponse and would seek a new deal with the po­lit­i­cal au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He promised to send more med­i­cal and other aid to Lebanon, a former French colony, and said: “But what is also needed here is po­lit­i­cal change. This ex­plo­sion should be the start of a new era.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Le­banese noted that the lo­cal gov­ern­ment has been slow to act.</p>
    <p>HELP­ING THEM­SELVES</p>
    <p>Peo­ple like Mr Jab­bour and Mr Mah­moud took it upon them­selves to clean up the de­bris and help those who lost their homes to find a shel­ter.</p>
    <p>“I’ve given up ex­pect­ing any­thing from the gov­ern­ment. I’ve seen re­lief aid com­ing in from Turkey and France, but there wasn’t much from the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“The ex­plo­sion hap­pened at a wrong time. Our liveli­hoods were al­ready af­fected by the po­lit­i­cal un­rest and the fi­nan­cial cri­sis, and peo­ple on the streets were al­ready un­happy.</p>
    <p>“Now we will suf­fer even more. “I don’t know what will hap­pen to­mor­row and the day af­ter. I’ve not re­turned to my of­fice since the day of the ex­plo­sion, and I don’t know if I will keep my job. For now, I will just help in vol­un­teer­ing as much as I can,” said Mr Mah­moud.</p>
    <p>The Le­banese had to en­dure a civil war from 1975 to 1990, and a series of other con­flicts since. But they pride them­selves on their re­silience.</p>
    <p>The Beirut port ex­plo­sion will once again test them.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple say we Le­banese rise like a phoenix from the ashes. But the ashes are get­ting very heavy,” Ms Ab­dal­lah said. “In the past, peo­ple were al­ways di­vided even in their an­guish to­wards the gov­ern­ment. I hope that as a re­sult of the ex­plo­sion, they can fi­nally unite and change things for the bet­ter.”</p>
