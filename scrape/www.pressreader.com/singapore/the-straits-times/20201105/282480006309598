    <p>BEI­JING • The re­cov­ery in China’s ser­vice sec­tor ac­tiv­ity ex­tended into a sixth straight month in Oc­to­ber, an in­dus­try sur­vey showed yes­ter­day, with hir­ing pick­ing up to the high­est level in a year but over­seas de­mand slip­ping.</p>
    <p>The Caixin/Markit ser­vices Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) rose to 56.8 from Septem­ber’s 54.8, the high­est read­ing since June and stay­ing well above the 50-mark that sep­a­rates monthly growth from con­trac­tion. The ser­vice sec­tor, which ac­counts for about 60 per cent of the economy and half of ur­ban jobs, had ini­tially been slower to re­turn to growth than large man­u­fac­tur­ers, but the re­cov­ery has gath­ered pace in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic de­mand drove ac­tiv­ity, with the sur­vey showing new ex­port busi­ness re­ceived by Chi­nese ser­vice firms slip­ping fur­ther into con­trac­tion last month, at the fastest rate since July.</p>
    <p>“The sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in Europe and the third wave in the US have sig­nif­i­cantly sup­pressed China’s over­seas de­mand,” said Mr Wang Zhe, se­nior econ­o­mist at Caixin In­sight Group, in com­ments re­leased along­side the sur­vey.</p>
    <p>But firms hired more for the third month in a row and at the fastest pace since Septem­ber last year, in­di­cat­ing a strength­en­ing re­cov­ery in a labour mar­ket hit hard ear­lier in the year by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice firms were highly op­ti­mistic about busi­ness prospects, with a sub-in­dex for con­fi­dence in the year ris­ing to the strong­est level since 2012.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial PMI showed that ac­tiv­ity in China’s ser­vice sec­tor ex­panded at the fastest pace last month since 2013. Pent-up de­mand, stim­u­lus­driven in­fra­struc­ture ex­pan­sion and sur­pris­ingly re­silient ex­ports have pro­pelled China’s re­bound, though the global out­look is dim­ming as many Western coun­tries bat­tle re­newed surges in virus cases, with some go­ing back into lock­downs.</p>
    <p>“In the com­ing months, a con­tin­ued re­cov­ery of the Chi­nese economy is highly likely, but it is nec­es­sary to be cau­tious about the nor­mal­i­sa­tion of mon­e­tary and fis­cal poli­cies in the post-epi­demic pe­riod,” Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>China’s economy grew a weaker-than-ex­pected 4.9 per cent in the third quar­ter from a year ear­lier. It is ex­pected to ex­pand around 2 per cent for the full year, the weak­est in over three decades but still much stronger than other ma­jor economies.</p>
