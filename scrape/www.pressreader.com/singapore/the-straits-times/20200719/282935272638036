    <p>Just about ev­ery area of per­sonal finance has been af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, in­clud­ing as­pi­ra­tional pur­chases such as art, cars, watches and wine.</p>
    <p>Auc­tions for buy­ing and sell­ing many of these ob­jects have been ren­dered un­ten­able since March be­cause of so­cial dis­tanc­ing curbs. But the de­sire re­mains, with sell­ers look­ing to shed valu­able items to shore up their own bal­ance sheets, and buy­ers who have re­serves look­ing to col­lect on the cheap.</p>
    <p>To meet that de­mand, the rar­efied world of the auc­tion house has been forced on­line.</p>
    <p>But auc­tion houses are work­ing to en­sure sell­ing their high-ticket ob­jects don’t de­volve into an eBay frenzy, where wealthy buy­ers are sit­ting around in their py­ja­mas stalk­ing deals on their lap­tops.</p>
    <p>To coun­ter­act that down-mar­ket feel, auc­tion­eers have be­come more cre­ative.</p>
    <p>Sotheby’s, for one, has built a plat­form for its on­line-only auc­tions that pre­vents peo­ple from en­ter­ing a bid just as the time is about to ex­pire, a strat­egy known as snip­ing.</p>
    <p>“If some­one snipes at the last minute, the sale ex­tends for an­other five min­utes,” said Mr Richard Lopez, head of on­line sales and a se­nior watch spe­cial­ist at Sotheby’s.</p>
    <p>Auc­tions tend to be sea­sonal, and many are smaller now that they are on­line. Sev­eral an­nual Cal­i­for­nia car auc­tions next month in Peb­ble Beach and Mon­terey in Cal­i­for­nia are plan­ning to present half the num­ber of ve­hi­cles on­line that they did in in-per­son auc­tions last year. But be­cause sell­ers may need cash dur­ing this pe­riod, there may be more deals for peo­ple with money to in­vest in these illiq­uid as­sets.</p>
    <p>ART</p>
    <p>Sotheby’s con­tem­po­rary art sale, held on­line at the end of June, was the first big test of vir­tual auc­tions. Some ma­jor pieces still sold for top dol­lar. A Francis Ba­con trip­tych sold for nearly US$85 mil­lion (S$118 mil­lion) above its es­ti­mate. A JeanMichel Basquiat draw­ing went for US$15 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been lucky at Sotheby’s be­cause with our on­line plat­form, we’ve been able to switch over with the same level of trust,” Mr Lopez said. When asked what was lost on­line, he re­sponded with­out hes­i­ta­tion: “The fun.” Still, the push to move auc­tions on­line has its risks. Sto­ries abound of buy­ers be­ing duped by high-end gal­leries.</p>
    <p>CARS</p>
    <p>Au­gust would nor­mally send some of the world’s most ex­pen­sive cars to the Mon­terey Penin­sula for the an­nual Peb­ble Beach Con­cours d’El­e­gance, where rare au­to­mo­biles are parked for a day on the 18th fair­way at Peb­ble Beach Golf Links.</p>
    <p>That’s not hap­pen­ing this year. Good­ing & Com­pany and Bon­hams, two auc­tion houses with large au­to­mo­tive depart­ments, will present about half the cars they would have in a live auc­tion, and rely on video and lim­ited in-per­son view­ing to drum up in­ter­est. Both houses are up­beat about the on­line de­mand.</p>
    <p>Mr David Good­ing, pres­i­dent of his name­sake com­pany, said: “If they’re pas­sion­ate about cars, they’re tap­ping that pas­sion. We’re see­ing de­mand and in­ter­est as strong as ever.”</p>
    <p>There is far less am­biva­lence now than ahead of a typ­i­cal live auc­tion. Sell­ers re­ally want to sell their cars, and buy­ers are fo­cused on get­ting the car they want.</p>
    <p>A few cars are priced in ex­cess of US$2 mil­lion but many are in the US$50,000 to US$100,000 range, he said.</p>
    <p>To give as­sur­ance on the cars’ con­di­tion, the auc­tion house is hold­ing them in a Los An­ge­les ware­house. Bon­hams is sim­i­larly stor­ing its cars, split­ting them be­tween Los An­ge­les in Cal­i­for­nia and Bed­ford, New York, where spe­cial­ists can ar­range vir­tual or in-per­son view­ings be­fore the Au­gust sale.</p>
    <p>Some of the high­est-priced cars may be the eas­i­est to sell at an on­line auc­tion, said Mr Jakob Greisen, head of Bon­hams’ US mo­tor­ing de­part­ment. The sale’s sig­na­ture car is a 1934 Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 Cabri­o­let by Figoni, es­ti­mated to sell for as much as US$7.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>WATCHES</p>
    <p>What’s ex­pen­sive is al­ways rel­a­tive. A US$28,000 Rolex is in­ex­pen­sive com­pared with a mil­lion-dol­lar car, but there is one par­tic­u­lar model from the iconic watch­maker that has had a star turn dur­ing the pan­demic: the Rolex Day­tona with a ce­ramic bezel.</p>
    <p>The watch has a re­tail price of US$13,000 but has been sell­ing for US$20,000 to US$30,000 in on­line auc­tions. Sotheby’s re­cently sold one for US$28,000. “You can buy it re­tail, but the wait list is two to three years,” Mr Lopez said.</p>
    <p>Watches lend them­selves to the on­line scrolling so many of us have been do­ing to pass the time. And that has pushed Sotheby’s watch de­part­ment to move to weekly and monthly auc­tions, scrap­ping its pre­vi­ous for­mat of semi-an­nual New York auc­tions.</p>
    <p>WINE</p>
    <p>Fine wine can sit in a bot­tle for decades and, po­ten­tially, get bet­ter. But the pri­mary mech­a­nism for sell­ing first-growth wine from Bordeaux, France – the most re­li­ably col­lectable re­gion in the wine world – is to sell wine fu­tures a few months af­ter the wine is put into a bar­rel. Fu­tures, the prices for wine that won’t ar­rive in buy­ers’ cel­lars for sev­eral years, have tra­di­tion­ally been set by work­ing with wine bro­kers through a marketplac­e called the Place du Bordeaux.</p>
    <p>This year, the process of tast­ing young wines to divine which ones will age well was dis­rupted be­cause no one could travel to Bordeaux to sam­ple the 2019 vin­tage.</p>
    <p>To sell the wine, which is con­sid­ered a top vin­tage, Bordeaux pro­duc­ers are dis­count­ing it heav­ily, said Mr Tom Gear­ing, chief ex­ec­u­tive and a co-founder of Cult Wines, which man­ages in­vest­ment-grade wine. “With the un­cer­tain econ­omy, peo­ple are in the po­si­tion to ask, ‘Do I re­ally want to shell out money for a wine I won’t have phys­i­cally for two years?’” he said.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age buy­ers, pro­duc­ers, even among the top five Bordeaux houses, such as Roth­schild and Mar­gaux, have dis­counted this vin­tage as much as 25 per cent from the 2018 vin­tage (which is con­sid­ered not as good).</p>
    <p>As with all of these pas­sion in­vest­ments, fine wine is a deal only if you are among the lucky few who have weathered the eco­nomic cri­sis with dis­pos­able in­come and con­fi­dence in the fu­ture.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Roy Licht&#xAD;en&#xAD;stein&#x2019;s Nude With Joy&#xAD;ous was the big seller at a Christie&#x2019;s hy&#xAD;brid sale on July 10.
