    <p>A 55-year-old man ap­peared in a dis­trict court yes­ter­day after he al­legedly killed an­other man in Beach Road on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Chng Hock Choon was charged with one count of mur­der.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean al­legedly killed Mr Miski­man Maakip at a grass patch near Block 5, Beach Road, at around 3pm that day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said in a state­ment on Mon­day that they were alerted to the in­ci­dent at around 3pm on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers who ar­rived soon after found 67-year-old Mr Miski­man ly­ing mo­tion­less at the scene.</p>
    <p>He was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal and was pro­nounced dead later.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim’s grand­daugh­ter, pre-school teacher Emil­lia Mar­linda, 22, told The New Pa­per that she ran to her flat after see­ing that some­one had col­lapsed on a nearby grass patch.</p>
    <p>Her father then recog­nised the man as her grand­fa­ther and they both rushed down­stairs.</p>
    <p>Ms Emil­lia told TNP: “(My fam­ily) cried when we saw him, we couldn’t take it.”</p>
    <p>She added that her grand­fa­ther had lived with her and four other fam­ily mem­bers in the area for about 10 years.</p>
    <p>She said: “He was a happy-go-lucky man and liked to roam around down­stairs... We’re still try­ing to ac­cept his death.”</p>
    <p>A wit­ness, who was not named, told Chi­nese-lan­guage news­pa­per Shin Min Daily News that he saw a man rain­ing blows on an­other man on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The wit­ness said: “He was hitting the man’s head and body, and later, the man fell to the ground and stopped mov­ing.”</p>
    <p>An­other wit­ness, a 63-year-old cleaner who was also not named in the ear­lier news re­ports, said he was pass­ing by when he saw a man kneel­ing on the grass and mut­ter­ing to him­self.</p>
    <p>The cleaner de­cided to take a closer look and was shocked to see an­other man ly­ing on the ground.</p>
    <p>Chng, who ap­peared via video link from Cen­tral Po­lice Di­vi­sion, told the court yes­ter­day: “That per­son stole my money.”</p>
    <p>He did not say whom he was re­fer­ring to.</p>
    <p>Chng will be re­manded for psy­chi­atric ob­ser­va­tion at Changi Prison Com­plex Med­i­cal Cen­tre and will be back in court on Oct 6.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of mur­der will face the death penalty.</p>
