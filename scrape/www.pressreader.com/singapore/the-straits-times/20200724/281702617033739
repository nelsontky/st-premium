    <p>Q The num­ber of com­mu­nity cases in Sin­ga­pore looks man­age­able. Does this mean it is safe to so­cialise more?</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR TEO YIK YING: The sit­u­a­tion in the com­mu­nity does look promis­ing these days, but I think it’s im­por­tant to re­mem­ber all the pains that we, the peo­ple, the coun­try, had to go through to get here.</p>
    <p>It all comes down to how of­ten we par­tic­i­pate in risk-tak­ing ad­ven­tures and whether we are work­ing within a sphere where we are fairly con­fi­dent that it’s go­ing to be fairly safe.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, I meet my par­ents for a meal per­haps once a fort­night. I don’t think that is a high</p>
    <p>Q Many coun­tries are re­port­ing a resur­gence in Covid-19 cases. Are we likely to have a sec­ond wave in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>PROF TEO: We will work very, very hard to avoid a sec­ond wave. We may have 10, 20 com­mu­nity cases every day, but most of our ac­tiv­i­ties can re­sume be­cause the risk that we pose to one an­other will be kept to a min­i­mum if we fol­low the three rules we al­ways talk about – mask wear­ing, per­sonal hy­giene, so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is equally sus­cep­ti­ble to a sec­ond wave if peo­ple start to be a lit­tle bit ‘cow­boy’ in their be­hav­iour and take risks un­nec­es­sar­ily. If there are a lot more gath­er­ings of 10, 20 peo­ple at homes, for par­ties, for meals, that in­creases the risk.</p>
