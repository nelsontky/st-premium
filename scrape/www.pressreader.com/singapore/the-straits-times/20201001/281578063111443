    <p>While pro­fes­sional sports in Sin­ga­pore may make a re­turn soon, other na­tional ath­letes, who are largely am­a­teurs, are grow­ing weary of the wait amid the Covid-19 cri­sis. They have not re­sumed full train­ing ow­ing to health re­stric­tions and many have writ­ten off the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>Even as Sin­ga­pore­ans have wel­comed the eas­ing of Covid-19 mea­sures in many sec­tors in re­cent weeks, sport in the Repub­lic has re­mained largely dor­mant.</p>
    <p>There are some pos­i­tive signs with the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League foot­ball com­pe­ti­tion tar­get­ing an Oct 10 restart and mixed martial arts or­gan­i­sa­tion One Cham­pi­onship work­ing on a live closed­door show here this month.</p>
    <p>But th­ese events cater to pro­fes­sional ath­letes and for the ma­jor­ity of na­tional ath­letes still re­quired to fol­low phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments and the “rule of five” for group ac­tiv­i­ties, the wait­ing game con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>Nur Ashriq Fer­daus, cap­tain of the men’s na­tional hockey team, said he and his team­mates have been re­stricted to skill-based drills dur­ing train­ing.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old added: “Whether it’s lo­cal or over­seas com­pe­ti­tions, the feeling of com­pet­ing and the in­ten­sity of train­ing in pre­par­ing for a tour­na­ment are things I miss.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hockey Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Mathavan Devadas said the fa­tigue is ex­ac­er­bated by how neigh­bour­ing coun­tries, like Malaysia, have al­ready re­turned to com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand that be­cause sport in­volves con­tact, there is some con­cern,” he said. “But (sports com­pe­ti­tion) has re­sumed in other places with­out se­ri­ous es­ca­la­tion of the health sit­u­a­tion… so I re­ally do hope that we can move for­ward soon.”</p>
    <p>For na­tional high jumper Kamp­ton Kam, re­stric­tions over ac­cess to his train­ing base at the Home of Ath­let­ics in Kal­lang has seen his train­ing group dwin­dle from 10 to three.</p>
    <p>“Plus, be­cause of the 50-per­son limit rule (in­side a sta­dium at any one time), some­times we have to queue out­side for a while be­fore be­ing al­lowed in,” he said.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old added: “The re­stric­tions do come at a cer­tain in­con­ve­nience to ath­letes and af­fects us train­ing-wise. It forces us to adapt and make cer­tain changes that may not bring about the best train­ing en­vi­ron­ment... but we are still grate­ful we are able to train at all.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional net­ball vice-cap­tain Aqi­lah Andin and her team­mates have had five work­out ses­sions a week since Phase Two be­gan in June but have yet to par­tic­i­pate in a full seven-a-side match.</p>
    <p>Their next in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion is likely the Asian In­door and Martial Arts Games in Thai­land next May. Aqi­lah, 24, said: “It’s been tough and it’s get­ting drain­ing men­tally as well be­cause you’re train­ing to­wards noth­ing this year so it feels a bit ‘sian’ (hokkien for frus­trat­ing).</p>
    <p>“But we keep re­mind­ing each other that it’s for next year.”</p>
    <p>It is a sim­i­lar story of frus­tra­tion for Ku­maresa Pa­su­pa­thy, 24, a mem­ber of lo­cal floor­ball club Black Won­der­sticks. He said: “It’s chal­leng­ing be­cause we train only in small groups and there’s no end goal in mind be­cause we don’t know when the league is go­ing to start.</p>
    <p>“It’s men­tally chal­leng­ing to keep our­selves mo­ti­vated – even th­ese small ses­sions de­mand ex­cel­lence – but at the end of the day, that’s what sport teaches us also.”</p>
    <p>His na­tional t eam­mate Gary Wong also high­lighted how from to­day, large cin­ema halls with more than 300 seats will be al­lowed to ad­mit up to 150 pa­trons.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old added: “I find it quite weird be­cause there’s close con­tact in the cin­ema too, and at hawker cen­tres there are a lot of peo­ple also.</p>
    <p>“But when it comes to sports, peo­ple are more wary about it, so it def­i­nitely puz­zles me.”</p>
    <p>No­rani Zaini, gen­eral man­ager of the Black Won­der­sticks and owner of the Youth Floor­ball Academy, noted that at­tri­tion was a real con­cern, ex­plain­ing: “With no com­pe­ti­tions, play­ers may stop com­ing for train­ing be­cause they’re more focused on work and they may think they’re train­ing for no rea­son this year.”</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert Leong Hoe Nam noted that, con­sid­er­ing Sin­ga­pore has done well in man­ag­ing the spread of Covid-19 and with few com­mu­nity cases in re­cent weeks, the re­sump­tion of a broader range of sports and com­pe­ti­tions could be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>This, he said, could be done with the ap­pli­ca­tion of basic mea­sures. “Ex­er­cise, no mask. Pre- and pos­tex­er­cise, use a mask and it is fine. And if any­one is sick, don’t play.”</p>
    <p>I un­der­stand that be­cause sport in­volves con­tact, there is some con­cern. But (sports com­pe­ti­tion) has re­sumed in other places with­out se­ri­ous es­ca­la­tion of the health sit­u­a­tion.</p>

    <p>It’s been tough and it’s get­ting drain­ing men­tally as well be­cause you’re train­ing to­wards noth­ing this year so it feels a bit ‘sian’.</p>
