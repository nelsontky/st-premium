    <p>Start­ing a clean­ing firm might not have been up­per­most on the minds of many busi­ness­men a while back, but en­tre­pre­neur Alvin Tan is now reap­ing the re­wards as the Covid-19 out­break sparks a huge de­mand for such ser­vices and prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, the founder and manag­ing di­rec­tor of Sure­clean, is see­ing the pay­off from in­vest­ing in the busi­ness over the years, while also putting his money in other firms that have sta­ble track records and po­ten­tial for growth in these volatile times.</p>
    <p>Sure­clean pro­duces child-safe hy­giene prod­ucts for the child­care, hos­pi­tal­ity and food and bev­er­age sec­tors, multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions and govern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, 41, started the busi­ness in 2013 with $25,000 that was con­trib­uted by his fam­ily. The com­pany broke even within the first year of op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>He says: “There was a lot of ini­tial re­jec­tions and hard­ships, but we did our best to over­come them as a team and got many cus­tomers to start us­ing our prod­ucts and ser­vices.”</p>
    <p>He has about 30 staff, rang­ing from of­fice work­ers to de­liv­ery per­son­nel, as well as teams of clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion spe­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>While a clean­ing com­pany might sound like a tra­di­tional busi­ness, Mr Tan says the firm’s fo­cus is al­ways on in­no­va­tion and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“We in­vest in our staff to up­grade their skill sets. We have in­vested in dif­fer­ent tech­nolo­gies over the past years and this has added value to our busi­ness op­er­a­tions since. We are ever evolv­ing, and in­no­va­tion is part of our strat­egy for growth.”</p>
    <p>The fu­ture is also bright for the in­dus­try, with the market size for in­fec­tion-preven­tion busi­nesses es­ti­mated at US$98.4 bil­lion (S$133.2 bil­lion) last year and an­tic­i­pated to ex­pand at a com­pound an­nual growth rate of 7.2 per cent un­til 2026, he notes.</p>
    <p>“Thus, we have al­ways set our sights on grow­ing over­seas as the Sin­ga­pore market has been a com­pet­i­tive, yet lim­ited one,” he says.</p>
    <p>“As hy­giene and dis­in­fec­tion are be­com­ing in­creas­ingly huge in (peo­ple’s) aware­ness due to the pan­demic, we have re­newed our ef­forts to in­crease our foot­print over­seas via fran­chis­ing and dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>“The next phase of growth would be se­lect­ing and work­ing with mul­ti­ple busi­ness or­gan­i­sa­tions all over the world to bring our dis­in­fec­tion tech­nol­ogy to their coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan holds a de­gree in in­for­ma­tion sys­tems from the Univer­sity of West­ern Syd­ney. He is mar­ried to Ms Clau­dia Canavarro, 35, who is Por­tuguese, and they have a oneyear-old son.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>A As I am rel­a­tively am­a­teur in in­vest­ing, I do keep my port­fo­lio sim­ple. Since the Covid-19 out­break, I have read­justed my hold­ings and cur­rently they are 60 per cent cash and 40 per cent in var­i­ous equities and funds.</p>
    <p>As I be­lieve the worst is yet to come for the pan­demic and there are still un­cer­tain­ties in the fu­ture, keep­ing 60 per cent in cash en­ables me to in­vest when the tim­ing and market con­di­tions are more favourable.</p>
    <p>I also hold 60 per cent of in­vest­ments in Amer­i­can equities and 40 per cent in lo­cal ones.</p>
    <p>My Amer­i­can equities are mostly in growth tech­nol­ogy stocks such as Google, Face­book, Net­flix, Shopify, Tesla, Adobe, Pay­Pal, Sales­force and Ap­ple. I se­lected com­pa­nies with com­pet­i­tive global ad­van­tages and busi­ness mod­els that I un­der­stood, or ser­vices that I used. The ad­di­tional cri­te­rion now is that they have to be rel­a­tively not im­pacted by the pan­demic in the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>My Sin­ga­pore hold­ings are mostly in real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits) such as Kep­pel DC, a data cen­tre Reit, med­i­cal Reits such as First and Park­wayLife, and lo­gis­tics and in­dus­trial Reits such as ARA Lo­gos, Frasers Lo­gis­tics and Com­mer­cial and Maple­tree In­dus­trial and Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>I se­lected com­pa­nies that are also less im­pacted by the pan­demic, so they should be able to con­tinue their div­i­dend pay­outs for a con­sis­tent in­come flow.</p>
    <p>Some of the in­vest­ments that I am still look­ing into are ex­change­traded funds (ETFs). I cur­rently hold SPY, which tracks the S&P500, with an av­er­age an­nu­alised re­turn of 13 per cent over the last 10 years, and one of the low­est ex­pense ra­tios at 0.0945 per cent.</p>
    <p>The other ETF I own is GLD, which tracks gold prices, and can form a hedge dur­ing these un­cer­tain times. I have ap­prox­i­mately 5 per cent of my port­fo­lio in GLD.</p>
    <p>I also have a mix­ture of whole life in­sur­ance poli­cies that cover death, dis­abil­ity and crit­i­cal ill­ness. Term in­sur­ance cov­ers me against death and dis­abil­ity at $1 mil­lion so that in the un­for­tu­nate event of death or dis­abil­ity, my fam­ily will be well taken care of.</p>
    <p>I also have the most com­pre­hen­sive hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion in­sur­ance for any un­fore­seen med­i­cal cir­cum­stances. Most of the poli­cies I have are with Pru­den­tial.</p>
    <p>As for prop­er­ties, I live in a three­room con­do­minium in the west of the is­land with my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>I have re­cently also pur­chased a com­mer­cial prop­erty as I was look­ing for a newer of­fice space for my busi­ness. It was ap­prox­i­mately 25 per cent be­low cur­rent val­u­a­tion, thus I quickly pur­chased it.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age re­turn for my port­fo­lio is es­ti­mated to be 9 per cent to 10 per cent an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A I got into in­vest­ing more than 10 years ago. I have been learn­ing dif­fer­ent in­vest­ment styles such as value in­vest­ing, in­come or div­i­dend in­vest­ing, for­eign ex­change trad­ing and even op­tions trad­ing.</p>
    <p>Over the years I have learnt about my in­di­vid­ual in­vest­ment style, thus I have elim­i­nated the ways that did not work for me over time.</p>
    <p>Now I com­bine a good sense of fi­nan­cial analysis to iden­tify sound com­pa­nies to buy into, and do my own due dili­gence to con­duct tech­ni­cal analysis on when to en­ter that par­tic­u­lar in­vest­ment. My per­sonal analysis is not to try to pre­dict the market but in­vest care­fully and go with the flow of what the market tells you. To man­age risk, I usu­ally have an ex­tremely strict stop-loss of 10 per cent when in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>Another im­por­tant in­vest­ment prin­ci­ple I fol­low is not to have more than 10 per cent in any one eq­uity in my in­vested port­fo­lio. This is re­ally im­por­tant to note as any un­fore­seen cir­cum­stance can hit a com­pany, which can af­fect its stock price neg­a­tively and quickly.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan? A My wife and I have a strict sav­ings pol­icy for our son’s ed­u­ca­tion fund. Both of us put aside $2,000 each per month into this fund, and have also con­sis­tently in­vested the funds into an ETF, which will be kept till it is re­quired for his ed­u­ca­tion when he turns 18.</p>
    <p>I wrote my will some time ago and it pro­vides in­struc­tions and con­di­tions for which my ex­ecu­tor will take to build an in­vest­ment trust, which will be dis­trib­uted to my fam­ily mem­bers in a fair man­ner.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A My con­tin­u­ous in­vest­ment ef­forts will carry on till re­tire­ment and I will even­tu­ally shift my port­fo­lio into a more pas­sive in­come-gen­er­at­ing one that suits a re­tire­ment life­style. I do not think I will (fully) re­tire. To some ex­tent I am pas­sion­ate, and I do like run­ning a busi­ness as it keeps me busy. How­ever, when the time comes, I might slow down to en­joy life with my fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>Q Money­wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My mother was a com­pany sec­re­tary for most of her life. She has since re­tired as a house­wife.</p>
    <p>I lost my fa­ther at a very early age. My mother sin­gle-hand­edly brought both my brother and me up. She was ex­tremely fru­gal and hard-work­ing, trav­el­ling long dis­tances for her work and com­ing home to do house­work.</p>
    <p>I am ex­tremely ap­pre­cia­tive and grate­ful for my mother’s sac­ri­fices she has en­dured through­out her whole life. She has also been 100 per cent sup­port­ive when I started my busi­ness and has been my most im­por­tant sup­port sys­tem since.</p>
    <p>As we were not from a well-off fam­ily, my brother worked hard to sup­port the fam­ily and was the sole bread­win­ner of the fam­ily at an early stage of his ca­reer, for which I am for­ever grate­ful.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now ...</p>
    <p>A A three-bed­room, 1,300 sq ft con­do­minium in the west.</p>
    <p>Q I drive ...</p>
    <p>A A Toy­ota Noah Pearl White as it is a more fam­ily-friendly car where we can fit baby seats and ac­com­mo­date more fam­ily mem­bers in the car at one time. It is more func­tional and multi-pur­pose for my cur­rent phase of life.</p>
