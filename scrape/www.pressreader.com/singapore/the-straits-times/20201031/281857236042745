    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO, WASH­ING­TON • Face­book chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zucker­berg said the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Tues­day will be a test of four years of work and ad­just­ment by the so­cial net­work to root out for­eign in­ter­fer­ence, voter sup­pres­sion, calls for vi­o­lence and more.</p>
    <p>“Next week will cer­tainly be a test for Face­book,” he added in a con­fer­ence call on Thurs­day to dis­cuss quar­terly earn­ings.</p>
    <p>“Elec­tion in­tegrity is and will be an on­go­ing chal­lenge. And I’m proud of the work that we have done here.”</p>
    <p>His com­pany has faced in­tense crit­i­cism since the 2016 elec­tion, when Rus­sian oper­a­tives used Face­book and In­sta­gram to cir­cu­late mis­in­for­ma­tion and stoke dis­cord – ef­forts that took months to dis­cover.</p>
    <p>Mr Zucker­berg said the com­pany has come a long way since then, tak­ing down 100 sim­i­lar co­or­di­nated net­works from Rus­sia, China, Iran and else­where, and has built bet­ter sys­tems to de­tect fake iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>The com­pany sought to close loop­holes in data shar­ing that were re­vealed in the scan­dal over Cam­bridge An­a­lyt­ica, the con­sult­ing firm that in 2016 used tar­get­ing data im­prop­erly ob­tained from Face­book quizzes.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, Face­book has got more di­rectly in­volved in what kind of con­tent its users see, en­cour­ag­ing mil­lions to sign up to vote and di­rect­ing peo­ple to an in­for­ma­tion cen­tre with ver­i­fied de­tails from elec­tion of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Still, with 2.74 bil­lion monthly users, the so­cial net­work will likely find it hard to stay ahead of all the ways its plat­forms could be used by bad ac­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Zucker­berg pre­dicted vi­o­lence could come from some of the groups that have or­gan­ised on Face­book and were re­moved only re­cently.</p>
    <p>“I’m wor­ried that with our na­tion so di­vided, and elec­tion re­sults po­ten­tially tak­ing days or weeks to be fi­nalised, there’s a risk of civil un­rest across the coun­try,” he said on the call. “Given this, com­pa­nies like ours need to go well be­yond what we’ve done be­fore.”</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Face­bookowned In­sta­gram said it was mak­ing changes to its im­age-shar­ing plat­form to pre­vent the spread of mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>For users in the US, In­sta­gram will tem­po­rar­ily re­move the “Re­cent” tab from hash­tag pages start­ing on Thurs­day, it said in a state­ment on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“We’re do­ing this to re­duce the real-time spread of po­ten­tially harm­ful con­tent that could pop up around the elec­tion,” the state­ment added. In­sta­gram’s “Re­cent” tab ar­ranges hash­tags in chrono­log­i­cal or­der and am­pli­fies con­tent.</p>
    <p>FEAR OF CIVIL UN­REST</p>
    <p>I’m wor­ried that with our na­tion so di­vided, and elec­tion re­sults po­ten­tially tak­ing days or weeks to be fi­nalised, there’s a risk of civil un­rest across the coun­try. Given this, com­pa­nies like ours need to go well be­yond what we’ve done be­fore.</p>
