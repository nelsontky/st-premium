        <p>The Sin­ga­pore econ­omy is likely to stage a slow re­cov­ery in the sec­ond half of this year, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day as he gave his out­look for 2021.</p>
        <p>This is in line with the global con­sen­sus that the world’s econ­omy may re­cover in the sec­ond half of the year as a re­sult of vac­ci­na­tion programmes that have kicked off, giv­ing hope that the pan­demic can be bet­ter con­trolled, he added.</p>
        <p>“Even then, the world has lost a sig­nif­i­cant part of its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, and even if that sce­nario pans out, it will still likely be be­low the 2019 level. So that is the sce­nario that we have to plan on,” said Mr Heng at The Straits Times Global Out­look Fo­rum.</p>
        <p>He was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from the mod­er­a­tor, Straits Times edi­tor War­ren Fer­nan­dez, on his forecast for the econ­omy this year amid the un­cer­tainty that has roiled mar­kets in the past year.</p>
        <p>Mr Heng said the way to deal with un­cer­tainty is to as­sess what is the most likely, or cen­tral, sce­nario for the econ­omy, and then to look at the po­ten­tial up­sides which may give sur­prises and the pos­si­ble down­sides to pre­pare for.</p>
        <p>“In the case of the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy... our cen­tral sce­nario is that we may see that the first half will still not be very good. The sec­ond half, we may be­gin to see some uptick in ac­tiv­i­ties,” he said at the an­nual con­fer­ence or­gan­ised by The Straits Times, in part­ner­ship with pre­sent­ing spon­sor OCBC Premier Bank­ing, and held on­line.</p>
        <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, cited the vac­ci­na­tion drives go­ing on around the world and the global con­sen­sus that the world econ­omy may re­cover in the sec­ond half of this year.</p>
        <p>A po­ten­tial pos­i­tive fac­tor could be vac­ci­na­tion ef­forts turn­ing out to be very ef­fec­tive across the world, al­low­ing it to over­come the Covid-19 pan­demic, he said.</p>
        <p>Pos­si­ble down­sides in­clude ten­sions be­tween the United States and China es­ca­lat­ing – which will have a “damp­en­ing ef­fect” on the global econ­omy – and vac­cines not work­ing as well as ex­pected.</p>
        <p>“And, of course, there could be some other events that could in­ter­vene in the mean­while, so we have to keep our minds open and watch for new risks that could emerge,” he added.</p>
        <p>Mr Fer­nan­dez, who is also edi­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group, asked whether Mr Heng was more op­ti­mistic for the com­ing year.</p>
        <p>On the econ­omy, Mr Heng said: “My cen­tral sce­nario is that this year will be bet­ter than last year.”</p>
        <p>He pointed out how new variants of the virus have emerged, and how new out­breaks have led to a resur­gence of in­fec­tions in places that had done well to con­trol the virus ini­tially.</p>
        <p>“It is not some­thing that we can wish away, so I would say we need to take a very re­al­is­tic ap­proach to this,” he said.</p>
        <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on the five Bud­gets that had to be an­nounced over the past year as the pan­demic took its toll on busi­nesses and peo­ple, Mr Heng noted that he ad­dressed Par­lia­ment nine times over the past year. “My wish for this year is one Bud­get,” he said.</p>
        <p>Asked about pos­i­tives from Sin­ga­pore’s ex­pe­ri­ence with tack­ling the pan­demic, Mr Heng cited the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force set up to study eco­nomic changes ac­cel­er­ated by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
        <p>The task force adopted a “very dif­fer­ent ap­proach” by es­tab­lish­ing Al­liances for Ac­tion, which brought to­gether in­dus­try lead­ers, union rep­re­sen­ta­tives and gov­ern­ment agen­cies on top­ics such as sus­tain­abil­ity and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
        <p>In the longer term, Sin­ga­pore will need to grap­ple with two key chal­lenges, Mr Heng added.</p>
        <p>A rapidly age­ing population means it will have to look at how it can con­tinue to take good care of se­niors. The coun­try must also fo­cus on how to help younger Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­cess op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
        <p>This means that part of Sin­ga­pore’s re­search agenda will go be­yond hu­man health to fo­cus on hu­man po­ten­tial, Mr Heng said.</p>
        <p>“So am I more op­ti­mistic?” he added. “I’ll say that, well, we just need to have a sort of fairly ro­bust at­ti­tude and hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst.”</p>
