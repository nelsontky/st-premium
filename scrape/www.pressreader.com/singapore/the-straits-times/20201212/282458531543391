    <p>RACE 1 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>11 Win­ning Brew has the ex­pe­ri­ence to be very com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>6 Master Mon­taro has caught the eye at the tri­als. He also has a solid re­sume from Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>2 Sun­set Watch has been in solid form. He looks ready to go on with it.</p>
    <p>14 Hello Beauty is con­sis­tent. He goes in light with no weight on his back.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>1 Joy­ful Heart is suited by the drop to Class 4. He also gets the ser­vices of cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>2 Nordic War­rior ran a blinder last start. He will go close again.</p>
    <p>3 Ul­ti­mate Glory rarely runs a bad race.</p>
    <p>12 Stun­ning Im­pact is get­ting close to a win. With an in­side draw and a handy weight, he can prove hard to catch.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>3 En­rich­ment is rac­ing well. Bri­tish ace Ryan Moore will get the best out of him. The draw suits.</p>
    <p>11 Che­va­lier Prince was an im­pres­sive sec­ond-up win­ner last start. He should rel­ish the ex­tra 200m. 10 Beauty An­gel is look­ing for his fifth con­sec­u­tive win. He can achieve it from the good draw.</p>
    <p>2 Char­ity Go rarely runs a bad race. He only needs to over­come the wide bar­rier.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (2,400M)</p>
    <p>LONGINES HONG KONG VASE</p>
    <p>4 Colum­bus County fin­ished nicely last start for third at his first try at Group 2 level. A young horse open to plenty of im­prove­ment, he can sur­prise.</p>
    <p>1 Ex­ul­tant is ar­guably the one to beat as a proven 2,400m horse. But, while he man­aged to fin­ish gamely last start, he needs to step up to run his ri­vals into the ground. 7 Mogul won the Group 1 Grand Prix de Paris over this dis­tance two starts ago. A lead­ing player.</p>
    <p>3 Ho Ho Khan is next best, as a course-and-dis­tance win­ner.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>LONGINES HONG KONG SPRINT</p>
    <p>9 Rat­tan, a slow starter, could fin­ish the strong­est if he gets a fast pace.</p>
    <p>2 Hot King Prawn is a last-start win­ner in the Group 2 Jockey Club Sprint. He is drawn to get the run of the race. Top chance.</p>
    <p>1 Clas­sique Leg­end, the win­ner of the A$15 mil­lion (S$15 mil­lion) The Ever­est last start, has to ac­cli­ma­tise to his new en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>4 Voy­age War­rior is build­ing into this con­test nicely. He was a luck­less fourth in his most re­cent run.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>10 Pure Leg­end is rac­ing well. He is the one to beat, if he can off­set the awk­ward al­ley.</p>
    <p>12 True Leg­end slots in light but is ham­pered by the tricky draw. His rider, Alexis Badel, is rid­ing in great form.</p>
    <p>13 Ex­cep­tional Nice has per­formed well in three starts. Fur­ther im­prove­ment is ex­pected.</p>
    <p>1 Heza Beauty has a weight-bear­ing task but has drawn favourably.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>LONGINES HONG KONG MILE</p>
    <p>2 Golden Sixty is Hong Kong’s ris­ing su­per­star, with 13 wins – the last 10 in a row – from 14 starts. But this will be his tough­est test.</p>
    <p>6 Waikuku, sec­ond last year, re­turns first-up, which suits. He prefers to run fresh.</p>
    <p>3 Ad­mire Mars won this race last year. He brings high-class Ja­panese form with him.</p>
    <p>1 Beauty Gen­er­a­tion, the old cham­pion, has had a freshen-up and can score if back at his best.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (2,000M)</p>
    <p>LONGINES HONG KONG CUP</p>
    <p>4 Furore was dom­i­nant in his last two runs at Group 2 level. He is peak­ing at the right time. Great chance on home ground.</p>
    <p>3 Win Bright is two from two over 2,000m at Sha Tin at Group 1 level, in­clud­ing this race last year. The horse just seems to love the track.</p>
    <p>7 Mag­i­cal is top Ir­ish trainer Ai­dan O’Brien’s su­per mare. Bri­tish ace Moore can get her right in it.</p>
    <p>2 Danon Pre­mium is as solid as they come. He can be at the fin­ish.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>3 Win­ning Dreamer is aim­ing for a sixth straight win. He owns a slick per­sonal best over this course and dis­tance.</p>
    <p>6 Sky Field is a big tal­ent suited to sprint­ing. He is ca­pa­ble of bounc­ing back with the good draw.</p>
    <p>1 Duke Wai has class, but needs to get the right run.</p>
    <p>10 Beauty Ap­plause is a young tal­ent. The draw and hand­i­cap suit. He will look the win­ner a long way from home.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>4 The Sum­mit, a French im­port who placed twice at Group 1 level as a three-year-old, has tri­alled well for his Hong Kong de­but.</p>
    <p>5 Shadow Hero, a dual Aus­tralian Group 1 win­ner, was aw­fully un­lucky on de­but. He will im­prove.</p>
    <p>6 Su­per Wealthy drops back from Class 1 to Class 2. He needs a run to suit but is worth in­clud­ing.</p>
    <p>2 Su­per Oa­sis is next best, if he can off­set the awk­ward draw.</p>
