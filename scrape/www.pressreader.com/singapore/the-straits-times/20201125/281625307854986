    <p>For­tu­nately for Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, who wants to hold a global sum­mit for democ­racy in his first year in of­fice, the United States has squeaked through the most acute test of its democ­racy in modern times.</p>
    <p>The idea of the sum­mit, ac­cord­ing to his cam­paign man­i­festo, is to “bring to­gether the world’s democ­ra­cies to strengthen our demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions, hon­estly con­front the chal­lenge of na­tions that are back­slid­ing, and forge a com­mon agenda to ad­dress threats to our com­mon val­ues”.</p>
    <p>There is some scep­ti­cism abroad – for in­stance, over whether that would leave out coun­tries with com­mu­nist or hy­brid sys­tems, like Viet­nam or Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, Mr Bi­den would have to restore con­fi­dence that democ­racy is work­ing in the US it­self, af­ter four years of the Don­ald Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, dur­ing which in­ter­na­tional im­pres­sions of the US nose­dived.</p>
    <p>“The world re­mains split about whether the US’ global in­flu­ence has a pos­i­tive or neg­a­tive in­flu­ence on democ­racy around the world: 44 per cent say it has a pos­i­tive in­flu­ence, 38 per cent say neg­a­tive,” ac­cord­ing to Dalia Re­search’s Democ­racy Per­cep­tion In­dex 2020.</p>
    <p>The stresses on democ­racy were many, with Mr Trump con­stantly un­der­min­ing the in­sti­tu­tions nec­es­sary for a func­tion­ing state. He cast the ri­val Demo­cratic Party, the me­dia, as well as of­fice-hold­ers in his own gov­ern­ment who were crit­i­cal of him, as en­e­mies of the peo­ple – and his sup­port­ers largely be­lieved it.</p>
    <p>He cast doubt, with­out any ba­sis, on the in­tegrity of the elec­tion – and his sup­port­ers largely be­lieved him. And it is clear that the test is not quite over yet.</p>
    <p>“Trump vot­ers, who al­ready were scep­ti­cal of the elec­toral process and prospects for an ac­cu­rate vote count be­fore the elec­tion in Oc­to­ber, have be­come much more so since Bi­den’s vic­tory,” said a Pew Re­search sur­vey re­leased last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“While a 59 per cent ma­jor­ity of all vot­ers say elec­tions in the United States were run and ad­min­is­tered well, just 21 per cent of Trump sup­port­ers have a pos­i­tive view of how elec­tions were ad­min­is­tered na­tion­ally. Among Bi­den sup­port­ers, 94 per cent say the elec­tions were run and ad­min­is­tered well.”</p>
    <p>Still, not­with­stand­ing the un­prece­dented stress of a deadly pan­demic, a se­verely po­larised so­ci­ety prone to pro­pa­ganda and dis­in­for­ma­tion, and un­rest over racial jus­tice and eco­nomic in­equal­ity, an in­de­pen­dent ju­di­ciary handed down court de­ci­sions that went against the Pres­i­dent’s at­tempts to al­ter the re­sult of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“There are... em­bed­ded in­sti­tu­tions, which have at least a very highly in­de­pen­dent ex­is­tence,” said Dr In­der­jeet Par­mar, pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics at the City, Univer­sity of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“Trump’s un­der­stand­ing, from the cul­ture of the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion, is that he em­ploys you – you are per­son­ally loyal to him. But in the gov­ern­ment sys­tem, you are ap­pointed as a judge and you are a judge – you are not a po­lit­i­cal hack.”</p>
    <p>The elec­tion process also with­stood the pres­sure, he said.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials and vol­un­teers “went to work, col­lected bal­lots, over­saw the process. Ev­ery­thing is laid out, there’s not much au­ton­omy. At the gran­u­lar level at which votes are counted, that stood up pretty strongly”.</p>
    <p>But democ­racy sur­vived only by the skin of its teeth, warned Dr Glenn Altschuler, pro­fes­sor of Amer­i­can stud­ies at Cor­nell Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“It has been a very close call and one that has dam­aged democ­racy, both within the United States and to peo­ple around the world who had viewed the United States as a bea­con of demo­cratic prac­tice,” Dr Altschuler told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“It has de­pended on a small num­ber of in­di­vid­u­als who re­sisted the en­treaties, the pres­sure, the de­mands from a pres­i­dent of the United States who has been known to pun­ish his en­e­mies,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is a re­lief… but it is a deep cause of con­cern that the hy­per­par­ti­san­ship that brought on this cri­sis is not go­ing away any time soon,” he added.</p>
    <p>“And we now have the prece­dent for chal­leng­ing an elec­tion, even (with) no ev­i­dence of fraud or malfea­sance or wrong­do­ing.”</p>
