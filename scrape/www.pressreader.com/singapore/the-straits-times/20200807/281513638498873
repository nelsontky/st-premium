    <p>It was all quiet at Jurong Lake Gar­dens yes­ter­day evening, but at around 8.20pm on Sun­day, the sky above will be awash with colour as fire­works mark the cli­max of Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions. The site is one of 10 across the is­land which will host five-minute fire­work dis­plays. The lo­ca­tions have been picked to al­low as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble to view the dis­plays from their homes.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic will be able to en­joy fire­works dis­plays for Na­tional Day at 10 dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions across the is­land this year.</p>
    <p>They are in: Ang Mo Kio, Bis­han, Buona Vista, Jurong Lake Gar­dens, Ma­rina Reser­voir, Pung­gol, Sem­bawang, Tampines, Wood­lands and Yew Tee. Res­i­dents in neigh­bour­ing es­tates may be able to view the fire­works from their homes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the or­gan­is­ers said they could not dis­close spe­cific lo­ca­tions, to pre­vent crowds gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The dis­plays will last for around five min­utes and be­gin si­mul­ta­ne­ously at around 8.20pm af­ter the Pledge Mo­ment, at the end of the Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) evening show to be held at the Star Vista.</p>
    <p>Colonel Lek Seng Khoon, deputy chair­man of the NDP2020 Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mit­tee and chair­man of the NDP2020 Safety and Se­cu­rity Com­mit­tee, said at a me­dia con­fer­ence yes­ter­day: “It is our in­tent to bring the show and the NDP ex­pe­ri­ence to</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, so that we can max­imise the view­er­ship of Sin­ga­pore­ans and share the NDP ex­pe­ri­ence with as many Sin­ga­pore­ans as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The fire­works will have an ef­fec­tive vis­i­ble range of 1km to 8km and will burst at a height be­tween 15 and 62 storeys, so as to be vis­i­ble from peo­ple’s homes.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing con­cerns about fire­works in HDB es­tates, the chair­man of the NDP2020 Fire­works Se­cu­rity Com­mit­tee, Lieu­tenan­tColonel Michael En­riquez, said there is an “im­me­di­ate safety ra­dius around the fir­ing site, which can range from less than 100m for smaller fire­works sites to more than 400m (for larger ones) to ad­dress the safety of the pub­lic and the per­son­nel on the ground”.</p>
    <p>About 2,000 per­son­nel from the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF), Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force and Ae­tos, along with safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and en­force­ment of­fi­cers, will be de­ployed across the is­land to en­sure ad­her­ence to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures for NDP-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Start­ing the cel­e­bra­tions on Sun­day will be the SAF’s Red Lions para­chute team, which will land near the Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal in Jurong East and the Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal at around 9am in a trib­ute to front lin­ers bat­tling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A scaled-down pa­rade will take place at the Padang, the state flag will be flown by heli­copters across Sin­ga­pore via two routes, six F-15 fighter jets will fly across the is­land and a mo­bile col­umn will travel along five routes.</p>
    <p>Said Col Lek: “The con­cept of this year’s NDP is to bring the NDP ex­pe­ri­ence into the homes of Sin­ga­pore­ans. As such, many of the events will be brought into the heart­land... and broad­cast live on TV.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to cel­e­brate Na­tional Day with their fam­i­lies at home. In the event that they wish to go out... we urge that you put on a mask and ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing. To­gether, we can make this NDP memorable and safe.”</p>
