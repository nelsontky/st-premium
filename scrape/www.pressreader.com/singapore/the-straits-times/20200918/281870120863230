    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has been quick to leave his mark on his lead­er­ship, vow­ing to push through re­forms to un­clog the gov­ern­ment’s no­to­ri­ous in­ef­fi­cien­cies even as he pur­sues the bulk of poli­cies started by his pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Shinzo Abe.</p>
    <p>The em­pha­sis on re­form was high­lighted by Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato yes­ter­day, who said one of the new gov­ern­ment’s pri­or­i­ties was to “do away with sec­tion­al­ism in gov­ern­ment agen­cies and elim­i­nate fol­low­ing prece­dents for their own sake”.</p>
    <p>The re­form pledges at the top have been re­ceived warmly by the pub­lic, even though Mr Suga in­cluded many ex­pe­ri­enced peo­ple and ap­pointed just five rook­ies to his team of 20 Cabi­net min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>A poll by Kyodo News yes­ter­day showed 66.4 per cent of Ja­panese sup­port Mr Suga, and just 16.2 per cent dis­ap­prove. An­other poll, by Nikkei and TV Tokyo, showed sup­port for the Cabi­net at 74 per cent, the third-high­est re­sult for any Cabi­net at its de­but.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, in Yamaguchi pre­fec­ture, Mr Abe’s home town, 158 com­plaints were yes­ter­day sent to the lo­cal gov­ern­ment of­fice over the mis­use of tax­pay­ers’ money for ban­ners cel­e­brat­ing his record-long ten­ure.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing the charge for re­form is Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­form Min­is­ter Taro Kono, 57, renowned as an out­spo­ken mav­er­ick politi­cian with a his­tory of pro­duc­ing re­sults.</p>
    <p>The post has typ­i­cally been seen as a to­ken port­fo­lio, with few suc­cesses, in past Cab­i­nets. But ex­pec­ta­tions are high that Mr Kono can make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>A poll by the Mainichi Shim­bun yes­ter­day showed that 76 per cent of re­spon­dents sup­ported Mr Kono’s ap­point­ment as ad­min­is­tra­tive re­form chief, a post he last held from 2015 to 2016.</p>
    <p>At the time, he pushed for re­views of ad­min­is­tra­tive work and slashed 100 bil­lion yen (S$1.3 bil­lion) from nu­clear power bud­gets. The Yomi­uri Shim­bun quoted a civil ser­vant as say­ing: “He was scarier than the op­po­si­tion par­ties.”</p>
    <p>He also ruf­fled feath­ers in June, when, as de­fence min­is­ter, he al­most uni­lat­er­ally de­cided to ditch the pricey yet in­ef­fec­tive and un­safe Aegis Ashore mis­sile de­fence sys­tem with­out con­sult­ing his col­leagues in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>And while it has been an un­spo­ken tra­di­tion for ev­ery sin­gle min­is­ter to hold a news con­fer­ence at the Cabi­net Of­fice af­ter the first Cabi­net meet­ing, he made his dis­plea­sure clear when it fi­nally got to his turn at 1am yes­ter­day. “Ev­ery­thing lacks speed in this coun­try. We would all be at home and asleep by now if min­is­ters could speak at their own venues. Such non­sense can and should be re­duced,” he said.</p>
    <p>How far Mr Kono even­tu­ally man­ages to dis­man­tle the sec­tion­al­ism and blind fol­low­ing of prece­dents that Mr Suga wants to get rid of re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>He has been quick off the blocks – al­ready launch­ing a form on his web­site ask­ing for “feed­back on use­less and in­ef­fi­cient reg­u­la­tions that hin­der pro­duc­tiv­ity”, a call that “extends to civil ser­vants in Ka­sum­i­gaseki”, he said, re­fer­ring to the district where gov­ern­ment agen­cies are con­cen­trated.</p>
    <p>He is ex­pected to face a lot of en­trenched re­sis­tance along­side Dig­i­tal Min­is­ter Takuya Hi­rai, 62, who has been tasked with launch­ing an agency that will pro­mote pa­per­less gover­nance and cross-min­is­te­rial co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Among other things, driv­ers’ li­cences will be dig­i­talised. But the new gov­ern­ment al­ready has its first cy­ber-se­cu­rity chal­lenge:</p>
    <p>In a broad­en­ing e-money scam, 12 banks have been hit with fraud­u­lent with­drawals.</p>
    <p>Still, the dig­i­tal push is wel­comed by the busi­ness com­mu­nity. Sun­tory Hold­ings chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Tak Ni­inami said he hopes the new gov­ern­ment can go dig­i­tal as soon as pos­si­ble so as to achieve the “en­rich­ment of liveli­hoods by cre­at­ing a cir­cu­lar so­ci­ety through dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>While Mr Suga has denied that the ap­point­ment of Mr Kono, for­merly a for­eign and a de­fence min­is­ter, amounted to a de­mo­tion, an­a­lysts won­der oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>“What Suga did with Kono is al­most like what Abe did with (ri­val Shigeru) Ishiba, when he gave him the lo­cal re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion port­fo­lio,” said Sophia Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Koichi Nakano. “It is on pa­per an im­por­tant post, but the hur­dles are so high there is al­most no guar­an­tee of suc­cess.”</p>
    <p>Dr Michael Cucek of Tem­ple Univer­sity Ja­pan said Mr Kono is a po­ten­tial ri­val for the premier­ship. “Suga has given Kono a tough chal­lenge that will keep him oc­cu­pied, in­stead of... pre­par­ing for the next Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party pres­i­dency elec­tion next year.”</p>
