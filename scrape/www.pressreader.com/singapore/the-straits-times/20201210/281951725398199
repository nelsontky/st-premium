    <p>• De­spite calls for cease­fires and com­pas­sion amid the Covid-19 cri­sis, vi­o­lence and per­se­cu­tion have con­tin­ued to force peo­ple from their homes, with record num­bers now dis­placed, the United Na­tions said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>By the end of last year, 79.5 mil­lion peo­ple were liv­ing up­rooted and dis­placed, in­clud­ing nearly 30 mil­lion refugees – more than 1 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The UN refugee agency said pre­lim­i­nary data showed more peo­ple had been forced to flee this year, push­ing the num­ber past 80 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“We are now sur­pass­ing an­other bleak mile­stone that will con­tinue to grow un­less world lead­ers stop wars,” said the UN High Com­mis­sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Filippo Grandi.</p>
    <p>In March, UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral</p>
    <p>An­to­nio Guter­res called for a global cease­fire while the world fights Covid-19, which has now killed more than 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But while some fac­tions heeded the call, UNHCR said pre­lim­i­nary fig­ures through the first half of this year showed that vi­o­lence in Syria, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of the Congo, Mozam­bique, So­ma­lia and Ye­men drove fresh dis­place­ment.</p>
    <p>Africa’s cen­tral Sa­hel re­gion also saw sig­nif­i­cant new dis­place­ment due to bru­tal vi­o­lence, in­clud­ing rape and ex­e­cu­tions, it said.</p>
    <p>“With forced dis­place­ment dou­bling in the last decade, the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity is fail­ing to safe­guard peace,” Mr Grandi said.</p>
    <p>The UN agency pointed out that in­stead of calm­ing con­flict, the coro­n­avirus cri­sis had “dis­rupted ev­ery as­pect of hu­man life and se­verely wors­ened ex­ist­ing chal­lenges for the forcibly dis­placed and state­less”.</p>
    <p>It pointed out that some of the mea­sures to curb the spread of Covid-19 had made it more dif­fi­cult for refugees to reach safety.</p>
    <p>At the peak of the first wave of trans­mis­sion in April, 168 coun­tries fully or par­tially closed their bor­ders, in­clud­ing 90 that made no ex­cep­tion for asy­lum seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Since then, though, 111 coun­tries have found prag­matic so­lu­tions to en­sure asy­lum pro­cesses can re­main func­tional, UNHCR said.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, new asy­lum ap­pli­ca­tions dropped by a third dur­ing the first half of the year com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the num­ber of vul­ner­a­ble refugees re­set­tled to third coun­tries was slashed in half, to just 17,400 in the first half of the year.</p>
