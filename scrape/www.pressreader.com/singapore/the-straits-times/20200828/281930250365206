    <p>KENOSHA, WIS­CON­SIN • In­ves­ti­ga­tors of a shoot­ing in Wis­con­sin by a white po­lice of­fi­cer that left a black man, Mr Ja­cob Blake, paral­ysed found a knife be­long­ing to Mr Blake at the scene of the con­fronta­tion, the state at­tor­ney-gen­eral said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The shoot­ing sparked three nights of civil un­rest that has in­cluded a wave of ar­son, wide­spread van­dal­ism and a sep­a­rate shoot­ing that claimed two lives in Kenosha, a city of about 100,000 res­i­dents on Lake Michi­gan, 60km south of Mil­wau­kee.</p>
    <p>Face­book also said it re­moved a page for the Kenosha Guard, a group which had posted a “call to arms” in Kenosha, say­ing the page vi­o­lated its pol­icy against “mili­tia or­gan­i­sa­tions”.</p>
    <p>In the first of­fi­cial de­tails of Sun­day’s shoot­ing re­leased by the Wis­con­sin Jus­tice Depart­ment, which is prob­ing the in­ci­dent, At­tor­neyGen­eral Josh Kaul said the knife was re­cov­ered from the driver-side front floor­board of the car that Mr Blake was lean­ing into when he was shot in the back.</p>
    <p>Mr Kaul also told a news con­fer­ence that dur­ing the course of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, Mr Blake had “ad­mit­ted that he had a knife in his pos­ses­sion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Blake’s lawyer re­sponded in a state­ment that his client posed no threat to the po­lice and dis­puted that he was in pos­ses­sion of a knife.</p>
    <p>Mr Kaul did not de­scribe the knife or say whether it had any­thing to do with why the of­fi­cer – a seven-year vet­eran of the Kenosha Po­lice Depart­ment iden­ti­fied as Mr Rusten Sh­eskey – had opened fire on Mr Blake.</p>
    <p>Mr Kaul’s brief­ing came shortly be­fore the United States Jus­tice Depart­ment an­nounced it had opened a fed­eral civil rights in­quiry into the shoot­ing, to be con­ducted by the Fed­eral Bu­reau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion in co­op­er­a­tion with the Wis­con­sin au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate devel­op­ment hours ear­lier, a teenager was ar­rested and charged with shoot­ing three peo­ple, two of whom died, dur­ing Tues­day night’s protests in Kenosha.</p>
    <p>Video footage from that in­ci­dent shows a white gun­man, armed with an as­sault-style ri­fle, fir­ing at pro­test­ers who try to sub­due him, and then calmly walk­ing away from the scene – hands in the air and his ri­fle hang­ing in front of him – as sev­eral po­lice ve­hi­cles drive by with­out stop­ping him.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin Lieu­tenant-Gov­er­nor</p>
    <p>Man­dela Barnes told MSNBC that the sus­pect – later iden­ti­fied as Kyle Rit­ten­house, 17, from An­ti­och, Illi­nois – was ap­par­ently a mili­tia group mem­ber who “de­cided to be a vig­i­lante and take the law into his own hands and mow down in­no­cent pro­test­ers”.</p>
