    <p>Some res­i­dents are against the new pedes­trian code of con­duct drawn up by the Land Trans­port Author­ity that kicked in this month, but the code has also drawn sup­port from peo­ple who feel that en­sur­ing safety on pub­lic paths is a shared re­spon­si­bil­ity. There are no penal­ties im­posed on pedes­tri­ans who do not fol­low these rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate lec­turer Ce­leste Ng, 53, was walk­ing on the left side of a foot­path in Bukit Ba­tok re­cently when she spot­ted a cy­clist rid­ing towards her from the op­po­site di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>As the path on her right was clear, she de­cided to con­tinue walk­ing without step­ping aside. But the cy­clist was also un­will­ing to give way.</p>
    <p>“He swung to my right at the last minute and swore at me for not giv­ing way to him,” said Madam Ng, adding: “You tell me, should the code of con­duct be set for the cy­clist or for the pedes­trian? In no time, these cy­clists are going to chase us pedes­tri­ans out of our walk­way.”</p>
    <p>Madam Ng is among those who are against the new pedes­trian code of con­duct drawn up by the Land Trans­port Author­ity that kicked in this month.</p>
    <p>But the code has also drawn sup­port from peo­ple who feel that en­sur­ing safety on pub­lic paths is a shared re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The new code, for in­stance, tack­les one of Mr Lee Peng Hock’s con­cerns – pedes­tri­ans who have their eyes glued to their mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>The re­tired ship fi­nance con­sul­tant, 76, said: “They don’t un­der­stand the dan­gers posed by cy­clists, per­sonal mo­bil­ity devices and fast jog­gers.”</p>
    <p>The code makes four rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>First, a pedes­trian should stick to a foot­path if he or she has a choice be­tween walk­ing on that or a path shared with cy­clists.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, a pedes­trian should cross a road us­ing a pedes­trian cross­ing if he or she has a choice be­tween that and a bi­cy­cle cross­ing.</p>
    <p>Third, a pedes­trian walk­ing on a foot­path or shared path should keep as far left as pos­si­ble un­less he or she is over­tak­ing an­other pedes­trian.</p>
    <p>Lastly, pedes­tri­ans should stay alert and re­frain from us­ing their mo­bile devices in a way that will hin­der their abil­ity to de­tect dan­ger.</p>
    <p>There are no penal­ties im­posed on pedes­tri­ans who do not fol­low these sug­ges­tions, which were re­cently added to an ex­ist­ing code of con­duct for path users that had pre­vi­ously fo­cused on cy­clists and users of per­sonal mo­bil­ity devices.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences trans­port re­searcher Park Byung Joon said the code is “a tad overly de­fined”.</p>
    <p>“Imag­ine a 10-year-old boy is walk­ing with his younger sis­ters side by side. Some adult will yell at them to walk on the left... Isn’t it too dry?</p>
    <p>“I only see the side of ef­fi­ciency and safety. I did not feel any hu­man touch in the code.</p>
    <p>“It makes me a bit sad, ac­tu­ally.” Cy­cling group Love Cy­cling SG founder Fran­cis Chu said cy­clists should al­ways give way and keep a safe dis­tance from pedes­tri­ans, as stated in the code of con­duct for ac­tive mo­bil­ity de­vice users.</p>
    <p>“As a cy­clist, I want cy­cling to be so­cially ac­cepted. There are far more pedes­tri­ans than cy­clists. It doesn’t make sense to de­mand that such a large group adapt to the small, more ca­pa­ble group,” he added.</p>
    <p>Those who sup­port the code of con­duct say that pedes­tri­ans have a part to play in avoid­ing ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>IT se­cu­rity spe­cial­ist Sa­muel Yap, who is in his late 40s, said he has been tak­ing pre­cau­tions while walk­ing on pub­lic paths, such as keep­ing to one side and stay­ing alert as stated in the code.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he still feels there is a need for more en­force­ment against er­rant rid­ers and for a clearer de­mar­ca­tion of paths, where fea­si­ble, to fa­cil­i­tate safer path shar­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Robert Liew, di­rec­tor of arts pre­sen­ter Arts Man­age­ment As­so­ciates, who is in his early 70s, said he sup­ports guide­lines to fa­cil­i­tate more ef­fi­cient use of shared paths but noted that paths should be clearly marked to in­di­cate whether they are foot­paths or shared paths.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, there are not many vis­ually distinctiv­e paths around.”</p>
    <p>Dr Liew, who also rides bi­cy­cles and e-scoot­ers reg­u­larly, added that in­cul­cat­ing a greater sense of shar­ing and re­spon­si­bil­ity among path users would help im­prove safety. “Without mu­tual shar­ing... when con­di­tions al­low, we can never have a seam­less net­work,” he added.</p>
