    <p>MAR­SEILLE • Manch­ester City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola is con­fi­dent his team will find the con­sis­tency they need af­ter their 3-0 vic­tory at Mar­seille in the Cham­pi­ons League on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>City took con­trol of Group C with six points from two games, lead­ing Porto and Olympiakos by three points while Mar­seille are bot­tom of the ta­ble af­ter two de­feats.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s side have got­ten off to a slug­gish start in the Premier League, sit­ting in 13th place with eight points from five games, five be­hind lead­ers Ever­ton who have played a game more.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they look com­fort­able in Europe and the Spa­niard aims to carry over their Cham­pi­ons League form to the English top flight.</p>
    <p>“We have to ac­cept the crit­i­cism. We play ev­ery three days, when you win it’s good but if you don’t, peo­ple want to de­stroy every­thing. But it’s about the chair­man and ev­ery­one else un­der­stand­ing,” said Guardi­ola.</p>
    <p>“Part of the crit­i­cism was right, but you’ve got to ac­cept it. It’s part of our job.</p>
    <p>“It’s about where we’ve come from in the last month, with lack of prepa­ra­tion, in­juries and Covid-19 but the Cham­pi­ons League is in a good place now.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure we’re go­ing to find that con­sis­tency.”</p>
    <p>While Mar­seille proved to be easy op­po­nents, City were nev­er­the­less lively through­out and they made their dom­i­na­tion count and de­fended well when the hosts briefly threat­ened af­ter the break.</p>
    <p>Fer­ran Tor­res, Ilkay Gun­do­gan and Ra­heem Ster­ling scored for the vis­i­tors, with Guardi­ola hint­ing that Mar­seille’s five-man de­fence played into their hands.</p>
    <p>“We played re­ally well, we didn’t con­cede much and we were in con­trol, pa­tient and ag­gres­sive with­out the ball. I’m so sat­is­fied with the per­for­mance and re­sult, it’s al­ways dif­fi­cult to win away,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We can play on both sides, we tried to play high and wide to stretch the pitch. Ster­ling was ex­cep­tional, Phil (Fo­den) as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t ex­pect them to play five at the back un­til we saw the team.</p>
    <p>“Porto was the same. As much as we play against five at the back, we started to take the con­trol and rhythm.</p>
    <p>“We were so sta­ble de­fen­sively. I’m so sat­is­fied with the way we played.”</p>
