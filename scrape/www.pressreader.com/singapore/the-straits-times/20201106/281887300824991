    <p>Sin­ga­porean blog­ger Amos Yee, who was given asy­lum by the United States in 2017, was in­dicted by a grand jury in Illi­nois on Wed­nes­day and for­mally charged with solic­i­ta­tion and pos­ses­sion of child pornog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old will ap­pear in court again next Wed­nes­day for an ar­raign­ment – a pro­ceed­ing where he will be for­mally ad­vised of the charges against him, and asked to en­ter a plea to the charges.</p>
    <p>Yee ap­peared at the Leighton Crim­i­nal Court­house be­fore Judge Charles Beach and was rep­re­sented by a pub­lic de­fender as­signed to him by the Illi­nois courts.</p>
    <p>He has been liv­ing in Chicago since 2017, af­ter leav­ing Sin­ga­pore where he was jailed twice – in 2015 and 2016 – for wound­ing re­li­gious feel­ings.</p>
    <p>In Chicago, he al­legedly ex­changed nude photos and thou­sands of mes­sages with a 14-yearold Texas girl.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his bail hear­ing on Oct 16, the court heard that he had asked the girl for nude photos in their ex­changes be­tween April and July last year. He had also sent nude pic­tures of him­self to her.</p>
    <p>His bail was set at US$1 mil­lion (S$1.35 mil­lion) and he was banned from us­ing the In­ter­net while await­ing trial.</p>
    <p>The Chicago Sun-Times news­pa­per re­ported that the girl had re­peat­edly brought up her age in mes­sages with Yee on What­sApp. He al­legedly told her to re­move her age from her What­sApp pro­file.</p>
    <p>Af­ter their re­la­tion­ship soured, she con­tacted a group called “in­ter­ested in ex­pos­ing pae­dophiles” and US Home­land Se­cu­rity of­fi­cials were no­ti­fied, said the re­port, cit­ing pros­e­cu­tors.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of the child pornog­ra­phy charges, Yee’s asy­lum sta­tus could be re­voked and he could be de­ported.</p>
    <p>Five years ago, Yee’s on­line post­ings landed him in trou­ble in Sin­ga­pore. Then 16, he up­loaded an ob­scene im­age and posted an ex­ple­tive-laden video in­tend­ing to hurt the feel­ings of Chris­tians.</p>
    <p>He was re­manded for over 50 days, in­clud­ing two weeks at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health for psy­chi­atric ex­am­i­na­tion. While out on bail, he re­peat­edly breached bail con­di­tions and re­fused to speak to a pro­ba­tion of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>He was con­victed in May 2015 of ha­rass­ment and in­sult­ing a re­li­gious group over com­ments he made about Chris­tians and found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew soon af­ter Mr Lee’s death.</p>
    <p>Ahead of his sen­tenc­ing, 77 in­di­vid­u­als signed an open let­ter in July 2015 in which they urged the state to “dis­charge its pros­e­cu­to­rial func­tion with cau­tion, sen­si­tiv­ity and gen­eros­ity”. He was sen­tenced to four weeks’ jail.</p>
    <p>In 2016, he was charged again with hate speech, hav­ing de­lib­er­ately posted com­ments in on­line videos and blog posts that were deroga­tory of Chris­tian­ity and Is­lam. He pleaded guilty and was jailed for six weeks and fined $2,000. In De­cem­ber that year, he left for the US, a day be­fore he was to re­port for a med­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tion ahead of en­list­ment into na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>When he ar­rived in Chicago, he told the US au­thor­i­ties he was seek­ing po­lit­i­cal asy­lum and an Im­mi­gra­tion Court judge in Illi­nois granted him asy­lum in March 2017.</p>
    <p>Yee’s so­cial me­dia ac­counts were banned from YouTube, Word­Press, Face­book and Twit­ter in 2018, for pro-pae­dophilia mes­sages posted on­line.</p>
