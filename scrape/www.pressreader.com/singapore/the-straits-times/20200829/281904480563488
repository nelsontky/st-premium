    <p>• Po­lice in Hong Kong are us­ing the past words and deeds of gov­ern­ment crit­ics to bol­ster in­ves­ti­ga­tions un­der the city’s sweep­ing new se­cu­rity law, de­spite the leg­is­la­tion not be­ing retroac­tive.</p>
    <p>The law, de­scribed by China as a “sword” hang­ing over the heads of its pro-democ­racy op­po­nents, was im­posed by Bei­jing in June, with the au­thor­i­ties promis­ing it would not ap­ply to past trans­gres­sions.</p>
    <p>But de­tails from more than 20 ar­rests so far show that ac­tions in­clud­ing po­lit­i­cal speeches and on­line posts made be­fore the law was in­tro­duced have formed a key part of in­ves­ti­ga­tions, help­ing the po­lice ob­tain search war­rants, con­duct raids and make ar­rests.</p>
    <p>“They will go back into your history and look for con­nec­tions,” one lawyer in­volved in na­tional se­cu­rity in­ves­ti­ga­tions told Agence FrancePres­se (AFP), re­quest­ing anonymity to speak freely. He said the po­lice were em­pow­ered to use past acts as “back­ground in­for­ma­tion” for both in­ves­ti­ga­tions and up­com­ing tri­als.</p>
    <p>On Aug 10, the po­lice con­ducted their largest op­er­a­tion yet un­der the law, ar­rest­ing 10 peo­ple – six of them for “col­lud­ing with for­eign forces”.</p>
    <p>Much of the drama cen­tred on the ar­rest of news­pa­per owner Jimmy Lai and a sub­se­quent raid by more than 200 of­fi­cers on his Ap­ple Daily news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>On the same day, three of­fi­cers paid a more dis­creet visit to the lo­cal news­room of Nikkei, the Ja­panese fi­nan­cial news­pa­per, armed with a court or­der.</p>
    <p>The rea­son, ac­cord­ing to a source present who spoke to AFP on con­di­tion of anonymity, was an ad­ver­tise­ment placed in Nikkei a year ago call­ing for in­ter­na­tional sup­port for pro-democ­racy protests which at that time were con­vuls­ing the city.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar ads ran in pa­pers around the world and were paid for through crowd-fund­ing.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing a col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­fort, the Nikkei ad fea­tured the name of pro-democ­racy party De­mo­sisto, which was led by young ac­tivists un­til it was dis­banded hours be­fore the se­cu­rity law kicked in.</p>
    <p>Later that evening, one of De­mo­sisto’s lead­ing fig­ures, Agnes Chow, 23, was ar­rested along­side two other for­mer stu­dent ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>At a me­dia brief­ing that day, the po­lice of­fered some de­tails of the op­er­a­tion. With­out nam­ing in­di­vid­u­als, they said me­dia com­pany ex­ec­u­tives al­legedly used an over­seas ac­count to pro­vide fi­nan­cial sup­port to a three-mem­ber group that lob­bied for for­eign sanc­tions against Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“The group re­mained ac­tive af­ter the law came into force,” se­nior su­per­in­ten­dent Li Kwai-wah said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter her re­lease, Ms Chow said the col­lu­sion charges were “very vague ac­cu­sa­tions with­out spec­i­fy­ing time and means”, and she was “clue­less” about what ac­tions she may have taken that went against the new law.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to Ap­ple Daily, Lai said the po­lice fo­cused their at­ten­tion on calls he made lob­by­ing for in­ter­na­tional ac­tion be­fore the na­tional se­cu­rity law took ef­fect on June 30.</p>
    <p>Past so­cial me­dia posts have also be­come a fo­cus for the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Mr Tony Chung, 19, was ar­rested along­side three oth­ers on July 29 for al­legedly in­cit­ing se­ces­sion. He is a for­mer mem­ber of Stu­dent­lo­cal­ism, a pro-in­de­pen­dence group that dis­banded its Hong Kong chap­ter be­fore the na­tional se­cu­rity law came into force.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said the ar­rests were made af­ter an over­seas group left a post on Face­book, fol­low­ing the im­po­si­tion of the se­cu­rity law, call­ing for Hong Kong to be­come a repub­lic.</p>
    <p>Mr Chung de­nied hav­ing any­thing to do with the post. Dur­ing his 40 hours of de­ten­tion, he said, most of the ev­i­dence pre­sented by the po­lice was made up of old so­cial me­dia com­ments. “All those posts were pub­lished be­fore the law came into force, with the old­est one dated in 2016,” Mr Chung told AFP.</p>
    <p>A Hong Kong po­lice spokesman de­clined to comment on ac­tive in­ves­ti­ga­tions but said “there is no retroac­tive ef­fect” on the work car­ried out un­der the new law.</p>
    <p>So far, only one per­son has been charged un­der the leg­is­la­tion – a man who al­legedly drove a mo­tor­bike and rammed into po­lice of­fi­cers while fly­ing a pro-in­de­pen­dence flag. He is fac­ing one count of ter­ror­ism and one charge of in­cit­ing se­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The lawyer in­volved in na­tional se­cu­rity cases said he be­lieved the po­lice of­ten had no in­ten­tion of charg­ing those ar­rested.</p>
    <p>“In­tim­i­da­tion, for­feit­ing their travel doc­u­ments, and us­ing those re­leased on bail to pick up more peo­ple are the three pur­poses,” he said.</p>
    <p>District coun­cil­lor Chow Wai­hung was the 11th per­son ar­rested un­der the law af­ter he raised plac­ards at a protest late last month, in­clud­ing one that read “Lib­er­ate Hong Kong, rev­o­lu­tion of our times” – a pop­u­lar but now banned slo­gan.</p>
    <p>“No of­fi­cer an­swered when I asked why I was ac­cused of in­cit­ing se­ces­sion,” he told AFP af­ter he was re­leased on bail. “Ex­cept one who shouted that I should pre­pare for three years in jail.”</p>
