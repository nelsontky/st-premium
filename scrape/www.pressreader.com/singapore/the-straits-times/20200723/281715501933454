    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Tues­day said the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion in Amer­ica would worsen be­fore im­prov­ing and en­cour­aged Amer­i­cans to wear masks, break­ing with his ear­lier op­ti­mism that the virus would dis­ap­pear and his re­luc­tance to­wards masks.</p>
    <p>His shift in tone dur­ing his re­turn to the White House brief­ing room podium after a long hia­tus ap­peared to be an at­tempt to re­gain the po­lit­i­cal nar­ra­tive, as coro­n­avirus cases and deaths surge in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The re­ver­sal from his ini­tial down­play­ing of the se­ri­ous­ness of the virus comes amid a spate of polls show­ing his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den ex­pand­ing his lead over Mr Trump into the dou­ble dig­its, less than four months to the Novem­ber elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The United States recorded over 1,000 deaths on Tues­day, the first time it has crossed that sin­gle-day mark since the start of June.</p>
    <p>It has al­most four mil­lion con­firmed cases, but the true num­ber of in­fec­tions could be two to 13 times higher, ac­cord­ing to a Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion study pub­lished on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said as he opened the brief­ing on Tues­day: “It will prob­a­bly, un­for­tu­nately, get worse be­fore it gets bet­ter. Some­thing I don’t like say­ing about things, but that’s the way it is.”</p>
    <p>He had tweeted that wear­ing masks was “pa­tri­otic” and posted a photo of him­self wear­ing a mask on Mon­day after months of choos­ing not to wear one.</p>
    <p>“We’re ask­ing every­body that when you are not able to so­cially dis­tance, wear a mask, get a mask,” he said at Tues­day’s brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“Whether you like the mask or not, they have an im­pact.”</p>
    <p>The brief­ing was rel­a­tively short, last­ing around 30 min­utes, and fo­cused mostly on his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus, un­like some of his pre­vi­ous brief­ings which could last hours and in­cluded at­tacks on Democrats and me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>He pre­vi­ously helmed those brief­ings al­most daily in March, when the pan­demic first spiked in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>But he stopped do­ing so in April after a back­lash to his sug­ges­tion that dis­in­fec­tants could be in­jected into Covid-19 pa­tients to treat them.</p>
    <p>He may well see the brief­ings as a way to reach more vot­ers and drum up sup­port for him­self, es­pe­cially since the pan­demic cur­tails at­ten­dance at in-per­son ral­lies.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, he told re­porters in the Oval Of­fice as he an­nounced the re­turn of the brief­ings: “I was do­ing them and we had a lot of peo­ple watch­ing, record num­bers watch­ing in the his­tory of ca­ble tele­vi­sion, and there’s never been any­thing like it.</p>
    <p>“It’s a great way to get in­for­ma­tion out to the pub­lic as to where we are with the vac­cines and the ther­a­peu­tics,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We had a good slot. A lot of peo­ple were watch­ing.”</p>
    <p>But one crit­i­cism he drew at the brief­ing was the ab­sence of a clear na­tional plan to com­bat the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“We are in the process of de­vel­op­ing a strat­egy that’s go­ing to be very, very pow­er­ful. We’ve de­vel­oped them as we go along,” he said, without giv­ing fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>This could dis­ad­van­tage him against Mr Bi­den, who vot­ers rate higher in re­spond­ing to the coro­n­avirus and who is also try­ing to seize the nar­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>Hours be­fore the Tues­day brief­ing, the former vice-pres­i­dent an­nounced a US$775 bil­lion (S$1.07 tril­lion) economic plan fo­cus­ing on af­ford­able care­giv­ing, which he linked to Amer­ica’s economic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>In his speech broad­cast on­line, he blasted Mr Trump’s ap­proach, say­ing: “This man sim­ply doesn’t un­der­stand. He can’t deal with our economic cri­sis without serv­ing and sav­ing and solv­ing the pub­lic health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“For all his blus­ter about his ex­per­tise on the econ­omy, he’s un­able to ex­plain how he’ll ac­tu­ally help the work­ing fam­i­lies hit the hard­est. You know, he’s quit on you, and he’s quit on this coun­try.”</p>
    <p>A Quin­nip­iac Univer­sity poll on July 15 found that 57 per cent of Amer­i­cans think Mr Bi­den would do a bet­ter job han­dling a cri­sis, com­pared with 38 per cent who say the same of Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The same poll showed 62 per cent of vot­ers think Mr Trump is hurt­ing rather than help­ing ef­forts to slow the spread of the coro­n­avirus. chary­ong@sph.com.sg</p>
