    <p>• China is pre­par­ing to launch an an­titrust probe into Al­pha­bet’s Google, look­ing into al­le­ga­tions that it has lever­aged the dom­i­nance of its An­droid mo­bile op­er­at­ing sys­tem to sti­fle com­pe­ti­tion, two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>The case was pro­posed by telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment gi­ant Huawei Tech­nolo­gies last year and has been sub­mit­ted by the coun­try’s top mar­ket reg­u­la­tor to the State Coun­cil’s an­titrust com­mit­tee for re­view, they added.</p>
    <p>A de­ci­sion on whether to pro­ceed with a for­mal in­ves­ti­ga­tion may come as soon as this month and could be af­fected by the state of China’s re­la­tion­ship with the United States, one of the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial in­ves­ti­ga­tion fol­lows a raft of ac­tions by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion to hob­ble Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies, cit­ing na­tional se­cu­rity risks.</p>
    <p>This has in­cluded putting Huawei on its trade black­list, threat­en­ing sim­i­lar ac­tion for Semi­con­duc­tor</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Corp and or­der­ing TikTok owner ByteDance to di­vest the short-form video app.</p>
    <p>It also comes as China em­barks on a ma­jor re­vamp of its an­titrust laws, with pro­posed amend­ments in­clud­ing a dra­matic in­crease in max­i­mum fines and ex­panded cri­te­ria for judg­ing a com­pany’s con­trol of a mar­ket.</p>
    <p>A po­ten­tial probe would also look at ac­cu­sa­tions that Google’s mar­ket po­si­tion could cause “ex­treme dam­age” to Chi­nese com­pa­nies such as Huawei, as los­ing the US tech gi­ant’s sup­port for An­droid-based op­er­at­ing sys­tems would lead to loss of con­fi­dence and rev­enue, a sec­ond per­son said.</p>
    <p>The sources were not au­tho­rised to speak pub­licly on the mat­ter and de­clined to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Google did not pro­vide im­me­di­ate com­ment, while Huawei de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>China’s top mar­ket reg­u­la­tor, the State Ad­min­is­tra­tion for Mar­ket Reg­u­la­tion, and the State Coun­cil did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The US trade black­list bars Google from pro­vid­ing tech­ni­cal sup­port to new Huawei phone mod­els and ac­cess to Google Mo­bile Ser­vices, the bun­dle of de­vel­oper ser­vices upon which most An­droid apps are based.</p>
    <p>Google had a tem­po­rary li­cence that ex­empted it from the ban on Huawei but it ex­pired in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>It was not im­me­di­ately clear what Google ser­vices the po­ten­tial probe would fo­cus on. Most Chi­nese smart­phone ven­dors use an open-source ver­sion of the An­droid plat­form with al­ter­na­tives to Google ser­vices on their do­mes­tic phones.</p>
    <p>Google’s search, e-mail and other ser­vices are blocked in China.</p>
    <p>Huawei has said it missed its 2019 rev­enue tar­get by US$12 bil­lion (S$16.4 bil­lion), which com­pany of­fi­cials have at­trib­uted to US ac­tions against it.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing to over­come its reliance on Google, the Chi­nese firm an­nounced plans last month to in­tro­duce its pro­pri­etary Har­mony op­er­at­ing sys­tem in smart­phones next year.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors will be look­ing at ex­am­ples set by their peers in Europe and In­dia if it pro­ceeds with the an­titrust in­ves­ti­ga­tion, the first source said. “China will also look at what other coun­tries have done, in­clud­ing hold­ing in­quiries with Google ex­ec­u­tives,” said the per­son.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond source said that one learn­ing point would be how fines are levied based on a firm’s global rev­enues rather than lo­cal rev­enues.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the Euro­pean Union fined Google €4.3 bil­lion (S$6.9 bil­lion) over anti-com­pet­i­tive practices, in­clud­ing forc­ing phone mak­ers to pre-in­stall Google apps on An­droid de­vices and block­ing them from us­ing ri­vals to Google’s An­droid and search engine.</p>
    <p>That de­ci­sion prompted Google to give Euro­pean users more choice over de­fault search tools, and gave hand­set mak­ers more lee­way to use com­pet­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The In­dian au­thor­i­ties are look­ing into al­le­ga­tions that Google is abus­ing its mar­ket po­si­tion to un­fairly pro­mote its mo­bile pay­ments app.</p>
