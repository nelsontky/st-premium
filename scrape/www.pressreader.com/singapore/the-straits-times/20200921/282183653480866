    <p>Re­cently, the United King­dom rolled out a scheme known as Eat Out To Help Out. The pur­pose was to give cus­tomers an in­cen­tive to eat in a restau­rant by pro­vid­ing them with a dis­count which could then be claimed from the gov­ern­ment by the es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>This idea was in­tro­duced to boost con­sumer spend­ing in the strug­gling hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try, which was heav­ily af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>When the Eat Out To Help Out scheme was launched, 83,000 busi­nesses signed up. This strat­egy was widely wel­comed by the pub­lic which led to a surge in eat­ing out. But, due to the crowds at restau­rants, the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in­creased.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore’s food in­dus­try has also been af­fected by Covid-19, a sim­i­lar scheme could be adopted here. More gov­ern­ment in­cen­tives for food de­liv­ery could be given to help the in­dus­try re­cover yet pre­vent crowd­ing at food out­lets lead­ing to a spread in in­fec­tions.</p>
