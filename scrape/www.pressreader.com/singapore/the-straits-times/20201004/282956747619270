    <p>Editorial</p>
    <p>The Korea Her­ald, South Korea</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment and the rul­ing Demo­cratic Party of Korea keep tight­en­ing busi­ness reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness cir­cles ap­pealed to them for days to re­con­sider three “fair econ­omy” Bills. But they are adamant. The rul­ing party is poised to pass them through the Na­tional Assem­bly. Un­der the ban­ner of a fair econ­omy, they pro­posed Bills to re­vise the com­mer­cial law and fair trade law, and en­act the fi­nan­cial group su­per­vi­sion law, but com­pa­nies worry about the Bills ex­pos­ing their man­age­rial right to threats from spec­u­la­tive for­eign in­vestors while of­fer­ing few self-de­fence tools.</p>
    <p>If busi­nesses are com­pelled into a sit­u­a­tion where they must con­cen­trate on de­fend­ing their man­age­ment right, they will likely be dis­tracted from busi­ness and in­vest­ment. To add to their trou­bles, the Min­istry of Justice sud­denly an­nounced Bills last week to ex­pand class ac­tion and puni­tive dam­ages to all industries.</p>
    <p>Puni­tive dam­ages are ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing com­pa­nies from vi­o­lat­ing laws ma­lig­nantly. How­ever, these may cause heavy le­gal ex­penses to com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Ex­ces­sive lit­i­ga­tion can ex­haust cor­po­rate re­sources. Even if a firm wins a law­suit, dam­age to its pub­lic im­age and rev­enue is in­evitable. Small busi­nesses may go bank­rupt if they can­not af­ford to pay out as­tro­nom­i­cal rec­om­pense. At­tor­neys may file friv­o­lous suits just to earn quick set­tle­ments.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing party has pro­posed a Bill to keep large re­tail­ers up to 20km away from the bound­ary of a tra­di­tional mar­ket. The ex­ist­ing dis­tance is 1km. Though ex­ist­ing large re­tail­ers are ex­empted from the new dis­tance reg­u­la­tion, crit­ics note that it is prac­ti­cally im­pos­si­ble for new dis­trib­u­tors to find proper sites for their re­tail out­lets 20km away from any tra­di­tional mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Pro­tec­tion of mom-and-pop stores is im­por­tant, but large re­tail­ers should be able to com­pete and sur­vive. Also, it is ques­tion­able whether con­sumer in­ter­ests will be served by block­ing large stores.</p>
    <p>Many com­pa­nies are reel­ing from the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19. Ac­cord­ing to the Bank of Korea, the pro­por­tion of firms un­able to gen­er­ate enough op­er­at­ing prof­its to pay in­ter­est is forecast to rise from 14.8 per cent last year to 21.4 per cent this year. The Korea Eco­nomic Re­search In­sti­tute projects the econ­omy to plunge to a neg­a­tive 3.8 per cent growth in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>In this chal­leng­ing time, Bills con­strain­ing busi­nesses are pour­ing out, while new dereg­u­la­tion mea­sures are nowhere in sight. If the gov­ern­ment and the rul­ing party keep driv­ing busi­nesses into a blind al­ley as if they are a pub­lic en­emy to or­di­nary folk, there is no hope of eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Road to eco­nomic re­cov­ery</p>
    <p>Wang Xiaosong</p>
    <p>China Daily (Asia), China</p>
    <p>In seven meet­ings from July to Septem­ber, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping re­it­er­ated the im­por­tance of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) to China’s long-term strate­gic de­vel­op­ment, and said the next five-year plan pe­riod will be the key stage in the Chi­nese na­tion’s de­vel­op­ment path.</p>
    <p>The next five years are likely to see dras­tic changes in the global en­vi­ron­ment in terms of econ­omy, sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy, cul­ture, na­tional se­cu­rity and in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions. Also, China is likely to face greater ex­ter­nal pres­sure.</p>
    <p>In the past cou­ple of years, the anti-glob­al­i­sa­tion trend in many coun­tries has had a neg­a­tive im­pact on China’s ex­ter­nal eco­nomic ex­changes.</p>
    <p>That’s why Xi has em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of the “dual cir­cu­la­tion” de­vel­op­ment pat­tern, which is cen­tred on the do­mes­tic econ­omy (“in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion”) and aimed at in­te­grat­ing the do­mes­tic econ­omy with the global econ­omy (“ex­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion”) to de­velop new ad­van­tages for China in global co­op­er­a­tion and com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>To boost in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion and strike a dy­namic bal­ance be­tween sup­ply and de­mand, China should fo­cus more on do­mes­tic out­put, dis­tri­bu­tion, cir­cu­la­tion and con­sump­tion, es­pe­cially be­cause lower do­mes­tic con­sump­tion due to Covid-19 is the big­gest hin­drance to dual cir­cu­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Dual cir­cu­la­tion is about strik­ing the right bal­ance be­tween in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion, as well as within the do­mes­tic econ­omy. But to achieve such a bal­ance, China needs to ad­dress the out­stand­ing eco­nomic prob­lems in­clud­ing shrink­ing ex­ter­nal de­mand and the un­bal­anced do­mes­tic de­mand struc­ture. In short, the dual cir­cu­la­tion de­vel­op­ment pat­tern re­quires China to boost do­mes­tic de­mand, ex­pand its re­search and de­vel­op­ment ca­pac­ity, and fur­ther open up its econ­omy.</p>
    <p>First, to boost do­mes­tic de­mand, we need to in­crease peo­ple’s con­sump­tion, and peo­ple will spend more only if they have more dis­pos­able in­come. So mea­sures should be taken to in­crease the in­comes of peo­ple at all lev­els so peo­ple will spend more and raise over­all na­tional con­sump­tion. Among the mea­sures the au­thor­i­ties can take is help­ing the mar­ket to cre­ate more jobs, raise wages across the board, and im­prove the so­cial se­cu­rity and pub­lic wel­fare ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, China oc­cu­pies an im­por­tant place in global in­dus­trial chains. But given the growth of its eco­nomic strength and the dras­tic changes in its ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment, China can’t meet all its goals by ad­her­ing to the for­mer de­vel­op­ment and trade pat­terns, es­pe­cially be­cause the coun­try has to face the daunt­ing chal­lenge of uncer­tain ex­ports.</p>
    <p>Third, the main aim of strength­en­ing R&D is to boost the de­vel­op­ment of core and ad­vanced tech­nolo­gies and pro­mote in­no­va­tion, so as to neu­tralise the ef­fects of Western bans on ex­ports of their high-tech prod­ucts and sanc­tions on Chi­nese en­ter­prises. Since the big­gest ob­sta­cle to China’s high-qual­ity eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment is in­suf­fi­cient core tech­nolo­gies, it should bol­ster re­search in ba­sic sciences and al­lo­cate more funds for ad­vanced R&D.</p>
    <p>And fourth, China will de­velop closer re­la­tions with the global econ­omy in the fu­ture, but for that the au­thor­i­ties need to fur­ther open up the econ­omy to the out­side world, thus pro­vid­ing a big­ger mar­ket for other coun­tries and at­tract­ing more in­ter­na­tional prod­ucts and re­sources.</p>
    <p>Let’s cre­ate jobs</p>
    <p>Peter Wal­lace</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Daily In­quirer, Philip­pines</p>
    <p>I can’t un­der­stand Congress. Here we are, seven months since the Cre­ate (cor­po­rate re­cov­ery and tax in­cen­tives for en­ter­prises) Bill was cer­ti­fied as ur­gent by Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte. Here we are in Oc­to­ber, and still no Cre­ate Bill sub­mit­ted to the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Here we are with busi­ness strug­gling to sur­vive from the dec­i­ma­tion of Covid-19. As Fi­nance Sec­re­tary Sonny Dominguez said, the 5 per cent re­duc­tion in cor­po­rate in­come tax that Cre­ate would pro­vide will help en­ter­prises con­tinue and re­tain em­ploy­ees. The re­ori­en­ta­tion of in­cen­tives will also al­low us “to ag­gres­sively go after the in­vest­ments that will greatly ben­e­fit the Filipino peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>In­stead, with no one know­ing what tax they’ll pay, the busi­nesses that are shift­ing from China due to Covid-19 are go­ing to Viet­nam and our other Asean com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>Not the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent has cer­ti­fied Cre­ate as a pri­or­ity Bill, but it’s not been given that pri­or­ity. It’s now time to just act, and pass the Bill. There are five other Bills that make up a pri­or­ity pack­age that busi­ness con­sid­ers es­sen­tial to grow­ing in­vest­ment at a far faster rate.</p>
    <p>I ap­peal to our sen­a­tors: Give us Cre­ate, and the rest of the com­pre­hen­sive tax re­form and sup­port­ive Bills, now. Our econ­omy needs to be re­vived, our peo­ple need jobs – des­per­ately. Give them, please. me­dia part­ner Asia News Net­work, a group­ing of 24 news me­dia ti­tles.</p>
