    <p>The an­nual Christ­mas con­certs put up by the Cathe­dral Choir of the Risen Christ at the Cathe­dral of the Good Shep­herd since 2002 are usu­ally watched by min­is­ters, diplo­mats and high com­mis­sion­ers from all over the globe. The venue has a seat­ing ca­pac­ity of 650.</p>
    <p>The choir’s 47th Christ­mas con­cert this year, how­ever, will be a lit­tle dif­fer­ent. Like many other live per­for­mances this year, it will go dig­i­tal due to Covid-19 restrictio­ns.</p>
    <p>The choir will be pre­sent­ing two con­certs on­line. The first, Christ­mas Lives On! is per­formed at the Cathe­dral of the Good Shep­herd. Part one was up­loaded on the choir’s so­cial me­dia pages last Satur­day. Part two will be up­loaded to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond con­cert, A Child Is Born will be held at Novena Church which in­vited the choir to stage an on­line pre­sen­ta­tion for them. This per­for­mance will be up­loaded on Novena Church’s so­cial me­dia pages to­day.</p>
    <p>Peter Low, the founder, di­rec­tor and con­duc­tor of the choir, refers to the pan­demic as a “freak of na­ture” and had thought that there would be no Christ­mas con­cert this year.</p>
    <p>His two daugh­ters, aged 39 and 43, how­ever, were “adamant that the con­cert should go on”. This prompted the 72-year-old to think of go­ing on­line to pre­serve the tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>It was not an easy un­der­tak­ing. “It was re­ally a chal­lenge,” said Low who has three grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally had to sit down and think hard about how to over­come all the ob­sta­cles: safe-dis­tanc­ing, restrictio­ns on the num­ber of per­form­ers who could sing with­out masks and so on.”</p>
    <p>The choir started pre­par­ing for the con­cert — which in­volves 76 cho­ris­ters per­form­ing 34 songs from all over the globe in their orig­i­nal lan­guages — only in the mid­dle of last month. This was right af­ter the cap was lifted to al­low 30 per­form­ers on stage at any one time.</p>
    <p>“We barely had any op­por­tu­nity to have long prac­tices. It was just two evenings when we gath­ered to set­tle our po­si­tion­ing since we all had to stand 1m apart dur­ing the per­for­mances,” he said.</p>
    <p>The two con­certs will also fea­ture dances and mu­sic ac­com­pa­ni­ment pay­ing homage to the coun­tries that the songs orig­i­nate from.</p>
    <p>Low said: “There is re­ally an unimag­in­able num­ber of carols out there be­sides what we lis­ten to in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I would love for our con­certs to spark cu­rios­ity in lis­ten­ers to look fur­ther into Christ­mas mu­sic and ex­plore be­yond what they are used to.”</p>
