    <p>Twenty-two trav­ellers from China flew here last Fri­day, the first day Sin­ga­pore uni­lat­er­ally opened its bor­ders to vis­i­tors from the main­land.</p>
    <p>All tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 on ar­riv­ing here, the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s move to uni­lat­er­ally lift its bor­der re­stric­tions also ap­plies to the state of Vic­to­ria in Aus­tralia. It is not known how many came to Sin­ga­pore from Vic­to­ria on Fri­day as trav­ellers are re­quired only to de­clare the coun­try they come from, not the spe­cific state.</p>
    <p>As part of the uni­lat­eral bor­der open­ing, tourists and trav­ellers fly­ing into Sin­ga­pore need not serve a stay-home no­tice if their Covid-19 test is neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The same ap­plies to Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents and long-term pass hold­ers re­turn­ing from China and Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore had ear­lier an­nounced sim­i­lar uni­lat­eral mea­sures for all forms of travel from Brunei, New Zealand, Viet­nam and all other parts of Aus­tralia ex­cept Vic­to­ria, which un­til re­cently had been bat­tling more cases than the rest of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Since air travel pass ap­pli­ca­tions opened on Sept 1, CAAS has ap­proved 2,613 re­quests to come to Sin­ga­pore from Brunei, New Zealand, Viet­nam, Aus­tralia and China. Of these, 811 vis­i­tors have ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore as at Fri­day – 336 from Viet­nam, 232 from Brunei, 115 from New Zealand, 106 from Aus­tralia and 22 from China.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 1,465 peo­ple have yet to travel, while 337 ap­pli­ca­tions have ex­pired.</p>
    <p>CAAS had said on Oct 29 that main­land China and Vic­to­ria were the lat­est to be added to the list of coun­tries with uni­lat­eral open­ings as they have com­pre­hen­sive pub­lic health sur­veil­lance sys­tems and had suc­cess­fully con­trolled the spread of the Covid-19 virus.</p>
    <p>China has a virus lo­cal in­ci­dence rate of 0.00009 cases per 100,000 peo­ple, while Vic­to­ria has a rate of 0.099 cases per 100,000 peo­ple, it noted in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants from China or Aus­tralia must have re­mained in their coun­try in the last 14 con­sec­u­tive days be­fore en­try into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese and Aus­tralians are al­lowed to leave their own coun­tries, with some re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also has an up­com­ing two-way travel bub­ble with Hong Kong and mul­ti­ple green lanes for busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel with Ja­pan, South Korea, China, Malaysia, Brunei, In­done­sia and Ger­many.</p>
