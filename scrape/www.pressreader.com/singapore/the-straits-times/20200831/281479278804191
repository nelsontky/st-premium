    <p>Per­haps the best-known stock mar­ket in­dex in the world, the bench­mark Dow Jones In­dus­trial</p>
    <p>Av­er­age, un­der­went a makeover last week to re­flect emerg­ing mar­ket real­i­ties.</p>
    <p>As Ms Kristina Hooper, chief global mar­ket strate­gist at In­vesco, was quoted as say­ing: Old econ­omy com­po­nent stocks were re­placed by new econ­omy stocks.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially the re­bal­anc­ing or re­jig­ging saw petro­chem­i­cal gi­ant ExxonMo­bil, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Pfizer and aero­space-de­fence player Raytheon re­placed on the 30-stock in­dex by cloud com­put­ing spe­cial­ist Sales­force, biotech firm Am­gen, and aero­space and in­dus­trial man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pany Honey­well In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>A key rea­son for the re­bal­anc­ing was the im­pend­ing four-to-one split of Ap­ple stock to­day that would ef­fec­tively re­duce the tech sec­tor’s rep­re­sen­ta­tion on the price-weighted Dow in­dex.</p>
    <p>But as S&P Dow Jones In­dices, the com­pany which over­sees the Dow, said, the re­bal­anc­ing was also to di­ver­sify the in­dex by re­mov­ing over­laps be­tween com­pa­nies of sim­i­lar scope and adding new types of busi­nesses that bet­ter re­flect the Amer­i­can econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the evo­lu­tion of the United States econ­omy has seen many older gi­ants, like Gen­eral Elec­tric and ExxonMo­bil, be­ing re­placed on Wall Street’s main in­dexes by the likes of Face­book, Ap­ple, Amazon, Al­pha­bet, Net­flix and Google (col­lec­tively known as Faang).</p>
    <p>There is an im­por­tant les­son here for Sin­ga­pore, and in par­tic­u­lar the mar­ket’s bench­mark FTSE Straits Times In­dex, com­monly known as the STI. The STI was set up in 1966, and dur­ing its first 30 years it mir­rored the eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion of Sin­ga­pore from a Third World to First World coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tain-based FTSE Russell part­ners with Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH), pub­lisher of The Straits Times, and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change to jointly com­pute and man­age the avatar of the bench­mark in­di­ca­tor of the Sin­ga­pore stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Like the Dow, the Sin­ga­pore in­dex com­prises 30 com­po­nent stocks of the largest listed com­pa­nies, sub­ject to free float and liq­uid­ity cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the three lo­cal banks, six real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts, prom­i­nent Te­masek-linked play­ers like Sing­tel, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries and ST En­gi­neer­ing, a handful of prop­erty com­pa­nies, the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change, Com­fortDelGro and a few oth­ers.</p>
    <p>There are seven “for­eign” com­pa­nies, com­pris­ing the likes of the Jar­dine group, Yangz­i­jiang Ship­build­ing Hold­ings and Thai Bev­er­age.</p>
    <p>The only com­pany that comes any­where close to be­ing a “tech” play is home-grown con­tract man­u­fac­turer Ven­ture Corp.</p>
    <p>There are pe­ri­odic re­views of the in­dex, lead­ing to tweaks and re­bal­anc­ings. A ma­jor one was done in Septem­ber 2015, when UOL Group, Yangz­i­jiang and Sats re­placed Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings, Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings and Olam In­ter­na­tional as con­stituents fol­low­ing a semi-an­nual re­view. Both Jar­dine com­pa­nies re­joined the in­dex later.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, the in­dex went through a mi­nor re­jig in June when Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust was added and SPH re­moved.</p>
    <p>The five high­est-rank­ing non-con­stituents of the STI by mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion – Kep­pel DC Reit, Sun­tec Reit, NetLink NBN Trust, Frasers Lo­gis­tics and In­dus­trial Trust, and Kep­pel Reit – were added to the STI re­serve list, ready to re­place any con­stituents that be­come in­el­i­gi­ble as a re­sult of cor­po­rate actions, be­fore the next re­view. An­other re­view is due on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>But there has been a lot of de­bate about how well the STI rep­re­sents the un­der­ly­ing mar­ket and the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Granted that in­dex con­struc­tion is not an ex­act sci­ence; there have to be judg­ment calls in the case of stocks that meet the liq­uid­ity and size re­quire­ments on pa­per, but may suf­fer from poor gov­er­nance or have “rep­u­ta­tional” is­sues.</p>
    <p>But there are some short­falls in the ex­ist­ing com­po­si­tion of the in­dex that must be ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>First is the glar­ing ab­sence of tech plays.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore is no Wall Street and we do not have the big “Faang-type” plays here, surely we have enough listed com­pa­nies as­so­ci­ated with, and sup­port­ing, the big techs of the world?</p>
    <p>Should they not get some recog­ni­tion on the Sin­ga­pore bench­mark in­dex?</p>
    <p>Se­condly, the three banks – DBS Bank, United Over­seas Bank and OCBC Bank – com­prise 36 per cent of the weight­ing of the in­dex. By any reck­on­ing, this is an “over­weight” of a sin­gle sec­tor.</p>
    <p>On the sub­ject of over­weight, five of the com­po­nent com­pa­nies com­prise 50 per cent of the net mar­ket cap of the 30 com­pa­nies in the in­dex.</p>
    <p>Also, there are 640 main­board and 215 Catal­ist list­ings. Yet the STI com­po­nents com­prise only 5 per cent of the com­pa­nies listed on the main­board. So the in­dex does seem some­what of a nar­row re­flec­tion of the broader mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, at least a quar­ter of the com­pa­nies on the in­dex are off­shore play­ers, ei­ther domi­ciled over­seas or get­ting the bulk of their in­come from out­side the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The STI needs to be ex­panded to in­clude a more broad-based set of com­pa­nies that bet­ter re­flect the diver­sity, vi­brancy and com­plex­ity of the mar­ket. It also needs to re­flect the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy, in some way.</p>
    <p>One way might be to re­dis­tribute the weight­ing by ex­pand­ing from 30 com­po­nent com­pa­nies to, say, 50 com­pa­nies. It will surely be a broader rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the Sin­ga­pore bourse.</p>
    <p>The STI is one of only two key in­dexes of the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket (the other be­ing the MSCI Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>Many ac­tive fund man­agers track these in­dexes to com­pare their fund per­for­mances. Many also model their port­fo­lios based on these in­dexes. So there is an im­per­a­tive to en­sure that the in­dexes ac­cu­rately re­flect the mar­ket’s un­der­ly­ing per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic that has rav­aged the world has changed economies, com­pa­nies and in­vest­ment pri­or­i­ties. Sec­tors cov­er­ing tech, health­care and sup­ply-chain play­ers have ben­e­fited where many other tra­di­tional busi­nesses have suf­fered. Many of them will emerge as for­mi­da­ble play­ers in a new emerg­ing post-Covid-19 econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Global eq­uity in­dexes, in­clud­ing the STI, must make ad­just­ments to recog­nise and cap­ture these changes. As it stands, the STI cov­ers a very small seg­ment of the lo­cal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In­dexes should be re­viewed pe­ri­od­i­cally to en­sure that “mega trends” are suf­fi­ciently cap­tured in them as far as pos­si­ble, so that those look­ing to in­vest in these in­dexes through ex­change-traded funds and even funds bench­marked to key in­dexes will not miss out on the new econ­omy stocks that have taken the lead in the stock mar­ket’s charge ahead in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>As the man­ager of the Dow said, an in­dex must iden­tify busi­nesses that bet­ter re­flect the lo­cal econ­omy and mar­ket.</p>
    <p>As far as the STI goes, there are only two per­ti­nent ques­tions: Is it rel­e­vant and re­flec­tive of the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket and econ­omy? If not, what can be done to make it bet­ter?</p>
