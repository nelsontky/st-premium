    <p>With the slow devel­op­ment of its own Phase 3 clin­i­cal trial of a Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date, Indonesia said it has asked for data from Brazil, where a sim­i­lar trial is pro­gress­ing smoothly.</p>
    <p>It ex­pects to re­ceive the safety and ef­fi­cacy data on Chi­nese firm Si­no­vac Biotech’s Coron­aVac by next Mon­day, and hopes to fi­nally start rolling out its vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme next month.</p>
    <p>A Phase 3 clin­i­cal trial is the fi­nal stage that a vac­cine can­di­date must clear be­fore it is given the go-ahead for use by a coun­try’s reg­u­la­tory agency.</p>
    <p>BPOM, the In­done­sian equiv­a­lent of the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion, has re­quested the data through its For­eign Af­fairs Min­istry, which then com­mu­ni­cated with Brazil’s Na­tional Health Sur­veil­lance Agency and Si­no­vac, said a gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>“Within a mat­ter of days af­ter re­ceiv­ing the data, BPOM may is­sue its emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion on the vac­cine, when a thor­ough eval­u­a­tion is done,” the of­fi­cial told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Brazil car­ried out a strict clin­i­cal trial on Coron­aVac, which it started ear­lier than Indonesia, the of­fi­cial added.</p>
    <p>BPOM’s head Penny K. Luk­ito had ear­lier said a vac­cine can be cho­sen as long as it has gone through the proper tri­als.</p>
    <p>Indonesia has so far se­cured com­mit­ments for 189 mil­lion vac­cine doses from Si­no­vac, US-based No­vavax, as well as Covax, an in­ter­na­tional Covid-19 vac­cine al­lo­ca­tion plat­form co-led by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Brazil, Indonesia, Sin­ga­pore and Tur­key are among the coun­tries ex­pected to use Coron­aVac as part of their vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Indonesia, South-east Asia’s most pop­u­lous coun­try, plans to vac­ci­nate 107.2 mil­lion peo­ple aged between 18 and 59, out of its pop­u­la­tion of 270 mil­lion. Those with med­i­cal con­di­tions or who are deemed un­fit will not be in­cluded.</p>
    <p>It has also set aside a buf­fer of 15 per cent for its vac­cine stock­pile.</p>
    <p>Since the vac­cine is given in two doses, it would need 247 mil­lion doses in its stock­pile by next year.</p>
    <p>Indonesia had planned to start its vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme as soon as last month, but it had to be de­layed, with a poorly or­gan­ised Phase 3 clin­i­cal trial of Coron­aVac fail­ing to gather the data for the vac­cine to be ap­proved.</p>
    <p>State-run drug­maker Bio Farma and the Univer­sity of Pad­jad­jaran in West Java, which be­gan con­duct­ing the trial in Au­gust, have been un­able to come up with an in­terim anal­y­sis, a pre­req­ui­site be­fore BPOM can re­view the vac­cine for ap­proval for emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>With only 1,600 vol­un­teers in the trial and a lack of peo­ple who rep­re­sent the risk groups – such as med­i­cal work­ers – among them, there is a lower chance that the re­quired num­ber of vol­un­teers would be ex­posed to in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>To test the ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cine can­di­date, at least 1.5 per cent of the 1,600 vol­un­teers must have con­tracted the virus so that they can be mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>Brazil re­cruited more than 9,000 vol­un­teers – in­clud­ing am­ple med­i­cal worker vol­un­teers – in its clin­i­cal trial and has thus been able to make bet­ter progress.</p>
