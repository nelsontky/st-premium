    <p>Mr Cum­mings has been at the Pre­mier’s side since he took power in July last year... His de­par­ture will de­prive Mr John­son of his most im­por­tant strate­gist, who has wielded huge in­flu­ence over all as­pects of gov­ern­ment pol­icy, from its pandemic re­sponse to Brexit and eco­nomic re­form.</p>
    <p>A power strug­gle at the up­per ech­e­lons of the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has ended with two of Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s top aides quit­ting within 48 hours of each other.</p>
    <p>Mr Do­minic Cum­mings, who was chief ad­viser to Mr John­son, was pho­tographed leav­ing the PM’s of­fi­cial res­i­dence at 10 Down­ing Street on Friday, two days after com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor Lee Cain said he was re­sign­ing. Both Mr Cum­mings and Mr Cain, said to have com­bat­ive work­ing styles, are close al­lies. The two men and Mr John­son had worked on the Vote Leave cam­paign in 2016.</p>
    <p>A pro­mo­tion to be the PM’s chief of staff of­fered to Mr Cain is at the heart of the power strug­gle.</p>
    <p>The pos­si­ble ap­point­ment sparked protests from min­is­ters, ad­vis­ers and even the prime min­is­ter’s fi­ancee Car­rie Sy­monds.</p>
    <p>Mr Cain was of­fered the po­si­tion after he ob­jected to Mr John­son’s ap­point­ment of Ms Al­le­gra Strat­ton as press spokesman.</p>
    <p>He felt Ms Strat­ton’s job, which was to de­liver White House-style tele­vised press brief­ings, was a chal­lenge to his work as she re­ports to Mr John­son di­rectly.</p>
    <p>Here is a look at the key play­ers in the lat­est drama sur­round­ing No. 10 Down­ing Street:</p>
    <p>BORIS JOHN­SON</p>
    <p>Mr John­son brought Mr Cum­mings and Mr Cain into the gov­ern­ment after the Brexit ref­er­en­dum in 2016. Mr John­son sup­ported Mr Cum­mings in May, after The Guardian re­ported that Mr Cum­mings had bro­ken lock­down rules amid the Covid-19 pandemic, de­spite calls from MPs for the ad­viser to quit.</p>
    <p>Ru­mours that the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Mr John­son and his top aide was break­ing down came on Friday, be­fore Mr Cum­mings quit, when sources told the Daily Tele­graph that the aide said at a brief­ing that Mr John­son was “in­de­ci­sive” – an ac­count that Mr Cum­mings had rub­bished.</p>
    <p>DO­MINIC CUM­MINGS</p>
    <p>Mr Cum­mings had been crit­i­cised for his abra­sive work­ing style, which in­cluded hurl­ing in­sults at politi­cians on his per­sonal blog.</p>
    <p>Mr Cum­mings was in the spot­light ear­lier this year for driv­ing 418km from London to his par­ents’ farm in County Durham and an ear­lier trip to Barnard Cas­tle, a beauty spot, in March, dur­ing a Covid-19 na­tional lock­down.</p>
    <p>He was also re­port­edly upset that Mr Cain was de­nied the post of chief of staff.</p>
    <p>LEE CAIN</p>
    <p>Mr Cain was Mr John­son’s com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor, and had banned min­is­ters from talk­ing to me­dia out­lets that he con­sid­ered pro-re­main in the Brexit strug­gle, such as Ra­dio 4’s To­day pro­gramme and Chan­nel 4 News.</p>
    <p>His pug­na­cious style with MPs and spe­cial ad­vis­ers meant a num­ber ex­pressed out­rage over his po­ten­tial pro­mo­tion, The Guardian re­ported last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The re­port added that Mr Cain had been think­ing about leav­ing Down­ing Street after the Covid-19 out­break be­cause of the re­lent­less na­ture of the job and clashes with Ms Strat­ton – un­til Mr John­son made the pro­mo­tion of­fer.</p>
    <p>CAR­RIE SY­MONDS</p>
    <p>The Guardian on Thurs­day re­ported that Ms Sy­monds, who has a son with Mr John­son, and Mr Cum­mings rep­re­sent “op­po­site ends of the power strug­gle rag­ing at the heart of No. 10”.</p>
    <p>She had re­port­edly crit­i­cised Mr John­son’s de­ci­sion to pro­mote Mr Cain to be chief of staff, a move that upset Mr Cum­mings.</p>
    <p>An­other Guardian re­port the same day noted that Mr Cain and Ms Sy­monds, a for­mer press of­fi­cer with the Con­ser­va­tive Party, had also pre­vi­ously clashed, but no de­tails were pro­vided.</p>
    <p>AL­LE­GRA STRAT­TON</p>
    <p>Ms Strat­ton, a for­mer BBC jour­nal­ist, had re­port­edly op­posed Mr Cain’s pro­mo­tion to chief of staff, the BBC re­ported ear­lier. She was ap­pointed by Mr John­son in early Oc­to­ber to be his spokesman for jour­nal­ist brief­ings, a role that Mr Cain had wanted to go to jour­nal­ist El­lie Price, also from the BBC. good and rip­ping up po­lit­i­cal con­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>Then he helped steer Mr John­son to­wards a his­toric elec­tion vic­tory last De­cem­ber, winning the big­gest Con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity in more than 30 years on a plat­form to “level up” eco­nom­i­cally ne­glected re­gions of the UK.</p>
    <p>But when the pandemic hit at the start of the year, the Cum­mings project ran into a wall.</p>
    <p>All gov­ern­ment fo­cus was turned to com­bat­ing Covid-19 and Mr Cum­mings him­self in­evitably be­came part of the story.</p>
    <p>In May, Mr John­son put his own au­thor­ity on the line to defend Mr Cum­mings, who was ac­cused of break­ing lock­down rules by driv­ing more than 400km to seek child­care help when the pub­lic were be­ing or­dered to stay at home.</p>
    <p>The Pre­mier was so de­ter­mined to keep Mr Cum­mings that he ap­peared in pub­lic at press con­fer­ences and in Par­lia­ment to an­swer ques­tions and re­peat­edly defend his ad­viser’s ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Cain an­nounced he was stand­ing down as Mr John­son’s di­rec­tor of com­mu­ni­ca­tions in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day even­ing.</p>
    <p>“It was an hon­our to be asked to serve as the Prime Min­is­ter’s chief of staff,” Mr Cain said, fol­low­ing re­ports that he had been lined up for the role by Mr John­son.</p>
    <p>It is not clear why Mr Cain did not take up that role. Ac­cord­ing to one ver­sion of events, Mr Cain and Mr Cum­mings had lob­bied the Prime Min­is­ter to give Mr Cain that cov­eted po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>But Mr John­son was un­happy that the ap­point­ment was made pub­lic in Wed­nes­day’s news­pa­pers be­fore he had reached a fi­nal de­ci­sion, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
