        Features Life | | C7 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 30, 2020 To ’Cher, with love It is that time of the year when teachers are feted for their dedication with armfuls of sweet treats, fragrant bouquets and meticulous­ly crafted cards.
Demand for Teachers’ Day gifts this year has been strong. Ms Paige Chiam of home bakery The Local Jardinier (@the_local_jardinier on Instagram) had to turn away customers clamouring for her delicate pebble sables topped with edible flowers.
The travel industry marketeer, 33, who started her business in June as a pandemic side hustle, fulfilled about 200 orders for the $25 sets, which consisted of four pouches, each containing five cookies and a thank-you card.
Judging from chatter in social media parenting groups, masks, mask holders and hand sanitisers are popular items this year, too.
Graphic designer Cindy Ong, who sells learning activity sets at @kiddivity.sg on Instagram, was overwhelme­d with more than 900 Teachers’ Day orders for her customised mask cases at $6 each. She had to close pre-orders early this month.
Gift guidelines vary in preschools and private institutio­ns, but a spokesman from the Ministry of Education says that “teachers are generally allowed to accept inexpensiv­e gifts or handmade gifts”.
Beyond just gifts on one day, Ms Aiwen Soh, principal of Star Learners @ Thomson childcare centre, says teachers value “warm greetings, smiles and appreciati­on throughout the year”.
“That said, we definitely l ove sweet treats like cookies and cakes to keep us energised throughout the day. Not forgetting lovely handmade cards that remind us that we are indeed shaping the future, one child at a time.”
The Sunday Times rounds up some trending presents for the occasion. PERSONALIS­ED SOUPS What says comfort food better than soup?
