    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Twit­ter, Face­book and Snap locked the ac­counts of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, as tech­nol­ogy giants scram­bled to crack down on his base­less claims about the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion amid ri­ots in the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter hid and man­dated the re­moval of three of Mr Trump’s tweets “as a re­sult of the un­prece­dented and on­go­ing vi­o­lent sit­u­a­tion in Wash­ing­ton, DC”, af­ter proTrump pro­test­ers stormed the US Capi­tol in an at­tempt to force Congress to block the ap­point­ment of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>In a tweet on Wed­nes­day, later taken down by Twit­ter, Mr Trump said the storm­ing of the build­ing was a nat­u­ral re­sponse. He also blamed Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence for lack­ing courage to pur­sue the claims of elec­tion fraud.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter locked Mr Trump’s ac­count un­til 12 hours af­ter he</p>
    <p>Face­book founder and CEO Mark Zucker­berg said yes­ter­day that it would ex­tend the block placed on Mr Trump’s Face­book and In­sta­gram ac­counts, as the risks of al­low­ing him to con­tinue us­ing those ser­vices</p>
    <p>“are sim­ply too great”.</p>
    <p>deleted those tweets and a video, in which he al­leged the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion was fraud­u­lent, and urged pro­test­ers to go home.</p>
    <p>Face­book and YouTube, owned by Al­pha­bet’s Google, like­wise re­moved the video. Snap later joined them in block­ing Mr Trump’s abil­ity to post on Snapchat.</p>
    <p>Face­book founder and CEO Mark Zucker­berg said yes­ter­day that it would ex­tend the block placed on Mr Trump’s Face­book and In­sta­gram ac­counts, as the risks of al­low­ing him to con­tinue us­ing those ser­vices “are sim­ply too great”.</p>
    <p>“We are ex­tend­ing the block... in­def­i­nitely and for at least the next two weeks un­til the peace­ful tran­si­tion of power is com­plete,” he said in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter had also lim­ited the reach of tweets stok­ing the riot. “This means th­ese la­belled tweets will not be able to be replied to, retweeted or liked,” a Twit­ter sup­port team said.</p>
    <p>In the past, Twit­ter had lim­ited the spread of Mr Trump’s in­cen­di­ary posts without re­mov­ing them en­tirely, but Wed­nes­day was the first time the Pres­i­dent had been kicked off ei­ther plat­form, even tem­po­rar­ily. Twit­ter threat­ened to ban Mr Trump en­tirely if he con­tin­ues to break the rules.</p>
    <p>Vi­o­lent rhetoric and ad­vice on weaponry ramped up sig­nif­i­cantly in the past three weeks on so­cial me­dia plat­forms, in­clud­ing white na­tion­al­ists and en­thu­si­asts of the wide-rang­ing QAnon con­spir­acy the­ory, ac­cord­ing to re­searchers and public post­ings. Move­ment lead­ers fre­quently pointed to Mr Trump’s words in their calls to ac­tion, in­clud­ing the Pres­i­dent’s ex­hor­ta­tion that the events in Wash­ing­ton on Jan 6 would be “wild”.</p>
    <p>But in thou­sands of posts on Twit­ter and Face­book on Wed­nes­day, mem­bers of the far-right pushed the un­founded claim that the mob that stormed the Capi­tol was made up of lib­eral ac­tivists pos­ing as a pro-Trump com­mu­nity to give it a bad name.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral posts shared by thou­sands of peo­ple held up pho­to­graphs as ev­i­dence that sup­port­ers of An­tifa – a loosely or­gan­ised col­lec­tive of anti-fas­cist ac­tivists – were be­hind the un­rest.</p>
    <p>Among the most pop­u­lar fig­ures push­ing the con­spir­acy the­ory were com­men­ta­tor Can­dace Owens, Ge­or­gia lawyer L. Lin Wood and Ms Juanita Broad­drick, a nurs­ing home ad­min­is­tra­tor who in 1999 pub­licly ac­cused then Pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton of rap­ing her in 1978. Other prom­i­nent fig­ures spread­ing the rumour in­cluded Mr Ken Pax­ton, the at­tor­ney-gen­eral of Texas; Ms Sarah Palin, the for­mer vice-pres­i­den­tial can­di­date; and Repub­li­can Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Mo Brooks of Alabama.</p>
    <p>As the siege of the Capi­tol es­ca­lated on Wed­nes­day, civil rights groups, in­clud­ing The An­tiDefama­tion League and Colour Of Change, called for so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies to sus­pend Mr Trump’s ac­counts per­ma­nently.</p>
    <p>For­mer Face­book se­cu­rity chief Alex Sta­mos like­wise tweeted: “Twit­ter and Face­book have to cut him off.”</p>
