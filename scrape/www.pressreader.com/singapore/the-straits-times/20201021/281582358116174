    <p>Sin­ga­pore could en­ter the third phase of its re­open­ing by the end of the year, pro­vided that com­mu­nity cases re­main low as the coun­try steps up Covid-19 test­ing and con­tact trac­ing. As part of phase three, the per­mit­ted size of gath­er­ings out­side homes could be in­creased from five peo­ple to eight.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could en­ter the third phase of its re­open­ing by the end of the year, pro­vided that com­mu­nity cases re­main low as the coun­try steps up Covid-19 test­ing and con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>As part of phase three, the per­mit­ted size of gath­er­ings out­side homes could be in­creased from five peo­ple to eight, said the multi-min­istry task force han­dling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, house­holds could be al­lowed to have up to eight vis­i­tors at a time, en­abling larger fam­i­lies to con­gre­gate.</p>
    <p>On top of that, ca­pac­ity lim­its in venues such as mu­se­ums and places of wor­ship and for wed­ding re­cep­tions may be in­creased, with mul­ti­ple zones of 50 peo­ple per­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>But to en­ter phase three, Sin­ga­pore will have to keep its guard up and meet sev­eral key con­di­tions, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter and task force cochair Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day, as he laid out the coun­try’s road map to the fi­nal phase of its re­open­ing amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>First, Sin­ga­pore­ans will still have to stick to safe man­age­ment mea­sures, in­clud­ing keep­ing to small group sizes, prac­tis­ing safe dis­tanc­ing and ex­er­cis­ing so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity, such as by wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Next, Covid-19 test­ing will be car­ried out on a larger scale to al­low more ac­tiv­i­ties to re­sume.</p>
    <p>For starters, a pilot scheme will use a rapid test to ex­am­ine peo­ple for the virus be­fore they are al­lowed to at­tend larger-scale and high­er­risk events. This pilot pro­gramme will be fine-tuned and ex­panded if it proves suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>Lastly, there needs to be a higher take-up rate for the Trace To­gether</p>
    <p>If we work to­gether, co­op­er­ate and com­ply with the re­quire­ments and the mea­sures, then we can keep com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion rates low and there is a chance that we can en­ter phase three be­fore the end of the year... If we let our guard down and new clus­ters emerge, then this time­line will have to be pushed back.</p>
    <p>ED­U­CA­TION MIN­IS­TER LAWRENCE WONG, on the need for cau­tion.</p>
    <p>pro­gramme, with more venues re­quir­ing peo­ple to check in for Safe En­try via Trace To­gether, to strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s con­tact trac­ing regime.</p>
    <p>Th­ese mea­sures will be im­ple­mented pro­gres­sively, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, who cochairs the task force with Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>How­ever, nightlife set­tings deemed as places with higher risk – such as bars, karaoke lounges and night­clubs – are likely to stay closed even at the start of phase three.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry added in a sep­a­rate state­ment that phase three will not mean a re­turn to the pre-coro­n­avirus world.</p>
    <p>“It will en­tail new ways of work­ing and liv­ing, un­til the world has the virus un­der tight con­trol,” it said, adding that Sin­ga­pore­ans have to be pre­pared to stay in phase three for a pro­longed pe­riod, po­ten­tially more than a year. Ac­tiv­i­ties could be scaled up or more may re­sume dur­ing this phase.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the sit­u­a­tion was like a fire that is re­duced to em­bers but not to­tally ex­tin­guished. Re­lax­ing rules adds fuel to th­ese em­bers, he said, and raises the risk that the fire may flare up again.</p>
    <p>That is why mea­sures have to be re­laxed with ad­di­tional safe­guards in place, such as more test­ing and track­ing, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>“When can all of th­ese mea­sures take place? That is the big ques­tion. And the an­swer is that it re­ally de­pends on all of us,” he said.</p>
    <p>If the trans­mis­sion rate re­mains low, Sin­ga­pore could en­ter phase three be­fore the end of this year. But if new clus­ters emerge, the time­line will have to be pushed back, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan added that even when Sin­ga­pore en­ters phase three, peo­ple must keep their guard up.</p>
    <p>“Phase three is not a dec­la­ra­tion of vic­tory that we have now suc­ceeded in over­com­ing Covid-19, and all of us should go around cel­e­brat­ing and for­get about all the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Phase three is... a mile­stone, that we are say­ing that we have now put in place rea­son­able safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures... to pro­tect our­selves and we should con­tinue to main­tain th­ese safe­guards.”</p>
    <p>Up to eight peo­ple could be al­lowed to gather out­side their homes when Sin­ga­pore moves into phase three of its re­open­ing, the mul­ti­min­istry task force han­dling Covid-19 said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Asked how the task force ar­rived at this fig­ure, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong re­sponded that safe dis­tanc­ing was a con­cern.</p>
    <p>The task force had ini­tially con­sid­ered in­creas­ing the limit to 10 in­stead of eight, he said.</p>
    <p>But in pub­lic places like restau­rants, hav­ing groups of 10 would make it more dif­fi­cult for pa­trons to main­tain a cer­tain dis­tance from one an­other, he added.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing from five to eight was there­fore seen as a rea­son­able in­crease that was more man­age­able.</p>
    <p>“We also do not want to have a sud­den in­crease with a large num­ber, and as a re­sult, then we end up with big clus­ters of trans­mis­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the task force set out Sin­ga­pore’s road map to phase three, which could hap­pen by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Apart from in­creas­ing the group size of so­cial gath­er­ings out­side homes, house­holds may also be able to wel­come eight vis­i­tors in­stead of five.</p>
    <p>“I would have liked to stay at five, but of course, I think five is quite stress­ful for quite a lot of peo­ple and es­pe­cially fam­i­lies with a large num­ber of mem­bers,” Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>He added that Sin­ga­pore can af­ford to in­crease gath­er­ing sizes as long as peo­ple stay vig­i­lant and ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The num­ber may be tweaked as time goes on, he said.</p>
    <p>In phase three, ca­pac­ity lim­its in venues such as mu­se­ums, places of wor­ship and wed­ding re­cep­tions may be in­creased, with mul­ti­ple zones of 50 per­sons al­lowed.</p>
    <p>But the nightlife in­dus­try, which is deemed as a higher-risk set­ting, will not restart even when phase three be­gins, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the task force.</p>
    <p>“All in all, we have been at this for, I think, al­most nine months now. I know it seems like a life­time to some of us, and many peo­ple are feel­ing tired and fa­tigued,” he said.</p>
    <p>But he stressed that the fight is far from over, with coun­tries all around the world ex­pe­ri­enc­ing spikes in the num­ber of virus cases.</p>
    <p>“The hope for a vac­cine is there. There are promis­ing can­di­dates, but the jour­ney to­wards dis­tribut­ing a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine to bil­lions of peo­ple around the world will take a long time,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally have to gird our­selves for a long fight, and we should take that per­spec­tive in look­ing at this is­sue. This is not some­thing we can over­come within one or two months,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally have to be pre­pared for the long haul and con­tinue with our vig­i­lant, dis­ci­plined ap­proach in main­tain­ing all the nec­es­sary mea­sures and al­low­ing us to pro­gres­sively re­open and re­sume ac­tiv­i­ties safely.”</p>
