    <p>AO BROTH</p>
    <p>WHAT: Fish col­la­gen broth</p>
    <p>SALES PITCH: The broth is made with garoupa, chicken and pork bones, with salt, pep­per and some rock su­gar. It has no monosodium glu­ta­mate (MSG) or preser­va­tives and is gluten and dairy-free. It is made in small batches and the broth is sim­mered for more than eight hours. NU­TRI­TION: A 250ml serv­ing has 68 calo­ries, 10.2g of pro­tein, 3g of fat, 0g of car­bo­hy­drate and 478mg of sodium.</p>
    <p>PRICE: $28 for 1 litre WHERE TO OR­DER: ao­broth.com</p>
    <p>TASTE TEST: De­spite my mis­giv­ings about the fish bones that go into the broth, the flavour is not fishy at all. In fact, it is light and nat­u­rally sweet. This is per­fect for fish and seafood soup, or as a base for paella.</p>
    <p>CHU COL­LA­GEN</p>
    <p>WHAT: Chicken col­la­gen soup</p>
    <p>SALES PITCH: Made with chicken bones, salt and gin­ger, the broth is dou­ble-boiled for eight hours. It has no trans fat, su­gar, MSG, preser­va­tives, ad­di­tives or ar­ti­fi­cial flavour­ings. NU­TRI­TION: A 250ml serv­ing has 532 calo­ries, 23g of pro­tein,</p>
    <p>49g of fat, 0g of car­bo­hy­drate and 645mg of sodium.</p>
    <p>PRICE: $28 for 1 litre</p>
    <p>WHERE TO OR­DER: chu­col­la­gen.com</p>
    <p>TASTE TEST: The thick­est and salti­est of the three, this broth has a good chicken flavour. I would di­lute it and use it to make risotto, con­gee and steam­boat.</p>
    <p>YUAN COL­LA­GEN SOUP</p>
    <p>WHAT: Chicken col­la­gen soup</p>
    <p>SALES PITCH: Slow-boiled for more than 10 hours, us­ing chicken bones, onions, gar­lic, gin­ger, pep­per and salt. It is also su­gar-free.</p>
    <p>NU­TRI­TION: A 250ml serv­ing has 285 calo­ries, 25g of pro­tein,</p>
    <p>20g of fat, 0g of car­bo­hy­drate and 332.5mg of sodium.</p>
    <p>PRICE: $25 for 1 litre WHERE TO OR­DER: yuan­foods.com</p>
    <p>TASTE TEST: This one has the most ro­bust taste of the three, and the chicken flavour comes through loud and clear. The flavour­ings are neu­tral enough that you can use it for many kinds of dishes, Asian or oth­er­wise. I think it would be great for a chicken stew or as a base for a dou­ble-boiled soup with Chi­nese herbs. When peo­ple talk about chicken soup for the soul, this is what they mean.</p>
