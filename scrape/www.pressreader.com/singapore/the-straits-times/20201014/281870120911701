    <p>•</p>
    <p>US vot­ers have cast more than 10 mil­lion votes for the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, sig­nif­i­cantly out­pac­ing the early vote in 2016 and sug­gest­ing a large turnout, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by the US Elec­tions Pro­ject.</p>
    <p>The surge in early vot­ing comes amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has led to more early and mail bal­lot­ing, par­tic­u­larly among Democrats.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has sowed con­fu­sion and dis­trust of mail bal­lot­ing, mak­ing re­peated, un­founded al­le­ga­tions of wide­spread fraud ahead of his con­test with Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Biden.</p>
    <p>As of Mon­day night, nearly 10.4 mil­lion Amer­i­cans had cast a vote in states that re­port early vot­ing data, ac­cord­ing to the elec­tion in­for­ma­tion re­source at the Univer­sity of Florida. By com­par­i­son, as of Oct 16, 2016, only about 1.4 mil­lion Amer­i­cans had cast an early vote.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of bal­lots cast in five states – Min­nesota, South Dakota, Ver­mont, Vir­ginia and Wis­con­sin – had al­ready ex­ceeded 20 per cent of to­tal 2016 turnout.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the United States, the Cal­i­for­nia Repub­li­can Party ad­mit­ted re­spon­si­bil­ity for plac­ing more than 50 de­cep­tively la­belled “of­fi­cial” drop boxes for mail-in bal­lots in Los An­ge­les, Fresno and Orange coun­ties – an ac­tion that state of­fi­cials said was il­le­gal and could lead to voter fraud.</p>
    <p>The dark grey me­tal boxes have been pop­ping up over the past two weeks near churches, gun shops and Repub­li­can Party offices, mostly in con­ser­va­tive ar­eas of a deep-blue state, af­fixed with a white pa­per la­bel iden­ti­fy­ing them as ei­ther an “Of­fi­cial Bal­lot Dropoff Box” or a “Bal­lot Drop Box”.</p>
    <p>To the av­er­age voter, they are vir­tu­ally in­dis­tin­guish­able from drop-off sites ap­proved by the state, which are gov­erned by strict reg­u­la­tions i ntended to pre­vent the par­ti­san ma­nip­u­la­tion of bal­lots.</p>
    <p>The ac­tions of the largely marginalis­ed state party come at a time when Repub­li­cans and Democrats are en­gaged in a bit­ter na­tional strug­gle over vot­ing rights, with Mr Trump’s al­lies ac­cus­ing Democrats in Min­nesota and else­where of un­der­min­ing the integrity of the elec­toral process by ex­pand­ing ab­sen­tee vot­ing and other mea­sures to in­crease bal­lot ac­cess.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Cal­i­for­nia’s sec­re­tary of state, Mr Alex Padilla, and At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Xavier Be­cerra sent a cease-and-de­sist or­der to the state- and county-level Repub­li­can par­ties, or­der­ing them to re­move the boxes. They urged peo­ple who might have un­know­ingly dropped off their bal­lots in the re­cep­ta­cles to sign up with the state’s voter-track­ing web­site to en­sure their votes are counted.</p>
    <p>“Mis­lead­ing vot­ers is wrong re­gard­less of who is do­ing it,” Mr Padilla said, adding that the boxes “are not per­mit­ted by state law”.</p>
    <p>Mr Be­cerra called the boxes “fake”, adding that it was “il­le­gal to tam­per with a cit­i­zen’s vote”. He warned that any­one “en­gag­ing in this ac­tiv­ity” could be sub­ject to crim­i­nal pros­e­cu­tion or civil ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia Repub­li­can Party spokesman Hec­tor Bara­jas said the party would con­tinue to dis­trib­ute the boxes, with­out adding any la­bel iden­ti­fy­ing them ex­plic­itly as Repub­li­can bal­lot drops.</p>
    <p>Mr Bara­jas – who dis­closed that Repub­li­cans were re­spon­si­ble for the boxes only af­ter be­ing bom­barded by ques­tions by re­porters on Mon­day – said the party’s ac­tions were le­gal be­cause state law did not re­strict “bal­lot har­vest­ing”, a prac­tice that al­lows busi­nesses or other or­gan­i­sa­tions to col­lect batches of com­pleted bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and his sup­port­ers had de­cried the prac­tice as cor­rupt when Democrats were ac­cused of col­lect­ing bun­dles of bal­lots, which is le­gal in 26 states but sub­ject to ver­i­fi­ca­tion re­quire­ments.</p>
