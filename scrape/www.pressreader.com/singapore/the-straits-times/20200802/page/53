        Insight | | B5 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 2, 2020 stakes for Asia Election timeline AUG 11 Connecticu­t’s primary election, the last primary of the year. AUG 17-20 Democratic National Convention. Mr Joe Biden will travel to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to accept his party ’s nomination, but the event will be held largely online. AUG 24-27 Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. The event will be on a smaller scale and possibly also streamed online, but President Donald Trump said he will still be present to accept the Republican nomination. Originally to be held entirely in North Carolina, the convention was partially moved to Jacksonvil­le, Florida, although the Jacksonvil­le portions of the event were later cancelled. MID-SEPTEMBER Early voting begins in several states, including Michigan, Pennsylvan­ia, Virginia and Wyoming, some as early as 45 to 50 days before election day. SEPT 29 First presidenti­al debate between Mr Trump and Mr Biden, in Cleveland, Ohio. These presidenti­al and vice-presidenti­al debates are typically broadcast live on television and the Internet. OCT 7 Vice-presidenti­al debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. OCT 15 Second presidenti­al debate in Miami, Florida. OCT 22 Third and final presidenti­al debate in Nashville, Tennessee. NOV 3 Election day. Experts warn that final results in many states may not be known on election night but announced over the next few days because of this year ’s spike in mail-in ballots, which take longer to count. DEC 14 Meeting of the Electoral College, which will formally vote for the president and vice-president. JAN 3, 2021 The new Congress convenes. JAN 20 Inaugurati­on Day.
