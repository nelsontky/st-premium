    <p>COLOMBO • The dis­tressed oil tanker MT New Di­a­mond, which caught fire in the seas off Sri Lanka’s east­ern coast on Thurs­day, has been towed 70km away from shore and the fire is un­der con­trol, the Sri Lanka Navy said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The oil tanker was head­ing to Paradip Port in In­dia car­ry­ing 270,000 met­ric tonnes of crude oil from Kuwait when a fire broke out in its en­gine room, threat­en­ing to cause a mas­sive oil spill in the In­dian Ocean.</p>
    <p>The navy said that by Fri­day evening, sev­eral ships and tugs were en­gaged in fire­fight­ing ef­forts. As of yes­ter­day morn­ing, there was no threat of an oil leak as ef­forts were un­der way to pre­vent the fire from reach­ing the cargo area.</p>
