    <p>The Pri­mary 1 reg­is­tra­tion ex­er­cise is stress­ful for most par­ents in Sin­ga­pore, and can lead to sleep­less nights and even­tual dis­ap­point­ment. I would like the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion to look into the al­lo­ca­tion of places in Phase 2B, which is for chil­dren whose par­ents are school vol­un­teers, ac­tive com­mu­nity lead­ers or are en­dorsed by the church or clan di­rectly con­nected to the school.</p>
    <p>As a par­ent con­cerned about my child’s pri­mary school ed­u­ca­tion, I would nat­u­rally take the route of vol­un­teer­ing at a pri­mary school to get my child a place there.</p>
    <p>But I feel that it is harsh to still make par­ents who have in­vested time and ef­fort in vol­un­teer­ing go through bal­lot­ing. Af­ter tak­ing time off from work and ar­rang­ing for al­ter­na­tive child­care to put in the re­quired hours at the school, it is such a dis­ap­point­ment to end up un­suc­cess­ful in the bal­lot­ing.</p>
    <p>Some fam­i­lies even move to be closer to the school af­ter the par­ent starts vol­un­teer­ing, and end up wast­ing their time and money.</p>
    <p>This feels un­nec­es­sary; if a par­ent has been ac­cepted by the school as a vol­un­teer, then it should re­serve a place for the child upon com­ple­tion of the re­quired hours. If not, then schools should re­strict the num­ber of vol­un­teers they ac­cept each year.</p>
