    <p>DI­VORCE CON­FIRMED: Chi­nese ac­tress Zhou Xun and Chi­nese-Amer­i­can ac­tor Archie Kao (both right) have con­firmed their di­vorce af­ter ru­mours of their split swirled in the past three years.</p>
    <p>Zhou, 46, mar­ried Kao, 51, in 2014, but they have rarely been seen to­gether in pub­lic since 2016 and have had al­most no in­ter­ac­tion with each other on so­cial me­dia since 2017.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day night, a photo of Kao kiss­ing a long-haired woman was widely cir­cu­lated on­line.</p>
    <p>There was also a love let­ter from the woman posted on In­sta­gram, in which she ad­dressed Kao as “my love” and wrote in English: “There might be mil­lions of roses in the whole world, but I am your only one, unique rose.” The In­sta­gram ac­count has since been set to pri­vate.</p>
    <p>The two photos im­me­di­ately started tongues wag­ging again.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Zhou, who starred as con­sort Ruyi in the 2018 tele­vi­sion se­rial, Ruyi’s Royal Love In The Palace, posted a mes­sage on Weibo wish­ing Kao well.</p>
    <p>In what was pos­si­bly a co­or­di­nated ges­ture, he posted an iden­ti­cal mes­sage to her three min­utes later.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor con­firmed the di­vorce with Tai­wan’s Ap­ple Daily through a good friend, with the news­pa­per say­ing he and Zhou di­vorced two years ago.</p>
    <p>“I am sur­prised to re­ceive so much at­ten­tion to­day as I thought ev­ery­one was aware of our di­vorce,” he was quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>He said he is sin­gle, as Ap­ple Daily said the woman in the photo was his ex-girl­friend, whom he dated af­ter his di­vorce.</p>
    <p>He broke up with her more than two months ago in the United States, ac­cord­ing to the news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Kao said he ini­tially did not want to ad­dress the mat­ter, but de­cided to do so af­ter the photos were posted.</p>
    <p>There were me­dia re­ports which said the woman is a Sin­ga­porean flight at­ten­dant who is about 30 years old and liv­ing in Taipei.</p>
