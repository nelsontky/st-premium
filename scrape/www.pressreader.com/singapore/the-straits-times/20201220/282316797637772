    <p>It is no se­cret that many Sin­ga­pore­ans are glued to their phones, but this is the year we have had to whip them out more than usual.</p>
    <p>To com­bat the trans­mis­sion of Covid-19, the Gov­ern­ment launched sev­eral tech ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>One of them is SafeEn­try, a na­tional dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem that logs the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion and mo­bile num­bers of in­di­vid­u­als vis­it­ing venues to aid con­tact trac­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>At the en­try or exit points of th­ese places, in­di­vid­u­als check in or out by scan­ning a QR code and sub­mit­ting their per­sonal par­tic­u­lars us­ing the SingPass Mo­bile app, their phone’s cam­era func­tion or a QR scan­ner app. They can also scan their iden­ti­fi­ca­tion or Pas­sion cards or driver’s li­cence.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment also launched the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme to speed up con­tact trac­ing and im­prove its ac­cu­racy.</p>
    <p>You use ei­ther the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken (right), both of which use Blue­tooth sig­nals to de­tect and record prox­im­ity data of other TraceTo­gether users. Such prox­im­ity records help con­tact trac­ers es­tab­lish close con­tacts more quickly and ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>The TraceTo­gether app can also be used to scan SafeEn­try QR codes.</p>
    <p>The first batch of TraceTo­gether</p>
    <p>Tto­kens was given out to a se­lect group of 10,000 se­niors in June. Since Sept 14, dis­tri­bu­tion to all Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents has been on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>On Oct 20, it was an­nounced that check-in for SafeEn­try with the TraceTo­gether app or free to­ken, also known as TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try (TT-only SE), will be manda­tory at pop­u­lar venues in­clud­ing eater­ies and malls.</p>
    <p>It will be com­pul­sory at all public venues early next year. The Gov­ern­ment has as­sured the public that TT-only SE will not be im­ple­mented un­til ev­ery­one who wants a to­ken has had the chance to col­lect one.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, TT-only SE is be­ing pi­loted at se­lected venues such as cin­e­mas and some places of wor­ship.</p>
