    <p>There has not been a live or­ches­tral con­cert in Sin­ga­pore since midMarch, be­fore cir­cuit breaker and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures made grouped per­for­mances im­pos­si­ble. There were con­certs on the In­ter­net, but mostly of pre-recorded per­for­mances. In June, a break­through took the form of a live con­cert by the Con­cor­dia Quar­tet, whose four mem­bers per­formed from dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions for a live In­ter­net au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Its par­ent or­gan­i­sa­tion, re:Sound, has gone sev­eral steps fur­ther by pre­sent­ing a live cham­ber orches­tra con­cert with a full sym­phony to boot. Twenty-three mu­si­cians were gath­ered into spa­ces of an Or­chard Road lo­ca­tion where they per­formed, so­cially dis­tanced, wear­ing head­phones and masked (wind play­ers ex­cepted). As they played, the won­ders of mod­ern dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy en­sured that their ef­forts were be­ing ap­pre­ci­ated by on­line view­ers.</p>
    <p>One pos­i­tive out­come of this pan­demic has been to wit­ness the sheer in­ge­nu­ity of peo­ple who live for art, want to make good mu­sic and share it with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The 50-minute con­cert opened with English com­poser Peter War­lock’s Capriol Suite (1926) for strings. Its six move­ments were based on French re­nais­sance dances, brought up to date with mod­ern har­monies and oc­ca­sional dis­so­nances. The 14 string mu­si­cians were sep­a­rated into four rooms, where they essen­tially played “blind”, un­able to see the other groups, but able to hear them.</p>
    <p>De­spite the dis­ad­van­tage, they pro­duced a clear and ho­mo­ge­neous sound in the open­ing Basse-Danse soon af­ter leader vi­o­lin­ist Ed­ward Tan gave the three-count to be­gin. The presto 4th move­ment (Bransles) was fol­lowed by the ten­der Pieds-en-l’air and vig­or­ous Mat­tachins (Sword Dance), which pro­vided enough con­trasts for the suite to close with ap­pro­pri­ate plau­dits.</p>
    <p>The main event was Mozart’s pop­u­lar Sym­phony No. 40 In G Mi­nor, with wood­winds and brass thrown into the fray. A di­vi­sion of labour saw th­ese mu­si­cians play­ing in two fur­ther rooms, with the pair of bas­soons (a hus­band-and-wife cou­ple) se­questered into a stu­dio just big­ger than a broom closet.</p>
    <p>There was no con­duc­tor, in­stead the mu­si­cians re­lied on low strings to be­gin and for the oth­ers to join in. En­sem­ble could be tighter but, given the cir­cum­stances, the re­sults were more than ac­cept­able. Tem­pos were not overly brisk, with a com­fort­able pace adopted, surely pre­de­ter­mined in ear­lier re­hearsals. Yet there was still a pal­pa­ble sense of ten­sion and ur­gency in the 1 st move­ment’s de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The slow 2nd move­ment did not drag but main­tained an unerring course, a sign of an en­sem­ble gain­ing in con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>The Menuetto was suit­ably jaunty, but the French horns had hairy mo­ments of in­to­na­tion in the Trio sec­tion.</p>
    <p>The rol­lick­ing fi­nale was taken at a fair lick, en­sur­ing a height­ened level of ex­cite­ment, which turned into sus­pense when the vi­o­lists dis­ap­peared from view.</p>
    <p>Tech­ni­cal glitch or no, the mu­sic surged on re­gard­less to close on an ex­ul­tant high.</p>
