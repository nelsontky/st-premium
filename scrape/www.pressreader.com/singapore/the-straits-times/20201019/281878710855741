    <p>BAKU/YERE­VAN Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan ac­cused each other yes­ter­day of vi­o­lat­ing a new hu­man­i­tar­ian truce in fight­ing over the moun­tain en­clave of Nagorno-Karabakh, hours af­ter it was agreed.</p>
    <p>The cease­fire agreed to last Satur­day took ef­fect at mid­night af­ter a week-old Rus­sian-bro­kered truce failed to halt the worst fight­ing in the South Cau­ca­sus since the 1990s. At least 750 peo­ple have been killed since fight­ing be­gan on Sept 27.</p>
    <p>At 1010 GMT, the Az­eri De­fence Min­istry said the Agh­dam re­gion, ad­ja­cent to Nagorno-Karabakh, was un­der Ar­me­nian shelling. It said that, overnight, Ar­me­nian mil­i­tary units opened fire from large­cal­i­bre weapons along the bor­der. Yere­van has de­nied this.</p>
    <p>The Ar­me­nian De­fence Min­istry said the Az­eri army had fired twice dur­ing the night and used ar­tillery, ac­cus­ing Baku of re­ject­ing its re­quest to with­draw the wounded sol­diers from the bat­tle­field.</p>
    <p>“This step... was cat­e­gor­i­cally re­jected by Baku,” the For­eign Min­istry said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Baku called the state­ment mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The Az­eri De­fence Min­istry said: “The en­emy fired at the vicin­ity of the Jabrayil city, as well as the vil­lages of this re­gion... us­ing mor­tars and ar­tillery.” It added that the Az­eri army “took ad­e­quate re­tal­ia­tory mea­sures”.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said Az­eri mil­i­tary units downed an Ar­me­nian Su-25 war­plane “which was at­tempt­ing to in­flict airstrikes on the po­si­tions of the Az­eri army in Jabrayil re­gion”.</p>
    <p>Yere­van swiftly de­nied that.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in Nagorno-Karabakh said Az­eri forces had launched an at­tack on the en­clave’s mil­i­tary po­si­tions and that there were ca­su­al­ties and wounded on both sides.</p>
    <p>Nagorno-Karabakh is a moun­tain ter­ri­tory that is in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised as part of Azer­bai­jan but pop­u­lated and gov­erned by eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans. The cease­fire ear­lier this month was aimed at let­ting the sides ex­change de­tainees and the bod­ies of those killed in the clashes, but it had lit­tle im­pact on the fight­ing around the en­clave.</p>
    <p>The new cease­fire was an­nounced last Satur­day af­ter Rus­sian For­eign Min­is­ter Sergei Lavrov talked to his Ar­me­nian and Az­eri coun­ter­parts by phone and called on both sides to ob­serve the truce that he me­di­ated a week ago.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia, France and the United States be­long to the Minsk Group, which has at­tempted to help re­solve the con­flict un­der the um­brella of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Se­cu­rity and Co­op­er­a­tion in Europe.</p>
    <p>Baku said last Satur­day that 60 Az­eri civil­ians had been killed and 270 wounded since the fight­ing flared on Sept 27. It has not dis­closed its mil­i­tary ca­su­al­ties.</p>
    <p>Nagorno-Karabakh says 633 of its mil­i­tary staff have been killed. It also said at least six civil­ians in Stepanaker­t, the re­gion’s big­gest city, had been wounded by Az­eri shelling.</p>
