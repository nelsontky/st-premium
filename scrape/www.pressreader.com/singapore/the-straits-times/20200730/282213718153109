    <p>A Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany un­law­fully sup­plied l ux­ury i tems worth more than $6 mil­lion to North Korea, and its ship­ping man­ager failed to alert the au­thor­i­ties about these trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Grace Lim said that due to United Na­tions sanc­tions, it is il­le­gal for a per­son in Sin­ga­pore to sup­ply, sell or trans­fer des­ig­nated lux­ury items to any­one in North Korea. These in­clude wines, cos­met­ics and per­fumes.</p>
    <p>Any­one who has i nfor­ma­tion about such trans­ac­tions must alert the au­thor­i­ties, said the DPP.</p>
    <p>For fail­ing to do so, In­done­sian Sherly Mu­li­awan, 41, who worked for gen­eral whole­sale trade firm T Spe­cial­ist In­ter­na­tional, was fined $10,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She pleaded guilty to five charges un­der the UN Act in­volv­ing lux­ury goods worth more than $1.4 mil­lion in total. Seventy-four other sim­i­lar charges linked to the re­main­ing amount were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The DPP said Sin­ga­porean Ng Kheng Wah, 56, was a di­rec­tor and sole de­ci­sion-maker for the firm. It di­rectly sup­plied the lux­ury items to the Korean Bugsae Shop in North Korea from Novem­ber 2010 to Jan­uary 2017.</p>
    <p>The shop is owned by North Korean Li Ik, whose son, Li Hyon, had stud­ied in Sin­ga­pore be­fore help­ing his fa­ther with the busi­ness here. DPP Lim said the items were sent to North Korea via trans-ship­ment through Dalian in China.</p>
    <p>Ng had de­lib­er­ately con­cealed the fact that they were des­tined for North Korea by fail­ing to de­clare the fi­nal port of de­liv­ery to Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms.</p>
    <p>DPP Lim added that Li Ik, and later Li Hyon, would ar­range for pay­ment to be made to T Spe­cial­ist through front com­pa­nies in China and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Sherly took in­struc­tions from Ng. Her j ob scope in­cluded sourc­ing the lux­ury items and en­sur­ing that the Korean Bugsae Shop made pay­ments.</p>
    <p>In July 2017, she be­came aware of neg­a­tive news on North Korea and its nu­clear ac­tiv­i­ties. She also came across a news ar­ti­cle stat­ing that Ng, through his firm, had ex­ported sanc­tioned lux­ury goods there.</p>
    <p>She failed to alert the au­thor­i­ties about the trans­ac­tions even af­ter reading the re­port, said the DPP.</p>
    <p>Ng was sen­tenced to 34 months’ jail in Novem­ber last year af­ter plead­ing guilty to 10 counts each of cheat­ing and il­le­gally sup­ply­ing lux­ury items to North Korea.</p>
    <p>T Spe­cial­ist was fined $880,000.</p>
