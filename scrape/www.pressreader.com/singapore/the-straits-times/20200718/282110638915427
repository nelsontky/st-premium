    <p>Four con­tracts worth a to­tal of $682.5 mil­lion for the Jurong Re­gion Line (JRL) – in­clud­ing the de­sign and con­struc­tion of three sta­tions on the MRT line – were awarded by the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Worth $320.4 mil­lion, the first con­tract cov­ers the de­sign and con­struc­tion of Toh Guan, Jurong Town Hall and Pan­dan Reser­voir sta­tions, along with their el­e­vated viaducts span­ning 3.6km.</p>
    <p>It was awarded to a joint ven­ture be­tween Dae­woo Engi­neer­ing and Con­struc­tion and lo­cal con­trac­tor Yong­nam Engi­neer­ing and Con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>The Toh Guan sta­tion will cater to res­i­dents who live in Jurong East Cen­tral, as well as those who fre­quent its neigh­bour­ing places of wor­ship and ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions like Crest Sec­ondary School.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, peo­ple who work at the In­ter­na­tional Busi­ness Park will ben­e­fit from shorter trav­el­ling times with the con­struc­tion of the Jurong Town Hall sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Sited ad­ja­cent to Com­mon­wealth Sec­ondary School, the Pan­dan Reser­voir sta­tion will serve res­i­dents in ar­eas such as Pan­dan Gar­den Es­tate, Te­ban Gar­dens and West Coast Road.</p>
    <p>The JRL will in­clude Boon Lay sta­tion, which will con­nect to the ex­ist­ing Boon Lay sta­tion on the EastWest Line.</p>
    <p>Trav­el­ling time to Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, for in­stance, will be cut by about 20 min­utes for res­i­dents in the vicin­ity of Pan­dan Reser­voir sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion of these three sta­tions, whose names are ten­ta­tive, is ex­pected to start later this year.</p>
    <p>At ap­prox­i­mately $215.5 mil­lion, the sec­ond con­tract was awarded to a con­sor­tium be­tween Sin­ga­pore’s Siemens Mo­bil­ity and Spain’s Siemens Rail Au­to­ma­tion for the pro­vi­sion of the sig­nalling sys­tem and half-height plat­form screen doors for the JRL.</p>
    <p>The sig­nalling sys­tem will sup­port fully-au­to­mated train op­er­a­tions, and it will be equipped with con­di­tion mon­i­tor­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties that will en­able pre­dic­tive main­te­nance of the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The Siemens sig­nalling tech­nol­ogy is be­ing used on the Down­town</p>
    <p>Line, and at sev­eral other met­ros around the world, such as the Este in Madrid and the Mar­maray Rail Tube Tun­nel in Is­tan­bul.</p>
    <p>LTA awarded two con­tracts to ST Engi­neer­ing Elec­tron­ics, at a com­bined value of around $146.6 mil­lion, for the pro­vi­sion of the in­te­grated su­per­vi­sory con­trol sys­tem (ISCS) and the com­mu­ni­ca­tions sys­tem for the JRL.</p>
    <p>The ISCS is the back­bone of a rail line’s re­mote su­per­vi­sion and con­trol sys­tem. It will al­low the op­er­a­tion con­trol cen­tre, de­pot con­trol cen­tre and pas­sen­ger ser­vice cen­tre to mon­i­tor elec­tri­cal and me­chan­i­cal sys­tems and ser­vices, as well as civil equip­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­ni­ca­tions sys­tem will in­clude dig­i­tal trunked ra­dio, video sur­veil­lance as well as travel in­for­ma­tion con­cern­ing the fully-au­to­mated train net­work.</p>
