    <p>Artist Lim Tze Peng may be turn­ing 99 next month, but he still has some firsts to look for­ward to – namely, hav­ing his first vir­tual ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>A Cen­tury Of Ink will go on­line on his birth­day, Sept 28. The ex­hi­bi­tion by gallery Ode To Art will fea­ture 20 of his new works.</p>
    <p>It will be sep­a­rated into three vir­tual gal­leries: one room for his ear­lier Sin­ga­pore scenes, one for his re­cent works from late last year to the present, and a fi­nal one for birth­day greet­ing videos from art col­lec­tors, who will also dis­play 100 of his works that would other­wise not be avail­able to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“I am grate­ful to Ode To Art for giv­ing me this op­por­tu­nity to con­nect with peo­ple in a safe way from their homes,” says Lim, a Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent, in an e-mail in­ter­view trans­lated from Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>Ahead of this, Ode To Art has put on another vir­tual ex­hi­bi­tion by a vet­eran artist, Be­com­ing And Be­ing by Hong Zhu An.</p>
    <p>The 65-year-old, who was born in Shang­hai and has lived here for nearly 30 years, is known for his acrylic and ink paint­ings on Chi­nese rice paper. Be­com­ing And Be­ing fea­tures more than 40 new works.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal ex­hi­bi­tions in­clude vir­tual tours with au­dio nar­ra­tives and videos.</p>
    <p>Lim, the old­est liv­ing mem­ber of Sin­ga­pore’s sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion artists, con­tin­ues to paint every day and re­mains highly pro­lific de­spite his ad­vanced years.</p>
    <p>The son of farm­ers, he has been paint­ing since the 1950s, al­though he be­came a full-time artist only in 1981, af­ter he re­tired as a school prin­ci­pal. His work is prized for the way it cap­tures long-gone land­scapes, such as the Sin­ga­pore River be­fore it was cleaned up by the Govern­ment in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
    <p>In the past, he would paint en plein air (out­doors), but as this has proven too tax­ing on his health, he now paints from mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, the fa­ther of six stayed home to pro­tect his health and spend time with his fam­ily. He says: “See­ing Sin­ga­pore stand to­gether through trou­bled times re­minded me of the olden days and led me to paint more scenes of Chi­na­town and the Sin­ga­pore River from mem­ory.”</p>
    <p>“I am very lucky to have the en­ergy to paint every day. I have many ideas that I still want to de­velop in my art, so I think this is what drives me. I hope to paint ev­ery­thing that is in my mind’s eye, and I may need another life­time to do it all.”</p>
