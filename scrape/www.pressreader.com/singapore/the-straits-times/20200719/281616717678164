    <p>WASHINGTON • Amer­i­cans de­bated mask man­dates and the re­open­ing of schools dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic on Fri­day as state and lo­cal of­fi­cials im­posed con­flict­ing or­ders and cases rose by more than 70,000 across the na­tion for the sec­ond day in a row.</p>
    <p>The United States recorded a to­tal of at least 70,674 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions on Fri­day af­ter climb­ing by a record 77,499 a day ear­lier, the largest in­crease posted by any coun­try since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>US deaths on Fri­day rose by at least 912, the fourth day in a row that fa­tal­i­ties have ex­ceeded 900.</p>
    <p>In the state of Ge­or­gia, Gov­er­nor Brian Kemp sued At­lanta’s mayor to pre­vent her from man­dat­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Chicago Mayor Lori Light­foot an­nounced a plan to of­fer both in-per­son and re­mote in­struc­tion at the na­tion’s third-largest school dis­trict, over the ob­jec­tion of the teach­ers’ union, which wants re­mote learn­ing only.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans have be­come di­vided along po­lit­i­cal lines over mask or­ders, with con­ser­va­tives more likely than lib­er­als to call the rules a vi­o­la­tion of their Con­sti­tu­tional rights.</p>
    <p>Ms Sharon Tay­lor, 48, a car­dio­tho­racic nurse in At­lanta said: “Every­body’s say­ing that (wear­ing a mask) is a vi­o­la­tion of their free­dom – no, it’s not. Be­cause a seat belt is man­dated and that’s to save your life.”</p>
    <p>With school set to re­sume in a few weeks, lo­cal of­fi­cials across the coun­try have an­nounced a va­ri­ety of plans to re­sume teach­ing.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som, who un­til now has al­lowed school dis­tricts in the na­tion’s most pop­u­lous state to set their own poli­cies, said on Fri­day that schools could re­open only in coun­ties that for 14 days have stayed off a wors­en­ing trends watch list.</p>
    <p>As of Fri­day, 30 of the state’s 58 coun­ties were on the list and schools there must re­main closed. Among them are Los An­ge­les, Sacra­mento and San Diego coun­ties, ac­count­ing for nearly 40 per cent of the state’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The US has been av­er­ag­ing about 60,000 cases a day this month, with cases ris­ing in 41 states on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Texas and Arkansas re­ported a record num­ber of deaths on Fri­day, while Kansas, Ohio, North Dakota and Puerto Rico re­ported record num­bers of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has urged a re­turn to nor­mal, stress­ing the im­por­tance of reignit­ing the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and some health ex­perts ar­gue that chil­dren are bet­ter off in class­rooms for their de­vel­op­ment, and also to al­low par­ents to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump told Fox News on Fri­day that he did not be­lieve in im­ple­ment­ing a na­tional mask man­date.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, the na­tion’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist, urged po­lit­i­cal lead­ers to “be as force­ful as pos­si­ble in get­ting your cit­i­zenry to wear masks”.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami Beach, Florida, im­posed an 8pm cur­few in its en­ter­tain­ment dis­trict af­ter so­cial me­dia posts showed mask­less rev­ellers crammed into restau­rant pa­tios.</p>
    <p>Ok­la­homa City’s council voted in favour of an in­door mask re­quire­ment in the ab­sence of a statewide face-cov­er­ing man­date.</p>
    <p>In Ge­or­gia, Mr Kemp – a Re­pub­li­can and Trump sup­porter – urged all Ge­or­gians to wear masks for at least four weeks but said man­dates were un­en­force­able and sug­gested they would hob­ble the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Brian Kemp does the bid­ding of Pres­i­dent Trump,” At­lanta’s Demo­cratic Mayor Keisha Lance Bot­toms, who has tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, told CNN on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Charles, 68, of At­lanta, sided with the mayor on Fri­day as he wore a mask, all alone, sort­ing through his mail out­side a post of­fice.</p>
    <p>“It’s wrong,” Mr Charles said. “The mayor is try­ing to help peo­ple. This is a pan­demic. How much worse does he want it?”</p>
    <p>MAN­DATED TO SAVE LIVES</p>
    <p>Every­body’s say­ing that (wear­ing a mask) is a vi­o­la­tion of their free­dom – no, it’s not. Be­cause a seat belt is man­dated and that’s to save your life. ’’</p>
    <p>MS SHARON TAY­LOR, a car­dio­tho­racic nurse in At­lanta.</p>
