    <p>MOSCOW • Russia plans to reg­is­ter a coron­avirus vac­cine by Aug 10-12, clear­ing the way for what its back­ers say would be the world’s first of­fi­cial ap­proval of an in­oc­u­la­tion against the virus amid the epi­demic.</p>
    <p>The drug de­vel­oped by Moscow’s Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute and the Rus­sian</p>
    <p>Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund (RDIF) may be ap­proved for civil­ian use within three to seven days of reg­is­tra­tion by reg­u­la­tors, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the process, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Ga­ma­leya’s vac­cine is ex­pected to get con­di­tional reg­is­tra­tion next month, mean­ing the in­sti­tute will still need to con­duct tri­als on an­other 1,600 peo­ple, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Tatyana Go­likova said in a tele­vised meet­ing of of­fi­cials with Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion should be­gin in Septem­ber, she said.</p>
    <p>“The key re­quire­ments for a vac­cine are its proven ef­fec­tive­ness and safety, so ev­ery­thing needs to be done very carefully and ac­cu­rately,” Mr Putin said at the end of the meet­ing. “Our con­fi­dence in the vac­cine must be ab­so­lute.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, state news ser­vice RIA</p>
    <p>Novosti re­ported that the vac­cine may be ap­proved by Aug 15-16.</p>
    <p>While the vac­cine has been touted by its de­vel­op­ers as safe and po­ten­tially the first to reach the pub­lic, the data has not been pub­lished and the speed with which de­vel­op­ers are mov­ing has raised ques­tions in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ga­ma­leya is sched­uled to be­gin phase three tri­als next week in Russia, Saudi Ara­bia and the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>Russia has over 800,000 con­firmed Covid-19 cases, the fourth­most in the world. “Amer­i­cans were sur­prised when they heard Sput­nik’s beep­ing. It’s the same with this vac­cine. Russia will have got there first,” RDIF head Kir­ill Dmitriev told CNN.</p>
