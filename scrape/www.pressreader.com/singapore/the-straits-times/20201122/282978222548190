    <p>Lead­ing trainer Michael Cle­ments’ Sin­ga­pore Derby-Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup hero Top Knight was all the rage, but it was his up-and-com­ing light­weight hope Big Hearted who stole the show in the Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Gold Cup yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Both his horses moved up beau­ti­fully from the rear on the yield­ing track at the Kranji Race­course to go af­ter the Lee Freed­man-trained Min­is­ter, who had hit the front soon af­ter straight­en­ing.</p>
    <p>It was soon ev­i­dent the leader was vul­ner­a­ble over the 2,000m, $1 mil­lion, race.</p>
    <p>With the min­i­mum 50kg on his back and a great ride by reign­ing cham­pion apprentice jockey Si­mon Kok, Big Hearted pro­duced more to beat Min­is­ter (Ryan Munger) by half a length. The third fancy, he paid $42 for a win.</p>
    <p>Top Knight plugged on gal­lantly with the 57kg top load un­der cham­pion jockey Vlad Duric to fin­ish third. He was 1 3/ lengths away in</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s premier clas­sic, which was run be­hind closed doors be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>His de­feat meant an­other Gold Cup top­weight had fallen vic­tim to tra­di­tion. The last top­pie to win was Smart Bet 18 years ago.</p>
    <p>Since then, six horses have won with 50kg and many oth­ers un­der 53kg, be­cause of the hand­i­cap con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Big Hearted and Top Knight are owned by the for­mi­da­ble Thai out­fit, Fal­con Rac­ing No. 7 Sta­ble.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s Gold Cup suc­cess was the first for Cle­ments and Kok.</p>
    <p>There was a keen tus­sle for the lead, with six horses rac­ing past the win­ning post for the first time.</p>
    <p>Among them was Yu­long Edi­tion, who man­aged to cross in af­ter be­ing trapped wide to be a clear leader on the back straight.</p>
    <p>The $176 out­sider was fol­lowed by Derby run­ner-up Elite In­cred­i­ble and last week’s win­ner Senor Don. But he was a spent force at the top of the straight, as a few horses fanned out on his out­side.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter, who was handy for most of the way, soon hit the front. But he was no match for Big Hearted’s strong fin­ish. Still, he held on to beat Top Knight, the $12 favourite, for se­cond.</p>
    <p>The day started with beau­ti­ful weather. But the rain that came and de­layed Race 7 and the re­main­ing races by half an hour cer­tainly put the smile on Cle­ments’ face.</p>
    <p>“Top Knight and Big Hearted were win­ners on the wet track last start. When the rain came, it was wel­comed,” said Cle­ments.</p>
    <p>“Ear­lier on in the race, I felt Big Hearted was prob­a­bly a bit too far back. But Vlad, on Top Knight, was just in front of him. Vlad de­cided to make a move to make up ground and Si­mon just fol­lowed him. He’s get­ting 7kg from Top Knight, so he was ideal horse to get a lead on.</p>
    <p>“With 50m be­fore the straight, I could see both were start­ing to mo­tor home.</p>
    <p>“Half­way up the straight, Min­is­ter was still a long way in front, but they were fly­ing. I felt that we would have a very big chance of win­ning the race.</p>
    <p>“Within the last 1 00m, Big Hearted, as he is aptly named, re­ally dug deep and won a great race. Top Knight ran well, giv­ing 7kg to the win­ner.”</p>
    <p>Kok, who “felt too many emo­tions run­ning through my body”, said Big Hearted was not too happy with the ground on the back straight.</p>
    <p>“So I shifted back be­hind Top Knight and de­cided to fol­low him, be­cause he was the widest horse, and he got the best ground,” said the Malaysian rider.</p>
    <p>“He brought me beau­ti­fully into the race. Com­ing to the 500m, my horse had a bet­ter turn of foot be­cause of the light weight. That’s why he kicked away very strongly.</p>
    <p>“I was pretty con­fi­dent in the last 350m be­cause of his turn of foot.”</p>
