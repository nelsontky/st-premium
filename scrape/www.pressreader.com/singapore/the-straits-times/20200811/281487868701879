    <p>De­spite the pan­demic’s hit to the econ­omy and labour mar­ket, cer­tain sec­tors are still hir­ing for a range of non-ex­ec­u­tive po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Ware­hous­ing lo­gis­tics has emerged as the sec­tor with the strong­est de­mand for man­power in non-PMET (pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian) roles, ac­cord­ing to job por­tal FastJobs’ data.</p>
    <p>Based on the vol­ume of job post­ings in June and last month, af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, the sec­tor has over­taken re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity, which oc­cu­pied the top spots last year.</p>
    <p>FastJobs Sin­ga­pore gen­eral man­ager Lim Huis­han said com­pa­nies, es­pe­cially smaller play­ers, are start­ing to hire again af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ms An­gela Ang, group man­ager at em­ploy­ment firm MCI Ca­reer Ser­vices, said that with buy­ing habits shift­ing on­line, there is a de­mand for staff in the lo­gis­tics sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Roles like pack­ers, ware­house as­sis­tants and fork­lift driv­ers are in de­mand... Ware­house po­si­tions... can garner more than $2,000 in pay, and have be­come more at­trac­tive to candidates nowa­days.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ang pre­dicts sus­tained man­power de­mand in this sec­tor. “In the next few years, man­power in this sec­tor will also con­tinue to be in de­mand “as it will be some years be­fore the pro­cesses are fully au­to­mated”.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal­ity and food and bev­er­age (F&B) came in sec­ond, while gen­eral pro­duc­tion and op­er­a­tors ranked third, fol­lowed by clean­ing and house­keep­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Ang said there is in­creased de­mand for op­er­a­tors in ar­eas like man­u­fac­tur­ing due to bor­der re­stric­tions that re­sulted in a short­age of work­ers. “To sup­ple­ment, com­pa­nies are also in­creas­ing their hir­ing of short-term con­tract staff for three to six months. But the salary re­mains low, with a fixed gross of $1,200 to $1,600, ex­clud­ing over­time pay or bonuses.”</p>
    <p>Other types of non-PMET roles in de­mand now in­clude tech­ni­cians and those in de­liv­ery ser­vices and sales.</p>
    <p>Since June 2, over 3,000 compa</p>
    <p>EM­PLOYER’S MAR­KET</p>
    <p>Most job seek­ers un­der­stand that it is an em­ployer’s mar­ket... (and) are more will­ing to man­age their ex­pec­ta­tions within a 10 per cent to 20 per cent range from the pre-virus econ­omy, as with salary cuts seen in the cur­rent mar­ket. ’’</p>
    <p>MR DANNY SIAH, di­vi­sional man­ager of re­cruit­ment agency BGC Group.</p>
    <p>nies have been post­ing jobs on the FastJobs por­tal, an 87 per cent jump from the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod that lasted from April 7 to June 1.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of jobs posted from June 2 to July 14 ex­ceeded those posted dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker by 41 per cent, said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>But she noted that the F&B and re­tail sec­tors, tra­di­tion­ally big hir­ers, are see­ing a dip in ac­tiv­ity. How­ever, play­ers such as FairPrice, Dairy Farm Group, Don Don Donki and Bei­jing 101 con­tinue to have man­power de­mands.</p>
    <p>She said: “As re­tail stores and F&B started op­er­at­ing in the re­open­ing phase of the econ­omy, em­ploy­ers have needed to em­ploy ad­di­tional staff to ser­vice cus­tomers, al­beit typ­i­cally in fewer num­bers than they would have pre­vi­ously.”</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of com­pa­nies hir­ing is about 80 per cent of that for the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>“While there has been some re­cov­ery in the vol­ume of sales, re­tail and mar­ket­ing roles be­ing of­fered, year on year, the num­ber of jobs avail­able has halved. De­mand for ad­min­is­tra­tive and cler­i­cal staff, one of the most pop­u­lar sec­tors with job seek­ers, has also de­clined by more than 50 per cent,” Ms Lim ob­served.</p>
    <p>And while the vol­ume of jobs has shrunk, the num­ber of ap­pli­cants this year is up 25 per cent, she added.</p>
    <p>Most sec­tors also see fluc­tu­a­tions in me­dian salary of about $100. But the me­dian salary ad­ver­tised for de­liv­ery po­si­tions hit a high of $2,700 in April, be­fore fall­ing to $2,200 af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said job seek­ers are will­ing to ac­cept these fluc­tu­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Danny Siah, di­vi­sional man­ager of re­cruit­ment agency BGC Group, said: “Most job seek­ers un­der­stand that it is an em­ployer’s mar­ket in this cli­mate, where rel­e­vant job ex­pe­ri­ence plays the most im­por­tant role when it comes to salary ne­go­ti­a­tions. I sup­pose job seek­ers are more will­ing to man­age their ex­pec­ta­tions within a 10 per cent to 20 per cent range from the pre-virus econ­omy, as with salary cuts seen in the cur­rent mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for work­force so­lu­tions firm Kelly Ser­vices and Cap­i­tal said: “Given the cur­rent con­di­tion that brings along un­cer­tainty, we have ob­served that ac­tive job seek­ers are more flex­i­ble and re­cep­tive to con­tin­gent roles.”</p>
