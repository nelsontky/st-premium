    <p>Malaysia’s Health Min­istry has iden­ti­fied a new Covid-19 strain in the coun­try from sam­ples taken in Sabah state.</p>
    <p>The min­istry’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral, Tan Sri Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, said it is still un­known whether the strain – dubbed the “A701B” mu­ta­tion – is more in­fec­tious than usual.</p>
    <p>Is­rael, mean­while, has de­tected four cases of the new, highly in­fec­tious vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus that has emerged in Bri­tain, the Is­raeli Health Min­istry said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Noor Hisham, speak­ing about the strain found in Sabah, said on Wed­nes­day: “It is sim­i­lar to a strain found in South Africa, Aus­tralia and the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 virus al­ways mu­tates, and we are al­ways mon­i­tor­ing and re­search­ing the im­pli­ca­tion of the dif­fer­ent strains to­wards the pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We de­tected this mu­ta­tion in 60 sam­ples taken from Covid-19 pa­tients un­der the Ben­teng La­had Datu clus­ter in Sabah. We still have not as­cer­tained whether this strain has a high in­fec­tiv­ity level and whether it is more ag­gres­sive than usual.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia had pre­vi­ously dis­cov­ered a mu­ta­tion said to have 10 times more in­fec­tiv­ity than nor­mal strains, he said.</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to the D614G mu­ta­tion of Covid-19 that hit Kedah around Au­gust, and the north­ern state had then saw a rapid rise in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>On the Covid-19 mu­ta­tion found in Bri­tain, which is highly in­fec­tious, Dr Noor Hisham said the min­istry is mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment, how­ever, does not in­tend to back­track on the manda­tory quar­an­tine pe­riod, ow­ing to the dis­cov­ery of the mu­ta­tion in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>“If we look at the data of our quar­an­tine rul­ing, there is not much dif­fer­ence be­tween 10 days and 14 days of iso­la­tion,” said Dr Noor Hisham.</p>
    <p>“Most of the time, an in­di­vid­ual will de­velop symp­toms within the first week.</p>
    <p>“If the quar­an­tine pe­riod is only seven days, then maybe there is high risk, but 10 days or 14 days is not much dif­fer­ent, based on our ex­pe­ri­ence,” he added.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers ar­riv­ing in Malaysia from abroad have to un­dergo Covid-19 tests, and serve a quar­an­tine or­der if they test neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Those who test pos­i­tive will be sent to hospi­tal for iso­la­tion and treat­ment.</p>
    <p>In Is­rael, three of four cases de­tected were re­turnees from Eng­land. They are iso­lat­ing at a ho­tel des­ig­nated as a Covid-19 quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity, the Is­raeli Health Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The fourth case is un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion, it added.</p>
    <p>The new vari­ant of the SarsCoV-2 coro­n­avirus is spread­ing rapidly in Bri­tain and prompt­ing high lev­els of con­cern among its Euro­pean neigh­bours, some of which have cut trans­port links.</p>
    <p>Is­rael closed its borders to for­eign­ers in March, with some ex­cep­tions in­clud­ing stu­dents and jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>Un­der new re­stric­tions adopted this week, it nixed those ex­cep­tions for non-cit­i­zen ar­rivals from Bri­tain, South Africa and Den­mark, cit­ing the risk of the new coro­n­avirus strain.</p>
    <p>From Wed­nes­day evening un­til Jan 1, all Is­raelis who re­turn from abroad must iso­late at ho­tel quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to a di­rec­tive posted to the Health Min­istry’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Is­rael launched a coro­n­avirus vac­ci­na­tion drive last Satur­day and has vac­ci­nated 70,000 out of its pop­u­la­tion of nine mil­lion, gov­ern­ment data shows.</p>
