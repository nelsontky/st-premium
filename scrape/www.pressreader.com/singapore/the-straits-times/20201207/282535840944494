    <p>Pep Guardi­ola called on Manch­ester City’s de­fend­ers to keep up their mean streak as his side closed in on the Pre­mier League top four with a 2-0 win over Ful­ham on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Ra­heem Ster­ling’s first goal in seven games and a Kevin de Bruyne penalty in­side the first 26 min­utes en­sured a com­fort­able af­ter­noon, as City recorded backto-back wins in the league for the first time this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a dif­fi­cult start to the cam­paign caused by in­juries, Covid-19 cases and a short pre-sea­son, City trail Chelsea, who went top on Satur­day pro­vi­sion­ally with 22 points, by just four points and with a game in hand.</p>
    <p>On the lack of a clear favourite, City man­ager Guardi­ola said: “This sea­son looks like there will be a lot of teams in con­tention.</p>
    <p>“We strug­gled at the be­gin­ning of the sea­son for many rea­sons.</p>
    <p>“Now four games, four clean sheets. It’s so im­por­tant for us to main­tain this so­lid­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ster­ling had not scored in the league for nearly two months and had been left out by Guardi­ola in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>But he looked more like his old self, get­ting in be­hind Ful­ham’s de­fence to pro­vide some much­needed pen­e­tra­tion for a City side who have strug­gled to score goals this sea­son, with 10 strikes in their first eight league games.</p>
    <p>Fel­low Eng­land in­ter­na­tional John Stones, who in the sum­mer was tipped to leave the Eti­had af­ter los­ing his place last term, has also re­gained Guardi­ola’s favour, start­ing his sec­ond league game in a row ahead of Aymeric La­porte in de­fence.</p>
    <p>“We need to keep this streak go­ing, keep these clean sheets go­ing too,” said the cen­tre-back.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery game we play in, we could al­ways score more. I’m sure the strik­ers will be frus­trated but it’s just good to get the three points.”</p>
