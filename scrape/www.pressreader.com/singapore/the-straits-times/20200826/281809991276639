    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The head of the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) walked back his claim that an ex­per­i­men­tal ther­apy had pro­vided a dra­matic ben­e­fit to Covid-19 pa­tients, a rare re­ver­sal for an agency that has prided it­self on rock-solid sci­ence and public trust.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day night at a press con­fer­ence with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, FDA Com­mis­sioner Stephen Hahn said that blood plasma from Covid-19 sur­vivors given to new pa­tients could save huge num­bers of lives.</p>
    <p>“What that means is – and if the data con­tin­ues to pan out – 100 peo­ple who are sick with Covid-19, 35 would have been saved be­cause of the ad­min­is­tra­tion of plasma,” Mr Hahn said.</p>
    <p>The FDA chief’s re­marks fol­lowed sim­i­lar com­ments by Mr</p>
    <p>Trump – who said the ther­apy is “proven to re­duce mor­tal­ity by 35 per cent” – and by Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar.</p>
    <p>On Monday night, Mr Hahn re­versed him­self.</p>
    <p>“I have been crit­i­cised for re­marks I made Sun­day night about the ben­e­fits of con­va­les­cent plasma. The crit­i­cism is en­tirely jus­ti­fied,” Mr Hahn said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>He had spent much of Monday tak­ing heat from health ex­perts, in­clud­ing two for­mer FDA com­mis­sion­ers, for his re­marks.</p>
    <p>“That was not the way that I would have worded it,” said one of the doc­tors who led the blood plasma study, Pro­fes­sor Ar­turo Casade­vall, chair of the depart­ment of molec­u­lar mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy and im­munol­ogy at the Johns Hop­kins School of Public Health. “I hope they will is­sue a clar­i­fi­ca­tion,” Prof Casade­vall said ear­lier on Monday.</p>
    <p>What the data does show is that a higher dose of blood plasma is bet­ter than a lower one. And while there are promis­ing sig­nals that it will lead to a real ben­e­fit when com­pared with a placebo, that is not known yet.</p>
    <p>“Un­til we have a ran­domised con­trolled trial, we don’t know defini­tively,” Prof Casade­vall said.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion’s mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the data may raise fears about how Mr Hahn and the rest of the ad­min­is­tra­tion will treat data on a vac­cine for the virus.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has said he ex­pects one to be ready in time for his po­ten­tial re-elec­tion, and on Saturday ac­cused unnamed mem­bers of the “deep state” at the FDA of slow­ing work to hurt him po­lit­i­cally.</p>
    <p>“Deep state” is a term used by Mr Trump to de­scribe em­ploy­ees of gov­ern­ment agen­cies that he be­lieves are ma­nip­u­lat­ing pol­icy to work against his in­ter­ests. There is no ev­i­dence this is hap­pen­ing at the FDA.</p>
    <p>The “35 per cent” statis­tic has sev­eral fa­tal flaws. Since every­one in the pro­gramme re­ceived blood plasma, it is not known what would have hap­pened com­pared with pa­tients who did not get the ther­apy.</p>
    <p>And scores of vari­ables, like how sick the pa­tients were and when they were treated – could have skewed the re­sults.</p>
    <p>Mr Robert Califf, the FDA com­mis­sioner un­der the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, said he thought Mr Hahn had mis­spo­ken. “It would be good for Steve to pub­lish a cor­rec­tion,” Mr Califf said on Twit­ter on Monday.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors and pa­tients rely on the FDA to put out au­thor­i­ta­tive in­for­ma­tion about the safety and ef­fi­cacy of drugs, vac­cines, med­i­cal de­vices and other prod­ucts, guid­ing their use not just in the United States but around the world.</p>
    <p>The agency has his­tor­i­cally care­fully guarded its rep­u­ta­tion and sci­en­tific in­de­pen­dence. How­ever, Mr Hahn’s com­ments about 35 out of 100 peo­ple be­ing saved were still posted to the FDA’s of­fi­cial Twit­ter ac­count as of Monday af­ter­noon.</p>
