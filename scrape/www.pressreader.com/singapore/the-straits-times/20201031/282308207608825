    <p>And then, as ev­ery­one has been hop­ing for, comes phase three.</p>
    <p>Yes, per­haps com­ing soon to a cin­ema, res­tau­rant or sports hall near you, is the third phase of Sin­ga­pore’s slowly-but-surely re­open­ing of its econ­omy, with new busi­ness and leisure ac­tiv­i­ties re-emerg­ing.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing en­dured months of re­stric­tions, so­cially and eco­nom­i­cally, it is lit­tle won­der that this has been anx­iously an­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>Painful as they were, the mea­sures worked in flat­ten­ing the in­fec­tion curve, beat­ing the coro­n­avirus back to low or zero lev­els in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>In ef­fect, we are now back to roughly where we were in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber those hal­cyon days, which seem an age ago, when most of us still made the daily trip into the of­fice, ven­tured out pretty much as we pleased, trav­el­ling and con­sum­ing air­plane food in the air, or even en­joy­ing cruises that were not just sail­ing to nowhere.</p>
    <p>Then, as now, the virus out­break at home seemed largely un­der con­trol, even as it was flar­ing up abroad.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing paid the high price of the cir­cuit breaker to check the virus, minds have now rightly turned to how best to jump-start the econ­omy, with­out al­low­ing the virus to surge again.</p>
    <p>This will re­quire a mea­sure of Goldilocks not-too-hot and not-too-cold bal­anc­ing to get things right.</p>
    <p>Move too fast, whether out of fa­tigue and frus­tra­tion, giv­ing in to po­lit­i­cal pres­sures or com­mer­cial im­per­a­tives, and the virus will be back with a vengeance.</p>
    <p>Should that hap­pen, the sea­sonal block­buster com­ing to a cin­ema near you will be Cir­cuit Breaker II, a se­quel, I sus­pect, that few will be in a hurry to catch.</p>
    <p>Yet, move too slowly, and Sin­ga­pore’s hard-earned po­si­tion as a re­gional and global hub, where the world comes to con­nect and trade, risks be­ing snatched by oth­ers only too ea­ger to dis­place it from its cov­eted perch.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, there is added ur­gency to get­ting the econ­omy go­ing. Af­ter all, push, it would seem, has come to shove.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ments, held off for months, look set to rise, as govern­ment sup­port grants taper off. Wage cuts loom, now that the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil has sanc­tioned such a re­course if all else fails to stave off job cuts.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther afield, there is talk of a long, dark win­ter ahead, as the virus surges in Europe and the United States, with case num­bers and deaths hit­ting new highs. New lock­downs in France, Ger­many and else­where por­tend a dou­ble-dip re­ces­sion in some coun­tries.</p>
    <p>LONG AND SHORT OF COVID-19</p>
    <p>In the light of this, the talk among the ex­perts has turned to what is be­ing called “long Covid”.</p>
    <p>Put sim­ply, this means that the pan­demic, which some had ini­tially said, rather hope­fully, would pass in weeks or months, now looks like it is here to stay well into the new year, and alas, per­haps even be­yond.</p>
    <p>For even if a vi­able vac­cine is found any time soon, it will take many more months to scale up pro­duc­tion and ship it widely be­fore it can do its heal­ing magic. Restor­ing eco­nomic con­fi­dence and so­cial well-be­ing might take longer.</p>
    <p>It is against this gloomy back­drop that Sin­ga­pore­ans, iron­i­cally, are look­ing for­ward to the sunny prospect of a re­open­ing ahead.</p>
    <p>Who can blame us, given where we have been?</p>
    <p>In­deed, given the ex­pe­ri­ence of the past months, we should count our­selves lucky.</p>
    <p>Our hos­pi­tals have not been over­whelmed. In­ten­sive care units here are rel­a­tively quiet. Ven­ti­la­tors, once fren­ziedly sought, are stashed away. Com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties, ramped up at speed, have been al­lowed to stand down.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, the death toll here – at 28 – is re­mark­ably, and thank­fully, low by most ob­jec­tive standards.</p>
    <p>We lose sight of th­ese achieve­ments at our peril.</p>
    <p>For do­ing so opens up a void, which can too eas­ily be filled by restive­ness or even re­sent­ment, as seen in so many parts of the world.</p>
    <p>PAST IS PRO­LOGUE</p>
    <p>In this re­gard, what’s past is pro­logue, as Wil­liam Shake­speare fa­mously says in one of his plays.</p>
    <p>For the dif­fi­cult chal­lenge for us now is how to grad­u­ally get back to where we were, re­sum­ing eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties, step by cau­tious step, only too aware that we must give no quar­ter which a nasty, crafty bug stands ever ready to seize on.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence of the past months has taught us that this coro­n­avirus does not take a sum­mer hol­i­day, as Euro­pean coun­tries have learnt the hard way.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, it will not hold off just be­cause Sin­ga­pore­ans want – no, need! – a break or have to go on hol­i­day dur­ing the up­com­ing De­cem­ber va­ca­tion sea­son.</p>
    <p>Covid-19, it should be clear by now, re­spects nei­ther rank nor rep­u­ta­tion, strik­ing pres­i­dents and pau­pers alike.</p>
    <p>It cares not for po­lit­i­cal rhetoric or wish­ful think­ing about how it will soon pass or be brought un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus’ mes­sage to us hu­mans has all along been clear and sim­ple: We just want to repli­cate! Just give us half a chance to do so, and we will.</p>
    <p>So, even while we might all be chaf­ing at the bit, and want des­per­ately to go rush­ing ahead with phase three, we will have to brace our­selves for many more months of cau­tious grad­u­al­ism – feel­ing our way for­ward, di­alling things up and down to re­set our world as we knew it, and re­act­ing to the in­evitable ebbs and flows that are still to come.</p>
    <p>A BIT OF A GRIND</p>
    <p>In­deed, like it or not, as Cana­dian au­thor Emily St John Mandel put it in a re­cent in­ter­view with the Fi­nan­cial Times (FT), the months to come could be “a bit of a te­dious grind”.</p>
    <p>The au­thor of Sta­tion Eleven, a 2014 novel about a fic­tional pan­demic that hits the world, points to the pre­scient blog in March by Mr Tomas Pueyo, ti­tled The Ham­mer And The Dance.</p>
    <p>That de­scribed the process of so­ci­eties be­gin­ning to “dance”, as the virus num­bers fall, open­ing up one thing at a time, with ham­mer in hand ready to bat­ter the bug down should virus num­bers jump again.</p>
    <p>And, to com­pli­cate mat­ters fur­ther, even as we learn to live with the bug in this new nor­mal in the short term, we will have to keep an eye on how to make the best of a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion in the medium term, while also try­ing to min­imise the long-term scar­ring of our so­ci­ety and econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This will be a tricky trilemma, with dif­fi­cult judg­ment calls hav­ing to be made, with­out quite know­ing what the fu­ture might en­tail, and per­haps the only cer­tainty be­ing that it is un­likely to be just a re­gres­sion to the past.</p>
    <p>To see this more clearly, con­sider how we might choose to work once the pan­demic has passed. A re­cent sur­vey by The Straits Times and OPPi, an opin­ion re­search firm, showed that eight in 10 of those polled pre­ferred to con­tinue work­ing form home, or some sort of flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Only one in 10 said they yearned to go back to their of­fices, with the other one in 10 hav­ing done so al­ready.</p>
    <p>In other words, em­ploy­ers must gird them­selves for some dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions with staff who might well ask why they must re­turn to the old ways of work­ing, when the months of telecom­mut­ing they have en­dured – and some rather en­joyed – proved so ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Yet, while work­ing from home has many up­sides, it comes with costs too. We are all so­cial an­i­mals, and most would ac­cept that some­thing vi­tal is lost from our en­forced so­cial sep­a­ra­tion, in terms of our abil­ity to col­lab­o­rate, foster bonds, build cul­tures, train and men­tor, to hone the skills and in­stincts that will be needed for suc­cess in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the so­ci­etal ten­dency to re­vert to the fa­mil­iar, cou­pled with pres­sures to do as oth­ers are do­ing, could also drive a re­ver­sal to deep-seated busi­ness norms.</p>
    <p>A re­cent thought­ful FT re­port on the fu­ture of work summed it up well when it ar­gued that it would be “un­wise to com­mit to per­ma­nent plans about work pat­terns on cur­rent cir­cum­stances”.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the choices made now about whether to work from home are not real ones, given that the virus con­tin­ues to rage in many places.</p>
    <p>“This isn’t gen­uine re­mote work­ing in that it has re­moved au­ton­omy of choos­ing when to work from home ver­sus when to work in the of­fice – au­ton­omy be­ing a key suc­cess fac­tor to re­mote work­ing.”</p>
    <p>So even here too, we look to be in for a bit of a te­dious grind, plod­ding un­cer­tainly along, try­ing things out to see what works, ad­just­ing and adapt­ing, as the sit­u­a­tion un­folds, for many more months to come.</p>
    <p>“To­mor­row, and to­mor­row, and to­mor­row, creeps in this petty pace from day to day,” as Mac­beth lamented in the epony­mous play.</p>
    <p>ANGST AND FA­TIGUE</p>
    <p>I know, it all sounds fright­fully try­ing and tire­some, enough to in­duce a wave of what the ex­perts call “pan­demic fa­tigue” – that sense of rest­less­ness and re­sent­ment that is fu­elling so much angst, both here and around the world.</p>
    <p>The French, as so of­ten, have a word that sums the mood up well – en­nui – re­fer­ring to the bore­dom and men­tal ex­haus­tion that come from not hav­ing much that is in­ter­est­ing or ex­cit­ing to do.</p>
    <p>Sound fa­mil­iar?</p>
    <p>Nowhere to go th­ese De­cem­ber hol­i­days. Scaled-down Christ­mas dec­o­ra­tions in Or­chard Road. Par­ties re­stricted to five (or mer­ci­fully, by then, eight?). Gifts or­dered on­line, de­liv­ered in dull brown boxes.</p>
    <p>Rightly, many are now say­ing that we ought to pay closer at­ten­tion to the deeper scar­ring that might be wrought by “long Covid”.</p>
    <p>This might re­sem­ble the men­tal trau­mas that arose from en­dur­ing years of wars, de­pres­sions or oc­cu­pa­tions.</p>
    <p>For the dif­fi­cult chal­lenge for us now is how to grad­u­ally get back to where we were, re­sum­ing eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties, step by cau­tious step, only too aware that we must give no quar­ter which a nasty, crafty bug stands ever ready to seize on... Covid-19, it should be clear by now, re­spects nei­ther rank nor rep­u­ta­tion, strik­ing pres­i­dents and pau­pers alike.</p>
    <p>TRY­ING TIMES</p>
    <p>The ques­tions we must con­sider then are th­ese: How to cope in th­ese try­ing times? How to stay sane, and still, when our in­stincts are to rush ahead to re­gain our lives, just at a time when we have to ex­er­cise re­straint, or risk what we have gained?</p>
    <p>How to do so when the usual an­ti­dotes to the stress and strain of our hyper-ur­ban lives – the an­nual getaway, the fren­zied shop­ping, the dizzy­ing lights, and par­ties with friends and fam­ily to add some cheer – all seem im­pos­si­ble or ill-ad­vised?</p>
    <p>There are no easy an­swers, and at the risk of sound­ing flip­pant or facile, I would sim­ply say: Be.</p>
    <p>Take heart from the an­cient Zen wis­dom in deal­ing with the in­eluctable vi­cis­si­tudes of life, al­ways ebbing and flow­ing, ever chang­ing, even as things stay pretty much the same.</p>
    <p>Be kinder. To your­self, and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Pause. Pon­der. Pe­ruse.</p>
    <p>You are, af­ter all, go­ing nowhere, and time, for once, is not so scarce.</p>
    <p>You might also turn, as I of­ten do, to the Bard for so­lace and suc­cour.</p>
    <p>In his play, Henry VI, th­ese words are of­fered to the weary:</p>
    <p>“Wise men ne’er sit and wail their loss</p>
    <p>But cheerly seek how to re­dress their harms.</p>
    <p>What though the mast be now blown over­board,</p>
    <p>The ca­ble broke, the hold­ing-an­chor lost,</p>
    <p>And half our sailors swal­lowed in the flood?</p>
    <p>Yet lives our pi­lot still. Is’t meet that he</p>
    <p>Should leave the helm and, like a fear­ful lad,</p>
    <p>With tear­ful eyes add wa­ter to the sea,</p>
    <p>And give more strength to that which hath too much,</p>
    <p>Whiles, in his moan the ship splits on the rock,</p>
    <p>Which in­dus­try and courage might have saved?...</p>
    <p>Why, courage then! what can­not be avoided</p>
    <p>‘Twere child­ish weak­ness to lament or fear.”</p>
