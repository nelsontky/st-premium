    <p>Mr Ron Ng Yong Kiang’s Fo­rum let­ter echoes the hol­low words dis­sem­i­nated world­wide on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia plat­forms to jus­tify China’s il­le­gal recla­ma­tion and mil­i­tari­sa­tion of is­lands in the South China Sea (Is China the threat or the threat­ened?, Oct 20).</p>
    <p>It seems to sug­gest that “con­text” alone can ex­plain away China’s bla­tant sub­ver­sion of in­ter­na­tional law in this re­gard. Or that mil­i­tary or fi­nan­cial might is right be­cause China has more re­sources than its poorer neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Whether China was the first or last to re­claim is­lands or mil­i­tarise those in the area is ir­rel­e­vant for the sim­ple rea­son that all the other claimants have em­barked on land recla­ma­tion ac­tiv­i­ties for mil­i­tary and other pur­poses “legally” within their re­spec­tive ju­ris­dic­tions ac­cord­ing to in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>Un­like its fel­low claimants, China also stands out for caus­ing ir­repara­ble dam­age to the mar­itime en­vi­ron­ment via its bru­tal an­nex­a­tion of ter­ri­tory in the area.</p>
    <p>Above all, China was given the op­por­tu­nity to de­fend its claims against the Philip­pines in the Per­ma­nent Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion (PCA), but chose to snub it, and lost. While it has ex­pressed con­tempt for the PCA’s 2016 rul­ing, it has also re­port­edly sought a deal with Manila to drop the ver­dict in ex­change for more “in­vest­ments”. This ma­noeu­vre to “buy up” a neigh­bour’s sovereignt­y is as out­ra­geous as Mr Ng’s ob­jec­tion to the US Navy’s law­ful free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion ex­er­cises close to “un­law­ful” Chi­nese po­si­tions in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Any civilised na­tion that feels threat­ened by others, or its own de­mons, would look to se­cure it­self from within its ter­ri­tory first and fore­most, among other le­gal mea­sures, in­stead of an­nex­ing the global com­mons.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, has Bei­jing con­sid­ered Hainan Is­land to ex­pand its mil­i­tary de­fence to the hilt? Or Hong Kong Is­land for that mat­ter now that it has im­posed the na­tional se­cu­rity law on the spe­cial ad­min­is­tra­tive re­gion? How about Cam­bo­dia as a pearl on its strate­gic string of de­fence, ac­cord­ing to var­i­ous reports?</p>
    <p>Sad to say, the China that re­peat­edly trum­pets its inevitable “peace­ful” rise to all and sundry is now em­broiled in more ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes than any other coun­try.</p>
