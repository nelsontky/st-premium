    <p>More than 40,000 fam­i­lies in 32 pri­mary schools will be tak­ing part in Back to School with Dad next Mon­day and Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive, which en­cour­ages fa­thers to ac­com­pany their chil­dren to school on the first two days, is or­gan­ised by the Cen­tre for Father­ing and na­tional move­ment Dads for Life.</p>
    <p>Since 2006, the Cen­tre for Father­ing has been en­cour­ag­ing fa­thers to take time off work in the first two days of the school year to ease their chil­dren into a new class.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion and So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Sun Xuel­ing high­lighted the cru­cial roles both par­ents play in a child’s up­bring­ing and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“Typ­i­cally, we tend to see mothers be­ing more in­volved in this process. But fa­thers are im­por­tant too, and should part­ner their spouses more con­cretely in this en­deav­our. Back to School with Dad is there­fore an ex­cel­lent ini­tia­tive, and I en­cour­age all our schools to em­brace it to en­cour­age fa­ther­child bond­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun added that while the ini­tia­tive fo­cuses on the first two days of the school year, she hoped it would serve as a cat­a­lyst for more sus­tained ef­forts.</p>
    <p>A Back to School with Dad card has also been de­signed for fa­thers to write a note of en­cour­age­ment to their chil­dren, a sur­prise for stu­dents to find in their lunch­box dur­ing re­cess.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cen­tre for Father­ing and Dads for Life Bryan Tan said: “We hope that many more schools will ap­pre­ci­ate the im­por­tance of a father’s in­volve­ment in his child’s school­ing jour­ney and pledge their sup­port to­wards the Back to School with Dad ini­tia­tive.”</p>
    <p>Shar­ing his own ex­pe­ri­ence, Mr Tan said: “When I send my chil­dren to school, I’ve no­ticed that they would al­ways look back at the school gate to see if I am still there be­fore they en­ter the school. This made me re­alise that my pres­ence re­as­sures them that Daddy will al­ways be there, watch­ing their backs.”</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion on the ini­tia­tive, as well as a print­able copy of the de­signed card, is avail­able at https://fa­thers.com.sg/back-toschool-with-dad/</p>
    <p>Since 2006, the Cen­tre for Father­ing has been en­cour­ag­ing fa­thers to take time off work in the first two days of the school year to ease their chil­dren into a new class.</p>
