    <p>MEL­BOURNE When the Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties an­nounced the first ar­rest un­der the coun­try’s new for­eign in­ter­fer­ence laws last week, they said lit­tle about what the sus­pect was ac­cused of do­ing, and noth­ing at all about the coun­try on whose be­half he was be­lieved to have worked.</p>
    <p>The im­pli­ca­tion, though, was clear. The man is a prom­i­nent mem­ber of the Chi­nese Aus­tralian com­mu­nity who has been in­volved with one of the coun­try’s ma­jor po­lit­i­cal par­ties. And he was charged un­der sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion, passed in 2018, that is widely seen as tar­get­ing China and that Beijing has called an in­sult.</p>
    <p>The ar­rest of Di Sanh Duong, known as Sunny, fol­lows a break­down in the China-Aus­tralia re­la­tion­ship, which in re­cent weeks has been marred by signs that Beijing is crimp­ing pur­chases of an ar­ray of goods from Aus­tralia’s ex­port-de­pen­dent econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions have sim­mered for years as Aus­tralia has com­plained of med­dling by China in its pol­i­tics, uni­ver­si­ties and me­dia.</p>
    <p>But given Aus­tralia’s ini­tial re­straint in de­scrib­ing the case against Duong, it was un­clear whether the ar­rest would ag­gra­vate the strains even fur­ther.</p>
    <p>“China was very con­cerned about the pass­ing of the leg­is­la­tion be­cause the rhetoric at the time was very tar­geted at China,” said Ms Yun Jiang, ed­i­tor of the China Story blog at the Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity and di­rec­tor of the China Pol­icy Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“In this in­stance, they haven’t even named the coun­try yet – so right now we don’t have that tough rhetoric on China,” she added. But if Aus­tralia says more about the case and pub­licly ties it to Beijing, “China may re­act more strongly”, Ms Jiang said.</p>
    <p>Duong, 65, was charged in Mel­bourne last Thurs­day with “pre­par­ing for a for­eign in­ter­fer­ence of­fence” and was granted bail. He faces up to 10 years in prison if con­victed. Duong is of Viet­namese Chi­nese her­itage and has served on the boards of a num­ber of Chi­nese Aus­tralian com­mu­nity groups.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral po­lice said in a state­ment that Duong’s ar­rest had come after a year-long in­ves­ti­ga­tion. A per­son with in­sider knowl­edge said po­lice were in­ves­ti­gat­ing whether Duong had sought to in­flu­ence act­ing fed­eral im­mi­gra­tion min­is­ter Alan Tudge, and whether the con­duct was on be­half of or in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>In June, Mr Tudge ap­peared with Duong at an event at which Duong pre­sented a do­na­tion to a Mel­bourne hospi­tal on be­half of a com­mu­nity as­so­ci­a­tion he leads, the Ocea­nia Fed­er­a­tion of Chi­nese Or­gan­i­sa­tions From Viet­nam, Cam­bo­dia and Laos. Mr Tudge has not been ac­cused of any wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Jiang said the case against Duong was sig­nif­i­cant be­cause it would be the first time that the gov­ern­ment had pro­vided ex­am­ples of what con­sti­tuted for­eign in­ter­fer­ence un­der the new laws.</p>
    <p>Still, she said, it re­mained un­clear ex­actly what that would be, based on the lim­ited in­for­ma­tion about the case. She said membership in a com­mu­nity group in it­self was not enough to prove that Duong had en­gaged in il­le­gal ac­tiv­ity and that the group was still le­gal in Aus­tralia.</p>
