    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) will con­sider al­low­ing the con­sump­tion of al­co­hol in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries as the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in dorms sta­bilises, but in the mean­time will step up checks to pre­vent al­co­hol and cig­a­rettes be­ing smug­gled in.</p>
    <p>The min­istry was re­spond­ing to me­dia queries af­ter a 74-sec­ond video clip, taken on Tues­day at Tuas View Dor­mi­tory, sur­faced on­line show­ing three Cer­tis aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cers pour­ing con­fis­cated al­co­hol into a drain.</p>
    <p>Cer­tis has said that the three of­fi­cers acted in­ap­pro­pri­ately, adding that they were coun­selled and re­de­ployed to other du­ties.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to me­dia queries, Cer­tis said its in­ves­ti­ga­tions found the of­fi­cers had helped with the dis­posal of the al­co­hol fol­low­ing a re­quest from the dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>“We have also re­it­er­ated to all of­fi­cers de­ployed for Covid-19 op­er­a­tions at the dor­mi­to­ries to re­main fo­cused on their pri­mary role in main­tain­ing or­der and safety of the res­i­dents in the dor­mi­to­ries. All pro­hib­ited items would be handed over to the dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors,” Cer­tis said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Cer­tis will fully co­op­er­ate and as­sist with the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties for any fol­low-up ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>MOM said yes­ter­day that it, along with the po­lice, was aware of cases where unau­tho­rised al­co­hol and cig­a­rettes had made their way into dorms over the past few months.</p>
    <p>“These ac­tiv­i­ties were put to a stop promptly and stern ac­tions have been taken against the res­i­dents in­volved, in­clud­ing im­po­si­tion of ad­min­is­tra­tive penal­ties by the dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors,” it said.</p>
    <p>MOM noted that be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, dorm res­i­dents were al­lowed to con­sume al­co­hol and smoke in des­ig­nated ar­eas within the build­ings, but were pro­hib­ited from drink­ing in their rooms.</p>
    <p>The sale and con­sump­tion of al­co­hol have been sus­pended with the pan­demic to avoid any po­ten­tial</p>
    <p>“law and or­der is­sues”, said MOM.</p>
    <p>“As the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises in the dor­mi­to­ries, MOM, in con­sul­ta­tion with the dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors, will con­sider grad­u­ally re­lax­ing the rules and al­low mod­er­ate con­sump­tion of al­co­hol within the dor­mi­tory premises,” it added.</p>
    <p>“In the mean­time, the au­thor­i­ties will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion closely and work with the dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors to im­ple­ment mea­sures to pre­vent re­cur­rence (of smug­gling ac­tiv­i­ties), in­clud­ing step­ping up checks of per­sons and ve­hi­cles en­ter­ing the dor­mi­to­ries.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, The New Paper re­ported that smug­gled al­co­hol and cig­a­rettes were be­ing sold at marked-up prices – up to four times their usual – in cer­tain dorms.</p>
    <p>But dorm op­er­a­tors in­ter­viewed said the prob­lem was not wide­spread.</p>
    <p>Cen­tu­rion Cor­po­ra­tion, which op­er­ates five dorms, said there were nine cases from May to this month of res­i­dents try­ing to bring al­co­hol or cig­a­rettes into dorms over fences.</p>
    <p>“These were small quan­ti­ties for per­sonal con­sump­tion, and there is no ev­i­dence to sug­gest they were in­tended for wider sales to other res­i­dents,” said its spokesman.</p>
    <p>He noted that the items were legally pur­chased, so while smug­gling them might have con­tra­vened dor­mi­tory house rules, the res­i­dents did not break the law. In such cases, the items are con­fis­cated and de­stroyed, the of­fender is fined be­tween $50 and $100, and the em­ployer is in­formed.</p>
    <p>Mr Jack Ng, who man­ages the 1,270-bed Hulett Dor­mi­tory, said there have been only two cases of smug­gling in his dorm since April.</p>
    <p>Site su­per­vi­sor and dorm res­i­dent Kan­dan Gopinath, 41, used to drink al­co­hol about twice a week, es­pe­cially at night af­ter a long day’s work.</p>
    <p>He said he un­der­stood that safe dis­tanc­ing is­sues could arise if groups are al­lowed to gather to drink al­co­hol in the dorms. “Maybe one way is to limit drink­ing to one or two cans (of beer), or to a few hours on week­ends,” he added.</p>
