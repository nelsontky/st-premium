    <p>LON­DON • Tot­ten­ham may be fly­ing high in all com­pe­ti­tions but man­ager Jose Mour­inho has con­ceded that he is un­able to keep all of his play­ers happy.</p>
    <p>Spurs, who had al­ready pro­gressed to the last 32 of the Europa League, beat An­twerp 2-0 af­ter strikes by Car­los Vini­cius and Gio­vani lo Celso. They also sealed top spot in Group J on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dele Alli failed to get off the bench, while fel­low Eng­land mid­fielder Harry Winks walked straight down the tun­nel when he came off for Tan­guy Ndombele in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>“How can I keep them all happy? I don’t think they’re all happy at all, that’s the na­ture of foot­ball. I can­not make mir­a­cles,” Mour­inho told BT Sport. “I told the play­ers if they’re not subbed on, just go for a hot shower.</p>
    <p>“I told ev­ery player that left the pitch to go be­cause when the weather is cold, I pre­fer they go to the dress­ing room and have a shower.</p>
    <p>“Winks de­cided to go and I am happy with that be­cause I am the one that told him to do it.”</p>
    <p>Spurs head into to­mor­row’s Premier League clash at Crys­tal Palace on top of the stand­ings and have not lost since the open­ing day of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Alli has been a pe­riph­eral player, mak­ing just two ap­pear­ances, in­clud­ing one start, in the league. Winks fared slightly bet­ter with three league starts, and both looked vis­i­bly frus­trated.</p>
    <p>“Let’s not run away from re­al­ity. A player on the bench who re­alises all five subs have been used of course is not a happy player and I would not ex­pect him to be happy,” Mour­inho said of Alli.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Group B win­ners Arse­nal main­tained their 100 per cent record as goals from Ed­die Nke­tiah, Mo­hamed El­neny, Joe Wil­lock and sub­sti­tute Fo­larin Ba­lo­gun sealed a 4-2 win at Dun­dalk.</p>
    <p>The last-32 draw will be made on Mon­day.</p>
