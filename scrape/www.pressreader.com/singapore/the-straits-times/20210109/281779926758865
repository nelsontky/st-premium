    <p>• China has sealed off two cities south of Bei­jing, cut­ting trans­port links and ban­ning mil­lions of res­i­dents from leav­ing, as the au­thor­i­ties move to stem the coun­try’s largest Covid-19 out­break in six months.</p>
    <p>The out­break in China has so far been broadly brought to heel by the au­thor­i­ties since its emer­gence in Wuhan in late 2019, with small out­breaks swiftly snuffed out us­ing mass test­ing, lo­cal lock­downs and travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>But in the past week, He­bei prov­ince in north­ern China has re­ported 127 new Covid-19 cases, plus an ad­di­tional 183 asymp­to­matic in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity were found in Shi­ji­azhuang, a city of sev­eral mil­lion in He­bei whose sur­round­ing ar­eas take the to­tal pop­u­la­tion to 11 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Nine con­firmed cases were re­ported in the neigh­bour­ing city of Xing­tai, whose area cov­ers seven mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of both cities are banned from leav­ing their homes un­less ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary, He­bei of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They vowed to “strictly con­trol the move­ment of peo­ple and ve­hi­cles”, with all res­i­den­tial es­tates placed un­der “closed man­age­ment” or lock­down.</p>
    <p>He­bei res­i­dents are also banned from en­ter­ing Bei­jing or leav­ing the prov­ince un­less ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>“The out­break was i mported from abroad, but the exact ori­gins are cur­rently un­der in-depth in­ves­ti­ga­tion by state, provin­cial and mu­nic­i­pal ex­perts,” said Mr Li Qi, head of the He­bei Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion, at a press brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese of­fi­cials have re­peat­edly tried to link re­cur­rent do­mes­tic out­breaks to strains of the virus cir­cu­lat­ing over­seas, sug­gest­ing that it has been brought back into China by re­turn­ing trav­ellers and con­tam­i­nated pack­ag­ing of im­ported food prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>There are ris­ing fears that travel plans for hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple dur­ing next month’s Chi­nese New Year may be ru­ined as virus con­trols tighten.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials are start­ing to sig­nal a low-key new year hol­i­day – which will run from Feb 11 to 17 – nix­ing the prospect of ban­quets, par­ties and public cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>“Mass cel­e­bra­tions, gath­er­ings and fairs are for­bid­den,” said Mr Kang Sen of Bei­jing’s agri­cul­ture and ru­ral af­fairs au­thor­ity. He added that even fu­ner­als should be “brief” and all public events would need prior ap­proval.</p>
