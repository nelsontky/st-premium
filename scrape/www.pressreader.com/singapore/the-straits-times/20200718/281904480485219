    <p>• Ac­cus­ing Amer­i­can firms of en­gag­ing in “cor­po­rate ap­pease­ment” of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP), US At­tor­ney­Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr has called on the pri­vate sec­tor to get tougher in re­sist­ing what he por­trayed as cor­rupt­ing ef­forts by China to cheat and bully its way into tak­ing over the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The CCP has launched an or­ches­trated cam­paign across all of its many tentacles in Chi­nese gov­ern­ment and so­ci­ety to ex­ploit the open­ness of our in­sti­tu­tions in or­der to de­stroy them,” Mr Barr said in a speech at the Ger­ald R. Ford Pres­i­den­tial Mu­seum i n Grand Rapids, Michi­gan, on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“To se­cure a world of free­dom and pros­per­ity for our chil­dren and our grand­chil­dren, the free world will need its own ver­sion of a whole-of­so­ci­ety ap­proach in which the public and pri­vate sec­tors main­tain their sep­a­ra­tion but work together col­lab­o­ra­tively in or­der to re­sist dom­i­na­tion and to win the con­test for the com­mand­ing heights of the global econ­omy,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr’s was the third of four speeches on China by se­nior Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials, and it came as the White House was weigh­ing im­pos­ing a sweep­ing ban on travel to the United States by mem­bers of the CCP as part of a broader con­fronta­tion with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo is ex­pected to de­liver a speech on China next week.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr de­nounced China as an au­thor­i­tar­ian state that found will­ing “pawns” as it sought to in­fil­trate, cen­sor and co-opt Amer­i­can pri­vate sec­tor in­sti­tu­tions and steal tech­no­log­i­cal know-how.</p>
    <p>He fo­cused in par­tic­u­lar on en­ter­tain­ment and high-tech busi­nesses, in­dus­tries that Repub­li­cans some­times view as too lib­eral po­lit­i­cally.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral crit­i­cised ac­tors and di­rec­tors for lec­tur­ing the US at the Academy Awards each year about “how this coun­try falls short of Hol­ly­wood’s val­ues” even as their in­dus­try cen­sored movies to avoid los­ing ac­cess to the Chi­nese mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr cited Para­mount Pic­tures al­ter­ing a scene in the 2013 zom­bie apoc­a­lypse movie World War Z, in which the char­ac­ters had spec­u­lated that a virus out­break had started in China, as well as the de­ci­sion by the screen­writer of the 2016 movie Dr Strange, by Dis­ney’s Marvel Stu­dios, to change the eth­nic­ity of a ma­jor char­ac­ter who is Ti­betan in the comic books to Celtic to avoid an­ger­ing the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“Many more scripts never see the light of day be­cause writ­ers and pro­duc­ers know not to test the lim­its,” Mr Barr said. “Chi­nese gov­ern­ment cen­sors don’t need to say a word be­cause Hol­ly­wood is do­ing their work for them. This is a mas­sive pro­pa­ganda coup (for China).”</p>
    <p>He also lam­basted Sil­i­con Val­ley com­pa­nies, say­ing that Cisco had helped China build its mas­sive sys­tem for cen­sor­ing and surveillin­g the In­ter­net, and that “Google, Mi­crosoft, Ya­hoo and Ap­ple have shown them­selves to be all too will­ing to col­lab­o­rate” with China.</p>
    <p>He fo­cused on Ap­ple, slam­ming it for re­mov­ing Chi­nese users’ abil­ity to ac­cess pro-democ­racy songs and apps that pro­vide news and can evade In­ter­net cen­sor­ship; for agree­ing to put iCloud data of Chi­nese users on servers in China; and for se­cur­ing iPhones in a way that in­hibits the abil­ity of the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) to scru­ti­nise data on de­vices even with war­rants – while, he in­sin­u­ated, treat­ing the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>“Do you think when Ap­ple sells phones in China, that Ap­ple phones in China are im­per­vi­ous to pen­e­tra­tion by Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties? They wouldn’t be sold if they were im­per­vi­ous to Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties,” he said. “That’s the dou­ble stan­dard that has been emerg­ing among Amer­i­can tech com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>An Ap­ple spokesman pointed to pre­vi­ous state­ments that the com­pany had made about its need to com­ply with Chi­nese laws, say­ing it would pro­vide iCloud data in its pos­ses­sion about in­di­vid­ual users in re­sponse to le­gal re­quests but “never bulk data”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also said there is no way to weaken its se­cu­rity fea­tures for the US gov­ern­ment with­out en­dan­ger­ing all its users.</p>
    <p>“We sell the same iPhone ev­ery­where,” an Ap­ple state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“We don’t store cus­tomers’ pass­codes, and we don’t have the ca­pac­ity to un­lock pass­code-pro­tected de­vices. In data cen­tres, we de­ploy strong hard­ware and soft­ware se­cu­rity pro­tec­tions to keep in­for­ma­tion safe and to en­sure there are no back doors into our sys­tems. All of these prac­tices ap­ply equally to our op­er­a­tions in ev­ery coun­try in the world.”</p>
    <p>Mr Barr praised the re­cent de­ci­sion by sev­eral tech giants to sus­pend pro­vid­ing user data to Chi­nese law en­force­ment in re­sponse to its crack­down on pro­test­ers in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that China has threat­ened crim­i­nal sanc­tions in re­sponse, he urged the com­pa­nies to hold firm.</p>
    <p>But he also as­serted that Amer­i­can cor­po­rate lead­ers with eco­nomic in­ter­ests in China were be­ing pres­sured to carry out covert in­flu­ence cam­paigns, sug­gest­ing that they could face le­gal li­a­bil­ity if they lob­bied for poli­cies that the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment had di­rected them to sup­port with­out dis­clos­ing the un­der­ly­ing re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>“You should be alert to how you might be used – and how your ef­forts on be­half of a for­eign com­pany or gov­ern­ment could im­pli­cate the For­eign Agents Reg­is­tra­tion Act,” Mr Barr warned.</p>
    <p>The law re­quires Amer­i­cans who lobby the gov­ern­ment on be­half of for­eign pow­ers to reg­is­ter with the Jus­tice Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>On June 24, Mr Robert O’Brien, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser, gave a speech say­ing as­sump­tions that China would lib­er­alise as it de­vel­oped eco­nom­i­cally had proved wrong. He equated Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping to Soviet dic­ta­tor Josef Stalin.</p>
    <p>Last week, FBI direc­tor Christo­pher Wray por­trayed China as “the great­est long-term threat” to Amer­i­can eco­nomic and na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>He slammed China’s use of eco­nomic es­pi­onage and cy­ber at­tacks to steal Amer­i­can-de­vel­oped tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“We’ve now reached the point where the FBI is open­ing a new China-re­lated coun­ter­in­tel­li­gence case about ev­ery 10 hours,” he said. “Of the nearly 5,000 ac­tive FBI coun­ter­in­tel­li­gence cases cur­rently un­der way across the coun­try, al­most half are re­lated to China.”</p>
    <p>PRO­PA­GANDA COUP</p>
    <p>Many more scripts never see the light of day be­cause writ­ers and pro­duc­ers know not to test the lim­its. Chi­nese gov­ern­ment cen­sors don’t need to say a word be­cause Hol­ly­wood is do­ing their work for them. This is a mas­sive pro­pa­ganda ’’ coup (for China). AT­TOR­NEY-GEN­ERAL WIL­LIAM BARR, tak­ing a swipe at Hol­ly­wood.</p>
