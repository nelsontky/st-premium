    <p>In­done­sian De­fence Min­is­ter Prabowo Su­bianto and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Wei Fenghe have agreed in a meet­ing to re­solve any is­sues aris­ing from South China Sea through di­a­logue, a se­nior In­done­sian gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The t wo min­is­ters i n their Jakarta meet­ing on Tues­day also dis­cussed the pos­si­bil­ity of hold­ing joint mil­i­tary drills and per­son­nel train­ing, and in­vest­ments in In­done­sia’s food es­tate projects, the of­fi­cial told The Straits Times on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>Mr Prabowo and the vis­it­ing Chi­nese State Coun­cil­lor and De­fence Min­is­ter Wei dis­cussed bi­lat­eral is­sues in­clud­ing the joint ef­fort to fight the coro­n­avirus, to co­op­er­a­tion in the de­fence in­dus­try, said a press state­ment i ssued by Mr Prabowo’s of­fice late on Tues­day. The state­ment did not elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>Mr Wei vis­ited In­done­sia af­ter land­ing in Kuala Lumpur on Mon­day where he held sep­a­rate meet­ings with Malaysia’s Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin and De­fence Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaa­cob.</p>
    <p>The vis­its came as for­eign min­is­ters of the 10-mem­ber Asean bloc that in­cludes In­done­sia and Malaysia be­gan their an­nual re­gional con­sul­ta­tions yes­ter­day, with US-China fric­tion, in­clud­ing in the South China Sea, ex­pected to be on the agenda.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing is be­ing held by video link with Viet­nam as chair.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, China’s se­nior di­plo­mat, State Coun­cil­lor Wang Yi, said yes­ter­day that the United States is di­rectly in­ter­ven­ing in ter­ri­to­rial and mar­itime dis­putes in the South China Sea due to its own po­lit­i­cal needs, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>The US is be­com­ing the big­gest driver of mil­i­tari­sa­tion in the re­gion, Mr Wang said in a video con­fer­ence with for­eign min­is­ters at the Asean sum­mit.</p>
    <p>“Peace and sta­bil­ity is China’s great­est strate­gic in­ter­est in the South China Sea. It is also the com­mon strate­gic as­pi­ra­tion of China and Asean coun­tries,” Mr Wang said in a state­ment posted on the for­eign min­istry’s web­site, as quoted by Reuters.</p>
    <p>On In­done­sia-China ties, Jakarta of­fi­cials say that bi­lat­eral re­la­tions have been marked by mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial projects, such as the joint-ven­ture nickel in­dus­trial project in In­done­sia’s Cen­tral Su­lawesi prov­ince. But there have also been sev­eral tense mar­itime bor­der in­ci­dents be­tween the two coun­tries, which Jakarta and Bei­jing have man­aged.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has re­peat­edly em­pha­sised its sovereignt­y over an area north of the Natuna Is­lands, where it says it has seen en­croach­ments by Chi­nese and Viet­namese ves­sels over the years.</p>
    <p>Three years ago, a se­nior In­done­sian gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial un­veiled a map which iden­ti­fied the sec­tion of the South China Sea north of the Natuna Is­lands as the North Natuna Sea.</p>
    <p>Although the area lies in In­done­sia’s exclusive eco­nomic zone, it was pre­vi­ously left un­named and was taken to be part of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Mr Wei in his meet­ing with Mr Prabowo said China is will­ing to strengthen di­a­logue and con­sul­ta­tion with In­done­sia to jointly main­tain peace and sta­bil­ity in the South China Sea, Xin­hua news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>China claims most of the South China Sea as sov­er­eign ter­ri­tory, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philip­pines and Viet­nam also lay claim to parts of the area through which about US$3 tril­lion (S$4.1 tril­lion) of trade passes each year.</p>
