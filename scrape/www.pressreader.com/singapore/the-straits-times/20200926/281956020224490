    <p>• France opened an anti-ter­ror in­ves­ti­ga­tion af­ter two jour­nal­ists were stabbed in Paris yes­ter­day near the for­mer of­fices of the Char­lie Hebdo satir­i­cal mag­a­zine that was at­tacked by Is­lamist mil­i­tants in 2015.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex, who rushed to the scene, said the main at­tacker had been ar­rested. A sec­ond per­son was also in cus­tody.</p>
    <p>Mr Cas­tex said the two wounded peo­ple were jour­nal­ists hav­ing a smoke in the street near the build­ing, and that their lives were not in dan­ger.</p>
    <p>“This at­tack hap­pened in a sym­bolic place at the time when the trial (for) the ter­ri­ble at­tacks on Char­lie Hebdo took place,” he said.</p>
    <p>A wit­ness told Europe 1 ra­dio: “I was in my of­fice. I heard screams on the road. I looked out of the win­dow and saw a woman who was ly­ing on the floor and had taken a whack in the face from what was pos­si­bly a ma­chete.”</p>
    <p>An­other neigh­bour, who heard the at­tack, told Reuters there was a long, deathly shout from “a per­son who was scream­ing and scream­ing”.</p>
    <p>Europe 1 ra­dio quoted po­lice of­fi­cials as say­ing the main sus­pect, aged 18, was known to se­cu­rity ser­vices and was born in Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>The na­tional anti-ter­ror­ism pros­e­cu­tor’s of­fice said it was in­ves­ti­gat­ing the case.</p>
    <p>Four­teen peo­ple went on trial in Paris on Sept 2, ac­cused of be­ing ac­com­plices in the at­tack on the Char­lie Hebdo of­fices in Jan­uary 2015 that killed 12 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The court heard that they had sought to avenge the Prophet Mo­ham­mad, nearly a decade af­ter the weekly pub­lished car­toons mock­ing him.</p>
    <p>Po­lice moved Char­lie Hebdo’s head of hu­man re­sources from her home this week af­ter threats against her life.</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Mor­eira, a jour­nal­ist from Pre­miere Ligne me­dia pro­duc­tion com­pany, told BFM TV that two of his col­leagues had been wounded.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­body... with a meat cleaver who at­tacked them in front of our of­fices. It was chill­ing,” he said.</p>
