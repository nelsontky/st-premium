    <p>Three Or­chard Road malls were added yes­ter­day to the list of places vis­ited by coro­n­avirus pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The malls were Ion Or­chard, Lucky Plaza and Paragon, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>For Paragon, the visit recorded was to the Muji store in the mall.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at th­ese places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>It has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>There were 11 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,665. This is the low­est daily fig­ure for new pa­tients since Sept 18, when 11 new in­fec­tions were also re­ported.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new pa­tients in­cluded two im­ported cases com­pris­ing one work pass holder and one work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>They re­turned from In­dia and the Philip­pines on Sept 13.</p>
    <p>Both im­ported cases had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said MOH.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases for the sec­ond day in a row.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing nine of the 11 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Seven had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With eight cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,326 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 29 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 268 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive had died of other causes.</p>
