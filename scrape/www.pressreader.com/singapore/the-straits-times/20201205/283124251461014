    <p>A MANLY RE­SPONSE: Bri­tish singer Harry Styles, 26, has been hav­ing fun with naysay­ers af­ter don­ning a Gucci gown on the cover of Vogue’s De­cem­ber is­sue.</p>
    <p>Flouncy dress aside, he is the first solo male to make the cover of the fash­ion monthly.</p>
    <p>One vo­cal critic has been Can­dace Owens, 31, an Amer­i­can con­ser­va­tive com­men­ta­tor, po­lit­i­cal ac­tivist and au­thor, who tweeted on Nov 15 in re­sponse to the cover: “Bring back manly men.” She ex­pressed out­rage at “the steady fem­i­ni­sa­tion of our men” and added: “There is no so­ci­ety that can sur­vive without strong men.”</p>
    <p>In what ap­peared to be a tongue-in-cheek re­sponse, Styles, who has never been shy about his fash­ion choices, posted a photo on In­sta­gram on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>In it, he wears a frilly suit while saucily eat­ing a ba­nana, with the cap­tion: “Bring back manly men”.</p>
    <p>The photo, from the lat­est Va­ri­ety mag­a­zine shoot, has al­ready amassed 7.6 mil­lion likes in one day and gar­nered sup­port from celebri­ties and politi­cians.</p>
    <p>Owens, who had re­cently re­leased a book, Black­out: How Black Amer­ica Can Make Its Sec­ond Es­cape From The Demo­crat Plan­ta­tion, fired an­other salvo shortly af­ter Styles’ post. She tweeted on Thurs­day: “Men in ball gowns and lit­tle girl’s cloth­ing are lauded as icons. Hol­ly­wood is no longer about di­ver­sity, it’s about per­ver­sity.”</p>
    <p>In his in­ter­view in Va­ri­ety, Styles al­luded to his crit­ics: “To not wear be­cause it’s fe­males’ cloth­ing, you shut out a whole world of great clothes.”</p>
    <p>He added: “And I think what’s ex­cit­ing about right now is you can wear what you like. It doesn’t have to be X or Y. Those lines are be­com­ing more and more blurred.”</p>
