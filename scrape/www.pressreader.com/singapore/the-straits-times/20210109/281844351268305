    <p>•</p>
    <p>SEOUL North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ex­plored ways to re­new in­ter-Korean ties and vowed to ex­pand diplo­matic re­la­tions, state me­dia has said, as he hosted a rare party congress less than two weeks be­fore United States Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>The eighth congress of the rul­ing Work­ers’ Party came amid a pro­longed grid­lock in talks aimed at dis­man­tling North Korea’s nu­clear and mis­sile pro­grammes in re­turn for US sanc­tion re­lief.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the third day of the congress, Mr Kim raised the is­sue of re­shap­ing South Korean af­fairs “as re­quired by the pre­vail­ing sit­u­a­tion and the changed times” and dis­cussed for­eign pol­icy, the of­fi­cial KCNA news agency re­ported yes­ter­day, with­out elab­o­rat­ing.</p>
    <p>He “de­clared the gen­eral ori­en­ta­tion and the pol­icy stand of our party for com­pre­hen­sively ex­pand­ing and de­vel­op­ing the ex­ter­nal re­la­tions”, it added.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will come into of­fice fac­ing the thorny task of en­gi­neer­ing a break­through in the stale­mate, af­ter a sec­ond sum­mit be­tween Mr Kim and out­go­ing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in 2019 failed to reach agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Yang Moo-jin from the Univer­sity of North Korean Stud­ies in Seoul said Mr Kim was likely seek­ing to play a more proac­tive role in South Korea and US ties, em­bold­ened by his coun­try’s el­e­vated stand­ing af­ter suc­cess­ful in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­sile tests in 2017 and sum­mits with Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“He ap­pears to be gaug­ing how to set re­la­tions with the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion based on what they see as a self-de­fen­sive nu­clear de­ter­rent,” said Prof Yang.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim is one of the few world lead­ers yet to ac­knowl­edge the US elec­tion re­sults. He has not made sub­stan­tive com­ments on his arms pro­gramme since un­veil­ing a new in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­sile at an Oc­to­ber mil­i­tary pa­rade.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has called Mr Kim a “thug” and said he would meet the North Korean leader only if he made moves to re­duce his nu­clear arse­nal.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s will­ing­ness to hold di­rect talks prompted an un­prece­dented flurry of di­plo­macy by the once reclu­sive Mr Kim, who also had meet­ings with more than a dozen world lead­ers in­clud­ing South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jaein and Chi­nese leader Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>Such meet­ings have slowed since Mr Trump walked out of a Fe­bru­ary 2019 sum­mit with Mr Kim and the North Korean leader re­sumed bal­lis­tic mis­sile launches.</p>
    <p>In June, North Korea blew up a US$15 mil­lion (S$19 mil­lion) joint li­ai­son of­fice that South Korea built north of the bor­der two years ago as a sym­bol of Mr Moon’s pol­icy of rec­on­cil­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon has urged the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to make gestures to re-en­gage North Korea, to lit­tle avail. He vowed in re­marks on Thurs­day to con­tinue working to im­prove re­la­tions with Pyongyang “un­til the end”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s camp has sig­nalled more room for ne­go­ti­a­tions and his choice for sec­re­tary of state, Mr Antony Blinken, has backed a ne­go­ti­ated set­tle­ment with North Korea that first freezes and then rolls back its nu­clear pro­gramme in re­turn for re­wards.</p>
