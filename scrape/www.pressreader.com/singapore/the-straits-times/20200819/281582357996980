    <p>With less traf­fic on the roads dur­ing the circuit breaker, ac­ci­dents re­sult­ing in in­juries or fa­tal­i­ties fell by over 30 per cent in the first half of this year. There were 2,565 such ac­ci­dents recorded from Jan­uary to June, down from 3,832 in the same pe­riod last year, fig­ures re­leased by the po­lice showed.</p>
    <p>With less traf­fic on the roads dur­ing the circuit breaker pe­riod, traf­fic ac­ci­dents re­sult­ing in in­juries or fa­tal­i­ties fell by more than 30 per cent in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>There were 2,565 such ac­ci­dents recorded from Jan­uary to June this year, down from 3,832 in the same pe­riod last year, fig­ures re­leased yes­ter­day by the po­lice show.</p>
    <p>The to­tal fa­tal­i­ties and in­juries recorded on the road also fell by 37 per cent to 3,071 – con­sist­ing of 50 deaths and 3,021 in­juries – down from the 4,876 in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>But the qui­eter roads dur­ing the circuit breaker from April 7 to June 1 might also have en­ticed more mo­torists to speed, judg­ing by the 5.2 per cent rise in those caught for speed­ing in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>There were 94,359 speed­ing vi­o­la­tions in the first six months of this year, up from 89,718 last year.</p>
    <p>“The Traf­fic Po­lice take a se­ri­ous view of such vi­o­la­tions, which put the lives of mo­torists and other road users at great risk. Mo­torists should keep within the speed lim­its at all times,” said the po­lice in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, speed­ing-re­lated ac­ci­dents fell slightly by 8.1 per cent to 329, down from 358 in the first six months of last year.</p>
    <p>Mo­torists also ran fewer red lights in the first half of the year – such vi­o­la­tions fell 14.3 per cent to 24,169, down from 28,208 last year.</p>
    <p>The po­lice recorded 40 red-light run­ning ac­ci­dents, a 59.6 per cent drop from 99 last year.</p>
    <p>The tem­po­rary clo­sure of drink­ing holes and nightlife es­tab­lish­ments dur­ing the circuit breaker could also have con­trib­uted to a fall in drink-driv­ing cases.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said drink-driv­ing ar­rests fell by al­most a third – 661 driv­ers were nabbed this year, com­pared with 971 last year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, fa­tal drink-driv­ing ac­ci­dents inched up. Out of the 55 drink-driv­ing ac­ci­dents recorded this year, six re­sulted in fa­tal­i­ties. Last year, four of the 86 drink-driv­ing ac­ci­dents in­volved fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Er­rant mo­torists now face heav­ier im­pris­on­ment terms and fines if con­victed of driv­ing of­fences, after amend­ments to the Road Traf­fic Act came into ef­fect last Novem­ber, said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Those caught drink driv­ing for the first time could face a jail term of up to 12 months, and a fine of be­tween $2,000 and $10,000. Re­peat of­fend­ers could face up to two years’ jail, and a fine of be­tween $5,000 and $20,000.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also said they re­main con­cerned about ac­ci­dents in­volv­ing el­derly pedes­tri­ans and mo­tor­cy­clists, who “con­tinue to ac­count for a dis­pro­por­tion­ate num­ber of traf­fic ac­ci­dents re­sult­ing in in­juries or death”.</p>
    <p>El­derly pedes­tri­ans ac­counted for about 100 road ac­ci­dent in­juries, and eight of the 50 deaths recorded in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor­cy­clists or pil­lion rid­ers ac­counted for 1,615 in­juries in road ac­ci­dents and 30 deaths.</p>
    <p>The po­lice ad­vise el­derly pedes­tri­ans to use pedes­trian cross­ings when cross­ing the roads, as about half of all ac­ci­dents in­volv­ing this group was due to jay­walk­ing.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also said they will con­tinue to work with stake­hold­ers to en­cour­age safer rid­ing habits among mo­tor­cy­clists, not­ing that bik­ers or their pil­lion rid­ers were in­volved in about 60 per cent of all traf­fic ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>The qui­eter roads dur­ing the circuit breaker might also have en­ticed more mo­torists to speed, judg­ing by the 5.2 per cent rise in those caught for speed­ing in the first half of this year.</p>
