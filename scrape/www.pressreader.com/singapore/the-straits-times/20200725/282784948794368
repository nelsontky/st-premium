    <p>If one had known Mr Tom Chen grow­ing up, it would be hard to pic­ture him driv­ing a per­for­mance coupe one day.</p>
    <p>He was a good-na­tured straight-A stu­dent with a pen­chant for chess and his first car, a Toy­ota Corolla Altis, was more in line with his down-to-earth char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>But to­day, the 38-year-old drives a Lexus LC500, the brand’s flag­ship coupe. It is not his first sports ride, though.</p>
    <p>As a 25-year-old fresh grad­u­ate in 2006, he bought the Corolla Altis, a fam­ily sedan, for prac­ti­cal and eco­nom­i­cal rea­sons: He had just started work­ing and wanted to be pru­dent. Be­sides, his par­ents used to own a Corolla and have al­ways said Toy­ota cars are re­li­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of an in­vest­ment firm in the ma­rine lo­gis­tics in­dus­try, drove the Corolla Altis for eight years be­fore sell­ing it. He was in­clined to stick with the Ja­panese mar­que as he had a good ex­pe­ri­ence with the Corolla Altis.</p>
    <p>How­ever, af­ter con­sid­er­ing ex­ec­u­tive sedans such as the Camry, he bought a sim­i­larly priced Toy­ota 86, a sports car, in 2013 as he felt sta­ble in his ca­reer and wanted a sportier ride.</p>
    <p>The petrol­head in him blos­somed as he read up on the rich his­tory of the AE86 (the ride that in­spired the mod­ern 86), joined car groups and did cos­metic en­hance­ments, such as chang­ing the spoiler and rims and low­er­ing the springs in the sports coupe.</p>
    <p>Though Mr Chen loved the drive and en­joyed the 86’s han­dling, he sold it in 2017 due to the lack of cabin and boot space. He up­graded to a sporty Lexus IS sedan, which he said was a “nat­u­ral step”.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the ex­tra horse­power and space, he picked the car be­cause he wanted to pam­per his wife, Ms Ng Chew Wee, who is in her 30s and heads the South-east Asia mar­ket­ing for a multi­na­tional com­pany. They have a 20-mon­thold daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Then, last Oc­to­ber, Mr Chen chanced upon two LC500 cars for sale on car web­site sgCarMart. Know­ing how rare it was to find the coupe for sale, he kept a close watch on them.</p>
    <p>He took a par­tic­u­lar fancy to one of them – a lim­ited-edi­tion ver­sion that was then about 20 months old and came in a rare blue hue.</p>
    <p>Af­ter do­ing home­work on the pric­ing and as­sess­ing his fi­nances, he man­aged to snag what he be­lieved was a “good buy” on the car of his de­sire. He would say only that he paid be­tween $300,000 and $400,000.</p>
    <p>Al­though it was the first time Mr Chen, who kept the Lexus IS, had bought a sec­ond-hand car, he was not too con­cerned as it came with full ser­vice records.</p>
    <p>He was also as­sured by the rave re­views the LC500 re­ceived in The Straits Times. The car clinched the ST Car of the Year ti­tle in 2017.</p>
    <p>Call­ing the LC500 his dream car, Mr Chen loves how it looks like a samu­rai blade, and ag­gres­sive and mas­cu­line from every an­gle.</p>
    <p>“The coupe can be civilised dur­ing my daily drive, but the throaty 5-litre V8 nat­u­rally as­pi­rated en­gine is a great boon when I have a need for speed,” he says.</p>
    <p>He is also de­lighted that his fam­ily loves the car. “Es­pe­cially my daugh­ter Ash­ley, who points to the moon­roof dur­ing rainy days and say ‘bub­bles’. The fam­ily moniker for the car is now the ‘Ash­ley500’,” says the proud father with a beam.</p>
