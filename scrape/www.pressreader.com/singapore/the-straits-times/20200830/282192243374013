    <p>Mr Zul­haqem Zulk­i­fli, 28, is used to see­ing neigh­bours stream in and out of his home, a two-bed­room rental flat in Queen­stown that he shares with his fa­ther and three younger sib­lings aged 24, 25 and 26.</p>
    <p>They come for any num­ber of rea­sons – help with read­ing let­ters from the Govern­ment, mar­riage coun­selling, or ad­vice on con­flict res­o­lu­tion from his fa­ther. Some­times, they ask for rice and in­stant noo­dles when they do not have enough to eat.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther Zulk­i­fli At­nawi, 60, a re­tired cleaner known in the area as a “kam­pung head”, is ever will­ing to help.</p>
    <p>This neigh­bourly spirit rubbed off on Mr Zul­haqem and his sib­lings, who came to­gether in April to launch Project Hills (face­book.com/ pro­jecthills) – a ground-up ini­tia­tive that pro­vides outreach and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to res­i­dents of rental hous­ing es­tates, in­clud­ing the one they live in.</p>
    <p>Mr Zul­haqem, who is do­ing a mas­ter’s de­gree in Bud­dhist stud­ies at Ox­ford Univer­sity, re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in March when the coro­n­avirus pan­demic wors­ened. Back home, he no­ticed many of his neigh­bours had fallen upon hard times. Those who faced pay cuts or re­trench­ments had dif­fi­culty mak­ing ends meet.</p>
    <p>It was a sit­u­a­tion he recog­nised all too well. Af­ter his par­ents di­vorced about a decade ago, he and his sib­lings shut­tled among var­i­ous rel­a­tives’ homes. They even spent a month or two sleep­ing in the void deck. His fa­ther even­tu­ally as­sumed care of all four chil­dren.</p>
    <p>It was a sea­son that shaped Mr Zul­haqem’s con­vic­tions.</p>
    <p>“My sib­lings and I have gone through tough times of pain and suf­fer­ing, so we want to make the world a bet­ter place, where oth­ers don’t have to suf­fer need­lessly,” he says.</p>
    <p>Starting with just the four of them, the vol­un­teer pool has grown by word of mouth to about 50 peo­ple, most of them un­der the age of 35.</p>
    <p>Outreach pro­grammes take place about once a week. Vol­un­teers go door to door to dis­trib­ute es­sen­tial items, top up the pre­paid credit to­kens res­i­dents use to get elec­tric­ity, or of­fer ad hoc as­sis­tance, such as sourcing a wheel­chair for a needy el­derly per­son or a lap­top for home­based learn­ing for a family.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of res­i­dents’ ma­te­rial needs, treat­ing them with dig­nity is para­mount, he says.</p>
    <p>Some, mis­trust­ful at first, opened up to share old slights from so­cial work­ers. One res­i­dent re­called be­ing asked why she had so many chil­dren if her family was not do­ing well. “For a group of peo­ple who do not have much in their lives, their dig­nity means a lot to them,” he notes.</p>
    <p>He of­ten re­minds vol­un­teers to com­mu­ni­cate clearly, while be­ing mind­ful of res­i­dents’ emo­tions. Some­times, all they need is a listening ear and some­one to chan­nel their re­quests to the right au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing I’ve seen and ex­pe­ri­enced grounds me and re­minds me to em­pathise with peo­ple, un­der­stand their prob­lems, and give them a voice,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing I’ve seen and ex­pe­ri­enced grounds me and re­minds me to em­pathise with peo­ple, un­der­stand their prob­lems, and give them a voice. ’’ Mr Zul­haqem Zulk­i­fli, who founded Project Hills with his sib­lings</p>
