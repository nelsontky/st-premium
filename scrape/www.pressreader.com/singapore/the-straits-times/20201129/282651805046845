    <p>It is no sur­prise that sus­tain­abil­ity is at the heart of en­tre­pre­neur Blair Crich­ton’s per­sonal and work life, given that his new en­deav­our is the de­cid­edly eco-friendly ven­ture of plant-based meat.</p>
    <p>His com­mit­ment means no in­vest­ments in com­pa­nies and prac­tices that have a neg­a­tive en­vi­ron­ment and so­cial im­pact, such as oil and to­bacco.</p>
    <p>Mr Crich­ton, 35, says: “I have al­ways been pas­sion­ate about the en­vi­ron­ment and I am in­creas­ingly con­cerned that we are not do­ing enough to ad­dress cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“Money talks, and I would rather put my money where my mouth is. By chan­nelling cap­i­tal into com­pa­nies that are cli­mate pos­i­tive, this sends a sig­nal to the mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>He adds that it would also be hyp­o­crit­i­cal to not use his own cap­i­tal to pro­mote pos­i­tive sus­tain­abil­ity out­comes as his firm Karana is a mis­sion-driven start-up that wants to end the de­struc­tion of an­i­mal agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Crich­ton, who grew up in Hong Kong and is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent there, is in Sin­ga­pore on an en­tre­pre­neur pass. He has Aus­tralian and Bri­tish cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>He started Karana two years ago after hav­ing worked at al­ter­na­tive meat com­pany Im­pos­si­ble Foods and HSBC in Shang­hai, Hong Kong and New York. His fa­ther is Aus­tralian and his mother Bri­tish.</p>
    <p>The firm’s plant-based pork al­ter­na­tive, which is made out of jack­fruit, will be launched in res­tau­rants shortly, he adds.</p>
    <p>Mr Crich­ton, who is not mar­ried, sold his in­vest­ment prop­erty in Hong Kong to pay off debts from busi­ness school and to sup­port him­self in Karana’s early days, and is now look­ing to re­build his port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>But with youth on his side and no chil­dren or mort­gage to worry about, he is also pre­pared to take big­ger risks, which is why he has set his sights on start-up in­vest­ments if the right op­por­tu­nity comes around.</p>
    <p>“If you’re go­ing to take risks, do so in some­thing that you are pas­sion­ate about and be­lieve in, it will have a much higher chance of suc­cess, par­tic­u­larly through tough times,” he said.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your per­sonal port­fo­lio? A My per­sonal port­fo­lio is heav­ily in­vested into Karana. I went for 31/ years with­out a salary, hav­ing</p>
    <p>2 boot­strapped the com­pany after busi­ness school.</p>
    <p>I have a few stock in­vest­ments, an in­vest­ment in a piece of art that is leased to a com­pany and a life in­sur­ance pol­icy. I liq­ui­dated a prop­erty in or­der to fund the last 31/ years.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Now that I am pay­ing my­self a mod­est salary again, I am look­ing at set­ting aside a por­tion every month into some funds through robo-in­vest­ment plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Right now, as I am still rel­a­tively young and do not have chil­dren or much debt, I have a slightly higher risk tol­er­ance.</p>
    <p>Most of my in­vest­ments are con­cen­trated in Sin­ga­pore, as this is where Karana is based. I am look­ing at spread­ing my in­vest­ments across both emerg­ing and de­vel­oped mar­kets, and do not have a ge­o­graph­i­cal pref­er­ence.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A As I re­build my port­fo­lio, I am look­ing at both a plat­form-man­aged in­vest­ment fund as well as some spec­u­la­tive in­vest­ments in higher-yield as­sets; I re­cently signed up to a crowd­fund­ing plat­form for start-ups based in Europe.</p>
    <p>Robo-ad­vis­ers tend to hold port­fo­lios that are pretty broad and thus track stock mar­ket per­for­mance, which, over the long term, if his­tory re­peats it­self, is one of the best in­vest­ments you can make.</p>
    <p>I am also con­sid­er­ing some Reit (real es­tate in­vest­ment trust) in</p>
    <p>vest­ments, par­tic­u­larly those with an in­dus­trial fo­cus on things like data cen­tres, ware­hous­ing and other e-com­merce ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The rea­son be­hind the in­ter­est in Reits is that they en­able me to have prop­erty ex­po­sure but with­out the large out­lay of cap­i­tal or a mort­gage, which I am not in a po­si­tion to take up right now.</p>
    <p>More­over, Reits have been pay­ing good yields re­cently and I am bullish on cer­tain prop­erty cat­e­gories such as data cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan?</p>
    <p>A I would like to get back on the prop­erty lad­der again and hope­fully in the not-too-dis­tant fu­ture, chil­dren will be a fea­ture of my life, which will re­quire a whole other ap­proach to saving and watch­ing my spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Right now, I am fo­cused on re­build­ing some dis­ci­pline back into my fi­nances and set­ting aside small amounts each month to in­vest.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A Re­tire­ment seems a long way off for me. I am 35 years old, and have</p>
    <p>just founded a start-up, so I am not re­ally think­ing about that at this stage.</p>
    <p>I doubt I will ever fully re­tire, and I take in­spi­ra­tion from my grand­mother, who was an en­tre­pre­neur and busi­ness­woman who worked un­til the day she died.</p>
    <p>Of course, I hope that I will not be work­ing the kind of hours I am now putting in dur­ing my later years, but I think I would get bored if my brain was not en­gaged in build­ing and cre­at­ing things.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A Money is not a huge driver for me be­yond want­ing to pro­vide for my chil­dren and fam­ily – when I have one – the same kind of op­por­tu­ni­ties and lifestyle my par­ents gave me. I value ex­pe­ri­ences and am highly grate­ful for the amaz­ing ex­pe­ri­ences I have had. To that ex­tent, money is just an en­abler of th­ese things.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, I care deeply about cre­at­ing a bet­ter world, in my case with a fo­cus on cli­mate change, and I know full well that much tran­si­tion won’t hap­pen with­out busi­ness mod­els that work and are prof­itable. So I am laser-fo­cused on</p>
    <p>that, but it is not the profit that is driv­ing me. Rather, it’s the mis­sion be­hind that profit.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now... A</p>
    <p>I live in the Joo Chiat neigh­bour­hood, in a large one-bed­room apart­ment on the up­per level of a shop­house unit.</p>
    <p>It’s a rented prop­erty and I love this neigh­bour­hood, its mix of old­school cof­fee shops and eater­ies along­side some great new cafes, mi­cro-brew­eries and yoga stu­dios.</p>
    <p>As some­one rel­a­tively new to Sin­ga­pore, I love the chance to live in a her­itage prop­erty, es­pe­cially since in Hong Kong, where I am from, many of the his­toric build­ings have sadly been de­mol­ished.</p>
    <p>Q I drive... A</p>
    <p>I do not drive. As much as I can, I get around on my road bike and public trans­port. It’s much bet­ter for the en­vi­ron­ment and my health.</p>
    <p>Plus, when­ever I do need a car, the eco­nomics of ride-hail­ing ver­sus own­er­ship are clear-cut in favour of ride-hail­ing.</p>
    <p>SPREAD­ING OUT IN­VEST­MENTS</p>
    <p>Most of my in­vest­ments are con­cen­trated in Sin­ga­pore, as this is where Karana is based. I am look­ing at spread­ing my in­vest­ments across both emerg­ing and de­vel­oped mar­kets, and do not have a ge­o­graph­i­cal pref­er­ence.</p>
