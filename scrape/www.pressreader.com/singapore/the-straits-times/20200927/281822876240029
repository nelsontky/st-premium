    <p>An un­der­grad­u­ate who took 469 up­skirt and up­shirt videos of 335 women over about six months was sen­tenced to nine months and three weeks’ jail last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Shaun Ho Yan Liang, 26, struck be­tween Fe­bru­ary and July in 2018 at var­i­ous lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity (NTU) cam­pus, where he was study­ing psy­chol­ogy.</p>
    <p>He pleaded guilty on Sept 16 to two charges of in­sult­ing the women’s mod­esty, as well as one charge of be­ing in pos­ses­sion of ob­scene videos.</p>
    <p>District Judge Adam Nakhoda re­ferred to Ho’s crimes as an “of­fend­ing spree” dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>He said Ho’s crimes were pre­med­i­tated since he “tar­geted vic­tims in the ap­pro­pri­ate cloth­ing” be­fore film­ing them in a “brazen man­ner”.</p>
    <p>The judge noted that while Ho seemed like a “bright in­di­vid­ual”, his aca­demic qual­i­fi­ca­tions were not rel­e­vant in this case.</p>
    <p>Ho’s crimes came to light when he was caught in the act at a FairPrice out­let at East­point Mall in Simei on July 22, 2018.</p>
    <p>He fol­lowed a woman in denim shorts and a loose white T-shirt around the su­per­mar­ket, record­ing videos of her.</p>
    <p>He took 10 videos of her by stand­ing or squat­ting di­rectly be­hind her and po­si­tion­ing his phone below the waist level or close to ground level, with the rear cam­era of the phone pointed up­wards to film up­shirt or up­skirt videos.</p>
    <p>The woman’s boyfriend caught Ho with his phone pointed un­der her T-shirt and re­ported the in­ci­dent to the store’s se­cu­rity of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties later found 459 other videos of fe­male vic­tims on Ho’s phone shot be­tween Feb 2 and July 22 in 2018.</p>
    <p>On each oc­ca­sion, Ho tar­geted women wear­ing shorts or skirts</p>
    <p>whom he found at­trac­tive. He would use his phone to record videos of the women’s breasts, un­der­shirt or crotch by stand­ing or squat­ting close to them.</p>
    <p>Among the places he struck were a lab­o­ra­tory of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion’s School of Sci­ence, and an over­head bridge and a stu­dent ac­tiv­ity cen­tre in NTU.</p>
    <p>Ho would even record the videos of his vic­tims dur­ing lessons at NTU.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties also found 106 ob­scene and porno­graphic videos on his lap­top.</p>
    <p>Ho’s lawyer Ch­eryl Sim of Re­gent Law noted that Ho had at­tended nu­mer­ous coun­selling ses­sions over the past two years.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Sean Teh re­it­er­ated that Ho’s “voyeurism does not de­prive him of self-con­trol”.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the court, Ho said he felt “a very huge sense of re­lief” af­ter be­ing caught and that he “owes apolo­gies to all the peo­ple (he) has hurt”. He also urged other of­fend­ers to “seek help as soon as pos­si­ble (and not to) hurt any more peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>On Sept 16, a spokesman for NTU said Ho is still a stu­dent there, although he no longer at­tended classes. He will be sub­ject to dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the court, Ho said he felt “a very huge sense of re­lief” af­ter be­ing caught and that he “owes apolo­gies to all the peo­ple (he) has hurt”. He also urged other of­fend­ers to “seek help as soon as pos­si­ble (and not to) hurt any more peo­ple”.</p>
