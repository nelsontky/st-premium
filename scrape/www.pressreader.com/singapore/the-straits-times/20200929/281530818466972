    <p>New op­por­tu­ni­ties have emerged for job seek­ers in Malaysia amid the pan­demic, which has taken lives and liveli­hoods around the world. The coun­try’s job­less rates are fall­ing as its econ­omy sput­ters back to life af­ter months of move­ment curbs that had sent un­em­ploy­ment fig­ures soar­ing.</p>
    <p>At the height of the Covid-19 pan­demic in April, car sales­man Muham­mad Nas­rul Musa lost ev­ery­thing he had – his job, his sav­ings, and even his car.</p>
    <p>But things started to look up af­ter Malaysia’s move­ment curbs were lifted in stages from May, when the coun­try cau­tiously re­opened many sec­tors, pro­vid­ing new jobs for the thou­sands who were laid off overnight.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Nas­rul, 40, said he is slowly re­gain­ing his foot­ing af­ter he man­aged to get a job as a re­search con­sul­tant at a firm in Glen­marie, Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>“It’s a part-time gig but I’m very happy be­cause even though there are a lot of com­pa­nies look­ing for peo­ple now, the truth is it’s not as easy to land one,” the fa­ther of two told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ms Noor Laily Iz­zati Hamid, 37, was re­trenched from her job as a clerk not long af­ter the Move­ment Con­trol Or­der (MCO) was im­posed on March 18, shut­ting down all sec­tors save for es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>On see­ing a spike in de­mand for on­line shop­ping and home de­liv­er­ies, she de­cided to try her hand at pro­vid­ing these ser­vices to sup­port her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“I was re­trenched in late March. It was so sud­den but in­stead of dwelling on it, I de­cided to start an on­line busi­ness on top of be­com­ing a Food­panda de­liv­ery rider,” said the mother of three, who now earns at least RM2,000 (S$660) more than what she pre­vi­ously did.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Nas­rul and Ms Noor Laily are just two ex­am­ples of how new op­por­tu­ni­ties have emerged for job-seek­ers amid the pan­demic, which has taken lives and liveli­hoods from around the world as gov­ern­ments bat­tle the deadly virus.</p>
    <p>In May, two months af­ter Malaysia im­ple­mented the MCO, the un­em­ploy­ment rate went up to 5.3 per cent, from 5 per cent in April and 3.9 per cent in March.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it be­gan a grad­ual down­ward trend af­ter curbs were grad­u­ally re­laxed, drop­ping to 4.9 per cent in June and dip­ping fur­ther to 4.7 per cent in July.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s un­em­ploy­ment rates hov­ered be­tween 3.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent late last year.</p>
    <p>A Grab spokesman told ST: “Covid-19 has def­i­nitely high­lighted how the gig econ­omy has be­come an in­te­gral part of the new econ­omy. Dur­ing the move­ment con­trol, when many Malaysians lost their in­come, it cre­ated earn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for those who needed them.”</p>
    <p>More than 10,000 peo­ple joined Grab as driver and de­liv­ery part­ners dur­ing the re­cov­ery phase of the MCO.</p>
    <p>The de­mand for de­liv­ery ser­vices also rose sig­nif­i­cantly dur­ing the par­tial shut­down.</p>
    <p>“Our de­liv­er­ies grew by more than 30 per cent, there­fore we had to pivot our ser­vices and op­er­a­tions to en­sure all our part­ners’ liveli­hoods were pro­tected.</p>
    <p>“This included mov­ing over 100,000 driv­ers to sup­port de­liv­er­ies to pro­vide them an al­ter­na­tive source of in­come, as our trans­port busi­ness was heav­ily af­fected.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of em­ployed per­sons in July was 15.07 mil­lion, an in­crease of 0.6 per cent from June, ac­cord­ing to Malaysia’s chief statis­ti­cian Mohd Uzir Mahidin.</p>
    <p>Most eco­nomic sec­tors, such as those re­lated to ed­u­ca­tion and tourism, have posted an in­crease in the num­ber of em­ployed per­sons since June as sec­tors slowly re­opened. How­ever, the fig­ures are still not on par with those recorded be­fore the pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>“Al­though the labour mar­ket is within the path to re­cov­ery, the num­ber of un­em­ployed was still high as against the pe­riod of Jan­uary to Fe­bru­ary this year, where the av­er­age num­ber of un­em­ployed was about 518,000,” Datuk Seri Mohd Uzir told ST.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has in­tro­duced sev­eral ini­tia­tives and stim­u­lus pack­ages since end-March to aid cit­i­zens, in­clud­ing pro­vid­ing wage sub­si­dies, reskilling and up­skilling pro­grammes, hir­ing and train­ing as­sis­tance as well as so­cial pro­tec­tion for the gig econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Mohd Uzir noted that with the re­open­ing of child­care cen­tres, schools, uni­ver­si­ties and col­leges, re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties such as school bus ser­vices, can­teens and tu­ition cen­tres have also felt the pos­i­tive im­pact.</p>
    <p>Par­ents are able to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>Many have also taken the op­por­tu­nity to travel do­mes­ti­cally, amid the con­tin­ued clo­sure of Malaysia’s bor­ders un­til Dec 31. As such, de­mand for ac­com­mo­da­tion, food and bev­er­ages, en­ter­tain­ment and recre­ational ser­vices has risen in tan­dem, en­cour­ag­ing busi­nesses to re­tain or even in­crease job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“In other words, the re­sump­tion of eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties has re­sulted in the re­vival of the labour force sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s econ­omy is show­ing signs of grad­ual re­cov­ery in the com­ing months, pro­vided the coun­try con­tin­ues to con­tain the out­break, Mr Mohd Uzir added.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Covid-19 cases, how­ever, has risen over the last week. On Sun­day, there were 150 new cases and one death, from 82 cases on Satur­day.</p>
