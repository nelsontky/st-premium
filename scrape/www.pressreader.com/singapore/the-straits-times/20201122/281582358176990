    <p>Home-grown fun­ny­man Mark Lee, nom­i­nated for Best Lead­ing Ac­tor at the Golden Horse Awards, went home empty-handed last night, but the Sin­ga­pore film he starred in picked up a tro­phy.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal mu­si­cal com­edy Num­ber 1, in which Lee plays a re­trenched man who finds a job as a drag queen, won the award for Best Makeup and Cos­tume De­sign.</p>
    <p>The film’s stylist Ray­mond Kuek, a Malaysian, ac­cepted the award with the film’s direc­tor, Sin­ga­porean Ong Kuo Sin. Sin­ga­porean cos­tume de­signer Azni Samdin was not at the cer­e­mony but posted news of the win on his In­sta­gram ac­count.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­bly thrilled when ac­cept­ing his award, Mr Kuek thanked the cast and crew of Num­ber 1, the Golden Horse Awards judges and his par­ents for giv­ing birth to a “short but tal­ented man”.</p>
    <p>He ended his speech by speak­ing in Malay: “Thank you to the makeup artists and the team who made this film so good. Ter­ima kasih (Thank you).”</p>
    <p>Ong said: “We’re go­ing to take this award and what it means back to Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia and tell the film-mak­ers there: ‘If we can do it, so can you!’”</p>
    <p>Lee, 52, who lost the Best Lead­ing Ac­tor hon­our to Tai­wanese Mo Tzu-yi for his role in Dear Ten­ant, told The Sun­day Times: “Even though I didn’t win, I gained a lot from my trip here and ex­pe­ri­enced an in­ter­na­tion­ally pres­ti­gious film fes­ti­val and awards cer­e­mony and got to know many peo­ple in the film in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“I hope my nom­i­na­tion isn’t just val­i­da­tion for me alone, but can also be an en­cour­age­ment for peo­ple in Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore work­ing in film. Never give up on your movie dreams.”</p>
    <p>An­other Sin­ga­porean who went home happy was song­writer Tan Boon Wah, who took home the Best Orig­i­nal Film Song award for Your Name En­graved Herein – the theme song for the ho­mo­sex­u­althemed ro­mance movie of the same name.</p>
    <p>The song, per­formed by Crowd Lu and the film’s ac­tor Ed­ward Chen, was writ­ten by Tan and Malaysian song­writ­ers Keon Chia and Hooi Yuan Teng. The trio col­lected their award with Chen, while Lu joined in from Kaoh­si­ung in south­ern Tai­wan via video call.</p>
    <p>Tan said on-stage: “I’m Tan Boon Wah from Sin­ga­pore. I’ve watched the Golden Horse Awards cer­e­mony since I was a kid. I never thought I’ll be up here one day, mak­ing my coun­try proud.”</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old, a cor­po­rate real es­tate lawyer by day, also thanked his law firm Allen & Gled­hill, where he is a part­ner: “Thank you for al­low­ing me to ful­fil my dream of be­ing a lawyer while giv­ing me the space to pur­sue my pas­sion in mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>The big­gest win­ner of the night was the whim­si­cal fan­tasy ro­mance My Miss­ing Valen­tine, which took home five awards, in­clud­ing Best Nar­ra­tive Fea­ture and Best Direc­tor for Chen Yu-hsun.</p>
    <p>Dram­edy Class­mates Mi­nus also did well with three awards, in­clud­ing Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tor for Nadow Lin, bet­ter known as the host of va­ri­ety se­ries Col­lege Talk (2007-2016).</p>
    <p>The event was one of the rare ma­jor awards cer­e­monies held this year amid the global Covid-19 pan­demic. Tai­wan has kept its Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion largely un­der con­trol, and at­ten­dees from overseas had to quar­an­tine for 14 days. Guests at the glitzy event mostly wore spe­cially cus­tomised Golden Horse Awards masks when they were not ap­pear­ing on stage.</p>
    <p>Golden Horse fes­ti­val chair­man and Oscar-win­ning direc­tor Ang Lee thanked at­ten­dees for show­ing up de­spite hav­ing to ad­here to Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese films were no­tably ab­sent due to China’s on­go­ing boy­cott of the cer­e­mony – long dubbed the Os­cars of Chi­nese cin­ema. Ris­ing ten­sions be­tween Taipei and Bei­jing led China to is­sue a boy­cott of the awards show last year.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese films and a hand­ful of Hong Kong, Malaysian and Sin­ga­pore works pop­u­lated the nom­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>An­other Sin­ga­pore-re­lated pro­ject, the thriller Pre­cious Is The Night – a Sin­ga­pore-Tai­wan pro­duc­tion – did not win in ei­ther of its cat­e­gories in cin­e­matog­ra­phy and makeup and cos­tume de­sign.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing film, which is set in 1960s Sin­ga­pore, is led by Sin­ga­porean pho­tog­ra­pher-turnedIn­ter­net-star Chuando Tan.</p>
    <p>The big­gest in­di­vid­ual win­ner of the night was vet­eran Tai­wanese ac­tress Chen Shu-fang, who took home both Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress and Best Lead­ing Ac­tress awards for her roles in Dear Ten­ant and Lit­tle Big Women re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>This was the first nom­i­na­tion for Chen, who is in her 80s, in her 63-year-long ca­reer. She was also nom­i­nated for Best Orig­i­nal Film Song as a per­former.</p>
    <p>Tear­ing up when she col­lected her Best Lead­ing Ac­tress tro­phy, she said: “The tro­phy is so heavy. But even so, I will clutch it tightly.”</p>
    <p>DREAM COME TRUE</p>
    <p>I’ve watched the Golden Horse Awards cer­e­mony since I was a kid. I never thought I’ll be up here one day, mak­ing my coun­try proud.</p>
