    <p>In­come in­equal­ity is widen­ing across the world with rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tions and the pan­demic ex­ac­er­bat­ing the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Low-in­come groups tend to be highly de­pen­dent on de­posit sav­ings, which leaves them vul­ner­a­ble to in­fla­tion, es­pe­cially when in­ter­est rates are low.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, many from lower-in­come groups do not have the means to grow their wealth, due in part to a lack of know-how, no tools and re­sources to mon­i­tor mar­kets, and lit­tle ex­cess sav­ings to in­vest.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions across the world have also been un­able to scale ef­fec­tive money man­age­ment so­lu­tions to a large num­ber of cus­tomers while fin­techs, over the years, are still try­ing to fill the gap.</p>
    <p>As more peo­ple shift their bank­ing needs to dig­i­tal plat­forms, the re­cently launched pub­lic-pri­vate open bank­ing plat­form SGFinDex (Sin­ga­pore Fi­nan­cial Data Ex­change) might just be the cat­a­lyst to turn things around.</p>
    <p>Top of the list is greater fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion so that more peo­ple will have ac­cess to suit­able and af­ford­able dig­i­tal prod­ucts and ser­vices that are crit­i­cal to re­duc­ing the wealth gap. In the past, peo­ple have had to rely solely on fi­nan­cial ad­vis­ers for plan­ning.</p>
    <p>But the com­bi­na­tion of data and tech­nol­ogy has now made it pos­si­ble to help any­one make their money work harder for them.</p>
    <p>SGFinDex al­lows cus­tomers to eas­ily con­sol­i­date their fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion across govern­ment bod­ies such as the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Board, In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and banks in one place.</p>
    <p>Their re­trieved data will be trans­mit­ted to dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial plan­ning tools or ap­pli­ca­tions from the seven par­tic­i­pat­ing banks or the na­tional fi­nan­cial ed­u­ca­tion pro­gramme MoneySense, to of­fer a seam­less and ef­fi­cient way of man­ag­ing fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, the in­di­vid­ual is in the driver’s seat, with the abil­ity to con­tin­u­ously as­sess his or her fi­nan­cial health eas­ily and make in­formed de­ci­sions. For in­stance, cus­tomers can con­nect their fi­nances and choose to dis­con­nect if they change their minds. Data is re­freshed only when they want to.</p>
    <p>They will soon also be able to re­trieve other fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion like in­surance and shares via SGFinDex.</p>
    <p>DEMOCRATI­SA­TION OF WEALTH</p>
    <p>There is a very real op­por­tu­nity now to nar­row the in­come in­equal­ity gap by help­ing lower-in­come groups to bet­ter man­age their money.</p>
    <p>That is why DBS ear­lier this year launched its dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial and re­tire­ment plan­ning tool DBS NAV Plan­ner, which can con­sol­i­date in­di­vid­u­als’ fi­nances across the in­dus­try, pro­vide hy­per-per­son­alised ad­vice and ac­tion­able in­sights to en­sure they are ad­e­quately pre­pared for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>More than 1.8 mil­lion cus­tomers have used DBS NAV Plan­ner since April, with more than 400,000 able to turn their fi­nances around, mak­ing them pos­i­tive net savers.</p>
    <p>The tool is pop­u­lar among lower-in­come groups. Over half of the 1.8 mil­lion users earn $2,999 or less each month, while 23 per cent earn be­tween $3,000 and $4,999.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial plan­ning tools like DBS NAV Plan­ner have got a big boost with the launch of SGFinDex, al­low­ing more Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents to con­sol­i­date their fi­nan­cial data from dif­fer­ent sources for greater clar­ity of their bal­ance sheets.</p>
    <p>Be­fore SGFinDex’s launch, more than 40,000 cus­tomers had al­ready man­u­ally in­put their ex­ter­nal hold­ings in DBS NAV Plan­ner. This is largely due to the higher lev­els of trust to­wards banks in Sin­ga­pore than seen in some mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the adop­tion of dig­i­tal bank­ing and money man­age­ment tools. This has led many</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans to go dig­i­tal, jump-start­ing their in­vest­ing jour­ney via dig­i­tal plat­forms. Those who are not so tech-savvy are not left out, as they can con­tinue to seek guid­ance via face-to-face con­sul­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Over time, con­sumers who are deemed “un­der­banked” – no ac­cess to credit cards, no long-term sav­ings prod­ucts and be­ing un­der­in­sured – should de­crease. As their fi­nan­cial knowl­edge grows, fi­nan­cial bar­ri­ers will also be low­ered.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion will then be en­hanced, chip­ping away at the Gini co­ef­fi­cient (which mea­sures in­come in­equal­ity) and in­come and so­cial in­equal­ity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Now that a cus­tomer’s per­sonal bal­ance sheet can be cap­tured more eas­ily with SGFinDex, the onus is on banks to help con­sumers bridge gaps with a holis­tic fi­nan­cial plan­ning of­fer­ing at ev­ery in­come level, in­stead of sell­ing so­lu­tions in si­los.</p>
    <p>The winds of change have ar­rived and those who mis­read the signs will be left be­hind. Con­sumers will seek out fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions that of­fer so­lu­tions that bet­ter serve their needs.</p>
    <p>What dis­tin­guishes a great fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion that can bet­ter serve cus­tomers from a good one?</p>
    <p>I be­lieve it is one that has built up a pro­pri­etary fi­nan­cial plan­ning frame­work that en­sures con­sis­tent de­liv­ery of ad­vice to con­sumers, re­gard­less of their pref­er­ence for on­line, off­line or hy­brid chan­nels.</p>
    <p>This frame­work places a big em­pha­sis on com­pre­hen­sive fi­nan­cial plan­ning and en­cour­ages con­sumers to max­imise govern­ment schemes like the CPF and Sup­ple­men­tary Re­tire­ment Scheme, and at the same time, em­braces the best prac­tices and bench­marks from es­tab­lished or­gan­i­sa­tions like the Fi­nan­cial Plan­ning As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore and the Life In­surance As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions should also har­ness big data an­a­lyt­ics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to un­der­stand fi­nan­cial be­hav­iour and trends re­sult­ing in en­hanced cus­tomer en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>With dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial plan­ning tools at cus­tomers’ fin­ger­tips, map­ping out their fi­nan­cial jour­ney and goals is no longer as dif­fi­cult or cum­ber­some as it is of­ten made out to be. The fu­ture they de­sire will be­come a re­al­ity.</p>

    <p>This is the last of a five-part se­ries on key trends that will shape the fu­ture of bank­ing.</p>
