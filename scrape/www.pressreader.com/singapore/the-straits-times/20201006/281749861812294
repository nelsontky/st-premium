    <p>Global co­op­er­a­tion within a rules­based mul­ti­lat­eral sys­tem is more im­por­tant than ever for coun­tries deal­ing with col­lec­tive chal­lenges in cy­ber se­cu­rity and the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor, even as the world grows more po­larised in some ways, said Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran, who is also Min­is­ter-in-charge of Cy­ber­se­cu­rity, likened his vi­sion for the global cy­ber land­scape to the ex­ist­ing mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem, which is gov­erned by a set of com­mon rules all coun­tries abide by but also al­lows for closer col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween part­ners whose in­ter­ests con­verge.</p>
    <p>“In the case of cy­ber se­cu­rity, the work that’s be­ing done in the United Na­tions, for ex­am­ple... is very im­por­tant in de­vel­op­ing that mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proach,” said Mr Iswaran, who was speak­ing at a di­a­logue ti­tled “The Fu­ture Tech Land­scape: Bipo­lar?”, which was the open­ing event of this year’s Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Cy­ber Week (SICW).</p>
    <p>“But I think there’s an im­por­tant role for re­gional part­ner­ships... that al­lows like-minded coun­tries to work to­gether and start mov­ing at a pace that is per­haps faster and in a man­ner that is more in­no­va­tive than what you might be able to achieve in a mul­ti­lat­eral plat­form.”</p>
    <p>The world’s two su­per­pow­ers, the United States and China, are locked in a mu­tu­ally dam­ag­ing trade and tech­nol­ogy war that has only in­ten­si­fied with the on­set of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This ten­sion and the split­ting of tech­nol­ogy or cy­ber-se­cu­rity stan­dards into one side ver­sus an­other side from two ma­jor tech­nol­ogy</p>
    <p>You need the cre­ativ­ity and the push from the pri­vate sec­tor in terms of be­ing at the cut­ting edge, and then you need the leav­en­ing in­flu­ence of gov­ern­ment be­cause we have to take into ac­count the im­pact on so­ci­ety and the econ­omy, and how to bring ev­ery­body along. We know that we start from dif­fer­ent places but let’s try and find a way to make com­mon cause. Be­cause if you take the ap­proach that the gov­ern­ment doesn’t trust the pri­vate sec­tor... and the pri­vate sec­tor views the gov­ern­ment as ba­si­cally ob­struc­tion­ist, then we have a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>COM­MU­NI­CA­TIONS AND IN­FOR­MA­TION MIN­IS­TER S. ISWARAN, on the pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tors work­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>providers has sig­nif­i­cant im­pli­ca­tions for the rest of the world, said Bain and Com­pany tech­nol­ogy con­sul­tant Syed Ali, who was speak­ing at the same di­a­logue as Mr Iswaran.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, it ranges from won­der­ing what the (cy­ber se­cu­rity) stan­dard is go­ing to be for hard­ware (used in) the rolling out of 5G tech­nol­ogy and how the dif­fer­ent com­po­nents com­mu­ni­cate with each other, down to the soft­ware level and (how) the data is stored,” said Mr Syed.</p>
    <p>“Cy­ber-se­cu­rity so­lu­tions have had to es­sen­tially split be­cause of this (con­flict).”</p>
    <p>World Eco­nomic Fo­rum man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Mu­rat Son­mez said find­ing a global con­sen­sus in terms of how data flows are man­aged and se­cured will be hard, but there is also an in­creased de­sire among coun­tries to col­lab­o­rate on shared is­sues or chal­lenges such as cli­mate change, con­ges­tion in cities and the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We should not con­flate mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism with una­nim­ity... in a mul­ti­stake­holder dis­cus­sion or di­a­logue,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran also em­pha­sised the need for stronger col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween gov­ern­ments and the pri­vate sec­tor to max­imise the ben­e­fits of emerg­ing tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“You need the cre­ativ­ity and the push from the pri­vate sec­tor in terms of be­ing at the cut­ting edge, and then you need the leav­en­ing in­flu­ence of gov­ern­ment be­cause we have to take into ac­count the im­pact on so­ci­ety and the econ­omy, and how to bring ev­ery­body along,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We know that we start from dif­fer­ent places but let’s try and find a way to make com­mon cause. Be­cause if you take the ap­proach that the gov­ern­ment doesn’t trust the pri­vate sec­tor... and the pri­vate sec­tor views the gov­ern­ment as ba­si­cally ob­struc­tion­ist, then we have a prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>SICW 2020 is be­ing held in a mostly vir­tual for­mat ow­ing to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and travel re­stric­tions, and will con­clude on Fri­day. Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat is ex­pected to speak in de­tail on Sin­ga­pore’s cy­ber-se­cu­rity strat­egy to­day.</p>
