    <p>Singapore’s Mufti, the high­est Is­lamic au­thor­ity here, has made an ex­ec­u­tive de­ci­sion to per­mit Covid-19 vac­cines for Mus­lims here, re­gard­less of their in­gre­di­ents, due to the ur­gency of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>While re­li­gious guid­ance is typ­i­cally made by the Fatwa Com­mit­tee, the guid­ance over the Covid-19 vaccine re­leased on Sun­day was made di­rectly from the Of­fice of the Mufti.</p>
    <p>“When the vac­cines are avail­able in Singapore for safe use, I would strongly urge the Mus­lim com­mu­nity to take up the vaccine, as part of our con­tri­bu­tion (to so­ci­ety), and not to worry about whether you are al­lowed to do so, be­cause the re­li­gious guid­ance is very clear on this mat­ter,” Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said yesterday.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia at the Singapore Is­lamic Hub in Brad­dell Road, Dr Nazirudin said the im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity is to pro­tect lives and keep ev­ery­one safe, so that re­li­gious and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties can re­sume in a safe and re­spon­si­ble way.</p>
    <p>“And we know the dif­fer­ence that the vaccine will make to help us achieve th­ese ob­jec­tives,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that there are con­cerns in some parts of the Mus­lim world over the in­gre­di­ents of the vac­cines, as Mus­lims have strict di­etary re­quire­ments and can­not con­sume food or in­gre­di­ents de­rived from pigs.</p>
    <p>“So when Mus­lims look at this, they might be con­cerned as to whether we can take such medicines or drugs. It is a gen­eral con­cern. And the fatwa was is­sued to pro­vide as­sur­ance to Mus­lims that they can con­sume,” said Dr Nazirudin.</p>
    <p>He said that in the con­text of a global pan­demic, tak­ing a vaccine helps to save lives and pro­tect liveli­hoods, and “th­ese are ob­jec­tives that are clearly part of the teach­ings of Is­lam”.</p>
    <p>He noted that the re­li­gious guid­ance was is­sued pre-emp­tively and was not merely a re­sponse to brewing con­cerns on the ground, say­ing that Mus­lims in Singapore are not “pre­oc­cu­pied with this be­cause there have been prece­dents”.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a fatwa was is­sued in 2013 when there was a ro­tavirus out­break, rul­ing that vac­cines are a form of pre­ven­tive treat­ment from diseases and en­cour­aged in Is­lam.</p>
    <p>In 2015, there was also a rul­ing on the drug Heparin, a blood thin­ner which con­tains pig en­zymes, said Dr Nazirudin.</p>
    <p>He pointed to the Is­lamic con­cept of Isti­ha­lah, which recog­nises that cer­tain sub­stances may go through pro­cesses that change the form of the sub­stances, par­tic­u­larly in the devel­op­ment of medicines.</p>
    <p>“The change of that sub­stance may have ren­dered that par­tic­u­lar sub­stance neg­li­gi­ble and al­most un­de­tectable in the fi­nal prod­uct,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“When the vaccine or medicine in the end does not con­tain any more sub­stances or an­i­mal cells, th­ese medicines or vac­cines are con­sid­ered per­mis­si­ble in Is­lam be­cause they have gone through this process of Isti­ha­lah, which changes the na­ture of the sub­stance.”</p>
    <p>He added that there are also Covid-19 vac­cines which are com­pletely syn­thetic and do not con­tain any an­i­mal sub­stances.</p>
    <p>Dr Nazirudin stressed the im­por­tance of es­tab­lish­ing the safety and ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“We trust that our reg­u­la­tory bod­ies and eth­i­cal bod­ies re­spon­si­ble to en­sure the safety of vac­cines have done their due dili­gence and job, and sub­jected the vac­cines to very rig­or­ous and strin­gent stan­dards of safety,” he said.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Singapore (Muis) had is­sued an irsyad, or re­li­gious guid­ance, urg­ing Mus­lims to be vac­ci­nated once a Covid-19 vaccine is avail­able, and med­i­cally au­tho­rised as safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said in a Face­book post that he wel­comed Muis’ re­li­gious guid­ance, and strongly en­cour­aged Mus­lims to be vac­ci­nated once the vac­cines are avail­able in Singapore.</p>
