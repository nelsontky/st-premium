    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia will en­ter 2021 with its big­gest spend­ing plan yet to spur its virus-hit econ­omy, but con­cerns are fo­cus­ing on how to foot the bill af­ter a sov­er­eign-rat­ing down­grade ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment ex­pects rev­enue to rise 4.2 per cent next year, count­ing on higher tax col­lec­tions – with­out rais­ing taxes or in­tro­duc­ing new ones – cou­pled with a move to slash its de­pen­dence on oil.</p>
    <p>The plan hinges on one key as­sump­tion: That tax in­come will rise as eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity re­turns close to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>“If the econ­omy does not re­cover as strongly as the 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent that the gov­ern­ment is ex­pect­ing, any rev­enue short­fall is likely to man­i­fest” in lower tax rev­enue, said Mr Wel­lian Wi­ranto, an econ­o­mist at OCBC Bank in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It is a big gam­ble. Fi­nance Min­is­ter Zafrul Ab­dul Aziz said last month that this year’s eco­nomic per­for­mance will be closer to mi­nus 5.5 per cent than the 4.5 per cent con­trac­tion pre­vi­ously ex­pected.</p>
    <p>That was af­ter tak­ing into ac­count re­newed move­ment curbs, ex­pected to cost the econ­omy RM300 mil­lion (S$99 mil­lion) a day, amid a fresh wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions that emerged in late Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Even with the pan­demic still rag­ing, the gov­ern­ment re­laxed re­stric­tions this month to give the econ­omy some breath­ing room.</p>
    <p>Daily virus cases hit a record high of 2,234 on Dec 10, and sev­eral ma­jor glove mak­ers – in­clud­ing Top Glove, the world’s largest – halted pro­duc­tion lines as in­fec­tions spread among staff.</p>
    <p>“There are speed bumps on the road to re­cov­ery,” May­bank an­a­lysts wrote in a mid-De­cem­ber re­search note.</p>
    <p>The new­est virus wave is more se­vere, and there may be a “scar­ring ef­fect” on the econ­omy that has been masked or de­layed by re­lief mea­sures that were ex­tended into next year, they wrote.</p>
    <p>The bank ex­pects Malaysia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct to grow 5.1 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>Ag­gra­vat­ing the prob­lem is the fact that Malaysia has few rev­enue sources to draw on.</p>
    <p>Since abol­ish­ing an un­pop­u­lar goods and ser­vices tax in 2018, the coun­try has de­pended on oi­land-gas rev­enue and div­i­dends, largely from state en­ergy com­pany Petronas, to fill its cof­fers.</p>
    <p>That back­fired when crude prices plunged this year, con­tribut­ing to a 14 per cent de­cline in gov­ern­ment rev­enue for 2020.</p>
    <p>Given sub­dued oil prices, cou­pled with ma­jor economies’ grad­ual shift to­wards green en­ergy, petroleum’s con­tri­bu­tion to gov­ern­ment rev­enue is set to de­cline, said econ­o­mist Fir­daos Rosli of Malaysia Rat­ing Corp, a do­mes­tic credit-rat­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment ur­gently needs to ex­pand its rev­enue base, as ex­pen­di­ture is slated to rise to fund eco­nomic re­cov­ery ef­forts,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment would be at a loss to in­crease its cof­fers if it doesn’t cap­i­talise on tax­ing con­sump­tion.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia is study­ing var­i­ous con­sump­tion tax mod­els to gauge their ef­fects on the econ­omy and liv­ing costs, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Zafrul said in a writ­ten re­ply to Par­lia­ment on Dec 15.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment will not make any such de­ci­sion dur­ing the pan­demic, and will wait un­til the econ­omy re­cov­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s bud­get plight is sound­ing alarm bells af­ter Fitch Rat­ings down­graded the sov­er­eign ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>S&P Global Rat­ings’ long-term rat­ing on Malaysia car­ries a neg­a­tive out­look, and could face down­ward pres­sure if the agency sees a weaker com­mit­ment to fis­cal con­sol­i­da­tion, said Mr An­drew Wood, a Sin­ga­pore-based an­a­lyst at S&P.</p>
