    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Brandt Snedeker, in the top 40 only once since the PGA Tour re­sumed in June fol­low­ing a three-month Covid-19 shut­down, said the long-awaited sight of fans helped him seize the lead in Thurs­day’s first round of the Houston Open.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old Amer­i­can fired a five-un­der 65 for a two-stroke edge at Memo­rial Park Golf Course, a mu­nic­i­pal lay­out host­ing a PGA event for the first time since 1963.</p>
    <p>“Very ex­cited about how I played,” he said. “Drove it great. Around this golf course, you have to be in the fair­way, oth­er­wise it’s go­ing to be a long day.</p>
    <p>“Did a great job of that. Made some putts. Birdied ev­ery par-five out there. You need to take ad­van­tage of the scor­ing holes, which I did a great job of to­day.”</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 2,000 spec­ta­tors are be­ing al­lowed each day with masks and so­cial-dis­tanc­ing pre­cau­tions in place.</p>
    <p>This is the first PGA event with spec­ta­tors on a US course since June – last week’s Ber­muda Cham­pi­onship also had a restricted gallery but it was held on the Caribbean is­land – and Snedeker was gal­vanised by their pres­ence.</p>
    <p>“That’s a big rea­son why I played well to­day – I love hav­ing fans out here,” he said. “I kind of feed off their en­ergy. It’s great to hear some claps and peo­ple ex­cited for good shots.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralians Ja­son Day and Cameron Davis, Mex­ico’s Car­los Or­tiz and Amer­i­cans Scot­tie Sch­ef­fler, Michael Thomp­son and Harold Varner shared sec­ond on 67, while nine play­ers re­mained on the course when dark­ness halted play.</p>
    <p>“I putted a lot bet­ter to­day than I had in the past,” for­mer world No. 1 Day said. “I think it’s just a good step in the right di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>World No. 84 Snedeker, whose only top-40 fin­ish since Fe­bru­ary was a share of 17th last month at</p>
    <p>Jackson, Mis­sis­sippi, is seek­ing a 10th ca­reer PGA Tour ti­tle and first since 2018 at Greens­boro, where he opened with a 59.</p>
    <p>“Did a great job of kind of think­ing my way around the golf course,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­cited I got a low one in me, which is good. The lead means noth­ing right now. We have a lot of golf to go.”</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Dustin John­son, in his first event since he con­tracted Covid-19, forc­ing him to miss two tour­na­ments last month, stum­bled to four bo­geys in five holes on his way to an open­ing 72.</p>
    <p>Four-time Ma­jor win­ner Brooks Koepka, try­ing to find form af­ter hip and knee in­juries, also shot 72.</p>
