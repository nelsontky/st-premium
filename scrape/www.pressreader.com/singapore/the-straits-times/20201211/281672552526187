    <p>The news of the pro­posed merger be­tween Golden Vil­lage and Cathay, the largest and third-largest cin­ema chains in Sin­ga­pore, is a sign of the strong com­pe­ti­tion from stream­ing ser­vices, ex­perts tell The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The move comes after rev­enue losses suf­fered by both chains due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, which closed cin­e­mas from March 27 and hob­bled their re­open­ing on July 13 with seat­ing re­stric­tions due to so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Golden Vil­lage Mul­ti­plex runs 14 cin­e­mas here. Me­dia com­pany mm2 Asia man­ages Cathay Cine­plexes, which operates eight cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>Un­der cur­rent num­bers, this would make the com­bined busi­ness a ti­tan with 22 cin­e­mas, dwarf­ing Shaw The­atres, the next largest player with nine cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>The chains stated in the fil­ing that they hope a merger will bring in more in­vestors and cre­ate economies of scale.</p>
    <p>Mr Thomas Chia, di­rec­tor of in­de­pen­dent dis­trib­u­tor Light­house Film Distributi­on, be­lieves film fans in Sin­ga­pore will ben­e­fit from the merger.</p>
    <p>It sig­nals that tra­di­tional cin­e­mas re­main ag­ile and are will­ing to take bold steps to keep con­sumers loyal, he said.</p>
    <p>“I just hope they will con­tinue to sup­port a va­ri­ety of films, big and small. A wider va­ri­ety will at­tract a wider group of film­go­ers.”</p>
    <p>Cin­ema op­er­a­tors are also hurt­ing from the lack of ma­jor re­leases, which have been post­poned to next year be­cause of lock­downs in the United States and else­where.</p>
    <p>Another blow to the cin­ema in­dus­try came last week when Warner Bros, the stu­dio be­hind the up­com­ing Won­der Woman 1984, an­nounced that the su­per­hero movie, along with its en­tire 2021 slate of films, will be re­leased on the HBO Max stream­ing ser­vice at the same time as in US the­atres.</p>
    <p>Up­com­ing Warner ti­tles in­clude the science-fic­tion block­busters Ma­trix 4 and Dune.</p>
    <p>Film dis­trib­u­tor Warner Bros Sin­ga­pore de­clined com­ment when ap­proached by ST.</p>
    <p>The move fol­lows Dis­ney’s de­ci­sion to re­lease the pe­riod fan­tasy Mu­lan on its Dis­ney + stream­ing plat­form in the US in Septem­ber, an ex­per­i­ment that could pave the way for more stream­ing re­leases of its ma­jor films.</p>
    <p>Mu­lan was re­leased in cin­e­mas here in Septem­ber. Won­der Woman 1984 will be re­leased in cin­e­mas here on Dec 17.</p>
    <p>It has not yet been an­nounced when HBO Max will be avail­able in Sin­ga­pore. The Dis­ney + ser­vice is ex­pected to roll out world­wide over the next two years, ac­cord­ing to re­ports.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try pro­fes­sion­als told ST that cin­ema chains are brac­ing them­selves for the fall­out when these ser­vices do be­come avail­able here, which could see Dis­ney’s Star Wars fran­chise and films from the Mar­vel Cin­e­matic Uni­verse make their way to the Dis­ney + ser­vice shortly after open­ing in cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>Mar­vel’s Avengers: Endgame (2019) smashed sev­eral box of­fice records, in­clud­ing for open­ing week­end ($7.52 mil­lion) and cu­mu­la­tive to­tal ($19.5 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Film fan Wayne Heng, 29, a fi­nance ex­ec­u­tive, said that if the merger happens, he hopes “the cin­e­mas pass the sav­ings from the economies of scale on to peo­ple like us”.</p>
    <p>For him, watch­ing movies is a so­cial ac­tiv­ity to be shared with his wife and friends. “I en­joy the cin­ema ex­pe­ri­ence, which I can’t get from stream­ing.”</p>
    <p>The pro­posed merger has to be ap­proved by share­hold­ers of both com­pa­nies as well as gov­ern­ment agen­cies, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Golden Vil­lage chief ex­ec­u­tive Clara Cheo said in a state­ment: “Cin­ema op­er­a­tors are fac­ing tough times to­day amid the ad­vent of on­line stream­ing apps, the growth of so­cial me­dia video con­tent and the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We need to adapt in or­der to suc­ceed and GV, be­ing a lead­ing cin­ema ex­hibitor with sev­eral firsts in the lo­cal movie in­dus­try, is con­fi­dent that the pro­posed merger will en­able us to pro­vide con­tin­ual ac­cess to a wider range of of­fer­ings for our con­sumers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chang Long Jong, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of mm2 Asia, said in a state­ment: “In a world where con­sumer de­mands are con­stantly evolv­ing, en­ter­tain­ment in terms of con­tent and distributi­on must, too, evolve to bet­ter serve the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, he noted that the com­pany’s films have done well in terms of box of­fice tak­ings and awards.</p>
    <p>“Cin­e­mas must evolve be­yond be­ing con­tent dis­trib­u­tors to bring­ing the best en­ter­tain­ment ex­pe­ri­ence to our con­sumers,” he said. “This merger will bet­ter help us to achieve this.”</p>
