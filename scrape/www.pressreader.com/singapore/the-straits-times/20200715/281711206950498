    <p>JULY 7</p>
    <p>Four stu­dents and a school teacher are among 20 newly con­firmed com­mu­nity cases, says the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>One of the stu­dents, a 13-year-old boy, is from Jurong West Sec­ondary School.</p>
    <p>All four stu­dents are linked to house­hold in­fec­tions and were on home quar­an­tine or­ders be­fore they were later swabbed as close con­tacts of their house­hold mem­bers.</p>
    <p>JULY 10</p>
    <p>The MOH an­nounces that a Sec­ondary 1 fe­male stu­dent from Jurong West Sec­ondary School who had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus is linked to the 13-year-old boy.</p>
    <p>Since she was a close con­tact of the boy, she had been serv­ing an MOH home quar­an­tine or­der since July 6.</p>
    <p>July 14</p>
    <p>Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal says “hu­man er­ror” in its lab­o­ra­tory led to a false di­ag­no­sis, and sub­se­quent re-tests found that the fe­male stu­dent did not have the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The mis­take came about when two pa­tients had their spec­i­mens cross-la­belled.</p>
    <p>The MOH, which was in­formed of the er­ror on July 13, said the mis­la­belled pos­i­tive sam­ple be­longs to a mi­grant worker who had been iso­lated since his swab, and had not been in con­tact with any­one else.</p>
    <p>He has since been ad­mit­ted to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases and re­mains in a sta­ble con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, all 71 stu­dents and staff mem­bers who were the close con­tacts of the first case at Jurong West Sec­ondary School have also tested neg­a­tive.</p>
