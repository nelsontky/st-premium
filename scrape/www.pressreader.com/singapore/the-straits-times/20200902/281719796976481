    <p>Or­chard Cen­tral and Bugis Junc­tion were among the places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>At least one pa­tient vis­ited Da Long Yi Hot Pot res­tau­rant in Or­chard Cen­tral, while Xiao Long Kan Hot­pot res­tau­rant and Star­bucks in Bugis Junc­tion were each also vis­ited by at least one pa­tient, it said.</p>
    <p>Also added to the list of places pa­tro­n­ised by in­fec­tious pa­tients were Don Dae Bak Res­tau­rant at 35 Kreta Ayer Road, the McDon­ald’s out­let at Pasir Ris Sports Com­plex and Mei Heong Yuen Dessert at Tem­ple Street.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients were present for at least 30 min­utes so that peo­ple who were in those places at the same time can mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit. The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Forty new Covid-19 cases were con­firmed yes­ter­day. Among them were seven im­ported cases, in­clud­ing a one-year-old from In­dia.</p>
    <p>The in­fant, a short-term visit pass holder, was asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The six other im­ported cases in­cluded pa­tients who had ar­rived sep­a­rately from Bangladesh, In­dia, Brazil and the United States.</p>
    <p>All were placed on 14-day stay­home no­tices upon their ar­rival in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and tested while serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There was one case in the com­mu­nity – a work pass holder who was de­tected through ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors.</p>
    <p>MOH said close con­tacts of the pa­tient, a 24-year-old wo­man from China, have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 32 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,852.</p>
    <p>Of the 32, 22 had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and were al­ready in quar­an­tine to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. The other 10 pa­tients in dor­mi­to­ries were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, which in­cludes bi-weekly ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries and test­ing of those with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from two cases two weeks ago to three in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble, at an av­er­age of one per day over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 91 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 55,734 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 86 pa­tients re­mained in hospi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 990 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
