    <p>Ac­tress Hi­lary Swank says she is ex­tremely picky when it comes to roles and had stepped back from act­ing to care for her ail­ing fa­ther af­ter he had a lung trans­plant in 2014. The 46-year-old now stars in the new Net­flix space drama Away, where she plays the cap­tain of the first manned mis­sion to Mars.</p>
    <p>Hi­lary Swank has not ex­actly done a ton of films since she won two Os­cars for Best Ac­tress – for play­ing a trans­gen­der man in the biopic Boys Don’t Cry (1999) and a boxer in the sports drama Mil­lion Dol­lar Baby (2004).</p>
    <p>The 46-year-old says it is be­cause she is ex­tremely picky when it comes to roles and also be­cause she stepped back from act­ing to care for her ail­ing fa­ther af­ter he had a lung trans­plant in 2014.</p>
    <p>But she has been pop­ping up on screen a bit more in re­cent years and now stars in the new Net­flix space drama Away, where she plays the cap­tain of the first manned mis­sion to Mars.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times from her home i n Los An­ge­les re­cently, she says it takes a lot for her to say yes to a project at this stage of her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“The thing is that now, life is so full, so I have to love and be in­spired by the story and char­ac­ters so much, and have it en­rich my life in some way in or­der to take all that time out.”</p>
    <p>With Away, it was the fact that it is not just a space ad­ven­ture but a char­ac­ter drama that fully em­braces the in­ter­na­tional na­ture of its crew – five astro­nauts from the United States, Rus­sia, In­dia, China and Bri­tain/ Ghana – that she found ap­peal­ing.</p>
    <p>“We have these multi-eth­nic char­ac­ters from all walks of life, but we’re all con­nected by this de­sire to live to our fullest pur­pose and to give and re­ceive love,” she says.</p>
    <p>There are many sub­ti­tled scenes where the astro­nauts speak in their na­tive lan­guages and Swank says the cre­ators never once con­sid­ered wa­ter­ing down that el­e­ment of the show to make it more palat­able to the Amer­i­can au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>“And it just adds a level of depth be­cause all the peo­ple watch­ing who speak those lan­guages or who are from those coun­tries are go­ing to feel in­cluded, rather than see­ing their peo­ple from an English­s­peak­ing point of view.”</p>
    <p>And it re­flects the truth of how space agen­cies such as Nasa (the US’ Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion) work. “When you go into space, there are no bor­ders and peo­ple are free to be who they are and are work­ing to­wards a com­mon goal, which is beau­ti­ful.”</p>
    <p>The show also spends con­sid­er­able time on the per­sonal dra­mas of each as­tro­naut.</p>
    <p>For Swank’s char­ac­ter, Emma, much of this is about the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to leave her hus­band and teenage daugh­ter be­hind for the three-year jour­ney.</p>
    <p>That and other calls she makes will chal­lenge the no­tion that a woman should al­ways put fam­ily be­fore ca­reer – a dou­ble stan­dard that Swank is all too fa­mil­iar with.</p>
    <p>“When some jour­nal­ists vis­ited the set, a young woman who worked for a women’s mag­a­zine told me that af­ter she watched the pi­lot, ‘I was flab­ber­gasted your char­ac­ter made that choice. But then, I checked my­self be­cause I re­alised had you been a man, I would’ve never ques­tioned it.’</p>
    <p>“And that was so in­ter­est­ing – how these sys­temic ideas of how we see gen­der, which are based on the sto­ries we’re told, be­come our be­liefs. So I love how this is mak­ing peo­ple think about that,” Swank says.</p>
    <p>She has also found her­self torn be­tween fam­ily and ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been an ac­tor now for 29 years and when my dad needed a lung trans­plant, I was the only per­son who could help him through that be­cause I had the abil­ity to take time off work and be there.</p>
    <p>“And so I took what was sup­posed to be a year off to help my dad and it quickly be­came two, and then three, as he was re­ally fight­ing for his life,” says Swank, who is mar­ried to en­tre­pre­neur Philip Sch­nei­der, 45.</p>
    <p>This is some­thing view­ers will be able to re­late to even if their jobs do not in­volve outer space, she adds.</p>
    <p>“Those are the de­ci­sions peo­ple have to make now be­cause their lives are so full with their dreams and as­pi­ra­tions, which can also in­clude fam­ily, of course,” she says. “So you’re con­stantly find­ing that bal­ance be­tween fam­ily and work.”</p>
    <p>Away is avail­able on Net­flix.</p>
