    <p>The Repub­lic’s Olympic-bound ath­letes be­lieve a coro­n­avirus vac­cine will be a shot in the arm for the suc­cess­ful stag­ing of next year’s Tokyo Games, and are ready to take one should it be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will be rep­re­sented in div­ing, gym­nas­tics, sail­ing, shooting, swim­ming and ta­ble ten­nis, while na­tional shut­tlers Loh Kean Yew and Yeo Jia Min and fencer Amita Berthier re­main in the hunt for an Olympic spot. Diver Jonathan Chan, who is set to make his Olympic de­but, said: “If there is a vac­cine, I’ll def­i­nitely feel safer, and it’s good to know that the or­gan­is­ers are try­ing to do all they can to keep par­tic­i­pants safe.”</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old is an ar­chi­tec­ture ma­jor at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign (SUTD) and will have to bal­ance school and train­ing in the lead up to next year’s July 23-Aug 8 Games.</p>
    <p>World No. 9 pad­dler Feng Tian­wei, a three-time Olympic medal­list and vet­eran of more than 10 ma­jor Games, shared that vac­cines have been par for the course as a pre­cau­tion for re­gion-spe­cific dis­eases such as the Zika virus in Brazil dur­ing the 2016 Olympics.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old re­turned to com­pet­i­tive ac­tion at the Nov 8-10 In­ter­na­tional Ta­ble Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion (ITTF) Women’s World Cup in Wei­hai, China where she suf­fered a shock early exit and is com­pet­ing in this week’s ITTF Fi­nals. She added: “If there is an ef­fec­tive vac­cine, it only makes sense for us to take it for our own health, safety and peace of mind.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this week’s trip to Tokyo, In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee pres­i­dent Thomas Bach said he is “en­cour­ag­ing” all Olympic par­tic­i­pants and fans to be vac­ci­nated even if it will not be com­pul­sory.</p>
    <p>“We want to con­vince as many for­eign par­tic­i­pants as pos­si­ble to ac­cept a vac­cine,” the 66-year-old Ger­man said on Mon­day, as he ex­pressed confidence that the post­poned Games will open on July 23.</p>
    <p>Moderna had re­vealed on Mon­day that its ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine was 94.5 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19, based on in­terim data from a late-stage clin­i­cal trial.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Pfizer’s vac­cine also re­ported an ef­fec­tive­ness of more than 90 per cent, and pend­ing more safety data and reg­u­la­tory re­view, the United States could have two vac­cines autho­rised for emer­gency use next month, with as many as 60 mil­lion doses of vac­cine avail­able by the year’s end.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Sin­ga­pore Shooting As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Michael Vaz urged cau­tion and will wait for ad­vice from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) and Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Health (MOH) be­fore com­mit­ting his ath­letes to the post­poned Olympic Games.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore have se­cured one spot in the women’s 10m air ri­fle but are aim­ing to add places in the 50m ri­fle three po­si­tions, 25m pis­tol and 10m air pis­tol via the In­ter­na­tional Shooting Sport Fed­er­a­tion World Cup events in Delhi and Chang­won, South Korea next March and April re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Vaz said: “I’m also a par­ent, and our No. 1 con­cern is the health and safety of our ath­letes. We won’t force our shoot­ers to go for any over­seas events in this case, and there are no obli­ga­tions or penal­ties if they do not wish to go.</p>
    <p>“It is up to them and their par­ents to de­cide, and we will de­pend on WHO and MOH to guide us.</p>
    <p>“I’m not a doc­tor and I do not know whether a re­li­able vac­cine will be out in time for the Olympics. I hope so, and I also hope for ef­fec­tive treat­ment so that at least peo­ple can be as­sured they can re­cover from the virus even if they get it.”</p>
    <p>If there is a vac­cine, I’ll def­i­nitely feel safer, and it’s good to know that the or­gan­is­ers are try­ing to do all they can to keep par­tic­i­pants ’’ safe. JONATHAN CHAN, Sin­ga­pore diver, giv­ing the thumbs up to a vac­cine.</p>
