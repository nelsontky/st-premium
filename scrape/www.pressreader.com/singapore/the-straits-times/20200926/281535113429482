    <p>The po­lice are ac­tively trawl­ing the In­ter­net for web­sites of­fer­ing vice or un­li­censed money-lend­ing ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore, in a bid to ar­rest the grow­ing prob­lem of loan sharks and on­line vice. A ten­der for such a trawl­ing ser­vice was awarded to StarHub on July 29, with the ser­vice due to be de­liv­ered last month.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are ac­tively trawl­ing the In­ter­net for web­sites of­fer­ing vice or un­li­censed money-lend­ing ser­vices here, in a bid to ar­rest the grow­ing prob­lem of loan sharks and on­line vice.</p>
    <p>Ten­der doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times (ST) show the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF) had re­quested a ser­vice to “con­duct proac­tive trawl­ing of the In­ter­net for vice-re­lated and un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing re­lated web­sites” and rank them ac­cord­ing to traf­fic vol­ume.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice should also be able to mon­i­tor monthly ac­cess to such sites via mo­bile or non-mo­bile chan­nels and track the num­ber of vice work­ers ad­ver­tised on each site.</p>
    <p>The ten­der was awarded to StarHub on July 29, with the ser­vice due to be de­liv­ered last month.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from ST, the po­lice said the trial ini­tia­tive is to “see how tech­nol­ogy can be bet­ter lever­aged to im­prove SPF’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties in de­tect­ing such web­sites”.</p>
    <p>“Once de­tected, SPF will con­tinue to work with the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties to take ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tions against th­ese web­sites.”</p>
    <p>The ser­vice comes as on­line vice and loan-shark­ing ac­tiv­i­ties have spiked in re­cent years. Un­li­censed money-lend­ing cases hit a five-year high last year, up by some 33 per cent from the year be­fore to 751. In 2018, 55 per cent of women ar­rested for vice were in­volved with on­line syn­di­cates, up from 16 per cent in 2015.</p>
    <p>The use of such a proac­tive “trawl­ing ser­vice” is not new, said ex­perts. Mr Ash Ang, di­rec­tor of IT con­sul­tancy firm Ima­genz, said other firms that use such ser­vices, which in the in­dus­try is re­ferred to as “web crawl­ing”, in­clude those that want to track their com­peti­tors’ prices on e-com­merce stores.</p>
    <p>Law en­force­ment agen­cies i n other coun­tries also em­ploy sim­i­lar tech­nol­ogy. In Malaysia, a po­lice unit mon­i­tors the traf­fic at porno­graphic web­sites, es­pe­cially those that of­fer child porn, and can lo­cate in real time users surf­ing them.</p>
    <p>How­ever, users here need not fear they will be pun­ished for ac­cess­ing un­li­censed money-lend­ing or vice web­sites, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Kian Kim, head of cy­ber se­cu­rity, pri­vacy and data pro­tec­tion at law firm Harry Elias Part­ner­ship who goes by the ini­tials K.K., said vis­it­ing such web­sites is not il­le­gal, as they are open to the pub­lic. But he added that there are sec­toral rules gov­ern­ing the op­er­a­tion of such sites in Sin­ga­pore, cit­ing the Moneylen­ders Act that reg­u­lates money-lend­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in ap­proved places of busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The Women’s Char­ter was also amended last year to ex­tend pow­ers to en­snare syn­di­cates op­er­at­ing on­line vice sites from over­seas.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim fur­ther noted that shut­ting down any site out­side of Sin­ga­pore can be a “long and te­dious task”. He said “there are many laws in other coun­tries that do not al­low you to shut down sites for a va­ri­ety of rea­sons, in­clud­ing ex­er­cis­ing their con­sti­tu­tion­ally pro­tected rights”, adding that hosts may even mount a le­gal chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>“Shut­ting them down may not be so sim­ple,” said Mr Lim.</p>
