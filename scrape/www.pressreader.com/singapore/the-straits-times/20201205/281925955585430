    <p>Pro­fes­sor Zhang Yongzhen broke ground when he pub­lished the first com­plete genome of Sars-CoV-2 in Jan­uary, which al­lowed health au­thor­i­ties around the world to recog­nise the mys­te­ri­ous pathogen that would soon be­gin to cause may­hem beyond China’s shores.</p>
    <p>It was a choice he made at some per­sonal risk, con­sid­er­ing the po­lit­i­cal sen­si­tiv­ity of in­for­ma­tion sur­round­ing the coro­n­avirus at the time.</p>
    <p>Prof Zhang, 55, who is at the Shang­hai Pub­lic Health Clin­i­cal Cen­tre, has been lauded for his brav­ery and pro­fes­sion­al­ism by the in­ter­na­tional me­dia, and was in­cluded as one of Time’s 100 most in­flu­en­tial peo­ple of this year.</p>
    <p>His de­ci­sion to pub­lish t he genome map helped save count­less lives by re­duc­ing the time it takes to get a di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>Prof Zhang told Time news mag­a­zine that he up­loaded the se­quence to the United States Na­tional Cen­tre for Biotech­nol­ogy In­for­ma­tion on Jan 5 – the same day he and his team had com­pleted the se­quenc­ing af­ter work­ing non­stop for about 40 hours.</p>
    <p>But the cen­tre can take “days or even weeks” to look at a sub­mis­sion, Time said.</p>
    <p>So Prof Zhang de­cided in­stead to pub­lish the re­sults on­line on Jan 11, through Pro­fes­sor Ed­ward Holmes, a col­league at the Univer­sity of Sydney, be­cause of the gravity of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he ob­tained the genome, Prof Zhang noted that the virus that causes Covid-19 re­sem­bled the Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) virus, which killed 774 peo­ple world­wide in 2003.</p>
    <p>He told Time: “I had two sug­ges­tions (to top pub­lic health of­fi­cials): that we should take some emer­gency pub­lic mea­sures to pro­tect against this dis­ease; also, clin­ics should de­velop an­tivi­ral treat­ments.”</p>
    <p>He told a col­league that SarsCoV-2 was cer­tainly more dan­ger­ous than avian flu H5N1.</p>
    <p>Prof Zhang, a top sci­en­tist, and his team have dis­cov­ered more than 2,000 viruses in some 10 years, ac­cord­ing to Shang­hai Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy News.</p>
    <p>Prof Zhang, who was ed­u­cated at the South China Agri­cul­tural Univer­sity, South­ern Med­i­cal Univer­sity and Kun­ming In­sti­tute of Zo­ol­ogy, is well known for his hard work. He did not go home to see his fam­ily thou­sands of miles away for the three years that he was do­ing his doc­tor­ate in Kun­ming, the Chi­nese news out­let said.</p>
    <p>He also worked through week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days, and for­went his an­nual leave.</p>
    <p>He was back at work a week af­ter un­der­go­ing an eight-hour surgery for thy­roid ade­noma in 2009.</p>
