    <p>Sin­ga­pore shares fell in tan­dem with sev­eral re­gional mar­kets af­ter what some called a “train wreck” US pres­i­den­tial de­bate yes­ter­day morn­ing (Sin­ga­pore time), with the Straits Times In­dex (STI) down 4.99 points or 0.2 per cent to 2,466.62.</p>
    <p>About 1.5 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $1.37 bil­lion changed hands, with losers just slightly out­num­ber­ing gain­ers 200 to 198.</p>
    <p>The worst per­form­ers on the in­dex were Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust, which fell 3 per cent to $1.93, and Cap­i­taLand Com­mercial Trust, which fell 3 per cent to $1.64.</p>
    <p>This came af­ter both sets of unit hold­ers voted re­sound­ingly in favour of the pro­posed merger on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>RHB Re­search an­a­lyst Vi­jay Natara­jan said this could be due to in­vestors who are not keen on the merged en­tity sell­ing it since the deal is passed now. “Prob­a­bly they don’t want ex­po­sure to the merged en­tity, and now that the vot­ing has cleared the hur­dle for the merger and it is most likely cer­tain to hap­pen, it could have prompted some funds to sell.”</p>
    <p>Con­versely, Kep­pel Corp was the best per­former on the in­dex, adding 3.5 per cent to $4.45, as an­a­lysts kept “buy” rat­ings on the counter fol­low­ing its clear com­mu­ni­ca­tion of its plans.</p>
    <p>CGS-CIMB also added that a di­vest­ment of its off­shore and ma­rine (O&M) unit above its book value at the end of its first half of $1.77 bil­lion could be a fur­ther cat­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>The most ac­tive counter was once again Sem­b­corp Ma­rine for the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive day, as its units rose 1.4 per cent to $0.146, on a tremen­dous vol­ume of 214.6 mil­lion shares traded.</p>
    <p>This was as in­vestors be­came in­creas­ingly op­ti­mistic about a po­ten­tial merger with Kep­pel’s O&M di­vi­sion, given a clear over­ca­pac­ity and in­cen­tive for both ship­yards to con­sol­i­date their op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Across the re­gion, mar­kets were some­what mixed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex added 0.79 per cent as traders wel­comed pos­i­tive fac­tory data in­di­cat­ing China’s econ­omy con­tin­ues to re­cover from a pan­demic-in­duced slow­down. The Shang­hai Com­pos­ite in­dex fell 0.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s bench­mark Nikkei 225 in­dex fell 1.50 per cent, while Malaysia’s KLCI added 0.06 per cent. Aus­tralia’s S&P/ASX 200 in­dex ended 2.3 per cent lower, snap­ping a five-month win­ning streak.</p>
    <p>“The US elec­tions, and to­day’s de­bate, is adding an ex­tra level to an al­ready un­cer­tain mar­ket,” said Mr Brad Smol­ing, man­ag­ing direc­tor at Smol­ing Stock­brock­ing.</p>
