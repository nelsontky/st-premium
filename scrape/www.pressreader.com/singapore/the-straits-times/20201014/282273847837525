    <p>•</p>
    <p>SHANG­HAI Chi­nese do­mes­tic equities are worth more than US$10 tril­lion (S$13.6 tril­lion) for the first time since 2015, when a record crash erased half the mar­ket’s value in months and sad­dled mil­lions of in­vestors with losses.</p>
    <p>The world’s sec­ond-largest stock mar­ket has added US$3.3 tril­lion since a low in March, helped by Bei­jing’s poli­cies to en­cour­age trad­ing, a flurry of new list­ings that ar­rived with eased rules, and the strength­en­ing ren­minbi.</p>
    <p>Stocks have been close to the US$10 tril­lion mile­stone since July, when China’s gov­ern­ment acted to tame a spec­u­la­tive rally that had sud­denly pushed a gauge of large caps near a 12-year high.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s to­tal mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion is now US$10.04 tril­lion and just shy of the all-time high, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg as of Mon­day. The United States has the world’s most valu­able stock mar­ket at US$38.3 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>“It’s a mean­ing­ful num­ber, es­pe­cially com­ing af­ter a pause in the stock rally,” said Mr Hao Hong, chief strate­gist for Bo­com In­ter­na­tional in Hong Kong. “It’s pos­si­ble China’s mar­ket value can ex­pand faster now that mar­ket re­forms like the reg­is­tra­tion-based ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing sys­tem are in place.”</p>
    <p>Chi­nese shares ral­lied af­ter a long hol­i­day break on op­ti­mism the gov­ern­ment will in­tro­duce re­forms to turn the re­gion around Shen­zhen into a global tech­nol­ogy hub and that the rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party will in­tro­duce poli­cies to stim­u­late de­mand when it holds a ma­jor meet­ing later this month. Equities surged over the sum­mer as mar­gin debt climbed at the fastest pace since 2015 and turnover soared.</p>
    <p>The CSI 300 In­dex of key stocks listed in Shang­hai and Shen­zhen slipped 0.2 per cent as of 10.17am yesterday, par­ing its gain this year to 17 per cent. That rally tops the world’s ma­jor bench­marks.</p>
    <p>China has added a new stock venue since 2015, with the Nas­daqstyle Star Mar­ket launch­ing in Shang­hai in July last year. Reg­u­la­tors waived rules on val­u­a­tions and de­but-day price lim­its for shares on the board. In Au­gust, a batch of 18 firms traded for the first time on the ChiNext In­dex un­der so-called reg­is­tra­tion-based ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings, surg­ing by an av­er­age 212 per cent by the close.</p>
    <p>A stronger ren­minbi has also helped equities. China’s cur­rency rose 3.9 per cent last quar­ter, the most in 12 years.</p>
    <p>That ad­vance has prompted the cen­tral bank to re­strain the ren­minbi’s rally while stop­ping short of en­cour­ag­ing de­clines.</p>
