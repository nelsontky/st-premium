    <p>•</p>
    <p>MUM­BAI In­dia is set to swing from be­ing a cau­tious spender this year to open­ing the fis­cal flood­gates as Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi seeks to pull Asia’s third-big­gest econ­omy – after China and Ja­pan – back from the worst of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Curbs im­posed by the Fi­nance Min­istry on more than 80 govern­ment de­part­ments and min­istries ear­lier in the year to pre­serve cash were re­laxed this quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, this year’s bud­get will be increased from its cur­rent 30 tril­lion ru­pees (S$543 bil­lion) when new spend­ing plans are announced on Feb 1, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple familiar with dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ments will give a boost to much-needed spend­ing to help weather the hit from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment ex­pen­di­tures have barely hit the half­way mark seven months into the fis­cal year, which started in April.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy en­tered an un­prece­dented re­ces­sion last quar­ter after lock­downs brought eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity to a near stand­still in the April-June pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to bud­get spend­ing, Mr Modi’s govern­ment has announced mea­sures that it said are worth an ad­di­tional 30 tril­lion ru­pees, or 15 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP), to res­cue busi­nesses and jobs.</p>
    <p>That pack­age, how­ever, un­der­whelmed some econ­o­mists who saw the ac­tual fis­cal cost of the steps, which were mostly loan guar­an­tees, at less than 2 per cent of GDP. This com­pares with di­rect spend­ing of roughly 3 per cent of GDP on av­er­age in other emerg­ing mar­kets, ac­cord­ing to S&P Global Rat­ings.</p>
    <p>On top of that, the ab­sence of pri­vate in­vest­ment added to ur­gency for the govern­ment to ramp up spend­ing, which was just 55 per cent of the bud­geted amount as of Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>“More spend­ing is ac­tu­ally re­quired. And the more the de­lay in extra spend­ing, the big­ger will be the chal­lenge,” said econ­o­mist Ku­nal Kundu with So­ci­ete Gen­erale Global So­lu­tion Cen­tre in Ben­galuru. He cau­tioned, how­ever, that a large in­crease will be dif­fi­cult with­out help from the cen­tral bank, given the short­fall in re­ceipts from taxes and as­set sales.</p>
    <p>The threat of a credit rat­ing down­grade to junk dis­cour­aged of­fi­cials from de­liv­er­ing a more im­me­di­ate boost to the econ­omy through di­rect cash hand­outs to cit­i­zens or tax cuts.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s net govern­ment debt will rise to more than 90 per cent of GDP this year from a lit­tle over 70 per cent last year, ac­cord­ing to S&P Global Rat­ings, and its com­bined fis­cal deficit will be in dou­ble dig­its this year – fac­tors that have put the na­tion on the path for a rat­ing cut.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Nir­mala Sithara­man said in an in­ter­view this month that she would not let wor­ries about a fis­cal deficit stop her from spend­ing more. “There is a need, and a clear need, for me to spend the money,” she said.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral govern­ment’s bud­get gap will prob­a­bly widen to 8 per cent of GDP this year, ac­cord­ing to a Bloomberg sur­vey. That will be more than dou­ble the tar­geted 3.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment ex­panded its mar­ket bor­row­ing plan this year to an un­prece­dented 13.1 tril­lion ru­pees from its planned 7.8 tril­lion ru­pees.</p>
    <p>High-fre­quency in­di­ca­tors show that a re­cov­ery is tak­ing hold, with the cen­tral bank see­ing the na­tion ex­it­ing a re­ces­sion in the cur­rent quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The Re­serve Bank of In­dia also this month re­vised its full-year growth out­look to a milder 7.5 per cent con­trac­tion, com­pared with its Oc­to­ber es­ti­mate for a 9.5 per cent de­cline.</p>
