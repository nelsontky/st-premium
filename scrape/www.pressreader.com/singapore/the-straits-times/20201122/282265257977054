    <p>WHERE Re­sorts World Sen­tosa, 8 Sen­tosa Gate­way</p>
    <p>AD­MIS­SION Prices start at $23 for chil­dren aged four to 12 and se­niors aged 60 and above; $28 for youth aged 13 to 17; and $32 for adults INFO www.rwsen­tosa.com/en/ at­trac­tions/sea-aquar­ium</p>
    <p>THE LOW­DOWN</p>
    <p>The S.E.A. Aquar­ium has been around since 2012, but if you have not been there in a while, you will find a few new ex­pe­ri­ences to en­joy. The re­cently ex­panded aquar­ium fea­tures three new habi­tats – Rain­for­est, In­ter­tidal and Coral Reef.</p>
    <p>In the cir­cuit breaker months when the aquar­ium was closed, its hus­bandry pro­gramme saw the birth of sev­eral new an­i­mals, in­clud­ing the brightly coloured poi­son ar­row frogs and epaulette sharks.</p>
    <p>Take a break from walk­ing and rest in the new im­mer­sive sit­ting area which mim­ics the un­der­wa­ter en­vi­ron­ment of a ship­wreck.</p>
    <p>FUN FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>We have the most fun at the new Dis­cov­ery Pool. Un­der the guid­ance of aquar­ium staff, my kids glee­fully han­dle the knob­bly sea star, which we learn is na­tive to Sin­ga­pore wa­ters. It re­minds us of Pa­trick from SpongeBob SquarePant­s. We pre­tend that the tiger cowrie, a type of sea snail, is Gary, an­other car­toon char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING VALUE</p>
    <p>There is plenty of knowl­edge to pick up about dif­fer­ent un­der­wa­ter habi­tats as well as con­ser­va­tion ef­forts for en­dan­gered species. The walls at the aquar­ium now fea­ture more in­fo­graph­ics with eas­ily di­gestible fun facts about the 100,000 marine an­i­mals housed there rep­re­sent­ing more than 1,000 species.</p>
    <p>At the new coral prop­a­ga­tion habi­tat, my kids learn that en­tire coral colonies can grow from tiny coral frag­ments.</p>
    <p>ROOM FOR IM­PROVE­MENT</p>
    <p>To en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing, we have to queue to get up close to most of the ex­hibits. We spend about five min­utes on av­er­age in most queues, which is tol­er­a­ble, but the wait is longer at pop­u­lar ex­hibits such as the Open Ocean habi­tat.</p>
    <p>We are dis­ap­pointed that the baby epaulette sharks have not been added to the Dis­cov­ery Pool.</p>
    <p>INSIDER TIPS</p>
    <p>You can get free swag through the Christ­mas-themed SEAASON of Redis­cov­ery pro­mo­tions. Get the chil­dren to pay at­ten­tion to fac­toids dis­played around the ex­hibits. Then look out for the Gift Of Knowl­edge quiz booths where they have to iden­tify the crea­tures through rid­dles. Get all five an­swers cor­rect to score a tote bag. Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents get a free face mask with the one-day ticket.</p>
    <p>WILL WE BE BACK?</p>
    <p>Yes, but we will avoid the week­end crowds. The ad­di­tion of the baby epaulette sharks is rea­son enough to re­turn.</p>
