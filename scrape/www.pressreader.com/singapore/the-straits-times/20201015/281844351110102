    <p>Con­tin­ued diplo­matic ties be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hun­gary for 50 years now have been un­der­pinned by “mu­tual re­spect”, ac­cord­ing to Hun­gar­ian For­eign Min­is­ter Peter Sz­i­j­jarto, who noted there has been a prac­ti­cal side to the co­op­er­a­tion as well in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We rep­re­sent a sim­i­lar kind of ap­proach when it comes to pa­tri­o­tism, when it comes to the ap­proach to the na­tion it­self,” said Mr Sz­i­j­jarto, who was on a one-day visit to Sin­ga­pore as part of a trip to South-East Asian coun­tries, in­clud­ing the Philip­pines and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Mr Sz­i­j­jarto was hosted to lunch by Min­is­ter for For­eign Af­fairs Vi­vian Balakrishn­an, dur­ing which the two sides reaf­firmed the warm and friendly ties be­tween both coun­tries, ac­cord­ing to a Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs press state­ment.</p>
    <p>The duo also wel­comed the sign­ing of a Me­moran­dum of Un­der­stand­ing be­tween Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and the Hun­gar­ian Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs and Trade last month on the Stipendium Hun­gar­icum schol­ar­ship, of­fered by Hun­gary for Sin­ga­pore­ans to pur­sue stud­ies in Hun­gary, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The for­eign min­is­ters dis­cussed ways to broaden and deepen bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion in eco­nom­ics, agri­trade and in­vest­ment, as well as peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, notwith­stand­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>Mr Sz­i­j­jarto also met Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing and the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board’s Of­fice for Space Tech­nol­ogy and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post about his meet­ing with Mr Sz­i­j­jarto, Mr Chan wrote: “We ex­changed views on global and re­gional de­vel­op­ments, and reaf­firmed the good bi­lat­eral eco­nomic re­la­tions that Sin­ga­pore and Hun­gary share.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Sin­ga­pore and Hun­gary are ex­cel­lent launch pads for busi­nesses look­ing to ac­cess op­por­tu­ni­ties in our re­spec­tive re­gions – South-east Asia and Cen­tral and Eastern Europe. There is plenty of room for our re­la­tions to grow, and I be­lieve that by work­ing to­gether, there is much we can do to en­sure a strong post-pan­demic eco­nomic re­cov­ery. We also ex­pressed our sup­port for up­hold­ing the open and rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>When it came to the econ­omy, Mr Sz­i­j­jarto said there were four ma­jor fields where mu­tual co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hun­gary could bring ma­jor ben­e­fits. These were the food and agri­cul­ture, space, de­fence and au­to­mo­tive in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Sz­i­j­jarto high­lighted Hun­gary as the first Euro­pean Union mem­ber state to rat­ify an EU-Sin­ga­pore agree­ment on pro­tect­ing in­vest­ments in each other’s ju­ris­dic­tions and ex­pressed hope that other EU states would also rat­ify it so that the pact could come into force.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rat­ing on the mi­grant cri­sis in the EU in re­cent years – which has seen Hun­gary tak­ing flak from Brus­sels over its re­fusal to ac­com­mo­date any of the mi­grants – Mr Sz­i­j­jarto sounded a hard line.</p>
    <p>“We im­ple­ment a very strong anti-mi­grant pol­icy. We be­lieve it is our own na­tional right to keep the coun­try as it is – to keep it a Hun­gar­ian coun­try, a coun­try of the Hun­gar­i­ans... And no­body, no in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tion is en­ti­tled to take this right away from us – nei­ther from Brus­sels, nor from New York,” the min­is­ter said, not­ing that nei­ther Hun­gary nor Sin­ga­pore was a sig­na­tory to the Global Com­pact for Mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Both Hun­gary and Poland have re­sisted a pro­posal from Brus­sels for each EU mem­ber to ac­com­mo­date a quota of the mi­grants who have made their way to the fron­tiers of the bloc from coun­tries such as Syria and Afghanista­n.</p>
