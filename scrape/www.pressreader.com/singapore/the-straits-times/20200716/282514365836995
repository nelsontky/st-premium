    <p>Based on the Chi­nese leg­end of the moon god­dess, the an­i­mated film Over The Moon will be re­leased on Net­flix later this year and screened in theatres in China.</p>
    <p>It is the story of a girl who builds a rocket ship to fly her to the moon so she can meet the god­dess Chang E .</p>
    <p>In a re­cent Zoom press con­fer­ence, voice ac­tors San­dra Oh and John Cho are asked what it means to them to do a movie so rooted in Asian cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Oh, the Emmy-win­ning ac­tress from the spy thriller Killing Eve (2018 to present), says: “It’s sig­nif­i­cant and won­der­ful. On this Zoom screen right now, what every­one is see­ing is pre­dom­i­nantly Asian faces and that’s what’s ex­cit­ing to me.”</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old Korean Amer­i­can, who is the voice of the girl’s step­mother-to-be, adds: “It’s ex­cit­ing for me to be able to even talk to other (Asian) ac­tors that were in the same film; for me and maybe John (Cho), we’ve been the only ones ev­ery­where we go.”</p>
    <p>Another heart­en­ing de­vel­op­ment for Asian per­form­ers in Hol­ly­wood: “The roles we are tak­ing on and are of­fered are ac­tu­ally very cul­tur­ally spe­cific.”</p>
    <p>Cho, who is also Korean Amer­i­can, says he is al­ways drawn to projects grounded in Asian cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“But it’s hard to find things that rep­re­sent Asian cul­ture, es­pe­cially fam­ily dy­nam­ics, as some­thing that’s not op­pres­sive or at­tached to shame, fil­ial piety or do­ing things that you don’t want to do,” says the 48-year-old Star Trek (2009) ac­tor, who plays the girl’s fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“And this story is about an Asian fam­ily that is rooted in love.”</p>
    <p>The film’s di­rec­tor, an­i­ma­tion leg­end Glen Keane, says he and his cre­ative team trav­elled to China so they could make the movie as cul­tur­ally au­then­tic as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>One of the spots they vis­ited was Wuzhen, a scenic canal town in Zhe­jiang prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“It’s this won­der­ful wa­ter town, a mini Venice, and it’s where the story takes place. We walked around and learnt what the real China is like.</p>
    <p>“I had ideas in my head but they were all wrong un­til I was there,” says the 66-year-old, who was the lead an­i­ma­tor for many iconic char­ac­ters in Dis­ney f i l ms , in­clud­ing Ariel in The Lit­tle Mer­maid (1989) and the ti­tle char­ac­ters in Poc­a­hon­tas (1995) and Aladdin (1992).</p>
    <p>“At one point, I said ‘I wish we could go in­side a house’ and our guide goes up to one, knocks on the door and says, ‘We have some vis­i­tors here from Hol­ly­wood, would you mind if they came in and looked around?’</p>
    <p>“The door opens and there’s a group of el­derly folk play­ing mahjong. I got my sketch­book and started draw­ing and they were so open and free. And we dis­cov­ered how life was all about the din­ner ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “That be­came the tent­pole of our movie from be­gin­ning to end.”</p>
