    <p>A police staff sergeant con­tacted a woman linked to a case in­volv­ing shop theft and lied to her that her com­pany had con­tacted the police about the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>They met and Ma­hen­dran Sel­vara­joo, who worked at Cle­menti Police Di­vi­sion, drove her to a car park and told her he would help her.</p>
    <p>He then asked her to per­form a sex act on him. She com­plied, fear­ing she could lose her job.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly he promised an­other woman, linked to a sep­a­rate case of al­leged credit card fraud, that he would help her. She, too, com­plied and they had sex while they were at an­other car park. Both in­ci­dents took place last year .</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day Ma­hen­dran, 32, was sen­tenced to two years’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to two counts of cor­rup­tion and two counts of of­fences un­der the Com­puter Mis­use Act.</p>
    <p>The two women can­not be named owing to a gag or­der from a dis­trict court.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier state­ment, the police said Ma­hen­dran has been sus­pended since May 15 last year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a dis­trict court heard that he was the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer (IO) of the shop theft case and that on Dec 21, 2017, the first woman had been given a stern warn­ing in lieu of pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>But Ma­hen­dran con­tacted her on Feb 26 last year, and they met the fol­low­ing day. They went to a multi-storey carpark in Block 590, Ang Mo Kio Street 51 where the woman per­formed a sex act on him.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the court heard he was the ini­tial IO of the al­leged credit card fraud case, but it was later re­ferred to an­other police di­vi­sion. Still, he con­tacted the sec­ond woman on April 29 last year and asked to view her lap­top when they met that evening, and saw some nude pic­tures of her.</p>
    <p>He took it home and copied six fold­ers with her per­sonal pho­tographs and videos to his per­sonal por­ta­ble stor­age de­vice.</p>
    <p>The pair met again shortly af­ter mid­night, and he told her that he could help her with the case. Fear­ing pros­e­cu­tion, she agreed to have sex with him while they were at a multi-storey carpark in Block 264, Seran­goon Cen­tral.</p>
    <p>Ma­hen­dran tar­geted a third woman last year when he was the IO of an­other credit card case. Af­ter tak­ing her state­ment in May, he asked for her lap­top and mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>She told him there were sex­u­ally ex­plicit videos of her and her boyfriend on the phone.</p>
    <p>Ma­hen­dran left his work­place later with the de­vices and copied the videos to his per­sonal stick USB flash drive.</p>
    <p>But the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau had al­ready been alerted to his ac­tiv­i­ties on May 1 last year, and ar­rested him the same day.</p>
