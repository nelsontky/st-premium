    <p>BANGKOK • One stu­dent’s sign at the protest read, “No god, no kings, only man”. An­other’s said, “You have awak­ened a sleep­ing gi­ant”.</p>
    <p>Those pro­test­ers were among the more than 10,000 peo­ple who on Sun­day at­tended an hours-long rally at Bangkok’s Democ­racy Mon­u­ment – which was built to com­mem­o­rate the end of ab­so­lute monar­chy in Thai­land in 1932.</p>
    <p>A 19-year-old stu­dent at Ramkhamhae­ng Univer­sity, who goes by the nick­name Joy, was hold­ing up a hand­writ­ten mes­sage, “Give us back democ­racy”.</p>
    <p>“We have no choice but to come out,” she said. “This gov­ern­ment has got to go.”</p>
    <p>The gath­er­ing was the largest, and bold­est, protest yet since a mil­i­tary junta over­threw the last demo­crat­i­cally elected gov­ern­ment in Thai­land in 2014.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents like Joy want change: They want a mil­i­tary sub­or­di­nate to elected of­fi­cials, a monar­chy sub­or­di­nate to the Con­sti­tu­tion and a new Con­sti­tu­tion that would pro­tect ma­jor­ity rule.</p>
    <p>By way of pointed rap songs, Hunger Games salutes and Harry Pot­ter memes, on univer­sity cam­puses or in the streets, pro­test­ers have been call­ing for the gov­ern­ment’s res­ig­na­tion and sys­temic demo­cratic re­form.</p>
    <p>Such de­mands may seem rea­son­able, but they are re­mark­able in Thai­land, given the risks of speak­ing out, es­pe­cially against the monar­chy: The lese ma­jeste law car­ries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison, and the junta that seized power in 2014 – and is thought to have then ma­nip­u­lated the gen­eral elec­tion last year to keep power with a ve­neer of le­git­i­macy – has used other laws, like the cy­ber­crimes Act, to squelch dis­sent.</p>
    <p>This mo­ment is un­like any in re­cent Thai his­tory. A new gen­er­a­tion of ac­tivists has moved from ex­press­ing coded crit­i­cism of the monar­chy to pub­licly call­ing for whole­sale re­form.</p>
    <p>And this surge of plain-talk ac­tivism is stir­ring dread and warn­ings – maybe even threats? – of an­other crack­down: Thai se­cu­rity forces killed pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers in 1973, 1976, 1992 and 2010.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it was in­evitable that the end of King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej’s 70-year reign in 2016 would mean a re­vi­sion of the po­lit­i­cal or­der of his days – in which the palace, the army, the bu­reau­cracy and the courts claimed to have a veto on po­lit­i­cal author­ity, never mind pop­u­lar will.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the twi­light of King Bhu­mi­bol’s rule, con­flicts re­curred be­tween es­tab­lish­ment forces and ma­jori­tar­ian rep­re­sen­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers elected busi­ness­man Thaksin Shi­nawa­tra prime min­is­ter in 2001; he was ousted by the mil­i­tary in 2006. Thaksin’s sis­ter Yingluck was elected in 2011. Her gov­ern­ment was de­posed in 2014 in a coup led by re­tired gen­eral Prayut Chan-o-cha, who is the prime min­is­ter to­day.</p>
    <p>The gen­er­als or their prox­ies en­acted in 2017 a Con­sti­tu­tion that ce­mented elite rule. The prime min­is­ter does not need to be an elected mem­ber of Par­lia­ment (and Mr Prayut is not). The se­nate is ap­pointed, not elected, and it has been filled with cronies hand­picked by the junta. The ju­di­ciary has been em­pow­ered to dis­ci­pline politi­cians.</p>
    <p>Since suc­ceed­ing his fa­ther,</p>
    <p>King Bhu­mi­bol, King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, who spends most of his time in Ger­many, has asked that the lat­est Con­sti­tu­tion be amended to fa­cil­i­tate his reign­ing from abroad, and he has taken di­rect con­trol of the royal fam­ily’s vast as­sets, as well as com­mand over the Bangkok-based army units that were in­stru­men­tal in car­ry­ing out coups in the past.</p>
    <p>The junta, for its part, ex­tended its rule by hold­ing an elec­tion in March last year – mak­ing sure to come out on top of that, thanks partly to the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of some can­di­dates and the reap­por­tion­ment of seats after the vot­ing.</p>
    <p>The fledg­ling Fu­ture For­ward Party posed a new chal­lenge to the tra­di­tional elites then, by run­ning on a plat­form ad­vo­cat­ing the break­ing up of mo­nop­o­lies, de­cen­tral­is­ing power and re­mov­ing the mil­i­tary from pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>It placed third in the pop­u­lar vote count, win­ning 6.2 mil­lion of the 36.2 mil­lion bal­lots cast, many of those from first-time vot­ers.</p>
    <p>But ear­lier this year, the Con­sti­tu­tional Court dis­solved Fu­ture For­ward on le­gal grounds that human rights groups have called du­bi­ous; the party’s lead­ers face crim­i­nal charges that could send them to prison for years.</p>
    <p>The rise and dis­so­lu­tion of the party helped politi­cise a new gen­er­a­tion raised on Face­book, Twit­ter and South Korean pop mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Anti-gov­ern­ment protests started gain­ing mo­men­tum ear­lier this year. Lockdown mea­sures to deal with the coro­n­avirus put a damper on the protests, but with the coun­try’s com­par­a­tively good per­for­mance on that front, and the lift­ing of re­stric­tions since early last month, pro­test­ers have re­turned in force, with ma­jor griev­ances and sweep­ing de­mands.</p>
    <p>One plac­ard at the protest in Bangkok on Sun­day read: “It’s so bad even in­tro­verts are here.”</p>
    <p>Younger pro­test­ers de­cry Thai­land’s stul­ti­fy­ing eco­nomic and so­cial hi­er­ar­chy; they want an end to what some call “feu­dal­ism”. They de­nounce the dou­ble stan­dards of a sys­tem that cod­dles the well-off and well-con­nected.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, a woman in her late 50s seated by the bar­rier sep­a­rat­ing the crowd from the stage set up for speak­ers said: “Why are these gen­er­als so rich? All they do is cheat. They should be in prison.”</p>
    <p>The ex­treme con­cen­tra­tion of po­lit­i­cal power has also led to an ex­treme con­cen­tra­tion of wealth.</p>
    <p>Atop Thai­land’s oli­garchic pyra­mid sits the Crown Prop­erty Bu­reau, which man­ages the royal fam­ily’s prop­er­ties and in­vest­ments – a for­tune es­ti­mated at be­tween US$50 bil­lion (S$68 bil­lion) and US$60 bil­lion, and since mid-2018, un­der the King’s di­rect over­sight.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a report by Credit Suisse, 1 per cent in Thai­land owned 50.4 per cent of the coun­try’s to­tal wealth last year.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the pan­demic, in­comes had been stag­nat­ing, and poverty, debt and in­equal­ity were ris­ing. Then in late May, the gov­ern­ment’s plan­ning unit es­ti­mated that up to 14.4 mil­lion peo­ple – in a coun­try of about 69 mil­lion – could be out of work by the end of the year, mainly be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 500,000 stu­dents who will grad­u­ate from univer­sity this year face the worst job mar­ket in decades. Gov­ern­ment fig­ures re­leased on Mon­day show that Thai­land’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct for the sec­ond quar­ter of this year dropped by 12.2 per cent year on year, the coun­try’s worst per­for­mance since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 1997 to 1998.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple now de­mand­ing needed change face real risks. Gov­ern­ment crit­ics are rou­tinely ha­rassed and in­tim­i­dated. Dis­si­dents in ex­ile have dis­ap­peared, been ab­ducted or mur­dered.</p>
    <p>Both sup­port­ers and crit­ics of the cur­rent protests cite a pos­si­ble re­play of the mas­sacre of Oct 6, 1976, in which se­cu­rity forces and right-wing paramil­i­taries shot, lynched and killed scores of pro-democ­racy stu­dent pro­test­ers at Tham­masat Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Then, as in re­cent times, the mil­i­tary lead­er­ship said that ac­tivists were com­mu­nists. The army chief has said they are peo­ple who “hate their na­tion” and are a disease worse than Covid-19.</p>
    <p>At this point, only mas­sive re­pres­sion could put a lid on the de­mands for re­form aired in re­cent weeks. On the other hand, blood­shed would most likely be self-de­feat­ing for the au­thor­i­ties. Back in 1976, the Oct 6 mas­sacre spurred thou­sands of stu­dents to join the com­mu­nist rebels in the jun­gle.</p>
    <p>Most stu­dents to­day are not call­ing for the monar­chy’s abo­li­tion so much as for the au­thor­i­ties’ ac­count­abil­ity un­der the law.</p>
    <p>The roy­al­ists are re­spond­ing with strained ar­gu­ments – about fi­delity to a sup­pos­edly im­mutable Thai cul­ture, about the karmic merit of power, about the young need­ing to know their place.</p>
    <p>Their fail­ure to quell dis­sent could al­low the long­stand­ing taboo against crit­i­cis­ing the monar­chy to be shat­tered al­to­gether. But re­pres­sion would only fur­ther un­der­mine the le­git­i­macy of the ex­ist­ing or­der.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, short of real po­lit­i­cal re­form, the ide­o­log­i­cal po­tency of roy­al­ism in Thai­land can only be un­der­mined, per­haps ir­re­versibly.</p>
