    <p>As tem­per­a­tures rise, Sin­ga­pore is look­ing at how it can make its out­door en­vi­ron­ment cooler – and it is start­ing this quest in the vir­tual world. A “dig­i­tal twin” of Sin­ga­pore is be­ing built un­der the Cool­ing Sin­ga­pore project, a na­tional re­search ini­tia­tive funded by the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>As tem­per­a­tures rise, Sin­ga­pore is look­ing at how it can make its out­door en­vi­ron­ment cooler – and it is start­ing this quest in the vir­tual world.</p>
    <p>A “dig­i­tal twin” of Sin­ga­pore is be­ing built un­der the Cool­ing Sin­ga­pore project, a na­tional re­search ini­tia­tive funded by the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF).</p>
    <p>This model will al­low re­searchers and pol­i­cy­mak­ers to find out the var­i­ous fac­tors that af­fect out­door tem­per­a­tures – be they traf­fic flow, the type of land sur­face or the prox­im­ity of a wa­ter body.</p>
    <p>They can also use the model to see how new strate­gies can be used to make be­ing out­doors more com­fort­able for peo­ple.</p>
    <p>This “dig­i­tal twin” of Sin­ga­pore is not un­like the sim­u­la­tions in pop­u­lar city-build­ing video game SimCity. Ex­cept that in “SingCity”, real-life pa­ram­e­ters are used.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, data on Sin­ga­pore’s build­ings, traf­fic, veg­e­ta­tion and land sur­faces will be in­cor­po­rated.</p>
    <p>Re­gional- and mi­cro-scale cli­mate fac­tors, such as the di­rec­tion and amount of wind a par­tic­u­lar area re­ceives, or the rel­a­tive hu­mid­ity there, will also be in­putted into the model, dubbed the Dig­i­tal Ur­ban Cli­mate Twin, or Duct.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ger­hard Schmitt, lead prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor of the Cool­ing Sin­ga­pore project, told The Straits Times that Duct will let ur­ban plan­ners and pol­i­cy­mak­ers gen­er­ate dif­fer­ent sce­nar­ios to un­der­stand how land use plans will af­fect ur­ban heat and out­door ther­mal com­fort.</p>
    <p>The ur­ban heat is­land ef­fect hap­pens when build­ings, roads and ve­hi­cles re­lease heat into the en­vi­ron­ment, es­pe­cially at night. Stud­ies have shown that this phe­nom­e­non has re­sulted in tem­per­a­ture dif­fer­ences of up to 7 deg C be­tween ur­ban and less built-up ar­eas here.</p>
    <p>Prof Schmitt, who is from re­search in­sti­tute Sin­ga­pore-ETH Cen­tre, said the re­search team, which is led by nine prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tors, is also plan­ning so­cial sci­ence re­search stud­ies.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “An ex­am­ple is to pro­duce is­land­wide vul­ner­a­bil­ity maps of Sin­ga­pore to iden­tify lo­ca­tions that most ur­gently need in­ter­ven­tion, such as ar­eas with high tem­per­a­tures where more young chil­dren or el­derly peo­ple live.”</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond phase of the Cool­ing Sin­ga­pore project and will span three years.</p>
    <p>An ear­lier phase of the project, which be­gan in 2017 and has since con­cluded, ex­am­ined sci­en­tific lit­er­a­ture and case stud­ies around the world to come up with a menu of 86 strate­gies to cool the city, from in­cor­po­rat­ing wa­ter bod­ies into the city to us­ing paint that can re­flect the sun’s heat.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures aim to make the Repub­lic cooler through de­sign and the use of in­no­va­tive ma­te­ri­als, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Win­ston Chow, a Cool­ing Sin­ga­pore project prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor, said cool­ing strate­gies that can be im­ple­mented at new sites will dif­fer from those in ex­ist­ing es­tates, which may need more retrofitti­ng.</p>
    <p>“Some so­lu­tions that could work at ex­ist­ing es­tates could in­clude, for ex­am­ple, hav­ing larger park spa­ces, green roofs and green walls, or hav­ing bet­ter tech­nol­ogy, such as so­lar ther­mal hy­brid air­con­di­tion­ers, to re­duce waste heat in­puts into the ur­ban cli­mate,” said Prof Chow.</p>
    <p>At the na­tional level, elec­tric ve­hi­cles, more ef­fi­cient cool­ing tech­nol­ogy or changes in hu­man be­hav­iour could also have an im­pact.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, peo­ple be­ing more con­scious of how ur­ban waste heat is gen­er­ated could lead to less use of petrol-pow­ered cars or air-con­di­tion­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>An NRF spokesman said the ur­ban heat is­land ef­fect is ex­pected to worsen with global warm­ing. This could have long-term im­pli­ca­tions on pub­lic health, air and wa­ter qual­ity, as well as gen­eral live­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Higher tem­per­a­tures also en­cour­age the use of air-con­di­tion­ing, which could, in turn, drive up tem­per­a­tures even fur­ther due to in­creased emis­sions, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“Tack­ling the ur­ban heat is­land ef­fect is a key as­pect of Sin­ga­pore’s over­ar­ch­ing cli­mate adap­ta­tion and re­silience plan,” she said.</p>
    <p>NRF also said the project could pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore. Due to its mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary na­ture, ex­per­tise in mul­ti­ple re­search ar­eas – such as cli­ma­tol­ogy, com­puter sci­ence and en­vi­ron­men­tal en­gi­neer­ing – will be re­quired, pro­vid­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for as­pir­ing and es­tab­lished sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>And as cli­mate change is a global prob­lem, so­lu­tions de­vel­oped here could also be ex­ported.</p>
    <p>“It is vi­tal that we con­tinue to in­vest in such re­search ef­forts to de­velop mit­i­ga­tion and adap­ta­tion mea­sures that can be ap­pli­ca­ble in Sin­ga­pore and around the world,” said the NRF spokesman.</p>
