    </section>

    <p>Wong be­came an ac­tivist in his early teens, suc­cess­fully get­ting Hong Kong to drop a pro-China na­tional ed­u­ca­tion pro­gramme by ral­ly­ing a crowd of 120,000 to block­ade the city’s Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>In 2014, he helped spear­head the Um­brella Move­ment protests with fel­low stu­dent lead­ers. He has been hailed as one of the world’s most in­flu­en­tial fig­ures by Time, For­tune and For­eign Pol­icy mag­a­zines, and was the sub­ject of Net­flix doc­u­men­tary Joshua: Teenager Vs Su­per­power.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing last year’s protests, Wong met politi­cians in Europe and the United States, and called for sanc­tions against China. This in­fu­ri­ated Bei­jing and a new na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed by China out­laws push­ing for greater au­ton­omy for Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Shortly be­fore the law passed, Wong dis­banded his po­lit­i­cal party De­mo­sisto.</p>
    <p>AGNES CHOW, 23</p>
    <p>Chow hails from the same gen­er­a­tion of Hong Kong democ­racy ac­tivists who cut their teeth in politics as teenagers.</p>
    <p>She has de­scribed grow­ing up in an apo­lit­i­cal Catholic house­hold. But at the age of 15, she joined the youth-led move­ment protest­ing against plans to im­ple­ment na­tional ed­u­ca­tion in pub­lic schools.</p>
    <p>She be­came a major fig­ure of the Um­brella Move­ment and co-founded De­mo­sisto. By 2018, she was one of the first De­mo­sisto politi­cians barred from stand­ing for lo­cal elec­tions as the party ad­vo­cated “self-de­ter­mi­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>Chow was also one of the first op­po­si­tion politi­cians to be ar­rested un­der Bei­jing’s new se­cu­rity law – on a charge of “col­lud­ing with for­eign forces” – and faces life in jail if pros­e­cuted and con­victed.</p>
    <p>IVAN LAM, 26</p>
    <p>Born to a po­lice­man father, Lam went to the same sec­ondary school as Wong and helped start the campaign against pa­tri­otic ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>He has been con­victed four times for pro-democ­racy protests or ral­lies. He was in­stru­men­tal in set­ting up De­mo­sisto and later served as its chair­man un­til the group was dis­banded ear­lier this year.</p>
