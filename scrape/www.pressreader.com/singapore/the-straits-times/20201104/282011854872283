    <p>•</p>
    <p>Late in the af­ter­noon on a re­cent week­day, work­ers at an aqua­cul­ture farm near Shang­hai used long pin­cers to move 300g crabs from muddy ponds into small pools of fresh­wa­ter. By morn­ing, the crabs – their shells cleansed of dirt – will be packed into gift boxes and shipped to cus­tomers all over China.</p>
    <p>These are no or­di­nary crus­taceans: They are hairy crabs, a del­i­cacy that can cost as much as 2,700 yuan (S$550) for a box of eight and can be pur­chased for only a few weeks in au­tumn. Prices for some of the most pop­u­lar crabs have dou­bled com­pared with a year ago.</p>
    <p>Even as China’s eco­nomic growth slows amid Covid-19, the pan­demic has been good for farm owner Ma Mingjun’s busi­ness. In nor­mal years, many Chi­nese give hairy crabs as gifts to spe­cial rel­a­tives, im­por­tant cus­tomers or gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, but now bigspend­ing con­sumers who have not been able to shop in Paris or Mi­lan are treat­ing them­selves to more home-grown lux­u­ries.</p>
    <p>“Al­most all the hairy crabs in our pools have been re­served, much faster than last year,” Mr Ma said. “To off­set the frus­tra­tion of travel re­stric­tions, many cus­tomers are buy­ing big­ger crabs to share with their fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>De­mand for hairy crabs in China was about 120 bil­lion yuan last year and is ex­pected to reach 150 bil­lion yuan this year, ac­cord­ing to con­sul­tancy AskCI Con­sult­ing. The bestseller this year costs 1,600 yuan per box, up from 800 yuan last year.</p>
    <p>The sea­sonal del­i­cacy is one of many pricey items gain­ing in pop­u­lar­ity. LVMH and Ker­ing re­ported mid-dou­ble-digit sales growth in China for the sec­ond quar­ter, while duty-free stores in the south­ern prov­ince of Hainan recorded a 167 per cent jump in sales dur­ing the week-long Oc­to­ber na­tional hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese travel stores – the type seen in air­ports and train sta­tions – posted strong growth for Estee Lauder in the com­pany’s most re­cent quar­ter, chief ex­ec­u­tive Fabrizio Freda said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>That is in part be­cause travel</p>
    <p>bans and quar­an­tine re­quire­ments have forced the peo­ple of China to choose lo­cal des­ti­na­tions, said Ms Xu Ruyi, head of re­ports for North Asia at Lon­don-based con­sul­tancy Min­tel Group.</p>
    <p>“Many wealthy Chi­nese who used to ‘buy buy buy’ over­seas are spend­ing do­mes­ti­cally,” said Ms Xu. “High-in­come con­sumers are more re­silient amid eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties and more will­ing to spend on some­thing that can bring them plea­sure in com­pen­sa­tion for the hard year.”</p>
    <p>It is not just the pan­demic help­ing de­mand for hairy crabs. East­ern China is a ma­jor pro­duc­tion hub, and for many years most of the sup­ply stayed in the Shang­hai area. Con­sumers else­where of­ten had dif­fi­culty get­ting them.</p>
    <p>Now, with the ex­pan­sion of lo­gis­tics op­er­a­tions to ser­vice e-com­merce op­er­a­tions like Alibaba Group and JD.com, farm­ers can more eas­ily send crabs long dis­tance. Cainiao, the lo­gis­tics sub­sidiary of Alibaba, can de­liver fresh crabs to do­mes­tic buy­ers within two days of re­ceiv­ing or­ders, and con­sumers in Sin­ga­pore this year can get de­liv­er­ies of crabs pur­chased on Alibaba’s Taobao plat­form.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to con­cerns about seafood safety, farm­ers are also us­ing livestream­ing to re­as­sure con­sumers of the clean­li­ness of their fa­cil­i­ties. In­flu­encers are do­ing on-lo­ca­tion ap­pear­ances and of­fer­ing dis­counts.</p>
    <p>Back at his farm near Shang­hai,</p>
    <p>Mr Ma ex­pects his crabs to reach their peak flavour early this month. “We’ll work all night till dawn,” he said. “Ev­ery­one de­serves some­thing nice in this dif­fi­cult year.”</p>
