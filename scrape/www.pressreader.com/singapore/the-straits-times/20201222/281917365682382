    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers chal­lenged both the use of the emer­gency law and the ban on wear­ing masks at per­mit­ted ral­lies. They ar­gued that the move breached Hong Kong’s mini-Con­sti­tu­tion, the Ba­sic Law... But yes­ter­day, a panel of top judges unan­i­mously backed the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion to use a colo­nial-era emer­gency law to ban face masks at protests last year was both pro­por­tion­ate and le­gal, the city’s top court ruled yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing is a blow for democ­racy sup­port­ers who had been hop­ing the Court of Fi­nal Ap­peal would side with a lower court and over­turn the order. It also con­firms that Hong Kong’s chief ex­ec­u­tive – a pro-Bei­jing ap­pointee – has the power to en­act any law in a time of pub­lic emer­gency with­out need­ing the ap­proval of the city’s par­tially elected leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>But its prac­ti­cal con­se­quences were un­clear, given that the gov­ern­ment has made masks com­pul­sory in pub­lic ar­eas to com­bat the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong was con­vulsed by seven straight months of huge and of­ten vi­o­lent pro-democ­racy protests last year. They were even­tu­ally quashed by mass ar­rests, a coro­n­avirus-re­lated ban on pub­lic gath­er­ings and Bei­jing im­pos­ing a new na­tional se­cu­rity law on the city in June this year.</p>
    <p>Face masks be­came ubiq­ui­tous to re­duce the risk of iden­ti­fi­ca­tion and pros­e­cu­tion for those tak­ing part in peace­ful marches, or vi­o­lent clashes with po­lice.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber last year, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam banned any­one cov­er­ing their face at pub­lic ral­lies, us­ing the Emer­gency Reg­u­la­tions Or­di­nance (ERO).</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers chal­lenged both the use of the emer­gency law and the ban on wear­ing masks at per­mit­ted ral­lies.</p>
    <p>They ar­gued that the move breached Hong Kong’s mini-Con­sti­tu­tion, the Ba­sic Law.</p>
    <p>A lower court had agreed with those bring­ing the chal­lenge and ex­pressed con­cerns about the emer­gency law and the pro­por­tion­al­ity of the mask ban.</p>
    <p>But yes­ter­day, a panel of top judges unan­i­mously backed the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“The am­bit of the power to make sub­sidiary leg­is­la­tion un­der the ERO in a sit­u­a­tion of emer­gency or in cir­cum­stances of pub­lic dan­ger, although wide and flex­i­ble, was not un­con­sti­tu­tional,” the judges ruled.</p>
    <p>Ban­ning face masks at both il­le­gal and le­gal ral­lies was pro­por­tion­ate be­cause it was aimed at “the pre­ven­tion and de­ter­rence of vi­o­lence be­fore a peace­ful pub­lic gath­er­ing had de­te­ri­o­rated into vi­o­lence”.</p>
