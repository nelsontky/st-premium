    <p>Ja­pan is set to im­pose a new state of emer­gency in Tokyo and its three neigh­bour­ing pre­fec­tures, with Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga say­ing yes­ter­day that “stronger mes­sag­ing” was needed to make peo­ple take the Covid-19 threat more se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>“Even with the surge in in­fec­tion num­bers, the num­ber of peo­ple go­ing out in the Greater Tokyo area did not re­ally de­crease at all in De­cem­ber,” he said at a New Year press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“An even stronger mes­sage must be sent to the peo­ple,” he added.</p>
    <p>“It is the sea­son of New Year gath­er­ings and par­ties, and I must re­it­er­ate the re­quest for peo­ple to avoid go­ing out for un­nec­es­sary pur­poses.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga said that spe­cific pol­icy de­tails and sched­ules were still be­ing worked out, but lo­cal me­dia cited sources as say­ing that the de­cree will take ef­fect by Satur­day and last for one month.</p>
    <p>The new emer­gency de­cree will be “more tar­geted and fo­cused” on high-risk ar­eas, Mr Suga said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added that his govern­ment will look at im­pos­ing re­stric­tions on food and bev­er­age (F&B) es­tab­lish­ments. He called for such eater­ies in the Greater Tokyo re­gion to close by 8pm – two hours ear­lier than the cur­rent 10pm guide­line.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Koichi Hag­iuda said yes­ter­day that schools will re­main open even in an emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The na­tional univer­sity en­trance exam will still be held as sched­uled later this month.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga also said the govern­ment was work­ing to­wards start­ing Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions by late next month. This is a re­vised time­line from the pre­vi­ously planned mid-March start.</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers, se­nior cit­i­zens and em­ploy­ees at el­derly wel­fare homes will be the first to get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>He also ad­mit­ted that restart­ing the Go To Travel do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign on Mon­day as planned – af­ter a two-week sus­pen­sion – was “dif­fi­cult”, given the surge in new coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The Greater Tokyo re­gion, com­pris­ing Tokyo, Kana­gawa, Saitama and Chiba, is one of the world’s most densely pop­u­lated metropoli­tan ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The likely state of emer­gency comes as there is con­stant movement of peo­ple around the four pre­fec­tures, whether for work, school or play.</p>
    <p>The four pre­fec­tures have col­lec­tively ac­counted for about half of Ja­pan’s daily Covid-19 caseload in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga said his govern­ment’s cur­rent pri­or­ity was to curb the spread of Covid-19 be­fore in­fec­tions reach a point of ex­plo­sive growth.</p>
    <p>While his ad­min­is­tra­tion has long hes­i­tated to call an­other emer­gency, its cal­cu­la­tions changed af­ter the Greater Tokyo area reg­is­tered a spike in cases on New Year’s Eve.</p>
    <p>All four pre­fec­tures hit new daily highs, led by Tokyo which recorded 1,337 new cases.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the cap­i­tal recorded 884 new in­fec­tions, while the num­ber of pa­tients in se­ri­ous con­di­tion hit an all-time high of 108.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nors of the four pre­fec­tures had asked the na­tional govern­ment to call a new state of emer­gency dur­ing a meet­ing on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga said tak­ing aim at F&B es­tab­lish­ments was an ef­fec­tive mea­sure.</p>
    <p>“Ex­perts have said that one of the most com­mon causes of in­fec­tion was due to droplets spread­ing dur­ing eat­ing and drink­ing, and thus it is most ef­fec­tive to cur­tail meet­ings at night and ask for co­op­er­a­tion in short­en­ing busi­ness hours.”</p>
    <p>The govern­ment will ta­ble a new law in the up­com­ing Par­lia­ment ses­sion to be­gin on Jan 18 to ef­fect pun­ish­ment on busi­nesses that refuse to com­ply.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 dom­i­nated the halfhour news con­fer­ence, even as Mr Suga also sought to high­light other pol­icy mea­sures, such as dig­i­tal re­forms, as his pri­or­i­ties for the year.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, an in­ter­nal Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) lead­er­ship elec­tion will de­ter­mine Mr Suga’s po­lit­i­cal for­tunes as LDP pres­i­dent and hence, prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The Lower House must also be dis­solved and a gen­eral elec­tion be called by Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>To this, Mr Suga said: “I am not at all look­ing so far ahead. I want to fin­ish one by one each of the chal­lenges that are in front of me (be­fore I strate­gise for the elec­tions).”</p>
    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga yes­ter­day in­sisted his govern­ment was still com­mit­ted to hold­ing the coro­n­avirus-post­poned Tokyo 2020 Olympics this sum­mer, say­ing the Games would not only be “proof that mankind over­came the virus” but de­liver “hope and courage” to the whole world.</p>
    <p>How­ever, au­thor­i­ties are set to de­clare a state of emer­gency in Tokyo and three ad­join­ing pre­fec­tures as in­fec­tions and the num­ber of peo­ple in se­ri­ous con­di­tion reach record lev­els.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal yes­ter­day re­ported al­most 900 new Covid-19 cases, while there are about 110 peo­ple with se­ri­ous symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The na­tion­wide weekly case to­tal has in­creased for 14 straight weeks, while the death toll in that pe­riod has in­creased 10 times.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic me­dia reports say the state of emer­gency could be de­clared as early as Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Should Ja­pan again is­sue a state of emer­gency – the first was de­clared in April – as re­quested by Tokyo and three neigh­bour­ing pre­fec­tures to com­bat the spike, it is bound to have a se­ri­ous im­pact on the Games.</p>
    <p>With 199 days to go, an­other such mea­sure would hin­der lo­cal ath­letes’ train­ing for the Olympics, due to start on July 23 fol­low­ing an un­prece­dented one-year de­lay, while reignit­ing the de­bate about whether they should be held at all.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has barred en­try from all coun­tries, ex­clud­ing Ja­panese na­tion­als and non-Ja­panese res­i­dents, un­til the end of the month, and spe­cial pro­ce­dures de­vel­oped to ex­pe­dite the safe en­try of over­sea ath­letes have been par­tially sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Last year’s state of emer­gency was lifted in Tokyo by the end of</p>
    <p>May. Un­til that time, Tokyo’s Na­tional Train­ing Cen­tre, a key com­po­nent of Ja­pan’s strat­egy to achieve Olympic suc­cess, was ef­fec­tively shut­tered.</p>
    <p>With less than seven months be­fore the Olympics, a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion would rep­re­sent a huge hur­dle to many ath­letes’ prepa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>En­thu­si­asm for the Games is also not build­ing, with re­cent polls still show­ing a ma­jor­ity of re­spon­dents favour­ing ei­ther an­other de­lay or an out­right can­cel­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens also ex­pressed their frus­tra­tion on so­cial me­dia over the tight­en­ing of Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures.</p>
    <p>One user, Mii Mama, tweeted: “This morn­ing the news said it’s 200 days till the Olympics, and in the af­ter­noon, that there could be an­other state of emer­gency. What’s go­ing on?”</p>
    <p>But de­spite the wors­en­ing cri­sis, In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee pres­i­dent Thomas Bach re­mains hope­ful Tokyo can get a han­dle on the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In his New Year’s mes­sage, he said: “We can only thank our Ja­panese part­ners and friends for their great com­mit­ment and their de­ter­mi­na­tion, which is ab­so­lutely in line with our com­mit­ment and our de­ter­mi­na­tion to or­gan­ise these Games in a safe and se­cure way for all the par­tic­i­pants and to make these Games fit for the post-coro­n­avirus world.”</p>
