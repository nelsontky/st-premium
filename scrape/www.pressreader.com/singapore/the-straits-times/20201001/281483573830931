    <p>In what is likely to go down as one of the low points in US pres­i­den­tial de­bate his­tory,</p>
    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den ex­pressed a level of con­tempt for each other un­heard of in mod­ern Amer­i­can pol­i­tics in a chaotic, 90-minute back-and-forth on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In­ter­rupted re­peat­edly by Mr Trump in their pres­i­den­tial de­bate, an ex­as­per­ated Mr Bi­den said at one point: “Will you shut up, man? This is so un-pres­i­den­tial.” He even called the Pres­i­dent a “clown” – twice.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent, in turn, mocked his op­po­nent’s aca­demic per­for­mance at the Univer­sity of Delaware where, ac­cord­ing to the Wash­ing­ton Post, Mr Bi­den grad­u­ated 506th in a class of 688. “He was the low­est or al­most the low­est in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me,” Mr Trump said. “Be­cause you know what, there’s noth­ing smart about you, Joe.”</p>
    <p>1 MESSY AF­FAIR</p>
    <p>Tues­day night was less a de­bate and more a spec­ta­cle. United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, 74, did the lion’s share of in­ter­rup­tions, fre­quently talk­ing over his op­po­nent Joe Bi­den, 77, and heck­ling him.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who of­ten could barely get a word in, was oc­ca­sion­ally thrown off bal­ance. “Will you shut up, man?” he said at one point. “This is so un­pres­i­den­tial... keep yap­ping, man.”</p>
    <p>This would have played dif­fer­ently to dif­fer­ent au­di­ences. Mr Trump’s sup­port­ers are likely to see him as strong and Mr Bi­den as a weak op­po­nent who needed the moder­a­tor to stand up for him. Mean­while, the Pres­i­dent’s de­trac­tors will call him a bully.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s strat­egy of ad­dress­ing the cam­era at times, di­rectly ask­ing the au­di­ence whether their life ex­pe­ri­ence con­tra­dicted the mirac­u­lous pan­demic re­cov­ery ex­tolled by Mr Trump, was very much in line with his brand of cam­paign­ing and folksy charm.</p>
    <p>All in all, the bar­rage of in­ter­rup­tions meant the two men could hardly en­gage with each other on sub­stan­tive points nor delve deep into pol­icy dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>2 THE SPEC­TRE OF SO­CIAL­ISM</p>
    <p>Mr Trump tried to paint Mr Bi­den as a so­cial­ist, while try­ing to pit the left wing of the Demo­cratic Party against Mr Bi­den for not be­ing left­ist enough for them.</p>
    <p>“They’re go­ing to dom­i­nate you, Joe, you know that,” said Mr Trump. “Your party wants to go so­cial­ist.”</p>
    <p>“I’m the Demo­cratic Party right now,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent re­sponded in a con­sis­tently mod­er­ate man­ner. Over the course of the de­bate, he ex­plic­itly said he was against de­fund­ing po­lice forces and did not sup­port the Green New Deal.</p>
    <p>3 PER­SONAL IN­SULTS SIG­NAL MORE UG­LI­NESS AHEAD</p>
    <p>At times, the de­bate de­scended into name-call­ing and in­sult-hurl­ing. Mr Bi­den called Mr Trump a clown, a fool, a liar, and the worst pres­i­dent the US has ever had.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump mocked Mr Bi­den’s in­tel­lect, say­ing he grad­u­ated at the bot­tom of his class. “Don’t ever use the word smart with me. There’s noth­ing smart about you, Joe.”</p>
    <p>The de­bate got es­pe­cially heated when Mr Trump went af­ter Mr Bi­den’s son Hunter, whom he ac­cused with­out proof of cor­rupt busi­ness deal­ings. He also ref­er­enced Hunter’s drug abuse and said he was “dis­hon­ourably dis­charged” from the mil­i­tary. Mr Bi­den, who had been in the mid­dle of prais­ing his late son Beau’s mil­i­tary ser­vice in Iraq, said: “That is sim­ply not true.”</p>
    <p>4 TRUMP DOU­BLES DOWN ON ELEC­TORAL FRAUD CLAIMS</p>
    <p>Asked about the in­tegrity of the elec­tion, Mr Trump dou­bled down on his un­sub­stan­ti­ated claims of voter fraud, call­ing the elec­tion rigged and say­ing: “This is not go­ing to end well.”</p>
    <p>He said he was urg­ing his sup­port­ers to “go into the polls and watch very care­fully”, in con­trast to Mr Bi­den’s pledge to call on his sup­port­ers to re­main calm on elec­tion night. Mr Bi­den also promised not to call a vic­tory un­til the re­sults had been in­de­pen­dently cer­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s com­ments raise the chance of un­rest should he lose.</p>
    <p>5 MOST VOT­ERS HAVE AL­READY MADE UP THEIR MINDS</p>
    <p>The de­bate is un­likely to close the gap be­tween the can­di­dates. Vot­ing is al­ready un­der way in many states and most peo­ple say their minds have al­ready been made up.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally, polls also do not shift that much at this stage.</p>
    <p>In a FiveThir­tyEight anal­y­sis of polls from 1976 to 2012, the dif­fer­ence be­tween polling leads just af­ter the first de­bate and at the end of the cam­paign was an av­er­age of 2.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>A Morn­ing Con­sult poll re­leased on Tues­day morn­ing found that 86 per cent of vot­ers say their po­si­tion was im­mo­bile, with only 14 per cent say­ing they might change their mind.</p>
