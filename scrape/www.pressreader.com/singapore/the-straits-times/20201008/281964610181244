    <p>•</p>
    <p>Cli­mate sci­en­tists have warned 2020 could be the world’s hottest year on record, with Septem­ber tem­per­a­tures eclips­ing pre­vi­ous highs and Arc­tic ice re­treat­ing from the seas it usu­ally cov­ers.</p>
    <p>Global year-to-date tem­per­a­tures show lit­tle de­vi­a­tion from 2016, the warm­est cal­en­dar year recorded so far, Europe’s Coper­ni­cus Cli­mate Change Ser­vice re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate pat­terns like La Nina in the Pa­cific Ocean, oc­cur­ring for the first time in eight years, could de­ter­mine whether this year turns out to be the warm­est on record, ac­cord­ing to the re­searchers.</p>
    <p>Last month, tem­per­a­tures reached 0.63 deg C above the 30-year his­tor­i­cal av­er­age, with the Siberian Arc­tic and south-east­ern Europe in par­tic­u­lar feel­ing the warm­ing ef­fects of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Arc­tic sea ice reached its sec­ond­low­est ex­tent for Septem­ber, con­tin­u­ing a fast de­cline since satel­lites started mon­i­tor­ing the ice in 1979.</p>
    <p>“There was an un­usu­ally rapid de­cline in Arc­tic sea ice ex­tent dur­ing June and July, in the same re­gion where above av­er­age tem­per­a­tures were recorded,” Coper­ni­cus di­rec­tor Carlo Buon­tempo said.</p>
    <p>“The com­bi­na­tion of record tem­per­a­tures and low Arc­tic sea ice in 2020 high­lights the im­por­tance of im­proved and more com­pre­hen­sive mon­i­tor­ing in a re­gion warm­ing faster than any­where else in the world.”</p>
    <p>This year’s record tem­per­a­tures in­cluded an Au­gust read­ing of 54.4 deg C in Death Val­ley, pos­si­bly the high­est ever recorded on earth.</p>
    <p>Wild­fires have also rav­aged Aus­tralia and western parts of the United States, in­clud­ing Cal­i­for­nia, where l and burnt has passed a record 1.6 mil­lion hectares, the state’s fire de­part­ment said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“As we go into an even warmer world, cer­tain ex­tremes are likely to hap­pen more of­ten and be more in­tense,” Coper­ni­cus senior scientist Freja Vam­borg said, point­ing to heat waves and pe­ri­ods of in­tense rain as ex­am­ples of this.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, last month was 0.05 deg C warmer than the same month last year and 0.08 deg C warmer than in 2016, pre­vi­ously the warm­est and sec­ond-warm­est Septem­bers, re­spec­tively, on record, the Coper­ni­cus data showed.</p>
    <p>Over the fi­nal three months of this year, cli­mate events such as the La Nina phe­nom­e­non and pro­jected low lev­els of au­tumn Arc­tic sea ice will in­flu­ence whether the year as a whole will be­come the warm­est on record, the Coper­ni­cus ser­vice said.</p>
    <p>The past five cal­en­dar years were the world’s warm­est on record. Av­er­age global tem­per­a­tures have al­ready climbed to roughly 1 deg C above pre-in­dus­trial times.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries agreed un­der the 2015</p>
    <p>Paris cli­mate ac­cord to at­tempt to cap warm­ing at 1.5 deg C, which sci­en­tists say would avoid the most cat­a­strophic im­pacts of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>But even though large emit­ters, in­clud­ing China and the Euro­pean Union, have pledged to slash their emis­sions in the com­ing decades, over­all, cur­rent poli­cies would see tem­per­a­tures rise far be­yond the 1.5 deg C level.</p>
    <p>“That is the key point. The earth has warmed a lot, and it will carry on warm­ing if green­house gas emis­sions con­tinue at the rate they are at the moment,” Dr Vam­borg said.</p>
