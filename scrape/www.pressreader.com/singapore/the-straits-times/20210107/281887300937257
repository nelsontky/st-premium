    <p>SYD­NEY • Un­rest broke out at an Aus­tralian is­land im­mi­gra­tion de­ten­tion cen­tre, the au­thor­i­ties and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions said yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing re­ports that the Christ­mas Is­land fa­cil­ity had been set alight by frus­trated de­tainees.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Bor­der Force said an op­er­a­tion was un­der way “to re­store or­der af­ter a dis­tur­bance” at the North West Point Im­mi­gra­tion De­ten­tion Cen­tre on the In­dian Ocean is­land.</p>
    <p>“A small num­ber of de­tainees caused some dam­age to the fa­cil­ity overnight and con­tinue to be non-com­pli­ant,” the agency said in a state­ment, adding that there were no re­ports of in­juries.</p>
    <p>Ad­vo­cacy group Refugee Ac­tion Coali­tion said re­ports from in­side the cen­tre sug­gested two com­pounds had been set ablaze on Tues­day and overnight into Wed­nes­day as ten­sions boiled over.</p>
    <p>“While the ex­tent of the dam­age is not known, the glare from the fires and the ex­tent of the smoke in the air in­di­cate the fires are sub­stan­tial,” the group said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Jus­tice Project prin­ci­pal so­lic­i­tor Ge­orge Ne­w­house said de­tainees were in­creas­ingly frus­trated with con­di­tions af­ter be­ing con­fined to their rooms for up to 22 hours a day and un­able to con­tact their fam­i­lies due to poor mo­bile phone sig­nals.</p>
    <p>“The fed­eral gov­ern­ment has a pol­icy of keep­ing de­tainees in harsh and in­hu­mane con­di­tions to force them to leave Aus­tralia,” Mr Ne­w­house said.</p>
    <p>“These harsh and soli­tary con­di­tions are hav­ing an ef­fect on the men­tal health and wel­fare of de­tainees.”</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Bor­der Force said the cen­tre was be­ing used to house “un­law­ful non-cit­i­zens” – mi­grants who had their visas can­celled af­ter be­ing con­victed of crimes – but would not con­firm how many peo­ple were cur­rently be­ing de­tained.</p>
    <p>The Refugee Coun­cil of Aus­tralia said the fa­cil­ity held 220 de­tainees as at Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Christ­mas Is­land, a trop­i­cal isle off Aus­tralia’s north-west coast, gained no­to­ri­ety as a venue where asy­lum seek­ers who at­tempted to reach the coun­try by boat were de­tained.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment con­tro­ver­sially re­opened the fa­cil­ity last Au­gust af­ter a two-year hia­tus, say­ing that main­land de­ten­tion cen­tres were fill­ing up as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic pre­vented the de­por­ta­tion of mi­grants.</p>
    <p>It was also used to quar­an­tine Aus­tralians evac­u­ated from Wuhan in Fe­bru­ary last year af­ter Covid-19 was first de­tected in the cen­tral Chi­nese city.</p>
