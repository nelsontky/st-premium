    <p>Those who have al­ways won­dered what Joseph School­ing’s train­ing reg­i­men is can find out to­day, and even choose to be coached by the Olympic cham­pion with the launch of his fit­ness app School­ing Sport.</p>
    <p>The app, which caters to all fit­ness lev­els, pro­vides a smart biofeed­back train­ing sys­tem with real-time and in­ter­ac­tive au­dio coaching based on users’ VO2­max – the max­i­mum amount of oxy­gen a per­son can use dur­ing ex­er­cise – and heart rate.</p>
    <p>Ex­er­cises and train­ing plans range from run­ning to yoga and School­ing, 25, told The Straits Times his his­tory-mak­ing feat at the 2016 Games, where he won Sin­ga­pore’s first Olympic gold, was an in­spi­ra­tion be­hind the app.</p>
    <p>“Fit­ness is an es­sen­tial part of life... it’s ob­vi­ously huge in my ca­reer and my life. I was think­ing about 2016 and we got fit­ter and stronger as we went on, and that was what pushed me to do what I did in Rio,” said School­ing.</p>
    <p>“You don’t re­ally need a lot of gym equip­ment nowa­days to train. I worked on this app with my trainer and we both came to the con­sen­sus that all you need is not a gym, (but) com­mit­ment, per­se­ver­ance and ef­fec­tive train­ing to get the best out of any­one’s body.</p>
    <p>“The whole fit­ness goal is to ed­u­cate peo­ple about train­ing es­pe­cially with a very short amount of time and very lit­tle equip­ment.”</p>
    <p>School­ing Sport is the lat­est fit­ness app to be launched in Sin­ga­pore in re­cent months. The oth­ers in­clude Lu­miHealth and Kem­tai.</p>
    <p>Lu­miHealth is a free app that was de­vel­oped by Ap­ple and the Health Pro­mo­tion Board (HPB). It was launched last month and is part of Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional drive to pro­mote a healthy life­style through the use of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>It can help users set fit­ness goals and healthy eat­ing tar­gets and also serve up re­minders for health screen­ing or im­mu­ni­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Users can also take part in well­ness chal­lenges and those who com­plete these tasks will be able to earn re­wards worth up to $380 in HPB e-vouch­ers from stores like FairPrice, Sheng Siong and Tangs.</p>
    <p>Kem­tai is a web ap­pli­ca­tion that uses ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to pro­vide its users with real-time feed­back and thus acts as a vir­tual per­sonal trainer. It launched in June and its an­nual pre­mium sub­scrip­tion is US$8 (S$10.70).</p>
    <p>The pro­grammes on the app are de­signed by train­ers from all over the world. Kem­tai uses com­puter vi­sion on a lap­top web browser to view and an­a­lyse users’ ex­act move­ments and guide their form through ver­bal in­struc­tions and live graphic demon­stra­tions. Users are awarded scores based on how ac­cu­rately they ex­e­cute a par­tic­u­lar ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>School­ing will work with health and fit­ness platform Pear Sports and strength coach Clint Martin to de­velop the ex­er­cises in the app.</p>
    <p>All School­ing Sport users are eli­gi­ble for a free two-week trial that pro­vides ac­cess to all fea­tures in the app. Af­ter the trial pe­riod, users will re­tain ac­cess to four pre­mium work­outs, in­clud­ing one led by the swim­mer, at no ad­di­tional cost. Sub­scrip­tions, which pro­vide users with full ac­cess, are avail­able from $5.99 a month and from $60 a year.</p>
    <p>School­ing will fea­ture in 15 of the</p>
    <p>“hun­dreds” of work­outs. The ses­sions last be­tween 15 min­utes and 35 min­utes. Col­lab­o­ra­tions with Olympians, world cham­pi­ons and fit­ness in­no­va­tors are in the works.</p>
    <p>School­ing Sport can be down­loaded from the App Store and Google Play store to­day. More in­for­ma­tion is avail­able at www.school­ingsport.com</p>
