    <p>I have a 13-year-old Westie, which has been eat­ing dry kibble since he was young. How­ever, he has re­cently de­vel­oped a taste for rice. I try to soften the kibble, but he still does not want to eat it. Is it pos­si­ble to give him com­pletely home-cooked meals in­stead? In ad­di­tion, he is al­ler­gic to chicken and can have only fish. How do I en­sure he has a bal­anced diet and what in­gre­di­ents should I in­clude in his meal plan?</p>

    <p>It is ad­vis­able to take your dog to a ve­teri­nar­ian for a health check to en­sure that there are no un­der­ly­ing health is­sues, in­clud­ing den­tal ones, that may have caused the change in di­etary pref­er­ence.</p>
    <p>There are com­mer­cial di­ets avail­able that your ve­teri­nar­ian will be able to rec­om­mend, and some of these di­ets are for­mu­lated for dogs with spe­cific med­i­cal con­di­tions, in­clud­ing al­ler­gies.</p>
    <p>While home-cooked di­ets for pets are be­com­ing in­creas­ingly pop­u­lar among pet own­ers, partly due to the large amount of in­for­ma­tion avail­able on­line, most own­ers may not have the right ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence to cre­ate a nu­tri­tion­ally bal­anced diet for their pets.</p>
    <p>It is ad­vis­able to work with a ve­teri­nar­ian or a board-cer­ti­fied vet­eri­nary nu­tri­tion­ist to cu­rate a diet that can meet the nutritiona­l and med­i­cal needs of your pet.</p>
    <p>Home-cooked di­ets may also be more ex­pen­sive in the long run and are more time-con­sum­ing to pre­pare. The con­sis­tency of each meal may also be af­fected as recipes may change with the avail­abil­ity of in­gre­di­ents and cook­ing method used.</p>
    <p>Lastly, own­ers should mon­i­tor their pet’s weight, body con­di­tion, skin or coat ap­pear­ance if it is put on a home-cooked diet.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar blood and urine tests for the pet should also be con­ducted. This is to en­sure that any nutritiona­l de­fi­ciency can be picked up early and ad­dressed by mod­i­fy­ing its diet.</p>
