    <p>• Sene­galese-Amer­i­can rap­per Akon (left) has set his sights on build­ing a sprawl­ing US$6 bil­lion (S$8.17 bil­lion) city, in­spired by the fic­tional Wakanda city from the Black Pan­ther comic book se­ries, in his home­land in Sene­gal.</p>
    <p>The R&B star, who has two multi-plat­inum al­bums, told a news con­fer­ence on Mon­day he had laid the first stone for the city in the At­lantic Ocean vil­lage of Mbo­d­i­ene, about 100km south of the Sene­galese cap­i­tal Dakar.</p>
    <p>Wakanda, the hid­den African king­dom of the Black Pan­ther se­ries, served as ad­di­tional in­spi­ra­tion, Akon ac­knowl­edged, in an­swer to a ques­tion.</p>
    <p>The comic se­ries was adapted into the ground­break­ing su­per­hero movie of the same name in 2018, star­ring ac­tor Chad­wick Bose­man, who died last Fri­day af­ter a pri­vate four-year bat­tle with colon can­cer.</p>
    <p>Akon, 47, said as he was grow­ing up in the Amer­i­can state of New Jersey, where his fam­ily moved when he was seven, he “ran into a lot of African-Amer­i­cans that didn’t re­ally un­der­stand their cul­ture”.</p>
    <p>“So I wanted to build a city or a project like this that will give them the mo­ti­va­tion to know that there is a home back home,” he said, adding that he had re­ceived the bless­ing – and ad­vice – of Mbo­d­i­ene’s el­ders.</p>
    <p>Akon City will of­fer ho­tels, a univer­sity, hospi­tals, busi­ness and leisure cen­tres in­clud­ing a casino, as well as movie stu­dios, all fea­tur­ing fu­tur­is­tic de­signs by ar­chi­tect Hus­sein Bakri.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing al­ter­nately in English and Wolof, the dom­i­nant lan­guage in Sene­gal, the rap­per said that Akon City would also in­clude a “vil­lage of African cul­tures”.</p>
    <p>“As you come in from Amer­ica, or Europe or any­where in the di­as­pora, and you feel like you want to visit Africa, we want Sene­gal to be your first stop,” said Akon, whose real name is Alioune Badara Thiam.</p>
    <p>He said the prin­ci­pal in­vestors of the project could not be named be­cause of con­fi­den­tial­ity clauses.</p>
    <p>Work will start early next year, with com­ple­tion of the first phase set for 2023. The town will ini­tially cover some 55ha and grow to 500ha by the end of the decade, with plans for ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands and a ma­rina that can ac­com­mo­date cruise ships.</p>
    <p>Akon is not the only in­ter­na­tional star with West African roots in­volved in such in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish ac­tor Idris Elba – son of a Ghana­ian mother and Sierra Leonean fa­ther – plans to build an eco­tourism com­plex on an is­land off Sierra Leone.</p>
