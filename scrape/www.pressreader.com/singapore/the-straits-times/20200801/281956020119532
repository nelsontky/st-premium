    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment is de­ter­mined to force its peo­ple to lose weight and wants this to hap­pen fast.</p>
    <p>“Obe­sity is one of the great­est long-term health chal­lenges that we face as a coun­try. It not only puts a strain on our Na­tional Health Ser­vice and care sys­tem, but it also piles pres­sure on our bod­ies, mak­ing us more vul­ner­a­ble to many dis­eases, in­clud­ing, of course, coro­n­avirus,” says Bri­tish Health Sec­re­tary Matthew Han­cock, who un­veiled this week a slew of mea­sures in­tended to “help peo­ple make health­ier choices” in the food they con­sume.</p>
    <p>But the mea­sures are al­ready un­der at­tack from op­po­si­tion politi­cians who dis­miss the ini­tia­tive as merely in­tended to de­flect at­ten­tion from the gov­ern­ment’s own record in man­ag­ing health crises, and from lead­ers in the food in­dus­try who com­plain that the new reg­u­la­tions are too costly.</p>
    <p>An anal­y­sis by the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment re­leased at the end of last year, just be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, found that Bri­tain is the sec­ond-fat­test na­tion in Europe, with al­most a third of the pop­u­la­tion clas­si­fied as over­weight.</p>
    <p>The re­port also claims that, as a re­sult, Bri­tons now live, on av­er­age, 2.7 years less com­pared with their Euro­pean peers.</p>
    <p>More alarm­ingly still, obe­sity among school­child­ren is on the rise, notwith­stand­ing the fact that menus in all schools have long been sub­ject to care­ful nu­tri­tional assess­ment.</p>
    <p>But it was the coro­n­avirus cri­sis that dra­mat­i­cally il­lus­trated the dan­gers of be­ing over­weight, for the lat­est statis­tics in­di­cate that the risks of dy­ing from the virus in­crease by at least 25 per cent if the af­fected per­son is over­weight.</p>
    <p>“This deadly virus has given us a wake-up call about the need to tackle the stark in­equal­i­ties in our na­tion’s health, and obe­sity is an ur­gent ex­am­ple of this,” says Mr Han­cock.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has al­ready pi­o­neered ef­forts to re­duce su­gar con­sump­tion by im­pos­ing higher taxes on sug­ary drinks and snacks.</p>
    <p>These are now likely to be re­in­forced by the in­tro­duc­tion of fur­ther re­stric­tions on un­healthy foods.</p>
    <p>A ban will be in­tro­duced on advertisin­g food high in salt, pro­cessed fats or su­gar be­fore the 9pm thresh­old on TV, to pre­vent man­u­fac­tur­ers of un­healthy prod­ucts from reach­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­kets will also be pre­vented from mak­ing “buy one, get one free” of­fers on items deemed un­healthy, and will be told not to clus­ter sweets and other sug­ary snacks around check­out coun­ters to dis­cour­age im­pulse buy­ing.</p>
    <p>And big res­tau­rant chains and take­away food out­lets with more than 250 em­ploy­ees will have to print on their menus the calo­rie con­tent of all the items they sell.</p>
    <p>“Our whole prin­ci­ple is to sup­port peo­ple to make the health­i­est choices for them­selves and their fam­i­lies,” says Mr Han­cock.</p>
    <p>How­ever, res­tau­rant chains that were badly hit by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic are al­ready com­plain­ing that the re­quire­ments for calo­rie la­belling im­pose ex­tra costs.</p>
    <p>And own­ers of pubs – which of­fer both drinks and food – claim that their busi­nesses should not carry the fi­nan­cial bur­den of tack­ling Bri­tain’s obe­sity prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish Beer and Pub As­so­ci­a­tion says that the mea­sures would be “pro­hib­i­tively ex­pen­sive” and that “mak­ing calo­rie la­belling manda­tory for all beer is un­nec­es­sary and bur­den­some”.</p>
    <p>Di­eti­tians are also di­vided about the use­ful­ness of TV bans on advertisin­g.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies by Cancer Re­search UK, a char­ity, found that al­most two-thirds of food ad­ver­tise­ments shown on Bri­tain’s top TV chan­nels were for prod­ucts high in fat, su­gar and salt, and tar­geted time slots most likely to be viewed by chil­dren.</p>
    <p>But chil­dren are more likely to be in­flu­enced to­day by so­cial me­dia and the be­hav­iour of role mod­els, mean­ing that re­stric­tions on TV advertisin­g are less mean­ing­ful.</p>
    <p>And op­po­si­tion politi­cians point out that gov­ern­ment plans do not ad­dress more fun­da­men­tal prob­lems of poverty and so­cial ex­clu­sion, which also re­sult in poor di­ets.</p>
    <p>Still, the mea­sures are likely to be im­ple­mented be­cause they en­joy strong sup­port from Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son came to of­fice dis­miss­ing the very idea of gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion over what the pub­lic should eat as “nanny statism”.</p>
    <p>But the Bri­tish premier had a con­ver­sion af­ter his own ex­pe­ri­ence with Covid-19; his life was in dan­ger and he had to be treated in in­ten­sive care, largely be­cause he was over­weight.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, Mr John­son is now an en­thu­si­as­tic con­vert. “Los­ing weight is hard, but with some small changes we can all feel fit­ter and health­ier,” he told the na­tion.</p>
    <p>And for good mea­sure, he posted a video of him­self, tak­ing an en­er­getic walk with his dog, to prove the virtues of healthy liv­ing.</p>
