    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are look­ing into a re­cent spike in bac­te­rial in­fec­tions that were as­so­ci­ated with eat­ing raw fresh­wa­ter fish in the past.</p>
    <p>In a Friday cir­cu­lar to doc­tors seen by The Sun­day Times, Min­istry of Health (MOH) med­i­cal ser­vices di­rec­tor Ken­neth Mak said 50 cases of in­va­sive Group B Strep­to­coc­cus (GBS) were re­ported by pub­lic hos­pi­tals last month – twice the av­er­age monthly fig­ure of 25 from ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Lab­o­ra­tory tests showed 18 of these cases were in­fected by GBS Type III ST283, and the pro­file of these pa­tients is sim­i­lar to those who were in­fected by the same bac­te­ria in a 2015 out­break caused by eat­ing raw fresh­wa­ter fish.</p>
    <p>Among the lat­est 18 cases, most were aged 65 years and above who de­vel­oped sep­ti­caemia or bac­ter­aemia, com­monly known as blood poi­son­ing. All of them were Chi­nese, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak in the cir­cu­lar.</p>
    <p>Most of the pa­tients have been dis­charged but one pa­tient died from an un­re­lated cause.</p>
    <p>“All med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers are re­quested to re­main vig­i­lant and to re­fer all pa­tients with symp­toms sug­ges­tive of se­vere GBS to a hos­pi­tal for as­sess­ment,” said Prof Mak.</p>
    <p>It is not known if the July in­fec­tions are linked to eat­ing raw fresh­wa­ter fish. ST has con­tacted MOH and the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency for more in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2015, the highly in­fec­tious strain of GBS caused an out­break of blood poi­son­ing in over 160 peo­ple, who suf­fered fever, joint in­fec­tion and menin­gi­tis. GBS is a com­mon bac­terium found in the hu­man gut and uri­nary tract of about 15 per cent to 30 per cent of adults with­out caus­ing dis­ease, said Prof Mak. It may oc­ca­sion­ally cause se­ri­ous in­fec­tions and symp­toms in­clude fever, chills and low alert­ness.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors con­firmed with ST yes­ter­day that they had re­ceived the cir­cu­lar and warned that the dis­ease could be eas­ily mis­di­ag­nosed as Covid-19 or dengue fever.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal, said this is be­cause the ini­tial symp­toms are “re­mark­ably sim­i­lar”.</p>
    <p>“You don’t want to put a strain on the ex­ist­ing sys­tem, al­ready laden with Covid-19 and dengue... It con­fuses the pic­ture,” he added.</p>
    <p>He said he has seen at least three GBS cases in re­cent weeks, and that 50 cases was a lot, con­sid­er­ing milder cases may not be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Dr Ray­mond Ong, a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner at In­temed­i­cal 24 Hour Clinic, said the symp­toms are the same as with many other in­fec­tions. As is the case with Covid-19 and dengue, most peo­ple re­cover, but GBS in­fec­tion is more dan­ger­ous for the el­derly and those with pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>Some se­nior cit­i­zens ST spoke to were wor­ried but added that they no longer con­sume raw food.</p>
    <p>Ms Laura Chia, 70, who was din­ing at Yishun Park Hawker Cen­tre yes­ter­day evening, said she stopped eat­ing raw food be­cause of con­tam­i­na­tion fears and a health scare af­ter eat­ing con­tam­i­nated seafood on hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>“My favourite used to be this por­ridge stall in Maxwell (Food Cen­tre), which also served raw fish. But they closed some years ago, and I’ve also stopped,” she said.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties banned the sale of such ready-to-eat fresh­wa­ter fish by retail food places af­ter the 2015 GBS out­break.</p>
    <p>A Hougang res­i­dent who wanted to be known only as Mr Lau, 77, was con­cerned that the re­cent in­fec­tions could be due to con­tam­i­na­tion while han­dling food.</p>
    <p>“When I was younger, I still ate raw food. Now, at my age, it is very risky to touch things that are not fully cooked,” said the re­tiree, a former fac­tory owner.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors stressed the im­por­tance of hy­giene in food prepa­ra­tion and con­sump­tion. Dr Ong said: “The dis­ease is trans­mit­ted through the fae­cal-oral route, so hand hy­giene is very im­por­tant.” He ad­vised con­sumers to wash their hands and not to cross-con­tam­i­nate cooked and un­cooked food.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong agreed, say­ing: “If we don’t clean food with GBS, we end up as food for the GBS.”</p>
