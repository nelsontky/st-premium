    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) will pre­scribe the Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora) as a fi­nan­cial bench­mark un­der the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act (SFA), as well as en­hance its trans­parency and data avail­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>These ini­tia­tives aim to catal­yse greater ac­tiv­ity in Sora mar­kets, safe­guard the bench­mark’s in­tegrity and en­hance mar­ket con­fi­dence in Sora, given its grow­ing im­por­tance as a key in­ter­est rate bench­mark in Sin­ga­pore dol­lar (SGD) fi­nan­cial mar­kets, MAS said in a state­ment yes­ter­day. They aim to com­ple­ment the in­dus­try-led tran­si­tion road map set out by the Steer­ing Com­mit­tee for SOR Tran­si­tion to Sora, to de­velop “vi­brant and ro­bust” Sora mar­kets, it said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is tran­si­tion­ing from the Swap Of­fer Rate (SOR) to Sora – the vol­ume-weighted av­er­age rate of bor­row­ing trans­ac­tions in the un­se­cured overnight in­ter­bank SGD cash mar­ket in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>SOR – the cur­rent bench­mark used to price de­riv­a­tives and busi­ness loans here – will be re­placed by Sora, given the end of the scan­dal­tainted Li­bor (Lon­don In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate) af­ter the end of next year, as the SOR uses United States dol­lar Li­bor in its com­pu­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Among the new ini­tia­tives by MAS is the is­suance of Sora-based float­ing rate notes on a monthly ba­sis, start­ing from Aug 21. This will broaden MAS’ suite of money mar­ket in­stru­ments used to man­age bank­ing sys­tem liq­uid­ity.</p>
    <p>It will fa­cil­i­tate the adop­tion of Sora as a float­ing rate bench­mark, pro­vide a pricing ref­er­ence for Sora cash prod­ucts, and spur hedg­ing ac­tiv­i­ties through the Sora de­riv­a­tives mar­ket, MAS said.</p>
    <p>It will also en­hance trans­parency and data avail­abil­ity on Sora. It will pub­lish, on a daily ba­sis, key sta­tis­tics in­volv­ing Sora, Com­pounded Sora rates for one-month, three­month and six-month tenors, and a Sora In­dex that will fa­cil­i­tate cal­cu­la­tion of Com­pounded Sora over spec­i­fied pe­ri­ods. The Sora In­dex is a daily data se­ries rep­re­sent­ing the re­turns from earn­ing com­pounded in­ter­est each day at the daily Sora rate.</p>
    <p>MAS said the Com­pounded Sora rates and the Sora In­dex will pro­vide mar­ket par­tic­i­pants with a stan­dard­ised and trans­par­ent ba­sis to de­rive rates for given tenors, which can be eas­ily ref­er­enced in new Sora prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tor has also pre­scribed Sora as a fi­nan­cial bench­mark un­der the SFA, to en­sure that reg­u­la­tory and en­force­ment pow­ers, in­clud­ing crim­i­nal and civil ac­tions, can be taken against any mar­ket mis­con­duct re­lated to Sora.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing a false or mis­lead­ing ap­pear­ance to the price, value, per­for­mance or rate of Sora, or pro­vid­ing or dis­sem­i­nat­ing any in­for­ma­tion, or ex­press­ing any opin­ion that is false or mis­lead­ing to the bench­mark ad­min­is­tra­tor, are ex­am­ples of mar­ket mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>Pre­scrib­ing Sora as a fi­nan­cial bench­mark un­der the SFA will safe­guard the in­tegrity and ro­bust­ness of Sora, given its grow­ing role as a key in­ter­est rate bench­mark for SGD fi­nan­cial mar­kets, said MAS.</p>
    <p>MAS has also is­sued a State­ment of Com­pli­ance with the In­ter­na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Se­cu­ri­ties Com­mis­sions Prin­ci­ples for Fi­nan­cial Bench­marks (Iosco Prin­ci­ples) for Sora, which fol­lows re­cent en­hance­ments to the method­ol­ogy of Sora to broaden its rep­re­sen­ta­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, Sora was based only on bro­kered un­se­cured overnight in­ter­bank SGD cash trans­ac­tions pro­vided by bro­kers. It now cap­tures both bro­kered and bi­lat­eral in­ter­bank trans­ac­tions pro­vided by re­port­ing banks to MAS.</p>
    <p>Com­pli­ance with Iosco Prin­ci­ples means that the ad­min­is­tra­tion of Sora meets in­ter­na­tional best prac­tice re­lat­ing to bench­marks ad­min­is­tra­tion, which is ex­pected to gen­er­ate broader mar­ket con­fi­dence by both do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional mar­ket par­tic­i­pants in the use of Sora.</p>
    <p>Ms Jac­que­line Loh, deputy man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at MAS, said: “These ini­tia­tives mark an im­por­tant mile­stone in sup­port­ing broad-based adop­tion of Sora in SGD fi­nan­cial mar­kets. They com­ple­ment the re­cently an­nounced in­dus­try pro­posal to shift to a Sora-cen­tred SGD in­ter­est rate mar­ket, by en­hanc­ing the ro­bust­ness of Sora and sup­port­ing the de­vel­op­ment of deep, liq­uid and ef­fi­cient Sora mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>In Au­gust last year, the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore and the Sin­ga­pore For­eign Ex­change Mar­ket Com­mit­tee iden­ti­fied Sora as the most suit­able bench­mark to re­place SOR as it was found to be the “most ro­bust and suit­able al­ter­na­tive”, un­der­pinned by a deep and liq­uid overnight fund­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Sora is a back­ward-look­ing overnight rate, as op­posed to the for­ward-look­ing ref­er­ence rates com­monly used for loans in Sin­ga­pore such as SOR, where the in­ter­est rate is de­ter­mined at the start of the in­ter­est pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral banks here have al­ready un­der­taken Sora de­riv­a­tives trans­ac­tions; they in­clude DBS Bank, Deutsche Bank, OCBC Bank, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank and United Over­seas Bank. OCBC has also launched Sin­ga­pore’s first home­loan ref­er­enc­ing the Sora.</p>
    <p>Banks in Sin­ga­pore are ex­pected to pi­lot more new Sora prod­ucts in the sec­ond half of the year.</p>
