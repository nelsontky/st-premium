    <p>Q What was your biggest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A Our biggest loss was on 24 Quan, a com­pany sim­i­lar to Groupon which was based in China.</p>
    <p>It was third in terms of mar­ket share at that time, but only one com­pany in the sec­tor sur­vived, so we lost our in­vest­ment of over US$10 mil­lion (S$13.7 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Most com­pa­nies fail be­cause of a lack of cap­i­tal. 24 Quan was in a red ocean com­pe­ti­tion – where the com­pany had to spend its way to the fin­ish line.</p>
    <p>At that time, we didn’t have the same deep pock­ets to keep the com­pany go­ing.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, the fund still did very well be­cause we were well di­ver­si­fied and there were sev­eral home runs in the fund. We no longer in­vest in B2C (busi­ness-to-con­sumer) com­pa­nies that re­quire a lot of spend­ing on mar­ket­ing to ac­quire cus­tomers where the biggest wal­let wins.</p>
    <p>My biggest miss was Alibaba. Jack Ma and his team came to see us when their val­u­a­tion was US$110 mil­lion, and we said no, be­cause they were then a B2B (busi­ness-to-busi­ness) mar­ket­place, which we were not too keen to in­vest in. We in­vested in Baidu in­stead, but could have done both.</p>
    <p>The biggest miss in terms of in­ter­nal rate of re­turn (IRR) was more re­cent. A good friend, John Hood, the ex-chief sci­en­tific of­fi­cer of Sa­mumed, one of our port­fo­lio com­pa­nies, started a com­pany called Im­pactBio and in­vited us to in­vest US$5m at a val­u­a­tion of US$55m.</p>
    <p>But our in­vestors’ money didn’t come in time, so we didn’t make the cut-off time. He sub­se­quently sold the com­pany for US$7.5 billion 18 months later.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A The best in­vest­ment in terms of ab­so­lute re­turns was Baidu, with a mul­ti­ple of over a thou­sand times for those that kept their shares. But in terms of IRR, it was 43 per cent, and my 10th best in­vest­ment. The top nine have IRRs from 46 per cent to 800 per cent.</p>
    <p>One of them is JJE, an elec­tric mo­tor and sys­tems spe­cial­ist for elec­tric ve­hi­cles. It just filed for an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing on the Shang­hai Stock Ex­change’s Star Mar­ket, and will be my sev­enth unicorn – val­ued at over US$1 billion.</p>
