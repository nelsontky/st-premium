    <p>United Over­seas Bank has some catch­ing up to do on the green bank­ing front, said a May­bank-Kim Eng an­a­lyst re­port, as it lags be­hind its peers on its en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance (ESG) fi­nanc­ing port­fo­lio and cer­tain diversity met­rics.</p>
    <p>As a bank with a wide re­gional foot­print, it is ex­posed to mul­ti­ple ESG risks – di­rectly and through its clients, said an­a­lyst Thi­lan Wick­ra­mas­inghe in a Sept 18 re­port.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal as well as gov­er­nance risks, money laun­der­ing and cor­rup­tion risks are par­tic­u­larly rel­e­vant for the bank, Mr Wick­ra­mas­inghe wrote.</p>
    <p>This comes as just 14 per cent of the bank’s in­cre­men­tal lend­ing in 2019 were for sus­tain­able uses, fall­ing be­hind peers which av­er­aged 35 per cent. UOB’s to­tal sus­tain­abil­ity port­fo­lio is around 2 per cent of its to­tal loans.</p>
    <p>The bank has es­tab­lished an ESG com­mit­tee that re­ports to the man­age­ment ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, which, how­ever, sits one notch be­low board level.</p>
    <p>The group has had sev­eral re­ported mis-sell­ing in­ci­dents in the past two years, which raise fair deal­ing and gov­er­nance risks, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Five of its per­sonal bankers were jailed or sanc­tioned – or both – be­tween 2018 and 2019 in sep­a­rate cases of mis-sell­ing and cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>As a lender to a wide base of small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in Sin­ga­pore, the bank, Mr Wick­ra­mas­inghe pointed out, is also “par­tic­u­larly ex­posed to so­cial risks” in terms of bal­anc­ing share­holder re­turns while sup­port­ing small busi­ness own­ers, against the back­drop of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>About 36 per cent of UOB’s cor­po­rate loans at the end of last year were made to busi­nesses clas­si­fied as SMEs.</p>
    <p>“This cre­ates no­table so­cial risks, given this is among the most im­pacted seg­ments un­der the cur­rent eco­nomic back­drop,” he said.</p>
    <p>These risks will rise as small busi­ness own­ers emerge from Covid-19 loan mora­to­ri­ums.</p>
    <p>Some 16 per cent of UOB’s loans are now un­der mora­to­rium, a bulk of which are set to ex­pire be­tween the third and fourth quar­ter of this year. The sit­u­a­tion may in­crease the risks of non-per­form­ing loans in the near term.</p>
    <p>From a diversity stand­point, women make up just 10 per cent of UOB’s board mem­ber­ship – the low­est among Sin­ga­pore banks – and 35 per cent of se­nior man­age­ment as at end-2019.</p>
    <p>Mr Wick­ra­mas­inghe also noted that com­pared with its lo­cal peers, UOB is “marginally be­low av­er­age” in dis­clo­sures in terms of ad­her­ing to ESG stan­dards.</p>
    <p>The an­a­lyst be­lieves that UOB’s ESG risks are typ­i­cal for a sys­tem­at­i­cally im­por­tant bank with re­gional pres­ence. “UOB dis­plays no ex­cep­tional risks that are not typ­i­cal for a large, re­gional D-SIB (do­mes­tic sys­tem­i­cally im­por­tant bank) for ESG,” Mr Wick­ra­mas­inghe wrote.</p>
    <p>He kept a “hold” rec­om­men­da­tion and a target price of $20.79 on the stock.</p>
    <p>Tighter net in­ter­est mar­gins and softer growth may fur­ther erode earn­ing vis­i­bil­ity, he flagged. Still, UOB is of­fer­ing a div­i­dend yield of 4.1 per cent even af­ter tak­ing into ac­count div­i­dend caps im­posed by the au­thor­i­ties, he noted.</p>
    <p>UOB shares closed yes­ter­day at $19.20, down $0.01.</p>
