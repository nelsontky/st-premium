    <p>With his up­beat new sin­gle The Dance Song, home-grown rap­per Yung Raja is gun­ning for the global stage.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old, who is signed to hip-hop mu­sic la­bel Def Jam South East Asia, is mak­ing progress.</p>
    <p>The song has al­ready sparked a dance craze dubbed #TheWig­glyChal­lenge – named af­ter the moves in the mu­sic video – on so­cial me­dia plat­form TikTok.</p>
    <p>Made by users from as far as the United States, the videos have been viewed close to six mil­lion times so far.</p>
    <p>He is the first Sin­ga­porean artist to be pro­moted glob­ally by Def Jam’s par­ent record la­bel Uni­ver­sal Mu­sic Group (UMG), whose global ros­ter of acts in­clude ma­jor names such as Tay­lor Swift and Ari­ana Grande.</p>
    <p>Last month, UMG launched The Dance Song at Ma­rina Bay Sands’ new Hy­brid Broad­cast Stu­dio. The event, which fea­tured a seg­ment in which a holo­graphic ver­sion of</p>
    <p>Yung Raja ap­peared on stage, was live-streamed to au­di­ences in Malaysia, In­dia and the US.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent Zoom in­ter­view, the rap­per, born Ra­jid Ahamed, says his song’s global reach is “break­ing bound­aries”.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing a mi­nor­ity, be­ing bilin­gual, be­ing an In­dian boy – or any of th­ese things that make me who I am – are now not cre­at­ing any bar­ri­ers for me to go places,” he says.</p>
    <p>The Dance Song, like his pre­vi­ous solo sin­gles – such as Poori Gang (Gucci Gang Remix, 2018), Mustafa (2018) and Mad Bless­ings (2019) – fea­ture lyrics in English and Tamil.</p>
    <p>“It is go­ing to open up so many new doors for so many other artists,” he says of the song’s world­wide reach. “Peo­ple are go­ing to take note of Sin­ga­pore­ans. A whole dif­fer­ent kind of light is be­ing shone on Sin­ga­pore’s mu­sic scene.”</p>
    <p>The song’s mu­sic video fea­tures him rap­ping and do­ing #TheWig­glyChal­lenge in lo­ca­tions here such as the Ma­rina Bay area and has cameos by com­pa­tri­ots such as home-grown rap­per Fariz Jabba. The track is pro­duced by reg­u­lar col­lab­o­ra­tor Flightsch.</p>
    <p>It was the mu­sic video’s di­rec­tor, an­other reg­u­lar col­lab­o­ra­tor, Vad­bibes (real name Jasper Tan), who sug­gested he wig­gle his hands and legs in a hu­mor­ous man­ner, giv­ing birth to the dance move.</p>
    <p>“The next thing you know, it’s a dance chal­lenge,” the rap­per says. “The best part about it is, if some­body is film­ing you do it, he will prob­a­bly smile and l augh be­cause it looks so goofy. It’s so fun, good vibes, ev­ery­body’s smil­ing. That’s what we were try­ing to go for with The Dance Song as well.”</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the bach­e­lor, who lives with his par­ents, spends most of his time at home with his fam­ily th­ese days.</p>
    <p>It is a wel­come change, he says, as he has been busy with per­for­mances and other mu­sic work in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia in the past few years.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor-turned-musician first came to promi­nence with the song Mustafa, which clocked 2.1 mil­lion views on YouTube. On Spo­tify, it peaked at No. 2 on the Sin­ga­pore Vi­ral 50 chart and No. 3 on the Malaysia Vi­ral 50 chart.</p>
    <p>He also sang i n last year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade theme song, Our Sin­ga­pore, and per­formed at the pa­rade.</p>
    <p>“I re­alise that fam­ily time is pri­ori­tised more now,” he says. “It is some­thing I seek refuge in, in this world of un­cer­tain­ties. With so many crazy things re­ported in the news daily, you can get a bit weighed down.”</p>
