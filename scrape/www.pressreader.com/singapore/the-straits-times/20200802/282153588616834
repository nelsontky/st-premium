    <p>Rac­ing Point boss Ot­mar Szaf­nauer has sug­gested that For­mula One teams may need to keep driv­ers within pro­tec­tive “bub­bles” for the re­main­der of the season, after their driver Ser­gio Perez con­tracted Covid-19 fol­low­ing a trip home to Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>The Mexican, who will not only miss to­day’s Bri­tish Grand Prix at Silverston­e but is also likely to be ab­sent for next week­end’s 70th An­niver­sary race at the same venue, is cur­rently self-iso­lat­ing after be­com­ing the first F1 driver to be in­fected since the start of the season.</p>
    <p>Un­der cur­rent en­hanced health pro­to­cols amid the coron­avirus pan­demic, all F1 per­son­nel are re­quired to re­main within the safety “bub­ble” dur­ing race week­ends, but they can leave it out­side of events.</p>
    <p>While Red Bull boss Chris­tian Horner called Perez’s pos­i­tive test “a stark re­minder that these pro­ce­dures are here for a rea­son”, Szaf­nauer jumped to his driver’s de­fence, in­sist­ing it was “no dif­fer­ent to Fer­rari going back to Italy”.</p>
    <p>But, when asked whether the mo­tor sport’s Covid-19 mea­sures needed tight­en­ing, the Ro­ma­ni­aborn Amer­i­can agreed it might be something to con­sider.</p>
    <p>“Be­tween Hun­gary and here, we had that week­end off, ev­ery­body went to where their fam­i­lies were,” he told a video news con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s closed-door race.</p>
    <p>“In hind­sight, per­haps we should look at that, change the code and say through­out the season you stay within your bub­ble.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know. That’s something for the (gov­ern­ing body) FIA to con­sider.</p>
    <p>“I read through the code a cou­ple of times now and it is a liv­ing doc­u­ment. They say at the very be­gin­ning, from time to time as we learn this will change, so per­haps that will change.”</p>
    <p>Szaf­nauer also con­firmed that a small group of Rac­ing Point em­ploy­ees, in­clud­ing his phys­io­ther­a­pist and personal as­sis­tant, who had come into con­tact with Perez, were in quar­an­tine as a pre­cau­tion but none had tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>F1 has been op­er­at­ing in “bub­bles within bub­bles” at race­tracks, with groups of em­ploy­ees kept apart from oth­ers within the same team.</p>
    <p>The teams are also sep­a­rated from each other. Even the select group of re­porters al­lowed into the me­dia centre can talk to driv­ers and team of­fi­cials only re­motely.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­body must also test neg­a­tive before they can en­ter the pad­dock at the start of an event.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the free­dom of move­ment when there are no back-to­back races ap­pears to be a loop­hole in which the virus can pen­e­trate the “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, F1 may “con­sider fur­ther tight­en­ing its Covid-19 code of con­duct to im­pose a season-long re­stric­tive ‘bub­ble’ on per­son­nel”, according to The Guardian.</p>
    <p>In hind­sight, per­haps we should look at that, change the code and say through­out the season you stay within your bub­ble.</p>
