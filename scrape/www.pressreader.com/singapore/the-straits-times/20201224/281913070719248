    <p>Sev­eral years ago, I met a group of vis­it­ing In­done­sians ded­i­cated to re­li­gious har­mony. To be hon­est, I am rather scep­ti­cal of peo­ple who preach peace and for­give­ness when they have never been tested by vi­o­lence them­selves. This group was dif­fer­ent be­cause of at least one of its mem­bers.</p>
    <p>He is a Chris­tian who lost his brother to a mob of Mus­lim ri­ot­ers. If I re­mem­ber cor­rectly, it oc­curred dur­ing the re­li­gious vi­o­lence that erupted in 1999 in Am­bon in Maluku prov­ince.</p>
    <p>I asked him if he hated Mus­lims. “No,” he replied qui­etly. “My brother and I could have been Mus­lims, and Chris­tians could have killed him.” (The vi­o­lence in­deed was two-way.) “Should I have hated Chris­tians then? If ‘yes’, should I hate my­self for be­ing a Chris­tian to­day? If ‘no’, why should I hate Mus­lims to­day?”</p>
    <p>The pro­found sim­plic­ity of his an­swer hit me like a slap in the face. How fool­ish I was to have asked him that ques­tion. He de­stroyed for me the prim­i­tive sense of the word “iden­tity” for­ever, the sense that iden­tity in­heres in a sin­gle and ul­ti­mate char­ac­ter­is­tic of a per­son. In­stead, iden­tity is mul­ti­fac­eted, sit­u­a­tional, fluid, and thus ca­pa­ble of change and evo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple who killed his brother had as­signed an exclusive and hos­tile re­li­gious iden­tity to him, in op­po­si­tion to what they thought was their own exclusive re­li­gious iden­tity. How­ever, the In­done­sian re­fused to con­cede his brother’s hu­man­ity and his own to an as­sumed Chris­tian/Mus­lim bi­nary di­vide. He lived above the realm of mur­der­ers. That was his iden­tity, and no killers could de­prive him of it although they had taken his brother’s life.</p>
    <p>His de­fi­ance of im­puted iden­ti­ties res­onates with the in­sights of No­bel lau­re­ate Amartya Sen’s book, Iden­tity And Vi­o­lence: The Il­lu­sion Of Destiny. The book analy­ses the re­la­tion­ship between iden­tity and vi­o­lence by plac­ing both within the siren calls of destiny.</p>
    <p>Sen came of moral and in­tel­lec­tual age in 1944, when, as an 11-year-old in Dhaka, he saw a pro­fusely bleed­ing man stum­ble into his Hindu home look­ing for help and a lit­tle wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The man’s name was Kader Mia, a poor Mus­lim day labourer. He had been knifed by Hindu thugs on his way to find­ing work, even dur­ing the com­mu­nal ri­ots, be­cause his fam­ily had noth­ing to eat. Sen’s father took Kader Mia to hospi­tal but he died.</p>
    <p>Poor Hindu labour­ers met the same fate at the hands of ma­raud­ing Mus­lim mobs. The dif­fer­ence between life and death de­pended solely on re­li­gious iden­ti­fi­ca­tion by those who car­ried weapons.</p>
    <p>That ex­pe­ri­ence of vi­o­lence, gen­er­ated by the quest for a sin­gle and unique iden­tity, il­lu­mi­nates the im­pas­sioned dis­quiet present in ev­ery page of Sen’s book. It shows how the re­duc­tion of hu­mans to exclusive re­li­gions, cul­tures and civil­i­sa­tions un­der­mines the uni­ver­sal rel­e­vance of other ways in which they see them­selves, and would wish to be seen and ac­cepted.</p>
    <p>Those other ways in­clude class, gen­der, pro­fes­sion, lan­guage, lit­er­a­ture, science, mu­sic, morals and pol­i­tics. They are al­ter­na­tive and le­git­i­mate means of self-iden­ti­fi­ca­tion, Sen says. They form the di­verse bases of com­pet­ing iden­ti­ties that re­sist the temp­ta­tion to be­long to a sin­gu­lar, pu­ta­tive iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple must be free to choose their iden­ti­ties be­cause only per­sonal choice makes them re­spon­si­ble for the so­cial out­comes of that choice. Hu­man free­dom con­sti­tutes the ori­gin of the pub­lic good.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, im­posed iden­ti­ties di­min­ish hu­man agency to the point of ex­tinc­tion. That is when in­di­vid­u­als could be led to vi­o­lence since they have been ma­nip­u­lated into be­liev­ing that they are act­ing for larger ends – “the il­lu­sion of destiny” in the sub­ti­tle of Sen’s book – by killing, maim­ing, rob­bing or ex­il­ing an en­emy, stranger, neigh­bour or erst­while friend be­cause of dif­fer­ent be­liefs, ideas or ways of life.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans would be mis­lead­ing them­selves if they were to think that the lure of a sin­gu­lar iden­tity ex­ists only else­where.</p>
    <p>I was once in­vited to a lo­cal con­fer­ence where I made the point that no one is de­fined by a sin­gle iden­tity. I gave ex­am­ples of my own mul­ti­ple iden­ti­ties: a man (gen­der), a Ben­gali (lan­guage), a worker (class), and so on. I ex­ist in the in­ter­play of such iden­ti­ties, I said. I thought that this char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion would be self-ev­i­dent. It was not.</p>
    <p>A young man in the au­di­ence chal­lenged me later. “Those are not iden­ti­ties,” he de­clared im­pe­ri­ously. “Those are roles. I have only one iden­tity: my reli­gion.”</p>
    <p>I re­coiled in sur­prise. Roles? If my lan­guage and gen­der are mere roles, who would help ad­vance their cause for me if I face dis­crim­i­na­tion on those ac­counts? No one, be­cause oth­ers would be con­tained in and by their own roles.</p>
    <p>But if my iden­ti­ties re­quire me to take re­spon­si­bil­ity for what is hap­pen­ing to me (as they must), then the con­flu­ence of my mul­ti­ple selves should im­bue me with the agency to face up to an un­just or­der of things, whether for me or for oth­ers as well.</p>
    <p>I shall act against cir­cum­stances that de­prive me (and oth­ers) of the right to ex­ist as a free in­di­vid­ual, equal to all oth­ers, in the in­di­vis­i­ble com­bi­na­tion of com­mon hu­man rights and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>When my hu­man­ity is ques­tioned, im­paired or at­tacked, I must protest, op­pose and re­sist op­pres­sion. That is not my role. That is me.</p>
    <p>I did not waste time re­spond­ing to the in­ter­locu­tor. He is play­ing his “roles” to this day, no doubt.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, I am en­joy­ing my iden­ti­ties, one of which con­sists of writ­ing this ar­ti­cle. I am a worker: I work with words. I am a Ben­gali who writes in English, but I was born a Ben­gali and shall die one. I am a man to whom a woman gave birth. That woman is a part of me.</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple are like me. We re­ject, along with Sen, what he calls the soli­tarist il­lu­sion of iden­tity, the no­tion that an iden­tity is the func­tion of one exclusive do­main of life. Who­ever lives cooped up in one room when she or he is free to move around the whole house?</p>
    <p>In­stead, most hu­mans are sol­i­darists, that is, gre­gar­i­ous an­i­mals who at­tach mean­ing to pass­ing ex­is­tence by find­ing their place in the di­ver­sity in which they are embed­ded. That di­ver­sity ranges over the en­tire gamut that Sen men­tions, from class to pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Reli­gion plays a vi­tal role, of course, in the for­ma­tion of sol­i­darist iden­ti­ties. The In­done­sian whom I met at­trib­uted the ab­sence of his ha­tred for Mus­lims to his Chris­tian faith. Kshiti Mo­han Sen, Amartya Sen’s grand­fa­ther, was a noted San­skrit scholar whose work cel­e­brated the lib­erty of thought within Hin­duism. That in­ter­nal di­ver­sity en­abled it to in­cor­po­rate ex­ter­nal chal­lenges to its va­lid­ity with the help of Is­lamic Sufi tra­di­tions of co­ex­is­tence, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Reli­gion mat­ters. But if reli­gion makes us wor­thy of ex­is­tence, that life also is im­pli­cated in the over­lap­ping cor­re­spon­dence of mul­ti­ple iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise death would pre­vail. A slain In­done­sian and Kader Mia would say so.</p>
