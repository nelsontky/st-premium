    <p>Sev­eral malls – Nex, VivoCity and Sun­tec City – were among the new places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Also newly added to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious pa­tients were Bras Basah Com­plex, Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket and Food Centre, and Wood­lands Civic Centre.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited to get peo­ple who were at those places to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>It has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned, if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Two new clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cochrane Lodge II at 49 Ad­mi­ralty Road West was linked to 14 cases, while eight newly con­firmed cases were linked to 10 previous cases to form a clus­ter at Westlite Toh Guan dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>Two com­mu­nity cases were also re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Both cases were unlinked as at yes­ter­day and were picked up as a re­sult of proac­tive sur­veil­lance and screen­ing, even though they did not have symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The two were de­tected as a re­sult of ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine and process sec­tors who live out­side dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>MOH said epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions of the cases are be­ing done. Their close con­tacts have also been iso­lated and quar­an­tined, and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Among the five im­ported cases an­nounced yes­ter­day are a Sin­ga­porean who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from Bangladesh on Mon­day, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who ar­rived from In­dia on Aug 22 and a Sin­ga­porean who ar­rived from the United Arab Emi­rates on Aug 22.</p>
    <p>An­other im­ported pa­tient is a long-term visit pass holder who ar­rived from In­dia on Aug 23.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing im­ported pa­tient is a work per­mit holder cur­rently em­ployed here who ar­rived from the Philip­pines on Aug 22.</p>
    <p>All five were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were tested while serv­ing their no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 41 of the 48 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,908.</p>
    <p>Of these, 22 had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of previous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing quar­an­tine to de­ter­mine their sta­tus.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 19 cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as bi-weekly ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from two cases two weeks ago to three in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of unlinked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also in­creased, from a daily av­er­age of one case to two over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 137 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,013 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 52 pa­tients re­mained in hospi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 801 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
