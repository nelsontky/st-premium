    <p>As in most places, the travel in­dus­try in the United States is reel­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But it also of­fers one bright spot: an uptick in do­mes­tic travel as Amer­i­cans flee their crowded cities for the wide open spa­ces of na­tional parks such as Yosemite as well as re­mote moun­tain towns such as Du­rango, Colorado (see other story) – places peo­ple have been com­ing to so­cial-dis­tance since be­fore it was cool.</p>
    <p>And mea­sures be­ing in­tro­duced in th­ese spots – re­duced ca­pac­ity, al­fresco din­ing and min­i­mum ho­tel stays to lower turnover – paint a pic­ture of what travel in the era of so­cial dis­tanc­ing may even­tu­ally look like.</p>
    <p>The dawn of that era sug­gests trav­ellers are avoid­ing densely pop­u­lated ar­eas and seek­ing out less busy ones.</p>
    <p>Old tourist hubs such as New York City or San Fran­cisco are be­ing shunned in favour of less touristed towns within a day’s drive of ma­jor cities. And hol­i­days in­volv­ing camp­ing, hik­ing and other out­door pur­suits, as well as get­ting around by car, mo­torhome or camper van are all the rage.</p>
    <p>Vis­its to the coun­try’s more than 400 na­tional parks have also soared, with Yel­low­stone in Wy­oming, home to the fa­mous Old Faith­ful geyser, see­ing its busiest Septem­ber on record.</p>
    <p>An­other pop­u­lar spot is Yosemite in Cal­i­for­nia, where the lo­cal tourism body, Visit Yosemite – Madera County (www.yosemite thisyear.com), has help­fully as­sem­bled a list of so­cially dis­tanced itin­er­ar­ies.</p>
    <p>It was not hard draw­ing up that list, says Mrs Brooke Smith, its di­rec­tor of pub­lic re­la­tions. “Th­ese are wide open spa­ces and peo­ple have been com­ing to des­ti­na­tions like Yosemite to so­cial dis­tance since be­fore so­cial dis­tanc­ing was even some­thing in our ver­nac­u­lar.”</p>
    <p>This year has taken it to a new level, though.</p>
    <p>“In 2019, the top search terms driv­ing traf­fic to the Visit Cal­i­for­nia web­site were ‘ Dis­ney­land’, ‘Bixby Bridge’, ‘Venice Beach’ – all those big des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“In Au­gust 2020, the top searches were for Bass Lake and Lake Ar­row­head, th­ese re­ally small alpine lakes,” says Mrs Smith.</p>
    <p>And while tourism-re­lated busi­nesses across the coun­try are hurt­ing, for towns such as Du­rango – a four- to six-hour drive from any ma­jor air­port – there has been some­thing of a travel boom.</p>
    <p>Mrs Theresa Graven, Visit Du­rango’s tourism and com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor, re­veals it had the high­est ho­tel occupancy in the state of Colorado for the months of July to Septem­ber. “And that’s never hap­pened – we never had a greater occupancy than (the state cap­i­tal) Den­ver or places like that.”</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ob­servers had an­tic­i­pated do­mes­tic travel would pick up in the sum­mer even as vis­its from for­eign trav­ellers slowed to a trickle be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pected peo­ple would get out and travel and that it would be the year of the road trip – and that’s ex­actly what hap­pened,” Mrs Graven says.</p>
    <p>But far-flung Du­rango – a more ob­scure Colorado des­ti­na­tion than the ski towns of Aspen or Vail or the Rocky Moun­tain Na­tional Park – seems to hold spe­cial ap­peal.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple drive five to 10 hours here from Utah, New Mex­ico, Ari­zona and Texas be­cause they want to es­cape the big cities there.”</p>
    <p>And an­other draw: low Covid-19 case counts in La Plata county, where Du­rango is lo­cated. As of last week, it had logged just over</p>
    <p>1,000 cases in an area of 4,400 sq km. This is com­pared with pop­u­lous Los An­ge­les county in Cal­i­for­nia, with 374,000 cases over an area of 1,300 sq km.</p>
    <p>As much as they wel­come the busi­ness, how­ever, Du­rango is keen to pro­mote re­spon­si­ble tourism. It has taken pains to com­mu­ni­cate to vis­i­tors that face masks are man­dated in restau­rants, shops and pub­lic places where peo­ple can­not main­tain a dis­tance of 1.8m from one an­other.</p>
    <p>With many US cities and coun­ties each hav­ing its own mask laws, this is of­ten far from clear.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to let peo­ple know what to ex­pect when they got here, be­cause wear­ing a mask has been so con­tentious, with peo­ple up in</p>
    <p>arms fight­ing over the con­sti­tu­tion­al­ity of it,” says Mrs Graven. “And we’ve heard from a lot of vis­i­tors that they ap­pre­ci­ated that.”</p>
    <p>An­other trend she has ob­served: more peo­ple choos­ing to stay in bou­tique ho­tels or AirBnB-type ac­com­mo­da­tions.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause there is more pri­vacy and less in­ter­ac­tions with other guests, ver­sus the shared HVAC (heat­ing, ven­ti­la­tion and air-con­di­tion­ing) in a big ho­tel and shared lobby spa­ces,” she notes.</p>
    <p>Bou­tique prop­er­ties such as Du­rango’s Rochester Ho­tel have in­sti­tuted a min­i­mum four-night stay to re­duce guest turnover and in­tro­duced key­less en­try sys­tems to cut down on per­son-to-per­son con­tact.</p>
    <p>This is sim­i­lar to ini­tia­tives be­ing taken by tourism op­er­a­tors in the towns sur­round­ing Yosemite, who have in­tro­duced “re­ally strin­gent clean­ing prac­tices and let­ting the rooms sit idle for a day”, along with a host of con­tact­less book­ing, tick­et­ing and or­der­ing sys­tems, says Mrs Smith.</p>
    <p>As long as the weather co­op­er­ates, al­fresco din­ing has be­come the new norm, and once again, hav­ing the space makes all the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Du­rango has blocked off lanes on its main av­enue to cre­ate “bumpouts”, or out­door din­ing ar­eas for street-fac­ing restau­rants and ho­tels.</p>
    <p>“That saved our down­town restau­rants,” Mrs Graven says.</p>
    <p>“And some ho­tels did bet­ter this Au­gust than they did the last, a lot of it due to hav­ing that ex­tra out­door seat­ing.”</p>
    <p>Yet the city is wary of be­com­ing a lit­tle too suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause cer­tain places, like Moab in Utah, have been vic­tims of their own suc­cess and be­come over­run, and it’s re­ally neg­a­tively im­pact­ing the des­ti­na­tion,” she ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want that to hap­pen here, so part of our strat­egy will be to do more to spread vis­i­tors out through­out the year and move them into lesser-known ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>The city is also “be­ing re­ally thought­ful about who we in­vite to Du­rango”, she adds.</p>
    <p>“We’re fo­cused on a higher</p>
    <p>value, more sus­tain­able trav­eller – which in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers are for us, so we’re re­ally look­ing for­ward to their re­turn.”</p>
    <p>As US des­ti­na­tion mar­ket­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions speak to tourism op­er­a­tors across the world, the feed­back they keep get­ting is that in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers are “chomp­ing at the bit to book their travel here”, says Mrs Smith.</p>
    <p>“As soon as the travel re­stric­tions are lifted, the flood­gates are go­ing to open and peo­ple will be com­ing back. And they will want to know where they can go and feel safe.”</p>
    <p>I’ll ad­mit I had not even heard of Du­rango, Colorado, un­til a few months ago.</p>
    <p>But cabin fever from months un­der lock­down due to the pan­demic had sparked an in­tense long­ing for an out­doorsy hol­i­day. And know­ing long hikes and long drives of­ten re­store me to my fac­tory set­tings, I be­gan re­search­ing places to go in Colorado, known for its stun­ning alpine scenery, hot springs and plethora of out­door pur­suits.</p>
    <p>Friends sug­gested pop­u­lar spots such as Colorado Springs or the Rocky Moun­tain Na­tional Park, but then I met a woman from the Du­rango tourism of­fice at the Go West Sum­mit, a vir­tual tourism in­dus­try event fo­cus­ing on the Amer­i­can West, who told me about this hid­den gem in south-west Colorado.</p>
    <p>You need to drive a bit to get there, but that would be part of my de­com­pres­sion. I flew from Los An­ge­les, where I am based, to Al­bu­querque, New Mex­ico, then did an easy 31/ 2- hour drive to Du­rango.</p>
    <p>I ar­rived as the sun was set­ting on its charm­ing down­town area, framed by the San Juan Moun­tains and shim­mer­ing An­i­mas River and dot­ted by Vic­to­rian struc­tures from the late 19th cen­tury, when this was a bustling min­ing town.</p>
    <p>One of them is the Rochester Ho­tel (www.rochester­ho­tel.com), a cosy bou­tique prop­erty taste­fully dec­o­rated to re­flect the town’s past as the “Hol­ly­wood of the Rock­ies”, its hall­ways adorned by posters of Westerns filmed in the area, in­clud­ing Butch Cas­sidy And The Sun­dance Kid (1969) and How The West Was Won (1963).</p>
    <p>It is a good base from which to ex­plore the sur­round­ing ar­eas and the town it­self, which has no short­age of ex­cel­lent din­ing op­tions, whether it is an al­fresco bite at the 11th Street Sta­tion Food Truck Col­lec­tive or at farm-to-ta­ble restau­rant Eo­lus, which you can then walk off with a lovely stroll along the river.</p>
    <p>But if it is his­tory you want, there is no bet­ter time-travel ma­chine than the Du­rango & Sil­ver­ton Nar­row Gauge Rail­road (www. du­ran­go­train.com), a steam­pow­ered, coal-fired train that has been run­ning since the 1880s, when it fer­ried gold and sil­ver from mines in the San Juan Moun­tains.</p>
    <p>The route is noth­ing short of spec­tac­u­lar, run­ning par­al­lel, in parts, to the San Juan Sky­way, a se­ries of wind­ing roads that has been rated one of the most scenic drives in the United States. The train roars and whis­tles thrillingl­y as it winds along clifftops, rivers and canyons, of­fer­ing breath­tak­ing and, from the few open-air cars, ver­tig­i­nous views of the land­scape.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the ride, you can stop for lunch at James Ranch, a 162ha fam­ily farm that has been a pi­o­neer in the sus­tain­able agri­cul­ture move­ment that is so trendy now.</p>
    <p>Grab a seat out­doors and or­der one of the de­lec­ta­ble burg­ers from the James Ranch Grill (www.james ranch.net/grill) – made from beef that has been raised its whole life on green pas­tures, then cooked to per­fec­tion and topped with one of the raw cheeses made in-house.</p>
    <p>A short hop away is the Du­rango Hot Springs Re­sort & Spa (www. du ran go hot springs re­sort and spa. com), a rather civilised way to en­joy one of Colorado’s many min­eral-rich geo­ther­mal springs, which you can com­fort­ably soak in even in the depths of win­ter.</p>
    <p>Du­rango also puts you within strik­ing dis­tance of Mesa Verde Na­tional Park – a Unesco World Her­itage site – and the Canyons of the An­cients Na­tional Mon­u­ment nearby.</p>
    <p>Here, you can hike past the ru­ins of cliff dwellings and other re­mark­able struc­tures built by the</p>
    <p>Anasazi, an an­cient Na­tive Amer­i­can cul­ture – ei­ther alone or with a knowl­edge­able guide from Du­rango River­trip­pers (www. du­ran­goriver­trip­pers.com), which has an ar­chae­ol­o­gist who can ex­plain the fas­ci­nat­ing his­tory of the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr John Sut­cliffe, who owns the only win­ery in the area, Sut­cliffe Vine­yards (www.sut­clif­fewines. com) – a per­fect spot for a bit of apres-hike wine-tast­ing – will also re­gale you with sto­ries of lo­cal Na­tive Amer­i­can his­tory.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the sea­son, there is heaps more to do in and around Du­rango, but I chose to end my trip</p>
    <p>by driv­ing two hours to an­other far-flung moun­tain town, Ou­ray.</p>
    <p>In the win­ter, it is home to a world-fa­mous ice-climb­ing park, but an­other must-do here is the Ou­ray Via Fer­rata – “via fer­rata” is an Ital­ian term for a ca­bled and runged rock-climb­ing course across a steep sec­tion of moun­tain, in­vented as a way to move sol­diers across the Dolomites in World War I. This one is about 1.25km long and takes three to five hours to com­plete as you clip and un­clip your­self to a se­ries of ca­bles high above the Un­com­pah­gre River.</p>
    <p>No rock-climb­ing ex­pe­ri­ence is nec­es­sary, but novices must hire a</p>
    <p>guide from a com­pany such as San Juan Ex­pe­di­tions in Du­rango (san juan­ex­pe­di­tions.com) and fol­low strict safety pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Be­ing rea­son­ably strong and not too scared of heights help as well, and while I was far from per­fect on both those fronts, it oc­curred to me – as I hung on for dear life – that you can­not get more “out­side” than this.</p>
    <p>Which makes it ar­guably one of the best things you can do to es­cape from it all dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
