    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Two of Mr Don­ald Trump’s Se­nate al­lies have warned that Repub­li­cans may re­ject the le­git­i­macy of vote re­sults if these turn against the em­bat­tled United States Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>As a few Repub­li­cans dis­tanced them­selves from Mr Trump’s un­sub­stan­ti­ated al­le­ga­tions of fraud in Tues­day’s elec­tion, sen­a­tors Lind­sey Gra­ham and Ted Cruz en­thu­si­as­ti­cally backed him in backto-back ap­pear­ances on Fox News.</p>
    <p>“I will tell you the Pres­i­dent is an­gry, and I am an­gry, and the vot­ers ought to be an­gry,” Mr Cruz told the net­work’s host Sean Han­nity, whose evening show is a favourite of Mr Trump’s.</p>
    <p>Mr Cruz al­leged falsely that Penn­syl­va­nia’s Demo­cratic At­tor­ney-Gen­eral had or­dered vote count­ing in the state’s largest city of Philadel­phia “un­til Joe Bi­den wins”. “We need to get in there now,” Mr Cruz said, re­fer­ring to vot­ing cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia of­fi­cials said they will con­tinue count­ing votes from Tues­day’s elec­tion un­til they have ac­counted for all bal­lots. The state’s Repub­li­can-led leg­is­la­ture had re­fused to al­low vote count­ing be­fore elec­tion day de­spite a del­uge of mail-in bal­lots due to safety con­cerns amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal bal­lots be­ing counted are largely from Philadel­phia and are ex­pected to favour Mr Bi­den, who would cap­ture the White House with a vic­tory in the state.</p>
    <p>Asked by Mr Han­nity if the Penn­syl­va­nia leg­is­la­ture could refuse to recog­nise the re­sults and in­stead give the state’s elec­toral votes to Mr Trump, Mr Gra­ham replied: “I think ev­ery­thing should be on the ta­ble.” “Philadel­phia elec­tions are crooked as a snake. Why are they shut­ting peo­ple out? Be­cause they don’t want peo­ple to see what they are do­ing,” added Mr Gra­ham, who eas­ily won re-elec­tion on Tues­day in South Carolina de­spite a ma­jor Demo­cratic push.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign has pushed for its ob­servers to have closer ac­cess to vote count­ing. Philadel­phia had al­lowed in the ob­servers but asked them to keep a dis­tance of at least 4.5m due to the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion. A court on Thurs­day sided with the Trump cam­paign and per­mit­ted the ob­servers to go closer, but the Philadel­phia Board of Elec­tions ap­pealed to the Penn­syl­va­nia Supreme Court, say­ing that they had suf­fi­cient ac­cess in line with the law.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Mr Trump’s sons de­clared their fil­ial loy­alty.</p>
    <p>“The best thing for Amer­ica’s fu­ture is for @re­alDon­aldTrump to go to to­tal war over this elec­tion to ex­pose all of the fraud, cheat­ing, dead/no longer in state vot­ers, that has been go­ing on for far too long,” Mr Don­ald Trump Jr, the el­dest, wrote on his Twit­ter ac­count.</p>
    <p>His younger brother Eric called on Repub­li­can vot­ers, writ­ing: “Where are Repub­li­cans! Have some back­bone. Fight against this fraud.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s older daugh­ter and se­nior ad­viser Ivanka tweeted on Thurs­day that her fa­ther “will al­ways go to the mat fight­ing for the hard­work­ing men and women of this great coun­try”.</p>
    <p>ROUS­ING REPUB­LI­CANS</p>
    <p>I will tell you the Pres­i­dent is an­gry, and I am an­gry, and the vot­ers ought to be an­gry.</p>
