    <p>While I dis­agree with dis­crim­i­nat­ing against any spe­cific group, I am in full agree­ment with Me­di­a­corp that it had “no in­ten­tion to dis­re­spect or dis­crim­i­nate against the LGBTQ (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer) com­mu­nity in the drama” My Guardian An­gels (Me­di­a­corp says sorry for por­trayal of pae­dophile char­ac­ter in drama, July 16).</p>
    <p>The drama series was a de­pic­tion of ev­ery­day life in Sin­ga­pore. It could have been a story about a bad fa­ther phys­i­cally or sex­u­ally abus­ing his child.</p>
    <p>Such cases have oc­curred and been re­ported in the news. It would not make much sense for fa­thers to be up in arms over the de­pic­tion of an abu­sive fa­ther in a drama series.</p>
    <p>There­fore, a story of a pae­dophile bas­ket­ball coach should not stand out as a case of dis­crim­i­na­tion against the LGBTQ com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Bran­don Wong and Kym Ng played par­ents con­cerned about their charge.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery cou­ple would wish that their child does not de­vi­ate from their own closely held moral val­ues, and would try to im­part these val­ues to their chil­dren. It would be a gross in­jus­tice to la­bel this “ho­mo­pho­bic”.</p>
    <p>It is sad that de­spite know­ing Wong and Ng have re­ceived “abu­sive mes­sages”, Me­di­a­corp has cho­sen to bend over to “can­cel cul­ture” and of­fer an apol­ogy.</p>
    <p>This sets a dan­ger­ous prece­dent.</p>
