    <p>When coun­try bor­ders closed six months ago be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, an im­me­di­ate con­cern here was food se­cu­rity, as most of what is sold here is im­ported.</p>
    <p>That – com­bined with most peo­ple be­ing stuck at home with time on their hands dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April to June – saw a flurry of in­ter­est here in plant­ing ed­i­bles at home.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board (NParks), which en­cour­ages the com­mu­nity to en­hance the en­vi­ron­ment through plants and gar­dens, also fanned the flames of the grow­ing move­ment by send­ing out free seeds un­der the Gar­den­ing With Ed­i­bles ini­tia­tive from June to this month.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial plan was to send out 150,000 pack­ets of seeds for veg­eta­bles such as kailan, cu­cum­ber and lady’s finger. But the re­sponse was so over­whelm­ing that they were all taken up on the first day. More were added and, by the end of this month, 400,000 pack­ets will have been given out.</p>
    <p>NParks has been sow­ing in­ter­est in grow­ing ed­i­ble plants for a long time by pro­vid­ing sup­port to com­mu­nity gar­dens around the is­land. Res­i­dents adopt plots of land for free in these gar­dens and 80 per cent are used to grow ed­i­bles.</p>
    <p>In a huge nurs­ery in HortPark off Pasir Pan­jang Road, where many ed­i­ble plants are cul­ti­vated for the coun­try’s parks and gar­dens, a small num­ber are ear­marked to be sold at its Gar­den­ers’ Day Out event, where work­shops and bazaars at­tract hordes of hob­by­ist gar­den­ers.</p>
    <p>NParks also runs an Al­lot­ment Gar­den­ing Scheme, where peo­ple can adopt a 2.5m by 1m raised planter bed for three years at $57 a year and re­ceive gar­den­ing ad­vice. The planters are found in 12 parks, in­clud­ing in Ang Mo Kio, Be­dok and Cle­menti, and are fully sub­scribed.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, at­ten­tion has also been given to grow­ing ed­i­bles that are not of­ten planted here or thought to be im­pos­si­ble to prop­a­gate in Sin­ga­pore’s trop­i­cal cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Dr Wil­son Wong, deputy di­rec­tor of NParks’ Jurong Lake Gar­dens, who spe­cialises in ed­i­ble plants and helms the weekly Root Awak­en­ing col­umn in The Straits Times, is col­lect­ing such un­com­mon va­ri­eties for an up­com­ing gar­den at the former Chi­nese Gar­den.</p>
    <p>He is grow­ing Jerusalem ar­ti­choke, which is na­tive to North Amer­ica; ele­phant foot yam, which is pop­u­lar in In­dian cook­ing; and peter pep­pers from the Amer­i­cas, among other ex­otic plants. He also has 150 cul­ti­vars of mint, some of which have an un­ex­pected smoky or cho­co­late flavour.</p>
    <p>He says his show­case helps to pique the in­ter­est of gar­den­ers.</p>
    <p>Among these are the com­mu­nity gar­den­ers, who are reg­u­lars at</p>
    <p>NParks events and are old hands at grow­ing fa­mil­iar veg­eta­bles such as xiao bai cai and kangkong.</p>
    <p>At the 420 sq m Marine Cres­cent Ville com­mu­nity gar­den, for ex­am­ple, ste­via, In­dian let­tuce and curly leaf kale grow among the more fa­mil­iar pan­dan and curry leaves.</p>
    <p>There is rice too, with sheaves of grain wait­ing to ripen, and Dayak onion, which is eaten by the in­dige­nous tribe in Sarawak.</p>
    <p>Madam Gina Ong, 61, started the gar­den in 2002 from a former carpark and now runs it with about 20 other gar­den­ers, each adopt­ing a plot to grow what he or she de­sires.</p>
    <p>She had no knowl­edge of gar­den­ing in the beginning, she says. “I liked to cook and used to buy a whole bunch of veg­eta­bles or herbs just to cook a dish. I wanted a gar­den so I could just cut what I needed,” she adds.</p>
    <p>She started by grow­ing herbs such as thyme and sage, but these failed. “It was all through trial and er­ror. There was no web­site to do re­search then. I went to the herb gar­dens in Sen­tosa and Fort Can­ning to see what was grown there.”</p>
    <p>Madam Ong also tried – and suc­ceeded in – grow­ing im­ported veg­eta­bles she bought at the su­per­mar­ket, such as curly leaf kale.</p>
    <p>The gar­den now hosts more than 100 va­ri­eties and har­vests are shared with res­i­dents. There are no fences and any­one can help him­self or her­self to the herbs and fruit.</p>
    <p>Fel­low gar­dener Rosita Cedillo, 79, says: “We just let them know that they should cut what they want with scis­sors in­stead of up­root­ing the whole plant.”</p>
    <p>The avid cook ex­per­i­ments with the pro­duce in the kitchen, in­clud­ing mak­ing mul­berry jam from fruit grown in the gar­den.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, at the 930 sq m Cosy Gar­den in Bukit Ba­tok, ex­otic ed­i­bles such as figs, scotch bon­nets, red Rus­sian kale, as­para­gus, ju­jube, white brin­jals and Brazil­ian grapes thrive. There is also a cof­fee plant, though there are no berries yet.</p>
    <p>Gar­den leader May Lee, 64, takes it as a chal­lenge to cul­ti­vate these un­com­mon va­ri­eties.</p>
    <p>She tried to grow broc­coli as well, but dis­cov­ered it did not fare well in wet weather. Another fail­ure was pipa, which grew but did not fruit.</p>
    <p>But she man­aged to coax other tem­per­ate plants, such as kale and grapes, to pros­per by shield­ing them from the hot sun with gauze or grow­ing them un­der taller plants that pro­vide shade.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nity gar­den is open to the pub­lic. Be­fore the pan­demic, stu­dents – from pre-school to univer­sity – would visit al­most every week­day.</p>
    <p>The har­vest is shared with res­i­dents. Pre­vi­ously, it was also cooked at a small kitchen in the void deck of a flat next to the gar­den for block par­ties.</p>
    <p>Hob­by­ist gar­dener Alex Ng, 48, did not man­age to sub­scribe to the com­mu­nity gar­den near his Hous­ing Board flat in Yishun.</p>
    <p>So he rented a 100 sq m pri­vate plot in Sembawang three years ago for $400 a month, where he has been grow­ing black­ber­ries, figs, straw­ber­ries, edamame, radish, pur­ple car­rots and pump­kins.</p>
    <p>His in­ter­est in grow­ing ex­otic plants started when he saw grape saplings selling in a nurs­ery one day and bought one to grow in the cor­ri­dor out­side his apart­ment.</p>
    <p>“Sur­pris­ingly, it grew very well. After half a year, it was block­ing the light, so I pruned it and it started flow­er­ing and fruit­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>That sparked his cu­rios­ity to find out what else he could grow, but not ev­ery­thing was as easy. The straw­ber­ries turned out to be sweet but small, and the black­berry plant sprouted only after three months.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng says his biggest chal­lenge is grow­ing toma­toes, which are prone to dis­ease and pests, and con­sid­ers the pump­kins and black­ber­ries to be his most sat­is­fy­ing suc­cesses. He plans to plant rasp­ber­ries next.</p>
    <p>The plants are grown from seeds and cut­tings, some of which he or­ders through the mail.</p>
    <p>He vis­its his plot every morning to water the plants and spends about three hours there at a time. On very hot days, he re­turns in the evening, mak­ing the 2km jour­ney each way by bus.</p>
    <p>The home baker, who lives alone, does not cook and has not tasted the veg­eta­bles he grows. They are given away to his sib­lings and friends.</p>
    <p>But he en­joys the fruit, in­clud­ing his grapes, which are re­lated to the Ky­oho cul­ti­var and taste “sweet and fra­grant”.</p>
