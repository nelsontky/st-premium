    <p>Three Sin­ga­pore­ans de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act for their in­volve­ment in ter­ror­ism-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties have been re­leased and placed on Re­stric­tion Or­ders (ROs), said the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They had shown good progress in their re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and were assessed to no longer pose a se­cu­rity threat that re­quires pre­ven­tive de­ten­tion, it added.</p>
    <p>ROs is­sued against an­other five Sin­ga­pore­ans were also al­lowed to lapse as they had shown good progress in their re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The three Sin­ga­pore­ans re­leased from de­ten­tion are:</p>
    <p>• Muham­mad Fadil Ab­dul Hamid, 31, a self-rad­i­calised in­di­vid­ual who was de­tained from 2010 to 2012 for in­tend­ing to en­gage in armed vi­o­lence in Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>He was re­leased in 2012 and placed on an RO, but was de­tained again in April 2016 af­ter in­ves­ti­ga­tions showed he had re­verted to the be­lief that mil­i­tant ji­had was the eas­i­est way to achieve mar­tyr­dom. He was re­leased on an RO in April this year.</p>
    <p>• Hu­saini Is­mail, 61, a former Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) mem­ber de­tained in June 2012, fol­low­ing his de­por­ta­tion to Sin­ga­pore from In­done­sia a month ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Hu­saini had fled Sin­ga­pore in the wake of se­cu­rity op­er­a­tions against the JI net­work in De­cem­ber 2001. He was re­leased on an RO in June this year.</p>
    <p>• Rosli Hamzah, 54, a self-rad­i­calised in­di­vid­ual who was de­tained in Au­gust 2016.</p>
    <p>He had har­boured the in­ten­tion to travel to Syria to fight along­side the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and was re­leased on an RO in Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>The five Sin­ga­pore­ans whose ROs were al­lowed to lapse are:</p>
    <p>• Mo­hamed Mo­hideen Mo­hamed Jais, 30, who per­formed armed sen­try du­ties in Ye­men while pur­su­ing his re­li­gious stud­ies there from 2009 to 2011. He was is­sued an RO in March 2016, and it was al­lowed to lapse in March this year.</p>
    <p>• A self-rad­i­calised Sin­ga­porean ISIS sup­porter who was 17 in July 2016 when he was is­sued an RO. His RO was al­lowed to lapse in July this year.</p>
    <p>• Mo­hamad Reiney Noor Mohd, 30, a self-rad­i­calised in­di­vid­ual who started sup­port­ing ISIS af­ter com­ing across its pro­pa­ganda on­line. He was is­sued an RO in Au­gust 2016, and it was al­lowed to lapse in Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>• As­rul Alias, 37, a self-rad­i­calised in­di­vid­ual who ac­tively searched for pro-ISIS ma­te­rial on­line, and shared them on Face­book and What­sApp to spread ISIS ide­ol­ogy. He was is­sued an RO in Au­gust 2016, and it was al­lowed to lapse in Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>• Ishak Mo­hamed Noohu, 59, a former JI mem­ber who was de­tained in Novem­ber 2006 and re­leased on an RO in Novem­ber 2012. His RO was al­lowed to lapse in Oc­to­ber this year.</p>
