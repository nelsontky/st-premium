    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysian po­lice said they will take ac­tion not just against gam­bling syn­di­cates, but also prop­erty own­ers who rent out their premises for il­le­gal pur­poses, in re­sponse to claims of il­le­gal gam­bling resur­fac­ing on busi­ness premises in Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>“Prior to this, our fo­cus was on the syn­di­cates, but now, we will be tak­ing ac­tion against all those con­nected to il­le­gal gam­bling, in­clud­ing own­ers of premises who have abused their busi­ness li­cences,” said Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment (CID) di­rec­tor at Bukit Aman po­lice head­quar­ters, Com­mis­sioner Huzir Mohamed.</p>
    <p>He said ac­tion can be taken un­der the Preven­tion of Crime Act and Anti-Money Laun­der­ing and An­tiTer­ror­ism Fi­nanc­ing Act.</p>
    <p>“We are se­ri­ously con­sid­er­ing us­ing these two Acts, as cer­tain gam­bling syn­di­cates have re­sumed op­er­a­tions. Bukit Aman CID has been going all out to com­bat il­le­gal on­line gam­bling since early last year, but the ac­tiv­ity has re­turned na­tion­wide, es­pe­cially in Se­lan­gor,” he said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“We will co­op­er­ate more closely with agen­cies such as (power util­ity) Te­naga Na­sional and lo­cal coun­cils. We will also iden­tify and rec­om­mend to lo­cal coun­cils to re­voke the busi­ness li­cences of those in ca­hoots with il­le­gal gam­bling syn­di­cates,” Datuk Huzir said.</p>
    <p>Agen­cies such as Te­naga Na­sional would be tasked with cut­ting off elec­tric­ity to the premises used by the syn­di­cates to in­stall their gam­bling ma­chines, he added.</p>
    <p>Last Saturday, videos claim­ing il­le­gal gam­bling was tak­ing place and con­tra­band cig­a­rettes were be­ing sold in Ban­dar Baru Sun­gai Bu­loh, Se­lan­gor, at the north-west edge of Kuala Lumpur, went vi­ral on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>An eight-minute video gar­nered over two mil­lion views, and an­other 13-minute clip has over 4.5 mil­lion views. A com­plainant also al­leged that his life could be in dan­ger for re­veal­ing the il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Sun­gai Bu­loh dis­trict po­lice chief, Su­per­in­ten­dent Shafa’aton Abu Bakar, has de­nied al­le­ga­tions of in­ac­tion over il­le­gal gam­bling ac­tiv­i­ties in the dis­trict, in re­sponse to the vi­ral videos.</p>
    <p>She de­scribed the al­le­ga­tions made by a Face­book user as un­true and in­ac­cu­rate.</p>
    <p>“Two po­lice re­ports have been lodged by the Sun­gai Bu­loh po­lice sta­tion chief and an of­fi­cer from the Shah Alam City Coun­cil. His al­le­ga­tions could tar­nish the im­age of the po­lice force, es­pe­cially that of the Se­lan­gor po­lice in our ef­forts to curb il­le­gal gam­bling in the state, es­pe­cially in Sun­gai Bu­loh,” she told a news con­fer­ence on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>She added that the po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the mat­ter and will call up the man who made the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
