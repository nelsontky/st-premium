    <p>Cou­ples are look­ing to ex­pand their wedding plans af­ter the Gov­ern­ment said on Wed­nes­day that more peo­ple can at­tend wedding cer­e­monies and re­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous limit was 50 but this will dou­ble to 100 from Oct 3.</p>
    <p>Wedding venue op­er­a­tors and wedding plan­ners have since been get­ting more queries. But some op­er­a­tors are still fig­ur­ing out how to stag­ger crowds across dif­fer­ent zones and tim­ings, while en­sur­ing that safe man­age­ment mea­sures are ad­hered to.</p>
    <p>Still, some cou­ples are stick­ing to their orig­i­nal plans of hav­ing just 50 peo­ple at their wed­dings, cit­ing rea­sons such as un­cer­tainty on whether the venues can ac­com­mo­date more peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Wedding plan­ners and venue op­er­a­tors have re­ceived a num­ber of in­quiries overnight from cou­ples look­ing to in­crease the num­ber of guests they can in­vite to their wed­dings.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while these op­er­a­tors are hop­ing to ac­com­mo­date the re­quests, some of them are still fig­ur­ing out the lo­gis­tics of sep­a­rat­ing guests into dif­fer­ent zones and im­ple­ment­ing stag­gered tim­ings to en­sure they ad­here to safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry on Wed­nes­day an­nounced that from Oct 3, up to 100 unique at­ten­dees, in­clud­ing the wedding cou­ple but ex­clud­ing ven­dors and ser­vice providers, will be al­lowed to at­tend re­cep­tions, up from the cur­rent limit of 50. Guests will have to be split into mul­ti­ple zones of up to 50 peo­ple each, or split by stag­gered tim­ings, with up to 50 peo­ple in each time slot.</p>
    <p>At least 30 min­utes should be al­lo­cated be­tween time slots for clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion of the space.</p>
    <p>With the re­laxed re­stric­tions, some cou­ples are hop­ing to ex­pand their guest lists for their wedding cer­e­monies.</p>
    <p>The Fuller­ton Ho­tels and Re</p>
    <p>sorts re­ceived more than 30 in­quiries from cou­ples to in­crease the num­ber of guests for their wed­dings since the an­nounce­ment, said its gen­eral man­ager Cava­liere Giovanni Vit­erale.</p>
    <p>Wedding plan­ning com­pany Arches & Co said four out of five cou­ples who have wed­dings sched­uled from next month to De­cem­ber are look­ing to in­vite more guests.</p>
    <p>Its founder, Ms Michelle Lau, said: “How­ever, they are also con­cerned if their venues will be able to ac­com­mo­date such rules, given the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place and stag­gered tim­ings.</p>
    <p>“But for new in­quiries, most are look­ing at the sec­ond half of next year, and they are hope­ful that the guest lim­its will con­tinue to in­crease.”</p>
    <p>Ho­tels and venue op­er­a­tors are look­ing at ways to in­crease ca­pac­ity lim­its while en­sur­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures re­main in place.</p>
    <p>One Far­rer Ho­tel in Far­rer Park is putting to­gether a pack­age to live-stream the main ban­quet hall event with 50 at­ten­dees to pri­vate din­ing rooms within the premises.</p>
    <p>Each din­ing room will likely ac­com­mo­date five din­ers, “which may be ex­panded in line with fur­ther changes to health safety reg­u­la­tions”, said its gen­eral man­ager, Mr Gil­bert Mad­ha­van.</p>
    <p>At Capella Sin­ga­pore on Sen­tosa, cou­ples wish­ing to ex­pand their guest list be­yond 50 peo­ple can hold the cer­e­mony across lunch and din­ner to stag­ger tim­ings for their guests, or even have the event over two dates, said its spokesman.</p>
    <p>Spread­ing out the cel­e­bra­tions over lunch and din­ner is also some­thing wedding plan­ning com­pany Wedding Diary is con­sid­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Lily Lu, its lead plan­ner, said the com­pany is also look­ing to split guest lists of more than 50 into sep­a­rate re­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>The venue also plays a part, she added. “Zon­ing re­ally de­pends on the lay­out and flow of the space. For in­stance, some venues can al­low us to hold 50 guests in­doors and 50 out­doors, but oth­ers might not,” she noted.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing able to in­vite more peo­ple, some cou­ples are stick­ing to their plan of hav­ing 50 guests.</p>
    <p>Ms Hellen Lie, cre­ative direc­tor of wedding plan­ner Rosette De­signs & Co, said 12 of her 13 cou­ples are not chang­ing their plans to have 50 guests, as they are “turned off” by the stag­gered tim­ings that come with the dou­bled ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Bride-to-be Kelly Cheng, 25, who had planned to have her wedding on Oct 4, de­cided to hold her solem­ni­sa­tion cer­e­mony on that date in­stead and post­pone the ban­quet to May next year.</p>
    <p>“We’re still stick­ing to our orig­i­nal plan of hav­ing 30 guests at our solem­ni­sa­tion, since it’s too close to the ac­tual date,” said Ms Cheng, a prod­uct man­ager.</p>
    <p>“I don’t mind hav­ing a smaller ses­sion with a close group of friends and fam­ily. But we hope to do a ban­quet with at least 200 peo­ple next year, when hope­fully my rel­a­tives in Hong Kong can fly in to at­tend my wedding,” she said.</p>
    <p>Zon­ing re­ally de­pends on the lay­out and flow of the space. For in­stance, some venues can al­low us to hold 50 guests in­doors and 50 out­doors, but oth­ers might not.</p>
    <p>MS LILY LU, lead plan­ner of wedding plan­ning com­pany Wedding Diary.</p>
