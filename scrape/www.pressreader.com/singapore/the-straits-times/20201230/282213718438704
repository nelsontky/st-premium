    <p>HONG KONG • Jack Ma’s un­der­seige Ant Group is plan­ning to fold its fi­nan­cial op­er­a­tions into a hold­ing com­pany that could be reg­u­lated more like a bank, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the sit­u­a­tion, po­ten­tially crip­pling the growth of its most prof­itable units.</p>
    <p>The fin­tech gi­ant is plan­ning to move any unit that would re­quire a fi­nan­cial li­cence into the hold­ing com­pany, pend­ing reg­u­la­tory ap­proval, said the peo­ple, who asked not to be named be­cause the mat­ter is pri­vate. The plans are still un­der dis­cus­sion and subject to change, they said.</p>
    <p>Ant de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tions that Ant is look­ing to fold into the hold­ing com­pany in­clude wealth man­age­ment ser­vices, con­sumer lend­ing, in­sur­ance, pay­ments and MYbank, an on­line lender in which Ant is the largest share­holder, the peo­ple said. Un­der the fi­nan­cial hold­ing com­pany struc­ture, Ant’s busi­nesses would likely be subject to more cap­i­tal re­stric­tions, po­ten­tially curb­ing its abil­ity to lend more and ex­pand at the pace of the last few years.</p>
    <p>That said, the pro­pos­als sug­gest that Ant would still be able op­er­ate in fi­nan­cial ser­vices be­yond its pay­ments busi­ness, quelling in­vestor con­cern about how to in­ter­pret the cen­tral bank’s Sun­day mes­sage when it asked Ant to re­turn to its roots as a pay­ments provider.</p>
    <p>“This means China is still try­ing to en­cour­age do­mes­tic con­sump­tion and they need plat­forms like Ant to help with con­sumer loans,”</p>
    <p>said Shang­hai-based an­a­lyst Wang Zhen at UOB-Kay Hian Hold­ings. “The key is that con­sumer lend­ing shouldn’t be over-lever­aged.”</p>
    <p>SoftBank Group rose as much as 4.5 per cent in Tokyo trad­ing yes­ter­day. The Ja­panese com­pany is the largest share­holder in Alibaba Group Hold­ing, a ma­jor backer of Ant.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors told Ant to de­vise a plan to over­haul its busi­ness, the lat­est in a se­ries of steps to rein in Mr Ma’s on­line fi­nance em­pire. While it stopped short of di­rectly ask­ing for a break-up of the com­pany, the cen­tral bank stressed that Ant needed to “un­der­stand the ne­ces­sity of over­haul­ing its busi­ness” and come up with a timetable as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Its growth would slow a lot,” said Mr Fran­cis Chan, a Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence an­a­lyst in Hong Kong. The val­u­a­tion of the non-pay­ment busi­nesses, in­clud­ing wealth man­age­ment and con­sumer lend­ing, could be slashed by as much as 75 per cent, he said.</p>
    <p>Ant was last month poised for a pub­lic list­ing that would have val­ued it at more than US$300 bil­lion (S$398.7 bil­lion), be­fore reg­u­la­tors in­ter­vened and scut­tled the ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO).</p>
    <p>It held US$11 bil­lion in cash and equiv­a­lents as of June, ac­cord­ing to its IPO fil­ing. The com­pany said in its prospec­tus in Oc­to­ber that it would use its sub­sidiary Zhe­jiang Fi­nance Credit Net­work Tech­nol­ogy to ap­ply for the fi­nan­cial hold­ing li­cence.</p>
    <p>Un­der rules that took ef­fect last month, non-fi­nan­cial com­pa­nies which con­trol at least two cross­sec­tor fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions are re­quired to hold a fi­nan­cial hold­ing li­cence.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan es­ti­mates that Ant needs to in­ject at least 70 bil­lion yuan (S$14.2 bil­lion) of new cap­i­tal just for its credit-lend­ing busi­ness. That cal­cu­la­tion is based on draft rules that re­quire Ant to co-fund 30 per cent of loans, with a max­i­mum as­set lever­age of five times.</p>
    <p>LIFE­STYLE UNITS</p>
    <p>Ant is plan­ning to leave its dig­i­tal life­style busi­ness – the ser­vices that link users with food de­liv­er­ies, on-de­mand neigh­bour­hood ser­vices and ho­tel book­ings – out of the fi­nan­cial hold­ing com­pany, one of the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Ant will still be the par­ent of all those op­er­a­tions, the per­son added.</p>
    <p>Ant is not work­ing on a pro­posal to break up the com­pany at this time, though it is seek­ing more guid­ance from reg­u­la­tors on what struc­ture will be ac­cept­able and may change its plans based on that feed­back, that per­son said.</p>
    <p>Ant’s val­u­a­tion could fall to below US$153 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to Mr Chan, sim­i­lar to where it stood two years ago after a fundrais­ing round.</p>
