    <p>Three stints in prison for fraud and crim­i­nal breach of trust con­vinced bud­ding en­tre­pre­neur Anil David, 52, that it was time he did some­thing more with his life.</p>
    <p>His re­solve prompted him to build on an idea he had while in prison. Mr Anil went on to found so­cial en­ter­prise Agape Con­nect­ing Peo­ple with his wife in 2012.</p>
    <p>It be­gan as a call cen­tre, but has evolved into a multi-chan­nel con­tact cen­tre that also of­fers a full range of ser­vices, in­clud­ing call han­dling, e-mail mar­ket­ing, We­bchat in­ter­ac­tion and so­cial me­dia man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Anil was in­spired by the chief ex­ec­u­tive of the call cen­tre he worked in while be­hind bars.</p>
    <p>“He told me this, ‘Dreams with goals are pos­si­ble. Dreams with­out goals are use­less.’ ”</p>
    <p>Mr Anil then took his Bi­ble and wrote down 42 dreams and goals. He still has the book to­day in his of­fice in Tai Seng.</p>
    <p>He has seen 38 of those dreams come true, in­clud­ing set­ting up his own call cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Agape em­ploys nearly 150 peo­ple, some still serv­ing out their sen­tences, while others are former of­fend­ers, se­nior cit­i­zens or folk ex­pe­ri­enc­ing var­i­ous chal­lenges in their lives. Help­ing th­ese peo­ple turn over a new leaf or have a se­cond chance in life is what keeps Mr Anil go­ing ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>He cer­tainly knows the value of a fresh start, as his own fam­ily – he has two daugh­ters aged 18 and 25 – were will­ing to give him another chance and stand by him af­ter he spent years in jail.</p>
    <p>His ad­vice to others: “We can­not undo a lot of wrongs that we have done. I have done so many wrongs.</p>
    <p>“If you have done some­thing that hurts some­one, be pa­tient. Start seek­ing for­give­ness and rec­on­cil­i­a­tion. We don’t need to make en­e­mies in this world.”</p>
