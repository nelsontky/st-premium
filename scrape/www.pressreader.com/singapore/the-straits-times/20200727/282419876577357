    <p>YAS IS­LAND • Former mid­dleweight cham­pion Robert Whit­taker bounced back to de­feat Dar­ren Till yes­ter­day as UFC’s first “Fight Is­land” drew to a suc­cess­ful close in Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>“My brain is on over­load,” Whit­taker said af­ter throw­ing ev­ery­thing at Eng­land’s Till in a unan­i­mous points win, with all three judges scor­ing 48-47 for the Ki­wi­born Aus­tralian.</p>
    <p>“That fight was so stress­ful,” he added. “I hope the fans and ev­ery­body can ap­pre­ci­ate it be­cause that was one of the most tech­ni­cal fights I’ve ever had.”</p>
    <p>His win brought the cur­tain down on the Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship’s suc­cess­ful ex­cur­sion to the United Arab Emirates cap­i­tal of Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>The 26 sq km Yas Is­land re­sort com­plex was sealed off as the Las Ve­gas-based UFC shielded its fight­ers from the coronaviru­s pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Around 2,500 staff and fight­ers set up camp under strict bio-secure pro­to­cols with con­stant test­ing for Covid-19 be­fore, dur­ing and af­ter ar­rival and then reg­u­lar fol­low-up checks through­out.</p>
    <p>Those who tested pos­i­tive for coronaviru­s were ex­cluded, with the big­gest ca­su­alty be­ing Brazil­ian Gil­bert Burns, who lost his shot at fight­ing Nige­rian-Amer­i­can UFC wel­ter­weight cham­pion Ka­maru Us­man two weeks ago as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old Whit­taker (22-5) said be­fore the con­test that the only thing that wor­ried him was Till’s pow­er­ful left fist, a weapon that had given the man from Liver­pool 10 knock­out vic­to­ries in an 18-2-1 record com­ing into the fight.</p>
    <p>But it was a left el­bow from Till in­stead that put the Aussie on the floor in the first. Whit­taker shook it off quickly and then got down to work, lashing out con­stantly at Till’s lead­ing leg and pick­ing away with jabs.</p>
    <p>By the end, the to­tal strike count was 156-81 to Whit­taker, who landed 52 to Till’s 29 with the Aus­tralian also show­cas­ing su­pe­rior wrestling skills.</p>
    <p>Whit­taker had lost his belt when he was knocked out by Nige­ri­anNew Zealan­der Is­rael Ade­sanya (19-0) in Oc­to­ber.</p>
