    <p>More re­stric­tions will be lifted on key events as Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues on the road to phase three of its re­open­ing, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Wed­dings</p>
    <p>Wed­ding re­cep­tions will soon be al­lowed at Hous­ing Board (HDB) com­mon ar­eas man­aged by town coun­cils, such as void decks.</p>
    <p>MOH said the re­cep­tions must be or­gan­ised by a pro­fes­sional wed­ding or­gan­iser or com­pany pro­vid­ing re­lated ser­vices, and the Sin­ga­pore Malay Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try (SMCCI) will help to fa­cil­i­tate such re­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of their eth­nic­ity, cou­ples and wed­ding or­gan­is­ers will need to first sub­mit their event de­tails to SMCCI and ob­tain a let­ter of ac­knowl­edge­ment. They can do so from Nov 9.</p>
    <p>When that is done, they can pro­ceed to sub­mit their ap­pli­ca­tions to the town coun­cil.</p>
    <p>MOH stressed that the max­i­mum num­ber that can at­tend a wed­ding re­cep­tion is 100 peo­ple – in­clud­ing the cou­ple but ex­clud­ing ven­dors – and that safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures will con­tinue to ap­ply.</p>
    <p>More de­tails will be avail­able on http://www.smcci.org.sg/wed­ding from Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Live per­for­mances</p>
    <p>From Nov 1, live per­for­mances can re­sume at des­ig­nated venues, with up to two zones that each have a max­i­mum of 50 peo­ple in the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>MOH said safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures such as lim­its on the num­ber of pro­duc­tion crew and per­form­ers who can be un­masked, and safe dis­tanc­ing on stage, back­stage, be­tween the per­form­ers and au­di­ence, and among the au­di­ence, must con­tinue to be ob­served.</p>
    <p>More de­tails will be re­leased by the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth and the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Work-re­lated events</p>
    <p>From to­mor­row, in-per­son workre­lated events will be al­lowed to take place at third-party venues.</p>
    <p>Since Sept 28, such events, which in­clude con­fer­ences and an­nual gen­eral meet­ings of or­gan­i­sa­tions, have been al­lowed at work­places and in busi­nesses’ own premises.</p>
    <p>MOH said the events at third­party venues will have a cap of 50 peo­ple at each event, and be sub­ject to the poli­cies of the own­ers of the premises.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that Sin­ga­pore has come a long way since the cir­cuit breaker was in­tro­duced, the min­istry said: “The jour­ney ahead may be long, but with the co­op­er­a­tion of ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing busi­nesses, sci­en­tists, front-line work­ers and the gen­eral pub­lic, we are con­fi­dent of tran­sit­ing smoothly to phase three and be­yond, emerg­ing stronger from this ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
