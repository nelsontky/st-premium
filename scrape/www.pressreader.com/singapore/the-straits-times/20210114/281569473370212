        <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme is kick­ing into high gear, as it ex­pands its scope and in­creases its pace, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said yes­ter­day. Eight vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres will be set up by the end of next month, and the pace of vac­ci­na­tion will speed up from this week, with close to 2,800 vac­ci­nated on Tues­day alone.</p>
        <p>Sin­ga­pore’s vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme is kick­ing into high gear, as it ex­pands its scope and in­creases its pace, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said yes­ter­day.</p>
        <p>Eight vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres will be set up by the end of next month, in­clud­ing two cen­tres at Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 4 and Raf­fles City Con­ven­tion Cen­tre that are al­ready op­er­a­tional, as well as two more at the former Hong Kah Sec­ondary School and Wood­lands Galaxy Com­mu­nity Club, which will be­gin run­ning next week.</p>
        <p>Another four cen­tres will be ready next month, and more cen­tres will be pro­gres­sively opened as Sin­ga­pore ex­pands its vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, added Mr Gan, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
        <p>Shots will also be given at poly­clin­ics and gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clin­ics, as well as at health­care in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
        <p>Speak­ing to re­porters dur­ing a visit to Kwong Wai Shiu Hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, Mr Gan said the pace of vac­ci­na­tion is be­ing ramped up from this week, with close to 2,800 vac­ci­nated on Tues­day alone.</p>
        <p>More than 6,200 peo­ple here have re­ceived their first doses of the Covid-19 vac­cine so far, and this fig­ure is ex­pected to rise sub­stan­tially in the com­ing weeks.</p>
        <p>“We are plan­ning to con­tinue to ex­pand the scope of vac­ci­na­tion and to in­crease the pace of vac­ci­na­tion even­tu­ally to cover the whole pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
        <p>Mr Gan and task force co-chair, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, also re­ceived their first dose of the Covid-19 vac­cine yes­ter­day.</p>
        <p>Mr Wong also an­nounced that the el­derly will start re­ceiv­ing their Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions from this month. The Gov­ern­ment had pre­vi­ously an­nounced that se­niors aged 70 and above would start get­ting jabs from next month.</p>
        <p>Letters will be sent out to in­form the el­derly of when they can make book­ings for their vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
        <p>Since Sin­ga­pore kicked off its vac­ci­na­tion drive on Dec 30, vac­cines have been ad­min­is­tered to health­care work­ers in public and pri­vate health­care in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
        <p>Front-line work­ers, in­clud­ing those at air­ports and sea ports, as well as swab­bers and work­ers in com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties, are also be­ing vac­ci­nated.</p>
        <p>Letters will be pro­gres­sively is­sued to other Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents when their turn to be vac­ci­nated comes. Mr Wong said this ex­pan­sion of the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme will be timed to­gether with the ar­rival of vac­cine ship­ments.</p>
        <p>Mr Gan urged Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents to go for the vac­ci­na­tion when they are of­fered one, stress­ing that it will col­lec­tively pro­vide pro­tec­tion against the coro­n­avirus to the whole pop­u­la­tion if a high vac­ci­na­tion rate is achieved.</p>
        <p>“This, in turn, will al­low us to re­cover from the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic more quickly. It will al­low our econ­omy to re­cover faster, it will also al­low us to re­sume our com­mu­nity ac­tiv­i­ties faster,” he said.</p>
        <p>If all goes to plan, Sin­ga­pore will have enough vac­cines to vac­ci­nate every­one by the third quar­ter of this year.</p>
        <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine – the only one ap­proved here to date – re­quires two in­jec­tions, given 21 days apart. Sin­ga­pore is ex­pect­ing more vac­cine de­liv­er­ies in the next few months, in­clud­ing from Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy firm Moderna and China’s Si­no­vac.</p>
        <p>The Si­no­vac vac­cine has yet to be ap­proved, said Mr Gan. The Moderna vac­cine, which has a sim­i­lar ef­fi­cacy rate as Pfizer’s, is un­der re­view, Mr Wong said.</p>
        <p>Vol­un­teers will be trained to help se­niors make online book­ings via a book­ing sys­tem, and in­for­ma­tion in dif­fer­ent lan­guages will be given out at Hous­ing Board es­tates.... Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs Sin­ga­pore’s multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19, said se­niors will be in­vited to go to a poly­clinic, Public Health Pre­pared­ness Clinic or vac­ci­na­tion cen­tre near­est to them for their jab. The book­ing sys­tem is re­quired to avoid a wastage of vac­cines, where the jabs are pre­pared but no one is there to re­ceive them, added Mr Wong.</p>
        <p>Se­niors will get help to make book­ings for their Covid-19 jabs as the Gov­ern­ment steps up its roll-out of the vac­cine, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong.</p>
        <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs Sin­ga­pore’s multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19, an­nounced yes­ter­day that the el­derly will start re­ceiv­ing their shots from later this month.</p>
        <p>Letters will be sent out to in­form them when they can make book­ings for their vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
        <p>Vol­un­teers will be trained to help se­niors make online book­ings via a book­ing sys­tem, and in­for­ma­tion in dif­fer­ent lan­guages will be given out at Hous­ing Board es­tates.</p>
        <p>“This process will take a bit of time. So, we will also step up our out­reach and en­gage­ment ef­forts, par­tic­u­larly to the el­derly across all our HDB es­tates, to let them know what this is about... and also to help them with the book­ing be­cause not ev­ery­body will be fa­mil­iar with the IT sys­tem,” Mr Wong said.</p>
        <p>The Gov­ern­ment had pre­vi­ously an­nounced that se­niors aged 70 and above would start get­ting jabs from next month, but this has been brought for­ward.</p>
        <p>Mr Wong said se­niors will be in­vited to go to a poly­clinic, Public Health Pre­pared­ness Clinic or vac­ci­na­tion cen­tre near­est to them for their jab.</p>
        <p>The book­ing sys­tem is re­quired to avoid a wastage of vac­cines, where the jabs are pre­pared but no one is there to re­ceive them, added Mr Wong, who spoke to the me­dia af­ter re­ceiv­ing his Pfiz­erBioN­Tech jab at Kwong Wai Shiu Hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day.</p>
        <p>Af­ter the el­derly, vac­cines will be pro­gres­sively made avail­able to other seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
        <p>Mr Wong said this will be done in phases, and timed to­gether with the ar­rival of vac­cine ship­ments.</p>
        <p>“We do ex­pect a sig­nif­i­cant ramp-up from now on­wards, and once again, we would en­cour­age every­one to step for­ward, be vac­ci­nated when you are of­fered the chance to be vac­ci­nated,” he added.</p>
        <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health said res­i­dents and clients in the com­mu­nity care sec­tor will also pro­gres­sively be vac­ci­nated. Nurs­ing homes have be­gun en­gag­ing res­i­dents and their next of kin on the vac­ci­na­tions, added the min­istry.</p>
        <p>Sin­ga­pore has about 80 nurs­ing homes, hous­ing some 16,000 res­i­dents.</p>
        <p>More de­tails on the vac­ci­na­tion for se­niors will be pro­vided later.</p>
        <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise be­gan on Dec 30. Since then, more than 6,200 peo­ple have re­ceived the vac­cine.</p>
        <p>Eight vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres will be set up by the end of next month. Two cen­tres – at Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 4 and Raf­fles City Con­ven­tion Cen­tre – are al­ready op­er­a­tional.</p>
        <p>In a Face­book post, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said vac­ci­na­tion for air crew and front-line air­port work­ers be­gan at T4 yes­ter­day, and for ma­rine pi­lots, crew and work­ers who have to go on board ships, at Raf­fles City.</p>
        <p>The work­ers were vac­ci­nated in small groups as an “op­er­a­tional warm-up” be­fore full-scale oper­a­tions next week, Mr Ong said.</p>
        <p>“I will be at T4 with the CEOs of key avi­a­tion com­pa­nies next Mon­day to ex­plain the sig­nif­i­cance of this ex­er­cise,” he added.</p>
