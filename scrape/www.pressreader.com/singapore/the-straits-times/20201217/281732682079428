    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has urged the pub­lic to ex­er­cise “ex­treme cau­tion” and avoid meet­ing el­derly peo­ple over Christ­mas, but he stopped short of can­celling plans to let house­holds mix dur­ing the hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>“We can cel­e­brate it sen­si­bly, but we have to be ex­tremely cau­tious in the way we be­have,” Mr John­son told Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, ad­ding that the gov­ern­ment does not want to “crim­i­nalise peo­ple’s long-made plans”.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic must “ex­er­cise a high de­gree of per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity” and “avoid con­tact with el­derly peo­ple wher­ever pos­si­ble”, he added.</p>
    <p>As many as three house­holds will be able to gather to­gether for five days be­tween Dec 23 and 27 in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters have faced grow­ing de­mands to re­think this ap­proach, with doc­tors con­cerned that the re­lax­ation will lead to a spike in cases, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and deaths.</p>
    <p>One Cabi­net min­is­ter sug­gested it was up to peo­ple to make up their own minds about what pre­cau­tions to take, and said some may want to wait for Easter to gather with their fam­ily, given the risk to the el­derly and the vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Af­ter im­pos­ing the most oner­ous re­stric­tions in peace­time his­tory, Mr John­son is keen to avoid be­com­ing the prime min­is­ter who cancelled Christ­mas, even though Bri­tain has the sixth-worst of­fi­cial Covid-19 death toll in the world, with more than 65,000 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Hous­ing Sec­re­tary Robert Jen­rick said yes­ter­day that it was for peo­ple to make up their own minds, and they should use com­mon sense when mak­ing Christ­mas plans.</p>
    <p>He told BBC TV he had changed his mind about vis­it­ing his own par­ents, both in their 80s, and would wait for them to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>“Easter can be the new Christ­mas for some peo­ple,” Mr Jen­rick told Sky News.</p>
    <p>“We all need to use our own per­sonal judg­ment think­ing about our own fam­i­lies, whether we have par­tic­u­larly el­derly or clin­i­cally vul­ner­a­ble rel­a­tives who might be round the Christ­mas ta­ble,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Think­ing of some of the ex­am­ples we can see in­ter­na­tion­ally – like Thanks­giv­ing, for ex­am­ple, where lots of peo­ple com­ing to­gether did have con­se­quences af­ter the event.”</p>
    <p>Mr John­son has faced grow­ing de­mands to re­think his ap­proach over Christ­mas af­ter the surge in cases, par­tic­u­larly in Lon­don and south-east Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters were also set to re­view tier al­lo­ca­tions across Eng­land by yes­ter­day’s end, with an an­nounce­ment ex­pected today.</p>
    <p>Lon­don and sur­round­ing parts of south-east Eng­land moved into the strictest tier 3 yes­ter­day, ear­lier than planned, af­ter a spike in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The high­est tier means that the­atres, pubs and restau­rants are closed, but shops are not. Peo­ple can­not so­cialise with any­one not from their house­hold or sup­port bub­ble, but can meet in groups of up to six in pub­lic places out­side.</p>
    <p>But with eat­ing and drink­ing es­tab­lish­ments told to close, young rev­ellers packed nightlife ar­eas of the cap­i­tal Lon­don on Tues­day night to party up to the dead­line.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) yes­ter­day urged fam­i­lies in Europe to wear face masks dur­ing Christ­mas and year-end gath­er­ings, as it warned of a “fur­ther resur­gence” of Covid-19 early next year.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions agency said peo­ple should not un­der­es­ti­mate “the im­por­tance of your de­ci­sions” and en­cour­aged ex­tra pre­cau­tion for hol­i­day gath­er­ings, even within the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>If pos­si­ble, the WHO said, cel­e­bra­tions should be held outdoors and “par­tic­i­pants should wear masks and main­tain phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing”.</p>
    <p>In an­other devel­op­ment, a to­tal of 137,897 peo­ple in Bri­tain have been vac­ci­nated in the past week, Mr Nad­him Za­hawi, the min­is­ter in charge of vac­cine de­ploy­ment, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has agreed to spend £3.7 bil­lion (S$6.64 bil­lion) on Covid-19 vac­cines, the Na­tional Au­dit Of­fice (NAO) said yes­ter­day. The gov­ern­ment has agreed on sup­ply deals for 357 mil­lion doses of seven dif­fer­ent can­di­date shots.</p>
    <p>The NAO said the busi­ness min­istry had signed firm deals for five of the vac­cines, in­clud­ing the Pfizer-BioNTech shot which is be­ing rolled out, as well as those from Ox­ford-As­traZeneca, France’s Val­neva, No­vavax and Moderna.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain also has deals in prin­ci­ple for Sanofi-Glax­oSmithK­line’s vac­cine as well as John­son & John­son’s can­di­date.</p>
