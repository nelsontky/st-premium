    <p>mid­dle-weight bike, BMW ap­pears to be rais­ing the bar.</p>
    <p>While some may be tempted to badge the 900 XR as a mini BMW S1000 XR, do­ing so is like com­par­ing ap­ples and or­anges.</p>
    <p>The 1000 XR has a 999cc in-line four-cylin­der en­gine, while the 900 XR has an 895cc par­al­lel-twin en­gine. The lat­ter is less in­tim­i­dat­ing and will ap­peal to more rid­ers. And with a price tag that starts at $33,800, the 900 XR is also more af­ford­able than the S1000, which costs $46,500.</p>
    <p>The 900 XR’s ri­val is the Yamaha Tracer 900. Both are road-go­ing mo­tor­cy­cles that can ven­ture far while of­fer­ing taller sus­pen­sion travel, al­though the six-speed liq­uid-cooled 900 XR is a wee bit heav­ier at 219kg when it is fully fu­elled.</p>
    <p>I am 1.78m and my feet rested flat on the ground while strad­dling the 900 XR. I main­tained an up­right rid­ing pos­ture and com­fort­ably reached the wide dirt­bike han­dle­bars with easily ac­ces­si­ble switches.</p>
    <p>It may look like a dual-pur­pose mo­tor­cy­cle, but the 900 XR is made more for the tar­mac, with 17-inch wheels and grippy road-bi­ased tyres. But it takes time to get used to its rel­a­tive tall­ness dur­ing cor­ner­ing.</p>
    <p>On pa­per, t he three-cylin­der Yamaha Tracer has 113bhp, higher than the 900 XR’s 105bhp. But the BMW’s 92Nm of torque beats the Yamaha’s 87.5Nm.</p>
    <p>The 900 XR’s torque rises from as low as 4,000rpm, with 87Nm avail­able be­tween 4,500 and 8,500rpm.</p>
    <p>That means the bike, geared for a top speed of over 200kmh, is al­ways ready to pull away hard and fast in the city. At higher speeds, its ad­justable wind­screen comes in handy.</p>
    <p>But shift­ing up from first to sec­ond gear felt notchy – a small is­sue as I easily adapted by us­ing the clutch lever to ease the first-to-sec­ond gear tran­si­tion. Af­ter that, its quick­shifter sys­tem re­quires just a gen­tle tug to en­gage the next higher gear with­out clos­ing the throt­tle.</p>
    <p>The 900 XR comes with a lot of elec­tronic wizardry to make rid­ing en­joy­able and safe. The base model has Blue­tooth con­nec­tiv­ity, key­less ig­ni­tion, quick­shift sys­tem and LED head­lights which light up corners dur­ing a turn.</p>
    <p>The bike is also equipped with flaw­less anti-lock brakes, se­lectable rid­ing modes and ad­justable trac­tion con­trol.</p>
    <p>A bonus for me was the Dy­namic ESA, which came with the full-spec model I test rode. It is an elec­tronic sus­pen­sion which “reads” road sur­faces and tunes the damp­ing needed while on the move – a fea­ture found in lux­ury cars.</p>
