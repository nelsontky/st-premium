    <p>CRU­CIAL VISIT</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>TOKYO Ja­pan and China agreed yes­ter­day to con­tinue com­mu­ni­ca­tions on is­sues around the East China Sea where the two coun­tries are in dis­pute, Ja­panese For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi said.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi was speak­ing af­ter a meet­ing with his Chi­nese coun­ter­part, Mr Wang Yi, in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>At a joint press brief­ing later, Mr Wang said he would like to make the East China Sea “the sea of peace” through co­op­er­a­tion with Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries also agreed to ease re­stric­tions on busi­ness trav­els im­posed in the wake of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic by the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang’s visit marks the first such high-level trip since Ja­pan picked a new leader in Septem­ber and comes amid mount­ing con­cerns over Bei­jing’s grow­ing as­sertive­ness in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese min­is­ter could pay a cour­tesy call on Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, who has so far sought to bal­ance Ja­pan’s deep eco­nomic re­liance on China with ad­dress­ing se­cu­rity wor­ries.</p>
    <p>While Mr Suga has steered clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by the US, Ja­pan’s ally, he has also moved to counter its in­flu­ence by deep­en­ing ties with Aus­tralia and mak­ing his first over­seas trip to Viet­nam and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment has also en­cour­aged its com­pa­nies to di­ver­sify their sup­ply chains and re­duce their re­liance on China by bring­ing pro­duc­tion home or mov­ing it to South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“There are var­i­ous pend­ing is­sues be­tween the two coun­tries, so through high-level meet­ings, it is im­por­tant to reach so­lu­tions to each is­sue one by one,” Mr Motegi told re­porters on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is also get­ting closer with Bei­jing through trade agree­ments. Ear­lier this month, China signed the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship with another 14 economies, in­clud­ing US al­lies Ja­pan and South Korea, but the US was not party to the deal.</p>
    <p>It was the first mul­ti­lat­eral trade deal for China, the first bi­lat­eral tar­iff re­duc­tion ar­range­ment be­tween Ja­pan and China, and the first time China, Ja­pan and South Korea have been in a sin­gle free­trade bloc.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang will fly to South Korea af­ter Ja­pan, for talks that will in­clude North Korea.</p>
    <p>“For China, this visit is im­por­tant for re-plan­ning a strat­egy to­wards the two US al­lies un­der the coming</p>
    <p>Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Toshiya Takahashi, an in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions ex­pert at Shoin Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said Mr Wang’s diplo­macy could help lay the ground­work for a tri­lat­eral sum­mit with Ja­pan and South Korea to push for­ward trade part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has said Bei­jing would “ac­tively con­sider” sign­ing up for another re­gional free-trade pact, the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP).</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, a key mem­ber state of the pact and next year’s chair, aims to ex­pand the CPTPP, po­ten­tially paving the way for China to join af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump with­drew the US from the pact.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi said last Fri­day that China’s ex­pres­sion of in­ter­ests was “wel­come”, but it needs fur­ther as­sess­ment in ac­cor­dance with the pact’s rules.</p>
    <p>For China, this visit is im­por­tant for re-plan­ning a strat­egy to­wards the two US al­lies (Ja­pan and South Korea) un­der the coming Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
