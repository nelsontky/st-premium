    <p>NEW YORK • Hun­dreds of New York Uni­ver­sity (NYU) stu­dents and staff waited in line out­side a white tent on Tues­day for coro­n­avirus test­ing ahead of some classes re­sum­ing early next month, a scene ex­pected to un­fold on many US cam­puses in com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>NYU is test­ing stu­dents who have cho­sen in-per­son learn­ing, with classes for un­der­grad­u­ates be­gin­ning on Sept 2. The uni­ver­sity is also giv­ing stu­dents the op­tions of re­mote learn­ing or a blended pro­gramme be­tween the two.</p>
    <p>Separately on Tues­day, the Uni­ver­sity of Notre Dame said it would move to on­line in­struc­tion for at least the next two weeks and could move to shut down its cam­pus en­tirely.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came as uni­ver­si­ties across the coun­try are strug­gling to con­trol fast-grow­ing out­breaks among re­turn­ing stu­dents. On Mon­day, the Uni­ver­sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill moved all its un­der­grad­u­ate classes on­line. And Michi­gan State Uni­ver­sity shifted its re­open­ing plans, telling stu­dents not to re­turn for the start of classes in two weeks.</p>
    <p>New York, once the US epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic, has an in­fec­tion rate below 1 per cent, a bench­mark for restart­ing cer­tain ac­tiv­i­ties with so­cial dis­tanc­ing and mask wear­ing.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the US, col­leges, sec­ondary and pri­mary schools are grap­pling with the new re­al­ity of whether to re­open in the mid­dle of a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>At some col­leges, a coro­n­avirus test site is the first place stu­dents must go to when they ar­rive on cam­pus be­fore head­ing to their dor­mi­to­ries. They may not en­ter any other cam­pus build­ings un­til the re­sult comes back neg­a­tive, which could take sev­eral days in some cases.</p>
    <p>The Uni­ver­sity of Notre Dame re­ported 80 pos­i­tive re­sults on Mon­day, tak­ing the to­tal num­ber of con­firmed cases to 147 since Aug 3, ac­cord­ing to the uni­ver­sity’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The re­sults from 418 tests rep­re­sented a pos­i­tiv­ity rate of 19 per cent with over­all pos­i­tiv­ity around 16 per cent since Aug 3.</p>
    <p>Be­fore re­turn­ing to cam­pus, all stu­dents were tested – only 33 of nearly 12,000 were pos­i­tive, a rate of only 0.28 per cent.</p>
    <p>A uni­ver­sity spokesman said a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of the con­firmed cases were con­nected to two of­f­cam­pus par­ties where stu­dents, mostly se­niors, did not wear masks or prac­tise so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to mov­ing classes on­line, Notre Dame will close public spa­ces on cam­pus and re­strict dorms to res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>In the Ok­la­homa uni­ver­sity town of Still­wa­ter, the city coun­cil met on Mon­day night to dis­cuss its re­sponse to vi­ral videos show­ing crowded bars and clubs near Ok­la­homa State Uni­ver­sity, where in­per­son classes be­gan on Aug 17.</p>
    <p>The videos emerged as Mayor Will Joyce op­posed the an­nual Weed­stock mu­sic fes­ti­val set to be­gin to­day out­side the town, ex­pected to at­tract thou­sands.</p>
    <p>Schools in parts of the coun­try that have a coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion pos­i­tiv­ity rate of more than 10 per cent would be bet­ter off eas­ing into the new aca­demic year with vir­tual class­rooms, said top US in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert An­thony Fauci.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci said pri­mary and sec­ondary schools as a de­fault po­si­tion should try and re­open for the psy­cho­log­i­cal health of chil­dren, but no sin­gle ap­proach should ap­ply to ev­ery school in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The US has more than five mil­lion cases of con­firmed Covid-19 cases, the high­est in the world, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally, with more than 170,000 re­ported deaths.</p>
    <p>Many col­leges have plans to test stu­dents who are com­ing back to cam­pus, even if classes are all re­mote.</p>
    <p>Test­ing avail­abil­ity on cam­puses will vary. NYU plans to test a ran­dom sam­pling of stu­dents, fac­ulty and staff each week of the au­tumn se­mes­ter.</p>
    <p>Florida State Uni­ver­sity has set an “as­pi­ra­tional goal” of giv­ing Covid-19 tests to all fac­ulty, staff and stu­dents re­turn­ing to cam­pus.</p>
    <p>North­west­ern Uni­ver­sity in Evanston, Illi­nois, said all stu­dents liv­ing in res­i­dence halls will be tested upon ar­rival and all stu­dents par­tak­ing in any in-per­son learn­ing must be tested be­fore the start of the aca­demic quar­ter on Sept 21.</p>
