    <p>Ger­many will breathe a col­lec­tive sigh of re­lief on Oct 31 when the new Ber­lin air­port fi­nally opens. It will be noth­ing short of a night­mare com­ing to an end.</p>
    <p>Haunted by nu­mer­ous con­struc­tion trou­bles, fre­quent changes of man­age­ment and re­peated post­pone­ments to the open­ing, the air­port had be­come some­thing of a joke. Ger­man engi­neer­ing prow­ess, oft vaunted as the world’s best, be­came fod­der for taunts in Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>As a fit­ting end to this al­most 15-year con­struc­tion or­deal, the open­ing now falls in the midst of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sar­cas­tic com­men­ta­tors are al­ready ask­ing whether the air­port is nec­es­sary at all. Pas­sen­ger num­bers are in fact down so dras­ti­cally that they could eas­ily be han­dled by the old Tegel air­port.</p>
    <p>Tegel, bet­ter known by its code TXL, had been built in the 1970s when West Ber­lin was still a walledin city. Af­ter uni­fi­ca­tion and the mov­ing of the Ger­man cap­i­tal from Bonn to Ber­lin, it quickly be­came clear that the city would need a mod­ern air­port able to han­dle in­creas­ing air traf­fic.</p>
    <p>In the early 1990s, Ber­lin had four air­ports – Tegel, Tem­pel­hof, Ga­tow and Schone­feld – scat­tered over a city that once was di­vided into four sec­tors, each con­trolled by one of the oc­cu­py­ing forces.</p>
    <p>For a city shy of four mil­lion people, this air travel clutter had to end.</p>
    <p>Plan­ning of the new air­port started in 1996, af­ter a site was ear­marked next to the dated former East Ger­man hub in Schone­feld, a Ber­lin sub­urb.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion be­gan in 2006 and the open­ing was orig­i­nally sched­uled for Novem­ber 2011. How­ever, con­stant trou­ble with the smoke con­trol sys­tem and thou­sands of other tech­ni­cal prob­lems moved the of­fi­cial launch of the air­port al­most ev­ery year fur­ther down the road.</p>
    <p>BER, short­hand for what will be the new Ber­lin-Bran­den­burg Willy Brandt Air­port, saw ex­ec­u­tives come and go. Some of them hired like foot­ball coaches to save a strug­gling team from be­ing rel­e­gated to a lower di­vi­sion. Ev­ery new ex­ec­u­tive brought in a new crew, which fur­ther en­hanced the chaos.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Mr En­gel­bert Lutke Dal­drup took over as chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer. A calm and sea­soned con­struc­tion ex­pert, he re­vealed in an interview with The Straits Times his se­cret for suc­cess with the project: “I stopped chang­ing plans. I or­dered that we will stick to what we have and that I won’t al­low any mod­i­fi­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>He put a hard stop to the con­stant in­tro­duc­tion of new ideas and adap­ta­tions that had, in the past, led to an avalanche of con­se­quen­tial changes. As a re­sult, the new air­port of 2020 may not re­flect the ab­so­lute lat­est in air­port tech­nol­ogy, but it will at least work.</p>
    <p>Dry runs have been un­der way since July, when batches of 400 vol­un­teers from the gen­eral pub­lic would show up ev­ery Tues­day and</p>
    <p>Thurs­day for a user sim­u­la­tion of a reg­u­lar busi­ness day at BER.</p>
    <p>Pick­ing up suit­cases, push­ing strollers, queue­ing at the check-in coun­ters, fig­ur­ing out dis­play boards and find­ing their way to the gates in the new ter­mi­nal, the er­satz pas­sen­gers – masked and ad­vised to keep their dis­tance from one another – put the air­port’s op­er­a­tions to the test in real time.</p>
    <p>For BER, the Covid-19 pan­demic may even turn out to be a bless­ing in disguise. Pas­sen­ger num­bers in Ber­lin are cur­rently down to a quar­ter of the usual 110,00 trav­ellers land­ing at and de­part­ing from one of the Ber­lin air­ports.</p>
    <p>On open­ing day at the end of this month, the new air­port will not see a huge rush of pas­sen­gers but only mod­est num­bers. With scores of ob­servers just wait­ing for the next glitch to sur­face, this eases the pres­sure some­what.</p>
    <p>The slow start will also mit­i­gate one of the key crit­i­cisms – that the air­port is way too small to serve all the pas­sen­gers that are now redi­rected from Tegel in the north of the city to BER in the south. Since no­body knows when pas­sen­ger num­bers will pick up to preCovid-19 lev­els again, this de­bate also has died down.</p>
    <p>The hope that the air­port soon would be­come a ma­jor Euro­pean hub is no longer. Per­spec­tive plans of new ter­mi­nals to ex­pand the air­port will not be re­ferred to any time soon.</p>
    <p>“All the ar­rivals and de­par­tures of one day fit on a sin­gle dis­play,” said BER op­er­a­tions manager Pa­trick Muller, with vis­i­bly mixed feel­ings.</p>
    <p>While glad that the project is fi­nally see­ing the light of day, he ad­mit­ted: “Of course this is not on the level of air­ports in Dubai or Is­tan­bul, but BER will be mod­ern and well work­ing.”</p>
    <p>The pro­tracted tur­bu­lence in the build­ing of the BER has, how­ever, left a mark.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, other huge con­struc­tion projects like the Stuttgart sta­tion and the phil­har­monic hall in Ham­burg have also proved to be dif­fi­cult to re­alise, ei­ther be­cause of tech­no­log­i­cal hur­dles, costs that go over­board or mas­sive ob­jec­tions by cit­i­zen ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>The new Ber­lin air­port is now €4 bil­lion (S$6.4 bil­lion) over bud­get (the to­tal is over €6 bil­lion) – and this is not even the end of the line.</p>
    <p>With rev­enues un­der wa­ter be­cause of Covid-19, it will take many more years until the new air­port may have com­pen­sated for the bil­lions that piled up due to the pro­longed con­struc­tion. “I ex­pect it will take as long as maybe three or four years for us to reach the pre­co­ro­n­avirus level of busi­ness,” said Mr Lutke Dal­drup. More­over, BER has al­ready asked for €300 mil­lion more of tax­payer money to keep the new air­port afloat.</p>
    <p>While BER will even­tu­ally cel­e­brate its open­ing, the days of Tegel are num­bered. The air­port, shaped like a hexagon and easy to ac­cess, is loved by many Ber­lin­ers. With its dis­tinct patina, it re­flects the time when life in Ber­lin was cosy and calm.</p>
    <p>A ref­er­en­dum to keep Tegel open even gar­nered the sup­port of a ma­jor­ity of Ber­lin­ers. How­ever, the city gov­ern­ment brushed the vote aside. Lo­cal politi­cians wanted only one air­port that is pres­ti­gious. Now this new air­port just has to de­liver.</p>
