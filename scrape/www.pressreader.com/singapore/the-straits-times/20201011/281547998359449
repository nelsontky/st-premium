    <p>Even now, over a week later, my palms still grow clammy ev­ery time I think about tee­ter­ing on a bungee tower 17 storeys up, toes peek­ing over the edge of the plat­form, dread­ing the plunge into a wide ex­panse of noth­ing­ness.</p>
    <p>Bungee jump­ing has al­ways been on my bucket list – one of those “one day I’ll do it” things that I never ticked off due to cost, fear or both.</p>
    <p>This year, cooped up in Sin­ga­pore by the pan­demic and miss­ing the thrill of edg­ing be­yond my com­fort zone, there seems no bet­ter time to give it a shot.</p>
    <p>I am not alone in this line of thought. Mr Luke John­son, gen­eral man­ager of AJ Hack­ett Sen­tosa, says the in­ter­na­tional bungee op­er­a­tor has seen a shift in con­sumer mind­set since the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are liv­ing in the mo­ment, be­cause they don’t know what is around the cor­ner. They don’t mind spend­ing a bit more to have an ex­pe­ri­ence, tick off the bucket list, get out­doors and live life,” he says.</p>
    <p>Steep dis­counts have helped woo crowds since the Sen­tosa site re­opened in July.</p>
    <p>A bungee jump now costs $69, down from $159 be­fore the pan­demic. The com­pany de­clines to re­veal vis­i­tor num­bers, but says it gets a “high through­put” dur­ing week­ends.</p>
    <p>On the week­day af­ter­noon when The Sun­day Times vis­ited, at least 10 brave souls have taken the plunge.</p>
    <p>If a gut-wrench­ing, soul­cleans­ing, scream-your-way-down ac­tiv­ity sounds too in­tense, the sky bridge is en­ter­tain­ment enough – like a teaser be­fore the bungee jump, where you can step into a ver­tigo-in­duc­ing glass cube or peer through trans­par­ent floor pan­els to spot j umpers dan­gling by their an­kles be­low.</p>
    <p>This is where dread first sets in. I am no adren­a­line junkie and have a poor track record when it comes to jump­ing off things. Dur­ing swim­ming lessons as a child, I spent weeks gath­er­ing the courage to jump into the pool, gin­gerly pok­ing one foot over the edge, while my class­mates can­non­balled mer­rily into the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>And dur­ing a phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion class i n pri­mary school, I was among the slow­est to per­form a trust fall into the arms of my class­mates.</p>
    <p>So in the week lead­ing up to my jump, I en­gage in all kinds of mental trick­ery to psych my­self up.</p>
    <p>All I have to do is leap for­ward, I tell my­self. The hard­est part will be over in a split sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Alone at home one af­ter­noon, fully aware of how ridicu­lous I look, I imag­ine my an­kles tied and prac­tise jump­ing off a stool. My at­tempt at grace goes nowhere.</p>
    <p>But know­ing the right form is im­por­tant. Div­ing head first al­lows a smooth tran­si­tion into the up­side-down po­si­tion, and keep­ing my chin tucked and arms out­stretched will pre­vent a mouth­ful of wa­ter as I dip into the 3.5m pool be­low.</p>
    <p>Jumpers can de­cide if they want to touch the wa­ter and the crew will ad­just their bungee cord ac­cord­ingly, although a de­ci­sive leap of­fers a much bet­ter chance of fin­ish­ing with a dip.</p>
    <p>Jump mas­ter Izuwan Ha­jis runs me through these tips while his col­league straps me by the an­kles, ty­ing a knot that will tighten when pres­sure is ex­erted. He lets me pick a song and I choose Rust To Gold by Amer­i­can rock band Coun­cil. Count­less times, the up­beat track on my work­out playlist has pushed me to one more rep. To­day, I hope it will help me take the leap.</p>
    <p>I shuf­fle re­luc­tantly to the edge and Mr Izuwan be­gins a count­down, but when he reaches one, my legs re­main frozen.</p>
    <p>I stag­ger to the side and ask for some time to re­group.</p>
    <p>The 47m tower, small i n the bungee j ump­ing world and only one-fifth the height of the Ma­cau tower jump run by the same com­pany, proves too daunt­ing when it be­comes clear there is no bar­rier be­tween me and the curved shore­line of Siloso beach be­low.</p>
    <p>I al­most turn tail and run – and I would not be the only one. About 1 per cent of peo­ple turn back from the edge, says Mr John­son.</p>
    <p>Un­like tan­dem sky­div­ing or rid­ing a roller­coaster, the thrill – and ter­ror – comes from be­ing fully in con­trol of your ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“Fear is part of the process. Once you get over the hur­dle, it’s just an amazing feel­ing,” adds Mr John­son, who has more than 300 jumps un­der his belt.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a few min­utes of self-talk, I gear up for a sec­ond at­tempt, this time count­ing down aloud with the crew.</p>
    <p>Once again, it is a false start. My trai­tor­ous legs refuse to budge. The track loops once more. I have def­i­nitely been here longer than five min­utes, the av­er­age du­ra­tion it takes for most to make the leap. I be­gin to feel like I will never get off this tower.</p>
    <p>A crowd of beach­go­ers of­fers un­ex­pected moral sup­port.</p>
    <p>“There are peo­ple be­low cheer­ing for you,” says Mr Izuwan, still grip­ping my hand en­cour­ag­ingly. Per­haps this is the boost I need. Fi­nally, on my third at­tempt, I push off.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing the adren­a­line rush of travel? You can still get your highs on a bungee jump or giant swing at AJ Hack­ett Sen­tosa</p>
    <p>The world is a mud­dle of teal and green and sand. I hear peo­ple whoop­ing and try to spot them but ev­ery­thing is topsy-turvy.</p>
    <p>Then the re­coil hits. I hur­tle up­wards and sud­denly find my­self fall­ing once again, al­most as thrilling as the first time.</p>
    <p>In­deed, my fear has van­ished. The hard part is over and now I can fi­nally en­joy the heart-in-mouth feel­ing, more sat­is­fy­ing be­cause I have earned it. The free fall lasts for only about two to three sec­onds but feels like a glo­ri­ous eter­nity.</p>
    <p>As it turns out, I did not pro­pel my­self far enough dur­ing my jump and miss the wa­ter by a few inches. No mat­ter. The af­ter­noon still ends on a high.</p>
    <p>I play Rust To Gold again on my way home and think about how we re­late songs to mile­stones and sea­sons.</p>
    <p>Now, ir­re­versibly, it has be­come my an­them of em­brac­ing new ex­pe­ri­ences and let­ting go of fear.</p>
