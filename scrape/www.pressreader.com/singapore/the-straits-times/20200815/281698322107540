    <p>The Min­istry of Education will con­tinue to fo­cus on education as a so­cial lev­eller, as well as work to en­sure that schools can con­tinue to op­er­ate even if the Covid-19 pan­demic rages on, said Education Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong.</p>
    <p>“One pri­or­ity for my team and I is to en­sure that education re­mains an ef­fec­tive so­cial lev­eller. And the re­sources that we pro­vide to our schools should re­flect this im­por­tant ethos,” he said.</p>
    <p>But the on­go­ing pan­demic has also raised is­sues that the min­istry will have to think about: How to al­low stu­dents to re­sume ac­tiv­i­ties out­side their class­rooms, how ex­ams will be con­ducted if the pan­demic con­tin­ues, and how to re­spond if there are un­ex­pected waves of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“We are ap­ply­ing our minds to see what ad­just­ments are needed,” he said. “As­sum­ing that the pan­demic will be with us for a long pe­riod of time, per­haps a year or even longer... we must stay vig­i­lant, but at the same time, en­sure that learn­ing is not com­pro­mised.”</p>
    <p>Be­yond aca­demic matters and classes, ex­tra-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties are an im­por­tant part of the learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, he noted.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong was speaking to re­porters at Mar­sil­ing Sec­ondary School yes­ter­day, in his first me­dia doorstop since the Cab­i­net reshuf­fle two weeks back. It is his third school visit in his new post as Education Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­liki Os­man, who is Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Education and For­eign Af­fairs, was also present.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the visit, Mr Wong spoke to stu­dents in some classes, and toured the school grounds.</p>
    <p>He also made a stop at the school’s ver­ti­cal veg­etable gar­den, which is used in an ap­plied learn­ing pro­gramme to teach stu­dents about en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues such as food sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents grow and har­vest crops such as kangkong. They do­nate the veg­eta­bles to lo­cal char­i­ties and take the left­overs home.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong also said that mak­ing education a so­cial lev­eller will in­volve en­sur­ing that schools “re­main an up­lift­ing force to help stu­dents from more dif­fi­cult back­grounds”.</p>
    <p>These in­clude those who do less well aca­dem­i­cally in schools, as well as stu­dents from less well-off fam­i­lies and those who have spe­cial education needs.</p>
    <p>He noted that the min­istry has been in­vest­ing a lot in the preschool sec­tor to “as­sure chil­dren from these back­grounds that they have a good start in life”.</p>
    <p>“We will see what more we can do to im­prove that sup­port for the stu­dents. But the sup­port is not just fi­nan­cial... it is also about en­gag­ing the par­ents and com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>The Up­lift­ing Pupils in Life and In­spir­ing Fam­i­lies Task­force (Uplift) ini­tia­tives will also play a big role, Mr Wong said. He added that Dr Ma­liki will as­sist him in that area, as well as over­see matters re­lated to the higher learn­ing in­sti­tutes.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Education and So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Sun Xuel­ing will work with the early child­hood and spe­cial education sec­tor, while Min­is­ter of State for Education and Man­power Gan Siow Huang will lend a hand on the Skill­sFu­ture front.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong added: “Our over­ar­ch­ing pri­or­ity for education re­mains the same, and that is to bring out the best in ev­ery stu­dent. We recog­nise that all the chil­dren are dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“Each one has dif­fer­ent gifts, tal­ents, in­ter­ests, ap­ti­tude, so we want to be able to en­gage them so that they can find out what their strengths are, and achieve their fullest po­ten­tial.”</p>
