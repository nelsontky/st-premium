    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Boba Fett (right) is join­ing the Star Wars char­ac­ters who are step­ping out from the back­ground and get­ting their own show.</p>
    <p>Jon Favreau, cre­ator of Dis­ney’s hit tele­vi­sion se­ries The Man­dalo­rian (2019 to present), said on Mon­day that The Book Of Boba Fett will be a stand­alone spin-off se­ries star­ring the clone bounty hunter pre­vi­ously best known for help­ing to cap­ture Han Solo in the sci­encefic­tion saga.</p>
    <p>Favreau told Good Morn­ing Amer­ica that the se­ries, which was teased last week, will de­but on the Dis­ney+ stream­ing ser­vice in De­cem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>“This is sep­a­rate from The Man­dalo­rian Sea­son 3,” Favreau said.</p>
    <p>The Man­dalo­rian, which has proved a huge hit for Dis­ney+, stars Pe­dro Pas­cal as the tit­u­lar char­ac­ter – a bounty hunter sent on a sen­si­tive mis­sion – and fea­tures fan favourite Baby Yoda.</p>
    <p>It is the first live-ac­tion tele­vi­sion se­ries set in the galaxy far, far away that was first seen on screen in the 1977 movie Star Wars.</p>
    <p>The Book Of Boba Fett will star Te­muera Mor­ri­son as Boba Fett and Ming-Na Wen as mer­ce­nary Fen­nec Shand, who both ap­peared in The Man­dalo­rian.</p>
    <p>Mor­ri­son pre­vi­ously played Boba Fett’s father Jango Fett in the Star Wars movie At­tack Of The Clones (2002).</p>
    <p>Boba Fett first ap­peared in The Em­pire Strikes Back (1980), mainly por­trayed by ac­tor Jeremy Bulloch, who died at age 75 last</p>
    <p>Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Favreau said The Book</p>
    <p>Of Boba Fett was an ad­di­tion to the slew of about 10 new Star Wars re­lated tele­vi­sion shows and movies an­nounced by Dis­ney ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>He said the Boba Fett se­ries was held back from that an­nounce­ment be­cause “we didn’t want to spoil the sur­prise”.</p>
    <p>The Book Of Boba Fett will be set in the same time­line as The Man­dalo­rian – shortly af­ter the events de­picted in the 1983 movie The Re­turn Of The Jedi, Favreau said.</p>
