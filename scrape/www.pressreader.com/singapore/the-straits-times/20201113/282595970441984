    <p>There is more than meets the eye at Clas­sic Putian, a shabby corner stall in a Jurong West cof­fee shop where head cook Chang Yue Jie, 35, sur­prises with a few restau­rant-wor­thy dishes.</p>
    <p>For the Deep Fried Squir­rel Style</p>
    <p>Sea Bass ($22 for dine-in; pro­mo­tional price of $20 via GrabFood un­til end-Novem­ber), he dips fresh sea bass that is deboned and scored in his own bat­ter, then deep-fries it twice.</p>
    <p>While the sweet and tangy sauce with onion, pa­paya and pineap­ple that ac­com­pa­nies the dish tastes a tad too much like ketchup, the fish is so crispy, you can hear the crunch as you bite into its skin. You can even eat its tail like a bis­cuit, yet the meat is moist and ten­der.</p>
    <p>The stall has a wide selec­tion of dishes on GrabFood, but some are bet­ter for dine-in.</p>
    <p>The Herbal Bam­boo Prawn is served in a spe­cially crafted bam­boo con­tainer for dine-in cus­tomers. The min­i­mum or­der for dine-in is one serv­ing ($6), while you have to or­der at least two serv­ings ($12) on GrabFood.</p>
    <p>Fresh wa­ter prawns are cooked in su­pe­rior stock made from sim­mer­ing old hens, pork bones and Jin­hua ham. The soup is flavoured with herbal wine made from steep­ing herbs in­clud­ing dang shen (codonop­sis root), chuan gong (Szechuan lo­vage) and dang gui (Chi­nese an­gel­ica) in Hua Tiao wine.</p>
    <p>The stall also serves Fresh Cock­les ($8/$10/$12 for dine-in; $10 on GrabFood). While the cock­les are in­deed fresh, the light soya sauce-based dress­ing is over­whelmed by an avalanche of minced gar­lic.</p>
    <p>The Heng Hua Bee Hoon ($4.50/$7 for dine-in; $5/$8/$12 on GrabFood) is rather bland if not for the sweet­ness of the clams and prawn. But the bee­hoon, pro­duced in Putian, is curly and springier in tex­ture than the type com­monly used here.</p>
    <p>WHERE Stall 8, 01-855, Block 503 Jurong West Av­enue 1</p>
    <p>MRT Lake­side</p>
    <p>OPEN 10.30am to 11pm (dine-in); 10.30am to mid­night (de­liv­ery via GrabFood) TEL 8656-7878</p>
