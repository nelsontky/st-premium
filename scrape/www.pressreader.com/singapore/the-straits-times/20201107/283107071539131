    <p>I have a lot of clothes and cos­tumes from over the years and, in 2004, my fam­ily and I agreed that we would ap­proach the Arts Cen­tre Mel­bourne to see if they were in­ter­ested in hav­ing this stuff.</p>
    <p>They were, so I do­nated ev­ery­thing. If I hit tough times,</p>
    <p>I’ve got noth­ing to sell. It was a great idea and they did the first ex­hi­bi­tion of my clothes in 2005.</p>
    <p>They had to have the man­nequins made re­ally tiny – I’m 5 foot and a whis­per. I re­mem­ber see­ing one cos­tume – this black-winged feather head­dress – and I just kind of marched straight over to it be­cause it wasn’t where I thought it should be and there was this au­di­ble gasp be­cause you couldn’t han­dle things with­out gloves and so on.</p>
    <p>That was the mo­ment I re­alised “these re­ally are not mine any­more”. Tour­ing cos­tumes are work­ers. They’re part of the team. Now they’re in a lovely re­tire­ment cen­tre in my home­town.</p>
