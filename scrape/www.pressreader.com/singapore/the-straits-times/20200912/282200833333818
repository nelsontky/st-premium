    <p>An In­done­sian maid was sen­tenced to four weeks’ jail yes­ter­day over mul­ti­ple counts of theft in­volv­ing cash to­talling more than $1,000 dur­ing the course of four months.</p>
    <p>Rina Ti­laar, 46, who pleaded guilty to three counts of theft, cried be­fore Se­nior Dis­trict Judge Ong Hian Sun, claim­ing that she had been mis­treated.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Mr Chew Ken Wee, 39, em­ployed Rina on Jan 28.</p>
    <p>At the start of her employment, she signed a dec­la­ra­tion form stat­ing that she had about $18 in cash in her pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew also re­mit­ted her monthly salary di­rectly into her In­done­sian bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Fe­bru­ary and April, she stole a coin pouch worth $150 and $500 in cash from Mr Chew’s 66-year-old mother.</p>
    <p>Be­tween March 9 and May 19, Rina stole more than $270 in cash from Mr Chew’s 37-year-old wife.</p>
    <p>Rina also took a $15 card holder and an ez-link card with a stored value of $20 from her.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew no­ticed that cash to­talling $300 was miss­ing from his wal­let be­tween mid-April and May.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean and his wife con­ducted a check of Rina’s be­long­ings when she was out on May 21.</p>
    <p>They found cash to­talling more than $1,200 in­side a coin pouch.</p>
    <p>State Prose­cut­ing Of­fi­cer Mohd Nasri Haron said: “As this amount was sig­nif­i­cantly higher than what the ac­cused had in her de­clared pos­ses­sion, (Mr Chew) there­fore called for po­lice as­sis­tance to re­port the mat­ter.”</p>
    <p>He added that af­ter the po­lice ar­rived, Rina ad­mit­ted that she had stolen the cash and other items from Mr Chew and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The court heard that she com­mit­ted the of­fences when the fam­ily were out on their evening walks.</p>
    <p>For each count of theft, she could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined.</p>
