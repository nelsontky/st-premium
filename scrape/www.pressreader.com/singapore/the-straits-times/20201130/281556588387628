    <p>Many tech com­pa­nies here say it has been dif­fi­cult to se­cure enough top-tier tal­ent to grow their Sin­ga­pore work­force and boost ca­pa­bil­i­ties. Tech.Pass, in­tro­duced ear­lier this month, hopes to ad­dress this is­sue while grow­ing Sin­ga­pore’s tech ecosys­tem. Ap­pli­ca­tions for the Tech.Pass will open in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>When cy­ber pro­tec­tion com­pany Acro­nis wanted to grow the team for its re­search and de­vel­op­ment cen­tre here last year, it tar­geted lo­cals.</p>
    <p>But when it could not hire enough peo­ple with the re­quired knowhow, the Sin­ga­pore-based firm tapped the Tech@SG pro­gramme, which pro­vides for flex­i­ble re­quire­ments for for­eign pro­fes­sion­als to get an Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP).</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, ad­min­is­tered by the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, en­dorses EP ap­pli­ca­tions to the Man­power Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Acro­nis is now eye­ing an­other EDB ini­tia­tive – the Tech.Pass – while hir­ing and train­ing more lo­cals. Un­like an EP, for­eign pro­fes­sion­als with the new work pass are free to choose who they work for.</p>
    <p>“We could def­i­nitely use Tech.Pass to re­cruit the best peo­ple and ex­pand our en­gi­neer­ing team – the new scheme pro­vides cer­tain flex­i­bil­ity to the holder, since it’s not tied to one com­pany,” Acro­nis’ co-founder and tech­nol­ogy pres­i­dent Stanislav Protassov told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Many tech com­pa­nies here like Acro­nis say it has been dif­fi­cult to se­cure enough top-tier tal­ent to grow their Sin­ga­pore work­force and boost ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The EDB says Tech.Pass, an­nounced on Nov 12, is an at­tempt to ad­dress this man­power is­sue while si­mul­ta­ne­ously grow­ing Sin­ga­pore’s tech ecosys­tem and cre­at­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cals.</p>
    <p>The Tech.Pass is valid for two years and can be re­newed once more for an­other two years. Hold­ers of the pass can serve on the board of di­rec­tors of a Sin­ga­pore­based com­pany or be a share­holder or in­vestor in com­pa­nies here. They can also start and op­er­ate a busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for the Tech.Pass will open in Jan­uary, with 500 passes avail­able. Can­di­dates must meet at least two of three cri­te­ria:</p>
    <p>• A last-drawn monthly salary of at least $20,000 in the past year;</p>
    <p>• At least five years of cu­mu­la­tive ex­pe­ri­ence in a lead­ing role in a tech firm with a val­u­a­tion or mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of at least US$500 mil­lion (S$669 mil­lion) or at least US$30 mil­lion fund­ing and be­yond; and</p>
    <p>• At least five years of cu­mu­la­tive ex­pe­ri­ence in a lead­ing role in the de­vel­op­ment of a tech prod­uct that has at least 100,000 monthly ac­tive users or at least US$100 mil­lion in rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Re­cruit­ment agency Rand­stad Sin­ga­pore’s se­nior di­rec­tor for in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy Daljit Sall said the bar has been set high to en­sure Tech.Pass at­tracts only “se­ri­ous movers and shak­ers” in the global tech in­dus­try. “This group of in­di­vid­u­als should have a proven track record and the ex­per­tise to not just fill the tal­ent gap, but also drive the in­dus­try for­ward,” he added.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) Busi­ness School said tech ti­tans in the field of com­puter graph­ics cards – the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Ad­vanced Mi­cro De­vices (AMD) Lisa Su and Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang – would be the type of tal­ent who would se­cure a Tech.Pass.</p>
    <p>DE­VEL­OP­ING TAL­ENT</p>
    <p>Be­yond fill­ing up key roles in or­gan­i­sa­tions, the EDB said Tech.Pass hold­ers can also groom lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als by tak­ing up lec­tur­ing roles in in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, serve as a men­tor or ad­viser to com­pa­nies here, and con­duct cor­po­rate train­ing.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Sin­ga­pore Tech Fo­rum on Nov 17, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said that while the coun­try has a sup­port­ive en­vi­ron­ment for tech­nol­ogy in terms of in­fra­struc­ture, the key fac­tor is tal­ent, and Sin­ga­pore needs more of it.</p>
    <p>Mr Chng Kai Fong, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the EDB, said pass hold­ers who pur­sue en­trepreneur­ship will also gen­er­ate busi­ness spend­ing lo­cally and cre­ate jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cals to learn.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to con­cerns that Tech.Pass may at­tract tal­ent from only a few sources, some ex­pect safe­guards to be in place.</p>
    <p>Dr Protassov said: “I’d ex­pect the first 500 of el­i­gi­ble can­di­dates to come from di­verse back­grounds, coun­tries and fields.</p>
    <p>“There will also likely be quo­tas in place to en­sure the even dis­tri­bu­tion of the ar­riv­ing for­eign pro­fes­sion­als, as is stan­dard prac­tice.”</p>
    <p>Prof Loh said those who ap­ply for Tech.Pass should be able to value-add to the or­gan­i­sa­tions they work for in mul­ti­ple ways.</p>
    <p>“These lead­ers should be able to take on a com­pre­hen­sive suite of ini­tia­tives be­yond in­no­va­tion and in­vest­ment – ca­pa­bil­ity de­vel­op­ment of the lo­cal pipe­line should be a key pri­or­ity,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>EN­SUR­ING DIVER­SITY</p>
    <p>I’d ex­pect the first 500 of el­i­gi­ble can­di­dates to come from di­verse back­grounds, coun­tries and fields. There will also likely be quo­tas in place to en­sure the even dis­tri­bu­tion of the ar­riv­ing for­eign pro­fes­sion­als, as is stan­dard prac­tice.</p>
