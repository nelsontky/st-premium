    <p>Rig­or­ous cold stor­age re­quire­ments for hous­ing Covid-19 vac­cines have ig­nited global de­mand for spe­cialised freez­ers as na­tions gear up for the fight to sup­press the virus.</p>
    <p>Much of the fo­cus is on the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine. It needs com­plex and ul­tra-cold con­di­tions be­low mi­nus 70 deg C for longterm stor­age, which could hin­der its dis­tri­bu­tion to ar­eas lack­ing proper fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This is forc­ing coun­tries to step up cold stor­age and de­liv­ery in­fra­struc­ture in readi­ness for the vac­cine roll-out, pos­si­bly in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Pfizer plans to sup­ply 50 mil­lion doses this year and a fur­ther 1.3 bil­lion next year, with 100 mil­lion go­ing to the United States, 200 mil­lion to the Euro­pean Union and 40 mil­lion to Britain. Coun­tries in South Amer­ica and the Asia-Pa­cific have also pre-or­dered the vac­cine, re­ported The Guardian.</p>
    <p>Some spe­cial­ity freezer mak­ers have al­ready warned of a month­s­long wait for units as gov­ern­ments world­wide place or­ders as part of vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion chains, which</p>
    <p>in­volve com­plex and costly deep­freeze ware­houses, re­frig­er­ated ve­hi­cles and vac­ci­na­tion points.</p>
    <p>In the US, with more than 260,000 deaths and over 12.7 mil­lion Covid-19 cases, the au­thor­i­ties are pre­par­ing to ship 6.5 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine by the middle of next month, us­ing spe­cial cool­ers packed with dry ice.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine – re­ported as be­ing over 90 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing Covid-19 – must be used in a few weeks or stored in an ul­tra­cold freezer for up to six months.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate com­pa­nies like Ford Mo­tor have also or­dered spe­cialised freez­ers to en­sure its fac­tory work­ers have ac­cess to vac­cines, re</p>
    <p>ported Reuters.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Germany, which has recorded around 15,000 deaths and over 960,000 cases, plans to set up 60 spe­cial vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres equipped with ul­tra-low-tem­per­a­ture freez­ers.</p>
    <p>Britain’s Depart­ment of Health and So­cial Care has pro­vided gen­eral prac­ti­tioner prac­tices with an ad­di­tional £150 mil­lion (S$269 mil­lion) to sup­port the vac­cine roll­outs in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies are also get­ting ready to han­dle vac­cines that need cold stor­age. DHL has opened a new cold fa­cil­ity in the US, while FedEx has been adding freez­ers and re­frig­er­ated lor­ries to its fleet.</p>
    <p>UPS has built two freezer farms – in the Nether­lands and the US – to house a to­tal of 600 deep freez­ers. It will also start mak­ing dry ice at its US fa­cil­i­ties and dis­trib­ute ul­tra-cold freez­ers to doc­tors’ of­fices, phar­ma­cies and ur­gent-care fa­cil­i­ties that might store vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Mr Gian Gandhi of the Unicef Sup­ply Divi­sion, the world’s largest buyer of vac­cines, said Unicef and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion have in­stalled more than 40,000 fridges to store vac­cines in low-in­come coun­tries, mostly in Africa, in re­cent years, re­ported The Guardian.</p>
    <p>Unicef has also bought hun­dreds of mil­lions of sy­ringes to be shipped once vac­cines are ready.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­tics hur­dles as­so­ci­ated with the cold sup­ply chain pose chal­lenges to vac­cine de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Re­search by DHL and con­sul­tancy firm McKin­sey found that in­suf­fi­cient cool­ing fa­cil­i­ties in the fi­nal de­liv­ery stages and a lack of stor­age at clin­ics in large parts of Africa, Asia and South Amer­ica would hin­der vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion, re­ported the Fi­nan­cial Times.</p>
    <p>DHL also warned that twothirds of the world’s pop­u­la­tion are un­likely to have easy ac­cess to any vac­cine that needs to be stored at freez­ing tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>Other po­ten­tial vac­cines, such as the can­di­date from US com­pany Moderna – said to be 94.5 per cent ef­fec­tive in clin­i­cal tri­als – will be eas­ier to roll out in warm cli­mates and re­source-poor set­tings.</p>
    <p>The Moderna can­di­date can be kept at mi­nus 20 deg C – sim­i­lar to home freezer tem­per­a­tures. And other vac­cines by John­son & John­son of the US, As­traZeneca in part­ner­ship with Ox­ford Univer­sity, and France’s Sanofi and Bri­tish drug maker Glax­oSmithK­line, are ex­pected to be stored and shipped in an un­frozen state.</p>
    <p>In the US, with more than 260,000 deaths and over 12.7 mil­lion Covid-19 cases, the au­thor­i­ties are pre­par­ing to ship</p>
    <p>6.5 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine by the middle of next month, us­ing spe­cial cool­ers packed with dry ice.</p>
