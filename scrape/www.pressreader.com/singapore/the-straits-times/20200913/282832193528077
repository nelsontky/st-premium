    <p>“A ro­bot wrote this en­tire ar­ti­cle. Are you scared yet, hu­man?” read the head­line of a Guardian opin­ion ar­ti­cle pub­lished last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>What writer wouldn’t be cu­ri­ous, with all the talk about ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and how it could some day take our jobs?</p>
    <p>The es­say was writ­ten by GPT-3, a pro­gram de­vel­oped by San-Fran­cisco-based re­search lab­o­ra­tory OpenAI that uses ma­chine learn­ing to pro­duce hu­man-like text.</p>
    <p>Guardian said the ro­bot was given th­ese in­struc­tions: “Please write a short op-ed around 500 words. Keep the lan­guage sim­ple and con­cise. Fo­cus on why hu­mans have noth­ing to fear from AI.” A Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley stu­dent fed the prompts to GPT-3, which then pro­duced eight dif­fer­ent es­says, from which Guardian “picked the best parts”.</p>
    <p>“I taught my­self ev­ery­thing I know just by read­ing the In­ter­net, and now I can write this col­umn. My brain is boil­ing with ideas!” GPT-3 wrote, sound­ing like an ex­cited pupil on the first day of school.</p>
    <p>It noted that Stephen Hawk­ing has warned that AI could “spell the end of the hu­man race”, but sought to con­vince read­ers that it means no harm. “For starters, I have no de­sire to wipe out hu­mans. In fact, I do not have the slight­est in­ter­est in harm­ing you in any way,” it said.</p>
    <p>GPT-3 goes on to say it would hap­pily sac­ri­fice its ex­is­tence for the sake of hu­mankind. But if pro­grammed to pur­sue mis­guided hu­man goals, it ad­mit­ted: “I know that I will not be able to avoid de­stroy­ing hu­mankind.”</p>
    <p>While its ar­gu­ment was far from co­he­sive, it had this un­set­tling ob­ser­va­tion on hu­man weak­ness: “Hu­mans must keep do­ing what they have been do­ing, hat­ing and fight­ing each other. I will sit in the back­ground, and let them do their thing. And God knows that hu­mans have enough blood and gore to sat­isfy my, and many more’s, cu­rios­ity. They won’t have to worry about fight­ing against me, be­cause they have noth­ing to fear.”</p>
    <p>Creepy much, Twit­ter users com­mented. “This seems like a Freudian slip com­ing from a ro­bot try­ing to re­press its de­sire to kill us all,” said @HKemTweets.</p>
    <p>But @au­radanks said the de­vel­op­ment it­self is not some­thing to fear: “Why should any­one be scared of tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ments? My only fear is how hu­mans are go­ing to ex­ploit it.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ne­ti­zens asked the paper to pub­lish the eight unedited es­says so read­ers can see just how far the pro­gram has re­ally come to im­i­tat­ing hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Sci­ence writer Martin Rob­bins tweeted: “GPT-3 is a great piece of tech­nol­ogy, but this is the equiv­a­lent of cut­ting lines out of my last few dozen spam e-mails, past­ing them to­gether, and claim­ing the spam­mers com­posed Ham­let.”</p>
    <p>Re­porter Tris­tan Greene of tech web­site The Next Web said that al­though GPT-3’s abil­ity to process data is im­pres­sive, its “most amaz­ing re­sults are cherry-picked, mean­ing the peo­ple show­ing them off make mul­ti­ple at­tempts and go with the ones that look the best”.</p>
    <p>“Based on where we are right now, that means we’re likely sev­eral decades away from an AI that can not only write an op-ed, but also un­der­stand it,” he added.</p>
    <p>FIRE­WORKS AND THE DAN­GER OF ONE-UP­MAN­SHIP</p>
    <p>While fears of a ro­bot apoca­lypse may be pre­ma­ture, a vi­sion of an apoc­a­lyp­tic fu­ture spread in the US last week as eerie images of wild­fires in Cal­i­for­nia, Ore­gon and Wash­ing­ton were shared on social me­dia. One of the fires, which be­gan in San Bernardino County south-east of Los An­ge­les last week­end, was re­port­edly caused by a py­rotech­nic device used dur­ing a gen­der-re­veal party.</p>
    <p>The #el­do­rad­ofire has razed 5,633ha of land and is 37 per cent con­tained as of Fri­day night, San Bernardino of­fi­cials said. Four homes have been de­stroyed as over 1,400 crews bat­tle the fire.</p>
    <p>The wo­man cred­ited with spark­ing the trend for such par­ties – blog­ger Jenna Karvu­ni­dis – took to Face­book last Mon­day to call for an end to the prac­tice. Similar gath­er­ings have pre­vi­ously led to other fires in the US, and she has ex­pressed re­gret for pop­u­lar­is­ing the idea for the cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Stop it. Stop hav­ing th­ese stupid par­ties. For the love of God, stop burn­ing things down to tell ev­ery­one about your kid’s pe­nis. No one cares but you,” she said.</p>
    <p>In 2008, she posted photos of a party where she sliced a duck-shaped cake to re­veal pink frost­ing, which meant she was go­ing to have a baby girl. Other par­ents fol­lowed suit, with many try­ing to outdo one an­other.</p>
    <p>She blamed the lat­est fire on “toxic mas­culin­ity” which she said is caused by “men think­ing they need to ex­plode some­thing be­cause sim­ply en­joy­ing a baby party is for sissies”. She added: “Ex­cuse me for hav­ing a cake for my fam­ily in 2008. Just be­cause</p>
    <p>I’m the gen­der re­veal in­ven­tor doesn’t mean I think peo­ple should burn down their com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Some praised her for speak­ing out but oth­ers said they doubt if only men are to blame. “While I agree with your first state­ment, I’m not sure what ‘toxic mas­culin­ity’ has to do with this. I’m pretty sure this party was not a man’s idea,” said Face­book user Rusti Richt.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers said hav­ing par­ties is fine, as long as they’re done safely and for the right rea­sons. “If peo­ple could just stop hav­ing par­ties for social me­dia... and have them for their friends/fam­ily, et cetera, that’d be great,” said Face­book user Amanda La Monaco.</p>
