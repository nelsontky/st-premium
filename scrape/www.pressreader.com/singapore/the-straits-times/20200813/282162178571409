    <p>Cof­fee shop owner Tan Beng Gim, 52, was sen­tenced to eight months’ jail yes­ter­day, af­ter plead­ing guilty to a charge of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt in an al­ter­ca­tion that re­sulted in a 51-year-old man’s death.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial mur­der charge against Tan had been re­duced to a count of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt.</p>
    <p>At about 2.30pm on April 11, 2018, Tan and the vic­tim, cof­fee shop pa­tron Ng Boon Chye, were in­volved in a fight with each other next to a refuse dis­posal area at Block 966 Jurong West Street 93. This was around 50m from the cof­fee shop that Tan owned – NTI food court at Block 964 Jurong West 93.</p>
    <p>Videos screened in court showed Mr Ng walk­ing past the ta­ble where Tan was eat­ing at NTI food court. The court heard that the two men knew each other and had quar­relled at the cof­fee shop on March 6 that year.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Gabriel Choong said that Mr Ng had ex­changed looks with Tan, but kept a wide berth as he walked away and dou­bled back across the court­yard ad­ja­cent to the cof­fee shop.</p>
    <p>Tan then got up from where he was hav­ing lunch and ap­proached Mr Ng, af­ter which the two had a heated, ex­ple­tive-laden dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim then at­tempted to walk away sev­eral times but Tan shouted at him, shoved him and asked if he was “try­ing to test (Tan’s) pa­tience”.</p>
    <p>Un­able to come to a res­o­lu­tion, Tan then placed an arm around the vic­tim and steered him to­wards the refuse dis­posal area be­hind the cof­fee shop, telling him that they would “go be­hind to set­tle the prob­lem”.</p>
    <p>At the refuse dis­posal area, Tan and Mr Ng were then filmed goad­ing each other and spout­ing Hokkien vul­gar­i­ties in a heated ar­gu­ment, af­ter which blows were ex­changed.</p>
    <p>DPP Choong pointed out a mo­ment in the video when Tan swung and slammed the de­ceased into the floor. Mr Ng hit the ground with a loud thud and stayed face down and im­mo­bile.</p>
    <p>DPP Choong said that the vic­tim was “no saint”, as he started the fight by throw­ing the first punch and kick­ing the ac­cused in what had ini­tially been a ver­bal dis­agree­ment. “Yet this was not a onesided af­fair. While the ac­cused had backed off, he was not truly in­tent on dis­en­gag­ing. He could have walked away from the in­ci­dent lo­ca­tion at any time he de­sired; the same could not be said of the vic­tim who had been herded there against his will,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng was brought to the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal, where he was treated for mul­ti­ple head in­juries, in­clud­ing a skull frac­ture and dam­age to his right frontal lobe. He was then cer­ti­fied brain dead and suc­cumbed to his in­juries on April 15.</p>
    <p>An as­sault charge of charg­ing at and knock­ing down an un­known man at NTI food court at around 10.45pm on April 4, 2018, was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion in Tan’s sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Tan has filed an ap­peal against his eight-month jail sen­tence.</p>
