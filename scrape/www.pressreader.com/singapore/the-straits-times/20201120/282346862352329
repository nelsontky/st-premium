    <p>World No. 1 No­vak Djokovic ad­mit­ted that he needs to play cleaner tennis if he is to stay on course for a record­e­qualling sixth ATP Fi­nals ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The Serb lost for just the fourth time this year when fourth seed Daniil Medvedev beat him 6-3, 6-3 on Wed­nes­day to leave his hopes of es­cap­ing from the Tokyo 1970 group in peril.</p>
    <p>Djokovic com­mit­ted 24 un­forced er­rors and five dou­ble faults and faces a straight shootout with world No. 7 Alexan­der Zverev to­day for a place in the semi-fi­nals along­side Medvedev in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“I can­not al­low these things to hap­pen when I’m play­ing the top play­ers in the world,” Djokovic said of los­ing seven games in a row af­ter es­tab­lish­ing a 3-2 lead over Medvedev.</p>
    <p>“He was just bet­ter, no ques­tion about it. We started well. Up to 3-3 (in the first set) it was quite an even match but af­ter that break he was cruis­ing. I strug­gled to find the right level.”</p>
    <p>By the time Djokovic man­aged to stop the rot, the 33-year-old was a set and 3-1 in ar­rears.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Medvedev was re­lent­less, how­ever, and con­tin­ued to boss the base­line ral­lies.</p>
    <p>Only Rafael Nadal, in the French Open fi­nal, and Lorenzo Sonego, in the quar­ter-fi­nals in Vi­enna, have got the bet­ter of Djokovic, who was de­faulted at the US Open, this year.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier at the empty O2 Arena, Zverev bounced back from his de­feat by Medvedev to beat Ar­gentina’s Diego Schwartz­man 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­cited for Fri­day,” said Zverev.</p>
    <p>“Fri­day’s going to be the most dif­fi­cult match-up that you can have here, against No­vak.”</p>
    <p>The Ger­man, who has won two ti­tles in the coro­n­avirus-trun­cated season, beat Djokovic in the fi­nal in Lon­don two years ago but is 3-2 be­hind in their head-to-head meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Djokovic, who de­feated Schwartz­man 6-3, 6-2 in his open­ing match here, beat Zverev the last time they met at last year’s French Open.</p>
    <p>In yesterday’s match, Aus­trian Dominic Thiem, who had al­ready sealed a semi-fi­nal berth from the Lon­don 2020 group, lost 6-2, 7-5 to An­drey Rublev in 66 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The eighth-ranked Rus­sian sal­vaged some pride in the year-end fi­nale af­ter suf­fer­ing group de­feats by Nadal and Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas.</p>
    <p>World No. 3 Thiem will be gun­ning for his sec­ond ti­tle of the year af­ter his US Open tri­umph in Septem­ber.</p>
