    <p>When a woman was ap­pre­hended ear­lier this month at shop­ping mall Novena Square, a video of her be­ing de­tained was cir­cu­lated with some claim­ing that the po­lice had abused their power and ar­rested her for no rea­son.</p>
    <p>This use of mis­in­for­ma­tion was an at­tempt to dele­git­imise the po­lice, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shanmugam said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Min­is­ter’s Awards Pre­sen­ta­tion Cer­e­mony that was held on­line, he noted that there have been in­creas­ing at­tempts to dele­git­imise en­force­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>But the po­lice and other agen­cies will not be in­tim­i­dated by such moves, he added.</p>
    <p>“When the po­lice take ac­tion, there are some who will claim that in­ves­ti­ga­tions are po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated, make other base­less claims about law en­force­ment pro­cesses,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple want spe­cial ex­emp­tions from in­ves­ti­ga­tions, es­pe­cially when the al­le­ga­tions against them are se­ri­ous, such as those in­volv­ing crim­i­nal breach of trust or sex­ual ha­rass­ment, he added.</p>
    <p>“But the rule of law ap­plies to all, re­gard­less of who you are.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said the woman de­tained at Novena Square had spat at a man and bit his hand, af­ter al­legedly pour­ing soup over his head.</p>
    <p>The woman also hurled ver­bal abuse and spat at po­lice of­fi­cers when they en­gaged her, and her rel­a­tives could not calm her down.</p>
    <p>“She was as­sessed to be pos­ing a dan­ger, to both the pub­lic and to her­self,” Mr Shanmugam said.</p>
    <p>Separately, he said a photo show­ing po­lice of­fi­cers en­gag­ing two madrasah stu­dents was mis­rep­re­sented in July last year.</p>
    <p>“The photo was cir­cu­lated to spread a false­hood that the of­fi­cers were con­duct­ing spot checks on the two madrasah stu­dents, be­cause the of­fi­cers had a quota to ful­fil.”</p>
    <p>But the of­fi­cers, he said, were ac­tu­ally en­gag­ing the stu­dents to en­cour­age them to par­tic­i­pate in Rid­ers-On-Watch, a com­mu­nity polic­ing ini­tia­tive en­acted last year to keep crime out of trans­port nodes.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Shanmugam also high­lighted two other key chal­lenges faced by the Home Team: the threat of ter­ror­ism, which has not gone away, and the Covid-19 fight.</p>
    <p>He said the Home Team, with other agen­cies, has helped to bring down lo­cal com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion to a low level.</p>
    <p>But he warned that the risk of an­other wave of in­fec­tion is ever present.</p>
    <p>“We have to adapt to this new en­vi­ron­ment, to en­sure that the Home Team de­liv­ers on our core mis­sion of keep­ing Sin­ga­pore safe and se­cure,” he added.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, 189 awards were given out to out­stand­ing of­fi­cers, teams and agen­cies that have demon­strated ef­fi­ciency and com­pe­tency in ma­jor oper­a­tions, cases and projects, or dis­played high standards of in­no­va­tion and ser­vice excellence at work.</p>
    <p>The re­cip­i­ents in­clude a team of po­lice of­fi­cers in­volved in an oper­a­tion that saw 21 peo­ple ar­rested for tak­ing part in more than 440 scam cases to do with the sale of face masks.</p>
