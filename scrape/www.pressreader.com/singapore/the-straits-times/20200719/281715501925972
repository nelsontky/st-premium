    <p>The main fo­cus for the Gov­ern­ment now is get­ting Sin­ga­pore through the Covid-19 cri­sis, and the ques­tion of po­lit­i­cal suc­ces­sion will be dealt with at a later point, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters at the PAP’s Be­dok head­quar­ters dur­ing a press con­fer­ence that was livestream­ed to party ac­tivists, Mr Wong also said there was “noth­ing to be read” from who chairs such press con­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>“We are at the stage where we are still in a cri­sis, we are re­ally look­ing at get­ting Sin­ga­pore out of this huge cri­sis – health­care, eco­nomic is­sues – (and) so our fo­cus right now is to have the team all work­ing as one fo­cus­ing on this, over­com­ing the cri­sis and emerg­ing stronger from the cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mat­ter whether it’s 4G, 3G, what­ever G, right? I think who­ever is in Gov­ern­ment, all of us are fo­cused on this par­tic­u­lar is­sue.</p>
    <p>“There will be time later on to talk about suc­ces­sion but now, let’s fo­cus our minds on over­com­ing the cri­sis and get­ting through it. That’s our main fo­cus.”</p>
    <p>Asked about the tim­ing of the press con­fer­ence and why he was helm­ing it in­stead of Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat or Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing, Mr Wong said the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) con­ducts a post-mortem af­ter ev­ery elec­tion, and the party felt it would be use­ful to set the con­text of its pre­lim­i­nary find­ings of the elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng and Mr Chan are, re­spec­tively, the PAP’s first and sec­ond as­sis­tant sec­re­taries-gen­eral. Mr Wong is a mem­ber of the party’s cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, and ad­viser to the PAP Pol­icy Fo­rum, which or­gan­ises reg­u­lar di­a­logues for rank-and-file party mem­bers to en­gage gov­ern­ment lead­ers on poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“We are do­ing a thor­ough re­view as we do af­ter ev­ery gen­eral elec­tion, but this time round we de­cided not to wait un­til the end of the re­view, which might take a month or more, but to just come out ear­lier to set this in con­text and to give our per­spec­tives,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>“I’m do­ing it to­day but it could have been any one of us. I don’t think you need to read too much into who is the spokesper­son.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong was also asked whether the re­view would look at whether DPM Heng re­mains the best per­son to lead the PAP’s 4G team, fol­low­ing GE2020.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng’s last-minute switch on Nom­i­na­tion Day from Tampines GRC, where he had been MP for two terms, to helm the PAP’s East Coast team is seen by some as a move that pre­vented the loss of East Coast GRC to the Work­ers’ Party, but ob­servers noted that Mr Heng’s team won the five-mem­ber GRC with a slim­mer than ex­pected vote share of 53.39 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the re­view would</p>
    <p>be fo­cused on the elec­tion, rather than on suc­ces­sion mat­ters.</p>
    <p>“At an ap­pro­pri­ate time once the re­view is com­pleted, we might do a sim­i­lar press con­fer­ence like this,” he said. “It may be a dif­fer­ent per­son... again, it may be me, may be some­one else – noth­ing to be read from the per­son helm­ing it.”</p>
    <p>“Or it may be done later on at the party con­ven­tion. We find dif­fer­ent oc­ca­sions where we may share some of these, if there are ad­di­tional things that we wish to share, both with our ac­tivists and also with the pub­lic,” he added.</p>
