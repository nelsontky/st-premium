    <p>I paid about $2,000 to a well-known com­pany to have my home painted a cou­ple of years ago.</p>
    <p>I ex­pected a team of work­ers to be de­ployed, but, to my sur­prise, a lone painter, who was from Myan­mar, came and he got the job done nicely in two days.</p>
    <p>He was prob­a­bly paid a monthly salary of $800 to $1,000, and so the com­pany stood to earn close to $20,000 a month if it had se­cured 10 jobs for this sole worker.</p>
    <p>This raises the ques­tion – shouldn’t Sin­ga­pore work­ers con­sider such jobs as a pos­si­ble ca­reer by be­ing crafts­men?</p>
    <p>I am not sug­gest­ing they should work for the com­pany for $1,000 or more a month. Rather, they should pick up such skills and, to take this ex­am­ple, of­fer their ser­vices as pro­fes­sional painters.</p>
    <p>Even if a Sin­ga­pore painter starts as a one­man show, he can earn about $4,000 a month by just work­ing four days a week. If he is good and se­cures more jobs when word gets around, earn­ing $16,000 or more a month is cer­tainly not be­yond reach.</p>
    <p>In­deed, if he gets cre­ative and can help his cus­tomers cre­ate un­usual mo­tifs and pat­terns on their walls, his fees can cer­tainly be dou­bled or tripled. He can also hold classes to teach painter wannabes who want to dec­o­rate their own homes.</p>
    <p>This is just what one skilled Sin­ga­pore crafts­man can of­fer – imag­ine the earn­ing po­ten­tial if he teams up with other skilled Sin­ga­pore crafts­men such as elec­tri­cians, air-con spe­cial­ists, plumbers and car­pen­ters.</p>
    <p>These are some of the es­sen­tial ser­vices all house­holds need, but the re­al­ity is that the work­ers who come to our homes to do such work now are usu­ally not Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Per­haps many young peo­ple to­day are too fo­cused on for­eign work­ers’ low monthly salaries while be­ing blind to the fact that such trades can launch a prof­itable busi­ness.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, such skills are cer­tainly more valu­able and mar­ketable than that of a food de­liv­ery per­son.</p>
    <p>A mind­set change is needed, with Pro­fes­sor Joseph Che­rian, the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School’s prac­tice pro­fes­sor of fi­nance, not­ing that many peo­ple in this part of the world seem to have a poor view of blue-col­lar jobs.</p>
    <p>“Many of my Amer­i­can univer­sity mates re­galed me with sto­ries of them bag­ging groceries, wait­ing on ta­bles, dish-wash­ing, de­liv­er­ing news­pa­pers, walk­ing dogs and sit­ting ba­bies to earn an ex­tra buck while in high school. There was no shame in do­ing such me­nial tasks for pay,” he says.</p>
    <p>“If our kids also take on such part-time jobs, it would not only pro­vide them with side in­come, it would also help them gain use­ful life ex­pe­ri­ences and em­pa­thy. It may even help al­le­vi­ate the labour short­age prob­lem in our ser­vice in­dus­try,” he adds.</p>
    <p>There is no rea­son why the scope of jobs must stay the same when the pay goes up.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a garbage worker in New York starts at around US$2,700 (S$3,670) a month, but that can go up to as high as US$6,600 for a se­nior garbage col­lec­tor.</p>
    <p>But they don’t just empty trash cans, they also en­force re­cy­cling habits, of­fer spe­cialised dis­posal ser­vices and can refuse to col­lect rub­bish from peo­ple who fail to fol­low the rules.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, it all de­pends on how you de­fine the job – you can view it as mun­dane, with no prospects, or you can see how you can do the same job dif­fer­ently, with cre­ativ­ity and pas­sion.</p>
    <p>In­deed, all Sin­ga­pore work­ers can make them­selves in­dis­pens­able to their bosses overnight if they can just do one thing – pro­vide great cus­tomer ser­vice.</p>
    <p>It seems that de­spite all the talk about job cuts from strug­gling busi­nesses now, the stan­dard of ser­vice from many Sin­ga­pore work­ers has not re­ally im­proved.</p>
    <p>These three ex­am­ples, which hap­pened re­cently, are prob­a­bly com­monly en­coun­tered by many peo­ple.</p>
    <p>1. You call a restau­rant a few days ear­lier to book a ta­ble for lunch for your fam­ily. When you ar­rive, you are shown to a ta­ble next to the toi­let. To rub salt into the wound, you no­tice that walk-in din­ers are of­fered bet­ter ta­bles. The wait­ers change your ta­ble only af­ter you make a com­plaint.</p>
    <p>A shop­per at a depart­ment store in Or­chard Road asks about a spe­cial item that is on of­fer while mak­ing pay­ment. As the item has sold out at that cashier’s counter, the shop­per is asked to go to the up­per floors to ask other coun­ters in­stead. Yet, the store is prac­ti­cally empty and there are sev­eral sales em­ploy­ees chat­ting among them­selves close by.</p>
    <p>Din­ers at a pop­u­lar salad restau­rant have to catch the at­ten­tion of servers who are busy chat­ting. As ta­bles are also un­cleared, the din­ers re­quest the servers’ help, which is given in a grouchy man­ner.</p>
    <p>Of course, for ev­ery em­ployee with poor at­ti­tude, there is prob­a­bly an­other who truly be­lieves in pro­vid­ing great ser­vice with a smile.</p>
    <p>Know that the abil­ity to show cus­tomers that you gen­uinely care about their ex­pe­ri­ence is an ever­green skill that is not only fu­ture­proof, it is also one thing that makes hu­mans bet­ter than robots.</p>
    <p>This is the rea­son why restau­rants in China are still re­luc­tant to re­place good wait­ers with robots be­cause they know that pas­sion­ate hu­man touches can please their cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>So, rather than worry about the next job cut, make your em­ploy­ers know that they stand to lose even more cus­tomers if they let you go.</p>
