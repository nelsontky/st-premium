    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan-based ticket hold­ers for the post­poned Tokyo Olympics will be able to ap­ply for re­funds from Nov 10, Games or­gan­is­ers said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With the Games de­layed un­til next July be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, or­gan­is­ers added that ticket hold­ers can get a re­fund if they no longer wished to at­tend.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers said they would ac­cept re­fund re­quests for tick­ets from those re­sid­ing in Ja­pan from Nov 10-30 and for Par­a­lympics ticket hold­ers from Dec 1-21.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers have sold over five mil­lion tick­ets for the Olympics and Par­a­lympics do­mes­ti­cally, but have yet to de­cide whether spec­ta­tors will be al­lowed into venues, with a de­ci­sion ex­pected by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>“If we are not able to pro­vide an op­por­tu­nity to spec­tate the Games due to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, then we will of­fer an ad­di­tional op­por­tu­nity to ap­ply for a re­fund,” Tokyo 2020 mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor Hi­de­nori Suzuki said.</p>
    <p>Those liv­ing out­side Ja­pan had to pur­chase their tick­ets from au­tho­rised ticket re­sellers (ATRs) and each ATR would be in­di­vid­u­ally re­spon­si­ble for their own re­fund pro­ce­dures, ac­cord­ing to or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>The lat­est ver­sion of the Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee bud­get, re­leased in De­cem­ber 2019, saw US$800 mil­lion (S$1.09 bil­lion) com­ing in from ticket sales.</p>
    <p>On the im­pact po­ten­tial re­funds would have, or­gan­is­ers said no de­tails will be re­leased un­til the bud­get is an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee has al­ready said that the de­lay will cost it ap­prox­i­mately US$800 mil­lion, while Ja­panese or­gan­is­ers have yet to an­nounce what their share will be.</p>
    <p>Separately, the march­ing or­der of pa­rade at the Tokyo 2020 open­ing cer­e­mony will be de­cided by the Ja­panese names of na­tions and Ja­pan’s “fifty sound” pho­netic or­der, Ky­odo news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion was made in the hope of pro­mot­ing Ja­panese cul­ture when the Games start.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes from par­tic­i­pat­ing na­tions in the coun­try’s past three Olympics – the 1964 Sum­mer Games in Tokyo, the 1972 Win­ter Games in Sap­poro and the 1998 Win­ter Games in Nagano – all marched ac­cord­ing to English al­pha­bet­i­cal or­der.</p>
