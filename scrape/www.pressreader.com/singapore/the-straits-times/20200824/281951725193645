    <p>TAIPEI/ LON­DON/ SHEN­ZHEN • For Mr Guo Ping, chair­man of Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy group Huawei, last Mon­day was a day like any other. In a speech in the south­ern Chi­nese city of Shen­zhen, he painted a rosy pic­ture of how Huawei’s tech­no­log­i­cal prow­ess and lead­er­ship in 5G tele­coms equip­ment would trans­form the com­pany’s home town into a global dig­i­tal show­case city.</p>
    <p>Hours later, that prom­ise was shat­tered – shot down by an an­nounce­ment from the United States govern­ment that it will use the global dom­i­nance of Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy to cut off all sup­plies of semi­con­duc­tors to Huawei.</p>
    <p>In board­rooms and govern­ment of­fices around the world, the new rules sparked fran­tic dis­cus­sions about whether the move would de­liver a fa­tal blow to the US$122 bil­lion (S$167 bil­lion) firm, how quickly Huawei might fold, and what the col­lapse of the world’s largest tele­coms equip­ment provider would mean for net­works in the 170 coun­tries that run on its hard­ware.</p>
    <p>While some an­a­lysts spoke of it be­ing a “death sen­tence”, oth­ers won­dered what lengths Bei­jing would be will­ing to go to pro­tect a com­pany at the heart of re­cent US-China ten­sions.</p>
    <p>One Euro­pean tele­coms ex­ec­u­tive calls the prospect of the lead­ing sup­plier in the mar­ket col­laps­ing “cat­a­strophic”. Net­works are al­ready hav­ing to shoul­der the cost of re­duc­ing the amount of Huawei equip­ment un­der grow­ing po­lit­i­cal pres­sure in Western coun­tries from Aus­tralia to Bri­tain. The bur­den of a Huawei col­lapse is most likely to be felt by in­cum­bent tele­coms com­pa­nies such as BT, Deutsche Telekom and</p>
    <p>Swiss­com, ar­gues one ex­ec­u­tive, given their use of the Chi­nese com­pany’s kit in broad­band net­works.</p>
    <p>THE LONG BAT­TLE</p>
    <p>But for Wash­ing­ton, this is the cli­max of a 15-year bat­tle against Huawei that be­gan when the firm tried to en­ter the US mar­ket for the first time in the early 2000s.</p>
    <p>Long-time ob­servers say the US is get­ting close to a goal that has proved elu­sive. “How do you kill Huawei?” asks Mr Dun­can Clark, chair­man of China tech­nol­ogy and tele­com ad­vi­sory com­pany BDA, of the US dilemma.</p>
    <p>“Like with a worm, you cut off the head and it keeps go­ing.”</p>
    <p>Driven by the be­lief that Huawei could en­able the rul­ing Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party and its mil­i­tary to spy on other coun­tries and their com­pa­nies, un­der­mine their na­tional se­cu­rity and steal their com­mer­cial se­crets, the US govern­ment used every op­tion open to it.</p>
    <p>It stopped Huawei ac­qui­si­tions of Amer­i­can com­pa­nies and as­sets through its na­tional se­cu­rity re­view for for­eign in­vest­ments. It leaned on lead­ing US tele­coms op­er­a­tors not to work with the com­pany and it con­ducted a Congress-led probe into the firm. It pur­sued a crim­i­nal pros­e­cu­tion which put Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer and daugh­ter of its founder, un­der house ar­rest in Canada, await­ing the out­come of an ex­tra­di­tion hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Last year, the ad­min­is­tra­tion started tar­get­ing Huawei with sanc­tions, two ear­lier rounds of which proved por­ous. This time, in­dus­try ex­perts say it is hard to see how Huawei can wrig­gle out of Wash­ing­ton’s noose.</p>
    <p>“Hand­sets and base sta­tions re­quire semi­con­duc­tors. These two busi­ness lines make up 90 per cent of Huawei’s busi­ness; with­out be­ing able to man­u­fac­ture these prod­ucts, the com­pany would no longer look like Huawei,” says Mr Dan Wang, tech­nol­ogy an­a­lyst at Gavekal Drago­nomics, a re­search firm, in Bei­jing. Ear­lier last week, Mr Wang called the new US rules a “death sen­tence”.</p>
    <p>NOVEM­BER HOPE</p>
    <p>Death, how­ever, is not im­mi­nent. Huawei has been build­ing stock­piles of chips since Wash­ing­ton stepped up the pres­sure on the com­pany two years ago. While in­dus­try ex­perts say that re­ports about it hav­ing amassed two years of in­ven­tory are overblown, they be­lieve that Huawei has enough chips to keep it go­ing for an­other six months.</p>
    <p>That would take it past the US elec­tion in early Novem­ber, and the in­au­gu­ra­tion of the next US pres­i­dent. Some an­a­lysts say the pos­si­bil­ity that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, whose ad­min­is­tra­tion has ze­roed in on China as a threat to Amer­ica, might be voted out of of­fice of­fers a glim­mer of hope to Huawei due to Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den’s record of a less con­fronta­tional stance to­wards China. Even the lat­est rules al­low for is­suance of tem­po­rary li­cences un­der which chip sup­plies could re­sume.</p>
    <p>But those hopes are slim. “A lot of peo­ple in the Chi­nese govern­ment are look­ing at (Joe Bi­den’s lead in the) Florida polls right now. But long-term thinkers in China un­der­stand that the pol­icy space for Bi­den will be lim­ited as well,” says Mr Ho­suk Lee-Makiyama, di­rec­tor of the Brus­sels-based Euro­pean Cen­tre for In­ter­na­tional Po­lit­i­cal Econ­omy who had pre­vi­ously in­ves­ti­gated Huawei for the Euro­pean Union as a trade lawyer.</p>
    <p>He adds that any po­ten­tial hon­ey­moon pe­riod for Bei­jing with an in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion is un­likely to last be­cause China can­not re­verse the key poli­cies and laws that have hard­ened Western gov­ern­ments’ stance against Huawei and China more broadly.</p>
    <p>At its core is Bei­jing’s na­tional se­cu­rity law, which re­quires com­pa­nies and ci­ti­zens to as­sist the se­cu­rity ser­vices in what­ever they may de­mand and which has fed fears of spy­ing. An­other is­sue cer­tain to con­tinue to trou­ble re­la­tions is Bei­jing’s move to curb Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy, civil rights and rule of law.</p>
    <p>Un­der that sce­nario, Huawei’s fu­ture looks dark. Wash­ing­ton ear­lier this month stopped rolling over tem­po­rary li­cences for US com­pa­nies to sell chips to Huawei. Rules im­posed in May, and the ad­di­tions that fol­lowed last week, mean that no com­pany any­where in the world can sell chips to Huawei di­rectly or in­di­rectly if they were de­signed us­ing soft­ware tools made by US com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Ca­dence and Synop­sys, or man­u­fac­tured us­ing equip­ment from US sup­pli­ers such as Ap­plied Ma­te­ri­als or Lam Re­search.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing Com­pany, the world’s largest con­tract chip­maker on which most chip de­sign houses rely to pro­duce their semi­con­duc­tors, will stop ship­ping to Huawei on Sept 15, the dead­line im­posed in May. Last Mon­day’s ad­di­tional re­stric­tions also block sup­plies of any other chips, be they mem­ory chips from South Korea’s Hynix or semi­con­duc­tors from Dutch com­pany NXP.</p>
    <p>“None of these com­pa­nies is free from US con­tent, the door is slammed shut,” says a Euro­pean trade of­fi­cial in China.</p>
    <p>The prospect that Bri­tish chip de­sign com­pany Arm will be taken over by Nvidia of the US has added to Huawei’s predica­ment. A per­son at HiSil­i­con, Huawei’s chip de­sign af­fil­i­ate, says that if the deal hap­pens, all of the Chi­nese com­pany’s chip de­sign would be in trou­ble be­cause its de­signs are based on Arm-li­censed blue­prints.</p>
    <p>Some of the com­pany’s al­most 200,000 em­ploy­ees are putting on a brave face. “I feel that ev­ery­one is quite calm be­cause we still have a lot of projects on hand which are not fin­ished yet, and govern­men­tal projects are also com­ing,” says an em­ployee at Huawei Cloud, adding that the di­vi­sion re­mains vi­able.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts chal­lenge such claims. Mr Lee-Makiyama says the cloud busi­ness, which is much more prof­itable than Huawei’s de­vices arm, is in as much trou­ble as the rest of the group be­cause the server hard­ware that any cloud ser­vices run on needs semi­con­duc­tors, while much of the cloud soft­ware is Amer­i­can, in­clud­ing data­bases from Or­a­cle and vir­tu­al­i­sa­tion ser­vices from VMware.</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers be­lieve the Chi­nese govern­ment will step in. “Huawei is too big to fail,” says a semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try ex­ec­u­tive in Tai­wan. “Bei­jing will surely help them.”</p>
    <p>BUILD­ING AN IN­DUS­TRY</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is how. Mr Wang con­tends that money – Bei­jing’s time-tested ap­proach to the tech in­dus­try – will not do the trick.</p>
    <p>“The com­pany de­clared around US$53 bil­lion in cash and short-term in­vest­ments in its last an­nual re­port, so it has sub­stan­tial re­sources. What it lacks are chips. In the short term, it’s not pos­si­ble to cre­ate a semi­con­duc­tor sup­ply chain that does not touch US tech­nol­ogy,” he says.</p>
    <p>Some be­lieve Bei­jing will force Chi­nese chip­mak­ers – which also con­tinue to rely on US soft­ware and equip­ment – to sup­ply Huawei. “They can re­or­gan­ise the do­mes­tic chip in­dus­try in what­ever way they like,” says the Tai­wanese ex­ec­u­tive. “You could form an intermedia­te layer be­tween sup­pli­ers and Huawei, and it may be pos­si­ble to hide your tracks a lit­tle.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, such a high-risk scheme, in vi­o­la­tion of Amer­i­can sanc­tions, could un­der­mine Bei­jing’s ul­ti­mate aim to build its own semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Trade lawyers pre­dict that any Chi­nese chip­maker try­ing to ship to Huawei in vi­o­la­tion of US rules will quickly be tar­geted by US sanc­tions, ham­per­ing Bei­jing’s quest for tech­nol­ogy self-suf­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers across Europe are al­ready wean­ing them­selves off Huawei’s equip­ment – the re­sult of the po­lit­i­cal pres­sure ex­erted by the US. “There is a much big­ger risk to us­ing Huawei now due to the mi­crochip sanc­tions,” says one ex­ec­u­tive at a lead­ing Euro­pean tele­coms com­pany that has used a large amount of Huawei equip­ment in the past. “(Huawei’s strug­gles) will change the bal­ance of power. We need some­one like Sam­sung to step in fast (to sup­ply equip­ment),” he adds.</p>
    <p>Tele­coms com­pa­nies have started to re­or­gan­ise their plans, par­tic­u­larly for 5G up­grades. The Chi­nese com­pany, which has a mar­ket share of al­most 50 per cent of some 4G net­works, has largely lost its role as “pri­mary ven­dor”, with com­pa­nies in­clud­ing BT and Three turn­ing to Eric­s­son as an al­ter­na­tive sup­plier. But four op­er­a­tors con­tacted by the Fi­nan­cial Times have yet to draw up con­tin­gency plans for a sce­nario in which Huawei col­lapses, an in­di­ca­tion that some in the in­dus­try at least see it as re­silient even in the face of the lat­est US on­slaught.</p>
    <p>Many ex­ec­u­tives at tele­coms car­ri­ers ar­gue that net­works would not grind to a halt if Huawei were to col­lapse, but it would rob the in­dus­try of the abil­ity to eas­ily main­tain net­works and prob­a­bly cause sig­nif­i­cant dis­rup­tion to cus­tomers due to an in­abil­ity to up­grade soft­ware from the Chi­nese com­pany and re­place faulty equip­ment. “It would be su­per painful,” says one ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>For Huawei, the pain will al­most cer­tainly be greater. In­dus­try ex­perts say it is hard to en­vi­sion how the com­pany could con­tinue run­ning its busi­ness in its cur­rent form un­der Wash­ing­ton’s seem­ingly wa­ter­tight sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>“The im­age of Huawei is now so as­so­ci­ated with the fear of a ‘Red Peril’ that they need to make some trades,” says Mr Clark, adding that the Chi­nese govern­ment was cer­tain to have a role in any re­struc­tur­ing. That, iron­i­cally, might trans­form Huawei into some­thing the US has sus­pected it to be but the Shen­zhen com­pany al­ways em­phat­i­cally de­nied: a Chi­nese state com­pany.</p>
