    <p>Dur­ing the ear­lier part of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, there was much hum­ble-brag­ging on­line about max­imis­ing a “pro­duc­tive pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>While few may have mas­tered a new lan­guage un­der the cir­cuit breaker which started in April, some peo­ple have, in­ad­ver­tently or not, shed bad habits or ac­quired good ones then.</p>
    <p>These new rou­tines are here to stay, say some in­ter­viewed by The Sun­day Times. Lo­cal celebrity Xiang Yun wanted to lose the ex­tra ki­los that made her un­happy. She is now de­ter­mined to main­tain her stun­ning al­most 10kg weight loss.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers found that the stay-home pe­riod en­cour­aged the sprout­ing of new hob­bies, where old pas­times – which were now too ex­pen­sive, or in­volved too many other re­sources or peo­ple – were no longer pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Psy­chol­o­gists have some ideas about how to make a de­sir­able cir­cuit breaker habit stick in the long term.</p>
    <p>Dr Bran­don Koh, an in­dus­tri­alor­gan­i­sa­tional psy­chol­o­gist at Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences, ad­vises analysing what fac­tors led you to gain bet­ter habits dur­ing the shut-in pe­riod, and to find ways to sus­tain them.</p>
    <p>Con­sider your re­sponses to ques­tions such as: If you have lost the flex­i­bil­ity of time, for ex­am­ple, by re­turn­ing to the of­fice, how will you con­fig­ure your sched­ule to keep up your good habits?</p>
    <p>Good goal set­ting helps, he says. Aims like keep­ing to a fit­ness rou­tine should be spe­cific to keep you on task. They should be mod­er­ately dif­fi­cult to achieve, as goals that are too hard are aban­doned, while those that are too sim­ple may not mo­ti­vate you.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, if you have formed bad habits like sleep­ing late, do not de­spair. Dr Koh sug­gests “tar­get­ing and re­mov­ing the cues that trig­ger that habit”. He re­calls how cov­er­ing boxes of tit­bits with black pa­per helped a fam­ily mem­ber of his stop munch­ing mind­lessly as it tamped down the ap­peal of the snacks.</p>
    <p>Prac­tis­ing mind­ful­ness also helps one cling on to the ben­e­fits of whole­some new rou­tines.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­men­tal psy­chol­o­gist Jes­lyn Lim from Mind Cul­ture, a cen­tre that pro­vides var­i­ous ther­a­pies to im­prove men­tal health, says: “Form­ing and main­tain­ing new habits re­quire ef­fort and mo­ti­va­tion. Hav­ing a con­crete plan and be­ing mind­ful through­out the day can aid you sig­nif­i­cantly.”</p>
    <p>She sug­gests ap­ply­ing the same mind­ful­ness – when wash­ing hands thor­oughly – to de­lib­er­ately mak­ing sound de­ci­sions, whether it is choos­ing healthy meals or set­ting aside time to en­joy your new hobby of knit­ting.</p>
