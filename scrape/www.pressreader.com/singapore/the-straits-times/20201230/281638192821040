    <p>Health­care work­ers will be the first here to get vac­ci­nated against Covid-19, as Sin­ga­pore’s ex­er­cise be­gins to­day at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases (NCID).</p>
    <p>More health­care in­sti­tu­tions will fol­low in the com­ing weeks, with pub­lic health­care in­sti­tu­tions and pri­vate hos­pi­tals to ar­range for their staff to be vac­ci­nated pro­gres­sively within their premises.</p>
    <p>El­derly peo­ple aged 70 and above will get the vac­cine shots from next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Other Sin­ga­pore­ans and longterm res­i­dents who are med­i­cally el­i­gi­ble for vac­ci­na­tion will be next in line, with more de­tails to be shared later.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced on Sun­day that its ex­pert com­mit­tee’s recommenda­tions on the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy for Sin­ga­pore, which are spe­cific to the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine, were ac­cepted in full.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee had rec­om­mended that peo­ple at high risk of be­ing in­fected, in­clud­ing health­care work­ers and front-line work­ers, should be given first pri­or­ity for vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic re­ceived its first ship­ment of vac­cines from Pfiz­erBioNTech on Dec 21, with sub­se­quent stocks ex­pected to ar­rive in batches over sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is the first coun­try in Asia to ob­tain the vac­cine, which has been ad­min­is­tered in other coun­tries such as Bri­tain, Canada and the United States.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine has been au­tho­rised by the Health Sci­ences Author­ity, and the ex­pert com­mit­tee has en­dorsed its use in Sin­ga­pore for in­di­vid­u­als aged 16 and above.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine has demon­strated a high ef­fi­cacy of 95 per cent and its safety pro­file is con­sis­tent with the high stan­dards set for other reg­is­tered vac­cines used in im­mu­ni­sa­tion against other diseases, the com­mit­tee noted.</p>
    <p>While vac­ci­na­tion is not a sil­ver bul­let that can end the pan­demic im­me­di­ately, it is a key en­abler to get­ting Sin­ga­pore back to a safer state of af­fairs, the MOH has said.</p>
    <p>It will com­ple­ment the likes of safe man­age­ment mea­sures, test­ing and con­tact trac­ing, to help Sin­ga­pore mit­i­gate the spread of the virus and keep com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion low.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment on Sun­day, MOH noted that com­pre­hen­sive vac­ci­na­tion cov­er­age in the pop­u­la­tion will in­di­rectly pro­tect those who can­not be in­oc­u­lated due to med­i­cal rea­sons.</p>
    <p>In the longer term, wider vac­ci­na­tion among the com­mu­nity will also en­able Sin­ga­pore to re­open fur­ther as a so­ci­ety and as an econ­omy, and ex­pe­dite its re­cov­ery from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tion will be of­fered on a free and vol­un­tary ba­sis for all Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents, who are likely to be able to get vac­ci­nated by the end of next year if there are no un­fore­seen dis­rup­tions to vac­cine ship­ments.</p>
    <p>The ex­pert com­mit­tee has said that it will make fur­ther recommenda­tions on other groups to be pri­ori­tised for vac­ci­na­tion, such as those who live or work in set­tings where there is po­ten­tial for rapid trans­mis­sion and large out­breaks, as more vac­cines be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>El­derly peo­ple aged 70 and above will get the vac­cine shots from next Fe­bru­ary. Other Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents who are med­i­cally el­i­gi­ble for vac­ci­na­tion will be next in line, with more de­tails to be shared later.</p>
