    <p>MEL­BOURNE The Aus­tralian Open will start on Feb 8, three weeks later than sched­uled, the ATP Tour yes­ter­day con­firmed in a re­lease of its up­dated cal­en­dar for next year.</p>
    <p>The start of the main draw of the tour­na­ment was orig­i­nally slated for Jan 18 and Ten­nis Aus­tralia has been locked in drawn-out ne­go­ti­a­tions with the lo­cal gov­ern­ment over Covid-19 health mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The state of Vic­to­ria yes­ter­day recorded a 48th straight day with­out a case of com­mu­nity trans­mit­ted Covid-19 but many health re­stric­tions re­main in place in Mel­bourne, and the Aus­tralian bor­der re­mains all but shut to in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Men’s qual­i­fy­ing for the year’s first Grand Slam would take place in Doha from Jan 10-13 be­fore play­ers move to Mel­bourne to quar­an­tine for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Play­ers, in­clud­ing reign­ing Aus­tralian Open cham­pion No­vak Djokovic, had warned or­gan­is­ers against ex­pect­ing com­peti­tors to go straight from a lengthy pe­riod of quar­an­tine into Grand Slam matches.</p>
    <p>The ATP tour­na­ment sched­uled to take place in Ade­laide has been moved to Mel­bourne to be played in the week com­menc­ing Jan 31 along­side an­other men’s warm-up tour­na­ment in the city.</p>
    <p>A short­ened ver­sion of the ATP Cup men’s team tour­na­ment, which made its de­but ear­lier this year in Bris­bane, Perth and Syd­ney, will take place in Mel­bourne from Feb 1-5 be­fore the hard-court Grand Slam be­gins the fol­low­ing Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The ATP sea­son will now open with tour­na­ments in Del­ray Beach, Florida and An­talya in Tur­key from Jan 5-13 be­fore prepa­ra­tions for the trip to Mel­bourne Park be­gin.</p>
    <p>The Auck­land Clas­sic and New York Open will not take place next year, the ATP an­nounced, while the Ma­ha­rash­tra Open in In­dia and Rio Open in Brazil will be resched­uled.</p>
    <p>“The re­con­fig­ured cal­en­dar for the start of the 2021 sea­son rep­re­sents a huge col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­fort across ten­nis, un­der chal­leng­ing cir­cum­stances,” said ATP chair­man An­drea Gau­denzi.</p>
    <p>“Health and safety will con­tinue to be paramount as we nav­i­gate the chal­lenges ahead.”</p>
    <p>This will be the first time in 34 years that the Aus­tralian Open will be staged out­side of Jan­uary. Fans are ex­pected to be al­lowed at Mel­bourne Park.</p>
