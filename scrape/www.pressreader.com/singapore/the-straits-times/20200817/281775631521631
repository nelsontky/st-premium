    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said Post­mas­ter Gen­eral Louis DeJoy was try­ing to stream­line the US Postal Ser­vice (USPS) and “make it great again” – de­fend­ing the man at the cen­tre of an es­ca­lat­ing scan­dal over al­le­ga­tions of elec­toral in­ter­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump made the re­marks dur­ing a press con­fer­ence at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Satur­day after ac­cu­sa­tions from Demo­cratic law­mak­ers that Mr DeJoy is gut­ting the USPS to help se­cure the Pres­i­dent’s re-elec­tion in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on the one hand en­dorsed Mr DeJoy – call­ing the wealthy Re­pub­li­can donor a “very tal­ented man” who was work­ing hard to “stop the tremen­dous losses that have taken place for many, many years”.</p>
    <p>“He wants to make the Post Of­fice great again,” Mr Trump said, play­ing off his 2016 elec­tion cam­paign slo­gan.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Mr Trump tried to put some dis­tance be­tween him­self and es­ca­lat­ing prob­lems with the US mail agency that have erupted since Mr DeJoy took over.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what he’s do­ing,” he said at one point when asked about Mr DeJoy’s cuts, which have sparked wide­spread de­liv­ery de­lays and spread dis­quiet across the coun­try. “I didn’t speak to him about it,” he said at an­other.</p>
    <p>Mr DeJoy’s down­siz­ing drive – which has in­cluded curbs on over­time and re­moval of post boxes – has be­come a ma­jor con­cern for Democrats who ac­cuse Mr Trump of as­phyx­i­at­ing the Post Of­fice to dis­rupt the Nov 3 elec­tion, which is ex­pected to fea­ture an un­prece­dented wave of postal vot­ing due to the fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Even some Repub­li­cans have ex­pressed worry amid re­ports that med­i­cal de­liv­er­ies were be­ing slowed.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, the USPS in­spec­tor­gen­eral said it would be in­ves­ti­gat­ing Mr DeJoy’s cuts – along with po­ten­tial con­flicts of in­ter­est re­lated to Mr DeJoy’s own­er­ship of mil­lions of dol­lars in stock in USPS ri­vals and cus­tomers, ac­cord­ing to a fi­nan­cial dis­clo­sure form filed by his wife.</p>
    <p>Early on Satur­day, protesters gath­ered out­side Mr DeJoy’s up­scale con­do­minium in Wash­ing­ton to chant, bang pots and wave plac­ards that de­nounced him as “Post­mas­ter Sabo­teur”. One sign read, “De­liver DeMail, De­pose DeJoy”.</p>
    <p>Pressed dur­ing his news con­fer­ence on why the Post Of­fice was be­ing starved of funds, Mr Trump said Democrats were block­ing a cash in­fu­sion dur­ing stalled ne­go­ti­a­tions over a new round of eco­nomic aid to ease the im­pact of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In fact, Democrats have been push­ing to hand ex­tra money to the Post Of­fice so it can han­dle the an­tic­i­pated elec­tion-re­lated in­flux.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is dis­cussing whether to bring back law­mak­ers from re­cess to deal with the postal ser­vice cri­sis, ac­cord­ing to a Demo­cratic aide.</p>
    <p>Ms Pelosi, who has been lob­bied by some House mem­bers to act, dis­cussed the pos­si­bil­ity of re­turn­ing to Wash­ing­ton to take leg­isla­tive ac­tion on a call with other House lead­ers on Satur­day, said the aide, who de­clined to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The House could be brought back within the next two weeks, ac­cord­ing to pol­i­tics news site Politico.</p>
    <p>As con­cerns mount over the USPS’ abil­ity to han­dle the ex­pected surge in bal­lots, states are work­ing to en­sure their res­i­dents’ votes count.</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia last week asked its Supreme Court to push back its dead­line for ac­cept­ing mail-in bal­lots. In a court fil­ing, it cited a let­ter from a USPS of­fi­cial to the state warn­ing of “a risk that bal­lots re­quested near the dead­line un­der state law will not be re­turned by mail in time to be counted un­der your laws”.</p>
    <p>The Wash­ing­ton Post re­ported on Fri­day that sim­i­lar no­tices were sent to 45 other states and the District of Columbia.</p>
    <p>Mr Jon Tester, a Demo­cratic se­na­tor from Mon­tana, has asked Mr DeJoy in writ­ing to ex­plain re­ports that the USPS was re­mov­ing mail­boxes from towns in the state. Late Fri­day, a USPS spokesman told CNN that re­moval of mail­boxes was be­ing halted in 16 states, in­clud­ing Mon­tana, and parts of two oth­ers.</p>

Mr DeJoy&#x2019;s down&#xAD;siz&#xAD;ing drive has sparked con&#xAD;cerns as the Novem&#xAD;ber elec&#xAD;tion is ex&#xAD;pected to fea&#xAD;ture an un&#xAD;prece&#xAD;dented wave of postal vot&#xAD;ing due to the pan&#xAD;demic.</p>
