    <p>NON-FIC­TION</p>
    <p>YOUNG MONGOLS: FORG­ING DEMOC­RACY IN THE WILD, WILD EAST</p>
    <p>By Aubrey Me­nard</p>
    <p>Penguin Books/Pa­per­back/</p>
    <p>305 pages/$34.13/</p>
    <p>Avail­able at bit.ly/YoungMon­gol­s_AM</p>
    <p>An “in­vis­i­ble coun­try”: That is what po­lit­i­cal scientist Dr Elad Segev, who stud­ies in­ter­na­tional news flows, would dub the re­mote ter­ri­tory of Mon­go­lia, one of the least­fea­tured places when it comes to in­ter­na­tional news cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tral Asian coun­try is known more for its ex­otic land­scapes, no­madic in­hab­i­tants and as the birth­place of an­cient war­rior-ruler Genghis Khan (bet­ter known to Mon­go­lians as Ching­gis Khan) than for the chal­lenges con­fronting its con­tem­po­rary so­ci­ety, which tran­si­tioned from com­mu­nist rule to democ­racy af­ter a peace­ful rev­o­lu­tion in 1990.</p>
    <p>But, as this well-re­searched book by first-time au­thor Aubrey</p>
    <p>Me­nard demon­strates, Mon­go­lia’s brim­ming crop of young ac­tivists are tack­ling chal­lenges that also con­front the global com­mu­nity, such as sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues, fake news and dis­in­for­ma­tion, as well as gen­der equal­ity. The is­sues high­lighted in the book – such as ten­sions be­tween Chris­tian con­ser­vatism and LGBT (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der) rights, or how toxic def­i­ni­tions of mas­culin­ity im­pact gen­der re­la­tions – will likely strike a chord with Sin­ga­porean read­ers.</p>
    <p>But while it is earnestly writ­ten and ex­ten­sive in its scope, the book has prob­lems with pac­ing.</p>
    <p>As the chap­ters are struc­tured by topic, rather than theme, some seg­ments lack nar­ra­tive pull and may be­gin to feel like a long laun­dry list of the work of var­i­ous ac­tivists and the causes they cham­pion in Mon­go­lia.</p>
    <p>Some of the most en­gross­ing chap­ters fea­ture in­di­vid­u­als who have worked with the gov­ern­ment on projects and are able to pro­vide an in­sider’s take on pol­icy prob­lems; they are an­a­lyt­i­cal and able to pro­vide a lo­cal per­spec­tive on is­sues.</p>
    <p>In a chap­ter on en­vi­ron­men­tal chal­lenges, for in­stance, Me­nard is able to sys­tem­at­i­cally draw the links be­tween bu­reau­cratic fail­ures, Mon­go­lia’s unique hous­ing sys­tem and harsh en­vi­ron­men­tal cli­mate to show how the coun­try of 3.2 mil­lion peo­ple – the least densely pop­u­lated on the planet – has, iron­i­cally, be­come home to the world’s most pop­u­lated cap­i­tal city.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate chap­ter on nat­u­ral re­sources, Me­nard – an Amer­i­can ex­pert on democ­racy and po­lit­i­cal tran­si­tions – casts a sober­ing light on how the weak rule of law, cor­rup­tion and pol­i­tics stand in the way of ac­tivists, work­ers and so­cial en­trepreneur­s who are look­ing for so­lu­tions to long­stand­ing pol­icy prob­lems.</p>
    <p>At times, how­ever, her pas­sion for cap­tur­ing the fer­vent ide­al­ism of the young ac­tivists can slide into in­dul­gent ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, she por­trays a lawyer’s work in ad­vo­cat­ing for both LGBT peo­ple and eth­nic mi­nori­ties as ground-break­ing, as it is in­ter­sec­tional in na­ture.</p>
    <p>How­ever, such ac­tivism – built on the premise that the over­lap of var­i­ous so­cial iden­ti­ties con­trib­utes to sys­temic dis­crim­i­na­tion against a per­son – has gained wide­spread mo­men­tum over the years and is not con­sid­ered ex­cep­tional.</p>
    <p>The chap­ter on education also strug­gles to link dis­parate top­ics, first delv­ing into IT skills be­fore flit­ting to the ru­ral-ur­ban di­vide, eth­nic mi­nori­ties, peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, arts education and sex­u­al­ity education.</p>
    <p>Still, if what you are seek­ing is a com­pre­hen­sive in­tro­duc­tion to youth ac­tivism in Mon­go­lia, this book will more than sat­isfy your needs.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Ig­nit­ing The In­ter­net: Youth And Ac­tivism In Post-au­thor­i­tar­ian South Korea by Kang Ji-yeon (Univer­sity of Hawaii Press, 2016, $44.90, avail­able at bit.ly/ITIn­ter­netSK_Kang), which ex­am­ines the new wave of South Korean youth ac­tivism that orig­i­nated on­line in 2002.</p>
