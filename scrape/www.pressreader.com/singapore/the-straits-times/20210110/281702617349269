    <p>When Alibaba founder Jack Ma crit­i­cised the Chi­nese fi­nan­cial sys­tem dur­ing a speech at a high-pro­file fo­rum last Oc­to­ber, in­dus­try watch­ers braced them­selves.</p>
    <p>Ant Group, the fin­tech ti­tan also founded by Mr Ma, was days away from a record US$37 bil­lion (S$49 bil­lion) list­ing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Bund Sum­mit i n Shang­hai on Oct 24, the out­landish bil­lion­aire – who usu­ally speaks off the cuff – launched a blis­ter­ing at­tack on China’s banks and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Read­ing from pre­pared re­marks, he said they op­er­ated with a “pawn shop men­tal­ity” of re­quir­ing col­lat­eral be­fore agree­ing to lend money.</p>
    <p>It set in course a now fa­mil­iar se­ries of events, in­clud­ing the pulling of Ant’s ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO), the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the com­pany by fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tors, and most re­cently spec­u­la­tion of whether Mr Ma has been de­tained.</p>
    <p>While in­dus­try in­sid­ers and watch­ers say the po­ten­tial back­lash makes it un­likely the tech bil­lion­aire has been ar­rested, the big­ger ques­tion that re­mains is the ram­i­fi­ca­tions on Ant.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma has not been seen in public since he gave that fate­ful 20-minute-long speech.</p>
    <p>His fight­ing words also marked the start of a down­ward trend in Alibaba share prices, los­ing some US$218.5 bil­lion in mar­ket value, or about US$10.9 bil­lion for ev­ery minute of Mr Ma’s ora­tion.</p>
    <p>And in Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s China, where open dis­sent – much less crit­i­cism – is frowned upon, ru­mours are rife that Mr Ma, a Com­mu­nist Party mem­ber, has been de­tained in the fash­ion of fel­low bil­lion­aire Ren Zhiqiang.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren, a prop­erty ty­coon, went miss­ing last year af­ter writ­ing an al­legedly crit­i­cal es­say about Mr Xi. He later emerged in po­lice cus­tody and was sen­tenced to 18 years in prison for cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>The ru­mour mill went into over­drive af­ter Mr Ma did not show up in the fi­nale of his own show, Africa’s Busi­ness He­roes, where he is a judge. His pro­file has also been taken off the pro­gramme’s web­site.</p>
    <p>But an ex­ec­u­tive at a fi­nan­cial ser­vices firm, who is in charge of govern­ment re­la­tions, said it was un­likely that Mr Ma had been de­tained.</p>
    <p>“He’s prob­a­bly j ust ly­ing low now, as you would do, try­ing to cal­cu­late his next move,” said the ex­ec­u­tive, who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>“We were all shocked when (the govern­ment) stopped the IPO. But to move per­son­ally against Jack Ma is re­ally some­thing else al­to­gether be­cause he is such a public fig­ure.”</p>
    <p>But his fame could al­ways work against him, said Pro­fes­sor Jef­frey Wasser­strom of the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia Irvine, who spe­cialises in Chi­nese his­tory.</p>
    <p>“(Fame) could pro­vide a bit of pro­tec­tion, but in an au­thor­i­tar­ian sys­tem where the leader is the fo­cus of a per­son­al­ity cult, fame and pop­u­lar­ity can ac­tu­ally make some­one more – rather than less – vul­ner­a­ble to at­tack,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Given the tight flow of in­for­ma­tion out of Zhong­nan­hai, the cen­tral govern­ment of­fices, there is no clar­ity about how the Alibaba founder is viewed within Mr Xi’s in­ner cir­cle, said Pro­fes­sor Wasser­strom.</p>
    <p>Since its found­ing in a Hangzhou apart­ment over two decades ago to help Chi­nese busi­nesses sell in­ter­na­tion­ally, the com­pany has grown into one of China’s largest tech be­he­moths.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Ant and Alibaba, the busi­nesses cover nearly ev­ery facet of Chi­nese daily life: e-com­merce, food de­liv­ery, e-pay­ments and even trans­port ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Even con­tact trac­ing apps used dur­ing the coron­avirus out­break are hosted on the Ali­pay app.</p>
    <p>Through­out, Mr Ma has main­tained that the con­glom­er­ate is a tech­nol­ogy com­pany and that Ant, the fi­nan­cial ser­vices spin-off, should be viewed as a tech com­pany and thus not sub­jected to the same sort of reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny as the reg­u­lar fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>This did not go down well in Bei­jing: The cen­tral bank and the bank­ing, in­surance, se­cu­ri­ties and for­eign ex­change reg­u­la­tors sum­moned Mr Ma and Ant ex­ec­u­tives for a dress­ing-down on Nov 2 last year.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing day, the Shang­hai Stock Ex­change sud­denly pulled Ant’s highly an­tic­i­pated de­but, send­ing shock waves through­out the fi­nan­cial world. It led to the firm later stop­ping its Hong Kong dual list­ing sched­uled for Nov 5.</p>
    <p>On Christ­mas Eve last year, Alibaba, which runs pop­u­lar e-com­merce web­site Taobao and TMall, con­firmed that it was be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by Chi­nese an­titrust au­thor­i­ties for anti-mo­nop­oly vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“Alibaba will ac­tively co­op­er­ate with the reg­u­la­tors on the in­ves­ti­ga­tion. Com­pany busi­ness oper­a­tions re­main nor­mal,” the group said in a state­ment. The group did not re­spond to mul­ti­ple in­ter­view re­quests from The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Yet in­dus­try watch­ers say this has been long over­due: There are sim­i­lar anti-mo­nop­oly laws al­ready in place in Europe.</p>
    <p>China’s Anti-Mo­nop­oly Law was in­tro­duced in 2008, but it started to be en­forced in earnest only last year, when the Anti-Mo­nop­oly Com­mis­sion in­ves­ti­gated Ant Group’s pay­ments arm Ali­pay and Ten­cent’s WeChat Pay.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, there is a high chance of more tech firms com­ing un­der scru­tiny as reg­u­la­tors start en­forc­ing the rules, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor An­gela Zhang, direc­tor of the Cen­tre for Chi­nese Law at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>As for Alibaba, the firm is likely to be asked to stop mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices such as ask­ing ven­dors to choose be­tween it­self and ri­val WeChat Pay and pe­nal­is­ing mer­chants who do not sell ex­clu­sively on its plat­form.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese an­titrust reg­u­la­tor is un­likely to im­pose struc­tural reme­dies such as break­ing up Alibaba – I don’t see a strong le­gal ba­sis for the reg­u­la­tor to do that,” said Prof Zhang.</p>
    <p>“More­over, struc­tural reme­dies would cause too much pain to the firm and erode in­vestors’ con­fi­dence in Chi­nese tech firms.”</p>
    <p>They are also likely to be sub­jected to a large fine – up to 10 per cent of the past year’s rev­enue – which will dwarf the 500,000 yuan (S$102,000) fine they were slapped with last year for fail­ing to seek reg­u­la­tory ap­proval and for mis­lead­ing pric­ing and pro­mo­tions.</p>
    <p>And while Alibaba is no longer tied to Mr Ma’s per­sonal for­tunes – he stepped down from the board in 2019 – he has ma­jor­ity con­trol of fi­nan­cial firm, Ant.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, all there is now is spec­u­la­tion, isn’t it? We live in an era where any­thing can hap­pen, so we can only wait and see (what hap­pens to Jack Ma),” said the fi­nan­cial ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
