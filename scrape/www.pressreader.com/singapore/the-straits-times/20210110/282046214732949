    <p>This Jan­uary, few people will feel com­fort­able with New Year res­o­lu­tions of los­ing weight or find­ing a new hobby.</p>
    <p>As we move for­ward, anx­ious to leave the old year be­hind, we are all marked in vary­ing de­grees by the ex­pe­ri­ences of the past chaotic months, and the suf­fer­ing ex­pe­ri­enced by so many in the world.</p>
    <p>The com­ing year brings the cer­tainty of a vac­cine, and once in­oc­u­lated, most people will ex­pect to re­turn to nor­mal life.</p>
    <p>On one level this will hap­pen, but in the larger con­text the world we know will be changed by all we have ex­pe­ri­enced. Too many lives have been shat­tered, too many people now live with the dis­com­fort of un­cer­tainty, filled with unan­swer­able ques­tions about the true na­ture of their lives.</p>
    <p>There is a grow­ing view that we are ap­proach­ing the end of an era, and our pan­demic dis­as­ter is has­ten­ing this. An­thro­pol­o­gist Wade Davis, in an ar­ti­cle for the magazine Rolling Stone ti­tled The Un­rav­el­ling Of Amer­ica, de­scribes how Covid-19 sig­nals this end.</p>
    <p>“Never in our lives have we ex­pe­ri­enced such a global phe­nom­e­non. For the first time in the his­tory of the world, all of hu­man­ity, in­formed by the un­prece­dented reach of dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy, has come to­gether, fo­cused on the same ex­is­ten­tial threat, con­sumed by the same fears and un­cer­tain­ties.”</p>
    <p>He goes on to point out: “Pan­demics and plagues have a way of shift­ing the course of his­tory, and not al­ways in a man­ner im­me­di­ately ev­i­dent to the sur­vivors… The Covid pan­demic will be re­mem­bered as such a mo­ment in his­tory, a sem­i­nal event whose sig­nif­i­cance will un­fold only in the wake of the cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>Our world of old-fash­ioned niceties has dis­in­te­grated, but the world we are mov­ing to­wards is not yet here. Mean­while, in a global rite of pas­sage, we tread the space be­tween the old world and the new.</p>
    <p>In­dige­nous and tribal cul­tures un­der­stand this lim­i­nal space and do not fear it. They un­der­stand that trans­for­ma­tion is the aim of life, the aim of the soul.</p>
    <p>Young people in such so­ci­eties par­tic­i­pate in rite of pas­sage ini­ti­a­tions, which usu­ally mark their jour­ney from child­hood to adult­hood. Most ini­ti­a­tions in­volve the death of the ego, and a sym­bolic de­scent into in­ner dark­ness to shed an ob­so­lete form. It is recog­nised that the old must die be­fore re­birth can oc­cur, and a new stage of life can be­gin.</p>
    <p>The great po­lit­i­cal and social jug­ger­nauts of change that shape our col­lec­tive jour­ney as a people are largely be­yond our in­di­vid­ual com­pre­hen­sion.</p>
    <p>Yet, the great Rus­sian novelist Leo Tol­stoy de­clared af­ter writ­ing his mas­ter­piece War And Peace that it is the re­sponse of the com­mon per­son – at­tend­ing to their ev­ery­day lives in the wake of crises or great events – that fur­thers the un­con­scious mo­tions of his­tory, just as much as the Genghis Khans and Hitlers who ap­pear to con­trol his­tor­i­cal forces.</p>
    <p>In the small­ness of our in­di­vid­ual lives, we can do no more than look af­ter our­selves as his­tory’s cur­rents swirl about us.</p>
    <p>Yet, how we han­dle our­selves amidst the tur­bu­lence, in­con­se­quen­tial as that may ap­pear, adds its weight to the col­lec­tive whole.</p>
    <p>And if there is fear and dark­ness in th­ese times, we must search for a crack of light. The singer Leonard Cohen fa­mously says just this in his song, An­them: “There is a crack in ev­ery­thing, that’s how the light gets through.”</p>
    <p>In per­sonal dark­ness, that light can some­times seem hard to find, yet there are lives that shine forth in ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>The quite ex­tra­or­di­nary He­len Keller must rank among one of the most re­mark­able and up­lift­ing of such ex­am­ples. Born a healthy, nor­mal baby in 1880 in Alabama, she con­tracted a mys­te­ri­ous ill­ness at 19 months that left her deaf and blind.</p>
    <p>In her au­to­bi­og­ra­phy, The Story Of My Life, orig­i­nally pub­lished in 1903, she re­calls that her ear­li­est years were lived “at sea in a dense fog”, fight­ing against what felt like in­vis­i­ble hands hold­ing her down as her need for com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­came ur­gent.</p>
    <p>The true dark­ness of such af­flic­tion is im­pos­si­ble for us to com­pre­hend. At six, with the help of de­voted teach­ers, she be­gan the strug­gle to­wards her own per­sonal light.</p>
    <p>At first, words were spelt onto her hand, but it was dif­fi­cult for her to com­pre­hend ei­ther this</p>
    <p>“fin­ger play” or even the con­cept of words. She re­counts the won­der of first un­der­stand­ing the idea of wa­ter when her teacher thrust her hand un­der a flow­ing tap, and spelled wa­ter onto her other hand.</p>
    <p>Sud­denly, she writes, she felt “a misty con­scious­ness as of some­thing for­got­ten – a thrill of re­turn­ing thought, and some­how the mys­tery of lan­guage was re­vealed to me”.</p>
    <p>Later, Braille gave her ac­cess to knowl­edge and learn­ing, and the ful­fil­ment of her wish for a col­lege ed­u­ca­tion. In 1904, she earned a Bach­e­lor of Arts de­gree, from Rad­cliffe Col­lege, Har­vard Univer­sity, the first deaf-blind per­son to grad­u­ate from col­lege.</p>
    <p>Af­ter read­ing the Greek epic, the Iliad, while still at Har­vard, she says: “I am con­scious of a soul sense that lifts me above the nar­row, cramp­ing cir­cum­stances of my life.”</p>
    <p>Later, she worked tire­lessly for people with dis­abil­i­ties all over the world, forg­ing a life for her­self as an au­thor, po­lit­i­cal ac­tivist and lec­turer.</p>
    <p>He­len Keller walked an ex­cep­tion­ally harsh per­sonal jour­ney to tran­scen­dence. Yet, all liv­ing things, in one way or another, un­dergo this life-death-re­birth cy­cle, whether cater­pil­lar to but­ter­fly, tree to coal, seed to flower, or our own per­sonal jour­neys through trauma, grief and hard­ship to un­der­stand­ing and peace.</p>
    <p>As a world, we ap­pear to have for­got­ten the power of tran­scen­dence, and its ac­com­pa­ny­ing aware­ness of the sa­cred.</p>
    <p>Un­less we can recog­nise and wit­ness this el­e­ment in our own per­sonal jour­neys, we can­not fully com­pre­hend the mean­ing or pur­pose of our lives.</p>
    <p>As a world, we are at such a place at this mo­ment in time. How we go for­ward, and what will evolve, de­pends upon how hard in our present dark­ness we seek that heal­ing and trans­for­ma­tive crack of light.</p>
    <p>In the small­ness of our in­di­vid­ual lives, we can do no more than look af­ter our­selves as his­tory’s cur­rents swirl about us. Yet, how we han­dle our­selves amidst the tur­bu­lence, in­con­se­quen­tial as that may ap­pear, adds its weight to the col­lec­tive whole.</p>
    <p>nine nov­els, whose themes ex­am­ine the con­flict of cul­tures and the search for iden­tity.</p>
