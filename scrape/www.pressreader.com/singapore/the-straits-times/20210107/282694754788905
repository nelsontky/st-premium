    <p>• The Grammy Awards cer­e­mony due to take place on Jan 31 has been resched­uled to March 14 be­cause of the coro­n­avirus surge in Los An­ge­les, or­gan­is­ers said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Record­ing Academy and broad­caster CBS said in a joint state­ment that the cer­e­mony to present the high­est hon­ours in the mu­sic in­dus­try had been de­layed af­ter talks with health ex­perts and mu­si­cians.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter thought­ful con­ver­sa­tions with health ex­perts, our host and artistes sched­uled to ap­pear, we are reschedul­ing the 63rd An­nual Grammy Awards to be broad­cast on Sun­day, March 14, 2021,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“The de­te­ri­o­rat­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Los An­ge­les, with hos­pi­tal ser­vices be­ing over­whelmed, ICUs hav­ing reached ca­pac­ity, and new guid­ance from state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments have all led us to con­clude that post­pon­ing our show was the right thing to do,” it added.</p>
    <p>The post­pone­ment was ear­lier re­ported by Rolling Stone mag­a­zine and en­ter­tain­ment web­site Va­ri­ety, and the Record­ing Academy had told its mem­bers in a memo that the new date would be March 21.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a spike in coro­n­avirus deaths and hos­pi­tal ad­mis­sions. Gyms, hair sa­lons and restau­rants have been shut down and res­i­dents have been urged to stay at home as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Bey­once leads nom­i­na­tions for this year’s Gram­mys with nine nods in a Novem­ber an­nounce­ment that was over­shad­owed by a stun­ning snub for Cana­dian mu­si­cian The Weeknd.</p>
    <p>The Record­ing Academy had not an­nounced who would be per­form­ing at the show, which is usu­ally a three-hour mix of live per­for­mances by top in­ter­na­tional mu­si­cians and speeches by win­ners.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers of the an­nual Os­cars cer­e­mony last year moved this year’s pre­sen­ta­tion to April from late Fe­bru­ary be­cause of the pan­demic, while this year’s Golden Globes cer­e­mony was moved to Feb 28 from its usual early Jan­u­ary date.</p>
    <p>Other ma­jor awards shows, in­clud­ing tele­vi­sion’s Em­mys and the MTV Video Mu­sic Awards, went ahead last year with a mix of live, pre-recorded and so­cially dis­tanced ap­pear­ances by celebri­ties but with­out an au­di­ence.</p>
