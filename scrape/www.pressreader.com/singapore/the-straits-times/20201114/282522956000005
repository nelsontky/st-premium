    <p>The bulk of United Over­seas Bank’s 26,000-strong work­force will have the op­tion to work re­motely two days a week once Covid-19 re­stric­tions are lifted.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows a six-month re­view of the bank’s work pat­terns, workspaces and work­force tech­nol­ogy tools, where 65 per cent of bank roles – all of which are non-cus­tomer-fac­ing – were as­sessed to be suited to re­mote work­ing. The bank took in feed­back from its em­ploy­ees across its global net­work on the strains of hav­ing their homes turned into their of­fices dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic. The move is also in line with broader com­mu­nity sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>Walt Dis­ney on Thurs­day said it swung to a loss in the just-ended quar­ter as the global pan­demic hit its theme parks and cin­ema op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The me­dia en­ter­tain­ment pow­er­house re­ported a loss of US$710 mil­lion (S$958 mil­lion) in the pe­riod end­ing Oct 3, com­pared with a US$777 mil­lion profit in the same pe­riod a year ago. Rev­enue slumped 23 per cent from last year to US$14.7 bil­lion. But Dis­ney shares jumped in af­ter-hours trade on news that its stream­ing tele­vi­sion ser­vice Dis­ney+ had hit 73 mil­lion sub­scribers in a pos­i­tive sign as it shifts to com­pete with ri­vals like Net­flix.</p>
