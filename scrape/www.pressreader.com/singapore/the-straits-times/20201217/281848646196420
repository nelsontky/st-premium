    <p>Last month, an Aus­tralian La­bor MP, Dr An­drew Leigh, marched into Par­lia­ment car­ry­ing a huge bun­dle of white pa­pers mark­ing the re­sults of the largest on­line pe­ti­tion in the na­tion’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>The pe­ti­tion, ini­ti­ated by for­mer La­bor prime min­is­ter Kevin Rudd, called for a royal com­mis­sion to in­quire into the me­dia em­pire run by</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia-born ty­coon Rupert Mur­doch. It said Mr Mur­doch’s ex­ten­sive con­trol of Aus­tralia’s me­dia was be­ing used to at­tack po­lit­i­cal and busi­ness op­po­nents, in­tim­i­date crit­ics, dam­age free speech, and “un­der­mine pub­lic de­bate”.</p>
    <p>In just a month, the pe­ti­tion at­tracted 501,876 sig­na­tures, in­clud­ing that of an­other for­mer prime min­is­ter, Mr Mal­colm Turn­bull, a for­mer Lib­eral MP who used to be a fierce op­po­nent of Mr Rudd’s.</p>
    <p>Tabling the pe­ti­tion in Par­lia­ment, Dr Leigh said: “Di­verse sources of re­li­able, ac­cu­rate and in­de­pen­dent news isn’t a lux­ury – it’s fun­da­men­tal to a healthy democ­racy.”</p>
    <p>Both Mr Rudd and Mr Turn­bull have sav­agely at­tacked the Mur­doch em­pire, whose news­pa­pers cover about two-thirds of the na­tion’s print read­ers. This leaves Aus­tralia with one of the most heav­ily con­cen­trated me­dia own­er­ship lev­els in the demo­cratic world.</p>
    <p>Mr Mur­doch worked as a jour­nal­ist in Aus­tralia be­fore build­ing a global me­dia em­pire that in­cludes Bri­tain’s The Times and Fox News in the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr Rudd de­scribed the Mur­doch em­pire’s im­pact in Aus­tralia as a “can­cer on democ­racy”, say­ing it has spread cli­mate change de­nial­ism and pro­moted anti-China hys­te­ria.</p>
    <p>“Mur­doch print me­dia… helps set the agenda and the tone and the fram­ing and the pa­ram­e­ters of the na­tional po­lit­i­cal de­bate,” he told ABC News ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“Is this poi­son­ing our democ­racy? I be­lieve over time, it is.”</p>
    <p>The hefty pe­ti­tion did not lead to a royal com­mis­sion, but has led to the estab­lish­ment of a Se­nate in­quiry that is ex­am­in­ing Aus­tralia’s me­dia di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>The in­quiry is not specif­i­cally tar­get­ing Mr Mur­doch’s em­pire but is ex­am­in­ing me­dia di­ver­sity and reli</p>
    <p>abil­ity. It is also ex­am­in­ing the im­pact of global sites such as Face­book, Google and Twit­ter on the me­dia sec­tor.</p>
    <p>A Greens MP who helped to se­cure the in­quiry, Ms Sarah Han­son-Young, said: “Aus­tralians are wor­ried about the health of our me­dia land­scape, and as a Par­lia­ment we should act.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mur­doch’s News Corp said the com­pany would con­struc­tively en­gage with the in­quiry.</p>
    <p>The pe­ti­tion and in­quiry have led to a grow­ing pub­lic fo­cus on Mr Mur­doch’s in­flu­ence over Aus­tralian de­bate. Some com­men­ta­tors have ex­pressed con­cern about the right-wing slant of com­men­ta­tors on News Corp’s Sky News Aus­tralia tele­vi­sion chan­nel, liken­ing it to Fox News, which has been a staunch sup­porter of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a re­cent heated ex­change on ABC Tele­vi­sion’s Q&A pro­gramme, Mr Turn­bull said News Corp had dam­aged Western democ­racy and had de­scended into “pure pro­pa­ganda”.</p>
    <p>“The cam­paign on cli­mate de­nial is just stag­ger­ing and has done enor­mous dam­age to the world, to the global need to ad­dress global warm­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Kelly, ed­i­tor-at-large at Mr Mur­doch’s The Aus­tralian news­pa­per, said in re­sponse that News Corp car­ried a range of views on cli­mate change. “We have many pub­li­ca­tions that are ded­i­cated to pro­mot­ing the cause of cli­mate change and rad­i­cal ac­tion on cli­mate change,” he said.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers at News Corp sug­gested Mr Rudd was a hyp­ocrite, say­ing he had courted Mr Mur­doch dur­ing his po­lit­i­cal as­cent.</p>
    <p>Mr David Pen­berthy, a for­mer ed­i­tor of Sydney’s The Daily Tele­graph, a mass-cir­cu­la­tion News Corp tabloid, said Mr Rudd had been des­per­ate to “in­gra­ti­ate him­self with our com­pany”.</p>
    <p>“This push for a royal com­mis­sion is driven less by facts and more by the shared men­tal state of Rudd and his new side­kick Mal­colm Turn­bull,” he wrote in The Aus­tralian.</p>
    <p>“It is psy­cho­log­i­cally more palat­able for them to as­cribe their demise not to their own im­pe­ri­ous­ness, pol­icy fail­ure or in­abil­ity to con­sult and lis­ten, but a sin­is­ter ex­ter­nal con­spir­acy.”</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing on Twit­ter, Mr Rudd wrote: “I will not be in­tim­i­dated by Mur­doch’s bul­ly­ing one bit.”</p>
    <p>The Se­nate in­quiry is due to com­plete its re­port by next Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The pe­ti­tion and in­quiry have led to a grow­ing pub­lic fo­cus on Mr Mur­doch’s in­flu­ence over Aus­tralian de­bate. Some com­men­ta­tors have ex­pressed con­cern about the right-wing slant of com­men­ta­tors on News Corp’s Sky News Aus­tralia tele­vi­sion chan­nel, liken­ing it to Fox News, which has been a staunch sup­porter of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
