    <p>Job seek­ers are fac­ing tougher com­pe­ti­tion this year with un­em­ploy­ment on the rise.</p>
    <p>Given that one of the first im­pres­sions a po­ten­tial em­ployer will have of you will be from your re­sume, a well-pre­pared doc­u­ment can help you stand out.</p>
    <p>But what kind of re­sume works if you are a mid-ca­reerist laid off from a sec­tor like tourism where the jobs have dried up, and need to ap­ply for a po­si­tion in a to­tally dif­fer­ent field, like e-com­merce? Or what if you had spent the past few years study­ing for a qual­i­fi­ca­tion that no longer seems as cut­ting edge, as Covid-19 up­ends en­tire in­dus­tries?</p>
    <p>Here are some tips on mak­ing your skills and ex­pe­ri­ence work for you, from ca­reer coaches Yeo Kia Li of NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute, and Za­rina Abu Bakar of Work­force Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>1. Start with a pro­fes­sional sum­mary</p>
    <p>This gives a brief overview – four to five lines – of your back­ground, skills and ex­pe­ri­ence, and should com­mu­ni­cate your sell­ing points and key strengths, says Ms Za­rina.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple would be “Re­gional op­er­a­tions and mar­ket­ing pro­fes­sional with global brands for over a decade, driv­ing go-to-mar­ket sales and suc­cess­fully im­ple­ment­ing business process de­sign and work­flow op­ti­mi­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>2. Have a “core com­pe­ten­cies” sec­tion</p>
    <p>This should high­light trans­fer­able and mar­ketable skills rel­e­vant to the job you are ap­ply­ing for. Th­ese can be both hard skills spe­cific to a job or industry (for ex­am­ple, pro­fi­ciency with soft­ware or ma­chin­ery) and soft skills (for ex­am­ple, com­mu­ni­ca­tion, lead­er­ship and cus­tomer ser­vice).</p>
    <p>It helps to get through the ap­pli­cant track­ing sys­tems soft­ware used by some big­ger com­pa­nies, which search for keywords in re­sumes.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo also rec­om­mends us­ing a Mi­crosoft Word doc­u­ment un­less the re­cruiter spec­i­fies oth­er­wise, as some hu­man re­source tools have dif­fi­cul­ties de­tect­ing keywords in PDF files.</p>
    <p>3. Use a func­tional re­sume for­mat</p>
    <p>Es­pe­cially use­ful for ca­reer switch­ers and fresh grad­u­ates, a func­tional re­sume for­mat – in­stead of just a chrono­log­i­cal list of pre­vi­ous em­ploy­ment – plays up your trans­fer­able skills and ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>For work­ing adults, draw th­ese from your past jobs.</p>
    <p>For fresh grad­u­ates, high­light knowl­edge and skills gained from your stud­ies, any distinc­tive school projects, vol­un­teer work, lead­er­ship po­si­tions and achieve­ments, in­clud­ing awards or schol­ar­ships.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo says func­tional skills that em­ploy­ers look for in the cur­rent un­cer­tain cli­mate in­clude be­ing able to de­vise new money-mak­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, pre­serve ex­ist­ing rev­enue streams and save the com­pany money. Fa­mil­iar­ity with project man­age­ment sys­tems and on­line work­flow com­mu­ni­ca­tion tools to hire, train and man­age re­mote teams well is also in de­mand.</p>
    <p>FOR CA­REER SWITCH­ERS: EM­PHA­SISE TRANS­FER­ABLE SKILLS</p>
    <p>If you are ap­ply­ing for a job in a new sec­tor, Ms Za­rina says you should state clearly in the sum­mary your in­ten­tion to make a ca­reer switch and ex­plain how your trans­fer­able skills and ex­pe­ri­ence from past jobs would con­trib­ute to­wards the new job and com­pany.</p>
    <p>Add a short de­scrip­tor af­ter your job ti­tle to high­light your trans­fer­able skills, says Ms Yeo. For ex­am­ple, if you had been a soft­ware en­gi­neer and you now want to work in project man­age­ment, you could write your job ti­tle as “soft­ware en­gi­neer (with a heavy em­pha­sis on project man­age­ment)”.</p>
    <p>Find keywords re­lated to your de­sired job that match up with your pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­ence and in­clude them through­out your re­sume.</p>
    <p>Th­ese keywords help you move past elec­tronic fil­ters. “A re­sume full of ac­count­ing keywords will have a hard time get­ting past fil­ters for a job in mar­ket­ing,” says Ms Yeo.</p>
    <p>You can also in­clude non-work-re­lated ex­pe­ri­ence such as pro­fes­sional as­so­ci­a­tion mem­ber­ships, vol­un­teer­ing, in­tern­ships or part­time con­sult­ing, if they are rel­e­vant to the new sec­tor or role.</p>
    <p>In­clude any cour­ses or pro­fes­sional cer­ti­fi­ca­tions rel­e­vant to the new sec­tor and job un­der an “education qual­i­fi­ca­tions” sec­tion, even if the course is on­go­ing (in­di­cate the year it will be com­pleted), says Ms Za­rina. “This is a strong sig­nal to prospec­tive em­ploy­ers that you are in­deed se­ri­ous in mak­ing the switch to the new job and sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>You can in­clude a chrono­log­i­cal por­tion later in the re­sume to pro­vide an overview of your past work ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>FOR FRESH GRADS:</p>
    <p>PLAY UP WHAT YOU’VE LEARNT</p>
    <p>High­light the knowl­edge and skills gained from your stud­ies, in­tern­ships or work at­tach­ments.</p>
    <p>In­tern­ships and at­tach­ments can be listed in a chrono­log­i­cal por­tion of your re­sume. In­clude de­tails such as the job scope, projects and any achieve­ments made for the host em­ployer, says Ms Za­rina.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo says that it is also im­por­tant to in­di­cate how the skills and knowl­edge ac­quired through your ex­tra-cur­ric­u­lar ex­pe­ri­ence will en­able you to be a strong con­trib­u­tor or prob­lem solver in the role you are ap­ply­ing for.</p>
    <p>4. Quan­tify achieve­ments</p>
    <p>In­di­cate ma­jor ca­reer achieve­ments from your pre­vi­ous jobs and ex­plain how you can pro­vide a similar impact for your fu­ture em­ployer, says Ms Za­rina.</p>
    <p>Th­ese could in­clude any quan­tifi­able ef­fort on your part to im­prove the pro­duc­tiv­ity, qual­ity or ef­fi­ciency of work, or gen­er­ate rev­enue for the com­pany, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>But be se­lec­tive. A re­sume should not be a dump­ing ground for ev­ery mi­nor ac­com­plish­ment in your ca­reer, she adds.</p>
    <p>5. In­clude tem­po­rary roles</p>
    <p>Ms Za­rina says tak­ing on tem­po­rary jobs or trainee­ships dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod can help bridge a gap in your re­sume and pro­vide networking op­por­tu­ni­ties. Job seek­ers can also keep their skills sharp, es­pe­cially soft skills such as time man­age­ment, prob­lem solv­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, some­one from the ho­tel industry who took on a tem­po­rary job in a su­per­mar­ket can high­light his peo­ple skills as it is a peo­ple­fac­ing job. Or he could have honed his at­ten­tion to de­tail in an in­ven­tory-re­lated role, and peo­ple man­age­ment skills in a su­per­vi­sory role.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo adds that you should demon­strate the value of the tem­po­rary ex­pe­ri­ence and present th­ese as strengths, a can-do spirit, and hav­ing no prob­lem do­ing seem­ingly “hum­ble” work.</p>
    <p>6. Net­work in dig­i­tal spa­ces</p>
    <p>Findings have shown that a strong pres­ence on LinkedIn and a re­sume that in­cludes a link to a com­pre­hen­sive and dy­namic LinkedIn pro­file lead to far more in­ter­views or call­backs, says Ms Yeo. “It is not dif­fi­cult to imag­ine that hir­ing man­agers would be more im­pressed when ap­pli­cants con­tinue to be ac­tive in pro­fes­sional cir­cles and are com­mit­ted to networking in tur­bu­lent times like the cur­rent one.”</p>
    <p>She also sug­gests cre­at­ing a video re­sume to fur­ther stand out. This means do­ing a pro­fes­sional and per­sonal pre­sen­ta­tion in a video.</p>
