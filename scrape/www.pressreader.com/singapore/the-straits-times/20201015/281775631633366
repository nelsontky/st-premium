    <p>Ex­pert opin­ion on just how to use anti­gen tests is evolv­ing and re­mains the sub­ject of debate. Switzer­land, where new cases have spiked to about 1,500 a day from as low as three in June af­ter schools re­opened, is only now val­i­dat­ing the ac­cu­racy of the rapid tests.</p>
    <p>ZURICH/BER­LIN • Coun­tries strain­ing to con­tain a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 are turn­ing to faster, cheaper but less ac­cu­rate tests to avoid the de­lays and short­ages that have plagued ef­forts to di­ag­nose and trace those in­fected quickly.</p>
    <p>Ger­many, where cases jumped by 4,122 on Tues­day to 329,453 in to­tal, has se­cured nine mil­lion so­called anti­gen tests per month that can de­liver a re­sult in min­utes and cost about €5 (S$8) each. That would, in the­ory, cover more than 10 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The United States and Canada are also buy­ing mil­lions of tests, as is Italy, whose re­cent ten­der for five mil­lion tests at­tracted of­fers from 35 com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s Robert Koch In­sti­tute now rec­om­mends anti­gen tests to com­ple­ment ex­ist­ing molec­u­lar poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests, which have be­come the stan­dard for as­sess­ing ac­tive in­fec­tions but which have also suf­fered short­ages as the pan­demic over­whelmed lab­o­ra­to­ries and out­stripped man­u­fac­tur­ers’ pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>PCR tests de­tect ge­netic ma­te­rial in the virus while anti­gen tests de­tect pro­teins on the virus’ sur­face, though both are meant to pick up ac­tive in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>An­other type of test, for an­ti­bod­ies that the body pro­duces in re­sponse to an in­fec­tion, can help tell if some­body has had Covid-19 in the past. Like PCR tests, anti­gen tests re­quire an un­com­fort­able nasal swab. They can also pro­duce more “false neg­a­tives”, prompt­ing some ex­perts to rec­om­mend that they only be used in a pinch.</p>
    <p>Still, the alarm­ing rise in new virus in­fec­tions glob­ally has health of­fi­cials des­per­ately pur­su­ing more op­tions as the win­ter in­fluenza sea­son looms.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion re­ported more than two mil­lion new cases last week, bring­ing the to­tal world­wide to 37 mil­lion, with more than one mil­lion deaths from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“These point-of-care tests could make a big dif­fer­ence,” said Dr Ger­ard Krause, direc­tor of the epi­demi­ol­ogy depart­ment at Ger­many’s Helmholtz Cen­tre for In­fec­tion Re</p>
    <p>search. Dr Krause said low-pri­or­ity pa­tients – those with­out symptoms – could ini­tially be screened with anti­gen tests, leav­ing the more ac­cu­rate PCR tests for those show­ing signs of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>NO TEST, NO FLIGHT</p>
    <p>Anti­gen tests have al­ready gained trac­tion in the travel in­dus­try. Ital­ian air­line Al­i­talia is of­fer­ing RomeMi­lan flights ex­clu­sively for pas­sen­gers with neg­a­tive tests and Ger­many’s Lufthansa has an­nounced sim­i­lar test­ing plans.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic’s vast scale has strained the abil­ity of coun­tries to test all of their cit­i­zens, mak­ing it dif­fi­cult to track the twist­ing paths of in­fec­tion com­pre­hen­sively and pre­vent a resur­gence.</p>
    <p>In the US, for ex­am­ple, re­liance on au­to­mated PCR ma­chin­ery over the sum­mer left many pa­tients frus­trated as they waited for a week or more for re­sults.</p>
    <p>Test­ing in Europe has also suf­fered glitches.</p>
    <p>France car­ries out more than a mil­lion tests a week but its free-for</p>
    <p>all test­ing pol­icy has led to long queues and de­lays in re­sults, prompt­ing French re­searchers to come up with a test that they say can pro­duce re­sults in 40 min­utes, with­out us­ing a swab.</p>
    <p>Italy does be­tween 800,000 and 840,000 tests a week, more than dou­ble April’s lev­els, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>But a gov­ern­ment ad­viser, Univer­sity of Padua mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy pro­fes­sor An­drea Crisanti, said the coun­try needs two mil­lion tests a week to re­ally get on top of the virus.</p>
    <p>In the Nether­lands, where in­fec­tion rates are among Europe’s high­est, the gov­ern­ment has been scram­bling to ex­pand weekly test­ing and lab ca­pac­ity to 385,000 by next week from 280,000 now. The tar­get is nearly half a mil­lion tests a week by De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>‘GOLD STAN­DARD’</p>
    <p>The var­i­ous test­ing hitches high­light a co­nun­drum for gov­ern­ments: how to get peo­ple back to work while trac­ing the virus within the pop­u­la­tion quickly – all with­out run­ning out of sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Swiss di­ag­nos­tics maker Roche an­nounced plans on Tues­day to launch a new anti­gen test by year end that can be pro­cessed on lab ma­chines at up to 300 tests per hour, not count­ing col­lec­tion time.</p>
    <p>Its ri­vals, in­clud­ing Siemens Health­i­neers, Ab­bott Lab­o­ra­to­ries and Bec­ton Dick­in­son, also of­fer nu­mer­ous Covid-19 di­ag­nos­tic tests.</p>
    <p>Roche said its test could be used in places like nurs­ing homes or hos­pi­tals, where fast re­sults could pre­vent a po­ten­tially lethal out­break.</p>
    <p>Ex­pert opin­ion on just how to use anti­gen tests is evolv­ing and re­mains the sub­ject of debate.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land, where new cases have spiked to about 1,500 a day from as low as three in June af­ter schools re­opened, is only now val­i­dat­ing the ac­cu­racy of the rapid tests. “De­ploy­ment of the rapid tests – where it makes sense – will be in­te­grated into our test­ing strat­egy,” a spokesman for the Swiss fed­eral health min­istry said.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, Dr San­dra Ciesek of Univer­sity Clinic in Frank­furt said rapid anti­gen tests could be an op­tion for asymp­to­matic pa­tients plan­ning to visit el­derly pa­tients at nurs­ing homes.</p>
    <p>But peo­ple should re­frain from us­ing them as a de­fin­i­tive sub­sti­tute to judge their in­fec­tion sta­tus.</p>
    <p>“The PCR test re­mains the gold stan­dard,” Dr Ciesek said. “An anti­gen test should only be used as an al­ter­na­tive if PCR is not pos­si­ble in a timely man­ner.”</p>
