    <p>I agree with Mr Seah Yam Meng’s call for a to­tal ban on smok­ing (Set goal of to­tal smok­ing ban, Jan 4).</p>
    <p>The habit is lethal to not just the smok­ers them­selves but also to peo­ple around them.</p>
    <p>Smok­ers are much more likely than non-smok­ers to get heart dis­ease, stroke and lung can­cer. If smok­ers are stricken with such con­di­tions in their later years, the high cost of treat­ment would be a bur­den to their fam­i­lies and even to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>This would not be fair. Mean­while, it is es­ti­mated that about 300 peo­ple die from sec­ond-hand smoke ex­po­sure each year in Sin­ga­pore. This is a pub­lic health con­cern.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, MP Louis Ng called for a ban on res­i­dents smok­ing near win­dows or in the bal­conies of their homes and raised an ad­journ­ment mo­tion on pro­tec­tion against sec­ond-hand smoke in the home.</p>
    <p>Look around and one may of­ten find empty cig­a­rette packs and stubs dis­carded at void decks and walk­ways or out­side cof­fee shops. One may also see driv­ers flick­ing cig­a­rette butts out of their mov­ing cars.</p>
    <p>The so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal costs are high.</p>
    <p>Af­ter over three decades of anti-smok­ing mea­sures, along with pro­hi­bi­tion of smok­ing in many pub­lic places, per­haps it is time to con­sider work­ing to­wards a to­tal ban.</p>
    <p>Many smok­ers who lack the willpower to quit may even wel­come this move.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, we could start the process by rais­ing tobacco taxes to sev­eral times what they are now and ban­ning men­thol-flavoured cig­a­rettes.</p>
