    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong have agreed to cre­ate a two-way air travel bub­ble, the first for both sides, paving the way for leisure and other types of trav­ellers to visit with­out the need to be quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>They will be sub­ject to con­di­tions such as test­ing neg­a­tive for Covid-19, and tak­ing ded­i­cated flights that do not ac­cept tran­sit pas­sen­gers. The num­ber of these flights can be raised or low­ered, de­pend­ing on the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion in both cities.</p>
    <p>There will be no re­stric­tions on itin­er­ary or pur­pose of travel.</p>
    <p>De­tails are still be­ing worked out, but peo­ple could be trav­el­ling be­tween both places in sev­eral weeks.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day called the move a small but sig­nif­i­cant step for the two avi­a­tion hubs, adding that it set the model for more part­ner­ships to come to re­vive air travel.</p>
    <p>Asked what pre­cau­tions will be taken to safe­guard Sin­ga­pore from a spike in Covid-19 cases, Mr Ong said: “There should be a com­mon un­der­stand­ing. We all want to con­trol the virus and the epi­demic, but should there be un­fore­seen cir­cum­stances, a spike, I think we will have to sus­pend (the ar­range­ment).”</p>
    <p>He added that this was an ini­tia­tive which would be done pro­gres­sively, cau­tiously, steadily and safely. “But we have to open up our avi­a­tion sec­tor. We have to try,” he stressed.</p>
    <p>“Both of us are im­por­tant avi­a­tion hubs. We both know that the avi­a­tion hub con­cerns the en­tire econ­omy, not just the avi­a­tion in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Sec­re­tary for Com­merce and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Ed­ward Yau noted that this is the first travel bub­ble ar­range­ment made by Hong Kong, and it is a mile­stone in ef­forts to re­sume nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>“It is sig­nif­i­cant that our two re­gional avi­a­tion hubs have de­cided to col­lab­o­rate to es­tab­lish an air travel bub­ble. It is a safe, care­ful but sig­nifi</p>
    <p>cant step for­ward to re­vive air travel and pro­vide a model for fu­ture col­lab­o­ra­tion with other parts of the world,” Mr Yau added.</p>
    <p>Last month, Mr Yau dis­closed that Hong Kong was look­ing to set up air travel bub­bles with 11 ju­ris­dic­tions such as Sin­ga­pore, Thai­land, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The tourism sec­tor, among the four key in­dus­tries in Hong Kong, made up about 4.5 per cent of its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct in 2018 and em­ployed around 257,000 peo­ple, rep­re­sent­ing about 6.6 per cent of to­tal em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong is the 10th place that Sin­ga­pore has made spe­cial travel ar­range­ments with. There are dif­fer­ent types of agree­ments.</p>
    <p>The first is a uni­lat­eral open­ing – a stand­ing in­vi­ta­tion from Sin­ga­pore to coun­tries that have com­pre­hen­sive pub­lic health sur­veil­lance sys­tems and have suc­cess­fully con­trolled the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries in this group are New Zealand, Brunei, Aus­tralia – ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria state – and Viet­nam. Vis­i­tors have to ap­ply for the Air Travel Pass that al­lows all forms of short­term travel, in­clud­ing leisure travel.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond tier, bi­lat­eral green</p>
    <p>lane ar­range­ments, are for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel.</p>
    <p>China was the first coun­try to es­tab­lish a green lane with Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There are also re­cip­ro­cal green lanes with Malaysia, Brunei, South Korea, Ja­pan and In­done­sia. Ap­pli­ca­tion for travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia will be­gin on Oct 26. For Malaysia, there is a sec­ond scheme in place – the pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment, for longer-term travel for work and busi­ness-re­lated travel.</p>
    <p>For coun­tries hard-hit by the pan­demic, trav­ellers have to serve a 14-day quar­an­tine at ded­i­cated gov­ern­ment fa­cil­i­ties and take a swab test be­fore the end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
