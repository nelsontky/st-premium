    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s Han­jin Group, owner of the na­tion’s largest car­rier Korean Air Lines, is in talks to ac­quire debt-rid­den Asiana Air­lines, the lo­cal me­dia re­ported on Thurs­day, cit­ing un­named in­vest­ment bank­ing sources.</p>
    <p>The Korea Eco­nomic Daily said Han­jin Group has been in talks with Asiana Air­lines’ lead cred­i­tor Korea De­vel­op­ment Bank (KDB), and will be sub­mit­ting a let­ter of in­tent to the bank as early as next week.</p>
    <p>Han­jin Group told Reuters noth­ing has been de­cided, while Asiana Air­lines said it was not aware of such talks.</p>
    <p>KDB said in an e-mail state­ment that talks with Han­jin Group were among the op­tions un­der con­sid­er­a­tion, but the bank also said noth­ing had been de­cided.</p>
    <p>Shares of Asiana Air­lines jumped as much as 25.6 per cent to hit a near seven-month high while Korean Air rose as much as 6.5 per cent in morn­ing trade yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Shares of Han­jin Kal, the hold­ing com­pany of Han­jin Group, were down 8.25 per cent ver­sus a 0.74 per cent rise in the broader Kospi in­dex yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The sale it­self is good news for Asiana Air­lines... Korean Air will likely ben­e­fit from the coun­try’s No. 2 full-ser­vice car­rier drop­ping out of com­pe­ti­tion, while the in­te­gra­tion may bring pos­i­tive out­comes for South Korea’s avi­a­tion in­dus­try,” said KTB In­vest­ment & Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Lee Han-joon.</p>
    <p>A planned sale of Asiana Air­lines,</p>
    <p>South Korea’s sec­ond-largest car­rier, col­lapsed in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Hyundai De­vel­op­ment and bro­ker­age Mi­rae As­set Dae­woo had agreed last De­cem­ber to pur­chase con­trol of Asiana Air­lines for about 2.5 tril­lion won (S$3 bil­lion), but they called for bet­ter terms af­ter the air­line’s debt surged when the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit travel de­mand.</p>
