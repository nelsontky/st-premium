    <p>The cost of air tick­ets between Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong soared yes­ter­day, just a day af­ter plans for a travel bub­ble between the two places were an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The cheap­est price on the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines web­site for a re­turn econ­omy ticket was $558 last night for flights up to the end of December, up from around $400 on Thurs­day. Trav­ellers to ei­ther des­ti­na­tion will not have to serve a quar­an­tine as long as they test neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But it will take more than the re­sump­tion of flights for the travel bub­ble to get off the ground safely, said in­dus­try in­sid­ers, not­ing that the Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties have yet to re­veal full de­tails of the agree­ment, in­clud­ing how and when Covid-19 tests will be car­ried out.</p>
    <p>“It is def­i­nitely a good sign... but we need more clar­ity about how (travel) is go­ing to be car­ried out in a safe man­ner be­fore we can un­der­stand the po­ten­tial busi­ness im­pact on travel agents,” said Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Travel Agents Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Steven Ler.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers will be con­cerned about their health, es­pe­cially fam­i­lies with chil­dren, while how tests will be ad­min­is­tered is also an im­por­tant ques­tion that has to be an­swered, he added. “So, we will have to wait and see. A lot of peo­ple are rush­ing to grab a flight spot first, but we are also see­ing plenty of ques­tions from those who come to us (travel agen­cies) about how to ar­range for their travel.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ali­cia Seah, Dy­nasty Travel’s di­rec­tor of pub­lic re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, noted that col­lab­o­ra­tion with air­lines, tourism boards and lo­cal op­er­a­tors will also be crit­i­cal in kick-start­ing the re­cov­ery of leisure travel.</p>
    <p>“We are still await­ing the launch date to be con­firmed, (but) we are now work­ing on com­pet­i­tive (pack­ages) of air­fares, ac­com­mo­da­tion and theme at­trac­tions.”</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said on Thurs­day that the travel bub­ble could start in a mat­ter of weeks. Any­one who has stayed 14 days in ei­ther ter­ri­tory, re­gard­less of age and na­tion­al­ity, will be el­i­gi­ble to travel.</p>
    <p>Teacher An­der­son Neo, 27, has not seen his Hong Kong-based girl­friend since the end of Jan­uary, but he in­tends to hold off on buy­ing tick­ets un­til a start date for the bub­ble is con­firmed and more in­for­ma­tion is avail­able on Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>“It has been pretty tough since we just got to­gether last year, and this is the long­est we have been sep­a­rated. So, it was a re­lief (to hear about the bub­ble) as we weren’t sure if we could see each other phys­i­cally be­fore 2021,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But re­gard­less of the prices, a ma­jor con­cern would be if the travel bub­ble works. See­ing the cur­rent rush of peo­ple book­ing tick­ets, we are a lit­tle scep­ti­cal if the bub­ble can re­main Covid-free, es­pe­cially if there are peo­ple with a slight ill­ness who... book a flight any­way just so they can travel.”</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said on Thurs­day that the travel bub­ble could start in a mat­ter of weeks. Any­one who has stayed 14 days in ei­ther ter­ri­tory, re­gard­less of age and na­tion­al­ity, will be el­i­gi­ble to travel.</p>
