    <p>Sin­ga­pore should re­quire all em­ploy­ment Pass and S-Pass ap­pli­cants to un­dergo and pay for an as­sess­ment of their ed­u­ca­tional cre­den­tials, so that only ob­jec­tively qual­i­fied for­eign­ers are hired, said Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh.</p>
    <p>He also called for stronger de­ter­rence against un­fair hir­ing, say­ing the coun­try should con­sider en­act­ing anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion laws to pun­ish er­rant com­pa­nies that dis­crim­i­nate against Sin­ga­porean work­ers.</p>
    <p>He made the sug­ges­tions as he spoke dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress about the need to change the way for­eign pro­fes­sion­als are man­aged here, to ad­dress the con­cerns of cit­i­zens who feel ex­cluded from job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>De­vot­ing a sub­stan­tial part of his speech to the is­sue, he said: “If we do not move pur­pose­fully to con­sol­i­date and po­si­tion the Sin­ga­porean PMET (pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian) in a com­pet­i­tive po­si­tion vis a vis the work pass holder, the Govern­ment will not be able to se­cure sup­port for its eco­nomic agenda and take ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties while main­tain­ing a so­cial har­mony.”</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers who work here keep Sin­ga­pore eco­nom­i­cally rel­e­vant and also cre­ate job op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, he said, and many peo­ple are ac­cept­ing of them.</p>
    <p>“But it is pre­cisely be­cause we need for­eign­ers to power our econ­omy that we need to pay more at­ten­tion to Sin­ga­pore work­ers who feel ex­cluded from op­por­tu­ni­ties cre­ated in their home­land,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Leader of the Op­po­si­tion noted that there are cur­rently no crim­i­nal penal­ties for com­pa­nies guilty of un­fair hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Push­ing for more teeth for the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices, or Tafep, he said: “Surely this tempts re­cal­ci­trant em­ploy­ers into try­ing their luck. If they prac­tise un­fair hir­ing, all that hap­pens is that they are stopped from hir­ing un­fairly for two years.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers cur­rently only face crim­i­nal prose­cu­tion if they make false dec­la­ra­tions on fair con­sid­er­a­tion, he noted.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to two re­cent in­stances of firms put on a watch list for hav­ing a large pro­por­tion of for­eign­ers of the same na­tion­al­ity hold­ing PMET jobs – al­most three-quar­ters of PMET jobs at a wealth man­age­ment firm and two-thirds of PMET jobs at a bank – he said it begs the ques­tion of how this could have hap­pened with­out be­ing de­tected.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans may be jus­ti­fied in ask­ing if MOM has tol­er­ated their un­fair hir­ing prac­tices for some time,” he added.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that there could be rea­sons for firms to do so, such as if a bank’s cus­tomers do not speak any of the lan­guages widely used in Sin­ga­pore, and that the is­sue can be com­plex.</p>
    <p>He also noted that some banks have said they could not find enough Sin­ga­pore­ans with the needed ex­per­tise, adding that this could point to gaps in the ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing sys­tems, which must be “found and plugged as soon as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the is­sue is a hot-but­ton one that of­ten gen­er­ates “a lot of heat but very lit­tle light”, he said: “The prob­lem is that we sim­ply do not know enough. And the vac­uum has given space for a more toxic con­ver­sa­tion to fer­ment...To this end, more in­for­ma­tion, and not less, is cer­tainly most help­ful.”</p>
    <p>He urged the Govern­ment to set up a Par­lia­men­tary Se­lect Com­mit­tee to look into the lim­i­ta­tions of the work­force and the needs of the econ­omy, as well as the re­al­i­ties faced by Sin­ga­porean work­ers com­pet­ing for jobs and the con­straints faced by em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh also sug­gested that the Min­istry of Man­power pub­lish names of re­cal­ci­trant em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>“We can then un­der­stand the op­er­at­ing par­a­digm of such busi­nesses and how they in­tend to make the tran­si­tion to fair hir­ing prac­tices.”</p>
