    <p>A method of smug­gling to bring ship­ments of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes into Sin­ga­pore, which was com­mon a few years ago, has made a come­back, said Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Cus­toms. The Straits Times had an ex­clu­sive peek into a Cus­toms raid in Wood­lands last month. Last Thurs­day, ST also ob­served four tonnes of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes marked for dis­posal af­ter their cases were con­cluded.</p>
    <p>The smug­gler may have thought the coast was clear af­ter suc­cess­fully re­ceiv­ing a large ship­ment of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes.</p>
    <p>But the game was up the moment he left his Wood­lands flat to dis­card metal boxes used to hide the du­tyun­paid cig­a­rettes that were de­clared as tea.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms of­fi­cers ar­rested a Chi­nese na­tional and seized 1,000 car­tons of il­licit cig­a­rettes from a four-room flat in Wood­lands in the raid last month.</p>
    <p>This method of smug­gling, which was com­mon a few years ago, has made a come­back, said Cus­toms.</p>
    <p>“Due to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, sup­ply chains glob­ally have been dis­rupted and syn­di­cates would find new ways and means to smug­gle duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes into Sin­ga­pore,” a Cus­toms spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“Cus­toms has ob­served in re­cent weeks that syn­di­cates had at­tempted to smug­gle duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes through LCL (less-thancon­tainer-load) ship­ments, where a con­tainer car­ried goods be­long­ing to mul­ti­ple con­signees, and duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes were hid­den in one of the con­sign­ments.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times had an ex­clu­sive peek into the Cus­toms raid in Wood­lands. Un­known to the smug­gler, the move­ment of the con­tra­band cig­a­rettes was be­ing closely mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>For three hours, an in­tel­li­gence branch of­fi­cer and two Cus­toms of­fi­cers sat in a car, await­ing the sig­nal from other Cus­toms of­fi­cers watch­ing the flat to spring the am­bush.</p>
    <p>As there are many un­knowns in such op­er­a­tions – such as the num­ber of sus­pects present, or if other ve­hi­cles would take over the du­tyun­paid cig­a­rettes and di­vert them to other lo­ca­tions – Cus­toms of­fi­cers need to plan for con­tin­gen­cies and re­act to changes on the ground.</p>
    <p>Within sec­onds of leav­ing his flat, the sus­pect was sur­rounded and hand­cuffed by of­fi­cers wait­ing near the res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>More plain­clothes Cus­toms of­fi­cers ap­peared at the flat to seize and doc­u­ment the con­tra­band stashed in large boxes in the store­room and dry­ing area in the kitchen. Even­tu­ally, the seized cig­a­rettes will all go up in smoke.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, ST ob­served four tonnes of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes marked for dis­posal af­ter their cases were con­cluded. The cig­a­rettes, with an es­ti­mated $1.7 mil­lion in duty evaded, were loaded on 14 wooden pal­lets and ver­i­fied us­ing an RFID scan­ner be­fore be­ing thrown into the rear of a rubbish truck. The truck was then es­corted by Cus­toms of­fi­cers to an in­cin­er­a­tion plant in Tuas South. The of­fi­cers en­sured ev­ery packet was de­stroyed be­fore leav­ing the plant.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try sources told ST that, since April, a short­age in sup­ply has pushed up il­licit cig­a­rette prices by be­tween 30 per cent and 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>A packet of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes now costs more than $7 com­pared with $5 be­fore the Covid-19 out­break. Duty-paid cig­a­rettes cost around $13 a packet.</p>
    <p>Judg­ing by re­ported cases on the Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms web­site, the Covid-19 move­ment re­stric­tions have not dis­cour­aged smug­gling syn­di­cates from op­er­at­ing.</p>
    <p>On May 27, four men were ar­rested with 17,250 car­tons of du­tyun­paid cig­a­rettes at an in­dus­trial building in Yishun Street 23, mak­ing the op­er­a­tion the sin­gle largest haul of il­le­gal cig­a­rettes so far this year. A month later, four men were nabbed with more than 4,000 car­tons of il­licit cig­a­rettes in Tuas South Av­enue 1.</p>
    <p>In the first quar­ter, 43 offenders were ar­rested in 36 op­er­a­tions and more than 185,000 pack­ets of du­tyun­paid cig­a­rettes were seized.</p>
    <p>Last year, 2.9 mil­lion pack­ets of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes were seized – 500,000 pack­ets more than in 2018.</p>
    <p>Cus­toms head of in­tel­li­gence branch, Mr Yee Kwan Yew, said the agency will take strong en­force­ment ac­tion against those in­volved in il­le­gal cig­a­rette ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He told ST: “Given the large price dif­fer­en­tial be­tween the duty-un­paid and duty-paid cig­a­rettes, there will al­ways be in­cen­tives for syn­di­cates to smug­gle duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes even dur­ing the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“These op­er­a­tions con­ducted by Cus­toms help to curb the sup­ply source by ar­rest­ing crim­i­nals re­spon­si­ble for smug­gling the du­tyun­paid cig­a­rettes. It is one of many op­er­a­tions that our of­fi­cers have tire­lessly con­ducted against the cig­a­rette smug­glers.”</p>
