    <p>It would be sim­plis­tic to as­sume that post-Covid-19, land trans­port will go back to pre-pan­demic lev­els in tan­dem with air ac­tiv­i­ties go­ing back to nor­mal, as fun­da­men­tal changes have sur­faced which re­quire a thor­ough re­think of our land use and land com­mute re­quire­ments (Covid-19 op­por­tu­ni­ties may not be here to stay, by Mr Os­man Sidek, Aug 31).</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home is fast gain­ing ac­cep­tance as com­pa­nies start to re­alise the ben­e­fits of re­dis­tribut­ing staff away from the of­fice site.</p>
    <p>The young are not as en­am­oured with own­ing cars as the older gen­er­a­tion may be as they see value and sav­ings in shared use – such as in ride-hail­ing.</p>
    <p>Our vi­sion of pro­duc­ing 30 per cent of our nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally by 2030 will inevitably re­quire land to be com­mit­ted, al­beit on an in­ten­sive scale.</p>
    <p>We can no longer af­ford the lux­ury of plan­ning roads in­de­pen­dently of our other needs.</p>
    <p>We should also keep im­prov­ing the pub­lic trans­port net­work and con­nec­tiv­ity so that there are fewer rea­sons to have to build more roads.</p>
    <p>Mr Os­man sug­gested tak­ing what lit­tle green­ery there is left be­tween roads and build­ings to make way for yet more paved roads – this time for cy­cling.</p>
    <p>We are al­ready an over-paved is­land, and with all that tar­mac re­flect­ing the sun’s heat into our sur­round­ings, it is lit­tle won­der that our am­bi­ent tem­per­a­ture is ris­ing.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung is not wrong to pri­ori­tise re­viv­ing the Changi air hub. It is not only an es­sen­tial part of our econ­omy, but also an im­por­tant part of the global sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>In an­other cri­sis, our air hub will help to keep the na­tion go­ing, but an ex­ten­sive web of roads will not.</p>
