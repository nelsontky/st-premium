    <p>A man was shot in the ab­domen dur­ing a strug­gle with po­lice of­fi­cers who raided a Balestier Road apart­ment yes­ter­day morn­ing to in­ves­ti­gate a se­ries of scams.</p>
    <p>He was try­ing to snatch a re­volver from a po­lice of­fi­cer who had stepped in to stop the sus­pect from as­sault­ing his part­ner when the shot was fired.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old man was taken by paramedics to hospi­tal and is in sta­ble con­di­tion, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>The sus­pect has been ar­rested for vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to de­ter a pub­lic ser­vant from car­ry­ing out his duty, as well as for cheat­ing of­fences and sus­pected drug-re­lated of­fences. He has also been linked to in­ci­dents of un­law­ful assem­bly and Cus­toms-re­lated il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The shoot­ing in­ci­dent hap­pened in an apart­ment at City Suites con­do­minium at 235 Balestier Road at about 1am. Three plain­clothes po­lice­men, armed with re­volvers and hand­cuffs, raided an apart­ment to ar­rest four peo­ple sus­pected of be­ing in­volved in a se­ries of cheat­ing cases.</p>
    <p>When the po­lice en­tered the unit, the man lunged at an of­fi­cer and at­tacked him re­peat­edly, caus­ing him to bleed in the face and fall to the floor.</p>
    <p>The man re­fused to heed a warn­ing from a sec­ond of­fi­cer to stop at­tack­ing the po­lice­man.</p>
    <p>When a sec­ond sus­pect started mov­ing to­wards the first po­lice­man, the sec­ond of­fi­cer drew his re­volver in a bid to stop him from join­ing in the as­sault of his part­ner.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old man then turned to the sec­ond of­fi­cer and tried to snatch his re­volver.</p>
    <p>In the en­su­ing strug­gle, a shot was fired, although this did not stop the man from con­tin­u­ing his vi­o­lent ac­tions, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Backup of­fi­cers even­tu­ally man­aged to sub­due the two hos­tile men.</p>
    <p>Both of­fi­cers were hurt – the first with in­juries to his face and arm, while the sec­ond was wounded on his hands and lips.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said the sec­ond man, 22, has also been ar­rested for vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to de­ter a pub­lic ser­vant from car­ry­ing out his duty.</p>
    <p>As a mat­ter of pro­to­col, the spe­cial in­ves­ti­ga­tion sec­tion is in­ves­ti­gat­ing the of­fi­cer’s dis­charge of the firearm.</p>
    <p>Two women in the flat, aged 33 and 23, said to be the girl­friends of the two men, were also ar­rested for cheat­ing and the sus­pected con­sump­tion of con­trolled drugs.</p>
    <p>Po­lice seized $20,000 of sus­pected crim­i­nal pro­ceeds, drugs and drug-re­lated para­pher­na­lia. The Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau has also been roped in to in­ves­ti­gate the al­leged drug of­fences.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times went to the condo last night, the gate was shut tight and the se­cu­rity guard on duty de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of the condo and those in neigh­bour­ing res­i­den­tial blocks said they were un­aware of the in­ci­dent and read about it only in the evening news.</p>
    <p>They did not hear the gun­shot. Be­sides the four oc­cu­pants in the flat, three oth­ers – two aged 18 and one aged 32 – who are also sus­pected of be­ing in­volved in the cheat­ing cases, were ar­rested be­tween Tues­day and yes­ter­day in sep­a­rate raids.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said they had used vic­tims’ par­tic­u­lars, in­clud­ing credit card de­tails, to ap­ply for and buy hand­sets and phone lines from a telco. They then sold the hand­sets for cash.</p>
    <p>When the telco tried to claim the money from the banks, the trans­ac­tions were re­jected, cost­ing the telco $43,000. The seven vic­tims whose par­tic­u­lars were mis­used, how­ever, were charged for the mo­bile phone sub­scrip­tions.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Com­man­der of Tan­glin Po­lice Di­vi­sion Cheong Chee Ming said the po­lice will use “nec­es­sary force” to ap­pre­hend crim­i­nals.</p>
    <p>He added: “Po­lice of­fi­cers work in a dy­namic en­vi­ron­ment. There are many un­knowns out there and the risks the po­lice of­fi­cers face on a daily ba­sis are very real.</p>
    <p>“They have to be nim­ble and re­act to sit­u­a­tions as they de­velop.”</p>
