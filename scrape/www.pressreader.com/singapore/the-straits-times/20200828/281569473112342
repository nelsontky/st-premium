    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe came to power with a set of na­tional goals. As spec­u­la­tion mounts that he may step down early be­cause of poor health, a key ques­tion is what he has to show for his ef­forts, says as­so­ci­ate editor Ravi Vel­loor (be­low).</p>
    <p>Th­ese should have been cel­e­bra­tory days for Mr Shinzo Abe.</p>
    <p>This week, he passed 2,800 con­tin­u­ous days as Ja­pan’s prime min­is­ter, eras­ing a record set by his grand un­cle, Eisaku Sato. Yet, it has been a while since he went to Ya­m­aguchi pre­fec­ture, his baili­wick on the south-west of Ja­pan’s main is­land, or to his va­ca­tion home in Ya­manashi pre­fec­ture, north of Mt Fuji.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther has he been golf­ing. In­stead, he is said to have gone 150 days with­out a break as he swiv­elled to con­front the pan­demic af­ter what seemed a slow and un­cer­tain start.</p>
    <p>Even for the hard­work­ing Ja­panese, this is a bit of a stretch and the strains are show­ing. Mr Abe has been in and out of hospi­tal lately. In the past few weeks he has mostly been at home, show­ing up in the of­fice only in the af­ter­noons. One news re­port even had him once vom­it­ing blood in his of­fice. This is one ex­hausted man.</p>
    <p>“Pol­i­tics is not about how many days one has stayed in of­fice, but what one has ac­com­plished,” Mr Abe told re­porters af­ter his sec­ond hospi­tal visit. “I have fully de­voted my­self every day to re­al­is­ing the pledges I have made to the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>At 65, which is Mr Abe’s age, you don’t nor­mally call time on a po­lit­i­cal leader’s ca­reer. Mr Joe Bi­den is 77 and he wants to be pres­i­dent of the United States while Mr Don­ald Trump, at 74, wants to stay on in that of­fice. Mr Xi Jin­ping is 67 and said to be eye­ing the ti­tle of chair­man, which would al­low him to pre­side over China for the rest of his life. Mr Abe’s good friend, In­dian premier Naren­dra Modi, is 69 and just into his sec­ond term and clearly eye­ing a third straight five-year in­nings to draw level with the record of found­ing prime min­is­ter Jawa­har­lal Nehru.</p>
    <p>SET­BACKS AND SIL­VER LIN­INGS</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of whether Mr Abe de­cides to fin­ish his cur­rent term which ends next year, or leaves sooner, it is surely time to look both at his nine years in of­fice over two stints and be­yond it.</p>
    <p>To start with, this whim­per of a de­noue­ment clearly isn’t what he had in mind as he vig­or­ously went about plan­ning to host the 2020 Sum­mer Olympic Games, now post­poned to next year thanks to the Covid-19 pan­demic. The Olympics, in­tended to show­case a resur­gent na­tion, were to have been his swan­song and the in­evitable de­lay af­ter the virus out­break, a crush­ing dis­ap­point­ment, there­fore.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, Covid-19 has dented the Ja­panese econ­omy, which had al­ready been slow­ing af­ter a con­sump­tion tax in­crease. Now, the wipe­out in for­eign ar­rivals is adding to a va­ri­ety of other un­cer­tain­ties that led it to shrink nearly 8 per cent from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter in the three months that ended in June, an un­prece­dented contractio­n.</p>
    <p>Host­ing China’s Pres­i­dent Xi for a bi­lat­eral meet­ing was also big on his 2020 cal­en­dar but again not to be.</p>
    <p>And it does not look like amend­ing Ar­ti­cle 9 of Ja­pan’s post­war Con­sti­tu­tion, a key item on his agenda that he saw nec­es­sary for Ja­pan to be a “nor­mal” state with a fully func­tion­ing mil­i­tary, will come to pass on his watch.</p>
    <p>Yet, even as he en­dures th­ese dis­ap­point­ments, there are the sil­ver lin­ings.</p>
    <p>Over­seas vis­i­tors may have dis­ap­peared but do­mes­tic tourism, which ac­counts for more than three-quar­ters of trav­ellers in nor­mal times, has been fairly re­silient. Six of 10 de­par­tures by the big car­ri­ers JAL and ANA are to a do­mes­tic des­ti­na­tion. For all the per­cep­tion of a na­tion des­per­ate for in­ter­na­tional mar­kets to make a good liv­ing, the home econ­omy is of sig­nif­i­cant enough size to stem a wider rout.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, the feared de­fla­tion­ary trap hasn’t ma­te­ri­alised. In­deed, the tar­geted 2 per cent in­fla­tion may yet come about be­cause of the vast amount of money flow­ing into Ja­pan’s econ­omy, achiev­ing what years of loose mon­e­tary pol­icy failed to do, ac­cord­ing to Mr Hideo Hayakawa, the for­mer top econ­o­mist at the Bank of Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>So, too, with China. Be­hind the sur­face dis­ap­point­ment of the can­celled sum­mit, Mr Abe prob­a­bly al­lows him­self a mea­sure of self-sat­is­fac­tion that he is now pretty much in the driv­ing seat of that re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>In­deed, for­eign pol­icy is one area where Mr Abe could be said to have scored well. Mr Trump’s rise to the pres­i­dency clearly caught Ja­pan off guard, as it did so many other na­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Abe re­sponded swiftly, show­ing up in New York’s Trump Tower to see the pres­i­dent-elect and build­ing what seems a trust­ing re­la­tion­ship with the mer­cu­rial Amer­i­can leader.</p>
    <p>Today, Tokyo cred­its it­self with Washington’s sturdy em­brace of the Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific con­cept and the im­por­tance of South-east Asia in the wider Asia pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe and Mr Trump have met nearly a dozen times, spo­ken on the phone at least 30 times and golfed to­gether on four oc­ca­sions, ac­cord­ing to some counts. The phone con­ver­sa­tions, if not golf, were far fewer with Mr Trump’s pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion to tear up US par­tic­i­pa­tion in the</p>
    <p>Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship on his first day in of­fice was no doubt a dis­ap­point­ment but Mr Abe coun­tered by lead­ing the push to build a Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP), mi­nus the US.</p>
    <p>Alarmed at see­ing na­tions such as Aus­tralia push agri­cul­tural and in­dus­trial products into Ja­pan on pref­er­en­tial terms thanks to CPTPP, Mr Trump then rushed to stitch up his own bi­lat­eral trade agree­ment with Tokyo to gain al­most match­ing ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>In April last year when it still wasn’t clear how low US-China ties would go, Mr Abe, seek­ing some room to hedge, had sent Mr Toshi­hiro Nakai, the No. 2 fig­ure in the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP), to Bei­jing. His mis­sion was to de­liver a con­cil­ia­tory let­ter to Mr Xi along with prom­ises of strength­en­ing co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Since then US-China ties have nose­dived and with the re­lent­less pres­sure ap­plied on Bei­jing by Mr Trump and Bei­jing’s stock fall­ing in many global cap­i­tals, it was Mr Xi who needed a grand wel­come in Tokyo. Mr Abe kept Mr Xi guess­ing about his in­ten­tions. Last Novem­ber, the “Al­liance to Safe­guard the Dig­nity and In­ter­ests of Ja­pan” formed by the rul­ing LDP adopted a res­o­lu­tion to urge the Ja­panese PM to not in­vite Mr Xi to visit Ja­pan, if China con­tin­ued the crack­down and sup­pres­sion in Hong Kong. It was not lost on the dis­cern­ing that Mr Abe hap­pens to be the LDP chief as well.</p>
    <p>A MORE CON­FI­DENT NA­TION</p>
    <p>If Mr Abe does de­cide to leave early, he would be leav­ing be­hind a far more con­fi­dent na­tion than the one he was handed, one that no longer feels the need to apol­o­gise pa­thet­i­cally for its wartime ac­tions.</p>
    <p>This year, while Mr Abe sent rit­ual of­fer­ings to Ya­sukuni Shrine for the war dead, he stayed away from a per­sonal visit, as he has for the past few years. But at least two Cab­i­net min­is­ters paid their re­spects in per­son, in­clud­ing En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro Koizumi, 39, who is of­ten men­tioned as a fu­ture premier.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Self-De­fence Forces are now al­lowed to de­ploy over­seas af­ter a con­tro­ver­sial rein­ter­pre­ta­tion of the</p>
    <p>Con­sti­tu­tion – which means they can come to the aid of friendly na­tions such as the US, Aus­tralia and In­dia, mil­i­taries with which the Ja­panese reg­u­larly con­duct wargames. Un­der Mr Abe’s watch, the Ja­panese navy has been sail­ing far­ther and far­ther out­ward. In April 2016, af­ter Viet­nam opened an in­ter­na­tional port in Cam Ranh Bay, Ja­panese guided mis­sile de­stroy­ers made a port call – ahead of even the US Navy. In Oc­to­ber 2018, a Ja­panese he­li­copter car­rier</p>
    <p>– the largest ves­sel in its navy – sailed all the way to Sri Lanka, stop­ping in Sin­ga­pore on the re­turn jour­ney, with­out any eye­brows be­ing raised.</p>
    <p>At the be­gin­ning of his term, key of­fi­cials spoke of plans to build a de­fence-in­dus­trial com­plex that will feed back into the econ­omy. But those plans have had mixed re­sults; New Delhi has grounded plans to buy and build US-2 am­phibi­ous air­craft from Ja­pan and Aus­tralia chose the French firm DCNS for 12 nuclear-pow­ered at­tack sub­marines it is ac­quir­ing. Al­though Ja­pan’s So­ryu subs were reck­oned to be the su­pe­rior ves­sels, Mr Abe seemed re­luc­tant to use gov­ern­ment mus­cle to push the case, se­cretly glad­den­ing sec­tions of his se­cu­rity es­tab­lish­ment that were never too thrilled to share their high tech ves­sel’s se­crets.</p>
    <p>There is, of course, the feel­ing that Mr Abe was just too fo­cused on cul­ti­vat­ing Mr Trump. With the ex­cep­tion of In­dia’s Mr Modi, with whom he seems to share a strong per­sonal chem­istry, he does not seem to have strong bonds with too many lead­ers in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing treated him more like a nui­sance un­til it be­came very ob­vi­ous to Chi­nese rulers that Mr Abe had suc­ceeded in gain­ing Mr Trump’s ear. For this rea­son, his last trip to Bei­jing went markedly well.</p>
    <p>Asian jour­nal­ists have rea­son to chafe that Mr Abe has not been avail­able to them for in­ter­views in the same man­ner that he grants ac­cess to Amer­i­can jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>WAIT­ING IN THE WINGS</p>
    <p>It will take a decade or two per­haps to get the full mea­sure of Mr Abe and his im­pact on Ja­pan. The heights he achieved or the lows he suf­fered – with the Koreas for in­stance – will in some ways be de­ter­mined by how tall his suc­ces­sors in of­fice get to be.</p>
    <p>Party in­flu­en­tials will prob­a­bly see it in their in­ter­est to not project some­one who could po­ten­tially over­ride or ig­nore them, so the prospects for now are for a less as­sertive suc­ces­sor emerg­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Taro Aso, his gaffe-prone Deputy Prime Min­is­ter who once urged older Ja­panese to “hurry up and die”, and Mr Yoshi­hide Suga, the Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary, are into their 70s. That could nar­row the field to the for­mer and cur­rent de­fence min­is­ters, Mr Shigeru Ishiba and Mr Taro Kono, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe once vowed to use his fi­nal term to hand over a “proud and hope-filled Ja­pan” to fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. Sur­veys would in­di­cate that most Ja­panese are sat­is­fied with their lives, even if the dwin­dling birth rate could be said to sug­gest they are less en­thu­si­as­tic about their fu­tures.</p>
    <p>Au­tumn typ­i­cally ar­rives in Ja­pan in mid-Septem­ber. Too bad for the po­lit­i­cal ca­reer of Ja­pan’s reign­ing pa­tri­arch that it seems to have ar­rived a tad early for him.</p>
    <p>It will take a decade or two per­haps to get the full mea­sure of Mr Abe and his im­pact on Ja­pan. The heights he achieved or the lows he suf­fered – with the Koreas for in­stance – will in some ways be de­ter­mined by how tall his suc­ces­sors in of­fice get to be.</p>
