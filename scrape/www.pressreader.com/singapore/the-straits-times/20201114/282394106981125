    <p>The dis­rup­tions on labour force and global sup­ply chains amid the Covid-19 cri­sis have made com­pa­nies and in­dus­tries see the unique value of ro­bots in mit­i­gat­ing the im­pact.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal start-up Cog­ni­cept Sys­tems wants to seize this op­por­tu­nity to make it eas­ier and cheaper for firms to de­ploy ro­bots in ar­eas such as lo­gis­tics and clean­ing, through its tech­nol­ogy and re­mote robot pi­lots.</p>
    <p>Co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Michael Sayre said his firm is able to bridge the gap be­tween tech­nol­ogy ca­pa­bil­i­ties and the needs of robot users to man­age their chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Its hy­brid ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and hu­man robot pi­lot sys­tem helps to im­prove the re­li­a­bil­ity of robotics tech­nol­ogy, which makes it eas­ier for th­ese ro­bots to be de­ployed.</p>
    <p>Cog­ni­cept’s sys­tem cur­rently works with ro­bots de­ployed in places such as hos­pi­tals, lo­gis­tics ware­houses and ho­tels.</p>
    <p>Mr Sayre said its sys­tem re­duces the time and costs re­quired to de­ploy ro­bots, with an es­ti­mated 25 per cent in cost sav­ings.</p>
    <p>Cog­ni­cept ad­dresses prob­lems with robotics de­ploy­ment which are of­ten swept un­der the rug, the 38-year-old Amer­i­can said.</p>
    <p>“When dif­fi­culty arises, it is of­ten viewed as a prob­lem with the cus­tomer or use case, rather than a lim­i­ta­tion of the tech­nol­ogy,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Cog­ni­cept gen­er­ally works with com­pa­nies that build ro­bots, with its tech­nol­ogy and re­mote staff sup­ple­ment­ing the ro­bots’ ex­ist­ing sys­tems, Mr Sayre said.</p>
    <p>Most of its part­ners are in Sin­ga­pore and the United States.</p>
    <p>The firm was es­tab­lished in 2018 with $3,000 in start-up cap­i­tal, and has raised about US$1.4 mil­lion (S$1.9 mil­lion) to date, mostly from ven­ture cap­i­tal firms Antler and Se­quoia Surge.</p>
    <p>While Cog­ni­cept be­came op­er­a­tionally cash-flow pos­i­tive about four months af­ter it was formed, it is still not prof­itable as it is in­vest­ing in its tech­nol­ogy en­hance­ments, Mr Sayre said.</p>
    <p>The start-up, which has 15 em­ploy­ees, has also cre­ated new job op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple from vary­ing back­grounds, re­train­ing them to use hy­brid tools to op­er­ate ro­bots re­motely.</p>
    <p>Cog­ni­cept cur­rently has seven such robot pi­lot em­ploy­ees, who op­er­ate from re­mote work en­vi­ron­ments such as their homes, where they can take over de­ployed ro­bots and op­er­ate them, con­nect­ing to the equip­ment to re­solve is­sues if they arise.</p>
    <p>Cog­ni­cept has gained the most trac­tion in the US so far, but is set to fo­cus more on Sin­ga­pore over</p>
    <p>the next year due to Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the firm at­tracted some in­ter­est from prospec­tive part­ners in the US af­ter a busi­ness de­vel­op­ment push there, but the po­ten­tial cus­tomers held back as they were un­cer­tain about the fu­ture and put their projects on hold.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Sayre is up­beat about the op­por­tu­ni­ties here.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore, as a coun­try, has one of the high­est den­si­ties of ro­bots to hu­mans in the world.</p>
    <p>“With well-main­tained in­fras­truc­ture, a skilled work­force and an or­derly en­vi­ron­ment, Sin­ga­pore is one of the most ideal set­tings for robotics,” he said.</p>
    <p>A sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of the ro­bots us­ing Cog­ni­cept’s sys­tem is in hospi­tal­ity ap­pli­ca­tions – an in­dus­try that has been bat­tered by Covid-19 and travel re­stric­tions glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The firm suf­fered a marked drop in busi­ness in the early days of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But most of th­ese ro­bots are slowly com­ing back into ser­vice, Mr Sayre said, and their de­ploy­ment has ex­panded into other ap­pli­ca­tions such as quar­an­tine de­liv­ery and dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“More broadly, Covid-19-re­lated labour force dis­rup­tions and changes in global sup­ply chains have made many in­dus­tries re­con­sider the unique value that ro­bots of­fer,” he added.</p>
    <p>looks at promis­ing Sin­ga­pore start-ups in the sec­ond part of a four-part se­ries.</p>
