    <p>(−132.61) July 22</p>
    <p>Gains among real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits) and busi­ness trusts helped off­set wor­ries over es­ca­lat­ing United States-China ten­sions to send the lo­cal mar­ket into the black yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times In­dex (STI) gained 17.82 points or 0.7 per cent on the brighter mood to close at 2,612.35, with gain­ers out­pac­ing losers 271 to 170 on trade of 1.38 bil­lion shares worth $1.12 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ax­iCorp chief mar­ket strate­gist Stephen Innes noted: “The im­pact of virus head­lines is re­ced­ing for stock mar­kets, while price ac­tion sug­gests lit­tle care is given about the ris­ing US-China ten­sions.”</p>
    <p>Oanda se­nior mar­ket an­a­lyst Jef­frey Hal­ley said that bar­ring se­vere geopo­lit­i­cal es­ca­la­tion be­tween the US and China, or poor US job­less claims data, “the un­der­ly­ing buy-ev­ery­thing-glob­ally re­cov­ery trade looks set to re­main on course for the rest of the week”.</p>
    <p>The STI’s top per­former was Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust, which ad­vanced 4.9 per cent to $2.13, while its sta­ble­mate Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust was not far be­hind, with a gain of 4.4 per cent to $3.10.</p>
    <p>As­cen­das Reit was also among the top-per­form­ing coun­ters, putting on 2.7 per cent to $3.43.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore was at the bot­tom of the ta­ble, slip­ping 2 per cent to 75.5 cents. It was the most ac­tively traded stock, with over 38 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Other ac­tive coun­ters out­side the in­dex in­cluded Asian Health­care Spe­cial­ists, which surged 38.4 per cent to 24 cents on the back of news that it had en­tered into a part­ner­ship with Te­masek’s Heli­co­nia unit to pur­sue health­care in­vest­ments in South-east Asia. Around 19.5 mil­lion shares changed hands.</p>
    <p>Else­where, the Hong Kong mar­ket ended 0.8 per cent higher as in­vestors shrugged off fears of USChina ten­sions to fo­cus on its buoy­ant tech stock sec­tor. Shares in Shanghai fell 0.2 per cent and snapped a four-day win­ning streak, af­ter the abrupt clo­sure of the Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton. The sec­ondary Shen­zhen bourse was flat.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.56 per cent on news that the coun­try had plunged into re­ces­sion in the sec­ond quar­ter, its worse per­for­mance in more than two decades, as the pan­demic bat­tered ex­ports and curbs paral­ysed fac­tory out­put.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian shares rose 0.3 per cent to build on Wed­nes­day’s 1.3 per cent gain af­ter gas gi­ant San­tos re­ported a record 18.6 per cent rise in quar­terly pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial mar­kets in Ja­pan were closed for a pub­lic hol­i­day.</p>
