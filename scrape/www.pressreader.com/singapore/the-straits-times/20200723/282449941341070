    <p>In the Back To The Fu­ture time-travel movies (1985 to 1990), a big deal was made of not chang­ing the past or fu­ture and meet­ing one’s other self was a def­i­nite taboo.</p>
    <p>There are no such con­cerns in the Ger­man sci­ence-fic­tion se­ries</p>
    <p>Dark. Char­ac­ters from one time­line can set­tle in an­other pe­riod, thus help­ing to cre­ate a fu­ture of which they will be a part. They can even meet and make cryp­tic state­ments to their younger selves.</p>
    <p>But, early in the third and fi­nal sea­son, I won­der if the show is be­gin­ning to col­lapse un­der the weight of its own com­plex­ity.</p>
    <p>A brief re­cap of how things started: One night in 2019, a group of teenage friends, in­clud­ing Jonas (Louis Hof­mann) and Martha (Lisa Vi­cari), head into the woods. Some­thing strange hap­pens near a cave and Martha’s younger brother,</p>
    <p>Mikkel (Daan Len­nard Liebrenz), van­ishes into thin air. Also, Jonas’ fa­ther had taken his own life a few months ear­lier in their small town of Win­den, distin­guished by its nu­clear plant and seething se­crets.</p>
    <p>Over the course of the first two sea­sons, Jonas and oth­ers travel back and forth in time, try­ing to stop things or make things hap­pen as they should – trig­ger­ing ques­tions about causal­ity and free will.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the spot-on cast­ing, it was just about pos­si­ble to keep up as the show jumped around in time, and we were in­tro­duced to younger and older ver­sions of key char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Sea­son 2 ended with a star­tling rev­e­la­tion: the ap­pear­ance of an al­ter­nate Martha – who came not just from a dif­fer­ent time­line, but from a dif­fer­ent world.</p>
    <p>This means that in the third sea­son, the viewer has to work out not only what time pe­riod the show is in, but also which world. It is pretty much im­pos­si­ble, par­tic­u­larly in the penul­ti­mate episode seven when Dark lurches from the past to the fu­ture and back again in short bursts.</p>
    <p>Still, there are some mem­o­rable scenes as un­ex­pected re­unions and deaths take place. And a new, un­named malev­o­lent char­ac­ter turns up, trav­el­ling around with his younger and older selves like some un­holy trin­ity.</p>
    <p>Rather than at­tempt­ing to fol­low ev­ery de­tail, I try to fo­cus on the big ques­tions: Can the apoca­lypse that de­stroys Jonas’ and al­ter­nate Martha’s worlds be stopped? What is the event of ori­gin that needs to be un­done in or­der for this to hap­pen? Is Jonas a pawn or a mas­ter­mind?</p>
    <p>For those who per­se­vere, know that writer-cre­ators Baran bo Odar and Jan­tje Friese have a des­ti­na­tion in mind. It is an au­da­cious and sat­is­fy­ing con­clu­sion which also helps to ex­plain some of the out­landish as­pects of the Dark uni­verse.</p>
    <p>If only the jour­ney to­wards it were less dark and murky.</p>
    <p>Much more light-hearted is the K-drama Was It Love?.</p>
    <p>After all, it stars two of my favourite South Korean comic ac­tors, Song Ji-hyo and Son Ho-jun.</p>
    <p>Song (Emer­gency Cou­ple, 2014) is a fix­ture on the pop­u­lar va­ri­ety show Run­ning Man (2010 to present) and has an easy-go­ing, one-of-the-guys vibe about her.</p>
    <p>And Son, who broke out in rom-com Re­ply 1994 (2013), was mer­rily steal­ing scenes as a former con­man in spy thriller My Se­cret Ter­rius (2018).</p>
    <p>Song plays Noh Ae-jung, a film pro­ducer who is left to clean up the mess after her boss bor­rows a large sum of money from the men­ac­ing former gang­ster Goo Pa-do (Kim Min-joon).</p>
    <p>Goo throws Noh a life­line and of­fers to in­vest in her film – if she can get big-time writer (Son as Oh Dae-oh) and Hol­ly­wood-bound ac­tor Ryu Jin (Song Jong-ho) on board.</p>
    <p>Luck­ily for Noh, both Oh and Ryu Jin were her class­mates from univer­sity, and they had made a movie to­gether back then. Un­for­tu­nately, things ended on a sour note. And oh yes – one of the two men could be the fa­ther of her teenage daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>A third can­di­date is Oh Yeon-woo (Koo Ja-sung), who is still car­ry­ing a torch for Ae-jung after 14 years and just hap­pens to be her daugh­ter’s new teacher.</p>
    <p>Four episodes in, I am still hop­ing for more laughs. But the ban­ter be­tween Song Ji-hyo and Son is promis­ing, as are the po­ten­tial ri­val­ries among the men as they com­pete for her at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>The show lays it on pretty thick at the start about how un­fair life has been to Ae-jung. Like many K-drama hero­ines, she re­fuses to back down in the face of hard­ship and un­like most, she swears like a sailor when pro­voked.</p>
