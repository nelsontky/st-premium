    <p>For those itch­ing to ex­plore a wide va­ri­ety of beauty ser­vices at a steal, newly launched Tropika Club col­lates ev­ery­thing in one place.</p>
    <p>The plat­form has more than 4,000 list­ings of beauty, well­ness and fit­ness of­fer­ings from a grow­ing pool of more than 200 mer­chants. Ser­vices range from mas­sages and eye­lash ex­ten­sions to hair­dress­ing and body wax­ing.</p>
    <p>And at cer­tain times of the day for cer­tain providers, you can snag dis­counts of up to 50 per cent off. For in­stance, a mas­sage at Im­pres­sion Beauty sa­lon in Stam­ford Road is half-price any time be­fore 6pm.</p>
    <p>If the con­cept sounds fa­mil­iar, Tropika Club founder Louis Lye, 33, and his part­ners are not afraid to ad­mit where they found their in­spi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“It orig­i­nated from our use of restaurant reser­va­tion plat­form Eatigo,” he says. “We were im­pressed by the idea of cafes and restau­rants fill­ing up their off-peak ca­pac­ity by of­fer­ing dis­counts. We fig­ured this could also be ap­plied to the beauty, well­ness and fit­ness in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>The banker-by-train­ing in­dulges in beauty and groom­ing pack­ages fre­quently. Over the years, he be­friended sa­lon own­ers and de­vel­oped a better un­der­stand­ing of the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>He saw an op­por­tu­nity to plug a gap when now-de­funct beauty book­ing app Vani­day an­nounced its clo­sure in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>It took six months to de­velop the Tropika Club por­tal and on­board mer­chants. It was launched of­fi­cially at the end of July.</p>
    <p>It was an op­por­tune time to launch and help busi­nesses given the cur­rent cli­mate, says Mr Lye, who works full time as an agency devel­op­ment man­ager with a fi­nan­cial and wealth plan­ning firm.</p>
    <p>“When Covid-19 hap­pened, it dis­rupted many busi­nesses. They wanted to em­brace dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, but many were not sure how to list their ser­vices on­line.</p>
    <p>“We re­alised that while they are aware of the mar­ket and con­sumers shift­ing on­line, they do not un­der­stand in­tri­ca­cies such as SEO (search en­gine op­ti­mi­sa­tion) or back­links. They weren’t sure how to be­gin and were not ready to in­vest large sums to es­tab­lish an on­line pres­ence,” he adds.</p>
    <p>The plat­form hence helps to list mer­chants’ pro­files and ser­vices on­line in one place, with mer­chants free to set off-peak pro­mo­tions. Tropika Club earns a small book­ing fee when a cus­tomer suc­cess­fully books and pays via the por­tal.</p>
    <p>To en­sure au­then­tic­ity, all mer­chant list­ings are in­te­grated with Google Reviews, al­low­ing po­ten­tial cus­tomers to make in­formed de­ci­sions. Users can search for ser­vices by lo­ca­tion too.</p>
    <p>Since its launch, Tropika Club has crossed 1,000 sign-ups. It saw around 700 book­ings within the first month, and the top mer­chant, beauty chain Wel­la­holic, re­ceived 110 book­ings with a to­tal rev­enue of $19,000.</p>
    <p>The dis­counts are a big draw. So far, nine in 10 cus­tomers book ser­vices with off-peak dis­counts, says Mr Lye. “More cus­tomers are work­ing from home and hence are able to in­dulge in off-peak beauty and well­ness ser­vices.”</p>
    <p>Eye­lash sa­lon Perky Lash, which is also listed on other beauty book­ing plat­forms, has seen busi­ness im­prove by 15 per cent since get­ting on board Tropika Club.</p>
    <p>Half of its weekly book­ings at its two out­lets are for off-peak tim­ings, which are cur­rently at 50 per cent off, says the brand’s mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive An­gelina Foo. “It has helped us gain more new book­ings and reach out to new cus­tomers,” she says.</p>
    <p>There are plans to de­velop an app ver­sion of Tropika Club in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Lye says: “We sup­port mer­chants with fea­tured list­ings and pri­or­ity search fea­tures as well as ar­ti­cles, video con­tent cre­ation and so­cial me­dia. It will take us some time to gain trac­tion, but we hope to con­tinue en­gag­ing both mer­chants and cus­tomers on a reg­u­lar ba­sis and grow our user base.”</p>
