    <p>In his nine years here, Song Uiy­oung has carved a rep­u­ta­tion for be­ing a tena­cious mid­fielder in the Sin­ga­pore Premier League.</p>
    <p>This de­ter­mi­na­tion ex­tends off the pitch as the 26-year-old South Korean fi­nally be­came a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent in May on his third at­tempt, with the sup­port of Sport Sin­ga­pore and the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>When he first ap­plied in 2017, the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity told him it did not re­ceive his doc­u­ments, while his 2018 ap­pli­ca­tion was re­jected.</p>
    <p>Thrilled at the news, Song noted it also means he is one step closer to ful­fill­ing his dream of ob­tain­ing</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship and play­ing for the Lions – he has sat­is­fied Fifa’s five-year res­i­dency rule to play for an adopted coun­try at se­nior level.</p>
    <p>He said: “I have grown to be­come a bet­ter foot­baller and a bet­ter per­son, and Sin­ga­pore has played a big part in that.</p>
    <p>“When­ever I go to South Korea for a break, I would feel like com­ing back to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It is a strange feel­ing but this means Sin­ga­pore re­ally feels like home.</p>
    <p>“It would be an hon­our to con­trib­ute by play­ing for Sin­ga­pore. I know it may take an­other two years be­fore I can ap­ply for cit­i­zen­ship, I am will­ing to wait but of course I’m hop­ing ev­ery­thing can be pro­cessed as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Some of Sin­ga­pore’s nat­u­ralised play­ers’ cit­i­zen­ship ap­pli­ca­tions were ex­pe­dited in the past, but th­ese were be­fore Fifa in­creased the res­i­dency re­quire­ment from two to five years in 2008. Since then, the Lions have not added to the nine for­eign-born foot­ballers they have had un­der the For­eign Sports Tal­ent (FST) scheme.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme has been dor­mant in lo­cal foot­ball for the past decade, with China-born for­ward Qiu Li the last to be nat­u­ralised and el­i­gi­ble to play in 2010.</p>
    <p>How­ever, at the 2018 FAS congress, the as­so­ci­a­tion in­di­cated it was open to re­viv­ing the FST scheme, and it is un­der­stood that Song has been on its radar as a prospec­tive nat­u­ralised player.</p>
    <p>Then 18, he was plucked from the Seoul Yeouido Acad­emy and brought here in 2011 to play for Home United (now known as Lion City Sailors) in the Prime League by for­mer coach Lee Lim-saeng.</p>
    <p>Song’s early years were tough as he had to adapt to a new coun­try and lan­guage but he per­se­vered. For­mer Home coach Aidil Sharin switched Song, ini­tially a de­fen­sive mid­fielder, to a more ad­vanced role and he flour­ished. He scored 20 goals in 27 games in 2018, and fol­lowed that with 11 in 25 games last year.</p>
    <p>This sea­son, he has scored twice in four matches.</p>
    <p>Sailors coach Aure­lio Vid­mar felt Song would be a good fit for the Lions with his abil­ity and per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Aus­tralia cap­tain and care­taker coach said: “A mid­fielder who scores reg­u­larly is hard to come by at in­ter­na­tional level.</p>
    <p>“Song also hap­pens to be a great guy and a re­spect­ful guy who gets along well with every­one. “He has shown his de­sire and com­mit­ment by stay­ing here for nine years.</p>
    <p>“He is still rel­a­tively young, but if you are se­ri­ous about im­prov­ing the na­tional team with him, things got to move quicker be­cause other­wise you would be miss­ing out on his best years.”</p>
    <p>THE QUICKER THE BET­TER</p>
    <p>I know it may take an­other two years be­fore I can ap­ply for cit­i­zen­ship, I am will­ing to wait but of course I’m hop­ing ev­ery­thing can be pro­cessed as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
