    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ja­pan will ease en­try re­stric­tions on busi­ness trav­ellers for stays of up to three days, in a bid to re­vive eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity after vis­its from abroad ground to a halt due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, a Ja­panese news­pa­per re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment is plan­ning to re­lax curbs for peo­ple from 30 coun­tries and re­gions with which Ja­pan has strong busi­ness ties, in­clud­ing China, South Korea and Tai­wan, the Yomi­uri daily said, cit­ing uniden­ti­fied govern­ment sources.</p>
    <p>The plan will come into ef­fect next month, the news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is look­ing at grad­u­ally reopen­ing its bor­ders to visi­tors from over­seas, start­ing with busi­ness travel, after it im­posed en­try re­stric­tions to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has agreed with 10 coun­tries and re­gions to al­low en­try to long-term visa hold­ers, and with an­other three for shorter-term stays of around one month. Those are all re­cip­ro­cal ar­range­ments, but the lat­est plan in­volves only en­trants to Ja­pan, the Yomi­uri said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the lat­est plan, busi­ness trav­ellers will be re­quired to take a Covid-19 test, avoid pub­lic trans­porta­tion and crowded lo­ca­tions, and sub­mit an itin­er­ary of their ac­tiv­i­ties dur­ing their stay.</p>
    <p>They will not be sub­ject to 14 days’ quar­an­tine in their ho­tels.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the Yomi­uri</p>
    <p>had re­ported that Ja­pan was plan­ning to re­move a ban next month on over­seas travel to 11 other coun­tries and re­gions, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, Tai­wan, Aus­tralia, New Zealand, China, South Korea, Viet­nam and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Such short-term busi­ness trav­ellers are al­lowed for a month’s stay and can travel back and forth. They also are not sub­ject to 14 days’ quar­an­tine in their ho­tels.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan have launched a “res­i­dence track” for busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives and pro­fes</p>
    <p>sion­als who are work pass hold­ers, in ad­di­tion to an ear­lier re­cip­ro­cal green lane catering mainly to short-term busi­ness trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>The “res­i­dence track” was to be done with the nec­es­sary pub­lic health safe­guards in place, said Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs on Sept 25.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is also look­ing at a plan to al­low Ja­panese who go abroad for busi­ness trips to be con­di­tion­ally ex­empt from hav­ing to serve the 14-day quar­an­tine upon their re­turn, start­ing next month.</p>
