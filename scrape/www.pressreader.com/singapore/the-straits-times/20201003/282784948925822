    <p>• Rap­per Nicki Mi­naj may soon be rap­ping about mother­hood af­ter the Amer­i­can me­dia con­firmed on Thurs­day that she had given birth to her first child on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing is known yet of the baby’s gen­der and name, as Mi­naj made her last so­cial me­dia post in early Au­gust.</p>
    <p>She an­nounced her pregnancy in July when she posted on In­sta­gram photos of her baby bump and used the hash­tag #Preg­gers.</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old sparked spec­u­la­tion of a pregnancy in May when she ad­mit­ted to fans dur­ing a Twit­ter ques­tion-and-an­swer ses­sion that she had been hav­ing “nau­sea and pee­ing non-stop”.</p>
    <p>Mi­naj had shocked fans i n Septem­ber last year when she tweeted that she had “de­cided to re­tire and have my fam­ily”.</p>
    <p>The Chun-Li singer then an­nounced one month later that she had mar­ried mu­sic ex­ec­u­tive Ken­neth Petty, 42, whom she has known since they were teenagers.</p>
    <p>Mi­naj back­tracked a bit on her re­tire­ment when she told Bill­board in De­cem­ber that she still loves mu­sic and in­ter­act­ing with fans, but she wants “to be open to other pos­si­bil­i­ties in my life”.</p>
