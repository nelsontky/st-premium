    <p>LON­DON • Ter­ence Con­ran (right), a renowned de­signer and restau­ra­teur cred­ited with mod­ernising Bri­tish re­tail and decor, has died, his fam­ily said last Satur­day. He was 88.</p>
    <p>Con­ran made his name in the 1960s with the Habi­tat home­fur­nish­ing store, known for its con­tem­po­rary pine fur­ni­ture, brightly coloured fab­rics and taste­ful kitchen­ware, which proved a hit.</p>
    <p>He later be­come chair­man of the Store­house re­tail group, which in­cluded well-known Bri­tish high­street shops such as Mother­care.</p>
    <p>Also pas­sion­ate about food, his first restau­rant, The Soup Kitchen, opened in Lon­don in 1953 and he went on to open many more in the cap­i­tal, in­clud­ing Le Pont de la Tour, Quaglino’s and Mezzo, with his restau­rant in­ter­ests also ul­ti­mately stretch­ing from Paris to New York to Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Mr Tim Mar­low, di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Lon­don’s De­sign Mu­seum, which Con­ran founded, said:</p>
    <p>“Ter­ence Con­ran was in­stru­men­tal in the re­design­ing of post-war Britain and his legacy is huge. He changed the way we lived and shopped and ate.”</p>
    <p>His fam­ily echoed this. “He was a vi­sion­ary who en­joyed an ex­tra­or­di­nary life and ca­reer that rev­o­lu­tionised the way we live in Britain,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Con­ran stud­ied tex­tile de­sign at the Cen­tral School of Arts and Crafts in Lon­don and launched Habi­tat in 1964, dream­ing of pro­vid­ing wellde­signed goods for or­di­nary peo­ple.</p>
    <p>A sin­gle store in west Lon­don grew into a na­tional and in­ter­na­tional chain. He opened his first The Con­ran Shop, which also fo­cused on fur­ni­ture and home decor, in 1972 and was knighted in 1983.</p>
    <p>“I’ve spent a colour­ful life­time work­ing in de­sign and ev­ery­thing re­lated to it, be­cause de­sign is where all the things I have worked on meet,” he wrote in a ques­tio­nand-an­swer sec­tion for the De­sign Mu­seum’s web­site, cred­it­ing his mother as a ma­jor in­spi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“The restau­rants, ho­tels and bars we have de­signed or op­er­ated, the shops, in­te­ri­ors, build­ings, prod­ucts and fur­ni­ture or the books I have writ­ten – de­sign is the one thing that con­nects them all and they add up to what I call a style of life.</p>
    <p>“I also re­alise how lucky I have been in that ev­ery­thing I have ever done for work or busi­ness, I would have done sim­ply for plea­sure.”</p>
    <p>His busi­ness en­ter­prises were not al­ways a suc­cess. In 1990, he stepped down as chair­man of Store­house, which later sold the loss-mak­ing Habi­tat chain to Swedish ri­val Ikea.</p>
    <p>He turned his back on the mass mar­ket to focus on his up­mar­ket re­tail stores and restau­rants.</p>
