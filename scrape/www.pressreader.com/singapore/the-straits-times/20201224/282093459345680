    <p>With more cy­clists hit­ting the roads and parks dur­ing these Covid-19 times, the Sin­ga­pore Cy­cling Fed­er­a­tion’s (SCF) aim to make the sport ac­ces­si­ble and safe for ev­ery­one is a bonus for the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Its Sin­ga­pore Cy­cle Safe pro­gramme launched in 2016 works</p>
    <p>mainly with kinder­gartens, pri­mary and se­condary schools, as well as ju­nior col­leges, to teach youth how to cy­cle and to do so safely in dif­fer­ent en­vi­ron­ments such as park con­nec­tors, roads and cy­cling events.</p>
    <p>To date, about 5,000 stu­dents from 31 schools have par­tic­i­pated in the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The ses­sions are usu­ally held in schools, parks or at the Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub, where they are taught prac­ti­cal skills such as how to nav­i­gate tight cor­ners and make de­ci­sions when fol­low­ing a route.</p>
    <p>SCF gen­eral man­ager Mahipal Singh said: “We want cy­cling to be a core life skill. Cy­cle Safe was in­tro­duced to en­sure that any­one who gets on a bike knows the fun­da­men­tals of be­ing safe while rid­ing.”</p>
    <p>In 2018, the pro­gramme ex­panded its reach to in­clude those with spe­cial needs and dis­abil­i­ties and has since worked with more than 100 stu­dents. The SCF ap­proached cy­cling coach Chris­tian Stauf­fer – who has worked with na</p>
    <p>tional para-cy­clists – for tips, and it has since equipped five of its 20 reg­u­lar pro­gramme coaches with the rel­e­vant skills to train youth with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Coaches are re­quired to come up with a cus­tomised train­ing plan for in­di­vid­u­als to en­sure that the train­ing en­vi­ron­ment is con­ducive.</p>
    <p>The stu­dent to coach ra­tio has been re­duced from about one coach to 15 stu­dents (1:15) to 1:2 or 1:5. Teach­ers and care­tak­ers will also be on-site to of­fer as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>As much as pos­si­ble, the SCF also brings in adap­tive bi­cy­cles for those with cer­tain phys­i­cal dis­abil­i­ties. These in­clude hand bi­cy­cles, which are bi­cy­cles that are moved us­ing arm power.</p>
    <p>Pro­gramme coach Eu­gene Quan said: “I hope it can change (some of the neg­a­tive per­cep­tions that the) pub­lic may have of them and lead to them be­ing ac­cepted into so­ci­ety more read­ily.”</p>
