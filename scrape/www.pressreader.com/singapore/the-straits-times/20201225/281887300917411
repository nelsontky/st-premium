    <p>•</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union were on the cusp of strik­ing a nar­row trade deal yes­ter­day, swerv­ing away from a chaotic fi­nale to a Brexit split that has shaken the 70-year project to forge Euro­pean unity from the ru­ins of World War II.</p>
    <p>While a last-minute deal would avoid the most ac­ri­mo­nious end­ing to the Brexit di­vorce, the United King­dom is head­ing for a much more dis­tant re­la­tion­ship with its big­gest trade part­ner than al­most any­one ex­pected at the time of the 2016 Brexit vote.</p>
    <p>Sources in Lon­don and Brussels said a deal was close as Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son held a late-night con­fer­ence call with his se­nior min­is­ters, and ne­go­tia­tors in Brussels pored over reams of le­gal texts.</p>
    <p>There was no of­fi­cial con­fir­ma­tion of a deal but Mr John­son was ex­pected to hold a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day – just seven days be­fore the UK turns its back on the EU’s sin­gle mar­ket and cus­toms union at 2300GMT on Dec 31 (7am, Jan 1, in Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>Ir­ish For­eign Min­is­ter Si­mon Coveney said a late snag re­lated to fish­ing had de­layed the agree­ment, but that an an­nounce­ment was ex­pected later yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“There is some sort of last­minute hitch” re­lated to “small text” of a fish­eries agree­ment, Mr Coveney told Ire­land’s RTE ra­dio af­ter weeks of hag­gling over just how much fish EU boats should be able to catch in Bri­tish wa­ters. “I had hoped to be talk­ing to you this morn­ing in par­al­lel with big an­nounce­ments hap­pen­ing in both Lon­don and Brussels, but we still ex­pect those later on to­day.”</p>
    <p>The UK for­mally left the EU on Jan 31 this year but has since been in a tran­si­tion pe­riod un­der which rules on trade, travel and busi­ness re­mained un­changed. But from the end of this year, it will be treated by Brussels as a third coun­try.</p>
    <p>If a zero-tar­iff and zero-quota deal is struck, it would help to smooth the trade in goods that makes up half their US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) in an­nual com­merce be­tween the two sides.</p>
    <p>Even with an ac­cord, some dis­rup­tion is cer­tain from Jan 1 next year when Bri­tain ends its of­ten fraught 48-year re­la­tion­ship with a Franco-Ger­man-led project that sought to bind the ru­ined na­tions of post-World War II Europe to­gether into a global power.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of talks that were at times un­der­mined by both Covid-19 and rhetoric from Lon­don and Paris, lead­ers across the EU’s 27 mem­ber states have cast an agree­ment as a way to avoid the night­mare of a “no-deal” exit.</p>
    <p>But Europe’s se­cond-largest econ­omy will still be quit­ting the EU’s sin­gle mar­ket of 450 mil­lion con­sumers.</p>
    <p>When the UK shocked the world in 2016 by vot­ing to leave the EU, many in Europe hoped it could stay closely aligned. But that was not to be.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son, the face of the 2016 Brexit cam­paign, as­serted that since 52 per cent had voted to “take back con­trol” from the EU, he was not in­ter­ested in ac­cept­ing the rules of ei­ther the sin­gle mar­ket or the cus­toms union.</p>
    <p>The EU did not want to give un­fet­tered priv­i­leges to a free­wheel­ing, dereg­u­lated Bri­tish econ­omy out­side the bloc, and so po­ten­tially en­cour­age others to leave.</p>
    <p>The re­sult was a tor­tu­ous ne­go­ti­a­tion on a “level play­ing field” in com­pe­ti­tion – which the EU de­manded in re­turn for ac­cess to its mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In essence, the agree­ment is a nar­row free trade deal sur­rounded by other pacts on fish­eries, trans­port, en­ergy and co­op­er­a­tion in jus­tice and polic­ing.</p>
    <p>De­spite the agree­ment, goods trade will have more rules, more red tape and more cost.</p>
    <p>There will be some dis­rup­tion at ports.</p>
    <p>The UK, which im­ports about US$107 bil­lion more a year from the EU than it ex­ports there, bick­ered un­til the end over fish – im­por­tant for Bri­tain’s small fish­ing fleet but worth less than 0.1 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP).</p>
    <p>In essence, what was the EU’s most am­biva­lent mem­ber is ex­it­ing the bloc’s or­bit on New Year’s Eve for an un­cer­tain fu­ture with a trad­ing re­la­tion­ship that is, at least on pa­per, dis­tant.</p>
    <p>At the stroke of mid­night in Brussels on Dec 31, the EU will lose its prin­ci­pal mil­i­tary and in­tel­li­gence power, 15 per cent of GDP, one of the world’s top two fi­nan­cial cap­i­tals and a cham­pion of free mar­kets that acted as an im­por­tant check on the am­bi­tions of Ger­many and France.</p>
    <p>With­out the col­lec­tive might of the EU, the UK will stand largely alone – and much more re­liant on the United States – when ne­go­ti­at­ing with China, Rus­sia and In­dia.</p>
