    <p>Elec­tric­ity and gas tar­iffs will rise in the next three months but they will still be among the low­est in years.</p>
    <p>About half of Sin­ga­pore’s 1.4 mil­lion house­holds can ex­pect elec­tric­ity tar­iffs to rise by an av­er­age of about 9 per cent from to­day to Dec 31, com­pared with the three months be­fore, SP Group said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But prices are still the sec­ond-low­est they have been in the last three years.</p>
    <p>City Gas said gas tar­iffs will rise in the fourth quar­ter by about 5 per cent for house­holds. They are at their third-low­est lev­els in three years.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try reg­u­la­tor En­ergy Mar­ket Author­ity (EMA) said that the elec­tric­ity tar­iff changes ap­ply to only 53 per cent of house­holds which buy elec­tric­ity from SP Group at the reg­u­lated tar­iff.</p>
    <p>They do not ap­ply to the re­main­ing 47 per cent of house­holds which, as at end June, have switched to a re­tailer in the open elec­tric­ity mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In the last quar­ter of the year, house­holds powered by SP Group will have elec­tric­ity tar­iffs rise from 19.6 cents to 21.43 cents per kilo­watt hour (kwh), be­fore the 7 per cent goods and ser­vices tax (GST).</p>
    <p>This means that the av­er­age monthly elec­tric­ity bill for fam­i­lies liv­ing in four-room Hous­ing Board flats will in­crease by $7.01.</p>
    <p>Gas tar­iffs for house­holds are up by 0.83 cent per kwh, from 16.36 cents last quar­ter to 17.19 cents this quar­ter per kwh, be­fore GST.</p>
    <p>SP Group and City Gas re­view elec­tric­ity and gas tar­iffs quar­terly based on guide­lines set by EMA.</p>
    <p>SP Group said the in­crease in elec­tric­ity prices from this month to De­cem­ber is due to higher en­ergy costs, which de­ter­mine close to 73 per cent of the tar­iffs in the quar­ter, and are paid to power gen­er­a­tion com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Other com­po­nents of the elec­tric­ity tar­iff, such as net­work costs and mar­ket sup­port ser­vices, re­main un­changed.</p>
    <p>City Gas said that gas tar­iffs have also gone up due to fuel cost hikes.</p>
    <p>But ear­lier in the third quar­ter, elec­tric­ity tar­iffs fell by 15 per cent and gas tar­iffs fell by 4 per cent, fol­low­ing a dip in the sec­ond quar­ter as well.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Su­bodh Mhaisalkar, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s En­ergy Re­search In­sti­tute said the Covid-19 pan­demic led to a global de­cline in fuel prices – oil in this case – in March.</p>
    <p>“Eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity is not what it was and oil prices are fore­cast to be low un­til de­mand in­creases to match sup­ply,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with the eas­ing of Covid-19 safety curbs, Prof Mhaisalkar added that most an­a­lysts are pre­dict­ing a mod­est in­crease in fuel prices, and thus an as­so­ci­ated in­crease in elec­tric­ity prices is ex­pected.</p>
    <p>But if elec­tric­ity re­tail­ers rely on green sources of en­ergy such as so­lar, he said, they may be able to keep tar­iffs un­changed even if fuel prices rise.</p>
    <p>One open mar­ket elec­tric­ity re­tailer that is drop­ping prices slightly, in­stead of rais­ing them, is iSwitch.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drew Koscharsky, iSwitch’s chief com­mercial of­fi­cer, said that the com­pany will be low­er­ing the rate of its fixed price con­tract by 0.6 per cent from 15.79 to 15.69 cents per kwh (be­fore GST).</p>
    <p>The re­tailer, which has more than 100,000 cus­tomers, said that this price will ap­ply to its six-month con­tract for cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>On how iSwitch is able to lower prices de­spite fuel cost in­creases, Mr Koscharsky said that the com­pany is able to pass on cost sav­ings to its cus­tomers be­cause it is not bound by the same “ex­pen­sive over­heads that may be tied to a tra­di­tional util­ity”.</p>
