    <p>Iron Man ac­tor Robert Downey Jr has j oined his Avengers co-stars Chris Evans (Cap­tain Amer­ica), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Mark Ruf­falo (Hulk) and Tom Hol­land (Spi­der-Man) in send­ing a mes­sage of en­cour­age­ment to six-year-old Bridger Walker (be­low).</p>
    <p>The boy was mauled and needed 90 stitches in an emer­gency oper­a­tion, after pro­tect­ing his fouryear-old sis­ter from a charg­ing dog.</p>
    <p>Walker, whose fam­ily lives in Wy­oming in the United States, put him­self be­tween a ger­man shep­herd mix and his sis­ter on July 9.</p>
    <p>In true Tony Stark fash­ion, Downey Jr promised to go one up on Evans’ prom­ise of a Cap­tain Amer­ica shield as a gift.</p>
    <p>“Bridger, you’re a rock­star,” Downey Jr said in a video mes­sage shared by the boy’s aunt Ni­cole Walker, who had ear­lier posted about the in­ci­dent on In­sta­gram and tagged sev­eral Avengers stars. Her first post went vi­ral and led to an out­pour­ing of sup­port on­line for Bridger.</p>
    <p>“I hear he’s send­ing a shield your way. I’m go­ing to do one bet­ter. You call me on your next birthday. I got some­thing spe­cial for you. By the way, that’s a prom­ise. A prom­ise beats a shield.”</p>
    <p>There have been many mes­sages of sup­port from around the world for the brave lit­tle boy, who was praised for his self­less act. Other ac­tors who have played su­per­heroes, in­clud­ing Anne Hath­away, who played Cat­woman, and Hugh Jack­man, who played Wolver­ine, have also given him the thumbs-up.</p>
