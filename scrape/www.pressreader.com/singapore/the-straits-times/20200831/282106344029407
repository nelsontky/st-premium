    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker (CB) from April 7 to June 1, the courts heard mat­ters which were es­sen­tial and ur­gent (“E&U”).</p>
    <p>One such cat­e­gory of these cases: those af­fect­ing re­manded ac­cused per­sons.</p>
    <p>Specif­i­cally, the likely length of im­pris­on­ment weighed against the pe­riod of re­mand was con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>If the length of im­pris­on­ment was likely to be shorter than the pe­riod of re­mand if the case was not heard dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, the mat­ter was pri­ori­tised and pro­ceeded for hear­ing dur­ing that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“To en­sure that no re­manded ac­cused per­son was prej­u­diced by any de­lay dur­ing the CB, we would flag rel­e­vant cases to the State Courts as an E&U case to be heard dur­ing the CB,” said a spokesman for the At­tor­neyGen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC).</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a 55-year-old man was charged with un­law­ful over­stay­ing. As he had been in re­mand for one month and six days, the pros­e­cu­tion re­quested his guilty plea be heard dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker to en­sure that the even­tual sen­tence would not be out­stripped by the re­mand pe­riod.</p>
    <p>His plead guilty men­tion was heard on May 21 and the ac­cused was even­tu­ally sen­tenced to six months’ im­pris­on­ment and a fine of $6,000 (in de­fault, six weeks’ im­pris­on­ment).</p>
    <p>Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, the AGC also iden­ti­fied suit­able cases to be brought for­ward and heard ex­pe­di­tiously within the avail­able hear­ing dates in June.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded a case where the ac­cused had been in re­mand for about three months (for of­fences of theft-in­dwelling) and there was a pos­si­bil­ity his even­tual sen­tence might be out­stripped by the time spent in re­mand.</p>
    <p>At the pros­e­cu­tion’s re­quest that the case be heard in June, a two-day trial was sched­uled af­ter which the ac­cused was con­victed on June 24 and sen­tenced to 16 weeks’ jail.</p>
