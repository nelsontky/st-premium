    <p>A 49-year-old man rented 21 prop­er­ties un­der his name on be­half of other in­di­vid­u­als, after they told him that the units would be used to house for­eign stu­dents or work­ers.</p>
    <p>It turned out that 13 of the units were used as broth­els, with one other unit used for gam­bling-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Bernard Que Doh Bing, 49, pleaded guilty yesterday to five charges re­lated to de­ceiv­ing var­i­ous prop­erty own­ers into leas­ing their units to him.</p>
    <p>He was sen­tenced to 45 weeks’ jail and a fine of $10,750.</p>
    <p>Seven other sim­i­lar charges were also taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing by District Judge Marvin Bay.</p>
    <p>The judge noted that Que had con­tin­ued to rent units even after he be­came aware that they were used for pros­ti­tu­tion pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Que en­tered into lease agree­ments for the 21 prop­er­ties be­tween July 2018 and June last year.</p>
    <p>Four of the units, in­clud­ing one in Kim Keat Road, near Wham­poa, were rented on be­half of a man named “Fang Yun” whom he had met in Jo­hor Baru in Fe­bru­ary 2018.</p>
    <p>Fang Yun had told Que then that the prop­er­ties were to be used as res­i­dences for for­eign stu­dents, and that he would be paid about $500 in com­mis­sion a month for each unit he rented.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Que gave the own­ers of each unit a dif­fer­ent rea­son for rent­ing the prop­erty, such as us­ing it as a home of­fice for his “elec­tronic parts” busi­ness or as a place to stay.</p>
    <p>He even asked the own­ers of one unit to pro­vide a bed for his fa­ther, who he claimed would be dis­charged from hos­pi­tal soon and would be stay­ing at the prop­erty with him.</p>
    <p>Que re­ceived about $10,800 in com­mis­sion fees from Fang Yun for rent­ing the four units, which were even­tu­ally found to be used as broth­els.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, he rented the re­main­ing 17 prop­er­ties on be­half of two in­di­vid­u­als who he had claimed were loan sharks he owed money to.</p>
    <p>He had also claimed that the loan sharks told him the units would be used as work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, and that they would deduct a sum from his debt for each unit he rented on their be­half.</p>
    <p>One of the units, lo­cated in a build­ing at Lorong 33 Gey­lang, was even­tu­ally dis­cov­ered to be used for gam­bling-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state de­tails of how Que se­cured the lease for the other prop­er­ties or which ones were also found to be used as broth­els.</p>
    <p>The judge granted Que’s re­quest to de­fer his jail sen­tence – so that he can take care of his fa­ther, who is to un­dergo an op­er­a­tion next month – and or­dered him to sur­ren­der him­self in court on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>For each of his of­fences, Que could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined.</p>
