    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, the first in line to oc­cupy the Oval Of­fice if Pres­i­dent Donald Trump be­comes too ill to carry out his du­ties, has tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 and plans to re­sume cam­paign ap­pear­ances, in­clud­ing at the vice-pres­i­den­tial de­bate on Wed­nes­day night.</p>
    <p>Word of Mr Pence’s plans came on Fri­day, hours after Mr Trump and his wife said that they had tested pos­i­tive for the virus. The Vice-Pres­i­dent’s doc­tor said he had tested neg­a­tive and “is free to go about his nor­mal ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>“Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence does not need to quar­an­tine,” Dr Jesse Schonau, his physi­cian, said. He is “not con­sid­ered a close con­tact with any in­di­vid­u­als who have tested pos­i­tive for Covid, in­clud­ing Pres­i­dent Donald J. Trump”.</p>
    <p>For the rest of Fri­day, Mr Pence filled in for Mr Trump on a con­fer­ence call and pre­pared for his de­bate this week with Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris of Cal­i­for­nia, the Demo­cratic can­di­date for vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence and Ms Har­ris would be placed far­ther apart at their de­bate, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the pro­ce­dure. The Com­mis­sion on Pres­i­den­tial De­bates will seat them 3.7m apart, rather than the ini­tial 2.1m.</p>
    <p>After years of spec­u­la­tion that he might suc­ceed Mr Trump fol­low­ing po­ten­tial im­peach­ment over mat­ters like the Rus­sia in­ves­ti­ga­tion, Mr Pence now finds the prospect of at least tem­po­rar­ily as­sum­ing pres­i­den­tial du­ties more vivid than ever, though White House of­fi­cials said they had no plans to trans­fer power to him even briefly.</p>
    <p>But in the com­ing days, Mr Pence is poised to take on a more prom­i­nent cam­paign role and may rep­re­sent the Pres­i­dent at events at first planned for a healthy Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den on Fri­day headed to the bat­tle­ground state of Michi­gan to re­sume cam­paign­ing after test­ing neg­a­tive for Covid-19. Mr Trump’s Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis is likely to re­in­force Mr Bi­den’s mes­sage about the Pres­i­dent’s failed re­sponse to the dis­ease, which has killed more than 200,000 peo­ple in the United States.</p>
    <p>TAKE VIRUS SE­RI­OUSLY</p>
    <p>This is not a mat­ter of pol­i­tics. It’s a brac­ing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus se­ri­ously. It’s not go­ing away au­to­mat­i­cally. We have to do our part to be re­spon­si­ble.</p>
