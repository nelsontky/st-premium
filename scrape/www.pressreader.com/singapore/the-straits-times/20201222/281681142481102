    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The in­com­ing White House chief of staff has said that Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s re­sponse to the mas­sive hack­ing cam­paign un­cov­ered last week would go beyond sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ron Klain said on Sun­day that Mr Bi­den was map­ping out ways to push back against the sus­pected Rus­sian hack­ers who have pen­e­trated half a dozen US gov­ern­ment agen­cies and left thou­sands of Amer­i­can com­pa­nies ex­posed.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just sanc­tions. It’s steps and things we could do to de­grade the ca­pac­ity of for­eign ac­tors to en­gage in this sort of at­tack,” Mr Klain said on CBS’ Face The Na­tion.</p>
    <p>Op­tions be­ing mulled over by the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to pun­ish Moscow over its al­leged role in­clude fi­nan­cial penal­ties and re­tal­ia­tory hacks on Rus­sian in­fra­struc­ture, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter have told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin de­nies any role in the hack­ing. Speak­ing at an event to com­mem­o­rate the 100th an­niver­sary of Rus­sia’s SVR for­eign in­tel­li­gence agency, Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin praised its work, say­ing he was im­pressed by the “dif­fi­cult pro­fes­sional op­er­a­tions that have been con­ducted”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who be­comes pres­i­dent on Jan 20, is likely to have bi­par­ti­san sup­port for a mus­cu­lar re­ac­tion to the es­pi­onage cam­paign, law­mak­ers in­di­cated on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Mitt Rom­ney said on NBC’s Meet The Press that the data breach was “ex­traor­di­nar­ily dam­ag­ing”.</p>
    <p>“This de­mands a re­sponse,” he said. “This is some­thing we have to ad­dress as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Mark Warner, the top Demo­crat on the Se­nate In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee, said on ABC that the hack could still be go­ing on, and of­fi­cials had yet to de­ter­mine its full scope.</p>
    <p>He backed Mr Rom­ney’s call for re­tal­i­a­tion, say­ing Wash­ing­ton needed to make clear to ad­ver­saries “that if you take this kind of ac­tion, we and oth­ers will strike back”.</p>
    <p>Mr Adam Schiff, the Demo­cratic chair of the House In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee, told MSNBC that, in some cases, the dig­i­tal clean-up of US net­works “may mean burn­ing down the whole sys­tem in order to make sure when we re­build it they’re not present”.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials and cy­ber-se­cu­rity pro­fes­sion­als across the United States are still strug­gling to get their hands around the scale of the hack­ing cam­paign, which used US tech com­pany So­larWinds as a spring­board to in­fect the Texas firm’s clients – in­clud­ing the de­part­ments of Trea­sury, Com­merce and En­ergy.</p>
    <p>Up to 18,000 cus­tomers were left open to the hack­ers, but chief ex­ec­u­tive Kevin Man­dia – whose com­pany FireEye helped un­cover the hack­ing – told CBS he es­ti­mated “only around 50 or­gan­i­sa­tions or com­pa­nies, some­where in that zone”, were “gen­uinely im­pacted”.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has down­played the sever­ity of the cy­ber at­tack on the US gov­ern­ment and sug­gested China may have been re­spon­si­ble – even as other of­fi­cials are con­vinced Rus­sia was the per­pe­tra­tor.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment also re­jected the ac­cu­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“US al­le­ga­tions against China have al­ways been a farce made out of po­lit­i­cal mo­tives in order to smear and den­i­grate China,” For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin said yes­ter­day in Bei­jing. “Such be­hav­iour and words are to­tally in­con­sis­tent with the US’ stand­ing as a ma­jor coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is, mean­while, sud­denly re­viv­ing an old idea: to strip the gen­eral who leads the US Cy­ber Com­mand of his sec­ond ti­tle as the di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Agency, the coun­try’s largest spy op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The idea has been kicked around Wash­ing­ton for years, and the in­tel­li­gence world has hotly de­bated its mer­its. But a de­ci­sion has al­ways been put off be­cause Cy­ber Com­mand, the decade-old or­gan­i­sa­tion that leads the mil­i­tary’s of­fen­sive and de­fen­sive op­er­a­tions around the world, re­mains heav­ily de­pen­dent on in­tel­li­gence pro­vided by the NSA, the 68-year-old code­break­ing agency.</p>
    <p>In na­tional se­cu­rity cir­cles, there is de­bate over whether this is an­other ex­am­ple of Mr Trump’s di­min­ish­ing staff try­ing to push through last­ing changes in their fi­nal 30 days in of­fice, or per­haps ret­ri­bu­tion against Gen­eral Paul M. Naka­sone, the four-star cy­ber chief who holds both posts.</p>
    <p>“The job is just too big for one per­son,” said Mr Dmitri Alper­ovitch, chair­man of Sil­ver­ado Pol­icy Ac­cel­er­a­tor, who fre­quently dealt with both or­gan­i­sa­tions as a founder of CrowdStrik­e, the cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pany.</p>
    <p>But at a mo­ment when in­ves­ti­ga­tors are about to be­gin ex­am­in­ing how the two or­gan­i­sa­tions per­formed in one of the great­est in­tel­li­gence fail­ures in mod­ern times, it hardly seems to be the most ur­gent is­sue.</p>
    <p>Up to 18,000 cus­tomers were left open to the hack­ers, but chief ex­ec­u­tive Kevin Man­dia – whose com­pany FireEye helped un­cover the hack­ing – told CBS he es­ti­mated “only around 50 or­gan­i­sa­tions or com­pa­nies”... were “gen­uinely im­pacted”.</p>
