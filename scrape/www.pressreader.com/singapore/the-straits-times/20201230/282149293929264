    <p>The es­tate of the late Dr Freda Paul, who suf­fered from de­men­tia and was wrongly in­flu­enced by her maid and two for­eign work­ers into giv­ing them al­most $5 mil­lion, has be­queathed $6.75 mil­lion to her alma mater, the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), the in­sti­tu­tion said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The gift from Dr Paul, a re­spected pae­di­a­tri­cian at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal and an as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor of pae­di­atrics at the then Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Fac­ulty of Medicine, was willed in 2007.</p>
    <p>She took an in­ter­est in chil­dren with spe­cial learn­ing needs and had be­queathed much of her es­tate to help needy fe­male med­i­cal stu­dents at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tan Eng Chye, pres­i­dent of NUS, said yes­ter­day: “We are deeply ap­pre­cia­tive of this gen­er­ous gift from the late Dr Freda Paul, which will go a long way towards nur­tur­ing the next gen­er­a­tion of fe­male med­i­cal lead­ers as well as ad­vanc­ing the field of pae­di­atrics.</p>
    <p>“I hope this gift will also in­spire more NUS alumni to im­pact so­ci­ety by sup­port­ing pro­grammes at the univer­sity, ei­ther through life­time gifts or a be­quest as ex­em­pli­fied by the late Dr Paul.”</p>
    <p>The gift will en­able NUS Medicine to set up a bur­sary for fi­nan­cially needy fe­male med­i­cal un­der­grad­u­ates, a pro­fes­sor­ship, as well as a prize that will be awarded to fe­male med­i­cal un­der­grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>It was made pos­si­ble after le­gal ac­tion by her es­tate to re­cover mis­ap­pro­pri­ated funds.</p>
    <p>Dr Paul was sin­gle and her sole as­set was a bun­ga­low in Haig Road, which was sold in 2009 for $15.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>She was suf­fer­ing from de­men­tia, and after having had her will writ­ten, she was be­friended by con­struc­tion worker Ku­landaivelu Malayape­ru­mal and en­gi­neer Gopal Subra­ma­niam, who were work­ing on a site ad­ja­cent to her home.</p>
    <p>To­gether with her maid, Aru­lam­palam Kan­thi­mathy, the duo in­flu­enced Dr Paul into trans­fer­ring to them large sums of money from the pro­ceeds of the sale of her old home and into mak­ing a new will in 2010 that would have be­queathed nearly all of her re­main­ing as­sets to them.</p>
    <p>Some of the sale pro­ceeds were used to pur­chase a smaller home for the el­derly doc­tor.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Dr Paul’s dis­tant rel­a­tives, Mr Philip Je­yaret­nam and Dr Ruhu­nadevi Joshua, were ap­pointed as deputies un­der the Men­tal Ca­pac­ity Act to man­age her af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Dr Paul died in Au­gust 2016 at the age of 87.</p>
    <p>Mr Je­yaret­nam and Dr Joshua suc­cess­fully ap­plied to court for a statu­tory will restor­ing Dr Paul’s ear­lier tes­ta­men­tary in­ten­tions, in­clud­ing her gift to NUS.</p>
    <p>They took pro­ceed­ings on be­half of her es­tate against the three in­di­vid­u­als and ob­tained a judg­ment on May 15, 2017.</p>
    <p>About $4 mil­lion was later re­cov­ered and fur­ther funds were re­alised from the sale of Dr Paul’s smaller home.</p>
    <p>Mr Je­yaret­nam said: “I am de­lighted that Dr Paul’s life and ca­reer will now be hon­oured by this sig­nif­i­cant be­quest to NUS Medicine, as she had wanted.”</p>
    <p>We are deeply ap­pre­cia­tive of this gen­er­ous gift from the late Dr Freda Paul, which will go a long way towards nur­tur­ing the next gen­er­a­tion of fe­male med­i­cal lead­ers as well as ad­vanc­ing the field of pae­di­atrics.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR TAN ENG CHYE, pres­i­dent of NUS.</p>
