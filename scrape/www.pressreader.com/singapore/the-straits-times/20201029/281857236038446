    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jaein has vowed to make his coun­try car­bon-neu­tral by 2050, in line with re­cent pledges by ma­jor economies in­clud­ing China and Ja­pan to fight against cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“To­gether with global com­mu­ni­ties, the gov­ern­ment will ac­tively tackle cli­mate change, and move to­wards the goal of car­bon neu­tral­ity by 2050,” he said dur­ing a bud­get speech yes­ter­day. “Tran­si­tion­ing from coal to re­new­able en­ergy, the gov­ern­ment will cre­ate new mar­kets, in­dus­tries and jobs.”</p>
    <p>Al­ready adopted by the Euro­pean Union, the 2050 goal was first raised in South Korea in March this year as part of the rul­ing Demo­cratic Party’s (DP) green man­i­festo ahead of elec­tions, which the party won in a land­slide.</p>
    <p>While Mr Moon an­nounced a Green New Deal in July to in­vest 114 tril­lion won (S$137 bil­lion) in green jobs, re­new­able en­ergy, elec­tric cars and en­ergy-sav­ing build­ings, as part of a post-pan­demic eco­nomic re­cov­ery pack­age, he stopped short of back­ing net-zero emis­sions.</p>
    <p>His endorsemen­t fi­nally came two days af­ter Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga pledged to cut car­bon emis­sions to net-zero by 2050, and a month af­ter Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping set a 2060 tar­get for car­bon neu­tral­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon’s dec­la­ra­tion, made amid mount­ing pres­sure on South Korea to stop in­vest­ing in coal power plants over­seas, was wel­comed by en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists, cli­mate-con­scious in­vestor groups and the United Na­tions.</p>
    <p>South Korea, the world’s sev­enth-big­gest car­bon emit­ter ac­cord­ing to the World Bank, has long been la­belled a cli­mate vil­lain for be­ing the third-largest coal fi­nancier, af­ter China and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>State-owned Korea Elec­tric Power Cor­po­ra­tion and con­glom­er­ate Sam­sung’s con­struc­tion arm Sam­sung C&T were heav­ily crit­i­cised ear­lier this month for in­vest­ing in the Vung Ang 2 coal power plant in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim Joo-jin, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of non-gov­ern­men­tal group So­lu­tions for Our Cli­mate, said South Korea is “fi­nally one step closer to align­ing it­self with the re­duc­tion path­way com­pat­i­ble with Paris Agree­ment goals”.</p>
    <p>But he pointed out that there is “much to be done to make this dec­la­ra­tion ac­tu­ally mean­ing­ful”, such as en­hanc­ing South Korea’s 2030 emis­sions re­duc­tion tar­get, mak­ing a clear road map to phase out coal by 2030, and end­ing coal fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Fun­da­men­tal changes in en­ergy pol­icy are also re­quired, such as re­vi­sion of land and mar­itime re­stric­tions and ma­jor re­forms in the out­dated power mar­ket to in­crease so­lar and wind power, added Mr Kim.</p>
    <p>DP law­maker Lee So-young, an en­vi­ron­men­tal­ist who drafted the party’s green man­i­festo, said the Na­tional Assem­bly will work to­wards de­vel­op­ing the nec­es­sary laws and poli­cies to “fa­cil­i­tate this huge so­ci­etal tran­si­tion” to car­bon neu­tral­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephane Du­jar­ric, spokesman for UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res, said they are look­ing for­ward to con­crete pol­icy mea­sures by South Korea to re­alise its 2050 goal.</p>
    <p>South Korea now has 60 coal plants gen­er­at­ing about 40 per cent of its elec­tric­ity. Four have been shut down, and six more will be closed by 2022, as the power grid shifts to­wards re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>By 2034, South Korea should have only 30 coal plants left.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon’s 2050 tar­get will be wel­comed by in­vestors who in­creas­ingly want to de­ploy funds into mar­kets that are re­duc­ing cli­mate risk, said Ms Re­becca Mikula-Wright, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Asia In­vestor Group on Cli­mate Change.</p>
    <p>“The three largest economies in East Asia now have clear com­mit­ments to net zero emis­sions by or near mid-cen­tury,” she said. “This is a pow­er­ful mar­ket sig­nal that should help en­cour­age other Asian na­tions to fol­low suit and send a strong mes­sage to car­bon-in­ten­sive trade part­ners fur­ther afield that the re­gion is mov­ing to de­car­bonise.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Sam­sung C&T has an­nounced a coal exit plan.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing projects, like Vung Ang 2 in Viet­nam, will be “grad­u­ally with­drawn from de­pend­ing on their con­tract sta­tus”, it said.</p>
