    <p>When Okorn-Kuo Jing Hong be­gan di­rect­ing a cast with dis­abil­i­ties in the the­atre show What If, she wanted the work to re­spect the per­form­ers’ dis­abil­i­ties with­out try­ing to cover them up.</p>
    <p>Ac­tors who can­not see could ori­en­tate them­selves by feel­ing mark­ings on the stage, or the lights could be rigged in such a way that they could feel their heat. A wheel­chair could be­come part of a set, even a pro­jec­tion screen, al­beit a small one.</p>
    <p>“How can we not hide those things but trans­form them, make them part of the aes­thetic?” says Okorn-Kuo, 49. “I want to work with this cast with­out ne­gat­ing or dis­re­spect­ing the re­al­i­ties they’re fac­ing in daily life.”</p>
    <p>Then along came the Covid-19 pan­demic and all their plans had to be thrown out of the win­dow.</p>
    <p>Now they had to work out how to re­motely guide a blind ac­tor in set­ting up a cam­era and fram­ing a shot, or how an ac­tor with cere­bral palsy could do warm-up ex­er­cises with­out the help of an ac­cess worker dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“We had cre­ated this work in a phys­i­cal space, where we were in­her­ently con­nected by just be­ing present,” says Okorn-Kuo. “Sud­denly, we had to re­de­fine con­nec­tion.”</p>
    <p>What If is a com­mis­sion for the an­nual M1 Peer Plea­sure Youth The­atre Fes­ti­val, which men­tors youth aged 13 to 25 in the­atremak­ing.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val runs from to­day to Aug 16 and is pro­duced by Art­sWok Col­lab­o­ra­tive, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with Es­planade – The­atres on the Bay. This year’s fes­ti­val theme is dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Artis­tic di­rec­tor Jean Ng, 51, who has worked for al­most 20 years with chil­dren and adults with Down syn­drome and autism, says: “It is im­por­tant for me to ex­pose young peo­ple to and ed­u­cate them about so­cial is­sues and peo­ple who fall through the cracks in our ‘suc­cess story’, to ask ques­tions and think about how they can act to make pos­i­tive changes.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “I have been mak­ing the­atre for over 30 years and be­lieve that the arts are es­sen­tial for hu­man life. How is it then that I have never se­ri­ously thought about the fact that my work is not ac­ces­si­ble to per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties? Is it less es­sen­tial for them? Or are they less hu­man? I hope more peo­ple mak­ing artis­tic works can think about this.”</p>
    <p>What If com­prises four works that will be per­formed over Zoom on dif­fer­ent days, from Frozen. Bro­ken. Poof!, in which five friends try to cel­e­brate a birth­day vir­tu­ally; to Fetch­ing Sanc­tu­ary, an ex­change be­tween a blind per­son and a sound artist in the time of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally don’t like Zoom re­hearsals,” says ac­tor Shawn Tan, who has Down syn­drome, over e-mail. “It is dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand one an­other and I don’t get to in­ter­act with oth­ers as much.”</p>
    <p>Tan, 22, is the cre­ator and nar­ra­tor of short an­i­ma­tion What If Aliens, which ac­com­pa­nies each of the shows. In Frozen. Bro­ken. Poof!, he teaches the other per­form­ers to dance K-pop. “They all did a good job and it was very fun to watch ev­ery­one, i nclud­ing Jing Hong, dance to­gether.”</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val line-up also in­cludes Riley’s Rain, a sen­sory-friendly YouTube per­for­mance for chil­dren on the autism spec­trum; and two staged read­ings by stu­dents, If Th­ese Wheels Could Speak by Tan­jong Ka­tong Girls’ School and The Other Peo­ple by Dun­man High School.</p>
    <p>If Th­ese Wheels Could Speak di­rec­tor Nur Sahirrah Safit, 32, says the team in­ter­viewed peo­ple with cere­bral palsy to cre­ate the story of Natasha, 15 and an as­pir­ing poet who uses a wheel­chair.</p>
    <p>“As much as their dis­abil­ity is a part of them, it does not de­fine who they are as a per­son,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing a phys­i­cal dis­abil­ity does not equate to hav­ing an in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity. We would also like to dis­miss the no­tion that peo­ple with cere­bral palsy have lower IQ.”</p>
    <p>It will be the last edi­tion of the fes­ti­val, as spon­sor M1 is pulling out from next year.</p>
    <p>“The news was ini­tially dis­ap­point­ing, of course,” says pro­ducer Ngiam Su-Lin, 46.</p>
    <p>But she adds that this has been an op­por­tu­nity to stop and con­sider other ways to con­nect with young peo­ple, and that the dig­i­tal realm has opened more pos­si­bil­i­ties – though face-to-face en­gage­ment re­mains ir­re­place­able.</p>
    <p>“Our com­mit­ment to work­ing with young peo­ple will con­tinue. They en­er­gise us and we learn a lot col­lab­o­rat­ing with them and so it is with feel­ings of hope that we con­tinue on our jour­ney.”</p>
