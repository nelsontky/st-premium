    <p>LONDON • Bri­tain will ban “buy one get one free” pro­mo­tions for food high in fat, su­gar or salt, and free re­fills of sug­ary soft drinks in restau­rants from April 2022, the gov­ern­ment said yes­ter­day, its lat­est step in its plan to tackle obe­sity and im­prove pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment says obe­sity is one of Bri­tain’s big­gest long-term pub­lic health prob­lems with al­most two-thirds of adults in Eng­land over­weight and one in three chil­dren leav­ing pri­mary school over­weight or obese.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures will also re­strict where in a store pro­mo­tions on such prod­ucts can be ad­ver­tised, and un­healthy pro­mo­tions will not be al­lowed at check­outs, shop en­trances or at the ends of aisles.</p>
    <p>“We are re­strict­ing pro­mo­tions and in­tro­duc­ing a range of mea­sures to make sure the healthy choice is the easy choice. Cre­at­ing an en­vi­ron­ment which helps ev­ery­one eat health­ier foods more reg­u­larly is cru­cial to im­prov­ing the health of the na­tion,” pub­lic health min­is­ter Jo Churchill said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain first pro­posed re­strict­ing “buy one get one free” deals on junk food in July, and also an­nounced mea­sures such as ban­ning TV and on­line ad­ver­tise­ments for junk food be­fore 9pm.</p>
    <p>Last month, the gov­ern­ment went fur­ther and pro­posed a to­tal ban on on­line ad­ver­tis­ing of un­healthy food.</p>
    <p>Be­ing over­weight has been shown to in­crease the risk of se­ri­ous ill­ness or death from Covid-19 – a fact high­lighted by Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son who has pub­licly talked about his own need to lose weight since be­ing hos­pi­talised with the dis­ease.</p>
