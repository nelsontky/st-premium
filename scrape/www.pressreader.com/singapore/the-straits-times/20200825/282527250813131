    <p>In the two years af­ter his dis­ap­pear­ance, the fam­ily of kid­napped stu­dent ac­tivist Biru Laut con­tinue to lay his place at the ta­ble every Sun­day. They play the record of his favourite song, Black­bird by The Bea­tles, and wait for him to come home.</p>
    <p>Laut may be the fic­tional pro­tag­o­nist of In­done­sian writer Leila S. Chu­dori’s novel The Sea Speaks His Name, but what his fam­ily goes through is based on the real-life ac­counts of those whose chil­dren van­ished into po­lit­i­cal de­ten­tion in the 1990s, dur­ing the last days of Pres­i­dent Suharto’s regime.</p>
    <p>Chu­dori, 57, won the South-east Asia Write Award for this novel, which was pub­lished in 2017 in In­done­sian as Laut Bercerita.</p>
    <p>It was brought out lo­cally ear­lier this year by Pen­guin Ran­dom House South-east Asia in an English trans­la­tion by John H. McG­lynn.</p>
    <p>“I’m very hon­oured,” says Chu­dori of re­ceiv­ing the re­gional award, which has been pre­sented an­nu­ally since 1979 to lead­ing po­ets and writ­ers in the 10 Asean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Chu­dori, the daugh­ter of The Jakarta Post co-founder Muham­mad Chu­dori, spent 28 years as a jour­nal­ist at news mag­a­zine Tempo.</p>
    <p>In 2008, the mag­a­zine was work­ing on a spe­cial edi­tion on the Suharto regime. Chu­dori asked jour­nal­ist Nezar Pa­tria, a sur­vivor of the 1998 stu­dent ab­duc­tions, to write an ac­count of his own kid­nap­ping, de­ten­tion and tor­ture at the hands of the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“He wrote the piece and it was beau­ti­ful,” says Chu­dori over Skype from Jakarta. “It was re­ally scary and touch­ing and a lot of peo­ple just couldn’t be­lieve that that hap­pened only so many years ago.</p>
    <p>“I said to Nezar, ‘Look, I want to write about this.’ And he said, ‘Yes, you should write it be­cause I’m not sure that in 10 or 20 years, the govern­ment will ever find out what hap­pened.’ It was never clear, you know, what re­ally hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>Of the 23 ac­tivists who were kid­napped, only nine were re­leased. One was found dead and the rest were never heard from again.</p>
    <p>Chu­dori, who worked full-time as a jour­nal­ist un­til her re­tire­ment in 2017, would spend her week­ends do­ing re­search for The Sea Speaks His Name.</p>
    <p>She in­ter­viewed sur­vivors as well as the par­ents and sib­lings of those who had dis­ap­peared, many of whom con­tinue to press the govern­ment for an­swers.</p>
    <p>“It is re­ally painful,” she says, “be­cause one by one, the par­ents have be­gun to pass away, not know­ing what hap­pened to their chil­dren, not able to bury them.”</p>
    <p>There were par­ents who would stand in front of the state palace every Thurs­day, ask­ing what had hap­pened to their child. One fa­ther did not want to close the door of his house in case his son came back.</p>
    <p>She gave her pro­tag­o­nist the po­etic name of Biru Laut, or “blue sea” in Ba­hasa In­done­sia, partly be­cause of the ru­mour that the miss­ing stu­dents were at the bot­tom of the ocean.</p>
    <p>The novel opens with Laut be­ing ex­e­cuted and thrown into the sea. It then flashes back and forth through his life, from his child­hood to how he came to join the stu­dent ac­tivists and his sub­se­quent kid­nap­ping and tor­ture.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond part is told from the per­spec­tive of his younger sis­ter As­mara Jati, who, years later, con­tin­ues to search for her brother.</p>
    <p>The novel was adapted into a 30-minute short film by di­rec­tor Pritagita Ari­ane­gara in 2018.</p>
    <p>Chu­dori started writ­ing as a child and got her first work – a short story about a ba­nana tree – pub­lished in a mag­a­zine at the age of 12.</p>
    <p>She and cu­ra­tor Yudhi So­er­joat­modjo have a daugh­ter, Rain Chu­dori-So­er­joat­modjo, 25.</p>
    <p>She has fol­lowed in her mother’s foot­steps as a writer and had her first story pub­lished in The Jakarta Post when she was 14.</p>
    <p>Chu­dori’s own early sto­ries tended to be about women or psy­cho­log­i­cal fam­ily drama, but her work as a jour­nal­ist shifted the fo­cus of her fic­tion to­wards the po­lit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>Her 2012 novel Pu­lang, later trans­lated into English as Home, was about In­done­sian po­lit­i­cal ex­iles forced abroad dur­ing the 1965 an­ti­com­mu­nist purge, un­able to re­turn home for the rest of their lives.</p>
    <p>She is now work­ing on a se­quel to Pu­lang, al­though given the de­press­ing at­mos­phere of the Covid-19 pan­demic, she has found her­self jug­gling that with an “up­lift­ing an­thol­ogy of culi­nary sto­ries”.</p>
    <p>“As a jour­nal­ist, you write facts,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Whereas in fic­tion, you start ev­ery­thing with a char­ac­ter, and then you build your char­ac­ter based on your imag­i­na­tion and your re­search. A lot of things that I couldn’t write in jour­nal­ism, I could write in my fic­tion.”</p>
    <p>It is re­ally painful be­cause one by one, the par­ents have be­gun to pass away, not know­ing what hap­pened to their chil­dren, not able to bury them.</p>
