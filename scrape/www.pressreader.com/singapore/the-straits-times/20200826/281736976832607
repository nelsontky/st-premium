    <p>Sin­ga­pore-regis­tered Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group said the post­ing of con­tro­ver­sial mar­ket­ing ma­te­rial “ap­pears to be the re­sult of the ac­tions of cer­tain er­rant in­di­vid­u­als, pos­si­bly with ma­li­cious in­tent”.</p>
    <p>It added that it will be ap­point­ing in­de­pen­dent le­gal coun­sel to in­ves­ti­gate the con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>The BN Group made the news re­cently for its re­ported £280 mil­lion (S$503 mil­lion) takeover bid for New­cas­tle United Foot­ball Club.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing this, the group came un­der scru­tiny and, last week­end, ad­mit­ted that some pub­lic­ity pho­tos that fea­tured its co-founders with for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama had been al­tered.</p>
    <p>The group’s chief mar­ket­ing and in­vestor re­la­tions of­fi­cer Nerei­des An­to­nio Gi­a­mundo de Bour­bon ad­mit­ted to Reuters that it had doc­tored pho­tos of Mr Obama to make them look as if he had at­tended a meet­ing with its ex­ec­u­tives in Paris.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, the pho­tos were taken last De­cem­ber at a char­ity gala event in Sin­ga­pore spon­sored by Novena Global Life­care, which was founded by Sin­ga­pore busi­ness­men Ter­ence Loh, 42, and Nel­son Loh, 40.</p>
    <p>Other dis­crep­an­cies were also spot­ted in their pub­lic­ity ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>The two men, who are cousins, are co-founders of the BN Group, to­gether with Chi­nese busi­ness­woman Evan­ge­line Shen, 32.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last night, the BN Group said that the bid to ac­quire the English Premier League club had “led to a num­ber of queries re­lat­ing to the com­pany and mar­ket­ing ma­te­rial that was pur­port­edly re­leased by the com­pany”.</p>
    <p>It as­serted that the mar­ket­ing ma­te­rial also in­cludes “mat­ters in the pipe­line but which have not been con­cluded”.</p>
    <p>It added that it will not ad­dress any fur­ther me­dia queries un­til in­ves­ti­ga­tions have been com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The BN Group was formed fol­low­ing a merger between the Loh cousins’ in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle, the Dorr Group, and Ms Shen’s Bel­la­graph Group.</p>
    <p>It was set up on July 20 with a paid-up cap­i­tal of $20 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Among other things, it claimed to own more than 30 en­ti­ties across 100 coun­tries in ma­jor fields in­clud­ing fi­nance, sports, health­care, lux­ury goods, en­ter­tain­ment and ro­bot­ics.</p>
    <p>It said it is based in Paris and worth an es­ti­mated US$12 bil­lion (S$16 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Be­sides the doc­tored pho­tos, other in­con­sis­ten­cies that sur­faced in the group’s pub­lic­ity ma­te­rial and so­cial me­dia posts in­clude a state­ment that it op­er­ates more than 10,000 pri­vate jets.</p>
    <p>When pressed about the Reuters re­port last Saturday, Mr de Bour­bon told The Sun­day Times in an e-mail – which was copied to the co­founders and their lawyers – that the re­port was “fac­tu­ally un­real”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he did not re­spond specif­i­cally to ST’s queries about the group’s rev­enue streams, its 23,000 em­ploy­ees, and its ad­dresses in Sin­ga­pore and Paris.</p>
    <p>Reuters had re­ported that no com­pany named Bel­la­graph Nova Group is regis­tered in France.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic­ity ma­te­rial for the BN Group also de­scribes the Dorr Group as hav­ing over US$4 bil­lion in as­sets.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen’s Bel­la­graph Group in­cludes Bel­la­graph Jew­elry, and a press state­ment in June said it is “most no­tably famed for hold­ing the world record for high­est ever on­line sin­gle sale trans­ac­tion of US$102 mil­lion (across all prod­uct cat­e­gories glob­ally)”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, the group re­tracted sev­eral press re­leases re­lated to its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>These had been dis­trib­uted by PR Newswire in the past two months.</p>
    <p>One of them, is­sued on July 10, was ti­tled “Wel­come To NETX – global con­glom­er­ate Bel­la­graph Nova Group launches lat­est tech­nolgy (sic) plat­form fo­cus­ing on AI + ro­bot­ics + health­care”.</p>
    <p>It said then that NETX “was born” as a re­sult of a “his­toric” closed-door meet­ing that its co-founders had with Mr Obama last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>An­other one, ti­tled “The new so­cial tech­nol­ogy rev­o­lu­tion – panel dis­cus­sion with Bel­la­graph Nova Group founders and Barack Obama on their am­bi­tious quest to seize the op­por­tu­nity of a life­time in the post pan­demic world”, is­sued on July 13, was also re­tracted.</p>
    <p>This re­lease said that “through one of the BN Group’s en­ti­ties, Bel­la­graph Jew­elry’s client re­la­tion­ship man­age­ment, the King of Saudi Ara­bia, the King of Qatar, and Queen Mother of Qatar have ex­pressed their in­ter­est on in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties and col­lab­o­ra­tions”.</p>
    <p>It added: “Through our ex­ten­sive work with the Obama Foun­da­tion char­i­ta­ble ini­tia­tives as well as on­go­ing ef­fort to pro­mote hu­man rights, we have at­tracted sev­eral global com­pa­nies such as the likes of Citibank, JP Mor­gan, and other es­tab­lished Global For­tune 500 com­pa­nies to part­ner with the BN Group.”</p>
    <p>A third, on an un­re­lated topic, ti­tled “Bel­la­graph Jew­elry launches world’s first male lux­ury jew­ellery line tai­lored for power”, is­sued on Aug 10, was sim­i­larly with­drawn.</p>
    <p>In that re­lease, BN Group claimed that Mr Obama “was seen per­son­ally don­ning one among Bel­la­graph Jew­ellery’s unique sig­na­ture ‘La Rose’ Lapel items that’s set in un­com­mon coloured gem stones”.</p>
    <p>BN Group said in a note pub­lished on PR Newswire that jour­nal­ists and other read­ers “should dis­re­gard” those re­leases.</p>
