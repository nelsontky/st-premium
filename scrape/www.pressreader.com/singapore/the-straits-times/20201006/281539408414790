    <p>Re­tail sales con­tin­ued their re­bound in Au­gust, al­though the sharp jump in sales seen in July has pe­tered out. Tak­ings at the till de­clined 5.7 per cent com­pared with Au­gust last year but bet­ter than the year-on-year drop of</p>
    <p>8.5 per cent in July.</p>
    <p>Around 7.6 mil­lion free re­us­able an­timi­cro­bial masks were col­lected by res­i­dents in Te­masek Foun­da­tion’s sec­ond na­tion­wide dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>The Te­masek ini­tia­tive was the fourth such ex­er­cise na­tion­wide to help pro­tect res­i­dents against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Some 3.8 mil­lion res­i­dents col­lected free mask kits in the lat­est two-week ex­er­cise held from Sept 21 to Sun­day. The col­lec­tion process was fa­cil­i­tated by vol­un­teers, in­clud­ing from the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, who helped peo­ple un­fa­mil­iar with the process.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Foun­da­tion dis­trib­uted 9.3 mil­lion masks in its first ex­er­cise from June to July. These in­cluded 300,000 mask kits that were de­liv­ered to mi­grant work­ers who could not leave their dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“Some of the dif­fer­ence in num­bers is ex­plained by a dif­fer­ent dis­tri­bu­tion mech­a­nism used to reach mi­grant work­ers. In this round, that dis­tri­bu­tion is on­go­ing,” said a Te­masek Foun­da­tion spokesman.</p>
    <p>The so­cial and char­ity arm of Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment firm Te­masek also dis­closed that it re­ceived about 214,000 pre-or­ders for mask kits, with some colours more pop­u­lar than oth­ers. This is four times higher than in the pre­vi­ous round.</p>
    <p>The mask dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise has ended and will not be ex­tended, but Te­masek Foun­da­tion is look­ing to con­duct fur­ther dis­tri­bu­tions in the fu­ture, the spokesman added.</p>
