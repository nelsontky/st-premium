    <p>LONDON • Bri­tain’s econ­omy grew much more slowly than ex­pected in Au­gust, set­ting back its re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus lock­down, with much of what growth there was down to a one-off gov­ern­ment restau­rant sub­sidy pro­gramme, of­fi­cial data showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct rose by 2.1 per cent from July, its slow­est month-on-month in­crease since the econ­omy be­gan its re­cov­ery in May af­ter a record slump, and not even half the me­dian forecast of 4.6 per cent in a Reuters poll of economists.</p>
    <p>“While the lat­est data con­firms a re­bound in eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity con­tin­ued into Au­gust, the sharp slow­down in growth in­di­cates that the re­cov­ery may be run­ning out of steam, with out­put still well be­low pre-cri­sis lev­els,” said Mr Suren Thiru, head of eco­nom­ics at the Bri­tish Cham­bers of Com­merce.</p>
    <p>“The in­crease in ac­tiv­ity in Au­gust largely re­flects a tem­po­rary boost from the econ­omy re­open­ing and gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus, in­clud­ing the Eat Out To Help Out scheme, rather than proof of a sus­tained Vshaped re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>More than half of the eco­nomic growth in Au­gust came from the ac­com­mo­da­tion and food sec­tor, where out­put surged by 71.4 per cent, boosted by the Eat Out To Help Out scheme to sub­sidise meals and eas­ing lock­down re­stric­tions, the Of­fice for Na­tional Statis­tics (ONS) said.</p>
    <p>The pound weak­ened against the US dol­lar and the euro af­ter the data was re­leased.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy – which shrank more than that of any other Group of Seven na­tion in the April-to-June pe­riod – re­mained 9.2 per cent be­low its level just be­fore the pan­demic hit Bri­tain, the ONS said. “The econ­omy con­tin­ued to re­cover in Au­gust but by less than in re­cent months,” said ONS deputy na­tional statis­ti­cian for eco­nomic statis­tics Jonathan Athow.</p>
    <p>The dom­i­nant ser­vice sec­tor grew by 2.4 per cent from July, a lot slower than ex­pec­ta­tions for growth of 5 per cent. Growth in the smaller man­u­fac­tur­ing and con­struc­tion sec­tors also fell short of fore­casts.</p>
    <p>Economists have warned that the Bri­tish econ­omy may strug­gle to grow in the months ahead as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases be­gan to rise last month and the gov­ern­ment re­sponded by tight­en­ing its re­stric­tions on peo­ple gath­er­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>Bank of Eng­land (BOE) gov­er­nor An­drew Bai­ley said on Thurs­day that risks to the econ­omy were “very much on the down­side” and the cen­tral bank was ready to use its pol­icy fire­power to limit the im­pact of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions. The BOE is ex­pected to in­crease its bond-buy­ing pro­gramme next month to pump more stim­u­lus into the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is also fac­ing the risk of fail­ing to se­cure a trade deal with the Euro­pean Union, with ne­go­ti­a­tions still on­go­ing ahead of the Dec 31 ex­piry of the coun­try’s post-Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod.</p>
