    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain be­came the first coun­try in western Europe to re­port more than three mil­lion coro­n­avirus cases, as it grap­ples with a new strain that is putting pres­sure on its health ser­vice.</p>
    <p>It re­ported an ad­di­tional 59,937 cases last Satur­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 3,017,409. That is the most in Europe, and fifth-high­est in the world, ac­cord­ing to data from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The coun­try passed one mil­lion cases on Oct 31, which dou­bled seven weeks later on Dec 19. It took just three weeks to reach three mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther 1,035 peo­ple were re­ported to have died within 28 days of a pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus test, bring­ing the to­tal to more than 80,800, also the most in Europe.</p>
    <p>The new strain of the coro­n­avirus has led to a surge in new cases, forc­ing the gov­ern­ment to place the coun­try un­der a third na­tional lock­down, clos­ing schools and non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Lon­don Mayor Sadiq Khan de­clared a “ma­jor in­ci­dent” in the cap­i­tal last Fri­day as he warned that the state-run Na­tional Health Ser­vice (NHS) was at risk of be­ing over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock also warned that the surge in cases has left the NHS in a “very, very se­ri­ous sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>“The pres­sure on the NHS is very, very bad and we need to bring the case rate right down,” he told Sky</p>
    <p>News. “These rules are not there as bound­aries to be pushed, they are the limit of what peo­ple should be do­ing.”</p>
    <p>He said about two mil­lion of Bri­tain’s pop­u­la­tion have been vac­ci­nated so far. Around 200,000 were cur­rently be­ing vac­ci­nated ev­ery day, in­clud­ing one-third of the over-80s re­garded as the most vul­ner­a­ble group to the disease as Bri­tain is on course to meet­ing the tar­get and of­fer­ing an op­por­tu­nity to start eas­ing re­stric­tions in the spring. Mass vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres are set to open this week to ac­cel­er­ate the roll-out.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has promised to in­oc­u­late 15 mil­lion el­derly and vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple by the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>Queen El­iz­a­beth II and her hus­band, the Duke of Ed­in­burgh, both in their 90s, re­ceived the first dose of Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions at Wind­sor Cas­tle, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from Buck­ing­ham Palace is­sued last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said yes­ter­day that it has helped raise US$1 bil­lion (S$1.33 bil­lion) to­wards a drive to help “vul­ner­a­ble coun­tries” ac­cess coro­n­avirus vac­cines, by match­fund­ing con­tri­bu­tions. It said it has also com­mit­ted £548 mil­lion (S$986 mil­lion) to the Co­vax Ad­vance Mar­ket Com­mit­ment (AMC), after match­ing with £1 ev­ery US$4 pledged by other donors. Canada, Ja­pan and Ger­many are among the coun­tries to make con­tri­bu­tions that it matched, help­ing the AMC raise more than US$1.7 bil­lion in to­tal so far.</p>
    <p>The fund will al­low for the dis­tri­bu­tion of one bil­lion Covid-19 vac­cine doses to 92 de­vel­op­ing coun­tries this year, ac­cord­ing to Bri­tain’s For­eign Of­fice.</p>
    <p>“We’ll only be safe from this virus when we’re all safe – which is why we’re fo­cused on a global so­lu­tion to a global prob­lem,” For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came as Bri­tain marks the 75th an­niver­sary of the first meet­ing of the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly in Lon­don, host­ing UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res for a so-called vir­tual visit set to begin yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He will meet Mr Raab and Mr John­son, as well as Mr Alok Sharma, who last week was des­ig­nated full-time pres­i­dent of the UN’s next ma­jor cli­mate sum­mit, COP26, in Novem­ber. Mr Sharma had pre­vi­ously done the role part­time along­side his Bri­tish gov­ern­ment job of sec­re­tary of state for busi­ness, en­ergy and in­dus­trial strat­egy, which he left last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the vir­tual visit, Mr Guter­res said he was hon­oured to “re­new our cause of over­com­ing global chal­lenges to­gether, and cel­e­brate a coun­try that was in­stru­men­tal in cre­at­ing the United Na­tions”.</p>
