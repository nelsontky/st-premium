    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board says it is stan­dard prac­tice to de­stroy all con­fis­cated wildlife parts and prod­ucts, while the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency says il­le­gally im­ported food prod­ucts are also de­stroyed, as they can pose a food safety risk. The Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force, how­ever, some­times auc­tions off suit­able seized case ex­hibits.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has said it is com­mit­ted to a zero-tol­er­ance pol­icy when it comes to il­le­gal wildlife traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>In a move that was praised by en­vi­ron­men­tal groups, the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) crushed and in­cin­er­ated close to 9 tonnes of con­fis­cated il­le­gal ivory from Aug 11 to Aug 13.</p>
    <p>Ivory, how­ever, is just one of sev­eral il­le­gal items that are seized and de­stroyed by Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Snake wines, hard corals and marine tur­tle eggs are also seized by NParks, while the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) takes care of il­le­gally im­ported veg­eta­bles and fruits.</p>
    <p>NParks has in the past con­fis­cated a taxi­der­mised gila mon­ster – a species of ven­omous lizard – and a nau­tilus shell.</p>
    <p>Last year, the board seized 638 wildlife parts and prod­ucts, 37.5 tonnes of pan­golin scales and close to 9 tonnes of ivory and ivory prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>NParks said it is stan­dard prac­tice to de­stroy all con­fis­cated wildlife parts and prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>It added that de­struc­tion of th­ese items pre­vents the prod­ucts from re-en­ter­ing the mar­ket, al­though “a few are kept for ed­u­ca­tional pur­poses” and dis­played in outreach pro­grammes in schools or dur­ing learn­ing jour­neys with youth groups.</p>
    <p>The highly pub­li­cised de­struc­tion of ivory was praised by Ms An­barasi Boopal, deputy ex­ec­u­tive of wildlife res­cue group An­i­mal Con­cerns Re­search and Ed­u­ca­tion So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“(It shows) a stronger com­mit­ment to tack­ling the is­sue of wildlife trade and is in line with the soon to come into force ban in do­mes­tic trade in ivory,” she said.</p>
    <p>NParks also noted that it works with var­i­ous part­ners, such as Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore, to care for smug­gled live wild an­i­mals and an­a­lyse seized items to iden­tify their ori­gin.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, il­le­gally im­ported food prod­ucts are de­stroyed, as they are “of un­known sources and can pose a food safety risk”, said the SFA, which dealt with 126 cases of il­le­gal food im­ports last year.</p>
    <p>While it might seem like a waste, the agency pointed out that such un­known prod­ucts could have ad­verse health ef­fects.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, one could in­gest ex­ces­sive pes­ti­cide residue from veg­eta­bles that have been treated with high level of pes­ti­cides.</p>
    <p>But cer­tain con­fis­cated items are not des­tined for dis­posal.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force flogs off suit­able seized case ex­hibits – that the courts have or­dered to be sur­ren­dered to the state – in po­lice auc­tions that are held twice or thrice a year, said the po­lice in re­sponse to queries.</p>
    <p>Also of­fered at th­ese auc­tions are un­claimed items from the force’s found and un­claimed prop­erty of­fice, and po­lice as­sets that have been con­demned.</p>
    <p>The auc­tions often at­tract bar­gain hun­ters who come for the watches, jew­ellery, cam­eras or even e-scoot­ers and sports cars that are on of­fer.</p>
    <p>In the March auc­tion this year, items of­fered in­cluded Cartier bracelets, Omega watches, Chanel ear­rings and a Mercedes-Benz car.</p>
    <p>Last year, a used Lam­borgh­ini Mur­cielago LP670-4 Su­per­ve­loce fetched $246,000 at a po­lice auc­tion, far below its then open mar­ket value av­er­age of $491,000.</p>
    <p>Bar­gain hunter Spring Sun, 41, a mul­ti­me­dia de­signer, said such good deals can often be found in auc­tions.</p>
    <p>It does not bother her that the items there have been used by other peo­ple or might even be the pro­ceeds of crime, she added.</p>
    <p>“If you think about it, plenty of things out there have been used by some­one else,” she said.</p>
