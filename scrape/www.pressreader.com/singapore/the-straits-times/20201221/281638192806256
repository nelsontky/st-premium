    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Kin­der­garten Im­pact Project (Skip) is Sin­ga­pore’s first large-scale lon­gi­tu­di­nal study of pre-school chil­dren.</p>
    <p>It fol­lowed a co­hort of 1,537 chil­dren from 80 pre-schools (childcare cen­tres, an­chor op­er­a­tor and non-an­chor op­er­a­tor kinder­gartens and Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion kinder­gartens) as they pro­gressed from Kin­der­garten 1 in 2015 to Pri­mary 1 in 2017.</p>
    <p>As part of the study, the re­search team – com­pris­ing Dr Ng Ee Lynn, Dr Beth O’Brien, Dr Nir­mala Karup­piah, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ken­neth Poon and Dr Fan­nie Khng – con­ducted pri­mary data col­lec­tion and com­pleted the anal­y­sis in July this year.</p>
    <p>The aim of Skip was to un­der­stand how fac­tors re­lated to the school, home, and child in­ter­act to in­flu­ence chil­dren’s de­vel­op­ment and fu­ture learn­ing.</p>
    <p>It also aimed to iden­tify how these fac­tors con­trib­uted to the suc­cess­ful de­vel­op­ment of English and mother tongue lan­guage and lit­er­acy skills.</p>
    <p>• The Skip team used a va­ri­ety of data col­lec­tion meth­ods which in­cluded one-on-one child as­sess­ments, and par­ent and teacher sur­veys.</p>
    <p>The team also used tools to as­sess the qual­ity of teacher-child in­ter­ac­tions and the qual­ity of learn­ing en­vi­ron­ment and ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>The team hopes to con­tinue track­ing the Skip chil­dren in later years, at Pri­mary 5 and how they per­form at the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion. Among the ques­tions the re­searchers hope to ad­dress in the fu­ture are:</p>
    <p>The per­for­mance of Skip chil­dren “later in life” in terms of their so­cio-emo­tional, phys­i­cal, and aca­demic well-be­ing. Fac­tors in early child­hood that can pre­dict how well a child does in later years – in­clud­ing the home and pre-school en­vi­ron­ment, and lit­er­acy, nu­mer­acy and ex­ec­u­tive func­tion­ing skills of chil­dren at K1.</p>
    <p>Fac­tors that may mod­er­ate the chil­dren’s de­vel­op­men­tal tra­jec­to­ries, in­clud­ing the qual­ity of school en­vi­ron­ment and peer in­flu­ences.</p>
    <p>The team will also study the ef­fect of ini­tia­tives such as the Learn­ing Sup­port Pro­gramme, which in­volves ad­di­tional sup­port for chil­dren lag­ging be­hind their peers.</p>
