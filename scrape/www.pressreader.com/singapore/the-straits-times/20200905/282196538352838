    <p>It has all the el­e­ments of a good mo­bile app game, with play­ers se­lect­ing their avatars and shoot­ing ob­sta­cles, search­ing for hid­den ob­jects and an­swer­ing quiz ques­tions, com­plete with pul­sat­ing theme mu­sic.</p>
    <p>But this gam­ing app, launched last month, is for those train­ing to be Sin­ga­pore prison of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>It took 1½ years to cre­ate the app and in­cor­po­rate it into the train­ing cur­ricu­lum. The tim­ing of its launch could not have been bet­ter, with the Covid-19 pan­demic putting a tem­po­rary stop to train­ing at­tach­ments at the phys­i­cal prisons.</p>
    <p>The first group of trainees to use the app, called the Mo­bile In­ter­ac­tive Train­ing Ap­pli­ca­tion, showed the me­dia at the Home Team Academy in Choa Chu Kang on Aug 28 how it works.</p>
    <p>One of the trainees, Sergeant Muham­mad Jaf­fariz Sid­diq Ah­mad Az­eri, said the app has helped him to vi­su­alise the prison en­vi­ron­ment. “It’s en­gag­ing, and, at the same time, it ac­tu­ally gives us a pic­ture of what to expect when we go for ground train­ing,” said the 25-year-old, who be­gan his train­ing about two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>The app com­prises seven chal­lenges across three in­ten­sity lev­els, as well as three mile­stone quests at the end of each level. They test the trainees’ knowl­edge of con­cepts in top­ics cov­ered in the course.</p>
    <p>Sergeant Neo Fang Ning, 26, an­other trainee, said she uses the app when she has time to her­self in her bunk. “We use this app for our pre­class prepa­ra­tion, so we go through the app first and take down the ques­tions we are un­sure of, and then when the les­son re­sumes, we can ask our train­ers.”</p>
    <p>The app can be ac­cessed on the trainees’ Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice-is­sued tablets.</p>
    <p>The new train­ing tool is ex­pected to ben­e­fit an av­er­age of 100 of­fi­cers un­der­go­ing the prison of­fi­cer course at the Sin­ga­pore Prison Train­ing In­sti­tute ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>Chief Warder Cheang Wei Ting, a train­ing in­struc­tor, said the app comes in handy, as “dif­fer­ent learn­ers have a dif­fer­ent learn­ing pace”.</p>
    <p>The in­struc­tor added: “I be­lieve that the knowl­edge re­ten­tion is ac­tu­ally much more than if it’s just class­room lec­tures. Through fun, they can re­tain the knowl­edge bet­ter.”</p>
