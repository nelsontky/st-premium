    <p>1 The Lego blocks of so­ci­ety</p>
    <p>New MP Zhulka­r­nain Ab­dul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC) said his maiden speech was in­spired by his six-year-old son’s love for Lego.</p>
    <p>Like the blocks that make up a Lego struc­ture, each fam­ily that makes up so­ci­ety is im­por­tant, he added.</p>
    <p>“These blocks may come in dif­fer­ent shapes or colours, just like our mul­tira­cial and re­li­gious so­ci­ety. But when con­nected to­gether, they are stronger and more beau­ti­ful.”</p>
    <p>He fur­ther said that to build a more co­he­sive so­ci­ety, Sin­ga­pore must sup­port fam­i­lies, which are akin to build­ing blocks.</p>
    <p>It must also strengthen the con­nec­tions be­tween these blocks and pro­vide space for cre­ative re­build­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>“Let us con­tinue to play our part to re­build cre­atively a more re­silient, more in­clu­sive and more vi­brant so­ci­ety than ever be­fore.</p>
    <p>“To­gether, we are greater than the sum of our parts. But if one part is de­fec­tive, then ev­ery­thing may fall apart.”</p>
    <p>2 WP’s Sylvia Lim re­sponds</p>
    <p>to two min­is­ters on race</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has not yet ar­rived at a post-racial state, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong and Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Ma­liki Os­man said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Both stressed it is im­por­tant to main­tain aware­ness of and re­spect for dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim, who had called for a re­view of race-based poli­cies on Tues­day, re­sponded, say­ing Sin­ga­pore must con­tin­u­ally re­fresh its con­ver­sa­tions on race to avoid be­com­ing os­si­fied. No­body is “pre­tend­ing... there are no racial dif­fer­ences”.</p>
    <p>She then asked if there could be an open dis­cus­sion on whether Sin­ga­pore­ans would pre­fer a race­blind pooled fund to race-based self-help groups.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran, the first chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore In­dian De­vel­op­ment As­so­ci­a­tion, asked if she was propos­ing to dis­solve such groups.</p>
    <p>“An amal­ga­ma­tion is an ef­fec­tive dis­so­lu­tion of the ex­ist­ing en­tity... Your propo­si­tion is we should have an on­go­ing di­a­logue in terms of how we can work closer to­gether. That has been hap­pen­ing all along.”</p>
    <p>3 BTS and Black­pink in the House</p>
    <p>Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines GRC) in­voked Korean pop (K-pop) boy band BTS in his par­lia­men­tary speech yes­ter­day, say­ing the Govern­ment could learn a thing or two from the group’s wildly suc­cess­ful vir­tual con­cert.</p>
    <p>Amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, BTS hosted a tick­eted 100-minute live on­line con­cert in June that saw a peak of 756,000 con­cur­rent view­ers in 107 coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries, and raked in a cool $26 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“The BTS con­cert’s paid view­er­ship of three-quar­ters of a mil­lion was the equiv­a­lent of 15 shows at a 50,000-seat sta­dium, but the con­cert was streamed from a much smaller venue,” said Mr Baey.</p>
    <p>He com­pared the con­cert venue to the in­fra­struc­ture pro­vided by the Govern­ment, and urged busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als to find in­no­va­tive ways to thrive in a postCovid-19 world. “The Govern­ment will have to be nim­bler in of­fer­ing dif­fer­ent ‘venues’ so that vir­tual con­certs and other new for­mats could be staged,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Dar­ryl David (Ang Mo Kio GRC), who spoke next, could not re­sist declar­ing he was more of a fan of K-pop girl band Black­pink.</p>
    <p>4 ‘OK boomer’ and the straw­berry gen­er­a­tion</p>
    <p>First-time MP Na­dia Ah­mad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC) suc­cinctly sum­marised the dif­fer­ences in Sin­ga­pore­ans’ lived ex­pe­ri­ences over dif­fer­ent gen­er­a­tions in her maiden speech yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Some of these dif­fer­ences have led to in­evitable clashes among baby boomers and gen­er­a­tions X, Y, Z and Al­pha, she added.</p>
    <p>“OK boomer” – a dis­mis­sive phrase used by younger peo­ple as a re­tort to older peo­ple – and the “straw­berry gen­er­a­tion” la­bel used to de­scribe the younger gen­er­a­tion as overly sen­si­tive and eas­ily bruised are ex­am­ples of re­duc­tion­ist car­i­ca­tures that “ob­fus­cate the path to find­ing com­mon ground”, she said, adding that this can lead to ten­sion in work­places and homes.</p>
    <p>“If we truly want to har­ness the po­ten­tial of youth and tap into the ex­pe­ri­ences of se­niors, then we must not be dis­mis­sive of their thoughts, dreams and fears,” said Ms Na­dia.</p>
    <p>She added t hat t he mid­dle ground, which has been care­fully built up over the years, should be en­larged, not shrunk.</p>
    <p>5 The heated de­bate af­ter Ja­mus Lim’s speech</p>
    <p>WP’s econ­o­mist Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) sparked a pro­tracted de­bate with his maiden speech, which fo­cused on min­i­mum wage and “com­pas­sion­ate pol­i­cy­mak­ing”.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral sug­ges­tions he made prompted questions and com­ments from seven PAP MPs, in­clud­ing Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim’s fel­low WP MP Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) also joined the fray to re­spond to com­ments made by Ms Gan Siow Huang (Mary­mount), Mr Zaqy Mo­hamad (Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC) and Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC).</p>
    <p>Prof Lim agreed, af­ter t he quizzing, that it was not the right time to im­ple­ment a min­i­mum wage, but sug­gested it could be rolled out “af­ter the storm has passed”.</p>
    <p>He said he did not know what level of min­i­mum wage would be ap­pro­pri­ate for Sin­ga­pore, and sug­gested an in­de­pen­dent panel be formed to study this.</p>
    <p>The ex­changes lasted 35 min­utes be­fore Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin called on the House to move on.</p>
