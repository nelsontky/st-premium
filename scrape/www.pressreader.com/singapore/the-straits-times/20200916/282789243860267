    <p>After stop­ping in Sin­ga­pore for his se­ries David Rocco’s Dolce South­east Asia – which airs at 10pm on Mon­days on Na­tional Geo­graphic (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 201 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 411) – the Cana­dian celebrity chef chats with The Straits Times about the is­land’s food cul­ture, re­cre­at­ing chilli crab and his dogged at­tempts to learn to like durian.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE’S HAWKER CEN­TRES ARE ‘NEXT-LEVEL’</p>
    <p>The Toronto-based chef, cook­book au­thor and host of the Ital­ian food se­ries David Rocco’s Dolce Vita (2010 to present) stopped in Cam­bo­dia, Malaysia, Thai­land, Viet­nam and Sin­ga­pore to film a South-east Asian ver­sion of his show, and met hawk­ers, artists and ac­tivists in each coun­try to find out what makes it tick.</p>
    <p>Asked what sets Sin­ga­pore apart, the 50-year-old says: “It is prob­a­bly one of the best food towns in the world.”</p>
    <p>“It re­ally has so much to of­fer – you have the push from the busi­ness com­mu­nity, which has a taste for great cui­sine, but you can also eat re­ally well cheaply at hawker cen­tres,” he says in a re­cent video call from Toronto.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one in my crew was shocked by how much I ate at the hawker cen­tre,” he re­calls with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“To me, it was the qual­ity of the hawker stalls, from the chilli crab and the sa­tay to the bar­be­cued st­ingray with sam­bal. They are not like food­courts any­where else in the world – these are next-level.”</p>
    <p>He was also struck by the sense of com­mu­nity, he adds. “How you can join some­one at a ta­ble – if the um­brella or the pa­per nap­kin isn’t on the chair – and you can have an in­cred­i­ble meal that isn’t very ex­pen­sive.”</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>HE LEARNT TO MAKE CHILLI CRAB AND BUBUR CHA CHA</p>
    <p>In the episode filmed in Sin­ga­pore, Rocco en­thu­si­as­ti­cally tucks into var­i­ous dishes and says he tried to recre­ate a few in his own kitchen later.</p>
    <p>“I made bubur cha cha be­cause I find it ab­so­lutely de­li­cious. It’s my type of dish be­cause it’s heavy and warm, and kind of like a big hug from a nonna, or Ital­ian grand­mother.”</p>
    <p>He also did his best to make Sin­ga­pore’s iconic chilli crab when he was back home in Toronto, where he lives with his wife and busi­ness part­ner Nina, 51, and their three chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“Aside from cre­at­ing a smoke show in the kitchen, it was pretty good,” he says.</p>
    <p>But it was not quite the same as what he ate in Sin­ga­pore – in part</p>
    <p>be­cause, he says sheep­ishly, “I have to con­fess: I don’t have a wok. I just did it in a fry­ing pan and I know the heat has to be re­ally hot. But it was good”.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>ITAL­IAN AND ASIAN FOOD CUL­TURES ARE SIM­I­LAR</p>
    <p>Rocco, the son of Ital­ian im­mi­grants and an ex­pert on Ital­ian cui­sine, be­lieves Italy has much in com­mon with Asia when it comes to food and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“With the In­di­ans, the Chi­nese and the Ital­ians, you have the ma­tri­arch – the mother is such a strong fig­ure, es­pe­cially for men.</p>
    <p>“We’re all usu­ally afraid of our moth­ers,” he says, chuck­ling. “And</p>
    <p>of­ten the men are a lot qui­eter and the women take the lead.”</p>
    <p>These cul­tures also share “that sense of com­mu­nal eat­ing”, he adds. “When I’m walk­ing through Toronto, I see a lot of peo­ple eat­ing by them­selves. But in Asia, there is more of that as­so­ci­a­tion that food is meant to be shared.”</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>HE IS NOT A BIG FAN OF DURIAN, BUT WANTS TO CHANGE THAT</p>
    <p>Most would give up if their first en­counter with the odor­if­er­ous fruit was not a pleas­ant one, but Rocco is de­ter­mined to de­velop an ap­pre­ci­a­tion for it.</p>
    <p>“I had a few bad ex­pe­ri­ences with it. One was my first time in Singa</p>
    <p>pore about 12 years ago and I just died hav­ing it. I think I was prob­a­bly given the strong­est-tast­ing va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>“Then I had it again, be­cause I’ll al­ways try things and I am a trouper. And the last two times I had it, there was this slight shift in my un­der­stand­ing of its flavour,” he says. The chef has since tasted it about nine or 10 times.</p>
    <p>“The last time, it was caramelise­d and kind of cooked down into a spicy durian sam­bal, it was re­ally in­ter­est­ing.</p>
    <p>“I can’t say it was de­li­cious, but it was good.”</p>
    <p>David Rocco’s Dolce South­east Asia airs on Mon­days at 10pm on Na­tional Geo­graphic (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 201 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 411).</p>
