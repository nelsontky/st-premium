    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte’s top lieu­tenants are strug­gling to con­tain the fall­out from an un­sanc­tioned Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion of top Cabi­net min­is­ters and mem­bers of an elite mil­i­tary unit, amid cries for ac­count­abil­ity from govern­ment crit­ics and health ad­vo­cates.</p>
    <p>De­fence Sec­re­tary Delfin Loren­zana said in an in­ter­view with ABS-CBN News yes­ter­day that the vac­cine doses used were “smug­gled” but that he felt what hap­pened was “jus­ti­fied”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Mr Loren­zana and other se­nior of­fi­cials con­firmed that at least one min­is­ter and Mr Duterte’s body­guards were given jabs of China’s Sinopharm Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Health reg­u­la­tors said they would in­ves­ti­gate since this vac­cine has yet to re­ceive sanc­tion for use in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>They added that since they had not cleared the vac­cine doses to be im­ported, cer­tain laws might have been bro­ken.</p>
    <p>Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Je­sus Du­rante, head of the Pres­i­den­tial Se­cu­rity Guard (PSG), said in a tele­vised in­ter­view yes­ter­day that he felt com­pelled to have some of his men in­oc­u­lated be­cause they pro­vide close-in se­cu­rity to Mr Duterte, who at 75 is highly vul­ner­a­ble to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Some 4,000 men serve in the PSG, although not all are as­signed to Mr Duterte.</p>
    <p>Brig-Gen Du­rante re­vealed that those in the PSG who worked in close prox­im­ity to Mr Duterte were given two doses of Sinopharm’s vac­cine in Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>At the time, the vac­cine had not re­ceived reg­u­la­tory ap­proval any­where in the world.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts con­tinue to ques­tion data sup­port­ing claims that the vac­cine is 79 per cent ef­fec­tive against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque said the vac­cine was “safe” to use in the Philip­pines, cit­ing its mass use in China.</p>
    <p>Brig-Gen Du­rante said his com­mand found Sinopharm’s vac­cine “ap­pro­pri­ate”.</p>
    <p>“We’ve done our re­search. We found the ap­pro­pri­ate vac­cine for us… So, we took the risk,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that it was the PSG’s own ini­tia­tive, with­out or­ders from Mr Duterte or the mil­i­tary’s top brass. “We vac­ci­nated our­selves. It’s so easy,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Loren­zana said Brig-Gen Du­rante and the PSG would have to ex­plain their ac­tions, but that he per­son­ally felt they were “jus­ti­fied”. “The vac­cines were not fake and there seem to be no ad­verse side ef­fects,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that there were prob­a­bly no more than 300 PSG men who were vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>But Mr Duterte’s crit­ics said this “se­cret vac­ci­na­tion” was a set­back for the govern­ment’s vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme be­cause it un­der­mined the author­ity of reg­u­la­tors and sug­gested health work­ers would not be pri­ori­tised by the govern­ment to get vac­ci­nated first. “This was un­safe and il­le­gal,” Se­na­tor Risa Hon­tiveros said.</p>
    <p>The Health Pro­fes­sion­als Al­liance Against Covid-19 is­sued a state­ment call­ing for a “safe and trans­par­ent” vac­cine roll-out.</p>
