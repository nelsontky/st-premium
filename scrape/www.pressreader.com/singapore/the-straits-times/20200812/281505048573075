    <p>Sin­ga­pore suf­fered its deep­est eco­nomic slump on record in the sec­ond quar­ter, prompt­ing the Gov­ern­ment to trim its growth out­look for the year and warn of more job losses.</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic still rag­ing, the road to re­cov­ery is likely to be long and rough, said Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is ex­pected to shrink be­tween 5 per cent and 7 per cent this year, said the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI), di­alling down its pre­vi­ous fore­cast of a 4 per cent to 7 per cent con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker mea­sures ex­acted a steep toll dur­ing the sec­ond quar­ter, as the econ­omy shrank 13.2 per cent from a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“This is our worst quar­terly per­for­mance on record,” said Mr Chan. “The fore­cast for 2020 es­sen­tially means the growth gen­er­ated over the past two to three years will be negated.</p>
    <p>“Some are still hop­ing for a quick re­cov­ery, and a re­turn to the fa­mil­iar­ity of the old nor­mal. The painful truth is this – we are not re­turn­ing to a pre-Covid world, re­cov­ery will be some time yet and is not likely to be smooth,” he told re­porters at a vir­tual brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures from April 7 to June 1 ate into do­mes­tic de­mand, ex­ter­nal de­mand also re­mained weak on ac­count of the global down­turn.</p>
    <p>De­mand is ex­pected to pick up as do­mes­tic con­sump­tion gets back on track and lock­downs are lifted else­where, said Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Trade and In­dus­try Gabriel Lim. The gross do­mes­tic prod­uct is likely to shrink more grad­u­ally in the third and fourth quar­ters, year on year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is still con­sid­er­able un­cer­tainty over fu­ture growth prospects, Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>“Many of Sin­ga­pore’s key fi­nal de­mand mar­kets... are also ex­pected to ex­pe­ri­ence a more grad­ual pace of re­cov­ery in the sec­ond half of 2020 due to the threat of lo­calised out­breaks,” he noted.</p>
    <p>While a shrink­ing econ­omy could hurt the job mar­ket fur­ther, ef­forts are un­der way to cush­ion the blow.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said yes­ter­day that a key fo­cus now is to help com­pa­nies re­tain as many of their work­ers as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>About 92,000 jobs, trainee­ships or work at­tach­ments have been made avail­able to job seek­ers, as part of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age. Most of these are roles for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>About 24,000 of these po­si­tions were filled as at the end of last month, which is “quite en­cour­ag­ing”, said Mrs Teo. About six in 10 are short-term po­si­tions for up to 12 months.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the labour mar­ket is ex­pected to re­main soft in the com­ing quar­ter, noted the Min­istry of Man­power’s divi­sional di­rec­tor for plan­ning and pol­icy Kenny Tan. “Busi­nesses will still re­main very cau­tious about hir­ing, so there’s a damp­en­ing of hir­ing de­mand, and we will ex­pect in­creased pres­sure to re­trench,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, said ex­ter­nal de­mand will re­main rel­a­tively weak, with ma­jor economies like the United States, Aus­tralia and Hong Kong com­bat­ing lo­calised out­breaks, cou­pled with de­lays in the re­open­ing of in­ter­na­tional bor­ders.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore up­graded yes­ter­day its 2020 fore­casts for non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports, pro­ject­ing 3 per cent to 5 per cent year-onyear growth, com­pared with an ear­lier es­ti­mate of a 1 per cent to 4 per cent fall. This is partly be­cause de­mand in the elec­tron­ics and pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing clus­ters could con­tinue to re­main strong in the sec­ond half of the year.</p>
    <p>An­other bright spot is the biomed­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing clus­ter, be­ing driven by the de­mand for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and bi­o­log­i­cal prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing de­mand for dig­i­tal pay­ment ser­vices and for dig­i­tal so­lu­tions is also ex­pected to keep the fi­nance and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions sec­tors ro­bust.</p>
    <p>How­ever, MTI ex­pects the down­turn in con­struc­tion and marine and off­shore en­gi­neer­ing to deepen.</p>
