    <p>Led by star player Devin Booker, the Phoenix Suns kept alive their out­side chances of a play-off berth in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) league. They edged out cham­pi­onship con­tenders Los An­ge­les Clip­pers 117-115 on Tues­day for a third straight win since the sea­son restarted af­ter the coron­avirus hia­tus.</p>
    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • The Phoenix Suns were the worst team in the Western Con­fer­ence and the joint sec­ond-worst team in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) last sea­son, so few could have fore­seen their im­prove­ment this year.</p>
    <p>With the eighth and fi­nal seeds Mem­phis Griz­zlies three games ahead, they re­main an out­side bet to se­cure post-sea­son qual­i­fi­ca­tion for the first time since the 2009-10 sea­son. But their form since the restart of the NBA last week has given them ev­ery chance to do the near un­think­able.</p>
    <p>The Suns (29-39) ex­tended their per­fect start at Dis­ney World on Tues­day, de­feat­ing cham­pi­onship con­tenders Los An­ge­les Clip­pers 117-115 for their third vic­tory in as many games.</p>
    <p>It was their mar­quee player, Devin Booker, who came to the fore again. The guard, in his fifth sea­son with Phoenix, has im­proved year af­ter year, earn­ing his first All-Star nom­i­na­tion this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers, like so many other teams this term, strug­gled to con­tain the 23-year-old, who led all scor­ers with a 35-point ef­fort that was capped by a buzzer-beat­ing, turn­around jumper over fel­low All­Star Paul George, with Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard in close at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>Led by Booker’s six-of-nine three-point at­tempts, the Suns, who are the last un­beaten team since the NBA moved to the bub­ble, shot a blis­ter­ing 53.1 per cent from be­yond the arc.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, the Clip­pers (45-22), who were paced by 27 points from Leonard, shot a dis­mal eight-of-29 from long range, with none of their play­ers mak­ing more than one three-pointer.</p>
    <p>This was in sharp con­trast to their fran­chise record of 25 three­p­oint­ers in the win over the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans last Satur­day, but the Suns never gave them the same free­dom of the court.</p>
    <p>Since Booker’s 2015-16 de­but sea­son, he now has three game-win­ning buzzer-beat­ers, the joint-most in the league, in­clud­ing the post-sea­son, along­side LeBron James.</p>
    <p>His poker face while ly­ing on the court af­ter drain­ing the fade­away sparked vi­ral memes. Even Lak­ers star James chimed in, post­ing an In­sta­gram story video, say­ing, “that boy too cold”.</p>
    <p>On the game-win­ner, Booker, who dur­ing the game also be­came the sixth-youngest player in NBA his­tory to reach the 7,500 ca­reer­points mile­stone af­ter James, Kevin Du­rant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, and Tracy McGrady, said: “I’m not a big cel­e­bra­tion guy.</p>
    <p>“They (my team­mates) caught me on the ground so I couldn’t get away from them. This is a fun team to be a part of and we’re hav­ing fun with it. This whole ex­pe­ri­ence... we just wanted to come down here and make some noise and that’s what we’re do­ing.”</p>
    <p>Phoenix have five reg­u­lar-sea­son games as they bid to ex­tend their stay in the bub­ble and their coach Monty Wil­liams later told re­porters that Booker “would be the first one to tell you we’re not done (here)”.</p>
    <p>In the other key game of the day, Damian Lil­lard paced Port­land with 21 points as the Trail Blaz­ers beat the Hous­ton Rock­ets 110-102 to move within 11/ games of the</p>
