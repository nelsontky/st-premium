    <p>The fam­ily of a man de­tained for killing three church­go­ers in France weeks af­ter leav­ing his home in Tu­nisia said they are strug­gling to be­lieve he car­ried out the at­tack.</p>
    <p>“It’s not nor­mal,” said Brahim Is­saoui’s brother, Yas­sine, in­cred­u­lous that his sib­ling was re­spon­si­ble for the at­tack, which came amid wide­spread anger among Mus­lims over com­ments by French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron had strongly de­fended sec­u­lar val­ues and the right to free speech af­ter a French school­teacher, who had shown his class car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad, was mur­dered last month in a Paris sub­urb.</p>
    <p>Is­saoui, 21, is in se­ri­ous con­di­tion af­ter be­ing shot mul­ti­ple times by po­lice in the af­ter­math of last Thurs­day’s bru­tal knife at­tack in the south­ern city of Nice.</p>
    <p>Born to a fam­ily of mod­est means in the cen­tral Tu­nisian city of Sfax, Is­saoui had turned to re­li­gion and iso­lated him­self in the past two years, his rel­a­tives told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“He prayed... (and) went from home to work and back, not mix­ing with oth­ers or l eav­ing the house,” said his mother, Ms Gamra, cry­ing as she clutched a pass­port photo of the young man in a white hoodie.</p>
    <p>But be­fore that, “he drank al­co­hol and used drugs. I used to tell him, ‘we are poor and you’re wast­ing money?’ He would re­ply, ‘if God wills it, he will guide me to the right path, it’s my busi­ness’,” she added.</p>
    <p>But Is­saoui’s re­cent re­li­gios­ity did not mean he had be­come an ex­trem­ist driven to mur­der, said his sis­ter, Aida.</p>
    <p>“Our brother isn’t a killer, he isn’t a ter­ror­ist, he isn’t an ex­trem­ist,” she said. “If it was re­ally him that did this, it’s be­cause some­one made him.”</p>
    <p>Tu­nisia last Thurs­day strongly con­demned the at­tack and said it would launch an in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties there said the young man had a crim­i­nal record re­lated to vi­o­lence and drugs but noth­ing linked to ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>One of 11 sib­lings, Is­saoui lived with his par­ents in a mod­est house on a pot­holed road in a work­ing­class neigh­bour­hood near an in­dus­trial zone on the out­skirts of Sfax, a city 270km south-east of Tu­nisia’s cap­i­tal Tu­nis.</p>
    <p>Is­saoui had dropped out of school and worked as a mo­tor­cy­cle me­chanic. Hav­ing put some money aside, he opened an un­li­censed petrol sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fail­ing to reach Europe the first time, he suc­ceeded the sec­ond time, reach­ing Italy and find­ing work har­vest­ing olives, his brother said, be­fore he made his way to France.</p>
    <p>“He said he went to France be­cause it was bet­ter for work and there were too many peo­ple in Italy,” Yas­sine said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a third per­son was taken into cus­tody in France on Fri­day in con­nec­tion with the Nice knife at­tack, as the gov­ern­ment ramps up se­cu­rity ef­forts against pos­si­ble mil­i­tant at­tacks.</p>
    <p>The first de­tainee, a 47-year-old man, was held on Thurs­day evening af­ter be­ing seen next to the at­tacker on sur­veil­lance footage the day be­fore the at­tack.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond in­di­vid­ual, sus­pected of con­tact­ing Is­saoui the day be­fore the at­tack, was held on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said yes­ter­day that the third man, aged 33, was ar­rested af­ter be­ing present when the home of the sec­ond sus­pect was raided.</p>
