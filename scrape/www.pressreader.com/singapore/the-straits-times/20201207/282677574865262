    <p>1 Set</p>
    <p>healthy rou­tines</p>
    <p>Ms Jean Koh, as­sis­tant direc­tor of Cir­cle of Care, a pro­gramme to help young chil­dren from low-in­come fam­i­lies, en­cour­ages par­ents to build healthy habits and rou­tines. In­tro­duce habits such as sleep­ing and wak­ing ear­lier, and count­ing money to buy food for re­cess. Have fixed times for meals, play and sleep; teach your child how to pack his or her bag ac­cord­ing to the school timetable and share with him or her what to ex­pect the next day. Dr Geral­dine Teo-Zuzarte, direc­tor of English cur­ricu­lum in child de­vel­op­ment at NTUC First Cam­pus, says set­ting up a timetable will help chil­dren pre­dict what will hap­pen each day as well as af­ter school.</p>
    <p>Par­ents can also take a few trips to and from school to fa­mil­iarise their child with the time needed to get ready.</p>
    <p>2 Help your child man­age emo­tions</p>
    <p>“Nav­i­gat­ing their emo­tions and com­mu­ni­cat­ing their needs is im­por­tant. This will help chil­dren to seek help when re­quired and also help them build friend­ships with their peers,” says Ms Koh.</p>
    <p>• Help your child to la­bel his or her emo­tions and feel­ings. Use sim­ple words he or she can un­der­stand, such as happy, sad or an­gry. Dis­cuss in­ci­dents that hap­pened to your child and how they made him or her feel. Talk about the ways your child can re­spond when hav­ing neg­a­tive emo­tions.</p>
    <p>Use sto­ry­books or pic­tures that link to in­ci­dents in your child’s life to help him or her re­late.</p>
    <p>• Fo­cus on af­firm­ing your child’s ef­fort and progress and avoid com­par­ing him or her with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>3 Build strong bonds</p>
    <p>Hav­ing healthy re­la­tion­ships with par­ents can help chil­dren de­velop good so­cial and emo­tional skills, so that they can build and sus­tain friend­ships, says Ms Koh.</p>
    <p>• Set aside time daily to give the child your full at­ten­tion with­out dis­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>• Lis­ten re­spect­fully when your child wants to tell you about some­thing happy or sad, and show in­ter­est in con­ver­sa­tions about top­ics he or she is ea­ger to talk about.</p>
    <p>• Talk about changes that will come with go­ing to Pri­mary 1, such as what hap­pens in school. At the end of each day, ask spe­cific ques­tions about how your child is feel­ing in­stead of a generic “How was your day?”. Ex­am­ples of such ques­tions in­clude “What made you happy to­day?” or “Did any­thing make you up­set to­day?”.</p>
    <p>4 De­velop</p>
    <p>in­de­pen­dence</p>
    <p>Dr Teo-Zuzarte says par­ents can in­volve their child in get­ting ready for school, for ex­am­ple, in buying a school bag, choos­ing a wa­ter bot­tle or la­belling items so the child feels he or she is a part of the process.</p>
    <p>She rec­om­mends “help­ing chil­dren with be­com­ing in­de­pen­dent as well as build­ing a sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity to­wards their own be­long­ings and tasks”, adding that the young ones will need to be able to take in­struc­tions and di­rec­tions for home­work and projects, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Have a note­book for your child to write or draw what he or she needs to prepare for the next day as this de­vel­ops own­er­ship and ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>• Let chil­dren prac­tise car­ry­ing their own bags and wa­ter bot­tles on fam­ily out­ings so they have a sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
