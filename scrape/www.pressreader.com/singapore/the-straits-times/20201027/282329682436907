    <p>Ikhsan Fandi’s fine scor­ing form con­tin­ued for FK Jerv when he net­ted a brace in their 4-2 home win over Oy­gar­den in the Nor­we­gian First Di­vi­sion last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>In do­ing so, the 21-year-old Sin­ga­porean foot­baller has now reached the milestone of 10 league goals in Europe. The only other Lion to do so was his fa­ther Fandi Ah­mad, who scored 11 goals for Dutch club Gronin­gen from 1983 to 1985.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “It al­ways feels great to score, and get­ting to 10 is some­thing spe­cial, but I know I can do more and get bet­ter, and I will keep work­ing on im­prov­ing in all as­pects of my game, reach­ing the next level, and mak­ing it in a top Euro­pean league.</p>
    <p>“There is no real rea­son be­hind my scor­ing form, I just do my best to train well and be fo­cused in the game to put away the chances that come my way.”</p>
    <p>For his ef­forts, Ikhsan also made it to the Team of the Week for the sec­ond-tier league for the first time.</p>
    <p>With the win, Jerv rise to sixth and oc­cupy the fi­nal pro­mo­tion play-off spot in the 16-team league af­ter 21 games.</p>
    <p>Ikhsan had joined Nor­we­gian sec­ond-tier side Rau­foss last year and scored six times in 37 games (14 starts), be­fore he moved across the di­vi­sion to Jerv on Oct 5.</p>
    <p>He made his Jerv de­but with a 15-minute cameo in a 3-2 away win over HamKam, be­fore scor­ing the first equaliser in a 4-2 home win over his old club in his first start.</p>
    <p>In their next game, he recorded an­other header to open the scor­ing in the 2-1 home win over Ul­len­saker/Kisa. Ham­pered by a knee in­jury, he came on as a 74th-minute sub­sti­tute in their 1-1 draw with Kongsvinge­r on Oct 17.</p>
    <p>Re­stored to the start­ing line-up against Oy­gar­den, he demon­strated a poacher’s in­stinct to turn in the ball af­ter a goal-mouth scram­ble in the 50th minute, and headed in a cor­ner 14 min­utes later.</p>
    <p>He has now scored in each of his three starts for Jerv and played a key role in their un­beaten five­match run.</p>
    <p>Jerv coach Arne Sand­sto said: “He is a very strong finisher with both his head and feet. As a team, we pro­duce many goal op­por­tu­ni­ties, which suits him well.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that with us, he will im­prove phys­i­cally and learn how to make clever moves to be stronger on the pitch and es­pe­cially in the box.”</p>
