    <p>A long-awaited re­port into Aus­tralia’s dev­as­tat­ing bush fires last sum­mer has pro­vided an omi­nous in­sight into a post-global warm­ing fu­ture and raised ques­tions about where Aus­tralians should live and the types of homes they live in.</p>
    <p>A Royal Com­mis­sion in­quiry into the fires that be­gan late last year and stretched into this year found that cli­mate change was lead­ing to more in­tense and cat­a­strophic nat­u­ral dis­as­ters.</p>
    <p>“The sum­mer of 2019-2020 – in which some com­mu­ni­ties ex­pe­ri­enced drought, heat­waves, bush fires, hail­storms, and flood­ing – pro­vided only a glimpse of the types of events that Aus­tralia may face in the fu­ture,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­ral dis­as­ters are ex­pected to be­come more com­plex, more un­pre­dictable, and more dif­fi­cult to man­age.”</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion high­lighted the need for Aus­tralia to con­sider how and where to build homes, busi­nesses and in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>It heard ev­i­dence that more than 380,000 prop­er­ties are in high risk nat­u­ral dis­as­ter ar­eas – a statis­tic that is not sur­pris­ing given that even some densely-pop­u­lated sub­urbs of Syd­ney and Mel­bourne are sur­rounded by forests that reg­u­larly ex­pe­ri­ence fires.</p>
    <p>But the com­mis­sion also heard that the grow­ing threat from more ex­treme dis­as­ters such as fires and flood­ing meant that 735,000 prop­er­ties would be in high risk ar­eas by 2100, even if no new homes were built.</p>
    <p>“How towns and ci­ties are planned and the man­ner in which homes and in­fra­struc­ture are built have long last­ing ram­i­fi­ca­tions,” the re­port said. “These de­ci­sions in­flu­ence the ex­po­sure and vul­ner­a­bil­ity of com­mu­ni­ties and as­sets.”</p>
    <p>Bush fires are a reg­u­lar oc­cur­rence in Aus­tralia, where vast swathes of ter­ri­tory are cov­ered by thick dense bush land that can turn into a tin­der­box in dry weather.</p>
    <p>The 2019-2020 fires killed 33 peo­ple across the coun­try and de­stroyed more than 3,100 prop­er­ties. The In­sur­ance Coun­cil of Aus­tralia has said that 99 per cent of build­ings de­stroyed were within 500m of bush land.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the fires razed more than 24 mil­lion ha of land, pro­duc­ing smoke that con­trib­uted to hun­dreds of fur­ther deaths due to car­dio­vas­cu­lar and res­pi­ra­tory ef­fects. Al­most three bil­lion an­i­mals were also killed or dis­placed, threat­en­ing na­tive species and caus­ing long-term eco­log­i­cal con­se­quences. The to­tal es­ti­mated cost of the fires was more than A$10 bil­lion (S$9.79 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The Royal Com­mis­sion, chaired by a for­mer chief of the de­fence force, Re­tired Air Chief Mar­shal Mark Bin­skin, rec­om­mended that the state and fed­eral au­thor­i­ties con­sider in­tro­duc­ing a na­tion­wide pro­ce­dure for in­form­ing res­i­dents and po­ten­tial home buy­ers about the risks of in­di­vid­ual prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the com­mis­sion said state gov­ern­ments and lo­cal coun­cils should be re­quired to con­sider the dis­as­ter risk in spe­cific ar­eas when deciding whether to al­low con­struc­tion of new build­ings.</p>
    <p>“Devel­op­ment in high-risk ar­eas should be avoided un­less risk can be clearly com­mu­ni­cated and cost­ef­fec­tively man­aged,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion also heard that some 90 per cent of build­ings in ar­eas prone to bush fires do not sat­isfy cur­rent build­ing safety re­quire­ments be­cause they were con­structed be­fore the lat­est stan­dards were in­tro­duced. But up­grad­ing all prop­er­ties in Aus­tralia would cost bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion rec­om­mended that state gov­ern­ments and lo­cal coun­cils con­sider pro­vid­ing sub­si­dies to home own­ers to en­cour­age them to up­grade homes or re­duce the risk to their prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the com­mis­sion’s 80 rec­om­men­da­tions, Fed­eral Min­is­ter for Emer­gency Man­age­ment David Lit­tleproud com­mit­ted to “ac­tion­ing many of the rec­om­men­da­tions as soon as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>“The Royal Com­mis­sion re­port out­lines lessons for us all on how to bet­ter pre­pare for, man­age and re­cover from nat­u­ral dis­as­ters,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“There are lessons for gov­ern­ments, es­sen­tial ser­vice providers, in­sur­ers, char­i­ties, com­mu­ni­ties and in­di­vid­u­als.”</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cantly, the com­mis­sion noted the ef­fects of cli­mate change, say­ing that fur­ther warm­ing over the next 20 to 30 years was in­evitable. It did not make spe­cific rec­om­men­da­tions about emis­sion tar­gets, but ob­served: “Cat­a­strophic fire con­di­tions may ren­der tra­di­tional bush fire pre­dic­tion mod­els and firefighti­ng tech­niques less ef­fec­tive.”</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Lib­eral-Na­tional coali­tion has been reluc­tant to im­pose strict car­bon emis­sion re­duc­tion mea­sures or em­brace am­bi­tious green en­ergy tar­gets.</p>
    <p>Dis­cussing the com­mis­sion’s re­port, an ex­pert on fire sci­ence, Pro­fes­sor David Bow­man of the University of Tas­ma­nia, called for pub­lic mon­i­tor­ing of the im­ple­men­ta­tion of its rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>“Fun­da­men­tally, po­lit­i­cal ap­petite will de­ter­mine whether the royal com­mis­sion’s rec­om­men­da­tions ever be­come re­al­ity,” Prof Bow­man wrote on The Con­ver­sa­tion web­site. “There is much work to be done by gov­ern­ments and oth­ers… And the Morrison govern­ment has given next to no in­di­ca­tion it’s will­ing to se­ri­ously tackle the prob­lem of cli­mate change.”</p>
