    <p>COLOGNE (Ger­many) • Two years on from the em­bar­rass­ment of be­ing sacked as Spain coach on the eve of the 2018 World Cup, Julen Lopetegui has re­built his rep­u­ta­tion to take Sevilla back to a sixth Europa League fi­nal in 14 years.</p>
    <p>A re­turn to the fi­nal of Europe’s sec­ond-tier club com­pe­ti­tion for the first time since 2016, on top of a first top-four fin­ish in three Span­ish La Liga sea­sons, is sweet vin­di­ca­tion for him.</p>
    <p>A night­mare few months in 2018 had threat­ened to de­rail a coach­ing ca­reer that was blos­som­ing un­til his sack­ing just be­fore the World</p>
    <p>Cup in Rus­sia. Spain were on a 20-game un­beaten run, but the Spa­niard’s ac­cep­tance of the Real Madrid job while still em­ployed by the na­tional team was not taken to kindly by Span­ish fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Luis Ru­biales, who fired him be­fore their open­ing match against Por­tu­gal.</p>
    <p>Lopetegui lasted just 14 games at Real and was sacked again in Oc­to­ber 2018. He was out of the game un­til Sevilla of­fered a shot at re­demp­tion in June last year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 53-year-old has con­structed a team that is hard to beat as ev­i­denced by a club record run of 20 games with­out de­feat ei­ther side of a three-month shut­down due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Only Real and Atletico Madrid have had bet­ter de­fen­sive records in La Liga this sea­son.</p>
    <p>For sport­ing di­rec­tor Monchi, Lopetegui has been a reve­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“There are al­ways doubts un­til you re­ally know the coach,” he told Span­ish daily Marca. “Julen has pleas­antly sur­prised me. Ev­ery­one told me that he was very pro­fes­sional and he’s won me over.</p>
    <p>“When I see some­one like him, I fall in love, so I’m very happy to work with him.”</p>
    <p>De­spite hold­ing a per­fect record in their past five Europa League fi­nals, Lopetegui con­ceded Sevilla were fac­ing op­po­nents that are “made to play in the Champions League” in In­ter Mi­lan, the Ital­ian Serie A run­ners-up.</p>
    <p>“We know we have cre­ated our own strong sup­port,” he said. “The team had the pos­si­bil­ity to grow, over­come ob­sta­cles, be­cause of their hard work, sol­i­dar­ity and team spirit.”</p>
