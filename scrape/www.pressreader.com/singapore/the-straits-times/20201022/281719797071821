    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Af­ter weeks of warn­ings that cases were again on the rise, a third surge of coron­avirus in­fec­tion has firmly taken hold in the United States.</p>
    <p>The na­tion is av­er­ag­ing 59,000 new cases a day, the most since the be­gin­ning of Au­gust, and the coun­try is on pace to record the most new daily cases of the en­tire pan­demic in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>But if ear­lier surges were de­fined by acute and con­cen­trated out­breaks – in the north-east in spring, and in the south dur­ing the sum­mer – the virus is now sim­mer­ing at a wor­ri­some level across nearly the en­tire coun­try.</p>
    <p>Illi­nois, Ken­tucky, Michi­gan, Mon­tana, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, Wis­con­sin and Wy­oming each set seven-day case records on Tues­day. Even New Jer­sey, once a model for bring­ing the virus un­der con­trol, has seen cases dou­ble over the past month.</p>
    <p>“It is a re­ally dan­ger­ous time,” said Dr Tom In­glesby, an in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert at the Johns Hop­kins Bloomberg School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>“(Cases in) the ma­jor­ity of states are on the rise,” he said, adding that at the same time, “there are very few places where things are sta­ble and go­ing down”.</p>
    <p>The lat­est wave threat­ens to be the worst of the pan­demic yet, com­ing as cooler weather forces peo­ple in­doors and with many Amer­i­cans feel­ing ex­hausted by months of re­stric­tions. Un­like ear­lier waves, which were met with shut­down or­ders and mask man­dates, the coun­try has shown lit­tle ap­petite for more new re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“We’re see­ing spread vir­tu­ally ev­ery­where,” said Gov­er­nor Mike DeWine of Ohio, where 69 of 88 coun­ties are now con­sid­ered “high in­ci­dence”, mean­ing at least 100 virus cases per 100,000 peo­ple in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Yet Mr DeWine, a Re­pub­li­can who was among the first gov­er­nors to shut down busi­nesses in spring and who im­posed a statewide mask man­date in sum­mer, has not an­nounced new mea­sures to curb the spread of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“The fastest way we can do it is not for me to is­sue some or­der that you can’t en­force or would be dif­fi­cult to en­force, but rather, for ev­ery Ohioan to take this se­ri­ously,” he said, grab­bing his cloth mask and hold­ing it up.</p>
    <p>The new­est surge sets the stage for a gru­elling win­ter. At the cur­rent rate of growth, new daily con­firmed cases could soon sur­pass 75,687, the record set on July 16.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing case count has so far not trans­lated to in­creased deaths: About 700 peo­ple are dy­ing on av­er­age each day, a high but steady rate. So far, more than 220,000 Amer­i­cans have died from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The lat­est de­vel­op­ments rep­re­sent a se­ri­ous new level of spread. Deaths are con­sid­ered a lag­ging in­di­ca­tor of new in­fec­tion, and ex­perts be­lieve the daily toll is likely to rise in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, the most ac­cu­rate gauge of how many peo­ple are sick from the virus, are al­ready trend­ing up­wards, at a pace slightly lower than that of new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In North Dakota, which leads the na­tion in new coron­avirus cases per capita, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and deaths are at a high, and just 20 in­ten­sive care beds were avail­able statewide.</p>
    <p>With no statewide mask man­date, some may­ors are re­sort­ing to op­tions they had long re­sisted.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the Mayor of Fargo used his emer­gency pow­ers to is­sue a manda­tory mask or­der, the first of its kind in the state.</p>
    <p>“We were hop­ing we had es­caped Covid-19,” said Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney, a prac­tis­ing sur­geon. “Now we’re just like ev­ery­body else in the coun­try. It has hit us with a vengeance.”</p>
    <p>In a sign of how quickly the virus is spread­ing in many parts of the Mid­west and the Great Plains, in­fec­tions re­cently over­whelmed a pri­vate nurs­ing home in north­ern Kansas.</p>
    <p>The nurs­ing home, Andbe Home, no­ticed the first sign of a prob­lem on Oct 7, when a sin­gle res­i­dent tested pos­i­tive. But within days, the virus had run ram­pant, sneak­ing from room to room.</p>
    <p>Two weeks later, all 62 res­i­dents who live there have been in­fected, and 10 have died. At least 12 em­ploy­ees have also tested pos­i­tive.</p>
