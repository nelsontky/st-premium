    <p>Pro­hi­bi­tion or­ders have been is­sued against a for­mer in­sur­ance agent and an ex-bank em­ployee for fraud and dis­hon­est con­duct.</p>
    <p>The or­ders took ef­fect on Tues­day and came after the two men were con­victed in un­re­lated cases in the State Courts.</p>
    <p>Aw Yong Seng, an ex-em­ployee of in­surer Pru­den­tial As­sur­ance Com­pany Sin­ga­pore, was ear­lier con­victed of forgery un­der the Pe­nal Code and sen­tenced to four months’ im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>Johnny Chew Swee Sun was jailed for eight weeks for em­ploy­ing a scheme to de­fraud and for unau­tho­rised trad­ing un­der the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act (SFA).</p>
    <p>Aw forged a doc­u­ment in June 2017 that pur­ported to be a re­ceipt is­sued by Pru­den­tial. His client had ear­lier en­trusted him with ap­prox­i­mately $25,000 in cash to be paid to Pru­den­tial as the an­nual pre­mium for the client’s pol­icy.</p>
    <p>In­stead of hand­ing over the money to Pru­den­tial, Aw used it for his own pur­poses. He forged a re­ceipt in the name of Pru­den­tial in or­der to lead his client to be­lieve that the an­nual pre­mium had been paid.</p>
    <p>After the de­cep­tion was un­cov­ered, Aw made full resti­tu­tion to Pru­den­tial and the client’s pol­icy was re­in­stated.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) has banned Aw from pro­vid­ing any fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory ser­vices for five years.</p>
    <p>He also can­not take part in man­ag­ing any fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firm un­der the Fi­nan­cial Ad­vis­ers Act (FAA) or act as a di­rec­tor or be a sub­stan­tial share­holder of one.</p>
    <p>Aw is pro­hib­ited as well from car­ry­ing on busi­ness or hold­ing a man­age­ment role in any in­sur­ance in­ter­me­di­ary un­der the In­sur­ance Act.</p>
    <p>Chew, a for­mer Bank of Sin­ga­pore em­ployee, used a scheme be­tween April 2012 and De­cem­ber 2012 to de­fraud se­cu­ri­ties firm IG Asia by plac­ing false or­ders for se­cu­ri­ties in three Sin­ga­pore-listed coun­ters.</p>
    <p>He did so in his per­sonal ca­pac­ity us­ing per­sonal trad­ing ac­counts as well as those be­long­ing to rel­a­tives and a friend.</p>
    <p>This was done with the sole pur­pose of in­flu­enc­ing the as­so­ci­ated Con­tracts for Dif­fer­ences (CFD) prices of­fered by IG Asia in his favour. The trades in the un­der­ly­ing se­cu­ri­ties were ul­ti­mately never ex­e­cuted and would be with­drawn shortly after the CFD or­ders were ex­e­cuted.</p>
    <p>Chew even­tu­ally made resti­tu­tion to IG Asia.</p>
    <p>He has now been banned for three years by the MAS from pro­vid­ing any fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory ser­vices or tak­ing part in man­ag­ing, act­ing as a di­rec­tor or be­ing a sub­stan­tial share­holder of any fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firm un­der the FAA.</p>
    <p>Chew is also pro­hib­ited from tak­ing roles in any cap­i­tal mar­ket li­censee un­der the SFA.</p>
