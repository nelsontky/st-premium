    <p>MANILA • The Philip­pines could be­come South-east Asia’s largest coro­n­avirus hot spot af­ter record­ing its big­gest sin­gle-day jump in new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, the same day a tough lock­down was reim­posed in Metro Manila and four densely pop­u­lated prov­inces of the is­land na­tion.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines recorded 6,352 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, which took the coun­try’s to­tal caseload past the 112,000 mark as the global tally in the pan­demic neared 18.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, In­done­sia has the most num­ber of cases in South­east Asia, at just over 115,000. This in­cludes 5,388 fa­tal­i­ties – more than double the 2,115 deaths recorded in the Philip­pines thus far. The global death toll has crossed 698,000, with many coun­tries ap­pear­ing to lose ground in their fight to con­trol the virus.</p>
    <p>The tough shel­ter-at-home re­stric­tions in Metro Manila and the prov­inces of Bu­la­can, Rizal, La­guna and Cavite came days af­ter health work­ers warned that the coun­try was “wag­ing a los­ing bat­tle” against the coro­n­avirus fol­low­ing the re­lax­ation of re­stric­tions in June.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to reim­pose a twoweek lock­down was taken re­luc­tantly by Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte, with ex­perts es­ti­mat­ing that the econ­omy stands to lose 12 bil­lion pe­sos (S$337 mil­lion) a day.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, too, opted to take tough steps to check the pan­demic, with the state of South Aus­tralia yes­ter­day an­nounc­ing re­stric­tions on the num­ber of peo­ple who can gather at homes and on the con­sump­tion of al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>As Aus­tralia bat­tles a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions that its gov­ern­ment has blamed on peo­ple flout­ing travel re­stric­tions, the state of Vic­to­ria rolled out tougher fines for res­i­dents caught flout­ing stay-ath­ome or­ders.</p>
    <p>Spot checks con­ducted by the Vic­to­ria au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day found that 25 per cent of peo­ple were not at home when house calls were made, which the state’s Premier Daniel An­drews dubbed “un­ac­cept­able”.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria res­i­dents can now be slapped with fines of al­most A$5,000 (S$4,900) if they are caught vi­o­lat­ing the lock­down in Vic­to­ria, up from A$1,652 pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar virus fears were mir­rored else­where, with the head of the Ger­man doc­tors’ union warn­ing that the coun­try was al­ready reck­on­ing with a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions and risks squan­der­ing its early suc­cess as peo­ple flout so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>“We are al­ready in a sec­ond, shal­low up­swing,” said Dr Su­sanne Johna, pres­i­dent of the Mar­burger Bund, which rep­re­sents doc­tors in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>In France, the num­ber of pa­tients re­quir­ing life sup­port surged, with the coun­try’s sci­en­tific coun­cil warn­ing that it is likely to ex­pe­ri­ence a sec­ond epi­demic wave in the au­tumn or win­ter. “We can switch at any time to a less con­trolled sce­nario,” it said.</p>
    <p>The US au­thor­i­ties, too, fear that fla­grant vi­o­la­tions of so­cial dis­tanc­ing norms – such as a spate of house par­ties in New Jersey that led to al­most 100 cases – could lead to the coro­n­avirus cri­sis spin­ning out of con­trol in the worst-hit coun­try in the world.</p>
    <p>The United States has seen nearly 4.9 mil­lion cases and 159,000 deaths in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in­sisted the out­break in the coun­try is un­der con­trol, tweet­ing on Mon­day: “With the ex­cep­tion of New York and a few other lo­ca­tions, we have done much bet­ter than most other coun­tries in deal­ing with the China virus. Many of these coun­tries are now hav­ing a ma­jor sec­ond wave. The fake news is work­ing over­time to make the USA (and me) look as bad as pos­si­ble!”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s as­ser­tion was i n stark con­trast to a warn­ing from White House coro­n­avirus task force co­or­di­na­tor Deb­o­rah Birx, who said on Sun­day that the virus was “ex­traor­di­nar­ily wide­spread” in Amer­ica’s ru­ral ar­eas as well as cities.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to reim­pose a two-week lock­down was taken re­luc­tantly by Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte, with ex­perts es­ti­mat­ing that the econ­omy stands to lose 12 bil­lion pe­sos (S$337 mil­lion) a day.</p>
