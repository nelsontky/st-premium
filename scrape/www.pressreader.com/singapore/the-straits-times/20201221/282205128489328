    <p>Work­ing in a for­eign land can be a daunt­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. It gets worse if one runs into trou­ble.</p>
    <p>For mi­grant work­ers, such a sit­u­a­tion can be har­row­ing.</p>
    <p>This is where Mr Daniel Yeo, a case worker with HealthServ­e, comes in. The 49-year-old en­gages with mi­grant work­ers who go to the non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion for help.</p>
    <p>Most of them are hold­ers of the Spe­cial Pass, which is is­sued for pur­poses such as as­sist­ing in in­ves­ti­ga­tions or at­tend­ing court.</p>
    <p>Those who turn to HealthServ­e usu­ally face is­sues such as salary dis­putes, or suf­fered work in­juries and have dif­fi­cul­ties get­ting paid dur­ing their med­i­cal leave.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo helps by com­mu­ni­cat­ing their prob­lems to the au­thor­i­ties such as the Min­istry of Man­power.</p>
    <p>Part of his du­ties in­clude fol­low­ing up with such work­ers at the dor­mi­to­ries, tak­ing along gro­ceries, food and, in one case, read­ing glasses. If the sit­u­a­tion calls for it, he ac­com­pa­nies the work­ers dur­ing their med­i­cal ap­point­ments and vis­its those who are hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo, who has been a case worker with HealthServ­e for five years, said his most mem­o­rable case sur­faced re­cently.</p>
    <p>It in­volved Mr Ra­haman, 38, a Bangladesh­i who suf­fered a stroke as he was bat­tling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He over­came the in­fec­tion but was paral­ysed on the left side of his body and lost his speech abil­ity be­cause of the stroke.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo wanted to do more to com­fort the pa­tient dur­ing his weekly vis­its, so he would pack Bangladesh­i food for Mr Ra­haman to have a taste of home.</p>
    <p>He also fa­cil­i­tates video calls be­tween the Bangladesh­i and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said: “Even though he couldn’t speak, I could see that he was so happy to be able to hear the voices and see the faces of his wife and daugh­ters.”</p>
    <p>HealthServ­e vol­un­teer Ab­hi­jit Biswas, 50, a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent who hails from In­dia and works in the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try, tags along in some of the vis­its. He is able to speak Ben­gali with Mr Ra­haman and his fam­ily, eas­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tion and pro­vid­ing up­dates to his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“HealthServ­e pro­vides a plat­form for me to give back to so­ci­ety and I be­lieve that the more l give, the more I re­ceive,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bu De You, 33, is an­other vol­un­teer who ac­com­pa­nies Mr Yeo dur­ing the food dis­tri­bu­tion to the dorms and vis­its to the hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese na­tional, a Spe­cial Pass holder, is await­ing a res­o­lu­tion to his prob­lems, but de­clined to go into de­tails.</p>
    <p>He said he is be­ing helped even as he is help­ing oth­ers, and is “count­ing his bless­ings” as he can see that his own is­sues are not as ma­jor. He is still healthy com­pared with some of the less for­tu­nate mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Some vol­un­teers come with more spe­cialised skills.</p>
    <p>Ms Ade­lene Teck, 47, an oc­cu­pa­tional ther­a­pist, has been vol­un­teer­ing with HealthServ­e for the past two years.</p>
    <p>She sees mostly work in­jury cases at its Gey­lang clinic, help­ing them deal with pain or move­ment is­sues. She spends about 30 to 45 min­utes with each worker and has helped about 30 so far.</p>
    <p>The world marked In­ter­na­tional Mi­grants Day last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, there are about 687,600 for­eign work­ers who are on work per­mits, and an­other 252,600 or so for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, and HealthServ­e’s work has con­trib­uted in mak­ing the Re­pub­lic a home away from home for them.</p>
    <p>HAPPY TO SEE FAM­ILY</p>
    <p>Even though he couldn’t speak, I could see that he was so happy to be able to hear the voices and see the faces of his wife and daugh­ters.</p>

    <p>PAY­ING IT FOR­WARD</p>
    <p>HealthServ­e pro­vides a plat­form for me to give back to so­ci­ety and I be­lieve that the more l give, the more I re­ceive.</p>
    <p>MR AB­HI­JIT BISWAS, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who hails from In­dia and tags along dur­ing HealthServ­e dor­mi­tory vis­its.</p>
