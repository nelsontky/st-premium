    <p>One Cham­pi­onship’s In­side the Ma­trix fight event next Fri­day will be the first live sport­ing event in Sin­ga­pore with fans dur­ing the coro­n­avirus era. The 250 spec­ta­tors at the 12,000-seat Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium will be part of a pi­lot scheme, where par­tic­i­pants in mass events have to take an anti­gen rapid test for Covid-19 and ob­tain a neg­a­tive re­sult be­fore ad­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will stage a live sport­ing event with fans next Fri­day for the first time since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, as 250 spec­ta­tors will be al­lowed in­side the 12,000-seat Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium for One Cham­pi­onship’s In­side the Ma­trix event.</p>
    <p>The mixed mar­tial arts pro­mo­tion an­nounced this yes­ter­day and said fans will need to take an anti­gen rapid test for Covid-19 at des­ig­nated clin­ics on the day of the fight be­fore ad­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>This is in ad­di­tion to other safety mea­sures such as wear­ing a mask at all times and tem­per­a­ture screen­ings. As part of the safe seat­ing plan, pa­trons who pur­chase up to five tick­ets can be seated to­gether, and dif­fer­ent groups of five will be placed two to three seats apart.</p>
    <p>Each ticket costs $148, and the cost of the anti­gen rapid test, which can pro­duce re­sults in about 30 min­utes, is com­pli­men­tary.</p>
    <p>This will be One’s se­cond event in a month. It suc­cess­fully held a closed-door pro­duc­tion at the same venue on Oct 9.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment had an­nounced on Tues­day that par­tic­i­pants in large-scale oc­ca­sions such as wed­dings, live per­for­mances, sport­ing events and busi­ness-to-busi­ness events will have to ob­tain a neg­a­tive re­sult in an anti­gen rapid test be­fore ad­mis­sion un­der a new pi­lot meant to help the coun­try re­sume more ac­tiv­i­ties safely.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases in Sin­ga­pore are gen­er­ally con­firmed with poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests. But th­ese take far longer than the anti­gen rapid test – hours at least, rather than min­utes – to process, although they are more ac­cu­rate.</p>
    <p>With lit­tle to no com­mu­nity spread in re­cent days, Dr Piotr Ch­lebicki, an in­fec­tious diseases spe­cial­ist at Mount Alver­nia Hos­pi­tal Sin­ga­pore, be­lieves that this is the right time for Sin­ga­pore to start with such test events, es­pe­cially with the strict mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “With all kinds of pre­cau­tions be­ing taken, it would be very okay to try it (al­low a small group of fans to watch the event live). Sooner or later, we will have to try more of th­ese events be­cause of the good sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>While he feels that the mea­sures for next Fri­day’s event are suf­fi­cient, he stressed that or­gan­is­ers should limit at­ten­dees to those who re­side here. Dr Ch­lebicki also feels that there is lit­tle room for er­ror as this will be a lit­mus test for other mass events to fol­low. He said: “The chal­lenge is that they will be the first and they will be very care­fully watched so they have to make sure every­thing is done prop­erly.”</p>
    <p>Strin­gent mea­sures were put in place for the Oct 9 One event, and th­ese will be fol­lowed again. Then, over­seas-based fight­ers were tested four times – be­fore they flew to Sin­ga­pore, upon ar­rival, be­fore and af­ter the fight – while oth­ers were tested twice.</p>
    <p>The ath­letes and their sup­port crew were re­quired to re­main in iso­la­tion un­til they got a neg­a­tive test re­sult. While they were here, trav­el­ling was lim­ited to the event “bub­ble”, and fight­ers had to fol­low strict sched­ules. They were ac­com­pa­nied by li­ai­son of­fi­cials at all times.</p>
    <p>Next Fri­day’s event will fea­ture six fights, in­clud­ing four world ti­tle bouts.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Paul Hoff­mann, 33, bought a ticket upon hear­ing the news. It will be his first time watch­ing a One event live.</p>
    <p>The au­di­tor, who has been in Sin­ga­pore since Oc­to­ber last year, said: “I am happy that Sin­ga­pore is go­ing back to some form of nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t ex­pect that it would hap­pen this year (be­ing able to at­tend sports events), so in the morn­ing when I saw that it was open, I thought that it was amaz­ing be­cause there are four ti­tle fights.”</p>
    <p>Other live sports here have been al­lowed to re­sume. The Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League foot­ball com­pe­ti­tion, the coun­try’s only pro­fes­sional league which had been sus­pended since March, restarted last Satur­day be­hind closed doors.</p>

For next Fri&#xAD;day&#x2019;s In&#xAD;side the Ma&#xAD;trix event, fans will need to take an anti&#xAD;gen rapid test for Covid-19 at des&#xAD;ig&#xAD;nated clin&#xAD;ics on the day of the fight be&#xAD;fore ad&#xAD;mis&#xAD;sion.
