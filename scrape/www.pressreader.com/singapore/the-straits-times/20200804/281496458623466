    <p>WASHINGTON • Amer­ica’s first crewed space­ship to fly to the In­ter­na­tional Space Sta­tion (ISS) i n nearly a decade re­turned safely to Earth on Sun­day, splash­ing down in the Gulf of Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>The mis­sion, car­ried out jointly by Nasa (Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion) and SpaceX, shows that the US has the ca­pac­ity once more to send its astro­nauts to space and bring them back.</p>
    <p>The SpaceX Crew Dragon En­deav­our splashed into the wa­ters off Pen­sacola, Florida at 2.48pm (2.48am Mon­day Sin­ga­pore time), trailed by its four main para­chutes.</p>
    <p>It was the first wa­ter land­ing for a crewed US space­ship since the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“It’s truly our hon­our and priv­i­lege,” said pi­lot Doug Hur­ley, who was joined on the mis­sion by com­man­der Bob Behnken.</p>
    <p>“On be­half of Nasa and SpaceX teams, wel­come back to planet Earth and thanks for fly­ing SpaceX,” replied SpaceX se­nior en­gi­neer Mike Heiman, to laugh­ter in the con­trol room.</p>
    <p>A flotilla of civil­ian boats swarmed the land­ing zone as a re­cov­ery ship sped to the scorched cap­sule and hoisted it aboard with its crane.</p>
    <p>The coast guard said it had warned peo­ple to stay away from the cap­sule, but “nu­mer­ous boaters” ig­nored the re­quests.</p>
    <p>The open­ing of the hatch was de­layed as a team worked to stop a po­ten­tially dan­ger­ous leak of rocket fuel vapour.</p>
    <p>Nasa ad­min­is­tra­tor Jim Bri­den­s­tine said: “What’s not com­mon is hav­ing passers-by ap­proach the ve­hi­cle at close range with ni­tro­gen­tetrox­ide in the at­mos­phere... We need to make sure we’re warn­ing peo­ple not to get close to the space­craft in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>About an hour af­ter splash­down, the astro­nauts left the cap­sule and headed for shore in a he­li­copter.</p>
    <p>A vis­i­bly ex­cited SpaceX founder Elon Musk said that the mis­sion her­alded a new era.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to go to the Moon, we’re go­ing to have a base on the Moon; we’re go­ing to Mars,” he said. “I’m not very reli­gious but I prayed for this one.”</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump – who had trav­elled to Florida for the cap­sule’s launch two months ago – hailed its safe re­turn.</p>
    <p>The United States has had to rely on Rus­sia for rides to space since the coun­try’s l ast Space Shut­tle flew in 2011.</p>
    <p>The mis­sion is also a huge win for SpaceX, which was founded i n 2002 but has leapfrogge­d its way past Boe­ing, its main com­peti­tor in the com­mer­cial space race.</p>
    <p>The US paid the two com­pa­nies a to­tal of about US$7 bil­lion (S$9.6 bil­lion) for their “space taxi” con­tracts, though aero­space gi­ant Boe­ing’s ef­forts have floun­dered.</p>
    <p>The Crew Dragon cap­sule per­formed sev­eral pre­cisely chore­ographed se­quences to re­turn home safely.</p>
    <p>First, it jet­ti­soned its “trunk” that con­tains its power, heat and other sys­tems, which burned up in the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>It then fired its thrusters to ma­noeu­vre into the proper or­bit and tra­jec­tory for splash­down. As it reen­tered the at­mos­phere at a speed of around 28,000kmh, it ex­pe­ri­enced tem­per­a­tures of 1,900 deg C.</p>
    <p>It used two sets of para­chutes on its de­scent, bring­ing its speed down as it hit the Gulf of Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>En­deav­our will now un­dergo a six-week in­spec­tion to cer­tify the ves­sel as wor­thy of fu­ture lowEarth or­bit mis­sions.</p>
    <p>The next mis­sion, dubbed “Crew-1”, will in­volve a team of four: three Nasa astro­nauts and Ja­pan Aero­space Ex­plo­ration Agency mis­sion spe­cial­ist Soichi Noguchi.</p>
    <p>The launch is set for late next month, and the crew is due to spend six months at the space sta­tion.</p>
