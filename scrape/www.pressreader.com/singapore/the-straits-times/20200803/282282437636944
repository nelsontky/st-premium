    <p>LON­DON • A lucky Lewis Hamil­ton limped to a record sev­enth home Bri­tish Grand Prix vic­tory af­ter his Mercedes suf­fered a dra­matic last­lap punc­ture yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In an as­ton­ish­ing end to a race he had dom­i­nated from pole po­si­tion, the Bri­ton hung on to stretch his For­mula One world cham­pi­onship lead to 30 points de­spite the tyre nearly fall­ing off the wheel rim.</p>
    <p>Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen fin­ished se­cond, but would have won had he not pit­ted for fresh tyres in a suc­cess­ful late bid to score an ex­tra point for the fastest lap, af­ter as­sum­ing that vic­tory was out of reach.</p>
    <p>Charles Le­clerc of Fer­rari was third, an­other sur­prise for a team strug­gling for per­for­mance, af­ter Hamil­ton’s team­mate and clos­est ri­val Valt­teri Bot­tas failed to score.</p>
    <p>He also suf­fered a late punc­ture with two laps to go to drop from se­cond to 11th, de­spite a one-two fin­ish for the pair hav­ing looked a naile­don cer­tainty un­til late in the race.</p>
    <p>“I have def­i­nitely never ex­pe­ri­enced any­thing like that on the last lap,” said six-time world cham­pion Hamil­ton af­ter in­spect­ing his de­flated front tyre. “Up un­til that, ev­ery­thing was rel­a­tively smooth sail­ing.</p>
    <p>“The tyres felt great. I heard that his (Bot­tas’) tyre went and I was just look­ing at mine and ev­ery­thing seemed fine. The car was still turn­ing no prob­lem. Those last few laps, I started to back off and then just down the straight, it just de­flated.</p>
    <p>“That was def­i­nitely a heart-inthe-mouth kind of feel­ing. You could see it fall­ing off the rim. From then, I was just man­ag­ing it and I was just pray­ing to get round and not be too slow.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t think I would make it round the last two cor­ners. I was just pray­ing to get around and not be too slow. I nearly didn’t get around the last few cor­ners. Thank God we did.”</p>
    <p>The vic­tory was the 87th of Hamil­ton’s F1 ca­reer – leav­ing him four short of equalling Fer­rari great Michael Schu­macher’s all-time record of 91 – and prob­a­bly the luck­i­est as Mercedes, chas­ing a sev­enth suc­ces­sive ti­tle dou­ble, took home their fourth che­quered flag in as many races.</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen’s race en­gi­neer summed it up over the team ra­dio, say­ing: “He’s a lucky boy.”</p>
    <p>But the Dutch­man felt that fin­ish­ing on the podium was a bonus, given the Sil­ver Ar­rows’ speed be­fore the un­fore­seen turn of events.</p>
    <p>“It was lucky and un­lucky,” he said. “Mercedes were too quick. The tyres didn’t look great with 10 laps to go, they didn’t look pretty.</p>
    <p>“Valt­teri got a punc­ture, then they boxed me to go for the fastest lap, then Lewis got a punc­ture. But se­cond is a good re­sult.</p>
    <p>“I told my en­gi­neer to drink and to stay hy­drated. It was pretty lonely; I was just man­ag­ing my pace and look­ing af­ter the tyres.”</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton and Bot­tas were not the only driv­ers to suf­fer a bad stroke of luck at the end.</p>
    <p>McLaren’s Carlos Sainz fell from fourth to 13th on the last lap be­cause of a late punc­ture, leav­ing the Spa­niard, who will join Fer­rari next sea­son, frus­trated.</p>
    <p>“I am dis­ap­pointed, not go­ing to lie,” he said. “At the same time, ev­ery­thing was done cor­rectly un­til the last two laps so I can­not be too tough on the team or my­self.”</p>
