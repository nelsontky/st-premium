    <p>UNITED STATES • The hu­man health­care sys­tem has strug­gled fi­nan­cially through the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, los­ing bil­lions from the can­cel­la­tions of lu­cra­tive elec­tive op­er­a­tions as pa­tients were first told to stay away from hos­pi­tals and then were leery of set­ting foot in one.</p>
    <p>The ca­nine and fe­line health sys­tem, though, is boom­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s crazy, in a good way,” said Dr Mar­got Vahren­wald, a vet­eri­nar­ian who co-owns Park Hill Ve­teri­nary Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Den­ver. “We’re see­ing 25 per cent more new pets than what we would nor­mally.”</p>
    <p>She added five em­ploy­ees and has job list­ings for more. Her clinic has bought two phone lines to han­dle a del­uge of calls from pet own­ers.</p>
    <p>Most ve­teri­nar­i­ans are now re­quir­ing kerb­side ser­vice – own­ers drop their pet at the door and wait out­side – less­en­ing the risk of catch­ing the coro­n­avirus. An­i­mals tend to be less sus­cep­ti­ble to it, al­though not im­mune. Some pets have be­come in­fected and last month, the first dog in the United States to test pos­i­tive for the virus died.</p>
    <p>Much of the in­crease in ve­teri­nary care seems to be for wellness vis­its and vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try pro­vides some­thing the hu­man health sys­tem does not: trans­par­ent prices. Ve­teri­nar­i­ans can pro­vide re­li­able price es­ti­mates, in part be­cause they have stan­dard charges that do not vary by type of in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>De­mand for ve­teri­nary ser­vices is cycli­cal. Pet own­ers spend more on med­i­cal care for dogs and cats when the econ­omy is strong and they have more dis­pos­able in­come. This eco­nomic down­turn is dif­fer­ent; vol­ume and rev­enue are up at an­i­mal hos­pi­tals and clin­ics.</p>
    <p>VetSuc­cess, which tracks fi­nan­cial data from 2,800 clin­ics, es­ti­mates rev­enue last month was up 18 per cent over last July. Tru­pan­ion, a pet health in­surer, an­nounced in an earn­ings call that its sec­ond-quar­ter rev­enue was up 28 per cent over last year. It has 14 per cent more cat and dog mem­bers than it did at the start of the year.</p>
    <p>Some of the newly in­sured pets have names that fit the mo­ment: Corona, Rona and Covid.</p>
    <p>Ve­teri­nar­i­ans at­tribute the in­crease in de­mand to one key fac­tor that makes this re­ces­sion dif­fer­ent from oth­ers: It has forced mil­lions more peo­ple to work from home. Some are tak­ing the op­por­tu­nity to take home new pets, with some shel­ters re­port­edly emp­tied out thanks to high de­mand.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans who al­ready have pets seem to have be­come more watch­ful of them dur­ing the long pan­demic days at home to­gether.</p>
    <p>One emer­gency vet­eri­nar­ian re­ported a rise in cases of uri­nary ob­struc­tions among cats, which may be a sign of fe­line stress – pos­si­bly a re­sult of hu­mans hang­ing around more than the cat would like.</p>
    <p>Dr Heather Loenser, se­nior ve­teri­nary of­fi­cer for the Amer­i­can An­i­mal Hos­pi­tal As­so­ci­a­tion, calls it the “star­ing at your pet” syn­drome: sub­tle dif­fer­ences that do not re­quire med­i­cal care but catch the at­ten­tion of a quar­an­tined pet owner.</p>
    <p>Some ve­teri­nar­i­ans say they are see­ing slightly sicker dogs, which may be a re­sult of own­ers putting off care at the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic. A few se­ri­ous con­di­tions may also be on the rise.</p>
    <p>BluePearl, which runs 90 pet hos­pi­tals in the US, has seen a 70 per cent in­crease in hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions for par­vovirus, a po­ten­tially deadly ail­ment that com­monly strikes un­vac­ci­nated pup­pies.</p>
    <p>“We think own­ers ear­lier in the pan­demic maybe didn’t want to go out and see a vet­eri­nar­ian or maybe couldn’t af­ford to,” said Dr James Barr, BluePearl’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer. “We think that prob­a­bly re­sulted in fewer dogs get­ting vac­ci­nated.”</p>
