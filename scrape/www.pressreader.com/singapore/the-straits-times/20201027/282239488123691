    <p>Does the fact that Lewis Hamil­ton has now scored a record 92 grand prix vic­to­ries, where a leg­end such as Sir Stir­ling Moss won only 16, re­ally mean that he is the best F1 driver in his­tory?</p>
    <p>That is a rhetor­i­cal ques­tion that each of us can only ra­tio­nalise in our own way, de­pen­dent on myr­iad per­sonal judg­ments that can never be wholly ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>Michael Schu­macher, whose record Hamil­ton fi­nally broke in Por­tu­gal on Sun­day, is of­ten quoted as say­ing he al­ways be­lieved that records were there to be bro­ken. But the truth is that when they were set, many seemed un­beat­able.</p>
    <p>I’m old enough to have been an F1 fan in Jan­uary, 1968, when the in­es­timable Jim Clark (my per­sonal best of the best), set a new record of 25 vic­to­ries in South Africa.</p>
    <p>Prior to that Alfa Romeo’s rac­ers Giuseppe Fa­rina and Juan Manuel Fan­gio had vied for the hon­our when the World Cham­pi­onship was in­au­gu­rated in May 1950.</p>
    <p>They ended the year with three apiece. Fan­gio edged that up to six in 1951. But in 1952 Fer­rari’s Al­berto As­cari, twice a win­ner in 1951, took six of the eight races to go two ahead of Fan­gio. As­cari’s streak con­tin­ued in 1953, tak­ing him to 13. Fan­gio did the win­ning in 1954 to match him, then in 1955 pushed the record to 17 and boosted it by 1957 to the 24 that Clark fi­nally beat, al­beit not for more than a decade.</p>
    <p>In­deed, it was not un­til Moss won the Moroc­can GP at the end of 1958, when the great Ar­gen­tinian had fi­nally re­tired, that an­other liv­ing driver got into dou­ble fig­ures.</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber how con­flicted my feel­ings were when Jackie Ste­wart bet­tered Clark’s mark with 26 in Hol­land in 1973 then added an­other in Ger­many, and when Alain Prost in turn beat Ste­wart with 28 in Por­tu­gal in 1987.</p>
    <p>How Prost kept go­ing against Ayr­ton Senna un­til he had amassed 51 by 1993, and how Schu­macher fi­nally beat that in 2001 in Bel­gium.</p>
    <p>Even then, I never en­vis­aged what Schu­macher and the red Fer­rari steam­roller would build over the next five years: a to­tal of 91 vic­to­ries, to Prost’s 51 and Senna’s 41. And it was just as im­pos­si­ble to en­vis­age sim­i­lar ram­pant suc­cess brew­ing when, with Schu­macher re­tired in 2006, a young kid from Steve­nage in the UK won his first race in Canada in June 2007.</p>
    <p>Of course, so much changed since the days of As­cari and Fan­gio. In 1950 there had been only six F1 races, by 2001 there were 17. And the cars were sig­nif­i­cantly more re­li­able.</p>
    <p>There was a time when the 1961 Dutch GP was the only one in which ev­ery starter had fin­ished. In the 21st cen­tury that be­came so com­mon­place that it was easy to over­look the in­nate en­gi­neer­ing bril­liance of the ma­chin­ery. But it played a huge part in what the likes of Schu­macher and, now,</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton, were able to achieve.</p>
    <p>The best cars hardly ever break down. Since he joined Mercedes for</p>
    <p>Records are a sign of progress and great­ness. The ma­chines are ev­ery bit as im­por­tant, but the record break­ers are the men whose com­mit­ment and level of per­for­mance is im­pla­ca­ble and im­pec­ca­ble, who can not only win with the best car, but some­times with one that isn’t.</p>
    <p>the 2013 sea­son, Hamil­ton has won 70 races, an av­er­age of nearly nine wins a year. In 1992, such a suc­cess rate was ex­tra­or­di­nary. It took Schu­macher 156 races to match what had taken Prost 193, Hamil­ton 261 to match what took Schu­macher 246. Such fig­ures de­mand pro­longed and re­lent­less suc­cess.</p>
    <p>I have never be­lieved that records should stand for­ever, not if a sport is to show health and vigour, and es­pe­cially given that, by def­i­ni­tion, vic­tory gets harder ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>Records are a sign of progress and great­ness.</p>
    <p>The ma­chines are ev­ery bit as im­por­tant, but the record break­ers are the men whose com­mit­ment and level of per­for­mance is im­pla­ca­ble and im­pec­ca­ble, who can not only win with the best car, but some­times with one that isn’t, or when the chips are down, the weather is foul, or they are un­der par health-wise. Such as when Ste­wart had an ul­cer in 1972, or Hamil­ton drove on Sun­day with cramp in his right calf which obliged him to lift off on the main straight in the clos­ing laps.</p>
    <p>As box­ing leg­end Jack Dempsey once re­marked, a true cham­pion isn’t just some­one who can win when things are good, but who gets up when they can’t. There are al­ways deep-ly­ing rea­sons why any record-break­ing driver – or team – is out­stand­ing.</p>
