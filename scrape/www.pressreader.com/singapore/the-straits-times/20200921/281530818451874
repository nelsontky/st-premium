    <p>The White Pa­per will aim to ad­dress women-re­lated is­sues that Sin­ga­pore­ans are con­cerned with. It will aim to be a fur­ther road map for progress, a path­way to­wards greater gen­der equal­ity.</p>
    <p>MIN­IS­TER FOR HOME AF­FAIRS AND LAW K. SHAN­MUGAM</p>
    <p>Through col­lec­tive ef­forts over the years, the po­si­tion of women in Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety has im­proved sig­nif­i­cantly in ar­eas such as ed­u­ca­tion, rep­re­sen­ta­tion in Par­lia­ment and con­tri­bu­tions to the econ­omy, said Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>Other ef­forts, he said, helped plug gaps in ar­eas that af­fected women – such as the Pe­nal Code amend­ments last year that specif­i­cally ad­dressed voyeurism, among other things, and the for­ma­tion of an in­ter-agency task force ear­lier this year to com­bat fam­ily vi­o­lence and pro­tect vic­tims.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are still ar­eas where the ad­vance­ment of women’s in­ter­ests is a “work in progress”, and part of the is­sue re­mains struc­tural, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam, in a speech yes­ter­day, an­nounced a com­pre­hen­sive re­view of is­sues af­fect­ing gen­der in­equal­ity that will cul­mi­nate in a White Pa­per to be de­liv­ered in the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>It is the con­tin­u­a­tion of a jour­ney that started many years ago, with a key point be­ing the pass­ing of the Women’s Char­ter in 1961 – be­fore Sin­ga­pore’s in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>The char­ter was land­mark leg­is­la­tion dur­ing its time, said Mr Shan­mugam, and it pro­vided for monog­a­mous mar­riage and the rights and du­ties of mar­ried per­sons at a time when polyg­a­mous mar­riage was com­mon­place.</p>
    <p>As the key piece of leg­is­la­tion gov­ern­ing women’s rights, the char­ter has been amended over the years, such as in 2016 and last year, to bet­ter sup­port vul­ner­a­ble women or girls in fam­ily vi­o­lence and cri­sis sit­u­a­tions, as well as strengthen law en­force­ment against on­line vice, he added.</p>
    <p>Other than the Women’s Char­ter, new laws have also been added to pro­tect women’s in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude amend­ments to the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code and Ev­i­dence Act in 2018 to re­duce trauma in­flicted on vic­tims dur­ing the crim­i­nal jus­tice process, and changes to the Pe­nal Code last year which re­pealed mar­i­tal im­mu­nity for rape, among other things.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Shan­mugam: “We also made the process eas­ier for women to lodge re­ports and ob­tain jus­tice.” One ex­am­ple, he added, was the es­tab­lish­ment of the OneSafe Cen­tre by the po­lice for vic­tims of sex­ual as­sault to un­dergo foren­sic and med­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tion in one place with greater pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>The Fam­ily Vi­o­lence Task­force, set up ear­lier this year, will com­plete its study and pro­vide rec­om­men­da­tions next year, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said women have done well in many sec­tors, such as medicine, law, ac­coun­tancy, fi­nance, and some as­pects of the knowl­edge econ­omy. “But there are ar­eas where it is still work in progress,” he added.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the Coun­cil for Board Di­ver­sity formed in 2014 to ad­dress the un­der-rep­re­sen­ta­tion of women in board po­si­tions, he said women on boards of the top 100 com­pa­nies on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change was 7.5 per cent in 2013.</p>
    <p>That in­creased to 16.2 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Part of the prob­lem, Mr Shan­mugam said, was struc­tural.</p>
    <p>He added that work­ing women are of­ten forced to make a choice be­tween work and fam­ily – a dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion that men sel­dom have to con­front.</p>
    <p>“We want women to be pre­sented with real choices, un­en­cum­bered by un­equal ex­pec­ta­tions on the roles of men and women in so­ci­ety,” he said.</p>
    <p>To help, the Gov­ern­ment has pro­moted flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments to give work­ing moth­ers more choices to re­main in the work­force, while bal­anc­ing fam­ily re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, he said.</p>
    <p>“Im­proved ac­ces­si­bil­ity and af­ford­abil­ity of in­fant care and child­care will help to give work­ing moth­ers more choices to re­main in the work­force, and peace of mind when they go to work.”</p>
    <p>In March last year, the bud­get to in­cen­tivise com­pa­nies to adopt flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments – called the Work-Life Grant – was in­creased from $30 mil­lion to $100 mil­lion, the min­is­ter noted.</p>
    <p>Still, Sin­ga­pore has done “fairly well”, he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that there were 28 women MPs in Par­lia­ment out of a to­tal of 95 seats – a pro­por­tion of about 29 per cent.</p>
    <p>“This is higher than the In­ter-Par­lia­men­tary Union’s world av­er­age of 24.5 per cent.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said: “The out­come of this process is not just a White Pa­per with rec­om­men­da­tions, but it has got to be a clear mes­sage to ev­ery young girl today, and in the fu­ture, that Sin­ga­pore will al­ways be a place where they can achieve their fullest po­ten­tial.”</p>
