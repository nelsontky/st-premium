    <p>Most people jazz up their</p>
    <p>Zoom calls th­ese days with im­pres­sive vir­tual back­drops to dis­guise the re­al­ity of their home of­fices.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can science-fic­tion writer Ernest</p>
    <p>Cline does not need to.</p>
    <p>He takes this re­porter’s call in his garage with his “time ma­chines” in the back­ground – two souped-up DeLorean cars that cross the Back To The Fu­ture se­ries with Ghostbuste­rs and Star Wars.</p>
    <p>Since the ex­plo­sive suc­cess of his 2011 vir­tual re­al­ity (VR) novel Ready Player One – which spent more than 100 weeks on the New York Times best­seller list – and its 2018 movie adap­ta­tion by Steven Spiel­berg, Cline is a geek liv­ing the dream.</p>
    <p>“I started to ques­tion if my own life was a sim­u­la­tion,” says the 48-year-old, “be­cause I couldn’t be­lieve how great things were go­ing. But it re­ally was real.”</p>
    <p>Nine years later, he re­turns to his old stomp­ing ground with Ready Player Two, i n which the VR tech­nol­ogy of his de­but novel gets a stag­ger­ing up­grade. A film adap­ta­tion by Warner Bros is al­ready in the early stages.</p>
    <p>Cline says he al­ways en­vi­sioned a tril­ogy of books, but only got around to writ­ing a se­quel in the past three years – i n be­tween writ­ing his sec­ond novel, Ar­mada (2015), and do­ing pub­lic­ity for Spiel­berg’s film.</p>
    <p>Spiel­berg – the leg­endary direc­tor of Jaws (1975), the In­di­ana</p>
    <p>Jones fran­chise (1981 to 2008) and the first two Juras­sic Park films (1993 and 1997) – read early drafts of Ready Player Two and gave Cline feed­back.</p>
    <p>“When you meet Steven Spiel­berg, it’s like the big­gest day of your life,” says Cline, who grew up with the direc­tor’s films. “But he’s very good at set­ting people at ease and just a won­der­ful per­son to be around.”</p>
    <p>Spiel­berg re­port­edly car­ried around a dog-eared paperback copy of Ready Player One and would send photos of its pages to other screen­writ­ers.</p>
    <p>“It just made me so grate­ful that I wrote a story that some­how res­onated with one of the people who in­spired me to write it,” says Cline.</p>
    <p>In Ready Player One, which is set in a dystopian fu­ture be­set by se­vere global warm­ing and so­cioe­co­nomic in­equal­ity, people seek an es­cape from the real world in the VR uni­verse Oa­sis.</p>
    <p>When Oa­sis’ cre­ator James Hal­l­i­day dies, he leaves be­hind a se­ries of clues lead­ing to an Easter Egg which will grant its finder con­trol of the Oa­sis. The clues draw on Hal­l­i­day’s pas­sions for video games, science fic­tion, fan­tasy and pop cul­ture from the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Wade Watts, a teenager from the slums, finds the Egg, and he and his al­lies be­come the own­ers of the Oa­sis.</p>
    <p>Ready Player Two picks up where Ready Player One ended, with Wade dis­cov­er­ing Hal­l­i­day has left him a new tech­nol­ogy, ONI (Oa­sis Neu­ral In­ter­face), a brain­com­puter in­ter­face that makes the VR ex­pe­ri­ence prac­ti­cally in­dis­tin­guish­able from real life.</p>
    <p>Against the ob­jec­tions of his girl­friend Sa­man­tha, Wade re­leases ONI to the world – and ev­ery­one is in­stantly hooked.</p>
    <p>In the years since Ready Player One was pub­lished, Cline has watched social me­dia go from in­choate to om­nipresent.</p>
    <p>“A lot of us al­ready have our brains plugged in to the In­ter­net all the time,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I think that social me­dia has be­come even more im­por­tant, es­pe­cially dur­ing the pan­demic, as a way for people to reach out and con­nect to other people.</p>
    <p>“But I do think it’s de­signed to be ad­dic­tive, to make you not want to log off and to give you a dopamine rush in your brain when other people are lik­ing your posts. It’s only now, 10 or 15 years af­ter th­ese plat­forms have been in­vented, that we are start­ing to see their so­ci­o­log­i­cal and po­lit­i­cal ram­i­fi­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>In Ready Player Two, a rogue avatar seizes con­trol of ONI and locks nearly half a bil­lion users in the Oa­sis. Wade and his team have to em­bark on a quest per­tain­ing to the late Kira Un­der­wood, Hal­l­i­day’s col­lab­o­ra­tor on whom he had a crush, be­fore all the users end up brain dead from spend­ing too long in the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The quest in­cludes in­fil­trat­ing John Hughes’ high school films, re-en­act­ing J.R.R. Tolkien’s fan­tasy book The Sil­mar­il­lion and fight­ing seven in­car­na­tions of the late mu­sic icon Prince. Cline says the Prince se­quence was his favourite to write.</p>
    <p>He de­scribes his in­ven­tions as “al­most a self-ful­fill­ing prophecy” – com­mer­cial VR head­sets came on the mar­ket about five years af­ter his de­but was pub­lished. One pro­ducer, Ocu­lus VR, was said to hand out copies of Ready Player One to new em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“They told me that their busi­ness model was to make Ready Player One a re­al­ity,” says Cline, “and they did it.”</p>
    <p>He is less thrilled about hav­ing imag­ined a sit­u­a­tion where the real world is so dire that people have to re­treat into VR. In Ready Player One, a flu pan­demic is one of the nat­u­ral dis­as­ters that be­fall the world, killing Sa­man­tha’s par­ents.</p>
    <p>“I did not fore­see any of this hap­pen­ing this quickly,” says Cline of the Covid-19 out­break, “or the way that it has driven ev­ery­body on­line and forced people to use Zoom and vir­tual re­al­ity to com­mu­ni­cate.”</p>
    <p>He is mar­ried with two daugh­ters, aged 13 and 21/ 2.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want the dystopian fu­ture I de­pict my nov­els to come true. In my coun­try, a lot of people don’t take cli­mate change se­ri­ously, even though half of our coun­try catches fire ev­ery year dur­ing the dry sea­son,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I want people to have fun while they’re read­ing my sto­ries, but I also want them to think about the im­pli­ca­tions of cli­mate change and our tech­nol­ogy, and the kind of world we’re go­ing to leave for our kids to grow up in.”</p>
    <p>He ex­pects his next novel to be the one he has nick­named Ready Player Zero, the com­ing-of-age story of Hal­l­i­day, Kira and her fu­ture hus­band Og­den Mor­row. It will be heav­ily based on his own youth in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
    <p>“It was hard to be a geek then,” he says. “This was be­fore the In­ter­net rose up and the geeks in­her­ited the earth.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing able to share my love of pop cul­ture with other geeks gave me a sec­ondary fam­ily that re­ally saved me when I was a young per­son and kept me from look­ing for an es­cape through other ways. I was able to find that es­cape in my imag­i­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ready Player One ($17.95) and Ready Player Two ($30.54) are avail­able at ma­jor book­stores.</p>
