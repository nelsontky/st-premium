    <p>LAKE CHARLES • United States Pres­i­dent Donald Trump has sur­veyed dam­age in Louisiana and Texas from Hur­ri­cane Laura, which slammed into the Gulf Coast as a Cat­e­gory Four storm two days ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on Saturday met first re­spon­ders, mem­bers of the Na­tional Guard, city of­fi­cials and Con­gress mem­bers in Lake Charles, Louisiana, dur­ing about two hours there.</p>
    <p>With his en­tourage, he walked – mask­less – through a neigh­bour­hood lit­tered with da­m­aged houses, downed trees and top­pled power lines.</p>
    <p>He later trav­elled on to nearby Or­ange, Texas, via he­li­copter, to in­spect con­di­tions from the air and ground.</p>
    <p>“I’m here to sup­port the great peo­ple of Louisiana,” Mr Trump said in re­marks at the Lake Charles Fire Depart­ment. “This was a tremen­dously pow­er­ful storm.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent said that Louisiana has “been through a lot”, be­tween the mas­sive hur­ri­cane and its Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“You’ve done a great job,” he told Mr John Bel Ed­wards, the state’s Demo­cratic gover­nor.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­wards said Laura was the most pow­er­ful hur­ri­cane to strike the state.</p>
    <p>Hur­ri­cane Ka­t­rina hit 15 years ago as a Cat­e­gory Three storm, dev­as­tat­ing New Or­leans and killing over 1,800 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump noted that many res­i­dents were with­out power and there­fore also with­out air-con­di­tion­ing, with tem­per­a­tures and hu­mid­ity climb­ing.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple get used to air con­di­tion­ing and all of a sud­den they don’t have it, that’s a very trau­matic sit­u­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Emer­gency Man­age­ment Agency has so far de­liv­ered some 2.6 mil­lion litres of wa­ter and 1.4 mil­lion meals to res­i­dents dis­placed by the storm, Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>In Or­ange, he vis­ited the county’s emer­gency oper­a­tions cen­tre for an up­date on the govern­ment re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Laura made land­fall last Thurs­day morn­ing, pack­ing winds of 241kmh, some of the strong­est to hit the re­gion in more than a cen­tury. The death toll in Louisiana and Texas is at least 16, the As­so­ci­ated Press re­ported.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of thou­sands of res­i­dents are still with­out wa­ter and power.</p>
    <p>The storm’s track shifted east at the last mo­ment to strike the re­gion vis­ited by Mr Trump, along the border be­tween the two states, while spar­ing nearby oil re­finer­ies.</p>
    <p>A chem­i­cal fire that broke out in Lake Charles at a KIK Cus­tom Prod­ucts-owned BioLab fa­cil­ity is now un­der con­trol.</p>
