    <p>Where: 01-15A The Grand­stand, 200 Turf Club Road; open: 10am to 8.30pm daily</p>
    <p>Info: www.ev­ery­dayve­g­an­gro­cer.com</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic hit, Ev­ery­day Ve­gan Gro­cer founder Amanda Teng used her blog to fo­cus on ve­gan fash­ion and life­style prod­ucts, which she sold at mar­kets and fairs.</p>
    <p>In March last year, she piv­oted to sell­ing gro­ceries on­line as well, by part­ner­ing lo­cal or­ganic farms and home-grown ve­gan food mak­ers such as Kroodi, Mekhala and Kind Kones.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pan­demic, as su­per­mar­ket shelves were be­ing wiped out is­land­wide, do­ing on­line gro­cery de­liv­er­ies helped to sus­tain her busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber, Ms Teng, who has been ve­gan for 11 years, opened Ev­ery­day Ve­gan Gro­cer at The Grand­stand, com­plete with a small seat­ing area for cus­tomers to re­lax with or­ganic and fair-trade cof­fee and tea (with oat, soya or al­mond milk) and ve­gan cakes.</p>
    <p>She has a strict se­lec­tion cri­te­ria for gro­ceries. All plant-based prod­ucts she stocks have to be cru­el­tyfree – not tested on an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>“Plus points are given to prod­ucts that are fair/di­rect-trade and or­ganic – which are bet­ter for farm­ers and the en­vi­ron­ment – as well as free of palm oil, which is a big con­trib­u­tor to de­for­esta­tion and habi­tat loss,” she says.</p>
    <p>The 1,315 sq ft shop is stocked with snacks, drinks, plant-based milk and “meat”, as well as condi­ments. High­lights in­clude Solkiki’s ar­ti­sanal white, dark and milk choco­lates ($14) from Bri­tain; ve­gan cheese by Ve­gusto ($16.60) from Switzer­land and Green Vie (from $11.60) from Cyprus; and Wrappa ve­gan food wraps ($35 for a pack of three) from Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>To re­duce plas­tic waste, the gro­cer op­er­ates on a strict bring-your-own-bag pol­icy. You can also “rent” one for $1 and re­turn it on the next visit.</p>
    <p>Ms Teng says: “While I un­der­stand that the lo­cal su­per­mar­ket and gro­cery in­dus­try can­not move to­wards plant-based-only op­tions, I would like to see gro­cery stores work­ing to­wards models that cham­pion sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“We have an hon­our sys­tem where cus­tomers ex­change bags with us with each or­der. It was a big gam­ble at the start for a small busi­ness like ours, but it has worked very well.”</p>
