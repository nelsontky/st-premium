    <p>• Andy Mur­ray ex­pects some of the top male ten­nis play­ers to fol­low women’s world No. 1 Ash­leigh Barty in skip­ping the US Open later this month, due to con­cerns over the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Barty said on Thurs­day she was not com­fort­able trav­el­ling to the United States for the hard-court Grand Slam, which is sched­uled to start in New York on Aug 31, amid the cur­rent con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Scot­land’s Mur­ray be­lieves oth­ers will take the same stance.</p>
    <p>“I have heard some of the top male play­ers aren’t go­ing to play. I would ex­pect that would be the case,” the for­mer men’s world No. 1 told Bri­tish me­dia.</p>
    <p>“It’s ev­ery­one’s per­sonal de­ci­sion. If they don’t feel safe, and don’t feel com­fort­able, trav­el­ling and go­ing there and putting them­selves and their team at an in­creased risk, then it’s com­pletely un­der­stand­able.”</p>
    <p>The top-ranked No­vak Djokovic, world No. 2 Rafael Nadal and 23-time women’s sin­gles Grand Slam cham­pion Ser­ena Wil­liams have all en­tered the Aug 20-28 Western & South­ern Open in New York, which will serve as a tune-up for the US Open.</p>
    <p>Both tour­na­ments will be played with­out fans in at­ten­dance, with or­gan­is­ers United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion set­ting up a strict bio-se­cu­rity “bub­ble” to min­imise the risk of con­tract­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>That in­cludes re­strict­ing play­ers to their ho­tel when not play­ing and re­strict­ing the size of their en­tourage.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite all the en­hanced safety mea­sures, Mur­ray feels some of his peers will still err on the side of cau­tion.</p>
    <p>“All of the play­ers will have some reser­va­tions and it’s whether or not you feel com­fort­able tak­ing that risk,” added the three-time Ma­jor win­ner, who is also gear­ing up to play at Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>“My feel­ing is once we are in­side that bub­ble they cre­ated, we will be okay.</p>
    <p>“It’s more the in­ter­na­tional travel and get­ting there, which I will be a bit con­cerned about it.”</p>
    <p>The ten­nis sea­son has been on ice since March ow­ing to the pan­demic, al­though the WTA Tour will re­sume play with the Palermo event in Italy start­ing Mon­day.</p>
    <p>That tour­na­ment will be held be­hind closed doors, and it is likely to be the same at the WTA and ATP Tour’s Ital­ian Open, which is set for Sept 20-27.</p>
    <p>La Repub­blica news­pa­per said on Thurs­day that the Italy gov­ern­ment’s tech­ni­cal sci­en­tific com­mit­tee re­jected the Ital­ian Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion’s guide­lines as un­suit­able to pre­vent the risks of con­ta­gion if fans are al­lowed to at­tend the clay­court event. Or­gan­is­ers re­main hope­ful of strik­ing a com­pro­mise.</p>
