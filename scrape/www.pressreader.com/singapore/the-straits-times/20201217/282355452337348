    <p>Lo­cal in­vestors took their cue from rises on Wall Street overnight on the back of vac­cine ad­vances and stim­u­lus talks to send shares higher yes­ter­day. The im­proved sen­ti­ment sent the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) up 16.08 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 2,872.80, with gain­ers pip­ping losers 268 to 163 on trade of 2.29 bil­lion shares worth $1.25 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Talk of vac­cines con­tin­ued to fuel in­vestor op­ti­mism, but some ex­perts have flagged the need to be cau­tious as the Covid-19 pan­demic is still up­end­ing cer­tain coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Axi strate­gist Stephen Innes noted that there are chances of ex­tended lock­downs in sev­eral coun­tries, and this had not nec­es­sar­ily been priced in by mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“There is a gap to be bridged be­tween now and when ex­perts ex­pect herd im­mu­nity – in the mid­dle of the sec­ond quar­ter at the ear­li­est... It is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly likely that we will see ex­tended lock­downs for most of the first quar­ter.”</p>
    <p>Wall Street was still fo­cused on the pos­i­tive, with all in­dexes end­ing up about 1.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ven­ture Cor­po­ra­tion was the big­gest ad­vancer on the lo­cal mar­ket, gain­ing 4.3 per cent to $19.52.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore added 4.1 per cent to finish at 89 cents. May­bank Kim Eng raised its tar­get price af­ter an­a­lysts noted that Sin­ga­pore’s phase three re­open­ing will be pos­i­tive for the re­sort op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>The banks were also among the top gain­ers. DBS added 0.4 per cent to $25.56, United Over­seas Bank gained 0.4 per cent to $22.99, while OCBC rose 1.2 per cent to $10.23.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings and Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings were the big­gest losers, re­vers­ing their gains on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets mostly fin­ished higher. Malaysia ad­vanced 0.4 per cent, Jakarta gained 1.8 per cent and the Hang Seng rose 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>• Big­gest losers: Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings, Jar­dine Mathe­son</p>
