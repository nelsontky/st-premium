    <p>In­dia’s cen­tral bank has pro­posed a scheme to merge the ail­ing Lak­shmi Vi­las Bank with DBS Bank.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed plan would give the Sin­ga­pore-based bank a fil­lip as it would vastly in­crease the foot­print of DBS in In­dia. But some an­a­lysts have raised con­cerns about prof­itabil­ity in the medium term.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s cen­tral bank has pro­posed a scheme to merge the ail­ing Lak­shmi Vi­las Bank (LVB) with DBS Bank.</p>
    <p>The move would in­volve DBS, South-east Asia’s big­gest bank, in­ject­ing 25 bil­lion rupees (S$452 mil­lion) of fresh cap­i­tal into its wholly owned In­dia sub­sidiary DBS Bank In­dia.</p>
    <p>Chennai-based LVB has been strug­gling with fi­nan­cial de­cline and red ink for the past three years.</p>
    <p>It in­curred a loss of around $150 mil­lion in the 12 months to March 31. Its net worth has also shrunk while un­paid loans have in­creased.</p>
    <p>LVB is the fourth In­dian bank to have had a near-death ex­pe­ri­ence in the past two years, forc­ing the cen­tral bank to bail them out.</p>
    <p>“LVB, like many pri­vate sec­tor banks, is full of anachro­nisms. Based in small towns, it couldn’t at­tract enough good tal­ent,” said Mr Amit Tan­don, founder of In­sti­tu­tional In­vestor Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“It didn’t mod­ernise fast enough... its old hands didn’t step down as di­rec­tors to in­fuse fresh cap­i­tal and ideas even as the bank de­te­ri­o­rated.”</p>
    <p>In­dia’s cen­tral bank ad­vised LVB in Septem­ber last year to re­duce bad as­sets and bring in new cap­i­tal. A string of in­vestors showed in­ter­est, in­clud­ing SREI Cap­i­tal, In­di­a­b­ulls Hous­ing and, most re­cently, Clix Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“Dis­cus­sions dragged on for months, es­pe­cially with Clix. LVB’s in­abil­ity to get its arms around any of the in­vestors was a telling sign that things weren’t okay. That’s why the cen­tral bank stepped in,” said Mr Tan­don.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank im­posed a onemonth mora­to­rium on LVB on Tues­day, capped de­posit with­drawals at 25,000 rupees and un­veiled the pro­posed merger with DBS soon after.</p>
    <p>LVB’s share price has crashed with its eroded net worth and share­hold­ers will be writ­ten off with­out a stake in the new en­tity, but the cen­tral bank has re­peat­edly as­sured de­pos­i­tors that their in­ter­ests will be pro­tected.</p>
    <p>The merger might be broadly pos­i­tive for DBS, bank­ing an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>It has been in In­dia since 1994 and con­verted its op­er­a­tions into a wholly owned sub­sidiary DBS In­dia that was in­cor­po­rated in March last year.</p>
    <p>“DBS has since wanted to build its port­fo­lio of low-cost li­a­bil­i­ties and lend to small and medium en­ter­prises. These two driv­ers will ben­e­fit if DBS ac­quires LVB,” said a banker who did not want to be named.</p>
    <p>De­spite the size of LVB’s non­per­form­ing as­sets, a merger would give DBS a valu­able cus­tomer base and a size­able branch net­work in In­dia.</p>
    <p>DBS has only around 30 branches in In­dia, but could gain LVB’s over 560 branches and 970 ATMs across the coun­try, es­pe­cially in Tamil Nadu.</p>
    <p>LVB has over 210 bil­lion rupees in de­posits as at Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>DBS Sin­ga­pore said the pro­posed amal­ga­ma­tion would pro­vide “sta­bil­ity and bet­ter prospects” to LVB’s cus­tomers and em­ploy­ees fol­low­ing a time of un­cer­tainty. It would also al­low DBS In­dia “to scale its cus­tomer base and net­work, par­tic­u­larly in South</p>
    <p>In­dia, which has long­stand­ing and close busi­ness ties with Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>It is await­ing con­fir­ma­tion from the In­dian cen­tral bank.</p>
    <p>DBS has a his­tory of mov­ing into other ter­ri­to­ries like Hong Kong and Tai­wan through sim­i­lar ac­qui­si­tions of large banks.</p>
    <p>“How it will work in In­dia, only time will tell. The key chal­lenge will be in­te­gra­tion of the two banks, es­pe­cially given LVB’s large unionised staff and other sys­temic is­sues,” said the banker.</p>
