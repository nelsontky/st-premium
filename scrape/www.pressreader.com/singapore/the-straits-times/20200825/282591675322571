    <p>Paris Hilton’s new doc­u­men­tary, This Is Paris, will be pre­mier­ing on her YouTube chan­nel on Sept 14. In it, the 39-year-old me­dia per­son­al­ity talks about the al­leged abuse she suf­fered at the hands of board­ing school staff as a teenager, Peo­ple mag­a­zine re­ports.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Peo­ple, Hilton talked about her ex­pe­ri­ences at Provo Canyon School, a board­ing school in Utah she at­tended in the late 1990s. She said: “Peo­ple might as­sume ev­ery­thing in my life came easy to me, but I want to show the world who I truly am.”</p>
    <p>The Sim­ple Life (2003) star said that be­fore at­tend­ing board­ing school, she had been liv­ing in New York’s Wal­dorf As­to­ria Ho­tel with her par­ents and her three sib­lings, sis­ter Nicky and broth­ers Bar­ron and Con­rad.</p>
    <p>On her teenage years, she re­called: “It was so easy to sneak out and go to clubs and par­ties. My par­ents were so strict that it made me want to rebel. They’d (pun­ish me) by tak­ing away my cell­phone, tak­ing away my credit card, but it didn’t work.”</p>
    <p>Hilton, then 17, would still go out. Her par­ents, busi­ness­man Richard Hilton and ac­tress and so­cialite Kathy Hilton de­cided to send her to Provo Canyon School, where she re­mained for 11 months.</p>
    <p>In 1998, Hilton’s first im­pres­sions of the school were hardly stel­lar: “It was sup­posed to be a school, but (classes) were not the fo­cus at all. It was all day scream­ing in my face, yelling at me, con­tin­u­ous tor­ture.”</p>
    <p>She con­tin­ued: “The staff would say ter­ri­ble things. They were con­stantly making me feel bad about my­self and bul­ly­ing me. I think it was their goal to break us down. They were phys­i­cally abu­sive, hit­ting and stran­gling us. They wanted to in­stil fear in the kids.”</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence had a pro­found im­pact on Hilton’s men­tal health: “I was hav­ing panic at­tacks and cry­ing every sin­gle day. I was just so mis­er­able. I felt like a pris­oner and I hated life.”</p>
    <p>By open­ing up about her ex­pe­ri­ence, she hopes to con­front her past and move on, as well as to raise aware­ness of other so-called be­hav­iour im­prove­ment schools</p>
    <p>When asked by Peo­ple to com­ment on the al­le­ga­tions, the school re­sponded: “Orig­i­nally opened in 1971, Provo Canyon School was sold by its pre­vi­ous own­er­ship in Au­gust 2000. We there­fore can­not com­ment on the op­er­a­tions or pa­tient ex­pe­ri­ence prior to this time.”</p>
