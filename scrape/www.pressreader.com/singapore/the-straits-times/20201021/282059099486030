    <p>A 29-year-old man who was al­legedly in­volved in the fa­tal brawl at Or­chard Tow­ers in July last year will be tried in the High Court, said the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tan Sen Yang, who faces a mur­der charge, is ac­cused of caus­ing the death of Mr Satheesh Noel Go­bidass, 31, with a karam­bit knife.</p>
    <p>His case was moved to the High Court yes­ter­day, said the AGC.</p>
    <p>The AGC also clar­i­fied its de­ci­sion to re­duce the charges for the six other in­di­vid­u­als who were in­volved in the in­ci­dent. They were ini­tially charged with mur­der.</p>
    <p>The six are: Chan Jia Xing, 27; Tan Hong Sheng, 23; Natalie Siow Yu Zhen, 24; Joel Tan Yun Sheng, 27; Ang Da Yuan, 27; and Loo Boon Chong, 27.</p>
    <p>The group of seven were leav­ing Naughty Girl Club in Or­chard Tow­ers at around 6.20am on July 2 last year when they got into a dis­pute with an­other group.</p>
    <p>Mr Satheesh was killed af­ter he con­fronted one of the seven who, along with other mem­bers of the group, at­tacked him.</p>
    <p>The brawl was cap­tured by cam­eras out­side a shop on the first floor of the build­ing. Closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage showed Mr Satheesh ex­chang­ing blows with some peo­ple be­fore stum­bling to the ground.</p>
    <p>He was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal and died at 7.25am.</p>
    <p>Af­ter in­ves­ti­ga­tions, the AGC found that six of the in­di­vid­u­als were not in­volved in caus­ing Mr Satheesh’s death. The charges against them were then re­duced.</p>
    <p>The AGC said yes­ter­day that Tan Sen Yang, Ang, Siow and Joel Tan got into a fight with Mr Satheesh.</p>
    <p>Tan Sen Yang al­legedly slashed at him with his knife sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, Loo and Tan Hong Sheng were not in­volved in the brawl or had tried to stop it, the AGC said.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Mr Chan was given a 12-month con­di­tional warn­ing af­ter his charge was re­duced to con­sort­ing with a per­son car­ry­ing an of­fen­sive weapon in a pub­lic place.</p>
    <p>The AGC said the crime Mr Chan was charged with took into ac­count his in­volve­ment, how he tried to stop the at­tack and his co­op­er­a­tion with po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions. He could re­turn to court if he re­of­fends within a 12-month pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A con­di­tional warn­ing does not amount to a con­vic­tion or a find­ing of guilt, and does not leave a crim­i­nal record, mean­ing he will face no fur­ther ac­tion if he does not com­mit any crimes for a year.</p>
    <p>Joel Tan, Ang and Siow had ear­lier this year pleaded guilty to as­sault charges, among other things.</p>
    <p>The AGC said their acts re­sulted in two abra­sions on Mr Satheesh’s up­per body, which were mi­nor and non-fa­tal in na­ture.</p>
    <p>“There was in­suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to show that they in­tended to cause more than sim­ple hurt. As such, charges of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt with com­mon in­ten­tion were pro­ceeded against them,” the AGC said.</p>
    <p>Joel Tan was sen­tenced to one month’s jail. Ang was sen­tenced to eight months’ jail and six strokes of the cane. Siow was given five months’ jail in ad­di­tion to the 3½ months she had ear­lier spent in re­mand. Tan Hong Sheng and Loo have not been sen­tenced yet.</p>
