    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Work off ex­cess en­ergy with some­thing that makes you sweat. It is a great way to stay in shape and keep mov­ing in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Try not to just roll over when peo­ple get pushy, even if the last thing you want is a power strug­gle. Fight back so they know where you stand.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your ac­tions may con­found the boss or some­one who can make de­ci­sions, but they should make these peo­ple in­clined to trust you.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Think about the rest of the year, not just the short term. It is easy to get caught up in the moment, es­pe­cially when weird news strikes.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You achieve some­thing big, so make the most of it. See if you can get your­self to shake things up in a new way.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your need to help oth­ers is a driv­ing force, so make sure you in­dulge it or you may find your­self over­whelmed by emo­tions.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>So­cial ac­tiv­ity is vi­tal. For­tu­nately, lots of peo­ple feel the same way you do, so get out there and mix it up.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You are fac­ing a se­ri­ous chal­lenge, so step up and look it in the face. Your en­ergy feels spent, but you can han­dle it.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your so­cial en­ergy is a po­tent force and it should help you spread the word. Make the most of this boost with a ro­man­tic move.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are harp­ing about things that should not be your prob­lem. You can­not ig­nore them, but do not give them ex­tra at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Events are afoot that are sure to shake up your life in a deep way. Stop to take it all in – this should make for a great story.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Let other peo­ple deal with their own drama. But you can in­dulge them with­out ac­tively in­volv­ing your­self in their crazi­ness.</p>
