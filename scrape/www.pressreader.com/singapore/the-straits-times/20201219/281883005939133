    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States’ mil­i­tary warned on Thurs­day that its war­ships would be “more as­sertive” in re­spond­ing to vi­o­la­tions of in­ter­na­tional law, cit­ing in par­tic­u­lar Bei­jing, which has ex­pan­sion­ist am­bi­tions in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>In a doc­u­ment set­ting ob­jec­tives for the US Navy, Marines and Coast Guard for the com­ing years, the Pen­tagon stressed that sev­eral coun­tries, no­tably Rus­sia and China, “are con­test­ing the bal­ance of power in key re­gions and seek­ing to un­der­mine the ex­ist­ing world or­der”.</p>
    <p>“Our glob­ally de­ployed naval forces in­ter­act with Chi­nese and Rus­sian war­ships and air­craft daily,” the doc­u­ment said, not­ing their “grow­ing ag­gres­sive­ness” and call­ing China “the most press­ing, long-term strate­gic threat”.</p>
    <p>The lat­est in­ci­dent be­tween the US and Chi­nese naval forces took place in late Au­gust, when Bei­jing said it had driven an Amer­i­can war­ship from the dis­puted Para­cel ar­chi­pel­ago.</p>
    <p>The Asian power claims al­most all of the is­lands of the South China Sea, ter­ri­to­rial claims dis­puted by other coun­tries in the re­gion in­clud­ing Viet­nam, Malaysia, the Philip­pines and Brunei. To counter China, the US has been send­ing ships to the re­gion more fre­quently to carry out what it calls “free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion” op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>To main­tain strate­gic ad­van­tage over the Chi­nese navy whose “bat­tle force has more than tripled in size in only two decades”, the US Navy plans to mod­ernise with smaller, more ag­ile and even re­motely pi­loted ships. US ships will also “ac­cept cal­cu­lated tac­ti­cal risks and adopt a more as­sertive pos­ture in our day-to-day op­er­a­tions”, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>For Navy Rear Ad­mi­ral Jay Bynum, that means be­ing “more re­spon­sive, more as­sertive”.</p>
    <p>“In the past, our be­hav­iour was de-es­ca­la­tion. We would turn away and min­imise risk in those in­di­vid­ual con­tacts,” he said, not­ing that the navy “might be ced­ing ground” with the ap­proach.</p>
    <p>The Pen­tagon doc­u­ment spec­i­fied that the US Navy will also be more vis­i­ble in the Pa­cific, where it will “de­tect and doc­u­ment our ri­vals’ ac­tions that vi­o­late in­ter­na­tional law, steal re­sources and in­fringe upon the sovereignt­y of other na­tions”.</p>
