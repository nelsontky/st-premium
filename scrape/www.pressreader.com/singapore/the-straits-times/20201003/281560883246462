    <p>Twelve peo­ple were charged in a district court yes­ter­day af­ter they al­legedly flouted safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and took part in an un­law­ful gath­er­ing on Lazarus Is­land amid the Covid-19 out­break on Aug 8. All of them were charged with an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>Among the 12 charged are (from left) Singaporea­n Natalie Joanna Sarkies and Bri­tons Zoe Louise Cronk, James Riby Oram Trim­ming, Richard Henri Lagesse, Ed­ward John Joseph Lee-Bull, and Paul Jonathon Gold.</p>
    <p>Twelve peo­ple were charged in a district court yes­ter­day af­ter they al­legedly flouted safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and took part in an un­law­ful gath­er­ing on Lazarus Is­land amid the Covid-19 out­break on Aug 8.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, the event took place be­tween 11am and 6pm that day.</p>
    <p>The 12 are said to have vi­o­lated Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions which pro­hibit so­cial gath­er­ings of more than five peo­ple who do not stay in the same place of res­i­dence. All of them were charged with an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>They are: Natalie Joanna Sarkies, 29; He­len Ann Sul­li­van, 30; Zoe Louise Cronk, 30; Jeff Richard Alexan­der, 31; Joshua Adam Roth, 31; Lowri Mair Jeffs, 31; James Riby Oram Trim­ming, 31; Richard Henri Lagesse, 31; Luong Thi Thu Ha, 31; Wil­liam Ed­win Dun­ford, 32, Ed­ward John Joseph Lee-Bull, 32, and Paul Jonathon Gold, 32.</p>
    <p>All of them are Bri­tish ex­cept Sarkies, who is Singaporea­n, and Ha, who is Viet­namese. Yes­ter­day, the court heard that Ha has also been a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent for 11 years. Gold in­tends to plead guilty to the of­fence and he will be back in court on Oct 14. The cases in­volv­ing the re­main­ing 11 have been ad­journed to Oct 23.</p>
    <p>Lazarus Is­land is lo­cated south of the Sin­ga­pore main­land and a man­made cause­way con­nects it to St John’s Is­land.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity, which man­ages it, had said in an ear­lier state­ment that the Gov­ern­ment takes a se­ri­ous view of vi­o­la­tions of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The rule of five for so­cial gath­er­ings kicked in as Sin­ga­pore entered phase two of its re­open­ing on June 19.</p>
    <p>If found guilty of the of­fence un­der the Act, first-time of­fend­ers can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. Re­peat of­fend­ers can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
