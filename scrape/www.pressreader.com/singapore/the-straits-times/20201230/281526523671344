    <p>Stu­dents will be given more time in the first few weeks of next month to buy school uni­forms, said the Min­istry of Education (MOE) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Schools, which re­open from next Mon­day, will work closely with their ven­dors to en­sure that stu­dents can buy their uni­forms as soon as pos­si­ble, and fa­cil­i­tate the sale of uni­forms in school, MOE told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>MOE’s re­sponse comes after an in­ci­dent ear­lier i n the day in which the po­lice had to dis­perse a crowd which had gath­ered out­side a uni­form shop in Ang Mo Kio.</p>
    <p>The crowd com­prised par­ents who were try­ing to buy or ex­change school uni­forms for their chil­dren be­fore school starts next week. Many were not prac­tis­ing safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>MOE said that due to Covid-19, schools were ad­vised to make ad­just­ments to their year-end school ac­tiv­i­ties to safe­guard the health</p>
    <p>of the school com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded ask­ing schools to work with ven­dors to allow par­ents to buy their chil­dren’s uni­forms and books on­line, and to pro­vide home de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Ven­dors could also allow par­ents to make ap­point­ments to buy uni­forms in schools or at their own phys­i­cal stores.</p>
    <p>“MOE and schools un­der­stand the chal­lenges faced by par­ents and ven­dors,” said the min­istry, adding that schools will also make ar­range­ments for stu­dents who are un­able to buy their uni­forms in time for the start of the school term.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes al­low­ing them to re­port in their phys­i­cal education at­tire or pri­mary school uni­forms.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, par­ents and their chil­dren were at the Jeep Sing Fash­ion store around 8am, two hours be­fore it opened, for a queue ticket to buy school uni­forms.</p>
    <p>By around 10am, more than 100 peo­ple had formed a snaking queue to get into the shop lo­cated at Block 4012 Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 10, with some ig­nor­ing the 1m safe dis­tanc­ing rule.</p>
    <p>Six po­lice of­fi­cers were seen out­side the uni­form shop, urg­ing par­ents to stand far­ther apart and en­cour­ag­ing some to leave.</p>
    <p>On its web­site, the shop told cus­tomers not to turn up as all queue tick­ets for the day had been is­sued.</p>
    <p>Madam Sharon Yee, 33, could not get a queue ticket to buy a uni­form for her son, who will be start­ing se­condary school, even though she was at the store at 8.55am.</p>
    <p>Se­condary 1 post­ing re­sults were re­leased on Dec 22.</p>
    <p>“My son can’t wear his pri­mary school uni­form for the first few days of Se­condary 1 be­cause he has out­grown it. He might feel em­bar­rassed that he doesn’t have a uni­form when his friends have theirs,” said the civil ser­vant.</p>
    <p>Some par­ents also said they did not or­der uni­forms on­line as the de­liv­ery time, which could ex­ceed a week, was too long.</p>
    <p>Jeep Sing Fash­ion de­clined com­ment when con­tacted. Yes­ter­day, it apol­o­gised to cus­tomers on Face­book for the long queues and de­lay in or­ders, adding: “In view of Covid-19, we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a mas­sive surge in de­mand for our uni­forms in terms of phys­i­cal and e-com­merce or­ders.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice also cleared crowds of par­ents twice last week at school uni­form shop Bibi & Baba in Far East Shop­ping Cen­tre, said the store’s busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­ager Nick Koh.</p>
    <p>One pos­si­ble rea­son for the queues was that about half of the se­condary schools Bibi & Baba sup­plies uni­forms to did not allow the store to sell them on the schools’ premises due to Covid-19 con­cerns, said Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>Queues were more or­derly at Bibi & Baba yes­ter­day and staff were seen re­mind­ing cus­tomers in line to fol­low safe dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
