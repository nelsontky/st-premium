    <p>In­clu­sive hir­ing may have taken a back seat for some em­ploy­ers dur­ing the cur­rent pan­demic, mak­ing it harder for peo­ple with disabiliti­es who – like other Sin­ga­pore­ans – have had trou­ble se­cur­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment and var­i­ous agen­cies will con­tinue to help them find train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and em­ploy­ment, such as by mov­ing phys­i­cal lessons into on­line mod­ules and pro­vid­ing more train­ing al­lowances and grants, said Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Min­is­ter-in-charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion Desmond Lee yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said that dur­ing this pe­riod, vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple with disabiliti­es and their care­givers face ad­di­tional stres­sors. Hence, ini­tia­tives have been put in place to help them, whether through meals, tem­po­rary respite or fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>“But jobs re­main top of mind for us. How do we help em­ploy­ers adapt, and con­tinue to hire and train per­sons with disabiliti­es, in a largely re­mote work­ing en­vi­ron­ment?” said Mr Lee, who was the Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment be­fore the re­cent Cab­i­net reshuf­fle.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at the In­clu­sive Busi­ness Fo­rum, a bi­en­nial event or­gan­ised by SG En­able to pro­mote dis­abil­ity-in­clu­sive hir­ing and best prac­tices. Held vir­tu­ally as a Zoom we­bi­nar, this year’s fo­rum was themed Work­place Dis­abil­ity In­clu­sion – A New Norm. It fo­cused on is­sues around work­place dis­abil­ity in­clu­sion and ac­ces­si­bil­ity, and their im­pli­ca­tions on the fu­ture of work.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said job sup­port ini­tia­tives had been moved on­line as far as pos­si­ble dur­ing the pan­demic, with con­sid­er­a­tions for how peo­ple with disabiliti­es would be able to ac­cess them.</p>
    <p>To fa­cil­i­tate e-learn­ing, SG En­able helped train­ing providers to con­vert phys­i­cal lessons into on­line mod­ules where pos­si­ble, he added.</p>
    <p>He said: “We also con­tin­ued to ex­plore roles in sec­tors that are still hir­ing dur­ing Covid-19 – for ex­am­ple, ad­min and hu­man re­sources, bank­ing and fi­nance, agritech­nol­ogy and land­scape, IT, clean­ing and the pub­lic sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>Such va­can­cies were made avail­able dur­ing SG En­able’s vir­tual ca­reer fair in April, and an­other fair will be held later this year, he added.</p>
    <p>He noted that ex­ist­ing schemes for peo­ple with disabiliti­es have re­cently been en­hanced, af­ter they were out­lined in the Bud­get ear­lier this year. These in­clude an in­crease in the Open Door Pro­gramme train­ing grant from this month to cover 95 per cent of course fees, up from the pre­vi­ous 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing those at­tend­ing the fo­rum, Mr Lee said: “I hope that you will take away prac­ti­cal strate­gies, be in­spired to build a more in­clu­sive work­place and, in so do­ing, build a more in­clu­sive Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
