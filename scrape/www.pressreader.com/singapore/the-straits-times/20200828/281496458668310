    <p>SEOUL • South Korea was in­ves­ti­gat­ing a new coro­n­avirus out­break among 28 peo­ple in a res­i­den­tial block in its cap­i­tal Seoul yes­ter­day, as it re­ported the big­gest daily rise in in­fec­tions since March.</p>
    <p>City of­fi­cials planned to test 500 res­i­dents at a tem­po­rary site in front of the block and sent a team of spe­cial­ists to in­ves­ti­gate how res­i­dents on five dif­fer­ent floors were in­fected, one of the of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>At least 28 of the 436 tested were pos­i­tive for Covid-19, with eight of them liv­ing in apart­ments right above one an­other, the of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>“Seoul city is con­duct­ing a first on-site in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” said Ms Park Yoo-mi, a gen­eral direc­tor in the city gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts in ar­eas from epi­demi­ol­ogy to con­struc­tion, as well as the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (KCDC), have been drafted in to un­cover the route of in­fec­tion, she added.</p>
    <p>KCDC of­fi­cial Kwon Jun-wook said the virus was more likely to have spread via the lifts of the apart­ment block than its vents.</p>
    <p>“The pos­si­bil­ity is not seen as high for the trans­mis­sion route through the ven­ti­la­tion open­ings,” he added, cit­ing ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Last month, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion ac­knowl­edged the pos­si­bil­ity of air­borne trans­mis­sion of the virus, but stopped short of con­firm­ing it spreads through the air.</p>
    <p>A study in China, how­ever, found virus traces in the bath­room of a va­cant flat above that of some in­fected ten­ants, sug­gest­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of trans­mis­sion as an aerosol through sewage pipes.</p>
    <p>South Korea suf­fered a set­back this month in its bat­tle with the virus as a church out­break spread to a po­lit­i­cal rally, de­spite ear­lier suc­cess in rein­ing it in, com­pared with other na­tions.</p>
    <p>The KCDC re­ported 441 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions as of Wed­nes­day – the high­est daily tally since the first large out­break in March.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, the au­thor­i­ties urged busi­nesses to get em­ploy­ees to work from home, fear­ing the risk of out­breaks in crowded places, such as at a call cen­tre in March and a lo­gis­tics cen­tre in June.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo said at least 80 per cent of the in­fec­tions over the past week are from the densely pop­u­lated Seoul metropoli­tan area and many were linked to the Sarang Jeil church and a po­lit­i­cal rally on Aug 15.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties have sent a list of at least 51,000 peo­ple, who have been cat­e­gorised as be­ing linked to the rally, to lo­cal gov­ern­ments, Health Min­istry of­fi­cial Yoon Tae-ho said.</p>
    <p>South Korea had to shut its Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day af­ter some law­mak­ers went into self-quar­an­tine fol­low­ing con­tact with a pos­i­tive case.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional As­sem­bly was closed af­ter a pho­to­jour­nal­ist who had cov­ered a rul­ing party meet­ing on Wed­nes­day was later tested and con­firmed to have Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The re­sult prompted more than 10 top Democrats – in­clud­ing the party chair­man and its par­lia­men­tary leader – to un­dergo tests of their own and go into self-iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials or­dered all par­lia­men­tary ac­tiv­i­ties to be sus­pended from yes­ter­day, with both the Na­tional As­sem­bly and a build­ing hous­ing law­mak­ers’ of­fices closed.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion par­ties also can­celled sched­uled meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day was South Korea’s 14th con­sec­u­tive day of triple-digit in­creases in case numbers, bring­ing the to­tal to 18,706, with a death toll of 313.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the largest clus­ter is from the Sarang Jeil church. All re­li­gious ser­vices were banned ear­lier this month in the greater Seoul area and Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in met more than 15 Protes­tant church lead­ers, ask­ing for their co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
