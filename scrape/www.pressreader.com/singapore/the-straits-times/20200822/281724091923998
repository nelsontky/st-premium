    <p>A 61-year-old Sin­ga­porean man who went to work at SLR Revo­lu­tion, a cam­era shop in Ex­cel­sior Shop­ping Cen­tre, is among five un­linked Covid-19 com­mu­nity cases re­ported by the Health Min­istry yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He tested pos­i­tive for the virus on Thurs­day and was de­tected un­der the min­istry’s en­hanced com­mu­nity testing, in which all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and older are tested when they are di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion on see­ing a doc­tor for the first time.</p>
    <p>Three of the other un­linked com­mu­nity cases – a Malaysian, an In­dian national and a Bangladesh­i national – were iden­ti­fied by ros­tered rou­tine testing of work­ers in the constructi­on, marine and process sec­tors who are liv­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries. They tested pos­i­tive be­tween Thurs­day and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A 47-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman was also among the un­linked com­mu­nity cases. She tested pos­i­tive on Thurs­day and was de­tected as part of the min­istry’s ef­forts to screen in­di­vid­u­als work­ing in front-line Covid-19 op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>There was one linked com­mu­nity case – a 14-yearold Sin­ga­porean boy – who had been placed on quar­an­tine ear­lier, and was tested dur­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Among the 13 im­ported cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, two were short-term visit pass hold­ers. One had ar­rived from In­dia on Aug 7, and the other from the Philip­pines on Aug 9.</p>
    <p>They were al­lowed to en­ter Sin­ga­pore be­cause one is a spouse and care­giver of a pa­tient re­ceiv­ing med­i­cal treat­ment here, while the other is em­ployed to work here on a project ba­sis.</p>
    <p>An­other five im­ported cases are work pass and work per­mit hold­ers em­ployed here. They ar­rived from the Philip­pines and Bri­tain be­tween Aug 7 and Aug 10.</p>
    <p>One of the im­ported cases is a 49-year-old Sin­ga­porean man who had re­turned from In­dia on Aug 7 and tested pos­i­tive on Thurs­day. Among the five de­pen­dant’s pass and long-term visit pass hold­ers are four who ar­rived from In­dia and Bri­tain be­tween Aug 8 and Aug 10.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more places have been added to the list of premises vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while in­fec­tious. They in­clude Tampines Mall and Cold Stor­age at West Mall. Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 98 cases, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,216.</p>
