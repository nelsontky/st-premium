    <p>BER­LIN • Ger­man re­searchers are piec­ing to­gether the life of a pre­his­toric woman who died more than 5,000 years ago in the Ne­olithic pe­riod, af­ter her skele­ton was found dur­ing ex­ca­va­tion works for wind tur­bines.</p>
    <p>The “Lady of Bi­etikow”, as she has been named, was found near a vil­lage of the same name in north­east­ern Ger­many’s Uck­er­mark re­gion.</p>
    <p>The skele­ton had been buried in a set­tle­ment in a squat­ting po­si­tion, one of the old­est known forms of burial, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions show that she was be­tween 30 and 45 years old and died more than 5,000 years ago.</p>
    <p>That means she lived dur­ing the same pe­riod as Oetzi the Ice­man, the stun­ningly pre­served corpse found by tourists in the Alps in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>“You can com­pare Oetzi and the Lady of Bi­etikow in terms of age,” said Mr Philipp Roskoschin­ski, one of the two ar­chae­ol­o­gists who made the dis­cov­ery in the state of Bran­den­burg, which sur­rounds Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>Oetzi was found by two hik­ers in 1991 in the Oet­z­tal Alps on the bor­der be­tween Aus­tria and Italy.</p>
    <p>His body was ex­tremely well pre­served, with or­gans, skin and other or­ganic ma­te­rial still in­tact – re­searchers were even able to see what he had eaten hours be­fore he died.</p>
    <p>“The dis­cov­ery of Oetzi was much more spec­tac­u­lar due to the con­di­tions of preser­va­tion,” Mr Roskoschin­ski said.</p>
    <p>All that is left of Lady Bi­etikow are bones and some frag­ments of cloth­ing, but re­searchers have still man­aged to piece to­gether some</p>
    <p>de­tails about her life.</p>
    <p>It was dur­ing the Ne­olithic pe­riod that hu­mans first in­tro­duced grains into their diet, since they could be stored more eas­ily than meat and could also be used as a means of pay­ment, ac­cord­ing to an­thro­pol­o­gist Bet­tina Jungk­laus.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this led to a de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in peo­ple’s gen­eral health.</p>
    <p>This can be seen in the state of the Lady of Bi­etikow’s teeth, which are se­verely eroded and miss­ing com­pletely in some places, Dr Jungk­laus said.</p>
    <p>“Nor­mally there is enamel on the sur­face of the teeth. But here it is heav­ily worn, chewed off,” she said.</p>
    <p>“This al­lows us to draw con­clu­sions about her diet: it was prob­a­bly very rich in fi­bre, very hard. There are cer­tain grains that cause the teeth to wear out eas­ily.”</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear whether the con­di­tion of the Lady of Bi­etikow’s teeth in­di­cates an ill­ness or even the cause of her death.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers are now hop­ing to find out more about her life, in­clud­ing whether she came from the Uck­er­mark re­gion or had im­mi­grated there from else­where.</p>
    <p>The skele­ton had been buried in a set­tle­ment in a squat­ting po­si­tion, one of the old­est known forms of burial, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia. In­ves­ti­ga­tions show that she was be­tween 30 and 45 years old and died more than 5,000 years ago. That means she lived dur­ing the same pe­riod as Oetzi the Ice­man, the stun­ningly pre­served corpse found by tourists in the Alps in the 1990s.</p>
