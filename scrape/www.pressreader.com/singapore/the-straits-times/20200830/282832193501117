    <p>The news came from a col­league – not a doc­tor, but some­one who works in the emer­gency room and has seen first-hand the dev­as­ta­tion caused by the pan­demic. “There is a cure for Covid-19,” he said. “It must be true be­cause a doc­tor friend shared a Face­book post about this cure.”</p>
    <p>When con­fronted with the lat­est, cred­i­ble sci­en­tific ev­i­dence – that there is no cure for Covid-19, that the dis­ease has killed more than 180,000 Amer­i­cans pre­cisely be­cause we have no ef­fec­tive way of avert­ing death for the mil­lions who are in­fected – he dou­bled down. “But I saw it on Face­book,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the emer­gency room and in con­ver­sa­tions with the Amer­i­can pub­lic through ca­ble news in­ter­views and op-eds like this one, we’ve both been work­ing to dis­sect and de­bunk the many myths about this new virus, its po­ten­tial treat­ments and the pos­si­bil­ity of a vac­cine. We read the mis­truths on our pa­tient’s phones, lis­ten to the­o­ries bor­rowed from In­ter­net cha­t­rooms and watch as friends and family scroll through Face­book say­ing: “Here – it says that this was def­i­nitely cre­ated in a Chi­nese lab­o­ra­tory.”</p>
    <p>Seven months into the worst pan­demic of our life­time, the virus con­tin­ues to spread along­side med­i­cal myths and health hoaxes. False news is not a new phe­nom­e­non, but it has been am­pli­fied by so­cial me­dia. A new re­port about Face­book from Avaaz, a non-profit ad­vo­cacy or­gan­i­sa­tion that tracks false in­for­ma­tion, shows how wide­spread and per­va­sive this am­pli­fi­ca­tion is.</p>
    <p>Web­sites spread­ing health hoaxes on Face­book peaked at an es­ti­mated 460 mil­lion views on the plat­form in April, ac­cord­ing to the re­port, just as the virus was spread­ing around the world and over­whelm­ing hos­pi­tals in New York City. Face­book claims to as­sess and add warn­ing la­bels to fac­tu­ally in­cor­rect posts; but in a sub­set of posts an­a­lysed by Avaaz, only 16 per cent of those con­tain­ing health mis­in­for­ma­tion had a warn­ing la­bel.</p>
    <p>Face­book’s al­go­rithm re­wards and en­cour­ages en­gage­ment with con­tent that pro­vokes strong emo­tions, which is ex­actly the kind of con­tent we warn pa­tients to doubt and care­fully as­sess, since false in­for­ma­tion is of­ten pack­aged as novel and sen­sa­tional. The re­port’s ti­tle calls Face­book’s al­go­rithm “A Ma­jor Threat to Pub­lic Health” – some­thing our clin­i­cal and re­search ex­pe­ri­ences am­ply con­firm.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health or­gan­i­sa­tions have been un­able to keep up with the deluge of so­phis­ti­cated med­i­cal myths and pseu­do­science shared on Face­book. De­spite the ef­forts of the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO), con­tent from the top 10 health mis­in­for­ma­tion sites re­ceived four times as many Face­book views as con­tent from the CDC, WHO and eight other lead­ing health in­sti­tu­tions dur­ing April.</p>
    <p>Face­book en­ables known mis­in­for­ma­tion spreaders to share their bunk widely. Net­works spread­ing health con­spir­acy the­o­ries and pseu­do­science gen­er­ated an es­ti­mated 3.8 bil­lion Face­book views be­tween May 28 last year and</p>
    <p>May 27 this year.</p>
    <p>The re­port quan­ti­fies the reach of so-called su­per­spread­ers of health mis­in­for­ma­tion and dis­in­for­ma­tion on Face­book, in­clud­ing web­sites such as GreenMedIn­fo and RealFar­macy, which pack­age pseu­do­science as cred­i­ble, be­liev­able news. These in­clude false claims that 5G tech­nol­ogy is harm­ful to hu­man health and that cer­tain types of vac­cines have never been tested.</p>
    <p>While GreenMedIn­fo has been re­moved from Pin­ter­est, it thrives on Face­book: In the last year, it re­ceived more than 39 mil­lion views. And RealFar­macy, which ac­cord­ing to Avaaz is on track to be­come one of the largest health mis­in­for­ma­tion net­works in the world, re­ceived an as­ton­ish­ing 581 mil­lion views in a year. One ar­ti­cle alone, hawk­ing col­loidal sil­ver as a treat­ment for viruses, was viewed an es­ti­mated 4.5 mil­lion times. We can’t com­pete with a global plat­form whose pow­er­ful al­go­rithm re­wards sen­sa­tional, false con­tent.</p>
    <p>We see the con­se­quences in the clinic and the emer­gency room. Pa­tients ques­tion our ev­i­dence-based med­i­cal guid­ance, refuse safe treat­ments and vac­cines, and cite Face­book posts as “proof” that Covid-19 is not real.</p>
    <p>While doc­tors and other health­care pro­fes­sion­als play a crit­i­cal role in ed­u­cat­ing the pub­lic, we are not im­mune to the so­phis­ti­cated tech­niques of false in­for­ma­tion. Col­leagues have con­fided in us that they be­lieve the virus is man-made and di­min­ish­ing in strength; oth­ers have asked us to in­vest money in Covid-19 “cures”. While we try, each day, to counter these dan­ger­ous false­hoods that cir­cu­late among our pa­tients and our peers, our abil­ity to coun­sel and pro­vide care is di­min­ished by a so­cial net­work that bol­sters dis­trust in sci­ence and medicine. Face­book is mak­ing it harder for us to do our jobs.</p>
    <p>Pur­vey­ors of false news will al­ways ex­ist; for as long as there have been epi­demics there have been snake oil sales­peo­ple ex­ploit­ing fear and ped­dling false hope. But Face­book en­ables these char­la­tans to thrive. Ab­sent a con­certed ef­fort from Face­book to re­work its al­go­rithm in the best in­ter­ests of pub­lic health – and not profit – we will con­tinue to throw wa­ter on lit­tle fires of mis­in­for­ma­tion, while an in­ferno blazes around us.</p>
