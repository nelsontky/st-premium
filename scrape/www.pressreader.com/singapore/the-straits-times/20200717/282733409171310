    <p>LON­DON • Hol­ly­wood star Johnny Depp’s for­mer es­tate man­ager told Lon­don’s High Court on Wed­nes­day that he found a piece of the ac­tor’s sev­ered finger fol­low­ing his al­leged con­fronta­tion with for­mer wife, ac­tress Am­ber Heard.</p>
    <p>Depp, 57, is su­ing the pub­lisher of Bri­tain’s Sun news­pa­per for li­bel over an ar­ti­cle in 2018 in which it la­belled him a wife-beater and re­ferred to “over­whelm­ing ev­i­dence” that he had at­tacked Heard, 34.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben King, who worked for Depp be­tween 2014 and 2015, said that Heard was the “an­tag­o­niser” in her re­la­tion­ship with Depp and that the pair would ar­gue like school­child­ren.</p>
    <p>Mr King, who was in­volved in a clean-up op­er­a­tion af­ter an al­leged in­ci­dent at a rented prop­erty in Aus­tralia in 2015, said he found the ac­tor’s sev­ered fin­ger­tip.</p>
    <p>He said it was lo­cated by the bar area of the home, while there was a trail of blood spots up the stairs.</p>
    <p>“It was men­tioned that it may be some­where and when I was clear­ing up I found it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Depp has pre­vi­ously re­counted how Heard had sev­ered the tip of his finger when she threw a bot­tle of vodka at him.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing five days of tes­ti­mony, Depp said Heard’s 14 al­le­ga­tions of do­mes­tic violence, which spanned three years from 2013, were lies and that she had reg­u­larly as­saulted him.</p>
    <p>Ms Kate James, Heard’s for­mer per­sonal as­sis­tant, also ac­cused the ac­tress of “steal­ing” her story of be­ing a vic­tim of sex­ual as­sault.</p>
    <p>“Much to my ut­ter shock and dis­may, I dis­cov­ered that Ms Heard had in fact stolen my sex­ual violence con­ver­sa­tion with her and twisted it into her own story to ben­e­fit her­self,” Ms James, who worked for Heard from 2012 to 2015, told the court via video link from Los An­ge­les on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Heard is due to start giv­ing ev­i­dence to­day, while Depp’s for­mer long-term part­ner, French singer and ac­tress Vanessa Par­adis, was sched­uled to ap­pear by video con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
