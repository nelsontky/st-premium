    <p>Q What does this mean for users?</p>
    <p>A If you have TikTok down­loaded on your phone, you are fine – for now. The US Com­merce De­part­ment will wait un­til Nov 12 – af­ter the elec­tion – to pur­sue a full ban on TikTok.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if you have deleted the TikTok app from your phone, be­gin­ning today, you will not be able to down­load it again, even if you have a TikTok ac­count.</p>
    <p>You also will not be able to re­ceive any soft­ware up­dates that fix bugs and add fea­tures.</p>
    <p>The pro­hi­bi­tion is more im­me­di­ate for WeChat users. Start­ing today, not only will you not be able to down­load the WeChat app or soft­ware up­dates from the App Store or Google Play, you also will not be able to send pay­ments to fam­ily mem­bers or busi­nesses that use WeChat as a pay­ment method.</p>
    <p>Q Will the app func­tions be af­fected?</p>
    <p>A Yes. WeChat and TikTok are live In­ter­net services that re­quire main­te­nance, which in­cludes se­cu­rity and bug fixes. If you stop re­ceiv­ing such up­dates, the apps may even­tu­ally cease to work prop­erly.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion may be even more dire for WeChat users. Be­cause of the ban on trans­ac­tions be­tween US busi­nesses and WeChat, the ser­vice may be­gin to de­grade today. Send­ing of mes­sages may be­gin to slow or even time out.</p>
    <p>For TikTok users, that ser­vice degra­da­tion will not hap­pen un­less a full ban takes ef­fect on Nov 12.</p>
    <p>Q What can I do? A</p>
    <p>Noth­ing prac­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>Google An­droid users may try to “side­load” fu­ture ver­sions of the WeChat and TikTok apps onto their de­vices, a process that in­volves chang­ing some se­cu­rity set­tings to down­load apps from out­side Google’s of­fi­cial app store.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple phones also have meth­ods that let you in­stall unau­tho­rised ap­pli­ca­tions. But side­load­ing and in­stalling apps through un­of­fi­cial chan­nels is not prac­ti­cal be­cause it can com­pro­mise de­vice se­cu­rity and it is not easy for many peo­ple to do.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple and Google users can also try to down­load the apps from for­eign app stores by trav­el­ling to other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Or they could use a vir­tual pri­vate net­work, a ser­vice that cre­ates a vir­tual tun­nel to shield your brows­ing in­for­ma­tion from your In­ter­net ser­vice provider, to ma­nip­u­late their de­vice lo­ca­tion. Again, this is im­prac­ti­cal.</p>
