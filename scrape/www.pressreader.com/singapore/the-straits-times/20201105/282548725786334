    <p>PARIS • Gareth Bale will hope to use to­day’s Europa League game against Lu­do­gorets to fur­ther sharpen his fit­ness fol­low­ing his re­turn to Tot­ten­ham, while Arse­nal and Le­ices­ter can take a step to­wards the knock­out stages with a third win in a row.</p>
    <p>Bale, 31, scored his first Spurs goal in seven years since re­join­ing the club on loan from Real Madrid to earn Jose Mour­inho’s side a 2-1 vic­tory over Brighton on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Welsh­man is grad­u­ally work­ing his way back to form after a knee in­jury delayed his sec­ond de­but, with his only starts for Tot­ten­ham so far com­ing in Europe.</p>
    <p>“I’m feel­ing good,” said Bale. “I’m get­ting a lot fit­ter, ob­vi­ously it’s been good to get a cou­ple of starts in the Europa League, get­ting more min­utes (Sun­day) will ben­e­fit me again.</p>
    <p>“I’m stay­ing pa­tient, I know I have to build my match fit­ness, it’s been a while since I put a cou­ple of games to­gether, so I’ll con­tinue to work hard in train­ing ev­ery day, and in the games when I’m given the chance.”</p>
    <p>Spurs must hit the re­set but­ton after a limp 1-0 de­feat by An­twerp in Bel­gium last week left Mour­inho unim­pressed, and be­moan­ing not be­ing able to re­place the en­tire team at half-time.</p>
    <p>They visit a Lu­do­gorets side hunt­ing their first points in Group J after Elvis Manu’s hat-trick came in a 4-3 loss for the Bul­gar­i­ans at Aus­trian out­fit Lask Linz on match-day two.</p>
    <p>Arse­nal will be on course for the last 32 with vic­tory at home to Nor­we­gians Molde. Both teams have six points in Group B.</p>
    <p>Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang’s penalty earned the Gun­ners a 1-0 win at Manch­ester United on Sun­day – their first Pre­mier League vic­tory at Old Traf­ford since 2006.</p>
    <p>“We are cre­at­ing ex­pec­ta­tions as well be­cause we beat United and... (ear­lier) we beat Chelsea, and then we beat Man City, then Liver­pool in the Cup. We want to build them all the time,” said Arse­nal coach Mikel Arteta.</p>
    <p>“We need to gen­er­ate the be­lief that we can go to any ground and be com­pet­i­tive. It’s some­thing that we’ve got al­ready, in my opin­ion.”</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter have shrugged off last sea­son’s col­lapse that saw them fall short of the Cham­pi­ons League by win­ning five of their first seven games in a top-flight sea­son for the first time in their his­tory.</p>
    <p>The Foxes have beaten Zo­rya Luhansk and AEK Athens in Group G and next host Braga, who also have six points after two rounds.</p>
    <p>Serie A lead­ers AC Mi­lan put their 24-match un­beaten run on the line against Lille, who are sec­ond in Ligue 1 and also yet to lose in any com­pe­ti­tion this term.</p>
    <p>Celtic host Sparta Prague in the other game in Group H, while Steven Ger­rard’s Rangers are chas­ing a third win in as many fix­tures away to Group D front run­ners Ben­fica.</p>
    <p>I’m stay­ing pa­tient, I know I have to build my match fit­ness, it’s been a while since I put a cou­ple of games to­gether, so I’ll con­tinue to work hard in train­ing ev­ery day, and in the games when I’m given the chance.</p>
