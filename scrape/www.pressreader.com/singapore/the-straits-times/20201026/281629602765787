    <p>The lo­cal health au­thor­i­ties have ad­vised against the use of two in­fluenza vac­cines – SKYCellflu Quadri­va­lent and Vax­i­gripTe­tra – af­ter sev­eral peo­ple died af­ter re­ceiv­ing them in South Korea.</p>
    <p>No deaths associated with in­fluenza vac­ci­na­tion have been recorded here, noted the Min­istry of Health (MOH) and the Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity (HSA) yes­ter­day, adding: “This is a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure fol­low­ing re­ported deaths af­ter in­fluenza vac­ci­na­tion in South Korea.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported ear­lier that 36 deaths were recorded in South Korea as of Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion from the South Korean au­thor­i­ties noted that seven brands of in­fluenza vac­cine had been ad­min­is­tered to the peo­ple who died in South Korea.</p>
    <p>Two of the seven brands are avail­able in Sin­ga­pore: SKYCellflu Quadri­va­lent is man­u­fac­tured by SK Bio­science and dis­trib­uted here by AJ Bi­o­log­ics; Vax­i­gripTe­tra is made by Sanofi Pas­teur and lo­cally dis­trib­uted by Sanofi Aven­tis.</p>
    <p>The HSA is as­sess­ing the im­pli­ca­tions of the re­ported deaths in South Korea and the MOH has told health­care providers and med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers to tem­po­rar­ily stop us­ing the two vac­cines.</p>
    <p>But the two other vac­cines that have been brought into Sin­ga­pore for the in­fluenza sea­son can still be used, they added.</p>
    <p>Like any medicines, vac­cines can cause side ef­fects, such as sore­ness and red­ness at the in­jec­tion site, fever, headaches, mus­cle aches, fa­tigue and nausea.</p>
    <p>“These side ef­fects are gen­er­ally mild and re­solve on their own. In rare in­stances, a per­son may ex­pe­ri­ence high fever or se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions (such as breath­ing dif­fi­culty, wheez­ing and swelling around the eyes) and im­me­di­ate med­i­cal at­ten­tion should be sought,” said the agen­cies. They added that vac­cines ap­proved for use here have been eval­u­ated by the HSA to en­sure that they meet the re­quired internatio­nal stan­dards of qual­ity, safety and ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>The HSA mon­i­tors vac­cine safety through a mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem that draws on the net­work of lo­cal health­care pro­fes­sion­als and internatio­nal reg­u­la­tory coun­ter­parts to pick up ad­verse events sus­pected to be associated with the med­i­ca­tions.</p>
