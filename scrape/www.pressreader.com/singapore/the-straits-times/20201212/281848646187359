    <p>• France is set to lift a sixweek-long coro­n­avirus lock­down as ex­pected on Tues­day, but will im­pose a cur­few from 8pm, in­clud­ing on New Year’s Eve, as the num­ber of cases creeps up again.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter J ean Cas­tex ended days of spec­u­la­tion over the year-end hol­i­days by con­firm­ing on Thurs­day that fam­i­lies would be al­lowed to travel to cel­e­brate Christ­mas to­gether.</p>
    <p>But he said mu­se­ums, the­atres and cin­e­mas, which had been hop­ing to try to re­coup some of their losses over the hol­i­days, would re­main closed for an ex­tra three weeks, as will foot­ball sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>Mr Cas­tex said the sit­u­a­tion had “con­sid­er­ably im­proved” since France en­tered a sec­ond lock­down on Oct 30, not­ing that the num­ber of new in­fec­tions had fallen from nearly 50,000 a day in late Oc­to­ber to around 10,000.</p>
    <p>But the fall “has slowed over the past sev­eral days”, he said.</p>
    <p>“We’re on a sort of plateau,” Mr Cas­tex said, warn­ing that if the French dropped their guard, they could face a third lock­down.</p>
    <p>The cur­few to take ef­fect on Tues­day will be from 8pm to 6am, with the ex­cep­tion of Dec 24, when fam­i­lies can cel­e­brate</p>
    <p>Christ­mas, but with no more than six adults per house­hold. The gov­ern­ment is main­tain­ing its tar­get for re­open­ing bars and restau­rants on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Olivier Veran ad­mit­ted that France would fall far short of its goal of a max­i­mum 5,000 new cases per day by Tues­day, when the lock­down ends.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the coun­try recorded nearly 14,000 cases over the pre­vi­ous 24 hours, com­pared with 12,000 a week ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron had ini­tially con­di­tioned lift­ing the lock­down on the 5,000-case level be­ing met, but re­vised his stance to af­ford the French some re­lief af­ter weeks of seclu­sion. The re­stric­tions were partly eased on Nov 28, when busi­nesses sell­ing “non-essen­tial” goods and ser­vices, such as book­shops and hair­dressers, were al­lowed to re­open.</p>
    <p>The to­tal death toll in France stands at over 55,000.</p>
    <p>Cul­ture Min­is­ter Rose­lyne Bach­e­lot pledged an ex­tra €35 mil­lion (S$56.7 mil­lion) yes­ter­day to bail out mu­se­ums, cin­e­mas and the­atres left “stunned” by the ex­ten­sion of the re­stric­tions.</p>
