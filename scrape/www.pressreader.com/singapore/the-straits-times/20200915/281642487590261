    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has hit busi­nesses and work­ers hard, with those in the con­sumer-fac­ing and tourism-re­lated sec­tors bear­ing the brunt of the hit, as well as those af­fected by tem­po­rary work stop­pages.</p>
    <p>These sec­tors in­clude man­u­fac­tur­ing, con­struc­tion, whole­sale and re­tail trade, ac­com­mo­da­tion and food ser­vices, and arts, en­ter­tain­ment and recre­ation, ac­cord­ing to the labour mar­ket re­port for the sec­ond quar­ter out yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They were also the most af­fected by the cir­cuit breaker and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, the re­port noted.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion sec­tor saw one of the largest de­clines in employment, by 13,600 work­ers, while food and bev­er­age ser­vices saw a plunge of 22,900.</p>
    <p>The re­tail trade in­dus­try shed 8,000 work­ers while the arts, en­ter­tain­ment and recre­ation sec­tor saw employment fall by 7,600.</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tive and sup­port ser­vices also saw worker num­bers fall by 7,600, while the out­war­dori­ented whole­sale trade sec­tor lost 7,900 work­ers as weak external de­mand weighed on employment.</p>
    <p>There were also 8,900 fewer work­ers in man­u­fac­tur­ing, which saw de­clines in all sub-sec­tors ex­cept elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, sec­tors that were con­sid­ered essen­tial ser­vices or where re­mote work was more likely were less af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions sec­tor lost only 700 work­ers in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial and in­sur­ance ser­vices also saw a drop of 700 work­ers, while health and so­cial ser­vices shed 1,400 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Employment even in­creased by 1,000 in elec­tron­ics man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>In­deed, rather than shed­ding work­ers, in­surer Great Eastern hired more than 200 new join­ers in cor­po­rate roles from Jan­uary to last month. It also hired more than 500 fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives from April to the end of last month.</p>
    <p>But on the other end of the spec­trum, work­ers at con­struc­tion firms had their labour halted, es­pe­cially dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker months.</p>
    <p>Straits Con­struc­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ken­neth Loo said some staff were put on forms of com­pul­sory leave. Other firms also cut work­ers’ pay.</p>
    <p>“We were mind­ful of gov­ern­ment sup­port but it did not cover the full ex­tent of our ex­po­sure to the blow. There was vir­tu­ally no rev­enue for the sec­tor,” he added.</p>
    <p>In terms of for­eign employment, the de­cline was sharper than lo­cal de­creases in sec­tors such as man­u­fac­tur­ing and con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the de­cline in lo­cal employment was higher than for their for­eign coun­ter­parts in ser­vices, led by cut­backs in ac­com­mo­da­tion and food ser­vices, whole­sale and re­tail trade, and arts, en­ter­tain­ment and recre­ation.</p>
    <p>But when ad­justed in re­la­tion to the size of the work­force, the lo­cal rate of de­cline in ser­vices was much lower than that for for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>The rise in re­trench­ment over the quar­ter also hit out­ward-ori­ented sec­tors such as whole­sale trade more, with an in­crease also seen in man­u­fac­tur­ing, par­tic­u­larly in trans­port equip­ment and fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The re­port noted that those laid off in man­u­fac­tur­ing were mostly pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs). But re­trench­ments in fi­nan­cial ser­vices and whole­sale trade af­fected nonPMETs more.</p>
    <p>There were also sharp increases in short work weeks and tem­po­rary lay­off ar­range­ments, es­pe­cially in con­struc­tion, man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vices. This re­flected re­duced visi­tor ar­rivals and domestic con­sump­tion, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>These ar­range­ments largely af­fected pro­duc­tion and re­lated work­ers, who were placed on tem­po­rary lay­offs fol­low­ing the clo­sure of work­places dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. Some PMETs and cler­i­cal, sales and ser­vice work­ers were also made to work shorter hours in­stead.</p>
