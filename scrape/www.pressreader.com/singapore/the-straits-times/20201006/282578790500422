    <p>The Arts House at Old Par­lia­ment House will close for ren­o­va­tions from Dec 1. When it re­opens at the end of March next year, the air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tem will have been over­hauled and the pub­lic will have ac­cess to free Wi-Fi in the build­ing.</p>
    <p>The lengthy clo­sure is “due to the com­plex­i­ties of ren­o­vat­ing and adding new sys­tems within a her­itage build­ing in­fras­truc­ture”, an Arts House spokesman told The Straits Times yes­ter­day in re­sponse to queries.</p>
    <p>This is the first time that the na­tional mon­u­ment will be ren­o­vated since its re­open­ing in 2004, fol­low­ing a $15.8 mil­lion re­fur­bish­ment which turned the his­toric Par­lia­ment build­ing into a mul­tidis­ci­plinary arts cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said the ren­o­va­tion was planned with min­i­mal dis­rup­tion to the cen­tre’s arts cal­en­dar in mind.</p>
    <p>The Arts House presents two sig­na­ture events an­nu­ally. The Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val, which starts on Oct 30, will end on Nov 8; while the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Fes­ti­val of Arts, which took a hia­tus this year be­cause of the pan­demic, will be held from May 21 to June 6 next year.</p>
    <p>The Arts House has gone dig­i­tal with its pro­grammes dur­ing the pan­demic, said the spokesman, adding: “Dur­ing the ren­o­va­tion pe­riod, we will con­tinue this man­ner of en­gage­ment. We will also ex­plore util­is­ing the other venues within the Arts House port­fo­lio and in­vite mem­bers of the pub­lic to ex­pe­ri­ence art when­ever pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The cen­tre has a black box space which can seat up to 120 peo­ple, a 75-seat screen­ing room and two gallery spa­ces. The Cham­ber, where Par­lia­ment once sat, can ac­com­mo­date up to 200 peo­ple for events.</p>
    <p>There was no in­for­ma­tion on whether the food and bev­er­age out­lets, in­clud­ing Earshot cafe and Tim­bre, will re­turn to the space.</p>
