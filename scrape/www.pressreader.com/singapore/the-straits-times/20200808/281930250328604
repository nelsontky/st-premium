    <p>• The coro­n­avirus cri­sis has weighed heav­ily on print news­pa­pers al­ready bat­tling for sur­vival around the world, with the num­ber of copies sold tum­bling while less prof­itable dig­i­tal read­er­ships surge.</p>
    <p>Sim­ply de­liv­er­ing printed pa­pers to the shops – or hav­ing cus­tomers come in to buy them – has be­come a chal­lenge, wors­en­ing a years-long de­cline in sales and ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“Con­sump­tion of printed news­pa­pers has fallen as lock­downs un­der­mine phys­i­cal dis­tri­bu­tion, al­most cer­tainly ac­cel­er­at­ing the shift to an all-dig­i­tal fu­ture,” the Reuters In­sti­tute’s 2020 an­nual re­port said.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor dailies in Brazil and Mex­ico have al­ready switched to on­line-only or dropped some days’ edi­tions, while in the Philip­pines, 10 of the 70 news­pa­pers in the PPI as­so­ci­a­tion have shut­tered.</p>
    <p>“Times are hard. There are no ad­ver­tis­ers and no one is read­ing us,” PPI ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Ariel Se­bellino told AFP.</p>
    <p>The ar­chi­pel­ago na­tion’s small lo­cal news­pa­pers were hard­est hit dur­ing lock­down as street sales tum­bled. “The in­dus­try is un­der siege and we’ve all taken bruises,” Mr Se­bellino said.</p>
    <p>Far from af­fect­ing only jour­nal­ists, the dis­ap­pear­ance of print pa­pers deals out pain all along the pro­duc­tion chain, tak­ing in print­ers, pa­per mak­ers and de­liv­ery peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor Bri­tish me­dia brands could boast of 6.6 mil­lion new on­line readers in the first quar­ter, in what their in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tion said was a new record.</p>
    <p>But most have not seen the same bounce in print sales.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has be­come “the great­est threat to the global news in­dus­try since the 2008 eco­nomic crash”, wrote in­dus­try pub­li­ca­tion Press Gazette – which it­self went on­line-only in 2013.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2005 and 2018, some 250 lo­cal pa­pers closed across Bri­tain, while to­day, one in three jour­nal­ists’ jobs is be­lieved to be un­der threat.</p>
    <p>The pic­ture is sim­i­lar in the United States, where dozens of pa­pers have closed or merged with lo­cal com­peti­tors. Be­tween 2008 and last year, half of all work­ers in Amer­i­can news­pa­pers lost their jobs, ac­cord­ing to a Pew In­sti­tute count.</p>
    <p>Around the world, au­di­ences have melted away for the free sheets once handed out in busy ur­ban cen­tres. Un­able to count on fund­ing from ad­ver­tis­ers, some have paused pub­li­ca­tion, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>Metro and Des­tak in Brazil, and 20 Min­utes in France.</p>
    <p>With Ger­many’s age­ing pop­u­la­tion used to hold­ing a pa­per in their hands, the coun­try’s news­pa­per pub­lish­ers “were all mak­ing money be­fore the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, even if cir­cu­la­tion fig­ures kept fall­ing”, said Mr Frank Uber­all, pres­i­dent of the DJV jour­nal­ists’ fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Things are dif­fer­ent now,” he said, but added that text jour­nal­ism still has good days ahead. “Old peo­ple, in par­tic­u­lar, are far from adopt­ing dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies en masse.”</p>
    <p>“Print­ing is ex­pen­sive,” said Mr Gilles Dechamps, head of a print­ing com­pany in north­ern Paris, but he ar­gues that “it’s im­por­tant for readers and for ad­ver­tis­ers to have the land­mark” of a printed pa­per.</p>
    <p>De­spite ef­forts like cut­ting their size to save pa­per or in­vest­ing in the Web over the past 30 years, few pa­pers have found the win­ning for­mula to make money from 21st-cen­tury jour­nal­ism.</p>
    <p>“Even in the small­est mar­kets, Facebook and Google siphon three-quar­ters of the dig­i­tal rev­enue,” said Ms Pene­lope Aber­nathy, a for­mer Wall Street Jour­nal and New York Times vice-pres­i­dent who now teaches me­dia eco­nom­ics at the Univer­sity of North Carolina.</p>
    <p>“That leaves all other legacy me­dia fight­ing for the dig­i­tal scraps.”</p>
