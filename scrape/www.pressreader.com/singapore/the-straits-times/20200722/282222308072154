    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive Lionel Yeo said in a state­ment: “The last five years marked many na­tional mile­stones for the Singapore Sports Hub. While we look for­ward to wel­com­ing ev­ery­one back, we are com­mit­ted to sup­port and keep the com­mu­nity en­gaged vir­tu­ally in the mean­time.</p>
    <p>“Through the fifth an­niver­sary and Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions, we hope to up­lift spir­its and gal­vanise the com­mu­nity to jour­ney on­wards and stronger to­gether with us in the new nor­mal.”</p>
