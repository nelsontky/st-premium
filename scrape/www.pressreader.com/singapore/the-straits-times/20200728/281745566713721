    <p>GENEVA • Keep­ing bor­ders closed to stop the spread of Covid-19 is un­sus­tain­able, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) said yes­ter­day, urg­ing coun­tries to adopt com­pre­hen­sive strate­gies based on lo­cal knowl­edge of where the virus is spread­ing.</p>
    <p>Border clo­sures and travel re­stric­tions re­main an im­por­tant part of many coun­tries’ strat­egy to com­bat the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>At the same time, ris­ing cases in a num­ber of coun­tries in Europe and else­where that had loos­ened mea­sures af­ter ap­pear­ing to get their out­breaks un­der con­trol have spurred dis­cus­sions of pos­si­ble fresh border clo­sures.</p>
    <p>But the United Na­tions health body warned that such ac­tions can­not be kept up in­def­i­nitely, and are use­ful only when com­bined with other mea­sures to de­tect and break chains of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“Con­tin­u­ing to keep in­ter­na­tional bor­ders sealed is not nec­es­sar­ily a sus­tain­able strat­egy for the world’s econ­omy, for the world’s poor, or for any­body else,” Dr Michael Ryan, the direc­tor of emer­gen­cies at WHO, said dur­ing a vir­tual briefing.</p>
    <p>He also said coun­tries should be pre­pared to tighten or ease mea­sures ac­cord­ingly. Dr Ryan warned against “re­leas­ing pres­sure” on the virus, which has killed some 650,000 peo­ple and in­fected more than 16.4 mil­lion world­wide.</p>
    <p>Some na­tions in Asia im­posed new re­stric­tions yes­ter­day and an abrupt Bri­tish quar­an­tine on trav­ellers from Spain threw Europe’s sum­mer re­open­ing into dis­ar­ray, as the world con­fronted the prospect of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Surges were re­ported in a num­ber of coun­tries pre­vi­ously sin­gled out as places where the virus was un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia reg­is­tered a record daily rise. Viet­nam locked down the city of Danang, forc­ing the evac­u­a­tion of tens of thou­sands of vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Main­land China con­firmed the most new lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases since early March.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Covid-19 out­break is now grow­ing at the fastest rate in the world, in­creas­ing 20 per cent over the past week to more than 1.4 mil­lion con­firmed cases, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg’s Coro­n­avirus Tracker.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions in the South Asian na­tion of 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple have reached 1.43 mil­lion, in­clud­ing 32,771 deaths, In­dia’s Health Min­istry said, with daily cases close to a record 50,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In­dia is trail­ing only the United States and Brazil in the num­ber of con­firmed in­fec­tions, but its growth in new cases is the fastest.</p>
    <p>Ma­ha­rash­tra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kar­nataka are among the states which have re­ported the max­i­mum num­ber of daily cases.</p>
    <p>The world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous coun­try has been ramp­ing up test­ing, with 515,472 sam­ples taken on Sun­day, ac­cord­ing to the In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search.</p>
    <p>Still, In­dia and Brazil have some of the world’s low­est test­ing rates, with 11.8 tests and 11.93 tests per 1,000 peo­ple re­spec­tively, com­pared with the US, with 152.98 tests per 1,000, and Rus­sia, with 184.34, ac­cord­ing to Our World in Data, a project based at the Univer­sity of Ox­ford.</p>
    <p>The WHO also said yes­ter­day that a key com­mit­tee would meet later this week to dis­cuss Covid-19’s emer­gency sta­tus, six months af­ter it was de­clared. Its chief, Dr Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus, said the health body’s emer­gency com­mit­tee would con­vene to re-ex­am­ine the dec­la­ra­tion that the out­break con­sti­tuted a “pub­lic health emer­gency of in­ter­na­tional con­cern”.</p>
    <p>The dec­la­ra­tion, which marks the high­est level of alarm un­der in­ter­na­tional health rules, must be re-eval­u­ated ev­ery six months.</p>
    <p>Prior to Covid-19, WHO had made such dec­la­ra­tions only five times since the In­ter­na­tional Health Reg­u­la­tions changed in 2007 – for swine flu, po­lio, Zika and twice for Ebola out­breaks in Africa.</p>
    <p>Of those, the cur­rent pan­demic “is eas­ily the most se­vere”, Dr Te­dros said.</p>
    <p>Although there is lit­tle doubt that the emer­gency com­mit­tee will con­sider that the pan­demic still con­sti­tutes a global pub­lic health emer­gency, it could al­ter some of its rec­om­men­da­tions on how the WHO and the world should re­spond.</p>
    <p>WON’T HELP THE WORLD</p>
    <p>Con­tin­u­ing to keep in­ter­na­tional bor­ders sealed is not nec­es­sar­ily a sus­tain­able strat­egy for the world’s econ­omy, for the world’s poor, or for any­body else.</p>
    <p>’’ DR MICHAEL RYAN, direc­tor of emer­gen­cies at the WHO.</p>
