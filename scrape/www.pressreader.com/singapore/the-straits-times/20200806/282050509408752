    <p>A part-time se­cu­rity of­fi­cer was killed last year af­ter he fell into a 4m-deep pit near the 1-Al­ti­tude rooftop bar at One Raf­fles Place.</p>
    <p>A coroner’s in­quiry into Mr Shaun Tung Mun Hon’s death re­vealed that the open­ing had been left un­cov­ered by work­ers who were tasked with clean­ing the build­ing’s fa­cade.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) of­fi­cer told State Coroner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam that the work­ers had found mov­ing the con­crete slab to cover the open­ing on a daily ba­sis “quite trou­ble­some”.</p>
    <p>Bar­ri­cades and warn­ing signs had also been put up near the open­ing at an ear­lier time. But the MOM of­fi­cer tes­ti­fied that these mea­sures were “not ef­fec­tive”.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the min­istry is con­tem­plat­ing ac­tion against the par­ties in­volved and that in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>A con­crete slab cover, weigh­ing about 80kg, had been moved to ex­pose an open­ing near the nightspot on June 9 last year.</p>
    <p>The open­ing led to a pit and guests were barred from en­ter­ing the area sur­round­ing it.</p>
    <p>In­side the open­ing was a switch to op­er­ate a gon­dola, which was used to clean the fa­cade of One Raf­fles Place – a 63-storey build­ing.</p>
    <p>Work­ers tasked to per­form the job had left the open­ing un­cov­ered that day, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Mr Tung, 26, a part-time se­cu­rity guard, was shown the pit and was briefed about it be­fore he started his shift at the al­fresco bar on June 9 last year.</p>
    <p>Part of the sec­ond floor of the nightspot had also been cor­doned off with bar­ri­cades and warn­ing signs. De­spite this, two uniden­ti­fied men en­tered the area at around 1.30am and Mr Tung spot­ted the pair. He ran to­wards the men while shin­ing his torch to warn them but failed to spot the pit him­self and fell in.</p>
    <p>The court heard yes­ter­day that there was no light­ing in the area near the open­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Tung’s col­leagues saw him fall in and his su­per­vi­sor, who rushed for­ward, saw him ly­ing face down at the bot­tom of the pit.</p>
    <p>Paramedics ar­rived at the scene and Mr Tung was pro­nounced dead about 30 min­utes later.</p>
    <p>The au­topsy re­vealed that he died from a head in­jury.</p>
    <p>Mr Tung, fa­ther to a young son, was cre­mated on June 11 last year.</p>
    <p>State Coroner Ka­mala is ex­pected to give her find­ings next Thurs­day.</p>
