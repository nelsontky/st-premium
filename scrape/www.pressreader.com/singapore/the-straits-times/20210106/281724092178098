    <p>About 4,000 peo­ple who had sought to re­ceive the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant (CSG) saw their ap­pli­ca­tions re­jected, as the Min­istry of So­cial and Family Devel­op­ment (MSF) could not ver­ify their em­ploy­ment de­tails.</p>
    <p>This was re­vealed yes­ter­day by Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Family Devel­op­ment Sun Xuel­ing in re­sponse to Ms Car­rie Tan (Nee Soon GRC), who had asked how many grant ap­pli­cants were turned down be­cause they could not pro­duce re­trench­ment let­ters from their em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan also asked if the min­istry would con­sider ap­pli­ca­tions favourably as long as the ap­pli­cants could pro­duce cor­re­spon­dence show­ing that they faced pres­sure from their em­ploy­ers to re­sign.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said the min­istry tries to con­tact em­ploy­ers when ap­pli­cants do not have sup­port­ing doc­u­ments or Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) records.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, MSF does not track the num­ber of ap­pli­cants whose ap­pli­ca­tions were re­jected for the spe­cific rea­son of not be­ing able to pro­duce re­trench­ment let­ters from their em­ploy­ers. We recog­nise that some ap­pli­cants might have been un­able to do so due to rea­sons beyond their con­trol,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun pointed out that some com­pa­nies might have closed down with­out is­su­ing their staff ter­mi­na­tion let­ters. In such in­stances, MSF would ver­ify the ap­pli­cants’ em­ploy­ment sta­tus by check­ing their CPF records or con­tact­ing for­mer em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>She added that ap­pli­cants who claim to have re­signed in­vol­un­tar­ily due to pres­sure from their em­ploy­ers could ap­peal to so­cial ser­vice of­fices.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties will con­sider sup­port­ing ev­i­dence like cor­re­spon­dence with for­mer em­ploy­ers, or if there were ex­ten­u­at­ing cir­cum­stances, she said.</p>
    <p>As at Dec 20, MSF had ap­proved around 95,000 ap­pli­ca­tions, in­clud­ing about 15,000 who had suc­cess­fully ap­pealed.</p>
    <p>About 97 per cent of ap­peals have been suc­cess­ful, Ms Sun added.</p>
    <p>The CSG pro­vides up to $800 a month, for three months, to ful­lor part-time em­ploy­ees who lost their jobs, were placed on in­vol­un­tary no-pay leave or suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant salary loss be­cause of the pan­demic. The grant also pro­vides $500 a month for three months to those who have had at least 30 per cent of their salary re­duced for three months.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for the CSG closed on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>A new Covid-19 Re­cov­ery Grant will be launched on Jan 18 to sup­port lower- to mid­dle-in­come em­ploy­ees and self-em­ployed peo­ple who are fi­nan­cially im­pacted by the pan­demic this year. The grant pro­vides up to $700 a month for three months.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to the CSG, those who are gen­uinely un­able to pro­duce doc­u­ments for the new grant and need help can ap­proach so­cial ser­vice of­fices for as­sis­tance, said Ms Sun.</p>
