    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand plans to open a virus-free “travel bub­ble” with the tiny Pa­cific realm of Cook Is­lands be­fore the year end, Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern said yes­ter­day, while ex­press­ing cau­tion about a sim­i­lar ar­range­ment with Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said that the quar­an­tine-free travel cor­ri­dor was pos­si­ble be­cause New Zealand and the Cooks – an ar­chi­pel­ago of un­der 10,000 peo­ple – had suc­cess­fully con­tained the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“Our ex­pec­ta­tion is that it would be in place be­fore the end of the year,” she told re­porters, adding that of­fi­cials were be­ing care­ful not to move too quickly on the pro­posal.</p>
    <p>“The last thing any­one wants is to re­open travel, only to have it closed down again be­cause it hasn’t been done prop­erly.”</p>
    <p>New Zealand has recorded only 22 coro­n­avirus deaths in a pop­u­la­tion of five mil­lion, and marked 100 days since its last case of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion on Sun­day, while the Cooks de­clared it­self virus-free i n mid-April.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic ben­e­fits of the travel bub­ble are ex­pected to be felt mostly in the Cooks, a pop­u­lar tourist desti­na­tion where Ms Ardern es­ti­mated 60 per cent of pre-virus vis­i­tors were from New Zealand.</p>
    <p>A trans-Tas­man bub­ble with Aus­tralia would be far more ad­van­ta­geous to New Zealand’s econ­omy, where in­ter­na­tional tourism screeched to a halt when bor­ders were closed in March.</p>
    <p>The prospect looked tan­ta­lis­ingly close a few months ago, be­fore Aus­tralia was hit with a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions cen­tred in Vic­to­ria state.</p>
    <p>“We are still un­der­tak­ing the foun­da­tional work for transTas­man travel ar­range­ments, but ob­vi­ously, that is going to be some time off,” Ms Ardern said.</p>
    <p>All in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals into New Zealand are cur­rently re­quired to spend at least 14 days in strictly su­per­vised quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>But New Zealan­ders do­mes­ti­cally are en­joy­ing a near-nor­mal, pre-coro­n­avirus life­style with no so­cial dis­tanc­ing and spec­ta­tors al­lowed at sports and cul­tural events.</p>
