    <p>Sketch­ing out the Govern­ment’s plans and pri­or­i­ties for its new term in of­fice, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob noted that this takes place un­der the shadow of Covid-19, which has sharp­ened global fault lines and dis­rupted the sta­ble in­ter­na­tional or­der un­der which Sin­ga­pore has long thrived.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is at an in­flec­tion point and the coun­try needs to un­der­stand the ma­jor changes tak­ing place, both at home and abroad, as its re­thinks its so­cial mod­els and poli­cies to suit the new cir­cum­stances, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes tak­ing a fresh look at its cru­cial pil­lars of so­ci­ety, such as its con­cept of mer­i­toc­racy, mul­tira­cial­ism, and the way Sin­ga­pore con­ducts its pol­i­tics, the Pres­i­dent said at the open­ing of the 14th Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>For the first time, the event took place at two lo­ca­tions – Par­lia­ment House and the Arts House – to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sketch­ing out the Govern­ment’s plans and pri­or­i­ties for its new term in of­fice, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah noted that this takes place un­der the shadow of Covid-19, which has sharp­ened global fault lines and dis­rupted the sta­ble in­ter­na­tional or­der un­der which Sin­ga­pore has long thrived.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has fu­elled a new wave of pro­tec­tion­ism and this is “es­pe­cially chal­leng­ing for Sin­ga­pore, as we make our liv­ing by do­ing busi­ness with the world”, she said.</p>
    <p>At home, new gen­er­a­tions com­ing of age have their own as­pi­ra­tions, such as a de­sire for more di­verse voices to be heard and stronger checks and bal­ances. New lead­ers are also emerg­ing to take the coun­try for­ward, she noted, adding that they would have to forge bonds and a new com­pact with the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“For Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue to suc­ceed, we need to un­der­stand th­ese changes in our ex­ter­nal and do­mes­tic en­vi­ron­ments, re­think our prob­lems and im­prove on our sta­tus quo,” said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah.</p>
    <p>There is also a “great ur­gency to trans­form the econ­omy and find new ways of making a liv­ing”, in­clud­ing a push for sus­tain­able growth and a greener fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, she said, can­not take its hub sta­tus for granted, as­sum­ing that its role and scope would re­main un­changed.</p>
    <p>Se­cur­ing jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans will re­main the Govern­ment’s top pri­or­ity for the next few years, but it must also en­sure the ben­e­fits of progress are shared widely with all cit­i­zens, she said.</p>
    <p>While mer­i­toc­racy has served Sin­ga­pore well for the past 55 years, the model has to evolve in tan­dem with the coun­try’s devel­op­ment, the same way so­cial safety nets have been strength­ened over the past decade.</p>
    <p>As part of this shift in so­cial pol­icy, she said the Govern­ment will do more to sup­port every Sin­ga­porean, at each stage of life.</p>
    <p>“More re­dis­tri­bu­tion can­not be the only way to level up those who are do­ing less well,” she said. “We also have to con­tinue strength­en­ing so­cial mo­bil­ity and broad­en­ing our con­cep­tion of merit.”</p>
    <p>And while mul­tira­cial­ism has been a core el­e­ment of Sin­ga­porean iden­tity since in­de­pen­dence, it re­mains a work in progress, said the Pres­i­dent. Younger Sin­ga­pore­ans want th­ese is­sues dis­cussed can­didly, but it must be done with care, she added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans need to recog­nise that there are larger forces at play that will test the na­tion’s sol­i­dar­ity and pull peo­ple in dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions, she said.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing against turn­ing in­ward in the face of tough times, she said: “Our Sin­ga­porean iden­tity has been formed and strength­ened not by ex­clud­ing those who ar­rive later, but by suc­ces­sive ar­rivals adding to the rich­ness of our so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>On pol­i­tics, the des­ig­na­tion of a Leader of the Op­po­si­tion re­flects the larger num­ber of op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment, and that both the Govern­ment and the op­po­si­tion have roles to play to build trust in Sin­ga­pore’s pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions and achieve good out­comes for the coun­try, said the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will be open to con­struc­tive crit­i­cism, ra­tio­nal de­bate and a new way of do­ing things, while the op­po­si­tion should pro­pose pol­icy al­ter­na­tives to be scru­ti­nised and de­bated be­sides rais­ing ques­tions and crit­i­cisms, she said.</p>
    <p>“The key question is how to forge a com­mon cause to­gether, re­gard­less of our own po­lit­i­cal in­cli­na­tions,” she said. “We need to base our rhetoric on a re­spon­si­ble sense of the re­al­i­ties, and come to a shared un­der­stand­ing about our goals and con­straints.”</p>
    <p>For its part, the Govern­ment will evolve its poli­cies, recog­nis­ing that no so­lu­tions are right for all time, and will lis­ten to new ideas ob­jec­tively.</p>
    <p>But where stay­ing the course re­mains the best way for­ward, it will have to con­vince Sin­ga­pore­ans to per­se­vere. The Govern­ment must not shy away from tak­ing tough de­ci­sions in the na­tional in­ter­est, or shirk the duty of win­ning sup­port for such de­ci­sions, she added. “In all cases, we will seek to do what is best for Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans,” she said.</p>
    <p>From to­day to Fri­day, min­istries will give de­tails of their pro­grammes. Par­lia­ment will then de­bate th­ese plans and poli­cies from next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue to suc­ceed, we need to un­der­stand th­ese changes in our ex­ter­nal and do­mes­tic en­vi­ron­ments, re­think our prob­lems and im­prove on our sta­tus quo. ’’</p>
