    <p>PER­CENT­AGE OF NOR­MAL (ACA­DEMIC) STU­DENTS WHO MADE THE CUT FOR SEC­ONDARY 5 |</p>
    <p>About four in five Nor­mal (Aca­demic) stream stu­dents made the cut for pro­mo­tion to Sec­ondary 5 next year, the best per­for­mance in N-level ex­ams since 2009.</p>
    <p>Re­sults re­leased yes­ter­day by the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board showed that 77.7 per cent of Nor­mal (Aca­demic) stream stu­dents who sat the ex­ams this year did well enough to move on to the O lev­els next year – the high­est pro­por­tion since pro­mo­tion cri­te­ria were re­vised.</p>
    <p>About 7,240 of the 9,321 Sec 4 Nor­mal (Aca­demic) can­di­dates ob­tained an ag­gre­gate score not ex­ceed­ing 19 points in English lan­guage, math­e­mat­ics and the best three sub­jects, with at least a Grade 5 for all these sub­jects.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the re­vamp, pro­mo­tion was as­sessed based on English grades and a three-sub­ject score.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who sat the Nor­mal (Tech­ni­cal) ex­ams also out­per­formed their peers in pre­vi­ous years, with 98.5 per cent of the 4,156 stu­dents who took the course pass­ing, the high­est rate in the past decade.</p>
    <p>Al­most ev­ery Nor­mal (Aca­demic) stream stu­dent who sat the ex­ams this year passed, with fig­ures show­ing 99.7 per cent clear­ing the hur­dle, the high­est pro­por­tion in six years.</p>
    <p>Sec 4 Nor­mal (Aca­demic) stu­dents who ob­tained an ag­gre­gate not ex­ceed­ing 19 points in English, math­e­mat­ics and the best three sub­jects may ap­ply for the Di­rect-En­try Scheme to Polytech­nic Pro­gramme, with 1,200 places across three In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) col­leges on of­fer.</p>
    <p>They also may ap­ply for the Polytech­nic Foun­da­tion Pro­gramme – a one-year pro­gramme to pre­pare stu­dents for en­try into polytech­nic di­ploma cour­ses, with about 1,500 places avail­able.</p>
    <p>Those with Nor­mal (Tech­ni­cal) cer­tifi­cates may ap­ply to ITE or trans­fer to the Sec 4 Nor­mal (Aca­demic) course if they have ob­tained an A grade for English and math­e­mat­ics, and at least a B grade for one other sub­ject.</p>
