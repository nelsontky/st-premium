    <p>A Bri­tish court has found a 15-yearold boy, part of a group of teens who at­tacked a Sin­ga­porean stu­dent in Lon­don last Fe­bru­ary, guilty of a racist act.</p>
    <p>The ver­dict on Mon­day by the High­bury Cor­ner Youth Court comes af­ter the boy pleaded guilty in Au­gust last year to wound­ing or caus­ing grievous bod­ily harm with­out in­tent.</p>
    <p>He had chal­lenged the ac­count of Mr Jonathan Mok, 23, in the Lon­don court and said he and his friends never said “I don’t want your coro­n­avirus in my coun­try” or made any com­ments re­gard­ing Mr Mok’s eth­nic­ity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the court on Mon­day found him guilty of racially ag­gra­vated grievous bod­ily harm, con­firm­ing what the Lon­don po­lice had in­ves­ti­gated the case as since the in­ci­dent took place in Ox­ford Street in Lon­don on Feb 24 last year – a racially mo­ti­vated as­sault.</p>
    <p>Chair­man of the Bench Les­ley Ward laid out the ver­dict that the at­tack had been “un­pro­voked and racially mo­ti­vated”, af­ter Mr Mok’s tes­ti­mony that the group had spewed racist ep­i­thets dur­ing the at­tack was sup­ported by wit­nesses in the vicin­ity.</p>
    <p>She told the boy: “Given the num­ber of wit­nesses and your proxim</p>
    <p>ity to the in­ci­dent, we feel it’s not plau­si­ble that you missed the racist term be­ing used and it’s there­fore dif­fi­cult to be­lieve your ver­sion of events.”</p>
    <p>This makes the boy’s ac­tions a hate crime, which will af­fect his sen­tenc­ing at the same court on Jan 27. He has been re­leased on un­con­di­tional bail.</p>
    <p>Mr Mok is one of many of Chi­nese eth­nic­ity who were tar­geted in Europe and Amer­ica by those who linked the coro­n­avirus with the Chi­nese, es­pe­cially in the early months of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don law stu­dent had said on Face­book that he only turned around to face the group af­ter he heard them say “coro­n­avirus” as he walked past them that night.</p>
    <p>One of the group of five, which in­cluded a girl, then punched him in the face and said “I don’t want your coro­n­avirus in my coun­try” be­fore they fled. Mr Mok’s in­juries had to be treated with fa­cial surgery.</p>
    <p>His Face­book post last year on the in­ci­dent has been shared more than 20,000 times.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times then: “I thought it was im­por­tant to share and start the de­bate.</p>
    <p>“Race is­sues have been preva­lent for so long and this shows how dan­ger­ous they can be... Even when they start off ver­bally, they can es­ca­late to phys­i­cal vi­o­lence.”</p>
    <p>He had writ­ten in his post: “Why should any­one, sim­ply be­cause of the colour of their skin, be sub­jected to abuse, in any form, ver­bal or phys­i­cal? Why should I keep quiet when some­one makes a racist re­mark to­wards me.</p>
    <p>“Racism is not stu­pid­ity – racism is hate. Racists con­stantly find ex­cuses to ex­pound their ha­tred – and in this cur­rent back­drop of the coro­n­avirus, they’ve found yet an­other ex­cuse.”</p>
    <p>The Lon­don po­lice have said ear­lier that an­other boy, a 16-year-old, who was ar­rested on March 4 in con­nec­tion with the case, has been re­leased with no fur­ther ac­tion taken against him.</p>
