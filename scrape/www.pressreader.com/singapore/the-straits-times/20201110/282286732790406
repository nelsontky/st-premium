    <p>Hawker food, gro­ceries and ac­tiv­i­ties, such as ter­rar­ium work­shops, are among the more pop­u­lar pur­chases made via dig­i­tal pay­ment amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple have used DBS PayLah! for hawker food and food de­liv­er­ies, as well as to pay bills and for trans­port ser­vices, said DBS Bank head of pay­ments and plat­forms An­thony Seow. “Th­ese ar­eas make up the ev­ery­day needs of con­sumers, and re­flect cur­rent times where most of the peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore are work­ing from home or on flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Aik-Phong, man­ag­ing direc­tor for Fave Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, said the mo­bile pay­ment and deals plat­form has seen an in­crease of at least 10 per cent in all of its cat­e­gories such as food and bev­er­age (F&B), ac­tiv­i­ties, beauty and well­ness, and re­tail.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, more users have bought Fave deals and used FavePay for at­trac­tions, as travel re­stric­tions have fu­elled lo­cal tourism, said Mr Ng. Be­sides ma­jor at­trac­tions, ac­tiv­i­ties which cus­tomers can at­tend alone or in a small group – such as work­shops – have seen a 20 per cent to 25 per cent in­crease in take-up since Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>De­mand for food de­liv­er­ies on GrabFood has dou­bled since the out­break started, said a Grab spokesman. “While cer­tain cat­e­gories like fast food con­tinue to be pop­u­lar on our plat­form, we are also see­ing more con­sumers or­der from hawker cen­tre and food­court op­tions on GrabFood.”</p>
    <p>On­line pur­chases of work-fromhome items, fash­ion and ap­parel, gro­ceries and beauty prod­ucts, paid with GrabPay have also spiked.</p>
    <p>Shopee saw higher de­mand for items such as sur­gi­cal masks and hand sani­tis­ers and non-per­ish­able F&B prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, pur­chases of some types of gro­ceries, such as fresh pro­duce and frozen prod­ucts, are up 30 per cent to 100 per cent on Lazada Sin­ga­pore’s gro­cery arm RedMart.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ar­eas make up the ev­ery­day needs of con­sumers, and re­flect cur­rent times where most of the peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore are work­ing from home or on flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>DBS BANK HEAD OF PAY­MENTS AND PLAT­FORMS AN­THONY SEOW, on more peo­ple us­ing DBS PayLah! for hawker food and food de­liv­er­ies, as well as to pay bills and for trans­port ser­vices.</p>
