    <p>Protests against job law</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of In­done­sian work­ers protested yes­ter­day against a con­tro­ver­sial new job law, which crit­ics fear will favour in­vestors at the ex­pense of labour rights and the en­vi­ron­ment. Pro­test­ers ral­lied in the cap­i­tal and sev­eral other ma­jor cen­tres across the ar­chi­pel­ago against the leg­is­la­tion, which was passed on Mon­day. WORLD</p>
    <p>JAKARTA • Thou­sands of In­done­sians took to the streets of sev­eral cities yes­ter­day to protest against the pas­sage a day ear­lier of a job law they say is too pro-business, but which the gov­ern­ment has pro­moted as vi­tal to draw in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s “om­nibus” Job Cre­ation Bill was passed three days ahead of sched­ule, re­vis­ing over 70 ex­ist­ing laws to ac­cel­er­ate re­form of South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The pas­sage also came a day be­fore the start of a three-day na­tional strike which unions ex­pected to in­volve two mil­lion work­ers in protest against the Bill.</p>
    <p>Protests be­gan yes­ter­day in in­dus­trial ar­eas around Jakarta in­clud­ing Tangerang and Karawang and in Batam, home to many elec­tron­ics plants, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Kom­pas TV footage showed thou­sands of pro­test­ers in Ban­dung, West Java, wear­ing face masks but not so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>So far, pro­test­ers have been un­able to rally in front of Par­lia­ment in Jakarta as planned. Po­lice have sought to block pro­test­ers, cit­ing the need to con­tain Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The law will def­i­nitely af­fect the sta­tus of our em­ploy­ment,” said Mr An­war Sanusi, a mem­ber of FSPMI trade union in Tangerang, who took part in a rally with 400 oth­ers. Peo­ple fear los­ing pen­sions and in­sur­ance if they are made con­tract work­ers for life due to the law, he said.</p>
    <p>The law re­moves the three-year max­i­mum du­ra­tion of con­tracts and re­duces sev­er­ance ben­e­fits – pro­vi­sions the gov­ern­ment said are in­tended to pro­mote for­mal hir­ing. Other re­forms in­clude longer work­ing hours and changes to manda­tory paid leave.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian mar­kets cheered the Bill, with the main stock in­dex up as much as 1.31 per cent and the ru­piah reach­ing as high as 1.28 per cent, its strong­est in a month.</p>
    <p>Deputy Fi­nance Min­is­ter Sua­hasil Nazara, speak­ing at a bank­ing con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, said the law was meant to sup­port the business com­mu­nity “to move for­ward and cre­ate many jobs”.</p>
    <p>Citibank in a re­search note said the law sim­pli­fies business li­cens­ing and ad­dresses re­stric­tive trade and labour poli­cies. How­ever, it said im­me­di­ate for­eign in­vest­ment was un­likely in the cur­rently de­pressed global eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Trimegah Securities econ­o­mist Fakhrul Ful­vian said banks and ex­port-ori­ented industries should ben­e­fit from the law, while con­sumer and re­tail sec­tors could face pres­sure as work­ers may save more to com­pen­sate for changes i n labour rules.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many In­done­sians lashed out against the law on Twit­ter, with one trend­ing hash­tag in­cor­po­rat­ing an ex­ple­tive against Par­lia­ment and an­other call­ing law­mak­ers traitors.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian con­sti­tu­tional law ex­pert Zainal Arifin Mochtar at Gad­jah Mada Univer­sity urged Pres­i­dent Joko not to sign the Bill into law – a fi­nal step usu­ally con­sid­ered a for­mal­ity. “Many in the pub­lic re­ject it,” he said at a vir­tual news brief­ing. “I don’t think the Pres­i­dent wants to change his stance, given he was the per­son most des­per­ate for the Bill to pass. Our hope is that with this pres­sure, he will con­sider not sign­ing it.”</p>
