    <p>Tif­fany Teo held her own for 25 gru­elling min­utes, but ul­ti­mately fell short in her goal to be­come the first Sin­ga­pore-born mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) cham­pion in One Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean chal­lenged</p>
    <p>Xiong Jing­nan for the Chi­nese fighter’s women’s strawweigh­t world ti­tle at One’s In­side The Ma­trix event at the In­door Sta­dium last night, but came up short as the judges scored unan­i­mously in the de­fend­ing cham­pion’s favour at the end of the five-round bout.</p>
    <p>The pair had crossed paths once for the ti­tle be­fore, in Jakarta in Jan­uary 2018, with Xiong win­ning via a tech­ni­cal knock­out in the fourth round.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a cagey first round, both fight­ers found their range. Fol­low­ing a scram­ble, Teo al­most suc­ceeded in a kimura lock sub­mis­sion in the sec­ond round.</p>
    <p>Xiong, how­ever, man­aged to es­cape and fired off crisp punches through­out the rest of the fight. While it was not her most dom­i­nant per­for­mance, the 32-yearold Shan­dong na­tive never looked in se­ri­ous dan­ger of los­ing her ti­tle and the judges’ score­cards re­flected that.</p>
    <p>Post-fight, Teo, 30, who sported a nasty-look­ing cut on her left brow, said: “It’s kind of hard to digest (the fight) now, I have to go back and have a good look at the fight again… be­cause in the fight ev­ery­thing was done in the heat of the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Asked about her take­down in the fi­nal round, she ad­mit­ted: “Yeah, I was try­ing to set that up… in ret­ro­spect I should have got it done in an ear­lier round.”</p>
    <p>Xiong, mean­while, said: “I’m not very sat­is­fied with my per­for­mance tonight, but I’m still happy I man­aged to de­fend my ti­tle.”</p>
    <p>Teo’s bout with Xiong was one of four world ti­tle fights on the In­side The Ma­trix card, which is One’s big­gest event of the year.</p>
    <p>Two ti­tles changed hands, with Viet­namese-Amer­i­can fighter Thanh Le de­feat­ing Viet­name­seAus­tralian Martin Nguyen for the featherwei­ght ti­tle via a tech­ni­cal knock­out, and Dutch­man Reinier de Rid­der sub­mit­ting Aung La N Sang for the mid­dleweight ti­tle in the main event fight.</p>
