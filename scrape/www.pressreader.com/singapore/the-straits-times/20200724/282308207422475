    <p>A new nor­mal is in place for the world, the fash­ion in­dus­try in­cluded.</p>
    <p>This month, Paris broke from tra­di­tion in more ways than one when pre­sent­ing its men’s col­lec­tions for the Spring/Sum­mer 2021 sea­son.</p>
    <p>The city, usu­ally the last of the big four (the oth­ers be­ing London, Mi­lan and New York) on the cal­en­dar, went first this time. And it went fully dig­i­tal, tread­ing and lead­ing into the un­charted wa­ters of pre­sent­ing col­lec­tions on­line.</p>
    <p>The sea­son had a dis­tinct sense of prom­ise – that new, in­ven­tive ways of see­ing might be pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The house of Her­mes was one of the ear­li­est to present its col­lec­tions, and it did so in a bril­liantly art­ful and thought­ful way.</p>
    <p>Veronique Nicha­nian, who has stew­arded the men’s uni­verse at the house for 31 years as artis­tic di­rec­tor, works in sub­limely sub­tle shifts.</p>
    <p>This sea­son, the col­lec­tion cen­tred on care­free ex­pres­sion through light­ness and sim­plic­ity. Stream­lined, un­fussy sil­hou­ettes in blousy fab­rics, leathers made sup­ple and sen­sual – a kind of op­ti­mism to be worn.</p>
    <p>What was sur­pris­ing, though, was the de­ci­sion to part­ner play­wright and theatre di­rec­tor Cyril Teste on a short film and live per­for­mance ti­tled Hors-Champ – French for “off­screen”.</p>
    <p>Ba­si­cally, the back­stage set­ting of a fash­ion show was sim­u­lated and filmed in real time. Mod­els got dressed and handed bags and ac­ces­sories as fin­ish­ing touches.</p>
    <p>Nicha­nian strolled, tweak­ing the styling as she went: sleeves cuffed, jack­ets but­toned or zipped a cer­tain way, a shirt tucked just so.</p>
    <p>The mod­els gave them­selves a once-over in the mir­ror, then walked.</p>
    <p>It peeled back the high fa­lutin’ the­atri­cal­ity of a fash­ion show to re­veal the work in progress – cel­e­brat­ing process rather than prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Loewe made a sim­i­lar twist on a fa­mil­iar for­mat. In­stead of press notes at a phys­i­cal fash­ion show, ed­i­tors were sent a show-in-a-box.</p>
    <p>Di­vided into sec­tions in­side were: a dossier of in­for­ma­tion; ex­pen­sively printed look­books; shoes pho­tographed as post­cards; sun­glasses printed on per­fo­rated pa­per so they could be worn and tried; colour, fab­ric and tex­ture swatches; a pa­per pat­tern of one of the col­lec­tion’s key pieces; and a pop-up of an imag­ined show set, as well as a card­board record player that played the col­lec­tion’s sound­track.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing but the kitchen sink, in ef­fect. But it made for a stim­u­lat­ingly tac­tile and phys­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence in lieu of the usual run­way show.</p>
    <p>The project, con­ceived by the house’s cre­ative di­rec­tor Jonathan An­der­son with de­sign stu­dio M/M Paris, ref­er­enced in­ven­tive ex­per­i­ments like Mar­cel Duchamp’s Mu­seum in a Box.</p>
    <p>It helped, of course, that Loewe made moves in 2018 into print­ing and pub­lish­ing, se­cur­ing for it­self the re­sources and know-how to pro­duce printed work as an ex­ten­sion of the key fash­ion busi­ness.</p>
    <p>At Ber­luti, the Bel­gian cre­ative di­rec­tor Kris Van Ass­che was faced with a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Just three col­lec­tions into his ten­ure with the brand and its re­ju­ve­na­tion project, he was stymied by a pan­demic that forced the de­sign team to work from home.</p>
    <p>In the face of this dis­tance, Van Ass­che turned to the idea of con­nec­tiv­ity as an art form in the face of sep­a­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The house un­veiled its first ready-to-wear col­lab­o­ra­tion with the ex­per­i­men­tal Los An­ge­les ce­ramic artist Brian Rochefort, whose vi­brant, oozy, unc­tu­ous sculp­tures are a dar­ing buck in the face of ce­ramic tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Ber­luti is a house founded in 1895 and fa­mous for ex­pen­sive, pati­nated leather shoes – un­der Van Ass­che, it is find­ing a mod­ern voice. Old and new, tex­ture and colours, these were the threads that the two mined for di­a­logue and ex­change – fleshed out more fully in a film in which Rochefort and Van Ass­che dis­cuss their process.</p>
    <p>Col­lab­o­ra­tion has been a strong point of Kim Jones, the artis­tic di­rec­tor of Dior Men’s.</p>
    <p>Since join­ing the brand in 2018, he has worked with names like Daniel Ar­sham, Shawn Stussy, Ha­jime So­rayama, and brought on board emerg­ing tal­ents like Yoon Ahn of Am­bush and Matthew Williams of Alyx (re­cently ap­pointed to Givenchy) to de­sign jew­ellery and ac­ces­sories.</p>
    <p>Jones’ col­lec­tion this sea­son was un­der­pinned by the Ghana­ian-born, Vi­enna-trained artist Amoako Boafo who is most fa­mous for his “Black Di­as­pora” se­ries of paint­ings, which ex­plores the nu­ances of Black iden­tity, per­cep­tion and mas­culin­ity.</p>
    <p>There is im­me­di­ate trep­i­da­tion these days when a lux­ury fash­ion brand looks to Africa or Black cul­ture for in­spi­ra­tion – ap­pro­pri­a­tion has been a stub­born weak­ness.</p>
    <p>But Jones in his own child­hood moved from Ecuador to the Caribbean, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tan­za­nia, and Botswana, be­fore re­turn­ing to London to study at Saint Martins col­lege.</p>
    <p>There is some­thing to be said about an up­bring­ing steeped in broad cul­tural un­der­stand­ing and ap­pre­ci­a­tion, and it showed in this col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Boafo’s works were the cre­ative foun­da­tion, and Dior drew from it his vivid colours, graphic pat­terns, and three-di­men­sion­al­ity of the paint­ings.</p>
    <p>These ideas were re­alised as near recre­ations of some of the paint­ings, ei­ther in the styling or on fab­ric through de­tailed em­broi­dery, knit and in­tar­sia.</p>
    <p>And as with the other big brands, Dior pre­miered films to mark the col­lec­tion. The first was a quasi­doc­u­men­tary, edited and sound­tracked by the video artist Chris Cun­ning­ham, with in­ter­play­ing footage from London and Boafo’s stu­dio in Ghana.</p>
    <p>This in­tro­duced and ex­plored Boafo’s work, of­fer­ing in­sight on the na­ture of the col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond, di­rected by Jackie Nick­er­son, was an equally art­ful film that pre­sented the ac­tual col­lec­tion – the fruits of the col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The sig­nif­i­cance of this col­lab­o­ra­tion, though, is in its sin­cer­ity. As an en­deav­our both cross-cul­tural and in­evitably linked to com­merce, it nev­er­the­less shone be­cause of the re­spect that Dior showed its col­lab­o­ra­tor.</p>
    <p>It did not stink of to­kenism – the French house has com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing the work of young artists by spon­sor­ing Boafo’s art res­i­dency in Ghana – but of a level of ex­cel­lence and in­tegrity that, though rare, can ev­i­dently be up­held.</p>
    <p>Which is a new nor­mal to look for­ward to.</p>
