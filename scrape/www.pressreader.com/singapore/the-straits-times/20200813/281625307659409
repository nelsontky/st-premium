    <p>A num­ber of projects in the mega Build-To-Or­der (BTO) sales ex­er­cise yes­ter­day may take up to five years to com­plete due to safety mea­sures in­tro­duced at con­struc­tion sites to curb Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Hous­ing Board said home buy­ers keen on the 1,785-unit Ur­banVille @ Wood­lands project, a five-minute walk from Wood­lands MRT sta­tion, will have to wait the long­est, at around 62 months. It is slated to be com­pleted in the sec­ond quar­ter of 2026.</p>
    <p>The 1,070-unit Costa Grove in Pasir Ris will take be­tween 56 and 58 months, with an es­ti­mated com­ple­tion date in end-2025.</p>
    <p>The 472 flats in Bis­han and 1,044 flats in Parc Res­i­dences @ Ten­gah have an es­ti­mated wait­ing time of be­tween 52 and 54 months, to be ready around the sec­ond or third quar­ter of 2025.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee ac­knowl­edged in a Face­book post that some of the projects will have a “longer than nor­mal” com­ple­tion time­line, which may be of con­cern to buy­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “While projects may take longer than nor­mal to com­plete, I have asked HDB to see how we can re­duce the length of the de­lays where pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>He added that meet­ing hous­ing needs aside, the safety of con­struc­tion work­ers is also im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“To re­duce the risk of a resur­gence of Covid-19 at con­struc­tion sites, we have cal­i­brated the restart of con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties, and re­quired that build­ing con­trac­tors ad­here to safe man­age­ment mea­sures,” said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>He urged those with ur­gent hous­ing needs to con­sider pur­chas­ing a flat in the re­sale mar­ket, not­ing that first-time buy­ers may re­ceive up to $160,000 in hous­ing grants.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 7,862 flats in 11 hous­ing projects spread across eight towns are be­ing of­fered for sale, mak­ing it the big­gest sales ex­er­cise by the HDB this year.</p>
    <p>Tech­ni­cal sup­port ex­ec­u­tive Muham­mad Nazirul, 29, had planned to ap­ply for Ur­banVille @ Wood­lands but the long wait has him and his fi­ancee relook­ing their op­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “Af­ter we get mar­ried ei­ther next year or in early 2022, we may have to rent a home for a few years while we wait for a home. The rent we pay could be saved for ren­o­va­tion costs for the new flat, so we’ll need to dis­cuss fur­ther if we want to ap­ply for a unit there.”</p>
