    <p>PARIS • Parisians and hol­i­day­mak­ers strolling along the banks of the River Seine or brows­ing open-air mar­kets in Paris must wear a face mask from to­day, af­ter the au­thor­i­ties im­posed new mea­sures to curb a rise in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The or­der, which ap­plies to peo­ple aged 11 and over, cov­ers busy out­door ar­eas in the French cap­i­tal, although tourist sites such as the Eif­fel Tower, the Arc de Tri­om­phe and Champs-El­y­sees boule­vard were not listed.</p>
    <p>Data showed the virus had be­gun cir­cu­lat­ing more widely in Paris and its lower-in­come sub­urbs since the mid­dle of last month.</p>
    <p>The rate of pos­i­tive tests in the greater Paris re­gion now stands at 2.4 per cent, com­pared with a na­tional av­er­age of 1.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Af­ter tough lock­down mea­sures slowed in­fec­tion rates, many Euro­pean coun­tries are watch­ing new clus­ters flare up af­ter eas­ing curbs to try to limit the eco­nomic dam­age and al­le­vi­ate public frus­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>France has made it com­pul­sory to wear a face mask in closed public spa­ces such as shops and banks since July 21, and Paris joins a grow­ing list of cities or­der­ing peo­ple to wear masks in busy zones out­doors, in­clud­ing Toulouse, Lille and Biar­ritz.</p>
    <p>Those breach­ing the or­der face a fine of €135 (S$220).</p>
    <p>The penalty rises to six months in prison for any­one vi­o­lat­ing it more than three times in a month.</p>
    <p>The Paris or­der will last a month. The num­ber of peo­ple in France in­fected with the coro­n­avirus rose by 2,288 last Friday, a new post­lock­down high.</p>
    <p>Mean­while in Bel­gium, re­sort towns on the Bel­gian coast an­nounced mea­sures yes­ter­day to turn away day trip­pers af­ter beach fights broke out be­tween the po­lice and youth told to leave for re­fus­ing to re­spect coro­n­avirus safety mea­sures.</p>
