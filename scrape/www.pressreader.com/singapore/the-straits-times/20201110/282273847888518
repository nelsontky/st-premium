    <p>HONG KONG • China’s move to halt Ant Group’s mas­sive stock de­but could re­duce the fin­tech giant’s value by as much as US$140 bil­lion (S$188 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to an­a­lysts’ re­vised es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>New reg­u­la­tions that could force Ant to raise more cap­i­tal to back lend­ing and seek national li­cences to op­er­ate across the coun­try may re­duce the firm’s val­u­a­tion by about half, ac­cord­ing to es­ti­mates from Morn­ingstar and other firms.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tory de­tails are pre­lim­i­nary and could be sub­ject to change.</p>
    <p>If Ant’s US$280 bil­lion pre-IPO val­u­a­tion is halved, it would es­sen­tially mean the com­pany is worth less than what it was two years ago, when it raised money from some of the world’s largest funds in­clud­ing War­burg Pin­cus, Sil­ver Lake Man­age­ment and Te­masek.</p>
    <p>The re­duced val­u­a­tion also means po­ten­tially lower fees for in­vest­ment banks, like China In­ter­na­tional Cap­i­tal, that were count­ing on a wind­fall from Ant’s record-set­ting IPO. And it gives bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s firm less heft to carry out ac­qui­si­tions as it looks to ex­pand be­yond its Chi­nese base and take the fight do­mes­ti­cally to Ten­cent.</p>
    <p>In a dras­tic turn of events, China put the brakes last week on Ant’s US$37 bil­lion share sale just days be­fore the fin­tech jug­ger­naut was due to go pub­lic in Shang­hai and Hong Kong. The move up­ends what had been one of China’s big­gest busi­ness suc­cess stories.</p>
    <p>Morn­ingstar an­a­lyst Iris Tan said that Ant could face a 25 per cent-50 per cent down­side in val­u­a­tion, if its pre-IPO price-to-book ra­tio drops to around the level of top global banks. That means its val­u­a­tion could be slashed by about US$140 bil­lion. Cur­rently Ant’s stock price is val­ued at 4.4 times of its book value, ver­sus two times at those banks, she added.</p>
    <p>Mr San­jay Jain, Sin­ga­pore-based head of fi­nan­cials at Aletheia Cap­i­tal, es­ti­mates that Ant’s price-toearn­ings ra­tio could drop to about 10 times its lend­ing prof­its, half of the pre­vi­ous tar­get it had as­signed to the com­pany. The new price would put the fin­tech giant more in line with val­u­a­tions of some of the bet­ter-qual­ity banks.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group is trad­ing at about eight times for­ward 12-month earn­ings, while DBS Group of Sin­ga­pore is trad­ing at about 12.6 times. China Mer­chants Bank, among the coun­try’s big­gest re­tail lenders, trades at about 10 times.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Ant de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>SUM­MONED TO BEI­JING</p>
    <p>Mr Ma was sum­moned by Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors for “su­per­vi­sory in­ter­views” days be­fore Ant’s pro­posed trad­ing de­but and the au­thor­i­ties an­nounced that they had be­lat­edly dis­cov­ered an ar­ray of short­com­ings that, by some ac­counts, might re­quire Ant to be over­hauled.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­posed new rules, the com­pany would need ad­di­tional cap­i­tal to meet more strin­gent reg­u­la­tory de­mands.</p>
    <p>On­line lend­ing com­pa­nies like Ant could be re­quired to pro­vide at least 30 per cent of fund­ing for loans, ac­cord­ing to draft rules pro­posed by bank­ing reg­u­la­tors this month. Cur­rently only about 2 per cent of loans sit on Ant’s bal­ance sheet, with the bulk of fund­ing com­ing from bank part­ners.</p>
    <p>If those rules are passed, to sup­port its nearly 1.8 tril­lion yuan (S$367 bil­lion) of loans out­stand­ing, Ant needs to un­der­write 540 bil­lion yuan of credit on its own, ac­cord­ing to Morn­ingstar. Based on how small loan com­pa­nies can only lever­age as much as five times, Ant’s credit units Huabei and Jiebei could be need­ing at least 54 bil­lion yuan, it said.</p>
    <p>“When it re­turns, in­vestors will likely look at Ant a bit less like a tech com­pany than be­fore given it will be less as­set-light, and growth as­sump­tions may be lower,” said Mr Kevin Kwek, a Sin­ga­pore-based an­a­lyst with Bern­stein. “A dis­count on pre­vi­ous val­u­a­tions might set in given the reg­u­la­tory over­hang.”</p>
    <p>Ant was sit­ting on about 80 bil­lion yuan of cash as at the end of June. The cap­i­tal re­quire­ment is also ex­pected to have a three-year grace pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In or­der for Ant to meet some of the reg­u­la­tory de­mands, one of the more re­al­is­tic so­lu­tions would be for af­fil­i­ate Alibaba Group to in­ject 20 bil­lion to 40 bil­lion yuan, said Mr Leon Qi, a Hong Kong-based an­a­lyst with Daiwa Cap­i­tal Mar­kets.</p>
    <p>If Ant’s US$280 bil­lion (S$376 bil­lion) pre-IPO val­u­a­tion is halved, it would es­sen­tially mean the com­pany is worth less than what it was two years ago when it raised money from some of the world’s largest funds in­clud­ing War­burg Pin­cus, Sil­ver Lake Man­age­ment and Te­masek.</p>
