    <p>MUMBAI • Bil­lion­aire Mukesh Am­bani oblit­er­ated his ri­vals in In­dia’s telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions sec­tor by sell­ing US$2 (S$2.70) data plans and free voice calls. Four years later, he is us­ing a very sim­i­lar tac­tic – cut­throat pric­ing – to gain an edge in the coun­try’s in­creas­ingly com­pet­i­tive e-com­merce space.</p>
    <p>As In­dia this week hits the peak of its big­gest shop­ping sea­son – the fes­ti­val of Deep­avali – the ty­coon’s re­tail web­sites, in­clud­ing JioMart, are el­bow­ing their way into a space long dom­i­nated by Ama­zon.com and Walmart’s lo­cal unit Flip­kart On­line Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Ratch­et­ing up the com­pe­ti­tion, Mr Am­bani’s por­tals are of­fer­ing block­buster dis­counts of as much as 50 per cent on popular sug­ary con­fec­tions and other holiday sta­ples such as spice mixes.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, his Re­liance Dig­i­tal web­site is sell­ing some flag­ship Sam­sung smart­phones at prices lower than those of ri­vals, with re­bates of as much as 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>It is a push that comes as Mr Am­bani’s sprawl­ing con­glom­er­ate, Re­liance In­dus­tries, is flush with cash. Af­ter rais­ing an eye-pop­ping US$20 bil­lion for its tech ven­ture, it has shifted fund rais­ing to its re­tail arm, which has won more than US$6 bil­lion in in­vest­ment in re­cent weeks from heavy­weights like KKR & Co and Sil­ver Lake.</p>
    <p>With Re­liance Re­tail al­ready In­dia’s big­gest brick-and-mor­tar re­tailer, Mr Am­bani’s on­line am­bi­tions pit him against the two United States gi­ants, Ama­zon and Walmart, both of which have made big in­vest­ments in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The coun­try, one of the last big con­sumer mar­kets, is still up for grabs, and Mor­gan Stan­ley es­ti­mates In­dia will gen­er­ate US$200 bil­lion in e-com­merce sales by 2026.</p>
    <p>Yet, Mr Am­bani’s tri­umphs in telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions – where he be­gan as a tiny player but out­paced es­tab­lished ri­vals by un­der­cut­ting them on price and cap­i­tal­is­ing on reg­u­la­tory changes – are a cau­tion­ary tale for the Amer­i­can gi­ants.</p>
    <p>In re­tail, Mr Am­bani’s com­pany has a huge edge: Gov­ern­ment poli­cies are in­creas­ingly stacked in favour of do­mes­tic re­tail­ers, of which Re­liance is the largest.</p>
    <p>Since the end of 2018, In­dia’s for­eign in­vest­ment rules have also barred Ama­zon and Flip­kart from fea­tur­ing ex­clu­sive prod­ucts and own­ing in­ven­tory, in a bid to restrict their abil­ity to di­rectly in­flu­ence prices and of­fer dis­counts.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies are not al­lowed to own more than 51 per cent of lo­cal brick-and-mor­tar su­per­mar­ket chains. Even that limit is sub­ject to con­di­tions such as set­ting up only in cities with pop­u­la­tions of less than one mil­lion.</p>
    <p>With his lo­cal strat­egy, low-cost pro­cure­ment and chain of brickand-mor­tar stores, Mr Am­bani can shake up on­line re­tail, said chief ex­pe­ri­ence of­fi­cer Siju Narayan of RexEmp­tor Con­sult in Mumbai.</p>
    <p>“JioMart can dent the for­tunes of gro­cery e-com­merce ma­jors like BigBas­ket and Gro­fers,” he said, re­fer­ring to In­dia’s big­gest on­line gro­cers. “And (it can) im­pact the gro­cery, home and per­sonal care cat­e­gories of e-tail ma­jors like Ama­zon and Flip­kart in the com­ing days.”</p>
    <p>The stakes are high for the Amer­i­can re­tail­ers. Mr Jeff Be­zos, Ama­zon’s hard-charg­ing founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive, has pledged to in</p>
    <p>vest US$6.5 bil­lion in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Walmart spent US$16 bil­lion in 2018 to ac­quire In­dian por­tal Flip­kart in its big­gest deal. It has in­vested more than US$1 bil­lion this year in the e-tailer and steadily ploughed cash into its sis­ter unit, pay­ments ser­vice PhonePe.</p>
    <p>But for Mr Am­bani, 63, Asia’s rich­est man with a net worth of US$78 bil­lion, the e-com­merce push may turn out to be tougher than telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The wire­less op­er­a­tors he de­feated were mostly home-grown play­ers lack­ing the heft, ex­pe­ri­ence and deep pock­ets of Ama­zon or Walmart. Also, his group’s ecom­merce web­sites are newer than those of its ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Yet, get­ting it right is key be­cause Mr Am­bani has cast re­tail and tech as the fu­ture of Re­liance, which had its start in tex­tiles un­der his fa­ther and pro­gressed into petro­chem­i­cals and oil re­fin­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­liance is al­ready In­dia’s big­gest com­pany and its mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of US$185 bil­lion equals about 6.6 per cent of In­dia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>To ce­ment his po­si­tion as the na­tion’s No. 1 re­tailer, Mr Am­bani bought the re­tail, whole­sale, lo­gis­tics and ware­hous­ing units of Fu­ture Group for US$3.4 bil­lion in Au­gust. Ama­zon, which owns a tiny stake in an un­listed firm un­der the Fu­ture Group, has sought to block the sale in an ar­bi­tra­tion court.</p>
    <p>“It’s a head-on com­pe­ti­tion in on­line re­tail,” said Mr De­vang­shu Dutta, chief ex­ec­u­tive of re­tail con­sul­tancy Third Eye­sight. “An ex­tremely well cap­i­talised, very ag­gres­sive player is the new chal­lenger.”</p>
    <p>With Re­liance Re­tail al­ready In­dia’s big­gest brick-and-mor­tar re­tailer, Mr Mukesh Am­bani’s on­line am­bi­tions pit him against the two United States gi­ants, Ama­zon and Walmart, both of which have made big in­vest­ments in In­dia.</p>
