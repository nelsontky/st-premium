    <p>LON­DON • Gold’s spot and fu­tures prices opened the week by hit­ting record highs, with the metal for im­me­di­ate de­liv­ery clos­ing i n on US$2,000 an ounce as the search for safe-haven as­sets con­tin­ued amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Spot bul­lion surged 11 per cent last month, the big­gest monthly gain since 2012, as i nvestors weighed a weaker US dol­lar and record low real yields in the United States. Strate­gists are now con­sid­er­ing al­ter­na­tives to gov­ern­ment debt, such as cash, credit, div­i­dend shares and gold.</p>
    <p>RBC Cap­i­tal Mar­kets said gold seems like a “freight train” as in­vestors have gone “haven hunt­ing”.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has prompted un­prece­dented amounts of stim­u­lus be­ing un­leashed to shore up economies, in­clud­ing lower rates, which are a boon for non-in­ter­estyield­ing gold.</p>
    <p>Sim­mer­ing geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions are also boost­ing de­mand – US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion will an­nounce mea­sures shortly against “a broad ar­ray” of Chi­nese-owned soft­ware deemed to pose US na­tional se­cu­rity risks.</p>
    <p>“The fall in US 10-year real yields was the most im­por­tant driver in our view given the strong in­verse re­la­tion­ship,” Com­mon­wealth Bank of Aus­tralia an­a­lyst Vivek Dhar said in a note. “Safe-haven de­mand pri­mar­ily re­flected global growth con­cerns linked to ris­ing Covid-19 cases around the world and es­ca­lat­ing US-China ten­sions.”</p>
    <p>Spot gold rose as much as 0.6 per cent to US$1,988.40 an ounce, while most ac­tive fu­tures traded as high as US$2,009.50 on the Comex.</p>
    <p>Global Covid-19 cases have sur­passed 18 mil­lion as the pan­demic is now adding a mil­lion in­fec­tions every four days.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s Vic­to­ria state tight­ened re­stric­tions and de­clared a state of dis­as­ter, while the Philip­pines reim­posed a l ock­down in Manila. Fed­eral Re­serve Bank of Min­neapo­lis pres­i­dent Neel Kashkari sug­gested a lock­down of four to six weeks for the US.</p>
    <p>More gains are seen for gold as the path to eco­nomic re­cov­ery re­mains un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>RBC Cap­i­tal Mar­kets said prices may top US$3,000 should the global sit­u­a­tion de­te­ri­o­rate ma­te­ri­ally, with that out­look rep­re­sent­ing its bull-case sce­nario, which has a 40 per cent prob­a­bil­ity. In its base­case view, which has 50 per cent odds, prices will pass US$2,000 in the com­ing quar­ters.</p>
