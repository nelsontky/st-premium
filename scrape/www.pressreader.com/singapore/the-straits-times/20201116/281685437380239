    <p>Sin­ga­pore firms will find it eas­ier and cheaper to do business in the re­gion when the newly inked re­gion-wide free trade pact takes ef­fect, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters after sign­ing the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP), Mr Chan said the agree­ment pro­vides busi­nesses with bet­ter in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion and en­ables them to con­sol­i­date their pro­duc­tion across par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries, lead­ing to sav­ings in cost and time.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect the RCEP coun­tries to of­fer them­selves as an in­te­grated mar­ket for in­vest­ment, es­pe­cially at a time when the global sup­ply chains and global pro­duc­tion chains are be­ing reshuf­fled be­cause of tech­nol­ogy and geopol­i­tics,” he added.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers, too, will see ben­e­fits with a more com­pet­i­tive range of prod­ucts to choose from, as well as cost sav­ings passed down from the elim­i­na­tion of tar­iffs on most goods among mem­bers, he said.</p>
    <p>The RCEP was signed vir­tu­ally by all 10 Asean mem­bers and key part­ners Aus­tralia, China, Ja­pan, South Korea and New Zealand on the last day of the an­nual year-end Asean Sum­mit hosted by Viet­nam, which also handed over the ro­tat­ing Asean chair­man­ship to Brunei.</p>
    <p>To­gether, the RCEP coun­tries ac­count for 30 per cent of the global econ­omy and one-third of the world’s pop­u­la­tion. Sin­ga­pore’s trade value with the 14 other RCEP mem­bers has grown steadily over the years, reach­ing 50.4 per cent, or $515.2 bil­lion, of the Repub­lic’s global trade last year.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment’s key ben­e­fits in­clude tar­iff elim­i­na­tion for at least 92 per cent of goods traded among mem­bers, and al­low­ing busi­nesses to in­vest in fel­low RCEP coun­tries with­out hav­ing to meet con­di­tional per­for­mance re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, busi­nesses han­dling chem­i­cals, plas­tics and pro­cessed food could see cost sav­ings for their ex­ports, es­pe­cially to China, Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Ex­press con­sign­ments and per­ish­able goods also have to be cleared by Cus­toms within six hours of ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Non-tra­di­tional ar­eas which are not in some ex­ist­ing trade pacts, such as e-com­merce, com­pe­ti­tion pol­icy and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, are also in­cluded in the RCEP.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, con­sumers’ per­sonal data will be pro­tected when shop­ping or car­ry­ing out ac­tiv­i­ties on­line, and cross-bor­der elec­tronic sig­na­tures and trans­ac­tions more widely ac­cepted.</p>
    <p>The pact also pro­vides for en­hanced in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion and en­force­ment. For ex­am­ple, Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies need only file a sin­gle patent or trade­mark ap­pli­ca­tion that would ap­ply in other RCEP mem­ber coun­tries.</p>
    <p>There will also be greater clar­ity and trans­parency for firms seek­ing gov­ern­ment projects, with mem­bers agree­ing to pub­lish laws, reg­u­la­tions and pro­ce­dures on such op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>RCEP mem­bers are also obliged to share in­for­ma­tion that may be rel­e­vant to small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises so that they can ben­e­fit from the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>As for con­cerns some have raised about ben­e­fits be­ing tilted in favour of larger economies, like China, Mr Chan said the RCEP will bring about mu­tual ben­e­fits for both Chi­nese com­pa­nies ven­tur­ing be­yond the do­mes­tic mar­ket, as well as for non-Chi­nese com­pa­nies who want to en­ter China.</p>
    <p>It will also al­low for both the Chi­nese and re­gional mar­kets to be seen as an in­te­grated mar­ket, mak­ing the group­ing more at­trac­tive to global in­vestors, and boost the com­pet­i­tive­ness of its ex­ports to the rest of the world, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan de­scribed the RCEP as an im­por­tant geostrate­gic ini­tia­tive that will fur­ther re­gional eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion, adding that its sign­ing is a timely boost to the re­gion’s longer-term prospects.</p>
    <p>“It will place the re­gion at the fore­front of the global eco­nomic re­cov­ery and re­main as an at­trac­tive</p>
    <p>IN­TE­GRATED MAR­KET</p>
    <p>We ex­pect the RCEP coun­tries to of­fer them­selves as an in­te­grated mar­ket for in­vest­ment, es­pe­cially at a time when the global sup­ply chains and global pro­duc­tion chains are be­ing reshuf­fled be­cause of tech­nol­ogy and geopol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>MR CHAN CHUN SING, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter, on the RCEP agree­ment.</p>
    <p>PREF­ER­EN­TIAL TAR­IFFS</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ers will ben­e­fit from be­ing able to qual­ify for pref­er­en­tial tar­iffs more eas­ily. This will boost op­por­tu­ni­ties for sup­ply chain di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE BUSINESS FED­ER­A­TION, on how the trade pact will ben­e­fit busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion dur­ing and post-Covid-19,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also urged mem­bers to ac­cel­er­ate ef­forts to rat­ify the RCEP, and keep the agree­ment rel­e­vant in line with chang­ing re­al­i­ties and evolv­ing business needs.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Business Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit said the RCEP will en­hance re­gional trade, which is key for Sin­ga­pore’s open ex­port-ori­ented econ­omy. “Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies will be able to make use of re­gional cu­mu­la­tion to en­joy greater flex­i­bil­ity in sourc­ing from a larger pool of sup­pli­ers in the re­gion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The pact’s re­gional cu­mu­la­tion pro­vi­sions al­low busi­nesses to in­clude the use of raw ma­te­ri­als and parts sourced from any of the other 14 RCEP mar­kets as con­tent orig­i­nat­ing here.</p>
    <p>“Man­u­fac­tur­ers will ben­e­fit from be­ing able to qual­ify for pref­er­en­tial tar­iffs more eas­ily,” said the SBF in a state­ment. “This will boost op­por­tu­ni­ties for sup­ply chain di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>In a joint lead­ers’ state­ment yes­ter­day, the RCEP coun­tries said they are ex­pe­dit­ing their do­mes­tic pro­cesses so that they can rat­ify the agree­ment, and will de­velop the RCEP as a plat­form for di­a­logue and co­op­er­a­tion on trade and eco­nomic is­sues af­fect­ing the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The RCEP will come into force once six Asean coun­tries and three part­ners have rat­i­fied the pact.</p>
