    <p>•</p>
    <p>VAL­DOSTA (Ge­or­gia) US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump cam­paigned in Ge­or­gia on Satur­day for two Repub­li­can sen­a­tors at a rally that some in his party feared could end up hurt­ing, not help­ing, their chances by fo­cus­ing on his ef­forts to re­verse his own elec­tion de­feat.</p>
    <p>In his first rally ap­pear­ance since he l ost to Demo­crat Joe Bi­den in the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial con­test, Mr Trump urged the crowd to vote for Repub­li­can can­di­dates in the Ge­or­gia run-off elec­tion on Jan 5 de­spite his un­sub­stan­ti­ated claims of sig­nif­i­cant elec­toral fraud in the state.</p>
    <p>But he gave con­sid­er­able time in his re­marks to al­le­ga­tions, made with­out ev­i­dence, of wide­spread fraud in the na­tion­wide elec­tion that led to a Demo­crat re­claim­ing the White House. Mr Trump has de­clined to con­cede the race.</p>
    <p>“They cheated and they rigged our pres­i­den­tial elec­tion but we will still win it,” Mr Trump said. “And they’re go­ing to try and rig this elec­tion too,” Mr Trump, a Repub­li­can, told the crowd, who chanted “Four More Years!”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump re­peated his at­tacks on Repub­li­cans who have re­fused to back his claims, in­clud­ing Ge­or­gia Gover­nor Brian Kemp.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Satur­day, Mr Trump phoned Mr Kemp and pres­sured the gover­nor on Twit­ter to take fur­ther steps to help him over­turn the elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s al­le­ga­tions of wide­spread voter fraud have been re­jected by state and fed­eral of­fi­cials across the United States, and his cam­paign’s nu­mer­ous le­gal chal­lenges have al­most all failed.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is the first Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date to win in Ge­or­gia since 1992. Statewide re­counts, in­clud­ing a painstak­ing re­view by hand of some five mil­lion bal­lots, turned up no sig­nif­i­cant ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Jan­uary run-offs pit Repub­li­can sen­a­tors David Per­due and Kelly Lo­ef­fler against well-funded Demo­cratic chal­lengers Jon Os­soff and Raphael Warnock, who are seek­ing to cap­ture a state that has not elected a Demo­cratic sen­a­tor in 20 years.</p>
    <p>The races will de­ter­mine which party con­trols the US Se­nate. Democrats, who al­ready have the ma­jor­ity in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, need to win both seats to con­trol the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>If Repub­li­cans win one seat, they will re­tain their ma­jor­ity and be able to block much of Mr Bi­den’s leg­isla­tive agenda.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said he would visit Ge­or­gia to cam­paign for the Demo­cratic can­di­dates but did not give a timetable for his trip.</p>
    <p>Gover­nor Kemp did not at­tend the rally due to the death of close fam­ily friend Har­ri­son Deal. He had an ex­change with Mr Trump on Twit­ter ear­lier in the day, how­ever.</p>
    <p>“I will eas­ily & quickly win Ge­or­gia if Gover­nor #Bri­anKem­pGA or the Secretary of State per­mit a sim­ple sig­na­ture ver­i­fi­ca­tion ... Why are these two ‘Repub­li­cans’ saying no?” Mr Trump wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Mr Kemp re­sponded that he had “pub­licly called for a sig­na­ture au­dit three times”, Mr Trump said that was not good enough, and added that Mr Kemp should im­me­di­ately call a spe­cial ses­sion of the state leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>“Your peo­ple are re­fus­ing to do what you ask. What are they hid­ing?” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>In a move un­prece­dented in mod­ern US his­tory, the Trump team has tried, with­out suc­cess, to get Repub­li­can-con­trolled leg­is­la­tures in bat­tle­ground states won by Mr Bi­den to set aside the elec­tion re­sults and de­clare Mr Trump the win­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den won the elec­tion with 306 Elec­toral Col­lege votes – more than the 270 re­quired – to Mr Trump’s 232.</p>
    <p>The Elec­toral Col­lege will meet on Dec 14 to for­malise the out­come. REUTERS</p>
