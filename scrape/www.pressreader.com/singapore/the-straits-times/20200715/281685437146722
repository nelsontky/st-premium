    <p>The po­si­tion of labour chief has been held by a Cabi­net min­is­ter for the last four decades.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Chee Onn – who took over the top NTUC post from Mr De­van Nair – was a Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party MP when he be­came Na­tional Trades Union Congress sec­re­tary-gen­eral in 1979. He was ap­pointed min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice in 1980.</p>
    <p>Suc­ceed­ing Mr Lim as NTUC sec­re­tary-gen­eral in 1983 was Mr Ong Teng Cheong, who con­tin­ued as labour chief when he be­came deputy prime min­is­ter in 1985. He stepped down in 1993 to con­test the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, and was pres­i­dent un­til 1999.</p>
    <p>The next three labour chiefs – Mr Lim Boon Heng (1993-2006), Mr Lim Swee Say (2007-2015) and Mr Chan Chun Sing (2015-2018) – were also min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Chee Meng was min­is­ter for ed­u­ca­tion (schools) and sec­ond min­is­ter for trans­port when he and Dr Koh Poh Koon – who is cur­rently Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try – were co-opted into NTUC in April 2018 as deputy sec­re­taries­gen­eral. Mr Ng was elected to the top post on May 22, 2018, tak­ing over from Mr Chan, who be­came Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, at NTUC’s Na­tional Del­e­gates’ Con­fer­ence, held once every four years, union del­e­gates elected a 21-mem­ber cen­tral com­mit­tee, and Mr Ng and NTUC pres­i­dent Mary Liew were cho­sen as lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh, who was elected as an MP for Tampines GRC last Fri­day, and Ms Cham Hui Fong, a for­mer Nom­i­nated MP, are deputy sec­re­taries-gen­eral. Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence Heng Chee How, an MP for Jalan Be­sar GRC, was co-opted last year as a third deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral.</p>
