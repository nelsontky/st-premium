    <p>•</p>
    <p>Lazio coach Si­mone In­za­ghi has re­vealed he had only 13 play­ers avail­able due to in­juries and Covid-19 cases for their 1-1 away draw with Zenit St Peters­burg in the Cham­pi­ons League on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“It is very sat­is­fy­ing to have a group like this and it is dif­fi­cult to ask for more,” said the Ital­ian, who faced an iden­ti­cal prob­lem at Bel­gium’s Club Brugge a week ago in Group F but got the same re­sult.</p>
    <p>“We played the last two Cham­pi­ons League away games with 13 play­ers; this morn­ing (de­fender) Luiz Felipe was also hav­ing trou­ble walk­ing but we are go­ing be­yond all ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s frus­trat­ing to be in these con­di­tions, it’s very dif­fi­cult and we hope to get some play­ers back.”</p>
    <p>Lazio said be­fore they left Italy, sev­eral mem­bers of their squad had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>They were not named but goal­keeper Thomas Strakosha, mid­fielder Lu­cas Leiva and lead­ing scorer and European Golden Shoe win­ner Ciro Im­mo­bile were among those who stayed be­hind.</p>
    <p>Uefa’s of­fi­cial line-up showed 22 play­ers in the Lazio squad that trav­elled to Rus­sia although at least half a dozen were from the youth team.</p>
    <p>There has since been con­fu­sion over the tests con­ducted by Uefa and Serie A as Im­mo­bile and Leiva were miss­ing against Brugge and Zenit yet played in a Serie A match away to Torino in be­tween.</p>
    <p>The duo, along with Strakosha, who was on the bench at Torino, were al­lowed to fea­ture as their swab tests were neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion (FIGC) on Tues­day opened an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Lazio over po­ten­tial vi­o­la­tions of Covid-19 pro­to­cols when car­ry­ing out testing.</p>
    <p>It in­spected Lazio’s sport cen­tre near Rome, seiz­ing the re­sults of swab tests on play­ers, and has re­quested an ex­pla­na­tion from the Ital­ian club’s man­age­ment, in­clud­ing owner and pres­i­dent Clau­dio Lotito and medic Ivo Pul­cini.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ital­ian daily Cor­riere dello Sport, Torino have also asked the FIGC to get to the bot­tom of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>News­pa­per La Gazzetta dello Sport claims that if found guilty, the penal­ties “range from fines, penal­ties, rel­e­ga­tion to last place and even ex­clu­sion from the cham­pi­onship”.</p>
    <p>It added: “The se­ri­ous­ness of the vi­o­la­tion is as­sessed ac­cord­ing to the health risk for play­ers, staff, ref­er­ees and all pro­fes­sion­als ex­posed to the in­fec­tion from Covid-19 as well as the ‘as­cer­tained in­ten­tion to al­ter the course or the re­sult of a match of com­pe­ti­tion’.”</p>
    <p>But be­fore Wed­nes­day’s fix­ture, Lazio’s sport­ing di­rec­tor Igli Tare said the club had acted in good faith and col­lab­o­rated fully with the FIGC, be­fore sug­gest­ing there was a dif­fer­ence be­tween Serie A testing and the tests done by Uefa.</p>
    <p>“There’s some­thing that’s not right,” he told Sky Sport Italia. “In my opin­ion, we need uni­for­mity, only in this way can we move for­ward. Oth­er­wise, we will be here dis­cussing this ev­ery week.”</p>
    <p>Cor­riere dello Sport said that the N gene was de­tected in Im­mo­bile’s swab test, with Uefa de­ter­min­ing that di­ag­no­sis as Covid­pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Lazio con­sider the N gene to be part of the coro­n­avirus fam­ily but sep­a­rate from Covid-19, and Lotito is threat­en­ing to hit Uefa with a “pos­si­ble law­suit” for ex­clud­ing Strakosha, Leiva and Im­mo­bile.</p>

There has been con&#xAD;fu&#xAD;sion over Covid test re&#xAD;sults as Uefa guide&#xAD;lines are stricter than those which Serie A uses.</p>
