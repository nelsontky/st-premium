    <p>The cur­rent cure rate is about 70 per cent. Hope­fully, we can in­crease the num­ber to 80 per cent or more [and] fo­cus on the [...] pa­tients who still don’t re­spond to any treat­ments.</p>
    <p>Dr Daryl Tan Chen Lung, Hae­ma­tol­o­gist</p>
    <p>T o keep you healthy from day to day, your body has its own in-built, germ-fight­ing net­work.</p>
    <p>This net­work is also known as the lym­phatic sys­tem, made up of dif­fer­ent ves­sels and or­gans i n your body, from the l ymph nodes to the bone mar­row. Lym­phoma is the name of the can­cer that af­fects this sys­tem.</p>
    <p>There are many types of lym­phoma but Dif­fuse Large B-Cell Lym­phoma (DLBCL) is the most com­mon ag­gres­sive type of non-Hodgkin lym­phoma, af­fect­ing the B-lym­pho­cytes that pro­duce an­ti­bod­ies which help your body fight i nfec­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­ga­ni­za­tion’s guid­ance on clas­si­fy­ing tu­mours, DLBCL ac­counts for 30 to 40 per cent of newly di­ag­nosed cases of</p>
    <p>1 non-Hodgkin lym­phoma glob­ally.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, Dr Daryl Tan Chen Lung, who spe­cialises in haema­tol­ogy and prac­tises at Mount El­iz­a­beth Hos­pi­tals, es­ti­mates that lym­phoma is the fifth most com­mon can­cer in Sin­ga­pore. 2</p>
    <p>Keep­ing an eye out for symp­toms</p>
    <p>Un­like other can­cer pa­tients, DLBCL pa­tients hardly have any con­tribut­ing fac­tors to the devel­op­ment of the con­di­tion — not even hered­i­tary ones — though peo­ple with ex­ist­ing HIV in­fec­tions are more prone to get­ting DLBCL.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult of this, and also be­cause lym­phoma is less com­mon than other can­cers like breast or lung can­cer, reg­u­lar med­i­cal check-ups do not test for its ge­netic in­di­ca­tors. In­stead, pa­tients seek med­i­cal help only when they spot early symp­toms, says Dr Tan. A grow­ing aware­ness of lym­phoma — World Lym­phoma Aware­ness Day takes place on Sept 15 each year — and bet­ter di­ag­nos­tics mea­sures have led to much ear­lier de­tec­tion of the can­cer to­day, com­pared to a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan says that early symp­toms of DLBCL in­clude lumps in the neck or groin. Some­times, other or­gans like the spleen and bone mar­row can be affected. How­ever, some pa­tients show no ob­vi­ous symp­toms be­yond ab­dom­i­nal pain, fever and loss of weight. It is thus es­pe­cially im­por­tant to seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion should you dis­play any of the com­mon symp­toms of lym­phoma — in­clud­ing swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit or groin, a per­sis­tent fever, ex­ces­sive night sweats and un­ex­plained weight loss.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan adds that the me­dian age of DLBCL pa­tients in Sin­ga­pore is 60 to 65, though a very small num­ber of pa­tients in their 20s are di­ag­nosed with a sub­type of the can­cer known as pri­mary me­di­asti­nal B-cell lym­phoma.</p>
    <p>More treat­ment op­tions avail­able</p>
    <p>While DLBCL is an ag­gres­sive can­cer, the good news i s that it i s highly treat­able in the early stages.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent ther­a­pies for treat­ing first­line DLBCL in­clude chemo­ther­apy, chemo-im­munother­apy — a com­bi­na­tion use of chemo­ther­apy and im­munother­apy — and stem cell trans­plant in cer­tain groups of pa­tients. About six i n 10 of t hese pa­tients will re­spond to their treat­ment3 and not suf­fer a re­lapse within the next five years.</p>
    <p>This has a huge im­pact on younger pa­tients who are then able to re­sume their daily life and go back to work, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan re­mem­bers a fe­male pa­tient in her early 20s whose ca­reer was just tak­ing off. She was ad­mit­ted with fever and breath­less­ness. Af­ter per­form­ing scans on her, it was dis­cov­ered that there was fluid sur­round­ing her heart and lungs, and she had a tu­mour i n her chest the size of a rugby ball.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, be­cause the cure rate for DLBCL is high, the pa­tient’s con­di­tion has since gone into re­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>A com­bi­na­tion of chemoim­munother­apy drugs i s com­monly rec­om­mended as a first-line treat­ment in DLBCL. Ra­di­a­tion ther­apy or stem cell trans­plant can also be in­cluded as part of the treat­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, about four in 10 pa­tients may not even­tu­ally re­spond to these ther­a­pies or suf­fer from a re­lapse. 3 When this hap­pens, treat­ment op­tions are lim­ited. Some pa­tients can un­dergo a stem cell trans­plant, but about half of t hem are not el­i­gi­ble. 4 This group i ncludes older pa­tients with com­pro­mised im­mune sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Promis­ing times ahead</p>
    <p>While affected pa­tients can con­sider con­tin­u­ing with chemo­ther­apy and chemo-im­munother­apy, there are new promis­ing treat­ment op­tions on the hori­zon, in­clud­ing tar­geted ther­a­pies such as CAR T-cell ther­apy. These tar­geted ther­a­pies in­volve us­ing the pa­tient’s own im­mune cells — also known as T cells — or mol­e­cules that bind a chemo­ther­apy agent to an an­ti­body to fight can­cer­ous blood cells.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that, there are also treat­ment op­tions known as com­bi­na­tion ther­apy. Pre­vi­ously, pa­tients suf­fer­ing a re­lapse have had to rely on ex­ist­ing, first-line treat­ment, which may or may not be ef­fec­tive in com­bat­ing the can­cer. Com­bi­na­tion ther­apy uses the col­lec­tive ef­fect of dif­fer­ent med­i­ca­tions to tar­get dif­fer­ent ar­eas of can­cer­ous B-cells and de­stroy them.</p>
    <p>Says Dr Tan: “[The med­i­cal com­mu­nity is] see­ing progress in DLBCL i mmunother­apy. The cur­rent cure rate is about 70 per cent. Hope­fully, we can in­crease the num­ber to 80 per cent or more. But we mustn’t rest on our lau­rels as we hope to fo­cus on the 20 per cent of pa­tients who still don’ t re­spond to any treat­ments.”</p>
