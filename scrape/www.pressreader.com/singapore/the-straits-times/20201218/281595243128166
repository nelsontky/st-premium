    <p>The like­li­hood of a change in one’s genes af­ter tak­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine is very re­mote, ex­perts said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They were ad­dress­ing the is­sue at a Straits Times Re­set we­bi­nar on the A-Z of the Covid-19 vac­cine in re­sponse to a reader who had asked if this could hap­pen, and lead to a per­son get­ting can­cer a few years later af­ter the vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced that Sin­ga­pore has ap­proved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vac­cine for pan­demic use here.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine is based on mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA) tech­nol­ogy, which uses a chem­i­cal mes­sen­ger to in­struct cells to make pro­teins that mimic the outer sur­face of the coro­n­avirus, which the im­mune sys­tem learns to recog­nise as a for­eign in­vader and mounts a de­fence against.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong of DukeNUS Med­i­cal School, who spe­cialises in emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases, said: “Ge­netic in­for­ma­tion flows mostly in one di­rec­tion, from the DNA to RNA to the pro­tein. Think of it as you have a cen­tral li­brary (where) you can­not bring the book out, but you can only copy the page that you need.”</p>
    <p>RNA can­not be­come DNA ex­cept in the case of cer­tain viruses, known as retro­viruses, with the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus (HIV) be­ing the most fa­mous ex­am­ple, he added. But for retro­viruses to be able to do so, both their key en­zymes are needed to con­vert RNA into DNA and then in­te­grate the DNA into the genome.</p>
    <p>These two en­zymes must be in con­tact with the RNA and DNA, re­spec­tively. So even in HIV pa­tients, the like­li­hood of the en­zymes com­ing to­gether with the RNA at the same time in the cell is very re­mote, Prof Ooi said.</p>
    <p>“It is not easy. To us we think a cell is very small, but to the RNA – if the RNA is the size of one hu­man be­ing, the cell is the size of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The panel said those who do not have HIV will be safe. Even if one has HIV, it is still safe as the chances of gene change are very re­mote.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim Poh Lian, di­rec­tor of the high-level iso­la­tion unit at the National Cen­tre for</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious Dis­eases and a mem­ber of the Covid-19 vac­cine ex­pert com­mit­tee, added that the half-life of mRNA vac­cines is very short. Once in­jected, it is quickly taken up by the body’s cells and bro­ken down af­ter 48 hours.</p>
    <p>“The role of the mes­sen­ger RNA is ba­si­cally to give in­struc­tions to make pro­tein. And then the im­mune sys­tem ac­tu­ally de­vel­ops pro­tec­tion. But RNA can­not in­te­grate into the hu­man genome. It ac­tu­ally never gets into the hu­man DNA, be­cause our ge­netic ma­te­rial is DNA, not RNA,” she said.</p>
