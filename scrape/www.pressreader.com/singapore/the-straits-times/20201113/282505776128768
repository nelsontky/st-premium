    <p>Step­ping into a Casa Loewe store is like en­ter­ing a taste­fully cu­rated home.</p>
    <p>Arm­chairs and ceramic pots sit along­side Loewe prod­ucts. Art­works are strate­gi­cally placed through­out, as if picked out by a dis­cern­ing home­owner fur­nish­ing his sa­cred space.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish lux­ury fash­ion house has just five of these exclusive stores – casa means home in Span­ish – around the world. The lat­est, the first in South-east Asia, opened in Sin­ga­pore at Ion Or­chard on Oct 30.</p>
    <p>Un­like reg­u­lar Loewe stores – there are two here in Paragon and Ma­rina Bay Sands – Casa Loewe is a re­tail space that high­lights craft, with ob­jects of in­ter­est in ev­ery corner.</p>
    <p>Loewe chief ex­ec­u­tive Pas­cale Le­poivre tells The Straits Times in an exclusive e-mail in­ter­view: “We do not want peo­ple to feel in­tim­i­dated when en­ter­ing our stores.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, home to the French­woman is “a cu­rated space where art, craft and de­sign co-ex­ist while main­tain­ing a warm and wel­com­ing at­mos­phere”.</p>
    <p>Loewe is one of the world’s old­est fash­ion houses, founded i n 1846 as a leather goods ate­lier.</p>
    <p>But the sto­ried brand, which is owned by French multi­na­tional LVMH, has long shed its stuffy ex­te­rior. Many credit cre­ative direc­tor Jonathan An­der­son, who joined the brand in 2013, for its con­tem­po­rary vibe and good rep­u­ta­tion among fash­ion in­sid­ers to­day.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old North­ern Ir­ish de­signer is also the founder of his epony­mous la­bel JW An­der­son.</p>
    <p>Loewe’s new i mage comes through at the Casa Loewe flag­ship here – a 340 sq m space that breathes cut­ting-edge fun with sleek in­te­ri­ors, quirky art­works and pink walls.</p>
    <p>There was no ques­tion about push­ing for­ward with the brickand-mor­tar store, de­spite the cur­rent cli­mate, says Ms Le­poivre, who joined Loewe in 2016 from French lux­ury house Ce­line.</p>
    <p>“Crises al­ways have a be­gin­ning and an end and we have to an­tic­i­pate a kind of ‘back to nor­mal’ life – es­pe­cially in Asia where we see the cri­sis in much bet­ter con­trol. Hav­ing said that, crises are of­ten the right mo­ment to in­vest, es­pe­cially in strate­gic coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>And Sin­ga­pore was an “ob­vi­ous choice” for a Casa Loewe store. The first opened in 2016 in Madrid,</p>
    <p>fol­lowed by Lon­don, Tokyo and Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“A few years ago, when we de­fined the de­vel­op­ment strat­egy of our Casa Loewe stores, Sin­ga­pore was one of the key coun­tries where we wanted to bring this unique con­cept – the full flavour of Loewe,” Ms Le­poivre says.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore has a unique po­si­tion­ing in South-east Asia, at­tract­ing trav­ellers from sev­eral coun­tries of the re­gion. Ion was also an ob­vi­ous choice.”</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, the pan­demic, which forced more into stay­ing in, has thrown the “casa” into the spot­light.</p>
    <p>Ms Le­poivre says: “Dur­ing the pan­demic, we have spent more time than ever at home, so the idea of the home has be­come more rel­e­vant. At the same time, the dig­i­tal ex­po­sure has given us a long­ing for craft, a crav­ing for the touch – which has al­ways been key to our brand.”</p>
    <p>As such, tac­tile ex­pe­ri­ences abound in a Casa Loewe store.</p>
    <p>The de­sign was led by An­der­son, who in 2016 founded the Loewe Foun­da­tion Craft Prize, an in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion recog­nis­ing crafts­men and ar­ti­sans.</p>
    <p>He had in­tended Casa Loewe as a cross be­tween a home and an art gallery.</p>
    <p>In the Sin­ga­pore store, you find pieces like a hand-dyed ta­pes­try by Amer­i­can artist Josh Faught, hand­wo­ven car­pets by tex­tile de­signer John Allen, and ce­ram­ics by Bri­tish artists Betty Blandino and Ni­cholas Homoky. Each is ac­com­pa­nied by a plaque of the artist’s name, re­in­forc­ing the art gallery feel.</p>
    <p>A strik­ing wooden bench by the Loewe Foun­da­tion Craft Prize 2019 fi­nal­ists Jim Par­tridge and Liz Walm­s­ley, sits in the in­ner en­clave of the store – show­ing An­der­son’s pen­chant for spot­light­ing the works of fi­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>Pre-pan­demic, they used to have the added hon­our of show­cas­ing their works at Loewe shows dur­ing Paris Fash­ion Week.</p>
    <p>The art and de­sign cre­ate a sense of com­fort for shop­pers. Here, they can pe­ruse the full range of women’s and men’s ready-towear, bags, small leather goods, ac­ces­sories and shoes.</p>
    <p>New­est to the brand’s of­fer­ings are home fra­grances, in­tro­duced in Septem­ber and in­spired by a veg­etable gar­den.</p>
    <p>“It rounds off the Loewe ex­pe­ri­ence. Jonathan is pas­sion­ate about gar­dens and plants – the choice of the scents is a very per­sonal selec­tion of his,” says Ms Le­poivre, adding that he has wanted to cre­ate the col­lec­tion since tak­ing over the man­tle in 2013.</p>
    <p>Still, even an es­tab­lished lux­ury house is not im­mune to the changes in re­tail brought about by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Le­poivre has no­ticed new cus­tomer be­havioural pat­terns – “an ac­cel­er­a­tion of dig­i­tal and om­nichan­nel shop­ping, with more cus­tomers search­ing on­line for lux­ury prod­ucts”.</p>
    <p>They also have “higher e-com­merce shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence ex­pec­ta­tions”, she adds, for prod­uct ful­fil­ment, site us­abil­ity and nav­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>So the house has adapted ac­cord­ingly, ramp­ing up om­nichan­nel ser­vices by im­prov­ing “real time stock vis­i­bil­ity and avail­abil­ity – to pro­vide an ‘end­less aisle’ of prod­ucts to our cus­tomers”, she adds.</p>
    <p>What cus­tomers look for has also changed. Ms Le­poivre has ob­served two mind­sets.</p>
    <p>In some re­gions, there ex­ists “a more con­scious mind­set when pur­chas­ing lux­ury prod­ucts”, with cus­tomers buy­ing “silent lux­ury” that pri­ori­tises craft and her­itage. Else­where, lux­ury con­sumers in­dulge in “re­venge spend­ing”.</p>
    <p>No doubt the first group is in Loewe’s favour. The house may be play­ing catch-up in adapt­ing to the on­line space, but its grow­ing rep­u­ta­tion for crafts­man­ship is likely to be to its ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>And now, it has a new play­ground to show­case it.</p>
    <p>“Craft is and has al­ways been at the essence of Loewe,” Ms Le­poivre adds.</p>
    <p>“I think the Casa Loewe con­cept is more rel­e­vant than ever, mak­ing it closer to a life­style store where fash­ion, cul­ture and craft are in­ter­twined, en­sur­ing the lo­cal foot­print through its art­work.”</p>
