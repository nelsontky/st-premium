    <p>De­spite Covid-19 tight­en­ing the noose around some busi­nesses, more firms have been set up in the past five months than in the same pe­riod last year, with ex­perts de­scrib­ing this new wave of en­trepreneur­s as a sign of con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore’s re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>About 5,500 to 6,400 new busi­nesses were formed monthly be­tween June and last month, com­pared with about 5,300 a month over the same time­frame last year, checks by The Sun­day Times show.</p>
    <p>There was par­tic­u­lar in­ter­est in the whole­sale trade and re­tail sec­tors, and ex­perts be­lieve this is linked to the growth of e-com­merce plat­forms as more peo­ple shop from home.</p>
    <p>The con­ducive credit en­vi­ron­ment, boosted by govern­ment schemes, could also have en­cour­aged some peo­ple to strike out, said Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of fi­nance Aurobindo Ghosh.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ac­count­ing and</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity’s (Acra) statis­tics, the num­ber of new busi­nesses reg­is­tered has been on an up­ward trend since the coun­try en­tered phase two of re­open­ing its econ­omy in June.</p>
    <p>The June to Oc­to­ber fig­ures also out­paced the reg­is­tra­tions in the first five months of this year, with the monthly num­bers rang­ing be­tween 3,700 and 5,100.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try told The Sun­day Times that sec­tors linked to avi­a­tion and tourism have in­deed been hit hard by the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Nonethe­less, there are sec­tors in our econ­omy which con­tinue to grow, in­clud­ing the man­u­fac­tur­ing, fi­nance and in­sur­ance, as well as in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion sec­tors,” said a min­istry spokesman.</p>
    <p>In the first 10 months of this year, more new en­trants came on board than in the same pe­riod last year – about 52,400 en­ti­ties, ver­sus about 51,700 a year ago, de­spite Sin­ga­pore go­ing through its worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>While Acra’s data does not fully rep­re­sent ac­tive busi­nesses, ex­perts say this year’s en­tity for­ma­tion fig­ures so far – which are just shy of the 10-month av­er­age from 2015 to last year – in­di­cate that many en­trepreneur­s re­main con­fi­dent of their op­por­tu­ni­ties for now.</p>
    <p>Some first-time en­trepreneur­s – in­clud­ing those who lost their jobs ow­ing to the Covid-19 out­break – could have de­cided to start a busi­ness due to the ease of set­ting up shop, while ex­pect­ing min­i­mal down­side risks.</p>
    <p>“If a dis­placed per­son were to eval­u­ate be­tween reskilling for a job now – which would take time and pos­si­ble op­por­tu­nity cost of lower in­come – the mo­ti­va­tion to be an en­tre­pre­neur can be higher as the op­por­tu­nity risk view would be lower,” said Mr Ger­ard Toh, a part­ner at pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm KPMG .</p>
    <p>Close to 5,500 in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions ser­vices en­ti­ties have been set up this year.</p>
    <p>The whole­sale trade and re­tail trade sec­tors also saw the en­trance of around 16,700 new en­ti­ties over the Jan­uary to Oc­to­ber pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The whole­sale trade sec­tor in­cludes prod­uct distrib­u­tors, while re­tail trade cov­ers any­thing from con­ve­nience stores to su­per­mar­kets and fash­ion out­lets.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Wong Poh Kam from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s busi­ness school said that the rise in whole­sale trade busi­ness en­ti­ties could be linked to the growth of re­tail­ers that op­er­ate mostly on e-com­merce plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The trans­port and lo­gis­tics sec­tor was the only one out of 15 that had more busi­nesses close than open over the first 10 months of the year, go­ing by the data.</p>
    <p>One rea­son could be that this sec­tor tends to be more re­source-in­ten­sive com­pared with oth­ers, said Prof Ghosh. Also, the re­duced vol­ume of global trade as well as leisure travel might have re­duced the de­mand for trans­port and lo­gis­tics ser­vices in gen­eral, he said.</p>
    <p>De­spite a re­cent up­trend in busi­ness for­ma­tions in Sin­ga­pore, en­tity clo­sures are also ex­pected to rise in the com­ing months, ex­perts told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Around 35,400 were dereg­is­tered be­tween Jan­uary and Oc­to­ber – lower than the av­er­age of 41,100 seen over the same 10-month pe­riod be­tween 2015 and last year, ac­cord­ing to data from the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity (Acra).</p>
    <p>But Mr Ger­ard Toh, part­ner at pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm KPMG, ex­pects clo­sures to rise in the com­ing months, given that ini­tia­tives such as the Jobs Sup­port Scheme and debt mora­to­ri­ums are taper­ing off. Brick-and-mor­tar re­tail­ers, firms that have yet to ex­plore dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, and those which are sub­ject to lim­its on phys­i­cal crowds, are more likely to close, he added.</p>
    <p>The re­cently-in­tro­duced Sim­pli­fied In­sol­vency Pro­gramme, which helps com­pa­nies that are no longer vi­able to wind up ef­fi­ciently, is also ex­pected to make it eas­ier and cheaper for some mi­cro and small firms to exit the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The Acra data may not have fully re­flected the cur­rent slate of de­clin­ing busi­nesses, said Pro­fes­sor Wong Poh Kam of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that wind­ing up a com­pany could take up to a year, as debts and le­gal obli­ga­tions need to be set­tled be­fore the firm can be dereg­is­tered. In some cases, the process could take sev­eral years, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tee Wey Lih, di­rec­tor at re­struc­tur­ing spe­cial­ist Acres Ad­vi­sory, said wind­ing up mi­cro com­pa­nies with an­nual rev­enue of less than $1 mil­lion usu­ally takes nine months to a year.</p>
    <p>While his firm has not seen an in­crease in clo­sures in the sec­ond half of the year so far, he added that there was a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in in­quiries this month, es­pe­cially from the re­tail and food and bev­er­age sec­tors. The busi­nesses ranged from start-ups to more es­tab­lished or­gan­i­sa­tions, and most of them had cash-flow is­sues, Mr Tee noted.</p>
    <p>“With so much un­cer­tainty, the own­ers are not pre­pared to in­ject cap­i­tal to sus­tain the busi­nesses,” he added.</p>
