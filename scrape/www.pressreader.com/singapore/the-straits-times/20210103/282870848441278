    <p>•</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham man­ager Jose Mour­inho hailed his at­tack­ing duo Harry Kane and Son He­ung­min for do­ing “spe­cial things” this sea­son, af­ter Spurs beat Leeds 3-0 in their Premier League home match yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For­ward Son scored his 100th Tot­ten­ham goal from a Kane as­sist, af­ter the Eng­land striker’s penalty had opened the scor­ing at the Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>Reach­ing his cen­tury of Spurs goals was a land­mark mo­ment for the South Korean, who is the 18th player to score 100 in all com­pe­ti­tions for the north Lon­don club and the first from out­side the United King­dom and Ire­land.</p>
    <p>Since ar­riv­ing from Bayer Lev­erkusen in 2015, the 28-year-old has es­tab­lished him­self as one of Tot­ten­ham’s key play­ers and main­tain­ing his fine form will be key to their hopes of push­ing for the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Toby Alder­weireld scored Tot­ten­ham’s third goal as they climbed to third place.</p>
    <p>“Of course, the un­der­stand­ing (be­tween Kane and Son) is good and against Leeds it was im­por­tant to have that abil­ity in at­tack,” Mour­inho said on BT Sport.</p>
    <p>“They stay man-to-man, so if you stay static you give them an easy job. That move­ment of Harry Kane and Sonny in the fin­ish­ing po­si­tions fit well.</p>
    <p>“I think in the Premier League there are many good play­ers ev­ery­where... But I have to say that Sonny and Harry are do­ing spe­cial things this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“The three points are very im­por­tant. I think we un­der­stood well how they could hurt us and how we could hurt them. In that as­pect, I am happy but I still think we can and have to do bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>It was the 13th time Kane and Son had com­bined for a goal this term, equalling the league record set by Alan Shearer and Chris Sut­ton for Blackburn in 1994-95.</p>
    <p>“We’re work­ing hard and work­ing on it for a long time. I am a bit sad I couldn’t give an as­sist to ‘H’.</p>
    <p>Some­times it is tele­pathic, some­times we talk about it,” said Son.</p>
    <p>“It was a re­ally dif­fi­cult game. To get a clean sheet, 3-0, to start the new year is fan­tas­tic.”</p>
    <p>On scor­ing his 100th goal, he added: “I’m very grate­ful for my team­mates. I am not do­ing it alone – I need a lot of help.</p>
    <p>“To score 100 goals with one team is a big thing. I’m very proud.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing ended their run of four league games with­out a win, Tot­ten­ham moved within four points of lead­ers Liver­pool (33), who play Southamp­ton away to­mor­row, and</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>The win was es­pe­cially wel­come af­ter Spurs were forced to crit­i­cise Erik Lamela, Ser­gio Reguilon and Gio­vani lo Celso af­ter the trio were pic­tured breach­ing Covid-19 rules by at­tend­ing a Christ­mas party. Lamela was not in the squad yes­ter­day, while Reguilon was on the bench and lo Celso was in­jured.</p>
    <p>Leeds man­ager Marcelo Bielsa ad­mit­ted that his team could not han­dle Kane and Son. He said: “The op­po­nents’ for­wards were very dam­ag­ing and dif­fi­cult to con­tain. We made some un­forced er</p>
    <p>rors which fa­cil­i­tated their at­tack. What we needed to do was not lose the ball in our own half. We could have as­pired to a closer game.”</p>
    <p>Separately, French Ligue 1 cham­pi­ons Paris St-Ger­main yes­ter­day named Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino as head coach af­ter sack­ing Thomas Tuchel, with the Ar­gen­tinian sign­ing a deal un­til June next year.</p>
    <p>Po­chet­tino, who played for PSG as a de­fender in the early 2000s and also cap­tained them, has been out of a job since be­ing dis­missed by Spurs in Novem­ber 2019, a few months af­ter guid­ing them to the</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“I would like to thank the club’s man­age­ment for the trust they have placed in me. As you know, this club has al­ways held a spe­cial place in my heart,” Po­chet­tino, who has an op­tion for a one-year ex­ten­sion, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“I have won­der­ful mem­o­ries, es­pe­cially of the unique at­mos­phere of the Parc des Princes. I re­turn to the club to­day with a lot of am­bi­tion and hu­mil­ity, and am ea­ger to work with some of the world’s most tal­ented play­ers.”</p>
