    <p>UNITED NA­TIONS • World lead­ers will send videos in­stead of phys­i­cally gath­er­ing at the United Na­tions in Septem­ber due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, a move that paves the way for peo­ple wary of trav­el­ling to the United States – like North Korean leader Kim Jong</p>
    <p>Un – to par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>The an­nual high-level meet­ing had been shap­ing up to be a week­long cel­e­bra­tion of the 75th an­niver­sary of the world body, but UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res sug­gested in May that lead­ers send video state­ments due to likely travel is­sues.</p>
    <p>The 193-mem­ber Gen­eral Assem­bly agreed on Wed­nes­day to the spe­cial mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Each mem­ber state, ob­server state and the Euro­pean Union can sub­mit a pre-recorded state­ment of its head of state, vice-pres­i­dent, crown prince or princess, head of gov­ern­ment, min­is­ter or vice-min­is­ter, which will be played in the gen­eral assem­bly hall... af­ter in­tro­duc­tion by their rep­re­sen­ta­tive who is phys­i­cally present,” ac­cord­ing to the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally, hun­dreds of events are also held on the side­lines of the UN de­bate, but Gen­eral Assem­bly Pres­i­dent Ti­j­jani Muham­madBande wrote in a letter to states that they were “en­cour­aged to move all side events to vir­tual plat­forms to limit the foot­print and num­ber of peo­ple in the UN build­ing”.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has in­fected at least 15.1 mil­lion peo­ple and there have been more than 619,000 known deaths world­wide, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>New York, the site of the UN head­quar­ters, was a global epi­cen­tre ear­lier this year for the virus, which was first de­tected in China late last year.</p>
    <p>As UN host coun­try, the US agreed to grant en­try to lead­ers and diplo­mats from all UN mem­ber states. How­ever, diplo­mats say it reg­u­larly lim­its the del­e­ga­tion size of some of its ad­ver­saries, like Iran.</p>
    <p>While North Korea’s Mr Kim has met three times with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump since 2018 for now­stalled de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion talks, he has never trav­elled to the US as leader or taken part in the UN Gen­eral Assem­bly.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Ri Yong Ho trav­elled to New York to ad­dress the UN from 2016 to 2018, but he did not at­tend last year.</p>
    <p>North Korea’s UN mis­sion did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment on whether Mr Kim would send a video state­ment for this year’s high-level meet­ing.</p>
