    <p>Re­lief mea­sures to help in­di­vid­u­als and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) with cash flow dif­fi­cul­ties will be ex­tended into next year.</p>
    <p>This is in­tended to give those who have ap­plied to de­fer loan re­pay­ments more time to re­sume their debt ser­vic­ing, said the Mon­e­tary Authority of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) yes­ter­day, in its joint an­nounce­ment with The As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore and the Fi­nance Houses As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures are also avail­able to those who have not ap­plied to de­fer pay­ments pre­vi­ously, but are now fac­ing cash flow chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>The ex­tended re­lief will al­low both in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses to tran­si­tion grad­u­ally to full loan re­pay­ments, as the cen­tral bank and the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try recog­nise that many will con­tinue to ex­pe­ri­ence cash flow pres­sures into early next year, MAS said.</p>
    <p>But it urged bor­row­ers who are able to re­sume pay­ing loan in­stal­ments in full to start do­ing so from Jan 1 next year.</p>
    <p>“We want to con­tinue pro­vid­ing re­lief to bor­row­ers fac­ing cash flow chal­lenges while en­cour­ag­ing them to re­sume loan re­pay­ments to the ex­tent they are able to, so that they do not ac­cu­mu­late too much debt,” said MAS man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon.</p>
    <p>“A good out­come is one where in­di­vid­u­als and SMEs are able to use the sup­port mea­sures to help them tide through the cur­rent eco­nomic dif­fi­cul­ties and emerge with a sus­tain­able debt bur­den as the econ­omy re­cov­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>RE­LIEF FOR IN­DI­VID­U­ALS</p>
    <p>Mea­sures for which the ap­pli­ca­tion pe­riod has been ex­tended to June 30 next year in­clude con­vert­ing credit card bal­ances to a lower in­ter­est term loan.</p>
    <p>Those who are un­able to re­sume full loan re­pay­ments on their prop­erty loans may ap­ply to make re­duced in­stal­ment pay­ments pegged at 60 per cent of their monthly in­stal­ment, for a pe­riod of up to nine months. In­di­vid­u­als ser­vic­ing ren­o­va­tion and stu­dent loans may also ap­ply to ex­tend loan tenures by up to three years.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria for these two mea­sures in­clude proof of in­come loss.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank has ap­proved some 9,000 home loan re­pay­ment re­lief ap­pli­ca­tions amount­ing to $5.2 bil­lion so far, while OCBC Bank has ap­proved more than 8,000 mort­gage, car and ren­o­va­tion loan re­lief ap­pli­ca­tions to­talling over $5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>United Overseas Bank has re­ceived more than 8,000 ap­pli­ca­tions to de­fer mort­gage re­pay­ments and more than 4,000 ap­pli­ca­tions to con­vert un­se­cured debt into lower-cost term loans. It said it ap­proved the ma­jor­ity of them.</p>
    <p>RE­LIEF FOR SMEs</p>
    <p>Fur­ther sup­port has also been made avail­able to SMEs, by al­low­ing the de­fer­ment of loan re­pay­ment be­yond the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Un­der pre­vi­ously an­nounced mea­sures, com­pa­nies could ap­ply to de­fer prin­ci­pal re­pay­ments on their se­cured loans granted by banks or fi­nance com­pa­nies un­til Dec 31 this year.</p>
    <p>The Ex­tended Sup­port Scheme – Stan­dard­ised will al­low busi­nesses in sec­tors most af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic to de­fer 80 per cent of prin­ci­pal pay­ments un­til June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>This ap­plies to SMEs in the fol­low­ing sec­tors: avi­a­tion and aero­space, tourism, hos­pi­tal­ity, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions, built en­vi­ron­ment, li­censed food shops and food stalls, qual­i­fy­ing re­tail out­lets, arts and en­ter­tain­ment, marine and off­shore, as well as land trans­port.</p>
    <p>Firms in other sec­tors can ap­ply to de­fer 80 per cent of prin­ci­pal pay­ments un­til March 31 next year.</p>
    <p>Loans granted un­der En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s en­hanced work­ing cap­i­tal loan scheme and tem­po­rary bridg­ing loan pro­gramme are also el­i­gi­ble for de­fer­ment.</p>
    <p>A cus­tomised sup­port scheme to fa­cil­i­tate multi-lender re­struc­tur­ing, for firms where the stan­dard­ised scheme is not suit­able, is also be­ing de­vel­oped by banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>This Ex­tended Sup­port Scheme – Cus­tomised is in­tended to com­ple­ment other re­struc­tur­ing as­sis­tance schemes, such as the Min­istry of Law’s pro­posed Sim­pli­fied In­sol­vency Pro­gramme, MAS said.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for both sup­port schemes will open on Nov 2.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther de­tails on the re­lief mea­sures can be found at https://www.mas.gov.sg/covid-19</p>
