    <p>CLEVE­LAND They voted from cars and at out­door ta­bles. They stood in lines spaced far apart. They strapped on masks and pumped sani­tiser into their palms.</p>
    <p>All across the United States on Tues­day, vot­ers cast bal­lots in a pres­i­den­tial election in which the un­con­trolled coro­n­avirus pan­demic was both a top is­sue and a threat.</p>
    <p>In many places, vot­ers and poll work­ers took ex­tra­or­di­nary mea­sures on Tues­day to try to pro­tect them­selves. They wore Amer­i­can flag-themed masks, used nap­kins to drop off votes in bal­lot boxes and even passed bal­lots with the help of salad tongs. “Peo­ple just love the tongs,” said Mr Tommy Nick­er­son, a bal­lot worker in Oak­land, Cal­i­for­nia, where work­ers in face masks used tongs to col­lect bal­lots from drive-through mo­torists.</p>
    <p>Across the street, peo­ple cast bal­lots at ta­bles set up out­side.</p>
    <p>In Michi­gan, another key swing state that Mr Don­ald Trump car­ried by a ra­zor-thin mar­gin four years ago, Democrats were fo­cused on driv­ing up turnout in Detroit. The pan­demic was es­pe­cially dev­as­tat­ing for the city. “It hit us like an atomic bomb,” said Mr Ron­ald Lock­ett, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the North­west Ac­tiv­i­ties Cen­tre, where there was a line out the door to vote on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers who en­tered a polling lo­ca­tion in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, first passed a hand-wash­ing sta­tion out­side the front doors.</p>
    <p>Then there was a kiosk of free masks, wipes and hand sani­tiser just in­side the lobby. The room where they voted was a large, airy gym­na­sium with ta­bles spaced at least 4.5m apart.</p>
    <p>Mr David Sconz­ert, a poll worker, said he care­fully con­sid­ered</p>
    <p>whether to show up on election day at all.</p>
    <p>A can­cer sur­vivor, he said he tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus early last month, yet feared he did not have the im­mu­nity that would pre­vent him from catch­ing it again. “I al­most called it off,” he said. “But then I just thought, ‘No. I’m tak­ing a chance’. ”</p>
    <p>In­side a com­mu­nity bas­ket­ball gym in Cleve­land, poll work­ers fas­tened on masks and sat down be­hind card­board and plas­tic shields that en­cased them on three sides.</p>
    <p>Look­ing more like a row of bank</p>
    <p>tell­ers, they greeted vot­ers, who were ex­pected to give an elec­tronic sig­na­ture by slip­ping on dis­pos­able plas­tic fin­ger shields and then guid­ing their hands un­der a nar­row open­ing. Voter booths had been metic­u­lously mea­sured with a 1.8m rope.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic, which drove record num­bers of Amer­i­cans to cast bal­lots early or by mail, rarely strayed far from vot­ers’ minds.</p>
    <p>“I just don’t want another shut­down,” said Ms Rachel Aus­perk, 29, a first-time voter who said she chose Mr Trump in Ohio, a highly</p>
    <p>con­tested state that re­ported more new coro­n­avirus cases on Tues­day than on any day since the na­tion’s out­break be­gan more than eight months ago.</p>
    <p>In Mi­ami, Mr Ed­die Gil, 50, said that he, too, had been guided by con­cerns about the coro­n­avirus and how it was be­ing han­dled.</p>
    <p>He said he voted for Mr Trump in 2016 but chose Mr Joe Bi­den this year, in part be­cause of the Pres­i­dent’s han­dling of the pan­demic. “The gov­ern­ment has failed all the small busi­nesses,” said Mr Gil, who opened a gym in Jan­uary but said</p>
    <p>the pan­demic forced him to close it.</p>
    <p>In a col­li­sion of two pow­er­ful forces shap­ing 2020, the virus was rag­ing most omi­nously across po­lit­i­cal bat­tle­grounds around the Great Lakes.</p>
    <p>This year, ex­perts are hope­ful that the flood of mail-in vot­ing and pre­cau­tions at the polls will pro­tect election day gath­er­ings from be­com­ing su­per­spreader events.</p>
    <p>But with cases soar­ing na­tion­wide and health of­fi­cials over­whelmed, it may be dif­fi­cult to de­ter­mine in the com­ing weeks what ef­fect vot­ing may have had.</p>
