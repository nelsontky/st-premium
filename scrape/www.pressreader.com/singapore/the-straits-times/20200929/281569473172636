    <p>Vis­i­tors are re­turn­ing to mu­se­ums al­though at­ten­dances have not re­cov­ered to pre-pan­demic lev­els, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Her­itage Board and Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore. Mu­se­ums re­opened on June 26 af­ter eight weeks of clo­sure as part of mea­sures to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors are re­turn­ing to mu­se­ums al­though at­ten­dances have not re­cov­ered to pre-pan­demic lev­els, the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB) and Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore (NGS) have told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>At­ten­dance at the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum (ACM) and the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore (NMS) climbed last month, thanks partly to the Na­tional Day Open House, says Mr Ken­nie Ting, group di­rec­tor of mu­se­ums at NHB.</p>
    <p>Av­er­age monthly vis­i­tor­ship to ACM and NMS last month was more than 12,000 and 31,000 re­spec­tively, com­pared with more than 10,000 and 28,000 in July.</p>
    <p>At the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore, vis­i­tor numbers have more than dou­bled com­pared with its first week of re­open­ing at the end of June, says its chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer Chris Lee, 49.</p>
    <p>“While vis­i­tor numbers have been steadily in­creas­ing week-on­week, they are cur­rently still at about 50 per cent be­low the preCovid-19 pe­riod,” he adds.</p>
    <p>The ArtScience Mu­seum – which re­cently opened a new show ti­tled Planet Or Plas­tic? – has been re­port­ing sim­i­lar trends.</p>
    <p>Its ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Honor Harger says: “We are see­ing the re­turn of our lo­cal res­i­dents to the mu­seum. It is par­tic­u­larly busy on week­ends and dur­ing school hol­i­days.”</p>
    <p>Mu­se­ums re­opened on June 26 af­ter eight weeks of clo­sure as part of cir­cuit-breaker mea­sures to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>NHB and NGS have re­ported good re­sponses for guided tours, which re­sumed late last month with ca­pac­ity caps. NGS has had “a healthy take-up of our daily guided tours”, says Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>There are daily English-lan­guage tours at both ACM and NMS, but Man­darin tours are avail­able only on week­ends at NMS and will re­sume at ACM from Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ting, 42, adds: “The tours have been well-re­ceived and staff have ob­served that vis­i­tors are happy that the tours have re­sumed.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee says NGS has also</p>
    <p>We feel that... on­line pro­grammes rep­re­sent a new chap­ter in our evo­lu­tion as a mu­seum and per­haps show one way that mu­se­ums can work sus­tain­ably dur­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>re­ceived en­cour­ag­ing re­sponse to its free, one-year Gallery Insider mem­ber­ship pro­mo­tion. The mem­ber­ship for Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents of­fers un­lim­ited ac­cess to the mu­seum’s shows, ac­cess to se­lected pro­grammes and dis­counts on mu­seum mer­chan­dise and food and bev­er­age out­lets.</p>
    <p>“Since its launch as part of the Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions in Au­gust, there have been more than 125,000 sign-ups on­line, with more than 25,000 vis­its made to the Gallery to ac­ti­vate the mem­ber­ship,” Mr Lee adds.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has been open­ing up grad­u­ally in the past two months.</p>
    <p>Mice – meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions – events can now ac­cept up to 250 par­tic­i­pants, while up to 100 peo­ple are al­lowed at places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>Mu­se­ums and her­itage in­sti­tu­tions will of­fer a mix of lim­ited on-site pro­grammes and on­line op­tions for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee says NGS will take its cue from the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth.</p>
    <p>But NHB’s Mr Ting says: “Tak­ing guid­ance from Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s safe man­age­ment mea­sures for guided tours, we are also re­view­ing the num­ber of par­tic­i­pants in our mu­seum-guided tours.”</p>
    <p>STB guide­lines cur­rently al­low tour groups of 10, di­vided into two sub-groups of five which are not al­lowed to min­gle.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, all mu­se­ums have amped up dig­i­tal op­tions.</p>
    <p>The ACM has launched a dig­i­tal ver­sion of its new Ma­te­rial and De­sign gal­leries, as well as ACM Trea­sures, which al­lows peo­ple to look at a se­lec­tion of arte­facts in aug­mented re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Both the ACM and In­dian Her­itage Cen­tre of­fer self-guided tours, while NGS has in­tro­duced TEMI, a ro­bot that can take a vis­i­tor on a 20-minute tour of four art­works at the DBS Sin­ga­pore Gallery 1.</p>
    <p>Ms Harger notes that the sil­ver lin­ing of the cri­sis has been the push to go dig­i­tal, which has en­abled mu­se­ums to reach au­di­ences be­yond Sin­ga­pore’s shores while keep­ing lo­cal au­di­ences close.</p>
    <p>ArtScience @ Home, the mu­seum’s dig­i­tal pro­gramme, of­fered more than 50 events, rang­ing from con­fer­ences to per­for­mances, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Ms Harger adds: “We feel that these kinds of on­line pro­grammes rep­re­sent a new chap­ter in our evo­lu­tion as a mu­seum and per­haps show one way that mu­se­ums can work sus­tain­ably dur­ing Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said last Wed­nes­day that the Gov­ern­ment may present plans for mov­ing into phase three, but cau­tion is the key­note for mu­se­ums at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Ting says: “It is still early days to pre­dict how the numbers will change, as much will de­pend on what is hap­pen­ing at a na­tional and global level.”</p>
