    <p>Last month, ex­trem­ist in­flu­encer Zul­fikar Mo­hamad Shar­iff was sen­tenced to six weeks’ jail over a false dec­la­ra­tion when ap­ply­ing to re­new his Sin­ga­pore pass­port in 2013. He had made head­lines when he was de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act four years ago for glo­ri­fy­ing ISIS and vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times speaks to two peo­ple he sought to in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Pre­sent­ing him­self as a man with deep knowl­edge of his re­li­gion, Zul­fikar Mo­hamad Shar­iff con­vinced Mr Mo­hamad Said­dhin Ab­dul­lah that he should also show his sup­port to ter­ror group Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Like Zul­fikar, Mr Said­dhin had a photo taken of him­self strik­ing a pose com­mon for ISIS fight­ers and posted it on his Face­book page.</p>
    <p>He was hauled up by the au­thor­i­ties soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>Four years on, the op­er­a­tions man­ager in his late 30s said the man he looked up to was in re­al­ity a “con sales­man” who de­ceived him and oth­ers into sub­scrib­ing to rad­i­cal ide­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“Zul­fikar uses charm­ing words to ‘goreng’ (slang for con­vince) and is able to stir emo­tions to cause ha­tred and anger. He did this to por­tray the plight of Syr­i­ans in con­flict in­ac­cu­rately,” said Mr Said­dhin in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times last week.</p>
    <p>He and an­other Sin­ga­porean, who had reg­u­lar en­coun­ters with Zul­fikar, 49, and as­sisted in in­ves­ti­ga­tions, agreed to speak about him, say­ing it is an op­por­tu­nity to warn oth­ers of the dan­ger of fall­ing prey to ex­trem­ist in­flu­encers.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar, who be­came an Aus­tralian cit­i­zen in 2011, had been de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act (ISA) since 2016 for ter­ror-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties. He was in the news again re­cently af­ter he was sen­tenced to six weeks’ jail for ly­ing in his ap­pli­ca­tion for a Sin­ga­pore pass­port. He has re­nounced his Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship and is cur­rently in Changi Pri­son.</p>
    <p>Both men ST spoke to said they did not know that Zul­fikar had be­come an Aus­tralian un­til news of his re­cent con­vic­tion. They thought he was merely re­sid­ing in Aus­tralia even as he was claim­ing to speak up on is­sues af­fect­ing Mus­lims in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Through so­cial me­dia, Zul­fikar spread hard­line ide­ol­ogy and rad­i­calised at least two Sin­ga­pore­ans, in­clud­ing Mr Said­dhin. The Home Af­fairs Min­istry noted he had ex­horted Mus­lims to take up arms abroad.</p>
    <p>Mr Said­dhin was is­sued a Re­stric­tion Or­der in 2016, which lapsed in July this year. Un­der the or­der, his move­ments were re­stricted and he was not al­lowed to is­sue public state­ments with­out ap­proval.</p>
    <p>He said he got to know Zul­fikar in 2012 on­line, and was in­vited by him to join the Al-Mak­hazin Face­book group. Mr Said­dhin said he was not very re­li­gious then and was im­pressed with Zul­fikar’s ap­par­ent knowl­edge and pas­sion.</p>
    <p>He said Zul­fikar por­trayed him­self as a cham­pion of Mus­lims in Sin­ga­pore. Mr Said­dhin started read­ing items he posted on his per­sonal Face­book page, crafted as though ISIS was sav­ing Mus­lims by es­tab­lish­ing an Is­lamic caliphate.</p>
    <p>The be­head­ings ISIS car­ried out were brushed aside as fab­ri­ca­tions by Zul­fikar, who said West­ern me­dia was bi­ased and un­trust­wor­thy. “Hav­ing been con­vinced, I then re­posted his ar­ti­cles and com­ments,” said Mr Said­dhin.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from ST, a spokesman for the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment (ISD) said paint­ing ISIS and its agenda of cre­at­ing an Is­lamic caliphate as be­ing for the ben­e­fit of Mus­lims was a com­mon tac­tic of Zul­fikar’s. He de­fended ISIS and its vi­o­lent acts on so­cial me­dia, and shared pro­pa­ganda on how good life was in Syria un­der ISIS rule.</p>
    <p>He also posted emo­tive vi­su­als de­pict­ing the plight of Mus­lims in the Syr­ian con­flict to sway fol­low­ers to the ISIS cause.</p>
    <p>Aca­demics who study rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion note that such so­cial me­dia groups, by feed­ing on griev­ances, build anger and ha­tred, mak­ing per­sons who are in­flu­enced more sus­cep­ti­ble to be in­cited to vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Mr Said­dhin said he now knows that charis­matic char­ac­ters like Zul­fikar, who are not re­li­giously trained, can “use their charm to sway” the ac­tual mean­ing of Is­lam. “Af­ter be­ing guided by ac­cred­ited us­taz, I re­alised re­li­gion can­not be some­thing which is sold or mar­keted freely by peo­ple like him.”</p>
    <p>‘STREET-CRED’ AP­PEAL TO SOME</p>
    <p>The other man, a mid­dle-aged pro­fes­sional who agreed to speak on con­di­tion of anonymity, shared how he felt ma­nip­u­lated and ac­knowl­edged that the use of the ISA against Zul­fikar helped pre­vent him from harm­ing oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“Zul­fikar had a way with words, he has some ‘street-cred’ based on his early ac­tiv­i­ties on Mus­lim is­sues. Maybe that gave him cred­i­bil­ity among some peo­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar con­tin­ued to harp on Malay/Mus­lim is­sues like the tudung. The man said this was dis­cussed ex­ten­sively by Zul­fikar in a What­sApp group he be­longed to.</p>
    <p>The group evolved into an on­line space where mem­bers would talk about var­i­ous com­mu­nity is­sues.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar also tried to mask his in­volve­ment by reg­is­ter­ing an In­ter­net do­main us­ing a group mem­ber’s name with­out the per­son’s con­sent or knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Both men said they reg­u­larly chat­ted with him on­line and face to face, when he was in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In the group chat, Zul­fikar of­ten dom­i­nated con­ver­sa­tions and tried to con­vince oth­ers that his viewpoint was cor­rect. “If you dis­agreed with him, then you are wrong. He was very stuck in his views, and quite stub­born in them,” the pro­fes­sional said.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar, it turned out, cre­ated such chat groups to pro­voke Mus­lims to re­ject and dis­man­tle the sec­u­lar state and es­tab­lish an Is­lamic caliphate, the man added.</p>
    <p>Said the ISD spokesman: “Such tac­tics would in­ad­ver­tently ap­peal to those who al­ready hold the view that the West was op­press­ing Mus­lims, and draw them fur­ther into Zul­fikar’s sphere of in­flu­ence.”</p>
    <p>The four years un­der a Re­stric­tion Or­der took a toll on Mr Said­dhin, his wife and three young chil­dren ini­tially, but he said it helped them be­come closer too.</p>
    <p>Un­der the or­der, he was not al­lowed to travel and had to get ap­proval be­fore chang­ing jobs. He also had to at­tend re­li­gious and psy­cho­log­i­cal coun­selling.</p>
    <p>But Mr Said­dhin said he was thank­ful for the sup­port he re­ceived from his re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion of­fi­cers and coun­sel­lors.</p>
    <p>He now un­der­stands the im­por­tance of crit­i­cal think­ing, and ver­i­fy­ing in­for­ma­tion with cred­i­ble sources. “I want to pre­vent some­one else be­com­ing like the fool I was, who suf­fered and caused my loved ones to suf­fer.”</p>
