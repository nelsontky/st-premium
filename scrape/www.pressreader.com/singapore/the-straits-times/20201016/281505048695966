    <p>The pri­vate home market con­tin­ues to defy grav­ity amid the pan­demic, with last month’s sales up for a fifth straight month to hit lev­els not seen for more than two years.</p>
    <p>The ro­bust numbers – 1,329 units sold, 5.6 per cent more than the 1,258 in Au­gust – came de­spite a fall in the num­ber of new homes launched last month.</p>
    <p>This was the high­est num­ber of pri­vate new home trans­ac­tions since July 2018, when 1,724 units were trans­acted after new prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures fu­elled a surge in sales from buy­ers rush­ing to beat the dead­line.</p>
    <p>In another sign of the market’s re­silience, last month’s sales were 4.65 per cent ahead of the 1,270 units moved in the same month last year.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures from the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA) yes­ter­day ex­clude ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium (EC) units, which are a pub­lic-pri­vate hous­ing hy­brid.</p>
    <p>The URA clam­p­down on de­vel­op­ers reis­su­ing an op­tion to pur­chase to the same buyer of the same unit is widely ex­pected to have a slight chill­ing ef­fect on sales as it may de­ter mar­ginal buy­ers from com­mit­ting pre­ma­turely.</p>
    <p>“But based on the run rate of some 152 new pri­vate homes sold in the first four days of Oc­to­ber, based on caveats down­loaded on Oct 14, sales are still quite strong, sug­gest­ing gen­uine de­mand,” said Ms Tri­cia Song, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>At­trac­tively priced projects in the city fringe – known as the rest of cen­tral re­gion – con­tin­ued to fuel sales last month, ac­count­ing for nearly 65 per cent of to­tal trans­ac­tions, an­a­lysts noted.</p>
    <p>The stand­out among three new non-landed launches last month was Pen­rose in Sims Drive, while ex­ist­ing top sell­ers such as JadeS­cape and The Woodleigh Res­i­dences also fared well.</p>
    <p>Pen­rose shifted 389 units at a me­dian price of $1,541 psf to ac­count for about 45 per cent of to­tal de­vel­oper sales in the city fringe, ac­cord­ing to Knight Frank.</p>
    <p>Two other launches in that zone – Verdale and Myra – man­aged to sell 59 units in to­tal last month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the sub­urbs, or out­side cen­tral re­gion, and the prime dis­trict, or core cen­tral re­gion, saw a slight month-on-month dip in trans­ac­tions as de­mand eased.</p>
    <p>De­spite sales vol­umes in the out­side cen­tral re­gion fall­ing by about 24 per cent from Au­gust, pre­vi­ously launched projects Trea­sure at</p>
    <p>Tampines and The Gar­den Res­i­dences con­tinue to sell well, Knight Frank said.</p>
    <p>If ECs are in­cluded, 1,385 new homes were sold last month, up 5.8 per cent from Au­gust and 6.7 per cent higher than a year ear­lier, URA data showed.</p>
    <p>There were 1,340 pri­vate homes launched last month, down 15.3 per cent from 1,582 units in Au­gust, and nearly 22 per cent lower than a year ear­lier. No EC projects were launched last month.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers sold 7,532 new homes in the first nine months of the year, com­pared with 7,469 in the same pe­riod last year, a per­for­mance that has far ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions given ris­ing re­trench­ments, wage cuts and the pan­demic-in­duced re­ces­sion, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>“In the sec­ond and third quar­ters, se­vere GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct) con­trac­tions of mi­nus 13.3 per cent and mi­nus 7 per cent re­spec­tively were recorded. But the over­all price in­dex for pri­vate homes</p>
    <p>rose 0.3 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter and 0.8 per cent in the third (based on flash es­ti­mates),” said Mr Ong Teck Hui, JLL’s se­nior direc­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy.</p>
    <p>“The in­con­gru­ence be­tween eco­nomic per­for­mance and home prices as well as up­beat sales vol­ume in the last few months raises the ques­tion of whether the res­i­den­tial market is grad­u­ally be­ing delinked from the econ­omy,” he said.</p>
