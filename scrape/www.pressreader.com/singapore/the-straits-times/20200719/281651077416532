    <p>A re­cip­ro­cal green lane and pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia will be­gin on Aug 10, al­low­ing lim­ited cross-bor­der travel be­tween both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment last Tues­day, Malaysian For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein and Sin­ga­pore For­eign Min­is­ter Vivian Balakrishn­an said the two schemes are meant to ad­dress the needs of dif­fer­ent groups of cross-bor­der trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>The green lane will en­able cross-bor­der travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial pur­poses, and el­i­gi­ble trav­ellers will have to abide by the pre­vail­ing Covid-19 pre­ven­tion and pub­lic health mea­sures mu­tu­ally agreed upon by both coun­tries. These in­clude un­der­go­ing poly­merase chain re­ac­tion swab tests.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers are also re­quired to sub­mit a con­trolled itinerary to the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties of the re­ceiv­ing coun­try and ad­here to this dur­ing their visit.</p>
    <p>The pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment will al­low hold­ers of long-term im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try to en­ter that coun­try for work.</p>
    <p>Af­ter at least three con­sec­u­tive months in their coun­try of work, these pass hold­ers may re­turn to their home coun­try for a short home leave, and there­after re-en­ter their coun­try of work for at least an­other three con­sec­u­tive months, said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Rel­e­vant agen­cies of both govern­ments are fi­nal­is­ing the stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures of the two ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing any quar­an­tine re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries have agreed to pub­lish the re­quire­ments, health pro­to­cols and ap­pli­ca­tion process in­volved for en­try and exit in Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore 10 days be­fore their im­ple­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries have also agreed to de­velop other schemes for cross-bor­der move­ment, in­clud­ing a pro­posal for daily cross-bor­der com­mut­ing for work pur­poses.</p>
    <p>This will take into ac­count the re­quired health pro­to­cols and avail­able med­i­cal re­sources in both coun­tries to en­sure the safety of the ci­ti­zens of both sides.</p>
