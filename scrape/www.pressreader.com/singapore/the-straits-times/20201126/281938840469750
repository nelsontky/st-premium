    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • A mys­te­ri­ous metal “obelisk” found buried in the re­mote western United States desert has in­flamed the imag­i­na­tions of UFO spot­ters, con­spir­acy the­o­rists and Stan­ley Kubrick fans around the world.</p>
    <p>The shiny, tri­an­gu­lar pil­lar – which pro­trudes ap­prox­i­mately 3.6m from the red rocks of south­ern Utah – was spot­ted on Nov 18 by baf­fled lo­cal of­fi­cials count­ing bighorn sheep from the air.</p>
    <p>Land­ing to in­ves­ti­gate, Utah Depart­ment of Public Safety crew found “a metal mono­lith in­stalled in the ground” but “no ob­vi­ous in­di­ca­tion of who might have put the mono­lith there”.</p>
    <p>“It is il­le­gal to in­stall struc­tures or art with­out au­tho­ri­sa­tion on fed­er­ally man­aged public lands, no mat­ter what planet you’re from,” warned the agency in a tongue-in-cheek press state­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>News of the dis­cov­ery quickly</p>
    <p>went vi­ral on­line, with many not­ing the ob­ject’s sim­i­lar­ity with strange alien mono­liths that trig­ger huge leaps in hu­man progress in Kubrick’s clas­sic sci-fi film, 2001: A Space Odyssey.</p>
    <p>With of­fi­cials re­fus­ing to dis­close the ob­ject’s lo­ca­tion out of fear that hordes of cu­ri­ous sight­seers would flock to the re­mote wilder­ness, a race has also be­gun on­line to ge­olo­cate the “obelisk” us­ing sur­round­ing rock for­ma­tions.</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers pointed out the ob­ject’s re­sem­blance to the avan­tgarde work of Amer­i­can artist John McCracken, who had lived for a time in nearby New Mex­ico, and died in 2011.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, a spokesman for his rep­re­sen­ta­tive David Zwirner said it was not one of McCracken’s works, but pos­si­bly by a fel­low artist pay­ing homage.</p>
    <p>How­ever, later in the day, Mr Zwirner gave an­other state­ment</p>
    <p>in which he sug­gested that the piece was in­deed by McCracken, mean­ing it had lain undis­cov­ered in the desert for nearly a decade.</p>
    <p>“The gallery is di­vided on this,” he said. “I be­lieve this is def­i­nitely by John.</p>
    <p>“Who would have known that 2020 had yet an­other sur­prise for us. Just when we thought we had seen it all. Let’s go see it.”</p>
