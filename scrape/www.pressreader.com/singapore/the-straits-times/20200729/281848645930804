    <p>SEOUL • North Korean women de­tained in prison camps suf­fered from tor­ture, rape and other forms of “mul­ti­ple and se­ri­ous” vi­o­lence by se­cu­rity and po­lice of­fi­cials, a United Na­tions hu­man rights re­port said yes­ter­day, cit­ing ac­counts from over 100 women.</p>
    <p>The women, de­tained between 2009 and last year af­ter fail­ing to flee the coun­try, re­counted in in­ter­views with UN in­ves­ti­ga­tors in Seoul af­ter their re­lease how they were de­prived of food, sleep, day­light and fresh air while in the de­ten­tion cen­tres and prison camps.</p>
    <p>Many also said in the re­port ti­tled I Still Feel The Pain that they were sub­jected to tor­ture, in­va­sive body searches, forced abor­tions and even rape by the au­thor­i­ties there.</p>
    <p>All of the women even­tu­ally man­aged to de­fect to South Korea.</p>
    <p>“I did not sleep and worked be­cause I did not want to be beaten. It was ex­cru­ci­at­ing to a level that I even at­tempted to com­mit sui­cide,” one woman was quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>North Korea did not im­me­di­ately re­act to the re­port but it has pre­vi­ously called crit­i­cism over its hu­man rights record a “plot to over­throw” its regime.</p>
    <p>An­other woman re­called one of her first nights in de­ten­tion in 2010 when she was raped by an of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“He threat­ened that... I would be hu­mil­i­ated if I re­jected him. He even told me he could help me to be re­leased sooner if I did as he said,” she said.</p>
    <p>Gath­er­ing in­for­ma­tion in iso­lated North Korea is no­to­ri­ously dif­fi­cult, and the re­port ac­knowl­edged the lack of ac­cess to the coun­try lim­ited the agency’s abil­ity to ver­ify the in­ter­vie­wees’ ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Collinge, a UN hu­man rights of­fi­cer who co-au­thored the re­port, said the project was aimed at putting pres­sure on Py­ongyang to im­prove the sit­u­a­tion, while urg­ing other coun­tries not to de­port de­fec­tors who risk their lives to achieve free­dom and pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Moon Jae-in gov­ern­ment, which is try­ing to im­prove ties with the North, re­cently came un­der crit­i­cism af­ter re­vok­ing the li­cences of de­fec­tor groups and ban­ning their cam­paigns to send anti-Py­ongyang pro­pa­ganda leaflets across the bor­der.</p>
