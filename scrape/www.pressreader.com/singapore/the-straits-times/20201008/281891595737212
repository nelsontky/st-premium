    <p>WASHINGTON • Six states in the US have re­ported record num­bers of hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients, in­clud­ing Wis­con­sin where of­fi­cials have is­sued a new or­der lim­it­ing the size of in­door pub­lic gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>The surge of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and new cases in some states co­in­cides with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and sev­eral mem­bers of his White House staff test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s doc­tors on Tues­day said he was not dis­play­ing any acute symp­toms af­ter he left the Wal­ter Reed Med­i­cal Cen­tre where he had been treated for three days.</p>
    <p>The spike in re­ported hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions on Mon­day has hit states in the Mid­west the hard­est, with Mon­tana, Ne­braska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wy­oming re­port­ing their high­est fig­ures, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin has 782 hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients, up from 433 two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>The state’s De­part­ment of Health Ser­vices on Tues­day is­sued a di­rec­tive that gath­er­ings will be lim­ited to no more than 25 per cent of a room or build­ing’s to­tal oc­cu­pancy.</p>
    <p>“We’re in a cri­sis right now and need to im­me­di­ately change our be­hav­iour to save lives,” Wis­con­sin Gov­er­nor Tony Evers said in a state­ment. “We are con­tin­u­ing to ex­pe­ri­ence a surge in cases and many of our hos­pi­tals are over­whelmed, and I be­lieve lim­it­ing in­door pub­lic gath­er­ings will help slow the spread of this virus,” he added.</p>
    <p>In New York, Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo an­nounced new re­stric­tions as the state has seen new hot spots pop up in and around New York City, the hard­est-hit metropoli­tan area in the United States.</p>
    <p>Among the “in­tense” clus­ter ar­eas that will need to ap­ply the gov­er­nor’s strictest new shut­down or­ders are parts of Brook­lyn and Queens, as well as parts of Rock­land and Orange coun­ties.</p>
    <p>The new re­stric­tions af­fect houses of wor­ship the most – those in hot spots are now re­quired to op­er­ate at 25 per cent of ca­pac­ity, with a max­i­mum of 10 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Schools are be­ing closed in some ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Mr Cuomo said that while the new re­stric­tions are nec­es­sary – they were “only as good as they’re en­forced, and a lack of en­force­ment has con­trib­uted to this prob­lem”. He added that “there is no way we didn’t see this com­ing”.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases are reach­ing three-month highs in New York, New Jersey and Connecticu­t, mark­ing the re­turn of the virus to a re­gion that has al­ready suf­fered Amer­ica’s heav­i­est toll from the virus.</p>
    <p>The strain on the health­care sys­tem is so far lim­ited com­pared with the dis­as­ters of March and April, but the trend is con­cern­ing.</p>
    <p>Newly re­ported cases in the three states have roughly dou­bled in a month. The new cases have sig­nif­i­cantly ex­ceeded any in­crease in test­ing, as shown by the ra­tio of pos­i­tives to over­all tests, ac­cord­ing to Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity data.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions re­cently hit a seven-week high in New Jersey, a 10-week high in New York and a 31/ 2- month high in Connecticu­t, ac­cord­ing to Covid Track­ing Project data.</p>
    <p>The news was bet­ter far­ther north – such as in Maine, where the gov­er­nor has out­lined the next re­open­ing steps.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Janet Mills said Maine was mov­ing into the fourth stage of restart­ing the state’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>As of next Tues­day, the gov­er­nor said, churches, restau­rants and cin­e­mas in the state would be al­lowed to op­er­ate at 50 per cent ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of di­ag­nosed Covid-19 in­fec­tions in the United States is an es­ti­mated 7.5 mil­lion, and more than 210,900 peo­ple have died in the pan­demic, the high­est tally in the world.</p>
