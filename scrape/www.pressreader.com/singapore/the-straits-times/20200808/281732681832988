    <p>ellers re­turn­ing from des­ig­nated risk zones, start­ing to­day, as fears grow over ris­ing case num­bers blamed on sum­mer hol­i­days and lo­cal out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s list of “risk zones” cur­rently in­cludes most nonEuro­pean Union coun­tries, as well as cer­tain prov­inces in Bel­gium and Spain.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bour­ing Aus­tria on Thursday an­nounced it would is­sue a travel warn­ing for main­land Spain, be­com­ing the lat­est coun­try to do so amid a rise in new coro­n­avirus cases in the fel­low EU na­tion.</p>
    <p>Fin­land also in­tro­duced new con­trols on ar­rivals from some EU coun­tries, in­clud­ing Bel­gium, the Nether­lands and An­dorra, putting a stop to tourists ar­riv­ing from there and im­pos­ing a 14-day quar­an­tine on other re­turnees.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is ex­tremely del­i­cate,” said the Fin­nish Health Min­istry’s strate­gic direc­tor Li­isaMaria Voi­pio-Pulkki, adding that</p>
    <p>“some sort of sec­ond stage has be­gun”. “Whether we can ex­pect a smaller wave or a larger wave de­pends on how we re­spond.”</p>
    <p>Nor­way an­nounced on Thursday that France would be con­sid­ered a red zone due to the resur­gence of coro­n­avirus cases there, mean­ing that all trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from France face a manda­tory 10-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land, Monaco and the Czech Repub­lic were also hit with sim­i­lar re­stric­tions, as well as two Swedish re­gions, the Nor­we­gian For­eign Af­fairs Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>“The in­fec­tious sit­u­a­tion can change quickly, as can the re­stric­tions,” Nor­we­gian For­eign Min­is­ter Ine Erik­sen Sor­eide said in a com­mu­nique.</p>
    <p>While much of Europe ap­peared to have brought the pan­demic mostly un­der con­trol with strict lock­downs ear­lier this year, many are see­ing new out­breaks, forc­ing lo­cal or city­wide lock­downs and other quar­an­tine mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Poland will reim­pose com­pul­sory mask-wear­ing in all pub­lic spa­ces in nine dis­tricts, as it saw a record new high in the num­ber of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions will come into force from to­day, and will also af­fect sports and cul­tural events in those ar­eas, mainly in the south and east.</p>
    <p>Greece’s gov­ern­ment on Wed­nes­day an­nounced a “wake-up week” on Covid-19, tight­en­ing re­stric­tions af­ter the steady rise in mostly do­mes­tic in­fec­tions. Of­fi­cials have blamed the in­crease on over­crowd­ing in clubs and so­cial events.</p>
    <p>Scot­land this week al­ready reim­posed re­stric­tions in and around the city of Aberdeen, af­ter a clus­ter of cases was iden­ti­fied there.</p>
    <p>The new out­breaks are forc­ing of­fi­cials into an un­com­fort­able trade­off be­tween health re­quire­ments and the need to bring economies back to life, as busi­nesses and com­pa­nies strug­gle with huge losses af­ter ini­tial lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Ger­man air­line gi­ant Lufthansa be­came the lat­est to re­veal the fall­out from the pan­demic, an­nounc­ing forced lay­offs and a €1.5 bil­lion (S$2.4 bil­lion) loss in the sec­ond quar­ter as the pan­demic hit travel.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing its worst quar­ter in the com­pany’s his­tory, Lufthansa said that in the three months to June, its pas­sen­ger num­bers had col­lapsed by 96 per cent com­pared with last year as lock­downs cur­tailed air travel world­wide.</p>
    <p>Among the few re­cip­i­ents of the “Level 1” rank­ing – which means no spe­cial con­cerns for travel – were Tai­wan, which has won wide ac­claim for its han­dling of the pan­demic, and Aus­tralia.</p>
