    <p>The Ja­panese city of Nagasaki yes­ter­day com­mem­o­rated the 75th an­niver­sary of its de­struc­tion by a US atomic bomb, with its mayor and the head of the United Na­tions warn­ing against a nu­clear arms race.

    <p>NAGASAKI/TOKYO • The Ja­panese city of Nagasaki yes­ter­day com­mem­o­rated the 75th an­niver­sary of its de­struc­tion by a US atomic bomb, with its mayor and the head of the United Na­tions warn­ing against a nu­clear arms race.</p>
    <p>Nagasaki was flat­tened i n an atomic in­ferno three days af­ter a sim­i­lar at­tack on Hiroshima – twin strikes that rang in the nu­clear age and gave Ja­pan the bleak dis­tinc­tion of be­ing the only coun­try to be struck by atomic weapons.</p>
    <p>Sur­vivors, their rel­a­tives and a hand­ful of for­eign dig­ni­taries at­tended a cer­e­mony in Nagasaki where they called for world peace. Par­tic­i­pants of­fered a silent prayer at 11.02am, the time the sec­ond and last nu­clear weapon used i n wartime was dropped over the city.</p>
    <p>“The true horror of nu­clear weapons has not yet been ad­e­quately con­veyed to the world at large” de­spite decades of ef­fort by sur­vivors telling of their “hel­lish ex­pe­ri­ence”, said Nagasaki Mayor Tomi­hisa Taue in a speech.</p>
    <p>“If, as with the coro­n­avirus – which we did not fear un­til it be­gan to spread among our im­me­di­ate sur­round­ings – hu­man­ity does not be­come aware of the threat of nu­clear weapons un­til they are used again, we will find our­selves in an ir­rev­o­ca­ble predica­ment.”</p>
    <p>UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res, in a mes­sage read by his un­der­sec­re­tary Izumi Nakamitsu, warned that “the prospect of nu­clear weapons be­ing used in­ten­tion­ally, by ac­ci­dent or mis­cal­cu­la­tion, is dan­ger­ously high”. He said: “The his­toric progress in nu­clear dis­ar­ma­ment is in jeop­ardy... This alarm­ing trend must be re­versed.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of par­tic­i­pants in this year’s cer­e­mony was re­duced to roughly one-tenth the fig­ure in pre­vi­ous years due to coro­n­avirus fears, with pro­ceed­ings broad­cast live on­line in Ja­panese and English.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe re­freshed his pledge that Ja­pan would lead “the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity’s ef­forts to­wards the re­al­i­sa­tion of a nu­clear-free world”. The re­mem­brance comes as wor­ries linger over the nu­clear threat from</p>
    <p>North Korea and grow­ing ten­sions be­tween the US and China over is­sues in­clud­ing se­cu­rity and trade.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Abe will re­frain from visiting the Ya­sukuni shrine for war dead on the 75th an­niver­sary of Ja­pan’s de­feat in World War II, Jiji news agency said yes­ter­day, but he will make an of­fer­ing on that day, as he has done in the past.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s last visit to the shrine, soon af­ter he took of­fice in De­cem­ber 2013, caused out­rage in China and South Korea, which see the vis­its as a sign that Ja­pan has not re­pented for its mil­i­tarist past and war atroc­i­ties.</p>
