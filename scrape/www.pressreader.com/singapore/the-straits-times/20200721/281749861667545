    <p>NEW YORK • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s fail­ure to con­tain the coro­n­avirus out­break and his re­fusal to pro­mote clear pub­lic health guide­lines have left many se­nior Repub­li­cans de­spair­ing that he will ever play a con­struc­tive role in ad­dress­ing the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Some of them have con­cluded that they must work around Mr Trump and ig­nore or even con­tra­dict his pro­nounce­ments.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, sev­eral of the most prom­i­nent fig­ures in the Repub­li­can party out­side the White House have bro­ken ranks with Mr Trump over is­sues such as the value of wear­ing a mask in pub­lic and heed­ing the ad­vice of health ex­perts such as Dr An­thony Fauci, who the Pres­i­dent and other hard-right fig­ures within the ad­min­is­tra­tion have sub­jected to caus­tic per­sonal crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>They ap­pear to be spurred by sev­eral over­lap­ping forces, in­clud­ing de­te­ri­o­rat­ing con­di­tions in their own states, Mr Trump’s seem­ing in­dif­fer­ence to the prob­lem and the ap­proach of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in which Mr Trump is badly lag­ging his Demo­cratic challenger Joe Bi­den in the polls.</p>
    <p>Once-ret­i­cent Repub­li­can gov­er­nors are now is­su­ing or­ders on mask-wear­ing and busi­ness re­stric­tions that run counter to Mr Trump’s de­mands.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese gov­er­nors have been hold­ing latenight phone calls among them­selves to trade ideas and griev­ances; they have sought out part­ners in the ad­min­is­tra­tion other than the Pres­i­dent, in­clud­ing Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, who, de­spite echo­ing Mr Trump in pub­lic, is seen by gov­er­nors as far more at­ten­tive to the con­tin­u­ing dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent got bored with it,” Mr David Car­ney, an ad­viser to Texas Gov­er­nor Greg Ab­bott, a Repub­li­can, said of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A hand­ful of Repub­li­can law­mak­ers in the Se­nate have pri­vately pressed the ad­min­is­tra­tion to bring back health brief­ings led by fig­ures such as Dr Fauci and Dr Deb­o­rah Birx, who reg­u­larly up­dated the pub­lic dur­ing the spring un­til Mr Trump up­staged them with his own briefing-room mono­logues.</p>
    <p>And in the state of Ken­tucky last week, Sen­a­tor Mitch McCon­nell, the ma­jor­ity leader, broke with Mr Trump on nearly every ma­jor is­sue re­lated to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The straight talk here that ev­ery­one needs to un­der­stand is: This is not go­ing away un­til we get a vac­cine,” Mr McCon­nell said on Wed­nes­day, con­tra­dict­ing Mr Trump’s rosy pre­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is a quiet but widen­ing breach between Mr Trump and lead­ing fig­ures in his party, as the virus burns through ma­jor po­lit­i­cal bat­tle­grounds in the south and the west, such as in the states of Ari­zona, Texas and Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>The emerg­ing rifts in Mr Trump’s party have been slow to de­velop, but they have rapidly deep­ened since a new surge in coro­n­avirus cases be­gan to sweep the coun­try last month.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nal days of last month, Utah Gov­er­nor Gary Herbert, a Repub­li­can, joined other gov­er­nors on a con­fer­ence call with Mr Pence and urged the ad­min­is­tra­tion to do more to com­bat a sense of “com­pla­cency” about the virus. Mr Herbert said it would help states like his own if Mr Trump and Mr Pence were to en­cour­age mask-wear­ing on a na­tional scale, ac­cord­ing to a record­ing of the call.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence told Mr Herbert that the sug­ges­tion was “duly noted”, and said that mask-wear­ing would be a “very con­sis­tent mes­sage” from the ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In a Fox in­ter­view that was broad­cast on Sun­day, Mr Trump said he would not is­sue a na­tional mask or­der be­cause Amer­i­cans de­serve “a cer­tain free­dom” on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Some of the states where out­breaks have wors­ened most in re­cent weeks are led by Repub­li­cans who spent months avoid­ing strin­gent lock­downs, in some cases be­cause state lead­ers were un­easy about cre­at­ing space between them­selves and a pres­i­dent of their own party who re­jected such steps.</p>
    <p>That dy­namic has been par­tic­u­larly pro­nounced in south­ern states such as Mis­sis­sippi, Alabama and Florida, where gov­er­nors have ei­ther con­tin­ued to re­sist tough pub­lic health re­stric­tions or have only re­cently and par­tially em­braced them.</p>
