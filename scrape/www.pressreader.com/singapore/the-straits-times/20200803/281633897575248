    <p>Sur­vival has be­come the key con­cern for many small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) here as they strug­gle to keep afloat amid the eco­nomic fall­out from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>While some own­ers have fran­ti­cally be­gun di­ver­si­fy­ing busi­ness of­fer­ings, oth­ers have taken on odd jobs to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>Florist Pang Hui Ya, who co-owns 7pm Bloom, typ­i­fies the chal­lenges faced by thou­sands of firms.</p>
    <p>She told The Straits Times that turnover has fallen by around 80 per cent ow­ing to wed­ding can­cel­la­tions in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>“The bulk of our busi­ness comes from do­ing flo­ral ar­range­ments for weddings, so dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, we fo­cused more on sell­ing ready-made bou­quets, but the rev­enue from that barely cov­ers our costs,” said Ms Pang, 30.</p>
    <p>Even the spike in de­mand dur­ing Mother’s Day failed to cover rent and staff costs, she noted.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness also en­coun­tered other hur­dles, from un­suc­cess­ful ap­pli­ca­tions for gov­ern­ment grants and fi­nan­cial aid to los­ing its rented store space – set­backs that have forced Ms Pang to dig into her sav­ings and take on part-time jobs.</p>
    <p>But the busi­ness is get­ting back on its feet again with a new store space at Ox­ley BizHub, and de­mand is grad­u­ally pick­ing up with more wed­ding cer­e­monies.</p>
    <p>Ms Pang hopes the eas­ing up of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures – up to 50 peo­ple can now at­tend weddings – will trans­late into re­vived de­mand.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, she is look­ing at di­ver­si­fy­ing by hold­ing flo­ral ar­range­ment classes and rolling out do-it-your­self flower jars.</p>
    <p>Other busi­ness own­ers are also fo­cused on rid­ing out each month as it comes.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue at Mr Rudy de Rozario’s event sup­port firm Drape Em­pire plunged by around 90 per cent af­ter al­most all events were can­celled.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which sets up drapes and back­drops for events such as con­certs and cor­po­rate func­tions, qual­i­fied for the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) for its four em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>But Mr de Rozario, 43, is hes­i­tant about be­ing overly re­liant on fi­nan­cial aid: “The pay­outs are only till Oc­to­ber, and (there are) other costs like rent, so we need to pivot into other ar­eas for in­come to en­sure month-to-month sus­tain­abil­ity un­til busi­ness picks up pace again.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany re­cently took on two tech­ni­cal in­stal­la­tion projects as well as odd jobs like e-com­merce de­liv­er­ies to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit noted that “mi­cro and small en­ter­prises with more lim­ited re­sources are ad­versely af­fected com­pared with larger com­pa­nies”, though the JSS has helped them meet cash flow and cost chal­lenges, es­pe­cially dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>He added that the Gov­ern­ment had ad­justed JSS pay­outs to sup­port qual­i­fied share­holder-di­rec­tors in ad­di­tion to em­ploy­ees, recog­nis­ing that many of them are from small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Wee Kien Meng, who co-owns party plan­ner Mr Bot­tle Kid’s Party, found him­self in­el­i­gi­ble for JSS pay­outs as his busi­ness was reg­is­tered as a lim­ited li­a­bil­ity part­ner­ship, mean­ing that he draws monthly in­come as a “free­lancer”, not as a share­holder-di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>He was also in­el­i­gi­ble for the Selfem­ployed In­come Re­lief Scheme de­spite the firm’s rev­enue fall­ing al­most 95 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee, 42, moved his busi­ness into the dig­i­tal realm af­ter a string of party can­cel­la­tions, and now of­fers dis­counted pack­ages such as on­line magic shows and work­shops.</p>
    <p>“Though we are get­ting small suc­cesses from th­ese strate­gies, the rev­enue is nowhere close to what we used to have, as par­ties are typ­i­cally held in large num­bers and some par­ents are not as keen to do vir­tual par­ties for their kids,” Mr Wee said.</p>
    <p>Mr Kurt Wee, pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises, said that while con­tin­ued gov­ern­ment sup­port is es­sen­tial in help­ing SMEs cut costs and in­crease rev­enue, fund­ing should be di­rected at busi­nesses that would still be vi­able be­yond the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This means firms must thor­oughly as­sess their own “de­vel­op­men­tal po­ten­tial, tak­ing into ac­count the sec­tor that they are in, and whether the busi­ness it­self has strong fun­da­men­tals”, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Once this has been es­tab­lished, busi­nesses can then con­sider how they can di­ver­sify and grow their rev­enue streams amid Covid-19, tak­ing into ac­count the cost com­po­nents and the gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes they are el­i­gi­ble for.”</p>
    <p>This “will help them come up with a plan – which should last at least to the end of 2021 – on how they can tide through this Covid-19 pe­riod”.</p>
