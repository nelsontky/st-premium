    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s vi­sion of a mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety is en­shrined in the na­tional pledge: “One united peo­ple re­gard­less of race, lan­guage or re­li­gion.” Even though Sin­ga­pore has made sig­nif­i­cant progress in real­is­ing this vi­sion, the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion put the spot­light on long-held as­sump­tions about race and lan­guage in pol­i­tics. Younger vot­ers sig­nalled greater open­ness to­wards dis­cussing such is­sues in a way that older gen­er­a­tions would have con­sid­ered taboo or po­lar­is­ing. The Raeesah Khan in­ci­dent high­lighted how younger Sin­ga­pore­ans, in par­tic­u­lar, did not like how the Gov­ern­ment came down hard on those who asked dif­fi­cult ques­tions – rightly or wrongly – about whether cer­tain races are treated dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties have sig­nalled a will­ing­ness to en­gage in more of th­ese dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions. Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said in an e-rally that while the coun­try has em­pha­sised racial tol­er­ance and har­mony so far, it can do bet­ter and go be­yond that; while Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said it is clear the younger gen­er­a­tion takes a dif­fer­ent ap­proach to race re­la­tions, and there has to be a frame­work that takes into ac­count a suit­able ap­proach and the trade­offs. Younger party can­di­dates also pointed out that some of the ideas be­ing talked about now arose be­cause of the time that young peo­ple are spend­ing on­line con­sum­ing in­for­ma­tion from Western coun­tries.</p>
    <p>While some Sin­ga­pore­ans have latched on to move­ments and ideas in the West, such as Black Lives Mat­ter and white priv­i­lege, it is worth think­ing more crit­i­cally about whether they are rel­e­vant to the na­tion’s own his­tor­i­cal con­text. Every coun­try has its own cul­ture and ex­pe­ri­ences, and not every so­cial trend else­where can be trans­posed lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, it was only half a cen­tury ago that older gen­er­a­tions wit­nessed the Maria Her­togh ri­ots and the race ri­ots of the 1960s. Sin­ga­pore has not ar­rived at a post-racial state. Long­stand­ing poli­cies such as the HDB eth­nic quota and In­ter-Re­li­gious and Racial Con­fi­dence Cir­cles, tri­par­tite guide­lines on fair em­ploy­ment prac­tices, as well as ef­forts by schools to pro­mote racial har­mony, show that the pre­sent peace and sta­bil­ity is not a given and has to be worked at con­tin­u­ally.</p>
    <p>As so­ci­ety evolves and more young Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­press opin­ions at the bal­lot box, it is timely to re­visit some estab­lished norms. But in­stead of tough sanc­tions, those who steer con­ver­sa­tions on race must lis­ten ac­tively and ad­vise on why a par­tic­u­lar ac­tion is mis­guided. In schools, there will be spe­cial­ist teach­ers trained to fa­cil­i­tate th­ese dis­cus­sions. Younger Sin­ga­pore­ans, too, should aim not to re­peat the painful mis­steps of the past. Sin­ga­pore­ans should not seek to forge a new path with­out un­der­stand­ing how their past is in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked to their pre­sent and fu­ture.</p>
