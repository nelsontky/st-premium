    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land is turn­ing to a less-trav­elled path to by­pass sup­ply chain road­blocks and de­liver per­ish­ables to China, its big­gest cus­tomer in Asia.</p>
    <p>Most agri­cul­tural and food prod­ucts have tra­di­tion­ally been de­liv­ered to China from Thai farms and ware­houses by trucks go­ing through ei­ther Viet­nam or Laos, or by ships and air­planes.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic has up­ended lo­gis­tics world­wide, re­sult­ing in bor­der de­lays, fewer flights and dif­fi­culty han­dling items that are not suited for sea ves­sels.</p>
    <p>One solution sur­faced this month, when Thai­land be­gan a two-mode sys­tem by truck­ing prod­ucts to Viet­nam, then mov­ing the goods into con­tain­ers on trains, which com­plete the de­liv­er­ies to China.</p>
    <p>It may sound sim­ple.</p>
    <p>But this is some­thing that has never been done be­fore, ac­cord­ing to Mr Nara­pat Kaeothong, Vice-Min­is­ter for Agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“Trans­port­ing by rail is now cheaper and faster than by trucks, so we have es­sen­tially re­duced over­all costs and de­liv­ery time,” Mr Nara­pat said in an in­ter­view in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>“This could be­come a new sys­tem for our ship­ments. We can build on this idea and ex­port more prod­ucts at less cost.”</p>
    <p>There is as yet no di­rect train route that links Thai­land and China, but a plan to con­nect the two coun­tries via rail is in the works.</p>
    <p>China is Thai­land’s No. 2 ex­port mar­ket after the US, ac­cord­ing to Com­merce Min­istry data.</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent of farm prod­ucts from Thai­land have tra­di­tion­ally been trans­ported by land to China.</p>
    <p>Trop­i­cal fruit in­clud­ing durian, man­gos­teen and lon­gan are among the key – and most vul­ner­a­ble – items.</p>
    <p>Thai ex­ports to China i ncreased 15.3 per cent by value in May from the same month a year ear­lier, com­pared with a 22.5 per cent drop in to­tal ex­ports.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s trade- and tourism­re­liant econ­omy is fac­ing its deep­est con­trac­tion i n more than two decades, with the cen­tral bank pre­dict­ing gross do­mes­tic prod­uct to shrink by a record 8.1 per cent.</p>
