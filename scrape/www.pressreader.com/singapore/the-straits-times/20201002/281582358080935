    <p>MPs have var­i­ous av­enues to raise is­sues in Par­lia­ment be­yond sub­mit­ting ad­journ­ment mo­tions, said Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin yes­ter­day. The is­sue came un­der the spot­light af­ter Mr Tan re­vealed that Work­ers’ Party MP Sylvia Lim’s ad­journ­ment mo­tion on en­hanc­ing eq­uity in the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem was not se­lected in a bal­lot.</p>
    <p>MPs have var­i­ous av­enues to raise is­sues in Par­lia­ment be­yond sub­mit­ting ad­journ­ment mo­tions, said Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan ChuanJin yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, they can choose to put forth a sub­stan­tive mo­tion or file par­lia­men­tary ques­tions, he added in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>The is­sue has come un­der the spot­light in the past week af­ter Mr</p>
    <p>Tan re­vealed that Work­ers’ Party MP Sylvia Lim’s ad­journ­ment mo­tion on en­hanc­ing eq­uity in the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem was not se­lected in a bal­lot held on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim had hoped to raise the is­sue fol­low­ing the high-pro­file court case in­volv­ing for­mer maid Parti Liyani, who was ini­tially found guilty of steal­ing $34,000 worth of items from the fam­ily of her for­mer em­ployer, prom­i­nent busi­ness­man Liew Mun Leong.</p>
    <p>Her sub­se­quent ac­quit­tal by the High Court has raised ques­tions about the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem’s treat­ment of peo­ple who are less well-off.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Mr Tan said Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng’s ad­journ­ment mo­tion on sec­ond-hand ci­garette smoke in homes was picked in the bal­lot.</p>
    <p>This prompted Non-Con­stituency MP (NCMP) Leong Mun Wai to ask in a post on his so­cial me­dia pages why sec­ond-hand smoke was deemed “more i mpor­tant” than crim­i­nal jus­tice.</p>
    <p>He noted that with five ad­journ­ment mo­tions sub­mit­ted, Ms Lim stood only a 20 per cent chance of be­ing drawn in the bal­lot, “al­though most Sin­ga­pore­ans would prob­a­bly pre­fer the Parti Liyani case to be heard first be­fore sec­ond-hand smoke or any of the other mat­ters raised by the PAP MPs”.</p>
    <p>The Progress Sin­ga­pore Party NCMPs will raise the is­sue of par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings not giv­ing pri­or­ity to the more im­por­tant is­sues of the day, Mr Leong said.</p>
    <p>Free­lance jour­nal­ist Kirsten Han also asked if Mr Ng could cede his slot to Ms Lim, adding that “surely the is­sue of eq­uity in the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem is very much ur­gent and cur­rent now”.</p>
    <p>An ad­journ­ment mo­tion is typ­i­cally filed by an MP who wishes to speak at the end of a par­lia­men­tary sit­ting on a topic for which the Govern­ment is re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>If more than one MP files an ad­journ­ment mo­tion, bal­lot­ing takes place. Those who are not picked can opt to re­sub­mit their ad­journ­ment mo­tions for bal­lot­ing on another day.</p>
    <p>“Bal­lot­ing gives equal chance for any no­tice of a topic an MP wishes to raise to be picked and de­bated in due course,” said the Par­lia­ment of Sin­ga­pore in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>“It is a fair and trans­par­ent process free from any bias or pre­de­ter­mi­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>In his lat­est post, Mr Tan noted that “a fair num­ber” of par­lia­men­tary ques­tions have been raised over Ms Parti’s case by mem­bers from all sides of the House.</p>
    <p>Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam has also said he will be de­liv­er­ing a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the mat­ter this month.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Mr Ng said he has filed a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion on whether the Home Af­fairs Min­istry will con­sider al­low­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers and other work per­mit hold­ers to be ac­com­pa­nied by non-le­gal per­son­nel in po­lice in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally is not a case of ei­ther or,” he said, re­fer­ring to Ms Parti’s case and the is­sue of sec­ond-hand smoke. “I will speak up on both is­sues and both im­por­tant is­sues will be de­bated.”</p>
    <p>FAIR AND TRANS­PAR­ENT PROCESS</p>
    <p>Bal­lot­ing gives equal chance for any no­tice of a topic an MP wishes to raise to be picked and de­bated in due course. It is a fair and trans­par­ent process free from any bias or pre-de­ter­mi­na­tion.</p>
