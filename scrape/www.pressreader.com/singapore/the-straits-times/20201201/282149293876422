    <p>Na­tion­al­ity is not a fac­tor con­sid­ered in the sched­ul­ing of ex­e­cu­tions, coun­sel from the At­tor­ney­Gen­eral’s Cham­bers said yes­ter­day, in the case of a con­victed Sin­ga­porean drug traf­ficker who is chal­leng­ing a de­ci­sion by the au­thor­i­ties to carry out his hang­ing ahead of other death-row in­mates.</p>
    <p>Syed Suhail Syed Zin, 44, who is rep­re­sented by lawyer M. Ravi, al­leged that there was dis­crim­i­na­tion based on na­tion­al­ity be­cause he was sched­uled to be hanged ahead of Malaysian drug traf­ficker Datchi­na­murthy Kata­iah, who was given the death sen­tence be­fore him.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Se­nior State Coun­sel Fran­cis Ng told the High Court Datchi­na­murthy’s ex­e­cu­tion had not been sched­uled be­cause he was af­fected by a sep­a­rate case that was pend­ing a de­ci­sion by the Court of Ap­peal. In that case, Malaysian drug run­ner Gobi Ave­dian, who is also rep­re­sented by Mr Ravi, es­caped the gal­lows on Oct 19 af­ter he suc­ceeded in get­ting the apex court to re­view his con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said Suhail’s be­lief that for­eign­ers and Sin­ga­pore­ans were be­ing treated dif­fer­ently was “un­founded” and Mr Ravi’s al­le­ga­tions that the Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice (SPS) was bi­ased against Sin­ga­pore­ans was “empty rhetoric”.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice See Kee Oon will give his de­ci­sion on Suhail’s ap­pli­ca­tion for ju­di­cial re­view at a later date.</p>
    <p>Suhail was given the manda­tory death penalty on Dec 2, 2015, for traf­fick­ing 38.84g of heroin. His ap­peal was dis­missed and his pe­ti­tion for clemency was re­jected.</p>
    <p>On Sept 11 this year, he was told that he would be hanged on Sept 18. Mr Ravi then ap­plied for per­mis­sion from the High Court for ju­di­cial re­view of the SPS de­ci­sion on the sched­ul­ing of his ex­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Ravi men­tioned a death-row in­mate, Sin­ga­porean Ma­soud Rahimi Mehrzad, in ar­gu­ing that Suhail was sched­uled to be hanged ahead of those sen­tenced be­fore him. Mr Ng said sched­ul­ing was car­ried out in a “prin­ci­pled and ra­tio­nal man­ner” and there were good rea­sons why the ex­e­cu­tions of Datchi­na­murthy and Ma­soud were not sched­uled ahead of Suhail’s.</p>
