    <p>Lo­cal ac­tor Suhaimi Yu­sof makes sure that he con­tin­ues to be “the No.1 in­flu­encer” in his fam­ily even though his chil­dren have grown up. They are Amirul, 25, Nur­jan­nah, 24, and Sufi, 20.</p>
    <p>“I’m con­stantly com­pet­ing with the rest of the so­cial me­dia en­thu­si­asts with their views of life. But I’m cer­tainly not in favour of neg­a­tive in­flu­ences that will end up chang­ing the per­son I have groomed over the years,” the 51-year-old tells The Sun­day</p>
    <p>Times.</p>
    <p>The top par­ent­ing chal­lenge is to keep up with the com­mu­ni­ca­tion style and mode, he says. “When I was grow­ing up, my par­ents used to have a sim­pler way of send­ing a mes­sage when I crossed the line: Pack your stuff, come home for din­ner and lis­ten to us. That’s it. Their way or the high­way.”</p>
    <p>Things are dif­fer­ent now. He adds: “Kids are stay­ing in­doors, but mix­ing around with the whole world. As a par­ent, I have to up­grade my strat­egy in win­ning the in­flu­ence over my kids’ minds.”</p>
    <p>That means he has to be cre­ative in com­ing up with ideas for fam­ily time.</p>
    <p>“I have es­tab­lished our own weekly ‘non-elec­tronic fam­ily meet­ings’ in which we chat without any mo­bile de­vices for half a day. And we make time for it.”</p>
