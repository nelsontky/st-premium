    <p>The own­ers of a house in Jalan Kayu es­tate who built a metal gate, two bound­ary walls and a fence around the landed prop­erty have been charged with en­croach­ing on state land.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Tues­day, the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA) said that it had in 2013 in­structed the own­ers, Tan Teck Siong and his wife Cheah Mee Poh, to re­move the struc­tures as na­tional wa­ter agency PUB was car­ry­ing out drainage im­prove­ment works in the es­tate.</p>
    <p>The struc­tures at the house, which is at the end of Jalan Tari Zapin, are said to have been built in De­cem­ber 2005.</p>
    <p>Tan, 61, and Cheah, 59, have agreed to de­mol­ish the struc­tures, said the state­ment, which was is­sued jointly with the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>The de­mo­li­tion works are on­go­ing and SLA is await­ing con­fir­ma­tion from the own­ers’ reg­is­tered sur­veyor that all the struc­tures have been re­moved, it added.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple face one charge each un­der the State Lands En­croach­ments Act for hav­ing the com­mon in­ten­tion to un­law­fully en­ter into pos­ses­sion of state land by en­clos­ing a 144.2 sq m plot of state land with the gate, walls and fence.</p>
    <p>The charges were filed against them in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, any­one con­victed of the of­fence can be sen­tenced to a fine of up to $5,000 or jail of up to six months, or both.</p>
    <p>Tan also faces four charges for mak­ing false dec­la­ra­tions in his ca­pac­ity as the qual­i­fied per­son, or QP, who is re­spon­si­ble for en­sur­ing that works at the house are car­ried out in line with build­ing reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Build­ing Con­trol Act, a QP is an ar­chi­tect or pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer.</p>
    <p>The state­ment said that in his ca­pac­ity as the QP, Tan made dec­la­ra­tions to the Com­mis­sioner of Build­ing Con­trol that there were no de­vi­a­tions in his build­ing works from the ap­proved plans.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, two of the dec­la­ra­tions were made in an ap­pli­ca­tion for a tem­po­rary oc­cu­pa­tion per­mit in July 2005.</p>
    <p>The other two dec­la­ra­tions were made in De­cem­ber 2005 when he was ob­tain­ing ap­proval for a cer­tifi­cate of statu­tory com­ple­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, a per­son who is con­victed of mak­ing a false dec­la­ra­tion to the Com­mis­sioner of Build­ing Con­trol can be sen­tenced to a fine of up to $10,000 or jail of up to six months, or both.</p>
    <p>The case was men­tioned in the State Courts on Tues­day and has been ad­journed to Aug 25.</p>
