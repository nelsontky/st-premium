    <p>HONG KONG • Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping may no longer be re­ferred to as “Pres­i­dent Xi” in Wash­ing­ton if US law­mak­ers get their way, in a move cer­tain to anger Bei­jing amid ris­ing ten­sions be­tween the two sides.</p>
    <p>The Name the En­emy Act would re­quire of­fi­cial US gov­ern­ment com­mu­ni­ca­tions to re­fer to the top</p>
    <p>TOKYO • A Ja­panese group is try­ing to take peo­ple’s minds off the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – by putting them in coffins sur­rounded by chain­sawwield­ing zom­bies.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers in Tokyo can lie in a win­dowed box, lis­ten­ing to a hor­ror story, watch­ing ac­tors per­form and get­ting poked with fake hands and squirted with water.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic is stress­ful, and we hope peo­ple can get a bit of re­lief by hav­ing a good scream,” said Mr Kenta Iwana, co­or­di­na­tor of pro­duc­tion firm Kowa­garase­tai, which is putting on the 15-minute shows.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese word kowa­garase­tai trans­lates to scare squad in English.</p>
    <p>As Ja­pan ex­pe­ri­ences a Covid-19 up­swing, Mr Iwana, 25, is scram­bling to find work for his ac­tors, who nor­mally per­form at venues such as theme parks.</p>
    <p>Last month, he of­fered drive-in hor­ror shows.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers, too, are look­ing for a way to blow off steam.</p>
    <p>“Lots of events have been can­celled be­cause of the coro­n­avirus, and I was look­ing for a way to get rid of my stress,” said Mr Kazushiro Hashiguchi, 36, after leader of China ac­cord­ing to his role as head of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP). For Mr Xi, the ti­tle would be CCP gen­eral sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>The Bill, in­tro­duced by Repub­li­can Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Scott Perry of Penn­syl­va­nia on Aug 7, “(pro­hibits) the use of fed­eral funds to re­fer to the head of state of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China as ‘pres­i­dent’ on the 800 yen (S$10) show.</p>
    <p>“I feel re­laxed now,” he said. Cus­tomers for the shows, held in a rest lounge usu­ally used by pas­sen­gers ar­riv­ing in the cap­i­tal on</p>
    <p>United States Gov­ern­ment doc­u­ments and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, and for other pur­poses”.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers of the Bill say the term “pres­i­dent” “of­fers un­war­ranted le­git­i­macy to an un­elected leader”, ac­cord­ing to a South China Morning Post (SCMP) re­port on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>While the Bill has yet to be passed, ob­servers noted that some overnight bus trips, in­clude mall own­ers and op­er­a­tors of other venues whom Mr Iwana hopes will host his mo­bile shows.</p>
    <p>“We needed to have some­thing</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, have started re­fer­ring to Mr Xi as gen­eral sec­re­tary, in­stead of pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi is the gen­eral sec­re­tary of the CCP, chair­man of the CCP Cen­tral Mil­i­tary Com­mis­sion, Pres­i­dent of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China (PRC), and chair­man of the PRC Cen­tral Mil­i­tary Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has ap­par­ently not re­ferred to Mr Xi as gen­eral sec­re­tary so far.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Trump has made his tough po­si­tions on China a key el­e­ment in the run-up to the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. The US leader, who used to re­peat­edly call Mr Xi his “friend”, soured on the that we could take any­where, and coffins are easy to move,” Mr Iwana said. “It’s good busi­ness for us and sat­is­fy­ing for our cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>US-China re­la­tion­ship, which has seen a series of flash points, in­clud­ing China’s han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“China’s bla­tant dis­hon­esty to­wards the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity cost lives, and the CCP and (the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion) must be held ac­count­able for their fail­ures,” SCMP cited Mr Perry– who faces a close race for his Penn­syl­va­nia seat in Novem­ber – as say­ing in May.</p>
    <p>It is not known how much sup­port Mr Perry will get from his col­leagues over the Bill in the few months left to this con­gres­sional ses­sion, which will be fo­cused more on ef­forts to bat­tle Covid-19.</p>
