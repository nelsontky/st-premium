    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Ser­vice is all-im­por­tant. Help those who need it most and see if you can get your cus­tomers or fam­ily to tell you what they re­ally want.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>It is all about so­cial­is­ing, so pay closer at­ten­tion to your peo­ple and see what you can do for them. It is not all just fun, though.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to clear up com­mu­ni­ca­tions means you might have an empty in-box by the end of the day. It is a great time to get back to old ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You forge a gen­uine con­nec­tion with some­one who did not seem like a good can­di­date for friend­ship – or any­thing else – at one time.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your bud­get needs tweak­ing, so take a good look and fig­ure out how you can make the cash flow start to work for you again.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You amaze your peo­ple with a bold, new achieve­ment – one that should keep them on your side for quite some time.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are a bit over­whelmed with all the noise sur­round­ing you, but that just means you need to drown it out a bit.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your se­cre­tive na­ture works to your ad­van­tage be­cause you man­age to avoid the at­ten­tion of some­one who has got you in his or her sight.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your need to rebel is against your need to get along with oth­ers and that could cause some prob­lems with author­ity fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>It is all about details and your great en­ergy helps you master the lit­tlest of the lit­tle. Im­press your boss or show off to friends.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is de­pleted, but that can be a good thing. All those great ideas you have can fi­nally be put to work. You can also catch up with fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Work on an im­por­tant pro­ject or you will lose in­ter­est half­way through and let it drop. Things are moving for­ward on their own pretty well.</p>
