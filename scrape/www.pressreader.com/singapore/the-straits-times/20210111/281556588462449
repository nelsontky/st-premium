    <p>I was jok­ing by say­ing that when she ar­rived in Pon­tianak we would eat sa­tay to­gether. She con­tacted me via What­sApp at 2.05pm with laugh­ter. She was al­ready board­ing the plane and she said the weather con­di­tions were not good. I said pray a lot, please.</p>
    <p>MR RAFIQ YUSUF AL IDRUS, hus­band of Ms Panca Widiya Nur­santi, a mid­dle-school teacher in Pon­tianak, who was on her way home after a va­ca­tion in her home town of Te­gal in Cen­tral Java.</p>
    <p>JAKARTA • “Bye bye fam­ily. We’re head­ing home for now,” Ms Ratih Win­da­nia posted on In­sta­gram from Jakarta’s air­port with pic­tures of laugh­ing chil­dren and two emo­jis blow­ing kisses.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage was sent just be­fore the plane they boarded left the In­done­sian cap­i­tal last Satur­day and crashed into the sea min­utes after take-off, car­ry­ing 62 pas­sen­gers and crew. “Pray for us,” her brother Ir­fan­syah Riyanto posted on In­sta­gram with a pic­ture of the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties said they have re­cov­ered pieces of wreck­age and body parts yes­ter­day from the wa­ters north of the cap­i­tal where Sri­wi­jaya Air Flight SJ182 dis­ap­peared in rainy weather.</p>
    <p>Like dozens of other des­per­ate rel­a­tives, Mr Ir­fan­syah rushed to Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta In­terna</p>
    <p>LAST CON­TACT WITH WIFE</p>
    <p>tional Air­port late on Satur­day. Yes­ter­day, he was still hop­ing for good news about his sis­ter and four other fam­ily mem­bers on the flight, in­clud­ing his par­ents.</p>
    <p>“We feel pow­er­less; we can only wait and hope to have any in­for­ma­tion soon,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Mr Ir­fan­syah said his rel­a­tives had orig­i­nally been due to take an ear­lier flight op­er­ated by Sri­wi­jaya’s unit NAM Air and he was un­clear why that was changed. His sis­ter and her two chil­dren had been at the end of a three-week hol­i­day and were tak­ing the 740km trip home to Pon­tianak on the is­land of West Kal­i­man­tan.</p>
    <p>“I was the one who drove them to the air­port, helped with the check­ins and the luggage... I feel like I still can’t be­lieve this and it hap­pened too fast,” Mr Ir­fan­syah said.</p>
    <p>The flight dis­ap­peared from radar screens min­utes after the plane took off and reached an al­ti­tude of 10,900 feet.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties said they had tracked the lo­ca­tions of two of the plane’s black boxes yes­ter­day. Po­lice asked fam­i­lies to pro­vide in­for­ma­tion, such as den­tal records and DNA sam­ples, to help iden­tify any bod­ies re­trieved.</p>
    <p>At the po­lice hos­pi­tal, the brother of co-pi­lot Diego Mamahit said he had been asked for a blood sam­ple. “I be­lieve my younger brother sur­vived; these are just for the po­lice pro­ce­dure,” Mr Chris Mamahit said. “Diego is a good man; we still be­lieve Diego sur­vived.”</p>
    <p>On his LinkedIn pro­file, Mr Diego Mamahit had writ­ten: “I re­ally love to fly.” He and pi­lot Afwan, who goes by only one name, had nearly two decades of com­mer­cial fly­ing ex­pe­ri­ence be­tween them. Mr Afwan had pre­vi­ously been an air force pi­lot. “We the fam­ily still hope for good news,” a fam­ily mem­ber of Mr Afwan, a de­vout Mus­lim, told De­tik.com.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo of­fered sym­pa­thy yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We are mak­ing our best ef­forts to find and res­cue the vic­tims and we all pray that they can be found,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Panca Widiya Nur­santi, a mid­dle-school teacher in Pon­tianak, had been on her way home after a va­ca­tion in her home town of Te­gal in Cen­tral Java. In Pon­tianak, her hus­band Rafiq Yusuf Al Idrus re­counted the last con­tact he had with her.</p>
    <p>“I was jok­ing by say­ing that when she ar­rived in Pon­tianak we would eat sa­tay to­gether,” he said. “She con­tacted me via What­sApp at 2.05pm with laugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“She was al­ready board­ing the plane and she said the weather con­di­tions were not good. I said pray a lot, please.”</p>
