    <p>EASY DOES IT</p>
    <p>He looks amaz­ing, he’s play­ing amaz­ing, but I want to just give him breath­ing room and not put on too much pres­sure af­ter not play­ing com­pet­i­tive bas­ket­ball for 18 months.</p>
    <p>STEVE NASH, Nets coach, on whether Brook­lyn can be ti­tle con­tenders with Kevin Du­rant in their side.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Kevin Du­rant’s smooth-as-silk Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) re­turn is “kind of scary for the rest of the league”, Steve Kerr, his for­mer coach at the Golden State War­riors, said.</p>
    <p>Kerr, who man­aged Du­rant dur­ing two cham­pi­onship runs with the War­riors in 2017 and 2018, had a court­side seat as the for­ward played his first game on Tues­day since June last year be­cause of a torn Achilles ten­don.</p>
    <p>The All-Star for­ward de­parted for Brook­lyn as a free agent last year. By the time he fi­nally suited up for the Nets in the open­ing game of this sea­son, it had been 561 days since his last com­pet­i­tive out­ing.</p>
    <p>But Du­rant, 32, looked like he had never been away, mesh­ing effortless­ly with fel­low Nets star Kyrie Irv­ing, him­self play­ing his first game since Fe­bru­ary due to shoul­der surgery.</p>
    <p>The War­riors were blown away 125-99, with four-time NBA scor­ing cham­pion Du­rant show­ing flashes of fire. He fin­ished with 22 points in just un­der 25 min­utes, con­nect­ing on seven of 16 shots from the floor and drain­ing all seven of his free throws, while Irv­ing had a game-high 26 points.</p>
    <p>Such was the Nets’ dom­i­nance that their rookie coach Steve Nash, a two-time Most Valu­able Player, could not have wished for an eas­ier in­tro­duc­tion in his first game in the hot seat.</p>
    <p>Du­rant and Irv­ing, along with the rest of their starters, all sat out the fourth quar­ter with the game well in hand, lead­ing Kerr to de­clare his for­mer star as good as new.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t tell one dif­fer­ence between see­ing him 18 months ago to see­ing him (now),” he said.</p>
    <p>On his first meet­ing with the War­riors since leav­ing them, Du­rant in­sisted there was no added in­cen­tive to the clash and he warmly em­braced War­riors star Stephen Curry, who paced his team with 20 points, be­fore the game.</p>
    <p>“No emo­tions at all,” he said. “It’s good to see old friends, old team­mates. But I wouldn’t say there was any emo­tion. I think guys came out here and played ex­tremely hard and com­peted and put on a good show for open­ing night.”</p>
    <p>With Du­rant and Irv­ing on the court, ex­perts and fans be­lieve the Nets, who have never won the cham­pi­onship, are con­tenders for the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers’ crown.</p>
    <p>But Nash does not want to pile the pres­sure of ex­pec­ta­tions on the pair, par­tic­u­larly as Du­rant is com­ing back from one of the worst in­juries a bas­ket­ball player can suf­fer.</p>
    <p>“That’s true and fair,” the for­mer Phoenix Suns star said. “He’s done ev­ery­thing and he is in ab­so­lutely the ul­ti­mate po­si­tion to come back from this in­jury.</p>
    <p>“But we also have to give Kevin time to play NBA games and not get car­ried away.</p>
    <p>“He looks amaz­ing, he’s play­ing amaz­ing, but I want to just give him breath­ing room and not put on too much pres­sure af­ter not play­ing com­pet­i­tive bas­ket­ball for 18 months.”</p>
