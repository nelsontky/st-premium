    <p>Should we re­ally in­voke the law and im­pose harsh penal­ties to change triv­ial an­ti­so­cial be­hav­iour?</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, be­ing a lit­tle messy in eat­ing es­tab­lish­ments is surely not a health haz­ard. It is also nei­ther a street nor an en­vi­ron­men­tal crime and prob­a­bly does not even qual­ify as neigh­bourly nui­sance (Time to pe­nalise those not re­turn­ing trays at food cen­tres, by Mr Ang Tun Loon, Sept 22).</p>
    <p>Hav­ing food am­bas­sadors to ad­vise those who make disin­gen­u­ous ex­cuses not to re­turn trays will prob­a­bly back­fire.</p>
    <p>It will sim­ply rile and ag­i­tate those who do not want to make the ex­tra ef­fort, likely caus­ing them to harden their stance even more.</p>
    <p>This sounds like yet an­other plat­i­tude, but change in be­hav­iour gen­er­ally can come only from schools, where good val­ues can be in­stilled partly through dis­ci­plinary ac­tion, with peer pres­sure do­ing the rest.</p>
    <p>My busi­ness­man fa­ther was very re­sis­tant to the idea of do­ing some­thing as me­nial as re­turn­ing used crock­ery and cut­lery. He would of­ten de­ride me for do­ing so, as he saw it as un­be­fit­ting for the better off or the pro­fes­sional.</p>
    <p>He changed his at­ti­tude to­wards this is­sue some­what af­ter I re­minded him that he had not been spar­ing of money and time in ed­u­cat­ing his son and that if ed­u­ca­tion had not made me a better per­son, it would mean his ef­forts had been wasted.</p>
    <p>Gen­tle and in­sis­tent per­sua­sion may be more ap­pro­pri­ate than iron-fisted law.</p>
    <p>It can start at home and then be ex­tended to the wider com­mu­nity. Yik Keng Yeong (Dr)</p>
