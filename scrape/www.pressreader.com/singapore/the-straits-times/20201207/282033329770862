    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter and CDAC chair­man Ong Ye Kung noted that while re­cov­ery from the out­break is un­der way, chal­lenges are likely to per­sist next year. “Many fam­i­lies will still need help, and so we are stretch­ing our bud­get,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese De­vel­op­ment As­sis­tance Coun­cil (CDAC) is set­ting aside a record $36 mil­lion for pro­grammes and schemes that will help needy stu­dents and their fam­i­lies next year as more seek help amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>These will in­clude new ini­tia­tives, such as a coach­ing pro­gramme for stu­dents, and cash grants of up to $800 to sup­port their learn­ing needs, the CDAC said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The bud­geted amount, which is about 20 per cent higher than this year’s es­ti­mated spend­ing, will cater to an ex­pected in­crease in de­mand for sup­port pro­grammes as well as pro­vide more help to stu­dents who are weaker aca­dem­i­cally, it said.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter and CDAC chair­man Ong Ye Kung noted that while re­cov­ery from the out­break is un­der way, chal­lenges are likely to per­sist next year.</p>
    <p>“Many fam­i­lies will still need help, and so we are stretch­ing our bud­get,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong was speak­ing to re­porters on the side­lines of the CDAC’s an­nual Ready for School event, which pro­vides low-in­come fam­i­lies and their school-go­ing chil­dren help in pre­par­ing for the up­com­ing school year.</p>
    <p>This year, 8,700 ben­e­fi­ciary fam­i­lies, in­clud­ing 17,400 chil­dren, will be given fam­ily and school-ready packs con­tain­ing vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>Each fam­ily pack con­tains $260 worth of trans­port and FairPrice vouch­ers, while the school-ready pack holds $80 worth of vouch­ers for school sup­plies.</p>
    <p>The CDAC said packs will be given to 2,200 more fam­i­lies than last year as more house­holds have ap­proached it for help amid the out­break. Each fam­ily will also re­ceive an ex­tra $100 in vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>About $3.9 mil­lion worth of vouch­ers will be given out this year, $1 mil­lion more than at last year’s Ready for School event, Mr Ong said on the sec­ond last day of dis­tri­bu­tion at Nanyang Ju­nior Col­lege.</p>
    <p>This year’s event is spread out across three lo­ca­tions over four days to pre­vent crowd­ing, with only one rep­re­sen­ta­tive per fam­ily al­lowed to col­lect the packs. Games, work­shops and other ac­tiv­i­ties were also held on­line.</p>
    <p>While safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have ne­ces­si­tated smaller group sizes for tu­ition classes or­gan­ised by the CDAC, more on­line ses­sions will be of­fered in the com­ing year, the coun­cil said.</p>
    <p>About 100 tu­ition stu­dents will also be se­lected next year to re­ceive per­sonal guid­ance through a new coach­ing pro­gramme for those in greater need.</p>
    <p>It will en­tail cus­tomised learn­ing plans, cash grants for learn­ing ex­penses and sup­port groups for par­ents, among other things.</p>
    <p>Ware­house as­sis­tant Jef­frey Lim, 39, who was at Nanyang Ju­nior Col­lege to col­lect a fam­ily pack and school packs for his three sons yes­ter­day, said the vouch­ers will come in es­pe­cially help­ful this year.</p>
    <p>His wife, who earns an hourly wage as a part-time packer, has had less work this year be­cause of the out­break, said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>Aside from fi­nan­cial re­lief, the CDAC also pro­vides the two older boys – aged 12 and 10 – help with their school­work through weekly men­tor­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>“This also helps us to know how they are coping with their as­sign­ments,” Mr Lim said.</p>
