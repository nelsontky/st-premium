    <p>The process of vac­ci­nat­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans against Covid-19 will take some time as it is chal­leng­ing and must be car­ried out safely and care­fully, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a visit to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) yes­ter­day, Mr Gan said he had met the cen­tre’s man­age­ment team to get a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the chal­lenges they face and how the vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise can be car­ried out smoothly.</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers at NCID were among the first Sin­ga­pore­ans to re­ceive the Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>This came just over a week after the first batch of the vac­cines ar­rived here from Brus­sels, Bel­gium, on Mon­day last week.</p>
    <p>Asked why it took a week be­fore the first jabs were ad­min­is­tered, Mr Gan said the process of pre­par­ing the vac­cine and en­sur­ing the right peo­ple re­ceive it has been chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>He noted that the vac­cine must be ad­min­is­tered within a short time once it is re­moved from lowtem­per­a­ture stor­age.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine can be stored at mi­nus 70 deg C for up to six months or at 2 to 8 deg C – the tem­per­a­ture of a com­mon re­frig­er­a­tor – for about</p>
    <p>five days.</p>
    <p>“All the pro­cesses have to be smoothened and also we need to make sure that there’s no mis­takes,” stressed the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, the per­son who is re­ceiv­ing the vac­ci­na­tion, the iden­tity has to be ver­i­fied, whether he has a pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tion, whether he has al­lergy. All this has</p>
    <p>to be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, 40 NCID staff mem­bers, in­clud­ing clin­i­cal, nurs­ing, al­lied health, an­cil­lary and ad­min­is­tra­tion staff, were vac­ci­nated. They will be given a sec­ond dose on Jan 20 and the re­main­ing NCID staff will get their jabs pro­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Health­care Group man­age­ment and staff will be vac­ci­nated from next month.</p>
    <p>Other health­care work­ers on the front line are also be­ing ros­tered for vac­ci­na­tion, with public health­care in­sti­tu­tions and pri­vate hos­pi­tals ar­rang­ing for their staff to be vac­ci­nated at their re­spec­tive premises.</p>
    <p>For the gen­eral public, Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents aged 70 and older will re­ceive their jabs from Fe­bru­ary, fol­lowed by other Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents who are med­i­cally el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan noted that dur­ing the ad­min­is­tra­tion of the first rounds of the vac­cine at NCID yes­ter­day, the health­care work­ers in­volved were very cau­tious and would “check and dou­ble-check to make sure that they fol­low the pro­ce­dures care­fully.”</p>
    <p>He added that it is bet­ter to do it care­fully in­stead of rush­ing to roll out the vac­cine en masse, only to dis­cover un­fore­seen dif­fi­cul­ties and chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“We ad­vise the team to do it care­fully, do it slowly. Make sure you smoothen the process and are familiar with the process be­fore you roll out in a big vol­ume. I think do­ing it this way is safer,” said Mr Gan.</p>
