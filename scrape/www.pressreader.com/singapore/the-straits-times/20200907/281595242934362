    <p>The num­ber of dengue cases has been ta­per­ing down­wards since early last month. But there are still 326 ac­tive clus­ters, of which 26 are big clus­ters. The more peo­ple in­fected, the higher the chance of spread to oth­ers around them, and asymp­to­matic dengue cases could still be spread­ing dengue to oth­ers and adding to the clus­ter.</p>
    <p>Dengue cases, while still at an all-time high, have been ta­per­ing down­wards since early last month – and may drop be­low 1,000 cases a week for the first time in 13 weeks.</p>
    <p>But the dengue peak sea­son will not be over for at least an­other month, so peo­ple in hot spots need to be vig­i­lant in or­der to break the chain of trans­mis­sion and bring down num­bers. To recap what has proven to be the worst dengue epi­demic in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory:</p>
    <p>The more than 28,000 cases so far have al­ready sur­passed all pre­vi­ous an­nual fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Not only did the num­ber of in­fec­tions this year ex­ceed 1,000 cases a week – cross­ing the mark for the first time in the week of June 7 to 13 – but it also stayed above that for an­other 11 weeks, peak­ing at 1,793 in July. The largest num­ber of weekly in­fec­tions pre­vi­ously was 891 cases in 2014.</p>
    <p>It has thrown up five dengue su­per clus­ters with 300 or more peo­ple in­fected. The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said this has hap­pened only once be­fore be­tween 2013 and last year. That clus­ter in Choa Chu Kang, with a to­tal of 534 peo­ple in­fected, lasted two months – from June 25 to Aug 25, in 2014. • Of the 21 peo­ple – aged 25 to 92 – who have died of dengue this year, 18 worked or resided in ac­tive dengue clus­ters.</p>
    <p>It is worth ex­am­in­ing the role clus­ters play in the spread of dengue.</p>
    <p>A clus­ter is formed when the on­set of two or more cases oc­cur within 14 days (the max­i­mum in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod) and within 150m (the max­i­mum dis­tance the Aedes mos­quito usu­ally flies) of each other, in­di­cat­ing ac­tive trans­mis­sion within that area.</p>
    <p>This is why there are some­times ad­join­ing clus­ters in­stead of one big clus­ter, even though they may share a com­mon road. The timing of the in­fec­tions shows they are ac­tu­ally dif­fer­ent clus­ters.</p>
    <p>The big­gest clus­ter to­day – in the Alju­nied-Gey­lang-Sims Av­enue area – with 375 peo­ple in­fected, started in Fe­bru­ary. It had 12 new cases in the past fort­night.</p>
    <p>The NEA said of the mos­quito breed­ing found in that clus­ter, 54 per cent were found in homes, with two premises hav­ing mul­ti­ple lar­vae breed­ing spots.</p>
    <p>Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil which over­sees this area, said it “takes the dengue threat se­ri­ously and recog­nises that this is a mat­ter of na­tional con­cern”.</p>
    <p>It has been work­ing with NEA as well as its own pest con­trol and con­ser­vancy con­trac­tors to step up in­spec­tion and fog­ging ex­er­cises in the area, its spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides work­ing closely with NEA on var­i­ous fog­ging ex­er­cises in the com­mon ar­eas, the town coun­cil also car­ries out mist­ing and resid­ual spray of in­sec­ti­cides to the com­mon cor­ri­dors, stair­case land­ings and ground floor ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>The other four su­per big clus­ters with more than 300 in­fec­tions, started in May and June. In these su­per clus­ters, homes ac­counted for an alarm­ing 45 per cent to 79 per cent of mos­quito breed­ing.</p>
    <p>Tan­jong Pa­gar Town Coun­cil, which over­sees the area of the sec­ond-big­gest clus­ter with 343 peo­ple in­fected, said it has been work­ing with the NEA on var­i­ous mea­sures, in­clud­ing clean­ing and oil­ing drains, cut­ting grass, spray­ing aerosol, fog­ging and inspection­s.</p>
    <p>The Aedes mos­quito is an “ur­ban” mos­quito that thrives in homes and built-up ar­eas. It needs only a small amount of wa­ter to breed, and lar­vae can sur­vive in the rims of pails, or dis­carded drink cans.</p>
    <p>The NEA told The Straits Times that the per­sis­tence of large dengue clus­ters is due to “the high num­ber of dengue cases which form a host reser­voir that passes on the dengue virus when the mos­quito bites them and then bites an un­in­fected per­son”. That is, the more peo­ple in­fected, the higher the chance of spread to oth­ers around them.</p>
    <p>This is why it is im­por­tant for peo­ple with dengue to pre­vent them­selves from be­ing bit­ten again while they re­main in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Dengue is spread by the fe­male Aedes mos­quito, which picks up the virus when it bites some­one who has the dis­ease and can spread it to other hu­mans it sub­se­quently bites.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert with the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said the virus has an in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod of three to 14 days, af­ter which the per­son is in­fec­tious and can pass the virus on to mos­qui­toes in the next three to seven days.</p>
    <p>This is re­gard­less of whether the per­son gets sick. Prof Hsu said four in five peo­ple in­fected are asymp­to­matic, but also in­fec­tious. So some­one who has been bit­ten but has no fever or other symp­toms could still be spread­ing dengue to oth­ers and adding to the clus­ter.</p>
    <p>“We have seen that in big clus­ters, the in­ci­dence of mos­quito breed­ing is high and clus­ters only start to close when the num­ber of breed­ing (spots) we de­tect drop,” an NEA spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Thus, a key strat­egy is to de­tect and de­stroy mos­quito breed­ing.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age this, the NEA raised the penalty for re­peated mos­quito breed­ing from July 15.</p>
    <p>From a flat fine of $200 for house­holds found breed­ing mos­qui­toes, the fine has gone up to $300 for a sec­ond of­fence, or if the place has more than one breed­ing spot; and $400 if it is more se­ri­ous. Sub­se­quent of­fences can see of­fend­ers hauled to court, where they may face a fine of up to</p>
    <p>$5,000, three months’ jail, or both.</p>
    <p>The agency warned: “We are still in the peak dengue sea­son, and weekly cases can con­tinue to re­main high be­yond Oc­to­ber if mos­quito preven­tion mea­sures are not sus­tained by all stake­hold­ers.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides check­ing for breed­ing, it also ad­vised peo­ple liv­ing in dengue clus­ters to spray in­sec­ti­cide in dark cor­ners of their homes, ap­ply in­sect re­pel­lent reg­u­larly and wear long-sleeved tops and long pants.</p>
    <p>The NEA said that about 85 per cent of the 2,392 dengue clus­ters re­ported this year closed by Sept 1. But there are still 326 ac­tive clus­ters, of which 26 are big clus­ters with more than 100 peo­ple in­fected.</p>

Even some&#xAD;one who has been bit&#xAD;ten but has no symp&#xAD;toms can still spread dengue and add to a clus&#xAD;ter.</p>
