    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) has set up re­struc­tur­ing teams to as­sess bor­row­ers who have taken a debt hol­i­day amid the grad­ual un­wind­ing of gov­ern­ment re­lief mea­sures to­wards the end of the year.</p>
    <p>But given the enor­mous gov­ern­ment sup­port around the world, as­set prices are un­likely to col­lapse, with the bank guid­ing that it does not ex­pect a fallout that was seen dur­ing the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>UOB posted a 40 per cent drop in sec­ond-quar­ter net profit to $703 mil­lion for the three months ended June 30, hurt by weaker in­come and a surge in pro­vi­sions set aside for the eas­ing of loan mora­to­ria, chief ex­ec­u­tive Wee Ee Cheong said at a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The $703 mil­lion fig­ure com­pares with $1.17 bil­lion in the same pe­riod a year ago. This was weaker than the con­sen­sus fore­cast of $815 mil­lion by four an­a­lysts in a Bloomberg poll.</p>
    <p>Pro­vi­sions against bad loans surged to $396 mil­lion, against just $51 mil­lion a year ago, with credit costs ris­ing to 67 ba­sis points. To­tal gen­eral pro­vi­sions as of June 30 stood at $2.39 bil­lion, 20 per cent up from $1.99 bil­lion a quar­ter ago. The bank has guided for to­tal pro­vi­sions to re­main be­tween $2 bil­lion and $3 bil­lion for “the next few quar­ters”.</p>
    <p>UOB’s group chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Lee Wai Fai said: “Var­i­ous re­lief pro­grammes and laws put in place might re­sult in low non-per­form­ing loans and low delin­quency dur­ing this pe­riod. While we re­main com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing cus­tomers through dif­fi­cult times, we are also ex­pect­ing credit costs to rise when most mora­to­ria end.”</p>
    <p>Roughly 16 per cent of UOB’s loan book is un­der mora­to­rium pro­grammes. About 10 per cent of loans in Sin­ga­pore are un­der mora­to­rium; in Malaysia it is 63 per cent, and in Thai­land it is over 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>UOB has pro­jected for about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of loans un­der mora­to­ria to sour into bad debt in a worst-case sce­nario. For the re­main­ing loans, the ma­jor­ity will prob­a­bly need some com­mer­cial­base re­struc­tur­ing, said group chief risk of­fi­cer Chan Kok Seong.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee added that credit losses are ex­pected to be spread out over two fi­nan­cial years, not­ing that credit ac­com­mo­da­tion across the re­gion, and glob­ally, has made a lot of dif­fer­ence for many busi­nesses with liq­uid­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>“As­set prices are un­likely to col­lapse be­cause of gov­ern­ment sup­port around the world. We don’t ex­pect the sit­u­a­tion to play out like the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>UOB’s non-per­form­ing loan (NPL) ra­tio in the sec­ond quar­ter was 1.6 per cent, up from 1.5 per cent a year ago, and un­changed from a quar­ter ago. The bank has fac­tored in a peak NPL ra­tio of 3 per cent to 3.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee noted that while UOB is one the largest users of En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s risk-shar­ing loan fa­cil­ity, which the bank taps to sup­port its small and medium-sized en­ter­prise (SME) cus­tomers, only 50 per cent of the loans ac­cepted by SME cus­tomers had been drawn down. This sig­nals that their liq­uid­ity con­cerns are man­age­able, he said.</p>
    <p>The board de­clared an in­terim div­i­dend of 39 cents per share, down from the year-ago quar­ter of 55 cents per share.</p>
    <p>To­tal in­come fell 12 per cent to $2.26 bil­lion. Net in­ter­est mar­gin for the quar­ter was 1.48 per cent, a sharp fall from the 1.81 per cent earned on loans a year ago. The one-month Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate as of Wed­nes­day was at a record low of 0.25 per cent.</p>
    <p>UOB shares closed up 34 cents, or 1.8 per cent, to $19.76 yes­ter­day.</p>
