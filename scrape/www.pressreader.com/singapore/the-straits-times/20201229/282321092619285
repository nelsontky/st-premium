    <p>FAR CRY FROM GLORY DAYS</p>
    <p>Lionel Messi has yet to make up his mind if he will ter­mi­nate his two-decade long re­la­tion­ship with Barcelona at the end of this sea­son, hint­ing that he could see out his play­ing days in Ma­jor League Soc­cer.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian’s fu­ture has been a hot topic ever since his aborted at­tempt to leave in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>He had to put those plans on hold till after this sea­son as the club in­sisted on en­forc­ing a €700 mil­lion (S$1.14 bil­lion) exit clause.</p>
    <p>But with the Cata­lans lan­guish­ing in fifth place in La Liga, eight points be­hind lead­ers Atletico Madrid, Messi has la­belled the club’s plight as “re­ally bad”.</p>
    <p>From next week, the Barca cap­tain will be free to ne­go­ti­ate his next move as he en­ters the fi­nal six months of his con­tract, with Manch­ester City and Paris Saint-Ger­main known pur­suers.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what I’m go­ing to do yet, I’m go­ing to wait un­til the sea­son ends,” Messi said in an in­ter­view with Span­ish tele­vi­sion chan­nel La Sexta on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“I’d love to ex­pe­ri­ence liv­ing in the United States, play­ing in that league and liv­ing that life but I don’t know whether it’ll hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“Right now the most im­por­tant thing is to fo­cus on the team and fin­ish the sea­son well, to fo­cus on try­ing to win tro­phies and not get dis­tracted by other things.”</p>
    <p>The Ar­gentina skip­per did not hide his pes­simism about his club, who have made their worst start to a sea­son in 33 years and are in a fi­nan­cial crisis be­cause of the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dif­fi­cult moment for the club, for ev­ery­one, but those in­side the club know that it’s in a re­ally bad sit­u­a­tion, things are very bad and it’s go­ing to be dif­fi­cult to return the club to where it used to be,” he added.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Barca’s 3-0 La Liga vic­tory over Val­ladolid last Tues­day, coach Ronald Koe­man al­lowed Messi to return to his home town of Rosario in Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>While the club con­firmed he will miss to­day’s home game against Eibar as he “com­pletes the treat­ment for his right an­kle”, Span­ish daily AS said Messi has been given an ex­tended Christ­mas break to spend more time with his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Messi is, how­ever, ex­pected to return to Barca in time for their next La Liga meet­ing at bot­tom side Huesca on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It’s a dif­fi­cult moment for the club, for ev­ery­one, but those in­side the club know that... things are very bad and it’s go­ing to be dif­fi­cult to return the club to where it used to be.</p>
