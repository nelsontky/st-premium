    <p>French lux­ury house Cartier’s lat­est cam­paign, shot by New York fash­ion pho­tog­ra­pher Craig McDean, brings to­gether five di­verse change­mak­ers blaz­ing new trails in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Ap­pointed to launch the new gen­er­a­tion of the Pasha de Cartier watch which made its de­but in 1985, the quin­tet are Rami Malek, Maisie Wil­liams, Troye Si­van, Wil­low Smith and Jackson Wang.</p>
    <p>Malek, 39, nabbed a Best Ac­tor Os­car last year for play­ing the late Fred­die Mer­cury in the 2018 Queen biopic Bohemian Rhap­sody, while Wil­liams, 33, be­came hugely fa­mous be­cause of her role in the tele­vi­sion block­buster Game Of Thrones (2011 to 2019).</p>
    <p>The other three are young but heavy hit­ters on the mu­sic scene. De­scribed as “the per­fect pop star” by Time mag­a­zine, Aus­tralian Si­van, 25, has chalked up more than eight bil­lion streams and 1.3 mil­lion sales of his first two al­bums, Blue Neigh­bour­hood (2015) and Bloom (2018).</p>
    <p>Smith – whose par­ents are Hol­ly­wood ac­tors Will Smith and Jada Pin­kett – is a 19-year-old mul­ti­hy­phen­ate: singer, song­writer, rap­per, record pro­ducer, ac­tress and dancer. Ditto Wang, 26, a Chi­nese rap­per, singer and dancer based in South Korea.</p>
    <p>Like the Tank and the Santos, the Pasha de Cartier is one of the French mai­son’s most iconic and dis­tinc­tive watches.</p>
    <p>It was de­signed by Ger­ald Genta, whose leg­endary works in­clude the Aude­mars Piguet Royal Oak and the Patek Philippe Nau­tilus.</p>
    <p>The watch’s con­cept re­volved around a “square within a cir­cle”, with the cir­cu­lar case hous­ing a</p>
    <p>square railway min­utes track on the dial and just four Ara­bic nu­meral indices serv­ing as a vis­ual an­chor.</p>
    <p>Over the years, the time­piece has gone through sev­eral in­car­na­tions. The new-gen­er­a­tion re­tains al­most all of the quirky fea­tures of the orig­i­nal, but with some up­dates in­clud­ing the Cartier-de­vel­oped Quick­Switch sys­tem for the easy chang­ing of straps.</p>
    <p>Cartier’s in­ter­na­tional mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor Ar­naud Car­rez said: “Since its cre­ation in the 1980s, the Pasha watch has em­bod­ied a cer­tain idea of suc­cess di­rectly linked to its ex­tro­verted de­sign, power and graphic non-con­formism.”</p>
    <p>The new Pasha am­bas­sadors, he added, were cho­sen be­cause of “their dif­fer­ences, cre­ativ­ity, con­nec­tion and multi-dis­ci­plinary tal­ents”.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times man­aged to con­tact four of them via e-mail to talk about the pan­demic, their pas­sions and be­ing part of the Pasha de Cartier tribe.</p>
    <p>In more ways than one, Covid-19 has thrown the world into a tizzy. What is the most im­por­tant thing you have learnt about your­self, and about life, dur­ing this pe­riod?</p>
    <p>Malek:</p>
    <p>I am al­ways learn­ing, but fun­da­men­tally, I try to do this through my work. I think art is an in­cred­i­bly powerful tool of rep­re­sen­ta­tion. So, I hope to keep cre­at­ing that through the roles I play and the projects I am a part of bring­ing to fruition.</p>
    <p>Si­van: 2020 has been a ride. I’m in Aus­tralia and haven’t trav­elled for a few months. I feel lucky that I had some mu­sic al­ready writ­ten, but I have found it quite hard to write new mu­sic this year.</p>
    <p>I think hav­ing a com­mu­nity is so im­por­tant – it’s feel­ing safe and looked af­ter by the peo­ple around you. I’ve grown up my en­tire life in very tight-knit com­mu­ni­ties and am so thank­ful for that.</p>
    <p>Also, I’ve re­ally en­joyed cook­ing over the last few months. It’s be­come a rit­ual of sorts and pushed me to de­velop some new skills I prob­a­bly wouldn’t have other­wise. Wang: To my team, I am a (piece of) work by them. To me, I am my own sub­ject. I need to un­der­stand my­self so I can solve prob­lems. It is very im­por­tant to know your­self. Only when you know what kind of per­son you are, can you do bet­ter and go fur­ther.</p>
    <p>I hope ev­ery­one can clearly un­der­stand who they are and then do their best. There may be 100 dif­fi­cul­ties, but there are al­ways 100 ways.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams: Un­til this point, I’ve never re­ally had a di­rec­tion as I’ve al­lowed my­self to be pulled through this in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>As a per­son, I would say I’m a con­trol freak so, from here on, I see my­self hav­ing a clear plan and goal.</p>
    <p>How do you hope the world will change af­ter this cri­sis?</p>
    <p>Malek:</p>
    <p>I hope we con­tinue to ed­u­cate our­selves the best we can, to un­der­stand all sides of ev­ery con­ver­sa­tion and lead with kind­ness.</p>
    <p>Also, please vote. No mat­ter what group you iden­tify with, hu­man ci­vil­ity should be at the centre of your con­scious­ness.</p>
    <p>Si­van: Be mind­ful of oth­ers on­line. Don’t un­der­es­ti­mate your power. Do what feels right, trust your in­stincts, take risks and en­joy your­self. Take a day or two be­fore re­spond­ing to hate on­line.</p>
    <p>Wang: I hope more peo­ple will act on their dreams and make their own paths. Go for it. Like you, I am also mak­ing my own way to the fu­ture. Wil­liams: Any­one has the power to change the world, es­pe­cially those with in­flu­ence. I be­lieve we were put on Earth to do more than just ex­ist.</p>
    <p>I want to leave the planet in a bet­ter state than the way I found it be­cause I think that is my pur­pose. I don’t want to only be a mother for my chil­dren, but I will also be a mother for the world.</p>
    <p>What is the most mem­o­rable or sat­is­fy­ing thing you have done dur­ing this pe­riod?</p>
    <p>Malek:</p>
    <p>My goals and what I strive for con­stantly change, adapt and up­date. I find that ex­cit­ing.</p>
    <p>Si­van: Shar­ing Take Your­self Home. That song, for me, was about re­ally ask­ing my­self some tough questions about who I am, what I want and where I want to be.</p>
    <p>It was an in­tro­spec­tive mo­ment that I felt be­came more rel­e­vant with ev­ery­thing go­ing on in the world and I wanted to share in the hope that it would res­onate.</p>
    <p>Wang: I will be re­leas­ing a new song this month and a Chi­nese EP af­ter that. Hope you en­joy them. Wil­liams: I see art and cre­ativ­ity as fluid, so I’m in­ter­ested in push­ing the bound­aries of what film and tele­vi­sion can be.</p>
    <p>What does time mean to you? And how does it feel to be a mem­ber of the Pasha de Cartier tribe? Malek:</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cance. I l ove that Cartier has a way of hon­our­ing what is trea­sured of the past, and mar­ry­ing that with a mod­ern ac­ces­si­bil­ity and twist. Pasha has both del­i­cacy and strength.</p>
    <p>Si­van: Time is some­thing to lean into, I think. Change can be scary, but I try my best to be present and ex­cited for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>There’s a time­less­ness to the Pasha de­sign that I’d love to strive for in my work. It’s clas­sic, but mod­ern, fresh and stands for some­thing.</p>
    <p>Wang: No mat­ter if it’s right or wrong, there is noth­ing which is done in vain. Ev­ery step de­serves to be re­mem­bered.</p>
    <p>Pasha is full of en­ergy and imag­i­na­tion just like me – bold, di­rect, full of per­son­al­ity and bound­ary-push­ing. Wil­liams: I used to feel like I was run­ning out of time, but that was be­cause I used to fill my time with point­less things. Now, I see time is pre­cious and I don’t want to waste it.</p>
    <p>I find the Pasha watch em­pow­er­ing to wear as it re­flects my con­fi­dence as a woman.</p>
    <p>What’s the most sig­nif­i­cant time of your life?</p>
    <p>Malek:</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, I’m just proud that I get to work in this in­dus­try. How for­tu­nate I am to be do­ing some­thing that I love so much and play­ing such an eclec­tic col­lec­tion of char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Each role has been as much about self-dis­cov­ery as it is an op­por­tu­nity to ex­plore hu­man na­ture, hu­man be­hav­iour, psy­chol­ogy, an ex­pe­ri­ence dif­fer­ent to your own.</p>
    <p>Also, how im­por­tant it is to keep ap­ply­ing hard work, ded­i­ca­tion, fo­cus and pa­tience.</p>
    <p>Si­van: Be­ing on stage is a fan­tasy to me – it’s been my dream for as long as I can re­mem­ber and it’s never lost on me when I’m on stage – how lucky I am to be able to bring that fan­tasy to life.</p>
    <p>I’m most proud when I’m at my shows and I see the faces in the crowd. I think the au­di­ence are role models to me – I see the most inspiring faces, strength and sick­en­ing looks.</p>
    <p>I’m equally proud when some­one men­tions that a song/al­bum of mine has been the sound­track to a par­tic­u­lar sea­son in their life. I love it when that hap­pens to me with mu­sic, so I’m al­ways re­ally hon­oured when it hap­pens to some­one else with mine.</p>
    <p>Wang: The mo­ment hasn’t come yet. When it comes, it should have some­thing to do with my mu­sic rankings on Bill­board.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams: To be recog­nised for my role on Game Of Thrones is some­thing I’m re­ally proud of.</p>
