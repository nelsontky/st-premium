    <p>The word re­trench­ment car­ries with it a neg­a­tive con­no­ta­tion (Un­em­ploy­ment at high­est in a decade, re­trench­ments up, July 30).</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that re­trench are per­ceived to be ir­re­spon­si­ble cor­po­rate cit­i­zens, and work­ers who are re­trenched are deemed “un­der­per­form­ers” by the job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In the con­text of the cur­rent global cri­sis, most com­pa­nies have to cut their head­count due to fi­nan­cial con­sid­er­a­tions. Pay­roll costs rank among the high­est costs in most busi­nesses. Cut­ting head­count will re­sult in “sav­ings” the very next month. It is a prac­ti­cal so­lu­tion to the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing that the com­pany has taken all other pos­si­ble mea­sures such as fur­lough­ing or pay cuts, there are re­ally not many other op­tions left.</p>
    <p>In such cases, busi­nesses need to do what is re­quired not just to save the busi­ness, but also to save the jobs of the other work­ers not re­trenched. We should not view th­ese em­ploy­ers neg­a­tively.</p>
    <p>For work­ers who re­ceive the pink slip, the job mar­ket should not brand them as tainted goods. In the course of my work sup­port­ing re­trenched work­ers dur­ing their ca­reer tran­si­tion, I have found that many of them are good work­ers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. This is val­i­dated by their em­ploy­ers who en­trust them to us for sup­port in their job search.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ments will con­tinue in the fore­see­able fu­ture due to the pan­demic. It is im­per­a­tive that com­pa­nies con­tinue to do what is within their ca­pa­bil­i­ties be­fore re­sort­ing to re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>When the in­evitable has to hap­pen, those af­fected must be given all pos­si­ble prac­ti­cal and emo­tional sup­port.</p>
    <p>Emo­tional sup­port must con­tinue to be pro­vided for a rea­son­able pe­riod of time af­ter ser­vice sep­a­ra­tion. This is how com­pa­nies can la­bel them­selves as em­ploy­ers of choice when it’s time to hire again.</p>
