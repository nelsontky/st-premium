    <p>MI­AMI • Damian Lil­lard had a mis­sion he wanted to com­plete at the ESPN Wide World of Sports as the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son re­sumed late last month – to make the play-offs.</p>
    <p>“Ain’t noth­ing I want more,” the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers point guard told ESPN. “When I came here (to Dis­ney World) I told them I’m not here to waste my time. Our work ain’t done yet.”</p>
    <p>He ex­ploded for 61 points on Tues­day as the Trail Blaz­ers roared to­wards a place in the NBA play­offs with a thrilling 134-131 win over the Dal­las Mav­er­icks.</p>
    <p>Lil­lard – who had scored 51 points in a vic­tory against the Philadel­phia 76ers last Sun­day – once again led from the front for Port­land, who are now within touch­ing dis­tance of a post-sea­son berth.</p>
    <p>A win against the Brook­lyn Nets to­day lands Port­land in the play-in game this week­end.</p>
    <p>The best-of-two se­ries be­tween the eighth- and ninth-place fin­ish­ers in the con­fer­ence is for when it is no longer pos­si­ble for more than a four-game dif­fer­ence in the standings be­tween the two teams.</p>
    <p>As it stands, Port­land (34-39) are eighth in the West­ern Con­fer­ence, while the Mem­phis Griz­zlies (33-39) are ninth. The eighth seed will need to win one game in the se­ries to ad­vance to the play-offs.</p>
    <p>“We have to come out with the same men­tal­ity,” Lil­lard said of the game against the Nets to­day. “We con­trol our own des­tiny. That’s the most im­por­tant game of our lives.”</p>
    <p>His 61-point ef­fort made him only the sec­ond player in NBA his­tory to score 60 points or more in three games dur­ing a sin­gle sea­son, putting him along­side the l egendary Wilt Cham­ber­lain.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy to be in that kind of com­pany, and I’m happy that two of those three (60-point games) came in a win­ning ef­fort,” Lil­lard added.</p>
    <p>“It’s an hon­our to be in com­pany with Wilt. Hope­fully it’ll con­tinue.”</p>
    <p>Port­land coach Terry Stotts said his guard has been ex­tra fo­cused since he missed two l ate free throws in a loss to the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“He’s show­ing a lot of re­solve,” Stotts said. “No­body wanted to come into this bub­ble and make the play-offs more than Dame. His lead­er­ship and his game speaks for it­self. He’s bring­ing the team along with him.”</p>
    <p>The Blaz­ers talisman nailed a clutch three-pointer in the clos­ing stages to level the score at 130-130 and then pro­vided the as­sist that saw Port­land take a 132-130 lead with just un­der a minute re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>His lat­est mas­ter­class was com­ple­mented with 26 points from vet­eran Carmelo An­thony, while Zach Collins and Gary Trent Jr had 11 points each.</p>
    <p>For the Mav­er­icks (43-31), Kristaps Porzingis led the scor­ing with 36 points, while Luka Don­cic added 25 with 10 as­sists and eight re­bounds. Tim Har­d­away Jr scored 24 points with four re­bounds.</p>
    <p>Tues­day’s com­bi­na­tion of re­sults else­where left ev­ery­thing to play for head­ing into the fi­nal round of seed­ing games to­day, with Port­land, Mem­phis, the Phoenix Suns (33-39) and the San An­to­nio Spurs (32-38) still math­e­mat­i­cally in with a chance of claim­ing eighth or ninth place.</p>
    <p>Phoenix’s un­beaten streak in­side the Or­lando “bub­ble” stretched to seven games af­ter a 130-117 win over a se­verely de­pleted Six­ers side. The win, com­bined with San An­to­nio’s 123-105 vic­tory over Hous­ton and Mem­phis’s 122-107 de­feat by the Bos­ton Celtics, leaves the race for the eighth and ninth places on a knife edge.</p>
    <p>The Griz­zlies, who have lost six of their seven games since the league restarted, face the Eastern Con­fer­ence top seeds Mil­wau­kee in their fi­nal game to­day.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo was ejected in the sec­ond quar­ter for head-butting Moritz Wag­ner in the Bucks’ 126-113 vic­tory over the Wash­ing­ton Wiz­ards. He could face a one-game sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>Phoenix take on the Mav­er­icks to­day. An eighth win against Dal­las, and a Griz­zlies loss to the Bucks, would put the Suns into the play-in round.</p>
