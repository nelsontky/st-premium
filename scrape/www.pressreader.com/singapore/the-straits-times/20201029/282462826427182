    <p>MEX­ICO CITY • She has been a princess, a pres­i­dent, a Marine Corps sergeant, an as­tro­naut and a Star Wars stormtroop­er. In Mex­ico for the Day of the Dead fes­ti­val, Bar­bie is even a skele­ton.</p>
    <p>Yet while fans of the iconic doll see it as an homage to the coun­try’s rich tra­di­tion, crit­ics say it is lit­tle more than cul­tural ap­pro­pri­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mattel has launched the sec­ond Bar­bie based on Ca­t­rina, a skele­tal rep­re­sen­ta­tion of death cre­ated by car­toon­ist Jose Guadalupe Posada that is a sym­bol of one of Mex­ico’s most im­por­tant fes­ti­vals.</p>
    <p>The United States toy­maker says the doll “hon­ours the tra­di­tions, sym­bols and rit­u­als” of the Day of the Dead, which is cel­e­brated on Nov 1 and 2.</p>
    <p>But some in Mex­ico see the Bar­bie – which has a price tag of about US$72 (S$98) – as j ust another ex­am­ple of big brands cash­ing in on the coun­try’s her­itage.</p>
    <p>“The cul­tural, hered­i­tary and sym­bolic im­por­tance that this hol­i­day has for Mex­ico opens up in the eyes of the mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties that are ex­ploited by these firms,” said so­ci­ol­o­gist Roberto Al­varez.</p>
    <p>The Day of the Dead “should be a solemn sub­ject”, but it has be­come a com­mer­cial event in the US since be­ing fea­tured in movies such as Coco, the com­puter-an­i­mated fan­tasy re­leased by Dis­ney’s Pixar stu­dio in 2017, he said.</p>
    <p>Fans of the iconic doll see Ca­t­rina Bar­bie – which bears cer­tain sim­i­lar­i­ties to renowned painter Frida Kahlo – as a re­spect­ful trib­ute.</p>
    <p>“It means that they take no­tice of our tra­di­tions,” said Zoila Mun­tane, a 54-year-old artist and doll col­lec­tor who has 2,000 Bar­bies. Fel­low fan Car­los Sandoval says the doll rep­re­sents “a very beau­ti­ful tra­di­tion, like few oth­ers in the world”.</p>
    <p>This year, Bar­bie wears a blush­coloured lace dress and a crown of skele­ton hands hold­ing roses and marigolds, un­like the first Day of the Dead edi­tion last year, which was dressed in black. Its cre­ator, Mex­i­can-Amer­i­can de­signer Javier Me­abe, said he sought to “cre­ate more aware­ness of the cel­e­bra­tion”, which Un­esco in 2003 named an In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity. The fes­ti­val is be­lieved to be when the gate­way sep­a­rat­ing the liv­ing and the de­ceased opens, al­low­ing peo­ple to pay their re­spects to those who have died.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gist Li­brada Moreno, an aca­demic at the Na­tional Au­ton­o­mous Univer­sity of Mex­ico, sees the Bar­bie as a “cul­tural hy­brid” and prod­uct of mi­gra­tion to the US, home to 37 mil­lion peo­ple of Mex­i­can an­ces­try.</p>
    <p>More than one bil­lion Bar­bies have been sold glob­ally since the Amer­i­can brand’s launch 60 years ago.</p>
    <p>An ear­lier Bar­bie i nspired by Kahlo was not sold i n Mex­ico be­cause her fam­ily con­sid­ered its im­age at odds with that of the late artist. Mattel is not the only US brand launch­ing prod­ucts linked to the Mex­i­can fes­ti­val. There is also a Ca­t­rina Min­nie Mouse and a Nike Day of the Dead col­lec­tion.</p>
