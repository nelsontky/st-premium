    <p>My morn­ings have no hel­los and my evenings are with­out good­byes. I have no fixed de­par­ture time be­cause there is no place to ar­rive. I am home, alone, where there are no greet­ings and no farewells. Not go­ing to the of­fice has be­come the most pe­cu­liar thing I have en­coun­tered. Who knew we’d long for some­one to sim­ply say, “see you to­mor­row”.</p>
    <p>It has been 242 days since I last went to of­fice – bar­ring a soli­tary trip to pick up re­search books – and I feel like a man who has lost his tribe and mis­placed his des­ti­na­tion. It is scarcely a com­plaint, merely a state of be­ing.</p>
    <p>My long-sleeved shirts hang un­used in the cup­board and my shoes plead to be worn. A self-pro­claimed ex­pert on soles told me the un­der­side of shoes come ungummed if you don’t use them. Shorts are our uni­form and shav­ing de­pends on a mother’s cluck of dis­ap­proval dur­ing a video call.</p>
    <p>Liv­ing in si­lence has its value for it re­sem­bles a retreat and yet, at times, on week­days, I feel like the per­son in Min­nie Bruce Pratt’s poem, The Sound Of One Fork.</p>
    <p>“While I wait I can hear the ran­dom clink of one fork</p>
    <p>against a plate. The woman next door is eat­ing sup­per</p>
    <p>alone. She is sixty, per­haps, and for many years</p>
    <p>has eaten by her­self the toma­toes, the corn</p>
    <p>and okra that she grows in her back­yard gar­den.</p>
    <p>Her small metal­lic sound per­sists, as quiet al­most as the wind­less si­lence...”</p>
    <p>The hush of morn­ings at home is appealing and yet I miss the sounds of be­long­ing in of­fice. Tribes have a vo­cab­u­lary – ours is off­s­tone, cen­time­tres and “where’s your *&^% story” – and work­places own a hum. Else­where, too, phones ring and pens scratch, but in our of­fice, you hear the in­fi­nite pa­rade of ques­tions. Walk past a desk and you can hear cu­rios­ity at work. This is a build­ing of more sto­ries than it seems.</p>
    <p>One friend misses of­fice be­cause ev­ery day she and three work­mates at­tack the Guardian crossword to­gether. A col­league wryly tells me she misses her work space be­cause it is a refuge from her chil­dren’s end­less ques­tions and oc­ca­sional tantrums. Moth­ers aren’t 24-hour spelling saints. I miss my desk, near a win­dow, be­cause it is my spot and my post, my se­cu­rity and my iden­tity, my place in the world.</p>
    <p>I miss the re­tired po­lice­man on the train, the hefty woman with the hes­i­tant smile at the bus stop and the colour of my com­mute. I miss the oc­ca­sional minute of of­fice flirt­ing; Richard up­stairs in the can­teen who says “Ah, for­get it” if you’re 10 cents short on your bill; and the woman be­hind the lunch counter whose smile never wilts in ex­haus­tion. There were kind­nesses we re­ceived which we never stopped to count.</p>
    <p>In the quiet we hear our own heart­beat, but I miss the ver­bal dance of of­fice con­ver­sa­tion. Some days, this can be unadul­ter­ated, lib­er­at­ing gos­sip. Some days, a lit­tle more pro­found. Once, I lunched with a fel­low jour­nal­ist and who knows what we were discussing – fam­ily, grief, luck, re­silience – when she abruptly re­vealed that her mother died giv­ing birth to her. It stayed with me for days and, later, with her per­mis­sion, it turned into a col­umn on moth­er­hood.</p>
    <p>This is what I miss the most about of­fice, the in­ci­den­tal ex­changes, the ran­dom col­li­sions, the ac­ci­den­tal meet­ings which amuse, pro­voke, teach and shape us. At home, I’m in a tun­nel of sorts, in of­fice, in a meadow of di­verse ideas. I used to walk the editorial floor of­ten, usu­ally when a col­umn was de­feat­ing me, just a me­an­der past desks, paus­ing to chat or to linger at the stack of books on some­one’s desk.</p>
    <p>One day, I might meet an ed­i­tor who is a min­is­ter in his church and, an­other evening, a fel­low who is tak­ing imag­i­nary golf swings near a lift door. Both will tell me life moves in mys­te­ri­ous ways. There’s a con­stant os­mo­sis go­ing on, an ex­change, which leads some­how to some­one else’s Jack Daniels in my drawer. It is cur­rently and qui­etly age­ing and will not be re­turned.</p>
    <p>Net­flix can’t give me what the of­fice can, a peek through the real win­dow of oth­ers and this is what writ­ers need. To see hu­mans close up, ob­serve them, lis­ten. We eat meals out with col­leagues in restau­rants we’d never go to, we bend our­selves a lit­tle to the group, we man­age dif­fer­ences, we see each other through clearer lenses. A writer in her 50s, in­tel­li­gent, prim on first glance, once tells me that in mid­dle age, she feels men do not de­sire her any more. It is blunt, star­tling, melan­cholic all at once, and it tells me of how lit­tle we know about peo­ple at the desk down the cor­ri­dor.</p>
    <p>We talk of­ten of friend­ship, but rarely about the value of col­leagues and the strength of ac­quain­tances. They may not come home for din­ner, but this as­so­ci­a­tion, for so many hours a day, ex­erts more in­flu­ence than we con­sider. We laugh, grunt, tease, ar­gue, show pho­to­graphs of a Mon­go­lian hol­i­day, pon­der a child’s growing vo­cab­u­lary, dis­cuss the breed­ing habits of cocker spaniels, ar­gue the United States’ right wing and</p>
    <p>Rafael Nadal’s left hand.</p>
    <p>I run in the af­ter­noon, but my brain needs its own var­ied work­out, which no de­vice can of­fer me. I de­sire con­tact and, on the best days, it’s like a field of tiny light bulbs is go­ing off in my nico­tine-scarred brain. We all have set in­ter­ests, but our minds need to go astray and col­leagues help us wan­der, they pro­voke us with a new thought and take us to­wards a point of view we’d not con­sid­ered. Some­times they just make us feel. Some­one’s story is spiked, an in­ter­vie­wee is rude, a wake must be at­tended.</p>
    <p>Em­pa­thy is ex­er­cised and th­ese most hu­man things can be­come lost to us when locked at home.</p>
    <p>Per­haps, the of­fice as we knew it is the past and, for the next few years, we’ll ex­ist in a muf­fled, muz­zled world. Per­haps we’ll work mostly from home, un­di­vided from our do­mes­tic life, where sen­tences on Lionel Messi must be imag­ined over fry­ing onions. Life is ad­just­ment and we, the for­tu­nate, will be fine, and yet, I will long for those daily de­par­tures out into the world. Stay­ing home has a steadi­ness, yet with­out the of­fice, I feel un­moored. Like a ship which never comes in.</p>
