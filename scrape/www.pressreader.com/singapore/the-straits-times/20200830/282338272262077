    <p>For Aus­tralian Paul de Gelder, a hor­ri­fy­ing bite from a bull shark in 2009 cost him a hand and a leg, chang­ing his life for­ever.</p>
    <p>But he nei­ther blames nor fears the crea­ture which at­tacked him. In­stead, he now ad­vo­cates for the con­ser­va­tion, preser­va­tion and pro­tec­tion of sharks. He is one of the stars on the Dis­cov­ery Chan­nel pro­gramme Shark Week, whose 32nd edi­tion airs from to­mor­row to Sept 6.</p>
    <p>Over a Zoom call from Los An­ge­les, where he is based, the 43-yearold tells The Sun­day Times: “I try to break down these pre­con­ceived no­tions that sharks are vi­cious, sav­age man-eaters lurk­ing in the oceans, wait­ing to kill us all. That is what we see in the movies, it is just not true.”</p>
    <p>Sharks are not that in­ter­ested in hu­mans, he says, adding that most of their life is spent look­ing for food. “And if we are flap­ping around on the sur­face, we look like an in­jured an­i­mal.”</p>
    <p>That was prob­a­bly what hap­pened on Feb 11, 2009, the fate­ful day of his at­tack, which the former Royal Aus­tralian Navy clear­ance diver de­tails in his 2011 au­to­bi­og­ra­phy No Time For Fear.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a counter-ter­ror­ism ex­er­cise in Syd­ney Har­bour, he was in the wa­ter when he felt a blow to his right leg.</p>
    <p>Look­ing down, he saw the gi­ant grey head of a 3m-long shark, with its lip pulled back, the up­per row of its teeth on his leg. His right wrist was also in its mouth.</p>
    <p>Once he got over the shock, Mr de Gelder tried to stab the crea­ture’s eye with his left hand, but could not reach it. So he punched its nose as hard as he could, af­ter which the beast started shak­ing him, its teeth saw­ing on his limbs.</p>
    <p>That was when he started feel­ing pain and the shark pulled him un­der wa­ter. “I could only see bubbles in front of my face,” Mr de Gelder writes. “There was just a deep si­lence. And then, just as sud­denly, the shark was gone.”</p>
    <p>Reach­ing the sur­face, he be­gan swim­ming to a safety boat, but dis­cov­ered that his hand was gone. The ham­string from his leg had also been torn and a plume of red blood – his own – sur­rounded him.</p>
    <p>At that mo­ment, Mr de Gelder thought he was go­ing to die. Thank­fully, the safety boat reached him and his team­mates pulled him out of the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>He was im­me­di­ately sent to hos­pi­tal, where he un­der­went a mas­sive blood trans­fu­sion. His se­verely da­m­aged leg was also even­tu­ally am­pu­tated above the knee.</p>
    <p>Over time, Mr de Gelder got bet­ter, was dis­charged and picked up the pieces. He was de­ter­mined to make the best of it. He learnt how to brush his teeth and cook with one hand.</p>
    <p>Af­ter get­ting pros­thetic limbs, he can now use a dust­pan and broom as well as drive a car, ride a mod­i­fied mo­tor­cy­cle, run, dive and even para­chute.</p>
    <p>Can he thread a nee­dle and sew a but­ton? “Oh yes, I have sewn many but­tons,” he says. “I use my teeth a lot.”</p>
    <p>He cur­rently has sev­eral sets of pros­thetic limbs – a robotic hand, three robotic walk­ing legs, a run­ning blade, a snow­board­ing leg, two div­ing legs and two weightlift­ing arms.</p>
    <p>“My lug­gage gets re­ally heavy when I travel,” quips Mr de Gelder, who is in a re­la­tion­ship and is now a mo­ti­va­tional speaker.</p>
    <p>In 2010, he also dab­bled in mod­el­ling for an Aus­tralian men’s un­der­wear and swimwear line. He has ap­peared as a guest on ev­ery ma­jor Aus­tralian tele­vi­sion talk show, as well as many in the United States.</p>
    <p>The new edi­tion of Shark Week kicks off with a spe­cial episode, in which Mr de Gelder coaches Hol­ly­wood ac­tor Will Smith to over­come his life­long fear of sharks. It is ti­tled Will Smith: Off The Deep End and airs to­mor­row at 9pm on Dis­cov­ery Chan­nel.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing watched all of Smith’s movies, such as The Pur­suit Of Hap­py­ness (2006) and I Am Leg­end (2007), Mr de Gelder says: “You see this larger-than-life char­ac­ter on the big screen play­ing all of these in­cred­i­ble peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>But when he got to spend time with Smith, he re­alised that, deep down, the star was no dif­fer­ent from reg­u­lar folk. “He still has fears, wor­ries and things in his life that he needs to get over.”</p>
    <p>And like any other fear, he says the fear of sharks can be over­come.</p>
    <p>“Like every­one else that I take div­ing with sharks, they get out of the wa­ter and the first thing they say is: ‘That was prob­a­bly the best thing I have ever done in my life.’”</p>
    <p>Asked what tra­jec­tory his life might have taken had it not been for the shark bite, Mr de Gelder says: “I wouldn’t change it any­more, be­cause I don’t know who that per­son would be – what he would be do­ing, whether he would be happy.</p>
    <p>“I know who I am now and I get to live an in­cred­i­ble life. I don’t re­ally feel sorry for my­self at all.”</p>
