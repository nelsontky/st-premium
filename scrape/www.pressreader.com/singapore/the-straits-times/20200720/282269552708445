    <p>If there is one thing the global coro­n­avirus pan­demic has shown, it is the po­ten­tial of tech­nol­ogy to re­shape our lives.</p>
    <p>Re­mote work­ing, dis­tant learn­ing, on­line trans­ac­tions, tele­con­fer­enc­ing and even telemedici­ne have all grad­u­ated from dis­tant pos­si­bil­i­ties to be­come com­mon and cur­rent re­al­ity over the past five months.</p>
    <p>This, in turn, has rekin­dled the de­bate over the op­por­tu­ni­ties and chal­lenges posed by tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>While most ob­servers would agree that tech­nol­ogy driven by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) im­proves lives, just as many now fear its im­pact on jobs and in­comes.</p>
    <p>This fear has ex­isted for many years, though not as per­va­sively in pub­lic dis­course as it does now.</p>
    <p>But the fears are not un­founded. In 2013, Ox­ford Univer­sity aca­demics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Os­borne used a ma­chine-learn­ing al­go­rithm to as­sess how eas­ily 702 dif­fer­ent kinds of jobs in the United States could be au­to­mated.</p>
    <p>They found that fully 47 per cent could be done by ma­chines over the next decade or two. In short, half of all jobs could be taken over by AI and ma­chines by 2025.</p>
    <p>In an­other study in 2018 – this time fo­cused on Sin­ga­pore – Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers pro­jected three AI-driven tech­nol­ogy waves rock­ing the lo­cal job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The al­go­rith­mic wave, which would see au­to­ma­tion of many sim­pler com­pu­ta­tional tasks, would lead to 4 per cent of jobs be­ing lost.</p>
    <p>This would be fol­lowed by the aug­men­ta­tion wave, which would see job losses of 18 per cent as ro­bot­ics is in­creas­ingly ap­plied in the man­u­fac­tur­ing and sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>Next would be the au­tonomous wave, where 26 per cent of jobs would be lost as au­to­ma­tion re­places phys­i­cal labour, man­ual dex­ter­ity and “prob­lem solv­ing in dy­namic real world sit­u­a­tions that re­quire re­spon­sive ac­tions, such as in trans­port and con­struc­tion” by the 2030s.</p>
    <p>Other stud­ies sug­gested that as much as a third of the jobs now un­der­taken by hu­man be­ings can be re­placed by AI-pow­ered smart ma­chines by 2025.</p>
    <p>In 2017, a Cisco re­port cited global ma­chine-to-ma­chine con­nec­tions in the in­dus­try grow­ing at a 30 per cent com­pounded an­nual growth rate.</p>
    <p>While dire warn­ings about these “weapons of maths” de­struc­tion have come from no lesser tech­no­log­i­cal he­roes than Mr Elon Musk and Mr Jack Ma, pro­po­nents of AI point out that tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion has gen­er­ally im­proved the lot of mankind.</p>
    <p>Still, polls show that four in 10 work­ers are wor­ried that their jobs could dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>Not help­ing is the “Ter­mi­na­tor” ar­gu­ment that smart, self-learn­ing ma­chines could some­day sim­ply re­place hu­mans al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to this ar­gu­ment, self-learn­ing ma­chines will steadily ac­quire enough in­tel­li­gence to one day ques­tion the need for im­ped­i­ments to ef­fi­ciency, namely hu­mans. And thus they could ul­ti­mately choose to re­place and ex­ter­mi­nate their mak­ers.</p>
    <p>While at­ten­tion-grab­bing, the ar­gu­ment misses some key points.</p>
    <p>In­deed, some jobs will be lost.</p>
    <p>But ma­chines don’t have com­mon sense or heuris­tic ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Even the smartest ma­chines can make dumb de­ci­sions. (Re­mem­ber the fatal Tesla self-driv­ing car crash caused by the AI not recog­nis­ing a truck?)</p>
    <p>Also, data can fall into the wrong hands.</p>
    <p>Hu­man in­ter­ven­tion and in­put will al­ways be crit­i­cal. In this new world, new sets of skills will be needed. Skills such as cod­ing, Web de­sign, pro­gram­ming, data an­a­lyt­ics, cy­ber se­cu­rity, e-com­merce man­age­ment, dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing and more.</p>
    <p>But some work­ers will in­vari­ably be left be­hind. Re­search firm For­rester con­cluded that 29 per cent of jobs will be lost by 2030, with only about 13 per cent job cre­ation to com­pen­sate.</p>
    <p>How so­ci­eties deal with folks who strug­gle to adapt to the new econ­omy will de­ter­mine po­lit­i­cal, so­cial and eco­nomic out­comes.</p>
    <p>While a lot of ink has been spilt on de­scrib­ing the im­pact of tech­no­log­i­cal change on jobs, there has been much less dis­cus­sion on its im­pact on busi­ness.</p>
    <p>AI’s im­pact on busi­ness will be no less pro­found and per­ma­nent, as busi­ness mod­els will be chal­lenged by lower bar­ri­ers to en­try, chang­ing cost struc­tures and com­pe­ti­tion for tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses will also have to ad­just to a world where re­mote work­ing, we­bi­nars and cross-bor­der satel­lite oper­a­tions and of­fices be­come the norm. The dy­nam­ics of ac­cess to cross-bor­der tal­ent could change.</p>
    <p>How busi­nesses man­age these chal­lenges will de­ter­mine their rel­e­vance and sur­viv­abil­ity. While many larger global com­pa­nies have the re­sources to man­age the change, smaller lo­cal play­ers could strug­gle to cope.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment poli­cies and as­sis­tance will be cru­cial.</p>
    <p>In­dus­tries likely to be most im­pacted could be trans­port, sup­ply chain man­age­ment and lo­gis­tics, man­u­fac­tur­ing and fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like ed­u­ca­tion, health­care, food ser­vices and ac­com­mo­da­tion are likely to have longer lead times to ad­just.</p>
    <p>But, as For­rester noted, de­spite apoc­a­lyp­tic pre­dic­tions, the full im­pli­ca­tions of au­to­ma­tion are still un­known.</p>
    <p>Still, the ad­vent of AI is sim­ply one more in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion in the his­tory of mankind.</p>
    <p>The first no­table one took place in the 1800s, when agrar­ian so­ci­ety moved to­wards in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion with the ad­vent of ma­chines.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion came in the early 1900s, with the dis­cov­ery of elec­tric­ity. This sim­ply speeded up the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of so­ci­ety, while also adding more con­ve­nience to life in gen­eral.</p>
    <p>Then in the 1980s, the tech­no­log­i­cal rev­o­lu­tion kicked off, with dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and com­put­ers emerg­ing.</p>
    <p>So AI is sim­ply the lat­est avatar of pro­gres­sive evo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Each of the pre­vi­ous rev­o­lu­tions was ini­tially met by con­ster­na­tion and fear. But ul­ti­mately, a new nor­mal was es­tab­lished. New – and more – jobs were cre­ated. Greater op­por­tu­ni­ties arose. Life im­proved for the ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>And the world did not im­plode. As the Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton’s AI spe­cial­ist Pedro Domin­gos once noted, the real ques­tion is not about man ver­sus ma­chine. It is about how man can har­ness ma­chines to im­prove lives, cure dis­eases, cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties and re­duce costs.</p>
