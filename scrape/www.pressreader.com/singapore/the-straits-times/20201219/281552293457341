    <p>US Covid-19 deaths topped 3,000 for a third straight day on Thurs­day, as the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion worked rapidly to­wards grant­ing emer­gency ap­proval for Moderna’s vac­cine.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON US deaths from Covid-19 topped 3,000 for a third straight day, with a record num­ber of new in­fec­tions on Thurs­day, just as the US pre­pared to ship out nearly six mil­lion doses of a new vac­cine upon its ex­pected au­tho­ri­sa­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The United States re­ported a record 239,903 new cases on Thurs­day, rais­ing the cu­mu­la­tive num­ber to more than 17 mil­lion since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­gan nearly a year ago.</p>
    <p>The US death toll now ex­ceeds 311,000.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts have warned of a deep­en­ing cri­sis this win­ter as in­ten­sive care units (ICUs) fill up and hos­pi­tal beds spill over into hall­ways. US hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions have set a new record on each of the past 20 days, ap­proach­ing 114,000 on Thurs­day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect to have more dead bodies than we have spa­ces for them,” Los An­ge­les Mayor Eric Garcetti told a brief­ing on Thurs­day, say­ing the coun­try’s sec­ond­largest city had fully ex­hausted its ICU ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>To help slow the pan­demic, the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) has promised to work rapidly to­wards grant­ing emer­gency ap­proval of Moderna’s Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date, a week af­ter au­tho­ris­ing the first vac</p>
    <p>cine from Pfizer and German part­ner BioNTech.</p>
    <p>A panel of out­side ad­vis­ers to the FDA over­whelm­ingly en­dorsed the emer­gency use of Moderna’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Fi­nal au­tho­ri­sa­tion could come yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar told CNBC on Thurs­day that 5.9 mil­lion Moderna vac­cine doses had been al­lot­ted for state gov­ern­ments to re­ceive and were ready to dis­trib­ute na­tion­wide start­ing this week­end.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said yes­ter­day that the US has au­tho­rised Moderna’s vac­cine, jump­ing the gun on reg­u­la­tors who have yet to give it the for­mal green light. “Moderna vac­cine over­whelm­ingly ap­proved. Distri­bu­tion to start im­me­di­ately,” he wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Both vac­cines re­quire two doses,</p>
    <p>given three or four weeks apart, for each per­son in­oc­u­lated.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties have sought to re­as­sure Amer­i­cans that large-scale clin­i­cal tri­als and sci­en­tific re­view found the vac­cines to be safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence re­ceived his Covid-19 vac­cine live on tele­vi­sion, seek­ing to shore up pub­lic sup­port for vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence, his wife Karen Pence, and Sur­geon-Gen­eral Jerome Adams each rolled up their sleeves and took in­jec­tions from med­i­cal staff, be­com­ing the high­est-pro­file re­cip­i­ents to re­ceive the vac­cine pub­licly. “I didn’t feel a thing. Well done,” said Mr Pence, the leader of the White House coro­n­avirus task force.</p>
    <p>They were in­jected with the vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioN</p>
    <p>Tech that the FDA au­tho­rised for emer­gency use a week ago.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an­swer­ing rou­tine ques­tions about their health, the three of them took their in­jec­tions at the Eisen­hower Ex­ec­u­tive Of­fice Build­ing in the White House cam­pus, seated in front of a blue cur­tain and screens that de­clared, “Safe and Ef­fec­tive” and “Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed”.</p>
    <p>They could be fol­lowed by a pa­rade of po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, part of a cam­paign to over­come pub­lic scep­ti­cism about the safety of vac­cines, which un­der­went large-scale clin­i­cal tri­als and sci­en­tific re­view.</p>
    <p>For­mer pres­i­dents Bill Clin­ton, Ge­orge W. Bush and Barack Obama have vol­un­teered for pub­lic in­oc­u­la­tions, and Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den, who is due to take of­fice on Jan 20, will get his next week, his aides said.</p>
    <p>US in­fec­tious disease ex­pert An­thony Fauci, tapped to be Mr Bi­den’s chief med­i­cal ad­viser, told NBC’s To­day show yes­ter­day that he would get vac­ci­nated as soon as he could and was wait­ing for doses to ar­rive at the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health.</p>
    <p>US law­mak­ers are mean­while con­sid­er­ing pro­vid­ing pay­roll as­sis­tance for aero­space man­u­fac­tur­ers and sup­pli­ers as part of a mas­sive US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) Covid-19 relief Bill, con­gres­sional aides told Reuters.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to con­gres­sional lead­ers on Thurs­day seen by Reuters, 11 se­na­tors pro­posed “the fed­eral govern­ment would pay up to 50 per cent of the pay­roll costs for up to 25 per cent of a man­u­fac­turer’s work­force” for aero­space man­u­fac­tur­ers and sup­pli­ers.</p>
