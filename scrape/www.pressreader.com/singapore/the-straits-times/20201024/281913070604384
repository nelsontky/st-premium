    <p>In the fi­nal pres­i­den­tial de­bate on Thurs­day, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den made their case on why Amer­i­cans should vote for them with just un­der two weeks to go to elec­tion day. Here are some de­bate high­lights:</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>CORO­N­AVIRUS</p>
    <p>The de­bate high­lighted stark dif­fer­ences i n both men’s views of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in the United States, which is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing what some are de­scrib­ing as a third surge in cases, this time cen­tred on the Mid­west.</p>
    <p>The au­di­ence was left to weigh whether they thought Mr Trump had a plan, de­cide whose pre­dic­tion of the fu­ture they found more sen­si­ble, and choose whether to find Mr Trump re­spon­si­ble for Amer­ica’s 220,000 coro­n­avirus deaths so far.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump made a rosy pre­dic­tion that the virus “will go away” and that the US is “round­ing the turn”, as­sert­ing that a vac­cine could be just weeks away – a claim he has been mak­ing for weeks.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Mr Bi­den warned that Amer­ica was about to en­ter a “dark win­ter”, echo­ing ear­lier warn­ings by public health ex­perts and of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>This, said Mr Bi­den, was com­pounded by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s lack of a clear plan for con­tain­ing the coro­n­avirus and the like­li­hood that a vac­cine would not be avail­able for a ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans be­fore the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump replied: “I don’t know if we’re go­ing to have a dark win­ter at all. We’re open­ing up our coun­try. We’ve learnt and stud­ied, and un­der­stand the dis­ease, which we didn’t at the be­gin­ning.”</p>
    <p>Asked to lay out his plan on deal­ing with the virus go­ing for­ward, the Pres­i­dent said it was a world­wide prob­lem and de­fended his ini­tial han­dling of the out­break. Mr Bi­den said he would urge ev­ery­one to wear a mask all the time, in­vest in rapid test­ing, and help schools and busi­nesses to re­open safely.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said Amer­i­cans were learn­ing to live with the virus, to which Mr Bi­den replied: “Learn­ing to live with it? We’re dy­ing with it.”</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>FOR­EIGN POL­ICY AND EN­TAN­GLE­MENTS</p>
    <p>The two dis­cussed their for­eign pol­icy on China and North Korea, but the de­bate was mostly a re­hash of po­si­tions and crit­i­cisms they had stated be­fore.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­peated his ar­gu­ment that China footed the bill for his trade war’s tar­iffs – a claim roundly re­jected by econ­o­mists, who say the cost is borne by tax­pay­ers in­stead.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who has said he would fo­cus on in­ter­na­tional norms and al­liances as pres­i­dent, said he would make China play by in­ter­na­tional rules. He also slammed Mr Trump for “em­brac­ing thugs” like Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
    <p>But the de­bate turned to fo­cus heav­ily on both men’s po­ten­tial for­eign en­tan­gle­ments, with a de­tailed back and forth on Mr Trump’s taxes and deals, and the busi­ness deal­ings in China of Mr Bi­den’s son, Hunter.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Bi­den: “I have not taken a penny from any for­eign source ever in my life... You have not re­leased a sin­gle soli­tary year of your tax re­turn. What are you hid­ing? Why are you un­will­ing? The for­eign coun­tries are pay­ing you a lot.”</p>
    <p>For­eign relations watch­ers were not im­pressed. “The in­ad­e­quacy of the na­tional se­cu­rity sec­tion of the de­bate un­der­scores why (the Com­mis­sion on Pres­i­den­tial De­bates) erred in not hav­ing one de­bate de­voted to for­eign pol­icy. Worse, most of tonight’s ex­change was not about for­eign pol­icy but about al­leged cor­rup­tion,” wrote Coun­cil on For­eign Relations pres­i­dent Richard Haass on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>TRADITIONA­L DE­BATE</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the first de­bate, which was a mess of crosstalk and in­ter­rup­tions, Thurs­day’s de­bate was rel­a­tively se­date and civil. This was likely at least par­tially due to a rule change that muted each speaker’s mi­cro­phone dur­ing the other can­di­date’s open­ing an­swer. And though there was a dash of in­sults – Mr Trump mocked Mr Bi­den for “hid­ing” in his base­ment in­stead of hit­ting the cam­paign trail hard, while Mr Bi­den ac­cused Mr Trump of golf­ing in­stead of work­ing on a virus relief pack­age with Con­gress – they were nowhere near the in­ten­sity and ran­cour of the first de­bate.</p>
    <p>The change would have re­as­sured, and was pos­si­bly also aimed at, un­de­cided vot­ers who did not like the Pres­i­dent’s com­bat­ive man­ner in the first de­bate. Sev­eral polls found that most peo­ple thought Mr Bi­den won the pre­vi­ous de­bate.</p>
    <p>The ci­vil­ity of the lat­est de­bate al­lowed more time for the can­di­dates to delve into pol­icy, with health­care, im­mi­gra­tion and cli­mate change among the is­sues they sparred over.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>A RACIST PRES­I­DENT?</p>
    <p>The clos­ing seg­ment of the de­bate was about race is­sues, but quickly turned into a ref­er­en­dum on the Pres­i­dent and his char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>“I am the least racist per­son in this room,” Mr Trump said in re­sponse to whether his com­ments, in­clud­ing call­ing the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment a sym­bol of hate and shar­ing a video of a man chant­ing “white power”, en­cour­aged ra­cial strife.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to his pass­ing of crim­i­nal jus­tice re­form and prison re­form poli­cies, Mr Trump said no­body else had done more for the black com­mu­nity, with the ex­cep­tion of found­ing fa­ther Abra­ham Lin­coln.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said, sar­cas­ti­cally: “Abra­ham Lin­coln here is one of the most racist pres­i­dents we’ve had in mod­ern his­tory. He pours fuel on ev­ery sin­gle racist fire... he has a dog whis­tle as big as a foghorn.”</p>
    <p>Who was this ex­change aimed at? Black vot­ers have been solidly be­hind Mr Bi­den, although Mr Trump has gained some ground among black men, and were un­likely to be swayed. A New York Times-Siena Col­lege na­tional poll on Tues­day found that 90 per cent of black vot­ers said they would vote for Mr Bi­den, while 4 per cent said they would go for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the ex­change was more likely aimed at white vot­ers un­com­fort­able with the Pres­i­dent’s state­ments on race is­sues, who might re­ject him on the ba­sis of that.</p>
