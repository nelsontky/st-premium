    <p>A num­ber of Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates are un­der­go­ing late-stage tri­als and if suc­cess­ful, may be used to in­oc­u­late mil­lions from as early as next month. Se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik speaks to ex­perts to un­der­stand who should be given pri­or­ity and how much pro­tec­tion the vac­cines can give, among other things.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates are un­der­go­ing lat­estage tri­als and if suc­cess­ful, may be used to in­oc­u­late mil­lions from as early as next month.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has been in talks with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies work­ing on some of them, to se­cure doses for peo­ple here, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Pfizer, the United States com­pany which an­nounced that the vac­cine it is de­vel­op­ing with Ger­man com­pany BioNTech has proven 90 per cent ef­fec­tive in clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>Given the strong de­mand for Covid-19 vac­cines world­wide, Sin­ga­pore is un­likely to get enough for ev­ery per­son here in the ini­tial months, or even in the first year, es­pe­cially since many re­quire two doses per per­son.</p>
    <p>A com­mit­tee has been formed to pri­ori­tise the peo­ple who should be given the vac­cines as they be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts ex­plain who should be given pri­or­ity, how much pro­tec­tion these vac­cines will likely give, and give their thoughts on whether life can re­vert to preCovid-19 days after the vac­cines are rolled out.</p>
    <p>Q Should Sin­ga­pore go with the first vac­cines avail­able or wait for one that might be more ef­fec­tive or safer?</p>
    <p>A Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong of DukeNUS Med­i­cal School, who is the prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor for one of the 48 Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates cur­rently in hu­man tri­als around the world, said the de­ci­sion will de­pend on how high the risk of in­fec­tion is.</p>
    <p>If the risk is high, it makes sense to take what­ever is avail­able.</p>
    <p>But he added that wait­ing a few months will not change much of the in­for­ma­tion avail­able.</p>
    <p>“Early re­sults would all be show­ing short-term pro­tec­tion against Covid-19. There would not be suf­fi­cient data to know which would of­fer the best long-term pro­tec­tion against Covid-19,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal (NUH), said tak­ing what­ever vac­cine is avail­able is im­por­tant to “pre­vent spread, pre­vent dis­ease and hos­pi­tals get­ting over­whelmed, and to pre­vent deaths”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if these are not pri­or­i­ties, then coun­tries can af­ford to wait to see if there are “yet uniden­ti­fied ad­verse re­ac­tions” and how long the vac­cine is ef­fec­tive for.</p>
    <p>He added that it is still un­clear how the vac­cines will af­fect the el­derly, those who are im­mune sup­pressed or suf­fer from se­vere ill­ness.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said that be­fore vac­cines be­come com­mer­cially avail­able, the re­sults of their li­cens­ing tri­als will al­ready be pub­lic so “it will be rea­son­ably clear how ef­fec­tive and safe they are com­pared with one an­other”.</p>
    <p>He added: “If the first vac­cine is ef­fec­tive and safe, and the oth­ers in the pipe­line are sim­i­lar, then there is lit­tle ben­e­fit to hold­ing out other than wait­ing to see if there is a sig­nif­i­cant price dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>Q Is a per­son pro­tected im­me­di­ately after get­ting vac­ci­nated? Does pro­tec­tion kick in after the first dose of a two-dose vac­cine?</p>
    <p>A Many of the vac­cines re­quire two doses, given about a month apart. Prof Ooi said most clin­i­cal tri­als of Covid-19 vac­cines start to mea­sure ef­fi­cacy two weeks after the full dose has been given.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said that for vac­cines that man­u­fac­tur­ers say re­quire two doses, it will take two doses to pro­vide ef­fec­tive pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>He added that Pfizer mea­sured ef­fi­cacy 28 days after the sec­ond vac­cine dose. If the sec­ond dose is not taken close to the 21 to 28 days stip­u­lated, “then the first dose will be wasted”.</p>
    <p>Prof Hsu said that while the first dose will give some pro­tec­tion, “miss­ing out the sec­ond dose for a long pe­riod of time may negate the booster ef­fect” which is im­por­tant to achieve the full pro­tec­tion of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Q Is there any ad­van­tage in a pop­u­la­tion get­ting a range of vac­cines, rather than just us­ing one for the whole coun­try?</p>
    <p>A Given the huge de­mand for vac­cines, coun­tries may not have much choice about which and how many vac­cines they can get.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said the de­ci­sion about which vac­cines to use should be based on the safety and ef­fi­cacy data from their phase three clin­i­cal tri­als. How­ever, it might not make sense to com­pare across tri­als as their de­signs may be so dif­fer­ent as to make this dif­fi­cult to do.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said there is no ad­van­tage in us­ing sev­eral types of vac­cines un­less they re­spond dif­fer­ently in dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, some vac­cines might be more ef­fec­tive for older or sick peo­ple, oth­ers might have more ad­verse re­ac­tions for them but work well in healthy peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The main ad­van­tage of us­ing dif­fer­ent Covid-19 vac­cines, said Prof Hsu, “is that there will be mul­ti­ple sup­ply lines so we can ob­tain a greater num­ber of vac­cine doses for the pop­u­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>Q How many dif­fer­ent types of vac­cines will likely be avail­able by next year?</p>
    <p>A Prof Fisher, who chairs the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Global Out­break Alert and Re­sponse Net­work, said there are more than 200 vac­cine can­di­dates, of which 48 are in hu­man tri­als. There are al­ready 11 in the fi­nal phase three clin­i­cal tri­als and some of these should be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>But he added: “This doesn’t mean all vac­cines will be ac­cept­able. In­deed many won’t be ad­e­quately ef­fec­tive or safe.”</p>
    <p>Prof Hsu said he ex­pects at least four to five vac­cines by next year, with some be­com­ing avail­able within months of each other.</p>
    <p>Q How long will the pro­tec­tion from the vac­cines last? Will it be like the in­fluenza vac­cine, which needs to be taken an­nu­ally?</p>
    <p>A It is too early to know. How­ever, all the vac­cine com­pa­nies will be car­ry­ing out post-mar­ket­ing sur­veil­lance which will be able to tell if booster vac­ci­na­tions will be needed, and if so, when they should be given.</p>
    <p>Prof Hsu said: “The du­ra­tion of im­mu­nity after nat­u­ral in­fec­tion re­mains un­known at this point, and vac­cines do not gen­er­ally pro­vide longer-last­ing pro­tec­tion com­pared with nat­u­ral in­fec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Q What does it mean when a vac­cine is 90 per cent ef­fec­tive?</p>
    <p>A It means that among peo­ple tak­ing part in a clin­i­cal trial, those who had re­ceived the vac­cine were only one-tenth as likely to con­tact Covid-19, com­pared with those on placebo.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said not enough is known about those who did get in­fected. It may have been pos­si­ble they were in­fected be­fore the vac­cine took ef­fect. All that tells us, he said, is that some­one who has been vac­ci­nated “prob­a­bly” will not get Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher ex­plained that in the Pfizer trial, of the 22,000 peo­ple who re­ceived the vac­cine, only eight were in­fected. Of 22,000 who were given a placebo, 86 were in­fected.</p>
    <p>“This is why we should watch this group of 44,000 peo­ple to see what hap­pens to more peo­ple over time,” he said.</p>
    <p>Q Once some­one is vac­ci­nated, would it serve as a pass­port to go about with­out a mask or so­cial dis­tanc­ing?</p>
    <p>A Not in the early stages, said Prof Cook, but “when suf­fi­cient peo­ple are be­ing vac­ci­nated to reach herd im­mu­nity, then we could in prin­ci­ple make safe dis­tanc­ing op­tional”.</p>
    <p>Prof Hsu said peo­ple who have been vac­ci­nated would not know if they form the 90 per cent who are pro­tected or the 10 per cent who are not, un­less they un­dergo test­ing to see if they have de­vel­oped an im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said it would be dif­fi­cult to personalis­e rules.</p>
    <p>Q What pro­por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion needs to be vac­ci­nated for herd im­mu­nity to kick in?</p>
    <p>A That re­ally de­pends on what the vac­cine does, said Prof Ooi.</p>
    <p>The pri­mary goal now is for vac­cines to pro­tect against the dis­ease, which means a per­son may get in­fected but not get sick. But this per­son might still pass the virus on to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>It is only if the vac­cine pro­tects against in­fec­tion that herd im­mu­nity can build up, since that would break the chain of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook added that with a vac­cine that is 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, about 60 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion needs to be vac­ci­nated to con­fer herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Prof Hsu added: “This doesn’t mean that there will be no more Covid-19 cases. Just that out­breaks will be smaller and will nat­u­rally burn out each time they oc­cur.”</p>
    <p>Q Who should be given pri­or­ity for the vac­cines?</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore has set up a 14-mem­ber com­mit­tee to look into this but some coun­tries have al­ready pub­lished their pri­or­ity list.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, it will start with peo­ple aged 80 years and older, as well as health and care work­ers. The next group are those 65 years and older, then younger high-risk in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily doc­tors will drive the im­mu­ni­sa­tion ex­er­cise there, and will have to pri­ori­tise their other clin­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties to cope with the es­ti­mated 975 vac­ci­na­tions per week needed at each lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union is pri­ori­tis­ing peo­ple at risk and es­sen­tial work­ers, as well as con­cen­trat­ing first on ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tions with high in­ci­dence of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Canada will be vac­ci­nat­ing the el­derly, those with high-risk med­i­cal con­di­tions, as well as peo­ple most likely to trans­mit the dis­ease to the sus­cep­ti­ble groups. These in­clude health­care work­ers and care­givers in long-term care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Also on Canada’s pri­or­ity list are peo­ple needed to main­tain “es­sen­tial ser­vices for the func­tion­ing of so­ci­ety” such as fire­fight­ers and grocery store staff.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia said pri­or­ity groups in­clude the el­derly, aged-care and health work­ers, as well as other work­ers who are crit­i­cal to the func­tion­ing of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said Sin­ga­pore has a com­pact with health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>“They put them­selves in harm’s way by work­ing on the front lines, and we owe them the pro­tec­tion to keep them­selves well, as well as to avoid en­dan­ger­ing their pa­tients. This is a so­cial debt we owe them re­gard­less of their cit­i­zen­ship,” he added.</p>
    <p>He said given the stark dif­fer­ences in sur­vival rates be­tween older and younger peo­ple in­fected, the el­derly should also be given high pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said of­fer­ing vac­cines</p>
    <p>to health­care work­ers and trav­ellers can be jus­ti­fied. Given that there are about 100,000 peo­ple in health­care, in­clud­ing the 58,000 doc­tors and nurses, there may be a need to risk-strat­ify.</p>
    <p>He added: “In Sin­ga­pore our deaths have been in older peo­ple so I think we should fo­cus there, or on nurs­ing home work­ers.”</p>
    <p>Aside from those groups, Prof Fisher added: “In­deed our big­gest threat re­mains mi­grant worker out­breaks and that as a strat­egy could well be jus­ti­fied.”</p>
    <p>Q Should the Covid-19 vac­cine be vol­un­tary or com­pul­sory?</p>
    <p>A It should be vol­un­tary, said the ex­perts, es­pe­cially since there will not be enough for ev­ery­one at the be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>But Prof Cook added: “The ex­cep­tions are when you put oth­ers at acute risk by de­clin­ing vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, a front-line health­care worker who re­fuses the vac­cine is po­ten­tially putting her or his pa­tients at risk, and it’s ques­tion­able whether that is eth­i­cally ac­cept­able.”</p>
