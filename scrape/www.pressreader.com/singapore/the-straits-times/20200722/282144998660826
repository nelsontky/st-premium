    <p>With restau­rants either shut­tered or re­open­ing with vastly re­duced ca­pac­ity and people stay­ing home as sec­ond-wave out­breaks erupt, de­mand for food de­liv­ery ser­vices has ex­ploded.</p>
    <p>Now Mr Kishin R.K., the 36-yearold heir to a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar Singapore property em­pire, is join­ing the fray, cre­at­ing a net­work of 1,000 cloud kitchens across Asia, Europe and the United States to crack the lu­cra­tive home-de­liv­ery din­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, cloud kitchen rev­enue is es­ti­mated to climb to al­most US$72 bil­lion (S$100 bil­lion) by 2027 from US$43 bil­lion last year, ac­cord­ing to Al­lied Mar­ket Re­search.</p>
    <p>Also known as dark or shared kitchens, these cen­tralised op­er­a­tions can pump out an ar­ray of cuisines for es­tab­lished restau­rants look­ing to broaden their de­liv­ery foot­print, or for brands that ex­ist nowhere else but be­hind an app.</p>
    <p>They have be­come the go-to model for food de­liv­ery com­pa­nies look­ing to side­step the costs of run­ning tra­di­tional restau­rants with seat­ing and wait­ers, and can be lo­cated in cheaper premises like busi­ness parks rather than op­er­ate as high-street stores.</p>
    <p>“The in­vest­ment into cloud kitchens is an op­por­tu­nity to look at real estate with a dif­fer­ent lens and cre­ate rev­enue from a space which may not be as rel­e­vant any more,” said Mr Kishin, who founded TiffinLabs with three partners early last year, nam­ing it af­ter the In­dian lunches de­liv­ered by In­dia’s army of so-called dab­bawalas.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishin runs RB Cap­i­tal, a pri­vately owned property firm which, to­gether with his fa­ther Raj Ku­mar’s Royal Hold­ings, owns 13 of­fice tow­ers, malls and ho­tels in Singapore, in­clud­ing the re­cently re­fur­bished 225-room In­ter­Con­ti­nen­tal Singapore Robert­son Quay.</p>
    <p>That has left the family, which has an es­ti­mated net worth of about US$3 bil­lion, ex­posed to the city state’s strug­gling econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct shrank by a record last quar­ter, when much of the city was shut down to stem the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishin, who de­clined to com­ment on the family’s wealth, is try­ing to crack a crowded mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Panda Se­lected dom­i­nates i n China, De­liv­eroo plans to ex­pand its “Edi­tions” dark-kitchen con­cept in Europe, while Zuul and Kitchen United are ma­jor play­ers in the US. Uber Tech­nolo­gies’ former chief ex­ec­u­tive Travis Kalan­ick funded City Stor­age Sys­tems, which runs dark kitchens and last year reached a US$5 bil­lion val­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>TiffinLabs will take a slightly dif­fer­ent ap­proach. It will rent kitchens in restau­rants and those used by cater­ing firms – in­clu­sive of a rev­enue-shar­ing deal – then roll out its own brands like Publico Pasta Bar and Hu­raideu Korean Fried Chicken.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishin says that while he will em­ploy chefs and other kitchen staff, the beauty of it is that he can use one team to pro­duce mul­ti­ple cuisines, such as Ital­ian, Chi­nese and In­dian, from a sin­gle site.</p>
    <p>The first kitchen should open in the fourth quar­ter. TiffinLabs plans to have more than 30 restau­rant con­cepts serv­ing over 15 cuisines in at least 10 coun­tries within the next 12 months, ac­cord­ing to its web­site.</p>
    <p>One area where Mr Kishin will not com­pete with es­tab­lished play­ers is in ac­tual de­liv­ery – in­stead pre­fer­ring to part­ner ex­ist­ing plat­forms like Grab, Uber Eats and Food­panda.</p>
    <p>“I’m not mov­ing away from my real estate busi­ness,” he said. “I’m merely do­ing what is nec­es­sary to stay rel­e­vant and to move with the times.”</p>
    <p>RE­THINK­ING REAL ESTATE</p>
    <p>The in­vest­ment into cloud kitchens is an op­por­tu­nity to look at real estate with a dif­fer­ent lens and cre­ate rev­enue from a space which may not be as ’’ rel­e­vant any more.</p>
    <p>MR KISHIN R.K., heir to a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar Singapore property em­pire, re­fer­ring to phys­i­cal out­lets. He founded TiffinLabs with three partners early last year, nam­ing it af­ter the In­dian lunches de­liv­ered by In­dia’s army of so-called dab­bawalas.</p>
