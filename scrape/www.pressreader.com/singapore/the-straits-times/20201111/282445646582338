    <p>•</p>
    <p>The Premier League is the only com­pe­ti­tion out of the big five Euro­pean leagues that has not per­mit­ted five sub­sti­tutes this sea­son – a rule change world foot­ball au­thor­i­ties have ap­proved to deal with fix­ture con­ges­tion caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This has sparked in­tense de­bate since the start of the sea­son, with the mat­ter tak­ing on greater im­por­tance over the week­end af­ter ri­val man­agers Pep Guardi­ola of Manch­ester City and Liver­pool’s Jur­gen Klopp jointly im­plored the English top flight to relook the is­sue for the sake of player wel­fare.</p>
    <p>Reds de­fender Trent Alexan­derArnold suf­fered a calf in­jury dur­ing the 1-1 draw at the Eti­had and both bosses blamed his pro­jected four­week ab­sence on the lack of flex­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>When Pro­ject Restart got un­der way in June, five sub­sti­tutes were al­lowed but in early Au­gust, clubs over­whelm­ingly re­jected the rein­tro­duc­tion of the mea­sure.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the pro­posal was again put forth, but the BBC said that only 11 clubs were in favour – at least 14 out of the 20 clubs must give their sup­port for the mo­tion to be passed.</p>
    <p>Both re­jec­tions were down to a per­cep­tion that it favours big­ger clubs with deeper squads.</p>
    <p>But the Pro­fes­sional Foot­ballers’ As­so­ci­a­tion (PFA) on Mon­day lent its sup­port to the grow­ing calls, telling Sky Sports: “We told the Premier League we would sup­port such a move on health and safety grounds for our mem­bers be­fore the first vote and our po­si­tion has not changed.”</p>
    <p>Vin­cent Gout­te­barge, the chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer of play­ers’ union Fif­pro, has also called the re­sis­tance “pe­cu­liar”, telling The Guardian last week: “By con­trast, it (five subs) is al­lowed in the other ma­jor leagues in Europe and in the Cham­pi­ons League and Europa</p>
    <p>League, and it is ob­vi­ously one of our rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>“It would be nice to have the same ev­ery­where be­cause it pro­vides the man­ager with an op­por­tu­nity to rest some of his play­ers and per­haps man­age work­load bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, many of the Premier League’s lesser lights re­main stead­fast in their op­po­si­tion, al­though West Ham man­ager David Moyes,</p>
    <p>whose club re­jected the two ear­lier mo­tions, said last week he was will­ing to re­con­sider even though he still feels it “ben­e­fits big­ger squads and clubs with big­ger bud­gets”.</p>
    <p>Sh­effield United chief ex­ec­u­tive Stephen Bettis in­sisted his club will con­tinue to re­ject the rule as it af­fects the com­pe­ti­tion’s in­tegrity.</p>
    <p>“We re­main sus­pi­cious that big clubs sim­ply want to be able to sub</p>
    <p>off play­ers to rest them to keep them fresh... the big­ger the club, the stronger the bench,” he told Sky. “Any change of rules mid-sea­son will clearly af­fect the in­tegrity of the league... The 20 clubs have voted not once but twice to re­ject five subs.”</p>
    <p>The Premier League has al­ready made one rule change – over hand­balls – af­ter the sea­son started.</p>
    <p>Bettis added yes­ter­day: “So far this sea­son, clubs play­ing in Europe have en­dured a sim­i­lar work­load to clubs in the Cham­pi­onship and we don’t hear them com­plain­ing, do we? Here at Bra­mall Lane, we have not seen an in­crease in mus­cle in­juries.”</p>
    <p>As­ton Villa man­ager Dean Smith agreed, telling the BBC: “We have not got the big­gest squad in the</p>
    <p>LESS IN­TENSE</p>
    <p>It would be nice to have the same ev­ery­where be­cause it pro­vides the man­ager with an op­por­tu­nity to rest some of his play­ers and per­haps man­age work­load bet­ter.</p>
    <p>VIN­CENT GOUT­TE­BARGE, Fif­pro chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer, on the ben­e­fits of the rule.</p>
    <p>Any change of rules mid-sea­son will clearly af­fect the in­tegrity of the league... The 20 clubs have voted not once but twice to re­ject five subs.</p>
    <p>STEPHEN BETTIS, Sh­effield United CEO, on why his club will con­tinue to re­ject the rule.</p>
    <p>world and we have to man­age our play­ers. I made my feel­ings known from the off that I thought they were right to stay with the three­subs rule and now that we have started with it, we should cer­tainly con­tinue with it.”</p>
    <p>It is un­clear whether there will be a third vote. Ac­cord­ing to the BBC and The Guardian, there are no plans at the mo­ment.</p>
