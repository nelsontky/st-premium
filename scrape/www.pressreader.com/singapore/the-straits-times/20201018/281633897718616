    <p>Thou­sands of anti-govern­ment pro­test­ers in Bangkok massed in de­fi­ance yes­ter­day af­ter a po­lice crack­down a day ear­lier, al­leg­ing the govern­ment had used ex­ces­sive vi­o­lence and de­mand­ing Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha step down.</p>
    <p>Un­like last Fri­day, when the riot po­lice blasted pro­test­ers with water can­non be­fore ad­vanc­ing into crowds with shields and ba­tons, the se­cu­rity pres­ence yes­ter­day was light. The flash mobs ended peace­fully af­ter a few hours.</p>
    <p>This was the fourth con­sec­u­tive day of mass protests de­spite Mr Prayut’s dec­la­ra­tion of a “se­ri­ous emer­gency” in Bangkok last Thurs­day, which banned po­lit­i­cal gath­er­ings of five or more peo­ple and gave se­cu­rity of­fi­cers ex­ten­sive pow­ers to search and de­tain in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>The de­cree was made in re­sponse to a protest in in­ner Bangkok last Wed­nes­day that ap­peared to slow a mo­tor­cade bear­ing Queen Suthida and Prince Di­pangkorn Ras­mi­joti.</p>
    <p>Two pro­test­ers on the scene have been charged with en­dan­ger­ing the Queen, an of­fence that car­ries a po­ten­tial life sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut, ac­cord­ing to govern­ment spokesman Anucha Bu­ra­pachaisri, de­fended the po­lice break-up of last Fri­day’s rally at Pathumwan in­ter­sec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment con­ducted the op­er­a­tion to end the protest within le­gal con­ven­tions,” Mr Anucha said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It did not harm the rights and free­doms of any group of peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The events last Fri­day did not cre­ate win­ners or losers, but only loss to the coun­try, he added.</p>
    <p>“The Prime Min­is­ter asked the peo­ple to join hands in avoid­ing the protests and any un­law­ful vi­o­lence.”</p>
    <p>Anti-govern­ment pro­test­ers dis­persed by the po­lice amid the chaos last Fri­day surged back onto the streets yes­ter­day, this time pre­pared with um­brel­las and mo­tor­cy­cle hel­mets.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t have any weapons, only um­brel­las. How could they do this to us?” said a 23-year-old un­der­grad­u­ate who wanted to be known as Por.</p>
    <p>She was among thou­sands who oc­cu­pied the busy Lat Phrao in­ter­sec­tion for some four hours yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I am a lit­tle scared, but I feel I can­not sur­ren­der. The more of us are ar­rested, the more we need to come out. We can­not aban­don our friends.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Thai Lawyers for Hu­man Rights group, at least 72 peo­ple have been ar­rested in protest-re­lated cases since last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice shut down Bangkok’s en­tire elec­tric rail net­work yes­ter­day af­ter­noon in a bid to pre­vent pro­test­ers from con­gre­gat­ing.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, the peo­ple walked or piled into tuk-tuks to head to sites that were an­nounced via so­cial me­dia less than an hour be­fore the protests be­gan.</p>
    <p>Many of them were high school stu­dents who took turns con­demn­ing the govern­ment via loud­speak­ers as their peers sat on the tar­mac.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral key protest lead­ers ar­rested ear­lier con­tinue to be de­nied bail. They in­clude hu­man rights lawyer Arnon Nampa and Tham­masat Univer­sity stu­dents Parit Chi­warak and Panusaya Sithi­ji­rawat­tanakul.</p>
    <p>The trio have been vo­cal in ad­vo­cat­ing monar­chy re­form, a deeply taboo topic in Thai­land, where in­sult­ing the king or queen can land an of­fender in prison for up to 15 years.</p>
    <p>Their fiery speeches have opened the lid on pub­lic dis­cus­sion about the role of Thai­land’s monar­chy.</p>
    <p>King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn took own­er­ship of Crown Prop­erty Bureau’s multi­bil­lion-dol­lar as­sets two years ago and also con­trols two army units. He spends much of his time in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have ques­tioned his ex­pen­di­ture amid the eco­nomic hard­ship caused by the pan­demic, and are call­ing for his pow­ers to be trimmed in line with Thai­land’s sta­tus as a con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers also want amend­ments to the mil­i­tary-backed Con­sti­tu­tion, which they ar­gue favours Mr Prayut, who took power af­ter stag­ing a mil­i­tary coup in 2014.</p>
    <p>Mr Matthew Wheeler, a se­nior an­a­lyst with the In­ter­na­tional Cri­sis Group, wrote in a note re­leased last Fri­day that the need for “a fresh con­cord on the monar­chy’s chang­ing role” was “daunt­ing”.</p>
    <p>“Govern­ment of­fi­cials and roy­al­ists in­sist that pub­lic dis­cus­sion of this role is off lim­its, but their po­si­tion is, in the light of re­cent events, anachro­nis­tic.</p>
    <p>“The de­gree of re­pres­sion nec­es­sary to ef­fec­tively re­in­state the pro­hi­bi­tion, in­clud­ing on­line, would tar­nish both the govern­ment and the monar­chy.”</p>
