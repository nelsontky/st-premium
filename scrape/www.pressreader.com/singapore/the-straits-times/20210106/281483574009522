    <p>The slump in Sin­ga­pore’s re­tail sec­tor last year eased fur­ther in Novem­ber, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Depart­ment of Statis­tics yes­ter­day. This was due to mega sales events and mo­bile phone launches.</p>
    <p>The slump in Sin­ga­pore’s re­tail sales eased fur­ther in Novem­ber, thanks to mega sales events such as Sin­gles’ Day and Black Fri­day, as well as mo­bile phone launches.</p>
    <p>Tak­ings at the till de­clined 1.9 per cent in Novem­ber last year, com­pared with the same month in 2019, a stark im­prove­ment from the re­vised 8.5 per cent year-onyear de­cline in Oc­to­ber, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Depart­ment of Statis­tics yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They also out­shone the me­dian fore­cast of an 8.1 per cent drop by econ­o­mists polled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeff Ng, se­nior trea­sury strate­gist at HL Bank, said the strong pick-up sig­nals a re­cov­ery in eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity. “This shows that more peo­ple are en­gag­ing in do­mes­tic tourism. It is also in line with re­cent news and anec­dotes of cer­tain tours and ho­tels be­ing fully booked.”</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan cau­tioned, how­ever, that while in­terim sup­port, such as Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers, may pro­vide short-term re­lief, it is un­likely to fully cush­ion the ab­sence of tourism-led de­mand from over­seas, and the out­look for re­tail sales con­tin­ues to be chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “The resur­gence of Covid-19 cases glob­ally, cou­pled with the new con­ta­gious strains, may mean that in­ter­na­tional travel could stay weak for a pro­longed pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles, re­tail sales fell 2.9 per cent in Novem­ber, com­pared with the 11 per cent plunge in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the pre­vi­ous month, sea­son­ally ad­justed re­tail sales rose by 7.3 per cent in Novem­ber, up from the 0.2 per cent growth in Oc­to­ber. Ex­clud­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles, they rose 9.8 per cent, com­pared with the 0.1 per cent rise in the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>On a year-on-year ba­sis, most re­tail in­dus­tries con­tin­ued to reg­is­ter de­clines in sales. The slump in tak­ings was led by food and al­co­hol, where sales fell by 37.3 per cent, fol­lowed by cos­met­ics, toi­letries and med­i­cal goods, which saw tak­ings drop by 27.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>But sales of com­puter and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment did well, with a rise of 29 per cent, re­vers­ing an 18.5 per cent de­cline in Oc­to­ber. Fur­ni­ture and house­hold equip­ment also saw higher sales, of 28.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, sales of food and bev­er­age (F&B) ser­vices fell 22.5 per cent on a year-on-year ba­sis. Food cater­ers again led the fall, with a plunge of 75.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>The to­tal sales value of food and bev­er­age ser­vices in Novem­ber was es­ti­mated at $705 mil­lion. Of this, on­line sales made up an es­ti­mated 19.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>The over­all es­ti­mated to­tal re­tail sales value was about $3.6 billion, of which on­line re­tail sales made up an es­ti­mated 14.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>This trend of ris­ing on­line sales is es­pe­cially ev­i­dent for com­puter and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment, where dig­i­tal tak­ings made up more than half of to­tal sales.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, said the tran­si­tion to phase three and lift­ing of curbs on so­cial gath­er­ings could in­cre­men­tally boost re­tail sales and F&B spend­ing in the com­ing months. “But this has to be bal­anced against po­ten­tial set­backs, look­ing at the more vir­u­lent Covid-19 strains in other parts of the world and the still soft do­mes­tic labour mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>She said re­tail sales are likely to re­turn to pos­i­tive year-on-year growth as early as next month, and fore­casts growth of around 12 to 13 per cent for the whole of this year.</p>
    <p>Sales of com­puter and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment did well, with a rise of 29 per cent, re­vers­ing an 18.5 per cent de­cline in Oc­to­ber.</p>
