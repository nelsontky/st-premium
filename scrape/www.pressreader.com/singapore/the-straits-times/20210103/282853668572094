    <p>MON­TE­V­IDEO • The Uruguayan Academy of Let­ters on Fri­day de­nounced a three-game ban given to Manch­ester United’s Edin­son Ca­vani, call­ing the sanc­tion for alleged racism an ex­am­ple of English foot­ball’s lack of “cul­tural and lin­guis­tic knowl­edge”.</p>
    <p>The Uruguayan used the word “negrito” (small black per­son) in an In­sta­gram post af­ter the side’s Premier League vic­tory over Southamp­ton on Nov 29, be­fore tak­ing it down and apol­o­gis­ing. He said it was in­tended as an ex­pres­sion of af­fec­tion to a friend.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (FA) said the com­ment was “im­proper and brought the game into dis­re­pute”, fined Ca­vani £100,000 (S$178,160) and or­dered him to com­plete “faceto-face ed­u­ca­tion” as part of his pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>The academy, an as­so­ci­a­tion ded­i­cated to pro­tect­ing and pro­mot­ing the Span­ish l an­guage used in Uruguay, said it “en­er­get­i­cally re­jected the sanc­tion”.</p>
    <p>“The English Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion has com­mit­ted a se­ri­ous in­jus­tice with the Uruguayan sports­man... and has shown its ig­no­rance and er­ror in rul­ing on the use of lan­guage, and in par­tic­u­lar Span­ish, with­out not­ing all its com­plex­i­ties and con­texts,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“In the con­text that it was writ­ten, the only value that can be given to negrito, is af­fec­tion­ately.</p>
    <p>“In the Span­ish of Uruguay, for ex­am­ple, in cou­ples or among friends, be­tween par­ents and chil­dren, one of­ten hears and reads expression­s such as... gordito (fatso), ne­gri, negrito.</p>
    <p>“In fact, a per­son so ad­dressed is not nec­es­sar­ily over­weight or dark-skinned.”</p>
    <p>In essence, the academy ex­plained that words re­fer­ring to skin colour, weight and other phys­i­cal char­ac­ter­is­tics are of­ten used among friends and re­la­tions in Latin Amer­ica, es­pe­cially in the diminu­tive.</p>
    <p>In that con­text they are expression­s of ten­der­ness and are of­ten used in­de­pen­dently of the sub­ject’s ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>United said Ca­vani, 33, chose not to con­test the charge out of re­spect for the FA and the “fight against racism in foot­ball”.</p>
    <p>“My heart is at peace be­cause I know that I al­ways ex­pressed my­self with af­fec­tion ac­cord­ing to my cul­ture and way of life,” he wrote on In­sta­gram.</p>
