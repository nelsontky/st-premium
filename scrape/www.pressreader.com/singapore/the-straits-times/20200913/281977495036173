    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The third-ranked Nelly Korda, chas­ing her first Ma­jor golf ti­tle, fired a five-un­der 67 to seize a two-stroke lead af­ter the sec­ond round of the LPGA ANA In­spi­ra­tion on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can stood on 11-un­der 133 af­ter 36 holes at Mis­sion Hills Coun­try Club in Rancho Mirage, Cal­i­for­nia, while South Korea’s Lee Mi-rim was sec­ond on 135 af­ter a bo­gey-free 65.</p>
    <p>Dane Nanna Mad­sen (69) and Amer­i­can Lexi Thomp­son (67) – the 2014 win­ner – were third on 137.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing in golf I feel like is all about con­fi­dence and mo­men­tum, so j ust hav­ing that con­fi­dence and be­liev­ing in your­self is def­i­nitely re­ally im­por­tant,” Korda said.</p>
    <p>The younger daugh­ter of for­mer Czech tennis star Petr Korda, the 1998 Aus­tralian Open cham­pion, be­gan on the back nine, birdy­ing the par-three 14th and 17th holes.</p>
    <p>She then birdied the first and made key par saves from 20 feet at the par-five sec­ond and 25 feet at the par-four third.</p>
    <p>“Def­i­nitely re­ally im­por­tant. I did not know what I was do­ing on those two holes. I was happy those two (par putts) went in.</p>
    <p>“Golf is all about mo­men­tum. When those roll in, it makes it a lot eas­ier.”</p>
    <p>Korda, who led by one af­ter 18 holes, rolled in a 10-foot down­hill putt to also birdie the par-three eighth in the desert heat.</p>
    <p>“Thank God for my putting to­day,” she said. “Just con­sis­tent play and hav­ing fun. We have a lot of fun on the golf course and try to keep it su­per light.”</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old won last year’s Women’s Aus­tralian Open and French Ladies Open while de­fend­ing her ti­tle at the LPGA Swing­ing Skirts Tai­wan event.</p>
    <p>A win to­day would be a first for the Korda fam­ily – older sis­ter Jes­sica also plays on the Tour but has yet to break her Ma­jor duck – and Thomp­son be­lieves Nelly is the player to beat.</p>
    <p>“She played re­ally well,” the world No. 12, who won the 2014 edi­tion here, said. “I’m just go­ing to try to play my own game out here this week­end and see how it goes.”</p>
