    <p>MONTEGUT-LAURAGAIS (France) • He may never have put on a space­suit or flown in a shut­tle, but that has not stopped French­man Michael Mois­se­eff from reach­ing for the stars.</p>
    <p>Af­ter years of ex­plor­ing and re­con­struct­ing the scents of planet Earth, the 66-year-old “aroma sculp­tor” set him­self a new goal – cap­tur­ing the smell of the moon.</p>
    <p>Mr Mois­se­eff, with his flo­ral shirt and a head of white hair tied up at the back, strad­dles the line be­tween artist and sci­en­tist as he moves pur­pose­fully around the thou­sands of vials that make up his lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>It is here that the trained ge­neti­cist ful­fils his life’s work of dis­sect­ing the mys­ter­ies of smell and pro­duc­ing all kinds of scents, fra­grances and em­a­na­tions from mol­e­cules.</p>
    <p>“To recre­ate the scent of un­der­growth, for ex­am­ple, you have to go there first,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Is there any moss? Lichen? Mois­ture? I take an in­ven­tory and bring my el­e­ments to­gether like a painter with his pal­ette of colours. Then, I work on the mea­sures of each to try as best I can to fi­nesse the scent.”</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, the Moon is not quite as ac­ces­si­ble as the un­der­growth and the Cite de l’Es­pace (Space City) in Toulouse “did not want to pay for the trip”, jokes Mr Mois­se­eff.</p>
    <p>The only way he could build a pic­ture of the scent in his nose – the key tool for his work – was to read up on de­scrip­tions made by var­i­ous as­tro­nauts who walked on the Moon, in par­tic­u­lar Amer­i­can as­tro­naut Neil Armstrong, the first man to do so in 1969.</p>
    <p>“Due to the lack of oxy­gen on the Moon, he (Armstrong) ob­vi­ously couldn’t smell any­thing, but once back in the mo­d­ule, the smell of dust cling­ing to his space­suit re­minded him of the burnt black pow­der of an old six-shooter,” he says.</p>
    <p>In or­der to re­pro­duce that smell, Mr Mois­se­eff chose to det­o­nate black pow­der in his saucepans.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sev­eral failed at­tempts – and a cou­ple of scares – he fi­nally suc­ceeded in “cap­tur­ing” a burnt de­posit.</p>
    <p>Then, once he had worked out what kind of smell he was look­ing for, the mod­ern-day al­chemist set to work find­ing the right notes to com­plete the scent.</p>
    <p>A blend of me­tal­lic, car­bon and sul­phur notes com­bined to ti­t­il­late the nos­trils and imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Mois­se­eff has of­ten been de­scribed as an “aroma sculp­tor” and he cer­tainly does not shy from link­ing his work to other cre­ative arts, with his nose his most im­por­tant in­stru­ment.</p>
    <p>“Smells are like in mu­sic, you have to do your scales all the time,” he says.</p>
    <p>This “sci­en­tific artist” even dis­plays his work in a va­ri­ety of ways that would not be un­fa­mil­iar to con­tem­po­rary artists.</p>
    <p>He has long been stag­ing in­stal­la­tions and fra­grant ex­pe­ri­ences in tele­phone booths, en­tire vil­lages or per­for­mance halls at the re­quest of mu­se­ums, as­so­ci­a­tions or com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Mr Mois­se­eff’s next chal­lenge takes him back to the Re­nais­sance as he at­tempts to re­con­struct the scent of the Mona Lisa, or at least her sur­round­ings.</p>
    <p>It will be “a metic­u­lous work of in­ves­ti­ga­tion and his­tor­i­cal re­search”, he says with some ex­cite­ment.</p>
    <p>If he suc­ceeds, per­haps Mr Mois­se­eff will fi­nally un­cover the se­cret be­hind that most fa­mous of enig­matic smiles.</p>
