    <p>In­dia’s big­gest on­line gro­cer BigBas­ket has suf­fered an al­leged data breach that could have led to per­sonal in­for­ma­tion of more than 20 mil­lion users be­ing of­fered for sale on the Dark Web.</p>
    <p>This in­ci­dent fol­lows a se­ries of data breaches that have af­fected In­dian com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The Atlanta-based cy­ber se­cu­rity firm Cy­ble made the breach pub­lic on Nov 7, after find­ing the data for sale on­line for US$40,000 (S$53,650).</p>
    <p>It said it de­tected the al­leged breach on Oct 30, as part of its rou­tine mon­i­tor­ing of cy­ber crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity, and re­ported it to BigBas­ket on Nov 1.</p>
    <p>“The size of the SQL (do­main­spe­cific lan­guage) file is (around) 15GB, con­tain­ing close to 20 mil­lion user data,” ac­cord­ing to Cy­ble.</p>
    <p>“More specif­i­cally, this in­cludes full names, e-mail IDs, pass­word hashes (po­ten­tially hashed OTPs), PIN, con­tact numbers (mo­bile plus phone), full ad­dresses, date of birth, lo­ca­tion, and IP ad­dresses of lo­gin, among many oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>BigBas­ket has filed a com­plaint with the Cy­ber Crime Cell in Ban­ga­lore to in­ves­ti­gate if there is a data breach.</p>
    <p>The nine-year-old e-com­merce plat­form, which has op­er­a­tions in 35 cities across In­dia, is run by the Ban­ga­lore-based In­no­va­tive Re­tail Con­cepts, and is val­ued at US$2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is backed by, among oth­ers, Alibaba Group, Mi­rae As­set-Naver Asia Growth Fund and the Bri­tish gov­ern­men­towned CDC group.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, BigBas­ket said it was eval­u­at­ing the ex­tent of the breach and au­then­tic­ity of the claim with cy­ber se­cu­rity ex­perts and find­ing “im­me­di­ate ways to con­tain it”.</p>
    <p>Its co-founder Hari Menon said there was no change in cus­tomer be­hav­iour at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“The ex­tent of the breach is still un­known and un­clear and our cus­tomers know that. What we are cer­tain of is that there is no breach of any fi­nan­cial data what­so­ever be­cause we don’t store any fi­nan­cial data of our cus­tomers,” he added.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple started shop­ping for gro­ceries on­line after In­dia im­posed a lock­down in late March to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus. BigBas­ket saw its sales dou­ble from Fe­bru­ary to July, with its cus­tomer base grow­ing by 80 per cent and ex­ist­ing cus­tomers buy­ing 25 per cent more.</p>
    <p>The Data Se­cu­rity Coun­cil of In­dia, in part­ner­ship with Pay­Pal, said in an Au­gust re­port that the num­ber of peo­ple shop­ping on­line in In­dia grew 73 per cent in big cities and 400 per cent in smaller towns. But this had also given rise to scams re­lated to Covid-19 such as Web-skim­ming, mal­ware at­tack cam­paigns and phish­ing scams, the re­port noted.</p>
    <p>In June, de­liv­ery start-up Dunzo, also based in Ban­ga­lore, found that per­sonal de­tails of more than 300,000 of its user ac­counts had been leaked.</p>
    <p>Cy­ble alone re­ported six breaches in­volv­ing In­dian firms in the past month, in­clud­ing at snack maker Haldiram’s, mat­ri­mo­ni­alser­vice web­site BharatMat­ri­mony.com and the In­dian Rail­ways’ on­line tick­et­ing por­tal.</p>
    <p>Even as user data on­line be­comes more vo­lu­mi­nous and more vul­ner­a­ble, In­dia con­tin­ues to drag its feet on pass­ing a data pro­tec­tion pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Co­or­di­na­tor Ra­jesh Pant told The Eco­nomic Times: “The dig­i­tal ex­plo­sion that was sup­posed to hap­pen in five years sud­denly hap­pened in five weeks.</p>
    <p>“This dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion also re­quires fraud and risk man­age­ment.”</p>
