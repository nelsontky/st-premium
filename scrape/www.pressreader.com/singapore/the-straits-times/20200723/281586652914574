    <p>A $45 mil­lion cam­paign will be rolled out to drive lo­cal spend­ing in Sin­ga­pore’s eater­ies, shops and leisure at­trac­tions, which are reel­ing from a tourist drought caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic. The nine-month cam­paign aims to give life­style and tourism busi­nesses a boost after months of slow de­mand.</p>
    <p>A $45 mil­lion cam­paign will be rolled out to drive lo­cal spend­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s eater­ies, shops and leisure at­trac­tions, which are reel­ing from a tourist drought caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The nine-month Sin­gapoRedis-cov­ers cam­paign by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion aims to give life­style and tourism busi­nesses a much-needed boost after months of nearly non-ex­is­tent de­mand.</p>
    <p>In store are pack­ages and deals for lo­cals, heart­land tours and the pro­mo­tion of precincts as mini-hol­i­day des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the cam­paign launch yesterday, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said it is part of a broader medium-term plan to get Sin­ga­pore’s tourism in­dus­try to rein­vent and re­design its of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>He noted that the de­mand for mass mar­ket tourism is un­likely to re­cover in the near term un­less a vac­cine is made avail­able, and the global en­vi­ron­ment could re­main volatile as coun­tries are hit with re­cur­ring waves of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the vir­tual dia­logue Mr Chan had with in­dus­try mem­bers, ques­tions largely cen­tred on Sin­ga­pore’s ban on short-term vis­i­tors. He said es­sen­tial busi­ness travel will re­sume first through more green lane ar­range­ments with other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Small groups, like per­form­ers, could also be al­lowed in for events, which may soon be al­lowed to re­sume with a limit of 50 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket will grad­u­ally re­sume with higher-qual­ity trav­ellers first, he said. “It will be a niche mar­ket game and not a mass mar­ket game.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides re­think­ing its prod­ucts to tap de­mand for qual­ity niche mar­ket ser­vices, the tourism in­dus­try will also likely have to de­velop an end-to-end suite of ser­vices for trav­ellers, Mr Chan added.</p>
    <p>“Our model of pro­vid­ing a tourism prod­uct will have to be end-to-end, start­ing from be­fore, dur­ing and after the so-called con­sump­tion of the prod­uct in Sin­ga­pore,” he said. This in­cludes cater­ing for how trav­ellers move around and en­sur­ing their safety here.</p>
    <p>Out­lin­ing how he sees the in­dus­try evolv­ing, he said the Gov­ern­ment’s pri­or­ity in the near term is to save as many jobs as pos­si­ble and help work­ers who have lost their jobs. In the medium term, busi­nesses have to de­velop prod­ucts to cater to niche busi­ness trav­ellers as well as lo­cals, he said.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter cited plans to rein­vent the Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions) events model by us­ing technology to host large-scale events. Two con­fer­ences tak­ing place later this year will have up to 50 on-site at­ten­dees and an ex­pected 1,000 vir­tual at­ten­dees each.</p>
    <p>“If we can do this well in Sin­ga­pore, we will then show the way for the rest of the in­dus­try in other parts of the world to come to­gether to work with us as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also spoke of the need to reimag­ine tourism of­fer­ings to cap­ture more of the do­mes­tic mar­ket, and set new health and ser­vice stan­dards to build on the coun­try’s rep­u­ta­tion as a safe and trusted hub.</p>
    <p>In the long term, Sin­ga­pore re­mains com­mit­ted to ex­e­cut­ing plans like the re­de­vel­op­ment of the Sin­ga­pore Race­course in Kranji into a leisure des­ti­na­tion that will com­ple­ment na­ture-based at­trac­tions in the Mandai area, he said.</p>
    <p>STB chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan noted that more job losses are in­evitable in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>With leisure travel not ex­pected to re­turn sub­stan­tially any time soon, tourism busi­nesses must tap do­mes­tic de­mand – a chal­leng­ing propo­si­tion in the cur­rent cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing lo­cals to help make the cam­paign a suc­cess, Mr Tan said: “There’s a lot that we love about Sin­ga­pore that I sus­pect Sin­ga­pore­ans take for granted – your favourite chicken rice shop, your favourite mall in Or­chard Road, your favourite at­trac­tion... Th­ese will dis­ap­pear if Sin­ga­pore­ans don’t step up to sup­port th­ese busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>Din­ing and stay­ca­tion deals are among the 80 pro­mo­tions that have been cre­ated for lo­cal res­i­dents on the new Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers mi­crosite, with more to be added over the next nine months.</p>
    <p>Precincts such as Chi­na­town and Lit­tle India will also be mar­keted as des­ti­na­tions for lo­cals to re­dis­cover, with walk­ing tours and neigh­bour­hood guide­books that in­clude shop­ping and en­ter­tain­ment options in the area.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are among the plans for a $45 mil­lion cam­paign that was launched yesterday to help prop up tourism-de­pen­dent busi­nesses with lo­cal de­mand.</p>
    <p>Is­land ad­mis­sion to Sen­tosa will be waived un­til Sept 30, Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion (SDC) said in a joint state­ment with the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, the three agen­cies spear­head­ing the cam­paign to drive lo­cal spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Stay­ca­tion pack­ages with themed itin­er­ar­ies will be rolled out at the end of this month, SDC said. About 80 per cent of at­trac­tions and ho­tels on the is­land have re­opened thus far.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Food Fes­ti­val and Great Sin­ga­pore Sale will be go­ing dig­i­tal-only for the first time this year, with pro­mo­tions and vir­tual events.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral food and bev­er­age cam­paigns will also be launched in the com­ing months to sup­port eater­ies and bars, and drive pa­tron­age dur­ing off-peak times.</p>
    <p>STB’s mar­ket­ing blitz will in­clude tie-ups with travel book­ing plat­forms Ex­pe­dia and Klook, as well as in­ter­est groups and trade as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>There have been pre­vi­ous cam­paigns to boost do­mes­tic tourism, such as in the wake of the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome out­break in 2003.</p>
    <p>But the $45 mil­lion to be pooled by the three agen­cies for Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers’ var­i­ous mar­ket­ing ini­tia­tives is the most spent on a do­mes­tic cam­paign to date.</p>
    <p>The amount also rep­re­sents a “size­able por­tion” of what the STB spends on in­ter­na­tional mar­ket­ing on an av­er­age year, its chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan said.</p>
    <p>It is ap­pro­pri­ate as the cur­rent cri­sis will re­quire a long-drawnout ef­fort to avoid “cat­a­strophic” job losses and push the sec­tor to­wards re­cov­ery, he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans spent over $34 bil­lion on over­seas travel in 2018, and the goal is to chan­nel a sliver of their un­used travel bud­get for this year to lo­cal busi­nesses, Mr Tan said ahead of the cam­paign launch.</p>
    <p>“So, the amount of money that you would spend over­seas on a hol­i­day, say, year end you go to Ja­pan or Thai­land or Tai­wan, spend a frac­tion of that here in Sin­ga­pore in­stead,” he urged.</p>
