    <p>For eight years, Mr Ab­dul Hamid Ab­dul Ghani worked as a pas­sen­ger ser­vice as­so­ciate at Changi Air­port, where he checked in pas­sen­gers and scanned their passes and pass­ports be­fore they boarded their flights.</p>
    <p>But work ground to a halt at the end of March, when global air travel was crip­pled by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, his em­ployer, lo­gis­tics firm UBTS, man­aged to place him and 32 other air­port work­ers on sec­ond­ment to var­i­ous com­pa­nies ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Hamid, 59, is one of eight work­ers sec­onded to Hope Tech­nik where they as­sem­ble the en­gi­neer­ing firm’s tem­per­a­ture as­sess­ment sys­tems – which are used for tem­per­a­ture screen­ing in pub­lic places – and carry out qual­ity con­trol checks. He has been with the com­pany for about five months.</p>
    <p>The job is vastly dif­fer­ent from his pre­vi­ous role, but Mr Hamid is not com­plain­ing.</p>
    <p>“I felt re­lieved that I was able to start work again, even though I was a bit ap­pre­hen­sive at first.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, I was thank­ful for the op­por­tu­nity and thought it would be good ex­po­sure for me and my col­leagues,” he shared.</p>
    <p>Mr Hamid, who is mar­ried with three daugh­ters, was guided by other col­leagues on the steps to as­sem­ble the sys­tems as part of his on-the-job train­ing.</p>
    <p>His con­tract with Hope Tech­nik will end in the mid­dle of next month, but UBTS is try­ing to se­cure other ex­ter­nal sec­ond­ments for him and his col­leagues. “I think it is a great ar­range­ment for us,” he said. “Not only does it al­low us to earn some in­come, but we are also given the chance to try out new things, all while wait­ing for ev­ery­thing to go back to be­fore.” Calvin Yang</p>
