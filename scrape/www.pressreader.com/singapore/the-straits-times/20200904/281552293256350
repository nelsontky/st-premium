    <p>Marathoner Ashley Liew said, in Day 3 of his defama­tion suit against for­mer team­mate Soh Rui Yong, that the lat­ter’s nu­mer­ous com­ments and blog posts dis­put­ing his act of sports­man­ship at the 2015 SEA Games marathon had cast him in a very neg­a­tive light. As a “last resort”, Mr Liew had sent a le­gal letter to Mr Soh in July last year.</p>
    <p>Marathoner Ashley Liew said that his for­mer team­mate Soh Rui Yong’s “nu­mer­ous com­ments, blog posts” dis­put­ing the for­mer’s act of sports­man­ship at the 2015 SEA Games marathon had cast him in a “very neg­a­tive light”, prompt­ing him to send a le­gal letter to Soh in July last year as a “last resort”.</p>
    <p>Soh had in Oc­to­ber 2018 ac­cused Liew of ly­ing about the in­ci­dent that oc­curred at the marathon, where the lat­ter said he had slowed down to al­low other run­ners to catch up af­ter they missed a U-turn and took the wrong path. His ac­tions sub­se­quently earned him two sports­man­ship awards.</p>
    <p>Back in court for the third day of his defama­tion suit against Soh, Liew said yes­ter­day that he had ini­tially de­cided to let the lat­ter’s al­le­ga­tions slide when they first sur­faced in Soh’s blog post on June 22, 2015. The two-time SEA Games marathon cham­pion had then writ­ten that “No­body slowed down to wait – the race was on”.</p>
    <p>Soh’s lawyer, Clarence Lun from Fox­wood LLC, who noted that Liew had on Tues­day said that Soh’s al­le­ga­tions were un­pro­voked, said: “It’s not a be­lated at­tempt where in 2018 he came out to at­tack you... it was al­ready con­tem­po­ra­ne­ous in his blog post.”</p>
    <p>Liew, who is rep­re­sented by Mark Teng of That.Le­gal LLC, replied: “It’s un­pro­voked be­cause I had let this slide. I de­cided to let this slide out of grace and out of try­ing to be the bet­ter man. I’m not con­fronta­tional and if (Soh) chose to put it on his blog post it did up­set me, but I didn’t think too much about it at that point in time.”</p>
    <p>Lun then ques­tioned why Liew</p>
    <p>said in a le­gal re­ply to Soh last July that he “never stated or claimed or other­wise rep­re­sented” that his act “could have cost him a medal”. This was re­ported by The Straits Times then.</p>
    <p>Liew replied that the posts had cast him in a neg­a­tive light, adding that from his un­der­stand­ing of Soh, he shares some of the facts on so­cial me­dia but “maybe not all of it”.</p>
    <p>“I felt hurt, I felt that fi­nally it was time as a last resort to send a le­gal letter and (make) a clar­i­fi­ca­tion in The Straits Times. This was not some­thing I wanted to do. I got mar­ried on Aug 3 last year and I can­not tell you how much stress that caused me and my wife dur­ing that pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Grilling Liew on the awards, Lun said “the whole of Sin­ga­pore” knows of him be­cause of the awards he won, to which the for­mer dis­agreed, twice.</p>
    <p>Lun added: “You’re say­ing you’re fa­mous be­fore this award.”</p>
    <p>Liew replied: “No, that’s not what I’m say­ing... I hope I’m re­mem­bered not just for my awards, be­cause awards are not some­thing that de­fine me.”</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues next Tues­day, with Cam­bo­dia’s Ku­ni­aki Tak­izaki – Liew’s wit­ness who was one of the run­ners who com­peted in the marathon – ex­pected to tes­tify via video.</p>
    <p>Soh is also ex­pected to give his tes­ti­mony in court next week.</p>
