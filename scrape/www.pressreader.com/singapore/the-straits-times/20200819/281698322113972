    <p>Hos­pi­tals in Manila re­main over­whelmed and health work­ers are still over­worked two weeks after a strict coro­n­avirus lockdown, but a “re­boot” of the of­fi­cial re­sponse should see in­fec­tions plateau­ing or even go­ing down, the gov­ern­ment and health ex­perts said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Start­ing to­day, shut­down re­stric­tions that had been in place in Metro Manila and four nearby prov­inces since Aug 4 will be eased.</p>
    <p>The curbs are be­ing lifted, even though na­tion­wide in­fec­tions con­tinue to top 3,000 a day, and more than 500 peo­ple are re­ported to have died this month alone.</p>
    <p>That is one-fifth of the to­tal death toll.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said yes­ter­day that i nfec­tions had neared 170,000, with 4,836 new cases. More than 2,680 peo­ple have died.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines cur­rently has the most num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“Right now, we’re still re­ceiv­ing so many re­ports about how over­whelm­ing the wait­ing time is at emer­gency de­part­ments, that (the de­part­ments) are filled to the brim and can no longer ad­mit pa­tients,” said Dr Pauline Convocar, pres­i­dent of the Philip­pine Col­lege of Emer­gency Medicine.</p>
    <p>Four out of every five hos­pi­tal beds for Covid-19 pa­tients in the cap­i­tal are al­ready oc­cu­pied, ac­cord­ing to the Health Min­istry’s daily bul­letin.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte reim­posed quar­an­tine mea­sures early this month in Manila and four nearby prov­inces – home to about 27 mil­lion or one-quar­ter of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion – after more than 160 med­i­cal groups said the health sys­tem was on the verge of col­lapse.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines went through one of the long­est shel­ter-at-home re­stric­tions in the world, from midMarch to May.</p>
    <p>But since emerg­ing from the lockdown on June 1, con­firmed in­fec­tions in the ar­chi­pel­ago had in­creased more than five­fold and surged past 160,000.</p>
    <p>That made the Philip­pines the epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic in South­east Asia, dis­lodg­ing In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Dr Anna Lisa Lim, an in­fec­tious and trop­i­cal dis­eases spe­cial­ist at the Philip­pine Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, said the re­cent two-week lockdown prob­a­bly slowed the spread of the virus and gave hos­pi­tals a “time­out”.</p>
    <p>But that was not the main goal, she added.</p>
    <p>“The more im­por­tant, pri­mary goal was to re­group and try to see whether there was a more con­crete re­sponse to symp­toms of an over­whelmed sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“That was achieved to a cer­tain ex­tent. It opened up a di­a­logue,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that this led to a “re­boot” in the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse.</p>
    <p>This “re­freshed ap­proach” will see the gov­ern­ment shoring up its grass­roots re­sponse, so that those who fall sick do not re­act by go­ing straight to hos­pi­tal for treat­ment, she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque told reporters ear­lier that the gov­ern­ment will em­ploy pooled test­ing, and that con­tact trac­ers will make house calls, so that more asymp­to­matic cases can be found in com­mu­ni­ties and work­places, where most clus­ters of in­fected cases are sur­fac­ing.</p>
    <p>More com­mu­nity treat­ment and iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties will be built, so that may­ors and other grass­roots lead­ers can re­spond more ef­fec­tively as test­ing un­cov­ers out­breaks in their ar­eas, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Roque said busi­nesses al­lowed to re­open will also be held to higher health stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Guido David, who heads a Univer­sity of the Philip­pines’ re­search team that tracks Covid-19 statis­tics, said that if the gov­ern­ment fol­lows up on the changes in its pan­demic re­sponse, the Philip­pines could soon see a “flat­ten­ing” of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>He also said the R-naught, which de­scribes the virus’ in­fec­tion rate, had fallen from 1.5 last month to just 1.1 this month. If it falls be­low 1, “that means we’ve flat­tened the curve”, he added.</p>
    <p>But Dr Ben­jamin Co, an in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist, said the Rnaught alone could not be used as a met­ric.</p>
    <p>Apart from keep­ing it be­low 1, cases should also drop to just 200 a day from a cur­rent av­er­age of more than 3,000, and the pro­por­tion of those test­ing pos­i­tive should slide to 5 per cent, he added.</p>
    <p>“Only when we achieve those and sus­tain it for at least 14 days can we call it a vic­tory,” he said.</p>
    <p>HOS­PI­TALS OVER­WHELMED</p>
    <p>Right now, we’re still re­ceiv­ing so many re­ports about how over­whelm­ing the wait­ing time is at emer­gency de­part­ments, that (the de­part­ments) are filled to the brim and can no longer ad­mit pa­tients.</p>
