    <p>One neg­a­tive thing about get­ting to 1,000 – is that you’re very old as it means you have to have had a very long ca­reer. But I’m very happy.</p>
    <p>RAFAEL NADAL, 34, on his longevity in tennis.</p>
    <p>PARIS Rafael Nadal said he was proud of a “great achieve­ment” af­ter se­cur­ing the 1,000th ATP Tour-level vic­tory of his il­lus­tri­ous ca­reer on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard be­came the fourth man to reach that mark with a come­back win over Feli­ciano Lopez in the sec­ond round of the Paris Masters.</p>
    <p>The 20-time Grand Slam cham­pion, back in the French cap­i­tal less than a month af­ter win­ning his 13th Roland Gar­ros ti­tle, edged out his com­pa­triot 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.</p>
    <p>“I am proud about a lot of things, but I faced some chal­lenges in my ca­reer in terms of body in­juries,” said Nadal.</p>
    <p>“But I al­ways had the pas­sion to keep go­ing and the hu­mil­ity to keep go­ing when things are go­ing in a way you don’t ex­pect. It’s a great achieve­ment for me.”</p>
    <p>The world No. 2, whose first match win on the Tour came in April 2002 when he was just 15, is fourth on the all-time list, with Jimmy Con­nors lead­ing the way on 1,274 vic­to­ries, 32 more than sec­ond-placed Roger Fed­erer.</p>
    <p>“One neg­a­tive thing about get­ting to 1,000 – is that you’re very old as it means you have to have had a very long ca­reer,” added Nadal, who is 68 wins be­hind Ivan Lendl in third. “But I’m very happy.”</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old was given a spe­cial pre­sen­ta­tion to cel­e­brate his achieve­ment af­ter the match in an empty Bercy Arena.</p>
    <p>The event was be­ing played be­hind closed doors af­ter France en­tered its sec­ond coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing the tro­phy in Paris for the first time this week­end will see Nadal equal world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic’s record of 36 Masters ti­tles.</p>
    <p>He is play­ing the Paris Masters for the eighth time and his best per­for­mance at Bercy re­mains his run to the 2007 fi­nal where he lost to David Nal­ban­dian.</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s last-16 match, Diego Schwartz­man of Ar­gentina moved within one win of qual­i­fy­ing for the Nov 15-22 sea­son-end­ing ATP Tour Fi­nals with a 6-1, 6-1 vic­tory over Spa­niard Ale­jan­dro Davi­dovich Fok­ina.</p>
