    <p>The crack­down on the cross-bor­der trans­ac­tions has fi­nally rammed home the in­con­ve­nient fact that Ma­cau has al­ways been de­pen­dent on out­flow of funds from the main­land.</p>
    <p>MR BEN LEE, founder of IGamiX, on Bei­jing iden­ti­fy­ing the cross-bor­der flow of funds for gam­bling as a national se­cu­rity risk.</p>
    <p>Fears that China is broad­en­ing a crack­down on off­shore gam­bling have sparked a rush to with­draw bil­lions of dol­lars from the world’s big­gest casino hub, Ma­cau, threat­en­ing a re­cov­ery in the coro­n­avirus-stricken econ­omy, ex­ec­u­tives say.</p>
    <p>An un­prece­dented stam­pede to with­draw money from jun­kets – or­gan­ised by com­pa­nies that l ure high rollers to gam­ble – started in July af­ter Bei­jing i den­ti­fied the cross-bor­der flow of funds for gam­bling as a national se­cu­rity risk.</p>
    <p>Wor­ry­ingly, the cus­tomer with­drawals have spilled into the broader casino in­dus­try, lead­ing to a cash crunch in Ma­cau’s VIP sec­tor at a time when the Chi­nese ter­ri­tory is strug­gling to re­cover from Covid-19 re­stric­tions that have sent tourist num­bers and gam­bling rev­enues plum­met­ing.</p>
    <p>“This is not mil­lions we are talk­ing about be­ing taken out here, but bil­lions,” said a casino ex­ec­u­tive who was not autho­rised to speak to the me­dia. “We have cash in the bank, but with ev­ery­one with­draw­ing, it’s a prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other ex­ec­u­tives also told Reuters cash was be­ing taken out in the bil­lions of Hong Kong dol­lars.</p>
    <p>While Ma­cau casi­nos have am­ple re­serves to ride out sev­eral months of zero rev­enues, the ris­ing cash with­drawals point to a ma­jor loss of con­fi­dence in the cru­cial VIP jun­ket sec­tor, in a fur­ther blow to the econ­omy, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor ac­counts for about 50 per cent of over­all gam­bling rev­enues, which hit US$36.5 bil­lion (S$49.8 bil­lion) last year. The pan­demic has al­ready rav­aged the econ­omy, with gam­bling rev­enues down about 96 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter year on year.</p>
    <p>The with­drawals be­gan when hun­dreds of cus­tomers tried to pull de­posits from top jun­ket op­er­a­tor Suncity’s VIP clubs across Ma­cau, over fears it was be­ing tar­geted by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties. Suncity de­nied the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The group then be­gan re­strict­ing with­drawals, spark­ing a rush by cus­tomers seek­ing to pull their money from all jun­kets, ex­ec­u­tives said.</p>
    <p>Suncity said it was act­ing in com­pli­ance with new casino poli­cies, but de­clined to elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>Jun­ket op­er­a­tors in the former Por­tuguese colony are li­censed to pro­vide cus­tomers with chip de­posits and with­drawal ser­vices on be­half of casi­nos Sands China, Wynn Ma­cau,</p>
    <p>MGM China, Galaxy Entertainm­ent, SJM Hold­ings and Melco Re­sorts. All the casi­nos de­clined Reuters’ re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>As cus­tomers started pulling out money amid fears of a broader crack­down by Bei­jing, jun­ket agents in turn have be­gun tak­ing back de­posits from the casi­nos.</p>
    <p>Casi­nos have re­acted by put­ting lim­its on cash chip with­drawals, ex­ec­u­tives said.</p>
    <p>“The crack­down on the cross-bor­der trans­ac­tions has fi­nally rammed home the in­con­ve­nient fact that Ma­cau has al­ways been de­pen­dent on out­flow of funds from the main­land,” said Mr Ben Lee, founder of Ma­cau gam­ing con­sul­tancy IGamiX.</p>
    <p>Gam­bling is il­le­gal on the main­land, but is al­lowed in casi­nos in Ma­cau. In some casi­nos, cus­tomers can now with­draw only HK$1 mil­lion (S$176,000), com­pared with HK$5 mil­lion in re­cent months, and only the ac­count holder can make a with­drawal, say ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>Any trans­ac­tion over HK$200,000 is now flagged, lead­ing to peo­ple car­ry­ing around HK$5 mil­lion in chips in mul­ti­ple sets of HK$10,000 to avoid de­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>With thou­sands cash­ing out chips, some cash ma­chines and ex­change desks around Ma­cau have briefly shown lim­ited or no avail­abil­ity in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Ma­cau’s mon­e­tary au­thor­ity told Reuters the sup­ply of Hong Kong dol­lars is cur­rently stable and that it has taken mea­sures to en­sure the ad­e­quate sup­ply of cur­rency.</p>
    <p>The with­drawals come as China fully re­sumed Ma­cau tourist visas from yes­ter­day, and ex­ec­u­tives warn that more ar­rivals could mean more cash be­ing pulled out.</p>
    <p>Some Suncity cus­tomers, an­gry at not be­ing able to get their funds, have started an on­line group called Suncity Vic­tims and were plan­ning a protest yes­ter­day at VIP rooms across Ma­cau.</p>
