    <p>Malaysia’s for­mer two-time prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad is co­op­er­at­ing with his for­mer ri­val of 30 years, Umno law­maker Raza­leigh Hamzah, ahead of a cru­cial vote on the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment’s 2021 bud­get to­day.</p>
    <p>In a press con­fer­ence yesterday, Tun Dr Ma­hathir and Tengku Raza­leigh, the most se­nior MP from gov­ern­ment party Umno, said that they are will­ing to “con­trib­ute” their ex­per­tise to de­vel­op­ing Malaysia should the bud­get fail at its fi­nal com­mit­tee stage vot­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>But the two states­men stopped short of say­ing that they are look­ing to se­cure a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity to form the next Malaysian gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In an un­usual sight in Malaysian pol­i­tics, they sat side by side at the joint news con­fer­ence in Dr Ma­hathir’s of­fice in Kuala Lumpur, bury­ing three decades of po­lit­i­cal en­mity. It came just weeks af­ter pic­tures emerged of a meet­ing be­tween the two men, lead­ing to spec­u­la­tion that they would team up against Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>The Muhyid­din-led PN ad­min­is­tra­tion has only a sin­gle-digit ma­jor­ity in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Tengku Raza­leigh, who had been an out­spo­ken critic of Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, yesterday la­belled the gov­ern­ment as “il­le­git­i­mate”, the clear­est in­di­ca­tion that he is break­ing ranks with his party.</p>
    <p>Umno con­trib­utes the big­gest bloc of MPs to the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Tengku Raza­leigh, 83, served in Dr Ma­hathir’s Cab­i­net twice dur­ing the 1980s, but the two men be­came bit­ter ri­vals from 1987, when the for­mer chal­lenged the lat­ter for the Umno presidency.</p>
    <p>Tengku Raza­leigh went on to form his own party, Se­man­gat 46, be­fore re­join­ing Umno in 1996.</p>
    <p>He is cur­rently on his ninth con­sec­u­tive term as the MP of Gua Mu­sang in Ke­lan­tan. He is also chair­man of Umno’s board of ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir, 95, said: “We are two old men. There is no need to pay us a salary even. We just want to con­trib­ute based on our ex­pe­ri­ence and our know-how.”</p>
    <p>He said their com­bined ex­pe­ri­ence could help re­store Malaysia’s eco­nomic rep­u­ta­tion as a “tiger” econ­omy, as it was called in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time that Dr Ma­hathir, who was prime min­is­ter for 22 years dur­ing his first term, had joined forces with long­stand</p>
    <p>ing po­lit­i­cal ri­vals.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the for­mer premier set aside dif­fer­ences with op­po­si­tion lead­ers Lim Kit Siang and An­war Ibrahim to form the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) op­po­si­tion coali­tion, which went on to win fed­eral power in 2018.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir was prime min­is­ter for 22 months in his sec­ond term be­fore his party at the time, Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu), left PH.</p>
    <p>This led Ber­satu’s pres­i­dent, Mr</p>
    <p>Muhyid­din, 73, to form a new po­lit­i­cal al­liance by team­ing up with Umno, Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia and a coali­tion of par­ties from Sarawak.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s first fed­eral bud­get, which was un­veiled on Nov 6, had al­ready been passed at pol­icy stage and sev­eral com­mit­tee stage lev­els in Par­lia­ment. The bud­get will be up for its fi­nal vote to­day.</p>
    <p>The three-party PH, in a state­ment yesterday, said it will vote down the bud­get be­cause the Bill</p>
    <p>“had not met its ob­jec­tives”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, any at­tempt to de­feat Mr Muhyid­din’s bud­get would likely hinge on Dr Ma­hathir work­ing with Datuk Seri An­war, 73, who leads the PH coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war, who is no longer work­ing with Dr Ma­hathir fol­low­ing the lat­ter’s de­par­ture from PH, has so far failed to show proof to back his claim that he has se­cured enough MPs to top­ple the PN gov­ern­ment.</p>
