    <p>Three more peo­ple have died of dengue fever, bring­ing the to­tal for the year to 19 deaths as Sin­ga­pore ex­pe­ri­ences an out­break that is un­prece­dented here.</p>
    <p>Those who died were 49 to 92 years of age. Of them, 17 were work­ing or liv­ing in a dengue clus­ter. Last year, a to­tal of 20 peo­ple died of dengue.</p>
    <p>There are now 413 ac­tive dengue clus­ters con­cen­trated mostly in the east­ern part of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>This is the sixth con­sec­u­tive week with dengue in­fec­tions top­ping 1,000 cases. There were 1,736 in­fec­tions di­ag­nosed last week, 65 more than the pre­vi­ous week.</p>
    <p>Un­til this year, the high­est weekly in­fec­tion was 891 in 2014.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary, 18,673 peo­ple have been in­fected, a num­ber ex­ceeded only in 2013, when 22,170 peo­ple were in­fected in the en­tire year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health, 17 per cent, or more than 3,100 peo­ple, have been hos­pi­talised in pub­lic hos­pi­tals this year for dengue; and about 1 per cent of them were so sick they had to be ad­mit­ted to in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>In spite of ef­forts by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) to halt the spread of the mos­quito-borne dis­ease, the num­ber of ac­tive clus­ters con­tin­ues to in­crease.</p>
    <p>Of the 413 ac­tive clus­ters, 141 are clas­si­fied as high risk as they had 10 peo­ple or more in­fected within 150m of each other within a two week pe­riod.</p>
    <p>There are now 19 huge clus­ters with 100 peo­ple or more in­fected. The two big­gest, each with 260 cases, are in the Alju­nied-Gey­lang-Guille­mard area (147 breed­ing sites found) and the Bukit Pan­jang-Wood­lands area (51 breed­ing sites found).</p>
    <p>The sin­gle block with the most peo­ple in­fected is Block 608 at Senja Road with 33 cases. The third su­per clus­ter is in the Mount­bat­ten Road area with 234 peo­ple in­fected, and 73 breed­ing sites found.</p>
    <p>There has been only one other su­per clus­ter this year – at Woodleigh Close, where 218 peo­ple were in­fected. That clus­ter, which started on March 31 and was closed on July 6, had 81 breed­ing sites.</p>
    <p>The NEA said it con­ducted more than 454,000 in­spec­tions is­land­wide in the first six months and un­cov­ered about 11,700 mos­quito breed­ing habi­tats. It said in the months of May and June, it found 50 per cent more breed­ing i n homes and twice the num­ber in con­do­minium grounds, con­struc­tion sites, com­mon ar­eas and other places like schools. The in­crease could have been due to less main­te­nance car­ried out dur­ing the twom­onth-long cir­cuit breaker from April 7, as move­ment was re­stricted. There was also the dor­mi­tory out­break, re­duc­ing work­ers avail­able to do the tasks.</p>
    <p>NEA has taken ac­tion against the own­ers of over 2,000 premises for mos­quito breed­ing. The penalty has also been raised from last Wed­nes­day for those caught breed­ing mosquitoes. In­stead of a $200 fine for the first three in­fringe­ments, the fine for house­holds is now $300 if breed­ing is found af­ter they have been served no­tice that they are in a dengue clus­ter, or if more than one breed­ing spot is found.</p>
    <p>In the first half of the year, it acted against 1,020 res­i­den­tial prop­erty own­ers for the more than 6,000 breed­ing sites found.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion sites caught breed­ing mosquitoes are fined $3,000, up from $2,000, while town coun­cils are fined up to $5,000 for breed­ing found in com­mon ar­eas.</p>
    <p>NEA also took ac­tion against 140 con­struc­tion sites af­ter find­ing 470 breed­ing habi­tats; and took 530 en­force­ment ac­tions against town coun­cils for hav­ing 2,700 breed­ing spots. It has stepped up checks for mos­quito breed­ing this month with 2,500 i nspec­tions a week. The usual is about 1,500 in­spec­tions.</p>
    <p>It asks peo­ple to pro­tect them­selves against mos­quito bites to stop the trans­mis­sion chain.</p>
