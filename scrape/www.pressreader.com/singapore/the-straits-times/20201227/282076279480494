    <p>I watched in dis­may as air­port se­cu­rity tossed my tiny can­is­ter of pep­per spray into the trash.</p>
    <p>Although I had never needed to use it, the spray had been a valu­able ally through­out my col­lege ex­change se­mes­ter in Europe, when I dozed fit­fully on night buses and in hos­tel dor­mi­to­ries. But as I ap­proached the de­par­ture gate at Mu­nich air­port, there was a sense of relief too. Head­ing home to Sin­ga­pore, I was pos­i­tive I would not need pep­per spray in our rel­a­tively safer streets.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a spate of se­ri­ous sex­ual of­fences re­ported this year has led me to ques­tion the preva­lence of sex­ual as­sault out­side our homes in Sin­ga­pore and what can be done to tackle it.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, a doctor was ac­cused of in­sult­ing the mod­esty of hun­dreds of women at var­i­ous lo­ca­tions is­land­wide, al­legedly us­ing a GoPro cam­era at­tached to his shoe to record up­skirt videos.</p>
    <p>A male un­der­grad­u­ate who took up­skirt and up­shirt videos of 335 women over about six months was sen­tenced to nine months and three weeks’ jail in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>In a survey re­leased last year, con­sumer ad­vice group Value Cham­pi­ons ranked Sin­ga­pore and New Zealand the safest coun­tries in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion for women. The anal­y­sis of 14 coun­tries was based on safety, health­care and op­por­tu­ni­ties for women. While it com­mended both coun­tries, the study also high­lighted ar­eas for im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>It cited the 12 per cent hike in the ou­trage of mod­esty cases re­ported in Sin­ga­pore from 2017 to 2018, which in­di­cated that sex­ual ha­rass­ment is still a con­cern. As the survey pointed out, while Sin­ga­pore is safer than many other cities, low in­ci­dence does not mean no in­ci­dence.</p>
    <p>Sex­ual as­sault does hap­pen in our pub­lic spa­ces and its preva­lence is a mat­ter of con­cern for ev­ery­one. Of the women who shared their disturbing ex­pe­ri­ences with me, three said they had been ha­rassed on their pub­lic com­mutes.</p>
    <p>One woman I spoke to shared how she once sat op­po­site a man on an MRT train who kept star­ing at her body. When the seat next to her was va­cated, he went to sit next to her. Ter­ri­fied, she got off the train, even though it was not her sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Her ex­pe­ri­ence re­minded me of my own, alight­ing at a bus stop six blocks from my house in a fran­tic hurry af­ter the man I was stand­ing be­side brushed his hand against my thigh. Dur­ing the walk home, I won­dered if it had been a mis­taken touch on his part or whether I should have called him out.</p>
    <p>Other women who shared sto­ries of such en­coun­ters in li­braries or at entertainm­ent venues said they of­ten felt scared and wanted to re­move them­selves from the sit­u­a­tion quickly.</p>
    <p>Two other pub­lic spa­ces where sex­ual as­sault can take place are the work­place and on­line.</p>
    <p>Gen­der equal­ity ad­vo­cacy group Aware recorded that 131 out of 777 to­tal sex­ual vi­o­lence cases that have come to its Sex­ual As­sault Care Cen­tre last year were at the work­place. It also recorded that 140 out of the to­tal were tech­nol­ogy-fa­cil­i­tated sex­ual vi­o­lence cases, which in­clude up­skirt­ing and cy­ber ha­rass­ment. About 14 of these cases over­lapped be­tween the two do­mains.</p>
    <p>These anec­dotes show that sex­ual as­sault oc­curs in all types of pub­lic spa­ces, in­clud­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>Aware’s se­nior ex­ec­u­tive of work­place ha­rass­ment and dis­crim­i­na­tion ad­vi­sory Mamta Mel­wani said the psy­cho­log­i­cal ef­fects of sex­ual vi­o­lence can be short or long term, and can in­clude de­pres­sion, anx­i­ety, anger, flash­backs and de­nial.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of re­ported cases may also be just the tip of the ice­berg. Ms Mel­wani said seven in 10 clients at Aware’s Sex­ual</p>
    <p>As­sault Care Cen­tre do not file po­lice re­ports and the rea­son most fre­quently given for that is a fear of not be­ing be­lieved, or be­ing blamed for what hap­pened.</p>
    <p>The po­lice’s annual crime brief for last year listed a to­tal of 1,605 re­ported ou­trage of mod­esty cases in 2019, a de­crease from 1,728 cases from the year be­fore. This in­cluded the num­ber of re­ported cases in the pub­lic trans­port sys­tem and at entertainm­ent out­lets, both of which had de­creased com­pared to 2018.</p>
    <p>Some mea­sures that con­trib­uted to the drop could be stepped-up po­lice pa­trols and pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion videos and ad­vi­sories on the topic. The po­lice also worked with the Na­tional Crime Pre­ven­tion Coun­cil and the entertainm­ent in­dus­try to re­duce the in­ci­dence of ou­trage of mod­esty cases and other crimes.</p>
    <p>The brief stated that cases at shop­ping malls in­creased by 14.7 per cent to 125 in 2019, from 109 the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>The figures left me to pon­der what more we can do col­lec­tively as a so­ci­ety, be­yond en­force­ment and surveil­lance, so that the bur­den of “keep­ing safe” from sex­ual as­sault does not fall squarely on the shoul­ders of in­di­vid­ual women.</p>
    <p>One as­pect is the phys­i­cal space it­self. A video report by the BBC last year threw light on what a city would look like de­signed by women, with a fo­cus on Barcelona in Spain. The report looked into “anti-machismo stands” in the city, where women could seek in­for­ma­tion and ad­vice when vis­it­ing entertainm­ent out­lets at night. Women were also di­rected to a new ap­pli­ca­tion launched by the town hall where they could anony­mously report sex­ual ag­gres­sion they have wit­nessed or suf­fered, cre­at­ing a map of where sex­ual as­sault hap­pens. Could sim­i­lar ini­tia­tives be use­ful in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>An­other important fac­tor is the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>As a pri­mary school pupil, my friend Sh­eryl (not her real name) was once ap­proached by a stranger on her daily cy­cle com­mute to school. The woman be­gan talk­ing to her like they were ac­quain­tances at a traf­fic light stop. Sh­eryl was con­fused un­til the woman leaned over and whis­pered that a man had been fol­low­ing her on his bi­cy­cle for the past two streets. As soon as he saw the woman ap­proach Sh­eryl, the man turned his bi­cy­cle around.</p>
    <p>Her ex­pe­ri­ence, although har­row­ing, high­lights the dif­fer­ence vig­i­lant by­standers can make. If we stay less glued to our mo­bile de­vices and more aware of those around us while out and about, we might be able to re­act quickly and help some­one in need.</p>
    <p>While sex­ual as­sault in pub­lic spa­ces can­not be ex­pected to dis­ap­pear overnight, it mer­its a sus­tained dis­cus­sion and con­sis­tent com­mu­nity en­gage­ment to drive mean­ing­ful change one day at a time.</p>
    <p>Of the women who shared their disturbing ex­pe­ri­ences with me, three said they had been ha­rassed on their pub­lic com­mutes.</p>
