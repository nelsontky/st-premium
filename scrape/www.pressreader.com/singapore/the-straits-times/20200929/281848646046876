    <p>•</p>
    <p>BEI­JING China’s lead­ers are poised to en­dorse a lower eco­nomic growth tar­get for the coun­try’s next five-year plan com­pared with 2016-2020, as the au­thor­i­ties nav­i­gate grow­ing chal­lenges fu­elled by a deep­en­ing rift with the United States, pol­icy sources said.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and other lead­ers are ex­pected to dis­cuss and ap­prove China’s eco­nomic and so­cial devel­op­ment blue­print for 2021-2025 at a key Com­mu­nist Party con­clave next month, the sources told Reuters.</p>
    <p>State news agency Xin­hua said yes­ter­day that the meet­ing will be held from Oct 26-29.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers be­lieve that set­ting a five-year growth tar­get is vi­tal for steer­ing the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy past the “mid­dle-in­come trap”, the sources said, af­ter in­ter­nal de­bate over whether it should aban­don such tar­gets to en­able more flex­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The tar­get also keeps lo­cal gov­ern­ments fo­cused on devel­op­ment goals at a time of a deep­en­ing rift be­tween China and the US over a broad range of is­sues, they said.</p>
    <p>“There will be an eco­nomic tar­get. Where is the di­rec­tion of devel­op­ment if there is no such an­chor?” said one source who is in­volved in the de­bate.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment think-tanks and economists have made rec­om­men­da­tions for av­er­age an­nual gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) growth tar­gets in­clud­ing “around 5 per cent”, 5-5.5 per cent to 5-6 per cent, the sources said.</p>
    <p>China is tar­get­ing av­er­age an­nual growth of over 6.5 per cent for the 13th five-year plan that ends this year.</p>
    <p>China’s State Coun­cil In­for­ma­tion Of­fice did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Some gov­ern­ment ad­vis­ers have ar­gued that China should do away with of­fi­cial growth tar­gets – a le­gacy of decades of cen­tral eco­nomic plan­ning – to re­duce re­liance on debt-fu­elled stim­u­lus and en­cour­age more pro­duc­tive in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Re­form ad­vo­cates hope Pres­i­dent Xi’s pro­posed “dual cir­cu­la­tion” strat­egy, ex­pected to be the cen­tre­piece at the con­clave, will be an op­por­tu­nity to quicken re­forms to spur do­mes­tic de­mand and un­leash fresh growth en­gines.</p>
    <p>In May, China aban­doned its an­nual GDP growth tar­get, for 2020, for the first time in 18 years due to a heavy blow from the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, al­though some economists sus­pected the gov­ern­ment has main­tained an im­plicit goal of around 3 per cent.</p>
    <p>The five-year plan is ex­pected to be un­veiled at the an­nual Par­lia­ment meet­ing early next year. A growth tar­get for 2021 it­self, also to be un­veiled at the Par­lia­ment ses­sion, is likely to be set by top lead­ers at an an­nual eco­nomic con­fer­ence in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect the gov­ern­ment to ei­ther not set an ex­plicit growth tar­get or set a lower and more flex­i­ble (for ex­am­ple, around 5 per cent) growth tar­get” for 2021-2025, an­a­lysts at UBS said in a note to clients.</p>
    <p>China faces grow­ing head­winds to main­tain its as­cent as the US ratch­ets up pres­sure on trade, tech­nol­ogy and other fronts, threat­en­ing a de­cou­pling of the world’s two largest economies.</p>
    <p>An­nual growth of about 5 per cent would be enough for China to by­pass the “mid­dle-in­come trap” that has be­fallen coun­tries such as Ar­gentina, Brazil and South Africa, which have strug­gled to boost pro­duc­tiv­ity and shift to­wards higher value-added in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>The World Bank de­fines high-in­come coun­tries as those with per capita gross na­tional in­come of above US$12,535 (S$17,218). China’s per capita in­come reached US$10,410 in 2019, ac­cord­ing to the World Bank.</p>
    <p>The State Coun­cil’s Devel­op­ment Re­search Cen­tre, the Cab­i­net’s think-tank, said in a re­cent re­port that it ex­pects China to be­come a high-in­come na­tion by 2024 and over­take the US as the world’s largest econ­omy by 2032.</p>
