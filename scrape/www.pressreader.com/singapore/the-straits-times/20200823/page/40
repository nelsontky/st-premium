They can give more personal coaching to help the students improve their understand­ing and in doing so, boost their examinatio­n grades and even excel in a subject they once thought was impossible to do well in.

ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW Wholesome, comforting flavours JUSTIN CHUA The taste of home is what many of us yearn for when we spend extended amounts of time overseas. In fact, some of us go to exceptiona­l lengths to ensure we get our fix while outside these shores. For example, I know a guy who gets ready his stash of “chilli padi” every time he heads abroad. This may seem peculiar to some, but when you find yourself in a foreign land that does not share the same appreciati­on for spice as we do, you are going to lap it up!
Trust Niqqi’s to serve as your source of wholesome, comforting goodness. Their speciality Muslim dishes cater to all walks, whether you are after something spicy, or savoury. Plus, they are open 24/7 so there’s no reason not to pay them a visit!
