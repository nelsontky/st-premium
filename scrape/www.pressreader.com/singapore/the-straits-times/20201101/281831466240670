    <p>DES MOINES (Iowa) • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump stunned the po­lit­i­cal uni­verse in 2016 with a sweep of crit­i­cal north­ern swing states, win­ning Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin by less than 1 per­cent­age point and forc­ing Democrats into four years of soulsearch­ing about what went wrong in their his­toric ge­o­graphic base.</p>
    <p>Four years later, the chilly Midwest looms again as the main bat­tle­ground of the vote. On Fri­day, Mr Trump and his ri­val, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, criss­crossed the re­gion cam­paign­ing in states that are not only must-wins for the Pres­i­dent but also cen­tral to the iden­ti­ties of both par­ties.</p>
    <p>For Democrats, their blue wall in the Midwest was for years their only de­fence against the Repub­li­can Party’s strong­hold i n the South, a de­mon­stra­tion that they were still the party of labour, work­ing-class fam­i­lies and pre­dom­i­nantly black ur­ban cen­tres.</p>
    <p>For Repub­li­cans, th­ese states are a key part of their ru­ral base, and Mr Trump has made his pitch to farm­ers and white work­ing-class vot­ers here.</p>
    <p>As the coun­try re­ported a record num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases in the past week, Mr Trump con­tin­ued to in­sist on Fri­day that the dis­ease the virus causes was not se­ri­ous. At a rally in Michi­gan, a state that re­ported a 91 per cent in­crease in new Covid-19 cases from the av­er­age two weeks ear­lier, he made the ex­tra­or­di­nary and un­founded ac­cu­sa­tion that Amer­i­can doc­tors were prof­i­teer­ing from coro­n­avirus deaths, claim­ing they were paid more if pa­tients died.</p>
    <p>Later, in Min­nesota, Mr Bi­den lashed out at Mr Trump for his com­ments. He said: “Doc­tors and nurses go to work ev­ery day to save lives. They do their jobs. Don­ald Trump should stop at­tack­ing them and do his job.”</p>
    <p>Trail­ing in most opin­ion polls and with an in­creas­ingly nar­row path to vic­tory, Mr Trump had been forced to hold a se­ries of large ral­lies in states he can­not af­ford to lose, namely Michi­gan, Wis­con­sin and Min­nesota, on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“He’s sort of try­ing to re­peat the 2016 play­book,” said Pro­fes­sor Charles Franklin, di­rec­tor of the Mar­quette Law School poll.</p>
    <p>“He’s com­ing back to th­ese three states. He did that ef­fec­tively, sur­prised us all, and won with that strat­egy.”</p>
    <p>But this time, Mr Trump is trail­ing Mr Bi­den by 8 per­cent­age points in Michi­gan in a re­cent poll by The New York Times and Siena Col­lege, un­der­scor­ing his trou­bled stand­ing in Mid­west­ern bat­tle­ground states where his base of white vot­ers with­out col­lege de­grees ap­pears to be drift­ing away from him.</p>
    <p>In Wis­con­sin, an av­er­age of opin­ion polls shows Mr Bi­den with a 10-point lead.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign ad­vis­ers, while ex­press­ing con­fi­dence in the Pres­i­dent’s prospects, have pointed to a num­ber of out­side fac­tors that make this year more chal­leng­ing in north­ern battlegrou­nds.</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor­ships of Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin are all now held by what they called “anti-Trump Democrats”. Early vot­ing, they con­cede, is a ma­jor “X fac­tor” whose im­pact is not yet fully un­der­stood. And the pan</p>
    <p>demic re­mains a top con­cern for vot­ers, blunt­ing to an ex­tent the eco­nomic gains that Mr Trump had hoped to run on.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s Mid­west­ern swing on Fri­day in­cluded stops in Iowa, Min­nesota and Wis­con­sin, an itin­er­ary that showed both the prom­ise and peril for his cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Iowa dealt Mr Bi­den a “gut punch” early this year, as he later put it af­ter fin­ish­ing fourth in the state’s cau­cuses. The state voted twice for Mr Barack Obama. But it swung sharply to the right in 2016, when Mr Trump won by 9 per­cent­age points. Sur­veys have sug­gested a tight race in this elec­tion.</p>
    <p>On a bright au­tumn day, Mr Bi­den held a drive-in car rally at the Iowa State Fair­grounds in Des Moines, where sup­port­ers dec­o­rated their cars with Bi­den signs and honked to show their sup­port.</p>
    <p>One of them was Ms Linda Gar­ling­house, 69, who said she was hop­ing for a big win by Mr Bi­den. “I’m just hop­ing for a land­slide,” she said, so there will not be “any doubt cast on the elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>TRY­ING WHAT WORKED BE­FORE</p>
    <p>He’s sort of try­ing to re­peat the 2016 play­book. He’s com­ing back to th­ese three states. He did that ef­fec­tively, sur­prised us all, and won with that strat­egy.’’</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR CHARLES FRANKLIN, di­rec­tor of the Mar­quette Law School poll, on US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s strat­egy.</p>
