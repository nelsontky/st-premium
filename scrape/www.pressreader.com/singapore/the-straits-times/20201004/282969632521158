    <p>ISCHGL (Aus­tria) • They came from across the world to ski in the most fa­mous re­sorts of the Aus­trian Alps.</p>
    <p>Mr Ja­cob Homiller and his col­lege friends flew in from the United States. Ms Jane Witt, a re­tired lec­turer, ar­rived from London for a fam­ily re­union. Ms An­nette Garten, the youth di­rec­tor at a ten­nis club in Ham­burg, Ger­many, was cel­e­brat­ing her birth­day with her hus­band and two grown chil­dren.</p>
    <p>They knew in late Fe­bru­ary and early March that the coro­n­avirus was spread­ing in nearby north­ern Italy and across the other bor­der in Ger­many, but no one was alarmed. Aus­trian of­fi­cials down­played con­cerns as tourists crowded into cable cars by day and apres-ski bars at night.</p>
    <p>“The whole world meets in Ischgl,” Ms Garten said.</p>
    <p>Then they all went home, un­wit­tingly tak­ing the virus with them. In­fected in Ischgl (pro­nounced “ISHgul”) or in sur­round­ing vil­lages, thou­sands of skiers car­ried the coro­n­avirus to more than 40 coun­tries on five con­ti­nents. Many of Ice­land’s first known cases were traced to Ischgl. In March, nearly half the cases i n Nor­way were linked to Aus­trian ski hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Nine months into an out­break that has killed one mil­lion peo­ple world­wide, Ischgl is where the era of global tourism, made pos­si­ble by cheap air­fares and open bor­ders, col­lided with a pan­demic. For decades, as trade and travel drew the world closer, pub­lic health policy, en­shrined by treaty, en­cour­aged global mass tourism by call­ing for open bor­ders, even dur­ing out­breaks.</p>
    <p>When the coro­n­avirus emerged in China in Jan­uary, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) didn’t flinch in its ad­vice: Do not re­strict travel. But what is now clear is that the policy was about pol­i­tics and eco­nom­ics more than pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health records, scores of sci­en­tific stud­ies and in­ter­views with more than two dozen ex­perts show that the policy of un­ob­structed travel was never based on hard sci­ence. It was a po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sion, re­cast as health ad­vice, which emerged after a plague out­break in In­dia in the 1990s. By the time Covid-19 sur­faced, it had be­come an ar­ti­cle of faith.</p>
    <p>“It’s part of the re­li­gion of global health: Travel and trade re­stric­tions are bad,” said pro­fes­sor of global health law Lawrence Gostin at Ge­orge­town Univer­sity who helped write the global rules known as the In­ter­na­tional Health Reg­u­la­tions. “I’m one of the con­gre­gants.”</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has shat­tered that faith. Be­fore the pan­demic, a few stud­ies had demon­strated that travel re­stric­tions de­layed, but did not stop, the spread of se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (or Sars), pan­demic flu and Ebola. Most, how­ever, were based on math­e­mat­i­cal mod­els. No one had col­lected real-world data. The ef­fect of travel re­stric­tions on the spread of the lat­est coro­n­avirus is still not un­der­stood.</p>
    <p>“Any­one who is truth­ful is go­ing to tell you it’s a big fat ‘We don’t know’,” said Pro­fes­sor Keiji Fukuda, a for­mer se­nior WHO of­fi­cial who teaches at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Not know­ing is es­pe­cially vex­ing as the world seeks a way back to nor­malcy. For months, na­tional lead­ers have in­voked travel re­stric­tions that vary in strict­ness and are of­ten con­tra­dic­tory. Some shut their bor­ders and si­mul­ta­ne­ously im­posed do­mes­tic lock­downs. Oth­ers re­quired tests and quar­an­tines. Many reg­u­larly re­vised their lists of risky des­ti­na­tions, some­times re­spond­ing tit for tat when their ci­ti­zens were de­nied en­try.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions have hum­bled pow­er­ful na­tions like the US, whose ci­ti­zens are no l onger wel­come across most of the world. Even so, Pres­i­dent Donald Trump has called his travel re­stric­tions “the big­gest de­ci­sion we made so far” and at­tacked the WHO’s early ad­vice on bor­ders as “dis­as­trous”. Still, it is too soon to know, based on data and hard sci­ence, how much travel re­stric­tions help and, if they do, which re­stric­tions help most.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts who had de­fended open bor­ders at the start of the pan­demic now say coun­tries should use ju­di­cious travel mea­sures. The WHO now calls for a grad­ual re­open­ing in which each coun­try weighs its own risks.</p>
    <p>“There is cer­tainly a stark shift in how it’s be­ing dis­cussed,” said Pro­fes­sor Kel­ley Lee at Si­mon Fraser Univer­sity in Canada who is study­ing the im­pact of travel re­stric­tions in this pan­demic. “But the ev­i­dence hasn’t changed. We still have poor ev­i­dence.” What is vividly clear is that global pub­lic health poli­cies are in­ad­e­quate, es­pe­cially re­gard­ing travel. Low-cost air­lines have cre­ated a surge in global travel. The num­ber of peo­ple tak­ing at least one overseas trip a year has grown by 80 per cent since the reg­u­la­tions were for­mu­lated in 2005.</p>
    <p>The ease and ex­pan­sion of global travel is why “su­per­spreader” events helped ac­cel­er­ate the pan­demic: Just as skiers in Ischgl car­ried the virus around the world, con­gre­gants at a French megachurch took the dis­ease to Africa, Latin Amer­ica and across Europe.</p>
    <p>After his trip to Aus­tria, Mr Homiller and at least four friends tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus. Ms Witt buck­led from ex­haus­tion in her kitchen and ended up fight­ing for her life. Ms Garten’s fam­ily be­came sick, too, and in Ger­many, her hus­band was hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>Now at least 1,000 peo­ple from dozens of coun­tries in­tend to sue the Aus­trian gov­ern­ment. A lawyer in Vi­enna filed the first test cases re­cently on be­half of four vis­i­tors, two of whom have since died of Covid-19. The law­suit says the gov­ern­ment should have closed the re­sort ear­lier and told tourists to stay away.</p>
    <p>“They knew; they just weren’t telling any­one,” said Ms Witt, who is part of the law­suit. “Wealth be­fore health.”</p>
    <p>PLAGUE AND PANIC</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up in Ham­burg, Ms Garten was 16 when her fam­ily first vis­ited the sleepy re­sort of Ischgl in the late 1980s. It catered to avid skiers, mostly Ger­mans. Cow ma­nure some­times lit­tered the streets. “It was a nor­mal Aus­trian vil­lage,” she said.</p>
    <p>The vil­lage be­came a re­sort in the 1960s after an en­ter­pris­ing res­i­dent went door to door col­lect­ing money for a cable car. When Ms Garten vis­ited, it was hardly on the global tourism map. That be­gan to change in the 1990s, when Ms Garten started spot­ting Bri­tons on the slopes and Rus­sians in big furry hats. New ho­tels rose along the nar­row streets. Stars like El­ton John and Bob Dylan head­lined con­certs.</p>
    <p>The same forces of glob­al­i­sa­tion re­shap­ing Ischgl were trans­form­ing the world. Multi­na­tional com­pa­nies em­braced out­sourc­ing and in­ter­na­tional sup­ply chains. Global trade made coun­tries in­ter­de­pen­dent, which also came with risks.</p>
    <p>In the fall of 1994, a plague out­break struck the In­dian port city of Su­rat. Hys­te­ria erupted, and coun­tries quickly banned travel to In­dia. Tourists aban­doned their va­ca­tions. Air­lines can­celled flights. The United Arab Emi­rates banned In­dian cargo, while Rus­sia de­manded quar­an­tines on ship­ments.</p>
    <p>Plague is not un­com­mon, with small out­breaks ev­ery year, even in the US, and Su­rat’s out­break turned out to be rel­a­tively mild, with just over 50 deaths. But the global panic dev­as­tated the city and cost In­dia’s econ­omy an es­ti­mated US$3 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The re­ac­tion to the out­break alarmed Pro­fes­sor David Hey­mann, an Amer­i­can epi­demi­ol­o­gist who was then a se­nior WHO of­fi­cial in­volved in the agency’s re­sponse to Su­rat. In­dian of­fi­cials had prop­erly re­ported the out­break and quickly brought it un­der con­trol. Yet In­dia was pun­ished, a re­sponse he con­sid­ered “ir­ra­tional”. “It had noth­ing to do with the out­break,” said Prof Hey­mann.</p>
    <p>At the time, the In­ter­na­tional Health Reg­u­la­tions were de­signed to pre­vent trade in­ter­rup­tions. But they ap­plied to only three dis­eases: plague, cholera and yel­low fever. En­force­ment was im­pos­si­ble, and coun­tries of­ten im­ple­mented ar­bi­trary travel bans for other dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Su­rat ex­posed the most glar­ing blind spot. The world’s pan­demic alert sys­tem de­pended on po­lit­i­cal lead­ers to sound the alarm. If fi­nan­cial ruin was the cost, no coun­try would re­port an out­break.</p>
    <p>“That re­ally made us re­alise that the reg­u­la­tions had to be changed,” Prof Hey­mann said.</p>
    <p>The WHO soon un­der­took a broad re­assess­ment of the rules, but the re­vi­sions ground slowly un­til the Sars epi­demic hit in 2003. Fear­ing a pan­demic, the WHO ad­vised against travel to af­fected coun­tries, the most strin­gent rec­om­men­da­tions in its 55-year his­tory.</p>
    <p>Most of the af­fected coun­tries were in Asia, but it was Canada that felt most ag­grieved after the WHO ad­vised against travel to Toronto. Then, WHO mem­ber states gath­ered dur­ing the Sars epi­demic and told the agency to com­plete the re­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>This time, the process was swift. In 2005, diplo­mats struck a com­pro­mise in­tended to bal­ance pub­lic health needs with the eco­nomic con­se­quences of “un­nec­es­sary in­ter­fer­ence” with travel and trade. While the new rules did not ex­plic­itly pro­hibit coun­tries from clos­ing bor­ders or re­strict­ing trade, they made it clear that do­ing so should be a last re­sort. But the rules were never based on a sci­en­tific body of ev­i­dence. There were rea­son­able as­sump­tions: Closed bor­ders could slow the ar­rival of medicine and aid work­ers, for ex­am­ple. Yet, no one stud­ied whether re­strict­ing travel might slow a fast-spread­ing dis­ease, partly be­cause there was no tra­di­tion of col­lect­ing data on such in­ter­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t think we needed to mea­sure them be­cause we thought we knew,” said Prof Gostin, who was in­volved in the re­vi­sion process. “Clearly, we didn’t.”</p>
    <p>The new rules took ef­fect in 2007 even as the world was rapidly mak­ing them ob­so­lete. Fo­cused heav­ily on trade, they failed to ac­count for “a tourism in­dus­try that grows out of bounds”, said Pro­fes­sor Ilona Kick­busch at the Grad­u­ate In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional and De­vel­op­ment Stud­ies in Geneva.</p>
    <p>By the 2000s, Ischgl’s nightlife had earned it the nick­name of “the Ibiza of the Alps”. Huge park­ing lots had been built for a stream of buses from across Europe. More sig­nif­i­cant, though, was the im­pact of low-cost air travel.</p>
    <p>To­day, tourists can reach Ischgl from eight nearby air­ports in Aus­tria, Ger­many, Switzer­land and Italy. One of them, Mem­min­gen Air­port in Ger­many, was once a mil­i­tary air­field whose rapid trans­for­ma­tion be­gan when Ryanair, Ire­land’s low-cost car­rier, started fly­ing there in 2009. The air­port now serves sev­eral bud­get air­lines and had more than 1.7 mil­lion pas­sen­gers last year.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, flights via Mu­nich and Zurich have brought tourists from as far away as Amer­ica and China, and Ischgl to­day hosts 300,000 tourists from 36 coun­tries ev­ery year. This win­ter, Ischgl’s ho­tels were full, even as omi­nous re­ports were emerg­ing from Italy.</p>
    <p>Ms Garten said she never wor­ried. She laughed when her boss warned her not to bring back the virus. “I thought, we are go­ing into the moun­tains; we will be out­side in the fresh air,” she said. “What could pos­si­bly hap­pen?”</p>
    <p>A FRANTIC EXODUS</p>
    <p>Ms Garten comes to Ischgl to ski and rarely goes out, but she made an ex­cep­tion the night be­fore her 50th birth­day. When she ar­rived at the Kit­zloch bar with her hus­band and some friends, the floor was packed, and the mu­sic thump­ing. Drunk pa­trons danced in ski gear. Servers blew whis­tles – twice into her face – to part the rau­cous crowds. “I just re­mem­ber the whole ex­pe­ri­ence as be­ing very wet,” she re­called.</p>
    <p>That night, March 5, Ice­land is­sued a warn­ing against travel to Ischgl after more than a dozen re­turn­ing trav­ellers tested pos­i­tive. Two days later, a Ger­man bar­tender at the Kit­zloch be­came the first Covid-19 case con­firmed in Ischgl, yet lo­cal of­fi­cials re­as­sured guests that all was well.</p>
    <p>“From a med­i­cal point of view, trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus to guests in the bar is rather un­likely,” a pro­vin­cial med­i­cal di­rec­tor said in a state­ment the next day.</p>
    <p>The Kit­zloch was dis­in­fected and re­opened for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The day after that, its en­tire wait­ing staff tested pos­i­tive. Mr Bern­hard Zangerl, the 25-year-old man­ager, blamed “bad luck” and chafed at ac­cu­sa­tions of neg­li­gence.</p>
    <p>“The virus is not from Ischgl,” said Mr Zangerl, who was also in­fected. “It was brought here.” By then, though, Europe’s sys­tem of seam­less travel was col­laps­ing. An over­whelmed Italy had closed its bor­ders. In Vi­enna, Aus­trian lead­ers strug­gled to re­spond to an up­ended world.</p>
    <p>“Only a few weeks ear­lier, we had looked at China and told our­selves, ‘Such a quar­an­tine is only pos­si­ble in China’,” said Aus­tria’s Health Min­is­ter Ru­dolf An­schober. That month, he said, his gov­ern­ment had to make de­ci­sions that he had once found “im­pos­si­ble to imag­ine”. The Kit­zloch closed, but other bars stayed open an­other day, even as warn­ings poured in from the rest of Europe.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the pro­vin­cial gov­er­nor, Mr Gun­ther Plat­ter, an­nounced that the win­ter sea­son would end early in the en­tire prov­ince, rather than risk al­low­ing an­other 150,000 guests to ar­rive the com­ing Satur­day. “It meant that €1.5 bil­lion (S$2.4 bil­lion) was gone,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Plat­ter said his prov­ince had no guid­ance be­cause or­gan­i­sa­tions like the WHO and Ger­many’s Robert Koch In­sti­tute were slow to re­act. At the time, Mr Plat­ter said, he felt like he was go­ing “too far, too fast”. Mr Peter Kolba, the Vi­en­nese lawyer who is lead­ing the lit­i­ga­tion against the Aus­trian gov­ern­ment, ar­gued that the val­ley should have been closed a week ear­lier, after the first few cases had been linked to Ischgl. It re­mained open only be­cause of­fi­cials were in­ter­ested in tourism, he said.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery day is pre­cious in the win­ter sea­son, es­pe­cially in Ischgl, where peo­ple spend a lot of money,” Mr Kolba said.</p>
    <p>Once Mr Plat­ter de­cided to shut­ter the re­sorts, lo­cal of­fi­cials quickly drafted an evac­u­a­tion plan. For­eign tourists would leave, while Aus­tri­ans and sea­sonal work­ers would be quar­an­tined. But be­fore it was made pub­lic, Aus­tria’s Chan­cel­lor un­ex­pect­edly an­nounced the shut­down on tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one scram­bled to leave. Ms Witt, the re­tired lec­turer from London, saw shop­keep­ers hastily lock­ing up in the nearby vil­lage of St An­ton. Her daugh­ter, who was still ski­ing, no­ticed ski-lift op­er­a­tors aban­don­ing their posts.</p>
    <p>“Within an hour, there was no­body on the street,” Ms Witt said. “It was fright­en­ing.” The val­ley’s main road was clogged with honk­ing cars. Po­lice could not col­lect con­tact-trac­ing forms from many de­part­ing tourists, leav­ing their home coun­tries blind to the dan­gers head­ing their way, ac­cord­ing to Mr Kolba.</p>
    <p>At least 27 tourists died after con­tract­ing the virus in Ischgl, St An­ton and neigh­bour­ing towns, Mr Kolba said. More than 11,000 Euro­peans were in­fected in Aus­tria, many of them in Ischgl and ad­ja­cent re­sorts, re­search by Aus­tria’s pub­lic broad­caster ORF showed. Re­searchers from the Univer­sity of Inns­bruck tested 1,500 Ischgl res­i­dents in April and found that 42 per cent had an­ti­bod­ies for the virus.</p>
    <p>A VERY UNCER­TAIN FU­TURE</p>
    <p>Mr An­dreas Steibl, the jovial, quirky di­rec­tor of Ischgl’s tourism board, has little doubt the re­sort will re­cover. Some tourists, like Mr Homiller, are de­ter­mined to re­turn.</p>
    <p>“We should go back,” he said. “Even though a bunch of us ended up sick, it was a great week.” Yet, in­fec­tions are on the rise, and no one can say what the world will look like when ski sea­son be­gins next month. Re­turn­ing to a world of unim­peded travel seems hard to imag­ine, at least for now.</p>
    <p>As sci­en­tists world­wide race to make a vac­cine, un­der­stand­ing the role of travel in a pan­demic – and what types of re­stric­tions could prove ef­fec­tive – is also crit­i­cal, if likely to take much longer. This month, the WHO be­gan an­other re­view of the In­ter­na­tional Health Reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Prof Hey­mann, who helped shape the last re­vi­sion, ac­knowl­edges that the cur­rent reg­u­la­tions “are not fit for pur­pose on travel and trade”. “More and more,” he said, “we’re un­der­stand­ing that there are some times when travel and trade might need to be re­stricted.”</p>
    <p>Still, ex­perts like Prof Gostin fear that in the ab­sence of data, the world will over-cor­rect – only to find dur­ing the next pan­demic that new re­stric­tions have slowed ac­cess to medicine, de­layed res­cue work­ers and need­lessly dam­aged frag­ile economies.</p>
    <p>“If we’re go­ing to make choices that af­fect the world so pro­foundly, we need to un­der­stand if they work,” he said. “Oth­er­wise, we’re just fly­ing blind.”</p>
