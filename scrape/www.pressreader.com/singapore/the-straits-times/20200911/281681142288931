    <p>A poll com­mis­sioned by the Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) and done by the Gov­ern­ment feed­back unit Reach found that seven in 10 re­spon­dents were sat­is­fied with their ex­pe­ri­ence at polling sta­tions.</p>
    <p>The fact that the other three in 10 had a less than sat­is­fac­tory vot­ing ex­pe­ri­ence is “not ac­cept­able”, the ELD said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We apol­o­gise for this, and thank vot­ers for their pa­tience,” it added.</p>
    <p>The poll also found that those who voted in schools and com­mu­nity clubs or cen­tres, which typ­i­cally house polling sta­tions that serve larger num­bers of vot­ers, re­ported poorer vot­ing ex­pe­ri­ences be­cause of the length of time it took to vote.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey was car­ried out be­tween July 23 and 30, and in­volved more than 1,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans above the age of 21. The re­sults were weighted by gen­der, race and age to en­sure they are de­mo­graph­i­cally rep­re­sen­ta­tive.</p>
    <p>Around 78 per cent felt the polling process was well or­gan­ised.</p>
    <p>About 17 per cent were neu­tral and 4 per cent dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>Asked if elec­tion of­fi­cers were help­ful to vot­ers when car­ry­ing out their elec­tion du­ties, about 77 per cent agreed, while 20 per cent were neu­tral and 4 per cent dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent said they spent less than 30 min­utes for vot­ing. A fur­ther 9 per cent said they took 45 min­utes or more to vote.</p>
    <p>Voter sat­is­fac­tion de­creased sig­nif­i­cantly when vot­ers had to wait longer to vote.</p>
    <p>The ELD noted that a “cliff ef­fect” was ob­served when the vot­ing time reached 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>While 84 per cent of vot­ers who took less than 10 min­utes agreed they were sat­is­fied with their over­all ex­pe­ri­ence at the polling sta­tion, only 54 per cent of those who took be­tween 30 and 44 min­utes agreed.</p>
    <p>Only one in 10 of those who took longer than an hour to vote said they were sat­is­fied.</p>
    <p>The ELD said yes­ter­day that it will im­prove its sys­tems and pro­cesses as it pre­pares for fu­ture elec­tions.</p>
