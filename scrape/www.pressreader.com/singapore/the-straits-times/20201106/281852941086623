    <p>•</p>
    <p>COPENHAGEN Den­mark, the world’s big­gest pro­ducer of mink fur, is to cull all of the coun­try’s minks af­ter a mu­tated ver­sion of the coro­n­avirus was found at mink farms and had spread to peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The mu­ta­tion “could pose a risk that fu­ture (coro­n­avirus) vac­cines won’t work the way they should,” Prime Min­is­ter Mette Fred­erik­sen said at a press con­fer­ence on Wed­nes­day. “It is nec­es­sary to cull all the minks.”</p>
    <p>Den­mark’s po­lice chief Thork­ild Fogde has said the culling would start as “soon as pos­si­ble”, but con­ceded that with 15 mil­lion to 17 mil­lion minks spread over 1,080 farms, it would be “a very large un­der­tak­ing”.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) said the coro­n­avirus spreads pri­mar­ily through hu­manto-hu­man trans­mis­sion, but that</p>
    <p>“there is ev­i­dence of trans­mis­sion at the hu­man-an­i­mal in­ter­face”.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral an­i­mals – in­clud­ing dogs and cats – have tested pos­i­tive for the virus and there have been re­ported cases at mink farms in the Nether­lands and Spain, as well as in Den­mark. “In a few in­stances, the minks that were in­fected by hu­mans have trans­mit­ted the virus to other peo­ple. These are the first re­ported cases of an­i­mal-to-hu­man trans­mis­sion,” the WHO said in a state­ment sent to AFP.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has been de­tected at 207 Dan­ish mink farms,</p>
    <p>in­clud­ing some cases with a mu­tated ver­sion that has been con­firmed to spread back to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties have also con­cluded that the mu­tated virus “is not in­hib­ited by an­ti­bod­ies to the same de­gree as the nor­mal virus”. “Stud­ies have shown that the mu­ta­tions may af­fect the cur­rent can­di­dates for a Covid-19 vac­cine,” Health Min­is­ter Mag­nus He­u­nicke said. “It is a threat to the de­vel­op­ment of coro­n­avirus vac­cines. That is why it is im­por­tant that we make a na­tional ef­fort,” he added.</p>
