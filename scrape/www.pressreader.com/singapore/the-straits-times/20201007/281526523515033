    <p>Deal-mak­ing in Sin­ga­pore is pick­ing up pace, with the real es­tate sec­tor lead­ing the charge.</p>
    <p>The height­ened ac­tiv­ity sig­nals grow­ing op­ti­mism among com­pa­nies and in­vestors that there will be a strong re­bound from the depths of the coro­n­avirus-in­duced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a dull start – deal-mak­ing screeched to a vir­tual halt in April and May – merger and ac­qui­si­tion (M&A) ac­tiv­ity surged 38 per cent in the third quar­ter to Sept 17, com­pared with the sec­ond quar­ter, noted Refini­tiv.</p>
    <p>The surge pushed M&As an­nounced from Jan 1 to Sept 17 to a to­tal of US$69.9 bil­lion (S$95 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Real es­tate deals led the way, ac­count­ing for 30.8 per cent or US$21.6 bil­lion. Over­all do­mes­tic M&As hit US$22.6 bil­lion – the high­est first nine-month to­tal and 21.4 per cent above the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The key driver was the pro­posed US$7.998 bil­lion merger of Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust and Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust.</p>
    <p>This is the largest do­mes­tic M&A on record, sur­pass­ing Cap­i­taLand’s US$7.9 bil­lion ac­qui­si­tion of As­cen­das last year.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said ac­qui­si­tion ac­tiv­ity in real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits) is stir­ring back to life, as the neg­a­tive im­pact of Covid-19 on cash flows is fad­ing and share prices are sta­bil­is­ing.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank an­a­lyst Derek Tan said more prop­erty acquisitio­ns are likely in the fourth quar­ter and the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>Deals will be sup­ported by low in­ter­est rates and higher ca­pac­ity to raise debt af­ter an en­hanced gear­ing limit of 50 per cent – com­pared with 45 per cent pre­vi­ously – an­nounced by the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said: “While in the midst of a grad­ual re­cov­ery, we are con­fi­dent that an or­ganic earn­ings re­cov­ery will start to fil­ter through from the third quar­ter of 2020 on the back of green shoots emerg­ing across most Reits sub-sec­tors, ex­cept for hos­pi­tal­ity, where the re­cov­ery ap­pears to be most nascent for now.”</p>
    <p>He be­lieves the rel­a­tively low cost of rais­ing cap­i­tal will boost real es­tate acquisitio­ns in the in­dus­trial space, es­pe­cially given that de­mand for lo­gis­tics and data cen­tres is ex­pected to spike.</p>
    <p>Some of­fice and hos­pi­tal­ity Reits may re­cy­cle pro­ceeds from past di­vest­ments to claw back their lost in­come, he noted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, fresh cap­i­tal rais­ing in eq­uity and debt mar­kets is still in the early stages of re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal rais­ing is seen as an in­di­ca­tor of com­pa­nies’ abil­ity to ac­quire new as­sets.</p>
    <p>Refini­tiv noted that eq­uity and eq­uity-linked cap­i­tal is­suance by Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies to­talled US$4.9 bil­lion in the first nine months of this year – 22 per cent less than the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Fol­low-on of­fer­ings fell 23.2 per cent from last year, with US$3.1 bil­lion worth of pro­ceeds.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPOs) by</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies raised US$681.1 mil­lion, down 67.1 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>Elite Com­mer­cial Reit’s US$170.5 mil­lion IPO is the largest Sin­ga­pore listing so far this year.</p>
    <p>In the debt mar­ket, pri­mary bond of­fer­ings from Sin­ga­pore-domi­ciled is­suers have raised US$19.5 bil­lion this year, down 24.6 per cent from a year ear­lier and mark­ing the low­est first nine-month to­tal since 2015.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies from the fi­nan­cial sec­tor cap­tured 53.4 per cent of the debt mar­ket share and raised US$10.4 bil­lion in the first nine months of this year.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate fol­lowed be­hind with a 12.4 per cent mar­ket share worth US$2.4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts agree that over­all eco­nomic re­cov­ery here is still frag­ile, but the out­look is turn­ing brighter.</p>
    <p>“While we ac­knowl­edge that we are not to­tally out of the woods in terms of an or­ganic earn­ings re­cov­ery post-Covid-19, we do see green shoots emerg­ing across most sub­sec­tors,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>While in­vestors may be wor­ried about the po­ten­tial “cliff ef­fect” when gov­ern­ment fis­cal sup­port ta­pers off next March, an­a­lysts be­lieve the econ­omy would have re­bounded some­what by then, in turn di­min­ish­ing most of the sys­temic risks now that con­cern in­vestors.</p>
    <p>“Even in a sce­nario that growth restart stut­ters, we be­lieve that the Gov­ern­ment stands ready to pro­vide the nec­es­sary fis­cal sup­port when the need arises,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>He ad­vises in­vestors to start con­sid­er­ing the next phase of growth for Reits, which will come mostly from acquisitio­ns.</p>
