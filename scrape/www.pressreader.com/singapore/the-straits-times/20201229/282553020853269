    <p>It’s been a year of al­most no travel. Yet, we have dis­cov­ered the joy of travel in re­fresh­ingly al­ter­na­tive ways, from re­motely ex­plor­ing coun­tries like Ser­bia through the eyes of for­eign friends to play­ing tourist at home.</p>
    <p>Here are seven ways to keep your love of travel burn­ing bright.</p>
    <p>1 CON­NECT WITH A FRIEND FROM AN­OTHER COUN­TRY</p>
    <p>Scrolling through my list of con­tacts, I send a What­sApp mes­sage to Mar­ija Ralic, a friend from Ser­bia whom I had met at a work con­fer­ence a few years back.</p>
    <p>I ask her about her favourite Ser­bian food. “Stuffed pep­pers,” she re­sponds.</p>
    <p>I im­me­di­ately search for the recipe and start learn­ing about Ser­bia’s rich cheese tra­di­tion. Pule, among the world’s most ex­pen­sive cheeses, is made with the milk of Balkan don­keys.</p>
    <p>In no time, I have read up about the Ser­bian city of Novi Sad, which has won the bid for next year’s Euro­pean Cap­i­tal of Cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Ser­bia had not been on my travel wish-list, but it is now. When I visit, I will al­ready be past the in­tro­duc­tion phase and ready to be friends with it.</p>
    <p>2 TEACH­ING TRAVEL</p>
    <p>The last decade has seen con­fi­dent par­ents ex­pose chil­dren to travel much ear­lier and more fre­quently. Chil­dren now in­te­grate travel with learn­ing and play, with much en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>Now that travel is not pos­si­ble, keep the flame alive with sub­scrip­tion boxes for kids.</p>
    <p>Ms Abi­gail Chee and Ms Matilda Huang, both 37, are the founders of a sub­scrip­tion ser­vice, El­lieFun Box, which de­liv­ers creative ac­tiv­i­ties in English and Chi­nese. Prices vary, with the lat­est Christ­mas box cost­ing $55.</p>
    <p>Ms Chee says: “Learn­ing about world cul­tures is very much part of the Montes­sori cur­ricu­lum and we try to bring that as­pect into our boxes and on­line pro­gramme.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, chil­dren learn about the four sea­sons, the coun­tries that ex­pe­ri­ence them and the way peo­ple live in these places.</p>
    <p>3 TELE­VI­SION, FILM AND BOOKS</p>
    <p>For the last few months, I have grav­i­tated to­wards tele­vi­sion shows and films where the ge­og­ra­phy is al­most like a main char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>Bowled over by the movie Par­a­site (2019) and tele­vi­sion se­ries Crash Land­ing On You (2020), I want to know more about life in South Korea. This leads me to the book Un­der­stand­ing Ev­ery­day Life In Korea by Kim Young-hoon. It goes beyond cliches like kim­chi and K-pop, which is how I want my travel to be.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the scripted re­al­ity show Made In Chelsea has made me miss London. In the award-win­ning show, af­flu­ent mil­len­ni­als jet off to ex­otic lo­cales.</p>
    <p>I am also glued to Net­flix’s mys­tery drama Trapped (2015 to present), set in Iceland. I am cap­ti­vated as much by the who­dunit as the Nordic snow-capped moun­tain magic.</p>
    <p>4 RECHARGE WITH NA­TURE</p>
    <p>Many of us are us­ing this pan­demic sea­son to recharge. Some have been eval­u­at­ing ca­reer choices, while oth­ers are dis­cov­er­ing new tal­ents. We have seen enough In­sta­gram ev­i­dence of the chefs, artists and fit­ness en­thu­si­asts cre­ated by lock­downs around the world.</p>
    <p>Ms Fern Goh, 46, in­vestor, mother and trav­eller, used to go on 10- to 12-day va­ca­tions ev­ery two months, in­ter­spersed with two-night trips.</p>
    <p>She says: “Since we have trav­elled so much, we do not feel short­changed in these no-travel days. It is a great op­por­tu­nity to re­set our lives, which were on auto-pilot mode be­fore 2020.” She is pleased that her pi­lates re­former ma­chine is be­ing used ev­ery day now.</p>
    <p>I don’t own fit­ness equip­ment, but have been walk­ing around the many green spa­ces in Sin­ga­pore. Like many, I have rekin­dled a re­la­tion­ship with na­ture.</p>
    <p>5 TRY GLOBAL CUISINES</p>
    <p>Travel and tan­ta­lis­ing our taste buds are linked in­trin­si­cally.</p>
    <p>In­deed, food was the fo­cal point of my trip to Taipei in Jan­uary. Seek­ing out the city’s culi­nary of­fer­ings pro­vided tran­quil­lity on an anx­i­ety-filled trip. The pan­demic had not been de­clared, yet dark clouds of an im­pend­ing calamity seemed om­nipresent.</p>
    <p>It was nour­ish­ing too, for Taipei, with its meat-free op­tions, spoils veg­e­tar­i­ans like me in a way few Asian cities can. I de­lighted in Dream­ers Cof­fee Roast­ers, a Tai­wanese cof­fee chain that is 100 per cent veg­e­tar­ian. Din Tai Fung also of­fers veg­e­tar­ian and ve­gan menus in its home­land.</p>
    <p>These days, I rem­i­nisce about the tastes of travel and am grate­ful to be liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore with its many de­li­cious pos­si­bil­i­ties, al­low­ing me to con­tinue “food travel”.</p>
    <p>6 OR­GAN­ISE TRAVEL PHO­TOS</p>
    <p>In our ob­ses­sion with cap­tur­ing ev­ery sin­gle moment dig­i­tally, we seem to have an abun­dant amount of mem­o­ries to doc­u­ment, not nec­es­sar­ily savour.</p>
    <p>The pause caused by the pan­demic is a good time to re­flect on and re­joice in jour­neys we were for­tu­nate to have ex­pe­ri­enced.</p>
    <p>I laugh at how overzeal­ous I was in not want­ing to miss any­thing, which even led me to take pho­tos of sign­posts to read later.</p>
    <p>It has been fun go­ing down the travel mem­ory lane – se­lect­ing and sort­ing im­ages, and re­mind­ing my­self to live in the moment.</p>
    <p>7 BE A TOURIST AT HOME</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a trea­sure trove of hid­den gems. Be it ad­ven­ture, his­tory, luxury, cui­sine or just an old-fash­ioned walk in the park – this year has helped us ap­pre­ci­ate our lit­tle red dot more.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Su-Lyn, an en­tre­pre­neur in her 40s and a mother of three, says: “There are many op­por­tu­ni­ties for tak­ing chil­dren out of their ev­ery­day lives with­out hav­ing to leave the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Her top tip is jump­ing on a dou­ble-decker bus and tak­ing her chil­dren to a mys­tery des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>I have re­sumed my travel rit­ual of chat­ting with strangers in Sin­ga­pore as well.</p>
    <p>I am now al­ways ea­ger to ex­change a few words with taxi driv­ers, cof­fee shop servers or peo­ple in a queue.</p>
    <p>Just a sense of what they had for lunch, or an anec­dote of a hair­cut gone wrong, bright­ens my day. My re­ac­tion is echoed by a twin­kle in their eyes.</p>
    <p>In that fleet­ing moment, we ac­knowl­edge each other’s smile be­hind our masks and have made a con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>For me, that will al­ways be the true essence of travel.</p>
