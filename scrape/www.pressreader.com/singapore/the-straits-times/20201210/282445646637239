    <p>• Frank Lam­pard praised Chelsea’s “good pro­gres­sion” af­ter Jorginho’s penalty res­cued a 1-1 draw against Krasnodar in their last Cham­pi­ons League Group E match on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Blues had al­ready qual­i­fied for the last 16 as group win­ners af­ter beat­ing Sevilla 4-0 last week.</p>
    <p>Even so, they were look­ing to avoid los­ing to the Rus­sian min­nows. But that was the prospect they faced af­ter Remy Ca­bella gave Krasnodar a shock lead in the first half at Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard had made 10 changes to his start­ing XI from the 3-1 win over Leeds in the Premier League last week­end.</p>
    <p>Jorginho saved his un­der­strength team from em­bar­rass­ment when he stroked in a penalty mo­ments af­ter the opener.</p>
    <p>Chelsea are un­beaten i n 14 games in all com­pe­ti­tions as they look to mount a Premier League ti­tle chase and chal­lenge in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>“I liked the dis­ci­pline of the team. I’m very pleased. We wanted to win but that wasn’t to be,” Lam­pard said. “Ev­ery­one was pretty good. There weren’t out­stand­ing per­for­mances but I asked the lads to be pro­fes­sional and they were.</p>
    <p>“We’ve won the group and it’s good pro­gres­sion.”</p>
    <p>In Group F, Lazio also ad­vanced fol­low­ing a tense 2-2 draw at home to Club Brugge in the rain.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ians fin­ished sec­ond be­hind Borussia Dort­mund, book­ing their spot in the knock­out phase for the first time since the 1999-2000 sea­son, when t hey reached the quar­ter-fi­nals with cur­rent coach Si­mone In­za­ghi lead­ing the team’s at­tack.</p>
    <p>“We are back in the Cham­pi­ons League af­ter 13 years, and it’s been 20 years since we’ve got into the sec­ond round,” said In­za­ghi.</p>
    <p>“It’s a de­served qual­i­fi­ca­tion that we have earned on the pitch.”</p>
    <p>Dort­mund striker Yous­so­ufa Moukoko, aged 16 years and 18 days, be­came the youngest player in Cham­pi­ons League his­tory as he came off the bench in a 2-1 win at Zenit Saint Peters­burg.</p>
    <p>The Cameroon-born Moukoko, who came on as a 58th-minute sub­sti­tute, eclipsed Ce­les­tine Baba­yaro, who was 16 years and 87 days when he played for An­der­lecht in Novem­ber 1994.</p>
    <p>NO FUSS</p>
    <p>There weren’t out­stand­ing per­for­mances but I asked the lads to be pro­fes­sional and they were.</p>
    <p>FRANK LAM­PARD, Chelsea man­ager, on the Blues’ busi­nesslike play.</p>
