    <p>Rida Video Cen­tre, one of Sin­ga­pore’s last video-ren­tal stores, is a bas­tion of a van­ish­ing age.</p>
    <p>Born in the golden era of VHS shops in the 1980s, the cosy mo­mand-pop shop in Coronation Shop­ping Plaza is crammed from floor to ceil­ing with more than 10,000 ti­tles – from dra­mas and doc­u­men­taries to car­toons and art-house films – gleam­ing be­neath the warm lights.</p>
    <p>The brick-and-mor­tar hold­out was founded 35 years ago by owner Lau­rel Khoo and her late hus­band Ooi Kai Peng, and orig­i­nally lo­cated in Serene Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>It has been bruised by the rise of on­line stream­ing services, with a 30 per cent dip in busi­ness over the past five years.</p>
    <p>Gone are the old VHS tapes, laser discs and VCDs: DVDs, Blu-ray and 4K Ul­tra HD discs are its main­stay now.</p>
    <p>But its per­sonal touch re­mains and the 60-year-old owner – a soft­spo­ken, ma­ter­nal woman with a hearty laugh – says she wants to keep the shop go­ing for as long as she can.</p>
    <p>“Net­flix can­not chat with you, but we can. And we can chat about any­thing, not just movies,” says Madam Khoo, a walk­ing en­cy­clopae­dia of film ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Be­fore I can say “pause”, she hops off her stool and gives me a dizzy­ing tour of the DVDs on dis­play – from Mex­i­can-in­spired Dis­ney film Coco (“Colour­ful, beau­ti­ful”) to Ja­panese movie De­par­tures (“If you want to cry, watch this”) to Le­banese sleeper hit Caper­naum (“Why would a boy want to sue his par­ents?”).</p>
    <p>Rida stocks the usual Hol­ly­wood block­busters and tele­vi­sion dra­mas, but I also spy plenty of in­die films – from Pe­dro Almod­ovar’s late-life mas­ter­piece Pain And Glory to Richard Lin­klater’s Be­fore Sun­rise. Ev­ery­thing can be rented, but more than 500 ti­tles are also for sale, in­clud­ing newer 4K Ul­tra HD and Blu-ray discs.</p>
    <p>“If cus­tomers want cer­tain ti­tles, we will bring them in if we can.”</p>
    <p>Rida Video Cen­tre has tried to move with the times – you can find it on Face­book, In­sta­gram and Carousell. Still, an old-school charm lingers.</p>
    <p>Shelves be­hind the counter are crammed with about 10,000 in­dex cards with cus­tomers’ mem­ber­ship de­tails. Only a few hun­dred are still ac­tive, Madam Khoo says.</p>
    <p>She pulls out one card dat­ing back to 1996. “It still has a bal­ance, so we can’t can­cel the mem­ber­ship or re­cy­cle the card num­ber. We just keep it.”</p>
    <p>Madam Khoo tries to watch at least one movie a day. She strug­gles to name her favourite – there are too many. But shop as­sis­tant Geraldine Chio, 30, looks up from the counter and chimes in: “She loves Kubo And The Two Strings. She has played it more than 200 times.”</p>
    <p>The store’s per­sonal touch, per­haps, is what keeps old cus­tomers com­ing back af­ter decades.</p>
    <p>“She al­ways asks, ‘What is your mood today?’” says Ms Teo, a re­tiree in her 60s who vis­its al­most ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>“I might say, ‘I’m de­pressed.’ And she’ll say, ‘Okay, you’ll see some­thing com­i­cal. It’s very homely.’ You feel you be­long,” adds Ms Teo, who was at the store last week to re­turn Dan­ish film The Hunt.</p>
    <p>Ar­chi­tect Ben­jamin Lee, 32, dis­cov­ered the shop a few months ago and was struck by its range of 4K Ul­tra HD and Blu-ray discs.</p>
    <p>“I don’t rent. I’m just a col­lec­tor,” he says, point­ing to his stack of films, such as Won­der Woman and Dead­pool 2, at the pay­ment counter.</p>
    <p>Then, there is 12-year-old Ray­den</p>
    <p>Lim, who pops by with his mother when­ever he goes for math­e­mat­ics tu­ition.</p>
    <p>“Rent­ing is a bet­ter so­lu­tion,” says the self-con­fessed film fa­natic, who has a $50 pre-paid pack­age en­ti­tling him to nine films. “If you buy, you have to watch the same movie over and over again.”</p>
    <p>Madam Khoo says: “Ev­ery video, ev­ery movie, tells a story. Life is a story – it’s how well we want to tell it.”</p>
    <p>The shop’s story be­gan in 1985. Madam Khoo and her late hus­band Mr Ooi met when they were col­leagues at an elec­tron­ics firm. They would watch gongfu movies in the cinema on date nights.</p>
    <p>Af­ter they were en­gaged, they took the plunge into the video busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“A lot of his friends were in the video busi­ness... Watch­ing movies is a great pas­time, if you ask me.”</p>
    <p>It was the golden age for video shops in Sin­ga­pore. In 1985, the is­land had more than 100 video li­braries and out­lets.</p>
    <p>Video­van, which would be­come the sole dis­trib­u­tor for 20th Cen­tury Fox and Dis­ney films in Sin­ga­pore, had set up shop not long ago. At D&O Film & Video in Tan­glin Shop­ping Cen­tre, crusty con­nois­seur Al­bert Odell held court.</p>
    <p>By the 1990s, the Oois had ex­panded their busi­ness, spilling into the next-door unit at Serene Cen­tre and set­ting up new branches at Or­chard Tow­ers, Bal­moral Plaza and Hol­land Vil­lage.</p>
    <p>Mr Ooi had the fore­sight to buy their units at Or­chard Tow­ers and Bal­moral Plaza, which are now leased to tenants and help gen­er­ate rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Rent­ing movies was a more af­ford­able op­tion for many peo­ple in the 1990s, when buy­ing a DVD would set one back about $80.</p>
    <p>Rida Video Cen­tre in Jalan Serene drew many ex­pa­tri­ates, but it was also pop­u­lar with the lo­cals. It saw more than 100 peo­ple a day, who rented ti­tles such as Monty Python and TVB dra­mas and carted off VHS cas­settes by the dozen.</p>
    <p>The late Mr Ooi, a self-made man who had a brush with gang cul­ture af­ter drop­ping out of pri­mary school, never al­lowed his poor English to get in the way of chat­ting with cus­tomers. He could of­ten be seen on a bench out­side the store, in con­ver­sa­tion with them.</p>
    <p>Shop as­sis­tant Alex, 47, who has been work­ing for Rida since the 1990s, says be­fore Googling ev­ery­thing be­came the norm, they had to rely on mem­ory to help peo­ple find what they were look­ing for.</p>
    <p>“Eh, I want to rent this movie, thriller, da** good,” a cus­tomer might say, re­call­ing only the name of an ac­tor or the out­lines of a scene.</p>
    <p>Fast-for­ward through the years and the rise of on­line stream­ing has sounded the death knell for giants in home video-re­tail­ing: HMV, Laser­flair, VideoEzy and TS Video.</p>
    <p>Rida has en­dured – for now. Today, it is l ucky if it sees 20 cus­tomers a day.</p>
    <p>Madam Khoo has also seen a fair share of chal­lenges this past decade.</p>
    <p>The first was Mr Ooi’s sud­den death from car­diac ar­rest in 2011 at the age of 50.</p>
    <p>An­other blow came in 2015, when Madam Khoo re­ceived word that Serene Cen­tre would be hik­ing up its rent, which led to Rida mov­ing to its cur­rent, much smaller premises.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker, they would have closed down if not for help from the Gov­ern­ment, says Madam Khoo, who is still ser­vic­ing the mort­gage on their unit in Coronation Shop­ping Plaza.</p>
    <p>She also hopes to see l ower li­cens­ing and movie-sub­mis­sion</p>
    <p>fees. Her li­cens­ing fees cost $3,000 for three years and clas­si­fi­ca­tion fees are $10 per half hour a film (th­ese have been waived amid the pan­demic).</p>
    <p>Ms Teo, mean­while, hopes things will be­come more lib­eral. Video shops in Sin­ga­pore are not al­lowed to sell R21 movies, such as Pulp Fic­tion and Call Me By Your Name.</p>
    <p>Brick-and-mor­tar video stores like Rida might seem like a dy­ing trade. But there will al­ways be peo­ple who want to rent movies, be it via DVDs or paid stream­ing, says the Sin­ga­pore Film So­ci­ety’s chair­man Ken­neth Tan, 55.</p>
    <p>Madam Khoo, who has four adult chil­dren, says she would like to spend more time with her grand­chil­dren – and one day hand over the reins to her staff or chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She adds: “If there’s a day when it drops to to­tally zero sales, then I might think it’s time to let go. But for now, I’d say not yet. We’ll see how it goes.”</p>
