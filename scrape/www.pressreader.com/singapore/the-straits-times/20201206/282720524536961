    <p>What’s old is new again. XO sauce, de­vel­oped in the 1980s in Hong Kong, has had some­thing of a resur­gence of late.</p>
    <p>In the last few years, more brands have en­tered the mar­ket, in­clud­ing those by restau­rants such as chicken rice chain Boon Tong Kee, seafood chain Jumbo and the Soup Restau­rant chain.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, home­made XO sauce came out of the wood­work, with home cooks sell­ing the lux­u­ri­ous condi­ment too.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times did a blind taste test of 14 brands from su­per­mar­kets, restau­rant chains and home­based food busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>These ranged in price from $6.80 for a 150g jar of Soup Restau­rant Sam­sui XO Sauce to $45 for a 250ml jar of XO Sauce from Lyn­nette’s Kitchen, the pri­vate din­ing busi­ness run by vi­o­lin­ist Lyn­nette Seah, for­mer co­con­cert mas­ter of the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Orches­tra.</p>
    <p>The best three turned out to be XO sauces made by home-based food busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>TA Kitchen, made by Malaysian Elaine Teh, was the top sauce; fol­lowed by the one from Lyn­nette’s Kitchen. Tied for third place were XO sauces by chef Will Chng, whose home-based food busi­ness is called Umami Boy, and Hong Kong brand Patchun.</p>
    <p>As­sess­ing the sauces were The Sun­day Times’ se­nior food cor­re­spon­dent Wong Ah Yoke; Ms Joanne Toh, co-owner of Wild­fire Chicken & Burg­ers in Ben­coolen Street; Mr Gooi Khai Shin, co-owner of soon-to-open 4am Pizza on Sen­tosa; and this writer. Ad­min­is­ter­ing the test at The Ori­en­tal­ist House in Gey­lang, the tast­ing room for spir­its com­pany The Ori­en­tal­ist, was Life in­tern Is­abel Kua.</p>
    <p>Mr Gooi, who makes his own XO sauce at home, said of the TA Kitchen sauce: “It’s very well-bal­anced, and the spice and su­gar are on point. The tex­ture is great.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, all the judges liked the touch of sweet­ness, and the punch­i­ness of the chilli, in the sauce.</p>
    <p>One gripe that the judges had about some of the other sauces was that they were not XO sauce in the strict sense of the word.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal, said to have been cre­ated at the Spring Moon restau­rant of the Penin­sula Hong Kong, is an umami bomb of a condi­ment made with dried scal­lops, fish, prawns, Jin­hua ham, dried and fresh chill­ies, onions and gar­lic. There is no brandy in it, although it is named af­ter XO or ex­tra old co­gnac. Rather, the name is meant to evoke lux­ury and pres­tige.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some of the sauces tested did not con­tain dried scal­lops. One of them was made up al­most en­tirely of an­chovies. Mr Wong said: “This would be great with nasi le­mak, but it’s not XO Sauce.”</p>
    <p>In­stead of pricey dried scal­lops, sev­eral man­u­fac­tur­ers loaded their sauces with dried shrimp or cut­tle­fish. Ms Toh said: “They are more like sam­bal sauces and would go well with chicken rice, nasi le­mak or as a dip for keropok.”</p>
    <p>“They shouldn’t be called XO sauce,” added Mr Wong. Sev­eral brands were much too salty and oth­ers, bland. One ap­peared not to have any salt at all.</p>
    <p>There was an­other sur­prise: All four judges liked the one veg­e­tar­ian XO sauce: SauceCo Veg­e­tar­ian XO Sauce, made in Tai­wan. In­stead of dried seafood and ham, it con­tains dried radish, miso, fer­mented black beans, mon­key head mush­rooms and toona leaves, which taste like gar­lic, chives and mus­tard greens when cooked.</p>
    <p>All of this, to­gether with a good hit of su­gar, re­minded the judges of the dried radish top­ping for ch­wee kueh or steamed rice flour cakes, com­mon in hawker cen­tres. Ms Toh said: “I’m im­pressed by this sauce. Even with­out the scal­lops, it has umami.”</p>
    <p>Of the win­ners, Mr Wong said: “The ones which have the best in­gre­di­ents came out tops. Lyn­nette Seah didn’t stint on the scal­lops and her sauce tastes authen­tic.”</p>
