    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>It is way too easy for you to spin out of con­trol. Try not to get too ex­cited about the news of the day as no one has all the facts yet.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You are deeply ide­al­is­tic, though you are usu­ally prac­ti­cal enough to fol­low up in ways that make sense.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Do not worry too much about what is go­ing on – there is at least one per­son who is hid­ing his or her real in­ten­tions.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>It is one of those days when work or the search for a job just is not as im­por­tant, so try to fo­cus on other needs.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Get all the de­tails be­fore you make a move. Oth­er­wise, things are sure to fall apart once new data starts to trickle in.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You may find it eas­ier to pick things apart than to build them up, but re­sist the urge un­less it seems ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You feel a bit out of sorts – not quite sick, not quite de­pressed, but cer­tainly not at your best. Things should be great in a day or two.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Con­flict is not such a bad thing – it can end up strength­en­ing both sides and that is good for the group as a whole.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your fru­gal­ity saves the day.</p>
    <p>You may have a few ex­tra bucks re­served for an emer­gency or leave a good im­pres­sion on some­one.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You should see a dis­tinct im­prove­ment in your sit­u­a­tion – so much so that you may won­der how things got to be so good.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>This is not a good day for strug­gle – even if things seem un­fair, you just end up get­ting in deeper if you push too hard.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your col­leagues re­quire some new di­rec­tion quickly and you need to reach out to them in a way that they can ap­pre­ci­ate.</p>
