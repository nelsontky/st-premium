    <p>It has been a long week for in­vestors, but at least it ended on a more up­beat note with the mar­ket inch­ing up af­ter four days of de­cline.</p>
    <p>The slightly bet­ter mood – helped by ro­bust re­sults on Wall Street overnight – nudged the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex up 0.62 points, or 0.02 per cent, to close at 2,528.54.</p>
    <p>Gain­ers out­num­bered de­clin­ers 247 to 163, with 1.91 bil­lion shares worth $1.23 bil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>The top gainer for the day was Hongkong Land, which added 2.93 per cent to close at US$3.86.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank ended the week in the red, with the big­gest de­cline – down 1.81 per cent – to $8.67 as it went ex-div­i­dend. The bank has an­nounced its first sus­tain­able fi­nance trans­ac­tion in South Korea.</p>
    <p>It said it has pro­vided a green loan of 115 bil­lion won (S$132 mil­lion) to M&G Real Es­tate Asia to re­fi­nance an in­vest­ment in North­gate, a green build­ing in cen­tral Seoul.</p>
    <p>The loan is the coun­try’s first green loan sup­port­ing the prop­erty sec­tor, said OCBC, which is also look­ing to grow its sus­tain­able fi­nance port­fo­lio to $25 bil­lion by 2025.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank and DBS Bank shares closed up.</p>
    <p>UOB gained 0.2 per cent to $19.92, while DBS inched up 0.048 per cent to $20.73.</p>
    <p>Asian mar­kets also re­bounded from Thurs­day’s de­cline, with Wall Street un­der­pin­ning much of the op­ti­mism around the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Nas­daq closed at a record high overnight, while the S&P 500 and Dow also rose as gains in heavy­weight tech stocks such as Ap­ple out­weighed down­beat data that af­firmed the Fed­eral Re­serve’s view that a dif­fi­cult road to eco­nomic re­cov­ery lies ahead.</p>
    <p>The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo edged up 0.17 per cent, while hopes of a vac­cine helped send Shang­hai shares up 0.5 per cent and lifted Shen­zhen, China’s sec­ond ex­change, by 1.09 per cent.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi climbed 1.34 per cent af­ter data showed that the coun­try’s ex­ports fell in sin­gle dig­its in the first 20 days of this month, in­di­cat­ing signs of re­cov­ery from the fall­out of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian shares had a tur­bu­lent week and closed down 0.14 per cent for the day and 0.2 per cent un­der for the week – the first weekly fall in three weeks.</p>
    <p>That limp fin­ish came af­ter the in­dex hit a six-month high ear­lier in the week on the back of en­cour­ag­ing cor­po­rate re­sults.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shot up 1.3 per cent yes­ter­day thanks to in­vestors tar­get­ing tech and con­sumer com­pa­nies, but the mar­ket was down a touch for the week.</p>
