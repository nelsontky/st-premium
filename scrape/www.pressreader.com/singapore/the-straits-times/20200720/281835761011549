    <p>LONDON • China will re­spond res­o­lutely to any at­tempt by Bri­tain to sanc­tion Chi­nese of­fi­cials fol­low­ing the im­po­si­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong, its am­bas­sador in London said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Bri­tain in­tro­duced a new sanc­tions regime to tar­get in­di­vid­u­als it says are in­volved in hu­man rights abuses or or­gan­ised crime.</p>
    <p>Some law­mak­ers in Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s Con­ser­va­tive Party have said the sanc­tions should be used to tar­get Chi­nese of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>“If UK gov­ern­ment goes that far to im­pose sanc­tions on any in­di­vid­ual in China, China will cer­tainly make a res­o­lute re­sponse to it,” Mr Liu Xiaom­ing told the BBC’s An­drew Marr Show yes­ter­day. “You’ve seen what hap­pens in the United States – they sanc­tion Chi­nese of­fi­cials, we sanc­tion their sen­a­tors, their of­fi­cials. I do not want to see this tit-for-tat hap­pen in... China-UK re­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab told the same pro­gramme he would not be drawn on fu­ture ad­di­tions to Bri­tain’s sanc­tions list, but he de­nied that Bri­tain would be too weak to chal­lenge China through this chan­nel.</p>
    <p>Mr Raab said he would up­date Bri­tain’s Par­lia­ment to out­line fur­ther mea­sures on Hong Kong and China to­day.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain says China’s new law for the city breaches agree­ments made be­fore the 1997 han­dover and that China is crush­ing the free­doms that have helped make the ter­ri­tory one of the world’s big­gest fi­nan­cial hubs.</p>
    <p>Mr Raab also said yes­ter­day that it was clear the Uighur mi­nor­ity in China had suf­fered abuses of their hu­man rights. “It is clear that there are gross, egre­gious hu­man rights abuses go­ing on, which is why in Geneva at the UN, we raised this with 27 part­ners... to call out the gov­ern­ment of China for its hu­man rights abuses of the Uighurs, also of Hong Kong,” he said.</p>
