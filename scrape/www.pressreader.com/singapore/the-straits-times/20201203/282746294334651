    <p>• A lawyer for Bill Cosby (right) on Tues­day told the Penn­syl­va­nia Supreme Court that the judge at the en­ter­tainer’s 2018 sex­ual as­sault trial should have barred five pros­e­cu­tion wit­nesses who tes­ti­fied that Cosby had also drugged and raped them.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, the once-pop­u­lar co­me­dian and ac­tor was found guilty of drug­ging and rap­ing a one-time friend, Ms An­drea Con­stand, at his home near Philadel­phia in 2004.</p>
    <p>He is serv­ing a three- to 10-year sen­tence in a state prison near Philadel­phia.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing on Tues­day took place about a year af­ter a lower ap­pel­late court re­jected a pe­ti­tion by Cosby, now 83, to have his con­vic­tion over­turned.</p>
    <p>At the 2018 trial, pros­e­cu­tors called five women to t he stand to show that Cosby had a pat­tern of be­friend­ing younger women with prom­ises of ca­reer help and then drug­ging and rap­ing them.</p>
    <p>The five women who tes­ti­fied were among more than 50 who have made sim­i­lar al­le­ga­tions against Cosby since the 1960s.</p>
    <p>Cosby’s lawyer, Ms Jen­nifer Bon­jean, ar­gued the com­plaints of the five were too dis­sim­i­lar to those of Ms Con­stand to be ad­mis­si­ble as ev­i­dence of prior “bad acts”.</p>
    <p>Un­like the other women, Ms Bon­jean said, Cosby had an 18-month re­la­tion­ship with Ms Con­stand and even met her mother.</p>
    <p>At least one of the seven Supreme Court jus­tices, Ms Chris­tine Dono­hue, ap­peared scep­ti­cal of the pros­e­cu­tion’s ar­gu­ments about the rel­e­vance of the women’s tes­ti­mony.</p>
    <p>Ms Adri­enne Jappe, who ar­gued the case for the Mont­gomery County dis­trict at­tor­ney, said it was a mis­per­cep­tion that Cosby had only a brief re­la­tion­ship with the five women, say­ing he had ex­tended re­la­tion­ships with at least some of them.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing was con­ducted vir­tu­ally due to coro­n­avirus con­cerns and Cosby did not ap­pear on­screen dur­ing the pro­ceed­ings.</p>
