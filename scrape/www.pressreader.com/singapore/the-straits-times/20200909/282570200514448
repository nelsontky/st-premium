    <p>HONG KONG • If you want to keep your son’s In­sta­gram ac­count away from pry­ing eyes, it is bet­ter not to fol­low it.</p>
    <p>That seems to be the les­son learnt by Hong Kong ac­tress Ce­cilia Cheung, who in­ad­ver­tently re­vealed the han­dle of her eldest son, Lu­cas, on Sun­day, when she fol­lowed his In­sta­gram ac­count.</p>
    <p>Lu­cas, 13, is her son with ac­tor-singer Ni­cholas Tse and the cou­ple have a younger son Quin­tus, who is 10. Cheung and Tse di­vorced in 2011 af­ter a five-year mar­riage.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old ac­tress has a third son, Mar­cus, who was born in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Lu­cas used a photo of him­self wink­ing and us­ing his hand to cover part of his face as his pro­file photo, with ne­ti­zens say­ing that he looks like his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>In his bio, he used the quote: “The pos­i­tive thinker sees the in­vis­i­ble, feels the in­tan­gi­ble and achieves the im­pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Cheung has since un­fol­lowed her son’s ac­count af­ter his user­name was re­ported widely in the me­dia. Lu­cas’ ac­count is also un­search­able on In­sta­gram. But she has writ­ten posts on and put up videos of him and his brothers on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>In a post wish­ing Lu­cas happy birthday last month, Cheung posted a we­fie with him with his eyes closed and an­other of their hands to­gether on his 13th birthday on Aug 2.</p>
    <p>She also posted a photo of Quin­tus when he turned 10 in May and an­other photo of her to­gether with her three sons.</p>
