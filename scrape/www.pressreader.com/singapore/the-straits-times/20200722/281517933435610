    <p>With a dead­line loom­ing, signs emerged that the much-de­layed Jo­hor Baru-Singapore Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS) Link project could soon be back on track, though the Singapore au­thor­i­ties in­di­cated that cer­tain details still needed to be ironed out.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries will ink agree­ments to fi­nalise the project on July 30, Malaysian Trans­port Min­is­ter Wee Ka Siong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added that both coun­tries have com­pleted dis­cus­sions on the cross-border project, announced in 2010, and will sign three agree­ments to clinch the deal.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Wee told a news con­fer­ence held in Par­lia­ment in Kuala Lumpur that the sign­ing cer­e­mony will take place on July 30 at the Cause­way, and will be wit­nessed by the prime min­is­ters of both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Singapore’s Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for In­fra­struc­ture and Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan said on his Face­book page that a fi­nal extension had been granted un­til the end of this month to re­view some changes that Malaysia had pro­posed.</p>
    <p>“Six months of in­ten­sive dis­cus­sions, meeting al­most daily, of­ten late into the night, via tele­con­fer­ence in re­cent months, have come to a close,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Khaw, who is re­tir­ing from pol­i­tics, said there is now an agreed text on the changes to the project, for pre­sen­ta­tion to both gov­ern­ments for ap­proval. “We are now dis­cussing the venue of the event to mark the restart of the project,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Singapore’s Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) said the two coun­tries have been in in­ten­sive dis­cus­sions on the re­sump­tion of the RTS Link project. “We are work­ing to­wards con­clud­ing all the three key agree­ments which need to be signed by July 31 for the project to re­sume,” it added.</p>
    <p>The three key agree­ments re­fer to the RTS Link Bi­lat­eral Agree­ment be­tween the two gov­ern­ments, the joint ven­ture agree­ment be­tween SMRT Cor­po­ra­tion and Prasarana Malaysia to con­sti­tute a joint ven­ture op­er­at­ing com­pany, and a con­ces­sion agree­ment for the two gov­ern­ments to ap­point this op­er­at­ing com­pany as the RTS Link op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>The 4km RTS Link will con­nect Wood­lands North MRT sta­tion on Singapore’s Thom­son-East Coast Line to Bukit Chagar, a planned el­e­vated ter­mi­nal in Jo­hor Baru.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent KTM shut­tle train ser­vice will cease op­er­a­tions within six months af­ter the RTS Link be­comes op­er­a­tional.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries had ac­knowl­edged that there was a need to al­le­vi­ate traf­fic con­ges­tion at the Jo­hor Baru-Singapore Cause­way, which fa­cil­i­tates about 300,000 cross­ings daily.</p>
    <p>Singapore pre­vi­ously said the RTS Link has a ca­pac­ity of 10,000 com­muters at peak pe­ri­ods, ev­ery hour and in one di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee con­firmed yes­ter­day that it will be based on the Light Rapid Tran­sit sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion work for the RTS</p>
    <p>Link is slated to be­gin in Jan­uary next year, he added, and the rail link is ex­pected to be­gin op­er­a­tions at end-2026.</p>
    <p>He said the project is es­ti­mated to cost around RM3.7 bil­lion (S$1.21 bil­lion), which in­cludes land ac­qui­si­tion and the cost of re­lo­cat­ing a main­te­nance and op­er­a­tion de­pot orig­i­nally planned for Mandai to Jo­hor Baru in­stead.</p>
    <p>Malaysia had announced in May that the dead­line for the project was ex­tended by three months to July 31 due to the coro­n­avirus and move­ment con­trol curbs.</p>
    <p>The Singapore Govern­ment said it was the third and fi­nal extension.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial tar­get date for project com­ple­tion was Dec 31, 2024.</p>
