    <p>MEL­BOURNE Vic­to­ri­ans risk a fine if they are caught wear­ing face cov­er­ings other than a fit­ted mask af­ter 11.59pm to­day, when a two-week grace pe­riod for the Aus­tralian state’s new mask change ex­pires.</p>
    <p>Ban­danas, scarves and face shields will no longer be “suf­fi­cient”, said Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel An­drews. “Scarves and ban­danas in the early stages was an ap­pro­pri­ate re­sponse,” he was quoted as say­ing by 9News on Fri­day. “That ad­vice is now changed. We have given the two-week pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“All Vic­to­ri­ans must wear fit­ted masks when they l eave their homes,” he said. “As re­stric­tions ease and move­ment in­creases, the ef­fec­tive­ness of masks is even more im­por­tant and ob­vi­ous.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia recorded no coro­n­avirus deaths for a third straight day yes­ter­day, but its hot spot city of Mel­bourne in Vic­to­ria faced a pro­longed lock­down as new in­fec­tions stayed stub­bornly above the tar­get for re-open­ing.</p>
    <p>The na­tion­wide tally ex­ceeds 27,200 in­fec­tions and 897 deaths.</p>
    <p>The south-east­ern state of Vic­to­ria re­ported 14 new cases, tak­ing the two-week av­er­age up slightly to 9.5, dou­ble the tar­get of fewer than five set for eas­ing curbs in its cap­i­tal of Mel­bourne in eight days’ time, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>Once the tar­get was met, the state govern­ment had said, it would lift all re­stric­tions on leav­ing home, as well as per­mit­ting pub­lic gath­er­ings of up to 10 peo­ple, some house­hold vis­its, out­door din­ing and the re­open­ing of all shops.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews dashed hopes for a broad eas­ing, how­ever.</p>
    <p>“I think it is un­likely that we will be able to take as big steps as we would have hoped to take next Sun­day,” he told a tele­vised news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>He de­clined, how­ever, to com­ment on what curbs might be lifted.</p>
    <p>“There’s no short­cuts here, oth­er­wise we will have lit­er­ally five min­utes of sun­shine and we’ll be pin­balling back and forth in and out of re­stric­tions all sum­mer and all 2021,” he said.</p>
