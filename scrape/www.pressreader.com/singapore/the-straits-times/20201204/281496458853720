    <p>The world knows Mr Piyush Gupta as the banker who leads the best bank on the globe.</p>
    <p>De­scribed as a pro­gres­sive leader who led DBS’ trans­for­ma­tion from a do­mes­tic bank into a global pres­ence on the back of its strong Asian net­work, he ex­udes con­fi­dence at pub­lic events.</p>
    <p>And yet, for about a year af­ter his start-up ven­ture Go4i.com failed in 2000, he strug­gled with men­tal well­ness.</p>
    <p>“My dot-com failed and I was left in limbo with big life de­ci­sions. I went through a pe­riod of acute anx­i­ety. I shut down my start-up, and was try­ing to fig­ure what to do with my life,” he tells The Straits Times via e-mail.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that pe­riod, he says, “the key thing that I em­braced then was med­i­ta­tion. This had been a god­send to me, and I have med­i­tated ever since”.</p>
    <p>That episode was the first of two men­tal health is­sues he faced per­son­ally in his ca­reer. The sec­ond hap­pened around three to four years ago when he had acute in­som­nia for sev­eral days.</p>
    <p>He says: “In both cases, I had med­i­cal as­sis­tance, which helped sort out the prob­lem. My learn­ing from th­ese episodes is that the hu­man brain is dif­fi­cult to con­trol, and can some­times act up.</p>
    <p>“The best is to recog­nise that this is a med­i­cal con­di­tion, just like other phys­i­cal ail­ments, and seek ap­pro­pri­ate help.</p>
    <p>“I also learnt that peo­ple are of­ten wary of talk­ing about this, be­cause of a pre­sumed stigma. How­ever, the more open you are, the eas­ier it be­comes to deal with the is­sue.”</p>
    <p>Those episodes helped hone his lead­er­ship style to fo­cus more on em­pa­thy. Mr Gupta, 60, joined</p>
    <p>DBS Bank in 2009 and was named CEO of the year last year by The Dig­i­tal Banker at its Global Re­tail Bank­ing In­no­va­tion Awards.</p>
    <p>He is the sec­ond Sin­ga­pore leader to speak pub­licly about his per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ences with men­tal health is­sues in a week.</p>
    <p>Last week, Mr Chng Kai Fong, 41, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Sin­ga­pore’s in­vest­ment pro­mo­tions agency, the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB), spoke about his men­tal health strug­gles dur­ing a vir­tual tech con­fer­ence in re­marks picked up by Bloomberg news agency.</p>
    <p>A series of events pushed him to the edge this year. A can­cer di­ag­no­sis, and a death, in the fam­ily hap­pened close to­gether. And a close fam­ily mem­ber strug­gles with se­ri­ous men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>As he shared at the con­fer­ence: “There was this feel­ing of heat and anger start­ing with palms and then sort of moves to­wards your en­tire body. There was one day when I couldn’t even wake up; I had to re­ally drag my­self out at 11.30 and go for a run be­cause I knew th­ese were signs of de­pres­sive bouts. Even dur­ing the run, I was su­per breath­less. It was a bad sign.” He sought help, to­gether with fam­ily mem­bers, to work through the chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore’s hard-driv­ing cul­ture, show­ing signs of vul­ner­a­bil­ity is a risk. De­spite know­ing that de­trac­tors may use such dis­clo­sures to di­min­ish his fu­ture lead­er­ship po­ten­tial, Mr Chng told The Straits Times this week why he chose to go pub­lic with his ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“This year has been so tough for many of us, with Covid-19 forc­ing us to work and live dif­fer­ently and caus­ing un­prece­dented pres­sures.</p>
    <p>“You read the re­ports of ris­ing di­vorce, ris­ing men­tal health stress of mid­dle man­agers, peo­ple be­ing hos­pi­talised, stresses over school­ing.</p>
    <p>“I can’t be the only one fac­ing th­ese chal­lenges. I fig­ured if the guy at the top speaks about it, per­mis­sion is given to all down the line to do so.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the per­sonal chal­lenges, Mr Chng has led EDB to a rous­ing year – it at­tracted about</p>
    <p>$14.3 bil­lion in fixed-as­set in­vest­ments – which is 95 per cent of the in­vest­ment com­mit­ments for the whole of last year. He at­tributes this to hav­ing “a very good team” in a col­le­gial or­gan­i­sa­tion where peo­ple re­late as friends, not just co-work­ers.</p>
    <p>Many col­leagues, busi­ness part­ners here and over­seas, and other “se­nior peo­ple” have opened up to him about their is­sues af­ter his pub­lic dis­clo­sure.</p>
    <p>He says that within EDB, “it’s early days yet, but the con­ver­sa­tions are start­ing, and we’re look­ing to see how we can sup­port our staff bet­ter through coun­selling, bet­ter men­tal well­ness sup­port”.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Chng, Mr Gupta has pri­ori­tised men­tal well­ness in his or­gan­i­sa­tion, be­liev­ing that em­ploy­ers have to be proac­tive about cre­at­ing an en­vi­ron­ment where men­tal stresses and strains are pre-empted.</p>
    <p>He said: “That is why through the pan­demic, we at DBS placed the great­est im­por­tance on man­ag­ing staff spir­its. We cre­ated a pro­gramme called To­gether, un­der which we had sev­eral themes: ca­sual get-to­geth­ers on­line, vir­tual cel­e­bra­tions and par­ties and on­line learn­ing pro­grammes with gam­i­fi­ca­tion.” There are also we­bi­nars on mind­ful­ness and a mind­ful­ness app for staff.</p>
    <p>SENSE OF UR­GENCY</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 rages across the world, men­tal health is­sues are be­ing pushed from the “im­por­tant, but not ur­gent” quad­rant to the “im­por­tant and ur­gent” quad­rant of is­sues, says former Nom­i­nated MP Anthea Ong, a men­tal health ac­tivist who started the WorkWell Lead­ers Work­group to cham­pion men­tal health as a strate­gic pri­or­ity at the work­place.</p>
    <p>More bosses are com­ing on board the men­tal health agenda, she says, adding that 52 of them are tak­ing part in a we­bi­nar this morn­ing to share best prac­tices, the third such ses­sion since the group was set up in 2018. Mr Gupta had shared about his ex­pe­ri­ence in this closed-door group in July.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has brought men­tal health is­sues to the fore.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions warned in May of a loom­ing global men­tal health cri­sis as a re­sult of iso­la­tion, poverty and anx­i­ety caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A Mercer re­port found that 36 per cent of re­spon­dents said em­ploy­ees work­ing re­motely are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing men­tal health is­sues due to so­cial iso­la­tion and eco­nomic anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>An April study by hu­man re­sources com­pany Pro­file Asia found that 44 per cent of those work­ing in Sin­ga­pore re­ported that Covid-19 had ad­versely af­fected their men­tal health.</p>
    <p>It is not hard to see why: Lock­downs and forced quar­an­tines re­move per­sonal free­doms and up­set daily rou­tines like work, ex­er­cise and go­ing out with friends that give peo­ple a sense of or­der and au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home is iso­lat­ing for those liv­ing alone. Oth­ers liv­ing with fam­ily face over­crowd­ing and loss of per­sonal space and time, bal­anc­ing care­giv­ing and work.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has blurred the dis­tinc­tion be­tween home and work­place. Where pre­vi­ously peo­ple went to work and left their per­sonal or fam­ily strug­gles at home, work­ing from home means those is­sues be­come vis­i­ble and front and cen­tre to col­leagues and bosses.</p>
    <p>RE­DUC­ING STIGMA</p>
    <p>In that sense, the pan­demic may of­fer an op­por­tu­nity to fi­nally achieve what decades of men­tal health ad­vo­cacy have failed to do: Nor­malise ac­cep­tance of and sup­port for men­tal health con­di­tions at the work­place.</p>
    <p>While most em­ploy­ers have strong ben­e­fits and sup­port sys­tems for those with phys­i­cal ill­ness, men­tal ill­ness tends to be treated dif­fer­ently and dis­crim­i­nated against.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it was only in Jan­uary that it was re­ported that tri­par­tite guide­lines were is­sued mak­ing it dis­crim­i­na­tory to ask job ap­pli­cants to de­clare their men­tal health con­di­tions with­out good rea­son.</p>
    <p>Last month, a tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on men­tal well-be­ing at work­places was is­sued. It sug­gests that em­ploy­ers ap­point men­tal well­ness cham­pi­ons; pro­vide ac­cess to coun­selling ser­vices; train man­agers to spot signs of men­tal dis­tress; and have a work-life har­mony pol­icy to pro­vide clar­ity on af­ter-hours work com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced the set­ting up of an in­ter-agency Covid-19 Men­tal Well­ness Task­force to re­view and co­or­di­nate the na­tional re­sponse to men­tal health needs aris­ing from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Such at­ten­tion from the top is piv­otal to hav­ing men­tal health is­sues ac­knowl­edged and pro­vided for at the work­place.</p>
    <p>Ms Yo­hanna Ab­dul­lah, 53, is a re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion ex­ec­u­tive at non-profit Club Heal, where she runs expressive arts ther­apy and sup­port groups for peo­ple with men­tal ill­ness.</p>
    <p>She has lived with bipo­lar dis­or­der for 22 years, and says an un­der­stand­ing boss and col­leagues make a big dif­fer­ence to whether peo­ple with men­tal health is­sues can in­te­grate into the work­force.</p>
    <p>She says: “Men­tally ill peo­ple of­ten feel like they are not nor­mal and are stig­ma­tised. When the boss speaks openly on men­tal health is­sues, in­clud­ing their own, we feel more ac­cepted.</p>
    <p>“I have been very lucky to have em­ploy­ers who see what I can do de­spite my men­tal health con­di­tion, and col­leagues who sup­port me. Many of us can live and work pro­duc­tively with sup­port, just like ev­ery­body else.”</p>
    <p>Men­tal health prob­lems can be char­ac­terised as stig­ma­tised iden­ti­ties, which carry neg­a­tive traits peo­ple do not want to be as­so­ci­ated with. Thus, they do not dis­close their con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But when bosses re­veal their own strug­gles, they send a dif­fer­ent sig­nal to the or­gan­i­sa­tion, re­duc­ing the stigma. They also show one can live with a men­tal health prob­lem and be high-per­form­ing at work – just as some­one with a phys­i­cal ill­ness, say, di­a­betes, can ex­cel.</p>
    <p>This is im­por­tant in Sin­ga­pore’s con­text, where aware­ness and un­der­stand­ing of men­tal health is­sues re­main low.</p>
    <p>A 2016 study found that nearly nine in 10 em­ploy­ees with men­tal health con­di­tions never seek help be­cause of the stigma.</p>
    <p>A 2017 Pub­lic At­ti­tudes Sur­vey by the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice found that one in two peo­ple ad­mit­ted to hav­ing lit­tle knowl­edge of men­tal health con­di­tions. De­spite the lack of knowl­edge, four in 10 ex­pressed views like “Lack of dis­ci­pline and willpower is one of the main causes of men­tal health is­sues”, or “Per­sons with men­tal health is­sues should not be given re­spon­si­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>Such views spring from a mis­un­der­stand­ing of men­tal health is­sues that catas­trophises such con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>In fact, in Sin­ga­pore, one in seven peo­ple has ex­pe­ri­enced a men­tal health con­di­tion (de­fined as a mood, anx­i­ety or al­co­hol-use dis­or­der) in his life­time.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous stud­ies es­ti­mate that dur­ing this pan­demic, one-third to half of em­ploy­ees re­port de­te­ri­o­rat­ing men­tal health.</p>
    <p>In any case, most work­ers will face stress­ful pe­ri­ods in their lives – cop­ing with ill­ness of self or loved ones, death of fam­ily mem­bers, di­vorce, par­ent­ing is­sues, re­lo­ca­tion, change of jobs and other dis­rup­tions. Many would ben­e­fit from sup­port dur­ing th­ese pe­ri­ods to re­main op­ti­mal at work.</p>
    <p>Hu­man re­source pro­fes­sion­als say that hav­ing men­tal health is­sues openly ac­knowl­edged is good for the work­force. It al­lows work­ers to feel more sup­ported, which im­proves per­for­mance; gives or­gan­i­sa­tions a clearer pic­ture of the health of its hu­man cap­i­tal; and fos­ters greater trust.</p>
    <p>One of those who be­lieve strongly in the need to nor­malise ac­cep­tance of men­tal health is­sues is Mr Hsieh Fu Hua, 70, who chairs the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Board of Trustees, and has served as chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change and as pres­i­dent of Te­masek.</p>
    <p>He has long been an ad­vo­cate for this is­sue, af­ter see­ing his own chil­dren strug­gle with de­pres­sion. To bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate men­tal health chal­lenges and treat­ment, he went for psy­chother­apy around 2011 and found it use­ful in help­ing him gain self-aware­ness and un­der­stand­ing of his fam­ily’s sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>And when a beloved pet dog was bru­tally run over by a car be­fore his eyes in 2015, the re­sult­ing anger and flash­backs sent him to seek psy­chi­atric help.</p>
    <p>When he was put up for the post of United Over­seas Bank chair­man in 2013, he had to fill in a form which asked if he had sought men­tal health treat­ment. With­out hes­i­ta­tion, he an­swered “yes”.</p>
    <p>Re­count­ing the in­ci­dent, Mr Hsieh says: “The le­gal sec­re­tary was shocked. How can you de­clare such a thing? But I told them, I have to; it is true.”</p>
    <p>That dec­la­ra­tion did not cost him the chair­man post, and no one ever sug­gested that it might af­fect his abil­ity to per­form his du­ties.</p>
    <p>He muses: “Men­tal health is­sues are the scourge of our time. They re­main stig­ma­tised when it is hu­man and nat­u­ral for all of us to feel that we can­not cope with things. One has to con­stantly push so that men­tal health is­sues are ac­cepted and ac­knowl­edged.”</p>
    <p>He hopes to see the day men­tal ill­ness is treated the way phys­i­cal ill­ness is at the work­place: as a nat­u­ral part of life, and work­ers with th­ese con­di­tions are sup­ported in a way that lets them con­trib­ute fully.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, we are all sus­cep­ti­ble to coughs and colds and need time off. From time to time in life, we will need to care for our men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>“Many peo­ple live with chronic con­di­tions like hy­per­ten­sion and di­a­betes and are pro­duc­tive work­ers; sim­i­larly, peo­ple with men­tal health is­sues like de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety can re­main pro­duc­tive work­ers, with treat­ment and man­age­ment.”</p>
