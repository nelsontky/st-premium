    <p>As clam­p­downs on busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als breach­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures con­tinue, shop­ping malls are no ex­cep­tion to scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>En­try re­stric­tions may be im­posed on malls that face crowd man­age­ment is­sues even as more vis­i­tors are al­lowed in un­der phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions may be sim­i­lar to the “odd-even” week­end en­try in force at Penin­sula Plaza and Lucky Plaza since Aug 29.</p>
    <p>Un­der these guide­lines, pa­trons can visit the malls only on odd or even dates ac­cord­ing to whether the last digit of their NRIC/FIN num­ber is odd or even.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions re­main in place even though phase three has eased the ca­pac­ity limit for malls from 10 sq m to 8 sq m per per­son since Dec 28.</p>
    <p>When an­nounc­ing the mea­sures in Au­gust last year, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) said the two shop­ping cen­tres at­tracted larger crowds and longer queues to en­ter them over a sus­tained pe­riod, es­pe­cially on week­ends, com­pared with other malls.</p>
    <p>Penin­sula Plaza and Lucky Plaza are es­pe­cially pop­u­lar with Myan­mar and Filipino do­mes­tic work­ers, re­spec­tively, and many visit to meet friends and buy prod­ucts from home on Sun­days – a com­mon day off for these work­ers.</p>
    <p>But own­ers of busi­nesses re­liant on this niche clien­tele said they were strug­gling to make ends meet, with some point­ing out that they had failed to break even for months.</p>
    <p>Ms Jhen Ta­mayao, 49, who runs a busi­ness sell­ing Filipino beauty and food prod­ucts at Lucky Plaza, said her Sun­day tak­ings are now a mere $300, com­pared with about $1,500 to $2,000 be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>While crowds are thin at Penin­sula Plaza, for­eign work­ers still gather out­side the build­ing, cre­at­ing con­ges­tion, the mall’s man­age­ment told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ms Toe Tin­zar Oo, 41, who runs Myan­mar Khit, a con­ve­nience shop at Penin­sula Plaza, said she felt the re­stric­tions were im­prac­ti­cal as large crowds con­tin­ued to gather out­side the mall on Sun­days, thus not mit­i­gat­ing the risk of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>She added that she be­lieved the mall was ca­pa­ble of tak­ing in more vis­i­tors on week­ends while en­forc­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, and urged the au­thor­i­ties to lift re­stric­tions that had “caused great dis­tress to the shop own­ers who have suf­fered im­mea­sur­able losses”.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong K.S., 60, owner of eyewear shop Sys­tems Op­tics at the same mall, said that while he un­der­stood the need for re­stric­tions on Sun­days, he felt mea­sures could be lifted on Satur­days, which have typ­i­cally seen fewer pa­trons at the mall than on week­days even be­fore re­stric­tions were im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Lucky Plaza shop own­ers, who pre­vi­ously spoke to ST about the re­stric­tions in Septem­ber, said last week that they were at their wits’ end.</p>
    <p>Ap­peals for the re­stric­tions to be eased – in­clud­ing a pa­per pe­ti­tion signed by 167 shop­keep­ers – were ei­ther re­jected or unan­swered by the au­thor­i­ties, said Mr Ho Chee Yew, 45, who runs an eatery.</p>
    <p>STB and ESG said they will con­tinue to mon­i­tor and re­view safe man­age­ment mea­sures at the two malls.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of busi­nesses there have com­plied with the mea­sures, they added.</p>
    <p>“The health and safety of shop­pers and mall ten­ants re­main a key pri­or­ity, and STB and ESG will not hes­i­tate to take ap­pro­pri­ate en­force­ment ac­tion for non-com­pli­ance, which may in­clude fines, clo­sure of busi­ness or pros­e­cu­tion,” said the two agen­cies, while em­pha­sis­ing that the cur­rent re­stric­tions have kept busi­nesses open.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with both agen­cies yet to com­mit to a date when re­stric­tions will be eased, re­main­ing open may not be fea­si­ble for busi­nesses that have not bro­ken even for months.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Toe Tin­zar Oo: “We are try­ing to find a way to sur­vive. We also know the risks of Covid-19 and no­body wants to get it, but with­out in­come, how will we sur­vive?”</p>
    <p>Penin­sula Plaza and</p>
    <p>Lucky Plaza are es­pe­cially pop­u­lar with Myan­mar and Filipino do­mes­tic work­ers, re­spec­tively, and many visit to meet friends and buy prod­ucts from home on Sun­days...</p>
    <p>But own­ers of busi­nesses re­liant on this niche clien­tele said they were strug­gling to make ends meet.</p>
