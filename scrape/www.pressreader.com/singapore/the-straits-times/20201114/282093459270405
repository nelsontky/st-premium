    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has pre­sented po­ten­tial home buy­ers like Hong Konger Matthew Lai with an op­por­tu­nity to take a stab at the world’s most un­af­ford­able hous­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old pub­lic re­la­tions ex­ec­u­tive is tak­ing ad­van­tage of slightly softer home prices and low in­ter­est rates to re­alise his dream of be­com­ing a home owner.</p>
    <p>He is among scores of young Asian pro­fes­sion­als find­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in prob­lems cre­ated by the pan­demic and its en­su­ing eco­nomic un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>“I’m tak­ing ad­van­tage of this time to hunt for new prop­erty launches and in ar­eas I would con­sider liv­ing in,” says Mr Lai, who has given him­self un­til the end of next year to find a place.</p>
    <p>Own­ing a home in­stead of rent­ing is a goal for many in Hong Kong, and in Mr Lai’s case, he and his busi­ness con­sul­tant girl­friend, 27, have sta­ble jobs and fi­nances so they are not as stressed out about fork­ing out the down pay­ment for a 500 sq ft two-bed­der.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause I have some plan­ning, I have a lit­tle bit of in­vest­ments, so right now, I wouldn’t say I’m too wor­ried,” he says, adding that the cur­rent low in­ter­est-rate en­vi­ron­ment would also help re­duce mort­gage pay­ments.</p>
    <p>It seems oth­ers agree. Gov­ern­ment data showed Hong Kong pri­vate home prices have re­bounded af­ter de­clin­ing for sev­eral months, led by higher prices of medium-sized flats of be­tween 430 sq ft and 752 sq ft, re­ported RTHK late last month. Prices of pri­vate flats in Septem­ber added 0.3 per cent year on year, and were up by 0.4 per cent com­pared with Au­gust.</p>
    <p>In­deed, in a sign that Hong Kong home buy­ers may be seiz­ing the op­por­tu­nity pro­vided by cheaper bor­row­ing, the ra­tio of new mort­gage loans priced with ref­er­ence to the one-month Hi­bor – the Hong Kong dol­lar lend­ing rate – rose from 91.6 per cent in July to 92.9 per cent in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The one-month Hi­bor was at 0.13411 per cent on Wed­nes­day, around a multi-year low – a si­t­u­a­tion sim­i­lar in Malaysia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the av­er­age 30-year fixed mort­gage rate in Malaysia reached a record low of 3.09 per cent in Septem­ber, ac­cord­ing to fi­nan­cial ser­vices firm Bankrate’s weekly sur­vey of large lenders.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, the cen­tral bank’s rate of 2.25 per cent is at an all-time low, while mort­gage rates are also at multi-year lows.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong res­i­den­tial mar­ket has been fairly re­silient de­spite se­ri­ous eco­nomic reper­cus­sions due to the pan­demic, notes Mr Nel</p>
    <p>son Wong, head of re­search at global real es­tate ser­vices firm JLL in Greater China.</p>
    <p>“The well-doc­u­mented chronic lack of sup­ply and a gen­er­ally af­flu­ent so­ci­ety are key rea­sons sup­port­ing prices,” he says, adding that mass res­i­den­tial prices had dipped by only 0.2 per cent so far this year.</p>
    <p>Still, as com­pa­nies start to lay off staff and Hong Kong’s econ­omy re­mains in re­ces­sion, worries are grow­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Lai says: “For ex­am­ple, ca­reer pro­gres­sion is a lit­tle bit slowed down both for my­self and my girl­friend. It’s stress­ful in this pe­riod of time, but peo­ple are just try­ing to weather it.”</p>
    <p>Across the bor­der, the eco­nomic pres­sure from Covid-19 has caused some young Chi­nese to de­lay their home own­er­ship dreams.</p>
    <p>A poll of 1,705 Shang­hai res­i­dents found that more than half of those who had in­tended to buy a home this year have since ei­ther can­celled or put plans on hold, Chi­nese me­dia out­let ThePaper.cn re­ported in April. This was es­pe­cially true for younger re­spon­dents aged be­tween 21 and 30 years whose in­comes have fallen.</p>
    <p>Some oth­ers across the rest of Asia share sim­i­lar con­cerns but take the plunge any­way.</p>
    <p>“We were wor­ried (about mort­gage pay­ments), es­pe­cially with talks of a busi­ness shut­down,” says Filipino con­tent writer Aze Gedalanga, 37. To­gether with his 34-year-old wife Lala, who is in sales, he put a down pay­ment on a house south of Manila in April.</p>
    <p>For a mid­dle-in­come fam­ily like his, home own­er­ship still takes prece­dence over many other con­cerns, with or with­out a pan­demic, Mr Gedalanga says.</p>
    <p>“We had al­ready saved up for it, and my wife and I are in a sta­ble in</p>
    <p>I’m tak­ing ad­van­tage of this time to hunt for new prop­erty launches and in ar­eas I would con­sider liv­ing in... Be­cause I have some plan­ning, I have a lit­tle bit of in­vest­ments, so right now, I wouldn’t say I’m too wor­ried.</p>
    <p>a pub­lic re­la­tions ex­ec­u­tive who is cap­i­tal­is­ing on slightly softer home prices and low in­ter­est rates to look for a home in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>dus­try any­way,” he adds.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, home prices shot up 27 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, led by ro­bust de­mand for high-end units. An­a­lysts say Chi­nese buy­ers have been wait­ing in the wings for op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>In Malaysia, where na­tional prop­erty de­mand has fallen 2.5 per cent year on year, ac­coun­tant Eileen Tan re­cently snagged a 2,200 sq ft ter­raced house for RM560,000 (S$183,000) in De­nai Alam, Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>“This is the best time to shop for a house as the mar­ket is soft and the in­ter­est rate is also low. Mine is only at 3.14 per cent, com­pared with the usual 4.25 per cent,” says Ms Tan, 29. “I bought my first prop­erty 25 per cent cheaper than the ini­tial price as the owner was des­per­ate to get rid of it.”</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal price tag on the house, which she bought in June, was RM750,000.</p>
    <p>The state of Johor has recorded Malaysia’s high­est prop­erty over­hang and a sharp 22.8 per cent de­crease in de­mand.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor was the only ma­jor state to see a rise in hous­ing de­mand, up 3.5 per cent year on year for sub­sale res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties, due to af­ford­able units in Klang Val­ley’s sub­ur­ban ar­eas.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, the pan­demic ap­pears to have spurred grow­ing in­ter­est in cheaper homes out­side Tokyo, fa­cil­i­tated by a rise in tele­work ar­range­ments and a de­sire for more space.</p>
    <p>A Cabi­net Of­fice sur­vey in June re­vealed that 35.4 per cent of youth in their 20s who live in the 23 wards com­pris­ing cen­tral Tokyo were keen to move.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment, with an eye on ru­ral re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion, is also sup­port­ing the trend with sub­si­dies for peo­ple and com­pa­nies re­lo­cat­ing from Tokyo.</p>
    <p>“With the Covid-19 pan­demic, peo­ple are spend­ing more time at home than be­fore, and this has led to ris­ing pop­u­lar­ity in larger apart­ments or de­tached houses, in­stead of cramped apart­ments with poor noise ven­ti­la­tion,” Mr Yoichi Ike­moto, chief ed­i­tor of hous­ing web­site Su­umo, tells The Straits Times. in China, Raul Dan­cel in the Philip­pines and Wal­ter Sim in Ja­pan</p>
