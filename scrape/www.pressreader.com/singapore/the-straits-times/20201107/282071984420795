    <p>Long queues snaked out­side the Miller Park sta­dium in Mil­wau­kee, Wis­con­sin, this week, but the vis­i­tors were not there to catch a base­ball game.</p>
    <p>Since Oct 19, the park­ing area at the home of the Mil­wau­kee Brewers base­ball team has been used as the main Covid-19 test­ing site in the city.</p>
    <p>This pho­to­graph, show­ing the queue on Thurs­day, was shot with a drone and has been ro­tated 90 de­grees.</p>
    <p>The drive-through test­ing site, which can ad­min­is­ter about 2,000 tests a day, saw some of its busiest days this week.</p>
    <p>A lo­cal news out­let re­ported that 2,411 peo­ple were tested there on Mon­day, while some peo­ple were turned away be­cause the site was over ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Tues­day also saw a large turnout, with staff warn­ing of a 21/ hour</p>
    <p>2 wait­ing time 30 min­utes or so af­ter test­ing be­gan at 11am, a lo­cal news site re­ported.</p>
    <p>The site tested 2,382 peo­ple on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The city’s health de­part­ment said it is con­sid­er­ing in­creas­ing the test­ing ca­pac­ity at Miller Park.</p>
    <p>There are also plans to open the site for test­ing on Satur­days soon. It is cur­rently open only from Mon­days to Fri­days.</p>
    <p>Mil­wau­kee has two smaller com­mu­nity test­ing sites which can each test about 400 peo­ple a day.</p>
