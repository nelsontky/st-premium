    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • The Kuala Lumpur High Court yesterday or­dered former Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak to set­tle RM1.69 bil­lion (S$555 mil­lion) in un­paid taxes ac­cu­mu­lated over seven years while he was still in of­fice.</p>
    <p>High Court Judge Ah­mad Bache said in his sum­mary judg­ment that former pre­miers are not ex­empted from pay­ing tax and that Na­jib must pay his “debt” to the gov­ern­ment, ac­cord­ing to na­tional news agency Ber­nama.</p>
    <p>A sum­mary judg­ment is when a court makes its de­ci­sion without go­ing to a full trial.</p>
    <p>“This court holds that a sum­mary judg­ment is en­tered against the de­fen­dant for the amount claimed by the plain­tiff as in the plain­tiff’s state­ment of claims, that is, RM1,692,872,924.83 with cost,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>The court also fixed RM15,000 in costs.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment, through the In­land Rev­enue Board (IRB), filed the suit in June last year to re­cover un­paid taxes be­tween 2011 and 2017 to­talling RM1,692,872,924.83 from Na­jib, plus penal­ties and in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The next month, Na­jib filed an ap­pli­ca­tion to stay the pro­ceed­ings of the main suit pend­ing an ap­peal on the tax as­sess­ment to the IRB, but it was dis­missed, re­sult­ing in a hear­ing of sub­mis­sion for sum­mary judg­ment.</p>
    <p>Na­jib is also fac­ing sev­eral cor­rup­tion tri­als linked to state in­vest­ment fund 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB).</p>
    <p>The first trial, re­lated to funds mis­ap­pro­pri­ated from SRC In­ter­na­tional, a former sub­sidiary of 1MDB, closed early last month, with the ver­dict set for next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The 1MDB scan­dal has sparked global in­ves­ti­ga­tions into cor­rup­tion and money laun­der­ing, with prose­cu­tors es­ti­mat­ing US$4.5 bil­lion (S$6.2 bil­lion) was si­phoned from the Malaysian in­vest­ment fund. Na­jib has has de­nied all wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Na­jib was ousted as premier in the 2018 elec­tion that saw Malaysians ral­ly­ing over the 1MDB scan­dal and the high cost of liv­ing. That led to the coun­try’s first change of gov­ern­ment since its in­de­pen­dence and a crack­down against those in­volved in the 1MDB case.</p>
    <p>Na­jib’s Umno party un­ex­pect­edly re­turned to power in a coali­tion led by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin nearly five months ago, although Na­jib no longer leads the party.</p>
