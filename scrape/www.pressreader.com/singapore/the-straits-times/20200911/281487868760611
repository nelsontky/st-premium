    <p>In its lat­est and most dras­tic mea­sure to deal with op­er­a­tions bat­tered by the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Singapore Air­lines (SIA) Group said yes­ter­day that it has de­cided to cut around 4,300 po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the num­ber of em­ploy­ees im­pacted by the ex­er­cise may be fewer – per­haps around 2,400 – as mea­sures such as a re­cruit­ment freeze, nat­u­ral at­tri­tion and vol­un­tary de­par­ture schemes may cush­ion the blow.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of those af­fected are for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other ma­jor in­ter­na­tional air­lines such as Qatar Air­ways and United Air­lines have al­ready an­nounced sig­nif­i­cant job cuts, with the Covid-19 pan­demic wip­ing out de­mand for in­ter­na­tional air travel.</p>
    <p>The SIA Group said: “This de­ci­sion was taken in the light of the long road to re­cov­ery for the global air­line in­dus­try due to the de­bil­i­tat­ing im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic, and the ur­gent need for the group’s air­lines to adapt to an un­cer­tain fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Staff from SIA, SilkAir and Scoot were told of the move at vir­tual meet­ings yes­ter­day evening, be­fore the de­ci­sion was made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The SIA Group said it ex­pects to op­er­ate at less than 50 per cent of its ca­pac­ity at the end of the fi­nan­cial year in March next year, as com­pared with the lev­els be­fore the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic. It is cur­rently op­er­at­ing at only 8 per cent of its usual ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The group said: “Rel­a­tive to most ma­jor air­lines in the world, the SIA Group is in an even more vul­ner­a­ble po­si­tion as it does not have a do­mes­tic mar­ket that will be the first to see a re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to re­main vi­able in this un­cer­tain land­scape, the group’s air­lines will op­er­ate a smaller fleet for a re­duced net­work com­pared to their pre-Covid op­er­a­tions in the com­ing years.”</p>
    <p>In a memo to staff, SIA chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong said it was a “painfully dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion” to re­trench staff, the tough­est one that he has had to make in his 30 years at the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said that the group is work­ing with Singapore-based unions to fi­nalise the ar­range­ments for af­fected staff and to min­imise stress and anx­i­ety for them.</p>
    <p>“For our im­pacted col­leagues, please know that this is not a reflection of your in­di­vid­ual strengths and ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is the re­sult of an un­prece­dented travel paral­y­sis brought about by a global pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Mr Goh as­sured staff that they will get all the nec­es­sary sup­port dur­ing this try­ing time. He also urged staff to rally to­gether to get through this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said that “what we have dreaded all these months has hap­pened” with SIA’s de­ci­sion to cut jobs.</p>
    <p>He said the Gov­ern­ment will do all it can to re­store air travel in a safe man­ner.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress added that it will as­sist af­fected work­ers in any way it can.</p>
    <p>The lay­offs had been widely an­tic­i­pated as in­ter­na­tional travel con­tin­ues to be paral­ysed, with govern­ments en­forc­ing strict bor­der con­trols to con­tain the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While there has been some re­open­ing in re­cent weeks for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel be­tween Singapore and se­lected coun­tries, in­clud­ing China, the pas­sen­ger and flight num­bers are a frac­tion of pre-pan­demic days.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion has said that pas­sen­ger de­mand for air travel is not ex­pected to re­turn to pre-cri­sis lev­els un­til 2024.</p>
    <p>In July, SIA had re­ported a $1.12 bil­lion net loss in the quar­ter ended June 30 – its largest quar­terly loss on record – as de­mand plum­meted amid travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of work­ers who have been laid off by the Singapore Air­lines (SIA) Group will not find them­selves alone as they seek new em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day that the Gov­ern­ment will work with the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and in­dus­try part­ners to help place work­ers in new jobs. It will also help them tran­si­tion to other in­dus­tries or en­rol them in suit­able in­dus­try at­tach­ment and trainee­ship pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, we will con­tinue to press on, to re­store air travel in a safe man­ner, to get SIA planes back up in the sky, and re­vive our air hub,” said Mr Ong in a Face­book post fol­low­ing SIA’s an­nounce­ment that it will have to cut its to­tal work­force by 4,300 po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fac­tor­ing hir­ing freezes, early re­tire­ment and nat­u­ral at­tri­tion, about 2,400 SIA Group staff based in Singapore and over­seas will lose their jobs, with the vast ma­jor­ity be­ing for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong noted that the Gov­ern­ment has sup­ported the avi­a­tion sec­tor with mea­sures such as the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which off­sets the cost of wages for em­ploy­ers, while SIA has also raised sig­nif­i­cant cap­i­tal with the sup­port of Te­masek as well.</p>
    <p>“They have de­layed this work­force re­duc­tion as long as they can, but with air travel dec­i­mated by Covid-19, this has un­for­tu­nately be­come in­evitable,” he said.</p>
    <p>SIA chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong said in an in­ter­nal memo to staff yes­ter­day that the com­pany will con­duct the process of cut­ting jobs in a fair and re­spect­ful man­ner, and do its best to give staff the nec­es­sary sup­port.</p>
    <p>Labour chief Ng Chee Meng said the news of the job cuts did not come as a shock in the cur­rent cli­mate. But “we can’t help but still feel a deep sense of loss and sad­ness”, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng added: “I know it is tough for all con­cerned. But let us take heart, keep the faith and con­tinue to sup­port one another. Slowly but surely, we will emerge stronger to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Na­tional Trades Union Congress deputy sec­re­tarygen­eral Cham Hui Fong said the union will con­tinue to work with SIA Group on train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for its re­main­ing work­force, as well as help those whose in­comes have been im­pacted.</p>
    <p>This would help tide them over this dif­fi­cult pe­riod and be well po­si­tioned when the mar­ket re­cov­ers, she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Alan Tan, pres­i­dent of the Singapore Air­lines Staff Union, told The Straits Times that the union and SIA had tried to help the car­rier hold on to its crew, but the im­pact of the pan­demic was too se­vere.</p>
    <p>“We had ex­pected this; it is a mat­ter of when, not if,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I have been with SIA for 38 years and this is the worst cri­sis I have ex­pe­ri­enced.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said the union will help af­fected staff look for other jobs, and it will help for­eign staff in ar­eas such as get­ting them home.</p>
    <p>When asked if more job cuts might be in the pipe­line, he said it would de­pend on how the pan­demic pans out and if coun­tries lock them­selves down again.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun said re­trench­ment for air­lines was in­evitable, given that many govern­ments world­wide are still re­luc­tant to open up their bor­ders.</p>
    <p>He said the job cuts could help see SIA through the next six to nine months.</p>
    <p>“Vis­i­bil­ity for the avi­a­tion sec­tor is still some­what cloudy with air­lines un­sure of how much their ca­pac­ity can be re­stored in the com­ing months,” said Mr Song.</p>
    <p>“SIA is not alone. Air­lines every­where else have been sup­ported by gov­ern­ment mea­sures and will have to face re­al­ity when sup­port mea­sures ta­per off.”</p>
