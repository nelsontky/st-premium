    <p>Changi Air­port Group (CAG) has ap­pointed vet­eran pub­lic ser­vant Tan Gee Paw as its act­ing chair­man fol­low­ing the res­ig­na­tion of Mr Liew Mun Leong, the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF) and CAG an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who was chair­man of na­tional wa­ter agency PUB from 2001 to 2017, has been a di­rec­tor on CAG’s board since May 2017. His pre­vi­ous ap­point­ments in­clude prin­ci­pal of Ngee Ann Polytech­nic, per­ma­nent sec­re­tary for the en­vi­ron­ment and spe­cial ad­viser to the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>CAG was cor­po­ra­tised in 2009 and has re­mained di­rectly owned by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said in a state­ment that Mr Liew had in­formed CAG and MOF that given the ex­ten­sive pub­lic­ity aris­ing from the mat­ter in­volv­ing his for­mer maid Parti Liyani, he would re­sign from his po­si­tion as chair­man and as a board di­rec­tor with im­me­di­ate ef­fect, “so as not to cre­ate a dis­trac­tion to the or­gan­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew an­nounced his res­ig­na­tion from his pub­lic ser­vice and busi­ness roles yes­ter­day evening, days af­ter the High Court ac­quit­ted Ms Parti of steal­ing from Mr Liew and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment, Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn raised ques­tions about the mo­ti­va­tion of Mr Liew in lodg­ing a po­lice re­port against the maid, and the han­dling of the case. The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) is un­der­tak­ing a re­view of the case.</p>
    <p>MOF said: “The Min­istry of Fi­nance has taken note of the ob­ser­va­tions of the judge of the High</p>
    <p>Court, and the fur­ther re­view that the AGC is un­der­tak­ing.”</p>
    <p>It also ac­knowl­edged Mr Liew’s con­tri­bu­tions to the de­vel­op­ment of Changi Air­port as a pre­mier air hub, as CAG’s found­ing chair­man.</p>
    <p>“Un­der his lead­er­ship, CAG has com­pleted Ter­mi­nal 4 and Jewel, and Changi Air­port has won mul­ti­ple awards as one of the best air­ports in the world,” MOF said.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate state­ment, CAG thanked Mr Liew for his many years of ser­vice to the com­pany, as well as his con­tri­bu­tions to the de­vel­op­ment of Changi.</p>
    <p>“Un­der his lead­er­ship, CAG achieved a very strong first decade since 2009, which saw pas­sen­ger traf­fic at Changi ris­ing 84 per cent and group rev­enue more than dou­bling. Dur­ing this pe­riod, CAG also pushed the bound­aries in air­port de­vel­op­ment,” it said.</p>
    <p>CAG said Mr Liew pro­vided ste­ward­ship and strate­gic coun­sel on three land­mark projects si­mul­ta­ne­ously: Ter­mi­nal 4, Jewel Changi Air­port and Changi East.</p>
    <p>CAG chief ex­ec­u­tive Lee Seow Hiang said: “Mr Liew’s vi­sion and pas­sion for Changi was an in­spi­ra­tion to the peo­ple of CAG and the air­port com­mu­nity to al­ways strive for ex­cel­lence to de­liver an ex­cep­tional Changi ex­pe­ri­ence. The re­sult has been Changi Air­port be­ing recog­nised as the world’s most awarded air­port.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We are truly ap­pre­cia­tive of Mr Liew’s ded­i­ca­tion to grow­ing Changi Air­port over the years and to se­cur­ing Singapore’s po­si­tion as a ma­jor avi­a­tion hub.”</p>
