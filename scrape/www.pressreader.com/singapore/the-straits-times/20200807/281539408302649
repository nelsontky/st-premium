    <p>With more ac­tiv­i­ties and events re­sum­ing, bor­ders grad­u­ally re­open­ing and most for­eign work­ers set to re­sume work this month, Sin­ga­pore is cau­tiously mov­ing to­wards a new nor­mal. To sup­port these changes, trav­ellers who contract Covid-19 while on per­mit­ted es­sen­tial travel will be able to tap fi­nan­cial sup­port from to­day.</p>
    <p>With more ac­tiv­i­ties and events re­sum­ing, bor­ders grad­u­ally re­open­ing and most for­eign work­ers set to re­sume work this month, Sin­ga­pore is cau­tiously mov­ing to­wards a new nor­mal amid the pandemic.</p>
    <p>To sup­port these changes, trav­ellers who contract Covid-19 while on per­mit­ted es­sen­tial travel will be able to tap fi­nan­cial sup­port from to­day, while work­ers will be tested reg­u­larly to min­imise the chances of a flare-up.</p>
    <p>The multi-min­istry task force on the coro­n­avirus set out these steps yes­ter­day, even as it stressed the need for cau­tion and vig­i­lance to avoid a new wave of cases.</p>
    <p>Al­most all for­eign work­ers will be tested for Covid-19 by to­day, and the ma­jor­ity will be al­lowed to go back to work by the end of this month, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>This means that many con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties and projects should be able to re­sume soon, he added.</p>
    <p>And un­der changes to the charg­ing pol­icy for trav­ellers get­ting treat­ment, those who head abroad un­der per­mit­ted schemes, and de­velop symp­toms of Covid-19 in­fec­tion within 14 days of their re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, can get more help with their hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion bills.</p>
    <p>Per­mit­ted schemes in­clude bi­lat­eral ar­range­ments with Malaysia and China, and any that may be im­ple­mented in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Since March 27, Sin­ga­pore­ans, per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) and longterm pass hold­ers who trav­elled over­seas have had to pay for their own in­pa­tient med­i­cal bills in full if they de­vel­oped symp­toms within 14 days of their re­turn. They were also un­able to claim from MediShield Life or In­te­grated Shield Plans in pub­lic and pri­vate hospi­tals.</p>
    <p>But as the Gov­ern­ment grad­u­ally re­opens its bor­ders, per­mit­ted Sin­ga­porean and PR trav­ellers can now tap gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies, MediShield Life and In­te­grated Shield Plans for treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, long-term pass hold­ers who travel un­der per­mit­ted ar­range­ments can tap fi­nanc­ing ar­range­ments like for­eign worker in­sur­ance for their treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The trav­ellers will bear any re­main­ing co-pay­ment.</p>
    <p>But while cer­tain re­stric­tions are lifted or eased, life will not re­turn to what it was be­fore the world­wide spread of the coro­n­avirus, the task force warned.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force, said Sin­ga­pore should not let its guard down even though the num­ber of new Covid-19 cases here is likely to ta­per down by end-Au­gust as dor­mi­to­ries are cleared.</p>
    <p>“We have seen the ex­pe­ri­ences ev­ery­where in the world... So long as there is a lapse in the com­mu­nity or peo­ple do not ob­serve the safe man­age­ment prac­tices care­fully, these low lev­els of in­fec­tion can sud­denly flare up into large clus­ters any­where, any time,” he said.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home should re­main the de­fault for em­ploy­ees. And where pos­si­ble, events should re­main fully vir­tual, or take on a hy­brid phys­i­cal-vir­tual form.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes large gath­er­ings and fes­tiv­i­ties sur­round­ing na­tional and com­mu­nity oc­ca­sions, said task force co-chair and Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said prayers for the lu­nar sev­enth month and post-fu­neral re­li­gious rites will be al­lowed to take place in places of wor­ship and some ex­ter­nal venues like Hous­ing Board com­mon ar­eas, if con­ducted by re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions with a good track record of safe man­age­ment mea­sures, or by work­ers en­dorsed by these or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan also urged those who are un­well to see a doc­tor in­stead of try­ing to self-med­i­cate or sleep­ing it off, so that Covid-19 in­fec­tions can be de­tected at an early stage.</p>
    <p>“This will pre­vent one case from be­com­ing many cases,” he said.</p>
