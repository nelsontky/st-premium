    <p>It was a scene that dis­turbed many of us across the is­land: A man walk­ing the street to voice his dis­tress over los­ing more than $200,000 of his Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) money in a failed in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The be­spec­ta­cled mid­dle-aged man walked around the court­yard in Raf­fles Place in Fe­bru­ary last year with a home-made sand­wich board on which he wrote the gist of his plight.</p>
    <p>Ap­par­ently, he with­drew $250,000 from his CPF ac­count that was meant for his re­tire­ment and put the funds into an in­vest­ment. He did not say what he in­vested in, but things went wrong and he suf­fered a 95 per cent loss.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, he had only $11,200 left from his orig­i­nal in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The last sen­tence on his board prob­a­bly tugged on the heart strings of passers-by who saw him that day.</p>
    <p>“$238,800 gone with the wind. My lov­ing wife is very, very sad. What should I do now???”</p>
    <p>While it is not known what has hap­pened to him since, the pic­ture of him is still cir­cu­lat­ing on­line – as a grim re­minder of the se­vere con­se­quences that can be­fall those who take un­nec­es­sary risks with their hard-earned money.</p>
    <p>With even fixed de­posit rates at banks lan­guish­ing at 0.6 per cent or lower, a pop­u­lar re­frain from in­vest­ment-type folks is that you must “make your money work harder for you”.</p>
    <p>But be­fore you sign up for any in­vest­ment pack­age, ask your­self whether you are fi­nan­cially sta­ble: Could you stom­ach the type of loss that hit the man in Raf­fles Place if your in­vest­ment also goes belly up?</p>
    <p>If you can­not, in­stead of making your money work harder, you will end up work­ing harder through old age in­stead.</p>
    <p>CPF IN­VEST­MENT MIS­CON­CEP­TION</p>
    <p>Frankly, if you need to use the money in your CPF ac­count for in­vest­ment and not your spare cash, you do not have suf­fi­cient means to weather the risks.</p>
    <p>There is much chat­ter in the market from some in­vest­ment firms that are con­stantly urg­ing peo­ple to in­vest their CPF money – they claim they can do bet­ter than its 2.5 per cent re­turn.</p>
    <p>If so, then why do these com­pa­nies in­sist on tak­ing an up­front fee on the sum to be in­vested? If they are cer­tain to make money, should they not make their ser­vice free and ask for, say, 30 per cent of all prof­its earned, since it is far more lu­cra­tive than the small up­front fee.</p>
    <p>The an­swer must be that no in­vest­ment is a sure-win, and you would do well to un­der­stand this first. Is a guar­an­teed 2.5 per cent re­turn re­ally that bad?</p>
    <p>Just look at the maths – the majority of peo­ple who in­vested their CPF money were bet­ter off just leav­ing their funds in their Or­di­nary Ac­count (OA), which earns a guar­an­teed 2.5 per cent each year.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, from Oc­to­ber 2018 to Septem­ber last year, 54 per cent ac­tu­ally did worse, with 32 per cent suf­fer­ing losses. The other 22 per cent did not suf­fer any losses on their in­vest­ment, but their re­turns were less than the in­ter­est that they would have re­ceived from CPF.</p>
    <p>The re­sults are likely to be worse this year, con­sid­er­ing that many busi­nesses around the world have been hit by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In an on­line post­ing pro­mot­ing the use of CPF money for in­vest­ment, a sum of $30,000 was in­vested in Jan­uary this year as a demon­stra­tion, to show that you can ap­par­ently make more money.</p>
    <p>By the end of July, the in­vest­ment made “a gain” of about $450, but the to­tal sum plus gain was about $29,800, pre­sum­ably af­ter pay­ing off fees for the trade. The post did not men­tion that if the same sum had been left in the CPF OA, it would have grown to over $30,400.</p>
    <p>WILL YOUR CPF</p>
    <p>RUN OUT OF MONEY?</p>
    <p>Be very wary when peo­ple ask you to in­vest your CPF money now, be­cause they prob­a­bly do not have your best in­ter­ests at heart.</p>
    <p>They tar­get the CPF as many peo­ple be­low 50 can­not touch those funds for a long time, and so may be more will­ing to trans­fer them out.</p>
    <p>To do so, two bo­gey­men are of­ten used to scare peo­ple into in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>The first is to point out that the OA’s 2.5 per cent is barely enough to pro­vide for the pos­si­ble an­nual in­fla­tion rate of 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>But these folks will usu­ally not men­tion that if you leave $100,000 in your OA, you will def­i­nitely see it be­come $102,500 next year.</p>
    <p>The sum will never drop due to losses or trad­ing charges.</p>
    <p>If that same amount is in the Spe­cial Ac­count, it will be $104,000 one year later.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond bo­gey­man is worse: They will say that due to in­creased longevity, many peo­ple will find them­selves with no money left in their CPF ac­counts in old age if they do not in­vest it. They sim­ply ig­nore the ex­is­tence of the CPF Life longevity in­sur­ance scheme, which specif­i­cally aims to ad­dress this point – life­long monthly pay­ments un­til the day you die.</p>
    <p>This is why it is risky to gam­ble with your CPF money, be­cause ev­ery work­ing adult should aim to set aside as much as they can – as much as $288,000 if pos­si­ble – so that they can have a fixed in­come of up to $2,400 a month from age 65.</p>
    <p>By 85, you would have col­lected $576,000 – what kind of in­vest­ment can give you this kind of re­turn that is risk-free? Un­like other in­vest­ments, this pay­ment is guar­an­teed by the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>By all means, if you think you can make a lot of money by in­vest­ing, use the cash in your bank ac­count, which is earn­ing next to noth­ing.</p>
    <p>Leave the money in your CPF as it is work­ing rather hard al­ready.</p>
    <p>Learn from the man in Raf­fles Place – do not put your­self at risk of poverty in old age.</p>
