    <p>Cus­tomers rushed to make payment for their pur­chases at Robin­sons yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, when the iconic re­tailer an­nounced in­store that the Raf­fles City out­let, its last, would close by 3pm.</p>
    <p>The early clo­sure came as a sur­prise to many Satur­day shop­pers, as liq­uida­tor Kor­daMen­tha had ear­lier said that the store’s last day will not be later than to­day.</p>
    <p>A Kor­daMen­tha spokesman said yes­ter­day that the store was clos­ing ear­lier as all the stock had been sold. When The Sun­day Times vis­ited the store at 1pm yes­ter­day, there were about 20 people on each floor.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Koh Swee Gek, 80, was rum­mag­ing through the re­main­ing items. It was the third time that she had vis­ited the store in the past week, hav­ing been there ear­lier on Mon­day and Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh has fond mem­o­ries of Robin­sons, hav­ing of­ten walked past its Raf­fles Place build­ing on her way to work in the 1970s. She was then a den­tal staff nurse at the now-de­mol­ished Peck Seah Pri­mary School in Telok Ayer.</p>
    <p>“I would make a de­tour and walk past Robin­sons just to see what was in the win­dow dis­plays,” said Ms Koh, who was heart­bro­ken about the store’s clo­sure.</p>
    <p>The 162-year-old Robin­sons had an­nounced on Oct 30 last year the clo­sure of its last two out­lets here, say­ing the de­ci­sion to liq­ui­date was prompted by a range of fac­tors, in­clud­ing chang­ing con­sumer tastes and cost pres­sures such as rent. Its out­let at The Heeren in Or­chard Road was closed on Dec 16.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh praised the staff who served cus­tomers thought­fully through­out, right up to the clo­sure.</p>
    <p>One staff mem­ber, whom she re­mem­bered as Theresa, had rec­om­mended some lip­sticks to her based on her com­plex­ion and helped her choose the shades on Fri­day. “My hands shake some­times be­cause I’m old but she helped me open ev­ery lip­stick I</p>
    <p>wanted to try,” she said.</p>
    <p>Another cus­tomer, Mr Soo Tat Yan, 65, had vis­ited the store shortly af­ter spend­ing his stay­home no­tice at the nearby Swis­so­tel the Stam­ford. He had not in</p>
    <p>tended to make one last visit yes­ter­day but de­cided to take a look as it was rain­ing out­side.</p>
    <p>“When I was 16, I bought my first wal­let with my own money from Robin­sons at Raf­fles Place af­ter I</p>
    <p>landed my first job,” said the con­sul­tant who works in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Although it was the last day of oper­a­tion for the store, the staff were up­beat, briskly serv­ing cus­tomers un­til the last one left at 3.57pm.</p>
    <p>“I’m ac­tu­ally re­lieved that we man­aged to sell ev­ery­thing, even most of the fix­tures,” said a sales su­per­vi­sor who wanted to be known only as Ms Nu­rul.</p>
    <p>This is the 27-year-old’s first re­tail job and she has been with the com­pany for eight years.</p>
    <p>She is grate­ful to the liq­uida­tors who re­as­sured re­main­ing em­ploy­ees that they were “one of the top” pri­or­i­ties among the un­se­cured cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>“I feel lucky that we were able to sell ev­ery­thing so the com­pany can clear its debts,” she said.</p>
    <p>The staff would have Christ­mas par­ties in good years, and she said she would still try to meet her col­leagues to cel­e­brate Chi­nese New Year, Hari Raya and Deep­avali.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity guard Andy Loh, 48, said he would miss the people too.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh, who is with se­cu­rity com­pany FSI, has worked shifts at Robin­sons for six years.</p>
    <p>When he heard the store was clos­ing, he asked his com­pany for shifts to be there un­til its last day.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh said: “Even when we were very busy dur­ing events, the man­agers would buy us food. When cus­tomers com­plained, they would lis­ten to the staff in­stead of just tak­ing the cus­tomer’s side.”</p>
    <p>When asked about his favourite mem­o­ries of the store, he said: “When you stepped into Robin­sons, ev­ery minute, ev­ery sec­ond was a good ex­pe­ri­ence. I never thought it would end.”</p>
