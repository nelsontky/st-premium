    <p>BANGKOK • Thai politi­cians and protest lead­ers laid flo­ral wreaths yes­ter­day at a mon­u­ment com­mem­o­rat­ing the an­niver­sary of a stu­dent mas­sacre more than 40 years ago, as sur­vivors re­flected on the younger gen­er­a­tion’s lat­est democ­racy push.</p>
    <p>The Oct 6, 1976, killings, car­ried out by se­cu­rity forces and roy­al­ist mili­tias, stood out for their bru­tal­ity. At least 46 stu­dent pro­test­ers were shot, beaten to death or hanged from trees as they ral­lied at Bangkok’s Tham­masat Univer­sity against the re­turn of a mil­i­tary dic­ta­tor who was ousted from power just three years ear­lier.</p>
    <p>No­body has ever been held ac­count­able for the blood­shed, which crit­ics say is a re­flec­tion of an on­go­ing cul­ture of im­punity sur­round­ing the coun­try’s mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Thai­land is in the throes of a nascent pro-democ­racy move­ment, with mas­sive demon­stra­tions across the coun­try de­mand­ing an over­haul of its mil­i­taryaligne­d gov­ern­ment and re­forms to the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>“It’s like his­tory re­peat­ing it­self... They were stu­dents who came out to protest, de­mand­ing change in our so­ci­ety,” said lawyer Anon Nampa, one of the most prom­i­nent faces of the move­ment, at the me­mo­rial yes­ter­day. Op­po­si­tion MP Rangsi­man Rome pointed to sedi­tion charges tar­get­ing Mr Anon, as well as dozens of ac­tivists, as proof of the need for re­form.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the pro-es­tab­lish­ment Demo­crat Party also at­tended the event. “If ev­ery side un­der­stands the his­tory, then we can solve our coun­try’s prob­lems,” for­mer MP Tankhun Jit­tit­sara said.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent crop of ac­tivists have stud­ied Thai­land’s his­tory and are un­afraid to dis­cuss “the root cause” of the king­dom’s prob­lems, said Pheu Thai MP Sutham Saeng­pra­toom, who was a stu­dent leader dur­ing the 1976 crack­down.</p>
    <p>“My gen­er­a­tion didn’t dare to talk about the en­tire truth but these stu­dents are bold,” he told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Sur­vivor Jin Kam­ma­chon – who saw his par­ents and girl­friend killed that day – is heart­ened that to­day’s stu­dents have been us­ing a bal­lad he com­posed as a protest song.</p>
    <p>“The songs I com­posed more than 40 years ago can still be used in to­day’s strug­gles,” he told AFP.</p>
    <p>And he has writ­ten a new song with the lyrics: “If we don’t sur­ren­der, we will not be de­feated.”</p>
