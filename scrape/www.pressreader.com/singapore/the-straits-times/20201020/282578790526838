    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to think for your­self is an as­set. Fall back on your own ideas and ask ques­tions of oth­ers’ less fea­si­ble no­tions.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your deeper brain is en­gaged with re­al­ity in a new way, so take time to fig­ure stuff out. Your philo­soph­i­cal lean­ings start to shine through.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>It is much harder to con­vince oth­ers you are right. Do not preach or rant. Lay the ground­work for a more per­sua­sive case later.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You need help, but you are the best per­son for the job. Spend some time on self-care and see if oth­ers can han­dle their own is­sues for a while.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy lev­els are high, so you should be able to tackle chal­lenges that comes your way. But you may have a hard time un­wind­ing.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Push your­self to tackle the prob­lem that ev­ery­one is ig­nor­ing. It can be hard to take re­spon­si­bil­ity, but it should be re­ward­ing in the long run.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are good at ex­press­ing your­self, but you should find that you are out­do­ing your­self. Let people know how ex­cited you are.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You are not eas­ily per­suaded, but some­one by­passes your scep­ti­cism. It may take ef­fort to shake him or her off, but it is worth­while.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Some­one con­fesses his or her ad­mi­ra­tion for you and you may feel the same way. This could lead to ro­mance or some­thing else.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You can be in­tensely ide­al­is­tic – and a new sit­u­a­tion de­mands it. Do not push too hard if you meet re­sis­tance. You need al­lies, af­ter all.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your net­work can never have too many con­nec­tions. Your so­cial en­ergy is hum­ming and you should be even more at­trac­tive than usual.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Keep mum for now – it is easy to in­ad­ver­tently let cats out of bags. A friend pesters you for more de­tails; try to avoid him or her for a while.</p>
