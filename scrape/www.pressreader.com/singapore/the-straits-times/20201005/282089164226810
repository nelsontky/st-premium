    <p>It is heart­en­ing to see more teenagers and young adults seek­ing help for men­tal health is­sues dur­ing these un­prece­dented times (Youth with men­tal health prob­lems stay strong un­der Covid-19, ST On­line, Sept 5).</p>
    <p>I have been given a break from school and the iso­la­tion has been im­mensely ben­e­fi­cial to my men­tal health. Be­yond es­tab­lish­ing bound­aries, hav­ing cop­ing strate­gies and go­ing to trusted adults, schools also play an es­sen­tial role in check­ing on their stu­dents’ well-be­ing and cre­at­ing a healthy learning en­vi­ron­ment through on­line means, school coun­sel­lors, sur­veys or other means.</p>
    <p>Over­all, it was a re­lief to read that the chance for self-re­flec­tion through iso­la­tion has had an over­all pos­i­tive ef­fect on youth seek­ing help. Be­ing away from their so­cial cir­cles and con­fined to home has si­mul­ta­ne­ously in­creased the sever­ity of ex­ist­ing is­sues and in­duced new ones.</p>
    <p>I wish for fel­low teenagers to stay re­silient and push through these lonely and tir­ing days.</p>
    <p>Yew Jien Lynn, 16</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary 4 stu­dent</p>
