    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) will en­hance a scheme such that for­eign banks with a deep pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore could one day be al­lowed to open dig­i­tal-only banks as a sep­a­rate unit with less paid-up cap­i­tal in the way lo­cal lenders are able to do.</p>
    <p>It an­nounced this yes­ter­day, along with nam­ing Stan­dard Char­tered Bank the first Sig­nif­i­cantly Rooted For­eign Bank (SRFB), al­low­ing the lender to dou­ble its foot­print in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Un­der an en­hanced SRFB frame­work, MAS said, it will con­sider grant­ing an ad­di­tional full bank li­cence to an SRFB that sub­stan­tially ex­ceeds the base­line cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>“This will en­able them to have the same flex­i­bil­ity as Sin­ga­por­ein­cor­po­rated bank­ing groups to es­tab­lish sub­sidiaries, in­clud­ing with joint-ven­ture part­ners, to op­er­ate new or al­ter­na­tive busi­ness mod­els such as a dig­i­tal-only bank,” said the reg­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>In or­der to de­ter­mine if a for­eign bank sub­stan­tially ex­ceeds the cri­te­ria, MAS said it will take into ac­count fac­tors such as whether a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of global key ap­point­ment hold­ers are based in the coun­try, the cre­ation of a sub­stan­tial num­ber of jobs or count­ing a lo­cal group as a ma­jor share­holder.</p>
    <p>“The en­hanced SRFB frame­work will strengthen the abil­ity of SRFBs to com­ple­ment the lo­cal banks as an­chors to Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial sys­tem,” MAS said.</p>
    <p>Wel­com­ing the move, Mr Wee Ee Cheong, deputy chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of United Over­seas Bank, told The Straits Times the en­hance­ment of the SRFB frame­work “will help deepen the com­mit­ment of for­eign banks to Sin­ga­pore’s progress through the cre­ation of more lo­cal jobs, as well as more bank­ing prod­ucts and ser­vices for the ben­e­fit of cus­tomers over the long term. The move will also help boost the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, our econ­omy and in­vestor con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal frame­work was an­nounced in 2012, with SRFB awards to be granted to “sig­nif­i­cantly rooted” Qual­i­fy­ing Full Banks (QFBs) as part of an over­all pack­age ne­go­ti­ated un­der free trade agree­ments with th­ese for­eign banks’ home coun­tries. The first free trade pact that in­cludes SRFB com­mit­ments, the EU-Sin­ga­pore Free Trade Agree­ment, came into force in Novem­ber last year, open­ing the door for StanChart’s SRFB award.</p>
    <p>The Lon­don-based lender can now op­er­ate up to 50 places of busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore, of which 35 can be branches. This is dou­ble the 25 places of busi­ness or branches that QFBs can open. StanChart cur­rently has 18 places of busi­ness, of which 16 are bank branches, a spokesman told ST.</p>
    <p>There are nine QFBs in Sin­ga­pore, which are al­lowed to op­er­ate in more lo­ca­tions than nonQFBs. Of the nine, four – StanChart, Citibank, May­bank and HSBC – have lo­cally in­cor­po­rated their re­tail busi­nesses as re­quired by MAS.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify for SRFB priv­i­leges, MAS con­sid­ers a range of at­tributes, in­clud­ing the bank’s alignment of eco­nomic in­ter­ests with Sin­ga­pore’s, lo­cal busi­ness pres­ence, and com­mit­ment to Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity and de­vel­op­ment in the long term.</p>
    <p>StanChart Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Pa­trick Lee yes­ter­day wel­comed the SRFB award and said the bank would re­view its strat­egy and de­vel­op­ment plans, “with a view to in­vest more and fur­ther deepen (its) pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee noted that as one of the old­est banks here, with a his­tory of serv­ing clients for over 160 years, StanChart “has re­mained stead­fast in its com­mit­ment to Sin­ga­pore”. Last year, it be­came the first and only in­ter­na­tional bank to in­cor­po­rate all its busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore. It is also the largest for­eign bank­ing sub­sidiary here, with a US$80 bil­lion (S$110 bil­lion) bal­ance sheet backed by US$6 bil­lion of cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Since 2018, StanChart has in­creased its head­count in Sin­ga­pore from 8,000 to 10,000 – of which over 1,200 roles are in fu­ture growth ar­eas such as dig­i­tal bank­ing, in­ter­na­tional bank­ing, cy­ber, data so­lu­tions, an­a­lyt­ics, cloud and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>The bank, which counts Te­masek as a ma­jor share­holder, an­nounced in June that it would in­vest a fur­ther $5 mil­lion over three years to boost tal­ent de­vel­op­ment and reskilling in sup­port of on­go­ing plans to grow the busi­ness and ac­cel­er­ate dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
