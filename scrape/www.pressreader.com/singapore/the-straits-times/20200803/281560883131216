    <p>A $75 mil­lion grant has sup­ported 11 of 17 ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPOs) on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) since Jan­uary last year, and widened re­search coverage on SGX-listed firms. The Grant for Eq­uity Mar­ket Sin­ga­pore sup­ports com­pa­nies that want to list on the bourse by de­fray­ing part of their costs.</p>
    <p>A $75 mil­lion grant launched last year to raise Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as a fi­nan­cial hub has borne fruit, by help­ing com­pa­nies to list on the bourse and sup­port re­search ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>The Grant for Eq­uity Mar­ket Sin­ga­pore sup­ports com­pa­nies that want to list on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) by de­fray­ing part of their costs. It also aims to strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s re­search coverage of en­ter­prises by groom­ing eq­uity re­search tal­ent, and sup­port ini­tia­tives to pro­pel the eq­uity re­search ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) said that since the grant was launched in Jan­uary last year, SGX has seen 17 ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPOs), 11 of which were sup­ported un­der the grant.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese com­pa­nies have op­er­a­tions in the re­gion and are from a di­verse range of in­dus­tries, in­clud­ing health­care, in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy as well as food and bev­er­age.</p>
    <p>“This is a small but en­cour­ag­ing start. We con­tinue to see good in­ter­est from po­ten­tial is­suers in the grant scheme, and we hope to sup­port el­i­gi­ble en­ter­prises, in­clud­ing firms from new tech­nol­ogy and high-growth sec­tors, to list on SGX,” MAS told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>It noted that although the health­care and consumer sec­tors are among the stronger ar­eas for SGX, the cash equities mar­ket over­all has not done as well as the mar­kets for de­riv­a­tives and real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are stay­ing pri­vate longer as they have al­ter­na­tive sources to fund growth and ex­pan­sion, the MAS spokesman added, as glob­ally, IPOs fell 20 per cent to a three-year low last year.</p>
    <p>“SGX, MAS and the in­dus­try are work­ing to lever­age our broader</p>
    <p>With fund­ing sup­port from the grant, we have been able to in­crease our team’s ca­pac­ity and ben­e­fit from a cost-sav­ings per­spec­tive. We have since been able to broaden our coverage for Sin­ga­pore stocks, specif­i­cally among the of­ten over­looked mi­dand ’’ small-cap com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>MR JOEL NG, re­search head at in­vest­ment ser­vice firm KGI Se­cu­ri­ties, on the Grant for Eq­uity Mar­ket Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>strengths as a fi­nan­cial hub to im­prove the eq­uity-rais­ing land­scape in Sin­ga­pore,” she said.</p>
    <p>SGX global head of eq­uity cap­i­tal mar­kets Mo­hamed Nasser Is­mail said that while the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has had an im­pact on list­ings glob­ally, SGX has seen an in­crease in in­ter­est in re­cent weeks, as var­i­ous mar­kets and economies re­open.</p>
    <p>He said: “We ex­pect some com­pa­nies to up­hold their plans to seek ac­cess to cap­i­tal. As a pub­lic list­ing plat­form, we con­tinue to sup­port our listed com­pa­nies in their fund-rais­ing needs and pro­fil­ing ef­forts, at var­i­ous stages of their busi­ness growth.”</p>
    <p>In the first half of this year, pri­mary fund rais­ing on SGX was $720.6 mil­lion, about 50 per cent lower year on year. But sec­ondary fund rais­ing was $9.4 bil­lion, a five­fold in­crease year on year.</p>
    <p>Over the past five years, SGXlisted firms have suc­cess­fully raised about four times more funds through the sec­ondary mar­ket than at IPO.</p>
    <p>The bourse has also tried to en­gage in­vestors, listed firms and is­suers. In the first half of the year, it ar­ranged 25 ed­u­ca­tion events that fea­tured listed com­pa­nies and is­suers, reach­ing about 13,000 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>The progress for the re­search com­po­nent has also been en­cour­ag­ing, and since the launch of the grant, there has been a con­sid­er­able in­crease in re­search coverage on SGX-listed com­pa­nies, said Mr Chan Kum Kong, SGX’s se­nior vi­cepres­i­dent and head of re­search and anal­y­sis for equities.</p>
    <p>MAS said the take-up for the re­search tal­ent de­vel­op­ment scheme has been pro­gress­ing well, with about 10 re­search houses hav­ing com­mit­ted to hir­ing nearly 50 fresh grad­u­ates and ex­pe­ri­enced an­a­lysts over the next three years. “This will strengthen our do­mes­tic re­search ecosys­tem by groom­ing new eq­uity re­search tal­ent, which will sup­port the IPO and in­vest­ment ecosys­tem to im­prove in­vestor knowl­edge, and in turn fa­cil­i­tate price dis­cov­ery and liq­uid­ity,” MAS said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said the first can­di­date un­der the re­search tal­ent de­vel­op­ment grant joined in July last year, and over the past year, all can­di­dates un­der the pro­gramme have pro­duced nearly 180 re­search re­ports in to­tal.</p>
    <p>There is also ad­di­tional re­search coverage now for more than 40 SGX-listed com­pa­nies. Most of th­ese com­pa­nies had lit­tle or min­i­mal re­search coverage be­fore the grant.</p>
    <p>He said: “Over the past year, we have been col­lat­ing feed­back from the in­dus­try and will work to­gether with MAS to look at ways to make this pro­gramme even more suc­cess­ful.”</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies also said the grant has been help­ful.</p>
    <p>Mr Joel Ng, re­search head at in­vest­ment ser­vice firm KGI Se­cu­ri­ties, said: “With fund­ing sup­port from the grant, we have been able to in­crease our team’s ca­pac­ity and ben­e­fit from a cost-sav­ings per­spec­tive. We have since been able to broaden our coverage for Sin­ga­pore stocks, specif­i­cally among the of­ten over­looked mi­dand small-cap com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>He said two an­a­lysts have been added to the team, cov­er­ing an ad­di­tional 20 com­pa­nies in-depth.</p>
    <p>Mr Soh Wai Kong, vice-pres­i­dent of fi­nance at man­u­fac­turer AEM Hold­ings, said the com­pany has ben­e­fited from ad­di­tional re­search coverage by a DBS an­a­lyst as it helps to ed­u­cate the pub­lic and in­vestors about the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that added re­search and in­vestor out­reach ac­tiv­i­ties have helped raise aware­ness and un­der­stand­ing of our busi­ness model, and aid in­vestors in their in­vest­ment de­ci­sion-mak­ing process.”</p>
    <p>KGI Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Nur Ami­rah Mo­ham­mad Yu­soff, 25, said the grant opened up op­por­tu­ni­ties within eq­uity re­search for her af­ter grad­u­a­tion. It also al­lowed for greater coverage for small firms that might be over­looked, she added.</p>
    <p>DBS re­search an­a­lyst Chung Wei Le, 26, said: “I think that with the shrink­ing sell-side re­search in­dus­try, fewer firms are be­ing cov­ered pub­licly. The grant has helped in­crease this by re­quir­ing each can­di­date to cover a min­i­mum of 10 listed firms over the span of two years.”</p>
