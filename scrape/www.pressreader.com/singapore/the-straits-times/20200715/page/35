        life C3 THE STRAITS TIMES WEDNESDAY, JULY 15, 2020 | | | 30 Days Of Art With NAC To inspire and uplift readers as the country emerges from the Covid-19 circuit breaker, The Straits Times, supported by the National Arts Council as part of the #SGCultureA­nywhere campaign, has commission­ed 30 works by local writers and artists on the pandemic and what it will be like when all this is over Day 28 Getting creative at home for short film Ong Sor Fern Senior Culture Correspond­ent Actor Erwin Shah Ismail has been a computer network engineer and, in his theatre career, he has played the ukulele, danced and performed stunts.
For the 30 Days Of Art series, the 34-year-old had to wear a few more hats: “I had to play the role of scriptwrit­er, director and actor.
“The role I am least familiar with is scriptwrit­er. I took inspiratio­n from my favourite local playwright­s like Joel Tan and Alfian Sa’at to achieve a script that is banal on the surface, but filled with exposition and emotions. I’m certainly glad I have them as my points of reference.”
The resulting short film, Views, follows a protagonis­t whose human interactio­ns have been reduced to digital communicat­ion during the pandemic. He chats with his partner, who is stuck in another country, and scrolls through social media to keep in touch with friends. These are now-familiar scenarios for many after more than two months of circuit breaker-enforced isolation.
The stage veteran, who has been nominated twice for Best Supporting Actor at the Life Theatre Awards, says: “Theatre is at an intermissi­on. My peers from all department­s are affected. I wondered what they were doing to keep themselves occupied, sane and emotionall­y stable. I found some answers on social media platforms, most of them filled with positivity.
“I needed to share all that good- As Singapore cautiously exits from the circuit breaker in planned phases, he adds: “I hope viewers will accept and adapt to the new norm and find light (and their own way) at the end of the tunnel during this difficult time.” ness. I also wanted to touch on some aspects the pandemic has changed us in the way we communicat­e, think and lead our lives.”
To get around the limitation­s of shooting under phase one of the reopening of Singapore’s economy, he had to get creative with locations and collaborat­ion.
“I drew out a blueprint of my tiny apartment to figure out as many ways to shoot the film, including moving furniture around the house to accommodat­e the intention and idea of shooting it in one long take,” he says.
He roped i n his wife Tiffany Tallon to play the romantic interest so as to minimise contact with other people. But as a member of the theatre community, he wanted to include others in the work.
So, he called in a friend, Dzafirul Haniff, to work on cinematogr­aphy, and name-checked other theatre stalwarts with a clever film solution to working at a distance.
“All i n all, we enjoyed being creatively charged by the project,” he says. sorfern@sph.com.sg • Watch Views at str.sg/30Days. • For more local digital arts offerings, go to a-list.sg to appreciate #SGCultureA­nywhere Comfort cooking Wondering what to cook today? In this daily series, STFood Online Editor Hedy Khoo whips up easy eats to try at home Spicy curry prawns If you buy seafood from the wet market, it pays to get there early, not just to avoid the crowds, but also because you get your pick of the best.
That is how I came by some finelookin­g, larger-than-usual angka prawns.
That said, if you go at off-peak hours during the weekdays, when the stall holders are starting to pack up for the day around noon, you may be able to pick up good bargains too.
My favourite time to go is on rainy days, when few customers venture out and hawkers are more open to giving discounts. My method of selection is simple. If the head is firmly in place and the prawn looks appealing, I will take my chances and go for it.
Finicky customers from the prodding school of thought may disagree with my less-than-thorough method, but I have found that when you treat stallholde­rs and their offerings with respect, they are more than happy to help you pick the best from what they have.
Back to the recipe for curry prawns, to which I added Thai basil leaves. They lend their unique aromatic fragrance to the dish.
This was a tip I picked up from a colleague’s wife, who is an excellent cook.
Shallots in the spice mixture help to thicken the gravy, such that I find it unnecessar­y to use coconut milk.
You do not have to use too much oil to fry the spice mixture either. 5 READ: First issue of

Then known as The Straits Times And Singapore Journal Of Commerce, it was started by Armenian merchant Catchick Moses and English founding editor Robert Carr Woods.
The front page contained announceme­nts such as one in which a certain Captain Roberts is due to set sail for the city of Batavia, the former name of Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There were also plenty of advertisem­ents for items ranging from a “comfortabl­e and convenient­ly situated house in High Street” to an “excellent billiard table”, complete with cues.
