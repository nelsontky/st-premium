    <p>When the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit Sin­ga­pore, the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) Col­lege West could not carry out its usual fit­ness pro­grammes, which included tu­gof-war events be­tween classes and run­ning races.</p>
    <p>So to en­cour­age its stu­dents and staff to lead healthy life­styles, the school’s phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion depart­ment came up with vir­tual work­out ses­sions and ex­er­cise chal­lenges on so­cial me­dia plat­form TikTok.</p>
    <p>Want­ing to ride on that mo­men­tum, the depart­ment then de­cided to get its stu­dents and staff in­volved in The Straits Times Vir­tual Run’s 17.5km cat­e­gory. The school will see 300 stu­dents and 87 staff at­tempt­ing the race from Oct 9 to 18.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion lec­turer Mark Daniel Govin, 34, said: “What we did were live work­out videos, but that was more strength train­ing, not so much car­dio. Be­cause of the pan­demic, we couldn’t gather ev­ery­one, but for this vir­tual run, it is great be­cause we can do it in our own time.</p>
    <p>“It’s safe but they also get to clock their dis­tance. It’s nice that we’re do­ing it to­gether so they are al­ready ex­cited for it, they’re com­par­ing (their runs) with each other.”</p>
    <p>ITE is also plan­ning its own vir­tual run in Novem­ber and Govin thought that the STVR was the per­fect plat­form for them to ex­pe­ri­ence what a vir­tual run was like.</p>
    <p>On why she wanted to take part in the vir­tual race, first-year stu­dent Ng Li Yan said: “We don’t have to com­plete it within a day and we can run at own time and pace so you won’t feel pres­sured by other run­ners’ pres­ence.”</p>
    <p>The 17-year-old has been run­ning twice a week over dis­tances of about 2km to train for event.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers like Mikhail Raiyan Ab­dul Aziz have also been train­ing for the run. The Year 2 stu­dent ac­tively par­tic­i­pated in the vir­tual ac­tiv­i­ties or­gan­ised by the school and be­gan run­ning a lot more dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, clock­ing 100km in less than a month.</p>
    <p>To prepare for the up­com­ing STVR, he has been run­ning at least three times a week. The 18-year-old said: “It’s been hard to take part in ac­tiv­i­ties out­side and in ITE (dur­ing the pan­demic) so when the STVR event popped up, I wanted to take part in it.”</p>
