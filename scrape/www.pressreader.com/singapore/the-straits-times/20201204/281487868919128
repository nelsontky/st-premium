    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated many large-scale so­ci­etal, eco­nomic and tech­no­log­i­cal trends, and this will have last­ing ef­fects on how peo­ple live, work and in­ter­act with one an­other, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong.</p>
    <p>To bet­ter pre­pare stu­dents for this fast-chang­ing en­vi­ron­ment, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) will adopt four main strate­gies, he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It will step up ef­forts to max­imise op­por­tu­ni­ties for dis­ad­van­taged stu­dents, build mul­ti­ple path­ways for stu­dents to hone their strengths, help them de­velop at­ti­tudes and skills beyond book knowl­edge, and fo­cus more on in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said there are ma­jor trends that are al­ready un­der way which will con­tinue to ac­cel­er­ate, such as on­line shop­ping, dig­i­tal en­ter­tain­ment and vir­tual com­mu­ni­ca­tions. Th­ese trends will surely con­tinue af­ter Covid-19, he added.</p>
    <p>“There will be un­equal re­cov­ery across in­dus­tries and coun­tries, post-pan­demic, and there will surely be last­ing ef­fects on how we live, work and in­ter­act with each other for the fore­see­able fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing on the fu­ture of ed­u­ca­tion at the first ses­sion of a we­bi­nar series by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS). The NUS115 Dis­tin­guished Speaker Series, with the theme “Shap­ing the fu­ture”, cel­e­brates the univer­sity’s 115th an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said MOE’s first strat­egy is to dou­ble down on on­go­ing ef­forts to max­imise op­por­tu­ni­ties for dis­ad­van­taged stu­dents. The Gov­ern­ment will in­crease in­vest­ments in re­search and de­vel­op­ment to guide such ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“We want to in­vest more to even out the dif­fer­ences early in life, and give chil­dren full ac­cess to ap­pro­pri­ate health, learn­ing and de­vel­op­men­tal sup­port,” he said.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond strat­egy is to en­sure that in­sti­tu­tions have, and con­tinue to build on, mul­ti­ple path­ways for stu­dents to hone their strengths.</p>
    <p>“We have long recog­nised that ev­ery child is unique, and we need dif­fer­ent ap­proaches to help them learn and grow,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>He noted that over the years, there has been a wide range of op­tions for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, schools such as the NUS High School of Math and Sci­ence cater to those with spe­cialised in­ter­ests. For those who thrive in a more prac­ti­cal, hand­son learn­ing en­vi­ron­ment, there are schools like Crest and Spec­tra Sec­ondary.</p>
    <p>This mul­ti­ple path­way ap­proach must also ex­tend beyond schools to ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>He noted that there is now a range of var­ied and high-qual­ity in­sti­tu­tions here, with the six au­ton­o­mous uni­ver­si­ties as well as spe­cialised in­sti­tu­tions such as the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.</p>
    <p>Strong skill and vo­ca­tional path­ways are also an­chored by the poly­tech­nics and In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“This di­ver­sity is a ma­jor strength, which we must con­tinue to up­hold,” he said.</p>
    <p>Third, stu­dents will need to de­velop at­ti­tudes and skills beyond book knowl­edge, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>“The way for­ward for us is to con­tinue to em­pha­sise our com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage and our hu­man strengths,” he said, cit­ing skills such as the abil­ity to build re­la­tion­ships with one an­other and to col­lab­o­rate and work in teams.</p>
    <p>Pupils will learn to do this from pri­mary school, he said, not­ing that the min­istry has freed up time for them by re­mov­ing as­sess­ments and ex­am­i­na­tions in cer­tain years.</p>
    <p>With that time, ed­u­ca­tors will fo­cus on de­vel­op­ing 21st-cen­tury com­pe­ten­cies, in­clud­ing core val­ues like re­spect and re­silience, and skill sets like crit­i­cal think­ing.</p>
    <p>The fourth strat­egy is to push for more in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary learn­ing to sup­port ca­reer mo­bil­ity and “pre­pare Sin­ga­pore­ans for a more dy­namic and un­cer­tain fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>But he cau­tioned that it is im­por­tant to get the bal­ance right.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to swing from one ex­treme to the other. Sub­ject spe­cial­i­sa­tion is still nec­es­sary and will still be im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“But at the same time, we must think of in­di­vid­ual dis­ci­plines as the dif­fer­ent branches on the tree of knowl­edge. The branches are con­stantly grow­ing and pro­duc­ing new twigs. But re­mem­ber, we are ul­ti­mately part of the same tree.</p>
    <p>“We must nurture the abil­ity to see the broader con­nec­tion of things and to work seam­lessly across dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines. Be­cause of­ten, it is in the bor­ders or the gaps be­tween dis­ci­plines where we find op­por­tu­ni­ties for new dis­cov­er­ies and we can ad­vance the fron­tiers of knowl­edge.”</p>
    <p>To bet­ter pre­pare stu­dents for a fast-chang­ing, in­creas­ingly com­plex world, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong an­nounced yes­ter­day that his min­istry will press on with four ini­tia­tives it has em­barked on in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on the fu­ture of ed­u­ca­tion at the in­au­gu­ral we­bi­nar in a Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore series, he said the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) will step up ef­forts to max­imise op­por­tu­ni­ties for dis­ad­van­taged stu­dents, build mul­ti­ple path­ways for stu­dents, help them de­velop at­ti­tudes and skills beyond book knowl­edge, and fo­cus more on in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary learn­ing.</p>
    <p>As Mr Wong ac­knowl­edged, th­ese are not new ini­tia­tives in ed­u­ca­tion. They had been set in mo­tion a few years ago be­cause of fast-mov­ing trends around the world.</p>
    <p>But he pointed out that the Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated some of th­ese trends and made it even more ur­gent to pre­pare for the changes.</p>
    <p>No doubt, the most ur­gent of the four ini­tia­tives is the need to ad­dress in­equal­ity and en­sure that ed­u­ca­tion con­tin­ues to en­able chil­dren and youth from dis­ad­van­taged homes to level up to their peers and move ahead.</p>
    <p>In­equal­ity, es­pe­cially in child­hood, was brought into re­newed fo­cus dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when schools shut down and moved to home-based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Schools made plans well in ad­vance to en­sure that chil­dren who lacked lap­tops and In­ter­net con­nec­tions did not fall be­hind in</p>
    <p>their learn­ing. But soon, the “learn­ing” part of the equa­tion turned out to be the least of their prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Some of the chil­dren, in­stead, faced is­sues like their par­ents los­ing jobs. With the loss of in­come, some even re­ported in­stances of go­ing hun­gry, and in­ci­dents of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence. Those with par­ents in front-line jobs ex­pressed worry and anx­i­ety over the risks from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Schools stepped in to help stu­dents – from giv­ing meals and gro­ceries to pro­vid­ing coun­selling and seek­ing com­mu­nity help for their stu­dents’ par­ents.</p>
    <p>No doubt in re­cent years, the min­istry and schools have fur­ther stepped up their ef­forts to help chil­dren who are lag­ging be­hind their peers. MOE must be ap­plauded for staffing schools with wel­fare of­fi­cers and coun­sel­lors, and start­ing schemes to pro­vide meals and af­ter-school care.</p>
    <p>But as the pan­demic has shown – chil­dren’s well-be­ing and suc­cess de­pend on more than just what hap­pens in school. To help lift chil­dren from dis­ad­van­taged homes, we need to look holis­ti­cally at the en­tirety of the chil­dren’s lives.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the Gov­ern­ment will be in­creas­ing its in­vest­ments in re­search and de­vel­op­ment in this area to guide th­ese ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“We want to in­vest more to even out the dif­fer­ences early in life, and give chil­dren full ac­cess to the ap­pro­pri­ate health, learn­ing and de­vel­op­men­tal sup­port,” he said.</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly, the help must be long-term, post-pan­demic, if it is to lift the lives of th­ese chil­dren.</p>
    <p>He also an­nounced that Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion Ma­liki Os­man will be lead­ing a re­view to see what more his min­istry can do to en­sure that grad­u­ates from the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) and the five poly­tech­nics are pre­pared for the work­ing world.</p>
    <p>As he stressed, it will be im­por­tant to en­sure that the grad­u­ates “ac­quire deep skills and com­pe­ten­cies that are well matched to their in­ter­ests, and also the needs of em­ploy­ers and the in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>A sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of stu­dents in th­ese in­sti­tu­tions, es­pe­cially ITE, come from poorer homes.</p>
    <p>In a re­ces­sion, the job prospects of ITE grad­u­ates are likely to take a hit.</p>
    <p>Hence, the re­view and the schemes that fol­low must also look at how to help ITE and polytech­nic stu­dents fare bet­ter in a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The in­equities in chil­dren’s lives are not new; ed­u­ca­tors and so­cial or­gan­i­sa­tions that fo­cus their ef­forts on chil­dren know that th­ese prob­lems have ex­isted for­ever.</p>
    <p>What has hap­pened now is that the pan­demic has laid bare th­ese hard re­al­i­ties to the pub­lic. The hope is that this aware­ness of in­equities will cre­ate a new sense of ur­gency to ad­dress them.</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly, the help must be long term, post-pan­demic, if it is to lift the lives of th­ese chil­dren.</p>
