    <p>SACRA­MENTO • Nearly two dozen mas­sive wild­fires con­tin­ued to rav­age parts of Cal­i­for­nia, fu­elled by high tem­per­a­tures and on­go­ing light­ning strikes, the Cal­i­for­nia De­part­ment of Forestry and Fire Pro­tec­tion (CalFire) said.</p>
    <p>While con­di­tions eased on Satur­day, fire of­fi­cials are wor­ried that an­other ex­treme pe­riod of light­ning strikes – like the 12,000 strikes blamed for ig­nit­ing many of the 585 new fires since the pre­vi­ous week­end – could roll through North­ern Cal­i­for­nia in the com­ing days, po­ten­tially bring­ing new blazes to the scorched re­gion.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, the Na­tional Weather Ser­vice is­sued a red flag warn­ing for much of the north­ern half of the state from 5am yes­ter­day to 11pm to­day lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>The fires have killed six peo­ple and in­cin­er­ated nearly 700 build­ings. To­gether, the blazes have burned nearly 400,000ha, the agency said.</p>
    <p>Wild­fires are threat­en­ing parts of the San Fran­cisco Bay Area, the forested re­gion near the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia at Santa Cruz and a wide swathe of the area be­tween San Fran­cisco and state cap­i­tal Sacra­mento.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump de­clared the fires to be a ma­jor dis­as­ter, the White House said.</p>
    <p>The dec­la­ra­tion, which al­lows fed­eral funds to be used to help peo­ple and busi­nesses harmed by the fires in seven coun­ties to pay for tem­po­rary hous­ing, home re­pairs and other needs, came de­spite a threat from Mr Trump ear­lier last week to with­hold aid from Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Nearly 14,000 fire­fight­ers have been de­ployed to bat­tle the blazes, but con­tain­ment of the largest ones re­mains low and Cal­i­for­nia has re­quested ad­di­tional sup­port from other states and lo­cal ju­ris­dic­tions, CalFire said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Gover­nor Gavin New­som has re­quested more fire­fight­ers from as far away as the United States’ East Coast and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“They’re scram­bling for bod­ies to help fight the fires,” said Mr Jay Tracy, a fire mar­shal with the city of Fresno who was de­ployed as a spokesman for the LNU Light­ning Com­plex Fire, which had burned 127,070ha in five coun­ties, in­clud­ing some of the state’s sto­ried wine coun­try and com­mu­ni­ties be­tween San Fran­cisco and Sacra­mento.</p>
    <p>Fire­fight­ers have im­proved con­tain­ment of the south­ern edge of that fire, but winds are ex­pected to push it north-west to­wards the wine coun­try towns of Healds­burg and Guernevill­e, he said.</p>
    <p>In the past sev­eral years, in­fer­nos have scorched the Yosemite</p>
    <p>Na­tional Park, black­ened the Joshua Tree Na­tional Park’s palm­strewn Oa­sis of Mara and dam­aged other fa­mous spots.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate change is one of a num­ber of fac­tors mak­ing Cal­i­for­nia’s wild­fires so cat­a­strophic.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia has al­ways had wild­fires, since its low-rain sum­mers tend to dry out veg­e­ta­tion, which serves as fuel when sparks strike.</p>
    <p>And while the role of cli­mate change in any par­tic­u­lar fire takes time and sci­en­tific i nquiry to es­tab­lish, the link be­tween cli­mate change and big­ger fires is in­ex­tri­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>“Be­hind the scenes of all of this, you’ve got tem­per­a­tures that are about 2 to 3 deg F warmer now than they would’ve been with­out global warm­ing,” said Dr Park Wil­liams, a bio­cli­ma­tol­o­gist at Columbia Univer­sity’s La­mont-Do­herty Earth Ob­ser­va­tory.</p>
    <p>That dries out veg­e­ta­tion even more, mak­ing it more likely to burn.</p>
