    <p>It ap­pears that the cur­rent think­ing is that the Gov­ern­ment’s Pro­gres­sive Wage Model (PWM), or min­i­mum wage-plus, and any pro­posal of a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage to raise the earn­ings of lower-income work­ers are mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive (Pri­tam calls for uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage start­ing at $1,300 for S’pore­ans, Oct 13).</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that it may not be so as the two mod­els could be in­te­grated by in­cor­po­rat­ing a “liv­ing wage” com­po­nent to the PWM to be­come a hy­brid model. This could be called PWM-plus.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing that the re­quired min­i­mum or liv­ing wage is in­deed $1,300, the pro­posed work­group com­pris­ing gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, union­ists and em­ploy­ers could con­duct job eval­u­a­tion ex­er­cises to es­tab­lish an ob­jec­tive and fair mar­ket value of the jobs in sec­tors that cur­rently pay their work­ers less than $1,300.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the job eval­u­a­tion ex­er­cises, com­pare the fair mar­ket value of the jobs eval­u­ated against the said $1,300.</p>
    <p>If the fair mar­ket value of the jobs eval­u­ated is higher than $1,300, em­ploy­ers must pay their work­ers eq­ui­tably at the higher mar­ket rates.</p>
    <p>But if the fair mar­ket value is in­deed lower than $1,300, the Gov­ern­ment could top up the dif­fer­ence by tweak­ing the ex­ist­ing Work­fare Income Sup­ple­ment scheme.</p>
    <p>Ca­reer paths for job ad­vance­ments and wage in­creases, like those in the cur­rent PWM, could still be cre­ated for sec­tors deemed suit­able.</p>
    <p>This in­te­grated PWM-plus model would en­sure that work­ers in “high-value” jobs are paid eq­ui­tably at fair mar­ket rates above $1,300, while those in “low-value” jobs would still get at least $1,300 through gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies. And this would in­clude scope for fu­ture job ad­vance­ments and wage in­creases.</p>
    <p>Such a hy­brid model should not erode our com­pet­i­tive­ness sig­nif­i­cantly as em­ploy­ers would merely be re­quired to pay their work­ers eq­ui­tably at fair mar­ket rates in­de­pen­dent of whether these rates are above or be­low $1,300.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, PWM-plus could help to mit­i­gate our class di­vide and so­cial in­equal­ity, and the gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies needed would be money well spent.</p>
