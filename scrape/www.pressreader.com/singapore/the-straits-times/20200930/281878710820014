    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The dis­clo­sure that US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump paid lit­tle or no fed­eral in­come taxes for years, in­clud­ing while in of­fice, has con­vulsed the elec­tion cam­paign with only five weeks to go.</p>
    <p>The re­port i n The New York Times has scram­bled the equa­tion and stakes of the first pres­i­den­tial de­bate in the cam­paign, to be held on Tues­day night (9am to­day, Sin­ga­pore) in Cleve­land, Ohio.</p>
    <p>While Mr Trump tried to de­flect the news about his taxes and his Repub­li­can al­lies gen­er­ally kept their si­lence, Democrats pounced and for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, the party’s pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, posted a video not­ing that the Pres­i­dent paid less in in­come taxes than ev­ery­day Amer­i­cans like teach­ers, fire­fight­ers and nurses.</p>
    <p>The re­port re­vealed Mr Trump paid no fed­eral in­come taxes for 11 of the 18 years ex­am­ined and just US$750 (S$1,030) in 2016, the year he won the pres­i­dency, and US$750 in 2017, his first year in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump wrote off more than US$70,000 paid to style his hair dur­ing The Ap­pren­tice and col­lected US$72.9 mil­lion in re­funds chal­lenged by In­ter­nal Rev­enue Ser­vice au­di­tors. He owes hundreds of mil­lions of dol­lars to cred­i­tors due in the next four years.</p>
    <p>The tax data an­a­lysed by the Times fur­ther un­der­cuts the im­age of a wildly suc­cess­ful busi­ness­man long pro­jected by Mr Trump while he was re­port­ing ex­pan­sive and chronic losses by many of his mar­quee prop­er­ties – losses that he then used to re­duce or elim­i­nate his tax li­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>How the rev­e­la­tions may change the pres­i­den­tial cam­paign was an open ques­tion.</p>
    <p>The race has re­mained re­mark­ably steady and with­out ma­jor shifts through all sorts of seis­mic de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>But with only 35 days be­fore the elec­tion on Nov 3, ev­ery day that the Pres­i­dent does not trans­form the dy­nam­ics of a cam­paign – that polls show he is cur­rently trail­ing in – is a missed op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“We know the vast ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans long ago made up their minds about Pres­i­dent Trump, ei­ther for or against him, so the tax rev­e­la­tions are not likely to shift the elec­tion in any fun­da­men­tal way,” said Repub­li­can poll­ster Whit Ayres.</p>
    <p>“That said, they could play a role in giv­ing Joe Bi­den some am­mu­ni­tion for the de­bate and at the mar­gins for some peo­ple who feel that US$750 is not enough to pay in taxes re­gard­less of the cir­cum­stances.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump who, un­like other pres­i­dents since Water­gate has adamantly re­fused to re­lease his tax re­turns and fought ef­forts to ob­tain them all the way to the Supreme Court, took to Twit­ter on Mon­day to at­tack the Times re­port but with­out ac­tu­ally deny­ing any of its par­tic­u­lars.</p>
    <p>“The Fake News Me­dia, just like Elec­tion time 2016, is bring­ing up my Taxes & all sorts of other non­sense with il­le­gally ob­tained in­for­ma­tion & only bad in­tent,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“I paid many mil­lions of dol­lars in taxes but was en­ti­tled, like every­one else, to de­pre­ci­a­tion & tax cred­its.”</p>
    <p>He later re­fused to take ques­tions at his only public event of the day.</p>
    <p>But there was quiet con­cern within the cam­paign, where aides took note of daily track­ing numbers from Ras­mussen Re­ports, a typ­i­cally rosy as­sess­ment of how the Pres­i­dent is far­ing, that showed sup­port fall­ing after the tax story.</p>
    <p>Among Mr Trump’s cir­cle, there was fin­ger-point­ing about how the is­sue was han­dled and a hes­i­tancy to dis­cuss with him an is­sue they know he is sen­si­tive about.</p>
    <p>Many of the Pres­i­dent’s ad­vis­ers ar­gued that such sto­ries have never harmed his stand­ing with core sup­port­ers in the past and that this would be no ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>They recog­nised, how­ever, that Mr Trump would have to have an ef­fec­tive re­sponse pre­pared for the de­bate, the first en­counter be­tween the two can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Some aides sug­gested that he try to fi­nesse an an­swer sim­i­lar to what he has said pre­vi­ously, that tak­ing ad­van­tage of the tax code is sim­ply “smart” for a busi­ness per­son, while also paint­ing him­self as a cre­ator of jobs.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez of New York tweeted that she paid thou­sands of dol­lars in fed­eral taxes in 2016 and 2017 – when she was still work­ing as a bar­tender in New York City.</p>
    <p>“He con­trib­uted less to fund­ing our com­mu­ni­ties than wait­resses & un­doc­u­mented im­mi­grants,” the Demo­crat wrote.</p>
