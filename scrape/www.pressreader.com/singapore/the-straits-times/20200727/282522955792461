    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Regis Philbin, a ver­sa­tile Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion per­son­al­ity who hosted pop­u­lar game shows and morn­ing talk pro­grammes dur­ing a ca­reer that started in the 1950s, has died. He was 88.</p>
    <p>Philbin died last Fri­day of nat­u­ral causes, a month shy of his 89th birth­day, the As­so­ci­ated Press re­ported, cit­ing a state­ment from his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>He was the most ubiq­ui­tous TV per­son­al­ity in Amer­i­can his­tory, with al­most 17,000 hours in front of the cam­eras, Guin­ness World Records an­nounced in 2011.</p>
    <p>Much of it was un­scripted, as host of morn­ing talk shows Live With Regis And Kathie Lee and, be­gin­ning in 2001, a sim­i­lar for­mat with Kelly Ripa.</p>
    <p>His on-screen per­sona ranged from be­mused to per­son­able to can­tan­ker­ous, while his morn­ing shows ran seg­ments hark­ing back to pro­grammes from TV’s early days: beauty se­crets, celebrity in­ter­views and cook­ing demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump paid trib­ute to Philbin as “one of the greats in the his­tory of tele­vi­sion” as well as “a fan­tas­tic per­son”.</p>
    <p>Philbin’s con­tri­bu­tions to prime time were oddly tra­di­tional too: Amer­ica’s Got Tal­ent, which he em­ceed in 2006, its first sea­son, was an amped-up ver­sion of a classic for­mat.</p>
    <p>Who Wants To Be A Mil­lion­aire? re­sem­bled prime-time game shows of the 1950s, such as The US$64,000 Ques­tion.</p>
    <p>One big dif­fer­ence for the new millennium in both shows was an in­flated jack­pot: US$1 mil­lion (S$1.4 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The other was Philbin, whose snarky edge added a post-mod­ern gloss. His thun­der­ing ul­ti­ma­tum on Mil­lion­aire, “Is that your final an­swer?”, be­came a cul­tural catch­phrase.</p>
    <p>Philbin him­self dated from TV’s golden age, hav­ing moved to Los An­ge­les in the late 1950s to try his luck in show busi­ness af­ter a hitch in the US Navy. He worked as a page, TV news writer, lo­cal an­chor and talk-show host.</p>
    <p>In 1967, he be­came the an­nouncer and side­kick for The Joey Bishop Show, ABC’s an­swer to</p>
    <p>Johnny Car­son’s The Tonight Show on NBC.</p>
    <p>The Bishop show ended af­ter three years and Philbin did not re­turn to the Amer­i­can au­di­ence un­til 1988, with the syn­di­ca­tion of Live With Regis And Kathie Lee.</p>
    <p>The show paired Philbin with Kathie Lee Gif­ford as an ador­ing and tart-tongued co-host. It was less lurid than tabloid-style com­peti­tors such as Phil Don­ahue and Ger­aldo Rivera.</p>
    <p>Who Wants To Be A Mil­lion­aire? was Philbin’s big­gest hit. From a sum­mer re­place­ment on ABC in 1999, it ex­panded to four prime­time hours a week and was the toprated show on tele­vi­sion in 2000.</p>
    <p>It “sin­gle-hand­edly re­vived the net­work”, ac­cord­ing to an ar­ti­cle in The New York Times.</p>
    <p>By 2001, Mil­lion­aire fever sub­sided and the show was can­celled the fol­low­ing year. It con­tin­ued in syn­di­ca­tion with other hosts, though, and Philbin pre­sented oc­ca­sional spe­cials. Prof­its from the ini­tial run ex­ceeded US$1 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to a 2002 ar­ti­cle in The New York Times.</p>
    <p>Much later in his ca­reer, Philbin recorded al­bums, mostly stan­dards de­liv­ered in the style of his idols, Bing Crosby and Dean Martin.</p>
    <p>His record-set­ting TV host ap­pear­ances did not pre­vent Philbin from pur­su­ing a par­al­lel ca­reer as a dra­matic and voice ac­tor in dozens of movies and tele­vi­sion shows, of­ten ap­pear­ing as him­self.</p>
    <p>He also held the record for most ap­pear­ances – 136 in to­tal – as a guest on David Let­ter­man’s Late Show, ac­cord­ing to CBS.</p>
    <p>Philbin and his first wife Kay Faylen had two chil­dren, Amy and Danny, be­fore their mar­riage ended in di­vorce.</p>
    <p>With his sec­ond wife, TV per­son­al­ity Joy Se­nese, he had two daugh­ters, Joanna and Jennifer, a TV pro­ducer and screen­writer.</p>
