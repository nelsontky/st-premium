    <p>The worst of times has brought out the best in peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­u­larly so on the re­search front, where sci­en­tists in Sin­ga­pore have made their mark on the world stage.</p>
    <p>Biotech firm MiRXES, for one, switched gears as early as Jan­uary, work­ing with the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search and Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal to shift its ex­per­tise in can­cer de­tec­tion in an­other di­rec­tion – to cre­ate kits that could sniff out the virus in­stead.</p>
    <p>With six years of ex­pe­ri­ence un­der its belt pro­duc­ing PCR (poly­merase chain re­ac­tion) tests, the com­pany was able to come up with its For­ti­tude Covid-19 test kits within three weeks.</p>
    <p>Fast and highly ac­cu­rate, the PCR tests are con­sid­ered to be top of the line.</p>
    <p>With the sup­port of En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment Grant, the com­pany quickly scaled up pro­duc­tion of kits to one mil­lion per week through au­to­ma­tion, and these have since been de­ployed in 45 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, hun­dreds of doc­tors, sci­en­tists and re­searchers from all fields have thrown their weight be­hind the bat­tle against the virus – with ef­forts rang­ing from 3D print­ing of test swabs to cre­at­ing the award-win­ning con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme TraceTo­gether, as</p>
    <p>well as com­ing up with treat­ments and a pos­si­ble vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Sin­ga­pore was only the third coun­try out­side of China to suc­cess­fully cul­ture the coro­n­avirus, and lo­cal re­searchers have con­trib­uted more than 1,100 pa­pers on Covid-19 and Sars-CoV-2, which causes the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>When it comes to Covid-19 re­search, Sin­ga­pore is punch­ing above its weight, and oth­ers are tak­ing no­tice.</p>
    <p>All this is a far cry from even a decade ago, when re­searchers here lamented that the pres­sure to de­liver eco­nomic re­turns took prece­dence over more in­tan­gi­ble long-term gains in say, health­care or ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>There was also a wide­spread be­lief, even from within, that lo­cal sci­ence was not up to scratch, and crit­i­cism that groups worked in si­los, with lit­tle col­lab­o­ra­tion among teams and dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>Con­certed ef­forts through­out this pan­demic have put many of these wor­ries to rest, un­der­scor­ing the im­pact of lo­cal re­search, and the com­mu­nity’s cru­cial abil­ity to work to­gether and change tack dur­ing an emer­gency, some­thing that has been pos­si­ble only be­cause of many prior years of re­search and ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have also been able to see, at first hand, the value of sci­ence in sav­ing not just lives but also liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>The bil­lions of dol­lars pumped into re­search and in­no­va­tion have been a worth­while long-term in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the Govern­ment en­dorsed the ef­forts of re­searchers at the fore­front of the pan­demic fight, and again pledged its sup­port for re­search and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>It an­nounced a $25 bil­lion plan to chart Sin­ga­pore’s re­search land­scape over the next five years, in­clud­ing a crit­i­cal in­vest­ment to shore up its de­fences against fu­ture in­fec­tious dis­ease threats.</p>
    <p>In many ways, 2020 has marked the com­ing of age of Sin­ga­pore sci­ence, a mile­stone more than two decades in the mak­ing.</p>
    <p>It is sci­ence which will help the Repub­lic emerge from the grip of Covid-19, and to sur­vive and even thrive, in an in­creas­ingly un­cer­tain world.</p>
