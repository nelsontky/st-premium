    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s biggest po­lit­i­cal party Umno ap­pears to be in dis­ar­ray as it tries to po­si­tion it­self ahead of the Sabah state elec­tion, as sev­eral lo­cal chiefs en­gage in a power strug­gle over who should be lead­ing its cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Umno be­came the op­po­si­tion party in Sabah after los­ing the state in the May 2018 Gen­eral Elec­tion, but it is hop­ing to sup­plant Parti Warisan Sabah in the Sept 26 polls by win­ning most of the 73 state as­sem­bly seats.</p>
    <p>Warisan is led by former Sabah chief min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal, 63.</p>
    <p>It is also al­lied to fed­eral op­po­si­tion coali­tion Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) and to the group of MPs led by former prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>Warisan and its coali­tion al­lies were in firm con­trol of Malaysia’s east­ern­most state from 2018, un­til at least 13 of its as­sem­bly­men jumped ship to sup­port Tan Sri Musa Aman, a former Sabah chief min­is­ter from Umno.</p>
    <p>The top­pling of Warisan was thwarted after Datuk Seri Shafie man­aged to per­suade the state gov­er­nor to dis­solve the as­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>The state polls will be held on Sept 26, with nom­i­na­tions on Sept 12.</p>
    <p>Mr Musa, 69, an arch-en­emy of Mr Shafie, is lead­ing one fac­tion of Umno against Warisan and PH in the loom­ing elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Musa felt be­trayed that the as­sem­bly was dis­solved in­stead of al­low­ing him to take over.</p>
    <p>“We still have three years to go till the end of the term of the as­sem­bly. It is not nec­es­sary for an elec­tion now,” Mr Musa had said on July 30.</p>
    <p>He was chief min­is­ter for 15 years from 2003 un­til May 2018, when Mr Shafie took over.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral lead­er­ship of Umno, which claims mem­ber­ship of more than three mil­lion, has ap­pointed a sec­ond Sabah chieftain to lead the party in the Septem­ber polls. He is cur­rent Umno Sabah chief Bung Mok­tar Radin.</p>
    <p>But the ap­point­ment of Bung</p>
    <p>Mok­tar is op­posed by 12 Sabah Umno di­vi­sions – out of the to­tal 25 di­vi­sions – which said they were not con­sulted on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The 12 are led by the third Sabah chieftain, former Cab­i­net min­is­ter Ab­dul Rahman Dahlan, 54.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ab­dul Rahman said Bung Mok­tar would dam­age Umno’s brand should he lead the cam­paign as he is fac­ing cor­rup­tion charges.</p>
    <p>“Sabah has many high-cal­i­bre lead­ers and to ap­point some­one with per­sonal prob­lems is a huge in­sult to us and vot­ers in Sabah,” Mr Ab­dul Rahman told the me­dia last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, him­self fac­ing cor­rup­tion charges, de­fended the de­ci­sion for Bung Mok­tar to lead the cam­paign, cit­ing his po­si­tion as head of Umno in Sabah.</p>
    <p>There is a fourth lo­cal chief who could spoil Umno’s plan to re­cap­ture the state as­sem­bly – the younger brother of Mr Musa.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ani­fah Aman, 66, has left Umno and now heads Parti Cinta Sabah (Love Sabah Party), which hopes to be the third force.</p>
    <p>He had this to say of his older brother on Aug 10: “As a Saba­han, I ap­pre­ci­ate what Musa has done, but I think the time has passed and he should let new peo­ple take over.</p>
    <p>“It’s time to move on. What he had done pre­vi­ously might be right for that par­tic­u­lar time, but the taste has changed.”</p>
    <p>Adding to the con­fu­sion of po­lit­i­cal par­ties and strong per­son­al­i­ties, Umno will head into the elec­tion as part of the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) al­liance that rules the coun­try.</p>
    <p>PN is headed by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, pres­i­dent of Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia. Ber­satu has its own ideas on who should be the next Sabah chief min­is­ter should PN win – the fifth lo­cal leader Ha­jiji Mohd Noor, 66.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ha­jiji left Umno for Ber­satu when the new party formed a Sabah branch after the 2018 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Warisan coali­tion led by Mr Shafie con­trolled 45 of the 65 state seats be­fore 13 of them switched to Mr Musa’s side, lead­ing to the as­sem­bly’s dis­so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>In the Sept 26 polls, an ex­panded 73 wards will be up for grabs.</p>
