    <p>A 48-year-old Sin­ga­porean man has been de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act (ISA) for play­ing an ac­tive part in the Ye­men civil war.</p>
    <p>Sheik Heikel Khalid Bafana, 48, worked as a paid agent for a for­eign power while he was there, and was paid sub­stan­tial amounts for col­lect­ing in­tel­li­gence, the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment (ISD) said yes­ter­day. In do­ing so, he acted in a man­ner prej­u­di­cial to Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity and in­ter­ests, the agency said.</p>
    <p>Heikel was de­tained in March last year af­ter he re­turned to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, a 26-year-old Bangladesh­i con­struc­tion worker ar­rested un­der the ISA last month was is­sued a de­ten­tion or­der on Nov 30 to fa­cil­i­tate in­ves­ti­ga­tions into ter­ror­ism-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties, said the ISD.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­porean man has been de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act (ISA) for be­ing ac­tively in­volved in the civil war in Ye­men and for work­ing as a paid agent for a for­eign power while he was there, said the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment (ISD) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In do­ing so, Sheik Heikel Khalid Bafana, 48, who was de­tained in March last year, has acted in a man­ner prej­u­di­cial to Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity and in­ter­ests, the agency said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>ISD did not pro­vide de­tails on which fac­tion he backed or the for­eign coun­try he had worked for, cit­ing op­er­a­tional rea­sons.</p>
    <p>ISD also said it did not dis­close Heikel’s case ear­lier as in­ves­ti­ga­tions into his ac­tiv­i­ties in Ye­men were com­plex, and do­ing so would have jeop­ar­dised on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>ISD said it was pub­li­cis­ing Heikel’s case now “to un­der­line Sin­ga­pore’s stern stand against any­one who sup­ports, pro­motes, un­der­takes, or makes prepa­ra­tions to un­der­take armed vi­o­lence”.</p>
    <p>Heikel, a trained l awyer, mi­grated to Ye­men with his fam­ily around 2008 and ran a con­sul­tancy which ad­vised for­eign com­pa­nies on se­cu­rity risks and busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>ISD said he as­sisted one of the war­ring fac­tions and vol­un­teered to fight along­side it. He also acted as a bro­ker be­tween this fac­tion and the for­eign power, and sought to se­cure mil­i­tary equip­ment, sup­plies and funds to con­duct mil­i­tary train­ing.</p>
    <p>Heikel also col­lected in­tel­li­gence on Ye­men for this for­eign power from around 2012 to 2018, for which he was paid “sub­stan­tial amounts”, said ISD, adding that his deal­ings with the for­eign power were clan­des­tine.</p>
    <p>An ISD spokesman said in re­sponse to The Straits Times’ queries that Heikel first had the in­ten­tion to en­gage in armed vi­o­lence in 2017. He at­tracted ISD’s at­ten­tion as he had made so­cial me­dia posts sug­gest­ing he was in­volved in the con­flict.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, he had posted a pho­to­graph of him­self in mil­i­tary gear with a sub­ma­chine gun, as well as other post­ings sug­gest­ing in­volve­ment in or sup­port for armed vi­o­lence,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>On those who sup­port or un­der­take armed vi­o­lence, or make prepa­ra­tions to do so, ISD said: “Re­gard­less of how they ra­tio­nalise such vi­o­lence ide­o­log­i­cally, or where the vi­o­lence takes place, such a per­son has demon­strated a dan­ger­ous ten­dency to sup­port the use of vi­o­lence.”</p>
    <p>ISD added: “Heikel com­pounded this by serv­ing the in­ter­ests of a for­eign power for fi­nan­cial gain.” It noted that he had stayed on in Ye­men af­ter 2011 as the se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion de­te­ri­o­rated, even when other Sin­ga­pore­ans were evac­u­ated.</p>
    <p>Heikel was ar­rested un­der the ISA af­ter he and his fam­ily re­turned to Sin­ga­pore on Feb 5 last year. His fam­ily mem­bers have not been im­pli­cated in his ac­tiv­i­ties in Ye­men, added ISD.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, ISD also gave an up­date on rad­i­calised Bangladesh­i con­struc­tion worker Ahmed Faysal, 26, who had dis­sem­i­nated rad­i­cal pro­pa­ganda and bought fold­able knives for at­tacks against Hindu po­lice of­fi­cers back home.</p>
    <p>His ar­rest was an­nounced last month, and yes­ter­day, ISD said he was is­sued with a de­ten­tion or­der on Nov 30 to fa­cil­i­tate on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions into his ter­ror­ism-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Faysal was among 37 peo­ple in­ves­ti­gated af­ter the Home Team raised its se­cu­rity pos­ture in early Septem­ber fol­low­ing a spate of ter­ror at­tacks in France.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, ISD also an­nounced that three Sin­ga­pore­ans pre­vi­ously de­tained un­der the ISA have been re­leased and placed on Re­stric­tion Or­ders (ROs) that limit their ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>ROs for an­other five were al­lowed to lapse as they had shown good progress in re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Mo­hamed Ali, vice-chair­man of the Re­li­gious Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Group (RRG), said these de­vel­op­ments in­di­cate that Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach to re­ha­bil­i­tat­ing rad­i­calised per­sons and en­abling their even­tual rein­te­gra­tion is a vi­able way to counter ex­trem­ism and vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>“From my ex­pe­ri­ence as an RRG coun­sel­lor, the ISA has al­ways been used ju­di­ciously with due dili­gence and con­sid­er­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Early interventi­on has pre­vented many from be­ing fur­ther rad­i­calised, he noted, adding that the po­ten­tial or planned use of vi­o­lence is an ac­cepted cri­te­rion for some­one to be de­tained.</p>
    <p>“There can­not be any com­pro­mise as vi­o­lence is a vi­o­la­tion of the ba­sic hu­man right to feel safe,” he said.</p>
    <p>Heikel’s case was not dis­closed ear­lier be­cause in­ves­ti­ga­tions into his ac­tiv­i­ties in Ye­men were com­plex, and ear­lier dis­clo­sure would have jeop­ar­dised on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions. ISD is pub­li­cis­ing his case now to un­der­line Sin­ga­pore’s stern stand against any­one who sup­ports, pro­motes, un­der­takes, or makes prepa­ra­tions to un­der­take armed vi­o­lence... By in­volv­ing him­self in a for­eign armed con­flict and work­ing as a paid agent of a for­eign power, Heikel has acted in a man­ner prej­u­di­cial to Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity and in­ter­ests.</p>
