    <p>Hol­ly­wood stars Joaquin Phoenix, 45, and Rooney Mara, 35, have re­port­edly wel­comed a son named af­ter Phoenix’s late brother River.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian film-maker Vic­tor Kos­sakovsky an­nounced the news at a ques­tion-and-an­swer ses­sion at the Zurich Film Fes­ti­val, fol­low­ing a screen­ing of Gunda, a film which Phoenix worked on as an ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>Apol­o­gis­ing for Phoenix’s ab­sence at the fes­ti­val, Kos­sakovsky said: “He just got a baby. His name isRiver, so he can­not pro­mote it now.”</p>
    <p>The name River also be­longed to Phoenix’s late brother, who died of a drug over­dose in 1993 at the age of 23. River Phoenix, the star of films such as Stand By Me (1986) and My Own Pri­vate Idaho (1991), over­dosed out­side fa­mous night­club The Viper Room in West Hol­ly­wood. Joaquin, then 19, was with him at the time and called 911.</p>
    <p>When Joaquin Phoenix won the Best Ac­tor Os­car ear­lier this year for Joker (2019), he paid trib­ute to his brother by quot­ing the lyrics he wrote, which said “run to the res­cue with love and peace will fol­low”.</p>
    <p>Mara and Phoenix met on the 2013 film Her, but started dat­ing only in 2016, af­ter the film­ing of Mary Mag­da­lene. They con­firmed their en­gage­ment last year, but are yet to be mar­ried.</p>
    <p>There were ru­mours ear­lier that Mara was preg­nant.</p>
