    <p>• The seven mem­bers of South Korean boy group BTS are most com­fort­able when they are to­gether.</p>
    <p>In their two new Dy­na­mite mu­sic videos, each mem­ber had scenes that were shot in­di­vid­u­ally for their re­spec­tive solo parts, ac­cord­ing to South Korean pop-cul­ture news out­let Kore­aboo.</p>
    <p>Main vo­cal­ist Jung-kook (left), also known as the mak­nae (that is, the youngest per­son in the group), had his scenes shot in a retro bed­room, with posters of mu­si­cians plas­tered on the walls.</p>
    <p>While the 22-year-old l ooked re­laxed and con­fi­dent while per­form­ing, he re­vealed that it was not ac­tu­ally the case. In a new video posted on Thurs­day, the group re­acted to their first Dy­na­mite MV, which was re­leased on Aug 21.</p>
    <p>Jung-kook said he had a “hard time shoot­ing this scene”.</p>
    <p>RM shared that his band­mate had to do mul­ti­ple takes, while Suga said: “Jung-kook doesn’t do his best work when he’s alone.”</p>
    <p>Jung-kook agreed, ad­mit­ting: “I freeze up when I’m put in the spot­light.</p>
    <p>“You know how the cam­eras were static and I had to do the scene alone? It was re­ally tough, so the morn­ing shoot got pushed back to the very last. I was the first one there and the last one out.”</p>
    <p>He added: “I don’t think I was feel­ing my best. I wasn’t feel­ing so hot.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, his band­mates begged to dif­fer. J-Hope said that de­spite the dif­fi­cul­ties, the scene turned out well.</p>
    <p>“But you look great here,” he told Jung-kook.</p>
