    <p>When Tampines Rovers played matches be­hind closed doors af­ter the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) restarted on Oct 17, Bren­don Tan would sup­port his team from van­tage points out­side the sta­dium.</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle the 24-year-old un­der­grad­u­ate will not do for the Stags, and un­der­go­ing a free anti­gen rapid test cer­tainly is not one of them. “It’s a mi­nor in­con­ve­nience,” he said af­ter get­ting his neg­a­tive re­sult for the coro­n­avirus in­side 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Tan was one of 200 fans who watched Tampines draw 1-1 against Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional at Our Tampines Hub yes­ter­day even­ing. While the sea­son fi­nale was a pilot test for sup­port­ers, it was also an acid test for die-hard fans.</p>
    <p>With tick­ets al­lo­cated on a first-come-first-serve ba­sis, Tan snagged his within half an hour of the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>The sup­port­ers made them­selves heard in the stands – even if the usual drum beats did not fill the air as in­stru­ments were not al­lowed as part of Covid-19 mea­sures in the first SPL game with fans since March.</p>
    <p>For Stags sup­port­ers, it was a bitterswee­t oc­ca­sion as the draw ended their ti­tle hopes. That re­sult, cou­pled with a 1-0 win for Al­birex Ni­igata over Hougang United at Hougang Sta­dium, saw the Ja­panese out­fit lift their fourth SPL tro­phy in five sea­sons.</p>
    <p>Gey­lang took the lead in the 24th minute when Barry Maguire planted a fine header past Syazwan Buhari from Fa­reez Farhan’s corner. As the clock ticked down, Tampines poured for­ward re­lent­lessly and 36-year-old de­fender Bai­hakki Khaizan equalised with a header from Ir­wan Shah’s free kick with 10 min­utes to go.</p>
    <p>There were mo­ments when ten­sions ran high, in­clud­ing an in­ci­dent af­ter the match that saw Gey­lang’s Fir­daus Kas­man shown a red card.</p>
    <p>Tampines coach Gavin Lee praised his play­ers’ in­domitable spir­its and also paid trib­ute to the fans for their sup­port.</p>
    <p>“I’m very proud of the play­ers to main­tain that kind of in­ten­sity and search for the win­ning goal,” said the 30-year-old. “For them to go out there and do what they did, it was only be­cause of fans cheer­ing. With­out them, you wouldn’t see the fin­ish of a game like this.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing made his­tory by qual­i­fy­ing for the group stage of next sea­son’s AFC Cham­pi­ons League, where they could com­pete against top teams from coun­tries such as Ja­pan, China and South Korea, Lee knows next sea­son will be chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “We got very close (this sea­son). There are pe­ri­ods we could have done bet­ter, it is just our job now to an­a­lyse and re­flect and do bet­ter.”</p>
