        World | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 2, 2020 | A18 Plagued by scandals PARK WON-SOON, 64 Former Seoul mayor Once a presidenti­al hopeful and highly respected for his work in fighting for women’s rights as a lawyer, Mr Park was accused by his former secretary on July 8 of inappropri­ate touching, including kissing her knee that she had bruised, and of asking her to hold him while he was resting in bed in his private office. He also allegedly sent her suggestive text messages and semi-naked photos of himself. AHN HEE-JUNG, 55 Former South Chungcheon­g governor Ahn was tipped to be a potential successor to President Moon Jaein. A self-professed “feminist”, Ahn quit after a former secretary accused him on TV in March 2018 of raping her four times and sexually harassing her on several other occasions. He was sentenced to 31/ years in jail for sexual assault in February last year. 2 LEE JAE-MYUNG, 55 Gyeonggi governor Rumours first circulated in 2010 that Mr Lee, who has been married since 1991, had an affair with actress Kim Boo-sun in 2007. Kim confirmed the rumours in 2018 ahead of provincial elections, which saw Mr Lee running for Gyeonggi governorsh­ip. Critics attacked him and asked him to bow out of the race, but he was elected anyway. He is now seen as a potential candidate for the next presidenti­al election. Chang May Choon New documents show Epstein gave Maxwell advice in 2015 Rupert Murdoch’s son quits News Corp board Maxwell argued that it could destroy her ability to get a fair trial. The oral argument for her appeal is scheduled for Sept 22.
Maxwell is accused of grooming girls as young as 14 to be abused by Epstein. Victims say they were farmed out to some of his wealthy associates. She is also accused of sometimes participat­ing in the abuse.
She faces six counts, including perjury, and up to 35 years in prison if convicted.
In a separate unsealed document, lawyers for three alleged victims claimed Epstein used his connection­s to powerful men – including Prince Andrew – to apply pressure on the US authoritie­s to avoid more serious federal charges for his sex crimes in 2008.
Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges of soliciting prostituti­on from minors and then received unusually lenient terms for his imprisonme­nt in Palm Beach County, where he was allowed out to work in his office six days a week.
He was arrested in July last year over a case filed in New York in which he faced sex traffickin­g charges for abusing women and girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005.
Last August, a federal appeals court released at least 2,000 pages of evidence, including testimony from Ms Giuffre and some of Epstein’s employees. A day later, the 66-year-old financier was found hanged in his jail cell. • Mr James Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch and one-time heir of the family media empire, has resigned from the board of News Corp, citing disagreeme­nts over editorial content at the company, the parent of The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and the New York Post.
“My resignatio­n is due to disagreeme­nts over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions,” the 47-yearold said in a resignatio­n letter on Friday.
He was chief executive of the family’s main media business – then called 21st Century Fox – until last year, but he stepped down when most of its assets were sold to Disney.
Since then, he and his family have increasing­ly gone their separate ways – and he has become more critical of the conservati­ve-leaning editorial direction at News Corp and Fox’s news channel.
In recent weeks, tensions have grown over the WSJ’s opinion section, known for editorials promoting free markets and conservati­ve principles.
Last month, journalist­s at the paper demanded a clearer distinctio­n between news and opinion.
They were worried about the opinion section’s accuracy and transparen­cy and did not want readers to think it was straight news.
The editorial board responded in a note to readers, saying it would not “wilt under cancel-culture pressure”.
“As long as our proprietor­s allow us the privilege to do so, the opinion pages will continue to publish contributo­rs who speak their minds,” the editorial board said.
“And these columns will continue to promote the principles of free people and free markets, which are more important than ever in what is a culture of growing progressiv­e conformity and intoleranc­e.” NEW YORK • Disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein was offering advice to Ghislaine Maxwell as late as 2015, according to newly unsealed documents, despite her lawyer’s statement that the British socialite had “no contact” with him in a decade.
“You have done nothing wrong and I would urge you to start acting like it,” Epstein wrote in a January 2015 e-mail to Maxwell, a former girlfriend who said she ran his many properties for years. “Go outside, head high, not as an escaping convict. Go to parties. Deal with it.”
The e-mails between them include what appears to be advice on what Maxwell should say in response to Ms Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that they had recruited her into a sex-traffickin­g ring when she was 16 and farmed her out to the rich and powerful, including Britain’s Prince Andrew.
Maxwell had publicly lashed out at the claims and Epstein seemed to suggest that she should distance herself from him. He had reached a secret plea deal with Florida state prosecutor­s in 2008.
“I have never been a party in any criminal action pertaining to JE,” Epstein suggested that Maxwell NEW YORK say, referring to himself. He also suggested she say: “At the time of Jeffrey’s plea deal, I was involved in a very long-term committed relationsh­ip with another man and no longer working for Jeffrey.”
The e-mails were included in unredacted court documents released on Thursday.
They were from a 2015 defamation case that Ms Giuffre brought against Maxwell, after the latter denounced her claims as “obvious lies”.
Maxwell, 58, was charged last month with sex traffickin­g of underage girls with Epstein and perjury. She pleaded not guilty.
In an unsuccessf­ul bid to have Maxwell released on bail, her lawyers claimed in a court filing that “she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade”.
More documents are expected to be released tomorrow, except a 2016 deposition about Maxwell’s sex life which contains potentiall­y embarrassi­ng informatio­n.
