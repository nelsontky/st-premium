    <p>I have a sug­ges­tion for MP Louis Ng re­gard­ing com­plaints about sec­ond-hand smoke from res­i­dents (GPC calls for ban on smok­ing at win­dows or bal­conies at home,</p>
    <p>Oct 6).</p>
    <p>There are cig­a­rettes that do not burn, hence no sec­ond-hand smoke will be pro­duced. These are not to be con­fused with the va­p­ing e-cig­a­rettes, which are cur­rently banned here.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, South Korea, Malaysia and Viet­nam, just to name a few coun­tries, have al­ready le­galised the sale of heat-not-burn to­bacco sticks. Why is Sin­ga­pore ban­ning these just be­cause the heat­ing mech­a­nism is elec­tric and thus clas­si­fied un­der e-cig­a­rettes?</p>
    <p>These heated sticks are the best com­pro­mise: there is neg­li­gi­ble smell, no ash, no fire and no sec­ond-hand smoke from a lit stick.</p>
    <p>I hope the au­thor­i­ties can re­visit this op­tion, in­stead of ban­ning res­i­dents from smok­ing at the win­dows or bal­conies of their homes, as sug­gested by the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>We all want to do what we want and it is hu­man to ar­gue for one’s rights. As we can­not please ev­ery­body, we need to com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>Where is the right of the cit­i­zen to be se­cure and able to do what he wants freely in his own home and not be sub­ject to pro­hi­bi­tions and in­tru­sions?</p>
    <p>Please do not take a heavy-handed ap­proach to smok­ers as they form part of the Sin­ga­pore com­mu­nity as well.</p>
    <p>If Mr Ng has to ban some­thing, per­haps he could con­sider ban­ning walk­ing while smok­ing. That, to me, is jus­ti­fi­able.</p>
    <p>Look to Ja­pan and its smok­ing laws – a won­der­ful model of com­pro­mise.</p>
