    <p>Malaysians’ sour­ing view of the gov­ern­ment’s role in the resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus out­break has led to calls for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to step down. This comes amid per­sis­tent claims by op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim that the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) ad­min­is­tra­tion has lost its par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Just three hours af­ter Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s tele­vised ad­dress on Tues­day evening urg­ing peo­ple to abide by rules to curb the new Covid-19 wave, #Muhyid­dinOut be­came the top trend­ing hash­tag among Malaysian Twit­ter users.</p>
    <p>It was at No. 2 – be­hind Korean-turned-Man­dopop su­per­star Lay Zhang’s birth­day – yes­ter­day af­ter­noon as Malaysians sig­nalled their frus­tra­tions over daily new in­fec­tions re­peat­edly break­ing all-time highs in the past week.</p>
    <p>While some crit­i­cised the hash­tag as short­sighted and un­fair to the PM, most were in­censed by his de­nial of dou­ble stan­dards that favour mem­bers of the ad­min­is­tra­tion in en­forc­ing rules men­tioned in his speech.</p>
    <p>A tweet by @michelele­hhh, point­ing out how a nasi kan­dar op­er­a­tor was fined RM12,000 (S$4,000) and jailed for five months for break­ing home quar­an­tine while Plan­ta­tion Industries and Com­modi­ties Min­is­ter Khairud­din Aman Razali was fined only RM1,000, gar­nered more than 11,000 shares as of last night.</p>
    <p>In his ad­dress, Mr Muhyid­din ex­horted the na­tion to abide by stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures (SOPs) and gov­ern­ment or­ders by in­sist­ing that pun­ish­ment would be meted out “with­out re­gard for rank and sta­tus”.</p>
    <p>“Sorry if Daddy has to use the cane (rotan)!” he said, mak­ing a ref­er­ence to the “Abah” (Malay for father) moniker he has gained among Malaysians since tak­ing power in March.</p>
    <p>But some Malaysians ex­pressed dis­gust at the light-hearted ref­er­ence in a speech ad­dress­ing a dis­ease that has af­flicted 13,504 and killed 141 peo­ple in the coun­try. The words Abah and rotan were also trend­ing un­til yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>“It has been eight months since Covid19 came to Malaysia and all we get from our PM to­day is</p>
    <p>‘abah rotan nanti’. Mind u, a one-year-old baby died to­day in Sabah. The death could have been avoided if there is no dou­ble stan­dard and changes in SOPs,” said Twit­ter user @neur__ in a post that has been “liked” more than 1,400 times.</p>
    <p>While the op­po­si­tion pre­dictably called on the PM to whip his own min­is­ters first, the sen­ti­ment was sur­pris­ingly echoed by the Malaysian Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion, a mem­ber of the rul­ing pact.</p>
    <p>“If the pub­lic is be­ing fined RM1,000 just for slightly pulling down their mask for a moment, yet min­is­ters are get­ting away with it for ob­vi­ously flout­ing the SOP, are we not ashamed when we make bold claims of ‘No Dou­ble Stan­dards’? If Abah wants to ‘rotan’ the wrong­do­ers, start with those on top, and those at the bot­tom will fol­low will­ingly,” said its spokesman Mike Chong.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s ap­proval rating has stood at above 70 per cent up un­til Au­gust, on the back of 93 per cent sat­is­fac­tion with the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of Covid-19. But with daily cases hit­ting new all-time highs on four of the past six days (peak­ing at 691 on Tues­day) and ex­pected to breach 1,000 by this week­end, pub­lic opinion has started to turn.</p>
    <p>“A sus­tained surge of cases would un­der­mine (Mr Muhyid­din’s) le­git­i­macy at a time of con­tin­ued po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity in Malaysia,” risk con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group’s Asia di­rec­tor Peter Mum­ford told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>De­spite his coali­tion – whose</p>
    <p>113 MPs hold a wafer-thin ma­jor­ity in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment – wrest­ing con­trol of Sabah in the Sept 26 polls, grum­bles from his largest ally Umno have peaked af­ter it ceded the state’s chief min­is­ter­ship to the Prime Min­is­ter’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing ten­sion be­tween Umno and Ber­satu also co­in­cides with Datuk Seri An­war claim­ing on Sept 23 that he had gar­nered a “for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity” but not re­veal­ing who had de­fected from PN.</p>
    <p>Top lead­ers from his Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat told The Straits Times that Mr An­war briefed MPs from the party this week that he would soon present proof to the King, but of­fered them no con­crete de­tails.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign­ing across Sabah – home to sev­eral in­fec­tion clus­ters at the time – last month also saw many politi­cians from the rul­ing pact bring­ing the virus back to the penin­sula. This has stirred up pub­lic anger over PN’s move to en­gi­neer de­fec­tions in July which trig­gered the vote, and many com­mu­nity in­fec­tions in the cur­rent wave are be­ing mock­ingly re­ferred to as the “min­is­ters clus­ter”.</p>
    <p>De facto Is­lamic Af­fairs</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Zulk­i­fli Mo­hamad tested pos­i­tive on Mon­day af­ter at­tend­ing a Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil meet­ing two days ear­lier, leav­ing a host of top of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Mr Muhyid­din and four senior min­is­ters in quar­an­tine un­til the end of next week.</p>
