    <p>Malaysia’s rul­ing par­ties are at odds over which flag to fly at polls ex­pected as early as the end of the year, with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion yet to be reg­is­tered as an of­fi­cial en­tity.</p>
    <p>At stake are not just which sym­bols and lo­gos would be more pop­u­lar with vot­ers, but also who ul­ti­mately signs off on can­di­dates for 222 par­lia­men­tary and up to 587 state seats that are up for grabs.</p>
    <p>Umno lead­ers have pointed to a slew of re­cent by-elec­tion vic­to­ries un­der the ex­ist­ing Barisan Na­sional (BN) flag that most par­ties cur­rently in gov­ern­ment have used for nearly half a cen­tury, in­sist­ing that the party should re­tain the widely recog­nised “scale” logo, which sym­bol­ises fair­ness and equal­ity.</p>
    <p>The chair­man of the BN coali­tion – which was in power for decades un­til its shock de­feat at the 2018 elec­tion – is Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, and the po­si­tion gives him mas­sive in­flu­ence on on­go­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions, as the rul­ing par­ties pre­pare for elec­tions to end the in­sta­bil­ity stem­ming from the slimmest ma­jor­ity a Malaysian gov­ern­ment has ever held.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one wants the fi­nal say on can­di­dates. For ex­am­ple, former BN par­ties in Sarawak and Sabah that broke away after 2018 no longer need the BN chief’s sig­na­ture. But then what logo are they go­ing to use when their supporters have al­ways voted for the scales?” a PN of­fi­cial told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But Umno has also inked an of­fi­cial po­lit­i­cal pact with the Is­lamist Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS): The Muafakat Na­sional (MN) pact be­tween the na­tion’s largest party and its former neme­sis has been cred­ited with gal­vanis­ing the Malay ma­jor­ity and de­liv­er­ing vic­to­ries to BN can­di­dates in all but one of seven by-elec­tions since last year.</p>
    <p>It is un­likely that the rul­ing PN will go into elec­tions un­der the MN as non-Malay par­ties would baulk at the sug­ges­tion. But the al­liance, aimed at cham­pi­oning Malay and Is­lamic in­ter­ests, meets reg­u­larly and has co­or­di­nated its ma­chiner­ies at the grass­roots, mak­ing it a pow­er­ful force at the bar­gain­ing ta­bles.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia is</p>
    <p>LOGO DILEMMA</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one wants the fi­nal say on can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, former Barisan Na­sional (BN) par­ties in Sarawak and Sabah that broke away after 2018 no longer need the BN chief’s sig­na­ture. But then what logo are they go­ing to use when their supporters have al­ways ’’ voted for the scales?</p>
    <p>A PERIKATAN NA­SIONAL OF­FI­CIAL, re­fer­ring to the Barisan Na­sional coali­tion’s “scale” logo.</p>
    <p>push­ing hard for PN to be­come a reg­is­tered coali­tion, os­ten­si­bly with the Premier as its chief.</p>
    <p>But early this month, Umno deputy pres­i­dent Mo­hamad Hasan re­vealed that the three Malay par­ties have set up a com­mit­tee to look into options such as Ber­satu join­ing MN, with PN as a grand coali­tion along with part­ners in Sabah and Sarawak.</p>
    <p>“At the very lat­est, polls should be held by the end of the year. Do we have enough time to come up with a new logo in five months? Let’s not trou­ble our­selves. The eas­i­est is to use what is al­ready avail­able and just pol­ish up the brand­ing,” said Datuk Seri Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>On July 12, Umno ad­vi­sory coun­cil chair­man Tengku Raza­leigh Hamzah said many of the party’s MPs “are not agree­able (to reg­is­ter­ing PN) as they are used to BN”.</p>
    <p>This comes as seat ne­go­ti­a­tions are heat­ing up – Umno, Ber­satu and PAS rep­re­sen­ta­tives met on Tues­day to duke it out over over­lap­ping claims in at least a quar­ter of con­stituen­cies dom­i­nated by the Malay ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Whether Umno and PAS go their own way or fall un­der a Muhyid­din­led um­brella could very well be a key bar­gain­ing chip in how th­ese seats are al­lo­cated.</p>
