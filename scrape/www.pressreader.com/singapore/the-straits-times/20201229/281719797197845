    <p>•</p>
    <p>The 10 costli­est weather dis­as­ters world­wide this year saw in­sured dam­ages worth US$150 bil­lion (S$200 bil­lion), top­ping the fig­ure for last year and re­flect­ing a long-term im­pact of global warm­ing, ac­cord­ing to a re­port re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The same dis­as­ters claimed at least 3,500 lives and dis­placed more than 13.5 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>From Aus­tralia’s out-of-con­trol wild­fires in Jan­uary to a record num­ber of At­lantic hur­ri­canes through last month, the true cost of the year’s climate-en­hanced calami­ties was in fact far higher be­cause most losses were unin­sured.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, the bur­den fell dis­pro­por­tion­ately on poor na­tions, ac­cord­ing to the an­nual tally from global non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion Chris­tian Aid in a re­port en­ti­tled Count The Cost Of 2020: A Year Of Climate Break­down.</p>
    <p>Only 4 per cent of eco­nomic losses from climate-im­pacted ex­treme events in low-in­come coun­tries were in­sured, com­pared with 60 per cent in high-in­come economies, the re­port said, cit­ing a study last month in The Lancet.</p>
    <p>Chris­tian Aid’s climate pol­icy lead Kat Kramer said: “Whether floods in Asia, lo­custs in Africa, or storms in Europe and the Amer­i­cas, climate change has con­tin­ued to rage in 2020.”</p>
    <p>Ex­treme weather dis­as­ters have plagued hu­man­ity long be­fore man­made global warm­ing be­gan to mess with the planet’s climate sys­tem. But more than a cen­tury of tem­per­a­ture and pre­cip­i­ta­tion data, and decades of satel­lite data on hur­ri­canes and sea level rise, have left no doubt that the earth’s warm­ing sur­face tem­per­a­ture is am­pli­fy­ing their im­pact.</p>
    <p>Mas­sive trop­i­cal storms – var­i­ously known as hur­ri­canes, ty­phoons and cy­clones – are now more likely to be stronger, last longer, carry more wa­ter and wan­der beyond their his­tor­i­cal range.</p>
    <p>This year’s record-break­ing 30 named At­lantic hur­ri­canes – with at least 400 fa­tal­i­ties and US$41 bil­lion in dam­ages – sug­gest the world could see more such storms.</p>
    <p>The World Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Or­gan­i­sa­tion had to use Greek sym­bols to name storms, after run­ning out of letters in the Latin al­pha­bet.</p>
    <p>In­tense sum­mer flood­ing in China and In­dia, where the mon­soon sea­son brought ab­nor­mal amounts of rain­fall for the sec­ond year run­ning, are also con­sis­tent with pro­jec­tions on how climate change will im­pact pre­cip­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Five of the most costly ex­treme weather events this year were re­lated to Asia’s un­usu­ally rainy mon­soon.</p>
    <p>“The 2020 flood was one of the worst in the his­tory of Bangladesh – more than a quar­ter of the coun­try was un­der wa­ter,” said Mr Shah­ja­han Mon­dal, direc­tor of the In­sti­tute of Flood and Wa­ter Man­age­ment at Bangladesh Univer­sity of Engi­neer­ing and Tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Wild­fires that scorched record ar­eas in Cal­i­for­nia, Aus­tralia and even Rus­sia’s Siberian hin­ter­land, much of it within the Arc­tic Cir­cle, are also con­sis­tent with a warmer world, and are pre­dicted to get worse as tem­per­a­tures climb.</p>
    <p>The planet’s av­er­age sur­face tem­per­a­ture has gone up at least 1.1 deg C on av­er­age com­pared with the late 19th cen­tury, with much of that warm­ing oc­cur­ring in the last half-cen­tury.</p>
    <p>The 2015 Paris Agree­ment en­joins the world’s na­tions to col­lec­tively cap global warm­ing at “well be­low” 2 deg C, and even 1.5 deg C if fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>A landmark re­port in 2018 from the UN In­tergovern­men­tal Panel on Climate Change’s climate science ad­vi­sory panel showed that 1.5 deg C is a safer thresh­old, but the like­li­hood of staying be­low it has grown van­ish­ingly small, ac­cord­ing to many ex­perts.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, the im­pacts of climate change will be felt via the ex­tremes, and not av­er­age changes,” noted Dr Sarah Perkins-Kil­patrick, a se­nior lec­turer at the Univer­sity of New South Wales’ Climate Change Re­search Cen­tre.</p>
