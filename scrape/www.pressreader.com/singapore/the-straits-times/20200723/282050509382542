    <p>The new Work­ers’ Party-run Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC) will take over the man­age­ment of a law­suit ini­ti­ated by the Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC), the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND) con­firmed yesterday.</p>
    <p>PRPTC had filed the on­go­ing civil suit to re­cover al­leged losses in­curred by the former Pung­gol East SMC, which is now part of Sengkang GRC and re­turned to WP hands at the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The trans­fer of the law­suit will take effect at the end of this month, when the new town coun­cils are formed fol­low­ing an of­fi­cial dec­la­ra­tion by the Min­is­ter of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, MND added.</p>
    <p>This means the WP team in Sengkang will take on the re­spon­si­bil­ity of han­dling the law­suit, which was brought by PRPTC against WP chair­man Sylvia Lim, former party chief Low Thia Khi­ang and six other de­fen­dants in the High Court.</p>
    <p>MND said: “As the former Pung­gol East SMC has be­come a part of Sengkang GRC, its rights and du­ties, in­clud­ing the man­age­ment of the law­suit ini­ti­ated by PRPTC, will be handed over to the new town coun­cil.” It added that it was un­able to com­ment on spe­cific le­gal ac­tions or ar­range­ments, which are the pre­rog­a­tive of the re­spec­tive town coun­cils, as it is not a party to the suit.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen if Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, who has been rep­re­sent­ing PRPTC in the law­suit, will con­tinue to rep­re­sent the new Sengkang Town Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The WP and Mr Singh’s law firm, Davin­der Singh Cham­bers, did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment yesterday.</p>
    <p>PRPTC’s civil suit came after the WP-run Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil (AHTC) had taken the same de­fen­dants to court.</p>
    <p>Pung­gol East was man­aged by AHTC from 2013 to 2015. In GE2015, the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party won back the sin­gle seat. It be­came part of Sengkang GRC when elec­toral bound­aries were re­drawn ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>PRPTC and the WP town coun­cil­lors are ap­peal­ing against a High Court judg­ment which ruled, among other things, that Ms Lim and Mr Low had breached their fidu­ciary du­ties to the town coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The sums payable to the plain­tiffs will be as­sessed sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor of Law Ben­jamin Ong from the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity said SKTC could in the­ory ap­ply to the court to dis­con­tinue the claim en­tirely.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, be­cause the pro­ceed­ings are at such a late stage, SKTC would re­quire the court’s per­mis­sion to dis­con­tinue the suit,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther, the court would be able to im­pose con­di­tions on the dis­con­tin­u­ance.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ong added that even if the court al­lows the suit to be dis­con­tin­ued, it could still be left open for SKTC to restart pro­ceed­ings against the de­fen­dants later on.</p>
    <p>Out­lin­ing some pos­si­ble sce­nar­ios, he said SKTC might agree to ap­point an in­de­pen­dent panel which will be em­pow­ered to carry on the lit­i­ga­tion on its be­half, and fur­ther agree not to in­ter­fere with this lit­i­ga­tion, sim­i­lar to what AHTC did.</p>
    <p>The Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment may also have the power to or­der SKTC to re­sume pro­ceed­ings un­der Sec­tion 43D of the Town Coun­cils Act, he said, adding that this is spec­u­la­tion on his part.</p>
    <p>“I say it is pos­si­ble be­cause, as far as I know, Sec­tion 43D, which was in­tro­duced in 2017, has never been used be­fore, so the pre­cise scope of the min­is­ter’s pow­ers un­der Sec­tion 43D has yet to be pro­nounced on au­thor­i­ta­tively by the courts.”</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, it is also pos­si­ble the min­is­ter makes fi­nan­cial grants to SKTC con­di­tional on it re­sum­ing pro­ceed­ings against the de­fen­dants or, de­pend­ing on the tim­ing of the grant, con­di­tional on SKTC not dis­con­tin­u­ing the civil suit in the first place, Prof Ong said.</p>
