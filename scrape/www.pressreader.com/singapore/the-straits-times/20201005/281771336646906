    <p>Bangkok karaoke bar man­ager Thi­tikorn Rat­ta­narak had to pull part-time shifts at her lo­cal 7-Eleven store when Thai­land or­dered nightspots shut ear­lier this year to con­tain the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>When bars re­opened, bor­der closures con­tin­ued to shut out most of her pa­trons, who are Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>Yet she hes­i­tates when asked if Thai­land should open its door wider to for­eign ar­rivals.</p>
    <p>“Maybe next year,” she tells The Straits Times. “It’s okay. It’s just an­other three to four months”.</p>
    <p>Fears about a sec­ond Covid-19 wave scut­tled the gov­ern­ment’s so-called “Safe and Sealed” pro­posal to restart the king­dom’s bat­tered tourism in­dus­try by iso­lat­ing fresh vis­i­tors in a 1km zone around des­ig­nated re­sorts. The idea was to let sun seek­ers spend their 14-day quar­an­tine on a beach in Phuket, where the scheme would first be launched.</p>
    <p>But peo­ple in Phuket shot it down.</p>
    <p>“We learnt a les­son. (Dur­ing the first wave,) when peo­ple learnt you came from Phuket, they were re­luc­tant to talk to you,” Phuket Tourist As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Bhummikitt­i Ruktaengam tells The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple from other prov­inces would not wel­come Phuket peo­ple if we al­lowed in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors in quar­an­tine to move around in the ‘safe’ area and mix with lo­cals.”</p>
    <p>To­day, the Thai gov­ern­ment is try­ing in­stead to en­tice high-spend­ing tourists with a long-stay visa plan that would al­low them to stay for up to</p>
    <p>270 days, while also not budg­ing from the 14-day quar­an­tine re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has gone for four weeks with­out lo­cal trans­mis­sion, but its econ­omy is pro­jected by the World Bank to shrink at least 8.3 per cent this year, mak­ing it the worst per­former in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Su­pant Mongkol­suthree,</p>
    <p>chair­man of the Fed­er­a­tion of Thai Industries, blames the wary pub­lic sen­ti­ment on gov­ern­ment com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“What’s cru­cial is com­mu­ni­cat­ing the pos­i­tive as­pects, like num­bers of vis­i­tors who have ar­rived with­out prob­lem,” he tells The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“So far, we have fo­cused mostly on neg­a­tive in­for­ma­tion, like num­bers of pa­tients and the im­pact on the econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cals worry a sec­ond wave could put Thai­land in a lock­down it may never re­cover eco­nom­i­cally from. But nearby Viet­nam has shown that a resur­gence can be man­aged suc­cess­fully.</p>
    <p>Like Thai­land, Viet­nam has gone for four weeks with­out new com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion. The tal­lies have re­mained un­changed at 1,096 con­firmed cases and 35 deaths.</p>
    <p>LES­SON LEARNT</p>
    <p>While it has not re­opened the door to in­ter­na­tional tourists, it has restarted in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial flights, and ex­empted from quar­an­tine se­lect groups of for­eign ex­perts and in­vestors com­ing for short vis­its, if they fol­low strict health mea­sures.</p>
    <p>De­spite the hit Viet­nam has taken from the global slow­down, its econ­omy is show­ing enough re­silience to make it the bright­est spot in South-east Asia. The gov­ern­ment says its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct grew 2.12 per cent from Jan­uary to last month, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. The World Bank ex­pects Viet­nam’s econ­omy to post full-year growth of 2.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Viet­namese were less fear­ful dur­ing the sec­ond wave be­cause the gov­ern­ment had con­tained the first ef­fec­tively, says Dr Le Thai Ha, a re­search di­rec­tor at Ful­bright</p>
    <p>Univer­sity Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>“When we trust the gov­ern­ment, we feel more con­fi­dent to go out, we are more ready to spend and busi­nesses are ready to in­vest,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Thai­land, like Viet­nam, has the ca­pac­ity to bounce back from a sec­ond wave, says Dr Bir­git Hansl, the World Bank’s coun­try man­ager in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“It has ex­pe­ri­ence suc­cess­fully con­tain­ing the epi­demic. If the sec­ond wave hits, it could again suc­cess­fully con­tain it and not risk ex­ten­sive mea­sures of lock­down that ac­tu­ally then have a stronger eco­nomic im­pact.”</p>
    <p>The big­ger ques­tion is how it can con­vince peo­ple of the cal­cu­lated risks that need to be taken to re­open bor­ders and jump-start the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>We learnt a les­son. (Dur­ing the first wave,) when peo­ple learnt you came from Phuket, they were re­luc­tant to talk to you. Peo­ple from other prov­inces would not wel­come Phuket peo­ple if we al­lowed in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors in quar­an­tine to move around in the ‘safe’ area and mix with lo­cals.</p>
