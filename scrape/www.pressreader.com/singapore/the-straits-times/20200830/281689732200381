    <p>JAKARTA • In­done­sia’s ef­forts to re­vive the econ­omy took a stum­ble as coro­n­avirus out­breaks forced fac­to­ries in one of its big­gest man­u­fac­tur­ing hubs to shut.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s LG Elec­tron­ics, and Ja­pan’s Suzuki Mo­tor and NOK Corp were told to stop op­er­at­ing their fa­cil­i­ties in Cikarang, West Java, af­ter more than 300 work­ers i n the i ndus­trial area tested pos­i­tive for the new coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent J oko Wi­dodo has sought to turn the pan­demic into an op­por­tu­nity to set In­done­sia on a path to­wards be­com­ing a de­vel­oped coun­try.</p>
    <p>He pledged to ramp up state spend­ing af­ter the econ­omy fell into its first con­trac­tion in more than 20 years.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the new clus­ters and the ris­ing num­ber of in­fec­tions may keep of­fices and fac­to­ries shut while con­sumers are opt­ing to stay home.</p>
    <p>“The pro­longed lo­cal out­break re­mains a ma­jor risk to the re­cov­ery, es­pe­cially be­cause eco­nomic cen­tres are still hot spots,” No­mura Sin­ga­pore econ­o­mists Euben Paracuelle­s and Rangga Cipta wrote in a re­port.</p>
    <p>“This will keep house­holds and busi­nesses cau­tious even if no lock­down is re­in­stated.”</p>
    <p>In­done­sia re­ported its big­gest rise in new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions for a third suc­ces­sive day yes­ter­day, the health min­istry web­site showed. Yes­ter­day’s 3,308 cases take In­done­sia’s tally of in­fec­tions to 169,195, while 92 new deaths car­ried its toll to 7,261.</p>
    <p>The surge in new cases could keep in­vestors and In­done­sians with higher spend­ing power wary, said Mr David Su­mual, chief econ­o­mist at PT Bank Cen­tral Asia.</p>
    <p>Spend­ing by such con­sumers would oth­er­wise bring a sig­nif­i­cant mul­ti­plier ef­fect to the econ­omy as they make big­ger pur­chases, he added.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing con­trib­utes nearly 20 per cent to gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, while house­hold con­sump­tion ac­counts for about 60 per cent.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal Jakarta, which boasts the high­est con­cen­tra­tion of wealth, de­cided to ex­tend so­ciald­is­tanc­ing mea­sures through Sept 10 and keep cin­e­mas shut.</p>
    <p>“Test­ing, trac­ing and iso­la­tion should be­come the ba­sis for pol­i­cy­mak­ing,” said Ms Nu­rul Na­dia Lun­tun­gan, a pub­lic health ex­pert at the Cen­tre for In­done­sia’s Strate­gic De­vel­op­ment Ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>An on-off re­stric­tion pol­icy must be car­ried out un­til a vac­cine is dis­cov­ered, she said.</p>
