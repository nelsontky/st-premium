    <p>The highly an­tic­i­pated sci­encefic­tion movie Tenet earned $763,765 in its open­ing week­end in Sin­ga­pore, a fig­ure that shows strong, though not record-break­ing, au­di­ence in­ter­est in a film that is the fore­run­ner for a slate of de­layed ma­jor Hol­ly­wood re­leases.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure re­flects tak­ings across 130 screens, from last Wed­nes­day to Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Tenet’s box of­fice take is less than that of South Korean zom­bie ac­tion movie Train To Bu­san: Penin­sula, which picked up $962,000 in its open­ing week­end, from July 16 to 19, days af­ter the re­open­ing of cin­e­mas on July 13.</p>
    <p>Movie halls had closed from March 27 to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Tenet tops the week­end box of­fice list, fol­lowed by su­per­hero movie The New Mu­tants. The dis­trib­u­tor of the lat­ter film, The Walt Dis­ney Com­pany, has yet to re­ply to a Straits Times re­quest for box­of­fice fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg re­ported that Tenet was the big­gest pic­ture glob­ally, tak­ing in US$53.6 mil­lion (S$72.7 mil­lion) over the week­end across 41 in­ter­na­tional mar­kets. It will not open un­til next week in the United States, where The New Mu­tants de­buted at No. 1 with US$7 mil­lion in tak­ings.</p>
    <p>Cin­ema seat­ing in Sin­ga­pore is sub­ject to so­cial-dis­tanc­ing rules that have lim­ited ca­pac­ity to about 25 per cent. An­other fac­tor that might have re­stricted tak­ings for Tenet is its l en­gth, which re­duces the num­ber of screen­ings that can be held each day. It clocks in at 150 min­utes, while Bu­san is more than 30 min­utes shorter, at 116 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Tenet, from writer-di­rec­tor Christo­pher Nolan (space ad­ven­ture In­ter­stel­lar, 2014; heist film In­cep­tion, 2010), is the first ma­jor-bud­get Western film to land in Sin­ga­pore in a sea­son that has seen re­leases of block­busters moved to later this year or next year.</p>
    <p>The ac­tion-thriller stars John David Wash­ing­ton, Robert Pat­tin­son and El­iz­a­beth De­bicki in an ad­ven­ture that takes place across op­pos­ing time streams.</p>
    <p>Com­ing next are Dis­ney drama Mulan, open­ing on Fri­day, and su­per­hero movie Won­der Wo­man 1984 on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Peng Hui, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at Tenet dis­trib­u­tor Warner Bros Sin­ga­pore, says that the movie ex­hi­bi­tion busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore needs a Hol­ly­wood crowd-puller at this time.</p>
    <p>He says: “We are very happy to be back in the cin­e­mas with such an en­cour­ag­ing box-of­fice fig­ure for Tenet. What makes it all the more sat­is­fy­ing and mov­ing are the pos­i­tive re­sponses we have re­ceived for the movie and the whole back-to-cin­ema ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
