    <p>PORT MANS­FIELD (Texas) • Hanna, the first hur­ri­cane of the 2020 At­lantic sea­son, has left a trail of de­struc­tion along the Texas coast, down­ing power lines, flood­ing streets and top­pling 18-wheeler trucks as tor­ren­tial rain threat­ened the area.</p>
    <p>Hanna came ashore on Padre Is­land last Satur­day af­ter­noon as a Cat­e­gory 1 hur­ri­cane on the fivestep Saf­fir-Simp­son scale of in­ten­sity, and later made a sec­ond land­fall in Kenedy County, Texas. It swept through a part of the US state hard hit by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. By Sun­day, it had weak­ened to a trop­i­cal de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Pow­er­ful winds from Hanna knocked over heavy ve­hi­cles in­clud­ing at least three 18-wheeler trucks, shut­ting down a 3km stretch of US Route 77 in Sarita, Texas, near the Mex­i­can border.</p>
    <p>In Port Mans­field, 240km south of Padre Is­land, winds flat­tened sug­ar­cane fields and lev­elled trees. Deer roamed the streets, stop­ping to nib­ble downed branches in the yards of homes.</p>
    <p>Down­pours which brought over 30cm of rain flooded road­ways and swelled streams and rivers across south Texas, the Na­tional Weather Ser­vice said. There were no im­me­di­ate re­ports of in­juries.</p>
    <p>“You could hear the wind blow­ing and the rain blow­ing, and (if) you looked out­side, you could see sheets of wa­ter blow­ing down the street,” said Ms Sharon Pecce, 75, a res­i­dent of Port Mans­field, whose house had its roof ripped off last Satur­day night.</p>
    <p>“It’s scary to go through this at my age, a lot could have hap­pened... We could have been killed,” added Ms Pecce who was at a friend’s home with her 70-year-old hus­band when the dam­age oc­curred. “We are lucky we weren’t there.”</p>
    <p>At one point, more than 283,000 homes and busi­nesses were with­out elec­tric­ity. But that fig­ure fell to 98,000 by Sun­day night, ac­cord­ing to Power­outage.us</p>
    <p>The storm was not ex­pected to af­fect off­shore oil and gas pro­duc­tion. En­ergy com­pa­nies have not evac­u­ated work­ers or shut down pro­duc­tion from their Gulf of Mex­ico plat­forms be­cause of Hanna.</p>
    <p>Gover­nor Greg Ab­bott said the Fed­eral Emer­gency Man­age­ment Agency had de­clared the storm a fed­eral emer­gency and would help fund evac­u­a­tion and shel­ter ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The storm was fore­cast to lose steam as it moved across Texas and north-east­ern Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Hawai­ians were brac­ing them­selves for the ar­rival of Hur­ri­cane Dou­glas, which was threat­en­ing to bring sus­tained winds of near 135kmh and tor­ren­tial rain­fall in some ar­eas.</p>
    <p>If Dou­glas, which was down­graded to a Cat­e­gory 1, reaches the is­lands, it would be only the third hur­ri­cane in mod­ern times to do so. The storm was about 100km north­east of Honolulu on Sun­day night, and was ex­pected to pass near the is­lands of Oahu and Kauai later in the night.</p>
    <p>Hur­ri­cane warn­ings were in ef­fect for the coun­ties that in­clude the is­lands of Kauai, Ni­ihau and Oahu, the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said in an ad­vi­sory on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It is rare for hur­ri­canes to hit Hawaii be­cause of the is­lands’ size com­pared with the ex­panse of the Pa­cific Ocean. Other con­di­tions in Hawaii, in­clud­ing lower wa­ter tem­per­a­tures and wind shear, also weaken hur­ri­canes.</p>
    <p>Only two storms since mod­ern record-keep­ing started in 1900 are known to have struck the is­lands:</p>
    <p>In 1992, Hur­ri­cane Iniki hit Kauai as a Cat­e­gory 4 storm, killing six peo­ple and caus­ing about US$3 bil­lion in dam­age. In 1959, Hur­ri­cane Dot struck, caus­ing about US$5.5 mil­lion in dam­age.</p>
    <p>While Dou­glas has weak­ened, the storm was still ex­pected to re­main a hur­ri­cane as it moved through the is­lands. The com­bi­na­tion of high wa­ter lev­els, storm surge and large break­ing waves could raise wa­ter lev­els by close to 1m above nor­mal tides near the storm’s cen­tre, the hur­ri­cane cen­tre warned.</p>
    <p>There can still be hur­ri­cane-force winds in an area with a trop­i­cal storm warn­ing be­cause of the is­lands’ steep ter­rain, in­clud­ing moun­tains, the cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>Fore­cast­ers pre­dicted 75mm to 150mm of rain on the main Hawai­ian is­lands, pos­si­bly con­tribut­ing to flash floods and land­slides.</p>
