    <p>How many of us have stared into our cup­boards and won­dered: “Why did I panic-buy all th­ese dried beans?”</p>
    <p>Many cul­tures around the world have a strong af­fec­tion for the hum­ble pulse and legume. As I think about what I en­joy most about travel, at a time when move­ment is still re­stricted, I re­mem­ber flavour­ful bean dishes rooted in tra­di­tion that also tell a story.</p>
    <p>Al­though I have spent much time trav­el­ling the world and eat­ing pe­tite por­tions crafted by Miche­lin-starred chefs who use tweez­ers to del­i­cately plate their food, I also en­joy search­ing for heartier dishes.</p>
    <p>Cul­tur­ally, bean dishes are more than just a quick and cheap way to feed a large family.</p>
    <p>Each bean dish is also a culi­nary tale of a city, coun­try or re­gion.</p>
    <p>In north-east­ern France, for in­stance, a casse­role dish mar­ries ingredient­s from both its Ger­man and French rulers.</p>
    <p>And who can visit Brazil with­out eat­ing its na­tional dish, fei­joada, a hum­ble plate of food rep­re­sent­ing slav­ery and also the power strug­gles which still ex­ist to­day?</p>
    <p>The dishes I share here not only con­vey the “love” of cooks pre­par­ing good food for loved ones, but they also carry na­tional iden­ti­ties. They are recipes passed down the gen­er­a­tions which cel­e­brate the great, and per­haps not so hum­ble, bean.</p>
