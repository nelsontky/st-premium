    <p>MEM­PHIS • South Korea’s ris­ing star Im Sung-jae will be gun­ning for a strong de­but in the World Golf Cham­pi­onships-FedEx St Jude In­vi­ta­tional, which starts to­day, to reignite his form in time for next month’s lu­cra­tive FedEx Cup Play­offs.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old was among the best-per­form­ing golfers prior to the sus­pen­sion of the PGA Tour due to the Covid-19 pan­demic but has strug­gled for con­sis­tency since com­pe­ti­tion re­sumed last month.</p>
    <p>He won the Honda Clas­sic and fin­ished third at the Arnold Palmer In­vi­ta­tional in March. But aside from a tied-10th fin­ish at last month’s Charles Sch­wab Chal­lenge, Im has dis­ap­pointed with two missed cuts and lowly plac­ings (t-58th, t-53rd and 63rd) in his last five starts.</p>
    <p>He has lost his top spot on the FedEx Cup stand­ings and en­ters this week’s US$10.5 mil­lion (S$14.4 mil­lion) event in third place be­hind leader Justin Thomas and Webb Simp­son.</p>
    <p>Im re­mained a pic­ture of op­ti­mism though.</p>
    <p>“It’s start­ing to get bet­ter,” said last year’s PGA Tour Rookie of the Year.</p>
    <p>“I would, of course, like to win the FedEx Cup but there are so many strong com­peti­tors on Tour. If I were to win, I don’t think I could even put into words what it would mean to me.”</p>
    <p>Com­pa­tri­ots An Byeong-hun and Kang Sung are also com­pet­ing at TPC South­wind in Mem­phis, Ten­nessee.</p>
    <p>The for­mer, who fea­tured in the Pres­i­dents Cup along­side Im last De­cem­ber, has not hit full stride, with a joint-46th his best fin­ish in five starts that in­clude three missed cuts.</p>
    <p>NO ROOM FOR ER­RORS</p>
    <p>I know I’m not there yet... to com­pete week in, week out with the best in the world, you need to step up in ev­ery part of your game. You can’t make stupid mis­takes. ’’</p>
    <p>JAZZ JANEWAT­TANANOND, Thai golfer, on the step up in stan­dards on the PGA Tour.</p>
    <p>The for­mer US Am­a­teur cham­pion started work­ing with putting guru Brad Faxon a cou­ple of months ago to help im­prove his form on the greens.</p>
    <p>An is eye­ing a first ap­pear­ance in the Tour Cham­pi­onship, which is lim­ited to the top 30 on the FedEx Cup points list fol­low­ing the BMW Cham­pi­onship. He is ranked 36th and has set his goal on qual­i­fy­ing for the tour­na­ment as the “ben­e­fits that come with get­ting into it are great”.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s Jazz Janewat­tananond, who has based him­self in Orlando since March, is look­ing for­ward to a de­but ap­pear­ance in Mem­phis. De­spite miss­ing the cut in his last four PGA starts, the 24-yearold is keep­ing his head up.</p>
    <p>“You’re play­ing against the best in the world and you put your­self there. It’s good gaug­ing your­self and know­ing how much more to im­prove and how far I’m away from them,” said Jazz, the reign­ing Asian Tour No. 1.</p>
    <p>“I know I’m not there yet. Peo­ple say, ‘Jazz, you’re so good, you’re No. 1 on the Asian Tour’, but to com­pete week in, week out with the best in the world, you need to step up in ev­ery part of your game. You can’t make stupid mis­takes.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Hideki Mat­suyama, who is in this week’s field, re­mains the only Asian to have won two WGC tour­na­ments. He cap­tured the WGC-FedEx St Jude In­vi­ta­tional when it was played at Fire­stone Coun­try Club in 2017.</p>
