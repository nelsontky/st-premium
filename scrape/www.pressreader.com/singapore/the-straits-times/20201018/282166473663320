    <p>• Cris­tiano Ron­aldo be­come in­volved in a pub­lic row with Italy’s sports min­is­ter on Fri­day, as the pair in­di­rectly ac­cused each other of ly­ing over whether the Por­tu­gal in­ter­na­tional had bro­ken health rules af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Vin­cenzo Spadafora said on Thurs­day that the Ju­ven­tus for­ward might have in­fringed the rules by fly­ing back to Italy from na­tional team duty in Por­tu­gal, af­ter he tested pos­i­tive for the virus ear­lier last week.</p>
    <p>But, in a so­cial me­dia post on Fri­day, Ron­aldo hit back and said he had done ev­ery­thing by the book.</p>
    <p>“A gen­tle­men here i n Italy, whose name I won’t men­tion, said I didn’t obey the pro­to­col – that’s sim­ply a lie,” he said in an In­sta­gram post from his Turin villa, where he is in quar­an­tine and asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>“I fol­lowed all the pro­to­cols and I will con­tinue to fol­low them, my con­science is clear... Ev­ery­thing I did was au­tho­rised.”</p>
    <p>He tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Tues­day while he was with the Por­tu­gal squad and flew back in a pri­vate jet the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>“They said I broke Ital­ian law and this and that... it’s all lies, I did ev­ery­thing prop­erly,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We did ev­ery­thing the right way – leav­ing the (Por­tu­gal) team, in the air am­bu­lance, ar­riv­ing in Turin... I did not have con­tact with any­one.”</p>
    <p>Mr Spadafora later replied in an interview with the Ital­ian news agency Ansa, say­ing: “The fame and skill of cer­tain play­ers does not en­ti­tle them to be ar­ro­gant, dis­re­spect­ful to the in­sti­tu­tions and to lie.</p>
    <p>“On the con­trary, the more well known you are, the more you should feel the re­spon­si­bil­ity of set­ting a good ex­am­ple.”</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus said on Thurs­day that Ron­aldo re­turned to Italy in a “med­i­cal flight au­tho­rised by the com­pe­tent health au­thor­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>The en­tire Juve team were back in iso­la­tion on Wed­nes­day evening af­ter mid­fielder We­ston McKen­nie tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Both he and Ron­aldo must test neg­a­tive be­fore re­join­ing their team­mates. Un­der Uefa rules, a player must pro­vide ev­i­dence that he is no longer sick a week be­fore a Euro­pean match.</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo, who misses Juve’s Serie A match with Cro­tone yes­ter­day and their Cham­pi­ons League opener against Dy­namo Kiev on Tues­day, must test neg­a­tive on Wed­nes­day to play against Barcelona and old foe Lionel Messi a week later.</p>
