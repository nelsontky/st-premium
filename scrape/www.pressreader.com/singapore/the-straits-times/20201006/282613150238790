    <p>The or­ders started rolling in just af­ter mid­night, when SIA@Home went live. And 12 hours later, at 2pm yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines had re­ceived 57 or­ders for its first and business class meals, to be de­liv­ered to homes here.</p>
    <p>More than half – 56 per cent to be pre­cise – of the or­ders were for the first class meals. And of all the or­ders, 72 per cent were for more than just the food. These cus­tomers also opted for ex­tras such as china and glasses.</p>
    <p>Within 30 minutes of the ser­vice go­ing live yes­ter­day, the air­line had re­ceived 10 or­ders, says Ms Betty Wong, the air­line’s divi­sional vi­cepres­i­dent for in-flight ser­vices and de­sign.</p>
    <p>Those who want to or­der the meals can go to www.kris­shop. com/en/store/sia­home.</p>
    <p>SIA@Home is one of three ini­tia­tives the na­tional car­rier has come up with to en­gage cus­tomers dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has dev­as­tated the travel in­dus­try, with pas­sen­gers and planes grounded and the num­ber of flights plung­ing.</p>
    <p>The other two ini­tia­tives are a pop-up restau­rant on Oct 24 and 25 aboard an A380 air­craft parked at Changi Air­port and tours of the air­line’s train­ing fa­cil­i­ties in Novem­ber. Book­ings for the pop-up restau­rant start on Oct 12 and book­ings for tours of the train­ing fa­cil­ity start on Nov 1.</p>
    <p>SIA@Home aims to bring the first and business class ex­pe­ri­ence into homes.</p>
    <p>Prices start at $288 for a business class meal for two and $448 for a first class meal for two.</p>
    <p>These pack­ages in­clude wine and amenity kits – from French lux­ury brand Lalique for the first class pack­ages and Pen­haligon’s for the business class ones. The kits from Bri­tish per­fume house Pen­haligon’s have not been launched on flights, so cus­tomers who or­der the business class meals will be the first to get them, says Ms Wong.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers can opt to add cham­pagne and other ex­tras to their menus, and prices top out at $388 for the top business class pack­age, which in­cludes a 14-piece set of table­ware by Narumi, glasses, amenity kits, slip­pers, socks and eye­shades.</p>
    <p>The first class all-in­clu­sive pack­age is priced at $888 and in­cludes a bot­tle of cham­pagne, a bot­tle of red or white bur­gundy wine, a 12-piece set of Wedg­wood bone china table­ware, a six-piece set of Lalique crys­tal glasses, three amenity kits, Lalique sleep suits, and slip­pers, socks and eye­shades.</p>
    <p>The meals – the very ones served aboard SIA flights – were de­signed by chefs from the air­line’s In­ter­na­tional Culi­nary Panel – Ge­orges Blanc of the three-Miche­lin-starred Restau­rant Ge­orges Blanc in France; Matt Mo­ran of Aria in Aus­tralia; Yoshi­hiro Mu­rata of three-Miche­lin-starred Kikunoi in Ja­pan; and San­jeev Kapoor, chef, tele­vi­sion host and cook­book au­thor from In­dia.</p>
    <p>“This is not a home de­liv­ery ser­vice,” says Ms Wong at a pre­view for the me­dia yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This is about an ex­pe­ri­ence at home, with the wines, sa­tay and gar­lic bread that peo­ple miss.”</p>
    <p>To that end, the air­line is try­ing to make the or­der­ing and re­ceiv­ing ex­pe­ri­ence as seam­less as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>A team of cabin crew concierges guides cus­tomers through their choices. Once the or­der is con­firmed, cus­tomers are sent an email con­tain­ing a wel­come mes­sage, a video from the chef whose meal they have cho­sen, a video from the som­me­lier who had picked the wines and re­heat­ing and plat­ing in­struc­tions, among other things.</p>
    <p>The air­line has also cu­rated four playlists which cus­tomers can lis­ten to while they have their meals.</p>
    <p>In­ci­den­tally, the food is de­liv­ered the way they would be on planes – on foil trays, says Mr Antony McNeil, the air­line’s food and bev­er­age di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Air­lines some­times sea­son their food more strongly to com­pen­sate for how the pressurise­d cab­ins and high al­ti­tude blunt peo­ple’s senses of taste and smell, but he says that new air­craft have more mois­ture in the air – 16 to 18 per cent hu­mid­ity, com­pared with 12 per cent for older air­craft – so there was no need to ad­just the sea­son­ing for the food to be con­sumed on terra firma.</p>
    <p>“The mois­ture con­tent in the cab­ins is higher and si­nuses don’t dry up as much,” he says.</p>
