    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The pan­demicde­layed Os­cars are still seven months away, but Frances McDor­mand’s No­mad­land ce­mented its early fron­trun­ner sta­tus by bag­ging the Toronto film fes­ti­val’s top prize on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The movie about a community of el­derly, no­madic ide­al­ists who roam across the United States in worn-out vans had al­ready won Venice’s Golden Lion ear­lier this month for star-and-pro­ducer McDor­mand and China-born di­rec­tor Chloe Zhao.</p>
    <p>It has now added the Peo­ple’s Choice Award voted for by au­di­ences in Toronto – North Amer­ica’s biggest film fes­ti­val – which is con­sid­ered a use­ful early Os­cars bell­wether.</p>
    <p>The film – an ode to Amer­i­can wan­der­lust and the highs and lows of the open road – has stood out in a sparse year so far, with many top pro­duc­tions halted and the­atri­cal re­leases de­layed due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Academy Awards have been pushed back two months to</p>
    <p>April 25, partly to al­low more movies a chance to com­pete.</p>
    <p>No­mad­land beat Toronto’s first run­ner-up One Night In Miami, an adap­ta­tion by Watch­men (2019) ac­tress Regina King of a play imag­in­ing a heated 1964 mo­tel room con­ver­sa­tion in­volv­ing civil rights leader Mal­colm X, box­ing le­gend Muham­mad Ali, singer and ac­tivist Sam Cooke and Na­tional Foot­ball League star Jim Brown.</p>
    <p>The Toronto Peo­ple’s Choice Award, de­ter­mined en­tirely by the votes of fes­ti­val at­ten­dees, has a fairly strong his­tory of pre­dict­ing Os­cars suc­cess.</p>
    <p>The last eight win­ners were all nom­i­nated for Best Pic­ture at the Academy Awards, with two of those win­ning the Os­car, in­clud­ing last year’s sur­prise vic­tor Green Book.</p>
    <p>12 Years A Slave (2013), The King’s Speech (2010) and Slum­dog Mil­lion­aire (2008) all be­gan their jour­neys to Os­car glory with the Toronto prize.</p>
    <p>No­mad­land earned rave re­views from crit­ics af­ter its world pre­miere in Venice, which was fol­lowed hours later by drive-in screen­ings in Toronto and South­ern Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter called it “a unique por­trait of out­sider ex­is­tence”, while Va­ri­ety termed it a “ten­der ode to Amer­i­can in­de­pen­dence”.</p>
    <p>No­mad­land comes from the same stu­dio – Search­light – as last year’s Toronto win­ner Jojo Rab­bit. The Nazi satire went on to win Best Adapted Screen­play at the Os­cars, but was beaten to the top prize by South Korean jug­ger­naut Par­a­site.</p>
    <p>The Toronto In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val took place mainly on­line this year, along with a hand­ful of drive-in and lim­ited-ca­pac­ity in­door screen­ings.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual gala last week, it handed ca­reer achieve­ment awards to fast-ris­ing Zhao – who will over­see next year’s Mar­vel su­per­hero epic Eter­nals – as well as ac­tors An­thony Hop­kins and Kate Winslet.</p>
