    <p>When Ms Jayina Chan, 32, started wean­ing her daugh­ter, Anya Arissa, now four, she could not find much in­for­ma­tion on the nu­tri­tional con­tent of baby food.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that nu­tri­tion plays an im­por­tant role, es­pe­cially since the first 1,000 days of a baby’s life are re­ally im­por­tant. This is when he or she grows ex­po­nen­tially in many as­pects,” she says.</p>
    <p>She started ex­per­i­ment­ing with new in­gre­di­ents while pre­par­ing Anya’s food and was sur­prised when other moth­ers and care­givers pep­pered her with ques­tions on In­sta­gram. Many of them were fa­mil­iar only with mak­ing por­ridge and sim­ple Asian dishes.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised that there’s a gap in the mar­ket for baby food, es­pe­cially for the halal mar­ket,” says Ms Chan, a for­mer air­line cabin crew.</p>
    <p>In 2017, she launched Anya Meals, test­ing the mar­ket by cap­ping her ca­pac­ity at 20 cus­tomers to main­tain qual­ity stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Her menu of stews, stocks and por­ridges would not look out of place in a hip­ster cafe, ex­cept that ev­ery­thing is freshly made and blended, frozen im­me­di­ately and de­liv­ered to her cus­tomers’ doorsteps.</p>
    <p>The beef and spinach con­gee ($34.80 for 10 tubs, each weigh­ing about 113g), for in­stance, is made with gluten-free or­ganic brown rice, grass-fed beef and or­ganic spinach. Her lentil mil­let stew ($32.80 for 10 tubs) is a blend of or­ganic hulled mil­let and or­ganic red lentils, car­rots and Hol­land pota­toes.</p>
    <p>All the prod­ucts are free of salt, monosodium glu­ta­mate, preser­va­tives, colour­ing and ad­di­tives, and no sugar is added. They also con­tain no dairy, eggs, nuts, crus­taceans or soya.</p>
    <p>By the end of that year, de­mand had out­stripped the ca­pac­ity of her home-based busi­ness, so her hus­band, Mr Ai­man Ma­jid, 36, quit his job in the bunker­ing in­dus­try to help.</p>
    <p>To­day, Anya Meals op­er­ates from a li­censed kitchen at East Vil­lage Mall, with one per­ma­nent staff mem­ber, a cou­ple of part-timers and a de­liv­ery team.</p>
    <p>With close to 200 cus­tomers buy­ing meals on a weekly pre-or­der ba­sis, the busi­ness is grow­ing so fast that Ms Chan is in the midst of leas­ing an­other unit for stor­age.</p>
    <p>Mr Ai­man han­dles the food prepa­ra­tion while his wife op­er­ates from home, li­ais­ing with sup­pli­ers and cus­tomers, as well as tak­ing care of son Adam, who is 1½. They do not have a maid.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker boosted busi­ness by four- to five­fold, Ms Chan re­calls, as fam­i­lies stayed home and par­ents started stock­ing up on es­sen­tials.</p>
    <p>She is mulling over ex­pan­sion plans, such as work­ing with an on­line gro­cer on a con­sign­ment ba­sis and even go­ing re­gional, but wants to make sure qual­ity is not com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive feed­back on her food keeps her go­ing. “Par­ents said the meals were ac­cepted well by their ba­bies, our stock helped flavour their meals and their ba­bies were eat­ing and gain­ing weight. It’s a good thing to hear.”</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, while she had fun ex­per­i­ment­ing with wean­ing foods for Anya, her son proved to be a picky eater and did not like her recipes at first. But she re­mained un­fazed, given her ear­lier ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“I learnt that exposure is key, so I kept try­ing all these things with Adam and, thank­fully, he’s eat­ing a lot more now. It took a while, but we’re here,” she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that nu­tri­tion plays an im­por­tant role, es­pe­cially since the first 1,000 days of a baby’s life are re­ally im­por­tant. This is when he or she grows ex­po­nen­tially in many as­pects.</p>
