    <p>MR CHANDA VENKATESH, MAN­AG­ING DI­REC­TOR OF CAPSGOLD, A BUL­LION MER­CHANT IN HY­DER­ABAD, ON GOLD LOS­ING ITS SHINE AMID FLUCTUATIN­G PRICES</p>
    <p>MUM­BAI/BEN­GALURU • Phys­i­cal gold deal­ers in In­dia are of­fer­ing the high­est dis­counts in more than 11/ months, as buy­ers stayed away</p>
    <p>2 even as more bul­lion flowed in from the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, gold fu­tures in In­dia, tra­di­tion­ally the world’s sec­ond­biggest gold con­sumer af­ter China, were trad­ing at around 51,800 ru­pees per 10g, hav­ing surged to a record high of 56,191 ru­pees ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“A sig­nif­i­cant amount of gold was im­ported from Dubai last week and Cus­toms cleared that this week. But de­mand is not there be­cause of volatile prices,” Mr Chanda Venkatesh, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of CapsGold, a bul­lion mer­chant in the city of Hy­der­abad, said last week.</p>
    <p>Dis­counts of up to US$20 (S$27) an ounce were of­fered against of­fi­cial do­mes­tic prices – in­clud­ing 12.5 per cent im­port and 3 per cent sales levies – ver­sus the US$2 pre­mi­ums two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­mained in the grip of the coro­n­avirus, with the third­high­est num­ber of cases glob­ally.</p>
    <p>De­mand suf­fered in China as well, where dis­counts eased slightly to US$70-US$80, from record US$75-US$100 lev­els two weeks ago, ver­sus in­ter­na­tional bench­mark spot prices, which traded in a volatile US$1,911 to US$2,014.97 an ounce range.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic sit­u­a­tion is un­likely to go away this year, so don’t ex­pect much change,” said Mr Peter Fung, head of deal­ing at Wing Fung Pre­cious Met­als.</p>
    <p>Gold has been sold at dis­counts in China since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>But it has re­port­edly be­come more dif­fi­cult to buy gold scrap, said Mr Sam­son Li, a Hong Kong­based an­a­lyst at Refini­tiv GFMS.</p>
    <p>The price dif­fer­ence be­tween China and other mar­kets is too huge and re­tail­ers have started to hoard gold ma­te­ri­als, he added.</p>
    <p>Pre­mi­ums of US$1 to US$1.50 were charged in Singapore, with some us­ing price dips to buy bul­lion. Said Mr Brian Lan of Singapore dealer GoldSil­ver: “We still see many more clients look­ing at sil­ver.”</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, gold was sold at 50 US cent pre­mi­ums. “Our sil­ver in­gots are all sold out again,” a trader at Tokyo-based re­tailer Tokuriki Hon­ten said.</p>

Phys&#xAD;i&#xAD;cal gold deal&#xAD;ers in the coun&#xAD;try are of&#xAD;fer&#xAD;ing the high&#xAD;est dis&#xAD;counts in more than 1&#xBD; months, as buy&#xAD;ers stayed away even as more bul&#xAD;lion flowed in from the United Arab Emi&#xAD;rates.</p>
