    <p>In the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, Sin­ga­pore­ans in the mid­dle of the in­come spec­trum for cit­i­zens earn less than per­ma­nent res­i­dents and for­eign­ers at the same point in their in­come spec­trums.</p>
    <p>Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore board mem­ber Ong Ye Kung told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day that for Sin­ga­pore­ans, the me­dian wage band is $6,000 to $8,000 a month, while for PRs and for­eign­ers, it is $8,000 to $10,000.</p>
    <p>In se­nior level po­si­tions, about half of Sin­ga­pore­ans and half of for­eign­ers earn above $30,000 a month, while al­most two-thirds of PRs do so, he said, adding that these sets of data are “as one would expect”.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions of­ten bring in higher-earn­ing for­eign­ers to per­form spe­cialised, or re­gional and global roles.</p>
    <p>Also, Sin­ga­pore’s rules con­strain the in­flow of for­eign­ers at the lower end, said Mr Ong, who is the Trans­port Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>This means a larger share of for­eign­ers tend to be earn­ing higher wages and con­se­quently, the me­dian would be at a higher level too.</p>
    <p>Also, for­eign­ers with im­pres­sive profiles and track records in Sin­ga­pore would be ex­pected to be more suc­cess­ful in at­tain­ing PR sta­tus.</p>
    <p>“In other words, this data shows out­comes which re­flect the fact that we reg­u­late the in­flow of for­eign­ers, and ap­ply se­lec­tive cri­te­ria in grant­ing PR to those who were pre­vi­ously for­eign PMEs (pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives),” he said.</p>
    <p>“If there was no reg­u­la­tion to con­trol the in­flow of Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers, and no cri­te­ria and con­di­tions for PRs based on their track records, these earn­ing dif­fer­en­tials will nat­u­rally nar­row or dis­ap­pear.”</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC), dur­ing ques­tion-and-an­swer time, on the break­down of the monthly salary for Sin­ga­pore­ans, PRs and for­eign­ers in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor at the 25th, 50th and 75th per­centiles.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said such a break­down would not be mean­ing­ful. The rea­son is a for­eigner and a Sin­ga­porean at the same per­centile of their re­spec­tive wage spec­trums could be do­ing very dif­fer­ent jobs and thus earn­ing dif­fer­ent salaries.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, when he ad­dressed con­cerns about whether there are enough op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, he said in the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress that the ab­so­lute num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans in se­nior roles had grown from 1,700 to 2,600 from 2014 to last year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, re­ply­ing to Mr Chua who had asked about ef­forts to help Sin­ga­porean mid­dle man­agers move up into se­nior man­age­ment roles, Mr Ong said the ap­proach should be to be open to the world and grow as a global fi­nan­cial cen­tre, while in­vest­ing in de­vel­op­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and work­ing with fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to do so.</p>
    <p>“If we keep say­ing let’s just be a lake, shut our­selves out from the la­goon, and the la­goon shut it­self out from the sea, we will al­ways be a small pond.”</p>
    <p>He added: “You can de­velop your mid­dle man­age­ment to take up se­nior po­si­tions but your mar­ket will be small.”</p>
