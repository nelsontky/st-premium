    <p>She was only 12 years old when her step­fa­ther first sex­u­ally abused her, with the 41-year-old go­ing on to as­sault the girl on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions in 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <p>He took ad­van­tage of her while they were alone at home or when the rest of the fam­ily were asleep, grow­ing more in­tru­sive with each act as he pro­gressed from mo­lesta­tion to sex­u­ally pen­e­trat­ing her with his hand.</p>
    <p>The abuse ended only when he was ar­rested, af­ter the girl told a school coun­sel­lor.</p>
    <p>The man was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to 20 years’ jail and 24 strokes of the cane af­ter he pleaded guilty to two charges of sex­ual as­sault in­volv­ing pen­e­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Three other counts of out­rag­ing the girl’s mod­esty and two other charges of sex­ual as­sault were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing by Jus­tice Dedar Singh Gill.</p>
    <p>The girl and the man can­not be iden­ti­fied due to a gag or­der to pro­tect her iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that the girl was found to have mild in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity, dys­lexia and low cog­ni­tive abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>At the time of the of­fences, the man was liv­ing in a flat with the girl, her bi­o­log­i­cal mother, grand­mother and younger sis­ter, as well as a do­mes­tic helper and a fe­male ten­ant.</p>
    <p>He had mar­ried the girl’s mother in 2012.</p>
    <p>The man started sex­u­ally as­sault­ing his step­daugh­ter some time in July or Au­gust 2017.</p>
    <p>He con­tin­ued to abuse the girl over the next 15 months, com­mit­ting the of­fences in the master bed­room with the door shut.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded sex­u­ally pen­e­trat­ing the girl with his hand in Oc­to­ber 2017 and in Novem­ber 2018, when she tried to stop the man.</p>
    <p>The girl did not con­fide in her fam­ily, afraid of how her mother and grand­mother would re­spond and wor­ried she may be dis­be­lieved. She also did not want to fur­ther bur­den her mother, who had health is­sues.</p>
    <p>But she even­tu­ally told her school coun­sel­lor on Nov 2, 2018 that the man “was do­ing things to her”, and filed a po­lice re­port. The man was ar­rested on the same day.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing the court to sen­tence the man to at least 20 years’ jail and 24 strokes of the cane, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Sruthi Bop­pana and Grace Teo noted that he had abused the girl within the sanc­tity of the fam­ily home, where she was en­ti­tled to feel safe and seek refuge.</p>
    <p>In mit­i­ga­tion, de­fence l awyer Jonathan Wong said that his client wanted to rec­on­cile with his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The man’s jail term has been back­dated to Nov 3, 2018, when he was first re­manded.</p>
    <p>For each of­fence of sex­ual as­sault in­volv­ing pen­e­tra­tion, the man could have been jailed for be­tween eight and 20 years and pun­ished with at least 12 strokes of the cane.</p>
