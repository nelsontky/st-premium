    <p>Thai law­mak­ers have re­jected mak­ing a con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment to re­duce the pow­ers of the monar­chy. They agreed to set up a com­mit­tee to write a new char­ter, but will skip any re­view of chap­ters gov­ern­ing the monar­chy’s role.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s Par­lia­ment re­jected a push by pro-democ­racy groups for a Con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment to re­duce the pow­ers of the na­tion’s monar­chy, po­ten­tially es­ca­lat­ing months-long anti-gov­ern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>The law­mak­ers in­stead voted for set­ting up a char­ter rewrit­ing com­mit­tee that will skip any re­view of chap­ters gov­ern­ing the monar­chy, the most pow­er­ful in­sti­tu­tion in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>The roadmap for amend­ment pro­posed by a rights group, which the pro­test­ers sup­port, failed to se­cure enough sup­port from the law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>With the Par­lia­ment turn­ing down the de­mand for monar­chy re­form, protest groups have vowed to stage mass gath­er­ings un­til all of their de­mands are met, which also in­clude the res­ig­na­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha and a rewrit­ing of the char­ter to make it more demo­cratic.</p>
    <p>The Par­lia­ment de­ci­sion came as thou­sands of anti-gov­ern­ment ac­tivists held a rally for a se­cond straight day in the cap­i­tal, after the most vi­o­lent protest in years a day ear­lier left more than 50 peo­ple in­jured. They ral­lied to the po­lice head­quar­ters in cen­tral Bangkok yes­ter­day to protest against the use of wa­ter can­nons and tear­gas on demon­stra­tors.</p>
    <p>“The vote shows that most mem­bers of Par­lia­ment chose to up­hold the power of feu­dal dic­ta­tor­ship and ig­nore the de­mands of the peo­ple,” Free Youth, one of the protest groups, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“It can be pre­dicted that the new Con­sti­tu­tion to be drawn up won’t re­flect the will of the peo­ple be­cause monar­chy re­form won’t be part of the dis­cus­sion by the rewrit­ing com­mit­tee.”</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s cur­rent char­ter has been the point of con­tention since its in­cep­tion after Mr Prayut, a for­mer army chief, took power in a 2014 coup.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers and crit­ics viewed it</p>
    <p>as in­stru­men­tal in help­ing the roy­al­ist es­tab­lish­ment re­tain its grip on power with Mr Prayut re­turn­ing as the leader after last year’s elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The char­ter al­lows the mil­i­taryap­pointed Se­nate, whose pow­ers</p>
    <p>pro­test­ers want scrapped, to vote for the premier.</p>
    <p>Thai pro­test­ers have bro­ken long-held ta­boos about pub­licly crit­i­cis­ing the royal fam­ily and ques­tion­ing laws that sti­fle dis­cus­sion of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Free Youth has said the char­ter should be amended to “bring the monar­chy un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion”.</p>
    <p>The Par­lia­ment’s char­ter amend­ments likely will not ad­dress all of the de­mands from the pro­test­ers, ac­cord­ing to po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>The vote yes­ter­day is the first of the three planned that could pave a way to amend the char­ter, a process that is ex­pected to take about a year or longer.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, a rally near Par­lia­ment turned vi­o­lent after the po­lice fired wa­ter can­nons mixed with ir­ri­tants to dis­perse the crowd and some pro-gov­ern­ment sup­port­ers clashed with the pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>The clashes point to grow­ing po­lit­i­cal un­rest with pro-es­tab­lish­ment groups also stag­ing reg­u­lar demon­stra­tions. At least six peo­ple were in­jured from gun shots dur­ing Tues­day’s protest, ac­cord­ing to emer­gency med­i­cal ser­vices, but po­lice de­nied us­ing rub­ber bul­lets or live am­mu­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut, who has re­peat­edly re­jected calls to quit, said yes­ter­day he has asked se­cu­rity of­fi­cials to en­sure the safety of all sides dur­ing the protests, and urged ac­tivists to re­spect the law and avoid vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Bangkok po­lice deputy com­mis­sioner Piya Tavichai said of­fi­cers are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the shoot­ings, which hap­pened about 300m from the main protest zone.</p>
    <p>He said one roy­al­ist sup­porter was shot in the hip and a prodemoc­racy pro­tester in the leg.</p>
    <p>“The rest of shoot­ing vic­tims are still un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion, but the fact was both sides were shot and wounded,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Thai Hu­man Rights Lawyers As­so­ci­a­tion slammed po­lice tac­tics, say­ing they were “not in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional pro­ce­dure to dis­perse demon­stra­tions”.</p>
