    <p>•</p>
    <p>BER­LIN Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel called on Ger­mans to re­main dis­ci­plined in the fight against Covid-19, as the coun­try grap­ples with a re­newed rise in cases and fa­tal­i­ties from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>In her last New Year ad­dress, the Ger­man leader – who will step down af­ter elec­tions in Septem­ber – said per­se­ver­ance would be needed dur­ing a harsh win­ter as a vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign is ramped up. Amid safety con­cerns over the vac­cine, she said she would get the shot as soon as it is her turn.</p>
    <p>“These days and weeks – there is noth­ing to su­gar-coat – are dif­fi­cult times for our coun­try,” Dr Merkel said. “And so it will con­tinue to be for quite a while.”</p>
    <p>Ger­many is strug­gling to con­tain the spread of Covid-19, like many of its Euro­pean neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions rose to a record of 49,044 yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to data from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity. The num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties jumped by another 963, one day af­ter deaths ex­ceeded 1,000 for the first time. In­ten­sive care units threaten to be­come over­loaded and con­ta­gion rates are more than dou­ble gov­ern­ment tar­gets.</p>
    <p>It is a sim­i­lar story in other Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Spain on Wed­nes­day said 9,860 new coro­n­avirus cases were di­ag­nosed, the high­est daily num­ber since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Covid-19 deaths in the coun­try sur­passed 50,000.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel’s com­ments in­di­cate that re­stric­tions to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus will con­tinue beyond Jan 10, when most curbs are set to ex­pire.</p>
    <p>The Chan­cel­lor and the premiers of Ger­many’s 16 states want to ex­tend the hard lock­down – which keeps non-es­sen­tial stores, gyms and restau­rants shut – by another two or three weeks at a meet­ing next week, the Bild news­pa­per re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Even though vac­cines will grad­u­ally be made avail­able across the pop­u­la­tion, “the tasks ahead re­main gi­gan­tic”, Dr Merkel said, urg­ing Ger­mans to show the same sol­i­dar­ity and dis­ci­pline in the new year that have brought them through the pan­demic so far.</p>
    <p>The som­bre tone be­lies a suc­cess­ful close to Ger­many’s Euro­pean Union pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>At the tail end of the six-month term, Dr Merkel helped se­cure back­ing for the bloc’s land­mark spend­ing and re­cov­ery pack­age, fi­nalised a post-Brexit trade deal with Bri­tain and com­pleted an in­vest­ment pact with China.</p>
    <p>Her fi­nal full year in of­fice was prob­a­bly her tough­est.</p>
    <p>“Never in the last 15 years have any of us felt the out­go­ing year to be so weary,” she said.</p>
