    <p>JAKARTA • Two In­done­sian mil­i­tants linked to a church blast in the Philip­pines in 2019 have been shot dead by po­lice, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day, as of­fi­cers ar­rested scores of rad­i­cals who sup­port the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) ter­ror group.</p>
    <p>The shoot­ings came as In­done­sia’s counter-ter­ror­ism squad, Den­sus 88, raided a hide­out of ex­trem­ist group Ja­maah An­sharut Daulah (JAD) in Su­lawesi’s Makas­sar city, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Two sus­pects were gunned down when they “re­sisted ar­rest” and at­tacked of­fi­cers, po­lice said, adding that a third sus­pect suf­fered gun­shot in­juries and was be­ing treated in hos­pi­tal. An­other 17 mil­i­tants were de­tained.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said later that the two dead sus­pects were in­volved in fi­nanc­ing the Philip­pines’ worst ter­ror at­tack in years, which killed 21 and in­jured scores more in 2019.</p>
    <p>“The two were in­volved in trans­fer­ring money to the bombers of the church in Jolo, Philip­pines,” na­tional po­lice spokesman Ah­mad Ra­mad­han told re­porters, with­out elab­o­rat­ing.</p>
    <p>In early 2019, two explosions ripped through a Catholic church on the Philip­pines’ Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity is­land of Jolo, killing wor­ship­pers at Sun­day mass and se­cu­rity forces – rais­ing fears about grow­ing links be­tween mil­i­tants in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>ISIS had claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity for the cathe­dral blast, say­ing two sui­cide bombers det­o­nated ex­plo­sive belts.</p>
    <p>The pair were later iden­ti­fied as an In­done­sian mil­i­tant and his wife.</p>
    <p>The Jolo at­tack was car­ried out days af­ter vot­ers ap­proved ex­pand­ing Mus­lim self-rule in the south aimed at end­ing a decades-old re­bel­lion for in­de­pen­dence or au­ton­omy for the size­able Is­lamic mi­nor­ity of the mainly Catholic Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said the two men shot dead were mem­bers of the JAD, a lo­cal ter­ror net­work which has pledged al­le­giance to ISIS and its vi­o­lent ide­ol­ogy. Mem­bers of JAD staged a wave of sui­cide bomb­ings at churches in In­done­sia’s sec­ond­biggest city Surabaya in 2018, killing a dozen con­gre­gants.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties are still on the hunt for a group of ter­ror­ists who killed four Chris­tians in Novem­ber in Cen­tral Su­lawesi prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The ter­ror­ist group of 11 men from the ex­trem­ist Eastern In­done­sia Mu­jahideen (MIT) had also pledged al­le­giance to ISIS.</p>
    <p>MIT is led by Ali Kalora. He took over the lead­er­ship from San­toso, who was once In­done­sia’s most­wanted ter­ror­ist. San­toso was killed in July 2016 af­ter a mas­sive man­hunt.</p>
