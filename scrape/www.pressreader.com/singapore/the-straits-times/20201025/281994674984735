    <p>BAKU • New clashes broke out be­tween Azer­bai­jan and eth­nic Ar­me­nian forces over NagornoKar­abakh a day af­ter talks were held in Wash­ing­ton to try to end the dead­li­est fight­ing in the en­clave in more than a quar­ter of a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan’s de­fence min­istry re­ported fight­ing i n and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a moun­tain­ous part of Azer­bai­jan pop­u­lated and con­trolled by eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans.</p>
    <p>It said the ar­eas of Lachin and Gubadli had come un­der rocket and ar­tillery fire from in­side Ar­me­nian ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>In Nagorno-Karabakh, lo­cal of­fi­cials ac­cused Azer­bai­jan’s forces of fir­ing Smerch mis­siles into res­i­den­tial build­ings in Stepanaker­t, the largest city in the re­gion, which Baku de­nied.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo had met separately with the for­eign min­is­ters of Azer­bai­jan and Ar­me­nia on Fri­day in a new at­tempt to end nearly a month of blood­shed that Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir</p>
    <p>Putin said may have killed 5,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The col­lapse of two Rus­sia-bro­kered cease­fires had al­ready dimmed the prospect of a quick end to fight­ing that broke out on Sept 27 over Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan said a 13-year-old Rus­sian boy died yes­ter­day af­ter be­ing wounded in a rocket at­tack on the city of Ganja on Oct 17.</p>
    <p>The de­fence au­thor­i­ties of Nagorno-Karabakh said the to­tal num­ber of Ar­me­ni­ans killed in the weeks of fight­ing had risen by 36 to 963, the Rus­sian news agency In­ter­fax re­ported.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan says 65 Az­eri civil­ians have been killed and 298 wounded, but has not dis­closed its mil­i­tary ca­su­al­ties. Az­eri forces say they have made ter­ri­to­rial gains, in­clud­ing full con­trol over the bor­der with Iran, which Ar­me­nia de­nies.</p>
    <p>Nagorno-Karabakh’s eth­nic Ar­me­nian ad­min­is­tra­tion says its forces have re­pulsed at­tacks.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan Pres­i­dent Il­ham</p>
    <p>Aliyev told French news­pa­per Le Fi­garo that Baku was ready to sit down for ne­go­ti­a­tions but blamed Ar­me­nia’s ac­tions for the con­tin­ued hos­til­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We are ready to stop even to­day,” Mr Aliyev was quoted as say­ing. “But, un­for­tu­nately, Ar­me­nia grossly vi­o­lated the cease­fire... If they don’t stop, we will go to the end with the aim of lib­er­at­ing all the oc­cu­pied ter­ri­to­ries.”</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia’s for­eign min­istry said Azer­bai­jan’s ag­gres­sion posed an ex­is­ten­tial threat to the se­cu­rity of the re­gion.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said “good progress” was be­ing made on the is­sue, but did not elab­o­rate and de­clined to say if he had spo­ken with the lead­ers of ei­ther coun­try.</p>
    <p>Asked by re­porters how his talks with Mr Pom­peo went, Ar­me­nian For­eign Min­is­ter Zohrab Mnat­sakanyan said “very good” as he ex­ited the US State Depart­ment, and added that work on a cease­fire would con­tinue.</p>
    <p>World pow­ers want to pre­vent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong sup­port for Azer­bai­jan, and Rus­sia, which has a de­fence pact with Ar­me­nia.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ences over the con­flict have fur­ther strained re­la­tions be­tween Ankara and its Nato al­lies, with Mr Pom­peo ac­cus­ing Turkey of fu­elling the con­flict by arm­ing the Az­eri side. Ankara de­nies it has in­flamed the con­flict.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo had said ahead of Fri­day’s talks that he hoped the “right path for­ward” could be found.</p>
    <p>But Ar­me­nian Prime Min­is­ter Nikol Pashinyan said he saw no diplo­matic res­o­lu­tion of the con­flict at this stage, and Mr Aliyev has de­scribed the prospects of a peace set­tle­ment as “very remote”.</p>
    <p>About 30,000 peo­ple were killed in a 1991-94 war over NagornoKar­abakh. Ar­me­ni­ans re­gard the en­clave as part of their his­toric home­land; Az­eris con­sider it il­le­gally oc­cu­pied land that must be re­turned to their con­trol.</p>
    <p>The de­fence au­thor­i­ties of Nagorno-Karabakh said the to­tal num­ber of Ar­me­ni­ans killed in the weeks of fight­ing had risen by 36 to 963.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan says 65 Az­eri civil­ians have been killed and 298 wounded, but has not dis­closed its mil­i­tary ca­su­al­ties.</p>
