    <p>48,822... 48,825... 48,831...</p>
    <p>Some­times, when I am feel­ing es­pe­cially over­whelmed, I just pause and watch the lit­tle un­read e-mails counter tick up.</p>
    <p>Not to brag, but to my best es­ti­mate, my e-mails are cur­rently pil­ing up in my in­box at a rate of two to three a minute.</p>
    <p>I do not pre­tend for a mo­ment that I am in pos­ses­sion of the world’s busiest e-mail in­box – I am sure that even within my own de­part­ment there are peo­ple re­ceiv­ing way more than this – but the cur­rent rate al­ready ex­ceeds how fast I can clear them.</p>
    <p>That means I would set aside time each morn­ing for the Sisyphean task of dig­ging my­self out of an un­read e-mail hole and, with­out fail, I would emerge each time in a hole deeper than the one I be­gan with.</p>
    <p>More than once, I have toyed with the nu­clear op­tion: “se­lect all” and then “mark as read”. But most days, I am re­signed to the numbers just grow­ing.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t al­ways like this. There was a time, and it feels like not so long ago, when I was ac­tu­ally ex­cited to re­ceive e-mails and would deal with each one the mo­ment I got it.</p>
    <p>The lit­tle red badge that would pop up on the iPhone mail icon was anath­ema. It had to be ban­ished the mo­ment I saw it. Now, I do not bat an eye at the per­ma­nent un­read no­ti­fi­ca­tion dot over my Gmail icon.</p>
    <p>Over the years, so many dif­fer­ent at­tack­ers have laid siege to e-mail, stab­bing and beating it re­peat­edly to the point that it is now re­duced to a joy­less, prac­ti­cally life­less medium.</p>
    <p>If e-mail isn’t al­ready dead, it now sure feels like it is dy­ing.</p>
    <p>E-mail’s de­cline feels slow, but also ap­pears to have hap­pened sud­denly. It feels like not so long ago, I was hap­pily e-mail­ing friends and fam­ily, en­joy­ing the nov­elty of hav­ing mis­sives re­ceived in­stantly wher­ever in the world I was.</p>
    <p>E-mail formed the cen­tral core of my com­mu­ni­ca­tions with my fam­ily in Malaysia while I was in univer­sity in Aus­tralia. It was the first thing my par­ents re­ally learnt how to do on­line. E-mail­ing their son was their gate­way to the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>To­day, I no longer send or re­ceive any e-mails about per­sonal mat­ters. In­stant mes­sag­ing and so­cial me­dia apps like What­sApp, Tele­gram and Face­book have com­pletely taken over all per­sonal com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>E-mail is now con­sid­ered too slow and too fussy for such com­mu­ni­ca­tion. It has be­come ill-suited to the kind of things we want to share with one an­other.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a par­tic­u­larly good meal? Tak­ing a photo, then fir­ing up an e-mail app, typ­ing in your re­cip­i­ent’s ad­dress, a sub­ject, a greet­ing, a short mes­sage and sign-off, then at­tach­ing a photo, would most likely prompt the re­cip­i­ent to in­quire of your men­tal well-be­ing – prob­a­bly via a plat­form other than e-mail.</p>
    <p>So no, per­sonal mat­ters no longer be­long on e-mail.</p>
    <p>That means a big chunk of the fun that used to be on e-mail is gone.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing left is, in­vari­ably, ei­ther some­thing to be ig­nored or some­thing that needs to be dealt with. In other words, e-mail is now all work, ad­ver­tis­ing, bills and spam.</p>
    <p>In a way, there is some karmic jus­tice here.</p>
    <p>After all, e-mail had, dur­ing its as­cent, sucked all the joy out of snail mail. Sud­denly, peo­ple stopped send­ing per­sonal let­ters and pen pals mi­grated on­line.</p>
    <p>The pri­mary oc­cu­pants of my snail mail let­ter­box these days are bank state­ments, lit­tle fliers in­form­ing me how much apart­ments in my neigh­bour­hood re­cently sold for, and, oc­ca­sion­ally, a small lizard I have named Mau­rice.</p>
    <p>To be fair, snail mail is not com­pletely dire.</p>
    <p>Once a year, I still re­ceive non-vir­tual Christ­mas cards with per­sonal notes – which are al­ways a joy – and the post­man also some­times leaves small items I have or­dered on­line in the mail­box.</p>
    <p>There is no such respite in e-mail. Ev­ery e-mail is a drag.</p>
    <p>Some do not ac­tu­ally have any­thing to do with me but clut­ter up my in­box any­way. I am ac­tu­ally re­ceiv­ing these be­cause of the two great curses of all of­fice worker in­boxes: “CC” and “re­ply all”.</p>
    <p>Of­ten the pri­mary func­tion of these e-mails is to pro­vide rear­guard cover to the sender – a byte-size demon­stra­tion of pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers are a drag be­cause e-mail has long ceased to be the best op­tion for col­lab­o­ra­tion on projects. The ad­vent of cloud tools like Google Docs and Drop­box has made scrolling through a 30-deep chain of e-mails to find a doc­u­ment an ex­tremely in­ef­fi­cient way of keep­ing ev­ery­one in the loop. Business com­mu­ni­ca­tions plat­forms like Slack have also made such chains un­nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>I read­ily ad­mit I know many peo­ple who are com­pletely in con­trol of their e-mails. I as­sume they do not sleep.</p>
    <p>For me, e-mail use has be­come so dys­func­tional that, de­spite my best ef­forts, my re­sponse time is in­cred­i­bly er­ratic.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple will re­ceive a re­sponse nearly in­stan­ta­neously, hav­ing for­tu­itously sent me an e-mail at the very mo­ment when I am in the midst of work­ing on my e-mails. Oth­ers might re­ceive a re­ply only hours later when, in Google’s in­fi­nite wis­dom, it picked that e-mail along with a hand­ful of oth­ers from the moun­tain to dis­play in my phone’s no­ti­fi­ca­tion shade.</p>
    <p>Still oth­ers have been ig­nored so many times, they now fol­low up any e-mail with a mes­sage on Google Han­gouts say­ing: “Hey, I just sent you an e-mail. Can you please read it?”</p>
    <p>And those are just work e-mails. The best thing I can say about the mar­ket­ing e-mails is that I no longer re­ceive of­fers from</p>
    <p>Nige­rian roy­alty, chain mes­sages warn­ing of a curse if I do not for­ward them to 10 peo­ple im­me­di­ately, and mail­ers for dis­counts on creams or de­vices promis­ing to – how shall I put it – en­large my in­box.</p>
    <p>We also have e-mail to thank for such daily gifts in our lives as: mes­sages that are for­warded with noth­ing more than the let­ters FYI/A (for your in­for­ma­tion/ac­tion) ap­pended; mes­sages that are en­tirely in the sub­ject line such that the re­cip­i­ent spends a few sec­onds star­ing at a blank e-mail won­der­ing if some­thing went wrong; mes­sages that prom­ise an at­tach­ment but do not in­clude one, fol­lowed by an apol­ogy which oc­ca­sion­ally also does not in­clude the at­tach­ment; and of course, mes­sages sent to the whole of­fice be­cause the sender used “re­ply all” to re­spond to a com­pany-wide an­nounce­ment, fol­lowed by a slew of other mes­sages also sent us­ing the “re­ply all” func­tion, in­form­ing the ear­lier sender that they do not wish to re­ceive such mes­sages.</p>
    <p>Given the many ob­vi­ous draw­backs and the mul­ti­tude of at­trac­tive al­ter­na­tives, it should per­haps sur­prise no one that an In­ter­net search for e-mail trends shows that e-mail use is... ac­tu­ally grow­ing?</p>
    <p>Con­sumer data com­pany</p>
    <p>Statista es­ti­mates that around 306 bil­lion e-mails were sent each day this year. This is about 4 per cent higher than last year’s num­ber, and the com­pany ex­pects e-mail use to grow at about the same rate at least un­til 2024. All this de­spite anec­do­tal ev­i­dence that younger In­ter­net users are in­creas­ingly shun­ning e-mail.</p>
    <p>Statista did not of­fer an ex­pla­na­tion for the en­dur­ing ap­peal of e-mail, but as I thought it through, I re­alised that de­spite all my com­plaints, I do still need e-mail.</p>
    <p>It may not do the same things for us as it did in the past and it an­noys in a myr­iad of other ways. but there re­main many things that e-mail is the best tool for.</p>
    <p>It is re­ally the only truly univer­sal way to com­mu­ni­cate on­line. There is no need to check if the re­cip­i­ent has the same in­stant mes­sag­ing app as you or is part of the same so­cial net­work­ing plat­form. While only Ap­ple users can send iMes­sages to each other, there are no such re­stric­tions for e-mail.</p>
    <p>If they have an e-mail ad­dress, they will be able to re­ceive your e-mail, re­gard­less of the age of their de­vice, whether it is a mo­bile phone or a desk­top com­puter, and whether the United States gov­ern­ment has placed sanc­tions on its man­u­fac­turer.</p>
    <p>It also oc­cu­pies an in­dis­pens­able mid­dle ground on tone be­tween the in­for­mal­ity of in­stant mes­sag­ing and the for­mal­ity of a sub­poena. I shud­der to think what would hap­pen if ev­ery­one who or­di­nar­ily reaches out via e-mail sud­denly de­cided to flood my What­sApp.</p>
    <p>I wish I had some in­sight­ful sug­ges­tions on how to im­prove the ex­pe­ri­ence of e-mail, but I don’t. Part of this is down to the fact that there are al­ready many such tips out there on how to use e-mail prop­erly, and part of this is down to the fact that my in­box is proof most peo­ple do not fol­low these tips.</p>
    <p>Like all tech­nol­ogy, there may come a day when a new hot ser­vice will make e-mail a niche prod­uct, the pre­serve of some tech hip­sters hark­ing back to sim­pler times. That day may not come for a while.</p>
    <p>All that is left is to em­brace e-mail as the im­per­fect but crit­i­cal tool that it is, and, in the name of fresh starts, to click “se­lect all”.</p>
    <p>It is re­ally the only truly univer­sal way to com­mu­ni­cate on­line. There is no need to check if the re­cip­i­ent has the same in­stant mes­sag­ing app as you or is part of the same so­cial net­work­ing plat­form.
