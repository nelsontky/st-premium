    <p>LON­DON Premier League clubs will not be al­lowed to sign play­ers from Euro­pean Union (EU) coun­tries with­out a work per­mit while for­eign play­ers un­der the age of 18 can­not be signed at all as part of post-Brexit reg­u­la­tions, the league said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In a j oint state­ment with the coun­try’s gov­ern­ing foot­ball body (FA) and the English Foot­ball League (EFL), the Premier League said the reg­u­la­tions will come into ef­fect when the mid-sea­son trans­fer win­dow opens in Jan­uary 2021.</p>
    <p>With the UK leav­ing the EU on Dec 31, fol­low­ing a stand­still tran­si­tion pe­riod, the league sub­mit­ted the Gov­ern­ing Body En­dorse­ment (GBE) pro­posal to the gov­ern­ment last month and it has been ap­proved by the Home Of­fice.</p>
    <p>“Post-Brexit, clubs will not be able to sign play­ers freely from the EU,” the league said in a state­ment. “Play­ers from EU coun­tries who want to play in the Premier League or EFL will be re­quired to gain a GBE, like all other over­seas play­ers with­out the right to work in the UK.”</p>
    <p>The cri­te­ria to sign play­ers is based on a point sys­tem which con­sid­ers the num­ber of se­nior and youth in­ter­na­tional ap­pear­ances, club ap­pear­ances as well as the qual­ity of the sell­ing club, its league po­si­tion and league it­self.</p>
    <p>“Play­ers ac­cu­mu­lat­ing the req­ui­site amount of points will earn a GBE au­to­mat­i­cally, while play­ers just be­low the thresh­old may be con­sid­ered for a GBE by an ex­cep­tions panel,” it added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, un­der the new rules, clubs will no longer be al­lowed to sign over­seas play­ers un­til they turn 18.</p>
    <p>Premier League clubs will be al­lowed to sign a max­i­mum of three Un­der-21 play­ers in Jan­uary and will be lim­ited to six per sea­son.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tions will be re­viewed be­fore the trans­fer win­dow that opens af­ter the 2020-21 sea­son.</p>
    <p>“De­spite hav­ing dif­fer­ent start­ing per­spec­tives on how Brexit should im­pact foot­ball, this is another ex­am­ple of how the foot­ball au­thor­i­ties can work ef­fec­tively to­gether for the greater good of the game,” FA chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Mark Bulling­ham said.</p>
    <p>Richard Masters, the Premier League’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, added: “The Premier League has worked with the FA to come to an agree­ment to en­sure no part of Brexit should dam­age the suc­cess of the Premier League, or the prospects of the Eng­land teams.”</p>
