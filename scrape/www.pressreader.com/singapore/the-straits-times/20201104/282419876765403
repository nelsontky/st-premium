    <p>POS­SI­BIL­I­TIES AMID DIS­RUP­TION Covid-19, in its ironic way, has forced com­pa­nies, whether big or small, to em­brace tech­nol­ogy and the pos­si­bil­i­ties of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion to bring com­pa­nies to new mar­kets. NA­TIONAL TRADES UNION CONGRESS SEC­RE­TARY-GEN­ERAL NG CHEE MENG, on the op­por­tu­ni­ties that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has pro­vided.</p>
    <p>There are many pos­si­bil­i­ties and new op­por­tu­ni­ties for the fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy sec­tor amid the Covid-19 pan­demic which will also gen­er­ate jobs here, said labour chief Ng Chee Meng yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who is the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) sec­re­tary-gen­eral, told a vir­tual au­di­ence at the Dig­i­tal Bank­ing Sym­po­sium: “Covid-19, in its ironic way, has forced com­pa­nies, whether big or small, to em­brace tech­nol­ogy and the pos­si­bil­i­ties of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion to bring com­pa­nies to new mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>The two-day sym­po­sium, which ends to­day, is or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech As­so­ci­a­tion (SFA) and the Bank­ing and Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices Union.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng noted that the bank­ing and fi­nance sec­tor is a “bright spark” in the Covid-dis­rupted economy, post­ing year-on-year growth of 3.4 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter. Pre­lim­i­nary find­ings by SFA have shown that fin­tech firms are still ex­pand­ing their busi­nesses and work­force, he added.</p>
    <p>SFA pres­i­dent Chia Hock Lai said: “This is a cru­cial time for the in­dus­try. De­spite the chal­lenges be­ing faced, the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore is at the brink of dis­rup­tion. The emer­gence of dig­i­tal banks in Sin­ga­pore will open doors for sev­eral op­por­tu­ni­ties for jobs and col­lab­o­ra­tions. We be­lieve Sin­ga­pore will once again be able to look out­ward and strengthen its po­si­tion as the leading fin­tech hub and fi­nan­cial cen­tre in Asean and be­yond.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng agreed, say­ing: “A new chap­ter is open­ing for the Sin­ga­pore fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor for com­pa­nies and work­ers in­clud­ing pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs).</p>
    <p>“With time, we will def­i­nitely see fewer phys­i­cal banks and more dig­i­tal banks of­fer­ing ser­vices as com­pa­nies and peo­ple de­sire more con­ve­nience through tech­no­log­i­cal and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts...This will also mean that there will be a great im­pact on jobs and work­ers. Fi­nance pro­fes­sion­als may need to broaden knowl­edge be­yond what they cur­rently do, in­crease dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties and deepen ex­per­tise in ar­eas like data an­a­lyt­ics.”</p>
    <p>He added that there may be more de­mand for jobs in ar­eas like user in­ter­face and user ex­pe­ri­ence de­sign and cloud ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said the fin­tech space can also of­fer jobs in busi­ness developmen­t, mar­ket­ing and sales, be­sides those in tech.</p>
    <p>But the chal­lenge is to find peo­ple with the right skills, he said. Those in ad­ja­cent in­dus­tries, with do­main knowl­edge and net­works, can also find roles in dig­i­tal banks.</p>
    <p>“I hope Sin­ga­pore­ans, in­clud­ing those af­fected by un­em­ploy­ment, re­trench­ments and even the ma­ture PMEs, keep an open mind,” he said. “Em­ploy­ers prob­a­bly can­not find a 100 per cent match... but if they can find some­one who is al­most there but just needs a bit of beef­ing up of skills, I hope they keep their op­tions open too.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng urged em­ploy­ers to re­design jobs where nec­es­sary and train work­ers. He noted that banks have helped their work­ers with this, with DBS reskilling more than 500 con­tact cen­tre staff to take on new roles and Citi launch­ing a pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme to help some 400 work­ers.</p>
    <p>“I en­cour­age work­ers to keep an open mind and... take up some cour­ses to up­grade your own skills so you can seize op­por­tu­ni­ties... to up­grade your­selves... so you can en­hance your value and em­ploy­a­bil­ity as you pre­pare for the jobs of to­mor­row.”</p>
