    <p>CISCO WE­BEX MEET­INGS</p>
    <p>Avail­able on PC, Mac, An­droid and iOS</p>
    <p>This app is prob­a­bly best suited to com­pa­nies al­ready us­ing Cisco’s ex­ten­sive video-con­fer­enc­ing hard­ware.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it also of­fers a free plan for in­di­vid­u­als. And due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, Cisco has in­creased the scale of the free plan to 100 par­tic­i­pants (up from 50 pre­vi­ously) in each meet­ing.</p>
    <p>You can also now meet for 50 min­utes in each meet­ing with the free plan (it was lim­ited to 40 min­utes pre­vi­ously).</p>
    <p>When you sign up, you will re­ceive your per­sonal meet­ing-room link. Thus, it is easy for par­tic­i­pants to join your meet­ing. The only down­side is you do not have much ac­cess to the round-the-clock cus­tomer sup­port with the free plan.</p>
    <p>I have joined sev­eral video-con­fer­ence meet­ings in We­bEx and found the app in­tu­itive and easy to use.</p>
    <p>The video-stream­ing and au­dio qual­ity re­mains solid even when I was talk­ing to some­one in the United States.</p>
    <p>GOOGLE MEET</p>
    <p>Avail­able on Chrome</p>
    <p>(PC and Mac), An­droid and iOS</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously known as Google Han­gouts Meet, this app is a no-brainer if you are work­ing in a com­pany that is us­ing Google’s G Suite sys­tem. De­pend­ing on the price plan, Google Meet can al­low video con­fer­ences of up to</p>
    <p>250 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>With the app’s clean in­ter­face, it is easy to cre­ate and in­vite col­leagues to a video-con­fer­ence meet­ing by get­ting a meet­ing link to share, sched­ul­ing a meet­ing in Google Cal­en­dar or start­ing an in­stant meet­ing.</p>
    <p>With the lat­est up­date, the Gmail mo­bile app in­cludes a Meet icon for you to quickly set up or join meet­ings. There is also a live cap­tion­ing fea­ture that needs to be en­abled by in­di­vid­ual users.</p>
    <p>It is also now free for any in­di­vid­ual with a Gmail ac­count, though lim­ited to an hour of video call (through Sept 30) and up to 100 par­tic­i­pants for each meet­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, you will need to sign up for the Meet ac­count as a se­cu­rity mea­sure.</p>
    <p>MI­CROSOFT TEAMS</p>
    <p>Avail­able on PC, Mac, An­droid and iOS</p>
    <p>For in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses us­ing Mi­crosoft’s Of­fice 365 pro­duc­tiv­ity suite, the Mi­crosoft Teams video-con­fer­enc­ing app is the ob­vi­ous choice.</p>
    <p>Plus, it al­lows you to get a free ac­count as long as you have a Mi­crosoft ID, such as an out­look.com or hot­mail.com ID.</p>
    <p>With a free Teams ac­count, you can in­vite up to 300 peo­ple (in­clu­sive of your­self) to a video-con­fer­enc­ing call. How­ever, there is a time limit of 24 hours a ses­sion.</p>
    <p>You can also share what is on your screen dur­ing the video meet­ings, such as your desk­top, a Pow­erPoint pre­sen­ta­tion or file.</p>
    <p>You can also share and edit con­tent in real time dur­ing video meet­ings us­ing Of­fice apps such as Word, Ex­cel and Pow­erPoint.</p>
    <p>The paid ver­sion of Teams of­fers fea­tures such as meet­ing record­ings and ad­min­is­tra­tive tools for man­ag­ing users and apps.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in­di­vid­ual users and most small busi­nesses prob­a­bly do not need these ad­vanced fea­tures.</p>
    <p>ZOOM CLOUD MEET­INGS</p>
    <p>Avail­able on PC, Mac, An­droid and iOS</p>
    <p>Zoom re­ceived plenty of flak in the early days of the Covid-19 pan­demic due to “Zoom-bomb­ing”, or peo­ple hi­jack­ing Zoom video-con­fer­ence calls.</p>
    <p>How­ever, those in­ci­dents were more due to meet­ing hosts not en­abling se­cu­rity fea­tures like set­ting pass­words for meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Now, these se­cu­rity fea­tures are en­abled by de­fault, so no such loop­holes can be ex­ploited by “Zoom-bombers”.</p>
    <p>There is a rea­son Zoom has ex­ploded in pop­u­lar­ity dur­ing the pan­demic. It is easy to use yet pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>Sign­ing up is a breeze and a few clicks after you have done that, you will be talk­ing to your friends, col­leagues or fam­ily in video meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Its free plan al­lows up to</p>
    <p>100 par­tic­i­pants and an un­lim­ited num­ber of meet­ings. How­ever, there is a 40-minute limit on group meet­ings. Fur­ther­more, not many video-con­fer­enc­ing apps al­low you to touch up your ap­pear­ance like Zoom, so you will al­ways look good dur­ing video calls.</p>
    <p>CLICKMEETI­NG</p>
    <p>Avail­able on desk­top browsers, An­droid and iOS</p>
    <p>For small busi­nesses that need to hold we­bi­nars (with a pre­sen­ter and at­ten­dees) on a reg­u­lar ba­sis, this app is a good op­tion.</p>
    <p>It of­fers an easy, step-by-step way of set­ting up an ac­count and cre­at­ing we­bi­nars. You can cre­ate a cus­tomised URL for the we­bi­nar, so your at­ten­dees can re­mem­ber it eas­ily.</p>
    <p>When cre­at­ing a we­bi­nar, you can choose to have a sched­uled or per­ma­nent event. The lat­ter is great for re­cur­ring meet­ings.</p>
    <p>We­bi­nars will be­gin only when the pre­sen­ter joins the event. There is a draw­ing tool that al­lows the pre­sen­ter to high­light text and draw on the pre­sen­ta­tion dur­ing the event.</p>
    <p>It does not have a free plan – only a 30-day free trial. After that, you can opt for the cheap­est plan at US$25 (S$34) a month (billed an­nu­ally), which lets you have one pre­sen­ter and up to 25 at­ten­dees.</p>
    <p>ClickMeeti­ng of­fers plans for we­bi­nars sup­port­ing up to four pre­sen­ters and 1,000 at­ten­dees.</p>
