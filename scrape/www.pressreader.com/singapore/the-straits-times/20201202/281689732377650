    <p>Pro­fes­sor Theodore G. Hopf’s dis­missal yes­ter­day marks the third time in re­cent months that the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) has taken ac­tion against a staff mem­ber or for­mer staff mem­ber for in­ap­pro­pri­ate con­duct.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Dr Jeremy Fer­nando, a fel­low at Tem­busu Col­lege who was ac­cused of sex­ual mis­con­duct, was fired.</p>
    <p>NUS said it con­ducted an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion af­ter it re­ceived two com­plaints al­leg­ing that Dr Fer­nando had “be­haved in­ap­pro­pri­ately as a teach­ing staff”.</p>
    <p>Last month, NUS also said it had de­ter­mined that a for­mer di­rec­tor of the univer­sity’s East Asian In­sti­tute, Pro­fes­sor Zheng Yong­nian, had be­haved in­ap­pro­pri­ately with a sub­or­di­nate by hug­ging her with­out her con­sent dur­ing a work meet­ing.</p>
    <p>He would have been given a writ­ten warn­ing for his con­duct, but as Prof Zheng had left the univer­sity in Septem­ber, NUS recorded the out­come of its in­ter­nal re­view in its staff records, the univer­sity said.</p>
    <p>A raft of sex­ual ha­rass­ment al­le­ga­tions in­volv­ing Prof Zheng had sur­faced in Au­gust and Septem­ber on so­cial me­dia, from so­cial me­dia users who iden­ti­fied them­selves as NUS staff.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the state­ment,</p>
    <p>Prof Zheng, who spoke through his lawyers, main­tained his in­no­cence.</p>
    <p>He has said his res­ig­na­tion had noth­ing to do with the sex­ual ha­rass­ment al­le­ga­tions and com­plaints.</p>
