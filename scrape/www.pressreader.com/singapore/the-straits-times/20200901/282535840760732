    <p>Even as most Sin­ga­porean foot­ballers are still wait­ing to play their first com­pet­i­tive match in months due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, three Li­ons re­sumed action over­seas in an un­beaten weekend.</p>
    <p>In Nor­way, for­ward Ikhsan Fandi scored his first goal in his first start for sec­ond-tier Rau­foss this sea­son as they came from be­hind to beat Asane 3-1 on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old climbed high­est to glance in a cross from right-back Ed­vard Race in the 38th minute to give Rau­foss a 2-1 lead, and put in a solid at­tack­ing and de­fen­sive shift on the left flank be­fore be­ing re­placed in the 72nd minute.</p>
    <p>The vic­tory snaps a seven-game win­less streak and lifts Rau­foss to 12th in the 16-team league. They have 13 points from 13 games, which takes into ac­count a one­point de­duc­tion for poor fi­nan­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Ikhsan had made four sub­sti­tute ap­pear­ances ear­lier in the sea­son af­ter re­cov­er­ing from a knee in­jury and sore throat. Last sea­son, he played in 26 league games, in­clud­ing 10 as a starter, and scored five goals in his de­but sea­son in Europe.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “It’s nice to get the op­por­tu­nity to start. I didn’t kick off the sea­son well as I was out for six weeks with my in­jury and ill­ness, so it feels good to be back in the team, score and help the team win three points.</p>
    <p>“When the cross came in, I knew ex­actly where I was go­ing to put it and from the way I con­nected, I knew 100 per cent it was go­ing in. It’s im­por­tant for strik­ers to score and take that con­fi­dence to the next game.</p>
    <p>“For now, I’m fo­cus­ing on build­ing my match fit­ness and en­joy­ing my foot­ball. I feel I’m at 80 per cent now and I want to play more and help my team, whether as a starter or sub.”</p>
    <p>Nearer to home, the Malaysian Su­per League (MSL) re­sumed on Aug 22 when Tereng­ganu beat PJ City 2-0.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore for­ward Faris Ramli did not play for the Tur­tles in that game as he had yet to com­plete his quar­an­tine. But he played his part on Satur­day as he rounded up the scor­ing by slot­ting into an empty net in the 4-0 win over Sabah as Tereng­ganu rise to sec­ond in the 12-team MSL with 10 points, three be­hind de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Jo­hor</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>Ikhsan’s goal came af­ter five Rau­foss ap­pear­ances in the sec­ond-tier Nor­we­gian league this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Darul Takzim (JDT).</p>
    <p>It was a be­lated birth­day present for Faris, who turned 28 on Aug 24.</p>
    <p>He glee­fully de­scribed the feel­ing of play­ing his first com­pet­i­tive game in more than five months as “like a kid get­ting candy”. Be­fore go­ing to Tereng­ganu on Aug 11, he had trained with the Young Li­ons in Sin­ga­pore for about three weeks.</p>
    <p>Faris said: “Train­ing with Young Li­ons was all about get­ting back my fit­ness, and then slowly I got back my touches. It was not re­ally dif­fi­cult as I was al­ready work­ing out at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps I’m a lit­tle rusty on the pitch, and still lack­ing in terms of the agility and sharp turns, but I’m def­i­nitely get­ting there.</p>
    <p>“We have some re­ally promis­ing young play­ers and a smart and tac­ti­cal coach who wants foot­ball to be played on the ground. It fits my style of foot­ball and I’m look­ing for­ward to a good sea­son with Tereng­ganu.”</p>
    <p>De­fender Sa­fuwan Ba­harudin also helped eighth-placed Se­lan­gor keep a clean sheet in the goal­less draw with PJ City.</p>
    <p>Two other Sin­ga­pore­ans ply their trade for MSL teams but did not play last weekend as JDT skip­per Hariss Harun is still re­cov­er­ing from knee surgery, while Kedah de­fender Shakir Hamzah was serv­ing a one-match sus­pen­sion.</p>
