    <p>Some­times the Premier League fix­tures list pro­vides a Cham­pi­ons League play-off of sorts. It was Chelsea against Liverpool in 2003.</p>
    <p>Now it is Le­ices­ter against Manchester United, with the same prize for the win­ners; or, in United’s case, those who draw. A point to­mor­row would keep them above Le­ices­ter and thus in the top four.</p>
    <p>The Eu­ropa League of­fers a sec­ond po­ten­tial path into the Cham­pi­ons League, but it is lit­tered with ob­sta­cles, from Roma to In­ter Mi­lan, Sevilla to Getafe, Wolves to Wolfs­burg. The easiest route goes via Le­ices­ter.</p>
    <p>The con­se­quences if United stum­ble are con­sid­er­able. They are savvy enough to build Cham­pi­ons League bonuses into play­ers’ con­tracts, so their salaries are lower in years when they are not in the Euro­pean elite.</p>
    <p>But so is their in­come: United got €93.4 mil­lion (S$150 mil­lion) from</p>
    <p>Uefa for play­ing in the 2018-19 Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>This year’s Eu­ropa League will be far less lu­cra­tive. There is a knockon for com­mer­cial con­tracts and their kit deal with Adi­das is worth £22.5 mil­lion (S$39.6 mil­lion) less next sea­son if they are not in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>So United’s rev­enue will be hit while their fi­nances are al­ready be­ing dam­aged by the coro­n­avirus; per­haps by about £100 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Their plans would have to change. Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has been right in his re­cruit­ment to pri­ori­tise qual­ity over quan­tity, look­ing largely for younger play­ers even when they cost pre­mium prices.</p>
    <p>But, with­out Cham­pi­ons League in­come, United surely can­not af­ford Jadon San­cho, es­pe­cially as Borus­sia Dort­mund would de­mand £100 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>With­out the car­rot of the com­pe­ti­tion, would San­cho even want to come?</p>
    <p>Rewind to 2012 and Eden Haz­ard might have joined United had Chelsea not won the Cham­pi­ons League to qual­ify for the next sea­son’s tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>Then there is Paul Pogba’s sit­u­a­tion. The French­man is rec­on­ciled to stay­ing, aided by United’s re­nais­sance. But a World Cup win­ner would surely eye a trans­fer to Cham­pi­ons League reg­u­lars next year if United’s re­cent re­vival starts to feel a false dawn.</p>
    <p>And that 19-game un­beaten reign could look the sec­ond mi­rage of Sol­sk­jaer’s reign if an FA Cup semi-fi­nal de­feat by Chelsea is fol­lowed by a tame end to the Premier League.</p>
    <p>United would be stripped of a feel­good fac­tor and mo­men­tum. The doubts if Sol­sk­jaer is good enough would resur­face. He may never re­cover. The di­rec­tion of the club could change.</p>
    <p>Be­cause squeez­ing into the Cham­pi­ons League still counts. For years, Arsene Wenger spe­cialised in such brinkman­ship, de­lay­ing Arse­nal’s de­cline.</p>
    <p>In 2017 and 2018, Liverpool sealed their top-four place on only the last day. Both times, they reached the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal 12 months later.</p>
    <p>And with­out Chelsea’s win over Liverpool in 2003, Roman Abramovich might not have bought them.</p>
    <p>It may not be quite that big for United, but this is still a cross­roads.</p>
