    <p>Hyflux has re­ceived a for­mal ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est from an Amer­i­can fund man­ager to in­vest at least $204.78 mil­lion, the water treat­ment com­pany said in a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing two days be­fore an ap­pli­ca­tion to put it un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment will be heard.</p>
    <p>Delaware-based Strate­gic Growth In­vest­ments (SGI) pro­posed the funds to be in­jected as newly-is­sued com­mon eq­uity into Hyflux, and to be ap­plied to set­tle all debts, claims and li­a­bil­i­ties of the group.</p>
    <p>Se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors will get the lion’s share of $97 mil­lion, trade cred­i­tors $15.78 mil­lion and the per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares (PnP) in­vestors $32 mil­lion – all on a pro-rata ba­sis, pro­posed SGI.</p>
    <p>Also, it was pro­posed that $60 mil­lion from the in­vest­ment be set aside for work­ing cap­i­tal and any future cor­po­rate restruc­tur­ing, based on the value cre­ation plan de­signed and im­ple­mented with SGI’s ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>The Hyflux an­nounce­ment to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) yes­ter­day came two days be­fore the High Court hears the ju­di­cial man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tion by the un­se­cured work­ing group of bank­ing cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Hyflux’s lat­est suitor SGI is pre­pared to of­fer up to 15 per cent of the eq­uity in the treat­ment com­pany post-in­vest­ment in the form of war­rants, with 5 per cent of the eq­uity go­ing to the se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors and 10 per cent to the PnP hold­ers.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing the suc­cess­ful im­ple­men­ta­tion of SGI’s value cre­ation plan, the value of the eq­uity war­rants could be worth about $196.7 mil­lion for the se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors and $393.3 mil­lion for the PnP hold­ers, ac­cord­ing to the ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est let­ter.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to SGI, its prin­ci­pals have in­vested in, owned and cre­ated value for com­pa­nies across sev­eral ver­ti­cals, in­clud­ing tech­nol­ogy, in­dus­tri­als/ man­u­fac­tur­ing, in­fra­struc­ture and en­ergy.</p>
    <p>This lat­est de­vel­op­ment fol­lows Hyflux ask­ing its Mid­dle East­ern suitor Utico to ad­dress con­cerns flagged by cred­i­tor groups, be­fore a vir­tual town­hall can be held for the com­pany’s PnP in­vestors.</p>
    <p>In this way, the town­hall will be use­ful, its in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor Lau Wing Tat said in a let­ter to Utico re­leased to SGX last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau also high­lighted that the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), or Sias, does not in­tend to en­dorse Utico’s of­fer based on its cur­rent terms, and that Utico has yet to con­vince the medi­umterm note in­for­mal steer­ing com­mit­tee and/or the un­se­cured work­ing group (UWG) to sup­port its cur­rent of­fer.</p>
    <p>Hyflux’s let­ter re­ferred to an Oct 9 Utico let­ter, in which Utico asked</p>
    <p>Hyflux to ar­range a vir­tual town­hall with PnP in­vestors on ei­ther last Satur­day af­ter­noon or Sun­day evening.</p>
    <p>The Utico let­ter noted Sias had re­ceived “few re­sponses” to its let­ter to PnP in­vestors on Sept 25, which was based on Utico’s of­fer on July 23.</p>
    <p>Among other things, Utico noted last Satur­day that “Hyflux (on Satur­day) de­layed the PnP vir­tual town­hall to give Pi­son time to make an of­fer to PnP work­ing with Sias”.</p>
    <p>Pi­son In­vest­ments is among other po­ten­tial Hyflux suit­ors.</p>
    <p>But Sias “is­sued a let­ter to Hyflux on Oct 7 that there are no of­fers to PnP other than Utico”, it added.</p>
    <p>Utico also said in Hyflux’s own state­ment, “UWG has asked Pi­son to en­sure PnP agrees to their of­fer, prior to UWG en­gag­ing with in­vestors, in­clud­ing Pi­son”.</p>
    <p>Utico said: “Three rep­re­sen­ta­tive sam­ple votes from PnP have given ma­jor­ity ap­proval for Utico’s of­fer so far – the only ap­provals Hyflux has re­ceived for any of­fer to PnP.”</p>
