    <p>BUDAPEST • Lewis Hamil­ton leads the For­mula One world cham­pi­onship af­ter three races and Mercedes team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas al­ready looks like the only man who can deny the Bri­ton a record­e­qualling seventh ti­tle.</p>
    <p>That is the view of Fer­rari duo Se­bas­tian Vet­tel and Charles Le­clerc, whose hopes of build­ing on last year’s chal­lenge have melted away amid the strug­gles the SF1000 car is hav­ing with straight-line speed.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton (63 points) dom­i­nated Sun­day’s Hun­gar­ian Grand Prix from pole to fin­ish, tak­ing a five­point lead over Bot­tas, the win­ner of the Aus­trian sea­son-opener, while Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen is third over­all, 30 points off the lead in the driv­ers’ stand­ings.</p>
    <p>Asked whether they could see a sce­nario where Hamil­ton might not be cham­pion at the end of the sea­son, Vet­tel and Le­clerc agreed it was un­likely.</p>
    <p>“I think (only) if Valt­teri wins the cham­pi­onship,” said Ger­man Vet­tel, a four-time world cham­pion.</p>
    <p>Monaco na­tive Le­clerc added: “Lewis is ob­vi­ously the main con­tender. The only one that could prob­a­bly stop him do­ing that is Valt­teri.”</p>
    <p>With F1 not in ac­tion un­til Aug 2, Fer­rari plan to use the mini-break to get to the bot­tom of their prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“We were not ex­pect­ing such a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion – it’s cer­tainly worse com­pared to ex­pec­ta­tions,” said team boss Mat­tia Binotto.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got a cou­ple of weeks be­fore Sil­ver­stone. It will be im­por­tant for us back in Maranello to con­sider all the as­pects of the car, in our or­gan­i­sa­tion, what­ever needs to be im­proved.</p>
    <p>“The deficit at the mo­ment is still there. We are lack­ing speed on the straights, we are lack­ing speed in cor­ner­ing. Over­all, the car has to be im­proved in all ar­eas. It will take some time. It’s not some­thing that can be ad­dressed in a few weeks.”</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Mercedes, win­ners of the past six driv­ers’ cham­pi­onships, have no such wor­ries af­ter start­ing this term with three wins and three poles. They are al­ready 66 points clear of clos­est ri­vals Red Bull.</p>
    <p>With the Sil­ver Ar­rows win­ning the first eight races last sea­son, it is lit­tle won­der why their ri­vals ap­pear de­spon­dent over their cham­pi­onship chances as this sea­son is mir­ror­ing the last.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton, fourth in the opener at the Red Bull Ring, has al­ready won two in a row and the next two races are at his home Sil­ver­stone cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>While the Bri­ton has re­futed sug­ges­tions the cham­pi­onship is in dan­ger of be­com­ing a pro­ces­sion, he ad</p>
    <p>Mercedes’ lead over clos­est chal­lengers Red Bull in the con­struc­tors’ stand­ings af­ter the open­ing three races. mit­ted he had ex­pected more of a fight so far.</p>
    <p>“I think the Red Bulls have been do­ing a great job and I’m sure at some stage they’re go­ing to make some im­prove­ments as we get into the sea­son,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I’m hope­ful we will still find some chal­lenges up ahead.”</p>
    <p>The ev­i­dence sug­gests Mercedes are on an­other level, how­ever, with Hamil­ton lap­ping all but three cars be­hind him be­fore his fi­nal pit stop in Hun­gary.</p>
    <p>Such dom­i­nance means he has been able to push his anti-racism stance to the top of the sport’s agenda with­out be­ing pri­mar­ily pre­oc­cu­pied with driv­ing.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old in­tends to write to F1 bosses to give driv­ers, who wish to “take a knee” with him at fu­ture pre-race cer­e­monies, more time to carry out their protests.</p>
    <p>Ex­press­ing his un­hap­pi­ness at how rushed Sun­day’s cer­e­mony had been, he also hit out at Haas’ Ro­main Gros­jean for not be­liev­ing it was nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>On the French driver, who is the chair­man of the Grand Prix Driv­ers As­so­ci­a­tion, he said: “He doesn’t think it’s im­por­tant to do it – he’s one of them that thinks it was done once and that’s all we need to do.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it’s be­ing taken se­ri­ously. There are per­haps peo­ple who have not grown up around it so they don’t un­der­stand it.</p>
    <p>“There are peo­ple out there who are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing dis­crim­i­na­tion, that’s what we’re fight­ing for – we’re try­ing to change in or­gan­i­sa­tions.”</p>
