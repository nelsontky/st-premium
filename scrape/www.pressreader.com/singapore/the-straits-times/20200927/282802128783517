    <p>Day and night, two peren­ni­ally long queues snake around base­ment level four of Ion Or­chard, at the open space un­der the es­ca­la­tors.</p>
    <p>They do not ap­pear to lead any­where. The only clue lies in two signs at the head of the lines. One reads Hang He­ung and the other, Joy Luck Tea­house.</p>
    <p>Both brands opened j ust last month, tak­ing up small units across from each other, sell­ing pas­tries and snacks from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>A con­flu­ence of fac­tors, in­clud­ing stress-snack­ing and the in­abil­ity to travel dur­ing the pan­demic, has led to their roaring busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Joy Luck Tea­house is a take­away stall sell­ing three fa­mous brands – Hoover Cake Shop egg tarts, Kam Kee Cafe pineapple buns and milk tea, as well as Tak Hing Fish­ball Com­pany’s Hong Kong curry fish balls.</p>
    <p>It is a con­cept by vet­eran tele­vi­sion pro­ducer Robert Chua, a Sin­ga­porean liv­ing in Hong Kong who pre­vi­ously brought in Kam’s Roast, a Miche­lin-starred roast meat spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>Hang He­ung, on the other hand, is a fran­chise of a 100-year-old Hong Kong brand that is fa­mous for its tra­di­tional Can­tonese pas­tries – in­clud­ing its wife cakes, a flaky pas­try with a win­ter melon fill­ing.</p>
    <p>This and five other pas­tries such as mini egg yolk cake and mung bean paste cake are baked at the Sin­ga­pore shop daily. Other items such as egg rolls and cook­ies are flown in from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Fran­chisee Wabi-Sabi SG’s Mr Alvin Ng said the re­sponse over the past month has been over­whelm­ing. Up to 500 boxes of the best-sell­ing wife cakes are snapped up a day.</p>
    <p>He pre­vi­ously brought in two pop­u­lar Ja­panese brands – LeTao Hokkaido cheese­cake and Tokyo Milk Cheese Fac­tory – and while both at­tracted queues when they opened, they were not as long.</p>
    <p>He at­tributes the warm re­sponse to Hang He­ung partly to de­pri­va­tion, as peo­ple can­not make reg­u­lar jaunts to Hong Kong to buy the pas­tries th­ese days.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides the qual­ity of the prod­uct, there is pent-up de­mand. We’re bring­ing the world to Sin­ga­pore in a sense,” he said.</p>
    <p>On week­ends, the num­ber of peo­ple stand­ing in line goes up to 40, which trans­lates into a twohour wait. Part of the prob­lem is that only four cus­tomers at a time are al­lowed in the store be­cause of Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions. And, with 25 prod­ucts to choose from, many take their time to browse.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said: “There is also no sam­pling al­lowed, so buy­ing re­ac­tion is slower.”</p>
    <p>To quicken the process, he gets his staff to dis­trib­ute fly­ers to those in the queue so they can pe­ruse what is on sale and make de­ci­sions while wait­ing.</p>
    <p>The shop also re­stricts cus­tomers to buy­ing only two boxes of wife cakes each time.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng added: “Many of our cus­tomers are el­derly peo­ple and we would rather they not stand for so long. But with the cur­rent re­stric­tions, there isn’t much we can do.”</p>
    <p>His ad­vice is to go on week­days or in the morn­ing when the wait short­ens to half an hour. “Usu­ally, about 10 to 20 peo­ple join the line around half an hour be­fore we open at 11am.”</p>
    <p>He hopes to find a sec­ond shop space that can be used to fa­cil­i­tate de­liv­ery as well. “It’s not easy to pack flaky pas­tries for de­liv­ery and we don’t want them to ar­rive in less than per­fect con­di­tions,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Over at Joy Luck Tea­house, the re­sponse is no less en­thu­si­as­tic. On its first day, a line formed an hour be­fore the stall opened. For the next few days, the wait ex­tended to up to three hours, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“But we have since im­proved our work­flow and the queue­ing time is around one hour now,” she added.</p>
    <p>The egg tarts are the bestseller­s, with about 2,000 pieces fly­ing off the shelves a day, fol­lowed by more than 1,000 pineapple buns and around 300 cups of milk tea. The busiest time is at 7pm, when typ­i­cally over 60 peo­ple stand in line.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans love Hong Kong food very much, and young and old came to sup­port us. We are grate­ful that so many peo­ple re­peat­edly queued for our prod­ucts,” added the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Another Hong Kong pas­try brand, Tai Cheong Bak­ery, which opened at Holland Vil­lage in late 2016, con­tin­ues to do a brisk busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Fran­chisee Food Peo­ple, a sub­sidiary of Palm Beach Group, has since ex­panded to four out­lets here. Mr Ti­mothy Han, who han­dles busi­ness de­vel­op­ment for Palm Beach, said that, on av­er­age, each out­let sells more than 2,000 pas­tries a day. Egg tarts are still the top sell­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “Tra­di­tion­ally, Hong Kong-style egg tarts are made us­ing a com­bi­na­tion of but­ter, mar­garine and/or lard. How­ever, we use only but­ter in our pas­try crust. This makes it richer and more fra­grant.”</p>
    <p>Queues re­main a com­mon sight, es­pe­cially at its Holland Vil­lage out­let, which serves a full range of hot dishes that in­cludes mac­a­roni and curry rice.</p>
    <p>“It is busiest on week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days. Queues may reach up to a 30-minute wait,” said Mr Han.</p>
    <p>The group is plan­ning to open two more out­lets, at Jem and Bukit Pan­jang Plaza.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve it is be­cause of Sin­ga­pore­ans’ fa­mil­iar­ity with Hong Kong cui­sine as well as the la­tent de­mand for pas­tries and baked goods in gen­eral. We see a trend of both Western and Asian bak­eries quickly gain­ing trac­tion and ac­cep­tance here,” he added.</p>
