    <p>In­done­sian ty­coon and chief ex­ec­u­tive of off­shore and marine com­pany KS En­ergy Kris Tae­nar Wiluan was charged yes­ter­day with 112 counts in re­la­tion to vi­o­la­tions of Sec­tion 197 of the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act, which deals with false trad­ing and mar­ket-rig­ging trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Wiluan, also founder of In­done­sia’s Citra­mas Group, was ac­cused of giv­ing in­struc­tions, ei­ther per­son­ally or through Ho Chee Yen, a man­ager em­ployed at his of­fice, to trad­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives from CIMB Se­cu­ri­ties (Sin­ga­pore) to buy shares of KS En­ergy through the trad­ing ac­count of Pa­cific One En­ergy, a com­pany he con­trolled.</p>
    <p>The pur­pose was to “push up” the share price of main­board-listed KS En­ergy on 112 trad­ing days be­tween Dec 19, 2014 and Sept 13, 2016, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore po­lice.</p>
    <p>Wiluan, 71, who was ranked In­done­sia’s 40th rich­est man by Forbes in 2009 with a per­sonal net worth of US$240 mil­lion (S$328 mil­lion), was also ac­cused of in­struct­ing Ngin Kim Choo, a CIMB Se­cu­ri­ties trad­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tive ser­vic­ing the trad­ing ac­count of Pa­cific One, to buy KS En­ergy’s shares to push up its prices dur­ing the said pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ho, 56, faces 92 counts of vi­o­lat­ing the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act for in­ten­tion­ally aid­ing Wiluan in the al­leged mar­ket rig­ging by re­lay­ing his in­struc­tions to Ngin and Yeo Jin Lui, an­other trader with CIMB Se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>If con­victed, the duo can be jailed for up to seven years and fined up to $250,000, for each charge of mar­ket rig­ging un­der the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Jimmy Yim and Mr Ma­hesh Rai of Drew & Napier, Wiluan, a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR), is out on court bail of $250,000.</p>
    <p>Ho, a Sin­ga­porean, who is be­ing rep­re­sented by Mr Chia Kok Seng of KSCGP Ju­ris, is out on court bail of $70,000. Both have also sur­ren­dered their pass­ports.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Wiluan and his son Richard James Wiluan were in­ter­viewed by the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment (CAD) in its in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the po­ten­tial con­tra­ven­tion of Sec­tion 197 of the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act. At the time, the el­der Wiluan posted po­lice bail and was re­leased af­ter his in­ter­view, while his son was re­leased with­out re­quir­ing bail.</p>
    <p>The com­pany told the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change in April 2017 that “both have in­formed the board that they have and will con­tinue to co­op­er­ate fully in the in­ves­ti­ga­tions, in­clud­ing grant­ing ac­cess to all their elec­tronic data, IT equip­ment and data stor­age de­vices from Jan­uary 2015”.</p>
    <p>KS En­ergy, in an SGX an­nounce­ment last night, said its busi­ness and oper­a­tions have not been af­fected and will con­tinue as usual. It added that Mr Richard James Wiluan has not been charged.</p>
    <p>Shares of KS En­ergy, cur­rently on SGX’s watch list, closed un­changed at 1.6 cents yes­ter­day.</p>
