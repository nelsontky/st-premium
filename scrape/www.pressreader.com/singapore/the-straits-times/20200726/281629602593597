    <p>For­mer man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive of IHH Health­care Tan See Leng, 55, has been ap­pointed a full min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The newly elected MP in Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC will be a Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice as well as Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power and Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In an­nounc­ing his new Cabi­net yes­ter­day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong brought up Dr Tan’s ex­pe­ri­ence as a med­i­cal pro­fes­sional and busi­ness en­tre­pre­neur, and said he would add a pri­vate sec­tor per­spec­tive to eco­nomic pol­i­cy­mak­ing, to make sure poli­cies are ef­fec­tive in help­ing busi­nesses and ad­dress­ing their prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing also posted to MOM ( Min­istry of Man­power), he will help align our eco­nomic and man­power poli­cies to re­in­force each other,” PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter said his Cabi­net needs peo­ple from the pri­vate sec­tor, “who have been on the re­ceiv­ing end of poli­cies, and who know what poli­cies can work and how the im­pact is on peo­ple and there­fore what can we do to help peo­ple, help com­pa­nies and busi­nesses and the pop­u­la­tion solve their prob­lems”.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Dr Tan, he also high­lighted new face Alvin Tan, who is di­rec­tor and head of pub­lic pol­icy and eco­nomics (Asia-Pa­cific) at LinkedIn, and back­bencher Ra­hayu Mahzam, a lawyer.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, 40, will take on the role of Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth and Trade and In­dus­try, while Ms Ra­hayu will be Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said Mr Tan’s knowl­edge of so­cial me­dia and the dig­i­tal me­dia in­dus­try will come in use­ful for his roles in the two min­istries.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said she has asked Dr Tan “to cham­pion the health and well­ness of our mi­grant work­ers while en­sur­ing im­prove­ments are sus­tain­able”.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan had co-founded Health­way Med­i­cal Group, a chain of neigh­bour­hood clin­ics.</p>
    <p>He prac­tised as a fam­ily physi­cian for more than a decade be­fore he sold the busi­ness in 2004 and later joined Park­way Hold­ings, now part of IHH Health­care.</p>
    <p>Un­der Dr Tan, IHH grew to be­come one of the world’s largest health­care groups with a net­work of 56 hos­pi­tals in Asia, in­clud­ing the Mount El­iz­a­beth and Gle­nea­gles hos­pi­tals in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He stepped down as man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the group on Dec 31 last year.</p>
    <p>Asked how he would bring his cor­po­rate ex­pe­ri­ence to bear in Cabi­net, Dr Tan told The Sun­day Times he had to nav­i­gate through dif­fer­ent gov­ern­ment poli­cies and cross dif­fer­ent hur­dles to do busi­ness when he</p>
