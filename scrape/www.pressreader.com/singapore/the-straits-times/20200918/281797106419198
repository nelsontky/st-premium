    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has re­jected the pro­fes­sional sci­en­tific con­clu­sions of his own gov­ern­ment about the prospects for a widely avail­able coron­avirus vac­cine and the ef­fec­tive­ness of masks in curb­ing the spread of the virus as the death toll in the United States from the dis­ease nears 200,000.</p>
    <p>In a re­mark­able dis­play even for him, Mr Trump on Wed­nes­day pub­licly slapped down Dr Robert Red­field, direc­tor of the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) and promised that a vac­cine could be avail­able in weeks and go “im­me­di­ately” to the gen­eral pub­lic, while di­min­ish­ing the use­ful­ness of masks de­spite ev­i­dence to the con­trary.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s com­ments put him at odds with the CDC, the world’s pre­mier pub­lic health agency, over the course of a pan­demic that he keeps in­sist­ing is “round­ing the cor­ner” to an end.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump lashed out just hours af­ter Dr Red­field told a Se­nate com­mit­tee that a vac­cine would not be widely avail­able un­til the mid­dle of next year and that masks were so vi­tal in fight­ing Covid-19 that they may be even more im­por­tant than a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“If you are ask­ing me when is it go­ing to be gen­er­ally avail­able to the Amer­i­can pub­lic so we can be­gin to take ad­van­tage of the vac­cine to get back to our reg­u­lar life, I think we are prob­a­bly look­ing at third – late sec­ond quar­ter, third quar­ter 2021,” Dr Red­field told the se­na­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump then told re­porters: “I think he made a mis­take when he said that. It’s just in­cor­rect in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>A vac­cine would go “to the gen­eral pub­lic im­me­di­ately”, he in­sisted, and “un­der no cir­cum­stance will it be as late as the doc­tor said”.</p>
    <p>As for Dr Red­field’s con­clu­sion that masks may be more use­ful than a vac­cine, Mr Trump said “he made a mis­take” and a “vac­cine is much more ef­fec­tive than the masks”.</p>
    <p>The sharply di­ver­gent mes­sages fur­ther un­der­cut any ef­fort to forge a co­her­ent re­sponse to the virus that United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res on Wed­nes­day called the “No. 1 global se­cu­rity threat in our world to­day”.</p>
    <p>With Mr Trump say­ing one thing and his health ad­vis­ers say­ing an­other, many Amer­i­cans have been left to fig­ure out on their own whom to be­lieve, with past polls show­ing that they have more faith in the ex­perts than their Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic scold­ing of Dr Red­field was only the lat­est but per­haps the stark­est in­stance of the Pres­i­dent re­ject­ing not just pol­icy ad­vice of his pub­lic health of­fi­cials but the facts and in­for­ma­tion that they pro­vided.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health of­fi­cials are in strong agree­ment about the value of masks even as Mr Trump gen­er­ally re­fuses to wear one, mocks his op­po­nent for do­ing so and twice in the past two days ques­tioned their util­ity based on the ad­vice of restau­rant wait­ers.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, health of­fi­cials have said that it will be many months be­fore a vac­cine can be dis­trib­uted to the pop­u­la­tion at large, al­low­ing life to be­gin re­turn­ing to a sem­blance of nor­mal, even as Mr Trump has promised to ap­prove one in time for the gen­eral elec­tion on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>By Mr Trump’s own ac­count, he per­son­ally called Dr Red­field af­ter Wed­nes­day’s hear­ing to chal­lenge his tes­ti­mony, re­new­ing ques­tions about pres­sure on sci­en­tists who are sup­posed to be iso­lated from par­ti­san pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>But with the elec­tion loom­ing, Mr Trump is in­tent on con­vinc­ing the pub­lic that the worst is be­hind the coun­try. He has re­peat­edly ex­pressed no re­gret about his han­dling of the threat, even with the death toll mount­ing.</p>
    <p>“We did a great job ex­cept, pub­lic re­la­tions-wise, my peo­ple got out­played,” he told Ms Greta Van Sus­teren of Gray Tele­vi­sion on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>For­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee, said that Mr Trump’s undis­guised fix­a­tion on the elec­tion cal­en­dar in declar­ing when a vac­cine will be avail­able has dam­aged his own cred­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“So let me be clear. I trust vac­cines. I trust the sci­en­tists, but I don’t trust Don­ald Trump,” said Mr Bi­den. “And at this mo­ment, the Amer­i­can peo­ple can’t ei­ther.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Pres­i­dent’s pub­lic dress­ing down, Dr Red­field tried to smooth over the rift by re­cal­i­brat­ing his own an­swers from ear­lier in the day. “I 100 per cent be­lieve in the im­por­tance of vac­cines and the im­por­tance in par­tic­u­lar of a Covid-19 vac­cine,” he said in a writ­ten state­ment.</p>
    <p>“A Covid-19 vac­cine is the thing that will get Amer­i­cans back to nor­mal ev­ery­day life. The best de­fence we cur­rently have against this virus are the im­por­tant mit­i­ga­tion ef­forts of wear­ing a mask, wash­ing your hands, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and be­ing care­ful about crowds.”</p>
