    <p>As is cus­tom­ary for the new year, many peo­ple will pledge to im­prove their health. Chief among their con­cerns will be wine and other al­co­holic bev­er­ages. Dry Jan­uarys have be­come fash­ion­able, as has what has come to be called the new so­bri­ety.</p>
    <p>I do not know whether the emo­tional cost of en­dur­ing a pan­demic for al­most a year will di­min­ish the ap­peal of a drink­ing hia­tus. It could be that a dry Jan­uary this year will go the way of dress­ing for work and reg­u­lar hair­cuts.</p>
    <p>But even if ab­sti­nence is out in 2021, wine has joined the clus­ter of men­tal and phys­i­cal health prac­tices that is now re­ferred to gen­er­ally as “well­ness”. Not in the sense that self-care re­quires ine­bri­a­tion, but in the sug­ges­tion that wine, like cloth­ing or beauty prod­ucts, can be pared of tox­ins and made “clean”.</p>
    <p>Most re­cently, we have seen the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of nat­u­ral wine, repack­aged for su­per­mar­ket wine shop­pers as “clean wine”. These bot­tles – with names like</p>
    <p>Won­der­ful Wine, Good Clean Wine and Pure the Win­ery – are in­tended to con­note im­mac­u­lacy, as sim­ple and hy­gienic as the nat­u­ral-fi­bre cloth­ing their pro­mot­ers ha­bit­u­ally wear.</p>
    <p>Each of these wines presents it­self as a re­ac­tion against a world of “un­health­ful” pro­cessed wines, bev­er­ages rou­tinely made from grapes grown with pes­ti­cides and her­bi­cides, and man­u­fac­tured us­ing ad­di­tives and tech­no­log­i­cal tricks.</p>
    <p>None of these com­pa­nies has made as big a splash or drawn as much crit­i­cism as Ava­line, pro­pelled by the celebrity of ac­tress Cameron Diaz and her busi­ness part­ner Kather­ine</p>
    <p>Power, a beauty en­tre­pre­neur, who in­tro­duced the brand in June last year.</p>
    <p>In an In­sta­gram post pro­mot­ing their brand, they de­scribed their shock at learn­ing that wine could be man­u­fac­tured like other pro­cessed foods.</p>
    <p>“I thought that it was just fer­mented grapes,” Diaz said. “It was one of those aha mo­ments, why don’t we make our own clean wine? Why don’t we make wine the way we want to drink wine? Not only are we go­ing to make it clean with­out all those ad­di­tives, but we’re also go­ing to make it or­gan­i­cally.”</p>
    <p>Though ad­di­tives and ma­nip­u­la­tions have been a hot topic in the wine world for 20 years or more, most ca­sual wine drinkers know lit­tle about what they are drink­ing and sim­ply want some­thing in­tox­i­cat­ing that tastes good, no ques­tions asked.</p>
    <p>But it is not clear why, aside from sens­ing a good busi­ness op­por­tu­nity, Diaz and Ms Power felt com­pelled to pro­vide the answer. Plenty of wines, whether mar­keted as nat­u­ral, are made with­out ad­di­tives, from or­ganic grapes. These wines are easy to find at any de­cent wine shop.</p>
    <p>That was not their aim. They wanted to make wine, they said, for peo­ple like them­selves and their friends, peo­ple for whom pa­tro­n­is­ing lo­cal shops is an in­con­ve­nience.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to bring it to your gro­cery store, not have to go across town to a spe­cial­ity store to get the wine or spe­cial or­der it,” Diaz said. In other words, Ava­line is for those who have never been cu­ri­ous how the sausage was made.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing is wrong with that, even if Diaz and Ms Power ex­ag­ger­ate the ills of con­ven­tional wines and the ben­e­fits of Ava­line. And they have cor­rected some of their ini­tial prob­lems, like promis­ing trans­parency, but of­fer­ing no in­for­ma­tion about who made the wines.</p>
    <p>We now know that Ava­line’s sparkling wine is made by Raven­tos i Blanc in Cat­alo­nia, an ex­cel­lent pro­ducer. The rose comes from Mas de Cadenet in Provence, and the white from Can Rafols dels Caus in Spain.</p>
    <p>All the wines, the com­pany promises, are made from or­ganic or bio­dy­nam­i­cally grown grapes, are fer­mented with indige­nous yeast and are ap­pro­pri­ate for ve­g­ans, mean­ing the wines have not been clar­i­fied with egg whites or other tra­di­tional, an­i­mal-de­rived prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Other clean wine com­pa­nies are not so trans­par­ent. They speak gen­er­ally about sell­ing wine made by “tra­di­tional meth­ods”. They use terms like Scout & Cel­lar’s trade­marked “clean-crafted”.</p>
    <p>I have urged peo­ple to think of wine as food. If po­lit­i­cal, en­vi­ron­men­tal and eth­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions en­ter your de­ci­sions about which foods to buy, they should in­form your wine-buy­ing as well.</p>
    <p>But let us not ra­tio­nalise wine as health­ful. The rea­son any­body should seek out min­i­mally pro­cessed wine made from con­sci­en­tiously farmed grapes is not be­cause it is health­ier, but be­cause it is bet­ter. It is an aes­thetic choice, not a med­i­cal or “life­style” de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter how a wine is made, it con­tains one in­her­ently dan­ger­ous sub­stance: al­co­hol. Drink­ing too much wine is risky, no mat­ter how it is made.</p>
    <p>Wine is great be­cause it is de­li­cious, en­hances a meal and makes us feel good. It can in­spire cu­rios­ity and study, and the more you learn about it, the deeper the plea­sure in un­der­stand­ing and con­sum­ing it.</p>
    <p>For many peo­ple who just want to know what to buy at the su­per­mar­ket, a brand like Ava­line makes sense. Yet, if you want to drink bet­ter, so many other paths are more promis­ing.</p>
    <p>Try wines di­rectly from pro­duc­ers like Raven­tos i Blanc or Mas de Cadenet. Buy from good wine shops rather than su­per­mar­kets. That is a res­o­lu­tion I can sup­port.</p>
