    <p>To help re­tail­ers trans­form their busi­nesses, more than 550 work­ers from 37 re­tail­ers have been, or are be­ing, trained and re­de­ployed into new or higher-value job roles through Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s Job Re­design Reskilling Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>While some re­tail­ers – in­clud­ing Robin­sons – have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pan­demic and forced to close, oth­ers are look­ing to hire to sup­port their ex­pan­sion plans.</p>
    <p>Home-grown footwear re­tailer Moda Paolo is open­ing two new out­lets in shop­ping malls Jurong Point and Har­bourFront Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh Chong Hoe, who man­ages mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Moda Paolo, said the com­pany is tak­ing ad­van­tage of lower rental at malls as a re­sult of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion. “The rental at malls now is not as high as pre­vi­ously, based on the mar­ket rate. So we feel that right now is a good time for us to ex­pand,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is a gam­ble on our part... (but) we are hop­ing that things will get bet­ter in the next one to two years.”</p>
    <p>To sup­port its ex­pan­sion plans, Moda Paolo is hir­ing re­tail man­agers, branch man­agers, sales as­sis­tants and cus­tomer ser­vice staff.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, lo­cal fash­ion la­bel The Closet Lover will open its fourth out­let this month at Takashimay­a Shop­ping Cen­tre and is look­ing to fill man­age­rial po­si­tions as part of its ex­pan­sion plans.</p>
    <p>Co-founder Brianna Wong said the fash­ion la­bel, which started in 2011 as an on­line shop­ping site, has al­ways had its sights set on ex­pand­ing its re­tail pres­ence. “Sales have been bet­ter than ex­pected, both on­line and re­tail,” she added.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Min­istry of Man­power said that there have been about 2,500 jobs in the re­tail sec­tor on of­fer as stores re­open and more busi­nesses turn to e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­liam Ow, se­nior con­sult­ing man­ager at em­ploy­ment agency Search Per­son­nel, said he has seen an in­crease in re­tail job open­ings since the end of the cir­cuit breaker in early June. “Pre­vi­ously, the re­tail sec­tor was hir­ing mostly Malaysians and Filipinos, and some of them went back to their home coun­tries,” he said. “At the time, com­pa­nies did not see an im­pact be­cause they were asked to close their stores and they moved to do e-com­merce... Now, stores have re­opened and these com­pa­nies are fac­ing a man­power is­sue for front-of-house op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>But em­ploy­ers are not find­ing it easy to fill these po­si­tions as few Sin­ga­pore­ans are keen to work the long hours de­manded in re­tail jobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Ow has also seen more job open­ings for e-com­merce-re­lated roles, as re­tail­ers have been forced to move their op­er­a­tions on­line to keep pace with con­sumer de­mand.</p>
    <p>To help re­tail­ers trans­form their busi­nesses, more than 550 work­ers from 37 re­tail­ers have been, or are be­ing, trained and re­de­ployed into new or higher-value job roles through Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s Job Re­design Reskilling Pro­gramme, which was en­hanced in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Ms Joyce Ann Ong, 34, pre­vi­ously a store man­ager at baby prod­uct re­tailer Mother­care.</p>
    <p>After the re­tailer re­designed and en­hanced her job scope, she is now also a train­ing as­sis­tance man­ager and dig­i­tal nurs­ery ad­viser lead at Mother­care’s store in Paragon mall, and is able to bet­ter as­sist cus­tomers over the phone or vir­tu­ally through video calls. Since the pro­gramme started at Mother­care in April, eight em­ploy­ees from its mar­ket­ing and op­er­a­tions de­part­ments as well as its Sparkle Clean unit, which pro­vides clean­ing of strollers and child car seats, have been re­trained for new job scopes.</p>
    <p>Ms Ong said: “Through this jour­ney, I found new prospects and a new rea­son to trea­sure and love my job more. We just need to take that one step to get out of our com­fort zone and wel­come changes in or­der to grow.”</p>
