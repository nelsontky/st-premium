    <p>Ini­tially planned to take place in Paris, this year’s Unesco in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage meet­ing will in­stead be held on­line from Dec 14 to 19 in view of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Over the six days, all 42 sub­mis­sions this year, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s nom­i­na­tion of its hawker cul­ture, will be de­lib­er­ated over and the re­sults an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that cel­e­bra­tory events could be planned if Sin­ga­pore’s nom­i­na­tion is ul­ti­mately suc­cess­ful, although the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion means plans can­not yet be con­firmed.</p>
    <p>The ex­pert panel report re­leased on Mon­day is an in­te­gral part of the process, with his­tory in­di­cat­ing that those given the nod by the ex­pert panel are likely to be ap­proved by the in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee (IGC) mak­ing the fi­nal de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA), Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB) and Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions, which made the bid, said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that Sin­ga­pore now “stands a good chance”, although the De­cem­ber de­ci­sion could still go wrong for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There is one other plau­si­ble sce­nario: The com­mit­tee may still de­cide to seek ad­di­tional in­for­ma­tion for Sin­ga­pore’s nom­i­na­tion, trig­ger­ing a process where Sin­ga­pore will have to re­view and edit its ap­pli­ca­tion for re-sub­mis­sion in later cy­cles.</p>
    <p>What is un­likely to hap­pen is that the en­tire ap­pli­ca­tion is re­jected, although NEA, NHB and the Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions re­it­er­ated that “the fi­nal de­ci­sion lies with the IGC”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore sub­mit­ted the nom­i­na­tion doc­u­ments to Unesco in March last year, although it an­nounced its in­ten­tion to nom­i­nate hawker cul­ture as early as Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>This was af­ter it held fo­cus group dis­cus­sions with over 140 par­tic­i­pants be­tween April and July 2018 to discuss pos­si­ble nom­i­na­tions for in­scrip­tion on the Unesco list.</p>
    <p>“Hawker cul­ture was con­sis­tently high­lighted as an in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage that best rep­re­sents Sin­ga­pore’s mul­ti­cul­tural her­itage, with hawker cen­tres viewed as im­por­tant com­mu­nity spa­ces,” the agen­cies said.</p>
    <p>“The suc­cess­ful nom­i­na­tion of an el­e­ment from Sin­ga­pore will al­low us to pro­file and share the rich and mul­ti­cul­tural as­pects of our her­itage with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity.”</p>
