    <p>Two res­i­dents of a Sengkang flat were among five peo­ple who ap­peared in a dis­trict court yes­ter­day over an un­law­ful gath­er­ing in May, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Cassie Ong Shi Hong, 32, and Leong Chee Mun, 37, are ac­cused of al­low­ing 16 oth­ers into their home at Block 295C Com­pass­vale Cres­cent from 10pm on May 8 to around 2am the next day.</p>
    <p>An In­ter­net search re­vealed that the pair are not mar­ried to each other and Leong is the sole owner of the flat.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments do not dis­close the na­ture of their re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>The three oth­ers who ap­peared in court yes­ter­day are: Poh Yang Ting, 21; Felisa Chua Jia Xuan, 23; and Priscilia Tan Sze Hui, 31.</p>
    <p>All five were handed two charges un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>Eight oth­ers who are said to have been part of the same gath­er­ing were given sim­i­lar charges on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>They are: Moey Kai Yi, 18; Thant Thaw Kuang, 19; Cavin Liow Jun Rong, 20; Low Wei Hao, 25; Mandy Tan Yi Xing, 26; Kho Zi Ting, 27; and Jack­son Tan Chia Ho and Jas­min Tan Ee Lin, both 30.</p>
    <p>Thant Thaw Kuang is a Myan­mar na­tional while the 12 oth­ers are Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>All of them are ex­pected to plead guilty to their of­fences ex­cept for Leong, whose case has been ad­journed to Aug 13.</p>
    <p>At least four other guests are ex­pected to be charged in court to­day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said in a state­ment on Tues­day that the res­i­dents of the flat in­vited eight men and eight women to their home for a so­cial gath­er­ing on May 8, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>They added: “The au­thor­i­ties will not hes­i­tate to take ac­tion against any­one who does not com­ply with (safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures) or shows bla­tant dis­re­gard for our laws.”</p>
    <p>For each charge un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, a first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. A re­peat of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
