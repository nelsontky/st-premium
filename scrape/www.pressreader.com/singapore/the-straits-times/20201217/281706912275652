    <p>Malaysia’s an­nounce­ment that it is ex­plor­ing travel bub­bles with other coun­tries to re­vive the tourism in­dus­try has drawn cau­tious op­ti­mism from ex­perts, who say the gov­ern­ment first needs to bring down coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, which have re­cently been ris­ing by close to 2,000 new cases daily.</p>
    <p>“We need to work harder to bring the num­ber down to a man­age­able level first. This is to en­sure that the ‘bub­ble’ will not de­flate soon af­ter its im­ple­men­ta­tion,” Pro­fes­sor Sazaly Abu Bakar, di­rec­tor of the Trop­i­cal In­fec­tious Dis­eases Re­search and Ed­u­ca­tion Cen­tre at Univer­siti Malaya, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Awang Bulgiba Awang Mah­mud, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at Univer­siti Malaya, said the fac­tors that must be care­fully con­sid­ered in­clude eco­nomic ben­e­fits, fea­si­bil­ity of such travel bub­bles, health risks and plans to mit­i­gate risks. The num­ber of new cases in the coun­tries con­cerned also had to be taken into ac­count, as well as the num­ber of new daily in­fec­tions per capita, tests per capita, pos­i­tiv­ity rate, sever­ity of in­fec­tion in those coun­tries, and rate of in­crease or de­crease in cases.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia and what­ever coun­try it is ne­go­ti­at­ing with will need to agree on cri­te­ria for a rea­son­ably safe en­vi­ron­ment be­fore such a travel bub­ble can be agreed on,” Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba said.</p>
    <p>“One needs to re­mem­ber that the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion can take a turn for the worse quickly in coun­tries... So such a travel bub­ble needs to take that pos­si­bil­ity into ac­count and take ap­pro­pri­ate mea­sures to ame­lio­rate the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter in charge of Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri last Satur­day said the na­tion’s bor­ders can­not re­main closed for too long and that “Covid-19 will al­ways be around us, like dengue”.</p>
    <p>Malaysia suf­fered a 78.6 per cent drop in tourist ar­rivals be­tween Jan­uary and Septem­ber, against the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Tourism Malaysia, Sin­ga­pore was the coun­try’s top source of tourists last year, with In­done­sia sec­ond, and China third.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the for­eign­ers al­lowed to en­ter the coun­try are mostly spouses or chil­dren of ci­ti­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents, and long-term pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­opened its bor­der with Sin­ga­pore for es­sen­tial travel on Aug 17, but with re­stric­tions. In Au­gust, Sin­ga­pore al­lowed Malaysians with Sin­ga­pore work passes to serve a seven-day stay-home no­tice (SHN) at their own res­i­dence as Covid-19 preva­lence rates in Malaysia were sim­i­lar to Sin­ga­pore’s at the time.</p>
    <p>But from Nov 22, fol­low­ing a spike in Malaysia’s Covid-19 num­bers, any­one en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore with a travel his­tory to Malaysia in the pre­vi­ous 14 days is now re­quired to com­plete a 14-day SHN at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity, and un­dergo a swab test.</p>
    <p>Malaysia, on its part, has short­ened its quar­an­tine pe­riod for in­com­ing trav­ellers to 10 days from 14 days, be­gin­ning on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Tourism, Arts and Cul­ture Min­is­ter Nancy Shukri does not deny that there are hur­dles in the bub­ble plan: “With many coun­tries pre­vi­ously des­ig­nated as green zones hav­ing ex­pe­ri­enced resur­gences of the virus, it re­mains chal­leng­ing to kick-start gen­eral tourism and coun­try-to-coun­try travel,” Datuk Seri Nancy told ST.</p>
    <p>But Malaysia is con­tin­u­ing to pur­sue “ex­ten­sive dis­cus­sions” at re­gional and in­ter­na­tional lev­els “for when the sit­u­a­tion sur­round­ing Covid-19 gets bet­ter and when coun­tries are ready to re­ceive in­ter­na­tional leisure trav­ellers in the fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>The ac­tiv­i­ties the min­istry is ex­plor­ing for vis­i­tors in­clude golf­ing, div­ing, bird watch­ing, hik­ing and cav­ing, with pre-planned itinerarie­s through reg­is­tered travel op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Malaysia recorded 1,295 new cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing to­tal in­fec­tions to 87,913. With seven more fa­tal­i­ties, the death toll stands at 429.</p>
