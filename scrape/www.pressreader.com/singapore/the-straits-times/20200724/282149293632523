    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has raised an ad­di­tional $750 mil­lion from long-term loans se­cured on some of its Air­bus A-350-900 and Boe­ing 787-10 planes, the car­rier said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>SIA has now raised about $11 bil­lion in liq­uid­ity since the start of its 2020-21 fi­nan­cial year in April, as it grap­ples with the i mpact of Covid-19 on the avi­a­tion sec­tor.</p>
    <p>This sum com­prises $8.8 bil­lion from a rights is­sue backed by Te­masek, $1.65 bil­lion from se­cured fi­nanc­ing and more than $500 mil­lion from new com­mit­ted lines of credit as well as a short­term un­se­cured loan from fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>SIA added that all ex­ist­ing com­mit­ted lines of credit that were due to ma­ture this year have been re­newed un­til next year or later.</p>
    <p>This, to­gether with new com­mit­ted lines of credit, en­sures con­tin­ued ac­cess to more than $2.1 bil­lion in liq­uid­ity.</p>
    <p>The air­line also has the op­tion to raise up to $6.2 bil­lion in ad­di­tional manda­tory con­vert­ible bonds in a move that will be sup­ported by Te­masek. This op­tion can be ac­ti­vated un­til July next year.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing this pe­riod of high un­cer­tainty, SIA will con­tinue to ex­plore ad­di­tional means to shore up liq­uid­ity as nec­es­sary,” it said.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have said that the sig­nif­i­cant moves by SIA to raise funds will help it to shore up a fast-de­plet­ing bal­ance sheet and main­tain in­vestor con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also i ntro­duced sev­eral cost-cut­ting mea­sures, such as pay cuts, but it has so far avoided re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has dev­as­tated the avi­a­tion sec­tor world­wide.</p>
    <p>Travel re­stric­tions in­tro­duced to combat the spread of the virus wiped out de­mand for air travel, with the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion not­ing that pas­sen­ger de­mand is not ex­pected to re­turn to pre-cri­sis l evels un­til 2023 or 2024.</p>
    <p>SIA said on Mon­day that progress to­wards a global lift­ing of bor­der con­trols and travel re­stric­tions has been slower than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Low pas­sen­ger traf­fic has left about 140 of the SIA group’s to­tal fleet of about 200 planes grounded.</p>
