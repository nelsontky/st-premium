    <p>Ques­tions on the el­i­gi­bil­ity thresh­olds for com­pa­nies to ben­e­fit from mea­sures in­tro­duced un­der amend­ments to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act and the In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion Act were among points raised by MPs yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the de­bate on both Bills, MPs lauded the ef­forts put in place to help busi­nesses weather the chal­lenges of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Here are some of the key ques­tions.</p>
    <p>1 QUAL­I­FY­ING THRESH­OLDS</p>
    <p>Sev­eral MPs, in­clud­ing Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) and Mr Der­rick Goh (Nee Soon GRC), sug­gested that the thresh­olds should not be set too high so that more en­ti­ties could ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said the use of rev­enue drop to iden­tify busi­nesses af­fected by the Covid-19 cri­sis should not be too con­ser­va­tive for the amend­ments un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act to be help­ful, as oth­er­wise, it would only cover com­pa­nies that are al­ready fac­ing im­mi­nent sol­vency is­sues.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong re­it­er­ated that the Gov­ern­ment’s po­si­tion in de­sign­ing the two Bills is to help the economy for the long term.</p>
    <p>“We want to achieve a fair bal­ance be­tween the busi­ness en­ti­ties and pro­vide a frame­work for them to relook their op­er­at­ing as­sump­tions, look at it in the con­text of what they know to­day about the economy, about the re­stric­tions to busi­nesses, and then make a con­sid­ered de­ci­sion as to what the rene­go­ti­ated terms should look like,” he said, adding that the qual­i­fy­ing thresh­olds would be set in this con­text.</p>
    <p>2 AS­SIS­TANCE FOR FIRMS</p>
    <p>Ms Hany Soh (Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC) asked about the as­sis­tance to firms to help them un­der­stand their op­tions, and ad­vise them on whether and how to utilise the right frame­work or pro­gramme for their needs.</p>
    <p>She said: “While the Re-Align Frame­work and Sim­pli­fied In­sol­vency Pro­gramme are ben­e­fi­cial, we need to raise aware­ness to en­sure that those el­i­gi­ble will know how to ap­ply and are en­cour­aged to do so.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said the Gov­ern­ment has reached out to var­i­ous in­dus­try groups, such as cham­bers, trade or­gan­i­sa­tions and as­so­ci­a­tions in touch with mi­cro and small busi­nesses, to help dis­sem­i­nate in­for­ma­tion pack­ages.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Law has also been ex­plor­ing op­tions with the Law So­ci­ety to set up out­reach for more pro bono lawyers to as­sist par­ties on the ground, as well as law schools which run pro bono cen­tres, he added.</p>
    <p>3 DIFFERENTI­ATED CRI­TE­RIA</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MP Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) and Mr Ed­ward Chia (Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC) sug­gested that more differenti­ated cri­te­ria could be in­sti­tuted for firms to qual­ify for sim­pli­fied in­sol­vency pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim said: “It may be valu­able to con­sider the pos­si­bil­ity of a tiered set of bank­ruptcy rules that ap­ply to mi­cro, small, medium and large en­ter­prises, con­sis­tent with the likely com­plex­ity of the op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Chia asked if other qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria could be pro­vided for dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries to recog­nise the nu­ances be­tween dif­fer­ent sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing, Mr Tong said the qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria would not be fur­ther differenti­ated, as those set out al­ready tar­get the rel­e­vant cases and com­pany sizes, and the ob­jec­tive is to sim­plify over­all pro­cesses rather than over-com­pli­cate the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>4 PRO­TECT­ING OTHER STAKE­HOLD­ERS</p>
    <p>Labour MP Pa­trick Tay (Pi­o­neer) raised con­cerns over how other stake­hold­ers, such as em­ploy­ees and ven­dors, would be cov­ered in sit­u­a­tions where busi­nesses un­dergo sim­pli­fied debt re­struc­tur­ing or liq­ui­da­tion.</p>
    <p>He also called for more di­rect as­sis­tance to sup­port work­ers who seek to re­cover their un­paid wages, by sim­pli­fy­ing and ex­pe­dit­ing en­force­ment of re­cov­ery pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>“In any event, there is lit­tle or no re­course for both work­ers and unions as a mora­to­rium of sorts pro­hibits the en­force­ment of rights un­der a col­lec­tive agree­ment or any other due process,” he said.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Tong ex­plained that the pro­vi­sions un­der the In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion Act are not in­tended to af­fect the ex­ist­ing prin­ci­ples that ap­ply to schemes of ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to a sit­u­a­tion where a com­pany is un­der­go­ing liq­ui­da­tion, he noted that pri­or­ity in pay­ing off debts is given in a de­scend­ing or­der, with the ex­penses of liq­ui­da­tion and the ap­pli­cant for wind­ing up the com­pany com­ing fore­most.</p>
    <p>These have pri­or­ity over em­ploy­ees’ claims, which are paid there­after, Mr Tong said.</p>
