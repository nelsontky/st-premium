    <p>LIS­BON • Uefa pres­i­dent Alek­sander Ce­ferin says the sin­glegame knock­out for­mat, used in the Cham­pi­ons League this year from the quar­ter-fi­nals on­wards, has pro­duced more ex­cit­ing foot­ball than the usual two-legged games and could be re­vis­ited in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The for­mat was changed in or­der to al­low the com­pe­ti­tion to be com­pleted in a shorter time span af­ter the Covid-19 pan­demic halted play in Euro­pean leagues from March.</p>
    <p>The “Fi­nal Eight” clubs have been based in Lis­bon for the past two weeks, cul­mi­nat­ing in yes­ter­day’s fi­nal be­tween Bayern Munich and</p>
    <p>Paris Saint-Ger­main and Ce­ferin be­lieves the re­for­mat­ted com­pe­ti­tion has been a suc­cess, de­spite be­ing played be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>With­out a sec­ond leg and away goals to fall back on, teams have been forced to go for it and that has res­onated with fans watch­ing from home.</p>
    <p>“We were forced to do it but in the end, we see that we found out some­thing new. So we will think about it in the fu­ture for sure,” he told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“(There has been) not so much tac­tics. If it is one match, if one team scores then the other has to score as soon as pos­si­ble. If it is two-legged sys­tem, then there is still time to win the next match.</p>
    <p>“More ex­cit­ing matches for sure, but of course, we also have to think about the fact that we have less matches and broad­cast­ers (can) say, ‘You don’t have as many matches as be­fore, this is dif­fer­ent’, so we will have to dis­cuss when this crazy sit­u­a­tion ends.”</p>
    <p>The cur­rent for­mat is locked in place con­trac­tu­ally un­til the 2024-25 sea­son, but dis­cus­sions are due to begin later this year on the struc­ture for the com­pe­ti­tion for the next phase.</p>
    <p>Clear­ing space in the con­gested in­ter­na­tional cal­en­dar will be an­other ob­sta­cle to over­come amid the pan­demic, but Ce­ferin is clearly in­trigued by the pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Look, for sure it is a very in­ter­est­ing for­mat. Now, I doubt as much as the cal­en­dar is now, that we could do a ‘Fi­nal Eight’ (tour­na­ment), be­cause it would take too much time,” the Slove­nian added. “But a for­mat with one match and a sys­tem like it is now, I think it would be much more ex­cit­ing than the for­mat that was be­fore.</p>
    <p>“If we would play this sys­tem then, but we haven’t dis­cussed with any­one, its just an idea, we would play in one city. If you play in one city, you can have a week of foot­ball or some­thing like that. But it is far too early to think about it.</p>
    <p>“We have seen it as a big suc­cess and the view­er­ship over TV has been huge, maybe it also good be­cause it is Au­gust and peo­ple are at home, some of them at least, but in­ter­est­ing, in­ter­est­ing tour­na­ment.”</p>
    <p>NO SEC­OND CHANCE</p>
    <p>There has been not so much tac­tics. If it is one match, if one team scores then the other has to score as soon as pos­si­ble. If it is two-legged sys­tem, then there is still time to win the next match. More ex­cit­ing matches for sure. ’’</p>
