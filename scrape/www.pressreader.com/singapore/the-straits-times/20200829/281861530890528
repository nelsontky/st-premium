    <p>• Sev­eral large US states are not heed­ing fed­eral health of­fi­cials’ calls to re­duce Covid-19 test­ing of some peo­ple ex­posed to the virus, j oin­ing a broad re­buke of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion by pub­lic health lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Ari­zona, Cal­i­for­nia, Con­necti­cut, Florida, Illi­nois, Texas, New Jer­sey and New York all plan to con­tinue to test asymp­to­matic peo­ple who have been ex­posed to Covid-19, de­spite new guid­ance from the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) sug­gest­ing that such tests may not be needed.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for t he Texas Depart­ment of State Health Ser­vices said: “The cur­rent Texas guid­ance rec­om­mends test­ing for all close con­tacts of a con­firmed case be­cause it al­lows for early case iden­ti­fi­ca­tion among peo­ple who are at a higher risk of in­fec­tion. There’s not a planned change at this point.”</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia and New York made sim­i­lar state­ments. The Florida Depart­ment of Health said asymp­to­matic test­ing was con­tin­u­ing while the new CDC rec­om­men­da­tions were eval­u­ated, and Texas also said it would eval­u­ate.</p>
    <p>The CDC said this week that peo­ple ex­posed to Covid-19 but not symp­to­matic may not need to be tested, shock­ing doc­tors and politi­cians and prompt­ing ac­cu­sa­tions the guid­ance was po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the CDC guid­ance, test­ing in the United States had dropped. The coun­try tested on av­er­age 675,000 peo­ple a day last week, down from a peak last month of more than 800,000 peo­ple a day.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­ally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row, but in­fec­tions are surg­ing again in the US Mid­west, with four states re­port­ing record one-day spikes in cases on Thurs­day as the US death toll climbed above 180,000.</p>
    <p>The CDC had pre­vi­ously rec­om­mended test­ing of all peo­ple who had close con­tact with some­one who was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo said the state of New York would not be abid­ing by the new guid­ance and chal­lenged the as­ser­tion that pol­i­tics played no role in the change.</p>
    <p>Ad­mi­ral Brett Giroir, as­sis­tant sec­re­tary for health at the Depart­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices, said there was no po­lit­i­cal pres­sure from the ad­min­is­tra­tion. He said test­ing asymp­to­matic pa­tients too early could pro­duce false neg­a­tives and con­trib­ute to the virus’ spread.</p>
    <p>CNN and The New York Times re­ported on Wed­nes­day that US pub­lic health of­fi­cials were or­dered by high-level mem­bers of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to push for­ward with the changes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, many na­tions ad­vo­cate early test­ing. The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) on Thurs­day said that re­sources per­mit­ting, peo­ple ex­posed to the coro­n­avirus should be tested even if they do not show immediate symp­toms of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emer­gen­cies pro­gramme, said there was a ra­tio­nale for test­ing asymp­to­matic or pre-symp­to­matic peo­ple, in par­tic­u­lar where clus­ters of in­fec­tions were emerg­ing, but that broad pop­u­la­tion test­ing was costly and un­re­al­is­tic.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean gov­ern­ments have used broad test­ing and iso­la­tion to con­trol the virus. France, for in­stance, rec­om­mends that any­one who thinks he or she needs a test should get one, and in Ger­many, peo­ple with close con­tact of 15 min­utes or more with a per­son with Covid-19 are ad­vised to have a test.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, WHO di­rec­tor­gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said an in­ter­na­tional mis­sion the agency is or­gan­is­ing to travel to China to in­ves­ti­gate the virus’ ori­gin would go to Wuhan, where the first in­fec­tions were de­tected late last year.</p>
