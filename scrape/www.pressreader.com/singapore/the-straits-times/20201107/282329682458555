    <p>Se­nior fi­nance ex­ec­u­tive Phillip Ang’s heart sinks each time he has to use his mo­bile phone to scan QR codes for con­tact trac­ing be­fore en­ter­ing public places.</p>
    <p>A spinal mus­cu­lar at­ro­phy con­di­tion pre­vents Mr Ang, 55, from mov­ing his hands much, and the QR codes are “al­ways too high”, so he has to ask for help.</p>
    <p>An­other per­son who faces sim­i­lar prob­lems is part-time Grab­Food de­liv­ery part­ner Juni Syafiqah Ju­mat, who has cere­bral palsy.</p>
    <p>To get past the scan­ning of QR codes, Ms Syafiqah, 25, uses the dig­i­tal bar­code in the TraceTo­gether app and shows that to mall staff, but this does not al­ways work.</p>
    <p>She said: “Some places don’t have bar­code scan­ners, so I need to ask some­one to help me scan.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and their care­givers told In­sight that while tech­no­log­i­cal con­ve­niences have made life eas­ier, gaps re­main in mak­ing such tech ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Those with cog­ni­tive dis­abil­i­ties, for in­stance, may face chal­lenges tog­gling from one app to an­other, said Mr Mark Lim, who heads The So­cial Fac­tor, a con­sul­tancy that con­ducts spe­cial needs train­ing for ed­u­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>The self-worth of in­di­vid­u­als with dis­abil­i­ties may be af­fected when they see oth­ers eas­ily ac­com­plish­ing tasks like scan­ning QR codes in public spa­ces while they strug­gle to do the same, he said.</p>
    <p>This sen­ti­ment is echoed by Mr Ang, who said he feels the pres­sure of quickly tap­ping his ez-link card on buses, de­spite the task be­ing dif­fi­cult for him.</p>
    <p>But like all the peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties In­sight spoke to, Mr Ang is aware that tech­nol­ogy sig­nif­i­cantly con­trib­utes to his life.</p>
    <p>In his case, spe­cial ac­ces­sories such as mo­torised wheel­chairs and a track­ball mouse – which al­lows users to move their cur­sors with only their thumbs – help him to get around and do his job.</p>
    <p>“There has been more aware­ness of the need for ac­ces­si­bil­ity, par­tic­u­larly for the in­clu­sion of per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore,” said Ms Joyce Wong, di­rec­tor of cen­tralised ser­vices at lo­cal dis­abil­ity-fo­cused charity SPD. “We see that in the cap­tion­ing of news bul­letins on tele­vi­sion, talk­ing ATMs and ac­ces­si­bil­ity fea­tures on mo­bile phones and tablets.”</p>
    <p>Auto-gen­er­at­ing cap­tion tech­nol­ogy has made things much eas­ier for Mr Sean Poh, who is hear­ing-im­paired. The 27-year-old, who works in public re­la­tions, said he uses it dur­ing all his work meet­ings, but it is not per­fect as some­times cap­tions are not cap­tured when peo­ple speak too fast or when too many peo­ple talk at once.</p>
    <p>Also highly use­ful is text-to-speech tech­nol­ogy, which reads out words on screen to help visu­ally im­paired peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Den­nis Teo, 59, who used to work in in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, be­came al­most com­pletely blind six years ago. He re­mem­bers how hard life was when text-tospeech tech­nol­ogy was al­most non-ex­is­tent. But it has pro­gressed so quickly that it helps him to use his smart­phone well, do­ing things like get­ting news and or­gan­is­ing his mu­sic.</p>
    <p>“This fea­ture, five or six years ago, was not com­pre­hen­sive, al­most non-ex­is­tent. For blind peo­ple, we couldn’t do any­thing with­out it – but it’s now ev­ery­where,” said Mr Teo, who is a ben­e­fi­ciary of the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of the Visu­ally Hand­i­capped (SAVH).</p>
    <p>But even with these im­prove­ments, the quick pace of tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ments risks leav­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties be­hind.</p>
    <p>Some told In­sight they still find it dif­fi­cult to ac­cess es­sen­tial ser­vices like bank­ing, as many dig­i­tal ap­pli­ca­tions and ser­vices are still be­ing de­vel­oped with­out con­sid­er­ing their needs.</p>
    <p>“Re­view­ing of a so­lu­tion or de­vice’s ac­ces­si­bil­ity is also often done af­ter they have been rolled out, and with lim­ited con­sul­ta­tion with per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties,” said Ms Wong.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Lim Sun Sun, head of hu­man­i­ties, arts and so­cial sci­ences at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign, and who con­ducts re­search on dig­i­tal in­clu­sion, high­lighted the need for in­clu­sion by de­sign in dig­i­tal solutions, where the needs of ev­ery group of so­ci­ety, in­clud­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, are con­sid­ered in the plan­ning stages.</p>
    <p>Church worker Ng Choon Hwee, 65, who is visu­ally im­paired and a ben­e­fi­ciary of SAVH, noted that while the public may still need to step in to help them at times, peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties want to try to be as in­de­pen­dent as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, said Mr Teo, while apps ex­ist to in­form those who can­not see when their buses are ar­riv­ing, what if two buses ar­rive at the same time? When this hap­pens, he is forced to ask for help. Most peo­ple in his sit­u­a­tion do, but Mr Teo said he was ini­tially frus­trated at hav­ing to do so.</p>
    <p>“Some bus cap­tains and peo­ple are nice – when you ask them, some will an­swer. But some don’t – some might turn their heads or nod – but I can’t see that be­cause I am blind!” he said.</p>
    <p>Dan­gers on­line such as cy­ber bul­ly­ing, hack­ing and phish­ing scams pose an even big­ger threat to peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, said Ms Estella Mah, chair­man of the in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy com­mit­tee at the As­so­ci­a­tion for Per­sons with Spe­cial Needs.</p>
    <p>But un­der­grad­u­ate Jonathan Tiong, 23, who has spinal mus­cu­lar at­ro­phy, said his poor mo­tor skills make it dif­fi­cult for him to use twofac­tor au­then­ti­ca­tion fea­tures even though they guard against cy­ber­crime.</p>
    <p>He has to rely on his par­ents to re­trieve his phone for the one-time pass­word when he logs in to apps or ser­vices, and this in­con­ve­niences them. If they are not around, he will not be able to log in.</p>
    <p>But on the plus side, he is able to type on a com­puter with the help of as­sis­tive tech­nol­ogy, which al­lows him to use a mouse to se­lect let­ters from a vir­tual key­board dis­played on a screen in­stead of typ­ing with his fin­gers.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Tiong: “The bot­tom line is, per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties don’t re­ally need new­fan­gled gad­gets or spe­cially de­signed apps or some dif­fer­ent kind of tech from nor­mal peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“We just need some mi­nor ad­just­ments and adap­ta­tions to the ex­ist­ing tech to ad­dress some pain points that are unique to us due to the lim­i­ta­tions brought about by our dis­abil­i­ties.”</p>
