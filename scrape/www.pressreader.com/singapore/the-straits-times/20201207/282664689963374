    <p>Play is not a waste of time for kids – so­cial en­tre­pre­neur Su­mi­tra Pa­su­pa­thy never tires of shar­ing this piece of par­ent­ing ad­vice.</p>
    <p>In fact, the Cam­bridge-ed­u­cated chem­i­cal en­gi­neer be­lieves so strongly in it, she co-founded Playeum in 2008 to ad­vo­cate for more play among chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the non­profit group holds ac­tiv­i­ties for kids to en­cour­age hands-on ex­plo­ration.</p>
    <p>She says it is com­mon for par­ents to think that “play­time should not be pri­ori­tised in their child’s day un­less some­thing else gets done first”.</p>
    <p>More of­ten than not, this means do­ing as­sess­ment books and go­ing for tu­ition classes.</p>
    <p>“Play is just as im­por­tant as any other task. It’s a time where they learn,” says the 48-year-old mum of three boys aged nine, 14 and 16.</p>
    <p>When kids are play­ing, they are tak­ing creative risks and solv­ing prob­lems. If they are in groups, they also learn to de­velop em­pa­thy and work in teams.</p>
    <p>These skills and qual­i­ties have be­come all the more im­por­tant, even for adults, in to­day’s rapidly chang­ing world.</p>
    <p>“It’s no longer ‘What was your maths score?’, but ‘Can you re­spond to change? Are you solv­ing prob­lems?’” she says.</p>
    <p>She adds that some tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies are em­brac­ing play­ful­ness too, with foos­ball ta­bles in fun workspaces.</p>
    <p>“We, as adults, need to be more play­ful too. I have to re­mind my­self about that all the time be­cause I get so busy with work,” she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“Play is a won­der­ful way to con­nect with your kids when you’re play­ing to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Give your chil­dren open-ended play op­por­tu­ni­ties and let them take own­er­ship of the ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, she sug­gests giv­ing them Lego bricks to cre­ate de­signs from their imag­i­na­tion, in­stead of build­ing a struc­ture ac­cord­ing to the in­struc­tion book­let.</p>
    <p>You can also give them card­board boxes, toi­let pa­per rolls, bot­tle caps and other re­cy­clable ev­ery­day items. With some colour­ing and cre­ativ­ity, these can trans­form into a man, a whale or a Christ­mas tree.</p>
    <p>Kids are spend­ing more time play­ing, but on dig­i­tal de­vices and at an ear­lier age, she ac­knowl­edges.</p>
    <p>Be­sides mak­ing screen-time agree­ments with their sons, she and her hus­band try to model good prac­tices, such as no phones at the din­ner ta­ble and in bed­rooms.</p>
    <p>“Your phone should not be the first thing you look at when you wake up,” she says, adding con­cerns about ad­dic­tion and cy­ber bul­ly­ing. “We need to help our chil­dren make the right choices for their well­be­ing.”</p>
    <p>But there is no need to over­plan for them dur­ing the school hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“Give your chil­dren time to be bored, to tin­ker, to day­dream and to do things that may not al­ways be pro­duc­tive, but could be very creative,” says Ms Pa­su­pa­thy.</p>
