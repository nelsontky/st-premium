    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Peo­ple in Ja­pan and South Korea have mixed views of the United States but gen­er­ally neg­a­tive views of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>As in other coun­tries sur­veyed by Pew Re­search for its new re­port on in­ter­na­tional per­cep­tion of the US and its Pres­i­dent, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus ap­pears to have dam­aged the US’ im­age.</p>
    <p>In South Korea, 93 per cent think the US did a bad job in man­ag­ing the pan­demic. In Ja­pan, the fig­ure is 79 per cent. Mr Trump en­joys his high­est rat­ing in Ja­pan, but only a quar­ter of Ja­panese polled ex­pressed a pos­i­tive view of him.</p>
    <p>A higher 41 per cent of Ja­panese still have a pos­i­tive view of the US, though that is also down sharply from 68 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Favourable views of the US in South Korea have been in steep de­cline since last year, yet it is the only coun­try sur­veyed where a ma­jor­ity still holds a pos­i­tive opin­ion.</p>
    <p>But trust in Pres­i­dent Trump has dropped from 2018 when his pol­icy to­wards North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un – amid the Sin­ga­pore sum­mit held in June that year – earned him sup­port in the south.</p>
    <p>“South Kore­ans’ confidence in Trump more than dou­bled from 2017 to 2018 and re­mained at that level in 2019,” Pew said. “That year, 78 per cent of Kore­ans ap­proved of Trump’s pol­icy to ne­go­ti­ate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un about the coun­try’s nu­clear weapons.</p>
    <p>“Current rat­ings are back to their 2017 low: Only 17 per cent be­lieve Trump would do the right thing re­gard­ing world af­fairs.”</p>
    <p>But South Kore­ans sep­a­rate their view of Mr Trump from their view of the US. South Korea “stands out as the only coun­try sur­veyed where a ma­jor­ity (59 per cent) views the US pos­i­tively”, Pew found.</p>
    <p>While China is the most com­mon choice as a global eco­nomic leader in nearly ev­ery other coun­try sur­veyed, a ma­jor­ity of 77 per cent in South Korea be­lieve the US holds that spot.</p>
    <p>With Euro­pean coun­tries sur­veyed, “peo­ple who place them­selves on the right of the ide­o­log­i­cal spec­trum in gen­eral have a more pos­i­tive view of the US than peo­ple on the ide­o­log­i­cal left”, Pew Re­search found. “This ide­o­log­i­cal di­vide is par­tic­u­larly large in Spain and South Korea,” Pew said.</p>
