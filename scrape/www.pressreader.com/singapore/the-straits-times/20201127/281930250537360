    <p>Un­speak­able dan­gers lurk every­where. A new class of Covid-19 vac­cines will turn hu­mans into mon­keys. The land­scape is stud­ded with 5G masts that trans­mit coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept that mon­key-gen­er­at­ing vac­cines and virus-spread­ing telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions in­fra­struc­ture do not ex­ist (un­less an in­fected per­son touches or coughs on a 5G mast, leav­ing traces of virus for oth­ers to pick up).</p>
    <p>The real threat comes from these con­spir­a­to­rial fic­tions pol­lut­ing the “in­fo­s­phere”, the on­line in­for­ma­tion en­vi­ron­ment to which a per­son is ex­posed daily.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers at the Ox­ford In­ter­net In­sti­tute sug­gest that the in­fo­s­phere should be con­sid­ered a so­cial de­ter­mi­nant of health, along­side fac­tors such as ed­u­ca­tion, in­come and hous­ing.</p>
    <p>Clas­si­fy­ing it this way, Ms Jes­sica Mor­ley and Pro­fes­sor Lu­ciano Floridi write in Pub­lic Health Post, “recog­nises a di­rect cor­re­la­tion be­tween ex­po­sure to poor in­for­ma­tion qual­ity and poor health out­comes”.</p>
    <p>CELEBRITY SU­PER SPREAD­ERS</p>
    <p>Mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion, Ms Mor­ley ex­plains, is pack­aged for on­line con­sump­tion in mul­ti­ple guises: in search re­sults, sup­port groups pro­mot­ing harm­ful be­hav­iours such as anorexia, con­spir­acy the­o­ries such as anti-vax ma­te­rial that pop up on so­cial me­dia, un­reg­u­lated health apps, and fad di­ets served up by celebrity “su­per spread­ers” to In­sta­gram fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Trou­bling ideas spread like dan­de­lion clocks in the dig­i­tal wind, ex­ert­ing enough in­flu­ence on in­di­vid­u­als to sway health de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Some­times, as demon­strated by the Vac­cine Con­fi­dence Project at the London School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine, mis­in­for­ma­tion and dis­in­for­ma­tion (MDI) can move the dial in the wrong di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers asked 8,000 peo­ple in Bri­tain and the United States if they would “def­i­nitely” have a Covid-19 vac­cine. About 54 per cent in Bri­tain, and 41 per cent in the US, said yes.</p>
    <p>Some of the same re­spon­dents were then shown an ar­ray of MDI, in­clud­ing tweets from celebrity ac­counts as­sert­ing that Covid-19 vac­cines cause in­fer­til­ity. When sur­veyed af­ter view­ing it, will­ing­ness dropped by about 6 per­cent­age points in Bri­tain and two in the US.</p>
    <p>Given that, ac­cord­ing to some es­ti­mates, at least 55 per cent of peo­ple must be vac­ci­nated to reach herd im­mu­nity, mis­in­for­ma­tion could tip the bal­ance on how smoothly the world ex­its the coronaviru­s cri­sis. It is a global is­sue: France and Rus­sia also score poorly on vac­cine con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple dif­fer in their abil­ity to judge the ac­cu­racy and trust­wor­thi­ness of on­line in­for­ma­tion, a ca­pac­ity known as e-health lit­er­acy (partly in­flu­enced by ed­u­ca­tion level).</p>
    <p>Mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion... is pack­aged for on­line con­sump­tion in mul­ti­ple guises: in search re­sults, sup­port groups pro­mot­ing harm­ful be­hav­iours such as anorexia, con­spir­acy the­o­ries such as anti-vax ma­te­rial that pop up on so­cial me­dia, un­reg­u­lated health apps, and fad di­ets served up by celebrity “su­per spread­ers” to In­sta­gram fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>POOR E-HEALTH LIT­ER­ACY</p>
    <p>Ms Mor­ley, a for­mer tech­nol­ogy ad­viser to the UK’s health de­part­ment, the­o­rises that a phe­nom­e­non seen in on­line po­lit­i­cal mes­sag­ing might ap­ply here. “Peo­ple with lower lev­els of e-health lit­er­acy might look for sim­pler in­di­ca­tors of what to trust, such as ‘likes’,” she says.</p>
    <p>“We know it hap­pens in other do­mains: Po­lit­i­cal in­for­ma­tion that gets more likes tends to be re­garded as more trust­wor­thy.”</p>
    <p>The Ox­ford re­searchers have had in­for­mal con­ver­sa­tions with the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The agency has it­self warned of a global “infodemic”, de­fined as an over­abun­dance of both on­line and off­line in­for­ma­tion which “in­cludes de­lib­er­ate at­tempts to dis­sem­i­nate wrong in­for­ma­tion to un­der­mine the pub­lic health re­sponse and ad­vance al­ter­na­tive agen­das of groups and in­di­vid­u­als”.</p>
    <p>For­mally recog­nis­ing the in­fo­s­phere could jus­tify on­line in­ter­ven­tion to pro­tect pub­lic health. For ex­am­ple, the much-de­layed on­line harms Bill in Bri­tain, which tar­gets se­ri­ous ac­tiv­ity such as ex­trem­ism and child sex­ual ex­ploita­tion, could con­sider a wider range of health harms from MDI, Ms Mor­ley thinks.</p>
    <p>She ac­knowl­edges, though, that tack­ling out­landish ideas should not spill over into cen­sor­ing le­git­i­mate schol­arly dis­agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The Ox­ford re­searchers want to gauge pub­lic ap­petite for in­ter­ven­tion on­line – and talk to pol­i­cy­mak­ers about how to fur­ther pub­lic health goals with­out un­rea­son­ably curb­ing free­dom of ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>It was no­table that, in the run-up to the US elec­tion, com­men­ta­tors seemed quicker to call out po­lit­i­cal MDI in the name of sav­ing democ­racy.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis is forc­ing a sim­i­lar re­cal­cu­la­tion of whether free on­line ex­pres­sion, when in­voked to spread dis­tor­tions and false­hoods, car­ries an un­rea­son­able cost to pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish con­spir­acy the­o­rist</p>
    <p>David Icke, whose un­founded tweet about Covid-19 vac­cines caus­ing mass in­fer­til­ity fea­tures in the Vac­cine Con­fi­dence Project, has now been banned from Face­book, YouTube and Twit­ter. That his para­noid out­pour­ings are now fall­ing on ster­ile ground feels al­most karmic.</p>
