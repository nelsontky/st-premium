    <p>Since Ac­tiveSG sports fa­cil­i­ties re­opened on June 19, Ac­tiveSG has seen about 1,000 cases of peo­ple flout­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of such breaches in­clude in­ter­mix­ing of play­ers from dif­fer­ent courts or book­ing of time slots at fa­cil­i­ties un­der some­one else’s name.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiveSG chief Sng Hock Lin said at Heart­beat@Be­dok yes­ter­day: “All the mea­sures are new, not just to the pub­lic but to (na­tional agency) Sport Sin­ga­pore. Nat­u­rally, peo­ple will take time to ad­just to the new mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>While most of these breaches re­sulted in warn­ings or re­minders, a few have been sus­pended from Ac­tiveSG fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>One such ex­am­ple was the or­gan­iser of a so­cial bad­minton group. He brought to­gether 29 peo­ple – in­clud­ing a Covid-19 pa­tient – to play at Jurong East In­door Sport Hall on</p>
    <p>June 22, but did not en­sure they fol­lowed safe dis­tanc­ing rules and in­ter­min­gled. The or­gan­iser’s mem­ber­ship has been sus­pended and in­ves­ti­ga­tions over the in­ci­dent are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>“SportSG takes a se­ri­ous view on peo­ple who vi­o­late our safety man­age­ment mea­sures be­cause it com­pro­mises our whole na­tional ef­fort to pre­vent the risk of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion or, worse, cre­ate an­other clus­ter,” said Sng.</p>
    <p>“I hope that Ac­tiveSG and ev­ery­one else can learn from this and un­der­stand why we need to com­ply with these mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases of rules be­ing bro­ken was about 30 daily in the first few weeks and has dropped to sin­gle dig­its in the past week, he added.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiveSG has also ad­justed some mea­sures, ac­cord­ing to the util­i­sa­tion rates of its fa­cil­i­ties and based on feed­back from users and its staff.</p>
    <p>Since Thurs­day, more slots have been re­leased for those who wish to swim in pub­lic pools. They are al­lowed ac­cess from 9am to noon on week­days, in ad­di­tion to the pre­vi­ous al­lot­ted evening tim­ings at the 20 Ac­tiveSG swim­ming com­plexes in op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Lap swim­ming for se­niors will re­main from 6.30am to 8.45am.</p>
    <p>Sng said: “We want to build con­fi­dence in our mea­sures, then we can open up our fa­cil­i­ties to more peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>But sports fa­cil­i­ties are still op­er­at­ing un­der strict phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Users are re­quired to book spe­cific time slots on the Ac­tiveSG website, with the ex­cep­tion of sta­di­ums, while the op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity is re­stricted to 10 sq m per per­son, or a max­i­mum of 50 peo­ple per fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>All sports and recre­ation venues must also im­ple­ment SafeEn­try for par­tic­i­pants and vis­i­tors. Tem­per­a­ture screen­ing is also manda­tory while em­ploy­ees and vis­i­tors are en­cour­aged to use the TraceTo­gether app.</p>
    <p>PA­TIENCE NEEDED</p>
    <p>All the mea­sures are new, not just to the pub­lic but to Sport Sin­ga­pore. Nat­u­rally, peo­ple will take time to ad­just to the new mea­sures.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>SNG HOCK LIN, Ac­tiveSG chief, on peo­ple re­quir­ing time to ad­just to the new man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>These ar­range­ments have meant sports fa­cil­i­ties are not op­er­at­ing at full ca­pac­ity – util­i­sa­tion rate at pools and bad­minton courts are 90 per cent and 88 per cent re­spec­tively – and se­cur­ing a time slot has be­come harder for users.</p>
    <p>Tee Wooi Seong, 52, used to play bad­minton with his fam­ily once a week at the Heart­beat@Be­dok Sports Hall be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, but has found it dif­fi­cult to book the courts now.</p>
    <p>He said: “We un­der­stand be­cause the num­ber of courts have been re­duced, so I’m not com­plain­ing about it. We just have to keep try­ing.”</p>
