    <p>Ma­jor Malaysian hos­pi­tals are fac­ing coro­n­avirus out­breaks among their staff as the num­ber of ac­tive Covid-19 cases hit more than 15,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Klang gen­eral hos­pi­tal and Ser­dang Hos­pi­tal, in the coun­try’s rich­est and most pop­u­lated state of Se­lan­gor, have suf­fered an out­break among staff in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The Klang gen­eral hos­pi­tal has seen over 50 staff in­fected with the virus, while Ser­dang Hos­pi­tal has reg­is­tered 29 cases.</p>
    <p>Sun­gai Bu­loh Hos­pi­tal, an­other key fa­cil­ity treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients, re­ported 15 cases among its work­ers. Kuala Lumpur Hos­pi­tal has reg­is­tered 10 cases, ac­cord­ing to the Health Min­istry yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tals serve a densely pop­u­lated ur­ban area to­talling over seven mil­lion peo­ple, en­com­pass­ing Kuala Lumpur and Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>The min­istry con­firmed yes­ter­day that 1,359 coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions have been reg­is­tered among health­care work­ers since the third wave be­gan in late Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, it re­ported 43 in­fec­tions among health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>An­other 1,697 health­care work­ers are un­der home sur­veil­lance or­der, which puts them on home quar­an­tine for at least 10 days.</p>
    <p>“This dras­tic spike is be­lieved to be closely linked to the in­crease in com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion. How­ever, the cases in all the hos­pi­tals in­volved are still un­der con­trol and health ser­vices are be­ing pro­vided as usual,” the min­istry said in its daily coro­n­avirus up­date.</p>
    <p>It also said a ma­jor­ity of the health­care work­ers picked up the in­fec­tion through com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion and from other health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, 23 per cent of all re­ported in­fec­tions in­volv­ing health­care work­ers are still un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>This comes as Malaysia’s to­tal ac­tive cases hit an all-time high.</p>
    <p>The coun­try recorded 1,683 new cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of ac­tive cases to 15,140.</p>
    <p>The Klang Val­ley ar­eas of Se­lan­gor and Kuala Lumpur, where the hos­pi­tals are lo­cated, recorded 889 new cases yes­ter­day, more than half the na­tional to­tal.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s to­tal num­ber of cases crossed the 90,000 mark yes­ter­day. It has over­taken China, where the coro­n­avirus out­break was first re­ported about a year ago. The to­tal in Malaysia stands at 90,816.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment also an­nounced yes­ter­day that it was ex­tend­ing the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der re­stric­tions for Klang Val­ley and the state of Sabah to Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Both ar­eas had been un­der par­tial lock­downs since Oct 14.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the govern­ment lifted travel re­stric­tions, ef­fec­tively al­low­ing free move­ment, but some re­stric­tions on the so­cial sec­tor and events re­main.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has so far recorded 432 deaths from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>No new deaths were recorded yes­ter­day. There are 106 peo­ple re­ceiv­ing treat­ment in in­ten­sive care units, with around half of them in need of breath­ing as­sis­tance, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>On Tuesday, a nurse from the Univer­siti Sains Malaysia Hos­pi­tal in Ke­lan­tan died from coro­n­avirus-re­lated com­pli­ca­tions, be­com­ing the lat­est front-line ca­su­alty.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also re­vealed yes­ter­day that nurses make up the largest group of health­care work­ers to be in­fected with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 690 nurses have been in­fected so far, along with 211 med­i­cal of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>This dras­tic spike is be­lieved to be closely linked to the in­crease in com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion. How­ever, the cases in all the hos­pi­tals in­volved are still un­der con­trol and health ser­vices are be­ing pro­vided as usual.</p>
