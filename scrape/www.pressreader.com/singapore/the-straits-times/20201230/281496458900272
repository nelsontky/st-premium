    <p>Lo­cal dance troupe Dance Spec­trum In­ter­na­tional (DSI), which was slated to per­form a tap dance seg­ment at Chin­gay 2021, has de­cided not to par­tic­i­pate in the an­nual pa­rade held as part of Chi­nese New Year cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>This was an­nounced on PAs­sion Chin­gay Club’s Face­book page on Mon­day, after DSI’s seg­ment drew crit­i­cism from ne­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>In a video of DSI’s prepa­ra­tion for the pa­rade shared by Chi­ne­se­lan­guage daily Lianhe Zaobao on Dec 11, the dancers could be seen wear­ing tu­tus un­der their lion dance cos­tumes.</p>
    <p>A pe­ti­tion ask­ing for the tap dance seg­ment to be dropped from Chin­gay 2021 gar­nered over 1,200 sig­na­tures, with sev­eral peo­ple crit­i­cis­ing the per­for­mance for be­ing in­ap­pro­pri­ate and dis­re­spect­ful of tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>DSI’s posts on its Face­book page pub­li­cis­ing the Zaobao ar­ti­cle as well as a Straits Times ar­ti­cle also drew com­ments from un­happy ne­ti­zens, with some call­ing the per­for­mance an in­sult to lion dance cul­ture. Some said it was “non­sense”, and one ne­ti­zen even called for the dance troupe to be shut down.</p>
    <p>Ten dancers from DSI, aged be­tween 14 and 30, were slated to per­form the tap dance rou­tine – one of six seg­ments at the pa­rade, which will be held vir­tu­ally for the first time.</p>
    <p>Chore­ographed by DSI founder and di­rec­tor Sharon Liew, the rou­tine was a com­bi­na­tion of tap dance and lion dance, and would have lasted 15 to 20 sec­onds as part of a four-minute per­for­mance called “100 Lions” at the pa­rade.</p>
    <p>DSI’s with­drawal from Chin­gay “is in con­sid­er­a­tion of the young dancers af­fected by cy­ber bul­ly­ing”, the troupe said in a joint state­ment on Mon­day with the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion (PA) and the Sin­ga­pore Wushu Dragon & Lion Dance Fed­er­a­tion (SWDLDF).</p>
    <p>The three par­ties had met sep­a­rately to dis­cuss con­cerns from key stake­hold­ers and tried to find ways to re­solve the mat­ter over the past week, it added.</p>
    <p>“All three par­ties also agreed that while we wel­come dif­fer­ent views on artis­tic ex­pres­sion, we do not con­done hurt­ful re­marks and per­sonal at­tacks on in­di­vid­u­als posted on social me­dia,” it said.</p>
    <p>“It is not con­sis­tent with the gra­cious and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety that we wish to see.”</p>
    <p>PA and SWDLDF said: “We ex­press our sup­port and sol­i­dar­ity with DSI, and hope the young dancers af­fected will heal from the harm done to them.”</p>
