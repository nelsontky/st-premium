    <p>My fa­ther is a 74-year-old taxi driver. Since phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing started, he has gone back to work­ing as a re­lief driver with Com­fortDelGro.</p>
    <p>My fam­ily wor­ries for his health every day and ad­vises him to wear a mask con­stantly when driv­ing, as well as to take breaks between rides and re­move his mask to breathe freely.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, a woman pas­sen­ger took off her mask as soon as she boarded the taxi, say­ing she wanted to breathe nor­mally. When my fa­ther tried to per­suade her to put on her mask, she got up­set and shouted at him.</p>
    <p>My un­cle is also a taxi driver. He was re­cently given a quar­an­tine or­der be­cause he hap­pened to pick up a pas­sen­ger who was later con­firmed to have Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Th­ese episodes show that taxi driv­ers are at risk each day they are out there driv­ing, espe­cially if there are pas­sen­gers like the one my fa­ther picked up who re­fused to keep her mask on.</p>
    <p>Many taxi driv­ers are like my fa­ther and un­cle – el­derly and espe­cially vul­ner­a­ble to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>I do not re­call any signs in­side taxis or pri­vate-hire cars telling pas­sen­gers to keep their masks on. It is taken for granted that peo­ple will com­ply with this gen­eral rule, but clearly this is not the case.</p>
    <p>I urge the Min­istry of Health to is­sue a stern re­minder on the wear­ing of masks when in­side taxis or pri­vate-hire cars.</p>
    <p>In cases where pas­sen­gers re­main de­fi­ant de­spite be­ing told to wear their masks, driv­ers should have the right to force them to alight or to take them to the po­lice sta­tion.</p>
    <p>This is to safe­guard the lives of taxi driv­ers.</p>
    <p>I do not think taxi driv­ers should stop work­ing just be­cause of a few in­con­sid­er­ate peo­ple.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that if pas­sen­gers can do their part by not go­ing out if they feel un­well, keep­ing their masks on and sani­tis­ing their hands be­fore pass­ing their cards or cash to driv­ers, the risk of in­fec­tion will be low.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies like Com­fortDelGro should put up signs in­side the taxis ad­vis­ing pas­sen­gers to keep their masks on through­out their jour­neys. Pas­sen­gers should also have ac­cess to hand sani­tiser in­side the ve­hi­cles.</p>
