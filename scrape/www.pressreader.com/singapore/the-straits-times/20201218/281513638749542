    <p>A Chi­nese space­craft car­ry­ing rocks and soil from the Moon has re­turned safely to Earth, un­der­lin­ing China’s grow­ing prow­ess and am­bi­tion in space. The mis­sion em­u­lated the feats of the United States and the Soviet Union from the 1960s and 1970s, and even went a few steps fur­ther.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • An un­manned Chi­nese space­craft car­ry­ing rocks and soil from the Moon re­turned safely to Earth early yes­ter­day, com­plet­ing an­other chap­ter in China’s bid to be­come a space su­per­power.</p>
    <p>The mis­sion was the first in four decades to col­lect lu­nar sam­ples, em­u­lat­ing the feats of the United States and the Soviet Union from the 1960s and 1970s – and go­ing a few steps fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists hope the sam­ples will give in­sights into the Moon’s ori­gins and vol­canic ac­tiv­ity, though a more im­me­di­ate fo­cus was on how the mis­sion show­cased China’s tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances.</p>
    <p>“China has been pre­par­ing for this for a long time,” said Dr Jonathan Mc­Dow­ell, a Har­vard-Smith­so­nian Cen­tre for Astro­physics re­searcher. “This was very im­por­tant to them – and still risky – as the au­to­matic ren­dezvous, dock­ing and sam­ple trans­fer in lu­nar or­bit had never been done be­fore, by any­one. It’s a sign of the ma­tu­rity of the Chi­nese space ef­fort that it went off so flaw­lessly.”</p>
    <p>Images aired on state tele­vi­sion show the black­ened cap­sule land­ing on snow-cov­ered grass­lands in dark­ness in the coun­try’s re­mote north. A Chi­nese flag was quickly placed next to the cap­sule, re­flect­ing the na­tion­al­ist pride that the multi-bil­lion-dol­lar space pro­gramme en­gen­ders.</p>
    <p>China launched its first satel­lite in 1970 but hu­man space­flight took decades longer, with mil­i­tary pi­lot Yang Li­wei be­com­ing the coun­try’s first “taiko­naut” in 2003.</p>
    <p>Un­der Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, who took power in 2012, China’s “space dream” has been put into over­drive. A Chi­nese lu­nar rover landed on the far side of the Moon in Jan­uary last year – a global first.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency de­scribed the lat­est mis­sion as one of the most chal­leng­ing and com­pli­cated in China’s aero­space history.</p>
    <p>Chang’e-5, named af­ter a myth­i­cal Chi­nese Moon god­dess, landed on the Moon on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing two days on the Moon, it col­lected 2kg of ma­te­rial in a vol­canic area called Mons Ruemker in the Oceanus Pro­cel­larum – or “Ocean of Storms” – which was pre­vi­ously un­ex­plored, China’s space agency said. While there, it raised the Chi­nese flag, the agency said.</p>
    <p>The probe’s de­par­ture was the first time China had achieved take­off from an ex­trater­res­trial body. The mod­ule then went through the del­i­cate op­er­a­tion of link­ing up in lu­nar or­bit with the part of the space­craft that brought the sam­ples back to Earth.</p>
    <p>“With this suc­cess­ful mis­sion, China will be more con­fi­dent of its own tech­nolo­gies,” Mr Chen Lan, an in­de­pen­dent an­a­lyst at GoTaiko­nauts.com, which spe­cialises in China’s space pro­gramme, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>China’s space agency said the coun­try will share data and sam­ples from the Moon ob­tained by Chang’e 5 probe on the ba­sis of in­ter­na­tional con­ven­tions, though “un­for­tu­nate” US re­stric­tions on co­op­er­a­tion might pre­vent it get­ting any. “In ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion con­ven­tions and mul­ti­lat­eral and bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion pacts, we will is­sue rules on man­ag­ing the Moon sam­ples and data,” said China National Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion deputy head Wu Yan­hua.</p>
    <p>“We will share with the rel­e­vant coun­tries and sci­en­tists over­seas, and some of them may be given as national gifts in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional prac­tices.”</p>
    <p>When asked if China would share any sam­ples with the United States, which lim­its its Nasa space agency from di­rectly co­op­er­at­ing with China, Mr Wu said ex­ist­ing US re­stric­tions were “un­for­tu­nate”.</p>
    <p>China has not dis­closed the amount of sam­ples that it had re­trieved. The plan had been to col­lect 2kg of rocks and soil.</p>
