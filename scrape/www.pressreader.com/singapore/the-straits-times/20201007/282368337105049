    <p>• Ar­gen­tinian Na­dia Podor­oska was at a loss for words af­ter be­com­ing the first qual­i­fier to reach the French Open semi-fi­nals in the women’s sin­gles draw when she beat Ukrainian third seed Elina Svi­tolina 6-2, 6-4 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The world No. 131 em­u­lates Bel­gium’s Filip Dewulf, the only qual­i­fier in ei­ther of the sin­gles draws since tennis turned pro­fes­sional in 1968, to make it to the last four at Roland Gar­ros in 1997.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lit­tle bit dif­fi­cult for me to speak af­ter the match, thank you ev­ery­body for your sup­port, I’m very, very happy,” the 23-year-old, whose only other Ma­jor ap­pear­ance came at the 2016 US Open, said on Court Philippe Cha­trier.</p>
    <p>“We did a very good job with my coaches dur­ing quar­an­tine. I’ve been train­ing a lot with my team, I think that’s why I’m here to­day.”</p>
    <p>She had never won a Grand Slam main draw match be­fore the tour­na­ment and is the first Ar­gen­tinian woman to reach the last four of a Ma­jor since Paola Suarez in Paris in 2004.</p>
    <p>She is guar­an­teed €425,250 (S$681,400) fol­low­ing her break­out per­for­mance, more than her to­tal ca­reer earn­ings of US$301,547 (S$410,000).</p>
    <p>It was the first time she had even faced a player in­side the top 20, hav­ing started the year ranked 255th.</p>
    <p>She next faces ei­ther Pol­ish teenager Iga Swiatek or an­other qual­i­fier, Ital­ian Martina Tre­visan, with all three en­joy­ing ca­reer-best runs at a Slam.</p>
    <p>World No. 5 Svi­tolina, one of the tour­na­ment favourites af­ter win­ning in Stras­bourg last month, suf­fered a third quar­ter-fi­nal de­feat in as many at­tempts at Roland Gar­ros, hav­ing also lost in 2015 and 2017.</p>
    <p>The Ukrainian was on the back foot through­out, hit­ting just eight win­ners – the same num­ber of times she dropped serve – and fell to her worst de­feat at a Slam in re­la­tion to her op­po­nent’s rank­ing.</p>
    <p>“In the end, I wasn’t 100 per cent men­tally on it to­day, and that was re­ally dis­ap­point­ing. I was too fo­cused on the neg­a­tive things, what wasn’t go­ing right,” said Svi­tolina.</p>
    <p>“I had the op­por­tu­nity but it didn’t hap­pen, and right now, it’s for sure up­set­ting, but in the end, life con­tin­ues.”</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier match, un­seeded Danielle Collins bat­tled past Tu­nisian Ons Jabeur 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 to reach the quar­ter-fi­nals for the first time in her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>She will face Aus­tralian Open cham­pion Sofia Kenin next, af­ter the fourth-seeded Amer­i­can re­cov­ered to beat French­woman Fiona Ferro 2-6, 6-2, 6-1 in their last-16 tie on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Also on Mon­day, No­vak Djokovic racked up his 35th win of the year and a place in the quar­ter-fi­nals at</p>
    <p>Roland Gar­ros for the 14th time with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 win over Rus­sia’s Karen Khachanov.</p>
    <p>The world No. 1 will face Spain’s Pablo Car­reno Busta to­day for a place in the semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Separately, French prose­cu­tors said yes­ter­day they have opened an in­ves­ti­ga­tion last Thurs­day into al­leged match-fix­ing in a women’s dou­bles tie. The probe con­cerns the first-round match on Sept 30 be­tween Ro­ma­nian pair Andreea Mitu and Pa­tri­cia Maria Tig, and Yana Sizikova of Rus­sia with Amer­i­can Madi­son Bren­gle, ac­cord­ing to French sports daily L’Equipe and Ger­man news­pa­per Die Welt.</p>
    <p>The fifth game of the sec­ond set – won by love by Mitu and Tig af­ter Sizikova served two dou­ble faults – has come un­der the mi­cro­scope.</p>
    <p>L’Equipe said large sums of money were bet on the Ro­ma­ni­ans win­ning the game, with bets placed in sev­eral coun­tries through Paris­based gambling out­lets. Prose­cu­tors are look­ing into al­leged “fraud in an or­gan­ised group” and “ac­tive and pas­sive cor­rup­tion in sport”.</p>
    <p>When asked about the case, the French Open or­gan­is­ers re­ferred Reuters to the Tennis In­tegrity Unit, who de­clined to com­ment.</p>
