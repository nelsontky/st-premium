    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture is both tan­gi­ble and in­tan­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>It is about the food but also about much more than the food.</p>
    <p>Rich and poor, folk of ev­ery stripe and colour head to one of 6,000 hawker stalls in the 110 hawker cen­tres ev­ery day for meals, in lean times and in fat.</p>
    <p>The rules of en­gage­ment ap­ply pretty much equally to all – we queue for our food, we some­times share ta­bles with strangers, we re­turn our trays af­ter eat­ing and leave the ta­bles clean.</p>
    <p>Maybe the part where trays are re­turned and ta­bles stay clean is not a given. But I live in hope that one day, they will just hap­pen nat­u­rally.</p>
    <p>Hawker cul­ture is deeply in­grained in us. Only peo­ple who live in sad bub­bles do not eat in, walk past, ru­mi­nate and have opin­ions about hawker stalls and hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore with­out hawker cen­tres is un­think­able. They are part of our daily lives, part of our psy­che, part of the soul of this coun­try.</p>
    <p>Unesco agrees. On Wed­nes­day night, it put Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture on its in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage list.</p>
    <p>So, what changes now? Noth­ing, at least not on the sur­face.</p>
    <p>Hawk­ers will wake up early to­mor­row morn­ing – ear­lier than most of us – to get their stalls up and run­ning. Cus­tomers will throng the cen­tres for kopi and break­fast. There will be a lunch rush and a surge at din­ner time. Un­cles will have beers and shoot the breeze un­til 10.30pm, af­ter which no booze can be con­sumed.</p>
    <p>But by mak­ing the sub­mis­sion to Unesco, Sin­ga­pore com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing the cul­ture stays alive, vi­brant and rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>It has not been sit­ting on its hands all this time, of course. Hawker cen­tres are cleaned, up­graded and re­tooled reg­u­larly; new ones are planned, built and filled; groups have been formed to think about the fu­ture of hawker cul­ture; and pro­grammes have been in­tro­duced to groom a new gen­er­a­tion of hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>All of this will now in­ten­sify.</p>
    <p>Last month, the National En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) an­nounced the hawker suc­ces­sion scheme. Pre­vi­ously, it was not pos­si­ble for re­tir­ing hawk­ers to hand over their stalls to non-rel­a­tives. But in a bid to keep the cul­ture alive, this rule will be re­laxed.</p>
    <p>The pool of el­i­gi­ble hawk­ers is not big, but those who can and want to pass on their stalls to non-rel­a­tives will be matched with as­pir­ing hawk­ers. Their heir­loom recipes will have a fight­ing chance to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>If the hawk­ers’ own chil­dren can­not or will not take over the busi­nesses, per­haps an­other young man or woman will take the plunge – know­ing that Sin­ga­pore is com­mit­ted to safe­guard­ing hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Some have pointed out that the scheme will ben­e­fit only pop­u­lar stall­hold­ers, who have brand names that will at­tract cus­tomers even af­ter they re­tire.</p>
    <p>But this scheme is just one ap­proach to mak­ing sure hawker cul­ture thrives.</p>
    <p>It is bol­stered by the train­ing, ap­pren­tice­ship and in­cu­ba­tion pro­grammes NEA has in­tro­duced since 2013 to at­tract young peo­ple to a trade where prac­ti­tion­ers have a me­dian age of 59.</p>
    <p>No doubt these will be de­tailed in the re­ports Sin­ga­pore will have to send to Unesco ev­ery six years about its ef­forts to safe­guard hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Pro­grammes and sub­si­dies aside, there is one other fac­tor that will en­sure the cul­ture stays alive: the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It has af­fected ev­ery part of our lives this year, and its ef­fects will linger for a long time.</p>
    <p>This bodes well for hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>When hawker cen­tres were closed to din­ers dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and hawk­ers could of­fer only take­aways, star­tling things be­gan to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery plat­forms, which usu­ally de­liver food from restau­rants, started of­fer­ing to de­liver hawker food, with some charg­ing lower com­mis­sions and fees for this.</p>
    <p>That meant hawk­ers could get their food not just to peo­ple liv­ing in the area, but also is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>New de­liv­ery play­ers ap­peared, in­clud­ing hawker de­liv­ery plat­form WhyQ, which de­liv­ers hawker food with no min­i­mum or­der re­quire­ment and a de­liv­ery fee of $1.50; so­cial en­ter­prise Makan Guru; and Bungkus SG, which de­liv­ers food from ha­lal restau­rants and hawker stalls.</p>
    <p>Other ser­vices such as Crumbly and SG Dabao point hun­gry cus­tomers to hawker stalls which of­fer de­liv­ery ser­vices.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia groups like Hawk­ers United at­tracted many fol­low­ers who wanted to know what deals, bun­dles and de­liv­ery ser­vices hawk­ers were of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren of hawk­ers, the ones so re­luc­tant to fol­low in their par­ents’ foot­steps, were pressed into ser­vice to fig­ure out de­liv­ery ser­vices and charges, and to har­ness the power of so­cial me­dia to keep their par­ents’ busi­nesses afloat.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic shook things up and got hawk­ers think­ing be­yond their small busi­nesses. It got them to hus­tle hard.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents in Be­dok could have food de­liv­ered from a hawker stall across the is­land. Groups of res­i­dents started con­sol­i­dat­ing their or­ders for group buys, mak­ing it pos­si­ble for cus­tomers to or­der just what they need and worth­while for hawk­ers to send food to them.</p>
    <p>Things are slowly go­ing back to what passes for nor­mal, and peo­ple can once again eat in hawker cen­tres. But cus­tomers may have found new favourite stalls. They know who has good deals. And many more are now used to hav­ing food de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home has changed our rou­tines. Once, we might have bought food from the of­fice can­teen or gone to a restau­rant. But now it is eas­ier to just walk across the street to tar pau a packet of chicken rice from the neigh­bour­hood hawker cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The hawk­ers them­selves should have gleaned the pos­si­bil­i­ties: They now have new ways of pre­sent­ing their food, and they know they need to come up with new menu items and find ways to get their food to far-flung cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has forced them to find new ways to do busi­ness in or­der to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Sur­vival is the thread that runs through gen­er­a­tions of hawk­ers. Peo­ple hawked food in the streets to sur­vive. They fig­ured out they had bet­ter turn out bet­ter food than the hawker next to them just to sur­vive. They moved off the streets and into hawker cen­tres to sur­vive when cus­tomers de­manded cleaner set­tings in which to buy and eat the food.</p>
    <p>And they started open­ing for longer hours and cater­ing to cus­tomers’ chang­ing life­styles, to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>The rest of us have to sur­vive too. While 2020 has brought one shock af­ter an­other, 2021 will be the year to hun­ker down, tighten our belts and brace our­selves for the start of a few dif­fi­cult years of re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>More than ever, we will need the af­ford­able and mostly de­li­cious food that hawk­ers serve.</p>
    <p>What would we do with­out them? Who would we be with­out them?</p>
