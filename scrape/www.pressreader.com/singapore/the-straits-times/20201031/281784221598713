    <p>Umno may be seething at be­ing side­lined in ma­jor pol­i­cy­mak­ing, but in­ter­nal schisms in the largest party of the Muhyid­din Yassin govern­ment have led to an in­de­ci­sive­ness that saw a se­ries of meet­ings this week lead to lit­tle more than an af­fir­ma­tion of the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>This comes even as the Prime Min­is­ter suf­fered a ma­jor set­back when Malaysia’s King re­fused con­sent on Sun­day for an emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mon­day saw Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi locked in meet­ings the en­tire day to dis­cuss with party lead­ers, as well as chiefs of the Barisan Na­sional coali­tion it leads, how to re­act to the royal re­buff of the govern­ment’s shock move to ask for emer­gency pow­ers.</p>
    <p>But de­spite anger at be­ing left in the dark over such a ma­jor de­ci­sion – made dur­ing a spe­cial Cab­i­net meet­ing con­vened just hours be­fore the re­quest was pre­sented to the palace on Oct 23 – Umno even­tu­ally con­firmed its sup­port for the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) govern­ment.</p>
    <p>An­other marathon four-hour Supreme Coun­cil meet­ing on Thurs­day ended with Zahid re­peat­ing that Umno will back Bud­get 2021, to be tabled next Fri­day, as de­creed by Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah to politi­cians across the di­vide. He also called for snap polls to be held af­ter the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is un­der con­trol. But the push for fresh elec­tions is not new.</p>
    <p>Umno has called for a na­tional vote since last year, when the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion was torn over if and when Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim should suc­ceed Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>When Dr Ma­hathir re­signed in Fe­bru­ary af­ter the PH govern­ment col­lapsed due to his Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia leav­ing the coali­tion, Umno again asked Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah to dis­solve Par­lia­ment, be­fore set­tling on Ber­satu pres­i­dent Muhyid­din as premier.</p>
    <p>The main dif­fer­ence to­day is that go­ing to the bal­lot box is as much about en­sur­ing a stable govern­ment – PN’s ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment has been un­der as­sault since be­ing formed in March – as re­solv­ing splits in the once-dom­i­nant Malay party that ruled Malaysia from in­de­pen­dence un­til its shock 2018 de­feat.</p>
    <p>“It’s a call to re­store what Umno sees is the nat­u­ral or­der of things – that the party pres­i­dent holds the high­est po­si­tion in govern­ment. The mes­sage from Umno is clear: Ber­satu may have to con­test on its own at the next gen­eral elec­tion if it does not con­cur with this view,” risk an­a­lysts Bow­erGroupAsi­a’s di­rec­tor Adib Zalka­pli told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The one unit­ing theme in Umno is dis­gruntle­ment over not just play­ing sec­ond fid­dle to Ber­satu in shar­ing the spoils of power, but also be­ing side­lined in im­por­tant de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>But de­spite re­ports and wide­spread spec­u­la­tion that Umno – which ac­counts for 39 out of PN’s 113</p>
    <p>MPs – would name a can­di­date for the va­cant deputy premier­ship, ST un­der­stands that there was an un­spo­ken agree­ment not to raise the di­vi­sive topic at the Thurs­day meet­ing of its top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body, amid dis­agree­ment over four po­ten­tials rep­re­sent­ing var­i­ous fac­tions in the party.</p>
    <p>A source re­vealed that “in­stead, a lot of time was spent at­tack­ing Ber­satu for its ar­ro­gance”.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Ter­ri­to­ries Umno chief Jo­hari Ab­dul Ghani told ST “we did not dis­cuss about the DPM (deputy prime min­is­ter)” and the meet­ing stretched on to “man­age all other views from Supreme Coun­cil mem­bers”. He said the sum of the dis­cus­sions was to en­sure the fight against Covid-19 is won and then to go to the polls to re­solve in­sta­bil­ity in the coun­try, as well as the party.</p>
    <p>“Umno will con­tinue to sup­port a con­fi­dence and sup­ply agree­ment in the com­ing Par­lia­ment ses­sion,” the for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter said, in­di­cat­ing that its stance of not for­mally join­ing Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s PN coali­tion re­mains in place.</p>
    <p>The main dif­fer­ence to­day is that go­ing to the bal­lot box is as much about en­sur­ing a stable govern­ment – PN’s ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment has been un­der as­sault since be­ing formed in March – as re­solv­ing splits in the once-dom­i­nant Malay party that ruled Malaysia from in­de­pen­dence un­til its shock 2018 de­feat.</p>
