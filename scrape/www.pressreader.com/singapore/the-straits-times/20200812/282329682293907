    <p>Due to the global Covid-19 pan­demic, the For­mula 1 2020 rac­ing season started only last month, in­stead of in March, and it will have only 12 races, in­stead of the sched­uled 22.</p>
    <p>How­ever, you can race vir­tu­ally through the 22 tracks, in­clud­ing the new Cir­cuit Zand­voort in Nether­lands and Hanoi street cir­cuit in Viet­nam, if you play the of­fi­cial F1 2020 game, which also lets you start and man­age an F1 team.</p>
    <p>Let us start with the game’s sta­ple ca­reer mode. The cheesy story mode, in which you have a made-up arch ri­val, found in the game’s pre­de­ces­sor, is gone. In­stead, you start with be­ing a promis­ing F2 driver in the 2019 season, where you can choose to par­tic­i­pate in a par­tial or full season and not just three races as in the pre­vi­ous game.</p>
    <p>The F2 races serve as a nice warm-up to get used to the gameplay el­e­ments, from driv­ing to choos­ing a car setup.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, though, you have to cre­ate your in-game avatar, and this is where the game falls short. There are lim­ited customisat­ion op­tions for the avatar – you can choose only from an ex­ist­ing li­brary of faces, in which I find only two Asians.</p>
    <p>There are more op­tions for hel­mets, car liv­er­ies, race suits and cel­e­bra­tion emotes. Still, these op­tions are rel­a­tively sparse com­pared with top-tier rac­ing games such as Forza Mo­tor­sport and Gran Turismo.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on how well you do in the F2 2019 season, you will be of­fered a place in one of the 10 F1 teams for the 2020 season.</p>
    <p>Like its pre­de­ces­sors, F1 2020 reigns over its com­pe­ti­tion in terms of rac­ing sim­u­la­tion, graph­ics, broad­cast-like pre­sen­ta­tion and au­dio real­ism.</p>
    <p>Rac­ing a vir­tual F1 car is never easy, but you can tweak the dif­fi­culty to match your skill. Those new to the game can, for in­stance, turn on all the driv­ing as­sists, in­clud­ing steer­ing, brak­ing and trac­tion con­trol.</p>
    <p>But even with these as­sists, a lapse of con­cen­tra­tion will send you crash­ing out of a race. And it can be hard to fo­cus with the mono­tone roar of the en­gine, as there is no mu­sic when you are rac­ing an F1 car.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, you can use the flash­back func­tion, which al­lows you to rewind a few sec­onds of the race at any point and restart, to rec­tify the mis­takes you have made.</p>
    <p>A new fea­ture and prob­a­bly the ma­jor highlight of F1 2020 is the My Team mode, which al­lows you to cre­ate your own F1 team and en­ter the 2020 season as the 11th team on the grid.</p>
    <p>You have to as­sem­ble your team from scratch, in­clud­ing find­ing spon­sors, pick­ing the right en­gine, re­cruit­ing driv­ers and select­ing liv­er­ies and a logo. The best part is you will be one of the two driv­ers in your team.</p>
    <p>I find this mode to be ad­dic­tive. Not only are you think­ing about driv­ing and win­ning races, but you are also think­ing about ways to make more money for your team by hold­ing events like mer­chan­dise sales. And you need to have team­build­ing ac­tiv­i­ties to raise mo­rale, but these cost money, which you need to track to en­sure you have enough to up­grade your car. Ul­ti­mately, the suc­cess of the team de­pends on race re­sults.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if you are not an F1 fan, you might be over­whelmed by all the things you need to do. This is es­pe­cially so if you are not fa­mil­iar with rac­ing jar­gon such as pow­er­train, drag re­duc­tion and en­ergy re­cov­ery sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, with the new My Team mode and its re­al­is­tic rac­ing sim­u­la­tion, the F1 2020 game will pro­vide you with many hours of rac­ing fun.</p>
