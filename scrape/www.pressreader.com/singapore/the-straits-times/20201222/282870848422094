    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES The l on­gawaited open­ing of Los An­ge­les’ Os­cars mu­seum has been post­poned again due to the pan­demic, with of­fi­cials say­ing its sched­uled April de­but would be “ir­re­spon­si­ble” as the city grap­ples with record coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The Academy Mu­seum of Mo­tion Pic­tures, ded­i­cated to the magic of movies and set to host iconic Hol­ly­wood trea­sures from Judy Gar­land’s Wizard Of Oz (1939) ruby slip­pers to Drac­ula’s cape, has been be­set by de­lays. It had been set to fi­nally open on April 30 next year, the week af­ter the Academy’s flag­ship event – the Os­cars – but will now wel­come vis­i­tors from Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Bill Kramer said in a state­ment last week that the mu­seum was “ready and ea­ger to wel­come vis­i­tors in the spring”, but “with the cur­rent surge of Covid-19, it would be ir­re­spon­si­ble to main­tain an April open­ing”.</p>
    <p>“We know a new day is com­ing for us all, and when it does, the Academy Mu­seum will be ready to of­fer our vis­i­tors the re­mark­able ex­pe­ri­ence we have all been want­ing.”</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia has emerged as the lat­est epi­cen­tre in the United States’ Covid-19 out­break, re­port­ing more than 52,000 new cases last Wed­nes­day. All in­door Los An­ge­les mu­se­ums are closed due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions, with a re­gional “stay-at-home” order in ef­fect un­til at least Dec 28.</p>
    <p>The Os­cars were post­poned by eight weeks to April 25, af­ter the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut­tered movie theatres and wreaked havoc on Hol­ly­wood’s re­lease cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>The fu­tur­is­tic Academy Mu­seum con­tains a 1,000-seat theatre in­side a seem­ingly sus­pended glass, steel and con­crete orb de­signed by Ital­ian ar­chi­tect Renzo Pi­ano, con­nected by sky bridges to a con­verted depart­ment store hous­ing the main gal­leries – and the re­cently in­stalled 7.5m shark model used in Jaws (1975).</p>
