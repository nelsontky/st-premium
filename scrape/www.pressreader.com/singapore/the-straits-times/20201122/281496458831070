    <p>I was in­vited to spend a cou­ple of hours at a sur­gi­cal mask fac­tory in Sin­ga­pore and my first thought was: “They still make things in Sin­ga­pore?”</p>
    <p>So I know about the Dyson fac­tory and the Rolls-Royce fa­cil­ity, then my mind is blank.</p>
    <p>Well, be­cause of the pan­demic, I can add one more thing to the men­tal list of con­sumer prod­ucts made here.</p>
    <p>It turns out ma­chines are churn­ing out masks 10 min­utes from where I live in Be­dok. In its Chai Chee Lane fac­tory, The Well­ness Fel­lows com­pany can make up to 60,000 of them in a shift from 9am to 6pm.</p>
    <p>Chances are, you are not wear­ing one of them.</p>
    <p>The masks are not for the, uh, price-sen­si­tive.</p>
    <p>Sold un­der The Mask Fel­lows brand, they go for around $25 for a 50-piece box on e-com­merce sites like Lazada.</p>
    <p>A quick browse at shops near me and on on­line shop­ping sites shows that made-in-China masks are well un­der $10 a box. In a shop the other day, I saw a $5 tag on one.</p>
    <p>A mask is a mask is a mask, right? Are the made-in-Sin­ga­pore prod­ucts sewn with gold thread? Will they emit vi­bra­tions that will at­tract your soul­mate?</p>
    <p>When I ar­rive at the head­quar­ters, the team be­hind the com­pany put me in a con­fer­ence room and launch into a pre­sen­ta­tion for their au­di­ence of one. They are in­tense and pre­pared, they have Pow­er­point and mean to use it.</p>
    <p>They are the kind of pre­sen­ters who stop af­ter mak­ing a point to make sure it has sunk in and will not go on un­til I make a ges­ture show­ing that it has sunk in. I nod and nod so much I fear my neck may never re­cover.</p>
    <p>It is all about cer­ti­fi­ca­tions – an al­pha­bet soup of them – awarded in Sin­ga­pore, Europe, the United States and else­where, stat­ing that the masks are made ac­cord­ing to stan­dards. You can go to the com­pany’s web­site (www.the­mask­fel­lows.com) to learn about them.</p>
    <p>Here is why the masks cost more, com­pany founder and man­ag­ing direc­tor Daniel Chui says in an e-mail: “You need a re­li­able, trusted and strong shield to fight any war. Learn the science and un­der­stand the rea­son for the price.</p>
    <p>“A sur­gi­cal mask goes through a strin­gent set of tests in ac­cor­dance with global stan­dards, with cer­ti­fi­ca­tion and reg­u­la­tory ap­proval car­ried out be­fore it’s sold to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“A sur­gi­cal mask is your best de­fence and shield be­tween death and the virus be­cause it is a med­i­cal de­vice – it’s not just a per­sonal choice.”</p>
    <p>I hope you read the bit about death. Nod if you have. As I said, they are in­tense.</p>
    <p>Time to go on to the maskmak­ing part.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion lines are clean. I don the head-to-toe gear – plas­tic coat, gloves, hair cap, shoe cov­ers – and then go into a cham­ber where jets of air blast ev­ery bit of me be­fore I can en­ter the shop floor.</p>
    <p>In short, each line takes three spools of fab­ric – the in­ner, mid­dle and outer lay­ers – and fuses them into a sand­wich.</p>
    <p>Down­stream, ear loops are added and be­fore each mask is sealed in its own plas­tic bag, I check for qual­ity, toss­ing out any mask with ear­loops not fused on firmly enough.</p>
    <p>And that is it, re­ally.</p>
    <p>It is nearly all au­to­mated, so I do a cou­ple of re­main­ing hu­man tasks, such as load­ing new spools on the spin­dle and gath­er­ing the sealed masks for pack­ag­ing into boxes later on.</p>
    <p>I also sit in the pack­ing line, count­ing out masks for their 30-count packs and plac­ing them into a box.</p>
    <p>I try to sim­u­late ac­tual con­di­tions by mak­ing idle chit-chat with two women pack­ers on my left, but they refuse to en­gage. I think it is be­cause of the count­ing rather than my per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The Well­ness Fel­lows plan fac­tory tours for the pub­lic next month, so check its web­site. Dy­nasty Travel will also of­fer the tours (in­di­cate your in­ter­est by e-mail­ing siewleen­diong@dy­nasty travel.com.sg). The one-hour tour should cost $25, which in­cludes a box of masks, off­set­ting the price of en­try.</p>
    <p>As I leave, the folks there give me a goodie bag filled with masks, with the few that I touched with my gloved hands in there as a keep­sake. It is a nice ges­ture, but most likely, it is to main­tain qual­ity con­trol.</p>
    <p>So rest easy know­ing that if you get a Mask Fel­lows pack, it will have been made by some­one who ac­tu­ally knows what they are do­ing.</p>
