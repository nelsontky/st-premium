    <p>Even as the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore sta­bilises and the coun­try shifts its fo­cus to eco­nomic re­cov­ery, it needs to stay open and con­nected to the world, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day. Man­ag­ing the coun­try’s dual iden­tity – as both city and nation – is crit­i­cal to Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans may be able to fly to Hong Kong to savour the lat­ter’s culi­nary delights and other leisure ac­tiv­i­ties in sev­eral weeks with the eas­ing of travel re­stric­tions be­tween both cities an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While de­tails are still be­ing worked out and no date has been firmed up yet, Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong have agreed to es­tab­lish an air travel bub­ble to al­low peo­ple from ei­ther city to fly to the other.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers un­der this ar­range­ment do not need to be quar­an­tined when they ar­rive in their des­ti­na­tion city, but they must have tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 be­fore their flight.</p>
    <p>They also have to take ded­i­cated flights that do not al­low tran­sit pas­sen­gers to board, but there are oth­er­wise no re­stric­tions to trav­ellers’ itin­er­ar­ies or on the pur­pose of their travel.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of flights that can op­er­ate be­tween the two cities will also be raised or low­ered based on the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said the ar­range­ment was a small but sig­nif­i­cant one for both cities, and will be a model for fu­ture air travel agree­ments.</p>
    <p>Travel agen­cies and res­i­dents in Sin­ga­pore cheered the an­nounce­ment, with the former say­ing they would work closely with tourism as­so­ci­a­tions to en­sure trav­ellers are safe when they fly to and back from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>This is the first travel bub­ble ar­range­ment for Hong Kong. In­clud­ing the Chi­nese city, Sin­ga­pore has 10 spe­cial travel ar­range­ments with var­i­ous places such as Ja­pan and New Zealand, with dif­fer­ences be­tween the agree­ments.</p>
