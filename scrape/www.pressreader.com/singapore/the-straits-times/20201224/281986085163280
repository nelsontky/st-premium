    <p>It is no co­in­ci­dence that banks and the health­care sec­tor have set up in-house de­sign teams to look at how to bet­ter meet the needs of cus­tomers or pa­tients.</p>
    <p>It is a re­flec­tion of how de­sign has be­come in­creas­ingly piv­otal in peo­ple’s daily ex­pe­ri­ences, said Mr Low Cheaw Hwei, who heads a newly formed De­sign Ed­u­ca­tion Ad­vi­sory Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent in­ter­view with The Straits Times, he de­tailed how de­sign ed­u­ca­tion has grown from be­ing rel­a­tively niche to a more widely recog­nised prac­tice.</p>
    <p>At the heart of this growth is the recog­ni­tion that the ed­u­ca­tion of de­sign­ers cov­ers as­pects that are cru­cial in the mod­ern econ­omy – the fo­cus on un­der­stand­ing the users, work­ing in multi-dis­ci­plinary teams and find­ing so­lu­tions to prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The end prod­uct is a per­son im­bued with a po­tent com­bi­na­tion of prob­lem-solv­ing skills, cre­ative think­ing and em­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>These traits have “caught the at­ten­tion of the non-de­sign world”, he said. “They are very in­ter­ested and keen to see how... these ca­pa­bil­i­ties could be ap­plied in a non­cre­ative in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>The new com­mit­tee Mr Low heads will look at how in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing here adopt de­sign ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>It is the first na­tional-level com­mit­tee launched by the De­signSin­ga­pore Coun­cil – a sub­sidiary of the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board – and con­sists of nine in­dus­try lead­ers and 14 aca­demics from the in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, who have been ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Low, head of de­sign for Asi­aPa­cific at Philips Asean Pa­cific, was ap­pointed by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try, to chair the com­mit­tee for a two-year term from April.</p>
    <p>A re­source panel com­pris­ing in­ter­na­tional thought lead­ers and rep­re­sen­ta­tives from rel­e­vant agen­cies such as Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore and Work­force Sin­ga­pore, among oth­ers, has also been set up.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee, which has met thrice since Au­gust, will en­gage the panel in its work.</p>
    <p>Apart from im­prov­ing de­sign-re­lated cour­ses in higher learn­ing in­sti­tu­tions, Mr Low said the team wants to make de­sign a big­ger part of seem­ingly un­re­lated dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>This means tak­ing a closer look at how de­sign-re­lated skills such as em­pa­thy can be in­fused into non­de­sign cour­ses.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents study­ing busi­ness need to un­der­stand the needs of cus­tomers and put them­selves in the po­si­tion of the end user or the re­cip­i­ent of a busi­ness prod­uct or ser­vice that he or she cre­ates,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other ex­am­ple is health­care train­ing. “Doc­tors are trained in the tech­ni­cal skills in the field of medicine, but I think it will be also very use­ful for doc­tors to be armed with a set of ca­pa­bil­i­ties that demon­strate em­pa­thy, es­pe­cially to­wards pa­tients,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Low said the team hopes to re­shape the pub­lic per­cep­tion of de­sign. It also wants to ex­pand the types of jobs that de­sign grad­u­ates can go into.</p>
    <p>“I think in­creas­ingly in the new econ­omy... it’s no longer a com­po­si­tion of job types the in­dus­try needs. It’s very much about what ca­pa­bil­i­ties are re­quired in the in­dus­try to solve cer­tain prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>Hence, an in­te­rior de­sign grad­u­ate may move to other roles based on his skills and in­ter­ests, said Mr Low. “Our role... is about build­ing Sin­ga­pore’s next gen­er­a­tion of prob­lem-solvers, so we’re not just re­ly­ing on de­sign­ers to be cre­ative.”</p>
    <p>WHAT THE NEW ECON­OMY NEEDS</p>
    <p>I think in­creas­ingly in the new econ­omy... it’s no longer a com­po­si­tion of job types the in­dus­try needs. It’s very much about what ca­pa­bil­i­ties are re­quired in the in­dus­try to solve cer­tain prob­lems.</p>
