    <p>The Toronto Rap­tors are head­ing south for the win­ter – at least for the start of it.</p>
    <p>The 2019 Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) cham­pi­ons an­nounced on Fri­day they will be­gin the new sea­son based in Tampa, Florida, amid con­cerns about the coron­avirus pan­demic’s im­pact in Canada.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Ma­sai Ujiri, the Rap­tors’ pres­i­dent of bas­ket­ball op­er­a­tions, left open the pos­si­bil­ity that the team could re­turn to Toronto at some point this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Rap­tors are the only NBA team based out­side the United States, and Canada has im­posed strict mea­sures about travel be­tween the two coun­tries as cases con­tinue to sky­rocket in the US.</p>
    <p>“So we’ll be away from our home and our fans for now,” Ujiri said. “They say ab­sence makes the heart grow fonder. I’m not sure that’s pos­si­ble for us – we love Toronto and Canada, and we know we have the best fans in the NBA.</p>
    <p>“For now, I’ll ask you to cheer for us from afar, and we’ll look for­ward to the day we are all to­gether again.”</p>
    <p>The Rap­tors had been work­ing with Cana­dian govern­ment of­fi­cials for weeks to try to find a way to play games in Toronto this sea­son and Ujiri even wrote an op-ed for the Toronto Star last week to make a pub­lic plea for his case, but a com­pro­mise could not be struck.</p>
    <p>The NBA sea­son be­gins on Dec 22, with play­ers ar­riv­ing for train­ing camps on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>Free agency mean­while, is un­der way, with NBA cham­pi­ons Los Angeles Lak­ers quickly mov­ing on from the re­ported loss of backup big man Dwight Howard by agree­ing to a two-year, US$19 mil­lion (S$25.5 mil­lion) con­tract with Sixth Man of the Year Mon­trezl Har­rell, ac­cord­ing to ESPN.</p>
    <p>Howard’s agent, Charles Briscoe, con­firmed that the cen­tre had ac­cepted a one-year con­tract worth US$2.6 mil­lion with the Philadel­phia 76ers on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>While Howard made just two starts last sea­son, he was a key player off the bench for the Lak­ers, av­er­ag­ing 7.5 points and 7.3 re­bounds in 69 games. Har­rell will be a more than able re­place­ment, post­ing ca­reer highs of 18.6 points and 7.1 re­bounds in 63 reg­u­lar-sea­son games last term for LA Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>The deals of­fi­cially go through to­day.</p>
