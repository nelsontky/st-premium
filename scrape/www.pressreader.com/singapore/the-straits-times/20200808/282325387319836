    <p>• Gold smashed a record high yes­ter­day as a safety rush fu­elled by the wors­en­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic and its mount­ing eco­nomic toll gath­ered pace and put bul­lion on track for its long­est weekly win­ning streak in nearly a decade.</p>
    <p>Spot gold was up 0.3 per cent at US$2,069.78 per ounce by 0308 GMT af­ter hit­ting an all­time high of US$2,072.50 i n early trade. It has added 4.7 per cent so far this week in what would be its ninth straight weekly gain. US gold fu­tures rose 0.6 per cent to US$2,081.60.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver too con­tin­ued its stel­lar run, ris­ing as much as 3.1 per cent to US$29.84, adding nearly 19 per cent in what would be its best week since 1987.</p>
    <p>“It’s dif­fi­cult to hold any­thing but a con­struc­tive view (on gold),” said ING an­a­lyst War­ren Pat­ter­son. “While the pace of the rally may slow, there does seem to be fur­ther up­side... for the re­main­der of the year.”</p>
    <p>Surg­ing Covid-19 cases in the United States have damp­ened hopes for a nascent eco­nomic re­cov­ery and weighed on ri­val safe-haven, the US dol­lar. The green­back was headed for its sev­enth con­sec­u­tive weekly fall.</p>
    <p>Gold is likely to hover around US$2,020-US$2,080 an ounce in the near term, said Na­tional Aus­tralia Bank econ­o­mist J ohn Sharma. “The key fac­tor will be how this virus plays out, and whether there is any progress on vac­cines,” he added.</p>
    <p>Bench­mark 10-year US Trea­sury yields were at five-month lows, mak­ing the non-in­ter­est bear­ing bul­lion an at­trac­tive in­vest­ment, and help­ing it rise more than 35 per cent so far this year.</p>
