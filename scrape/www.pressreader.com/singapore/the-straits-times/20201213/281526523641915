    <p>Sin­ga­pore will do its part to meet the com­mit­ments un­der the Paris Agree­ment, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong in a video mes­sage at the Cli­mate Am­bi­tion Sum­mit yes­ter­day. The event saw global lead­ers share the steps they are tak­ing to reach the goal of net-zero emis­sions.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said that Sin­ga­pore has been tak­ing “bold steps” to achieve its Long-Term Low Emis­sions Devel­op­ment Strat­egy, such as qua­dru­pling so­lar en­ergy pro­duc­tion by 2025 and phas­ing out in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gine ve­hi­cles by 2040.</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore sub­mit­ted its first pledge un­der the Paris cli­mate pact in 2015, its main goal was to re­duce its emis­sions in­ten­sity by 36 per cent from 2005 lev­els, and to peak by around 2030.</p>
    <p>Un­der the en­hanced Na­tion­ally De­ter­mined Con­tri­bu­tion, Sin­ga­pore has com­mit­ted to the ab­so­lute peak emis­sions level of 65 mil­lion tonnes of car­bon diox­ide equiv­a­lent around 2030.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions chief An­to­nio Guter­res yes­ter­day called on gov­ern­ments to de­clare a “state of cli­mate emer­gency” and make good on their prom­ises to slash car­bon pol­lu­tion as they re­cover from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the open­ing of the Cli­mate Am­bi­tion Sum­mit, held on­line to mark five years since the Paris cli­mate deal, Mr Guter­res warned that na­tions’ cur­rent com­mit­ments were “far from enough” to limit tem­per­a­ture rises to 1.5 deg C.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t change course, we may be headed for a cat­a­strophic tem­per­a­ture rise of more than 3.0 de­grees this cen­tury,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That is why to­day, I call on all lead­ers world­wide to de­clare a state of cli­mate emer­gency in their coun­tries un­til car­bon neu­tral­ity is reached,” he added.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, France’s Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and Sin­ga­pore’s Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong are among the more than 75 lead­ers tak­ing part in the vir­tual sum­mit.</p>
    <p>In his video mes­sage at the sum­mit, PM Lee said Sin­ga­pore will do its part to meet the com­mit­ments un­der the Paris Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>“Cli­mate change is an ex­is­ten­tial threat for all of us, but es­pe­cially for a small is­land state like Sin­ga­pore. This global chal­lenge re­quires a global re­sponse. Sin­ga­pore will do our part, to­gether with other coun­tries,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>The Paris deal en­joined na­tions to limit warm­ing to “well be­low” 2 deg C through sweep­ing cuts to green­house gas emis­sions. But progress has stalled.</p>
    <p>The UN says emis­sions must fall 7.6 per cent an­nu­ally up to and in­clud­ing 2030 to keep the 1.5 deg C tem­per­a­ture cap in play. This year, as the pan­demic brought lock­downs and re­stric­tions on move­ment, emis­sions fell a record 7 per cent, the UN said last week.</p>
    <p>Mr Guter­res said the Group of 20 na­tions were spend­ing 50 per cent more in their res­cue pack­ages on sec­tors linked to fos­sil fuels than on those linked to low-car­bon en­ergy. “This is un­ac­cept­able. We can­not use these re­sources to lock in poli­cies that bur­den fu­ture gen­er­a­tions with a moun­tain of debt on a bro­ken planet,” he said.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi said China, the world’s big­gest emit­ter, would seek to cut emis­sions per unit of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct by more than 65 per cent from 2005 lev­els by 2030, rais­ing the tar­get from its pre­vi­ous goal of cut­ting pol­lu­tion by 60 per cent to 65 per cent. China will seek to make non-fos­sil fuels about 25 per cent of its pri­mary en­ergy mix by the end of the decade.</p>
    <p>The prom­ises were at the weak­est end of fore­casts by cli­mate ex­perts, and raise ques­tions about how se­ri­ous China is about its pledge to be car­bon neu­tral by 2060.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said that the Re­pub­lic has sub­mit­ted an en­hanced Na­tion­ally De­ter­mined Con­tri­bu­tion (NDC), or emis­sions pledge.</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore sub­mit­ted its first pledge un­der the Paris cli­mate pact in 2015, its main goal was to re­duce its emis­sions in­ten­sity by 36 per cent from 2005 lev­els, and to peak by around 2030.</p>
    <p>Un­der the en­hanced NDC, Sin­ga­pore has com­mit­ted to the ab­so­lute peak emis­sions level of 65 mil­lion tonnes of car­bon diox­ide equiv­a­lent around 2030.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also said that de­spite Sin­ga­pore’s al­ter­na­tive en­ergy re­straints, it is “tak­ing bold steps to achieve our long-term low emis­sions devel­op­ment strat­egy”.</p>
    <p>The steps in­clude qua­dru­pling so­lar en­ergy pro­duc­tion by 2025, phas­ing out in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gine ve­hi­cles by 2040, ac­tively in­vest­ing in low-car­bon so­lu­tions and pro­mot­ing green fi­nanc­ing, for ex­am­ple, through a US$2 bil­lion (S$2.7 bil­lion) Green In­vest­ments Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“These will help Sin­ga­pore tran­si­tion to a low-car­bon econ­omy. But ul­ti­mately, Sin­ga­pore will not be able to stop cli­mate change on our own. All coun­tries, big and small, must j oin hands and do our shares,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>He added: “Not only to ful­fil what we have agreed to un­der the Paris Agree­ment, but to con­tinue to push the en­ve­lope on cli­mate am­bi­tion, so that we min­imise the risk of a cli­mate catas­tro­phe de­stroy­ing our chil­dren’s world.”</p>
