    <p>Mr Tan Swan Hwee’s draw­ing of at­ten­tion to obe­sity be­ing a risk fac­tor for Covid-19 is timely (Obe­sity is a risk fac­tor for Covid-19, Dec 5).</p>
    <p>How­ever, many may not re­alise that obe­sity has long been a sig­nif­i­cant risk fac­tor for var­i­ous chronic dis­eases or non-com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases (NCDs) as de­fined by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>Close to 70 per cent of all deaths in the world are due to NCDs such as heart dis­ease, stroke, di­a­betes and can­cer, and NCDs ac­count for many pre­ma­ture deaths and mor­bidi­ties in young pro­duc­tive in­di­vid­u­als. Hence, NCDs im­pose a heavy toll on not only an in­di­vid­ual’s health, but also the so­cial and fi­nan­cial re­sources of fam­i­lies as well as the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Less ob­vi­ous to many peo­ple is that the harm in­flicted by obe­sity is in­sid­i­ous and of­ten starts dur­ing child­hood in obese chil­dren. It is not un­com­mon for obese chil­dren to de­velop pre-di­a­betes and fatty liver, among other med­i­cal con­di­tions. When obe­sity per­sists, pre-di­a­betes or fatty liver may soon lead to di­a­betes and in­flam­ma­tion of the liver when the in­di­vid­ual reaches his teens.</p>
    <p>Hence, it makes good sense to pay at­ten­tion to obe­sity not so much for the out­ward ap­pear­ance of the in­di­vid­ual, but pri­mar­ily for the dam­age to short- and long-term health.</p>
    <p>The heavy health, so­cial, fi­nan­cial and eco­nomic bur­dens of NCDs on the in­di­vid­ual, the fam­ily and the coun­try should not be ig­nored, es­pe­cially in Sin­ga­pore’s rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity and a healthy diet play im­por­tant roles in the preven­tion of obe­sity and sub­se­quent oc­cur­rence of NCDs. In recog­ni­tion of these life­style fac­tors, the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has im­proved in­fra­struc­ture to pro­mote and en­cour­age healthy changes to cit­i­zens’ life­styles. The pub­lic also needs to be proac­tive and pos­i­tively com­mit to life­style changes.</p>
    <p>The dic­tum “preven­tion is bet­ter than cure” still holds true to­day. Let not the sil­ver tsunami also be a tsunami of chronic dis­eases that breaks the camel’s back on our re­sources.</p>
