    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has de­fended his side’s poor home form in the Pre­mier League this sea­son, and backed his play­ers to pick up a win at Old Traf­ford today.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils are lan­guish­ing in 14th spot in the stand­ings with just 10 points af­ter seven games, and have been win­less at home with three de­feats and a draw.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing ahead of today’s home clash with West Brom, the Nor­we­gian said: “Home and away now is dif­fer­ent, not like it used to be.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had four home games in the league, the first one we look at us hav­ing no prepa­ra­tion and Palace de­served it (3-1 win).</p>
    <p>“Tot­ten­ham de­served win (6-1) af­ter An­thony (Mar­tial) send­ing off, other two games if we had our fans we might have sparked that lit­tle ex­tra X fac­tor we needed in two close games (0-0 draw with Chelsea and 1-0 loss to Ar­se­nal).</p>
    <p>“Our best win this sea­son was against Leipzig (5-0) at home though. It’s some­thing we wanna cor­rect and get our first win, hope­fully against West Brom, but it’s a dif­fer­ent sen­sa­tion play­ing in front of the Stret­ford End with­out fans, they nor­mally score a goal for us.”</p>
    <p>United’s 3-1 vic­tory at Ever­ton the last time out en­sured the twoweek break was not filled with more spec­u­la­tion over the man­ager’s fu­ture. But in a topsy-turvy sea­son, there are no guar­an­tees the team will build on that win even with West Brom still look­ing for their first win of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>United’s win­less home streak in the league is now six, stretch­ing back to last sea­son, and they have al­ready lost one more game at Old Traf­ford than they did in all of the last cam­paign.</p>
    <p>West Brom should be the per­fect visi­tors with Slaven Bilic’s men hav­ing taken just three points from eight games. But the Bag­gies have won three and drawn one of their last five vis­its to United.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pect a good team who will come and cause prob­lems, but I fo­cus on us and I want to see more of what we’ve been good at. I want to see us dom­i­nate,” said Sol­sk­jaer.</p>
    <p>The United boss also con­firmed that Luke Shaw will be out with an in­jury, while fel­low de­fend­ers Eric Bailly, Mar­cos Rojo and Vic­tor Lin­de­lof are doubts for today’s match.</p>
    <p>He also of­fered his sup­port for Paul Pogba, as the France mid­fielder con­tin­ues to be linked with a move away from United.</p>
    <p>He said: “Paul’s had a dif­fi­cult sea­son last sea­son, had Covid now, those three games he played for France helped.</p>
    <p>“I spoke to Paul and he felt to­wards end of the Por­tu­gal and Swe­den games he felt stronger for it, he played well, they qual­i­fied, I think he’s only go­ing to im­prove.</p>
    <p>“Paul is a very im­por­tant player and very im­por­tant per­son for us and to have him in form and happy is gonna be im­por­tant.”</p>
