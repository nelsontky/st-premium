    <p>The High Court has re­sumed hear­ing a case in which a mother is seek­ing more than $5,000 a month in dam­ages and losses from an in-law who is now in jail for fa­tally stab­bing her son.</p>
    <p>Madam Tham Poh Kwai, 64, said she was de­pen­dent on her son, Spencer Tup­pani, 39, who was stabbed in the chest out­side a Telok Ayer Street cof­fee shop in July 2017 by his fa­ther-in-law, Tan Nam Seng.</p>
    <p>Tan, 72, was sen­tenced last month to 81/ years’ jail af­ter plead</p>
    <p>2 ing guilty to cul­pa­ble homi­cide.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his trial, the court heard that Tan, who was suf­fer­ing from ma­jor de­pres­sive dis­or­der, was up­set with how Mr Tup­pani had treated his daugh­ter, Shyller.</p>
    <p>He also be­lieved that Mr Tup­pani had cheated him of his ship­ping busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Madam Tham is seek­ing at least $5,050 a month from Tan, an amount that court doc­u­ments said in­cluded the monthly main­te­nance that Mr Tup­pani used to give her and her monthly rent since her ac­com­mo­da­tion was pro­vided for by her son.</p>
    <p>In her state­ment of claim filed in Novem­ber last year, Madam Tham al­leged that Tan had “wrong­fully, wil­fully and in­ten­tion­ally as­saulted, at­tacked and stabbed” Mr Tup­pani, re­sult­ing in his death.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­locu­tory judg­ment was ini­tially en­tered in De­cem­ber for Tan to pay the dam­ages to Madam Tham, as he did not en­ter an ap­pear­ance by then.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Tan ap­plied to set aside this judg­ment and en­ter his de­fence, ar­gu­ing then that he was in re­mand when the pa­pers were served on him.</p>
    <p>He said he could com­mu­ni­cate with his so­lic­i­tors only through his daugh­ter, who was away on a fam­ily hol­i­day when the pa­pers and judg­ment were served.</p>
    <p>Madam Tham, who is rep­re­sented by David Na­yar and As­so­ciates, ar­gued against this, claim­ing Tan was seek­ing to de­lay the mat­ter and that he had no vi­able de­fence. She said in an af­fi­davit: “It ap­pears that he (Tan) seeks to make me suf­fer even more for the loss of my son by hav­ing to re­live this en­tire trauma by mak­ing me pro­ceed to trial and prove what he knows is in­de­fea­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>In his de­fence, Tan said that he had “acted in self-de­fence” dur­ing the in­ci­dent as he had “rea­son­ably and hon­estly be­lieved that he was un­der threat” from Mr Tup­pani and his friends.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Tan’s trial, it emerged that, at the time of the in­ci­dent, the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two men had al­ready soured. The court heard that Tan had learnt of Mr Tup­pani’s ex­tra­mar­i­tal re­la­tion­ship and also that the lat­ter had sus­pended an­other daugh­ter, Sherry, from the com­pany he founded. Tan also claimed that Mr Tup­pani owed him $40,000 from a prior busi­ness ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Tan, who is rep­re­sented by United Le­gal Al­liance in the civil law­suit, said that he brought along a knife to “de­fend him­self” when he went to con­front Mr Tup­pani at the cof­fee shop, as he feared be­ing out­num­bered by Mr Tup­pani and his friends.</p>
    <p>He claimed that Mr Tup­pani and his friends had pre­vi­ously been in­volved in crim­i­nal ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Tan said he feared for his safety when Mr Tup­pani “sud­denly stood up” with­out re­sponse or warn­ing while he was try­ing to ini­ti­ate a con­ver­sa­tion with him, and that he stabbed Mr Tup­pani “in an act of self-de­fence”.</p>
    <p>Tan in­sisted that he did not “breach the stan­dard of care owed to the de­ceased as he had acted rea­son­ably in the cir­cum­stances”.</p>
    <p>The civil suit is on­go­ing.</p>
