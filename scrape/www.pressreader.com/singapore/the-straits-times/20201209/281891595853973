    <p>LONDON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has warned that “the sit­u­a­tion is tricky” as he pre­pares to travel to Brus­sels for talks to break the dead­locked ne­go­ti­a­tions over a post-Brexit trade deal.</p>
    <p>“It’s look­ing very, very dif­fi­cult at the mo­ment,” Mr John­son told re­porters yes­ter­day, in his first pub­lic com­ments since an­nounc­ing he will meet Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen in the com­ing days. “Hope springs eter­nal, and I’ll do my best to sort it out if we can,” he said.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing’s date has yet to be de­cided.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union lead­ers will be gath­er­ing for a sum­mit in Brus­sels to­mor­row and, in a sign that the bloc is likely to re­sist mak­ing any sig­nif­i­cant last-minute con­ces­sions to the UK, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel and French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron agreed that Brexit ne­go­ti­a­tions should be kept off the agenda.</p>
    <p>While Mr John­son said he is very hope­ful of se­cur­ing a trade deal, he also warns that there may come a time to aban­don ne­go­ti­a­tions if progress is not made.</p>
    <p>“I’m very hope­ful, but I’ve got to be hon­est with you, I think that the sit­u­a­tion at the mo­ment is very tricky,” he told re­porters in a pooled TV clip.</p>
    <p>“We’re will­ing to en­gage at any level, po­lit­i­cal or oth­er­wise, we’re will­ing to try any­thing,” he said. “But there are just lim­its be­yond which, ob­vi­ously, no sen­si­ble in­de­pen­dent gov­ern­ment or coun­try could go.”</p>
    <p>The two sides are still far apart, with sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ences on the three key is­sues of fish­eries, rules for fair com­pe­ti­tion and the gov­er­nance of any deal, they said in a joint state­ment on Mon­day evening.</p>
    <p>Dis­agree­ments on those sub­jects have dogged the ne­go­ti­a­tions since they be­gan eight months ago.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish side gave a bleak view of the state of play, warn­ing that the ne­go­ti­a­tions may be headed for fail­ure. The Euro­peans were also pes­simistic, with Ir­ish For­eign Min­is­ter Si­mon Coveney warn­ing of mount­ing frus­tra­tion with the Bri­tish ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, UK busi­nesses fired a broad­side at min­is­ters for leav­ing them no time to adapt to post-Brexit rules, even if ne­go­tia­tors do strike a trade deal.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tives and lob­by­ists from in­dus­tries rang­ing from aerospace to law de­cried their sit­u­a­tion in writ­ten state­ments to the Busi­ness, En­ergy and In­dus­trial Strat­egy panel of law­mak­ers ahead of yes­ter­day’s hear­ing on Brexit pre­pared­ness.</p>
    <p>ADS, the aerospace and de­fence lobby, said: “The un­cer­tainty pro­duced by the cur­rent ne­go­ti­a­tions and the lack of time with which to deal with the out­come be­fore the end of the tran­si­tion pe­riod on Dec 31, 2020, is highly dam­ag­ing to busi­ness con­fi­dence and their abil­ity to pre­pare.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s food and drink lobby group said that food im­ports from the EU to the UK will face dis­rup­tion next month due to new Brexit bor­der checks.</p>
    <p>“We can’t be ab­so­lutely cer­tain about the move­ment of food,” Mr Ian Wright, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Food and Drink Fed­er­a­tion, told a panel of law­mak­ers in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day. “This is all about lor­ries with the right pa­per­work get­ting in through a par­tic­u­larly small num­ber of ports.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wright said UK food ex­porters have started los­ing busi­ness in the EU due to Bri­tain’s pend­ing de­par­ture from the bloc’s sin­gle mar­ket and cus­toms union.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, law firms are fac­ing “sig­nif­i­cant is­sues, ad­di­tional costs and a re­duced abil­ity to ser­vice EUbased clients from Jan­uary 2021”, de­spite prepa­ra­tions to deal with them, said the Law So­ci­ety of Eng­land and Wales. Bri­tain’s le­gal ser­vices in­dus­try ac­counts for 552,000 full-time em­ploy­ees and was worth al­most £60 bil­lion (S$106.8 bil­lion) in 2018.</p>
    <p>And cor­ner shops are wor­ried about higher whole­sale prices, avail­abil­ity of stock and a lack of clar­ity over the trad­ing pro­gramme for the bor­der be­tween Great Bri­tain and North­ern Ire­land, said the As­so­ci­a­tion of Con­ve­nience Stores, which rep­re­sents 33,500 lo­cal shops. Most of its mem­bers are small and in­de­pen­dent op­er­a­tors and, there­fore, to­tally re­liant on sup­pli­ers and whole­salers tak­ing the right ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Small and medium-sized busi­nesses are also un­likely to be ready for post-Brexit ac­count­ing regimes, said fi­nan­cial soft­ware firm Sage Group. It called for a “soft land­ing” pe­riod with for­give­ness on faulty fil­ings as busi­nesses adapt to new rules around sales tax and cus­toms.</p>
    <p>THERE ARE LIM­ITS</p>
    <p>I’m very hope­ful, but I’ve got to be hon­est with you, I think that the sit­u­a­tion at the mo­ment is very tricky. We’re will­ing to en­gage at any level, po­lit­i­cal or oth­er­wise, we’re will­ing to try any­thing. But there are just lim­its be­yond which, ob­vi­ously, no sen­si­ble in­de­pen­dent gov­ern­ment or coun­try could go.’’</p>
