    <p>While oth­ers are hold­ing back on new ven­tures be­cause of Covid-19, Mr Melvin Tan and two busi­ness part­ners de­cided to strike out and start a food lo­gis­tics and ware­hous­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic forces com­pa­nies to re­struc­ture and re­think their op­er­a­tions, there has been a surge in de­mand for lo­gis­tics and ware­hous­ing providers, said Mr Tan, 33, who used to work in a multi­na­tional food and bev­er­age firm.</p>
    <p>“Many com­pa­nies will be con­sol­i­dat­ing or ex­pand­ing dur­ing this pe­riod, so that is where we come in,” he said of Flow Ser­vices, which was reg­is­tered last month and will serve mainly small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>Flow cur­rently has four clients. It will fo­cus on help­ing F&B com­pa­nies in var­i­ous as­pects, in­clud­ing ware­hous­ing and stor­age is­sues, and han­dling sup­ply chain and de­liv­ery re­lated in­ef­fi­cien­cies.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which has five staff, also has tie-ups with ex­ist­ing ware­houses to pro­vide stor­age space. For ex­am­ple, some F&B chains might have to close out­lets due to lower foot­fall. Flow can help to trans­port or store their kitchen equip­ment in larger ware­houses at bet­ter rates.</p>
    <p>He and co-founders Marvin Tan, 39, and Michael Wang, 39, pumped about $50,000 into the firm.</p>
    <p>Big­ger com­pa­nies in the sec­tor usu­ally make use of economies of scale to build ef­fi­cient back­end lo­gis­tics op­er­a­tions, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve the smaller play­ers should be able to en­joy good back­end process flows too, if not they will never be able to over­come that hur­dle. Our goal is to help them on their trans­for­ma­tion jour­ney,” he said.</p>
    <p>Also see­ing the in­creas­ing de­mand in the de­liv­ery sec­tor dur­ing the pan­demic is Bri­tish na­tional Ok­sana Scott, 38, who re­vamped her Singapore- reg­is­tered visa pro­cess­ing firm into a courier ser­vice when the cir­cuit breaker started in April.</p>
    <p>Global Singapore, which is also a travel agency, started in 2012, and among its func­tions, spe­cialises in visas for trav­ellers to Rus­sia. As tour and visa ac­tiv­i­ties dwin­dled in early Fe­bru­ary, Mrs Scott de­cided to pro­vide de­liv­ery ser­vices to try to re­tain her five em­ploy­ees, who are lo­cal.</p>
    <p>“We had these two re­li­able couri­ers who were ex­pe­ri­enced, and the rest could help process the or­ders from home,” said Mrs Scott, who re­lo­cated to Singapore in 2010 when her hus­band came here for work.</p>
    <p>She an­tic­i­pated the de­mand for de­liv­ery ser­vices to in­crease, given that many peo­ple would be work­ing from home, and tapped ex­ist­ing clients to let them know of the com­pany’s new ser­vices. “Af­ter we got ap­proval for our guys to be out and about dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, we helped our clients to de­liver things like lap­tops, phones, doc­u­ments and small pack­ages,” she said.</p>
    <p>To cover the salaries of her lo­cal em­ploy­ees, she re­lied on govern­ment as­sis­tance and earn­ings from the courier ser­vices. How­ever, the de­liv­ery ser­vices stopped last month when one of the couri­ers suf­fered a stroke and the other left to join an­other com­pany.</p>
    <p>But Mrs Scott has once again piv­oted to a new fo­cus, and her three re­main­ing staff now do trans­la­tion and le­gal­i­sa­tion ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“We are wait­ing for the courier to re­cover... My em­ploy­ees are part of my fam­ily. I can’t let them go with­out try­ing my hard­est,” she said.</p>
