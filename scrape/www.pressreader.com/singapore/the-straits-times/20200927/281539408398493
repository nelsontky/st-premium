    <p>I am ex­plor­ing Balestier on a DIY her­itage trail, one of 19 such trails around Sin­ga­pore which have been cu­rated by the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB).</p>
    <p>It is easy to do – I pick a neigh­bour­hood that sounds fetch­ing from the NHB her­itage por­tal (roots.sg) and down­load a user-friendly map on my phone.</p>
    <p>I know lit­tle about Balestier, save that it is a bak kut teh hub and a chicken rice en­clave. It is time to be ed­u­cated be­yond mat­ters of the stom­ach, so I choose the most earnest-sound­ing route among those avail­able on this her­itage trail: His­tor­i­cal Land­marks Of Balestier.</p>
    <p>The route be­gins at Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Me­mo­rial Hall, once the South-east Asian head­quar­ters of Dr Sun’s rev­o­lu­tion­ary al­liance, the Tong Meng Hui.</p>
    <p>This colo­nial-era villa in Tai Gin Road looks like a bou­tique ho­tel, but is re­ally a his­tory geek’s dream.</p>
    <p>I learn that in his early 20s, Dr Sun made a pact with three friends to over­throw im­pe­rial China.</p>
    <p>He also won the loy­alty of lo­cal pioneers like Lee Kong Chian and Tan Kah Kee. Fel­low mem­bers of the Tong Meng Hui, they built their busi­ness and phil­an­thropic em­pires in Sin­ga­pore while l ong­ing for China to be lib­er­ated.</p>
    <p>To show his sup­port, Tan even cut off his queue, the long braid of hair syn­ony­mous with the Qing dy­nasty.</p>
    <p>Dr Sun, whose bed­time reading in­cluded a tome on the French Rev­o­lu­tion, be­came known as the father of mod­ern China, serv­ing as its first pro­vi­sional pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The charisma of the man seems to bounce off the walls.</p>
    <p>Still, start­ing the j our­ney with such fire­works is a mis­take. In life, as in pop star Bey­once’s con­certs, open­ing acts have a pur­pose. Suf­fer­ing from its star turn com­ing on too early, many of the land­marks on the Balestier trail pale in com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>I would have stum­bled past some his­tor­i­cally sig­nif­i­cant shop­houses if their elab­o­rate stucco work, full of cherubs and pea­cocks, had not been high­lighted on the map.</p>
    <p>I make a de­tour to check out Shaw Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s for­mer Malay Film Pro­duc­tions stu­dio, where movie stars like P. Ram­lee worked dur­ing the 1950s and 1960s – golden years for Malay cin­ema.</p>
    <p>The gate of the prop­erty is barred with a heavy, rusty chain, the kind that sug­gests large il­le­gal an­i­mals are barely con­tained within. Pri­vately owned, it is not open to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The trou­ble with try­ing to evoke the ghosts of his­tory, even in the agree­able form of a Golden Age su­per­star, is that most peo­ple do not have 3D-mod­el­ling soft­ware in their heads.</p>
    <p>It is hard to imag­ine that Balestier, named af­ter Joseph Balestier, the first Amer­i­can con­sul in Sin­ga­pore, used to be a sug­ar­cane plan­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the site of the for­mer movie stu­dio – which sounds fas­ci­nat­ing on pa­per – is as ap­peal­ing as a dead dodo.</p>
    <p>But my in­ter­est re­vives at Goh Chor Tua Pek Kong Tem­ple, which has a wayang or Chi­nese opera stage in its vicin­ity. Built more than 110 years ago, it is one of three sur­viv­ing wayang stages in Sin­ga­pore. It re­sem­bles a red, large-screen TV.</p>
    <p>I pause when I pass by Loy Kee Best Chicken Rice in Balestier Road and not be­cause it is al­most lunchtime.</p>
    <p>Dis­played be­hind glass is a pair of his-and-her chop­pers, used by the found­ing hawker cou­ple to por­tion out slices of chicken.</p>
    <p>Part of NHB’s show­cas­ing of lo­cal her­itage, it is gim­micky, but raises a smile. You gotta love a mar­ket­ing plan that in­volves Ah Ma and Ah Kong’s kitchen­ware.</p>
