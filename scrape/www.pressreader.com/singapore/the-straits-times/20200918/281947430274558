    <p>In the small Aus­tralian coun­try town of Narrabri in north­ern New South Wales, an in­tense bat­tle is rag­ing be­tween the lo­cals, the state gov­ern­ment and a big en­ergy com­pany.</p>
    <p>Within weeks, the New South Wales gov­ern­ment could ap­prove the A$3.6 bil­lion (S$3.57 bil­lion) Narrabri Gas Project, which de­vel­oper San­tos, a ma­jor oil and gas firm, says will boost en­ergy se­cu­rity in the state.</p>
    <p>At stake is the ques­tion of the grow­ing role of nat­u­ral gas in meet­ing the world’s en­ergy needs and its im­pact in fu­elling cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>For years, en­ergy firms and gov­ern­ments have pro­moted gas as be­ing bet­ter for the cli­mate than coal and oil, since gas pro­duces less car­bon emis­sions. Thus, it has been pitched as a “tran­si­tion fuel” to buy economies time while they switch to green en­ergy sources.</p>
    <p>This prompted con­sid­er­able switch­ing from coal to gas. Sin­ga­pore, for in­stance, switched to gas for much of its en­ergy needs, and, in do­ing so, cut green­house gas emis­sions and re­duced air pol­lu­tion. With no nat­u­ral re­sources of its own, and wind and so­lar not yet at a suf­fi­cient level of ef­fi­ciency to be vi­able, nat­u­ral gas seemed the best of the avail­able op­tions to meet the coun­try’s grow­ing en­ergy needs.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, how­ever, the switch to wider use of gas has led to a rapid growth of gas and in­vest­ment in new gas pro­duc­tion to feed boom­ing ex­port mar­kets, es­pe­cially in Asia.</p>
    <p>Liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas (LNG) pro­duc­tion has soared in the past two decades and shows lit­tle sign of slow­ing down.</p>
    <p>Rather than mak­ing greater ef­fort to mit­i­gate the de­mand for en­ergy through con­ser­va­tion and en­ergy-ef­fi­ciency drives, or push the devel­op­ment of non-car­bon and re­new­able al­ter­na­tives, the ready avail­abil­ity of gas, and its much-pro­moted im­age as a cleaner tran­si­tion fuel, has un­der­mined much-needed ef­forts to curb car­bon diox­ide (CO2) emis­sions over­all.</p>
    <p>This is alarm­ing cli­mate sci­en­tists and the United Na­tions, who say the world is warm­ing quickly be­cause of grow­ing fos­sil fuel emis­sions. This is driv­ing costly weather ex­tremes and ac­cel­er­at­ing sea level rise.</p>
    <p>The so­lu­tion? All na­tions must quickly shift to cleaner sources of en­ergy and life­styles that cut de­pen­dence on fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>That doesn’t mean switch­ing off the lights and shut­ting down ex­ist­ing gas plants. But it does mean re­al­is­ing the grow­ing threat from cli­mate change and act­ing to speed up the tran­si­tion to a greener world.</p>
    <p>The green en­ergy tech­nol­ogy to tran­si­tion away from fos­sil fu­els is avail­able. So­lar and wind power are on a par or cheaper than coal and gas plants, and bat­tery stor­age is get­ting cheaper by the year.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric ve­hi­cles are get­ting cheaper too and are far cleaner.</p>
    <p>We know how to build far more en­ergy-ef­fi­cient build­ings and even cre­ate low-emis­sions ce­ment and steel (both sec­tors are big green­house gas pol­luters).</p>
    <p>Take-up at scale of all these op­tions would be boosted if gov­ern­ment, busi­nesses and con­sumers were in­cen­tivised to do so, in much the same way in­cen­tives have been given to pro­mote the devel­op­ment of gas, so ex­perts have sug­gested.</p>
    <p>Restor­ing en­vi­ron­ments such as wet­lands and forests are vi­tal so­lu­tions, too, be­cause they soak up CO2, the main green­house gas.</p>
    <p>Some gov­ern­ments are al­ready mak­ing greater in­vest­ment in these ar­eas as part of Covid-19 eco­nomic res­cue plans. But a global green deal could speed this up.</p>
    <p>What’s needed is global po­lit­i­cal will and an end to the view that mas­sive, and of­ten sub­sidised, fos­sil fuel ex­port in­dus­tries, es­pe­cially gas, are good for economies and the planet. They aren’t.</p>
    <p>As for­mer Aus­tralian chief sci­en­tist Penny Sack­ett wrote in a re­cent com­men­tary: “To­day, when the enor­mous hu­man, eco­nomic and eco­log­i­cal costs of even</p>
    <p>1.1 deg C of warm­ing are so clear, when prices of re­new­able en­ergy have plum­meted, and sev­eral non-fos­sil en­ergy stor­age op­tions are avail­able, gas is not a tran­si­tion fuel to a safe cli­mate.</p>
    <p>“That ship has sailed.”</p>
    <p>CLEANER, BUT NOT ENOUGH</p>
    <p>Gas is cleaner burn­ing and less pol­lut­ing than coal and oil.</p>
    <p>But as cli­mate sci­en­tists and en­ergy an­a­lysts point out, it is still a fos­sil fuel and pro­duces plenty of heat-trap­ping CO2 emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Last year, the com­bus­tion of nat­u­ral gas was the fastest-grow­ing source of CO2 in the at­mos­phere, ac­cord­ing to the Global Car­bon Project, which analy­ses fos­sil fuel emis­sion trends.</p>
    <p>Oil still has the largest share of the global en­ergy mix at 33.1 per cent as of last year, ac­cord­ing to the BP Sta­tis­ti­cal Re­view of World En­ergy.</p>
    <p>Coal is the sec­ond-largest fuel but lost share last year to ac­count for 27 per cent, while nat­u­ral gas rose to a record high of 24.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency (IEA), global gas pro­duc­tion for in­dus­try and power gen­er­a­tion dou­bled be­tween 1990 and last year.</p>
    <p>Global LNG pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity, led by Aus­tralia, Qatar and the United States, will tre­ble to more than 600 bil­lion cu­bic m by 2022 com­pared with 2002, say the IEA and Korea En­ergy Eco­nom­ics In­sti­tute in a joint re­port last year.</p>
    <p>The IEA says that while global gas de­mand will dip this year be­cause of the pan­demic, growth will re­sume from next year with strong de­mand from Asia for the rest of the decade, even as re­new­able en­ergy con­tin­ues to grow as a cleaner source of en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Global CO2 emis­sions reached an­other record last year, mak­ing it that much harder to keep warm­ing to well be­low 2 deg C and ide­ally 1.5 deg C as set out un­der the 2015</p>
    <p>Paris Cli­mate Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The world has al­ready warmed</p>
    <p>1.1 deg C since pre-in­dus­trial times, and the UN In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Panel on Cli­mate Change says we have this decade to make deep cuts to car­bon emis­sions to limit warm­ing.</p>
    <p>But present in­vest­ment plans for new fos­sil fuel pro­duc­tion make that pretty much im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>A 2019 study led by the Swedish En­vi­ron­ment In­sti­tute shows that gov­ern­ments are plan­ning to pro­duce about 50 per cent more fos­sil fu­els by 2030 than would be con­sis­tent with a 2 deg C world and 120 per cent more than would be con­sis­tent with a 1.5 deg C world. Mean­ing, we’re far off course in avoid dan­ger­ous cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>To feed global de­mand, many new gas projects are planned or in devel­op­ment in Aus­tralia, the US, Africa and else­where.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Wood­side En­ergy and its part­ners are plan­ning a ma­jor ex­pan­sion of gas pro­duc­tion in Bur­rup Hub, in north-west West­ern Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Just one of the projects planned for the devel­op­ment, an ex­ten­sion to the ex­ist­ing North West Shelf Project, would emit an es­ti­mated 4.4 bil­lion tonnes of CO2 and other emis­sions over its 50-year life­time – or roughly eight times Aus­tralia’s green­house gas emis­sions for last year, Wood­side says. The state gov­ern­ment has re­ceived more than 20,000 sub­mis­sions on the project and the vast ma­jor­ity are strongly op­posed to it.</p>
    <p>The New South Wales gov­ern­ment, though, has al­ready sig­nalled sup­port, even though the project would re­lease about five mil­lion tonnes of CO2 a year to pro­duce gas for sale – about the an­nual emis­sions of 1.1 mil­lion cars.</p>
    <p>None of this fazes the fed­eral rul­ing coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son and En­ergy Min­is­ter An­gus Tay­lor are ar­dent back­ers of a “gas-led re­cov­ery” for the na­tion, sup­port­ing a mix of re­new­able en­ergy and gas hubs, de­spite the cli­mate risks.</p>
    <p>PRO­DUC­TION EMIS­SIONS</p>
    <p>While gas might be cleaner than coal or oil, pro­duc­ing it has some lit­tle-known down­sides.</p>
    <p>When look­ing at the en­tire pro­duc­tion life cy­cle, gas is more pol­lut­ing than you might think.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent gas fields have dif­fer­ent lev­els of CO2, which has to be extracted from the raw gas stream. This un­wanted CO2 is usu­ally vented straight into the air.</p>
    <p>To pro­duce LNG, sig­nif­i­cant amounts of en­ergy are used to chill the gas for trans­port, fur­ther dent­ing the cli­mate ad­van­tage. Then there is meth­ane. Flammable meth­ane is the main com­po­nent of nat­u­ral gas and it is also a far more pow­er­ful green­house gas than CO2.</p>
    <p>It can warm the earth 28 times as much as the same mass of CO2 over a 100-year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Meth­ane lev­els in the air have grown 2.6 times since 1750 and that in­crease has contribute­d about 23 per cent to the ad­di­tional warm­ing ac­cu­mu­lated in the lower at­mos­phere since that year, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est global meth­ane bud­get re­leased in July, also by the Global Car­bon Project.</p>
    <p>Meth­ane also comes from agri­cul­ture, such as belch­ing live­stock and wet­lands.</p>
    <p>But fos­sil fu­els are a large and quickly grow­ing source, es­pe­cially due to nat­u­ral gas ex­trac­tion and a vast net­work of leaky gas pipe­lines.</p>
    <p>GREEN HY­DRO­GEN</p>
    <p>So what’s the al­ter­na­tive to gas?</p>
    <p>In a decade or so, a new in­dus­try could start to re­place nat­u­ral gas, and gov­ern­ments al­ready see the po­ten­tial: green hy­dro­gen.</p>
    <p>Al­though not new, the dif­fer­ence now is that the hy­dro­gen pro­duc­tion pro­cess has be­come cheaper and prices are set to fall fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Flammable hy­dro­gen can use much of the ex­ist­ing pipe­lines and trans­port net­works. It can be burned to gen­er­ate elec­tric­ity, power cars or used as a heat source for in­dus­try, such as glass, steel and ce­ment mak­ing. It pro­duces no pol­lu­tion when burned and it can be shipped to en­ergy-hun­gry na­tions.</p>
    <p>All you need is lots of sun or wind, or both, to make it.</p>
    <p>Green hy­dro­gen is pro­duced us­ing re­new­able en­ergy to split wa­ter into hy­dro­gen and oxy­gen. Rapid ad­vances in the de­vices that split the wa­ter, and fall­ing prices for so­lar pan­els and wind tur­bines, are driv­ing this in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, Aus­tralia has mega re­new­able en­ergy and hy­dro­gen projects in plan­ning stages, with the idea to ship the hy­dro­gen to Asia. Eu­rope, the US and Chile are also push­ing ahead with green hy­dro­gen, with Ger­many re­cently ear­mark­ing €9 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$14.4 bil­lion) for the ex­pan­sion of hy­dro­gen ca­pac­ity at home and abroad as part of its coron­avirus re­cov­ery pack­age.</p>
    <p>The IEA says hy­dro­gen’s time has come. Cli­mate sci­en­tists agree but say it should be pro­duced us­ing only green en­ergy and not fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>“Clean hy­dro­gen is cur­rently en­joy­ing un­prece­dented po­lit­i­cal and busi­ness mo­men­tum,” the IEA said in a re­port last year.</p>
    <p>“Hy­dro­gen and hy­dro­gen-based fu­els can trans­port en­ergy from re­new­ables over long dis­tances – from re­gions with abun­dant so­lar and wind re­sources, such as Aus­tralia or Latin Amer­ica, to en­ergy-hun­gry cities thou­sands of kilo­me­tres away.”</p>
    <p>That is po­ten­tially at­trac­tive for ma­jor en­ergy im­porters in Asia, such as Sin­ga­pore, South Korea and Ja­pan, as they try to cut air pol­lu­tion and green­house gas emis­sions.</p>
