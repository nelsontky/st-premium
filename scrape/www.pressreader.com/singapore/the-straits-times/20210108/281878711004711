    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s po­lice chief has apol­o­gised amid an out­pour­ing of grief and anger over the death of an adopted child in a coun­try with a long his­tory of adop­tion, both do­mes­ti­cally and abroad.</p>
    <p>The 16-month-old girl, who the me­dia has iden­ti­fied by just her given name, Jeong-in, died on Oct 13 af­ter be­ing taken to hospi­tal with in­juries.</p>
    <p>“I deeply apol­o­gise for fail­ing to pro­tect the life of a young child who suf­fered abuse,” com­mis­sioner gen­eral Kim Chang-yong of the Korean Na­tional Po­lice Agency told a news con­fer­ence on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The apol­ogy came a day af­ter Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in ex­pressed re­gret over the girl’s fate and called on the au­thor­i­ties to make the wel­fare of adopted chil­dren a pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim vowed to re­form the re­sponse to child abuse and he also re­moved the l ocal po­lice chief from his post.</p>
    <p>The me­dia said re­ports had been lodged with the po­lice about the girl be­fore her death.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim said the case was be­ing in­ves­ti­gated, but said noth­ing about any charges.</p>
    <p>He did not com­ment on me­dia re­ports that the adop­tive par­ents were be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim Hyun-taek, pres­i­dent of the Korean Pe­di­atric So­ci­ety, said mur­der charges should be brought against the adop­tive par­ents, cit­ing “clear signs of i nten­tional trauma”. The pae­di­a­tri­cian of 20 years pointed to the girl’s rup­tured pan­creas as a key in­di­ca­tion of wil­ful in­jury, as op­posed to an ac­ci­den­tal fall as claimed by the adop­tive par­ents.</p>
    <p>“The pan­creas is lo­cated deep in the ab­domen, mak­ing it a highly un­com­mon or­gan to be in­jured,” he said.</p>
    <p>Its in­jury is as­so­ci­ated with more se­ri­ous ac­ci­dents such as a ve­hi­cle col­li­sion or a long fall, he added.</p>
    <p>“Such case of a rup­tured pan­creas seen in the tod­dler is very un­likely to be a re­sult of an ac­ci­den­tal in­jury.”</p>
    <p>Find­ings from the au­topsy also showed the tod­dler had sus­tained ab­dom­i­nal dam­age a few days prior to her death.</p>
    <p>“This means that they had al­ready in­flicted on the tod­dler sim­i­lar kinds of ab­dom­i­nal in­juries days be­fore, and then again the day she died,” Dr Lim said.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Mon­day, the Korean Women Lawyers As­so­ci­a­tion also pro­posed that the case be re­viewed as a po­ten­tial mur­der.</p>
    <p>The tod­dler died about eight months af­ter she was adopted in Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>When she was taken to an emer­gency room at a western Seoul hospi­tal on Oct 13, she was al­ready in a state of car­diac ar­rest.</p>
    <p>She was badly bruised, with her ribs frac­tured and stom­ach bloated from in­ter­nal bleed­ing, ac­cord­ing to the hospi­tal records.</p>
    <p>Her death cer­tifi­cate read ab­dom­i­nal trauma.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions, pros­e­cu­tors in­dicted the adop­tive mother on charges of child abuse homi­cide, and her adop­tive fa­ther for child ne­glect.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim lamented the lack of po­lice ac­tion de­spite three sep­a­rate re­ports of child abuse filed by a day­care cen­tre as well as a pae­di­a­tri­cian who ex­am­ined her.</p>
    <p>The hash­tag “Sorry, Jeong-in” has trended on South Korean Twit­ter this week and sev­eral ac­tors and singers, in­clud­ing a mem­ber of top boy band BTS, Jimin, posted the hash­tag on their so­cial net­works and made do­na­tions to child­care agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The case has shone a spot­light on child abuse. The Korean Women Lawyers As­so­ci­a­tion said 28 adopted chil­dren had died in 2018 alone from abuse, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Cen­tre for the Rights of the Child, and 80 per cent of the child abuse takes place within the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>South Korea has been a source of ba­bies for adop­tion by peo­ple abroad since the 1950-1953 Korean War, es­pe­cially to the United States. Adop­tion is also rel­a­tively com­mon do­mes­ti­cally.</p>
