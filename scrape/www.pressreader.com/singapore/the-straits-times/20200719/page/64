        Invest | The Sunday Times Sunday, July 19, 2020 | B16 What the pandemic did to condo sales in New York Skyline Tower, a 237m l uxury condo building in Long Island City that looms over western Queens, was built to break records.
It is the tallest building in the borough; the most ambitious, with sales projected to exceed US$1 billion (S$1.4 billion). In February, the developers claimed it was the fastest selling, with contracts signed on a quarter of its 802 units.
But even before the coronaviru­s gripped New York in March, the condo market in the city was softening. And as the sales and rental markets cautiously reopen, many of the surefire bets that fuelled the last cycle of developmen­t are being thrown into question.
Will buyers still pay top dollar for proximity to Manhattan offices they rarely use? Can developers sell tiny units in big buildings, many without outdoor space, now that building amenities are closed? With so many options on the market, what will a shrinking pool of buyers and renters choose?
There may be no better proving ground for which projects will succeed or fail i n a post-Covid-19 world than what is being built in these once largely industrial neighbourh­oods.
The quarantine in March knocked marketing and building timelines off track. Some builders are changing apartment floor plans to make way for home offices and decontamin­ation rooms, and rethinking amenities that no longer make sense in close quarters. To spur sales, new discounts and promotions, like rent-to-own programmes more commonly seen after the 2008 recession, are now cropping up. pushback and concern over gentrifica­tion ended those plans.
Ms Nancy Packes, the principal of Nancy Packes Data Services, noted that if not for the pandemic, the new condos in Long Island City would have sold in due time.
The slow-selling condos could also be listed as rentals since the apartments there are generally smaller and less expensive than the ones in Manhattan.
Despite unemployme­nt numbers soaring, the buyers and renters targeted in these new projects tend to have more job security, she said.
Market observers are looking for answers at the 802-unit Skyline Tower, which has more than four times as many condos as the next largest building in the neighbourh­ood. Since the quarantine began in March, there have been just six new contracts signed, for a total of about 30 per cent of units sold, said Mr Eric Benaim, chief executive of Modern Spaces, which is leading sales at the project.
But he said there is pent-up demand, much of it from local buyers, who have been waiting for a chance to see the sales gallery in person. Prices range from about US$680,000 for studios as small as 450 sq ft to US$4 million for a highfloor three-bedroom. More than half of the units are two-bedrooms or larger. Occupancy was going to begin around October, but may now be pushed to January.
Ms Stella Liu, head of sales and marketing for Risland US Holdings, one of the Skyline developers, said the prices were warranted because of the views of Manhattan, subway access and amenities, including a 23m indoor pool. But use of the shared amenities will depend on state guidance for at least the next several months, if not longer.
The lasting impact of Covid-19 is not lost on buyers. Mr Gary Hirshfield, an ophthalmol­ogist who works in Queens, moved with his wife Stacey Kruger, also an ophthalmol­ogist, into a three-bedroom penthouse at Galerie, a nearby condo project, at the end of last year. Now he is having second thoughts.
“Today, if I could get my money out, I’d consider it,” said the 58-year-old. For the cost of his 1,690 sq ft apartment, he said he could have bought a 5,000 sq ft house with some land in the suburbs. But Long Island City appealed to him because of the restaurant scene, its proximity to Manhattan and the high-end fitness centre in the building (now closed to residents). He still believes in the value of the project, but doesn’t know when he’ll feel safe enough to use the gym again. ing design changes that will add value, and gimmicks,” Mr Smith said, but some builders are already thinking about the permanent changes the pandemic will have on buyer preference­s.
Mr Adrian Lupu, an agent with Nest Seekers Internatio­nal, said an upcoming 70-unit project in the Dutch Kills area of Long Island City was originally slated to have a movie theatre theme, to capitalise on the nearby Kaufman Astoria film studios. Instead, they will rebrand the building as a “sanctuary”, with air purifiers and an emphasis on wellness.
At Townhouse on the Park, an upcoming 75-unit project where rents range from US$7,200 to US$8,250 a month, almost all the apartments will have private outdoor space – a feature the developer, GDC Properties, will be sure to emphasise, now that so many are stuck at home.
The bigger challenge for many developers will be competitio­n, both from completed buildings and upcoming projects. There are roughly 1,500 new apartments available for sale in Long Island City, including units not yet being marketed.
And there were already signs of a slowdown in the borough’s condo market before Covid-19. On average, 367 condos were sold per quarter in the last two years in Queens, down almost 14 per cent from two years earlier.
Several developers had also been emboldened last year by the prospect of Amazon bringing a second headquarte­rs – and a presumed wave of high-income residents – to the area, but community Some builders are changing apartment floor plans to make way for home offices and decontamin­ation rooms, and rethinking amenities that no longer make sense in close quarters. To spur sales, new discounts and promotions, like rent-to-own programmes more commonly seen after the 2008 recession, are now cropping up. REBRANDING PROJECTS “There is simply no demand for two-bedroom apartments that are 950 sq ft and go for US$1.5 million,” said Mr Patrick Smith, an agent with Corcoran who specialise­s in Long Island City, referring to the recent trend towards units with less square footage but higher-end finishes. The average size of a twobedroom apartment in Manhattan is 1,344 sq ft.
He considers himself lucky that his upcoming projects are still in the planning stages, which means the developers have time to change their layouts to react to the coronaviru­s. At one upcoming project, the ubiquitous open floor plan has been modified to create an oldfashion­ed foyer – a decontamin­ation area of sorts before entering the living room. At another, some kitchens will shrink to make way for offices, now that so many people are working from home.
