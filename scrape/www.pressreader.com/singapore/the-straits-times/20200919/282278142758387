    <p>NEW YORK • Winged Foot has hum­bled many great golfers in the past but Justin Thomas was not in­tim­i­dated by its bru­tal rep­u­ta­tion as he breezed through the open­ing round of the US Open on Thurs­day with barely a scratch.</p>
    <p>The US Open is known as the tough­est test in golf but for world No. 3 Thomas, his day looked more like a walk in the park as a five-un­der 65 marked his low­est firstround score in a Ma­jor and gave him a one-shot lead.</p>
    <p>“I just was stick­ing to my rou­tine and play­ing ev­ery shot, as op­posed to get­ting ahead of my­self,” said the Amer­i­can, who closed with a 25-foot birdie putt and needed only 28 putts on Winged Foot’s wildly un­du­lat­ing and speedy greens.</p>
    <p>“This is one of the bet­ter rounds I’ve had tee to green. It’s one of those where it’s kind of like, next thing you know, you make the putt on No. 18, you’re done for the day.”</p>
    <p>The course, in Mamaroneck, New York, has long had a rep­u­ta­tion for be­ing a tough one. When Aus­tralian Ge­off Ogilvy won in 2006, his win­ning score was 285, five over par. When Amer­i­can Hale Ir­win won with a 287 in 1974, the tour­na­ment was dubbed “The Mas­sacre at Winged Foot”.</p>
    <p>Mea­sur­ing 7,477 yards, Winged Foot is a par-70 with just two parfives. It has a bru­tal fin­ish­ing stretch of five straight par-fours, none less than 425 yards.</p>
    <p>Thomas, who also fired the low­est US Open round ever at Winged Foot, be­gan with a birdie, took a bo­gey at the par-three third, an­swered with an eight-foot birdie at the par-four sixth and then reeled off three con­sec­u­tive birdies start­ing at the par-five ninth be­fore his im­pres­sive fi­nal putt.</p>
    <p>He has just one top-10 fin­ish in five US Open starts but ar­rived at Winged Foot brim­ming with con­fi­dence as he is fresh off a 2019-20 sea­son in which he earned three PGA Tour wins and fin­ished run­ner-up at the Tour Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>The US Open is de­fined by nar­row fair­ways, thick rough and firm greens but Thomas was un­rat­tled and took full ad­van­tage of his early tee time as there was lit­tle wind to deal with and the course was softer.</p>
    <p>“You’ve still got to hit the shots,” he said. “My game plan go­ing into the week is that, yeah, I need to re­spect the course, but if I’m driv­ing it well and play­ing well, I do need to try to make some birdies, and that’s ex­actly what we did to­day.”</p>
    <p>Although Thomas, whose lone Ma­jor ti­tle came at the 2017 PGA Cham­pi­onship, was able to get off to a fast start, he does not feel like he has a big ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>“As great of a round and fun as it was, it’s over with now, and I need to get over it be­cause I’ve got 54 more holes to try to play well,” he said.</p>
    <p>He was one shot clear of Bel­gian Thomas Pi­eters, Amer­i­can Matthew Wolff and Ry­der Cup team­mate Pa­trick Reed, who aced the par-three sev­enth.</p>
    <p>Four-time Ma­jor cham­pion Rory McIl­roy, in his first start since be­com­ing a fa­ther, was part of a group of three two shots off the lead.</p>
    <p>Veter­ans Phil Mick­el­son and Tiger Woods were among a slew of big-name play­ers well off the pace.</p>
    <p>Mick­el­son, who suf­fered one of</p>
    <p>his record six US Open run­ner-up fin­ishes at Winged Foot in 2006 and en­tered this week seek­ing the fi­nal piece of the ca­reer Grand Slam, birdied his first two holes be­fore strug­gling to a nine-over 79.</p>
    <p>“It’s dis­ap­point­ing, I just played</p>
    <p>Top-10 fin­ish in five US Open starts for first-round leader Justin Thomas.</p>
    <p>ter­ri­ble,” he said af­ter card­ing nine bo­geys and a dou­ble-bo­gey.</p>
    <p>Woods (73) made a bo­gey at No. 17 and ended his round with a dou­ble-bo­gey as his ap­proach rolled off the front of the green be­fore he chun­ked a chip shot and missed a break­ing bo­gey save.</p>
    <p>Also far from con­tention were PGA Tour Player of the Year Dustin Johnson (73), holder Gary Wood­land (74) and reign­ing PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner Collin Morikawa (76).</p>
