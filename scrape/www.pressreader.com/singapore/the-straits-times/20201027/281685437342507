    <p>Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion yes­ter­day called for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to sack two Cabi­net min­is­ters whom they ac­cused of be­ing the mas­ter­minds be­hind a failed at­tempt to de­clare a state of emer­gency in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) lead­ers want Se­nior Min­is­ter for Econ­omy Azmin Ali and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter Hamzah Zain­ud­din re­moved from the Cabi­net. The op­po­si­tion did not say how it con­cluded that the two men were be­hind the bid to get the Malaysian King to de­clare an emer­gency.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, re­jected the gov­ern­ment’s pro­posal to de­clare an emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Azmin and Datuk Seri Hamzah were the same men ac­cused by PH of be­ing the key plan­ners who caused the col­lapse of the Ma­hathir Mo­hamad ad­min­is­tra­tion in late Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“To re­set the scene, Prime Min­is­ter Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin should make Par­lia­ment the av­enue for gen­uine co­op­er­a­tion, con­sul­ta­tion and co-gov­ern­ing with the op­po­si­tion for the greater good of the na­tion i n this time of Covid-19 cri­sis,” wrote Mr Liew Chin Tong, for­mer deputy min­is­ter in the PH gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“To smoothen the process, it would be very help­ful if Muhyid­din of­fers the heads of Hamzah Zain­ud­din and Azmin Ali,” he wrote on his blog.</p>
    <p>“With the de­par­tures of Hamzah and Azmin from the Cabi­net, co­op­er­a­tion among the gov­ern­ing PN (Perikatan Na­sional) coali­tion par­ties will im­prove, and a friend­lier milieu for a gen­uine bi­par­ti­san work­ing re­la­tion­ship with the op­po­si­tion in a time of Covid-19 cri­sis would be fos­tered.”</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat MP Wong Chen has also called for Mr Muhyid­din to ei­ther re­sign or sack the two min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>“If he (Muhyid­din) doesn’t re­sign, then at least two of his se­nior min­is­ters should be sacked. We know that the Prime Min­is­ter has not been in the best of health for some time, and there is per­sis­tent talk that he is be­ing in­flu­enced by these two se­nior min­is­ters,” Mr Wong wrote in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>A sec­tion of Umno, a party al­lied to Mr Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional al­liance, is also sus­pi­cious of Mr Azmin and Mr Hamzah, the Prime Min­is­ter’s two se­nior lieu­tenants in Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia. Mr Muhyid­din is Ber­satu’s pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Umno Supreme Coun­cil mem­ber Puad Zarkashi claimed that Ber­satu lead­ers had pointed the fin­ger at Mr Azmin and Mr Hamzah dur­ing an emo­tional meet­ing at the Prime Min­is­ter’s res­i­dence on Sun­day night, fol­low­ing the King’s re­jec­tion of the emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Is it true that they had ill-ad­vised Muhyid­din?” he asked on his Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din had at­tempted to con­vince the King last Fri­day to de­clare a state of emer­gency, os­ten­si­bly to al­low the gov­ern­ment to fo­cus on fight­ing the pan­demic amid a surge in the num­ber of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>How­ever, crit­ics said the plan to call an emer­gency was a ploy by the Premier to re­main in of­fice, given that his ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity would be tested in Par­lia­ment when it meets next month to de­bate the bud­get.</p>
    <p>If the bud­get is not passed, the gov­ern­ment would col­lapse, trig­ger­ing snap polls.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu vice-pres­i­dent Mohd Rafiq Naizamo­hideen said that calls for Mr Muhyid­din to step down “clearly go against and dis­re­spect the King’s de­cree for all par­ties to stop pol­i­tick­ing”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Umno Youth has called for a truce among po­lit­i­cal par­ties to fo­cus on the fight against the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Politi­cians should... stop play­ing pol­i­tics that could de­stroy the na­tion and bur­den the rakyat (peo­ple),” said Umno Youth chief Asyraf Wa­jdi Dusuki.</p>
