    <p>The United States hit 200,000 coro­n­avirus deaths on Tues­day, an al­most un­think­able mile­stone whose ar­rival un­der­scored the fail­ure of Amer­i­can lead­er­ship to con­tain the virus through spring and sum­mer, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>They also warned that with schools re­open­ing and out­door gath­er­ings soon to be driven in­doors by the com­ing cold, there could be more surges on the way.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal tri­als for three vac­cine can­di­dates are un­der way, but it will take some time be­fore vac­cines will be widely dis­trib­uted, they added, de­spite Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s sug­ges­tion that a vac­cine could be ready by election day on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery one of the 200,000 Amer­i­cans killed by Covid-19 is a tragedy, and most of these deaths did not have to hap­pen,” said Dr Tom Frieden, former di­rec­tor of the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion.</p>
    <p>“There is no fairy-tale end­ing to this pan­demic – not even a vac­cine,” he added on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he and oth­ers ad­vo­cated wear­ing a mask, con­tin­ued so­cial dis­tanc­ing, more strate­gic test­ing, rapid iso­la­tion, com­plete con­tact trac­ing and sup­port­ive quar­an­tine to save lives and liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Dr Frieden ar­gued in a com­men­tary last week that while the national pos­i­tiv­ity rate has dropped – from a high of 20 per cent to 5 per cent now – Amer­ica is also los­ing the abil­ity to track the virus, with less test­ing over­all and no re­li­able in­for­ma­tion on who is be­ing tested.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on Tues­day de­fended his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s han­dling of the virus, blam­ing China for not stop­ping the virus at its bor­ders and say­ing that the death toll could have been as high as 2.5 mil­lion with­out his lead­er­ship, he told re­porters on the South Lawn at the White House.</p>
    <p>“You could have had a num­ber that was sub­stan­tially more. With all that be­ing said, we shouldn’t have had any­body,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump ap­peared to be re­fer­ring to an Im­pe­rial Col­lege London model in March that pre­dicted 2.2 mil­lion deaths in a worst-case sce­nario of an un­con­trolled spread due to to­tal government in­ac­tion – a low bar to clear.</p>
    <p>Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity epi­demi­ol­o­gist Jen­nifer Nuzzo said: “The US rep­re­sents less than 5 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, but more than 20 per cent of Covid-19 deaths. It didn’t have to be this way.</p>
    <p>“Other coun­tries used their re­sources to keep cases and deaths from ac­cel­er­at­ing. The US had these re­sources and more, but did not make use of them.”</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s more than seven mil­lion coro­n­avirus cases and over 200,000 deaths ac­count for more than a fifth of the world’s to­tal.</p>
    <p>In a Twit­ter post, Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den slammed com­ments by Mr Trump at a rally in Ohio on Mon­day that the virus af­fected “vir­tu­ally no­body”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said: “We lost 200,000 mums and dads, sons and daugh­ters, friends and co-work­ers.</p>
    <p>“And not a sin­gle one of them was a no­body.”</p>
    <p>Be­tween 700 and 800 Amer­i­cans are dy­ing from Covid-19 daily, ac­cord­ing to the Covid Track­ing Pro­ject, down from the mid-Au­gust peak of around 1,200 daily deaths and all-time high of more than 2,000 in April.</p>
    <p>But the In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion (IHME) at the Univer­sity of Washington projects a most likely sce­nario of 380,000 to­tal deaths by Jan 1 next year, a num­ber that can be low­ered to 262,000 deaths if al­most ev­ery­one wears masks. If so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules ease, the deaths could shoot up to 428,000, it pre­dicts.</p>
    <p>“Sea­son­al­ity is the key driver, along with de­clined vig­i­lance from in­di­vid­u­als as we head into the win­ter,” said IHME di­rec­tor Chris Mur­ray, cit­ing data from cities in the south­ern hemi­sphere and strong sea­sonal pat­terns in pneu­mo­nia trends.</p>
    <p>“As we pre­dicted many months ago, the fall-win­ter surge has be­gun in Europe. It hasn’t yet kicked in in the US to the same de­gree... but ev­ery­thing that we see in the data tells us there will be that win­ter surge,” he added in an in­ter­view with the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies this week.</p>
