    <p>UNITED STATES</p>
    <p>Sev­eral US cities, in­clud­ing Port­land and Oak­land, had closed off roads tem­porar­ily dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic to help fa­cil­i­tate so­cial dis­tanc­ing among pedes­tri­ans, with some even in­tro­duc­ing per­ma­nent changes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the mayor of Seat­tle an­nounced in May that the city will per­ma­nently close off about 30km of its roads to al­most all ve­hi­cle traf­fic. The se­lected roads are in ar­eas with lit­tle open space, low rates of car own­er­ship and along routes to es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The Seat­tle Depart­ment of Trans­porta­tion said it wants to build a trans­port sys­tem that en­ables peo­ple of all ages to cy­cle and walk across the city.</p>
    <p>ATHENS</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal of Greece started on a “Great Walk of Athens” trial in June, un­der which it will re­al­lo­cate space on roads from cars to pedes­tri­ans and bikes. This will even­tu­ally form a route – re­ported to be 6.8km long – that will run through his­tor­i­cal neigh­bour­hoods in the city. It will ini­tially be done through tem­po­rary ad­just­ments such as colour­ing of roads and in­stalling equip­ment like benches, be­fore per­ma­nent changes are made.</p>
    <p>LON­DON</p>
    <p>Lon­don Mayor Sadiq Khan an­nounced in May that a few main streets will be closed off to cars and vans in or­der to al­low peo­ple to walk and cy­cle safely fol­low­ing the eas­ing of lock­down re­stric­tions. He said this would en­cour­age walk­ing and cy­cling, which would in turn help to re­duce crowd­ing on pub­lic trans­port with­out mak­ing peo­ple turn to cars.</p>
    <p>BO­GOTA</p>
    <p>The Colom­bian cap­i­tal opened 76km of tem­po­rary cy­cling lanes ear­lier this year in or­der to re­duce crowd­ing on pub­lic trans­port to help pre­vent the spread of Covid-19 and also to im­prove air qual­ity. It also cre­ated 22km worth of cy­cling lanes through the re­con­fig­ur­ing of car lanes.</p>
