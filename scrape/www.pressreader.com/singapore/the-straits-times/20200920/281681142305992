    <p>This week­end’s protest is led by the United Front of Tham­masat and Demon­stra­tion (UFTD), a group of stu­dents from Tham­masat Univer­sity who are mak­ing the most stri­dent call yet for re­form of Thai­land’s pow­er­ful monar­chy.</p>
    <p>UFTD is al­lied with, but sep­a­rate from, the Free Youth and Free Peo­ple groups, which have over the past few months or­gan­ised demon­stra­tions to de­mand that the mil­i­tary-backed Con­sti­tu­tion be amended, fresh elec­tions be held, and that the gov­ern­ment stop ha­rass­ing dis­si­dents.</p>
    <p>UFTD leader Panusaya Sithi­ji­rawat­tanakul, 22, shook the coun­try dur­ing an Aug 10 rally at Tham­masat Univer­sity’s Pathum Thani cam­pus when she read out on stage a list of 10 pro­pos­als for monar­chy re­form.</p>
    <p>On be­half of UFTD, she called for Thai­land’s lese ma­jeste law to be abol­ished, that the na­tional bud­get al­lo­cated to the King be re­duced and that his per­sonal as­sets be clearly de­lin­eated from the Crown’s.</p>
    <p>She also called for the end of pub­lic­ity ef­forts that ex­ces­sively glo­ri­fied the monarch. Such de­mands, voiced pre­vi­ously only by Thai ex­iles or be­hind closed doors, caused a back­lash among roy­al­ists but were later widely dis­cussed on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>UFTD has re­sisted pres­sure to re­tract its de­mands. In­stead, it raised the ante with this week­end’s rally at Tham­masat Univer­sity’s Tha Prachan cam­pus i n Bangkok. It is a highly sym­bolic venue.</p>
    <p>The cam­pus was where stu­dents ral­ly­ing against the re­turn of a for­mer dic­ta­tor, Thanom Kit­tika­chorn, were at­tacked and lynched by se­cu­rity forces and ul­tra-roy­al­ist mobs in 1976. Dur­ing the tu­mult, a stu­dent was beaten to death and hung from a tree in a neigh­bour­ing field called Sanam Luang.</p>
    <p>The field, which sits next to the Grand Palace, was pre­vi­ously ac­ces­si­ble to the pub­lic, but re­cently fenced up and re­served for royal or of­fi­cial ac­tiv­i­ties. On Satur­day, it was filled by pro­test­ers.</p>
