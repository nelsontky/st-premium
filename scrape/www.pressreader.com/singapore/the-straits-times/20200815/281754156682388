    <p>• South Korea re­ported 103 new coron­avirus cases yes­ter­day, nearly twice as many as the day be­fore, rais­ing the spec­tre of a new wave of in­fec­tions that could un­der­mine its fine-tuned and muchtouted han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is cre­at­ing alarm as the trans­mis­sion route is un­known for more than 13 per cent of the cases – low com­pared with many other Asian na­tions but more than dou­ble the rate of about 6 per cent in May, when there was an out­break at Seoul night­clubs.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials said the latest cases, mostly linked to church gath­er­ings, may pose a greater chal­lenge than the pre­vi­ous flare-up.</p>
    <p>“We are now in a crit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion as lo­cal in­fec­tions are ris­ing ev­ery day amid the va­ca­tion sea­son,” said Dr Kwon Jun-wook, deputy di­rec­tor of the Korea Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion (KCDC).</p>
    <p>“We see signs that cases with­out symp­toms or with mild symp­toms, un­de­tected for some time, may have been silently spread­ing.”</p>
    <p>The jump in cases comes as some of the most suc­cess­ful coun­tries in con­tain­ing the pathogen are now wrestling with sud­den flare-ups – a grim re­minder that the coron­avirus will not be en­tirely stamped out with­out help from a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>If South Korea’s latest out­break wors­ens, it would be a set­back in the global Covid-19 fight.</p>
    <p>Bol­stered by its suc­cess with rapid test­ing and con­tact trac­ing, the coun­try has been held up as a model for democ­ra­cies look­ing to man­age the virus with­out hav­ing to re­sort to re­stric­tive lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Once the world’s sec­ond hard­esthit na­tion, South Korea has one of the low­est in­fec­tion and fa­tal­ity rates among de­vel­oped na­tions.</p>
    <p>Of the 103 new cases yes­ter­day, 85 were lo­cally in­fected while 18 were im­ported, the KCDC said.</p>
    <p>Most are linked to flare-ups at churches, schools and markets.</p>
    <p>The spike fol­lows a re­lax­ation of so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, and ahead of a three-day hol­i­day when many are ex­pected to ven­ture out­doors.</p>
    <p>South Korea has in re­cent weeks al­lowed base­ball and soc­cer fans in the stands, as well as visi­tors to pub­lic parks and mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun said yes­ter­day that the gov­ern­ment may re-im­pose stricter rules in and around Seoul, and urged the pub­lic to fol­low preven­tion guide­lines.</p>
    <p>If the alert is raised, high-risk fa­cil­i­ties such as clubs, pubs and karaoke bars will have to shut.</p>
    <p>Churches and restau­rants will need to re­quire masks and main­tain lists of peo­ple en­ter­ing and leav­ing the fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s virus preven­tion mea­sures are pro­duc­ing a pos­i­tive side ef­fect, though.</p>
    <p>The KCDC re­ported on Thurs­day that the coun­try is see­ing a sharp drop in other in­fec­tious dis­eases, aided by so­cial dis­tanc­ing, hand­wash­ing and mask-wear­ing.</p>
