    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Even with Covid-19 vac­cines on the way, many epi­demi­ol­o­gists do not ex­pect their lives to re­turn to pre-pan­demic nor­mal un­til most Amer­i­cans have been vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, most have eased up on some pre­cau­tions – go­ing to the gro­cery store or see­ing friends out­doors, for ex­am­ple – but are as cau­tious as ever about many ac­tiv­i­ties of daily life.</p>
    <p>In a new in­for­mal sur­vey of 700 epi­demi­ol­o­gists by The New York Times (NYT), half said they would not change their per­sonal be­hav­iour un­til at least 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion was vac­ci­nated. Thirty per cent said they would make some changes once they were vac­ci­nated them­selves.</p>
    <p>A mi­nor­ity of the epi­demi­ol­o­gists said if highly ef­fec­tive vac­cines were widely dis­trib­uted, it would be safe for Amer­i­cans to be­gin liv­ing more freely this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Michi­gan State Univer­sity as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor Kelly Strutz said: “I am op­ti­mistic that the en­cour­ag­ing vac­cine re­sults mean we’ll be back on track by or dur­ing sum­mer 2021.”</p>
    <p>But most said that even with vac­cines, it would prob­a­bly take a year or more for many ac­tiv­i­ties to safely restart and that some parts of their lives may never re­turn to the way they were.</p>
    <p>UCLA pro­fes­sor of epi­demi­ol­ogy Karin Michels said it would prob­a­bly be many years un­til it was safe enough to “re­turn to ap­prox­i­mately the life­style we had”.</p>
    <p>PRE-PAN­DEMIC LIFE</p>
    <p>Of 23 ac­tiv­i­ties of daily life that the sur­vey asked about, there were only three that the ma­jor­ity of re­spon­dents had done in the past month: gath­er­ing out­doors with friends; bring­ing in mail with­out pre­cau­tions; and run­ning er­rands, like go­ing to the gro­cery store or phar­macy.</p>
    <p>The epi­demi­ol­o­gists have al­most en­tirely avoided other parts of pre-pan­demic life. Al­most none said they had at­tended a sport­ing event, play or con­cert; met up with some­one they did not know well; or at­tended a wed­ding or fu­neral.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing in close prox­im­ity to peo­ple I don’t know will al­ways feel less safe than it used to,” said Dr El­li­cott Matthay, a post­doc­toral scholar at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>Three-quar­ters of re­spon­dents said they planned to spend Christ­mas, Hanukkah or other win­ter hol­i­days with only mem­bers of their house­hold, or not cel­e­brate at all, sim­i­lar to how they spent Thanks­giv­ing.</p>
    <p>When asked about the safest and riski­est ac­tiv­i­ties on the list, most epi­demi­ol­o­gists agreed on these gen­eral prin­ci­ples: They are less wor­ried about out­door ac­tiv­i­ties and about touch­ing sur­faces, and more wor­ried about in­door ac­tiv­i­ties and those with large groups.</p>
    <p>But even the epi­demi­ol­o­gists did not all agree on their as­sess­ment of risk.</p>
    <p>“In­door venues with lots of peo­ple is the riski­est sit­u­a­tion,” said Dr Le­land Ack­er­son of the Univer­sity of Mas­sachusetts. “Out­doors with few peo­ple, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and pre­cau­tions is the least risky.”</p>
    <p>He said that dur­ing the past month, he had hiked with friends, opened mail with­out pre­cau­tions and run er­rands.</p>
    <p>Six months ago, NYT asked a sim­i­lar group of epi­demi­ol­o­gists about when life might go back to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Most then guessed that peo­ple would need to wait a year or more for many as­pects of daily life to nor­malise.</p>
    <p>HERD IM­MU­NITY</p>
    <p>This time, as the spread of the virus has wors­ened but the treat­ments have im­proved, NYT fo­cused its ques­tions on how they have been liv­ing in the thick of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s funny – when asked this be­fore, I was so op­ti­mistic about the US be­ing able to lead and ad­dress this in a timely fash­ion,” said Univer­sity of Min­nesota as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Rachel Widome.</p>
    <p>“I said I thought things would be bet­ter by now. I was very wrong. They are dra­mat­i­cally worse.”</p>
    <p>Most sci­en­tists say around 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion will need to be im­mune for the United States to reach herd im­mu­nity, when the virus slows down sig­nif­i­cantly or stops. Herd im­mu­nity is cru­cial, they say, for peo­ple to safely re­sume many parts of life, and the fastest and safest way to achieve it is through vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, who is lead­ing the gov­ern­ment’s Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed vac­cine de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme, said vac­cines may roll out quickly enough for the US to reach herd im­mu­nity by early sum­mer.</p>
    <p>But sci­en­tists do not yet know if vac­ci­nated peo­ple could still spread the virus.</p>
    <p>Nearly a third of re­spon­dents said they would be com­fort­able re­turn­ing to more ac­tiv­i­ties of daily life once they were vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Some said they would feel com­fort­able do­ing only cer­tain things, like so­cial­is­ing with peo­ple who had also been vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>“I would do some min­i­mal travel, small in­door gath­er­ings with other close rel­a­tives when I am vac­ci­nated, but main­tain safety pre­cau­tions such as wear­ing a mask and so­cially dis­tance,” said Dr Gabriela Vazquez Ben­itez, a se­nior re­search in­ves­ti­ga­tor at HealthPart­ners In­sti­tute, a non-profit group.</p>
