    <p>Twenty-one years af­ter a group of re­gional edi­tors sealed an agree­ment in Bangkok to form a vol­un­tary al­liance, Asia News Net­work (ANN) has taken a ma­jor step for­ward with its for­mal regis­tra­tion as a le­gal en­tity, based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The new com­pany, Asia News Net­work Lim­ited, will strive to bring Asia closer through an ac­tive shar­ing of news con­tent on de­vel­op­ments in the re­gion be­tween the 23 mem­bers of the al­liance.</p>
    <p>Be­com­ing a for­mal le­gal en­tity was also con­sid­ered nec­es­sary to en­able the group­ing to col­lab­o­rate more on joint projects, such as host­ing con­fer­ences to­gether and syn­di­ca­tion of con­tent.</p>
    <p>Born as a group­ing of nine me­dia ti­tles, ANN now con­sists of 23 lead­ing ti­tles of the re­gion, based in ma­jor lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The net­work’s mem­bers hail from the 10 South-east Asian economies, China, Ja­pan and South Korea as well as In­dia, Bangladesh, Pak­istan and other coun­tries in South Asia.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times is a found­ing mem­ber of the al­liance.</p>
    <p>Said Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, ed­i­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group and ed­i­tor of ST, who is also chair­man of the net­work: “Af­ter 20 years of work­ing to­gether, all of us felt it was time for us to take things for­ward, by form­ing a com­pany lim­ited by guar­an­tee, based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“This opens up new op­por­tu­ni­ties for us to col­lab­o­rate on ed­i­to­rial projects, work­ing with part­ners and spon­sors, and other ini­tia­tives, all with a view to pro­mot­ing good journalism and cred­i­ble con­tent on the re­gion, across the ANN group­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ravin­dra Kumar, ed­i­tor and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of The States­man in In­dia, said the regis­tra­tion means ANN’s “in­sti­tu­tion­al­i­sa­tion as an en­tity whose per­ma­nence is guar­an­teed by the com­mit­ment of its mem­bers”.</p>
    <p>Ms Es­ther Ng, chief con­tent of­fi­cer at Malaysia’s Star Me­dia Group, said the change in ANN’s sta­tus is “an op­por­tu­nity for the al­liance to seek new part­ners and spon­sors, open­ing up a whole new di­men­sion for the group­ing”.</p>
    <p>“This is new ter­ri­tory, so it is ex­cit­ing,” she added.</p>
    <p>The found­ing mem­bers of the net­work sought to pro­mote cov­er­age of Asian af­fairs through re­gional jour­nal­ists for an Asian au­di­ence, at the time of in­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing costs of sub­scrib­ing to in­ter­na­tional wire ser­vices in the years af­ter the 1997 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis weighed among con­sid­er­a­tions of the edi­tors to es­tab­lish the group­ing.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers now see bring­ing Asia closer, as the group’s motto says, as their key chal­lenge as the group­ing be­gins a new chap­ter.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Fer­nan­dez: “Given the many chal­lenges fac­ing the me­dia in­dus­try, there is much scope, and need, for me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions to work more closely to­gether, from train­ing and de­vel­op­ing our jour­nal­ists to work­ing on joint ed­i­to­rial projects and events.”</p>
    <p>Said Mr Mah­fuz Anam, ed­i­tor and pub­lisher of Bangladesh’s The Daily Star: “It is my hope that in the com­ing years we will re­ally be able to bring Asia closer through a more in­tense ex­change of news and views to cre­ate a part­ner­ship of growth and pros­per­ity that will make the com­ing Asian Cen­tury truly re­mark­able.”</p>
    <p>The process to trans­form the vol­un­tary al­liance into a le­gal en­tity com­menced soon af­ter the net­work marked its 20th an­niver­sary in Seoul in April last year.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the al­liance de­bated two other prom­i­nent lo­ca­tions – Tokyo and Perth – rec­om­mended by in­ter­na­tional pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm KPMG be­fore vot­ing in favour of mov­ing the al­liance from Bangkok to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Over the years, mem­bers have col­lab­o­rated on sev­eral ed­i­to­rial projects, hosted con­fer­ences in dif­fer­ent coun­tries and en­gaged heads of gov­ern­ment in con­ver­sa­tion, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, Chi­nese Premier Li Ke­qiang and for­mer Ja­panese prime min­is­ter Ju­nichiro Koizumi.</p>
    <p>The group­ing’s mem­bers are Bangladesh’s The Daily Star, Bhutan’s Kuensel, Brunei’s Bor­neo Bul­letin, Cam­bo­dia’s The Ph­nom Penh Post and Ras­mei Kam­puchea, China Daily in China and Hong Kong, In­dia’s The States­man, In­done­sia’s The Jakarta Post, Ja­pan’s The Ja­pan News, Laos’ Vi­en­tiane Times, Malaysia’s The Star and Sin Chew Daily, Mon­go­lia’s Gogo Mon­go­lia, Myan­mar’s Eleven Me­dia Group, Nepal’s The Kath­mandu Post, Pak­istan’s Dawn, the Philip­pines’ Philip­pine Daily Inquirer, Sin­ga­pore’s The Straits Times, South Korea’s The Korea Her­ald, Sri Lanka’s The Is­land, Thai­land’s The Na­tion and Viet­nam’s Viet­nam News.</p>
