    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia said yes­ter­day it will im­pose strict move­ment re­stric­tions in four dis­tricts in its largest palm oil-pro­duc­ing state of Sabah, af­ter re­port­ing more than 1,000 coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions there this month.</p>
    <p>The surge in cases in Sabah comes af­ter the state held elec­tions at the week­end, where the na­tion’s rul­ing coali­tion con­tin­ued its streak of vic­to­ries to win the key op­po­si­tion state amid chal­lenges to Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s pre­mier­ship.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion was dogged by politi­cians test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus as the state be­came the new epi­cen­tre of Malaysia’s out­break.</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said that as part of ef­forts to con­tain the out­break, non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses in La­had Datu, Tawau, Ku­nak and Sem­porna district will be re­quired to shut down start­ing to­day for a pe­riod of 14 days.</p>
    <p>Sabah ac­counts for 25 per cent of the crude palm oil pro­duced in the world’s sec­ond-largest ex­porter.</p>
    <p>Malaysia had on Sun­day re­ported the high­est daily surge in coro­n­avirus cases since Sept 11, the ma­jor­ity of them in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials con­firmed 150 new in­fec­tions on Sun­day, ac­cord­ing to the Health Min­istry, with 124 re­ported in the Bor­neo state. There was one ad­di­tional death, also from Sabah, rais­ing the na­tional tally to 134.</p>
    <p>An­other 115 new cases were re­ported yes­ter­day, bring­ing the coun­try’s to­tal in­fec­tions since the out­break be­gan to 11,034.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have added more health work­ers and equip­ment at the coun­try’s main Kuala Lumpur In­ter­na­tional Air­port to check on flight pas­sen­gers from Sabah, fol­low­ing com­plaints on so­cial me­dia that many had to queue be­tween three and six hours to get Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>Those ar­riv­ing must take oral or nasal swabs and, if found neg­a­tive, will be tagged with health arm­bands and un­dergo a com­pul­sory 14-day home quar­an­tine or­der. Those who test pos­i­tive are taken to hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>With the polls over, many po­lit­i­cal cam­paign­ers are fly­ing back to Kuala Lumpur, join­ing other ar­rivals from Sabah, Malaysia’s sec­ond big­gest state af­ter Sarawak.</p>
    <p>Ar­riv­ing pas­sen­gers had com­plained on so­cial me­dia that there were not enough per­son­nel man­ning the tests, and this was com­pounded when more flights ar­rived.</p>
    <p>The long wait an­gered the ex­hausted and hun­gry pas­sen­gers, and there was con­cern over the lack of so­cial dis­tanc­ing in the crowded ar­rival cor­ri­dors.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Ad­ham Baba and the min­istry’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah ar­rived at the air­port early yes­ter­day morn­ing to sur­vey the scene.</p>
    <p>“The crowd­ing prob­lem will be im­me­di­ately re­solved with ad­di­tional equip­ment and per­son­nel,” the min­istry said on its Twit­ter ac­count yes­ter­day.</p>
