    <p>The Chief Jus­tice has given the goa­head for in­ves­ti­ga­tions into two deputy public pros­e­cu­tors to com­mence, fol­low­ing a mis­con­duct com­plaint by for­mer do­mes­tic helper Parti Liyani.</p>
    <p>DPP Tan Yany­ing and DPP Tan Wee Hao han­dled Ms Parti’s theft trial, where she was ac­cused of steal­ing $34,000 worth of items from her for­mer em­ployer Liew Mun Leong, who is the for­mer chair­man of Changi Air­port Group.</p>
    <p>The charge al­leged that the 46-year-old In­done­sian had stolen, among other things, a Pioneer DVD player.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, who worked for the Liews for nine years, claimed trial in April 2018. In March last year, she was jailed for 26 months.</p>
    <p>On her ap­peal to the High Court, the DVD player was found to be faulty, and she was ac­quit­ted of all charges on Sept 4 this year.</p>
    <p>In June, be­fore her ac­quit­tal, Ms Parti filed a com­plaint against the DPPs.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, the DPPs showed Ms Parti that the de­vice could play a video dig­i­tally stored in the hard disk. But dur­ing the ap­peal, it was shown that the de­vice could not play DVDs.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment re­leased yes­ter­day, Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon wrote: “I am sat­is­fied that there is a prima fa­cie case that the DPPs’ con­duct might sug­gest a lack of can­dour and that this may have re­sulted in the ap­pli­cant be­ing cross-ex­am­ined un­fairly, and in the ap­pli­cant and the court be­ing mis­led.”</p>
    <p>Ms Parti con­tended that the DPPs had con­cealed ma­te­rial facts and there­fore cre­ated the false im­pres­sion that the de­vice was fully func­tional. She ar­gued that were it not for this false im­pres­sion, she would not have agreed, un­der cross-ex­am­i­na­tion, that the de­vice was op­er­a­tional and that this con­tra­dicted her de­fence that she was al­lowed to take the player as it was bro­ken.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of this, the DPPs sug­gested she had lied about the cir­cum­stances in which the de­vice came to be in her pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice found that the DPPs had rea­son to think there were is­sues with the DVD player’s func­tion­al­ity; that they did not make this known to the trial judge, Ms Par ti or her lawyer Anil Balchan­dani; and that the DPPs had gone fur­ther to sug­gest that there were no prob­lems with the func­tion­al­ity of the de­vice.</p>
    <p>He noted that the DPPs ap­peared to have had trou­ble play­ing a DVD on the player on Sept 26, 2018, when they were test­ing it on their own be­fore the trial. They later con­ceded this at the hear­ing of the ap­peal.</p>
    <p>And dur­ing the DPPs’ demon­stra­tion of the DVD player that day, nei­ther of them in­formed the judge that the player had two modes or that they had dif­fi­cul­ties play­ing a DVD ear­lier in the morn­ing. Ms Parti stated that at that point, she did not know the DVD player had two modes.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, dur­ing his re-ex­am­i­na­tion of Ms Parti on Dec 4 that year, Mr Balchan­dani tried to play two dif­fer­ent DVDs, which prompted var­i­ous er­ror mes­sages.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice also found that it seemed ar­guable that the DPPs had gone fur­ther to sug­gest that there were no prob­lems with the func­tion­al­ity of the de­vice.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Mr Balchan­dani’s re­ex­am­i­na­tion of Ms Parti, DPP Tan Yany­ing as­serted that the DPPs’ ear­lier demon­stra­tion proved that the de­vice was work­ing, and ob­jected to the lawyer try­ing to con­duct an­other demon­stra­tion. She said there was “no con­fu­sion” as to whether it worked since Ms Parti had “tes­ti­fied ex­plic­itly and ex­pressly” that it did.</p>
    <p>The DPPs also said in their clos­ing sub­mis­sions that there were no is­sues at all with the de­vice, and any ap­par­ent is­sues were prob­a­bly due to the DVD Mr Balchan­dani used, rather than with the player it­self.</p>
    <p>On grant­ing leave to in­ves­ti­gate the DPPs, the Chief Jus­tice em­pha­sised that he had not re­garded any de­fences the DPPs may raise and had not con­sid­ered any spe­cific ex­pla­na­tion the DPPs may have that may ex­plain their con­duct and even ex­cul­pate them.</p>
    <p>Lawyers Peter Low and Choo Zheng Xi are rep­re­sent­ing Ms Parti for the dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings. The Chief Jus­tice had ear­lier noted that Ms Parti would likely have to ap­point an­other lawyer if Mr Balchan­dani is to be a wit­ness in the pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>The high-pro­file case has sparked a public out­cry, with ques­tions raised about the ev­i­dence-gath­er­ing process and the way in which the trial was con­ducted.</p>
    <p>Re­views by the po­lice and the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers are ex­pected to con­clude this month.</p>
