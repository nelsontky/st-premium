    <p>The main­te­nance of air-con­di­tion­ing me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion (ACMV) ducts within build­ings is not sub­ject to reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments, said the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A BCA spokesman told The Straits Times that “build­ing own­ers are responsibl­e for the main­te­nance of their build­ings, by en­sur­ing that all parts of their build­ings are main­tained in a state of good and ser­vice­able con­di­tion”.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes the “main­te­nance of in­te­rior fit­tings such as ACMV ducts”, fol­low­ing an in­ci­dent on Sun­day at Nex shop­ping mall, where a ven­ti­la­tion duct fell in the Shaw The­atres cin­ema and in­jured two pa­trons.</p>
    <p>BCA has since in­structed the cin­ema to close for a thor­ough check, and in­ves­ti­ga­tions by an ap­pointed pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>A spokesman from Nex said that “all main­te­nance of var­i­ous me­chan­i­cal and en­gi­neer­ing sys­tems for the com­mon ar­eas in the build­ing are car­ried out ac­cord­ing to a planned sched­ule by ap­pointed spe­cial­ist con­trac­tors”.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, when the main­te­nance team on­site ob­serves any ab­nor­mal­i­ties in the course of their work of these sys­tems in the com­mon ar­eas, they will con­duct fur­ther in­spec­tions or checks to de­ter­mine the cause and take ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>The shop­ping mall is co-owned by Mer­ca­tus and Gold Ridge, and man­aged by the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Daniel Wong from the de­part­ment of build­ing at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s School of De­sign and En­vi­ron­ment said the main­te­nance of duct sys­tems in build­ings tends to be very ad hoc and in­fre­quent, ow­ing to the high costs in­volved and the dis­rup­tion it causes.</p>
    <p>“The sus­pended ceil­ing has to be cut open for in­spec­tion and clean­ing of the duct sys­tems, which are con­ducted sep­a­rately – and this is usu­ally very dis­rup­tive, hence it is done in­fre­quently,” said Prof Wong. Ideally, the in­spec­tion of duct sys­tems should be pe­ri­od­i­cally sched­uled, but some com­pa­nies avoid do­ing main­te­nance work for as long as five to 10 years, and usu­ally fo­cus on es­sen­tial or heavy-use ar­eas, he said.</p>
