    <p>“Don’t over­think” is vet­eran film­maker and Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Eric Khoo’s favourite piece of ad­vice to his 26-year-old son, Edward Khoo.</p>
    <p>The father-and-son duo col­lab­o­rated on the younger Khoo’s nos­tal­gic short film, Video Store. It was one of three short films screened at the launch of ciNE65 2021 at Sin­ga­pore Dis­cov­ery Cen­tre yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>CiNE65 started as a bi­en­nial short film com­pe­ti­tion in 2011 by Nexus, a De­fence Min­istry depart­ment re­spon­si­ble for to­tal de­fence and na­tional ed­u­ca­tion. Its sixth sea­son next year will con­sist of film-mak­ing work­shops and sem­i­nars, a film fes­ti­val and the ciNE65 Movie Mak­ers Awards.</p>
    <p>Video Store is set in Rida’s Video Cen­tre, a brick-and-mor­tar video rental store – now a rare sight in Sin­ga­pore – which Edward Khoo has pa­tro­n­ised since his child­hood days. The film re­volves around Sofie, a young woman who grew up in her mother’s video store and who fondly rem­i­nisces about her in­ter­ac­tions with cus­tomers whom she has met in the store.</p>
    <p>The idea for the film was first sug­gested by Eric Khoo.</p>
    <p>Edward Khoo, who re­cently grad­u­ated from New York Univer­sity Tisch School of the Arts, says: “My dad re­minded me that, over a year ago, he took a pic­ture of Rida’s.</p>
    <p>“He sent me the pic­ture and said, ‘Ed, you re­ally should make a film.’”</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on the store’s old­school charm, he adds: “I re­alised that go­ing to phys­i­cal spa­ces and meet­ing peo­ple is an­other as­pect of why I think film is a su­per so­cial medium. Go­ing to the theatre is a so­cial ex­pe­ri­ence, but so is shop­ping for video rentals.”</p>
    <p>The theme of ciNE65’s up­com­ing sea­son is Stronger, To­gether. It aims to en­cour­age young as­pir­ing lo­cal film-mak­ers to cre­ate works ex­plor­ing how Sin­ga­pore­ans come to­gether in times of ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>At the launch, ciNE65 alumni film-mak­ers Lan Yu and Mo­hamed Yahssir also shared their short films.</p>
    <p>Lan, 25, who won Over­all Best Film and Best Screen­play at last year’s ciNE65 Movie Mak­ers Awards, re­turned with the short film A Cat’s Pur­pose, about a man who sleeps rough and the un­likely re­la­tion­ship he strikes up with a stray cat.</p>
    <p>In­spired by her in­ter­ac­tions with a home­less per­son dur­ing her univer­sity ex­change in Ger­many in 2017, she set out to un­der­stand more about this com­mu­nity back in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised that there was a dis­con­nect be­tween what we see and the real sit­u­a­tion on the ground,” says Lan, now a writer with lo­cal pro­duc­tion house Weave.</p>
    <p>“We have to recog­nise that be­yond what is shown in the me­dia, there may be a bet­ter way to rep­re­sent rough sleep­ers.”</p>
    <p>Yahssir, 37, who was a com­mis­sioned film-maker for ciNE65’s third sea­son, made short film Su­per Girl, which he says is about “how an in­di­vid­ual can do ex­tra­or­di­nary things with the help of com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>The father of four, who has 15 years of film-mak­ing ex­pe­ri­ence un­der his belt, has con­sis­tently re­turned to ciNE65 to con­duct work­shops as he wants to men­tor a younger gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The founder of Mil­lenia Mo­tion Pic­tures says: “CiNE65 gave me the great op­por­tu­nity to min­gle with the young film-mak­ers. There’s al­ways a take­away for both par­ties and I adopt the men­tal­ity that you learn wher­ever you go.”</p>
    <p>The short films will be re­leased one a day on ciNE65’s so­cial me­dia plat­forms, starting from to­day.</p>
    <p>The ciNE65 2021 Movie Mak­ers Awards will open for sub­mis­sions from Jan 1 to March 14 next year. For more de­tails, go to www. face­book.com/ciNE65.</p>
