    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK The dop­ing scheme was cre­ated to make Rus­sia the un­ques­tioned cham­pion of the 2014 Sochi Win­ter Olympics, to en­sure Rus­sian dom­i­nance on home soil, to claim vic­to­ries for Rus­sian ath­letes, to sweep up more gold medals than any other coun­try.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it pro­duced a scan­dal with no end in sight.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, more than six years af­ter the Sochi Games, Rus­sia’s ef­forts to deny and defy the global sport­ing com­mu­nity’s find­ings about its state-backed dop­ing pro­gramme reached yet another low.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport’s (CAS) anti-dop­ing di­vi­sion stripped Rus­sian biath­lete Evgeny Ustyu­gov of the medals he won at the Vancouver and Sochi Win­ter Olympics.</p>
    <p>In tak­ing back Ustyu­gov’s gold from Sochi, the court also ef­fec­tively re­voked Rus­sia’s sta­tus as the big win­ner from the Sochi Games, which are now re­mem­bered for be­ing among the most-tainted com­pe­ti­tions in sports history.</p>
    <p>The court’s de­ci­sion, an­nounced by the In­ter­na­tional Biathlon Union (IBU), also sug­gested that Rus­sia’s pun­ish­ments may be far from over.</p>
    <p>In its rul­ing, the court called the key whis­tle-blower who re­vealed the scan­dal “a cred­i­ble wit­ness who had di­rect knowl­edge of cir­cum­stances”, and said it had re­lied on the in­for­ma­tion he had pro­vided.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing by CAS, which con­firmed a de­ci­sion reached ear­lier this year, is another re­minder of how Rus­sia’s cheat­ing scheme con­tin­ues to al­ter the record books from world cham­pi­onships and Olympic Games long af­ter it was un­cov­ered in 2015.</p>
    <p>Nor­way, which won 11 gold medals in Sochi to Rus­sia’s 10, is now the outright leader in golds from those Games.</p>
    <p>In Tues­day’s an­nounce­ment, the court came to the same con­clu­sion reached by the IBU in Fe­bru­ary to dis­qual­ify Ustyu­gov and his win­ning re­lay team in Sochi. It also stripped Ustyu­gov of a gold and bronze medal he was awarded at the Vancouver Games in 2010.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia, which is also ap­peal­ing against a four-year ban from global sports, con­tin­ues to con­test much of what has now been re­vealed by whis­tle-blow­ers, in­ves­ti­ga­tors and lab­o­ra­tory data.</p>
    <p>Its lawyers tried to clear Ustyu­gov by in­tro­duc­ing pri­vate tests, taken in 2017, that claimed his ab­nor­mal blood re­sults were the out­come of a rare ge­netic ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>That claim, which had been en­dorsed by se­nior Rus­sian sports of­fi­cials and even the coun­try’s Pres­i­dent, Vladimir Putin, was dis­missed by the court.</p>
    <p>The court’s rul­ing also un­der­scored the con­tin­ued im­por­tance of the whis­tle-blower Grig­ory Rod­chenkov, the for­mer head of the Moscow lab­o­ra­tory at the heart of the dop­ing scheme, to on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>In in­ter­views with The New York Times in 2016, he pulled back the cur­tain on Rus­sia’s huge dop­ing pro­gramme, and he con­tin­ues to pro­vide in­ves­ti­ga­tors with cru­cial de­tails in on­go­ing dop­ing cases.</p>
    <p>He is now liv­ing un­der wit­ness pro­tec­tion in the United States.</p>
    <p>The court’s val­i­da­tion of Rod­chenkov’s ev­i­dence is likely to un­der­mine ap­peals by other Rus­sian ath­letes and also play a part in a defama­tion suit against him in the US by two fe­male biath­letes.</p>
    <p>Their law­suit is be­ing backed by Mikhail Prokhorov, the for­mer bil­lion­aire owner of the Brook­lyn Nets who led Rus­sia’s biathlon fed­er­a­tion be­fore and dur­ing the 2014 Sochi Games.</p>
    <p>Biathlon was among the sports most tar­geted by Rus­sia for medals in Sochi and sev­eral Rus­sian ath­letes who com­peted at the Games have al­ready been linked to the dop­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers of the sport’s global gov­ern­ing body were forced out af</p>
    <p>ter pros­e­cu­tors in Aus­tria and Nor­way claimed up to US$300,000 (S$409,000) had been paid to cover up dop­ing in­fringe­ments they said were car­ried out by Rus­sian ath­letes.</p>
    <p>The ver­dict against Ustyu­gov is also a per­sonal blow to Mr Putin, who had ex­pressed his hope that ge­netic tests taken long af­ter the ath­lete had re­tired would lead to his ex­on­er­a­tion. The court, though, paid lit­tle mind to the ge­netic ev­i­dence, agree­ing with the IBU that it was in­ad­mis­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“The sole ar­bi­tra­tor is not pre­pared to ac­cept the in­clu­sion of pri­vate blood tests taken over a pe­riod of five years since the ath­lete re­tired, taken in un­known cir­cum­stances and for un­known pur­poses,” the rul­ing said.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the ar­bi­tra­tor said it was clear be­yond rea­son­able doubt that Ustyu­gov was a part of the broader cheat­ing pro­gramme di­rected by Rod­chenkov.</p>
    <p>A panel of ex­perts found his so­called ath­lete bi­o­log­i­cal pass­port showed an ar­ti­fi­cial spike in his haemoglobi­n lev­els be­fore both the Vancouver and Sochi Games.</p>
    <p>“It is dif­fi­cult to con­clude other than that the ath­lete has had the ben­e­fit of pro­tec­tion and sup­port to ar­ti­fi­cially aug­ment his per­for­mance through dop­ing and to avoid de­tec­tion,” the rul­ing said.</p>
    <p>“Given the di­ver­sity of sup­port, its elab­o­rate na­ture and its ex­tent, it could not have been achieved other than with a sig­nif­i­cant de­gree of or­ches­tra­tion or com­mon en­ter­prise to com­mit the in­stant anti-dop­ing rule vi­o­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>Guided by Rod­chenkov and backed by of­fi­cials at the high­est lev­els of the Rus­sian state, the dop­ing pro­gramme was multi-pronged and so­phis­ti­cated enough to go un­de­tected for years.</p>
    <p>It in­volved pro­tect­ing the best ath­letes by falsely re­port­ing pos­i­tive tests as neg­a­tive and swop­ping out tainted urine sam­ples.</p>
    <p>The CAS case also but­tressed the con­tin­ued value of a 2016 re­port by Cana­dian lawyer Richard McLaren in on­go­ing Rus­sian dop­ing probes.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral more cases are ex­pected to be heard as the World Anti-Dop­ing Agency con­tin­ues to pros­e­cute in­di­vid­ual ath­letes af­ter iden­ti­fy­ing 578 sus­pi­cious sam­ples from 298 ath­letes af­ter gain­ing ac­cess to the Moscow lab­o­ra­tory data last year.</p>
