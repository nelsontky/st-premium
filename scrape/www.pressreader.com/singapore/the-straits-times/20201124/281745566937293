    <p>•</p>
    <p>China is plan­ning new mea­sures to en­cour­age more births and ad­dress its rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion as part of its new 2021-2025 “five-year plan”, state me­dia re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment will of­fer ex­ten­sive fi­nan­cial and pol­icy sup­port to en­cour­age cou­ples to have more chil­dren, the of­fi­cial China Daily cited ex­perts as say­ing.</p>
    <p>China in­tro­duced a con­tro­ver­sial “one-child pol­icy” in 1978, say­ing ef­forts to re­duce poverty and de­velop the econ­omy were be­ing un­der­mined by rapid pop­u­la­tion growth.</p>
    <p>But the world’s most pop­u­lous na­tion de­cided in 2016 to re­lax curbs and al­low cou­ples to have a sec­ond child in a bid to ad­dress the rapid in­crease in the num­ber of elderly as well as a dwin­dling work­force.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts say it should now scrap all lim­its en­tirely.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cit­i­zens aged 60 or over stood at 254 mil­lion at the end of last year, ac­count­ing for 18.1 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber is ex­pected to rise to 300 mil­lion by 2025 and 400 mil­lion by 2035, putting huge pres­sure on the coun­try’s health and so­cial care sys­tem, de­mog­ra­phers say.</p>
    <p>De­mog­ra­phers also pre­dict that on cur­rent trends, the num­ber of people of work­ing age could de­cline by 200 mil­lion by 2050.</p>
    <p>De­spite the re­lax­ation of the one-child pol­icy in 2016, the num­ber of live births per 1,000 people fell to a record low of 10.48 last year, down from 10.94 in 2018. Poli­cies aimed at sup­press­ing pop­u­la­tion growth must be re­placed by a sys­tem de­signed to boost fer­til­ity, the of­fi­cial Le­gal Daily said, cit­ing gov­ern­ment ex­perts.</p>
