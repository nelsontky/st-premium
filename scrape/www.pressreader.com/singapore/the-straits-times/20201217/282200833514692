    <p>Read­ers of Lianhe Zaobao have picked “zhao”, or mask, as the word of the year in an an­nual poll.</p>
    <p>The poll, which is in its 10th year, in­vited read­ers of the flag­ship Chi­nese news­pa­per of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings to re­flect on the past year and choose a Chi­nese char­ac­ter out of 10 that best rep­re­sented lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional news in 2020.</p>
    <p>The 10 char­ac­ters were nom­i­nated by a panel of five pro­fes­sion­als in var­i­ous fields and in­cluded words like “zai” (dis­as­ter) and “zhai” (house­bound).</p>
    <p>Close to 10,000 votes were cast be­tween Nov 22 and Dec 7.</p>
    <p>“Zhao” re­ceived about a fifth, or 2,415, of the votes, while “wen” (plague) came in sec­ond with 2,026 votes. “Feng” (lock­down) was third with 1,431 votes.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh Sin Teck, ed­i­tor of Lianhe Zaobao and the Chi­nese even­ing daily Lianhe Wan­bao, said he was not sur­prised that read­ers chose “zhao”.</p>
    <p>“With the pan­demic, masks have be­come an in­sep­a­ra­ble part of our lives, as we breathe and speak through them. Even with a vac­cine, wear­ing masks would still be an im­por­tant preven­tive mea­sure for Covid-19,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Han Yong May, New­sHub ed­i­tor of Chi­nese Me­dia Group, said: “The word ‘zhao’ car­ries dif­fer­ent mean­ings. It is a noun which refers to the masks that we wear (kou zhao). It is also a verb which means ‘to pro­vide cover and pro­tec­tion’ (zhao zhu).”</p>
    <p>The win­ning word was an­nounced on Mon­day dur­ing an on­line pro­gramme hosted by Ms Lee Lay Ming, New­sHub as­so­ciate dig­i­tal plat­form ed­i­tor of Chi­nese Me­dia Group. DJs De Ming and Jing Yun from 96.3 Hao FM un­veiled the word af­ter cy­cling around down­town Sin­ga­pore along a route that traced out the num­ber “2020”.</p>
