    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can ac­tor Wil­ford Brim­ley (right), best known for his roles in the Os­car­win­ning movie Co­coon (1985) and Quaker Oats com­mer­cials, died at the age of 85 last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>He had been sick for two months with a kid­ney ail­ment, said his agent Lynda Ben­sky.</p>
    <p>Utah-born Brim­ley found his way into the film in­dus­try through stunt work around horse rid­ing, be­fore tak­ing on suc­ces­sively larger roles in his 40s and 50s which brought him fame play­ing some­times gruff but lov­able mus­ta­chioed se­niors.</p>
    <p>He had a re­cur­ring role on the tele­vi­sion se­ries The Wal­tons (1972 to 1981) when ac­tor Michael Dou­glas, the pro­ducer of the 1979 film The China Syn­drome, gave him his break­through role: Ted Spindler, an as­sis­tant en­gi­neer at a nu­clear plant.</p>
    <p>In the film’s cli­mac­tic scene, in which he is be­ing in­ter­viewed by a cru­sad­ing TV re­porter played by ac­tress Jane Fonda, Brim­ley de­liv­ered an im­pas­sioned de­fence of his boss (Jack Lem­mon), who had pre­cip­i­tated a cri­sis to draw pub­lic at­ten­tion to de­fects at the plant.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle for The New York Times (NYT) sin­gling out Brim­ley as a tal­ent to watch, film critic Janet Maslin called him “the mus­ta­chioed man who very nearly steals the end­ing of China Syn­drome from Jane Fonda”.</p>
    <p>Brim­ley fol­lowed up with a small but mem­o­rable per­for­mance as a pug­na­cious district at­tor­ney in Ab­sence Of Mal­ice (1981) and with sup­port­ing roles in The Nat­u­ral (1984), as the put-upon man­ager of a los­ing base­ball team, and The Firm (1993), in which he acted along­side Tom Cruise and played the sin­is­ter head of se­cu­rity at an un­savoury law firm.</p>
    <p>In di­rec­tor Ron Howard’s 1985 fan­tasy film Co­coon, Brim­ley de­liv­ered one of his most en­gag­ing per­for­mances, as a re­tiree who, with ac­tors Don Ameche and Hume Cronyn, re­gains his youth af­ter swim­ming in a magic pool.</p>
    <p>“Wil­ford’s a testy guy, not an easy guy to work with all the time, but he has great in­stincts,” Howard told NYT in 1985. “Many of his scenes were to­tally im­pro­vised.”</p>
    <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Brim­ley was a tele­vi­sion fix­ture as a spokesman for Quaker Oats, gruffly telling view­ers to eat the ce­real be­cause “it’s the right thing to do”, and Liberty Med­i­cal, a com­pany sell­ing di­a­betes-test­ing sup­plies. Brim­ley l earnt that he had the dis­ease in the late 1970s.</p>
    <p>When in­ter­viewed by Wy­oming news­pa­per Pow­ell Tri­bune in 2014, Brim­ley played down his tal­ent.</p>
    <p>“I can’t talk about act­ing,” he said. “I don’t know any­thing about it. I was just lucky enough to get hired.”</p>
    <p>Brim­ley’s first wife, ac­tress Lynne Ba­gley, died in 2000. He is sur­vived by his wife, Bev­erly, and three sons from his first mar­riage, James, John and Wil­liam. An­other son, Lawrence, died in in­fancy.</p>
