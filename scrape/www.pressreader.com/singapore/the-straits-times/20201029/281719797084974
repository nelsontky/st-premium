    <p>WARM SPRINGS (Georgia) • Mr Joe Bi­den flayed US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Tues­day, ac­cus­ing his ri­val of sur­ren­der­ing to a surg­ing pan­demic, as the Demo­crat took his cam­paign to the Repub­li­can strong­hold of Georgia a week be­fore the US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>With the cam­paign down to its fi­nal days, Mr Bi­den tapped one of his top sur­ro­gates, pop­u­lar for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama, to de­liver a clos­ing ar­gu­ment for Democrats in Florida, a must-win swing state for Mr Trump if he is to defy the odds and earn re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, buoyed by poll num­bers that show him lead­ing the in­cum­bent, drilled in on Mr Trump’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, re­mind­ing vot­ers that Mr Trump’s chief of staff Mark Mead­ows had con­ceded that “we’re not go­ing to con­trol the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, speak­ing in Warm Springs, Georgia, branded the re­sponse “a ca­pit­u­la­tion” by a White House that “never re­ally tried” to halt a pan­demic that has now killed more than 226,000 Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>In­stead of act­ing as a wartime pres­i­dent to bat­tle Covid-19 as he promised, Mr Trump “shrugged, he swag­gered and he sur­ren­dered”, Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>“I’m here to tell you: We can and</p>
    <p>we will con­trol this virus,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If you give me the hon­our of serv­ing as your pres­i­dent, clear the decks for ac­tion. For we will act... on the first day of my pres­i­dency to get Covid un­der con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, 77, held a so­cially dis­tanced drive-in rally later in At­lanta, Georgia’s largest city.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump de­feated Demo­crat Hil­lary Clin­ton by five points in Georgia in 2016, but polls show the 74-year-old run­ning neck and neck with Mr Bi­den in the Peach State.</p>
    <p>Georgia last voted for a Demo­crat for pres­i­dent nearly three decades ago – Mr Bill Clin­ton in 1992 – but the Bi­den cam­paign has high hopes of flip­ping the state and also win­ning its two US Se­nate seats up for grabs.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has been main­tain­ing a more con­strained cam­paign sched­ule in­stead of what he called Mr Trump’s “su­per-spreader” events.</p>
    <p>In Florida on Tues­day, where polls show Mr Trump has edged into the slight­est of l eads, Mr Obama of­fered a sear­ing in­dict­ment of the in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent, ac­cus­ing him of in­com­pe­tence, re­peated lies, em­brac­ing dic­ta­tors and ig­nor­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But he also of­fered a blunt assess­ment of how ap­a­thy in 2016 may have sunk Mrs Clin­ton’s hopes of de­feat­ing Mr Trump, telling Democrats at the Or­lando drive-in rally to make a plan and vote early.</p>
    <p>“We were com­pla­cent last time. Folks got a lit­tle lazy, folks took things for granted, and look what hap­pened,” Mr Obama said.</p>
    <p>“Not this time. Not in this elec­tion. Let’s bring it home.”</p>
    <p>A Wash­ing­ton Post/ABC News poll re­leased yes­ter­day found that Mr Bi­den had built a sig­nif­i­cant lead in Wis­con­sin while re­main­ing nar­rowly ahead in Michi­gan.</p>
    <p>Among likely vot­ers in Wis­con­sin, 57 per cent backed Mr Bi­den, while 40 per cent sup­ported Mr Trump. In Michi­gan, 51 per cent backed Mr Bi­den and 44 per cent sup­ported Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s 17-point lead in Wis­con­sin is way more than in other polls, which show a slim­mer 5.5-point lead ac­cord­ing to a Real­Clear­Pol­i­tics av­er­age of polls on Tues­day. The polls were con­ducted from Oct 20 to 25.</p>
    <p>PLEDG­ING IM­ME­DI­ATE AC­TION</p>
    <p>I’m here to tell you: We can and we will con­trol this virus... If you give me the hon­our of serv­ing as your pres­i­dent, clear the decks for ac­tion. For we will act... on the first day of my pres­i­dency to get Covid un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>MR JOE BI­DEN, US pres­i­den­tial can­di­date.</p>
