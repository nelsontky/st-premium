    <p>Tech­nol­ogy, and fin­tech in par­tic­u­lar, has shown dur­ing the eco­nomic cri­sis un­leashed by the pan­demic that it has a role to play in the re­shap­ing of the post-Covid-19 world, Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing direc­tor Ravi Menon (left) said at the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic cri­sis un­leashed by Covid-19 presents an op­por­tu­nity to cre­ate a more in­clu­sive so­ci­ety and a more sus­tain­able planet, Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank chief has said.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy, and fin­tech in par­tic­u­lar, has shown dur­ing this cri­sis that it has a role to play in the re­shap­ing of the post-Covid-19 world, said Mr Ravi Menon, man­ag­ing direc­tor of the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), at an on­line ses­sion of the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis has demon­strated the power of tech­nol­ogy in find­ing so­lu­tions to dif­fi­cult prob­lems, from mak­ing vac­cines and con­tact trac­ing to on­line learn­ing and telemedici­ne, he noted.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also shown how vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple are to the forces of na­ture.</p>
    <p>Thus, the power of fi­nance and tech­nol­ogy can be brought to­gether to help cre­ate a more in­clu­sive and sus­tain­able world.</p>
    <p>“Tech­nol­ogy has been at the fore­front in the fight against Covid-19 and its ef­fects. Like­wise, tech­nol­ogy can play a po­tent role in shap­ing the post-Covid world,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon high­lighted Sin­ga­pore’s ini­tia­tives to make ev­ery ci­ti­zen and ev­ery en­ter­prise dig­i­tally en­abled and fi­nan­cially in­cluded.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tives in­clude per­va­sive elec­tronic pay­ment sys­tems, af­ford­able cross-bor­der re­mit­tances, timely health in­sur­ance claims and holis­tic fi­nan­cial plan­ning.</p>
    <p>On the pay­ment sys­tems front, he cited Fast, which en­ables re­al­time trans­fers through the bank­ing sys­tem, and PayNow, which al­lows peo­ple to send money to the bank ac­counts of in­di­vid­u­als us­ing just their mo­bile phone num­bers or per­sonal ID num­bers and to busi­nesses us­ing their unique en­tity num­bers.</p>
    <p>He said four out of five peo­ple and three out of four ac­tive busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore have adopted PayNow, with monthly trans­ac­tion val­ues on the sys­tem cross­ing the US$3 bil­lion (S$4 bil­lion) mark – a four­fold jump from July last year.</p>
    <p>“This se­cure, in­ter­op­er­a­ble epay­ment in­fra­struc­ture has sup­ported a boom in e-com­merce and a va­ri­ety of on­line ser­vices”, es­pe­cially after Covid-19 struck, he said.</p>
    <p>With Sin­ga­pore’s e-pay­ment in­fra­struc­ture to be ex­tended to non­bank e-wal­let pay­ment providers next Fe­bru­ary, he said: “This com­pletes the last mile in Sin­ga­pore’s jour­ney to cre­ate an open and ac­ces­si­ble e-pay­ment ecosys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides in­di­vid­u­als, small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) are the other fo­cus area on Sin­ga­pore’s fin­tech agenda for a more in­clu­sive so­ci­ety, the MAS chief said.</p>
    <p>He high­lighted how dig­i­tal plat­forms can help SMEs. The Net­worked Trade Plat­form de­vel­oped by Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms, for in­stance, dig­i­tally con­nects play­ers across the trade value chain in Sin­ga­pore and abroad.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness sans Bor­ders (BSB) is an­other plat­form that en­hances lo­cal SMEs’ ac­cess to global op­por­tu­ni­ties. De­vel­oped jointly by MAS and the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, BSB is de­signed to con­nect dif­fer­ent plat­forms glob­ally to help SMEs ac­cess a much larger ecosys­tem of buy­ers and sell­ers.</p>
    <p>He an­nounced yes­ter­day that BSB has been op­er­a­tionalised by a pri­vate en­tity, Prox­tera, and is start­ing its live beta dur­ing the fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>The MAS sep­a­rately is­sued a state­ment say­ing it has started dis­cus­sions with the Bank of Ghana to adopt the BSB open hub of plat­forms be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>To make cross-bor­der pay­ments and set­tle­ments cheaper and faster for SMEs, Mr Menon said the cen­tral bank has been work­ing for five years on Project Ubin, a blockchain-based sys­tem for mul­ti­c­ur­rency set­tle­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ef­forts to mit­i­gate cli­mate risk and build a more sus­tain­able fu­ture in­clude mak­ing its res­i­den­tial precincts more en­ergy-ef­fi­cient and shift­ing to­wards cleaner en­ergy. The Repub­lic also aims to sup­port Asia’s tran­si­tion to­wards greater sus­tain­abil­ity by de­vel­op­ing an Asian car­bon credit mar­ket, funded by a green fi­nance ac­tion plan and us­ing green fin­tech.</p>
    <p>He said the Sus­tain­abil­ity Al­liance for Ac­tion, set up un­der the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try’s Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force, has pro­posed to de­velop a mar­ket ecosys­tem for vol­un­tary car­bon cred­its that can fa­cil­i­tate price dis­cov­ery, im­prove liq­uid­ity and ver­ify the in­tegrity of car­bon cred­its.</p>
    <p>Com­ple­ment­ing the Sus­tain­abil­ity Al­liance, DBS Bank, Te­masek, the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Con­ser­va­tion In­ter­na­tional have come to­gether to re­search na­ture-based so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>He said to strengthen the sec­tor’s re­silience, MAS will is­sue guide­lines for fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to man­age their en­vi­ron­men­tal risks.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy has been at the fore­front in the fight against Covid-19 and its ef­fects. Like­wise, tech­nol­ogy can play a po­tent role in shap­ing the post-Covid world.</p>
    <p>MR RAVI MENON, man­ag­ing direc­tor of the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, on the im­por­tance of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
