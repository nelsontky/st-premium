    <p>Af­ter sex­u­ally stim­u­lat­ing him­self in pub­lic over a pair of shorts, a 35-year-old man took photos of the gar­ment.</p>
    <p>He then posted the photos on his In­sta­gram ac­count, which re­sulted in at least 38 po­lice re­ports be­ing lodged against him.</p>
    <p>Lim Wei Ming was fined $2,400 last Fri­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to one count of caus­ing pub­lic nui­sance by post­ing the photos and one count of pos­sess­ing four ob­scene video clips, which were found on his mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>Two other charges in­volv­ing In­sta­gram posts of Lim sniff­ing fe­male un­der­gar­ments and one count of send­ing four ob­scene video clips to an­other in­di­vid­ual were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion by District Judge Tan Jen Tse.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Lim, who is cur­rently un­em­ployed, com­mit­ted his of­fences last year. He was a Grab driver at the time.</p>
    <p>It was ear­lier re­ported that Lim was ar­rested on Aug 16 last year, af­ter the posts of him sniff­ing lin­gerie started cir­cu­lat­ing on­line a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that some time in 2018, Lim came across a black pair of shorts that was hang­ing on a cloth­ing rack in the vicin­ity of Choa Chu Kang Street 51.</p>
    <p>He sex­u­ally stim­u­lated him­self over the gar­ment be­fore tak­ing photos of it.</p>
    <p>Lim then placed the pair of shorts back on the cloth­ing rack and left.</p>
    <p>On Aug 14 last year, he posted the photos of the gar­ment on his In­sta­gram ac­count with a cap­tion stat­ing his lewd deed and the loca</p>
    <p>tion where he had com­mit­ted it.</p>
    <p>Lim deleted the photos soon af­ter re­ceiv­ing com­plaints from other In­sta­gram users.</p>
    <p>In a raid on Aug 16 last year, the po­lice found four ob­scene video clips on his mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Sean Teh told the court that Lim was found by the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health (IMH) to have a fetish con­cern­ing fe­male clothes, with a pref­er­ence for fe­male in­ti­mate wear.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing the court to im­pose a $5,000 fine on Lim, Mr Teh said that his In­sta­gram post had caused a “sig­nif­i­cant amount of an­noy­ance” to the pub­lic, with 38 po­lice re­ports be­ing lodged against him on the I-wit­ness on­line plat­form.</p>
    <p>De­fence lawyer David Na­yar said in mit­i­ga­tion that Lim has been un­der­go­ing psy­chi­atric ses­sions at IMH to ad­dress his fetish.</p>
    <p>In im­pos­ing a $2,400 fine on him, District Judge Tan noted that Lim had been in re­mand be­tween Au­gust and Septem­ber last year for his case.</p>
    <p>For his of­fence of caus­ing pub­lic nui­sance, he could have been fined up to $1,000.</p>
    <p>He could also have been jailed for up to 12 months and/or fined up to $40,000 for pos­sess­ing the four ob­scene films.</p>
