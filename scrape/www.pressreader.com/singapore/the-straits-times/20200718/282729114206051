    <p>The Toy­ota Prius PHV (plug-in hy­brid ve­hi­cle) of­fers around 50km of elec­tric range with the re­as­sur­ing backup of a fos­sil-fu­elled pow­er­train.</p>
    <p>Does com­bin­ing a large bat­tery and petrol tank put range anx­i­ety to rest? Or does it end up an un­sat­is­fac­tory com­pro­mise?</p>
    <p>First, here are my most salient ob­ser­va­tions about the car.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing two pow­er­trains add more weight. The Prius PHV is 125kg to 150kg heav­ier than a non­plug-in Prius, and has a much weaker elec­tric mo­tor than a pure elec­tric ve­hi­cle. As a re­sult, the car ends up be­ing less dy­namic com­pared with a pure elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) or a well-tuned petrol model.</p>
    <p>The size­able bat­tery pack sit­ting be­neath the boot floor also eats into the lug­gage space, which is some­thing that will not es­cape no­tice when you try to squash a fold­able pram un­der the hatch.</p>
    <p>The PHV at­tracts the same road tax as a non-plug-in Prius. A pure EV of the same size could draw a higher tax.</p>
    <p>Over the past three months, The Straits Times used and charged the car in var­i­ous ways.</p>
    <p>When the car was reg­u­larly and re­li­ably charged from a pri­vate power point in a landed property, not a drop of petrol was used.</p>
    <p>When it was not charged at all, the PHV still de­liv­ered an im­pres­sive fuel econ­omy fig­ure of 5.8 litres/ 100km, even when driven un­eco­nom­i­cally.</p>
    <p>The lighter non-plug-in Prius will prob­a­bly im­prove on this fig­ure if it is driven largely in the same man­ner, but it will not of­fer the op­tion of de­cent-range elec­tric mo­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>Things got in­ter­est­ing when the car was charged in­ter­mit­tently. The­o­ret­i­cally, you could achieve any­thing be­tween zero and 5.8 litres/ 100km. I man­aged 3.2 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>Along the way, I dis­cov­ered that Sin­ga­pore’s public charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture is suf­fi­ciently ac­ces­si­ble for now, con­sid­er­ing the cur­rent pop­u­la­tion of EVs here.</p>
    <p>There was a charg­ing point at a Shell sta­tion within 3.2km of my home and I also found one at a shop­ping cen­tre. But spend­ing two hours to charge a car at a petrol sta­tion re­quires com­mit­ment.</p>
    <p>Notably, the re­ward of earn­ing kilo­me­tres of elec­tric mo­tor­ing pales in com­par­i­son to what might be gained from rapid-charg­ing a pure EV.</p>
    <p>In fact, had I been us­ing a ded­i­cated EV and had ac­cess to a fast charger (the Prius PHV has no fast-charg­ing op­tion), the amount of the­o­ret­i­cal elec­tric range gleaned from the 31 / hours I</p>
    <p>2 spent charg­ing would have cov­ered the en­tire dis­tance driven that fort­night.</p>
    <p>Of course then I would not have the safety net of a petrol en­gine, which is crit­i­cal to a driver who de­pends on the public charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>With such a low charg­ing speed and ca­pac­ity, juic­ing up the PHV may make sense only if you do not have to go out of your way to do so.</p>
    <p>If you have ac­cess to a reg­u­lar three-point plug at your work­place, the PHV can run on bat­tery the days you go to work, and you can fall back on the petrol en­gine on the week­ends and hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>There is al­ready a sub­stan­tial num­ber of reg­u­lar Priuses on Sin­ga­pore’s roads.</p>
    <p>Which is the more sen­si­ble choice: a Prius PHV or a reg­u­lar Prius?</p>
    <p>That will depend on your life­style and if you think driv­ing a PHV or any EV is worth the trou­ble and time.</p>
