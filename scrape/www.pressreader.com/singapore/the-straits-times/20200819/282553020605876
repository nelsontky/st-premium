    <p>YouTu­ber and dee­jay Dee Kosh, whose real name is Dar­ryl Ian Koshy, has apol­o­gised for tex­ting a 15-year-old in a “prob­lem­atic” and “in­ap­pro­pri­ate” way.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral po­lice re­ports have been filed against him fol­low­ing a se­ries of sex­ual ha­rass­ment al­le­ga­tions by al­leged vic­tims, mostly young men, on In­sta­gram and Twit­ter over the week­end.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>“I now ad­mit that there is truth to some of the things which are be­ing said now and I am sorry to the peo­ple I have hurt in the process,” the 32-year-old wrote on In­sta­gram on Mon­day evening.</p>
    <p>Koshy back­tracked on an ear­lier state­ment last Satur­day, where he de­nied that he had sex­ual re­la­tions with a mi­nor, say­ing he would take the “nec­es­sary steps to clear this all up”.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quently, he en­gaged a lawyer, who is­sued a cease and de­sist let­ter to an al­leged vic­tim. The al­leged vic­tim then took down the posts.</p>
    <p>Among the ac­cu­sa­tions were that Koshy had so­licited nude pic­tures and of­fered money to mi­nors in ex­change for sex­ual favours.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral peo­ple also claimed Koshy had ap­proached them un­der the guise of re­cruit­ment, and posted screen­shots of their con­ver­sa­tions with him on Tele­gram and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>At least five al­leged vic­tims have posted con­ver­sa­tions on­line. In par­tic­u­lar, screen­shots of Koshy’s con­ver­sa­tion with the 15-year-old went vi­ral.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing these, Koshy wrote: “My tone was ques­tion­able, but there was ab­so­lutely no in­tent to groom him. Let me state cat­e­gor­i­cally that I did not ever have any sex­ual re­la­tions with him or any mi­nor.”</p>
    <p>He added: “To me, it was a friendly con­ver­sa­tion which was cheeky and in­ap­pro­pri­ate, but I did not take it any fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>He also de­nied that he had searched for paid sex on dat­ing apps or that he had used his tal­ent man­age­ment busi­ness to so­licit sex.</p>
    <p>He did not re­ply to queries from The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ra­dio sta­tion Power 98 FM, where Koshy hosts week­day night shows, is­sued a state­ment on Mon­day to say he is cur­rently on leave and that the sta­tion “does not tol­er­ate any form of ha­rass­ment”.</p>
    <p>Koshy, who first made a name for him­self with par­ody mu­sic videos and won no­tice for his stand-up comedy, has more than 380,000 sub­scribers to his YouTube chan­nel.</p>
