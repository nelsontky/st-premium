    <p>The $100 tourism vouch­ers that all adult Sin­ga­pore­ans will re­ceive from De­cem­ber are meant for per­sonal use only, said the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB).</p>
    <p>Asked if the vouch­ers could be trans­ferred or pooled to­gether, Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) brand direc­tor Lim Shoo Ling said the vouch­ers “must be used for their in­tended pur­poses so that us­age can be tracked and abuses such as fraud and re­sale can be avoided”.</p>
    <p>On how STB would en­force this rule, Ms Lim told The Straits Times that the agency is work­ing out the pa­ram­e­ters of the voucher scheme and will give more in­for­ma­tion in due course.</p>
    <p>The Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers, an­nounced in Au­gust, are meant to be spent on staycation­s, tick­ets to leisure at­trac­tions and lo­cal tours.</p>
    <p>The $320 mil­lion worth of vouch­ers – aimed at giv­ing lo­cal tourism busi­nesses a boost – will be pro­vided in de­nom­i­na­tions of $10 and users can de­cide how much to use for each of their pur­chases.</p>
    <p>They will be dis­trib­uted via SingPass, and can be used at all li­censed ho­tels, leisure at­trac­tions and for lo­cal tours by op­er­a­tors that STB has given the green light to re­open or re­sume.</p>
    <p>As of Mon­day, 219 ho­tels, 40 at­trac­tions and 609 tour itin­er­ar­ies have re­sumed op­er­a­tions, said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>Asked if the vouch­ers can be used for lo­cal re­tail such as shop­ping and food and bev­er­age out­lets, she said the tourism in­dus­try adds vi­brancy to the re­tail and F&B sec­tors.</p>
    <p>There are other sup­port mea­sures for the F&B and re­tail sec­tors, she said, adding that the agency hopes the vouch­ers will have a mul­ti­plier ef­fect on spend­ing at these mer­chants, when Sin­ga­pore­ans visit them while ex­plor­ing the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers and el­i­gi­ble mer­chants will get more in­for­ma­tion about el­i­gi­ble pro­mo­tions and prod­ucts in due course, she said.</p>
    <p>In a ra­dio in­ter­view with Money FM 89.3 on Mon­day morn­ing, Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Alvin Tan said many at­trac­tions and tours are start­ing to dig­i­talise or in­no­vate, to cap­ture do­mes­tic de­mand, es­pe­cially in the short term.</p>
    <p>On whether the Gov­ern­ment would mon­i­tor if the vouch­ers were dis­pro­por­tion­ately spent on ho­tels and staycation­s as com­pared with lo­cal tours – re­sult­ing in an “im­bal­ance in re­cov­ery” – Mr Tan said there will be trickle-down ef­fects as the vouch­ers are meant to stim­u­late de­mand.</p>
    <p>“We’re try­ing to cover the ground as much as pos­si­ble. We’re try­ing to look at ways... and in fact, help them to come up with pack­ages. So it just doesn’t ben­e­fit one seg­ment, but it ben­e­fits a whole tourism ecosys­tem.”</p>
