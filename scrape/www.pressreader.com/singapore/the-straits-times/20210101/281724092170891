    <p>• US health of­fi­cials ac­knowl­edged that a Covid-19 im­mu­ni­sa­tion cam­paign is crawl­ing out of the start­ing gate, rais­ing the prospect that the na­tion’s all-in bet on vac­cines could be af­flicted by the same dys­func­tion that hob­bled mea­sures to con­tain the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Only about 2.8 mil­lion Amer­i­cans had been vac­ci­nated as at Wed­nes­day evening. As the year drew to a close, that rep­re­sented only about 13.5 per cent of the au­thor­i­ties’ stated goal of im­mu­nis­ing 20 mil­lion Amer­i­cans by the end of last year</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments are strug­gling with com­plex lo­gis­tics to keep the</p>
    <p>shots cold, or­gan­is­ing co­horts of peo­ple to re­ceive them and per­suad­ing those made scep­ti­cal by a flood of on­line dis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is another man­i­fes­ta­tion of a lack of a fed­eral plan with ap­pro­pri­ate re­sources,” said Dr Robert Wachter, chair­man of the depart­ment of medicine at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>“With each pass­ing day, if vac­cines are sit­ting on shelves wait­ing to be ad­min­is­tered, those are peo­ple that will die be­cause of that.”</p>
    <p>Se­nior pub­lic health of­fi­cials said</p>
    <p>the vac­ci­na­tion pace will ac­cel­er­ate as soon as next week.</p>
    <p>Nurs­ing homes and other longterm care fa­cil­i­ties are likely to get more shots done as the hol­i­days re­cede, said Dr Nancy Mes­son­nier of the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC).</p>
    <p>States are im­pro­vis­ing new de­liv­ery sys­tems and rewriting pri­or­i­ties for who should get shots first.</p>
    <p>Colorado said on Wed­nes­day it would vac­ci­nate peo­ple aged 70 and older, join­ing Texas and Florida in try­ing to quickly im­mu­nise older res­i­dents – though fed­eral guide­lines favour health work­ers.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Julie Swann, a sup­ply­chain ex­pert at North Carolina State Univer­sity, said that pri­ori­tis­ing groups for ini­tial shots is an im­ped­i­ment.</p>
    <p>“We have mul­ti­ple com­pet­ing ob­jec­tives, and it is hard to sat­isfy them si­mul­ta­ne­ously,” she said.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral of­fi­cials said they will as­sess what is work­ing and what needs to be ad­justed.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Gus­tave Perna, leader of the lo­gis­tics ef­fort, said: “Here is what I have con­fi­dence in: Every day, ev­ery­body gets bet­ter, and I be­lieve that up­take will in­crease sig­nif­i­cantly as we go for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has said the ad­min­is­tra­tion is fail­ing to pro­tect Amer­i­cans, and has promised 100 mil­lion in­oc­u­la­tions in his first 100 days if Congress pro­vides fund­ing. But Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump made clear in a Wed­nes­day tweet that he be­lieves lo­cal of­fi­cials are in charge, telling states: “Get mov­ing!”</p>
    <p>New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo said the mas­sive un­der­tak­ing has been “grossly un­der­es­ti­mated”. Ohio Gov­er­nor Mike DeWine chas­tised providers for mov­ing slowly.</p>
    <p>Many Amer­i­cans are un­cer­tain if they will get a shot from their doc­tor, at a gov­ern­ment clinic or at a phar­macy. It is also un­clear how gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials will ver­ify el­i­gi­bil­ity. Some states and cities have launched web­sites where res­i­dents can sign up to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Texas this week opened up vac­ci­na­tion to se­niors aged at least 65 and peo­ple over 16 with an in­creased risk for se­vere ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Greg Ab­bott in a tweet urged vac­cine providers to quickly use shots be­cause a “sig­nif­i­cant por­tion” may be go­ing un­used.</p>
    <p>Dr Wachter, the Cal­i­for­nia med­i­cal pro­fes­sor, said states are mak­ing it up as they go.</p>
    <p>“These are big, com­plex un­der­tak­ings to get ma­te­ri­als out to mil­lions of peo­ple, thou­sands of places, and they re­ally do re­quire fed­eral co­or­di­na­tion, fed­eral pro­grammes and fed­eral dol­lars be­hind them,” he said. “If you don’t, you have ev­ery­body do­ing i mprov(isa­tion), and it just doesn’t work very well.”</p>
