    <p>Yishun res­i­dents can look for­ward to a new in­te­grated devel­op­ment at Chong Pang City that will have swim­ming pools, a gym and fit­ness stu­dios, as well as an up­graded hawker cen­tre and com­mu­nity club.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion of the 0.9ha devel­op­ment at Yishun New Town’s first neigh­bour­hood town cen­tre is slated to be com­pleted in 2027.</p>
    <p>The multi-storey devel­op­ment, which will be ten­ta­tively named Chill @ Chong Pang, will be lo­cated at the site of Chong Pang Com­mu­nity Club (CC) in Yishun Ring Road and Block 102 Yishun Av­enue 5. The CC will be re­de­vel­oped and the block ac­quired.</p>
    <p>The new devel­op­ment will also have space for com­mer­cial shops, and will pro­vide more park­ing space.</p>
    <p>Hawk­ers and stall­hold­ers from the ex­ist­ing Chong Pang Market and Food Cen­tre, which was built in 1984, can re­lo­cate to the new in­te­grated devel­op­ment when it is ready, said the Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity (SLA), the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency and Sport Sin­ga­pore in a joint me­dia state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ex­ist­ing hawker cen­tre, which is near the CC, when va­cated, will be re­de­vel­oped into a com­mu­nity plaza by 2028. There are cur­rently 179 stalls in the market and hawker cen­tre, com­pris­ing 56 cooked food stalls and 123 market stalls.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion of the new in­te­grated devel­op­ment is ex­pected to start in the sec­ond half of 2022. Chong Pang CC will close in the first half of 2022 to make way for con­struc­tion works, and re­open as part of the in­te­grated devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a vir­tual me­dia con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam, who is an MP for Nee Soon GRC, said the new devel­op­ment will be a more ef­fi­cient use of land space that can cater to the needs of res­i­dents in Yishun and the north­ern re­gion.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties also said that more in­ter­est­ing pro­grammes will be rolled out for res­i­dents at the devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said that all ex­ist­ing hawk­ers at Chong Pang Market will be of­fered re­place­ment stalls. Those cur­rently re­ceiv­ing sub­si­dies on rental will con­tinue to re­ceive sub­si­dies at the up­graded hawker cen­tre, while oth­ers pay­ing the market rate will con­tinue to do so.</p>
    <p>Hawk­ers can op­er­ate as usual at the cur­rent hawker cen­tre un­til the in­te­grated devel­op­ment is ready, he added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, shop own­ers and ten­ants at Block 102, a four-storey Hous­ing Board com­mer­cial block, will be af­fected, as the block will be ac­quired by SLA for the new devel­op­ment. It com­prises 17 shops on</p>
    <p>the first floor that had been sold to store­hold­ers, and 51 shops rented out by the HDB.</p>
    <p>The block has no res­i­den­tial units.</p>
    <p>SLA said that it will work closely with the af­fected shop own­ers and ten­ants at the block, and as­sist them through the ac­qui­si­tion process. They will have to move out by Dec 31 next year.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries, an SLA spokesman said the own­ers of the 17 shops on the first floor will be paid market value for the ac­quired prop­erty as at the date of the ac­qui­si­tion.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the market value of the ac­quired shop, they will also be com­pen­sated for rea­son­able ex­penses such as re­lo­ca­tion fees and stamp and le­gal fees for the re­place­ment prop­erty, if ap­pli­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>A pro­fes­sional pri­vate val­uer will also be ap­pointed to as­sist in deter­min­ing the market value of the ac­quired shops. SLA said it will con­sider the claims, if any, sub­mit­ted</p>
    <p>by the af­fected shop own­ers.</p>
    <p>Some own­ers of the af­fected shops hope the dead­line given for them to move out can be ex­tended. An owner of a bar­be­cued meat store at Block 102, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lim, asked to be given one or two more years to do so.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause we own our cur­rent store, we do not have to worry about pay­ing rent amid the un­cer­tain Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion. But there will be more fi­nan­cial un­cer­tainty for us if we have to move be­fore the cri­sis has blown over,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr David Lim, 56, who owns a sundry goods store at the Chong Pang market, said he is look­ing for­ward to mov­ing to the new devel­op­ment. “The new place will be cleaner and have more fa­cil­i­ties, and it is good that it will re­main at this cen­tral lo­ca­tion. We’ll prob­a­bly con­tinue to see many cus­tomers at the new fa­cil­ity.”</p>
