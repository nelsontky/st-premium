    <p>The Sin­ga­pore stock mar­ket felt pos­i­tive knock-on ef­fects of ris­ing in­vestor sen­ti­ment in the United States after a coro­n­avirus stim­u­lus Bill was passed, push­ing Wall</p>
    <p>Street in­dices to record highs on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>On the lo­cal bourse, the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) rose 0.3 per cent or eight points to fin­ish the day at 2,848.14. On the broader mar­ket, gain­ers out­num­bered losers 265 to 175, after 1.56 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth some $630 mil­lion changed hands.</p>
    <p>Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings and Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings were the top ad­vancers for the day. The for­mer gained 2.5 per cent or US$0.61 to US$25.41, while the lat­ter added 0.6 per cent or US$0.35 to fin­ish the day at US$55.70. On the other end of the spec­trum,</p>
    <p>ABR Hold­ings – which owns a num­ber of food and bev­er­age brands – was the top de­cliner. The stock fell 19.1 per cent or $0.13 to $0.55.</p>
    <p>Glove mak­ers were also among the big­gest de­clin­ers. Top Glove fell 3.9 per cent or $0.08 to $1.99; River­stone shed 1.8 per cent or $0.02 to $1.09, while UG Health­care fell 3.4 per cent or $0.02 to 57.5 cents.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ap­parel maker Medtecs In­ter­na­tional, too, fell 2.5 per cent or 2.5 cents to 99.5 cents.</p>
    <p>Oanda se­nior mar­ket an­a­lyst Jef­frey Hal­ley noted that glove mak­ers had led de­clines on the Kuala Lumpur stock mar­ket ear­lier in the day as well. “It may well be that in­vestors are start­ing to look at a post-vac­cine fu­ture and are light­en­ing up on a sec­tor that was a clear Covid-19 win­ner,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Among the 30 con­stituent coun­ters, Yangz­i­jiang Ship­build­ing emerged the big­gest loser after com­ing out tops on Mon­day. The stock closed at 93.5 cents, down 1.1 per cent or one cent. It was the most heav­ily traded STI stock for the sec­ond day in a row, with some 14.9 mil­lion shares traded over the course of the day.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the re­gion, stock mar­kets ended the day mixed.</p>
