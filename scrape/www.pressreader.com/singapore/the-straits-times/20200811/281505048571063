    <p>Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek is walk­ing away from its $4.1 bil­lion con­di­tional of­fer to buy con­trol of Kep­pel Corp.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter Kep­pel posted a sec­ond-quar­ter net loss of $697.6 mil­lion, breach­ing a pre­con­di­tion for Te­masek’s of­fer.</p>
    <p>Kyan­ite In­vest­ment Hold­ings, a unit of Te­masek, in­voked a ma­te­rial ad­verse change clause in pulling out of the deal, ac­cord­ing to a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Se­cu­ri­ties In­dus­try Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore said it has no ob­jec­tion to Te­masek in­vok­ing the clause and pulling out of the deal.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber last year, Te­masek of­fered to in­crease its one-fifth stake in Kep­pel to 51 per cent by buy­ing an ad­di­tional 30.6 per cent stake at $7.35 per share.</p>
    <p>But Kep­pel’s stock has tum­bled about 20 per cent this year amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek will pull out of its $4.1 bil­lion par­tial of­fer for Kep­pel Cor­po­ra­tion in the light of the con­glom­er­ate’s poor fi­nan­cial show­ing.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter Kep­pel re­ported last month that its sec­ond-quar­ter losses came in at $697.6 mil­lion, which breached a pre­con­di­tion for the par­tial buy­out.</p>
    <p>That led Te­masek to an­nounce ear­lier this month that it would de­cide on whether to pro­ceed with the deal by the end of this month.</p>
    <p>A bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day stated that Te­masek’s wholly owned sub­sidiary Kyan­ite In­vest­ment Hold­ings will in­voke what is known as a ma­te­rial ad­verse change clause and not go ahead with the of­fer.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, Te­masek, which al­ready owns about one-fifth of Kep­pel, of­fered to buy an ad­di­tional 30.6 per cent stake, sub­ject to a num­ber of key terms, in­clud­ing there be­ing no ma­te­rial ad­verse change in the group’s fi­nan­cial per­for­mance. Such clauses can be in­voked to end or rene­go­ti­ate deals.</p>
    <p>The clause in this of­fer states that Kep­pel’s profit af­ter tax must not fall by more than 20 per cent, or about $557 mil­lion, over the cu­mu­la­tive four quar­ters from the third quar­ter ended Septem­ber last year. This pre­con­di­tion was breached with the com­pany’s lat­est re­sults.</p>
    <p>The Se­cu­ri­ties In­dus­try Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore said it has no ob­jec­tion to Te­masek in­vok­ing the clause and pulling out of the deal.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel shares closed at $5.40 last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to walk away is “not un­rea­son­able”, although slightly ear­lier than ex­pected, CGSCIMB an­a­lyst Lim Siew Khee wrote in a note yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The move may have bear­ing on a widely an­tic­i­pated merger be­tween Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine and its ri­val Sem­b­corp Marine.</p>
    <p>In June, Te­masek backed a $2.1 bil­lion rights is­sue by Sem­bMarine which will also see it “de­merged” from parent Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>“Our hopes of a po­ten­tial merger be­tween the yards may not hap­pen so soon,” Ms Lim said.</p>
    <p>UBS an­a­lyst Ch­eryl Lee noted that even though Kep­pel al­ready trades be­low pre-of­fer lev­els, “we ex­pect fur­ther sell­ing pres­sure from liq­uid­ity flows”. She added that while most in­vestors agree that Kep­pel’s val­u­a­tions are at­trac­tive and that the off­shore and marine in­dus­try is strate­gic to Sin­ga­pore, the sec­tor needs restruc­tur­ing. “For Kep­pel’s share price to re-rate above our price tar­get, we think bold restruc­tur­ing is re­quired, re­gard­less of who the driver of these changes might be.”</p>
    <p>Mr Joel Ng, re­search head at in­vest­ment ser­vice firm KGI Se­cu­ri­ties, said there should not be any sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on Kep­pel’s longterm po­ten­tial as the firm “has man­aged to di­ver­sify be­yond off­shore and marine over the past decade, and is in a favourable po­si­tion to tap growth op­por­tu­ni­ties in Asia”.</p>
    <p>“We still be­lieve Te­masek will pro­ceed with the con­sol­i­da­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s off­shore and marine sec­tor, although it may have changed how to pro­ceed forward in the light of the im­pact of Covid-19 on as­set val­ues.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the scrapped bid, Kep­pel said last night that the par­tial of­fer was un­so­licited.</p>
    <p>“Kep­pel did not ne­go­ti­ate the terms of the par­tial of­fer, in­clud­ing the MAC (ma­te­rial ad­verse change) pre­con­di­tion,” it said in a state­ment, adding that there had been no cer­tainty that the pre­con­di­tions would be sat­is­fied or waived, and that the par­tial of­fer would be made.</p>
    <p>“Not­with­stand­ing the with­drawal of the par­tial of­fer, we in­tend to en­gage Te­masek, which re­mains our sin­gle largest share­holder, to ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties for strate­gic col­lab­o­ra­tion,” it added.</p>
    <p>A bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day stated that the in­vest­ment firm’s wholly owned sub­sidiary Kyan­ite In­vest­ment Hold­ings will in­voke... a ma­te­rial ad­verse change clause and not go ahead with the of­fer... The clause in this of­fer states that Kep­pel’s profit af­ter tax must not fall by more than 20 per cent... over the cu­mu­la­tive four quar­ters from the third quar­ter ended Septem­ber last year.</p>
