    <p>MANILA • Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has said that par­tial re­stric­tions in and around the cap­i­tal Manila will be kept for an­other month, to end-Sep­tem­ber, to tackle the ris­ing num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases and fur­ther ex­pand hospi­tal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte an­nounced the de­ci­sion in a late-night tele­vised ad­dress on Mon­day af­ter the health min­istry re­ported an­other 3,446 new cases of the coro­n­avirus and 38 fa­tal­i­ties that day, tak­ing the coun­try’s to­tal count to 220,819 cases with 3,558 deaths.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Fran­cisco Duque said the num­ber of daily re­ported cases “re­mains high”, cit­ing a need to in­ten­sify anti-Covid-19 mea­sures to slow the in­fec­tion rate, which is the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The time for cases to dou­ble has slowed to 12 to 13 days from seven days, Mr Duque said.</p>
    <p>Mr Car­l­ito Galvez, a former mil­i­tary chief in charge of the na­tional coro­n­avirus task force, said the govern­ment was work­ing to boost hospi­tal ca­pac­ity and would add 1,000 beds in Manila and nearby prov­inces, which ac­count for most of the cases.</p>
    <p>“We need to strengthen treat­ment fa­cil­i­ties, es­pe­cially ICU (in­ten­sive care units), given the pos­si­bil­ity of an in­crease in se­vere cases once we fur­ther open the econ­omy,” Mr Galvez said dur­ing the task force’s meet­ing with Pres­i­dent Duterte.</p>
    <p>Manila ended reim­posed strict lock­down mea­sures on Aug 19 to boost busi­ness ac­tiv­ity and the econ­omy, which fell into re­ces­sion for the first time in 29 years with a record slump in the se­cond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Most busi­nesses, in­clud­ing dine-in ser­vices will be al­lowed to re­open, Mr Harry Roque, Mr Duterte’s spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious ser­vices will con­tinue to be per­mit­ted with a max­i­mum at­ten­dance of 10 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple must also wear masks in pub­lic and ob­serve the one-me­tre so­cial dis­tanc­ing rule, while chil­dren, the el­derly and preg­nant women are urged to stay at home, Mr Roque said.</p>
