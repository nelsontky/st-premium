    <p>‘In­vest­ing’ in the lottery</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial plan­ners might roll their eyes in dis­be­lief but it is prob­a­bly fair to say that one of the key re­tire­ment strate­gies for many</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans is to bank on hit­ting the jack­pot in the lottery.</p>
    <p>Sadly, this is no laugh­ing mat­ter – al­most half of the 2,000 or so adult Sin­ga­pore­ans polled by OCBC Bank re­cently ad­mit­ted that gam­bling is one of the fi­nan­cial ac­tiv­i­ties they dab­bled in.</p>
    <p>There is noth­ing wrong in plac­ing small bets once in a while to see if Lady Luck will pay you a visit one day. Come Chi­nese New Year, it is al­most a rit­ual for many fam­i­lies to try to court the God of For­tune by bet­ting on the an­nual Hong Bao draw.</p>
    <p>But a line has to be drawn if bet­ting is seen as a way to earn back in­come that has been lost amid a pan­demic-in­duced re­ces­sion, which re­sulted in many los­ing their jobs or hav­ing their pay slashed.</p>
    <p>What is wor­ry­ing is that 44 per cent of the peo­ple aged 21 to 65 who re­sponded to the OCBC Fi­nan­cial Well­ness In­dex sur­vey about three months ago said they had “gam­bled more than they can af­ford to lose”.</p>
    <p>This sug­gests that the gam­bling is prob­a­bly be­ing done in des­per­a­tion to earn money rather than as</p>
    <p>a harm­less and en­joy­able pas­time every now and then to see if a wind­fall might come your way.</p>
    <p>If you re­ally think this is your only way of get­ting out of your fi­nan­cial mis­ery, try this ex­per­i­ment for a month. Just limit your­self to a $2 bet on Toto per draw and put the rest of your usual bets into a tin. If you are des­tined to win, your $2 bet will de­liver the re­turns – if you have been mon­i­tor­ing the win­ning pat­terns, you should have known that quite a num­ber of big win­ners were those who held “quick pick” num­bers</p>
    <p>that cost $1 per bet. By the end of the month, re­ward your­self by open­ing the tin so you can re­ceive your “win­nings” – the money that you would have lost pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>This ex­per­i­ment should make you re­alise that you stand to gain more by not gam­bling most of your money away.</p>
    <p>While gam­bling was the top “fi­nan­cial sin” iden­ti­fied in the sur­vey, there are a few other bad habits Sin­ga­pore­ans need to kick so that they stand a bet­ter chance of hav­ing a com­fort­able re­tire­ment.</p>
