    <p>It has been peace­ful for Cameron Diaz since she bid Hol­ly­wood’s glitz and glam­our good­bye.</p>
    <p>In a con­ver­sa­tion with fel­low ac­tress Gwyneth Pal­trow for the lat­ter’s In Goop Health pod­cast series, the 47-year-old for­mer ac­tress says she had found peace as she was fi­nally tak­ing care of her­self.</p>
    <p>Diaz is known for her roles in films in­clud­ing There’s Something About Mary (1998), Char­lie’s An­gels (2000) and Princess Fiona in the Shrek film series (2001 to 2010). Her act­ing ca­reer spans 20 years, be­gin­ning in 1994 and con­clud­ing with her ap­pear­ance in the 2014 mu­si­cal com­edy An­nie.</p>
    <p>She told her friend of nearly a decade: “I know a lot of peo­ple won’t un­der­stand it... but it’s so in­tense to work at that level and be that pub­lic and put your­self out there.”</p>
    <p>Diaz con­firmed her re­tire­ment from act­ing in 2018 and while she has not ruled out a re­turn to the sil­ver screen, she has been en­joy­ing her time away from the lime­light.</p>
    <p>She said: “I stopped and looked at my life. When you’re mak­ing a movie, they own you. You’re there for 12 hours a day for months on end. You have no time for any­thing else.</p>
    <p>“I needed to know that I could take care of my­self, that I knew how to be an adult.”</p>
    <p>Diaz mar­ried mu­si­cian Benji Mad­den in 2015 and the cou­ple had their first child, daugh­ter Rad­dix, in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>She cred­ited Pal­trow with en­cour­ag­ing her to be­come a mother, adding: “I would not have be­come a mother if it wasn’t for you.”</p>
    <p>Since she stepped back from act­ing, Diaz has writ­ten two books. The Body Book: Feed, Move, Un­der­stand And Love Your Amaz­ing Body (2013) was a New York Times best­seller.</p>
    <p>And she has also be­come a wine­maker. Along with en­tre­pre­neur Kather­ine Power, she launched her clean wine brand, Ava­line, ear­lier this year.</p>
