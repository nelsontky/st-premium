    <p>When Amer­i­can Jen­nifer Doudna was in sixth grade, she came home one day to find that her dad had left a pa­per­back ti­tled The Dou­ble</p>
    <p>Helix on her bed.</p>
    <p>She put it aside, think­ing it was one of those de­tec­tive tales she loved. When she read it on a rainy Satur­day, she dis­cov­ered she was right, in a way.</p>
    <p>As she sped through the pages, she be­came en­thralled by the in­tense drama, filled with colour­ful char­ac­ters, about am­bi­tion and com­pe­ti­tion in the pur­suit of na­ture’s won­ders. Even though her high school coun­sel­lor told her girls did not be­come sci­en­tists, she de­cided she would.</p>
    <p>She would help to make what the book’s au­thor James Wat­son later told her was the most im­por­tant bi­o­log­i­cal advance since he and Dr Fran­cis Crick dis­cov­ered the struc­ture of DNA.</p>
    <p>She worked with bril­liant Parisian bi­ol­o­gist Em­manuelle Char­p­en­tier to turn a cu­rios­ity of na­ture into an in­ven­tion that will trans­form the hu­man race – an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA.</p>
    <p>Known as Crispr, it ush­ered in a brave new world of med­i­cal mir­a­cles and moral ques­tions.</p>
    <p>For this ac­com­plish­ment, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in chem­istry on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It is a recog­ni­tion that the de­vel­op­ment of Crispr will has­ten our tran­si­tion to the next great in­no­va­tion rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The past half-cen­tury has been a dig­i­tal age, based on the mi­crochip, the com­puter and the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>Now we are en­ter­ing a life sci­ence era. Chil­dren who study dig­i­tal cod­ing will be joined by those who study the code of life.</p>
    <p>It will be a rev­o­lu­tion that will some day al­low us to cure dis­eases, fend off virus pan­demics and – if we de­cide it is wise – de­sign ba­bies with the ge­netic fea­tures we want for them.</p>
    <p>Crispr is es­pe­cially rel­e­vant in this year of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The gene-edit­ing tool that Dr Doudna and Dr Char­p­en­tier de­vel­oped is based on a virus-fight­ing trick used by bac­te­ria, which have been bat­tling viruses for bil­lions of years.</p>
    <p>In their DNA, bac­te­ria de­velop clus­tered re­peated se­quences, known as Crisprs, that can re­mem­ber and then de­stroy viruses that at­tack them.</p>
    <p>It is an im­mune sys­tem that can adapt it­self to fight each new wave of viruses – just what we need in an era that has been plagued by re­peated vi­ral epi­demics.</p>
    <p>The award is also a great tes­ta­ment to the grow­ing power of women in the life sciences.</p>
    <p>When scientist Rosalind Franklin made the images that helped Dr Wat­son and Dr Crick dis­cover the struc­ture of DNA, she be­came just a mi­nor char­ac­ter in the early his­to­ries, and she died be­fore she could share a Nobel Prize.</p>
    <p>Un­til now, only five women, be­gin­ning with Marie Curie in 1911, have won or shared the Nobel for chem­istry, out of 184 hon­ourees.</p>
    <p>When this year’s prize was an­nounced, Dr Char­p­en­tier said it would “pro­vide a mes­sage specif­i­cally to young girls who would like to fol­low the path of sci­ence and to show them that in friend­ship, women can also be awarded prizes”.</p>
    <p>Crispr is now be­ing used to treat sickle cell anaemia, can­cers and blind­ness. And this year, Dr Doudna and her re­search teams be­gan ex­plor­ing how Crispr could de­tect and de­stroy the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“Crispr evolved in bac­te­ria be­cause of their long-run­ning war against viruses,” Dr Doudna told me.</p>
    <p>“We hu­mans don’t have time to wait for our own cells to evolve nat­u­ral re­sis­tance to this virus, so we have to use our in­ge­nu­ity to do that.</p>
    <p>“Isn’t it fit­ting that one of the tools is this an­cient bac­te­rial im­mune sys­tem called Crispr? Na­ture is beau­ti­ful that way.”</p>
    <p>In 2018, Chi­nese scientist He Jiankui, who had been to some of Dr Doudna’s gene-edit­ing con­fer­ences, shocked the world by us­ing Crispr to help pro­duce the world’s first “de­signer ba­bies”.</p>
    <p>He edited hu­man em­bryos to re­move a gene that pro­duces a re­cep­tor for the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus that causes Aids.</p>
    <p>There was an im­me­di­ate out­burst of awe and then shock. Af­ter more than three bil­lion years of evo­lu­tion of life on this planet, one species – us – had de­vel­oped the tal­ent and temer­ity to grab con­trol of its own ge­netic fu­ture.</p>
    <p>There was a sense that we had crossed the thresh­old into a whole new age.</p>
    <p>Crispr raises some tough moral ques­tions. Should we edit our species to make us less sus­cep­ti­ble to deadly viruses?</p>
    <p>Amid this coro­n­avirus plague, most of us prob­a­bly think that would be a won­der­ful boon. Right?</p>
    <p>Should we elim­i­nate dis­or­ders such as Hunt­ing­ton’s dis­ease, sickle cell anaemia and cys­tic fi­bro­sis? That sounds good, too.</p>
    <p>And what about con­gen­i­tal deaf­ness or blind­ness? Or be­ing short? Or de­pressed? Hmm. How should we think about that?</p>
    <p>A few decades from now, if it be­comes pos­si­ble and safe, should we al­low par­ents to en­hance the IQ and phys­i­cal strength of their kids? Should we let them de­cide eye colour? Skin colour? Height?</p>
    <p>Af­ter help­ing to dis­cover Crispr, Dr Doudna has be­come a thought leader on these moral is­sues.</p>
    <p>That is the main mes­sage we should take from this year’s Nobel Prize in chem­istry: New tech­nolo­gies can be a huge ben­e­fit to the hu­man race, but to make sure they are used wisely, it is im­por­tant for peo­ple to un­der­stand them.</p>
    <p>By shin­ing a light on gene edit­ing, the Nobel com­mit­tee is bring­ing a needed aware­ness of the won­ders of na­ture – and of the tech­nol­ogy that will in­creas­ingly de­ter­mine how na­ture works.</p>
