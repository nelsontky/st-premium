    <p>NEW YORK • The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s East­ern Con­fer­ence is more open than ever, com­ing off a sea­son in which an up­start fifth seed made it to the Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>At least one team are vir­tu­ally guar­an­teed to vault into the top tier from medi­ocrity: The Brook­lyn Nets, given that Kevin Du­rant and Kyrie Irv­ing are ex­pected to re­turn from in­jury for the new sea­son. But other­wise, it should be a slugfest from start to fin­ish.</p>
    <p>There will be lots of eyes on the plight of Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo and his ten­ure with the Mil­wau­kee Bucks, not to men­tion the be­gin­ning of the Doc Rivers era in Philadel­phia. And maybe this is the year the New York Knicks make progress?</p>
    <p>To all the East­ern Con­fer­ence gen­eral man­agers, here is a sug­ges­tion for one thing your team have to do this off sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Con­tenders MI­AMI HEAT</p>
    <p>Com­ing off an un­ex­pect­edly strong sea­son, they are in a great po­si­tion. They have young tal­ent, a star in Jimmy But­ler, sig­nif­i­cant cap space and the 20th pick in the draft.</p>
    <p>But if the Heat are to make it back to the Fi­nals, they will need more con­sis­tent play­mak­ing out­side of But­ler. They have three sig­nif­i­cant play­ers en­ter­ing free agency – guard Go­ran Dragic, cen­tre Mey­ers Leonard and wing Jae Crow­der. The cap space, how­ever, gives the Heat flex­i­bil­ity to pur­sue an­other play­maker to team with But­ler – Vic­tor Oladipo, per­haps?</p>
    <p>BOS­TON CELTICS</p>
    <p>Bos­ton need scor­ing help off the bench. Much of their off sea­son hinges on whether Gor­don Hay­ward opts into his roughly US$34 mil­lion (S$46 mil­lion) con­tract for next year, so the one way to con­cretely get play­mak­ing help is through the draft, where Bos­ton have picks No. 14, 26 and 30.</p>
    <p>Given Bos­ton’s cham­pi­onship as­pi­ra­tions and the un­likely chance of get­ting some­one who can con­trib­ute right away with late-round picks, Danny Ainge, the team’s pres­i­dent of bas­ket­ball, should ex­plore trad­ing up.</p>
    <p>BROOK­LYN NETS</p>
    <p>The Nets have no cap space, but they es­sen­tially get to see their off­sea­son moves from last sum­mer come to fruition now, with Du­rant and Irv­ing (right) re­turn­ing from in­juries.</p>
    <p>Their big ac­qui­si­tion this sum­mer was Steve Nash, their new head coach. Un­less the Nets are will­ing to trade some of their young tal­ent – wing Caris LeVert, guard Spencer Din­wid­die and cen­tre Jar­rett Allen – there is no third star com­ing.</p>
    <p>That means the Nets need to re­sign Joe Har­ris, an un­re­stricted free agent. With two ball-dom­i­nant stars, the Nets would ben­e­fit from hav­ing a sharp­shooter on the perime­ter.</p>
    <p>PHILADEL­PHIA 76ERS</p>
    <p>Solve the Al Hor­ford prob­lem. Ac­cord­ing to the NBA’s track­ing num­bers, there is some ev­i­dence that play­ing Hor­ford and Joel Em­biid to­gether can work. The team’s mos­tused line-up of Hor­ford, Tobias Har­ris, Em­biid, Josh Richard­son and Ben Sim­mons outscored op­pos­ing line-ups by 8.5 points per 100 pos­ses­sions.</p>
    <p>But the league is trend­ing to­wards smaller line-ups, and it is not clear that dou­bling down on mul­ti­ple big men on the floor is go­ing to work over a full sea­son. It didn’t last year. To that end, when Hor­ford and Em­biid were on the floor to­gether, the team were 0.5 point worse per 100 pos­ses­sions over­all, and both men played bet­ter when the other one was off the floor.</p>
    <p>TORONTO RAPTORS</p>
    <p>Fred VanVleet, Serge Ibaka and Marc Ga­sol are all un­re­stricted free agents. Kyle Lowry is en­ter­ing the last year of his con­tract. At the very least, the Raptors have to re-sign VanVleet, and likely will.</p>
    <p>MIL­WAU­KEE BUCKS</p>
    <p>Build an An­te­tok­oun­mpo statue out­side the arena now so he feels too guilty to leave in free agency next sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The Maybes IN­DI­ANA PAC­ERS</p>
    <p>Oladipo has not pub­licly asked for a trade, but there is enough smoke fly­ing around that there is prob­a­bly fire. This al­ways goes the same way: First, there are ru­mours of dis­con­tent. Then there is a leak of a</p>
    <p>trade re­quest. And then the team are forced to make a trade with min­i­mal lever­age.</p>
    <p>The Pac­ers should trade Oladipo now be­fore the in­evitable trade re­quest. At 28, he isn’t a top-tier star and has made just two All-Star games. The Pac­ers had the right idea in ac­quir­ing him in the 2017 Paul Ge­orge-trade with Ok­la­homa City, es­pe­cially be­cause they also re­ceived Do­man­tas Sabo­nis, 24, in the deal. But Sabo­nis, who made his first All-Star team last sea­son, may end up be­ing the bet­ter player of the two.</p>
    <p>DETROIT PISTONS</p>
    <p>The Pistons have lots of cap room, the sev­enth pick in the draft and a star in Blake Grif­fin, who is still in his prime and with lots left to prove. They need to ei­ther trade Grif­fin and com­mit to re­build­ing or use the cap space to land a star.</p>
    <p>Clip­pers for­ward Mon­trezl Har­rell would be an ideal tar­get. Maybe the Washington Wizards’ Davis Ber­tans.</p>
    <p>AT­LANTA HAWKS</p>
    <p>They were one of the worst de­fen­sive teams in the league last year, so if the Hawks want to vault, they need some help on that side of the ball. At­lanta are on track to have the most cap space in the league.</p>
    <p>They have two of the bet­ter young play­ers in the NBA in</p>
    <p>Trae Young and John Collins; the sixth pick in the draft; and sev­eral ca­pa­ble sup­port­ing play­ers, in­clud­ing Clint Capela.</p>
    <p>With ex­ten­sions ap­proach­ing for Young and the oth­ers, the Hawks have to use the cap space now. But on whom? Sign­ing some­one like Dwight Howard would be ideal. Same for Hay­ward if he opts out of his deal with Bos­ton, be­cause he can play on both sides of the ball.</p>
    <p>The Maybe-nots OR­LANDO MAGIC</p>
    <p>The Magic have lots of tal­ent but none in the top-tier. It is hard to jump to cham­pi­onship sta­tus with­out it, and Aaron Gor­don isn’t cut­ting it. They won’t have much, if any, cap space this sum­mer, but it is time to see what the trade mar­ket is for Gor­don.</p>
    <p>CHAR­LOTTE HOR­NETS</p>
    <p>Owner Michael Jor­dan needs to nail the third pick in the draft. If he doesn’t, ev­ery­one should point it out so he takes it per­son­ally, re­turns as a player and wins an­other cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON WIZARDS</p>
    <p>The Wizards may have a lit­tle bit of cap room to play with this fall, even with nearly US$70 mil­lion com­mit­ted to John Wall and Bradley Beal.</p>
    <p>But that is only if the Wizards</p>
    <p>don’t pay Ber­tans, who is due for a big raise as an un­re­stricted free agent. Can Ber­tans, even with his shoot­ing abil­ity, be the third-best player on a team look­ing to make noise in a com­pet­i­tive con­fer­ence?</p>
    <p>Even with Wall and Beal, it might be best to let him go.</p>
    <p>CHICAGO BULLS</p>
    <p>They have the No. 4 pick. Even in what is said to be a weak draft, there is likely long-term cor­ner­stone po­ten­tial in a player in this pool. The three most talked about prospects are James Wise­man, LaMelo Ball and An­thony Ed­wards.</p>
    <p>The Bulls haven’t had a sig­nif­i­cant A-level build­ing block since Derrick Rose, and there is not a sin­gle one on the team cur­rently.</p>
    <p>Ar­turas Kar­niso­vas should con­sider trad­ing the pick, and pack­age it with one of the younger prospects on the team (Lauri Markka­nen or Wen­dell Carter) to see if ei­ther Min­nesota, Golden State or Char­lotte will bite.</p>
    <p>CLEVE­LAND CAVA­LIERS</p>
    <p>Kevin Love and An­dre Drum­mond, who opted in to the last year of his con­tract af­ter be­ing traded from Detroit, are not go­ing to work play­ing to­gether. Free Love!</p>
    <p>NEW YORK KNICKS</p>
    <p>Go three months with­out feud­ing with film direc­tor and Knicks su­per­fan Spike Lee. NYTIMES</p>
