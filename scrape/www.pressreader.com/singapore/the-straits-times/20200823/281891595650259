    <p>The crowd pe­ri­od­i­cally broke into shouts of “USA! USA!” and “Four more years!” as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump drew stark bat­tle lines in his first de­tailed pub­lic re­marks on the just-con­cluded Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion (DNC).</p>
    <p>“I’m the only thing stand­ing be­tween the Amer­i­can Dream and to­tal anar­chy, mad­ness and chaos,” he told the au­di­ence at the con­ser­va­tive Coun­cil for Na­tional Policy, in Ar­ling­ton, Vir­ginia, on Fri­day morning.</p>
    <p>And he warned once again, ex­plic­itly, that the Nov 3 elec­tion re­sult may not be known for weeks. The Demo­cratic Party was in­tent on steal­ing the elec­tion, he in­sisted.</p>
    <p>At the DNC, former vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den and run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris were sealed as the party’s can­di­dates for an elec­tion that prom­ises to be the most fraught and con­se­quen­tial in the modern history of the United States, with sharply dif­fer­ent vi­sions for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Party is equally con­vinced that Mr Trump is in­tent on steal­ing the elec­tion – or will not ac­cept the re­sult if he loses.</p>
    <p>His re­marks – some of his strong­est yet – came as the Repub­li­can Party read­ies for its own na­tional con­ven­tion this week. He is ex­pected to de­liver a speech ac­cept­ing the nom­i­na­tion this Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“The Democrats... spent four straight days at­tack­ing Amer­ica as racist and a hor­ri­ble coun­try that must be re­deemed,” he charged.</p>
    <p>“And yet, look at what we’ve ac­com­plished.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump laid out a list of achieve­ments, in­clud­ing build­ing sev­eral miles of a wall on the border with Mex­ico, get­ting out of the Paris Agree­ment on curb­ing cli­mate change and re­viv­ing Amer­ica’s oil and gas in­dus­try, cut­ting taxes, and rolling back en­vi­ron­men­tal reg­u­la­tions that are oner­ous for farm­ers.</p>
    <p>On the for­eign front, he listed the US’ de­feat of the Is­lamic State in</p>
    <p>Iraq and Syria and the killing of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Bagh­dadi; his with­drawal from the Iran nu­clear deal and killing of Quds Force com­man­der Qasem Soleimani; his mov­ing the US Em­bassy in Is­rael from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; recog­ni­tion of Is­raeli sovereignt­y over the Golan Heights; and this month’s deal be­tween Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>And the ad­min­is­tra­tion has taken “his­toric ac­tion to stand up to China’s trade cheat­ing and plun­der­ing”, he said. If Mr Bi­den won, China would “own” the US, he charged.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent ac­cused the Demo­cratic Party of be­ing anti-re­li­gion, bent on tak­ing away the con­sti­tu­tional right to bear arms, de­fund­ing or abol­ish­ing the po­lice, and of “tear­ing down Amer­ica”.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture of our coun­try, and in­deed our civil­i­sa­tion, is at stake on Novem­ber 3rd,” he said, paint­ing a grim pic­ture of a Bi­den pres­i­dency pulled to the far left by rad­i­cals in the Demo­cratic Party who would raise taxes and be weak on crime and bor­ders and im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>“It will be a to­tally dif­fer­ent coun­try... and ul­ti­mately, it will fail,” he said. “Eco­nom­i­cally, it can’t work. We’ll go into a de­pres­sion... your stocks will crash.”</p>
    <p>Fo­cus­ing on the vul­ner­a­bil­ity of mail-in bal­lots to fraud, he told the au­di­ence: “You’re not go­ing to be able to know the end of this elec­tion, in my opin­ion, for weeks, months – maybe never.</p>
    <p>“Once you go past the first week, you’re never go­ing to know.”</p>
    <p>It is a theme he has re­peat­edly em­pha­sised, cit­ing 51 mil­lion mail-in bal­lots that he main­tains are be­ing sent to vot­ers, some of whom do not ex­ist. Some states have uni­ver­sal mail-in bal­lots, now more im­por­tant, given the risks of min­gling at polling booths amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There have been some is­sues with them: In Ne­vada, for in­stance, Clark County mailed bal­lots for its June pri­mary elec­tion to all its reg­is­tered vot­ers, but 223,000 were never de­liv­ered. But the fig­ure of 51 mil­lion cited by the Pres­i­dent re­mains hotly de­bated.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Party is in favour of and wants ex­pan­sion of mail-in bal­lot­ing, which has been stan­dard prac­tice in Amer­i­can elec­tions.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump has seized on this, dis­cred­it­ing the process, and re­in­forc­ing fears that he will not ac­cept the re­sult of the elec­tion if he loses.</p>
    <p>“It will be a tremen­dous em­bar­rass­ment to our coun­try. It’ll go on for­ever, and you’ll never know who won,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is a very, very se­ri­ous prob­lem, and some­thing has to be done about it,” he warned.</p>
    <p>And di­rectly ad­dress­ing the me­dia in the room, he said: “I say this for the me­dia: This will be the great­est catas­tro­phe – one of the great­est catas­tro­phes in the history of our coun­try. That’s how se­ri­ous it is.</p>
    <p>“And they also think I’m try­ing to steal an elec­tion. Just the op­po­site: I want the fair re­sults of an elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>SOLE DE­FENDER</p>
    <p>I’m the only thing stand­ing be­tween the Amer­i­can Dream and to­tal anar­chy, mad­ness and chaos. ’’</p>
