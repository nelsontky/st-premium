    <p>For Tai­wanese-Korean singer-song­writer Sun Shengxi (left), win­ning the Best Man­darin Al­bum ac­co­lade at the 2019 Golden Melody Awards was great, but it was not an end point in it­self. Sun, who sings about her quest to achieve more in her lat­est al­bum, says she is of­ten not sat­is­fied with the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>For Tai­wanese-Korean singer-song­writer Sun Shengxi, win­ning the Best Man­darin Al­bum ac­co­lade at the 2019 Golden Melody Awards i n Tai­wan was great, but it was not an end point in it­self.</p>
    <p>Sun, who is also known as Shi Shi, sings about her never-end­ing quest to achieve more in her lat­est al­bum Where Is Shi?, re­leased last month.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Man­darin to Sin­ga­pore me­dia re­cently, she says she is of­ten not sat­is­fied with the sta­tus quo, be it how much money she makes or how suc­cess­ful her mu­sic is.</p>
    <p>“I tell my­self to be con­tent, but when­ever I get some re­sults, I feel I want to do bet­ter. It is a con­tra­dic­tion, but not be­ing sat­is­fied pushes me to move for­ward.”</p>
    <p>She shot to fame after com­ing in sixth in the sec­ond sea­son of Tai­wanese singing re­al­ity com­pe­ti­tion Chi­nese Mil­lion Star in 2013.</p>
    <p>Since her fourth al­bum Shi’s Jour­ney nabbed the pres­ti­gious award in 2019, ex­pec­ta­tions are high, she ad­mits.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery ac­tion I take, be it writ­ing a melody or de­cid­ing how a song is de­vel­oped, I think about how to do it bet­ter than the last time. The stress is there.”</p>
    <p>With her new al­bum, she is go­ing all out for this year’s Golden Melody Awards, de­scribed as the Gram­mys of Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>She has said she is eye­ing the Best Fe­male Vo­cal­ist cat­e­gory, but adds that “get­ting nom­i­nated in any cat­e­gory is a great form of af­fir­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>There is a dis­tinct R&B sound in Sun’s new al­bum, a nod to the in­flu­ence of R&B artistes such as Ali­cia Keys, Bey­once and Usher.</p>
    <p>The track Not Enough is in the style of 2000s R&B, fea­tur­ing a groovy gui­tar, and is co-pro­duced by Tai­wanese rap­per Ra­zor Chi­ang.</p>
    <p>An­other song, In­fected, which likens love to a disease spread­ing in one’s body, has a smooth, un­du­lat­ing melody ac­com­pa­nied by soul­ful strings.</p>
    <p>Sun says: “I have al­ways known my singing style leans to­wards R&B, from my vi­brato to the way my voice changes be­tween reg­is­ters. But I have not been able to do a proper R&B al­bum un­til now. So in this al­bum, I feel es­pe­cially like my­self.”</p>
    <p>Sun, who is sin­gle, turned 30 last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>She hopes to do more mu­sic ar­range­ment in the new year and also take bet­ter care of her­self and per­haps keep fewer late nights.</p>
    <p>A longer-term goal, which she talked about in a re­cent in­ter­view, is to get mar­ried and have two or three chil­dren.</p>
    <p>But, first, the right per­son has to come along.</p>
    <p>She says: “I am the sort who will be the first to make my in­ten­tions known, but this may frighten the other party off.”</p>
    <p>She may have a long to-do list, but Sun is tak­ing it all in her stride. As she puts it: “Ac­tu­ally, I don’t need to be in such a hurry to ac­com­plish ev­ery­thing. After all, my 30s have just started.”</p>
    <p>I tell my­self to be con­tent, but when­ever I get some re­sults, I feel I want to do bet­ter. It is a con­tra­dic­tion, but not be­ing sat­is­fied pushes me to move for­ward.</p>
