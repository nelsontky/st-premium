    <p>We re­fer to Mr Lim Choo Beng’s let­ter (Telco’s se­niors’ of­fer dis­ap­points, Sept 11).</p>
    <p>We con­tacted Mr Lim and un­der­stand that he was not able to make phone calls with a par­tic­u­lar smart­phone model us­ing the TPG SIM card.</p>
    <p>This was be­cause he was us­ing the TPG SIM card on an older smart­phone that does not sup­port Voice over Long Term Evo­lu­tion (VoLTE) tech­nol­ogy. VoLTE refers to voice calls tak­ing place on the 4G net­work rather than the older 2G or 3G net­work. VoLTE of­fers bet­ter voice qual­ity.</p>
    <p>There were no is­sues with his TPG ac­count or SIM card.</p>
    <p>The TPG mo­bile net­work is li­censed for the roll-out of 4G. This means that tra­di­tional voice calls can be made only through mo­bile phones that sup­port VoLTE tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>While most newer 4G mo­bile phones in Sin­ga­pore sup­port VoLTE, some hand­sets do not have up­dated VoLTE set­tings as manda­tory cer­ti­fi­ca­tion on mo­bile net­works is not nec­es­sary in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>TPG has cre­ated an easy-to-use 4G voice app called TPG 4G Voice to sup­port users who are us­ing non-VoLTE com­pat­i­ble de­vices.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to pop­u­lar mes­sag­ing plat­forms like What­sApp, users can make and re­ceive calls through the app so long as there is data con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>For mak­ing emer­gency calls such as to 911 and 995, TPG users with non-VoLTE phones also need to use the TPG 4G Voice app. The app can be down­loaded from the Google Play Store and Ap­ple’s App Store, and in­stalled like any other app.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing to use the app for reg­u­lar phone calls can be in­con­ve­nient and con­fus­ing for less tech-savvy se­niors.</p>
    <p>The other tel­cos here do not face this prob­lem be­cause voice calls are gen­er­ally routed through their older 3G net­works when nec­es­sary. TPG does not have this older 3G net­work, plac­ing us at a dis­ad­van­tage and mak­ing it in­con­ve­nient for our users to make and re­ceive calls.</p>
    <p>We urge the au­thor­i­ties to look into this mat­ter and man­date that 4G mo­bile phones in Sin­ga­pore be VoLTE cer­ti­fied on all mo­bile net­works to level the play­ing field, and to re­move the con­fu­sion and in­con­ve­nience for con­sumers here.</p>
    <p>This is also to al­low the pub­lic, es­pe­cially se­niors who may be less dig­i­tally in­clined, to call emer­gency num­bers with ease.</p>
