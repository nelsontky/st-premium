    <p>I think I saw in Haw Par Villa’s Hell ex­hibit – be­tween the stat­ues ded­i­cated to pun­ish­ments for un­fil­ial chil­dren and thieves – a statue for sons who spend large sums on tac­tile key­boards, low-la­tency mon­i­tors and branded ca­bles.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral months ago, in this space, I wrote about tech im­prove­ments you can make to your work-from-home set-up.</p>
    <p>Now into the eighth month of WFH (work from home), and a drinker of my own Kool-aid, I have turned my work space into a palace of in­dus­try – a tes­ta­ment to my urge to op­ti­mise ev­ery­thing un­til it breaks.</p>
    <p>My desk is a tow­er­ing zig­gu­rat of stacked com­puter mon­i­tors, key­boards, ca­bles, cup hold­ers and tiered shelv­ing, but with more cool fea­tures.</p>
    <p>And what have I learnt? I re­alise I en­joy tweak­ing my work set-up a mil­lion times more than I en­joy do­ing work. Also, I saw that ev­ery­thing I knew was in­cor­rect, or at least mis­guided.</p>
    <p>First is the idea that a good set-up is a good-look­ing set-up. Look, I am not the neat­est per­son around – I would go so far as to say I would not be the neat­est per­son at a hoard­ers’ con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>But when I check out YouTube videos of tech gu­rus with drool-wor­thy desk con­fig­u­ra­tions, I see hectares of pris­tine white desk­top, in­vis­i­ble ca­bles, mon­i­tors seem­ingly hov­er­ing in the air like en­chanted flow­ers and an­gled just so – all framed by two potted plants with an op­ti­mised num­ber of leaves.</p>
    <p>Even ac­count­ing for the fact that they are YouTu­bers whose sub­scriber counts de­pend on vis­ual ap­peal, it seems un­likely that their set-up is prac­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, ca­bles bun­dled and tucked away are a night­mare to un­bun­dle should you want to add or re­move some­thing. I know this be­cause of the time I had to take the Ap­ple Watch charger for an over­seas trip, then plug it in again when I came back.</p>
    <p>Each op­er­a­tion left me shaken and sweaty. Now, I know I can buy a spare charger for travel, but two things must be noted.</p>
    <p>One: Ap­ple makes the charg­ing plate (the thing that sticks to the back of the watch) and the USB cable as one piece, so users can­not de­tach the plate to use with any old USB cable.</p>
    <p>Two: Cheap third-party Ap­ple Watch charg­ers are likely to be duds – ask me how I know – so we are stuck with cer­ti­fied charg­ers which can cost al­most as much as the Ap­ple-branded ones.</p>
    <p>A check with the Ap­ple on­line store shows me that the watch charger with a one-me­tre cable costs $45. Want another me­tre of length? Fork out another $14.</p>
    <p>The per­son who came up with the ad­di­tional cop­per-cost cal­cu­lus at the com­pany must also work at its mem­ory di­vi­sion, based on the markups for iPhone and MacBook mod­els with larger ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>I have adored Ap­ple prod­ucts for decades and my pur­chases should have bankrolled enough of the new Cal­i­for­nia campus that it would only be fair to have the can­teen named af­ter me.</p>
    <p>But I do not think I can pay that much for a cable and still stand tall in front of my Chi­nese an­ces­tors in the other realm.</p>
    <p>I think I saw in Haw Par Villa’s Hell ex­hibit – be­tween the stat­ues ded­i­cated to pun­ish­ments for un­fil­ial chil­dren and thieves – a statue for sons who spend large sums on tac­tile key­boards, low-la­tency mon­i­tors and branded ca­bles.</p>
    <p>This is why I just leave my ca­bles swing­ing free. Yes, I am “free-ca­blin’ it”, as they say. This is as na­ture in­tended, so the elec­trons bring­ing data and power flow are freer and hap­pier, and I know this be­cause my mon­i­tors now glow with a more cheer­ful hue.</p>
    <p>You can hate me for be­ing an Ap­ple fan­boy all you like, but I al­ready know I am sick and be­yond help – my slide into poverty will, at least, be marked by el­e­gant pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>A new vista opened up when WFH be­came wide­spread: the abil­ity to do work any­where.</p>
    <p>Cafes, the beach, the cof­fee shop down­stairs and hawker cen­tre up the road were all ter­ri­to­ries open for takeover by un­leashed of­fice drones.</p>
    <p>For a story, I checked into a ho­tel of­fer­ing a suite for day use, for those seek­ing respite from home offices. I took just one lap­top. With­out Twit­ter on one screen, a video play­ing in another and one more win­dow on standby for a chat on Google Han­gouts, I was paral­ysed. Brain freeze.</p>
    <p>I tried a ver­sion of the pop­u­lar Po­modoro time-man­age­ment tech­nique by split­ting work into 25-minute time chunks sep­a­rated by five-minute breaks.</p>
    <p>That failed be­cause the tech­nique re­quires the very thing I am try­ing to re­gain with it: men­tal fo­cus.</p>
    <p>I now know what it is. My over-com­pli­cated desk set-up is de­signed to in­ject mi­cro-bursts of dis­trac­tion. It is a drug on which my brain’s synapses now rely, or they stop fir­ing.</p>
    <p>Eight months of WFH have turned me into a junkie, chained to my desk, much more than work­ing from the of­fice ever had.</p>
    <p>Oh, the irony.</p>
