    <p>More needs to be done to sup­port care­givers who may strug­gle to look af­ter a fam­ily mem­ber with men­tal health con­di­tions and other is­sues, said lawyers with ex­pe­ri­ence in such cases.</p>
    <p>While in­ter­ven­tion and treat­ment for men­tal health con­di­tions seem like sim­ple so­lu­tions, lawyers said the law now has pro­vi­sions to or­der a psy­chi­atric as­sess­ment to di­ag­nose men­tal health is­sues only when some­one has com­mit­ted or is sus­pected of com­mit­ting a crime.</p>
    <p>But some­times, it is a lit­tle too late for in­ter­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, Mr Tan Tian Chye hit his men­tally ill daugh­ter with a pole and stran­gled her to death af­ter feel­ing over­whelmed by the im­mense pres­sure of car­ing for her.</p>
    <p>A psy­chi­atric re­port found that Mr Tan, 66, had a ma­jor de­pres­sive episode and sig­nif­i­cant care­giver stress while try­ing to pacify the needs of Ms De­siree Tan Ji­ap­ing, 35, court doc­u­ments said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan was assessed in 2012 to have panic at­tacks with ago­ra­pho­bia – a con­di­tion that made her anx­ious in un­fa­mil­iar en­vi­ron­ments, and “hypochon­dri­a­cal pre­oc­cu­pa­tions” or anx­i­eties linked to health.</p>
    <p>She was also di­ag­nosed in 2018 with an un­spec­i­fied anx­i­ety dis­or­der but re­fused med­i­ca­tion – she was afraid she would be­come de­pen­dent on it. Last Mon­day, Mr Tan was sen­tenced to two years and nine months in jail but the sen­tence was back­dated so he was re­leased on the same day.</p>
    <p>High Court judge Hoo Sheau Peng in court pa­pers said: “As a so­ci­ety, it is crit­i­cal to con­tinue with ef­forts to im­prove and en­hance ac­cess to men­tal health ser­vices. It is un­for­tu­nate that much needed help, sup­port and in­ter­ven­tion were not sought by or given to the Tan fam­ily dur­ing those years for their daugh­ter, and there­after, for the ac­cused.”</p>
    <p>While sup­port can be given to those who ask for it, lawyers said un­der the law, no one can be forced to be assessed or get treat­ment for men­tal health is­sues un­less they do some­thing dan­ger­ous to them­selves or oth­ers.</p>
    <p>For those who have been di­ag­nosed with men­tal ill­ness, the court can or­der treat­ment only af­ter the per­son is sen­tenced for a crime.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran lawyer Amo­lat Singh said: “On one hand, this makes sense be­cause then any­one can point the fin­ger and ask for some­one to be re­manded, and we’re talk­ing about tak­ing away some­one’s lib­er­ties here. The ques­tion is, how do you cre­ate checks and bal­ances that won’t be abused. What should be the trig­ger­ing mech­a­nism for a per­son to be sent for treat­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mr Su­nil Sud­heesan, the head of the crim­i­nal de­part­ment at Quahe Woo & Palmer, said the ques­tion of when to in­ter­vene is a grey area since those suf­fer­ing from men­tal</p>
    <p>ill­nesses do not al­ways pose an im­me­di­ate dan­ger to them­selves or some­one else.</p>
    <p>He said: “The first thing is for care­givers to know how they can re­ceive help. The next thing is to con­sider var­i­ous forms of in­ter­ven­tion and where to peg that in­ter­ven­tion, mean­ing how to in­ter­vene and when the line is crossed. Now, it seems like se­ri­ous in­ter­ven­tion only takes place when a crime oc­curs. This may be too re­ac­tionary.”</p>
    <p>Lawyers said Mr Tan’s case is not the first time care­givers have felt out of their depth deal­ing with a fam­ily mem­ber with men­tal health or other con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in 2014, a mother of a seven-year-old autis­tic boy pushed him out of the win­dow of their ninth-floor Tampines flat af­ter she was seized by thoughts that he was the rea­son for her ex­haus­tion and mar­i­tal prob­lems.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the 43-year-old woman was sen­tenced to five years’ jail for cul­pa­ble homi­cide. She was found to have suf­fered a re­lapse of a ma­jor de­pres­sive dis­or­der she had faced since 2008.</p>
    <p>Her lawyer Anand Nalachan­dran said in court that she sac­ri­ficed her own well-be­ing for the fam­ily’s needs and was stretched to break­ing point. Be­fore the in­ci­dent, she had never hurt her son.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times last week, Mr Anand said: “Over the years, there have been many cases in­volv­ing psy­chi­atric con­di­tions with vary­ing back­grounds. This tragic case high­lighted the im­pact of care­giver stress.”</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal lawyer Amar­ick Gill said the “sad­dest case” he has worked on in a ca­reer span­ning 21 years in­volved a sin­gle mother who pushed her nine-year-old son out of a fifth-storey win­dow in 2013.</p>
    <p>Then 31, the mother was the pri­mary care­giver of the boy and had a his­tory of schizophre­nia while her son had med­i­cal con­di­tions that left him jaun­diced with brit­tle bones. She was sen­tenced to 10 years in prison for cul­pa­ble homi­cide.</p>
    <p>Mr Gill said: “If there had been ear­lier in­ter­ven­tion for her, and treat­ment for the schizophre­nia, she could have been taken into care and this tragedy could have been avoided.”</p>
    <p>He hopes an is­land­wide cen­sus can be drawn up to flag low-in­come fam­i­lies with his­tory of men­tal ill­nesses, and who may not have the means to be assessed and get help if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to his for­mer client, he said: “There are more fam­i­lies out there like hers. I hope peo­ple will start com­ing for­ward.”</p>
