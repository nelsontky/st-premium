    <p>Next-level home cook­ing</p>
    <p>To be sure, there are many who en­joy home-cooked meals every day. Not all of us are so lucky – or dili­gent.</p>
    <p>But dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when there was noth­ing to do but work and climb the walls in frus­tra­tion, some of us turned on our stoves and ovens to feed our­selves and our loved ones.</p>
    <p>For so long, it has been too easy to take the path of least re­sis­tance and tar pau or get food de­liv­ered. But with time on our hands, we de­cided to try our hand at cook­ing and bak­ing or just re-ac­quaint our­selves with long-for­got­ten skills.</p>
    <p>And the sort of cook­ing we did was not just for that dread­fully earnest idea of, roll eyes, nour­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>Out of kitchens came chick­ens brined and roasted. Cane­les made in cop­per moulds bought on a whim at E. De­hil­lerin in Paris years ago. Pasta us­ing those rollers lan­guish­ing too long in store rooms. From-scratch yong tau foo filled with fish paste, pork and dried sole fish. Soup brewed for hours in clay­pots. Beef Welling­ton, for Pete’s sake. Dum briyani. Achar. Nasi le­mak. Prawn noo­dles. Sour­dough loaves elab­o­rately scored be­fore bak­ing.</p>
    <p>Kids mar­velled at skills they never knew their par­ents had.</p>
    <p>I am very sure those home cooks sur­prised them­selves too.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic ig­nited a pas­sion I hope will burn bright and long.</p>
