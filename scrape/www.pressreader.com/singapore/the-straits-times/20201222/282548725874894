    <p>• Tot­ten­ham man­ager Jose Mour­inho be­lit­tled Le­ices­ter’s ster­ling dis­play in a 2-0 win over his side on Sun­day, three days af­ter claim­ing “the best team lost” in a 2-1 de­feat at Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t think ei­ther team played very, very well,” Mour­inho told the BBC af­ter Jamie Vardy’s penalty and Toby Alder­weireld’s own goal put his side to the sword.</p>
    <p>“It’s a game where your goal­keeper doesn’t make a sin­gle save, but it’s a game that we didn’t play very well.</p>
    <p>“We de­served to win the game at Liver­pool and that would have made it an amaz­ing week be­cause no­body has done that for a long time – the team was phe­nom­e­nal at Liver­pool. Now if you look at the ta­ble, ev­ery­body is there.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing picked up one point in their last three games, Spurs are now six points be­hind cham­pi­ons and lead­ers Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>But Mour­inho ar­gued the hosts missed the best chances on Sun­day, even though Le­ices­ter al­ways looked more dan­ger­ous in pos­ses­sion as their counter-at­tack­ing strat­egy paid div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>Claim­ing their sec­ond straight league de­feat was largely self-in­flicted – Le­ices­ter’s opener was the re­sult of a reck­less foul by Serge Aurier on Wes­ley Fo­fana in the box – Mour­inho added: “I would de­scribe it as a mis­take.</p>
    <p>“You have to know where you are, and know that you are in­side the box and the player is go­ing away from your goal with­out any kind of dan­ger.</p>
    <p>“Serge was phe­nom­e­nal against Liver­pool, prob­a­bly our best player but to­day, he made this mis­take. Did this mis­take cost us the three points? I think it is un­fair to say that.</p>
    <p>“If I have to talk about in­di­vid­u­als, I could go in other di­rec­tions where the at­ti­tude was not the at­ti­tude that I like.”</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers brushed off his op­po­site num­ber’s sour grapes, ex­press­ing his de­light af­ter his side bounced back from their 2-0 home de­feat by Ever­ton last Wed­nes­day to move up to sec­ond, four points be­hind Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>Like l ast sea­son when they ended fifth, the Foxes are firmly in the top-four hunt but this time, Rodgers is con­fi­dent they can sus­tain their chal­lenge af­ter fail­ing to qual­ify for the Cham­pi­ons League last sea­son.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers have done great. A Euro­pean cam­paign, lots of in­juries but they have kept the en­thu­si­asm, spirit and qual­ity, so it is a very pleas­ing open­ing third of the sea­son,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The am­bi­tion is to con­tinue im­prov­ing. We won’t get car­ried away, there is a lot of de­vel­op­ment to take place in our young play­ers.</p>
    <p>“We will see. It has been a re­ally good start, I am sat­is­fied with where we are at, know­ing there are im­prove­ments to make. The group is learn­ing all the time and that’s why we’re nowhere near the fin­ished prod­uct.”</p>
