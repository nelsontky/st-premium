    <p>A for­mer do­mes­tic worker was yes­ter­day cleared by the High Court of steal­ing more than $34,000 worth of items from Changi Air­port Group (CAG) chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Miss Parti Liyani, 46, who worked for the fam­ily from 2007 to 2016, had ap­pealed against her con­vic­tion and sen­tence of two years and two months’ jail.</p>
    <p>Her lawyer, Mr Anil Balchan­dani, who acted pro bono, ar­gued that the po­lice re­port was a pre­emp­tive move to stop her from</p>
    <p>lodg­ing a com­plaint against the Liews for il­le­gal de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Be­sides work­ing at Mr Liew’s Chancery Lane house, the In­done­sian was also told to clean the of­fice and home of his son Karl.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn al­lowed her ap­peal and over­turned her con­vic­tion on four theft charges.</p>
    <p>He found that there was an “im­proper mo­tive” on the part of Mr Liew and his son to pre­vent her from lodg­ing a com­plaint.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the judge said the de­fence’s al­le­ga­tion that there was</p>
    <p>col­lu­sion by all the mem­bers of the Liew fam­ily can­not stand.</p>
    <p>This was be­cause the de­fence had not cross-ex­am­ined all the wit­nesses on the al­leged col­lu­sion.</p>
    <p>The court heard that in Oc­to­ber 2016, the older Mr Liew, who was then over­seas, de­cided to sack Miss Parti.</p>
    <p>On Oct 28, 2016, Mr Karl Liew told Miss Parti that her em­ploy­ment was ter­mi­nated and gave her two hours to pack.</p>
    <p>While she was pack­ing items into three jumbo boxes, she ut</p>
    <p>tered a threat to lodge a com­plaint with the Man­power Min­istry.</p>
    <p>She re­turned to In­done­sia that day, af­ter ask­ing Mr Karl Liew to pay for the boxes to be shipped to her.</p>
    <p>The next day, the fam­ily opened the boxes, checked the con­tents and took a 21-se­cond video of the items that were taken out.</p>
    <p>They found items that al­legedly be­longed to mem­bers of the house­hold and a po­lice re­port was made</p>
    <p>RE­LIEF</p>
    <p>I’m so glad that I’m fi­nally free. I’ve been fight­ing for four years now and I have been strong all this while.’’</p>
    <p>MISS PARTI LIYANI</p>
    <p>on Oct 30, af­ter Mr Liew Mun Leong re­turned to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it was five weeks later, on Dec 3, that the po­lice at­tended to the scene. It was the day af­ter Miss Parti re­turned to Sin­ga­pore and she was ar­rested.</p>
    <p>In his 100-page judg­ment, Jus­tice Chan found there was a break in the chain of cus­tody of ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>This cre­ates a rea­son­able doubt as to whether some of the al­legedly stolen items dis­cov­ered by the fam­ily were ac­cu­rately doc­u­mented by the pho­to­graphs taken by the po­lice some five weeks later.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this pe­riod, the fam­ily were told by the po­lice that they were free to use the items.</p>
    <p>They took and put back items into the boxes but it is not clear if the items that were put back were the same ones re­moved ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan also found that two state­ments were taken from Miss Parti with­out an in­ter­preter.</p>
    <p>The judge also had se­ri­ous doubts about Mr Karl Liew’s cred­i­bil­ity, find­ing his tes­ti­mony to be “highly sus­pect”.</p>
    <p>Among other things, Mr Karl Liew claimed var­i­ous items of fe­male cloth­ing, al­legedly stolen by Miss Parti, be­longed to him and that he some­times wore women’s T-shirts.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan added that many of the al­legedly stolen items were old, dys­func­tional and low in value.</p>
    <p>This re­in­forced Miss Parti’s de­fence that she found these items in the trash. These in­cluded a dam­aged Gerald Genta watch, two old iPhones, a Prada bag with frayed edges and a pair of stained Gucci sun­glasses.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani told the court that he would be seek­ing com­pen­sa­tion for Miss Parti as she has not worked for the past four years.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the verdict, she sobbed and hugged her lawyer and staff from the mi­grant work­ers group, Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nomics (Home).</p>
    <p>Miss Parti has been stay­ing at Home’s shel­ter since 2016. She told re­porters: “I’m so glad that I’m fi­nally free. I’ve been fight­ing for four years now and I have been strong all this while.”</p>
