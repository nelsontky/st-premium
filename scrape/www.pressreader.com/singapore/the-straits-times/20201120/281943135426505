    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON A lit­tle-known agency that keeps the United States fed­eral bu­reau­cracy run­ning is the big­gest im­ped­i­ment to new ef­forts to fight the coro­n­avirus out­break, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“There’s a whole lot of things that we just don’t have avail­able to us,” Mr Bi­den said, in­clud­ing the distributi­on plan for Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Ms Emily Mur­phy, ad­min­is­tra­tor of the General Ser­vices Ad­min­is­tra­tion (GSA), must “as­cer­tain” the win­ner of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion be­tween Mr Bi­den and Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>That is a con­di­tion of re­leas­ing funds and re­sources to the win­ner, but she has so far not done so.</p>
    <p>De­spite a clear mar­gin of vic­tory for Mr Bi­den, Mr Trump has re­fused to con­cede, and his le­gal chal­lenges are fiz­zling. Ms Mur­phy has sole au­thor­ity to re­lease salaries, of­fice space and in­tel­li­gence brief­ings to an in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion, which takes over with Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>“Un­less it’s made avail­able soon, we’re going to be be­hind by weeks or months” in his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ef­forts to fight Covid-19, Mr Bi­den told emer­gency re­spon­ders, nurses and other front-line workers at an on­line event in Washington.</p>
    <p>“So, I just want to tell you that’s the only slow­down right now that we have.”</p>
    <p>A third wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion has gripped the US, and the coun­try’s death toll crossed 250,000 on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>New Jersey Gov­er­nor Phil Mur­phy de­scribed a “crazy sit­u­a­tion” where he speaks daily with the White House coro­n­avirus ex­perts and separately with Mr Bi­den’s ad­vi­sory board on the virus.</p>
    <p>“Those two camps aren’t speak­ing. And that’s a big prob­lem,” Mr Mur­phy, a Demo­crat, told CNN.</p>
    <p>“That is a ma­jor prob­lem that could put both the distributi­on of the vac­cine at risk and, more broadly, lives at risk.”</p>
    <p>Ms Mur­phy is un­der mount­ing pres­sure from elec­tion watch­dogs, Democrats, Repub­li­cans, the Amer­i­can Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion and her pre­de­ces­sor to recog­nise Mr Bi­den as the win­ner.</p>
    <p>“She’s going to make an as­cer­tain­ment when the win­ner is clear, as laid out in the Con­sti­tu­tion,” a GSA spokesman said be­fore Mr Bi­den’s re­marks.</p>
    <p>The bi­par­ti­san Na­tional Task Force on Elec­tion Crises said on Tues­day it was “past time” for the GSA ad­min­is­tra­tor to cer­tify Mr Bi­den. “This isn’t about pol­i­tics. It’s about hon­our­ing free and fair elec­tions. It’s also about lost lives.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump claims, with­out giv­ing ev­i­dence, that he was cheated out of a vic­tory by wide­spread fraud, and has fired off a flurry of law­suits that judges have mostly re­jected.</p>
    <p>An ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial said the White House was not pres­sur­ing Ms Mur­phy to with­hold recog­ni­tion of Mr Bi­den as the win­ner.</p>
    <p>Ms Mur­phy is re­ly­ing on prece­dent, her of­fice said, cit­ing the five-week de­lay af­ter the 2000 elec­tion be­fore Repub­li­can Ge­orge W. Bush was de­clared the win­ner.</p>
    <p>While the 2000 re­sult hung on 537 votes in just one state – Florida – Mr Trump would need to re­verse Mr Bi­den’s large mar­gins in three of four closely con­tested states, something elec­tion ex­perts and a grow­ing num­ber of Repub­li­cans say is vir­tu­ally im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The GSA did not say how or when the de­ci­sion would be made and has not re­sponded to a con­gres­sional let­ter ask­ing the same.</p>
    <p>Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion sources said it was rea­son­able to wait un­til vote re­counts are com­pleted and the le­gal chal­lenges re­solved.</p>
    <p>Mr Dave Bar­ram, who was GSA ad­min­is­tra­tor in 2000, said: “In 2000, there was no clear win­ner, and both (Al) Gore and Bush knew it. This is dif­fer­ent. It’s get­ting over­whelm­ingly ev­i­dent that Trump should con­cede.”</p>
