By leveraging technology, the medical team can efficientl­y monitor and interact with patients without unnecessar­y risk of exposure, said SGH.
The smartphone also contains pre-loaded games to help patients pass the time, as well as reading materials about Covid-19 and coping with isolation.
Each isolated patient, who needs to wear a mask at all times, will be given an admission pack containing surgical masks, a digital thermomete­r and toiletries, and a care pack filled with drinks and snacks.
