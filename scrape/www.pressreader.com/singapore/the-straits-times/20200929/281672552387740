    <p>NEW YORK Coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates have in­creased at “an alarm­ing rate” in sev­eral New York neigh­bour­hoods, par­tic­u­larly among the Ortho­dox Jewish com­mu­nity in Brook­lyn, city health au­thor­i­ties warned on Sun­day, threat­en­ing to sanc­tion cer­tain schools if they fail to com­ply with anti-virus reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Al­though t he Big Ap­ple has touted that it kept its in­fec­tion rate un­der 1 per cent for more than a month, six neigh­bour­hoods i n Brook­lyn and two in Queens have seen their rates spike, sur­pass­ing 5 to 6 per cent in Mid­wood and Gravesend. The in­crease co­in­cides with the Jewish High Hol­i­days, the most holy days in the Jewish cal­en­dar, that cul­mi­nated yes­ter­day with Yom Kip­pur.</p>
    <p>“These ar­eas ac­count for over 23 per cent of new cases city­wide... de­spite rep­re­sent­ing just un­der 7 per cent of the city’s over­all pop­u­la­tion,” New York city health ser­vices said, adding that the data showed an in­crease in hos­pi­talised pa­tients in two Brook­lyn hos­pi­tals, and at least one hos­pi­tal in Queens.</p>
    <p>The in­crease has raised fears of a sec­ond wave in New York, which re­ported a record 23,800 Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties when the epi­demic peaked in the spring.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the health au­thor­i­ties or­gan­ised a press con­fer­ence in one of the most af­fected Brook­lyn neigh­bour­hoods, Bor­ough Park.</p>
    <p>“This may be the most pre­car­i­ous po­si­tion with Covid-19 we have ex­pe­ri­enced in months,” said health com­mis­sioner Dave Chok­shi, urg­ing peo­ple to wear face masks and re­spect so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But he and his col­leagues were booed by at least two peo­ple in the crowd, in­clud­ing Ortho­dox Jewish ra­dio host Heshy Tischler who is known for his anti-mask stance, video from NBC showed.</p>
    <p>“There are peo­ple who refuse to be­lieve the truth, this is a deadly virus and we have easy ways to avoid it,” Dr Mitchell Katz, the chief of New York’s mu­nic­i­pal health­care sys­tem, told the news sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties an­nounced a se­ries of ed­u­ca­tional ac­tiv­i­ties for neigh­bour­hood res­i­dents in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>With the re­open­ing of public schools sched­uled for Thurs­day, the au­thor­i­ties also warned they would con­duct in­spec­tions in non­pub­lic schools – in­clud­ing many yeshivas, or re­li­gion-fo­cused Jewish schools – and would close fa­cil­i­ties and im­pose fines if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>But the restart of in-per­son learn­ing has been a touchy sub­ject and has al­ready been post­poned twice, as more par­ents of New York’s some 1.1 mil­lion public school stu­dents opt in­stead for re­mote classes.</p>
    <p>The Coun­cil of School Su­per­vi­sors and Ad­min­is­tra­tors (CSA) has called for man­age­ment of the school sys­tem – tra­di­tion­ally the mayor’s re­spon­si­bil­ity in the US – to be trans­ferred to the New York state ed­u­ca­tional ser­vices dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>New York Mayor Bill de Bla­sio re­cently promised to hire some 4,500 ad­di­tional teach­ers to fa­cil­i­tate both in-per­son and on­line learn­ing.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to the CSA, a union that claims to rep­re­sent about 6,400 of­fi­cials for the city’s 1,800 public schools, he and Schools Chan­cel­lor Richard Car­ranza failed to hire enough teach­ers.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear whether schools will re­open on Thurs­day as planned. Mr de Bla­sio and the State Depart­ment of Ed­u­ca­tion have not re­sponded to the CSA’s state­ment.</p>
    <p>The United States re­ported at least 267 new coro­n­avirus deaths and 37,332 new cases on Sun­day, ac­cord­ing to a New York Times data­base. Over the past week, there was an av­er­age of 43,111 daily cases, a 23 per cent in­crease from a fort­night ago. The coun­try has recorded more than 7.1 mil­lion Covid-19 in­fec­tions and over 204,000 deaths in all.</p>

        <p data-role="text">With public schools, like this one in New York&#x2019;s Man&#xAD;hat&#xAD;tan bor&#xAD;ough, set to re&#xAD;open on Thurs&#xAD;day, the au&#xAD;thor&#xAD;i&#xAD;ties warned they would con&#xAD;duct in&#xAD;spec&#xAD;tions in non-public schools as well, in&#xAD;clud&#xAD;ing Jewish schools, as in&#xAD;fec&#xAD;tion rates have spiked among the Ortho&#xAD;dox Jewish com&#xAD;mu&#xAD;nity.</p>
