    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON The in­ter­na­tional break is over, the Pre­mier League is back, and so are the mind games when it in­volves a big clash be­tween two high-pro­file man­agers.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham man­ager Jose Mour­inho sug­gested yes­ter­day Manch­ester City put pres­sure on Eng­land boss Gareth South­gate to re­lease Ra­heem Ster­ling from in­ter­na­tional duty this week so that the for­ward could pre­pare for today’s Pre­mier League clash in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Ster­ling and Liver­pool’s Jordan Hen­der­son missed Eng­land’s Na­tions League dead rub­ber with Ice­land on Wed­nes­day, with South­gate say­ing both suf­fered in­juries.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho, how­ever, had none of it. He said at his pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day: “I have read that Gareth South­gate has said some foot­ball club man­agers put pres­sure on their play­ers not to play for the na­tional team.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of that, some­times Gareth feels the needs to call some of the club man­agers to cool down the emo­tions. I would like him to say which are the coaches that put pres­sure on their play­ers, and which are the coaches he calls.</p>
    <p>“We all know Ra­heem Ster­ling is go­ing to play to­mor­row. When Eric Dier left the na­tional team in­jured in the pre­vi­ous month, he didn’t play two matches for Tot­ten­ham. He needed a cou­ple of weeks to re­cover but I know Ra­heem is go­ing to play to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“These are the lit­tle de­tails I think Gareth should ex­plain to us all.”</p>
    <p>His side’s ti­tle cre­den­tials face a thor­ough test when they host Pep Guardi­ola’s City today, and he would also pre­fer to have well­rested play­ers.</p>
    <p>Spurs are just a point be­hind lead­ers Le­ices­ter (18) and are un­beaten in seven league games, rais­ing hope they could win the ti­tle for the first time in 60 years.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho, how­ever, also played down the sig­nif­i­cance of today’s big clash.</p>
    <p>“The re­sult of the game will not change any­thing, only three points more or less,” said the Por­tuguese on the day of one-year an­niver­sary at Tot­ten­ham.</p>
    <p>He con­firmed that Matt Do­herty is out due to coro­n­avirus, while Erik Lamela is in the fi­nal stages of re­cov­ery fol­low­ing a foot in­jury.</p>
    <p>While Spurs are soar­ing, City are lan­guish­ing in 10th, six points off the top but with a game in hand.</p>
    <p>A re­turn of just 12 points from their open­ing seven games is by far their low­est since Guardi­ola ar</p>
    <p>rived in Manch­ester five years ago.</p>
    <p>Yet, af­ter a dif­fi­cult start caused by the lack of a pre-sea­son, in­juries and Covid cases, the trip today will also be an in­di­ca­tor as to whether City have turned the corner.</p>
    <p>They are un­beaten in nine games in all com­pe­ti­tions, but have strug­gled for goals, scor­ing just once in each of their last five league games.</p>
    <p>But Guardi­ola, who penned a two-year con­tract ex­ten­sion on Thurs­day, could have both strik</p>
    <p>ers, Gabriel Je­sus and Ser­gio Aguero, to choose from for the first time this sea­son.</p>
    <p>At his pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the ques­tions were mostly about his new deal.</p>
    <p>The City boss said: “I spoke a lot with di­rec­tor of foot­ball Txiki (Be­giris­tain), (chair­man) Khal­doon Al Mubarak and an­a­lyse what we can do. They are the rea­son I am here. They gave me a lot.</p>
    <p>“But I’m not think­ing much right</p>
    <p>now about ti­tles. We are think­ing week by week to do a good job.”</p>
    <p>He added that Fer­nand­inho is un­fit today as he has “some­thing in his stom­ach”, while Nathan Ake will be out af­ter in­jur­ing his ham­string on in­ter­na­tional duty with the Nether­lands.</p>
