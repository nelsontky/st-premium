    <p>Novena Global Health­care Group co-founders Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh have agreed to legally sep­a­rate all their business in­ter­ests as the scan­dal dog­ging them and their web of com­pa­nies in­ten­si­fied. The lat­est twist in­volves the Sin­ga­pore po­lice open­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into their Cay­man Is­lands hold­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>Novena Global Health­care Group co-founders Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh have agreed to legally sep­a­rate all their business in­ter­ests as the scan­dal dog­ging them and their web of com­pa­nies in­ten­si­fied.</p>
    <p>The lat­est twist in­volves the Sin­ga­pore po­lice open­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the Cay­man Is­lands hold­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported last month that ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young (EY) had lodged a po­lice report re­gard­ing al­legedly unau­tho­rised au­dit sig­na­tures on some of Novena Global Health­care’s fi­nan­cial state­ments. EY said it did not sign off on the fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh said yes­ter­day that a “sep­a­ra­tion agree­ment” was entered into be­tween the cousins and for­mer business part­ners on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Nel­son Loh, whose where­abouts are un­known, did not is­sue a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment in­volves Mr Ter­ence Loh trans­fer­ring all his shares in Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group to Mr Nel­son Loh for $1 and re­sign­ing as its di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Nel­son Loh will trans­fer all his shares in three cor­po­rate en­ti­ties – Novena Global Health­care and all its sub­sidiaries, Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered Dorr Global Health­care In­ter­na­tional and Sin­ga­pore- reg­is­tered Rock Star Ad­vi­sors – to Mr Ter­ence Loh for $1. He will also re­sign as di­rec­tor of the three en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>“This is a mu­tu­ally agreed and legally bind­ing doc­u­ment which clearly sep­a­rates the business in­ter­ests that Nel­son and I have been in­volved in since 2008,” said</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh. “We have gone through many chal­lenges to­gether and the time has come now for each of us to chart our sep­a­rate ca­reers and pur­suits.”</p>
    <p>The Lohs will com­plete the share trans­fers and res­ig­na­tions of di­rec­tor­ships by Nov 5. Mr Ter­ence Loh said in his state­ment that the sep­a­ra­tion agree­ment “pro­vides clar­ity for me to re­solve le­gal and cor­po­rate is­sues of the busi­nesses trans­ferred to me”.</p>
    <p>“In re­la­tion to the al­leged forgery of the ac­counts of Novena Global Health­care, I un­equiv­o­cally state that I was not in­volved in the forgery. I have re­mained in Sin­ga­pore and con­tinue to be avail­able to as­sist the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment.”</p>
    <p>BN Group is­sued a state­ment early yes­ter­day morn­ing say­ing that it “un­der­stands that Mr Ter­ence Loh is try­ing to solve prob­lems (aris­ing) from Novena Global Health­care’s in­ci­dent, so we had mu­tu­ally agreed that (he) should re­sign from BN Group”.</p>
    <p>“BN group has never con­sol­i­dated, or is by any chance, linked to Novena Global Health­care and its forged fi­nan­cial state­ments,” it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh coun­tered: “The role that oth­ers have played in the cur­rent dif­fi­cul­ties will be­come, in due course, clear.”</p>
    <p>BN Group chair­man Evan­ge­line Shen and the Loh co-founders made head­lines in Au­gust on their re­ported £280 mil­lion (S$491 mil­lion) takeover bid for English Premier League club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>But the am­bi­tious bid soured quickly af­ter doc­tored pho­to­graphs fea­tur­ing them and for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama as well as inconsiste­ncies in pub­lic­ity ma­te­ri­als sur­faced.</p>
    <p>Me­dia re­ports ear­lier this month cited Ms Shen claim­ing that BN Group was still pur­su­ing a takeover of New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>“Nel­son ac­knowl­edges that... (Ter­ence Loh’s) views and ap</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported last month that ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young (EY) had lodged a po­lice report re­gard­ing al­legedly unau­tho­rised au­dit sig­na­tures on some of Novena Global</p>

    <p>proval as a di­rec­tor of BN Group were not sought prior to” Ms Shen’s com­ments on the con­tin­ued bid, Mr Ter­ence Loh said.</p>
    <p>Mr Nel­son Loh also “ac­knowl­edges that he re­mains li­able on all guar­an­tees that he ex­e­cuted de­spite the sep­a­ra­tion of in­ter­ests” as set out in the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Other firms linked to the Lohs have also come un­der scru­tiny, in­clud­ing Ax­ing­ton, a Catal­ist-listed com­pany owned by the Lohs.</p>
    <p>The photo scan­dal and other dis­clo­sures have prompted the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s reg­u­la­tory arm to call for an as­sess­ment of Ax­ing­ton’s di­rec­tors for their “ex­pe­ri­ence, ex­per­tise, char­ac­ter and in­tegrity”.</p>
    <p>This sparked a slew of board mem­ber res­ig­na­tions, start­ing with in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor and for­mer US am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar.</p>
    <p>Mat­ters were com­pounded when a deal that was meant to kick off Ax­ing­ton’s move to change its core business and ex­pand into the med­i­cal and con­sumer well­ness sec­tor fell through. This came af­ter share­hold­ers nixed its pro­posed buy­out of Malaysia-based med­i­cal prod­ucts dis­trib­u­tor Vesta Apex Trad­ing, the com­pany said on Oct 2.</p>
