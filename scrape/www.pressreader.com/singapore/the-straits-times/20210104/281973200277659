    <p>The value of some things that we keep in­creases with time, and so it is with friends. I found one such trea­sure in 1995, in an­other bus en­thu­si­ast (Meet Sin­ga­pore’s bus en­thu­si­asts, Dec 12, 2020), a friend­ship made pos­si­ble by the un­likely re­sponse of an ed­i­tor.</p>
    <p>As a child in the 1960s, I was smit­ten with buses, es­pe­cially bus tick­ets; I’d pick them off vis­it­ing rel­a­tives and friends, and shame­lessly from floor­boards, dust­bins and the back of bus seats.</p>
    <p>I would also note down all the bus com­pa­nies – there were al­most a dozen back then – and their routes.</p>
    <p>As a teen, I thumbed through the pages of The Land Trans­port Of Sin­ga­pore, one of the ear­li­est pictorial books with a chap­ter on buses.</p>
    <p>On a whim, I wrote to the pub­lisher (Ed­u­ca­tional Pub­li­ca­tions Bureau, now de­funct), won­der­ing if it could fur­nish me with the ad­dress of a cer­tain F. W. York, who seemed to have con­trib­uted many bus pho­tos.</p>
    <p>A few weeks later, to my sur­prise, thanks to who­ever made the call, I had in my hands a home ad­dress in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Sur­prise No. 2: I got a re­ply from Mr Fred­er­ick W. York when I wrote to him.</p>
    <p>We be­came what was then called “pen-pals”, a term rarely heard these days.</p>
    <p>Our let­ters were hand­writ­ten – mine a scrawl and his a work of art, let­ters exquisitel­y formed by a foun­tain pen.</p>
    <p>Fred was gen­er­ous, for he would al­ways en­close a packet of bus pho­tos from Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia or Bri­tain; an ar­ti­cle he had writ­ten or come across; or some other bus para­pher­na­lia.</p>
    <p>More than any­thing, I en­joyed read­ing his English. How could some­thing so mun­dane like buses inspire such writ­ing, one might won­der? Pas­sion.</p>
    <p>Even my fam­ily would ex­cit­edly watch over my shoul­ders as I cut open the thick, brown en­velopes with a row of stamps. As for me, I would re­cip­ro­cate with ar­ti­cles from The Straits Times and some pho­tos.</p>
    <p>On one oc­ca­sion, when I was</p>
    <p>not sure of the livery of the old bus com­pa­nies, he went to the trou­ble of in­di­cat­ing on a paint cat­a­logue which com­pany car­ried what livery.</p>
    <p>Once, I lamented how I was made to throw away my vast bus ticket col­lec­tion as we kept mov­ing from one Hous­ing Board new town to an­other. He con­soled me, and sent me sev­eral bus tick­ets in the next mail packet. He was of a giv­ing spirit.</p>
    <p>Over the years, we shared more than bus-re­lated news. We be­came good friends, de­spite the dis­tance and the age dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>A cou­ple of years ago, his work of art – his let­ters – be­came one of painful labour.</p>
    <p>His eye­sight was leav­ing him, and his health was de­te­ri­o­rat­ing. The last let­ter from Fred was five pages long, writ­ten over three days.</p>
    <p>A for­mal type­writ­ten let­ter ar­rived in Au­gust 2019, from one of his sons, an­nounc­ing the death of Fred.</p>
    <p>While our cor­re­spon­dence spanned more than two decades, I met him only twice, once in Bri­tain and once when he vis­ited Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>We spoke only a few times over the phone, and we never ex­changed e-mail ad­dresses. The act of writ­ing on pa­per, with lit­tle chance of edit­ing, makes you a care­ful, pen­sive and sin­cere writer. I will miss that with Fred.</p>
    <p>As we start the new year, I would like to share what Fred has taught me.</p>
    <p>Be pas­sion­ate: Col­lect and doc­u­ment our his­tory (don’t throw away “stuff” be­cause your mother asked you to!).</p>
    <p>Be gen­er­ous and share your col­lec­tion and mem­o­ries with the com­mu­nity and na­tion.</p>
    <p>If Fred had not done so, to­day, the his­tory of our land trans­port would be that much poorer.</p>
    <p>Thank you Fred, for the love you had for buses and your fel­low en­thu­si­asts.</p>
