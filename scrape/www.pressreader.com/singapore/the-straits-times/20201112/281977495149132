    <p>The state of elec­tric-ve­hi­cle (EV) adop­tion in Sin­ga­pore has been lam­en­ta­ble. Out of about 515,000 pri­vate ve­hi­cles, only 0.2 per cent of them are EVs.</p>
    <p>Last year, Tesla’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Elon Musk openly crit­i­cised Sin­ga­pore for not sup­port­ing elec­tric ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>And in Nis­san’s lat­est Kicks e-Power launch of its ur­ban crossover, it de­scribed Sin­ga­pore as a “de­vel­op­ing EV mar­ket”, and quite rightly so.</p>
    <p>Yet, this year, amid the un­prece­dented cir­cum­stances, has turned out to be a wa­ter­shed mo­ment for EV adop­tion in Sin­ga­pore – on three lev­els.</p>
    <p>At the pol­icy level, Bud­get 2020 sets Sin­ga­pore on course for a so­ci­ety in which all ve­hi­cles run on cleaner en­ergy by 2040, be it hy­brid ve­hi­cles or EVs.</p>
    <p>The poli­cies laid out in­clude:</p>
    <p>The expansion of EV charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture from 1,600 to 28,000 points by 2030 An early adop­tion in­cen­tive scheme of­fer­ing a 45 per cent re­bate on the Ad­di­tional Reg­is­tra­tion Fees, capped at $20,000.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cially, ex­ten­sive col­lab­o­ra­tions with au­to­mo­bile man­u­fac­tur­ers have ma­te­ri­alised.</p>
    <p>Hyundai re­cently be­gan con­struct­ing its first au­to­mated EV factory in the Jurong Innovation District, while Tesla has posted job ad­ver­tise­ments for po­si­tions in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Not­with­stand­ing the can­cel­la­tion of Dyson’s EV project, th­ese in­di­cate a marked change in our drive to ac­tively adopt EVs.</p>
    <p>At the in­di­vid­ual level, BlueSG, Sin­ga­pore’s shared EV plat­form, reached its one-mil­lionth rental since its launch in 2017 – evinc­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans’ grow­ing com­fort with EVs.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, there is more we can achieve – in the mean­time and in the next 20 years.</p>
    <p>Even though the 2040 vi­sion does ex­tend to public trans­port, the elec­tri­fi­ca­tion of buses and taxis must move faster.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a small ur­banised na­tion, with a trans­port sys­tem sup­ported by the public sec­tor. This cre­ates a prime en­vi­ron­ment to in­tro­duce EVs and hy­brid ve­hi­cles as part of a na­tion­wide drive, sim­i­lar to what Shen­zhen has done. Such a move­ment can breed habits and trans­late into pos­i­tive change in con­sumer be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Stake­hold­ers should also take steps to in­cor­po­rate EV-friendly plans into ev­ery com­mer­cial and res­i­den­tial ar­range­ment – that is, carparks for new build-to-or­der flats, shop­ping cen­tres, com­mer­cial build­ings and petrol sta­tions. This must be a sym­bi­otic as­so­ci­a­tion be­tween the gov­ern­ment agen­cies and other public/pri­vate stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing all ve­hi­cles run on cleaner en­ergy by 2040 is am­bi­tious. How­ever, this am­bi­tion can be­come re­al­ity – if we are aware of our du­ties as global cit­i­zens and con­scious green con­sumers. Che­ung Chun Man</p>
