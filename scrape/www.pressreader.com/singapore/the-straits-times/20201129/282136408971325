    <p>As I write, rush­ing to meet a dead­line be­fore dash­ing to the air­port, I am re­luc­tant though ready to tackle this up­com­ing jour­ney.</p>
    <p>De­spite ap­pre­hen­sion and fears, my need to be with my age­ing par­ents in the United States over­rides my de­sire to re­main safely here in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In life, to be able to do only what we want ver­sus what we need might well be the ul­ti­mate goal.</p>
    <p>When my mother re­tired from her ca­reer as chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer at Lewis Ad­ver­tis­ing, she loved telling peo­ple: “From now on, I shall only do what I want to do, not what I have to do.”</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, I have put on a dress for a friend’s party, when I would have pre­ferred to stay home, and when I worked in New York, I of­ten stayed late at the of­fice not only to get more done, but also to im­press my boss.</p>
    <p>In both cases, I acted in the way I thought would sat­isfy the de­sires of im­por­tant peo­ple in my life.</p>
    <p>Now, dur­ing this world­wide health pan­demic, count­less friends, in real life and on so­cial me­dia, are lament­ing about how they have a “need to travel”.</p>
    <p>Blinded by de­sire, we are per­haps be­ing tone-deaf as we con­sider our wishes to be ne­ces­si­ties, while many oth­ers lose their jobs and pon­der how to cover ba­sic ex­penses for their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Ob­vi­ously, food, water, shel­ter and cloth­ing are re­quire­ments, but that ex­pen­sive meal or pair of trendy sneak­ers is not needed for sur­vival, even if many of us have con­vinced our­selves oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>When we learn to pri­ori­tise our needs over our wants, then we dis­play ma­tu­rity. We as­sume adults are ca­pa­ble of cut­ting through the noise and de­ci­pher­ing our myr­iad of choices, since we act as role mod­els, teach­ing our chil­dren and youth how to man­age their money, mind­sets and lives.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, age usu­ally brings wis­dom, and at 52, I value ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the mean­ing­ful ver­sus tick­ing the boxes of the mul­ti­tudes of minu­tiae of ev­ery­day life.</p>
    <p>To quote the fa­mil­iar lyrics from The Rolling Stones, we can’t al­ways get what we want. But here I of­fer that if we just pause to ap­pre­ci­ate life’s bless­ings, we might find we get ex­actly what we need.</p>
    <p>This does mean dis­ap­point­ing peo­ple at times. If I say no to a friend, or refuse to con­form to norms, I am not try­ing to be rude or dif­fi­cult. In­stead, I am re­main­ing au­then­tic.</p>
    <p>When I was in my 20s and 30s, I con­stantly put pres­sure on my­self, try­ing to meet other peo­ple’s ex­pec­ta­tions, pla­cat­ing them, ful­fill­ing their wishes and wants. As a per­fec­tion­ist, I aimed to im­prove and do more than phys­i­cally pos­si­ble. Not un­til I was in my mid-40s did I fully ap­pre­ci­ate that I may be only the best ver­sion of my­self. Real friends and even em­ploy­ers ac­cept this, not de­mand­ing or ex­pect­ing more.</p>
    <p>Our re­cent en­forced stints at home have of­fered time and per­spec­tive to con­tem­plate why many of our needs are, in­deed, re­ally de­sires. How ap­pro­pri­ate to find our­selves wit­ness­ing a grow­ing push for sus­tain­able liv­ing, which has many ask­ing, “Do I re­ally need this?”</p>
    <p>We all, I imag­ine, have bought less stuff this year, be­cause we are more mind­ful, and the econ­omy is dire, if not for us, then for our neigh­bours and friends.</p>
    <p>We may find con­so­la­tion in this mind­set shift, know­ing our with­drawal from con­sump­tion is good for the planet, our bank ac­counts and even our men­tal health.</p>
    <p>Over the past nine months, I have grown com­fort­able in this new pat­tern. I am grate­ful for the safety we en­joy in Sin­ga­pore, and no one will find me board­ing a flight or cruise to nowhere, not even on a boon­dog­gle week­end to Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Alas, I now need to travel to the US. Do not get me wrong – if not for the deadly pan­demic that has killed more than a mil­lion peo­ple glob­ally, in­fected mil­lions more and wrecked busi­nesses and liveli­hoods – with the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund es­ti­mat­ing US$28 tril­lion (S$37 tril­lion) in lost out­put – I would be yearn­ing to jour­ney out into the world.</p>
    <p>Yet, the fear of in­fec­tion, and the re­al­ity of hav­ing to serve a 14-day Stay-Home No­tice (SHN) at a ho­tel when I re­turn, has taken any thrill out of the equa­tion.</p>
    <p>In­deed, my par­ents fuel my need to travel, plain and sim­ple. Mother, 78, re­cently had hip-re­place­ment surgery. Anx­ious to find out the med­i­cal de­tails, I e-mailed and called the doc­tor mul­ti­ple times, but he did not re­spond, per­haps over­whelmed by the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, my mother had back surgery, and my fa­ther turns 82 next week. Since I have not seen them in over a year, I need to go, even though my de­sire is to re­main here, in safety.</p>
    <p>Al­though I love my par­ents dearly, the prospect of spend­ing 26 hours to cover 15,855km while vis­it­ing three air­ports to reach my lit­tle home­town in North Carolina, where my par­ents still live, is daunt­ing.</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, I will take on the chal­lenge and travel to the US, along with my daugh­ter Bee, 12.</p>
    <p>De­spite the threats of the global pan­demic, I be­lieve she too needs to make this pas­sage dur­ing her school hol­i­day, what with her grand­par­ents’ ad­vanc­ing age.</p>
    <p>So, we shall take the risk in ex­change for the re­ward of spend­ing time with my par­ents, fully aware that SHN and a Covid-19 test await us upon our re­turn to Sin­ga­pore. I want and need to do the right thing, for this is my duty, as the only child of par­ents who never imag­ined I would forge my path on the other side of the world.</p>
    <p>If noth­ing else, this pan­demic is a stark re­minder of how I must man­age my de­sires for the less es­sen­tial things, while be­ing grate­ful for hav­ing my gen­uine needs – and those of my fam­ily, friends, and com­mu­nity – met, es­pe­cially when too many around the world are not so for­tu­nate.</p>
    <p>Al­though I love my par­ents dearly, the prospect of spend­ing 26 hours to cover 15,855km while vis­it­ing three air­ports to reach my lit­tle home­town in North Carolina, where my par­ents still live, is daunt­ing. Be that as it may, I will take on the chal­lenge and travel to the US, along with my daugh­ter Bee, 12.</p>
