    <p>NEW YORK • The life of a Wall Street trader was once one of busi­ness trips and work din­ners, but now it is any­thing but.</p>
    <p>The cul­prit, as with so many of the eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial dis­rup­tions the United States has faced over the past months, is the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has ren­dered life for the bro­kers, bankers and busi­ness peo­ple fuelling the world’s largest econ­omy much more lonely.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple work­ing on high-priced trans­ac­tions like ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings, bond deals or merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions “used to travel a lot to meet clients”, who would typ­i­cally sign agree­ments only in per­son, re­called Mr Karl Hael­ing of LBBW bank.</p>
    <p>“Now they would very hap­pily give the man­date with­out see­ing you,” he added.</p>
    <p>Wall Street sits in the heart of New York City, an early epi­cen­tre as the Covid-19 out­break in the US turned into the world’s worst, with more than 224,000 deaths and eight mil­lion cases na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic’s in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion in March tem­po­rar­ily cleared the mar­ket mak­ers from the New York Stock Ex­change’s bois­ter­ous floor and forced traders across Wall Street to re­treat in­doors, re­ly­ing on their phones, e-mail and in­stant mes­sag­ing sys­tems to talk with clients.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are do­ing brain­storm­ing on these var­i­ous video plat­forms and they are com­ing up with prod­uct ideas re­motely,” said Mr Daniel Alpert, found­ing manag­ing part­ner at in­vest­ment bank West­wood Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>But that has not held in­dices back. The Nas­daq and S&P 500 have both re­cov­ered from their mas­sive plunges in March, while the Dow has also re­gained most of its strength, though mil­lions re­main job­less and un­em­ploy­ment is at a high 7.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>TRICK­LING BACK</p>
    <p>Aided by a se­cure In­ter­net con­nec­tion, Mr Hael­ing holds 30-minute meet­ings twice per day to keep up with col­leagues about the mar­kets, pol­i­tics and the om­nipresent coro­n­avirus threat, a work-from-home rou­tine he said suits him fine.</p>
    <p>“I went back (to the of­fice) for three days in the sum­mer be­cause of a storm which cut the power at home, and I re­alised how in­ef­fi­cient it is be­cause I spent three hours on the train,” he said.</p>
    <p>But even with the virus still a threat across the US, traders are slowly trick­ling back to Wall Street.</p>
    <p>The New York City Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion es­ti­mates there are 460,000 peo­ple em­ployed by the fi­nan­cial sec­tor in the city, and their work is con­sid­ered an es­sen­tial ser­vice un­der state law.</p>
    <p>The New York Stock Ex­change re­opened in May with traders don­ning masks and sep­a­rated by plex­i­glass, while Mr Alpert started work­ing from his of­fice again at the end of June.</p>
    <p>But rather than the 15 or so peo­ple who usu­ally show up in his of­fice, it is just him and oc­ca­sion­ally an­other part­ner.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, he at­tended his first in-per­son busi­ness lunch since the coro­n­avirus’ ar­rival, “out­side, of course”, and closed a re­cent deal with around eight peo­ple in the same room.</p>
    <p>“There are just some times when you re­ally do need the high-speed in­ter­ac­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>BNP Paribas, which had a few cases of em­ploy­ees test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus or sus­pect­ing they had it, has let about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of its staff re­turn.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors are banned in the of­fice, but in a tour given to an Agence France-Presse jour­nal­ist over live video, traders could be seen scat­tered over a long line of desks and sep­a­rated by plex­i­glass, with floor mark­ings en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to so­cially dis­tance.</p>
    <p>“Any­thing is on the ta­ble to give our em­ploy­ees flex­i­bil­ity,” said Mr Kevin Abraszek, the bank’s head of hu­man re­sources change and trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>FOR­EVER CHANGED?</p>
    <p>Staff at other banks have re­turned as well. JPMor­gan Chase asked all its heads of bro­ker­age and sales di­vi­sions, who were still tele­work­ing, to re­turn to the of­fice by the mid­dle of last month, with ex­cep­tions for med­i­cal con­di­tions or child­care needs.</p>
    <p>But only about 20 per cent of its staff show up, and who re­ports to the of­fice of­ten dif­fers by the day.</p>
    <p>At in­vest­ment bank Gold­man Sachs, about 30 per cent of staff are in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Out­side Lower Man­hat­tan’s sky­scrapers, there is no doubt the neigh­bour­hoods are not back to their for­mer selves.</p>
    <p>Traders in their uni­forms of sleeve­less fleece vests no longer flock to Wall Street each morn­ing, and in­dus­try of­fi­cials ac­knowl­edge it may take a while longer be­fore nor­malcy re­turns.</p>
    <p>“We are try­ing to in­stil a longert­erm new... work­ing cul­ture in which work­ing from home will re­main part of what we do,” Mr Abraszek said. “It is just a ques­tion of how much that will be.”</p>
