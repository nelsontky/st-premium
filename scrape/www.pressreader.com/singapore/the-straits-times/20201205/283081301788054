    <p>You would not ex­pect a new player like Mutt Mo­tor­cy­cles to make waves in the local mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But the Birm­ing­ham-based brand is do­ing ex­actly that just months af­ter en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore be­fore a pan­demic-in­duced slow­down.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary to Oc­to­ber this year, it sold 33 of its retro-look­ing mo­tor­cy­cles to beat mass-mar­ket brands such as Kawasaki, Kymco and Dae­lim.</p>
    <p>Per­haps one thing Mutt has got right is its pric­ing. The 250cc Fat Sab­bath re­viewed here has an on-the-road price tag of $18,500.</p>
    <p>That in­cludes COE, a two-year war­ranty on parts and labour, one year re­cov­ery ser­vice, a cus­tom ERP in-ve­hi­cle unit bracket, a full tank of petrol and a CashCard with $20 stored value.</p>
    <p>But there is more to the bike than a wal­let-friendly price tag. Own­ing a Mutt mo­tor­cy­cle is like get­ting a mem­ber­ship into a low-key cool club.</p>
    <p>The Fat Sab­bath, which is also avail­able in a 125cc ver­sion, drips X-fac­tor.</p>
    <p>Like the rest of the Mutt line-up, it oozes 1970s retro charm, com­plete with rub­ber garter fork seal pro­tec­tors, stitched brown leather seats, ca­ble-ac­tu­ated speedome­ters and gold­flake­coloured fuel tanks.</p>
    <p>The matte-black test bike comes with knob­bly tyres.</p>
    <p>Aside from ap­peal­ing to hip­sters, Mutt mo­tor­cy­cles will also get the thumbs-up from cus­tom builders who “chop up” in­ex­pen­sive mo­tor­cy­cles like the Suzuki Van Van or Yamaha TW200 to make unique works of art.</p>
    <p>But it is against the law to ride mod­i­fied mo­tor­cy­cles here. This is where the road-le­gal Mutt will gain law-abid­ing fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>The sin­gle-cylin­der, five-speed Fat Sab­bath l ooks ev­ery bit a cus­tom mo­tor­bike. Its front and tail fend­ers are short. Its LED brake and sig­nal lights look like they come from af­ter­mar­ket ac­ces­sory shops.</p>
    <p>Bil­let alu­minium brack­ets sup­port its round head­lamp. A bash plate sug­gests the fuel-in­jected Fat Sab­bath can be taken off the beaten track.</p>
    <p>Rid­ing it trans­ports older riders like me back to when I be­gan rid­ing a mo­tor­cy­cle. Its bul­let­proof and low-main­te­nance Suzuki en­gine barks a fa­mil­iar tune, rem­i­nis­cent of a time when mo­tor­cy­cles were sim­ple and raw.</p>
    <p>I found my­self smil­ing af­ter mud pud­dles left a dis­tinct mud spray on the back of my jacket.</p>
    <p>Un­like taller dirt bikes of the 1970s and 1980s, the Fat Sab­bath, which has a dry weight of 130kg, al­lows both your feet to rest firmly on the tar­mac.</p>
    <p>Its per­for­mance fig­ures, how­ever, are hum­ble – given that it has only 21bhp and 18Nm of torque. Even so, its en­gine ex­cels in the low and mid­dle rev ranges. The bike is punchi­est be­tween 4,000rpm and 8,000rpm.</p>
    <p>While it is ca­pa­ble of tak­ing you to hard-to-ac­cess spots, it is, in re­al­ity, more suited to city rid­ing.</p>
    <p>With a rear sprocket smaller than those on race-ready dirt bikes, the Fat Sab­bath will not vi­brate vi­o­lently or strain its en­gine while trav­el­ling on the ex­press­way. Its speed tops out at about 120kmh.</p>
    <p>Still, it takes a lit­tle ef­fort when cor­ner­ing as its steer­ing feels heavy.</p>
    <p>Its non-ad­justable sus­pen­sion lacks damp­ing for rough ter­rain, but will do just fine for road use. Off-road, its low ex­haust pipe may hit big roots and rocks.</p>
    <p>A plus for the Fat Sab­bath, which has a 12-litre fuel tank, is its great fuel econ­omy. The bike can achieve about 33km on a litre of petrol.</p>
    <p>Its anti-lock brak­ing sys­tem and afore­men­tioned LED lights are the only mod­ern fea­tures you will find on this old-school charmer.</p>
