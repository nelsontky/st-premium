    <p>NOOR AYU MO­HAMED AMIN, 36</p>
    <p>Se­nior staff nurse Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal’s Ward 68 nurses found out that mi­grant work­ers who were be­ing dis­charged from the hos­pi­tal to com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties did not have un­con­tam­i­nated clean clothes to wear, they combed through their own wardrobes to donate clothes to the work­ers.</p>
    <p>“This caught the mi­grant work­ers by sur­prise, that we al­ready pro­vided them with care and now they are re­ceiv­ing new clothes as well. They were very ap­pre­cia­tive,” Ms Noor Ayu Mo­hamed Amin, 36, said. The se­nior staff nurse at Ward 68 added that it was sat­is­fy­ing to be able to con­nect with the pa­tients, as it was not easy to com­mu­ni­cate with them.</p>
    <p>She re­mem­bers check­ing in on a mi­grant worker in an iso­la­tion room. She was puz­zled to find him watch­ing TV and look­ing well as her col­league had told her that he did not pick up her phone calls.</p>
    <p>When she asked him if his bed­side phone was work­ing, he stared blankly at her.</p>
    <p>Re­al­is­ing that the mi­grant worker might not un­der­stand much English and could have been re­luc­tant to an­swer the phone, she used ges­tures to ask him if he had a cough or felt breath­less.</p>
    <p>“He said, ‘Oh! I’m okay, sis­ter.’ And he smiled,” said Ms Ayu.</p>
    <p>She added: “The big­gest chal­lenge I face when I nurse mi­grant work­ers is the lan­guage bar­rier.</p>
    <p>“But when we man­age to con­nect with the pa­tient, that is an achieve­ment.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ayu also works in the in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) of Ward 68, where she has seen a pa­tient die of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The bod­ies of those in­fected with Covid-19 are pre­pared for cre­ma­tion or burial by health­care work­ers in hospi­tals, and pro­to­cols in­clude dou­ble-bag­ging the bod­ies be­fore they are placed in air­tight coffins.</p>
    <p>“Fam­ily mem­bers are not al­lowed to go in­side the ICU and they can only look from out­side. In a way, there are no proper good­byes,” said Ms Ayu.</p>
    <p>“It is sad, you don’t know when was the last time they held one an­other. There­fore, it is so im­por­tant that we be there for the fam­ily as much as pos­si­ble and make the process smooth for them.”</p>
    <p>NO PROPER GOOD­BYES Fam­ily mem­bers are not al­lowed to go in­side the ICU and they can only look from out­side. In a way, there are no proper good­byes... It is sad, you don’t know when was the last time they held one an­other. ’’</p>
