    <p>ZURICH • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has listed Pfizer-BioNTech’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine for emer­gency use, in a move seek­ing to speed up ac­cess in the de­vel­op­ing world.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions health agency said it will work with re­gional part­ners to tell na­tional health au­thor­i­ties about the two-dose shot and its an­tic­i­pated ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>The WHO’s emer­gency use list­ing process aims to help poorer coun­tries with­out their own reg­u­la­tory re­sources to quickly ap­prove medicines for new dis­eases such as Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The agency’s re­view found Pfizer-BioNTech’s vac­cine met the must-have cri­te­ria for safety and ef­fi­cacy ben­e­fits out­weigh its risks.</p>
    <p>“This is a very pos­i­tive step to­wards en­sur­ing global ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines,” said Dr Mar­i­an­gela Si­mao, the leader of WHO’s ac­cess to medicines pro­gramme. “But I want to em­pha­sise the need for an even greater global ef­fort to achieve enough vac­cine sup­ply to meet the needs of pri­or­ity pop­u­la­tions ev­ery­where.”</p>
    <p>The UN health agency – with the Gavi Vac­cine Al­liance and the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions – is lead­ing a global ef­fort called Covax to se­cure and dis­trib­ute vac­cines to poorer coun­tries, to en­sure that shots do not go only to wealthy na­tions. Covax has agree­ments for nearly two bil­lion doses, with first de­liv­er­ies due early this year. The al­liance has been in talks with Pfizer-BioNTech to se­cure its vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Even so, the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine’s stor­age and de­liv­ery re­quire­ments, in­clud­ing keep­ing it at a tem­per­a­ture of mi­nus 70 deg C, have made de­liv­er­ies chal­leng­ing in Western coun­tries, and may pose big­ger hur­dles for de­vel­op­ing na­tions with­out ad­e­quate in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine has re­ceived reg­u­la­tory back­ing from Bri­tain, the Euro­pean Medicines Agency, the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion, as well as health au­thor­i­ties in Canada, Bahrain, Is­rael, Kuwait, Mex­ico, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Ara­bia and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pfizer-BioNTech’s mes­sen­ger RNA vac­cine has been found to be 95 per cent ef­fec­tive af­ter two doses 21 days apart.</p>
