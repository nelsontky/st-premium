    <p>Back in univer­sity, Sin­ga­pore­ans Solomon Poon and Ryan Foo, both 25, at­tended sev­eral net­work­ing events in their fi­nal year – many of which in­volved drink­ing al­co­hol while so­cial­is­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Poon re­calls: “Our faces would turn red after the first drink, which did not look pro­fes­sional.”</p>
    <p>While there are pills and drinks on the mar­ket that help mit­i­gate the ef­fects of hang­overs, “none were geared to­wards re­duc­ing the Asian flush”, he adds.</p>
    <p>The Asian flush refers to the phe­nom­e­non when some­one’s face turns red after drink­ing al­co­hol – com­mon among Asians of Chi­nese, Ja­panese and Korean de­scent.</p>
    <p>So Mr Poon, an eco­nom­ics grad­u­ate, and Mr Foo, a law grad­u­ate, de­cided to make their own prod­uct that can treat the al­co­hol flush.</p>
    <p>The duo – who grad­u­ated from the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) a year apart – came up with DrinkAid, a sup­ple­ment in a pill form that can be taken be­fore or after drink­ing – or both, depend­ing on how much is im­bibed.</p>
    <p>It claims to com­bat the neg­a­tive side ef­fects of al­co­hol con­sump­tion like the Asian flush and hang­overs.</p>
    <p>Launched in end-Au­gust, the pills are priced at $19.90 for a box of 12 cap­sules. Three boxes cost $49.90 and six boxes are $89.90. They can be pur­chased at drinkaid.co.</p>
    <p>The duo say the pills are man­u­fac­tured by a con­tract man­u­fac­turer in a GMP (Good Man­u­fac­tur­ing Prac­tice) cer­ti­fied fa­cil­ity in China, and are com­pli­ant with Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) sup­ple­ment guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Health sup­ple­ments are not sub­ject to ap­provals and li­cens­ing by HSA for their im­por­ta­tion, man­u­fac­ture and sales.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors who were ap­proached de­clined to com­ment on this prod­uct.</p>
    <p>The pair said they have had about 2,000 or­ders to date.</p>
    <p>The idea came about after they con­nected over their shared ex­pe­ri­ence of turn­ing red after drink­ing and a low tol­er­ance for al­co­hol con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­search and de­vel­op­ment took over a year.</p>
    <p>“We short­listed in­gre­di­ents that would break down ac­etalde­hyde – a byprod­uct of al­co­hol which causes the Asian flush and which is 10 times more toxic than al­co­hol,” says Mr Poon, who is also a cer­ti­fied nu­tri­tion­ist and has had ex­pe­ri­ence cre­at­ing a fat-loss sup­ple­ment.</p>
    <p>“Stud­ies have shown that around 50 per cent of Asians have a ge­netic de­fi­ciency of an en­zyme called alde­hyde de­hy­dro­ge­nase 2 (ALDH2) that im­pairs the break­down of ac­etalde­hyde,” he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“Since your body can­not pro­duce enough of the en­zyme, ac­etalde­hyde builds up to toxic lev­els quickly – hence the flush­ing,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home, they sourced raw in­gre­di­ents from sup­pli­ers used by ma­jor sup­ple­ment man­u­fac­tur­ers, orig­i­nat­ing in coun­tries like the United States, Ja­pan and China.</p>
    <p>After ex­per­i­ment­ing on them­selves for sev­eral months us­ing dif­fer­ent per­mu­ta­tions and ra­tios of in­gre­di­ents, they came up with a pro­to­type for DrinkAid at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>In­stead of the usual in­gre­di­ents like turmeric – which is found in many hang­over cures from Ja­pan and South Korea stocked here – they “looked in the places that no one looked”, in­clud­ing stud­ies writ­ten in Ital­ian and Rus­sian.</p>
    <p>Their key in­gre­di­ents in­clude gin­ger ex­tract, black pep­per ex­tract and Ja­panese raisin tree, which con­tains an ac­tive in­gre­di­ent (di­hy­dromyricet­in) which they say has been found to al­le­vi­ate headaches</p>
    <p>and nau­sea, curb liver dam­age from al­co­hol, as well as in­crease the break­down of ac­etalde­hyde.</p>
    <p>With the pro­to­type, the project was fur­ther de­vel­oped un­der SMU’s Busi­ness In­no­va­tions Gen­er­a­tor – an eq­uity-free in­cu­ba­tion pro­gramme man­aged by the univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of In­no­va­tion and En­trepreneur­ship, for start-ups in their early stages to re­fine their prod­uct and busi­ness plans.</p>
    <p>Along with pro­vid­ing a co-work­ing space at in­no­va­tion hub SMU Con­nex­ion, start-ups also re­ceive sup­port in the form of grant op­por­tu­ni­ties and ac­cess to men­tors and ad­vis­ers whom they can check in with on ma­jor mile­stones.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest ben­e­fit was the in­tro­duc­tion to rel­e­vant con­tacts in the in­dus­try,” Mr Poon notes.</p>
    <p>While they were un­able to get prod­uct ex­per­tise spe­cific to sup­ple­ments – since most of the ex­perts were more well-versed in the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try – they did get ad­vice on things like mak­ing sure their prod­uct is com­pli­ant with HSA guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Though the prod­uct l aunched only a little more than a month ago, they say they are now get­ting or­ders from all over the world.</p>
    <p>Down the line, they hope to ex­pand dis­tri­bu­tion to “coun­tries with the Asian flush prob­lem and a strong drink­ing cul­ture”, Mr Poon says.</p>
    <p>Among their re­turn clients is Mr Rudy Pierre Low, 39, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Luxe Events Pri­vate Lim­ited, which spe­cialises in boat par­ties.</p>
    <p>He has made DrinkAid avail­able at his net­work­ing events.</p>
    <p>But, he says, “I cau­tion my clients that this is not a mir­a­cle pill”.</p>
