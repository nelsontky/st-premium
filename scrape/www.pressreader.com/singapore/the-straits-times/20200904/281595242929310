    <p>Banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore will have ac­cess to more funds if they run into liq­uid­ity prob­lems due to the Covid-19 pan­demic. The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore is rolling out a Sin­ga­pore-dol­lar term fa­cil­ity to pre-empt and con­tain liq­uid­ity strains be­fore they be­come se­ri­ous chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore will have ac­cess to more funds if they run into liq­uid­ity prob­lems due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) is rolling out a Sin­ga­pore-dol­lar term fa­cil­ity to pre-empt and con­tain liq­uid­ity strains be­fore they be­come se­ri­ous chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“While banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore main­tain healthy liq­uid­ity buf­fers, MAS is introducin­g this fa­cil­ity pre-emp­tively to pro­vide greater cer­tainty of ac­cess to cen­tral bank liq­uid­ity,” an MAS state­ment said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure, which will be launched by the end of this month, comes on top of two other liq­uid­ity fa­cil­i­ties that the cen­tral bank has rolled out since the start of the Covid-19 cri­sis. They are the MAS USD fa­cil­ity and the MAS SGD fa­cil­ity for En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) loans.</p>
    <p>Ms Jac­que­line Loh, MAS’ deputy man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for mar­kets and de­vel­op­ment, said the mea­sures would strengthen the bank­ing sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“(They) en­able our banks to con­tinue to sup­port the needs of busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als here, and in the re­gion, through the cri­sis,” she said.</p>
    <p>Banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies are brac­ing them­selves for more de­faults as firms strug­gle to stay afloat amid the pan­demic and the prospect of relief mea­sures be­ing wound down by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal banks DBS, OCBC and United Over­seas Bank have all shored up their bal­ance sheets, even as they re­ported a de­cline in net prof­its in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>MAS said its lat­est fa­cil­ity would of­fer Sing­dol­lar funds in onemonth and three-month tenors, and a range of col­lat­eral – com­pris­ing cash and mar­ketable se­cu­ri­ties in Sing­dol­lar and ma­jor cur­ren­cies – will be ac­cepted.</p>
    <p>The col­lat­eral ac­cepted for its USD fa­cil­ity would also be ex­panded to in­clude the above.</p>
    <p>Banks in­cor­po­rated in Sin­ga­pore and cat­e­gorised as “do­mes­tic sys­tem­at­i­cally im­por­tant”, or D-SIBs, would also be al­lowed to pledge “el­i­gi­ble res­i­den­tial prop­erty loans as col­lat­eral” at the MAS SGD Term Fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cep­tance of res­i­den­tial prop­erty loans as col­lat­eral is only avail­able to D-SIBs and is in line with the prac­tices of ma­jor cen­tral banks,” MAS said.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pan­sion of ac­cept­able col­lat­eral will help these banks con­serve their more liq­uid in­stru­ments and strengthen the ef­fec­tive­ness of the MAS SGD Term Fa­cil­ity in pro­vid­ing liq­uid­ity sup­port.”</p>
    <p>CIMB Bank Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun de­scribed the MAS move as a safe­guard and a con­tin­gency plan against deeper eco­nomic cuts if the cur­rent “re­ces­sion­ary ten­sions do not ease”.</p>
    <p>More re­trench­ments and busi­ness clo­sures would af­fect re­pay­ment sched­ules for both re­tail and cor­po­rate cus­tomers, Mr Song said.</p>
    <p>“At this point, we re­ally don’t know how the pan­demic will pan out,” he added.</p>
    <p>Banks, in­clud­ing DBS and Stan­dard Char­tered, wel­comed the cen­tral bank’s move.</p>
    <p>Dr Andy So, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and head of trea­sury and liq­uid­ity man­age­ment at DBS, said: “While Sin­ga­pore banks have strong liq­uid­ity po­si­tions, these mea­sures will pro­vide greater cer­tainty of ac­cess to cen­tral bank liq­uid­ity in times of liq­uid­ity stress.”</p>
    <p>In July, MAS said it would be ex­tend­ing a US$60 bil­lion (S$82 bil­lion) swap fa­cil­ity with the United States Fed­eral Re­serve to fa­cil­i­tate lend­ing to busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore, af­ter set­ting up the fa­cil­ity in March.</p>
    <p>It estab­lished the MAS USD fa­cil­ity on March 26 to lend US dol­lars to banks in Sin­ga­pore. Both the swap line and MAS USD fa­cil­ity have been ex­tended to end-March next year.</p>
    <p>In April, MAS said it would of­fer near-zero in­ter­est rate loans to el­i­gi­ble banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies – at 0.1 per cent per an­num for a twoyear tenor – as part of an ef­fort to sup­port lend­ing to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises un­der ESG schemes.</p>
    <p>The SGD Term Fa­cil­ity will of­fer Sing­dol­lar funds in one-month and three-month tenors, and a range of col­lat­eral – com­pris­ing cash and mar­ketable se­cu­ri­ties in Sing­dol­lar and ma­jor cur­ren­cies – will be ac­cepted... Banks in­cor­po­rated in Sin­ga­pore and cat­e­gorised as “do­mes­tic sys­tem­at­i­cally im­por­tant” will also be al­lowed to pledge “el­i­gi­ble res­i­den­tial prop­erty loans as col­lat­eral”.</p>
