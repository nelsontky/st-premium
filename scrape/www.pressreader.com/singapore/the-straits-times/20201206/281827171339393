    <p>LON­DON • While the eco­nomic tur­moil wrought by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has left some peo­ple in Bri­tain count­ing every penny, the coun­try’s cen­tral bank is ap­par­ently hav­ing trou­ble keep­ing track of bil­lions of pounds.</p>
    <p>A par­lia­men­tary re­port re­leased on Fri­day said that £50 bil­lion (S$89.7 bil­lion) of pa­per money is “miss­ing” from the coun­try’s cash sup­ply and that the Bank of Eng­land “seems to l ack cu­rios­ity” about where it has all gone.</p>
    <p>Of the more than £70 bil­lion worth of bills in cir­cu­la­tion in Bri­tain, the re­port found that only about a quar­ter was be­ing spent in stores and on other pur­chases. That leaves the ma­jor­ity of those bills – which by de­sign are not trace­able – un­ac­counted for.</p>
    <p>The £50 bil­lion in cash may be hid­den away in un­re­ported house­hold sav­ings, squir­relled away for a rainy day or is be­ing used for more ne­far­i­ous pur­poses, Par­lia­ment’s Pub­lic Ac­counts Com­mit­tee said in the re­port, call­ing on the Bank of Eng­land to in­ves­ti­gate.</p>
    <p>“£50 bil­lion of ster­ling notes – or about three-quar­ters of this pre­cious and dwin­dling sup­ply – is stashed some­where but the Bank of Eng­land doesn’t know where, who by or what for – and doesn’t seem very cu­ri­ous,” said Ms Meg Hil­lier, the law­maker for the Hack­ney South and Shored­itch ar­eas of</p>
    <p>Lon­don and chair of the com­mit­tee that pro­duced the re­port.</p>
    <p>The Bank of Eng­land hit back at the sug­ges­tion that it was tak­ing a lais­sez-faire ap­proach to the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“It is the re­spon­si­bil­ity of the Bank of Eng­land to meet pub­lic de­mand for bank notes. The Bank has al­ways met that de­mand and will con­tinue to do so,” a spokesman from the cen­tral bank said in a state­ment on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Hil­lier said in an in­ter­view that the gap be­tween notes in cir­cu­la­tion and those ac­tu­ally be­ing used “must be linked to crime”.</p>
    <p>“Are more of us putting money un­der the mat­tress be­cause of Covid? It would have to be a lot of us do­ing that,” she said.</p>
    <p>The par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tee hopes an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the Bank of Eng­land may shed some light – if not on where it is be­ing held, then at least on the fac­tors be­hind the in­crease in de­mand for cash.</p>
    <p>The bank said the amount of pa­per money be­ing used for trans­ac­tions in Bri­tain – around 20 per cent to 25 per cent of all cash in cir­cu­la­tion – is broadly in line with other ma­jor economies.</p>
