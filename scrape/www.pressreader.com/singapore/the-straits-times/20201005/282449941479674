    <p>Sin­ga­porean chef Ken­neth Foong, 31, is the new head chef of ac­claimed restau­rant Noma in Copen­hagen.</p>
    <p>A Chan­nel NewsAsia ar­ti­cle re­ported that the for­mer head chef at Cure restau­rant in Keong Saik Road started work­ing at Noma two years ago as an in­tern.</p>
    <p>Nine months af­ter be­com­ing a full­timer, he was told the pre­vi­ous head chef, Cana­dian Ben­jamin Ing, would be leav­ing. The man­age­ment team agreed that Foong would be the “ideal can­di­date” to take over.</p>
    <p>Foong is no stranger to work­ing at prom­i­nent din­ing es­tab­lish­ments. He honed his skills at now-de­funct restau­rants Betony in New York and Restau­rant An­dre in Sin­ga­pore; as well as New York’s Eleven Madi­son Park.</p>
    <p>His Mex­i­can wife, whom he met while work­ing at Eleven Madi­son Park, is also a chef.</p>
    <p>In the ar­ti­cle, he de­scribes the en­ergy of work­ing at Noma as “pal­pa­ble” and “al­most elec­tric”.</p>
    <p>“It scares some, but for the in­di­vid­u­als that thrive off that en­ergy, they just lean in and soak it all up. I am one of those,” he says.</p>
    <p>The two-Miche­lin-starred Noma, set up in 2003, is run by Dan­ish chef Rene Redzepi.</p>
    <p>The New Nordic restau­rant was No. 1 on the World’s 50 Best Restau­rants list from 2010 to 2014 be­fore it closed in 2017 for a year. It re­turned to the list last year, ranked No. 2.</p>
    <p>Reser­va­tions are open for its up­com­ing Game & For­est sea­son, which high­lights meat and other pro­duce from the for­est such as berries, mush­rooms and nuts.</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, Noma re­opened as a wine and burger bar in May and Foong says they sold more than 40,000 burg­ers in five weeks.</p>
    <p>Af­ter news broke of his new ap­point­ment, the chef posted on his In­sta­gram: “To­day was a good day. I woke up to a flurry of well wishes and en­cour­age­ment. Got to go to a place I con­sider home, cook amongst peo­ple I con­sider fam­ily, and do work that I truly love.”</p>
