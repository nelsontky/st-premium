    <p>News that one of Sin­ga­pore’s best re­tail­ers, Robin­sons, will close down af­ter 162 years is very sad. I’ve been a fan since child­hood.</p>
    <p>JAZZ MU­SI­CIAN JEREMY MON­TEIRO, 60, in a Face­book post on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>I must say, for me per­son­ally, I cer­tainly feel a sense of loss be­cause Robin­sons has been part of our grow­ing-up years; it’s so much a part of Sin­ga­pore’s re­tail land­scape. MAN­POWER MIN­IS­TER JOSEPHINE TEO, 52</p>
    <p>I knew that they were down­siz­ing af­ter they an­nounced the clo­sure of their (Jem) out­let. But usu­ally when down­siz­ing hap­pens it’s a cost-cut­ting mea­sure that will help the busi­ness’ mar­gins im­prove. I didn’t ex­pect them to shut down.</p>
    <p>HOUSE­WIFE SUYAN HONG, 48, who was stunned by news of the im­pend­ing store clo­sures.</p>
    <p>I will miss Robin­sons be­cause you can walk in and touch and feel the items. I don’t like to buy them on­line. I will prob­a­bly be shop­ping at Metro or Tangs, but I hope they don’t close down soon.</p>
    <p>MS MAG­GIE HO, 61, a re­tired ac­coun­tant</p>
    <p>Such sad news. I grew up with Robin­sons... My mum used to take me there when I was a kid. It’s re­ally sad that old busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore can never sus­tain here. I go to other coun­tries and their de­part­men­tal stores are some­times passed down from gen­er­a­tion to gen­er­a­tion. In fact most of my child­hood hang­outs are gone, noth­ing to show (the) next gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>We should not have sold it (Robin­sons) to for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>VET­ERAN DIPLO­MAT TOMMY KOH, 82, com­mented in a re­ply to Mr Mon­teiro’s post.</p>
    <p>MISS RINA MALAKAR, 52, on Face­book page The Long and Wind­ing Road.</p>
    <p>It’s sad to hear that Robin­sons store, opened in Sin­ga­pore since 1858, is clos­ing down. End of an era. It was set up at a time when Sin­ga­pore seemed quite doomed to fail­ure, when all the nut­meg plan­ta­tions along Or­chard Road were fail­ing, and no one could imag­ine the shop­ping par­adise Sin­ga­pore has be­come to­day. NE­TI­ZEN FUNG SING, in a Face­book post where she shared a poem writ­ten by her daugh­ter for the store.</p>
