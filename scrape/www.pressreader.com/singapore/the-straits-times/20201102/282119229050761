    <p>The High Court has ac­quit­ted a Filipino do­mes­tic worker, who was jailed for 12 months by a district judge for steal­ing her then 89-year-old em­ployer’s ATM cards and with­draw­ing a to­tal of $8,000 from his bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Ms Portela Vilma Jimenez, now 50, was found guilty of 10 charges of theft by District Judge Jasven­der Kaur ear­lier this year, for steal­ing two ATM cards be­long­ing to Mr Yong Choon Hiong and mak­ing eight unau­tho­rised with­drawals of $1,000 each from his bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The with­drawals, which were cap­tured on closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion (CCTV) footage, were made on six oc­ca­sions be­tween Jan 13, 2017 and Feb 8, 2017. Seven trans­ac­tions in­volved Mr Yong’s United Over­seas Bank ATM card, and one was made with his POSB ATM card.</p>
    <p>Both the pros­e­cu­tion and the de­fence did not dis­pute that the with­drawals were made.</p>
    <p>But Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Sia Ji­azheng said Ms Jimenez had done so with­out Mr Yong’s knowl­edge af­ter steal­ing the ATM cards.</p>
    <p>Coun­ter­ing, de­fence lawyers Suang Wi­jaya and Syazana Yahya said she was al­lowed to make the with­drawals in ex­change for sex­ual favours she gave to her el­derly em­ployer.</p>
    <p>High Court Judge Chua Lee Ming, who heard the ap­peal and over­turned the con­vic­tion, has not is­sued a writ­ten judg­ment.</p>
    <p>But Ms Jimenez’s lawyers said Jus­tice Chua did not agree that the pros­e­cu­tion had proven be­yond a rea­son­able doubt that Mr Yong did not hand the ATM cards to her.</p>
    <p>Ms Jimenez, who had worked in Sin­ga­pore and Kuwait for 20 years, worked for Mr Yong and his wife from De­cem­ber 2015 to April 2017.</p>
    <p>As Mr Yong’s wife suf­fers from de­men­tia and has to use a wheel­chair, Ms Jimenez had ac­cess to the cou­ple’s room so she could take care of the el­derly woman at night.</p>
    <p>The DPP said this was how she was able to re­move Mr Yong’s ATM cards from his wal­let, which he would leave in a drawer at night.</p>
    <p>The DPP also said Ms Jimenez would have known Mr Yong’s per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber (PIN), which was the same for both cards, as she of­ten went gro­cery shop­ping with the el­derly cou­ple and would have seen him punch­ing in the num­bers when he made pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong had said he first dis­cov­ered the unau­tho­rised with­drawals from his ac­counts when he re­ceived his Jan­uary 2017 bank state­ments in Fe­bru­ary that year.</p>
    <p>He said he had gone to UOB in early Fe­bru­ary to ask the bank about the mat­ter and filed com­plaints on Feb 21 dur­ing a visit to open a joint ac­count with his son.</p>
    <p>He made a po­lice re­port the next day, as he was told that he would not be able to view the CCTV footage with­out one.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Wi­jaya and Ms Syazana dis­puted Mr Yong’s ver­sion of events. They said he had passed his ATM cards to Ms Jimenez and writ­ten his PIN num­ber on a piece of pa­per for her, so that she could with­draw money in ex­change for sex­ual favours.</p>
    <p>They con­tended that Mr Yong had agreed to pay her $500 each time she al­lowed him to touch her breasts and crotch, and that she was paid on four oc­ca­sions for this.</p>
    <p>They also said Mr Yong had made a po­lice re­port as he had lied to his fam­ily about the unau­tho­rised with­drawals af­ter they found out about them.</p>
    <p>In court, Ms Jimenez said Mr Yong had also agreed to pay her twice for sex­ual in­ter­course, though it did not hap­pen in the end as he was un­able to pen­e­trate her on one oc­ca­sion and she did not agree to it on an­other.</p>
    <p>She also said she did not know how to use the ATM and had thus just pressed a but­ton, lead­ing to $1,000 be­ing dis­pensed each time. But she said she would give the money to Mr Yong, who would then keep $500 and give her $500.</p>
    <p>Judge Kaur, who con­victed Ms Jimenez, said the of­fences were com­mit­ted against “a vul­ner­a­ble vic­tim” of ad­vanced age, who was al­ready 91 when he had to tes­tify in court. Judge Kaur also found that her ev­i­dence was rid­dled with in­con­sis­ten­cies.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Ms Jimenez had said she re­mem­bered with­draw­ing money only four times, though the CCTV footage showed that she had with­drawn money eight times.</p>
    <p>Ms Jimenez had also said she did not know how to use the ATM, though she had a DBS Bank ac­count and an ATM card of her own.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ms Jimenez’ lawyers, Jus­tice Chua had found it was Mr Yong’s ev­i­dence that was in­con­sis­tent, rather than the maid’s. A key fac­tor was the fact that he had waited for three weeks be­fore re­port­ing the with­drawals.</p>
    <p>The ac­quit­tal has gained trac­tion among some ne­ti­zens, with some draw­ing com­par­isons to the Parti Liyani case, which in­volved an­other maid who was ac­quit­ted by the High Court of steal­ing from her em­ployer, Mr Liew Mun Leong.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti’s case has prompted in­ter­nal re­views by the Home Af­fairs and Law min­istries.</p>
