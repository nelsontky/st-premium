    <p>He has not lost hope de­spite be­ing owed two months’ salary.</p>
    <p>The In­dian na­tional, who gave his name only as Mr Raj, said things ap­pear to be go­ing back to nor­mal even though some of his com­pa­tri­ots had to re­cently be put on stay­home no­tice (SHN) for a sec­ond time, this round for 14 days.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand my boss’ prob­lems as ev­ery­one suf­fered dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker when there was no work,” said Mr Raj, who is in his mid-40s and works as a driver.</p>
    <p>“From June on­ward, I restarted work and got my monthly $750 pay. I just have to tahan be­cause my boss promised to re­pay my April and May salaries,” he said, us­ing the Malay term for “en­dure”.</p>
    <p>Mr Raj, who has been work­ing in Sin­ga­pore for more than 10 years, ad­mit­ted he was fear­ful when talk of a sec­ond lock­down last month be­gan to spread on What­sApp.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately for him, he does not stay in a pur­pose-built dor­mi­tory, oth­er­wise there was a chance he would also be quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>While look­ing for a new job in May, dur­ing the pe­riod his em­ployer had not paid his salary, he re­alised the present job mar­ket was gloomy.</p>
    <p>“I’m still search­ing, but em­ploy­ers said there are no va­can­cies for for­eign work­ers,” added Mr Raj. “What is im­por­tant is I still have a job.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, for­eign work­ers in the con­struc­tion line may not share Mr Raj’s views that the fu­ture will get bet­ter.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty of go­ing through an­other four-month SHN stint in Sungei Ten­gah Lodge weighs heav­ily on Mr Bikramjit Singh’s mind.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­sum­ing work for about two weeks last month af­ter not hav­ing worked for four months, he re­ceived un­ex­pected news.</p>
    <p>On Aug 22, Mr Singh, 32, was among 4,800 work­ers placed in quar­an­tine when a coron­avirus clus­ter was de­tected in the Sungei Ten­gah dorm.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh, who erects scaf­fold­ing for a liv­ing, wor­ries a lot about his fi­nances.</p>
    <p>“Like ev­ery­one, I send some of my salary to my par­ents in In­dia ev­ery month,” said Mr Singh, who earns about $800 and has post­poned his wed­ding at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>“But I don’t know how long my com­pany can stay in busi­ness when 30 per cent of its work­ers are in quar­an­tine.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh, the el­der of two sons, wires home $500 for his fam­ily’s food, wa­ter and power bills, as well as to re­pay a bank loan taken to fi­nance his re­turn to Sin­ga­pore last year.</p>
    <p>He first came to Sin­ga­pore in 2009 – go­ing back to Pun­jab in 2017 and re­turn­ing here last year – and is cur­rently em­ployed in a medi­um­sized con­struc­tion com­pany.</p>
    <p>Added Mr Singh, who has so far taken six Covid-19 swab tests: “Af­ter four months of SHN, I was so happy to see my other col­leagues who were stay­ing in an Alju­nied ho­tel. They joked that I looked bet­ter be­cause I’m now skin­nier af­ter los­ing 10kg.”</p>
    <p>At se­nior man­age­ment lev­els, for­eign work­ers’ con­cerns are be­ing heard.</p>
    <p>Mr Hooi Yu Koh, 49, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Kori Hold­ings, said some work­ers are pres­sured by their fam­i­lies to re­turn home.</p>
    <p>“Fam­i­lies are gravely con­cerned that go­ing back to quar­an­tine means there is a health risk again,” said Mr Hooi, who has 200 for­eign work­ers in his com­pany.</p>
    <p>“We al­ways pro­vide the as­sur­ance that the au­thor­i­ties are do­ing their part to keep work­ers safe.”</p>
    <p>Man­agers The Straits Times spoke to agreed that video calls for­eign work­ers make back home have helped to ease some anx­i­ety among their loved ones.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent mea­sures to con­tain the spread of the Covid-19 virus have made it im­pos­si­ble for one con­struc­tion di­rec­tor to visit his work­ers’ dorms per­son­ally to check on their wel­fare – some­thing Mr David Ng used to do each day be­fore the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>On Aug 10, Mr Ng, 61, di­rec­tor of Iso-Team Cor­po­ra­tion, was told that a 30-year-old Myan­mar em­ployee had ap­par­ently taken his life at a tem­po­rary hous­ing fa­cil­ity at the Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub.</p>
    <p>He was the only worker from IsoTeam stay­ing at the fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, whose com­pany hires 300 for­eign work­ers, said: “We were taken aback at his demise. The worker ap­peared happy, telling his col­leagues that he had re­ceived the green code. He was also due for a work per­mit re­newal med­i­cal check-up.”</p>
    <p>But some work­ers choose to keep their wor­ries to them­selves.</p>
    <p>The Myan­mar na­tional, who was a pain­ter, leaves his wife and two chil­dren – a daugh­ter, five, and a son, three.</p>
    <p>At the fu­neral, the dead man’s brother-in-law, who works in Sin­ga­pore, told Mr Ng he could have been de­pressed about rais­ing money for his son’s treat­ment for a head tu­mour.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng was shown fam­ily pho­to­graphs and an X-ray of the boy’s skull.</p>
    <p>Iso-Team is in the process of wiring do­na­tions to the worker’s wife.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies are gravely con­cerned that go­ing back to quar­an­tine means there is a health risk again. We al­ways pro­vide the as­sur­ance that the au­thor­i­ties are do­ing their part to keep work­ers safe.</p>
    <p>MR HOOI YU KOH, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Kori Hold­ings, say­ing some work­ers are pres­sured by their fam­i­lies to re­turn home.</p>
