    <p>PARIS • Bou­tiques in the cen­tre of the French cap­i­tal shut early and shop­pers hur­ried home to meet a new 8pm cur­few to try to pre­vent a new spike in Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“I com­pletely lost track of time and didn’t re­alise it was so late,” said 40-year-old Paris res­i­dent Jun, who was in the Opera district just be­fore cur­few on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to head home.”</p>
    <p>Around the usu­ally bustling shop­ping district, shopfronts were dark, and of the few peo­ple on the streets, most were head­ing to­wards metro sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Tues­day also brought new free­doms of a sort for peo­ple in France be­cause it was the end of a stay-ath­ome or­der. This had meant that, around the clock, peo­ple could ven­ture out – if only for a lim­ited pe­riod and for es­sen­tial trips, to shop, or to ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>How­ever, that was re­placed in­stead with a nightly cur­few. From 8pm un­til 6am, peo­ple can go out only for work, on of­fi­cial busi­ness, or for med­i­cal rea­sons. Any­one break­ing cur­few is li­able to be fined €135 (S$219).</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have warned that they will be strictly en­forc­ing the new rules.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Darmanin on Tues­day even­ing joined a po­lice pa­trol in Yve­lines, west of Paris, to check that peo­ple were com­ply­ing.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has de­cided to be par­tic­u­larly tough on un­law­ful par­ties,” the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tion rates in France have de­clined sharply since the peak of the sec­ond wave last month. But sci­en­tists warn of the risk of a third wave of in­fec­tion if peo­ple let down their guard dur­ing the Christ­mas and New Year hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients in in­ten­sive care – the most im­por­tant mea­sure of a health sys­tem’s abil­ity to deal with the pan­demic – also went down by 25 to 2,881, re­sum­ing a con­tin­u­ous de­cline since Nov 17.</p>
    <p>That fig­ure is still within the tar­get level of 2,500 to 3,000 that the gov­ern­ment had set to de­cide the end of the lock­down that was put in place on Oct 30 and was lifted on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>But be­cause the num­ber of daily new in­fec­tions has failed to fall be­low the 5,000 thresh­old – an­other of­fi­cial tar­get – the gov­ern­ment has opted for a less ex­ten­sive loos­en­ing of re­stric­tive mea­sures than ini­tially planned.</p>
    <p>The health author­i­ties re­ported 11,532 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions over the past 24 hours, up from Mon­day’s 3,063, but largely sta­ble from Sun­day’s 11,533.</p>
    <p>Case num­bers gen­er­ally dip on Mon­days as there are fewer tests con­ducted on Sun­days.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple in France who have died from Covid-19 rose by 790 to 59,072, up from 371 on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The cu­mu­la­tive num­ber of cases in France now to­tals 2,391,447, the fifth-high­est in the world.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A pedes&#xAD;trian in the Champs El&#xAD;y&#xAD;sees in Paris on Tues&#xAD;day, the day a new nightly cur&#xAD;few came into force in France with the aim of try&#xAD;ing to pre&#xAD;vent an&#xAD;other spike in Covid-19 in&#xAD;fec&#xAD;tions.
