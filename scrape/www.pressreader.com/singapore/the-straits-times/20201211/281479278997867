    <p>Say “no” when your child asks to use your work lap­top to do his school­work, or set up a dif­fer­ent user ac­count on the work lap­top for dif­fer­ent ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There are ways to reset habits and prac­tices for a more dig­i­tally se­cure 2021 as work­ing and e-learn­ing from home be­come the new nor­mal even after Covid-19, said pan­el­lists at The Straits Times Reset 2021 We­bi­nar Se­ries: Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion And Cy­ber Se­cu­rity on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees who are also par­ents need to be aware of key dig­i­tal as­sets, such as e-mail ac­cess, that have to be pro­tected when work has moved into the home en­vi­ron­ment, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Steven Wong from the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“What are the key as­sets that you have in your home that, if com­pro­mised, will im­pact your fam­ily, your busi­ness and your work? It could be your e-mail, or cer­tain ap­proval pro­cesses,” said Prof Wong.</p>
    <p>“Start to iden­tify some of these (as­sets) and take a ‘com­pro­misedby-de­fault’ po­si­tion, so that you are pre­pared and will not be... at a loss when some­thing happens.</p>
    <p>“In cor­po­rate set­tings, this is known as in­ci­dent re­sponse, but very sel­dom does it hap­pen at home be­cause it’s not our cul­ture (yet) to do so.”</p>
    <p>The other three pan­el­lists were Mr David Koh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore; As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chang Ee-Chien from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore School of Com­put­ing; and Mr Ben­jamin Ang, head of the Cy­ber and Home­land De­fence Pro­gramme at the Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence for Na­tional Se­cu­rity, a pol­icy re­search think-tank.</p>
    <p>Prof Chang sug­gested seg­re­gat­ing de­vices at home by in­di­vid­ual or work­flow. For ex­am­ple, as far as pos­si­ble, chil­dren should use a dif­fer­ent desk­top or lap­top from the ones their par­ents use for work.</p>
    <p>“If that is not pos­si­ble, then try to seg­re­gate by set­ting up dif­fer­ent user ac­counts on a lap­top. Even if you have your own ma­chine, you can seg­re­gate ac­counts for work, for fam­ily, or for play­ing games,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Se­gre­ga­tion is about set­ting up se­cu­rity pa­ram­e­ters, so that when some­thing happens within that pa­ram­e­ter it will not spill over to other (areas).”</p>
    <p>Mr Koh and Prof Wong also warned against think­ing that tech­nol­ogy can serve as a cure-all or sil­ver bul­let for pro­tect­ing per­sonal data and stay­ing safe on­line.</p>
    <p>Prof Wong said there is a wor­ry­ing ten­dency for peo­ple who are more tech-savvy to as­sume that they are safe sim­ply be­cause they are fa­mil­iar with the work­ings of the dig­i­tal world, or be­cause they have adopted cer­tain tech­nol­ogy like vir­tual pri­vate net­works (VPNs).</p>
    <p>A VPN anonymises users’ In­ter­net brows­ing ac­tiv­ity by send­ing Web traf­fic through an en­crypted tun­nel to a net­work con­trolled by the VPN ser­vice provider.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some VPN providers, es­pe­cially those of­fer­ing their ser­vices for free, may not be what they claim, Prof Wong said.</p>
    <p>“It’s as if to­day, some­one tells me, ‘give me your wal­let and I’ll keep it safe for you. I’m free, re­li­able and eas­ily ac­ces­si­ble’. But you just don’t do that in nor­mal phys­i­cal life... These are op­por­tu­ni­ties cy­ber crim­i­nals will use,” he added.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge with dig­i­tal na­tives is that some­times, they think they know ev­ery­thing. But ac­tu­ally, none of us know, be­cause (be­ing on your guard in the dig­i­tal world) is not an in­her­ent sense that we are born with.</p>
    <p>“And that’s a sense – a sixth sense – we need to de­velop be­cause the phys­i­cal and dig­i­tal worlds op­er­ate in very dif­fer­ent ways. In the phys­i­cal world, there’s a perime­ter to nearly ev­ery­thing, but it’s the op­po­site in the dig­i­tal world.”</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the na­ture of What­sApp hi­jack­ing cases, where hack­ers pre­tend to be friends of the vic­tims in or­der to ask for their What­sApp ver­i­fi­ca­tion codes, Mr Koh said the scam hinges not on tech­nol­ogy but on “so­cial en­gi­neer­ing”.</p>
    <p>“Be sus­pi­cious. You have to ask, why are you con­tact­ing me and ask­ing for a six-digit PIN? And the eas­i­est thing is just to pick up the phone and call the per­son and ask if it’s re­ally them,” Mr Koh said.</p>
    <p>“Not all tech­ni­cal prob­lems need a tech­ni­cal so­lu­tion. Some­times, a sim­ple process or be­ing a bit more care­ful can solve the is­sue.”</p>
    <p>The IT world is mov­ing at a very fast rate. Even those of us who are in the busi­ness find it very dif­fi­cult to keep pace. But you don’t need to keep pace with ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>It’s not about buy­ing the lat­est tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>I don’t buy the lat­est soft­ware, I don’t buy the lat­est com­puter, but I make sure that those I have are up­dated.</p>
    <p>MR DAVID KOH, CEO of the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
