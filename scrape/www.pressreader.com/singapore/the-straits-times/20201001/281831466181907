    <p>The Jakarta ad­min­is­tra­tion is set­ting up a 2ha plot of land in Rorotan pub­lic ceme­tery in North Jakarta for Covid-19 graves as burial space for vic­tims of the coro­n­avirus in the cap­i­tal city is run­ning out.</p>
    <p>Jakarta Bina Marga road agency head Hari Nu­groho said the ad­min­is­tra­tion was cur­rently pre­par­ing the land to be used for buri­als and build­ing the nec­es­sary in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“We’re pre­par­ing the land and build­ing a road to ac­cess the ceme­tery. Con­struc­tion progress is at 4 per cent,” Mr Hari said on Mon­day, as quoted by news site Tempo.co.</p>
    <p>The agency will also level the land sur­face to make the burial process eas­ier. The project was started on Sept 17 and is ex­pected to be com­pleted in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect this 2ha burial space to ac­com­mo­date 6,000 fu­ner­als,” Mr Hari said.</p>
    <p>The city ad­min­is­tra­tion pro­vided the ad­di­tional land for Covid-19 graves as coro­n­avirus cases i n Jakarta have con­tin­ued to rise and burial grounds des­ig­nated for vic­tims have started to run out.</p>
    <p>Mr Nadi, the man­age­ment of­fi­cer of Pon­dok Rang­gon pub­lic ceme­tery in East Jakarta, said on Sept 14 that there was space left for only an­other 1,100 Covid-19 buri­als in the ceme­tery’s south­ern area of 7,000 sq m.</p>
    <p>The ca­pac­ity would likely be at a crit­i­cal state in the mid­dle of this month, he added, and it was es­ti­mated that, this month, the re­main­ing land may be able to ac­com­mo­date only 380 to 400 bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic hit the coun­try in March, 6,248 bod­ies have been buried in ac­cor­dance with Covid-19 pro­to­cols in Jakarta. Last month, the cap­i­tal city recorded 1,372 Covid-19-re­lated buri­als, mark­ing the high­est monthly rise yet.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 death toll among</p>
    <p>doc­tors has also been a cause for con­cern, with In­done­sia’s Health Min­istry form­ing a team to in­ves­ti­gate the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“(The team) has just been formed by the Health Min­istry,” In­done­sian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion (IDI) chair­man Daeng M. Faqih said on Mon­day, as quoted by Kom­pas.com. “IDI hopes this team can get straight to work to find the best so­lu­tion to pro­tect health work­ers.”</p>
    <p>He added that IDI had worked closely with the na­tional Covid-19 task force and the Health Min­istry to pro­vide per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and free swab tests for health work­ers and also helped in the for­ma­tion of the au­dit team.</p>
    <p>As of Tues­day, the as­so­ci­a­tion had recorded 127 Covid-19 deaths among doc­tors, 65 of whom were gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers and 56 were spe­cial­ists, IDI spokesman Ha­lik Ma</p>
    <p>lik told The Jakarta Post.</p>
    <p>East Java had recorded the most deaths among doc­tors at 30, fol­lowed by North Su­ma­tra with 21 deaths and Jakarta with 16. The In­done­sian Nurses As­so­ci­a­tion also told the Post that as of Tues­day, at least 92 nurses had died of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, In­done­sia’s House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives mem­bers have called on Health Min­is­ter Ter­awan Agus Pu­tranto to re­work his commu</p>
    <p>nica­tion skills fol­low­ing a se­ries of pub­lic gaffes that ap­pear to have led him to lie low de­spite the coun­try’s bat­tle against the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, Mr Ter­awan seems to have made fewer pub­lic ap­pear­ance af­ter crit­ics lam­basted him for creat­ing nu­mer­ous con­tro­ver­sies, in­clud­ing by play­ing down the Covid-19 threat at the start of the out­break in the coun­try, de­spite his po­si­tion lead­ing the na­tional ef­forts</p>
    <p>against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Emanuel Melki­ades Laka Lena, the chair­man of House Com­mis­sion IX over­see­ing health­care, ac­knowl­edged that the min­is­ter had dis­played rather poor com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills, though he deemed that Mr Ter­awan had done a good enough job in han­dling the virus cri­sis as proven dur­ing pre­vi­ous hear­ings with the leg­isla­tive body.</p>
