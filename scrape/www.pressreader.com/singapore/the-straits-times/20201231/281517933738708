    <p>A once-in-a-century global pan­demic has dis­rupted lives, killed peo­ple, up­ended com­merce, shut­tered busi­nesses, de­stroyed jobs and sim­ply caused un­told chaos to the or­der in our lives.</p>
    <p>One of the dark­est shad­ows it cast was the way it re­in­forced in­equities.</p>
    <p>Lower-skilled and blue-col­lar work­ers have borne the brunt of the global lock­downs and job losses. In con­trast, more ed­u­cated work­ers, es­pe­cially fi­nan­cially and tech-savvy folk, man­aged to ride out the storm and work from home (WFH).</p>
    <p>Com­ing out of this pan­demic, in­come dis­par­ity and the wealth gap can widen fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Many in the lower eco­nomic rungs of so­ci­ety could con­tinue to suf­fer from the fi­nan­cial rav­ages of the pan­demic, weighed down by job in­se­cu­rity, lower in­come and debt. But the pan­demic also ac­cel­er­ated the dig­i­tal and tech revo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the lock­downs, about 80 per cent of the white-col­lar work­force was de­ployed un­der WFH regimes, cre­at­ing a cot­tage in­dus­try in every­thing from e-meet­ings and e-sem­i­nars to e-sales and emar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>On­line tele­con­fer­enc­ing, chats and dis­cus­sions and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing have sped up the jour­ney to­wards a dig­i­tal econ­omy. On­line shop­ping has soared.</p>
    <p>The ad­vent of 5G and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence will fur­ther in­ten­sify these trends. The pan­demic has thrown the spot­light on ex­is­ten­tial is­sues such as pol­lu­tion, re­source de­ple­tion, clean wa­ter and air. Rapid pop­u­la­tion growth and ur­ban­i­sa­tion, cou­pled with rapid degra­da­tion of na­ture, are putting pressure on many re­sources.</p>
    <p>Given that 18 of the hottest years on earth oc­curred dur­ing the past 20 years, there is an ur­gent im­per­a­tive to find in­no­va­tive al­ter­na­tive en­ergy sources, while also deal­ing with fu­ture chal­lenges aris­ing from re­source scarcity.</p>
    <p>Hence, is­sues of en­vi­ron­ment, sus­tain­abil­ity and gov­er­nance (ESG) will loom ever larger.</p>
    <p>To­tal global in­vest­ment in re­new­ables ex­ceeded US$180 bil­lion (S$238 bil­lion) last year, and is ex­pected to have risen by al­most 20 per cent this year. Green bonds have been at­tract­ing new funds and will con­tinue to grow. In time, ESG will be a key pa­ram­e­ter for in­vest­ment de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>For na­tions, the pan­demic has also fo­cused minds on sup­ply chain pri­or­i­ties, and par­tic­u­larly food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The clo­sure of bor­ders high­lighted the dan­gers of over-de­pen</p>
    <p>dence on any sin­gle sup­ply source. Coun­tries have learnt that they will have to di­ver­sify their sources.</p>
    <p>To avoid strate­gic weak­nesses and vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties, many coun­tries will go dig­i­tal and lo­cal. This means hav­ing the abil­ity to quickly source crit­i­cal prod­ucts and, per­haps, move some of the man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses closer to home.</p>
    <p>Some of the most no­tice­able changes are likely to be in the work­place where, for the first time in his­tory, the well-be­ing of em­ploy­ees will be­come a ma­jor fo­cus. The pan­demic, after all, be­gan to spread largely at work­places and worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies will also have to im­ple­ment work­able busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plans.</p>
    <p>This cri­sis has taught the cor­po­rate world that, with the right tech­nol­ogy i n place, not ev­ery­one needs to be at the same place, at the same time. Even deals can now be inked dig­i­tally. This could im­pact de­mand for busi­ness travel world­wide.</p>
    <p>An­other les­son in­di­vid­u­als and cor­po­rates have learnt from this cri­sis is the need to main­tain suf­fi­cient funds to tide them over un­pre­dictable and dif­fi­cult pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate fi­nan­cial re­silience will de­pend on a com­pany’s abil­ity to build up enough fat on the bal­ance sheets and keep gear­ing low. For in­di­vid­u­als, this could mean sav­ing enough to weather six months of go­ing with­out a job. Cash flow is crit­i­cal dur­ing crunch time.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, with fi­nan­cial mar­kets flush with liq­uid­ity (it is es­ti­mated there is US$4.3 tril­lion slosh­ing around in global money mar­kets), in­ter­est rates will re­main low for sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Offered Rate, or Si­bor, is un­der 0.5 per cent, com­pared with al­most 1.5 per cent over a year ago.</p>
    <p>While low in­ter­est rates are good for busi­nesses and fi­nan­cial mar­kets, they can mean lower re­turns on re­tire­ment sav­ings, ed­u­ca­tion funds and even in­ter-gen­er­a­tional trans­fers.</p>
    <p>On the geopo­lit­i­cal front, a new ad­min­is­tra­tion in the United States un­der Pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den could see a less ran­corous world. Mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism could re-emerge as a force for good, par­tic­u­larly in en­vi­ron­men­tal man­age­ment and global health is­sues.</p>
    <p>This would be i mpor­tant as many sci­en­tists be­lieve the next pan­demic may be round the corner, no thanks to global cli­mate change and en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion.</p>
