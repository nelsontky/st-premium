    <p>Shell Sin­ga­pore has drawn up a 10-year plan to cut CO2 emis­sions from its op­er­a­tions here by about a third.</p>
    <p>The plan builds on Shell’s over­ar­ch­ing am­bi­tion to elim­i­nate all of its own emis­sions and the bulk of green­house gases from the fuel it sells to cus­tomers by 2050.</p>
    <p>The plan was out­lined in 2017, but this year’s col­lapse of the oil mar­ket amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – with con­sump­tion and prices fall­ing to his­toric lows – ac­cel­er­ated the move.</p>
    <p>Ms Aw Kah Peng, chair­man of Shell Com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore, said the pan­demic came as a re­al­ity check, draw­ing par­al­lels to what could hap­pen if prepa­ra­tions are not made for the worst-case sce­nar­ios as­so­ci­ated with cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“We al­ready had our emis­sion goals and low-car­bon en­ergy plans, but Covid-19 made us fo­cus on the chal­lenge of the tran­si­tion even more. We re­alised what may hap­pen if we are un­able to man­age cli­mate change,” she told The Straits Times in an in­ter­view yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Shell’s par­ent Royal Dutch Shell de­cided to cut its global re­fin­ing port­fo­lio to six en­ergy and chem­i­cals parks, from its cur­rent 14 sites.</p>
    <p>Shell aims to have net-zero emis­sions from its own op­er­a­tions – cat­e­gories known as scope one and two – by 2050.</p>
    <p>It also in­tends to sell prod­ucts with lower car­bon in­ten­sity, such as re­new­able power, bio­fu­els and hy­dro­gen, thereby cut­ting its scope three emis­sions by around 30 per cent by 2035 and 65 per cent by 2050.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Pu­lau Bukom Man­u­fac­tur­ing Site – one of the six parks – will pivot from a crude oil­based prod­uct slate to­wards new, cleaner fu­els.</p>
    <p>Ms Aw said the com­pany will re­duce its crude-pro­cess­ing ca­pac­ity by about half – to 250,000 bar­rels a day from the cur­rent 500,000 – to de­liver a sig­nif­i­cant re­duc­tion in CO2 emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Aided by a sitewide dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion pro­gramme, the Bukom re­fin­ery will be re­con­fig­ured to pro­duce cleaner fu­els like bio­fu­els and more spe­cial­i­ties like bi­tu­men, she said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is also look­ing at the pos­si­bil­ity of us­ing dif­fer­ent feed­stocks and re­new­able raw ma­te­ri­als, such as re­cy­cled chem­i­cals.</p>
    <p>As Bukom trans­forms and be­comes smaller and smarter, the re­siz­ing of op­er­a­tions will re­sult in fewer but more highly skilled jobs as dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and au­to­ma­tion progress.</p>
    <p>The 1,300-strong Bukom work­force will be cut to 1,100 by the end of next year, and will be down­sized to 800 in an­other two years.</p>
    <p>The re­duc­tion in crude re­fin­ing ca­pac­ity will be achieved at a faster pace, prob­a­bly in the next year or two.</p>
    <p>To drive the tran­si­tion, Shell will have to in­crease in­vest­ments in its own as­sets and, crit­i­cally, in its own peo­ple, said Ms Aw.</p>
    <p>“Fig­ur­ing out how to get there will mean ask­ing our own peo­ple, and re­think­ing our busi­ness model and our un­der­stand­ing of the cus­tomer – what is the cus­tomer look­ing for and how would we serve our cus­tomer,” she added.</p>
    <p>Shell will also need to part­ner key stake­hold­ers and cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>In that re­gard, some of the broader en­ergy tran­si­tion ini­tia­tives in­clude look­ing into util­i­tyscale so­lar gen­er­a­tion to build on the more than 3 megawatt-peak Shell has al­ready built at its Pandan dis­tri­bu­tion ter­mi­nal, Sele­tar avi­a­tion site and Tuas Lubri­cants Plant.</p>
    <p>By 2030, Shell Sin­ga­pore aims to have an ex­ten­sive net­work of elec­tric ve­hi­cle-charg­ing op­tions for its cus­tomers, all within a short drive, from their home, work­place or when they are on the go.</p>
    <p>In ship­ping, its LNG bunker­ing joint ven­ture with Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine, FueLNG, will scale up with the ar­rival of Sin­ga­pore’s first bunker­ing ves­sel late this year, con­tribut­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s am­bi­tion to de­car­bonise ship­ping.</p>
    <p>Shell is also work­ing with the Na</p>

    <p>Given its global ex­pe­ri­ence in trad­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal prod­ucts – in schemes such as Euro­pean Union Al­lowances, United States cap-and­trade pro­grammes, US CO2 com­pli­ance fu­tures – Shell is en­gag­ing its cus­tomers in Sin­ga­pore to pro­vide car­bon-neu­tral so­lu­tions to meet their cli­mate ob­jec­tives.</p>
    <p>“Our de­ci­sive ac­tion to­day will help Shell in Sin­ga­pore stay re­silient and build a cleaner, more sus­tain­able fu­ture for all of us.”</p>
