    <p>Flood­ing in three Malaysian east coast states has wors­ened, with more than 21,000 peo­ple shel­ter­ing in flood re­lief cen­tres and parts of the East Coast Ex­press­way (ECE) closed to traf­fic, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>At least four flood-re­lated deaths have been re­ported in the an­nual mon­soon sea­son.</p>
    <p>The lat­est vic­tim was a 41-yearold man who died from elec­tro­cu­tion while wad­ing through waters in his house com­pound in Pa­hang.</p>
    <p>Mr Isyraf Muham­mad was be­lieved to have touched an iron pole of a garage in the flooded com­pound of the house.</p>
    <p>Based on daily up­dates re­leased by the Na­tional Disas­ter Com­mand Cen­tre yes­ter­day, Pa­hang state was the worst hit, with 20,575 vic­tims forced to be evac­u­ated to 241 re­lief cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple evac­u­ated in two other east coast states, Ke­lan­tan and Tereng­ganu, stood at 559 and 411, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The ECE is the main high­way link­ing Tereng­ganu and Pa­hang states to Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>High­way con­ces­sion­aire ANIH Bhd said on Face­book that a sec­tion of the ECE was tem­po­rar­ily closed to ve­hi­cles as flood­wa­ters had in­un­dated the four-lane road.</p>
    <p>Pa­hang, Tereng­ganu, Ke­lan­tan and eastern Jo­hor face the South China Sea, which is lashed by strong cur­rents and winds along with heavy rain dur­ing the mon­soon sea­son, which typ­i­cally starts in Novem­ber and lasts for about four months.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor re­ported 1,036 fam­i­lies housed at re­lief shel­ters on Tues­day evening.</p>
    <p>While this year’s rainy sea­son is worse than in pre­vi­ous years, it is a far cry from the flood­ing ex­pe­ri­enced in De­cem­ber 2014 to Jan­u­ary 2015, when more than 200,000 peo­ple were evac­u­ated, and dozens of homes in Tumpat, Ke­lan­tan, were swept away by rag­ing muddy flood­wa­ters.</p>
    <p>The weath­er­man has forecast con­tin­u­ous heavy rain across coastal ar­eas in the east coast states of the penin­sula and in the Bor­neo state of Sabah this week.</p>
    <p>“Most ar­eas in the west coast of the penin­sula, Sarawak and Sabah are ex­pected to ex­pe­ri­ence thun­der­storms and heavy rain along with strong winds, es­pe­cially in the evening un­til early night,” the Malaysian Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Depart­ment said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It added that this would lead to flash floods in low-ly­ing ar­eas.</p>
