    <p>With more peo­ple shop­ping on­line ow­ing to Covid-19, lo­cal re­tail brands could face a gloomier fu­ture, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent study.</p>
    <p>For ev­ery $100 spent on lo­cal brands, only $2 was trans­acted on­line, com­pared with the Sin­ga­pore re­tail av­er­age of $25 per $100.</p>
    <p>This is based on find­ings re­leased yes­ter­day by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) and pay­ments tech­nol­ogy com­pany Visa.</p>
    <p>A lo­cal brand is de­fined in the study as a brand started and owned by Sin­ga­pore­ans, and in­cludes fash­ion ap­parel, shoes, depart­ment stores, food and con­fec­tionery.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore re­tail av­er­age takes into ac­count lo­cal brands and for­eign brands here.</p>
    <p>The study ex­am­ined trans­ac­tional data from Visa’s VisaNet elec­tronic pay­ment net­work from Jan­uary to March, the ini­tial months of the Covid-19 out­break and be­fore the two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod that started in early April.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to STB and Visa, “the lack of an on­line pres­ence has left lo­cal brands in­creas­ingly vul­ner­a­ble to the ad­verse eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer spend­ing on lo­cal brands also fell 14 per cent in the first three months of the year com­pared with the same pe­riod a year ago.</p>
    <p>STB and Visa did not pro­vide a break­down of the i mpact of Covid-19 on for­eign brands.</p>
    <p>The fall in spend­ing on l ocal brands was due to the pan­demic, which re­sulted in a lack of for­eign vis­i­tors and a change in shop­ping pref­er­ences among lo­cals, they added.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal re­tail scene has seen a spurt i n on­line shop­ping amid Covid-19 and its re­lated re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>To­tal visits to e-com­merce plat­forms in Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the first half of the year grew by 23 per cent, a study by iPrice Group and Sim­i­larWeb found.</p>
    <p>Re­tail ob­servers said that the fall in con­sump­tion of lo­cal brands is not nec­es­sar­ily uni­form across all prod­ucts, and may not nec­es­sar­ily be linked to the on­line pres­ence of a brand.</p>
    <p>Mr R. Dhi­nakaran, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion, said: “This fall in con­sump­tion does not ap­ply across all brands and prod­ucts. Some es­tab­lished brands are still able to do well.</p>
    <p>In an ef­fort to re­vive the lo­cal tourism in­dus­try, STB has signed part­ner­ships with both Visa and Mastercard to use an­a­lyt­ics to boost sales.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore closed its bor­ders to tourists on March 23.</p>
    <p>Since then, agree­ments with sev­eral coun­tries – such as China and Ja­pan – have been made to grad­u­ally re­sume cross-bor­der travel, but with re­stric­tions in place.</p>
