    <p>A number of the re­cent cases of Covid-19 among for­eign work­ers here are those who had pre­vi­ously been in the dor­mi­to­ries but were later placed in quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties af­ter they were ex­posed to oth­ers who were in­fected.</p>
    <p>They were moved to the fa­cil­i­ties be­fore the dor­mi­to­ries had been cleared, the Min­istry of Health’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said yes­ter­day when asked where the for­eign work­ers among re­cent Covid-19 cases had been in­fected.</p>
    <p>These cases are be­ing picked up now be­cause the work­ers are reach­ing the end of their quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods and are be­ing tested, he added.</p>
    <p>For these cases, ev­i­dence and testing sug­gest that many of them have older in­fec­tions that oc­curred be­fore they were even placed in the quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak.</p>
    <p>He said: “We have been look­ing very care­fully also to make sure that we are able to pick up any pos­si­ble re-in­fec­tions of cases that may have oc­curred from re­cov­ered cases be­fore. To date, we have not picked up any such case.”</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently about 14,000 mi­grant work­ers in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Other for­eign worker Covid-19 cases are picked up from the rou­tine testing that is in place for those who are re­turn­ing to work, he said.</p>
    <p>The task force is con­tin­u­ing to look at testing work­ers out­side of the dor­mi­tory set­ting, such as those who were de­canted to other fa­cil­i­ties early on while the au­thor­i­ties were man­ag­ing the coro­n­avirus out­break within the dor­mi­to­ries, said Prof Mak.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said those in quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties had been ex­posed to Covid-19-pos­i­tive pa­tients and so had a high risk of be­com­ing pa­tients them­selves.</p>
    <p>“We are still in the process of clear­ing these quar­an­tined work­ers. Over time, this number will come down,” he said.</p>
    <p>But in time, there will be new in­fec­tions, and more mi­grant work­ers who are ex­posed and have to be quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>Hence, the number of such quar­an­tined work­ers will stay at a cer­tain level, and a number of them will be ex­pected to be Covid-19pos­i­tive, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that as all the dor­mi­to­ries have been cleared, most of the work­ers will be go­ing back to work or have al­ready done so.</p>
    <p>As there will be more mi­grant work­ers in the work­places and more work­place in­ter­ac­tions, the number of Covid-19 cases in these set­tings is ex­pected to go up, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, it is very im­por­tant for us to re-em­pha­sise the safe man­age­ment and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures at work­places so as to re­duce the risk of trans­mis­sion in work­places,” he said.</p>
    <p>ON THE LOOK­OUT FOR RE-IN­FEC­TIONS</p>
    <p>We have been look­ing very care­fully also to make sure that we are able to pick up any pos­si­ble re-in­fec­tions of cases that may have oc­curred from re­cov­ered cases be­fore. To date, we have not picked up any such case.</p>
