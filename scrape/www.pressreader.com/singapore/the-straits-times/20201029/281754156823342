    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ac­knowl­edged on Tues­day that a coro­n­avirus eco­nomic re­lief deal would likely come af­ter the Nov 3 elec­tion, with the White House un­able to bridge dif­fer­ences with fel­low Repub­li­cans in the US Se­nate, as well as con­gres­sional Democrats.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the elec­tion, we’ll get the best stim­u­lus pack­age you’ve ever seen,” Mr Trump told re­porters at the White House, be­fore leav­ing on a cam­paign trip.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Speaker Nancy Pelosi have traded blame for the im­passe over another large stim­u­lus pack­age worth around US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion) to help Amer­i­cans weather the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We’ll al­ways talk about it be­cause our peo­ple should get it, the stim­u­lus, but Nancy Pelosi is only in­ter­ested in bail­ing out badly run, crime-rid­den Demo­crat cities and states,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi, in turn, pointed to the as­ser­tion by Mr Trump’s chief of staff Mark Mead­ows on Sun­day that the ad­min­is­tra­tion was not go­ing to con­trol the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The White House and (Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader) Mitch McCon­nell have re­sisted, and on Sun­day, Mark Mead­ows told us why,” she said, in a let­ter to Demo­cratic House mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent’s words only have mean­ing if he can get Mitch McCon­nell to take his hand off the pause but­ton,” Mrs Pelosi wrote.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi, the top elected Demo­crat, led the House to pass a US$3 tril­lion coro­n­avirus re­lief Bill in May, but Repub­li­cans who con­trol the Se­nate baulked at another large Bill.</p>
    <p>They pushed a much smaller mea­sure, which failed, then left Wash­ing­ton af­ter con­firm­ing Mr Trump’s nom­i­nee, Ms Amy Coney Bar­rett, to the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>The White House has said aid to state and lo­cal govern­ments has been the main stick­ing point in the talks, while Democrats also cited the lack of a na­tional coro­n­avirus test­ing plan.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions are surg­ing again in the US and 36 out of 50 states have seen an in­crease for at least two weeks in a row, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>Deaths have also more than dou­bled in seven states.</p>
    <p>Out­breaks in Mid­west­ern states have driven the most re­cent surge in virus cases.</p>
    <p>They are ris­ing in Michi­gan, Illi­nois and Iowa, but have lev­elled off or fallen in Nebraska, Wis­con­sin and Min­nesota.</p>
    <p>At a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, on Tues­day night, Mr Trump ac­knowl­edged that coro­n­avirus cases are ris­ing in the Mid­west but re­as­sured his sup­port­ers that “they will go down very quickly”.</p>
    <p>He ac­cused the news me­dia of hyp­ing the pan­demic in order to dam­age him po­lit­i­cally, and said, “you won’t be hear­ing that much” about it the day af­ter elec­tion day.</p>
