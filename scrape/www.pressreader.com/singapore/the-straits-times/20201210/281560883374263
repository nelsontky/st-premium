    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy will grow by 5.5 per cent next year, putting an end to the na­tion’s worst re­ces­sion ever, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey by the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS). The pace of growth can be even higher if suc­cess­ful vac­cine de­ploy­ment world­wide can ef­fec­tively con­tain the Covid-19 pan­demic, it said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy will grow by 5.5 per cent next year, putting an end to the na­tion’s worst re­ces­sion ever, ac­cord­ing to a cen­tral bank sur­vey of pro­fes­sional fore­cast­ers.</p>
    <p>The pace of growth can be even higher if suc­cess­ful vac­cine de­ploy­ment world­wide can ef­fec­tively con­tain the Covid-19 pan­demic, they said.</p>
    <p>In the quar­terly sur­vey by the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), 23 economists and an­a­lysts pre­dicted growth of 5 per cent to 5.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>The fore­cast comes af­ter the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) last month said growth will re­bound be­tween 4 per cent and 6 per cent next year – the most since 2011, when the econ­omy grew 6.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>This, how­ever, is com­ing off a par­tic­u­larly low base as MTI ex­pects the econ­omy to shrink 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Re­cent de­vel­op­ments have made economists more con­fi­dent that a re­cov­ery is un­der way. Al­most four in five of them felt that the top rea­son lift­ing the growth outlook in the com­ing year would be the con­tain­ment of the pan­demic, mainly be­cause vac­cines would be made avail­able across the globe.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the MAS sur­vey, an­a­lysts said other fac­tors that could im­pact Sin­ga­pore’s growth tra­jec­tory next year would in­clude the up­swing of the elec­tron­ics cy­cle and the pace of re­cov­ery in other re­gional economies such as Malaysia, In­done­sia and China.</p>
    <p>But the re­cov­ery will de­pend heav­ily on con­tain­ing Covid-19, both glob­ally and do­mes­ti­cally, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank se­nior econ­o­mist Irvin Seah said the emer­gence of sev­eral vac­cine can­di­dates and pro­jec­tions of higher-than-ex­pected pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity of these vac­cines have added op­ti­mism that the time­line for end­ing the pan­demic can be brought for­ward.</p>
    <p>“The more clar­ity we get on vac­ci­na­tion, the stronger the op­ti­mism would be,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a cer­tain de­gree of cau­tion is re­quired, given the vac­ci­na­tion process i n coun­tries with larger pop­u­la­tions and mea­gre re­sources. In­dia, for ex­am­ple, would be a lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenge and would re­quire more time than else­where.</p>
    <p>In the MAS sur­vey, the prospect of re­open­ing bor­ders to in­ter­na­tional travel was also seen as a po­ten­tial up­side.</p>
    <p>But Mr Seah said travel re­stric­tions will be among the last of the curbs to be lifted, and may not contribute much to next year’s eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, around seven in 10 re­spon­dents in the MAS sur­vey felt that the big­gest risk to growth was that the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion might de­te­ri­o­rate fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Around a quar­ter of the re­spon­dents saw wors­en­ing United States-China ten­sions as a down­side risk, com­pared with 60 per cent in the pre­vi­ous sur­vey.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank econ­o­mist Howie Lee said he will stick with his 2021 growth es­ti­mate of 5 per cent, which is at the lower end of the scale in the sur­vey.</p>
    <p>“We re­main cau­tious of down­side risks to both the global and Sin­ga­pore econ­omy un­til the vac­cine proves it­self heav­ily ef­fec­tive af­ter pub­lic dis­sem­i­na­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>For this year, fore­cast­ers in the MAS sur­vey ex­pect gross do­mes­tic prod­uct to de­cline by 6 per cent, un­changed from the pre­vi­ous sur­vey.</p>
    <p>They also ex­pect the un­em­ploy­ment rate to reach 3.7 per cent at the end of this year, up from their pre­vi­ous es­ti­mate of 3.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Three-quar­ters of the re­spon­dents ex­pect pri­vate res­i­den­tial prop­erty prices to pick up in the Oc­to­ber-to-De­cem­ber pe­riod com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, while the rest be­lieve prices will re­main sta­ble.</p>
