    <p>•</p>
    <p>FRANK­FURT The call came on a Sun­day even­ing, as Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci were catch­ing up with pa­per­work at their mod­est home near the Ger­man city of Mainz. It con­firmed that their – at times con­tro­ver­sial – lives’ work had pro­duced a break­through that could of­fer hu­man­ity a route out of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>A vac­cine can­di­date de­vel­oped by BioNTech, the com­pany they co-founded 12 years ago, was more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing the dis­ease – a far higher level than that of the widely used jabs for flu, shin­gles or ra­bies. It proved for the first time that the deadly virus could be van­quished by sci­ence.</p>
    <p>But even as they basked in the good news – the two tee­to­tallers cel­e­brated on Sun­day by brew­ing some black tea – nei­ther Dr Sahin nor his re­search part­ner and wife, Dr Tureci, can ex­plain pre­cisely why their pre­cious prod­uct – code-named BNT162b2 – works. That is very much by de­sign.</p>
    <p>The shot, which is be­ing tested in tri­als held by US pharma group Pfizer in­volv­ing more than 43,000 peo­ple across six coun­tries, is “an al­most per­fect vac­cine, in some re­spects”, Dr Sahin tells the Fi­nan­cial Times. It works by mar­shalling a num­ber of pathogen-fight­ing tools si­mul­ta­ne­ously, in the hope that one, or sev­eral, will de­feat Sars-CoV-2. But so far, they do not know which ones are ac­tu­ally suc­ceed­ing.</p>
    <p>“We have yet to un­der­stand – and this will come in the next six to 12 months – what drives the pro­tec­tion rate,” ex­plains</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin, who is also BioNTech’s chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>Un­like the vac­cines that have al­most erad­i­cated dis­eases such as measles and po­lio, the novel plat­form on which BioNTech’s vac­cine is based, known as mes­sen­ger RNA, or mRNA, does not use a weak­ened or in­ac­ti­vated virus to trig­ger an im­mune re­sponse. In­stead, it in­jects ge­netic in­struc­tions into the body – a method that has never be­fore been used in a li­censed phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and has faced scep­ti­cism from the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity for decades.</p>
    <p>But the coro­n­avirus cri­sis gave Dr Sahin and Dr Tureci an op­por­tu­nity to prove that one of the tech­nol­ogy’s key char­ac­ter­is­tics – the abil­ity to rapidly de­ploy the im­mune sys­tem’s dis­parate forces against a pre­cise tar­get – could her­ald the rev­o­lu­tion that they have been fore­cast­ing for 25 years.</p>
    <p>“It was a for­tu­nate co­in­ci­dence that we were in a po­si­tion to fight this dis­ease,” says Dr Tureci, who is also BioNTech’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“We had a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence with RNA in the con­text of man­u­fac­tur­ing it for in­di­vid­u­alised cancer vac­cines,” she says, a process which BioNTech only re­cently man­aged to make sta­ble enough for high-qual­ity pro­duc­tion. “If the pandemic were to have hap­pened three years ago, it would have been much more dif­fi­cult.”</p>
    <p>Un­like the vac­cines that have al­most erad­i­cated dis­eases such as measles and po­lio, the novel plat­form on which BioNTech’s vac­cine is based, known as mes­sen­ger RNA, or mRNA, does not use a weak­ened or in­ac­ti­vated virus to trig­ger an im­mune re­sponse. In­stead, it in­jects ge­netic in­struc­tions into the body – a method that has never be­fore been used in a li­censed phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and has faced scep­ti­cism from the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity for decades.</p>
    <p>‘IM­MUNE SYS­TEM WHISPERERS’</p>
    <p>For BioNTech, the tim­ing of Sars-CoV-2’s ar­rival is just one of sev­eral serendip­i­tous events that led to the com­pany’s un­likely suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin and Dr Tureci, both born in the 1960s to Turk­ish par­ents who made their way to Ger­many after the West Ger­man gov­ern­ment signed an im­mi­gra­tion agree­ment with Ankara in or­der to boost its di­lap­i­dated post-war labour force, grew up within 240km of each other, and pur­sued re­mark­ably sim­i­lar paths that would even­tu­ally con­verge.</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin’s fa­ther worked at a Ford car fac­tory in Cologne. From the age of 11, he re­mem­bers be­ing struck by the “in­cred­i­bly beau­ti­ful and com­plex” im­mune sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t have Google,” the 55-year-old re­calls. “Ev­ery time we went into town, I went to the book­store.” He adds: “I also had a good re­la­tion­ship with the lo­cal li­brar­ian, who or­dered new (sci­ence and maths) books for me and set them aside for when I came in.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tureci’s fa­ther, a sur­geon who had a keen in­ter­est in tech­nol­ogy and sci­ence, played a more di­rect role in her med­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>From a young age, she would fol­low him as he did his rounds through the wards of his hospi­tal in Lower Sax­ony, and even into the op­er­at­ing the­atre. “I watched my first ap­pen­dec­tomy at the age of six,” she says.</p>
    <p>At sep­a­rate uni­ver­si­ties, they took al­most iden­ti­cal routes, com­bin­ing a med­i­cal de­gree with a doc­tor­ate pro­gramme: Dr Tureci’s in molec­u­lar bi­ol­ogy, Dr Sahin’s in im­munother­apy. They met in the early 1990s: She was on ro­ta­tion at a ward deal­ing with blood can­cers at a hospi­tal in Saar­land, where he was a ju­nior res­i­dent and her su­per­vi­sor. Early dates were spent dis­cussing pre-clin­i­cal in­no­va­tions – the re­served Dr Sahin was al­ready able to quote re­sults from sci­en­tific pa­pers by rote – and a shared goal to cre­ate cancer ther­a­pies. Even on their wed­ding day, the duo made time for lab work.</p>
    <p>“We found that our aca­demic fields were com­ple­men­tary,” Dr Tureci says, be­fore adding, with a wry smile: “So we mar­ried them, and each other.”</p>
    <p>After she aban­doned her physi­cian train­ing to ded­i­cate her­self to re­search, the cou­ple, whose pre­oc­cu­pa­tion Dr Tureci now hu­mor­ously de­scribes as “im­mune sys­tem whisperers”, set about try­ing to find a unique tool to find and fight anti­gens on car­cino­genic tu­mours.</p>
    <p>Meth­ods such as vi­ral vec­tors, or re­com­bi­nant pro­teins, “came with lim­i­ta­tions”, says Dr Sahin, un­til, in the mid-1990s, the cou­ple heard about the niche plat­form known as mRNA.</p>
    <p>As well as be­ing a “non-in­fec­tious plat­form”, mean­ing there is no risk of con­tract­ing the dis­ease for which one is be­ing in­oc­u­lated, mRNA vac­cines pro­vided “a way to let the pa­tient pro­duce his or her own drug”, by sim­ply send­ing in­struc­tions that can be read by cel­lu­lar ma­chin­ery, says im­muno-on­col­ogy pi­o­neer Christoph Hu­ber, who helped found both BioNTech and Ganymed, Dr Sahin and Dr Tureci’s first com­pany set up in 2002.</p>
    <p>PROV­ING THE SCI­ENCE</p>
    <p>None­the­less, the wider sci­en­tific world was largely dis­mis­sive of the tech­nol­ogy, es­pe­cially after early ex­per­i­ments with mRNA ther­a­pies showed that the body treated them as an in­truder, and pre­vented it from reach­ing the in­tended cells.</p>
    <p>“It was a small com­mu­nity, and even within the small com­mu­nity, we were ig­nor­ing each other,” says Dr Sahin of the hand­ful of re­searchers who were de­voted to mRNA, and who are now hotly tipped for a No­bel Prize.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal mar­kets, and large phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies, were also un­con­vinced, lead­ing them to fo­cus in­stead on an­ti­body ther­a­pies at Ganymed, which was sold for roughly US$1.4 bil­lion (S$1.9 bil­lion) in 2016.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, Dr Sahin brought a small team of sci­en­tists and col­lab­o­ra­tors with him to the Univer­sity of Mainz which, along with Tub­in­gen, 160km to its south, was home to a clus­ter of cut­ting-edge mRNA ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>That group re­mains at the core of BioNTech, and their ex­pe­ri­ence with the ag­ile man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses needed to make mRNA vac­cines on an in­di­vid­ual pa­tient ba­sis would prove in­valu­able at the start of the year.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, Dr Sahin, whose ad­dic­tion to sci­en­tific jour­nals is gen­tly mocked by friends and col­leagues, read an ar­ti­cle in the Lancet about a new coro­n­avirus that had emerged in China’s Hubei prov­ince.</p>
    <p>He quickly con­vinced both Dr Tureci and the rest of BioNTech’s board that the ev­i­dence pointed to a pathogen that had the po­ten­tial to spread much faster than even the au­thors of the re­port re­alised.</p>
    <p>Just two weeks after the ge­netic se­quence of Sars-CoV-2 was made pub­lic on Jan 12, BioNTech be­gan its Covid-19 vac­cine pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>By the time the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion de­clared a global pandemic in early March, the com­pany had 20 mRNA can­di­dates in de­vel­op­ment. Days later, it had signed deals with Pfizer and China’s Fo­sun to help the com­pany – which had roughly 1,300 em­ploy­ees – with clin­i­cal tri­als and mass pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the FT in March, Dr Sahin said that with the “good­will” of reg­u­la­tors, an ap­proved prod­uct could be avail­able by the end of the year, al­though he warned this would be “push­ing the lim­its of what is pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the cou­ple’s quiet con­fi­dence that a vac­cine could be de­liv­ered within a year was a dis­cov­ery made dur­ing the Sars out­break in 2003, which re­vealed the ex­is­tence of “spike” pro­teins on viruses that bind to a re­cep­tor com­monly found in lung cells, in which an mRNA vac­cine can ac­ti­vate a re­sponse that brings an­ti­bod­ies to the fight.</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, those an­ti­bod­ies will bind to the spike pro­tein – which is par­tic­u­larly strong in Sars-CoV-2 – to pre­vent it from dock­ing, while si­mul­ta­ne­ously call­ing on cells to phago­cy­tise, or con­sume, the virus.</p>
    <p>DE­FEN­SIVE WALLS</p>
    <p>As the com­pany stepped up its Project Light­speed, and tested its vac­cines on mice, rats and mon­keys, pre-clin­i­cal data was strong enough to con­vince Ger­many’s med­i­cal reg­u­la­tor, the Paul-Ehrlich-In­sti­tut, to al­low clin­i­cal tri­als in April. BioNTech whit­tled down its can­di­dates to four. Pub­lic in­ter­est was im­me­di­ately strong – more than 1,000 vol­un­teers con­tacted the trial co­or­di­na­tors in a sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>Res­pi­ra­tory viruses, how­ever, are no­to­ri­ously dif­fi­cult to tackle, as the pathogen can reach the lungs via the nose or mouth very quickly. If a per­son is ex­posed to a high load of the virus, and the an­ti­bod­ies aren’t fast enough, the coro­n­avirus en­ters the cells’ in­te­rior and pro­lif­er­ates there, cre­at­ing mil­lions of copies.</p>
    <p>To fight this, BioNTech en­gi­neered its mRNA vac­cine to ac­ti­vate a sec­ond line of de­fence, known as T-cells.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine pro­duces two kinds of T-cell. The first is known as CD8, and is equipped with scan­ning mol­e­cules that can look into and kill in­fected cells if it en­coun­ters any virus, while also re­duc­ing the re­pro­duc­tion of the pathogen.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond is CD4 cells, known as or­ches­tra­tors, which make sure an­ti­bod­ies are di­rected against the right part of the virus and bind very strongly. They also help CD8 work, call­ing on many other parts of the im­mune sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“You can switch on, via a snow­ball ef­fect, an en­tire cas­cade of im­mune mech­a­nisms which you can lever­age,” says Dr Tureci.</p>
    <p>But much about how this would work when tested on hu­mans was un­known un­til last week.</p>
    <p>After elim­i­nat­ing three of the vac­cine can­di­dates – one of them led to 75 per cent of pa­tients get­ting a fever – BioNTech and Pfizer launched a large-scale, fi­nal phase trial in late July, which was ex­panded be­yond the United States and Ger­many to Brazil, Ar­gentina, South Africa and Turkey, as the coro­n­avirus sub­sided in some parts of the world over the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Roughly half of trial par­tic­i­pants were given a placebo, and ap­prox­i­mately 21,000 were given two shots, three weeks apart, while Dr Sahin and Dr Tureci waited for the req­ui­site 62 vol­un­teers to con­tract Covid-19, in or­der for in­de­pen­dent ob­servers to be able to cal­cu­late the over­all rate of ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>That thresh­old was passed soon after the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3, and news of the ex­ter­nal com­mit­tees find­ing that the vac­cine was 90 per cent ef­fec­tive came days later.</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin, who was ex­pect­ing about 80 per cent ef­fec­tive­ness and had bus­ied him­self in work while wait­ing for the re­sults, heard the news from Pfizer chief ex­ec­u­tive Al­bert Bourla.</p>
    <p>“Al­bert called me and said ‘do you want to know the data?’ – and I said ‘no’!” he says. “It was a fan­tas­tic re­lief. There was a lot of in­di­ca­tion that there was im­mu­nity, but no defini­tive proof.”</p>
    <p>But the global re­ac­tion was greater – and more po­lit­i­cally charged – than any­one at BioNTech ex­pected.</p>
    <p>‘FO­CUS ON THE FACTS’</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin and Dr Tureci, who do not own a tele­vi­sion set and shun so­cial me­dia, have been hailed as an im­mi­grant suc­cess story, and their com­pany, which has be­come more valu­able than Deutsche Bank, as an ex­am­ple of the power of pri­vate cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Snip­pets of such cov­er­age were e-mailed to the cou­ple by friends and col­leagues, much to the ex­as­per­a­tion of Dr Sahin, who has made a point of keep­ing his dis­tance from the pol­i­tics of the pandemic re­sponse, let­ting Pfizer’s Mr Bourla deal with the at­tempts to in­flu­ence the process by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Of course there are peo­ple with mi­grant back­grounds who are en­cour­aged by our story,” says Dr Sahin, who is frus­trated by how their back­ground is now be­ing used in the de­bate on the con­tri­bu­tions of im­mi­grants and their chil­dren. “You can use us as an ar­gu­ment for mi­gra­tion, and if some­thing is not op­ti­mal, you can use it against mi­gra­tion,” he adds. “We should just fo­cus on the facts.”</p>
    <p>The fi­nal suc­cess of BioNTech’s can­di­date, which must still pass safety checks by Amer­i­can and Euro­pean Union reg­u­la­tors, was due to a tech­nol­ogy called nu­cle­o­side-mod­i­fied mRNA and which was pi­o­neered by an im­mi­grant to the US – Hun­gar­ian sci­en­tist Katalin Kariko.</p>
    <p>An early believer in mRNA vac­cine de­sign, she was over­looked by scep­ti­cal su­pe­ri­ors at the Univer­sity of Penn­syl­va­nia who saw no prom­ise in her re­search, and when re­cruited by Dr Sahin to join the Mainz-based com­pany in 2013, she was ridiculed by some in her own de­part­ment. One for­mer col­league “laughed at me”, she re­calls. “He said: ‘The com­pany doesn’t even have a web­site!’”</p>
    <p>Dr Kariko, how­ever, is not rel­ish­ing her new­found fame. “I can han­dle the re­jec­tion,” she says, “but the lime­light is ter­ri­fy­ing.”</p>
    <p>‘EX­TREME PUSH’</p>
    <p>While still op­er­at­ing with fewer than 2,000 em­ploy­ees, BioNTech – which re­ceived €375 mil­lion (S$598 mil­lion) from the Ger­man gov­ern­ment in Septem­ber – is also on its way to be­com­ing a house­hold name.</p>
    <p>Most of the 1.35 bil­lion doses of the Covid-19 vac­cine that it plans to man­u­fac­ture with Pfizer by the end of next year are al­ready ear­marked for the US, EU, Bri­tain and Ja­pan. Sev­eral other coun­tries, in­clud­ing Brazil and Switzer­land, are scram­bling to se­cure any re­main­ing sup­ply.</p>
    <p>But pub­lic health of­fi­cials have urged cau­tion, point­ing out that it re­mains to be seen how dif­fer­ent age groups or risk cat­e­gories will re­act to the vac­cine, or in­deed if those im­mu­nised will still be ca­pa­ble of pass­ing on the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“The maths tells us that if we have such strong dis­ease preven­tion, this would lead to a cer­tain per­cent­age of in­fec­tion preven­tion,” Dr Sahin says, though he pre­dicts this would be “likely lower” than 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>Dr Tureci also warns against com­pla­cency in the months un­til the vac­cine can be rolled out glob­ally – a chal­lenge that will be ini­tially com­pli­cated by the need to keep BNT162b2 at roughly mi­nus 75 deg C dur­ing trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing the words with which US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den greeted the vac­cine news, “we have to con­tinue to wear our masks and do the so­cial dis­tanc­ing”, the 53-year-old says.</p>
    <p>But the cou­ple be­lieve their suc­cess – which top US in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist An­thony Fauci told re­porters “val­i­dates the mRNA plat­form” – could prove even more con­se­quen­tial than stem­ming a pandemic that has killed 1.3 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing made a multi­bil­lion­aire by last week’s news, Dr Sahin plans to con­tinue work­ing on mRNA vac­cines tar­get­ing prostate, ovar­ian, pan­cre­atic and other can­cers. He hopes that as with the dis­cov­ery of gene-edit­ing tool Crispr, “there will be an ex­treme push for the tech­nol­ogy”.</p>
    <p>On the back of a wealth of new mRNA safety data and in­creased in­vest­ment, the duo could be just a few years away from real­is­ing the dream they had back in 1991 – of de­vel­op­ing in­di­vid­u­alised cancer ther­a­pies.</p>
    <p>Their ef­forts, cen­tred in a city that for cen­turies was most fa­mous as the birth­place of the print­ing rev­o­lu­tion, will now be met with “less scep­ti­cism”, Dr Tureci says, be­tray­ing the small­est hint of tri­umphal­ism.</p>
    <p>“We still be­lieve it could rev­o­lu­tionise the en­tire in­dus­try.”</p>
