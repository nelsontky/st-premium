    <p>If there’s any­thing more pre­cious than your smart­phone, it must be the pic­tures in it.</p>
    <p>You can buy a new phone but not the photos and the memories. So, it is im­per­a­tive to per­form reg­u­lar back­ups. Here are some tips to help you do that.</p>
    <p>Cloud stor­age GOOGLE PHOTOS</p>
    <p>An­droid phone users can try the Google Photos app, na­tive to the An­droid plat­form, to au­to­mat­i­cally back up photos when­ever you are con­nected to the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>You just need to en­able the backup and sync func­tion in the app. Just click on the Google ac­count icon on the top right corner of the app.</p>
    <p>You have two op­tions – orig­i­nal and high qual­ity. The lat­ter is cur­rently free but Google will “op­ti­mise” or com­press the up­loaded photos.</p>
    <p>From June 1 next year, any new high-qual­ity photos up­loaded will count to­wards the 15GB free stor­age that comes with ev­ery Google ac­count. So you may need to pay for more cloud stor­age (from $2.79 a month for 100GB).</p>
    <p>ICLOUD PHOTOS</p>
    <p>iCloud Photos is the way to go for Ap­ple iPhone users. It au­to­mat­i­cally backs up your photos from the mo­ment you take them.</p>
    <p>It also makes the photos avail­able on your other Ap­ple de­vices, such as your Mac or Ap­ple TV, as long as they are signed in to the same iCloud ac­count and con­nected to the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>To ac­ti­vate this feature, go to Set­tings on your iPhone, select Photos and then en­able iCloud Photos.</p>
    <p>The high-res­o­lu­tion orig­i­nal photos will be up­loaded by de­fault and stored in iCloud while a “light­weight” ver­sion re­mains on your iPhone to free up stor­age space.</p>
    <p>But Ap­ple pro­vides only a mea­gre 5GB of iCloud stor­age free. You need to pay $1.28 a month for 50GB, or $3.98 for 200GB of iCloud stor­age.</p>
    <p>DROPBOX</p>
    <p>If you don’t want to be on Google or Ap­ple cloud stor­age, there is the Dropbox app. It works on all plat­forms – from desk­tops to mo­bile de­vices.</p>
    <p>To en­able the cam­era up­load feature in Dropbox, tap on the top left-hand corner of the app to get a drop­down menu. Select Photos and in the next screen, tap on Turn on cam­era up­loads. But only 2GB of space is free. And the next tier is 2TB of cloud stor­age at US$9.99 (S$13.92) a month.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal stor­age BACK UP ON YOUR COM­PUTER</p>
    <p>You can trans­fer the photos to your com­puter man­u­ally. This re­quires more ef­fort but it gives you more con­trol.</p>
    <p>And it is free, with no monthly sub­scrip­tion, though you may have to buy ex­ter­nal drives for more stor­age space.</p>
    <p>For Win­dows users, plug your An­droid phone to your com­puter with the ca­ble and it will ap­pear as a dig­i­tal cam­era. Click on it, and you will find a DCIM folder. Drag this folder to your com­puter or an ex­ter­nal drive to store the photos.</p>
    <p>If you are us­ing an iPhone, make sure you do not in­stall iTunes or you might run into some is­sues like con­nec­tion drops.</p>
    <p>But macOS users can opt to back up the en­tire con­tents of their iPhone in­clud­ing photos and set­tings. Once con­nected to your Mac com­puter, the iPhone will ap­pear on the Finder. Click on it and select Back Up now. You need to make sure your ma­chine has enough stor­age space.</p>
    <p>If you are us­ing an An­droid smart­phone, you need to down­load and use the free An­droid File Trans­fer app on your Mac to move the photos to your com­puter.</p>
    <p>Once the An­droid phone is con­nected to your Mac (re­mem­ber to grant the per­mis­sions for me­dia trans­fer on your phone), you will see a bunch of fold­ers on the app. Look for the DCIM and Pic­tures fold­ers. Drag and drop the fold­ers (or select photos inside) to your Mac ma­chine.</p>
    <p>BACK UP ON AN EX­TER­NAL DE­VICE</p>
    <p>A nifty de­vice called Photo­fast Pho­toCube C ($99) – which is es­sen­tially a mi­croSD card reader – sup­ports up to 2TB.</p>
    <p>It au­to­mat­i­cally backs up your photos us­ing its Photo­fast One app (avail­able on An­droid and iOS).</p>
    <p>It comes with a USB-C port and a USB-C con­nec­tor for plug­ging into your phone. Once con­nected, the app will au­to­mat­i­cally back up your photos, con­tacts and cal­en­dar while your phone is be­ing charged. You can do this be­fore you go to bed ev­ery night.</p>
