    <p>The of­fi­cial recog­ni­tion, grat­i­tude and fi­nan­cial in­cen­tives that front­line med­i­cal staff get from an ap­pre­cia­tive Gov­ern­ment, to­gether with the warm sup­port from al­most ev­ery­one in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety, make our fight against the coro­n­avirus that much more mean­ing­ful and con­se­quen­tial.</p>
    <p>We have been lauded, we have not been dis­crim­i­nated against and we know we are not in it alone (S’pore will emerge more united from shared or­deal: PM Lee, Aug 10).</p>
    <p>While some med­i­cal staff in other coun­tries saw their fight as fruit­less and fraught with dan­ger at ev­ery turn be­cause of ad­min­is­tra­tive over­sights and ne­glect, and oth­ers felt aban­doned in their ex­haust­ing en­deav­ours as lo­gis­ti­cal sup­port was al­ways de­fi­cient, with the au­thor­i­ties mak­ing light of the pan­demic, this has never been the case here.</p>
    <p>The scope and mag­ni­tude of the prob­lem were never sup­pressed, the national ef­fort was al­ways in high gear with pedal pressed to the metal, and there were reg­u­lar tweaks and im­prove­ments to the ap­proach.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus con­tin­ues to con­found coun­tries in the ways it can per­pet­u­ate it­self. The only dead cer­tain fact is that new waves will strike us the minute the virus de­tects a chink in the national ar­moury.</p>
    <p>And it would be naive national pol­icy to pos­tu­late that a vac­cine, it­self fraught with un­known peril and un­de­ter­mined ef­fi­cacy against mu­tated vi­ral strains, would prove a panacea.</p>
    <p>We are barely into our sixth month, and al­ready fa­tigue is mak­ing its way into a Sin­ga­porean so­ci­ety clam­our­ing for more re­lax­ation of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But how we han­dle the changes de­manded by the com­plex­ity of the prob­lem, based on the evolv­ing med­i­cal and so­ci­etal sce­nar­ios, will see us ei­ther grasp or lose the op­por­tu­nity to win the fu­ture. Yik Keng Yeong (Dr)</p>
