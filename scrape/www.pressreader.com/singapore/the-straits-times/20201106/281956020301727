    <p>I thank Dr Yik Keng Yeong for shar­ing his ex­pe­ri­ence and views that not all em­ploy­ers treat their for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers (FDWs) badly (Don’t gen­er­alise about treat­ment based on black sheep, Nov 2).</p>
    <p>Many do treat them as part of the fam­ily, din­ing out in restau­rants and cel­e­brat­ing spe­cial oc­ca­sions to­gether.</p>
    <p>Some of my friends have done won­der­ful things for their FDWs, in­clud­ing help­ing them to save money and set up small busi­nesses or buy land in their home towns. Some have even vis­ited their maids’ fam­i­lies in their home coun­tries.</p>
    <p>As part of the judg­ing panel for the FDW and Em­ployer of the Year Award 2020 or­gan­ised by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Em­ploy­ment Agen­cies Sin­ga­pore in Jan­uary, I heard sto­ries of ex­tra­or­di­nary kind­ness from both em­ploy­ers and FDWs.</p>
    <p>One em­ployer paid for her helper’s eye oper­a­tion and cared for her while she was un­able to see dur­ing her re­cov­ery pe­riod.</p>
    <p>An­other em­ployer helped with the med­i­cal ex­penses when her maid’s mother suf­fered a ma­jor stroke, and paid for the maid’s flight home to see her mother. When the mother died, the em­ployer com­forted and cared for the maid.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, we worked with for­eign worker ad­vo­cacy groups Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics and Maid For More to pro­duce a video to help Sin­ga­pore­ans see life from the per­spec­tive of their helpers.</p>
    <p>These sto­ries strengthen my be­lief that not all em­ploy­ers ex­ploit their FDWs.</p>
    <p>There were an es­ti­mated 255,800 FDWs in Sin­ga­pore as at June last year, which works out to about one in five Sin­ga­porean house­holds em­ploy­ing a maid.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that news re­ports of FDW abuse, while hor­rific, rep­re­sent a mi­nor­ity.</p>
    <p>Let’s re­mem­ber to treat FDWs with em­pa­thy and be more un­der­stand­ing of their per­sonal sit­u­a­tions. Give them enough rest and time to talk to their fam­ily and friends, whether on days off or on the phone.</p>
    <p>When we treat our FDWs with gen­uine kind­ness and re­spect, they will re­cip­ro­cate in kind, with loy­alty and trust­wor­thi­ness and be­ing happy at work.</p>
