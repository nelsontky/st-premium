    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day ac­knowl­edged the grow­ing anx­i­ety over com­pe­ti­tion for jobs from for­eign­ers, and said the Govern­ment will ad­dress th­ese con­cerns.</p>
    <p>As masters of their own land, Sin­ga­pore­ans must have con­fi­dence in the rights and priv­i­leges of cit­i­zen­ship, she said, adding that their in­ter­ests are “al­ways para­mount” in all that the Govern­ment does.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, Sin­ga­pore can­not af­ford to turn in­wards, away from the world, and should con­tinue to wel­come those who can con­trib­ute and im­prove the coun­try’s fu­ture, she added.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the is­sue of work pass hold­ers, which has be­come more emo­tive amid the eco­nomic down­turn caused by the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, she said: “This has be­come a ma­jor source of anx­i­ety, es­pe­cially among mid-ca­reer Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand th­ese con­cerns. They not only touch on mat­ters of liveli­hood, but also on our sense of iden­tity and be­long­ing. They will be ad­dressed.”</p>
    <p>In her tra­di­tional ad­dress to open Par­lia­ment, which was drafted by the Govern­ment, she said the au­thor­i­ties will work with em­ploy­ers to build up the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of the work­force, and to en­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans are treated fairly when com­pa­nies recruit or re­trench work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Our strong ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem and train­ing path­ways have pro­duced a work­force that can com­pete against the best in the world,” she said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy con­tracted 6.7 per cent in the first half of this year as the Covid-19 cri­sis deep­ened, and un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ments surged be­tween April and June.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to keep their hearts open to those who come from be­yond the coun­try’s shores, the Pres­i­dent said: “We should con­tinue to wel­come and in­te­grate those who can con­trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore, and im­prove our lives and our chil­dren’s fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>She ac­knowl­edged that the is­sue can be po­lar­is­ing, and urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to lis­ten and to try to un­der­stand one another as more mean­ing­ful dis­cus­sions are opened up on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>She also said it was im­por­tant to break out of on­line echo cham­bers to try and bridge the gap with those who think dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>“We must strive to ob­tain greater in­sight, build shared un­der­stand­ing and use our di­verse per­spec­tives and ideas to achieve bet­ter out­comes for all,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean iden­tity, she added, has been formed and strength­ened “not by ex­clud­ing those who ar­rive later, but by suc­ces­sive ar­rivals adding to the rich­ness of our so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>ANX­I­ETY AMONG MID-CA­REER SIN­GA­PORE­ANS</p>
    <p>We un­der­stand th­ese con­cerns. They not only touch on mat­ters of liveli­hood, but also on our sense of iden­tity and be­long­ing. They will be ad­dressed.</p>
