    <p>Well-known Sin­ga­pore karaoke chain Teo Heng may close up to half of its 14 out­lets here. Its out­lets at Ka­tong Shop­ping Cen­tre and Sem­bawang Shop­ping Cen­tre are al­ready shut. Teo Heng KTV founder Jack­son Teo (be­low) says this pe­riod has been “very bad” for his busi­ness since en­ter­tain­ment venues such as bars and karaoke out­lets were or­dered to close in late March.</p>
    <p>Some have said the coro­n­avirus is the great equaliser be­cause it can hit any­one – in­clud­ing the rich, pow­er­ful and fa­mous.</p>
    <p>It has claimed the lives of celebri­ties such as Amer­i­can mu­si­cian John Prine and Broad­way ac­tor Nick Cordero.</p>
    <p>From Bol­ly­wood icon Amitabh Bachchan and Hol­ly­wood stal­wart Tom Hanks to opera stars An­drea Bo­celli and Placido Domingo, here are celebri­ties who have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>1 Amitabh, Ab­hishek and Aish­warya Rai Bachchan</p>
    <p>Bol­ly­wood was rocked when In­dian film icon Amitabh Bachchan (left), his son Ab­hishek, daugh­ter-in-law Aish­warya Rai Bachchan and grand­daugh­ter Aarad­hya (all above) tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus. His wife, Jaya, tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Amitabh and his 44-year-old ac­tor son were hos­pi­talised on July 11, while ac­tress Aish­warya Rai, 46, and her eight-year-old daugh­ter Aarad­hya were ad­mit­ted on July 17 af­ter ini­tially be­ing un­der home quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Amitabh, 77, has been tweet­ing to his fans, thank­ing them for their prayers: “In happy times, in times of ill­ness, you, our near and dear, our well wish­ers, our fans have ever given us un­stint­ing love, af­fec­tion, care and prayer.”</p>
    <p>2 Tom Hanks</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood nice guy Tom Hanks was one of the first ma­jor stars in­fected by the coro­n­avirus to go pub­lic.</p>
    <p>In early March, he tweeted that he and his 63-year-old wife, ac­tress and singer Rita Wil­son, had tested pos­i­tive while in Aus­tralia, where he was film­ing an Elvis Pres­ley biopic. Both have re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Hanks, 64, re­cently de­scribed his ex­pe­ri­ence to Bri­tish news­pa­per The Guardian: “I just had crip­pling body aches, I was very fa­tigued all the time and I couldn’t con­cen­trate on any­thing for more than about 12 min­utes.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor has since be­come a strong ad­vo­cate for mea­sures such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing, mask wear­ing and reg­u­lar hand wash­ing.</p>
    <p>3 Idris Elba</p>
    <p>Bri­tish ac­tor Idris Elba, best known for roles in tele­vi­sion se­ries The Wire (2002 to 2008) and films such as Marvel’s Thor tril­ogy (2011 to 2017), an­nounced in March that he and his wife, Amer­i­can ac­tress and model Sabrina Dhowre, had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>They have re­cov­ered and Elba, 47, re­cently told Bri­tish mag­a­zine Ra­dio Times he feels “lucky to be alive”.</p>
    <p>The episode af­fected his men­tal health, though. “Men­tally, it hit me very badly, be­cause a lot was un­known about it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I felt very com­pelled to speak about it, just be­cause it was such an un­known. So the men­tal im­pact of that on both my­self and my wife was pretty trau­matic.”</p>
    <p>4 Daniel Dae Kim</p>
    <p>South Korean-born Amer­i­can ac­tor Daniel Dae Kim took to Instagram to dis­close he had the coro­n­avirus in March.</p>
    <p>The 51-year-old, best known for tele­vi­sion shows such as Lost (2004 to 2010) and Hawaii Five-O (2010 to 2020), re­cov­ered that same month.</p>
    <p>He then auc­tioned off au­to­graphed Hawaii Five-O scripts to raise funds for hos­pi­tals in Hawaii and other parts of the United States.</p>
    <p>He has also spo­ken out against the rise in racism to­wards AsianAmer­i­cans dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>5 John Prine</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can singer-song­writer John Prine, once de­scribed as the “Mark Twain of Amer­i­can song­writ­ing”, died in April at age 73 fol­low­ing com­pli­ca­tions of the coro­n­avirus. He had spent eight days in the in­ten­sive care unit and had pneu­mo­nia.</p>
    <p>The coun­try and folk singer first came to fame in the late 1960s and re­leased a crit­i­cally ac­claimed self­ti­tled de­but al­bum in 1971.</p>
    <p>The two-time Grammy win­ner was in­ducted into the Song­writ­ers Hall of Fame last year.</p>
    <p>Last month, the fi­nal song that he recorded, I Re­mem­ber Ev­ery­thing, shot to the top of the Rock Dig­i­tal Song chart, his first No. 1 work on the Amer­i­can Bill­board charts.</p>
    <p>6 Placido Domingo</p>
    <p>Span­ish opera star Placido Domingo was hos­pi­talised in Mexico af­ter be­ing di­ag­nosed with the coro­n­avirus in March.</p>
    <p>The 79-year-old wrote on so­cial me­dia that he felt fine. “For­tu­nately from the very first symp­tom, I was, as usual, un­der med­i­cal su­per­vi­sion, given my age and my co­mor­bid­ity, there­fore the Covid-19 in­fec­tion was im­me­di­ately sus­pected and this helped me a lot,” he said.</p>
    <p>Domingo, the win­ner of mul­ti­ple Grammy awards, has been em­broiled in al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual ha­rass­ment and abuse of power since last year, which has led to many of his per­for­mances be­ing can­celled.</p>
    <p>7 An­drea Bo­celli</p>
    <p>Ital­ian opera singer An­drea Bo­celli was di­ag­nosed with the coro­n­avirus in March, but kept it a se­cret.</p>
    <p>The 61-year-old, whose solo livestream­ed Easter con­cert in April broke records as the most-watched clas­si­cal mu­sic con­cert on YouTube, made it pub­lic in a Face­book post in May, ex­plain­ing that he wanted to pro­tect his fam­ily’s pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>He also re­vealed that he had re­cov­ered swiftly and com­pletely, and gave his blood to aid re­searchers in find­ing a cure for the virus.</p>
    <p>His son, Mat­teo, told US tele­vi­sion en­ter­tain­ment show Ex­tra that his father was lucky to have had no symp­toms when he had the virus.</p>
    <p>8 Kanye West</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can rap­per and fash­ion mogul Kanye West re­cently re­vealed to Forbes mag­a­zine that he had con­tracted and re­cov­ered from Covid-19 in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old bil­lion­aire, who is mar­ried to re­al­ity-tele­vi­sion star Kim Kar­dashian, said he suf­fered from “chills” and was “shak­ing in the bed”.</p>
    <p>He re­cently made head­lines when he an­nounced his bid for the US pres­i­dency later this year.</p>
    <p>9 Zaina Sze</p>
    <p>Singer Zaina Sze, 24, is be­lieved to be the first Hong Kong en­ter­tainer to be in­fected with Covid-19. She was di­ag­nosed on July 18.</p>
    <p>Her boyfriend, 61-year-old ac­tor Robert Mak, her man­ager Ap­ple Lau, 57, and her pro­moter Ah Jia were also found to have the virus.</p>
    <p>The news prompted broad­caster TVB City to shut its head­quar­ters for two days. It also in­formed more than 100 peo­ple who had come into con­tact with all four of them, in­clud­ing crew mem­bers and other en­ter­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>10 Pink</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can pop singer Pink re­vealed in April that she and her three-yearold son, Jameson, had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In an Instagram video, the 40-year-old said both of them “have been re­ally, re­ally sick”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve had many nights where I’ve cried and I’ve never prayed more in my life,” she added, not­ing that her son suf­fered from per­sis­tent high fever and other ail­ments such as con­sti­pa­tion and di­ar­rhoea.</p>
    <p>“There’s no one that is safe from this,” she said. They have since re­cov­ered.</p>
