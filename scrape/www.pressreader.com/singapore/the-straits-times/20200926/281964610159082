    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON US Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell and other top Repub­li­cans have re­pu­di­ated Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­fusal to com­mit to a peace­ful trans­fer of power, as­sur­ing Amer­i­can vot­ers the law­mak­ers would ac­cept the out­come of Novem­ber’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump de­clined on Wed­nes­day to em­brace a peace­ful tran­si­tion in re­sponse to a re­porter’s ques­tion and said he ex­pected his elec­tion bat­tle with Demo­crat Joe</p>
    <p>Bi­den to be set­tled by the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent’s rhetoric on Wed­nes­day, which largely re­ferred to vot­ing by mail, set off a fury that prompted sev­eral Repub­li­cans in Congress to dis­tance them­selves from him.</p>
    <p>De­spite four years of in­cen­di­ary state­ments by Mr Trump, mem­bers of his own party have been loath to crit­i­cise him, as many feared po­lit­i­cal ret­ri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>“The win­ner of the Novem­ber 3rd elec­tion will be in­au­gu­rated on Jan­uary 20th. There will be an or­derly tran­si­tion just as there has been every four years since 1792,” Mr McCon­nell wrote in a morn­ing tweet on Thurs­day. Like other Repub­li­cans, Mr McCon­nell did not di­rectly re­buke Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Other Repub­li­can lead­ers were more brusque.</p>
    <p>“Fun­da­men­tal to democ­racy is the peace­ful tran­si­tion of power; with­out that, there is Be­larus,” Repub­li­can Se­na­tor Mitt Rom­ney tweeted.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of Repub­li­can lead­ers joined the ef­fort to quell elec­tion fears, in­clud­ing Sen­a­tors Marco Ru­bio and House Repub­li­can leader Kevin McCarthy, who told re­porters: “It will be a smooth tran­si­tion re­gard­less of the out­come.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters just hours later on Thurs­day, Mr Trump dou­bled down on his stance, re­peat­ing base­less as­ser­tions that the vot­ing would be a “big scam”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said he did not know that an “honest” elec­tion could be held on Nov 3 “with this whole sit­u­a­tion, un­so­licited bal­lots”.</p>
    <p>For months, Mr Trump has cast the Novem­ber elec­tion as be­ing rigged and re­peat­edly at­tacked Democrats for pro­mot­ing wide­spread use of mail-in bal­lots for vot­ers who do not want to risk con­tract­ing the deadly Covid-19 virus by cast­ing their bal­lots at po­ten­tially crowded polling cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Wald­man, pres­i­dent of New York Univer­sity’s Bren­nan Cen­tre for Jus­tice, said vot­ing ar­range­ments were steadily ad­vanc­ing. In an in­ter­view with Reuters Tele­vi­sion, he added: “The sys­tem is not bro­ken. States are ac­tu­ally im­prov­ing their vot­ing rules day by day.”</p>
    <p>Democrats ac­cused Mr Trump of threat­en­ing Amer­i­can democ­racy and fur­ther politi­cis­ing his up­com­ing choice to re­place the l ate Supreme Court Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg by sug­gest­ing the yet-tobe named nom­i­nee would have a role in the elec­tion’s out­come.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who trails Mr Bi­den in na­tional opin­ion polls, has l ong sought to cast doubt on the le­git­i­macy of the elec­tion, as­sert­ing with­out ev­i­dence that mail-in vot­ing would be rife with fraud.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump, you are not a dic­ta­tor and Amer­ica will not per­mit you to be one,” said Se­nate Demo­cratic leader Chuck Schumer, call­ing him “the gravest threat” to US democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor Bernie San­ders, who lost to Mr Bi­den in the Demo­cratic Party’s pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nat­ing race, called for an in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sion to over­see the up­com­ing elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Speaker Nancy Pelosi cau­tioned against pan­ick­ing over the re­marks of a pres­i­dent who she said ad­mires au­to­cratic lead­ers. At a news con­fer­ence, she urged Amer­i­cans to cast their bal­lots and ad­mon­ished Mr Trump: “You are not in North Korea, you are not in Turkey, you are not in Rus­sia, Mr Pres­i­dent.”</p>
