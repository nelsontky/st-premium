    <p>Plea­sures of New Zealand</p>
    <p>From Tues­day, Sin­ga­pore is re­open­ing its bor­ders uni­lat­er­ally to New Zealand, a coun­try with ev­er­green ap­peal as a fresh-air es­cape.</p>
    <p>A Tri­pAd­vi­sor re­port in June in­di­cates that many travel lovers polled dur­ing the pan­demic now favour nat­u­ral havens, which com­bine re­lax­ation and easy so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Also, nearly half say they are more likely to take a road trip, com­pared with pre-pan­demic times, ac­cord­ing to the re­port ti­tled Be­yond Covid-19: The Road To Re­cov­ery For The Travel In­dus­try. New Zealand, with its good roads, is ideal for road-trip­pers.</p>
    <p>Right now, as the pan­demic has tem­po­rar­ily halted in­ter­na­tional leisure travel, Tourism New Zealand has been pro­mot­ing do­mes­tic tourism through its Do Some­thing New New Zealand cam­paign.</p>
    <p>At the same time, a new mul­ti­a­gency cam­paign is high­light­ing the coun­try to for­eign­ers as “a great place to live, study in, buy prod­ucts from, in­vest in and visit again when the time is right”, ac­cord­ing to Tourism New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Some trav­ellers fly to the coun­try to bask i n na­ture, choos­ing to kayak, cruise and walk in forests. Oth­ers are fas­ci­nated by the Maori cul­ture.</p>
    <p>My six-day road trip in New Zealand’s north, be­fore the pan­demic, was a snap­shot of the coun­try’s at­trac­tion for na­ture and cul­ture lovers, es­pe­cially if they are at the wheel.</p>
    <p>DO A HORSE TREK</p>
    <p>On my one-hour bayview scenic ride (NZ$75 or S$68 a per­son), my French-Chi­nese guide Emma Chaine, 26, and her horse led the way to a pa­naromic point over­look­ing the Wairoa Bay and back.</p>
    <p>My horse Sheekhan fol­lowed close be­hind as she trans­ported me, one step at a time, into a world of fresh air, sun and awe­some views.</p>
    <p>Soon, Sheekhan jazzed things up by mov­ing ahead of Emma and her horse. I wob­bled a lit­tle, but when</p>
    <p>Sheekhan – nick­named “Diva” for want­ing to be the lead­ing horse all the time – quickly slowed af­ter I pulled the reins, it was great to be on sure foot­ing in such a splen­did spot.</p>
    <p>There is also a two-hour trek (NZ$130) and, from Novem­ber to April, you can even take the horses for a splash or swim (NZ$150).</p>
    <p>Info: Horse Trek’n (www.horse­trekn.co.nz)</p>
    <p>IM­MERSE IN MAORI CUL­TURE</p>
    <p>Start your day pad­dling a 12m war ca­noe on Wai­tangi River. Later, re­live his­tory at the Wai­tangi Treaty Grounds, where an agree­ment was made on Feb 6, 1840, be­tween Bri­tish Crown rep­re­sen­ta­tives and more than 500 Maori chiefs, i n an era when Bri­tain claimed New Zealand as a colony.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can stand at the Flagstaff, the spot where the treaty was signed. Feb 6, known as Wai­tangi Day, is a pub­lic hol­i­day in New Zealand.</p>
    <p>My per­sonal Maori guide also took me to view the world’s largest cer­e­mo­nial war ca­noe at 35m long and to visit the treaty house where James Busby, the Bri­tish Govern­ment’s first rep­re­sen­ta­tive in New Zealand from 1833 to 1840, lived and worked in.</p>
    <p>If you are i n the mood for com­pany, head to the on-site cafe for the evening pro­gramme (only from Oc­to­ber to April).</p>
    <p>Get a pre-din­ner drink and find out how a hangi meal – in which food is cooked with a tra­di­tional Maori method of us­ing heated rocks buried in a pit oven – is made.</p>
    <p>Then, watch a Maori per­form­ing arts group be­fore head­ing back to the buf­fet din­ner at the cafe.</p>
    <p>There, I heaped my plates with ten­der meat, bread stuff­ing and veg­eta­bles, be­fore join­ing the other guests at the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>You are en­cour­aged to get to know one an­other at din­ner. Grouchy lon­ers, be warned.</p>

    <p>SEE WILD DOL­PHINS</p>
    <p>Dol­phin sight­ings on an af­ter­noon cruise around the Bay of Is­lands to the iconic Hole In The Rock in Mo­tukokako Is­land is a must-do.</p>
    <p>The sea can be rough, so pack along mo­tion-sick­ness pills. I was im­mensely re­lieved the pills did the trick, though they made me drowsy.</p>
    <p>The crew would an­nounce and com­ment on dol­phin sight­ings – even call­ing the dol­phins by name – much to our ex­cite­ment.</p>
    <p>I highly rec­om­mend it – it was just ex­hil­a­rat­ing to spy dol­phins in the wild.</p>
    <p>Info: Fullers GreatSight­s (www.dol­phin­cruises.co.nz)</p>
    <p>CHECK OUT AN­CIENT TREES</p>
    <p>Be awed by the ma­jes­tic kauri trees of Waipoua For­est in re­mote Hokianga, which is about an hour’s drive from Pai­hia.</p>
    <p>The for­est is home to New Zealand’s largest known liv­ing kauri tree, the Tane Mahuta, which is es­ti­mated to be 1,200 to 2,000 years old. It is im­mense, stand­ing at 51.5m high and with a trunk girth of 13.7m.</p>
    <p>You will also see the se­cond largest – and old­est – kauri tree.</p>
    <p>The Te Matua Nga­here or Fa­ther of the For­est is es­ti­mated to be more than 2,000 years old. It has a height of 29.9m and a trunk girth of 16.4m. Pic­tures do not do it jus­tice – you have to be there to soak in the en­ergy and won­der of the tree.</p>
    <p>As evening fell in the for­est, my won­der­fully en­gag­ing Maori guide, Mere Te­tai, 54, speaks about the deep re­spect the Maori have for na­ture.</p>
    <p>In a voice both fiery and melodic, she sings a haunt­ing Maori song.</p>
    <p>The for­est tour costs NZ$105 an adult and NZ$45 for chil­dren aged five to 12. Opt for the mys­ti­cal twi­light tour from 6 to 10pm.</p>
    <p>Info: Foot­prints Waipoua (www.foot­printswaip­oua.co.nz)</p>
    <p>EAT, SHOP AND WALK A SCULP­TURE TRAIL</p>
    <p>If you are driv­ing from Pai­hia to</p>
    <p>Auck­land, start in the morn­ing and aim to break the jour­ney of three or four hours at the Matakana Vil­lage Farm­ers’ Mar­ket and Brick Bay Wines & Sculp­ture Trail.</p>
    <p>En­joy the bus­tle of the Sat­ur­day farm­ers’ mar­ket (8am to 1pm), with happy crowds and the smell of cof­fee, burg­ers and siz­zling sausages. Lo­cals stock up on fresh pro­duce, breads and flow­ers, while vis­i­tors may like to take home olive oil, honey and nut but­ters.</p>
    <p>Then, a short drive will take you to Brick Bay in time for a calm­ing lunch at The Glass House Restau­rant, can­tilevered over a lake.</p>
    <p>The eatery, which serves beau­ti­fully plated fresh food, faces green­ery into which sculp­tures by lead­ing New Zealand artists are tucked. There was good en­ergy from the full-house crowd.</p>
    <p>After­wards, opt for a quick wine­tast­ing ses­sion be­fore im­mers­ing in a sen­sory art ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The goal is to find the sculp­tures – there are more than 60 of them – scat­tered along a de­light­ful 2km trail. They are placed along a path of peb­bles, atop grassy mounds, next to wooden board­walks, and among the trees. It is a splen­did tour done at your own pace.</p>
