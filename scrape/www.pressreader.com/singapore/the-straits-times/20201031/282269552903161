    <p>An up­com­ing air travel bub­ble with Hong Kong, mul­ti­ple green lanes for busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and se­lected coun­tries, and the uni­lat­eral open­ing of bor­ders to places such as New Zealand and Brunei.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are part of mea­sures to re­open Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders and re­vive the Changi air hub. Which coun­tries are on this list and what are the rules for trav­ellers when they ar­rive here?</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>UNI­LAT­ERAL OPEN­ING OF BOR­DERS TO TRAV­ELLERS FROM:</p>
    <p>• Brunei, New Zealand, Viet­nam, Aus­tralia and main­land China</p>
    <p>• Uni­lat­eral open­ings are a stand­ing in­vi­ta­tion from Sin­ga­pore to th­ese coun­tries, which have com­pre­hen­sive pub­lic health sur­veil­lance sys­tems and have suc­cess­fully con­trolled Covid-19’s spread. • Vis­i­tors here have to ap­ply for the Air Travel Pass for en­try – this al­lows for all forms of short-term travel, in­clud­ing leisure travel.</p>
    <p>• Vis­i­tors have to take a swab test on ar­rival, and can go about their ac­tiv­i­ties af­ter they test neg­a­tive. They have to use the TraceTo­gether app.</p>
    <p>• Main­land China and Vic­to­ria state in Aus­tralia are the lat­est ad­di­tions to this list, an­nounced on Thurs­day. They can ap­ply for the Air Travel Pass for en­try from Nov 6.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>BI­LAT­ERAL GREEN LANE AR­RANGE­MENTS</p>
    <p>Th­ese al­low for es­sen­tial travel for busi­ness or of­fi­cial pur­poses be­tween both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>• Ja­pan (from Sept 18): The Busi­ness Track al­lows for re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der travel and busi­ness ex­changes, with nec­es­sary pub­lic health safe­guards, such as test­ing be­fore trav­ellers leave and af­ter they ar­rive, and ad­her­ing to a con­trolled itin­er­ary for the first 14 days.</p>
    <p>• China (from June 8): China was the first coun­try to es­tab­lish a green lane with Sin­ga­pore. It is for six provinces and mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties: Shang­hai, Tian­jin, Chongqing, Guang­dong, Jiangsu and Zhe­jiang. • South Korea (from Sept 4): Con­di­tions in­clude pre-de­par­ture and post-ar­rival test­ing, and a con­trolled itin­er­ary for the first 14 days.</p>
    <p>• Malaysia (from Aug 17): Sin­ga­pore has two schemes – the Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane and the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment. The first fa­cil­i­tates cross-bor­der travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial pur­poses be­tween both coun­tries. The other al­lows Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia res­i­dents with long-term im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try to pe­ri­od­i­cally re­turn home for short-term home leave.</p>
    <p>• Brunei (from Sept 1)</p>
    <p>• In­done­sia: Ap­pli­ca­tions started on Oct 26. Those el­i­gi­ble are In­done­sian cit­i­zens, and Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>• Ger­many: Both coun­tries agreed on a green lane for es­sen­tial travel on Oct 23.</p>
    <p>3 AIR TRAVEL BUB­BLES</p>
    <p>• Hong Kong: Sin­ga­pore’s first two-way air travel bub­ble. Peo­ple will be able to travel be­tween the two lo­ca­tions with­out the need to be quar­an­tined, sub­ject to con­di­tions, in­clud­ing test­ing neg­a­tive for Covid-19. De­tails are still be­ing worked out.</p>
