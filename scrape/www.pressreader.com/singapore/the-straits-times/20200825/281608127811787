    <p>If there was one theme that stood out in the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress yes­ter­day, it was: Change.</p>
    <p>Ex­ter­nally, a changed and un­sta­ble global or­der has rat­tled the foun­da­tions on which Sin­ga­pore, an open city-state, has thrived.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­ti­cally, chang­ing as­pi­ra­tions of a new gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans mean they want more di­verse voices and stronger checks and bal­ances.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob ad­dressed a changed Par­lia­ment, too.</p>
    <p>Aside from open­ing in two lo­ca­tions for the first time ow­ing to safe dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments, the 14th Par­lia­ment wel­comed a record num­ber of 28 women and the first of­fi­cial Leader of the Op­po­si­tion: Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh.</p>
    <p>It was also a House that saw the youngest elected Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment be­ing sworn in – 27-year-old Ms Raeesah Khan, an MP for Sengkang GRC.</p>
    <p>Early in her speech, Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Hal­imah threw down the gaunt­let for mem­bers of the House to be open to change, say­ing that “no so­lu­tions are right for all time”.</p>
    <p>But this should not be con­strued as a blank cheque to en­gage in ver­bal fisticuffs, as Sin­ga­pore re­mains vul­ner­a­ble to US-China ri­valry, dis­rupted sup­ply chains and ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ism.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin’s warn­ing against “po­lar­i­sa­tion and di­vi­sion, pop­ulism and short­ter­mism”, she said a broad con­sen­sus must be forged on the eco­nomic and so­cial changes that are needed for the coun­try to sur­vive and thrive.</p>
    <p>It was a dis­tinct tonal shift from her in­au­gu­ral ad­dress in May 2018, when she out­lined pri­or­i­ties such as build­ing a world-class city, de­vel­op­ing a vibrant econ­omy, and forg­ing a car­ing and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>This time, there was a greater sense of ur­gency and sharper fo­cus, akin to the “cri­sis” speeches given by then Pres­i­dent Ben­jamin Sheares in the wake of the 1970s oil crises and Mr S R Nathan in 2002 af­ter the Sept 11, 2001 at­tacks in the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr Nathan’s ad­dress, for ex­am­ple, had put the spot­light on eco­nomic re­struc­tur­ing. He said: “We can­not af­ford to shel­ter in­ef­fi­cient, pro­tected sec­tors in our econ­omy. All parts of our econ­omy must be­come com­pet­i­tive and ef­fi­cient, for that is the only way to cre­ate pro­duc­tive, well-pay­ing jobs.”</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah, too, promised that jobs re­main a top pri­or­ity for the next few years. But this can­not just be about giv­ing busi­nesses cash and credit so that they can hold on to their work­ers, she said.</p>
    <p>In­stead, more change is afoot – from up­skilling ma­ture work­ers to beef­ing up dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity to ex­plor­ing new growth ar­eas in food, health­care and sup­ply chain man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>There will also be a per­ma­nent shift to more so­cial sup­port af­ter this cri­sis, from hous­ing and ed­u­ca­tion, to jobs and re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy.</p>
    <p>For a coun­try whose so­cial poli­cies have been founded on the prin­ci­ple of self-reliance for more than 50 years, this is a rad­i­cal change – one that is needed in an era so volatile and dis­rup­tive, she ex­plained. But re­dis­tribu­tive mea­sures can only paper over struc­tural fault lines.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s model of mer­i­toc­racy must evolve, so that so­ci­ety does not strat­ify and os­sify over time.</p>
    <p>“Un­fet­tered mer­i­toc­racy can fos­ter ex­ces­sive com­pe­ti­tion. We also re­alise the need to level up fam­i­lies who are at a dis­ad­van­tage and give their chil­dren a fair start in life,” she said, adding that in­vest­ing in ed­u­cat­ing and train­ing is key.</p>
    <p>As she did in her maiden speech in Par­lia­ment as Pres­i­dent two years ago, Madam Hal­imah spoke of the Sin­ga­porean iden­tity.</p>
    <p>But yes­ter­day, she fo­cused on the coun­try’s evolv­ing mul­ti­cul­tural fab­ric – from younger Sin­ga­pore­ans’ will­ing­ness to speak up on sen­si­tive is­sues of race, lan­guage and re­li­gion, to grow­ing anx­i­ety over com­pe­ti­tion with for­eign­ers for jobs.</p>
    <p>As­sur­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans that their in­ter­ests will al­ways be put first, she called on them to dis­cuss th­ese is­sues with re­straint and mu­tual re­spect, and con­tinue to wel­come and in­te­grate for­eign­ers who can con­trib­ute.</p>
    <p>She urged them to lis­ten to one another and break out of the echo cham­bers that form eas­ily on­line.</p>
    <p>Th­ese guid­ing prin­ci­ples ex­tend to the evolv­ing po­lit­i­cal land­scape too, now that the op­po­si­tion has a for­mally des­ig­nated leader and 12 rep­re­sen­ta­tives in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>On is­sues which are core to Sin­ga­pore’s sur­vival and fu­ture, she</p>
