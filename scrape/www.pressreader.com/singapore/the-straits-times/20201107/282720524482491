    <p>NEW YORK • The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (NBPA) on Thurs­day ten­ta­tively ap­proved the league’s plan to start the 2020-21 sea­son on Dec 22, which would re­quire play­ers to re­port to their teams for train­ing camps in less than a month – barely seven weeks af­ter the end of the pan­demic-dis­rupted pre­vi­ous sea­son.</p>
    <p>The union an­nounced that it had ten­ta­tively ac­cepted the sched­ul­ing el­e­ments of the league’s pro­posal to be­gin a short­ened 72-game reg­u­lar sea­son be­fore Christ­mas, a plan that took shape only two weeks ago at the strong urg­ing of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s (NBA) tele­vi­sion part­ners.</p>
    <p>The ap­proval came in a vote of the league’s 30 player rep­re­sen­ta­tives, one from each team.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions to lock the new sched­ule in, how­ever, are likely to con­tinue into next week on some out­stand­ing salary-cap and health and safety mat­ters.</p>
    <p>“Ad­di­tional de­tails re­main to be ne­go­ti­ated, and the NBPA is con­fi­dent that the par­ties will reach agree­ment on these re­main­ing is­sues rel­e­vant to the up­com­ing sea­son,” the union said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed sched­ule calls for train­ing camps to be­gin on Dec 1 and the reg­u­lar sea­son, 10 games shorter than usual, would then run through midMay, with the play-offs last­ing into July.</p>
    <p>The NBA’s goal is to com­plete the 2020-21 sea­son be­fore the July 23 to Aug 8 Tokyo Olympics next year and thus set up the 2021-22 sea­son to re­turn to the usual Oc­to­ber-through-June pat­tern.</p>
    <p>The plan is also strongly pre­ferred by the pri­mary me­dia part­ners, Dis­ney and Turner, fol­low­ing a sum­mer and fall of dis­mal rat­ings. But there were un­re­solved talks about a new ar­ray of coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols that will be needed be­cause teams are plan­ning to play in their home mar­kets rather than in a “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>The league and the union are also still hag­gling over how much of the play­ers’ salaries in the next two seasons will be placed into es­crow.</p>
    <p>Each sea­son, the NBA’s 30 teams are re­quired to spend roughly half of the league’s bas­ket­ball-re­lated in­come on player salaries.</p>
    <p>The NBA typ­i­cally holds 10 per cent of each player’s salary in es­crow un­til the in­come has been tal­lied. The money in es­crow is used to make up the dif­fer­ence for the play­ers, in case the to­tal paid out was too low, or the own­ers, if the to­tal was too high.</p>
    <p>The sides have been dis­cussing a plan that would place roughly 18 per cent of player salaries over the next two seasons in es­crow.</p>
    <p>The sea­son is ex­pected to be played in largely empty are­nas be­cause of the pan­demic, which will sharply re­duce rev­enue.</p>
    <p>In a typ­i­cal year, Fi­nals teams have at least three months off, but the league is ex­pected to make fi­nan­cial con­ces­sions to counter the push­back from play­ers on those teams and oth­ers who wanted a longer break af­ter the rigours of the “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>Open­ing on Dec 22 would en­able Turner to broad­cast its usual Tues­day night dou­ble-header to start the sea­son while also pre­serv­ing Dis­ney’s lu­cra­tive five-game slate that has be­come a sta­ple of Christ­mas Day’s TV of­fer­ings.</p>
