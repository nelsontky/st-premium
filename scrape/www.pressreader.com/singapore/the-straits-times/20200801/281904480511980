    <p>• A Chi­nese re­searcher ar­rested in Cal­i­for­nia is a mil­i­tary of­fi­cial who should be treated as a spy, de­nied bail and kept in jail while she awaits trial on visa fraud charges, US pros­e­cu­tors have said.</p>
    <p>As Juan Tang headed back to court yes­ter­day for a hear­ing on whether she should be re­leased on bail, gov­ern­ment lawyers told a fed­eral judge that there is a se­ri­ous risk she would try to flee with the full backing and re­sources of the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>China has demon­strated “ev­ery rea­son to as­sist Tang in flee­ing the United States and has at its dis­posal means such as ac­tive con­sular and in­tel­li­gence ser­vices, the abil­ity to i ssue pass­ports, and state-con­trolled air trans­port”, pros­e­cu­tors said in a court fil­ing.</p>
    <p>Tang’s re­turn to China would bol­ster its “in­for­ma­tion col­lec­tion ac­tiv­i­ties” in the US, they said.</p>
    <p>Tang is one of sev­eral Chi­nese scholar visa hold­ers in more than 25 Amer­i­can cities who the Jus­tice De­part­ment sus­pects of hav­ing an “un­de­clared af­fil­i­a­tion” with the Chi­nese mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Her pros­e­cu­tion has be­come a flash point of ten­sion be­tween the US and China, which have sparred pub­licly by clos­ing each other’s diplo­matic mis­sions in Hous­ton and Chengdu.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors’ por­trayal of the threat Tang poses con­trasts starkly with the de­scrip­tion by her lawyer in a court fil­ing on Wed­nes­day of overzeal­ous Amer­i­can law en­force­ment of­fi­cials mon­i­tor­ing the re­searcher’s re­treat to the Chi­nese con­sulate in San Fran­cisco for a month, and ar­rest­ing her af­ter she left the prop­erty and got med­i­cal treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Tang, 37, is be­ing held in county jail in Sacra­mento, near where she did cancer re­search at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia at Davis.</p>
    <p>A key ques­tion has been whether Tang left the con­sulate on her own or as the re­sult of some agree­ment be­tween the US and Chi­nese sides.</p>
    <p>Ms Lexi Ne­gin, the pub­lic de­fender rep­re­sent­ing Tang, said the scholar vol­un­tar­ily sur­ren­dered to law en­force­ment of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Ms Ne­gin on Thurs­day called the US ac­cu­sa­tion that the con­sulate would help her flee “base­less”, given that Chi­nese of­fi­cials did not seize the chance to get Tang out of the coun­try when they first learnt there was a war­rant for her ar­rest and did not keep her at the con­sulate, know­ing she would be ap­pre­hended when she left.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said Tang’s false de­nials when FBI agents in­ter­viewed her at her apart­ment i n Davis about her mil­i­tary af­fil­i­a­tion and her mem­ber­ship in the Com­mu­nist Party mir­ror the ef­forts of three other Chi­nese re­searchers in Cal­i­for­nia and In­di­ana to cover up their past lives be­fore they were re­cently charged.</p>
    <p>Tang sought shel­ter at the con­sulate in San Fran­cisco af­ter the agents in­ter­viewed her, ac­cord­ing to Ms Ne­gin’s fil­ing.</p>
    <p>The re­searcher was in “hys­ter­ics” af­ter learn­ing of the war­rant for her ar­rest, lead­ing con­sulate of­fi­cials to be­lieve she needed to see a doc­tor, Ms Ne­gin wrote.</p>
    <p>Ms Ne­gin said she thinks Amer­i­can l aw en­force­ment of­fi­cials were watch­ing the build­ing and fol­lowed Tang’s car to a med­i­cal of­fice were she was treated.</p>
    <p>The lawyer also said in an e-mail that the de­tails about Tang’s ar­rest came from a pros­e­cu­tor who was not per­son­ally in­volved in her de­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­quest for Tang’s re­lease said her hus­band is a doc­tor liv­ing with their daugh­ter in China. Her fil­ing says pieces of pros­e­cu­tors’ ev­i­dence are “weak and lend them­selves to many in­no­cent ex­pla­na­tions”, in­clud­ing pho­to­graphs of Tang in mil­i­tary uni­form.</p>
    <p>“Ms Tang ap­par­ently at­tended a pres­ti­gious med­i­cal school that is run by the mil­i­tary in China,” ac­cord­ing to the fil­ing. “That does not mean that she was ‘in the mil­i­tary’.”</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told a daily brief­ing in Bei­jing yes­ter­day that the gov­ern­ment was “closely fol­low­ing the de­vel­op­ment of this case and we will, as al­ways, pro­vide con­sular as­sis­tance to the peo­ple in­volved”.</p>
