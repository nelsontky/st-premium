    <p>En­tre­pre­neur Chris­tine Yue, 39, started her home busi­ness sell­ing lor bak, or braised meat, with her back against the wall.</p>
    <p>Since Fe­bru­ary, her nail salon Doll­house Nails, lo­cated at Citylink mall, had seen busi­ness fall by about 60 per cent. Even be­fore the cir­cuit breaker be­gan in April, cus­tomers were al­ready stay­ing away as fears of the coro­n­avirus took hold and more peo­ple started work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>She says it was a “scary and stress­ful time” be­cause she has an 11-month-old son at home and her hus­band, a 37-year-old 3D de­signer, had taken a 30 per cent pay cut. Launch­ing Lor­bak Mama in May helped stem the losses, but her first foray into the food and bev­er­age (F&B) in­dus­try threw up a steep learn­ing curve.</p>
    <p>“I know only how to cook. I didn’t have the bud­get to take pro­fes­sional pho­tos and didn’t know what sort of pho­tos would ap­peal to cus­tomers,” says Ms Yue.</p>
    <p>En­ter pho­tog­ra­pher Jeryl Tan. He, too, had lost work over the past few months and de­cided to help F&B own­ers mar­ket their busi­ness by of­fer­ing free food pho­tog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>He is among a small num­ber of cre­atives who have re­cently pitched in to help F&B es­tab­lish­ments stand out in a crowded mar­ket­place.</p>
    <p>Although there were many Face­book groups pro­mot­ing small lo­cal busi­nesses that did not have a strong dig­i­tal pres­ence, those with­out at­trac­tive im­ages, he no­ticed, tended to lag be­hind.</p>
    <p>“I saw a dras­tic dif­fer­ence in en­gage­ment be­tween the hawk­ers who have so­cial me­dia and pho­tog­ra­phy know-how, and those who don’t.</p>
    <p>“When the food looks good, the photo is more likely to get ‘likes’ and shares and make peo­ple want to give it a try. It felt like an un­fair fight,” says Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>He launched the project in May and ran it for seven weeks, pho­tograph­ing food from 41 busi­nesses. Some used them pri­mar­ily on so­cial me­dia, while oth­ers listed the pho­tos on food de­liv­ery plat­forms such as Grab or Food­panda.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan says: “Ev­ery F&B owner is do­ing this to sup­port his fam­ily. Pho­tos are no guar­an­tee that they can earn more, but give them a shot at in­creas­ing their in­come.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Yue, his pho­tos have in­creased sales by about 20 per cent. Much of what she earns now goes to rent and keep­ing her 10 salon staff, many of whom are for­eign­ers, on pay­roll.</p>
    <p>With steady or­ders of up to 60 por­tions at lunchtime, she also en­gages a pool of 10 to 15 Grab driv­ers, who have lost work due to the coro­n­avirus, to ful­fil the de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>“It’s a re­ally tough time, but ev­ery­one is do­ing what he can to help one another,” she says.</p>
    <p>Co-founders of brand­ing and mar­ket­ing con­sul­tancy Work in Progress Crys­tal Fam and Elyena Lee, both 29, launched a sim­i­lar ini­tia­tive when they no­ticed that many busi­nesses abruptly shunted on­line by the cir­cuit breaker had messy, poorly or­gan­ised menus.</p>
    <p>“Some own­ers would up­load the menu as an al­bum, with prices in each cap­tion. It is te­dious to browse and peo­ple might not have the pa­tience to go through 10 to 15 pho­tos,” says Ms Lee, who re­alised this while try­ing to or­der food for her fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>In June, they launched Com­mu­nity in Progress, which cre­ates per­son­alised, branded menus for small com­pa­nies that lack the staff or know-how to do it them­selves.</p>
    <p>This in­volved com­ing up with a colour scheme and ty­pog­ra­phy that suited each busi­ness, such as pas­tel shades for an ice cream seller. For brands with­out strong pho­tos, de­sign­ers would sketch food items for the menu in­stead.</p>
    <p>“As our ex­per­tise lay in mar­ket­ing and de­sign, we saw this as the best way we could value-add,” says Ms Lee, who roped in about 10 free­lance de­sign­ers to con­trib­ute.</p>
    <p>She in­tends to run the project for as long as the com­pany can han­dle it, but may im­ple­ment a small fee to re­im­burse de­sign­ers in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>They have de­signed menus for about 20 busi­nesses so far, in­clud­ing fam­ily-run bak­ery Nine­teen Niche, which opened the first of its three branches in 2012.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant Deb­bie Lim, 28, who han­dles so­cial me­dia for the bak­ery founded by her mother, Madam Ivy Leow, de­scribes it as a tra­di­tional brand that does not fo­cus on mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>“We rely on word of mouth and don’t fol­low what other bak­eries are do­ing. But with the cir­cuit breaker and our reg­u­lar cus­tomers work­ing from home, we had to adapt to do­ing more de­liv­er­ies and</p>
