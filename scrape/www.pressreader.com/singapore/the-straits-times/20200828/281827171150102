    <p>PARIS • France is ready to in­sti­tute a new na­tional lock­down as a last re­sort as Europe grap­ples with how to con­tain the resur­gent coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Plans to re­strict move­ment were ready, but France will do ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble to avoid mea­sures that clob­bered the econ­omy in the sec­ond quar­ter, French Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Italy and Spain have also re­jected strin­gent na­tional lock­downs, while top Ger­man politi­cians quar­relled over new test­ing guide­lines.</p>
    <p>“The epi­demic is gain­ing ground, and we need to in­ter­vene now,” said Mr Cas­tex said, re­ject­ing the need for broad re­stric­tions and adding that “this doesn’t mean the sit­u­a­tion is as se­ri­ous as it was” ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“The virus is spread­ing all over the coun­try,” he cau­tioned. “The spread of the epi­demic can be ex­po­nen­tial if we do not re­act quickly.”</p>
    <p>The virus’ re­pro­duc­tion level has jumped, with in­fec­tions surg­ing in the Paris re­gion and among young peo­ple. France’s Covid-19 re­pro­duc­tion “R” num­ber was now 1.4, Mr Cas­tex told a news brief­ing, in­di­cat­ing the over­all epi­demic is grow­ing.</p>
    <p>Grand­par­ents are be­ing told not to pick up their grand­chil­dren from school as the gov­ern­ment is wor­ried about hos­pi­tals be­ing over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>The French Health Min­istry on Wed­nes­day re­ported 5,429 new daily in­fec­tions, a new post-lock­down high and a level of new in­fec­tions not seen since the height of the epi­demic in early April.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing face masks out­doors in Paris will now be com­pul­sory, Mr Cas­tex said. Mar­seille, France’s sec­ond-largest city, has also made masks manda­tory ev­ery­where and bars and restau­rants have to close by 11 pm.</p>
    <p>Europe’s lead­ers are strug­gling with how to re­spond to the lat­est de­vel­op­ments in the pan­demic, and are wary of sweep­ing mea­sures that could hob­ble re­cov­er­ing economies.</p>
    <p>Warn­ing of the risks ahead, World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion re­gional direc­tor for Europe Hans Kluge told a news brief­ing yes­ter­day that ris­ing in­fec­tions among youth are a ma­jor risk, es­pe­cially to the el­derly dur­ing win­ter.</p>
    <p>“The younger peo­ple are not nec­es­sar­ily go­ing to die from it but it’s a tor­nado with a long tail,” he told re­porters.</p>
