    <p>In the South Korean com­e­dydrama Birth­care Cen­ter, ac­tress Uhm Ji-won had to act with in­fants and prac­tise walk­ing like a preg­nant woman. The 42-year-old plays a ca­reer woman who be­comes a mother in her 40s and is the old­est new mother stay­ing at a post-par­tum care cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Uhm (Hope, 2013) and her costar Park Ha-sun tell The Straits Times over e-mail five things to know about their lat­est drama – now stream­ing on Viu.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>AT­TEN­TION TO DE­TAIL</p>
    <p>In real life, Uhm mar­ried her ar­chi­tect hus­band Oh Young-wook in 2014 but the cou­ple have no chil­dren.</p>
    <p>To re­al­is­ti­cally play a new mother, she talked to friends with kids and did her own re­search too.</p>
    <p>“I looked into the in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal changes to the body af­ter preg­nancy and giv­ing birth, the emo­tions ex­pe­ri­enced dur­ing the process, the way preg­nant women walk, how they feel dur­ing de­liv­ery, and how their re­la­tion­ship with their hus­bands changed,” she says.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>COM­FORT FOR NEW MOTH­ERS</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Park (Three Days, 2014), who is mar­ried to ac­tor Ryu Soo-young and has a three-year-old daugh­ter with him, says the drama is em­pa­thetic to the strug­gles of moth­er­hood.</p>
    <p>In the se­ries, she plays a seem­ingly per­fect mother who ini­tially in­tim­i­dates Uhm’s char­ac­ter Hyun-jin.</p>
    <p>But the 33-year-old says there is no need for moth­ers to be in­fal­li­ble. “In this drama, mes­sages like ‘There is a first time for ev­ery­one, it’s okay to be clumsy and fig­ure things out’ and ‘You are a good mother and a pre­cious per­son’ are what we hope to send out to com­fort new moth­ers.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>BA­BIES RULE THE SCREEN</p>
    <p>Film­ing Birth­care Cen­ter meant the cast had to shoot ex­tended scenes with in­fants and young chil­dren and they were more cau­tious on set to en­sure the safety of the lit­tle ones.</p>
    <p>Uhm says the baby who played her new­born, nick­named Glue Stick in the se­ries, was a break­out star.</p>
    <p>She says: “Baby Kim-sun had to do more act­ing than an ac­tual ac­tor. We were most wor­ried about whether that would work out well, but thank good­ness the baby was a nat­u­ral when it came to film­ing.”</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>SHOW RE­FLECTS LIFE</p>
    <p>Both ac­tresses see par­al­lels be­tween their own char­ac­ters and them­selves.</p>
    <p>In Uhm’s case, she says: “My char­ac­ter is a hard­work­ing ca­reer­fo­cused woman and be­fore she knew it, her 40s had al­ready crept up on her. That is some­thing that we both have in com­mon.”</p>
    <p>Park says she took com­fort from her char­ac­ter, who is deal­ing with prob­lems de­spite seem­ing to be an ideal mother.</p>
    <p>She says: “No one is per­fect, ev­ery­one is lack­ing in a way and try­ing to fill the gaps that she might have.”</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>TOP-DRAWER CAST</p>
    <p>Aside from Uhm and Park, the drama also stars Jang Hye-jin – who plays a ma­jor role as a poor fam­ily’s ma­tri­arch in di­rec­tor Bong Joon-ho’s Os­car-win­ning film Par­a­site (2019).</p>
    <p>In the se­ries, Jang, 45, runs the post-par­tum care cen­tre the women stay at.</p>
    <p>Park says of her: “She seems like some­one who is re­ally so­phis­ti­cated and not eas­ily ap­proach­able. But she treated me just like a friendly neigh­bour would and was some­one com­fort­able to work with. Also, she was re­ally witty.”</p>
