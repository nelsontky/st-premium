    <p>A for­mer na­tional foot­ball player was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to 18 weeks’ jail and fined $1,000 for of­fences in­clud­ing mo­lest­ing his Tin­der date’s friend.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent hap­pened af­ter Mo­ham­mad Im­ran Sahib Mo­hamed Ibrahim Sahib met a woman on the on­line dat­ing plat­form and they went club­bing to­gether in 2018 with one of her fe­male friends.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the night out, the mar­ried man de­cided to send both women home in his car. But, af­ter drop­ping off his date, he mo­lested the vic­tim when they were alone.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim and her friend can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der.</p>
    <p>Last month, af­ter a trial, Dis­trict Judge Kan Shuk Weng con­victed the 38-year-old Sin­ga­porean of two counts of mo­lesta­tion and one count of us­ing crim­i­nal force on the vic­tim.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Judge Kan said that one of the acts of mo­lesta­tion took place while the car was on the move, re­duc­ing the vic­tim’s chance of es­cape.</p>
    <p>She noted that the fa­ther of three is a first-time of­fender and had con­trib­uted to Sin­ga­pore’s sport­ing scene when he was a na­tional foot­ball player.</p>
    <p>In her sub­mis­sions dur­ing the trial, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Chee Ee Ling said that af­ter Im­ran and the two women left a club called Bal­iza in Raf­fles Boule­vard at around 6am on March 4, 2018, his date threw up.</p>
    <p>While her friend was look­ing af­ter her, Im­ran grabbed and kissed the vic­tim on the lips. But she still got into his car, as she did not want to leave her friend alone with him.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his date got out of the car at her des­ti­na­tion, Im­ran told the vic­tim to sit in the front pas­sen­ger seat. He mo­lested her again as they were trav­el­ling along Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 6.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim got out of the car “in a frenzy” when Im­ran stopped by the road­side to re­lieve him­self.</p>
    <p>DPP Chee said the “ter­ri­fied” vic­tim “walked bare­footed to (her friend’s block of flats) for about 1½ km”, and that “in the vic­tim’s haste, she left her high-heeled shoes in the ac­cused’s car”.</p>
    <p>She ar­rived at the void deck at 7.17am and waited un­til around 8am be­fore tak­ing a taxi home.</p>
    <p>Although she told her sis­ter about her or­deal, the vic­tim waited 16 days to make a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>DPP Chee said she was ini­tially afraid of Im­ran.</p>
    <p>The court heard that since the in­ci­dent, the vic­tim has “had night­mares of peo­ple rap­ing her and there was once she dreamt that she com­mit­ted sui­cide”.</p>
    <p>Im­ran in­tends to ap­peal against his con­vic­tion and sen­tence.</p>
    <p>His bail was set at $15,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Chee Ee Ling said the “ter­ri­fied” vic­tim “walked bare­footed to (her friend’s block of flats) for about 1½ km”, and that “in the vic­tim’s haste, she left her high-heeled shoes in the ac­cused’s car”.</p>
