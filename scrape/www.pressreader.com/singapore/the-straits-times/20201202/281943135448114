    <p>This year marks 35 years since the first pa­tient was di­ag­nosed with HIV in­fec­tion in Sin­ga­pore in 1985. In the fol­low­ing years, the num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing with HIV in Sin­ga­pore has steadily in­creased, with a to­tal of 8,618 peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore hav­ing been di­ag­nosed with the in­fec­tion, of whom 2,097 have died, as of end-2019.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases re­ported to the Na­tional HIV Reg­istry yearly has also been on an up­ward trend, peak­ing at more than 400 new di­ag­noses an­nu­ally in the mid-2010s, be­fore fall­ing in 2018.</p>
    <p>The year 2020, will, un­doubt­edly, go down in his­tory as the year when the world was rav­aged by a coro­n­avirus now named the Se­vere Acute Res­pi­ra­tory Syn­drome Coro­n­avirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2, which causes Coro­n­avirus Disease 2019 or Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A pan­demic on an un­prece­dented scale, Covid-19 first reached our shores on Jan 23. A con­certed, whole-na­tion ap­proach meant that Sin­ga­pore man­aged to avoid the high mor­tal­ity rates seen in other coun­tries, while en­sur­ing that so­ci­ety and the econ­omy do not com­pletely shut down.</p>
    <p>HIV and Sars-CoV-2 have a num­ber of in­ter­est­ing sim­i­lar­i­ties. Both are RNA viruses, wherein their ge­netic codes are in the form of ri­bonu­cleic acid, as op­posed to hu­mans and other an­i­mals with de­oxyri­bonu­cleic acid or DNA.</p>
    <p>Both viruses emerged re­cently in hu­man his­tory, caus­ing mod­ern-day plagues; it is easy to for­get that HIV and the Ac­quired Im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency Syn­drome, or Aids, emerged in the 1980s. Due to their novel na­tures and the fact that they both caused se­vere disease and even death in large num­bers of those in­fected, they were re­spon­si­ble for caus­ing panic and dis­rup­tions to daily life.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are also im­por­tant dis­tinc­tions be­tween the two viruses and how they af­fect those in­fected. Sars-CoV-2 is much more in­fec­tious, be­ing trans­mit­ted pri­mar­ily through res­pi­ra­tory droplets. HIV, be­ing a blood-borne virus, can be trans­mit­ted only through ex­po­sure to in­fected body flu­ids such as sex­ual se­cre­tions, blood and breast milk.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 causes se­vere ill­ness in about 20 per cent of those in­fected, and crit­i­cal ill­ness and death in up to 5 per cent, whereas un­treated HIV in­fec­tion and Aids are uni­formly fa­tal. HIV was dis­cov­ered to be the cause of Aids in 1983, years af­ter the first cases of deaths due to se­vere im­mune com­pro­mise were re­ported in the United States in the late 1970s. The dis­cov­ery won Fran­coise Barre-Si­noussi and Luc Mon­tag­nier the 2008 No­bel Prize in Phys­i­ol­ogy and Medicine.</p>
    <p>To date, while there are highly ef­fec­tive anti-retro­vi­ral med­i­ca­tions which can ren­der peo­ple liv­ing with HIV healthy and ef­fec­tively in­ca­pable of trans­mit­ting the virus to oth­ers, a cure and a vac­cine for the disease still re­main elu­sive.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, the map­ping of the en­tire genome of Sars-CoV-2, as well as an un­der­stand­ing of its trans­mis­sion, and sev­eral promis­ing can­di­dates for treat­ment and vac­cine, have all been achieved in the short months since the first clus­ter of novel pneu­mo­nia was de­scribed in Wuhan, China, on Dec 31 last year.</p>
    <p>THE FEAR FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>In our ap­proach to­wards Sars-CoV-2 and Covid-19 as a na­tion, and in­deed as a hu­man race, many lessons can be learned from our ex­pe­ri­ence with HIV. In the early days of HIV, there was much fear sur­round­ing its in­fec­tious­ness, and the fact that it caused a seem­ingly un­stop­pable march to­wards pro­gres­sive de­struc­tion of the im­mune sys­tem, re­sult­ing in death from op­por­tunis­tic in­fec­tions and can­cers.</p>
    <p>Fear and lack of knowl­edge of its spread and help­less­ness in the ab­sence of a cure or treat­ment re­sulted in much stigma and dis­crim­i­na­tion which, un­for­tu­nately, still lingers to­day against those in­fected.</p>
    <p>This fear of in­fec­tion, or con­ta­gion, is also per­va­sive in the cur­rent pan­demic, with nu­mer­ous re­ports of peo­ple with Covid-19 – or even those sus­pected to be at risk of in­fec­tion, like health­care pro­fes­sion­als and other front-line work­ers – be­ing sub­jected to dis­crim­i­na­tory be­hav­iour, such as ver­bal or phys­i­cal abuse and evic­tion from their homes.</p>
    <p>We can see that stigma is born out of fear, and fear arises from a lack of knowl­edge or un­der­stand­ing. The fear of be­ing stig­ma­tised or dis­crim­i­nated against may also lead those most at risk of in­fec­tion to avoid get­ting di­ag­nosed and seek­ing med­i­cal at­ten­tion when they most need it. This can have dis­as­trous con­se­quences both for them­selves and those around them. It can lead to those in­fected de­vel­op­ing more se­vere ill­ness, as well as un­know­ingly in­fect­ing those they come in con­tact with, whether by not tak­ing the ap­pro­pri­ate pro­tec­tion dur­ing sex to pre­vent the trans­mis­sion of HIV, or not wear­ing a mask and self-iso­lat­ing to pre­vent the spread of Sars-CoV-2.</p>
    <p>The stigma sur­round­ing a disease can some­times be more harm­ful and dan­ger­ous than the disease it­self, and over­com­ing the chal­lenges posed by the pan­demic will re­quire a con­certed ef­fort, based on com­pas­sion and rooted in science, as well as the in­volve­ment and par­tic­i­pa­tion of the en­tirety of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has had an in­deli­ble im­pact on many as­pects of ev­ery­day life. It has also af­fected the lives of peo­ple liv­ing with HIV in nu­mer­ous ways, not least of all in the way that care for their ill­ness has been af­fected dur­ing this coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple liv­ing with HIV re­quire reg­u­lar fol­low-up vis­its with their care providers in or­der to en­sure that treat­ment con­tin­ues to be ef­fec­tive, and that they en­joy good gen­eral health and well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>HIV care in Sin­ga­pore re­mains cen­tred in spe­cial­ist hos­pi­tals and is pro­vided pri­mar­ily by in­fec­tious disease physi­cians, who are also part of the main van­guard pro­vid­ing Covid-19 care.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, sig­nif­i­cant re­sources needed to be di­verted to help cope with the Covid-19 re­sponse.</p>
    <p>To add to this sit­u­a­tion, lit­tle was known ear­lier in the year about whether peo­ple liv­ing with HIV were at greater risk of Covid-19 in­fec­tion, se­vere Covid-19 or mor­tal­ity, and hence a more con­ser­va­tive ap­proach was em­ployed. Ef­forts were made to re­duce the risk of ex­pos­ing them to the virus by re­duc­ing as much as pos­si­ble the need for them to make hos­pi­tal vis­its.</p>
    <p>HIV physi­cians have had to find in­no­va­tive ways to pro­vide safe and ef­fec­tive care. We ac­com­plished this in sev­eral ways. First, we adopted tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions such as tele­health, pro­vid­ing con­sul­ta­tions for se­lected pa­tients via se­cure video-con­fer­enc­ing, al­low­ing us to ad­dress our pa­tients’ con­cerns with­out the need for them to be phys­i­cally present in the clinic.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, we ju­di­ciously pro­longed the du­ra­tion be­tween reg­u­lar clinic vis­its for those pa­tients with well-con­trolled HIV, while en­sur­ing that all pa­tients could con­tact the clinic in case of emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>Third, we en­cour­aged the use of home de­liv­ery of med­i­ca­tions, fur­ther re­duc­ing the time pa­tients have to spend in po­ten­tially crowded hos­pi­tal phar­ma­cies.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, we avoided mak­ing changes to treat­ment reg­i­mens un­less ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary to re­duce the need for ad­di­tional fol­low-up dur­ing this time.</p>
    <p>In so do­ing, we were able to keep on pro­vid­ing high-qual­ity care for the pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Th­ese past months, our roles as HIV physi­cians have con­tin­ued. Re­cently, a young man who had just re­ceived his di­ag­no­sis of</p>
    <p>HIV at a com­mu­nity clinic was re­ferred to me.</p>
    <p>He had been test­ing reg­u­larly for HIV, and at the time he tested pos­i­tive, he was com­pletely asymp­to­matic and felt well. He was seen at our spe­cial­ist HIV clinic within a week of be­ing re­ferred, and af­ter his con­sul­ta­tion and a dis­cus­sion with him, a de­ci­sion was jointly made to start him on treat­ment once his lab­o­ra­tory test re­sults were ready. He has been on med­i­ca­tions for the past four months.</p>
    <p>De­spite the chal­lenges of prac­tis­ing in a Covid-19 world, there was no de­lay in his HIV di­ag­no­sis or treat­ment, as early di­ag­no­sis and ini­ti­a­tion of treat­ment are es­sen­tial to en­sure that peo­ple liv­ing with HIV are able to live healthy, happy lives.</p>
    <p>An­other pa­tient had a dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>She has been liv­ing with HIV for the past 10 years, and has been un­der treat­ment for al­most this en­tire time. Her vi­ral load is un­de­tectable, in­di­cat­ing not only that her HIV is un­der con­trol and she is en­joy­ing good health, but also that she is ef­fec­tively un­able to trans­mit the virus to oth­ers. As she is in her early 60s, we were con­cerned about her pos­si­ble ex­po­sure to Sars-CoV-2 should she have to travel and visit the clinic.</p>
    <p>So ar­range­ments were made for me to see her via tele-con­sul­ta­tion on a video call, dur­ing which I was able to as­cer­tain that she was well and still tak­ing her med­i­ca­tions. She even showed me her new grandson dur­ing the call. I then ar­ranged for her med­i­ca­tions to be de­liv­ered to her home.</p>
    <p>While cir­cum­stances have forced doc­tors to make changes to the way we prac­tise, it has not re­duced the warmth and sense of sat­is­fac­tion all physi­cians feel when we see pa­tients do­ing well.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 and HIV are go­ing to be part of our lives for many years to come. They have changed the way we prac­tise medicine, in­ter­act with one an­other, and live our lives. Through it all, we will weather the storm by hav­ing com­pas­sion for one an­other, tak­ing a sci­en­tif­i­cally-grounded ap­proach, and, of course, hav­ing hope for bet­ter times ahead.</p>
    <p>The stigma sur­round­ing a disease can some­times be more harm­ful and dan­ger­ous than the disease it­self, and over­com­ing the chal­lenges posed by the pan­demic will re­quire a con­certed ef­fort, based on com­pas­sion and rooted in science, as well as the in­volve­ment and par­tic­i­pa­tion of the en­tirety of so­ci­ety.</p>
