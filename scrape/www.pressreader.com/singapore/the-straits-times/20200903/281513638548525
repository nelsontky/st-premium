    <p>Madam Siti Ai­dah Ab­dul­lah’s chil­dren, aged 17 and 15, used to spend hours do­ing their home­work at a Mc­Don­ald’s out­let in Ang Mo Kio be­cause of the free Wi-Fi.</p>
    <p>The mother of five has leukaemia and, when not too sick, would ac­com­pany her chil­dren to make sure they re­mained safe as they tended to stay late into the night.</p>
    <p>On other oc­ca­sions, they would go to the res­i­dents’ com­mit­tee (RC) cen­tre a five-minute walk from their two-room rental flat at Block 244 Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 3.</p>
    <p>Madam Siti, 50, can­not af­ford to pay for an In­ter­net con­nec­tion. She is job­less and has to at­tend reg­u­lar med­i­cal check-ups.</p>
    <p>With the Ke­bun Baru Void Deck WiFi Project set up by the char­ity, Be­yond So­cial Ser­vices, the fam­ily of six now have ac­cess to Wi-Fi closer to their home, at the neigh­bour­ing Block 245.</p>
    <p>Theirs is among 300 low-in­come homes in blocks 244 and 245 that now have In­ter­net ac­cess with the in­stal­la­tion of high-speed fi­bre broad­band at the void deck.</p>
    <p>For Madam Siti, a di­vorcee, the project has brought re­lief for the study ar­range­ments for her chil­dren, who de­pend on the In­ter­net not only for their learn­ing but also for leisure.</p>
    <p>“I used to have broad­band at home un­der my el­dest daugh­ter’s name, but it was cut be­cause of out­stand­ing bills,” she said. “Some­times, I would top up about $10 worth of data on my Sing­tel phone if I can. With the Wi-Fi at the void deck, I know (my chil­dren) are just in the neigh­bour­hood and I can go look for them if I need to.”</p>
    <p>The fam­ily gets by on so­cial ser­vice as­sis­tance for util­i­ties and monthly ex­penses and the in­come Madam Siti’s 19-year-old daugh­ter brings home work­ing as a sales as­sis­tant. She also has a 21-year old in full-time na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Her son, Mo­hamed Shazwan Mo­hamed Awal, 17, is a stu­dent in NorthLight School. He said: “Dur­ing the circuit breaker, I would go back to school for half a day of home-based learn­ing on­line. The Wi-Fi con­nec­tion has made things a lot more con­ve­nient.”</p>
    <p>The project took nearly a year to come to life. Res­i­dents like Madam</p>
    <p>Siti took part in a com­mu­nity con­fer­ence or­gan­ised by Be­yond and Ke­bun Baru Com­mu­nity Club last Sep­tem­ber, where they ex­pressed their as­pi­ra­tions for the com­mu­nity. They put for­ward sug­ges­tions, in­clud­ing the idea of trans­form­ing the void deck into a study and so­cial cor­ner with more seats and ta­bles. That is also in the works, with the cost to be borne by the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>A team of Be­yond vol­un­teers led by lawyer Rebecca Chiu, 34, en­gaged spon­sors and raised funds for the Wi-Fi ini­tia­tive. The project is sup­ported by cor­po­rate part­ners and spon­sors in­clud­ing law firm Allen & Overy, telco M1 and Bridge the Dig­i­tal Di­vide, a cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity ini­tia­tive by dig­i­tal agency Xpointo Media.</p>
    <p>Re­tired odd-job worker Dass Joseph, 65, said he was sur­prised when he found out he had ac­cess to free Wi-Fi nearby. He had missed the no­tices put up to in­form res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr Joseph, who lives with his wife and 27-year-old daugh­ter in Block 245, said he went for weeks with­out us­ing What­sApp af­ter his mo­bile data ran out. He uses the</p>
    <p>mes­sag­ing app to keep in touch with friends and fam­ily. He said: “We can­not af­ford a monthly sub­scrip­tion plan, al­though it would be good to have In­ter­net at home. My daugh­ter, who is study­ing phys­io­ther­apy, re­lied on her mo­bile data hot spot to tele­con­fer­ence from home dur­ing the circuit breaker.”</p>
    <p>He has two other daugh­ters who live on their own and one of them is due to give birth soon.</p>
    <p>He added it would be help­ful if some­one could show him how he could tap the free Wi-Fi at the void deck so he could check on his chil­dren through What­sApp again.</p>
    <p>An­other res­i­dent from Block 245, Mr San Yeow, 65, also said he needed help con­nect­ing to the WiFi at the void deck. The tem­ple helper and his 67-year-old wife do not have Wi-Fi at home.</p>
    <p>He said: “It would be good to use the Wi-Fi down­stairs be­cause then I don’t have to de­pend on my mo­bile data all the time. I could save on my data ex­penses. But I don’t know how to log in, I need some­one to teach me.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chiu said this would be the next step. “The ini­tial re­sponse has been pos­i­tive, but we are mind­ful of how we pro­mote the ser­vice, such as putting no­tices in dif­fer­ent lan­guages and en­cour­ag­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing while surf­ing. The next step is ed­u­cat­ing the res­i­dents on the dig­i­tal lit­er­acy com­po­nent.”</p>
