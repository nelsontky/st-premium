    <p>In a room ded­i­cated to up­ward mo­bil­ity, the aero­space en­gi­neer­ing stu­dent con­tem­plates his as­cent. He looks up at the wall in Boul­der World and fig­ures out the ge­om­e­try of his climb­ing route. He’s so lean he seems built of cords, wires and elas­tic, yet he’s a cousin of weightlift­ers. For like them, he starts work by dip­ping his hands into pow­dered chalk.</p>
    <p>Mark Chan’s chalk is kept in a bag and his hands emerge coated in a film of white dust. Chalk helps his grip and his life de­pends on his grip. Some­times his 57kg frame hangs from a tiny hold which is a few mil­lime­tres wide and he can’t af­ford to fall. He won’t die, just lose.</p>
    <p>Stuck to his bag is a strip of white tape and on it Chan has care­fully writ­ten two words with a marker. In Man­darin it says xi­ang xin; in English it means “be­lieve”.</p>
    <p>“Be­lieve” re­minds him of what he must do, it gives him “hope”, it’s a word which in­spires him on tough days in com­pe­ti­tion “when ev­ery­thing isn’t go­ing as well as it can”.</p>
    <p>Chan, 20, who was Sin­ga­pore’s rep­re­sen­ta­tive at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games (YOG), had bet­ter “be­lieve” be­cause there’s no one else to help him with it. He’s a man ris­ing mostly on his own steam, for as he says “the tough­est part is not hav­ing enough op­por­tu­ni­ties to learn”.</p>
    <p>Maybe West­ern climbers at­tend more in­ter­na­tional events. Maybe they have the con­ve­nience of many, vast climb­ing gyms which can fit all three climb­ing dis­ci­plines – Speed, Boul­der­ing and Lead – into one fa­cil­ity. But what af­fects Chan most in this new Olympic sport, which is en­thu­si­as­ti­cally tak­ing hold in Sin­ga­pore, is the ab­sence of a full-time coach be­side him as he tries to leap from ju­nior tal­ent to se­nior con­tender.</p>
    <p>He won’t whine or cast blame, but qui­etly tells you the cost of this ab­sence. In 2015, he says, his Ja­panese pal Keita Dohi was ranked one place be­low him in boul­der­ing in the Youth B cat­e­gory of the Asian rank­ings, yet by 2018 Dohi had be­come 2018 YOG cham­pion. The Ja­panese may have more gifts, but Chan’s are pos­si­bly un­re­fined. It takes daily tu­tor­ing by a coach to re­lease a tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one needs some­body to make them bet­ter. Luke Sky­walker had Yoda, Plato had Socrates and the Wil­liams sis­ters had their dad. Chan has seen for­eign coaches at work and knows the scale of their knowl­edge. Last year, a Ja­panese coach of an­other ath­lete saw him move on the wall and asked, “Do you have a shoul­der in­jury be­cause you’re over­com­pen­sat­ing?” He was right, but this is pre­cisely the type of ex­pert Chan can’t af­ford.</p>
    <p>At Boul­der World, climbers grab holds, stretch out sinewy legs, and rise like four-limbed spi­ders. They bring the chalk, but coaches are the ones who carry the pol­ish. Some­times, says Chan, you can keep mak­ing the same mis­take for years till some­one points it out.</p>
    <p>When I ask him what a coach could do for him in this daz­zling art of ver­ti­cal prob­lem-solv­ing, he thinks about it overnight, pre­pares a list, and only when he re­cites it does one fig­ure the size of his hand­i­cap.</p>
    <p>The coach, he tells me, erases doubts and “breaks down strat­egy”. If the ath­lete knows he’s been pre­pared well, his con­fi­dence shines. If he goes to an event with­out a coach and sees his ri­val has one, he feels a psy­cho­log­i­cal sting.</p>
    <p>The coach, he says, can read an ath­lete’s mood from a single look, ap­pre­ci­ates the study-sport dilemma and knows how to make lim­ited train­ing ses­sions “pro­duc­tive”. The coach tunes move­ment, lo­cates weak­nesses – Chan says he needs more pure power – and helps set goals that are short-term, longterm and “not too op­ti­mistic”.</p>
    <p>A Ja­panese coach, says Chan, came to work with the Sin­ga­pore team late last year for a few weeks. He has since been locked down in his na­tion but Chan’s ver­ti­cal trav­els con­tinue. Like every ath­lete I met for this se­ries, he chooses pos­i­tiv­ity over com­plaint. Love for a sport over­rides every com­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>I once asked what he loved about climb­ing and he said that when he be­gan at 13 he’d give up eas­ily. “If I couldn’t suc­ceed, I’d stop.” But climb­ing built tenac­ity. “It taught me to be de­ter­mined and I’ve grown as a per­son. In life too, we don’t just achieve any­thing in one go. You keep try­ing.” And so if he can’t get a full-time coach, he’ll just find an­other route to be bet­ter.</p>
    <p>In the early days he’d scroll through in­struc­tional videos on YouTube. Now, he and his team­mates film each other – he has about 1,000 videos on his phone – and slow down the footage and an­a­lyse how they solve hard routes. “We’ve got to make do with what we have.” Days can be ex­haust­ing and yet ac­com­plish­ment is the re­ward. “Even mini-achieve­ments make me happy be­cause it tells me I am im­prov­ing slowly.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing our last chat, I no­tice the pic­ture on his What­sApp ac­count, which is of a younger ver­sion of him­self at a school event. He’s over 40 feet in the air with peo­ple far be­low look­ing up at him. His hands are white with chalk and his smile has no end. It is the joy­ous face of a young man on his way up.</p>
    <p>Stuck to his bag is a strip of white tape and on it Chan has care­fully writ­ten two words with a marker. In Man­darin it says xi­ang xin; in English it means “be­lieve”.</p>
