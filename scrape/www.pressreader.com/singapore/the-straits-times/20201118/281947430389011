    <p>Re­cently, I have no­ticed ad­ver­tise­ments promis­ing to cure var­i­ous vision prob­lems, such as short-sight­ed­ness, long-sight­ed­ness, dif­fi­culty in read­ing, lazy eye and mis­align­ment, on so­cial me­dia and even on ban­ners in heart­land malls.</p>
    <p>The ads fea­ture treatments for chil­dren – cost­ing be­tween $2,000 and $7,000 – and prom­ise to be “non-in­va­sive”.</p>
    <p>Such ads can be found at the top of search en­gine re­sults, and the com­pa­nies may not have any reg­is­tered eye health pro­fes­sion­als like op­ti­cians, op­tometrists or oph­thal­mol­o­gists on their teams.</p>
    <p>I am an op­tometrist and vision sci­en­tist, and have no­ticed that the pro­moted treatments are not ev­i­dence-based or recog­nised by the med­i­cal pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, the firms give un­safe ad­vice to clients, telling them to stop wear­ing their glasses and stop us­ing at­ropine eye drops, usu­ally used to slow the pro­gres­sion of my­opia in chil­dren.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, sev­eral chil­dren suf­fered de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of their vision within six months of start­ing the un­reg­u­lated ther­apy, as shown by hos­pi­tal tests.</p>
    <p>Th­ese chil­dren were also de­prived of func­tional vision for the six months that they were not al­lowed to use their glasses.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent reg­u­la­tion in the Op­tometrists and Op­ti­cians Act does not in­clude clauses on unau­tho­rised per­sons pro­vid­ing eye care ad­vice, ser­vice, at­ten­dance or treat­ment for eye con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>There is also no clin­i­cal guide­line from the Min­istry of Health on the man­age­ment of my­opia.</p>
    <p>Thus, un­eth­i­cal com­pa­nies like th­ese can con­tinue to op­er­ate by get­ting around the reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>More­over, the med­i­cal de­vice used in the ad­ver­tised treatments is not reg­u­lated by the Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>With­out any med­i­cal knowl­edge, par­ents will eas­ily fall prey to such ads, and chil­dren may suf­fer ir­re­versible harm to their vision.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is time the reg­u­la­tions were up­dated to pro­tect vul­ner­a­ble groups like our chil­dren.</p>
