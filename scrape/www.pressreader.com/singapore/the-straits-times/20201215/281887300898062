    <p>Au­toma­tion, ro­bot­ics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nolo­gies have been tak­ing over rou­tine tasks for years. The Covid-19 pan­demic has rapidly in­creased that trend, driven by the triple ne­ces­si­ties of in­creased pro­duc­tiv­ity, lower costs and hu­man safety. Sud­denly, hu­man con­tact is both un­de­sir­able and more longed for than ever.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery com­pa­nies, plumbers and even some med­i­cal providers now boast about their “zero-con­tact” ser­vice, but we rel­ish any chance we get to have an in-per­son meal or a face-to-face meet­ing.</p>
    <p>As we face the fu­ture of an AI econ­omy, 2020 has taught us the im­por­tance of hu­man con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>When I be­gan my ca­reer in AI in 1983, I de­scribed AI in my ap­pli­ca­tion to the PhD pro­gramme at Carnegie Mel­lon Univer­sity as “the quan­tifi­ca­tion of the hu­man think­ing process, the ex­pli­ca­tion of hu­man be­hav­iour” and our “fi­nal step” to un­der­stand­ing our­selves.</p>
    <p>In a way I was wrong, and in a way I was right.</p>
    <p>AI pro­grams are ca­pa­ble of mim­ick­ing and even sur­pass­ing the hu­man brain in many tasks. But if AI al­lows us to truly un­der­stand our­selves, it will be be­cause it lib­er­ates us from the me­chan­i­cal drudgery of rou­tine tasks, and al­lows us to fo­cus on our hu­man­ity and the com­pas­sion­ate con­nec­tions be­tween us.</p>
    <p>We al­ready know that many jobs that are be­ing re­placed will not re­turn, be­cause AI can do them much bet­ter than peo­ple, and at es­sen­tially zero cost. This will gen­er­ate tremen­dous eco­nomic value but will also re­sult in un­prece­dented job dis­place­ment. In my book AI Su­per­pow­ers: China, Sil­i­con Val­ley, And The</p>
    <p>New World Or­der, I es­ti­mated that by 2033, AI and au­toma­tion will be able to do 40 per cent to 50 per cent of our jobs.</p>
    <p>To pre­pare now for the mil­lions of dis­placed jobs and tackle re­train­ing for the new skills re­quired when AI is both a co-worker and a tool, I pro­pose the 3Rs – re­learn, re­cal­i­brate and re­nais­sance – as part of a gar­gan­tuan reimag­i­na­tion of how we live and work to deal with the cen­tral eco­nomic is­sue of our time: the AI revo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>RE­LEARN­ING</p>
    <p>First, and per­haps eas­i­est, is fore­warn­ing peo­ple in en­dan­gered jobs and es­tab­lish­ing pro­grammes for them to re­learn their fields in the con­text of AI. The good news is that there are plenty of “hu­man” skills that AI can­not master: cre­ativ­ity, so­cial in­ter­ac­tion, phys­i­cally com­plex or dex­ter­ous work and, of course, us­ing the AI tools that need hu­man op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Vo­ca­tional schools need to re­design their cur­ric­ula to in­crease cour­ses for sus­tain­able jobs. Govern­ments could take the lead and pro­vide in­cen­tives and sub­si­dies for those cour­ses, rather than blindly pur­su­ing broad-brush eco­nomic mea­sures like uni­ver­sal ba­sic in­come.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­ra­tions could also pro­vide pro­grammes like Ama­zon’s Ca­reer Choice scheme, which pays up to US$12,000 (S$16,000) an­nu­ally over four years for the com­pany’s hourly-rated em­ploy­ees to earn de­grees in high-de­mand oc­cu­pa­tions such as air­craft me­chan­ics, com­puter-aided de­sign and nurs­ing.</p>
    <p>Pan­demic or no pan­demic, the im­por­tance and num­ber of hu­man-cen­tric ser­vice jobs, such as nurs­ing, will grow as wealth and life spans in­crease.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion pre­dicts that by 2030, we will fall short of the num­ber of healthcare work­ers re­quired to achieve the United Na­tions Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment Goal of “good health and well-be­ing for all” by ap­prox­i­mately 18 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>There is an acute need to re­assess such vi­tal, yet un­der­val­ued, hu­man-cen­tric ser­vice roles both in terms of how they are per­ceived and how much they are paid. Th­ese jobs will form the bedrock for the new AI econ­omy.</p>
    <p>RE­CAL­I­BRA­TION</p>
    <p>As we pre­pare peo­ple for the even­tual tran­si­tion to an AI-driven econ­omy, we will also need to re­cal­i­brate many of to­day’s jobs. Like soft­ware did a few decades ago, AI can aug­ment hu­mans’ creative think­ing with a com­puter’s re­lent­less abil­ity to churn through masses of data, hy­poth­e­sise al­ter­na­tives or op­ti­mise out­comes.</p>
    <p>There will not be a sin­gle, generic AI tool, but spe­cific tools cus­tomised for each pro­fes­sion and ap­pli­ca­tion. We may have an AI-based mol­e­cule gen­er­a­tion pro­gram for drug re­searchers, an AI ad­ver­tis­ing plan­ner for mar­keters or an AI fact-checker for jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>Merg­ing AI op­ti­mi­sa­tion and the hu­man touch will rein­vent many jobs and cre­ate even more. AI will take care of rou­tine tasks in tan­dem with hu­mans, who will carry out the tasks that re­quire, well, hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, fu­ture doc­tors will still be a pa­tient’s pri­mary point of con­tact, but they will rely on AI di­ag­nos­tic tools to de­ter­mine the best treat­ment. This will re­di­rect the doc­tor’s role into that of a com­pas­sion­ate care­giver, giv­ing him more time with his pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Just as the mo­bile In­ter­net led to roles like the Uber driver, the com­ing of AI will cre­ate jobs we can­not even con­ceive of yet. Ex­am­ples to­day in­clude AI en­gi­neers, data sci­en­tists, data-la­bellers and ro­bot me­chan­ics. We should watch for the emer­gence of such roles, make peo­ple aware of them and pro­vide train­ing for them.</p>
    <p>RE­NAIS­SANCE</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, just as the wealthy Ital­ian cities and mer­chants funded their coun­try’s Re­nais­sance, we must hope that AI will in­spire a re­nais­sance of its own. With ma­chines tak­ing over many du­ties and tasks in the new econ­omy, AI will in­ject flex­i­bil­ity into tra­di­tional work­ing pat­terns, al­low­ing us to re­think what work-life bal­ance should look like, and trans­form­ing both the week­day rou­tine and re­tire­ment thresh­olds.</p>
    <p>With more free­dom and time in such a new so­cial con­tract, peo­ple will be lib­er­ated to fol­low their pas­sions, cre­ativ­ity and tal­ent, and to let that per­sonal ex­plo­ration in­form their ca­reers as never be­fore. Painters, sculp­tors and pho­tog­ra­phers will be able to use AI tools to compose, ex­per­i­ment, enu­mer­ate and re­fine their art­work. Nov­el­ists, jour­nal­ists and po­ets will use new tech­nolo­gies to take their writing in pre­vi­ously un­thought-of di­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tors, freed from the drudgery of grad­ing and pa­per­work, can fi­nally un­leash their en­ergy to de­sign lessons that en­cour­age cu­rios­ity, crit­i­cal think­ing and cre­ativ­ity. AI pro­grams can help teach facts and fig­ures so that teach­ers can spend more time de­vel­op­ing stu­dents’ emo­tional in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>The three Rs will rep­re­sent an un­par­al­leled un­der­tak­ing for hu­man­ity. Com­pa­nies will need to re­train a mas­sive num­ber of dis­placed work­ers. Govern­ments must raise an as­tro­nom­i­cal amount of money and re­dis­tribute it to fund this tran­si­tion. Schools need to rein­vent ed­u­ca­tion to pro­duce creative, so­cial and mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary grad­u­ates. Ev­ery­thing must be re­de­fined: the work ethic of so­ci­ety, en­ti­tle­ments for cit­i­zens, re­spon­si­bil­i­ties for cor­po­ra­tions and the role of govern­ments.</p>
    <p>In all of this, the role of AI tech­nolo­gies is cru­cial. If we do it right, AI will free us to em­brace not only our cre­ativ­ity and com­pas­sion for one an­other, but also our hu­man­ity.</p>
