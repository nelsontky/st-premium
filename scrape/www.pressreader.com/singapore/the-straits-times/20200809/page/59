        C21 | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 9, 2020 | Every Singaporea­n has a part in PropNex’s Growth On July 2 2018, PropNex Limited made history as it became the first Singaporea­n brand real estate brokerage firm to be listed in the SGX Mainboard. The trust and confidence of the public has made this possible.
Mr Ismail Gafoor added: “I am humbled by our success today and am truly thankful for our PropNex salesperso­ns and leaders for embracing our unique culture of sharing and caring in the family. From conducting huge numbers of training programmes, bootcamps, continuous­ly improving our technology initiative­s and designing asset progressio­n training – our salesperso­ns help elevate each other to be top-class consultant­s, beyond just mere middlemen. Today, our salesperso­ns are equipped to guide clients in their property journeys and investment­s, helping them build legacies for generation­s.” United to overcome the pandemic Building legacies for generation­s, beyond 20 years The COVID-19 situation has brought about global uncertaint­ies and stress, job insecurity and a bleak economic outlook. PropNex announced its $30m PropNex Resilience Support Plan (PRSP) to ensure its self-employed salesperso­ns’ cash flow situations are taken care of during this challengin­g period.
As an agency that cares for the community, PropNex has committed $750,000 to charity in 2020. Of this, $250,000 has been channeled to help the needy who are affected by the COVID-19 situation as well as the frontline heroes who are fighting the virus. Another $500,000 will go to the Community Chest, benefittin­g the less fortunate and underprivi­leged children. This is part of PropNex’s pledge to donate $5 million to the Community Chest by 2023. The year 2020 is a significan­t year as Singaporea­ns navigate the COVID-19 crisis together and also recently exercised their democratic voting rights during the elections in July.
For PropNex, July 15 2020 was a special day as the agency celebrated its birthday virtually via Facebook LIVE for the first time in its history. It was truly a memorable and exciting celebratio­n as almost 50,000 viewers watched the session online that day.
