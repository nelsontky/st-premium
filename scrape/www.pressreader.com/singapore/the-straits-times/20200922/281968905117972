    <p>Lib­er­als love to blame Mil­ton Fried­man for the mis­be­haviour of Amer­i­can cor­po­ra­tions. The late econ­o­mist, a free-market ide­o­logue, pub­lished an es­say 50 years ago last week in The Times Mag­a­zine in which he ar­gued that cor­po­ra­tions should not go beyond the let­ter of the law to com­bat dis­crim­i­na­tion or re­duce pol­lu­tion or main­tain community in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­ra­tions, he said, have no so­cial re­spon­si­bil­i­ties ex­cept the sa­cred re­spon­si­bil­ity to make money. The es­say was a big hit with the ex­ec­u­tive class. Rich peo­ple were only too de­lighted to see self­ish­ness por­trayed as a prin­ci­pled stand.</p>
    <p>Fried­man’s creed be­came the stan­dard jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for cor­po­rate cal­lous­ness. Lead­ing lobby group, the Busi­ness Round­table, de­clared in 1997 that max­imis­ing profit was a cor­po­ra­tion’s pur­pose. Crit­ics have been fight­ing ever since to get cor­po­ra­tions to ac­knowl­edge broader re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. It’s the wrong bat­tle.</p>
    <p>In­stead of redefining the role of the cor­po­ra­tion, we need to re­de­fine the role of the state.</p>
    <p>Fried­man’s es­say was part of his broader cam­paign to re­vive faith in the power of mar­kets. He and his in­tel­lec­tual al­lies ar­gued that if cor­po­ra­tions fo­cused on mak­ing money, and gov­ern­ment got out of the way, the econ­omy would grow and every­one would ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>For decades, pol­i­cy­mak­ers have em­braced his ad­vice. They have slashed taxes; sought to un­der­mine unions; and re­duced some kinds of reg­u­la­tion, notably in fi­nan­cial mar­kets. Reg­u­la­tors made it eas­ier for com­pa­nies to shovel money to share­hold­ers by re­pur­chas­ing their own shares, and busi­nesses in­creas­ingly com­pen­sated their ex­ec­u­tives with shares, align­ing their fi­nan­cial in­ter­ests with those of the firm’s other share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>It’s been an ex­per­i­ment on a grand scale, and the re­sults are de­press­ingly clear.</p>
    <p>Growth has slowed, and much of the avail­able gains have been pock­eted by a small mi­nor­ity of very wealthy Amer­i­cans. The share­hold­ing class keeps get­ting richer; the rest of the na­tion is fall­ing be­hind.</p>
    <p>There is an air of des­per­a­tion about the in­ces­sant ef­forts to ad­dress these prob­lems by jaw­bon­ing cor­po­ra­tions to be bet­ter cit­i­zens: the plead­ing with Facebook to take re­spon­si­bil­ity for the filth it pub­lishes; the cam­paigns to per­suade banks to steal less money from cus­tomers; the pub­lic sham­ing of restau­rants that refuse to give paid leave to sick em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>There may be some value in chal­leng­ing ex­ec­u­tives who are care­ful to tip their waiters well, who re­li­ably put wa­ter bot­tles into re­cy­cling bins, who think of them­selves as com­mit­ted to so­cial jus­tice, to bring those val­ues to the of­fice. But prom­ises are cheap, and cor­po­ra­tions are likely to aban­don benev­o­lence dur­ing down­turns – just when it’s needed most.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust last year, with great fan­fare, the Busi­ness Round­table re­vised its state­ment about the pur­pose of cor­po­ra­tions, ac­knowl­edg­ing obli­ga­tions to em­ploy­ees, sup­pli­ers and the broader community.</p>
    <p>But As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tyler Wry of the Univer­sity of Penn­syl­va­nia found that com­pa­nies that had signed the Busi­ness Round­table state­ment were more likely than other big firms to an­nounce lay­offs in the early months of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – even as they paid out more money to share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment re­mains the most pow­er­ful means to express our col­lec­tive will. The nec­es­sary so­lu­tion is to cre­ate stronger in­cen­tives for good be­hav­iour and laws against bad be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>In­stead of urg­ing power firms to burn less fos­sil fuel, tax car­bon emis­sions. In­stead of plead­ing with McDonald’s to raise wages, raise the fed­eral min­i­mum wage. In­stead of sham­ing Ama­zon for squeez­ing small firms, en­force an­titrust laws.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment also needs to do more to sup­port eco­nomic growth. Fried­man’s neg­a­tive vi­sion of gov­ern­ment has helped to ob­scure the ways the pub­lic sec­tor can help the pri­vate sec­tor, for ex­am­ple by in­vest­ing in ed­u­ca­tion, in­fra­struc­ture and re­search.</p>
    <p>The out­size po­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence of cor­po­ra­tions – and of those made wealthy by them – is cer­tainly one rea­son for the widen­ing gap be­tween what the law re­quires and what many Amer­i­cans would like the law to re­quire. But there is no sense in waiting for cor­po­ra­tions to dis­arm vol­un­tar­ily. The rules must be changed, and the process be­gins at the bal­lot box.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­ra­tions have a valu­able role to play in so­ci­ety, and they con­trib­ute pri­mar­ily by try­ing to make money. Fried­man’s nar­row point is mostly cor­rect. The miss­ing part is the role of gov­ern­ment in en­sur­ing those prof­its do not come at the ex­pense of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mist Robert Solow once ob­served that when he lis­tened to his lib­eral col­league John Ken­neth Gal­braith com­plain­ing about the flaws of mar­kets, he found him­self re­minded of the virtues. When he lis­tened to Fried­man, by con­trast, he was re­minded of the flaws. Af­ter 50 years of lis­ten­ing to Fried­man, it’s time to do some­thing about the flaws.</p>
