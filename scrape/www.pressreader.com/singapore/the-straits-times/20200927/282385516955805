    <p>Volatile, un­cer­tain, com­plex and am­bigu­ous – the acro­nym Vuca is a buzz­word bandied about in man­age­ment cir­cles, but it aptly de­scribes par­ent­ing dur­ing the pan­demic too, say the ex­perts in an up­com­ing event.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture we thought would hap­pen is now our present. As a par­ent, it means that all the more we have to em­power our chil­dren with the nec­es­sary mind­set and tools to be able to re­main adapt­able in the face of such mas­sive change,” says Ms Sha-En Yeo, 39, an expert in pos­i­tive psy­chol­ogy who runs a con­sul­tancy called Hap­pi­ness Sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of buck­ling down on fear, we can use the pan­demic as a huge teach­ing and learn­ing op­por­tu­nity for our chil­dren,” adds the mother of two chil­dren aged 11 and six.</p>
    <p>She is one of six pan­el­lists who will be par­tic­i­pat­ing in an on­line fire­side chat ti­tled Par­ent­ing In A Vuca World on Saturday.</p>
    <p>The event is or­gan­ised by the Asia In­sti­tute of Men­tor­ing, which aims to build a men­tor­ing com­mu­nity across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo and other pan­el­lists share some of the strate­gies that work for them.</p>
    <p>1 PUT ON YOUR OXY­GEN MASK FIRST</p>
    <p>“Safety in­struc­tions on aero­planes in­sist we put our own oxy­gen mask on first be­fore as­sist­ing oth­ers. Like­wise, as par­ents, if we are not phys­i­cally, men­tally and emo­tion­ally well, we will not be able to care for the well-be­ing of our loved ones,” says Ms Zer­lina Sim, 47, a lead­er­ship and mind­ful­ness coach who is direc­tor of Po­ten­tial Project Sin­ga­pore, a lead­er­ship, or­gan­i­sa­tional de­vel­op­ment and re­search firm.</p>
    <p>While some par­ents may feel they have to put on a brave face, the mother of three chil­dren aged 13 to 16 points out that “height­ened anx­i­ety and pro­longed stress not only re­duce men­tal ef­fec­tive­ness, but are also likely to cause men­tal health and emo­tional prob­lems”.</p>
    <p>She rec­om­mends that par­ents take a short pause dur­ing the day to check on their feel­ings in an hon­est rather than crit­i­cal way and re­mind them­selves that they are not alone in their strug­gles.</p>
    <p>Even if they are pressed for time, five to 10 min­utes a day prac­tis­ing mind­ful­ness will help them cul­ti­vate a re­silient mind­set, she adds.</p>
    <p>If they feel over­whelmed, they should not feel guilty about reach­ing out to friends, fam­ily or com­mu­nity helplines for sup­port.</p>
    <p>2 SHARE YOUR STRUG­GLES, BUT LIS­TEN TO THEIRS TOO</p>
    <p>Many par­ents feel lost and do not know how to talk about the pan­demic with their kids, Ms Yeo notes.</p>
    <p>“In times of change, be­ing able to talk through and share how they feel is re­ally im­por­tant for chil­dren, or else they will come to all kinds of con­clu­sions or be swayed by what they read on the In­ter­net,” she says.</p>
    <p>Par­ents’ fears could also be­come their chil­dren’s fears as they in­ter­nalise the ac­tions and feel­ings of adults around them.</p>
    <p>“How we re­spond to this sit­u­a­tion is a model for how they would re­spond should chal­lenges come their way,” she adds.</p>
    <p>When chil­dren share their strug­gles, Ms Sim sug­gests that par­ents use phys­i­cal cues such as touch­ing their lips to re­mind them­selves not to in­ter­rupt or rest­ing a fin­ger un­der their ear to stay at­ten­tive.</p>
    <p>“Try not to ig­nore, judge or dis­miss what your child is ex­press­ing. Once we fully un­der­stand, only then can we help them find so­lu­tions,” she says.</p>
    <p>Par­ents should also be mind­ful that teenagers, in par­tic­u­lar, “pre­fer to be un­der­stood, not judged, and sup­ported rather than di­rected”.</p>
    <p>3 EM­POWER KIDS TO HELP THEM­SELVES</p>
    <p>In­stead of over-sched­ul­ing ac­tiv­i­ties for her five chil­dren aged three to 14 dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, Ms Junia Tan, 42, gave them space to grow re­spon­si­bly.</p>
    <p>The con­scious par­ent­ing coach set phys­i­cal and time bound­aries so that she could work un­in­ter­rupted dur­ing cer­tain hours, while her chil­dren played, baked or did their home­work.</p>
    <p>“I was not re­spon­si­ble for keep­ing them oc­cu­pied. They were re­spon­si­ble for what they chose to do with their time,” she says. “That au­ton­omy meant they grew in learn</p>
    <p>ing how to be accountabl­e as we checked in dur­ing meal­times.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, par­ents can en­cour­age their kids to be re­source­ful when­ever they face prob­lems, says Ms Delphine Ang, 47, a youth lead­er­ship and youth men­tor coach.</p>
    <p>While rush­ing to solve prob­lems for them seems to be a faster way out, it in­creases chil­dren’s re­liance on adults, who are al­ready over­stretched in the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>En­trust kids with plan­ning fam­ily bond­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, adds Ms Ang, who has four chil­dren aged six months to 18 years old.</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren are very cre­ative and they would ap­pre­ci­ate an op­por­tu­nity to be in charge.”</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, par­ents should re­mind them­selves that the pan­demic is not “nor­mal” and let go of pre­vi­ous ex­pec­ta­tions of them­selves and their chil­dren, Ms Sim says.</p>
    <p>“Pro­vid­ing un­con­di­tional love, ful­fill­ing ba­sic needs and en­sur­ing a child feels emo­tion­ally safe might be all we should aim for at this time.</p>
    <p>“Shar­ing love, laugh­ter and small mo­ments of joy costs noth­ing. Ev­ery­thing else can wait.”</p>
    <p>Go to str.sg/JBSb to reg­is­ter for the Par­ent­ing In A Vuca World fire­side chat on Saturday.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan is also or­gan­is­ing an on­line Mums’ Space Sum­mit from Oct 12 to 16, which will in­clude topics on par­ent­ing. Reg­is­ter at mumspace.asia/LP</p>
