    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­ported five new cases of Covid-19 yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 58,260.</p>
    <p>All five cases were im­ported, and had been placed on stay­home no­tice when they ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore. There were no lo­cal cases.</p>
    <p>Among the new cases are four who were not show­ing any symp­toms and were de­tected through proac­tive screen­ing and sur­veil­lance.</p>
    <p>One of them is a woman from In­done­sia who is mar­ry­ing a Sin­ga­porean and is here for her wed­ding.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old holds a short­term visit pass and is a con­tact of two pre­vi­ous im­ported cases from In­done­sia – a 41-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man who are both also here for short-term vis­its.</p>
    <p>Three of the other cases were also asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>They are two women from In­done­sia – a 35-year-old and a 41-year-old who are work per­mit hold­ers and em­ployed here – as well as a 21-year-old man from Bri­tain who is the son of a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The last among the five cases is a 28-year-old woman who came from the United States. The de­pen­dant’s pass holder started show­ing symp­toms last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health said yes­ter­day that epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are be­ing car­ried out.</p>
    <p>All close con­tacts of the cases who have been iden­ti­fied have been iso­lated and placed in quar­an­tine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod so that in­fec­tions can be picked up even if they are not show­ing any symp­toms.</p>
    <p>They will also have to un­dergo sero­log­i­cal tests, which can de­ter­mine if a per­son has ever been in­fected by the coro­n­avirus even if they are cur­rently not in­fected.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low with a to­tal of three cases in the past week, of which two are cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 71 ac­tive cases of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, with 44 pa­tients in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties and 27 pa­tients in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has seen 29 deaths from com­pli­ca­tions aris­ing from Covid-19, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, more than 67 mil­lion peo­ple have been in­fected by the coro­n­avirus, and about 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple have died from the disease.</p>
