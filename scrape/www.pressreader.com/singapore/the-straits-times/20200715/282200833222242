    <p>There is room for im­prove­ment in the qual­ity of fi­nan­cial state­ments is­sued by Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies, the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity (Acra) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Sin­ga­pore-listed com­pa­nies that did not re­ceive clean au­dit opin­ions jumped to 51, or 9 per cent, for an­nual fi­nan­cial state­ments filed for 2018, it noted. This was up from 35, or 6 per cent, for 2016 re­ports.</p>
    <p>But the num­ber of com­pa­nies with five or more ar­eas qual­i­fied or dis­claimed fell from seven for 2016 to five for 2018.</p>
    <p>A qual­i­fied opin­ion is i ssued when the au­di­tor is un­able to con­duct the au­dit prop­erly or when there is a dis­agree­ment with man­age­ment on is­sues such as the ap­pli­ca­tion of ac­count­ing stan­dards.</p>
    <p>The lack of deep knowl­edge and due care by pre­par­ers and di­rec­tors were root causes be­hind ma­te­rial non-com­pli­ances with ac­count­ing stan­dards, Acra said.</p>
    <p>“With ris­ing eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, com­pa­nies are un­der pres­sure to... de­liver fi­nan­cial sus­tain­abil­ity,” it noted.</p>
    <p>“It is cru­cial for the board to put in place a strong cul­ture of cor­po­rate gov­er­nance, and to ap­ply rigour when re­view­ing and ap­prov­ing fi­nan­cial state­ments, to en­sure that (these) pro­vide an ac­cu­rate pic­ture of the com­pany’s fi­nan­cial standing.”</p>
    <p>Acra an­a­lysed the 2016 fi­nan­cial state­ments filed by 584 listed com­pa­nies and found that 94 per cent, or 549 firms, re­ceived clean au­dit opin­ions.</p>
    <p>It called this an “en­cour­ag­ing sign” as it means most share­hold­ers had ac­cess to re­li­able fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Acra also scru­ti­nised po­ten­tial ma­te­rial non-com­pli­ances iden­ti­fied in se­lected 2016, 2017 and 2018 fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>It found that 35 state­ments re­ceived mod­i­fied au­dit re­ports, with 95 ar­eas qual­i­fied or dis­claimed by statu­tory au­di­tors.</p>
    <p>Most were re­lated to the im­pair­ment of as­sets, go­ing con­cern as­sump­tions and lim­i­ta­tions im­posed on the scope of au­dits.</p>
    <p>A re­view of 20 fi­nan­cial state­ments, in­clud­ing 19 listed com­pa­nies and one non-listed, found that 11 con­tained a to­tal of 31 ma­te­rial non-com­pli­ances with ac­count­ing stan­dards.</p>
    <p>One-third of these re­sulted in ad­just­ments to the re­ported re­sults.</p>
    <p>Four listed com­pa­nies rec­ti­fied the non-com­pli­ances by reau­dit­ing their past years’ fi­nan­cial state­ments. Two other listed com­pa­nies did rec­ti­fi­ca­tions by mak­ing ad­di­tional dis­clo­sures, among other things, in their 2018 and 2019 fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>These rec­ti­fi­ca­tions have pro­vided stake­hold­ers with more re­li­able fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion to make de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Acra found that the non-com­pli­ances were due to a “lack of deep knowl­edge among the fi­nance teams, chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cers and au­dit com­mit­tees”, which led to an in­cor­rect ap­pli­ca­tion of ac­count­ing stan­dards.</p>
    <p>“This be­comes more chal­leng­ing when the ac­count­ing mat­ters are com­plex and in­volve spe­cialised ar­eas such as busi­ness val­u­a­tions and im­pair­ment as­sess­ments.”</p>
    <p>A lack of due care by the fi­nance team, chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cers and au­dit com­mit­tees was an­other prob­lem. “There were in­stances where di­rec­tors failed to pick up un­re­al­is­tic op­er­at­ing cash-flow fig­ures, which sug­gested in­ad­e­quate at­ten­tion paid to this im­por­tant state­ment.</p>
    <p>“When ap­point­ing the au­dit com­mit­tee, the board should en­sure there is a right mix of mem­bers pos­sess­ing the ap­pro­pri­ate skills in ac­count­ing and au­dit­ing.”</p>
    <p>It should also “pro­vide guid­ance and sup­port to the au­dit com­mit­tee, in­clud­ing al­low­ing ac­cess to ex­perts and con­sul­tants for ad­vice on more com­plex ar­eas”.</p>
