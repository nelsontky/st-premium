    <p>As we cross the thresh­old into a new year, un­cer­tainty is rife as the Covid-19 cri­sis lingers. The ar­rival of vac­cines brings hope but the eco­nomic havoc wrought by the virus con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>Go­ing by num­bers alone, the pic­ture looks grim. Go­ing by the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try forecast, Sin­ga­pore’s GDP would have shrunk by 6 to 6.5 per cent by the end of last year. Given that the pop­u­la­tion has de­clined by an es­ti­mated 0.3 per cent last year, GDP per capita (a mea­sure of av­er­age in­comes) would have de­clined by 5.7 to 6.2 per cent. This, in turn, points to a size­able de­cline in our stan­dard of liv­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is also an es­tab­lished fact that GDP per capita is an im­per­fect mea­sure of well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Even though Vic­to­rian his­to­rian Thomas Car­lyle has la­belled eco­nomics the “dis­mal sci­ence”, we would like to do our bit to lift the gloom by high­light­ing some as­pects of well-be­ing that are not cap­tured in GDP fig­ures but have stood out to us in the past year.</p>
    <p>In con­tem­plat­ing these al­ter­na­tive met­rics, con­sider some high­lights from then United States pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Robert Kennedy’s fa­mous re­marks at the Univer­sity of Kansas in 1968 when he spoke elo­quently of the lim­i­ta­tions of tra­di­tional eco­nomic yard­sticks as a mea­sure of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“(GDP) mea­sures… nei­ther our com­pas­sion nor our de­vo­tion to our coun­try.”</p>
    <p>GDP mea­sures the value of a coun­try’s pro­duc­tion of goods and ser­vices. How­ever, only goods and ser­vices that are trans­acted in the mar­ket are in­cluded. This means that the ser­vices of our vol­un­teers are not re­flected in the GDP num­bers even though they clearly im­prove our col­lec­tive well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Prior to the pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore’s vol­un­teer par­tic­i­pa­tion rate had gen­er­ally been ris­ing. While the pan­demic has led to a set­back in num­bers, it is heart­en­ing to come across many heart­warm­ing anec­dotes of peo­ple who have taken the ini­tia­tive to help oth­ers in these dif­fi­cult times and in the face of in­creased risk of ex­po­sure to the virus.</p>
    <p>Some ex­am­ples in­clude Engi­neer­ing Good’s Com­put­ers Against Covid pro­gramme that re­fur­bished old lap­tops for dis­tri­bu­tion to stu­dents who needed them for home-based learn­ing, and in­creased food dis­tri­bu­tion by vol­un­teers from food char­i­ties such as Food Bank, Food From The Heart, Free Food For All and Will­ing Hearts.</p>
    <p>It is not only the quan­tity of the vol­un­teer hours that count. The in­trin­sic value of the ser­vices mat­ters too. While no mar­ket price on vol­un­teer­ing ser­vices ex­ists for us to ob­serve a change in their value, it is not a stretch to ar­gue that in more trou­bled times, such ser­vices are more ap­pre­ci­ated and there­fore more valu­able.</p>
    <p>The tech­ni­cal ar­gu­ment is that on the ben­e­fits side, the in­creased de­mand for such ser­vices re­flects an in­creased value placed on them, whereas on the cost side, there is lit­tle rea­son for op­por­tu­nity costs to have in­creased (if any­thing, higher un­em­ploy­ment and fewer leisure op­tions should trans­late into lower op­por­tu­nity costs due to more lim­ited al­ter­na­tive uses of time). The com­bi­na­tion of higher so­cial ben­e­fits from vol­un­teer­ing and lower op­por­tu­nity costs in pro­vid­ing them means that the net so­cial ben­e­fit from each hour of vol­un­teer­ing has in­creased.</p>
    <p>“It counts the de­struc­tion of the red­wood and the loss of our nat­u­ral won­der in chaotic sprawl.”</p>
    <p>Con­tin­u­ing in the vein of ap­pre­ci­at­ing life beyond the GDP fig­ures, we high­light the pos­i­tive en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact from hu­man­ity hit­ting the pause but­ton as we headed to­wards var­i­ous forms of lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the shut­ting of fac­to­ries and sharp drop in traf­fic have re­duced emis­sions and hence con­trib­uted to an im­proved air qual­ity. Data vi­su­al­i­sa­tions from Nasa have shown dra­matic re­duc­tions in air pol­lu­tants across ma­jor ci­ties dur­ing lock­downs. Lo­cally, the re­duced grass cut­ting dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker al­lowed us to ob­serve a greater abun­dance of wild­flow­ers and the as­so­ci­ated wildlife such as but­ter­flies and drag­on­flies. The slightly less man­i­cured green­ery was a re­fresh­ing sight for some who value na­ture as it is.</p>
    <p>While we are by no means prop­a­gat­ing lock­downs as a way to solve our en­vi­ron­men­tal prob­lems and are not naive to believe that the gains over the last year are per­ma­nent, we hope the re­newed ap­pre­ci­a­tion for na­ture will gal­vanise po­lit­i­cal will to­wards reimag­in­ing a less fos­sil fuel-in­ten­sive fu­ture in which man and na­ture can co­ex­ist more peace­fully.</p>
    <p>At the in­ter­na­tional level, the</p>
    <p>Paris Agree­ment, de­spite its mixed re­sults at the five-year mark, re­mains our best bet for co­or­di­nated and sus­tained global ac­tion to­wards net zero emis­sions. Mr Don­ald Trump’s de­par­ture from the White House of­fers hope that the US, a ma­jor car­bon emit­ter, would be more sup­port­ive of the en­vi­ron­men­tal agenda.</p>
    <p>Within Sin­ga­pore, ef­forts to fur­ther in­te­grate na­ture and en­ergy-ef­fi­cient de­sign into our liv­ing spa­ces are also on the right track, with thought-through mea­sures for re­duc­ing an over-re­liance on fos­sil fu­els, and the need to find al­ter­na­tive em­ploy­ment for those em­ployed in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>An overly nar­row fo­cus on GDP ef­fec­tively places a value of zero on the im­prove­ment to our liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment. How­ever, as our ex­pe­ri­ence last year has shown, the beauty of na­ture plays an im­por­tant role in our phys­i­cal and men­tal well­ness.</p>
    <p>“It mea­sures nei­ther our wit nor our courage, nei­ther our wis­dom nor our learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>GDP also does not mea­sure the re­silience of our peo­ple. A sil­ver lin­ing of the pan­demic is how it has sur­faced the “kam­pung spirit” of our com­mu­nity. Many peo­ple do­nated their $600 Sol­i­dar­ity pay­outs back in April, with giv­ing plat­forms re­ceiv­ing more than $140,000 in do­na­tions in a mat­ter of days. Oth­ers started pos­i­tive chain re­ac­tions by plac­ing hand sani­tiser, masks and other med­i­cal sup­plies in com­mon ar­eas with the call for peo­ple to take what they need and pay it for­ward by con­tribut­ing sup­plies that they have in sur­plus.</p>
    <p>While the mon­e­tary value of do­mes­ti­cally pro­duced com­po­nents of the do­nated sup­plies may be counted in the GDP, the spirit be­hind it is not.</p>
    <p>And it is this spirit that adds to our well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, GDP cap­tures the mon­e­tary value of the health­care and other es­sen­tial ser­vices pro­vided by our front-line work­ers but not the value of their courage nor their in­ge­nu­ity in adapt­ing and learn­ing new ways of do­ing their jobs when the en­vi­ron­ment has com­pletely changed.</p>
    <p>“It mea­sures ev­ery­thing in short, ex­cept that which makes life worth­while.”</p>
    <p>As econ­o­mists, we do think GDP is use­ful, of course, but as a mea­sure of eco­nomic pro­duc­tion, not a mea­sure of peo­ple’s well-be­ing. When it comes to well-be­ing, while jobs and in­comes are cer­tainly im­por­tant, we must not lose sight of other things that mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back at the year just past, we are grate­ful for the com­pas­sion and ser­vices of our vol­un­teers, the clean and green en­vi­ron­ment we live in, and the courage and re­silience of fel­low mem­bers in our com­mu­nity. It is our hope that as we look for­ward to an eco­nomic re­cov­ery this year, we con­tinue to care for one an­other and our en­vi­ron­ment, and value what truly mat­ters.</p>
