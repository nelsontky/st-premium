    <p>A STU­DENT, post­ing on Twit­ter as South Korea’s most no­to­ri­ous child rapist was re­leased from jail yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s most no­to­ri­ous child rapist was pelted with eggs by an an­gry crowd who called for him to be cas­trated when he was re­leased from prison yes­ter­day af­ter serv­ing 12 years be­hind bars.</p>
    <p>Some 150 pro­test­ers turned up when Cho Doo-soon, 68, ar­rived at his home in An­san city, south-west of Seoul, with some 100 po­lice of­fi­cers dis­patched to main­tain or­der and keep him safe.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents, ac­tivists and YouTu­bers shouted “ex­e­cute him”, “cas­trate him” and “ex­pel him from An­san” as Cho got out of a car, es­corted by pa­role of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic out­rage still runs high against the grey-haired man, who bru­tally raped and mu­ti­lated an eight-year-old girl in 2008 but was given a lighter sen­tence for hav­ing com­mit­ted the crime un­der the in­flu­ence of al­co­hol – a le­git­i­mate de­fence in South Korea.</p>
    <p>Prose­cu­tors had pressed then for him to be given a life sen­tence. Cho had 17 other crim­i­nal con­vic­tions since 1972, from ex­tor­tion and theft to rape and as­sault.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic cried foul when the court de­cided on a 12-year jail term.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim was walk­ing to school on the morn­ing of Dec 11, 2008, when she was kid­napped by Cho and dragged to a toi­let in a nearby church.</p>
    <p>He stran­gled her, beat her un­til she was un­con­scious, and then raped her in var­i­ous ways.</p>
    <p>He also tor­tured her, caus­ing se­vere dam­age to her lower or­gans, and left her to die af­ter try­ing to drown her in wa­ter. The girl sur­vived the at­tack, af­ter un­der­go­ing surgery for eight hours.</p>
    <p>The po­lice quickly ar­rested Cho, who was found with her blood on his clothes and shoes.</p>
    <p>But he in­sisted he did not re­mem­ber any­thing as he was drunk. He wrote “I am not a sick mon­ster who rapes an eight-year-old girl” 300 times in his de­fence.</p>
    <p>The po­lice called him “a bald­faced liar”.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic fury erupted when his 12-year jail term was meted out.</p>
    <p>House­wife Sarah Kim, 44, re­calls “feel­ing shocked to the core” when she read the news back then.</p>
    <p>“My daugh­ter was also eight years old then and I couldn’t help but think, what if the same thing hap­pened to her?” she told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“This coun­try is re­ally no place for women to live, there’s too much gen­der bias against us... Just the thought of it makes me an­gry.”</p>
    <p>The case was adapted into an award-win­ning movie named Hope, which drew 2.67 mil­lion view­ers in 2013.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists re­fused to back down, fil­ing thou­sands of pe­ti­tions over the years calling for the rel­e­vant laws to be changed while op­pos­ing Cho’s re­lease, calling for a re­trial and urg­ing tougher pun­ish­ment for crimes sim­i­lar to his.</p>
    <p>A De­cem­ber 2017 pe­ti­tion ar­gu­ing against ad­mit­ting Cho back to so­ci­ety drew more than 600,000 sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>As the day of his re­lease ap­proached, peo­ple took to so­cial me­dia to protest, some pray­ing for him to die, while oth­ers cir­cu­lated mes­sages on “how to stab Cho where it hurts if you run into him”.</p>
    <p>Jit­ters are most felt in An­san city, home to 740,000 peo­ple, in­clud­ing Cho’s wife and the vic­tim’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Cho’s wife, who had openly de­fended him say­ing he was a po­lite per­son who did all the house­hold work and never vented his anger, re­port­edly moved house last month due to ex­ces­sive me­dia at­ten­tion and neigh­bour com­plaints.</p>
    <p>But the new apart­ment is just 1km away from the old house.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim’s fam­ily is said to be mov­ing to a dif­fer­ent part of the city. The girl’s fa­ther said in pre­vi­ous me­dia in­ter­views that they could not move away as his daugh­ter, now 20, was used to de­pend­ing on her friends, class­mates and teach­ers.</p>
    <p>He also re­vealed that she has to wear di­a­pers at home as she is no longer able to con­trol her bow­els prop­erly due to or­gan dam­age suf­fered dur­ing the rape.</p>
    <p>He added that the fam­ily can watch only chil­dren’s car­toons at home to­gether as his daugh­ter would col­lapse upon hear­ing any­thing about sex crimes.</p>
    <p>“How can Cho Doo-soon come back to An­san, where his vic­tim lives?” the fa­ther told Cho­sun Ilbo news­pa­per in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“I feel he is try­ing to re­tal­i­ate by mov­ing back.”</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts say Cho should be given a sec­ond chance, now that he has been duly pun­ished.</p>
    <p>Cho, who was un­em­ployed at the time of the 2008 at­tack, ap­par­ently voiced hopes of sell­ing cof­fee on a moun­tain af­ter his re­lease.</p>
    <p>How­ever, crim­i­nal psy­chol­ogy re­searchers at Ky­onggi Univer­sity warned that there is a 76 per cent chance of him com­mit­ting an­other crime, not­ing he has is­sues with al­co­hol and anger man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they will mon­i­tor Cho round the clock, with of­fi­cers skilled in mar­tial arts dis­patched to pa­trol the area around his house.</p>
    <p>At least 15 new closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion cam­eras have been in­stalled in the neigh­bour­hood, and street lamps made brighter.</p>
    <p>Cho will also have to wear an elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing de­vice for seven years, as re­quired by law.</p>
    <p>A Bill was passed ear­lier this month to ban child sex of­fend­ers from go­ing near schools and leav­ing their homes at night and dur­ing hours when stu­dents com­mute to and from school.</p>
    <p>An­san city of­fi­cials are also try­ing to bar Cho from buy­ing al­co­hol, im­pose a cur­few on him and pre­vent him from go­ing near chil­dren’s fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A Twit­ter user wrote: “I’m a stu­dent from An­san... stu­dents like me and my friends are very anx­ious.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know who may be the next vic­tim... We know Cho Doosoon’s face but we won’t be able to tell if it’s him or not, as he will be wear­ing a mask.”</p>
    <p>An­other user added: “Please, I wish he could just stay in jail.”</p>
