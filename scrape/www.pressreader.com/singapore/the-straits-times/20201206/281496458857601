    <p>Sin­ga­pore has in­ten­si­fied prepa­ra­tions to trans­port, store and dis­trib­ute Covid-19 vac­cines, while se­cur­ing a sup­ply of vac­cine doses for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Na­tional car­rier Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) yes­ter­day said it would pri­ori­tise the ship­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines above other cargo once these be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>At a me­dia event, SIA se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of cargo Chin Yau Seng said: “We have been work­ing hard to en­sure that we are ready for one of the big­gest and most im­por­tant sup­ply chain chal­lenges of our gen­er­a­tion – the trans­porta­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines around the world.”</p>
    <p>Ground han­dlers Sats and dnata told The Sun­day Times they are lay­ing the ground­work to in­crease their cool stor­age ca­pa­bil­i­ties to han­dle high vol­umes of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s avi­a­tion reg­u­la­tor and air­port op­er­a­tor have also es­tab­lished a task force of key air cargo in­dus­try mem­bers to tackle the chal­lenges of safely trans­port­ing Covid-19 vac­cines, some of which – like the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine – must be stored at ul­tralow tem­per­a­tures un­til a few days be­fore they are used.</p>
    <p>The moves come with two lead­ing vac­cine can­di­dates now wait­ing for broader reg­u­la­tory ap­proval af­ter suc­cess­ful tri­als.</p>
    <p>Last week, Bri­tain be­came the first Western coun­try to au­tho­rise a vac­cine for gen­eral use against Covid-19, which has killed more than 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide, while Rus­sia is open­ing clin­ics in Moscow to be­gin mass vac­ci­na­tions with its own vac­cine, Sput­nik V.</p>
    <p>SIA said yes­ter­day it will de­ploy its seven Boe­ing 747-400 freighter planes to trans­port vac­cines, and ac­ti­vate pas­sen­ger air­craft to boost ship­ping ca­pac­ity if needed.</p>
    <p>Mr Chin said: “We can roughly take about eight mil­lion doses of a nor­mal vac­cine (on a cargo plane), but for some of the ones that re­quire a lot more dry ice... we will prob­a­bly be able to carry less, maybe four mil­lion or so.”</p>
    <p>SIA will con­duct test flights to trial vac­cine trans­porta­tion soon, sim­i­lar to what air­lines in Bel­gium and the United States are do­ing.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Chin: “We have been in talks with some of the vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers and they are open to the idea. We are work­ing out the de­tails of the tri­als, so you can ex­pect that in time.”</p>
    <p>SIA has also signed agree­ments with cold chain con­tainer providers to en­sure it has suf­fi­cient tem­per­a­ture-con­trolled con­tain­ers to trans­port Covid-19 vac­cines. A cold chain refers to the process in which a tem­per­a­ture-sen­si­tive prod­uct is kept at a de­sired low-tem­per­a­ture range along its en­tire sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>Sats, which helps main­tain the cold chain when it un­loads cargo from planes and hands it over to dis­trib­u­tors, said it is look­ing to add re­frig­er­ated trucks or tem­per­a­ture­con­trolled con­tain­ers on site to boost ca­pac­ity, and has in­creased charg­ing points in an­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>Sats al­ready has an 8,000 sq m fa­cil­ity – slightly larger than a foot­ball field – which han­dles 250,000 tonnes of per­ish­able and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal air freight an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, dnata, which op­er­ates a 1,400 sq m pharma and per­ish­able han­dling cen­tre, may in­stall ad­di­tional on­site cool stor­age con­tain­ers that will dou­ble its ca­pac­ity by early next year.</p>
    <p>Asked whether Sin­ga­pore is up­grad­ing its ca­pa­bil­i­ties to store and trans­port Covid-19 vac­cines do­mes­ti­cally, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said the Repub­lic is equipped with the nec­es­sary in­fra­struc­ture and ca­pa­bil­i­ties to han­dle vac­cines via the cold chain.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said: “MOH has been in dis­cus­sion with the var­i­ous phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies on their Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates and cold chain re­quire­ments. We will con­tinue to reg­u­larly re­view the sit­u­a­tion and make ad­just­ments as needed.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines is tak­ing steps to raise the limit of dry ice it can carry per flight so it can trans­port any Covid-19 vac­cine on a larger scale in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The na­tional car­rier yes­ter­day said it is work­ing with vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers and reg­u­la­tors to in­crease the amount of dry ice that can be car­ried safely on its planes from 3,500kg per cargo flight now.</p>
    <p>Dry ice is key to pre­serv­ing one of the two lead­ing Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates at an ideal tem­per­a­ture while it is trans­ported, but ways must be found to slow down the process by which it sub­li­mates into car­bon diox­ide gas.</p>
    <p>SIA se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of cargo Chin Yau Seng said: “We are work­ing to raise (the limit) even higher. So by the time we need it, I think we will be ready with the higher lim­its.”</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous com­pa­nies along the vac­cine sup­ply chain, in­clud­ing SIA, are build­ing on their ca­pa­bil­i­ties to han­dle an ex­pected in­flux of vac­cine cargo. Sev­eral said they are al­ready well pre­pared to scale up, hav­ing had ca­pa­bil­i­ties in place.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date jointly de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech will have to be stored long term at about mi­nus 70 deg C. But this is not ex­pected to be a ma­jor ob­sta­cle in terms of ship­ping to Sin­ga­pore, as Pfizer will pro­vide a ship­ping con­tainer that can main­tain the re­quired tem­per­a­ture for up to 10 days us­ing dry ice. Once moved to a reg­u­lar fridge, the vac­cine has to be used within five days.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Moderna vac­cine can­di­date has to be kept at mi­nus 20 deg C for long-term stor­age, but can be kept in a reg­u­lar fridge for up to a month. These re­quire­ments are within the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of lo­cal air cargo han­dlers.</p>
    <p>SIA noted that it trans­ported about 22,000 tonnes of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ship­ments, in­clud­ing vac­cines, on its cargo net­work in its last fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>IDEALLY PLACED</p>
    <p>On the car­rier’s abil­ity to trans­port Covid-19 vac­cines at scale when the time comes, Mr Chin said: “SIA has a well-es­tab­lished track record of safely and re­li­ably trans­port­ing crit­i­cal phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ship­ments.”</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port Group (CAG) man­ag­ing direc­tor of air hub de­vel­op­ment Lim Ching Kiat said the Changi air hub has a dozen firms which have at­tained in­ter­na­tional cer­ti­fi­ca­tion in han­dling phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal cargo.</p>
    <p>But to fur­ther pre­pare for Covid-19 vac­cines, CAG has helped to set up an in­dus­try task force in Sin­ga­pore, and also joined a global task force to en­sure re­quire­ments are met.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant vol­umes of any Covid-19 vac­cine – both from SIA and other for­eign air­lines – are ex­pected to pass through Changi Air­port when pro­duc­tion goes into full tilt, given the air­port’s sta­tus as a tran­sit hub.</p>
    <p>Lon­don-based IAG Cargo and Ger­many’s Lufthansa told The Sun­day Times that they are able to in­crease flights to and through Sin­ga­pore when the need to trans­port Covid-19 vac­cines arises.</p>
    <p>Lufthansa vice-pres­i­dent for the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion J. Flo­rian Pfaff said: “Sin­ga­pore is not only ideal be­cause it is ge­o­graph­i­cally well lo­cated but also be­cause of its ex­cel­lent lo­gis­tics in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“It can serve as the perfect hub for de­liv­er­ing time-crit­i­cal and tem­per­a­ture-sen­si­tive com­modi­ties like Covid-19 vac­cines to other South-east Asian coun­tries as well as to Aus­tralia and New Zealand.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Zuel­lig Pharma, a ma­jor phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal dis­trib­u­tor with a pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore, said it is ready and able to take on the dis­tri­bu­tion of any vac­cine lo­cally and in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Other ma­jor dis­trib­u­tors op­er­at­ing in Sin­ga­pore in­clude Glax­oSmithK­line, As­traZeneca and John­son & John­son.</p>
    <p>Zuel­lig’s ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent of dis­tri­bu­tion and client ser­vices Tom Van­molkot said the firm’s stor­age ca­pac­ity at Changi North Way was dou­bled in 2017.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our spe­cial­ist cold chain han­dling team is highly trained to en­sure that all pro­cesses are fol­lowed when pack­ing and de­liv­er­ing prod­ucts in 2 to 8 deg, mi­nus 20 deg and mi­nus 70 deg Cel­sius pack­ag­ing.”</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at Mount El­iz­a­beth</p>
    <p>Novena Hos­pi­tal, said Sin­ga­pore has es­tab­lished a reli­able sup­ply chain to han­dle vac­cines cor­rectly.</p>
    <p>This, on top of Min­istry of Health reg­u­la­tions on vac­cine stor­age, means that vac­ci­na­tion in Sin­ga­pore is safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“The vac­cine, if taken up in suf­fi­cient num­bers, can sig­nif­i­cantly turn the tide for Sin­ga­pore and the world,” said Dr Leong.</p>
    <p>But he said Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to store the two lead­ing Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates at scale for a longer pe­riod may be lim­ited, not­ing that freez­ers that can store items at mi­nus 70 deg C are hard to find and the lo­gis­tics cen­tres that dis­trib­ute vac­cines to clin­ics are gen­er­ally set up to store them at about 2-8 deg C.</p>
    <p>It can serve as the perfect hub for de­liv­er­ing time-crit­i­cal and tem­per­a­ture-sen­si­tive com­modi­ties like Covid-19 vac­cines to other South-east Asian coun­tries as well as to Aus­tralia and ’’</p>
