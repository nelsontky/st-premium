    <p>Rus­sian mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) su­per­star Khabib Nur­magome­dov may have hung up his gloves in Oc­to­ber but for­mer fighter Daniel Cormier, one of his clos­est friends in the sport, be­lieves the Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship (UFC) will find its next big head­liner.</p>
    <p>In an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Cormier, 41, did not skip a beat when asked who the next big prospect from the South Rus­sian re­gion of Dages­tani would be.</p>
    <p>Tip­ping 29-year-old Is­lam Makhachev for the top spot, he said: “I think be­cause he came in (to the UFC in 2015) al­most in the shadow of Khabib, peo­ple for­get how spe­cial he is.</p>
    <p>“Is­lam has all the abil­ity to be the world cham­pion. He’s tal­ented, he’s got fan­tas­tic strik­ing, he’s got fan­tas­tic grap­pling and wrestling.</p>
    <p>“The guy is as well-rounded as well-rounded comes and I do be­lieve that at some point, he will have a UFC cham­pi­onship around his waist and it will be very well de­served.”</p>
    <p>Even as up-and-com­ing fighters jos­tle to take on the man­tle, Nur­magome­dov con­tin­ues to dom­i­nate the spot­light.</p>
    <p>The un­de­feated UFC lightweigh­t cham­pion on Mon­day told Rus­sian news agency matchTV that the or­gan­i­sa­tion has tabled of­fers for him to re­turn to the cage.</p>
    <p>He added that he would dis­cuss this in a meet­ing with UFC pres­i­dent Dana White in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>While Nur­magome­dov, 32, was un­en­thu­si­as­tic at chang­ing his mind on his re­tire­ment, this was not the case with White and Nur­magome­dov’s man­ager Ali Ab­de­laziz, who were quoted by MMA me­dia as be­ing op­ti­mistic of the chances of a come­back.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, Cormier – who de­clined to spec­u­late whether Nur­magome­dov would re­turn to the oc­tagon – be­lieves it will not ruin the Rus­sian’s per­fect MMA record, which stands at 29 wins.</p>
    <p>Asked to pre­dict what the new year holds for Nur­magome­dov, Cormier would only say: “How about this – by the end of 2021, Khabib will still be un­de­feated.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what the num­ber on the left side (wins col­umn) is go­ing to be, but he’ll still be un­de­feated.”</p>
    <p>The two fighters’ friend­ship blos­somed partly due to Nur­magome­dov train­ing of­ten at the AKA Gym in Cal­i­for­nia, where Cormier pre­vi­ously trained. The Amer­i­can is now a trainer and also works as an an­a­lyst and com­men­ta­tor for the UFC af­ter re­tir­ing in August.</p>
    <p>The for­mer UFC light heavy­weight and heavy­weight cham­pion has tipped the heavy­weight divi­sion to be an ex­cit­ing one this year, with cham­pion Stipe Mio­cic fac­ing cred­i­ble threats from the likes of Fran­cis Ngan­nou and light heavy­weight great Jon Jones, who is mov­ing up a weight class.</p>
    <p>Cormier is less cer­tain, how­ever, about what lies ahead for another MMA star, Conor McGre­gor.</p>
    <p>The Ir­ish­man is sched­uled for a bout against Dustin Poirier at the UFC 257 event on Jan 23, with crit­ics say­ing he is no longer hun­gry for suc­cess in the UFC af­ter be­com­ing its top star in 2016. He then went on to a highly lu­cra­tive ex­hi­bi­tion box­ing bout with Floyd May­weather Jr the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>While Cormier said McGre­gor’s sta­tus as one of the big­gest stars of the sport “will al­ways stand the test of time”, he added: “I don’t know how much he’s go­ing to fight (in 2021) be­cause he wanted to fight three times last year, and he never did, he didn’t get to do it.</p>
    <p>“Which is why I think the sit­u­a­tion with Conor right now is that you just have to ap­pre­ci­ate it when he com­petes.”</p>
