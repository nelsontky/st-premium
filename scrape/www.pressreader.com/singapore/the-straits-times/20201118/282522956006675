    <p>When all else fails, look to some­thing new: a new hobby, goal or ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a par­tic­u­larly hard patch of a com­pe­ti­tion, some ath­letes say they fo­cus on a dif­fer­ent sense, one that per­haps is not at the fore­front of their mind when the pain sets in.</p>
    <p>A run­ner could note the smells around her and a climber could note the way his hair is blow­ing in the wind.</p>
    <p>When ath­letes are in­jured, sports psy­chol­o­gists and coaches of­ten en­cour­age them to find a new ac­tiv­ity to en­gage their mind and body.</p>
    <p>The key is to adapt, adapt and then adapt again.</p>
    <p>“We all want men­tal tough­ness – it’s an im­por­tant part of deal­ing with dif­fi­cult things,” says Dr Michael</p>
    <p>Ger­vais, a psy­chol­o­gist who spe­cialises in high per­for­mance and hosts the Find­ing Mas­tery pod­cast.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent def­i­ni­tion of men­tal tough­ness is the abil­ity to pivot and to be nim­ble and flexible.”</p>
    <p>Caf­fari has shifted to spend­ing a lot of time in her gar­den, some­thing she did not have as much time for when she was trav­el­ling for much of the year.</p>
    <p>“The neigh­bours are quite happy with that,” she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>Anker has put his ex­tra en­ergy into cal­lig­ra­phy. “Yes­ter­day, I tran­scribed quotes from</p>
    <p>John Lewis and I find that sat­is­fy­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>When his favourite trails were closed be­cause of lock­downs, Wolter­ing de­cided to run ev­ery street of his home town in Ot­tawa, Illi­nois. It was about 320km.</p>
    <p>“The next mo­ment is al­ways com­pletely un­cer­tain and it’s al­ways been that way,” says Dr Ger­vais.</p>
    <p>But adapt­ing, ad­just­ing ex­pec­ta­tions and dis­cov­er­ing new goals or hob­bies can al­low you to con­tinue to build the mus­cle that is men­tal tough­ness.</p>
    <p>The bot­tom line? “Op­ti­mism is an an­ti­dote to anx­i­ety,” says Dr Ger­vais.</p>
