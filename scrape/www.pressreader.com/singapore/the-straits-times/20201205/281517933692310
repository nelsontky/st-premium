    <p>What the story is</p>
    <p>In a world first, Sin­ga­pore on Wed­nes­day ap­proved the sale of a cul­tured meat prod­uct here.</p>
    <p>The chicken bites by Cal­i­for­nian start-up Eat Just are made by cul­tur­ing an­i­mal cells in biore­ac­tors in­stead of rear­ing an­i­mals on farms, and are not yet avail­able for sale and con­sump­tion any­where else.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) said it is al­low­ing the cul­tured chicken to be sold af­ter its eval­u­a­tions de­ter­mine it to be safe.</p>
    <p>The com­pany would not be drawn on a time­line on when the prod­uct will be avail­able, but the firm’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Josh Tet­rick told The Straits Times on Thurs­day that it will be soon, and at a</p>
    <p>“higher-end” restau­rant.</p>
    <p>The aim is to make cul­tured meat cheaper than con­ven­tion­ally farmed meat, he added.</p>
    <p>Why it mat­ters</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tive pro­teins, such as cul­tured meat, could pave the way for more sus­tain­able food pro­duc­tion and bet­ter food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>While a re­port on land use by the United Na­tions’ cli­mate sci­ence body last year found that plant­based diets were still associated with a lower en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact, it may not be fea­si­ble to get ev­ery­one to go vege­tar­ian.</p>
    <p>Cul­tur­ing meat could be an al­ter­na­tive to rear­ing live­stock, which makes up 14.5 per cent of emis­sions from hu­man ac­tiv­ity, ac­cord­ing to the UN’s Food and Agri­cul­ture Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Cul­tur­ing meat in­volves tak­ing cells from an an­i­mal (of­ten done in a harm­less way), and then grow­ing the cells in a nu­tri­ent broth within a biore­ac­tor. This process has been associated with a num­ber of en­vi­ron­men­tal ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>One, it re­duces emis­sions associated with rear­ing live­stock.</p>
    <p>There is less need to clear forests for farms or grow crops for an­i­mal feed, and the process also re­duces meth­ane emis­sions from ru­mi­nants like cows, which re­lease a lot of meth­ane when they digest food.</p>
    <p>Meth­ane is con­sid­ered a more po­tent green­house gas than car­bon diox­ide over shorter time spans.</p>
    <p>Two, cul­tur­ing meat can be done in a smaller land area com­pared with the live­stock sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>Three, it al­lows meat to be pro­duced without slaugh­ter. This avoids the need to con­fine live­stock to small spa­ces, and re­duces the chance of dis­eases spread­ing be­tween hu­mans and an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Cul­tured meat could also boost the re­silience of im­port-de­pen­dent na­tions like Sin­ga­pore, which sources more than 90 per cent of its food from over­seas.</p>
    <p>Eat Just has said its cul­tured chicken bites will be man­u­fac­tured in Sin­ga­pore, and Mr Tet­rick told The Straits Times on Thurs­day that the firm aims to pro­duce enough not just for the do­mes­tic mar­ket, but also for the rest of Asia.</p>
    <p>What lies ahead</p>
    <p>The need to feed a grow­ing global pop­u­la­tion is strain­ing food pro­duc­tion sys­tems.</p>
    <p>And the im­pacts of cli­mate change – be they chang­ing rain­fall pat­terns or more fre­quent ex­treme weather events – could put fur­ther stress on food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>These high­light the need for new ways of pro­duc­ing food that come with a smaller car­bon foot­print.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have said the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of cul­tur­ing meat – an en­ergy-in­ten­sive process – is not defini­tively bet­ter than rear­ing an­i­mals the tra­di­tional way.</p>
    <p>Con­text is im­por­tant. In Sin­ga­pore, for in­stance, most en­ergy is gen­er­ated by nat­u­ral gas – a cleaner fos­sil fuel than coal or oil. Ad­vance­ments made in re­new­able en­ergy sys­tems, and the scal­ing up of cul­tured meat pro­duc­tion, could boost ef­fi­ciency and lower the car­bon foot­print of cul­tured meat.</p>
    <p>As with many new in­no­va­tions, more stud­ies are needed to as­sess the dif­fer­ent im­pacts of cul­tured meat prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The SFA has done so on the food safety front. But even as re­search on en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact con­tin­ues, an­other hur­dle re­mains: Con­sumers’ re­cep­tive­ness to eat­ing meat made a dif­fer­ent way.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of cli­mate change can al­ready be felt. Con­sumers can help – by keep­ing an open mind.</p>
