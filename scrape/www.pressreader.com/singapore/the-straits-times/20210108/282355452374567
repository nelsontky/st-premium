    <p>Pre­vi­ously, a video an­a­lyst would sit and pause the match at ev­ery in­stance he wanted record­ing, that could take four or five hours... With Met­rica Sports... that same work is done in two or three min­utes.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Cris­tiano Ron­aldo and his Por­tu­gal team­mates may be sur­prised to learn the video and data analysis their coaches use was de­vised by sci­en­tists who used it to track the be­hav­iour of mice, mon­keys and hu­man eye move­ments.</p>
    <p>Ruben Saave­dra, the Span­ish CEO of Met­rica Sports, says it is not a stretch to trans­fer the use of data to track the be­hav­iour of mice and rats to the task of track­ing “move­ment of play­ers on the pitch”. Saave­dra and Ar­gen­tinian co-founder Bruno Dagnino – who stud­ied the eye move­ments of mon­keys and hu­mans – found they shared more than an in­ter­est in sci­ence when they were study­ing for their PhDs in the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>“We had two things in com­mon: as Barcelona and Ar­gentina fans, Lionel Messi was an easy link, and we were the only peo­ple on our courses who loved foot­ball,” Saave­dra said. “There are lots of nerds in sci­ence who do not have other hob­bies and so he and I could talk foot­ball, which was nice.”</p>
    <p>The fi­nal part of the puz­zle was com­plete with another Ar­gen­tinian, Enzo Angilletta, who had a video pro­duc­tion com­pany.</p>
    <p>To­gether they de­vel­oped a sys­tem that in­te­grates data with video analysis, which had been done only man­u­ally be­fore. By mar­ry­ing data and video they cre­ated what its de­vel­op­ers call a “work­flow of foot­ball an­a­lysts”.</p>
    <p>“Pre­sent­ing graphs and raw data was not enough for clubs,” said Saave­dra.</p>
    <p>The process is un­usual in that it analy­ses tech­ni­cal skills and po­si­tion­ing dur­ing matches, rather than sim­ply mea­sure dis­tance cov­ered. Thus, the na­tional teams of Por­tu­gal and Paraguay, and clubs as far afield as Mel­bourne Vic­tory and San­tos in Brazil have ben­e­fited from the video and data analysis prod­uct, with the top clubs pay­ing more €100,000 (S$162,300) a year. Thanks to that in­come, Met­rica have been able to pro­duce Play Ba­sic, a ver­sion of the analysis tool which is avail­able to down­load for free. It has at­tracted a di­verse clien­tele from acad­e­mies in Africa to am­a­teur play­ers and coaches from rugby union, cricket and ice hockey.</p>
    <p>“A few years ago we had to have cam­eras in sta­dia but it has evolved,” he said. “Now we can track any game on any video with our new tech­nol­ogy. We are work­ing to au­to­mate the man­ual work in ac­quir­ing the data so it will be af­ford­able for some clubs.”</p>
    <p>Saave­dra sees Met­rica Sports as a “mini-Tesla”, the elec­tric car com­pany, be­gin­ning with a high­end ex­pen­sive prod­uct which can then by used to chan­nel funds into the de­vel­op­ment and launch of a more af­ford­able one.</p>
    <p>“The first clients fund in­vest­ment and de­vel­op­ment of tech­nol­ogy which ben­e­fits them and at same time al­lows us to de­velop new tech­nolo­gies to cut costs,” he said. “Mak­ing this tech­nol­ogy ac­ces­si­ble to teams like Stock­port County or acad­e­mies in Viet­nam was pos­si­ble be­cause we part­nered with the elite clubs first.”</p>
    <p>While the price may stay at six fig­ures for elite clubs and na­tional sides, the amount of time saved on the weary eyes of their re­spec­tive video an­a­lysts is im­mea­sur­able.</p>
    <p>“This saves them tonnes of time,” said Saave­dra. “Pre­vi­ously, a video an­a­lyst would sit and pause the match at ev­ery in­stance he wanted record­ing, that could take four or five hours to watch the whole game. With Met­rica Sports, they sim­ply click a few but­tons and that same work is done in two or three min­utes.”</p>
    <p>Saave­dra uses an ex­am­ple of a coach telling two de­fend­ers never to be fur­ther than a spe­cific dis­tance from play.</p>
    <p>“We can write an al­go­rithm that shows ev­ery mo­ment when they are fur­ther away than they should be as di­rected by the coach.”</p>
