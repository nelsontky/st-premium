    <p>LON­DON • Nearly two bil­lion doses of Covid-19 vac­cines will be shipped and flown to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries next year in a mam­moth op­er­a­tion, the United Na­tions chil­dren’s agency Unicef said yes­ter­day, as world lead­ers vowed to en­sure the fair dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Unicef said it was work­ing with over 350 air­lines and freight com­pa­nies to de­liver vac­cines and one bil­lion sy­ringes to poor coun­tries such as Bu­rundi, Afghanista­n and Ye­men as part of Covax, a global Covid-19 vac­cine al­lo­ca­tion plan with the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>“This in­valu­able col­lab­o­ra­tion will go a long way to en­sure that enough trans­port ca­pac­ity is in place for this his­toric and mam­moth op­er­a­tion,” Ms Etl­eva Kadilli, di­rec­tor of Unicef’s Sup­ply Di­vi­sion, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Covax – co-led by the Gavi vac­cine group, the WHO and the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions – aims to dis­cour­age gov­ern­ments from hoard­ing Covid-19 vac­cines and to fo­cus on first vac­ci­nat­ing the most at risk in ev­ery coun­try.</p>
    <p>At a Group of 20 sum­mit last week­end, lead­ers of the world’s 20 big­gest economies pledged to en­sure the eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines, drugs and tests so that poorer coun­tries are not left out.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the pan­demic hit, ac­cess to vac­cines was un­equal, with around 20 mil­lion ba­bies not re­ceiv­ing vac­cines that could save them from se­ri­ous dis­eases, death, dis­abil­ity and ill health, ac­cord­ing to the WHO.</p>
    <p>“We need all hands on deck as we get ready to de­liver Covid-19 vac­cine doses, sy­ringes and more per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment to pro­tect front-line work­ers around the globe,” said Unicef’s Ms Kadilli, who is work­ing with the Pan Amer­i­can Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Unicef’s role with Covax stems from its sta­tus as the sin­gle-largest vac­cine buyer in the world. It said it pro­cures more than two bil­lion vac­cine doses an­nu­ally for rou­tine im­mu­ni­sa­tion and out­break re­sponse on be­half of nearly 100 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Drug­mak­ers and re­search cen­tres world­wide are rac­ing to de­velop Covid-19 vac­cines, with large global tri­als of sev­eral of the can­di­dates – in­volv­ing tens of thou­sands of par­tic­i­pants – well un­der way.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and BioNTech could se­cure emer­gency US and Euro­pean au­tho­ri­sa­tion for their Covid-19 vac­cine next month af­ter fi­nal trial re­sults showed a 95 per cent suc­cess rate and no se­ri­ous side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Moderna last week re­leased pre­lim­i­nary data for its vac­cine show­ing 94.5 per cent ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>The bet­ter-than-ex­pected re­sults from the two vac­cines, both de­vel­oped with new mes­sen­ger RNA tech­nol­ogy, have raised hopes for an end to a pan­demic that has killed more than 1.3 mil­lion people and wreaked havoc on economies and daily life.</p>
