    <p>BRASILIA • The death of a black man beaten by white se­cu­rity guards at a su­per­mar­ket sparked protests across Brazil as the coun­try cel­e­brated Black Con­scious­ness Day.</p>
    <p>A video of Thurs­day night’s in­ci­dent in the south­ern city of Porto Ale­gre cap­tured on a wit­ness’ mo­bile phone was broad­cast on so­cial net­works and Brazil­ian me­dia.</p>
    <p>As the clip went vi­ral, around 1,000 pro­test­ers i n Sao Paulo marched on Fri­day to a branch of the French-owned Car­refour su­per­mar­ket chain and stoned the glass store­front be­fore storm­ing the premises, trash­ing and burn­ing goods.</p>
    <p>“Car­refour’s hands are dirty with black blood,” read one ban­ner held up by demon­stra­tors.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in Porto Ale­gre used tear gas and flash bang grenades to dis­perse pro­test­ers in front of the su­per­mar­ket where the death took place, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Protests also broke out in the cap­i­tal Brasilia, Belo Hor­i­zonte and Rio de Janeiro, where a crowd pick­eted a Car­refour su­per­mar­ket to pre­vent cus­tomers from reach­ing the check­out points.</p>
    <p>The video that went vi­ral on so­cial me­dia shows 40-year-old welder Joao Al­berto Sil­veira Fre­itas re­peat­edly be­ing punched in the face and head by a se­cu­rity guard while he is re­strained by an­other at the su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>A woman stands be­side them, film­ing with her mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary po­lice in Rio Grande do Sul state said the man had threat­ened a fe­male worker at the su­per­mar­ket, who called se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Mr Sil­veira Fre­itas lost con­scious­ness dur­ing the as­sault and died on the spot as medics tried to re­vive him.</p>
    <p>A friend of the vic­tim who wit­nessed the beat­ing told G1 news that as the se­cu­rity guards were hit­ting him, Mr Sil­veira Fre­itas “screamed that he could not breathe”, a scene rem­i­nis­cent of the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd in the United States. Mr Floyd, a black man, suf­fo­cated be­neath the knee of a white po­lice of­fi­cer in Min­neapo­lis in May.</p>
    <p>Both the su­per­mar­ket se­cu­rity guards were ar­rested. One of them was iden­ti­fied as a mem­ber of the mil­i­tary po­lice who worked part-time at the su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Car­refour’s Brazil­ian sub­sidiary de­plored the “bru­tal death” of Mr Sil­veira Fre­itas and promised to take “ap­pro­pri­ate mea­sures to hold ac­count­able those in­volved in this crim­i­nal case”.</p>
    <p>Car­refour said it would cut ties with the se­cu­rity com­pany that em­ployed the guards.</p>
