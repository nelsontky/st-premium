    <p>NUR­BUR­GRING • Valt­teri Bot­tas is look­ing to pick up where he left off af­ter he seized pole po­si­tion for the Eifel Grand Prix yes­ter­day, with Mercedes team­mate Lewis Hamil­ton along­side on the front row of the grid at the Nur­bur­gring.</p>
    <p>Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen, who had been on pro­vi­sional pole af­ter the first fly­ing laps of the fi­nal ses­sion at the Ger­man cir­cuit, qual­i­fied in third place, with Fer­rari’s Charles Le­clerc fourth.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas’ pole was his third of 2020 and an 11th in 11 races this sea­son for Mercedes but this one looked in the bal­ance right to the end.</p>
    <p>“It’s such a nice feel­ing when you get it on the last lap, with the last chance,” said the Finn af­ter cel­e­brat­ing his 14th ca­reer pole. He was fastest by just 0.256 of a sec­ond.</p>
    <p>“The last lap in Q3 (the fi­nal phase) was spot on. Of course I be­lieve I can win. That’s the only goal for to­mor­row and hope­fully we can have a good start.”</p>
    <p>Bot­tas, who won the Rus­sian Grand Prix the last time out, is 44 points be­hind six-time world cham­pion Hamil­ton (205), who will still fancy his chances of equalling Michael Schu­macher’s record of 91 ca­reer wins at a track that last hosted an F1 race in 2013.</p>
    <p>“Valt­teri is two tenths ahead so he did a great job, so con­grats to him,” said the Briton. “There’s a lot to play for to­mor­row, so I need to get my head down.</p>
    <p>“It’s an amazing cir­cuit, one of the his­toric cir­cuits we have, so def­i­nitely great to be back here.”</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen was con­tent with third place, say­ing: “We are get­ting closer to Mercedes which I think is very pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“A lit­tle bit dis­ap­point­ing, I was ex­pect­ing a lit­tle bit more. It’s just in Q3, it started un­der­steer­ing a bit too much and, when it’s so cold, you’re grain­ing the front tyres and ba­si­cally eat­ing up the rubber when that hap­pens. That cost me a bit of lap time.”</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s Nico Hulken­berg will make an un­ex­pected ap­pear­ance to­day from last place on the grid, af­ter re­plac­ing an un­well Lance Stroll at Rac­ing Point.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, For­mula One’s gov­ern­ing body on Fri­day ap­proved a ban on the sort of “re­verse engi­neer­ing” that al­lowed the Rac­ing Point team to com­pete this sea­son with a car re­sem­bling last year’s ti­tle-win­ning Mercedes.</p>
    <p>The FIA said its World Mo­tor Sport Coun­cil had ap­proved changes to the 2021 tech­ni­cal reg­u­la­tions “that will pre­vent the ex­ten­sive use of re­verse engi­neer­ing of ri­val de­signs for the de­sign of a car’s aero­dy­namic sur­faces”.</p>
    <p>Rac­ing Point’s ‘Pink Mercedes’ de­sign led to a protest by ri­vals Re­nault, with the team fined €400,000 (S$640,000) by ste­wards and docked 15 points for copy­ing Mercedes’ 2019 brake ducts.</p>
    <p>The team were al­lowed to con­tinue com­pet­ing with­out hav­ing to re­design the of­fend­ing parts.</p>
    <p>HARD WORK AHEAD</p>
    <p>There’s a lot to play for to­mor­row, so I need to get my head down.</p>
