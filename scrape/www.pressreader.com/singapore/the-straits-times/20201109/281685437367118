    <p>Myan­mar started vote count­ing yes­ter­day in the coun­try’s sec­ond election since mil­i­tary rule ended in 2011.</p>
    <p>De­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, mil­lions voted, with long lines out­side polling booths, which opened at 6am lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD) party is widely ex­pected to tri­umph again. The polls are seen more as a barom­e­ter of pub­lic sat­is­fac­tion with its first­term per­for­mance un­der leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has an un­easy power-shar­ing ar­range­ment with the coun­try’s mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion broad­casts showed early bal­lots be­ing counted in the pres­ence of can­di­dates, election of­fi­cers and ob­servers.</p>
    <p>In Yangon, of­fi­cials en­sured so­cial dis­tanc­ing at vot­ing booths and tem­per­a­ture checks were done. Masks and face shields were handed out to those en­ter­ing the vot­ing area.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, Myan­mar has logged 61,377 cases of Covid-19 and 1,420 deaths.</p>
    <p>Just over 37 mil­lion peo­ple were el­i­gi­ble to vote and more than 5,000 can­di­dates from dozens of po­lit­i­cal par­ties vied for 1,117 seats at the cen­tral Par­lia­ment and re­gional as­sem­blies, ac­cord­ing to the Union Election Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Cast­ing his vote in the cap­i­tal Naypy­itaw yes­ter­day, Myan­mar’s pow­er­ful mil­i­tary chief Min Aung Hlaing told re­porters: “I will ac­cept peo­ple’s wishes after election re­sults come out.”</p>
    <p>It was a climb­down from the hawk­ish stance he adopted last week, pub­licly re­buk­ing the election com­mis­sion and govern­ment and re­fus­ing to com­mit to ac­cept­ing the re­sult.</p>
    <p>“We can­not deny it,” the se­nior gen­eral said yes­ter­day, ap­pear­ing to re­lent. “We must ac­cept it. We need to think how we can ad­dress peo­ple’s griev­ances.”</p>
    <p>De­spite ced­ing its di­rect rule to a par­lia­men­tary sys­tem in 2011, the</p>
    <p>Tat­madaw, as Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary is called, con­tin­ues to wield sig­nif­i­cant in­flu­ence via its quota of 25 per cent of all par­lia­men­tary seats and con­trol of the De­fence, Bor­der Af­fairs and Home min­istries.</p>
    <p>Its proxy party, the Union Sol­i­dar­ity and Devel­op­ment Party, is also the big­gest chal­lenger to the NLD in govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Suu Kyi, who sidesteppe­d mil­i­tary-crafted re­stric­tions by adopt­ing the ti­tle of state coun­sel­lor shortly after her 2015 tri­umph, told vot­ers last Thurs­day that democ­racy re­mained Myan­mar’s best bet de­spite its flaws: “Ev­ery vote is im­por­tant be­cause it cre­ates your own des­tiny.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer po­lit­i­cal pris­oner rode a wave of op­ti­mism in 2015 to reap a land­slide vic­tory, but has since strug­gled to main­tain mo­men­tum amid dis­ap­point­ment from eth­nic mi­nori­ties and in­ter­na­tional crit­i­cism for her de­fence of the Tat­madaw against al­le­ga­tions of geno­cide.</p>
    <p>Mr Kan Myint Tun, 38, was among those vot­ing yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“This election is 100 per cent im­por­tant, so peo­ple risked their lives to come and vote,” the Yan­gonbased com­pany man­ager told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“I am not sat­is­fied with the NLD’s per­for­mance over these past five years, as some of their mem­bers of Par­lia­ment and min­is­ters are not qual­i­fied. But I want to give them an­other chance, so that they can fin­ish their projects,” he said.</p>
    <p>It is still not clear if over­all turnout will sur­pass the 2015 record of 69 per cent.</p>
    <p>But Ms Mya Nan­dar Thin, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of New Myan­mar Foun­da­tion, told The Straits Times: “De­spite Covid-19, vot­ers dared to come out and ex­er­cise their rights. That is im­pres­sive.”</p>
