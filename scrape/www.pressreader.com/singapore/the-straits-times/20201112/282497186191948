    <p>Carparks, nar­row cor­ri­dors and a wet mar­ket i n Gey­lang Serai serve as back­drops to a se­ries of con­tem­po­rary dance films by lo­cal dance com­pany P7:1SMA.</p>
    <p>The films, which draw on the sights, sounds and sto­ries of the neigh­bour­hood, are part of the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s Arts In Your Neigh­bour­hood pro­gramme, which be­gins to­day and is of­fer­ing dig­i­tal as well as on-site pro­grammes for the first time.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t want it to be a ‘trib­ute’ to Gey­lang or things that rep­re­sented the spec­ta­cle of Gey­lang,” says the dance com­pany’s artis­tic di­rec­tor Norhaizad Adam (above). “We were in­ter­ested in ev­ery­day things, ev­ery­day sit­u­a­tions, ev­ery­day peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>District 14: 7 Kali Bah, as the rit­u­al­is­tic film se­ries is ti­tled, is set to the theme of mi­gra­tion and change. The chore­og­ra­phy was in­spired by let­ters, au­dio record­ings, pho­to­graphs, tex­tiles and ob­jects cre­ated and gath­ered by young peo­ple, se­niors and lo­cal mer­chants in en­gage­ment ses­sions with P7:1SMA.</p>
    <p>A group of se­niors wrote let­ters in­spired by the neigh­bour­hood, which youth in turn re­sponded to in the form of photos, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Gey­lang Serai has a his­tory of flood­ing, Norhaizad, 33, says: “We adapted this nat­u­ral dis­as­ter into a metaphor­i­cal con­flu­ence of mem­o­ries – the re­mem­ber­ing, the for­get­ting, the re­birthing. (We are) ask­ing ques­tions about place iden­tity, mem­ory ob­jects and what hope means to­day.”</p>
    <p>Seven short films, each around seven min­utes, will be launched on­line from Mon­day to Nov 22.</p>
    <p>A 20-minute “epi­logue” will be streamed on­line on Nov 29, the last day of Arts In Your Neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>The Arts In Your Neigh­bour­hood pro­gramme, which has its main sea­sons i n March and Novem­ber, re­turns this month with a fo­cus on the towns of Kal­lang and Gey­lang.</p>
    <p>One of the 11 events is a vir­tual choose-your-own-ad­ven­ture story by dig­i­tal pub­lisher Tusi­tala and author Ak­shita Nanda, which invites peo­ple to “walk” around Kal­lang River from their own homes.</p>
    <p>An­other high­light is Bril­liant Corners: The City Is Bloom­ing, a project by cre­ative stu­dio Sys­tem Sov­er­eign, which fea­tures five murals in Ka­tong and Gey­lang by artists Ink & Clog, Jaba, Oak & Bindi and Kiat.</p>
    <p>The murals, which are lo­cated in Joo Chiat Com­plex, the Gey­lang Park Con­nec­tor un­der­pass and on the side of shop­houses, re­spond to sto­ries from residents as well as young peo­ple at St Pa­trick’s School and the Jamiyah Chil­dren’s Home.</p>
    <p>The murals are marked out on the Bril­liant Corners Art Trail App.</p>
    <p>The public can also tune into a playlist of songs the artists had lis­tened to while painting the murals.</p>
    <p>Sys­tem Sov­er­eign’s co-founder Jonathan Nah Eng Kiat, 46, one of the artists, was touched by the “en­thu­si­as­tic” re­sponse from the public, adding that some of the neigh­bour­ing shop own­ers also of­fered their walls for painting.</p>
    <p>Pedes­tri­ans stopped to chat with the artists too.</p>
    <p>“The sim­ple act of painting a wall was able to ig­nite con­ver­sa­tions be­tween strangers... It was su­per pos­i­tive and re­ally sweet.”</p>
    <p>Ms Elaine Ng, NAC’s se­nior di­rec­tor of en­gage­ment and par­tic­i­pa­tion, says: “Many artists, part­ners and cul­tural or­gan­i­sa­tions have risen to the oc­ca­sion by lever­ag­ing tech­nol­ogy to present the sto­ries of Kal­lang and Gey­lang in en­gag­ing ways on­line, while re­tain­ing some phys­i­cal pro­grammes for Sin­ga­pore­ans to ap­pre­ci­ate the arts from wher­ever they are.</p>
    <p>“This is no mean feat and we ap­plaud the re­silience and in­ge­nu­ity of the arts com­mu­nity in work­ing with NAC to keep in line with the safe man­age­ment mea­sures as they con­tinue to co-cre­ate with the di­verse com­mu­ni­ties of residents.”</p>
