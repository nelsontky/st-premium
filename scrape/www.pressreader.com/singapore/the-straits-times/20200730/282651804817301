    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Lead­ing United States movie theatre chain AMC and Uni­ver­sal Pic­tures an­nounced a deal on Tues­day, mark­ing a wa­ter­shed for Hol­ly­wood that will al­low home au­di­ences to watch ma­jor films much sooner than usual.</p>
    <p>Un­der the agree­ment, Uni­ver­sal’s new movies will be avail­able to video-on-de­mand plat­forms af­ter show­ing for three week­ends, or 17 days, in the­atres. That marks a big change for the i ndus­try, where ma­jor films were not re­leased for home view­ing be­fore an av­er­age of three months in the­atres.</p>
    <p>“The the­atri­cal ex­pe­ri­ence con­tin­ues to be the cor­ner­stone of our busi­ness. The part­ner­ship we’ve forged with AMC is driven by our col­lec­tive de­sire to en­sure a thriv­ing fu­ture for the film dis­tri­bu­tion ecosys­tem and to meet con­sumer de­mand with flex­i­bil­ity and op­tion­al­ity,” said Ms Donna Lan­g­ley, chair of Uni­ver­sal Filmed En­ter­tain­ment Group, in com­ment­ing on the deal.</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­sal dis­trib­utes the Fast & Fu­ri­ous and De­spi­ca­ble Me fran­chises, among other films.</p>
    <p>AMC, the largest theatre chain with 8,000 screens across North Amer­ica, will share in the rev­enue from the on-de­mand busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“AMC en­thu­si­as­ti­cally em­braces this new in­dus­try model,” said AMC chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Adam Aron, adding it could help stu­dio prof­its and lead to more new films.</p>
    <p>“This multi-year agree­ment pre­serves ex­clu­siv­ity for the­atri­cal view­ing for at least the first three week­ends of a film’s re­lease, dur­ing which time a con­sid­er­able ma­jor­ity of a movie’s the­atri­cal box of­fice rev­enue typ­i­cally is gen­er­ated,” he added.</p>
    <p>The full terms of the deal, which also ap­plies to re­leases from Uni­ver­sal’s Fo­cus Fea­tures, were not dis­closed. Uni­ver­sal and AMC are dis­cussing dis­tri­bu­tion plans for Europe and the Mid­dle East, the com­pa­nies said.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment comes as the movie in­dus­try is fac­ing a sort of reck­on­ing as the coron­avirus pan­demic has shut down movie the­aters across the US and brought movie pro­duc­tions to a screech­ing halt. AMC The­atres is aim­ing to re­open its cin­e­mas in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Stu­dios have been push­ing to make their movies avail­able in liv­ing rooms sooner than the typ­i­cal time­line of roughly 90 days af­ter they de­but in cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>The deal comes as a sur­prise as AMC and Uni­ver­sal Pic­tures have been at log­ger­heads af­ter the lat­ter forged ahead with early dig­i­tal re­leases.</p>
    <p>AMC in April an­nounced that it will no longer play any Uni­ver­sal Pic­tures movies on its screens af­ter the stu­dio re­leased the chil­dren’s film se­quel Trolls World Tour di­rectly to on-de­mand plat­forms be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
