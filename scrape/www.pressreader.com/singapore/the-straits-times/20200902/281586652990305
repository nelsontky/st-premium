    <p>Marathoner Ash­ley Liew, 33, told the State Courts yes­ter­day that former team­mate Soh Rui Yong’s al­le­ga­tions about his act of sports­man­ship came from “out of the blue” and were “un­pro­voked”. Liew took the stand on the first day of his law­suit against Soh and is ac­cus­ing the lat­ter of de­fam­ing him on five in­stances.</p>
    <p>Former team­mate Soh Rui Yong’s al­le­ga­tions on so­cial me­dia about his act of sports­man­ship came “out of the blue” and were “un­pro­voked”, said marathoner Ash­ley Liew in the State Court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Liew, 33, took to the stand for 21/ hours on the first day of his</p>
    <p>2 defama­tion suit against Soh, who is rep­re­sented by Clarence Lun from Fox­wood LLC.</p>
    <p>The former is ac­cus­ing 29-yearold Soh of de­fam­ing him in five in­stances via com­ments made on so­cial me­dia and is seek­ing $120,000 in dam­ages.</p>
    <p>“I was very shocked my­self when I heard the al­le­ga­tions... it was out of the blue and un­pro­voked af­ter rac­ing in 2015 and this was raised in 2018,” said Liew, who is rep­re­sented by Mark Teng from That.Le­gal LLC.</p>
    <p>The dis­pute be­tween both run­ners be­gan in Oc­to­ber 2018, when two-time SEA Games marathon cham­pion Soh in a Face­book post dis­puted Liew’s ac­count of an act of sports­man­ship that oc­curred dur­ing the 2015 SEA Games marathon fi­nal. Liew said he had slowed down to al­low other run­ners to catch up af­ter they missed a U-turn and took the wrong path.</p>
    <p>Liew, a doc­tor of chi­ro­prac­tic, re­ceived a spe­cial award for sports­man­ship at the Sin­ga­pore Sports Awards in June 2016, and was sub­se­quently nom­i­nated for and won the Pierre de Cou­bertin World Fair Play Tro­phy in Sep­tem­ber that year.</p>
    <p>Soh’s lawyer said yes­ter­day that there was no rea­son for his client to speak up un­less there was “some­thing fun­da­men­tally un­true that pricked his con­science”. He added: “We will seek to prove the act of Fair Play did not oc­cur, and what the plain­tiff says (are) lies.”</p>
    <p>In his cross ex­am­i­na­tion of Liew, Lun pressed him on sev­eral points in his tes­ti­mony, rais­ing his voice on sev­eral oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Re­cap­ping the U-turn in­ci­dent at the 2015 SEA Games marathon, Liew said he re­called Cam­bo­dia’s Ku­ni­aki Tak­izaki had been the first to close the gap and over­take him af­ter get­ting back on the right route. There were 10 other run­ners try­ing to catch up, and he added: “I was still go­ing at a slower marathon pace... at the 700m point, the or­der some­what re­sumed with Tak­izaki in front and the rest of us were in a tight pack.” He re­it­er­ated that he was in the mid­dle of the pack be­fore mak­ing the U-turn and re­mained so af­ter the oth­ers had caught up.</p>
    <p>But Lun re­torted: “I put it to you that you’re ly­ing when you said that you were in the mid­dle of the pack.”</p>
    <p>Liew re­sponded: “No, I dis­agree.” Lun also re­ferred to a June 12, 2015 episode of Me­di­a­corp’s The 5 Show where Liew was in­ter­viewed, and the pro­gramme’s host had said Liew “slowed down to a crawl” and this “cost him the gold medal”.</p>
    <p>When pressed by Lun if he thought he had a chance at the gold, Liew said he and his coach be­lieved he had a “bronze medal chance” but that he “never said or sug­gested that what I did led to me los­ing out on a medal”.</p>
    <p>Lun then asked why Liew did not make any clar­i­fi­ca­tions when the host gave a “wrong ac­count” of his ac­tions cost­ing him a gold medal.</p>
    <p>Liew replied: “I didn’t feel what was said was un­true, so I did not feel the need or re­spon­si­bil­ity to call it out on live TV.”</p>
    <p>Ques­tioned re­peat­edly on whether he thought he could have won gold, Liew said: “It’s any­body’s game 5.5km into the race. There’s al­ways a chance in sport.</p>
    <p>“When it comes to a race, es­pe­cially a long-dis­tance race like a marathon, things are not pre­dictable es­pe­cially in con­di­tions like (on that day) which were dark and rainy and very un­ex­pected.”</p>
    <p>The run­ner was also asked about the vi­ral so­cial me­dia post by chi­ro­prac­tic men­tor Kelvin Ng, who had writ­ten about Liew’s act of sports­man­ship on the Fam­ily Health Chi­ro­prac­tic Clinic’s Face­book page. Ng had said in the post that Liew “de­serves a sports­man­ship award”.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to this, Lun asked: “If you say you’re truly hum­ble, why didn’t you nip it in the bud when Kelvin posted on Face­book back in 2015?”</p>
    <p>Liew said: “It’s not my role to cor­rect what other peo­ple feel I may be de­serv­ing of. I just do the act and let the re­sults speak from there. I have no con­trol be­hind his words and in­ten­tions... there was a slow­ing down, there was an in­ci­dent, whether that amounts to an award, I have no con­trol over.”</p>
    <p>He did not re­spond to Soh’s al­le­ga­tions and left the clar­i­fi­ca­tion to his man­ager be­cause “it is not in my na­ture to per­son­ally start a Face­book war or trade com­ments on Face­book, be­cause that’s not my style”.</p>
    <p>Soh was not present in court yes­ter­day as he is ex­pected to tes­tify next week. The hear­ing con­tin­ues to­day.</p>
    <p>BE­LATED BOLT FROM THE BLUE I was very shocked my­self when I heard the al­le­ga­tions... it was out of the blue and un­pro­voked af­ter rac­ing in 2015 and this was raised ’’ in 2018. ASH­LEY LIEW, on his re­ac­tion when two-time SEA Games cham­pion Soh Rui Yong in a Face­book post dis­puted Liew’s ac­count of an act of sports­man­ship that oc­curred dur­ing the 2015 SEA Games marathon fi­nal.</p>
    <p>LET OTH­ERS DE­CIDE It’s not my role to cor­rect what other peo­ple feel I may be de­serv­ing of. I just do the act and ’’ let the re­sults speak from there. LIEW, re­spond­ing to Clarence Lun, Soh’s lawyer, when asked why he did not clar­ify com­ments made by chi­ro­prac­tic men­tor Kelvin Ng, who said on Face­book that Liew “de­serves a sports­man­ship award”.</p>
