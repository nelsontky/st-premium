    <p>From suf­fer­ing a stroke, be­com­ing paral­ysed and then hav­ing his busi­ness shut­tered due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pro­fes­sional tat­too artist Madan­lal Aitabir ’s last six years have been an in­spir­ing jour­ney from ad­ver­sity to hope.</p>
    <p>“It just hap­pened,” says the 58-year-old of the stroke he suf­fered in 2014. He re­calls feel­ing a weak­ness in his legs and hear­ing his son, then 16, fran­ti­cally call­ing for an am­bu­lance be­fore black­ing out that fate­ful Satur­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>When he re­gained con­scious­ness at Khoo Teck Puat Hospi­tal, he could not feel his legs.</p>
    <p>He had suf­fered a stroke. Doc­tors oper­ated on him for six hours af­ter they dis­cov­ered a growth press­ing on the nerves of his lower back. De­spite the suc­cess­ful re­moval of the growth, it left him paral­ysed from the waist down.</p>
    <p>“It was the worst news I ever heard in my life. I’ve never felt so use­less,” says Mr Aitabir, who broke down when he re­ceived the news.</p>
    <p>He spent the next nine months in re­cov­ery be­fore be­ing ad­mit­ted to an SPD re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion cen­tre. SPD, pre­vi­ously known as the So­ci­ety for the Phys­i­cally Dis­abled, is a lo­cal char­ity that pro­vides ser­vices to sup­port per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Even with two years of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion, they told me my chances of walk­ing again were slim.”</p>
    <p>But the fa­ther of three re­fused to be de­feated. Af­ter 10 gru­elling months of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion, he re­gained the abil­ity to walk again.</p>
    <p>He ex­plains that the thought of be­ing a burden to his three chil­dren mo­ti­vated him to get back on his feet. “They are grown up and have their own prob­lems to deal with. I wanted to be in­de­pen­dent.”</p>
    <p>His elder son, 29, and daugh­ter, 24, are mar­ried and have their own homes. Mr Aitabir and his wife di­vorced in 2016. He now lives with his youngest son, 22, in a rental Hous­ing Board flat in Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>Calamity struck again this year. He was forced to shut­ter his tat­too stu­dio in Yishun fol­low­ing the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker mea­sures im­ple­mented on April 7.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, over the last six months, Mr Aitabir has been able to rely on his sav­ings and stay afloat by con­tin­u­ing his tat­too busi­ness from home af­ter the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were lifted on June 19.</p>
    <p>But he is most grate­ful for his health in­sur­ance plans, specif­i­cally in­te­grated shield plans (IPs), which cov­ered the to­tal cost of his es­ti­mated five-fig­ure med­i­cal and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion fees.</p>
    <p>Through­out the en­tire or­deal, Mr Aitabir shares that he was not re­quired to pay for any­thing with his own money.</p>
    <p>“If not for in­sur­ance, I would still be drown­ing in debt try­ing to pay off all the med­i­cal bills.”</p>
    <p>While he doesn’t re­mem­ber the specifics, Mr Aitabir shares that his ex-wife bought sup­ple­men­tary pri­vate health in­sur­ance for him a few years be­fore his stroke.</p>
    <p>“When I was able-bod­ied, I didn’t know how im­por­tant in­sur­ance was. Now I’ve re­alised the value of it.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion in­sur­ance, Mr Aitabir could also have ben­e­fited from other forms of health in­sur­ance cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>He would, for ex­am­ple, have re­ceived a lump sum pay­out if cov­ered un­der crit­i­cal ill­ness in­sur­ance, which cov­ers stroke.</p>
    <p>Mr Aitabir ’s re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion costs could have been cov­ered by dis­abil­ity in­sur­ance as well. He would have re­ceived a monthly ben­e­fit to sup­ple­ment his loss of in­come.</p>
