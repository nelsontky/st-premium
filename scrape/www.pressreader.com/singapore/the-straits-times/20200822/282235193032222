    <p>Sex be­low 16 years of age is an of­fence. This is the clear mes­sage that all schools need to de­liver to school chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The teach­ing of con­sent sends un­clear sig­nals to chil­dren (In­clude topic of con­sent in schools’ sex ed­u­ca­tion syl­labus, by Shahrany Has­san, Aug 19).</p>
    <p>To the ex­am­ple in the Fo­rum let­ter about go­ing on a date, it ap­pears that the young have a lot of knowl­edge but lack the abil­ity to weigh right and wrong, or that there is a gap in their com­pre­hen­sion of what had been com­mu­ni­cated prior to agree­ing to go on a date.</p>
    <p>It is un­fair to bur­den teach­ers and schools with the re­spon­si­bil­ity of teach­ing chil­dren about sex.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers al­ready have a heavy aca­demic load. This year alone, top­ics in the PSLE and O-level ex­am­i­na­tion have to be re­moved due to time con­straints.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, sex ed­u­ca­tion, un­like math­e­mat­ics or ge­og­ra­phy, for ex­am­ple, is not merely about facts but in­volves one’s val­ues.</p>
    <p>For one fam­ily, sex ed­u­ca­tion taught in school may be too lit­tle, but for an­other, it could be too much, too soon.</p>
    <p>Even teach­ers con­duct­ing sex ed­u­ca­tion classes may them­selves have a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive from what they are in­structed to teach.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren nowa­days learn a lot through “su­per teach­ers” – their smart­phones. Un­for­tu­nately, these su­per teach­ers have no sense of moral­ity.</p>
    <p>As much as a child wants to see or learn, the su­per teacher will teach and show.</p>
    <p>Per­haps a more help­ful les­son is to teach chil­dren to say “no” to sex, un­equiv­o­cally.</p>
    <p>As for par­ents, a help­ful les­son for them would be to learn to say “no” to smart­phones for chil­dren be­low a cer­tain age.</p>
