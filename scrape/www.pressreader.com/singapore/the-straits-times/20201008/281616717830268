    <p>If US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s health does hold up and the de­bate goes ahead, it will mark one of the last set-piece events be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion where Mr Trump has a chance to try and turn around his seem­ing slide to de­feat. Polls con­sis­tently show the Pres­i­dent be­hind Mr Joe Bi­den and their first de­bate on Sept 29, which im­me­di­ately de­scended into an ugly shout­ing match, shows no sign of hav­ing im­proved Mr Trump’s stand­ing with vot­ers.</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said he wants the next de­bate against his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den to go ahead de­spite his bout of coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“I am look­ing for­ward to the de­bate on the evening of Thurs­day, Oc­to­ber 15th in Mi­ami. It will be great!” Mr Trump tweeted on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The de­bate, which will be in a town hall for­mat with au­di­ence mem­bers putting ques­tions to the can­di­dates, has been thrown into doubt af­ter Mr Trump’s hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion last Fri­day with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>He was dis­charged on Mon­day and de­clared him­self on Tues­day via Twit­ter to be “Feel­ing great!”</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump’s health does hold up and the de­bate goes ahead, it will mark one of the last set-piece events be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion where Mr Trump has a chance to try and turn around his seem­ing slide to de­feat.</p>
    <p>Polls con­sis­tently show the Pres­i­dent be­hind Mr Bi­den and their first de­bate on Sept 29, which im­me­di­ately de­scended i nto an ugly shout­ing match, shows no sign of hav­ing im­proved Mr Trump’s stand­ing with vot­ers.</p>
    <p>A third and fi­nal de­bate is sched­uled for Oct 22 in Nashville.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den said he would be op­posed to de­bat­ing Mr Trump next week as sched­uled if the US Pres­i­dent is still sick with Covid-19, say­ing he would want to fol­low health guide­lines. “I’m look­ing for­ward to be­ing able to de­bate him, but I just hope all the pro­to­cols are fol­lowed,” Mr Bi­den, 77, told re­porters as he re­turned from a speech near the Civil War bat­tle­field site in Get­tys­burg on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, 74, an­nounced last Fri­day – two days af­ter his first de­bate with Mr Bi­den in Cleve­land – that he had tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>“If he still has Covid, we shouldn’t have a de­bate,” said Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion guide­lines say peo­ple who test pos­i­tive for the virus</p>
    <p>should stay home for at least 10 days af­ter symp­toms first ap­pear, while peo­ple who be­come se­verely ill might need to stay home for up to 20 days.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and Demo­cratic vice-pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Ka­mala Har­ris will face off to­day in their first and only de­bate less than a month be­fore the elec­tion, with the coro­n­avirus adding a sud­den twist to the event.</p>
    <p>The show­down be­tween vi­cepres­i­den­tial can­di­dates is more of­ten a sideshow of US pres­i­den­tial elec­tions, but this year the en­counter be­tween the two takes on far greater sig­nif­i­cance with the econ­omy stag­gered by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The de­bate will be an op­por­tu­nity for the Amer­i­can pub­lic to gauge whether Mr Pence, 61, is ready to take over for the Pres­i­dent.</p>
