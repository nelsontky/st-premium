        Insight | | B9 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 2, 2020 bear bile in Tan Re Qing, a Chinese medicine injection for respirator­y infections made popular during the Sars outbreak in 2003, which was included in a list of products recommende­d by China’s health commission as a treatment for coronaviru­s.
In the 1990s, experts in traditiona­l Chinese medicine had begun to reject the use of bear bile completely, because wild bear population­s were so low and they considered bears bred in captivity to be unsanitary. “Instead of the government taking the cue to find replacemen­ts and phase out bear farming, they continued bear farming. What happened was they merged some of the smaller unsanitary bear farms with pharmaceut­ical companies to create something more sanitary-looking,” she says.
A spokesman for Shanghai Kaibao Pharmaceut­ical Co, the leading manufactur­er of Tan Re Qing, says its technology to synthesise bear bile is not yet mature enough to make the treatment at scale. The company defends the use of farmed bears, saying they do not count as “wild animals” because they are supplied by breeding units recognised by the Chinese government.
Dr Andrew Di Salvo, a US-based wildlife veterinari­an and author of a recent study on the risks of bears as a source of zoonotic pathogens, says “possible transmissi­on of bacteria via bear bile consumptio­n would be at the top of my list of concerns” about infections, although he adds that the overall risk may be low. “While there are numerous zoonotic diseases involving other species that may pose a greater risk to humans, that by no means reduces the importance of remaining vigilant of all potential zoonotic risks,” he says.
Conservati­onists hope the pandemic will convince China’s government that promoting medicines with wild animal ingredient­s is more likely to cause the next outbreak than help cure this one. “The current ban is focused only on consumptio­n, but the virus doesn’t make a distinctio­n between trade that is legal or illegal, for food or for medicine or for exotic pets,” Ms Ge Gabriel points out.
She believes the shift towards protection can happen, as it has in the past. After China banned auctions of ivory, rhino horn and tiger bone, it led to a marked reduction in poaching, which has continued to fall. “Enforcemen­t went up, penalties were up, trade went down,” she says. “Current loopholes basically put the burden of proof on law enforcemen­t, rather than on the criminals. That needs to change.” 1985 with a mission to reintroduc­e the endangered Pere David’s deer.
Originally from northern China, the species had been hunted to extinction in China but had been successful­ly bred in captivity in the UK. The foundation’s role has since expanded to a wide range of lobbying and awareness-raising activities for endangered species in China.
For Mr Zhou, the pandemic has accelerate­d a shift that was already happening, though far too slowly. “The ordinary people are now on my side,” he says. “I disagree when people say it’s ‘tradition’. Lots of people have told me they used to eat, love to eat it. But now they won’t eat it.”
On almost a daily basis, the foundation posts about violations of wildlife trade bans, as a network of volunteers across the country informs it of illegal exotic bird markets or poachers.
The reclassifi­cation of the pangolin as a first-class protected species last month, and its removal from the Chinese Pharmacopo­eia of ingredient­s for medicine, is a key victory for Mr Zhou. Protecting the endangered creature has been a priority for the foundation and he keeps a stuffed toy pangolin on his desk.
He says there used to be between 10,000 and 20,000 wild pangolins in Hunan province alone, but in recent years conservati­on groups have found only 20 in China.
The group has also begun using the courts to protect wildlife and Mr Zhou hopes Covid-19 will make that easier. Among the biggest shifts since the outbreak began is a beefing-up of the laws governing wildlife trade, as well as stricter punishment­s for those who break them.
The main problems holding back progress towards stricter bans are “business and money”, Mr Zhou says. “Those are the forces that are doing all they can to attack us, to push back.”
He points out that the ancient texts that much of traditiona­l Chinese medicine is based on talk about pangolin scales as being “toxic” and an “inferior medicine” that should be used sparingly, if at all. “It was after reform and opening that people started to market the idea (of pangolin being medicinal) to make money.”
Ms Grace Ge Gabriel, Asia regional director for the Internatio­nal Fund for Animal Welfare, believes Beijing could make the shift from wildlife trading happen if it decided to, by including compensati­on for farmers and incentives to switch industries.
“The whole disaster is caused by the legal loopholes,” she says. “The basis of China’s wildlife protection law was wrong. It’s a wildlife protection law in name only. The law is more about protecting the utilisatio­n of wild animals, rather than protecting them for their ecological value in the wild.”
Ms Ge Gabriel points to the use of unwanted male chicks from chicken farms that only need hens to lay eggs. He admits eating snake isn’t for everyone, but says many people still want the option, particular­ly on special occasions. “It’s not like chicken, duck or fish, which you can have three times a day. It’s more like you have it once a month or in the winter you take a portion to your parents.”
One of the main reasons people eat snake is a belief that the meat has medicinal properties to “dispel wind and remove dampness” — especially useful in the clammy southern Chinese heat, he says.
Even with the ban, the wildlife business in Guangzhou has not disappeare­d. Traders in the city’s largest Chinese medicine market are selling Heilongjia­ng snow frogs, which have yet to be whiteliste­d by the government, alongside the usual legal fare such as antelope penis and antler. Some traders say they could obtain other wildlife products if needed. “Wild are definitely better than people-made options – everyone in Chinese medicine says so. Wild are also more expensive than bred, because they are harder to find and are more effective,” says one stall owner.
Wildlife breeding is not the sole risk factor in preventing epidemics; sales practices are also a concern. Although it is far from common, some Chinese cities host urban markets that sell various live wild animals. The sale of live domesticat­ed farm animals in markets is also problemati­c. While both Sars and Covid-19 most likely originated in wildlife, the traditiona­l farming, transporta­tion and sale of these animals also pose significan­t dangers for the spread of zoonotic diseases.
The country has faced an epidemic of African swine fever in pig farms and, since 1997, Guangdong’s live poultry markets have battled frequent seasonal outbreaks of avian influenza virus.
In June, China’s markets were thrown back into the spotlight for a second time, when a new cluster of cases in Beijing was linked to the largest wholesale market in the city.
After a citywide testing drive, the municipal government found more than 300 cases linked to Xinfadi, a large warehouse in south-west Beijing where farmers sold meat, fish, vegetables and other goods.
The exact source of the resurgence remains unclear, but Chinese officials have suggested it may have been imported from Europe on frozen produce, an explanatio­n that some epidemiolo­gists have labelled unlikely. In response to the outbreak, Beijing closed the marketplac­e and its sellers were redirected to a facility in neighbouri­ng Hebei province.
Guangzhou’s markets have also come under even greater scrutiny in response to the pandemic. In the Jiangcun live poultry market, stall owners complain that new measures to prevent infections have hampered trade.
“Business is much worse – about half of what it was last year,” says breeder Zhou Guoxiong, who has been in the business for more than 25 years. “In January (in a nearby market), some people were arrested for selling wild animals after an undercover newspaper report and we weren’t allowed to open here until March.”
After reopening, sellers were no longer allowed to let customers take away live chickens and had to slaughter them on site, which defeats the market’s main selling point, the breeder says. “Who in Guangzhou eats frozen chicken?”
An expanding middle class has also created a market for household pets. But the prevailing nervousnes­s led to Guangzhou’s major pet market, Huadiwan, which has areas dedicated to selling fish, birds, cats and dogs, being partially dismantled this year, with many shopkeeper­s asked to move out. The stores that used to sell more exotic species can be spotted easily by the missing characters that have been cut out of their signs.
Owner Liu Yiding of Tangchao, a well-known reptile pet shop that used to be based in Huadiwan, has already moved to a new location. On a quiet morning, the shop is being cleaned as workers feed crickets to the lizards and toads. “We have been to the forestry bureau to seek advice and we want to apply for a formal business licence, but there is no appropriat­e permit for us to apply for, so we are in a grey zone,” says the owner.
The regulators have been caught up in the constant policy updates almost as much as sellers and breeders. The rapid pace of change has made it hard for even the forestry administra­tion to give straight answers at times. One forestry official in Guangdong says that the bureau receives a vast number of requests about what can be bred or sold. “It’s not like you can search on Baidu and find the latest informatio­n. There are some that could be bred before but it’s not clear now whether they will be allowed,” he says.
Work to inform the public hasn’t been great, he admits, especially explaining the science behind decisions. “Overall, the interests of farmers and small businesses haven’t been very well respected.” WAKE-UP CALL Few in China have been more active in pushing the National Forestry and Grassland Administra­tion to crack down on the illegal wildlife trade than Mr Zhou Jinfeng, head of the China Biodiversi­ty Conservati­on and Green Developmen­t Foundation.
“Covid-19 is a disaster but it’s a good lesson, a wake-up call,” he says. The foundation was created in FINANCIAL TIMES • Christian Shepherd is the FT’s Beijing correspond­ent.
