    <p>CON­CERT BACK TO LIVE (DAY 1)</p>
    <p>Sands The­atre, Ma­rina Bay Sands/ Last Fri­day</p>
    <p>From manda­tory pre-show swab tests for the au­di­ence to mu­si­cians safely dis­tanc­ing from one an­other on stage, the Back To Live con­cert at the Sands The­atre, Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS), last Fri­day was the most heav­ily reg­u­lated gig I had ever been to.</p>
    <p>Be­sides solid per­for­mances by home-grown singers Ben­jamin Kheng and Sezairi, it also fea­tured guests Narelle, Liny­ing and rap­per TheLionCi­tyBoy.</p>
    <p>These are not nor­mal times for mu­sic fans, of course.</p>
    <p>The con­cert, the first of a twonight show, was part of the Min­istry of Health’s pre-event test­ing pi­lot pro­gramme to help kick-start the lo­cal en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try bat­tered by Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond part of the con­cert took place last Satur­day with singers Char­lie Lim, Aisyah Aziz and Keyana.</p>
    <p>It was not my first con­cert since live per­for­mances were al­lowed again in Septem­ber, but the pre­vi­ous ones were small-scale gigs with very small au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>This one at MBS at­tracted more than 400 peo­ple, said the or­gan­is­ers, the big­gest au­di­ence since March and hence the ex­tra safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>I ar­rived at MBS 31/ hours be­fore</p>
    <p>2 the 9pm show time to take the swab test. The pro­ce­dure was smooth – it was pain­less and the whole process took about five min­utes. Half an hour later, I re­ceived a neg­a­tive re­sult from MOH – the nec­es­sary re­quire­ment to get into the con­cert.</p>
    <p>In the venue, groups of up to five each and sin­gle-seat fans were spaced far apart on the three lev­els of the 2,155-ca­pac­ity the­atre.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing and danc­ing were for­bid­den, but they clapped and cheered loudly when the per­form­ers took to the stage.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept for the singers, the mu­si­cians on stage wore masks, as did the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>When Liny­ing ap­peared on stage for a duet with Sezairi on the lat­ter’s new sin­gle Rain­drops, they stood a few me­tres apart.</p>
    <p>Sezairi put on a slick per­for­mance of mostly orig­i­nal funk and R&B tunes, and the vel­vety vo­cals that helped him win Sin­ga­pore Idol back in 2009 had not di­min­ished.</p>
    <p>“I know you can’t dance, but jig­gle your butt in your seat, okay?,” he quipped.</p>
    <p>Kheng’s gospel-tinged pop tunes from his re­cent de­but solo EP, A Sea That Never Stops, sounded much more riv­et­ing live com­pared with the recorded ver­sions.</p>
    <p>He had a charis­matic stage pres­ence and got the au­di­ence to clap along to sev­eral songs.</p>
    <p>Both Sezairi and Kheng per­formed for 45 min­utes each and there were no en­cores af­ter they sang their last songs.</p>
    <p>In the venue, there were plenty of ush­ers to guide au­di­ence mem­bers around and en­sure they did not con­gre­gate.</p>
    <p>When a man at­tempted to talk to an­other group, he was quickly in­ter­cepted by an usher who re­minded him to stay in his seat.</p>
    <p>As a hardcore mu­sic fan starved of live shows, I did not mind hav­ing to put up with the in­con­ve­nience – if that is what it takes to en­joy live gigs again and help re­vive the ail­ing mu­sic in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Sure, the ex­tra mea­sures took away some of the vis­ceral joy of see­ing mu­si­cians per­form­ing in the flesh.</p>
    <p>Still, the con­cert seemed like a small step for­ward for the live mu­sic in­dus­try to re­store its prepan­demic buzz while keep­ing fans, artists and ev­ery­one in­volved in the shows safe.</p>
