    <p>The “woke” move­ment seems to be gain­ing trac­tion among the young people of Singapore to­day, judg­ing from social me­dia com­ments.</p>
    <p>This should be a mat­ter of some con­cern for ev­ery­one, whether or not you iden­tify as woke, or so­cially aware, and even if you have no opin­ion on “wokeism” what­so­ever.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause ex­ces­sive ad­her­ence to woke con­cepts can have rather more se­ri­ous con­se­quences than de­vo­tion to K-drama or sports teams.</p>
    <p>The ba­sic premise of be­ing woke is fairly sim­ple to un­der­stand in it­self. The term “woke” has seen wide­spread us­age in the West for some years, and was added to the Ox­ford English Dic­tionary in 2017 as: “Orig­i­nally: well in­formed, up to date. Now chiefly: alert to racial or social dis­crim­i­na­tion and in­jus­tice”.</p>
    <p>So if you are woke, your eyes are opened to var­i­ous so­ci­etal in­jus­tices, and you try your best not to per­pet­u­ate them and to raise aware­ness about them. You are also pre­pared to take a stand against them by, for ex­am­ple, cen­sur­ing a friend or fam­ily mem­ber for a racist re­mark, or call­ing for pol­icy changes on social me­dia.</p>
    <p>Sounds like a good thing, right? Sure, but there can also be too much of a good thing.</p>
    <p>Make no mis­take: I whole­heart­edly be­lieve in what “wokeism” – as the woke move­ment is some­times called – pur­ports to achieve.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that I would rather live in a so­ci­ety that is re­spect­ful of in­di­vid­ual dif­fer­ences and of­fers equal op­por­tu­nity to all, rather than in one where dis­crim­i­na­tion and in­equal­ity are part of the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>En­trenched stereo­types and bi­ases held by the ma­jor­ity, the wealthy and the pow­er­ful can and of­ten do un­fairly stack the deck against mi­nor­ity groups.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I can­not help but be dis­mayed by the toxic by-prod­ucts gen­er­ated by in­creas­ingly prom­i­nent strains of wokeism: con­flict in­stead of com­pas­sion, con­stricted si­lence in­stead of open con­ver­sa­tion, and far too many “truths” and not enough grace.</p>
    <p>There are three ways, I think, by which wokeism can be taken too far and be­come too much of a good thing.</p>
    <p>Firstly, it is a short slip­pery slope from tak­ing a firm stand against dis­crim­i­na­tion to self-right­eous bul­ly­ing and os­traci­sa­tion, es­pe­cially when be­hind the veil of In­ter­net anonymity.</p>
    <p>So-called “can­cel cul­ture”, for in­stance, is an ex­ten­sion of woke mind­sets that in­volves deny­ing money, at­ten­tion or sup­port for com­pa­nies or people that are per­ceived to have of­fended oth­ers through what they say or do.</p>
    <p>The un­der­ly­ing as­sump­tion is that if you dis­agree with what some­one has said, you have the right to pun­ish them, all the more so if there are enough people who agree with you.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent past tar­gets in­clude Harry Pot­ter au­thor J. K. Rowl­ing, who was judged to have tweeted re­marks of­fen­sive to trans­sex­ual people last June.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, celebrity blog­ger Xi­axue was dropped by spon­sors last year af­ter a po­lice re­port was made against her for al­legedly racist re­marks tweeted in 2010.</p>
    <p>But can­cel cul­ture has also made a vic­tim of an African-Amer­i­can high school se­cu­rity guard who lost his job in 2019 for us­ing an African-Amer­i­can racial slur while telling an African-Amer­i­can stu­dent not to di­rect the word at him.</p>
    <p>There are times to be force­ful when push­ing for change, but I am not sure that pun­ish­ing people for in­nocu­ous re­marks taken out of con­text can count as a vic­tory of any kind.</p>
    <p>If the goal is har­mony and a shared re­spect be­tween dif­fer­ent groups in so­ci­ety, then there is noth­ing to be gained from hyper-vig­i­lantly polic­ing other people’s words and thoughts, wait­ing to pounce on their “mis­takes”.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing ex­cept a smug sense of moral su­pe­ri­or­ity, which is used to boost one’s ego or salve one’s con­science. We can and should be bet­ter than this.</p>
    <p>Se­condly, there is also a slip­pery slope from carv­ing out a space for all shades of iden­tity to co­ex­ist, to en­abling the weapon­i­sa­tion of th­ese iden­ti­ties and ac­cen­tu­at­ing the dif­fer­ences be­tween people in­stead.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is one of de­gree, and I think it fair to say that there is a clear dif­fer­ence be­tween of­fer­ing re­spect­ful re­minders on mi­nor­ity view­points, and ag­gres­sively thrust­ing said view­points in the face of people who may not even be about to of­fend you.</p>
    <p>One is need­ful, the other, at best, self-in­dul­gent and en­ti­tled.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, I am a</p>
    <p>Chi­nese male and also a left-handed twin with a predilec­tion for minia­ture schnauzers and ex­tremely long nov­els.</p>
    <p>Sup­pose I live in a ma­tri­ar­chal so­ci­ety of a cer­tain cul­ture, where be­ing a Chi­nese male is a stig­ma­tised mi­nor­ity.</p>
    <p>If some­one who loves minia­ture schnauzers strikes up a con­ver­sa­tion with me, then the sim­i­lar­ity is nat­u­rally what we fo­cus on and how we re­late to each other.</p>
    <p>I don’t have to force him or her to re­late to me as a Chi­nese male, or to ac­knowl­edge the dis­crim­i­na­tion I may feel life­long as a Chi­nese male, es­pe­cially if they are nei­ther Chi­nese nor male and do­ing so only makes them un­com­fort­ably aware of how we are dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ply this un­com­fort­able aware­ness a thou­sand times for ev­ery per­son we might have to com­mu­ni­cate with across just one year, and you get an idea of how di­vi­sive a rigid overem­pha­sis on cer­tain aspects of iden­tity can be.</p>
    <p>What we will end up with, in the worst case sce­nario, is a so­ci­ety carved into thou­sands of pock­ets of mi­cro-iden­ti­ties, each vir­u­lently hos­tile to all oth­ers for the sim­ple crime of be­ing dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>We are all made of com­pos­ite iden­ti­ties. While be­ing woke sen­si­tises us to in­jus­tice, be­ing hu­man and con­sid­er­ate also teaches us to em­pha­sise com­mon iden­ti­ties, not al­ways pick at dif­fer­en­ti­ated ones.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, the strong emo­tions aroused by wokeism can equally be har­nessed to ef­fect gen­uine change or be ex­ploited to serve the agenda of ma­li­cious, op­por­tunis­tic in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Capi­tol Hill ri­ots in the United States demon­strated just how much dam­age an emo­tional mob can do to a hal­lowed so­ci­etal in­sti­tu­tion when in­cited by a suf­fi­ciently pow­er­ful and un­scrupu­lous per­son.</p>
    <p>Young people at­tracted to woke ideas must be alert to the pos­si­bil­ity that their good in­ten­tions can turn ran­cid.</p>
    <p>The irony is that, at its most per­ni­cious, wokeism can be­come ex­actly what it says it is fight­ing – an ide­o­log­i­cal sledgehamm­er that brooks no dis­sent and cre­ates a new un­think­ing bi­nary be­tween those who are woke, and those who are not. Wokeism at its worst cre­ates a new in-group and out-group.</p>
    <p>Sen­si­ble woke people un­der­stand this and ex­er­cise their social con­scious­ness with con­sid­er­a­tion, and do not de­mand that oth­ers come on board the jour­ney im­me­di­ately, or leave the ves­sel.</p>
    <p>I doubt I am alone in be­ing scep­ti­cal and a lit­tle wor­ried about the ex­cesses of the woke move­ment and would en­cour­age those with sim­i­lar con­cerns to voice them.</p>
    <p>If not, we are tac­itly al­low­ing the more vo­cal and ex­treme ad­her­ents of wokeism to shape and dom­i­nate dis­course just be­cause they are will­ing to be louder, to the point that their mes­sage be­comes the only mes­sage.</p>
    <p>And if that is what be­ing woke means, then I would much rather stay asleep.</p>
