    <p>For peo­ple stuck on ei­ther side of the Cause­way, the pos­si­ble re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia is cause for op­ti­mism.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties of both coun­tries agreed last week to restart cross­bor­der travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial trav­ellers and longterm pass hold­ers through two schemes: the re­cip­ro­cal green lane and the pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Though more de­tails will be an­nounced be­fore these new travel schemes take ef­fect on Aug 10, trav­ellers will have to get swabbed for Covid-19 and sub­mit their itin­er­ar­ies to the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, more than 300,000 trav­ellers had used the Cause­way ev­ery day. Among these were about 100,000 Malaysians who com­muted daily be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Since Malaysia shut its bor­der on March 18, a num­ber of them have ei­ther lost their jobs in Sin­ga­pore or have had to en­dure lengthy sep­a­ra­tion from their fam­i­lies in Jo­hor Baru.</p>
    <p>NOT AP­PLI­CA­BLE TO ALL</p>
    <p>It is still un­clear who will qual­ify for the green lane and pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>De­tails are vague for now, said Ms Aarathi Aru­mugam, pres­i­dent of the Malaysian As­so­ci­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion has helped de­fray ac­com­mo­da­tion costs for about 70 Malaysians stuck here, some of whom have since quit their jobs and re­turned to Malaysia, ow­ing to the higher costs of liv­ing here.</p>
    <p>“For those who have been wait­ing it out in hopes of re­turn­ing to daily com­mut­ing, I don’t think that will hap­pen any time soon. And it does not seem like these schemes will ap­ply to them,” said Ms Aru­mugam, not­ing that the green lane is tar­geted at travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing said in a Bloomberg in­ter­view in May that se­nior man­age­ment for multi­na­tional com­pa­nies and skilled tech­ni­cians who need to main­tain crit­i­cal sys­tems around the world will qual­ify as es­sen­tial busi­ness trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Ms Aru­mugam said the Malaysians most af­fected by the bor­der clo­sures are those in the lower-in­come bracket, who have had to bear ad­di­tional ex­penses to re­main here and keep their jobs as en­gi­neers, security of­fi­cers and clean­ers, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>She said the ideal sit­u­a­tion would be for them to re­turn to com­mut­ing on a daily ba­sis. “But that is not what is be­ing dis­cussed right now (by the au­thor­i­ties),” said Ms Aru­mugam, adding that the pri­or­ity now is to avoid a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions that some coun­tries are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>Last month, Sin­ga­pore also es­tab­lished a re­cip­ro­cal green lane with China for res­i­dents who need to make es­sen­tial busi­ness or of­fi­cial trips be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>These trav­ellers have to get swabbed in both coun­tries at their own ex­pense. They are also re­quired to be spon­sored by a com­pany or a lo­cal gov­ern­ment agency, which will file for en­try ap­proval on their be­half. They do not have to serve the 14-day quar­an­tine but have to stick to a pre-ap­proved itinerary.</p>
    <p>COSTS OF THE CLO­SURES</p>
    <p>The bor­der clo­sure and move­ment con­trol or­der have cost the Jo­hor state gov­ern­ment a more than 20 per cent loss in rev­enue, Jo­hor Men­teri Be­sar Hasni Mo­ham­mad told Malaysian me­dia last month. He said the losses were due to taxes and charges that could not be col­lected and a drop in in­vest­ment ac­tiv­i­ties and tourist ar­rivals from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, in­dus­tries that rely heav­ily on work­ers from Malaysia, such as ren­o­va­tion and security ser­vices, have been hit by the bor­der clo­sure. Ac­cord­ing to Sin­ga­pore Ren­o­va­tion Con­trac­tors and Ma­te­rial Sup­pli­ers As­so­ci­a­tion, about 80 per cent of work­ers in the ren­o­va­tion trade are Malaysians and most of them are stuck in Malaysia. They in­clude pain­ters, car­pen­ters and elec­tri­cians.</p>
    <p>The short­age of skilled work­ers means that ren­o­va­tion projects here are de­layed and ren­o­va­tion costs have gone up, said Mr Al­loyious Koh, chief cre­ative con­sul­tant of Car­pen­ters De­sign Group.</p>
    <p>In the past three months, Mr Koh, 29, has tried ap­ply­ing for en­try per­mits for his work­ers who used to com­mute daily to Sin­ga­pore, but it was only last week that he got one such ap­pli­ca­tion ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, security agency boss Gary Haris, 44, has been ap­ply­ing for en­try per­mits for 30 of his Malaysian of­fi­cers stuck across the Cause­way. Three were granted ap­proval to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore last week. He will have to pay around $2,200 for each worker’s manda­tory Covid-19 swab test and stay at a ded­i­cated stay-home no­tice fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Many of them have waited for the ap­proval and did not quit on us, so the com­pany is will­ing to foot the bill,” said Mr Haris.</p>
    <p>But this could mean a higher cost for hir­ing Malaysians in the fu­ture, he added, as em­ploy­ers now have to source ac­com­mo­da­tion for the work­ers who can no longer com­mute be­tween the two coun­tries daily. “We might think twice about em­ploy­ing Malaysians from now on,” he said.</p>
    <p>Swab tests are also com­pul­sory for those en­ter­ing Malaysia, and for Malaysians this costs from RM30 (S$10) to about RM160, de­pend­ing on the type of test used. For­eign­ers pay about twice the price for the same tests.</p>
    <p>WAIT­ING TO CROSS THE BOR­DER</p>
    <p>Liveli­hoods and re­la­tion­ships are on the line, as many stuck on ei­ther side of the bor­der start weigh­ing their op­tions af­ter months of no in­come or sep­a­ra­tion from their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Malaysian car­pen­ter Chong Yuo, 36, used to travel to Sin­ga­pore for work four times a week. But now, the fa­ther of two is stuck in Malaysia and has had no in­come in the last three months. Be­fore the bor­der closed, he earned $5,000 monthly. He is pre­pared to move to Sin­ga­pore for work if daily com­mut­ing is no longer an op­tion.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally can­not go on with­out in­come for much longer,” said Mr Chong.</p>
    <p>For Mr Push­par­raj Kalai­sel­van, 33, a store­man at an avi­a­tion firm, pay cuts and the higher cost of liv­ing here have eaten into his sav­ings.</p>
    <p>He used to re­turn home to JB ev­ery night but has been pay­ing about $300 monthly to stay at a hos­tel here. To con­tinue sup­port­ing his re­tired par­ents, he tries to send back most of his $900 salary, even if it means eat­ing bread ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>“My fa­ther has been ask­ing me to re­turn home as he misses me. But for me, the pri­or­ity is to keep my job. It’s tough, but I have no choice.”</p>
