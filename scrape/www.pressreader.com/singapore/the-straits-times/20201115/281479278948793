    <p>II am de­mand­ing only be­cause it’s al­ways to strive for per­fec­tion... I am not one that rests. MS JAN­ICE WONG on her work­ing style.</p>
    <p>n 2005 when she was 21, pas­try chef Jan­ice Wong was in such a bad car ac­ci­dent that her right leg nearly had to be am­pu­tated. She was on an ex­change study pro­gramme in Aus­tralia and trav­el­ling with her then-fi­ance and her best friend. Their car had just dis­em­barked from the Mel­bourne-Tas­ma­nia ferry when a drunk driver crashed into them.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore palate is very fickle be­cause they go for what is very pop­u­lar or In­sta­grammable. But the Sin­ga­pore palate is also very so­phis­ti­cated. We can tell a good from a bad in­gre­di­ent and are will­ing to pay more for higher qual­ity. MS JAN­ICE WONG</p>
    <p>She was read­ing a map and hadn’t had time to put on her seat belt, and the car’s airbag also failed to in­flate. She was smashed against the wind­screen.</p>
    <p>“I have 30 stitches here,” she says, lean­ing over and point­ing to her fore­head. “You can see some marks here and there. The makeup doesn’t cover all of it.”</p>
    <p>She suf­fered trauma on the left side of her brain.</p>
    <p>The in­jury on her right leg also got badly in­fected. “I was in Mel­bourne and the doc­tor told me if I didn’t get my surgery done right away, they would have to am­pu­tate. I freaked out,” she re­counts mat­ter-of-factly.</p>
    <p>Her ex-fi­ance es­caped with a few cuts but her best friend had fa­cial and leg in­juries. Luck­ily, they all healed well. The driver of the other car was not hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>One good thing came out of the ac­ci­dent. For some rea­son – maybe her brain got rewired – she be­came more cre­ative.</p>
    <p>Up to that point, the eco­nom­ics un­der­grad­u­ate at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore was look­ing at a ca­reer in bank­ing.</p>
    <p>“In univer­sity, col­lege, I was do­ing higher math­e­mat­ics. But after that, I started to cook and paint. I started to buy brushes and paint and stuff. It’s a very in­ter­est­ing jour­ney.”</p>
    <p>Fif­teen years on, her life has cer­tainly been fas­ci­nat­ing.</p>
    <p>After she grad­u­ated in eco­nom­ics, Ms Wong em­barked on a ca­reer as a pas­try chef.</p>
    <p>Food had al­ways been a pas­sion. In her early years, she was ex­posed to dif­fer­ent types of dishes while liv­ing in Ja­pan and Hong Kong, where her bank-trader fa­ther was posted. Her stint in Aus­tralia got her en­thu­si­as­tic about the wine, cheese and fresh pro­duce there.</p>
    <p>Over the years, her beau­ti­ful sweets, un­usual flavours and con­stant stream of am­bi­tious new projects have kept her in the pub­lic eye.</p>
    <p>New pas­try chefs come and go, but she re­mains Sin­ga­pore’s queen of desserts, even as there are some who feel her cre­ations are too avant garde for the av­er­age Sin­ga­porean palate and also not easy on the pocket.</p>
    <p>A tiramisu at her 2am:dessert­bar in Hol­land Vil­lage costs $18 and a box of five cho­co­late bon­bons is $25, al­though one pays for the qual­ity and in­tri­cate work.</p>
    <p>She has be­come fa­mous for her “ed­i­ble art” where she trans­forms rooms into won­der­lands of sug­ary treats. There was a ceil­ing cov­ered with marsh­mal­low “ici­cles”, and Jack­son Pol­lock-style paint­ings cre­ated from fruit puree.</p>
    <p>Her ed­i­ble art has been ex­hib­ited around the world, she has won awards, been a Sin­ga­pore food en­voy, con­ducted work­shops, writ­ten books and been on re­al­ity cook­ing shows.</p>
    <p>Her cre­ativ­ity and at­ten­tion to her craft have marked her as an artist, which is also how she sees her­self.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, she was fea­tured in the doc­u­men­tary movie Ot­tolenghi And The Cakes Of Ver­sailles.</p>
    <p>Yo­tam Ot­tolenghi is a fa­mous London-based restau­ra­teur and cook­book au­thor. The movie shows him bring­ing to­gether some of the world’s best patissiers to cre­ate a spread in­spired by what might have been served at the court of Ver­sailles, as part of an ex­hi­bi­tion at New York’s Metropoli­tan Mu­seum of Art.</p>
    <p>One of Ms Wong’s cre­ations – a chest­nut quince cake with lemon curd, chan­tilly and cho­co­late chest­nut mousse – is used in the movie’s poster.</p>
    <p>MEET­ING A MEN­TOR</p>
    <p>We’re meet­ing at Gun­ther’s, the well-re­spected French restau­rant in Purvis Street.</p>
    <p>In pub­lic­ity photos, Ms Wong is al­ways in a white or black chef uni­form, so it’s a change to see her in a bright green dress – “colour is life,” she says later. She doesn’t carry a hand­bag, just her phone. Her car, which is parked along­side the restau­rant, is an or­ange BMW 1 se­ries.</p>
    <p>At 37, she’s tech­ni­cally a mil­len­nial but her man­ner is older. She’s pleas­ant and friendly but there’s also a grave air. My col­leagues cov­er­ing the food beat say she has al­ways been se­ri­ous, even in her 20s.</p>
    <p>She’s un­der­stated about her ac­com­plish­ments but when you hear her story, there’s no doubt­ing just how driven she is.</p>
    <p>She’s cho­sen this restau­rant be­cause Chef Gun­ther Hubrech­sen, the owner-chef, was a men­tor when she did a stint at Sin­ga­pore’s Les Amis restau­rant back in the mid-2000s.</p>
    <p>“He’s one of the best, most com­mit­ted chefs,” she says. “He was very sup­port­ive of my cook­ing ca­reer and he taught me a lot.”</p>
    <p>Chef Hubrech­sen makes an ap­pear­ance. They haven’t seen each other for years and greet warmly but not ex­trav­a­gantly.</p>
    <p>We’ve been given a pri­vate room and, it ap­pears, we’re also get­ting a spe­cial feast.</p>
    <p>The waiter en­ters with a gi­ant Alaskan king crab on a big sil­ver plat­ter. “Hi ladies, this will be part of your meal to­day,” he an­nounces.</p>
    <p>See­ing our sur­prise, he clar­i­fies that we’ll just be get­ting a por­tion of the crab.</p>
    <p>When he leaves the room, Ms Wong turns to me and asks: “What is usu­ally in the menu?”</p>
    <p>I’m not sure, I say. I don’t see a menu around. I sus­pect that she – like me – had been plan­ning to or­der a sim­ple set lunch.</p>
    <p>“Okay, maybe we can ask them later,” she says.</p>
    <p>I ask her about the movie – avail­able on stream­ing chan­nels – which was filmed in 2018.</p>
    <p>She’d met Ot­tolenghi in</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia about 10 years ago where they did an event un­der the Sydney Bridge.</p>
    <p>“He called me and said, ‘do you want to do this’? And I said, ‘yes, for sure’. I guess he thought of me be­cause I was in all the ed­i­ble art stuff and he needed the di­ver­sity of chefs,” she says mod­estly.</p>
    <p>The waiter re­turns with our first course, the house spe­cial of cold an­gel hair pasta with Osci­etra caviar. We take the chance to ask him what we’ll be eat­ing.</p>
    <p>Would you like it to be a sur­prise, he asks.</p>
    <p>We’d like to know, we say.</p>
    <p>After the pasta will be carpac­cio of Ja­panese beef on crispy po­tato, he lets on. We’ll then have grilled Sumi squid with pars­ley and gar­lic, to be fol­lowed by the main dish of smoked Alaskan king crab leg.</p>
    <p>All these dishes, when they ar­rive, are de­li­cious. She raves es­pe­cially about the carpac­cio’s thin sheet of po­tato which is al­most airy – “it’s like, wow”.</p>
    <p>I no­tice she is a fast eater and cleans her plate.</p>
    <p>COVID-19 CHAL­LENGES</p>
    <p>Just be­fore Covid-19 flared up, she was in Ja­pan where she had six Valen­tine’s Day pop-ups across Tokyo and Osaka.</p>
    <p>Back in Sin­ga­pore in mid-Fe­bru­ary and with a lock­down im­mi­nent, she knew she had to do some­thing to keep her 28 em­ploy­ees here work­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the 2am:dessert­bar which she started in 2007, she has two out­lets, in Raf­fles City and Paragon, and a kitchen in Tai Seng.</p>
    <p>She also has an out­let in Seoul and is plan­ning 10 Valen­tine’s Day shops in Ja­pan next year.</p>
    <p>“I ac­tu­ally thought I would build it big­ger than what it is now,” she says of her business. But be­ing small has been a bless­ing in the pandemic, as other­wise she’d be wor­ried about the huge fi­nan­cial bur­den of more out­lets and the fate of em­ploy­ees over­seas.</p>
    <p>While F&B sec­tors like bak­eries are thriving be­cause they are essen­tials, a business like hers that is big on gift­ing and sou­venirs is chal­lenged.</p>
    <p>“What I’ve learnt is to re­ally be lean but also to be very dif­fer­ent, be­cause you are al­ways your own com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>To “bring the Jan­ice Wong ex­pe­ri­ence to your home” dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, she switched to de­liv­er­ies and also launched a Bake At Home se­ries of cake pre-mix and bak­ing kits.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery was tricky: How to trans­port a wob­bly hot tart meant to be served with ice cream?</p>
    <p>Her team ex­per­i­mented. A tart was placed in­side a box and put on a mo­tor­bike to a dis­tance 30 min­utes away. Sur­pris­ingly, it sur­vived. This could work. The ice cream was then packed separately and a video made to show cus­tomers how they could as­sem­ble the dessert.</p>
    <p>Her pre-mix – com­pet­i­tively priced from $4.20 for a packet that will give you 35 madeleines to $9.40 for a cho­co­late cake – was a hit with more than 5,000 sold.</p>
    <p>She did ev­ery­thing from com­ing up with the pre-mix recipes for 20 dif­fer­ent prod­ucts to film­ing how-to videos.</p>
    <p>Do you bake, she asks me.</p>
    <p>I tell her I tried dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker but my cook­ies al­ways turned out badly. She says I should try her pre-mix and phones an em­ployee to send one over.</p>
    <p>While she will of­fer the pre-mix through Christ­mas, she is not sure she will con­tinue as mar­gins are smaller and the work done by hand.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has seen the F&B in­dus­try work­ing more closely to­gether and col­lab­o­rat­ing. She has paired up with the bar Jig­ger & Pony and restau­rant Po­tato Head.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the re­lease of the Ot­tolenghi movie, she launched a Ver­sailles-themed high tea at 2am:dessert­bar, which did well.</p>
    <p>I ask Ms Wong, who is sin­gle and has a younger brother work­ing in fi­nance, if she sees her­self more as a chef or an artist. “Both. Some months more art, some months more chef. This year, chef, be­cause I have to pivot so much. I have to cook so much these days.”</p>
    <p>What ad­vice would she give as­pir­ing pas­try chefs?</p>
    <p>She of­fers two: iden­tity and in­no­va­tion. “You can learn as much as you want, but you must have a core iden­tity and it must show on the plate.”</p>
    <p>For Gun­ther’s, it is high qual­ity, clas­sic French food. For her, it is about in­no­va­tion and sweet ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t have that and you just go with trends, then it’s very hard to go the long, long way.”</p>
    <p>That said, a chef should also be able to in­no­vate.</p>
    <p>“The com­pe­ti­tion is real,” she says. “At some point, if you don’t keep up with in­no­va­tion, peo­ple will start to for­get you. So it’s not that we have done much in the past or done well, I al­ways think it’s about the present.”</p>
    <p>The waiter re­turns with an im­pres­sive cheese spread but we are stuffed and just get a few slices. Dessert is mille-feuille. I ask her to cri­tique it but she re­fuses. Could she de­scribe it then? “Very nice, clas­sic, French puff pas­try with cof­fee.”</p>
    <p>As we wind up, I ask where she sees her­self in three to five years. In 2014, in­vestor Manoj Mur­jani came in as a part­ner.</p>
    <p>“To be glob­ally recog­nised and to con­tinue push­ing the bound­aries in food and ser­vice in ways unimag­in­able and in­no­va­tive.”</p>
    <p>While she’s get­ting her photo done, Chef Hubrech­sen tells me that lunch is on the house.</p>
    <p>No, no, I say, The Sun­day Times must pay. We wran­gle a bit, then he sug­gests I do­nate the amount to char­ity. I in­sist on pay­ing and he re­luc­tantly gets his staff to give me the bill.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ms Wong’s peo­ple have de­liv­ered some choco­lates for the chef and me, as well as a packet of cho­co­late cookie pre-mix which she passes to me.</p>
    <p>Try it, she says when we say good­bye.</p>
    <p>I do so the next day and the cook­ies turn out per­fect, both in look and taste.</p>
    <p>I What­sApp her a photo and back comes her en­cour­ag­ing re­ply: “Yay!! not so bad bak­ing cook­ies after all! haha.”</p>
