    <p>HOUS­TON • Many peo­ple had won­dered how the Hous­ton Rock­ets would fare this sea­son, hav­ing traded 2017 Most Valu­able Player Rus­sell West­brook for John Wall, a player who had not stepped on a court in two years due to in­jury.</p>
    <p>On the ba­sis on their past two games, as long as the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion team can keep him fit, James Harden will have a po­tent scorer be­side him.</p>
    <p>Wall recorded game-highs of 28 points, six as­sists and three steals as the hosts capped a back-to­back sweep of the Sacra­mento Kings with a 102-94 vic­tory on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Harden was a late scratch with an an­kle sprain but Hous­ton found suf­fi­cient scor­ing else­where, with Eric Gor­don also adding 21 points and a dou­ble-dou­ble by Chris­tian Wood (20 points, 15 boards).</p>
    <p>And in Wall, the Rock­ets know there will be life af­ter Harden should the NBA’s scor­ing cham­pion – he is av­er­ag­ing a league­lead­ing 37 points this term – for the past three sea­sons be traded as per his re­ported re­quest.</p>
    <p>The guard is the first player to score 50 points in his first two games – he missed their open­ing two losses due to Covid-19 pro­to­cols – af­ter an ab­sence of at least two years since Michael Jor­dan did it for the Wash­ing­ton Wizards in 2001.</p>
    <p>Rock­ets’ rookie coach Stephen Si­las has been blown away by the All-Star, whose speed and ex­plo­sive­ness were key fac­tors in him mak­ing five straight All-Star ap­pear­ances un­til 2018, when in­juries dis­rupted his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Even more im­pres­sive is that the 30-year-old ap­pears to be the Wall of old – one of the league’s best two-way play­ers.</p>
    <p>He also had two blocked shots on Satur­day, and his de­fence lim­ited ris­ing Kings star De’Aaron Fox – the guard paced his team with 23 points – to 17-of-42 shoot­ing (40.5 per cent) over the two games in Hous­ton.</p>
    <p>“What­ever ex­pec­ta­tions I had, he’s ob­vi­ously ex­ceeded them,” Si­las said af­ter his team im­proved to 2-2 this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We heard from peo­ple that said he looked good, but we didn’t know un­til we got him.”</p>
    <p>On be­ing writ­ten off as an elite player, Wall said he had not spent the past two years mop­ing about af­ter two ma­jor op­er­a­tions to re­move bone spurs in his heel and to re­pair his torn Achilles ten­don.</p>
    <p>“I just put in a lot of hard work and ded­i­ca­tion to get to this point,” he added.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t ask for a bet­ter start to be 2-0 in my first two games. When I’m healthy, I can be a lock­down de­fender. I feel like I’m the great­est shot-block­ing point guard of all time. I bring so much to the game other than scor­ing.”</p>
    <p>With four of their next five games at home and Harden set to re­turn dur­ing that se­quence, Si­las, whose team host the Dal­las Mav­er­icks to­day, is ex­pect­ing his team to im­prove fur­ther as long as they con­tinue to dis­play other facets of their play.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally buck­led down and played some de­fence,” said Si­las, who was an as­sis­tant coach for 20 years be­fore join­ing Hous­ton. “In or­der for us to be good, we have to be good on de­fence. We can’t just outscore peo­ple.”</p>
