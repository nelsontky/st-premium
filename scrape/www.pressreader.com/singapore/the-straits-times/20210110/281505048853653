    <p>Early last year, Mr Sa­muel Tan wanted to recre­ate a seafood al­fredo dish from a restau­rant he vis­ited dur­ing a trip to South Africa.</p>
    <p>This culi­nary goal was soon aban­doned in favour of some­thing far more am­bi­tious – a bid for a Guin­ness World Record.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic un­folded, the 19-year-old Nanyang Poly­tech­nic stu­dent found he had more free time, es­pe­cially dur­ing the nearly two-month cir­cuit breaker, which started on April 7 last year.</p>
    <p>He started cook­ing more, mak­ing fresh pasta for the first time. Be­fore long, he was ex­per­i­ment­ing with pulling the long­est noo­dles he could.</p>
    <p>He has a com­pet­i­tive streak and is fas­ci­nated by con­tests of ex­treme speed or en­durance. As a child, he used to en­joy run­ning on the pave­ment to race cars go­ing by. When he was in his sec­ondary school’s bowl­ing team, he wanted to bowl the fastest 300 – a per­fect score, in­volv­ing 12 strikes – among his peers. He never suc­ceeded.</p>
    <p>But he did not give up try­ing. Last year, he came across a 2017 video of his favourite celebrity chef Gor­don Ram­say pulling off a shot at the ex­ist­ing world record for the long­est sheet of pasta rolled in one minute by an in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>He re­calls think­ing: “I could do that.”</p>
    <p>He used to en­joy read­ing the Guin­ness World Records, an an­nual pub­li­ca­tion, in his child­hood.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary last year, he de­cided to aim to beat chef Ram­say’s record of mak­ing a sheet of pasta that was 1.4478m long. He lodged his ap­pli­ca­tion with the Guin­ness World Records or­gan­i­sa­tion the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>The task proved more dif­fi­cult than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>First, he had to de­ter­mine the com­bi­na­tion of flour, eggs, salt and wa­ter needed to make pasta with the op­ti­mum tex­ture and elas­tic­ity.</p>
    <p>He ex­per­i­mented with cake flour and bread flour, be­fore plump­ing for plain flour.</p>
    <p>The flour short­ages that en­sued, as masses of people took to com­fort bak­ing dur­ing Covid-19 last year, meant Mr Tan and his par­ents had to look high and low to find the brand he needed.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily ate a lot of pasta last year, Mr Tan – the youngest of three chil­dren – notes wryly.</p>
    <p>The cri­te­ria set by Guin­ness World Records were chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>For verificati­on pur­poses, he had to find pro­fes­sional wit­nesses such as a videog­ra­pher, a food safety of­fi­cer and a spe­cial­ist “with ex­per­tise in mea­sure­ment”, ac­cord­ing to the guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The last was a head-scratcher un­til Mr Tan’s fa­ther thought of ask­ing a golf­ing buddy, who had been an ac­cred­ited of­fi­cial at the pres­ti­gious Bri­tish Open golf tour­na­ment in 2019.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan later learnt that this wit­ness also had to have a rel­e­vant de­gree, such as one in ar­chi­tec­ture – which, serendip­i­tously, he did.</p>
    <p>There were times when Mr Tan was tempted to give up.</p>
    <p>“It was way too much work, but there was noth­ing to lose,” he says.</p>
    <p>The day be­fore his at­tempt at the world record on Oct 8 last year, he un­packed and promptly broke a new pasta maker, which he had planned to use to roll out the dough. It was the third one he had bro­ken dur­ing eight months of prac­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>On the day it­self, the at­mos­phere was tense with an­tic­i­pa­tion in the fam­ily’s landed home in Seran­goon.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive from Guin­ness World Records had not flown in.</p>
    <p>In­stead, a so­cially dis­tanced group of five pro­fes­sional wit­nesses gath­ered as Mr Tan pre­pared his set-up, masked, gloved and re­mind­ing him­self not to scratch his head as it would in­fringe the hy­giene reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The video footage and other doc­u­men­ta­tion of the pro­ceed­ings were later sent to the Guin­ness</p>
    <p>World Records of­fice for verificati­on.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan’s first at­tempt yielded a sheet of pasta that was 1.94m long. But he was wor­ried there might have been a slight tear in the dough, which would dis­qual­ify him. He hit 2.03m on his sec­ond try, smash­ing the Guin­ness World Record by more than 50cm.</p>
    <p>His par­ents, direc­tors at an in­vest­ment com­pany who are both 56 years old, are proud of his achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>His mother Wendy Khoo says help­ing and sup­port­ing Mr Tan in his quest has brought the fam­ily closer to­gether.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther Tony Tan is glad that his son learnt the value of re­silience through nu­mer­ous rounds of ex­per­i­men­ta­tion and prac­tice.</p>
    <p>For Mr Sa­muel Tan, lin­ger­ing feel­ings of be­ing a self-con­fessed “loser” with bad grades have been put to rest. He reck­ons he was one of t he worst stu­dents i n his sec­ondary school co­hort.</p>
    <p>He says: “I was a fail­ure last time. This was the big­gest con­fi­dence booster: You’re No. 1 in the world.”</p>
    <p>To cel­e­brate his win, he took his fam­ily out for din­ner at Bread Street Kitchen, a Gor­don Ram­say restau­rant.</p>
