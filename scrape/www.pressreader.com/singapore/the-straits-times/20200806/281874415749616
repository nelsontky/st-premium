    <p>Five months since it was thrown out of gov­ern­ment, Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) is still get­ting its house in or­der with the clock tick­ing ahead of snap polls ex­pected as soon as the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Party of­fi­cials re­vealed to The Straits Times that over 1,000 mem­bers had been sacked since de­fec­tors led by former deputy pres­i­dent Azmin Ali walked out of the party at the end of Fe­bru­ary in the so-called Sher­a­ton Move that led to the col­lapse of the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>But the cull ap­pears far from over, as those who have been loyal to pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim dur­ing the long feud with his former pro­tege are de­mand­ing their pound of flesh from those who had taken Datuk Seri Azmin’s side – re­ferred to as “the car­tel” – but chose to re­main in PKR de­spite hav­ing the chance to join the new Perikatan</p>
    <p>Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war openly chas­tised mem­bers who “have one foot here and one foot there” in a party re­treat on July 26 that was sup­posed to jump­start cam­paign mes­sag­ing. Elec­tions are loom­ing de­spite one not due till late 2023 as Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin seeks a stronger man­date than the ra­zor-thin 113 to 109 mar­gin he cur­rently has in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“Those in the cen­tral lead­er­ship coun­cil know I am the most pa­tient. When it comes to sack­ing, I dis­agree, but if it came to a vote, I would lose. But I can­not deny there is merit (in re­mov­ing dis­loyal mem­bers),” said Mr An­war, whose promised as­cen­sion to the prime min­is­ter­ship, re­plac­ing Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, un­der a PH tran­si­tion plan was foiled by the Sher­a­ton Move.</p>
    <p>The re­treat was head­lined by An­war loy­al­ists, in­clud­ing his wife and former deputy pre­mier Wan Az­izah Wan Is­mail, who in­sisted that PKR’s pres­i­dent must be PH’s prime min­is­ter can­di­date at the next elec­tions.</p>
    <p>PKR be­came the big­gest party in the 222-mem­ber Par­lia­ment with 50 MPs af­ter the 2018 polls. But this has now been re­duced to 38, fewer than its PH part­ner, the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), which along with oth­ers in the op­po­si­tion, prefers ei­ther Dr Ma­hathir, 95, or Parti Warisan Sabah chief Shafie Ap­dal to lead the next gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor Chief Mi n i s t e r Amirudin Shari was the only “car­tel” mem­ber on stage dur­ing the open­ing cer­e­mony of the July 26 “in­for­ma­tion con­ven­tion”, with the former Azmin pro­tege viewed as “re­ha­bil­i­tated” as he has openly called the de­fec­tors “traitors”.</p>
    <p>But ob­servers noted the sub­tle nudge to Datuk Seri Amirudin to show his loy­alty by plac­ing Se­lan­gor PKR youth chief Na­jwan Hal­imi on stage as a sig­nal that the lat­ter should be given a place in the state Cab­i­net. Mr Na­jwan was snubbed pre­vi­ously in favour of pro-Azmin state as­sem­bly­men.</p>
    <p>“There is still some mis­trust.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all that has hap­pened, we can’t af­ford to be naive,” said one PKR par­lia­men­tar­ian.</p>
    <p>This came hot on the heels of the launch of vice-pres­i­dent Tian Chua’s new NGO – known as Daya – the day be­fore, which was well at­tended by “car­tel” mem­bers as well as close lieu­tenants of Mr Azmin who have joined him in the PN. Mr Azmin is the Se­nior Min­is­ter for the Econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua says Daya is a non-par­ti­san plat­form to push for poli­cies that pro­mote so­cial j us­tice, but pro-An­war lead­ers have looked askance at it, be­liev­ing that for­mal party chan­nels could have been used. Many have called for Mr Chua to be sacked for pre­vi­ously sup­port­ing Mr Azmin, and he was as­saulted out­side PKR’s head­quar­ters on March 1, the day Tan Sri Muhyid­din was sworn in as pre­mier.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the party was hit by de­fec­tions, we should put all ef­forts to re­build its strength,” said a proAn­war leader.</p>
    <p>“But we also have to ac­knowl­edge that (vice-pres­i­dent) Rafizi Ramli started In­voke and it gave him a great plat­form which many now credit with help­ing us win the 2018 elec­tion,” he added, re­fer­ring to the data an­a­lyt­ics out­fit started by one of Mr An­war’s staunch­est al­lies.</p>
    <p>Former MP Chua, who, in a con­tro­ver­sial move, was dis­qual­i­fied from de­fend­ing his seat in the 2018 elec­tion, told The Straits Times that “it is time for the party to con­sol­i­date and pre­pare for polls”.</p>
    <p>“With the mar­gin in Par­lia­ment so nar­row, I un­der­stand the party’s de­sire to re­store the man­date won by PH. But we still need to en­gage the pub­lic on poli­cies that will un­der­pin our gov­ern­ment in the fu­ture,” he said.</p>
