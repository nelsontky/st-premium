    <p>Sin­ga­pore stocks ended higher yes­ter­day fol­low­ing a coronaviru­s-fu­elled stock mar­ket rally in which Wall Street booked gains, with in­vestors buoyed by news of a newly ap­proved Covid-19 vac­cine, as well as the po­ten­tial eas­ing of United States-China trade ten­sions.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times In­dex rose 20.42 points, or 0.8 per cent, to close at 2,559.03. Ad­vancers out­num­bered de­clin­ers 243 to 200, af­ter 2.97 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $1.4 bil­lion changed hands.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephen Innes, chief global mar­ket strate­gist at Ax­iCorp, said the news of a vac­cine “opens the door wide to a ro­tat­ing carousel of stocks” and “con­tin­ues to un­der­pin bet­ter sen­ti­ment” among in­vestors.</p>
    <p>He said: “While rid­ing the high per­cent­age of pan­demic win­ners, the pos­i­tive health­care news flows will of­fer in­vestors the lux­ury of buy­ing into and wait­ing for the rest of the pack to play catch-up over the com­ing months and years.”</p>
    <p>QT Vas­cu­lar, up 112.5 per cent to 1.7 cents, was the most heav­ily traded stock of the day, with 527.3 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands. In­vestors re­acted to news of the com­pany’s re­verse takeover plans through the ac­qui­si­tion of Ten­gri Coal and En­ergy.</p>
    <p>Health­care stocks were among the big­gest de­clin­ers of the day. Glove mak­ers such as Top Glove shed 8.2 per cent to close at $8.38 and UG Health­care lost 10.2 per cent to $2.30. River­stone Hold­ings, too, ended the day 4.6 per cent down at $3.96. Med­i­cal ap­parel maker</p>
    <p>Medtecs In­ter­na­tional’s share price slid 15.5 per cent to $1.42.</p>
    <p>Among the con­stituent stocks, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines emerged the top gainer, adding 3.3 per cent to close at $3.80. The grad­ual re­open­ing of bor­ders fu­elled in­vestor sen­ti­ment, with some 13.2 mil­lion shares traded over the course of the day.</p>
    <p>Air­line gate­way ser­vices provider Sats saw its share price gain 0.65 per cent to $3.10 af­ter CGS-CIMB up­graded its call on the com­pany to “hold”. The bro­ker­age said the worst could be over for the group, and that it could look for­ward to bet­ter freight rates on the back of stronger de­mand for per­ish­able and med­i­cal sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Banks ended the day in pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory. DBS gained 1 per cent to $20.99, OCBC Bank added 1.5 per cent to $8.74, and United Over­seas Bank closed 1.1 per cent higher at $20.06.</p>
