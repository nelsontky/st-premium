    <p>United States Jus­tice Depart­ment of­fi­cials have crit­i­cised Bei­jing for tol­er­at­ing Chi­nese hack­ers and pro­vid­ing them with a safe haven in­stead of bring­ing them to jus­tice, as they un­sealed in­dict­ments against five Chi­nese cit­i­zens and t wo Malaysians in a wide-rang­ing hack­ing cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has the power to help stop crimes like these,” Deputy At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Jef­frey Rosen said at a me­dia con­fer­ence on Wed­nes­day. “The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has made a de­lib­er­ate choice to al­low its cit­i­zens to com­mit com­puter in­tru­sions and at­tacks around the world be­cause these ac­tors will also help the PRC (Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China).”</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said the five Chi­nese na­tion­als hacked 100 firms in the US and other coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore. Their tar­gets in­cluded soft­ware devel­op­ment com­pa­nies, so­cial me­dia firms, non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions, uni­ver­si­ties, think­tanks, and pro-democ­racy politi­cians and ac­tivists in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent elec­tronic com­mu­ni­ca­tions ser­vices and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions providers in the US, Sin­ga­pore and else­where were also com­pro­mised, they said. The vic­tim firms were not named in court doc­u­ments un­sealed on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The hack­ers, whom the pros­e­cu­tors said are cur­rently fugi­tives in China, also com­pro­mised gov­ern­ment com­puter net­works in In­dia and Viet­nam, and tar­geted but failed to breach gov­ern­ment com­puter net­works in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the al­le­ga­tions, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin said yes­ter­day at a reg­u­lar me­dia brief­ing in Bei­jing: “The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is a staunch de­fender of cy­ber se­cu­rity and has al­ways res­o­lutely op­posed and cracked down on all forms of cy­ber at­tacks and cy­ber­crimes in ac­cor­dance with the law.</p>
    <p>“Re­gret­tably, the US has l ong used cy­ber se­cu­rity is­sues as a tool for stig­ma­ti­sa­tion, po­lit­i­cal ma­nip­u­la­tion and spread­ing false­hoods and in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wang added: “We urge the</p>
    <p>United States to treat cy­ber se­cu­rity is­sues in an ob­jec­tive and ra­tio­nal man­ner, and jointly re­spond to the chal­lenges of hacker at­tacks through di­a­logue and co­op­er­a­tion on the ba­sis of mu­tual re­spect.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the two Malaysians were charged with con­spir­ing with two of the Chi­nese hack­ers to profit from hacks tar­get­ing the video game in­dus­try in the US and abroad by il­le­gally ob­tain­ing or gen­er­at­ing in-game re­sources and sell­ing them in the black mar­ket through their web­site. The pair were ar­rested in Perak on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“The scope and so­phis­ti­ca­tion of the crimes in these un­sealed in­dict­ments is un­prece­dented. The al­leged crim­i­nal scheme used ac­tors in China and Malaysia to il­le­gally hack, in­trude and steal in­for­ma­tion from vic­tims world­wide,” said Mr Michael Sher­win, the act­ing US at­tor­ney for the District of Columbia, where the charges were filed.</p>
    <p>While the Jus­tice Depart­ment did not say Bei­jing was be­hind the hack­ers, it noted that one of the Chi­nese de­fen­dants said he was “very close” to China’s Min­istry of State Se­cu­rity and would be pro­tected “un­less some­thing very big hap­pens”.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has brought sev­eral cases against Chi­nese hack­ers in re­cent months, ac­cus­ing Bei­jing of spon­sor­ing es­pi­onage and hack­ing at­tempts to steal US in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and un­der­mine its na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s lack of ac­tion in pre­vi­ous US hack­ing cases, Mr Rosen said Bei­jing showed a pat­tern of tol­er­at­ing crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity by hack­ers who were will­ing to work on be­half of the Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, the record of re­cent years tells us that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party has a demon­strated his­tory of... mak­ing China safe for their own cy­ber crim­i­nals, so long as they help with its goals of steal­ing in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and sti­fling free­dom,” said Mr Rosen.</p>
    <p>Some de­fen­dants felt they could hack with im­punity as long as they did not tar­get do­mes­tic Chi­nese com­pa­nies, pros­e­cu­tors noted.</p>
    <p>Mr Rosen said: “Some of these crim­i­nal ac­tors be­lieved their as­so­ci­a­tion with the PRC pro­vided them free li­cence to hack and steal across the globe.”</p>
    <p>The hack­ing cam­paign was the work of a group called Ad­vanced Per­sis­tent Threat (APT)-41, which car­ries out both es­pi­onage and for­profit hack­ing, said the Jus­tice Depart­ment. In a re­port, cy­ber se­cu­rity firm FireEye called APT-41 “a pro­lific cy­ber threat group” with two fo­cuses: Chi­nese state-spon­sored es­pi­onage, and cy­ber­crime ac­tiv­i­ties tar­get­ing the video game in­dus­try for per­sonal fi­nan­cial gain.</p>
    <p>The first in­dict­ment, handed down in Au­gust last year, charged Chi­nese na­tion­als Zhang Hao­ran, 35, and Tan Dailin, 35, with 25 counts of con­spir­acy, wire fraud, ag­gra­vated iden­tity theft, money laun­der­ing and other com­puter fraud.</p>
    <p>They would il­le­gally ac­cess video game com­pany com­puter net­works to fraud­u­lently gen­er­ate dig­i­tal items of value, in­clud­ing ingame cur­rency and other good­ies, and sell them for a profit. They would also take ac­tion against other un­re­lated groups that fraud­u­lently gen­er­ate gam­ing items as well, at­tempt­ing to elim­i­nate their com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>An­other in­dict­ment last month charged three more Chi­nese na­tion­als – Jiang Lizhi, 35, Qian Chuan, 39, and Fu Qiang, 37 – with nine counts of rack­e­teer­ing, fraud, iden­tity theft and money laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>They held top po­si­tions at Chengdu404, a Chi­nese firm head­quar­tered in China’s Sichuan prov­ince, where they would at­tack sup­ply chains, which in­volved gain­ing ac­cess to soft­ware firms and mod­i­fy­ing their soft­ware code to fur­ther hack cus­tomers of the soft­ware providers, said pros­e­cu­tors.</p>
    <p>All five were not known to have ever resided in the US, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The last in­dict­ment charged Malaysian busi­ness­men Wong Ong Hua, 46, and Ling Yang Ching, 32, with 23 counts of rack­e­teer­ing, con­spir­acy and other fraud.</p>
    <p>Wong was the founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sea Gamer Mall, a Malaysian firm sell­ing video game goods and ser­vices, in­clud­ing cur­rency and other dig­i­tal items, while Ling was its chief prod­uct of­fi­cer.</p>
