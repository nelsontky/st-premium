    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s health­care ad­vis­ers have held talks with drug com­pany ex­ec­u­tives on the gov­ern­ment’s Oper­a­tion Warp Speed pro­gramme to ac­cel­er­ate de­vel­op­ment of a pos­si­ble Covid-19 treat­ment, a Bi­den spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, Oper­a­tion Warp Speed struck deals with sev­eral drug­mak­ers in an ef­fort to help speed up the search for ef­fec­tive treat­ments for the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The US Covid-19 death toll stands at over 240,000, with more than 10 mil­lion cases now re­ported in the coun­try since the out­break be­gan.</p>
    <p>“As we pre­vi­ously said in Septem­ber, be­cause Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is ab­so­lutely com­mit­ted to help­ing de­velop a safe and ef­fec­tive coro­n­avirus vac­cine as soon as pos­si­ble, cam­paign med­i­cal ad­vis­ers have re­ceived brief­ings from com­pa­nies work­ing to pro­duce vac­cines in or­der to be in­formed about the process,” Mr Bi­den’s spokesman An­drew Bates said in an email state­ment on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s ad­vis­ers met of­fi­cials of com­pa­nies that had Covid-19 vac­cines or ther­a­pies in late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als in Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber, Bloomberg News had re­ported ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The re­port added that the meet­ings were aimed at gath­er­ing in­for­ma­tion about the de­vel­op­ment, man­u­fac­ture and dis­tri­bu­tion of shots to ward off the coro­n­avirus, as well as ther­a­pies to treat the sick.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has vowed to “lis­ten to the sci­ence”, with his coro­n­avirus plan call­ing for scal­ing up test­ing and con­tact trac­ing and promis­ing to ap­point a “sup­ply com­man­der” to over­see sup­ply lines of crit­i­cal equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Late last month, Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar said the United States is likely to have enough safe and ef­fec­tive Covid-19 vac­cines avail­able to in­oc­u­late the most vul­ner­a­ble Amer­i­cans by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>In their talks, Mr Bi­den’s ad­vis­ers in­di­cated to drug com­pany of­fi­cials that his ad­min­is­tra­tion would not be i nter­ested i n mak­ing changes to Warp Speed that would dis­rupt work in get­ting new vac­cines to mar­ket, Bloomberg said, adding that his ad­min­is­tra­tion would want to as­sist the com­pa­nies’ ef­forts when Mr Bi­den as­sumes of­fice.</p>
