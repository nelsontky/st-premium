    <p>LON­DON • Gareth South­gate ad­mit­ted he was im­pressed with Jack Gre­al­ish as the Eng­land winger sparkled and Harry Maguire en­joyed a mo­ment of re­demp­tion in Thurs­day’s 3-0 friendly win against the Repub­lic of Ire­land.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing sent off in his pre­vi­ous ap­pear­ance against Denmark, Maguire cap­tained his coun­try for the first time and scored the opener at Wem­b­ley.</p>
    <p>It was a wel­come boost for Maguire, who has en­dured a dif­fi­cult cam­paign marred by his Greek court case and poor form for Manch­ester United and Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Jadon San­cho bagged Eng­land’s sec­ond goal be­fore the in­ter­val and Do­minic Calvert-Lewin made it three with a sec­ond-half penalty.</p>
    <p>That was enough to seal Eng­land’s first suc­cess against their neigh­bours since 1985.</p>
    <p>Gre­al­ish, start­ing against the coun­try he rep­re­sented at youth level, caught the eye on the left flank as he jus­ti­fied the clam­our­ing from fans and pun­dits for the As­ton Villa star to be given a sus­tained run in the team.</p>
    <p>“The two play­ers in those roles, Jadon and Jack, they’ve got the free­dom to go ei­ther side of the pitch and try and create over­loads,” South­gate said.</p>
    <p>“I thought at times both of them did that re­ally well. Of course, as soon as they are turned and run­ning at peo­ple, they are a real prob­lem for the op­po­nent.”</p>
    <p>There was a land­mark mo­ment for Jude Belling­ham, who be­came the third youngest player to rep­re­sent Eng­land when the 17-year-old Borus­sia Dort­mund mid­fielder came on for Ma­son Mount in the 73rd minute.</p>
    <p>Belling­ham, who left Birm­ing­ham to join Dort­mund ear­lier this year and was only called up to the squad af­ter James Ward-Prowse was with­drawn through in­jury, is be­hind only Theo Wal­cott and Wayne Rooney in the list of Eng­land’s youngest play­ers.</p>
    <p>The teenager is one for the fu­ture, but South­gate will have been more en­cour­aged by the way his un­der­stud­ies im­pressed af­ter he rested Harry Kane, Ra­heem Ster­ling and Jor­dan Hen­der­son be­fore the Na­tions League games against Bel­gium to­mor­row and Ice­land on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“I was very pleased with the way the boys played,” South­gate said.</p>
    <p>“A lot of young play­ers, a lot of in­ex­pe­ri­enced play­ers, we used the ball very well, cre­ated a lot of chances, could have been more com­fort­able if we’d taken some of those chances but over­all very pleased.</p>
    <p>“We were a bit slow at the start but that’s un­der­stand­able. It’s not a team that have had a lot of time to work to­gether.</p>
    <p>“The longer they went on, some of the in­ter­play, some of the play be­tween our at­tack­ing 10s and our wing-backs in par­tic­u­lar, were very good.”</p>
