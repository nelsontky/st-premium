    <p>The sec­ond batch of $150 gro­cery vouch­ers to help less welloff Sin­ga­pore­ans liv­ing in one­and two-room Hous­ing Board flats will be given out over the next four Satur­days, start­ing Dec 12, this time di­rectly to the homes of re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter about 229 sets of the pre­vi­ous batch of vouch­ers were stolen from let­ter­boxes, some dam­aged or un­locked. The Min­istry of Finance said the changed de­liv­ery method should “bet­ter bal­ance safety, se­cu­rity and con­ve­nience to re­cip­i­ents”.</p>
    <p>For those not at home af­ter SingPost agents try to de­liver it twice, re­cip­i­ents will be no­ti­fied to col­lect their vouch­ers at a spec­i­fied post of­fice within 10 work­ing days.</p>
    <p>The gro­cery vouch­ers were an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat ear­lier in the year dur­ing the Bud­get.</p>
    <p>About 150,000 el­i­gi­ble re­cip­i­ents – Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 21 years and above liv­ing in one­and two-room flats, and who do not own more than one prop­erty – will get $300 this year and a fur­ther $100 in Oc­to­ber next year.</p>
    <p>The first $150 was al­ready given out in an ex­er­cise in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said some re­cip­i­ents have shared how the vouch­ers made a dif­fer­ence to them, and he hoped this sec­ond set of vouch­ers will sim­i­larly help house­holds de­fray their ex­penses.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing this chal­leng­ing pe­riod, we know that house­hold ex­penses may be weigh­ing on the minds of less well-off fam­i­lies among us,” said Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Finance.</p>
    <p>“We had ear­lier dis­bursed the first tranche of the gro­cery vouch­ers in Oc­to­ber which helped to de­fray the re­cip­i­ents’ house­hold ex­penses. I hope that the sec­ond round of vouch­ers will pro­vide ad­di­tional as­sis­tance.”</p>
    <p>As at Oct 28, 55 peo­ple have been ar­rested for steal­ing the gro­cery vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Finance In­dra­nee Ra­jah said in Par­lia­ment that dig­i­tal vouch­ers had been ruled out as re­cip­i­ents may not own a smart­phone, have a mo­bile data plan or the dig­i­tal knowhow nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>About 150,000 el­i­gi­ble re­cip­i­ents – Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 21 years and above liv­ing in one- and two-room flats, and who do not own more than one prop­erty – will get $300 this year and a fur­ther $100 in Oc­to­ber next year.</p>
