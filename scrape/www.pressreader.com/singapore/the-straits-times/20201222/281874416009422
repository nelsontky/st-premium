    <p>An ad­vi­sory panel on Sun­day rec­om­mended that United States front-line es­sen­tial work­ers and peo­ple 75 and older should be next in line to get in­oc­u­lated as the dis­tri­bu­tion of Moderna’s vac­cine, the sec­ond ap­proved coro­n­avirus vac­cine, be­gan across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion’s Ad­vi­sory</p>
    <p>Com­mit­tee on Im­mu­ni­sa­tion Prac­tices voted 13 to 1 to rec­om­mend that 30 mil­lion front-line es­sen­tial work­ers, which in­clude first re­spon­ders, teach­ers, food and agri­cul­ture, man­u­fac­tur­ing, the US Postal Ser­vice, pub­lic tran­sit and gro­cery store em­ploy­ees, have the next pri­or­ity for the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>In all, the move would make 51 mil­lion peo­ple el­i­gi­ble to get in­oc­u­lated in the next round.</p>
    <p>It was not im­me­di­ately clear when the next round would be­gin.</p>
    <p>About 200 mil­lion peo­ple, in­clud­ing non-front-line work­ers, such as those in the me­dia, fi­nance, en­ergy and IT and com­mu­ni­ca­tion in­dus­tries, per­sons in the 65 to 74 age group, and those aged 16 to 64</p>
    <p>with high-risk con­di­tions should be in the en­su­ing round, the panel rec­om­mended.</p>
    <p>States, which are the ones dis­tribut­ing shots to their res­i­dents, will use the ad­vi­sory panel’s guide­lines to de­cide on how to al­lo­cate the vac­cines while sup­plies are scarce.</p>
    <p>In­oc­u­la­tion against the dis­ease is key to safely re­open­ing large parts of the econ­omy and re­duc­ing the risks of ill­ness at crowded meat­pack­ing plants, fac­to­ries and ware­houses.</p>
    <p>How­ever, con­fu­sion has bro­ken out over who ex­actly is con­sid­ered es­sen­tial dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the vote, many firms and in­dus­try groups had been lob­by­ing to get their US work­ers in line to re­ceive the vac­cines im­me­di­ately af­ter health­care pro­fes­sion­als and long-term care fa­cil­ity res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, FedEx and United Par­cel Ser­vice (UPS) trucks started pick­ing up the doses from ware­houses for de­liv­ery to hos­pi­tals and other sites.</p>
    <p>Vials of Moderna’s vac­cine were filled in phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ser­vices provider Catal­ent’s fa­cil­ity in Bloom­ing­ton, In­di­ana.</p>
    <p>Dis­trib­u­tor McKes­son is ship­ping doses from fa­cil­i­ties in places in­clud­ing Louisville, Ken­tucky, and Mem­phis, Ten­nessee – close to air hubs for UPS and FedEx.</p>
    <p>Both FedEx and UPS said the</p>
    <p>ship­ments were run­ning smoothly and every­thing was go­ing ex­actly as planned.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, US health of­fi­cials are mon­i­tor­ing the new strain of Covid-19 emerg­ing in Bri­tain, US sur­geon-gen­eral Jerome Adams said on Sun­day, adding that any mu­ta­tion shows peo­ple must keep pro­tect­ing them­selves from the coro­n­avirus while await­ing vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The vari­ant, which of­fi­cials say is up to 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble than the orig­i­nal, has prompted con­cerns about a wider spread.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries, in­clud­ing Bel­gium, Italy and the Nether­lands, said they were tak­ing mea­sures to pre­vent peo­ple ar­riv­ing from Bri­tain, in­clud­ing bans on flights and trains.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion of Moderna’s vac­cine to more than 3,700 lo­ca­tions in the US will vastly widen the roll-out started last week by Pfizer and Ger­man part­ner BioNTech.</p>
    <p>US Covid-19 vac­cine pro­gramme head Mon­cef Slaoui said it was most likely that the first Moderna vac­cine shot, which was ap­proved by the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion last Fri­day, would be given yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“We look for­ward to the vac­cine. It’s go­ing to be slightly eas­ier to dis­trib­ute be­cause it doesn’t re­quire as low (a) tem­per­a­ture as Pfizer’s,” Dr Slaoui said on CNN.</p>
