    <p>Who wants to be a Chi­nese bil­lion­aire? Plenty do but there is a price to be paid, as un­der­scored by the re­cent fall from grace of re­tired prop­erty ty­coon Ren Zhiqiang, says China bureau chief Tan Dawn Wei (below).</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • Last month, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party kicked out an out­spo­ken critic and be­gan look­ing into prose­cut­ing him.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing un­usual in that, given the reg­u­lar culling of trou­ble­some party mem­bers, ex­cept the ex­pelled party mem­ber was well-known re­tired prop­erty ty­coon Ren Zhiqiang.</p>
    <p>Nick­named “Big Can­non Ren” for his blis­ter­ing commentari­es on the Chi­nese lead­er­ship, Mr Ren, 69, went miss­ing in March af­ter a par­tic­u­larly scathing es­say at­tack­ing the govern­ment for cov­er­ing up the ex­tent of the coro­n­avirus out­break in Wuhan. What stood out for many ob­servers was his lac­er­at­ing com­ments that were clearly aimed at Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping even though no names were men­tioned.</p>
    <p>“I see not an em­peror stand­ing there dis­play­ing his ‘new clothes’, but a clown who stripped naked and in­sisted on con­tin­u­ing to be an em­peror,” he wrote. “You don’t in the slight­est hide your res­o­lute am­bi­tion to be an em­peror and your de­ter­mi­na­tion to de­stroy any­one who won’t let you.”</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nist Party has since ac­cused Mr Ren of vi­o­lat­ing the Four Car­di­nal Prin­ci­ples, one of which is the prin­ci­ple of up­hold­ing the lead­er­ship of the party.</p>
    <p>Other charges were lobbed against Mr Ren, who is likely to face trial for em­bez­zle­ment, cor­rup­tion and col­lud­ing with his chil­dren “to ac­cu­mu­late wealth by un­fair means”.</p>
    <p>The high-pro­file ex­pul­sion comes amid a tight­en­ing of screws on dis­sent di­rected at aca­demics, of­fi­cials and vo­cal en­trepreneur­s, and sends a chill­ing sig­nal on the party’s zero tol­er­ance for any rig­or­ous de­bate or crit­i­cism, es­pe­cially to­wards the Chi­nese lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>That Mr Ren is a long-time party mem­ber – he joined at the age of 23 – and a princeling ul­ti­mately mat­tered lit­tle un­der Pres­i­dent Xi’s regime when, in the past, such “red busi­ness­men” would be han­dled with care.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren’s fa­ther was China’s Vice-Min­is­ter of Com­merce, and his mother was a Bei­jing mu­nic­i­pal of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>“That’s why he dared to speak up, be­cause of his fam­ily con­nec­tions. If it was any other reg­u­lar Chi­nese per­son, he would’ve been fixed a long time ago,” said a Bei­jing-based po­lit­i­cal ob­server who de­clined to be named for fear of get­ting into trou­ble.</p>
    <p>With ty­coons tak­ing on high pro­files in re­cent years and their em­pires ex­pand­ing be­yond the Chi­nese bor­der, the Com­mu­nist Party un­der Pres­i­dent Xi has sought to rein them in.</p>
    <p>When China’s rich­est man, Alibaba founder Jack Ma, stepped down as chair­man of his com­pany last Septem­ber, talk was rife that it was be­cause he had grown too in­flu­en­tial and at­tracted too much at­ten­tion, and that did not sit well with the Chi­nese lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The self-made bil­lion­aire with a pen­chant for show­man­ship was do­ing in­ter­views in English on the in­ter­na­tional cir­cuit, dis­pens­ing ad­vice on how to make it big.</p>
    <p>And then, there was the 20-minute martial arts movie star­ring Mr Ma, his love for im­per­son­at­ing Michael Jack­son, and his rou­tine of of­fi­ci­at­ing at mass wed­dings of his em­ploy­ees on the Alibaba campus.</p>
    <p>“Pri­vate en­trepreneur­s can also be­come opin­ion lead­ers. And that’s not what the Chi­nese lead­er­ship wants,” said a busi­ness­man in Bei­jing who asked not to be named.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren, the prop­erty mogul, is one such per­son.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the au­thor­i­ties shut down his mi­croblog Weibo ac­count af­ter he blasted the party for us­ing the state-run me­dia to serve its pro­pa­ganda aims. He had 37 mil­lion fol­low­ers on his so­cial me­dia ac­count then.</p>
    <p>Bil­lion­aire in­vestor and celebrity blog­ger Charles Xue, whose fa­ther was vice-min­is­ter of the United Front Work De­part­ment re­spon­si­ble for launch­ing in­flu­ence op­er­a­tions in China and overseas, was ar­rested in 2013 for pre­sum­ably so­lic­it­ing a pros­ti­tute and made to con­fess on na­tional TV.</p>
    <p>The real rea­son for his ar­rest, as widely be­lieved, was his crit­i­cal so­cial me­dia posts on Chi­nese pol­i­tics that had a reach of</p>
    <p>12 mil­lion fol­low­ers. He was later re­leased and never charged.</p>
    <p>Yet another in­flu­en­tial ty­coon who crossed the line was bil­lion­aire Wang Gongquan, the co-founder of prop­erty gi­ant Van­tone.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang, a civil ac­tivist who had been ad­vo­cat­ing for more lib­eral poli­cies, was ar­rested in 2013 for sup­pos­edly “dis­turb­ing or­der in pub­lic space”. His Weibo ac­counts, which had over 1.5 mil­lion fol­low­ers, were deleted.</p>
    <p>UN­EASY RE­LA­TION­SHIP</p>
    <p>En­trepreneur­s con­stantly walk a tight rope in this coun­try.</p>
    <p>If China’s so­cial­ist mar­ket econ­omy is proudly one de­fined by Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics, so too is its re­la­tion­ship with its en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>Un­der tra­di­tional Com­mu­nist Party views, th­ese in­dus­tri­al­ists are sup­posed to be evil cap­i­tal­ist road­ers that Mao Ze­dong had sought to over­throw af­ter tak­ing power in 1949.</p>
    <p>When para­mount leader Deng Xiaop­ing em­barked on land­mark eco­nomic re­forms in 1978, en­trepreneur­ship was al­lowed to thrive once more, with shops and busi­nesses com­ing to life and spe­cial eco­nomic zones set up to en­cour­age cap­i­tal­ist ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>In 2001, then Pres­i­dent Jiang Zemin made a sig­nif­i­cant move to wel­come pri­vate busi­ness peo­ple into the Com­mu­nist Party fold; four years later, they be­came el­i­gi­ble for the party’s high­est com­men­da­tion – the “model and ad­vanced worker” award.</p>
    <p>In open­ing the party’s doors to en­trepreneur­s, the lead­er­ship hoped to co-opt th­ese dy­namic, often feisty cap­tains of in­dus­try po­lit­i­cally and har­ness their im­mense power to drive the coun­try’s eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>For busi­ness­men, a party mem­ber­ship could also help to grease the wheels in their busi­ness deal­ings, whether they be ac­cess to loans, land or a smoother jour­ney through the im­mense amount of red tape that the Chi­nese bu­reau­cracy is so in­fa­mous for.</p>
    <p>For some, po­lit­i­cal par­tic­i­pa­tion could also mean shap­ing poli­cies that may ben­e­fit them or the larger busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Tech ty­coons like Ten­cent’s Pony Ma and Baidu’s Robin Li show up at the coun­try’s most im­por­tant po­lit­i­cal event – the an­nual “Two Ses­sions” or Lianghui – each year.</p>
    <p>Mr Li has been a mem­ber of the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Po­lit­i­cal Con­sul­ta­tive Con­fer­ence, the top po­lit­i­cal ad­vi­sory body, for eight years now, rou­tinely of­fer­ing pol­icy sug­ges­tions at the yearly meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma is a Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress deputy, a law­maker in the na­tional leg­is­la­ture; and so is Xiaomi’s Lei Jun.</p>
    <p>STATE AD­VANCES,</p>
    <p>PRI­VATE SEC­TOR RE­TREATS</p>
    <p>In the past four decades since Mr Deng’s re­form-and-open­ing-up cam­paign, China’s pri­vate sec­tor has helped pro­pel the once im­pov­er­ished na­tion to be­come the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy to­day.</p>
    <p>China now has 573 bil­lion­aires in</p>
    <p>US dol­lar terms, ac­cord­ing to wealth tracker Hu­run Re­port, with Alibaba’s Mr Ma top­ping the list at $54 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate sec­tor drives in­no­va­tion and con­trib­utes more than 50 per cent of tax rev­enue to the state cof­fers. It also ac­counts for 60 per cent of the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and 80 per cent of ur­ban em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>But in re­cent years, the busi­ness com­mu­nity has found it­self in­creas­ingly squeezed, su­per­vised and scru­ti­nised as the state re­asserts its dom­i­nance and con­trol.</p>
    <p>Last year, the Hangzhou govern­ment an­nounced it was at­tach­ing 100 of­fi­cers to 100 of the city’s top com­pa­nies, such as Alibaba, Geely and Wa­haha, to help fos­ter a smoother busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The move un­nerved pri­vate en­ter­prises, which al­ready have to deal with the pres­ence of Com­mu­nist Party com­mit­tees within their or­gan­i­sa­tions, and po­lit­i­cal pres­sure for them to have a greater say over the run­ning of the com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate busi­ness own­ers have also long com­plained of the con­strain­ing space that they are al­lowed to op­er­ate in un­der this cur­rent regime, de­spite the lead­er­ship’s ex­hor­ta­tions that it would sup­port and pro­mote pri­vate en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>They have much less ac­cess to credit com­pared with state-backed en­ter­prises, while hav­ing to cough up high taxes.</p>
    <p>In his book pub­lished last year, The State Strikes Back: The End Of Eco­nomic Re­form In China?, econ­o­mist Ni­cholas Lardy out­lined how the Chi­nese pri­vate sec­tor has seen its role di­min­ish sig­nif­i­cantly over the past decade, while state-owned as­sets have grown five­fold.</p>
    <p>He ar­gues that China’s fu­ture growth would be rosy if it goes back to pri­ori­tis­ing mar­ket-ori­ented re­forms in­stead of con­tin­u­ing on this path of state dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>“The fun­da­men­tal ob­sta­cle to im­ple­ment­ing far-reach­ing eco­nomic re­forms in China is the top lead­er­ship’s view that while state-owned firms may be a drag on China’s eco­nomic growth, they are es­sen­tial to main­tain­ing the po­si­tion and con­trol of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party and achiev­ing the party’s strate­gic ob­jec­tives,” wrote Dr Lardy, a se­nior fel­low at the Peter­son In­sti­tute for In­ter­na­tional Eco­nomics.</p>
    <p>Amid the roil­ing US-China trade war last year, the state ramped up tak­ing stakes in pri­vate firms in record num­bers for fear of mas­sive un­em­ploy­ment aris­ing from the tit-for-tat ac­tions.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus out­break bring­ing many busi­nesses to their knees, en­trepreneur­s worry that the grip of the state will only strengthen.</p>
    <p>Any­one with doubts about whether Pres­i­dent Xi will re­verse his guo­jin min­tui (state ad­vances, pri­vate sec­tor re­treats) pol­icy in th­ese dif­fi­cult times and let the pri­vate sec­tor take the lead, need only read what he said last week in an ar­ti­cle in the Cen­tral Party School’s po­lit­i­cal the­ory jour­nal, Qiushi.</p>
    <p>China’s po­lit­i­cal econ­omy will adapt to chang­ing con­di­tions, but would still be rooted in Marx­ist val­ues, said Mr Xi, who has been call­ing for com­pa­nies to em­brace a new “in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion” eco­nomic model.</p>
    <p>“We must unswerv­ingly con­sol­i­date and de­velop the state-owned econ­omy, unswerv­ingly en­cour­age, sup­port and guide the devel­op­ment of the non-state-owned econ­omy, and pro­mote var­i­ous own­er­ship sys­tems to com­ple­ment each other’s strengths, pro­mote each other, and de­velop to­gether,” said the ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>“The dom­i­nant po­si­tion of pub­lic own­er­ship can­not be shaken, and the lead­ing role of the state-owned econ­omy can­not be shaken.”</p>
    <p>State-owned en­ter­prises will still be a pri­or­ity for the govern­ment, says the Bei­jing-based po­lit­i­cal ob­server. “They are the party’s as­sets, so they must be guarded at all costs. The pri­vate sec­tor is still just a sup­port­ing ac­tor.”</p>
    <p>Above all, Mr Xi de­mands loy­alty from the busi­ness com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Pa­tri­o­tism is the glo­ri­ous tra­di­tion of our coun­try’s out­stand­ing en­trepreneur­s in mod­ern times,” he told Chi­nese in­dus­tri­al­ists at a fo­rum on July 21.</p>
    <p>From the Com­mu­nist Party’s point of view, bil­lion­aires be­came bil­lion­aires in China be­cause of the govern­ment’s poli­cies.</p>
    <p>It is the party that has en­riched them. As busi­ness­men, the ex­pec­ta­tion is they should un­der­stand there is a price – fealty to their bene­fac­tors.</p>
