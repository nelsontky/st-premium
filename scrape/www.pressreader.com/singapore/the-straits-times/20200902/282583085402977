    <p>AH BOY TO MAN – MAXI LIM IS NOW A DAD:</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ac­tor Maxi Lim has be­gun his “reign” as a father.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old, who mar­ried in­flu­encer Lizy Teo in late March, an­nounced the birth of their son (above) last Satur­day via an In­sta­gram ac­count the cou­ple (top) have set up for their child.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “Hi ev­ery­one! I came out at 2.7kg ear­lier to­day. Drank some milk and slept. Pretty event­ful I would say.</p>
    <p>“Oh I think I can do pouty face and wink oc­ca­sion­ally too. Would you wanna see?”</p>
    <p>Lim, who is known for his role as “Wayang King” Aloy­sius Jin in di­rec­tor Jack Neo’s Ah Boys To Men mil­i­tary-themed movies (2012 to 2017), posted a photo of Teo and the baby with a bal­loon which says: “Wel­come to Earth, Baby Reign”.</p>
    <p>He was con­grat­u­lated by ac­tor Noah Yap, one of his co-stars.</p>
    <p>Yap, who played the role of IP Man in the Ah Boys To Men movies, posted a photo of him­self with Lim and the baby and wrote: “Reign Lim, re­mem­ber my face. I’ll al­ways be known to u as the fun un­cle. I nearly cried when I saw you as if you were my own kid... con­grats.”</p>
    <p>Lim pro­posed to Teo in Fe­bru­ary, but the cou­ple had to post­pone their March wed­ding due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They reg­is­tered their mar­riage in a low-key cer­e­mony on</p>
    <p>March 29, which was at­tended by his co-stars.</p>
    <p>Lim an­nounced in April that his wife was preg­nant and dis­closed in May that they were ex­pect­ing a son.</p>
