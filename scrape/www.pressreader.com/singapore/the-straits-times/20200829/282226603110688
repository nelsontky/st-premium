    <p>You might find some bugs skim­ming the sur­face of a pond or even cre­at­ing their own scuba bub­ble to dive be­neath the sur­face of in­land lakes.</p>
    <p>But in­sects are vir­tu­ally ab­sent from the open ocean.</p>
    <p>If you look at the hind flippers of south­ern ele­phant seals, how­ever, you will find some in­sects that have made their way to a par­tially aquatic life.</p>
    <p>Lice of the species Lepi­doph­thirus macrorhini dwell on the rear limbs of the l arge aquatic mam­mals, which spend nearly 10 months of the year in antarc­tic wa­ters and dive up to 1,980m be­low the sur­face in search of food and may stay un­der for nearly two hours at a time.</p>
    <p>Th­ese lice could be the deep­est sur­viv­ing in­sects in marine ecosys­tems, ac­cord­ing to a study pub­lished last month in the Jour­nal of Ex­per­i­men­tal Bi­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>By en­dur­ing such ex­treme en­vi­ron­ments, ele­phant seal lice can help sci­en­tists un­ravel the mys­tery of why so few in­sects have made a home in the ocean’s vast­ness.</p>
    <p>They are par­a­sitic, blood­suck­ing lice that bur­row into the seal’s top skin layer to feed.</p>
    <p>In 2015, marine bi­ol­o­gist Maria Soledad Leonardi found live lice on male ele­phant seals that sur­faced to breed on King Ge­orge Is­land off the coast of Antarc­tica.</p>
    <p>“You can see them with your naked eye,” she said. “They look like minia­ture crabs.”</p>
    <p>To her, the pres­ence of lice on adult seals emerg­ing from lengthy offshore ex­cur­sions sug­gested that the in­sects could sur­vive the deep dives and steep climbs of the seals’ aquatic jour­neys.</p>
    <p>And that meant the lice might be able to en­dure the crush­ing pres­sure of the ocean’s depths.</p>
    <p>Us­ing tweez­ers, her team pulled the in­sects from the hind flippers of 15 ele­phant seal pups born on the beaches of Penin­sula Valdes in Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>The pups har­bour adult lice that are trans­ferred from their moth­ers’ bod­ies within a few days of birth.</p>
    <p>The lice quickly re­pro­duce, tak­ing ad­van­tage of the ini­tial weeks that the pups are con­fined to land, as their eggs do not hatch un­der­wa­ter.</p>
    <p>In the lab­o­ra­tory, the team im­mersed the lice in in­di­vid­ual flash­drive-size cham­bers filled with sea­wa­ter that con­nected to a scuba tank.</p>
    <p>Then, they ex­posed each louse to a range of wa­ter pres­sures, as much as 200 times greater than that at the sea sur­face and equiv­a­lent to depths rang­ing be­tween 300m and 1,980m. Af­ter ex­pe­ri­enc­ing 10 min­utes of this deep-sea en­vi­ron­ment, 69 of 75 lice emerged alive.</p>
    <p>“It was fas­ci­nat­ing for me to see that they sur­vived the high pres­sure,” said in­sect phys­i­ol­o­gist Clau­dio Laz­zari of the Uni­ver­sity of Tours in France and a co-au­thor of the study.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers then ex­posed sur­viv­ing lice to a wa­ter pres­sure higher or lower than what they were sub­ject to ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“The idea was to re­pro­duce the sit­u­a­tion that lice would ex­pe­ri­ence when their host dives through dif­fer­ent pres­sure lev­els,” Pro­fes­sor Laz­zari said.</p>
    <p>All of the lice were able to tol­er­ate the quick pres­sure change, with adults re­cov­er­ing faster and ex­hibit­ing mo­bil­ity af­ter the ex­per­i­ment, as com­pared with the nymphs.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Stu­art Humphries, an evo­lu­tion­ary bio­physi­cist at the Uni­ver­sity of Lin­coln in Eng­land, said “it’d be in­ter­est­ing to know how the lice do it”.</p>
    <p>So far, the re­searchers do not know if seal lice have spe­cial adap­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“My guess is that th­ese guys just shut down and lock their tra­cheal sys­tem,” Prof Humphries said, mean­ing that the lice could hold their breath in deep wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers are now look­ing to con­duct ex­per­i­ments to see if th­ese in­sects ar­rest their ac­tiv­ity and en­ergy ex­pen­di­ture in the deep sea or if they con­tinue breath­ing.</p>
    <p>“Un­der­stand­ing how this group of in­sects man­ages to sur­vive un­der­wa­ter will be the key to un­der­stand­ing why other groups couldn’t,” Prof Laz­zari said.</p>
