    <p>I am trou­bled by news of the 29-year-old maid who de­liv­ered her own baby, was ar­rested and has now been jailed (Woman jailed for leav­ing in­fant in re­cy­cling bin, Nov 6). There are two mat­ters of con­cern:</p>
    <p>• Men­tal and hor­monal is­sues faced by preg­nant women dur­ing preg­nancy and af­ter they have de­liv­ered</p>
    <p>• Pro­tec­tion of vul­ner­a­ble mi­grant work­ers</p>
    <p>Moth­ers need sup­port from fam­ily and friends, even in the most nor­mal of cir­cum­stances. Ma­ter­nal well­ness has re­ceived more at­ten­tion, par­tic­u­larly for women suf­fer­ing from mood and anx­i­ety dis­or­ders dur­ing preg­nancy and up to a year af­ter giv­ing birth.</p>
    <p>What help and sup­port did this woman re­ceive?</p>
    <p>On the sec­ond point, did the trial and sen­tenc­ing take prece­dence over a psy­chi­atric as­sess­ment? Is there a sys­tem in place with a holis­tic ap­proach to­wards the wel­fare of mi­grant work­ers? Specif­i­cally, has this case fallen through the cracks, be­fore and af­ter her ar­rest?</p>
    <p>The baby sur­vived and we are thank­ful. But where was the fa­ther of the child? The woman seems to have gone through the trauma alone. We may never know the full ex­tent of her fear, an­guish and pain, both phys­i­cal and men­tal. Ngauw Huey Yann</p>
