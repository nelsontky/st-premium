    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are look­ing into bet­ter sup­port­ing the men­tal and phys­i­cal health needs of mi­grant work­ers here in the long run, said the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes as­sess­ing whether work­ers will be al­lowed to leave their dor­mi­to­ries on their rest days, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong who co-chairs the task force.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries have spent the last few months con­fined to their quar­ters.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) has said it is aware of the re­cent sui­cides and at­tempted sui­cides in­volv­ing mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dorms.</p>
    <p>The task force is con­cerned about the work­ers’ sit­u­a­tion, said the Health Min­istry’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“They’ve not been al­lowed to come out of the dor­mi­to­ries into the com­mu­nity freely. And that pro­longed pe­riod of iso­la­tion will ob­vi­ously have po­ten­tial ad­verse ef­fects on any in­di­vid­ual, not just mi­grant work­ers, but any­one who, in fact, has to be cooped up in iso­la­tion with very limited op­por­tu­ni­ties for so­cial in­ter­ac­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak added that the in­ter-agency task force, to­gether with MOM and pri­vate stake­hold­ers, has been work­ing to sup­port the wel­fare of these work­ers in var­i­ous ways, such as help­ing them cel­e­brate hol­i­days and pro­vid­ing av­enues for help and coun­selling.</p>
    <p>He added that a work group is look­ing at the men­tal health is­sues faced by the work­ers to see how to bet­ter sup­port them.</p>
    <p>“This con­tin­ues to be a work in progress so I do not pre­tend that the work is com­pleted (or) that we have a very com­pre­hen­sive sys­tem of sup­port,” he said.</p>
    <p>But the task force is com­mit­ted to mak­ing sure there is a “sus­tain­able frame­work” to sup­port the men­tal health of mi­grant work­ers, even af­ter the out­break ends, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said mea­sures will also be taken to en­sure work­ers’ phys­i­cal health, in­clud­ing rou­tine test­ing ev­ery 14 days.</p>
    <p>If a case is de­tected, the aim is to quickly iso­late the work­ers in the same room or on the same floor, in or­der to avoid hav­ing to lock down the en­tire block or dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to this, Prof Mak said, many mea­sures such as telemedici­ne and tele­mon­i­tor­ing us­ing telekiosks and var­i­ous other mon­i­tor­ing de­vices that were de­ployed in the dorms are likely to con­tinue.</p>
    <p>The task force is also look­ing to es­tab­lish more long-term med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties, such as med­i­cal cen­tres within or near dorms to pro­vide care for both acute and chronic con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Asked whether the task force would con­sider loos­en­ing some of the re­stric­tions on mi­grant work­ers, Mr Wong said the sit­u­a­tion is be­ing mon­i­tored “very care­fully”.</p>
    <p>He noted that work­ers who are cur­rently con­fined to their dorms are al­ready given the op­por­tu­nity to leave their rooms.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he added that given the high vi­ral load in the dorms, resid­ual cases can linger for weeks.</p>
    <p>So there is a need to con­duct reg­u­lar tests on the work­ers for a while more, in or­der to en­sure that all of them are free from the virus.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said: “At some point... as we have as­sur­ance that the test­ing process is done and the work­ers are free from the virus, we will also look at ex­pand­ing the pro­vi­sion for them to go out, be it to recre­ational cen­tres or to the com­mu­nity at large on their rest days.”</p>
