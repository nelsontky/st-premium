    <p>In­dia and the United States have signed a de­fence pact giv­ing the South Asian coun­try ac­cess to re­al­time data and topo­graph­i­cal im­ages from US mil­i­tary satel­lites.</p>
    <p>The new pact re­flects the grow­ing con­ver­gence of in­ter­ests be­tween New Delhi and Wash­ing­ton, par­tic­u­larly as both show grow­ing con­cern over China, which is cur­rently em­broiled in a bor­der row with In­dia.</p>
    <p>The Ba­sic Ex­change and Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment (Beca) was signed dur­ing the visit of US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo and De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper, who are in In­dia for a high-level se­cu­rity di­a­logue. The two US of­fi­cials held talks yes­ter­day with their In­dian coun­ter­parts, Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­is­ter S. Jais­hankar and De­fence Min­is­ter Ra­j­nath Singh, on greater mil­i­tary co­op­er­a­tion, the se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion in the Indo-Pa­cific, the pan­demic and greater de­fence co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>While In­dian lead­ers did not di­rectly men­tion China, Mr Pom­peo pledged sup­port for New Delhi in the bor­der stand-off, which fol­lowed a vi­o­lent clash in the Gal­wan Val­ley in Ladakh that left 20 In­dian soldiers and an un­known num­ber of Chi­nese troops dead. It was the worst such in­ci­dent in­volv­ing troops from the two sides in over four decades. In­dia and China are cur­rently hold­ing mil­i­tary and diplo­matic talks to re­solve the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo said the two sides had talks on the Covid-19 pan­demic, which led to “ro­bust dis­cus­sions” on the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP). He said: “The US will stand with the peo­ple of In­dia as they con­front threats to their sovereignt­y and to their lib­er­ties... Our lead­ers and our cit­i­zens see with in­creas­ing clar­ity that the CCP is no friend to democ­racy, the rule of law, trans­parency, the free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion... the foun­da­tion of a free and pros­per­ous Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>“The US and In­dia are tak­ing steps to strengthen our co­op­er­a­tion against all man­ners of threat and not just those posed by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party,” the US Sec­re­tary of State added at a press con­fer­ence af­ter the talks.</p>
    <p>Mr Esper echoed the sen­ti­ment, de­scrib­ing ties with In­dia as “re­silient and grow­ing”.</p>
    <p>“As the world con­fronts a global pan­demic and grow­ing se­cu­rity chal­lenges, the US-In­dia part­ner­ship is more im­por­tant than ever to en­sure se­cu­rity, sta­bil­ity and pros­per­ity of the re­gion and the world.</p>
    <p>“We stand shoul­der to shoul­der in sup­port of a free and open In­doPa­cific for all, par­tic­u­larly in light of in­creas­ing ag­gres­sion and desta­bil­is­ing ac­tiv­i­ties by China,” he said.</p>
    <p>The US De­fence Sec­re­tary also noted that In­dia’s re­cent de­ci­sion to in­clude Aus­tralia in the Mal­abar naval ex­er­cises, in­volv­ing In­dia, Ja­pan and the US, “re­flects an ac­knowl­edge­ment of the im­por­tance of work­ing mul­ti­lat­er­ally to ad­dress global chal­lenges”.</p>
    <p>All four coun­tries be­long to the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue, which is also known as the Quad, an in­for­mal se­cu­rity fo­rum seen by China as a way to con­tain its growth.</p>
    <p>De­fence co­op­er­a­tion be­tween In­dia and the US has deep­ened in re­cent years as Wash­ing­ton sharp­ened its fo­cus on the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, on the back of con­cerns about Chi­nese moves in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s lead­ers, while not re­fer­ring di­rectly to China, have pushed for a mul­ti­po­lar Asia and greater co­op­er­a­tion with the US.</p>
    <p>“Our na­tional se­cu­rity con­ver­gences have ob­vi­ously grown in a more mul­ti­po­lar world... A mul­ti­po­lar world must have a mul­ti­po­lar Asia as its ba­sis,” said Mr Jais­hankar.</p>
    <p>“We are also com­mit­ted to cre­at­ing more trusted and re­silient global sup­ply chains. An In­dia that is now fo­cused on re­cov­ery, re­silience and re­form wel­comes an ex­panded part­ner­ship with the United States,” he added.</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter Singh noted that “up­hold­ing the ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity and sovereignt­y of all states (is) es­sen­tial”.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say Beca will help In­dia im­prove its de­fence pre­pared­ness and shows that the China fac­tor re­mains a key driv­ing force in ex­pand­ing ties be­tween the US and In­dia.</p>
    <p>“In­dia (through the di­a­logue amid the pan­demic) wants to send mes­sag­ing to part­ners and ad­ver­saries on where we place the US in the scheme of things. We are con­verg­ing on Covid and China, which is ce­ment­ing ties be­tween the two coun­tries,” said Dr Ra­jeswari Pil­lai Ra­jagopalan, a dis­tin­guished fel­low at the New Delhi-based Ob­server Re­search Foun­da­tion.</p>
