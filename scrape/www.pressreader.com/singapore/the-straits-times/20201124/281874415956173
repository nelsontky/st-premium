    <p>JERUSALEM • Saudi Ara­bia has de­nied Is­raeli me­dia re­ports of land­mark talks be­tween Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu and its Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Sal­man dur­ing a visit by United States Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo.</p>
    <p>“I have seen press re­ports about a pur­ported meet­ing be­tween HRH the Crown Prince and Is­raeli officials dur­ing the re­cent visit by @SecPom­peo,” the Saudi For­eign Min­is­ter, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>“No such meet­ing oc­curred. The only officials present were Amer­i­can and Saudi.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Is­rael’s Army Ra­dio and Kan Ra­dio both re­ported that Mr Ne­tanyahu had se­cretly flown on Sun­day to the Saudi Red Sea town of Neom for talks with Crown Prince Mo­hammed and Mr Pom­peo amid a diplo­matic flurry prompted by re­gional fears of Iran.</p>
    <p>Ul­tra-con­ser­va­tive Saudi Ara­bia, the birth­place of Is­lam, has tra­di­tion­ally cham­pi­oned the Pales­tinian cause and shunned all of­fi­cial con­tacts with Is­rael. But the king­dom, its Gulf al­lies and Is­rael have a shared deep dis­trust of Iran.</p>
    <p>News of the meet­ing came a day af­ter Mr Ne­tanyahu, in an ap­par­ent mes­sage to US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, said in a speech that there should be no re­turn to the 2015 Iran nu­clear deal aban­doned by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Yoav Galant, a mem­ber of Mr Ne­tanyahu’s se­cu­rity Cabi­net, yes­ter­day de­scribed the Saudi meet­ing as an “amaz­ing achieve­ment”.</p>
    <p>“The very fact the meet­ing hap­pened, and was outed pub­licly, even if half-of­fi­cially right now, is a mat­ter of great im­por­tance,” he told Army Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>As Mr Trump’s term winds down, Mr Pom­peo has been try­ing to coax Saudi Ara­bia, the Gulf pow­er­house, to fol­low its neigh­bours, the United Arab Emi­rates and Bahrain, in es­tab­lish­ing for­mal diplo­matic re­la­tions with Is­rael.</p>
    <p>As well as want­ing to con­tain Iran, Mr Trump and Mr Pom­peo are also con­cerned about a pos­si­ble re­view of US poli­cies in the re­gion by the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who takes of­fice on Jan 20, has said he would re­join the nu­clear ac­cord that world pow­ers signed with Iran if it first re­sumed strict com­pli­ance with the deal, and would work with al­lies to strengthen the terms.</p>
    <p>The Is­raeli me­dia re­ports said Mr Ne­tanyahu was joined on the trip by spy agency Mos­sad’s di­rec­tor Yossi Co­hen, who has spear­headed dis­creet diplo­matic out­reach to Gulf Arab states.</p>
    <p>Riyadh has so far de­clined to nor­malise ties with Is­rael. But since Au­gust, it has al­lowed Is­raeli air­lin­ers to over­fly Saudi ter­ri­tory to newly avail­able Gulf des­ti­na­tions and Asia.</p>
