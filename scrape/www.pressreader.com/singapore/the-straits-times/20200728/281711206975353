    <p>The re­cent com­mu­nity clus­ter at the Bukit Pan­jang in­te­grated trans­port hub is a cause for con­cern, although its emer­gence did not sur­prise ex­perts.</p>
    <p>With the eas­ing of re­stric­tions and more peo­ple go­ing about in pub­lic, the for­ma­tion of such clus­ters is to be ex­pected, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Still, there is rea­son to worry be­cause the clus­ter – in­volv­ing four SMRT bus cap­tains who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 be­tween July 7 and last Friday – posed a rel­a­tively higher in­fec­tion risk to fel­low bus driv­ers than to com­muters, said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is these driv­ers, who are front-line work­ers, would likely have had sus­tained in­ter­ac­tions with the in­fected cases dur­ing break or meal times when they may not have been wear­ing masks, he said.</p>
    <p>But for com­muters, the risk is likely to be low as most would prob­a­bly have had only tran­sient in­ter­ac­tion with the driv­ers and been masked up, he added.</p>
    <p>The in­fected bus driv­ers drove ser­vices 976, 184 and 176, and three of them con­tracted the virus at home.</p>
    <p>Since the clus­ter was con­firmed last Friday, SMRT said on Sun­day that it has taken steps to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Its chief com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cer Mar­garet Teo said em­ploy­ees have been urged not to talk dur­ing meal­times when they are sit­ting close to one an­other, and to con­tinue mon­i­tor­ing their health dili­gently.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ees who were in close con­tact with the (in­fected driv­ers) have been placed on leave of ab­sence,” she added.</p>
    <p>All premises, such as de­pots and in­ter­changes, are cleaned and dis­in­fected fre­quently. Buses are also dis­in­fected at least twice daily.</p>
    <p>SMRT has ad­vised its bus driv­ers to strictly fol­low safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Ad­di­tional mea­sures to sani­tise t he af­fected premises have been im­ple­mented too,” said Ms Teo. These in­clude clos­ing the two can­teens as well as the crew rest rooms, toi­lets and pas­sen­ger ser­vice of­fice.</p>
    <p>“All com­mon premises have un­der­gone deep clean­ing and dis­in­fect­ing by an ex­ter­nal ven­dor,” she added.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said that while a clus­ter is bad news, what is more im­por­tant is the speed at which the au­thor­i­ties can ring-fence these com­mu­nity in­fec­tions, and how well con­tact trac­ing is done to iden­tify and iso­late those ex­posed as quickly as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at NUS’ Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said that it is bet­ter to have four linked cases than four that are un­linked.</p>
    <p>Con­tact trac­ing will be eas­ier with linked cases, he added. “There­fore, I am not es­pe­cially wor­ried by this par­tic­u­lar clus­ter.”</p>
    <p>With the virus set to stay for the long term, Sin­ga­pore­ans will need to learn to live with it, said Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“This re­quires com­mu­nity be­hav­iour to stay in line with all the guide­lines and rules,” he said.</p>
