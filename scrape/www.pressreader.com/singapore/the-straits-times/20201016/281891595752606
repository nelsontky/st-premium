    <p>While the ad­vance es­ti­mates for the third-quar­ter GDP re­leased on Wed­nes­day in­di­cate that the econ­omy has bot­tomed out, they also high­light how un­even the re­cov­ery is turn­ing out. This has im­por­tant im­pli­ca­tions for pol­icy. The 7 per cent year-on-year de­cline in GDP in Q3 was less se­vere than the 13.3 per cent con­trac­tion in the pre­ced­ing quar­ter. On a sea­son­ally ad­justed quar­ter-on­quar­ter ba­sis, Q3 growth was up a ro­bust 7.9 per cent, al­though from a low base.</p>
    <p>But these ag­gre­gate numbers mask wide dif­fer­ences in per­for­mance be­tween sec­tors and even within sec­tors. Man­u­fac­tur­ing was the only sec­tor that ex­panded on a year-on-year ba­sis, by 2 per cent. In sharp con­trast, the con­struc­tion sec­tor con­tracted by 44.7 per cent and the ser­vice sec­tor by 8 per cent. But within ser­vices, there were wide vari­a­tions. While fi­nance, in­sur­ance and IT ser­vices held up well, and re­tail and food ser­vices re­cov­ered slightly, avi­a­tion, hospitalit­y and en­ter­tain­ment con­tin­ued to suf­fer. Among these, the tourism-de­pen­dent seg­ments will find the go­ing tough even after the next phase of open­ing up, as long as bor­ders re­main closed to tourism. This patchy pic­ture has many im­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>First, it sug­gests, as gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials have pointed out, that gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance will need to be more nu­anced and tar­geted. Broadly speak­ing, com­pa­nies in sec­tors do­ing rel­a­tively well will need help to scale up, while those fac­ing a tem­po­rary de­mand shock will need cash-flow as­sis­tance. Oth­ers, which face the prospect of per­ma­nent dis­rup­tion, such as so­cial en­ter­tain­ment, will need help to pivot to new ar­eas, or to exit their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tance would need to be cal­i­brated even within seg­ments. For ex­am­ple, in hospitalit­y, smaller ho­tels and hos­tels face dif­fer­ent prospects from five-star chains which can of­fer staycation­s and food ser­vices; and in re­tail, su­per­mar­kets and on­line re­tail­ers are thriv­ing, while many small off­line re­tail­ers will need help.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, job match­ing will con­tinue to pose new chal­lenges. Work­ers who are vul­ner­a­ble to job losses are likely to come from quite dif­fer­ent sec­tors from those that are ex­pand­ing and look­ing to hire, which also high­lights the need for both train­ing and job redesign.</p>
    <p>Third, in­equal­i­ties are likely to in­crease, since the worst-hit sec­tors, such as hospitalit­y, off­line re­tail and en­ter­tain­ment, have higher con­cen­tra­tions of lower-in­come work­ers than sec­tors do­ing rel­a­tively well, such as fi­nance, tech­nol­ogy and bio-med. This will call for pro­gres­sive pol­icy ad­just­ments, whether through en­hance­ments to the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment, the ex­ten­sion of the pro­gres­sive wage model, or other mea­sures. Thus, while the eco­nomic down­turn posed unique pol­icy chal­lenges, the same will be true of the un­even re­cov­ery that we are wit­ness­ing.</p>
