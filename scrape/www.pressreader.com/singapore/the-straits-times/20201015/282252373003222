    <p>As Sin­ga­pore fought to clear for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries of Covid-19, ther­apy sup­port as­so­ciate Ar­vic Pe­naranda Man­dawe from Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal (TTSH) was de­ployed to Cochrane Lodge on June 20 to help mi­grant work­ers and dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Although the work­ing hours were sim­i­lar to those at the hospi­tal, car­ry­ing out tasks for up to eight hours in per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment made the days feel longer.</p>
    <p>Yet, dur­ing that month-long stint, Man­dawe, 42, found him­self run­ning more, clock­ing four to five 10km ses­sions weekly.</p>
    <p>He found it chal­leng­ing and it re­quired self-dis­ci­pline, but he was mo­ti­vated to keep his im­mune sys­tem strong for those around him.</p>
    <p>Man­dawe said: “We had a great team (in the dor­mi­tory) and ev­ery mem­ber looked for­ward to serv­ing each day de­spite the harsh and chal­leng­ing work en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“So that’s why I need to stay fit and healthy.</p>
    <p>“It was im­por­tant to me to boost my im­mune sys­tem so that at the same time, I could func­tion ef­fi­ciently.”</p>
    <p>The avid run­ner, who takes part in about eight or nine races yearly, also par­tic­i­pated in vir­tual runs.</p>
    <p>He first took part in the SG Cir­cuit Breaker Vir­tual Run, be­fore com­plet­ing 324km as part of the #SGOutrunCo­vid, one of the races sup­ported by TTSH’s hu­man re­source well­ness depart­ment.</p>
    <p>As part of its health and well-be­ing pro­gramme, the depart­ment has been spon­sor­ing staff for ex­ter­nal run­ning events, in­clud­ing The Straits Times Vir­tual Run (STVR), which Man­dawe will be tak­ing part in.</p>
    <p>He is among the 228 par­tic­i­pants from TTSH who have signed up for the race.</p>
    <p>“The thing that I like about vir­tual runs is that I can choose the place where I want to run and the time, es­pe­cially the place,” said Man­dawe, who will be tak­ing part in the 175km cat­e­gory, which be­gins on Mon­day and ends on Dec 17.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, I en­cour­aged some of my col­leagues to join me in that cat­e­gory so it will be part of my chal­lenge to help mo­ti­vate them to fin­ish.”</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­one who has signed up for this year’s STVR has had as much ex­pe­ri­ence with vir­tual runs.</p>
    <p>With many tra­di­tional mass par­tic­i­pa­tion events can­celled, senior nurse clin­i­cian Ng Poh Leng de­cided to try for the on­go­ing 17.5km cat­e­gory, which will fin­ish on Oct 23.</p>
    <p>The 63-year-old, who ex­er­cises two to three times a week, has been a vo­cal ad­vo­cate for ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­larly and feels that it is im­por­tant that she prac­tises what she preaches too.</p>
    <p>She said: “When you keep ac­tive, the per­son can lose weight, can keep the blood sugar down and keep their mind sharp and de-stress.</p>
    <p>“I also hope to be a role model to my pa­tient; you need to walk the talk.”</p>
    <p>Some like Christina Loh, as­sis­tant direc­tor of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases clin­i­cal oper­a­tions divi­sion, were drawn to the flex­i­bil­ity of the vir­tual run.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old said: “Vir­tual runs al­low me to com­plete cer­tain dis­tances with flex­i­bil­ity, in terms of se­lect­ing my routes and the time I want to run, at my own con­ve­nience.</p>
    <p>“It is also an av­enue to con­nect dig­i­tally with new run­ning kakis.”</p>
