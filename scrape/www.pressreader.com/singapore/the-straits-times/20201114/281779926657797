    <p>• Po­lice and sol­diers in the Philip­pines joined a search yes­ter­day for miss­ing peo­ple af­ter Typhoon Vamco killed at least 42 peo­ple, as res­i­dents re­turned to dev­as­tated homes fol­low­ing the worst flood­ing in years in Manila and nearby prov­inces.</p>
    <p>Vamco, the 21st and most deadly cy­clone to hit the coun­try this year, tore through the main is­land of Lu­zon late on Wed­nes­day and early Thurs­day, just as the coun­try was reel­ing from Goni, the world’s strong­est typhoon this year, which killed 25 peo­ple and flat­tened thou­sands of homes.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of homes were en­gulfed by the floods and as the wa­ters re­ceded in ar­eas such as Marik­ina, a sub­urb east of Manila, homes cov­ered in de­bris and caked in mud emerged.</p>
    <p>“All the houses here were sub­merged in mud and in wa­ter,” Mr Mike Ru­sio, 51, told Reuters as he scooped buck­ets full of mud from his two-storey home.</p>
    <p>Heavy equip­ment was be­ing brought in to clear fur­ni­ture de­bris, rub­bish and cars block­ing roads.</p>
    <p>Data pub­lished by the po­lice showed that 42 peo­ple had died, 43 were in­jured and 20 were still miss­ing. Suc­ces­sive typhoons – eight in the past two months – add to the chal­lenges on a gov­ern­ment bat­tling com­mu­nity coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and an eco­nomic re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The dis­as­ter agency said nearly 75,000 peo­ple were still packed into evac­u­a­tion cen­tres, some with­out proper sep­a­ra­tion be­tween fam­i­lies and many evac­uees not wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Fran­cisco Duque said makeshift shel­ters in­creased the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion, along­side lep­tospiro­sis and di­ar­rhoea. The Philip­pines has the sec­ond-high­est num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions and ca­su­al­ties in South-east Asia be­hind In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>About 450,000 house­holds in and around Manila re­main with­out power and vir­tual classes and gov­ern­ment work are still sus­pended in Lu­zon, home to half of the Philip­pines’ 108 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Vamco is ap­proach­ing cen­tral Viet­nam, where dev­as­tat­ing floods and mud­slides since early last month have killed at least 160 peo­ple. It is ex­pected to make land­fall to­day.</p>
