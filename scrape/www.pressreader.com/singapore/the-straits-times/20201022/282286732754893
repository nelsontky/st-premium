    <p>THOU­SAND OAKS (Cal­i­for­nia) • Tiger Woods would nor­mally be a good bet to suc­cess­fully de­fend his ti­tle at the Zozo Cham­pi­onship which starts to­day.</p>
    <p>He has a knack for dom­i­nat­ing at tour­na­ments he likes, and he should be highly mo­ti­vated as another win would be No. 83, break­ing him out of a tie with Sam Snead for most ca­reer PGA Tour ti­tles.</p>
    <p>But these are not nor­mal cir­cum­stances. Due to the coron­avirus pan­demic, the tour­na­ment, which is into its sec­ond year, has been tem­po­rar­ily moved from Ja­pan to Thou­sand Oaks, Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>But the Jack Nick­laus-de­signed Sher­wood Coun­try Club is made for Woods.</p>
    <p>The 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion has five wins and five run­ner-up fin­ishes in 12 starts when the Hero World Chal­lenge was held here from 2000 to 2013.</p>
    <p>So, yes – now he is an even bet­ter bet to de­fend, even if the field will be 78 play­ers.</p>
    <p>But why? What is it about Woods and Sher­wood?</p>
    <p>“I think if I’ve learnt any­thing over the years from Tiger, it’s how vis­ual he is and how he likes to shape shots,” said for­mer world No. 1 and four-time Ma­jor cham­pion Rory McIl­roy.</p>
    <p>“I think Sher­wood, all the holes are framed so nicely and you can see shots there so eas­ily. I can see how Tiger’s done so well there.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, Sher­wood, set in a val­ley sur­rounded by jagged moun­tains and hill­sides, is easy on the eyes.</p>
    <p>There are el­e­vated tees and greens, and at 7,098 yards, the course is not what you would call overly long, mak­ing it “a great fit” for Woods.</p>
    <p>“Sher­wood’s the per­fect ex­am­ple of get the ball in play and go play your game from there,” said world No. 45 Rickie Fowler.</p>
    <p>“And he’s been one of the best iron play­ers of all time, so get the ball in play and then go score from there.”</p>
    <p>The l egend of Woods at this</p>
    <p>South­ern Cal­i­for­nia playground for celebritie­s – Will Smith, Justin Tim­ber­lake, Jane Sey­mour and Wayne Gret­zky are among the mem­bers – be­gan when he beat David Du­val, two and one, in the made-for-TV Show­down At Sher­wood in 1999.</p>
    <p>Then Woods re­ally got hot. He beat Vi­jay Singh by three at the Hero two years later.</p>
    <p>He beat Padraig Har­ring­ton by two in 2004, Ge­off Ogilvy by four in 2006, and Zach John­son by seven af­ter his 22-un­der ef­fort in 2007.</p>
    <p>Woods birdied the last two holes to beat John­son again in 2011, his first vic­tory of any kind in over two years since the 2009 Aus­tralian Masters, be­fore the lat­ter got his re­venge in the 2013 play-off.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing that day was Matthew Wolff, then 14, who grew up in nearby Agoura Hills and went to West­lake High School just 11km away.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old, who fin­ished sec­ond at last month’s US Open and joint-fourth at the PGA Cham­pi­onship in Au­gust, will be in the field at Zozo.</p>
    <p>“I’ve played that course 1,000 times,” he said. “I have a bunch of friends that were mem­bers there grow­ing up, and I was for­tu­nate enough that they brought me out.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally look­ing for­ward to go­ing home and see­ing some fam­ily and friends and play­ing pretty much a home course for me.”</p>
    <p>But so is a cer­tain big cat with his eye on No. 83. The leg­end of Tiger and Sher­wood, al­ready chock-full of vic­to­ries and thrills, may be about to get its own Hol­ly­wood end­ing.</p>
    <p>PER­FECT FIT</p>
    <p>All the holes are framed so nicely and you can see shots there so eas­ily. I can see how Tiger’s done so well there.</p>
    <p>RORY MCIL­ROY, on the Sher­wood course.</p>
