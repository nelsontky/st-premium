    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Try not to fo­cus on small mis­takes, but see the big pic­ture. Your en­ergy re­quires a push to get mov­ing, but some­times, it is best to go slow.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>It is a great time to let some­one know how you feel or just snug­gle up with your sweetie. Push your­self and see where you end up.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You need to clar­ify some­thing to a fam­ily mem­ber, but it is harder than usual to get him or her to un­der­stand what you are feel­ing.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>The lit­tle stuff is im­por­tant, so fo­cus on the de­tails that make the world work. Your en­ergy is perfect for get­ting to the bot­tom of mys­ter­ies.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your men­tal state is perfect for fig­ur­ing out your fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion and make it even bet­ter by ap­ply­ing your in­spired com­mon sense.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22) Re­or­gan­ise your life. You can get your­self back on track and the next few months go by eas­ier as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Some­times, do­ing noth­ing at all is the best so­lu­tion. Stress should melt away and you should be back in the game by to­mor­row at the lat­est.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>A friend comes to your res­cue, even though you did not need it. Thank him or her – it is good to re­mem­ber that some­one has got your back.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Han­dle the lit­tle de­tails with care. Even if you find them all bor­ing, you have to make sure you are as re­spon­si­ble as you can be.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) In­for­ma­tion comes your way that con­firms an idea that has been on your mind. The odds are good that this is a pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) Work-re­lated is­sues are driv­ing you crazy, so get your­self some time off. You may still need to deal with one per­son who can­not take a hint.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20) Fig­ure out the most im­por­tant peo­ple in a tricky sit­u­a­tion and fo­cus on them. You can turn this into some­thing pos­i­tive.</p>
