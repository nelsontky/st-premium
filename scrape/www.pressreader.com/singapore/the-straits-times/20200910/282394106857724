    <p>LON­DON • A 13-game un­beaten run to fin­ish last sea­son in third place is un­likely to be the launch­pad for a gen­uine Premier League ti­tle chal­lenge this soon, but there are real signs Manch­ester United can en­trench them­selves in the top four.</p>
    <p>Since their last cham­pi­onship win in 2013, the Red Devils have never fin­ished in the Cham­pi­ons League places in suc­ces­sive terms.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is a feel­ing around Old Traf­ford that de­spite a third straight year with­out sil­ver­ware, the team can kick on off the back of that sec­ond-half streak.</p>
    <p>The club’s hi­er­ar­chy have thrown their weight be­hind Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer since his per­ma­nent ap­point­ment in March of last year, back­ing him in the trans­fer mar­ket to leave no doubt his po­si­tion is se­cure.</p>
    <p>Yet if United are to end their ti­tle drought, the Nor­we­gian has ad­mit­ted they need to spend more to catch up with the two most likely con­tenders, cham­pi­ons Liver­pool and Manch­ester City.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer said: “We’re still not where we want to be, close enough to chal­lenge for the Premier League tro­phy but we take one step at a time. Ob­vi­ously City and Liver­pool the last cou­ple of sea­sons have put the standard where it should be to win the league... let’s see how much we can in­vest for next sea­son.”</p>
    <p>United have al­ready brought in Donny van de Beek from Ajax for £40 mil­lion (S$71 mil­lion) and while there is an ob­vi­ous jump in qual­ity from the Ere­di­visie to the Premier League, the 23-year-old should add guile and tenac­ity to their mid­field once he set­tles in.</p>
    <p>With 10 strikes over­all last sea­son, the Dutch in­ter­na­tional scored three more than Ne­manja Matic, Fred and Scott McTom­i­nay com­bined and is ex­pected to form a new deep-ly­ing part­ner­ship with one of them.</p>
    <p>For­mer United mid­fielder Dar­ren Fletcher al­ready likes what he saw, hail­ing van de Beek’s flex­i­bil­ity – he can also play as a No. 10 or box-to-box mid­fielder – and call­ing him a “top-class player”.</p>
    <p>His goals and qual­ity will add depth to United’s squad, which is not short of fire­power.</p>
    <p>Bruno Fer­nan­des has had a trans­for­ma­tive ef­fect since his Jan­uary move from Sport­ing Lis­bon, scor­ing 12 times in 22 out­ings, while Paul Pogba ap­pears to be over the in­jury prob­lems that lim­ited him to just eight games be­fore March.</p>
    <p>An­thony Mar­tial and Marcus Rash­ford both en­joyed ca­reerbest cam­paigns in front of goal and young­ster Ma­son Green­wood com­pletes an at­tack­ing trio who are the envy of most teams.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial block­buster sign­ing of Jadon San­cho will only add to the em­bar­rass­ment of riches up front, though, there re­mains a sus­pi­cion the squad is top-heavy.</p>
    <p>The de­fence has not been con­vinc­ing even be­fore Sol­sk­jaer’s ar­rival, and the pres­ence of Harry Maguire, the world’s most ex­pen­sive de­fender at £80 mil­lion, has not changed that out­look.</p>
    <p>While United had the third­stingi­est back­line last term, con­ced­ing 36 goals to Liver­pool’s 33, there were mo­ments that sug­gested Maguire’s part­ner­ship with Vic­tor Lin­de­lof, while func­tional, would strug­gle to reach the stan­dards set by Rio Fer­di­nand and Ne­manja Vidic.</p>
    <p>It is some­thing for­mer United striker Dim­i­tar Ber­ba­tov has also iden­ti­fied, call­ing on Sol­sk­jaer to “find some­one who can ac­com­mo­date Harry”.</p>
    <p>The last line of de­fence is an­other worry with David de Gea in­creas­ingly shaky. Since 2018, the Spa­niard has made seven er­rors lead­ing to a di­rect goal, with only Ever­ton’s Jor­dan Pick­ford and New­cas­tle’s Martin Dubravka worse (eight) in the league.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer re­ward­ing Dean Hen­der­son with a bumper long-term con­tract fol­low­ing his loan spell at Sh­effield United, how­ever, is an in­di­ca­tion that any fur­ther drop in stan­dards will re­sult in a new No. 1.</p>
    <p>With the trans­fer win­dow clos­ing only on Oct 5, United have time to get a cou­ple more new faces to show their in­tent in chal­leng­ing for the big­gest hon­ours again.</p>
