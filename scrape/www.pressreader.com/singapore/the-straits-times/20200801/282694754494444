    <p>LON­DON • How much does it cost to power the home of a celebrity in Bri­tain?</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Uswitch, a Bri­tain­based price com­par­i­son ser­vice and switch­ing web­site, pop star El­ton John (above) spent a whop­ping £49,139 (S$88,300) a year on his en­ergy bills.</p>
    <p>The web­site said his bills are 43 times higher than those of an av­er­age house­hold in Bri­tain, but it noted that the Rocket Man singer’s 3,000 sq m house in Wind­sor is 33 times big­ger than many homes in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>John, 73, ranked fourth on this year’s The Sun­day Times Rich List for Bri­tish mu­si­cians, with an es­ti­mated for­tune of £360 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his util­ity bills are topped by those of Queen Elizabeth II, es­ti­mated by Uswitch to be £1.1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The web­site says it is not sur­pris­ing as Buck­ing­ham Palace, the 94-year-old monarch’s of­fi­cial res­i­dence, has 240 bedrooms over an area of 77,000 sq m, with light­ing alone con­tribut­ing to £28,000 of the bills.</p>
    <p>Pop star Rob­bie Wil­liams, 46, is third on the list, chalk­ing up more than £33,000 a year in en­ergy bills.</p>
    <p>The for­mer mem­ber of boy band Take That owns a 10-bed­room home in Lon­don, which has a gym, 22 bath­rooms and a cinema.</p>
    <p>Then, there is celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, 45, who spent an es­ti­mated £32,875 to power his home, which has nine bedrooms, a swim­ming pool and an Aga cooker.</p>
    <p>Uswitch reck­ons Shape Of You singer Ed Sheeran, 29, spends more than £21,000 a year on his 18-bed­room es­tate – dubbed “Sheer­anville” – which comes with a swim­ming pool, a pub and a record­ing stu­dio.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Ge­orge Clooney, English foot­baller Wayne Rooney, en­ter­tain­ment mogul Si­mon Cow­ell, Rooney’s for­mer Manch­ester United team­mate David Beck­ham and For­mula One world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton round up the top 10 high­est con­sumers of en­ergy.</p>
