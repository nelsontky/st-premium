    <p>JERUSALEM • The treaty Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) will sign this week will not fully nor­malise ties, but will be the start of a year-long process that could pro­tect the Gulf na­tion’s in­ter­ests as it lob­bies to buy the US’s top war­plane, ac­cord­ing to two peo­ple briefed on the pact.</p>
    <p>The plan is for both sides to raise co­op­er­a­tion over the course of a year, start­ing with eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion, con­tin­u­ing with deep­ened se­cu­rity and in­tel­li­gence ties, then cul­mi­nat­ing in the ex­change of am­bas­sadors, they said.</p>
    <p>While phased agree­ments run the risk of never ripen­ing into sub­se­quent stages, the Emi­ratis ap­par­ently con­cluded that is “less risky then wak­ing up one morn­ing and find­ing out that their ma­jor move – his­toric move – turns into a fi­asco”, said Dr Nim­rod Novik, a vet­eran Is­raeli peace ne­go­tia­tor and fel­low at the Is­rael Pol­icy Fo­rum think tank.</p>
    <p>The sign­ing cer­e­mony is sched­uled to take place to­day at the White House. Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu will be there but the de facto leader of the UAE, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Zayed, will not, de­tract­ing from what has been touted as a “his­toric” first agree­ment be­tween Is­rael and a Gulf Arab state.</p>
    <p>Drawn to­gether by a shared dis­trust of Iran and mu­tual in­ter­est in tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion, Is­rael and the UAE went pub­lic last month with their in­ten­tion to for­malise decades of be­hind-thescenes co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­though full nor­mal­i­sa­tion will be at least months away, Is­rael and the US stand to ben­e­fit from the op­tics of to­day’s cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>For Mr Ne­tanyahu, it is a dis­trac­tion from a bun­gled re­sponse to a rag­ing coro­n­avirus out­break and his cor­rup­tion trial. For Mr Trump, it boosts his claims to ad­vanc­ing peace in the Middle East as he faces a tough re-elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>For the UAE, though, the step-bystep ap­proach to nor­mal­i­sa­tion of­fers time to mea­sure re­gional re­ac­tions to the treaty and main­tain lever­age over Is­rael and the United States as it seeks ad­vanced Amer­i­can weaponry, in­clud­ing Lock­heed Martin’s F-35 stealth fighter.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has hinted he is open to such a sale, but Is­rael ob­jects, say­ing it would com­pro­mise its weapons edge in the re­gion, which the US has long vowed to main­tain.</p>
    <p>“The United Arab Emi­rates pri­ori­tises the strate­gic se­cu­rity as­pect of the deal as op­posed to the eco­nomic and diplo­matic, peo­ple-to-peo­ple re­la­tions,” said Dr Fawaz Gerges, Middle Eastern politics pro­fes­sor at the Lon­don School of Eco­nom­ics. This in­cludes the UAE ob­tain­ing ad­vanced weaponry, par­tic­u­larly the F-35, and ad­vanced US drones, he added.</p>
    <p>Full-fledged nor­mal­i­sa­tion also re­mains tricky for the UAE be­cause of re­sis­tance within the Arab world as long as the Is­raeli-Pales­tinian con­flict is not re­solved.</p>
    <p>The Gulf na­tion has made much of the fact that Is­rael had agreed to sus­pend an­nex­a­tion of West Bank land the Pales­tini­ans claim for a state as a con­di­tion of this deal.</p>
    <p>But if Is­rael’s frac­tious coali­tion breaks down and the coun­try heads to the polls again, Mr Ne­tanyahu could come un­der pres­sure once more to prom­ise an­nex­a­tion to shore up his hawk­ish flank.</p>
    <p>And if Mr Trump is not re­elected, with­hold­ing full nor­mal­i­sa­tion un­til after the vote gives the UAE clout with a new ad­min­is­tra­tion. “By keep­ing a per­sonal dis­tance from a sign­ing cer­e­mony, he (Prince Mo­hammed bin Zayed) keeps his op­tions open” in the sense of not hav­ing “per­sonal own­er­ship of the sign­ing cer­e­mony”, said Dr Gerges.</p>
