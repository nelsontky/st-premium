    <p>Flower ven­dors and for­tune tell­ers with makeshift stalls near two pop­u­lar tem­ples in Water­loo Street will need a li­cence from next year to op­er­ate in des­ig­nated lots, as the au­thor­i­ties move in to deal with crowd­ing and ob­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>From Jan 4, the 41 street ven­dors will have to pro­gres­sively move into these al­lo­cated lots, which mea­sure 2m by 1.5m.</p>
    <p>This will en­sure there is safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween street ven­dors in the area and un­ob­structed fire en­gine ac­cess, and also al­low pedes­tri­ans more room to walk, the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA), Sin­ga­pore Food Agency and Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently, the pedes­trian mall is of­ten busy and filled with stall set­ups and dis­carded boxes that ob­struct the path­ways.</p>
    <p>“These are not con­ducive to both the street ven­dors and vis­i­tors to the area, and are po­ten­tial fire haz­ards,” the agen­cies said.</p>
    <p>By con­gre­gat­ing in close prox­im­ity, the street ven­dors also pose pub­lic health and safety con­cerns in view of the Covid-19 pan­demic, they added.</p>
    <p>The ven­dors com­prise 19 for­tune tell­ers, 19 flower ven­dors, two re­flex­ol­o­gists and one cob­bler.</p>
    <p>The flower ven­dors will be al­lo­cated space closer to the tem­ples, said the agen­cies.</p>
    <p>For decades, ven­dors had been free to choose where to op­er­ate on the pedes­trian mall in front of the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Tem­ple and Sri Kr­ish­nan Tem­ple.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, be­sides the des­ig­nated spots, they will also need to ob­tain a tem­po­rary oc­cu­pa­tion li­cence, which will cost $48.15 a month.</p>
    <p>The agen­cies said those who face fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties can ap­proach the SLA for as­sis­tance. The ven­dors will have to start pay­ing the li­cence fee only from next June.</p>
    <p>All ex­ist­ing ven­dors will be granted a lot, which will be al­lo­cated via bal­lot­ing.</p>
    <p>The SLA said the li­cence, which is re­new­able on a three-year ba­sis sub­ject to rede­vel­op­ment plans, is not trans­fer­able, and the 41 ven­dors are not al­lowed to sub­let their stalls.</p>
    <p>No new li­cence will be granted should an ex­ist­ing vendor re­tire.</p>
    <p>Works to cre­ate the space for ven­dors will be done in phases with no dis­rup­tion to their busi­nesses, the SLA added.</p>
    <p>Ms Denise Phua, an MP for Jalan Be­sar GRC, who over­sees the area around Water­loo Street, said res­i­dents have, over the years, asked for the area to be made cleaner, safer and less clut­tered.</p>
    <p>“I’m heart­ened that the agen­cies are en­sur­ing that all ex­ist­ing ven­dors will each be given a lot, and all of them can con­tinue to ply their trade,” she said, adding that the au­thor­i­ties have done their best to bal­ance the needs of all</p>
    <p>BUSI­NESS AS USUAL</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties as­sured us that we will still be near the tem­ple, and our reg­u­lar cus­tomers will still know where to find us.</p>
    <p>FLOWER VENDOR CATHERINE TEO</p>
    <p>stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The 41 ven­dors, who have on av­er­age been op­er­at­ing there for be­tween 10 and 15 years, were in­formed of the changes yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They in­clude re­flex­ol­o­gist Ng Song Hua, 78, who has been serv­ing cus­tomers in the area for 18 years. He said he un­der­stands the ra­tio­nale for the move, adding that the $48.15 fee is a rea­son­able sum.</p>
    <p>“The only is­sue is that we will now have a smaller space to work in and cus­tomers who use wheel­chairs may not be fully shel­tered. It’ll be good if we can get a bit more space,” said Mr Ng, whose cur­rent stall oc­cu­pies an area mea­sur­ing 4.5m by 2m.</p>
    <p>Flower vendor Catherine Teo, 65, whose fam­ily has been run­ning a stall in the area since the 1960s, said: “The changes will make the area more at­trac­tive for tourists.”</p>
    <p>She doubts the move will im­pact her busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“The au­thor­i­ties as­sured us that we will still be near the tem­ple, and our reg­u­lar cus­tomers will still know where to find us,” she said.</p>
