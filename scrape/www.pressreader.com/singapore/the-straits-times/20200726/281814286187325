    <p>Car buy­ers face a smaller sup­ply of cer­tifi­cates of en­ti­tle­ment (COEs) for the Au­gust-Oc­to­ber quota pe­riod, with 6,207 COEs avail­able for bid­ding in each of those months, the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes the Open cat­e­gory, which can be used for any ve­hi­cle type ex­cept mo­tor­cy­cles, but mostly ends up be­ing used for big­ger cars.</p>
    <p>This is a 28.9 per cent drop from the cur­rent 8,737 COEs.</p>
    <p>The quota is de­ter­mined largely by the num­ber of cars taken off the road in the pre­ced­ing quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with July, Au­gust to Oc­to­ber’s quo­tas are lower, as there were fewer ve­hi­cles dereg­is­tered in the April to June pe­riod, an LTA spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Fewer cars were dereg­is­tered be­cause scrap­yards and ex­port pro­cess­ing zones were closed dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, which started in early April, said Mr Ray­mond Tang, hon­orary sec­re­tary of the Sin­ga­pore Ve­hi­cle Traders As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, car own­ers whose dis­posal dead­line fell within the cir­cuit breaker were given ex­ten­sions to dis­pose of their ve­hi­cles,” he said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, there might be an in­crease in COE quo­tas for the Novem­ber-Jan­uary pe­riod as more peo­ple scrap their cars be­tween July and Septem­ber.”</p>
    <p>The COE sup­ply for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp will be at an av­er­age of 1,967 a month, down 23.4 per cent from 2,568 now.</p>
    <p>The sup­ply for cars above 1,600cc or 130bhp will av­er­age 1,729, down 33 per cent from 2,581 now.</p>
    <p>In the Open cat­e­gory, 903 COEs a month will be avail­able, 2.26 per cent more than the 883 now.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE bid­ders will have 674 cer­tifi­cates a month, 31 per cent fewer than the 978 now.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor­cy­cle bid­ders will have 934 COEs a month, 45.9 per cent fewer than the 1,727 cur­rently.</p>
    <p>The ac­cu­mu­lated COE quota of 19,490 from the sus­pended bid­ding ex­er­cises from April to June is be­ing re­turned to the mar­ket over 12 months from this month to June next year. One-third of the ac­cu­mu­lated quota, equiv­a­lent to 6,494 COEs, will be re­turned from July to Septem­ber this year. The re­main­ing two-thirds of the ac­cu­mu­lated quota – 12,996 COEs – will be re­turned over the sub­se­quent nine months from Oc­to­ber this year to June next year.</p>
