    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s party was locked in a tight con­test yes­ter­day in the Bihar vote, In­dia’s first elec­tion held amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a ju­nior part­ner in the pre­vi­ous rul­ing coali­tion, started cel­e­brat­ing early as it be­came clear that it had done ex­ceed­ingly well in spite of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The trends show that its han­dling of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, in­clud­ing a sud­den and strin­gent na­tional lock­down that led to much eco­nomic stress, has not had a neg­a­tive po­lit­i­cal im­pact on the BJP in Bihar or af­fected the pop­u­lar­ity of Mr Modi, who cam­paigned ex­ten­sively in the east­ern state.</p>
    <p>Bihar was the state worst hit by the lock­down, with hun­dreds of thou­sands of Bi­hari mi­grants through­out In­dia suf­fer­ing af­ter los­ing their jobs and be­ing un­able to re­turn home im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>On one side of the con­test in Bihar is the Na­tional Demo­cratic Al­liance, a coali­tion be­tween the BJP and Janata Dal (United), a re­gional party, whose leader Ni­tish Ku­mar is the state’s chief min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion al­liance is led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), an­other re­gional party, along with the Congress and Left par­ties.</p>
    <p>The trends and re­sults so far show that the BJP had eclipsed its re­gional ally, and was in a tight fight with the RJD for the most num­ber of seats in the 243-seat state assem­bly.</p>
    <p>The BJP al­liance was ahead with 123 seats, more than needed for a ma­jor­ity, while the op­po­si­tion al­liance had 111 seats. Seat count, how­ever, was still fluc­tu­at­ing.</p>
    <p>The Elec­tion Com­mis­sion said re­sults had been de­layed be­cause of an in­crease in polling booths as part of safe prac­tices amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“The count­ing of the votes used to take place in 38 lo­ca­tions. Now, due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic guide­lines, it is tak­ing place at 55 lo­ca­tions,” deputy elec­tion com­mis­sioner Chan­dra Bhushan told a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Among In­dia’s poor­est states, Bihar still has an im­pact on na­tional pol­i­tics be­cause of its vast pop­u­la­tion, which stands at more than 100 mil­lion. It was once a law­less state over­run by crim­i­nal gangs, with kid­nap­ping known as the most lu­cra­tive ven­ture, un­der a pre­vi­ous RJD-led state gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Ku­mar, who came to power in Bihar 15 years ago, man­aged to bring law and or­der to the state, but has fallen vic­tim to anti-in­cum­bency sen­ti­ment among vot­ers.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the state polls clearly show that Mr Modi’s pop­u­lar­ity has not di­min­ished dur­ing the pan­demic and in­stead has given a boost to the BJP, which has strug­gled to win state elec­tions over the past four years.</p>
    <p>“PM Modi re­tains his per­sonal pop­u­lar­ity and in­su­lates BJP from anti-in­cum­bency... So iron­i­cally, both Modi and Te­jashwi (Ya­dav) have be­come sym­bols of a po­lit­i­cal and gen­er­a­tional shift,” said Pro­fes­sor Ash­wani Ku­mar of the Tata In­sti­tute of So­cial Sciences who is the au­thor of Com­mu­nity Warriors: State, Peas­ants And Caste Armies In Bihar.</p>
    <p>The polls wit­nessed the rise of a new po­lit­i­cal star in Mr Te­jashwi Ya­dav, 30, who tapped into the pop­u­lar mood by promis­ing 10 mil­lion gov­ern­ment jobs to vot­ers.</p>
    <p>He took over from his fa­ther, Laloo Prasad Ya­dav, one of In­dia’s most recog­nis­able po­lit­i­cal fig­ures, who is in jail fol­low­ing a cor­rup­tion case.</p>
    <p>“The way Te­jashwi fought elec­tions will of­fer in­spi­ra­tion to many young­sters. To­day’s re­sults may not have brought change but have paved the way for change,” vet­eran po­lit­i­cal leader Sharad Pawar, pres­i­dent of the Na­tion­al­ist Congress Party, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the state polls clearly show that Mr Naren­dra Modi’s pop­u­lar­ity had not di­min­ished dur­ing the pan­demic and in­stead has given a boost to the BJP, which has strug­gled to win state elec­tions over the past four years.</p>
