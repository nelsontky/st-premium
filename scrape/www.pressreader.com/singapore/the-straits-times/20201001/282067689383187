    <p>A long-de­layed reg­u­la­tory frame­work to level the play­ing field be­tween cab­bies and pri­vate-hire driv­ers will kick in soon.</p>
    <p>Asked for an up­date on the reg­u­la­tory frame­work for the point-to-point (P2P) trans­port sec­tor, the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) said it would start later this month.</p>
    <p>The frame­work has been in the works for about three years now, with the pass­ing of the P2P Pas­sen­ger Trans­port In­dus­try Act in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>The frame­work was to have taken ef­fect by June this year. But be­cause of the Covid-19 cri­sis, which has dis­rupted trans­port de­mand, it was post­poned to last month, and then to this month.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the frame­work will take ef­fect in the lat­ter half of the month.</p>
    <p>With it, op­er­a­tors will in­cur li­cens­ing fees that are pegged to their re­spec­tive rev­enue.</p>
    <p>For a street-hail ser­vice li­cence, which al­lows driv­ers to pick up pas­sen­gers on the street, the fee is 0.3 per cent of the li­censee’s gross an­nual rev­enue.</p>
    <p>For a ride-hail­ing li­cence, which re­stricts a li­censee to only phone­hailed rides, op­er­a­tors are to pay a fee equiv­a­lent to 0.6 per cent of their gross rev­enue.</p>
    <p>While the frame­work is ex­pected to ad­dress an uneven play­ing field, stake­hold­ers and ob­servers reckon more can be done.</p>
    <p>A Grab spokesman said that while the com­pany “sup­ports the in­tent” of the frame­work, all ride-hail and car­pool plat­form op­er­a­tors should be re­quired to build in-app safety features such as num­ber mask­ing, an emer­gency but­ton, shar­ing of real-time ride lo­ca­tion and driver iden­tity au­then­ti­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>She said child seats should also be a re­quire­ment for both pri­vate-hire cars and taxis. They are cur­rently not re­quired for the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the anti-com­pet­i­tive clause of the frame­work, Grab said the “cur­rent in­con­sis­tency whereby taxi op­er­a­tors can re­strict their driv­ers from tak­ing fixed-fare jobs on other plat­forms” should be ad­dressed “as soon as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences trans­port econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira said: “The most im­por­tant thing about the P2P frame­work is that, in prin­ci­ple, it gives LTA sim­i­lar pow­ers over both taxi op­er­a­tors and pri­vate-hire firms.”</p>
    <p>But As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Th­e­seira said the frame­work does not level the play­ing field com­pletely.</p>
    <p>“An area which re­mains an ob­vi­ous prob­lem is the dif­fer­ence in reg­u­la­tory treat­ment of taxis and pri­vate-hire cars. Taxi op­er­a­tors con­tinue to suf­fer from a lack of flex­i­bil­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Taxis can­not be re­pur­posed read­ily. Pri­vate-hire cars have al­ways had flex­i­bil­ity to be con­verted to be­ing a nor­mal pas­sen­ger car.”</p>
    <p>This be­comes a big stick­ing point “when you have a big down­turn like this”, Prof Th­e­seira added.</p>
    <p>“For the same rea­son, when there is a sharp re­cov­ery, pri­vate-hire fleets can ex­pand quickly, but taxis can’t un­less the reg­u­la­tory frame­work be­comes more flex­i­ble.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Hin Kee, ad­viser to the Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion and the Na­tional Pri­vate Hire Ve­hi­cles As­so­ci­a­tion, said com­pa­nies should go be­yond their busi­ness of match­ing driv­ers to pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>“Take up the re­spon­si­bil­ity of help­ing driv­ers with their Medis­ave, re­tire­ment and train­ing needs,” he sug­gested.</p>
    <p>He said that while driv­ers are not em­ploy­ees, they are key to the suc­cess of th­ese busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“Plat­forms need to work with car rental com­pa­nies to en­sure that they can­not dis­as­so­ci­ate them­selves from re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to the driv­ers just be­cause one leases the car and the other matches pas­sen­gers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ang said ride-hail­ing plat­forms should also “level up” their con­tri­bu­tion to the fi­nan­cial aid given to driv­ers dur­ing this pan­demic.</p>
