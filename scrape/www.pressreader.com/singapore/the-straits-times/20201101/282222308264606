    <p>In T.S. Eliot’s fa­mous poem The Love Song Of J. Al­fred Pru­fock, there is a line which goes: “I have mea­sured out my life in cof­fee spoons.”</p>
    <p>It is the lament of a lonely and dis­en­chanted mid­dle-aged man about his dull and pre­dictable life.</p>
    <p>Ms Pamela Chng’s re­la­tion­ship with cof­fee, how­ever, is far less mo­rose and a lot more up­lift­ing.</p>
    <p>“I never imag­ined I could start a new ca­reer at 35 and even­tu­ally be­come a cof­fee ed­u­ca­tor, roaster, world j udge and sit­ting on the global spe­cial­ity cof­fee board,” says the for­mer Web con­sul­tant.</p>
    <p>“From a sim­ple bev­er­age that just brought me plea­sure, it’s be­come a ve­hi­cle for so many as­pects of my life to play out.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chng is the founder of Bettr Barista, a cof­fee busi­ness which cham­pi­ons so­cially re­spon­si­ble prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Be­sides run­ning a chain of re­tail out­lets and an acad­emy pro­vid­ing spe­cial­ity cof­fee ed­u­ca­tion, Sin­ga­pore’s first B-cor­po­ra­tion – an out­fit which uses busi­ness as a force for good – has a so­cial pro­gramme to help marginalis­ed women and youth at risk, equip­ping them not just with em­ploy­able cof­fee skills, but also men­tal and emo­tional re­silience.</p>
    <p>The set-up also of­fers con­sul­tancy ser­vices, cof­fee-themed team-build­ing pro­grammes for cor­po­ra­tions, and sells ma­chines and other cof­fee para­pher­na­lia. It has a roast­ing fa­cil­ity too, whole­sal­ing cof­fee beans sourced from com­mu­nity-fo­cused, sus­tain­able cof­fee farms around the world.</p>
    <p>In­deed, cof­fee has been a game changer for Ms Chng. Her par­ents ran a con­struc­tion and man­u­fac­tur­ing busi­ness and she started life as an obe­di­ent and rule-abid­ing Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>“I was fear­ful of what peo­ple said, went down the good Sin­ga­porean path and didn’t get into any trou­ble,” says the for­mer Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Girls’ School stu­dent, who later stud­ied so­ci­ol­ogy and lit­er­a­ture at the Uni­ver­sity of Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old cut her teeth pro­fes­sion­ally do­ing ad sales and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment for Asi­aOne upon grad­u­a­tion in 1999.</p>
    <p>Four years later – dur­ing which she saw the dot.com bub­ble burst – she started Web con­sul­tancy Dig­i­tal Boomerang. For the next eight years, she did Web work and con­tent for gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The pace was gru­elling. Be­cause de­vel­op­ments in the tech world hap­pen at such a rapid pace, eight years in the busi­ness was akin to 20 years i n a nor­mal work­ing en­vi­ron­ment, she says.</p>
    <p>Al­though she learnt a lot, burnout set in. “I was prob­a­bly de­pressed too,” she says can­didly.</p>
    <p>“I told my­self there had to be more to life. I could have car­ried on and be com­fort­able, but money was not a mo­ti­va­tor. I worked hard, but I told my­self I needed a rea­son for do­ing so,” she says, adding that the fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2008 also prompted deep re­flec­tion.</p>
    <p>So, she took a year off to sort out her thoughts. “I j ust wanted to learn again. I went to film school and cof­fee school and around the world – Aus­tralia, Italy and the United States,” she says.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this time, she read Mar­garet Brindle’s book So­cial</p>
    <p>En­trepreneur­ship For De­vel­op­ment “It re­ally spoke to me,” she says. “How can a busi­ness be con­structed and grown sus­tain­ably so that it has a pos­i­tive im­pact in ev­ery­thing it does?”</p>
    <p>That was when she started to think about us­ing her pas­sion – cof­fee – as a ve­hi­cle to change lives and make the world a bet­ter place.</p>
    <p>And so, Bettr Barista was born in 2011.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised there was mar­ket vi­a­bil­ity, huge po­ten­tial for growth and it was also an in­dus­try with many op­por­tu­ni­ties to cre­ate so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact. There was de­mand for more tal­ent and higher stan­dards in the in­dus­try, which called for ed­u­ca­tion,” she says.</p>
    <p>“There was de­mand for higher qual­ity spe­cial­ity cof­fee, which called for bet­ter qual­ity cof­fee ex­pe­ri­ences. There was de­mand for baris­tas in the mar­ket, which led to op­por­tu­ni­ties for marginalis­ed groups to ac­quire skills and sus­tain­able jobs. It was the right in­dus­try at the right time.”</p>
    <p>She also wanted to do some­thing about sys­temic is­sues in the cof­fee value chain.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve cof­fee needs to be more equal and in­clu­sive across the en­tire chain if we want to be able to cre­ate more sus­tain­able and eq­ui­table con­di­tions for all seg­ments of the cof­fee in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>Bettr Barista has scooped up a bag of awards over the years. It was a re­cip­i­ent of DBS Foun­da­tion’s so­cial en­ter­prise grant in 2015, the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge So­cial En­ter­prise of the Year win­ner in 2017 and a Best For The World (Com­mu­nity) or­gan­i­sa­tion from 2016 to last year.</p>
    <p>It has eight re­tail out­lets and its cof­fee acad­emy has trained more than 5,500 peo­ple from 30 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Zim­babwe and Ro­ma­nia.</p>
    <p>Ms Chng has notched up sev­eral per­sonal achieve­ments too.</p>
    <p>A judge in sev­eral in­ter­na­tional cof­fee com­pe­ti­tions in­clud­ing the World Barista Cham­pi­onship, she is also the first Sin­ga­porean on the Board of Di­rec­tors of the global Spe­cialty Cof­fee As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>She is chuffed that cof­fee has al­lowed her to do her bit for the so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal spheres.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a so­cial lu­bri­cant to have con­ver­sa­tions about im­por­tant and dif­fi­cult top­ics – whether it is in­equal­ity, sus­tain­abil­ity, men­tal health or other met­rics of suc­cess in busi­ness and life.”</p>
    <p>You have gone through quite a few crises – the dot.com crash, Sars, the Lehman Broth­ers col­lapse and, now, Covid-19. What have they taught you about busi­ness, life and hu­man­ity?</p>
    <p>Crises desta­bilise and up­set ex­ist­ing struc­tures of func­tion­ing. They sur­face the bro­ken-ness and pres­sure points in a sys­tem and de­stroy many el­e­ments in ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>They are also turn­ing points, rep­re­sent­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for change and cre­at­ing new sys­tems of be­ing that can be bet­ter than be­fore.</p>
    <p>In times of crises, the most im­por­tant thing for a busi­ness is the agility to adapt and sur­vive. You need a strong team to do what­ever is re­quired to make things hap­pen. It is in a cri­sis where you dis­cover the strength of your cul­ture and reaf­firm your rea­son for be­ing.</p>
    <p>Each cri­sis presents an op­por­tu­nity to deeply re­flect on why it hap­pened in the first place, what went wrong, what we need to do to fix things and cre­ate a bet­ter sys­tem mov­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>As we have to suf­fer through the pain, how do we learn to ac­cept things out­side of our con­trol, fo­cus on chang­ing things we do have con­trol over and do that sanely and healthily?</p>
    <p>We are a re­silient and adapt­able species and have sur­vived count­less crises since the be­gin­ning of time. But if we don’t start tak­ing some real ac­tion about how we are ex­ploit­ing our so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal sys­tems in the pur­suit of nar­row met­rics of suc­cess, we are head­ing to­wards self-de­struc­tion faster than our an­ces­tors could have pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing taken a year off to travel and fig­ure things out, what ad­vice would you give to peo­ple who feel lost and un­ful­filled pro­fes­sion­ally?</p>
    <p>That first, it’s okay, and not to beat your­self up about it. When you feel lost and un­ful­filled, it’s usu­ally be­cause your head, heart and hands are not in align­ment. You can learn to align this, if you have the will and courage to be bru­tally hon­est with your­self and learn to ac­cept the con­straints of your life.</p>
    <p>Recog­nise your unique gifts, skills and tal­ents so you can align those with your val­ues and use them to con­trib­ute to some­thing larger than your­self. It doesn’t have to be huge acts – even the small­est daily act, in the ser­vice of oth­ers, can be trans­for­ma­tive.</p>
    <p>Learn to learn again. Fo­cus on your emo­tional health and ac­quire the skills to cope with neg­a­tive emo­tional en­ergy. And take care of your phys­i­cal health. A healthy body is a healthy mind. By the end of my year off, I was in the best phys­i­cal shape of my life and was full of op­ti­mism, en­ergy, cre­ativ­ity and ideas.</p>
    <p>Why do marginalis­ed women and youth at risk hold such spe­cial places in your heart?</p>
    <p>Women hold up more than half the world and are still mas­sively marginalis­ed and dis­crim­i­nated against in so many ar­eas of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Many stud­ies have shown that im­prov­ing women’s lives lead to bet­ter out­comes for their fam­i­lies, their com­mu­ni­ties, so­ci­ety and economies glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Women also have tremen­dous emo­tional power and we of­ten use this in neg­a­tive ways that hurt rather than help us. I know this be­cause I was like this.</p>
    <p>Youth at risk rep­re­sent our fu­ture and are mal­leable enough to change. Many young peo­ple are in cir­cum­stances not of their own mak­ing and are stuck in vi­cious cir­cles of marginal­i­sa­tion, in­equal­ity, poverty and vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>We can’t change and help ev­ery­body, but ev­ery time I am strug­gling to make sense of why we con­tinue to do this very chal­leng­ing work, I get clearly re­minded by the progress I see in just one stu­dent.</p>
    <p>Do you be­lieve there is a rea­son for ev­ery­thing?</p>
    <p>Ab­so­lutely. I al­ways tell peo­ple I couldn’t have done this any ear­lier in my life.</p>
    <p>The sum of all my ex­pe­ri­ences al­lows me to do what I do to­day. Ev­ery mis­take, fail­ure and dis­ap­point­ment was to teach me things I didn’t al­ready know, change my mind about some­thing I thought I had de­cided on and show me how some­thing could be done dif­fer­ently for a bet­ter out­come.</p>
    <p>So, it’s al­ways about look­ing for the les­son and con­nect­ing sig­nals to pat­terns. If neg­a­tive pat­terns keep emerg­ing, then it’s a clear sig­nal we haven’t learnt our les­son.</p>
    <p>I have found that as long as the in­tent is pure and eth­i­cally right, the uni­verse some­how opens the path for you when you are ready to walk it.</p>
    <p>What does pur­pose mean to you?</p>
    <p>Bring­ing the best, most authen­tic ver­sion of your­self to your life at ev­ery mo­ment, pre­sent­ing your unique gifts to the world so they can pos­i­tively im­pact the peo­ple around you and, ul­ti­mately, the ecosys­tems you op­er­ate in.</p>
    <p>I am so grate­ful to be work­ing with a com­mit­ted and pur­posedriven team, liv­ing my life’s pur­pose ev­ery day through the Bettr world.</p>
