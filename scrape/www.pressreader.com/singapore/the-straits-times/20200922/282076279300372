    <p>Es­sen­tial work­ers in the en­ergy, wa­ter, waste and en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices will each re­ceive $200 in cash as Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries’ show of ap­pre­ci­a­tion to those the com­pany says have kept Sin­ga­pore run­ning amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>To do this, Sem­b­corp is part­ner­ing the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) to dis­burse $500,000 in to­tal to ap­prox­i­mately 2,500 el­i­gi­ble union mem­bers.</p>
    <p>This is part of an ini­tial in­jec­tion of $1.5 mil­lion to pro­vide re­lief to mi­grant work­ers and char­i­ties, as well as to show ap­pre­ci­a­tion for es­sen­tial work­ers.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day to an­nounce the launch of the Sem­b­corp En­ergy for Good Fund, the com­pany’s group pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive Wong Kim Yin said: “The fund will sup­port smaller char­i­ties with their util­i­ties ex­penses, to help de­fray their op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>“We also want to show our ap­pre­ci­a­tion to work­ers who have helped keep our na­tion run­ning smoothly.”</p>
    <p>In part­ner­ship with the Community Foun­da­tion of Sin­ga­pore (CFS), Sem­b­corp will pro­vide 35 char­i­ties with a $10,000 grant each, for a to­tal of $350,000.</p>
    <p>They have also sep­a­rately pro­vided $10 mo­bile phone SIM card top-ups to ap­prox­i­mately 20,000 mi­grant work­ers to help them stay con­nected with their loved ones back home.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said the fund will also match staff do­na­tions dol­lar­for-dol­lar, with a to­tal target of $100,000.</p>
    <p>This sum will go to­wards a CFS Sayang Sayang Fund, which was started in Fe­bru­ary to sup­port vul­ner­a­ble groups ad­versely im­pacted by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Wong: “As we de­liver es­sen­tial ser­vices, we also want to do good for our peo­ple and com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Ms Catherine Loh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of CFS, said: “Many char­i­ties are see­ing in­creased de­mand for their ser­vices and are work­ing tire­lessly to pro­vide as­sis­tance to a grow­ing num­ber of peo­ple com­ing for­ward to seek help.</p>
    <p>“We are glad to see the Sem­b­corp En­ergy for Good Fund lend a help­ing hand to char­i­ties – es­pe­cially when they need it the most.”</p>
