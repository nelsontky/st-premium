    <p>Iwas de­lighted when the cruises to nowhere started. I’d booked a two-night cruise leav­ing on Nov 6, then a three-night cruise leav­ing on Nov 15. Tak­ing the Covid-19 test for the first cruise was chaotic, but it was un­der­stand­able as the staff were not fully pre­pared for the crowds. The food and ser­vice were bad and not at all or­gan­ised. Again, this was un­der­stand­able as it had been many months since the ships had sailed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, my fam­ily and I were put off by the cruise am­bas­sadors, who were rude and ar­ro­gant in en­forc­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>On the sec­ond cruise, ev­ery­thing was very well-or­gan­ised. The food and the ser­vice were great. We were very happy un­til we en­coun­tered the rude am­bas­sadors again.</p>
    <p>They hung around, chat­ting in groups, of­ten not ob­serv­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules them­selves. Yet they were overzeal­ous in point­ing out to trav­ellers to keep to safe dis­tanc­ing rules. On a few oc­ca­sions, some am­bas­sadors rudely re­minded my fam­ily mem­bers and me to stay 1m apart from one an­other, even when we were al­ready do­ing so.</p>
    <p>Their brusque man­ner to­tally ru­ined our en­joy­ment.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest Dream Cruises make sure these am­bas­sadors are prop­erly trained to ex­er­cise more diplo­macy.</p>
    <p>Not all the am­bas­sadors were bad though. We en­coun­tered very po­lite ones whom I be­lieve were from the travel in­dus­try, and who made re­ally good am­bas­sadors.</p>

    <p>I sug­gest Dream Cruises make sure these am­bas­sadors are prop­erly trained to ex­er­cise more diplo­macy.</p>
