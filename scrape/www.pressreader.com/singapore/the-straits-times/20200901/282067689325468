    <p>The 2014 Shangri-La Di­a­logue saw Mr Shinzo Abe, Ja­pan’s Prime Min­is­ter, mak­ing his mark. Then, ex­pec­ta­tions were high that he would ad­dress China’s mar­itime ad­ven­tur­ism in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>He did not dis­ap­point. In his key­note speech, Mr Abe made clear that dis­putant states must ad­here to three over­ar­ch­ing prin­ci­ples with re­gard to the “rule of law at sea”: ad­her­ence to in­ter­na­tional law, re­straint in the use of co­er­cion and/or force, and set­tling ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes peace­fully.</p>
    <p>The man with the wavy coif­fure surely made waves. The prin­ci­ples laid the foun­da­tion of what Mr Abe would later trot out as his</p>
    <p>Indo-Pa­cific con­cept that has gained much cur­rency since.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Mr Abe’s Ja­pan ex­erted a pow­er­ful re­gional lead­er­ship role, at a time when United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s trans­ac­tional ap­proach to trade and geopo­lit­i­cal com­pe­ti­tion alien­ated al­lies and part­ners. As Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity’s Pro­fes­sor Rory Med­calf notes in his ex­pan­sive work, Indo-Pa­cific Em­pire, Mr Abe had a grand vi­sion of seek­ing to out­flank Chi­nese power by ven­tur­ing into the In­dian Ocean, us­ing a mod­ern mil­i­tary in sup­port of the US al­liance, a “novel part­ner­ship” with In­dia and a “quasi al­liance” with Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>It was South-east Asia, in par­tic­u­lar, that ben­e­fited the most un­der the Ja­panese leader. Mr Abe’s Ja­pan lived up to for­mer premier Takeo Fukuda’s 1977 dec­la­ra­tion that Ja­pan would pur­sue an equal re­la­tion­ship with the coun­tries of South-east Asia. To­day, Ja­pan is Asean’s big­gest source of for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment and its sec­ond-big­gest trad­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>It was Mr Abe, through his sheer force of will and skil­ful manoeuvrin­g, that helped steer 11 coun­tries – in­clud­ing Brunei, Malaysia, Sin­ga­pore and Viet­nam – into the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship af­ter Mr Trump’s uni­lat­eral with­drawal from the 12-na­tion Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>And while much has been said about China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI), it is Ja­pan that has in­vested more into re­gional con­nec­tiv­ity projects. The value of Ja­pan-fi­nanced projects in six of Asean’s big­gest economies – In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Sin­ga­pore, Thai­land and Viet­nam – to­tal US$367 bil­lion (S$500 bil­lion), against China’s US$255 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Abe, Ja­pan broke free from its post-war paci­fist stric­tures on the pro­jec­tion of mil­i­tary force, this largely done through a his­toric in­ter­pre­ta­tion of Ar­ti­cle 9 of its Con­sti­tu­tion. This net­ted quick div­i­dends for Asean, which fret­ted about Chi­nese co­er­cion in the dis­puted South China Sea. In re­cent years, Ja­pan has sent its Izumo-class he­li­copter car­ri­ers to South-east Asia, and even far­ther into the In­dian Ocean, to train with friendly navies and send de­ter­rent sig­nals to Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese are dead se­ri­ous about push­ing back against Chi­nese co­er­cion. In 2018, I was asked point­edly by a Ja­panese diplo­mat as to whether South-east Asian coun­tries would be com­fort­able with the idea of Ja­panese flat-tops be­ing sent to the re­gion with F-35 stealth fight­ers on board.</p>
    <p>But the crown­ing achieve­ment of Mr Abe’s premiershi­p is the Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific (FOIP) strat­egy. Yes, it was Pres­i­dent Trump who touted the term at an Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic</p>
    <p>Cooperatio­n sum­mit in 2017, but it was Mr Abe who had laid down the foun­da­tions of the strat­egy 10 years prior. Speak­ing to the In­dian Par­lia­ment in 2007, he ar­gued that Tokyo and New Delhi had the abil­ity and re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­able “broader Asia” to be­come “seas of great­est trans­parence”.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy has gen­er­ated much pub­lic in­ter­est, with Can­berra and Washington join­ing New Delhi and Tokyo on the FOIP band­wagon. Even Asean has sought to put its own im­pri­matur on Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy (though the group­ing wants it to be less exclusive and seeks to avoid any at­tempt to con­strain China).</p>
    <p>Still, the FOIP strat­egy has legs to run, par­tic­u­larly af­ter In­dia’s re­cent bor­der clash with China in June.</p>
    <p>New Delhi is reportedly poised to in­vite Aus­tralia to its Mal­abar se­ries of mar­itime ex­er­cises, which cur­rently in­volve In­dia, Ja­pan and the US.</p>
    <p>This is not to say that all Mr Abe touched turned to gold. At home, his much-vaunted Abe­nomics has had a mixed record of re­viv­ing the econ­omy. Far­ther afield, his right-wing in­cli­na­tions have been viewed with some sus­pi­cion.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, who­ever turns out to be Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sor will have his work cut out. No one can quite repli­cate his vi­sion and verve.</p>
    <p>One big ques­tion would be how Tokyo man­ages its re­la­tions with China. For Mr Abe, it was never a ques­tion of hew­ing to the Trump model of a full-court press on</p>
    <p>China, or Asean’s rel­a­tive pas­siv­ity when it came to chal­leng­ing Bei­jing’s as­sertive­ness.</p>
    <p>While Ja­pan has dis­putes with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea, Mr Abe has also sought to work with China to pi­o­neer re­gional con­nec­tiv­ity projects and steady his re­la­tion­ship with Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping. This is clas­sic Al Pa­cino of The God­fa­ther fame: keep­ing friends close and en­e­mies closer.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sor would also need to nav­i­gate the tricky re­la­tion­ship with the US, at a time when there are grave anx­i­eties in the re­gion about Mr Trump’s trans­ac­tion­al­ism, as dis­played to­wards Ja­pan and South Korea. No won­der Pro­fes­sor Yuichi Hosoya, a Ja­panese scholar, has called for a re­think of Ja­pan’s over-re­liance on the al­liance, and build up the coun­try’s de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Lastly, Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sor would need to keep Ja­pan in the game of win­ning friends and in­flu­enc­ing peo­ple in Asean. Malaysia, the Philip­pines and Viet­nam have be­come more vo­cal about us­ing the aegis of in­ter­na­tional law to chal­lenge China in the South China Sea; Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sor can­not af­ford to drop the ball on this if Ja­pan is to main­tain its net­work of like-minded part­ners.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan would also need to pitch its En­hanced Part­ner­ship for Qual­ity In­fra­struc­ture, which fo­cuses on is­sues such as ef­fec­tive gov­er­nance, job cre­ation and ad­dress­ing so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pacts, to South-east Asia, at a time when there are con­cerns about China’s BRI and “debt trap diplo­macy”.</p>
    <p>In the 2020 State of South­east Asia Sur­vey pub­lished by the ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute, 61 per cent of re­spon­dents rated Ja­pan as the most trusted ma­jor power (against the US’ 30 per cent and China’s 16 per cent). Mr Abe has built up a deep well of good­will. His suc­ces­sor will do well not to squan­der it.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, who­ever turns out to be Mr Shinzo Abe’s suc­ces­sor will have his work cut out. No one can quite repli­cate his vi­sion and verve.</p>
    <p>One big ques­tion would be how Tokyo man­ages its re­la­tions with China. For Mr Abe, it was never a ques­tion of hew­ing to the Trump model of a full-court press on China, or Asean’s rel­a­tive pas­siv­ity when it came to chal­leng­ing Bei­jing’s as­sertive­ness.</p>
