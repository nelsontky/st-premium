    <p>IN­JURY RISK</p>
    <p>MEL­BOURNE • The Aus­tralian Open will likely be pushed back by one to two weeks, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day, as talks con­tinue over stag­ing the tour­na­ment in Mel­bourne, which has only re­cently emerged from months of coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>A de­lay for the first ten­nis Grand Slam of the year, sched­uled to be­gin on Jan 18, was now “most likely”, ad­mit­ted the Vic­to­ria state gov­ern­ment’s Sports Min­is­ter Martin Pakula.</p>
    <p>“I still think it’s much more likely that it will be a shorter rather than longer de­lay,” he said.</p>
    <p>The “very com­plex ne­go­ti­a­tions” are still un­der way but he re­mained con­fi­dent the event would go ahead in the early part of next year, which would be prefer­able to sug­ges­tions in the Her­ald Sun’s re­port it may be moved to March.</p>
    <p>For eight months, Aus­tralia has been vir­tu­ally closed off from the rest of the world, with a blan­ket ban on non-res­i­dents en­ter­ing the coun­try and cit­i­zens strongly ad­vised against for­eign travel.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Open chief Craig Ti­ley had orig­i­nally wanted play­ers to start ar­riv­ing in the coun­try from mid-De­cem­ber so they could un­dergo a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine be­fore play­ing tra­di­tional warm-up events.</p>
    <p>But the plan has been thrown into doubt by Vic­to­rian Pre­mier Daniel An­drews. He re­port­edly will not al­low play­ers to ar­rive be­fore Jan­uary, which would make it all but im­pos­si­ble to hold the high­pro­file ATP Cup and other tour­na­ments be­fore the start of the Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>Ten­nis Aus­tralia, how­ever, is still plan­ning to shift all build-up tour­na­ments lead­ing to the Grand Slam to Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>Also un­der dis­cus­sion is whether play­ers will be able to train or com­pete dur­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Re­cently-crowned ATP Fi­nals cham­pion Daniil Medvedev feels be­ing able to prac­tise is crit­i­cal for the hard-court Ma­jor to take place.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to go to Aus­tralia when we can to avoid any cir­cum­stances that would change your mind about com­pet­ing there,” the world No. 4, fresh off the big­gest win of his ca­reer in Lon­don last Sun­day, told CNN.</p>
    <p>“If, for in­stance, you weren’t able to com­pete or to train dur­ing quar­an­tine just ahead of the tour­na­ment, I don’t think the tour­na­ment is go­ing to hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian added it would be “dan­ger­ous” for play­ers to be con­fined to a ho­tel room for two weeks af­ter ar­riv­ing in Aus­tralia and then go straight into a Slam.</p>
    <p>“(I’m) not com­plain­ing that it’s bor­ing or some­thing like this,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s just that go­ing out from the room af­ter 14 days of not do­ing any­thing and (then) play­ing five sets right away, I think would be re­ally dan­ger­ous for the health of any sports­man.</p>
    <p>“At least from what was said be­fore, we would be able to prac­tise on ten­nis courts and prac­tise phys­i­cally, which is re­ally im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it’s go­ing to be pos­si­ble for any­body to go there (if they) will need to stay in the room for 14 days.”</p>
    <p>Play­ers and their sup­port staff at the US and French Opens were not re­quired to quar­an­tine for 14 days upon ar­rival but the Vic­to­ria gov­ern­ment will not make any ex­cep­tion, even for elite ath­letes.</p>
    <p>The Open has not been held out­side of Jan­uary since 1987.</p>
    <p>It’s just that go­ing out from the room af­ter 14 days of not do­ing any­thing and (then) play­ing five sets right away, I think would be re­ally dan­ger­ous for the health of any sports­man.</p>
