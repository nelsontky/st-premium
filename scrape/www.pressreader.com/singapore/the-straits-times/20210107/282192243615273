    <p>AMOUNT ALIBABA PLANS TO RAISE THROUGH BOND SALE THIS MONTH |</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • China’s Alibaba Group Hold­ing plans to raise at least US$5 bil­lion ($6.6 bil­lion) through the sale of a US dol­lar-de­nom­i­nated bond this month, four peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter said, amid reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny of co-founder Jack Ma’s em­pire.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on in­vestor re­sponse, pro­ceeds could reach US$8 bil­lion which the e-com­merce leader is likely to use for gen­eral cor­po­rate ex­pen­di­ture, one of the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>The fundrais­ing will be a test of in­vestor sen­ti­ment to­wards Alibaba, com­ing months af­ter an Oc­to­ber speech by Mr Ma about reg­u­la­tion sti­fling in­no­va­tion that led to the halt­ing of af­fil­i­ate Ant Group’s US$37 bil­lion list­ing. Mr Ma’s ab­sence from pub­lic view since has fu­elled so­cial me­dia spec­u­la­tion over his where­abouts.</p>
    <p>The bond sale plan, in­clud­ing time­line, is not fi­nalised and is sub­ject to change, the peo­ple said, all of whom de­clined to be iden­ti­fied as they were not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia. Alibaba de­clined to com­ment. Since Mr Ma’s speech, Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors have be­gun an an­titrust probe into Alibaba and or­dered fin­tech firm Ant to change its lend­ing and other con­sumer fi­nance busi­nesses, in­clud­ing the cre­ation of a hold­ing com­pany to meet cap­i­tal re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has also ratch­eted up ten­sions, mov­ing to ban trans­ac­tions with eight Chi­nese soft­ware ap­pli­ca­tions, in­clud­ing Ant Group’s Ali­pay mo­bile pay­ment app.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors are also re­view­ing Ant’s equity in­vest­ments i n dozens of com­pa­nies and con­sid­er­ing whether to in­struct the firm to di­vest some, Reuters re­ported last month.</p>
    <p>Alibaba’s in­ter­na­tional bond of­fer­ing, if fi­nalised, would be the group’s third, Refini­tiv data showed. It sold an US$8 bil­lion bond in 2014, and a US$7 bil­lion tranche in 2017, the data showed.</p>
    <p>With its lat­est planned float, Alibaba will join a slew of Asian com­pa­nies that i n re­cent months have taken ad­van­tage of cheaper bor­row­ing costs and abun­dant liq­uid­ity in global mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The terms of the of­fer­ing were not yet known. Two of the peo­ple said mar­ket­ing doc­u­ments were likely to be available as soon as next week, and that the ten­ure is likely to be 10 years.</p>
