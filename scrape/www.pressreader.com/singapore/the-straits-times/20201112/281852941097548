    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land’s King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn wrote mes­sages of na­tional unity and love on Tues­day dur­ing a visit to the north-east of the coun­try two days af­ter pro­test­ers sent him a let­ter de­mand­ing royal re­forms that would curb his pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace has made no com­ment on months of protests, so any com­mu­ni­ca­tions from the King are watched care­fully in the South-east Asian coun­try.</p>
    <p>“We all love and care for each other. Take care of the coun­try, help each other pro­tect our coun­try with good­ness for pros­per­ity and pro­tect Thai­ness,” the King wrote in a mes­sage to the gov­er­nor of Udon Thani prov­ince.</p>
    <p>On a pic­ture of him­self and Queen Suthida that was brought by one of many well-wish­ers, the King wrote: “Love the na­tion, love the peo­ple, cher­ish Thai­ness, real hap­pi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of pro­test­ers marched to the Grand Palace in Bangkok on Sun­day, get­ting within a few dozen me­tres of the walls de­spite a po­lice blockade and a burst of wa­ter can­non, to send a mes­sage to the King.</p>
    <p>Shat­ter­ing a long­stand­ing taboo on crit­i­cis­ing the monar­chy, they have de­manded the de­par­ture of for­mer junta leader Prayut Chano-cha as prime min­is­ter, a new Con­sti­tu­tion and re­forms that would re­duce the King’s pow­ers.</p>
    <p>“When the King truly cher­ishes democ­racy, all peo­ple will find hap­pi­ness,” the pro­test­ers said.</p>
    <p>The King made his first com­ments on the pro­test­ers last week in which he said “we love them all the same” and de­scrib­ing Thai­land as a land of com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has said he will not re­sign, rejecting pro­test­ers’ ac­cu­sa­tions that he en­gi­neered last year’s elec­tion to keep power that</p>
    <p>he seized in a 2014 coup.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures from dif­fer­ent royal events in Udon Thani showed thou­sands of peo­ple. Many wore yel­low shirts – match­ing the King’s colour – and car­ried of­fi­cial por­traits of the royal cou­ple.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Ger­man gov­ern</p>
    <p>ment found no ev­i­dence that the Thai King did any­thing il­le­gal while re­sid­ing there, Ger­man press agency DPA said on Tues­day, cit­ing a For­eign Min­istry state­ment.</p>
    <p>The King has spent most of his time over the past years in the Euro­pean na­tion, and Thai protest</p>
    <p>ers last month asked Ger­many to probe if he had ex­er­cised royal au­thor­ity dur­ing his time there in vi­o­la­tion of the coun­try’s law.</p>
    <p>“The Ger­man gov­ern­ment has no re­li­able ev­i­dence that the Thai King has taken any such de­ci­sions dur­ing his stay in Ger­many,” the</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>It added that it ex­pected the King not to make de­ci­sions that “con­tra­vene the Ger­man le­gal sys­tem, in­ter­na­tional law or in­ter­na­tion­ally guar­an­teed hu­man rights” while on Ger­man soil.</p>
