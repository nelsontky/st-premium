    <p>ADDIS ABABA • Two air­ports in Ethiopia’s Amhara state which neigh­bours Tigray where fed­eral troops are fight­ing lo­cal forces have been tar­geted by rocket fire, the gov­ern­ment said, as an 11-day con­flict widened.</p>
    <p>The air­port i n Gon­dar i n Amhara state, which neigh­bours Tigray, was hit on Friday, while an­other rocket aimed at the Bahir Dar air­port missed the tar­get, the gov­ern­ment said.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Tigray party, the Tigray Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Front (TPLF), said the Tigray De­fence Forces con­ducted mis­sile strikes in mil­i­tary bases in Bahir Dar and Gon­dar i n re­tal­i­a­tion for air strikes con­ducted by Prime Min­is­ter Abiy Ahmed’s forces in var­i­ous parts of the state.</p>
    <p>“As long as the at­tacks on the peo­ple of Tigray do not stop, the at­tacks will in­ten­sify,” Mr Ge­tachew Reda, a spokesman for the TPLF, said in a state­ment on the Face­book page of the Tigray state’s com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Ge­tachew also threat­ened to strike neigh­bour­ing Eritrea by launch­ing “mis­sile at­tacks to foil mil­i­tary move­ments in Mas­sawa and As­mara”, re­fer­ring to cities in Eritrea.</p>
    <p>The war has al­ready killed hun­dreds, pushed thou­sands of civil­ians into neigh­bour­ing Su­dan, and raised fears it may draw in Eritrea or pres­sure Ethiopia’s com­mit­ment to an African force op­pos­ing Al-Qaeda-linked mil­i­tants in So­ma­lia.</p>
    <p>It may also blem­ish the rep­u­ta­tion of Mr Abiy, who won a No­bel Peace Prize for a 2018 peace pact with Eritrea and had won plau­dits for open­ing Ethiopia’s econ­omy and eas­ing a re­pres­sive po­lit­i­cal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Tigray’s leader, Mr De­bret­sion Ge­bremichael, said last Tues­day that Eritrea had sent troops across the bor­der in sup­port of Ethiopian gov­ern­ment forces, but this was de­nied by Eritrea.</p>
    <p>TOKYO • China’s For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi may visit Ja­pan later this month to meet his Ja­panese coun­ter­part Toshim­itsu Motegi for talks on co­op­er­a­tion over the coro­n­avirus cri­sis and the East China Sea sit­u­a­tion, the Mainichi news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang may also make a cour­tesy visit to Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, the re­port said yes­ter­day, cit­ing sev­eral Ja­panese gov­ern­ment sources.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter’s Ja­pan visit will likely take place after a video con­fer­ence of the lead­ers of the Asi­aPa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion group on Nov 20 and Group of 20 lead­ers’ vir­tual sum­mit meet­ing from Nov 21 to 22, the pa­per said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang’s up­com­ing visit fol­lows a phone call be­tween Mr Suga and Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping in Septem­ber in which the lead­ers agreed to have more high-level con­tacts to pro­mote re­gional and in­ter­na­tional sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>A planned state visit by Mr Xi to Ja­pan ear­lier this year was can­celled be­cause of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>There is a small pos­si­bil­ity that the two na­tions will dis­cuss de­tails of reschedul­ing Mr Xi’s Ja­pan visit dur­ing Mr Wang’s stay in Tokyo, ac­cord­ing to Mainichi.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, who be­came prime min­is­ter in Septem­ber, must man­age re­la­tions with Ja­pan’s big­ger neigh­bour as ties be­tween China and the United States worsen amid the coro­n­avirus pandemic and lin­ger­ing trade fric­tion.</p>
    <p>Tokyo, which is also in a dis­pute with Beijing over own­er­ship of is­lands in the East China Sea, has ex­pressed con­cern about an uptick in Chi­nese mil­i­tary ac­tiv­ity in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has as­sured Mr Suga that the se­cu­rity treaty be­tween the two coun­tries cov­ers the East China Sea is­lands.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga told re­porters in Ja­pan that the com­mit­ment came in a phone call be­tween the two lead­ers on Thurs­day morn­ing, dur­ing which they agreed to meet as soon as pos­si­ble and to work to­gether on a range of is­sues, in­clud­ing the han­dling of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan seeks as­sur­ances on the scope of the se­cu­rity treaty ev­ery time the US picks a new leader.</p>
