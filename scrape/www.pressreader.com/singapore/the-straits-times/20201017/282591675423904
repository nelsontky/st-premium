    <p>Lo­cal mo­tor sports per­son­al­ity Les­lie Chang may have spent most of his life sur­rounded by howl­ing race cars, but his ev­ery­day ride is al­most silent.</p>
    <p>The gre­gar­i­ous owner of a watch dis­trib­u­tor­ship drives a Hyundai Ioniq Elec­tric, which he bought in Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>In July this year, he took de­liv­ery of a Hyundai Kona Elec­tric. He shares this car with his wife, who helps in the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, both 57, have two daugh­ters aged 32 and 22, and a 30-year-old son.</p>
    <p>Mr Chang has been in­volved with mo­tor sports for most of his life and loved cars since he was a boy.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t shy to ask adults ques­tions re­lated to cars and driv­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>“As soon as I turned 17, I got my li­cence and, shortly af­ter that, I was heel-and-toe­ing and ex­e­cut­ing hand­brake turns,” he adds, re­fer­ring to com­mon rac­ing tech­niques.</p>
    <p>He made his foray into mo­tor sports at age 18, in pre­ci­sion driv­ing events called au­totests. “I was called Small Boy by the oth­ers,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>The “small boy” soon wowed with his skills and grew in stature in the mo­tor sports com­mu­nity. He served two stints as pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Mo­tor Sports As­so­ci­a­tion (now known as Mo­tor Sports Sin­ga­pore) – from 1996 to 1997 and 2014 to 2016 – and re­mains a com­mit­tee mem­ber of the as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Over the decades, Mr Chang has clinched nu­mer­ous ti­tles.</p>
    <p>One of his most mem­o­rable was the SMSA Su­per­grade Cham­pi­onship in 1994, where he won mul­ti­ple events over the course of the year. The feats were ac­com­plished while he was also run­ning two busi­nesses – his watch busi­ness and a pub, which meant knock­ing off at al­most 3am be­fore the races on Sun­day morn­ings.</p>
    <p>Another achieve­ment was rac­ing in the 2005 12-hour Merdeka Mil­len­nium En­durance race at Sepang, where he as­ton­ished time­keep­ers with his speed and con­sis­tency, fre­quently set­ting mul­ti­ple con­sec­u­tive lap times within a sec­ond of each other.</p>
    <p>Mr Chang’s road cars through the years have ranged from a Suzuki SS40 – which he cred­its as “the lit­tle car I started mo­tor sports with” – to a Re­nault Es­pace, Citroen Xan­tia, Mitsubishi i and Subaru XV.</p>
    <p>None of them has been es­pe­cially fast or pow­er­ful be­cause Mr Chang prefers to seek his thrills on the track and not pub­lic roads.</p>
    <p>He says he switched to elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs) be­cause they are “so smooth, quiet and ef­fort­less – ideal for city driv­ing”.</p>
    <p>Also, when the car is idling, “I no longer feel bad about the heat, smell or noise that may an­noy peo­ple nearby”, he adds.</p>
    <p>As he has a wall-mounted charger at his work­place, he charges both his EVs there – the Ioniq ev­ery other day and the Kona about once ev­ery five days.</p>
    <p>While EVs gen­er­ally cost more to buy but less to run, Mr Chang’s an­nual mileage is not high enough to re­alise sig­nif­i­cant sav­ings. He reck­ons that if he keeps each car for 10 years, “it’s a zero-sum game, no sav­ings nor penal­ties”.</p>
    <p>He adds that he picked Hyundai be­cause of the “ex­cel­lent qual­ity of its cur­rent of­fer­ings” as well as the “great value” that it rep­re­sents.</p>
    <p>He also has a close re­la­tion­ship with lo­cal Hyundai agent Ko­moco Motors, which spon­sored Mr Chang on two over­land driv­ing ex­pe­di­tions to and from China with two sport util­ity ve­hi­cles – a Hyundai Tuc­son and Hyundai Santa Fe.</p>
    <p>He has another rea­son for go­ing elec­tric.</p>
    <p>“Age is catch­ing up,” he says. “So although I still en­joy speed, I dis­like the noise that comes with it.</p>
    <p>“With EVs, I get the best of both worlds – they are quick and quiet.”</p>
    <p>What’s in the boot?</p>
