    <p>ZURICH • Swatch Group cut about 2,400 jobs, its big­gest cull in at least three decades, to trim its store net­work as the Swiss watch­maker be­came un­prof­itable for the first time.</p>
    <p>The maker of Omega and Longines time­pieces said yes­ter­day that it ac­cel­er­ated plans to shut stores defini­tively in Hong Kong, as well as shops that sell its colour­ful name­sake brand and Calvin Klein watches.</p>
    <p>The com­pany re­ported its first loss as sales in the six months in­clud­ing June plum­meted 43 per cent.</p>
    <p>In a break with its strat­egy dur­ing pre­vi­ous crises such as the 2009 fi­nan­cial down­turn, Swatch is lean­ing more on slash­ing jobs, a sig­nal that this year is dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Nick Hayek has said that dur­ing hard times, the prob­lem with cut­ting jobs is that it is dif­fi­cult to find qual­i­fied staff when the mar­ket re­bounds.</p>
    <p>“Win­ston Churchill said ‘ never waste a good cri­sis’, and that’s ex­actly what we’re go­ing to do, es­pe­cially in the sec­ond half of the year,” Mr Hayek said in pre­pared video re­marks.</p>
    <p>The stock was lit­tle changed in early trad­ing, hav­ing dropped 28 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Hayek said Swatch ex­pects a profit this year as coun­tries ease lockdown mea­sures that had led to shut­tered shops and travel bans amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s first-half op­er­at­ing loss of 327 mil­lion Swiss francs (S$484.6 mil­lion) was twice as big as an­a­lysts ex­pected.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond half, Swatch plans to in­tro­duce new prod­ucts, in­clud­ing a Tis­sot smart­watch.</p>
    <p>Swatch an­nounced the end of its 22-year-old con­tract to sell Calvin Klein watches in Oc­to­ber, and many of the clo­sures were re­lated to that de­ci­sion, Mr Hayek said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s plas­tic name­sake brand is also re­duc­ing its reliance on bricks-and-mor­tar stores and will rely more on e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>Swatch fore­cast that the in­dus­try will re­cover quickly as con­sumers catch up on shop­ping af­ter lock­downs, as seen in China and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Last month was al­ready prof­itable, thanks to pent-up de­mand in main­land China, where sales rose at a dou­ble-digit rate in May and June.</p>
    <p>Still, only about half of the com­pany’s employees in Switzer­land have re­turned to work full time.</p>
    <p>About 6,000 employees were on short-time work last week, while about 2,500 were tak­ing un­used va­ca­tion time or re­duc­ing over­time, ac­cord­ing to chief con­trol­ling of­fi­cer Peter Steiger.</p>
    <p>The com­pany had to close up to 80 per cent of its sales out­lets around the world dur­ing lock­downs. It closed 260 stores defini­tively and now has about 1,800.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A closed Swatch shop in Zurich in April, dur&#xAD;ing the lockdown to help pre&#xAD;vent the spread of the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus that causes Covid-19. The Swiss watch man&#xAD;u&#xAD;fac&#xAD;turer had to shut up to 80 per cent of its sales out&#xAD;lets around the world dur&#xAD;ing lock&#xAD;downs, and it re&#xAD;ported its first loss as sales in the first half of this year plum&#xAD;meted 43 per cent.</p>
