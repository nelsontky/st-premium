    <p>The Euro­pean Union (EU) is warn­ing gov­ern­ments not to shorten the 14-day quar­an­tine pe­riod for Covid-19 pa­tients as some de­velop the in­fec­tion even af­ter two weeks, the head of the bloc’s health agency said, sig­nalling a new surge in cases in Europe.</p>
    <p>Ger­many, the bloc’s largest coun­try, had ear­lier in­formed the EU au­thor­i­ties that it planned to shorten the quar­an­tine length, fol­low­ing sim­i­lar moves by the Nether­lands and Nor­way, ac­cord­ing to min­utes of a meet­ing held late last month.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing to pro­vide some ev­i­dence to de­ci­sion mak­ers on what kind of risks they would take if quar­an­tine was shorter,” Dr An­drea Am­mon, head of the Euro­pean Centre for Dis­ease Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol (ECDC), told EU law­mak­ers on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>She cau­tioned that in 3 per cent to 4 per cent of Covid-19 cases, in­fec­tions emerge only af­ter 14 days, which is the stan­dard length of the coro­n­avirus quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Ger­many de­cided last week that from next month, peo­ple re­turn­ing from high-risk re­gions abroad will be quar­an­tined for just five days.</p>
    <p>The par­tial loos­en­ing of mea­sures comes as Europe ex­pe­ri­ences a new surge in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“The virus has not been sleep­ing over the sum­mer. It did not take a va­ca­tion,” Dr Am­mon told law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>She said this week’s data showed that across Europe, there were 46 cases for ev­ery 100,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“We are al­most back to num­bers that we have seen in March,” she said, re­fer­ring to the be­gin­ning of the peak phase in Europe.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions in Europe were around 40 per 100,000 peo­ple at the end of March, ac­cord­ing to data from the ECDC, and rose to around 70 per 100,000 by the end of April.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent in­crease in cases was due in part to more test­ing.</p>
    <p>The new cases con­cern largely younger peo­ple, Dr Am­mon said, a new pat­tern that had re­sulted in sta­ble hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion num­bers, as the ill­ness is more se­ri­ous for older peo­ple who were hit hard in March and April.</p>
    <p>But she added that hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions were now grow­ing again, sig­nalling spikes in cases among the el­derly.</p>
    <p>The data, which con­cerns the 27 EU coun­tries, Bri­tain, Nor­way, Ice­land and Liecht­en­stein, varies greatly be­tween states – from two to 176 per 100,000 peo­ple, Dr Am­mon said, with­out cit­ing spe­cific coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Bri­tish govern­ment said it is “anx­iously mon­i­tor­ing” in­creas­ing hospi­tal admissions in France and Spain, re­ported the Fi­nan­cial Times, with Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock con­cerned that other Euro­pean coun­tries’ out­breaks could her­ald a more se­ri­ous Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Bri­tain.</p>
