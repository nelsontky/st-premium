    <p>BENGALURU • Busi­ness sen­ti­ment among Asian firms re­bounded in the third quar­ter as eas­ing coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions lifted sales, but lin­ger­ing un­cer­tainty over the pan­demic thwarted a re­turn to busi­ness as usual, a Thom­son Reuters/Insead sur­vey showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Asian firms’ out­look for the next six months tracked by the Thom­son Reuters/Insead Asian Busi­ness Sen­ti­ment In­dex jumped to 53 in the third quar­ter from an 11-year low of 35 in the sec­ond, ac­cord­ing to the sur­vey of 103 com­pa­nies across 11 Asia-Pa­cific coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It was also higher than the 50-point mark, which in­di­cates a pos­i­tive out­look.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey comes as the eas­ing of coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions across Asia has re­duced pres­sure on hard-hit economies, though the ex­pe­ri­ence has var­ied across the re­gion, with some still in re­ces­sion and oth­ers, like China, see­ing a steady re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>More than two-thirds of the com­pa­nies polled said they saw the pan­demic, or a fresh spike in Covid-19 cases, as a top risk.</p>
    <p>About 14 per cent said a global re­ces­sion was their big­gest con­cern, while the rest flagged un­cer­tainty over the up­com­ing US election in Novem­ber and other risks.</p>
    <p>“We’re re­cov­er­ing with a large dose of un­cer­tainty,” said Pro­fes­sor An­to­nio Fatas, an eco­nomics don at global busi­ness school Insead in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“If it was just be­cause of Asia, I think the num­bers would be more pos­i­tive, but the re­al­ity is the world is not just Asia,” he said, point­ing to greater un­cer­tainty in Europe and the United States.</p>
    <p>The US has re­ported the great­est num­ber of Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties, while ris­ing num­bers in Europe are now threat­en­ing to shut down parts of the con­ti­nent again.</p>
    <p>Some 28 per cent of com­pa­nies in the third quar­ter were pos­i­tive about their out­look, the sur­vey showed, up sharply from 7.6 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>About 60 per cent of the firms polled said they did not hire or lay off peo­ple this quar­ter, in con­trast to the sec­ond quar­ter’s sur­vey in which 63 per cent said they had cut jobs.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies polled in­cluded Aus­tralia-listed Oil Search, In­dian mo­tor­cy­cle maker Hero Mo­toCorp and Ja­panese car­maker Suzuki Mo­tor.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey was con­ducted be­tween Aug 31 and Sept 14.</p>
    <p>While coun­tries in Asia have had mixed suc­cess in con­tain­ing the coro­n­avirus and its fall­out on their economies, the Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank ex­pects out­put in the re­gion to shrink for the first time in nearly six decades this year.</p>
    <p>China, where the coro­n­avirus was first de­tected, has largely man­aged to con­tain its spread, and South Korea and Ja­pan have kept case num­bers rel­a­tively low by global stan­dards de­spite all three coun­tries see­ing a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>But else­where in the re­gion, the out­break is wors­en­ing.</p>
    <p>In­dia, for in­stance, has re­ported the sec­ond-high­est num­ber of cases glob­ally.</p>
    <p>In­deed, some in­vestors are shun­ning Asia’s riskier, high-yield­ing mar­kets, de­spite the am­ple liq­uid­ity pumped into the fi­nan­cial sys­tem by cen­tral banks glob­ally this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Satish Shankar, the Asia-Pa­cific man­ag­ing part­ner of busi­ness con­sul­tancy Bain & Com­pany, said many com­pa­nies in the re­gion would “need to fun­da­men­tally trans­form their busi­ness mod­els” to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>But he added that Asia’s eco­nomic re­bound would be “strongly linked” to the re­cov­ery in the Chi­nese econ­omy.</p>
    <p>China ex­panded 3.2 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, and looks set to grow this year.</p>
    <p>Some China-based firms in the sur­vey said the up­com­ing US election was their pri­mary worry along­side Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The US government is threat­en­ing to delist Chi­nese com­pa­nies that do not meet US ac­count­ing stan­dards, while Washington has cracked down on Chi­nese tech firms amid wors­en­ing re­la­tions be­tween the world’s two largest economies.</p>
    <p>Mr Grant Pan, chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer of Chi­nese wealth man­ager Noah Hold­ings, which is listed in the US, said the firm was look­ing at “pos­si­ble al­ter­na­tives as a safety net, in­clud­ing the Hong Kong and Chi­nese cap­i­tal mar­kets”. Noah Hold­ings was among the com­pa­nies sur­veyed.</p>
