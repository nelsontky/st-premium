    <p>Ger­man giants Bayern Munich will be known as the new “In­vin­ci­bles” if they de­feat Paris Saint-Ger­main in Sun­day’s Champions League fi­nal. That was the nick­name given to the Ar­se­nal side that was un­beaten in the 2003-2004 English Premier League sea­son, with Bayern poised to em­u­late the feat this sea­son in Europe.</p>
    <p>LISBON • If Bayern Munich pre­vail in Sun­day’s Champions League fi­nal, there will be a new team of “In­vin­ci­bles”.</p>
    <p>That was the la­bel given to the Ar­se­nal side that went un­beaten in the 2003-04 English Premier League sea­son and the Bavar­ian giants are poised to em­u­late that feat in Europe. Just nine teams have won the Champions League with­out suf­fer­ing de­feat in their cam­paign, with the last be­ing Manch­ester United in 2007-08.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man Bun­desliga champions are un­de­feated this cal­en­dar year, win­ning 24 of their past 25 games in all com­pe­ti­tions and they have not lost in the Champions League all sea­son, scor­ing 42 goals and con­ced­ing just eight.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing al­ready picked up the do­mes­tic dou­ble, a sec­ond tre­ble after their first in 2013 is in Bayern’s sights. Barcelona are the only other Euro­pean club to have done the tre­ble twice, but stand­ing in the way of his­tory is Paris Saint-Ger­main.</p>
    <p>The French champions are aim­ing to go one bet­ter with an un­prece­dented quadru­ple, hav­ing al­ready swept all three do­mes­tic tro­phies this sea­son.</p>
    <p>With over €1 bil­lion (S$1.62 bil­lion) spent since the Qatari takeover in 2011 – only Manch­ester City have splurged more on play­ers – PSG’s ex­pen­sively-as­sem­bled squad are a match for Bayern.</p>
    <p>While Lyon fell to a 3-0 semi-fi­nal de­feat on Wed­nes­day, the French side showed how Bayern’s de­fence can be ex­posed, hit­ting the post via Karl Toko Ekambi among other missed first-half chances.</p>
    <p>But Bayern’s clin­i­cal fin­ish­ing through a brace from Serge Gnabry and Robert Le­wandowski’s 15th goal in this sea­son’s com­pe­ti­tion won the tie.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing after his side pro­gressed to their 11th Euro­pean Cup fi­nal and their first since 2013, Bay</p>
    <p>Paris have an at­tack with big names. There are al­ways a lot of goals with Bayern and PSG. Two great teams in this fi­nal, it will be a good game for the fans to watch. ’’ MANUEL NEUER, Bayern Munich goal­keeper, look­ing ahead to Sun­day.</p>
    <p>ern coach Hansi Flick wants his side to tighten up as PSG may be more pun­ish­ing in front of goal.</p>
    <p>“Lyon fought hard and made things hard for us. We know PSG have quick play­ers and we will have to or­gan­ise our de­fence dif­fer­ently,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Paris are a great team, they fought their way into the semi-fi­nal and then reached the fi­nal. We know they have quick play­ers, but our big­gest strength is putting our op­po­nents un­der pres­sure.”</p>
    <p>Bayern cap­tain Manuel Neuer, whose team claimed a record­e­qualling 10th straight win in Europe, be­lieves his de­fence will have their hands full against a star-stud­ded PSG at­tack boast­ing Ney­mar, Kylian Mbappe and An­gel di Maria.</p>
    <p>Both sides have played each other twice in re­cent sea­sons – they each scored three goals at home in wins dur­ing the group phase of the 2017-18 sea­son – and the Ger­many goal­keeper is ex­pect­ing a sim­i­lar open game.</p>
    <p>“Paris have an at­tack with big names. There are al­ways a lot of goals with Bayern and PSG,” Neuer said. “Two great teams in this fi­nal, it will be a good game for the fans to watch.</p>
    <p>“We are very happy to be in the fi­nal. The difference com­pared to the 2013 team is that the squad is larger. We won in 2013 with fewer play­ers. Now we have a fan­tas­tic group with a good at­mos­phere. There are no killjoys.”</p>
