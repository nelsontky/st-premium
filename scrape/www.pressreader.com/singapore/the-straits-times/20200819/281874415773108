    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s palm oil pro­duc­ers are em­bark­ing on a rare re­cruit­ment drive to hire lo­cals and ac­cel­er­at­ing in­dus­try mech­a­ni­sa­tion as they grap­ple with a se­vere short­age of for­eign labour due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As the Septem­ber-to-Novem­ber peak pro­duc­tion sea­son ap­proaches, com­pa­nies are erect­ing ban­ners near oil palm plan­ta­tions and post­ing on­line job ad­ver­tise­ments boast­ing free hous­ing, free wa­ter and other perks of es­tate life in a bid to at­tract work­ers to do every­thing from driv­ing trac­tors to har­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, travel and move­ment re­stric­tions have left the world’s sec­ond-largest palm oil pro­ducer grap­pling with a short­age of 37,000 work­ers, nearly 10 per cent of the to­tal work­force.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian Palm Oil As­so­ci­a­tion (MPOA) be­lieves this short­age could grow to 70,000 work­ers once bor­ders re­open.</p>
    <p>“This is the first time we are mak­ing such a big ef­fort to hire Malaysians, but it is also the first time we are fac­ing Covid-19,” Mr Im­ran, an es­tate man­ager with Sime Darby Plan­ta­tion, said after in­ter­view­ing po­ten­tial ap­pli­cants dur­ing a re­cruit­ment day near Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try fears the labour crunch will hurt palm oil pro­duc­tion this year by de­lay­ing the har­vest­ing of per­ish­able fruit, giv­ing an edge to big­ger ri­val In­done­sia, which has no such labour prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s av­er­age cost of pro­duc­tion is al­ready slightly higher at about US$406 (S$554) to US$480 a tonne, ac­cord­ing to an­a­lysts, com­pared with In­done­sia at US$400 to US$450 a tonne.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries like In­done­sia and Bangladesh pro­vide nearly 85 per cent of plan­ta­tion work­ers for palm oil com­pa­nies such as Sime Darby, IOI Corp and United Plan­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>While em­ploy­ing more Malaysians could save on re­cruit­ment fees and levies needed to fly in for­eign work­ers, planters worry that lo­cal work­ers, who typ­i­cally shun plan­ta­tion work as dirty and dan­ger­ous, will not com­mit to the in­dus­try or take on the most dif­fi­cult jobs.</p>
    <p>“It’s pos­si­ble that recruiting more lo­cals could bring down the cost of pro­duc­tion... pro­vided these lo­cals are also as pro­duc­tive as them (mi­grant work­ers),” said MPOA chief ex­ec­u­tive Nageeb Wa­hab. “That is a big ques­tion mark.”</p>
    <p>De­spite a ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment rate, Mr Im­ran said most of the in­ter­est at the re­cruit­ment day was for gen­eral du­ties, such as driver or me­chanic roles, rather than the tax­ing and cru­cial task of har­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>With more for­eign work­ers leav­ing, some se­verely un­der­staffed smaller com­pa­nies, which are less able to re­tain mi­grant labour, have re­sorted to poach­ing work­ers from com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>“It is bad, but I need to do this to sur­vive,” said an of­fi­cial of a mid­sized es­tate in Sarawak who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>The labour short­fall is adding ur­gency to long­stand­ing plans for in­dus­try mech­a­ni­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Sime Darby, the world’s big­gest palm oil com­pany by land size, said it is quick­en­ing devel­op­ment and tri­als to de­ploy light ma­chines that will aid in field up­keep, re­mov­ing har­vested crops and ap­ply­ing fer­tiliser.</p>
    <p>It is also turn­ing to re­mote sens­ing and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to drive pre­ci­sion farm­ing, mak­ing the most ef­fi­cient use of farm in­puts and field work­ers.</p>
    <p>IOI said it has a re­vi­talised mech­a­ni­sa­tion plan, and aims to mech­a­nise fer­til­is­ing and pes­ti­cide spray­ing as well as au­to­mate mill op­er­a­tions, while FGV Hold­ings plans to mech­a­nise an ex­tra 30,000ha over the next three years.</p>
    <p>Malaysia on av­er­age al­lots one worker for every 8ha, but the MPOA wants a “quan­tum leap” in tech­nol­ogy that would dou­ble the land area for each worker to 16ha. This would re­duce reliance on labour, which ac­counts for around 30 per cent of pro­duc­tion costs.</p>
