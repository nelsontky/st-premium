    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Con­stance Wu (left) had a baby in the sum­mer, but no one was any the wiser un­til now.</p>
    <p>The Crazy Rich Asians ac­tress, who also did not pub­licly re­veal her preg­nancy, had a baby girl with rocker boyfriend Ryan Kat­tner a few months ago, ac­cord­ing to E! News, which re­ported it yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is the first child for both of them.</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old ac­tress, who has not been ac­tive on social me­dia in re­cent months, has also not been seen in pub­lic since March, when the Covid-19 pan­demic shut down large swathes of the United States.</p>
    <p>While lit­tle has been re­vealed about the baby, not even a name, Wu may make a red-car­pet ap­pear­ance at the Sundance film fes­ti­val next month for her new film, I Was A Sim­ple Man. The ghost story set in the Hawai­ian coun­try­side is di­rected by Christo­pher Makoto Yogi.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Wu had wrapped her role as Jes­sica Huang on the sit­com Fresh Off The Boat. The show about a Tai­wanese-Amer­i­can fam­ily in Florida, which ran for six sea­sons, aired its final episode in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>While there is talk of a se­quel to the hit Crazy Rich Asians (2018), in which she played the lead Rachel Chu, her co-star Henry Gold­ing said that it has been de­layed.</p>
    <p>As for daddy Kat­tner, he also pro­duced a “baby” of his own in sum­mer.</p>
    <p>In May, the mu­si­cian-screen­writer, who fronts the band Man Man, dropped the band’s first al­bum in seven years, Dream Hunt­ing In The Val­ley Of The In-be­tweens.</p>
