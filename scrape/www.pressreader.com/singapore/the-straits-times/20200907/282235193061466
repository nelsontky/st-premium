    <p>Stock mar­kets have roared back to life since bot­tom­ing in March, but even with their stel­lar re­cov­ery, equities are no match for the best-per­form­ing ma­jor as­set of the year: gold.</p>
    <p>The yel­low metal is up 27 per cent this year, sharply out­per­form­ing key stock and fixed-in­come in­dexes like the S&P 500 (+11 per cent) and the Bloomberg Bar­clays Global Ag­gre­gate (+6.2 per cent).</p>
    <p>As a per­ceived safe haven, gold has thrived amid a his­toric global re­ces­sion. And as a non-yield-bear­ing as­set, it has ben­e­fited from the steep slide in real in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>Its com­mod­ity peer, crude oil, is hav­ing a much more tur­bu­lent year.</p>
    <p>Oil prices were crushed by a dou­ble whammy in March and April – a flood of sup­ply af­ter the break­down of the Opec+ (Or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Petroleum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries and its al­lies) pro­duc­tion-cut deal and the his­toric de­mand de­struc­tion from world­wide mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The prices have since re­cov­ered as lock­downs eased and pro­duc­tion plunged.</p>
    <p>With virus un­cer­tainty ebbing and pol­icy sup­port still flow­ing, the con­di­tions are ripe for com­mod­ity prices to keep ris­ing in the sec­ond half of this year and the next.</p>
    <p>The United States Fed­eral Re­serve, along with the world’s other cen­tral banks, has re­sponded to the eco­nomic car­nage wrought by the pan­demic and its as­so­ci­ated lock­downs with un­prece­dented liq­uid­ity in­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est rates are about as low as they can get – at near zero or be­low</p>
    <p>– across the de­vel­oped world.</p>
    <p>And the US and global economies are re­act­ing favourably to the out­pour­ing of pol­icy sup­port. Global eco­nomic data has beaten ex­pec­ta­tions in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer spend­ing has bounced back in de­vel­oped economies, spurred on by sav­ings dur­ing lock­down be­ing spent.</p>
    <p>The US labour mar­ket is im­prov­ing: Pay­rolls in­creased by</p>
    <p>1.8 mil­lion in July.</p>
    <p>And in China, pur­chas­ing man­agers’ in­dexes have been above 50 for four straight months.</p>
    <p>Fis­cal and mon­e­tary stim­u­lus mea­sures should pro­vide ad­di­tional fuel for the world’s economies in the sec­ond half of this year.</p>
    <p>The Fed, at its Jackson Hole sum­mit, moved fur­ther to for­malise a more dovish path by adopt­ing an av­er­age in­fla­tion-tar­get­ing frame­work and ar­tic­u­lat­ing a more in­clu­sive view on em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>This most likely means that the Fed funds rate could stay near zero for years to come, keep­ing real in­ter­est rates in neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>These con­di­tions should al­low the global econ­omy to steadily re­cover fur­ther, from a likely con­trac­tion of 4.1 per cent this year to an ex­pan­sion of 5.7 per cent next year, mark­ing a sig­nif­i­cant ac­cel­er­a­tion from the bot­tom in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>FER­TILE GROUND FOR COM­MODI­TIES</p>
    <p>Ac­cel­er­at­ing eco­nomic growth world­wide pro­vides ideal soil for com­mod­ity mar­kets to flour­ish.</p>
    <p>With eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity bounc­ing back, es­pe­cially in China, com­mod­ity de­mand is likely to in­crease firmly in this half of this year.</p>
    <p>Our anal­y­sis has found that over the last 30 years, com­mod­ity re­turns on an as­set class level tended to rise strongly when global eco­nomic growth ac­cel­er­ated.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, sup­ply has been cur­tailed by the Covid-19-led shut­downs in the first half, vol­un­tary cuts to pro­duc­tion (such as for oil), and var­i­ous other dis­rup­tions, in­clud­ing shut-ins due to low prices and sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The oil mar­ket, in par­tic­u­lar, is show­ing sig­nif­i­cant re­straint at the mo­ment, fol­low­ing the del­uge of sup­ply ear­lier in the year.</p>
    <p>The sup­ply of sev­eral base me­tals is also fall­ing, which is con­tribut­ing to the tight over­all pic­ture for the as­set class.</p>
    <p>With a well-be­haved sup­ply side and re­cov­er­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity glob­ally, we ex­pect broad com­mod­ity in­dexes like the UBS Bloomberg CMCI Com­pos­ite In­dex to rise by about 10 per cent to 15 per cent on a spot ba­sis over the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>CRUDE GAINS AHEAD</p>
    <p>Oil prices should grad­u­ally rise over the next year on less sup­ply and more de­mand, re­sult­ing in an un­der-sup­plied oil mar­ket in this half and next year.</p>
    <p>Global crude sup­ply con­tracted to a nine-year low in June, driven by a con­flu­ence of Opec+ cuts, pro­duc­tion cur­tail­ments on the back of US sanc­tions (Libya, Venezuela and Iran), and price-in­duced pro­duc­tion shut-ins in North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>De­mand, on the other hand, is set to grad­u­ally re­bound along­side the nor­mal­i­sa­tion of so­cial ac­tiv­ity and the re­cov­ery of the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Our fore­cast is for Brent price to rise to US$55 a bar­rel by the mid­dle of next year; it could rise fur­ther in the longer term to US$70 to US$80, due to de­clin­ing out­put in ma­tur­ing oil fields com­bined with a lack of in­vest­ment in new sup­ply.</p>
    <p>But while this presents a strong spot ap­pre­ci­a­tion, roll yields would erode some of the po­ten­tial re­turns. So in­stead of out­right buy­ing to take ad­van­tage of higher oil prices ahead, in­vestors with a high risk tol­er­ance could sell Brent’s down­side price risks for a yield pickup.</p>
    <p>Pre­cious me­tals, as a whole, have surged this year, thanks largely to a con­ducive mon­e­tary and fis­cal back­drop.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the last three US re­ces­sions, longer-dated bonds of­fered in­vestors a spread of 300 to 400 ba­sis points over money mar­ket rates.</p>
    <p>This time, though, the term spread is largely gone for 10-year US Trea­suries and down to around a third for 30-year Trea­suries. Also, ris­ing in­fla­tion ex­pec­ta­tions have pushed the yield on 10-year US Trea­sury in­fla­tion-pro­tected se­cu­ri­ties to a record low of mi­nus 1.12 per cent.</p>
    <p>So with US Trea­suries yield­ing lit­tle, in­vestor in­ter­est in gold as an al­ter­na­tive hedge should re­main high. Fur­ther­more, gold should ben­e­fit from a weak US dol­lar due to the sub­stan­tial fis­cal and mon­e­tary stim­u­lus in the US.</p>
    <p>Al­though gold has re­traced some gains re­cently, we ex­pect it to retest the level of US$2,000 an ounce. It could even rise to US$2,200 to US$2,300 if the global re­cov­ery doesn’t pan out as an­tic­i­pated, or if it takes longer than ex­pected for a coron­avirus vac­cine to be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver, mean­while, has out­per­formed gold in re­cent months. But we ex­pect it to move more in lock­step with gold from now.</p>
    <p>We rec­om­mend hold­ing gold for di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion pur­poses, and pre­fer it to sil­ver for its hedg­ing qual­i­ties. In­vestors with a high risk tol­er­ance can also con­sider qual­ity gold stocks.</p>
    <p>The yel­low metal is up 27 per cent this year...</p>
    <p>As a per­ceived safe haven, gold has thrived amid a his­toric global re­ces­sion. And as a non-yield-bear­ing as­set, it has ben­e­fited from the steep slide in real in­ter­est rates.</p>
