    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • At times this reg­u­lar sea­son, the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers have looked like the cham­pi­onship con­tenders many had tipped them to be when Kawhi Leonard joined last sum­mer.</p>
    <p>At other times, they have looked very much like a work in progress, with Leonard’s “load man­age­ment” pro­gramme – de­signed to main­tain his fit­ness – and pe­ri­ods of ab­sence for Paul Ge­orge, Pa­trick Bev­er­ley, Lou Wil­liams and Mon­trezl Har­rell not help­ing the team’s chem­istry.</p>
    <p>But after seal­ing the sec­ond seed in the Western Con­fer­ence with a 124-111 Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) vic­tory over the Den­ver Nuggets on Wed­nes­day, Clip­pers coach Doc Rivers feels that the post-sea­son is when his play­ers will step up.</p>
    <p>He has ev­ery rea­son to be­lieve that. Leonard led the Toronto Rap­tors to their first cham­pi­onship ti­tle last year, earn­ing his sec­ond Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player award and be­com­ing just the third player to do so with two dif­fer­ent teams.</p>
    <p>Ge­orge, the Clip­pers’ other star re­cruit last year, has never won the sport’s big­gest prize.</p>
    <p>But in his nine years as a pro­fes­sional, he has helped his two pre­vi­ous teams, the In­di­ana Pac­ers and Ok­la­homa City Thun­der, reach the play-offs eight times, with the sole ex­cep­tion be­ing in 2015, when he suf­fered a bro­ken leg.</p>
    <p>On the for­ward pair, who com­bined for 53 points against Den­ver, Rivers said: “(Both are) in great shape, which is just where we want them to be. We want to win it all.”</p>
    <p>Bev­er­ley is feel­ing equally con­fi­dent, hail­ing Leonard as “the best player in the NBA”.</p>
    <p>They will, how­ever, need to draw on his and Ge­orge’s ex­pe­ri­ence if they are to get through the ul­tra com­pet­i­tive West.</p>
    <p>Not only have the Clip­pers never gone past the semi-fi­nals, but their first-round op­po­nents next week, sev­enth-seeded Dal­las Mav­er­icks, are hun­gry and into the post-sea­son for the first time since 2016.</p>
    <p>A match-up be­tween Los An­ge­les’ front-court pair, and reign­ing</p>
    <p>Rookie of the Year Luka Don­cic and Kristaps Porzingis is set to be par­tic­u­larly ex­plo­sive, so Ge­orge wants his team­mates to be laser-fo­cused.</p>
    <p>He said: “We know what’s at stake and we know what we’re here for. This group is con­fi­dent.”</p>
    <p>Leonard added: “(Now we) get in bet­ter habits with less mis­takes go­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Den­ver, in third, will take on sixth seed Utah Jazz in the first round of the play-off “bub­ble”.</p>
