    <p>The Malaysian au­thor­i­ties have tight­ened cam­paign­ing re­stric­tions in sev­eral red-zone ar­eas in Sabah, as the Covid-19 outbreak in the east­ern­most state wors­ens in a cru­cial week when a mil­lion el­i­gi­ble vot­ers can head out to cast their votes in the state elections.</p>
    <p>Malaysia saw a re­turn to tripledigi­t daily in­fec­tions on Wed­nes­day, re­port­ing 147 cases na­tion­wide. Sabah, which is on Bor­neo is­land, con­tin­ued to be the epi­cen­tre, with 134 of the cases com­ing from the state alone.</p>
    <p>The na­tion­wide tally yes­ter­day dropped to 71 new cases, with 63 of them in Sabah.</p>
    <p>There are three red zones – La­had Datu, Tawau and Sem­porna – all of them on the east coast of Sabah.</p>
    <p>The Elec­tion Com­mis­sion on Wed­nes­day said that cam­paign­ing in the red-zone ar­eas is still al­lowed, but with tighter re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Only a max­i­mum of two peo­ple are al­lowed into vot­ers’ homes dur­ing door-to-door cam­paign­ing, while only 30 peo­ple can gather in a sin­gle lo­ca­tion for events such as campaign ral­lies.</p>
    <p>The new re­stric­tions come af­ter two politi­cians from Umno, part of the fed­eral rul­ing coali­tion, tested pos­i­tive for the virus af­ter re­turn­ing from cam­paign­ing in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Party supreme coun­cil mem­ber Mohd Ra­zlan Rafii was hos­pi­talised af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive, while in­for­ma­tion chief Shahril Ham­dan re­vealed on Wed­nes­day that he was in­fected with the virus.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment re­laxed move­ment curbs on June 10, and the outbreak seemed rel­a­tively in con­trol till the emer­gence of a Ben­teng clus­ter in the eastern district of La­had Datu early this month. The outbreak orig­i­nated in a de­ten­tion cen­tre where il­le­gal im­mi­grants were held in a crowded cell, re­sult­ing in the spread of the virus among de­tainees and po­lice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The outbreak has also spread to Tawau and Sem­porna.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion in Sabah has shown no signs of abat­ing, with the state re­port­ing the high­est num­ber of cases for more than three weeks con­sec­u­tively.</p>
    <p>In the past two weeks, it has seen 715 cases, which make up around 85 per cent of all the cases re­ported in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has re­ported 10,576 Covid-19 cases so far, with 133 deaths.</p>
    <p>The Sabah state polls take place tomorrow, with 1.1 mil­lion reg­is­tered vot­ers el­i­gi­ble to take part. A stag­ger­ing 447 can­di­dates are vy­ing for 73 state assem­bly seats.</p>
