    <p>A 42-year-old Cer­tis Cisco of­fi­cer was found with a gun­shot wound to the head in East Coast Park last Satur­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Po­lice found the aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cer at about 6.15am near East Coast Park’s carpark C2. The gun is­sued to the of­fi­cer was found be­side him, the po­lice said. Paramedics de­clared him dead at 7.48am.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day at about 1.30am, Cer­tis in­formed the po­lice that the of­fi­cer did not re­turn his ser­vice re­volver af­ter his shift ended. This led the po­lice to start a search for him.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing, but they do not sus­pect foul play.</p>
    <p>When asked how long the of­fi­cer had been with the firm, Cer­tis de­clined to give de­tails about the man.</p>
    <p>Deputy As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner Ju­lian Chee, who is Com­man­der of Cer­tis Cisco Aux­il­iary Po­lice Force, said Cer­tis is as­sist­ing the po­lice with in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “We are deeply sad­dened to learn that one of our aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cers has passed away. We are in con­tact with his next of kin and will pro­vide our sup­port and as­sis­tance to them in this dif­fi­cult time.”</p>
