    <p>OR­LANDO • Jimmy But­ler was ex­hausted. But he fought on, putting the Miami Heat on his back in the fi­nal min­utes and re­fus­ing to let their cham­pi­onship dreams die.</p>
    <p>Play­ing to the point of ex­haus­tion and be­yond, he scored 35 points, grabbed 12 re­bounds, passed off 11 as­sists and made five steals in Miami’s 111-108 vic­tory on Fri­day over the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers, cut­ting the deficit to 3-2 in the best-of-seven Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals se­ries.</p>
    <p>“I left it all out there on the floor along with my guys,” said But­ler, who played 47-plus min­utes. “And that’s how we’re go­ing to have to play from here. This is the po­si­tion we’re in, we like it this way, (and) we’ve got two more to (win).”</p>
    <p>The weary play­maker – who shot 11-of-19 from the floor and 12-of-12 from the free-throw line – slumped on an ad­ver­tise­ment board be­yond the end of the court be­fore hit­ting the free throws that put the Heat ahead with 16.8 sec­onds re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>He traded scores with four-time NBA Most Valu­able Player LeBron James on six straight pos­ses­sions in the fi­nal two min­utes, car­ry­ing Miami just far enough to force a Game 6 to­day.</p>
    <p>“That’s what the team asked of me. That’s what they need me to do,” added But­ler, who also had a triple-dou­ble in his team’s Game 3 win. “I know I’m ca­pa­ble of it. I have a great group of guys around me. That gives me a lot of con­fi­dence to go out there and hoop.”</p>
    <p>Heat coach Erik Spoel­stra could not praise his star player enough af­ter the game, say­ing: “His will to win is re­mark­able. To do that in 47-plus min­utes and take the chal­lenge on the other end, ev­ery young player com­ing into this league should study footage on Jimmy But­ler.”</p>
    <p>Dun­can Robin­son added 26 points for Miami, while Ken­drick Nunn chipped in 14, Bam Ade­bayo con­trib­uted 13, Tyler Herro had 12 and Jae Crow­der scored 11.</p>
    <p>James amassed 40 points, 13 re­bounds, seven as­sists and three steals for the Lak­ers. An­thony Davis fin­ished with 28 points, 12 boards and three blocks.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers had a chance to clinch the ti­tle, but Danny Green missed a wide-open three-pointer, and then Marki­eff Mor­ris turned the ball over with 2.2 sec­onds left.</p>
    <p>Herro’s two foul shots with 1.6 sec­onds left put the Heat up by three, and James’ half-court heave at the buzzer was off the mark.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter ad­mit­ted But­ler out­played him down the stretch.</p>
    <p>“That was back and forth, big play af­ter big play,” James said. “That’s the beauty of the game, be­ing able to com­pete at the high­est level.</p>
    <p>“You take those op­por­tu­ni­ties and live in the mo­ment. We were both just try­ing to do that and will our teams to vic­tory. He was able to make one more play than I was tonight and get the vic­tory.”</p>
    <p>The key play was a foul call on the Davis with 16.8sec left when But­ler drove to the hoop, one James lamented. “I thought he was chest to chest with Jimmy and the call didn’t go our way. It was a tough call,” he said.</p>
    <p>Look­ing be­yond the de­feat, James has urged his team­mates to sim­ply fo­cus on win­ning Game 6, in­stead of think­ing about lift­ing the tro­phy.</p>
    <p>“You take the game as it’s go­ing and you play,” he said. “You play each quar­ter, you play each pos­ses­sion and you live with the re­sults.</p>
    <p>“You have to live in the mo­ment and pre­pare your­self each and ev­ery pos­ses­sion, be­cause if you start to wan­der and your mind starts to go, you make a mis­take.”</p>
