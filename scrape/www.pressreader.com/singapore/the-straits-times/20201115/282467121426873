    <p>Can three words launch a ca­reer? They did, for Max­ine Ngooi.</p>
    <p>After grad­u­at­ing from Sydney Univer­sity with a de­gree in com­merce, she wanted to en­rol in culi­nary school. But she had been in Aus­tralia for five years and did not want to spend more of her par­ents’ money.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to be sure this was the route I wanted to take,” she tells The Sun­day Times. “So I fig­ured I would work for a bit, see if I liked it.”</p>
    <p>She started by ap­ply­ing to neigh­bour­hood and small bak­eries. They turned her down be­cause she had no for­mal train­ing.</p>
    <p>“My older sis­ter asked me to try for Les Amis,” she says. “I thought, why would they take me?”</p>
    <p>Then her sis­ter said those three words – no harm try­ing.</p>
    <p>Ngooi joined the dessert team at the restau­rant, un­der pas­try chef Ch­eryl Koh, and her pas­try ca­reer launched into or­bit.</p>
    <p>The fine-din­ing restau­rant, which has three Miche­lin stars, did not have a slot but chef Koh gave the new­bie a two-week trial.</p>
    <p>Chef Ngooi says: “I made a lot of mis­takes, I was very messy. But I was learn­ing a lot and re­ally en­joyed it. At the end of the two weeks, she of­fered me a po­si­tion. I think it was the at­ten­tion to de­tail, be­ing metic­u­lous with the lit­tle jobs. It’s my char­ac­ter. I tend to be a perfection­ist.”</p>
    <p>Aside from hang­ing out in the kitchen with her mother, she would bake lemon pop­py­seed cakes and cin­na­mon rolls when study­ing in Aus­tralia, and took a class to learn how to make mac­arons. Les Amis taught her the fun­da­men­tals of French pas­try.</p>
    <p>She says: “It’s so sci­en­tific and tech­ni­cal. For me, it was eas­ier to grasp than hot cook­ing. When Ch­eryl teaches, she ex­plains the sci­ence be­hind the tech­niques. That re­ally in­trigued me.”</p>
    <p>After six months at the restau­rant, she fol­lowed chef Koh, who went on to start Tarte by Ch­eryl Koh, and spent a year work­ing with her men­tor. Then she went to Aus­tralia to work for three months.</p>
    <p>She was at farm-to-ta­ble restau­rant Brae in Vic­to­ria, where staff would pick fruit and veg­eta­bles, and col­lect eggs from the restau­rant’s farm to cook with; Koi, the Sydney dessert restau­rant started by MasterChef Aus­tralia con­tes­tant Reynold Po­er­nomo; and Six­penny, a restau­rant in New South Wales with a fo­cus on Aus­tralian pro­duce.</p>
    <p>In these restau­rants, she learnt about the pro­duce she could po­ten­tially work with, and also about molec­u­lar desserts at Koi.</p>
    <p>Back in Sin­ga­pore, she worked at L’Ate­lier de Joel Robu­chon at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa, do­ing plated desserts, then moved on to</p>
    <p>the dessert trol­ley and mignardise­s at Joel Robu­chon Restau­rant. There, she was pro­moted and over­saw two staff turn­ing out desserts.</p>
    <p>When the restau­rant closed in 2018, she was of­fered the head pas­try chef role at Vian­ney Mas­sot Restau­rant, helmed by the for­mer ex­ec­u­tive chef of L’Ate­lier de Joel Robu­chon.</p>
    <p>She quit ear­lier this year, in­tend­ing to travel and work at, among other places, Coda, a t woMiche­lin-starred dessert restau­rant in Ber­lin. “I didn’t know that dessert restau­rants could have Miche­lin stars,” she says.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pandemic hap­pened and, for­tu­itously, the in­vestors i n Vian­ney Mas­sot Restau­rant, the Ebb & Flow Group, which runs modern Chi­nese restau­rant The Dragon Cham­ber in Cir­cu­lar Road and burger restau­rant Love Han­dle in Ann Siang Hill, among oth­ers, took her into the fold.</p>
    <p>She has been sell­ing her pas­try boxes since July. To make and sell more boxes, she will need big­ger premises and more staff.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, she is us­ing the kitchen of the old Vian­ney Mas­sot Restau­rant in HongKong Street, and has one full-time staff.</p>
    <p>She is close to se­cur­ing a shop space, but de­clines to say where.</p>
    <p>When her store opens – she hopes it will be be­fore Christ­mas – she wants it to be a place where peo­ple can “chill over a crois­sant and cof­fee”.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers will be able to buy vi­en­nois­erie and whole cakes, and sit down for brunch.</p>
    <p>Some of­fer­ings in­clude Eurasian chicken pie, the fill­ing spiced with cin­na­mon, cloves and nut­meg; and gula me­laka and co­conut babka.</p>
    <p>“I’m the kind of per­son who likes warm, com­fort­ing and in­dul­gent food,” she says. “I hope to play around with Asian flavours, but I won’t force it.”</p>
