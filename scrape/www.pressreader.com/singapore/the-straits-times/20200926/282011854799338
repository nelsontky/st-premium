    <p>The on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic has a sil­ver lin­ing: It has raised aware­ness and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the role of health­care work­ers, in­clud­ing nurses. This is one rea­son why more peo­ple are switch­ing to nurs­ing mid-ca­reer.</p>
    <p>As a vet­eran nurse, I see this as a wel­come move be­cause nurs­ing can ben­e­fit from the in­flux of pro­fes­sion­als with di­verse ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>At the same time, th­ese mid-ca­reer adults will find that nurs­ing th­ese days of­fers a wide range of roles, far be­yond that of the clin­i­cal care in hos­pi­tal wards that most peo­ple are fa­mil­iar with to­day.</p>
    <p>In my 24 years as a nurse, I have seen the growth of nurs­ing as a pro­fes­sion and, in my mod­est way, con­trib­uted to this growth.</p>
    <p>I was in­volved in three changes to im­prove the nurs­ing pro­fes­sion over two decades.</p>
    <p>The first change was more em­pow­er­ment through re­duced hi­er­ar­chi­cal struc­ture; sec­ond, more path­ways for nurs­ing be­yond task-based roles; and third, in­volv­ing nurses in train­ing oth­ers (sup­port staff, care­givers and pa­tients) to take on tasks that were once per­formed only by nurses.</p>
    <p>FROM STU­DENT NURSE TO NURSE AD­MIN­IS­TRA­TOR</p>
    <p>My story be­gan when I was a stu­dent in the United King­dom from 1991 to 1995, at the Univer­sity of Manch­ester. I spent my fi­nal year of stud­ies as a com­mu­nity nurse, forg­ing friend­ships with pa­tients and link­ing them up with the fol­low-up care re­quired.</p>
    <p>I en­joyed the close in­ter­ac­tions and the feel­ing of ef­fi­cacy that came from be­ing able to help them with my nurs­ing skills. This was the pre­cise rea­son why I had wanted to be a nurse in the first place.</p>
    <p>In 1996, I re­turned to Sin­ga­pore and took up a po­si­tion as a reg­is­tered nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, hop­ing to re­peat the ex­pe­ri­ence of pro­fes­sional au­ton­omy I had en­joyed abroad.</p>
    <p>But my first three years in the gen­eral wards and in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) were spent on hon­ing my clin­i­cal (prac­ti­cal) skills in­stead, and I had to over­see the care of more than 12 pa­tients in each shift.</p>
    <p>The task-ori­ented as­pects of the job helped me un­der­stand why the pub­lic in Sin­ga­pore viewed nurs­ing as an “unglam­orous” job in­volv­ing hy­giene care, and why pa­tients and their fam­i­lies pre­ferred to dis­cuss im­por­tant de­ci­sions with doc­tors.</p>
    <p>As a ju­nior nurse, I ob­served that nurses re­ceived more com­pli­ments from pa­tients and fam­i­lies about their care ex­pe­ri­ence than doc­tors and al­lied health pro­fes­sion­als did. This is unique to a nurse’s call­ing and pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter three years in the wards, I took up an op­por­tu­nity to go on the nurs­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion track in 1999, hop­ing to ef­fect greater change.</p>
    <p>Over the decades, I found that two con­cepts are use­ful in un­der­stand­ing the chang­ing role of nurses: the idea of nurses be­yond nurs­ing; and nurs­ing be­yond nurses.</p>
    <p>“Nurses be­yond nurs­ing” means up­skilling nurses to achieve deeper pro­fes­sional com­pe­ten­cies as ad­vanced prac­tice nurses, nurse clin­i­cians, ward re­source nurses, prin­ci­pal nurses and com­mu­nity nurses.</p>
    <p>This in­volves redefin­ing and strength­en­ing the nurse’s role as a first re­spon­der and knowl­edge­able pa­tient and fam­ily ad­vo­cate.</p>
    <p>In the near fu­ture, we can ex­pect to see nurses un­der­tak­ing more clin­i­cal de­ci­sions and ini­ti­at­ing more or­ders of in­ves­ti­ga­tion and in­ter­ven­tion that are usu­ally taken on by doc­tors.</p>
    <p>This is the fu­ture of nurs­ing: learn­ing across dis­ci­plines and gain­ing trans-dis­ci­plinary skills – which means the nurse may be equipped with the com­pe­ten­cies of the doc­tor, phar­ma­cist and ther­a­pist to bet­ter man­age and in­te­grate care for the pa­tient, es­pe­cially in an age­ing pop­u­la­tion where we see more se­niors with com­plex con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“Nurs­ing be­yond nurses” em­pow­ers sup­port staff like health­care as­sis­tants, health at­ten­dants and pa­tient ser­vice as­so­ciates to take on value-added roles like venepunc­ture (punc­tur­ing a vein to draw blood), run­ning elec­tro­car­dio­gram and urine flow man­age­ment tests or the re­moval of in­tra­venous can­nu­lae (flex­i­ble tubes in­serted into veins).</p>
    <p>RENOVATING FOR THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>An­other in­ter­est­ing project I was in­volved in was the Ward of the Fu­ture (WOF) in­no­va­tion project in 2010.</p>
    <p>What started out as a ren­o­va­tion project to up­grade wards be­came the trans­for­ma­tion of in­pa­tient nurs­ing. This was against a back­drop where nurs­ing work was no­to­ri­ously ex­haust­ing, both phys­i­cally and emo­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>In our ini­tial stud­ies, we shad­owed a group of nurses for an en­tire shift over two weeks. We found that nurses spent most of their time away from the bed­side – each nurse could walk up to 8km in each shift and yet spend only about 10 per cent of his shift hours in di­rect care with the pa­tient and/or the pa­tient’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Such a dis­en­gag­ing ex­pe­ri­ence ag­gra­vated the nurses’ sense of phys­i­cal fa­tigue and be­came one of the top rea­sons for dis­sat­is­fac­tion at work. Con­se­quently, it con­trib­uted to a fairly high level of at­tri­tion among nurses.</p>
    <p>One key change was to re­design the lay­out of the ward to im­prove the nurses’ line of sight of pa­tients, to en­able more di­rect pa­tient care.</p>
    <p>In our bid to im­prove line of sight for the nurses, we learnt that pa­tients also ex­pressed their com­fort about be­ing able to see a nurse nearby, thus mak­ing the en­vi­ron­ment con­ducive for heal­ing.</p>
    <p>The WOF project was awarded the Pub­lic Ser­vice’s Best Prac­tice Award for Or­gan­i­sa­tional De­vel­op­ment in 2014.</p>
    <p>Over three years, sig­nif­i­cant changes in­cluded im­prove­ments in re­sponse time to pa­tients’ needs (by about 25 per cent) and di­rect care time for nurses (from 10 per cent to 30 per cent).</p>
    <p>An­other project to get nurses across the ranks in­volved in com­ing up with good ideas to im­prove their prac­tice saw good re­sults.</p>
    <p>One in­no­va­tion was hav­ing new hos­pi­tal beds fit­ted with a mo­torised fifth wheel and a built-in weigh­ing scale, sav­ing half the trans­fer time and en­ergy to carry a pa­tient off the bed to be weighed.</p>
    <p>An­other in­no­va­tion was a one-piece hos­pi­tal gown with but­tons on the sides near the shoul­ders, and two straps at the back, for ICU pa­tients. This spe­cial de­sign allows lines and tubes to be ac­cessed eas­ily and for py­ja­mas to be changed in less time.</p>
    <p>Nurses in the wards also had an idea of spe­cially de­sign­ing hand mit­tens that are cush­ioned and fas­tened with zips, for pa­tients with de­men­tia or delir­ium. This pre­vents them from pulling out their tubes or catheters if they be­come ag­i­tated or rest­less.</p>
    <p>THE FU­TURE OF NURS­ING</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, we have pro­gres­sively re­moved un­nec­es­sary man­ual tasks from nurses’ care re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. But core nurs­ing roles such as ba­sic hy­giene care that can­not be re­placed or au­to­mated in the near fu­ture will re­main im­por­tant tasks.</p>
    <p>As nurses, we see this as part of be­ing a “com­plete” healer – to in­flu­ence and de­cide the path of heal­ing for the pa­tient, and then be a part­ner of the pa­tient and fam­ily all the way in their heal­ing jour­ney, even when cure is not (im­me­di­ately) im­mi­nent.</p>
    <p>But as the pop­u­la­tion ages rapidly, nurses will have to step up to a much big­ger role as ar­chi­tects of care, in­flu­enc­ing pa­tients, fam­i­lies and other stake­hold­ers in the area of care op­tions, mak­ing de­ci­sions on the best care for pa­tients and co­or­di­nat­ing care de­liv­ery with var­i­ous providers.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, doc­tors, not nurses, usu­ally per­form this role of de­cid­ing on and struc­tur­ing care for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>But this has to change in or­der to achieve a sus­tain­able care model in a rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion. This is be­cause care in­ter­ven­tions are not as straight­for­ward as be­fore, and may re­quire more mu­tual goal set­tings and mul­ti­ple ad­just­ments along the heal­ing process.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, many peo­ple, in­clud­ing my­self, would pre­fer to age in place and within our home and neigh­bour­hood. For ex­am­ple, if my health con­di­tion is not too com­plex, I would pre­fer to see only one health­care prac­ti­tioner who is fa­mil­iar with my health pro­file so that costs re­main af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>As I see it, the nurse fits this role best. This is be­cause nurses are at al­most every touch point of the pa­tient’s health­care jour­ney, and we are in­creas­ingly com­pe­tent.</p>
    <p>Nurses in Sin­ga­pore are more than ready to play a piv­otal role in over­com­ing chal­lenges and trans­form­ing the way health­care is to be de­liv­ered in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>If we can keep our fo­cus on mak­ing a dif­fer­ence in the pa­tient’s heal­ing process, I firmly be­lieve we can achieve more and step up, as shown by how we have demon­strated courage, wis­dom and stead­fast­ness in fac­ing all dis­ease out­breaks so far.</p>
