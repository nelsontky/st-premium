    <p>• Frank Lam­pard was full of praise for Ben Chilwell, who scored his first Chelsea goal yes­ter­day as the de­fender’s dy­namic dis­play on his Premier League de­but with his new team in­spired a 4-0 home thrash­ing of Crys­tal Palace.</p>
    <p>Ham­pered by a heel in­jury, the 23-year-old had a de­layed start to his first sea­son with Chelsea fol­low­ing his £50 mil­lion (S$88 mil­lion) move from Le­ices­ter in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>But the Eng­land left-back is mak­ing up for lost time, de­liv­er­ing an in­flu­en­tial per­for­mance in his third game for the Blues fol­low­ing a pair of League Cup out­ings.</p>
    <p>“Ben was fan­tas­tic to­day. His abil­ity to be so high up the pitch, that’s not a bad thing, and his great qual­ity on the ball,” Lam­pard said on BT Sport. “The lads who have come in have all had is­sues, but Ben has shown what he’s all about.”</p>
    <p>While the Blues man­ager i nvested in a host of at­tack­ers after last sea­son, it was Chilwell’s ef­forts that broke down Palace’s stub­born de­fence. The left-back’s thump­ing fin­ish put Chelsea ahead at Stam­ford Bridge after half-time and it was his cross for Kurt Zouma’s header that dou­bled their lead.</p>
    <p>Jorginho added a pair of late penalties to com­plete the rout, but not be­fore striker Tammy Abra­ham lost an ar­gu­ment with skip­per Ce­sar Azpilicuet­a over tak­ing the sec­ond spot kick.</p>
    <p>“Not too many put four past Crys­tal Palace. It was great for us to get four goals,” said Lam­pard.</p>
    <p>“Just the ur­gency of our game needed more. We needed to get Ben into the game. We can’t al­low Palace’s back four to say deal­ing with Chelsea’s front line was easy.”</p>
    <p>Chilwell said: “It was a bril­liant team per­for­mance, and I’m ob­vi­ously very happy with my per­sonal per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea bounced back from their mid­week League Cup de­feat by Tot­ten­ham and ended a run of two league games with­out a win.</p>
    <p>The de­fen­sive blun­ders that con­trib­uted to their 3-3 draw at West Brom were erased and, cru­cially, Lam­pard’s men found their cut­ting edge against de­fen­sive op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Cap­ping an en­cour­ag­ing day, Chris­tian Pulisic came off the bench for a cameo in his first ap­pear­ance of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard had the lux­ury of start­ing goal­keeper Edouard Mendy for the first time in the league since his move from Rennes. With Azpilicuet­a and Jorginho back in the start­ing XI, Chelsea were more as­sured in pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>In a later game, Ever­ton went back to the top of the league as they beat Brighton 4-2 at Good­i­son Park. Colom­bian pair Yerry Mina and James Ro­driguez, who scored twice, added to top scorer Do­minic Calvert-Lewin’s opener to help the Tof­fees to their fourth league win in a row.</p>
