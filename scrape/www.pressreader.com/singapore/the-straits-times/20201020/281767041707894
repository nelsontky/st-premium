    <p>MANILA • Churches in the Philip­pine cap­i­tal Manila will now be al­lowed to open up to 30 per cent of their ca­pac­ity for wor­ship­pers, Manila Bishop Brod­er­ick Pa­billo said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In an interview with ABS-CBN’s Tel­er­adyo, the bishop said Manila Mayor Fran­cisco Do­magoso told him that he will is­sue an ex­ec­u­tive or­der eas­ing the cur­rent limit of 10 per cent of ca­pac­ity for churches in the city, amid the gen­eral com­mu­nity quar­an­tine im­posed to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I re­ceived in­for­ma­tion this morn­ing from the mayor and from Sec­re­tary Gue­varra that they will al­low church­go­ers to oc­cupy 30 per cent of churches’ ca­pac­ity,” said the bishop, re­fer­ring to Jus­tice Sec­re­tary Me­nardo Gue­varra. “This means we are invit­ing those who are al­lowed to go out to en­ter churches.”</p>
    <p>Bishop Pa­billo said he was also told that cur­few hours would be re­laxed in Metro Manila start­ing in De­cem­ber to al­low tra­di­tional night masses to be con­ducted for the Christ­mas sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the bishop, churches in Manila will hold more masses to al­low at­ten­dees to prac­tise phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines yes­ter­day recorded 2,638 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, rais­ing the to­tal number of con­firmed cases to 359,169. Another 26 deaths were recorded, tak­ing to­tal fa­tal­i­ties to 6,675, said the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Metropoli­tan Manila De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity gen­eral manager Jojo Gar­cia said yes­ter­day that Metro Manila may­ors want to keep the gen­eral com­mu­nity quar­an­tine sta­tus in the cap­i­tal until Dec 31, but with eased busi­ness, travel and cur­few re­stric­tions to re­vi­talise the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Gar­cia said the may­ors will sub­mit a rec­om­men­da­tion to the in­ter-agency coro­n­avirus task force, which will then present it to President Ro­drigo Duterte for ap­proval. He said the task force also ap­proved “in prin­ci­ple” the pro­posal to shorten cur­few hours in Metro Manila, ex­cept for one city, from mid­night to 4am, start­ing this week.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte im­posed a strict lock­down in Metro Manila and other high-risk re­gions in mid-March to stop the spread of Covid-19. The Philip­pines is still un­der vary­ing lev­els of lock­down as it grap­ples with the pan­demic.</p>
