    <p>PARIS • France has placed its cap­i­tal Paris on max­i­mum Covid-19 alert, mean­ing bars will close for two weeks from to­day and restau­rants will have to put in place new san­i­tary pro­to­cols to stay open.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex’s of­fice yes­ter­day said there had been no im­prove­ment in the Paris re­gion since the cap­i­tal passed all three of the gov­ern­ment’s cri­te­ria for be­ing put on the high­est level of alert in the mid­dle of last week.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home should be pri­ori­tised “now more than ever” in the Paris area and univer­sity lec­ture halls should be no more than half full, Mr Cas­tex’s of­fice said in a state­ment. The re­in­forced re­stric­tions will take ef­fect from to­day.</p>
    <p>“These mea­sures, in­dis­pens­able in the fight to curb the virus’ spread, will ap­ply to Paris and the three de­part­ments im­me­di­ately sur­round­ing it, for a du­ra­tion of two weeks,” it said.</p>
    <p>For a city to be placed on max­i­mum alert, the in­ci­dence rate must ex­ceed 100 in­fec­tions per 100,000 among el­derly in­hab­i­tants and 250 per 100,000 among the gen­eral pub­lic, while at least 30 per cent of in­ten­sive care beds are re­served for coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A week ago, restau­rants and bars were shut down for a fort­night in Mar­seille, the south­ern city at the epi­cen­tre of the sec­ond wave, prompt­ing protests and an un­suc­cess­ful le­gal chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants in Mar­seille will be al­lowed to re­open early un­der the same new pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>France on Sun­day re­ported 12,565 new cases of coro­n­avirus, while 893 Covid-19 pa­tients were ad­mit­ted to in­ten­sive care in hos­pi­tal over the past week.</p>
    <p>Over in Ire­land, the gov­ern­ment faced po­lit­i­cal and business re­sis­tance yes­ter­day to a sur­prise rec­om­men­da­tion by health chiefs for Europe’s first ma­jor sec­ond-wave na­tional lock­down to pre­vent hos­pi­tals from be­ing over­whelmed as coro­n­avirus cases rise.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Pub­lic Health Emer­gency Team called for a leap to the high­est level of Covid-19 re­stric­tions, Level 5, late on Sun­day, just three days af­ter telling the gov­ern­ment the cur­rent Level 2 sta­tus for most of the coun­try was ap­pro­pri­ate. Un­der Level 5, peo­ple would be asked to stay at home, ex­cept to ex­er­cise within 5km, with only es­sen­tial re­tail­ers al­lowed to stay open.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers of the three gov­ern­ing coali­tion part­ners were sched­uled to meet Ire­land’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer yes­ter­day be­fore Cabi­net con­sid­ers the ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Ire­land re­opened its econ­omy at a slower pace than most of Europe from May and while its large multi­na­tional sec­tor has shielded it from the worst of the eco­nomic hit, the un­em­ploy­ment rate is stuck at just be­low 15 per cent even as the gov­ern­ment props up wages in many parts of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In Italy, the gov­ern­ment will likely im­pose new curbs on the coun­try this week to try to beat back ris­ing num­bers of coro­n­avirus cases, Health Min­is­ter Roberto Sper­anza said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Cabi­net is due to meet to­day to de­cide how to re­spond to an in­crease in in­fec­tions, with south­ern Ital­ian re­gions for the first time look­ing vul­ner­a­ble to the dis­ease. The mea­sures un­der re­view in­clude mak­ing the wear­ing of masks oblig­a­tory out­doors and rein­tro­duc­ing curbs on so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
