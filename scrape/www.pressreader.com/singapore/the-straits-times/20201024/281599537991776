    <p>Re­spond­ing to re­ports that Pope Fran­cis had en­dorsed same-sex civil unions in the new doc­u­men­tary Francesco, the Ro­man Catholic Arch­dio­cese of Sin­ga­pore said the Catholic Church’s stance on mar­riage re­mains un­changed.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to re­ports that in the new doc­u­men­tary Francesco, Pope Fran­cis had en­dorsed same-sex civil unions, the Ro­man Catholic Arch­dio­cese of Sin­ga­pore said on Thurs­day that the Catholic Church’s stance on mar­riage re­mains un­changed.</p>
    <p>Any com­ment made by Pope Fran­cis that has been recorded in a doc­u­men­tary “is not con­sid­ered or ad­mis­si­ble as an of­fi­cial pa­pal teach­ing”, it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The “Catholic un­der­stand­ing of mar­riage is de­fined as the sacra­ment by which a bap­tised man and a bap­tised woman bind them­selves for life in law­ful mar­riage”, said the Arch­dio­cese, which over­sees all Catholic churches in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This con­stant teach­ing on mar­riage “re­mains un­changed re­gard­less of a civil union be­tween two per­sons of the same sex ap­proved by the state”, it added.</p>
    <p>“We do not know at the mo­ment what the Holy Fa­ther ac­tu­ally said in the in­ter­view and the con­text of what he said,” said the Arch­dio­cese, adding that it has not had an of­fi­cial state­ment or com­mu­ni­ca­tion from the Vat­i­can.</p>
    <p>“What is le­gal in so­ci­ety is not nec­es­sar­ily moral or licit for Catholics in the teach­ing of the Church.”</p>
    <p>Civil unions are legally recog­nised re­la­tion­ships granted sim­i­lar le­gal rights as con­ven­tional mar­riages.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­ports, Pope Fran­cis had said in the doc­u­men­tary, which pre­miered at the Rome Film Fes­ti­val this week: “Ho­mo­sex­ual peo­ple have a right to be in a fam­ily. They are chil­dren of God and have a right to a fam­ily. No­body should be thrown out or be made mis­er­able over it. What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally cov­ered. I stood up for that.”</p>
    <p>The Pope ap­peared to be re­fer­ring to when he was arch­bishop of Buenos Aires and op­posed leg­is­la­tion to ap­prove same-sex mar­riages but sup­ported some kind of le­gal pro­tec­tion for gay cou­ples’ rights.</p>
    <p>The re­marks have elicited praise from lib­er­als and also calls for ur­gent clar­i­fi­ca­tion from con­ser­va­tives.</p>
    <p>The Catholic Church teaches that ho­mo­sex­ual ten­den­cies are not sin­ful but ho­mo­sex­ual acts are. It teaches that ho­mo­sex­u­als should be treated with dig­nity, but is op­posed to gay mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ques­tions arose about the ori­gins of the quote, a Mex­i­can broad­caster on Thurs­day con­firmed that Pope Fran­cis’ com­ments were made dur­ing an in­ter­view in May last year that was never broad­cast in full.</p>
    <p>In the doc­u­men­tary, the Pope was also seen to have used the Span­ish phrase “con­viven­cia civil”, trans­lated in the sub­ti­tles as “civil union”.</p>
    <p>Some Span­ish-speak­ing priests have said the trans­la­tion is in­ac­cu­rate and that it is ac­tu­ally bet­ter trans­lated as “law of civil con­vivience” or “civil co­ex­is­tence”. This would mean that Pope Fran­cis was talk­ing about some kind of le­gal pro­tec­tion but not a ho­mo­sex­ual civil union.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to Catholic News Agency, Arch­bishop Vic­tor Manuel Fer­nan­dez, a long-time ad­viser to Pope Fran­cis, clar­i­fied that the Pope’s phrase is sub­stan­tially equiv­a­lent to the phrase “civil union”. He said this view re­flects the Pope’s stance as a bishop in Ar­gentina that ac­cept­ing civil unions might be a way to pre­vent the pas­sage of same­sex mar­riage laws in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The “Catholic un­der­stand­ing of mar­riage is de­fined as the sacra­ment by which a bap­tised man and a bap­tised woman bind them­selves for life in law­ful mar­riage”, said the Ro­man Catholic Arch­dio­cese of Sin­ga­pore. This con­stant teach­ing on mar­riage “re­mains un­changed re­gard­less of a civil union be­tween two per­sons of the same sex ap­proved by the state”, it added.</p>
