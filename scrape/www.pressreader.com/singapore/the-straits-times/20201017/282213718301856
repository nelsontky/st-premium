    <p>Ten­cent Hold­ings has cho­sen a cowork­ing space for its first of­fice in Sin­ga­pore, join­ing other Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy giants in us­ing the city state as a launch­ing pad into the rest of Asia.</p>
    <p>The WeChat owner – which said last month it would open an of­fice in Sin­ga­pore – will have al­most 200 seats at JustCo’s co-work­ing space in OCBC Cen­tre East at Raf­fles Place. This was ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the plans who asked not to be named be­cause the mat­ter is pri­vate. The space amounts to 10,000 sq ft.</p>
    <p>The lease runs for one year, giv­ing China’s largest so­cial me­dia and video gam­ing com­pany flex­i­bil­ity to seek a larger space as it adds staff, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives for Ten­cent and JustCo did not i mme­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The deal paves the way for Ten­cent to make Sin­ga­pore its beach­head for a push into South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>ByteDance, the owner of pop­u­lar video app TikTok, is also ex­pand­ing its of­fice space in the city state, while Alibaba Group Hold­ing ear­lier this year bought a 50 per cent stake in a Sin­ga­pore of­fice tower.</p>
    <p>The de­mand from Chi­nese tech firms could also boost Sin­ga­pore’s of­fice mar­ket, which has been bat­tered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with some com­pa­nies va­cat­ing leases and land­lords forced to cut rents.</p>
    <p>Tech firms have taken up 350,000 sq ft of of­fice space in new leases and ex­pan­sions this year, and that could rise to 400,000 sq ft to 500,000 sq ft next year, Cush­man & Wake­field es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is seen as an at­trac­tive base as it pro­vides a gate­way to</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s 650 mil­lion smart­phone-savvy pop­u­la­tion. It also of­fers rel­a­tive po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and de­vel­oped fi­nan­cial and le­gal sys­tems.</p>
    <p>China’s tech giants are in­creas­ingly turn­ing their at­ten­tion to the re­gion amid grow­ing hos­til­ity from the United States and In­dia.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion wants to re­move WeChat from mo­bile app stores in the US and im­pose other re­stric­tions, though a court has blocked the move. In­dia has barred the com­pany’s hit games, PUBG Mo­bile and Arena of Valor.</p>
    <p>Choos­ing a co-work­ing space gives com­pa­nies “the ad­van­tage to be flex­i­ble in mar­kets where head­count growth is un­clear and there is a pos­si­bil­ity that busi­ness can grow so quickly that they run out of space,” said Ms Chris­tine Li, Cush­man & Wake­field’s head of re­search and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment ser­vices for South-east Asia. It is a com­mon strat­egy for tech firms en­ter­ing a new mar­ket – Alibaba and Face­book used it when they started in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
