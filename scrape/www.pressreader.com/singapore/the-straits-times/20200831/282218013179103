    <p>As far back as he can re­mem­ber, the twin touch­stones of real es­tate ex­ec­u­tive Paul Tham’s life have been wis­dom and learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Growing up, a fa­mil­iar mantra was one from the Book of Proverbs: “Wis­dom is the prin­ci­pal thing; there­fore get wis­dom: and with all thy get­ting get un­der­stand­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tham, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the man­ager of Sin­ga­pore Ex­change­listed Kep­pel Reit, re­calls: “My god­fa­ther taught me the im­por­tance of wis­dom and un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>“Both are tied to two key skills – the will­ing­ness to learn, as well as the abil­ity to learn con­tin­u­ously – and in­volve lots of hard work.”</p>
    <p>Driven by a pas­sion to build, Mr Tham be­gan his ca­reer as a struc­tural en­gi­neer in New York, af­ter earn­ing a Bach­e­lor of Sci­ence de­gree in civil and en­vi­ron­men­tal en­gi­neer­ing from Cor­nell Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“I was pick­ing up dif­fer­ent skills ev­ery day,” re­calls Mr Tham, 38, who also holds a mas­ter’s de­gree in busi­ness ad­min­is­tra­tion from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“In one... vol­un­teer project to build a school in up­state New York, we ended up do­ing most of the con­struc­tion work our­selves – driv­ing fork­lifts and op­er­at­ing small ex­ca­va­tors. That was one of the most sat­is­fy­ing projects I was in­volved in.”</p>
    <p>His next stop – Bain & Com­pany, as a man­age­ment con­sul­tant work­ing with multi­na­tion­als in the Asi­aPa­cific on a wide range of func­tions, in­clud­ing growth strate­gies.</p>
    <p>“Man­age­ment con­sult­ing teaches you to learn con­tin­u­ously,” he notes. “You’re work­ing on new projects, reading re­ports, ask­ing ques­tions all the time. You have to work hard to pick up knowl­edge on new in­dus­tries and mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“And the fastest way to learn is to tap the ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence of oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>In 2014, Mr Tham joined Kep­pel</p>
    <p>Corp’s strat­egy and de­vel­op­ment unit and played a key role in the for­ma­tion of Kep­pel Cap­i­tal, even­tu­ally be­com­ing CEO of Kep­pel Reit Man­age­ment last year.</p>
    <p>PORT­FO­LIO OP­TI­MI­SA­TION</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Reit listed here in April 2006. It has a port­fo­lio of Grade A com­mer­cial as­sets in prime busi­ness dis­tricts across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Its as­sets un­der man­age­ment to­tal about $8 bil­lion in Sin­ga­pore, Syd­ney, Mel­bourne, Bris­bane, Perth and Seoul.</p>
    <p>The Reit is spon­sored by Kep­pel Land and man­aged by Kep­pel Reit Man­age­ment, a wholly owned unit of Kep­pel Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Tham has im­ple­mented key strate­gies to put the trust on a steady growth tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>The first is port­fo­lio op­ti­mi­sa­tion, which al­lows the Reit to achieve long-term sus­tain­able re­turns.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes di­vest­ing low­eryield­ing as­sets and so in­creas­ing the flex­i­bil­ity to fund growth through rein­vest­ment, con­tin­u­ing its unit buy­back pro­gramme, dis­tribut­ing cap­i­tal gains and paring debt.</p>
    <p>“Over the last two years, we’ve di­vested about $1.1 bil­lion worth of as­sets,” Mr Tham says, point­ing to the paring of a 20 per cent stake in Ocean Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre in De­cem­ber 2018 and the sale of Bugis Junc­tion Tow­ers last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“The fo­cus is to en­hance dis­tri­bu­tion per unit (DPU), and it seems to be work­ing, with Kep­pel Reit see­ing the first year-on-year in­crease in DPU in 2019 af­ter five years of de­cline.”</p>
    <p>DPU edged higher to 5.58 cents for the 12 months to Dec 31 last year, up from 5.56 cents the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond prong of Mr Tham’s strat­egy in­volves boost­ing cap­i­tal ef­fi­ciency by man­ag­ing both debt and eq­uity. In mid-2018, the trust</p>
