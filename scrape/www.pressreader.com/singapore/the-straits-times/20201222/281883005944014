    <p>MANILA • Manila teenager Rose Alvarez was 13 when she started hav­ing sex with a man who was more than twice her age. That would be statu­tory rape in most coun­tries, but not in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The Catholic-ma­jor­ity coun­try has one of the low­est ages of con­sent in the world, al­low­ing adults to legally have sex with chil­dren as young as 12.</p>
    <p>Child rights ac­tivists have lob­bied for decades to in­crease the age – en­shrined in the pe­nal code since 1930 – but faced re­sis­tance from what they de­scribe as a “cul­ture of pa­tri­archy” in a coun­try where abor­tion and divorce are il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>Congress now looks set to ap­prove a Bill to raise the age to 16.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign­ers say the leg­is­la­tion would help pro­tect young­sters in a na­tion that has be­come a global hot spot for on­line child sex abuse, and where more than 500 teenagers get preg­nant and give birth ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>“This is a vic­tory for Filipino chil­dren,” Ms Pa­trizia Ben­venuti, Unicef’s chief of child pro­tec­tion in the Philip­pines, said re­cently as the pro­posed leg­is­la­tion moved closer to a fi­nal vote.</p>
    <p>“Peg­ging 12 as the age of con­sent is re­ally not con­sis­tent with sci­en­tific stud­ies on brain de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>Rose, who be­came preg­nant when she was 14, says she now re­alises she had been too young for a sex­ual re­la­tion­ship and the de­mands of moth­er­hood.</p>
    <p>“I was still a child then, I didn’t know any­thing about sex,” Rose, now 16, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) at a clinic run by the Likhaan Cen­tre for Women’s Health in Navotas, one of the poor­est ar­eas of Manila.</p>
    <p>“I was telling him to use a con­dom... but he re­moved it. He didn’t want to use it,” said Rose, whose name has been changed to pro­tect her iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Rose – who un­til the age of 12 thought it was pos­si­ble to get preg­nant from kiss­ing – said she was drunk the first time she slept with the man, who was about 29 when they met on Face­book.</p>
    <p>“When I woke up, I was shocked to see blood in my un­der­wear and it hurt a lot. I was too in­tox­i­cated to know what was hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>‘CON­SEN­SUAL SEX’</p>
    <p>Child rape and sex­ual abuse are ram­pant in the Philip­pines, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>A woman or child is raped nearly ev­ery hour, Sen­a­tor Risa Hon­tiveros said in a doc­u­ment to the Se­nate, cit­ing fig­ures from the Cen­tre for Women’s Re­sources. Seven out of 10 vic­tims are chil­dren and the vast ma­jor­ity are girls, she said.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment-backed na­tion­wide study in 2015 showed one in five chil­dren aged 13 to 17 ex­pe­ri­enced sex­ual vi­o­lence, and one in 25 was raped in child­hood, the United Na­tions Chil­dren’s Fund said.</p>
    <p>But pros­e­cut­ing adult per­pe­tra­tors in rape cases in­volv­ing chil­dren has been dif­fi­cult be­cause they can ar­gue the sex was con­sen­sual, said Ms Rowena Le­gaspi, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Chil­dren’s Le­gal Rights and De­vel­op­ment Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Imag­ine a 12-year-old... that girl is still a mi­nor,” Ms Le­gaspi told AFP. “How could she have con­sented?”</p>
    <p>The pro­posed Bill would make it au­to­mat­i­cally il­le­gal and carry a penalty of life im­pris­on­ment, though it would not pun­ish young cou­ples close in age.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to be ap­proved by the Se­nate in the com­ing months be­fore go­ing to Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte to be signed into law.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists say in­creas­ing the age of con­sent will de­ter sex­ual preda­tors. But they cau­tion that more needs to be done to com­bat sex­ual vi­o­lence against chil­dren and one of the high­est rates of teenage preg­nancy in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>All chil­dren should have ac­cess to age-ap­pro­pri­ate sex ed­u­ca­tion from an early age, as well as in­for­ma­tion and ser­vices to make sex safer and avoid un­planned preg­nan­cies, said Mr Car­los Conde of Hu­man Rights Watch.</p>
