    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Hack­ers linked to Rus­sia, China and Iran are try­ing to spy on peo­ple tied to both United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den, Mi­crosoft Corp said.</p>
    <p>The re­port came amid rev­e­la­tions that one of Mr Bi­den’s main cam­paign ad­vi­sory firms had been warned by the Amer­i­can soft­ware gi­ant that it was in the cross hairs of the same Rus­sian hack­ers who in­ter­vened in the 2016 US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft’s state­ment, re­leased on Thurs­day, high­lights how ad­vis­ers to both cam­paigns are at risk from dig­i­tal spies world­wide, as the two can­di­dates face off on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment by Mi­crosoft’s vice-pres­i­dent for cus­tomer se­cu­rity Tom Burt said the group ac­cused of breach­ing Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton’s cam­paign e-mails in 2016 – a Rus­sian mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence-linked unit widely known as Fancy Bear – had spent the past year try­ing to break into ac­counts be­long­ing to po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tants serv­ing both Repub­li­cans and Democrats.</p>
    <p>Mr Burt also said Chi­nese hack­ers had gone af­ter peo­ple “closely as­so­ci­ated with US presidenti­al cam­paigns and can­di­dates” – in­clud­ing an un­named ally of Mr Bi­den who was tar­geted through a per­sonal e-mail ad­dress and “at least one prom­i­nent in­di­vid­ual for­merly as­so­ci­ated with the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion”.</p>
    <p>He added that Ira­nian hack­ers – which Mi­crosoft has al­ready called out pub­licly for at­tempts to spy on a US po­lit­i­cal cam­paign – had since tried to log in to ac­counts be­long­ing to Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials and mem­bers of the Re­pub­li­can Pres­i­dent’s cam­paign staff.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft’s an­nounce­ment was planned be­fore news broke that Fancy Bear was sus­pected of tar­get­ing Wash­ing­ton-based SKD­Knicker­bocker, a cam­paign strat­egy and com­mu­ni­ca­tions firm work­ing with Mr Bi­den and other Democrats.</p>
    <p>Mr Burt said the Chi­nese ef­fort to com­pro­mise Mr Bi­den’s ally and the Ira­nian spy­ing against the Trump cam­paign were un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing gen­er­ally, he said that for­eign hack­ing was in­ten­si­fy­ing as the vote drew nearer.</p>
    <p>“The ac­tiv­ity we are an­nounc­ing to­day makes clear that for­eign ac­tiv­ity groups have stepped up their ef­forts tar­get­ing the 2020 elec­tion as had been an­tic­i­pated.”</p>
    <p>The De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity’s top cy­ber of­fi­cial Christo­pher Krebs said Mi­crosoft’s warn­ing was con­sis­tent with ear­lier state­ments is­sued by the in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity about Rus­sian, Chi­nese, and Ira­nian spy­ing on elec­tion-re­lated tar­gets.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to high­light that none are in­volved in main­tain­ing or op­er­at­ing vot­ing in­fra­struc­ture and there was no iden­ti­fied im­pact on elec­tion sys­tems,” Mr Krebs said.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den and Trump cam­paigns both said they were aware of the tar­get­ing and were not sur­prised by it.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a joint press con­fer­ence in Moscow with his Rus­sian coun­ter­part Sergei Lavrov, Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi said China has never med­dled in US af­fairs. Mr Lavrov, in turn, said ac­cu­sa­tions of Rus­sia us­ing hack­ers to med­dle in US in­ter­nal af­fairs were “un­sub­stan­ti­ated”.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Em­bassy press sec­re­tary Niko­lay Lakhonin said Amer­i­cans had been dis­cussing “so-called in­ter­fer­ence” for years with­out pre­sent­ing what he de­scribed as “fac­tual ev­i­dence”.</p>
    <p>China ear­lier in the day ac­cused Mi­crosoft of “fab­ri­ca­tion” and “cre­at­ing trou­ble”. Its For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said the US was it­self an “em­pire of hack­ers”.</p>
    <p>Mr Alireza Miry­ousefi, spokesman for Iran’s United Na­tions mission in New York, said it was “pre­pos­ter­ous to even think that Iran would con­duct hack­ing”.</p>
    <p>It is not un­usual for state-backed hack­ers to go af­ter politi­cians in an elec­tion year.</p>
    <p>Mr John Hultquist, an an­a­lyst at cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pany FireEye’s Man­di­ant unit, said: “Par­ties and cam­paigns are good sources of in­tel­li­gence on fu­ture pol­icy.”</p>
    <p>But he added that he was par­tic­u­larly con­cerned by the news that Fancy Bear was ac­tive, say­ing the group his­tory of leak­ing data it hacked “raises the prospect of fol­low-on in­for­ma­tion op­er­a­tions or other dev­as­tat­ing ac­tiv­ity”.</p>
