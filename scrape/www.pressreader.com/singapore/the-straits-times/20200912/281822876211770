    <p>The deputy chief com­man­der of the Na­tional Po­lice, Gen­eral Ga­tot Eddy Pra­mono, said the in­volve­ment of pros­e­cu­tors and judges in adopt­ing a stricter ap­proach to­wards vi­o­la­tors of Covid-19 rules could en­cour­age the pub­lic to wear a mask with­out be­ing po­liced.</p>
    <p>JAKARTA • The In­done­sian gov­ern­ment is pre­par­ing to de­ploy of­fi­cers from var­i­ous in­sti­tu­tions to en­force mask-wear­ing pro­to­cols in sub­dis­tricts and vil­lages across the coun­try in a bid to curb ris­ing Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tion will in­volve of­fi­cers from the mil­i­tary, the po­lice, pub­lic or­der agen­cies, as well as pros­e­cu­tors and judges.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 Re­sponse and Na­tional Eco­nomic Re­cov­ery Com­mit­tee chair­man Erick Tho­hir said Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo had di­rected that In­done­sia’s 83,000 sub­dis­tricts and vil­lages be at the fore­front of Covid-19 man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“In­deed, this won’t be easy. Some­times there is a per­cep­tion that the gov­ern­ment wants to carry out re­pres­sive ac­tions,” Mr Erick, who is also the State-Owned En­ter­prises Min­is­ter, said on Thurs­day, as quoted by the Kom­pas news site.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Erick said, there needs to be stronger com­mu­nity dis­ci­pline, given that Covid-19 deaths and con­firmed cases con­tinue to rise.</p>
    <p>He claimed that, de­spite the na­tional case fa­tal­ity rate con­tin­u­ing to fall, from 9 per cent in April to 4 per cent this month, the fig­ure is still higher than the global rate, which stands at 3.27 per cent.</p>
    <p>The deputy chief com­man­der of the Na­tional Po­lice, Gen­eral Ga­tot Eddy Pra­mono, said the in­volve­ment of pros­e­cu­tors and judges in adopt­ing a stricter ap­proach to­wards vi­o­la­tors of Covid-19 rules could en­cour­age the pub­lic to wear a mask with­out be­ing po­liced.</p>
    <p>Gen Ga­tot, who is also the deputy head of the na­tional Covid-19 re­cov­ery com­mit­tee, fur­ther said that the joint of­fi­cers would co­or­di­nate with re­gional govern­ments to map the ar­eas prone to in­fec­tion, in­clud­ing mar­kets and of­fices and con­duct sur­veil­lance around the clock.</p>
    <p>But he said com­mu­nity fig­ures could also be in­volved un­der the di­rec­tion of na­tional se­cu­rity of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, In­done­sian Ulema Coun­cil deputy chair­man Muhyid­din Ju­naidi has ad­vised Mus­lims in coronaviru­s hot spots to pray at home af­ter the coun­try was hit by record new in­fec­tions in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>“Mus­lims in ar­eas with a high num­ber of (Covid-19) cases are ad­vised to re­frain from per­form­ing Friday and reg­u­lar prayers in pub­lic places,” Mr Muhyid­din said on Thurs­day, as quoted by the Tempo news site.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia recorded 3,737 virus cases yes­ter­day. It also reg­is­tered 88 deaths. This brings the to­tal cases in the coun­try to 210,940, while the num­ber of deaths is 8,544.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din ad­vised Mus­lims in ar­eas with a low num­ber of cases to ad­here to health pro­to­cols and to im­ple­ment them when per­form­ing prayers in pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>He also re­minded Mus­lims to help peo­ple in need through za­kat (alms) and do­na­tions, and urged preach­ers to ed­u­cate Mus­lims on the im­por­tance of health pro­to­cols through ser­mons.</p>
