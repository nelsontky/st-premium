    <p>A leader from Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion was sworn in as Sabah’s Chief Min­is­ter yesterday, three days after Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s loose al­liance man­aged to wrest con­trol of the state ad­min­is­tra­tion in in­tense state polls.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ha­jiji Mohd Noor, 65, is t he 16th Chief Min­is­ter of Malaysia’s eastern-most state, after his swear­ing-in by Gov­er­nor Juhar Mahirud­din. The politi­cian is the Sabah chief for both PN and Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu), Mr Muhyid­din’s party.</p>
    <p>Mr Ha­jiji was cho­sen as the chief min­is­ter can­di­date by the Gabun­gan Rakyat Ber­satu (GRS) al­liance after in­tense ne­go­ti­a­tions that lasted 36 hours be­cause another GRS fac­tion, the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional (BN), wanted its own can­di­date to take up the post.</p>
    <p>In the end, Mr Ha­jiji man­aged to get the sup­port of 41 out of 73 Sabah law­mak­ers elected last Satur­day – 38 from GRS and three in­de­pen­dent win­ners.</p>
    <p>Mr Ha­jiji’s ap­point­ment notched up another big win for Mr Muhyid­din, who is fac­ing a lead­er­ship challenge in Par­lia­ment from op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>De­spite GRS mem­bers clash­ing with one another in 17 seats and be­ing un­able to agree on a chief min­is­ter can­di­date, Mr Muhyid­din man­aged to steer GRS to a win.</p>
    <p>The im­passe over the chief min­is­ter’s post had threat­ened to undo GRS’ vic­tory, open­ing the door for ri­val Par ti War is an Sabah (Warisan) to try and form the state govern­ment. But GRS on Mon­day unan­i­mously agreed to go with Mr Muhyid­din’s per­sonal pick.</p>
    <p>Mr Ha­jiji, who was elected as the assem­bly­man for Su­la­man ward for an eighth term last Satur­day, was pre­vi­ously a Sabah state min­is­ter and an Umno chief­tain.</p>
    <p>Bung Mok­tar Radin, the Sabah Umno leader who was to be its chief min­is­ter’s can­di­date, was in­stead made one of three Sabah Deputy Chief Min­is­ters and also Works Min­is­ter for the state. The other two Deputy CMs are Jef­frey Kitin­gan, pres­i­dent of the Star party, and Joachim Gun­salam, vice-pres­i­dent of Parti Ber­satu Sabah.</p>
    <p>The Sabah elec­tion was called when for­mer chief min­is­ter Musa Aman at­tempted to form a new state govern­ment in late July, after se­cur­ing 13 de­fec­tions from the Warisan ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Gov­er­nor Juhar opted in­stead to dis­solve the assem­bly and call for fresh polls.</p>
    <p>After the 2018 elec­tion pro­duced a hung assem­bly, Tan Sri Musa ini­tially se­cured a thin ma­jor­ity and was sworn in, be­fore Mr Shafie se­cured a big­ger tranche of de­fec­tions and was sub­se­quently sworn in two days later.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen if the state can see some po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity after the tur­moil of the past two years.</p>
    <p>With 38 seats on their side to Warisan’s 32, GRS and its al­lies do not have a huge mar­gin, and it re­mains to be seen what the work­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween PN and Umno-led BN in Sabah will be.</p>
    <p>The ten­sions be­tween PN and BN were pal­pa­ble on elec­tion night, with both par­ties cel­e­brat­ing the win at dif­fer­ent com­mand cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, BN is part of the PN fed­eral govern­ment in Pu­tra­jaya.</p>
    <p>Since Mr Ha­jiji’s se­lec­tion, top BN lead­ers have made public state­ments say­ing they were re­luc­tant in giv­ing up the post to PN and in­di­cated that they would not con­tinue to be ac­com­mo­dat­ing to PN’s chief party Ber­satu, which is led by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>The con­flict is play­ing out even as Datuk Seri An­war last week claimed that he had se­cured enough de­fec­tions to top­ple Mr Muhyid­din’s fed­eral govern­ment.</p>
