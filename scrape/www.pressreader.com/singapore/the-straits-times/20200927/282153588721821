    <p>SOCHI Run­away For­mula One se­ries leader Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes emerged from a “hor­ri­ble” red-flagged qual­i­fy­ing ses­sion at Sochi yes­ter­day with pole po­si­tion for to­day’s Rus­sian Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>The six-time cham­pion clocked a best lap in 1min 31.304sec to out­pace Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen by half a sec­ond. His team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas was third-quick­est, with Ser­gio Perez of Rac­ing Point shar­ing the sec­ond row.</p>
    <p>Hamilton is bid­ding to claim his fifth win at the Sochi track where Mercedes have dom­i­nated, win­ning all six races since 2014. If he trans­lates pole into vic­tory, he will equal Michael Schu­macher’s ca­reer record of 91 Grand Prix wins.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s sec­ond ses­sion was in­ter­rupted for 10 min­utes af­ter Se­bas­tian Vet­tel crashed in his Fer­rari. He was un­hurt.</p>
    <p>Re­plays showed that the Ger­man driver clipped a kerb at Turn Four and l ost con­trol as he smacked into the bar­ri­ers. The red flags came out with Hamilton in a per­ilous 15th place with just over two min­utes re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “It was one of the worst qual­i­fy­ing ses­sions. It was hor­ri­ble – heart in your mouth. I wanted to stay out and do a banker but they said come in and get new tyres and then the red flag came out. It was a risk, we got through but I am start­ing on softs which is not good.</p>
    <p>“Un­doubt­edly I am likely to get dragged past to­mor­row, it will make it hard to win the race.”</p>
    <p>Once Q2 even­tu­ally re­sumed Hamilton man­aged to put in the fourth-quick­est time to get through to the top 10 shoot-out.</p>
    <p>The pole was the 96th of Hamilton’s ca­reer but he ended the ses­sion un­der a stew­ards’ en­quiry, along with three other driv­ers, for not re­turn­ing to the track in the cor­rect man­ner at Turn Two.</p>
    <p>No fur­ther ac­tion was taken af­ter the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen, mean­while, felt that Red Bull were “strug­gling a bit” to find the right bal­ance with the car.</p>
    <p>“Even this morn­ing I was not en­tirely happy and in Q2 we were re­ally try­ing to nail the bal­ance but in Q3, the fi­nal runs, it was not bad. To be sec­ond on the grid, so very pleased for that,” he said.</p>
    <p>To­day’s race is due to be watched by the big­gest sport­ing crowd in the Covid-19 era, with 30,000 fans al­lowed to at­tend.</p>
    <p>F1 con­firmed on Friday that there were seven coro­n­avirus cases dis­cov­ered within the sport af­ter 3,256 tests from Sept 18-24.</p>
    <p>Race day: Sing­tel TV Ch114 & StarHub Ch208, 6pm</p>
