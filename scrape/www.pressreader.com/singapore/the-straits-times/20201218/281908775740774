    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Al­pha­bet Inc’s Google, al­ready fac­ing law­suits by the US Jus­tice De­part­ment and var­i­ous state at­tor­neys-gen­eral led by Texas, was ex­pected to be sued for anti-com­pet­i­tive be­hav­iour yes­ter­day by an­other group of at­tor­neysgen­eral, ac­cord­ing to two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Like the Jus­tice De­part­ment com­plaint brought in Oc­to­ber, this group of at least 36 state and ter­ri­tory at­tor­neys-gen­eral, which is bi­par­ti­san, will ac­cuse Google of vi­o­lat­ing an­titrust law to main­tain its dom­i­nance of on­line search.</p>
    <p>The new law­suit will al­lege that Google favoured its own prod­ucts rather than pre­sent­ing a neu­tral search re­sult, dis­ad­van­tag­ing ri­vals to such Google sub­sidiaries as YouTube, said the sources.</p>
    <p>They added that the com­plaint is ex­pected to touch on how Google is us­ing anti-com­pet­i­tive con­duct to grow its mar­ket power in emerg­ing prod­uct ar­eas, such as home smart speak­ers as well as soft­ware for cars and TVs.</p>
    <p>The Texas suit, which was filed on Wed­nes­day and joined by nine other states, fo­cuses on Google’s on­line ad­ver­tis­ing tech­nol­ogy. It says Google and Face­book used a se­ries of deals to il­le­gally con­sol­i­date their mar­ket power.</p>
    <p>Google and Face­book com­pete heav­ily in In­ter­net ad sales, to­gether cap­tur­ing more than half of the global mar­ket. The two play­ers agreed in a pub­li­cised deal in 2018 to start giv­ing Face­book’s ad­ver­tiser clients the op­tion to place ads within Google’s net­work of pub­lish­ing part­ners, the suit al­leges.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a sneaker blog that uses soft­ware from Google to sell ads could end up gen­er­at­ing rev­enue from a footwear re­tailer that bought ads on Face­book.</p>
    <p>But what Google did not an­nounce pub­licly is that it gave Face­book pref­er­en­tial treat­ment, ac­cord­ing to the com­plaint.</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, the se­ries of ac­tions could re­sult in Google pay­ing fines, drop­ping out of busi­nesses or re­struc­tur­ing its long­stand­ing deals with part­ners.</p>
