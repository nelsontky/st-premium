    <p>MOSCOW Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin yes­ter­day be­stowed a US$1.5 bil­lion (S$2.04 bil­lion) loan on Belarus after its em­bat­tled leader Alexan­der Lukashenko en­treated his pa­tron for more sup­port.</p>
    <p>A day after more than 100,000 pro­test­ers took to the streets of Minsk for the fifth straight weekend to de­mand his re­moval, Mr Lukashenko, who has led Rus­sia’s clos­est ally for 26 years, flew to the Black Sea re­sort of Sochi to ask Mr Putin for help.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to an­nounc­ing the loan, the Rus­sian Pres­i­dent sig­nalled sup­port for Mr Lukashenko in other ways, say­ing de­fence co­op­er­a­tion would con­tinue be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Rus­sian news agen­cies re­ported that Moscow was send­ing para­troop­ers yes­ter­day for joint ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin also backed plans that Mr Lukashenko had pre­vi­ously an­nounced for con­sti­tu­tional re­form – which the op­po­si­tion has dis­missed as a stunt to cling to power after an elec­tion it says was rigged – and said it was up to Be­laru­sians to re­solve the crisis them­selves.</p>
    <p>De­spite in­creas­ingly ag­gres­sive ac­tion from his se­cu­rity forces, Mr Lukashenko has failed to re­claim the streets from demon­stra­tors, who taunted him in the tens of thou­sands on Sun­day with chants of “You’re a rat!”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko calls the demon­stra­tions a Western plot and has</p>
    <p>placed his fate i n Moscow’s hands, re­quest­ing eco­nomic sup­port and mil­i­tary aid.</p>
    <p>Since the Aug 9 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, which he de­nies rig­ging, thou­sands of peo­ple have been ar­rested and nearly all the op­po­si­tion’s main lead­ers have been ei­ther j ailed, de­ported or forced into ex­ile.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said they de­tained 774 peo­ple at Sun­day’s protests.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion says it fears Mr Lukashenko could try to sell out Be­laru­sian in­de­pen­dence for Mr Putin’s sup­port.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions hu­man rights chief said yes­ter­day her of­fice was re­ceiv­ing “alarm­ing re­ports” of the on­go­ing vi­o­lent re­pres­sion of peace­ful demon­stra­tions in Belarus.</p>
    <p>“Re­ports con­tinue to in­di­cate un­nec­es­sary or ex­ces­sive use of force by law en­force­ment of­fi­cials,” UN High Com­mis­sioner for Hu­man Rights Michelle Bachelet told a coun­cil meet­ing in Geneva.</p>
    <p>The UN Hu­man Rights Coun­cil added fur­ther pres­sure on Belarus yes­ter­day by agree­ing to hold an ur­gent de­bate on the hu­man rights sit­u­a­tion in the coun­try.</p>
