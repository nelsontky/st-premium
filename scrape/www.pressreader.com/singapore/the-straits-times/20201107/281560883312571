    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia plans to boost its Covid-19 war chest by rais­ing its ceil­ing by as much as RM20 bil­lion to RM65 bil­lion (S$21.2 bil­lion), Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fund will be used to deal with the pan­demic, in­clud­ing to fi­nance a stim­u­lus pack­age, pro­vide aid to peo­ple, meet front-line work­ers’ needs and pro­cure vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day re­ported 1,755 new coro­n­avirus cases, the high­est daily rise since the pan­demic was tracked in Malaysia in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“The war is not over un­til and un­less an af­ford­able and ac­ces­si­ble vac­cine is avail­able,” Datuk Seri Zafrul said in his Bud­get 2021 speech. “The gov­ern­ment is com­mit­ted to ob­tain­ing Covid-19 vac­cines through its par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess pro­gramme, or Covax,” he said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion needs are es­ti­mated to cost more than RM3 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>To aid those di­rectly fight­ing the pan­demic, some 100,000 med­i­cal front-lin­ers from the Health Min­istry will re­ceive a one-off pay­ment of RM500, on top of a monthly al­lowance of RM600 at present.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of RM475 mil­lion will be al­lo­cated for the pur­chase of reagent sup­plies, test kits and con­sum­ables for the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some RM318 mil­lion will be set aside for per­sonal pro­tec­tion equip­ment (PPE) and hand sani­tis­ers for front-lin­ers, while RM150 mil­lion will be al­lo­cated to the Na­tional Dis­as­ter Man­age­ment Agency.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment will boost aid to over 400,000 house­holds liv­ing be­low the poverty line. House­holds with a monthly in­come of less than RM2,500 will get a one-off pay­ment of RM1,200 to RM1,800, and those with a monthly i ncome of RM2,501 to RM4,000 will re­ceive RM800 to RM1,200.</p>
