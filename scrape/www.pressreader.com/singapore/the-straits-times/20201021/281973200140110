    <p>The rec­om­men­da­tions last week by the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil (NWC) to em­ploy­ers on tem­po­rary wage cuts to pro­tect jobs, and to be re­spon­si­ble and sen­si­tive if re­trench­ing staff, point to the dif­fi­cult times ahead which com­pa­nies need to nav­i­gate care­fully. The coun­cil said that the amount of the cuts should de­pend on a sec­tor’s and a com­pany’s outlook, and that em­ploy­ees should be told how the wages will be re­stored even­tu­ally. Also, em­ploy­ers should use the an­nual and monthly vari­able com­po­nents to ad­just wages. They should cut ba­sic pay only if it is re­ally nec­es­sary to avoid re­trench­ments. Th­ese rec­om­men­da­tions go be­yond the NWC’s ear­lier em­pha­sis on re­duc­ing non-wage costs first.</p>
    <p>Clearly, the con­tin­u­ing eco­nomic down­turn has made it nec­es­sary for the coun­cil to sug­gest a stronger, and in­deed a sig­nif­i­cant, al­ter­na­tive to re­trench­ments than cut­ting non-wage costs. Should that al­ter­na­tive prove to be in­suf­fi­cient, a tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on man­ag­ing ex­cess man­power and re­spon­si­ble re­trench­ment has called on em­ploy­ers to use ob­jec­tive cri­te­ria, such as abil­ity, ex­pe­ri­ence and skills, should they need to re­trench work­ers. They should also lean to­wards re­tain­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans, while recog­nis­ing the im­por­tance of per­ma­nent res­i­dents in their work­force. When busi­ness picks up, em­ploy­ers should look care­fully at strength­en­ing their lo­cal work­force by hir­ing lo­cals when they are able to do so.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether, th­ese rec­om­men­da­tions rep­re­sent three as­cend­ing lev­els of the busi­ness re­sponse to the re­ces­sion: the cut­ting of non-wage costs, then wage costs, and then jobs them­selves. The sug­ges­tions re­flect the se­ri­ous­ness of the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion. The first six months of 2020 saw 11,350 re­trench­ments, and those might well be the be­gin­ning of a pe­riod of job cuts that will hew a painful swathe through the liv­ing stan­dards of many Sin­ga­pore­ans. Af­ter the Gov­ern­ment’s life­lines to work­ers and busi­nesses in the form of wage sub­si­dies are re­moved even­tu­ally, busi­ness will con­front the full force of a mar­ket where the re­lent­less laws of sup­ply and de­mand will de­ter­mine which work­ers and com­pa­nies sur­vive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ame­lio­ra­tive mea­sures, par­tic­u­larly for lower-in­come earn­ers, wo­ven into the lat­est rec­om­men­da­tions should help to buf­fer Sin­ga­porean work­ers in the un­fold­ing down­turn. Lowwage work­ers are af­forded a de­gree of pro­tec­tion by the rec­om­men­da­tion that those earn­ing up to $1,400 in ba­sic wage each month have their wages frozen in­stead of be­ing cut, and that se­nior man­agers take deeper cuts. The au­thor­i­ties clearly are try­ing to en­sure that the re­sponse to the down­turn is cal­i­brated and that the most vul­ner­a­ble can sur­vive the de­cline in earn­ings while al­low­ing the econ­omy to re­cover in time. Clearly, as the on­go­ing pan­demic un­folds, ev­ery­one should brace for dif­fi­cult days ahead.</p>
