    <p>Will they, or won’t they? For many years, the United States and its al­lies have won­dered whether the blos­som­ing friend­ship be­tween Rus­sia and China will ul­ti­mately re­sult in a full al­liance be­tween the two.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts dis­miss this Sino-Rus­sian al­liance’s prospect as just a scare­crow of­ten trot­ted out by Bei­jing and Moscow when­ever one or both needed to scare the West. Other an­a­lysts, how­ever, have taken mat­ters more se­ri­ously, ar­gu­ing that Western govern­ments need to pay at­ten­tion to the China-Rus­sia tan­dem.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ev­ery­one agrees on one point: The re­la­tion­ship be­tween Bei­jing and Moscow has the po­ten­tial to up­end most strate­gic cal­cu­la­tions in both Asia and Europe, across both the</p>
    <p>Pa­cific and the At­lantic.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral dis­parate re­cent events have rekin­dled this de­bate.</p>
    <p>The first was an enig­matic state­ment Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin made back in Oc­to­ber at a brain­storm­ing sem­i­nar he holds ev­ery year with hand­picked se­nior of­fi­cials, aca­demics and think-tankers.</p>
    <p>Asked dur­ing the event whether Rus­sia should pon­der con­clud­ing a mil­i­tary al­liance with China – the sort of topic Mr Putin usu­ally avoids talk­ing about in public – he was this time quite spe­cific. “We have not set that goal for our­selves”, he said. “But, in prin­ci­ple, we are not go­ing to rule it out, ei­ther,” he added.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing, which used to be equally tight-lipped about such mat­ters, is also sud­denly pre­pared to dis­cuss the pos­si­bil­ity. “The more tur­bu­lent the world be­comes, the more sta­ble China-Rus­sia re­la­tions should be,” Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi is re­ported to have told his Rus­sian coun­ter­part Sergei Lavrov dur­ing a phone con­ver­sa­tion last week.</p>
    <p>Nor is the mes­sag­ing con­fined to words alone. For just be­fore Christ­mas, Rus­sian and Chi­nese fighter jets held what both coun­tries re­ferred to as “joint air strate­gic pa­trols” over the Sea of Ja­pan (also known as the East Sea) and the South China Sea, to the ev­i­dent dis­plea­sure of Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that this sig­nalling is the prod­uct of ner­vous­ness felt in Moscow and Bei­jing about the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion’s poli­cies in the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin’s re­marks were de­liv­ered pre­cisely a week be­fore the US elec­tions. They were in­tended to be no­ticed in Wash­ing­ton. Si­mul­ta­ne­ously, the Chi­nese me­dia has ex­plic­itly pointed out that the air ma­noeu­vres with Rus­sian jets are “de­signed to send a strong sig­nal to the new US govern­ment”, as the Global Times, the</p>
    <p>English-lan­guage tabloid pub­lished by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nity Party, put it.</p>
    <p>So, it may be all pos­tur­ing. Still, the Sino-Rus­sian link is one that Wash­ing­ton will have to con­tinue ob­serv­ing.</p>
    <p>COM­PLE­MEN­TARY RE­LA­TION­SHIP WITH LONG HIS­TORY OF MIS­TRUST</p>
    <p>In the­ory, Rus­sia and China com­ple­ment each other well, and in ev­ery crit­i­cal area. Rus­sia is a vast coun­try with a rel­a­tively small pop­u­la­tion; China’s ter­ri­tory is much smaller, but it has work­force in abun­dance. Rus­sia is pri­mar­ily an ex­porter of oil, gas and other raw ma­te­ri­als; China is the world’s big­gest sin­gle con­sumer of all these com­modi­ties.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter still, Rus­sia’s top man­u­fac­tured ex­ports con­sist mostly of weapons, and China is keen to buy them.</p>
    <p>Then, there is the po­lit­i­cal con­text. Both coun­tries re­sent Amer­ica’s global reach, and both are sub­jected to var­i­ous eco­nomic, fi­nan­cial and tech­no­log­i­cal sanc­tions im­posed by Wash­ing­ton. Fi­nally, both China and Rus­sia lack for­mal al­liance struc­tures that can be mo­bilised to ad­vance Moscow’s or Bei­jing’s in­ter­ests in the way the US does, so</p>
    <p>ac­ti­vat­ing their bi­lat­eral link of­fers them op­por­tu­ni­ties they can­not find else­where.</p>
    <p>Set against this, how­ever, is a long his­tory of mis­trust. For much of the Cold War pe­riod, China and Rus­sia (in the guise of the Soviet Union) were sworn en­e­mies that pe­ri­od­i­cally came to blows and oc­ca­sion­ally con­tem­plated even all-out war. All this has been care­fully air­brushed out of the of­fi­cial his­to­ries pre­vail­ing in Bei­jing and Moscow, but po­lit­i­cal elites in both coun­tries re­main fully aware of the re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>And although the ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes be­tween the two were set­tled after the Cold War and the Soviet Union’s col­lapse, sus­pi­cions lin­gered.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia wanted to re­main the pre­dom­i­nant power in Cen­tral Asia, yet China has usurped its po­si­tion over the past two decades. First, the Chi­nese ap­peared to re­spect a “di­vi­sion of labour” with Rus­sia over the man­age­ment of Cen­tral Asia, with China be­com­ing the top eco­nomic power, and Rus­sia re­mained the key ac­tor with the re­gion’s mil­i­taries and spy­ing agen­cies. But even that in­for­mal di­vi­sion is now in­creas­ingly ig­nored by China.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sians also know that any cut­ting-edge weapon they sell to</p>
    <p>China gets “re­verse en­gi­neered” by the Chi­nese – a more po­lite term for copy­ing – and then sold on as Chi­nese-man­u­fac­tured weapons on global mar­kets. Be­sides, it is only a mat­ter of time be­fore ad­vances in Chi­nese mil­i­tary re­search ren­der Rus­sian weapons dis­pens­able.</p>
    <p>Nor should it be for­got­ten that, de­spite their ex­pres­sions of friend­ship, Chi­nese lead­ers have sel­dom taken Rus­sia se­ri­ously. Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party man­u­als use the col­lapse of the Soviet Union as a warn­ing of what China should avoid. Few Chi­nese bother to learn Rus­sian, and apart from small traders cross­ing Siberia’s bor­ders to sell cheap con­sumer goods, cul­tural links re­main lim­ited.</p>
    <p>In short, this is a trans­ac­tional re­la­tion­ship, with both sides re­main­ing wary of each other. That is why Rus­sian lead­ers have dithered for years about build­ing pipe­lines to de­liver oil and nat­u­ral gas to China, de­spite the Chi­nese mar­ket’s lu­cra­tive na­ture, and con­tin­ued to in­vest in­stead in new pipe­line projects in Europe.</p>
    <p>While en­cour­ag­ing Euro­pean coun­tries to re­main de­pen­dent on Rus­sian en­ergy prod­ucts gives Moscow en­dur­ing in­flu­ence in Europe, if China buys the bulk of</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s en­ergy prod­ucts, it will be Rus­sia that will grow de­pen­dent on Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“Moscow can­not fail to no­tice that in re­cent years, Bei­jing has ac­quired a taste for us­ing eco­nomic weapons such as sanc­tions, em­bar­goes and tar­iffs to ap­ply pressure to other coun­tries, as il­lus­trated by the trade war cur­rently rag­ing be­tween China and Aus­tralia,” Mr Alexan­der Gabuev, who heads the Rus­sia and Asia-Pa­cific re­search pro­gramme at the Carnegie Moscow Cen­tre, noted re­cently.</p>
    <p>CO­OP­ER­A­TION IN CRU­CIAL AR­EAS</p>
    <p>Still, the link be­tween Moscow and Bei­jing can be­come a ma­jor headache for the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion and, in­deed, for the Euro­peans as well.</p>
    <p>For it is wrong to look at the nexus be­tween Rus­sia and China in zero-sum terms. Although</p>
    <p>China and Rus­sia may never forge a mil­i­tary al­liance of the sort the US has in Europe, or in Asia with coun­tries such as Ja­pan or South Korea, Bei­jing and Moscow can and will co­op­er­ate on cru­cial ar­eas that im­pinge on Amer­i­can strate­gic in­ter­ests; the prob­lem is there­fore not one of con­fronting a new Sino-Rus­sian al­liance, but more of work­ing out what ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion are likely to emerge.</p>
    <p>One ev­i­dent area of co­op­er­a­tion is in in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions. China does not recog­nise Rus­sia’s an­nex­a­tion of Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Still, ear­lier this month, China voted against a United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly res­o­lu­tion urg­ing Rus­sia to va­cate that Ukrainian ter­ri­tory. The Chi­nese and Rus­sian am­bas­sadors of­ten cover each other in the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil and other spe­cialised UN in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>The two are also in­creas­ingly – if more mod­estly – co­or­di­nat­ing their po­si­tions in the Mid­dle East, an area where Rus­sia now has a sig­nif­i­cant mil­i­tary pres­ence.</p>
    <p>And although Rus­sia is care­ful not to get in­volved in key ar­eas of Chi­nese con­cern, Moscow is in­creas­ingly of­fer­ing ver­bal sup­port to Bei­jing. Mr Lavrov, for in­stance, re­cently blamed the West for al­legedly “fo­ment­ing” trou­ble be­tween China and In­dia, a cu­ri­ous in­ter­pre­ta­tion of events that ev­i­dently plays well in Bei­jing but does not go too far in an­noy­ing the In­di­ans, who also re­main a ma­jor cus­tomer of Rus­sian weapons.</p>
    <p>There is also a high like­li­hood that Africa could be­come a new area of co­op­er­a­tion. The Chi­nese al­ready have a naval base there, and the Rus­sians are plan­ning on es­tab­lish­ing two, in Su­dan and Libya, which could serve Chi­nese in­ter­ests very well.</p>
    <p>So, no Nato-style al­liance is in the off­ing, but plenty of strate­gic tie-ups in­tended to in­crease the cost the US will have to pay.</p>
    <p>PIT­FALLS TO AVOID</p>
    <p>Still, the Bi­den pres­i­dency is not bereft of op­tions, pro­vided it is care­ful about avoid­ing sev­eral pit­falls.</p>
    <p>It should avoid air­ing in public fears about the po­ten­tial Rus­sia-China tie-up, for the more Wash­ing­ton ap­pears to be scared about this prospect, the more both Bei­jing and Moscow will have a stake in tout­ing their friend­ship.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, who ar­gues that Europe should ac­com­mo­date Rus­sia to avoid a Rus­sian-Chi­nese al­liance is dead wrong, and his mis­take should not be re­peated in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would have to be aware that an en­gage­ment with both China and Rus­sia is re­quired, and that the two en­gage­ment pro­cesses can­not be al­lowed to move too far out of sync.</p>
    <p>For this rea­son alone, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s at­tempt to con­di­tion nu­clear arms control talks with Rus­sia on Rus­sian help in get­ting China to join these ne­go­ti­a­tions was a mis­take and one that should be dis­carded.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, the best guide to fu­ture US pol­icy on this mat­ter is at­ten­tion to de­tail and in­spi­ra­tion from the les­son first offered by 19th-century Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter, Lord Palmer­ston, who ob­served that coun­tries do not have en­dur­ing friend­ships, just per­pet­ual in­ter­ests.</p>
