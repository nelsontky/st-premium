    <p>Along with tales of de­s­pair in a pan­demic year, there have also been sto­ries that give hope — such as that of Mr Samuel Peh, 26.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (SIT) un­der­grad­u­ate and for­mer ath­lete was just 19 when a de­bil­i­tat­ing knee con­di­tion forced him to take a break from sports.</p>
    <p>“I was very ac­tive in bas­ket­ball and other sports dur­ing my sec­ondary school and In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) days. I would par­tic­i­pate in com­pe­ti­tions and spent count­less hours train­ing to im­prove my abil­i­ties on the court,” he says.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, that re­sulted in patel­lar ten­donitis (also known as jumper’s knee), which is caused by over­strain­ing and char­ac­terised by an in­flam­ma­tion of the kneecap. Told by his or­thopaedic doc­tor not to par­tic­i­pate in stren­u­ous ac­tiv­i­ties, he had to sit help­lessly on the side­lines, while his team­mates played on.</p>
    <p>The per­son that helped him get back on his feet was his phys­io­ther­a­pist, whom he says “changed my life”. Mr Peh cred­its him, not just for play­ing a huge role in his re­cov­ery, but also for mak­ing him in­trigued about how the hu­man body works, which led to a new call­ing — phys­io­ther­apy.</p>
    <p>New pur­pose in life</p>
    <p>Mr Peh knew his re­sults from ITE were not enough to score a place at a polytech­nic. So he de­cided to get some hands-on ex­pe­ri­ence first to learn more about the com­mu­nity care sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Af­ter na­tional ser­vice, he en­rolled in a ther­apy sup­port course to gain more knowl­edge about re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion. Upon com­ple­tion of the course, he started work at St Andrew’s Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal as a ther­apy as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>“( Working there) was an eye-open­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. What struck me was how com­fort­able</p>
    <p>I felt in­ter­act­ing with the se­niors.” he says.</p>
    <p>“There’s never a dull day as a health­care worker. Ev­ery day is filled with chal­lenges that mould me as a per­son and new op­por­tu­ni­ties to meet pa­tients from dif­fer­ent walks of life. It was then that I set my mind to help the el­derly in the com­mu­nity care sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>Pick­ing up crit­i­cal skills</p>
    <p>In 2017, Mr Peh was ac­cepted into Re­pub­lic Polytech­nic’s Diploma in Health Man­age­ment and Pro­mo­tion course, which equipped him with the aca­demic knowl­edge as well as crit­i­cal think­ing, prob­lem solv­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills that would later prove use­ful in univer­sity.</p>
    <p>A re­cip­i­ent of the Com­mu­nity Care Schol­ar­ship from MOH Hold­ings (MOHH), Mr Peh is cur­rently pur­su­ing a Bach­e­lor of Sci­ence (Hon­ours) in phys­io­ther­apy at SIT. One of his most mem­o­rable ex­pe­ri­ences as an un­der­grad­u­ate was at­tend­ing a three-day camp last year — which took place on­line due to Covid19 re­stric­tions — where he and other par­tic­i­pants had in­sight­ful shar­ing ses­sions about the fu­ture of Sin­ga­pore’s health­care in­dus­try and so­ci­ety as a whole.</p>
    <p>De­spite these times of un­cer­tainty, Mr Peh strives to stay fo­cused on his goal — to serve the com­mu­nity. “The pan­demic serves as a test for us to re­main vig­i­lant and stead­fast when it comes to our health­care sys­tem. This is so that we can con­tinue to sup­port and care for our se­niors well amid the chal­lenges.”</p>

    <p>An ath­letic in­jury led to a fas­ci­na­tion with the field of phys­io­ther­apy for Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy un­der­grad­u­ate Samuel Peh.</p>
