    <p>About 400 com­pa­nies are be­ing scru­ti­nised by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­nat­ing against Sin­ga­pore­ans in their hir­ing.</p>
    <p>These em­ploy­ers, which make up the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch list, have a higher share of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) com­pared with their in­dus­try peers, or a high con­cen­tra­tion of em­ploy­ees from a sin­gle for­eign na­tion­al­ity source, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses on the watch list have their ap­pli­ca­tions for Em­ploy­ment Passes de­layed or re­jected un­til they buck up.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep) will help them im­prove their hu­man re­source prac­tices.</p>
    <p>No Te­masek-linked com­pa­nies have been put on the watch list, Mrs Teo said. And the rea­son is not that they were given any spe­cial con­ces­sion or treat­ment, but be­cause the proac­tive sur­veil­lance the min­istry car­ried out did not pick them up, she added.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was re­ply­ing to Work­ers’ Party MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC).</p>
    <p>About 10 MPs asked about ef­forts to en­sure fair em­ploy­ment for Sin­ga­pore­ans, in­clud­ing some who, Mrs Teo said, had al­ready filed ques­tions on the topic for the next Par­lia­ment sit­ting, which is ex­pected to be next month.</p>
    <p>The topic was also in­tensely cov­ered in the five-day de­bate this week on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that af­ter Tafep in­ter­venes, many com­pa­nies exit the watch list within a year. But they con­tinue to be watched and will be put back on the watch list if they re­vert to their old pat­terns of hir­ing and have a skewed work­force pro­file.</p>
    <p>Of the 1,200 firms scru­ti­nised since 2016, less than 10 per cent were un­co­op­er­a­tive and have had their work pass priv­i­leges sus­pended, mean­ing they can­not hire for­eign­ers. They re­main on the watch list.</p>
    <p>She fur­ther said that while MOM is step­ping up en­force­ment ef­forts to en­sure fair hir­ing, it does not in­tend to name the com­pa­nies on the watch list – which some MPs have called for.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is that MOM’s goal is to get com­pa­nies to do bet­ter in their hir­ing of lo­cal PMETs, not to frus­trate them till they leave Sin­ga­pore or close down, which would af­fect all their ex­ist­ing lo­cal work­ers as well, she added.</p>
    <p>“The ac­tions that we take must be pro­por­tional, and it must also not cre­ate so much dif­fi­cul­ties for the ex­ist­ing PMETs in their work­force, who are lo­cal and would very much like to keep their jobs.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo also told the House that her min­istry will con­tinue to look at bet­ter ways to quickly iden­tify, with­out mis­take, pos­si­ble dis­crim­i­na­tory com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>She stressed that the com­pa­nies on the watch list have not flouted any rules.</p>
    <p>They were picked up through scru­tiny of their work­force com­po­si­tion and how they have re­sponded to ap­pli­cants for jobs posted on the MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg por­tal.</p>
    <p>She made the point when re­ply­ing to Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC), who had sug­gested us­ing a “mys­tery shop­per” ap­proach to test whether com­pa­nies have a clear pat­tern of re­ject­ing cer­tain ap­pli­ca­tions even at the early stage of pe­rus­ing their re­sume.</p>
    <p>The min­istry’s “proac­tive sur­veil­lance” has un­cov­ered more com­pa­nies than com­plaints have, she added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo also cau­tioned against al­ways as­sum­ing em­ploy­ers are not try­ing to do their part, have some­thing to hide and do not face any dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers have said they run into very se­ri­ous chal­lenges in reach­ing out to po­ten­tial job seek­ers, she added.</p>
    <p>“So, we have to take a bal­anced ap­proach and ask our­selves, what is the com­bi­na­tion of ac­tions that will be most help­ful to the busi­nesses, which, in turn, will be more help­ful in ex­pand­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for our own peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Her min­istry is con­stantly try­ing to strike that bal­ance, she said.</p>
