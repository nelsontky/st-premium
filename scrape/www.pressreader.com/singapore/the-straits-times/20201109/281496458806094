    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den called for unity on Satur­day night, ap­peal­ing to Amer­i­cans, in­clud­ing those who did not vote for him, to come to­gether and be­gin the process of heal­ing.</p>
    <p>“I pledge to be a pres­i­dent who seeks not to di­vide but unify, who doesn’t see red states or blue states, but only sees the United States,” he said in a vic­tory speech de­liv­ered out­side the Chase Cen­tre in his home­town of Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware, in his first re­marks as Pres­i­dent-elect.</p>
    <p>Get­ting Covid-19 un­der con­trol in the US, where the virus has claimed nearly 240,000 lives and more than 100,000 new cases are be­ing re­ported each day, will be Mr Bi­den’s top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>He has also claimed a man­date to se­cure health­care for Amer­i­cans, achieve racial jus­tice and ad­dress cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said in a speech that fo­cused heav­ily on themes of rec­on­cil­i­a­tion and hope that he will an­nounce his own task force to deal with the pan­demic today, be­fore even nam­ing his Cab­i­net.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent and long-time Delaware sen­a­tor was de­clared the win­ner on Satur­day morn­ing, after a hotly con­tested and oc­ca­sion­ally ran­corous pres­i­den­tial election that un­der­scored Amer­ica’s deep divi­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has amassed 290 elec­toral votes, more than the 270 needed for vic­tory, noted the As­so­ci­ated Press, which has called Ari­zona for him, though not all me­dia out­lets have done so.</p>
    <p>Count­ing con­tin­ued in the swing state of Ge­or­gia, where Mr Bi­den’s lead had in­creased to 10,000 votes by yes­ter­day morn­ing. Win­ning</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gia would bring him to 306 elec­toral votes, more than the 304 net­ted by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in 2016.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has not con­ceded the race and re­mained largely silent on Satur­day, ex­cept for a pair of tweets in which he de­cried the election re­sult as man­u­fac­tured. He re­peated base­less al­le­ga­tions of voter fraud yes­ter­day. “I won the election, got 71,000,000 le­gal votes,” he wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has 75.2 mil­lion votes and count­ing.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers from around the world con­grat­u­lated Mr Bi­den on his win, although Amer­ica’s top trad­ing part­ner Mex­ico no­tably ab­stained.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong wrote on Face­book that Sin­ga­pore looked for­ward to work­ing with the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to deepen the part­ner­ship be­tween both coun­tries, en­hance Amer­ica’s role in the Asia-Pa­cific, and over­come Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“You can count on Sin­ga­pore to re­main a friend and part­ner,” said PM Lee.</p>
