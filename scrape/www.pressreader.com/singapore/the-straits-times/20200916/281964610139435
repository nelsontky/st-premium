    <p>• The United States came close to nu­clear war with North Korea in 2017, launch­ing a pre­ci­sion mis­sile to demon­strate to Pyongyang that it could strike any tar­get, in­clud­ing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, ac­cord­ing to a new book by Wash­ing­ton Post jour­nal­ist Bob Wood­ward.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Pyongyang test-fir­ing its first in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­sile (ICBM) ca­pa­ble of reach­ing the US on July 4, 2017, re­tired gen­eral Vin­cent Brooks, who headed US Forces Korea from 2016 to 2018, or­dered troops to fire a tac­ti­cal mis­sile that trav­elled 300km be­fore drop­ping into the East Sea, also known as Sea of Ja­pan, ac­cord­ing to Mr Wood­ward’s Rage, a book about the pres­i­dency of Mr Don­ald Trump set for re­lease yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“That was the ex­act dis­tance be­tween the launch­ing point of the US mis­sile and the North Korean mis­sile test site, as well as a tent where satel­lite pho­tos showed Kim Jong Un was watch­ing the mis­sile launch,” Mr Wood­ward wrote, ac­cord­ing to ex­cerpts ob­tained by Yonhap News Agency.</p>
    <p>“The mean­ing was meant to be clear: Kim Jong Un needed to worry about his per­sonal safety,” Mr Wood­ward said, adding that it was never con­firmed whether the North got the mes­sage.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing its ICBM test, the North upped provo­ca­tions, launch­ing a more pow­er­ful ICBM on July 28 and an­other bal­lis­tic mis­sile over Ja­pan on Aug 29, which Mr Wood­ward de­scribed as a “clear es­ca­la­tion” that “changed the char­ac­ter of the threat”.</p>
    <p>Then US De­fence Sec­re­tary James Mat­tis mulled over whether the US should carry out a mil­i­tary attack in re­sponse, but re­con­sid­ered it due to the con­se­quences such a move would likely en­tail.</p>
    <p>“(Mat­tis) be­gan look­ing for more ag­gres­sive re­sponse op­tions and won­dered if they should take some ac­tual bomb­ing ac­tion in a North Korean port to send the mes­sage,” Mr Wood­ward said. “(Mat­tis) did not think that Pres­i­dent (Don­ald) Trump would launch a pre-emp­tive strike on North Korea, al­though plans for such a war were on the shelf.”</p>
    <p>With the es­ca­la­tion of provo­ca­tions in 2017, Mr Trump’s na­tional se­cu­rity team also be­lieved the po­ten­tial for nu­clear war with the North was there.</p>
    <p>“We never knew whether it was real or whether it was a bluff,” US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo is quoted as say­ing in the book.</p>
    <p>Mr Mat­tis even slept in his clothes so that he would be ready in case of a provo­ca­tion by the North and went to the nearby Wash­ing­ton Na­tional Cathe­dral to pray, Mr Wood­ward re­ported.</p>
    <p>He said the US Strate­gic Com­mand in Omaha, Nebraska, had care­fully re­viewed Op­er­a­tion Plan 5027 – the war plans in case of a North Korean in­va­sion – which in­cluded “the use of 80 nu­clear weapons”.</p>
    <p>“This weighed heav­ily on me ev­ery day. I had to con­sider ev­ery day this could hap­pen. This was not a the­o­ret­i­cal con­cern,” Mr Mat­tis was quoted as say­ing, rais­ing con­cern that “the worst pos­si­ble sit­u­a­tion might dic­tate the use of nu­clear weapons”.</p>
    <p>For the book, Mr Wood­ward – a two-time Pulitzer Prize win­ner who is best known for un­cov­er­ing the Water­gate scan­dal – con­ducted 18 in­ter­views with Mr Trump be­tween last De­cem­ber and July.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing one of the in­ter­views, Mr Trump told Mr Wood­ward that Wash­ing­ton came closer to war with Pyongyang than any­one can imag­ine in 2017.</p>
    <p>“Much closer than any­one would know. Much closer,” Mr Trump said, in­sist­ing that Mr Kim, too, must have known. “But he knows. I have a great re­la­tion­ship, let me just put it that way.”</p>
