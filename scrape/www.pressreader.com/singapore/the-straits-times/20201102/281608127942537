    <p>Four new coron­avirus in­fec­tions were con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,019.</p>
    <p>They were all im­ported cases and had been placed on stay­home no­tices, and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>No cases in the com­mu­nity or from within dor­mi­to­ries were an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The four im­ported cases in­clude two per­ma­nent res­i­dents – a 37-year-old man back from In­dia and a 51-year-old woman who re­turned from Bri­tain. She had on­set of symp­toms on Oct 23.</p>
    <p>The other two pa­tients are em­ployed here. One is a 32-yearold male Dutch work pass holder who ar­rived from the Nether­lands; the other is a 31-year-old fe­male Filipino work per­mit holder who ar­rived from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>All four tested pos­i­tive last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The MOH said only two cases of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion have been recorded in the past week. The in­fec­tions are not linked.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals and com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties dis­charged 11 pa­tients yes­ter­day, bring­ing to 57,909 the num­ber of peo­ple who have fully re­cov­ered from the virus.</p>
    <p>There were 46 pa­tients in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day – none in in­ten­sive care – while 21 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
