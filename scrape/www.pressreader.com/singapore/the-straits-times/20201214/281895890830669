    <p>In a pan­demic, trust is ev­ery­thing. Bei­jing and Moscow saw early the po­ten­tial ben­e­fits of pulling ahead in the race to pro­duce an ef­fec­tive in­oc­u­la­tion against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Apart from the pub­lic health ben­e­fits and the keen aware­ness in both gov­ern­ments of the need to be self-re­liant, a clear win would val­i­date top-down mod­els of govern­ment and in­no­va­tion. It would also mean a much-needed im­age boost, at home and abroad.</p>
    <p>In the end, both have had suc­cess. Moscow in Au­gust, to great fan­fare, be­came the first to grant reg­u­la­tory ap­proval for a vac­cine, one of its two lead­ing can­di­dates. By then, Bei­jing had al­lowed doses of one of its own vac­cines to be given to its mil­i­tary. About a fifth of all shots listed by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) as un­der­go­ing clin­i­cal tri­als are Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>Yet with­out more transparen­cy about re­search and test­ing – and a lit­tle less pro­pa­ganda – nei­ther coun­try will earn the con­fi­dence needed to reap the full re­ward.</p>
    <p>For an in­di­ca­tion of the trust deficit, look at the way the mar­ket re­sponded to Rus­sia’s green light for its Sput­nik V vac­cine, or to news that the flag­ship vac­cine is more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>They were yawns com­pared with the un­bri­dled en­thu­si­asm af­ter Moderna Ther­a­peu­tics pub­lished en­cour­ag­ing data in</p>
    <p>July, or in­deed on­go­ing ex­cite­ment as the vac­cine from Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech goes through the United States’ reg­u­la­tory ap­proval process.</p>
    <p>Last month, pos­i­tive re­sults for the Pfizer in­oc­u­la­tion from a large-scale clin­i­cal trial were enough to push the S&P 500, MSCI World and MSCI All World in­dexes to­wards record highs, in no small part thanks to ro­bust ev­i­dence about the vac­cine’s ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>China faced a higher trust hur­dle from the start. It saw the first cases of the dis­ease, and there were ques­tions from the ear­li­est days of the out­break over how swiftly it had shared in­for­ma­tion, perhaps miss­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to slow the spread.</p>
    <p>Even if it was not a re­peat of 2002 and 2003, when Bei­jing took months to dis­close the out­break of se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome, wari­ness lin­gered.</p>
    <p>Then there’s the im­pact of past vac­cine scan­dals, most re­cently over sub­stan­dard in­oc­u­la­tions in</p>
    <p>2018. Con­trols have been over­hauled since.</p>
    <p>It’s no ac­ci­dent that Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro – no stranger to mix­ing health pol­icy and the de­mands of pop­ulist pol­i­tics – in Oc­to­ber crit­i­cised the Si­no­vac Biotech vac­cine be­ing tested in his coun­try by ar­gu­ing that peo­ple didn’t feel safe “be­cause of its ori­gin”. In cir­cum­stances that have baf­fled lo­cal re­searchers, the fi­nal-phase trial has since been sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s plight has not been too dif­fer­ent. The coun­try has not been a vac­cine re­search or pro­duc­tion pow­er­house, but an in­creas­ingly iso­lated govern­ment still saw the op­por­tu­nity to boost its in­ter­na­tional stand­ing and earn the sort of halo Soviet sci­ence did with the race to put hu­mans in space.</p>
    <p>The first vac­cine was, no sur­prise, named Sput­nik V. Yet with scarce data and plenty of govern­ment pro­mo­tion, the dash for ap­provals and show over re­sults has not trans­lated into im­pres­sive diplo­matic or do­mes­tic wins.</p>
    <p>For Rus­sia, man­u­fac­tur­ing hic­cups haven’t helped at home, nor have ac­cu­sa­tions from sev­eral coun­tries in July that Moscow-backed hack­ers tried to steal re­search. Ac­cord­ing to an Oc­to­ber sur­vey by the Le­vada Cen­tre, an in­de­pen­dent poll­ster, 59 per cent of Rus­sians would not</p>
    <p>take the vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>As Ms Ta­tiana Stanovaya, head of po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy R.Poli­tik put it to me, the Krem­lin, which saw the vac­cine as a ques­tion of pride and self-af­fir­ma­tion, sim­ply over­did the hype.</p>
    <p>The re­sult has been an acute lack of pub­lic trust. Bei­jing and Moscow got to the fin­ish line with im­pres­sive speed, but with­out the first-mover ad­van­tages they had hoped for.</p>
    <p>What­ever hap­pens next, they should con­sider the two spe­cific rea­sons for the predica­ment. The first is how the vac­cine has been treated in early stages of test­ing. Ev­ery­one has cut cor­ners, as break­throughs that usu­ally take years are hap­pen­ing over months. Too much is at stake. But there are ques­tions in par­tic­u­lar re­gard­ing ex­ten­sive ex­per­i­men­tal use in both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>China has in­jected thou­sands with un­proven shots out­side the trial process, many of them work­ers who may not have been at lib­erty to refuse. In Rus­sia, sci­en­tists in­oc­u­lated them­selves, and some of the coun­try’s wealth­i­est sub­mit­ted to the ex­per­i­men­tal serum too, as early as April. Test­ing co­horts have been small. Most im­por­tant, though, is the ques­tion of transparen­cy.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has pub­lished some in­for­ma­tion from its Phase 1 and 2 stud­ies for the Sput­nik vac­cine. Im­me­di­ately af­ter its first re­sults</p>
    <p>were pub­lished, though, con­cerns were raised by a group of West­ern sci­en­tists, query­ing, for ex­am­ple, re­peated pat­terns in the data that were not fully ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists from lead­ing Rus­sian uni­ver­si­ties have also asked for more in­for­ma­tion, fur­ther ques­tion­ing method­ol­ogy and data anal­y­sis. Even less is known about the sec­ond vac­cine can­di­date.</p>
    <p>So too in China. The United</p>
    <p>Arab Emi­rates has said the Sinopharm vac­cine showed</p>
    <p>86 per cent ef­fi­cacy in Phase 3 tests, but more de­tail is re­quired on side ef­fects and de­mo­graph­ics. It could still re­ceive China’s full ap­proval later this month.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia and China are al­ready reach­ing much of the de­vel­op­ing world with their eas­ier-to-store and most likely cheaper vac­cines. Bei­jing has joined Co­vax, the WHO-backed scheme to dis­trib­ute shots. Alibaba’s lo­gis­tics arm, for ex­am­ple, has al­ready es­tab­lished a cold chain route to Ad­dis Ababa.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian of­fi­cials say or­ders have been placed for 1.2 bil­lion doses. Hu­mankind needs as much suc­cess as it can muster. It just needs a lit­tle more data too.</p>
