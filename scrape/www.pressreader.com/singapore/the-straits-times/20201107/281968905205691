    <p>Paint­ing walls is a bit like surf­ing, ev­ery wave is dif­fer­ent, ev­ery wall is dif­fer­ent. That’s the big­gest chal­lenge for me. Scal­ing and the tech­ni­cal things are just part of the job now. MR FIN­TAN MAGEE, on the chal­lenges of his job.</p>
    <p>BARRABA • When Mr Fin­tan Magee was asked to paint a mu­ral on a trio of 40m-high grain silos in the small Aus­tralian t own of Barraba, he de­cided against an ar­che­typal im­age of sheep and cat­tle.</p>
    <p>In­stead he painted a wa­ter diviner, a per­son in­volved in a prac­tice still used in parts of Aus­tralia where pro­po­nents be­lieve they can find ground wa­ter with two metal rods or, as pic­tured in the mu­ral, sticks.</p>
    <p>Painted last year, it is one of dozens of large-scale mu­rals to ap­pear across ru­ral Aus­tralia, turn­ing sides of build­ings, wa­ter tanks and old grain silos into strik­ing can­vasses. “Paint­ing walls is a bit like surf­ing, ev­ery wave is dif­fer­ent, ev­ery wall is dif­fer­ent. That’s the big­gest chal­lenge for me,” Mr Magee told Reuters from his art stu­dio in Syd­ney’s in­ner-west­ern sub­urbs.</p>
    <p>“Scal­ing and the tech­ni­cal things are just part of the job now.”</p>
    <p>Many of the works were painted dur­ing a long drought that dev­as­tated com­mu­ni­ties and led to wide­spread wa­ter re­stric­tions, in­clud­ing in agri­cul­tural towns such as Barraba in cen­tral New South Wales.</p>
    <p>Mr Magee said that dur­ing a re­search trip, he saw a diviner work­ing with wa­ter bore drillers dur­ing the drought, which started to ease only early this year.</p>
    <p>While broadly con­sid­ered street art, the sheer size of the mu­rals makes them a phe­nom­e­non of their own. Many artists use cherry picker cranes or lifts to reach their can­vasses, go through hun­dreds of litres of paint and spend weeks on their mu­rals.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t re­ally un­til the last three or four years that projects have been grow­ing big­ger and big­ger – more stuff hap­pen­ing in Syd­ney and Mel­bourne and also the silo thing has ex­ploded,” said Mr Magee.</p>
    <p>The size has one great ad­van­tage over other forms of art – it is al­most im­pos­si­ble for passers-by not to take it in.</p>
    <p>“It’s ab­so­lutely gor­geous, it wasn’t here last time we came</p>
    <p>through,” said Ms Cathy Skin­ner, one of sev­eral peo­ple who stopped at the Barraba mu­ral when Reuters vis­ited last week.</p>
    <p>“I think he l ooks like Prince Harry, I think he’s won­der­ful,” Ms Skin­ner said of the wa­ter diviner.</p>
    <p>The re­sem­blance to the Bri­tish prince is often re­marked upon. Mr Magee said while he did not see the like­ness, other than the red hair, peo­ple were free to come to their own con­clu­sions.</p>
    <p>“I don’t see why Prince Harry would be di­vin­ing in cen­tral New South Wales, but who knows, he might have been through town on a royal trip one time,” he said.</p>
