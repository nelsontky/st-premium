    <p>WELLING­TON New Zealand’s new for­eign min­is­ter said yes­ter­day that her coun­try would be will­ing to help ne­go­ti­ate a truce be­tween neigh­bour­ing Aus­tralia and re­gional heavy­weight China, who are caught in an es­ca­lat­ing trade and diplo­matic spat.</p>
    <p>Ms Nanaia Mahuta, 50, said host­ing the high-pro­file Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) sum­mit next year pre­sented an op­por­tu­nity for New Zealand to bring both par­ties to the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>“Do I be­lieve that there might be an op­por­tu­nity for New Zealand to cre­ate a dif­fer­ent en­vi­ron­ment and have a con­ver­sa­tion? Yes, I do,” Ms Mahuta said in an in­ter­view with Reuters. “And I think host­ing Apec might well be the op­por­tu­nity... but both par­ties will have to be will­ing to come to­gether and con­cede in some ar­eas where they are cur­rently not see­ing eye to eye.”</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions have de­te­ri­o­rated over new for­eign in­ter­fer­ence and in­vest­ment laws in Aus­tralia, calls for an in­quiry into the ori­gins of the coron­avirus and Chi­nese blocks on Aus­tralian ex­ports.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions wors­ened last month af­ter a Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman posted a tweet that fea­tured a pho­to­shopped im­age of an Aus­tralian sol­dier hold­ing a blood­ied knife to the throat of an Afghan child. It was a ref­er­ence to an Aus­tralian war crimes in­quiry, which found that Aus­tralian troops had mur­dered Afghan civil­ians.</p>
    <p>New Zealand raised con­cerns with China about us­ing the im­age.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think Twit­ter diplo­macy can be achieved when dis­in­for­ma­tion is pro­moted through so­cial me­dia. I think we need to go back to tried and tested diplo­macy which is di­a­logue and en­sur­ing doors are open so peo­ple can work through some chal­leng­ing is­sues,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Mahuta also re­cently joined coun­ter­parts from Five Eyes in­tel­li­gence part­ners – Aus­tralia, Bri­tain, Canada and the United</p>
    <p>States – in con­demn­ing China for dis­qual­i­fy­ing leg­is­la­tors in Hong Kong. This an­gered China which re­acted by warn­ing the West­ern al­liance that it could get “poked in the eye”.</p>
    <p>Un­der Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern’s govern­ment, New Zealand has crit­i­cised China’s lend­ing to small Pa­cific is­lands, raised con­cerns about Mus­lim Uighurs in China’s Xin­jiang re­gion and backed Tai­wan’s par­tic­i­pa­tion at the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion de­spite a warn­ing from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Law pro­fes­sor Alexan­der Gille­spie from the Univer­sity of Waikato said New Zealand is still well placed to try to bro­ker some kind of calm­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“There is no guar­an­tee that get­ting the two sides to sit down and talk calmly will work. It would be a very, very, long road ahead – but it would be head­ing in a dif­fer­ent di­rec­tion to where we are cur­rently go­ing,” he said.</p>
