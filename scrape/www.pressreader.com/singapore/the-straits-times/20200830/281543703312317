    <p>Coro­n­avirus test­ing will be ex­panded in the com­ing weeks to in­clude groups such as taxi and pri­vate-hire car driv­ers and food de­liv­ery per­son­nel, as part of ef­forts to pro­vide a bet­ter pic­ture of in­fec­tion preva­lence in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day that test­ing will also be ex­tended to key ven­dors ser­vic­ing for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries, as well as stall­hold­ers at hawker cen­tres, mar­kets and cof­fee shops.</p>
    <p>These groups were cho­sen be­cause of the fre­quency of their in­ter­ac­tions with mem­bers of the pub­lic, even though there is no ev­i­dence so far that they have a higher risk of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The min­istry urged in­di­vid­u­als in these groups to come for­ward and take the one-time test, which will be fully paid for by the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>MOH reg­u­larly re­views its test­ing strate­gies to step up its sur­veil­lance of in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity. Test­ing was ex­panded to in­clude pre-school teach­ers, nurs­ing home staff and res­i­dents, and any­one above the age of 12 who are di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Among the first groups to be tested were health­care work­ers and front-line of­fi­cers who had in­ter­acted with Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>In its statement yes­ter­day, MOH re­it­er­ated that makeshift face cov­er­ings such as ban­danas, scarves and neck gaiters should not be used, as per the rec­om­men­da­tions of the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that there have been re­cent queries on the ef­fi­cacy of such makeshift cov­er­ings in pre­vent­ing dis­ease trans­mis­sion, the min­istry said that they may not per­form as well as pur­pose-built masks, as they may not have a good fit around the wearer’s nose and mouth and are made from ma­te­ri­als that are not spe­cific for dis­ease pre­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>“A mask should be worn such that it closely and com­pletely cov­ers the wearer’s nose and mouth, with­out leav­ing a gap be­tween the mask and the face,” the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Tighter reg­u­la­tions on what con­sti­tutes a mask and how it should be worn also came into ef­fect yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to a no­tice gazetted on Friday. The def­i­ni­tion of a mask has been re­vised to mean a cov­er­ing made of pa­per, plas­tic or tex­tile solely de­signed to be worn over the nose and mouth as pro­tec­tion against in­fec­tion or air pol­lu­tion, but ex­cludes a face shield.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, a mask was de­fined as “any pa­per or tex­tile cov­er­ing de­signed or made to be worn over the nose and mouth to pro­vide the wearer pro­tec­tion against in­fec­tions or air pol­lu­tion, but ex­cludes a face shield”. A mask is now also re­quired to touch the wearer’s nose, cheeks and chin when worn.</p>
    <p>The previous leg­is­la­tion stated only that it needed to touch the wearer’s nose and cheeks.</p>
    <p>Se­nior crim­i­nal lawyer Ra­jan Supra­ma­niam said that the amended reg­u­la­tions give more clar­ity over what con­sti­tutes a mask and are “more de­ci­sive”.</p>
    <p>Any­one caught wear­ing a face cov­er­ing that does not con­form to reg­u­la­tions may be rep­ri­manded, warned or even fined, he said.</p>
    <p>The law states that those who are caught not wear­ing a mask can be fined $300. The reg­u­la­tions un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act were amended af­ter a re­cent in­ci­dent when a bus driver re­fused to al­low a man wear­ing a neck gaiter to board.</p>
    <p>A study pub­lished by Duke Univer­sity in the United States ear­lier this month found that wear­ing a sin­gle-layer neck gaiter made of 92 per cent polyester and 8 per cent span­dex is worse than not wear­ing a mask at all, as the gaiter dis­perses large droplets into a mul­ti­tude of small droplets which then re­main in the air longer.</p>
