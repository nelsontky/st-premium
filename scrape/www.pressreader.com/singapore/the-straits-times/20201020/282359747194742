    <p>• The Qatari takeover of Paris Saint-Ger­main had oc­curred two years ear­lier, but it was the 2013 cap­ture of Edin­son Ca­vani from Napoli for a then French record €64 mil­lion (S$102.3 mil­lion) that sig­nalled the team’s in­ten­tion to com­pete for the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>The Uruguay striker, in his seven years with PSG, proved to be an un­qual­i­fied suc­cess, win­ning mul­ti­ple Ligue 1 ti­tles and do­mes­tic cups, and be­com­ing their record goalscorer with 200 strikes in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Although Ca­vani could not help the team lift their maiden Cham­pi­ons League – he was re­leased in June be­fore PSG reached their first fi­nal where they fell to Bay­ern Mu­nich – he re­mains a revered fig­ure at the Parc des Princes.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Manch­ester United took a gam­ble by land­ing the 33-year-old free agent on trans­fer dead­line day in the hope that the vet­eran can have the same gal­vanis­ing im­pact as pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­enced sign­ings like Zla­tan Ibrahi­movic, Hen­rik Lars­son and Lau­rent Blanc.</p>
    <p>Ca­vani was un­able to make his de­but for the Red Devils in their win over New­cas­tle in the Pre­mier League on Satur­day as he was still self-iso­lat­ing as per Bri­tish health reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he is ex­pected to make his first ap­pear­ance for United to­day in what will be an emo­tional re­union at a club where he en­joyed his great­est suc­cess as a player.</p>
    <p>There will no fans in the Group H Cham­pi­ons League opener due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic but PSG coach Thomas Tuchel will roll out a warm wel­come for “a player who wrote the club’s his­tory”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, at his vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the Ger­man in­sisted the game was not about “Ca­vani against PSG or PSG against Ca­vani but a match against Manch­ester United”.</p>
    <p>Warn­ing his in­jury-hit squad to stay fo­cused, Tuchel said: “It will be a bit strange to see him against us. We will have to be vig­i­lant be­cause it is al­ways dif­fi­cult to de­fend him and he has the abil­ity to make a dif­fer­ence. He is a player of ad­di­tional qual­ity in this Manch­ester team.”</p>
    <p>On their pre­vi­ous clash – in the last 16 of the 2018-19 campaign – Tuchel claimed it would have no bear­ing on to­day’s game as both teams had changed quite a bit.</p>
    <p>Dis­miss­ing claims that United’s de­fence re­mains vul­ner­a­ble – they have con­ceded 12 goals in four Pre­mier League games this sea­son – he said: “They’re one of the best teams in Europe in terms of at­tack and tran­si­tions. It’s key to stop them be­fore they start their counter-at­tacks.”</p>
    <p>Tuchel also said it was “sad” PSG could not come to an agree­ment with Ca­vani to ex­tend his con­tract until the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal in late Au­gust, ad­mit­ting he may have made a dif­fer­ence when they were search­ing for the equaliser against Bay­ern, who won 1-0.</p>
    <p>An­der Her­rera, who will also be en­joy­ing a sim­i­lar re­union in what will be his first meet­ing with United since leav­ing Manch­ester on a free trans­fer for PSG last sum­mer.</p>
    <p>There will be plenty of smiles and hugs for Ca­vani from his former team­mates but the niceties will end once the game kicks off.</p>
    <p>Her­rera added: “He is a friend and an ex­cep­tional player to whom I wish the best... but not this Tues­day.”</p>
    <p>The Spain mid­fielder is ex­pected to fea­ture as Tuchel re­vealed the French tre­ble win­ners will be miss­ing Marco Ver­ratti and Leandro Pare­des through in­jury.</p>
    <p>Striker Mauro Icardi is also out as are de­fen­sive duo Thilo Kehrer and Juan Ber­nat, but the club are cross­ing their fingers over Mar­quin­hos and Ju­lian Draxler, with both play­ers set for a late fit­ness test.</p>
    <p>While PSG are set to field their pre­ferred star front three of Ney­mar, Kylian Mbappe and An­gel di Maria, like United, they can also be sus­cep­ti­ble at the back.</p>
    <p>Given the op­po­si­tion’s in­jury prob­lems, United for­ward Mar­cus Rash­ford feels there may be no bet­ter time for Ca­vani to en­dear him­self to the Old Traf­ford faith­ful than get­ting his ac­count up and run­ning against his former club.</p>
    <p>“As a for­ward line it is some­thing to look for­ward to,” the Eng­land in­ter­na­tional told Sky Sports. “Hope­fully, he comes in and scores goals, be­cause he can def­i­nitely help us win games and points. He can be a mas­sive player for us this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“To win two or three tro­phies in a sea­son, you need a squad, it’s not pos­si­ble if you don’t have people who can score goals one week and the next week.”</p>
    <p>They’re one of the best teams in Europe in terms of at­tack and tran­si­tions. It’s key to stop them be­fore they start their counter-at­tacks.</p>
