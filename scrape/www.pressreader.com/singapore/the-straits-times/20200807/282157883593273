    <p>For­eign­ers bore the brunt of last month’s re­trench­ment ex­er­cise at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS), with the in­te­grated re­sort mak­ing ef­forts to cut costs and man­age­ment salaries be­fore it laid off work­ers, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the re­trench­ment, lo­cal work­ers formed about 66 per cent of the staff. Af­ter the lay­offs, the pro­por­tion in­creased to 75 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, af­ter the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise, RWS has a stronger Sin­ga­porean core,” said the min­istry, re­spond­ing to queries on the lay­ing off of about 2,000 RWS em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“In all in­stances where a for­eign em­ployee and lo­cal em­ployee had the same per­for­mance grade, pref­er­ence was given to the lo­cal to be re­tained. In fact, for each cat­e­gory of work­ers, the for­eign em­ployee had to have a higher per­for­mance rat­ing com­pared to the lo­cal em­ployee, in or­der not to be re</p>

    <p>It also said RWS gave added con­sid­er­a­tion to re­tain lo­cal em­ploy­ees who vol­un­teered to work at the com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity set up by RWS in April to help in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Some af­fected work­ers had voiced con­cerns and sought help from MOM and the At­trac­tions, Re­sorts and En­ter­tain­ment Union. They asked if RWS had con­sid­ered other op­tions be­sides re­trench­ment, ex­pressed con­cerns over the re­trench­ment ben­e­fits quan­tum, and wanted to know if RWS had re­tained for­eign­ers at the ex­pense of lo­cal em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>MOM said that prior to the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise, RWS worked closely with the union to en­sure that the ex­er­cise would be car­ried out fairly and re­spon­si­bly ac­cord­ing to the tri­par­tite ad­vi­sories.</p>
    <p>On the re­trench­ment ben­e­fits paid, MOM said RWS had ad­hered to min­istry guide­lines on such mat­ters, not­ing that the pay­ment of half a month’s salary per year of ser­vice for those re­trenched and el­i­gi­ble for the pay­out is within tri­par­tite guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Based on in­for­ma­tion pro­vided by RWS, MOM said the in­te­grated re­sort had made ef­forts to cut non-es­sen­tial spend­ing and re­duced man­age­ment salaries by up to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it will con­tinue to mon­i­tor un­fair prac­tices among com­pa­nies con­duct­ing re­trench­ments and re­minded em­ploy­ers to treat all work­ers with dig­nity and re­spect, as well as for man­age­ment to share the bur­den of cut­ting costs to save jobs.</p>
