    <p>Eight food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets were or­dered to close, and 26 other out­lets and 51 peo­ple were fined, for breaches of safe man­age­ment mea­sures dur­ing the yearend fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Among the out­lets or­dered to close are Meltz Resto-Bar at 24 Race Course Road and Club V5 Ty­coon in Ming Ar­cade at 21 Cus­ca­den Road, said the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Meltz was found to have com­mit­ted mul­ti­ple breaches of safe man­age­ment mea­sures at 9.25pm on New Year’s Eve. These breaches in­cluded al­low­ing a group of 10 to be seated to­gether at a ta­ble, and fail­ing to con­duct tem­per­a­ture screen­ing and im­ple­ment SafeEn­try for pa­trons.</p>
    <p>On the same day, Club V5 Ty­coon was found to have al­lowed pa­trons to con­sume al­co­hol at 11.15pm, past the cut-off time of 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>MSE said the club had been al­lowed to re­open as an F&B es­tab­lish­ment – with no live en­ter­tain­ment and singing ac­tiv­i­ties al­lowed – af­ter it ob­tained a food shop li­cence.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board has is­sued or­ders re­quir­ing both op­er­a­tors to close their premises for 10 days, start­ing from Jan 1.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, MSE gave de­tails on three F&B out­lets – Club Lux in Or­chard Plaza, Epi­phyte at 47 Neil Road, and TCC in In­ter­na­tional Build­ing at 360 Or­chard Road – that were fined $1,000 each.</p>
    <p>They had com­mit­ted of­fences such as seat­ing groups of pa­trons less than 1m apart, fail­ing to en­sure a 1m dis­tance be­tween cus­tomers in a queue, and pro­vid­ing games to pa­trons de­spite not be­ing an amuse­ment cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also said 15 of the peo­ple who were fined had gath­ered and sat in groups larger than the per­mit­ted group size at F&B out­lets in phases two and three – five and eight re­spec­tively. They were fined $300 each.</p>
    <p>MSE said that while Sin­ga­pore has pro­gressed to phase three of its re­open­ing, there is still lo­cal trans­mis</p>
    <p>sion of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Busi­nesses and mem­bers of the pub­lic must con­tinue to ad­here to safe man­age­ment mea­sures to keep com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion low.</p>
    <p>“We urge ev­ery­one to re­main so­cially re­spon­si­ble by keep­ing group sizes small and wear­ing a mask at all times at F&B premises, un­less drink­ing or eat­ing. This will</p>
    <p>help to safe­guard pub­lic health, while al­low­ing busi­nesses to re­main open,” MSE said.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment will not hes­i­tate to take strong en­force­ment ac­tion against er­rant op­er­a­tors and in­di­vid­u­als who breach safe man­age­ment mea­sures.”</p>
