    <p>Busi­nesses in the heart­land are likely to see con­tin­ued in­creases in rev­enue, as con­sumer spend­ing has shifted from the city to the sub­urbs.</p>
    <p>So long as work-from-home ar­range­ments and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures per­sist, this trend will likely con­tinue, said re­searchers at the Asia Com­pet­i­tive­ness In­sti­tute (ACI), a lo­cal think-tank in the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“What we are see­ing is a re­dis­tri­bu­tion of the busi­ness land­scape. In com­par­i­son to pre-pan­demic fig­ures, we saw an 8 per cent in­crease in spend­ing in the sub­urbs by phase two,” said Dr Xie Taojun, se­nior re­search fel­low at the ACI, adding that this rise was sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>Dr Xie was speak­ing at an on­line panel dis­cus­sion, or­gan­ised by the in­sti­tute yes­ter­day, on how con­sumer pat­terns have shifted dur­ing the pan­demic. His re­search on con­sumer trends dur­ing the pan­demic was con­ducted based on anonymised data pro­vided to the ACI by Master­card.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers tracked spend­ing pat­terns from April 7 to June 30 – which cov­ered the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and two weeks of phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>They found that over­all spend­ing in the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict and the city took a hit, while heart­land districts, par­tic­u­larly in western Sin­ga­pore, recorded a boost in re­tail. Ar­eas in east­ern Sin­ga­pore, fo­cused around in­dus­trial ar­eas like Changi Busi­ness Park, also saw a drop in con­sumer spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“These find­ings were as ex­pected, as spend­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker shifted to more densely pop­u­lated res­i­den­tial ar­eas. Cus­tomers be­gan to pa­tro­n­ise stores around them more of­ten too, when they be­gan to work from home,” Dr Xie said.</p>
    <p>He added that this re­dis­tri­bu­tion of spend­ing will be­come a last­ing norm if of­fice space in the cen­tral re­gion re­mains less utilised. In ad­di­tion, it will take tourists re­turn­ing to re­tail spa­ces – per­haps as a re­sult of air travel bub­bles – to bring up spend­ing levels in the city.</p>
    <p>The study also in­di­cated that con­sumers have be­come very ac­cus­tomed to on­line spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Xie told The Straits Times that there was a shift to­wards on­line spend­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, but no sig­nif­i­cant drop in</p>
    <p>These find­ings were as ex­pected, as spend­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker shifted to more densely pop­u­lated res­i­den­tial ar­eas. Cus­tomers be­gan to pa­tro­n­ise stores around them more of­ten too, when they be­gan to work from home.</p>
    <p>the level of spend­ing even as stores opened. This showed that even when given the op­por­tu­nity to shop in per­son at bricks-and-mor­tar re­tail­ers, peo­ple still chose to go on­line.</p>
    <p>“Whether this is the new nor­mal is yet to be seen, but it is clear that peo­ple have be­come used to on­line pay­ments, and this will per­sist for some time,” Dr Xie said.</p>
    <p>“Busi­nesses could re­cal­i­brate parts of their busi­ness mod­els to ac­com­mo­date on­line or cash­less pay­ments, and pay at­ten­tion to con­sumer be­hav­iour and spend­ing trends,” he added.</p>
    <p>Pan­el­lists at the ACI’s we­bi­nar yes­ter­day also noted that economies that were han­dling the pan­demic well were see­ing a marked re­bound in re­tail spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ling Hai, co-pres­i­dent for Asia-Pa­cific at Master­card, cit­ing num­bers from CEIC Data, a global data­base of mar­ket data, said: “Based on the Septem­ber re­tail sales growth num­bers, what’s clear for Asia is that (economies) that have done a good job con­trol­ling the pan­demic have seen a strong do­mes­tic re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>He cited the ex­am­ples of Tai­wan, which saw 5.8 per cent re­tail sales</p>
    <p>growth, and South Korea, which at­tained 3.2 per cent growth in re­tail sales in Septem­ber – num­bers com­pa­ra­ble to pre-pan­demic levels.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sin­ga­pore – which last year clocked an av­er­age of neg­a­tive 8.4 per cent in do­mes­tic re­tail sales growth – saw these num­bers worsen to neg­a­tive 12.9 per cent in Septem­ber this year.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenges that re­main hinge mainly on cross-bor­der travel, as economies re­main vul­ner­a­ble and ex­posed to in­ter­na­tional trade and tourism,” Mr Ling said.</p>
    <p>DR XIE TAOJUN, se­nior re­search fel­low at the Asia Com­pet­i­tive­ness In­sti­tute, on how con­sumer pat­terns have shifted dur­ing the pan­demic. He added that this re­dis­tri­bu­tion of spend­ing will be­come a last­ing norm if of­fice space in the cen­tral re­gion re­mains less utilised.</p>
