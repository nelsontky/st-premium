    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s core and head­line in­fla­tion both weak­ened last month, con­tin­u­ing a de­fla­tion­ary trend seen in pre­vi­ous months.</p>
    <p>In­fla­tion­ary pres­sures are likely to re­main muted for the rest of the year, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Core in­fla­tion, which ex­cludes ac­com­mo­da­tion and pri­vate road trans­port costs, came in at -0.2 per cent year on year last month, slightly be­low the -0.1 per cent seen in Septem­ber, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) and the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This was due to steeper de­clines in the costs of ser­vices, re­tail and other goods as well as food.</p>
    <p>Core in­fla­tion has de­clined on a year-on-year ba­sis for nine straight months.</p>
    <p>Over­all in­fla­tion dipped to -0.2 per cent year on year last month, down from zero in the pre­vi­ous month, on the back of a sharper drop in pri­vate trans­port costs, lower ac­com­mo­da­tion in­fla­tion and the fall in core con­sumer prices.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank economist Barn­abas Gan noted that while lower con­sumer prices could still be seen for the rest of the year, in­fla­tion from food, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and ve­hi­cles could help to cush­ion the de­fla­tion­ary ef­fects from other clus­ters.</p>
    <p>“None­the­less, low oil prices are likely here to stay amid an ab­sent tourism-driven de­mand at least for the rest of 2020,” he said, not­ing that cheaper oil will help to cap the cost of trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng econ­o­mists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye said core in­fla­tion will likely stay muted as ser­vices and re­tail in­fla­tion will be cur­tailed by con­tin­ued safe dis­tanc­ing and work-from-home mea­sures, a weak labour mar­ket and cau­tious con­sumer sen­ti­ments.</p>
    <p>“Ex­ter­nal in­fla­tion is ex­pected to stay soft on the back of weak de­mand con­di­tions in key com­mod­ity mar­kets,” they said.</p>
    <p>Ser­vices costs de­creased more quickly at 0.5 per cent year on year last month, com­pared with a 0.1 per cent de­cline in Septem­ber, due to lower telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion ser­vices in­fla­tion and a larger drop in tuition and other fees.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate trans­port costs also fell more steeply, at 1.3 per cent com­pared with 0.1 per cent in the pre­vi­ous month, as car prices rose at a more grad­ual pace amid a sharper de­cline in fuel ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Food prices climbed at a slower rate of 1.7 per cent last month, down slightly from 1.8 per cent in Septem­ber, as the cost of non­cooked food rose at a more</p>
    <p>Over­all in­fla­tion dipped to -0.2 per cent year on year last month, down from zero in the pre­vi­ous month, on the back of a sharper drop in pri­vate trans­port costs, lower ac­com­mo­da­tion in­fla­tion, and the fall in core con­sumer prices.</p>
    <p>mod­er­ate pace.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric­ity and gas costs fell 7.2 per cent last month, com­pared with a 14.2 per cent de­cline in the pre­vi­ous month, due to up­ward re­vi­sions in elec­tric­ity and gas tar­iffs.</p>
    <p>MAS and MTI said ex­ter­nal in­fla­tion is likely to re­main low in the quar­ters ahead amid weak de­mand con­di­tions in key com­mod­ity mar­kets and a per­sis­tence of spare pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity in Sin­ga­pore’s ma­jor trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>Cost pres­sures are also ex­pected to stay sub­dued lo­cally, with the ac­cu­mu­lated slack in the labour mar­ket damp­en­ing wages.</p>
    <p>How­ever, core in­fla­tion is fore­cast to turn “mildly pos­i­tive” next year, with de­mand for some do­mes­tic ser­vices grad­u­ally pick­ing up and the dis­in­fla­tion­ary ef­fects of gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies in­tro­duced this year fad­ing.</p>
    <p>In the re­port, MAS and MTI re­it­er­ated their core and over­all in­fla­tion fore­cast of be­tween -0.5 and 0 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Core in­fla­tion is pre­dicted to av­er­age 0 to 1 per cent next year, while over­all con­sumer in­fla­tion is pro­jected to come in at be­tween -0.5 and 0.5 per cent.</p>
