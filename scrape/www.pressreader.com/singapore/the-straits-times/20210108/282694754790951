    <p>Joe Gardner, voiced by Jamie Foxx, is a mu­sic teacher who yearns to play pro­fes­sion­ally with a jazz out­fit.</p>
    <p>His life is cut short as he is on the verge of achiev­ing his goal.</p>
    <p>Un­will­ing to go to his eter­nal rest, he fi­na­gles his way to another di­men­sion, the Great Be­fore, where freshly minted souls are pre­pared for life on Earth. He meets 22, voiced by Tina Fey, an Earth-avoidant trou­ble­maker who has sab­o­taged ev­ery at­tempt at be­ing born into a hu­man body.</p>
    <p>You will not be sur­prised to learn that di­rec­tor and co-writer Pete Doc­ter worked on Inside Out (2015), another an­i­mated film that, like Soul, turns ab­stract con­cepts into char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Here, as in the pre­vi­ous film, the adora­bil­ity fac­tor is high, helped along by tal­ents such as Bri­tish ac­tor</p>
    <p>Richard Ayoade, who plays a be­fore-life coun­sel­lor with the cheer­i­ness of a chil­dren’s tele­vi­sion show host. Coun­sel­lors like him in­habit a weird yet fully formed spir­i­tual di­men­sion.</p>
    <p>Cre­at­ing a uni­verse from scratch has al­ways been a Pixar strength. With the help of co-writer and co-di­rec­tor Kemp Pow­ers, the earthly world of New York’s black neigh­bour­hoods also comes to vi­brant life, giv­ing this story of what it means to find joy the firm ground it needs.</p>
