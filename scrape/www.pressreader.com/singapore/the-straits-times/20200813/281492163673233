    <p>Take in the sights and sounds of the Is­tana from a bird’s eye view, be­fore swoop­ing in up close for in­ti­mate de­tails of its main build­ing and lit­tle­known spots – all with­out step­ping into the na­tional mon­u­ment.</p>
    <p>A mul­ti­me­dia project on one of Sin­ga­pore’s most well-known land­marks has won The Straits Times a key award at a pres­ti­gious in­ter­na­tional con­test for in­fo­graph­ics.</p>
    <p>ST clinched a sil­ver medal for In­side The Is­tana and three bronze medals this year in its best show­ing at the Malofiej 28th In­ter­na­tional In­fo­graph­ics Awards, known as the Pulitzers for in­fo­graph­ics.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by the So­ci­ety for</p>
    <p>News De­sign – Spain, this year’s edi­tion saw 1,000 en­tries from 162 me­dia out­lets across 34 coun­tries. A to­tal of 170 medals for both print and dig­i­tal me­dia were awarded last week at the Malofiej In­fo­graph­ics World Sum­mit in Pam­plona, Spain.</p>
    <p>The ST project was launched last year in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Is­tana to mark its 150th an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>It takes read­ers through a vir­tual tour of the of­fi­cial res­i­dence of Sin­ga­pore’s pres­i­dent with im­mer­sive sto­ry­telling fea­tures, such as aug­mented re­al­ity and 360-de­gree video. Key high­lights in­clude never-be­fore-seen aerial views of the sprawl­ing Is­tana grounds, and un­prece­dented ac­cess to lesser­known spots, such as an air raid shel­ter dat­ing back to World War II.</p>
    <p>POWER OF IM­MER­SIVE STO­RY­TELLING</p>
    <p>This in­sider tour of the Is­tana shows the value and po­ten­tial of im­mer­sive sto­ry­telling, espe­cially at a time when phys­i­cal events and vis­its have gone on­line be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic. We were grate­ful to be given great ac­cess to</p>
    <p>’’ the Is­tana for this col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>ST DIG­I­TAL ED­I­TOR ONG HWEE HWEE</p>
    <p>The project was in­cor­po­rated into the Is­tana’s first vir­tual Na­tional Day Open House on Aug 2. The event was hosted on Pres­i­dent Halimah Yacob’s Face­book and In­sta­gram plat­forms ow­ing to</p>
    <p>Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Said ST dig­i­tal ed­i­tor Ong Hwee Hwee: “This in­sider tour of the Is­tana shows the value and po­ten­tial of im­mer­sive sto­ry­telling, espe­cially at a time when phys­i­cal events have gone on­line be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic. We were grate­ful to be given ac­cess to the Is­tana for this spe­cial col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“We are de­lighted that sev­eral of our in­ter­ac­tive projects, which use in­no­va­tive ways to present in­for­ma­tion, are among the very best recog­nised at this pres­ti­gious event.”</p>
    <p>It took the ST team about three months to com­plete the project.</p>
    <p>ST in­ter­ac­tive graph­ics ed­i­tor Rodolfo Pa­zos said that its suc­cess would not have been pos­si­ble with­out the di­verse skills of ST’s dig­i­tal graph­ics, photo and video teams, and the col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ tech team.</p>
    <p>He said: “To re­ceive four medals, and with one of them a sil­ver, is an achieve­ment that will mo­ti­vate us to de­liver even bet­ter works.”</p>
    <p>The other three projects which won bronze medals were on the Hong Kong-Bei­jing high-speed rail, Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­est­ing street names, and e-com­merce pack­ag­ing waste.</p>
    <p>Se­nior ex­ec­u­tive con­tent pro­ducer Denise Chong, who worked on the Is­tana and pack­ag­ing waste projects, said: “At the heart of both graph­ics is the goal of giv­ing read­ers a fun ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>This year, The New York Times won the top award in the print cat­e­gory for What Path Takes You to Congress. Na­tional Ge­o­graphic’s At­las of Moons topped the dig­i­tal cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Other win­ners at the awards in­clude Reuters, South China Morn­ing Post, The Wash­ing­ton Post and La Na­cion.</p>
