    <p>The na­tional con­ver­sa­tion on prickly top­ics such as race and re­li­gion needs to move away from the confrontat­ional and fo­cus on the com­mon space, said Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong.</p>
    <p>To that end, the Gov­ern­ment will cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans to ex­press their views with­out get­ting “shouted down”.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have dif­fer­ent views – some­times strongly so – and that can be­come abra­sive,” he told The Straits Times in an in­ter­view yes­ter­day. “So what we need to do is fa­cil­i­tate plat­forms so that th­ese con­ver­sa­tions can be con­ducted in a safe space.</p>
    <p>“A lot of (the ap­proach to dis­cussing sen­si­tive is­sues) is im­ported from the Western world where there is can­cel cul­ture, or you may call it some other thing, but the ap­proach to try­ing to deal with dif­fer­ences is to con­front. And I think we must find a way to have less of that.”</p>
    <p>In­stead, Sin­ga­pore has to adopt a more “me­di­a­tory ap­proach” to re­solv­ing dif­fer­ences, he said.</p>
    <p>“In­clu­siv­ity is not just about hav­ing dif­fer­ent peo­ple in the same place, it is re­ally (about) re­spect­ing and ac­cept­ing that there will be dif­fer­ences from your own view and learn­ing to live with it.”</p>
    <p>In his min­istry’s Ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, Mr Tong had said more op­por­tu­ni­ties will be cre­ated for Sin­ga­pore­ans to en­gage in “re­spect­ful di­a­logue” on sen­si­tive is­sues of race and re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>Th­ese new plat­forms to dis­cuss sen­si­tive is­sues will be “more cu­rated and tar­geted” than the Our Sin­ga­pore Con­ver­sa­tion se­ries, which took a broad-based ap­proach, he told ST.</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sions will also seek to ed­u­cate par­tic­i­pants, he added. “I don’t pre­sume that every­one who comes to such a di­a­logue fully un­der­stands, and I think knowl­edge and ed­u­ca­tion are a pre­cur­sor to a ro­bust dis­cus­sion.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the in­ter­view, he spoke on top­ics such as fos­ter­ing na­tional unity amid the Covid-19 pan­demic and laid out his immediate pri­or­i­ties as his min­istry’s new head.</p>
    <p>Al­though Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to forge a co­he­sive so­ci­ety over the years, the pan­demic may have caused peo­ple’s mind­sets to shift from co­he­sion to­wards self­p­reser­va­tion, he noted.</p>
    <p>“I think that’s un­der­stand­able in the cur­rent cli­mate, but if it pro­gresses in the long term, that’s go­ing to cause a prob­lem,” he said. “So we have to think in terms of how we can bring peo­ple to­gether.”</p>
    <p>His min­istry is uniquely placed to fa­cil­i­tate this en­deav­our, given that it is at the cross­roads of var­i­ous groups in so­ci­ety, he said.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was also asked how the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party plans to ad­dress the crit­i­cism from some quar­ters that it is re­sis­tant to new ideas. In this year’s gen­eral election, the rul­ing party won 83 out of 93 seats with a lower-than-ex­pected vote share of 61.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>“It starts by ac­knowl­edg­ing that there’s a lot more we can do bet­ter,” Mr Tong replied. “There’s a lot that has not gone right in the way we should en­gage, and I think the re­cent gen­eral election tells us that.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Hal­imah Ya­cob had said in her ad­dress to Par­lia­ment ear­lier this week that some prob­lems will re­quire fresh ap­proaches.</p>
    <p>“Therein lies the foun­da­tion of what we need to do, which is to not pre­sume that we know all the prob­lems. Even be­fore we can sell the an­swers, I think we have to de­fine the prob­lems,” he said.</p>
    <p>This means the na­tional con­ver­sa­tion will have to give peo­ple the chance to re­frame ex­ist­ing prob­lems, rather than just de­cid­ing on so­lu­tions, Mr Tong added.</p>
    <p>“I think with that base, we can start mov­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>He also out­lined three ar­eas he hopes to fo­cus on at his min­istry.</p>
    <p>He plans to sup­port the as­pi­ra­tions and ideals of young peo­ple, de­spite the chal­lenges posed by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He also wants to bring art ap­pre­ci­a­tion to the heart­land and take Sin­ga­pore for­ward on its path to be­come a first-class arts cen­tre.</p>
    <p>And he hopes to use sports as a ral­ly­ing point to build up the Sin­ga­pore spirit.</p>
    <p>“I think now more than ever, we need some­one to in­spire us... to show us what it means to work hard, to have grit, re­silience and de­ter­mi­na­tion. And I think sports­peo­ple and sports events have that ca­pac­ity.”</p>
