    <p>When she un­der­went ton­sil­li­tis surgery as a child and her first cae­sarean sec­tion in 1993, Madam Mon­ica Ramirez had the jit­ters.</p>
    <p>Both times, she did not fully know what to ex­pect dur­ing the op­er­a­tion, she said. She was stressed and did not take note of ev­ery­thing as the doc­tor was ex­plain­ing the pro­ce­dures to her.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when the 51-year-old house­wife, who has three chil­dren aged 13 to 27, went for surgery in May to re­move a tu­mour in her breast, she had a “dif­fer­ent and more com­fort­ing ex­pe­ri­ence”. It was the first time she bet­ter un­der­stood what lay ahead and felt “most at ease” be­fore an op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>About a week be­fore, her sur­geon Feli­cia Tan at FeM Surgery ex­plained the pro­ce­dure, risks and pos­si­ble com­pli­ca­tions to her.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan then let Madam Ramirez wear a head­set to view a vir­tual re­al­ity (VR) pre­sen­ta­tion of the op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>VR is the use of com­puter tech­nol­ogy to cre­ate a sim­u­lated en­vi­ron­ment, plac­ing the user in­side an ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the head­set, Madam Ramirez was able to ex­pe­ri­ence be­ing in the op­er­at­ing theatre and watch the surgery as a third-party observer.</p>
    <p>FeM Surgery has re­cently started us­ing such VR videos to com­ple­ment the doc­tor’s ex­pla­na­tion, har­ness­ing an im­mer­sive, 3D for­mat to fur­ther ex­plain po­ten­tial ad­verse out­comes.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the type of surgery, videos range from five to 10 min­utes long. Each ends with in­struc­tions for post-op­er­a­tive care at home.</p>
    <p>A check by The Straits Times with pub­lic hos­pi­tals found that they do not of­fer sim­i­lar VR ex­pe­ri­ences to pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Madam Ramirez, who has stage 3 breast can­cer, said that watch­ing the video helped her to un­der­stand what to ex­pect dur­ing and af­ter the surgery “in a more re­al­is­tic way”.</p>
    <p>“It can be in­for­ma­tion over­load when a doc­tor ex­plains what will hap­pen dur­ing surgery. The pa­tient could still be deal­ing with the news of the di­ag­no­sis, so the mind may not fully ab­sorb the in­for­ma­tion, or it could be dif­fi­cult to imag­ine the pro­ce­dure be­cause you are stressed,” she said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter watch­ing the video, she felt more con­fi­dent go­ing for the op­er­a­tion and had less fear and anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>Madam Ramirez was one of 25 pa­tients who took part in FeM Surgery’s pi­lot study on a “VR con­sent ser­vice” from May to June, be­fore it was rolled out to all its six surgery cen­tres in June. So far, 50 pa­tients have tried the ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, di­rec­tor of the group, said: “Dur­ing the pi­lot study, we made it com­pul­sory for pa­tients to use the ser­vice so we could gain ad­e­quate feed­back from pa­tients from all walks of life. This en­abled us to as­sess the ef­fi­cacy of this ser­vice and de­cide if it should be im­ple­mented.”</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally, a sur­geon would ex­plain to a pa­tient the pro­ce­dure and what to ex­pect dur­ing and af­ter the surgery us­ing pho­to­graphs, videos and 3D anatomy mod­els.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, it can still be dif­fi­cult for pa­tients to imag­ine it and this may cause some fear and anx­i­ety, said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>“Some pa­tients end up not go­ing for surgery be­cause in­suf­fi­cient in­for­ma­tion was given by the sur­geon or they do not fully un­der­stand the pro­ce­dure. As a re­sult, they feel anx­ious and fear­ful.”</p>
    <p>This VR con­sent ser­vice goes hand-in-hand with the sur­geon’s ex­pla­na­tion of the in­di­ca­tions and risks of the pro­ce­dure, said Dr Tan. “It does away with lengthy con­sul­ta­tions and low­ers the anx­i­ety level a pa­tient feels if he or she is shown graphic pho­to­graphs or videos dur­ing the con­sul­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ac­coun­tant Hannah Seow, 42, who went for surgery last month to re­move a tu­mour in her breast, was “very im­pressed” with the VR ex­pe­ri­ence. “We ab­sorb in­for­ma­tion more eas­ily when we are shown mov­ing vi­su­als rather than be­ing told about the pro­ce­dure. It def­i­nitely helped me to un­der­stand it bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, she said she was still afraid of com­pli­ca­tions that could arise dur­ing the surgery and if it would be a suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said 90 per cent of pa­tients felt the VR ex­pe­ri­ence was good and made them less anx­ious, while 10 per cent said it did not make a dif­fer­ence to them or their anx­i­ety lev­els.</p>
    <p>The VR con­sent ser­vice was cocre­ated by Sil­ver Wings In­ter­ac­tive So­lu­tions, an aug­mented, vir­tual and mixed-re­al­ity tech­nol­ogy firm. It is cur­rently of­fered at no ex­tra cost to pa­tients who un­dergo the five most com­mon sur­gi­cal pro­ce­dures per­formed at FeM Surgery clin­ics: cys­toscopy, colonoscop­y, vac­u­umas­sisted breast biopsy, breast wide ex­ci­sion and sentinel lymph node biopsy, and slipped disc surgery.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan was mo­ti­vated to pro­vide such a ser­vice due to the rise in the num­ber of medico-le­gal and com­plaint cases by pa­tients against sur­geons as a re­sult of an in­ad­e­quate con­sent-tak­ing process be­fore surgery.</p>
    <p>There were five such cases lodged against doc­tors in 2017 and 2018, com­pared with zero cases in 2016, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>“The un­der­ly­ing is­sue in these cases was claims by pa­tients that they were not in­formed of the pos­si­ble com­pli­ca­tions of a pro­ce­dure and wanted to take le­gal ac­tions against the doc­tor,” said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>FeM Surgery plans to roll out its VR ser­vice for the three most com­monly per­formed surg­eries in each sur­gi­cal sub-spe­cial­ity in its clin­ics by next Au­gust. It is also look­ing to make the tech­nol­ogy avail­able to pub­lic and pri­vate hos­pi­tals in Sin­ga­pore and across the world.</p>
    <p>Dr Fong Yang, an ob­ste­tri­cian and gy­nae­col­o­gist at As­tra Cen­tre for Women and Fer­til­ity, who was in­vited by FeM to try out the VR ser­vice at its clinic, said VR is a use­ful ed­u­ca­tional tool.</p>
    <p>It helps pa­tients un­der­stand the finer de­tails of the anatomy and the more sub­tle nu­ances clin­i­cians face when treat­ing a par­tic­u­lar con­di­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>“Ex­plain­ing in words, even with the aid of di­a­grams, may still not con­vey the im­por­tant sub­tleties faced in surgery. VR can high­light the po­ten­tial dif­fi­cul­ties faced by in­cor­po­rat­ing struc­tures like blood ves­sels, blad­der and in­testines in a more re­al­is­tic anatom­i­cal ori­en­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“This would al­low bet­ter vi­su­al­i­sa­tion and un­der­stand­ing. The pa­tient can do re­peated view­ings be­fore mak­ing a de­ci­sion on surgery. It will greatly help the process of in­formed con­sent-tak­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>We ab­sorb in­for­ma­tion more eas­ily when we are shown mov­ing vi­su­als rather than be­ing told about the pro­ce­dure. It def­i­nitely helped me to un­der­stand it bet­ter.</p>
