    <p>FIC­TION</p>
    <p>THE NEW WILDER­NESS</p>
    <p>By Diane Cook Oneworld/Pa­per­back/</p>
    <p>398 pages/$27.82/Avail­able at bit.ly/NewWild_Cook/</p>
    <p>In her de­but novel The New Wilder­ness, Amer­i­can au­thor Diane Cook imag­ines a world so rav­aged by cli­mate change, with over­pop­u­lated cities smoth­ered in smog and over­run by pests, that mankind is forced to ex­plore liv­ing in the wild.</p>
    <p>The Booker Prize-short­listed novel cen­tres on a band of vol­un­teers, the Com­mu­nity, who opt to join an ex­per­i­ment – the pur­pose of which is never fully ex­plained – to live a no­madic life in the Wilder­ness State, a vast, in­hos­pitable zone of pris­tine land­scape.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ur­ban refugees, left to fend for them­selves, quickly be­come numb to the idea of death in their un­pre­dictable en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The New Wilder­ness is Cook’s fol­low-up to Man V. Na­ture (2014), a crit­i­cally ac­claimed com­pen­dium of cli­mate-re­lated short sto­ries that was short­listed for the Guardian First Book Award.</p>
    <p>It is a timely novel given the threat of global warm­ing that the world is fac­ing to­day, though it is weak­ened by how the plot seems to me­an­der with lit­tle but petty hu­man drama hap­pen­ing for pages on end.</p>
    <p>This, how­ever, could be a re­flec­tion of what life is like with­out mod­ern-day com­forts.</p>
    <p>The novel fo­cuses pri­mar­ily on the mother-daugh­ter dy­namic be­tween Bea and Agnes. Bea joins the ex­per­i­ment in or­der to save Agnes, a young girl sick­ened by the pol­lu­tion of her old world.</p>
    <p>Agnes grows up in the course of the novel, turn­ing it into a comin­gof-age tale of a teenager re­belling against her mother – a fa­mil­iar plot­line in any genre – as she ar­gues for a more piv­otal role in the Com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Bea is not much more like­able and can come across as op­por­tunis­tic, al­though such traits are ne­ces­si­tated when the char­ac­ters are pushed to the brink in a world where man – even more so than wild an­i­mals or the rough el­e­ments – is the great­est threat.</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nity lives by the rules spelt out in a Man­ual en­forced by the whims of Rangers, who iron­i­cally ride around on large pol­lu­tive trucks de­spite the world they live in.</p>
    <p>There are clear al­pha lead­ers within the Com­mu­nity – in­clud­ing a bunch of New­com­ers who join the group mid­way through the novel – and sub-groups form in ways rem­i­nis­cent of re­al­ity se­ries Sur­vivor (2000 to present).</p>
    <p>Feral sur­vival in­stincts quickly come to the fore in this dystopian novel of a world where all hope is elu­sive, a cau­tion­ary tale of what might hap­pen if the world is re­duced to ruin.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Para­ble Of The Sower by Oc­tavia But­ler (Head­line Pub­lish­ing, 1993, reis­sued 2019, $18.95, avail­able at bit.ly/ParaSow­er_OB), a chill­ingly pre­scient novel set in Los An­ge­les in 2024.</p>
    <p>It imag­ines a world in chaos due to cli­mate change, wealth dis­par­ity, po­lice bru­tal­ity, cor­po­rate greed, and a mer­cu­rial, pro­tec­tion­ist pres­i­dent.</p>
