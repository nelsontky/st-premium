    <p>The Los An­ge­les Dodgers (right) shrugged off 32 years of pain and near misses to win base­ball’s World Se­ries for the sev­enth time, beat­ing the Tampa Bay Rays 3-1 in Game 6 on Tues­day in Texas. There was drama mid-game, as LA’s third base­man Justin Turner was taken off af­ter get­ting a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test re­sult.</p>
    <p>ARLINGTON (Texas) • As far as cham­pi­onship droughts go, this was not the long­est in Ma­jor League Base­ball’s (MLB) history or even the most ag­o­nis­ing.</p>
    <p>But in terms of re­cent ef­fort, in­clud­ing nearly US$2 bil­lion (S$2.73 bil­lion) spent on player salaries in the past eight years, and the frus­tra­tion of be­ing tan­talis­ingly close to that cel­e­bra­tory sip of cham­pagne with­out ac­tu­ally tast­ing it, the Los An­ge­les Dodgers’ dry spell had be­come the most prom­i­nent – and baf­fling – in the sport.</p>
    <p>They won seven straight di­vi­sional ti­tles with­out win­ning the World Se­ries. They made it to the 2017 World Se­ries, only to lose at home to a Hous­ton Astros team who would later be ex­posed as cheats.</p>
    <p>The next year, they lost at home again, to a Bos­ton Red Sox side led by Mookie Betts, now roam­ing the out­field for Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>But on their eighth con­sec­u­tive trip to the post­sea­son, the Dodgers fi­nally be­came cham­pi­ons, again.</p>
    <p>They beat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-1 in Game 6 of the World Se­ries on Tues­day at Globe Life Field as Betts hit a dou­ble and a home run, and scored twice to help the sto­ried fran­chise end 32 years of dis­ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>It was the sev­enth ti­tle for the Dodgers, their sixth since mov­ing to Los An­ge­les from Brook­lyn, New York, in 1957, and the first for Dave</p>
    <p>Roberts as a man­ager.</p>
    <p>The steady Roberts be­came only the third skip­per to win a World Se­ries with the Dodgers, join­ing Hall of Famers Wal­ter Al­ston and Tommy La­sorda.</p>
    <p>When Game 6 ended and all the pres­sure that had built up on this core group of play­ers was fi­nally re­leased, they ex­ploded out of the dugout and onto the field to cel­e­brate, know­ing that they would no longer be la­belled as un­der­achiev­ers and chok­ers.</p>
    <p>“To know what it feels like to lose,” said Corey Sea­ger, who was named the World Se­ries’ Most Valu­able Player. “To be able to re­build and come back and re­build and stay fo­cused, it’s spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>The vic­tory should help make up for the per­ceived in­jus­tice of 2017, when the Dodgers lost Game 7 to the Astros, a team who il­lic­itly stole signs that year and ad­mit­ted to the scheme af­ter an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by MLB last year.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle also should soothe the pain in­flicted in 2018 and last year, when they were bounced out of the play-offs – once again at home – in the first round by even­tual cham­pi­ons, the Wash­ing­ton Na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>This time was dif­fer­ent: a post­sea­son of un­usual cir­cum­stances, the team se­questered for weeks in a play-off bub­ble in Texas, the play­ers sep­a­rated from their ex­tended fam­i­lies and friends be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the con­ta­gion even over­shad­owed the cel­e­bra­tions, as it emerged that Dodgers third base­man Justin Turner had been re­moved from the game be­fore the top of the eighth be­cause he had re­ceived a pos­i­tive test re­sult for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>He was un­able to cel­e­brate with his team­mates but then re­turned to the field for a group photo, pulling off his mask, af­ter they clinched the cham­pi­onship. ESPN later re­ported that the team would take rapid Covid-19 tests af­ter they re­turned to their ho­tel rooms.</p>
    <p>But through all their post­sea­son games, the Dodgers made Globe Life Field their own.</p>
    <p>They played 16 post­sea­son games there and hit more home runs (29) in the new sta­dium than did the usual res­i­dents, the Texas Rangers, who hit just 27 in their 30 games there this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The cham­pi­onship re­flected the Dodgers’ ded­i­ca­tion and com­mit­ment, but it also helped that they had Betts, whom they ac­quired from Bos­ton in a trade in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“I was traded for this rea­son,” the right-fielder said. “I’m proud of my­self and proud of the guys for ac­com­plish­ing it.”</p>
    <p>It took a lit­tle longer than ex­pected, but Roberts sensed their time had come. “I had a crazy feel­ing that came to fruition,” he said. “I just knew that we weren’t go­ing to be de­nied this year.”</p>
