    <p>MOS­COW • Rus­sia’s coro­n­avirus case tally passed the one mil­lion­mark yes­ter­day as schools and ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions re­opened across the world’s largest coun­try with new manda­tory safety pre­cau­tions in place.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has the fourth-high­est case tally in the world af­ter the United States, Brazil and In­dia, ac­cord­ing to Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity, which has been track­ing the virus since it was dis­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>But of­fi­cials say more than 800,000 peo­ple have re­cov­ered from the dis­ease and that, with just over 17,000 deaths, the death toll in Rus­sia is lower than in many other Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus cri­sis cen­tre said yes­ter­day the over­all case tally stood at 1,000,048 af­ter 4,729 new in­fec­tions were re­ported.</p>
    <p>It said 123 new deaths had been con­firmed in the past 24 hours, tak­ing the of­fi­cial death toll to 17,299.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, in a na­tion­wide TV ad­dress, told stu­dents to ob­serve virus safety rules.</p>
    <p>It is manda­tory for teach­ers to wear masks in schools in the cap­i­tal Mos­cow, which has been harder hit by the coro­n­avirus than other parts of Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers are al­lowed to take off their masks in class­rooms when con­duct­ing les­sons, how­ever, pro­vided they keep a safe dis­tance from chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Mos­cow school chil­dren are not re­quired to wear masks in schools. But tra­di­tional cer­e­monies at the start of the school year were can­celled yes­ter­day, and the use of dif­fer­ent class­rooms will be lim­ited to re­duce in­fec­tion risks.</p>
    <p>“I’m not afraid of Covid-19, of course, but I fol­low re­stric­tions,” Daniil Iva­nenko, a ninth-grade stu­dent, told Reuters TV at his school in western Mos­cow yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia said that 167,044 peo­ple are in­fected with the virus.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has the fourth-high­est case tally in the world af­ter the United States, Brazil and In­dia, ac­cord­ing to Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity, which has been track­ing the virus since it was dis­cov­ered. But of­fi­cials say more than 800,000 peo­ple have re­cov­ered from the dis­ease and that, with just over 17,000 deaths, the death toll in Rus­sia is lower than in many other Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
