    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­ports Covid-19 cases in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional prac­tice. Ev­ery case who tested pos­i­tive through a PCR test and is as­sessed to be an acute in­fec­tion is re­ported and in­cluded in our case count. We fol­low the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s cri­te­rion that only pos­i­tive re­sults from con­fir­ma­tory tests (that is, PCR tests) are in­cluded in the case count.</p>
    <p>Eight more ho­tel staff at Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore, af­ter tak­ing sero­log­i­cal tests, have tested pos­i­tive, in­di­cat­ing likely past in­fec­tions of Covid-19, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>They are in ad­di­tion to the three cases an­nounced on Sun­day. Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions of th­ese 11 cases are in progress, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the min­istry is test­ing their iden­ti­fied close con­tacts as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure. It will also con­duct sero­log­i­cal tests to de­ter­mine if th­ese in­di­vid­u­als could have been in­fected by the 11 cases.</p>
    <p>Th­ese cases were ex­cluded from the Covid-19 daily count, the min­istry said, as their poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test re­sults are neg­a­tive for the in­fec­tion, in­di­cat­ing th­ese are likely to be past and not cur­rent in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said: “Sin­ga­pore re­ports Covid-19 cases in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional prac­tice. Ev­ery case who tested pos­i­tive through a PCR test and is as­sessed to be an acute in­fec­tion is re­ported and in­cluded in our case count.</p>
    <p>“We fol­low the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s cri­te­rion that only pos­i­tive re­sults from con­fir­ma­tory tests (that is, PCR tests) are in­cluded in the case count.”</p>
    <p>In to­tal, MOH has tested 571 staff of Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore, and all the PCR test re­sults have come back neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>This means there is no on­go­ing in­fec­tion among staff of the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>MIN­ISTRY OF HEALTH</p>
    <p>Spe­cial test­ing op­er­a­tions to test all in­di­vid­u­als and staff at Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore have been com­pleted, it added.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 394 per­sons serv­ing stay-home no­tice (SHN) at the ho­tel have been swabbed. Of th­ese, three tested pos­i­tive on Sun­day and were im­me­di­ately sent to hos</p>
    <p>pital in an am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>Th­ese cases were in­cluded in the min­istry’s daily case count on Sun­day. As they have re­cent travel his­tory, it is likely th­ese are im­ported cases who were in­fected while they were over­seas, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory will con­duct whole genome se­quenc­ing and phy­lo­ge­netic anal­y­sis to de­ter­mine if they could be linked to 13 other cases.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, MOH an­nounced that it was in­ves­ti­gat­ing 13 cases of Covid-19 in­fec­tion among in­di­vid­u­als who had served SHN at Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore be­tween Oct 22 and Nov 11.</p>
    <p>They were from 10 dif­fer­ent coun­tries and MOH is in­ves­ti­gat­ing if they are linked be­cause they were in­fected by coro­n­avirus strains that have “high ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity”, im­ply­ing that the in­fec­tions may have come from the same source.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, all ex­ist­ing guests at the ho­tel were checked out by 9pm on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Those serv­ing SHN there were taken in ded­i­cated ve­hi­cles to an al­ter­na­tive ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­ity on the same day, said the min­istry.</p>
