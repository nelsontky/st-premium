    <p>The move to give Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh more du­ties and priv­i­leges as the of­fi­cially des­ig­nated Leader of the Op­po­si­tion is a sig­nif­i­cant step in recog­nis­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans’ de­sire for more po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity. The Straits Times looks at how Sin­ga­pore’s par­lia­men­tary sys­tem has evolved through the years.</p>
    <p>As the anti-colo­nial in­de­pen­dence move­ment gath­ered steam in the 1950s, the Bri­tish set up a com­mis­sion in 1953 to rec­om­mend changes to Sin­ga­pore’s con­sti­tu­tional sys­tem.</p>
    <p>A key out­come of this was the for­ma­tion of the Leg­isla­tive As­sem­bly – the pre­de­ces­sor to the Par­lia­ment of Sin­ga­pore – in 1955.</p>
    <p>Re­plac­ing the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil, the ma­jor­ity of seats in the as­sem­bly – 25 out of 32 – were al­lot­ted by elec­tion, rather than ap­point­ment by the colo­nial ad­min­is­tra­tion. But the ad­min­is­tra­tion still re­served con­trol over key as­pects of gov­ern­ment, in­clud­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion, fi­nance, in­ter­nal se­cu­rity and law.</p>
    <p>This be­came a source of fric­tion af­ter the gen­eral elec­tion held that year, when Mr David Mar­shall of the Labour Front took most of the seats in the as­sem­bly and be­came Sin­ga­pore’s first Chief Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing greater self-gov­ern­ment, Mr Mar­shall and his suc­ces­sor, Mr Lim Yew Hock, held talks with the Colo­nial Of­fice in Lon­don – which all par­ties took part in – cul­mi­nat­ing in the 1958 State of Sin­ga­pore Constituti­on.</p>
    <p>The new Constituti­on vested the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment with full in­ter­nal gov­ern­ing pow­ers.</p>
    <p>All 51 seats in the Leg­isla­tive As­sem­bly would be elected, and the gov­er­nor re­placed by the Yang diPer­tuan Ne­gara (head of state), who had pow­ers to ap­point the prime min­is­ter and other Cab­i­net min­is­ters on the prime min­is­ter’s ad­vice.</p>
    <p>In the 1959 Gen­eral Elec­tion, the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) won 43 out of the 51 seats in the as­sem­bly and Mr Lee Kuan Yew be­came the first prime min­is­ter of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore merged with the Fed­er­a­tion of Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak to form Malaysia in 1963, it was al­lo­cated 15 out of 127 seats in the Fed­eral Par­lia­ment in Kuala Lumpur, but kept its own ex­ec­u­tive gov­ern­ment and the Leg­isla­tive As­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>On the Repub­lic’s in­de­pen­dence in 1965, the as­sem­bly was re­named the Par­lia­ment of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber that year, MPs from the op­po­si­tion Barisan Sosialis – com­pris­ing for­mer mem­bers of the PAP who had fought against the PAP gov­ern­ment’s pro­posed terms for merger with the Fed­er­a­tion of Malaya – staged a boy­cott of the first ses­sion of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>They went on to boy­cott the 1968 Gen­eral Elec­tion, which saw only seven out of 58 seats con­tested. Af­ter re­turn­ing to con­test the next few elec­tions with­out suc­cess, the party was dis­solved in 1988 and merged with the Work­ers’ Party (WP).</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Par­lia­ment would not see an op­po­si­tion mem­ber un­til 1981.</p>
    <p>PAR­LIA­MEN­TARY SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment in Sin­ga­pore is mod­elled af­ter the West­min­ster sys­tem, with three sep­a­rate branches: the leg­is­la­ture (the Pres­i­dent and Par­lia­ment), the ex­ec­u­tive (Cab­i­net min­is­ters and of­fice-hold­ers led by the Prime Min­is­ter), and the ju­di­ciary. Be­ing uni­cam­eral, Par­lia­ment has only one House.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to most Com­mon­wealth leg­is­la­tures, a Speaker is elected by MPs at the start of each new Par­lia­ment. He or she pre­sides over par­lia­men­tary sit­tings and en­forces the rules of de­bate, as well as gives guid­ance on House pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>The Speaker may or may not be an MP, but must have the qual­i­fi­ca­tions to stand for elec­tion.</p>
    <p>While most Speak­ers in the 1960s, such as for­mer judges Punch Coomaraswa­my and A.P. Ra­jah, were not MPs, sub­se­quent ones have all been PAP MPs.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that the man­date given by vot­ers re­mains sta­ble un­til the next gen­eral elec­tion – and to avoid MPs chang­ing po­lit­i­cal par­ties within the same term of Par­lia­ment – the Constituti­on states that if an elected MP is no longer a mem­ber of, is ex­pelled from, or re­signs from the party for which he stood in the elec­tion, he will lose his seat in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law don Eu­gene Tan said that along­side the West­min­ster model of par­lia­men­tary demo­cratic gov­ern­ment, Sin­ga­pore has also de­vel­oped an au­tochthonou­s – or na­tional and indige­nous – po­lit­i­cal sys­tem to suit the needs, cir­cum­stances and as­pi­ra­tions of the coun­try as well as its peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“The quest is always to evolve and de­velop a sys­tem of par­lia­men­tary democ­racy that the PAP gov­ern­ment deems best for Sin­ga­pore,” he says.</p>
    <p>“All these changes seek to fur­ther the fun­da­men­tal ob­jec­tive of man­ag­ing the pace of po­lit­i­cal change, by keep­ing the one-party dom­i­nant sys­tem suf­fi­ciently rel­e­vant, ro­bust and re­spon­sive.</p>
    <p>“In­sti­tu­tional re­design is not merely about con­tin­ued po­lit­i­cal con­trol. It is also to en­sure the in­sti­tu­tions re­tain their le­git­i­macy.”</p>
    <p>THE 1980s TO 2000s: MORE AL­TER­NA­TIVE VIEWS AND OP­PO­SI­TION NCMPs</p>
    <p>In 1984, then Prime Min­is­ter Lee pro­posed amend­ments to the Constituti­on and the Par­lia­men­tary Elec­tions Act to al­low be­tween a min­i­mum of three and a max­i­mum of six op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this, there had been no op­po­si­tion MPs elected into Par­lia­ment for nearly 20 years, un­til the WP’s Mr J.B. Je­yaret­nam won the 1981 An­son by-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In propos­ing the change, Mr Lee ar­gued that hav­ing Non-Con­stituency MPs (NCMPs) – the best­per­form­ing los­ing op­po­si­tion can­di­dates in an elec­tion – would en­able younger Sin­ga­pore­ans, who had not wit­nessed first-hand the di­vi­sive pol­i­tics of the 1950s and 1960s, to learn about what an op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment can do.</p>
    <p>The scheme would also pro­vide valu­able train­ing for the younger min­is­ters and MPs, by hon­ing their de­bat­ing skills as they en­gaged with op­po­si­tion MPs.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of, as well as rights ac­corded to, NCMPs have steadily in­creased over time.</p>
    <p>In 2010, a con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment was passed to guar­an­tee at least nine op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment af­ter the polls. If the op­po­si­tion were to win fewer than nine seats, NCMPs would be ap­pointed to make up the short­fall.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced that the min­i­mum num­ber of op­po­si­tion MPs, in­clud­ing NCMPs, would be raised from nine to 12, and they would have equal vot­ing rights as elected MPs.</p>
    <p>The scheme be­came a flash­point in this year’s gen­eral elec­tion, with op­po­si­tion par­ties crit­i­cis­ing it as a ploy to en­tice Sin­ga­pore­ans to vote for the PAP.</p>
    <p>Alju­nied GRC MP and for­mer NCMP Ger­ald Giam spoke of the lim­i­ta­tions of the po­si­tion, not­ing that it is hard to es­tab­lish a base with­out con­stituents to serve and a town to man­age.</p>
    <p>As­sur­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans that Par­lia­ment will always have op­po­si­tion mem­bers, PM Lee noted that NCMPs have full vot­ing rights on Bud­gets, con­sti­tu­tional amend­ments and mo­tions of con­fi­dence, just like elected MPs.</p>
    <p>For­mer prime min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong said the scheme serves as a sta­biliser for a “sam­pan-sized” Sin­ga­pore against an un­in­tended elec­tion out­come. Sin­ga­pore adopts a first-past-the-post sys­tem, which means a can­di­date would be the win­ner even with a one-vote ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>“You can put a sail on the sam­pan, catch the wind and go fast with­out fear of it cap­siz­ing. The NCMP scheme is an im­por­tant out­rig­ger for our po­lit­i­cal sys­tem,” he added.</p>
    <p>SMU’s As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan said the scheme can be crit­i­cised as an at­tempt to per­suade Sin­ga­pore­ans that they need not worry about a one-party dom­i­nant sys­tem, be­cause there will be the man­dated pro­vi­sion of op­po­si­tion MPs.</p>
    <p>But for­mer Clerk of Par­lia­ment P.O. Ram – who worked un­der for­mer Speak­ers Tan Soo Khoon and Ab­dul­lah Tar­mugi in the 1990s and 2000s – thinks the scheme re­mains a good op­por­tu­nity for the best losers in an elec­tion to have a pres­ence in Par­lia­ment. He asked: “Does get­ting rid of it help the op­po­si­tion? The Progress Sin­ga­pore Party’s (PSP) voice can now be heard through the two NCMPs with all the at­ten­dant priv­i­leges.”</p>
    <p>The PSP an­nounced on July 14 that its mem­bers Hazel Poa and Leong Mun Wai – part of the team of “best losers” in West Coast GRC – will take up the bal­ance of two NCMP seats of­fered to the party, af­ter the WP won 10 seats at the polls.</p>
    <p>For­mer PAP MP In­der­jit Singh said that be­cause NCMPs do not rep­re­sent their res­i­dents in Par­lia­ment, they can never claim to have the same level of au­thor­ity as an elected MP.</p>
    <p>But the re­cent changes have given more pow­ers to NCMPs, as col­lec­tively, 12 NCMPs can ini­ti­ate a de­bate or mo­tion and can vote against the PAP’s mo­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>“To­gether with the NMP scheme, the new changes will no doubt raise the level of de­bate in Par­lia­ment, and will re­quire the PAP MPs and min­is­ters to work harder.</p>
    <p>“But this will also lead the PAP to close ranks even more and the Party Whip to be more vig­i­lant and con­trol vot­ing tightly.”</p>
    <p>GOV­ERN­MENT PAR­LIA­MEN­TARY COM­MIT­TEES</p>
    <p>Mooted by Mr Goh in 1987, gov­ern­ment par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tees (GPCs) – whose mem­bers are PAP back­benchers – scru­ti­nise leg­is­la­tion and pol­icy pro­grammes. They also serve as an ad­di­tional feed­back chan­nel on gov­ern­ment poli­cies.</p>
    <p>As there was only one elected op­po­si­tion mem­ber – Mr Chiam See Tong – in Par­lia­ment at the time, Mr Goh, then the Deputy Prime Min­is­ter, wanted GPCs to play the role of an “in­ter­nal or proxy op­po­si­tion”, said Dr Aline Wong, who was among the first batch of GPC chair­men.</p>
    <p>This was also a time when the se­cond gen­er­a­tion of PAP Cab­i­net min­is­ters had emerged and be­gun to take charge of the af­fairs of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh was in­clined to­wards a more con­sul­ta­tive and par­tic­i­pa­tive way of gov­ern­ing, and a num­ber of in­sti­tu­tions ini­ti­ated by him af­ter the 1984 Gen­eral Elec­tion re­flect this dif­fer­ent style, in­clud­ing the Feed­back Unit, In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies and GPCs.</p>
    <p>There are now 12 GPCs, each cov­er­ing a pol­icy do­main that roughly mir­rors the var­i­ous min­istries. Some have suc­cess­fully pushed for pol­icy changes – like MP Liang Eng Hwa who asked for the pol­icy of not build­ing new hawker cen­tres to be re­versed, shortly af­ter he be­came a mem­ber of the GPC for the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources in 2011.</p>
    <p>He raised this to then En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakrishn­an, who per­suaded the Cab­i­net of its mer­its, and the min­istry an­nounced the build­ing of 10 new hawker cen­tres later that year.</p>
    <p>Should GPCs even­tu­ally evolve to in­clude not just MPs from the PAP, but also MPs from other par­ties and Nom­i­nated MPs (NMPs) as well?</p>
    <p>Mr Goh him­self raised it as a po­ten­tial de­vel­op­ment for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In a speech to civil ser­vants in Fe­bru­ary 1987, just be­fore GPCs for­mally be­gan, he said: “GPCs are not sim­i­lar to Select Com­mit­tees, which in­clude rep­re­sen­ta­tion from all par­ties in Par­lia­ment. Whether they evolve into Select Com­mit­tees will de­pend on our ex­pe­ri­ence with them.”</p>
    <p>Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity pro­fes­sor Hong Hai, a PAP MP from 1988 to 1991, first sug­gested the idea of form­ing GPCs to Mr Goh be­fore the 1988 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But he said the GPCs he had in mind were more sim­i­lar to United States con­gres­sional com­mit­tees, which are bi­par­ti­san in com­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>With only MPs of the rul­ing party, Prof Hong said, there may be a ten­dency for GPCs to merely be com­ple­men­tary to the min­istries they fall un­der – and to be strongly sup­port­ive of any pro­posed poli­cies.</p>
    <p>There is a dan­ger that they may not re­view crit­i­cally, or even change the tra­jec­tory of, cer­tain ini­tia­tives, he added. “In­clud­ing NMPs and MPs from the WP and Progress Sin­ga­pore Party in par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tees may al­low more ro­bust de­bate to take place, re­sult­ing in bet­ter thought-out poli­cies.”</p>
    <p>NOM­I­NATED MPs</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment in­tro­duced an­other con­sti­tu­tional in­no­va­tion in 1990: the Nom­i­nated MP scheme.</p>
    <p>Like NCMPs, NMPs are un­elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives, cho­sen by a Select Com­mit­tee of Par­lia­ment and rec­om­mended for ap­point­ment by the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>They must have a record of dis­tin­guished pub­lic ser­vice, or have ex­celled in fields such as the arts, sciences, busi­ness, com­mu­nity ser­vice or the labour move­ment.</p>
    <p>Each NMP serves a term of 21/</p>
    <p>2 years and may be reap­pointed af­ter the term ends.</p>
