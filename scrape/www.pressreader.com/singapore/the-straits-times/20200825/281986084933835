    <p>We are start­ing a new term of Govern­ment un­der the shadow of Covid-19. Sin­ga­pore has been fully en­gaged in this fight. New in­fec­tions have been brought un­der con­trol. We have com­pleted test­ing all the mi­grant work­ers in the dor­mi­to­ries, and are pro­gres­sively re­turn­ing them to work safely. Fa­tal­i­ties have been kept very low.</p>
    <p>But the sit­u­a­tion con­tin­ues to un­fold. Many cities that had ini­tially sup­pressed the virus are see­ing in­fec­tions rise again as they re­open their economies. Sci­en­tists are still learn­ing new things about the virus – in­clud­ing how best to pro­tect our­selves, and how new med­i­cal treat­ments and vac­cines can help.</p>
    <p>We must there­fore ad­just our Covid-19 strate­gies and plans along the way.</p>
    <p>We have pre­pared our health­care sys­tem and ex­panded re­serve ca­pac­ity to deal with a pos­si­ble resur­gence of cases. We are con­tin­u­ing to ramp up our abil­ity to con­duct ag­gres­sive test­ing and con­tact trac­ing. Most im­por­tantly, all of us must stay vig­i­lant to pre­vent a new wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>At the same time, we are fac­ing our worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence. Our econ­omy will likely shrink by 5 per cent to 7 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has acted de­ci­sively to save jobs and pro­vide emer­gency sup­port to work­ers and com­pa­nies. We are in­ject­ing al­most $100 bil­lion into the econ­omy, in­clud­ing the lat­est pack­age that Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced last week. Th­ese mea­sures have re­duced the im­me­di­ate pain, but things will re­main grave for quite some time.</p>
    <p>IM­PER­A­TIVES FOR CHANGE</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tions glob­ally and do­mes­ti­cally have changed and there is no go­ing back to the sta­tus quo ante.</p>
    <p>For decades, Sin­ga­pore has thrived un­der glob­al­i­sa­tion and a sta­ble in­ter­na­tional or­der. But our ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment has be­come less be­nign and pre­dictable. Covid-19 has reshuf­fled the deck. It has re­vealed new threats, while also open­ing up fresh op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Global fault lines have sharp­ened, and US-China ri­valry has in­ten­si­fied. Sup­ply chains have been dis­rupted. Coun­tries are fight­ing to meet their own needs, fu­elling a new wave of pro­tec­tion­ism. This is es­pe­cially chal­leng­ing for Sin­ga­pore as we make our liv­ing by do­ing busi­ness with the world.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­ti­cally, Sin­ga­pore is at an in­flec­tion point of our his­tory.</p>
    <p>New gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans are com­ing of age. We have new as­pi­ra­tions and ex­pec­ta­tions, in­clud­ing a de­sire for more di­verse voices to be heard, and stronger checks and bal­ances. At the same time, new lead­ers are emerg­ing to take Sin­ga­pore the next steps for­ward.</p>
    <p>The new gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers and Sin­ga­pore­ans will have to form bonds and con­nec­tions afresh, forge their own com­pact, find their own ways of work­ing to­gether and strike their own bal­ances.</p>
    <p>They have to con­tinue to de­liver ef­fec­tive and sound govern­ment, while ac­com­mo­dat­ing the grow­ing di­ver­sity of views. And they have to fos­ter a more open spirit in our so­ci­ety, even as we strengthen the com­mon cause hold­ing us to­gether as Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue to suc­ceed, we need to un­der­stand th­ese changes in our ex­ter­nal and do­mes­tic en­vi­ron­ments, re­think our prob­lems and im­prove on the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will con­tinue to evolve our eco­nomic and so­cial mod­els and our poli­cies to suit the new cir­cum­stances. We will en­cour­age cit­i­zen ini­tia­tives and par­tic­i­pa­tion. We will lis­ten to and ex­am­ine novel ideas ob­jec­tively, recog­nis­ing that no so­lu­tions are right for all time.</p>
    <p>Some­times, stay­ing the course will re­main the best way for­ward and we must con­vince Sin­ga­pore­ans to per­se­vere. Other prob­lems will re­quire fresh ap­proaches and the courage to take a dif­fer­ent di­rec­tion. In all cases, we will seek to do what is best for Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>De­spite the sea change in our en­vi­ron­ment, one thing re­mains con­stant: Sin­ga­pore is still a lit­tle red dot in an un­cer­tain world. To sur­vive and thrive, we must stand out com­pared to other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>We need to be more re­silient and nim­ble than oth­ers in re­spond­ing to change. We must do things that oth­ers can­not do, and do the things that oth­ers can do, even bet­ter.</p>
    <p>This re­quires us to reach a broad con­sen­sus on the eco­nomic and so­cial changes nec­es­sary, the Sin­ga­porean iden­tity we as­pire to forge, and the kind of pol­i­tics we want to have.</p>
    <p>SE­CUR­ING JOBS FOR SIN­GA­PORE­ANS</p>
    <p>We recog­nise the fears and anx­i­eties about jobs that Sin­ga­pore­ans have to­day. Covid-19 has am­pli­fied the pres­sures caused by a slow­ing global econ­omy in re­cent years, es­pe­cially on cer­tain groups of work­ers, such as our lower-wage work­ers, ma­ture work­ers and mid-ca­reer Sin­ga­pore­ans with heav­ier fi­nan­cial com­mit­ments and fam­i­lies to sup­port.</p>
    <p>Jobs will re­main our top pri­or­ity for the next few years. Keep­ing peo­ple in work is the best way to help them take care of their fam­i­lies, and to keep their skills cur­rent un­til the econ­omy im­proves.</p>
    <p>We are do­ing all we can to help. We are sup­port­ing busi­nesses, es­pe­cially SMEs, with cash flow and credit so that they stay afloat and hold on to their work­ers. The Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil is work­ing closely with tri­par­tite part­ners to cre­ate new job and skills up­grad­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>We will con­tinue to look out for our lower-wage and ma­ture work­ers, many of whom are also es­sen­tial work­ers who have been keep­ing Sin­ga­pore go­ing dur­ing the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>We are also making a con­certed ef­fort to help work­ers in their 40s and 50s, by match­ing them to suit­able jobs and Skill­sFu­ture pro­grammes. I urge em­ploy­ers to see mid-ca­reer Sin­ga­pore­ans as valu­able as­sets, and pro­vide them with op­por­tu­ni­ties and train­ing for new jobs.</p>
    <p>To sus­tain job cre­ation, we must keep our econ­omy strong and com­pet­i­tive. Our econ­omy will un­dergo sig­nif­i­cant struc­tural changes. Some sec­tors will not re­turn to what they were be­fore.</p>
    <p>Some jobs will dis­ap­pear al­to­gether. Much of our econ­omy thrives be­cause we have made our­selves a vibrant hub for the re­gion and an at­trac­tive place for trade, in­vest­ments, tal­ent and ideas. We can­not take our hub sta­tus for granted, or as­sume that its scope and role will re­main the same.</p>
    <p>There is there­fore great ur­gency to trans­form our econ­omy and find new ways to make a liv­ing.</p>
    <p>We will re­sume air travel safely, to main­tain Sin­ga­pore’s role as a global and re­gional hub. We will strengthen dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity and help com­pa­nies de­velop their links to new mar­kets. Our ef­forts to for­tify our re­silience in crit­i­cal ar­eas like food, health­care and sup­ply chain man­age­ment can be­come new sources of growth.</p>
    <p>We will also make a ma­jor push for sus­tain­able growth. We will reimag­ine how we plan our city, re­design ur­ban mo­bil­ity and grow us­ing less re­sources in a low-car­bon fu­ture. We will push for green fi­nanc­ing and sus­tain­able in­fra­struc­ture devel­op­ment across the re­gion, to ride on Asia’s growth while pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>With cre­ativ­ity and re­source­ful­ness, we can turn our as­pi­ra­tions for a greener Sin­ga­pore into a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>BUILD­ING A FAIR AND JUST SO­CI­ETY</p>
    <p>While we pur­sue eco­nomic growth to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, we must also share the ben­e­fits of progress widely with all cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>We started strength­en­ing our so­cial safety nets more than a decade ago. In this cri­sis, we have im­ple­mented many emer­gency mea­sures to help Sin­ga­pore­ans cope. Th­ese are tem­po­rary re­lief mea­sures, but we do ex­pect a per­ma­nent shift to a new nor­mal af­ter the cri­sis. We are en­ter­ing an era of volatil­ity, un­cer­tainty and dis­rup­tion in peo­ple’s lives. In­di­vid­u­als will need greater so­cial sup­port than be­fore.</p>
    <p>We will have to con­sider care­fully how to strengthen our safety nets, to give Sin­ga­pore­ans more as­sur­ance cop­ing with life’s un­cer­tain­ties. And we will have to be care­ful to do so in a way that is fi­nan­cially sus­tain­able for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>As part of this shift in so­cial pol­icy, the Govern­ment will do more to sup­port every Sin­ga­porean, at each stage of life, to build a stronger and more co­he­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>We will sup­port young fam­i­lies to own their homes, and to im­prove their own and their chil­dren’s lives through qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing path­ways. We will of­fer mid­dle-aged Sin­ga­pore­ans more help to se­cure good jobs and greater as­sur­ance of re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy. We will take good care of our se­niors to en­able them to age well and with dig­nity.</p>
    <p>But more re­dis­tri­bu­tion can­not be the only way to level up those who are do­ing less well. We also have to con­tinue strength­en­ing so­cial mo­bil­ity and broad­en­ing our con­cep­tion of merit.</p>
    <p>Mer­i­toc­racy has been a cru­cial pil­lar of our so­ci­ety. It has served us well over the past 55 years. How­ever, just as our so­cial norms and poli­cies have evolved in tan­dem with Sin­ga­pore’s devel­op­ment, so too must our model of mer­i­toc­racy.</p>
    <p>We recog­nise that un­fet­tered mer­i­toc­racy can fos­ter ex­ces­sive com­pe­ti­tion. We also re­alise the need to level up fam­i­lies who are at a dis­ad­van­tage, and give their chil­dren a fair start in life.</p>
    <p>We want to keep our so­ci­ety open and so­cially mo­bile, and not al­low it to strat­ify and os­sify over time.</p>
    <p>That is why we have made a con­certed ef­fort to value a wide range of tal­ent. Schools and in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing ad­mit stu­dents through yard­sticks other than aca­demic re­sults. The Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion has widened its catch­ment of schol­ars.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers are en­cour­aged to hire peo­ple based on skills, with the pub­lic ser­vice tak­ing the lead. Po­lit­i­cal par­ties are field­ing can­di­dates who took dif­fer­ent life paths and have di­verse tal­ents and strengths.</p>
    <p>This is also why we must con­tinue to in­vest heav­ily in ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing, from the ear­li­est years of child­hood through the school­ing years. We are de­vel­op­ing many path­ways, so that young Sin­ga­pore­ans can achieve their fullest po­ten­tial re­gard­less of their start­ing point.</p>
    <p>And through the next bound of Skill­sFu­ture, we will en­able every worker to up­skill and progress through­out their ca­reer, be­yond their ini­tial qual­i­fi­ca­tions. Em­ploy­ers must sup­port life­long learn­ing as the new norm. So­ci­ety must value peo­ple for what they con­trib­ute, in every job and every role.</p>
    <p>Build­ing a fair and just so­ci­ety goes be­yond govern­ment ac­tions. It re­quires the sup­port and par­tic­i­pa­tion of all Sin­ga­pore­ans. It turns on how we look af­ter our most vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers, such as help­ing stu­dents from dis­ad­van­taged fam­i­lies through Up­lift and KidS­tart, pro­vid­ing train­ing and job op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, and bridg­ing the dig­i­tal di­vide for our se­niors.</p>
    <p>We have made progress over the last decade, and we will do much more in this term of Govern­ment to see our peo­ple through this cri­sis and be­yond. The more closely knit we are as a peo­ple, the fur­ther we can move ahead as a na­tion.</p>
    <p>STRENGTH­EN­ING OUR SIN­GA­POREAN IDEN­TITY</p>
    <p>In the longer term, the key to Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess lies in our sense of shared iden­tity. Sin­ga­pore can en­dure and se­cure her place in his­tory only if Sin­ga­pore­ans feel pas­sion­ately about our coun­try, and put our hearts and souls into making this a bet­ter home.</p>
    <p>Since in­de­pen­dence, we have grad­u­ally built a dis­tinc­tive Sin­ga­porean cul­ture and iden­tity. Re­gard­less of race, lan­guage and re­li­gion, we all think of our­selves as Sin­ga­pore­ans. You can see this in our at­ti­tudes, mem­o­ries and ex­pe­ri­ences; it is in our arts and her­itage, and the way we cheer for Team Sin­ga­pore to­gether. You see it in the way we can gladly iden­tify one another in an un­fa­mil­iar for­eign land, and the way we have each other’s backs in a cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are emo­tional ties that are strength­ened over the years.</p>
    <p>There is still much more to do to strengthen the sense of to­geth­er­ness in our so­ci­ety. We must start young and shape the mul­ti­cul­tural in­stincts in our chil­dren early in life; our ap­proaches and meth­ods must there­fore evolve with the out­look and at­ti­tudes of the young. We must then sus­tain this mind­set across our com­mu­ni­ties and work­places.</p>
    <p>We must also recog­nise that larger forces are at play that test our sol­i­dar­ity and pull us in dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions. The so­cial me­dia has am­pli­fied con­tend­ing voices and views. We are more ex­posed than ever to causes, at­ti­tudes and val­ues from other so­ci­eties that may not be rel­e­vant to our so­cial con­text, but will in­flu­ence us nonethe­less. Eco­nomic dis­tress aris­ing from Covid-19, or so­cial in­equal­ity, can breed a sense of in­se­cu­rity amongst dif­fer­ent groups of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Mul­tira­cial­ism will al­ways be a core el­e­ment of our Sin­ga­porean iden­tity. Ev­ery­one, re­gard­less of race, lan­guage, or re­li­gion, must have an equal place in our so­ci­ety. Here in Sin­ga­pore, we em­brace our plu­ral­ity and di­ver­sity, even as we con­tinue to de­velop a stronger Sin­ga­porean ethos and strive to­gether to be­come more than the sum of our in­di­vid­ual parts.</p>
    <p>But our mul­tira­cial­ism is still a work in progress. Each suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tion will bring dif­fer­ent life ex­pe­ri­ences and per­spec­tives. In each gen­er­a­tion, some will want to dis­cuss sen­si­tive is­sues afresh. Younger Sin­ga­pore­ans pre­fer talk­ing about th­ese is­sues more can­didly and openly, which is a pos­i­tive devel­op­ment. But the con­ver­sa­tion needs to be con­ducted with re­straint and mu­tual re­spect, be­cause race, lan­guage and re­li­gion will al­ways be vis­ceral sub­jects. If each group pushes its own agenda to the ex­treme, we risk erod­ing the com­mon space and frac­tur­ing our so­cial co­he­sion.</p>
    <p>Another po­ten­tially di­vi­sive is­sue closely con­nected to our Sin­ga­porean iden­tity is the sense of com­pe­ti­tion for jobs from work pass hold­ers. This has be­come a ma­jor source of anx­i­ety, es­pe­cially among mid-ca­reer Sin­ga­pore­ans. We un­der­stand th­ese con­cerns. They not only touch on mat­ters of liveli­hood, but also on our sense of iden­tity and be­long­ing. They will be ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>As masters of our own land, Sin­ga­pore­ans must have con­fi­dence in the rights and priv­i­leges of cit­i­zen­ship. Our strong ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem and train­ing path­ways have pro­duced a work­force that can com­pete against the best in the world. We will work with em­ploy­ers to fur­ther strengthen the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of our work­force in every field, and en­sure that firms treat Sin­ga­pore­ans fairly when they recruit or re­trench work­ers. In all that we do, the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans are al­ways para­mount.</p>
    <p>At the same time, we must not turn in­wards, away from the world. We must keep our hearts open to those who come from be­yond our shores. We should con­tinue to wel­come and in­te­grate those who can con­trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore, and im­prove our lives and our chil­dren’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Our Sin­ga­porean iden­tity has been formed and strength­ened not by ex­clud­ing those who ar­rive later, but by suc­ces­sive ar­rivals adding to the rich­ness of our so­ci­ety. Th­ese are emo­tive is­sues that can evoke strong re­ac­tions. De­bates on such sen­si­tive mat­ters can eas­ily be­come po­larised. So as we open up more ar­eas for mean­ing­ful dis­cus­sion, Sin­ga­pore­ans must work even harder to lis­ten to and un­der­stand one another.</p>
    <p>We must break out of the echo cham­bers that form so eas­ily on­line, and make gen­uine at­tempts to bridge the gap with those who think dif­fer­ently from us. We must strive to ob­tain greater in­sight, build shared un­der­stand­ing and use our di­verse per­spec­tives and ideas to achieve bet­ter out­comes for all.</p>
    <p>EVOLV­ING OUR POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>Th­ese must also be the guid­ing prin­ci­ples of our pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment is the cen­tral plat­form to de­bate na­tional poli­cies and set the tone for our po­lit­i­cal dis­course.</p>
    <p>One sig­nif­i­cant change in this term is the des­ig­na­tion of a Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, re­flect­ing the larger num­ber of Op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment. The Govern­ment and the Op­po­si­tion both have roles to play to build trust in our pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions, and achieve good out­comes for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Given the mag­ni­tude of the chal­lenges and un­cer­tain­ties, we must ex­pect to en­counter more dif­fer­ences in views and in­ter­ests among Sin­ga­pore­ans. We must learn to han­dle th­ese dif­fer­ences con­struc­tively. On some is­sues, we can agree to dis­agree. But on is­sues core to Sin­ga­pore and our sur­vival and fu­ture, we must do our best to find com­mon ground and build a broad con­sen­sus.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will be open to con­struc­tive crit­i­cism and ra­tio­nal de­bate, and to new ways of do­ing things. But the Govern­ment, hav­ing been elected by the peo­ple, must also gov­ern for all our peo­ple. It can­not shy away from tak­ing dif­fi­cult and tough de­ci­sions in the na­tional in­ter­est, or shirk the duty of win­ning sup­port for such de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>The Op­po­si­tion too has its part to play. In Par­lia­ment, be­sides rais­ing ques­tions and crit­i­cisms, the Op­po­si­tion should also pro­pose pol­icy al­ter­na­tives to be scru­ti­nised and de­bated. And when the sit­u­a­tion de­mands, both the Govern­ment and Op­po­si­tion should set aside dif­fer­ences and work to­gether to se­cure the safety and fu­ture of our na­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans’ ex­pec­ta­tions and choices will de­ter­mine what kind of pol­i­tics Sin­ga­pore will have. The key question is how to forge a com­mon cause to­gether, re­gard­less of our own po­lit­i­cal in­cli­na­tions. We need to base our rhetoric on a re­spon­si­ble sense of the re­al­i­ties, and come to a shared un­der­stand­ing about our goals and con­straints.</p>
    <p>Our pub­lic de­bates should be hon­est and open about the trade-offs of dif­fer­ent op­tions and what they will cost so­ci­ety. Only in this way will our sys­tem con­tinue to en­cour­age able and com­mit­ted in­di­vid­u­als to step for­ward to serve.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE TO­GETHER – THE NEXT PHASE OF NA­TION BUILD­ING</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, we want Sin­ga­pore to evolve in a way that en­gages the as­pi­ra­tions and cre­ative en­er­gies of all our peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans as­pire to make this a bet­ter place, and have in­ter­est­ing and di­verse ideas to pur­sue. Such a di­ver­sity of views and ideas can be a source of strength for us to nav­i­gate the chal­lenges and pos­si­bil­i­ties ahead.</p>
    <p>To re­alise this strength, we need a sense of com­mon pur­pose, and a readi­ness to act to make a dif­fer­ence to causes we care about. Sin­ga­pore­ans must come to­gether, in part­ner­ship, to pur­sue the greater good, united by a be­lief in Sin­ga­pore and a de­sire to turn our vi­sion into re­al­ity. This is the spirit of Sin­ga­pore To­gether.</p>
    <p>We in­vite all Sin­ga­pore­ans to part­ner each other and the Govern­ment in this jour­ney.</p>
    <p>CON­CLU­SION</p>
    <p>In the com­ing years, we will con­front ma­jor changes in the world. But we can face the fu­ture with con­fi­dence, hav­ing built up deep strengths since our in­de­pen­dence. Our pi­o­neers pre­vailed against great odds to build Sin­ga­pore, and it is now our turn to tackle this cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>How we re­spond to the pan­demic and eco­nomic cri­sis will de­fine Sin­ga­pore for many years to come. We must con­tinue to com­mand con­fi­dence and re­spect in the world, and emerge a stronger and more united na­tion.</p>
    <p>So let us work in close part­ner­ship, as Sin­ga­pore To­gether – one peo­ple unit­ing be­hind our elected Govern­ment – to save lives, pro­tect liveli­hoods, and se­cure a brighter fu­ture for our­selves and our chil­dren.</p>
