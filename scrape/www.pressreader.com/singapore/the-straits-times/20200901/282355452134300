    <p>The Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity (Acra) is look­ing into the reg­is­tra­tion of a firm linked to the Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group, which has come un­der in­creased scru­tiny fol­low­ing news of its bid for English Premier League foot­ball club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s state­ment came on the same day that Ax­ing­ton, a Catal­ist-listed com­pany linked to the BN Group, re­quested be­fore the stock market opened that trad­ing in its shares be sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Acra was re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times yes­ter­day on some of the firm’s 31 en­ti­ties, such as Novena Global Life­care, which could not be found in Acra records.</p>
    <p>Novena Global Life­care, a med­i­cal health­care and aes­thet­ics group, has been noted in me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>An Acra spokesman said: “While com­pa­nies could at times use a dif­fer­ent name for brand­ing pur­pose, they have to in­clude the reg­is­tered com­pany name and reg­is­tra­tion num­ber in all busi­ness cor­re­spon­dences to en­sure the pub­lic know who they are do­ing busi­ness with.”</p>
    <p>Car­ry­ing on a busi­ness with­out reg­is­tra­tion is an of­fence pun­ish­able with a fine of up to $5,000 or im­pris­on­ment for a term not ex­ceed­ing 12 months or both.</p>
    <p>The BN Group was co-founded by cousins Nel­son and Ter­ence Loh and Chi­nese gem mer­chant Evan­ge­line Shen. It hit the spot­light af­ter it was called out for doc­tored im­ages of the founders with for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama. Other in­con­sis­ten­cies in public­ity ma­te­ri­als also sur­faced.</p>
    <p>The Loh cousins are also con­trol­ling share­hold­ers of Ax­ing­ton, while Ms Shen is its non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man.</p>
    <p>The firm had called for the vol­un­tary sus­pen­sion pend­ing the re­lease of an an­nounce­ment “in re­la­tion to strate­gic changes to be made in the busi­ness direc­tion of the com­pany”.</p>
    <p>Last week, Ax­ing­ton post­poned an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing where share­hold­ers were due to vote on the firm’s name change to NETX and a shift in its core busi­ness, among other things.</p>
    <p>Acra added that it will also take en­force­ment action against two com­pa­nies linked to the Loh cousins for fail­ing to file their an­nual re­turns.</p>
    <p>Firms that file late must pay a penalty, while those that fail to file will be sub­ject to en­force­ment ac­tions, in­clud­ing prose­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>The of­fence car­ries a max­i­mum fine of $5,000. Acra can seek higher fines for firms with multiple breaches.</p>
