    <p>Iso­lated com­mu­ni­ties with ec­cen­tric, in­scrutable res­i­dents make for ex­cel­lent dra­matic back­drops, but they are par­tic­u­larly help­ful in psy­cho­log­i­cal thrillers such as The Third Day, a six-part lim­ited se­ries star­ring Jude Law (The Tal­ented Mr Ri­p­ley) and Naomie Har­ris (Sky­fall).</p>
    <p>Law is Sam, a man who be­comes stranded on Osea, a mys­te­ri­ous is­land some­where off the coast of Bri­tain, con­nected to the main­land by a cause­way that is underwater most of the time.</p>
    <p>He finds him­self there af­ter help­ing a young girl from the com­mu­nity, which seems at once in­su­lar and wel­com­ing. Its res­i­dents prac­tise a re­li­gion that looks like a bizarre mish­mash of Chris­tian and pa­gan be­liefs.</p>
    <p>It soon be­comes ap­par­ent, though, that Sam is a lit­tle strange him­self, and has left be­hind a com­pli­cated home life and con­sid­er­able per­sonal trauma.</p>
    <p>His men­tal state and un­ease are am­pli­fied by the odd things he sees on the is­land, from dis­em­bow­elled an­i­mals to tense en­coun­ters be­tween its res­i­dents, all of whom seem to be hid­ing some­thing.</p>
    <p>The set-up is re­mark­ably sim­i­lar to that of the fan­tas­tic psy­cho­log­i­cal hor­ror film Mid­som­mar (2019), where a group of out­siders find them­selves trapped in a re­mote Swedish vil­lage with some pe­cu­liar tra­di­tions.</p>
    <p>In the five episodes pro­vided for re­view, The Third Day scores high on at­mos­phere, cul­ti­vat­ing an air of claus­tro­pho­bia and slow-build­ing dread as Sam finds out more about the is­landers.</p>
    <p>But once you strip away the at­mo­spher­ics, the nar­ra­tive feels un­nec­es­sar­ily tor­tu­ous and, as a psy­cho­log­i­cal drama about grief, some­what over­wrought.</p>
    <p>The se­ries is co-cre­ated by stage di­rec­tor Felix Bar­ratt. Af­ter the first three episodes, mem­bers of his in­ter­ac­tive the­atre troupe, Punch­drunk, will per­form a the­atri­cal event star­ring Law and Kather­ine Water­ston – who plays an­other out­sider on the is­land – recre­at­ing a day’s events in real time.</p>
    <p>It will be broad­cast live on­line but, hav­ing watched episodes four and five with­out hav­ing seen the live episode, this el­e­ment of the show feels a bit gim­micky and su­per­flu­ous.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal three episodes in­tro­duce a new pro­tag­o­nist, Helen (Har­ris), who has come to the is­land with her two young daugh­ters and seems to be flee­ing de­mons of her own.</p>
    <p>You won’t have to wait long to find out what hap­pened to Sam, how­ever, and the show’s brevity may be one of its sav­ing graces.</p>
    <p>The Ri­d­ley Scott se­ries Raised By Wolves opens with a sci­ence-fic­tion take on the Adam and Eve tale – ex­cept the cou­ple in ques­tion are two an­droids named Mother (Amanda Collin) and Fa­ther (Abubakar Salim).</p>
    <p>Put on a space­ship with a dozen hu­man em­bryos and sent to a dusty planet, they have to some­how raise a group of chil­dren there – a task they carry out with ut­most dili­gence and care.</p>
    <p>But the first wrin­kle is that the planet is barely live­able; the sec­ond is that they are even­tu­ally joined by an­other band of colonists flee­ing Earth, which has been en­gulfed by a war be­tween a group of athe­ists – the ones who sent their chil­dren away with Mother and Fa­ther – and a re­li­gious fac­tion</p>
    <p>known as the Mithraics.</p>
    <p>Cre­ated by Aaron Guzikowski (Pris­on­ers, 2013) and pro­duced by Scott (Blade Run­ner, 1982, Alien, 1979), who also di­rected the first two episodes, the show crosses off many of the usual sci-fi tropes, from its vaguely post-apoc­a­lyp­tic premise and the idea of re­build­ing civil­i­sa­tion on a new planet, to won­der­ing just how sen­tient these an­droids are.</p>
    <p>But what dis­tin­guishes the se­ries is its thought­ful look at us­ing be­liefs and fairy tales as the build­ing blocks of so­ci­ety – some­thing the athe­ists end up do­ing as much as the Mithraics, with even Mother and Fa­ther spin­ning fa­bles to keep the chil­dren in line.</p>
    <p>Mother – who learns she is not just a care­taker an­droid but a “ne­cro­mancer” model that dou­bles as a killing ma­chine – is not keen on shar­ing the planet with the</p>
    <p>Mithraic ar­rivals and a show­down looms.</p>
    <p>Yet the se­ries is just as in­ter­ested in its philo­soph­i­cal agenda, which might frus­trate view­ers just look­ing for an ac­tion-packed space ad­ven­ture, but is a re­fresh­ing change from the norm.</p>
    <p>And with two of the Mithraics ac­tu­ally athe­ists in dis­guise, the show plays with the no­tion that some­times hu­mans – not just robots – are the ones try­ing to pass a Tur­ing test and con­vince other hu­mans that they be­long. Blade Run­ner fans will ap­pre­ci­ate this.</p>
