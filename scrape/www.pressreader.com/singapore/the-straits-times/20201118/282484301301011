    <p>Some en­light­ened doc­tors, nurses and ther­a­pists have a pre­scrip­tion for helping all of us get through this seem­ingly never-end­ing pan­demic: Try a lit­tle laugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Hu­mour is not just a dis­trac­tion from the grim re­al­ity of the crisis, said Dr Michael Miller, a car­di­ol­o­gist at the Univer­sity of Mary­land School of Medicine in Bal­ti­more. It is also a win­ning strat­egy to stay healthy in the face of it.</p>
    <p>“Height­ened stress mag­ni­fies the risk of car­dio­vas­cu­lar events, in­clud­ing heart at­tacks and strokes,” he said. “Hav­ing a good sense of hu­mour is an ex­cel­lent way to re­lieve stress and anx­i­ety and bring back a sense of nor­malcy dur­ing th­ese tur­bu­lent times.”</p>
    <p>Laugh­ter re­leases ni­tric ox­ide, a chem­i­cal that re­laxes blood ves­sels, re­duces blood pres­sure and de­creases clot­ting, Dr Miller said.</p>
    <p>An epi­demi­o­log­i­cal study of older men and women in Ja­pan con­firmed that those who tend to laugh more have a lower risk of ma­jor car­dio­vas­cu­lar ill­ness. Pos­sess­ing a healthy sense of hu­mour is also as­so­ci­ated with liv­ing longer, an epi­demi­o­log­i­cal study from Nor­way re­ported, although the cor­re­la­tion ap­pears to be stronger for women than for men.</p>
    <p>Armed with this grow­ing body of re­search, Dr Miller pre­scribes “one good belly laugh a day” for his pa­tients. It is not go­ing “ha, ha”, but a “deep phys­i­o­log­i­cal laugh that elic­its tears of joys and re­lax­ation”.</p>
    <p>While the long-term im­pact of such a prac­tice re­mains un­known, neu­ro­sci­en­tist So­phie Scott of Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don said laugh­ter has been shown to re­duce the stress hor­mones cor­ti­sol and adren­a­line and in­crease the body’s up­take of the feel-good en­dor­phins.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing a funny video was tied to im­prove­ments in short-term mem­ory in older adults and in­creased their ca­pac­ity to learn, re­search by Dr Gurinder Singh Bains of Loma Linda Univer­sity in Cal­i­for­nia found.</p>
    <p>Per­haps most rel­e­vant to­day, pos­sess­ing a sense of hu­mour also helps peo­ple re­main re­silient in the face of ad­verse cir­cum­stances, said Dr Ge­orge Bo­nanno, a pro­fes­sor of clin­i­cal psy­chol­ogy at Columbia Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>In one study, he in­ter­viewed young women who had been sex­u­ally abused and noted their fa­cial ex­pres­sions. “Those who man­aged to laugh or smile at moments dur­ing their in­ter­view were more likely to be do­ing bet­ter two years later than those who had not,” he said. “Hu­mour keeps neg­a­tive emo­tions in check and gives us a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive, al­low­ing us to see some of the bad things that hap­pen to us as a chal­lenge, rather than a threat.”</p>
    <p>Hu­mour and tragedy may be more in­ti­mately con­nected than one would think. “Char­lie Chap­lin once said, ‘To truly laugh, you need to be able to take your pain and play with it,’” said Mr Paul Os­in­cup, pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion for Ap­plied and Ther­a­peu­tic Hu­mour.</p>
    <p>“Write down all of the most dif­fi­cult and an­noy­ing things about quar­an­tine,” he rec­om­mends. “Play with those. See if you can find any hu­mour in your sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly, hu­mour is be­ing in­te­grated into main­stream med­i­cal prac­tice with a sim­i­lar goal, said Dr Kari Phillips, a res­i­dent physi­cian at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Min­nesota.</p>
    <p>She ob­served over 100 clin­i­cal en­coun­ters and dis­cov­ered that hu­mour typ­i­cally sur­faces about twice dur­ing a half-hour doc­tor visit. It is ini­ti­ated in equal mea­sure by doc­tors and pa­tients, of­ten to break the ice or to help to soften the im­pact of a dif­fi­cult med­i­cal con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“We f ound that in­tro­duc­ing hu­mour re­sults in bet­ter pa­tient satisfacti­on and em­pow­er­ment, and it helps peo­ple feel more warmth in their con­nec­tion with the doc­tor,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Peter Vic­cel­lio, a pro­fes­sor of emer­gency medicine at Stony Brook Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal on Long Is­land, has seen many Covid-19 pa­tients dur­ing his hours in the emer­gency room. A touch of play­ful­ness and kindly hu­mour, he said, has helped to ease a painful sit­u­a­tion for both his pa­tients and mem­bers of the over­bur­dened hos­pi­tal staff.</p>
    <p>“If you are em­pa­thetic with the per­son, your hu­mour tends to fit them, it’s not forced. If you are not emo­tion­ally con­nected to them and force a joke, it can go very wrong.”</p>
    <p>Other kinds of jok­ing that are po­ten­tially de­struc­tive, he said, are the in-group hu­mour that mocks pa­tients or other mem­bers of the hos­pi­tal staff, and gal­lows hu­mour. And one needs to be care­ful not to ap­pear to be mak­ing light of some­body else’s pain.</p>
    <p>De­spite th­ese po­ten­tial pit­falls, some hos­pi­tals have ini­ti­ated for­mal hu­mour pro­grammes, mak­ing funny books and videos avail­able and invit­ing clowns in to in­ter­act with younger pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Some care­givers are also bring­ing hu­mour into their own prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Ms Mary Laskin, a nurse case man­ager at Kaiser Per­ma­nente in San Diego, has been work­ing with her chronic-pain pa­tients on­line, teach­ing them laugh­ter ex­er­cises along­side prac­tices to de­velop other pos­i­tive men­tal states, like grat­i­tude and for­give­ness.</p>
    <p>“This pan­demic is like a tiger creep­ing to­wards us, a huge slow­mo­tion stres­sor that makes the ex­pe­ri­ence of pain worse. Hu­mour helps my pa­tients re­lax and re­lease their grip on pain,” she said.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a good sense of hu­mour is an ex­cel­lent way to re­lieve stress and anx­i­ety and bring back a sense of nor­malcy dur­ing th­ese tur­bu­lent times. ’’ DR MICHAEL MILLER, a car­di­ol­o­gist at the Univer­sity of Mary­land School of Medicine</p>
