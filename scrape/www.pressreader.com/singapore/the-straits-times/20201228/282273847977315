    <p>Sin­ga­pore moves into phase three of re­open­ing its econ­omy to­day.</p>
    <p>For life to be­come more nor­mal, and for busi­nesses to get back on their feet, more peo­ple need to be­come im­mune to the virus.</p>
    <p>This can hap­pen only through mass vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 vac­cines be­come pro­gres­sively avail­able, the Min­istry of Health has urged el­i­gi­ble res­i­dents to be vac­ci­nated, but this is vol­un­tary.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme de­pends on who is will­ing to get the shot.</p>
    <p>Wor­ries about safety and ef­fi­cacy will un­der­mine the strat­egy, and one ma­jor is­sue that has been raised is whether vac­cines de­vel­oped in record time can be safe.</p>
    <p>SPEED AND SAFETY</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral rea­sons why the cur­rent slate of Covid-19 vac­cines could be de­vel­oped at break­neck speed while meet­ing the sci­en­tific and reg­u­la­tory rigour nec­es­sary for use on the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>First, the coro­n­avirus is a well­known pathogen to those in the in­fec­tious dis­ease com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Those who re­mem­ber the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) out­break in 2003 may know that that par­tic­u­lar virus is a close cousin of the present Sars-CoV-2 virus, with a high de­gree of ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity, and shar­ing many fea­tures and pro­teins.</p>
    <p>Armed with this knowl­edge, re­searchers were able to rapidly de­velop di­ag­nos­tics and make early at­tempts at an­tivi­rals to com­bat this cur­rent dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, for vac­cines, re­searchers were very quickly able to tar­get pro­teins of in­ter­est, with a rea­son­able amount of as­sur­ance that they were rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the coro­n­avirus uses its unique, crown-shaped spike pro­tein to in­fil­trate a cell and repli­cate. Thus, the spike pro­tein is the fo­cus of most Covid-19 vac­cines as it is the part of the virus that en­ables it to en­ter our cells.</p>
    <p>By Fe­bru­ary, the vac­cine ef­fort was al­ready in full swing right across the globe.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, the scale of part­ner­ship and col­lab­o­ra­tion across all the dif­fer­ent play­ers was at an un­prece­dented level. Col­lab­o­ra­tions that would nor­mally take months or even years to forge were inked in days and weeks.</p>
    <p>A high-pro­file suc­cess story is the part­ner­ship be­tween Pfizer, a large United States-based phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany, and BioNTech, a small Ger­man biotech­nol­ogy firm.</p>
    <p>This com­bined the clin­i­cal devel­op­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing might of a big pharma pow­er­house with the novel mRNA vac­cine dis­cov­ery plat­form of a small and nim­ble biotech.</p>
    <p>An­other ex­am­ple is the col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Sanofi Pas­teur and Glax­oSmithK­line, nor­mally ri­vals in the field of vac­cines, com­bin­ing a pro­tein sub-unit vac­cine from the for­mer with a pan­demic vac­cine ad­ju­vant of the lat­ter. (An ad­ju­vant is an in­gre­di­ent used to cre­ate a stronger im­mune re­sponse.)</p>
    <p>The breath­tak­ing open­ness and will­ing­ness of com­pa­nies to bring to­gether ready-made know-how and tech­nolo­gies have sig­nif­i­cantly ac­cel­er­ated the pace of devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Third, drug and vac­cine devel­op­ment com­prises sev­eral key steps, which are usu­ally per­formed se­quen­tially. It starts with build­ing an</p>
    <p>un­der­stand­ing of the pathogen and its bi­ol­ogy, then the dis­cov­ery of likely drug or vac­cine can­di­dates, the set­ting up of an­i­mal models, early drug ma­te­rial pro­duc­tion, tox­i­c­ity stud­ies, clin­i­cal Phases 1, 2 and 3 (where the drug’s or vac­cine’s safety and ef­fi­cacy are tested on peo­ple), then com­mer­cial-scale man­u­fac­tur­ing and dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­gress­ing from each of th­ese steps to the next re­quires sig­nif­i­cant and ever-in­creas­ing in­vest­ments, with the knowl­edge that fail­ure lurks around the cor­ner.</p>
    <p>Un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances, com­pa­nies are quite leery of mov­ing for­ward un­til a proper study and anal­y­sis of data from the prior steps are com­pleted. Months can pass be­tween the con­clu­sion of one phase to the start of the next, as fu­ture in­vest­ments de­pend on the suc­cess of each stage.</p>
    <p>Given the usual high rate of at­tri­tion and fail­ure of drug and vac­cine devel­op­ment, and ab­sent a press­ing so­ci­etal im­per­a­tive, this pru­dence is usu­ally war­ranted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given the ur­gent need to end the pan­demic, much of the work done on the lead­ing vac­cine can­di­dates has been ex­e­cuted in an over­lap­ping fash­ion, or in par­al­lel.</p>
    <p>Pfizer-BioNTech pro­gressed mul­ti­ple can­di­dates to early lab test­ing to nar­row down those that elicited the best im­mune re­sponse; clin­i­cal stud­ies were planned and sites booked well ahead of the com­ple­tion of an­i­mal tox­i­c­ity stud­ies that fa­cil­i­tated hu­man dos­ing; clin­i­cal Phase 1, 2 and 3 stud­ies were over­lapped to pro­vide seam­less tran­si­tions from ex­ploratory to con­fir­ma­tory tri­als; and large com­mer­cialscale man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­i­ties were set up ahead of time in an­tic­i­pa­tion of suc­cess­ful trial out­comes.</p>
    <p>All this work per­formed “at risk” has en­abled the com­ple­tion of a vac­cine pro­gramme from con­cept in early Fe­bru­ary to de­liv­ery to pa­tients this month.</p>
    <p>Break­neck speed in­deed, but re­plete with all the sci­en­tific, med­i­cal and man­u­fac­tur­ing rigour de­manded of such prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Fourth, to drive the speed of the devel­op­ment ef­fort, gen­er­ous fund­ing, or as­sur­ance of it, had to be forth­com­ing.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that while a fair amount of dis­cov­ery work can oc­cur in aca­demic as well as com­pany labs, when it comes to con­duct­ing large multi­na­tional clin­i­cal tri­als, and mas­sive-scale man­u­fac­tur­ing and dis­tri­bu­tion to the tune of hun­dreds of mil­lions of doses, it is clearly the prov­ince of pri­vate en­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age com­pa­nies to move with speed into ex­pen­sive lat­estage devel­op­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing, some as­sur­ance of cost re­cov­ery is nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>To the credit of many pub­lic agen­cies world­wide, this was recog­nised early, and un­prece­dented amounts of pub­lic fund­ing were com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing the devel­op­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing of vac­cines by se­lected com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, a pri­vate-pub­lic part­ner­ship ini­ti­ated by the US gov­ern­ment, has com­mit­ted in ex­cess of US$7 bil­lion (S$9.3 bil­lion), dis­trib­uted among the likes of John­son & John­son, Moderna, No­vavax and As­traZeneca/Ox­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>This fund­ing has sup­ported late</p>
    <p>stage devel­op­ment and large-scale man­u­fac­tur­ing while as­sur­ing early ac­cess to vac­cines upon ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Other gov­ern­ments have pur­sued bi­lat­eral ad­vance pur­chase agree­ments with individual com­pa­nies, guar­an­tee­ing sup­ply of some vol­umes of vac­cine for the coun­tries in the case of suc­cess­ful devel­op­ment, in ex­change for some fi­nan­cial mit­i­ga­tion for the com­pany in the event of fail­ure.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions and vac­cine al­liance Gavi, through the Co­vax fa­cil­ity meant to en­sure eq­ui­table vac­cine ac­cess world­wide, pro­vide fund­ing to com­pa­nies to mit­i­gate risk for devel­op­ment and as­sure eq­ui­table sup­ply to both low- and high-in­come coun­tries.</p>
    <p>THE ROLE OF REG­U­LA­TORS</p>
    <p>Fifth, the role of reg­u­la­tors as fa­cil­i­ta­tors for rapid guid­ance and re­view is crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>Un­der nor­mal drug and vac­cine devel­op­ment par­a­digms, ma­jor reg­u­la­tory agen­cies tend to have set points of in­ter­ac­tion with com­pa­nies to pro­vide guid­ance on devel­op­ment plans, and will re­ceive full dossiers at the end of devel­op­ment pro­grammes, to be ex­am­ined in their en­tirety.</p>
    <p>Agen­cies like the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) and Euro­pean Medicines Agency may then also con­duct au­dits at clin­i­cal study sites and man­u­fac­tur­ing plants prior to is­su­ing li­cens­ing and mar­ket­ing ap­provals.</p>
    <p>Agen­cies may re­ceive dozens to hun­dreds of new drug ap­pli­ca­tions each year, and such pro­cesses, though not the speed­i­est, al­low for a pre­dictable ca­dence of work and man­age­able through­put for any given num­ber of staff.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19, ma­jor reg­u­la­tory agen­cies around the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity (HSA), have ac­ti­vated ac­cel­er­ated path­ways to speed­ily re­view and ap­prove novel vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The FDA has an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion path­way, and the HSA re­cently in­tro­duced the Pan­demic Spe­cial Ac­cess Route (PSAR) for the in­terim au­tho­ri­sa­tion of crit­i­cal novel vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Th­ese al­low com­pa­nies with ro­bust Phase 3 data to ap­ply for emer­gency use of their prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther ex­pe­dite re­views, reg­u­la­tors have also been ac­cept­ing data on a rolling ba­sis, so that as the fi­nal tri­als come to a con­clu­sion, the re­view of prior in­for­ma­tion may al­ready have been com­pleted.</p>
    <p>Both Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna have been granted emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion by the FDA for their Covid-19 vac­cines, the FDA hav­ing held the two ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee meet­ings a week apart, on open tele­vised plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The HSA has granted in­terim au­tho­ri­sa­tion to the Pfizer-BioNtech vac­cine via the PSAR path­way.</p>
    <p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have pro­vided ro­bust dossiers with data de­scrib­ing ex­cel­lent ef­fi­cacy and safety, for up to about two months of ob­ser­va­tion from the last dose.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines’ ef­fi­cacy of pro­tec­tion from Sars CoV-2 symp­to­matic in­fec­tion of over 94 per cent, across a wide range of ages, in­clud­ing the el­derly, has ex­ceeded even op­ti­mistic ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Th­ese stud­ies were enor­mous, en­rolling in ex­cess of 30,000 pa­tients each, and dos­ing half of those test sub­jects with ac­tive vac­cines.</p>
    <p>A fair pro­por­tion of par­tic­i­pants re­ceiv­ing the vac­cines ex­pe­ri­enced what we could call symp­toms of “re­ac­to­genic­ity”. Th­ese in­clude fever, mus­cle aches and fa­tigue, and arise from an im­mune re­sponse to the vac­ci­na­tion, last­ing a few days.</p>
    <p>There were scat­tered re­ports of Bell’s palsy in the tri­als, and there have been re­ports of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions in a small num­ber of the vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Data on th­ese in­fre­quent events is evolv­ing and vac­ci­na­tion guide­lines will re­quire, for now, close ob­ser­va­tion of vac­cine re­cip­i­ents in the im­me­di­ate pe­riod af­ter re­ceiv­ing the dose.</p>
    <p>Although it was not pre­sented in any de­tail at the ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee meet­ings, the com­pa­nies also pro­vided pre-clin­i­cal and man­u­fac­tur­ing-qual­ity data to the reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS MISS­ING</p>
    <p>The long-term ef­fec­tive­ness and safety of th­ese vac­cines is yet to be fully in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>Clearly, one-year safety data in the hu­man set­ting can come only a year af­ter the last dose; there is just no way to ac­cel­er­ate that process. How­ever, this is not to say that cer­tain in­fer­ences can­not be made about po­ten­tial long-term ef­fects.</p>
    <p>The mech­a­nism of the vac­cine ac­tion, bi­ol­ogy of the dis­ease and sup­port­ing an­i­mal data can all pro­vide clues and an­chors for sci­en­tists to make use­ful pro­jec­tions about po­ten­tial long-term side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Long-term ef­fi­cacy data will be­come fuller with the pas­sage of time, but ini­tial in­di­ca­tions are that the vac­cines are likely to be pro­tec­tive for a good du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other draw­back of ac­cel­er­ated devel­op­ment is that full sta­bil­ity in­for­ma­tion about a vac­cine for­mu­la­tion may not be com­pletely mapped out, or the for­mu­la­tion it­self may not be fully op­ti­mised.</p>
    <p>We hear about the ex­act­ing cold chain re­quire­ments for the Pfiz­erBioNTech vac­cine, which de­mands mi­nus 70 deg C stor­age. This is pos­si­bly be­cause the sta­bil­ity of the mol­e­cule at higher tem­per­a­tures has yet to be fully char­ac­terised, and it has been re­ported that Pfizer is look­ing to de­velop a pow­der form of the vac­cine, which will most likely be sta­ble at higher tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has wrought a dev­as­tat­ing toll on so­ci­ety, both on those af­fected di­rectly by in­fec­tions and in­di­rectly through eco­nomic shut­downs. Vac­cines of­fer a safe way to pro­tect the un­in­fected and also pro­vide a path to re­cov­ery for many sec­tors of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The un­prece­dented speed of Covid-19 vac­cine devel­op­ment is in no way due to any short­cuts taken by the re­searchers, com­pa­nies or reg­u­la­tors. The sci­en­tific meth­ods have been sound, piv­otal clin­i­cal tri­als have been large and well con­ducted, and data pro­vided to date has been full and rig­or­ous.</p>
    <p>With some caveats around the lack of long-term data, the find­ings of the first two vac­cines ap­proved by the FDA in­di­cate highly ef­fec­tive shots with good safety pro­files.</p>
    <p>Enough to pro­vide a glimpse of light at the end of the tun­nel, and for us to roll up our sleeves and take our first steps to­wards it.</p>
