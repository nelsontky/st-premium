    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who have not redeemed their Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers (SRV) have more op­tions now as the list of el­i­gi­ble mer­chants is ex­pand­ing.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) is also ac­tively re­view­ing whether hos­tels with pri­vate fa­cil­i­ties – such as pri­vate en-suite rooms – can be made safe for leisure stays and el­i­gi­ble for the SRV scheme.</p>
    <p>This is in line with STB’s pro­gres­sive re­open­ing of tourism busi­nesses to safe­guard the health and safety of Sin­ga­pore­ans, and to min­imise the risk of new Covid-19 clus­ters, the board told The Straits Times on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the SRV vouch­ers can be used only for ho­tel stays, lo­cal at­trac­tions and tours.</p>
    <p>More mer­chants in these cat­e­gories are ex­pected to come on board, STB said.</p>
    <p>The Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum is one such mer­chant, hav­ing joined this month.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Her­itage Board, which over­sees eight mu­se­ums and her­itage in­sti­tu­tions here, said last Fri­day: “The Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore will also be launch­ing Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers ex­pe­ri­ences. More de­tails will be made avail­able when ready.”</p>
    <p>As at last Wed­nes­day, 206 ho­tels, 146 tour op­er­a­tors and 43 at­trac­tions are on the list of SRV-el­i­gi­ble mer­chants. There are also more than 440 SRV-el­i­gi­ble prod­ucts avail­able for book­ing, as at Jan 1, on the five au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners’ plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Back in Novem­ber last year, The Straits Times re­ported that the vouch­ers could be spent on 178 ho­tels, tours op­er­ated by 79 tour op­er­a­tors as well as 39 at­trac­tions from the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers, which must be redeemed by June 30, have given some at­trac­tions here a big boost.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the Sci­ence Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore saw more vis­i­tors after it be­came an SRV-el­i­gi­ble mer­chant on Dec 1 last year. “We have seen a 20 per cent in­crease in guest num­bers from be­fore the vouch­ers were in­tro­duced. More than 30 per cent of the over­all tick­ets sold are SRV re­demp­tions,” a Sci­ence Cen­tre spokesman said.</p>
    <p>For now, the vouch­ers can­not be used at hos­tels, which were badly hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic. “As back­pack­ers’ hos­tels are close-liv­ing quar­ters where non-re­lated in­di­vid­u­als are likely to come into close con­tact, of­ten in en­closed spa­ces, and for pro­longed pe­ri­ods of time, MTI (Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try) has not al­lowed hos­tels to ac­cept book­ings by lo­cals for leisure pur­poses,” said STB.</p>
    <p>For Pod Bou­tique Cap­sule Ho­tel gen­eral man­ager Steven Lee, the past year has been a dif­fi­cult one for the hos­tel. “Phase three is here and they’ve started to re­lax some of the rules. But I don’t know how long it’ll take for this to ap­ply to us,” he said.</p>
