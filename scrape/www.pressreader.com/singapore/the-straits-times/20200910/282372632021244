    <p>The sec­ond week­end’s glamour game may have the sub­plot of the sea­son’s theme. Chelsea against Liver­pool is change against con­ti­nu­ity, spenders ver­sus savers.</p>
    <p>Chelsea have turned the clock back to the start of the Ro­man Abramovich era, when they blew ev­ery­one else out of the wa­ter with their fi­nan­cial power.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool have al­most of­fered an ac­tion re­play of last sum­mer. Then their only se­nior sign­ing was a re­serve goal­keeper. Now they have ac­quired only a back-up left­back.</p>
    <p>Sta­bil­ity worked fa­mously well for Jur­gen Klopp last sea­son. Now it has been rather en­forced by cir­cum­stances. He wanted Timo Werner, but Liver­pool could not af­ford him and Chelsea could.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus-re­lated drop in rev­enues has split foot­ball into two tribes.</p>
    <p>Those with bil­lion­aire back­ers or money in the bank are bet­ter placed to spend in a de­pleted mar­ket. The rest face a juggling act and some of those who have spent so far, like Arse­nal, now need to sell.</p>
    <p>The race for the top four went down to the wire last sea­son, but now its par­tic­i­pants have been sep­a­rated by sign­ings: Chelsea have four ma­jor ones al­ready and Manch­ester United have used their vast com­mer­cial rev­enues to ac­quire the cov­eted Dutch­man Donny van de Beek.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Le­ices­ter lost Ben Chilwell to Chelsea and have a trans­fer-mar­ket profit.</p>
    <p>The su­per-rich are best placed to ride out a storm. They have boosted the di­vi­sion’s over­all out­lay.</p>
    <p>Premier League clubs spent around £1.4 bil­lion (S$2.48 bil­lion) last sum­mer. So far, this sum­mer’s ex­pen­di­ture amounts to about £760 mil­lion, though that is in­flated by a few deals struck be­fore the ef­fects of coro­n­avirus were felt. Chelsea are re­spon­si­ble for al­most 30 per cent of that and Kai Havertz at an ini­tial £72 mil­lion rep­re­sents the sum­mer’s big­gest deal.</p>
    <p>But there is not a sim­ple equa­tion be­tween ex­pen­di­ture and ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool’s re­cruit­ment was ter­rific but then they sus­tained chem­istry and con­sis­tency over two years since their last ma­jor buys.</p>
    <p>City’s ar­rivals so far, Nathan Ake and Fer­ran Tor­res, might both be­gin on the bench. Chelsea and United fin­ished 33 points back last sea­son and sign­ings will have to be su­perla­tive to make up that ground. Some of the other im­prove­ments will have to be internal.</p>
    <p>Es­pe­cially as trans­fers are no guar­an­tee of suc­cess, let alone im­me­di­ately when they have not had a proper pre-sea­son. Chelsea spent over £200 mil­lion in 2017-18, but Al­varo Mo­rata, Danny Drinkwa­ter and Tiemoue Bakayoko were all ex­pen­sive dis­ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>Now there is a long-term ap­proach to their busi­ness. Apart from vet­eran de­fender Thi­ago Silva, 35, they have set them­selves up for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>This sea­son is de­signed to be part of an up­ward curve to take them back to the sum­mit.</p>
    <p>But if the con­cern for Liver­pool is that those who stand still even­tu­ally go back­wards, it is no­table how few re­cent cham­pi­ons have had a new sign­ing make a de­ci­sive im­pact.</p>
    <p>Sea­sons can be shaped by con­ti­nu­ity. Per­haps it is why none of the 20 clubs changed man­agers in the sum­mer, but the ques­tion for Liver­pool is if too much sta­bil­ity can back­fire and for Chelsea if a rev­o­lu­tion takes time to have an im­pact.</p>
