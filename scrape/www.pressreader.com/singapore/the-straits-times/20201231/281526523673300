    <p>More than 1,400 house­holds will be able to mon­i­tor elec­tric­ity us­age across ap­pli­ances in smart-en­abled flats in Pung­gol Northshore. The 1,192 home own­ers who had col­lected the keys to their flats as at Dec 14 were the first in Sin­ga­pore to live in such smart-en­abled Hous­ing Board (HDB) flats, HDB said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>More than 1,400 house­holds will be able to mon­i­tor elec­tric­ity us­age across ap­pli­ances in smart-en­abled flats in Pung­gol Northshore.</p>
    <p>As at Dec 14, 1,192 home own­ers who have col­lected the keys to their flats – about 85 per cent of the to­tal – are the first in Sin­ga­pore to live in such smart-en­abled Hous­ing Board flats, the HDB said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 1,402 units in to­tal are in 12 res­i­den­tial blocks spread across two Build-To-Or­der (BTO) projects, Northshore Res­i­dences I and II. These flats are equipped with smart power sock­ets and hightech dis­tri­bu­tion boards, which en­able oc­cu­pants to trans­form them into smart homes.</p>
    <p>The smart dis­tri­bu­tion board al­lows users to mon­i­tor their en­ergy con­sump­tion, which, in turn, en­ables them to save elec­tric­ity and re­duce their util­ity bills, said HDB.</p>
    <p>The built-in fea­tures al­low res­i­dents to eas­ily adopt other smart home solutions and ap­pli­ca­tions de­vel­oped by com­mer­cial com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the flats, smart fea­tures have been in­cor­po­rated in Pung­gol Northshore, one of seven wa­ter­front hous­ing dis­tricts in Pung­gol.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents liv­ing in Northshore Res­i­dences I and II will be the first to use a new-gen­er­a­tion park­ing sys­tem, the lat­est ad­di­tion to the suite of smart fea­tures in the district.</p>
    <p>Park­ing@HDB is a smart sys­tem with five new fea­tures, of which four will be tri­alled at one carpark with 1,000 park­ing spa­ces from Mon­day. There will be no gantry bar­ri­ers at the carpark en­trance and exit as ve­hi­cle num­ber plates are reg­is­tered by cam­eras.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors park­ing there will have the op­tion of pay­ing the charges via credit or debit card through the Park­ing@HDB app. The cor­rect fee will be au­to­mat­i­cally de­ducted when they exit the carpark, with­out mo­torists hav­ing to man­u­ally ac­ti­vate the app or use a CashCard in the in-ve­hi­cle unit.</p>
    <p>They will re­ceive in-app no­ti­fi­ca­tions in real time at the start and end of their park­ing ses­sions that will also in­form them of their in­curred charges. They will even be no­ti­fied if they are parked in an unau­tho­rised space.</p>
    <p>A new over­head colour-coded</p>
    <p>LED light in­di­ca­tor sys­tem will sig­nal space avail­abil­ity. Green in­di­cates avail­abil­ity for short-term park­ing, while am­ber means reser­va­tion for sea­son park­ing. The light in­di­ca­tor will be switched off for oc­cu­pied spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Us­ing col­lected data on carpark us­age, the smart park­ing sys­tem will al­lo­cate spa­ces be­tween sea­son park­ing and short-term park­ing to meet vary­ing de­mands of res­i­dents and vis­i­tors on a real-time ba­sis. This fea­ture will be rolled out at a later date.</p>
    <p>HDB said it will ex­tend the trial to other carparks in the Northshore district as more BTO projects are com­pleted.</p>
    <p>Within the district, sen­sors have been de­ployed to an­a­lyse the per­for­mance of key es­tate ser­vices such as light­ing, wa­ter pumps, lifts and waste col­lec­tion, for pre­dic­tive main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>Sen­sor-con­trolled smart light­ing in com­mon ar­eas which can be dimmed au­to­mat­i­cally, and a smart ir­ri­ga­tion sys­tem that uses mois­ture sen­sors are in place.</p>
    <p>HDB chief ex­ec­u­tive Cheong Koon Hean said the com­ple­tion of the first smart precincts in Pung­gol Northshore is a “ma­jor mile­stone” in HDB’s smart j our­ney, which started in 2014.</p>
    <p>Tal­ent man­ager Alvin Lim, 36, who moved into his five-room flat in Northshore Res­i­dences I with his wife and two-year-old daugh­ter ear­lier this month, said he in­tends to con­nect his smart TV and fridge to the built-in fea­tures for a start.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, who drives reg­u­larly, said the bar­rier-free carpark makes park­ing more ef­fi­cient, sav­ing him a few min­utes ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>TRANS­FORM­ING PUBLIC HOUS­ING</p>
    <p>The de­liv­ery of these smart homes also caps off year 2020, where HDB marks 60 years of trans­form­ing Sin­ga­pore’s public hous­ing land­scape, with sig­nif­i­cant shifts to­wards well-de­signed, smart, sus­tain­able and com­mu­ni­ty­cen­tric towns in the last 10 years.</p>
