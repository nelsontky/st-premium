    <p>More debt-stricken in­di­vid­u­als strug­gled to pay off their loans at the start of the pan­demic and dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, said debt man­age­ment com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>In April, when the cir­cuit breaker kicked in, non­profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Credit Coun­selling Sin­ga­pore (CCS) said it saw about 800 ex­ist­ing clients un­der its debt man­age­ment pro­gramme re­quest­ing fur­ther as­sis­tance as they could not com­mit to their monthly re­pay­ment ar­range­ments with banks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of re­quests fell to about 170 in June, once phase one started, but it was still twice as high com­pared with or­di­nary times, said CCS gen­eral man­ager Tan Huey Min.</p>
    <p>Last year, the or­gan­i­sa­tion re­ceived about 90 such re­quests ev­ery month, she said.</p>
    <p>“To help our clients affected by the pan­demic, we ap­proached banks and pro­posed spe­cial re­pay­ment ar­range­ments to lower their monthly in­stal­ments dur­ing this pe­riod,” added Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>Debt man­age­ment and so­lu­tion com­pany EDUdebt saw a 300 per cent in­crease in its num­ber of clients be­tween Jan­uary and March this year, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, said the com­pany’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Ab­bas Hamzah.</p>
    <p>“The main rea­son for the in­crease is due to the re­ces­sion, loss of em­ploy­ment, over-lev­er­ag­ing on loan ca­pa­bil­i­ties and the lack of ad­e­quate sav­ings to pre­pare for any un­fore­seen cir­cum­stances,” added Mr Hamzah.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said debtors were hard­est hit dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker when many busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties, es­pe­cially in the ser­vice sec­tor, came to a stand­still.</p>
    <p>This affected those work­ing in the food sec­tor, clubs and shop­ping cen­tres, and also Grab driv­ers, she said.</p>
    <p>In March, bank­ruptcy ap­pli­ca­tions reached 462, the high­est in more than 15 years, ex­ceed­ing those dur­ing the fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2008 and 2009, which were be­tween 200 and 300.</p>
