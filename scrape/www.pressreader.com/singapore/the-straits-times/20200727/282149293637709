    <p>Grow­ing up in a sin­gle-par­ent home can be tough on a child but fresh grad­u­ate Norul­lay­a­ley Mohd Ik­bal said she was never hard done, with ex­tended fam­ily, friends and neigh­bours all lend­ing a hand.</p>
    <p>Her mother, a ther­a­pist, al­ways made time for her and her younger sis­ter and she even found her­self in a po­si­tion to help oth­ers when she tu­tored un­der­priv­i­leged kids as a vol­un­teer with Touch Young Ar­rows in se­condary school.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence sparked a pas­sion to help those in need and led Ms Norul­lay­a­ley to study psy­chol­ogy at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) to bet­ter un­der­stand the peo­ple she would help.</p>
    <p>She re­called: “My fam­ily wanted me to pur­sue busi­ness or law be­cause they thought th­ese were fields with more fi­nan­cially secure jobs. For me, I wanted to do some­thing ful­fill­ing.”</p>
    <p>That drive was cel­e­brated last Fri­day when Ms Norul­lay­a­ley, 23, grad­u­ated from SMU with a Bach­e­lor of So­cial Sciences, ma­jor­ing in psy­chol­ogy and public pol­icy and public man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>She said she has learnt a lot from her un­der­grad­u­ate stud­ies, par­tic­u­larly as one of her projects fo­cused on sin­gle par­ents.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence ex­posed her to those who had fallen through the cracks. “We had in-depth con­ver­sa­tions with low-in­come sin­gle par­ents,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese in­ter­views... took us deeper into the lives of sin­gle par­ents fac­ing hard­ships.”</p>
    <p>Ms Norul­lay­a­ley plans to work in health­care with hopes of mak­ing a dif­fer­ence by health pol­icy.</p>
    <p>On week­ends, she con­tin­ues to vol­un­teer, tu­tor­ing Pri­mary 6 pupils over Zoom.</p>
    <p>Ms Norul­lay­a­ley paid trib­ute to her mother even as she cel­e­brates be­ing the first on her fa­ther’s side to grad­u­ate from univer­sity. Her par­ents are sep­a­rated, and she also has five half-sib­lings.</p>
    <p>She de­scribed her mother, Madam Sarimah So­eradi, 55, as the “warm­est, smartest, and most lov­ing per­son” she knows, and said she of­ten bounced ideas off her when stuck over school­work.</p>
    <p>“She’s very much in­volved and very sup­port­ive of me go­ing on my own path.</p>
    <p>“She’s been there ev­ery step of the way,” she added. im­prov­ing public</p>
