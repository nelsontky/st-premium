    <p>TOUGH AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>Con­fronting China on its un­fair trade prac­tices will be a “key pri­or­ity” in his ad­min­is­tra­tion, United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den said on Fri­day as he in­tro­duced vet­eran trade lawyer Kather­ine Tai as his choice for the na­tion’s top trade en­voy and ad­viser.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old Ms Tai, who is the chief trade coun­sel on the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives’ Ways and Means Com­mit­tee, worked for the Of­fice of the US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive (USTR) from 2007 to 2014.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this time, she rose to be­come the chief trade en­forcer against un­fair trade prac­tices by China from 2011 to 2014, rop­ing in trade part­ners to suc­cess­fully bring cases against China in the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO).</p>
    <p>“She un­der­stands that we need to be more strate­gic in how we trade – in a way that makes us all stronger and leaves no one be­hind,” said Mr Bi­den, adding that Ms Tai will work closely with his eco­nomic, na­tional se­cu­rity and for­eign pol­icy teams.</p>
    <p>If con­firmed by the Se­nate, Ms Tai will be the first Asian Amer­i­can in the USTR post.</p>
    <p>Be­yond her solid cre­den­tials and so­phis­ti­cated un­der­stand­ing of trade is­sues, Ms Tai also “em­bod­ies a pow­er­ful im­mi­grant story of Amer­ica”, said Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents were born in main­land China and grew up in Tai­wan. They moved to the US as grad­u­ate stu­dents in the sciences in the 1960s, fol­low­ing im­mi­gra­tion re­forms that en­abled a wave of Asian mi­grants go­ing to the US.</p>
    <p>Ms Tai’s fa­ther be­came a re­searcher at the Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Mary­land, help­ing the US army ad­vance treat­ments for Amer­i­can troops who fought in the Viet­nam War, said Ms Tai on Fri­day af­ter be­ing in­tro­duced by Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>She added that her mother still works at the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health, the US gov­ern­ment’s med­i­cal re­search cen­tre, de­vel­op­ing treat­ments for opi­oid ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents be­came nat­u­ralised Amer­i­can cit­i­zens in 1979, five years af­ter Ms Tai was born in Con­necti­cut. She was “the very first Amer­i­can in our fam­ily”, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tai, a Yale and Har­vard grad­u­ate, speaks flu­ent Man­darin and taught English for two years at Zhong­shan Univer­sity in Guangzhou, China, i n the l ate 1990s.</p>
    <p>Trade watch­ers said that Ms Tai will have the stom­ach and the ex­per­tise to con­front China. But her past record sug­gests she may do so in a way dif­fer­ent from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion: un­der the um­brella of mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions and to­gether with part­ners.</p>
    <p>“Tai will be en­tirely com­fort­able in ag­gres­sively con­fronting China when needed,” Mr Stephen Ol­son, a re­search fel­low at the Hong Kong-based Hin­rich Foun­da­tion and a for­mer US trade ne­go­tia­tor, wrote in an on­line com­men­tary.</p>
    <p>He ex­pected the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s tar­iffs on Chi­nese goods to re­main in place at least ini­tially, as Ms Tai di­rects the Of­fice of the USTR to con­duct a thor­ough re­view of the phase one agree­ment that marked some­thing of a cease­fire to the US-China trade war.</p>
    <p>“She has also ex­pressed com­fort with sub­si­dies and in­cen­tives to re­duce US over-re­liance on Chi­nese im­ports,” added Mr Ol­son.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing her time in the Of­fice of the USTR, the US brought a num­ber of cases against China in the WTO.</p>
    <p>One no­table vic­tory in­volved the US chal­leng­ing China’s quo­tas on ex­ports of rare earth min­er­als, which are crit­i­cal to mak­ing tech gad­gets such as iPhones and are sup­plied pri­mar­ily by China.</p>
    <p>Ms Tai was cred­ited with bring­ing a num­ber of coun­tries on board to join the US in the rare-earths case against China, in­clud­ing Canada and Ja­pan, as well as the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>China dropped the quo­tas in 2015, fol­low­ing the WTO’s rul­ing against it in 2014.</p>
    <p>As the Democrats’ trade lawyer, she was in­stru­men­tal in ne­go­ti­at­ing with the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to work tougher labour and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tions into the US-Mex­ico-Canada Agree­ment, which was passed with strong bi­par­ti­san sup­port last year.</p>
    <p>This was a demon­stra­tion of her abil­ity to find com­mon ground be­tween mod­er­ates and pro­gres­sives, wrote Mr Ol­son, who added that her tal­ent in threading the nee­dle on dif­fi­cult com­pro­mises would take on greater im­por­tance as the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion nav­i­gates tricky do­mes­tic pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“She not only brings trade ex­per­tise to the job, but an abil­ity to prob­lem-solve with all sides of the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum. Those skills will be needed as we nav­i­gate a postTrump trade pol­icy,” wrote for­mer act­ing deputy USTR Wendy Cut­ler on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Bi­den: “She’s earned praise from law­mak­ers of both par­ties and from both labour and busi­ness as well. Now that’s a feat.”</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing Ms Tai, he added: “I’ve got more calls com­pli­ment­ing me on your ap­point­ment than you can imag­ine.”</p>
    <p>Tai will be en­tirely com­fort­able in ag­gres­sively con­fronting China when needed.</p>
