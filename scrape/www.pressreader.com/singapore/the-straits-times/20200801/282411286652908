    <p>• Frank Lam­pard be­lieves Chelsea should be aim­ing to fight for league ti­tles ev­ery year, but win­ning the FA Cup to­day could be a build­ing block to­wards a ti­tle chal­lenge next sea­son.</p>
    <p>In his first sea­son in charge, the club great has guided the Blues into the Cham­pi­ons League next sea­son de­spite the loss of Eden Hazard to Real Madrid and a one-win­dow trans­fer ban to con­tend with.</p>
    <p>Chelsea are al­ready mak­ing up for lost time in the trans­fer mar­ket with big-money sign­ings Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech in place.</p>
    <p>With Lam­pard’s men fac­ing an up­hill task i n the Cham­pi­ons League – they trail Bun­desliga cham­pi­ons Bay­ern Mu­nich 3-0 ahead of the sec­ond leg of their last-16 tie next Satur­day – the Cup ap­pears to be their only chance of sil­ver­ware this sea­son.</p>
    <p>But the 42-year-old does not want his side to think a tro­phy is the be-all and end-all – rather, they should be com­pet­ing on all fronts.</p>
    <p>At his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Lam­pard, who is gun­ning for his first man­age­rial hon­our, said: “It’s a nice boost but it will only mean any­thing go­ing for­ward if we take it in our pocket, move for­ward and im­prove as a club and on the train­ing pitch.</p>
    <p>“In the last few years, we haven’t been able to fight for that league ti­tle so it doesn’t mean all of sud­den we are back, but it will be a nice, small step when you con­sider where we want to get to.”</p>
    <p>He con­firmed that N’Golo Kante had re­cov­ered from a ham­string in­jury that kept him out of their last six games, while Wil­lian is fit again for what could be his fi­nal game for the club. The Brazil for­ward’s con­tract ex­pires at the end of the sea­son, but Lam­pard claimed he would have no qualms nam­ing him in his line-up at Wem­b­ley de­spite ru­mours that Ar­se­nal might be his next des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>On the 31-year-old, he said: “I’ve known Wil­lian for many years now, as a player and now as his coach. So I would ex­pect noth­ing less than he’s shown al­ready, and that’s Wil­lian for you.”</p>
    <p>While Lam­pard is hope­ful vic­tory can spur his team to new heights, Ar­se­nal, who can play in the Europa League next term only if they win the Cup, are in the early stages of re­build­ing un­der Mikel Arteta.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics feel his side will be the un­der­dogs, point­ing out that they froze in last year’s Europa League fi­nal, crum­bling 4-1 to to­day’s op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Spa­niard yes­ter­day in­sisted that heavy loss would have no bear­ing at Wem­b­ley, say­ing: “A year in foot­ball is a dif­fer­ent life... so there is not many things to take from that (de­feat).”</p>
    <p>A loss to­day will likely has­ten an exit for top scorer Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang, who only has one year left on his deal, al­though</p>
    <p>Arteta told re­porters that he “did not fear” this could be the striker’s fi­nal ap­pear­ance for the club.</p>
    <p>Due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, there will be no pre­sen­ta­tion party, nor will the win­ning side as­cend the steps to the Royal Box as the tro­phy will in­stead be awarded on the pitch.</p>
