    <p>• Aus­tralia un­veiled a draft law yes­ter­day to force Google and Face­book to pay news me­dia for their con­tent or face huge fines in one of the most ag­gres­sive moves by any gov­ern­ment to curb the power of the United States dig­i­tal gi­ants.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia will be­come the first coun­try to re­quire Face­book and Google to pay for news con­tent pro­vided by me­dia com­pa­nies un­der a roy­alty-style sys­tem that will be­come law this year, Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg said.</p>
    <p>“It’s about a fair go for Aus­tralian news me­dia busi­nesses. It’s about en­sur­ing that we have in­creased com­pe­ti­tion, in­creased con­sumer pro­tec­tion and a sus­tain­able me­dia land­scape,” Mr Fry­den­berg told re­porters in Mel­bou rne.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing less than the fu­ture of the Aus­tralian me­dia land­scape is at stake.”</p>
    <p>For ev­ery A$100 (S$98.50) spent on on­line advertisin­g in Aus­tralia, ex­clud­ing clas­si­fieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Face­book, ac­cord­ing to Mr Fry­den­berg.</p>
    <p>The “manda­tory code of con­duct” to gov­ern re­la­tions be­tween the strug­gling news in­dus­try and the tech­nol­ogy firms was in­tro­duced af­ter 18 months of ne­go­ti­a­tions failed to bring the two sides to­gether.</p>
    <p>Vi­o­la­tions of the code will draw penal­ties of up to A$10 mil­lion per breach, or 10 per cent of either com­pany’s lo­cal turnover.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to pay­ment for con­tent, the code cov­ers is­sues like ac­cess to user data and trans­parency around the al­go­rithms used to rank con­tent in the plat­forms’ news feeds and search re­sults.</p>
    <p>Un­der the code, drawn up by an­titrust watch­dog the Aus­tralian Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion, tech com­pa­nies will be re­quired to ne­go­ti­ate with news firms “in good faith” over pay­ments for use of their con­tent.</p>
    <p>If agree­ment can­not be reached within three months, the is­sue will go to bind­ing ar­bi­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­like other coun­tries’ so-far un­suc­cess­ful ef­forts to force the plat­forms to pay for news, the Aus­tralian ini­tia­tive uses com­pe­ti­tion law and not copy­right reg­u­la­tions to chal­lenge what Aus­tralia calls an “acute bar­gain­ing power im­bal­ance” be­tween me­dia and the Amer­i­can gi­ants.</p>
    <p>Mr Fry­den­berg said leg­is­la­tion im­ple­ment­ing the code would be in­tro­duced to Par­lia­ment in the com­ing weeks af­ter a fi­nal round of con­sul­ta­tions – and would in­clude “sub­stan­tial penal­ties” that could cost the tech com­pa­nies hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>While the code could even­tu­ally ap­ply to any dig­i­tal plat­form, Mr Fry­den­berg said it would ini­tially fo­cus on Face­book and Google, two of the world’s rich­est and most pow­er­ful com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Google re­sponded quickly, say­ing it was “deeply dis­ap­pointed” with the pro­posal.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment’s heavy­handed in­ter­ven­tion threat­ens to im­pede Aus­tralia’s dig­i­tal econ­omy and im­pacts the ser­vices we can de­liver to Aus­tralians,” said Mr Mel Silva, Google’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Aus­tralia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Face­book is­sued a terse one-line re­sponse that hinted it could re­con­sider its ac­tiv­i­ties in Aus­tralia if the pro­pos­als were im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Mr Will Eas­ton, Face­book’s lo­cal man­ager, said: “We are re­view­ing the gov­ern­ment’s pro­posal to un­der­stand the im­pact it will have on the in­dus­try, our ser­vices and our in­vest­ment in the news ecosys­tem in Aus­tralia.”</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive has been closely watched around the globe as news me­dia world­wide have suf­fered in an in­creas­ingly dig­i­tal econ­omy, where advertisin­g rev­enue is over­whelm­ingly cap­tured by Face­book, Google and other big tech firms.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis has been ex­ac­er­bated by the eco­nomic col­lapse caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with dozens of Aus­tralian news­pa­pers clos­ing and hun­dreds of jour­nal­ists sacked in re­cent months.</p>
