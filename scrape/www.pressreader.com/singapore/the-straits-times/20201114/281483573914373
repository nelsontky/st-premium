    <p>Res­i­dents in the east of Sin­ga­pore will be served by a new in­te­grated hospi­tal lo­cated next to Be­dok North MRT sta­tion when the fa­cil­ity opens around 2030.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day an­nounced that the hospi­tal will be built on a plot of land bounded by Be­dok Reservoir Road and Be­dok North Road.</p>
    <p>The new hospi­tal is meant to ease the load on Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal (CGH), and com­ple­ment other ini­tia­tives to pro­vide good med­i­cal care for the coun­try’s grow­ing sil­ver pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Plans for the hospi­tal were first an­nounced in March in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said yes­ter­day that it will in­te­grate the func­tions of a gen­eral hospi­tal and a com­mu­nity hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The gen­eral hospi­tal will pro­vide emer­gency ser­vices as well as in­pa­tient and spe­cial­ist out­pa­tient ser­vices, while the com­mu­nity hospi­tal will of­fer in­ter­me­di­ate ser­vices such as re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and sub­a­cute care to sup­port pa­tients dis­charged from the gen­eral hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other in­sti­tu­tions in Sin­ga­pore cur­rently co-lo­cate gen­eral and com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals next to each other, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal and Ou­tram Com­mu­nity Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>SingHealth will op­er­ate the new hospi­tal in Be­dok, which will help to bet­ter serve the health­care needs of the com­mu­nity in the east of Sin­ga­pore, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>As CGH is now the only hospi­tal in the east, the new in­te­grated hospi­tal will help add to the health­care ca­pac­ity there, he added.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 10 pub­lic acute hos­pi­tals and nine com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This will go up to 12 pub­lic acute and 12 com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals across the is­land by 2030, when the new hospi­tal and the up­com­ing Wood­lands Health Cam­pus and in­te­grated care hub in Novena are ready.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) said it in­tends to call tenders over the com­ing weeks to ap­point project con­sul­tants to plan and de­sign the in­te­grated hospi­tal in Be­dok North.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents in the area wel­comed news of the hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Madam Tay Lee Keng, 61, said the fa­cil­ity can help the many se­niors liv­ing in Be­dok who may have to make emer­gency vis­its. “Not ev­ery­one has chil­dren to take them to the hospi­tal, so if it’s nearer to home, it’s eas­ier,” added the as­sis­tant teacher at a kinder­garten.</p>
    <p>Mr Lionel Gan, 53, who works in telco sales and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment, hopes the cam­pus can weave as­pects of the Be­dok neigh­bour­hood into its de­sign: “If we could in­cor­po­rate the East Coast feel of open­ness, leafi­ness (and) airi­ness... that might in ac­tual fact has­ten the re­cov­ery process for pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>Teacher He­len Yeo, 50, sug­gested pro­vid­ing shut­tle buses for peo­ple who live in other ar­eas of Be­dok, as the hospi­tal may not be as ac­ces­si­ble to them.</p>
    <p>She also hopes that it will pro­vide ser­vices such as men­tal health care and care­giver sup­port.</p>
    <p>MOH said it will work with SingHealth to en­gage the com­mu­nity in the area and co-create ideas on how the new hospi­tal can bet­ter meet their needs.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Josephine Gan, 65, said: “My hus­band and I have no chil­dren, so we’ll need some­one to care for us if we have de­men­tia, or when we can’t walk. So I think this is very good for us.”</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals here must be de­signed with flex­i­bil­ity in mind so they can adapt to chang­ing health­care needs in fu­ture, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing to re­porters dur­ing a tour of Ou­tram Com­mu­nity Hospi­tal (OCH), where he an­nounced that a new in­te­grated hospi­tal would be opened next to Be­dok North MRT sta­tion around 2030.</p>
    <p>Asked whether the in­te­grated model re­flects how all hos­pi­tals here will look in the fu­ture, Mr Gan said such a model – which com­bines the func­tions of a gen­eral hospi­tal and com­mu­nity hospi­tal – is very im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“We see many of the pa­tients, when they are dis­charged, es­pe­cially the older pa­tients, re­quire an ex­tended pe­riod of re­hab,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of do­ing it within the hospi­tal, which is very, very costly – and we also need to fo­cus acute hos­pi­tals’ ca­pac­i­ties on those with acute needs – this is bet­ter dealt with in a com­mu­nity hospi­tal.”</p>
    <p>He also em­pha­sised that com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals play a key role in help­ing pa­tients re­cover, and that the in­te­grated model al­lows pa­tients to be trans­ferred be­tween both types of hos­pi­tals smoothly.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Gan added: “The model is evolv­ing all the time be­cause our health­care needs are also evolv­ing all the time.”</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the new in­te­grated hospi­tal will take about 10 years from its de­sign to be com­pleted, and will likely last for an­other 40 years or so, Mr Gan said: “By the time you fin­ish, it can­not be based on the needs that you have to­day.”</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral other in­sti­tu­tions across the is­land that have gen­eral and com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals lo­cated next to each other.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal and Ren Ci Hospi­tal, Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal and Jurong Com­mu­nity Hospi­tal, and Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal (SGH) and OCH.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said t hat chang­ing de­mo­graph­ics and dis­ease pat­terns will re­quire a chang­ing model of care. So it is im­por­tant that hos­pi­tals are flex­i­ble and can ad­just to th­ese new care mod­els where nec­es­sary, he added.</p>
    <p>He said many new hos­pi­tals are al­ready built with this flex­i­bil­ity in mind.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, dur­ing the pan­demic, OCH handed some of its wards to SGH to be run as acute wards, al­low­ing SGH to free up ca­pac­ity to care for Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“That has been the key con­sid­er­a­tion. You need that flex­i­bil­ity to al­low us to adapt to changes in health­care needs,” Mr Gan said.</p>
