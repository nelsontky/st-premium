    <p>A re­cent vi­ral video showed a walk­way in Pung­gol that stopped short of a bus stop due to a rail­ing block­ing the way. Five days later, the is­sue was fixed (right). Ex­perts and MPs said such in­fras­truc­tural kinks can of­ten stem from mul­ti­ple gov­ern­ment agen­cies hav­ing to man­age dif­fer­ent ju­ris­dic­tions, pri­or­i­ties and bud­gets.</p>
    <p>The multi-storey carpark at the Water­way Sun­dew es­tate in Pung­gol boasts what res­i­dent Kather­ine calls an “open-top con­cept” – a breezy ceil­ing lo­cated, cu­ri­ously, on the first floor.</p>
    <p>“So on rainy days, you will be to­tally drenched walk­ing to the carpark,” said the mother of two, who wanted to be known only by her first name, of the carpark at Block 661 Edgedale Plains.</p>
    <p>“It’s bad when I have my kid to hold, a baby to carry and no ex­tra hand for an um­brella.”</p>
    <p>Kather­ine, 35, said res­i­dents have been giv­ing feed­back through both their MP, Dr Janil Puthuc­heary, and the Gov­ern­ment’s OneSer­vice app for mu­nic­i­pal is­sues.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing has been done,” she said. “With some is­sues, we can give and take but some re­ally need to be ad­dressed.”</p>
    <p>One of th­ese com­plaints was re­cently dealt with – and per­haps quicker than res­i­dents could have imag­ined, af­ter what some de­scribed as at least two years of con­ster­na­tion and com­plaints.</p>
    <p>Early this month, a video was posted on so­cial me­dia high­light­ing a cov­ered walk­way near Block 661A i n the same es­tate that stopped short of a bus stop due to a rail­ing block­ing the way. Five days later, the is­sue was fixed.</p>
    <p>The town coun­cil for the area, Pasir Ris-Pung­gol, told The Straits Times that it was not in­volved in de­sign­ing, build­ing or rec­ti­fy­ing the walk­way.</p>
    <p>The Hous­ing Board and Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) con­firmed that they had worked to­gether on the project, and said: “Con­struc­tion works for the linkway ex­ten­sion were de­layed due to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“With con­struc­tion works re­sum­ing, we man­aged to now build a stair­case to al­low di­rect ac­cess from the linkway to the rear of the bus stop.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts and MPs said such in­fras­truc­tural kinks also of­ten stem from mul­ti­ple gov­ern­ment agen­cies hav­ing to man­age dif­fer­ent ju­ris­dic­tions, pri­or­i­ties and bud­gets.</p>
    <p>They told ST that while co­or­di­na­tion be­tween th­ese var­i­ous bod­ies could be im­proved, it was more cru­cial to adopt a proac­tive ap­proach to such mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar sug­ges­tions were raised in fo­rum let­ters that were sent to</p>
    <p>ST af­ter the video of the Pung­gol walk­way went vi­ral on­line.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic in­ter­est and de­bate over such in­ci­dents sur­face from time to time.</p>
    <p>In 2017, a cov­ered walk­way that stopped 10m short of the en­trance to Khatib MRT sta­tion was brought to Par­lia­ment’s at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>The rea­son was that agen­cies in­volved could not agree on how to deal with the af­fected area be­ing des­ig­nated as an emer­gency fire es­cape route.</p>
    <p>It has been pointed out that the Mu­nic­i­pal Ser­vices Of­fice (MSO), which falls un­der the Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­istry, ex­ists pre­cisely to iron out such mul­ti­a­gency glitches.</p>
    <p>But an MSO spokesman told ST that while the of­fice works with agen­cies and town coun­cils to co­or­di­nate mu­nic­i­pal is­sues, it does not over­see the plan­ning and con­struc­tion of pub­lic in­fra­struc­ture like cov­ered linkways.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers noted that such is­sues are rel­a­tively rare, and have be­come less preva­lent over time.</p>
    <p>They at­tribute Sin­ga­pore’s over­all suc­cess in build­ing cov­ered walk­ways is­land­wide to im­proved align­ment be­tween agen­cies.</p>
    <p>LTA builds and main­tains cov­ered walk­ways con­nect­ing to trans­port nodes. Those link­ing to res­i­den­tial blocks are built by HDB and main­tained by town coun­cils.</p>
    <p>En­gi­neer­ing con­sul­tant Gopinath Menon said is­sues arise when there are plots of “short in­ter­ven­ing land” owned by gov­ern­ment agen­cies such as PUB or the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity, or even pri­vately owned land.</p>
    <p>“It will take time to ne­go­ti­ate for the rights to build across, source the funds and de­cide who will con­struct it. The en­su­ing de­lay is of­ten seen as poor plan­ning,” he added.</p>
    <p>In a fo­rum let­ter pub­lished in ST on Dec 11, a res­i­dent high­lighted how a cov­ered walk­way to Chua Chu Kang Com­mu­nity Club (CC) had a de­sign that did “not make sense” – in this case, due to sports fa­cil­i­ties in­ter­fer­ing on one end and a pil­lar ob­struct­ing at the other.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, a town coun­cil spokesman said the walk­way was the first in a series of con­struc­tion mile­stones, and that the project aims to pro­vide un­fet­tered, shel­tered ac­cess from a nearby block to a bus stop next to the CC.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon, who was pre­vi­ously LTA’s chief trans­porta­tion en­gi­neer, noted that the au­thor­i­ties have to set pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Of course, this is no con­so­la­tion for res­i­dents who feel they should be high on the pri­or­ity list.”</p>
    <p>HDB and LTA said it would con­tinue to im­prove co­or­di­na­tion among var­i­ous agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Ms Ch­eryl Chan, an East Coast GRC MP who heads the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Na­tional Devel­op­ment, sug­gested hav­ing one agency over­see the en­tire project.</p>
    <p>“I usu­ally take town coun­cil as the lead, and we scru­ti­nise every sin­gle project to­gether with the town coun­cil­lors who are also res­i­dents here,” she said. “One of the key things is joint site vis­its to un­der­stand what’s on the ground.”</p>
    <p>Mr Menon called for more ef­fort in an­tic­i­pat­ing where in­fras­truc­tural is­sues, such as in the Pung­gol walk­way case, might oc­cur.</p>
    <p>“Start­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions with the own­ers of in­ter­ven­ing land early dur­ing the plan­ning stage will min­imise the pos­si­bil­i­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Leow Bok Wee, from trans­port con­sul­tancy Ver­tix, said the Pung­gol case showed how the power of so­cial me­dia and a quick­re­spond­ing Gov­ern­ment had com­bined for a pos­i­tive out­come.</p>
    <p>Not all see this as a good thing – in­clud­ing Ms Chan, who said it was more im­por­tant to be proac­tive.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple work­ing on projects sense that some­thing is wrong, they need to be able to raise it then,” she said. “Not wait till ev­ery­thing has fin­ished or when some­thing goes vi­ral.</p>
    <p>“If that is the means of do­ing it, we are just wast­ing a lot of funds and un­nec­es­sary steps.”</p>
