    <p>As if work­ing moth­ers did not have enough to worry about, ex­perts are sound­ing the alarm that progress to­wards gen­der equal­ity may be the lat­est in a long list of ca­su­al­ties of the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sub­stan­tial re­search has shown that most pro­fes­sional gen­der gaps are moth­er­hood gaps; women with­out chil­dren are much closer to par­ity with men when it comes to salaries and pro­mo­tions, but moth­ers pay a large ca­reer penalty.</p>
    <p>Women tend to take on more of the bur­den of car­ing for chil­dren and the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>To go to work, they need some­one to help with that care. But fa­thers have been slow to change their be­hav­iour. And with­out sub­si­dies, pri­vate child­care can be pro­hib­i­tively ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>Work­places al­ready tend to pe­nalise women who choose to work fewer hours or need more flex­i­bil­ity, and that, too, is prov­ing to be ex­ac­er­bated in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The bot­tom line is that, based on decades of re­search, we know that there was one in­sti­tu­tion that was ef­fec­tive at lim­it­ing gen­der in­equal­ity and en­cour­ag­ing women’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the work­place, and it was early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion,” said econ­o­mist Clau­dia Olivetti from the Univer­sity of Chicago.</p>
    <p>Now the pan­demic is tak­ing that away, too, pil­ing pres­sure on work­ing moth­ers.</p>
    <p>Around the world, work­ing women are fac­ing bru­tally hard choices about whether to stay home if they have not al­ready been laid off.</p>
    <p>And the ef­fect may be par­tic­u­larly se­vere in coun­tries like the United States, where the pan­demic is com­pound­ing in­equal­i­ties that women al­ready face as a re­sult of the lack of guar­an­teed paid ma­ter­nity leave and af­ford­able child­care.</p>
    <p>Is­rael is an ex­am­ple of the power of sub­sidised child­care to nar­row gen­der gaps at work as well as a cau­tion­ary tale about how eas­ily the pan­demic can shat­ter that frag­ile progress.</p>
    <p>The Is­raeli gov­ern­ment pro­vides free early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion from the age of three and meansteste­d day­care for many ba­bies and younger tod­dlers.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, women’s over­all labour force par­tic­i­pa­tion had reached 74 per cent, sig­nif­i­cantly higher than the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment av­er­age of 66 per cent.</p>
    <p>The gen­der wage gap, though per­sis­tent, was nar­row­ing.</p>
    <p>Then came Covid-19. Schools and day­care cen­tres closed i n midMarch, and the child­care that had al­lowed so many moth­ers to work was gone.</p>
    <p>Women al­ready held more pre­car­i­ous po­si­tions in the work­force – work­ing f ewer hours, for less money, with shorter tenures and in lower-rank­ing jobs than men.</p>
    <p>The l oss of child­care lim­ited many work­ing moth­ers’ hours and avail­abil­ity even fur­ther, mean­ing they were of­ten the first to be se­lected for lay­offs and un­paid leave.</p>
    <p>And many fam­i­lies ap­pear to be de­cid­ing that if they need one par­ent to give up a job and pri­ori­tise child­care, it should be the low­er­paid par­ent – usu­ally the mother.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, many Amer­i­can moth­ers were ef­fec­tively forced to stop work­ing for some pe­riod of time be­cause they could not af­ford paid child­care.</p>
    <p>And re­search shows that the longer a woman is out of the work­force, the more se­vere the longterm ef­fects on her earn­ings will be.</p>
    <p>A 2018 study by the In­sti­tute for Women’s Pol­icy Re­search found that an em­ploy­ment gap of four years or more leads to a whop­ping 65 per cent cut in an­nual earn­ings, com­pared with a 39 per cent de­crease af­ter a one-year break.</p>
    <p>As school clo­sures force women out of the work­place for a year or two more than planned, that will have life­long con­se­quences for their fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>A July re­port from McKin­sey Global found that in the US, where women made up 43 per cent of the work­force, they ac­counted for 56 per cent of Covid-19-re­lated job losses.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, Swe­den, which heav­ily sub­sidises child day­care and has one of the high­est rates of fe­male labour par­tic­i­pa­tion in the de­vel­oped world, has kept schools and day­care cen­tres open through­out the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Al­though this has been ques­tion­able as a pub­lic health strat­egy, it has al­lowed work­ing par­ents to avoid the bur­dens of lock­down.</p>
    <p>As with most so­cial phe­nom­ena, this plays out dif­fer­ently for wealthy women than for poor ones.</p>
    <p>Re­search shows that when hig­h­earn­ing cou­ples have chil­dren, they tend to di­vide re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>With one par­ent step­ping back from a ca­reer to take on the in­creased care du­ties, and the other mak­ing work a pri­or­ity, it is usu­ally the mother who steps back.</p>
    <p>Once on the “mummy track”, women make less money and have fewer op­por­tu­ni­ties for ad­vance­ment. “If the woman is the sec­ondary earner, then it is less costly at the mar­gin to cut her hours” when a cri­sis like the pan­demic hits, Dr Olivetti said.</p>
    <p>Poorer fam­i­lies tend to have more par­ity be­tween the par­ents’ earn­ings, but they rely on both in­comes to sur­vive and are also more likely to have jobs that must be done in per­son rather than re­motely. When schools and day­care cen­tres close, there is no one to look af­ter young chil­dren or su­per­vise older ones’ re­mote school­ing if both par­ents go out to work.</p>
    <p>But if one stays home, the fam­ily faces fi­nan­cial catas­tro­phe.</p>
    <p>“Try­ing to help work­ing fam­i­lies ease this child­care con­straint – it’s not just a gen­der in­equal­ity is­sue; it’s also an in­come in­equal­ity is­sue,” Dr Olivetti said.</p>
    <p>In short, the loss of school and day­care is go­ing to set women back by 10 years be­cause the only way for them to im­prove their pub­lic par­tic­i­pa­tion is by re­duc­ing the ex­tra bur­den of car­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties they have.</p>
    <p>Think lock­downs are bad for lux­ury? Think again.</p>
    <p>Sales at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s fash­ion and leather goods divi­sion rose 12 per cent, ex­clud­ing cur­rency move­ments, in its third quar­ter – not far off the lev­els it was achiev­ing be­fore the pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>The Bloomberg con­sen­sus of an­a­lysts’ ex­pec­ta­tions for the pe­riod was for a 0.9 per cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the bumper per­for­mance shows how de­mand for ex­pen­sive hand­bags, cars and watches bounced back once af­flu­ent con­sumers could emerge from their homes and spend some of the money they saved dur­ing lock­down.</p>
    <p>In China, whose con­sumers could ac­count for 45 per cent of global lux­ury sales this year, ac­cord­ing to fi­nan­cial ser­vices firm Jef­feries, shop­pers treated them­selves as stores re­opened.</p>
    <p>And this so-called “re­venge spend­ing” phe­nom­e­non has ex­panded to the US, and even Europe, as wealthy in­di­vid­u­als di­vert money they would have splurged on over­seas va­ca­tions and restau­rant din­ing to high-end bou­tiques.</p>
    <p>Un­til re­cently, stock mar­kets have re­bounded strongly, which typ­i­cally en­cour­ages US con­sumers to spend. Women may spring for a Chris­tian Dior Bobby bag. Men might shell out on a de­signer time­piece. Watches of Switzer­land Group, the Bri­tain-based watch and jew­ellery re­tailer, re­cently re­ported bet­ter-than-ex­pected sales.</p>
    <p>But these re­sults are not just con­fined to lux­ury items you can wear.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Mercedes-Benz owner Daim­ler re­ported a stun­ning €5.1 bil­lion (S$8.1 bil­lion) of in­dus­trial free cash flow for the July to Septem­ber quar­ter. Its mainly white-col­lar clien­tele ap­pear to have been less af­fected by the pan­demic than the hard-hit ser­vice sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Cars have also be­come pretty handy if you are wor­ried about us­ing pub­lic trans­port or con­sid­er­ing a move from the city to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mercedes-Benz’s big pres­ence in China, where sales rose 23 per cent year on year dur­ing the third quar­ter, has been a big ad­van­tage too.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, an­other ben­e­fi­ciary of this bling boom may be Ap­ple, whose top-of-the-range iPhone 12 Pro be­came avail­able for pre-or­der last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing saved some money dur­ing lock­down, con­sumers might be more will­ing to splurge on the more ex­pen­sive new hand­sets.</p>
    <p>But there are grounds for cau­tion, as the lux­ury re­cov­ery may not be evenly spread across the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>If con­sumers are go­ing to make a spe­cial pur­chase, it is likely to be from one of the best-known names.</p>
    <p>LVMH has two: Louis Vuitton and Chris­tian Dior. When it comes to watches, the hottest brands right now are Rolex (there are al­ready wait­ing lists for its new brightly coloured Oys­ter Per­pet­ual mod­els), Patek Philippe and Aude­mars Piguet – all pri­vately owned.</p>
    <p>Watches, hand­bags and jew­ellery are also items that work in ca­sual set­tings. Other high-fash­ion prod­ucts, such as for­mal dresses and stilet­tos, may be more af­fected by the lack of events to dress up for.</p>
    <p>An ex­cep­tion is Mon­cler’s puffer jack­ets, which could be in de­mand as win­ter ap­proaches, par­tic­u­larly if so­cial­is­ing has to move out­doors.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, as con­cern over the pan­demic’s eco­nomic toll mounts, the thrill of spend­ing may wane.</p>
    <p>Add in the dam­age from a sec­ond virus wave in Europe and un­cer­tainty around the US elec­tion, and even wealthy con­sumers may choose to stash, rather than splash, their cash.</p>
    <p>For now, how­ever, bling is back. Lux­ury goods groups should make the most of it while they can.</p>
