    <p>Ty­phoon Molave cut a wide swathe as it swept across the Philip­pines yes­ter­day, dump­ing heavy rains and bring­ing gale-force winds that up­rooted trees, in­un­dated villages and forced more than 100,000 peo­ple to evac­u­ate.</p>
    <p>Those forced out of their homes by the ty­phoon, lo­cally known as Quinta, are from Al­bay prov­ince and else­where across the Bi­col re­gion – home to al­most six mil­lion – and in nearby Que­zon prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Most of them live in dis­tricts prone to land­slides, flood­ing and storm surges.</p>
    <p>Im­ages posted on so­cial me­dia showed a woman wad­ing in wa­ters up to her shoul­ders, and a car al­most fully sub­merged in a vil­lage in Legazpi city in Al­bay, some 460km south-east of the cap­i­tal Manila.</p>
    <p>Disas­ter re­sponse of­fi­cials have yet to re­lease a full ac­count­ing of the dam­age.</p>
    <p>Molave made land­fall at around 6pm in Al­bay on Sun­day, and bar­relled its way through prov­inces in the south­ern part of the main is­land of Lu­zon and the north­ern­most part of the Visayas in cen­tral Philip­pines, with winds of up to 125kmh.</p>
    <p>The ty­phoon blew off roofs, knocked down walls of houses and flooded rice fields. It top­pled elec­tric posts and scat­tered wires across the road, cut­ting power to large parts of Al­bay.</p>
    <p>Dozens of out­rig­ger ca­noes were washed ashore in a fish­ing town on the is­land prov­ince of Ori­en­tal Min­doro. Knee-deep floods and large de­bris that blocked roads were re­ported in Cavite and Batan­gas prov­inces, just an hour south of Manila.</p>
    <p>The Coast Guard said a yacht sank off Bauan town in Batan­gas. Of the eight peo­ple on board, seven were res­cued, with the re­main­ing per­son yet to be found. The Na­tional Disas­ter Risk Re­duc­tion and Man­age­ment Coun­cil re­ported that at least 12 fish­er­men who set off from Catan­d­u­anes prov­ince are now miss­ing.</p>
    <p>Agence France-Presse re­ported that at least three peo­ple, in­clud­ing a baby, were killed. But the disas­ter man­age­ment coun­cil said it had yet to re­ceive ca­su­alty re­ports.</p>
    <p>Sea travel op­er­a­tions were can­celled in ports in Batan­gas, leav­ing some 500 stranded.</p>
    <p>Classes were sus­pended across Metro Manila, as strong winds con­tin­ued to pound the cap­i­tal as of noon yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Molave is a cat­e­gory 1 ty­phoon on a five-cat­e­gory scale, with 5 be­ing the strong­est.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to strengthen over the South China Sea as it heads to­wards cen­tral Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines is the first ma­jor land­mass fac­ing the Pa­cific cy­clone belt. It gets hit by an av­er­age of 20 storms and ty­phoons each year.</p>
