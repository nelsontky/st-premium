    <p>A to­tal of 233 Covid-19 swab sam­ples were ac­ci­den­tally dis­posed of be­fore they were tested, fol­low­ing lapses at a pri­vate med­i­cal lab.</p>
    <p>The batch was col­lected from clin­ics un­der the Swab and Send Home (Sash) pro­gramme. The test sam­ples were “in­ad­ver­tently dis­carded prior to test­ing” at the lab, a spokesman for Quest Lab­o­ra­to­ries told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Sash pro­gramme, pa­tients who meet cer­tain cri­te­ria are swabbed and then sent home to wait for their test re­sults. Their swab sam­ples are sent to a lab, where test­ing can take up to three work­ing days.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent at Quest Lab­o­ra­to­ries hap­pened last Wed­nes­day and was dis­cov­ered two days later when clin­ics be­gan con­tact­ing the lab to ask about the test re­sults for these pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said no other sam­ple batches were af­fected.</p>
    <p>One of the lapses in­volved an in­house courier who did not fol­low stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dure when hand­ing over the untested sam­ples to the lab. This re­sulted in the batch be­ing dis­posed of along­side old sam­ples. The spokesman added that all the sam­ples were dis­posed of ac­cord­ing to Covid-19 safety re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>As at Sun­day, the 87 af­fected clin­ics have been in­formed of the in­ci­dent and 102 pa­tients have been retested. Their re­sults have turned up neg­a­tive, said the lab.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry, which was no­ti­fied of the in­ci­dent last Fri­day, said it is work­ing with the lab and the clin­ics to con­tact the af­fected pa­tients to ar­range for them to be reswabbed as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The lab said the retested sam­ples will be pri­ori­tised to en­sure that af­fected pa­tients re­ceive their test re­sults with­out fur­ther de­lay.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times was alerted to the mat­ter by a pa­tient who took a swab test last Wed­nes­day at a Toa Payoh clinic af­ter suf­fer­ing from a runny nose and fever.</p>
    <p>When she did not re­ceive her re­sults two days later, her hus­band called the clinic and learnt that the de­lay was due to an in­ci­dent at Quest Lab­o­ra­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The woman, who de­clined to be iden­ti­fied, said the de­lay had in­con­ve­nienced both her hus­band and daugh­ter who had to stay home</p>
    <p>from work and school, re­spec­tively, while wait­ing for the re­sults.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it takes a se­ri­ous view of the in­ci­dent and is in­ves­ti­gat­ing the mat­ter. It added that it will work with the lab to put in place mea­sures so such lapses do not hap­pen again.</p>
    <p>“We will take ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tions against the lab­o­ra­tory if in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­veal any breach of the reg­u­la­tions. We will also re­mind the other li­censed lab­o­ra­to­ries on the need to en­sure proper staff train­ing and ad­her­ence to their stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures,” added the min­istry.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions by Quest Lab­o­ra­to­ries found two com­pli­ance lapses in its stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures (SOP) in­volv­ing the han­dling and dis­posal of spec­i­mens.</p>
    <p>The lab said: “The first lapse re­lates to the han­dover of spec­i­mens from the courier to the spec­i­men re</p>
    <p>cep­tion staff. This oc­curred at the same time the lab­o­ra­tory staff were dis­pos­ing of old spec­i­mens.</p>
    <p>“As a sec­ond lapse of SOP, lab­o­ra­tory staff were dis­pos­ing of spec­i­mens in the spec­i­men re­cep­tion area, lead­ing to the er­ro­neous dis­posal of the untested batch.”</p>
    <p>The lab spokesman said rel­e­vant em­ploy­ees have been no­ti­fied of the spe­cific is­sues that led to the in­ci­dent and the reper­cus­sions. The in-house courier will also re­ceive dis­ci­plinary ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The lab said it has car­ried out a re­view of the in­ci­dent and has im­ple­mented cor­rec­tive and pre­ven­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Quest Lab­o­ra­to­ries’ chief ex­ec­u­tive Ginny Foo said com­pli­ance with pro­ce­dures re­lat­ing to the chain of cus­tody is taken very se­ri­ously and that this is the first time such an in­ci­dent has hap­pened at the lab.</p>
    <p>“Nev­er­the­less, any such lapse is un</p>
    <p>ac­cept­able. We have made re­vi­sions to tighten our chain of cus­tody, and re­train­ing of staff on the new SOP has al­ready be­gun,” she said.</p>
    <p>New mea­sures im­ple­mented in­clude colour-cod­ing con­tain­ers meant for sam­ple de­liv­ery to en­sure they are eas­ily distin­guished from con­tain­ers meant for dis­posal.</p>
    <p>This will re­move the chance of con­fu­sion be­tween in­com­ing untested sam­ple batches and batches that have al­ready been tested and have to be dis­posed of.</p>
    <p>The lab has also added a sec­ond ver­i­fi­ca­tion step, re­quir­ing all sam­ples for dis­posal to be ver­i­fied and signed off by two in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Foo: “We deeply re­gret this fail­ure of our sys­tems and the in­con­ve­nience this has caused to the pa­tients, the doc­tors, and clinic staff in­volved.”</p>
    <p>The first lapse re­lates to the han­dover of spec­i­mens from the courier to the spec­i­men re­cep­tion staff. This oc­curred at the same time the lab­o­ra­tory staff were dis­pos­ing of old spec­i­mens. As a sec­ond lapse of SOP, lab­o­ra­tory staff were dis­pos­ing of spec­i­mens in the spec­i­men re­cep­tion area, lead­ing to the er­ro­neous dis­posal of the untested batch.</p>
    <p>QUEST LAB­O­RA­TO­RIES, which found two com­pli­ance lapses in its stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures in­volv­ing the han­dling and dis­posal of spec­i­mens.</p>
