    <p>The Aus­tralian state of Vic­to­ria has fi­nally brought its sec­ond wave of Covid-19 cases to an end, be­com­ing one of the world’s more suc­cess­ful gov­ern­ments at do­ing so.</p>
    <p>The state of about 6.7 million res­i­dents recorded just three new cases yes­ter­day. On Tues­day, it recorded only one case, a per­son who tested pos­i­tive in July and is be­lieved to be a rare case of re­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>This is a dra­matic turn­around from early Au­gust, when new daily coron­avirus cases peaked at 687.</p>
    <p>That was due to an out­break that is be­lieved to have orig­i­nated from se­cu­rity guards who be­came in­fected while work­ing at quar­an­tine ho­tels.</p>
    <p>But Vic­to­ria’s mea­sures to curb the out­break proved con­tro­ver­sial.</p>
    <p>The state gov­ern­ment placed its cap­i­tal city Melbourne un­der strict lock­down, clos­ing schools and many busi­nesses. It also im­posed a nightly cur­few, which ended last month.</p>
    <p>Strin­gent mea­sures re­main in place, even though new cases of in­fec­tion have av­er­aged three per day over the last week.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment eased re­stric­tions from the start of this week, but din­ing at cafes and restau­rants and work­ing in of­fices are still pro­hib­ited. Most re­tail stores are closed, Melbourne res­i­dents can­not leave the city, and gath­er­ings are lim­ited to 10 peo­ple. These re­stric­tions are due to be fur­ther eased from Nov 2, as long as case num­bers re­main low.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s Premier, Mr Daniel Andrews, has come un­der heavy pres­sure over his cau­tious ap­proach.</p>
    <p>“We have to deal with the health prob­lem first,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the ap­par­ent re­in­fec­tion, he said: “It is through an abun­dance of cau­tion that we are as­sum­ing that is a pos­i­tive case, rather than the per­son shed­ding af­ter the orig­i­nal in­fec­tion.”</p>
    <p>The state’s sec­ond wave ap­pears to have taken a per­sonal toll on the Premier, par­tic­u­larly as he and his gov­ern­ment have been heav­ily blamed for ho­tel quar­an­tine breaches and in­ad­e­quate con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, Mr Andrews has seemed de­ter­mined to com­pletely crush the virus and avoid any risk of its re­turn.</p>
    <p>But he is fac­ing in­tense and grow­ing crit­i­cism over his re­fusal to swiftly re­open the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Trea­surer, Mr Josh Fry­den­berg, launched a sav­age at­tack on Mr Andrews this week, ac­cus­ing him of “un­for­giv­able” stub­born­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Fry­den­berg, who lives in Melbourne, said Vic­to­ria is home to 26 per cent of Aus­tralia’s pop­u­la­tion, but ac­counted for 40 per cent of the na­tion’s un­em­ployed work­ers.</p>
    <p>“There’s been a cal­lous in­dif­fer­ence by the Vic­to­rian gov­ern­ment to the loss of jobs in the state and the plight of small busi­ness,” Mr Fry­den­berg said in a video he posted on­line.</p>
    <p>“More than 1,000 Vic­to­ri­ans have lost their jobs ev­ery day as a re­sult of the lock­down... The bloody-mind­ed­ness is un­for­giv­able.”</p>
    <p>Busi­ness groups have also at­tacked Mr Andrews, say­ing the eas­ing of re­stric­tions has been too slow.</p>
    <p>In a joint let­ter to Mr Andrews, the heads of seven ma­jor Aus­tralian firms, in­clud­ing BHP and the Com­mon­wealth Bank, urged him to ex­pe­dite the open­ing of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“We urge you now, in light of the ex­cel­lent re­cent progress, to per­mit the care­ful and staged re­turn to the work­place of of­fice work­ers and the small busi­nesses that pro­vide ser­vices to them,” said the let­ter, ac­cord­ing to Tues­day’s re­port in The Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald.</p>
    <p>But Mr Andrews ap­pears to have the pub­lic on his side.</p>
    <p>An opin­ion poll in The Aus­tralian late last month found 62 per cent of Vic­to­ri­ans be­lieved the Premier had han­dled the cri­sis well, 34 per cent thought he had han­dled it badly and the re­main­der were un­com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Mr Andrews con­tin­ues to de­fi­antly stand by his ap­proach. On Mon­day, he at­tacked Mr Fry­den­berg for “(play­ing) pol­i­tics in the midst of a global pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>“Vic­to­ri­ans want their fam­ily pro­tected, they want their health is­sues dealt with so we can open up,” he said.</p>

Just three new Covid-19 cases were re&#xAD;ported in the Aus&#xAD;tralian state yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day, a dra&#xAD;matic turn&#xAD;around from early Au&#xAD;gust, when the num&#xAD;ber of new daily cases peaked at 687.</p>
