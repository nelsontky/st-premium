    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump de­moted his long-time cam­paign man­ager on Wed­nes­day, a move aimed at shoring up his re­elec­tion bid as he trails Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den in opin­ion polls less than four months be­fore the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Mr Trump said cam­paign man­ager Brad Parscale would be re­placed by Mr Bill Stepien, who has been the deputy cam­paign man­ager.</p>
    <p>Mr Parscale will shift to a role fo­cused on dig­i­tal and data strat­egy, the Pres­i­dent said.</p>
    <p>A cam­paign lead­er­ship shake-up had long been ru­moured.</p>
    <p>Mr Parscale was blamed in­ter­nally for a botched rally in Tulsa, Ok­la­homa, last month that drew a much smaller crowd than he pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus out­break had also forced Mr Parscale and other cam­paign of­fi­cials who at­tended the rally to self-quar­an­tine for two weeks.</p>
    <p>A source close to the cam­paign said Mr Trump has been anx­ious about the polls “and struck at the most vis­i­ble tar­get he could”, adding that Mr Parscale has been “a straight-shooter about the Pres­i­dent’s chal­lenges”.</p>
    <p>Mr Stepien, a long-time Repub­li­can strate­gist, is well known to both Mr Trump and his son-in-law, Mr Jared Kush­ner, who has been play­ing a more ac­tive role in the cam­paign. Mr Stepien was po­lit­i­cal di­rec­tor at the White House be­fore mov­ing to the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>In his state­ment, Mr Trump cred­ited both Mr Parscale and Mr Stepien for their in­volve­ment in his 2016 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion vic­tory and pre­dicted that he would glide to a sec­ond term in of­fice.</p>
    <p>“This one should be a lot eas­ier as our poll num­bers are ris­ing fast, the econ­omy is get­ting bet­ter, vac­cines and ther­a­peu­tics will soon be on the way, and Amer­i­cans want safe streets and com­mu­ni­ties,” Mr</p>
    <p>Trump wrote.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can leader has pub­licly scoffed at the nu­mer­ous opin­ion polls show­ing him be­hind Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump trailed Mr Bi­den by 10 per­cent­age points among reg­is­tered vot­ers in the lat­est Reuters/ Ip­sos poll.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s stand­ing among vot­ers has sagged this year as the coro­n­avirus has killed over 140,000 Amer­i­cans and thrown mil­lions more out of work.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has blamed Mr Trump for not tak­ing more dra­matic steps to cur­tail the pan­demic’s spread.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans are strug­gling to re­cal­i­brate as re­stric­tions on large, in-per­son events have mostly side­lined Mr Trump’s sig­na­ture cam­paign ral­lies.</p>
    <p>Plans for his nom­i­nat­ing con­ven­tion in Jack­sonville, Florida, re­main up in the air with lit­tle more than a month be­fore it is sched­uled to be­gin.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can of­fi­cials are plan­ning to move most ac­tiv­i­ties there out­doors.</p>
    <p>Democrats are also par­ing back their in-per­son event sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ad­vis­ers have pri­vately lev­elled crit­i­cism that the re-elec­tion cam­paign lacks a cen­tral mes­sage.</p>
    <p>But they said Mr Trump shared the blame be­cause he lacked dis­ci­pline on how to com­mu­ni­cate what he would do with an­other fouryear term in the White House.</p>
