    <p>Along a 3km stretch of Up­per Serangoon Road stand three re­li­gious in­sti­tu­tions that have stood the test of time.</p>
    <p>The Church of the Na­tiv­ity of the Blessed Vir­gin Mary, Hougang Tou Mu Kung and Haji Yu­soff Mosque have a com­bined age of al­most four cen­turies, with the church and the tem­ple gazetted as na­tional mon­u­ments. The road it­self is al­most 200 years old.</p>
    <p>These places of wor­ship are among 18 sites on the Na­tional Her­itage Board’s (NHB) lat­est self­guided trail – the Hougang Her­itage Trail – that was un­veiled yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The trail, the NHB’s 20th, fol­lows af­ter the heart­land trail in Pasir Ris launched last De­cem­ber. The board had said then that it planned to launch more of such heart­land trails to bring the na­tion’s her­itage to the doorsteps of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>With sto­ries and pho­tos from 28 in­di­vid­u­als fa­mil­iar with Hougang, this new trail has the high­est num­ber of com­mu­nity con­tri­bu­tions of all NHB trails. Oth­ers have about 10 to 20 com­mu­nity con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Bernard James Braberry, a parish ad­min­is­tra­tor at the Church of the Na­tiv­ity of the Blessed Vir­gin Mary and a Hougang res­i­dent since 1985, said: “What is spe­cial about the town to me are its peo­ple, and how spir­i­tual they are.</p>
    <p>“In the wee hours when our church gates were open be­fore Covid-19 struck, many would come and of­fer prayers, no mat­ter what re­li­gion they are from.”</p>
    <p>It is con­tri­bu­tions like this – be­yond his­tor­i­cal facts – that help make the trail more in­ter­est­ing for par­tic­i­pants, said NHB’s deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of pol­icy and com­mu­nity Alvin Tan.</p>
    <p>Three the­matic routes through</p>
    <p>Hougang cater to vary­ing in­ter­ests. The first takes vis­i­tors along a stretch of Up­per Serangoon Road, high­light­ing eight land­marks in­clud­ing re­li­gious sites and old busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Those keen to find out more about com­mu­nity groups such as char­i­ta­ble halls and clan as­so­ci­a­tions can go on the In­sti­tu­tions Of Ser­vice route which takes vis­i­tors to six sites.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, those in­ter­ested in build­ing de­sign will en­joy the Ar­chi­tec­tural Gems route, which fea­tures seven built her­itage sites along the trail.</p>
    <p>Hougang MP Den­nis Tan said: “I hope the trail will pro­vide more in­sights to res­i­dents, as well as oth­ers liv­ing out­side the Hougang area, about the unique his­tory of the area and its dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties and even vil­lages, as well as its devel­op­ment over the years.</p>
    <p>“I also hope that it will pro­voke in­ter­est and cu­rios­ity among Sin­ga­pore­ans to find out more about life in Hougang in the early years of Sin­ga­pore, which I my­self have cer­tainly found from my res­i­dents’ anec­dotes to be very in­ter­est­ing.”</p>
    <p>NHB’s Mr Tan said the board hopes to en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to ex­plore their own back­yards through its trails dur­ing this pe­riod of travel re­stric­tions and to re­dis­cover lo­cal her­itage de­lights.</p>
    <p>“We hope that Sin­ga­pore­ans will come away with a re­newed ap­pre­ci­a­tion of what Sin­ga­pore has to of­fer in terms of unique her­itage ex­pe­ri­ences with a strong lo­cal ap­peal,” he added.</p>
    <p>Her­itage buffs can ex­pect three more trails to be launched next year.</p>
    <p>The Hougang Her­itage Trail’s com­pan­ion guide and map are avail­able in four lan­guages, and can be down­loaded from NHB’s her­itage por­tal, Roots.sg, while hard copies are avail­able at the Alju­niedHougan­g Town Coun­cil (Hougang Of­fice), as well as com­mu­nity clubs and cen­tres is­land­wide.</p>
