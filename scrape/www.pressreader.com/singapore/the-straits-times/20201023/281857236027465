    <p>Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tions here, in­clud­ing the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis), have con­demned the be­head­ing of a teacher in France after he showed car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Muham­mad in class.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tions also called for an end to vi­o­lence and ter­ror­ism in the name of re­li­gion, and said yes­ter­day that such acts run counter to the val­ues of Is­lam.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, 47-year-old his­tory teacher Sa­muel Paty was vi­o­lently be­headed by 18-year-old Ab­dul­lakh An­zorov in a sub­urb north of Paris.</p>
    <p>An­zorov, orig­i­nally from the Rus­sian re­gion of Chech­nya, was later shot dead by the po­lice. Mr Paty had shown car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Muham­mad in a class on free­dom of ex­pres­sion, which in­cited anger among some Mus­lim fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>A photo of Mr Paty and a mes­sage claim­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity for his mur­der were found on An­zorov’s cell­phone. He had also tweeted im­ages of the teacher’s dead body.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Re­li­gious Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Group (RRG) in Sin­ga­pore told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that such a vi­o­lent act is in con­tempt of the teach­ings of Is­lam, and such crimes are a se­ri­ous set­back to in­ter­faith har­mony that the global com­mu­nity strives to­wards.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2003, the RRG is a non-profit group that trains re­li­gious teach­ers to coun­sel those in­flu­enced or mis­guided by rad­i­cal teach­ings. Said the spokesman: “All acts of in­dis­crim­i­nate vi­o­lence and ter­ror­ism can­not hide be­hind any re­li­gion or be­lief, for all faith teaches us to re­spect the other and to pre­serve hu­man­ity.”</p>
    <p>This sen­ti­ment was echoed by non-profit group AMP Sin­ga­pore, for­merly known as the As­so­ci­a­tion of Mus­lim Pro­fes­sion­als. It said ex­treme in­ter­pre­ta­tions of be­liefs can be detri­men­tal to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“In a world where dif­fer­ing views are eas­ily con­sumed by Sin­ga­pore­ans, it can get us di­vided as a na­tion. Frank and re­spect­ful dis­cus­sions on sen­si­tive is­sues such as re­li­gion must con­tinue.”</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Mus­lim Women’s As­so­ci­a­tion em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of safe­guard­ing the so­cial co­he­sion that Sin­ga­pore has built, adding that it hopes the in­ci­dent in France will re­mind Sin­ga­pore­ans not to take this for granted.</p>
    <p>The day after news of the be­head­ing in France broke, Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, Sin­ga­pore’s high­est Is­lamic au­thor­ity, ex­pressed his shock and sad­ness over the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>In a post on the Face­book page of Muis, he said mur­der in Prophet Muham­mad’s name is “the most heinous of crimes” and that such acts are in­ex­cus­able.</p>
    <p>“All it does is to breed fur­ther con­tempt and di­vi­sion, forc­ing Mus­lim com­mu­ni­ties to be on the de­fen­sive, and putting at risk the hard work of so many peace-lov­ing Mus­lim com­mu­ni­ties around the world,” Dr Nazirudin said, call­ing on Mus­lims to stand firmly against all forms of vi­o­lence and hate speech.</p>
    <p>In France, the vi­o­lent in­ci­dent has prompted a govern­ment crack­down on rad­i­cal Is­lam.</p>
    <p>French po­lice have re­port­edly car­ried out dozens of raids, while the govern­ment has or­dered a six­month clo­sure of a mosque out­side Paris and plans to dis­solve a group it said sup­ported Pales­tinian mil­i­tant group Ha­mas.</p>
    <p>Mr Paty’s be­head­ing was the sec­ond knife attack in the name of aveng­ing Prophet Muham­mad since a trial started last month on the 2015 Char­lie Hebdo killings in which 12 peo­ple, in­clud­ing car­toon­ists, were gunned down.</p>
    <p>In the first attack, a man armed with a meat cleaver stabbed two peo­ple out­side the for­mer Paris of­fices of satir­i­cal mag­a­zine Char­lie Hebdo.</p>
