    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo’s up­com­ing visit to Asia demon­strates Wash­ing­ton’s strong com­mit­ment to al­lies and part­ners in the re­gion, the top Amer­i­can diplo­mat for East Asia, Mr David Stil­well, has said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo on Fri­day said he would go ahead with his planned trip to Ja­pan, South Korea and Mon­go­lia, after Pres­i­dent Donald Trump tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Sec­re­tary of State was due to leave Europe for Tokyo yes­ter­day. He told re­porters trav­el­ling with him on a visit to Croatia that both he and his wife tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 20 min­utes be­fore land­ing in Dubrovnik on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo, who is fourth in line</p>
    <p>to suc­ceed the Pres­i­dent if nec­es­sary, said he last saw Mr Trump on Sept 15.</p>
    <p>In a brief­ing call on the trip for re­porters, Mr Stil­well said the United States saw the de­ci­sion by newly minted Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga to host Mr Pom­peo as a reaf­fir­ma­tion of an ev­er­strength­en­ing part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>Mr Stil­well called the US-Ja­pan re­la­tion­ship “the corner­stone of peace, se­cu­rity and pros­per­ity for the Indo-Pa­cific” re­gion.</p>
    <p>Asked if a min­is­te­rial meet­ing of the Quad group­ing of the US, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and In­dia on Tues­day would pro­duce a joint state­ment, he said “prob­a­bly not”.</p>
    <p>There were a lot of ar­eas for dis­cus­sion in the four-way group­ing, but these could be “free-form as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is the won­der­ful thing about the Quad... We have shared val­ues, but dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives, and from those come great ideas and el­e­gant so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Stil­well said the Quad, which China has de­nounced as an at­tempt to con­tain its de­vel­op­ment, was fo­cused on fur­ther­ing “a shared vi­sion of a free, open and in­clu­sive Indo-Pa­cific... es­pe­cially as (China’s) tac­tics of ag­gres­sion and co­er­cion in­crease in the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>Re­cent dis­cus­sions among the Quad had fo­cused on build­ing co­op­er­a­tion on is­sues in­clud­ing mar­itime se­cu­rity and on crit­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, in­fras­truc­ture and counter-ter­ror­ism, he added.</p>
    <p>China-US re­la­tions have sunk to the low­est point in decades in the run-up to the Nov 3 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. The world’s two big­gest economies have clashed bit­terly over var­i­ous is­sues – from trade and tech­no­log­i­cal and se­cu­rity ri­valry to hu­man rights and the re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus, which first sur­faced in Wuhan, China, late last year.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s al­lies and part­ners in Asia share US con­cerns about China’s in­creas­ingly as­sertive be­hav­iour and ex­ten­sive ter­ri­to­rial claims, but an­a­lysts say they have also been con­cerned about the tone of some of Mr Pom­peo and Mr Trump’s rhetoric against Bei­jing.</p>
