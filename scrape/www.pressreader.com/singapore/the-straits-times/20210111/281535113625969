    <p>United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told law­mak­ers to be “pre­pared to re­turn to Washington” this week, sug­gest­ing she is con­sid­er­ing im­peach­ment or an­other for­mal re­sponse to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s en­cour­age­ment of his sup­port­ers who at­tacked the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told law­mak­ers to be “pre­pared to re­turn to Washington” this week, sug­gest­ing she is con­sid­er­ing im­peach­ment or an­other for­mal re­sponse to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s en­cour­age­ment of sup­port­ers who at­tacked the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to fel­low Democrats, Mrs Pelosi stopped short of say­ing whether she in­tended to move for­ward with im­peach­ment or an­other process aimed at re­mov­ing Mr Trump from of­fice be­fore his term ex­pires on Jan 20, yet she in­sisted that he be held re­spon­si­ble in some fash­ion.</p>
    <p>“It is ab­so­lutely es­sen­tial that those who per­pe­trated the as­sault on our democ­racy be held ac­count­able,” she said in the let­ter re­leased late on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“There must be a recog­ni­tion that this des­e­cra­tion was in­sti­gated by the Pres­i­dent.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi has called on Mr Trump to re­sign over last Wed­nes­day’s vi­o­lent storm­ing of the Capi­tol and raised the prospect of im­peach­ment un­less he leaves of­fice im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Five peo­ple died in the at­tack, in­clud­ing a po­lice of­fi­cer, after Trump sup­port­ers broke through se­cu­rity bar­ri­ers and ram­paged through the Capi­tol build­ing, forc­ing law­mak­ers to evac­u­ate while they were count­ing Elec­toral Col­lege votes.</p>
    <p>Yet, the House Speaker is mov</p>
    <p>ing cau­tiously even as she faces pres­sure from an­gry Democrats to im­peach Mr Trump for a sec­ond time. Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has made it clear he wants the party to fo­cus on his agenda and fight­ing the coro­n­avirus rather than pur­su­ing an­other im­peach­ment.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi said in her let­ter that</p>
    <p>she will con­tinue to meet law­mak­ers and con­sti­tu­tional ex­perts, but added: “I urge you to be pre­pared to re­turn to Washington this week.”</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, she said that she had told the Rules Com­mit­tee to be ready to move for­ward with an im­peach­ment case, but stopped short</p>
    <p>of say­ing it would be brought to a vote.</p>
    <p>For Demo­cratic lead­ers, there is lit­tle risk in pres­sur­ing Mr Trump’s Cabi­net and Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence to in­voke the 25th Amend­ment to de­clare the pres­i­dent in­ca­pable of gov­ern­ing. But im­peach­ment would put the</p>
    <p>spot­light on Mr Trump in­stead of on pre­par­ing for Mr Bi­den’s in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>It could also mean a Se­nate im­peach­ment trial dur­ing the first days of Mr Bi­den’s pres­i­dency, forc­ing the cham­ber to set aside other busi­ness, in­clud­ing con­firm­ing a new Cabi­net.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, when asked on Fri­day about im­peach­ing Mr Trump, said that was a judge­ment for Congress to make.</p>
    <p>But he also ap­peared to sug­gest tap­ping the brakes on such a po­lit­i­cally fraught move, with only 10 days un­til his in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant we get on with the busi­ness of get­ting him out of of­fice. The quick­est way that that will hap­pen is us be­ing sworn in on the 20th,” Mr Bi­den said. “I am fo­cused now on us tak­ing con­trol as pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent on the 20th, and to get our agenda mov­ing as quickly as we can.”</p>
    <p>A group of House Democrats plans to un­veil on Mon­day an Ar­ti­cle of Im­peach­ment that had 180 cospon­sors by Satur­day af­ter­noon, ac­cord­ing to Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ted Lieu of Cal­i­for­nia. Democrats hold 222 seats in the House.</p>
    <p>“We will in­tro­duce the Ar­ti­cle of Im­peach­ment this Mon­day dur­ing the House’s pro forma ses­sion,” Mr Lieu said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The text of the pro­posed im­peach­ment res­o­lu­tion in­cludes a sin­gle ar­ti­cle ac­cus­ing Mr Trump of “In­cite­ment of In­sur­rec­tion” and says he en­gaged in high crimes and mis­de­meanours by “wil­fully in­cit­ing vi­o­lence against the gov­ern­ment of the United States” in con­nec­tion with the storm­ing of the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive David Ci­cilline, a Rhode Is­land Demo­crat and one of the res­o­lu­tion’s spon­sors, said on CNN: “We can do this by way of priv­i­leged res­o­lu­tion, when we’re meet­ing in pro forma on Mon­day, we can in­tro­duce it. Then, the lead­er­ship will de­cide whether or not we will take it up and whether they will call us back into ses­sion.”</p>
    <p>Any at­tempt to im­peach Mr Trump would be running up against the cal­en­dar as well as against di­vi­sions among Repub­li­cans over how to con­tain the Pres­i­dent dur­ing his fi­nal days in of­fice.</p>
    <p>The House would have just days to act be­fore Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion, and it is not clear that the Se­nate could move ahead with a trial within a week. Con­vict­ing Mr Trump would re­quire sup­port from a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of GOP sen­a­tors.</p>
