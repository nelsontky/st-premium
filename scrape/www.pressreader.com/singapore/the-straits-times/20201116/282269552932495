    <p>For Ad­san Law, ranked at the top in the rarely high­lighted best law firm cat­e­gory for char­i­ties, non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions and pro bono work, it is peo­ple who mat­ter and are placed at the core of its le­gal prac­tice.</p>
    <p>First es­tab­lished as a part­ner­ship, Yeo-Leong & Peh in 1987, the prac­tice has since de­vel­oped into a mid­sized law cor­po­ra­tion, un­der­gone a dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and re­branded it­self as Ad­san Law LLC.</p>
    <p>The only other five-star rated law firm in this cat­e­gory of ST Best Law Firms is Quahe, Woo & Palmer. Allen & Gled­hill, Den­tons Rodyk & David­son, and Ra­jah & Tann are in the next four-star tier, based on the num­ber of rec­om­men­da­tions from the le­gal pro­fes­sion and clients.</p>
    <p>“At the core of our le­gal prac­tice is peo­ple. We be­lieve in giv­ing back by mak­ing mean­ing­ful im­pact on the lives of oth­ers, and on the com­mu­nity as a whole,” said Ad­san Law chief ex­ec­u­tive Su­san Leong.</p>
    <p>“Through­out the years, our se­nior lead­ers, lawyers and staff have ded­i­cated their time and knowl­edge to as­sist in pro bono work,” she added.</p>
    <p>“The heart of our cor­po­rate phi­los­o­phy and legacy re­volves around help­ing oth­ers from di­verse walks of life and there­fore weav­ing a strong and mean­ing­ful ta­pes­try of life with the work that we do, pro­fes­sion­ally and char­i­ta­bly.”</p>
    <p>Ad­san Law chair­man Adrian Peh is a Jus­tice of the Peace, serves on the Crim­i­nal Law Ad­vi­sory Com­mit­tee, and is a mem­ber of the Board of Vis­it­ing Jus­tices and Board of In­spec­tion un­der the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Mr Peh is a board mem­ber of the</p>
    <p>Chi­nese De­vel­op­ment As­sis­tance Coun­cil and a stand­ing coun­cil mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try. He also serves on the board of var­i­ous foun­da­tions, hav­ing pre­vi­ously served on the Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion of Sin­ga­pore and other bod­ies and com­mit­tees.</p>
    <p>Madam Leong, who is also vice chair­man, is one of the found­ing di­rec­tors of Jazz As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore). She also sits on the board of the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Or­ches­tra, is a men­tor of the Young Women’s Lead­er­ship Con­nec­tion and a di­rec­tor of Kwong Wai Shiu Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>“Just re­cently, we ad­vised on the pro­cesses and doc­u­men­ta­tion of a new cri­sis fund set up by the Jazz As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) that will award a one-time grant to lo­cal jazz mu­si­cians whose earn­ings have</p>
    <p>been im­pacted by crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic, or health is­sues which pre­vent them from be­ing able to work,” said Madam Leong.</p>
    <p>She and Mr Peh serve on boards of var­i­ous char­i­ties and non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions, and have as­sisted them on a pro bono ba­sis to re­view con­tracts, pro­cesses and re­view gov­er­nance and com­pli­ance is­sues.</p>
    <p>“We are strongly com­mit­ted to con­stantly look­ing at smarter and more ef­fec­tive ways to pro­vide op­ti­mal ser­vices,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We are hon­oured and hum­bled to re­ceive recog­ni­tion as one of the best law firms in this cat­e­gory and are grate­ful to our clients and friends for their trust and sup­port.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue with our ef­forts to con­trib­ute to­wards the com­mu­nity and do our part to build a com­pas­sion­ate and mean­ing­ful so­ci­ety,” added Madam Leong.</p>
