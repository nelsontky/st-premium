    <p>LIS­BON • When Hansi Flick took over Bay­ern Mu­nich last Novem­ber, Ger­man me­dia then claimed the Bavar­ian gi­ants no longer had a fear fac­tor.</p>
    <p>Nine months later, their stand­ing in Europe has never been higher.</p>
    <p>Sun­day’s 1-0 win over Paris Sain­tGer­main in the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal en­sured their sec­ond-ever tre­ble, seven years af­ter first achiev­ing the feat.</p>
    <p>They also be­came the first team to lift the tro­phy with a 100 per cent record, scor­ing 43 times i n 11 matches and lead­ing Flick to praise the “crazy” devel­op­ment of the six­time Euro­pean Cup winners.</p>
    <p>“I am proud of the team. When I saw the head­lines in Novem­ber, all I read was that no­body is afraid of</p>
    <p>Bay­ern any more,” said the 2014 World Cup-win­ning as­sis­tant who is in his first job as a head coach.</p>
    <p>“We de­served to win, be­cause of the sec­ond half. You could al­ready see in train­ing at our win­ter camp in Jan­uary that some­thing big was grow­ing. The team just has this over­whelm­ing will to win.”</p>
    <p>Bay­ern are sim­ply not in the busi­ness of los­ing, even when they are not at their steam­rolling best.</p>
    <p>Flick’s team did not show the over­whelm­ing of­fence that they dis­played in their 8-2 crush­ing of Barcelona in the quar­ter-fi­nals, nor the dom­i­nance of the ball in the 3-0 semi-fi­nal win over Lyon.</p>
    <p>But once they grabbed the lead against the French cham­pi­ons in the 59th minute through PSG youth team grad­u­ate Kings­ley Co­man, Bay­ern never looked like let­ting their grip on the game slip.</p>
    <p>Un­beaten this year, a draw in the Bun­desliga with RB Leipzig in Fe­bru­ary was the only time they dropped points, and that was be­fore the coro­n­avirus-en­forced break in March.</p>
    <p>Their vic­tory on Sun­day was their 21st in a row and like every great Ger­man team, Bay­ern are a col­lec­tive force in a man­ner that PSG, for all their ex­pen­sive big names, are still try­ing to be­come.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man cham­pi­ons also have Flick, whose magic touch was ev­i­dent again with the de­ci­sion to start Co­man ahead of Croa­tia winger Ivan Perisic, who was picked for the pre­vi­ous two games in Lis­bon.</p>
    <p>The 55-year-old re­vealed his rea­son­ing be­hind Co­man’s se­lec­tion as he felt the France winger had some­thing to prove against his for­mer side.</p>
    <p>“We play against Paris. PSG is the club he was raised in. This might be ad­di­tional mo­ti­va­tion for him,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­tute man-man­age­ment be­lies Flick’s rel­a­tive in­ex­pe­ri­ence in the hot seat, and he has forged a team spirit in the dress­ing room that seemed un­likely af­ter pre­de­ces­sor Niko Ko­vac was sacked fol­low­ing an un­der­whelm­ing start to the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Joshua Kim­mich, whose chipped cross was on a plate for Co­man’s headed win­ner, likened their bond to a “band of broth­ers”.</p>
    <p>“Hansi Flick showed a lot of trust in us from the be­gin­ning,” said the Ger­man in­ter­na­tional. “We al­ready had a bit of a feel­ing of be­ing un­beat­able. We de­served to win this com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­pos­si­ble to de­scribe what it feels like to stand on the pitch with such a team. It’s like play­ing with broth­ers, it doesn’t get bet­ter than that. Even if you make a mis</p>
    <p>KINGLY MO­MENT</p>
    <p>We play against Paris. PSG is the club he was raised in. This might be ad­di­tional mo­ti­va­tion for him. ’’</p>
    <p>HANSI FLICK, Bay­ern Mu­nich coach, on plump­ing for match-win­ner Kings­ley Co­man to start the fi­nal. The French­man played three games for the beaten fi­nal­ists be­fore leav­ing on a free trans­fer.</p>
    <p>take, some­one else makes up for it.”</p>
    <p>That will­ing­ness to give ev­ery­thing for the cause is what sets Bay­ern apart from their coun­ter­parts. And true to ethos, Flick sought to high­light the core strength of his side.</p>
    <p>“The team is al­ways in the fore­ground,” he said.</p>
    <p>In Paris, an­gry PSG fans ri­oted, set­ting cars ablaze and clash­ing with po­lice on the Champs-El­y­sees.</p>
    <p>Many shops were van­dalised, with French po­lice con­firm­ing over 150 peo­ple have been ar­rested. Things were, how­ever, calmer in Mu­nich as sup­port­ers cel­e­brated, while keep­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing in mind.</p>
