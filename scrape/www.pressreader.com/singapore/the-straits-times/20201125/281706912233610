    <p>Man­ag­ing the pan­demic re­mains Sin­ga­pore’s first pri­or­ity, even as eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties grad­u­ally re­sume, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Point­ing at how a resur­gence in Covid-19 cases in other coun­tries has posed dif­fi­cul­ties for their eco­nomic re­cov­ery, he said the ques­tion of whether to save lives or liveli­hoods amid the pan­demic is not bi­nary.</p>
    <p>“The bet­ter we are able to man­age the pan­demic, the bet­ter we are able to pro­tect jobs,” he said.</p>
    <p>This also sets the pan­demic apart from past crises such as the 1997 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis and the 2007-09 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, said Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>While all the crises have sent sud­den shocks to the econ­omy, the big dif­fer­ence in the cur­rent re­ces­sion is that it has been trig­gered by the pan­demic, so Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic tra­jec­tory de­pends crit­i­cally on its abil­ity to man­age the virus out­break, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng was speak­ing at a panel dis­cus­sion of the 35th edi­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Awards, an an­nual event jointly or­gan­ised by The Busi­ness Times and DHL Ex­press Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The event, held at the Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ News Cen­tre au­di­to­rium, was live-streamed on­line to a few hun­dred par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng spelt out a num­ber of chal­lenges Sin­ga­pore has to con­front in the wake of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>While its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) is pro­jected to grow by 4 per cent to 6 per cent next year, growth rates will re­main be­low 2019 lev­els by the end of next year, as the pro­jected con­trac­tion in the econ­omy of be­tween 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent this year means the econ­omy will start off from a lower base.</p>
    <p>“It is go­ing to be still quite a stress­ful pe­riod, so we would have to deal with that,” Mr Heng told his fel­low pan­el­lists, DHL Ex­press Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing direc­tor Christo­pher Ong and Busi­ness Times edi­tor Wong Wei Kong.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also fac­ing greater geopo­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty, he said.</p>
    <p>While US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den will hope­fully shape a new course for the world, the “fun­da­men­tal un­cer­tain­ties” that have been ar­tic­u­lated in the era of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s lead­er­ship are un­likely to go away.</p>
    <p>“Both the Democrats and Repub­li­cans will have sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ences to deal with, and around the world, there will also be sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ences to deal with,” he said, adding that Covid-19 has made the man­age­ment of such ide­o­log­i­cal dif­fer­ences far more dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Still, he hopes global lead­ers will ap­pre­ci­ate that peo­ple are now liv­ing in an in­ter-con­nected and in­ter­de­pen­dent world where many is­sues re­quire global co­op­er­a­tion, like the need to en­sure se­cure sup­ply chains dur­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Asked by par­tic­i­pants about Sin­ga­pore’s strat­egy amid the US-China trade war, Mr Heng said it re­mains the same: Be friends with all na­tions and con­tinue to be a strong sup­porter of mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is too small to threaten any­body... stick­ing to global rules and norms is very im­por­tant for us. If ev­ery­one (does it), and we are not forced to take sides, it will al­low us to ac­com­mo­date peo­ple and com­pa­nies from all over the world who want to use us as a base,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Asked by Mr Wong how Sin­ga­pore can man­age the ten­sion be­tween the de­mand for tal­ent as well as man­power and the de­sire for a stronger Sin­ga­porean core,</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said man­ag­ing the du­al­ity will al­ways be a part of the coun­try’s pol­icy frame­work. “I’ll say that it is not con­tra­dic­tory,” he added.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, grow­ing up in a mul­ti­cul­tural and mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety will give Sin­ga­pore­ans an edge, equip­ping them with a greater sen­si­tiv­ity to the cul­tures of dif­fer­ent peo­ple. This will en­able them to adapt and do busi­ness with peo­ple around the world.</p>
    <p>Also, if Sin­ga­pore­ans re­main open to hav­ing some of the world’s best tal­ents here, they will ben­e­fit from the process of os­mo­sis when work­ing with them, he added.</p>
    <p>At the awards, Mr For­rest Li, founder and group chief ex­ec­u­tive</p>
    <p>of tech gi­ant Sea, was named Busi­ness­man of the Year 2019/2020.</p>
    <p>The nat­u­ralised Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen, who is from Tian­jin in China, paid trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore’s role in Sea’s suc­cess, re­call­ing that he was deep in debt when he ar­rived here 15 years ago.</p>
    <p>“There is a stereo­type out there that busi­ness­men come to places like Sin­ga­pore only af­ter they have found suc­cess else­where.</p>
    <p>“That is not my story... Long be­fore I had any suc­cess, (the Sin­ga­porean com­mu­nity) made me feel wel­come, and let me and my fam­ily make our home here,” he said.</p>
