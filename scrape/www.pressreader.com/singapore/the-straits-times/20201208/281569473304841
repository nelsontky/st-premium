    <p>The World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) will be held in Sin­ga­pore in­stead of Switzer­land next year, as the Covid-19 pan­demic will make it dif­fi­cult to en­sure the health and safety of par­tic­i­pants in Europe, WEF pres­i­dent Borge Brende (above) said in an e-mail yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will host the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s (WEF) an­nual meet­ing next May, which will see top po­lit­i­cal, business and aca­demic lead­ers gather to dis­cuss press­ing global is­sues.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing its de­ci­sion to shift the an­nual fo­rum from Switzer­land in view of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Europe, the WEF said last night that the meet­ing in Sin­ga­pore “will be the first global lead­er­ship event to ad­dress world­wide re­cov­ery from the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>The WEF said it de­cided Sin­ga­pore was best placed to host the meet­ing in the light of the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion world­wide.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) said yes­ter­day that the WEF’s de­ci­sion re­flects its con­fi­dence in the coun­try’s man­age­ment of the Covid-19 pan­demic and will also boost the Re­pub­lic’s meet­ings and con­fer­ences sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore had two com­mu­nity cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>Said WEF founder and executive chair­man Klaus Sch­wab: “A global lead­er­ship sum­mit is of cru­cial im­por­tance to ad­dress how we can re­cover to­gether.</p>
    <p>“The Spe­cial An­nual Meet­ing 2021 will be a place for lead­ers from business, gov­ern­ment and civil so­ci­ety to meet in per­son for the first time since the start of the global pan­demic. Pub­lic-pri­vate co­op­er­a­tion is needed more than ever to re­build trust and ad­dress the fault lines that emerged in 2020.”</p>
    <p>Host­ing the WEF will give a boost to Sin­ga­pore’s meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) sec­tor and other sec­tors like hos­pi­tal­ity, said MTI.</p>
    <p>The an­nual fo­rum saw about 3,000 par­tic­i­pants gather in Davos in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>It will be held from May 13 to 16 next year, be­fore re­turn­ing to Davos, Switzer­land, in 2022.</p>
    <p>The an­nual fo­rum will – in a first – in­clude a vir­tual com­po­nent to al­low greater par­tic­i­pa­tion amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, said MTI.</p>
    <p>This is only the sec­ond time the WEF meet­ing will be held out­side of Switzer­land since it be­gan in 1971, and the first time it will be held in Asia. The 2002 edi­tion was held in New York, to show sol­i­dar­ity with the United States and the peo­ple of the city af­ter the Sept 11 ter­ror at­tacks the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the usual “Davos week” next year, the fo­rum will hold a vir­tual event from Jan 25 to 29. It will also host a global tech­nol­ogy gov­er­nance sum­mit in Tokyo in April, said the WEF.</p>
    <p>The MTI stressed that the health and safety of the lo­cal com­mu­nity and event at­ten­dees will be its “fore­most pri­or­ity”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has suc­cess­fully rolled out new pro­to­cols at large-scale meet­ings and con­fer­ences like the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week, it noted. Th­ese pro­to­cols in­clude on-ar­rival tests, pre-event and pe­ri­odic anti­gen test­ing, as well as con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>“All in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ences held in Sin­ga­pore will sim­i­larly ad­here to strict pub­lic health and safety mea­sures,” MTI said.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post last night, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said the WEF’s de­ci­sion “speaks vol­umes of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity’s trust and con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore’s han­dling of the pan­demic thus far”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore looks for­ward to sup­port­ing the WEF in its ef­forts to ef­fect pos­i­tive change glob­ally via di­a­logue and en­gage­ment, he added.</p>
    <p>“May we be a pos­i­tive ex­am­ple of how to re­sume eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties safely and sus­tain­ably,” Mr Chan said. “Suc­cess­ful ex­e­cu­tion of such high-level meet­ings will help re-es­tab­lish our­selves as a premier global business hub.”</p>
