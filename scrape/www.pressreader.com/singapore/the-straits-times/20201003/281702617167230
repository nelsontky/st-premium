    <p>As news of United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis reached Bei­jing, Chi­nese ne­ti­zens and state me­dia re­acted with a pal­pa­ble sense of schaden­freude.</p>
    <p>Their re­ac­tions in­di­cate the level of un­hap­pi­ness among the Chi­nese over what they see as Mr Trump’s un­fair and un­rea­son­able pres­sure on China over the past few months.</p>
    <p>Other Chi­nese ob­servers and state me­dia say Mr Trump’s and First Lady Me­la­nia Trump’s pos­i­tive di­ag­noses show just how wide­spread and se­vere the virus sit­u­a­tion is in the US.</p>
    <p>State news out­let China Daily pointed out that Mr Trump’s in­fec­tion was a “re­minder that the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ues to spread” de­spite his at­tempts to down­play the dan­ger this vi­ral pan­demic presents.</p>
    <p>“Since it emerged ear­lier this year, Trump, the White House and his cam­paign have down­played the threat and re­fused to abide by ba­sic pub­lic health guide­lines – in­clud­ing those is­sued by his own ad­min­is­tra­tion – such as wear­ing masks in pub­lic and prac­tis­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing,” said the news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Trump posted on Twit­ter that he and the First Lady had tested pos­i­tive for the virus, af­ter a top aide’s Covid-19 in­fec­tion had been con­firmed.</p>
    <p>The tweet was widely re­ported by Chi­nese state me­dia, and the hash­tag “Trump cou­ple tests pos­i­tive for Covid-19” be­came the top trend­ing topic on mi­cro-blog­ging site Weibo, with more than 1.2 bil­lion views as at 6pm yes­ter­day in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Many Chi­nese ne­ti­zens took the chance to poke fun at the US leader’s mis­for­tune.</p>
    <p>Com­ments like “Trump will prob­a­bly say no one un­der­stands Covid-19 more than me” and “See what hap­pens when you don’t wear a mask” were com­mon on many threads. Oth­ers thanked the US Pres­i­dent for giv­ing China this “Na­tional Day gift”.</p>
    <p>As the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion draws closer, Mr Trump has been ex­ert­ing in­creas­ing pres­sure on Bei­jing and Chi­nese firms.</p>
    <p>His ad­min­is­tra­tion has threat­ened to ban pop­u­lar Chi­nese-made apps WeChat and TikTok, can­celled the visas of Chi­nese stu­dents and re­searchers over es­pi­onage con­cerns and crit­i­cised China’s han­dling of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The moves have al­lowed Bei­jing to stoke feel­ings of na­tion­al­ism among its peo­ple as they point to China’s own suc­cess in curb­ing the spread of Covid-19 within its bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s di­ag­no­sis comes just a day af­ter the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China cel­e­brated its 71st an­niver­sary. It marked the start of an eight-day hol­i­day and a travel rush within the coun­try, just as coun­tries abroad were con­tem­plat­ing fur­ther lock­downs and travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Hu Xi­jin, the editor-in-chief of na­tion­al­ist tabloid Global Times, wrote on Weibo that Mr Trump’s Covid-19 in­fec­tion showed the sever­ity of the out­break within the US, and said this would likely af­fect his re-elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The US has recorded over 7.3 mil­lion Covid-19 cases and suf­fered more than 200,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and the First Fam­ily have now “paid the price” for the way the pan­demic was han­dled in the US, wrote Mr Hu.</p>
    <p>In a more diplo­matic tone, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing tweeted: “Sad­dened to learn #Pres­i­dent and the #FirstLady of the #US tested pos­i­tive. Hope they both have a speedy re­cov­ery and will be fine.”</p>
