    <p>Mid­way through my lunch with Lawrence Wong, I feel a sneeze com­ing. The air-con has been blow­ing on my back and my nose is, sud­denly and omi­nously, tin­gling. We’ve both taken off our face masks and are dis­sect­ing our main course of poached sea bass.</p>
    <p>Sneez­ing dur­ing a meal is not the done thing in th­ese Covid-19 times. Sneez­ing over the food of the co-chair­man of Sin­ga­pore’s multi-min­istry task force fight­ing the pan­demic? I don’t want to go there.</p>
    <p>I swal­low. Sip wa­ter. Push a fin­ger against the side of my nose and, luck­ily, the mo­ment passes. He is spared my aerosol spray.</p>
    <p>This is my first in-per­son lunch in­ter­view since Sin­ga­pore de­clared war on the pan­demic in Jan­uary. With fewer new cases, it seemed the right time to re­sume the se­ries and the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter has agreed to be my guest.</p>
    <p>He’s cho­sen Chez West, an el­e­gant train­ing restau­rant at ITE Col­lege West in Choa Chu Kang. Our French dishes will be pre­pared and served by culi­nary stu­dents.</p>
    <p>We wave hello when we meet and as we set­tle down at our ta­ble – we’re the only guests – I won­der if I should take my mask off. But he keeps his on and so I do the same. We chat but sound muf­fled.</p>
    <p>A stu­dent, John, fills our glasses with wa­ter. The min­is­ter re­moves his mask to drink and I grate­fully fol­low suit.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong lis­tens en­cour­ag­ingly as John re­cites our set menu. We’ll start off with vichys­soise but in­stead of soup, it’ll be done as a foamy ball with caviar. Next will be tortellini, then sea bass rounded off with ba­nana mous­se­line.</p>
    <p>Wine? John asks, hope­fully. “Un­for­tu­nately, we won’t be hav­ing it to­day. Too early,” Mr Wong says. John looks dis­ap­pointed and we let him prac­tise de­scrib­ing the op­tions to us any­way.</p>
    <p>We’re meet­ing in mid-Oc­to­ber and Mr Wong is look­ing more rested than dur­ing the early days of the pan­demic when cases were shoot­ing through the roof.</p>
    <p>“You know, the say­ing, right?” he says when I ask him to de­scribe 2020 for him.</p>
    <p>“There are decades when noth­ing hap­pens and then there are weeks when decades hap­pen. So this year feels like one of those times when ev­ery­thing hap­pens. Like a life­time has passed.”</p>
    <p>It’s cer­tainly been an ex­haust­ing year for him.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, the other task force co-chair, he has been in the thick of man­ag­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Then, as Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance, he was in­volved in the un­prece­dented four Bud­get pack­ages of eco­nomic re­lief.</p>
    <p>There was also the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion where his Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC ward got a cred­itable 63.2 per cent of the vote. A Cabi­net reshuf­fle saw him move from the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment to Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry.</p>
    <p>And amid all this, his beloved 16-year-old golden re­triever died in July.</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old for­mer civil ser­vant has been in pol­i­tics since</p>
    <p>2011, steadily climb­ing up the min­is­te­rial ranks with­out at­tract­ing – or court­ing – much me­dia at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Given his low pro­file, some were sur­prised when he was named co-chair of the task force. But, thrust into the spot­light, he has come into his own.</p>
    <p>He and Mr Gan, 61, have been a calm and steady pres­ence at the many me­dia con­fer­ences they have held. While Mr Gan deals with the med­i­cal as­pects, Mr</p>
    <p>Wong fo­cuses on the nuts and bolts of man­ag­ing the pan­demic, in­clud­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>His an­swers have been clear and per­sua­sive and his man­ner un­ruf­fled. He doesn’t grate or get in the way of the mes­sage.</p>
    <p>He has a rep­u­ta­tion among civil ser­vants for be­ing a smart, se­ri­ous guy who gets the job done. A teary mo­ment in Par­lia­ment in March, while he was pay­ing trib­ute to front-lin­ers, hu­man­ised him.</p>
    <p>Some po­lit­i­cal pun­dits now say he could well be a con­tender for prime min­is­ter one day.</p>
    <p>In our two-hour-plus con­ver­sa­tion, he’s straight­for­ward and has a bit of a no-non­sense air. But when he talks about more re­laxed top­ics, the min­is­ter, whose In­sta­gram bio reads “book­worm, gui­tar player and dog lover”, shows a warmer side.</p>
    <p>MARINE PA­RADE BOY</p>
    <p>By his own ac­count, his was “just an or­di­nary fam­ily in Marine Pa­rade”.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther, who’s 85 and has de­men­tia, was born in Hainan, went to Malaysia as a boy then came here to work and had a sales job in Sime Darby. His Sin­ga­pore-born mother, 80, was a pri­mary school teacher.</p>
    <p>He has a brother, older by two years, who’s an aero­space en­gi­neer at DSO Lab­o­ra­to­ries. Both at­tended Haig Boys’ Pri­mary where their mother taught. She was a dis­ci­plinar­ian in school and at home.</p>
    <p>“I sup­pose that shaped me in a cer­tain way,” he says. “To have a strong sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity, of mak­ing sure that if I com­mit to some­thing, I do it well.”</p>
    <p>He en­joyed school where he was more book­ish than sporty. Week­ends were a happy rou­tine of “Saturday li­brary, Sun­day church”.</p>
    <p>He loved the old Marine Pa­rade li­brary where he would bor­row science fic­tion and gui­tar books. His Sun­days were spent at Be­dok Methodist Church where he was a youth leader.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Haig Boys’, he went to Tan­jong Ka­tong Secondary Tech­ni­cal School, or TK Tech.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, some peo­ple will ask me, strangely, ‘You know, why didn’t you go to other schools?’ I sup­pose the pre­sup­po­si­tion is that you did well enough, why didn’t you go to...,” he trails off.</p>
    <p>“RI?” I of­fer, re­fer­ring to the elite Raffles In­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>“Yah,” he laughs. “I get that. But why? It was very nat­u­ral to con­tinue my ed­u­ca­tion in a school that was near to home and where all my friends were, and I en­joyed my­self tremen­dously.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter Vic­to­ria Ju­nior Col­lege, he got a gov­ern­ment schol­ar­ship to uni­ver­sity. He chose the United States as it was home to his favourite mu­si­cians.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther had given him a gui­tar when he was eight and he speaks about mu­sic with real en­thu­si­asm. While school­mates had pic­tures of their favourite celebri­ties in their school files, he had a pic­ture of Eric Clap­ton’s gui­tar. He loves rock, blues and soul, and jazz singers like Nina Si­mone and Ella Fitzger­ald.</p>
    <p>At the Uni­ver­sity of Wis­con­sin-Madi­son where he did eco­nomics, he and his Amer­i­can room­mate went busk­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never had, you know, huge am­bi­tions as a child. I just went through the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, en­joy­ing the time with friends.”</p>
    <p>He sailed through his first two years in the US. Around his third year, he got a wake-up call.</p>
    <p>Some­one asked him to ex­plain Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic model and he re­alised that while he knew text­book stuff, he didn’t know much about Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I thought, wow, this can­not be, right? I’m go­ing to grad­u­ate in a sub­ject with­out a mastery of the sub­ject.” He be­gan read­ing any­thing he could get his hands on.</p>
    <p>When he re­turned, he was posted to the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try and did eco­nomic mod­el­ling. Work­ing with grad­u­ates of Bri­tish uni­ver­si­ties, he re­alised other gaps in his ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“I could run mod­els and spread­sheets that they couldn’t, but they had ex­po­sure to that wealth of lit­er­a­ture, phi­los­o­phy, po­lit­i­cal econ­omy, which I had not been ex­posed to as a stu­dent.” Again, he caught up by read­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who was divorced with no chil­dren, spent 14 years in the pub­lic ser­vice, in­clud­ing as CEO of the En­ergy Mar­ket Author­ity. He has since re­mar­ried and his wife is in the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>POL­ICY WONK</p>
    <p>Early in his ca­reer, he had of­fers from the pri­vate sec­tor which he turned down.</p>
    <p>He liked how the civil ser­vice al­lowed him to do dif­fer­ent projects and shape schemes that could help Sin­ga­pore­ans. He found it mean­ing­ful go­ing down to the ground to ex­plain th­ese poli­cies.</p>
    <p>I tell him he has a rep­u­ta­tion for be­ing a pol­icy wonk. “Ap­par­ently,” he says with a shrug. “I don’t know how that hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>Why do you think peo­ple say that?</p>
    <p>“I don’t know,” he says, not</p>
    <p>will­ing to be drawn into this.</p>
    <p>I say I’ve heard he’s very on top of his sub­jects and can’t be smoked.</p>
    <p>He smiles but doesn’t re­ply. Chang­ing tack, I ask how he took on the Covid-19 chal­lenge. Did he, say, read a lot?</p>
    <p>“Well, like I said, right, it’s partly what I was brought up with,” he re­lents. “That when you do any­thing, you have to put ev­ery­thing into it, you have to re­ally want to ex­cel.”</p>
    <p>He elab­o­rates: “I sup­pose in the</p>
    <p>Methodist tra­di­tion, you would say your work is your wor­ship, right? You don’t delink faith from day to day. What­ever you do on a day-to-day ba­sis, if you do it well, if you take re­spon­si­bil­ity, that in it­self is a tes­ti­mony of how you as a per­son are an ex­am­ple, you know, a light for the world.”</p>
    <p>He was also shaped by men­tors like for­mer top civil ser­vant Lim Siong Guan, who would re­late what it was like to work for</p>
    <p>Old Guard leader Goh Keng Swee.</p>
    <p>“Siong Guan would say Dr Goh’s phi­los­o­phy was if Mr Lee (Kuan Yew) were to call him with any ques­tion, and if he doesn’t know the an­swer to that ques­tion, it’s an in­di­ca­tion that he has not done his work well be­cause he’s not on top of the is­sues.</p>
    <p>“And even if he doesn’t know im­me­di­ately, he has to know within a few hours, right, and he will make a point to try and mas­ter the is­sue and stay on top of it. I think that’s a very in­spir­ing ex­am­ple.”</p>
    <p>As Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter, a pri­or­ity will be to broaden the con­cept of merit be­yond aca­demics. Covid-19 has been a good re­minder of “the way we value con­tri­bu­tions from all sec­tors to our so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>I ask if Sin­ga­pore’s lead­er­ship tran­si­tion to the fourth gen­er­a­tion (4G) will be af­fected if the</p>
    <p>There are decades when noth­ing hap­pens and then there are weeks when decades hap­pen. So this year feels like one of those times when ev­ery­thing hap­pens. Like a life­time has passed.</p>
    <p>MR WONG, on 2020. Be­sides man­ag­ing Covid-19, he was in­volved in four Bud­get pack­ages of eco­nomic re­lief, and there was also the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>What­ever you do on a day-to-day ba­sis, if you do it well, if you take re­spon­si­bil­ity, that in it­self is a tes­ti­mony of how you as a per­son are an ex­am­ple, you know, a light for the world.</p>
    <p>MR WONG, on his rep­u­ta­tion for be­ing a pol­icy wonk and how he took on the Covid-19 chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>pan­demic drags on. His an­swer is not un­ex­pected. The pri­or­ity is to over­come the cri­sis. “At some stage, there’ll be a time to talk about lead­er­ship tran­si­tion. But let’s get over this hump first.”</p>
    <p>Has the thought oc­curred that we might be over­re­act­ing to Covid-19?</p>
    <p>“No­body said that at the start,” he coun­ters. “Ev­ery­body was telling us to do more ag­gres­sive mea­sures and we were telling every­one, yes, but let’s look at the science, let’s look at the ev­i­dence, and let’s un­der­stand that we are in it for the long haul. Now, the ques­tion is the op­po­site, that, oh, maybe you’re over­re­act­ing.”</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edges that Covid-19 fa­tigue is real and the eco­nomic im­pact very se­ri­ous, which is why the task force looks care­fully at data to see what re­stric­tions can be lifted, even as safe dis­tanc­ing, test­ing and trac­ing con­tinue.</p>
    <p>As we wrap up, I ask what he thinks the world will be like this time next year.</p>
    <p>There is a good chance there will be a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine by then, he says. “But how much of it is avail­able, and whether or not we can dis­trib­ute it to many peo­ple in the world, I doubt very much that would be pos­si­ble by next year, which means that the world will still not be safe from Covid.”</p>
    <p>He adds this de­press­ing news: “That means Sin­ga­pore will still be vul­ner­a­ble. And it also means that I doubt in­ter­na­tional travel will re­sume back to pre-Covid-19 lev­els by this time next year.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore he goes off to thank the culi­nary stu­dents (ser­vice has been earnest and the vichys­soise es­pe­cially de­li­cious), I ask how Covid-19 has changed him, as a per­son and politi­cian.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sure that it has changed me per­son­ally. But I would say it has given me re­newed con­fi­dence and hope about Sin­ga­pore,” he says.</p>
    <p>Amid the noise and com­plaints, one sees the best of Sin­ga­pore­ans shin­ing through dur­ing this pe­riod, he says. “It gives me a lot of hope and faith that we as a na­tion can rally to­gether and can do well for the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>This might sound like what a politi­cian would say, but com­ing from some­one who has spent the last nine months down in the trenches fight­ing the hor­ror that is the pan­demic, you be­lieve he re­ally means it.</p>
