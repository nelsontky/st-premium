    <p>With barely a week to go be­fore the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, mar­kets are al­ready fever­ishly po­si­tion­ing them­selves for the out­come.</p>
    <p>If the polls are to be trusted – a big if, given how far off the mark po­lit­i­cal polls have been over the past five years – a Joe Bi­den vic­tory is the most likely. Most polls give the for­mer US vice-pres­i­dent a six to 10 point lead over Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>As Mr Chris Rup­key, chief fi­nan­cial econ­o­mist at MUFG Union Bank, put it, with al­most 8 per cent un­em­ploy­ment and the worst econ­omy for any pres­i­dent fac­ing re-elec­tion in his­tory, it will be tough for the in­cum­bent to pull off a win.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Mr Jimmy Carter went into the 1980 elec­tion with 7.5 per cent un­em­ploy­ment and lost to chal­lenger Ron­ald Rea­gan. And in 1992, then Pres­i­dent Ge­orge H.W. Bush faced off against Demo­cratic can­di­date Bill Clin­ton amid 7.6 per cent un­em­ploy­ment. The rest is his­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Nigel Green, chief ex­ec­u­tive of deVere Group, one of the world’s largest in­de­pen­dent fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory and fin­tech or­gan­i­sa­tions, reck­ons the mar­ket is al­ready start­ing to price in a Bi­den win.</p>
    <p>“This has been ev­i­denced by in­vestors pil­ing into re­new­ables, in­dus­tri­als and other sec­tors that could ben­e­fit from Joe Bi­den sweep­ing into power on a ‘blue wave’ vic­tory,” he noted af­ter the sec­ond pres­i­den­tial de­bate last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Given that Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den have di­ver­gent eco­nomic and so­cial poli­cies, mar­ket re­ac­tion can vary, depend­ing on who wins.</p>
    <p>As UBS noted, Mr Trump’s sur­prise vic­tory in 2016 trig­gered the so-called “Trump trade” across fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Stocks and risky credit ral­lied, in­ter­est rates rose and the US dol­lar ini­tially strength­ened as in­vestors rushed to price in a com­bi­na­tion of lower taxes, looser reg­u­la­tion and higher fis­cal spend­ing. A sec­ond Trump term could see a con­tin­u­a­tion of these.</p>
    <p>“In a sec­ond term, we be­lieve Pres­i­dent Trump would fo­cus on dereg­u­la­tion, an Amer­ica First ap­proach to in­ter­na­tional trade, and tax re­duc­tions (which may con­sist of mak­ing per­ma­nent and per­haps ex­pand­ing the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act),” UBS noted.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond Trump term is also likely to see in­creased de­fence and space spend­ing, as well as re­duced reg­u­la­tions for banks and fin­tech and Big Tech com­pa­nies. Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion poli­cies could also be more ac­com­moda­tive of Wall Street and cor­po­rate Amer­ica in gen­eral.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal reg­u­la­tions could also be more lax, with the oil in­dus­try be­ing a ben­e­fi­ciary.</p>
    <p>While Mr Trump has not been ex­plicit in his pol­icy pri­or­i­ties, Mr Bi­den has been clear that his poli­cies would favour higher so­cial spend­ing, in­clud­ing on health­care and in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion is likely to also sig­nif­i­cantly in­crease spend­ing on cli­mate change mit­i­ga­tion. This would mean more in­cen­tives for re­new­able and green en­ergy ini­tia­tives, and pos­si­bly dis­in­cen­tives for the tra­di­tional fos­sil fuel sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Em­pha­sis is also likely to be on tech­nol­ogy en­hance­ment projects and start-ups, in­clud­ing roll-outs of 5G net­works and in­creased bio­med­i­cal re­search spend­ing.</p>
    <p>While a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion could be just as tough on China and other per­ceived trade ri­vals, it could take a more mul­ti­lat­eral and glob­al­ist ap­proach in tack­ling them.</p>
    <p>The need for more trans­port in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment is an­other is­sue on which both can­di­dates agree. But a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion is likely to fund these and other ini­tia­tives via higher taxes on cor­po­ra­tions and high-in­come earn­ers.</p>
    <p>Both can­di­dates will also be forced to pri­ori­tise poli­cies pro­mot­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery and job growth, given that the un­em­ploy­ment rate will likely rise to 9 per cent by early next year.</p>
    <p>TAX, STIM­U­LUS OUT­COMES</p>
    <p>Still, given that the mar­ket is pric­ing in a Bi­den vic­tory, it might be worth ex­am­in­ing the im­pact of Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion poli­cies on the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Key among these is tax.</p>
    <p>UBS cal­cu­lates that if the cor­po­rate tax rate rises from 21 per cent to 28 per cent, it would re­duce S&P 500 earn­ings per share by about 5 per cent. It also projects that higher taxes on in­come, cap­i­tal gains and div­i­dends for the wealthy could dampen “an­i­mal spir­its”.</p>
    <p>In short, the mar­kets could see an ini­tial sell­down on a Bi­den win.</p>
    <p>“Vir­tu­ally all com­pa­nies will face the prospect of higher cor­po­rate taxes. But bear in mind that tax in­creases could be phased in over time and higher gov­ern­ment spend­ing may ex­ceed the level of tax in­creases,” UBS noted.</p>
    <p>While reg­u­la­tory stan­dards could be tight­ened at a sec­tor level, there will be ben­e­fi­cia­ries in trans­port, green and tech in­fra­struc­ture spend­ing, UBS reck­oned. In con­trast, the oil and tra­di­tional en­ergy sec­tor could face strong reg­u­la­tory head­winds as the ad­min­is­tra­tion cuts sup­port and slaps dis­in­cen­tives on the use of fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>But the suc­cess that a US pres­i­dent has in rolling out poli­cies will also de­pend on who wins the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would be able to push through its agenda – in­clud­ing higher taxes, in­fra­struc­ture and health­care spend­ing and green ini­tia­tives – much more eas­ily with a Demo­cratic ma­jor­ity in the Se­nate. The al­ter­na­tive is long ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween the White House and law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>But the mar­ket seems to be pric­ing in a Bi­den win, sup­ported by a Demo­crat-con­trolled Se­nate.</p>
    <p>If this were to hap­pen, the econ­omy could also be buoyed by ex­tra stim­u­lus of up to</p>
    <p>US$3 tril­lion (S$4.1 tril­lion) sought by Democrats. The re­sult could be a broader-based eco­nomic re­cov­ery – rather than a nar­rower, tech-heavy one.</p>
    <p>As deVere Group’s Mr Green noted, “cycli­cal stocks are likely to out­per­form on the back of this fis­cal stim­u­lus and the in­fla­tion­ary ex­pec­ta­tions”.</p>
    <p>But Amer­ica is a very di­vided coun­try at the mo­ment, and a con­tested re­sult could in­ject tu­mult into the mar­kets in the af­ter­math of the elec­tion. If Mr Trump loses and then chal­lenges the out­come and re­fuses to con­cede, in­sta­bil­ity and chaos could up­set mar­kets for weeks.</p>
    <p>Brace your­self for such an out­come.</p>
    <p>Also, in­vestors must be re­al­is­tic about the re­turns that are achiev­able from here.</p>
    <p>Mar­kets have al­ready risen sharply since the sec­ond quar­ter and many stocks are trad­ing at rich val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den win could see a knee-jerk sell­down on Wall Street as in­vestors and cor­po­rates take stock of the im­pli­ca­tions of a left-of-cen­tre ad­min­is­tra­tion. But his­tor­i­cally, the US eq­uity mar­ket has found its feet quickly af­ter the first weeks of un­cer­tainty and gen­er­ally risen – al­beit in a volatile fash­ion – dur­ing the first year of a new US pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Asian mar­kets in gen­eral, and the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket in par­tic­u­lar, will take their cue from New York. So it may be worth­while to start mak­ing port­fo­lio ad­just­ment plans in the com­ing week.</p>
