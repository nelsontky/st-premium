    <p>The woman who was sued for defama­tion in a sep­a­rate case by a sur­geon lacked “good faith” when she ap­plied to have a com­pany sue its chief ex­ec­u­tive over its pur­chase of a fur­ther stake in the sur­geon’s pri­vate clinic.</p>
    <p>The High Court, in ex­plain­ing the rea­sons why it dis­missed Ms Serene Tiong’s ap­pli­ca­tion with costs, said she was “so mo­ti­vated by vendetta, per­ceived or real, that judg­ment will be clouded by purely per­sonal con­sid­er­a­tions”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tiong, the cen­tral fig­ure in the defama­tion suit brought by Dr Ju­lian Ong, had sought the court’s per­mis­sion to sue, on be­half of the com­pany HC Sur­gi­cal Spe­cial­ists (HCSS), its CEO Heah Sieu Min for al­leged breach of di­rec­tor’s du­ties re­lat­ing to the com­pany buy­ing an ad­di­tional 19 per cent stake in Dr Ong’s firm.</p>
    <p>Ms Tiong bought 100 shares in the Catal­ist-listed HCSS on Sept 25 last year – one day be­fore its an­nual gen­eral meet­ing – with a view to at­tend­ing the AGM and con­vey­ing con­cerns about the 19 per cent ac­qui­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Justice Chua Lee Ming, in de­ci­sion grounds is­sued last Mon­day, said Ms Tiong had ar­gued that she was the “most em­i­nently sen­si­ble per­son” to take the lead on the in­tended ac­tion against Dr Heah be­cause she was well ac­quainted with the facts at the ge­n­e­sis of the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“I dis­agreed,” said the judge. Ms Tiong’s claim had been that a for­mal in­ter­nal in­quiry which Dr Heah did not com­mence would have es­tab­lished that the al­le­ga­tions in her com­plaint to the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil against Dr Ong were true, and this would have im­pacted the com­pany’s de­ci­sion to ac­quire the 19 per cent share in Dr Ong’s com­pany.</p>
    <p>Her com­plaint in 2018 against Dr Ong al­leged that he and an­other med­i­cal spe­cial­ist had col­luded to have sex with vul­ner­a­ble women pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Dr Ong sued her in 2018 for defama­tion after she cir­cu­lated the com­plaint to other doc­tors. A district judge had ruled in favour of Ms Tiong, but Dr Ong ap­pealed to the High Court, which re­versed the rul­ing on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Tiong was re­quired un­der the Com­pa­nies Act to ob­tain court ap­proval to pur­sue the lat­est case.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Com­pa­nies Act, the court would have to be sat­is­fied, be­fore grant­ing per­mis­sion for her to pro­ceed, that she made the ap­pli­ca­tion in good faith and that it was in the com­pany’s in­ter­est to bring the ac­tion against Dr Heah.</p>
    <p>HCSS is a med­i­cal ser­vices group en­gaged mainly in pro­vid­ing en­do­scopic pro­ce­dures, in­clud­ing gas­tro­scopies and gen­eral surgery ser­vices, across a net­work of 18 clin­ics.</p>
    <p>Ms Tiong, through her lawyers Ong Ying Ping and Ken­neth Chua, al­leged that Dr Heah breached his du­ties to act with rea­son­able dili­gence, based on the Com­pa­nies Act.</p>
    <p>Among other things, she claimed that Dr Heah failed to re­cuse him­self from the de­ci­sion-mak­ing for the 19 per cent ac­qui­si­tion in Dr Ong’s com­pany.</p>
    <p>HCSS, rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Tan Chee Meng, Mr Paul Loy and Ms Janie Hui, and Dr Heah, de­fended by lawyers Chua Sui Tong and Gan Jhia Huei, con­tested the claims.</p>
    <p>In dis­miss­ing her claims with costs, Justice Chua said: “It seemed to me that the plaintiff’s real griev­ance was that she dis­agreed with the board’s as­sess­ment of the risks as­so­ci­ated with the com­plaint.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, the plaintiff’s view was that the com­pany should not have pro­ceeded with the 19 per cent ac­qui­si­tion, and/or should not have paid $3,795,000 for it.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, it is not for the plaintiff or in­deed, this court, to sec­ondguess cor­po­rate de­ci­sions that are made by those in charge of a com­pany who be­lieve in good faith that the de­ci­sions are in the best in­ter­ests of the com­pany.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tiong is ap­peal­ing against the judg­ment.</p>
