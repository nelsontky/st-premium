    <p>A ma­rine trades worker, who had not re­ceived proper train­ing, died af­ter he de­scended into a tube at Kep­pel Ship­yard’s premises in Benoi Road in 2014 and suf­fo­cated due to the pres­ence of ar­gon gas im­pair­ing the oxy­gen level there.</p>
    <p>Mr Peru­mal Azh­agu­raja, who worked for Alpine En­gi­neer­ing Ser­vices, had used a rope to de­scend into the tube, which was 90cm wide and 30m deep, to retrieve pieces of foam at around 11am on May 19 that year.</p>
    <p>One of his col­leagues, Mr Ren­ganathan Chan­drasekaran, who no­ticed that Mr Peru­mal had gone si­lent about five min­utes later, en­tered the tube to check.</p>
    <p>He found Mr Peru­mal un­con­scious at a depth of 22m.</p>
    <p>Both men were then pulled up. They were taken to the Na­tional University Hos­pi­tal, where Mr Peru­mal died at around 1pm.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren­ganathan did not sus­tain any in­juries.</p>
    <p>Alpine En­gi­neer­ing was fined $190,000 and Kep­pel Ship­yard was fined $70,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The firms had ear­lier pleaded guilty to an of­fence un­der the Work­place Safety and Health Act.</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Man­power prose­cu­tor Amos Tan stated in court doc­u­ments that Mr Peru­mal’s job du­ties in­cluded per­form­ing rope ac­cess works as well as grind­ing and paint­ing jobs within the ship­yard.</p>
    <p>Shortly be­fore the tragedy, his supervisor had asked him to re­move some pieces of foam from the tube.</p>
    <p>Mr Peru­mal did not carry a gas de­tec­tor when he en­tered the tube.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that some tubes in the area were ear­lier in­stalled us­ing tung­sten in­ert gas weld­ing, and tung­sten elec­trode was used to pro­duce the weld for the joints.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said: “In or­der to en­sure the fin­ish­ing of the joints was of the re­quired qual­ity, the weld­ing had to be car­ried out in an en­vi­ron­ment of ar­gon gas.</p>
    <p>“(Foam was) then in­stalled in the (tube) to cre­ate a gap where ar­gon gas would be pumped in to cre­ate an ar­gon gas en­vi­ron­ment for the weld­ing to be car­ried out.”</p>
    <p>The court heard that about 400 litres of ar­gon gas had been pumped into the space be­tween some pieces of foam in the tube to pre­pare for the weld­ing works be­fore the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>When Mr Peru­mal later en­tered the tube, the ar­gon gas dis­placed the oxy­gen around him, lead­ing to his as­phyx­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing, District J udge Adam Nakhoda called the breach of reg­u­la­tions by Alpine En­gi­neer­ing “sys­temic”.</p>
    <p>“It would be vi­tal for (Mr Peru­mal) to have a gas de­tec­tor and know how to use it. This is es­pe­cially so as ar­gon is both colour­less and odour­less,” said the judge.</p>
