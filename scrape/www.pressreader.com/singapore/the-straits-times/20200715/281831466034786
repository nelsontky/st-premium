    <p>LONDON • Face masks will be com­pul­sory in shops and su­per­mar­kets in Eng­land from next week, the gov­ern­ment said yes­ter­day in a U-turn on pre­vi­ous pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The new leg­is­la­tion will come into force in Eng­land on July 24, af­ter weeks of wran­gling from min­is­ters about the ef­fec­tive­ness of masks.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s of­fice said: “There is grow­ing ev­i­dence that wear­ing a face cov­er­ing in an en­closed space helps pro­tect in­di­vid­u­als and those around them from coro­n­avirus.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who fail to cover their face risk a fine of up to £100 (S$174).</p>
    <p>Mr John­son on Mon­day said the mea­sure was “ex­tra i nsurance” against the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>“I do think in shops it’s very im­por­tant to wear a face cov­er­ing if you’re go­ing to be in a con­fined space to pro­tect other peo­ple, and re­ceive pro­tec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Face masks have been manda­tory on pub­lic trans­port across the coun­try since June 15, and Scot­land has al­ready made the cov­er­ings com­pul­sory for shop­pers.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish En­vi­ron­ment Sec­re­tary Ge­orge Eus­tice said yes­ter­day that the gov­ern­ment was chang­ing its ad­vice in ac­cor­dance with de­vel­op­ments in sci­en­tific think­ing.</p>
    <p>“The ev­i­dence, the un­der­stand­ing, has been evolv­ing,” he told Sky News tele­vi­sion. “I don’t think it’s un­rea­son­able to ask the pub­lic now to go to that next step.”</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Matt Hancock was due to out­line the new pol­icy in Par­lia­ment later in the day.</p>
    <p>But there are al­ready con­cerns from the po­lice who have called it “nigh on en­force­able”.</p>
    <p>“Shop­keep­ers need to step up to the plate and take some re­spon­si­bil­ity,” said Mr Ken Marsh of the Metropoli­tan Po­lice Fed­er­a­tion, which rep­re­sents rank-and-file of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>“They can quite eas­ily put signs up on their doors – ‘No mask on, no en­try, this is pri­vate prop­erty’.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has seen al­most 45,000 deaths so far in the first wave – the high­est toll in Europe and third only to the United States and Brazil.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment was also warned yes­ter­day that a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions could see 120,000 deaths in hos­pi­tals alone in a “rea­son­able worst-case sce­nario” if no ac­tion was taken now.</p>
    <p>An Academy of Med­i­cal Sciences re­port, com­mis­sioned by the gov­ern­ment’s chief sci­en­tific ad­viser Pa­trick Val­lance, said the gov­ern­ment needed to pre­pare im­me­di­ately to pre­vent the state-run Na­tional Health Ser­vice from be­ing over­whelmed from Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>With hos­pi­tals also bat­tling sea­sonal flu cases, a sec­ond wave could eclipse the cur­rent out­break, re­sult­ing in up to 120,000 deaths be­tween Septem­ber and June next year, ac­cord­ing to the study.</p>
    <p>The mod­el­ling does not in­clude deaths in care homes or the wider com­mu­nity, and as­sumes no gov­ern­ment ac­tion to pre­vent a fresh surge in cases.</p>
    <p>The lat­est pre­dic­tions are based on an as­sump­tion that the R rate – which mea­sures how many peo­ple an in­fected per­son is ex­pected to in­fect – rises to 1.7 from Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The R rate is cur­rently be­tween 0.7 and 0.9 across the whole coun­try, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est gov­ern­ment fig­ure pub­lished last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Stephen Hol­gate, who led the study, said the 120,000 fig­ure was “not a pre­dic­tion but it is a pos­si­bil­ity”. “The mod­el­ling sug­gests that deaths could be higher with a new wave of Covid-19 this win­ter, but the risk of this hap­pen­ing could be re­duced if we take ac­tion im­me­di­ately.”</p>
    <p>The re­port calls for “in­tense prepa­ra­tion” this month and next to min­imise com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion, a pub­lic in­for­ma­tion cam­paign and en­sur­ing enough pro­tec­tive equip­ment for front-line med­i­cal and so­cial care staff.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s test, trace and iso­late pro­gramme also had to be scaled up, along with sur­veil­lance and en­sur­ing at-risk in­di­vid­u­als, and health­care and care work­ers get flu jabs.</p>
    <p>Stay-at-home re­stric­tions in Bri­tain are now be­ing eased in a bid to kick-start the coun­try’s stalled econ­omy but there re­mains con­cern about ris­ing num­bers of cases in some ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son said last Fri­day he was in favour of lo­calised re­sponses to out­breaks rather than again hav­ing to or­der the whole coun­try to be shut down.</p>
