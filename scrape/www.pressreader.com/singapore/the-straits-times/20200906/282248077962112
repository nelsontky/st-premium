    <p>If you want a com­fort­able, fuss-free stay on the doorstep of Kam­pong Glam, you could do worse than spend the night at The Sul­tan ho­tel – an el­e­gant row of con­served shop­houses in Jalan Sul­tan.</p>
    <p>The Sul­tan Room ($160), where I stay for a night, is not as ma­jes­tic as its name sug­gests. But it has a pleas­ant, classy decor and feels spa­cious, thanks to the high ceil­ing.</p>
    <p>A whiff of dis­in­fec­tant re­minds me of a den­tist’s clinic, but I am com­forted by the knowl­edge that the room is prob­a­bly as “squeaky SG clean” as its web­site says it is.</p>
    <p>The room is start­ing to show signs of age, and could use a bet­ter view – the win­dow faces an air well. Nor is there a swim­ming pool. But I am not too both­ered by these, since I plan to spend most of my time ex­plor­ing the his­toric area.</p>
    <p>Kam­pong Glam on a Mon­day af­ter­noon, I dis­cover, is a sleepy place. School­girls file out of Al­sagoff Arab School. A man at Sar­van’s Car­pets mends a Per­sian car­pet with nee­dle and thread. Roost­ers take a jaunt down a back lane, un­der the watch­ful eye of a cat. Ev­ery few hours, the call to prayer from Sul­tan Mosque rings through the air.</p>
    <p>I stum­ble into The Her­itage Shop, which is crammed with cu­rios and bric-a-brac, from tif­fin car­ri­ers to vin­tage ice ka­cang ma­chines. Also worth check­ing out are the Coda Cul­ture art space and The Gallery by Clay Jour­ney, where, if you are lucky, ce­ramic artist Steven Low will let you play the drums with him.</p>
    <p>Strolling past the his­toric shop­houses of Kam­pong Glam, I am re­minded of its his­tory as a hub of Malay and Is­lamic cul­ture. At the same time, I no­tice the gen­tri­fi­ca­tion and feel a sense of loss – gone are the old pon­doks (com­mu­nal lodg­ing houses), crafts­men and black­smiths. Ge­dung Kun­ing, the yel­low man­sion that once housed a prince, is now an in­ter­ac­tive-game space.</p>
    <p>At night, Haji Lane is abuzz with the drink­ing crowd, and I wind up at the Ori­en­tal Elixir, a well-hid­den wa­ter­ing hole. When I step in, I am greeted by Filipino folk mu­sic and shelf upon shelf of jars with flavours as exotic as kan­ga­roo.</p>
    <p>Mar­ion, the chatty bar­tender, says he will con­coct some­thing based on my pref­er­ences (there is no drinks menu). I ask for some­thing “spiced, sub­tle and so­phis­ti­cated”, and when he hands me my</p>
    <p>drink ($25) – a mix of gins, thyme, turmeric, lemon­grass, wormwood and gin­seng, I am not dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>Back in my ho­tel room, I get ready for a good night’s sleep (the bath­room has a glass-en­closed rain shower and the wa­ter is warm).</p>
    <p>At around 7.50am, I am awak­ened by the door­bell – break­fast, 10 min­utes ahead of sched­ule. Due to Covid-19, guests or­der break­fast in ad­vance and have it de­liv­ered to their room at a time of their choos­ing. My meal con­sists of juice and fish por­ridge topped, to my de­light, with plenty of gin­ger and caramelise­d shal­lots.</p>
    <p>I ap­pre­ci­ate The Sul­tan’s un­der­stated de­sign, brisk ser­vice and the lobby build­ing’s his­tory as the for­mer site of Harmy Press and Al-Ah­ma­diah Press, but the star at­trac­tion is its lo­ca­tion. If you need a psy­cho­log­i­cal re­set but­ton, this might be just what you are look­ing for.</p>
    <p>• HOT TIP: Con­sider book­ing a Stan­dard Dou­ble Room, which en­ti­tles you to a free up­grade to a Sul­tan Room, or a free 6pm check-out.</p>
