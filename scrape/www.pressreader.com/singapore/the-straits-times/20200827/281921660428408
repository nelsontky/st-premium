    <p>KENOSHA (Wis­con­sin) • A third night of street protests over the po­lice shoot­ing of a black man erupted into gun vi­o­lence on Tues­day in Kenosha, in the US state of Wis­con­sin, killing two peo­ple and wound­ing one, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia videos showed chaotic scenes of peo­ple run­ning and scream­ing amid a vol­ley of gun­fire, and oth­ers tend­ing to gun­shot wounds. The blood­shed fol­lowed a night of skir­mishes that had ap­peared to turn calm af­ter po­lice fired tear gas and rub­ber bul­lets at pro­test­ers who de­fied a cur­few.</p>
    <p>The shoot­ing broke out shortly be­fore midnight, killing two peo­ple and wound­ing a third who was ex­pected to sur­vive, the Kenosha Po­lice De­part­ment said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Crowds chased a man run­ning down the street with a ri­fle af­ter they be­lieved he had shot an­other man. One pur­suer took a fly­ing kick at him af­ter he fell to the ground. An­other man tried to grab his weapon and ap­peared to be shot at close range, fall­ing to the ground.</p>
    <p>An­other video showed a man who ap­peared to be shot in the head as sev­eral peo­ple rushed to his aid, fran­ti­cally try­ing to tend to his wound and keep him alert.</p>
    <p>Yet an­other video showed a man with a se­vere arm wound sit­ting on the ground and be­ing aided by an armed man as po­lice ap­proached.</p>
    <p>Kenosha has been rocked by protests since Sun­day, when po­lice shot Mr Ja­cob Blake, 29, in the back at close range.</p>
    <p>Af­ter strug­gling with po­lice, Mr Blake broke free and walked away from them and around his car to the driver’s side, where he was shot af­ter open­ing the door, ac­cord­ing to a by­stander video that went vi­ral. Three of his young sons were in the car, wit­nesses said.</p>
    <p>Mr Blake was hit by four of the seven shots fired and left paral­ysed and “fight­ing for his life”, his fam­ily and lawyers said on Tues­day, hours be­fore the lat­est round of civil un­rest broke out in the lake­front town be­tween Mil­wau­kee and Chicago.</p>
    <p>Anti-racism pro­test­ers also clashed with po­lice in Port­land, Ore­gon, and Louisville, Ken­tucky, on Tues­day night, part of a wave of na­tional protests that have con­tin­ued since the May 25 death of a black man, Mr George Floyd, in Min­ne­ap­o­lis af­ter he was pinned to the street un­der the knee of a white po­lice of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The Kenosha protests have drawn self-styled mili­tias, pa­trolling the streets with ri­fles or stand­ing guard out­side busi­nesses to pro­tect them from loot­ers or ar­son­ists. “They’re like a vig­i­lante group,” Kenosha County Sher­iff David Beth told the Mil­wau­kee Jour­nal Sen­tinel, though he said he was un­sure if the man at the cen­tre of the out­burst was linked to such a group.</p>
    <p>Mr Devin Scott, 19, told the Chicago Tri­bune he was in a group chant­ing “Black Lives Mat­ter” when the gun­fire be­gan and that he tried un­suc­cess­fully to re­vive one of the vic­tims. “I was cradling him in my arms. I was try­ing to keep this kid alive and he wasn’t mov­ing or noth­ing. He was just lay­ing there,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know what to do and then this woman starts per­form­ing car­diopul­monary re­sus­ci­ta­tion. There was no pulse. I don’t think he made it.”</p>
