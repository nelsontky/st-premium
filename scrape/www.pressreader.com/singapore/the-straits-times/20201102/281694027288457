    <p>PRAGUE • Nearly half of Slo­vakia’s en­tire pop­u­la­tion took Covid-19 swabs on Satur­day, the first day of two-day na­tion­wide test­ing which the gov­ern­ment hopes will help re­verse a fast rise in in­fec­tions with­out a hard lock­down.</p>
    <p>The scheme, a first in a coun­try of com­pa­ra­ble size, is be­ing watched by other na­tions look­ing for ways to slow the virus spread and avoid over­whelm­ing their health sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Such mass test­ing has also taken place i n en­tire Chi­nese ci­ties. Smaller Euro­pean states such as Lux­em­bourg and Monaco have also an­nounced mass test­ing pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter Jaroslav Nad said yes­ter­day that 2.58 mil­lion Slo­vaks took the test on Satur­day, and 25,850 or 1 per cent tested pos­i­tive and must go im­me­di­ately into quar­an­tine for 10 days.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union coun­try has 5.5 mil­lion peo­ple and aims to test as many as pos­si­ble, ex­cept for chil­dren un­der 10.</p>
    <p>More than 40,000 medics and sup­port teams of sol­diers, po­lice, ad­min­is­tra­tive work­ers and vol­un­teers staffed around 5,000 sites to ad­min­is­ter the anti­gen swab tests, which give quick re­sults – some­times within min­utes.</p>
    <p>The test­ing was free and vol­un­tary, but any­one who is not able to pro­duce a neg­a­tive test cer­tifi­cate if stopped by po­lice could get a heavy fine.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, so­cially dis­tanced queues could be seen form­ing in the streets of the cap­i­tal Bratislava even be­fore the points opened at 0600 GMT.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Igor Ma­tovic apol­o­gised for put­ting pres­sure on peo­ple to take part, but said the re­quire­ment was jus­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>“Free­dom must go to­gether with re­spon­si­bil­ity towards those who... are the weak­est among us, on­col­ogy pa­tients, old peo­ple, peo­ple with other dis­eases,” he told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Slo­vakia suf­fered only thou­sands of cases in spring and sum­mer, af­ter swiftly im­pos­ing re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>But in­fec­tions have soared in the past weeks, rais­ing con­cern that the coun­try may fol­low neigh­bour­ing Czech Repub­lic, which has the high­est two-week death rate in Europe.</p>
    <p>The scheme has faced op­po­si­tion from some ex­perts, who doubted that it made sense as a one-off mea­sure, or pointed to the anti­gen tests used, which are less ac­cu­rate than the lab­o­ra­tory poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests and may thus re­turn more false neg­a­tive, but also false pos­i­tive, re­sults.</p>
    <p>The Slo­vak As­so­ci­a­tion of Gen­eral Prac­ti­tion­ers has crit­i­cised the gov­ern­ment’s plan, say­ing that it is ill-pre­pared.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion said the “mass con­cen­tra­tion of mil­lions of peo­ple” at test­ing sites “is at odds with the rec­om­men­da­tions of in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­perts to re­duce public con­tact and mo­bil­ity as much as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment plans a se­cond round of the test­ing this week­end to catch cases missed in the first round or those who got in­fected in the mean­time.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Slo­vakia re­ported 2,282 new cases through PCR tests, put­ting the to­tal at 59,946, with­out those iden­ti­fied in the na­tion­wide scheme, and 219 deaths to date.</p>
