    <p>The Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioN­Tech – and cur­rently used in Singapore – can be quickly mod­i­fied if the virus mu­tates to the ex­tent that the vac­cine is no longer ef­fec­tive against it, said BioN­Tech’s chief strat­egy of­fi­cer and manag­ing direc­tor Ryan Richard­son.</p>
    <p>At present, how­ever, a pre­lim­i­nary study has showed that the shot ap­pears to be ef­fec­tive against the more in­fec­tious coron­avirus strains that sur­faced in Bri­tain and South Africa.</p>
    <p>“The tech­nol­ogy is very well suited to quick mod­i­fi­ca­tions,” said Mr Richard­son, re­fer­ring to the mes­sen­ger RNA plat­form the vac­cine uses. “In a pe­riod of weeks, we would be able to pro­duce a new vac­cine vari­ant to po­ten­tially ad­dress a new strain,” he said in an in­ter­view with The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>BioN­Tech co-founder Ugur Sahin also told a news con­fer­ence last month that its vac­cine can be adapted in six weeks.</p>
    <p>Mu­ta­tions in the virus re­fer to ran­dom changes in its ge­netic se­quence. Th­ese changes can be in­tro­duced as the virus repli­cates – akin to how ty­po­graph­i­cal er­rors are in­tro­duced as a text is copied and pasted.</p>
    <p>Mes­sen­ger RNA vac­cines such as the ones de­vel­oped by Pfiz­erBioNTech and Moderna – another lead­ing vac­cine can­di­date – in­volve in­ject­ing snip­pets of the vi­ral ge­netic se­quence into the body to trig­ger an im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“In prin­ci­ple, the beauty of the mes­sen­ger tech­nol­ogy is that we can di­rectly start to en­gi­neer a vac­cine which com­pletely mim­ics this new mu­ta­tion – we could be able to pro­vide a new vac­cine within six weeks,” Dr Sahin said.</p>
    <p>Their as­sur­ances come as na­tions scram­ble to con­tain out­breaks of the more i nfec­tious strains of the coron­avirus which ap­peared i n South Africa and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a pre­lim­i­nary study by Pfizer and the Univer­sity of Texas Med­i­cal Branch pub­lished on pre­print site bioRxiv on Thurs­day, the vac­cine ap­pears to be ef­fec­tive against both.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard­son said dur­ing last week’s in­ter­view that there is a risk that fu­ture vari­ants could chal­lenge the ef­fec­tive­ness of the vac­cine, how­ever this is some­thing be­ing closely mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>“(Adapt­ing the vac­cine) is some­thing that over the longer term will be an im­por­tant part of stay­ing on top of Covid-19 and mak­ing sure that the mu­ta­tion does not take us back­wards,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 vac­cine by Pfiz­erBioNTech is the first and only vac­cine to be ap­proved for use in Singapore so far. The first ship­ment ar­rived here last month, mak­ing the Repub­lic the first na­tion in Asia to re­ceive the doses.</p>
    <p>Asked when other ship­ments of the vac­cine are due to ar­rive, Mr Richard­son said: “I can say con­fi­dently that we plan to send doses through­out 2021.”</p>
    <p>Doses will come in in­stal­ments world­wide, he said, adding that BioN­Tech and Pfizer are work­ing to ex­pand ca­pac­ity. “So I ex­pect that our sup­ply ca­pac­ity will con­tinue to ramp up through­out the first half of this year,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that even though Singapore is a small mar­ket in and of it­self, the com­pany sees the coun­try as an “im­por­tant part of a broader strate­gic re­gion... namely the neigh­bour­ing South-east Asia re­gion”.</p>
    <p>“We’re proud that we were the first com­pany to bring a vac­cine to Singapore. For us, Singapore is an im­por­tant re­gion and we plan to es­tab­lish a pres­ence in Singapore go­ing for­ward,” he said.</p>
