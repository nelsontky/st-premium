    <p>In at­tack, Spurs have scored 29 league goals. Kane and Son He­ung-min have 22 of those. In 13 cases, one has pro­vided the as­sist for the other.</p>
    <p>Even if they prove a record-break­ing dou­ble act, the re­liance on them nev­er­the­less looks dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Pep Guardi­ola ir­ri­tated Tot­ten­ham. It may have been meant as a com­pli­ment when he branded them “the Harry Kane team” but it sounded like he was say­ing they were a one-man team.</p>
    <p>Per­haps, how­ever, he was half-right.</p>
    <p>Now they are the Kane and Son side. Not de­fen­sively, where Jose Mour­inho’s com­mit­ment to the col­lec­tive has made them an ef­fec­tive unit.</p>
    <p>But in at­tack, Spurs have scored 29 league goals. Kane and Son He­ung-min have 22 of those .</p>
    <p>In 13 cases, one has pro­vided the as­sist for the other. Even if they prove a record-break­ing dou­ble act, the re­liance on them nev­er­the­less looks dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>Kane and Son have scored 76 per cent of Tot­ten­ham’s goals, a higher per­cent­age than any pair at any other club.</p>
    <p>Spurs’ next marks­man is Tan­guy Ndombele, whose two goals put him on course to fin­ish the sea­son with 4.75. And, apart from be­ing math­e­mat­i­cally im­pos­si­ble, that is a prob­lem. Be­cause, no mat­ter how po­tent the two main men are, ev­ery suc­cess­ful side re­quires a third scorer.</p>
    <p>Some­times he is a goal-scor­ing mid­fielder, some­times a winger, some­times a sub­sti­tute striker, but there is in­vari­ably some­one else chip­ping in.</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons of­fer a guide.</p>
    <p>With wingers Mo­hamed Salah and Sa­dio Mane lead­ing the way for Liver­pool’s in­verted for­ward line, Roberto Firmino was their third-high­est scorer last sea­son with nine.</p>
    <p>No one else got more than five, but even that was rare.</p>
    <p>In 2017-18, Manch­ester City had four play­ers in dou­ble fig­ures for league goals. David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne had nine and eight re­spec­tively. The fol­low­ing year, seven play­ers got at least six.</p>
    <p>Go back a gen­er­a­tion and Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer was Manch­ester United’s 12-goal third top scorer in 1998-99 when largely a sub­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>Even among sur­prise win­ners who de­pended on two men, Jamie</p>
    <p>Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, Le­ices­ter’s 2015-16 cham­pi­ons ben­e­fited from six each from Leonardo Ul­loa and Shinji Okazaki.</p>
    <p>And while Spurs’ ini­tial aim in­volves a re­turn to the Cham­pi­ons League, Chelsea fin­ished fourth last year with five play­ers get­ting at least seven; United were third with four on eight or more.</p>
    <p>Could a com­bi­na­tion of a fine de­fen­sive record and two Golden Boot con­tenders com­pen­sate for a lack of al­ter­na­tive scor­ers? His­tory sug­gests not. So does Mour­inho.</p>
    <p>Steven Berg­wijn is the third of the front three, a dili­gent de­fender and a man who has not scored in 27 ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>“We need him to score goals,” Mour­inho has said.</p>
    <p>Lu­cas Moura has been po­tent for him in the Europa League, but not the Premier League.</p>
    <p>Ob­vi­ously, the role of the third scorer seemed des­tined for Gareth Bale, but in­juries have rel­e­gated him to a bit-part role.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho has marginalis­ed Dele Alli, who got 22 in 2016-17. The much-im­proved Ndombele has never been pro­lific and Gio­vani lo Celso scored far more for Real Betis than Spurs.</p>
    <p>They are six can­di­dates for the role of the third scorer. In the­ory, Spurs have more fire­power than most.</p>
    <p>In prac­tice, and with Mour­inho’s safety-first tac­tics, they have only two fin­ish­ers.</p>
    <p>And bril­liant as Kane and Son are, that might not be enough to re­alise their am­bi­tions.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Tot&#xAD;ten&#xAD;ham&#x2019;s re&#xAD;liance on Harry Kane and Son He&#xAD;ung-min for goals is risky. Steven Berg&#xAD;wijn is the third of the front three, a dili&#xAD;gent de&#xAD;fender who has not scored in 27 ap&#xAD;pear&#xAD;ances.</p>
