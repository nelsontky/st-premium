    <p>The pub­lic feed­back is that the on­board unit (OBU) to be in­stalled in ve­hi­cles next year is too bulky, but Senior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Amy Khor said yes­ter­day the au­thor­i­ties will go ahead with the de­vice, even as they con­tinue to ex­plore how to make it bet­ter.</p>
    <p>One rea­son is that the Land Trans­port Authority (LTA) is con­trac­tu­ally bound to the OBU de­sign af­ter award­ing the ten­der in 2016, so it can­not make al­ter­ations with­out in­cur­ring ex­tra costs.</p>
    <p>LTA, how­ever, will of­fer ve­hi­cle own­ers a few op­tions to gather feed­back on, for in­stance, what is to be shown on the OBU touch­screen dis­play.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, the dis­play can be kept black most of the time, and dis­play ERP charges paid only when a trans­ac­tion is ef­fected,” she said in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“As a pos­si­ble fu­ture up­grade, LTA is also study­ing whether in­for­ma­tion from the OBU can be pushed to our smart­phones, which can then be used as the dis­play screen in­stead.”</p>
    <p>Dr Khor was re­spond­ing to MPs, in­clud­ing Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas) and Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat (Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC), who had in­di­cated the larger screen of the new OBU could be a dis­trac­tion to driv­ers and had asked whether it could be re­placed by smart­phones.</p>
    <p>The new OBU for cars, to be in­stalled from the sec­ond half of next year, com­prises an an­tenna, a touch­screen dis­play to be mounted near the wind­screen and a pro­cess­ing unit to be in­stalled un­der the dash­board.</p>
    <p>It will be com­pat­i­ble with the new Elec­tronic Road Pricing (ERP) sys­tem that will be switched on in the mid­dle of 2023, to re­place the ex­ist­ing ERP in­fras­truc­ture, which has been in op­er­a­tion for 22 years.</p>
    <p>Dr Khor said the cur­rent ERP sys­tem is get­ting in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult and ex­pen­sive to main­tain, and so “there is an ur­gency, a need to im­ple­ment the next-gen ERP” with­out in­tro­duc­ing fur­ther changes that could up­set the time­line.</p>
    <p>“So what we want is to en­sure a smooth in­stal­la­tion of the next-gen ERP and to do this, the dis­play unit will (first) be a stan­dard is­sue.</p>
    <p>“We also need time to work with the con­trac­tors and the con­sul­tants to come up with the pro­gramme to be able to push OBU spe­cific data to the mo­bile app.”</p>
    <p>In what was de­scribed as a “show-and-tell” by an MP, Dr Khor held up a model of to­day’s in-ve­hi­cle unit (IU) and the new OBU to show that the new unit is only marginally big­ger. The OBU dis­play unit is 15cm x 8cm x 2cm, while the IU is 12cm x 8cm x 3cm.</p>
    <p>There re­main con­cerns, how­ever, that the way the units are mounted on the wind­screen could af­fect driv­ers’ vis­i­bil­ity. Dr Khor said LTA is con­sult­ing work­shops and mo­tor ve­hi­cle agents to make sure block­age of the wind­screen is “very min­i­mal”, and that the OBU dis­play unit can be folded away.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) asked what the ten­der’s spec­i­fi­ca­tions were that led to “us be­ing bound by the de­sign that we com­mit­ted to four years ago, rather than al­low­ing for flex­i­bil­ity to up­date that as and when we went along”.</p>
    <p>She asked if fu­ture calls for ten­der should al­low for greater scope for pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion and de­sign tweaks, es­pe­cially as tech­nol­ogy moves very quickly these days.</p>
    <p>Dr Khor said she did not have de­tails of the con­tract, but that all con­tracts re­quire cer­tain spec­i­fi­ca­tions to be put up for con­trac­tors or ten­der­ers to have “some amount of cer­tainty”.</p>
    <p>“Within those lim­its... there is room for con­sul­ta­tion,” she added.</p>
    <p>She noted that the con­trac­tors of the OBU have them­selves done in­ter­nal con­sul­ta­tions. LTA has also en­gaged Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity to do a study on the dis­play fea­tures, as well as con­vened two in­de­pen­dent re­views on the unit’s se­cu­rity fea­tures.</p>
    <p>“It is a first-of-kind project. It’s an in­ter­na­tional ten­der, and there is no ref­er­ence point. So, we did take a bit of time,” she said.</p>
    <p>The first OBU will be given free for ex­ist­ing Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered ve­hi­cles and more de­tails on its in­stal­la­tion will be given later.</p>
