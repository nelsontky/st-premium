    <p>The ten­ders for two con­firmed-list res­i­den­tial sites un­der the gov­ern­ment land sales (GLS) pro­gramme for the first half of the year closed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The two 99-year lease­hold land parcels – in Tanah Merah Kechil Link and Yishun Av­enue 9 – of­fered for sale by the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity and the Hous­ing Board (HDB), re­spec­tively, are the first GLS ten­ders to close since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>A de­ci­sion on the award of the ten­ders will be made af­ter the bids for both sites have been eval­u­ated.</p>
    <p>Amid the re­ces­sion, the bids were gen­er­ally above ex­pec­ta­tions, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>The 8,880 sq m site in Tanah Merah Kechil Link, next to Tanah Merah MRT sta­tion, at­tracted 15 bids, with the high­est by MCC Land (Sin­ga­pore) at $248.99 mil­lion. This trans­lates to a land rate of about $930 per sq ft per plot ra­tio (psf ppr), an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>This rep­re­sents the high­est num­ber of bids since the Hol­land Road com­mer­cial and res­i­den­tial site ten­der in May 2018, which drew 15 bids from 10 con­sor­tiums, Colliers In­ter­na­tional’s head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore Tricia Song noted.</p>
    <p>It is also much higher than the four to nine bids seen for pri­vate res­i­den­tial gov­ern­ment land sale sites over the past 18 months, she said.</p>
    <p>The 21,514 sq m ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium (EC) site in Yishun Av­enue 9 drew the high­est bid from Sing Hold­ings at $373.5 mil­lion (or a land rate of $576 psf ppr), out of a to­tal of seven bids re­ceived by the HDB.</p>
    <p>Mr Karamjit Singh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Show­suite Con­sul­tancy, noted that both sites are tar­geted at the mass mar­ket, where the de­mand for homes re­mains the strong­est.</p>
    <p>“The top bid for the Tanah Merah site would re­quire the de­vel­oper to sell the new apart­ments for $1,700 psf to $1,800 psf, which is bullish as new units in that area are trad­ing be­tween $1,500 psf and $1,600 psf,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong Teck Hui, se­nior di­rec­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy at JLL, said the site’s key at­trac­tions are its prox­im­ity to Tanah Merah MRT sta­tion and its rel­a­tively small plot size, re­quir­ing less cap­i­tal out­lay.</p>
    <p>“The res­i­den­tial devel­op­ment at Tanah Merah Kechil Link is likely to be launched in late 2021 when buy­ing de­mand could im­prove along­side an ex­pected eco­nomic re­cov­ery,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Tanah Merah Kechil Link site, which is slated for res­i­den­tial with com­mer­cial use on the first storey, can po­ten­tially yield about 265 units and 2,000 sq m of com­mer­cial space.</p>
    <p>The pro­vi­sion for com­mer­cial space is at­trac­tive as nearby ameni­ties are limited, said Ms Wong Siew Ying, PropNex head of re­search and con­tent.</p>
    <p>The Yishun EC site was given an ex­tended pub­lic ten­der pe­riod of six months due to the pan­demic. Ten­der du­ra­tions for res­i­den­tial sites un­der the GLS pro­gramme are typ­i­cally six to eight weeks.</p>
    <p>The EC site could yield about 600 homes, and is near Junc­tion 9, a new mall.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak noted that the top bid for the Yishun EC site “shows that the de­vel­oper is quite con­fi­dent as the land rate is higher than the two EC sites launched for sale in 2019”.</p>
    <p>“At the land rate of $576 psf ppr, the es­ti­mated break-even cost is about $1,000 psf to $1,050 psf. The de­vel­oper prob­a­bly plans to launch new units at prices above $1,100 psf,” he added.</p>
    <p>Con­fi­dence could also have been boosted by steady sales at the Pier­mont Grand ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium – which is 76 per cent sold at me­dian prices of over $1,100 psf – as well as a lack of ECs in the lo­cal­ity over the past six years, Ms Song noted.</p>
    <p>The Yishun Av­enue 9 site is lo­cated at the edge of Yishun town, some 2km from Yishun MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is the new­est EC site in the lo­cal­ity to be of­fered on the GLS pro­gramme since 2014... so there could be some pent-up de­mand,” Ms Song said.</p>
