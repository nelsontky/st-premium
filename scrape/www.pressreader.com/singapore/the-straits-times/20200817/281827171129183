    <p>BEDMINSTER (New Jersey) • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has vowed to use a con­tro­ver­sial tech­nique to uni­lat­er­ally re­in­state United Na­tions sanc­tions on Teheran, a move with huge reper­cus­sions for the Iran nu­clear deal.</p>
    <p>His dec­la­ra­tion on Satur­day came after the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil over­whelm­ingly re­jected a US res­o­lu­tion to ex­tend an Ira­nian arms em­bargo.</p>
    <p>“We’ll be do­ing a snap­back,” said Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“You’ll be watch­ing week.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent was re­fer­ring to the con­tested ar­gu­ment that the United States re­mains a “par­tic­i­pant” in the 2015 Iran nu­clear deal – de­spite Mr Trump’s with­drawal from it – and the US can there­fore force a re­turn to sanc­tions if it sees Iran as be­ing in vi­o­la­tion of its terms.</p>
    <p>Iran’s Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani said the US had failed to kill off what he called the “half alive” deal it next with ma­jor pow­ers that gave Iran re­lief from sanc­tions in ex­change for curbs on its nu­clear pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“The US failed in this con­spir­acy with hu­mil­i­a­tion,” Mr Rouhani said. “This day will go down in the his­tory of our Iran and in the his­tory of fight­ing global ar­ro­gance.”</p>
    <p>Only two of the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil’s 15 mem­bers voted in favour of the US res­o­lu­tion seek­ing to ex­tend the em­bargo, high­light­ing the di­vi­sion be­tween Wash­ing­ton and its Euro­pean al­lies since Mr Trump with­drew from the nu­clear ac­cord in 2018.</p>
    <p>The Euro­peans on the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil all ab­stained, and Iran mocked the US for win­ning the sup­port of just one coun­try, the Do­mini­can Repub­lic, other than it­self.</p>
    <p>“In the 75 years of UN his­tory, Amer­ica has never been so iso­lated,” tweeted For­eign Min­istry spokesman Ab­bas Mousavi.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple on the streets of Teheran had mixed re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“This is an Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal game. One day they give a res­o­lu­tion to the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, the next they say they have taken” Ira­nian fuel, said a worker at the city’s Grand Bazaar, who gave his name only as Mr Ah­madi.</p>
    <p>A drug­store em­ployee, known only as Ms Ab­doli, said she was happy Iran won, but added that it “should in­ter­act with the US and es­tab­lish re­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean al­lies have been scep­ti­cal on whether Wash­ing­ton can force sanc­tions, with ex­perts say­ing a snap­back threat­ens to plunge the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil into one of its worst-ever diplo­matic crises.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo on Satur­day made clear the US would press on. “It is un­for­tu­nate that the French and the United King­dom... didn’t sup­port what the Gulf states have de­manded, what the Is­raelis have de­manded,” Mr Pom­peo said.</p>
    <p>“The United States is deter­mined to make sure that the Ira­ni­ans and this regime, this theo­cratic regime, does not have the ca­pac­ity to i nflict even more harm on the world.”</p>
    <p>Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu de­nounced the “scan­dalous” vote.</p>
    <p>He said: “Ira­nian ter­ror­ism and ag­gres­sion threaten the peace of the re­gion and the en­tire world. In­stead of op­pos­ing weapons sales, the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil is en­cour­ag­ing them.”</p>
    <p>The em­bargo on con­ven­tional arms ex­pires on Oct 18 un­der the terms of a res­o­lu­tion that blessed the Iran nu­clear deal, known as the Joint Com­pre­hen­sive Plan of Ac­tion (JCPOA).</p>
    <p>Since Mr Trump pulled out of it and slapped uni­lat­eral sanc­tions on Iran, Teheran has taken es­ca­la­tory steps away from com­pli­ance as it presses for sanc­tions re­lief.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s Euro­pean al­lies – who, along with Rus­sia and China, signed the deal with Iran – have voiced sup­port for ex­tend­ing the 13-year arms em­bargo, say­ing that an ex­piry threat­ens Mid­dle East sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>But their pri­or­ity is to pre­serve the JCPOA.</p>
    <p>The US text at the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil on Fri­day ef­fec­tively called for an in­def­i­nite ex­ten­sion of the em­bargo on Iran, which diplo­mats said would threaten the nu­clear deal.</p>
    <p>Iran said it has the right to self­de­fence and that a con­tin­u­a­tion of the ban would mean an end to the deal.</p>
    <p>Apart from 11 coun­tries ab­stain­ing from the vote, Rus­sia and China op­posed the res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“The re­sult shows again that uni­lat­er­al­ism en­joys no sup­port, and bul­ly­ing will fail,” China’s UN mis­sion tweeted.</p>
    <p>IRAN’S RE­AC­TION</p>
    <p>The US failed in this con­spir­acy with hu­mil­i­a­tion. This day will go down in the his­tory of our Iran and in the his­tory of ’’ fight­ing global ar­ro­gance. IRAN’S PRES­I­DENT HAS­SAN ROUHANI, on the US’ move to ex­tend the arms em­bargo. U.S. PO­SI­TION</p>
    <p>It is un­for­tu­nate that the French and the United King­dom... didn’t sup­port what the Gulf states have de­manded, what the Is­raelis have de­manded. The United States is deter­mined to make sure that the Ira­ni­ans and this regime, this theo­cratic regime, does not have the ca­pac­ity to in­flict even ’’ more harm on the world.</p>
