    <p>Se­niors here will be able to re­ceive ser­vices and take part in pro­grammes at 280 el­der­care cen­tres across the is­land from next year, when cur­rent cen­tres con­sol­i­date their ser­vices to cater to all el­derly peo­ple, re­gard­less of their in­come or frailty lev­els.</p>
    <p>The cen­tres will pro­vide a range of ser­vices, in­clud­ing ac­tive age­ing pro­grammes and be­friend­ing, as well as in­for­ma­tion on and re­fer­ral to care ser­vices, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>To­day, there are about 130 se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres cater­ing pri­mar­ily to res­i­dents of ren­tal flats and stu­dio apart­ments, and 150 se­nior care cen­tres and ac­tive age­ing hubs for se­niors who are more frail and re­quire ad­di­tional care ser­vices, such as day care or com­mu­nity re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The tran­si­tion to the new model will take place in phases be­tween May next year and 2024 to give the el­der­care cen­tres enough time to gather their re­sources and level up their ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>MOH said the el­der­care cen­tres will fur­ther the goals of help­ing se­niors to age healthily, get timely ac­cess to qual­ity care, stay con­nected to the com­mu­nity, and con­trib­ute as they wish. Se­niors will be able to take part in reg­u­lar pro­grammes in their com­mu­nity and vol­un­teer to help other se­niors.</p>
    <p>The el­der­care cen­tres will also en­gage se­niors to en­sure their needs are ad­dressed. Those with poorer so­cial sup­port, for in­stance, will re­ceive be­friend­ing ser­vices. Se­niors with higher care needs will be re­ferred to ap­pro­pri­ate care.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, Min­is­ter for</p>
    <p>So­cial and Family De­vel­op­ment and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Health, said: “Longer life ex­pectancy is a gift to cel­e­brate, and we can do more of the things we en­joy if we stay fit and healthy.</p>
    <p>“With the new base­line ser­vice model, se­niors will have more op­por­tu­ni­ties to stay ac­tive and take charge of their health. Se­niors and their care­givers will also be bet­ter able to nav­i­gate the so­cial and health sup­port avail­able.”</p>
