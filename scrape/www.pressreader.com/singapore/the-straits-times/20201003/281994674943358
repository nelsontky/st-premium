    <p>Oswald and his col­leagues have found ev­i­dence of a mid-life cri­sis in orang­utans and chim­panzees in zoos. (I know you’re cu­ri­ous: they asked the zookeep­ers to as­sess the psy­cho­log­i­cal well-be­ing of the great apes in ques­tion.) This sug­gests that there may be some­thing fun­da­men­tal hap­pen­ing. It also sug­gests there may be lit­tle we can do about it.</p>
    <p>Oswald thinks that it is worth sim­ply ac­knowl­edg­ing that the mid-life cri­sis is a ro­bust sta­tis­ti­cal phe­nom­e­non rather than the set-up for a punch­line about mo­tor­bikes. And he ar­gues that we need “a mid-life pol­icy of some kind”.</p>
    <p>Per­haps. Gen­er­a­tion X tends to fly un­der the radar in the cul­ture war be­tween boomers and mil­len­ni­als but we are the ones run­ning the world.</p>
    <p>Most of the Bri­tish Cab­i­net, for ex­am­ple, are Gen-X-ers like me. So you’d think that tak­ing care of 47-year-olds was some­thing they’d have sorted out, al­most by de­fault.</p>
    <p>Then again, you’d think they’d have sorted out a coro­n­avirus strat­egy and Brexit, too, but life is full of dis­ap­point­ments – par­tic­u­larly if you are about to hit 47.2.</p>
