    <p>Play­ing for a smaller school like Idaho, it’s good be­cause I’ll make a dif­fer­ence to the team and I’ll be given the chance to play against great play­ers from bet­ter schools.</p>
    <p>Ethan Lye has never vis­ited Idaho State Univer­sity’s (ISU) cam­pus or met its ten­nis coach Alexan­der Free. But through phone calls with him and videos of the univer­sity, the Sin­ga­porean felt a con­nec­tion that he be­lieves will help him achieve his dream of play­ing pro­fes­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old, seen as Sin­ga­pore’s bright­est tal­ent, has signed a Na­tional Let­ter of In­tent with ISU and is set to start a four-year de­gree in Au­gust or Septem­ber on a full schol­ar­ship. He plans to study psy­chol­ogy or sports phys­i­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The schol­ar­ship will cover tu­ition fees, ten­nis-re­lated ex­penses like coach­ing, equip­ment and ap­parel, and some of his ac­com­mo­da­tion costs. Ac­cord­ing to the univer­sity’s web­site, the cost of tu­ition fees, room, books and sup­plies amounts to about US$32,000 (S$42,390) for the 2020-21 school year.</p>
    <p>Lye, based in Syd­ney since 2014 un­til his re­turn in Jan­uary for na­tional ser­vice, said yes­ter­day: “The coach seemed re­ally in­ter­ested in de­vel­op­ing me into a good pro player and pre­par­ing me for the pro cir­cuit after col­lege, which re­ally in­trigued me.</p>
    <p>“He seemed like a gen­uine guy who’s fo­cused on de­vel­op­ing the team and in­di­vid­u­als to be­come bet­ter play­ers rather than just on win­ning ti­tles.</p>
    <p>“He’s new to the school but he’s not new to ten­nis and be­ing a coach. He’s also played col­lege ten­nis so he knows what it takes to be suc­cess­ful and brings in a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence, so I’m re­ally look­ing for­ward to work­ing with him.”</p>
    <p>ISU com­petes in the top-tier Di­vi­sion 1 of the Na­tional Col­le­giate Ath­letic As­so­ci­a­tion (NCAA) cham­pi­onships and its men’s ten­nis team also fea­ture in the NCAA Div 1-af­fil­i­ated Big Sky Con­fer­ence.</p>

    <p>IDEAL FO­CUS</p>
    <p>He seemed like a gen­uine guy who’s fo­cused on de­vel­op­ing the team and in­di­vid­u­als to be­come bet­ter play­ers rather than just on win­ning ti­tles.</p>
    <p>LYE, on Idaho State Univer­sity ten­nis coach Alexan­der Free.</p>
    <p>zona, helped his for­mer univer­sity rank as high as No. 21 in the 2018-19 sea­son, their best rank­ing since 2009. They went on to fin­ish 30th that sea­son.</p>
    <p>Other Sin­ga­pore ten­nis play­ers who have re­ceived full ath­letic schol­ar­ships to NCAA Div 1 in­sti­tu­tions in­clude ex-na­tional player Ste­fanie Tan, who grad­u­ated from Texas Chris­tian Univer­sity in 2015, and Char­maine Seah, now a sopho­more at the Univer­sity of Wis­con­sin. Jonathan-Kyle Tan is also a sopho­more at Bos­ton Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Lye, with a ca­reer high of 255 last year in the In­ter­na­tional Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion (ITF) ju­nior rankings and three ti­tles, is the high­est ranked player signed by ISU and he is ex­cited to prove him­self.</p>
    <p>“Play­ing for a smaller school like Idaho, it’s good be­cause I’ll make a dif­fer­ence to the team and I’ll be given the chance to play against great play­ers from bet­ter schools,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Col­lege ten­nis has a good pool of play­ers and you get to play a lot of matches. That helps with get­ting bet­ter at play­ing matches and de­vel­op­ing phys­i­cally as you get older.”</p>
    <p>But in the mean­time, while serv­ing as a com­bat medic, Lye has been fo­cus­ing on build­ing up his strength by do­ing com­pound lifts and ex­er­cis­ing in the gym three to four times a week. He also has ses­sions with his friends once or twice a week where they do drills and play a set.</p>
    <p>Lye, whose last tour­na­ment was in Novem­ber last year, is look­ing for­ward to play­ing com­pet­i­tively again. He said: “I re­ally miss it and I think tak­ing this time off has given me an op­por­tu­nity to re­alise how much I love the sport and how much I took it for granted.</p>
    <p>“At ISU, it’s about learn­ing as much as I can through play­ing many dif­fer­ent play­ers, pick­ing stuff up from the coach and get­ting along with my team­mates.</p>
    <p>“I’m hop­ing to de­velop good pro win­ning habits over there and hope­fully trans­late them to the pro tour when I try to tran­si­tion after col­lege.”</p>
