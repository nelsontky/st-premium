    <p>The owner of one of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est In­dian restau­rants died on Wed­nes­day after­noon at the age of 68.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­joo Gu­nasekaran, owner of K om ala Vi las Veg­e­tar­ian Restau­rant in Lit­tle In­dia, leaves be­hind a son and three daugh­ters. His wife Go­mathi Gu­nasegaran died in Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>He had felt some un­easi­ness while at home on Wed­nes­day morn­ing and was con­veyed by am­bu­lance to the hospi­tal, where he died.</p>
    <p>Ko­mala Vi­las was es­tab­lished in 1947 by Mr Gu­nasekaran’s late fa­ther, Mr Mu­ru­giah Ra­joo.</p>
    <p>Born in In­dia on Sept 2, 1952, Mr Gu­nasekaran took over his fa­ther’s busi­ness and con­tin­ued to run it as a fam­ily busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, his son, Mr Ra­jaku­mar Gu­nasekaran, took over the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Gu­nasekaran served as the chair­man of the In­dian Restau­rants As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) from 2000 to 2004.</p>
    <p>The owner of Gay­a­tri Restau­rant, Mr Shan­mugam Gane­san, 58, said: “He was a very friendly and so­cia­ble per­son who was al­ways very re­laxed and calm.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam, who took over the chair­man­ship of the as­so­ci­a­tion from Mr Gu­nasekaran in 2004, had known him for 34 years and re­called fond mem­o­ries of their trip to­gether to Europe sev­eral years ago.</p>
    <p>The late Mr Gu­nasekaran was known for his phi­lan­thropy. He was an ar­dent sup­porter of com­mu­nity events re­lated to Lit­tle In­dia, the In­dian com­mu­nity as well as Tamil lan­guage and cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness fig­ure Ra­jaku­mar Chan­dra, who re­cently stepped down as chair­man of the Lit­tle In­dia Shop­keep­ers and Her­itage As­so­ci­a­tion (Lisha), said: “Mr Gu­nasekaran was very re­spected among all busi­ness­men in Lit­tle In­dia. Never has he said no to any re­quest for do­na­tions or sup­port, ei­ther by cash or in-kind.”</p>
    <p>“Ko­mala Vi­las is a place that ev­ery Sin­ga­porean iden­ti­fies and is a prom­i­nent fo­cal point for mee­tups. As they em­brace change and in­no­vate, they con­tinue to serve au­then­tic In­dian veg­e­tar­ian food,” added Mr Ra­jaku­mar.</p>
    <p>“Mr Gu­nasekaran’s hard work and de­ter­mi­na­tion are key in­gre­di­ents for its suc­cess.”</p>
    <p>The restau­rant at 76-78 Seran­goon Road came un­der the spot­light when Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong took In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi there for sup­per in 2015.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi was in Sin­ga­pore for a two-day visit to mark 50 years of diplo­matic ties be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr C. Sankaranat­han, 48, the cur­rent chair­man of Lisha, said Mr Gu­nasekaran’s death is a great loss to the In­dian com­mu­nity and for Lisha.</p>
    <p>“We are all deeply sad­dened and shocked,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Known for his aus­pi­cious pres­ence, Mr Gu­nasekaran was the per­son whom my fa­ther in­vited to of­fi­ci­ate at the open­ing of The Ba­nana Leaf Apolo restau­rant at Race Course Road and the Ap­pollo Sel­lap­pas de­part­ment store at Dun­lop Street,” said Mr Shankarana­than, the owner of both com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Mr Gu­nasekaran’s body was cre­mated at Mandai Cre­ma­to­rium yes­ter­day.</p>
