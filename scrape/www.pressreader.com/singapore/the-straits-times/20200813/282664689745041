    <p>Ital­ian painter Raphael prob­a­bly did not like his nose and re­placed it with an ide­alised ver­sion in his fa­mous self-por­trait.</p>
    <p>That is the con­clu­sion of Rome Univer­sity sci­en­tists, who pro­duced a 3D com­puter re­con­struc­tion of the Re­nais­sance master’s face from a plas­ter cast of his pre­sumed skull made in 1833.</p>
    <p>That year, the re­mains be­lieved to be those of Raphael – hailed by his con­tem­po­raries as “the divine one” be­cause he sought per­fec­tion through his work – were ex­humed.</p>
    <p>“He cer­tainly made his nose look more re­fined,” said Pro­fes­sor Mat­tia Fal­coni, a molec­u­lar bi­ol­o­gist at the univer­sity’s Tor Ver­gata cam­pus. “His nose was, let’s say, slightly more prom­i­nent.”</p>
    <p>Raphael died in Rome in 1520 at the age of 37 and was buried in Rome’s Pan­theon. His self-por­trait, which nor­mally hangs in Florence’s Uf­fizi gallery but is cur­rently in Rome for an ex­hi­bi­tion mark­ing the 500th an­niver­sary of the artist’s death, was done about 15 years ear­lier, when he was clean-shaven.</p>
    <p>It fea­tures the more aquiline nose that Raphael had in­cluded in other works in which he painted him­self.</p>
    <p>The re­con­struc­tion is of the way he may have looked closer to his death, when he wore a beard.</p>
    <p>Prof Fal­coni, along with foren­sic an­thro­pol­o­gists and other ex­perts, re­con­structed the face with tis­sue­lay­er­ing tech­niques used by crime in­ves­ti­ga­tors. The re­sult was a face sim­i­lar to that of Raphael on an en­grav­ing by Ital­ian en­graver Mar­can­to­nio Rai­mondi, one of Raphael’s stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“When we fin­ished, I said to my­self: ‘I’ve seen that face be­fore,’” Prof Fal­coni, 57, said in a tele­phone in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>An­other sim­i­lar­ity is with the sub­ject of Por­trait Of A Man, painted be­tween 1512 and 1515 by Se­bas­tiano del Piombo, a Raphael con­tem­po­rary and ri­val.</p>
    <p>“We have con­crete ev­i­dence for the first time that the skele­ton ex­humed in 1833 be­longs to Raf­faello Sanzio,” Prof Fal­coni said, re­fer­ring to Raphael’s name.</p>
    <p>For cen­turies, there has been spec­u­la­tion that the bones ex­humed in 1833 and re­buried in a re-styled crypt may not have been Raphael’s, as some of his stu­dents were later buried near him.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar myth has it that the Re­nais­sance painter, who was said to have had an ac­tive sex life, suc­cumbed to syphilis in 1520, though ex­perts widely agree he died of pneu­mo­nia, pos­si­bly af­ter vis­it­ing lovers late on freez­ing nights.</p>
    <p>A 3D re­con­struc­tion “cap­tures only 80 per cent of the orig­i­nal face, but there’s no doubt about the re­sult”, Prof Fal­coni said. “It looks noth­ing like the stu­dents we know are buried there and it would be too much of a co­in­ci­dence for a stranger to look so sim­i­lar.”</p>
    <p>He said the only part of the face that could not be re­con­structed this way were the ears – “but, for­tu­nately, Raphael had long hair that cov­ered his ears”.</p>
    <p>Con­fir­ma­tion that the skele­ton is Raphael’s opens the door to fur­ther anal­y­sis to de­ter­mine hair and eye colour, but a project to re-ex­hume the body this year was put on hold due to the pan­demic. If it re­sumes, Prof Fal­coni said his team would be in­ter­ested in see­ing how faith­ful the artist was to his real self.</p>
    <p>“We know that Raphael of­ten painted him­self younger than his years and this model al­lows us to see him as he re­ally was,” he said.</p>
    <p>A life-size 3D-printed bust of the man – dubbed the “prince of painters” by fel­low artist and famed 16th-cen­tury bi­og­ra­pher Giorgio Vasari – will go on dis­play at the mu­seum at Raphael’s birth­place in</p>
    <p>Urbino in Italy’s Marche re­gion.</p>
    <p>De­spite his pre­ma­ture death, Raphael pro­duced a vast oeu­vre of sem­i­nal work, much of it at the Vat­i­can, whose op­u­lent mu­se­ums in­clude rooms filled with his fres­coes.</p>
    <p>Com­pleted by Raphael’s stu­dents af­ter his death, they re­main some of the Vat­i­can’s most pop­u­lar rooms.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­one was pleased with Prof Fal­coni’s re­search. An art critic for Rome news­pa­per La Repub­blica said it had pro­duced a cheap “videogame ver­sion” of Raphael.</p>
    <p>Prof Fal­coni said he hoped the tomb can be opened again some­day for direct tests on the skull. This could re­solve sev­eral mysteries, such as con­firm­ing what caused Raphael’s death.</p>
