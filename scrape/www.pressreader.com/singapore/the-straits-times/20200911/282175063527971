    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK With five matches down at the US Open, Do­minic Thiem still finds it dif­fi­cult to main­tain in­ten­sity in the ab­sence of fans.</p>
    <p>But even with­out them, the sec­ond seed ex­pects his semi-fi­nal clash against last year’s Flush­ing Mead­ows fi­nal­ist Daniil Medvedev to be a block­buster.</p>
    <p>Thiem took down Aus­tralian Alex de Min­aur 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 in Wed­nes­day’s last match at the Arthur Ashe Sta­dium, which would in pre­vi­ous years be bustling with a crowd of close to 24,000.</p>
    <p>But no fans are al­lowed at the hard-court Grand Slam due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s not easy men­tally to keep all the time the 100 per cent en­ergy,” Thiem told re­porters via video con­fer­ence call.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing else I (have) got used to. But there are some sit­u­a­tions in every match ba­si­cally where it would be nice to have the crowd just to keep the en­ergy up, just to cel­e­brate great points, that it doesn’t feel that bad if you (are) go­ing through a tough pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“That was not easy to get used to. But it’s a unique sit­u­a­tion. Now I’m in the semis, it was my fifth match to­day so I got used to it. (But) there’s still sit­u­a­tions where it’s dif­fi­cult or where the en­ergy of the crowd would help.”</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of top seed No­vak Djokovic, who lost by de­fault in the fourth round, and Rafael Nadal and Roger Fed­erer – who opted out of this year’s tour­na­ment – the men’s draw will have its first new Grand Slam cham­pion in six years on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Thiem has had three chances to be­come a Ma­jor cham­pion, los­ing in two French Open fi­nals and the Aus­tralian Open show­piece match in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Medvedev also had a two-set lead over Nadal be­fore he lost in New York last year, which ac­cord­ing to the Aus­trian was one of the “bet­ter Slam fi­nals ever” and he ex­pects the Rus­sian to pose a big threat, with both play­ers des­per­ate to break their Slam duck.</p>
    <p>“I would say that he comes very close to the big three play­ers in terms that he can play his top level, for doesn’t mat­ter how long,” said Thiem. “That’s go­ing to be re­ally, re­ally dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s go­ing to be a big stage, even if it’s with­out fans. It’s go­ing to be a great semi-fi­nal.”</p>
    <p>In the women’s draw, Ser­ena Wil­liams paid trib­ute to her fel­low pros, who are jug­gling play­ing on the WTA Tour, while also adapt­ing to their role as new moth­ers.</p>
    <p>The 23-time Slam win­ner, who is seek­ing to tie Mar­garet Court’s all­time record in New York, was tested en route to a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 quar­ter-fi­nal win over Tsve­tana Pironkova.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing her first child two years ago, Bul­gar­ian Pironkova made a sur­prise run in her first tour­na­ment in three years, lead­ing for­mer world No. 1 Wil­liams to ac­knowl­edge “how tough mums are”.</p>
    <p>“When­ever you can birth a baby, hon­estly, you can do any­thing and you saw that with Tsve­tana to­day,” the Amer­i­can said. “She played un­be­liev­able. I could barely win a match when I came back.”</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old takes on another mum in two-time Ma­jor win­ner Vic­to­ria Azarenka of Be­larus for a place in to­mor­row’s fi­nal.</p>
