    <p>UTOPIA AV­ENUE</p>
    <p>By David Mitchell Scep­tre/Pa­per­back/ 563 pages/ $29.71/ Avail­able at bit.ly/Utopi­aAve_DM 2020, most would agree, is not a fun year to be liv­ing in. En­ter one of the most trans­port­ing nov­els of the year, in which Bri­tish au­thor David Mitchell takes read­ers on a glo­ri­ous nos­tal­gia trip to the Lon­don of the Swing­ing Six­ties.</p>
    <p>It is a time and place awash with what mu­si­cian and pro­ducer Brian Eno calls “sce­nius”, the con­flu­ent ge­nius of a cul­tural scene. Float­ing some­where be­tween the psy­che­delic Sum­mer of Love and the dark side of the moon is Utopia Av­enue, an im­pos­si­ble des­ti­na­tion, an ad­dress for a place that can­not ex­ist.</p>
    <p>This is the eighth novel by Mitchell, a two-time Booker Prize-short­listed au­thor best known for the nested nar­ra­tives of Cloud At­las (2004).</p>
    <p>Broke blues bassist Dean Moss gets an in­vi­ta­tion to join the eclec­tic, genre-bending band that will go on to be named Utopia Av­enue.</p>
    <p>His new band­mates are Elf Hol­loway, a folk singer fresh from a bad break-up, pro­fes­sion­ally and per­son­ally; Peter “Griff” Grif­fin, a rough-edged jazz drum­mer from York­shire; and Jasper de Zoet, an enig­matic vir­tu­oso gui­tarist who spent years in a men­tal asy­lum.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a rocky start, they ex­pe­ri­ence a me­te­oric rise to fame that cul­mi­nates in an Amer­i­can tour be­fore tragedy strikes.</p>
    <p>For fans of the Six­ties, this is not a novel to be missed. It is a panoply of cameos from a who’s who of mu­sic leg­ends, a mi­lieu where one could bump into John Len­non un­der a ta­ble at a party, flirt with Leonard Co­hen in a Chelsea Ho­tel el­e­va­tor or run into a yet-to-be-fa­mous David Bowie in a stair­well, re­gal­ing strangers with his dreams.</p>
    <p>Char­ac­ters hang out with Brian Jones, The Rolling Stones’ founder, Jimi Hen­drix and Ja­nis Jo­plin. All three died in real life at the age of 27 be­tween 1969 and 1970.</p>
    <p>Utopia Av­enue is also part of the wider web that is Mitchell’s metafic­tional “uber-novel”. Char­ac­ters from his other books make ap­pear­ances, like Levon Fran­k­land from The Bone Clocks (2014), the band’s sur­pris­ingly de­cent man­ager. Jasper, a de­scen­dant of the pro­tag­o­nist of The Thou­sand Au­tumns Of Ja­cob De Zoet (2010), lis­tens to a sex­tet com­posed in Cloud At­las.</p>
    <p>This will be de­light­ful to Mitchell acolytes and baf­fling to peo­ple new to his canon, rock mu­sic or both.</p>
    <p>The novel’s struc­ture is based on the track listings of the band’s three al­bums, with each chap­ter told from the point of view of who­ever wrote that song. This is largely divvied up be­tween Dean, Jasper and Elf, the band’s song­writ­ers.</p>
    <p>Dean runs through a gallery of tabloid scan­dals: a pa­ter­nity dis­pute, an adul­ter­ous af­fair and even a stint in Ital­ian jail for al­leged drug pos­ses­sion – set against the grim back­drop of his hard­scrab­ble child­hood with an abu­sive father.</p>
    <p>Elf strug­gles to hold her own in a male-dom­i­nated in­dus­try, where the hand­ful of suc­cess­ful fe­male mu­si­cians are like “princesses in the age of dy­nas­tic mar­riages”, as she con­fides to Jo­plin. They are re­duced to fod­der for locker-room brag­ging, agrees Jo­plin. “How do you fight it? Or change it? Or sur­vive it?”</p>
    <p>Jasper’s story arc is the most bizarre – which, for a Mitchell novel set dur­ing the height of psychedeli­a, is not say­ing much. The il­le­git­i­mate scion of a blue-blooded Dutch house, he has gone through life with a malev­o­lent en­tity he calls Knock Knock inside his head, who, af­ter years of dor­mancy, is now de­ter­mined to take over his body.</p>
    <p>In a band, the drum­mer usu­ally gets short shrift. That is the case for Griff, though he does get a chap­ter to him­self. So does Levon, who – be­ing Jewish, gay and Cana­dian – is no stranger to the prej­u­dices of the era. Their chap­ters, brief but ten­der, sit at the heart of the novel.</p>
    <p>“Writ­ing about mu­sic is like danc­ing about ar­chi­tec­ture” is an apho­rism that has been at­trib­uted to many. Mitchell puts it in the mouth of mu­si­cian Frank Zappa, quot­ing jazz great Charles Min­gus.</p>
    <p>Of course, by this point in the novel, Mitchell has al­ready spent more than 500 pages writ­ing about mu­sic, show­ing off his prow­ess at de­scrib­ing the in­de­scrib­able.</p>
    <p>A song is “riff-sticky”; singer-song­writer Joni Mitchell’s voice is “vod­kaon-ice”. He writes of the Cloud At­las sex­tet: “An oboe has lost its way. Upon hear­ing a vi­o­lin in the thorns, the oboe picks a path to­wards it, meta­mor­phos­ing into what it seeks.”</p>
    <p>“In 50 years,” says Jasper, “or 500, or 5,000, mu­sic will still do to peo­ple what it does to us now.” Utopia may be a non-place, but with Mitchell’s words, one feels one might see it again some day on the av­enue.</p>
