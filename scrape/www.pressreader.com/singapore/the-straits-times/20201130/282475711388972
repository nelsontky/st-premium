    <p>Manch­ester City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola re­vealed that his play­ers could not revel in their 5-0 Premier League vic­tory over Burn­ley on Satur­day, as hec­tic match sched­ul­ing had sucked some of the joy out of the sport.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic forced last sea­son to fin­ish late and this cam­paign to be con­densed into a shorter pe­riod, with a cho­rus of man­agers lament­ing the re­lent­less sched­ule that they be­lieve has con­trib­uted to more in­juries.</p>
    <p>City, who bounced back from last week’s de­feat by Tot­ten­ham and moved up to eighth be­fore yes­ter­day’s fix­tures with the re­sound­ing win over Burn­ley, travel to Porto for a Cham­pi­ons League game to­mor­row be­fore fac­ing Ful­ham in the Premier League on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola be­lieves the back-to­back games are tak­ing a toll on his team.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem is the play­ers lose the joy of play­ing foot­ball,” he said. “Be­fore it was nice play­ing once or twice a week with spec­ta­tors. Now it’s three days and then an­other one. We will travel to Porto to win, then pre­pare against Ful­ham.”</p>
    <p>He could at least take com­fort in the fact that his side man­aged to put their scor­ing woes to one side at the Eti­had. City had net­ted just 10 times in their open­ing eight games be­fore Satur­day’s vic­tory and Guardi­ola urged his for­wards to start de­liv­er­ing if they are to re­tain their spot in the team.</p>
    <p>Riyad Mahrez scored a hat-trick, while Ben­jamin Mendy and Fer­ran Tor­res were the other scor­ers, as City net­ted five in their fourth con­sec­u­tive home meet­ing with the Clarets. But Guardi­ola felt they could not al­ways pick up the slack if his strik­ers are not fir­ing on all cylin­ders.</p>
    <p>“The goals help us, of course. Gabriel Je­sus (two league strikes this term) has to score goals. Ra­heem Ster­ling (two strikes) when he plays, has to score,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They have to score more goals. That is why they are here. It de­pends on the play­ers, their per­for­mance on the pitch.”</p>
    <p>His wor­ries that the Clarets rout may be a one-off in­ten­si­fied af­ter Ser­gio Aguero suf­fered an­other set­back on the morn­ing of Satur­day’s game, rul­ing him out of the clash with Sean Dy­che’s men.</p>
    <p>The striker has missed the end of last sea­son and most of the cur­rent cam­paign through in­jury.</p>
    <p>He re­turned at home to Ar­se­nal but has been on the side­lines since pick­ing up an­other prob­lem in the sub­se­quent game at West Ham.</p>
    <p>Aguero came off the bench to make his come­back at Greek out­fit Olympiakos in the Cham­pi­ons League last Wednesday, but Guardi­ola ad­mit­ted he could not put a timescale on when the Ar­gen­tinian would be able to re­turn fully fit.</p>
    <p>“Ser­gio, de­pends how he wakes up. He makes good train­ing ses­sions and then has some nig­gles,” he said. “He woke up with a lit­tle prob­lem in his knee.</p>
    <p>“We know the in­jury he had is not easy for the re­cov­ery. We have to han­dle it as best as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, Ever­ton’s stand-in cap­tain Ma­son Hol­gate called on his team­mates to do bet­ter fol­low­ing a run of poor per­for­mances cul­mi­nat­ing in a 1-0 de­feat by Leeds.</p>
    <p>The Tof­fees had two goals ruled out for off­side be­fore Raphinha struck the win­ner for Leeds in the 79th minute, as the hosts slumped to their fourth de­feat in five league games.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been beaten in a few games now, which we’re not happy with,” Hol­gate told Sky Sports. “We know we have to do bet­ter than we’re doing and the in­con­sis­tency needs to be dropped.”</p>
    <p>EMO­TION­ALLY SAP­PING</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is the play­ers lose the joy of play­ing foot­ball. Be­fore it was nice play­ing once or twice a week with spec­ta­tors. Now it’s three days and then an­other one.</p>
