    <p>Foot­ball may be Sin­ga­pore’s No. 1 sport but there are other sport­ing love af­fairs around our is­land. In this new fort­nightly se­ries, The Straits Times seeks out new games and dis­cov­ers that a coun­try’s pas­sion for sport, even in this time of Covid, burns brightly.</p>
    <p>Us­ing a scooter con­sist­ing of bi­cy­cle parts and Rollerblad­e wheels, Muhd Nur Pu­tra Shah­fiq Anuar would spend hours learn­ing tricks at skate parks.</p>
    <p>With few options for scoot­ers that could be used to per­form stunts in 2010, the then 15-yearold re­lied on on­line tu­to­ri­als to turn his scooter, which was meant for cruis­ing, into one that would be able to with­stand the im­pact of ac­ro­batic land­ings of freestyle scooter­ing.</p>
    <p>Like skate­board­ing and bi­cy­cle mo­tocross (BMX), freestyle scooter­ing is an ex­treme sport that in­volves rid­ers per­form­ing tricks or stunts.</p>
    <p>A decade on, Shah­fiq, now 25, no longer uses makeshift equip­ment and has had the chance to ride along­side pro­fes­sional rid­ers from around the world at in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>But one thing that has not changed is the thrill he gets from nail­ing a trick, whether it is on the in­ter­na­tional stage or at a ca­sual session with friends.</p>
    <p>He said: “The adren­a­line and land­ing tricks will never get old. I’ve been to (many) places and known so many good peo­ple around the world all be­cause of scooter­ing.”</p>
    <p>Stunts can range from jump­ing off ramps to grav­ity-de­fy­ing flips, which are done on spe­cially made scoot­ers that have stur­dier decks and han­dle bars that do not fold.</p>
    <p>So keen was Shah­fiq, who spends 10 to 15 hours a week on his pas­sion, that he even landed him­self a spon­sor some years back.</p>
    <p>The rou­tines that he posted on so­cial me­dia caught the eye of Aus­tralian scooter brand Root In­dus­tries in 2014. It spon­sored him for five years, giv­ing him the op­por­tu­nity to travel over­seas for freestyle scooter­ing com­pe­ti­tions. It also backed him by send­ing him care pack­ages con­tain­ing scooter parts.</p>
    <p>One com­pe­ti­tion that Shah­fiq has fond mem­o­ries of is Street Jam, an event held on the streets of Syd­ney. Lo­cal and pro­fes­sional rid­ers from around the world would visit dif­fer­ent places in the city where they would spend 30 to 40 min­utes per­form­ing tricks be­fore mov­ing on to the next spot.</p>
    <p>The per­son who did the best trick at each place would be re­warded, with Shah­fiq win­ning A$150 (S$148) at one of the spots.</p>
    <p>The event would of­ten at­tract cu­ri­ous on­look­ers, in­clud­ing the lo­cal po­lice who would cheer them on.</p>
    <p>Shah­fiq dreams of t he day scooter­ing will en­joy a sim­i­lar level of com­mu­nity sup­port here.</p>
    <p>“The Aus­tralian scooter­ing cul­ture is very dif­fer­ent from Sin­ga­pore. They are very com­pet­i­tive but at the same time sup­port­ive. I ad­mire how ev­ery­one would be stoked when some­one nails a sim­ple trick or line,” said Shah­fiq, who works in events.</p>
    <p>“I feel Sin­ga­pore rid­ers need the same to keep scooter­ing fun and alive.”</p>
    <p>While the scene in Sin­ga­pore is still rel­a­tively small, it is a lot more vi­brant than it was 10 years ago. Back then, Shah­fiq and his group of five friends were of­ten the only scooter rid­ers at skate parks where they some­times re­ceived hos­tile re­marks from oth­ers who ridiculed their sport.</p>
    <p>He said: “We faced so much hate when we were at the skate parks with our fold­able scoot­ers. Most of them said, ‘You guys are not sup­posed to be here, get a skate­board’ and all those neg­a­tive vibes, but we didn’t re­ally care and kept on rid­ing.”</p>
    <p>These days, there is greater ac­cep­tance of scooter­ing, with more pop­u­lar spots for rid­ers such as the East Coast Xtreme Skatepark filled with scooter rid­ers on week­ends, al­though Shah­fiq es­ti­mates that there are only about 50 to 80 se­ri­ous rid­ers in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The sport is prov­ing to be pop­u­lar among the younger gen­er­a­tion, with many pick­ing up the sport from as young as eight. The ma­jor­ity of the rid­ers in Sin­ga­pore are male and be­tween the ages of nine and 17.</p>
    <p>With a plethora of scooter­ing videos on so­cial me­dia, many of to­day’s rid­ers find their in­spi­ra­tion on­line and they then at­tempt to repli­cate moves at the skate parks or on the streets. They are of­ten in the com­pany of other rid­ers who en­cour­age them and they help each other record their rou­tines on video, which are up­loaded to their so­cial me­dia pages.</p>
    <p>The per­cep­tion that scooter­ing is not a sport still lingers, but in re­al­ity, it is no child’s play.</p>
    <p>When Cal­lum Thomas Cle­ment first picked up the sport 3½ years ago, there was an ini­tial fear that he had to over­come be­cause it was un­like any sport that he had done.</p>
    <p>It took the Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, who plays foot­ball and rugby, about a month to get com­fort­able go­ing down the ramps.</p>
    <p>The 16-year-old said: “It was quite scary be­cause ev­ery­thing was so new and the ramps looked quite daunt­ing and big so the first few times I did it, I was go­ing around to try and get used to the ramps.</p>
    <p>“It’s a com­pletely dif­fer­ent sport. For rugby and foot­ball, it’s all about team­work, but for this (scooter­ing), it’s about in­di­vid­u­ally push­ing your­self to where you want to be and where you think you can be and what you can learn.”</p>
    <p>In­juries are also com­mon. The Nexus In­ter­na­tional stu­dent has bro­ken a few fin­gers while Shah­fiq frac­tured his left an­kle when do­ing a trick over a con­struc­tion cone.</p>
    <p>But the ex­cite­ment of land­ing a new trick and be­ing able to en­joy scooter­ing with his friends is what Cal­lum, who hopes to com­pete in in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions in the fu­ture, loves most about the sport.</p>
    <p>With more young tal­ents like Cal­lum emerg­ing from Sin­ga­pore’s freestyle scooter­ing scene, Shah­fiq is con­fi­dent that more will be able to fol­low in his foot­steps.</p>
    <p>He said: “I truly be­lieve some­day, Sin­ga­pore’s scooter cul­ture will even­tu­ally reach a proper sport level and grow just like skate­board­ing and any other ex­treme sports.”</p>
