    <p>A pro­posal to have a fully gov­ern­ment-funded pub­lic de­fend­ers’ of­fice in Sin­ga­pore was lauded by the le­gal fra­ter­nity yes­ter­day, as it will en­sure ac­cess to jus­tice for those with lower in­comes and boost the coun­try’s rep­u­ta­tion as a le­gal hub.</p>
    <p>But le­gal pro­fes­sion­als also warned of chal­lenges, in­clud­ing de­cid­ing how much to pay the lawyers and hav­ing safe­guards to en­sure peo­ple do not abuse the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>They made these points a day af­ter Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam an­nounced that the Gov­ern­ment is study­ing the fea­si­bil­ity of set­ting up a pub­lic de­fend­ers’ of­fice. The Law Min­istry is in favour of it, he said, when an­nounc­ing the plan in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>In such a set-up, the Gov­ern­ment pays and em­ploys the lawyers in a sep­a­rate struc­ture, to de­fend the ac­cused in crim­i­nal cases who can­not af­ford to pay for their own lawyers.</p>
    <p>Ms Ste­fanie Yuen-Thio, joint man­ag­ing part­ner at TSMP Law Corp, said the pro­posal was an “enor­mously sig­nif­i­cant step”.</p>
    <p>“For decades, the Gov­ern­ment’s po­si­tion was that it didn’t make sense to be both pros­e­cut­ing the ac­cused and pay­ing for his de­fence.”</p>
    <p>The move, she said, is an ac­knowl­edge­ment of the Crim­i­nal Le­gal Aid Scheme – a pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ship to pro­vide pro bono le­gal aid to the needy – and that es­tab­lish­ing a gov­ern­ment body would sup­port the ef­fort with more re­sources.</p>
    <p>Law Pro­fes­sor Ku­mar­alingam Amirthalin­gam of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore said a pub­lic de­fend­ers’ of­fice would be a “very im­por­tant sig­nal by the Gov­ern­ment that it is com­mit­ted to a crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem that... re­spects the pre­sump­tion of in­no­cence”.</p>
    <p>It will elim­i­nate sit­u­a­tions of un­equal out­comes sim­ply be­cause those who are rich can af­ford lawyers to de­fend them prop­erly.</p>
    <p>It would also im­prove the ef­fi­ciency of the le­gal sys­tem as cases can move through the courts faster, said Prof Ku­mar­alingam. “If you’re not rep­re­sented by a lawyer, then it takes longer as you don’t know the sys­tem, and will take more time to con­sider whether to plead guilty or to claim trial.”</p>
    <p>It also “ben­e­fits Sin­ga­pore in terms of in­ter­na­tional rep­u­ta­tion, and in global rank­ings on rule of law and jus­tice”, he said.</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal lawyer Ra­jan Supra­ma­niam, a con­sul­tant at Ed­mond Pereira Law Corp, stressed that the rules gov­ern­ing the func­tions of such an of­fice will need to be clear. “The Gov­ern­ment will have to en­sure that peo­ple don’t take ad­van­tage of it, that mem­bers of the pub­lic do not abuse it, and only the needy will be given the le­gal aid,” he said.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ex­ploita­tion in some coun­tries, “it’s not a rea­son not to do some­thing”, said Prof Ku­mar­alingam, adding that ap­pro­pri­ate mea­sures need to be in place to mon­i­tor and au­dit the of­fice.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge is to fund the pro­gramme suf­fi­ciently for the long term to at­tract tal­ent, with­out wast­ing pub­lic funds, the lawyers said.</p>
    <p>One crit­i­cal risk Mr Ra­jan pointed out is that even if there is no merit in a case, the ac­cused may want to ex­haust all op­tions as the fi­nan­cial bur­den is not on him.</p>
    <p>But Ms Yuen-Thio stressed the ded­i­ca­tion lawyers have shown in pro bono cases “is born of the sense that we have an obli­ga­tion to use our skills to help those who need it”.</p>
    <p>She said the pub­lic de­fend­ers’ of­fice should be mind­ful not to di­min­ish the “cru­sad­ing zeal” of lawyers.</p>
    <p>“We wouldn’t want the next gen­er­a­tion of prac­ti­tion­ers to feel less of an ur­gency be­cause the Gov­ern­ment will han­dle it.”</p>
