    <p>THE DUKE AND HIS WIVES: Tony Le­ung Chiu Wai, who fa­mously played the ti­tle char­ac­ter of the 1984 TVB drama se­rial The Duke Of Mount Deer, re­united with three of his wives in the show re­cently.</p>
    <p>The re­union took place at the 60th birth­day cel­e­bra­tion of Hong Kong ac­tress Teresa Mo (right), who acted as one of the wives along with ac­tresses Ca­rina Lau (far right) and San­dra Ng (fore­ground).</p>
    <p>The show, an adap­ta­tion of late nov­el­ist Louis Cha’s an­ti­hero novel of the same ti­tle, starred Le­ung, now 58, as the il­lit­er­ate but smart pro­tag­o­nist Wei Xiaobao, who is the son of a pros­ti­tute and a friend of Kangxi em­peror, played in the show by Andy Lau.</p>
    <p>Wei has seven wives and Mo played one of the wives, Mu Jian­ping.</p>
    <p>Ca­rina Lau, 54, who is Le­ung’s wife in real life, played Fang Yi, while Ng, 55, played Zeng Rou in the show.</p>
    <p>Kiki She­ung, Flora King, Elaine Chow and Tomi Wong played the other four wives.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Mo posted on In­sta­gram a photo she took with Le­ung, Lau and Ng and wrote: “Wei Xiaobao and his wives 36 years later.”</p>
    <p>She also used hash­tags such as #Gather­ingOfOldFr­iends and #Birth­dayDin­nerWhichKe­ep­sGo­ing.</p>
    <p>Mo, who was named Best Ac­tress at the Hong Kong Film Awards in 2018 for her role as the mother of an autis­tic young man in To­mor­row Is An­other Day (2018), is mar­ried to film di­rec­tor Tony Au. The cou­ple have two daugh­ters.</p>
    <p>Ng, whose role as a pros­ti­tute in the movie Golden Chicken (2002) won her the Best Ac­tress award at Tai­wan’s Golden Horse Awards in 2003, has a 14-year-old daugh­ter with her long-time part­ner, di­rec­tor Peter Chan.</p>
