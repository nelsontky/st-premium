    <p>NEW YORK • Side ef­fects from Covid-19 vac­cines rang­ing from fevers and chills to headaches and joint pain could keep some doc­tors and nurses from work­ing amid a surge in hospi­tal­i­sa­tions across the United States.</p>
    <p>Health sys­tems are gear­ing up to vac­ci­nate key hospi­tal staff with the Pfizer and Moderna coro­n­avirus shots, which could start ship­ping across the US in a mat­ter of weeks, pend­ing emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, fed­eral ad­vis­ers rec­om­mended that US health­care work­ers be im­mu­nised first, along with res­i­dents of long-term care fa­cil­i­ties. For hos­pi­tals, that could pose sig­nif­i­cant sched­ul­ing is­sues at a time when many are fill­ing up. More than 100,000 Amer­i­cans were hos­pi­talised with the coro­n­avirus on Wed­nes­day, ac­cord­ing to data from the Covid Track­ing Project.</p>
    <p>Providers will need to pull med­i­cal staff from the bed­side to the vac­ci­na­tion clinic to get their shots. And if side ef­fects do oc­cur, they could lose key work­ers for a cou­ple of days. To over­come this, some hos­pi­tals plan to stag­ger staff to keep units cov­ered. Others are ex­plor­ing giv­ing work­ers the shots at the end of their shifts, be­fore they have a few days off.</p>
    <p>Still, it is dif­fi­cult to know what to ex­pect without see­ing full data from Pfizer and Moderna’s large, late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als, said Dr Paul Bid­dinger, vice-chair­man of emer­gency pre­pared­ness at Mas­sachusetts Gen­eral Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lit­tle eas­ier to cre­ate a model for how we should stag­ger em­ployee vac­ci­na­tions when we know how com­monly (side ef­fects) are oc­cur­ring and with what sever­ity,” Dr Bid­dinger said. Plans could change when more ro­bust data be­comes avail­able, he added.</p>
    <p>While the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms have yet to re­lease full re­sults from their largest tri­als, dis­clo­sures from ear­lier tests in re­cent press re­leases give a sense of their safety pro­files.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech said no se­ri­ous safety con­cerns were ob­served in their late-stage trial. Among par­tic­i­pants who had the two-dose vac­cine reg­i­men, 3.8 per cent ex­pe­ri­enced fa­tigue, and 2 per cent had headaches. Older adults re­ported fewer and milder ad­verse events. In an ear­lier trial, cases of mild-to-mod­er­ate fever were iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Moderna said it had also noted no se­ri­ous safety con­cerns in its late-stage trial. Mild-to-mod­er­ate side ef­fects in­cluded fa­tigue (9.7 per cent), mus­cle or joint pain (5.2 per cent) headache (4.5 per cent) and in­jec­tion-site pain (2.7 per cent). The side ef­fects were more com­mon af­ter the sec­ond dose of the two-dose vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“We see side-ef­fect pro­files that are com­mon to other vac­cines we use,” said Dr Buddy Creech, di­rec­tor of Van­der­bilt Vac­cine Re­search Pro­gramme, who is lead­ing tri­als of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Only a small pro­por­tion of those who get the vac­cines will have side ef­fects, added Dr Creech, who also serves as the prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor for both Moderna and John­son & John­son’s phase three clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>But the po­ten­tial of pos­si­ble side ef­fects strong enough to put health work­ers out of com­mis­sion needs to be raised be­fore the vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign starts, he added. If that is not ef­fec­tively com­mu­ni­cated, hos­pi­tals might be left un­der­staffed.</p>
    <p>At the same time, med­i­cal work­ers must also be taught to dis­tin­guish be­tween side ef­fects from the vac­cine and symp­toms from Covid-19, given that they are highly ex­posed to the virus.</p>
