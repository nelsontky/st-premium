    <p>In­dia is see­ing a six-month low in the num­ber of daily Covid-19 cases even as mul­ti­ple In­dian states have im­posed re­stric­tions to en­sure New Year cel­e­bra­tions will not erode these gains.</p>
    <p>With over 10.2 mil­lion cases, In­dia is the world’s sec­ond worst-hit coun­try by the pan­demic after the United States, and has seen daily cases hov­er­ing at around 20,000, in stark con­trast to a high of 97,000 cases in mid-Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Ac­tive cases have fallen to be­low 270,000 for the first time in six months.</p>
    <p>The down­ward trend in the world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous coun­try comes in spite of Covid-19 fa­tigue felt by the pop­u­la­tion, with not all fol­low­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing norms or wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>While there is no de­fin­i­tive sin­gle rea­son, epi­demi­ol­o­gists and sci­en­tists be­lieve a key fac­tor is that dense ur­ban cen­tres, which were the worst af­fected, now have some level of com­mu­nity pro­tec­tion, cou­pled with a slower in­crease in cases in ru­ral parts which are not as densely pop­u­lated.</p>
    <p>Based on a math­e­mat­i­cal study com­mis­sioned by the govern­ment, a group of top sci­en­tists in Oc­to­ber con­cluded that the pan­demic – which turned ur­ban cen­tres such as cap­i­tal city Delhi and fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal Mum­bai into Covid-19 hot spots – peaked in In­dia in Septem­ber and will be un­der control by Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Delhi, for in­stance, recorded 703 cases on Mon­day, com­pared with over 7,000 new cases daily last month.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Mathuku­malli Vidyasagar, who led the study, said the Oc­to­ber pre­dic­tions were “hold­ing up pretty well”.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic will reach a man­age­able pro­por­tion by the end of Fe­bru­ary. As per our cur­rent pro­jec­tions, it will hit 30,000 to 40,000 ac­tive cases, or pos­si­bly fewer, be­fore the end of Fe­bru­ary,” said Prof Vidyasagar of the In­dian In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy Hy­der­abad. He is also a fel­low of the Royal So­ci­ety of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“The cases are com­ing down be­cause the num­ber of peo­ple who have de­vel­oped im­mu­nity to the virus is high. The two sero­log­i­cal sur­veys con­ducted by the ICMR (In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search) and our model also show that in the cities, the pan­demic spread in the ini­tial stages where peo­ple were crowded to­gether and they came into con­tact with each other quite a bit more. It means im­mu­nity also de­vel­oped faster.”</p>
    <p>Vi­rol­o­gist Shahid Jameel noted that a clutch of sero­log­i­cal sur­veys pointed to 30 per cent pos­i­tiv­ity across In­dia, and some­where in the range of 50 per cent in large dense cities.</p>
    <p>“This de­cline (in coro­n­avirus cases) has been steady and pro­longed, with the fall some­what slower than the rise. Within this fall in na­tional fig­ures, there are small re­gional spikes and that will con­tinue to hap­pen in the days to come,” he said.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has had 148,000 coro­n­avirus deaths, ac­cord­ing to the Health Min­istry. Of these, 70 per cent were among men. In the past week, there were two deaths per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion in In­dia, com­pared with 47 deaths per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion in the US.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor K. Sri­nath Reddy, pres­i­dent of the Public Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia, said: “The situation is very en­cour­ag­ing but we still need to keep the vigil. We should not frit­ter away our gains through care­less­ness and pre­ma­ture dec­la­ra­tion of vic­tory. That is the les­son from global ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>He noted that more ef­fec­tive test­ing and iso­la­tion pro­to­cols were also fac­tors be­hind the down­turn.</p>
