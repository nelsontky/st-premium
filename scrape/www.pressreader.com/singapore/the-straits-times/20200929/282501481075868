    <p>The el­e­ments of the­atre that make it so elec­tric to ex­pe­ri­ence in a dark hall with ac­tual ac­tors on a stage – the in­ti­macy of phys­i­cal pres­ence, the peren­nial threat of things go­ing wrong, the dis­ci­pline of sit­u­at­ing one­self in an­other’s imag­i­na­tion – die in the dig­i­tal do­main.</p>
    <p>The­atri­cal­ity trans­lates both beau­ti­fully and ter­ri­bly onto the small screen.</p>
    <p>I thought about this re­cently af­ter binge-watch­ing Crim­i­nal on Net­flix. For some rea­son, my</p>
    <p>Net­flix ac­count opened with sea­son two rather than sea­son one. But it was a serendip­i­tous be­gin­ning be­cause the guest star was the in­com­pa­ra­ble So­phie Okonedo.</p>
    <p>I be­came a fan of this as­tound­ing ac­tress in 1999 when I watched her as a trag­i­cally self-aware Cres­sida in a Trevor Nunn pro­duc­tion of Shake­speare’s Troilus And Cres­sida at the Na­tional The­atre.</p>
    <p>Her in­tel­li­gence, both in­tel­lec­tual and emo­tional, as an ac­tress blew me away and she brought all of that to bear on her role in Crim­i­nal.</p>
    <p>Ju­lia Bryce starts off as a frumpy, ag­grieved house­wife, ner­vously lean­ing into the mi­cro­phone as her in­ter­view with De­tec­tive Con­sta­ble Vanessa Mor­gan (played by Rochenda San­dall) be­gins.</p>
    <p>But there are hints of some­thing else brew­ing be­neath that stereo­typed ex­te­rior. Okonedo pulls off these sug­ges­tions mag­nif­i­cently, with slightly sharper tones of voice when an­swer­ing a seem­ingly in­nocu­ous ques­tion, with looks that sug­gest re­ac­tions be­yond the pale.</p>
    <p>Her ev­ery fa­cial twitch was cap­tured by mul­ti­ple close-ups – I have never seen such tight close-ups used so lib­er­ally in a TV show. Then again, not ev­ery ac­tor can carry such mi­cro­scopic ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>It is a mas­ter­class in act­ing, seen up close and per­sonal.</p>
    <p>Af­ter that episode, I was hooked. I have since watched all the UK episodes, as well as the Span­ish, French and Ger­man ver­sions. The premise of the se­ries is sim­ple: A ro­tat­ing ros­ter of peo­ple come into a po­lice in­ter­ro­ga­tion room and, dur­ing the course of an episode, var­i­ous se­crets un­ravel and crim­i­nal in­tent and/or en­ter­prises are un­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Given the craze in re­cent years for elab­o­rate CGI-ed fan­tasy sto­ries, Crim­i­nal is down­right miserly in its stag­ing. The set, used for all the se­ries re­gard­less of ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion, com­prises an in­ter­ro­ga­tion room, a view­ing room, both of which open to a cor­ri­dor and an anony­mously mod­ern lobby with cof­fee ma­chines, a stair­case and a view of sky­scrapers that could fit in any big city.</p>
    <p>What the show re­lies on for oomph is sharp writ­ing and su­perb act­ing. It was like watch­ing a se­ries of short plays. In fact, one could trans­plant ev­ery episode onto a stage with no loss to story. In an in­ter­view with Va­ri­ety, a trade pub­li­ca­tion, Okonedo said one rea­son why she ac­cepted the role was that it felt like “a bit of a two-han­der”.</p>
    <p>While I’m not about to step into the whole aca­demic quag­mire about def­i­ni­tions of the­atri­cal­ity, there are el­e­ments in this show that even non-the­atre­go­ers will recog­nise as the­atri­cal.</p>
    <p>When the­atre is stripped to the bare bones, it is es­sen­tially words on a page and ac­tors on a stage. The Net­flix se­ries borrows this con­ceit and turns it into a demon­stra­tion of the power of these two cen­tral com­po­nents of per­for­mance. No need for CGI dragons or ex­plicit sex and vi­o­lence. Just two ac­tors sit­ting in a room and talk­ing. Which is what Crim­i­nal thrives on.</p>
    <p>Even the cam­er­a­work is fairly ba­sic with straight­for­ward fram­ing, medium and close-up shots, and very few cam­era move­ments.</p>
    <p>The se­ries even (mostly) fits the clas­si­cal uni­ties, the the­ory of drama which dic­tates that a tragedy should fol­low the uni­ties of ac­tion, time and place.</p>
    <p>Yet, even as I recog­nised that the strengths of this show de­rived from the­atri­cal el­e­ments, I won­dered why ac­tual the­atre plays fail mis­er­ably trans­planted lock, stock and bar­rel into the screen for­mat.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, I have both cel­e­brated and be­moaned the avalanche of dig­i­tal screen­ings of stage pro­duc­tions. Cel­e­brated the op­por­tu­nity to still be able to watch shows and be­moaned the in­abil­ity of the small screen to truly cap­ture the magic of live the­atre.</p>
    <p>The el­e­ments of the­atre that make it so elec­tric to ex­pe­ri­ence in a dark hall with ac­tual ac­tors on a stage – the in­ti­macy of phys­i­cal pres­ence, the peren­nial threat of things go­ing wrong, the dis­ci­pline of sit­u­at­ing one­self in an­other’s imag­i­na­tion – die in the dig­i­tal do­main. It is the di­vorc­ing of the­atre from the real world that kills a play.</p>
    <p>There is also the dou­ble abyss of the prosce­nium arch and the screen bar­rier. Even in an ac­tual the­atre, if it is poorly con­fig­ured, the en­ergy of a stage pro­duc­tion can die. Kal­lang The­atre, for ex­am­ple, which was built as a cinema but con­verted into a the­atre. The only pro­duc­tion I have seen in there pow­er­ful enough to reach the nose-bleed sec­tions in the up­per tiers was Ni­na­gawa’s Mac­beth. Ev­ery­thing else dies if you sit any fur­ther than Row N.</p>
    <p>But even sit­ting in the cheap seats is prefer­able to watch­ing the­atre de­canted through the lens of a cam­era. There has been a stam­pede to broad­cast dig­i­tal con­tent dur­ing the pan­demic as the­atre com­pa­nies strug­gle to stay in touch with their au­di­ences while venues re­main closed.</p>
    <p>But the­atre, like hu­man be­ings, is a so­cial en­deav­our and ex­pe­ri­ence. Dig­i­tal con­tent can be ter­rific when it is made for the medium. But the­atre con­tent sel­dom sur­vives the mi­gra­tion if it is not dras­ti­cally over­hauled.</p>
    <p>The best the­atre I have seen on­line is con­tent that has been re­shaped fun­da­men­tally for dig­i­tal de­liv­ery. Jo Tan’s King, for ex­am­ple, is staged and edited like a film and it still has that fizz of live per­for­mance be­cause it was per­formed live for the live-stream pre­miere. The­atre com­pany Com­plicite’s as­ton­ish­ing The En­counter, Si­mon McBur­ney’s one-man show, was a tour de force of sound de­sign which smoothed over the dig­i­tal tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>But these shows had the ben­e­fit of ex­perts na­tive to the broad­cast medium. In the case of King, it was film-maker Jas­mine Ng who found a screen-friendly way to stage the script. In The En­counter, it was the sound de­sign of Gareth Fry and Pete Malkin that al­lowed the story to lit­er­ally get in­side the au­di­ence’s head.</p>
    <p>But these two are the ex­cep­tions that prove the rule: The­atre can­not be re­duced to the gog­gle box. And I, for one, can­not wait to get back into the the­atre to watch per­for­mances live again.</p>
