    <p>TU­NIS • A Tunisian man has pieced to­gether bits of a lo­cal se­cret linked to an­cient em­per­ors: how to make a prized pur­ple dye us­ing the guts of a sea snail.</p>
    <p>“At the be­gin­ning, I didn’t know where to start,” said Mr Mo­hamed Ghas­sen Nouira, who heads a con­sult­ing firm. “I would crush the whole shell and try to un­der­stand how this small ma­rine an­i­mal re­leased such a pre­cious colour.”</p>
    <p>Now, af­ter years of trial and er­ror – and af­ter get­ting used to the foul stench – he uses a ham­mer and small stone mor­tar to care­fully break open the spiny murex shells.</p>
    <p>What hap­pens next is part of a se­cret guarded so closely, it dis­ap­peared hun­dreds of years ago.</p>
    <p>A sym­bol of power and pres­tige, the cel­e­brated colour was tra­di­tion­ally used for royal and im­pe­rial robes.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion of the dye was among the main sources of wealth for the an­cient Phoeni­cians, and then the Carthagini­an and Ro­man em­pires, said Mr Ali Drine, who heads the re­search di­vi­sion of Tu­nisia’s Na­tional Her­itage In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try was “un­der the con­trol of the em­per­ors be­cause it brought a lot of money to the im­pe­rial cof­fers”, he said.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2007 on a Tunisian beach, Mr Nouira found a shell re­leas­ing a pur­plish red colour, re­mind­ing him of some­thing he had learnt in his­tory class at school.</p>
    <p>He bought more shells from lo­cal fish­er­men and set out ex­per­i­ment­ing in an old out­door kitchen at his father’s house, which he still uses as a work­shop.</p>
    <p>SE­CRET KNOW-HOW</p>
    <p>“Ex­perts in dye­ing, ar­chae­ol­ogy and his­tory, as well as chem­istry, helped and en­cour­aged me, but no­body knew the tech­nique,” Mr Nouira said.</p>
    <p>No his­tor­i­cal doc­u­ments clearly de­tail the pro­duc­tion meth­ods for the pur­ple pig­ment, Mr Drine said.</p>
    <p>“Maybe be­cause the ar­ti­sans did not want to di­vulge the secrets of their know-how, or they were afraid to be­cause the pro­duc­tion of pur­ple was di­rectly as­so­ci­ated with the em­per­ors, who tol­er­ated no ri­valry,” he said.</p>
    <p>The only clues for un­earthing the tech­niques lie in ar­chae­o­log­i­cal sites and arte­facts in the Mediter­ranean, par­tic­u­larly in Tyre in south­ern Le­banon, and Men­inx, on the coast of Tu­nisia’s Djerba is­land.</p>
    <p>Phoeni­cians from Tyre set down the foun­da­tions of what would be­come the Carthagini­an em­pire on the Tunisian coasts.</p>
    <p>Also known as Tyr­ian pur­ple, the pig­ment is still highly val­ued to­day and is pro­duced by just a hand­ful of peo­ple around the world. They in­clude a German painter and a Ja­panese en­thu­si­ast, each with their own se­cret tech­niques.</p>
    <p>Among the buy­ers are col­lec­tors, artists and re­searchers. The dye can cost US$2,800 (S$3,860) a gram from some Euro­pean traders, and prices can go up to US$4,000, Mr Nouira said.</p>
    <p>He added that he had pro­duced sev­eral dozen grams of the pure pur­ple dye, which he sells in­ter­na­tion­ally for more mod­est prices.</p>
    <p>NO OR­DI­NARY RECIPE</p>
    <p>Mr Nouira said that when he sought help from other dye-mak­ers, one told him bluntly: “It’s not a cook­ing recipe to be passed around.”</p>
    <p>“That made me even more de­ter­mined. It drove me to read more and re­dou­ble my ef­forts,” he said.</p>
    <p>In a wooden box where he keeps his stock, rang­ing from in­digo blue to vi­o­let, Mr Nouira care­fully guards a dye sam­ple from 2009 – a “dear me­mento of my first suc­cess”.</p>
    <p>“I im­proved my meth­ods un­til I found the right tech­nique and mas­tered it from 2013 to 2014,” he said.</p>
    <p>To ob­tain one gram of pure pur­ple dye, Mr Nouira said he had to shell 100kg of murex, a task that takes him two week­ends.</p>
    <p>He washes the ma­rine snails, sorts them by species and size, and breaks the up­per part of the shells to ex­tract the gland that, af­ter ox­i­di­s­a­tion, pro­duces the pur­ple colour.</p>
    <p>Mr Nouira said his great­est wish was to see his work ex­hib­ited in Tunisian mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>“Pur­ple has great tourist po­ten­tial,” he said, ex­press­ing a de­sire to one day also con­duct work­shops. But he lamented what he said was the au­thor­i­ties’ lack of in­ter­est in the craft.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, he is keep­ing his trade secrets close and hopes to pass them on to his chil­dren. “I’m very sat­is­fied, and I’m also proud to have re­vived some­thing re­lated to our Carthagini­an an­ces­tors,” he said.</p>
