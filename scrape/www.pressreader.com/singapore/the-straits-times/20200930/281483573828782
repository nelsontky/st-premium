    <p>Thirty-two din­ers will be fined $300 each for breach­ing Covid-19 mea­sures at food and bev­er­age out­lets. They were taken to task for not wear­ing a mask promptly after eat­ing or drink­ing, sit­ting in groups of more than five and min­gling with din­ers at other ta­bles.</p>
    <p>Eight F&B out­lets have also been or­dered to close and 14 oth­ers fined be­tween $1,000 and $2,000, said the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) in an up­date yesterday.</p>
    <p>The out­lets or­dered to close in­clude Siam Square Mookata in Pung­gol Point Road, the Tan­jong Pa­gar branch of Korean fried chicken chain Chicken Up, and Cafe de Muse in Shaw House.</p>
    <p>Com­mon of­fences in­cluded the sale and con­sump­tion of al­co­hol after 10.30pm and din­ers in­ter­min­gling across mul­ti­ple ta­bles.</p>
    <p>A Restau­rant As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore spokesman said most cus­tomers do wear masks in restau­rants and re­move them only when food and drinks are served.</p>
    <p>He added that restau­rants face chal­lenges in en­sur­ing din­ers fol­low safe man­age­ment mea­sures, es­pe­cially if they have a short­age of man­power.</p>
    <p>Thirty-two din­ers will be fined $300 each for flout­ing Covid-19 rules at food and bev­er­age out­lets, such as not wear­ing masks promptly after eat­ing or drink­ing, in­ter­min­gling be­tween ta­bles, as well as sit­ting in groups of more than five din­ers.</p>
    <p>Eight more F&B out­lets have been or­dered to close for 10 days, and 14 out­lets were also fined, said the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) yesterday.</p>
    <p>MSE warned that the Govern­ment will con­tinue to step up en­force­ment checks at F&B out­lets “to en­sure that they re­main safe spa­ces for all” and re­minded din­ers to be so­cially re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Agen­cies will not hes­i­tate to take en­force­ment ac­tion against both pa­trons and premises that do not com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures,” the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>This comes after the Govern­ment said on Sept 9 that F&B out­lets and din­ers who breach safe man­age­ment mea­sures will be pe­nalised, even for the first of­fence, in­stead of just re­ceiv­ing a warn­ing.</p>
    <p>In yesterday’s up­date, MSE said that among the eight er­rant F&B out­lets or­dered to close are Siam Square Mookata in Pung­gol Point Road, the Tan­jong Pa­gar branch of Korean fried chicken chain Chicken Up and Cafe de Muse at Shaw House.</p>
    <p>Some com­mon breaches found at the eight out­lets in­cluded the sale and con­sump­tion of al­co­hol after 10.30pm and din­ers across mul­ti­ple ta­bles in­ter­min­gling with one another and shar­ing food.</p>
    <p>Another 14 out­lets were fined for breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures, with 13 fined $1,000 and one – a re­peat of­fender – fined $2,000.</p>
    <p>Some of­fences com­mit­ted by th­ese out­lets were ad­mit­ting and seat­ing groups of more than five to­gether and not en­sur­ing that food han­dlers wore their masks prop­erly.</p>
    <p>MSE said govern­ment agen­cies con­ducted ad­di­tional in­spec­tions on 240 F&B out­lets on Fri­day and Satur­day last week. Of th­ese, 15 were found to have breached safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Agen­cies are re­view­ing the breaches and the ap­pro­pri­ate en­force­ment ac­tion to be taken, in­clud­ing tem­po­rary clo­sure of the out­lets and is­su­ing fines.</p>
    <p>De­spite some din­ers not mask­ing up, a Restau­rant As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore spokesman said most cus­tomers wear masks in restau­rants and re­move them only when food and drinks are served.</p>
    <p>Most of those who for­get to put on their masks after meals will com­ply when re­minded.</p>
    <p>But as “servers are of­ten busy mak­ing sure or­ders are taken and meals are served on time, there may be gaps in time be­tween checks and re­mind­ing din­ers to wear their masks after they com­plete their meals”, he said.</p>
    <p>For en­tre­pre­neur Chen Ji­axin, 29, it is not un­com­mon to see din­ers talk­ing to one another with­out masks on after fin­ish­ing their meals.</p>
    <p>“I think peo­ple are start­ing to get com­pla­cent now that com­mu­nity cases are low,” she said.</p>
    <p>“While we should not let our guard down, I can see why peo­ple (don’t mask up right) after their meal be­cause of the dis­com­fort of talk­ing with a mask on.”</p>
