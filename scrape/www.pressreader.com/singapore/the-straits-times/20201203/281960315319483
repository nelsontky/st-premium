    <p>When gov­ern­ments need to move fast to re­spond to crises and ur­gently de­velop scal­able so­lu­tions, they turn to in­dus­try. In the past months, we have seen a her­culean ef­fort un­der­taken by the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try. Work­ing with re­search in­sti­tu­tions, they have come for­ward with Covid-19 can­di­date vac­cines in what has been record time.</p>
    <p>It was not po­lit­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions or in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions that were equipped to do this. It was the power of in­dus­try that un­der­took the ur­gent re­search and devel­op­ment needed to pro­duce large-scale so­lu­tions for a mas­sive global chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Faced with a sim­i­larly tough chal­lenge, the de­car­bon­i­sa­tion of ship­ping, in­dus­try must again step for­ward to find so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional ship­ping is key to the global econ­omy, trans­port­ing about 90 per cent of global trade vol­umes. Mov­ing these vi­tal goods re­quires four mil­lion bar­rels of oil a day, or 4 per cent of global oil pro­duc­tion, the equiv­a­lent of over a third of the daily pro­duc­tion of</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>The sheer size and scale of to­day’s ships and the daily vol­ume of trade they trans­port re­quire a colos­sal power in­put. The en­ergy used by a typ­i­cal large ves­sel cross­ing the ocean could pro­vide power for 50,000 homes.</p>
    <p>The ship­ping in­dus­try pro­duces 0.9 gi­ga­tonne of car­bon diox­ide (CO2) – two per cent of the global econ­omy’s to­tal emis­sions – sim­i­lar to aviation but less than the 2.4 gi­ga­tonnes from the global road trans­porta­tion sec­tor. While too high, ship­ping’s car­bon emis­sions are much lower than some other key in­dus­tries such as the global ce­ment in­dus­try that pro­duces more than dou­ble the amount of CO2.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment and ship­ping in­dus­try are on the right track, do­ing their part in help­ing to ad­dress this chal­lenge. The Sin­ga­pore Mar­itime Foun­da­tion, sup­ported by the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, es­tab­lished a 27-mem­ber In­ter­na­tional Ad­vi­sory Panel on Mar­itime De­car­bon­i­sa­tion (IAP) in July this year, with the aim to de­velop path­ways to sup­port the lo­cal ship­ping in­dus­try’s de­car­bon­i­sa­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the whole in­dus­try recog­nises that it needs to end its de­pen­dence on fos­sil fuels, but there are mul­ti­ple hur­dles to be</p>
    <p>over­come be­fore full de­car­bon­i­sa­tion can be achieved. New fuels will need to be de­vel­oped along with novel propul­sion sys­tems, up­graded ves­sels and an en­tirely new global re­fu­elling net­work.</p>
    <p>To de­velop these new tech­nolo­gies at the speed needed to meet our com­mit­ments to de­car­bonise will re­quire a sim­i­larly mon­u­men­tal ef­fort as the one un­leashed to de­velop the can­di­date Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, zero-car­bon fuels and tech­nolo­gies do not ex­ist at the size and scale needed to catal­yse this rev­o­lu­tion. How­ever, there are sev­eral promis­ing po­ten­tial zero-car­bon fuels and tech­nolo­gies, in­clud­ing am­mo­nia, hy­dro­gen and elec­tric bat­ter­ies, but each of these poses spe­cific chal­lenges that re­quire a tremen­dous amount of R&D be­fore they can be­come com­mer­cially vi­able on a global ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Am­mo­nia and hy­dro­gen are less en­ergy-dense com­pared with oil, mean­ing that ships would need to con­sume up to five times as much fuel by vol­ume. If the global fleet all adopted green am­mo­nia fuel, for ex­am­ple, am­mo­nia pro­duc­tion would have to rise by 440 mil­lion tonnes – more than tre­ble the cur­rent out­put – re­quir­ing 750 gi­gawatts of re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>This means that ship­ping alone would con­sume 60 per cent of the world’s cur­rent re­new­able en­ergy pro­duc­tion of 2,537 gi­gawatts. The bat­tery chal­lenge is just as sig­nif­i­cant: A typ­i­cal con­tainer ves­sel would re­quire the power of 10,000 Tesla S85 bat­ter­ies ev­ery sin­gle day, mean­ing that it would need 70,000 bat­ter­ies to op­er­ate for a week.</p>
    <p>In or­der to ad­dress the mam­moth chal­lenge of de­car­bon­i­sa­tion, the in­dus­try has pro­posed cre­at­ing a US$5 bil­lion (S$6.7 bil­lion) R&D fund, paid for by a levy on marine fuels and to be over­seen by the In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion (IMO).</p>
    <p>The pro­posed R&D fund is the most pro­gres­sive and tan­gi­ble step that the in­dus­try has taken to re­alise a zero-emis­sion fu­ture. A fun­da­men­tal as­pect of the pro­posal is the es­tab­lish­ment of the In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Re­search and Devel­op­ment Board (IMRB), a non-government­al R&D or­gan­i­sa­tion that would be over­seen by IMO mem­ber states.</p>
    <p>The IMRB will be fi­nanced by ship­ping com­pa­nies world­wide via a manda­tory levy of US$2 per tonne of marine fuel pur­chased for con­sump­tion. This will gen­er­ate about US$5 bil­lion in core fund­ing over a 10-year pe­riod, giv­ing the IMRB all the sup­port it needs to de­velop and ad­vance zero-car­bon tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>As with the devel­op­ment of the vac­cine, the green light from gov­ern­ments can­not come soon enough. We wel­come IMO mem­ber states’ agree­ment dur­ing last month’s IMO en­vi­ron­ment com­mit­tee meet­ing to fur­ther con­sider the in­dus­try pro­posal for the devel­op­ment of the IMRB to over­see the cre­ation and use of the US$5 bil­lion R&D Fund.</p>
    <p>But to be clear, the in­dus­try needs an un­am­bigu­ous sig­nal. Mere con­sid­er­a­tion of the pro­posal is not enough. We need the pro­posal to be agreed by mem­ber states at the next IMO en­vi­ron­ment com­mit­tee meet­ing, sched­uled to take place in June next year, so we can take for­ward the cru­cial and com­pli­cated process of de­car­bon­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>At last month’s IMO meet­ing, mem­ber states all agreed on the ur­gent need for re­search and devel­op­ment. But some tried to link this pro­posal to other more in­tractable ne­go­ti­a­tions around mar­ket-based mea­sures, such as emis­sions trad­ing sys­tems. Some thought they could do it them­selves and some were con­cerned that the ex­tra US$2 per tonne of fuel pur­chased would dis­ad­van­tage their coun­try.</p>
    <p>The in­tro­duc­tion of the pro­posed R&D fund was the first step from in­dus­try to per­suade mem­ber states to agree on a con­crete path for­ward. It is not meant to be a mar­ket-based mea­sure but is a sim­ple pro­posal to drive in­no­va­tion and har­ness in­dus­try to do what it does best. The cli­mate cri­sis is a global is­sue, and the agree­ment of coun­tries is vi­tal to mit­i­gate the in­vest­ment risk of in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Fea­si­bil­ity stud­ies have found that it would take ap­prox­i­mately 10 years to de­velop a com­mer­cially vi­able zero-emis­sion fuel. But these projects can be kick-started only by an op­er­a­tional R&D fund, the pro­posal for which has al­ready taken the in­dus­try two years to de­velop. Should gov­ern­ments de­cide to de­lay or re­ject the pro­posal, there is a real risk of miss­ing the IMO 2050 com­mit­ment to re­duce emis­sions by 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>As United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res has of­ten ex­horted, in the bat­tle to cut car­bon emis­sions, the world ur­gently needs to in­crease the speed and scale of cli­mate so­lu­tions. We do not have time to waste. Gov­ern­ments should grasp this op­por­tu­nity to think glob­ally, in­stead of adding to red tape. In­stead of sti­fling in­dus­try, em­power it to speed up the search for in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions. It is what in­dus­try does best.</p>
