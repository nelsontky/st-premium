    <p>YAN­GON • Myan­mar has put most of Yan­gon prov­ince, home to its largest city, on lock­down for two weeks to con­tain a record surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions ahead of gen­eral elec­tions set for Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The strict stay-at-home or­der, which started yes­ter­day, bars more than one mem­ber of a fam­ily from ven­tur­ing out for shop­ping and curbs travel from Yan­gon town­ship to other cities ex­cept for es­sen­tial work. The guide­lines were is­sued on Sun­day by the na­tion’s Cen­tral Com­mit­tee on Covid-19 Con­trol.</p>
    <p>The lock­down or­ders also bar peo­ple go­ing on so­cial vis­its from the streets ex­cept those with prior ap­proval from the town­ship au­thor­i­ties, and limit ve­hi­cles to two pas­sen­gers, among other re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, all fac­to­ries – in­clud­ing cut­ting, mak­ing and pack­ing busi­nesses – must close from Thurs­day to Oct 7, and all peo­ple un­der quar­an­tine are sub­ject to a manda­tory one-week home iso­la­tion af­ter test­ing neg­a­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>With new coro­n­avirus cases surg­ing, the au­thor­i­ties have cut the quar­an­tine pe­riod at state fa­cil­i­ties to one week from two to make space for the care of pri­mary and se­condary con­tacts of in­fected peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health and Sports.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tial ser­vices such as bank­ing, health­care, petrol sta­tions and food out­lets will be al­lowed to op­er­ate as usual, it said.</p>
    <p>While pri­vate-sec­tor com­pa­nies and or­gan­i­sa­tions have been or­dered to ask em­ploy­ees to work from home, gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees are al­lowed to do so on ro­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>New cases jumped by 671 on Sun­day, a sin­gle-day record for Myan­mar since the na­tion of 54 mil­lion peo­ple first re­ported the virus out­break in late March, of­fi­cial data showed. The death toll rose by 11, tak­ing the to­tal to 94.</p>
    <p>Much of Yan­gon and Rakhine state, the epi­cen­tres of the na­tion’s out­break, had al­ready been un­der some kind of so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, with a ban on do­mes­tic travel im­posed from Sept 10.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar is racing to con­tain the out­break, with 5,805 Covid-19 cases as at yes­ter­day morn­ing, ahead of gen­eral elec­tions sched­uled for Nov 8. About two dozen po­lit­i­cal par­ties are call­ing for the vote to be post­poned due to the resur­gence in virus cases.</p>
