    <p>Gavin Lee has watched his side throw away win­ning po­si­tions in three of their last four games but the Tampines Rovers coach re­mains a pic­ture of calm as the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) sea­son reaches its cli­max.</p>
    <p>The Stags, who at the start of the month were four points clear, now trail lead­ers Al­birex Ni­igata by two with just four matches left.</p>
    <p>Round 11 is today and Tampines travel to face Hougang United know­ing a win and three points are crit­i­cal for their ti­tle chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Lee said: “We have made er­rors which we don’t typ­i­cally make, and we got pun­ished. Nat­u­rally, we are dis­ap­pointed, but we don’t spend time brood­ing over what could and should have been.</p>
    <p>“Many things can go wrong in foot­ball, and it is im­por­tant we re­main calm.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter keep­ing five clean sheets in their first six games, Tampines have con­ceded in their last four matches. In three of those, they took the lead against Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional, Balestier Khalsa and Tan­jong Pa­gar United, but ended up with just a draw which has cost them pre­cious points.</p>
    <p>Their top scorer Jor­dan Webb, with seven goals, was also sent off in their last game – a 2-2 draw against Tan­jong Pa­gar – for abus­ing the ref­eree, and will miss two matches.</p>
    <p>But Lee, who led Tampines to Sin­ga­pore Cup glory last year, in­sists he would rather look for so­lu­tions than scape­goats.</p>
    <p>“We have Boris Ko­pi­tovic (six goals) who not only scores goals, but does very well for us in de­fence and tran­si­tion, and we also have Tau­fik Su­parno and Fazrul Nawaz (nei­ther have scored this sea­son),” he said.</p>
    <p>Hougang, who are fifth in the stand­ings, won their ear­lier en­counter 2-1 last month by de­fend­ing deep but Lee is adamant he will per­sist with the pa­tient and prob­ing pos­ses­sion-based foot­ball his Stags are known for.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old also de­fended his se­lec­tion of young­sters – full­backs An­drew Aw Yong and Ryaan Sanizal are 17 and 18 re­spec­tively – and backed them to cope with the pres­sure dur­ing the most im­por­tant part of the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Lee said: “The three re­sults are a small sam­ple size and it is un­fair to ex­trap­o­late them and negate the good work we have done for the past two years.</p>
    <p>“We will trust the process be­cause it has given us our iden­tity and brought us to where we are now. The process doesn’t guar­an­tee re­sults, but through pay­ing at­ten­tion to what we be­lieve in and ap­pli­ca­tion, we will have a bet­ter chance of win­ning.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery team have the right to play the style they want, it’s our job to solve the prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>At least their des­tiny is in their hands. Tampines’ last four games are against Hougang, Al­birex, third-placed Lion City Sailors and fourth-placed Gey­lang and if they win all four, they will be crowned cham­pi­ons and qual­ify for next sea­son’s AFC Cham­pi­ons League group stage.</p>
    <p>Tampines chair­man Des­mond Ong, 51, was un­wa­ver­ing in his sup­port for Lee. The lawyer said: “Gavin hasn’t taught me how to lawyer, and I won’t teach him how to coach. Now is not the time to get up­set, and let’s face it, Gey­lang and Tan­jong Pa­gar’s equalis­ers were stun­ners.</p>
    <p>“From a foot­ball point of view, it is great for Sin­ga­pore foot­ball to have such un­pre­dictabil­ity and a grand­stand fin­ish to the end of the sea­son. Per­son­ally, I’m more ex­cited about try­ing to qual­ify for the Cham­pi­ons League; win­ning the league would be a bonus.</p>
    <p>“As a club, we want to de­velop play­ers and coaches, and build an iden­tity. The coach and the boys have got­ten us so far, and I am de­ter­mined to keep faith in them.”</p>
