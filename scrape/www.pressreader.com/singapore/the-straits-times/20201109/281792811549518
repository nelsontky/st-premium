    <p>All Athira Su­jatha Rad­hakr­ish­nan, 33, and Shameem P., 34, wanted for their wed­ding re­cep­tion last De­cem­ber was a fun party with friends and fam­ily. After all, fol­low­ing some ini­tial reser­va­tions, Ms Rad­hakr­ish­nan’s Hindu par­ents and Mr Shameem’s Mus­lim par­ents had even­tu­ally sup­ported the cou­ple’s de­ci­sion to marry.</p>
    <p>Both Ms Rad­hakr­ish­nan, a pub­lic pol­icy pro­fes­sional, and Mr Shameem, a start-up con­sul­tant, are not reli­gious “so there was no con­ver­sa­tion about con­ver­sion”, Ms Rad­hakr­ish­nan said.</p>
    <p>But be­cause they were from dif­fer­ent faiths, the cou­ple had to ap­ply for a civil union un­der In­dia’s Spe­cial Mar­riage Act. In ac­cor­dance with the law, their ap­pli­ca­tion was put on the lo­cal mar­riage reg­is­trar of­fice’s no­tice board for 30 days.</p>
    <p>A week later, a stranger tagged Mr Shameem in a Face­book post on their ap­pli­ca­tion, which also in­cluded their pho­tos and home ad­dresses. The post at­tracted hate­ful com­ments and, in half an hour, it was shared 150 times.</p>
    <p>“Two weeks later, my mum sent me a (for­warded) What­sApp (mes­sage) in Malay­alam which read, ‘In this month, around 108 Hindu women have been trapped by Love Ji­hadis.’ It was a doc­u­ment with around 125 ap­pli­ca­tions filed in Ker­ala un­der the Spe­cial Mar­riage Act, in­clud­ing mine,” said Ms Rad­hakr­ish­nan.</p>
    <p>Although up­set and scared, the cou­ple fo­cused on plan­ning for their wed­ding. They reg­is­tered their mar­riage with­out trou­ble and had a re­cep­tion with 250 guests on Dec 26 last year.</p>
    <p>In June, Ms Rad­hakr­ish­nan saw the daugh­ter of the Ker­ala Chief Min­is­ter be­ing trolled on­line for mar­ry­ing a Mus­lim.</p>
    <p>She said: “If even the min­is­ter’s daugh­ter is not spared, what about less-priv­i­leged women? I de­cided to speak up against this nau­se­at­ing hate and venom.”</p>
    <p>She wrote about her ex­pe­ri­ence on Face­book and re­ceived mes­sages from many other cou­ples about how their per­sonal de­tails had also been shared on­line.</p>
    <p>Ms Rad­hakr­ish­nan tagged Ker­ala’s state leg­is­la­tors in her post, de­mand­ing ac­tion. Fi­nally, Pub­lic Works min­is­ter G. Sud­hakaran in­structed all in­ter-faith mar­riage ap­pli­ca­tions to be re­moved from the govern­ment web­site.</p>
    <p>“Those who talk about ‘love ji­had’ think all Mus­lim men are po­ten­tial frauds or ter­ror­ists. They think a woman is too stupid to de­cide for her­self and needs sav­ing. Enough of this Is­lam­o­pho­bia and misog­yny,” Ms Rad­hakr­ish­nan added.</p>
    <p>In the mid­dle of last month, she pe­ti­tioned the coun­try’s Supreme Court to have the “dis­crim­i­na­tory” 30-day rule re­moved as a vi­o­la­tion of pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>She said: “Hindu mar­riage laws and Mus­lim mar­riage laws al­low two con­sent­ing adults to marry. So why should two con­sent­ing adults who want to con­tinue in their sep­a­rate re­li­gions be put through so much trou­ble?”</p>
