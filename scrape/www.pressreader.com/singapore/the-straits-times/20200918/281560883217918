    <p>The con­struc­tion sec­tor is poised to take a $10 bil­lion hit this year, with de­mand drop­ping and projects get­ting pushed back in the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic. The pro­jected con­struc­tion de­mand for this year has been re­vised to be­tween $18 bil­lion and $23 bil­lion fol­low­ing a mid-year re­view.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion sec­tor is poised to take a $10 bil­lion hit this year, with de­mand drop­ping and projects get­ting pushed back in the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The two-month-long cir­cuit breaker that brought con­struc­tion work to a halt, cou­pled with some 180,000 for­eign con­struc­tion work­ers who were put on stay­home no­tice, has left its im­print on the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the pro­jected con­struc­tion de­mand for this year has been re­vised to be­tween $18 bil­lion and $23 bil­lion fol­low­ing a midyear re­view, the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA) said yes­ter­day. This is sharply down from BCA’s Jan­uary fore­cast of $28 bil­lion to $33 bil­lion for the year.</p>
    <p>The re­vi­sion is largely due to a drop in pri­vate-sec­tor con­tracts, which are ex­pected to to­tal $7 bil­lion to $9 bil­lion this year. Last year, they were worth $14.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Some pub­lic-sec­tor projects have also been post­poned from this year to next year as con­trac­tors and sup­pli­ers have asked for more time to as­sess the im­pact of Covid-19 on re­source man­age­ment and project im­ple­men­ta­tion time­lines, said BCA.</p>
    <p>This year’s fore­cast for public­sec­tor con­tracts is $11 bil­lion to $14 bil­lion – down from $19 bil­lion last year. Con­struc­tion on projects such as Changi Air­port’s Ter­mi­nal 5 has been halted.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion sec­tor has been one of the hardest-hit in­dus­tries amid the fall­out from the pan­demic, con­tract­ing 97.1 per cent from the first to the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>It also saw one of the largest de­clines in em­ploy­ment – by 13,600 work­ers, sec­ond to only the food and bev­er­age ser­vices sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, BCA said con­struc­tion de­mand is ex­pected to re­cover to some ex­tent from next year.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic res­i­den­tial devel­op­ments and up­grad­ing works, devel­op­ments in the Jurong Lake District, con­struc­tion of new health­care fa­cil­i­ties and var­i­ous in­fra­struc­ture projects such as the con­struc­tion of the Cross Is­land MRT line will sup­port de­mand.</p>
    <p>BCA noted it is im­por­tant that the con­struc­tion in­dus­try re­mains vig­i­lant to prevent a resur­gence of Covid-19 cases, which could bring the sec­tor to a halt again.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Na­tional Devel­op­ment Desmond Lee said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that the con­struc­tion in­dus­try has re­alised the need to build up ca­pa­bil­ity for sus­tain­able busi­ness devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>He noted that a new plan­ning and co­or­di­na­tion regime for busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity, and the role of tech­nol­ogy and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion to build up in­dus­try re­silience in the long run, were some is­sues raised by par­tic­i­pants at a lead­er­ship we­bi­nar coor­gan­ised by BCA and the Con­struc­tion In­dus­try Joint Com­mit­tee on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“In spite of the restart, the in­dus­try still faces chal­lenges,” Mr Lee said. “The sil­ver lin­ing is that we ex­pect de­mand to pick up to some ex­tent next year, and there will be a pipe­line of pub­lic-sec­tor projects com­ing on stream next year.”</p>
    <p>Straits Con­struc­tion ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Ken­neth Loo said the $10 bil­lion down­ward re­vi­sion was not un­ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“There was no work for around four months dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and be­fore the dorms were cleared, so the onethird drop is quite re­flec­tive of these months,” he added.</p>
    <p>Team­build Engi­neer­ing and Con­struc­tion ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Johnny Lim feels con­struc­tion will pick up as de­mand picks up. Home sales were ro­bust last month and de­vel­op­ers may look for land more ag­gres­sively, he said, adding: “It is a chicken-and-egg thing.”</p>
