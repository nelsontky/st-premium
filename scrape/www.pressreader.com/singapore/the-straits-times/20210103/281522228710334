    <p>Some­one shoved me from be­hind with enough force to make me stag­ger, but I man­aged to not fall on my face. Or so I thought.</p>
    <p>I turned around to see whom I had of­fended just by ex­ist­ing, and found my­self in a sur­real Trans­form­ers-like mo­ment: It was a car which “shoved” me.</p>
    <p>I had just been hit ex­tremely slowly by a car.</p>
    <p>No, it didn’t trans­form into an an­gry De­cep­ti­con and blast me out of ex­is­tence (the Trans­form­ers movie se­ries was cen­tred on ro­bots which could turn into ve­hi­cles, among other things).</p>
    <p>A pas­sen­ger in­stead opened the door, and ges­tic­u­lated and spoke an­i­mat­edly. I sort of blanked out. I wouldn’t have been sur­prised if I was be­ing scolded, but the aun­tie had a guilty look on her face, so she was per­haps apol­o­gis­ing.</p>
    <p>The driver just sat there.</p>
    <p>I had been walk­ing on the ex­treme left side of a road in a park­ing area for a few me­tres, since it was the only way I – and other pedes­tri­ans – could get to the foot­path. The car had no busi­ness get­ting so close to us.</p>
    <p>What I learnt was that even a “gen­tle” tap from a car could have sent a pedes­trian tum­bling over.</p>
    <p>I kept think­ing about how lucky it was that it wasn’t an elderly per­son or some­one un­steady on her feet who was bumped. What if it had been a small child, who would have been harder to spot, and the car kept go­ing over her?</p>
    <p>What I mulled over was the amount of (horse) power put into the hands of some peo­ple who per­haps just passed their driv­ing tests, or who were al­lowed to con­tinue driv­ing based on tests they passed years ago.</p>
    <p>While many get bet­ter at driv­ing, surely some have had their skills or sight de­te­ri­o­rate over the years, or their lev­els of con­cen­tra­tion fall as the num­ber of dis­trac­tions or tech toys grew in­side the car?</p>
    <p>CAR CO­COON</p>
    <p>Car rides can be like a por­ta­ble home away from home. I love how you can be co­cooned from the heat, dust and noise of the out­side world.</p>
    <p>The seat cra­dles your body, and the air-con­di­tion­ing is sh­iok on a hot Sin­ga­pore day. The mu­sic – hyp­notic elec­tron­ica or a swoon­ing clas­si­cal move­ment – is rock­ing and you’re rolling with a drink to sip as the world goes by.</p>
    <p>Throw in a con­ver­sa­tion with pas­sen­gers or on the phone, and surely the ran­dom-ac­cess mem­ory of the driver is nearly used up. How many tasks can a per­son do well at the same time?</p>
    <p>What I learnt was that be­yond the oc­ca­sional slips in at­ten­tion, the comfy co­coon could also numb driv­ers to how vul­ner­a­ble pedes­tri­ans are.</p>
    <p>CAR CRAZY</p>
    <p>I have taken rides with driv­ers who are so calm out­side the car, but once they are be­hind the wheel, the world in front of the wind­screen turns into a jacked-up video game.</p>
    <p>The hu­man­ity of pedes­tri­ans fades away, and they are seen as ob­sta­cles to be swat­ted aside. There was one such in­stance when we were in no hurry to get to our des­ti­na­tion, but one driver lit­er­ally did fly-swat­ting move­ments while yelling: “Get out of the way! Hurry! Go away!”</p>
    <p>Other road users are not spared. Cy­clists are seen as en­ti­tled pests.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor­cy­clists are seen as mo­torised, en­ti­tled pests.</p>
    <p>Other driv­ers are seen as big­ger, mo­torised, en­ti­tled pests.</p>
    <p>One other­wise very kind per­son gig­gled over speed­ing up to cut off pedes­tri­ans about to use the ze­bra cross­ing be­cause, you know, who wants to wait a few sec­onds for them to walk across the road.</p>
    <p>What I learnt was that there’s some­thing about putting a ma­chine with a fair bit of horse­power in the hands of some peo­ple which turns them from dig­ni­fied Au­to­bots into rag­ing De­cep­ti­cons (Trans­form­ers good guys and bad­dies, re­spec­tively).</p>
    <p>CAR CRIME</p>
    <p>A driver once de­lib­er­ately ac­cel­er­ated to­wards me as I was cross­ing the road af­ter mid­night some time ago. It was at a pedes­trian cross­ing with the traf­fic lights in my favour, and the car was at a dis­cre­tionary right turn at the in­ter­sec­tion.</p>
    <p>The driver, us­ing his amaz­ing dis­cre­tion, sped up to­wards me. The pas­sen­gers leaned out of the win­dows, and laughed and whooped at me as the car was al­most upon me.</p>
    <p>I froze, then dashed out of the way.</p>
    <p>What I learnt was that I knew a de­cent num­ber of colour­ful Chi­nese dialect swear words.</p>
    <p>CAR CREEP</p>
    <p>What I learnt was that ev­ery cen­time­tre gained is an epic vic­tory to some driv­ers.</p>
    <p>If a ve­hi­cle in front left an ex­tra me­tre of a gap, it would be a crime pun­ish­able by honk­ing, Hokkien phrases and hand ges­tures.</p>
    <p>Does creep­ing to within half a me­tre of pedes­tri­ans save driv­ers a big amount of time? Is there a bumper sticker which says, “Crept half a me­tre ahead: Life goals”?</p>
    <p>Was that why the driver nosed his car so close to me and other pedes­tri­ans in that park­ing area?</p>
    <p>CAR CARE</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spec­trum, it’s mov­ing how many driv­ers can com­mu­ni­cate kind­ness via a chunk of metal.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, I have re­peat­edly been shown care and con­sid­er­a­tion by driv­ers who refuse to move their cars un­til other pedes­tri­ans and I have hur­ried across. We wave at one another.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, a driver stopped his van prob­a­bly 5m away for me to cross a road. He got an ap­pre­cia­tive wave and bow from me.</p>
    <p>In In­di­ana in the United States, I was the only pedes­trian wait­ing at a cross­roads for cars to get clear be­fore I walked as there were no traf­fic lights. Be­ing used to im­pa­tient driv­ers, I ex­pe­ri­enced a sur­real mo­ment when all the cars from dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions re­fused to budge un­til I made my cross­ing.</p>
    <p>In that mo­ment, in the still­ness, sounds faded away and the sun­shine metaphor­i­cally burst through the clouds for me as I walked grate­fully and in awe of their ex­cel­lent car man­ners.</p>
    <p>TRANS­FORM TESTS</p>
    <p>Can we get more thought­ful driv­ers than we have now?</p>
    <p>If driv­ing tests in Sin­ga­pore are al­ready not easy to pass, per­haps they should get even more dif­fi­cult to pass. Stress-test driv­ers with real-life pound­ing mu­sic and mul­ti­ple con­ver­sa­tions? Get driv­ers to walk a mile in pedes­tri­ans’ shoes as part of a prac­ti­cal ethics test?</p>
    <p>Reg­u­larly retest to weed out the bad and mad driv­ers to get far fewer but far more skilled, eth­i­cal driv­ers. The side ef­fect of fewer cars on the road should be in line with the goal of go­ing car-lite in Sin­ga­pore, right?</p>
    <p>But pedes­tri­ans, please re­mem­ber your road man­ners too – by not be­ing phone zom­bies, or strut­ting around like it’s your “grand­fa­ther’s road”. Re­mem­ber how it’s like to be in­side a car – driv­ers may be lost in their com­fort­able co­coon or rag­ing in a “de­stroy pedes­tri­ans” game. Walk de­fen­sively and play your part to keep ev­ery­one safe.</p>
    <p>What I learnt is there is hope if enough driv­ers can switch gears from be­ing rag­ing road ma­chines to be­ing more pro­tec­tive, like the pop­u­lar Trans­form­ers char­ac­ter, Bum­ble­bee.</p>
    <p>Driv­ers en­joy­ing the power of their cars can, at the same time, wield it with care.</p>
    <p>Now, if only Bum­ble­bee is real – I wouldn’t mind him giv­ing me a gen­tle shove as a hello.</p>
