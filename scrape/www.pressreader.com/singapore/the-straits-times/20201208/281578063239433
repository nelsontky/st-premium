    <p>Osaka and Hokkaido in Ja­pan have turned to nurses from the Self-De­fence Forces for help</p>
    <p>amid a se­vere man­power crunch in the face of a third wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions. In South Korea, the Pres­i­dent has urged the author­i­ties to ramp up con­tact trac­ing as daily in­fec­tions spi­ral up­ward.</p>
    <p>Osaka and Hokkaido, fac­ing a se­vere man­power crunch amid a wors­en­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, have turned to the mil­i­tary for help.</p>
    <p>The de­fence min­istry will dis­patch nurses from the Self-De­fence Forces (SDF) to help treat the surge in pa­tients, Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is suf­fer­ing from a third wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, which is by far its worst.</p>
    <p>Daily case tal­lies hit new highs in re­cent weeks, while the num­ber of ac­tive se­ri­ous cases has dou­bled in three weeks and hit a record high of 530 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s Cabi­net will com­pile a third emer­gency stim­u­lus pack­age to­day, which is ex­pected to in­clude sub­si­dies for med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions, sup­port for ail­ing busi­nesses and funds for an ex­ten­sion of the Go To Travel do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Dis­sat­is­fac­tion with the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to the Covid-19 resur­gence caused ap­proval rat­ings for the Cabi­net to tum­ble in two sep­a­rate polls over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Sup­port fell by nearly 13 points to 50.3 per cent in a Ky­odo News poll, and by eight points to 61 per cent in a Yomi­uri Shim­bun sur­vey.</p>
    <p>In the Ky­odo poll, 76.2 per cent said pre­vent­ing in­fec­tions should take pri­or­ity over stim­u­lat­ing the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In the Yomi­uri sur­vey, 49 per cent found the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse un­favourable, com­pared with the 42 per cent who viewed it pos­i­tively.</p>
    <p>Un­like dur­ing the first wave of cases, when the na­tional gov­ern­ment is­sued a state of emer­gency and en­listed the help of celebri­ties to push the call to stay home, the mes­sag­ing this time has been far more mud­dled.</p>
    <p>This is mostly be­cause the gov­ern­ment is walk­ing a tightrope be­tween bal­anc­ing pub­lic hy­giene and prop­ping up a frail econ­omy with an eye on the bumper holiday sea­son.</p>
    <p>But this has also sent a tacit sig­nal that it is business as usual, de­spite Mr Suga stress­ing that the three weeks be­tween Nov 26 and Dec 17 were ex­tremely im­por­tant to curb the spread of Covid-19 and avoid a med­i­cal break­down.</p>
    <p>Many Ja­panese, how­ever, ap­pear de­ter­mined not to let the dis­ease be a party pooper. Mo­bile data showed crowded streets in Tokyo on Sun­day, with foot traf­fic in the Omote­sando shop­ping district up by 13.7 per cent from a week ago.</p>
    <p>Nearby hot spring re­sorts also recorded a surge in vis­i­tors, with foot traf­fic in Hakone and Atami up by 29.4 per cent and 32.4 per cent re­spec­tively from a week ago.</p>
    <p>Tokyo re­ported 299 new cases yes­ter­day, down from 327 on Sun­day and a record 584 on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers cau­tioned against read­ing too much in the lat­est fig­ure though as Mon­day num­bers are typ­i­cally low due to fewer tests con­ducted over the week­end.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of cases in the week end­ing Sun­day hit a new high of 3,076. Covid-19 bed oc­cu­pancy climbed to 70.3 per cent yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In Osaka, where a “red alert” was de­clared last Thurs­day, SDF nurses will work at the pre­fec­ture’s new Covid-19 fa­cil­ity to treat se­ri­ously ill pa­tients. It is set to open next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>SDF nurses dis­patched to Hokkaido will work in Asahikawa, the pre­fec­ture’s sec­ond-largest city, where there have been two ma­jor hos­pi­tal clus­ters with at least 224 cases and 184 cases re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“The short­age of nurses is at a tip­ping point, and will hin­der med­i­cal ser­vices,” city mayor Masahito Nishikawa told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>He added that he had first sought help from the Hokkaido gov­ern­ment, but other mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties were also strapped and could not spare enough nurses, hence the re­quest for SDF backup.</p>
