    <p>HONG KONG • When the Gen­eral Post Of­fice opened on Hong Kong’s water­front in 1976, a lo­cal news­pa­per pre­dicted that the mod­ernist-style build­ing would “cer­tainly be­come as much of a land­mark” as its Vic­to­rian-era pre­de­ces­sor. Not quite.</p>
    <p>The build­ing – with its white con­crete fa­cade, harsh an­gles and tinted glass – be­came a fix­ture of Hong Kong’s down­town. But it was never added to the city’s reg­is­ter of pro­tected land­marks. Now, with Hong Kong of­fi­cials un­der pres­sure to gen­er­ate rev­enue, the nearly 12 acre site, which has been val­ued at over US$5 bil­lion (S$6.6 bil­lion), was put up for sale this month.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers of the build­ing are scram­bling to save it be­cause who­ever buys the land un­der­neath would have every right to tear down the post of­fice. “Some peo­ple in Hong Kong might think it’s just a white box,” Mr Charles Lai, an ar­chi­tect, said on a re­cent af­ter­noon out­side the post of­fice, where peo­ple were lined up in­side to mail pack­ages. “But, as a mat­ter of fact, this sim­plis­tic aes­thetic is ex­actly where the value is,” he added.</p>
    <p>PRE­SERV­ING COL­LEC­TIVE MEM­O­RIES</p>
    <p>In cities across Asia, res­i­dents and de­sign buffs are ral­ly­ing to save or doc­u­ment post-war build­ings that of­fi­cials con­sider too new, too ugly or too unim­por­tant to pro­tect from de­mo­li­tion. Many of the struc­tures were mu­nic­i­pal build­ings that served as down­town hubs of civic life. The cam­paigns, in a sense, are an at­tempt to pre­serve the col­lec­tive mem­o­ries stored in­side.</p>
    <p>The ef­forts also re­flect an aver­sion to the generic-look­ing shop­ping malls and condominiu­ms that have been re­plac­ing mod­ernist-style build­ings across ur­ban Asia, as well as the nos­tal­gia of city dwellers who watch their sky­lines con­stantly change.</p>
    <p>Mr Lai said the five-storey Hong Kong post of­fice build­ing, de­signed by a gov­ern­ment ar­chi­tect, is in­ter­est­ing be­cause its form de­fines the func­tions per­formed within – a prin­ci­ple of the mod­ernist move­ment that was pop­u­lar from the 1920s to the 1970s. The floors for cus­tomers have loftier ceil­ings and larger win­dows, for ex­am­ple, than the ones for mail-sort­ing ma­chines.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are places that are part of peo­ple’s day-to-day life; they do not nec­es­sar­ily have to be very pretty to be sig­nif­i­cant,” Mr Haider Kik­ab­hoy, who leads her­itage walk­ing tours in Hong Kong, said of the city’s post-war land­marks. With older build­ings, the au­thor­i­ties “tend to fo­cus on the rar­ity of the ar­chi­tec­ture or how well-de­signed the build­ing is, or the his­tor­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance”, he said. “But there are many ways to un­der­stand his­tory, and so­cial his­tory is just as im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>REAPPRAISA­L OF BRUTALISM</p>
    <p>In ar­chi­tec­ture, mod­ernism was ex­pressed through “brutalism” and other styles that sought to evoke the con­di­tions of the ma­chine age and re­lied heav­ily on con­crete as a ma­te­rial. The Bar­bican Cen­tre in Lon­don, which opened in 1982, is a clas­sic ex­am­ple of the bru­tal­ist aes­thetic – and was once voted the city’s ugli­est build­ing. In Asia, mod­ernism in­flu­enced the de­sign of land­marks such as Tokyo’s Ho­tel Okura, which opened be­fore the city played host to the 1964 Olympics, and the dra­mat­i­cally curved con­crete build­ings that ar­chi­tect Le­an­dro V. Loc­sin de­signed across the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Some of the re­gion’s mod­ernist struc­tures be­came in­stantly fa­mous, but oth­ers did not have a fol­low­ing un­til re­cently. The in­ter­est ap­pears to have stemmed in part from a wider reappraisa­l of brutalism in Europe and be­yond, and so­cial me­dia buzz as peo­ple re­dis­cover their un­usual de­sign fea­tures. In some cases, build­ings from the mid- to late-20th cen­tury gen­er­ate pub­lic in­ter­est pre­cisely be­cause they are on the cusp of be­ing de­mol­ished.</p>
    <p>Since last year, two in Hong Kong – a 1967 of­fice tower and a 1973 ho­tel – were torn down, a process that prompted reap­praisals of their ar­chi­tec­tural legacy.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, ubiq­ui­tous sym­bols of quirky mod­ernist de­sign – stand-alone movie the­atres – have been nearly erased. Sev­eral hun­dred had dot­ted the land­scape dur­ing their hey­day, in the 1980s, said Mr Philip Jablon, an in­de­pen­dent re­searcher who wrote a book about them. The last one, La Scala, held its fi­nal screen­ing in Bangkok in July, prompt­ing cin­ema buffs to lament the end of an era.</p>
    <p>In Cam­bo­dia’s cap­i­tal Ph­nom Penh, a decade-long project to doc­u­ment dozens of mod­ernist build­ings found that the ma­jor­ity had been de­stroyed or mod­i­fied amid a wave of con­struc­tion funded by over­seas de­vel­op­ers, said Mr Pen Serey­pagna, a Ph­nom Penh ar­chi­tect in­volved in the re­search ef­fort. About 30 of the build­ings were de­signed by Cam­bo­dia’s best-known ar­chi­tect Vann Moly­vann, who stud­ied mod­ernism in Paris with dis­ci­ples of Swiss-French ar­chi­tect Le Cor­bus­ier.</p>
    <p>In a few cases, in­ter­est in mod­ernist build­ings has trans­lated into con­ser­va­tion vic­to­ries. This year, a con­glom­er­ate agreed to pre­serve Hong Kong’s State Theatre, a quirky 1952 movie house, as part of a rede­vel­op­ment project.</p>
    <p>GOLDEN MILE COM­PLEX</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity in Oc­to­ber took the first steps to­wards gazetting for con­ser­va­tion the Golden Mile Com­plex, a hulk­ing, mixed-use build­ing com­pleted in 1973 that Dutch ar­chi­tect Rem Kool­haas once praised as a “unique work”, as part of a rede­vel­op­ment of the site on which it sits.</p>
    <p>Even though not every mod­ernist build­ing in Sin­ga­pore de­serves to be saved, said Ms Karen Tan, founder of the lo­cal de­sign con­sul­tancy, Pocket Projects, the con­ser­va­tion plan for Golden Mile Com­plex is an “ac­tual en­dorse­ment of the im­por­tance of such build­ings to the na­tion’s so­cial and cul­tural iden­tity”.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally, she added, Sin­ga­pore’s model of ur­ban devel­op­ment has been “bi­ased to­wards a very tab­ula rasa, tear-down-and-re­build sort of ap­proach”.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has oc­ca­sion­ally agreed to pre­serve mod­ernist build­ings scat­tered across its down­town. Among them are the Po­lice Mar­ried Quar­ters, a 1951 build­ing that once housed mar­ried po­lice staff mem­bers and their fam­i­lies, and The Mur­ray, a 1969 gov­ern­ment build­ing whose tiled grid rests on gi­ant white arches.</p>
    <p>But sav­ing the Gen­eral Post Of­fice site presents new chal­lenges. Hong Kong’s sec­re­tary for devel­op­ment Michael Wong has called the site “very valu­able and very strate­gic”. The site is po­lit­i­cally del­i­cate be­cause it lies at the heart of Hong Kong’s water­front, near prop­erty owned by the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army, at a mo­ment when the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is crack­ing down on the ter­ri­tory’s pro-democ­racy move­ment and en­forc­ing a na­tional se­cu­rity law that took ef­fect ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers of the build­ing ex­pect the buyer to be a main­land Chi­nese de­vel­oper who may not be in­clined to pre­serve a relic of the ter­ri­tory’s Bri­tish colo­nial pe­riod, which ended in 1997.</p>
    <p>ADAPTIVE RE­USE</p>
    <p>Ms Katty Law, a prom­i­nent ad­vo­cate for the city’s mod­ernist ar­chi­tec­ture, said of the post of­fice: “They’re look­ing at the money side, the floor area they can gen­er­ate and how much the de­vel­oper can build. They’re not look­ing at the build­ing.”</p>
    <p>A plan­ning brief calls for some postal fa­cil­i­ties to be in­cluded in any new con­struc­tion on the site, but ad­vo­cates say the ex­ist­ing post of­fice it­self has worth. They are ap­peal­ing to the city’s An­tiques Ad­vi­sory Board to re­verse its 2013 de­ci­sion to ex­clude build­ings built in 1970 or later from be­ing con­sid­ered for con­ser­va­tion sta­tus.</p>
    <p>Build­ings like the Gen­eral Post Of­fice, they say, could be ear­marked for “adaptive re­use” in a way that gen­er­ates new in­come – just as The Mur­ray be­came a lux­ury ho­tel and the Po­lice</p>
    <p>Mar­ried Quar­ters were trans­formed into a war­ren of up­scale bou­tiques. Hong Kong’s Devel­op­ment Bureau said in a brief state­ment that the ad­vi­sory board’s pol­icy had not changed. So the post of­fice build­ing may be in its twi­light.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong ar­chi­tect Lai said he was not sure what to think of the gov­ern­ment’s stance on the build­ing. “The gov­ern­ment kind of treats this, ei­ther in­ten­tion­ally or un­in­ten­tion­ally, as some­thing that’s re­place­able,” he said. “They don’t re­ally see it as a sym­bol or a land­mark, which makes peo­ple think: ‘Are you do­ing that in­ten­tion­ally, to erase colo­nial his­tory, or are you sim­ply not able to see the value?’”</p>
