    <p>Self-con­fessed “trav­el­holic” Min­nie Liu is go­ing on va­ca­tion, her first for the year, dur­ing the “Golden Week” hol­i­days next month.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old fi­nance ex­ec­u­tive, who went on eight trips last year, wanted to do bet­ter than that this year but her plans were scup­pered by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Now that the sit­u­a­tion looks more sta­ble, my friends and I are spend­ing all the money we saved on a week-long Qing­hai and Gansu hol­i­day,” she said.</p>
    <p>She is not alone: The bat­tered tourism sec­tor is bank­ing its re­cov­ery on the week-long hol­i­days, which be­gin on Oct 1. The in­dus­try ex­pects to see its first boom of the year next week, mak­ing it the most im­por­tant hol­i­day pe­riod yet.</p>
    <p>This year’s Golden Week, which al­ways co­in­cides with China’s Na­tional Day, will in­clude the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional travel is still im­pos­si­ble, but the in­dus­try hopes to match last year’s record of 782 mil­lion do­mes­tic trips in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But a key group of trav­ellers – col­lege stu­dents – will miss the fun this year.</p>
    <p>To make up for lost cur­ricu­lum time as a re­sult of school clo­sures, some uni­ver­si­ties have cho­sen to shorten va­ca­tion time so stu­dents can catch up on their stud­ies.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also fun­da­men­tally changed hol­i­day habits: Trav­ellers are now more con­scious about health and hy­giene, pre­fer to travel in smaller groups and are will­ing to spend more.</p>
    <p>Re­search from the Trip.com Group, which runs sev­eral reser­va­tion plat­forms, found that driv­ing hol­i­days had be­come ex­tremely pop­u­lar, with rental ve­hi­cles al­ready fully booked in some lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“Espe­cially pop­u­lar are western re­gions like Yun­nan and Xin­jiang, as well as Hainan, be­cause these places are more suit­able for self­driv­ing hol­i­days,” Mr Peng Liang of Trip.com Group’s data re­search cen­tre told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic trav­ellers are be­com­ing so­phis­ti­cated and are not only will­ing to spend more but also ex­pect­ing unique ex­pe­ri­ences, he said.</p>
    <p>“Yet, at the same time, you have to bear in mind that there are many trav­ellers who are getting on a plane for the first time, so reg­u­lar tourist sites are still pop­u­lar,” he said.</p>
    <p>Nearly five months af­ter China eased in­ter-pro­vin­cial travel curbs, there re­mains pent-up de­mand, espe­cially among those who had saved up for long over­seas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic lux­ury travel is trend­ing very strongly, said gen­eral man­ager Sherona Shng of Four Sea­sons Ho­tel in Shen­zhen.</p>
    <p>The Four Sea­sons group started to see busi­ness pick­ing up fol­low­ing the eas­ing of in­ter-pro­vin­cial travel in May and ex­pects over 80 per cent oc­cu­pancy for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, trav­eller habits have changed since and in the postCovid pe­riod we are see­ing a much shorter tran­sient book­ing win­dow in which a ma­jor­ity of guests are book­ing their stays only sev­eral days in ad­vance or even on the day it­self,” she added.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly for the Shangri-La Group, which has half of its prop­erty port­fo­lio lo­cated in China, the resur­gence of leisure and cor­po­rate travel has seen oc­cu­pancy hit­ting 48 per cent in July.</p>
    <p>“Tier-2 cities such as Hangzhou, Lhasa, Diqing, Hainan and Qin­huang­dao ben­e­fited from pent-up stay­ca­tion de­mand,” said a spokesman for the group, which op­er­ates the Shangri-La, Kerry and JEN brands in China.</p>
    <p>But not all tour op­er­a­tors will ben­e­fit from the surge in lo­cal trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Most Chi­nese trav­el­ling do­mes­ti­cally tend to do their book­ings on­line, es­chew­ing the need for guides or travel com­pa­nies, said travel agency owner Song Kai.</p>
    <p>“Of course the in­dus­try is big and oth­ers who op­er­ate ho­tels, inns and lo­cal busi­nesses will ben­e­fit,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But there’s hardly any need to hire a guide be­cause most peo­ple know their way around so agen­cies like ours don’t get a share of the pie.”</p>
    <p>Mr Song said that his com­pany lost about t wo mil­lion yuan (S$402,000) dur­ing the pan­demic but has tried to con­tinue pay­ing his staff a min­i­mum wage.</p>
    <p>The agency spe­cialises in high­end for­eign travel, with trips in­clud­ing fine din­ing ex­pe­ri­ences at Miche­lin-starred restau­rants, he said.</p>
    <p>“We have 20,000 fans who are al­ways in­ter­ested in what we’re do­ing next. We know that when travel re­opens, they’ll come right back,” he said.</p>
