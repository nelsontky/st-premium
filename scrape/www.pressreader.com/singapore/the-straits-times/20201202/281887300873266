    <p>• Sci­en­tists say they have de­vel­oped a way to pre­dict if pa­tients will de­velop Alzheimer’s disease by analysing their blood, in what ex­perts have hailed as a po­ten­tial game changer in the fight against the de­bil­i­tat­ing con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Around 50 mil­lion peo­ple live with Alzheimer’s, a de­gen­er­a­tive brain disease that ac­counts for more than half of global de­men­tia cases.</p>
    <p>While its pre­cise mech­a­nism is not fully un­der­stood, Alzheimer’s ap­pears to re­sult from the ac­cu­mu­la­tion of pro­teins i n the brain that are thought to lead to the death of neu­rons. Some of th­ese pro­teins are trace­able in the blood of pa­tients and tests based on their con­cen­tra­tions can be used to di­ag­nose the disease.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists i n Swe­den and Bri­tain now be­lieve that blood tests can be used to pre­dict Alzheimer’s years be­fore the on­set of symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing in the jour­nal Na­ture Ag­ing, they de­scribed how they de­vel­oped and val­i­dated mod­els of in­di­vid­ual risk based on the lev­els of two key pro­teins in blood sam­ples taken from more than 550 pa­tients with mi­nor cog­ni­tive im­pair­ments.</p>
    <p>The model based off of th­ese two pro­teins had an 88 per cent suc­cess rate in pre­dict­ing the on­set of Alzheimer’s i n the same pa­tients over the course of four years.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists said that while fur­ther study is needed, their model could have sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on Alzheimer’s cases, given that plasma biomark­ers from blood tests are “promis­ing due to their high ac­ces­si­bil­ity and low cost”.</p>
    <p>Head of re­search Richard Oak­ley from the Alzheimer’s So­ci­ety on Mon­day said the main strug­gle in bat­tling the disease was di­ag­nos­ing cases early enough to in­ter­vene with ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ments.</p>
    <p>“If th­ese blood biomark­ers can pre­dict Alzheimer’s i n larger, more di­verse groups, we could see a rev­o­lu­tion in how we test new de­men­tia drugs.”</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Ox­ford’s pro­fes­sor of neu­rol­ogy Mu­said Hu­sain, who was not in­volved in the re­search, said: “For the first time, we have a blood test that can pre­dict well the risk of sub­se­quent de­vel­op­ment of Alzheimer’s disease in peo­ple who have mild cog­ni­tive symp­toms... We need fur­ther val­i­da­tion (of the re­sults), but in the con­text of other re­cent find­ings, this could be a trans­for­ma­tive step to ear­lier di­ag­no­sis, as well as test­ing new treat­ments at ear­lier stages of the disease.”</p>
