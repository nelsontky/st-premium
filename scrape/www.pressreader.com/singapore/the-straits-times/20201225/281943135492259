    <p>NEW YORK • Twenty-three peo­ple were res­cued af­ter an ex­plo­sion in an of­fice build­ing in down­town Bal­ti­more caused part of the struc­ture’s roof to col­lapse, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Fire­fight­ers and am­bu­lances re­sponded to the Bal­ti­more Gas and Elec­tric (BGE) Com­pany build­ing on Cen­ter Street af­ter the ex­plo­sion was re­ported some time af­ter 8.30am lo­cal time on Wed­nes­day (9.30am yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>Twenty-one peo­ple were taken to hospi­tals, the Bal­ti­more City Fire De­part­ment said.</p>
    <p>The de­part­ment said ear­lier that nine peo­ple were in crit­i­cal con­di­tion and one per­son was in se­ri­ous con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Two peo­ple were pulled to safety from a win­dow-wash­ing plat­form that dan­gled pre­car­i­ously against the build­ing’s fa­cade af­ter the ex­plo­sion, said the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mayor Bran­don Scott of Bal­ti­more told re­porters at the scene: “Right now, we need peo­ple to pray for those peo­ple that were in­side of this build­ing and pray­ing that they all have a speedy and full re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sion took place on the 16th floor of the 21-storey build­ing, ac­cord­ing to a Bal­ti­more fire­fight­ers union.</p>
    <p>The Bal­ti­more field of­fice of the Bureau of Al­co­hol, Tobacco, Firearms and Ex­plo­sives said on Twit­ter that its spe­cial agents were at the scene as­sist­ing city po­lice and fire of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Wed­nes­day evening, BGE said the ex­plo­sion “ap­pears to be re­lated to con­struc­tion work that was oc­cur­ring on the build­ing’s air han­dling and boiler sys­tem” and that it “was not nat­u­ral gas-re­lated”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany added: “The build­ing was largely empty due to the up­com­ing hol­i­days and the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>BGE spokesman Stephanie Weaver said on Wed­nes­day evening that 21 con­struc­tion con­trac­tors were treated at a hospi­tal for in­juries, none of which were life-threat­en­ing. Twelve of those in­jured con­trac­tors had al­ready been re­leased, she added.</p>
    <p>Video footage from a lo­cal TV sta­tion showed the res­cue of the two work­ers who were trapped on the win­dow-clean­ing plat­form. The plat­form dan­gled at an an­gle as fire­fight­ers broke win­dows to reach the work­ers.</p>
    <p>One worker was pulled in­side the build­ing through a 10th-floor win­dow. A fire­fighter climbed up the plat­form and pulled the se­cond worker through a win­dow on the 11th floor, Chief Niles Ford of the Bal­ti­more City Fire De­part­ment told re­porters at the scene.</p>
    <p>He said those work­ers were “in pretty de­cent con­di­tion”.</p>
