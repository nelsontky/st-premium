    <p>Deal­ing with large num­bers of mi­grant work­ers dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is com­plex. They face wor­ry­ing men­tal health chal­lenges and there are con­cerns over how phys­i­cally and men­tally ready they are to re­turn to work (Steps to ease move­ment curbs, boost well-be­ing; 265,000 for­eign work­ers get nod to re­turn to work, both Aug 6).</p>
    <p>This readi­ness needs to be es­tab­lished be­fore the work­ers take on high-risk jobs, to en­sure their safety. The last thing we want is to have them hurt them­selves af­ter hav­ing re­cov­ered from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been in lock­down for months, the work­ers have lost some mea­sure of their pro­fes­sional cur­rency – op­er­a­tional and also skills wise, de­pend­ing on the com­plex­ity of their jobs. So it is es­sen­tial to take baby steps to­wards get­ting them back to work.</p>
    <p>Be­sides track­ing the health of work­ers who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19, other key is­sues need to be con­sid­ered af­ter months of in­ac­tiv­ity for all work­ers.</p>
    <p>For work­ers in phys­i­cally de­mand­ing jobs, do they have the nec­es­sary strength and stamina?</p>
    <p>For work­ers in jobs that re­quire men­tal fo­cus, how men­tally strong and re­silient are they?</p>
    <p>What wor­ries do they have that may dis­tract them at work and un­der­mine sit­u­a­tional aware­ness?</p>
    <p>How can lead­ers and su­per­vi­sors track their work­ers, and what in­di­ca­tors should they look out for to as­cer­tain that their work­ers are fit for work or are cop­ing well?</p>
    <p>Safety pro­fes­sion­als, men­tal health spe­cial­ists, dorm op­er­a­tors, and work­site man­agers and su­per­vi­sors need to work to­gether to avoid ac­ci­dents over the next six months.</p>
