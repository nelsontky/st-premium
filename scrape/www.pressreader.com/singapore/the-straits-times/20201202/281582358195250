    <p>Mr Anies Baswedan, the Jakarta gov­er­nor, an­nounced yes­ter­day that he has been in­fected with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Anies said in an In­sta­gram video that a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test he took on Mon­day showed he was pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He said: “The re­sult of the test showed I’m pos­i­tive (for Covid-19).</p>
    <p>“I de­cided to an­nounce this – as we’ve al­ways done in tack­ling the Covid-19 since March – by com­mu­ni­cat­ing the is­sue as it hap­pens, in a trans­par­ent and com­pre­hen­sive man­ner. We up­hold trans­parency per­tain­ing to poli­cies and it is the same re­gard­ing my sit­u­a­tion to­day.”</p>
    <p>Mr Anies said he will self-iso­late at his of­fi­cial res­i­dence but will work and chair meet­ings virtually.</p>
    <p>He urged those who have in­ter­acted with him to self-iso­late or take a swab test for the virus.</p>
    <p>He also said he had in­ter­acted in­ten­sively with Deputy Gov­er­nor</p>
    <p>Ah­mad Riza Pa­tria, who has also con­tracted the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Prior to Mr Anies and his deputy, Jakarta ad­min­is­tra­tion sec­re­tary Sae­ful­lah tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in mid-Septem­ber and later died.</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor has been un­der fire for vis­it­ing vig­i­lante group Is­lam De­fend­ers Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shi­hab on Nov 10, hours af­ter the fire­brand cleric re­turned from his self-ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia to be mobbed by thou­sands in a hero’s wel­come.</p>
    <p>He was also crit­i­cised for fail­ing to stop a mass gath­er­ing in cap­i­tal city Jakarta on Nov 14, when thou­sands of mostly mask­less FPI sup­port­ers massed to­gether to cel­e­brate the wed­ding of Mr Rizieq’s daugh­ter and com­mem­o­rate Prophet Muham­mad’s birthday.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia re­mains the coun­try in South-east Asia worst hit by the pan­demic, with 543,975 recorded Covid-19 cases as at yes­ter­day, of which 137,919 were from Jakarta, and 17,081 deaths, of which 2,683 oc­curred in the cap­i­tal city.</p>
    <p>There were 5,092 new cases and 136 deaths yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A high-risk Covid-19 red zone, Jakarta has im­posed a slew of re­stric­tions on so­cial gath­er­ings, known lo­cally as PSBB, lim­it­ing them to five peo­ple and cap­ping oc­cu­pancy in restau­rants at 50 per cent of their to­tal ca­pac­ity.</p>
