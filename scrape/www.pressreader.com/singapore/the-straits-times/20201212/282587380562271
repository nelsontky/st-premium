    <p>Manch­ester derby, prob­a­bly the best game you can ask for af­ter such a dis­ap­point­ment...</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United’s early Cham­pi­ons League exit means Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer’s po­si­tion is back un­der scru­tiny ahead of Manch­ester City’s visit to Old Traf­ford to­day.</p>
    <p>This will be a Premier League derby nei­ther side can af­ford to lose. A fourth de­feat in six topflight games at home this sea­son could see the Red Devils fin­ish the week­end eight points off the jointlead­ers, Tot­ten­ham and Liver­pool, al­beit with a game in hand.</p>
    <p>City (18), who are a point be­hind the hosts and seventh, lost three of their four meet­ings last sea­son, in­clud­ing twice in the league.</p>
    <p>But Sol­sk­jaer is un­der greater pres­sure af­ter his side dropped back into the Europa League in mid­week, although City boss Pep Guardi­ola yes­ter­day ex­pressed his con­fi­dence that the United board know the Nor­we­gian’s value.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to know the value of Sol­sk­jaer, there’s no doubt about this,” said Guardi­ola.</p>
    <p>“I don’t have to give him sup­port be­cause he’s strong enough and knows how this job works... when we win we’re a ge­nius, when we lose we have to be sacked.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Sol­sk­jaer is ex­pect­ing his side to show a re­sponse against City to­day, even though he claimed his play­ers have made progress from last term.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery player is the same. Any player that plays foot­ball should be dis­ap­pointed when you lose a game,” he said at his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“They want to bounce back and win the next one. We’ve han­dled set­backs well, dur­ing games and be­fore the next game. You need to an­a­lyse what went wrong.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant not to press the panic but­ton be­cause you can’t win ev­ery game. Some games will hurt more than oth­ers and have more con­se­quences than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“We’re fac­ing the re­al­ity of no Cham­pi­ons League and we move on. We need to get back into the Cham­pi­ons League by im­prov­ing.”</p>
    <p>In­sist­ing that his play­ers were still mov­ing in the right di­rec­tion de­spite a stop-start cam­paign, the Nor­we­gian added: “I feel we’re get­ting bet­ter and bet­ter and look­ing more like a United team that I want, with fast at­tack­ers, dy­namic.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got good play­ers and in­di­vid­ual qual­ity that can cre­ate magic out of noth­ing. That’s al­ways been at United but we can see more of the pen­e­tra­tion and con­sis­tency ev­ery­one says we don’t have.</p>
    <p>“We’ve won our last four in the league which has be­come a good run and hope­fully, that con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>“It was a tight (Cham­pi­ons League) group de­cided by fine mar­gins, you can see that in most games... Manch­ester derby, prob­a­bly the best game you can ask for af­ter such a dis­ap­point­ment be­cause it does stick in your sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>United will wel­come back An</p>
    <p>OLE GUN­NAR SOL­SK­JAER, Man United man­ager, on to­day’s derby against City.</p>
    <p>HE KNOWS THE SCORE</p>
    <p>He’s strong enough and knows how this job works... when we win, we’re a ge­nius, when we lose, we have to be sacked.</p>
    <p>PEP GUARDI­OLA, Man City man­ager, on his United coun­ter­part.</p>
    <p>thony Mar­tial af­ter he missed the RB Leipzig trip with a knock, while Edin­son Ca­vani, an­other mid­week ab­sen­tee, is also likely to re­turn.</p>
    <p>With prac­ti­cally a full squad from which to pick, Sol­sk­jaer has some se­lec­tion is­sues to solve, like</p>
    <p>David de Gea, who came in for some fierce crit­i­cism in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Pun­dit and ex-United mid­fielder Paul Sc­holes felt that the ’keeper “bot­tled it” dur­ing the 3-2 loss that sealed their Cham­pi­ons League fate, re­new­ing calls for Dean Hen</p>
    <p>der­son to take re­place him.</p>
    <p>Back­ing the Spain No. 1, Sol­sk­jaer said: “David’s a top goal­keeper and rightly on the lists of best goal­keep­ers in Europe, he’s han­dled crit­i­cism and set­backs be­fore, he’s a man that we re­ally rely on and hope­fully, he’s not af­fected by crit­i­cism and I don’t think he will be.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">United goal&#xAD;keeper David de Gea was crit&#xAD;i&#xAD;cised in Ger&#xAD;many for his per&#xAD;for&#xAD;mance in the 3-2 Cham&#xAD;pi&#xAD;ons League loss. But man&#xAD;ager Ole Gun&#xAD;nar Sol&#xAD;sk&#xAD;jaer has backed him ahead of to&#xAD;day&#x2019;s match against Manch&#xAD;ester City.</p>
