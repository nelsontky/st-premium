    <p>Prospects for Sin­ga­pore’s ex­port sec­tor are look­ing far rosier now, thanks to a bet­ter-than-ex­pected per­for­mance from in­dus­tries such as phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and elec­tron­ics in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The im­proved sen­ti­ment here is re­flected more broadly, with global trade un­likely to reach the worstcase sce­nario pro­jected ear­lier by the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO), En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>(ESG) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The more op­ti­mistic out­look has prompted the agency to raise Sin­ga­pore’s trade fore­casts, with non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) now pre­dicted to grow by 3 to 5 per cent over last year – a stark re­ver­sal from the -4 to -1 per cent de­cline it pre­dicted in May.</p>
    <p>Also, to­tal mer­chan­dise trade is</p>
    <p>now tipped to shrink at a slower pace of 8 to 10 per cent, from the -12 to -9 per cent slump in­di­cated in May.</p>
    <p>Nodx for the sec­ond quar­ter also came in bet­ter than ex­pected, al­beit from the low base a year ago, largely bol­stered by non-elec­tron­ics such as non-mone­tary gold and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals.</p>
    <p>Ship­ments in­creased 6.5 per cent in the three months to June 30 over the same pe­riod last year and im­proved on the 5.4 per cent year-on-year growth in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>But to­tal mer­chan­dise trade fell 15.2 per cent, re­vers­ing the 0.5 per cent gain in the first three months of the year.</p>
    <p>Oil ship­ments con­tracted by 61.9 per cent year on year on the back of lower crude prices, con­tin­u­ing the 15.9 per cent slide from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, while nonoil trade fell by 3.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>The WTO has af­firmed that trade vol­umes are now un­likely to reach the worst-case sce­nario of a 32 per cent con­trac­tion pro­jected in April, ESG noted.</p>
    <p>While global trade fell sharply in the first half of the year, the con­trac­tion was tem­pered by rapid gov­ern­ment re­sponses, it added.</p>
    <p>Higher ship­ments of disk me­dia prod­ucts and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment helped lift elec­tron­ics ex­ports by 10.6 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter, af­ter a 2.3 per cent dip in the first.</p>
    <p>Non-elec­tron­ics Nodx were buoy­ant as well, up 5.4 per cent thanks to higher con­tri­bu­tions from non-mone­tary gold, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and spe­cialised ma­chin­ery.</p>
    <p>Over­all, ship­ments to Sin­ga­pore’s ma­jor trade part­ners grew in the sec­ond quar­ter, with the United States, Ja­pan and South Korea among the big­gest cus­tomers, al­though ex­ports to China, Hong Kong, In­done­sia, Malaysia and Thai­land de­clined.</p>
    <p>On a quar­terly ba­sis, Nodx fell 2.4 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter in con­trast to the 7.3 per cent ex­pan­sion in the first three months of the year.</p>
    <p>To­tal ser­vices trade con­tracted 22.2 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter, con­tin­u­ing the first quar­ter’s 3.2 per cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>To­tal ser­vices trade came in at $107 bil­lion for the quar­ter, with ser­vice ex­ports con­tract­ing 20.3 per cent, while im­ports dipped 24.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>The de­cline in ser­vice ex­ports was at­trib­uted to the de­crease in travel re­ceipts, trans­port ser­vice ex­ports, and re­ceipts from main­te­nance and re­pair ser­vices.</p>
