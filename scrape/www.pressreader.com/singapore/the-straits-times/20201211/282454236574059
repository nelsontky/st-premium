    <p>HERN­ING • Liver­pool man­ager Jurgen Klopp has said he is no longer sure the use of video as­sis­tant ref­eree (VAR) tech­nol­ogy is good for foot­ball after Wed­nes­day’s Cham­pi­ons League match against Midtjyl­land was in­ter­rupted three times in the sec­ond half, caus­ing long de­lays.</p>
    <p>The Group D tie was a dead rub­ber as the Reds had al­ready advanced to the last 16 as group winners, so the vis­i­tors fielded an ex­per­i­men­tal side in Den­mark.</p>
    <p>Klopp gave Leighton Clark­son his full de­but in the com­pe­ti­tion and fel­low academy player Billy Koume­tio his first ap­pear­ance off the bench.</p>
    <p>But the match, which ended 1-1 after Mo­hamed Salah’s strike was can­celled out by a sec­ond-half penalty by Alexan­der Scholz, was marred by VAR checks.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent which led to the hosts’ equaliser had to be re­viewed, while the ac­tion was also halted as the sys­tem dis­al­lowed goals for ei­ther side late on.</p>
    <p>Al­though Klopp agreed with all three de­ci­sions, he ex­pressed his con­cerns about the amount of time play­ers had to wait on the pitch in win­try con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“I used to be one of the peo­ple who said VAR is a good idea, I’m re­ally not sure if I would say that again to be hon­est,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“It just took too long. I think in the end, I didn’t see it back, the de­ci­sions were right but it was so dif­fi­cult, it took three or four min­utes and it was cold for the boys.”</p>
    <p>Klopp was, how­ever, happy with the spirit shown de­spite mak­ing eight changes from the side who smashed Wolves 4-0 in the Pre­mier League last week­end.</p>
    <p>Salah, just one of three play­ers re­tained, nabbed his 22nd Cham­pi­ons League goal, sur­pass­ing for­mer cap­tain Steven Ger­rard as the club’s record scorer in Europe’s elite club com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“Ex­cep­tional player, ab­so­lutely ex­cep­tional player,” Klopp said.</p>
    <p>“Since we (have) worked to­gether, ob­vi­ously a lot of things (have) clicked re­ally for all of us.</p>
    <p>“He helps the team mas­sively, and he knows and ap­pre­ci­ates the help of the team as well.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, Manchester City boss Pep Guardi­ola also hailed the con­tri­bu­tions of his key striker, Ser­gio Aguero.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian in­ter­na­tional, mak­ing only his fifth ap­pear­ance of the sea­son due to in­juries, came off the bench to poke home from close range as City brushed aside Mar­seille 3-0 at the Eti­had.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s men con­firmed their place in the last 16 as Group C winners and on Aguero, who took his Cham­pi­ons League goals tally to 41, the Cata­lan said “his in­stinct to score goals will al­ways be there”.</p>
