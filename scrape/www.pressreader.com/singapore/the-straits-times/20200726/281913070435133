    <p>HONG KONG • At least seven po­ten­tial pro-democ­racy can­di­dates for Hong Kong’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil elec­tions in Septem­ber have re­ceived ques­tion­naires from the gov­ern­ment ask­ing them to show they have not vi­o­lated the city’s mini-Con­sti­tu­tion or re­cently im­posed se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Ye­ung and Mr Cheng Tat-hung of the Civic Party, Mr Ken­neth Le­ung who plans to rep­re­sent the ac­coun­tancy sec­tor, and four other op­po­si­tion fig­ures have re­ceived let­ters of in­quiry from their elec­toral of­fi­cers re­quest­ing that they val­i­date their ap­pli­ca­tions for the elec­tions, ac­cord­ing to re­ports in Ming Pao, HK01 and Stand News.</p>
    <p>Mr Ye­ung was asked to ex­plain his re­cent visit to the US where he met Amer­i­can of­fi­cials and called for sanc­tions against cer­tain Hong Kong of­fi­cials, and if he will con­tinue l ob­by­ing for­eign gov­ern­ments, ac­cord­ing to the let­ter seen by Bloomberg. It cited his so­cial­me­dia posts and me­dia in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>“Your re­quests to for­eign coun­tries to make leg­is­la­tion to sanc­tion the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment is in fact pres­sur­ing the gov­ern­ment with the help of for­eign pow­ers and invit­ing for­eign forces to in­ter­fere in Hong Kong’s in­ter­nal af­fairs,” said the let­ter to Mr Ye­ung.</p>
    <p>It added: “How would such be­hav­iour con­cur with what you de­clared in your nom­i­na­tion state­ment to ‘up­hold the Ba­sic Law and to pledge al­le­giance to the Hong Kong Spe­cial Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­gion’.”</p>
    <p>Bei­jing passed a na­tional se­cu­rity law late last month for the for­mer Bri­tish colony, crim­i­nal­is­ing sub­ver­sion and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces, with the max­i­mum pun­ish­ment be­ing a life sen­tence.</p>
    <p>The city’s pro-democ­racy par­ties this month held a two-day pri­mary in an ef­fort to nar­row a surge of can­di­dates ahead of the Septem­ber elec­tions. The bal­lot drew more than 600,000 vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s gov­ern­ment and China’s top agency in the city have said the process could vi­o­late the new se­cu­rity mea­sures and pledged to in­ves­ti­gate and pos­si­bly pros­e­cute the pri­mary’s or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>The un­of­fi­cial vot­ing process was de­signed to over­come frac­tures in the op­po­si­tion move­ment be­tween tra­di­tional democrats and more rad­i­cal so-called “lo­cal­ists”, and pre­sent an or­gan­ised slate of can­di­dates that could then ben­e­fit from the mo­men­tum gen­er­ated by last year’s his­toric protests to oust proestab­lish­ment ri­vals.</p>
