    <p>•</p>
    <p>SYD­NEY Hun­dreds of New Zealand plane pas­sen­gers started ar­riv­ing in Syd­ney yes­ter­day as part of a new trans-Tas­man travel bub­ble amid a rapidly fall­ing growth rate in cases at the epi­cen­tre of Aus­tralia’s coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>In a ten­ta­tive re­open­ing to in­ter­na­tional tourism, trav­ellers on the ap­proved flights will not be re­quired to quar­an­tine in Syd­ney, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>The ar­range­ments, how­ever, are not yet re­cip­ro­cal, with New Zealand re­quir­ing ar­rivals to be quar­an­tined for two weeks un­der su­per­vi­sion at a cost of NZ$3,100 (S$2,780) for the first per­son and more for ad­di­tional fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Around 90 per cent of those trav­el­ling yes­ter­day with Air New Zealand were booked to travel one way, the air­line said.</p>
    <p>New South Wales Pre­mier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian said she hoped New Zealand would loosen re­stric­tions on peo­ple ar­riv­ing from Aus­tralia soon.</p>
    <p>“It is an im­por­tant first step in bring­ing back in­ter­na­tional travel, and we hope that Prime Min­is­ter (Jacinda) Ardern re­turns the favour in the near fu­ture,” said Ms Bere­jik­lian, re­fer­ring to the New Zealand leader.</p>
    <p>There was one new case of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in New South Wales in the past 24 hours, Ms Bere­jik­lian said, while adding that she would like to an­nounce a fur­ther eas­ing of re­stric­tions next week if the case count re­mains low.</p>
    <p>While Aus­tralia has en­dured a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, the case load is mod­est com­pared with out­breaks in much of Europe and North Amer­ica. With the ex­cep­tion of those liv­ing in the south-eastern state of Vic­to­ria, most peo­ple in Aus­tralia are sub­ject to only mod­est pan­demic re­stric­tions, with lim­its on gath­er­ings the main dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>In Vic­to­ria, the epi­cen­tre of the sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions in Aus­tralia, the au­thor­i­ties recorded just two new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, the low­est daily in­crease since early June.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria, and in par­tic­u­lar the state cap­i­tal Mel­bourne, have en­dured months of strict lock­down mea­sures, although Pre­mier Daniel An­drews is due to an­nounce plans to ease some re­stric­tions to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews said yes­ter­day that the state was “well-placed to take sig­nif­i­cant steps” to ease re­stric­tions, but added that the next move out of lock­down would still be rel­a­tively con­ser­va­tive, high­light­ing the need to keep so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place to avoid another out­break.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia was be­gin­ning to re­lax virus re­stric­tions in June when a bun­gled ho­tel quar­an­tine sys­tem in Mel­bourne leaked coro­n­avirus into the com­mu­nity, spark­ing a sec­ond wave which in­fected thou­sands and killed more than 800.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from New Zealand on “no-quar­an­tine” flights will be able to go to New South Wales, the Aus­tralian Cap­i­tal Ter­ri­tory and the North­ern Ter­ri­tory with­out hav­ing to un­dergo quar­an­tine upon ar­rival, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>The states of Western Aus­tralia, Queens­land and Tas­ma­nia have ei­ther closed bor­ders or lim­ited en­try which can in­clude quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods, while Vic­to­ri­ans are heav­ily re­stricted in where they can travel.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son an­nounced yes­ter­day an ex­pan­sion of a quar­an­tine hub in the coun­try’s north to al­low more Aus­tralians stranded over­seas to re­turn home.</p>
    <p>SPURRING IN­TER­NA­TIONAL TRAVEL</p>
    <p>It is an im­por­tant first step in bring­ing back in­ter­na­tional travel, and we hope that Prime Min­is­ter (Jacinda) Ardern re­turns the favour in the near fu­ture.</p>

    <p>GLA­DYS BERE­JIK­LIAN, re­fer­ring to the New Zealand leader. She hopes that the coun­try would loosen re­stric­tions on peo­ple ar­riv­ing from Aus­tralia shortly.</p>
