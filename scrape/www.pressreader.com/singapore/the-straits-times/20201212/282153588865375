    <p>Bri­tish re­tailer Marks & Spencer will be clos­ing its out­let at Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre on Dec 31, but its 10 other stores is­land­wide will re­main open.</p>
    <p>The up­date comes af­ter the com­pany placed an ad­ver­tise­ment in The Straits Times on Thurs­day about a “mov­ing out sale” at its Raf­fles City shop.</p>
    <p>The ad­ver­tise­ment said that there are dis­counts of up to 70 per cent on items. The clo­sure on Dec 31 will bring to an end 34 years of oper­a­tion at the lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>A Marks & Spencer spokesman told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that all af­fected staff will be re­lo­cated to other stores or re­de­ployed in the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Asked if there are plans to close other Marks & Spencer out­lets, the spokesman said: “Marks & Spencer... re­mains fully com­mit­ted to the lo­cal mar­ket and is con­tin­u­ally look­ing to ex­plore growth op­por­tu­ni­ties for busi­ness here in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Both Marks & Spencer and sis­ter brand Robin­sons are part of the</p>
    <p>Dubai-based Al-Fut­taim Group, owned by Emi­rati ty­coon Ab­dulla Al Fut­taim and run by his son Omar, ac­cord­ing to Forbes.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Robin­sons an­nounced its exit af­ter 162 years of op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore. It has con­tin­ued to keep its last two stores, at The Heeren and Raf­fles City, open for clos­ing-down sales.</p>
    <p>Its liq­uida­tors told The Busi­ness Times this week that Robin­sons’ flag­ship store at The Heeren will close next Wed­nes­day, but said that they are still in talks with the land­lord at Raf­fles City.</p>
    <p>The Marks & Spencer branch at Raf­fles City is the only one clos­ing as the lease is signed un­der Robin­sons, BT re­ported.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited the out­let at about 6.30pm on Thurs­day, there was no queue to en­ter the store, which had sales posters dis­played at the en­trance and in many spots in the shop.</p>
    <p>Ms Mar­i­lyn Ng, who works in the fi­nance sec­tor, was there with her hus­band to buy clothes.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng said that she hap­pened to be do­ing some Christ­mas shop­ping in the area and chanced upon the sale at Marks & Spencer.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng, who is in her 40s, added that she has been shop­ping at Marks & Spencer for about 20 years and reg­u­larly buys clothes and food from the re­tailer.</p>
    <p>As for the mov­ing-out sale, Ms Ng said it did not ap­pear un­usual to her, since it is the fes­tive sea­son and many shops are hav­ing sales any­way.</p>
    <p>The staff at the shop said that the re­tail chain is just mov­ing out of the Raf­fles City out­let, but it is not clos­ing down, and that its other out­lets will stay open.</p>
    <p>The re­tail chain had opened a pop-up out­let on the first floor of Water­way Point in Pung­gol in late Oc­to­ber, which will op­er­ate for six months.</p>
    <p>Marks & Spencer also said it had no in­ten­tion of clos­ing its “thriv­ing busi­ness” in Sin­ga­pore, although the fran­chise has not been mak­ing as much re­cently, record­ing earn­ings of $101,613 in 2018, down from $2.9 mil­lion a year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Marks & Spencer... re­mains fully com­mit­ted to the lo­cal mar­ket and is con­tin­u­ally look­ing to ex­plore growth op­por­tu­ni­ties for busi­ness here in Sin­ga­pore. ’’</p>
