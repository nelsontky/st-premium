    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19) Thanks to your ef­forts, life is a lit­tle eas­ier. Show the im­por­tant peo­ple that things are head­ing in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is still boosted and you should find that you can count on it when you are work­ing on cre­ative projects.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You run into some prob­lems – maybe a hard limit to your free­dom – but do not de­spair. Your en­ergy will re­turn quite soon.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Now is the best time for you to fol­low through on old com­mit­ments. You sur­prise the right peo­ple and make great progress.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is spread too thin, which may make you reach for more than your share of the good­ies when the time is ripe. Hold back.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Try some­thing to­tally new and dif­fer­ent. It could be as sim­ple as a new place for lunch or as com­plex as a move to a new city.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Let go when you can see that it needs to hap­pen. Your men­tal en­ergy may be bet­ter spent on projects re­lated to your so­cial life.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21) Flex­i­bil­ity is ev­ery­thing now, so you need to be pre­pared to let go of old ideas or move quickly when the sit­u­a­tion calls for it.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) There is a lot on your shoul­ders, but you wel­come the re­spon­si­bil­ity. It is a good day for you to take on a lead­er­ship role.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) Show off your fa­mil­ial or col­le­gial spirit and get ev­ery­one to pitch in while hav­ing a blast. You can do it.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Things are chang­ing – which is usu­ally how you like it – but for now, you may need to ask for a breather. Your en­ergy will re­turn soon.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20) Ro­mance is on your mind and you may find you can get the right per­son to see that you are se­ri­ous. Speak from the heart.</p>
