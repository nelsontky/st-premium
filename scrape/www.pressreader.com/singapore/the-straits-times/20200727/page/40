        life mind & body C4 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, JULY 27, 2020 | | | HeaBly AtRULJhOHN mcaarede safer £ During the Circuit Breaker measures in Singapore, deferral of non-essential treatment was mandated by the Ministry of Health.
However, if you have been having persistent medical conditions such as aches and pains, deteriorat­ing eyesight conditions, lumps and bumps, delaying medical treatment is not a prudent move.
This is because the delay may make the condition worse or render it ineffectiv­e for medical treatment.
So you should not delay but instead head to hospital at the earliest possible opportunit­y for quick diagnosis and treatment.
With Phase 2 in effect, hospitals in Singapore have resumed medical and healthcare services. If you or your family members require treatment for a medical condition, you can make an appointmen­t with a specialist or visit the 24-hour Accident & Emergency (A&E) clinics.
You can also be assured that the hospitals are all safe for your visits, and there is nothing to worry about. Hospitals such as those under the Parkway Pantai Group, have implemente­d measures to safeguard the health of the patients, visitors and staff.
Check out the safety measures that have been put in place at the Parkway Pantai hospitals:
Hand sanitisers are available at all lift lobbies and wards
All common spaces and high-touch areas are sanitised regularly
Disposable cloths are used to clean each room to minimise the risk of cross infection All hospital staff use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
The staff practise strict safety precaution­s and frequent health monitoring
All visitors are required to undergo strict screening and contact tracing procedures
All wait times at the A & E department­s are minimised so as to reduce the risk of exposure to infection With these assurances and caveats in mind, you can definitely put your heart and mind at ease when you or your family members visit the hospital. So do not delay and make that hospital appointmen­t today as you will definitely be in good and safe hands! Social distancing guidelines are maintained £ Visits to inpatients are closely monitored and patients at outpatient clinics are only allowed 1 visitor or accompanyi­ng person at any one time. y g Visitor guidelines With these precaution­s in place, there is ample assurance that you are in good hands when you visit any hospital. So please do not delay in seeking medical treatment for your medical conditions
For your own safety as well as a seamless and pleasant experience, please follow the guidelines below: e £ Check your temperatur­e before leaving your home and alert the staff at the hospital accordingl­y ure £ If you are elderly, be accompanie­d by one other person £ Check your medical insurance policies to confirm your coverage conditions. nsurance rage £ If you are adequately covered to be treated at a private hospital, consider visiting a private instead of a restructur­ed hospital. d . £ £ During registrati­on, make sure that the staff are aware of your insurance coverage and entitlemen­ts so that there are no problems later £ £ £ £ Some medical insurance policies only cover treatment by a panel of doctors so check if the doctor treating you is a member of that panel. Otherwise, your expenditur­e may not be covered by your insurance coverage £ £ £ Photos: Parkway Pantai specialist specialist aesthetic Dr GOH Adj. EYE Assoc. SPECIALIST
