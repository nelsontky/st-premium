    <p>En­tire vil­lages were un­der wa­ter in Quang Tri prov­ince, Viet­nam, due to pro­longed heavy rain and flash flood­ing as trop­i­cal storm Nangka edged to­wards the Viet­namese coast yesterday.</p>
    <p>On­go­ing flood­ing since early this month has killed at least 28 peo­ple in Viet­nam and 11 in Cam­bo­dia, where al­most 25,000 houses and 84,000ha of crops have been dam­aged, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia.</p>
    <p>The Viet­namese disas­ter man­age­ment author­i­ties said more than 130,000 houses have been im­pacted.</p>
    <p>Off Quang Tri prov­ince, the mil­i­tary had ear­lier staged a dra­matic he­li­copter res­cue of eight fish­er­men who had been swept away by rough seas.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam is fre­quently lashed by harsh weather in the rainy sea­son be­tween June and Novem­ber, with cen­tral coastal ar­eas the most vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>HANOI/PH­NOM PENH Nearly 40 peo­ple have died in Viet­nam and Cam­bo­dia and scores more were miss­ing, in­clud­ing res­cuers, due to pro­longed heavy rain and flash flood­ing as trop­i­cal storm Nangka edged to­wards the Viet­namese coast yesterday.</p>
    <p>Heavy rain since early this month has caused deadly floods and landslides in sev­eral prov­inces in cen­tral Viet­nam and dis­placed thou­sands of peo­ple in western Cam­bo­dia, of­fi­cials and state me­dia said.</p>
    <p>The floods are ex­pected to worsen over the com­ing days, with trop­i­cal storm Nangka fore­cast to dump more rain as it makes land­fall in Viet­nam to­day.</p>
    <p>Nangka, pack­ing wind speeds of up to 100kmh, will trig­ger heavy rain of up to 400mm in parts of north­ern and cen­tral Viet­nam from to­day through Fri­day, its weather agency said.</p>
    <p>On­go­ing flood­ing has killed at least 28 peo­ple in Viet­nam, and 11 in Cam­bo­dia, where al­most 25,000 houses and 84,000ha of crops have been dam­aged, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia.</p>
    <p>The Viet­namese disas­ter man­age­ment author­i­ties said more than 130,000 houses have been affected.</p>
    <p>Seven­teen con­struc­tion work­ers were miss­ing fol­low­ing a land­slide at the site of a hy­dropower dam pro­ject in the cen­tral Viet­namese prov­ince of Thua Thien Hue, state me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional 13 peo­ple sent to res­cue the work­ers are also miss­ing, the state-run Nhan Dan news­pa­per re­ported yesterday.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc has in­structed the Defence Min­istry to send more res­cue troops to the site of the land­slide, ac­cord­ing to a gov­ern­ment state­ment.</p>
    <p>As of yesterday morn­ing, they were un­able to reach the site, the state­ment added, be­cause of high wa­ter lev­els, heavy rain and fur­ther landslides.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hong Kong and Ma­cau have kept their storm sig­nal at No. 8, the third-high­est on the scale, with disas­ter preven­tion mea­sures put in place, Xin­hua news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The warn­ing means that winds of mean speeds of 63kmh or more are ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties in Hong Kong have also shut­tered busi­nesses and closed schools af­ter the typhoon sig­nal was is­sued.</p>
    <p>Most busi­nesses close and pub­lic trans­port be­comes lim­ited when No. 8 sig­nal or above is in place.</p>
    <p>Un­der Hong Kong stock ex­change rules, trad­ing is aban­doned for the day if the sig­nal is not low­ered to No. 3 or be­low be­fore noon.</p>
    <p>A typhoon in Au­gust last dis­rupted trad­ing in the city’s US$4.9 tril­lion (S$6.7 tril­lion) stock mar­ket, though it re­opened the same day at 1.30pm.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping is set to visit Shen­zhen, neigh­bour­ing Hong Kong, this week. He is sched­uled to de­liver an ad­dress to­day and meet the lead­ers of Hong Kong and Ma­cau, the of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency said Mon­day.</p>
    <p>At noon yesterday, Nangka was cen­tred about 490km south­south-west of Hong Kong and is fore­cast to move west or west­north-west at about 22kmh to­wards the vicin­ity of Hainan Is­land and in­ten­sify grad­u­ally, the</p>
    <p>Hong Kong Ob­ser­va­tory said on its web­site.</p>
    <p>No one had sought med­i­cal treat­ment at pub­lic hos­pi­tals as of mid­morn­ing yesterday and the author­i­ties re­ceived six re­ports of fallen trees.</p>
    <p>Not since the 1960s has Hong Kong’s ob­ser­va­tory is­sued a No. 8 alert for a storm pass­ing so far away, lo­cal broad­caster RTHK re­ported, cit­ing se­nior sci­en­tific offi</p>
    <p>cer Woo Wang Chun.</p>
    <p>He still called it a “pru­dent” move be­cause Hong Kong is un­der the com­bined in­flu­ence from Nangka and a north-east monsoon, a sit­u­a­tion that causes stronger winds, ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the city raised the max­i­mum No. 10 sig­nal when Typhoon Mangkhut left roads blocked, buildings dam­aged and low-ly­ing ar­eas flooded.</p>
