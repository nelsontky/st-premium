    <p>A Nanyang Polytech­nic (NYP) stu­dent met a school­mate on cam­pus in June last year to pass her a piece of ly­sergide or LSD as she was cu­ri­ous about the hal­lu­cino­genic drug.</p>
    <p>Ally Tan Ya Teng, 18, gave a to­ken sum of $1 to Saahil Ma­hesh Thadani for the drug.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ci­dent at NYP, Saahil sold LSD to another school­mate Tahsh D Khem­lani, 19, for $40.</p>
    <p>Saahil also gave the drug to a third school­mate who was 17 years old at the time and can­not be named as teenagers un­der 18 are cov­ered un­der the Chil­dren and Young Per­sons Act.</p>
    <p>All four stu­dents are Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>As a young of­fender, Saahil was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to at least a year of re­for­ma­tive train­ing.</p>
    <p>This means he will be de­tained at a cen­tre and made to fol­low a strict reg­i­men that in­cludes foot drills as well as coun­selling.</p>
    <p>Saahil, now 20, had ear­lier pleaded guilty to one count each of traf­fick­ing LSD and be­ing in pos­ses­sion of the drug.</p>
    <p>The out­come of the cases in­volv­ing the three other stu­dents were not re­vealed in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau stated on its web­site that LSD is a hal­lu­cino­gen “of­ten sold on blot­ting pa­per which is usu­ally im­printed with a colour­ful car­toon or de­sign”.</p>
    <p>Saahil bought LSD from an on­line plat­form on at least two oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Saahil had in­tended to traf­fic the drug to any­one who wished to buy or try them.</p>
    <p>He had also planned to sell half the sup­ply to earn ex­tra pocket money and keep the re­main­der for his per­sonal con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>He passed Tan the drug while they were at school some­time be­tween 4pm and 5pm on June 22 last year.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not reveal how his of­fences came to light but NYP found out about the in­ci­dent in­volv­ing Tan.</p>
    <p>Its stu­dent de­vel­op­ment of­fice in­ter­viewed Saahil at around 7pm on June 24 last year.</p>
    <p>Po­lice ar­rested Tan and Saahil about an hour later.</p>
    <p>For traf­fick­ing LSD, an of­fender can be jailed for up to 20 years and re­ceive up to 15 strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>Saahil is still an NYP stu­dent and a polytech­nic spokesman said dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings will now be con­vened to mete out ap­pro­pri­ate sanc­tions.</p>
