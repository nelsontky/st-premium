    <p>The South Pa­cific Gyre is the spot in the sea that is far­ther from land than any other, so de­void of nu­tri­ents, life and even con­ti­nen­tal dust that it is con­sid­ered “the dead­est spot in the ocean”, said Dr Steven D’Hondt, a ge­omi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist at the Univer­sity of Rhode Is­land.</p>
    <p>Yet some 6,100m be­neath the sur­face, mi­cro­scopic crea­tures have not only found a way to eke out a liv­ing, but they have also man­aged to weather the in­hos­pitable con­di­tions for many mil­lions of years.</p>
    <p>In a pa­per pub­lished in Na­ture Com­mu­ni­ca­tions this week, Dr D’Hondt and his col­leagues de­scribe the re­mark­able re­vival of a small pop­u­la­tion of mi­crobes that may have spent the past 101.5 mil­lion years en­sconced in a slum­ber un­der sed­i­ments deep below the gyre – only to be roused awake in the lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>If con­firmed, these mi­crobes could be among the old­est liv­ing or­gan­isms ever found. Spawned dur­ing a time when the non-avian di­nosaurs still stalked the earth, these hi­ber­nat­ing cells might have rested as the con­ti­nents creaked into their modern con­fig­u­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Such longevity is un­likely, even math­e­mat­i­cally im­pos­si­ble within the con­straints of some mod­els, said Dr Yuki Morono, a mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist at the Ja­pan Agency for MarineEart­h Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy, or Jam­stec, and an author of the study. “No the­o­ret­i­cal mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy can ex­plain it. But we found it.”</p>
    <p>Other sci­en­tists have, mean­while, un­earthed snooz­ing mi­crobes from harsh en­vi­ron­ments be­neath the seafloor in the past.</p>
    <p>Crushed by miles of wa­ter and mud and starved of food, sun­light as well as warmth, cells must adapt or per­ish.</p>
    <p>Those that adapt can some­times avoid death by sim­ply tee­ter­ing on the verge of it.</p>
    <p>A team led by Dr Fu­mio Ina­gaki, also of Jam­stec, set sail into the south­ern Pa­cific Ocean in 2010 and drilled deep into its sed­i­ments.</p>
    <p>Even Dr Morono was scep­ti­cal of find­ing life in the most an­cient parts of the mucky, nu­tri­ent-poor cores the team ex­tracted.</p>
    <p>But as he con­tin­ued to sam­ple back­ward in time, it be­came clear that there were mi­crobes all the way down.</p>
    <p>Dr Morono had ex­pected that the mi­crobes would be slow to rise. But within just a few days, some of the groggy germs had started to di­vide. For nearly two years, the re­searchers watched their spec­i­mens grow.</p>
    <p>The mi­crobes’ new-found vi­vac­ity hints that for mil­lions of years, they were “just kind of wait­ing for con­di­tions to im­prove”, said Dr Vir­ginia Edg­comb, a ge­omi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist at Woods Hole Oceano­graphic In­sti­tu­tion who was not in­volved in the study.</p>
