    <p>Anx­i­ety in Mil­wau­kee over Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo stay­ing with the Bucks be­yond this sea­son con­tin­ues to rise.</p>
    <p>The ru­mour mill has gone into over­drive as the “Greek Freak” faces an Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion-im­posed dead­line of Dec 21 to de­cide whether he will sign a “su­per­max” con­tract.</p>
    <p>He can choose to re­main with the team who hold the best reg­u­lar-sea­son record for the past two years but have failed to carry over that form into the play-offs.</p>
    <p>He can also roll the dice and con­sider en­ter­ing free agency after the 2020-21 sea­son, with the Bucks – whose sole cham­pi­onship came 49 years ago – last reach­ing the Fi­nals in 1974.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the NBA Most Valu­able Player of the past two sea­sons said on Wed­nes­day he had locked in on the up­com­ing sea­son, and not his much-dis­cussed fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“Right now, I am not fo­cused on that,” he said. “I am just try­ing to fo­cus on my­self.”</p>
    <p>The Bucks can of­fer the for­ward a five-year, US$228.2 mil­lion (S$305.4 mil­lion) deal that would in­crease to US$243.7 mil­lion if the league salary cap re­turns to preCovid lev­els, but teams across the league, in­clud­ing last sea­son’s fi­nal­ists, the Mi­ami Heat, are said to be keen on a trade.</p>
    <p>His cur­rent, ex­pir­ing deal was worth US$100 mil­lion for four years. But An­te­tok­oun­mpo said he was leav­ing any con­tract talks to</p>
    <p>his agent, Alex Sarat­sis.</p>
    <p>Be­fore re­port­ing to train­ing camp last week, the 26-year-old told Greek TV that he was open to team­ing up with another su­per­star</p>
    <p>– as LeBron James did with An­thony Davis last sea­son – if it means win­ning the cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“This is a state­ment that I have never made be­fore. If LeBron and</p>
    <p>Kevin Du­rant and An­thony Davis came to Mil­wau­kee, I would have been good with that,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I am not in­ter­ested if I am the top, sec­ond or third name, okay? Be­cause I want to win. I want to win be­cause when I re­tire, that’s what peo­ple will re­mem­ber. I don’t care if I am the top (player).”</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo could also find him­self play­ing with James Har­den. The Ath­letic re­ported yes­ter­day that the Hous­ton Rock­ets All-Star of­fi­cially made a trade de­mand and he in­cluded the Bucks and the Mi­ami Heat on a new list of des­ti­na­tions he would pre­fer.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami could of­fer a blend of young play­ers and draft picks to en­tice Hous­ton, but they could also hold their cash and as­sets for a chance to land An­te­tok­oun­mpo.</p>
    <p>Har­den could fill a role as a vol­ume scorer with ei­ther team. His style of play, how­ever, may not be a pre­cise fit for Jimmy But­ler’s Mi­ami, who have a swing of­fence pred­i­cated on ball move­ment and also thrive on de­fence.</p>
