    <p>TOKYO • The lead­ers of Osaka, Ky­oto and Hyogo pre­fec­tures in western Ja­pan said yes­ter­day they saw a need for a state of emer­gency amid ris­ing Covid-19 num­bers.</p>
    <p>All three pre­fec­tures busted their one-day tal­lies yes­ter­day, with 607 cases in Osaka, 284 in Hyogo and 143 in Ky­oto.</p>
    <p>“There are clear signs that in­fec­tions are spread­ing. We must take the ini­tia­tive rather than j ust hope for the best,” Osaka Gov­er­nor Hiro­fumi Yoshimura told re­porters.</p>
    <p>He said a joint re­quest with neigh­bour­ing Ky­oto and Hyogo for an emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion may be made to the na­tional gov­ern­ment by Satur­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga told a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that he “did not think the sit­u­a­tion now war­rants any emer­gency”, but would care­fully con­sider any re­quest by con­sult­ing ex­perts.</p>
    <p>What will com­pound Mr Suga’s headache in the com­ing days is the fact that cases are surg­ing na­tion­wide. At least 19 of Ja­pan’s 47 pre­fec­tures recorded new daily highs yes­ter­day, as the coun­try set a new high of at least 7,490 new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Aichi re­set its one-day high for the sec­ond straight day with 431 cases. Gov­er­nor Hideaki Omura said if the sit­u­a­tion wors­ens, he will ask for an emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion with neigh­bour­ing Gifu pre­fec­ture.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers are tak­ing mat­ters into their own hands. Ibaraki, with a new high of 90 cases, has asked res­i­dents to avoid non-es­sen­tial out­ings and of­fered pay­outs to eater­ies and bars that close by 10pm.</p>
    <p>At least two mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties – the south-western pre­fec­ture of Miyazaki and the city of Ut­sunomiya in Tochigi pre­fec­ture – have is­sued their own emer­gency dec­la­ra­tions. Ut­sunomiya Mayor Ei­ichi Sato cited the grow­ing strain on hos­pi­tals af­ter the city saw 62.1 cases for ev­ery 100,000 peo­ple in the past week, while Miyazaki set a new one-day high of 105 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
