    <p>Amid the eco­nomic doom and gloom, busi­nesses in In­done­sia’s Batam Is­land have some­thing to cheer about af­ter a top in­vest­ment coun­cil gave the nod to the de­vel­op­ment of two spe­cial eco­nomic zones (SEZs) worth 2.2 tril­lion ru­piah (S$2.1 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The first site is at Nongsa Dig­i­tal Park, in the is­land’s up­scale north­east­ern Nongsa area, which will be ded­i­cated to dig­i­tal econ­omy and tourism, and the sec­ond is at Batam Aero Tech­nic, Lion Air Group’s fa­cil­ity ded­i­cated to air­craft main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zone Coun­cil, chaired by Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Af­fairs Air­langga Har­tarto, made the de­ci­sion dur­ing a vir­tual meet­ing of min­is­ters and se­nior of­fi­cials on July 10, where they con­cluded that both sites had the po­ten­tial to cre­ate em­ploy­ment and boost eco­nomic growth, among other things.</p>
    <p>“We have agreed to grant them the Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zone sta­tus as they have ful­filled all the re­quire­ments,” said Mr Air­langga in a state­ment posted on the coun­cil’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the coun­cil has sub­mit­ted its rec­om­men­da­tion to Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, who is set to ap­prove it via a gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>An hour by ferry from Sin­ga­pore, Batam to­gether with Bin­tan and Karimun is­lands form what is col­lec­tively known as the BBK free trade zone (FTZ).</p>
    <p>Al­ready be­lea­guered with stag­nant growth and fall­ing in­vest­ments in re­cent years, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has fur­ther bat­tered busi­nesses there, which are heav­ily de­pen­dent on Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Ngu­rah Swa­jaya said the SEZs are “good news es­pe­cially for Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses be­cause BBK has a spe­cial mean­ing for Sin­ga­pore­ans”.</p>
    <p>The hope is that this will spur in­ter­na­tional as well as Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses to “se­ri­ously con­sider” in­vest­ing in Batam.</p>
    <p>“With this SEZ sta­tus, of course there will be a lot of in­cen­tives, ben­e­fits, and there will be some sort of spe­cial treat­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>An en­hanced SEZ sta­tus for the two zones would of­fer ad­di­tional fis­cal in­cen­tives re­lated to trade and in­vest­ments, such as tax breaks, to busi­nesses and in­come tax re­lief for work­ers. An FTZ of­fers only non-fis­cal in­cen­tives to in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Mr Marco Bardelli, se­nior ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Nongsa Dig­i­tal Park, has wel­comed the “great news”.</p>
    <p>The tech­nol­ogy park, touted as a dig­i­tal bridge be­tween In­done­sia and Sin­ga­pore, has around 100 tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies hir­ing more than 1,200 em­ploy­ees in the vicin­ity. It is also in talks with five data cen­tre de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>“Data cen­tres are in­vest­ments worth tens of mil­lions of dol­lars. It will be favourable to in­cen­tivise them since they are very much needed in the ex­pan­sion of dig­i­tal econ­omy across In­done­sia,” Mr Bardelli told ST.</p>
    <p>As many of the smaller dig­i­tal com­pa­nies are not cap­i­tal in­ten­sive, he hopes the gov­ern­ment would be able to pro­vide in­cen­tives that could help lower set-up costs for them. Al­though the coro­n­avirus pan­demic prompted some com­pa­nies to cut their man­power, it also spurred oth­ers to hire more as the de­mand for on­line ser­vices soared.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses and po­ten­tial in­vestors told ST that they had cho­sen Batam for its safe ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion away from earth­quake fault lines, and its prox­im­ity to Sin­ga­pore. Its des­ig­na­tion as a SEZ has ce­mented their con­fi­dence in in­vest­ing in Batam.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Tong Hai, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of SEAX Global, a Sin­ga­pore­based sub­ma­rine cable con­nec­tiv­ity ser­vices whole­saler which has a cable route be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Batam, hopes the SEZ would pro­vide clar­ity on rules such as cor­po­rate tax, in­come tax on busi­ness trav­ellers, and data own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>“We do hope that with the es­tab­lish­ment of the SEZ, Nongsa Dig­i­tal Park plans will take off and we can also ride with the growth to pro­vide more con­nec­tiv­ity ser­vices to our cus­tomers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Eti­salat, a tele­coms group based in the United Arab Emi­rates, is look­ing with in­ter­est at the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of Batam, said the com­pany’s head of Asia, Mr Dino Civ­itarese.</p>
    <p>He said: “With more con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween Batam, Sin­ga­pore and the Mid­dle East, data flow will only in­crease. And bet­ter in­fra­struc­ture such as state-of-the-art data cen­tres in Nongsa will also help to ac­com­mo­date the in­creas­ing de­mand for con­tent stor­age in the re­gion.”</p>
