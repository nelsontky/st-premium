    <p>When lion dance troupes per­form dur­ing Chi­nese New Year, it takes a skilled “tail” to peel or­anges and use the seg­ments to form an aus­pi­cious char­ac­ter on the ground, while an en­er­getic “head” dis­tracts the crowd.</p>
    <p>A seam­less per­for­mance is key, says Mr Chan Yew Kay, 64, se­nior ad­viser of the Sin­ga­pore Hok San As­so­ci­a­tion and vet­eran lion dance in­struc­tor. Once the au­di­ence no­tices what is go­ing on be­neath the cos­tume, the spell is bro­ken.</p>
    <p>So this tour is a unique op­por­tu­nity to peer be­neath the head, lift the tail, clash the cym­bals and find out about the in­ner work­ings of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est lion dance troupe, which cel­e­brated its 100th an­niver­sary last year.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants will delve into the troupe’s his­tory and can try out var­i­ous as­pects of the per­for­mance, such as learn­ing how to lift and move the lion’s head.</p>
    <p>This is made of bam­boo ribs, with the mouth and eye­lids con­trolled by flaps and strings, and weighs about 3kg. Lift­ing it is the easy part – it is trick­ier to mimic fe­line be­hav­iour, such as turn­ing sharply as the lion catches sight of prey.</p>
    <p>In fact, when Mr Chan first learnt lion danc­ing as a 12-year-old, he had to study the be­hav­iour of a kit­ten for months be­fore even pick­ing up the cos­tume. “You have to in­ter­nalise the move­ments of a cat – the way it stalks prey or leaps,” says the for­mer se­nior tech­ni­cian at an oil re­fin­ery, who re­tired in April this year.</p>
    <p>These are some anec­dotes mem­bers will share on the tour, held at the as­so­ci­a­tion’s Kreta Ayer shop­house.</p>
    <p>The troupe, whose f ound­ing mem­bers were mostly from the He­shan mu­nic­i­pal­ity in China, moved to Sin­ga­pore in the 1920s to work pri­mar­ily as labour­ers.</p>
    <p>In the 1950s, they in­tro­duced skits as part of their per­for­mances, which were held at en­ter­tain­ment parks such as Gay World and New World as well as the Na­tional Theatre.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, they have been at­tract­ing fresh blood by boost­ing their so­cial me­dia pres­ence. The 60-mem­ber troupe now has about 25 mem­bers un­der the age of 30. Mr Chan says: “We want to share what we do with so­ci­ety and get more people in­ter­ested in the art form.”</p>
