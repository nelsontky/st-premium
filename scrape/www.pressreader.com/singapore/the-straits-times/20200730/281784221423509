    <p>A 10-year-old boy was among four im­ported Covid-19 cases an­nounced yes­ter­day by the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The In­dian na­tional is a stu­dent’s pass holder who ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore on July 14 from In­dia.</p>
    <p>Among the three other im­ported cases, one is a 36-year-old Sin­ga­porean wo­man who ar­rived from In­dia on July 17.</p>
    <p>An­other is a 26-year-old Filipino work pass holder who is em­ployed here and ar­rived from the Philip­pines on July 15.</p>
    <p>The last im­ported case, an 18-year-old male In­done­sian who is a stu­dent’s pass holder, ar­rived from In­done­sia on July 17.</p>
    <p>All four im­ported pa­tients were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties. They were tested while serv­ing their no­tices and all four were con­firmed to have Covid-19 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The three com­mu­nity cases re­ported yes­ter­day com­prise two Sin­ga­pore­ans and a work pass holder. All three were linked to pre­vi­ous cases or clus­ters, and were quar­an­tined ear­lier.</p>
    <p>They were tested dur­ing quar­an­tine to de­ter­mine their sta­tus, even though they were asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 327 of 334 new coron­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s total to 51,531.</p>
    <p>MOH said that it con­tin­ues to pick up cases among work per­mit hold­ers re­sid­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, in­clud­ing in fac­tory-con­verted dor­mi­to­ries, be­cause of ex­ten­sive test­ing in these premises, as part of the min­istry’s process to ver­ify and test the sta­tus of all work­ers.</p>
    <p>It also said that 24 clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries were closed as they were cleared, and now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from nine cases two weeks ago to four in the past week. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of five cases to two over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 205 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 46,083 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A total of 184 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 5,222 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None are in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
