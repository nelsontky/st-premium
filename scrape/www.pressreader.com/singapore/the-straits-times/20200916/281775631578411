    <p>• Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s plan to re­nege on part of the Brexit divorce deal passed its first hur­dle in Par­lia­ment late on Mon­day after a bruis­ing de­bate in which se­nior mem­bers of his own party de­nounced the move.</p>
    <p>The House of Com­mons passed the In­ter­nal Mar­ket Bill by 340 to 263 in its first main vote, allowing it to go through to the next stage in the par­lia­men­tary process to­day.</p>
    <p>The prime min­is­ter said the pro­posed leg­is­la­tion, which will re­write part of the With­drawal Agree­ment, is “essen­tial” to main­tain Britain’s eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal in­tegrity.</p>
    <p>He ac­cused the Euro­pean Union of mak­ing “ab­surd” threats to stop food mov­ing from main­land Great Britain to North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>“It is such an ex­tra­or­di­nary threat,” Mr John­son told MPs. “It seems so in­cred­i­ble the EU could do this, that we are not tak­ing pow­ers in this Bill to neu­tralise that threat, but ob­vi­ously re­serve the right to do so if these threats per­sist.”</p>
    <p>His de­ci­sion to rip up part of an in­ter­na­tional deal he signed less than a year ago has al­ready pitched the Brexit ne­go­ti­a­tions into tur­moil. The EU has threat­ened le­gal ac­tion and called on him to with­draw the Bill by the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Press­ing on would risk jeop­ar­dis­ing ef­forts to se­cure a deal with the bloc be­fore the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ex­pires at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>While Mr John­son had a com­fort­able ma­jor­ity in Mon­day night’s vote, he will face a big­ger ob­sta­cle in the House of Lords, where Tory grandees in­clud­ing for­mer leader Michael Howard have de­nounced the leg­is­la­tion and could de­lay its progress.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers on both sides said the gov­ern­ment’s ad­mis­sion that the pro­posed leg­is­la­tion would breach in­ter­na­tional law will weaken Britain’s at­tempts to call other coun­tries – in­clud­ing Rus­sia, China and Zim­babwe – to ac­count.</p>
    <p>“Britain has been a bea­con in some very dif­fi­cult places of the world for sup­port for the rule of law, and our sup­port is re­lied upon,” said for­mer Tory In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Sec­re­tary An­drew Mitchell. “We have a duty to up­hold the rule of law.”</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tive for­mer at­tor­neysgen­eral Ge­of­frey Cox and Jeremy Wright said they would not back a Bill that breaks in­ter­na­tional law, and were joined by for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter Sa­jid Javid.</p>
    <p>Mr Rehman Chishti, Mr John­son’s spe­cial en­voy for free­dom of religion or be­lief, has quit, say­ing he could not vote for the plan.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand how some peo­ple will feel un­ease over the use of these pow­ers, and... I have ab­so­lutely no de­sire to use these mea­sures,” Mr John­son said. “They are an in­sur­ance pol­icy, and if we reach agree­ment with our Euro­pean friends – which I still be­lieve is pos­si­ble – they will never be in­voked.”</p>
