    <p>The race to find an ef­fec­tive vac­cine ap­pears to be on the home straight. The same can­not be said of the race to roll it out ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>Pre­par­ing to present a BBC ra­dio se­ries ti­tled How To Vac­ci­nate The World, I’ve been look­ing at the route ahead. It is less of a marathon, more of an as­sault course.</p>
    <p>So, in no par­tic­u­lar or­der, here is a brief guide to some of the ob­sta­cles that re­main.</p>
    <p>EF­FI­CACY (1)</p>
    <p>Do th­ese vac­cines – of which there are more than a hun­dred in prospect and about a dozen in last-stage devel­op­ment – ac­tu­ally work?</p>
    <p>The re­cent an­nounce­ments that the Pfizer/BioNTech vac­cine ap­pears to be 95 per cent ef­fec­tive and the Moderna one al­most the same are very en­cour­ag­ing and bode well for other vac­cines. The good news from Pfizer may be even bet­ter than it ap­pears – read­ing be­tween the lines, some statis­ti­cians spec­u­late that the ef­fi­cacy is closer to 97 per cent.</p>
    <p>But the fact that ev­ery nerd in the world is try­ing to re­verse-en­gi­neer the ac­tual num­bers be­hind Pfizer’s press state­ment is cause for con­cern.</p>
    <p>It’s un­der­stand­able that the an­nounce­ment came by a press state­ment rather than a peer-re­viewed pa­per; the news was just too big to be kept se­cret while drafts were cir­cu­lated. But more data should have been re­leased sooner.</p>
    <p>PRO­DUC­TION LINES</p>
    <p>A vac­cine is one of the most com­plex prod­ucts in the world to pro­duce, and the process of scal­ing up from tens of thousands of doses for a trial to hun­dreds of mil­lions for mass vac­ci­na­tion is not a triv­ial one.</p>
    <p>EF­FI­CACY (2)</p>
    <p>Will th­ese vac­cines make peo­ple less in­fec­tious or will they sim­ply pre­vent se­vere ill­ness? Ei­ther would be good, but pre­vent­ing the spread of in­fec­tion would be ideal. The Pfizer press state­ment leaves us guess­ing for now.</p>
    <p>Since the Sars-CoV-2 virus ac­cu­mu­lates in the up­per re­s­pi­ra­tory tract be­fore caus­ing symp­toms, there is a real risk that vac­cines will not pre­vent peo­ple from spread­ing the virus even if</p>
    <p>they are largely im­mune to the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>MISS­ING LINKS</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the pan­demic, test­ing ca­pac­ity was lim­ited by the avail­abil­ity of suit­able swabs. It’s of­ten the sim­ple stuff that trips us up. There were fears of a short­age of glass vials, but this was pre­dicted and is be­ing ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>But now trade pub­li­ca­tion Gas­world re­ports an “acute” short­age of dry ice, thanks to in­creased de­mand for food preser­va­tion this year. That’s a prob­lem, be­cause dry ice is also use­ful for keep­ing vac­cines cold.</p>
    <p>LO­GIS­TICS</p>
    <p>In a ma­jor and un­der-ap­pre­ci­ated mir­a­cle, more than 85 per cent of chil­dren are now fully vac­ci­nated against diph­the­ria, tetanus and per­tus­sis. Rates of vac­ci­na­tion for tu­ber­cu­lo­sis, po­lio, hep­ati­tis B and measles are sim­i­larly im­pres­sive.</p>
    <p>So the cold chain needed to main­tain many vac­cines, which is the tem­per­a­ture of a beer fridge, is well es­tab­lished. We even have cold chains de­vel­oped to sup­port the dis­tri­bu­tion of the po­lio vac­cine, which needs to be kept at mi­nus 20 deg C, a tem­per­a­ture achiev­able by a do­mes­tic freezer.</p>
    <p>But the new Pfizer/BioNTech vac­cine needs to be kept at mi­nus 70 deg C. This ul­tra-cold chain will not be triv­ial to main­tain.</p>
    <p>BREXIT</p>
    <p>I don’t want to kill the mood but the ad­vis­ers sur­round­ing Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son have been fight­ing like rats in a bar­rel. They seem woe­fully un­der­pre­pared for – or per­haps in­dif­fer­ent to – the prospect of a no-deal Brexit on New Year’s Day.</p>
    <p>The chem­i­cals in­dus­try is se­ri­ously wor­ried that cross-bor­der trans­fers of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal drugs and other</p>
    <p>chem­i­cals will be badly dis­rupted. If there is a fight to al­lo­cate sy­ringes, vials or other hith­erto over­looked com­po­nents in the sup­ply chain, I worry that Bri­tain has made few friends in the past four years.</p>
    <p>And even if there is noth­ing to worry about ex­cept a queue at the bor­der, the Pfizer vac­cine is go­ing to be man­u­fac­tured in Bel­gium and Ger­many and, re­mem­ber, needs to be stored at a tem­per­a­ture of mi­nus 70 deg C. Calais can get cold in Jan­uary but it doesn’t get that cold.</p>
    <p>CROWD CON­TROL</p>
    <p>It would be nice if each vac­cine were stored in a sin­gle-dose pack. A pa­tient could stroll up to a clinic and get vac­ci­nated at a con­ve­nient mo­ment. But the ul­tra-cold chain will rely on fancy “ther­mal ship­pers” stor­ing a thou­sand doses or more; each glass vial will con­tain five or 10 doses.</p>
    <p>Break the seal on a big batch of vac­cines and you’re go­ing to want a large num­ber of peo­ple com­ing through the door in short or­der.</p>
    <p>Get­ting so­cially dis­tanced peo­ple in the right place at the right time for their shots, es­pe­cially in ru­ral ar­eas, may not be easy.</p>
    <p>PA­PER­WORK</p>
    <p>Most of the se­ri­ous vac­cine can­di­dates re­quire two doses. Not only do we have to fig­ure out who is get­ting vac­ci­nated when, but we need to get them back again for a se­cond dose 21 days later. If this sounds like it shouldn’t be too much trou­ble for a mod­ern health­care sys­tem to han­dle, then I have an ob­so­lete ver­sion of Mi­crosoft Ex­cel to sell you.</p>
    <p>EF­FI­CACY (3)</p>
    <p>How long does im­mu­nity last? Hav­ing to vac­ci­nate the en­tire planet ev­ery six months would be</p>
    <p>quite a per­for­mance. Let’s hope the vac­cine works for a longer pe­riod than that, but for ob­vi­ous rea­sons it is far too early to tell.</p>
    <p>THE DON­ALD</p>
    <p>Yes, him. US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was prom­i­nent in spread­ing the false idea that vac­cines cause autism, but last year changed his tune, urg­ing peo­ple “to get the shots”. Would an em­bit­tered Mr Trump, ea­ger to spite his suc­ces­sor and win at­ten­tion for his fu­ture me­dia or po­lit­i­cal ca­reer, be­come a prom­i­nent anti-vaxxer again? To ask the ques­tion is to an­swer it.</p>
    <p>Don’t be de­pressed about this far from ex­haus­tive list. It is a mir­a­cle that, less than a year af­ter the virus was se­quenced, we seem to have two ef­fec­tive vac­cines and many more on the way.</p>
    <p>I am ex­cited and op­ti­mistic. But this story has a few twists in it yet.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A re&#xAD;searcher work&#xAD;ing in a lab run by Moderna, which says its ex&#xAD;per&#xAD;i&#xAD;men&#xAD;tal vac&#xAD;cine is 94.5 per cent ef&#xAD;fec&#xAD;tive in pre&#xAD;vent&#xAD;ing Covid-19 based on in&#xAD;terim data from a late-stage trial. A vac&#xAD;cine is one of the world&#x2019;s most com&#xAD;plex prod&#xAD;ucts to pro&#xAD;duce, says the writer, and the process of scal&#xAD;ing up from tens of thousands of doses for a trial to hun&#xAD;dreds of mil&#xAD;lions for mass vac&#xAD;ci&#xAD;na&#xAD;tion is not triv&#xAD;ial.</p>
