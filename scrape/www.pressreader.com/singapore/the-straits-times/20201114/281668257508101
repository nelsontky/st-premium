    <p>Coro­n­avirus cases have been on a down­ward trend in In­dia, but the cap­i­tal city of Delhi is see­ing a third wave of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The city on Wed­nes­day recorded a new high of 8,593 new cases, up from around 2,000 cases a day in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, it recorded 7,053 new cases and 104 deaths, the high­est num­ber of deaths in a day.</p>
    <p>The Delhi High Court warned that the city could be­come the Covid-19 cap­i­tal of the coun­try even as re­ports are emerg­ing of fast-fill­ing hospi­tal beds.</p>
    <p>The court on Thurs­day al­lowed the gov­ern­ment to re­serve 80 per cent of the in­ten­sive care unit beds in 33 pri­vate hos­pi­tals for Covid-19 pa­tients, even as half of the city’s 16,614 beds re­served for them are now oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>Of 1,328 ICU beds with ven­ti­la­tors, 1,156 are taken.</p>
    <p>Delhi Chief Min­is­ter Arvind Ke­jri­wal main­tained that the si­t­u­a­tion would im­prove in seven to 10 days but did not of­fer any rea­sons.</p>
    <p>In­dia, which had a strin­gent lock­down, re­mains the sec­ond most af­fected coun­try af­ter the United States.</p>
    <p>Still, the over­all num­ber of cases has fallen.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, 44,879 new cases were recorded, com­pared with over 80,000 a day in early Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The na­tional re­cov­ery rate is 92.97 per cent, based on gov­ern­ment data.</p>
    <p>The fall in cases is seen to be com­ing from states like Ma­ha­rash­tra.</p>
    <p>But Delhi, which has a pop­u­la­tion of more than 19.8 mil­lion, has strug­gled to con­trol the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It has a to­tal of 467,000 cases and a death toll of 7,332.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor K. Sri­nath Reddy, pres­i­dent of the Pub­lic Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia, said: “Delhi has his­tor­i­cally been de­stroyed and re­built seven times...</p>
    <p>“It also seems des­tined to be in­vaded by Covid-19 many times.</p>
    <p>“It is now go­ing through the third cy­cle of rise and fall in the case counts since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery time the re­straints are re­laxed, there is a ten­dency to crowd in the mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>He added that the fes­tive sea­son last month and this month co­in­cides with the ad­vent of win­ter and a rise in air pol­lu­tion lev­els.</p>
    <p>“To­gether with the su­per­spreader events fu­elled by shop­ping sprees for fes­tive dis­counts, th­ese fac­tors give the virus a huge scope for spread,” he said.</p>
    <p>The city’s Covid-19 trou­bles have in­ten­si­fied due to the an­nual spike in pol­lu­tion dur­ing win­ter, brought on by stub­ble burn­ing to clear farm­land in neigh­bour­ing states.</p>
    <p>This, ex­ac­er­bated by ve­hic­u­lar and in­dus­trial pol­lu­tion, takes the air qual­ity in­dex into the very poor cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>The In­dian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion has warned that one in eight Covid-19 cases could be linked to pol­lu­tion, which stud­ies have shown raises the risks of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>It said: “In­creased air pol­lu­tion leads to in­creased in­flam­ma­tory re­sponse, and 13 per cent of the in­crease (in Covid-19 cases) has been es­ti­mated to be due to pol­lu­tion.”</p>
    <p>A study pub­lished in the Car­dio­vas­cu­lar Re­search jour­nal said long-term ex­po­sure to air pol­lu­tion could be linked to 15 per cent of Covid-19 deaths glob­ally.</p>
    <p>A Har­vard study re­cently found that some­one liv­ing in an area of high-par­tic­u­late pol­lu­tion is 8 per cent more likely to die from Covid-19 than oth­ers in ar­eas with less pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Across Delhi, the lead-up to Deep­avali has seen crowds in mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Dr San­deep Sharma, a doc­tor in South Delhi, said peo­ple were no longer scared of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“I feel that the fear fac­tor is prob­a­bly gone. Now peo­ple are tak­ing it lightly. They know the coro­n­avirus is there to stay and they have to live with it. The re­stric­tions are gone, so peo­ple are meet­ing and par­ty­ing,” said Dr Sharma.</p>
    <p>“And that is the rea­son we are get­ting more and more pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts warned of a fes­tive surge in other parts of North In­dia.</p>
    <p>Prof Reddy said: “Over­all, In­dia has been main­tain­ing a steady de­cline in the rates of Covid-19 cases and deaths since Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, North In­dia faces the dan­ger of a se­vere win­ter, high air pol­lu­tion lev­els and long fes­tive sea­sons, which spur crowded cel­e­bra­tions and fren­zied shop­ping in ur­ban ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The dan­ger of a fresh virus surge has to be con­tained through strong pub­lic health mea­sures which call for res­o­lute reg­u­la­tory mea­sures and in­di­vid­ual mea­sures for per­sonal pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The virus must not be per­mit­ted to dom­i­nate our lives when the cal­en­dar changes to 2021.”</p>
