    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump (left) pres­sured Ge­or­gia’s top elec­tion of­fi­cial, a fel­low Repub­li­can, in an ex­tra­or­di­nary phone con­ver­sa­tion to “find” enough votes to over­turn Mr Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory in the state. The call raised the prospect that Mr Trump may have vi­o­lated laws that pro­hibit in­ter­fer­ence in elec­tions.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump urged Ge­or­gia elec­tion of­fi­cials to “find” thou­sands of votes and re­cal­cu­late the elec­tion re­sult to flip the state to him – an ex­tra­or­di­nary ef­fort to strong-arm fel­low Repub­li­cans as he tries to dis­pute Mr Joe Bi­den’s elec­tion win.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also trav­elled to Ge­or­gia yes­ter­day in a bid to keep the US Se­nate in the hands of his Repub­li­can Party, af­ter his ef­forts to over­turn his own de­feat in the state have in­jected new un­cer­tainty into a pair of races that are seen as too close to call.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den will also travel to Ge­or­gia for a last-minute rally ahead of to­day’s run-off elec­tions, which pit a pair of in­cum­bent Repub­li­can sen­a­tors against two Demo­cratic chal­lengers.</p>
    <p>If Repub­li­cans Kelly Lo­ef­fler and David Per­due suc­cess­fully de­fend their seats, their party would main­tain a 52-seat ma­jor­ity i n the 100-seat Se­nate, giv­ing them the power to block much of Mr Bi­den’s agenda when he takes of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>A sweep by Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Os­soff would hand con­trol to Mr Bi­den’s party, as Vice Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris would hold the tiebreak­ing vote in the 50-50 cham­ber.</p>
    <p>That would make it eas­ier for Mr Bi­den to en­act fur­ther coro­n­avirus re­lief and tackle cli­mate change, as Democrats also con­trol the House of Representa­tives.</p>
    <p>None of the can­di­dates won a ma­jor­ity in their Novem­ber races, which spurred the run-off elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den nar­rowly won Ge­or­gia in Novem­ber, break­ing years of Repub­li­can dom­i­nance in the state.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­fused to ac­knowl­edge his de­feat and his cam­paign has un­suc­cess­fully sought to over­turn the re­sults in Ge­or­gia and sev­eral other bat­tle­ground states.</p>
    <p>In a 62-minute call last Satur­day, Mr Trump os­cil­lated from flat­tery to threats as he pressed of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Ge­or­gia Sec­re­tary of State Brad Raf­fensperger, to take ac­tion in his favour just days be­fore Congress is set to cer­tify the elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s voice – and that of his Chief of Staff Mark Mead­ows – was heard in an au­dio record­ing of the call that was ob­tained by Bloomberg News. Ex­cerpts of the call were pub­lished ear­lier on Sun­day by The Wash­ing­ton Post.</p>
    <p>“Look, all I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes,” Mr Trump told Mr Raf­fensperger.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial re­count has af­firmed that Mr Bi­den beat Mr Trump by 11,779 votes in the state.</p>
    <p>“Flip­ping the state is a great tes­ta­ment to our coun­try. It’s a tes­ta­ment that they can ad­mit to a mis­take,” said Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Raf­fensperger re­sponded: “The chal­lenge that you have is that the data you have is wrong.”</p>
    <p>Mr Raf­fensperger was asked on ABC news yes­ter­day whether he felt in­tim­i­dated by the call.</p>
    <p>“No, we have to fol­low the process, fol­low the law,” he replied.</p>
    <p>Among a swift wave of back­lash, Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Adam Schiff, chair­man of the House In­tel­li­gence</p>
    <p>Com­mit­tee, termed Mr Trump’s ac­tions “po­ten­tially crim­i­nal, and an­other fla­grant abuse of power”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s call threat­ened to deepen grow­ing re­sent­ment to­wards him within his own party, as sev­eral Repub­li­cans believe he was un­der­min­ing con­fi­dence in Ge­or­gia’s elec­tion process days ahead of the run-off elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump told Mr Raf­fensperger that it was a “big risk” for him and his lawyer to not in­ter­vene.</p>
    <p>“It’s more il­le­gal for you than it is for them, be­cause you know what they did and you’re not re­port­ing it,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, the Pres­i­dent said: “The peo­ple of Ge­or­gia are an­gry, the peo­ple of the coun­try are an­gry. And there’s noth­ing wrong with say­ing... that you’ve re­cal­cu­lated.”</p>
    <p>The call by Mr Trump to Mr Raf­fensperger raised the prospect that the Pres­i­dent may have vi­o­lated laws that pro­hibit in­ter­fer­ence in fed­eral or state elec­tions, but lawyers said on Sun­day it would be dif­fi­cult to pur­sue such a charge.</p>
    <p>The me­an­der­ing na­ture of the phone call and the fact that the Pres­i­dent made no ap­par­ent at­tempt to con­ceal his ac­tions as other call par­tic­i­pants lis­tened could al­low Mr Trump to ar­gue that he did not in­tend to break the law or to ar­gue that he did not know that any such fed­eral law ex­isted.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral law would also most likely re­quire that Mr Trump knew that he was push­ing Mr Raf­fensperger to fraud­u­lently change the vote count, mean­ing pros­e­cu­tors would have to prove that Mr Trump knew he was ly­ing in as­sert­ing that he was con­fi­dent he had won the elec­tion in Ge­or­gia.</p>
