    <p>Call them the an­tag­o­nists, the evil foils, the bad­dies, the bul­let catch­ers. But with­out a char­ac­ter to fear or hate, movies lose emo­tional weight. Vil­lains, too of­ten the most un­der­de­vel­oped char­ac­ters, come alive in films re­leased this week.</p>
    <p>In the open­ing scenes of the doc­u­men­tary The King­maker (PG13, 101 min­utes, opens to­day at The Pro­jec­tor, ), Mrs Imelda Mar­cos, for­mer first lady of the Philip­pines, hands out cash to the beg­gars of Manila, cluck­ing with con­cern.</p>
    <p>That act of mi­nor mu­nif­i­cence – when con­trasted with the bil­lions she and her late hus­band</p>
    <p>Fer­di­nand Mar­cos plun­dered from the trea­sury and thereby help­ing create beg­gars – is in­fu­ri­at­ing. But it sig­nals this is a work that is not afraid to take sides.</p>
    <p>This fas­ci­nat­ing char­ac­ter study of the dowa­ger, who is still ac­tive in pol­i­tics per­son­ally and through her son Bong­bong (Fer­di­nand Mar­cos Jr), cov­ers her past as a beauty queen from the prov­inces, her hus­band’s rise to power and her time as first lady in the 1960s to the 1980s, when she sought to make Mala­canang Palace – the pres­i­den­tial res­i­dence – a cen­tre of cul­ture and glam­our.</p>
    <p>That fan­tasy of a Kennedy-style Camelot came crash­ing down when Peo­ple Power protesters stormed the palace, re­veal­ing to news cam­eras her in­fa­mous shoe col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>With al­most ev­ery word she speaks, the self-pro­claimed “mother of her peo­ple” re­vises his­tory, gaslights and claims vic­tim­hood.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Lau­ren Green­field, an Amer­i­can, then cuts to an im­age or in­ter­view that tells the op­po­site story, show­ing her to be a liar.</p>
    <p>Sadly, this tac­tic only brings to mind a de­press­ing cur­rent re­al­ity: In a na­tion with a leader who boasts about mak­ing it great again, the com­fort­ing lie, once ut­tered, can­not be reined in with the truth, and Mrs Mar­cos seems to know it.</p>
    <p>Don’t let the strange ti­tle of South Korean crime thriller Beasts Claw­ing At Straws (NC16,</p>
    <p>108 min­utes, opens to­day at The Pro­jec­tor, ) put you off.</p>
    <p>This work, adapted from the 2011 Ja­panese novel of the same name, is as slick and ac­com­plished as they come.</p>
    <p>It be­longs to the canon of noirish works in which ev­ery­one is rot­ten and the only dif­fer­ence is by how much.</p>
    <p>In a se­ries of chap­ters that deal with dif­fer­ent time­lines and char­ac­ters, eight peo­ple be­come in­volved with a bag of money. As their re­la­tion­ships with one an­other be­come clearer, events get blood­ier.</p>
    <p>South Korean thrillers can be just as vi­o­lent as Western ones, but they also go where Hol­ly­wood fears to tread, such as in scenes show­ing men beat­ing and tor­tur­ing women. They can be dis­com­fit­ing to watch, but writer-di­rec­tor Kim Yong-hoon, mak­ing his fea­ture de­but, in­tends to make a point about the world in which his char­ac­ters live. The re­al­is­tic cru­elty, ex­trav­a­gant vi­o­lence and graphic novel-style black hu­mour come to­gether seam­lessly.</p>
    <p>The bad­dies in the re­al­ity-based dis­as­ter movie Fukushima 50 (PG, 122 min­utes, opens to­day, ) are the bosses of the power com­pany in charge of the Fukushima Dai­ichi nu­clear plant, which was rocked by ex­plo­sions fol­low­ing the March 2011 tsunami that struck eastern Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>These ex­ec­u­tives, in­tent on sav­ing their rep­u­ta­tions, un­der­played risks and is­sued con­fus­ing, con­tra­dic­tory in­struc­tions dur­ing the re­pair phase of the op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The suits from Tepco (Tokyo Elec­tric Power Com­pany, given a lit­i­ga­tion-proof name in the movie) are the most in­ter­est­ing part of the film, but are left un­ex­plored as char­ac­ters. In­stead, as the ti­tle sug­gests, this work cel­e­brates the 50 or so lower-level men and women who re­mained at their posts when most would have fled.</p>
    <p>So what could have been an in­ter­est­ing look at the anatomy of a dis­as­ter be­comes a repet­i­tive, pan­tomime-like reen­act­ment of brav­ery, with em­ploy­ees vol­un­teer­ing for ever more haz­ardous jobs.</p>
    <p>The ex­trav­a­gant act­ing and lack of psy­cho­log­i­cal in­sight are weary­ing, prov­ing that dis­as­ter films are best at­tempted decades af­ter the event, safely out of the reach of lawyers or the need to bur­nish one as­pect at the ex­pense of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Other films open­ing this week but not re­viewed in­clude Force Of Na­ture (NC16, 93 min­utes, opens to­day), in which an ex-cop (Mel Gib­son), his daugh­ter (Kate Bos­worth) and an­other cop, fallen from grace (Emile Hirsch), must foil rob­bers at­tempt­ing a heist in their build­ing dur­ing a hurricane.</p>
    <p>In the thriller Un­hinged (NC16, 93 min­utes, opens to­day), sin­gle mother Rachel (Caren Pis­to­rius) has a scary but all too com­mon ex­change of words with an­other driver at a stop sign. That driver, Tom (Rus­sell Crowe), as the movie’s ti­tle sug­gests, has is­sues with women and re­acts vi­o­lently.</p>
    <p>Ra­dioac­tive (NC16, 110 min­utes, opens to­day) from Ira­nian-French di­rec­tor Mar­jane Sa­trapi (the cel­e­brated an­i­ma­tion work Perse­po­lis, 2007) stars Rosamund Pike as sci­en­tist Marie Curie, the French-Pol­ish physi­cist who dis­cov­ered ra­dioac­tiv­ity.</p>
