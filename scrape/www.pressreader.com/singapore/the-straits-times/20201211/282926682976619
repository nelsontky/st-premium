    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) has signed a three-year mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing with lead­ing K-drama pro­duc­tion house Stu­dio Dragon.</p>
    <p>This is the first time Stu­dio Dragon, known for run­away hit drama se­ries such as Crash Land­ing On You (2019), Goblin (2016) and Stranger (2017 to 2020), has en­tered into an MOU with a na­tional tourism or­gan­i­sa­tion, ac­cord­ing to a press re­lease on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The deal will pro­mote Sin­ga­pore as a des­ti­na­tion in South Korea and other re­gions through the pro­duc­tion of South Korean dra­mas in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Though the Covid-19 pan­demic means that such plans will take time to ma­te­ri­alise, when travel re­stric­tions ease, Stu­dio Dragon will be film­ing K-dra­mas with the Lion City as a back­drop.</p>
    <p>STB will work with Stu­dio Dragon to de­cide on the lo­ca­tions, products and cul­tures of Sin­ga­pore to be fea­tured. There will also be joint mar­ket­ing and pro­mo­tional ac­tiv­i­ties for such dra­mas to be rolled out in phases.</p>
    <p>STB’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan said: “Korean dra­mas are im­mensely pop­u­lar around the world, and we hope this will gen­er­ate more in­ter­est and con­ver­sa­tions about Sin­ga­pore. We are con­fi­dent that this part­ner­ship will help to boost the re­cov­ery of our tourism sec­tor and in­spire more peo­ple to visit Sin­ga­pore when the time is right.”</p>
    <p>South Korea is an i mpor­tant source of tourists for Sin­ga­pore, rank­ing ninth in Sin­ga­pore’s list of top vis­i­tor sources last year.</p>
    <p>The city-state re­ceived about 646,000 South Kore­ans last year, a 3 per cent in­crease over 2018.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time the STB has worked with drama and film pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies to pro­mote Sin­ga­pore. It col­lab­o­rated with Warner Bros to pro­mote the setin-Sin­ga­pore ro­man­tic com­edy Crazy Rich Asians (2018) and also sup­ported the mar­ket­ing of the Ja­panese an­i­mated movie De­tec­tive Co­nan: The Fist Of Blue Sap­phire (2019), which is set in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
