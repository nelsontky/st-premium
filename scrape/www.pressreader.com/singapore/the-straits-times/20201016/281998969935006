    <p>Former do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani has de­cided to go ahead with her bid to start dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings against two prose­cu­tors, after be­ing given two weeks to con­sider whether she wanted to pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to me­dia queries, a spokesman for mi­grant work­ers’ group Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics (Home) said Ms Parti has “re­solved to pro­ceed” with the case. The non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion de­clined fur­ther com­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, 46, was ac­quit­ted last month by the High Court, on ap­peal, of steal­ing $34,000 worth of items from the fam­ily of prom­i­nent busi­ness­man Liew Mun Leong.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian, who was ear­lier sen­tenced to 26 months’ jail, has been stay­ing at a shel­ter run by Home since De­cem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>In June, be­fore she was ac­quit­ted, she filed an ap­pli­ca­tion seek­ing an or­der for Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tors Tan Wee Hao and Tan Yany­ing, who con­ducted her trial, to be in­ves­ti­gated be­fore a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion was heard in cham­bers by Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>At the hear­ing, her lawyer, Mr Anil Balchan­dani, said that his client con­sid­ered with­draw­ing the com­plaint as she was “torn”.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, Ms Parti be­lieves that the prose­cu­tors should an­swer the al­le­ga­tions that she has raised, said the lawyer.</p>
    <p>But on the other, she also wished to re­turn to In­done­sia as soon as pos­si­ble as she has not been home for the last four years.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice then granted a two-week ad­journ­ment for Ms Parti</p>
    <p>to de­cide whether she in­tends to pro­ceed with the case.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice also noted that Ms Parti would likely have to ap­point another lawyer if Mr Balchan­dani is to be a wit­ness in the pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>At the hear­ing, State Coun­sel</p>
    <p>Kristy Tan, for the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC), said that the DPPs in ques­tion will not ob­ject if the Chief Jus­tice refers the mat­ter for in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>The AGC has said that the two le­gal ser­vice of­fi­cers “wel­come the chance to present a full and trans­par­ent ac­count of what tran­spired dur­ing the trial”.</p>
    <p>The high-pro­file case sparked a pub­lic out­cry, with questions raised about the ev­i­dence gath­er­ing process and the way in which the trial was con­ducted.</p>
    <p>Re­views by the po­lice and AGC are ex­pected to con­clude this month.</p>
    <p>Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam has said that he in­tends to make a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment next month after these re­views are com­pleted, and will ad­dress the questions raised.</p>
    <p>One of the is­sues raised by High Court judge Chan Seng Onn in his judg­ment re­lated to a demon­stra­tion car­ried out by the DPPs on a DVD player, which Ms Parti said she was al­lowed to take as it was bro­ken.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, the DPPs showed Ms Parti that the de­vice could play a video dig­i­tally stored in the hard disk. How­ever, dur­ing the ap­peal, it was shown that the de­vice could not play DVDs.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan said that if the pros­e­cu­tion had known of this de­fect, it should have fully dis­closed it.</p>
    <p>If not, the trial court could be mis­led into think­ing that the player was in good work­ing con­di­tion when questions were put to Ms Parti.</p>
