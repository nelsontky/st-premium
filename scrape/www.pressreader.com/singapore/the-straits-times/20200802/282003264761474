    <p>Aus­tralia’s film in­dus­try has been grow­ing steadily in re­cent decades, with its sets and pro­duc­tion and ef­fects fa­cil­i­ties used for films rang­ing from the re­cent Star Wars and Harry Pot­ter se­ries to Aqua­man and Peter Rab­bit.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic has taken a heavy toll on the sec­tor, which usu­ally em­ploys tens of thou­sands of peo­ple. While an­i­ma­tion and post-pro­duc­tion work was able to con­tinue dur­ing the re­cent lock­downs, film­ing largely came to a halt.</p>
    <p>To de­liver a much-needed boost to the sec­tor, Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son has pledged A$400 mil­lion (S$393 mil­lion) in cash grants to lure Hol­ly­wood and other in­ter­na­tional film-mak­ers to pro­duce their next movies in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment hopes that Aus­tralia’s rel­a­tively low in­fec­tion rates will prove an ex­tra in­cen­tive and en­able it to host large-scale phys­i­cal pro­duc­tions. As of yes­ter­day, Aus­tralia had recorded 17,282 Covid-19 cases and 201 deaths.</p>
    <p>The scheme is ex­pected to boost Aus­tralia’s in­ter­na­tional pro­duc­tion, but crit­ics say it will do lit­tle to help the lo­cal film sec­tor, which is in des­per­ate need of support.</p>
    <p>Screen Pro­duc­ers Aus­tralia said the new in­cen­tives were wel­come and would help to gen­er­ate jobs. But it said the scheme would as­sist only about 20 per cent of the lo­cal work­force and called for ad­di­tional in­cen­tives to be of­fered for do­mes­tic pro­duc­tions, which would boost em­ploy­ment and cre­ate “great Aus­tralian cul­tural con­tent”.</p>
    <p>“(We) need to en­sure… that there are also ap­pro­pri­ate support mea­sures in place that will al­low us to con­tinue to make Aus­tralian sto­ries, told by Aus­tralian voices, sup­ported by sus­tain­able Aus­tralian pro­duc­tion busi­nesses,” the or­gan­i­sa­tion said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment be­lieves the new scheme will bring in A$3 bil­lion over the next seven years and cre­ate 8,000 new jobs a year.</p>
    <p>But Aus­tralian Writ­ers’ Guild pres­i­dent Shane Bren­nan de­scribed the scheme as a “$400 mil­lion give­away to Hol­ly­wood”.</p>
    <p>“It shows a total lack of faith in the Aus­tralian in­dus­try and Aus­tralian sto­ry­telling,” he told The Sydney Morn­ing Her­ald.</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion pro­ducer Nick Mur­ray said boost­ing the num­ber of in­ter­na­tional films made in Aus­tralia would in­crease costs of lo­cal pro­duc­tions, which will need to com­pete to hire lo­cal crews.</p>
    <p>“The new scheme stuffs cash into the pock­ets of the stu­dios on the false premise that help­ing the for­eign pro­duc­tions is of ben­e­fit to the lo­cal sec­tor. It isn’t,” he wrote on the Me­di­aweek web­site.</p>
    <p>“Un­like ev­ery other in­dus­try, the gov­ern­ment is sub­si­dis­ing for­eign pro­duc­ers while lo­cal pro­duc­tions re­ceive far less, in­deed in most cases, no gov­ern­ment support,” he added.</p>
    <p>In re­cent decades, Aus­tralia’s film in­dus­try has been ex­pand­ing, with the num­ber of Aus­tralian films made each year – in­clud­ing co-pro­duc­tions – in­creas­ing to about 38 a year, up from 14 in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic forced more than 30 film projects to halt or sus­pend pro­duc­tion. The lo­cal in­dus­try has re­sumed pro­duc­tions, but has in­tro­duced strict health safety guide­lines, such as film­ing out­doors and stag­ger­ing start and fin­ish times where pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Some for­eign actors have ar­rived in re­cent weeks for pro­duc­tions but have had to spend the manda­tory 14 days in quar­an­tine before start­ing film­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Jane Sey­mour, who re­cently ar­rived in Aus­tralia to film a movie and com­pleted quar­an­tine in a ho­tel in Sydney, said she was for­tu­nate be­cause “no­body is able to make any­thing right now and Cal­i­for­nia has got worse since I came here”.</p>
