    <p>Al­most 10 years after it was con­ceived at the Asean Sum­mit in Bali in 2011, the world’s largest trade pact – the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) – is set to be signed to­day.</p>
    <p>In­volv­ing the 10 Asean mem­bers, plus China, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and New Zealand, the RCEP cov­ers nearly one-third of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, and con­trib­utes around 30 per cent of its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP).</p>
    <p>It will elim­i­nate as much as 90 per cent of the tar­iffs on im­ports be­tween its par­ties within 20 years of com­ing into ef­fect, and will im­prove mar­ket ac­cess for goods and ser­vices within the re­gion.</p>
    <p>It also aims to es­tab­lish a com­mon set of trade rules and cov­ers non-tra­di­tional ar­eas which are not in some ex­ist­ing agree­ments, such as e-com­merce, com­pe­ti­tion pol­icy and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Here are five key things to note about the mega trade deal:</p>
    <p>1 THE COVID-19 FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>While on­line talks have made le­gal scrub­bing – a process in which lawyers, trans­la­tors and staff re­view and edit the text of the agree­ment – more cum­ber­some, the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pandemic was a mo­ti­vat­ing fac­tor to fi­nalise the deal, given the ben­e­fits of its cuts to tar­iffs and trade bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>A joint state­ment by min­is­ters, re­leased after on­line talks in Au­gust, said the sign­ing of the RCEP agree­ment would en­hance business con­fi­dence, as well as demon­strate the re­gion’s sup­port for an open, in­clu­sive and rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“The min­is­ters also un­der­scored the sig­nif­i­cant role that the RCEP Agree­ment could play in post-pandemic re­cov­ery ef­forts, as well as in con­tribut­ing to the growth and sta­bil­ity of the re­gional and global econ­omy,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Out­go­ing United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s tar­iff-rais­ing trade war with</p>
    <p>China has also given ex­tra im­pe­tus in re­cent years to push ahead with the RCEP, which had other­wise pro­gressed only slug­gishly since ne­go­ti­a­tions be­gan in 2012.</p>
    <p>2 WHO BEN­E­FITS?</p>
    <p>All par­ties to the RCEP stand to gain.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional stud­ies at Ren­min Univer­sity of China Ja­son Ji said Cam­bo­dia, Thai­land and Viet­nam could see an in­crease in GDP and ex­port vol­umes un­der the pact.</p>
    <p>Key sec­tors he sees ben­e­fit­ing in­clude Thai­land’s con­struc­tion sec­tor, Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia’s pro­cessed food in­dus­tries, and Laos’ man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences (SUSS) se­nior lec­turer Pan Zhengqi said a sig­nif­i­cant re­sult of the RCEP is that it helps to fa­cil­i­tate com­plex sup­ply chains, which would also boost South Korea’s elec­tron­ics sec­tor.</p>
    <p>As for Viet­nam, he said, the lower trade bar­ri­ers and en­hanced mar­ket ac­cess would ben­e­fit its telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, tex­tile and footwear sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Dr Pan added that China, be­ing the world’s largest trad­ing na­tion, stands to gain the most from the pact.</p>
    <p>Both its man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vice sec­tors would see a boost given the coun­try’s large ex­port and im­port ca­pac­i­ties, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that ex­changes of</p>
    <p>tech­ni­cal know-how un­der the agree­ment would also help China move up the value chain.</p>
    <p>3 IN­DIA’S WITH­DRAWAL</p>
    <p>There will be 15 in­stead of 16 par­tic­i­pants after In­dia an­nounced in November last year that it would pull out of the talks.</p>
    <p>It had ma­jor con­cerns over trade im­bal­ances, as it had trade deficits with 11 of the 15 na­tions in­volved in the RCEP.</p>
    <p>Fear­ing that the deal could re­sult in a flood of man­u­fac­tur­ing and agri­cul­tural prod­ucts into its mar­ket, In­dia was un­will­ing to re­move tar­iffs on many sen­si­tive in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>The door re­mains open for In­dia to re­join, a point sev­eral Asean lead­ers made at their sum­mit with Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor of prac­tice at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy James Crab­tree said</p>
    <p>In­dia’s de­ci­sion not to come on board was a set­back for the agree­ment but a “his­toric blun­der” for In­dia it­self.</p>
    <p>“It might well have made the agree­ment eas­ier to fi­nalise, but it also left it dom­i­nated by China, to the dis­ap­point­ment of South-east Asia in par­tic­u­lar,” he said.</p>
    <p>“For In­dia, it sig­nalled a more fun­da­men­tal turn away from eco­nomic open­ness, leav­ing New Delhi out­side both of the eco­nomic blocs that will de­fine Asia’s fu­ture: RCEP and the 11-mem­ber Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP).”</p>
    <p>Ren­min Univer­sity’s Prof Ji said In­dia’s with­drawal is not ir­re­versible, nor will its ab­sence sig­nif­i­cantly im­pact the scope and qual­ity of the agree­ment, as the bulk of the ne­go­ti­a­tions was al­ready con­cluded with In­dia’s par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>“That said, RCEP be­comes a smaller mega-FTA be­cause of In­dia’s ab­sence, tem­po­rary or other­wise.”</p>
    <p>4 WHERE DOES THE CPTPP FIT IN?</p>
    <p>The Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, which orig­i­nally in­cluded the US, was seen as a coun­ter­weight to RCEP, and RCEP’s in­clu­sion of In­dia was meant to bal­ance China. But nei­ther sce­nario has panned out in the way it was en­vi­sioned.</p>
    <p>The CPTPP, which evolved from the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship after Mr Don­ald Trump pulled out of the deal in one of his first acts as Pres­i­dent, was con­cluded in 2018 among 11 coun­tries, seven of which are also in the RCEP: Aus­tralia, Brunei, Ja­pan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Sin­ga­pore and Viet­nam. The other CPTPP mem­bers are Canada, Chile, Mex­ico and Peru.</p>
    <p>The CPTPP in­volves greater elim­i­na­tion of tar­iffs and also in­cludes pro­vi­sions on labour and en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards, un­like the RCEP.</p>
    <p>But few are hold­ing their breath that the US, which is still emerg­ing from the throes of a bit­terly con­tested elec­tion, will re­turn to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble any time soon.</p>
    <p>“The RCEP pro­vides China with much-needed re­prieve from the US-China trade war and ris­ing global pro­tec­tion­ism,” says SUSS’ Dr Pan.</p>
    <p>How­ever, both the CPTPP and RCEP are seen as build­ing blocks of a much-larger free trade vi­sion span­ning the Pa­cific Ocean: The Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pa­cific, which mem­bers of the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) have al­luded to as early as in 2004.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is host­ing this year’s Apec lead­ers’ sum­mit later this week.</p>
    <p>5 WILL AUS­TRALIA-CHINA TEN­SIONS AF­FECT DEAL?</p>
    <p>After Aus­tralia in­curred the wrath of its largest trad­ing part­ner China in April by lead­ing calls for a probe into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment or­dered a halt to im­ports of Aus­tralian prod­ucts such as coal, bar­ley and wine.</p>
    <p>Some say the on­go­ing trade spat could stymie co­op­er­a­tion un­der the RCEP.</p>
    <p>But SUSS’ Dr Pan said the trade pact can be use­ful in de-es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions be­tween Aus­tralia and China in one ma­jor way: It con­strains the ac­tions of both coun­tries within a rules-based frame­work. “As such, par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries – even ma­jor pow­ers such as China – might not read­ily use trade as a strate­gic lever­age,” he said, point­ing out that China’s be­hav­iour within RCEP will shape its rep­u­ta­tion and cred­i­bil­ity, as well as al­ter the be­hav­iour of other states to­wards it.</p>
    <p>By sup­port­ing fre­quent di­a­logues among mem­bers, the trade pact will also de­crease in­for­ma­tion asym­me­tries and fos­ter co­op­er­a­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Not­with­stand­ing these is­sues, an­a­lysts agree that the key now is to demon­strate that the RCEP is use­ful to its par­ties.</p>
    <p>“RCEP will not su­per­sede pre-ex­ist­ing FTAs (free trade agree­ments) like Asean-Plus agree­ments per se,” said Ren­min Univer­sity’s Prof Ji, re­fer­ring to agree­ments which Asean has signed separately with ma­jor economies such as China, Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>“But it im­proves upon them and fa­cil­i­tates an or­derly and ne­go­ti­ated con­ver­gence of these agree­ments in terms of trad­ing rules and cus­toms pro­ce­dures.”</p>
