    <p>BUDAPEST • Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has taken a swipe at ri­vals Ferrari, de­scrib­ing re­cent com­ments by Scud­e­ria chief Mat­tia Binotto about For­mula One’s engine reg­u­la­tions as “an­other com­plete b***s*** story”.</p>
    <p>The Aus­trian re­jected the Ital­ian’s claim that other teams – and not just Ferrari – were af­fected by tech­ni­cal di­rec­tives last year, which the Pranc­ing Horse blamed for their slump in form.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing late on Satur­day, Wolff was clearly ir­ri­tated by Ferrari’s claims. “There was a clear reg­u­la­tion on power units that was clar­i­fied in Austin on what we are al­lowed to do and not, which was im­por­tant,” he said, re­fer­ring to last year’s United States Grand Prix, where Ferrari’s hot streak ended.</p>
    <p>“But noth­ing that was in any way sur­pris­ing be­cause if you com­ply with the reg­u­la­tions, then that was clear any­way.”</p>
    <p>Ferrari had reeled off six con­sec­u­tive pole po­si­tions and three suc­ces­sive wins be­fore the Austin race last Novem­ber, a streak that raised sus­pi­cion among ri­val teams that their en­gines were en­hanced in a way that con­tra­vened some tech­ni­cal reg­u­la­tions. That di­rec­tive was fol­lowed two weeks later by an­other in Sao Paulo that fo­cused on other tech­ni­cal as­pects of power units.</p>
    <p>The re­sult was that Ferrari suf­fered an im­me­di­ate drop in power out­put and speed, hand­ing the ini­tia­tive in the cham­pi­onship to six­time cham­pi­ons Mercedes.</p>
    <p>Wolff also hit out at Ferrari and oth­ers for say­ing they were ready to sign a new com­mer­cial “Con­corde Agree­ment”, set­ting out the sport’s fu­ture to 2026. He said: “They make them­selves a laugh­ing stock with those com­ments in the pub­lic. Ne­go­ti­a­tions should be tak­ing place be­hind closed doors with­out a run­ning commentary from com­peti­tors.”</p>
