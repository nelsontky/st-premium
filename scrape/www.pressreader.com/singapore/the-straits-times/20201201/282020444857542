    <p>The 170 mem­bers of The Pines club who are su­ing mo­tor­ing ty­coon Peter Kwee and his com­pany Exk­lu­siv Re­sorts for re­lo­cat­ing and down­siz­ing the club, have ac­cused him of sub­mit­ting an in­com­plete ac­count of a di­a­logue held in 2012.</p>
    <p>At the ses­sion, they said he gave them the im­pres­sion the club would re­main at its 30 Stevens Road ad­dress. But some of The Pines’ ameni­ties were later re­lo­cated to a shared site in Tanah Merah.</p>
    <p>Their ac­cu­sa­tion was made yes­ter­day when Mr Kwee took the stand for the first time in the on­go­ing High Court case, in which the club mem­bers are seek­ing dam­ages of more than $110,000 each.</p>
    <p>Exk­lu­siv Re­sorts is the club’s pro­pri­etor and Mr Kwee is Exk­lu­siv’s di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>The plain­tiffs’ lawyer, Mr Lau Kah Hee from B.C. Lim & Lau, re­ferred to the slides Mr Kwee sub­mit­ted and claimed to have pre­sented at the meet­ing. “If you look through all th­ese slides, there’s noth­ing about a re­lo­ca­tion of the club or club­house... In fact they show (it at) 30 Stevens Road,” said Mr Lau.</p>
    <p>He also said his clients told him the slides were not those they were shown at the di­a­logue and the min­utes of the di­a­logue Mr Kwee sub­mit­ted as part of doc­u­ments for the trial were “not com­plete”.</p>
    <p>The slides and min­utes were not sent to mem­bers af­ter the di­a­logue, Mr Lau added.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwee said that to his knowl­edge, those were the slides shown at the meet­ing, and the plans at the time were in the pre­lim­i­nary stage. “We had no in­ten­tion, at that point in time, to re­lo­cate the club.”</p>
    <p>The mem­bers are also ac­cus­ing him of breach­ing con­trac­tual agree­ments and fail­ing to tell them about the pro­posed re­de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The club was closed for ren­o­va­tion in 2013, and the Stevens Road premises were sold to prop­erty de­vel­oper Ox­ley Gem. Mem­bers ac­cuse Mr Kwee of not in­form­ing them about the sale.</p>
    <p>He said the sale was “pub­lic knowl­edge” as it had been re­ported in the me­dia. Hence, he did not write to in­form mem­bers, he added.</p>
    <p>High Court judge Chua Lee Ming asked him if it was his prac­tice not to di­rectly in­form club mem­bers but in­stead rely on them to read the news­pa­pers. Mr Kwee ad­mit­ted it was an “over­sight”.</p>
    <p>On the club’s re­lo­ca­tion, Mr Lau ques­tioned Mr Kwee why he did not in­form mem­bers about the “in­evitable re­lo­ca­tion of the club­house” when it be­came clear in 2015 that it had to be moved. Mr Kwee said he “tried to find a se­cond so­lu­tion” and did not think of telling mem­bers then.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers have been al­lowed to use the fa­cil­i­ties at the La­guna Na­tional Golf and Coun­try Club and the Dusit Thani La­guna Sin­ga­pore re­sort in Tanah Merah.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwee’s lawyers, Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Foo Xian Fong, noted ear­lier in court doc­u­ments that The Pines had se­cured the lease of a smaller club­house in Stevens Road that is set to open early next year.</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues to­day.</p>
