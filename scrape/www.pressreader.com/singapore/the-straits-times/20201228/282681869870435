    <p>With tech­nol­ogy and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tak­ing over so much of what we do to­day, it’s hard to say what jobs will be avail­able for to­day’s kids when they’re ready for the work­force – those jobs prob­a­bly don’t even ex­ist yet.</p>
    <p>What does JJ, my three-year-old daugh­ter, want to be when she grows up?</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on what time of the day this ques­tion is posed, her re­sponse might vary.</p>
    <p>If she has just come home from school, she will want to be a teacher, “just like Ms Ka­t­rina” from her nurs­ery class.</p>
    <p>Or if my wife and I have just taken our helper to the clinic for her rou­tine med­i­cal check-up, JJ would then as­pire to be a doc­tor, “to help peo­ple feel bet­ter when they have a boo-boo”.</p>
    <p>And af­ter a leisurely evening walk with our fam­ily dog Vito, she will de­clare earnestly that when she grows up, she re­ally wants to be him.</p>
    <p>Of course, be­ing the en­cour­ag­ing father that I am, I du­ti­fully tell my dar­ling daugh­ter that when she grows up, she can be what­ever her heart de­sires – yes, even Vito.</p>
    <p>And, what­ever oc­cu­pa­tion she chooses in the fu­ture, Daddy will al­ways be very, very proud.</p>
    <p>But, for now, can she just please sit still for the next 10 min­utes to chew the din­ner that’s been stew­ing in her mouth for the last</p>
    <p>15, so that I don’t have to chase her around the room while she bran­dishes a blunt fork, screech­ing: “I am Vito! Pee pee pee! Kick kick kick!”</p>
    <p>(When Daddy grows up, he just wants to be in bed for a long, long time.)</p>
    <p>Much has been proph­e­sied about the em­ploy­ment land­scape that our chil­dren will con­tend with when they grow up.</p>
    <p>With tech­nol­ogy and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tak­ing over so much of what we do to­day, it’s hard to say what jobs will be avail­able for to­day’s kids when they’re ready for the work­force – those jobs prob­a­bly don’t even ex­ist yet.</p>
    <p>And this phe­nom­e­non isn’t new ei­ther. Twenty years ago, if we were to ask our three-year-olds what they’d like to be when they grew up, nei­ther par­ent nor child would have thought that drone pi­lot would be an avail­able op­tion. Or mo­bile app de­vel­oper.</p>
    <p>Or even In­sta­gram in­flu­encer.</p>
    <p>I mean, who would have imag­ined then that peo­ple would one day get paid to play with – I mean, op­er­ate – a re­mote-con­trol hov­er­craft?</p>
    <p>And who would have thought that we would one day need a global army of pro­gram­mers, tasked to cre­ate soft­ware for our mo­bile phones, so we can per­form the es­sen­tial tasks of our mod­ern lives: buy­ing gro­ceries, trad­ing on the stock mar­ket and dig­i­tally cor­rect­ing our fat faces in pho­to­graphs?</p>
    <p>And I’m sure no one saw this com­ing 20 years ago: That in the not-too-dis­tant fu­ture, putting up tiny square pho­to­graphs of your at­trac­tive self on the In­ter­net would count as a form of gain­ful em­ploy­ment. But only if said pho­to­graphs de­pict the sub­ject in var­i­ous states of hap­pi­ness, pen­sive­ness or un­dress.</p>
    <p>My daugh­ter doesn’t yet un­der­stand the con­cept of KOLs (key opin­ion lead­ers), LOLs, In­sta­gram grids or string biki­nis. I in­tend to keep it that way un­til she’s a bit older and can more suit­ably ex­er­cise self-con­trol when it comes to screen time – prob­a­bly when she’s 36 or there­abouts.</p>
    <p>I rue the day when lit­tle JJ re­alises that so­cial me­dia in­flu­encer is an ac­tual oc­cu­pa­tion – a po­ten­tially well-pay­ing one, at that – and de­cides she no longer wants to be Vito when she grows up.</p>
    <p>And, be­cause I work in the me­dia in­dus­try, I can per­fectly un­der­stand the al­lure of such per­son­al­ity mar­ket­ing, which is es­sen­tially what so­cial me­dia in­flu­encers are all about.</p>
    <p>Any­one who com­mands an au­di­ence can be­come a plat­form to at­tract ad­ver­tis­ing dol­lars – it re­ally isn’t rocket science.</p>
    <p>The real strug­gle is, as a par­ent, hav­ing to ex­plain what th­ese in­flu­encers have to do to com­mand this au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if I had to ex­plain how some­one be­comes a doc­tor, I might be in­clined to say it in­volves “many years of study­ing re­ally hard”. Or, if I had to ex­plain how some­one be­comes a teacher, I would prob­a­bly in­voke words such as “a strong de­sire to nur­ture”.</p>
    <p>But, when ex­plain­ing the qual­i­ties that make some­one a ster­ling in­flu­encer, I fear I would more likely be con­jur­ing up words such as “skinny”, “pretty” and “very hot” (hence the propen­sity for fre­quently don­ning string biki­nis).</p>
    <p>And young, im­pres­sion­able JJ, even with her lim­ited vo­cab­u­lary, might think her­self per­fect for this job, since she is al­ways com­plain­ing about be­ing “very hot” and ex­hort­ing us to “go to an air-con place” for lunch.</p>
    <p>All this con­ster­na­tion might be a lit­tle bit pre­ma­ture for a father of a three-year-old. But I can’t be the only par­ent think­ing about this. There must be many of us out there, ask­ing them­selves what to do when their young child dis­cov­ers the world of gain­fully em­ployed In­sta­gram in­flu­encers.</p>
    <p>How will we, as good, re­spon­si­ble par­ents, ex­plain a world where peo­ple are al­ways beau­ti­ful/happy/mak­ing heart sym­bols with their hands?</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, where do the par­ents sign up?</p>
