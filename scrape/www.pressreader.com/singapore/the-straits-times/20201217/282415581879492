    <p>BARCELONA • With his con­tract ex­pir­ing next sum­mer, Barcelona cap­tain Lionel Messi will be free to talk to clubs from next month.</p>
    <p>As such, the loom­ing pos­si­bil­ity of their great­est player leav­ing on a free trans­fer is dom­i­nat­ing the agenda ahead of their club elec­tions, now set for Jan 24.</p>
    <p>The can­di­dates vy­ing to be­come the Cata­lan gi­ants’ new pres­i­dent ap­pear to want to keep Messi.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they are un­sure if they can come to terms on a new deal, es­pe­cially if the club can only of­fer a re­duced con­tract from his cur­rent weekly wage of €565,000 (S$916,000).</p>
    <p>Pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Emili Rousaud be­lieves Messi’s salary is too much for Barca, given their coro­n­avirus-in­duced fi­nan­cial woes, so he hopes the Ar­gentina skip­per can ac­cept a lower pay as long as they are com­pet­ing for the high­est honours.</p>
    <p>“In the club’s cur­rent sit­u­a­tion Messi’s salary is not sus­tain­able, so we’ll have to reach an agree­ment with him. We will present an at­trac­tive project to him,” Rousaud told Span­ish news­pa­per AS on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“What mat­ters most here is the sporting project. When Messi said he was leav­ing (in Au­gust), he didn’t men­tion money.</p>
    <p>“He has the high­est salary in the world, no one earns more than him, he doesn’t want to leave be­cause he earns too lit­tle. He wants to leave be­cause he wants to win tro­phies.”</p>
    <p>But an­other pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Jordi Farre feels Messi should be kept at all costs, and bring­ing back Ney­mar should also be at the top of the pri­or­ity list to keep their star for­ward happy.</p>
    <p>“Keep­ing hold of Messi is cru­cial... I hope that on Jan 25, af­ter win­ning the elec­tion, the first thing I will do is sign his new con­tract,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I will not re­veal any pri­vate con­ver­sa­tions but we’re work­ing on it. All Leo wants in the end is to stay at Barca, and I’m sure there will be no prob­lem. I do not be­lieve that we will have to part with our best play­ers. If we have the best play­ers, we win ti­tles and we bring in more rev­enue.”</p>
    <p>While ad­mit­ting Barca’s fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion was “bad”, he is still hope­ful things will get bet­ter, sug­gest­ing a mega-money move for Paris Saint-Ger­main for­ward and for­mer Barca star Ney­mar would be “the world’s best in­vest­ment”.</p>
    <p>“He would cost Barca very lit­tle, be­cause he helps sell rights, replica shirts, ad­ver­tis­ing and spon­sor­ship.”</p>
