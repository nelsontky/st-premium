    <p>He is known for his phys­i­cal and tech­ni­cal prow­ess on the pitch and his Bol­ly­wood-in­spired so­cial me­dia videos off it. Soon, Sin­ga­pore for­ward Iqbal Hus­sain could well be show­cas­ing one of his trade­mark dance cel­e­bra­tions in In­dia.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the 27-year-old made the big­gest move of his foot­ball ca­reer when he inked a short­term deal with Chennai City to be­come the first Sin­ga­pore-born player to sign for an In­dian club. Ac­cord­ing to the Asian Foot­ball Con­fed­er­a­tion (AFC), In­dia is ranked 15th in terms of club com­pe­ti­tions, four rungs ahead of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional for­ward flew to Chennai on Fri­day, and is set to be­come only the third Sin­ga­porean to rep­re­sent an In­dian club af­ter Eng­land-born John Wilkinson played for Sal­gao­car in 2013 and Nige­ria-born Pre­cious Emue­jer­aye played for Churchill Brothers in 2017.</p>
    <p>Other Sin­ga­pore­ans cur­rently con­tracted to over­seas clubs in­clude Jo­hor Darul Takzim’s Hariss Harun (Malaysia); Jerv’s Ikhsan Fandi (Nor­way); Sa­mut Prakan City’s Izwan Mah­bud, Suphan­buri’s Zul­fahmi Arifin, and BG Pathum’s Ir­fan Fandi (all Thai­land).</p>
    <p>Iqbal did not hes­i­tate to re­unite with coach Satyasagar­a (for­merly known as K. Balagu­maran), hav­ing worked to­gether at Gom­bak United i n 2012 and Hougang United in 2016.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally makes a dif­fer­ence when you have a coach who be­lieves in your abil­ity,” he said. “I have al­ways wanted to play over­seas but ob­sta­cles al­ways came up at the last minute.</p>
    <p>“I just want to step out of my com­fort zone, prove my worth at a higher l evel and con­trib­ute to Chennai City.</p>
    <p>“It is amaz­ing I will be do­ing so in a coun­try where my great-grand­par­ents were from.”</p>
    <p>In the re­cently con­cluded Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) sea­son, he played 13 games, start­ing four times due to the rul­ing that se­nior lo­cal clubs have to start three Un­der-23 play­ers. He scored twice to help the Ea­gles qual­ify for the AFC Cup by fin­ish­ing as the thirdbest lo­cal team, and fourth over­all.</p>
    <p>He said: “I want to thank Gey­lang for tak­ing me in when my move to (Thai League 1 club) Sukhothai col­lapsed at the last minute. I was down and thought about hang­ing up my boots when coach Noor Ali gave me a chance.”</p>
    <p>The 1.86m at­tacker could make his I-League de­but on Jan 9, when Chennai City take on Goku­lam Ker­ala in their opener at the Kalyani Mu­nic­i­pal Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>He hopes to con­vince his new em­ploy­ers to ex­tend his con­tract be­yond the end of the sea­son in April. The club plan to play in the richer In­dian Su­per League (ISL), which of­fers the cham­pi­ons an AFC Cham­pi­ons League spot.</p>
    <p>Na­tional team man­ager Eric Ong said: “It is good for him to have a change in en­vi­ron­ment at this stage of his ca­reer. We al­ways knew Iqbal has the tal­ent, and now he has a new stage to show what he is ca­pa­ble of.”</p>
    <p>Due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the I-League sea­son will be played only in Kolkata and Kalyani, where 11 teams face off. The top six will qual­ify for the cham­pi­onship stage while the bot­tom five will move on to the rel­e­ga­tion stage.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Iqbal, an­other Sin­ga­porean look­ing for­ward to a fresh start at Chennai is his 56-year-old coach, who took over the reins af­ter Ak­bar Nawas left the club by mu­tual con­sent in Oc­to­ber. Last year, the duo had led Chennai to their first I-League crown.</p>
    <p>Satyasagar­a, whose last head coach stint was with the Sin­ga­pore na­tional women’s team in 2017, said: “I be­lieve (Iqbal) can have a good sea­son with us and go on to be­come the first Sin­ga­porean to play in the ISL.</p>
    <p>“As for me, I have learnt a lot and en­joyed suc­cess while be­ing as­sis­tant to V. Sun­dram Moor­thy (with Lion­sXII in 2013) and Ak­bar, and this new role is a new chal­lenge.”</p>
    <p>NO MORE HUR­DLES</p>
    <p>I have al­ways wanted to play over­seas but ob­sta­cles al­ways came up at the last minute. I just want to step out of my com­fort zone, prove my worth at a higher level and con­trib­ute to Chennai City. IQBAL HUS­SAIN, na­tional player, who flew to In­dia on Fri­day to join Chennai City.</p>
