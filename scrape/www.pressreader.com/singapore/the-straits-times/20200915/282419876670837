    <p>When Amer­i­can com­poser, ac­tor Lin-Manuel Mi­randa ap­pears on screen and sings the lines: “Alexan­der Hamil­ton, my name is Alexan­der Hamil­ton”, I bris­tle with ex­cite­ment.</p>
    <p>I’m watch­ing the award-win­ning mu­si­cal Hamil­ton, which took Broad­way by storm when it opened in 2015. It was filmed on stage and meant to be re­leased on the big screen next year. In­stead, it was re­leased in July this year on subscripti­on ser­vice Dis­ney+ amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The weekend it was re­leased, the Dis­ney+ app was down­loaded 752,451 times glob­ally, a 46.6 per cent jump from the av­er­age num­ber of down­loads over the four week­ends prior, ac­cord­ing to an­a­lyt­ics firm App­topia.</p>
    <p>Ob­vi­ously, many oth­ers around the world were as ex­cited as I was about watch­ing Hamil­ton at home.</p>
    <p>Any reser­va­tions I had about the show not liv­ing up to the live ver­sion – which I had watched on Broad­way – were oblit­er­ated as the show pro­gressed.</p>
    <p>I was once again pulled into the story of an im­mi­grant mak­ing his way in Amer­ica and be­com­ing one of the coun­try’s found­ing fa­thers – laugh­ing and cry­ing along­side the filmed au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>It was a meld­ing of the­atri­cal form and filmic medium, but at the end, it still felt like I had just stepped out of the the­atre – emo­tion­ally charged, brim­ming with en­ergy, and some­what trans­formed.</p>
    <p>Sim­ply put, it had suc­ceeded in go­ing from stage to screen.</p>
    <p>There are only two other pre-recorded pro­duc­tions that I have watched this sea­son with sim­i­lar af­fect: A Street­car Named De­sire, a co-pro­duc­tion by Lon­don arts venue the Young Vic and pro­ducer Joshua An­drews, and Emily Of Emer­ald Hill by Sin­ga­pore the­atre com­pany Wild Rice.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic con­tin­ues, many the­atre prac­ti­tion­ers, my­self in­cluded, are still try­ing to make the­atre hap­pen in some form or other: putting up pre-recorded pro­duc­tions, turn­ing shows into au­dio ex­pe­ri­ences or em­brac­ing online plat­forms such as Zoom.</p>
    <p>Some have suc­ceeded, oth­ers not, but many are push­ing bound­aries way be­yond a fourth wall, which makes for an ex­cit­ing, amor­phous phase in the­atre as it ne­go­ti­ates its re­la­tion­ship with an au­di­ence on screen.</p>
    <p>As a jour­nal­ist, I have seen the me­dia in­dus­try swing from an em­pha­sis on print to dig­i­tal, but</p>
    <p>I never thought that as a the­atre prac­ti­tioner, I would have to pivot in the same way and cre­ate some­thing for an online au­di­ence – that was the job of film di­rec­tors and YouTu­bers.</p>
    <p>I run the­atre com­pany How Drama to­gether with my co-artis­tic di­rec­tor Ross Nasir and this year, when we re­alised our an­nual pro­duc­tion Fat Kids Are Harder To Kid­nap could not be staged ac­cord­ing to plan, we started look­ing for al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>The show has been around for 12 years. We per­form 31 plays in an hour, and the au­di­ence de­cides the or­der of the plays by shout­ing out the num­ber of the play they wish to watch.</p>
    <p>The plays riff off current af­fairs, and with so much hap­pen­ing in the world, it felt like a real waste to let the year slip by with­out a show.</p>
    <p>Be­cause it is an in­ter­ac­tive per­for­mance, we had the ex­tra chal­lenge of trans­lat­ing that el­e­ment of au­di­ence par­tic­i­pa­tion to the online ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>We toyed with the idea of Face­book live and in­ter­act­ing with the au­di­ence through its cha­t­room. But the in­ter­ac­tiv­ity wasn’t as vis­ceral.</p>
    <p>Then, a friend told me about her daugh­ter’s bal­let classes on Zoom and how the teacher was able to high­light the in­di­vid­ual stu­dents at home us­ing the “spot­light” func­tion. Per­haps we could use that func­tion to spot­light the ac­tors at home as they per­formed live and the au­di­ence could still shout out num­bers while in the Zoom meet­ing?</p>
    <p>At that point, I didn’t even have a Zoom ac­count, but I told Ross about it and we set to work get­ting fund­ing, as­sem­bling the team and ask­ing for ad­vice from friends who had pro­duced live online events.</p>
    <p>The dis­tinc­tion be­tween the­atre and film be­gan to blur, as we waded into dig­i­tal ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Re­hearsals took place en­tirely online dur­ing the shut­down, we bought props and lights from domestic sell­ers on e-com­merce sites and couri­ered wine to the ac­tors’ fam­i­lies to thank them for sac­ri­fic­ing their kitchens, bath­rooms and liv­ing rooms for the show.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore en­tered phase one of the cir­cuit breaker, we pre­miered Sin­ga­pore’s first live, in­ter­ac­tive the­atre pro­duc­tion – Fat Kids Are Harder To Kid­nap on Zoom.</p>
    <p>As artists, we felt the rush of the­atre again each night as we pre­set our props, ran lines and did sound and mic checks in prepa­ra­tion for our live show</p>
    <p>(none of it is pre-recorded).</p>
    <p>We were as vul­ner­a­ble to an au­di­ence’s cheers and jeers as ever be­fore. We were also at the mercy of our home In­ter­net con­nec­tions and a fickle Zoom plat­form.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally sup­posed to be a one-night-only per­for­mance, the sold-out show ran for six nights. And nearly ev­ery night, there were mo­ments of panic trig­gered by lag­ging con­nec­tions, ac­tors los­ing au­dio or screens go­ing black for no ap­par­ent rea­son. An up­dated ver­sion of the show will be part of the Mel­bourne Fringe in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, too, have been in­no­vat­ing in this space, Mur­der At Mandai Camp by Sight Lines</p>
    <p>En­ter­tain­ment used Tele­gram to com­mu­ni­cate with the au­di­ence, while di­rec­tor and Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Alvin Tan and New-York based Sim Yan Ying co-directed a project called</p>
    <p>Who’s There?, which in­volved an in­ter­na­tional cast from Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>As con­di­tions im­prove, the­atre prac­ti­tion­ers con­tinue to in­no­vate online. But things are com­ing full cir­cle as com­pa­nies ap­ply their creativity to de­vel­op­ing phys­i­cal shows on stage, which ad­here to rules that keep au­di­ences and artists safe.</p>
    <p>Last week, The New York Times’ pod­cast The Daily fea­tured a re­gional the­atre in New Eng­land which is putting up a so­cially dis­tanced ver­sion of the mu­si­cal God­spell. The ac­tors stay phys­i­cally apart, put on and re­move masks, and oc­ca­sion­ally stand be­hind screens for their scenes.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the re­port, this is the only mu­si­cal with union ac­tors tak­ing place in the United States this sum­mer. The show runs till Sun­day and checks online show that tick­ets are all sold out.</p>
    <p>As laws and guide­lines about com­mu­nity gath­er­ings change, the in­ter­na­tional the­atre com­mu­nity has to con­stantly adapt and in­no­vate. And who knows what the­atre may evolve into or what form it might ul­ti­mately take.</p>
    <p>The lights may have dimmed on the­atre for now, but to bor­row a line from Hamil­ton – there’s a mil­lion things artists haven’t done, just you wait.</p>
