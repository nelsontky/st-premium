    <p>On Dec 21, the night of the win­ter sol­stice, the two largest plan­ets in the so­lar sys­tem will ap­pear to merge in the night sky.</p>
    <p>It will be the clos­est vis­i­ble con­junc­tion of Jupiter and Saturn in 800 years.</p>
    <p>For the past few months, the two gas giants have been “woo­ing” each other, inch­ing closer and closer in the west­ern part of the night sky.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the ringed planet is lo­cated above and slightly to the right of Jupiter, about 1 de­gree away.</p>
    <p>On a clear night, the plan­ets are seen as white dots in the sky, with Jupiter be­ing closer to Earth and there­fore ap­pear­ing brighter.</p>
    <p>As both plan­ets con­tinue trac­ing their or­bits over the next week, they will align closer to each other.</p>
    <p>Jupiter has been inch­ing to­wards Saturn while Saturn has been mov­ing east­wards with re­spect to back­ground stars.</p>
    <p>Next Mon­day night, the giants will get locked in an em­brace and cre­ate a “dou­ble planet” ef­fect, ap­pear­ing as a bril­liant white orb in the sky.</p>
    <p>As­tronomers have dubbed this ro­man­tic spec­ta­cle “The Great Con­junc­tion”.</p>
    <p>The plan­ets have not come this close in cen­turies. They will be only 0.1 de­gree apart – which is about the thick­ness of a dime (a US 10-cent coin) held at arm’s length, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (Nasa).</p>
    <p>A Cen­tre for As­tro­physics, Har­vard & Smith­so­nian spokesman told The New York Times that the align­ment will re­sem­ble a tippe­dover snow­man in the sky.</p>
    <p>Un­like with eclipses, ev­ery­one on Earth will be able to wit­ness this plan­e­tary marvel.</p>
    <p>WHY IS THE GREAT CON­JUNC­TION SO RARE?</p>
    <p>A con­junc­tion in the cos­mos hap­pens when two or more ce­les­tial bod­ies cross paths.</p>
    <p>Jupiter or­bits the sun ev­ery 12 years while Saturn takes 29 years. This means that they play catch-up with each other ev­ery 20 years.</p>
    <p>Although a con­junc­tion be­tween them hap­pens ev­ery 20 years, this year’s con­junc­tion is spe­cial be­cause of how close to each other they will ap­pear.</p>
    <p>Dr Abel Yang from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s physics depart­ment says: “Their or­bits are slightly tilted with re­spect to each other so there is a slight dif­fer­ence in their paths. When they usu­ally align, they are not so close to each other be­cause of this dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“What makes this year’s event rare is that the con­junc­tion hap­pens very close to when their paths ap­pear to cross.”</p>
    <p>The last time the plan­ets aligned this close was in 1623 but the con­junc­tion was not vis­i­ble due to the sun’s glare. This means that the last peo­ple to wit­ness the phe­nom­e­non were our an­ces­tors in 1226, almost 800 years ago.</p>
    <p>The next Jupiter-Saturn con­junc­tion of this scale will be in 2080.</p>
    <p>“Rare ce­les­tial events such as these re­mind us about just how beau­ti­ful cos­mol­ogy and math­e­mat­ics can be as we deepen our un­der­stand­ing of how the plan­ets or­bit and align,” said a spokesman for the Sci­ence Cen­tre Ob­ser­va­tory team.</p>
    <p>HOW CAN WE SEE IT?</p>
    <p>The Christmas Star – an­other name for the rare phe­nom­e­non – can be seen with the naked eye but binoc­u­lars and tele­scopes can en­hance the view­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The con­junc­tion can be seen dur­ing the en­tire time that the plan­ets are vis­i­ble on Dec 21 as well as a few days be­fore and af­ter – but they will not be as close to each other then.</p>
    <p>The plan­ets will be vis­i­ble from 30 min­utes af­ter sun­set un­til around 8.45pm in the west­ern and south-west­ern part of the sky.</p>
    <p>Dr Yang added that the best time to ob­serve the con­junc­tion will be around 8pm.</p>
    <p>A pair of binoc­u­lars may show a clearer gap be­tween the two plan­ets. With a tele­scope, stargaz­ers will be able to see the two plan­ets, their largest moons, and even Saturn’s rings.</p>
    <p>Astron­omy clubs in some ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions will be hold­ing so­cially dis­tanced, small-group stargaz­ing ses­sions for their mem­bers next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>At ITE Col­lege East, 15 stu­dents from the col­lege’s astron­omy club will use pro­fes­sional tele­scopes to wit­ness the con­junc­tion.</p>
    <p>If weather per­mits, the Sci­ence Cen­tre Ob­ser­va­tory – which is closed – will at­tempt to livestream the con­junc­tion on its Face­book page.</p>
    <p>The ob­ser­va­tory team’s spokesman said: “It some­how seems fit­ting that this very rare ce­les­tial event comes as a spe­cial gift this hol­i­day sea­son as the rather un­prece­dented 2020 comes to an end.”</p>
