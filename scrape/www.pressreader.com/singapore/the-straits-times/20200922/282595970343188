    <p>• Few art­works sold in the past few years have drawn as much at­ten­tion as Co­me­dian by Ital­ian artist Mau­r­izio Cat­te­lan, in part be­cause, de­spite its price and ironic hu­mour, it is at its heart a ba­nana that one tapes to a wall.</p>
    <p>The sly work’s sim­plic­ity en­ticed col­lec­tors to pay as much as US$150,000 (S$203,500) for it at a Miami art fair last year, an act of con­nois­seur­ship that de­lighted them but as­ton­ished the many peo­ple who had not imag­ined that a “sculp­ture” of fruit on a wall could com­mand such a price.</p>
    <p>Now, the work’s aes­thetic merit is be­ing re­in­forced by the Guggen­heim Mu­seum in Man­hat­tan, which is ac­cept­ing it into its col­lec­tion as an anony­mous donation.</p>
    <p>“We are grate­ful re­cip­i­ents of the gift of Co­me­dian, a fur­ther demon­stra­tion of the artist’s deft con­nec­tion to the his­tory of mod­ern art,” said the Guggen­heim’s di­rec­tor</p>
    <p>Richard Arm­strong. “Beyond which, it of­fers lit­tle stress to our stor­age.”</p>
    <p>In fact, Co­me­dian, as sold, does not in­clude a ba­nana or tape.</p>
    <p>What one buys is a “cer­tifi­cate of au­then­tic­ity”, a sur­pris­ingly de­tailed, 14-page list of in­struc­tions, with di­a­grams, on how the ba­nana should be in­stalled and dis­played.</p>
    <p>Ms Lena Stringari, the Guggen­heim’s chief con­ser­va­tor, said the in­struc­tions will be quite easy to fol­low in ad­dress­ing questions like how of­ten to change ba­nanas (seven to 10 days) and where to af­fix them (“175cm above ground”).</p>
    <p>The con­ser­va­tion of con­cep­tual art is not al­ways so straightfo­rward for mu­se­ums in­creas­ingly asked to pre­serve works made from all kinds of ephe­meral sub­stances, like food.</p>
    <p>How does one care for a scale model of an Al­ge­rian city made out of cous­cous? A sculp­ture made of in­ter­lock­ing tor­tillas? Fruit stuck on a coa­track? (All works the</p>
    <p>Guggen­heim has shown.)</p>
    <p>Given the ex­pec­ta­tion that mu­se­ums will pre­serve works for gen­er­a­tions, cen­turies, maybe even for­ever, the host of tricky questions that sur­faces around this sort of work goes beyond the more typ­i­cal con­cerns of how to touch up an oil paint­ing or mend a crack in a sculp­ture.</p>
    <p>How do you pre­serve a bal­loon that con­tains the artist’s breath (it’s called Artist’s Breath) and that in­evitably is go­ing to de­flate? (Tate Mod­ern.) What about com­put­er­based art when the com­puter or its soft­ware is out of date and can­not work any­more? Or the many pieces that have been cre­ated from flu­o­res­cent lights when the flu­o­res­cent lights are no longer man­u­fac­tured?</p>
    <p>The an­swer, for some, is as high­con­cept as the art.</p>
    <p>“Once you think art is an idea and the ma­te­rial is se­condary, then it does not mat­ter if that ma­te­rial lasts for a long time,” said Ms Melissa Chiu, di­rec­tor of the Hir­sh­horn Mu­seum and Sculp­ture Gar­den at the Smith­so­nian in Washington.</p>
    <p>The Hir­sh­horn has its own con­ser­va­tion spe­cial­ists who tend to art cre­ated from “time-based” ma­te­ri­als that de­grade.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus is so much on the idea that, in some cases, the ma­te­ri­als do not out­last the end of the ex­hi­bi­tion. Like the works in­volv­ing ba­nanas or cous­cous, the art ob­ject is thrown away but the art idea lives on, to be recre­ated in the fu­ture ac­cord­ing to the artist’s in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>A fa­mous ex­am­ple of art cre­ated from or­ganic mat­ter is Yoko Ono’s 1966 Ap­ple, fea­tur­ing an ap­ple on a plex­i­glass pedestal.</p>
    <p>When it was shown at the Mu­seum of Mod­ern Art in 2015, the ap­ple was bought from a store on 53rd Street and re­placed a cou­ple of times over the four weeks of the ex­hi­bi­tion, said Mr Christophe Cherix, one of the cu­ra­tors who put on the show.</p>
    <p>At the Guggen­heim for a 2016 show, Ms Stringari and the mu­seum’s staff cooked cous­cous ac­cord­ing to artist Kader At­tia’s recipe, along with wall­pa­per paste and salt to keep it to­gether and de­ter mould. Her staff, with the help of the artist, used stain­less-steel moulds to recre­ate the model of the desert city of Ghardaia, which At­tia de­signed as a com­men­tary on colo­nial­ism.</p>
    <p>The city in­spired West­ern ar­chi­tects, but they rarely ac­knowl­edged its in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Over the three months of the ex­hi­bi­tion, the mu­seum team mon­i­tored the sculp­ture for pests like bugs. Cracks ap­peared, but that was one of the points, mir­ror­ing the age of the an­cient city. Any cous­cous that fell away was swept up.</p>
    <p>The ideas un­der­pin­ning ephe­meral art of­ten in­evitably in­clude con­cepts like loss, mor­tal­ity, life and death.</p>
    <p>In the case of Co­me­dian, the sub­ject is also the art world it­self – and questions about who de­cides what con­sti­tutes art and the huge amounts of money spent on it.</p>
    <p>One of the buy­ers, Ms Sarah An­del­man, a French fash­ion con­sul­tant and tastemaker, wrote in an email: “It ap­pealed to me for its ab­sur­dity and the ef­fect on the pub­lic. I ob­served all the Basel vis­i­tors tak­ing their selfie and I thought that was such a re­flec­tion of our time.”</p>
    <p>She said she has not hung her Co­me­dian yet. She is still waiting for the in­struc­tions, but added she is in no rush. “What I think I bought is an idea, a con­cept more than a ba­nana with tape,” she said.</p>
    <p>There is no word yet when the Guggen­heim will dis­play it.</p>
