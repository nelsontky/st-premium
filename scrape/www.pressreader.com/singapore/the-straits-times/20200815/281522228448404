    <p>It is pos­si­ble to get Covid-19 from con­tam­i­nated im­ported chilled or frozen food, but the risk is very low, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The coron­avirus that causes Covid-19 re­mains vi­able for at least three weeks at 4 deg C, said Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a senior con­sul­tant in the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the National Univer­sity Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>He re­cently con­cluded a study that i nvolved putting the SarsCoV-2 virus on prawn, salmon and pork, and test­ing its vi­a­bil­ity after three weeks – an am­ple time­frame for such food to be ex­ported and sold, Prof Fisher said.</p>
    <p>Trans­mis­sion through im­ported food has be­come a hot topic fol­low­ing the re-emer­gence of Covid-19 in New Zealand after 102 days with no cases, lead­ing to a lock­down in Auck­land.</p>
    <p>Six of those in­fected work at a cold stor­age fa­cil­ity, rais­ing the pos­si­bil­ity that they may have con­tracted the disease from the im­ported food be­fore spread­ing it to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>China re­cently re­ported find­ing the virus on frozen chicken wings from Brazil, where the pan­demic is rag­ing, and on the outer pack­ag­ing of frozen prawns from Ecuador.</p>
    <p>In June, it said the virus was found in a Bei­jing mar­ket on a chop­ping board used to cut im­ported salmon. There was a clus­ter of more than 200 cases linked to the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, said: “My sense is that although it is cer­tainly pos­si­ble for Sars-CoV-2 to be trans­mit­ted through im­prop­erly han­dled food, the risk is likely to be small.”</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that in­ter­na­tion­ally ac­cepted min­i­mum stan­dards for han­dling food to pre­vent trans­mis­sion of pathogens would also pre­vent the trans­mis­sion of this virus.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, an in­fec­tious dis­eases doc­tor at the National Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said “the prob­a­bil­ity (of in­fec­tion from han­dling food) is in­finites­i­mally small. The like­li­hood of be­ing in­fected by an­other asymp­to­matic or mildly symp­to­matic per­son is far, far higher”.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the school, said his bet is on in­fected peo­ple here catch­ing the coron­avirus from some­one else rather than from im­ported food as there is a hid­den reser­voir of the virus here.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Food Agency said it is mon­i­tor­ing developmen­ts closely and will take the nec­es­sary ac­tions to safe­guard food safety here, though there is no ev­i­dence to show the virus can be trans­mit­ted to peo­ple from food or food pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>It added: “In gen­eral, con­tact with food or food pack­ag­ing and equip­ment is no dif­fer­ent from con­tact with other non-food pack­ag­ing and the en­vi­ron­ment, for ex­am­ple, com­mon touch sur­faces such as lift but­tons, door knobs, etc.”</p>
    <p>While agree­ing that the risk is low, Prof Fisher said: “It is about seed­ing it to one per­son, and then hu­man-to-hu­man (trans­mis­sion) takes over again.</p>
    <p>“We know food pro­cess­ing plants host clus­ters, so it is likely food be­comes con­tam­i­nated. We know the virus can sur­vive the time and tem­per­a­tures for the trip.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said the risk to the av­er­age con­sumer is ex­tremely low, but may be higher for peo­ple work­ing in the chilled food plants han­dling im­ported prod­ucts ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>“But even for some­thing where the chance is very small, when mul­ti­plied across the to­tal num­ber of chilled pack­ages be­ing shipped be­tween lo­ca­tions, a few events will oc­cur over time,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said if in­fec­tion from han­dling food has “hap­pened a hand­ful of times, then it fits with the con­cept of un­likely and not com­mon”, but does not make it im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Re­mind­ing peo­ple to wash their hands and cook their food well, he said that “the first per­son to take the frozen or re­frig­er­ated meat out of the box and then touch his mouth” could be­come a new in­dex case.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said: “The em­pha­sis should be that proper food hy­giene matters both in food cen­tres and at home to pre­vent com­mon food­borne pathogens. The same hy­giene stan­dards should also pro­tect the pub­lic from Covid-19, even in the event that the raw food is con­tam­i­nated with Sars-CoV-2.”</p>
