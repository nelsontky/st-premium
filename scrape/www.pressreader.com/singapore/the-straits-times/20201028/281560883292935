    <p>Even as Sin­ga­pore makes the shift to other clean en­ergy sources, such as so­lar, liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas (LNG) will con­tinue to form a sub­stan­tial part of its en­ergy mix in the near fu­ture. Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Tan See Leng said this yes­ter­day as he an­nounced a to­tal $23 mil­lion award to three firms here that use LNG as their pri­mary source of fuel.</p>
    <p>Even as Sin­ga­pore makes the shift to clean en­ergy sources such as so­lar power, liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas (LNG) will con­tinue to form a sub­stan­tial part of its en­ergy mix in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Tan See Leng said this yes­ter­day as he an­nounced an award of $23 mil­lion in to­tal to three com­pa­nies here that use LNG as their pri­mary source of fuel.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing via video call at the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week (SIEW) 2020 held at Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan noted that al­though LNG is also a fos­sil fuel, it is the clean­est one and coun­tries seek­ing to lower their car­bon emis­sions are in­creas­ingly shift­ing to­wards us­ing it in­stead of coal. “LNG is es­pe­cially at­trac­tive for coun­tries that face con­straints in de­ploy­ing re­new­ables due to lim­i­ta­tions in ge­og­ra­phy, size and a lack of hy­dro or geother­mal re­sources. This is in ad­di­tion to its lower car­bon emis­sions rel­a­tive to other fu­els,” he said.</p>
    <p>To­day, LNG makes up 95 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s en­ergy mix. This is up from 26 per cent when it was first used here in 2001.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said Sin­ga­pore is seen as a nat­u­ral hub for LNG, and the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to di­ver­sify its sources of the fuel and em­power in­dus­try play­ers here to cap­ture new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties, such as an an­tic­i­pated in­crease in global de­mand for nat­u­ral gas.</p>
    <p>The coun­try will also con­tinue to ex­plore new en­ergy so­lu­tions, in­clud­ing hy­dro­gen, he added.</p>
    <p>Hy­dro­gen, when burned, pro­duces wa­ter and no green­house gases. If used in large enough amounts, it could sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce de­mand for fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>At the launch of SIEW 2020 on Mon­day, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said the Gov­ern­ment has set aside $49 mil­lion to fund low-car­bon en­ergy re­search and test-bed­ding ef­forts in hy­dro­gen- and car­bon-cap­ture util­i­sa­tion and stor­age.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said that while nat­u­ral gas is the clean­est fos­sil fuel, us­ing it still gen­er­ates car­bon emis­sions. “This is where hy­dro­gen can play its game-chang­ing role... It too could be­come a bedrock of our econ­omy by help­ing us meet cli­mate change goals and needs.”</p>
    <p>The award by the En­ergy Mar­ket Author­ity (EMA) will see the three com­pa­nies – Senoko En­ergy, Tuas Power Gen­er­a­tion and YTL Pow­erSer­aya – em­bark on en­ergy ef­fi­ciency projects that will re­duce their car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>When com­pleted by 2024, the projects are ex­pected to re­duce the amount of car­bon diox­ide pro­duced by over 30 kilo­tonnes a year. This is the equiv­a­lent of tak­ing about 9,200 cars off the roads an­nu­ally, said EMA.</p>
    <p>The projects of Senoko En­ergy and Tuas Power Gen­er­a­tion in­volve im­prov­ing the ther­mal ef­fi­ciency and per­for­mance of their tur­bines. Tuas Power Gen­er­a­tion and YTL Pow­erSer­aya are also aim­ing to op­ti­mise the per­for­mance of their power plants.</p>
    <p>The award was given out un­der EMA’s in­au­gu­ral Genco En­ergy Ef­fi­ciency Grant Call. A sec­ond round of the grant call will be launched next Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>EMA chief ex­ec­u­tive Ngiam Shih Chun said: “Low­er­ing our car­bon emis­sions by pro­mot­ing greater en­ergy ef­fi­ciency within our power gen­er­a­tion sec­tor is crit­i­cal in our fight against cli­mate change.”</p>
    <p>FLOAT­ING SO­LAR PAN­ELS</p>
    <p>Also speak­ing at SIEW 2020 yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu high­lighted some of Sin­ga­pore’s other sus­tain­abil­ity ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the So­lar En­ergy Re­search In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore and Nor­we­gian or­gan­i­sa­tion Fred. Olsen Re­new­ables to de­velop float­ing pho­to­voltaic so­lu­tions for sea­wa­ter and dif­fer­ent cli­matic con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Sin­ga­pore’s EDB New Ven­tures will be sign­ing a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing with the ven­ture arm of French util­ity gi­ant Engie to build a port­fo­lio of new sus­tain­abil­ity start-ups that will help com­pa­nies here and in South-east Asia de­car­bonise more quickly and prof­itably.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu said: “Th­ese new ven­tures will ac­cel­er­ate the zero-car­bon tran­si­tion, boost em­ploy­ment in a crit­i­cal and grow­ing seg­ment, and es­tab­lish Sin­ga­pore as a hub for sus­tain­abil­ity in­no­va­tion in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“Fight­ing cli­mate change and mak­ing the tran­si­tion to­wards a greener econ­omy will re­quire a con­certed whole-of-na­tion ef­fort by in­dus­tries, in­di­vid­u­als and the Gov­ern­ment.”</p>
