    <p>Reo Nishiguchi faces his big­gest test to­day as Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) lead­ers Al­birex Ni­igata take on Tampines Rovers.</p>
    <p>Nishiguchi, who has found the net in all five matches this sea­son, will face a Stags back­line that has con­ceded just two goals in four games. Both came in their shock 2-1 de­feat by Hougang United when the SPL restarted on Oct 17.</p>
    <p>Tampines won their first three games be­fore the coro­n­avirus halted the sea­son in March. Vic­tory over the Ja­panese side will see them re­turn to the top of the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Both Al­birex and Balestier Khalsa have 11 points but the White Swans have a su­pe­rior goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Nishiguchi had snatched a dra­matic late win­ner in last week’s 3-2 win over the Lion City Sailors but played down his own con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old for­ward from Osaka said: “I will run hard for the team and try to score. Our ul­ti­mate tar­get is to win the ti­tle. I’m happy to score for the team and I’ll fo­cus on one match at a time.</p>
    <p>“(Last week) was the first time this sea­son we won a tight game. I’m happy with the team’s nev­er­say-die spirit and the pre­vi­ous re­sult will give us con­fi­dence for fu­ture games.”</p>
    <p>Al­birex re­main the league’s only un­beaten team and know three points at Our Tampines Hub will be a sig­nif­i­cant boost in claim­ing their fourth league crown in the last five years.</p>
    <p>The sea­son has been short­ened from three to two rounds of fix­tures (each team will play 16 games) be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also caused de­fend­ing champions Brunei DPMM to with­draw from the com­pe­ti­tion as “there are cur­rently no pro­vi­sions in Brunei that al­low them to travel to Sin­ga­pore”, the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore an­nounced on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>But Al­birex head coach Keiji Shige­tomi is not think­ing of sil­ver­ware yet, say­ing his pri­or­ity is to cor­rect the mis­takes from their last out­ing against the Sailors.</p>
    <p>He cred­ited Nishiguchi’s per­for­mance to a re­sult of “good team play” and noted: “I am happy with the win against Sailors as the play­ers showed fight­ing spirit all the way. We have to work on the goals con­ceded and im­prove our con­trol of the tempo of the game.</p>
    <p>“Tampines have many good at­tack­ing play­ers, so we have to de­fend well against them as a team. This match is im­por­tant for us, so our play­ers will be fo­cused on get­ting the win.”</p>
    <p>It has been two weeks since Tampines’ sur­prise loss to Hougang and coach Gavin Lee has had plenty of time to an­a­lyse what went wrong.</p>
    <p>Lee, 30, said: “The re­sult was dis­ap­point­ing but there was no lack of ef­fort in that game.</p>
    <p>“Al­birex are a good side, so we need to per­form at 100 per cent. We just need to re­main calm and work on our usual play­ing prin­ci­ples each day to main­tain our qual­ity.</p>
    <p>“We’ve watched ev­ery game they’ve played this sea­son and they have a striker scor­ing goals.</p>
    <p>“But we’re not just look­ing at the per­son who fin­ishes, we’re look­ing at how they’re cre­at­ing those chances as well and mak­ing sure we play at our best against them.”</p>
