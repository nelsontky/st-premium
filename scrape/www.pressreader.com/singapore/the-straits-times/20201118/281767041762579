    <p>SYD­NEY • The Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties con­ducted mass tests yes­ter­day, and about 4,000 peo­ple were con­fined to quar­an­tine in a bid to sti­fle a new clus­ter of cases of the coro­n­avirus fol­low­ing hopes that it had been largely erad­i­cated.</p>
    <p>The state of South Aus­tralia reim­posed so­cial dis­tanc­ing curbs on Mon­day af­ter de­tect­ing 21 cases of Covid-19, most of which were ac­quired lo­cally. The cases were the first lo­cal trans­mis­sions of the virus in Aus­tralia in nine days.</p>
    <p>South Aus­tralia Premier Steven Mar­shall said test­ing had iden­ti­fied five new cases in the pre­vi­ous 24 hours, while 14 peo­ple were sus­pected to be in­fected and await­ing test re­sults. “We are not out of the woods. We are just at the be­gin­ning stages of deal­ing with this par­tic­u­lar very nasty clus­ter,” he told re­porters in Ade­laide.</p>
    <p>He said all cases could be traced back to an Aus­tralian who ar­rived in the state from over­seas on Nov 2 and en­tered manda­tory quar­an­tine in a ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel work­ers are be­lieved to have con­tracted the virus af­ter touch­ing a surface con­tam­i­nated with it, Mr Mar­shall said.</p>
    <p>There is fear the virus could have spread be­yond ho­tel work­ers and their close con­tacts, prompt­ing a man­date that con­fined about 4,000 peo­ple to their homes.</p>
    <p>“This is a very, very wor­ry­ing sit­u­a­tion. I’m not go­ing to un­der­es­ti­mate the con­cern that I’ve got about this,” said South Aus­tralia’s chief pub­lic health of­fi­cer Ni­cola Spurrier.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded about 27,800 coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and 906 deaths.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the in­fec­tions were in Vic­to­ria state, which forced nearly five mil­lion peo­ple into a strin­gent lockdown for more than 100 days af­ter a surge in cases. That out­break has been con­tained, with Vic­to­ria record­ing no new cases for the past 16 days.</p>
