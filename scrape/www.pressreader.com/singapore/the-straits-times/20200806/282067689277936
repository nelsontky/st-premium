    <p>A man was charged yes­ter­day with one count of as­sault fol­low­ing the re­lease of a video clip which showed a dis­pute in­volv­ing a fe­male cleaner at a hawker cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Phua Meng Wee, 44, was also charged with us­ing crim­i­nal force on the cleaner, Ms Ho Gek Yeow.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is ac­cused of throw­ing a plate of rice at her back at Qual­ity Road Food Cen­tre in Qual­ity Road near Jalan Boon Lay at about 11am on Feb 5.</p>
    <p>He al­legedly pushed Ms Ho three min­utes later, caus­ing her to fall.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not re­veal the rea­son be­hind the dis­pute.</p>
    <p>An­other man, known only as Andy, sent a video of the in­ci­dent to cit­i­zen jour­nal­ism web­site Stomp.</p>
    <p>The ap­prox­i­mately 10-sec­ond clip shows a woman fall­ing onto the floor of a hawker cen­tre as sev­eral din­ers look on.</p>
    <p>A man stand­ing nearby ges­tic­u­lates at her be­fore walk­ing away.</p>
    <p>The woman gets up and tries to go af­ter him, but is stopped by an on­looker.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Tues­day, the po­lice said they “have zero tol­er­ance to­wards such acts of vi­o­lence and will not hes­i­tate to take ac­tion against those who bla­tantly dis­re­gard the law”.</p>
    <p>Phua’s pre-trial con­fer­ence will be held on Sept 2.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of as­sault, he can be jailed for up to three years and fined up to $5,000.</p>
    <p>Any­one con­victed of us­ing crim­i­nal force on an­other per­son can be jailed for up to three months and fined up to $1,500.</p>
