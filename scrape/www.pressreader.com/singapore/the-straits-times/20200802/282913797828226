    <p>A sur­vey aimed at find­ing out how adept Sin­ga­pore­ans are in dig­i­tal bank­ing has un­cov­ered a sur­pris­ing and dis­con­cert­ing trend – one in 10 young peo­ple may not even have a bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>The find­ing from the HSBC Bank poll, which sur­veyed 1,100 Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above in April, was un­ex­pected to say the least.</p>
    <p>It noted that 10 per cent of those aged 18 to 24 said that they do not have an ac­count, ei­ther solely or jointly with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>This trend con­tin­ues for the two sub-groups in the 25 to 44 age group, al­beit in smaller num­bers – 5 per cent and 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Another find­ing in the HSBC poll showed that 60 per cent of those who do not have ac­counts are men.</p>
    <p>One ex­pla­na­tion for why those un­der 24 do not have an ac­count is that some of them could be stu­dents who are still de­pen­dent on their par­ents’ al­lowances and credit cards and so do not yet see the need to sign up with a bank.</p>
    <p>As for the rest, not hav­ing an ac­count could mean that they are ei­ther out of work or have ir­reg­u­lar in­comes as free­lancers.</p>
    <p>But this is not a good po­si­tion for ei­ther group be­cause it makes it hard for them to save for rainy days, let alone plan for their fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Ian Yim, head of wealth and in­ter­na­tional at HSBC Sin­ga­pore, has another take on this sit­u­a­tion, say­ing the bank has no­ticed a sim­i­lar trend among a small group of young peo­ple in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“Cer­tain fac­tors such as dis­trust or in­con­ve­nience might be caus­ing some Sin­ga­pore­ans to have no de­sire to use banks for their fi­nan­cial needs,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Yim be­lieves the so­lu­tion lies in ed­u­cat­ing these youth about the value of a bank ac­count while also high­light­ing that dig­i­tal bank­ing is mak­ing the whole process eas­ier and more con­ve­nient.</p>
    <p>He says: “This is why I see the need to con­tinue rais­ing fi­nan­cial lit­er­acy es­pe­cially among our youth, and of­fer a ro­bust dig­i­tal bank­ing plat­form as it will make it eas­ier for peo­ple to ac­cess fi­nan­cial ser­vices with­out the need to visit a bank branch.”</p>
    <p>This ap­pears to be the right ap­proach to serve most cus­tomers be­cause about 75 per cent of these folks fre­quently bank on­line, according to the HSBC sur­vey.</p>
    <p>MORE USE SMART­PHONES THAN PCS</p>
    <p>Most of those who e-bank pre­fer do­ing it on the go us­ing bank apps down­loaded on their phones. In­deed, when it comes to smart­phone bank­ing, Sin­ga­pore­ans (75 per cent) are more pro­fi­cient in the use of apps than bank cus­tomers in Hong Kong (61 per cent).</p>
    <p>The top two trans­ac­tions car­ried out on these apps are check­ing ac­count bal­ances and pay­ing bills.</p>
    <p>About half of those who e-bank reg­u­larly are also com­fort­able us­ing their phones to per­form more com­plex tasks such as ap­ply­ing for credit cards, loans and even set­ting aside money for in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>IS CASH STILL KING?</p>
    <p>With so much money be­ing moved around on­line, does that mean cash trans­ac­tions in banks are head­ing the way of the di­nosaur?</p>
    <p>Not so soon, if over 25 per cent of bank cus­tomers here have their say. This group still prefers to turn up per­son­ally at a branch or find the near­est ATM to per­form sim­ple tasks such as check­ing of ac­count bal­ances.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, this group also prefers talk­ing to some­one face to face when it comes to ap­ply­ing for credit cards or loans.</p>
    <p>But the least pre­ferred mode of bank­ing is speak­ing over the phone – only be­tween 4 per cent and 14 per cent of bank cus­tomers choose to do this for all kinds of trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>So banks will do bet­ter to take note – they should cut down the use of tele­mar­ket­ing and in­stead come up with more in­ter­est­ing and cre­ative e-mails and mes­sages to tar­get the ma­jor­ity of cus­tomers who pre­fer to let their fin­gers do the “talk­ing” on their smart­phones.</p>
    <p>NOT REG­U­LAR WITH IN­VEST­MENTS</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also showed that when it comes to in­vest­ing, 32 per cent of those polled say they have never made an in­vest­ment while 16 per cent say they do so only once in a while.</p>
    <p>About 7 per cent of reg­u­lar in­vestors say they do it at least once a year while 40 per cent say they will in­vest at least twice a year.</p>
    <p>As for the mode of in­vest­ments, the pro­por­tion is split al­most equally – half pre­fer do­ing so with the help of bank staff while the other half are com­fort­able do­ing it on their own on­line.</p>
    <p>But only about 10 per cent of those who in­vest on­line are prepared to put in over $10,000.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, bank cus­tomers in Hong Kong are more mon­ey­minded than Sin­ga­pore­ans – a sim­i­lar HSBC sur­vey there found that 70 per cent, or al­most dou­ble the num­bers here, in­vest at least twice a year.</p>
    <p>As bank cus­tomers start to be more com­fort­able with e-bank­ing, there is a need for banks to of­fer bet­ter ser­vices, be­yond sim­ple dig­i­tal pay­ments and trans­fers.</p>
    <p>To stay rel­e­vant, banks must be able to al­low cus­tomers to shop and pay eas­ily and safely on e-com­merce sites or even trans­act among one another on so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Fraud is a ma­jor im­ped­i­ment to the growth of on­line trans­ac­tions, so j ust as the Gov­ern­ment has blocked ac­cess to du­bi­ous web­sites, banks would do well to look into ways of blocking trans­ac­tions at e-stores that have been the sub­ject of com­plaints by cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Although there has been much talk on the use of “big data” to pre­dict spend­ing pat­terns, we have yet to see how on­line ser­vices have started to be more in­tu­itive to serve us bet­ter.</p>
    <p>For now, banks do well in get­ting the basics right but even as they im­prove their dig­i­tal ser­vices, there will still be a need for phys­i­cal branches and other hu­man con­tact points, es­pe­cially for more com­plex needs such as wealth man­age­ment and in­sur­ance so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Yim says HSBC has launched new dig­i­tal ex­pe­ri­ences, in­clud­ing:</p>
    <p>• Vir­tual in­vest­ment meet­ings that are prov­ing use­ful dur­ing the coron­avirus pan­demic. Cus­tomers ap­pend their sig­na­tures se­curely on doc­u­ments as well as use HSBC’s Wealth Port­fo­lio Plus soft­ware to con­duct in­vest­ment re­views and plan­ning.</p>
    <p>• Self-ser­vice on­line por­tals that en­able cus­tomers to per­form tra­di­tional tasks such as ap­ply­ing for loans and open­ing sav­ings ac­counts.</p>
    <p>• On­line plat­forms that al­low cus­tomers to trade in equities, unit trusts and for­eign ex­change. These plat­forms come with cus­tomer-spe­cific in­sights which en­able users to make in­formed decisions. HSBC says its on­line sales vol­ume for unit trusts has in­creased three­fold re­cently while eq­uity trades are up sev­en­fold.</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL LIT­ER­ACY</p>
    <p>Cer­tain fac­tors such as dis­trust or in­con­ve­nience might be caus­ing some Sin­ga­pore­ans to have no de­sire to use banks for their fi­nan­cial needs...</p>
    <p>I see the need to con­tinue rais­ing fi­nan­cial lit­er­acy es­pe­cially among our youth, and of­fer a ro­bust dig­i­tal bank­ing plat­form as it will make it eas­ier for peo­ple to ac­cess fi­nan­cial ser­vices with­out the need ’’ to visit a bank branch.</p>
    <p>MR IAN YIM, head of wealth and in­ter­na­tional at HSBC Sin­ga­pore, on the bank­ing trend among young peo­ple. He be­lieves the so­lu­tion lies in ed­u­cat­ing them about the value of a bank ac­count, while also high­light­ing that dig­i­tal bank­ing is mak­ing the process eas­ier.</p>
    <p>But Mr Yim says cash will al­ways have a place in our so­ci­ety, even as the mode of pay­ments and trans­ac­tions has changed.</p>
    <p>“We have wit­nessed an in­crease in adop­tion of dig­i­tal trans­ac­tions in re­cent years and the Covid-19 pan­demic has fur­ther ac­cel­er­ated this trend.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing said this, un­til cash­less pay­ments are ac­cepted by a wider au­di­ence, es­pe­cially among small busi­nesses, cash would have a role to play,” he points out.</p>
