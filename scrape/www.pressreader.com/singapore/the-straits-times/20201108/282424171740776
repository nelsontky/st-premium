    <p>Hand­made with smooth and sup­ple skin en­cas­ing crunchy ji­cama fill­ing, the Soon Kueh ($1 a piece, $1.80 for two) at Luan Jie Mei Shi is eas­ily its star dish.</p>
    <p>But it is the item that sec­ond­gen­er­a­tion hawker Teo Hock Meng, 46, dreads mak­ing the most, be­cause of the sheer amount of el­bow grease it ex­acts. It takes him five hours each night to make 200 soon kueh by hand.</p>
    <p>The stall also sells tra­di­tional snacks such as yam cake, pump­kin cake and gluti­nous rice, which are hand­made by Mr Teo.</p>
    <p>His par­ents – Madam Wang Hee Luan, 71, and Mr Teo Kia Tian, 72 – started the stall at Amoy Street Food Cen­tre in 2004.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo Hock Meng, who has a master’s de­gree in rail­way sys­tem en­gi­neer­ing, quit his job as an en­gi­neer in 2011 to learn to make kueh from them. His par­ents re­fused to teach him at first, as they wanted him to stay in en­gi­neer­ing for its bet­ter prospects.</p>
    <p>He says: “I wanted to pre­serve my par­ents’ legacy and con­vinced them I could take the hard work.</p>
    <p>“I thought, how dif­fi­cult can it be to wrap soon kueh? I found out after I got ten­nis el­bow from rolling out the dough.”</p>
    <p>He starts work ev­ery evening at 7pm and car­ries on through the night so cus­tomers can en­joy the freshly steamed kueh when the stall opens at 6am.</p>
    <p>For the soon kueh fill­ing, he grates ji­cama and shreds car­rot by hand. He then stir-fries the fill­ing, which in­cludes plenty of dried mush­rooms and dried prawns.</p>
    <p>Pre­par­ing the fill­ing is a piece of cake com­pared with mak­ing the soon kueh skin. It is a 25-minute in­ten­sive arm work­out to knead the tapi­oca starch-based dough, fol­lowed by four painstak­ing hours of rolling out in­di­vid­ual wrap­pers.</p>
    <p>The re­sult of all that man­ual labour is soon kueh with a thin, translu­cent skin that is springy and elas­tic enough to hold a gen­er­ous mound of flavour­some fill­ing and not fall apart when one bites into it.</p>
    <p>Un­like other places, his soon kueh does not con­tain bam­boo shoots. The crisp tex­ture of the ji­cama is al­lur­ing and ad­dic­tive enough.</p>
    <p>He does not use pork or lard in his cook­ing for a health­ier and lighter taste.</p>
    <p>The Yam Cake ($3) is made us­ing round Thai yam, which costs twice as much as Malaysian yam. He prefers Thai yam for its fine, pow­dery tex­ture and richer flavour.</p>
    <p>The Pump­kin Cake ($3) is pre­pared with pump­kin, tossed with plenty of dried prawns and dried mush­rooms.</p>
    <p>The Chee Cheong Fun ($1.40) is not made in-house, but the ac­com­pa­ny­ing sweet sauce and chilli sauce are pre­pared by Mr Teo’s par­ents.</p>
    <p>If you still have room in your stom­ach, take away some Gluti­nous Rice ($2), which has a win­ning tex­ture, more so than flavour. The rice is stir-fried then steamed, such that each grain is per­fectly cooked.</p>
    <p>Pro tip: Cus­tomers in the know or­der a com­bi­na­tion of yam cake and pump­kin cake for $3. Or a mix of yam cake, pump­kin cake and chee cheong fun for $4.40.</p>
