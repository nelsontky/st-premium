    <p>Hougang United ended their three-match los­ing run in the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) with a 3-2 come­back win over bot­tom side Tan­jong Pa­gar United yes­ter­day that also re­vived their AFC Cup qual­i­fi­ca­tion bid.</p>
    <p>Head coach Cle­ment Teo was sat­is­fied to col­lect three points after watch­ing his team fall be­hind to Far­i­hin Farkhan’s 22nd-minute opener but ad­mit­ted Hougang were sloppy at crit­i­cal mo­ments.</p>
    <p>He said: “Play­ing an all-lo­cal team makes me a lit­tle happy but it’s very un­for­tu­nate that there were still er­rors we had ad­justed in train­ing. The play­ers need to be more dis­ci­plined in what they’re be­ing as­signed to do.</p>
    <p>“The en­ergy level go­ing for­ward is some­thing we were very crit­i­cal about.</p>
    <p>“It showed when we started break­ing and cross­ing early and for­tu­nately An­ders (Aplin) was there to score (the sec­ond goal).”</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors’ lead at Hougang Sta­dium lasted just three min­utes as Tan­jong Pa­gar’s Yann Motta con­ceded a penalty which Shawal Anuar con­verted. Aplin’s sec­ond-half header then put them ahead but a mis­take from goal­keeper Rid­huan Barudin, who spilled Luiz Ju­nior’s shot into sub­sti­tute Suria Prakash’s path, lev­elled the game.</p>
    <p>Rid­huan made up for his ear­lier er­ror by pro­duc­ing im­por­tant saves to deny Sho­dai Nishikawa and Ju­nior, be­fore Hougang earned a sec­ond penalty in the 88th minute. Sub­sti­tute Shah­fiq Ghani made no mis­take to de­liver a much-needed win for the hosts.</p>
    <p>Hougang are sixth in the eight­team SPL on 15 points but, cru­cially, just one be­hind both Balestier Khalsa and Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional. Their clash yes­ter­day ended 2-0 in Balestier’s favour.</p>
    <p>With two games left, all three are still vy­ing for a berth in next year’s</p>
    <p>AFC Cup group stage.</p>
    <p>Hougang’s next match is at home against Balestier on Wed­nes­day, be­fore they end their cam­paign against lead­ers Al­birex Ni­igata next Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Aplin, 29, called on his team­mates for one fi­nal push. He said: “Our per­for­mance is a step up from our last few games... We just tried to rally our­selves and put in a good per­for­mance and we got the re­sult, which is good and takes us very nicely into the last two games.”</p>
    <p>For Tan­jong Pa­gar, who are still win­less after 12 games, the wait goes on. Team man­ager Noh Alam Shah said: “We were un­lucky but we’re the one who gave away all the goals with a lack of fo­cus.</p>
