    <p>NUM­BER OF RES­I­DENTS WORK­ING HERE IN SEPTEM­BER, JUST 0.4% SHY OF THE 2.35 MIL­LION IN SEPTEM­BER LAST YEAR |</p>
    <p>Hopes for a bet­ter 2021 are aplenty, but re­cov­ery for t he labour mar­ket is likely to be pro­tracted, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>Although the lat­est quar­terly labour mar­ket data re­leased ear­lier this month shows the em­ploy­ment sit­u­a­tion for Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents is on the mend, un­cer­tain­ties still abound.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy, said it may take till 2022 for un­em­ploy­ment rates to re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els, bar­ring a Covid-19 panacea.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest chal­lenge is not re­ally new per se – that there is a sig­nif­i­cant SME (small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prise) base and older, low-in­come work­ers and even PMETs (pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians) who may find the pace of change ac­cel­er­ated and dis­rup­tive and have a more dif­fi­cult time adapt­ing and trans­form­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen how the labour mar­ket will re­act next year when the Jobs Sup­port Scheme wage sub­si­dies ta­per off and some of the trainee­ships, at­tach­ments and train­ing pro­grammes in­tro­duced to help job seek­ers end.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ng Chee Meng said in a re­cent we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by The Straits Times that the lo­cal and global health sit­u­a­tion will be a big fac­tor in de­ter­min­ing how the econ­omy re­cov­ers from its low base this year.</p>
    <p>Some sec­tors are likely to stay muted, namely avi­a­tion and aero­space, en­gi­neer­ing clus­ters that sup­port those sec­tors, and hos­pi­tal­ity and tourism. But health­care, biotech and lo­gis­tics should trend pos­i­tively over­all, he said.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic roiled the labour mar­ket this year, and the im­pact showed up in ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>Also, the to­tal num­ber of peo­ple em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore dropped off a cliff in the April to June quar­ter, which co­in­cided with the twom­onth cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. Em­ploy­ment, ex­clud­ing that of for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, fell by a record 103,800 in that quar­ter.</p>
    <p>To mit­i­gate the im­pact of the cri­sis on the job mar­ket, the Gov­ern­ment rolled out ag­gres­sive job and train­ing sup­port schemes start­ing from the Bud­get in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Th­ese came in the form of wage sub­si­dies un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme and, later, the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive, as well as through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age un­der which about 180,000 job open­ings, trainee­ships or at­tach­ments, and train­ing places have been made avail­able to job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>By the third quar­ter of the year – the lat­est labour mar­ket data avail­able – em­ploy­ment lev­els of Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents had re­bounded. There were 2.34 mil­lion res­i­dents work­ing here in Septem­ber, just 0.4 per cent shy of the 2.35 mil­lion in Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Job va­can­cies also shot up in Septem­ber for the first time all year, a sign that de­mand from em­ploy­ers could be on the mend.</p>
    <p>How­ever, re­trench­ments con­tin­ued to climb in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>2022</p>
    <p>The year when un­em­ploy­ment rates may re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els, bar­ring a Covid-19 panacea.</p>
