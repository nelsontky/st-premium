    <p>De­fy­ing ex­pec­ta­tions, the stork vis­ited Sin­ga­pore last year and in­creased its num­ber of de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>The Re­port on Reg­is­tra­tion of Births and Deaths 2019 said 39,279 births were reg­is­tered last year, an in­crease of 0.6 per cent from 2018.</p>
    <p>This bucks a de­clin­ing trend which hit an eight-year low in 2018.</p>
    <p>The me­dian age of res­i­dent live births for first-time moth­ers inched up from 30.6 in 2018 to 30.8 years last year. In com­par­i­son, the me­dian age in 2009 was 29.7 years.</p>
    <p>At the same time, a grey­ing pop­u­la­tion means deaths have been on an up­ward tra­jec­tory since at least 2010, when there were 17,610 deaths.</p>
    <p>There were 21,446 deaths last year, an in­crease of 0.8 per cent from 21,282 in 2018, ac­cord­ing to the re­port by the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity.</p>
    <p>More men died than women, and from dif­fer­ent causes.</p>
    <p>A higher pro­por­tion of men died from heart and hy­per­ten­sive diseases and ac­ci­dents, while women were more likely to die from kid­ney and dis­or­ders of the uri­nary sys­tem, and cere­brovas­cu­lar diseases.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the in­crease in births, Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) so­ci­ol­ogy pro­fes­sor Jean Ye­ung said the chil­dren of the baby­boomer gen­er­a­tion are now go­ing through the child-bear­ing life stage.</p>
    <p>“The in­crease may re­flect cou­ples catch­ing up af­ter post­pon­ing child­bear­ing for awhile,” she said. “It may also re­flect the im­pact of the greater sub­si­dies the Gov­ern­ment has been pro­vid­ing for as­sisted fer­til­ity treat­ments in the last few years.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity so­ci­ol­ogy pro­fes­sor Paulin</p>
    <p>Straughan said at­ten­tion should be paid to the de­mo­graphic pro­file of new moth­ers, es­pe­cially if their age at first child­birth is in­creas­ing. A de­lay in fam­ily for­ma­tion trans­lates to smaller fam­ily sizes, she said.</p>
    <p>“Many may not fully ap­pre­ci­ate how hard it is to con­ceive nat­u­rally when they start fam­ily plan­ning later, and how painful it is emo­tion­ally and phys­i­cally, when they have to rely on as­sisted re­pro­duc­tive tech­nol­ogy to re­alise their par­ent­hood as­pi­ra­tions.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal fer­til­ity rate dipped from 1.16 in 2017 to 1.14 last year. For the pop­u­la­tion to re­place it­self with­out im­mi­gra­tion, women need to have an av­er­age of 2.1 ba­bies.</p>
    <p>NUS so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser said it is not sur­pris­ing that there has been an uptick in deaths, given Sin­ga­pore’s rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially so for older co­horts: 17,993 of those who died last year – ac­count­ing for 83.9 per cent of to­tal deaths – were aged 60 years and above, com­pared with 13,485 in 2010.</p>
    <p>Dr Pei-Chun Ko, a lec­turer at the Cen­tre for Univer­sity Core at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences, said the in­crease in deaths from lung, heart and hy­per­ten­sive diseases may im­ply the need to look into the chronic con­di­tions of older Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Na­tional Pop­u­la­tion and Tal­ent Di­vi­sion (NPTD) said that year-on-year fluc­tu­a­tions should be con­sid­ered against the back­drop of longert­erm trends.</p>
    <p>“The longer-term mar­riage and birth trends re­main pos­i­tive, and in­di­cate that Sin­ga­pore­ans con­tinue to value set­tling down and form­ing fam­i­lies,” said the NPTD.</p>
    <p>It noted that to bet­ter sup­port Sin­ga­pore­ans who would like to get mar­ried and have chil­dren, the Gov­ern­ment en­hanced the Mar­riage and Par­ent­hood Pack­age last year to help with pre-school, health­care and hous­ing costs.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to work closely with em­ploy­ers and the com­mu­nity to build a Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety that is ‘Made For Fam­i­lies’,” it said.</p>
