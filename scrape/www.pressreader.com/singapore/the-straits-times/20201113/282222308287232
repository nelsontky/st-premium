    <p>• The In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency (IEA) cut fore­casts for global oil de­mand amid new lock­down mea­sures and cau­tioned that the vac­cine break­through will not quickly re­vive mar­kets.</p>
    <p>While crude prices ral­lied to a 10-week high above US$45 this week on news of Pfizer’s progress, fuel use will not ex­pe­ri­ence any “sig­nif­i­cant” boost from vac­cines un­til the sec­ond half of next year, said the agency.</p>
    <p>The Paris-based IEA, which ad­vises most ma­jor economies, re­duced oil de­mand pro­jec­tions for this quar­ter sharply – by 1.2 mil­lion bar­rels a day.</p>
    <p>Fu­tures fluc­tu­ated be­tween gains and losses near US$41 a bar­rel fol­low­ing the forecast.</p>
    <p>The fal­ter­ing out­look for con­sump­tion, com­bined with ris­ing sup­ply in places such as Libya, puts pres­sure on the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Pe­tro­leum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries (Opec) car­tel and its al­lies as they pre­pare to meet in just un­der three weeks, said the IEA.</p>
    <p>The Opec+ al­liance, led by Saudi Ara­bia and Rus­sia, had ini­tially aimed to re­store some of the sup­ply they are keep­ing off­line at the start of next year but is in­creas­ingly fo­cused on de­lay­ing the move.</p>
    <p>The IEA, in its monthly re­port, said that “with a Covid-19 vac­cine un­likely to ride to the res­cue of the global oil mar­ket for some time, the com­bi­na­tion of weaker de­mand and ris­ing oil sup­ply pro­vides a dif­fi­cult back­drop” to the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>It added: “Un­less the fun­da­men­tals change, the task of re­bal­anc­ing the mar­ket will make slow progress.”</p>
    <p>If Opec+ does pro­ceed with its sched­uled sup­ply in­crease of al­most two mil­lion bar­rels a day in Jan­uary, the pro­duc­ers will fail to de­plete global oil in­ven­to­ries dur­ing the first quar­ter, said the agency.</p>
    <p>Bring­ing stock­piles, swollen by this year’s de­mand col­lapse, back to nor­mal levels has been one of the coali­tion’s key goals.</p>
    <p>Data now avail­able for the third quar­ter sug­gests that in­ven­to­ries fell by barely a third of the ex­pected amount, de­clin­ing by 800,000 bar­rels a day, said the agency.</p>
    <p>Global oil con­sump­tion is on track to slump by an un­prece­dented 8.8 mil­lion bar­rels a day this year, av­er­ag­ing 91.3 mil­lion a day, ac­cord­ing to the IEA.</p>
    <p>It also trimmed es­ti­mates for next year, low­er­ing its firstquar­ter pro­jec­tion by 700,000 bar­rels a day, though de­mand is still set to stage a re­bound of 5.8 mil­lion bar­rels on av­er­age next year.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the chal­lenge of de­te­ri­o­rat­ing de­mand, Opec also has to reckon with a sur­pris­ing re­bound in sup­ply.</p>
    <p>World out­put could be one mil­lion bar­rels a day higher this month as the United States re­cov­ers from hur­ri­cane dis­rup­tions and Libya re­sumes ex­ports, said the agency.</p>
    <p>Libya, one of three Opec na­tions ex­empt from the agree­ment to re­strain out­put, tre­bled pro­duc­tion to 450,000 bar­rels a day last month as its po­lit­i­cal tu­mult abated, said the IEA.</p>
    <p>It is now pump­ing more than one mil­lion bar­rels a day and could av­er­age just be­low this level this month, the agency pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>Oil has surged al­most 12 per cent this week, with most of the gains com­ing af­ter news of a Covid-19 vac­cine break­through.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the global stock rally spurred by t he news showed signs of stalling in Asia as in­vestors as­sess a de­te­ri­o­rat­ing coro­n­avirus out­look i n many large economies around the world.</p>
    <p>CMC Mar­kets chief mar­ket strate­gist Michael McCarthy said: “In the short term, we are look­ing for more gains for oil.</p>
    <p>“The vac­cine won’t have any im­pact on de­mand un­til it can be de­ployed but the turn­around in mar­ket think­ing means oil will be able to hold on to these levels.”</p>
