    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is set for a strong re­cov­ery next year af­ter a deeper-than-ex­pected slump amid the coro­n­avirus pandemic, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by the Asean+3 Macroe­co­nomic Re­search Of­fice (Amro).</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) will ex­pand by 7 per cent next year, af­ter shrink­ing 6 per cent this year, Amro said in its Au­gust up­date of the Asean+3 Re­gional Eco­nomic Out­look 2020 re­port re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The GDP growth fore­cast for 2020 was down­graded from Amro’s ear­lier pro­jec­tion of 0.8 per cent re­leased in March.</p>
    <p>Amro’s chief econ­o­mist Hoe Ee Khor said Sin­ga­pore’s re­cov­ery will start to take shape in the sec­ond half of this year, aided by the man­u­fac­tur­ing and fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tors, which have per­formed rel­a­tively bet­ter than other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>As more mi­grant work­ers are tested for Covid-19 and cleared for work, the con­struc­tion sec­tor will also start to con­trib­ute to growth in earnest later this year and fur­ther boost the re­cov­ery for next year.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect Sin­ga­pore to bounce back strongly in the sec­ond half and into 2021,” Dr Khor said in a vir­tual me­dia brief­ing. How­ever, ser­vice sec­tors such as tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity will con­tinue to suf­fer un­til a coro­n­avirus vac­cine is widely avail­able to al­low the lift­ing of curbs on in­ter­na­tional travel, he noted.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try ex­pects Sin­ga­pore’s GDP to shrink by 4 per cent to 7 per cent this year. So far, there is no of­fi­cial fore­cast for next year.</p>
    <p>Across the 14-mem­ber Asean+3 re­gion, Amro ex­pects a U-shaped re­cov­ery, led by China. Growth across the re­gion is ex­pected to slow sharply this year to zero per cent, from 4.8 per cent last year, be­fore re­bound­ing strongly to 6 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>Strict con­tain­ment mea­sures to pre­vent the virus from spread­ing caused economies to come to a stand­still, lead­ing to mas­sive in­creases in un­em­ploy­ment, dis­rup­tions to busi­nesses and wide­spread col­lapse in do­mes­tic de­mand. Bans on in­ter­na­tional travel have dec­i­mated the re­gion’s all-im­por­tant tourism sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Nine of the 14 economies are ex­pected to contract this year, with pos­i­tive growth rates pro­jected for China, Brunei, Laos, Myan­mar, and Viet­nam. Amro’s growth tra­jec­tory is pred­i­cated on the ef­fec­tive con­tain­ment of Covid-19, both re­gion­ally and glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The resur­gence in in­fec­tions in some parts of the re­gion and else­where has height­ened cau­tion about an­other spate of lock­downs, which the Asean+3 economies can ill af­ford, even though most still have some fis­cal and mon­e­tary space to pro­vide sup­port if needed, Amro said.</p>
    <p>Dr Li Lian Ong, Amro’s act­ing group head for re­gional sur­veil­lance, said: “The big­gest chal­lenge fac­ing Asean+3 pol­i­cy­mak­ers in the sec­ond half of 2020 will be bal­anc­ing the trade-off be­tween eas­ing re­stric­tions to re­vive their economies and risk­ing an­other wave of in­fec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, the man­ner in which the exit from the raft of pandemic poli­cies is man­aged will be key to en­sur­ing eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity, ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments would have to with­draw fi­nan­cial sup­port to non­fi­nan­cial cor­po­ra­tions and in­di­vid­u­als to main­tain the sound­ness of fis­cal fi­nance, while bal­anc­ing against cor­po­rate bank­rupt­cies and un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tors must de­sign the exit from reg­u­la­tory for­bear­ance ap­pro­pri­ately to avoid mo­ral haz­ards, while guard­ing against any sud­den shock to bank bal­ance sheets.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral banks should ter­mi­nate their liq­uid­ity in­jec­tions into the fi­nan­cial sys­tem to avoid the de­vel­op­ment of as­set bub­bles and in­fla­tion­ary pres­sures while guard­ing against an ex­ces­sive tight­en­ing of credit con­di­tions, the re­port added.</p>
