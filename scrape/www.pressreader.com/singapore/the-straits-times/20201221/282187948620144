    <p>Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) mem­ber Brad Bowyer has ques­tioned the need for the wear­ing of masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to con­tinue, draw­ing re­buke from his fel­low party mate for his “ir­re­spon­si­ble” com­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Bowyer, who con­tested the gen­eral elec­tion ear­lier this year as part of the PSP’s team in Nee Soon GRC, also ex­pressed his dis­trust in Covid-19 vac­cines in a Face­book post last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, fel­low PSP mem­ber Kala Man­ickam, who also stood for elec­tion in Nee Soon GRC, crit­i­cised Mr Bowyer’s post in a com­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Man­ickam said she was dis­ap­pointed that Mr Bowyer was triv­i­al­is­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, adding: “Be­ing a Covid-19 sur­vivor, I am ex­tremely dis­turbed by the mis­in­for­ma­tion and fear you are spread­ing.”</p>
    <p>She told The Straits Times that she tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Aug 27. She was her mother’s ap­proved care­giver dur­ing a 14-day quar­an­tine her mother served af­ter re­turn­ing from In­dia on Aug 14. Her mother also tested pos­i­tive on Aug 26.</p>
    <p>Ms Man­ickam said in her com­ment on Mr Bowyer’s post that while there were gaps in com­mu­ni­ca­tion from the Gov­ern­ment in the early months of the out­break, she be­lieved it has “gen­er­ally done well in the past few months since the elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>The com­pul­sory wear­ing of masks, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and cal­i­brated re­open­ing of the econ­omy are im­por­tant mea­sures to safe­guard the com­mu­nity, she added.</p>
    <p>“In the midst of a pub­lic health pan­demic, we should not spread con­spir­acy the­o­ries on vac­cines like what you are do­ing here,” she</p>
    <p>said. “We have to fol­low the lead of the Gov­ern­ment and health pro­fes­sion­als to keep our peo­ple safe. Surely the econ­omy can­not be more im­por­tant than hu­man be­ings.”</p>
    <p>In his post, Mr Bowyer ques­tioned why Sin­ga­pore was not able to en­ter phase three of its re­open­ing ear­lier in­stead of on Dec 28, given that there have been “vir­tu­ally no new cases in the com­mu­nity for months”.</p>
    <p>He also crit­i­cised the Gov­ern­ment for “push­ing ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines with known side ef­fects”, claim­ing that the threat of Covid-19 is “vir­tu­ally zero” and that the disease is un­likely to re­quire “se­ri­ous treat­ment”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bowyer said the au­thor­i­ties should in­stead pro­mote “healthy life­styles, ex­er­cis­ing in the sun, nu­tri­tion and other nat­u­ral im­munesys­tem-boost­ing ac­tiv­i­ties” to pro­tect peo­ple from Covid-19 and fu­ture viruses.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Ms Man­ickam said: “I am alarmed at your re­cent posts on the topic be­cause I stood with you as a can­di­date in Nee Soon GRC... I be­lieve the party has to dis­tance it­self from your dan­ger­ous opin­ions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bowyer has also made two other Face­book posts last week, ques­tion­ing the need to wear masks as a form of pro­tec­tion against Covid-19, as well as the re­li­a­bil­ity of the Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test, which is used to de­tect an in­fec­tion.</p>
