    <p>JERUSALEM • When a 11-year-old school­boy from Gaza posted a video of him­self rap­ping the lyrics of one of his favourite artists, he never ex­pected it would make him fa­mous or get him in trou­ble. It did both.</p>
    <p>The video of Ab­del Rah­man al-Shantti rap­ping in front of his Gaza City school in con­fi­dent English and flaw­less hip-hop at­ti­tude won him more than one mil­lion views and praise from fa­mous rap­pers around the world.</p>
    <p>The trou­ble came when he was asked about his mes­sage. “I would like to spread love be­tween us and Is­rael,” he told an in­ter­viewer from a Rus­sian news out­let. “There’s no rea­son for fight­ing and wars. We need to let this re­la­tion­ship be­come bet­ter and bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The com­ment came un­der fierce crit­i­cism in Gaza, whose lead­er­ship, the mil­i­tant group Ha­mas, ad­vo­cates fight­ing Is­rael to re­take what it sees as Pales­tinian land, not mak­ing peace with it.</p>
    <p>Many Pales­tini­ans lashed out on so­cial me­dia at the bud­ding rap­per and his fa­ther, whom they ac­cused of fail­ing to prop­erly teach his son about the Pales­tinian cause.</p>
    <p>When a young boy “doesn’t study his home­land’s his­tory enough, it’s very easy to plant these ideas in his head”, Mr Saad Yaghi, 23, a res­i­dent of Gaza City, wrote in one typ­i­cal com­ment on Face­book.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian out­let, Rus­sia To­day, re­moved the video at the re­quest of Ab­del Rah­man’s fa­ther, Mr Saleh al-Shantti, who also posted his own video con­tend­ing that his son did not mean peace and love with Is­rael specif­i­cally, but peace with the world.</p>
    <p>“The boy is 11 years old and he mis­spoke,” Mr alShantti said. “He was very tired. It can hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>Ab­del Rah­man said his mu­sic aims to con­vey the suf­fer­ing of Pales­tini­ans in Gaza, whose econ­omy has been dev­as­tated by a block­ade by Is­rael and Egypt, which Is­rael says is to pre­vent Ha­mas from im­port­ing weapons or the means to build them.</p>
    <p>But he also wants to share a mes­sage of peace and equal­ity.</p>
    <p>“You should treat oth­ers as you want to be treated,” he said. “I wish we could stop vi­o­lence and dis­crim­i­na­tion from dif­fer­ent places and dif­fer­ent races.”</p>
