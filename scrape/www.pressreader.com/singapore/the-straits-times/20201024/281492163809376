    <p>Changi Air­port Group (CAG) is look­ing at tak­ing pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures, like putting up net­tings, along a stretch of its new cy­cling track af­ter a woman pedes­trian was hit on the head with a stray ball from an ad­ja­cent golf course.</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent on Thurs­day evening was un­for­tu­nate, it said, adding that it “has never hap­pened” on the new Changi Air­port Con­nec­tor track.</p>
    <p>“CAG is look­ing into ad­di­tional ways to fur­ther min­imise the risk of stray golf balls head­ing to­wards the Juras­sic Mile, such as putting up net­tings in that area,” it added. The track is for cy­clists and pedes­tri­ans.</p>
    <p>Tanah Merah Coun­try Club said it is work­ing with CAG on im­prov­ing the track’s safety fea­tures.</p>
    <p>Both CAG and the coun­try club apol­o­gised for the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The Changi Air­port Con­nec­tor – which in­cludes the 1km Juras­sic Mile stretch with di­nosaur ex­hibits – was opened on Oct 11.</p>
    <p>It stretches from East Coast Park and along­side Tanah Merah Coun­try Club to Ter­mi­nal 4 and Ter­mi­nal 2 at Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>Face­book user Derek Yap wrote in a post on Thurs­day evening that he was walk­ing on the track with his fam­ily and do­mes­tic helper when the ac­ci­dent hap­pened.</p>
    <p>He heard a loud thud, turned and saw his helper drop­ping to her knees. “She held her head and started cry­ing,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>A nearby se­cu­rity of­fi­cer alerted the air­port and an air­port am­bu­lance ar­rived at the scene with a doc­tor, who said the helper had suf­fered bruis­ing and ad­vised that her con­di­tion be mon­i­tored at home, Mr Yap said in his post.</p>
    <p>The helper “is fine so far”. He added: “I am shar­ing this in­ci­dent so that peo­ple are aware. I can’t imag­ine how it (would have) turned out if the golf ball was to hit a child or an el­derly per­son.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has con­tacted CAG and Tanah Merah Coun­try Club to ask why pre­cau­tions, like net­tings, were not put up ini­tially.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, CAG said on Thurs­day that it will resur­face some turns along the con­nec­tor and put up signs warn­ing peo­ple of slip­pery patches.</p>
    <p>The move comes in the wake of Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao re­port­ing that there were sev­eral in­ci­dents of cy­clists slip­ping on turns dur­ing wet weather.</p>
    <p>CAG did not dis­close how many such ac­ci­dents have oc­curred. But it said staff had been de­ployed along the track to en­sure safe dis</p>
    <p>tanc­ing and safety. It had also im­ple­mented speed re­duc­ing strips and painted on the track signs in red alert­ing cy­clists to slow down. It did so be­fore its open­ing.</p>
    <p>Some cy­clists have sug­gested the slip­pery turns could be due to the paint on the track.</p>
    <p>Trans­port in­fra­struc­ture ex­pert Ray­mond Ong from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore said that usu­ally, there are stan­dards to en­sure painted tracks meet a min­i­mum slip re­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Slip­pery turns could also be due to other rea­sons, such as low tyre pres­sure in bi­cy­cles, rain and speed­ing when turn­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>He said cy­clists can re­duce the risk of slip­ping by slow­ing down when turn­ing and en­sur­ing their bi­cy­cles have suf­fi­cient tyre pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Changi Air­port Group said on Thurs­day that it will resur­face some turns along the con­nec­tor and put up signs warn­ing peo­ple of slip­pery patches. The move comes in the wake of Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao re­port­ing that there were sev­eral in­ci­dents of cy­clists slip­ping on turns dur­ing wet weather.</p>
