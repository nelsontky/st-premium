    <p>Aedge Group be­gan trad­ing on the Singapore Ex­change’s Catal­ist board yesterday at 21 cents, one cent or 5 per cent above its ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) price of 20 cents per share.</p>
    <p>It closed flat at 21 cents af­ter some 2.5 mil­lion shares had changed hands.</p>
    <p>The firm – a provider of en­gi­neer­ing, trans­port, se­cu­rity and man­power ser­vices – said last Fri­day evening that all 16 mil­lion place­ment shares in its IPO had been validly sub­scribed for.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion monies re­ceived for th­ese place­ment shares amounted to a to­tal of $3.2 mil­lion as at the close of the place­ment at noon last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Aedge had pre­vi­ously said it was look­ing to raise net pro­ceeds of some $1.7 mil­lion through the IPO, with this place­ment rep­re­sent­ing some 15.1 per cent of the en­larged share cap­i­tal of 106 mil­lion shares of the group.</p>
    <p>Based on the given price, Aedge’s mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion stands at $21.2 mil­lion af­ter the place­ment. This trans­lates to a price-to-earn­ings ra­tio of 59 times.</p>
    <p>Aedge chief ex­ec­u­tive and founder Poh Soon Keng said the ma­jor­ity of the funds raised will be used to fi­nance the ac­qui­si­tion of prop­erty, plant and equip­ment, while the bal­ance will be utilised for work­ing cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>In or­der to “re­main com­pet­i­tive and keep abreast of rapidly chang­ing tech­nolo­gies in se­cu­rity sys­tems”, Aedge also in­tends to de­velop and test new se­cu­rity so­lu­tions in line with mar­ket needs, hire new staff, and up­grade its hu­man re­source soft­ware to sup­port its ex­pand­ing op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The group’s se­cu­rity and man­power ser­vices seg­ment is its big­gest rev­enue con­trib­u­tor. This seg­ment in­cludes se­cu­rity ser­vices such as guard­ing and sys­tem in­te­gra­tion, clean­ing ser­vices, and man­power ser­vices such as sourc­ing and sup­ply­ing aerospace tech­ni­cians to com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Aedge’s trans­port ser­vices busi­ness op­er­ates a fleet of 88 buses that serve routes be­tween nine res­i­den­tial es­tates and the Cen­tral Busi­ness District, as well as school bus ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Although the group’s en­gi­neer­ing ser­vices divi­sion is its small­est rev­enue con­trib­u­tor, Mr Poh said the seg­ment has been grow­ing quickly over the past three years.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic had caused Aedge’s net profit for the 2020 fi­nan­cial year ended June to fall to $400,000 from $1.3 mil­lion a year ago, while rev­enue fell to $23.7 mil­lion from $24.5 mil­lion last year. Net profit mar­gin, too, slipped to 1.8 per cent from 5.1 per cent.</p>
