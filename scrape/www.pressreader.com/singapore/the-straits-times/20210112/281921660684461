        <p>Euro­pean Union gov­ern­ments are cur­rently ab­sorbed with man­ag­ing two big chal­lenges: the roll-out of na­tional vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigns to de­feat the Covid-19 pan­demic, and plan­ning for the eco­nomic revival which must fol­low the cur­rent may­hem. This is not, the con­ven­tional wis­dom sug­gests, the time for grand vi­sions or su­per vi­sion­ar­ies, but for prac­ti­cal strate­gies and good man­agers.</p>
        <p>Yet there is one per­son in Brus­sels who is still free to en­gage in broader think­ing about the fu­ture of the Union: Mr Josep Bor­rell, a for­mer Span­ish for­eign min­is­ter and cur­rently the EU’s for­eign and se­cu­rity pol­icy chief.</p>
        <p>In a re­cently pub­lished ar­ti­cle, Mr Bor­rell said that this year is des­tined to be a land­mark for the con­ti­nent, the key mo­ment when the Euro­pean Union will make a strong come­back on the global stage by pur­su­ing its own “strate­gic au­ton­omy”, namely by ramp­ing up its abil­ity to “safe­guard its cit­i­zens and in­ter­ests in the years and decades ahead”.</p>
        <p>Of course, all Euro­pean of­fi­cials are pro­fes­sional op­ti­mists, and all claim to be guided by vi­sions of a fu­ture which in­vari­ably en­tails more EU pow­ers. And, yes, the con­cept of an EU “strate­gic au­ton­omy” is hardly new; the idea has been bandied about for years.</p>
        <p>How­ever, Mr Bor­rell’s lat­est pro­nounce­ments on this mat­ter do merit be­ing taken more se­ri­ously. For they of­fer some in­ter­est­ing de­tails on what the idea of a Euro­pean strate­gic au­ton­omy means. And the strat­egy Mr Bor­rell seeks to map out is the­o­ret­i­cally achiev­able, raising at least a cred­i­ble prospect of a Union which is not only an eco­nomic gi­ant, but also a se­cu­rity and for­eign pol­icy power to be reck­oned with.</p>
        <p>BREXIT AND TRUMP</p>
        <p>The con­cept of strate­gic au­ton­omy started be­ing used by Euro­pean politi­cians since 2016 for ob­vi­ous rea­sons: Bri­tain’s de­ci­sion to leave the Euro­pean Union and the elec­tion of Mr Don­ald Trump as United States pres­i­dent both hap­pened that year.</p>
        <p>It is im­pos­si­ble to over­es­ti­mate the dev­as­tat­ing im­pact of th­ese two de­vel­op­ments.</p>
        <p>For decades, the EU’s big­gest po­lit­i­cal prob­lem was how to keep coun­tries out of full mem­ber­ship with­out hu­mil­i­at­ing them; at any given mo­ment, there were a hand­ful of na­tions wait­ing to be ad­mit­ted. But here, sud­denly, was a coun­try which chose to leave the Union, an even­tu­al­ity no­body planned for or had any idea how to han­dle.</p>
        <p>And if this was not enough, there was a new pres­i­dent in the White House who not only had zero in­ter­est in main­tain­ing Amer­ica’s special se­cu­rity and trade re­la­tions with Europe, but who also viewed Europe as a strate­gic com­peti­tor, and pro­ceeded to dis­man­tle or at least chal­lenge al­most ev­ery­thing the Euro­peans held dear.</p>
        <p>The only coun­try which was less sur­prised by th­ese de­vel­op­ments was France, for suc­ces­sive French lead­ers since Gen­eral Charles de Gaulle in the early 1960s have ar­gued that Bri­tain will never be a truly com­mit­ted EU mem­ber. And all French lead­ers have spo­ken of their de­sire to see Europe as a dis­tinct power, carv­ing its own niche in the world away from the ri­val­ries be­tween the US and the Soviet Union or, sub­se­quently, Rus­sia and China. As seen from Paris, 2016 was the shock France al­ways ex­pected.</p>
        <p>It was there­fore en­tirely pre­dictable that calls for achiev­ing a Euro­pean strate­gic au­ton­omy should have orig­i­nated in France. And it was equally to be ex­pected that th­ese calls would con­cen­trate on cre­at­ing a truly united Euro­pean mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­ity.</p>
        <p>For this is a log­i­cal con­clu­sion to the in­cre­men­tal ex­pan­sion of co­op­er­a­tion and in­te­gra­tion in three other cen­tral ar­eas: the com­mon trade pol­icy which the EU achieved pro­gres­sively from the 1960s, the Euro­pean po­lit­i­cal co­op­er­a­tion pro­moted since the 1970s, and the more re­cent achieve­ment of en­forc­ing the euro as the sin­gle cur­rency.</p>
        <p>FRANCE’S VI­SION OF A EURO­PEAN MIL­I­TARY</p>
        <p>Europe has the po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic struc­tures, but re­mains a mil­i­tary pygmy, and that has to be rec­ti­fied im­me­di­ately, says France. The ar­gu­ment un­der­lies French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s push for build­ing up Europe as a mil­i­tary power, and was the sub­text of France’s of­fer to create a large mil­i­tary ex­pe­di­tionary force ca­pa­ble of be­ing de­ployed any­where Euro­pean in­ter­ests were threat­ened.</p>
        <p>In the­ory, Mr Macron’s logic is unim­peach­able. Taken to­gether, the 27 EU mem­ber states spend a great deal on their mil­i­taries: no less than a cu­mu­la­tive €223 bil­lion (S$361 bil­lion) a year. But they lack mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties and re­main ut­terly de­pen­dent on the United States for their de­fence. Bri­tain has spent decades block­ing Euro­pean ef­forts to create an EU de­fence struc­ture.</p>
        <p>With Bri­tain out of the way, the mo­ment has ar­rived for Europe to take the ini­tia­tive, not nec­es­sar­ily by in­creas­ing the money it spends on de­fence, but by spend­ing it more ef­fi­ciently and by en­sur­ing that key ca­pa­bil­i­ties re­main in Euro­pean hands.</p>
        <p>Un­for­tu­nately for France, few EU mem­ber states see mat­ters this way. First, many na­tions sus­pect – and usu­ally cor­rectly – that when France talks about a new Euro­pean de­fence iden­tity, it means one run by France and guided by French pri­or­i­ties.</p>
        <p>Sec­ondly, Ger­many – France’s key part­ner on most other EU projects – is deeply re­luc­tant to com­mit it­self to a French vi­sion of a Euro­pean power pro­jec­tion which in­volves the ex­plicit use of mil­i­tary force.</p>
        <p>And then there are the new mem­ber states from cen­tral and east­ern Europe, which re­main de­ter­mined to block any plan to move away from Nato, the US-led mil­i­tary al­liance which has guar­an­teed Euro­pean se­cu­rity since World War II.</p>
        <p>Mr Macron did not help him­self by some­times speak­ing first and only think­ing later. His pub­lic dis­missal of Nato as “brain dead” had the op­po­site ef­fect to that he in­tended; in­stead of invit­ing a dis­cus­sion about the cre­ation of a new EU se­cu­rity struc­ture, it fright­ened many mem­ber states into be­liev­ing that “au­ton­omy” for Europe is syn­ony­mous with a di­vorce from the US.</p>
        <p>And in­stead of ac­cept­ing the east Euro­peans’ fears of Rus­sia as gen­uine, Mr Macron ar­gued that the EU should be get­ting closer to Rus­sia to pre­vent a Rus­sia-China al­liance, a con­cept which stunned many EU lead­ers.</p>
        <p>As a re­sult, most of the grand projects about Euro­pean de­fence re­main just that: ideas con­tained in French pres­i­den­tial speeches, usu­ally de­liv­ered in the gilded halls of some French uni­ver­sity, and promptly set aside.</p>
        <p>That is not to say that noth­ing was done. The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion – the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive body – now has a pot of cash of around €500 mil­lion for Europe-spe­cific de­fence re­search. And the bud­get the EU al­lo­cates for de­fence projects be­tween now and 2027 stands at €7 bil­lion. There is also stronger co­or­di­na­tion be­tween dif­fer­ent Euro­pean de­fence min­istries and in­tel­li­gence ser­vices. But none of this even gets near to what Pres­i­dent Macron ini­tially en­vis­aged.</p>
        <p>In ret­ro­spect, the de­bate about Euro­pean “au­ton­omy” was not helped by its con­cen­tra­tion purely on mil­i­tary mat­ters. For th­ese are by no means the only miss­ing parts of a Europe which can act on the global stage.</p>
        <p>FIX­ING SUP­PLY CHAIN DE­PEN­DENCE</p>
        <p>As Mr Bor­rell ar­gues, the past year and, es­pe­cially, the Covid-19 pan­demic have il­lus­trated many other vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties which Europe should ad­dress. Chief among th­ese is the con­ti­nent’s re­liance on sup­ply chains it does not con­trol, such as the pro­duc­tion of generic medicines and med­i­cal equip­ment, but also the sup­ply of raw ma­te­ri­als and key tech­nolo­gies.</p>
        <p>“We have learnt the hard way,” says Mr Bor­rell in a clear ref­er­ence to China, “that there are costs to de­pend­ing on just a few sup­pli­ers of crit­i­cal goods – es­pe­cially when the sup­plier is a coun­try whose value sys­tem is fun­da­men­tally at odds with our own.”</p>
        <p>Strate­gic au­ton­omy, Mr Bor­rell adds, “is about how Europe can ad­dress vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties across a wide range of ar­eas – from crit­i­cal tech­nolo­gies and in­fra­struc­ture (such as digital net­works and cloud com­put­ing) to rare earths and the raw ma­te­ri­als needed for the green tran­si­tion”. The point, he adds, “is not to em­brace au­tarky or pro­tec­tion­ism, but to safe­guard our po­lit­i­cal in­de­pen­dence so that we re­main masters of our own choices and fu­ture.”</p>
        <p>And on that, expect the Euro­pean Union to make progress, partly be­cause such ob­jec­tives are shared by most, if not all, EU mem­ber states, but also be­cause th­ese are ar­eas where the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion al­ready has pow­ers to act and some of the nec­es­sary re­sources.</p>
        <p>Many of th­ese tasks are not as glam­orous as that of es­tab­lish­ing Euro­pean mil­i­tary units with splen­did blue uni­forms. But some could be even more con­se­quen­tial.</p>
        <p>To use just one ex­am­ple, more than 180 Euro­pean tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies have just an­nounced that they will be par­tic­i­pat­ing in the Euro­pean Gaia-X cloud project which aims to create a “se­cure and trust­wor­thy data in­fra­struc­ture for Europe” so that the con­ti­nent will not be ut­terly de­pen­dent on US tech gi­ants such as Ama­zon, Mi­crosoft or Google. France, Italy and Spain are al­ready on board, and many oth­ers are cer­tain to join as well.</p>
        <p>Mean­while, the con­ti­nent is buzzing with other projects to diver­sify de­pen­dence on sin­gle sup­pli­ers of any prod­uct or raw ma­te­rial, and to recre­ate na­tional pro­duc­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties for crit­i­cal sec­tors such as medicines and health equip­ment.</p>
        <p>“We have wit­nessed the weapon­i­sa­tion of in­ter­de­pen­dence,” Mr Bor­rell warns. “Trade, tech­nol­ogy, in­vest­ment, tourism and other for­mer venues of deep­en­ing co­op­er­a­tion have be­come in­stru­ments of power and do­mains of in­tense com­pe­ti­tion,” he says, and Europe must con­tend with them.</p>
        <p>WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE</p>
        <p>There are many pit­falls on the way.</p>
        <p>Adopt­ing poli­cies which de­fend key na­tional in­dus­tries while avoid­ing trade pro­tec­tion­ism or trade dis­putes with both the US and China is eas­ier said than done.</p>
        <p>EU gov­ern­ments also do not have an un­blem­ished record of spon­sor­ing the right tech­nolo­gies, so plans to create an EU au­tonomous data in­fra­struc­ture may come to naught.</p>
        <p>It is also not enough to sim­ply wish to be au­tonomous of both the US and China, so the Euro­peans will have to come up with a bet­ter ex­pla­na­tion as to what in­de­pen­dence means in the world.</p>
        <p>And although with the Bri­tish de­par­ture, the EU has un­doubt­edly gained in po­lit­i­cal co­he­sion, it has also lost geopo­lit­i­cal weight be­cause the Bri­tish re­main one of only two sig­nif­i­cant Euro­pean mil­i­tary pow­ers. So, an ar­range­ment be­tween the EU and Bri­tain will have to be forged, if the en­tire idea of an EU au­tonomous ex­is­tence is to be­come more cred­i­ble.</p>
        <p>Yet there is no doubt that af­ter years of rather aca­demic de­bates about au­ton­omy, the EU mem­ber states are at least stum­bling on prac­ti­cal and con­struc­tive steps.</p>
        <p>For once, Mr Bor­rell may be right when he pre­dicts that Europe could “learn to speak the lan­guage of power”.</p>
