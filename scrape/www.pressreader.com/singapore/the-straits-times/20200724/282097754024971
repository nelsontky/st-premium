    <p>Ser­vice buy­ers should not ask for re­duced con­tract fees on the ba­sis that their providers are re­ceiv­ing wage sub­si­dies through the en­hanced Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS), the Man­power and Fi­nance min­istries have said.</p>
    <p>JSS pay­outs, which sub­sidise lo­cal work­ers’ wages, have sparked ten­sion be­tween prop­erty man­age­ment coun­cils and man­ag­ing agents (MAs).</p>
    <p>Sev­eral let­ters to The Straits Times Fo­rum have called for MAs to pass on re­bates to man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tions, or MCSTs. They noted that MAs are still be­ing paid their fees, which in­clude a com­po­nent for the salaries of staff de­ployed at con­do­minium sites.</p>
    <p>MCST coun­cil mem­ber An­ge­line Koh wrote that man­ag­ing agents ap­pear to be “en­joy­ing a wind­fall”.</p>
    <p>She told the ST that if, for in­stance, staff are paid $2,000 a month, the to­tal amount in JSS pay­outs MAs would get over the 10 months of the scheme would ex­ceed $20 mil­lion, yet they are be­ing fully re­im­bursed for the di­rect cost of the staff by the MCST.</p>
    <p>The cal­cu­la­tion as­sumes one em­ployee per MCST but big­ger prop­er­ties can have two or three on site.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has about 3,500 ac­tive MCSTs.</p>
    <p>Mr Fan Jia Ming, who is on the man­age­ment coun­cils of Ox­ley Tow­ers and Pav­il­ion Square, said MCSTs pay a monthly fee that in­cludes the MA staff salaries. If the MCST cuts head­count by one, that em­ployee would most likely be laid off un­less re­de­ployed else­where.</p>
    <p>“In this re­spect, the end-em­ployer is in essence the MCST, even though legally the staff (mem­ber) is em­ployed by the MA, and it’s the MCST’s de­ci­sion to keep some­one em­ployed,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Jethro Wid­jaja, who helps his brother with man­age­ment coun­cil oper­a­tions at Thom­son Grand, said MAs are con­tracted by MCSTs on an an­nual ba­sis and need monthly pay­ments, so many MCSTs have not been able to lower their monthly fees even though the man­power supplied may have been re­duced dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Man­age­ment coun­cil mem­bers said MA fees can be $16,000 to $20,000 for a condo with three em­ploy­ees. But MAs say that pass­ing on JSS pay­outs would not ful­fil the in­tent of the scheme, which is to pro­tect jobs.</p>
    <p>The As­so­ci­a­tion of Strata Man­agers said the MA has to bear costs such as stay-at-home leave for em­ploy­ees who re­turn from over­seas and other li­a­bil­i­ties dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, while salary cuts for se­nior ex­ec­u­tives, in­clud­ing no­pay leave, have been im­ple­mented to pre­vent re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>“If the JSS is passed on to the man­age­ment coun­cil, is this not a wind­fall for them since they do not have any em­ploy­ees? Should the con­sumer now ask all busi­nesses to re­duce their prices be­cause of the JSS since the prices con­tain an el­e­ment of staff cost?” it said.</p>
    <p>The As­so­ci­a­tion of Prop­erty and Fa­cil­ity Man­agers noted that MA staff have been step­ping up clean­ing and dis­in­fect­ing of com­mon ar­eas in con­dos and en­forc­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“MAs are work­ing to­wards keep­ing the res­i­dents safe, with many stretch­ing their re­sources thin, as they work longer hours to pro­vide es­sen­tial ser­vices to res­i­dents now work­ing from homes,” it said.</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and Min­istry of Fi­nance spokesmen said the pay­outs to out­sourced ser­vice providers help them meet their obli­ga­tions to work­ers, even when their busi­nesses are af­fected.</p>
    <p>“Typ­i­cally, ser­vice buy­ers do not have di­rect say over the em­ploy­ment and de­ploy­ment of spe­cific work­ers. As the key de­ci­sion on worker em­ploy­ment rests with the out­sourced ven­dor, the JSS pay­out should be re­tained by the ven­dors to sup­port em­ploy­ment,” they said.</p>
    <p>“Ser­vice buy­ers should not ask for re­duced con­tract fees on the ba­sis that their ser­vice providers are re­ceiv­ing wage sup­port through the en­hanced JSS as its pro­vi­sion is tem­po­rary in na­ture.”</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress and sev­eral in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tions and union lead­ers told man­age­ment coun­cils on May 22 that it is “im­per­a­tive” they do not pres­sure ser­vice providers to re­duce con­tract fees with­out ad­just­ing ex­pec­ta­tions and de­liv­er­ables on their part.</p>
    <p>An MOM ad­vi­sory is­sued on May 26 and up­dated on June 12 says that labour sup­ply com­pa­nies should pass on JSS pay­outs to clients, but this does not ap­ply to providers of­fer­ing out­sourced ser­vices such as clean­ing and MA ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Labour sup­ply firms in­clude em­ploy­ment agen­cies whose staff are con­tracted out to work for clients.</p>
    <p>Out­sourced ser­vice providers, in con­trast, are re­spon­si­ble for the day-to-day man­age­ment of the con­tracted work­ers such as su­per­vis­ing them, ap­praisals and train­ing, says the ad­vi­sory.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral man­ag­ing agents the ST con­tacted – Knight Frank, Col­liers In­ter­na­tional, Cush­man & Wake­field and JLL – de­clined to com­ment on whether they are pro­vid­ing re­bates to MCST clients.</p>
    <p>But Sav­ills Prop­erty Man­age­ment is of­fer­ing some re­bates on man­ag­ing agent fees to MCST clients.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan Kok Hong, its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, said Sav­ills man­ages 140 build­ings but de­clined to pro­vide de­tails on the re­bate.</p>
    <p>“The re­bates are given as a good­will ges­ture and in ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the good busi­ness re­la­tion­ship that we have with our clients,” he said.</p>
