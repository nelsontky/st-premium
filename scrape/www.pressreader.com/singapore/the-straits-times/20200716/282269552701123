    <p>Malaysia’s big­gest air­line AirAsia should be able to weather its cur­rent fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties, say an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Au­di­tors have warned that its fu­ture is in “sig­nif­i­cant doubt”, with flights largely crip­pled by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>AirAsia – which also op­er­ates in five other Asian coun­tries and has been voted the top low-cost air­line in the world 11 times – has ad­mit­ted that it is fac­ing its big­gest chal­lenge in 19 years since group chief ex­ec­u­tive Tony Fer­nan­des bought the com­pany for a nom­i­nal sum of RM1.</p>
    <p>The com­pany needs to raise close to RM2 bil­lion (S$652 mil­lion) over the next year to turn its for­tunes around, a tar­get Mr Fer­nan­des is con­fi­dent of reach­ing.</p>
    <p>In a re­port last week, Af­fin Hwang Cap­i­tal an­a­lyst Isaac Chow said that he ex­pects AirAsia to con­tinue run­ning its busi­ness as a go­ing con­cern, with a boost to liq­uid­ity from new loans and the rais­ing of eq­uity.</p>
    <p>“None­the­less, the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment re­mains very chal­leng­ing and we ex­pect AirAsia to con­tinue re­port­ing losses in the com­ing quar­ters,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>CSG CIMB an­a­lyst Ray­mond Yap was also “rea­son­ably con­fi­dent” that the car­rier would sur­vive the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing AirAsia’s as­sur­ances at face value, we are rea­son­ably con­fi­dent that the car­rier will sur­vive Covid-19,” Mr Yap said last week.</p>
    <p>He said that a po­ten­tial RM1 bil­lion loan to its lo­cal op­er­a­tions, other loans to its other Asian op­er­a­tions, and an eq­uity is­sue will be able to raise close to RM3 bil­lion needed to keep the air­line afloat.</p>
    <p>An un­qual­i­fied au­dit opin­ion state­ment by Ernst & Young last week said that the car­rier’s li­a­bil­i­ties ex­ceeded its as­sets by RM1.84 bil­lion. The au­dit opin­ion came days af­ter the air­line an­nounced a record quar­terly loss of RM803.8 mil­lion fol­low­ing the ground­ing of most of its fleet in March.</p>
    <p>AirAsia shares plunged 18 per cent fol­low­ing the au­dit state­ment, and the air­line sub­se­quently said that the share plunge trig­gered the req­ui­sites for a Prac­tice Note 17 (PN17), which ap­plies to fi­nan­cially dis­tressed com­pa­nies on the Malaysian stock ex­change. But the car­rier will not be clas­si­fied as a PN17 com­pany be­cause of the gov­ern­ment’s on­go­ing re­lief mea­sures over the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­nan­des says the com­pany con­tin­ues to have strong cash flow.</p>
    <p>AirAsia had a net cash po­si­tion of RM2.1 bil­lion at the end of 2019, de­spite post­ing a RM286 mil­lion loss for the same year.</p>
    <p>The air­line, which posted a RM1.7 bil­lion profit at the end of 2018, said that the loss was partly due to ac­count­ing treat­ment af­ter it re­struc­tured its air­craft own­er­ship – chang­ing from own­ing to leas­ing its air­craft, and other mea­sures fol­low­ing its adop­tion of the Malaysian Fi­nan­cial Re­port­ing Stan­dards (MFRS) 16.</p>
    <p>But a cash burn rate of RM120 mil­lion monthly – mostly due to the ground­ing of its fleet – led to the com­pany seek­ing to raise funds even be­fore the au­di­tor’s state­ment.</p>
    <p>“I won’t run a com­pany based on an au­dit re­port,” Mr Fer­nan­des said dur­ing an in­ter­view with busi­ness ra­dio sta­tion BFM last week. “We have been work­ing on this (find­ing in­vestors and rais­ing funds) since</p>
    <p>March. We are in the process of rais­ing debt and eq­uity. Our cash flow is still very strong.”</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Shukor Yu­sof from En­dau An­a­lyt­ics last week also said that he be­lieves that the air­line will weather the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“I see them be­ing able to over­come this. There is a fair chance of them ob­tain­ing the funds,” Mr Shukor said dur­ing an in­ter­view with BFM, point­ing to the air­line’s im­por­tance to the Malaysian econ­omy and its mar­ket leader po­si­tion in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Last month, South Korea’s third big­gest con­glom­er­ate SK Group said that it is con­sid­er­ing tak­ing a 10 per cent stake in the air­line, which will raise RM334.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The air­line has said that it plans to raise RM1 bil­lion from fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and RM1.4 bil­lion more via eq­ui­ties.</p>
