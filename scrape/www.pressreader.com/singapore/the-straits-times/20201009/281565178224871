    <p>Stu­dent ath­letes and their par­ents are look­ing for­ward to the re­turn of the Na­tional School Games (NSG) next year, af­ter the an­nual con­test was axed in May ow­ing to Covid-19. The Min­istry of Education said that the ac­tiv­i­ties would re­sume with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>Since the Na­tional School Games (NSG) were axed in May ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic, Kem­ing Pri­mary School floor­baller Durga Devi Vik­nesyaran has spent the past few months bug­ging her teacher-in-charge and search­ing the In­ter­net for up­dates on the sta­tus of the NSG.</p>
    <p>When the Min­istry of Education (MOE) an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that the NSG would be back next year, 11-year-old Durga – and many other stu­dent-ath­letes like her – was de­lighted to hear the news.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be spe­cial be­cause I haven’t played a match in so long,” said Durga, who will be sit­ting the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion next year. “I’m very mo­ti­vated be­cause this year, we couldn’t play so I want to be cham­pi­ons next year.”</p>
    <p>The news was also wel­comed by soft­baller Nur Aliya Nata­sya, who is a Sec­ondary 3 stu­dent at Pe­icai Sec­ondary School.</p>
    <p>Nata­sya, 15, said: “I felt very happy be­cause next year will be my last year in the school. It was sad (when the NSG was can­celled) be­cause we ded­i­cated our time and ef­fort to train­ing, but ev­ery­thing was gone.”</p>
    <p>In its an­nounce­ment on Wed­nes­day, MOE said that more de­tails on the re­sump­tion of the NSG will be avail­able at a later date, adding that the ac­tiv­i­ties will re­sume with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>More school and co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties will be al­lowed to re­sume from the mid­dle of this month, af­ter the year-end ex­am­i­na­tions for pri­mary and sec­ondary schools, as well as ju­nior col­leges.</p>
    <p>With Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally eas­ing Covid-19 re­stric­tions in re­cent months, par­ents of the stu­dent-ath­letes were also happy to hear about the NSG’s re­turn next year, as long as there are pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>The an­nual sports com­pe­ti­tion sees about 60,000 stu­dent-ath­letes com­pet­ing across 29 sports.</p>
    <p>Durga’s mother, Anan­thi Kan­dasamy, ad­mit­ted that she ini­tially had con­cerns when stu­dents were al­lowed to re­turn to school in early June, but see­ing how things were han­dled has re­as­sured her that the NSG can restart safely.</p>
    <p>Home­maker May Ng, 50, whose son Josiah plays squash, said: “Things are pretty calm in Sin­ga­pore so it’s good that the kids can start par­tic­i­pat­ing next year.</p>
    <p>“We have to live with the new nor­mal, we don’t know how long this (coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion) will last.”</p>
    <p>IT pro­fes­sional Michael Teoh, whose two sons Ju­lian and Ethan play floor­ball, be­lieves that it will be good for his chil­dren to start com­pet­ing again af­ter months of prac­tis­ing drills at home.</p>
    <p>Teoh, 51, said: “When they open up, I be­lieve they’ll be more strin­gent in terms of mak­ing sure that play­ers get their tem­per­a­ture checked, they’re healthy be­fore they take part and prob­a­bly (hold­ing the NSG) with­out spec­ta­tors, but at least that will give the kids an op­por­tu­nity to play.”</p>
    <p>His home­maker wife Lau Joo Meng pro­posed more sub­sti­tu­tions in floor­ball games so play­ers spend less time on court, thereby min­imis­ing phys­i­cal con­tact.</p>
    <p>Foot­ball coach To­hari Pai­jan, 62, urged the au­thor­i­ties to take it slow, rec­om­mend­ing that they start with small pi­lots such as in­ter­class games be­fore pro­gress­ing to friendlies be­tween smaller groups of play­ers to en­sure the safety of stu­dent-ath­letes.</p>
    <p>To­hari, who coaches Angsana Pri­mary School and Te­masek Ju­nior Col­lege, said: “I care about the play­ers’ wel­fare and don’t want them to be sick. We must see if it’s safe first and mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
