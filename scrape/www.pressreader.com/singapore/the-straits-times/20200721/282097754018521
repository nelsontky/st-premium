    <p>Ms Lee Yu Hui’s hot pink in­fo­graph­ics ded­i­cated to Bar­bie turned heads at the an­nual So­ci­ety for News De­sign (SND) com­pe­ti­tion, which hands out awards known as the de­sign Os­cars of the me­dia in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Her work, which traces the ori­gins of the world’s most fa­mous doll, took weeks to com­plete.</p>
    <p>To mark Bar­bie’s 60th birthday, Ms Lee was tasked to fea­ture the most iconic it­er­a­tions of the doll. She even­tu­ally picked 23 out of more than 200 ver­sions.</p>
    <p>“I fell down a rab­bit hole while do­ing re­search to de­cide which dolls I should pick for the fi­nal ver­sion of the graph­ics,” the 26-year-old said.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee’s in­fo­graph­ics was one of five wins The Straits Times (ST) notched up for news de­sign, in­for­ma­tion graph­ics and il­lus­tra­tions at the 41st edi­tion of the SND’s Best of News De­sign cre­ative com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion saw judges at St Peters­burg, Florida, re­view­ing about 4,000 global en­tries in 20 cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>All five ST wins were awards of ex­cel­lence which hon­our “dar­ing and in­no­va­tive” work, said SND – which is based in the United States – on its web­site.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee was also part of the team, to­gether with Mr Si­mon Ang, 55, Mr Bryandt Lyn, 32, and Mr Billy Ker, 32, be­hind the in­fo­graph­ics, The Marvel Cin­e­matic Uni­verse: The story so far...</p>
    <p>The in­fo­graph­ics had also clinched a sil­ver award in this year’s Asian Me­dia Awards or­gan­ised by the World As­so­ci­a­tion of News­pa­pers and News Pub­lish­ers (Wan-Ifra).</p>
    <p>“This is the first time an ST in­fo­graph­ics has won in both com­pe­ti­tions, which are big names in the in­dus­try,” said Mr Ang, who is the pa­per’s vis­ual and in­fo­graph­ics deputy ed­i­tor.</p>
    <p>An­other award went to se­nior ex­ec­u­tive artist Miel Pru­den­cio for his cre­ation on his ad­ven­tures at the Venice Bi­en­nale 2019. The sights and sound of Venice came alive in his illustrati­on, which he cre­ated by com­bin­ing ink and dig­i­tal draw­ings with a pho­to­graph he took of a street drawing by a canal.</p>
    <p>On why he chose to fo­cus on Venice – which he vis­ited in July last year – for his illustrati­on, Miel, 56, said: “Venice it­self is like a big mu­seum. The churches alone, its ar­chi­tec­ture and what’s housed in­side – the paint­ings and sculp­tures – are a tes­ta­ment to the cul­tural and his­tor­i­cal grav­i­tas of this city.”</p>
    <p>The two other awards ST took home were in the News De­sign cat­e­gory. The first went to ex­ec­u­tive sube­d­i­tor T. Ra­jan, 47, for his work on the story Weav­ing to­gether tales of de­men­tia, and the sec­ond to ex­ec­u­tive sub-ed­i­tor Ade­line Chua, 39, and se­nior ex­ec­u­tive in­fo­graph­ics jour­nal­ist Chng Choon Hiong, 43, for their con­tri­bu­tions to a story on on­line shop­ping.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jan, 47, said: “De­men­tia is now af­fect­ing more and more Sin­ga­pore­ans, and I’m glad that we at The Straits Times got the op­por­tu­nity to shine a light on the is­sue, and some of the things that are be­ing done to help those suf­fer­ing from the ill­ness.”</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on his win with Ms Chua, Mr Chng said: “I did the graph­ics in an iso­met­ric style which you of­ten find in video games, so that read­ers can fol­low the jour­ney of their par­cel in a fun and easy way.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Ade­line and I then worked to­gether on lay­ing out the page so that the ac­com­pa­ny­ing story is har­mo­niously in­te­grated with the vi­su­als.”</p>
    <p>Straits Times as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Lim Chuan Huat said: “The awards at­test to the qual­ity of work pro­duced by our artists and de­sign­ers. Their ex­cel­lence re­mains a bright spot amid the chal­leng­ing pan­demic en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 13 gold medals, 61 sil­ver medals, two judges’ spe­cial recog­ni­tion, and 920 awards of ex­cel­lence were awarded by the SND this year. All win­ners will re­ceive cer­tifi­cates in recog­ni­tion of their work.</p>
