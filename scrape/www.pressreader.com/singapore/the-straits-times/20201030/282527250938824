    <p>The for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of main­board-listed KTL Global, Wil­son Tan Kheng Yeow, was charged in the State Courts yes­ter­day with cheat­ing and false trad­ing be­tween 2014 and 2015.</p>
    <p>Charge sheets seen by The Busi­ness Times show Tan had on two oc­ca­sions al­legedly cheated KTL Global’s wholly owned sub­sidiary KTL Off­shore of a to­tal of around $1.5 mil­lion to fund trades in the shares of KTL Global.</p>
    <p>Tan faces two cheat­ing charges, pun­ish­able un­der Sec­tion 420 of the Pe­nal Code. He was also slapped with one charge of false trad­ing un­der Sec­tion 197(1A)(a) of the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act (SFA).</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2017, KTL Global said Tan was as­sist­ing with the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment and the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore in in­ves­ti­ga­tions con­cern­ing a pos­si­ble of­fence un­der the SFA. Tan sur­ren­dered his pass­port to the au­thor­i­ties and re­signed as CEO.</p>
    <p>He is ac­cused of de­ceiv­ing KTL Off­shore by rep­re­sent­ing that a $1.5 mil­lion re­mit­tance to KTL Global’s as­so­ciate com­pany FW Coastal Ven­tures on Nov 4, 2014 was for FW’s work­ing cap­i­tal pur­poses. But he had planned to use $500,000 of that re­mit­tance amount to fund trades in KTL Global.</p>
    <p>From April 23 to May 5, 2015, Tan al­legedly de­ceived KTL Off­shore on about $1 mil­lion to be trans­ferred to KTL Off­shore Hong Kong to buy ma­chin­ery on be­half of KTL Off­shore Tech­nol­ogy (Nan­tong), which was 40 per cent-owned by KTL Global.</p>
    <p>It is said that Tan in­tended to route the $1 mil­lion from the Hong Kong firm to In­fin­ity Global Con­sul­tancy, which is solely owned and con­trolled by Mr Tang Boon Hai.</p>
    <p>An­other charge sheet states that Tan con­spired with Mr Tang to give a false or mis­lead­ing im­pres­sion that there was ac­tive trad­ing in shares of KTL Global be­tween Oc­to­ber 2014 and Septem­ber 2015.</p>
    <p>Mr Tang is said to have used 14 trad­ing ac­counts to buy 122.8 mil­lion shares and sell 120.7 mil­lion shares from Nov 4, 2014 to Sept 8, 2015. This led to the stock’s av­er­age daily traded vol­ume surg­ing to about one mil­lion shares dur­ing that pe­riod, up from about 96,859 shares over the pre­vi­ous six months.</p>
    <p>To do this, Mr Tang also al­legedly in­structed a for­mer trad­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tive from OCBC Se­cu­ri­ties, Tan Chun Yong, to place or­ders and trades in the stock us­ing six ac­counts which be­longed to other in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Tan Chun Yong was charged yes­ter­day with abet­ment by in­ter­na­tion­ally aid­ing Mr Tang to cre­ate a false or mis­lead­ing ap­pear­ance of ac­tive trad­ing in KTL Global’s shares, un­der Sec­tion 197(1)(a) of the SFA.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the charge sheets, OCBC was not in­formed of and did not con­sent to Tan Chun Yong’s use of the six ac­counts. He was thus also slapped with six charges un­der Sec­tion 201(b) of the SFA.</p>
    <p>Wil­son Tan was of­fered bail of $100,000 while Tan Chun Yong’s bail was set at $35,000.</p>
    <p>The court ad­journed their cases to Nov 26 and Nov 19 re­spec­tively for fur­ther men­tion.</p>
    <p>He (Wil­son Tan Kheng Yeow) is ac­cused of de­ceiv­ing KTL Off­shore by rep­re­sent­ing that a $1.5 mil­lion re­mit­tance to KTL Global’s as­so­ciate com­pany FW Coastal Ven­tures on Nov 4, 2014 was for FW’s work­ing cap­i­tal pur­poses. But he had planned to use $500,000 of that re­mit­tance amount to fund trades in KTL Global.</p>
