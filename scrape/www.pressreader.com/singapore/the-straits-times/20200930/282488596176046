    <p>LON­DON • One morn­ing in March, not long after the coro­n­avirus sent her coun­try i nto l ock­down and brought an abrupt end to life as she had known it, Mrs Hazell Jacobs, 86, awoke in her south Lon­don home ready to start some­thing new.</p>
    <p>For weeks, Mrs Jacobs, a widow liv­ing alone, had ven­tured no far­ther than her gar­den. Benev­o­lent neigh­bours brought her gro­ceries and she had reg­u­lar phone check­ins from her daugh­ters and grand­chil­dren, but a mi­nor stroke weeks ear­lier had sent her into lock­down be­fore most, and a chronic eye con­di­tion was erod­ing her sight.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter. She opened a closet and be­gan pulling out a col­lec­tion of scarves – hundreds of them, gath­ered over decades of trav­els around the world.</p>
    <p>There were count­less me­mories stitched into their hems, each silky ex­panse a story wait­ing to be told.</p>
    <p>Mrs Jacobs sat down and be­gan to write what soon be­came Scarf Aid, a blog Mrs Jacobs has faith­fully main­tained since March 26.</p>
    <p>From the start­ing point of a char­ity shop shawl or vin­tage Her­mes wrap­per, each en­try weaves memoir, es­say, history and travelogue in the un­self-con­scious style of early In­ter­net writ­ing, while ra­di­at­ing the Keep Calm And Carry On en­ergy of a de­cid­edly Bri­tish pep talk.</p>
    <p>The posts dance across nearly 90 years of me­mories: her child­hood in Brechin, Scot­land, stints liv­ing in Hong Kong and Cal­i­for­nia dur­ing her hus­band’s ca­reer as a l and sur­veyor, her trav­els around the world and out­ings closer to home.</p>
    <p>Mrs Jacobs is a doer by na­ture – she gar­dens and is teach­ing her­self Ital­ian. She is also the type to seek out those in need of her help.</p>
    <p>For sev­eral years, she was a sui­cide hot­line vol­un­teer. She knew that many of her read­ers were older adults, many with­out the ad­van­tages of rel­a­tive good health and a sup­port­ive lo­cal network. Even some of her clos­est friends were strug­gling un­der the weight of iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“I’m used to sup­port­ing oth­ers,” she said. “So, I thought, that’ll be my role, to cheer peo­ple up,” not­ing that a lot her friends have felt down.</p>
    <p>For many older peo­ple around the world, the pan­demic has cast a shadow over their lives. Vis­its with friends and fam­ily are dis­tanced, if they can hap­pen at all. A trip to the doc­tor or gro­cery store can feel like a threat. Fa­tal­ity rates for Covid-19 pa­tients over the age of 70 are far higher t han those of younger pa­tients. To pro­tect them­selves, a pop­u­la­tion that al­ready grap­pled dis­pro­por­tion­ately with lone­li­ness has had to re­treat even fur­ther into iso­la­tion, which can lead to de­pres­sion and worse health out­comes.</p>
    <p>“We have un­der­es­ti­mated the importance of con­nect­ed­ness,” said Dr John Rowe, a pro­fes­sor of health pol­icy and age­ing at the Mail­man School of Public Health at Columbia Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Dr Rowe made the ob­ser­va­tion on Sept 17, dur­ing an on­line panel on age­ing and the pan­demic or­gan­ised by the Stan­ford Cen­tre on Longevity.</p>
    <p>The preva­lence of lone­li­ness among older adults, par­tic­u­larly in high-in­come coun­tries such as the United States and Bri­tain, was a prob­lem be­fore the health cri­sis and has only wors­ened since.</p>
    <p>In one sur­vey of US adults aged 50 and older, 69 per cent of re­spon­dents said they were self-iso­lat­ing or quar­an­tined as a re­sult of the virus, ac­cord­ing to the Amer­i­can As­so­ci­a­tion of Re­tired Per­sons. Nearly half of the re­spon­dents said they felt lonely at least some of the time.</p>
    <p>But the re­sults showed an in­ter­est­ing trend.</p>
    <p>The older the re­spon­dents, the less likely they were to re­port feel­ing iso­lated, de­pressed or left out. Roughly 73 per cent of adults 65 or older said they never felt left out of things, but only 58 per cent of adults in the younger bracket felt the same.</p>
    <p>About 50 per cent of adults ages 50 to 64 said they some­times felt lonely, but only 42 per cent of adults over 65 did.</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral pos­si­ble rea­sons for this: Adults ages 50 to 64 are more likely to still be work­ing while also car­ing for de­pen­dent chil­dren and age­ing par­ents, and this can lead to higher stress lev­els.</p>
    <p>It is also pos­si­ble that the same re­silience that helps peo­ple live a longer life helps them ward off lone­li­ness and its neg­a­tive health ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Older women who have fared best in the pan­demic tend to have many of the same re­sources Mrs Jacobs does: ac­cess to hous­ing, food and healthcare; the sup­port of fam­ily and friends; and a sense of pur­pose that gives shape to the days.</p>
    <p>It is a use­ful re­minder of what makes the dif­fer­ence be­tween soli­tude and lone­li­ness, and the ef­fect that con­nec­tions, even dis­tanced ones, have on well-be­ing.</p>
