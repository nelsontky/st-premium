    <p>MOSCOW • Ig­nor­ing pleas from the Krem­lin for calm after more than a week of un­rest, protesters in Rus­sia’s far east last Satur­day staged their big­gest dis­play of de­fi­ance yet, with tens of thou­sands of peo­ple pour­ing into the streets to protest against the ar­rest of a pop­u­lar re­gional gov­er­nor.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian me­dia re­ported that about 50,000 peo­ple had joined a rally in the cap­i­tal of Khabarovsk Krai, a sprawl­ing ter­ri­tory nearly 6,400km east of Moscow.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands more at­tended demon­stra­tions in other re­gional towns and in Vladi­vos­tok, a ma­jor Pa­cific port city in the neigh­bour­ing Pri­morsky Krai.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment in Khabarovsk, the re­gional cap­i­tal, said in a state­ment that only 10,000 peo­ple had gath­ered “at the be­gin­ning” but gave no fig­ure for the over­all turnout.</p>
    <p>Po­lice of­fi­cers in Khabarovsk made no ef­fort to stop what the au­thor­i­ties de­scribed as an “il­le­gal” but peace­ful protest and in­stead handed out face masks. In Vladi­vos­tok, how­ever, a num­ber of ar­rests were re­ported.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tions be­gan after the ar­rest on July 9 on mur­der charges of Khabarovsk’s Gov­er­nor Sergei Fur­gal, one of a hand­ful of re­gional lead­ers not af­fil­i­ated with a party en­tirely con­trolled by the Krem­lin.</p>
    <p>Protesters car­ried slo­gans de­mand­ing the re­lease of Fur­gal, ac­cord­ing to footage posted on so­cial me­dia. The in­de­pen­dent Ekho Moskvy ra­dio es­ti­mated that 20,000 peo­ple had joined the un­sanc­tioned protest.</p>
    <p>Po­lice de­tained Fur­gal ear­lier this month on al­le­ga­tions that he or­gan­ised sev­eral mur­ders i n 2004-2005. He de­nies the ac­cu­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>In­stead of be­ing held in Khabarovsk, where the au­thor­i­ties al­lege the crimes took place, Fur­gal was flown to Moscow im­me­di­ately after his ar­rest, a move seen by many lo­cals as an un­war­ranted in­tru­sion into their af­fairs and an ef­fort by the Krem­lin to grab con­trol of the case.</p>
    <p>The case has crys­tallised long­stand­ing re­sent­ments in Rus­sia’s far-flung re­gions to­wards Moscow, which is of­ten seen as de­mand­ing loy­alty while giv­ing lit­tle in re­turn.</p>
    <p>In a blow to lo­cal pride, the Krem­lin re­sponded to Fur­gal’s elec­tion vic­tory in 2018 over its own can­di­date by re­jig­ger­ing bu­reau­cratic bound­aries in the far eastern re­gions to give pri­macy to Vladi­vos­tok, Khabarovsk’s long-time ri­val.</p>
    <p>Fur­gal is a mem­ber of the Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party, a far-right out­fit that has grown in­creas­ingly restive over its Krem­lin-as­signed role as a largely pow­er­less “op­po­si­tion” party in Rus­sia’s tightly con­trolled po­lit­i­cal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor’s pros­e­cu­tion comes amid a series of moves by se­cu­rity forces against op­po­nents of Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin since he won a crush­ing en­dorse­ment of his right to ex­tend his rule un­til 2036 in a con­sti­tu­tional vote on July 1 that ob­servers said was marred by ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
