    <p>The fu­ture of Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion shows about po­lice of­fi­cers con­tin­ues to look un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>This in the wake of the killing of black civil­ian Ge­orge Floyd by a po­lice of­fi­cer i n May, which sparked wide­spread protests against po­lice vi­o­lence i n the United States.</p>
    <p>As pub­lic sen­ti­ment turned against US law en­force­ment, three re­al­ity se­ries were pulled off the air, in­clud­ing the l ong-run­ning Cops (1989 to this year), over fears they would be seen as glo­ri­fy­ing the po­lice. And plans for mak­ing new ones have been shelved.</p>
    <p>But one po­lice show, S.W.A.T. (2017 to present), may be uniquely po­si­tioned to tackle the con­tro­versy over the polic­ing of African-Amer­i­can com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>And it di­rectly ad­dresses the is­sue and the Ge­orge Floyd in­ci­dent in its new sea­son, now air­ing at 9pm on Thurs­days on Fox (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 330, StarHub TV Chan­nel 505) and stream­ing on Fox+.</p>
    <p>Its star and ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer, She­mar Moore, was in­stru­men­tal in the de­ci­sion to in­cor­po­rate the killing of Mr Floyd and the re­sult­ing protests into the sto­ry­line of Sea­son 4.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old plays sergeant “Hondo” Har­rel­son, who is tasked with lead­ing the Los An­ge­les po­lice depart­ment’s S.W.A.T. – or spe­cial weapons and tac­tics team, a unit that uses mil­i­tary equip­ment and tac­tics – as well as eas­ing ten­sions with the lo­cal community.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times by video call from Los An­ge­les, he de­scribes the show as “a thrill ride and a good time for any­one who just wants to see some su­per cops chas­ing down the bad guys”.</p>
    <p>“But I think we’re a unique show be­cause we’re in a per­fect po­si­tion to be able to ad­dress some hard truths,” says the ac­tor, who ap­peared on the crime se­ries Crim­i­nal Minds from 2005 to 2016.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause S.W.A.T. has al­ways paid at­ten­tion to ten­sions be­tween the po­lice and the community. And it is “based on the real men and women who do this, and we take a lot of pride in por­tray­ing how they pro­tect those who can’t pro­tect them­selves”, Moore adds.</p>
    <p>“So even in the first three sea­sons, we talked about top­i­cal is­sues like hu­man traf­fick­ing or school shoot­ings.”</p>
    <p>So for Sea­son 4, he felt the show was duty-bound to ad­dress the anti-po­lice protests.</p>
    <p>When they broke out ear­lier this year, Moore called a meet­ing at his home with the other pro­duc­ers along with net­work ex­ec­u­tives, the head writer and showrun­ner.</p>
    <p>“I said, ‘Look, we have an op­por­tu­nity and a re­spon­si­bil­ity. We can­not be ig­no­rant and deaf and just make generic sto­ries about cops chas­ing bad guys. I think we need to ad­dress some hard truths.’”</p>
    <p>Thus, the se­ries will delve deeply into the his­tory of race ri­ots and protests in the US this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“But we don’t preach,” says Moore. “We don’t tell you what to think or be­lieve. But we beg of you to con­sider all sides.</p>
    <p>“We ac­knowl­edge there are bad ap­ples within law en­force­ment but, pre­dom­i­nantly, we show you they are hu­man be­ings who are flawed but still fight for good.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “I feel like we have a chance to be op­ti­mistic and paint cops in a good light be­cause so many of them are good. Does there need to be more train­ing, could they be bet­ter? Sure, and we talk about it.”</p>
    <p>The com­plex­i­ties of how l aw en­force­ment should po­lice the black community will be ex­plored as sergeant Hondo strug­gles to fig­ure it all out.</p>
    <p>“You see how he and the team deal with the di­vi­sions be­tween po­lice and civil­ians, and how he strug­gles with be­ing a black man and stay­ing true to his community, but also op­ti­mistic that he can be a part of law en­force­ment and pro­mote change and unity.”</p>
    <p>Asked why he thinks other shows might be ner­vous about ad­dress­ing such is­sues, Moore says: “It’s a del­i­cate time. I’m proud that our net­works, CBS and Sony, were brave and bold enough.</p>
    <p>“But I would have a huge prob­lem if they weren’t. It was too im­por­tant for me, as a black man play­ing a cop, to not say some­thing.”</p>
