    <p>While Mr Al Wu was work­ing at home in June, an In­sta­gram ad­ver­tise­ment for an ad­justable-height desk caught his eye.</p>
    <p>Con­vinced by the sleek pho­tos and rave re­views, he placed an or­der on the web­site, Bikkuri Shop.</p>
    <p>But the de­liv­ered prod­uct – cost­ing about $70 – did not work as ad­ver­tised, Mr Wu told The Straits Times. More than two months and dozens of e-mails to the ven­dor later, he has yet to re­ceive the prod­uct ex­change he was promised.</p>
    <p>“They asked for cash on de­liv­ery, so there’s not much I can do. I didn’t have that level of cau­tion,” said the 44-year-old re­searcher, who rarely shops on­line.</p>
    <p>Such en­coun­ters with on­line sellers are not un­com­mon, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey pub­lished by the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Singapore (CCCS) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It found that over a three-month pe­riod, about two-thirds of con­sumers en­coun­tered un­fair prac­tices on on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>False claims re­lat­ing to dis­counts or ben­e­fits, lim­ited time deals and scarcity of goods or ser­vices were the top com­plaints.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey of 650 peo­ple, con­ducted on­line be­tween Novem­ber and De­cem­ber last year by eco­nomic con­sul­tancy Fron­tier Eco­nomics, formed part of a mar­ket study on the e-com­merce land­scape in Singapore.</p>
    <p>Mis­lead­ing ad­ver­tis­ing prac­tices like those high­lighted in the sur­vey have been ad­dressed in the price trans­parency guide­lines that will take ef­fect from Nov 1, the CCCS noted in a 97-page re­port on the mar­ket study.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines will set out how the agency will in­ter­pret and en­force con­sumer pro­tec­tion laws go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>While the guide­lines will ap­ply to all ven­dors that sup­ply goods and ser­vices to con­sumers in Singapore, ob­servers noted the chal­lenges in en­forc­ing the law against over­seas-based on­line sellers.</p>
    <p>Mr Wu, for ex­am­ple, was told by the Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion of Singapore (Case) that he had lit­tle re­course as the ven­dor in his trans­ac­tion was not reg­is­tered in Singapore.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket study found that some e-com­merce plat­forms had mea­sures in place to pro­tect shop­pers from un­scrupu­lous sellers, such as pre-pay­ment pro­tec­tion schemes.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Lazada said its con­sumer pro­tec­tion mea­sures in­clude a de­merit point sys­tem for er­rant sellers that can re­sult in sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>The five-month study also sought views from e-com­merce in­dus­try play­ers and plat­form sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try mem­bers in­ter­viewed cited chal­lenges in polic­ing their plat­forms, with one char­ac­ter­is­ing it as a cat-and-mouse game where bad sellers con­stantly find new ways to evade de­tec­tion of un­fair prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey find­ings sug­gested that more could be done to foster a fair trad­ing en­vi­ron­ment, the CCCS said, adding that it will work with the in­dus­try to pro­mote good prac­tices and con­sumer ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The find­ings co­in­cide with a spurt in on­line shop­ping amid the Covid-19 pan­demic and its re­lated re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>To­tal vis­its to e-com­merce plat­forms in Singapore dur­ing the first half of the year grew by 23 per cent, a study by iPrice Group and Sim­i­larWeb found.</p>
    <p>Case ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Loy York Jiun said there is added ur­gency for more plat­forms to adopt best prac­tices in the light of this trend.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, Case hopes that ecom­merce plat­forms will be more proac­tive in iden­ti­fy­ing on­line sellers who make false or mis­lead­ing claims, and take stronger ac­tion to weed out these er­rant sellers.”</p>
