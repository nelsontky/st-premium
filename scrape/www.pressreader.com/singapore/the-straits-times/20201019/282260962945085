    <p>PARIS • Air­lines face a long, hard win­ter af­ter a much hoped for re­bound from the coro­n­avirus cri­sis failed to ma­te­ri­alise, prompt­ing sav­age cost-cut­ting pro­grammes and fresh calls for gov­ern­ment sup­port.</p>
    <p>“We are in a race against time. The key thing is to have the cash... we need to move quickly, very quickly,” said Mr Stephane Al­bernhe, manag­ing part­ner at Archery Strat­egy Con­sult­ing.</p>
    <p>Air­line rev­enues plunged 80 per cent in the first six months of the year, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata), but they still had fixed costs to cover – crew, main­te­nance, fuel, air­port levies and now air­craft stor­age.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a slight re­cov­ery in July as coro­n­avirus curbs were eased, traf­fic fell again last month while book­ings for the win­ter sea­son – which be­gins on Oct 25 – are down 78 per cent com­pared with a year ear­lier, promis­ing more hard­ship to come.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest dis­ap­point­ments has been the ab­sence of highly lu­cra­tive busi­ness-class trav­ellers who pre­fer now to rely on tele-con­fer­enc­ing rather than run the risk of catch­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Re­peated ef­forts to re­as­sure pas­sen­gers that air travel is safe have failed to make much of a dif­fer­ence while gov­ern­ment re­stric­tions, in­clud­ing quar­an­tines of up to 14 days for re­turn­ing pas­sen­gers in many coun­tries, have only added to the pres­sures on the bat­tered air­line com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“The risk of con­tract­ing Covid-19 dur­ing air travel is re­ally very, very low,” said Dr David Pow­ell, med­i­cal con­sul­tant for Iata.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try as a whole is hop­ing that the in­tro­duc­tion of air­port test­ing sys­tems will re­store pas­sen­ger con­fi­dence and re­duce if not com­pletely re­move the need for dam­ag­ing quar­an­tine regimes.</p>
    <p>There are al­ready trial sys­tems in place in sev­eral ma­jor air­ports around the world and, last Fri­day, France an­nounced it would in­tro­duce quick, anti­gen-based test­ing by the end of the month.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to launch these tests at the air­ports, es­pe­cially for de­par­tures to the United States or Italy and for ar­rivals from coun­tries on the red list (of high rates of in­fec­tion),” French Trans­port Min­is­ter JeanBap­tiste Djeb­bari said on CNews TV chan­nel.</p>
    <p>“That way we will not have any more peo­ple ar­riv­ing on French ter­ri­tory with­out hav­ing been tested.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore, mean­while, have an­nounced that they plan a “travel bub­ble” to al­low un­re­stricted flights.</p>
    <p>Tests may help but given the dam­age al­ready done and the like­li­hood of more to come, Iata con­tin­ues to press the alarm bell, seek­ing more gov­ern­ment help to keep the air­lines afloat un­til there is at least some re­turn to nor­mal­ity.</p>
    <p>Up to now, Iata es­ti­mates gov­ern­ments have pro­vided US$160 bil­lion (S$217 bil­lion) in aid, loans and tax breaks so that air­lines can cover cur­rent costs.</p>
    <p>But af­ter a dis­as­trous sum­mer, usu­ally the busiest part of the year when they build up their cash re­serves, air­lines are not go­ing to be able to do that dur­ing the win­ter, Iata head Alexan­dre de Ju­niac has warned re­peat­edly.</p>
    <p>United Air­lines this month laid off 13,000 staff tem­po­rar­ily as it waited for the politi­cians in Wash­ing­ton to thrash out a fresh coro­n­avirus aid pack­age.</p>
    <p>Low-cost pi­o­neer Ryanair, which prides it­self on not seek­ing state aid, an­nounced last Thurs­day it was cut­ting by a third its al­ready re­duced win­ter sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Other air­lines are think­ing up com­pletely new an­gles to drum up busi­ness, with com­pa­nies in Asia of­fer­ing “flights to nowhere” – short, cir­cu­lar trips for those des­per­ate to get back into the air again and ready to pay for the priv­i­lege.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines even opened up one of its gi­ant A-380 air­craft as a restau­rant, while some started sell­ing their in-flight food to nos­tal­gic, would-be but grounded pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>It has been an “ex­tra­or­di­nary” suc­cess, the Sin­ga­pore car­rier said.</p>
