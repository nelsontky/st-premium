    <p>Sharael Taha Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC</p>
    <p>No one must be left be­hind as the coun­try works together to trans­form the econ­omy and weather the cur­rent storm, Mr Sharael said. And as the work­force ages, jobs need to be re­designed to make the best use of work­ers’ ex­pe­ri­ence and abil­i­ties, he added. He sug­gested step­ping up en­force­ment and hand­ing out harsher penal­ties to en­sure firms abide by fair hir­ing prac­tices, and in­crease equal em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for se­niors, care­givers and those with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“As we work together to trans­form our econ­omy, trans­for­ma­tion can­not hap­pen at the ex­pense of oth­ers. We must care for one an­other and not leave any­one be­hind. Busi­nesses must do their part to pro­vide fair op­por­tu­ni­ties for the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Alvin Tan</p>
    <p>Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC</p>
    <p>Minister of State for Trade and In­dus­try and Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said the pan­demic has given Sin­ga­pore the chance to re­struc­ture the econ­omy to­wards sus­tain­able and green so­lu­tions while re­main­ing com­pet­i­tive. He also called for more to be done to in­clude peo­ple from dif­fer­ent back­grounds and of dif­fer­ent abil­i­ties, es­pe­cially if they have phys­i­cal or men­tal chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“We need in­clu­sive poli­cies and norms to en­sure that peo­ple feel safe and unashamed to use men­tal health re­sources. When we fall down, we suf­fer a phys­i­cal in­jury. What about men­tal in­jury?</p>
    <p>How do we heal? If we can ac­cept seek­ing help for our body, there is no rea­son why we can­not ac­cept the same for our mind.”</p>
    <p>Hazel Poa Non-Con­stituency MP</p>
    <p>Ms Poa, who owns an ed­u­ca­tion busi­ness, said that while gov­ern­ment sup­port dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic is es­sen­tial, Sin­ga­pore should con­tinue to ex­er­cise fi­nan­cial pru­dence in the use of its re­serves. She also called for a re­view of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, to claw back pay­ments from firms that are still prof­itable and rechan­nel funds to where they are needed. She sug­gested a de­fer­ment of mort­gage pay­ments – up to December next year – for those who have lost their jobs or suf­fered a loss in in­come.</p>
    <p>“This pan­demic is like a tide rolling out, ex­pos­ing our vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties pre­vi­ously un­der the sur­face. We need to muster the courage to have an hon­est eval­u­a­tion of where we are in the work in progress we call the Sin­ga­pore story. We need to keep an open mind and be pre­pared to tackle sa­cred cows.”</p>
    <p>Car­rie Tan Nee Soon GRC</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, who is the founder and strate­gic di­rec­tor of char­ity Daugh­ters Of To­mor­row, said it is im­por­tant to main­tain the dig­nity, self-es­teem and morale of those who need fi­nan­cial help. She also said ca­reer op­por­tu­nity costs for women and a lack of care­giv­ing sup­port are bar­ri­ers to boost­ing the birth rate. She sug­gested, among other things, that work­place poli­cies sup­port work­ing care­givers to pave the way for eas­ier re-en­try into the work­force.</p>
    <p>“(Our lead­ers) have ded­i­cated much of their lives and un­count­able sleep­less nights for the good of our coun­try. It is a heavy cross to bear, but there is no need to bear it alone. The youth of to­day are pas­sion­ate be­cause they care so much for Sin­ga­pore. Many have good ideas and many are ca­pa­ble. It is now our cross to bear too.”</p>
