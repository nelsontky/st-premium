    <p>Fifty-seven peo­ple are un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for al­legedly breach­ing Covid-19 rules at un­li­censed pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment out­lets in Ubi Road 1 and Kal­lang Pud­ding Road.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said on Wed­nes­day they are sus­pected of gath­er­ing in groups of more than five, and are be­tween the ages of 19 and 66.</p>
    <p>Two men are un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for pro­vid­ing pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment and sell­ing liquor with­out a valid li­cence. Photos from the po­lice show a room with a group of at least eight peo­ple, with what ap­pear to be al­co­holic drinks on the ta­bles. An­other photo shows ta­bles with drinks that ap­pear to be beer bot­tles.</p>
    <p>In the same en­force­ment oper­a­tion be­tween Oct 28 and 31, seven peo­ple were ar­rested for sus­pected drug-re­lated of­fences. The four men and three women are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau.</p>
    <p>Since phase two of Covid-19 mea­sures be­gan on June 19, groups have been re­quired to keep a dis­tance of at least 1m from one an­other in pub­lic, and gath­er­ings of more than five are not al­lowed. Breaches of these mea­sures can re­sult in fines.</p>
    <p>First-time of­fend­ers face a com­po­si­tion fine of $300 and re­peat of­fend­ers face higher fines. Egre­gious cases may face pros­e­cu­tion in court, and of­fend­ers can be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed for up to six months.</p>
    <p>The of­fence of pro­vid­ing pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment with­out a valid li­cence car­ries a fine of up to $20,000, while the of­fence of sup­ply­ing liquor with­out a valid li­cence car­ries the same fine.</p>
