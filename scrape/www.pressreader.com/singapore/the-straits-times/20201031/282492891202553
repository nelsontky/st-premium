    <p>The On­line Ci­ti­zen (TOC) con­trib­u­tor Daniel De Costa was act­ing in good faith when he made al­legedly defam­a­tory state­ments, his lawyer M. Ravi ar­gued in court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi, who is from Carson Law Cham­bers, said his client had not been ma­li­cious and had sim­ply re­peated al­le­ga­tions made ear­lier by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s sib­lings – Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling – while be­liev­ing them to be true.</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, those who ex­press opin­ions about the pub­lic con­duct of pub­lic ser­vants in good faith are not guilty of defama­tion, he ar­gued on the fourth day of a crim­i­nal defama­tion trial that has been ad­journed till next month.</p>
    <p>De Costa and TOC ed­i­tor Terry Xu were both charged in 2018 for al­legedly de­fam­ing mem­bers of the Sin­ga­pore Cab­i­net in a let­ter pub­lished on the TOC web­site.</p>
    <p>“The present PAP lead­er­ship se­verely lacks in­no­va­tion, vi­sion and the drive to take us into the next lap,” said the let­ter, which was writ­ten by De Costa and pub­lished by</p>
    <p>Xu. “We have seen mul­ti­ple pol­icy and for­eign screw-ups, tam­per­ing of the Con­sti­tu­tion, cor­rup­tion at the high­est ech­e­lons and ap­par­ent lack of re­spect from for­eign pow­ers ever since the demise of found­ing fa­ther Lee Kuan Yew.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi said his client had sim­ply in­tended to re­peat what PM Lee’s sib­lings had al­leged in a joint state­ment in 2017.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee were not sued by PM Lee, nor were they in­ves­ti­gated for crim­i­nal defama­tion, Mr Ravi noted.</p>
    <p>It was there­fore his client’s gen­uine be­lief, he added, that PM Lee had in­deed “mis­used his power as prime min­is­ter” and “hi­jacked the or­gans of state” as PM Lee’s sib­lings had claimed, and De Costa be­lieved them to be cred­i­ble.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi put forth th­ese ar­gu­ments in the course of mak­ing an ap­pli­ca­tion to have the pros­e­cu­tion dis­close De Costa’s long state­ment made to the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment dur­ing the po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion in 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi had made the same ap­pli­ca­tion at an ear­lier stage of the trial in Jan­uary be­fore District Judge Christo­pher Tan, who was then pre­sid­ing over the case. Mr Tan has since been ap­pointed a Reg­is­trar of the State Courts and the case is now be­ing heard by District Judge Ng Peng Hong.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Xu’s lawyer, Mr Remy Choo of Peter Low and Choo law firm, made a sim­i­lar ap­pli­ca­tion to have Xu’s recorded state­ment dis­closed. He ar­gued that the state­ment is rel­e­vant to the ques­tion of Xu’s in­ten­tions in pub­lish­ing the let­ter and whether he de­lib­er­ately did so know­ing it would harm the rep­u­ta­tion of Cab­i­net mem­bers.</p>
    <p>A “key plank” of the de­fence’s case is that there was no ref­er­ence to mem­bers of the Cab­i­net in the claim that there was “cor­rup­tion at the high­est ech­e­lons”, Mr Choo said, adding that an or­di­nary, rea­son­able reader of the ar­ti­cle would not con­clude that it refers to Cab­i­net mem­bers.</p>
    <p>District Judge Ng dis­missed the ap­pli­ca­tions to have the state­ments dis­closed, in line with District Judge Tan’s ear­lier de­ci­sion to do the same.</p>
    <p>The par­ties will re­turn to the State Courts for a pre-trial con­fer­ence on Nov 19 be­fore the re­sump­tion of the trial.</p>
