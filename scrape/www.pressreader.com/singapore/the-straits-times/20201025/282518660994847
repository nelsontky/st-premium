    <p>As a woman and mother, I am grate­ful to live in the most ac­cept­ing time for di­ver­sity and in­clu­siv­ity in beauty, al­beit amid the most in­tol­er­ant geopo­lit­i­cal di­vide known in liv­ing mem­ory.</p>
    <p>His­tory re­minds us beauty is not truth nor is it set in stone, and it is con­stantly chang­ing.</p>
    <p>As a child with oo­dles of Bar­bie dolls, I used non-per­ma­nent mark­ers to give them make-up and scis­sors to up­date their pre­dictable, flow­ing manes.</p>
    <p>All were white and Cau­casian with blonde hair, save a few brunettes. Every sin­gle one show­cased that cov­eted hour­glass fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Thirty-plus years on, when my daugh­ter Happy was born, I in­ten­tion­ally re­stricted Bar­bies from her world, not want­ing to per­pet­u­ate such an idolised stan­dard of beauty.</p>
    <p>Not un­til 2007, when we left the Big Ap­ple to live in Sin­ga­pore, did Happy, then 41/ years old, learn of</p>
    <p>2 th­ese dolls. When I col­lected her from school one af­ter­noon, she de­clared: “Mummy, we need two Bar­bies.”</p>
    <p>“Oh dear. Why?” I asked gin­gerly. “Be­cause I need to give one away, but I also want one,” she replied earnestly, fol­lowed with a po­lite “please”.</p>
    <p>Her kinder­garten was or­gan­is­ing a “Do­nate Your Bar­bie” drive to send dolls to an or­phan­age in</p>
    <p>China. How could I de­cline?</p>
    <p>Bar­bie turned 60 last year with an in­clu­sive “You Can Be Any­thing” cam­paign.</p>
    <p>To­day, var­i­ous it­er­a­tions of the doll ex­ist, some petite and oth­ers with curvy frames, in a dozen-plus skin tones, with ca­reers as as­tro­nauts, lawyers and pa­le­on­tol­o­gists. Not only has Bar­bie evolved, but so have we all.</p>
    <p>As a woman and mother, I am grate­ful to live in the most ac­cept­ing time for di­ver­sity and in­clu­siv­ity in beauty, al­beit amid the most in­tol­er­ant geopo­lit­i­cal di­vide known in liv­ing mem­ory.</p>
    <p>His­tory re­minds us beauty is not truth nor is it set in stone, and it is con­stantly chang­ing. Presently, no one would be caught dead with a uni­brow, but look to the an­cient Greeks, who elon­gated their eye­brows into near-one­ness. The Han Dy­nasty prized mi­nus­cule feet as utopian beauty. Me­di­ae­val Ja­panese women – like many around the world, in­clud­ing 25-year-old Queen El­iz­a­beth in 1558 – as­so­ci­ated pale skin with wealth and leisure. Us­ing pow­der, they painted their faces white.</p>
    <p>France’s King Louis XVI, who adored pageantry and make-up, de­creed at only 17, when his hair­line be­gan re­ced­ing, that men should wear wigs in his court. Dur­ing the Vic­to­rian era, women lit­er­ally suf­fered for beauty, ap­ply­ing make-up con­tain­ing mer­cury, lead, ar­senic and am­mo­nia.</p>
    <p>Back then, the ul­ti­mate re­fine­ment in­volved a tiny waist and those mi­nus­cule rose­bud lips, which would be ridiculed to­day as we line our lips larger than life.</p>
    <p>The Roar­ing 1920s – with flap­per dresses, nary a corset in sight and bras worn only to flat­ten breasts – brought on boy­ish fig­ures. With a bit of in­de­pen­dence, women be­came more self-aware, vy­ing less to gain ap­pre­ci­a­tion from men.</p>
    <p>World War II and the De­pres­sion led fe­males to fo­cus on not look­ing thin, for ob­vi­ous rea­sons. Fast for­ward to the su­per­model look of the 1980s – toned yet curvy, at­tained through the Jane Fonda fit­ness craze – that some­how fed into the thinnest beauty ideal ever known, the waif look or “heroin chic”. Model Kate Moss, who fa­mously said “noth­ing tastes as good as skinny feels”, reigned supreme.</p>
    <p>In 2020, we find our­selves in the Kim Kar­dashian mo­ment of flat stom­ach, large breasts and der­riere – al­beit with the ul­ti­mate thigh gap.</p>
    <p>Yet, with em­bold­ened, in­de­pen­dent women and with non-bi­nary ac­cep­tance – aided by the po­tency of the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment, which has seen so­cially aware young peo­ple call­ing out in­jus­tices such as dis­crim­i­na­tion against peo­ple of darker skin tones – the past de­crees and rules of beauty are col­laps­ing.</p>
    <p>Ver­sace re­cently show­cased three full-fig­ured women – Pre­cious Lee, Alva Claire, and Jill Kortleve – walk­ing in its Mi­lan fash­ion show. Feel­ing re­lief, I could fore­see a fu­ture with fe­males, who re­sem­ble real women, rep­re­sent­ing us all.</p>
    <p>Has the Western or Euro­cen­tric beauty stan­dard of fair skin fi­nally been tossed aside? Not en­tirely, but the pos­i­tive news is that me­dia and ad­ver­tis­ers are in­clud­ing re­al­is­tic por­tray­als of women.</p>
    <p>To­day, we de­sire strik­ing, dis­tinc­tive faces, which re­flect di­ver­sity. When singer Ri­hanna’s Fenty Beauty launched 40 shades of foun­da­tion, other cos­met­ics com­pa­nies awoke from their com­pla­cent lull.</p>
    <p>With a vi­sion of “Beauty For All”, Fenty Beauty now ships to 137 coun­tries and in­cludes a men’s range called Gentle­men’s Fenty Face.</p>
    <p>As a mother of teens, I am em­bar­rassed to ad­mit I find it dif­fi­cult to em­brace this present mo­ment of bend­ing gen­der norms.</p>
    <p>While some men use as much prod­uct as I do or more, if I dare say some­thing like “men should not wear make-up”, my daugh­ter Bee, 12, shrugs, shak­ing her head dis­mis­sively.</p>
    <p>“Get with it, mother. This is our world. Men and women are tak­ing beauty into their own hands. James Charles (influencer) looks fab­u­lous in make-up and Billy Porter (ac­tor) wears skirts,” she says.</p>
    <p>I sup­pose I have much to un­learn from a life­time of in­grained stereo­types.</p>
    <p>In­evitably, the open­ness and tol­er­ance, and ubiq­ui­tous self­ies, do not stop peo­ple from as­pir­ing to look good.</p>
    <p>The plethora of op­tions – think plas­tic surgery, fillers (for the face and even the bum) and beauty fil­ters on apps – means a mas­sive amount of money is spent on aes­thet­ics.</p>
    <p>I con­fess that when I have a vi­ta­min-C treat­ment over lunch and later meet friends for din­ner, I ap­pre­ci­ate the com­pli­ments on my ra­di­ant glow.</p>
    <p>Still, I have yet to go un­der the knife, although the global cos­metic surgery mar­ket may be worth more than US$50 billion (S$68 billion) in five years’ time.</p>
    <p>In South Korea, one in three women be­tween the ages of 19 and 29 has un­der­gone cos­metic surgery, ac­cord­ing to Gallup Korea. Some say this is tragic, while oth­ers find com­fort in know­ing they can “fix” what they do not like.</p>
    <p>This cur­rent ac­cep­tance con­tin­ues to our body size and pro­por­tions.</p>
    <p>Kar­dashian, who has been a long-time pro­po­nent of wear­ing shapewear to smooth and con­tort the body, has in­tro­duced Skims. The shapewear pieces come in nine colours, from size XXS to 5SL, be­cause our fig­ure – any colour and size – is no bar­rier to beauty. Take that, Bar­bie.</p>
    <p>Six years ago, I was swim­ming with the young son of a fam­ily friend when he shrieked: “Aun­tie Paige, Aun­tie Paige. What is it? What are those spots on your arms?”</p>
    <p>As a youth, hav­ing a tan and not be­ing too fair was my aim as I lath­ered Hawai­ian Tropic oil onto my body at the beach. Since I did not pro­tect my skin (my par­ents did not know the dan­gers of sun exposure), as an adult, I have suf­fered skin can­cer twice, although non-ma­lig­nant. Alas, my arms are cov­ered in sun spots and freck­les due to an ideal beauty stan­dard I cher­ished as a teen.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, what one finds gor­geous, an­other will not bat an eye at. Nearly all of us, save model Bella Ha­did with her vir­tu­ally flaw­less “Golden Ra­tio” face, must find peace and pride in be­ing per­fectly im­per­fect.</p>
    <p>• This is the fi­nal per­sonal col­umn to run in Life. All such col­umns on Sun­day will move to the new Views sec­tion from next week.</p>
