    <p>RIBE (Den­mark) The fire crack­les and a woman shrieks as flames lick her body, burn­ing her alive.</p>
    <p>A mu­seum in Den­mark is bring­ing the dark pe­riod of witch­hunt­ing to life.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated in the home of a for­mer witch hunter, the Hex! Mu­seum Of Witch Hunt in the town of Ribe sheds light on how the fear of witches led to a wave of per­se­cu­tion that swept across Den­mark and Europe in the 16th and 17th cen­turies.</p>
    <p>While Dan­ish chil­dren to­day dress up as witches and wiz­ards for Hal­loween, Den­mark at the time was a religious and su­per­sti­tious Lutheran so­ci­ety where fear and dis­trust were in­ter­twined with the se­cret use of magic to keep God’s wrath at bay.</p>
    <p>Across Europe, ap­prox­i­mately 100,000 peo­ple went on trial for witch­craft, with as many as 50,000 burned, mu­seum his­to­rian Louise Hauberg Lindgaard told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Den­mark sen­tenced 1,000 peo­ple to death for witch­craft – which, she said, was “quite a lot” given that the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion was then around one mil­lion. Most of those sen­tenced were women be­lieved to be col­lud­ing with the devil.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, Ger­many – the coun­try in Europe with the most witch hunts – held 16,500 tri­als, more than 40 per cent of which ended with the ac­cused be­ing burned at the stake.</p>
    <p>Den­mark’s hos­til­ity to witch­craft can be largely at­trib­uted to King Chris­tian IV, who lived from 1577 to 1648, Ms Hauberg Lindgaard said.</p>
    <p>Un­der his rule, the coun­try’s first leg­is­la­tion against the prac­tice was adopted in 1617, send­ing blackmagic prac­ti­tion­ers to the stake.</p>
    <p>In the eight years af­ter the law was adopted, per­se­cu­tions were ram­pant, with a witch burned ev­ery five days.</p>
    <p>For the monarch – like many con­tem­po­raries, in­clud­ing his broth­erin-law King James VI of Scot­land and Eng­land, also a cham­pion of witch hunts – the per­se­cu­tions were a way to re­tain power and pro­ject the im­age of a good Chris­tian car­ing for his sub­jects.</p>
    <p>Ms Hauberg Lindgaard said mon­archs as­sumed this re­spon­si­bil­ity af­ter 16th-cen­tury French philoso­pher Jean Bodin de­clared that if a king did not per­se­cute witches, he was solely re­spon­si­ble for his sub­jects’ mis­for­tune.</p>
    <p>At the time, any­thing could be a pre­text for de­nounc­ing witches, from an off­hand re­mark to a sus­pi­cious charm, and the ac­cused were put on trial.</p>
    <p>The mu­seum opened at the end of June, at­tract­ing 10,000 vis­i­tors in the first month – a strong show­ing at­trib­uted to cool sum­mer weather and the pop­u­lar sub­ject mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple love to watch and read about all things ‘witchy’... such as nov­els, movies and tele­vi­sion se­ries, and the more his­toric as­pects,” Ms Hauberg Lindgaard said.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­est­ingly, the ‘his­toric truths’ per­tain­ing to the witch-hunt era have since been blurred and rein­ter­preted by more pop­u­lar no­tions of the topic, and we can def­i­nitely feel the de­sire to un­der­stand ‘what ac­tu­ally hap­pened’ among our guests,” she said.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors learn that while most witches were women, “up to one in four was a man”, she said. They were of­ten “sin­gle and liv­ing on the edge of so­ci­ety – quite poor”.</p>
    <p>Brooms, amulets, dolls and other items are on dis­play, as are tor­ture in­stru­ments and an­i­mated re­con­struc­tions of witch tri­als, ac­com­pa­nied by eerie mu­sic.</p>
    <p>For 21-year-old Dan­ish vis­i­tor Mathilda, the mu­seum was an op­por­tu­nity to learn more about a pe­riod she hardly knows.</p>
    <p>“It’s very ex­cit­ing to hear about this stuff. It’s some­thing that not only hap­pened here in Den­mark but also in a lot of other coun­tries,” she said.</p>
    <p>The build­ing in which the mu­seum is housed has a his­tory of its own.</p>
    <p>It was built in the late 16th cen­tury by a witch hunter who played a key role in seven tri­als, three of which ended with sus­pects burned at the stake.</p>
    <p>The pic­turesque town of Ribe it­self is also hal­lowed ground. Founded in the Vik­ing era, peo­ple once be­lieved it was where witches learnt their craft in the 1600s.</p>
    <p>It is also the Dan­ish town that held the most tri­als per cit­i­zen, Ms Hauberg Lindgaard said.</p>
    <p>The last per­son ac­cused of be­ing a witch and burned in Den­mark was Anna Bruds in 1652.</p>
