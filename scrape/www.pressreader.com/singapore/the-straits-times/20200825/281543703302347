    <p>Ap­ple is set to open its third store in Sin­ga­pore, though the US tech gi­ant has not spec­i­fied an open­ing date yet. It will be sit­u­ated in the dome-like struc­ture sit­ting on the wa­ter off Ma­rina Bay Sands, and will be the first Ap­ple store in the world that sits on wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple is set to open its third store in Sin­ga­pore, even as the re­tail and tourism sec­tors con­tinue to be buf­feted by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the tech gi­ant con­firmed that its third store will open at Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) “soon”, al­though it did not spec­ify an open­ing date.</p>
    <p>The new store will be sit­u­ated in the dome-like struc­ture sit­ting on the wa­ter off MBS that was oc­cu­pied by mega night­club Avalon from 2011 to 2016.</p>
    <p>“Ap­ple Ma­rina Bay Sands is com­ing soon to the heart of Sin­ga­pore, cel­e­brat­ing the first Ap­ple store in the world that sits on the wa­ter,” an Ap­ple spokesman said. “As with every Ap­ple store around the world, Ap­ple Ma­rina Bay Sands will bring the best of Ap­ple to our cus­tomers... We can’t wait to see you soon.”</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment comes af­ter The Straits Times re­ported in March last year that Ap­ple would be open­ing two more stores here at Jewel Changi Air­port and MBS. Ap­ple’s Jewel store opened in July last year. The store at Knights­bridge mall in Or­chard Road opened in 2017.</p>
    <p>On his visit to the Repub­lic in De­cem­ber, Ap­ple chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Tim Cook said Sin­ga­pore “could use a third store” as the</p>
    <p>Or­chard Road one was “pretty full”.</p>
    <p>But few stores in Sin­ga­pore re­main full at the mo­ment, with the re­tail and tourism sec­tors both hard hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales plunged by more than 50 per cent in May from a year ear­lier, while only 2,200 tourists came to Sin­ga­pore in June com­pared with nearly 1.6 mil­lion for the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Dr Se­shan Ra­maswami, as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of mar­ket­ing ed­u­ca­tion at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, noted that it is “un­usual” to see ma­jor store open­ings dur­ing crises like the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“For now, the new store will likely not gen­er­ate ex­cess de­mand,” he said. “But good lo­ca­tions in premium malls like MBS that at­tract a very ex­clu­sive clien­tele are not al­ways avail­able, and com­pa­nies with deep pock­ets, such as Ap­ple, (could) use the cri­sis to ne­go­ti­ate a good rental.”</p>
    <p>Ap­ple is the most valu­able com­pany in the world and be­came the first Amer­i­can firm to be val­ued at US$2 tril­lion (S$2.74 tril­lion) ear­lier this month. It shrugged off the ef­fects of the pan­demic to post record sales and an 11 per cent yearon-year in­crease in third-quar­ter rev­enue to US$59.7 bil­lion last month.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Poly­tech­nic mar­ket­ing and re­tail lec­turer Amos Tan said the store open­ing could be part of Ap­ple’s strat­egy to ramp up ad­ver­tis­ing when most other com­pa­nies are strug­gling and ly­ing low.</p>
    <p>“It’s ex­actly in times like th­ese when there’s very lit­tle noise around that savvy play­ers like Ap­ple can come in strong, spend more money and in­crease their over­all pres­ence,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>“We call this ‘re­minder ad­ver­tis­ing’ be­cause you are re­mind­ing con­sumers of your brand, and Ap­ple has been very ag­gres­sive re­cently.”</p>
    <p>Busi­ness un­der­grad­u­ate and iPhone user Leonard Chong, 25, said he did not see a rea­son to go out of his way to visit the store when it opens, though. “I may pop in to check (the store) out if I hap­pen to be in the area, but there’re many other av­enues to get your hands on Ap­ple prod­ucts in Sin­ga­pore. For ex­am­ple, I could go to an au­tho­rised re­seller nearer my home or buy a sec­ond-hand de­vice on­line.”</p>
