    <p>• The United States Army wants to re­move any sort of di­vi­sive sym­bols from mil­i­tary bases, the army sec­re­tary said on Thurs­day, sug­gest­ing the Pen­tagon was close to a broader pol­icy bar­ring such sym­bols from all mil­i­tary in­stal­la­tions.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of mil­i­tary ser­vices, in­clud­ing the Marine Corps, have al­ready banned the dis­play of Con­fed­er­ate flags even as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said that fly­ing the flag is “free­dom of speech”.</p>
    <p>“Any­thing that is a di­vi­sive sym­bol, we do want to take those of our in­stal­la­tions and that sort of thing out of our for­ma­tion,” Army Sec­re­tary Ryan McCarthy told re­porters with­out spec­i­fy­ing the sym­bols.</p>
    <p>Asked if that would i nclude specif­i­cally iden­ti­fy­ing Con­fed­er­ate flags as di­vi­sive sym­bols, Mr McCarthy, who was ap­pointed by Mr Trump to his role last year, said: “We would have any di­vi­sive sym­bols on a no-fly list, if you will.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Mr McCarthy said he was not specif­i­cally re­fer­ring to the Con­fed­er­ate flag and would de­fer to the Pen­tagon on any spe­cific guid­ance on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Mr McCarthy added that the Pen­tagon was close to a de­ci­sion on a uni­form pol­icy for the dif­fer­ent ser­vices on di­vi­sive sym­bols.</p>
    <p>Re­cent US so­cial un­rest has raised new ques­tions about Con­fed­er­ate sym­bols, in­clud­ing mon­u­ments, memo­ri­als and the flag, as most con­sider them em­blems of slav­ery, racism and xeno­pho­bia.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers say they rep­re­sent the South’s her­itage and cul­ture, and serve as a me­mo­rial to Con­fed­er­ate ca­su­al­ties dur­ing the 1861-65 Civil War.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has stoked racial di­vi­sions as part of his re­elec­tion cam­paign, has crit­i­cised the des­e­cra­tion and re­moval of stat­ues of Con­fed­er­ate and other for­mer US lead­ers to en­er­gise his po­lit­i­cal base.</p>
    <p>Last month, he re­jected re­nam­ing mil­i­tary bases named af­ter Con­fed­er­ate gen­er­als, slap­ping down Pen­tagon of­fi­cials who openly dis­cuss the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Last week, the top US gen­eral said the mil­i­tary had to take a “hard look” at sym­bols of the Con­fed­er­acy, in­clud­ing base names.</p>
