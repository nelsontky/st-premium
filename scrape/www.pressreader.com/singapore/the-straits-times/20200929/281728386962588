    <p>SMALL TAX BILL</p>
    <p>In 2016 and 2017, Mr Don­ald Trump paid just US$750 (S$1,030) in fed­eral in­come taxes, ac­cord­ing to the New York Times.</p>
    <p>In 10 of the pre­vi­ous 15 years, he paid no fed­eral in­come taxes at all.</p>
    <p>De­spite re­port­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in in­come, Mr Trump ef­fec­tively erased his tax bill by re­port­ing heavy losses across his busi­ness in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>HIGH-PRO­FILE LOSSES</p>
    <p>Some of Mr Trump’s most prom­i­nent real es­tate hold­ings have also been less than prof­itable, the Times re­ported. Mr Trump has re­ported a loss of over US$315 mil­lion on golf cour­ses since 2000, with much of that cen­tred on Trump Na­tional Do­ral near Mi­ami.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel he opened in the heart of Washington in 2016 has recorded more than US$55 mil­lion in losses, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>An ex­cep­tion is Trump Tower in</p>
    <p>New York, which re­li­ably earns him more than US$20 mil­lion in prof­its a year.</p>
    <p>A BIG AU­DIT</p>
    <p>The Times re­port also found that Mr Trump has been feud­ing with the In­ter­nal Rev­enue Ser­vice (IRS) for the last decade over a nearly US$73 mil­lion tax re­fund he pre­vi­ously claimed.</p>
    <p>If the IRS were to pre­vail in its au­dit, which has seem­ingly stalled in re­cent years, Mr Trump could be re­spon­si­ble for pay­ing more than US$100 mil­lion to the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>BRAND IM­AGE</p>
    <p>The Times also found that a large amount of Mr Trump’s prof­its came from sell­ing Mr Trump him­self.</p>
    <p>It re­ported that the for­mer re­al­ity tele­vi­sion star made a com­bined US$427.4 mil­lion from 2004 to 2018 by sell­ing his name and im­age through var­i­ous en­dorse­ments and li­cens­ing deals.</p>
    <p>The Times said Mr Trump used pro­ceeds of his celebrity to pur­chase and prop up some of his other busi­nesses, in­clud­ing those which were los­ing money.</p>
    <p>AG­GRES­SIVE WRITE-OFFS</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has been ag­gres­sive in claim­ing cer­tain busi­ness ex­penses that fur­ther shrank his tax bill, ac­cord­ing to the Times.</p>
    <p>That in­cludes US$70,000 i n hair-styling ex­penses tied to The Ap­pren­tice, his for­mer tele­vi­sion pro­gramme, and clas­si­fy­ing a New York prop­erty – de­scribed by the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion as a fam­ily re­treat – to be an in­vest­ment prop­erty to write off mil­lions in prop­erty taxes.</p>
    <p>LOANS COM­ING DUE</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, Mr Trump nearly ru­ined him­self by per­son­ally guar­an­tee­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in loans, and he has since said that he re­gret­ted do­ing so.</p>
    <p>But he has taken the same step again, his tax records show.</p>
    <p>He ap­pears to be re­spon­si­ble for loans to­talling US$421 mil­lion, most of which is com­ing due within four years.</p>
    <p>Should he win an­other term in of­fice, his lenders could be placed in the un­prece­dented po­si­tion of weigh­ing whether to fore­close on a sit­ting pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>LARGE RE­FUND CRU­CIAL TO TAX AVOID­ANCE</p>
    <p>Mr Trump did face large tax bills af­ter the ini­tial suc­cess of The Ap­pren­tice tele­vi­sion show, but he erased most of these tax pay­ments through a re­fund.</p>
    <p>Com­bined, Mr Trump ini­tially paid al­most US$95 mil­lion in fed­eral in­come taxes over the 18 years. He later man­aged to re­coup most of that money, with in­ter­est, by ap­ply­ing for and re­ceiv­ing a US$72.9 mil­lion tax re­fund, start­ing in 2010.</p>
    <p>The re­fund re­duced his to­tal fed­eral in­come tax bill be­tween 2000 and 2017 to an an­nual av­er­age of US$1.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, the av­er­age Amer­i­can in the top 0.001 per cent of earn­ers paid about US$25 mil­lion in fed­eral in­come taxes each year over the same span.</p>
