    <p>Ride-hail­ing pas­sen­gers us­ing the Grab plat­form will no longer travel in old cars by July 2022, with the firm phas­ing out th­ese ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Grab driv­ers who op­er­ate cars that are seven years old and above will also be re­quired to com­plete an ad­di­tional safety and main­te­nance course.</p>
    <p>Th­ese changes were an­nounced by the op­er­a­tor on Fri­day, in re­sponse to the in­tro­duc­tion of reg­u­la­tions aimed at lev­el­ling the play­ing field be­tween taxi com­pa­nies and ride-hail­ing oper­a­tors.</p>
    <p>This new set of stricter rules for ride-hail­ing firms – which brings them un­der sim­i­lar reg­u­la­tions as taxi com­pa­nies – comes un­der the Point-to-Point (P2P) Pas­sen­ger Trans­port In­dus­try Act that was passed in Par­lia­ment last year.</p>
    <p>Grab, along with Go­jek, Tada Mo­bil­ity and Com­fort Trans­porta­tion, were awarded the ride-hail li­cence for oper­a­tors that of­fer book­ing ser­vices through mo­bile apps.</p>
    <p>Grab was also awarded the car­pool li­cence to let it op­er­ate its GrabHitch ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Ryde Tech­nolo­gies was awarded a pro­vi­sional li­cence to run both car­pool­ing and ride-hail­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Grab said on Fri­day that the phas­ing out of older cars will help it to ful­fil a new re­quire­ment for manda­tory in­spec­tion.</p>
    <p>Cars on its plat­form are re­quired to achieve a first in­spec­tion pass­ing rate of at least 90 per cent. The road­wor­thi­ness and emis­sion stan­dards of ve­hi­cles are checked dur­ing the in­spec­tion.</p>
    <p>New driv­ers can now sign up to Grab only if their cars are be­low 10 years old.</p>
    <p>From Nov 1 next year, ex­ist­ing driv­ers can drive only cars that are be­low 12 years old.</p>
    <p>By July 2022, all driv­ers’ cars must be be­low 10 years old.</p>
    <p>Grab did not dis­close how many cars would be af­fected by the change, but said it will help driv­ers who are af­fected.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times un­der­stands that Go­jek will work with driv­ers and ve­hi­cle own­ers to meet the re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Other new re­quire­ments, like taxi driv­ers be­ing able to sign up with any ride-hail­ing firm, also took ef­fect on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) and the Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil (PTC) said: “The new frame­work pro­vides LTA and the PTC with greater reg­u­la­tory over­sight over the P2P sec­tor, to pro­tect the safety and in­ter­ests of P2P com­muters and driv­ers.”</p>
    <p>PTC added the new frame­work will also en­able it to take ac­tion against fare eva­sion and over­charg­ing by driv­ers on trips booked through li­censed ride-hail ser­vice oper­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Com­fortDelGro group chief cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cer Tammy Tan said the reg­u­la­tory frame­work pro­tects the in­ter­ests of com­muters and en­sures ride­hail­ing oper­a­tors are sub­ject to “sim­i­lar strict guide­lines that have been in place for taxi oper­a­tors for so many years”.</p>
