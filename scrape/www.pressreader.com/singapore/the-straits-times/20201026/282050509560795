    <p>Af­ter miss­ing the tar­get com­pletely on her first few at­tempts, po­lice trainee Noorafi­dah Mo­hamed Nasar found her­self dread­ing shoot­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>But with the help of a new sen­sor-based train­ing sys­tem, she is now ea­ger to work on her shoot­ing skills at the fir­ing range.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a me­dia demon­stra­tion of the En­hanced Live Fir­ing Range Sys­tem (El­fras) last Wed­nes­day, Sergeant Noorafi­dah, 27, re­called her ini­tial lack of con­fi­dence and the vast im­prove­ments she made af­ter us­ing the new sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Most of the first-time shoot­ers were like that... I didn’t want to do it any­more (but) the train­ers en­cour­aged me to keep on try­ing be­cause if I don’t try, I will not know how well I can do. Now, I’m more con­fi­dent than be­fore.”</p>
    <p>El­fras, which is for pis­tols and was de­vel­oped by the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF) and Home Team Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Agency, uses sen­sors to cap­ture weapon han­dling, breath­ing, shoot­ing pos­ture, gaze and vis­ual align­ment.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a sen­sor at­tached to the pis­tol tracks the weapon’s move­ment be­fore, dur­ing and af­ter the trig­ger is pulled, while an­other sen­sor, worn like a pair of spec­ta­cles, tracks eye move­ment to see if the trainee blinks while fir­ing.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem is then able to pro­vide real-time feed­back once the round has been fired. These tips in­clude “heel­ing, an­tic­i­pat­ing re­coil” or “too much or too lit­tle trig­ger fin­ger”. A trainer on site will then pin­point where ex­actly the trainees went wrong in their tech­nique.</p>
    <p>SPF Su­per­in­ten­dent Joseph Yoong Chun Yeon said: “Right now, train­ers are only able to, based on their ex­pe­ri­ence as well as their ob­ser­va­tions, iden­tify cer­tain gaps as well as short­com­ings of the trainee. With the use of tech­nol­ogy such as El­fras, we are able to cap­ture ob­jec­tive data.”</p>
    <p>Supt Yoong is also head of the in­struc­tional tech­nol­ogy di­vi­sion of SPF’s train­ing and ca­pa­bil­ity de­vel­op­ment depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Sgt Noorafi­dah is one of the trainees who have tested the sys­tem dur­ing its trial phase, which be­gan in June this year and will run un­til Fe­bru­ary. More than 200 trainees will take part in the trial.</p>
    <p>“I’m very lucky I got to try the El­fras, so the in­struc­tor knows what I need to im­prove on,” she said.</p>
