    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s cen­tral bank is ex­pected to cut its growth and price fore­casts for the cur­rent fis­cal year at next week’s rate re­view, sources fa­mil­iar with its think­ing said, as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic weighs on the eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>But any such down­grade is un­likely to trig­ger an im­me­di­ate ex­pan­sion of mon­e­tary stim­u­lus, with the Bank of Ja­pan (BOJ) ex­pected to main­tain its as­sump­tion that the world’s third-largest econ­omy will post a mod­er­ate pickup, the sources said.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­what weaker than three months ago,” one of the sources said of this fis­cal year’s growth pro­jec­tions, a view echoed by two other sources.</p>
    <p>The main rea­son for the down­ward re­vi­sion in growth is the big­ger-than-ex­pected eco­nomic slump in April-June and soft con­sump­tion dur­ing the sum­mer, the source said.</p>
    <p>“Risks are skewed to the down­side,” a sec­ond source said, adding that weak ser­vice sec­tor spend­ing and prospects of deeper cuts in cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture cloud the outlook.</p>
    <p>In the most re­cent pro­jec­tion made in July, the BOJ ex­pects the econ­omy to con­tract 4.7 per cent in the cur­rent fis­cal year end­ing March 2021. That is less pes­simistic than a 6 per cent fall pro­jected in this month’s Reuters poll.</p>
    <p>The BOJ’s July fore­casts were com­piled be­fore the re­lease of data that showed the econ­omy shrank an an­nu­alised 28.1 per cent in AprilJune, its worst post-war slump.</p>
    <p>The nine-mem­ber board is also seen trim­ming its inflation fore­cast for the cur­rent fis­cal year, due largely to the im­pact of a gov­ern­ment cam­paign of­fer­ing dis­counts for do­mes­tic travel, the sources said. The BOJ’s cur­rent pro­jec­tion is for core con­sumer prices to fall 0.5 per cent this fis­cal year.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank is widely ex­pected to keep mon­e­tary pol­icy steady at the rate re­view on Oct 28 to 29, when it will also re­lease the fresh quar­terly growth and inflation pro­jec­tions. The board is un­likely to make ma­jor changes to its growth and price fore­casts for fis­cal years end­ing March 2022 and 2023, said the sources, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is grad­u­ally emerg­ing from the sec­ond quar­ter’s steep slump, with ex­ports and out­put pick­ing up, thanks to a re­bound in ve­hi­cle sales and China’s solid re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>But do­mes­tic de­mand re­mains soft with house­hold spend­ing fall­ing for an 11th straight month in Au­gust as de­clin­ing wages keep con­sumers’ purse strings tight.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, big firms plan to raise cap­i­tal spend­ing by just 1.4 per cent in the cur­rent busi­ness year, a quar­terly BOJ sur­vey showed ear­lier this month, lower than a 3.2 per cent in­crease pro­jected in June.</p>
    <p>Many BOJ of­fi­cials ex­pect firms to cut spend­ing plans fur­ther in the com­ing months. Resur­gent in­fec­tions in Europe add to un­cer­tainty for the ex­port-re­liant econ­omy.</p>
    <p>De­spite the risks, the BOJ is in no mood to ramp up stim­u­lus now hav­ing eased pol­icy in March and April, the sources said. Un­der a frame­work cre­ated to cush­ion the blow from the pan­demic, the BOJ now buys huge sums of gov­ern­ment and pri­vate debt. It also of­fers in­cen­tives to fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions that boost lend­ing to smaller firms hit by the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>That frame­work is the first line of de­fence against new strains on the econ­omy, the sources said, sug­gest­ing other steps such as in­ter­est rate cuts will be con­sid­ered only in more ex­treme cir­cum­stances.</p>
