    <p>If you imag­ine hard enough, SYM’s 2020 DRG BT160 might just re­sem­ble a lit­tle dragon. Its up­swept grab rails re­sem­ble tail fins and the front panel has pointed ends which ap­pear like horns.</p>
    <p>DRG stands for drago, or dragon in Ital­ian, but un­for­tu­nately, the 158cc au­to­matic scooter from the Tai­wanese mar­que lacks the abil­ity to breathe fire. But its com­fort and com­po­sure when it goes over bumps def­i­nitely make the rider breathe eas­ier.</p>
    <p>Most scooter­ists will be fa­mil­iar with the jolts and wrig­gling of han­dle­bars, es­pe­cially when rid­ing over pot­holes.</p>
    <p>The DRG, how­ever, be­haves like a big­ger mo­tor­cy­cle equipped with a steer­ing damper or big­ger wheels. Yet, there is no hid­den damper to smoothen the head shakes. Sur­pris­ingly, the liq­uid­cooled DRG has con­ven­tional tele­scopic forks and a di­ag­o­nal­ly­mounted rear shock.</p>
    <p>Its 13-inch alu­minium wheels are slightly big­ger than the 12-inch­ers found on most small scoot­ers.</p>
    <p>The four-stroke DRG stands out from SYM’s sta­ble of util­i­tar­ian scoot­ers with its fun and sporty de­sign and full-LED light­ing.</p>
    <p>Its oddly-shaped dig­i­tal dash­board fea­tures gauges for fuel level, speed, revs and dis­tance. Con­trols on the han­dle­bars are ba­sic and fa­mil­iar. When you thumb the starter, the DRG purrs to life with hardly any vi­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>If you ride the DRG when the sun is di­rectly over­head, the glare from the non-ad­justable dash­board can be a source of ir­ri­ta­tion. And with­out a wind­screen, you have to get used to wind tur­bu­lence.</p>
    <p>The bike’s com­pact na­ture means space is a pre­mium for the rider, with room for only one hel­met un­der the seat. While your knees fit nicely, the limited “floor space” and con­toured rider seat pre­vent you from stretch­ing out on longer com­mutes.</p>
    <p>In the city, the slim-pro­file, 132kg DRG is ideal for stop-go traf­fic and quick lane changes. It is highly ma­noeu­vrable.</p>
    <p>It helps that the DRG has a 50:50 weight dis­tri­bu­tion be­tween its front and rear wheels. The well­bal­anced scooter has a neu­tral feel when poised for cor­ner en­tries.</p>
    <p>It goes around bends with min­i­mal steer­ing in­put and changes di­rec­tion with­out fuss. Also, its 42-de­gree lean an­gle dares you to go deeper into turns.</p>
    <p>The DRG’s per­for­mance fig­ures are hum­ble yet not the low­est in its cat­e­gory. It cruises com­fort­ably be­low 5,000rpm. But keep the rev counter above 6,000rpm, and the scooter ac­cel­er­ates strongly to its 10,000rpm ceil­ing – hit­ting a top speed of slightly above 110kmh.</p>
    <p>The DRG is a joy to ride solo. But take a pil­lion and the ad­di­tional weight re­duces han­dling abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Stop­ping the DRG is done on its anti-lock brakes – the harder you grab the levers, the stronger the brak­ing ac­tion.</p>
    <p>It is a cheap ride too, given its fuel econ­omy of 39.2km per litre of petrol. In the­ory, its 7.4-litre fuel tank, which has a pop-up cap on the panel be­low its han­dle­bars, al­lows you to cover 290km.</p>
    <p>If you are look­ing for a sporty scooter that is in­ex­pen­sive, eco­nom­i­cal and easy to main­tain, this lit­tle dragon could be your ticket.</p>
