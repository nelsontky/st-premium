    <p>WASH­ING­TON US law­mak­ers ham­mered the chief ex­ec­u­tives of Twit­ter, Face­book, Google and one an­other at a Se­nate hear­ing on Wed­nes­day, with Repub­li­cans claim­ing the com­pa­nies were sup­press­ing con­ser­va­tive views while Democrats ac­cused their col­leagues of hold­ing a “sham” hear­ing for po­lit­i­cal gain.</p>
    <p>For nearly four hours, mem­bers of the Com­merce Com­mit­tee pelted Twit­ter’s Jack Dorsey, Face­book’s Mark Zucker­berg and Google’s Sun­dar Pichai with more than 120 ques­tions about so­cial me­dia speech and t he harm caused by their plat­forms, of­ten fram­ing their at­tacks through the lens of next week’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But un­like pre­vi­ous tech hear­ings, this one put the par­ti­san di­vide on full dis­play.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans at­tacked Twit­ter and Face­book for what they said was cen­sor­ship of posts by con­ser­va­tive politi­cians and for down­play­ing a re­cent New York Post ar­ti­cle about Mr Hunter Bi­den, the son of Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“Mr Dorsey, who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the me­dia are al­lowed to re­port and what the Amer­i­can peo­ple are al­lowed to hear?” Se­na­tor Ted Cruz, a Repub­li­can, asked.</p>
    <p>Democrats coun­tered that Repub­li­cans had con­cocted the hear­ing to pres­sure the so­cial me­dia firms into go­ing easy on them be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s a sham,” Se­na­tor Brian Schatz said, while Se­na­tor Amy Klobuchar said Repub­li­cans were politi­cis­ing “what should ac­tu­ally not be a par­ti­san topic”.</p>
    <p>And Se­na­tor Tammy Duck­worth said they were “plac­ing the self­ish in­ter­ests of Don­ald Trump ahead of the health of our democ­racy”.</p>
    <p>The theatrics, which of­ten de­volved into shout­ing, meant that the topic of the hear­ing – the fu­ture of a le­gal shield for on­line plat­forms – was barely de­bated.</p>
    <p>The event had been billed as a dis­cus­sion about Sec­tion 230 of the Com­mu­ni­ca­tions De­cency Act, a law that pro­tects so­cial me­dia firms from li­a­bil­ity for what their users post and is re­garded as sacro­sanct by the plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s ef­forts to take on large tech in re­cent months have largely been bi­par­ti­san.</p>
    <p>Last week, Democrats and Repub­li­cans cheered a Jus­tice Depart­ment law­suit that ac­cused Google of break­ing an­titrust law while pro­tect­ing a mo­nop­oly over its In­ter­net search ser­vice. And law­mak­ers from both par­ties have pushed for new reg­u­la­tions to be ap­plied to the tech com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>But the hear­ing’s barbed ex­changes pointed to how the de­bate over on­line speech has be­come in­creas­ingly di­vided, with the com­pa­nies caught in the mid­dle. Of the 81 ques­tions asked by Repub­li­cans, 69 were about cen­sor­ship and the po­lit­i­cal ide­olo­gies of the tech em­ploy­ees re­spon­si­ble for mod­er­at­ing con­tent, ac­cord­ing to a tally by The New York Times. Democrats asked 48 ques­tions, mostly about reg­u­lat­ing the spread of mis­in­for­ma­tion re­lated to the elec­tion and the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what changes could be made that would sat­isfy ev­ery­one,” said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Jeff Koss­eff, a cy­ber-se­cu­rity law ex­pert at the US Naval Academy. “You’re see­ing two very, very dif­fer­ent world­views.”</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s hear­ing came to­gether af­ter months of protest by Mr Trump and Repub­li­can law­mak­ers over ac­tions by the tech com­pa­nies to la­bel, re­move and limit the reach of posts.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter started la­belling posts by Mr Trump in May for be­ing in­ac­cu­rate and for glo­ri­fy­ing vi­o­lence. Mr Trump re­tal­i­ated that month with an ex­ec­u­tive or­der aimed at strip­ping so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies of the Sec­tion 230 le­gal shield.</p>
    <p>His al­lies in Congress have since piled on, with the Se­nate Com­merce Com­mit­tee’s Repub­li­can lead­er­ship threat­en­ing to sub­poena Mr Dorsey, Mr Zucker­berg and Mr Pichai to dis­cuss Sec­tion 230.</p>
    <p>Democrats, who have been an­gered at the com­pa­nies for al­low­ing hate speech and po­lit­i­cal mis­in­for­ma­tion to spread, also agreed to the hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tive claims of cen­sor­ship on­line are based largely on anec­do­tal ex­am­ples of right-wing com­men­ta­tors or law­mak­ers whose con­tent was mod­er­ated by so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>But many con­ser­va­tive per­son­al­i­ties have built enor­mous au­di­ences on the plat­forms, and law­mak­ers did not of­fer ev­i­dence that sys­temic bias was built into the com­pa­nies’ prod­ucts.</p>
