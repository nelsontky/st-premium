    <p>Af­ter months of po­lit­i­cal grand­stand­ing in Wash­ing­ton, the open­ing shot has fi­nally been fired in the bat­tle to re­strain Big Tech.</p>
    <p>In a com­plaint against Google last week, backed by the Repub­li­can at­tor­neys-gen­eral of 11 US states, the Depart­ment of Jus­tice (DOJ) ended years of in­ac­tion on the part of the United States an­titrust au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The com­plaint re­ceived re­sound­ing sup­port from the com­pany’s op­po­nents. It has landed at a time when there is rare bi­par­ti­san po­lit­i­cal sup­port for ac­tion. And it re­flects a care­ful le­gal strat­egy de­signed to max­imise the odds of suc­cess, while also act­ing as the first part of a broader le­gal cam­paign against both Google and the rest of Big Tech.</p>
    <p>The will­ing­ness of the au­thor­i­ties in Wash­ing­ton to re­ally take on Big Tech will be­come ap­par­ent only af­ter the elec­tion bat­tle between Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Mr Joe Bi­den. But the broad po­lit­i­cal sup­port in Wash­ing­ton for last week’s ac­tion helped to set the stage for other cases against large tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Trade Com­mis­sion has been in­ves­ti­gat­ing Face­book along­side sev­eral states, and peo­ple in­volved in that case ex­pect it to be filed be­fore the end of the year. Fed­eral in­ves­ti­ga­tors have also opened probes into both Ama­zon and Ap­ple. “We are look­ing at a once-in-a-cen­tury op­por­tu­nity to re­align what the po­lit­i­cal economy of the US should look like,” says Wash­ing­ton-based Open Mar­kets In­sti­tute founder Barry Lynn.</p>
    <p>The Google law­suit is not quite the am­bi­tious at­tempt to stretch the bound­aries of an­titrust law that some crit­ics of the dig­i­tal giants had hoped for. In­stead, the DOJ has opted for a more lim­ited and tra­di­tional an­titrust ac­tion that many lawyers be­lieve has a bet­ter chance of win­ning.</p>
    <p>Mr Srid­har Ra­maswamy, a for­mer head of ad­ver­tis­ing at Google who is launch­ing a new search en­gine, was among those to wel­come the lim­ited nature of the case. “One of the real fears I have is, how do we get the word out there is an op­tion, so that peo­ple can ever con­sider us?” he says. The US ac­tion is “straight and nar­row, and a re­ally im­por­tant case. It gives me heart.”</p>
    <p>NET­WORKS EF­FECTS</p>
    <p>Much of the crit­i­cism from politi­cians of both Google and for other big tech com­pa­nies has cen­tred on the way they wield their plat­form power.</p>
    <p>In a sweep­ing re­port from a House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives sub­com­mit­tee last month, the com­pa­nies were ac­cused of chan­nelling users from their dom­i­nant search en­gines, app stores and e-com­merce sites to their other ser­vices, de­lib­er­ately cut­ting out com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, the DOJ’s open­ing salvo is aimed at a far more lim­ited is­sue: The con­tracts Google em­ploys to en­sure its search en­gine stays promi­nently in front of users. These in­clude pay­ing bil­lions of dol­lars to Ap­ple and oth­ers to make it the de­fault search en­gine on most smart­phones.</p>
    <p>It also stands ac­cused of us­ing a se­ries of con­trac­tual ar­range­ments to make sure it keeps pole po­si­tion on phones run­ning its own An­droid op­er­at­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Com­ing years af­ter Google turned its search en­gine into the cen­tre­piece of an ar­ray of widely used and self-re­in­forc­ing ser­vices, from Maps to Gmail, there are also se­ri­ous ques­tions about how any sin­gle le­gal case could loosen its grip. An of­fi­cial at one Google ri­val summed up the frus­tra­tion: “It’s too damned late.”</p>
    <p>The case is un­likely to get to court be­fore 2022. With pos­si­ble ap­peals, re­lief could be years away, even if the US were to win.</p>
    <p>By lim­it­ing it­self to the com­pany’s con­tracts, it could be the clos­est thing to an open-and-shut case, says Mr Gary Re­back, a US an­titrust lawyer who spent years rep­re­sent­ing Amer­i­can com­pa­nies fight­ing Google in Brussels and Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“If they had gone af­ter other parts of Google’s business, they would have got caught up in ques­tions like how they should de­fine the mar­ket Google op­er­ates in,” says Mr Gene Kim­mel­man, a for­mer se­nior an­titrust of­fi­cial at the DOJ. “For ex­am­ple, with ad­ver­tis­ing, there would have been ques­tions on whether Face­book should be counted as a com­peti­tor, or whether the part of the business deal­ing with ad­ver­tis­ers should be counted as sep­a­rate from that deal­ing with pub­lish­ers.”</p>
    <p>Google, for its part, called the law­suit “deeply flawed”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the DOJ, the case is modelled closely on the agency’s suc­cess­ful an­titrust ac­tion against Mi­crosoft two decades ago. But Google re­jects the com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>To­day’s users can switch between search en­gines far more eas­ily than users of Mi­crosoft’s Win­dows soft­ware could pick a Web browser other than In­ter­net Ex­plorer, the com­pany ar­gues. It adds that, un­like Mi­crosoft, it had not im­posed ex­clu­sive con­tracts that forced dis­trib­u­tors to shut out its ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Mr Kent Walker, Google’s se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of global af­fairs, com­pares the huge sums it pays to search dis­trib­u­tors – amount­ing to US$30 bil­lion (S$41 bil­lion) glob­ally last year – to the money that mak­ers of break­fast ce­re­als pay to get the best shelf space in a su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to op­po­nents, that fails to re­flect the re­al­ity of how peo­ple use mod­ern dig­i­tal ser­vices, and switch­ing a search en­gine is not like reach­ing for a dif­fer­ent brand of corn­flakes on a lower shelf. “The re­al­ity is that 99 per cent of peo­ple are not go­ing to change their de­faults,” says Mr Ra­maswamy.</p>
    <p>Rather than oc­cu­py­ing only a slice of prime shelf space, Google has guar­an­teed its search en­gine al­most ubiq­ui­tous ex­po­sure. “It’s like they bought ev­ery store in the neigh­bour­hood,” says Mr Re­back.</p>
    <p>The com­bined ef­fect of all its con­tracts is a text­book case of try­ing to block op­po­nents, he says, adding that if con­sumers could switch so eas­ily but chose to use Google any­way, then why would it pay such huge amounts for the best place­ment?</p>
    <p>How­ever, some an­titrust ex­perts say it is un­likely that a court would try to block what look like open com­mer­cial ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple and other com­pa­nies seem to have a per­fect right to auc­tion off the de­fault po­si­tions in their de­vices to the high­est bid­der, says law pro­fes­sor Ran­dal Picker at the Univer­sity of Chicago, adding that it would not be “an easy case to win” for the DOJ.</p>
    <p>PO­LIT­I­CAL MOVES</p>
    <p>Fur­ther law­suits against Google look al­most cer­tain to fol­low.</p>
    <p>A group of state A-Gs, who have had a par­al­lel in­ves­ti­ga­tion and who did not join the DOJ’s case, said last Tues­day they were plan­ning to file their own suit in the com­ing weeks, and that this would prob­a­bly be ap­pended to that of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Most ob­servers ex­pect the case to broaden out fur­ther as the pre-trial pe­riod con­tin­ues. Ad­ver­tis­ing tech­nol­ogy might yet come un­der scru­tiny, as might Google’s prac­tice of putting its own prod­ucts – such as Google travel and shop­ping – at the top of search re­sults. “It would not be sur­pris­ing to see ad­di­tional suits filed by the state A-Gs or by the DOJ that are broader,” says Mr Michael Kades, di­rec­tor for com­pe­ti­tion pol­icy at the Wash­ing­ton Cen­tre for Eq­ui­table Growth.</p>
    <p>If Wash­ing­ton’s le­gal strat­egy for tak­ing on Big Tech is start­ing to come into fo­cus, the tim­ing of the first le­gal ac­tion has con­founded many. Com­ing only two weeks be­fore a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, it has left many ques­tion­ing whether the case was rushed through for max­i­mum po­lit­i­cal im­pact. By pre-empt­ing the re­sults of the sep­a­rate in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the states, it has also robbed reg­u­la­tors of a chance to present a more united front.</p>
    <p>Some in­volved in the state A-Gs’ case still felt they had work to do. “They were only weeks away from be­ing ready,” said the per­son. “The only rea­son to push the but­ton now was to get it out be­fore the elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>The progress of the case may now turn on the out­come of the elec­tion. Com­pared with other se­nior Democrats, Mr Bi­den has said rel­a­tively lit­tle about what he thinks about cor­po­rate power in the tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try; some on the left worry he will con­tinue for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s friendly stance to­wards Sil­i­con Val­ley.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, how­ever, be­lieve Mr</p>
    <p>Bi­den will not want to look weak in tack­ling cor­po­rate power in com­par­i­son with Repub­li­cans, and will push ahead with the case.</p>
    <p>“I would ex­pect a new ad­min­is­tra­tion to want their own peo­ple to be in charge to tackle such a high-pro­file and im­por­tant law­suit,” says Mr Kim­mel­man.</p>
    <p>“That will take time, but there is no rea­son it shouldn’t con­tinue.”</p>
    <p>For Mr Re­back, the most im­por­tant ques­tion is whether fu­ture lead­ers push ag­gres­sively for se­ri­ous sanc­tions against the tech com­pa­nies, or if they set­tle in re­turn for rel­a­tively mi­nor be­havioural changes, as the Ge­orge W. Bush White House did with Mi­crosoft in 2001.</p>
    <p>Mr Ryan Shores, as­so­ciate deputy at­tor­ney-gen­eral, would not say what out­come he wanted, but in­sisted: “Noth­ing is off the ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>The betting on Wall Street was that any ac­tion would be lim­ited, and shares in Google’s par­ent, Al­pha­bet, did not lose value. A sim­i­lar case in Europe, launched in 2016, led to rel­a­tively mi­nor con­tract changes, along with a move to give users a choice of search en­gines. Nei­ther mea­sure has done any­thing to weaken Google’s grip on search.</p>
    <p>A more dra­co­nian step would be to bar Google from buy­ing up the best shelf space. But given the huge pay­ments it cur­rently makes, that could pro­voke wide­spread op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>As a Google of­fi­cial says, it would not go down well with the many com­pa­nies that ben­e­fit from the cur­rent ar­range­ments – start­ing with Ap­ple, but in­clud­ing other hand­set mak­ers, browser com­pa­nies and mo­bile net­work op­er­a­tors that share in Google’s ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enues in re­turn for pro­mot­ing its ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to some of Google’s foes, that leaves a break-up as the surest way to cre­ate a more open search mar­ket. Europe’s fail­ure to rein in Google af­ter fight­ing the same bat­tle shows that this is the only sanc­tion that will work, says Mr Thomas Vinje, the lawyer whose com­plaint prod­ded Brussels to take on An­droid’s ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>“The only re­ally ef­fec­tive rem­edy would be forc­ing Google to di­vest An­droid,” he says. “The sep­a­rate com­pany wouldn’t have the in­cen­tive to lever­age An­droid to ben­e­fit search.”</p>
    <p>For now, it is sim­ply “too early to know” whether there will be po­lit­i­cal back­ing in Wash­ing­ton for break­ing up Google or other tech com­pa­nies, says Mr Roger McNamee, a Sil­i­con Val­ley in­vestor and for­mer ally of Face­book who has since be­come one of Big Tech’s harsh­est crit­ics.</p>
    <p>But while the endgame may still be years away, last week’s law­suit shows that some­thing pro­found has changed in US an­titrust.</p>
    <p>“The lais­sez-faire, low-touch pol­icy that has ex­isted for the last 40 years is giv­ing way,” Mr McNamee says. “The ques­tion is, how far will they go?”</p>
