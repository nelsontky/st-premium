    <p>LONDON • Ham­mers man­ager David Moyes has nailed work­ing from home. As he missed an­other game from the side­lines yes­ter­day – his fourth in a row fol­low­ing his pos­i­tive Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis – his side served up the best treat­ment.</p>
    <p>West Ham shat­tered Le­ices­ter’s un­beaten start to the Premier League sea­son with a sur­prise 3-0 win, fol­low­ing up on their 4-0 rout of Wolves in their pre­vi­ous topflight game.</p>
    <p>Goals f rom Michail An­to­nio, Pablo For­nals and Jar­rod Bowen en­sured the Ham­mers have won three of their four matches since Moyes’ pos­i­tive test last month.</p>
    <p>The re­sult brought sec­ond­placed Le­ices­ter back down to earth as their three-game win­ning run came to an end at the King Power Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“I had hoped to be back with the squad for to­day’s fix­ture but I’m not quite ready to re­turn just yet,”</p>
    <p>Moyes told West Ham’s web­site be­fore kick-off.</p>
    <p>“I’m feel­ing gen­er­ally fine but I have had some mild symp­toms, so we are tak­ing it day by day and fol­low­ing the ad­vice of the med­i­cal ex­perts.”</p>
    <p>Alan Irvine again man­aged from the dugout, while Moyes, watch­ing at home on tele­vi­sion, li­aised with as­sis­tant Stu­art Pearce by phone.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors took the lead in the 14th minute. Hav­ing won a free­kick when he was fouled by Caglar Soyuncu, An­to­nio made a well­timed run to the far post, where he headed home from Aaron Cress­well’s pin­point cross.</p>
    <p>West Ham dou­bled their lead in the 34th minute, with For­nals fir­ing past Kasper Sch­me­ichel for his first goal since Fe­bru­ary and with seven minutes left, Bowen slot­ted home from For­nals’ pass.</p>
    <p>The home side’s mis­er­able af­ter­noon was summed up when Jamie Vardy missed a 90th-minute sit­ter be­fore Har­vey Barnes had a stop­page-time goal scrapped by the video as­sis­tant ref­eree for off­side.</p>
    <p>“It was pretty much the per­fect per­for­mance,” said Irvine. “It would be very dif­fi­cult for us to look back at that game and pick too many faults, so we’re ab­so­lutely delighted with the way the team played from start to fin­ish.”</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter were bereft of ideas, fail­ing to muster a sin­gle shot on tar­get and Brendan Rodgers con­ceded they were out­played in ev­ery de­part­ment.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing was miss­ing – it was poor,” said the Foxes man­ager. “We started the sea­son well and scored goals but we lacked ag­gres­sion in our de­fend­ing and West Ham have shown they are a good side.”</p>
