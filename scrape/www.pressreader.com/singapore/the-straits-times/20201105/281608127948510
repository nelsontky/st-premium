    <p>Who­ever wins the United States pres­i­den­tial election will be leading a coun­try even more deeply di­vided than be­fore the na­tion went to the polls.</p>
    <p>The nar­row­ness of the con­test, with sup­port for the can­di­dates sta­tis­ti­cally split al­most evenly down the mid­dle, shows how danger­ously deep and per­sis­tent the US’ in­ter­nal di­vi­sions are.</p>
    <p>A land­slide, or even a de­ci­sive vic­tory ei­ther way, would have demon­strated a clear ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans on one side or another. But the coun­try’s next pres­i­dent faces di­vi­sions that will dog the US in­ter­nally, poi­son­ing na­tional dis­cus­sions and even, in a pes­simistic sce­nario, threat­en­ing to tear the na­tion apart.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore this election, each side thought the other would cheat to win. That view has only been ce­mented. And in the in­terim power strug­gle, likely to be played out in the courts, the po­ten­tial for un­rest in the streets is also higher.</p>
    <p>One stand­out dif­fer­ence from 2016 is the in­ten­sity of pas­sions on ei­ther side. In 2016, the White House was not sur­rounded by high fences, and no shops and restau­rants in downtown Wash­ing­ton or other ma­jor cities were boarded up in an­tic­i­pa­tion of ri­ot­ing.</p>
    <p>“Looks like Bi­den wins. Trump doesn’t con­cede. And nearly half the pop­u­la­tion thinks the out­come is il­le­git­i­mate,” Mr Ian Brem­mer, pres­i­dent of the Eura­sia Group tweeted the morn­ing after – even as a Joe Bi­den vic­tory still looked far from cer­tain.</p>
    <p>The out­come thus far also re­flects the asym­me­try that de­fines the po­lit­i­cal di­vide.</p>
    <p>Polls show that Repub­li­cans, and par­tic­u­larly Trump sup­port­ers, place the economy at the top of their con­cerns. The Pres­i­dent’s prom­ise of lower taxes would cer­tainly have played into that.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic and cli­mate change are lower down on Repub­li­cans’ list of con­cerns.</p>
    <p>For Democrats, it is the op­po­site – the pan­demic is a top con­cern. So is cli­mate change. The economy is not top of the list.</p>
    <p>Even so, across the board, Mr Trump scored bet­ter on the economy than Mr Bi­den. The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent scored</p>
    <p>The nar­row­ness of the con­test, with sup­port for the can­di­dates sta­tis­ti­cally split al­most evenly down the mid­dle, shows how danger­ously deep and per­sis­tent the United States’ in­ter­nal di­vi­sions are. A land­slide, or even a de­ci­sive vic­tory ei­ther way, would have demon­strated a clear ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans on one side or another. But the coun­try’s next pres­i­dent faces di­vi­sions that will dog the US in­ter­nally, poi­son­ing na­tional dis­cus­sions and even, in a pes­simistic sce­nario, threat­en­ing to tear the na­tion apart.</p>
    <p>bet­ter on man­age­ment of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There is also the ques­tion of Pres­i­dent Trump’s per­son­al­ity and track record. Mul­ti­ple Trump sup­port­ers in the days be­fore the election told The Straits Times they ap­pre­ci­ated that the Pres­i­dent kept his prom­ises.</p>
    <p>They were will­ing to give him a pass on his han­dling of the pan­demic, say­ing that no pres­i­dent could have done any bet­ter.</p>
    <p>And while many said they some­times cringed at Mr Trump’s abra­sive style, they ap­pre­ci­ated his authen­tic­ity and di­rect­ness, com­pared with the du­plic­ity and disin­gen­u­ous­ness of the usual Wash­ing­ton politi­cian.</p>
    <p>In short, the Pres­i­dent’s odds-de­fy­ing per­for­mance again demon­strates the ap­peal of his pop­ulist, strong­man per­sona and mav­er­ick ap­proach to his in­tensely loyal base – which could po­ten­tially carry this election.</p>
    <p>One clear ca­su­alty of the process has been public opin­ion polling, which in 2016 also missed a late swing against then Demo­cratic con­tender Hil­lary Clin­ton. An­a­lysts also blame par­ti­san me­dia for am­pli­fy­ing bi­ases.</p>
    <p>“A pres­i­dent trail­ing his op­po­nent by close to 10 points go­ing into election day should be con­sid­ered a de­cided un­der­dog,” said the Cook Po­lit­i­cal Re­port.</p>
    <p>“There’s no doubt that ex­pec­ta­tions were a lot higher than what the re­al­ity turned out to be,” the po­lit­i­cal polling or­gan­i­sa­tion ac­knowl­edged.</p>
    <p>Opin­ions of the Pres­i­dent have not moved much at all. The pan­demic did not have any ef­fect on Mr Trump’s sup­port, though it re­flected for the Democrats in the higher early vot­ing and mail-in bal­lots – which as at yes­ter­day morn­ing re­mained cru­cial to the out­come in a cou­ple of key states the party con­tin­ues to be­lieve will de­liver Mr Bi­den a win.</p>
    <p>The US’ ur­ban-ru­ral di­vide also re­mains en­trenched, although pre­lim­i­nary anal­y­sis shows the Pres­i­dent may have slightly im­proved his per­for­mance in big cities. “In states like Ohio and</p>
    <p>Iowa, Trump’s strength in ru­ral/small-town Amer­ica helped him,” the Cook Po­lit­i­cal Re­port said.</p>
    <p>For Mr Bi­den, win­ning the election in these cir­cum­stances, pos­si­bly via bat­tling law­suits, in an in­creas­ingly tribal po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment, will chal­lenge his abil­ity to unify the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Who­ever emerges the win­ner, will not be able to re­al­is­ti­cally claim a ring­ing en­dorse­ment from a ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans.</p>
