    <p>It has taken a whole-of-so­ci­ety ef­fort to win the Unesco recog­ni­tion for hawker cul­ture. It will take an­other whole-of-so­ci­ety ef­fort to sus­tain this and keep hawker cul­ture thriv­ing.</p>
    <p>This is im­por­tant to bear in mind, as the na­tion cel­e­brates the ad­di­tion of hawker cul­ture to the Unesco Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of the In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity. Hawker cul­ture joins over 460 items on the list of such her­itage world­wide. Other items range from oral tra­di­tions and food prepa­ra­tion meth­ods, to the craft of millers who main­tain wind­mills in the Nether­lands, and yoga in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture won recog­ni­tion for its unique blend of of­fer­ing a di­verse range of her­itage food at af­ford­able prices, within com­mu­nity din­ing rooms that draw din­ers across race and class di­vides, set within a highly ur­banised en­vi­ron­ment. It is the en­tire ecosys­tem that leads to hawker cul­ture that mer­ited in­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>To be sure, such recog­ni­tion is an im­plicit en­dorse­ment of our hawker fare, which forms a crit­i­cal part of hawker cul­ture. But hawker cul­ture goes be­yond the de­li­cious food we all en­joy at hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>So what would it take to sus­tain hawker cul­ture go­ing for­ward?</p>
    <p>Win­ning this recog­ni­tion is it­self a com­mit­ment to keep­ing that cul­ture alive, be­cause Sin­ga­pore now has to sub­mit a re­port ev­ery six years to Unesco to show ef­forts made to safe­guard and trans­mit hawker cul­ture to fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Sus­tain­ing hawker cul­ture will re­quire ef­forts from all bod­ies con­cerned. From the gov­ern­ment sec­tor, the role of the National En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA), as the lead agency reg­u­lat­ing and man­ag­ing hawker cen­tres, is cru­cial. It has to work with other stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing hawk­ers and hawker cen­tre op­er­a­tors, to make sure be­ing a hawker re­mains a sus­tain­able busi­ness that at­tracts younger gen­er­a­tions. This is a crit­i­cal part of sus­tain­ing hawker cul­ture and by no means as­sured.</p>
    <p>While cel­e­brat­ing the win, many Sin­ga­pore­ans will re­mem­ber that the Gov­ern­ment had in fact halted the build­ing of hawker cen­tres for 26 years, and only in 2011 did it an­nounce it would re­sume build­ing new cen­tres. There re­mains a con­cern that hawker cen­tres and hawker food are con­sid­ered a trou­ble­some “wicked” prob­lem (so called for be­ing hard to solve) the state is happy to out­source to ex­ter­nal hawker cen­tre op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>The Unesco award raises the stakes on this is­sue. An in­ter-min­istry task force is sorely needed to ad­dress this wicked prob­lem at its root cause. The fun­da­men­tal dilemma is this: how to keep hawker fare af­ford­able for the masses while mak­ing the hawker trade at­trac­tive enough fi­nan­cially to at­tract a new gen­er­a­tion of hawk­ers? Low hawker food prices de­press hawk­ers’ prof­its; high prof­its re­quire higher prices.</p>
    <p>This ba­sic is­sue has to be tack­led. Oth­er­wise if few new hawk­ers en­ter the trade, it would be em­bar­rass­ing, to say the least, to be recog­nised for some­thing that fades away af­ter one gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>NEA plays an im­por­tant role, mean­while, to sus­tain the hawker trade. It has to step up and relook ef­forts to keep costs down. It has to look at rental, clean­ing and dish­wash­ing costs, and help drive economies of scale. It has to roll up its sleeves and work more closely with hawker as­so­ci­a­tions to reap such economies.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple: A cur­rent drive to get hawk­ers to ac­cept e-pay­ments is un­der way – which is good as far as it goes. It would be far bet­ter to help hawk­ers get onto de­liv­ery plat­forms as that will ex­pand their cus­tomer base sig­nif­i­cantly. This re­quires sign­ing up hawk­ers one at a time, which is painstak­ing work. But as Covid-19 proved, many old-school hawk­ers can and did adapt to the dig­i­tal world. Many more can do so with in­di­vid­ual help.</p>
    <p>But it is not just the Gov­ern­ment’s job to sus­tain hawker cul­ture. Each of us has a role. What can in­di­vid­u­als do?</p>
    <p>One: Eat at hawker cen­tres of­ten. Tar pau (take away) hawker food reg­u­larly. Take your chil­dren, so they grow up used to such ex­pe­ri­ences and learn to love our hawker food and hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Two: Don’t whine when the price of a cup of cof­fee goes up by 10 cents or a bowl of noo­dle goes up by 50 cents, un­less you are re­ally in fi­nan­cial hard­ship and the ex­tra cost eats into your monthly bud­get. Pay up and be proud to sup­port the liveli­hoods of the thou­sands of hawk­ers who de­vote years to hon­ing their craft and work long hours to bring you their fare. Most have chil­dren or other de­pen­dants to sup­port too.</p>
    <p>My late par­ents were hawk­ers who sold char kway teow. When they re­tired in the 1990s, they could have passed on their sub­sidised stall to the chil­dren. All three of us said no unan­i­mously. We had all been help­ing out at the stall since school days and ex­pe­ri­enced how hard the work was and seen how low the earn­ings were.</p>
    <p>If hawk­ers can earn higher prof­its and have bet­ter so­cial stature, maybe more hawk­ers’ chil­dren will want to con­tinue the fam­ily trade. Their prof­itabil­ity de­pends on how much we are all pre­pared to pay for our hawker fare.</p>
    <p>Apart from sup­port­ing hawker cul­ture by eat­ing at hawker cen­tres of­ten, we can also help main­tain the en­vi­ron­ment there.</p>
    <p>Ms Grace Fu, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, pledged that the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to sup­port hawk­ers to sus­tain their hawker trade. She then urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to do their part “to main­tain the hy­gienic and safe din­ing en­vi­ron­ment at our hawker cen­tres, by re­turn­ing used crock­ery and trays and keep­ing the ta­bles clean”.</p>
    <p>Third way to help sus­tain hawker cul­ture: Keep ta­bles clean.</p>
    <p>Many hawker cen­tres have messy ta­bles, with food de­bris and used plates left on ta­bles af­ter din­ers leave. Pi­geons and my­nahs swoop down on the left­overs.</p>
    <p>As Mr Liak Teng Lit, who used to chair the Pub­lic Hy­giene Coun­cil, notes, it would be a shame­ful thing for tourists to come to Sin­ga­pore to en­joy its Unesco-win­ning hawker cul­ture, to be con­fronted with such sights. Sin­ga­porean pa­trons, es­pe­cially younger ones, will also be turned off by such dirty cen­tres.</p>
    <p>On a walk-through re­cently at a hawker cen­tre with me, he pointed out dirty ta­bles and stained walls. When a cou­ple who had fin­ished eat­ing stood up, leav­ing their tray of used crock­ery be­hind, Mr Liak ap­proached them and po­litely pointed to the tray re­turn sta­tion. A short con­ver­sa­tion en­sued in which he urged them to re­turn their trays, even if oth­ers did not.</p>
    <p>The self-ap­pointed pub­lic hy­giene am­bas­sador does this of­ten.</p>
    <p>As at March 27 last year, when the nom­i­na­tion doc­u­ments were sub­mit­ted, Sin­ga­pore­ans had given more than 850,000 pledges of sup­port and over 31,000 mes­sages across var­i­ous plat­forms, from web­sites to cards. (I am a mem­ber of the nom­i­na­tion com­mit­tee over­see­ing this ef­fort, work­ing with the National Her­itage Board, NEA and the Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore.)</p>
    <p>Hawker cul­ture clearly wins sup­port across broad seg­ments of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety. All of us who pledged our sup­port need to do our bit now to sus­tain it – and that in­cludes eat­ing at hawker cen­tres of­ten, clean­ing up the ta­ble af­ter we dine and putting trays away.</p>
    <p>Each of us can be a hawker cul­ture am­bas­sador in our own way.</p>
