    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Play­ing fa­mous peo­ple comes with myr­iad chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tress Gil­lian An­der­son had it tougher than most when she took on the role of for­mer Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Mar­garet Thatcher in the new sea­son of The Crown (2016 to present) with­out any spe­cial ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Mrs Thatcher en­ters the Net­flix tele­vi­sion se­ries por­tray­ing the Bri­tish royal fam­ily as it moves into the 1980s, when the po­lar­is­ing Con­ser­va­tive Party leader was at the height of her power.</p>
    <p>An­der­son, 52, did not use pros­thet­ics, not even teeth, but re­lied on body lan­guage and vo­cal idio­syn­cra­sies to cap­ture Mrs Thatcher’s ap­pear­ance for her role (above).</p>
    <p>“It came down to hold­ing my mouth in the right way,” An­der­son said. “Then she had very spe­cific man­ner­isms in terms of how she cocks her head and how she leans for­ward. You start putting those things to­gether and, at some point, you end up i n the realm of Mar­garet Thatcher.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Thatcher was Bri­tain’s first fe­male prime min­is­ter and her 11-year term in of­fice from 1979 to 1990 was the long­est of the 20th cen­tury. She died aged 87 in 2013.</p>
    <p>The new sea­son of The Crown, to be re­leased on Net­flix on Sun­day, cov­ers the es­ca­la­tion of con­flict in North­ern Ire­land and the Falk­lands War. It will also por­tray the un­happy mar­riage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, who will be played by Emma Cor­rin.</p>
    <p>An­der­son said the first time she ran into Cor­rin, when both ac­tors were in full cos­tume, “was kind of like a Madame Tus­sauds mo­ment”.</p>
    <p>An­der­son, who grew up in both Bri­tain and the United States and is best known for tele­vi­sion’s The X Files (1993 to 2018), had plenty of ma­te­rial to work with to cap­ture Mrs Thatcher.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple have played her to ac­claim be­fore, so that’s al­ways a bit daunt­ing,” she said, re­fer­ring to the likes of ac­tress Meryl Streep, an Os­car winner for The Iron Lady (2011).</p>
    <p>“Also, she’s cer­tainly quite a char­ac­ter and peo­ple had very strong opin­ions about her ei­ther way. There is so much rich­ness of char­ac­ter and his­tory that as an ac­tor you can bite into,” An­der­son added.</p>
