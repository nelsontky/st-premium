    <p>The her­itage com­mu­nity and prop­erty de­vel­op­ers cheered yes­ter­day’s move to pave the way for the iconic Golden Mile Com­plex to be con­served, say­ing that it is a win­win for both of them.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity has cou­pled the pro­posed con­ser­va­tion with ad­di­tional plan­ning in­cen­tives to at­tract de­vel­op­ers in a fu­ture col­lec­tive sale.</p>
    <p>Dr Yeo Kang Shua, pres­i­dent of the In­ter­na­tional Coun­cil on Mon­u­ments and Sites, Sin­ga­pore, said it is an un­prece­dented move by the Gov­ern­ment to take the first step to pro­pose con­ser­va­tion for a large build­ing that is not state-owned.</p>
    <p>“To me, it sig­nals the Gov­ern­ment is start­ing to look at what makes up our uniquely postin­de­pen­dence Sin­ga­porean iden­tity and his­tory,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Yeo noted that mod­ern build­ings like Golden Mile Com­plex, which was com­pleted in 1973, are the most vul­ner­a­ble to de­mo­li­tion as they are some­times not deemed wor­thy of con­ser­va­tion ow­ing to their rel­a­tively young age.</p>
    <p>“They are too close to us in terms of age to be associated with her­itage, so peo­ple don’t hes­i­tate to de­mol­ish them.</p>
    <p>“But this move may now help re-eval­u­ate the his­tor­i­cal and ar­chi­tec­tural merit of mod­ern build­ings,” he said.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate con­sul­tancy firm Show­suite’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Karamjit Singh said of­fer­ing ad­di­tional plan­ning in­cen­tives is a prag­matic strat­egy to en­tice de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of the frag­mented own­er­ship, the in­cen­tives need to be cal­i­brated to make its en bloc sale vi­able for both build­ing own­ers and de­vel­oper. From the buyer’s per­spec­tive, re­fur­bish­ing an old build­ing tends to be more cum­ber­some than build­ing afresh and un­con­strained,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Des­mond Sim of CBRE said: “From a plan­ning per­spec­tive, if sold, this could also spear­head the re­ju­ve­na­tion ef­forts in the Beach Road area, which is in line with the Gov­ern­ment’s vi­sion to re­vi­talise the area.”</p>
