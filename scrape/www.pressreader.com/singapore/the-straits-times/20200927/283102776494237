    <p>Diver­si­fy­ing his port­fo­lio forms the back­bone of Mr Liu Feng-Yuan’s in­vest­ment strat­egy.</p>
    <p>This di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion is use­ful in help­ing him stay in­vested for the long term and avoid­ing short-term risks and pit­falls, he adds.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu, 38, is the chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence start-up Ba­sisAI, which aims to build re­spon­si­ble ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>It was founded in 2018 and re­ceived around $8.2 mil­lion in seed fund­ing from Te­masek and Se­quoia Cap­i­tal, in one of the largest seed rounds raised by a Sin­ga­pore startup.</p>
    <p>The firm is now a team of 20. It is fo­cus­ing on prod­uct de­vel­op­ment and iden­ti­fy­ing prod­ucts that fit the mar­ket at this stage.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu said: “We’re look­ing to scale the adop­tion of our pro­pri­etary AI plat­form, Bedrock, within sec­tors such as fi­nan­cial ser­vices, tel­cos and health­care.”</p>
    <p>Bedrock is a ma­chine learn­ing plat­form that en­ables en­ter­prises to build and scale re­spon­si­ble AI sys­tems that are more trans­par­ent, ex­plain­able and fair.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu, who pre­vi­ously held ap­point­ments in the pub­lic ser­vice, such as at GovTech, the Land Trans­port Author­ity and the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try, grad­u­ated from Ox­ford Uni­ver­sity with a mas­ter’s in phi­los­o­phy, pol­i­tics and eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>He also holds a mas­ter’s in eco­nom­ics from the Lon­don School of Eco­nom­ics and Po­lit­i­cal Sci­ence.</p>
    <p>His wife, 36, works at Ama­zon Web Ser­vices as the head of pub­lic pol­icy for Sin­ga­pore and Asean strate­gic projects, and they have a son who is around 11/ years old and</p>
    <p>2 a new­born daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>A I in­vest us­ing En­dowus, an on­line plat­form that al­lows me to in­vest in mu­tual funds. I spec­i­fied an 80-20 al­lo­ca­tion ra­tio be­tween eq­uity and bonds, and En­dowus rec­om­mends the funds, which are a com­bi­na­tion of Di­men­sional World Eq­uity Fund, Pimco GIS Global Bond Fund and Pimco GIS Emerg­ing Mar­kets Bond Fund.</p>
    <p>I picked pas­sively man­aged funds to keep costs low and be­cause I be­lieve I don’t know enough to be able to pick the best ac­tive fund man­agers. In­stead, I in­tend to stay in­vested and di­ver­si­fied to reap longterm re­turns.</p>
    <p>I ac­tu­ally try to ig­nore the av­er­age an­nual re­turns. The phi­los­o­phy I take is to in­vest for the long term and stay in­vested in a di­ver­si­fied port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Long-term com­pound growth will out­weigh short-term fluc­tu­a­tions, so I want to avoid even think</p>
    <p>ing about short-term fluc­tu­a­tions and look­ing at my re­turns lest it leads to emo­tional weak­ness. It’s about mak­ing sure the ra­tio­nal side of me wins out.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A My plan is to con­tinue to de­vote a per­cent­age of my in­come to a di­ver­si­fied port­fo­lio. I’ve au­to­mated the process to in­vest a fixed amount ev­ery month so that I don’t have to think about it.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A I was em­bark­ing on a start-up, which meant a sig­nif­i­cant re­duc­tion in my take-home pay, and at the same time I had a new­born. I re­ally started to think about plan­ning for re­tire­ment and the child’s ed­u­ca­tion, so that was the real im­pe­tus for be­ing more de­lib­er­ate about in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>My first in­vest­ment was ac­tu­ally a gift from my late father. He bought me into a few mu­tual funds as I did well for my O lev­els in 1998.</p>
    <p>My late father prob­a­bly also did this be­cause it was in the af­ter­math of the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis and as a banker, he knew stocks were un­der</p>
    <p>val­ued. The in­vest­ment was into one of the Ab­erdeen unit trusts for Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and Thai­land. We haven’t touched it since and I think the value of the in­vest­ment has tripled.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy</p>
    <p>A It is di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion, be­cause I don’t have time to un­der­stand in­di­vid­ual stocks and the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>I read The In­tel­li­gent In­vestor by Ben­jamin Gra­ham many years ago and I sup­pose I was in­flu­enced by that. And also, I stud­ied eco­nom­ics, so I be­lieve in the ef­fi­cient-mar­ket hy­poth­e­sis and that it’s hard to beat the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>I was also very con­vinced by Di­men­sional’s an­nual pub­li­ca­tions, which show visu­ally the per­for­mance of as­set classes over short and very long time pe­ri­ods. It showed that over a 20-year time hori­zon, in­vest­ment re­turns are much more con­sis­tent than over shorter time pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan? A About a year ago, my wife and I went to see the good peo­ple at Prov­i­dend, who are fi­nan­cial plan­ners. They helped us put ev­ery­thing to­gether and also de­vel­oped a plan tai­lored to our needs.</p>
    <p>It con­sid­ered what we needed for re­tire­ment, as­sump­tions about kids’ ed­u­ca­tion, in­sur­ance, how to make full use of the Sup­ple­men­tary Re­tire­ment Scheme and Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund nom­i­nees.</p>
    <p>It was pretty com­pre­hen­sive and then there was a plan that made sure we had enough pots for re­tire­ment and the chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion, and that we didn’t over-in­sure nor un­der-in­sure.</p>
    <p>It was a re­ally re­as­sur­ing ex­er­cise be­cause while I had usu­ally saved a good pro­por­tion of my in­come, I didn’t have a sys­tem­atic plan be­fore.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A All the pa­ram­e­ters were part of the plan that Prov­i­dend put to­gether. I re­mem­ber some­body ad­vis­ing me that I should plan to live to 100, so that’s what I as­sumed.</p>
    <p>I don’t re­mem­ber the end amount at re­tire­ment, but what was very clear to me was the amount of money I needed to set aside now as a lump sum, and the re­cur­ring in­vest­ment to en­sure I had enough for re­tire­ment. I knew over­seas ed­u­ca­tion was ex­pen­sive, but I hadn’t re­alised I needed to set aside al­most $600,000 for two chil­dren’s over­seas ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>I don’t think I will re­tire till I am at least 70. But it would be re­ally nice to have the op­tion to re­tire at 55 or 60. So that ev­ery­thing you do in that last decade is based on how you can give back rather than out of need.</p>
    <p>Q Money­wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My late father was head of the pri­vate bank­ing depart­ment at a re­gional bank, and my mother worked for her fam­ily busi­ness sup­ply­ing equip­ment for the oil and gas in­dus­try, but is now re­tired. I have one brother.</p>
    <p>I grew up in Brad­dell View, which was then a Hous­ing and Ur­ban De­vel­op­ment Com­pany es­tate where there were lots of for­mer teach­ers and civil ser­vants.</p>
    <p>My par­ents didn’t have uni­ver­sity de­grees but my father worked his way up to lead­er­ship po­si­tions in one of the lo­cal banks.</p>
    <p>We had a for­tu­nate up­bring­ing where we never felt that we were de­prived of ma­te­rial wants or needs, nor did we have an ex­cess of lux­ury.</p>
    <p>I re­alised later that this was be­cause of metic­u­lous plan­ning and sav­ing on my par­ents’ part.</p>
    <p>When the fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 1984 hit, my father had to move the whole fam­ily – my brother was just born and I was two years old – to Jakarta to take on a new job to set up the bank’s of­fices in Jakarta, where we lived for two years.</p>
    <p>It was a big risk and change for the fam­ily, but the sac­ri­fices al­lowed the fam­ily to get on a more sta­ble fi­nan­cial foot­ing.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A It con­verts time, specif­i­cally time spent on work, into ma­te­rial plea­sure.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now...</p>
    <p>A A three-room free­hold con­do­minium in West Coast that is about 1,400 sq ft. Q I drive...</p>
    <p>A A dark blue Audi A3.</p>
