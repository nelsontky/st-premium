    <p>The up­com­ing move, cou­pled with sim­i­lar poli­cies, is seen as an at­tempt by Mr Trump to ce­ment his tough-on-China legacy and to box in­com­ing pres­i­dent Bi­den into hard­line po­si­tions on Bei­jing amid bi­par­ti­san anti-China sen­ti­ment in Congress.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is poised to add China’s top chip­maker SMIC and na­tional off­shore oil and gas pro­ducer CNOOC to a black­list of al­leged Chi­nese mil­i­tary com­pa­nies, ac­cord­ing to a doc­u­ment and sources, curb­ing their ac­cess to US in­vestors and es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions with Bei­jing weeks be­fore Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>Reuters last month re­ported that the US Depart­ment of De­fence was plan­ning to des­ig­nate four more Chi­nese com­pa­nies as owned or con­trolled by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary, bring­ing the num­ber of such firms af­fected to 35.</p>
    <p>A re­cent ex­ec­u­tive or­der is­sued by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump would pre­vent US in­vestors from buy­ing se­cu­ri­ties of the listed firms, start­ing late next year.</p>
    <p>It was not clear when the new tranche would be pub­lished in the Fed­eral Regis­ter. But the list com­prises China Con­struc­tion Tech­nol­ogy and China In­ter­na­tional En­gi­neer­ing Con­sult­ing Corp, in ad­di­tion to Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Corp (SMIC) and China Na­tional Off­shore Oil Corp (CNOOC), ac­cord­ing to the doc­u­ment and three sources.</p>
    <p>SMIC said it con­tin­ued “to en­gage con­struc­tively and openly with the US gov­ern­ment”, and that its prod­ucts and ser­vices were solely for civil­ian and com­mer­cial use. “The com­pany has no re­la­tion­ship with the Chi­nese mil­i­tary and does not man­u­fac­ture for any mil­i­tary end-users or end-uses.”</p>
    <p>SMIC shares closed 2.7 per cent lower yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>CNOOC’s listed unit, whose shares fell by al­most 14 per cent af­ter the Reuters re­port, said in a mar­ket state­ment that it had in­quired with its par­ent and learnt that it had not re­ceived any for­mal no­tice from the rel­e­vant US au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing, in re­sponse to a query about Wash­ing­ton’s planned move, said Bei­jing hoped the US would not erect bar­ri­ers to co­op­er­a­tion and dis­crim­i­nate against Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The US Depart­ment of De­fence and the Chi­nese Em­bassy in Wash­ing­ton did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>SMIC, which re­lies heav­ily on equip­ment from Amer­i­can sup­pli­ers, was al­ready in Wash­ing­ton’s cross hairs.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the Com­merce Depart­ment in­formed some firms that they needed to ob­tain a li­cence be­fore sup­ply­ing goods and ser­vices to SMIC, af­ter con­clud­ing there was an “un­ac­cept­able risk” that equip­ment sup­plied to it could be used for mil­i­tary pur­poses.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing move, cou­pled with sim­i­lar poli­cies, is seen as an at­tempt by Mr Trump to ce­ment his tough-on-China legacy and to box in­com­ing pres­i­dent Bi­den into hard­line po­si­tions on Bei­jing amid bi­par­ti­san anti-China sen­ti­ment in Congress.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign has de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The list is part of an ef­fort by the US to tar­get what it sees as China’s ef­forts to en­list cor­po­ra­tions to har­ness emerg­ing civil­ian tech­nolo­gies for mil­i­tary pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Lon­don said yes­ter­day that Bri­tish telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions firms must not in­stall new Huawei 5G kits af­ter Septem­ber next year, as part of a plan to purge the Chi­nese firm’s equip­ment from high-speed mo­bile net­works.</p>
    <p>“I am set­ting out a clear path for the com­plete re­moval of high-risk ven­dors from our 5G net­works,” Dig­i­tal Min­is­ter Oliver Dow­den said in a state­ment. “This will be done through new and un­prece­dented pow­ers to iden­tify and ban tele­coms equip­ment which poses a threat to our na­tional se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Britain has al­ready or­dered all Huawei equip­ment to be re­moved from its 5G net­work by the end of 2027, fall­ing in line with its in­tel­li­gence al­lies in­clud­ing the US which say the Chi­nese firm poses se­cu­rity risks.</p>
    <p>China has crit­i­cised that de­ci­sion, while Huawei said last week it was dis­ap­pointed Britain was look­ing to ex­clude it from the 5G roll­out af­ter the pub­li­ca­tion of new laws that could see firms fined £100,000 (S$178,300) if they in­fringe the ban.</p>
