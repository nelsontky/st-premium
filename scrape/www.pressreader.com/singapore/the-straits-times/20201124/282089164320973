    <p>Malay lan­guage teach­ers here who need to cater to stu­dents with ever-di­ver­si­fy­ing learn­ing needs can make use of the Malay Lan­guage Cen­tre of Sin­ga­pore’s (MLCS) arsenal of re­sources.</p>
    <p>The lat­est is Mari Mem­baca (Let’s Read), a read­ing re­source pack­age aimed at pre-school­ers and Pri­mary 1 and 2 pupils, which was launched dur­ing the cen­tre’s 10th an­niver­sary cel­e­bra­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The graded read­ing cards aim to nur­ture the pupils’ pre-read­ing abil­ity, en­rich their vo­cab­u­lary and en­hance their ba­sic com­pre­hen­sion skills.</p>
    <p>All Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) pre-schools and pri­mary schools will get the cards, which come in three dif­fi­culty lev­els to cater to pupils’ dif­fer­ent needs.</p>
    <p>At the event, the cen­tre also launched a book ti­tled Bicara</p>
    <p>Budi­man Sarkasi Said (The Wis­dom Of Sarkasi Said), chron­i­cling the life jour­ney and achieve­ments of the lo­cal batik master.</p>
    <p>The launch was at­tended by 345 par­tic­i­pants, com­pris­ing lec­tur­ers, teach­ers, ed­u­ca­tion of­fi­cers and un­der­grad­u­ates. It was held both in per­son at the cen­tre and via Zoom, with some tun­ing in from Malaysia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Run by MOE, the cen­tre was set up in 2010 to sup­port the train­ing and de­vel­op­ment of in­ser­vice Malay lan­guage teach­ers, and im­prove the qual­ity of the teach­ing and learn­ing of the lan­guage in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker ear­lier this year forced the cen­tre to pivot from its usual face-to-face train­ing ses­sions, it re­sponded by cre­at­ing a new suite of on­line cour­ses housed on the Stu­dent Learn­ing Space, an on­line learn­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>These cour­ses fo­cused on key ar­eas of prac­tice un­der the Skill­sFu­ture for Ed­u­ca­tors pro­fes</p>
    <p>sional de­vel­op­ment road map for teach­ers, cov­er­ing top­ics such as in­quiry-based learn­ing and dif­fer­en­ti­ated in­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion Ma­liki Os­man, who was guest of hon­our at the event, pointed out the cen­tre’s sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tion to teach­ers’ pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment and in im­prov­ing teach­ing and learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­liki, who is also Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for For­eign Af­fairs, said in his speech in Malay: “MLCS of­fers highly rel­e­vant and up-to-date cour­ses that are com­pa­ra­ble with ped­a­go­gies adopted and ap­plied in the teach­ing of other sub­jects.”</p>
    <p>He also said that, with the in­creas­ing num­ber of Malay fam­i­lies us­ing English as their main lan­guage, “such a change in pro­file cer­tainly poses a chal­lenge in lan­guage ac­qui­si­tion and learn­ing among our school­child­ren”.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, stu­dents en­ter­ing schools with di­verse lan­guage back­grounds and hav­ing di­verse mother tongue learn­ing needs re­quire teach­ers to equip them­selves with ex­ten­sive and indepth knowl­edge and skills to meet the di­verse stu­dents’ needs,” he added.</p>
