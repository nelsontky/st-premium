    <p>For decades now, peo­ple have been sound­ing the death knell for phys­i­cal books.</p>
    <p>As a rookie books re­porter in the 2000s, I cov­ered the rise of e-books, along with the pre­dic­tions of print on pulp go­ing the way of the dodo.</p>
    <p>Lit­er­ary read­er­ship was in de­cline as dig­i­tal en­ter­tain­ment held sway; and brick-and-mor­tar book­stores were clos­ing one af­ter an­other (this last, ad­mit­tedly, a func­tion of e-com­merce and Ama­zon.com rather than de­clin­ing de­mand).</p>
    <p>But books – the kind you sniff when they’re new and fall asleep with them spread open on your chest – have proved das­tardly and stayed.</p>
    <p>In th­ese pan­demic days, how­ever, what might fi­nally kill them is not de­mand but sup­ply.</p>
    <p>Last week, The New York Times re­ported how a print­ing short­age in the United States is se­ri­ously dis­rupt­ing the pub­lish­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Two of the coun­try’s big­gest print­ing com­pa­nies – Quad and</p>
    <p>LSC Com­mu­ni­ca­tions – are in fi­nan­cial trou­ble, with the for­mer hav­ing to shut plants and put its book-print­ing arm up for sale, and the lat­ter fil­ing for bank­ruptcy.</p>
    <p>Print­ing bot­tle­necks, as pub­lish­ers rush this month to put out ti­tles that were held back when the pan­demic started, are caus­ing de­lays in an­tic­i­pated books and re­prints of bestseller­s reach­ing con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, pub­lish­ers who rely on over­seas print­ers were left in the lurch when many Chi­nese print­ing plants shut down due to the Covid-19 cri­sis, and now grap­ple with lo­gis­tics is­sues as global ship­ping con­tin­ues to be patchy.</p>
    <p>Add to this mess the dis­tant prospect of pa­per short­age.</p>
    <p>Two of the world’s big­gest pa­per pro­duc­ers are clos­ing mills, cit­ing de­clin­ing de­mand partly ow­ing to Covid-19. While the moves by Fin­land’s UPM and Swe­den’s SCA are not ex­pected to af­fect cur­rent global sup­ply, it does take two mil­lion tonnes of pub­li­ca­tion pa­per out of the yearly equa­tion, ac­cord­ing to print­ing in­dus­try magazine Print 21.</p>
    <p>All of which is to say: The spike in de­mand for phys­i­cal books over the past decade is in dan­ger of be­ing scup­pered by real-world con­straints.</p>
    <p>Hold on, while I charge my dusty Kin­dle.</p>
    <p>As a reader – or even a writer with a tra­di­tional publisher – I did not of­ten think very hard about those who en­sured books rolled off the presses and be­came ac­tual ob­jects. But a new in­die press ven­ture has given me new-found ap­pre­ci­a­tion and re­spect for the ef­fi­cient, ded­i­cated book print­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Through­out the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, I worked on a trav­el­ogue of New Or­leans – a slim vol­ume with text and pic­tures I wanted to put out on my own. It was ther­apy in a way: As travel bans and re­stric­tions re­mained in force for much of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, I fo­cused on mak­ing sense of jour­neys past and what some places mean to me.</p>
    <p>I de­cided to call my fledg­ling, one-woman-show im­print</p>
    <p>Her­mit Press.</p>
    <p>Au­thor Ju­lia Cameron’s words from The Artist’s Way re­ver­ber­ated in my head: Work with what we have rather than lan­guish in com­plaints over what we have not.</p>
    <p>I took book de­sign cour­ses con­ducted via Zoom by Venezue­lean book de­signer</p>
    <p>Faride Mereb, a vis­it­ing scholar at Columbia Univer­sity. The pan­demic and so­cial dis­tanc­ing, iron­i­cally, meant that th­ese cour­ses or­gan­ised by the Cen­ter For Book Arts in New York City were now open to any­one in the world, and my class­mates in­cluded a pho­tog­ra­phy stu­dent in North Carolina and an edi­tor in La Paz, Bo­livia.</p>
    <p>I be­gan e-mail­ing book print­ers here about a small print run for my tiny book. Work­ing from home, they helped an­swer my ama­teur ques­tions about types of pa­per, cover card stock, trim sizes and bind­ing.</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker was par­tially lifted un­der phase one, the first per­son I left my home to see was Mr Ho Wah Yuen, boss of Ho Print­ing in Changi, who pa­tiently walked me through its print-on-de­mand pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>For a mem­ber­ship fee of $250, the Page­toPrint.com ser­vice al­lows self-pub­lish­ers to up­load their books’ dig­i­tal files and or­der any quan­tity to be printed. There are also de­liv­ery/dis­tri­bu­tion op­tions and a virtual re­tail shopfront.</p>
    <p>With­out hav­ing to worry about min­i­mum copies and keep­ing in­ven­tory, I de­cided to go with the printer. As a mostly self-taught de­signer, my dig­i­tal files had some er­rors – im­ages that were not in the right colour modes for the dig­i­tal presses to han­dle; mis­aligned ti­tles on the spines; mis­matched ISBN num­bers. But the printer’s cus­tomer ser­vice got in touch to alert me to fix them, an ex­tra layer of checks that I was grate­ful for.</p>
    <p>Last month, the first print run of New Or­leans ar­rived on my doorstep. I stacked the 30 copies on my din­ing ta­ble and in­haled their woody, inky scent. In an un­cer­tain world, it felt good to have made some­thing and to hold it in my hands.</p>
    <p>It may seem anachro­nis­tic to re­train as a publisher and book-de­signer in the 21st cen­tury. But with so many of us stay­ing home th­ese days, and hav­ing more time for cre­ative pur­suits, it makes per­fect sense to re­visit the no­tion of books as pre­cious pas­sion projects. Per­haps it is time to write that mem­oir you’ve been putting off or edit that po­etry col­lec­tion cur­rently ex­ist­ing on scraps of pa­per.</p>
    <p>And it will be tech­nol­ogy – once the har­bin­ger of print’s demise – that would en­able us to bring those projects to fruition.</p>
    <p>Print is far from dead. But for it to stick around, we have to stop tak­ing our lo­cal pub­lish­ing and print­ing sec­tors for granted.</p>
