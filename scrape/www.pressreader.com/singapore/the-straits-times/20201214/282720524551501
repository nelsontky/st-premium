    <p>Three ba­bies sit i n a cov­ered wagon out­side their class­room at MapleBear Horse City. “Say hi to the horse,” says Mrs Pa­tri­cia Koh, as a pony stands close by with its han­dler.</p>
    <p>The one-year-olds peer at it cu­ri­ously. One smiles while an­other cries, star­tled as the pony nudges close to the wagon.</p>
    <p>Mrs Koh, MapleBear Sin­ga­pore’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, calms the lit­tle one in a sooth­ing voice (“It’s okay, it’s okay”) and the baby stops cry­ing im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren at the six-year-old preschool in Bukit Timah en­joy reg­u­lar in­ter­ac­tions with their equine pals from Gal­lop Sta­ble, from short pony rides to groom­ing and feed­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>These are part of the cen­tre’s daily out­door ac­tiv­i­ties, which in­clude na­ture walks as well as dis­cov­ery ses­sions at its small but­ter­fly gar­den, which has host plants that at­tract in­sects so stu­dents can see the in­sects’ life cy­cle play out in real time. The Horse City preschool has 151 stu­dents in­clud­ing 13 ba­bies, with monthly fees of $1,580 for full-day child­care, or $2,180 for full-day in­fant care.</p>
    <p>By car­ing for an­i­mals, kids learn to care for oth­ers as part of their char­ac­ter ed­u­ca­tion, says Mrs Koh, a vet­eran ed­u­ca­tor in the early-child­hood scene. She over­sees 45 MapleBear cen­tres that blend Cana­dian best prac­tices with a bilin­gual im­mer­sion curriculum.</p>
    <p>As she watches a group of Kinder­garten 1 chil­dren queue to groom and ride a pony around a cir­cu­lar track, she says: “This con­fi­dence­build­ing is a big part of get­ting them ready for the fu­ture. It’s not just study­ing, it’s be­ing able to try any­thing, not afraid to fall, not afraid to have an ad­ven­ture.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Koh, who is pas­sion­ate about giv­ing chil­dren a child­hood filled with “broad-based and mean­ing­ful” ex­pe­ri­ences rather than teach­ing them by rote, says: “Learn­ing is not about pre­par­ing just for Pri­mary 1. Too many par­ents think a child will suf­fer, but by the time a child is six, if they go through a very en­rich­ing curriculum and ex­pe­ri­ences, they will do well.”</p>
