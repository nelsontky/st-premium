    <p>A sec­ond former Shell Eastern Petroleum em­ployee linked to a case in­volv­ing more than 300,000 tonnes of stolen gas oil worth over $200 mil­lion – the largest ever in Sin­ga­pore – ad­mit­ted to his role in the of­fences yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Former au­tho­rised gas safety tester Muham­mad Ashraf Hamzah worked with his then col­leagues to mis­ap­pro­pri­ate 55,321 tonnes of gas oil worth nearly US$25 mil­lion (S$33 mil­lion) be­tween 2014 and 2016. He has made no resti­tu­tion to Shell.</p>
    <p>He re­ceived at least $700,000 in ill-got­ten gains for his par­tic­i­pa­tion in the con­spir­acy.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty in a district court yes­ter­day to nine counts of crim­i­nal breach of trust in­volv­ing gas oil worth more than US$18 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Nine other sim­i­lar charges linked to the re­main­ing amount will be con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Ashraf also ad­mit­ted to one count of laun­der­ing a por­tion of his ill-got­ten gains when he bought a Volvo car worth about $200,000 in 2017.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber last year, an­other former Shell em­ployee, Sadagopan Prem­nath, 40, ad­mit­ted to his role in mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing gas oil worth about US$36.1 mil­lion be­tween 2017 and 2018. The In­dian na­tional will be sen­tenced next month.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing al­leged ac­com­plices, in­clud­ing Muzaf­far Ali Khan Muhamad Akram, 39, and Juandi Pun­got, 44, are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>The oil heist took place at Shell Pu­lau Bukom, the com­pany’s largest petro­chem­i­cal pro­duc­tion and ex­port cen­tre in the Asi­a­Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>The court heard that some time in 2007, Juandi and an­other man, iden­ti­fied as Ab­dul Latif Ibrahim, started a con­spir­acy to mis­ap­pro­pri­ate gas oil from Shell.</p>
    <p>They be­gan to con­duct “il­le­gal load­ings for the Anic 1 bunker ship”, a ves­sel owned by Sen­tek Ma­rine & Trad­ing, said Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Stephanie Chew.</p>
    <p>“Juandi and Latif were able to con­tinue un­de­tected as they would tam­per with the bunker me­ter. Em­bold­ened by their suc­cess, Juandi and Latif con­tin­ued to ex­pand their crim­i­nal en­ter­prise,” she added.</p>
    <p>The court heard that be­tween 2008 and mid-2013, the pair ex­panded their il­le­gal load­ings to many other bunker ships, and re­cruited other col­leagues, in­clud­ing Ashraf, who was roped in no later than 2010. The DPP said Muzaf­far was re­cruited be­tween late 2007 and early 2008.</p>
    <p>Four men, in­clud­ing Juandi and Ashraf, re­ceived up to $15,000 for each il­le­gal load­ing, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Ashraf fi­nally left the syn­di­cate in 2016 as he did not want to be in­volved any fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Shell l ater found that it had suf­fered an uniden­ti­fied loss of fuel and one of its rep­re­sen­ta­tives alerted the po­lice in Au­gust 2017.</p>
    <p>Ashraf, who is rep­re­sented by lawyer Anand Nalachan­dran, is out on bail of $50,000.</p>
    <p>He will be sen­tenced on March 2. For each count of crim­i­nal breach of trust, an of­fender can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined.</p>
