    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is mov­ing to­wards nom­i­nat­ing Ms Amy Coney Bar­rett to re­place the late Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg on the Supreme Court, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter, de­spite the Pres­i­dent say­ing on Mon­day he is con­sid­er­ing as many as five can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett, 48, had a meet­ing with Mr Trump and also sep­a­rately met White House Coun­sel Pat Cipol­lone on Mon­day, said peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>She is a favourite of anti-abor­tion rights ad­vo­cates, who are heav­ily lob­by­ing the White House and Mr Trump per­son­ally to nom­i­nate her. She is pre­ferred by Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple close to him.</p>
    <p>And her sup­port­ers have pointed out to the White House that as a Mid­west­ern Catholic, Ms Bar­rett may help the Pres­i­dent se­cure votes for his re-elec­tion in vi­tal Rust Belt and Great Lakes states where he cur­rently trails Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump told an au­di­ence in Day­ton, Ohio, on Mon­day that he would pick a woman. Ear­lier, he told re­porters at the White House he is look­ing at “five women” to fill the va­cancy but has “one or two” of them in mind as fi­nal­ists. The Pres­i­dent said Ms Bar­rett is among those un­der con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked if he would meet all five of his can­di­dates in per­son, Mr Trump said: “I don’t know, I doubt it. We’ll meet with a few, prob­a­bly.”</p>
    <p>A White House spokesman de­clined to com­ment on the Pres­i­dent’s Supreme Court can­di­date meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Within the White House, the only can­di­date for Ms Gins­burg’s seat cur­rently at­tract­ing se­ri­ous in­ter­est other than Ms Bar­rett is Ap­peals Court Judge Bar­bara Lagoa.</p>
    <p>She is a Cuban-Amer­i­can from Florida, as Mr Trump has re­peat­edly noted, which might help him in that must-win state.</p>
    <p>But Ms Lagoa is at the mo­ment a dis­tant sec­ond to Ms Bar­rett, a judge on the Sev­enth Cir­cuit Court of Ap­peals based in Chicago.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has ex­pressed some scep­ti­cism about her con­ser­va­tive cre­den­tials be­cause Ms Lagoa drew the votes of 27 Democrats when she was con­firmed to the Eleventh Cir­cuit Court of Ap­peals, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>Still, the process has been fast mov­ing and the Pres­i­dent could change his mind be­fore an an­nounce­ment is made.</p>
    <p>If ei­ther Ms Bar­rett or Ms Lagoa is nom­i­nated and con­firmed, six out of nine Supreme Court jus­tices would be Catholic, in a coun­try where Catholics make up only about 20 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion in the United States, the Amer­ica Mag­a­zine reported.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is set to light off a fu­ri­ous po­lit­i­cal bat­tle over the Supreme Court seat va­cated by Ms Gins­burg’s death last Fri­day, only about six weeks be­fore he stands for re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The prospect that he will re­place the lib­eral icon with a con­ser­va­tive ju­rist has outraged Democrats, who re­sponded by pour­ing more than US$120 mil­lion (S$163 mil­lion) into the party’s fund-rais­ing plat­form Ac­tBlue over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Demo­cratic leader Chuck Schumer told col­leagues that “noth­ing is off the ta­ble” if Repub­li­cans vote for Ms Gins­burg’s re­place­ment and Democrats take the White</p>
    <p>House and Se­nate in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Democrats are in­creas­ingly talk­ing up the pos­si­bil­ity of adding jus­tices to the apex court as a pos­si­ble re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has told al­lies that he thinks Ms Bar­rett is a smart, hard­nosed, con­ser­va­tive ju­rist who would also come across well dur­ing tele­vised con­fir­ma­tion hear­ings, ac­cord­ing to one of the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett was one of Mr Trump’s fi­nal­ists in 2018 when he was look­ing for a re­place­ment for Jus­tice An­thony Kennedy.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent in­stead nom­i­nated Mr Brett Ka­vanaugh, but Ms Bar­rett’s al­lies were told by White House staff at the time that she was be­ing saved for the next round of pos­si­ble nom­i­nees.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump tweeted yes­ter­day he would an­nounce his pick at the White House on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>A prac­tis­ing Catholic and the mother of seven chil­dren, in­clud­ing two adopted from Haiti and a young son with Down syn­drome, Ms Bar­rett is per­son­ally op­posed to abor­tion, one of the key is­sues dom­i­nat­ing the cul­tural di­vide in the US.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a child­hood in New Or­leans in the con­ser­va­tive south, she be­came a top stu­dent at Notre Dame law school in In­di­ana where she later went on to teach for 15 years.</p>
    <p>At the be­gin­ning of her le­gal ca­reer, she clerked for the renowned con­ser­va­tive Supreme Court Jus­tice An­tonin Scalia and took up his “orig­i­nal­ist” phi­los­o­phy of un­der­stand­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion as it was meant to be read at the time it was writ­ten, as op­posed to more pro­gres­sive in­ter­pre­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Praised for her finely honed le­gal ar­gu­ments, the univer­sity pro­fes­sor nev­er­the­less has lim­ited ex­pe­ri­ence of ac­tu­ally pre­sid­ing over a court­room, hav­ing taken to the Bench only in 2017, af­ter be­ing ap­pointed by Mr Trump as a fed­eral ap­peals court judge.</p>
