    <p>In a bustling noo­dle shop in New Taipei City, a wide ar­ray of noo­dles and braised dishes are of­fered, most with pork in them. The own­ers of the shop GaoYi use only pork from Tai­wanese pig farm­ers and will con­tinue to do so even when Tai­wan be­gins im­port­ing pork from the United States next year.</p>
    <p>Their high-schooler daugh­ter Michelle Huang, 17, who helps out at the shop, shook her head in dis­ap­proval when asked about Tai­wan’s new de­ci­sion. “My mother is against us­ing US pork, even if it might be cheaper. Tai­wan’s pork tastes bet­ter, and we’re also wor­ried that this will put Tai­wanese pig farm­ers out of busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>There are also health con­cerns: The US is among 27 coun­tries – which in­clude Ja­pan and New Zealand – that al­low meat from live­stock fed with the ad­di­tive rac­topamine, pro­nounc­ing it safe for hu­man con­sump­tion. The ad­dic­tive is used to en­hance the lean­ness of meat. Its use is banned in Tai­wan, main­land China, the Euro­pean Union and some 160 coun­tries and re­gions, due to sus­pected neg­a­tive im­pact on hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Michelle and her par­ents’ con­cerns are shared by many pig farm­ers and con­sumers around Tai­wan. While con­cerns about im­ported meats have al­ways been present among the Tai­wanese, they have hogged head­lines af­ter Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen said last month that from Jan 1, 2021, the is­land will al­low im­ports of pork from the United States, and Amer­i­can beef from cat­tle aged over 30 months.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion is seen as an ap­par­ent at­tempt to bro­ker a trade deal with the US, which has com­plained about Tai­wan’s bar­ri­ers to ac­cess for US pork and beef.</p>
    <p>The main op­po­si­tion Kuom­intang has pe­ti­tioned to hold a “food safety ref­er­en­dum” in Au­gust next year, say­ing that “ro­bust and re­cip­ro­cal Tai­wan-US re­la­tions shouldn’t come at the ex­pense of peo­ple’s health”. Tai­wan’s leg­is­la­ture is set to be­gin de­bates on the pol­icy change to­day, and with the KMT’s firm op­po­si­tion, heated dis­cus­sions are ex­pected.</p>
    <p>While the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion ac­knowl­edges that rac­topamine “may in­crease the num­ber of in­jured and/or fa­tigued pigs”, lit­tle has been said in stud­ies on the dan­gers it poses to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Pig farm­ers i n mid-west­ern Changhua county, where many of Tai­wan’s pig farms are based, have held protests against the new pol­icy. Changhua slaugh­ters around 750,000 pigs each year, amount­ing to over NT$10.7 bil­lion (S$500 mil­lion) in rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“Tai­wan’s farm­ers find it hard to un­der­stand how the gov­ern­ment can just de­cide to al­low pork with rac­topamine. We hope the cen­tral gov­ern­ment can ex­plain, not just to the pig farm­ers, but also to the peo­ple whose health is at risk,” said Changhua Swine As­so­ci­a­tion head Liao Hsueh-chiang.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has re­as­sured con­sumers that there will be sup­port­ing mea­sures rolled out along­side the meat im­ports. Butch­ers, su­per­mar­kets, restau­rants and ven­dors will be asked to put up signs in­di­cat­ing the ori­gins of their meat. NT$10 bil­lion will be given to pig farms, slaugh­ter­houses and cold­stor­age plants to up­grade fa­cil­i­ties to en­sure the lo­cal pork sec­tor re­mains com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics have called the pol­icy change a “po­lit­i­cal game”.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Tsai and her Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party (DPP) had been ve­he­mently against US pork im­ports since 2009, when her pre­de­ces­sor Ma Ying-jeou tried to get the leg­is­la­ture’s green light to buy US pork. But Ms Tsai said on Aug 28 that the pol­icy change was “in line with (Tai­wan’s) over­all in­ter­ests... and could boost Tai­wan-US ties”.</p>
    <p>Three days later, the Amer­i­can In­sti­tute in Tai­wan, the de facto US em­bassy, an­nounced that the US and Tai­wan will launch the Eco­nomic and Com­mer­cial Di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>“It’s clear that this is a po­lit­i­cal game,” said po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Kharis Tem­ple­man, who is work­ing on the Project on Tai­wan in In­doPa­cific at Stan­ford Univer­sity. He noted Tai­wan’s long-time strug­gle to rid the ma­jor ob­sta­cle to a trade deal with the US. Al­low­ing US pork im­ports also means the DPP might be los­ing sup­port in fu­ture elec­tions. “Pig farms are pre­dom­i­nantly lo­cated in ar­eas that tend to vote for the DPP, and if the DPP alien­ated that con­stituency, they could lose a lot of votes,” said Dr Tem­ple­man. Still, he thinks Ms Tsai did well in tak­ing a cal­cu­lated risk.</p>
    <p>“This isn’t a guar­an­tee that Tai­wan will get a trade deal with the US... But trade ne­go­ti­a­tions with the US would just be the first step to putting Tai­wan into broader global con­ver­sa­tion,” he said.</p>
