    <p>En­tre­pre­neur Wil­lie Lee wanted to work in a bank af­ter get­ting his de­gree in busi­ness man­age­ment in Mel­bourne, but the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis put paid to that idea and forced a re­think.</p>
    <p>He turned his hand to build­ing a busi­ness around mu­sic pro­duc­tion in his bed­room, and it even­tu­ally branched out to video and mul­ti­ple me­dia dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>That mod­est en­ter­prise be­came a lead­ing pro­duc­tion house known as the Big 3 Me­dia Group, with Mr Lee, 36, as man­ag­ing direc­tor.</p>
    <p>The group cov­ers video pro­duc­tion, an­i­ma­tion, sound and mu­sic, on­line con­tent and me­dia tech­nol­ogy de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>It also pro­vides other cut­tingedge so­lu­tions such as aug­mented and vir­tual re­al­ity, in­ter­ac­tive me­dia de­vel­op­ment, live stream­ing and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee says: “I wanted to make an im­pact on so­ci­ety and run­ning an or­gan­i­sa­tion such as a busi­ness was the surest way to do so.”</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing in this busi­ness and other sim­i­lar ones will con­tinue to bear fruit, he notes, as the me­dia pro­duc­tion in­dus­try rides on surg­ing de­mand, es­pe­cially in the dig­i­tal space.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has ex­ac­er­bated the adop­tion of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion even in the most tra­di­tional of busi­nesses. Re­mote work­ing as well as vir­tu­al­i­sa­tion of ex­pe­ri­ences will be on the rise and that is where we want to be,” Mr Lee says.</p>
    <p>“The next stage of growth for Big 3 Me­dia will be in cre­at­ing a more fully on­line ex­pe­ri­ence as well as in­no­vat­ing new me­dia prod­ucts that will be rel­e­vant in this new age of dig­i­tal ac­cel­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee says the fu­ture of me­dia prod­ucts will in­clude tech­nolo­gies like data an­a­lyt­ics, cloud stor­age and the in­creased use of vir­tual re­al­ity and aug­mented re­al­ity in video pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>“Now that we in­creas­ingly adopt work-from-home mod­els, it is cru­cial to have cloud stor­age for mo­bile work­ers who deal with large amounts of data. We also have to di­ver­sify the type of con­tent we de­liver as peo­ple start to con­sume more and more me­dia every sin­gle day.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee is mar­ried to a 35-yearold house­wife and they have two sons, aged three and four.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>A On a per­sonal level, I’m pretty in­vested in my busi­ness, with a small hold­ing in some riskier in­vest­ments such as cryp­tocur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>To me, work­ing on my busi­ness at this junc­ture of my life al­lows for more con­trol in achiev­ing my in­vest­ment goals.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some­where down the road, more di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion would be pru­dent.</p>
    <p>On a busi­ness level, the strat­egy is to in­vest in re­lated and com­ple­men­tary busi­nesses that will be able to lever­age the group’s cur­rent in­fra­struc­ture and net­work. In Big 3 Me­dia’s case, this means in­vest­ing in a mix of me­dia pro­duc­tion and con­tent de­vel­op­ment busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>I in­vest less than 5 per cent of my port­fo­lio in cryp­tocur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A In this Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, it is great to look out for busi­nesses that are un­der­val­ued. This means tra­di­tional me­dia busi­nesses that have po­ten­tial for adapt­ing into dig­i­tal for­mats.</p>
    <p>How­ever, what is unique in this cli­mate is the ac­cel­er­ated dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and evolv­ing me­dia land­scape, which may cause cer­tain busi­nesses to be ob­so­lete.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore im­por­tant that while there are many great op­por­tu­ni­ties for in­vest­ment, it must be paired with a deep, hard look at the op­por­tu­ni­ties, rel­e­vance and sus­tain­abil­ity in the un­fore­seen new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Me­dia taste and con­sump­tion be­hav­iours change rapidly. With the en­try of new me­dia plat­forms like TikTok, even con­tent com­pa­nies that rode on the wave of pop­u­lar plat­forms such as YouTube are now find­ing it dif­fi­cult to stay rel­e­vant and have to rein­vent their con­tent to suit chang­ing tastes.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A There was no one point of epiphany for me in in­vest­ing, but it was a grad­ual ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the im­por­tance of in­vest­ing while start­ing a busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A My in­vest­ment strat­egy is re­ally to have fo­cus on the ar­eas that I am al­ready pas­sion­ate about, such as the me­dia busi­ness. Hav­ing depth of un­der­stand­ing of how the me­dia in­dus­try works and how me­dia com­pa­nies op­er­ate around the world helps in­form me on what ar­eas of in­vest­ment to un­der­take.</p>
    <p>I find that com­pa­nies will­ing to adapt and em­brace the new con­cept of work­ing re­motely and the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of ser­vices and prod­ucts will emerge as the most suc­cess­ful ones.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan?</p>
    <p>A I be­lieve it’s never too early to write a will and for­mu­late a let­ter of ad­min­is­tra­tion. A yearly re­view of these will al­low you to be fo­cused on the task at hand and re­move any doubt that may dis­tract you.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I’m plan­ning to live sim­ply and then ful­fil a life­long goal to travel over­land full-time around the world with my fam­ily in the next 10 years.</p>
    <p>As I have an in­ter­est in ex­plor­ing var­i­ous cul­tures, I would like to share that jour­ney with my fam­ily. We have no par­tic­u­lar des­ti­na­tions in mind to start with, but we know we want to ex­plore what the world has to of­fer.</p>
    <p>Of course, Covid-19 has been a stum­bling block for this year’s travel plans, but we hope to be able to pick up next year once the sit­u­a­tion sub­sides.</p>
    <p>There­after, I will eval­u­ate what I want to do next in life.</p>
    <p>I en­joy what I am do­ing now and be­lieve I will con­tinue to do so as long as I am able.</p>
    <p>Q Money­wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My fa­ther is a re­tired lec­turer in en­gi­neer­ing and my mother is a Chi­nese physi­cian who is still prac­tis­ing. I have an older brother and a younger sis­ter.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up, my fam­ily was thrifty and pru­dent and we could al­ways find joy in the sim­ple things.</p>
    <p>My fa­ther al­ways taught me that when han­dling money, one must be pru­dent in spend­ing but gen­er­ous to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>I find that com­pa­nies will­ing to adapt and em­brace the new con­cept of work­ing re­motely and the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of ser­vices and prod­ucts will emerge as the most ’’ suc­cess­ful ones.</p>
    <p>MR WIL­LIE LEE, man­ag­ing direc­tor of pro­duc­tion house Big 3 Me­dia Group.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A Money is a means to an end. It is a re­source to ac­cess ma­te­ri­als and ex­pe­ri­ences to en­rich and en­hance one’s life.</p>
    <p>I truly be­lieve that money is not the most im­por­tant thing in life and find that it is merely a medium we use to ob­tain the things we both need and want.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now...</p>
    <p>A A four-bed­room space that over­looks Bukit Timah Hill</p>
    <p>Q I drive...</p>
    <p>A A sim­ple blue Honda SUV that is great for Ikea fur­ni­ture runs and fer­ry­ing the fam­ily around.</p>
