    <p>The lone lo­cally trans­mit­ted coro­n­avirus case re­ported yes­ter­day was from a work­ers’ dor­mi­tory, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said in a state­ment last night.</p>
    <p>The man was asymp­to­matic and the in­fec­tion was de­tected through proac­tive sur­veil­lance, said MOH, adding that his poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test re­sult in­di­cated a low vi­ral load.</p>
    <p>His close con­tacts in the dor­mi­tory and his work­place have been iso­lated and placed in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>There were nine con­firmed cases in all yes­ter­day, bring­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,239.</p>
    <p>The other eight cases were im­ported. They com­prised one Sin­ga­porean, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs), two work pass hold­ers, two short-term pass hold­ers and a de­pen­dant’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean and both PRs had re­turned from the United States. Both work pass hold­ers were from Nepal, while both short-term visit pass hold­ers ar­rived from In­done­sia. The de­pen­dant’s pass holder was an 18-year-old woman who came from France.</p>
    <p>All eight cases were asymp­to­matic when tested, and all were placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and tested, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of four new cases in the past week, all of which are un­linked.</p>
    <p>With one more pa­tient dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,130 peo­ple have re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>There are 26 pa­tients still in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, and 39 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
