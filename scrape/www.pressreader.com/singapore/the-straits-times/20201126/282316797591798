    <p>re­turn to their pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic con­trac­tion eased to 5.8 per cent year on year in the third quar­ter af­ter a 13.3 per cent de­cline in the pre­vi­ous three months.</p>
    <p>The in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions as well as finance and in­sur­ance sec­tors strength­ened fur­ther, off­set­ting some of the pain in avi­a­tion, tourism and re­tail.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment sees the econ­omy shrink­ing 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent this year be­fore re­bound­ing to 4 per cent to 6 per cent growth next year, ac­cord­ing to es­ti­mates re­leased on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>DIG­I­TAL BANK PLAN</p>
    <p>MAS, which is also Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tor, will stick with its plans to award dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cences by the end of this year, un­de­terred by tight­en­ing scru­tiny in China and the US that is hit­ting ma­jor Chi­nese ap­pli­cants.</p>
    <p>“Reg­u­la­tory tight­en­ing that’s hap­pen­ing in China will not have an im­pact on the dig­i­tal banks here,” said Mr Menon. “It’s not our job to try to guess what the geopo­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion might be like, what ac­tions might be taken by other coun­tries with re­spect to some of these en­ti­ties.”</p>
    <p>The per­mits are cov­eted by Chi­nese com­pa­nies and oth­ers, given the Repub­lic’s sta­tus as a re­gional fi­nan­cial hub and rapidly grow­ing wealth man­age­ment cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s Ant Group, among the high-pro­file can­di­dates vy­ing for the per­mits, shelved its ini­tial public of­fer­ing af­ter a clam­p­down and higher cap­i­tal re­quire­ments im­posed by Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>ByteDance, whose joint ven­ture is an­other con­tender, has been hit by the US gov­ern­ment’s or­der to sell its Tik­Tok video app.</p>
    <p>Other Chi­nese com­pa­nies vy­ing for the li­cences in­clude a con­sor­tium led by Zall Smart Com­merce Group and an­other in­volv­ing mo­bile phone maker Xiaomi and Hong Kong fi­nan­cial firm AMTD Group.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has its own re­quire­ments for dig­i­tal bank li­cences that in­clude the abil­ity to pro­vide good ser­vices with ap­pro­pri­ate risk man­age­ment, and a smooth exit strat­egy, Mr Menon said, with­out con­firm­ing any ap­pli­cants’ iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>He said the MAS is tak­ing a pro­gres­sive ap­proach in reg­u­lat­ing such com­pa­nies, such as by re­strict­ing their abil­ity to take de­posits ini­tially, be­fore giv­ing them per­mis­sion to op­er­ate more freely once they prove prof­itabil­ity over time.</p>
    <p>“China started from a dif­fer­ent place – ini­tially, it did not reg­u­late many of these fin­tech en­ti­ties to the full ex­tent. And now the au­thor­i­ties are con­verg­ing to the same po­si­tion as most of the rest of the world. I think that’s the right thing to do, and it cre­ates a level play­ing field.”</p>
    <p>Asked if gov­ern­ment re­la­tion­ships would play a role in the reg­u­la­tor’s de­ci­sion-mak­ing on the li­cences, he ruled out favouritis­m and said it is “strictly merit-based”.</p>
    <p>“We will not pe­nalise banks from any coun­try be­cause of sanc­tions it might be un­der,” he said. “We also don’t give favourable treat­ment to banks from any coun­try on ac­count of good re­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the MAS post­poned its plan to award dig­i­tal­bank­ing per­mits to non-banks from June, ow­ing to the global Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Now, the virus is ac­cel­er­at­ing the switch to dig­i­tal bank­ing. Mr Menon said of­fice space and the num­ber of bricks-and-mor­tar bank branches may be­come smaller over time, with their role chang­ing from one fo­cused on pro­cess­ing daily trans­ac­tions to things like ad­vi­sory ser­vices on in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>“The dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion agenda has been given a real shot in the arm by Covid-19, and some of this change is re­ally per­ma­nent,” he said. “Face-to-face in­ter­ac­tions will be based on much higher-value ac­tiv­i­ties and trans­ac­tions.”</p>
