    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s elec­tion cam­paign has asked a judge to de­clare him the win­ner in Penn­syl­va­nia, saying the state’s Repub­li­can-con­trolled leg­is­la­ture should se­lect the elec­tors that will cast votes in the US Elec­toral College sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In a court fil­ing, the cam­paign asked US District Judge Matthew Brann to con­sid­er­ing is­su­ing an or­der that “the re­sults of the 2020 pres­i­den­tial general elec­tion are de­fec­tive and pro­vid­ing for the Penn­syl­va­nia General Assem­bly to choose Penn­syl­va­nia’s elec­tors”.</p>
    <p>The re­quest was part of a larger bid by the Trump cam­paign to amend a Nov 9 law­suit chal­leng­ing the out­come in Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den won with 306 elec­toral votes to Mr Trump’s 232 na­tion­wide. The win­ner needs 270, and Mr Trump would have to flip the out­come in Penn­syl­va­nia, with 20 elec­toral votes, and two other states.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den won Penn­syl­va­nia by around 82,000 votes, ac­cord­ing to Edi­son Research.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s le­gal team, led by his per­sonal lawyer Rudy Gi­u­liani, also sought per­mis­sion from Judge Brann to put back le­gal claims that it dropped on Sun­day from the law­suit. They said Repub­li­can ob­servers were de­nied ac­cess to the count­ing of mail-in bal­lots, an as­ser­tion elec­tion of­fi­cials dis­pute.</p>
    <p>The law­suit also al­leges in­con­sis­tent treat­ment by county elec­tion of­fi­cials of mail-in bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Some coun­ties no­ti­fied vot­ers that they could fix mi­nor de­fects such as miss­ing “se­crecy en­velopes” while oth­ers did not.</p>
    <p>Judge Brann ex­pressed scep­ti­cism of the law­suit at a hear­ing on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign has filed a flurry of law­suits in a long-shot bid to re­verse the elec­tion. Mr Trump has claimed with­out ev­i­dence that the elec­tion was “stolen”.</p>
    <p>A Reuters poll on Wed­nes­day showed about half of Repub­li­cans be­lieve Mr Trump had the elec­tion stolen from him.</p>
