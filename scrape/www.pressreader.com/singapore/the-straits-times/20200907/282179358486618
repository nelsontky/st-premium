    <p>The Noor Azlin case is sig­nif­i­cant for its de­ci­sion’s anal­y­sis of hos­pi­tals’ li­a­bil­ity for sys­temic fail­ures, two law pro­fes­sors say in the Sin­ga­pore Academy of Law’s (SAL) jour­nal.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion by the Court of Ap­peal also made clear that “judges will not sec­ond-guess doc­tors”, wrote Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore law pro­fes­sor K. Amirthalin­gam and Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law pro­fes­sor Gary Chan in a re­cent joint ar­ti­cle in the SAL’s An­nual Re­view for 2019 cases.</p>
    <p>“Re­gard­less of the niceties of the law, doc­tors should be re­as­sured by the Sin­ga­pore Court of Ap­peal’s reaf­fir­ma­tion that in the ar­eas of di­ag­no­sis, treat­ment and care, judges will de­fer to med­i­cal opin­ion in re­solv­ing the stan­dard of care in cases in­volv­ing gen­uine med­i­cal con­tro­versy un­less the opin­ion is log­i­cally in­de­fen­si­ble,” they said in the ar­ti­cle e-pub­lished in July.</p>
    <p>The law pro­fes­sors listed the case as one of the 10 most sig­nif­i­cant judg­ments in the tort of neg­li­gence for 2019.</p>
    <p>Ms Noor Azlin Ab­dul Rah­man had sued Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (CGH) and its doc­tors, claim­ing their neg­li­gence had de­layed the de­tec­tion of her can­cer and led to an ad­verse med­i­cal out­come.</p>
    <p>The High Court judge found CGH neg­li­gent for fail­ing to pro­vide the ap­pel­lant with the Xray re­ports or its find­ings to en­able her to de­ter­mine for her­self whether she needed a fol­low-up or to have a sec­ond opin­ion. The judge found the physi­cian neg­li­gent for fail­ing to sched­ule a fol­low-up to en­sure that the opac­ity had cleared, but the ac­ci­dent and emer­gency (A&E) doc­tors were cleared of neg­li­gence.</p>
    <p>Al­though CGH and the physi­cian were held to have acted neg­li­gently, the judge dis­missed the claim, hold­ing that Ms Noor had failed to show that it was neg­li­gence that caused the dam­age.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal re­versed the judge’s de­ci­sion in re­la­tion to CGH, find­ing that its neg­li­gence had caused the loss. The top court up­held the de­ci­sions in re­la­tion to the three doc­tors.</p>
    <p>“The court also em­pha­sised that in de­ter­min­ing the stan­dard of care, it would take into ac­count the spe­cial­i­sa­tion of the doc­tor and the sur­round­ing con­text; this is par­tic­u­larly rel­e­vant to emer­gency medicine,” said the law pro­fes­sors in their ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>In re­la­tion to the hos­pi­tal, the court had found its then sys­tem of rout­ing ra­di­o­log­i­cal re­ports back to the A&E depart­ment to be un­safe as A&E doc­tors might be too busy with emer­gen­cies to re­view re­ports care­fully.</p>
    <p>Among other things , the court also found that CGH did not have a mech­a­nism to con­sol­i­date all the pa­tient’s in­for­ma­tion to en­sure an un­in­ter­rupted flow of in­for­ma­tion to all pro­fes­sion­als deal­ing with the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>The court found Ms Noor had proved on a bal­ance of prob­a­bil­i­ties that she was suf­fer­ing from lung can­cer by July 2011. This was based on the size of the nod­ule and the pace of its growth in size be­tween 2010 and 2011 as well as the di­ag­no­sis of Stage IIA can­cer in March 2012. Thus CGH was found li­able as its neg­li­gence led to a de­lay in di­ag­no­sis and likely cure, wrote the law pro­fes­sors.</p>
