    <p>Al­birex Ni­igata coach Keiji Shige­tomi and Tampines Rovers coun­ter­part Gavin Lee have won the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) as as­sis­tants. To­day, one of them will lead his team to the ti­tle – this time as the top man. Al­birex lead the ta­ble on 29 points, one ahead of Tampines.</p>
    <p>Gavin Lee has been here be­fore.</p>
    <p>Six years ago, he was as­sis­tant to then-coach Alex Weaver and watched as their War­riors FC side cap­tured an un­likely S-League ti­tle de­spite start­ing the fi­nal round in sec­ond spot be­hind Brunei DPMM.</p>
    <p>To­day, Lee, now the head coach, will be aim­ing to re­peat his­tory as his Tampines Rovers seek to over­haul Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) lead­ers Al­birex Ni­igata in the last game of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Stags trail Al­birex by a point and need to not only beat Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional but also hope the Ja­panese club drop points against Hougang United.</p>
    <p>In 2014, the only way Lee and the War­riors, who were play­ing Al­birex, could lift the S-League tro­phy was if they bet­tered DPMM’s re­sult against Tampines.</p>
    <p>Both con­tenders were level on 50 points but the Brunei side had a vastly su­pe­rior goal dif­fer­ence. Yet they lost 2-1 to Tampines while the War­riors pre­vailed 1-0 to com­plete a stun­ning turn­around.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing what it was like go­ing into the game, Lee said: “With Alex, the ap­proach to the game was sim­i­lar for ev­ery game – we went in with the full in­ten­tion to win it and we fo­cused on that and what we could con­trol.”</p>
    <p>That Oc­to­ber night in 2014 still holds im­por­tant lessons for Lee.</p>
    <p>He said: “We def­i­nitely re­mem­ber it, even be­fore the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got a bunch of play­ers who aren’t go­ing to give up un­til the fi­nal whis­tle and af­ter games like that against the Young Li­ons (Tampines con­ceded first but won 3-1) in Novem­ber, it’ll be the same this com­ing Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“As long as there’s hope, you can ex­pect the best from us.”</p>
    <p>The Stags will also be aided by sup­port from the stands.</p>
    <p>There will be 200 fans in­side Our Tampines Hub, the first time spec­ta­tors are al­lowed into sta­di­ums since March 14, when games were held be­hind closed doors due to the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But Tampines de­fender Daniel Ben­nett, who was part of the War­riors’ ti­tle-win­ning squad in 2014, is not draw­ing par­al­lels be­tween the two sea­sons.</p>
    <p>He said: “I wouldn’t re­ally com­pare it. The way we played that time, we were prob­a­bly not the top team and not ex­pected to win.</p>
    <p>“This time, I think we should’ve won it. It’s a lit­tle bit dis­ap­point­ing, but go­ing into this last game, we are all very re­laxed be­cause there’s no pres­sure on us.”</p>
    <p>Tampines’ last league crown was in 2013 and Lee’s work there has es­tab­lished the 30-year-old as one of the coun­try’s bright­est coach­ing prospects.</p>
    <p>He joined Tampines in 2018 as as­sis­tant to Jur­gen Raab and suc­ceeded the Ger­man last year. In his first sea­son as head coach, Lee won the Sin­ga­pore Cup and guided Tampines to sec­ond in the SPL and their AFC Cup group, nar­rowly miss­ing out on qual­i­fy­ing for the group stages.</p>
    <p>His coach­ing ca­reer be­gan as a teenager when he helped his fa­ther Lawrence, also a foot­ball coach, dur­ing a foot­ball camp. He then joined pri­vate foot­ball academy JSSL Sin­ga­pore at 18, be­fore be­com­ing its gen­eral man­ager in 2016.</p>
    <p>He paid trib­ute to his var­i­ous men­tors like Weaver, Tampines chair­man Des­mond Ong, JSSL Sin­ga­pore founder Har­vey Davis and vet­eran coach Kadir Ya­haya, and said the most im­por­tant les­son he has learnt as a coach has been to let play­ers en­joy their foot­ball. Ben­nett, 42, can at­test to that. He said: “I know when Gavin started, a lot of peo­ple ques­tioned whether he was old enough and a lot of peo­ple ques­tion whether I’m young enough, but in the end, age doesn’t re­ally mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery­one can see that when we play well, we are one of the most at­trac­tive teams to watch in the league and that’s down to Gavin and his hard work. He eats, sleeps, breathes foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“He’s one of the best man­agers I’ve worked un­der.”</p>
    <p>We’ve got a bunch of play­ers who aren’t go­ing to give up un­til the fi­nal whis­tle...</p>
