    <p>Dur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s gen­eral elec­tion in July, for­eign-based so­cial me­dia ac­counts par­tic­i­pated ac­tively in con­ver­sa­tions on the polls, ac­cord­ing to a com­pany that pro­vides so­cial me­dia an­a­lyt­ics ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Us­ing geo-tech­nol­ogy, Melt­wa­ter also found that most of them were owned by real users with a gen­uine in­ter­est in Sin­ga­pore’s pol­i­tics and so­cial is­sues, it said in a re­port pub­lished on its web­site on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>They were not In­ter­net bots, it added, re­fer­ring to soft­ware apps that can be pro­grammed to spread dis­in­for­ma­tion and am­plify neg­a­tive pub­lic sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>Melt­wa­ter cited ex­am­ples in the run-up to Polling Day on July 10 to sup­port its con­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>One of them is a state­ment made by the po­lice on July 5, on then Work­ers’ Party (WP) Sengkang GRC can­di­date Raeesah Khan’s al­leged com­ments in her so­cial me­dia posts on dis­crim­i­na­tion by law en­force­ment au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The en­su­ing on­line chat­ter on race and in­equal­ity in Sin­ga­pore came from at least 17 coun­tries. Of these, 20.5 per cent orig­i­nated from Sin­ga­pore, fol­lowed by 7.6 per cent from Malaysia. On Twit­ter, half of the posts were retweets and 47 per cent were quoted tweets.</p>
    <p>An­other ex­am­ple Melt­wa­ter gave is a June 28 Straits Times re­port on 10 pro­pos­als from the WP man­i­festo. One pro­posal is to let sin­gles ap­ply for a Build-To-Or­der flat ear­lier, at the age of 28 in­stead of hav­ing to wait un­til they turn 35.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Melt­wa­ter, users from at least six coun­tries took part in the dis­cus­sions and no bot-like ac­tiv­i­ties were de­tected. It said: “The con­ver­sa­tions were mainly neu­tral, as ne­ti­zens ex­pressed their de­sires to own a home at a young age. The posts also did not carry any no­table po­lit­i­cal slant.”</p>
    <p>It, how­ever, noted an un­usual se­ries of Twit­ter ac­counts with names that had the same coun­try pre­fix “VN”, fol­lowed by a ran­dom string of num­bers. There were at least seven such ac­counts and they were cre­ated in June and July. Six of the seven are now sus­pended, said Melt­wa­ter, which is head­quar­tered in San Francisco.</p>
    <p>It ob­served that the tweets posted by these ac­counts were “ex­tremely crit­i­cal” of some po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers, with a few fo­cused on call­ing for the ar­rest of Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, and al­leg­ing that the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment pub­lishes fake news.</p>
    <p>These ac­counts ex­hib­ited ques­tion­able be­hav­iour but their in­flu­ence on GE2020 was “neg­li­gi­ble”, it added.</p>
    <p>Melt­wa­ter fur­ther noted that so­cial me­dia plat­forms such as Face­book and Twit­ter are tak­ing a proac­tive stance against for­eign in­ter­fer­ence cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>But it cau­tioned that so­cial me­dia users need to re­main on guard against de­lib­er­ate false­hoods and in­flu­ence op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery na­tion is vul­ner­a­ble to such an at­tack,” it said. “As a so­ci­ety, we can­not af­ford to be com­pla­cent or risk the in­tegrity of our pol­i­tics.”</p>
