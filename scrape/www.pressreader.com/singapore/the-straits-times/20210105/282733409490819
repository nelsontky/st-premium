    <p>With in­ter­na­tional travel cur­tailed, many peo­ple are now en­joy­ing lo­cal ex­pe­ri­ences such as cook­ing classes and tours.</p>
    <p>If you are keen on both of these ac­tiv­i­ties, home-grown tour com­pany Let’s Go Tour of­fers cook­ing tours called Let’s Go Cook. You can choose from Thai, Hokkien and Hainanese cook­ing.</p>
    <p>The daily morn­ing or evening ses­sions start with a short tour of an hour or so to in­tro­duce the cul­ture of the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>For the Thai ses­sion, guide Colin Goh takes you around Golden Mile Com­plex, which is known as Sin­ga­pore’s Lit­tle Thai­land for its many shops and eater­ies sell­ing Thai prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Then it is back to the com­pany’s premises in Craw­ford Lane, which have a cook­ing stu­dio.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh, who has worked as a chef at res­tau­rants like Xi Yan, dons an apron and turns into a cook­ing in­struc­tor.</p>
    <p>It is a mostly hands-on af­fair, with all par­tic­i­pants chip­ping in to pre­pare a com­mu­nal meal.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing some cook­ing ex­pe­ri­ence helps, as you are re­quired to cut in­gre­di­ents and do some fry­ing or boil­ing. But for more dif­fi­cult tasks like chop­ping up a chicken, Mr Goh can take over.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one then tucks in.</p>
    <p>Which cui­sine suits your palate? The Straits Times checks out three of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>DIS­COVER THAI­LAND</p>
    <p>Golden Mile Com­plex is not un­fa­mil­iar to me as I of­ten visit the Thai su­per­mar­ket there to buy in­gre­di­ents to make dishes such as tom yam and red curry.</p>
    <p>But I still dis­cover things I did not know about the iconic build­ing in Beach Road. For ex­am­ple, there is a swim­ming pool on the fifth floor for res­i­dents of the apart­ments above, which is now closed.</p>
    <p>And the su­per­mar­ket not only stocks food from Thai­land, but also has a sec­tion ded­i­cated to Viet­namese prod­ucts. It is fun to scour the shelves and iden­tify veg­eta­bles and sauces.</p>
    <p>Back at the cook­ing stu­dio, it is time to get busy. There are three items on the menu – pa­paya salad, tom yam soup and a sweet snack called khanom tako, which is a small corn pud­ding topped with co­conut milk.</p>
    <p>Prac­ti­cally ev­ery­thing has to be made from scratch, which means a lot of prep work – such as shred­ding a green pa­paya into thin strips and re­mov­ing ker­nels from the corn cob.</p>
    <p>As I fu­ri­ously cut and chop, I also learn to fold ba­nana leaves into small cups for the snack and pick up a neat trick to re­move the veins from prawns.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh stresses an im­por­tant rule in cook­ing – taste and ad­just as you go along, in­stead of stick­ing res­o­lutely to a recipe.</p>
    <p>I heed his ad­vice. While I have mea­sured out the sea­son­ings, I add them a lit­tle at a time to ad­just the flavours to my taste.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, I like tom yam sour and spicy, so I throw in more lime juice and chill­ies, plus a gen­er­ous dose of fish sauce, to achieve the right bal­ance.</p>
    <p>DIS­COVER HOKKIEN</p>
    <p>We start at an old cof­fee shop nes­tled among the Hous­ing Board blocks in Craw­ford Lane – a stone’s throw from the Let’s Go Tour of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh, who is Hokkien, tells a story about its Hock Chew own­ers and their pop­u­lar kopi that comes with but­ter. Hock Chew or Fuzhou is a city in Fu­jian prov­ince, China.</p>
    <p>We move on to a small tem­ple near the wet mar­ket, where Mr Goh in­tro­duces the deities in­side that are wor­shipped by the Hokkiens. He shares that many tem­ples here were built by Hokkiens who struck it rich and wanted to give back to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The cook­ing ses­sion i nvolves two fam­ily recipes handed down to Mr Goh.</p>
    <p>For his Fuzhou red wine chicken, a pop­u­lar con­fine­ment dish, he uses rice wine lees that he fer­ments for 40 days.</p>
    <p>The dish turns out per­fect – full of umami and with­out an overly strong fer­mented taste. It is served with mee sua.</p>
    <p>The stir-fried rice cake is a Chi­nese New Year dish for Mr Goh’s fam­ily. The gluti­nous rice sticks or nian gao are stir-fried with meat and veg­eta­bles into an all-in-one meal, mak­ing it an ideal dish for any oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>DIS­COVER HAINAN</p>
    <p>I am ex­cited about this ses­sion be­cause I get to learn how to cook Hainanese chicken rice, an iconic hawker dish, from scratch.</p>
    <p>But first, I work up an ap­petite with a walk around Beach Road, Seah Street, Mid­dle Road and Vic­to­ria Street, where the Hainanese set­tled in Sin­ga­pore’s early years.</p>
    <p>The tour starts at the Sin­ga­pore Hainan Hwee Kuan, a clan as­so­ci­a­tion in Beach Road, and weaves through cof­fee shops in the vicin­ity opened by the Hainanese.</p>
    <p>Swee Kee in Mid­dle Road, which sold Hainanese chicken rice, was pos­si­bly the most fa­mous eatery there un­til it closed in 1997. Two shops in the nearby Seah Street now bear its name – Sin Swee Kee and Zheng Swee Kee. They sell chicken rice, but are not re­lated to the orig­i­nal Swee Kee.</p>
    <p>Al­though ea­ger to whip up the dish at the cook­ing stu­dio, I am cowed by the idea of chop­ping up a chicken and de­cide to leave the heavy work to Mr Goh.</p>
    <p>But I do pick up a good tip: Ladling hot wa­ter over the bird be­fore low­er­ing it into the pot to poach firms up the skin and keeps the meat moist.</p>
    <p>I also learn where to trim off the fat and ex­cess skin that are used to fry the rice grains with pan­dan, gar­lic and ginger be­fore ev­ery­thing goes into the rice cooker.</p>
    <p>I am given the lighter task of mak­ing the chilli dip as well as a less com­mon spring onion and ginger dip that goes very well with poached chicken.</p>
    <p>We also make a kueh called yi bua, with rice flour dough stuffed with gula me­laka, se­same seeds, crushed peanuts and grated co­conut. It is a snack I have eaten many times, but never knew the name of.</p>
    <p>It is sur­pris­ingly easy to make, al­though try­ing to make the skin as thin as pos­si­ble with­out break­ing it can be a lit­tle tricky.</p>
