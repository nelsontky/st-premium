    <p>GIVE A HALF DOSE</p>
    <p>The Ox­ford/As­traZeneca vac­cine has been plagued by un­cer­tainty about its most ef­fec­tive dosage ever since data pub­lished in Novem­ber showed a half dose fol­lowed by a full dose had a 90 per cent suc­cess rate, while two full shots were 62 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US govern­ment is con­sid­er­ing giv­ing some peo­ple half the dose of Moderna’s Covid-19 vac­cine in or­der to speed up vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Data from Moderna’s clin­i­cal tri­als demon­strated that peo­ple aged be­tween 18 and 55 who re­ceived two 50-mi­cro­gram doses showed an “iden­ti­cal im­mune re­sponse” to the stan­dard of two 100-mi­cro­gram doses, said Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, head of Oper­a­tion Warp Speed, the US fed­eral vac­cine pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>DE­LAY SEC­OND DOSE</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said last Wed­nes­day that it would pri­ori­tise mak­ing sure that more peo­ple re­ceive their first dose of a Covid-19 vac­cine from As­traZeneca/Ox­ford or Pfizer/BioN­Tech quickly, rather than giv­ing a sec­ond shot to those who have al­ready had one.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish reg­u­la­tor said a gap of three months be­tween shots could boost its ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>But Pfizer noted that there is no data to show that pro­tec­tion af­ter the first dose is sus­tained af­ter 21 days, its rec­om­mended in­ter­val be­fore a sec­ond dose.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca said an in­ter­val of be­tween four and 12 weeks was “shown in clin­i­cal tri­als to be safe and ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing symp­to­matic Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>MIX AND MATCH</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said peo­ple could be given a mix-and-match of two Covid-19 shots on ex­tremely rare oc­ca­sions, even though there is a lack of ev­i­dence about the ex­tent of im­mu­nity of­fered by mix­ing doses.</p>
