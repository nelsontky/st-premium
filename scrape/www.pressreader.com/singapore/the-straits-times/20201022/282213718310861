    <p>Hong Kong’s Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways yes­ter­day said it would slash 5,900 jobs and end its re­gional Cathay Dragon brand, join­ing peers in cut­ting costs as it grap­ples with a plunge in de­mand due to the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Cathay would also seek changes in con­di­tions in its con­tracts with cabin crew and pi­lots as part of a re­struc­tur­ing that would cost HK$2.2 bil­lion (S$385 million), it told the stock ex­change.</p>
    <p>Over­all, it will cut 8,500 po­si­tions, or 24 per cent of its nor­mal head­count, but that in­cludes 2,600 roles cur­rently un­filled due to cost re­duc­tion ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>“The global pan­demic con­tin­ues to have a dev­as­tat­ing im­pact on avi­a­tion and the hard truth is we must fun­da­men­tally re­struc­ture the group to sur­vive,” chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Au­gus­tus Tang said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Cathay shares jumped al­most 7 per cent in early trade, with bro­ker Jef­feries say­ing the an­nounce­ment re­moved a key over­hang on the stock.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) and Aus­tralia’s Qan­tas Air­ways have al­ready an­nounced sim­i­larly large pay­roll cuts, as the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion fore­casts pas­sen­ger traf­fic will not re­cover un­til 2024.</p>
    <p>Cathay, which has stored around 40 per cent of its fleet out­side Hong Kong, on Mon­day said it planned to op­er­ate less than 50 per cent of its pre-pan­demic ca­pac­ity next year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­ceiv­ing a HK$39 bil­lion res­cue pack­age led by the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment in June, it had been con­duct­ing a strate­gic re­view that an­a­lysts ex­pected would re­sult in ma­jor job losses.</p>
    <p>The air­line said it was bleed­ing HK$1.5 bil­lion to HK$2 bil­lion of cash a month and the re­struc­tur­ing would stem the out­flow by HK$500 million a month next year, with ex­ec­u­tive pay cuts con­tin­u­ing through­out next year.</p>
    <p>Bocom In­ter­na­tional an­a­lyst Luya You said she had ex­pected more strate­gic in­sight from the air­line on its fleet plans and route net­work. “Had they re­vealed more on fleet plan­ning for 2021-22, we would get a much bet­ter sense of their out­look,” she said.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to end re­gional brand Cathay Dragon is in line with ri­val SIA’s pre-pan­demic move to fold re­gional brand Silkair into its main brand.</p>
    <p>Cathay Dragon, once known as Drag­o­nair, op­er­ated most of the group’s flights to and from main­land China and had been hit by fall­ing de­mand be­fore the pan­demic due to wide­spread anti-gov­ern­ment protests in Hong Kong that de­terred main­land trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Plans to end the brand ear­lier this year hit road­blocks from China’s avi­a­tion reg­u­la­tor be­cause of in­frac­tions dur­ing last year’s pro-democ­racy protests, two sources told Reuters in May.</p>
    <p>Cathay said the air­line would cease op­er­at­ing im­me­di­ately and it would seek reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to fold the ma­jor­ity of Cathay Dragon’s routes in Cathay Pa­cific and low-cost arm HK Ex­press.</p>
    <p>“Now that Cathay has de­cided on staff count and the elim­i­na­tion of the Dragon brand it knows the size of the air­line and the struc­ture go­ing for­ward and can com­plete its new fleet and net­work plan,” said in­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie.</p>
    <p>Like SIA, Cathay lacks a do­mes­tic mar­ket to cush­ion it from the fall in in­ter­na­tional travel due to bor­der clo­sures. In Septem­ber, its pas­sen­ger num­bers fell by 98.1 per cent com­pared with a year ear­lier, though cargo car­riage was down by a smaller 36.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Cathay shares are down 43 per cent since the start of Jan­uary. The air­line’s share reg­is­ter is dom­i­nated by Swire Pa­cific, Air China, Qatar Air­ways and the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment, with only a 12 per cent free float.</p>
