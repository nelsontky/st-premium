    <p>France marked a key mile­stone re­cently in its re­la­tions with Asean, one which gives a boost to the coun­try’s goal of play­ing a more ac­tive role in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Last month, Asean granted France the sta­tus of De­vel­op­ment Part­ner, in recog­ni­tion of its ef­forts in pro­mot­ing mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, and peace and se­cu­rity in the re­gion. Given Asean’s cen­tral­ity in a strate­gic re­gion, this is a plus for French ef­forts to con­trib­ute to an in­clu­sive Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>France is a na­tion of the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion. Its overseas ter­ri­to­ries stretch from La Re­union, off the coast of Africa, to French Poly­ne­sia, in the Pa­cific, through</p>
    <p>New Cale­do­nia and Wal­lis and Fu­tuna. One and a half mil­lion French cit­i­zens live on these is­lands, and their wa­ters ac­count for more than 90 per cent of French seas.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that, France’s eco­nomic and strate­gic in­ter­ests in the re­gion make it a player com­mit­ted to the sta­bil­ity of the Indo-Pa­cific. This is why we strive to de­velop our part­ner­ship with Asia-Pa­cific coun­tries at both mul­ti­lat­eral and bi­lat­eral lev­els.</p>
    <p>We aim to build on long-term co­op­er­a­tion and eco­nomic ties: In the past 10 years, France’s de­vel­op­ment agency has sup­ported more than 170 projects worth over €4 bil­lion (S$6.4 bil­lion) in Asean coun­tries to fos­ter sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. In ad­di­tion, France has a vi­brant busi­ness com­mu­nity, and its pres­ence in Asean trans­lates into €20 bil­lion in di­rect in­vest­ment stocks and 2,000 com­pa­nies and sub­sidiaries cre­at­ing 240,000 jobs.</p>
    <p>France’s strat­egy for an in­clu­sive Indo-Pa­cific, un­veiled in 2018, aims to step up this en­gage­ment across the board.</p>
    <p>At a time when Asia’s eco­nomic rise cre­ates a world of op­por­tu­ni­ties and shapes in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions, France is de­ter­mined to part­ner with South-east Asian na­tions to pro­mote mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and a sta­ble en­vi­ron­ment for all.</p>
    <p>The re­gion’s po­si­tion is in­creas­ingly strate­gic, and Asean, in many ways much like the Euro­pean Union, has a col­lec­tive role to play. Faced with the risk of greater po­lar­i­sa­tion, both Asean and France must strengthen co­op­er­a­tion to deal with con­tem­po­rary global chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has only con­firmed how in­ter­con­nected we are and how much more ef­fi­cient it is to work to­gether rather than con­front each other. This is what drove France’s can­di­da­ture to the sta­tus of De­vel­op­ment Part­ner of Asean, af­ter be­com­ing the first Euro­pean coun­try to join the Treaty of Amity and Co­op­er­a­tion in South-east Asia in 2007.</p>
    <p>THREE PRI­OR­I­TIES</p>
    <p>To fur­ther de­velop its part­ner­ship with Asean, France has pro­posed three pri­or­i­ties: fos­ter­ing hu­man and eco­nomic ex­changes, con­tribut­ing to peace and sta­bil­ity and pre­serv­ing global pub­lic goods. In the case of the third, France has been a ma­jor fun­der of the global health sys­tem: It is the sec­ond-largest pub­lic donor to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and Malaria. Re­cently, it par­tic­i­pated in the launch of the Ac­cess to Covid-19 Tools Ac­cel­er­a­tor, an ini­tia­tive de­signed to fa­cil­i­tate the ac­cess of all coun­tries in tools against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In Asean, our part­ner­ship also com­prises re­search net­works, and it is against this back­drop that France and Sin­ga­pore launched a bi­lat­eral work­ing group on in­fec­tious dis­eases in July.</p>
    <p>France is also greatly in­volved in the pro­tec­tion of the en­vi­ron­ment and works closely with Asean coun­tries on bio­di­ver­sity, the blue econ­omy, en­ergy tran­si­tion and sus­tain­able agri­cul­ture to meet the tar­gets laid out in the 2015 Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change. Again, sci­en­tific ex­changes play an im­por­tant role in our co­op­er­a­tion – France aims to have 20,000 stu­dents from South-east Asia study­ing in French uni­ver­si­ties by 2025, a twofold in­crease in six years.</p>
    <p>France has con­sis­tently shown its com­mit­ment to the peace and sta­bil­ity of the Indo-Pa­cific. Its par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Shangri-La Di­a­logue at a high level ev­ery year is an ex­pres­sion of that.</p>
    <p>French armed forces also have a his­tory of joint train­ing and ex­er­cises with their South-east Asian coun­ter­parts, in par­tic­u­lar the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air</p>
    <p>Force, whose pi­lots have trained in Cazaux, France, since 1998.</p>
    <p>French navy ships and air­craft are reg­u­larly de­ployed in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion to up­hold the free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion and over­flight and to sup­port a rules-based in­ter­na­tional or­der. These op­er­a­tional ca­pa­bil­i­ties also play an im­por­tant role in mar­itime se­cu­rity, and France has par­tic­i­pated since the 2009 in­cep­tion of the In­for­ma­tion</p>
    <p>Fu­sion Cen­tre based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>French in­volve­ment is also sig­nif­i­cant in the train­ing of peace­keep­ers. Fur­ther­more, last year, it was granted ob­server sta­tus at Aseanapol, the or­gan­i­sa­tion gath­er­ing Asean’s chiefs of po­lice forces, where poli­cies against transna­tional crime are dis­cussed. In re­cent years, it has also stepped up co­op­er­a­tion with Asean’s Re­gional Hu­man­i­tar­ian As­sis­tance and Dis­as­ter Re­lief Co­or­di­na­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The depth of French co­op­er­a­tion in de­fence and se­cu­rity re­flects its con­tri­bu­tion to peace and sta­bil­ity and pro­vides a ba­sis for a stronger part­ner­ship with Asean de­fence struc­tures. Its new sta­tus as Asean’s De­vel­op­ment Part­ner paves the way for wider and deeper col­lab­o­ra­tion at a time when cer­tain coun­tries are turn­ing in­wards.</p>
    <p>In these test­ing times, more than ever, we need to stay true to our com­mon vi­sion of an in­clu­sive Indo-Pa­cific re­gion. France’s am­bi­tion, through its re­newed en­gage­ment with Asean, is to con­trib­ute to this up­hold­ing of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism.</p>
