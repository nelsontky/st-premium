    <p>The On­line Ci­ti­zen (TOC) editor Terry Xu last year told writer Rubaashini Shun­mu­ganathan to in­clude some “cre­ative writ­ing” in her ar­ti­cle that al­legedly de­famed Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu, tes­ti­fy­ing on the se­cond day of the hear­ing on PM Lee’s li­bel suit against him, con­firmed this yes­ter­day dur­ing cross-ex­am­i­na­tion by PM Lee’s lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh.</p>
    <p>He also con­firmed that he had in­structed Ms Shun­mu­ganathan, a Malaysian, to write the ar­ti­cle ti­tled “PM Lee’s wife Ho Ching weirdly shares ar­ti­cle on cut­ting ties with fam­ily mem­bers”.</p>
    <p>When Mr Xu gave the writer the as­sign­ment on the morn­ing of Aug 15 last year through mes­sages on Slack, a mes­sag­ing plat­form for busi­nesses, he said the piece “needs some cre­ative writ­ing”, Mr Singh noted.</p>
    <p>He added that Mr Xu also in­structed her to add a few points to the ar­ti­cle, which cen­tred on an ar­ti­cle about “toxic fam­ily mem­bers” Ms Ho had shared on Face­book.</p>
    <p>The points in­cluded al­le­ga­tions by PM Lee’s sib­lings, Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling, on how PM Lee had mis­led their fa­ther, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, into think­ing that his house at 38 Ox­ley Road had been gazetted by the Gov­ern­ment. Th­ese were among the state­ments that PM Lee later com­plained were defam­a­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu pub­lished the ar­ti­cle a few hours later, af­ter the writer added the re­quested points.</p>
    <p>At the hear­ing, Mr Singh took Mr Xu through the var­i­ous claims in the five para­graphs from the ar­ti­cle that were al­legedly defam­a­tory. He then asked Mr Xu to ex­plain where he got the in­for­ma­tion from and what ev­i­dence he had to show the claims were true.</p>
    <p>The ba­sis of Mr Xu’s de­fence was that the claims in the ar­ti­cle were not defam­a­tory be­cause they were true “in sub­stance or in fact”, Mr Singh noted.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu replied that he had based the claims mostly on state­ments made by Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee in their joint pub­lic state­ments, as well as Face­book posts by Dr Lee. He said he had also con­sid­ered PM Lee’s side of the story while com­ing to his own con­clu­sions on who was telling the truth, as well as documents like e-mails that PM Lee’s sib­lings had re­leased with their state­ments.</p>
    <p>But when pressed for ev­i­dence for two par­tic­u­lar lines in the ar­ti­cle, Mr Xu could not pro­vide any.</p>
    <p>The lines, which re­ferred to Mr</p>
    <p>Lee Kuan Yew, Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee by their ini­tials, read: “How­ever, ac­cord­ing to Dr Lee, LKY be­gan to doubt the truth that Ox­ley had been ‘gazetted’ in late 2013, and it was sub­se­quently re­vealed to the late LKY that the house wasn’t gazetted.</p>
    <p>“If that is not all, the late LKY also re­moved PM Lee as an ex­ecu­tor and trustee of his will, mak­ing only the other two sib­lings, LHY and LWL, as the ex­ecu­tors.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh put it to Mr Xu that this was “where the cre­ativ­ity came in”, and that th­ese claims went be­yond merely re­peat­ing the al­le­ga­tions that PM Lee’s sib­lings had put out.</p>
    <p>“It would ap­pear, sir, that you took the op­por­tu­nity of Ms Ho Ching’s ar­ti­cle to at­tack (PM Lee) and say things be­yond what the sib­lings had al­leged... all the while giv­ing the im­pres­sion in your ar­ti­cle that you were – in­so­far as the al­le­ga­tions are con­cerned – merely re­peat­ing what the sib­lings had said,” Mr Singh said.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu dis­agreed with the char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion. He also dis­puted that the line on PM Lee’s re­moval as the ex­ecu­tor meant it hap­pened af­ter the el­der Mr Lee sup­pos­edly dis­cov­ered he had been mis­led.</p>
    <p>This was sim­ply one “pos­si­ble mis­in­ter­pre­ta­tion”, Mr Xu said, adding that he later in­cluded a note in the ar­ti­cle, af­ter re­ceiv­ing PM Lee’s com­plaint, to clar­ify that this was not what he meant.</p>
