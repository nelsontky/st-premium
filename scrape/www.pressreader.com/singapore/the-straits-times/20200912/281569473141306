    <p>The US Open will serve up a women’s sin­gles fi­nal be­tween a former cham­pion and a former fi­nal­ist. Ja­pan’s Naomi Osaka will seek her sec­ond Ma­jor win at Flush­ing Mead­ows while Vic­to­ria Azarenka of Be­larus will at­tempt to win her first Grand Slam since be­com­ing a mother nearly four years ago.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • There is no deny­ing the meeting of tennis’ most in­form play­ers i n the US Open women’s sin­gles fi­nal.</p>
    <p>A fort­night ago, Naomi Osaka with­drew from the Western & South­ern Open with a ham­string in­jury, hand­ing Vic­to­ria Azarenka the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The Be­laru­sian can ex­pect a much big­ger bat­tle for her first Grand Slam crown since 2013 when she faces the Ja­panese at Arthur Ashe Sta­dium to­day.</p>
    <p>Osaka, on a 10-game win­ning run, said a new mind­set had helped her to an un­beaten record since tennis re­sumed af­ter the coronaviru­s shut­down and she is de­ter­mined to take it with her into her third Grand Slam fi­nal.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old ap­peared un­flus­tered through­out a high-qual­ity US Open semi-fi­nal against Amer­i­can Jenny Brady on Thurs­day and emerged a 7-6 (7-1), 3-6, 6-3 win­ner.</p>
    <p>The 2018 US Open and 2019 Aus­tralian Open cham­pion now gets to test her men­tal strength against a re­vi­talised Azarenka, who stunned Ser­ena Wil­liams i n Thurs­day’s other block­buster semi-fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“I feel like the older you get, the more men­tally strong you are,” the Ja­panese told re­porters. “I think that’s some­thing that you learn from be­ing on the Tour for such a long time, play­ing so many matches.</p>
    <p>“For me, def­i­nitely my goal dur­ing these two tour­na­ments was to be more men­tally strong and to fight for every point. So that’s what I’m go­ing to go into the fi­nal with. Noth­ing is go­ing to change that.”</p>
    <p>Osaka’s ac­tivism has boosted her mo­ti­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The fourth seed, whose mother is Ja­panese and fa­ther is Haitian, has been protest­ing against racial in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Af­ter walk­ing out to the court for her opener wear­ing a mask fea­tur­ing the name of Bre­onna Tay­lor, a Black wo­man killed by po­lice of­fi­cers, she re­vealed she had seven masks in to­tal – one for each stage.</p>
    <p>She will get to don the sev­enth one to­day, when the un­seeded Azarenka will be no less driven.</p>
    <p>The former world No. 1’s re­turn to the top has been a long road full of chal­lenges and in­jury set­backs.</p>
    <p>Azarenka re­turned from ma­ter­nity leave in 2017 af­ter hav­ing her son Leo, only to have a bruis­ing cus­tody bat­tle with her former part­ner that kept her from com­pet­ing in that year’s Flush­ing Mead­ows cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old went a set down to Wil­liams on Thurs­day but showed great men­tal strength, and no small talent, to beat the 23-time Ma­jor sin­gles cham­pion at a Grand Slam for the first time in 11 at­tempts.</p>
    <p>It was also her 11th straight win af­ter go­ing a full cal­en­dar year with­out a sin­gle Tour-level vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“I just feel I’m very proud of my­self that I took that chal­lenge up from los­ing and turn it around and be­come bet­ter,” said the run­ner-up at the US Open to Wil­liams in 2012 and 2013.</p>
    <p>“I’m not talk­ing about a bet­ter tennis player. I’m talk­ing about a bet­ter per­son for my­self, for my son. That’s what I’m most proud of.”</p>
    <p>Azarenka de­feated Osaka in their only meeting on a hard court at a Grand Slam – a 6-1, 6-2 vic­tory in the round of 32 at the 2016 Aus­tralian Open. Osaka won their sub­se­quent meet­ings – round-of-64 en­coun­ters in Rome in 2018 and last year’s French Open.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing to be su­per fun,” Azarenka said of the up­com­ing clash, hav­ing sat in her as­signed suite to watch some of the OsakaBrady thriller. “She plays in­cred­i­ble.”</p>
