    <p>Pri­vate pi­lots at two of the ma­jor lo­cal fly­ing clubs here have been cau­tious about fly­ing over Malaysia amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, but are even more care­ful now af­ter an in­ci­dent last month when two Sin­ga­porean pi­lots per­formed an emer­gency land­ing on a Jo­hor high­way.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Fly­ing Club (RSFC), which has about 20 mem­bers, said it has ad­vised mem­bers not to fly into Malaysia since the be­gin­ning of the out­break, even be­fore the Nov 22 in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Sele­tar Fly­ing Club, which has about 50 mem­bers, said flights to Malaysia have been cut down sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>The mem­bers do so only when this is needed to help them main­tain their nav­i­ga­tion skills or to clock cross-coun­try fly­ing hours, both of which are not pos­si­ble in Sin­ga­pore due to its airspace lim­i­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Recre­ational fly­ing for vis­its has stopped. Prior to the pan­demic, pri­vate pi­lots had of­ten flown from Sele­tar Air­port to parts of Malaysia – such as Me­laka – where they would land and spend some time there.</p>
    <p>But with Covid-19 re­stric­tions on so­cial vis­its in both Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, this is no longer an op­tion. Those who still fly there af­ter ap­proval from the Malaysian au­thor­i­ties would mostly ex­e­cute touch-and-go land­ings at the air­ports there.</p>
    <p>Mr Lingam Pas­pa­thy, pres­i­dent of the RSFC, said the club is wait­ing for in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the Nov 22 emer­gency land­ing in­ci­dent to be com­pleted to see if there are any rule changes by the Malaysian au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Since the on­set of the pan­demic, RSFC has told its mem­bers to avoid fly­ing into Malaysian airspace to avoid run­ning afoul of any Covid-19 re­stric­tions should there be a forced land­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Jezreel Mok, gen­eral man­ager of Sele­tar Fly­ing Club and a full-time in­struc­tor, said: “We have sig­nif­i­cantly cut down on flights to Malaysia since the Covid-19 pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>“Most pri­vate pi­lots joined the club to get the chance to fly and travel around the re­gion, but they have stopped fly­ing since, due to the Covid-19 re­stric­tions.”</p>
    <p>While both clubs have ad­justed to the Covid-19 changes, Mr Lingam re­mains wor­ried about the long-term fu­ture of the lo­cal gen­eral avi­a­tion com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>He said some costs have mul­ti­plied com­pared with about a decade ago. For ex­am­ple, park­ing charges are now $750 monthly, up from $75 pre­vi­ously. The fees for touch-and-go land­ings at Sele­tar Air­port – where a plane briefly lands on a run­way be­fore tak­ing off again – now cost $35 per land­ing, up from $2.20 in the past, he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the an­nual main­te­nance cost to meet reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments for a Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered plane has in­creased to up to $120,000 a year, up from about $80,000 in the past, he added.</p>
    <p>A ses­sion with his club’s plane would now cost about $700 per hour, in or­der to cover the club’s cost. This is on top of the monthly mem­ber­ship fees re­quired to cover ad­min­is­tra­tive charges.</p>
    <p>“The ob­jec­tive of the fly­ing club is to make fly­ing af­ford­able to the pub­lic. This al­lows any­body who can’t join the air force or buy their own plane to achieve their dreams to fly,” said Mr Lingam.</p>
    <p>But the ris­ing costs “have made fly­ing un­af­ford­able”.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, mem­ber­ship at his club has been grad­u­ally fall­ing over the years. Some pri­vate pi­lots have also opted to learn fly­ing over­seas, such as in Malaysia or in the United States.</p>
    <p>Some have also turned to al­ter­na­tives like FlightS­chool.sg, which pre­pares stu­dents for pri­vate pi­lot li­cence tests in the US. Its founder Fabian Lim said it has been get­ting about 30 to 40 stu­dents a year.</p>
    <p>Mr Mok, who agreed that costs have been ris­ing for lo­cal fly­ing clubs, said it is a chal­leng­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“We’ll have to con­stantly work with reg­u­la­tors and part­ners to en­sure poli­cies and reg­u­la­tions re­main in­clu­sive and that the in­ter­ests of the com­mu­nity are met.</p>
    <p>“This will let Sin­ga­pore­ans con­tinue to have the op­por­tu­nity to pur­sue avi­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore, with­out hav­ing to go over­seas.”</p>
