    <p>MOSCOW • Umar Krem­lev, the new pres­i­dent of the In­ter­na­tional Box­ing As­so­ci­a­tion (Aiba), plans to im­ple­ment re­forms over the next six months that could help re­store its sta­tus with the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC), he told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Elected to head am­a­teur box­ing’s gov­ern­ing body ear­lier this month, the Rus­sian has been given the task of im­ple­ment­ing sweep­ing re­forms in or­der for it to be recog­nised by the IOC in time for the Paris Olympics in 2024.</p>
    <p>The IOC sus­pended Aiba l ast year, strip­ping it of any in­volve­ment in Olympic qual­i­fiers and this year’s Tokyo Games over a string of gov­er­nance, fi­nance and eth­i­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>“I have planned that it would take around six or seven months to im­ple­ment the re­forms,” said Krem­lev, who also serves as sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Rus­sian Box­ing Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s an am­bi­tious plan. This will not be easy to do.”</p>
    <p>Krem­lev, named chair­man of the Aiba mar­ket­ing com­mis­sion last year, has pledged to at­tract US$50 mil­lion (S$66.4 mil­lion) in fund­ing over the next two years to re­build the trou­bled or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>He added that he was al­ready hold­ing talks with in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies – the names of which he would not dis­close – to se­cure po­ten­tial advertisem­ent and spon­sor­ship deals.</p>
    <p>“I think we will soon an­nounce our spon­sors and make the sign­ing of any deals public,” he said.</p>
    <p>The IOC has said the sta­tus of Aiba would be re­viewed after the Tokyo Games, which have been post­poned by one year to next July be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Krem­lev is hop­ing to bring trans­parency to the body be­fore the 2024 Olympics, with the IOC over­see­ing the de­liv­ery of the box­ing com­pe­ti­tion in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>“The Aiba we see now has debts and prac­ti­cally no in­ter­ac­tion with the fed­er­a­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>“By the 2024 Olympic Games, you will see an in­de­pen­dent Aiba able to at­tract funds... and help na­tional fed­er­a­tions hold tour­na­ments.</p>
    <p>“By 2024, we need to make Aiba the clean­est or­gan­i­sa­tion, make it trans­par­ent for it to shine.”</p>
