    <p>A whole-of-na­tion ef­fort is es­sen­tial in com­bat­ing Covid-19, the Min­istry of Health’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said yes­ter­day as he re­flected on Sin­ga­pore’s ex­pe­ri­ence over the past nine months.</p>
    <p>A com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors has kept the coun­try’s fa­tal­ity rate low, such as an ef­fec­tive pub­lic health sys­tem as well as the tra­di­tional man­age­ment of clus­ters, in­clud­ing the early de­tec­tion of cases, com­mit­ment and ded­i­ca­tion to­wards iso­lat­ing them and dis­rupt­ing chains of trans­mis­sions, and the quar­an­tin­ing of close con­tacts, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak said at a we­bi­nar ti­tled Covid-19: Up­dates From Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The event was or­gan­ised by the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and fea­tured 16 speak­ers from around the world.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak also cited the dar­ing dis­ci­pline to shut down – if nec­es­sary – ser­vices that contribute­d to­wards the spread of in­fec­tion in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>An­other crit­i­cal fac­tor in pre­vent­ing deaths was a close watch over vul­ner­a­ble patients and those at higher risk.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak said: “We were de­ter­mined to take those who were at higher risk and bring them into the hos­pi­tal set­ting for closer mon­i­tor­ing and treat­ment, and by pro­tect­ing those who are vul­ner­a­ble, we have man­aged to keep the mor­bid­ity and com­pli­ca­tion rates low here in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>De­spite Sin­ga­pore’s ex­pe­ri­ence with the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome back in 2003, Covid-19 chal­lenged the na­tion on var­i­ous fronts: The Re­pub­lic had to in­crease its lab ca­pac­ity and the num­ber of iso­la­tion and quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties and in­ten­sive care unit beds, as well as bring in ad­di­tional re­sources and train new man­power, and re­cruit nu­mer­ous vol­un­teers to help fight the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But through this on­go­ing episode of fight­ing Covid-19, the na­tion has learnt the im­por­tance of us­ing new tech­nolo­gies and mas­ter­ing new care mod­els, as well as learnt the value of data and anal­y­sis, which help to drive con­tact trac­ing and to pre­dict where the next clus­ter might erupt, Prof Mak said.</p>
    <p>“We have learnt about how tele­health can change and dis­rupt... and bring new care mod­els into our hos­pi­tals and pri­mary care, we have learnt the value of pub­lic col­lab­o­ra­tions and... per­haps the most im­por­tant les­son of all – the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing pub­lic trust such that we would be con­fi­dent that the pub­lic and the com­mu­nity, the so­ci­ety would be with us as we im­pose lock­downs, what we call lo­cally the cir­cuit breaker re­stric­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Prof Mak stressed the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing global sol­i­dar­ity, to col­lab­o­rate to de­velop new di­ag­nos­tic tests, vac­cines and ther­a­peu­tics, as well as the im­por­tance of col­lab­o­ra­tions across the global front to al­low na­tions world­wide to safely re­open bor­ders and re­sume eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity.</p>
