    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19) Ag­i­ta­tion is part of the scene right now. See if you can find a way to work it to your ad­van­tage. Bring peace back in a few days.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You are en­dear­ing your­self to some­one new. All this good en­ergy adds up to a new ro­mance, friend or con­nec­tion, so work it.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Pay close at­ten­tion to your to-do list – there are some hid­den pit­falls there if you are not care­ful. To­mor­row will be eas­ier.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your so­cial en­ergy is per­fect, so make sure you con­nect with oth­ers. Most peo­ple are ready for any­thing, so sug­gest some­thing wild and new.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your spend­ing and in­come need some at­ten­tion. Try not to see it as a chore, but as a way to make your life eas­ier and more fun.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is mag­nif­i­cent, so get to work on some­thing new. It could be work-re­lated, home re­pair or some deeply per­sonal project.</p>
    <p>Li­bra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>This is the per­fect time to do noth­ing at all. See if you can swing a bit of sloth into your rou­tines – you need to recharge your bat­ter­ies.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Help a friend in need. Your en­ergy is just right for other peo­ple’s projects and you are sure to get that en­ergy back just when you need it.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Try not to ask for too much. Grat­i­tude for small things is what you need now and the big stuff is sure to come to you later.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You have the strength of 20 peo­ple, as far as pro­duc­tiv­ity goes. Your great en­ergy helps you whis­tle while you work and en­joy the day.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You feel much closer to emo­tional re­al­ity and should be able to han­dle al­most any prob­lem. Deal with lin­ger­ing bag­gage.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You need to fig­ure out what is go­ing on and one per­son can set you straight. Dis­cern­ing who that could be may take up most of the day.</p>
