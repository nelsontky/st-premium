    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ms Ma­rina Haba, the el­dest of six chil­dren to Ja­panese pachinko slot ma­chine mogul Han Chang-woo, first fell in love with Mr Joe Wal­lace when she was a col­lege stu­dent in 1991.</p>
    <p>He was then play­ing pro­fes­sional bas­ket­ball in Ja­pan for Isuzu Mo­tors Gi­ga­cats.</p>
    <p>Al­though they were dat­ing for less than a year, Ms Haba up­rooted her life and fol­lowed Mr Wal­lace’s bas­ket­ball ca­reer by mov­ing to Spain, Ar­gentina and France, but they parted ways after his pro­fes­sional re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia-born Mr Wal­lace re­turned to the US while Ms Haba went back to Ja­pan. They lost con­tact for 15 years, dur­ing which time they got mar­ried, had chil­dren and di­vorced.</p>
    <p>The two re­con­nected via Face­book in 2011 and, after a meet­ing in Van­cou­ver, rekin­dled their ro­mance and mar­ried in 2014.</p>
    <p>Ms Haba is now al­leg­ing that her fa­ther is a racist, with his dis­ap­proval of her re­la­tion­ship with an African-Amer­i­can man the rea­son why he cut her loose.</p>
    <p>Mr Han, on his part, is su­ing her for the im­me­di­ate re­turn of a loan of 480 mil­lion yen (S$6.2 mil­lion) with in­ter­est that he granted her in Septem­ber last year. He has also taken le­gal steps to seize all her as­sets and block her bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>But Ms Haba claims that her fa­ther and his com­pany Maruhan had un­justly with­held her right­ful stock op­tions and div­i­dend pay­ments, and in­tends to counter-sue in the Ky­oto court.</p>
    <p>But as a first step, she has launched court pro­ceed­ings in the US ter­ri­tory of Guam – where Maruhan has a sub­sidiary – to fa­cil­i­tate the doc­u­ment dis­cov­ery process to build her case in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“As lever­age to force his daugh­ter to divorce (her hus­band), Mr Han has moved to re­claim her shares in the fam­ily business... that he long ago gave to his daugh­ter with­out con­di­tion,” say her lawyers.</p>
