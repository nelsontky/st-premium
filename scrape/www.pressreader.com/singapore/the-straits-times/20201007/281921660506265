    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s for­mer spy chief, who is on trial for crim­i­nal breach of trust (CBT), used US$12.1 mil­lion (S$16.4 mil­lion) to buy six lux­ury watches and for other pur­poses with funds con­trib­uted to the gov­ern­ment, pub­lic prose­cu­tors said yes­ter­day at the start of her trial.</p>
    <p>In their open­ing state­ment, prose­cu­tors said they will ad­duce ev­i­dence to show that Hasanah Ab­dul Hamid had mis­ap­pro­pri­ated the sum un­der her purview as a pub­lic ser­vant, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Hasanah, 62, was di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the Malaysian Ex­ter­nal In­tel­li­gence Or­gan­i­sa­tion. The unit that she led was also called the Re­search Di­vi­sion of the Prime Min­is­ter’s De­part­ment.</p>
    <p>“The pros­e­cu­tion will sub­mit tes­ti­monies that the ac­cused, at the ma­te­rial time in her ca­pac­ity as di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the Re­search Di­vi­sion of the Prime Min­is­ter’s De­part­ment, had re­ceived con­tri­bu­tions amount­ing to US$12.1 mil­lion” from an ex­ter­nal party, deputy pub­lic prose­cu­tor Muhamad Iskan­dar Ah­mad was quoted as say­ing by Malay Mail on­line news.</p>
    <p>“Tes­ti­monies will also show how the ac­cused mis­ap­pro­pri­ated the funds by in­struct­ing her of­fi­cers to make six l ux­ury watches (sic) pur­chases, made pay­ments to third par­ties and trans­ported the re­main­ing monies out with­out hand­ing them over to the di­vi­sion or the gov­ern­ment.”</p>
    <p>DPP Iskan­dar said tes­ti­monies will show that the sum of money was pro­vided for a “spe­cial pur­pose” but that the ac­cused failed to carry this out.</p>
    <p>Hasanah had, on Oct 25, 2018, pleaded not guilty to a charge of com­mit­ting CBT amount­ing to US$12.1 mil­lion in funds be­long­ing to the gov­ern­ment when serv­ing as di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the unit.</p>
    <p>She was charged with com­mit­ting the of­fence at the of­fice of the Re­search Di­vi­sion in Putrajaya in 2018 be­tween April 30 and May 9.</p>
    <p>Hasanah was also charged un­der the Pe­nal Code, which pro­vides for a max­i­mum of 20 years in jail and whip­ping if found guilty.</p>
    <p>The High Court yes­ter­day al­lowed the pros­e­cu­tion’s ap­pli­ca­tion to have 11 of its 37 wit­nesses in the trial tes­tify in-cam­era – out of the pub­lic eye – Ber­nama news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial com­mis­sioner Ah­mad Shahrir Mohd Salleh said he al­lowed the ap­pli­ca­tion in the in­ter­est of na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“The pros­e­cu­tion would be ex­pos­ing na­tional se­cu­rity mat­ters to pub­lic gaze and ex­ten­sive me­dia cov­er­age should the ev­i­dence of the 11 prospec­tive wit­nesses be taken in open court,” Ber­nama news agency quoted him as say­ing.</p>
