    <p>Af­ter an el­derly woman liv­ing alone was not seen out­side her con­do­minium unit for months and let­ters be­gan pil­ing up out­side her door, the condo’s man­age­ment was no­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>But her fate was dis­cov­ered only more than a year later on Mon­day, when po­lice of­fi­cers en­tered her flat and found her re­mains.</p>
    <p>The woman, be­lieved to be Madam Lily Loh and in her 80s, was a res­i­dent at The Shore Res­i­dences, a condo in Am­ber Road near Ka­tong Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>An­other res­i­dent, who did not wish to be iden­ti­fied, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that Madam Loh lived alone and had only a dog for com­pany.</p>
    <p>She did not ap­pear to have fam­ily mem­bers nor any vis­i­tors, the res­i­dent added.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­turn­ing from an over­seas trip in Jan­uary last year, the res­i­dent stopped see­ing Madam Loh at the condo.</p>
    <p>At one point in Fe­bru­ary last year, there was also a “weird smell” in the com­mon hall­way.</p>
    <p>But it was gone weeks later, af­ter the res­i­dent re­turned from an­other over­seas trip.</p>
    <p>Later, mail be­gan to pile up in front of Madam Loh’s door, in­clud­ing court doc­u­ments that ap­peared to have in­volved her and the condo man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The man­age­ment was no­ti­fied about Madam Loh’s dis­ap­pear­ance, but noth­ing ap­peared to have been done, said the res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>It was only late last month that her miss­ing sta­tus was re­layed to Mr Lim Biow Chuan, who is MP for Mount­bat­ten.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim told The Straits Times that he, in turn, no­ti­fied the po­lice.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that po­lice of­fi­cers went to the door of the unit early this month, but en­tered the flat only on Mon­day, along with condo man­age­ment staff, who called them that day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said on Tues­day: “Upon po­lice ar­rival, re­mains be­lieved to be that of a hu­man and a dog were found in­side a res­i­den­tial unit at 87 Am­ber Road. Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions do not sus­pect foul play.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to ST’s queries, the condo man­age­ment said: “As we had some con­cerns re­gard­ing one of the res­i­dents liv­ing at The Shore ear­lier this week, we im­me­di­ately alerted the po­lice.”</p>
    <p>It did not give more details when asked why it had not acted sooner.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
