    <p>Af­ter a host of failed takeover bids since Mike Ashley bought English Pre­mier League side New­cas­tle in 2007, fans are ex­cited but also scep­ti­cal and wary over the lat­est one by Singapore-based Bel­la­graph Nova Group. They just want the club to be suc­cess­ful and not be­come “a rich per­son’s play toy”, one of them said.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • New­cas­tle United owner Mike Ashley has not re­sponded to the Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group’s £280 mil­lion (S$503 mil­lion) bid to buy the English Pre­mier League club, re­ported South Ty­ne­side daily The Shields Gazette on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Paris-based com­pany had de­clared that its co-founders – Singapore en­trepreneur­s Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh as well as Evan­ge­line Shen – “are at an ad­vanced stage of ne­go­ti­a­tion” for the takeover on Aug 15.</p>
    <p>This comes as Bri­tish daily The In­de­pen­dent re­ported that there is in­creas­ing con­fi­dence that the long-run­ning £300 mil­lion bid funded by Saudi Ara­bia’s Pub­lic In­vest­ment Fund (PIF) could be re­vived.</p>
    <p>The Saudi-led con­sor­tium, which in­cluded in­vest­ment firm PCP Cap­i­tal Part­ners and Bri­tish prop­erty bil­lion­aire broth­ers David and Si­mon Reuben, an­nounced its bid in March but there were de­lays due to the Pre­mier League’s own­ers’ and di­rec­tors’ test.</p>
    <p>Prob­lems sur­faced over pi­rate broad­casts of Pre­mier League games in Saudi Ara­bia by state­spon­sored rogue net­work be­outQ and hu­man rights is­sues, be­fore the group with­drew the bid last month. The col­lapse cen­tred on their un­will­ing­ness to take up the league’s of­fer of in­de­pen­dent ar­bi­tra­tion to de­cide the club’s own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to The In­de­pen­dent, the par­ties are still work­ing be­hind the scenes to find a com­pro­mise that will al­low the deal to take place.</p>
    <p>The main ob­sta­cle has been the role the Saudi govern­ment plays in New­cas­tle, with the group in­sist­ing that PIF does not seek dayto-day in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>The Mag­pies, man­aged by Steve Bruce, were 13th in the 2019-2020 sea­son and their high­est Pre­mier League plac­ings were sec­ond in 1995-96 and 1996-97.</p>
    <p>Sports Di­rect chief ex­ec­u­tive Ashley bought the club for £134 mil­lion in 2007 and BN Group is the sixth group linked with a takeover since he of­fi­cially put the club up for sale in Oc­to­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>Nu­mer­ous failed takeover bids in­clude one from a Chi­nese con­sor­tium that very month. Last year, Dubai-based bil­lion­aire Sheikh Khaled Zayed Al Nahyan was re­port­edly a prospec­tive buyer, while former Manch­ester United di­rec­tor Peter Kenyon’s Amer­i­can in­vest­ment fund GACP Sports was also in­ter­ested.</p>
