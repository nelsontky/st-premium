    <p>MI­LAN • Mau­r­izio Sarri de­scribed his first league ti­tle with Ju­ven­tus as “tast­ing sweet” af­ter a dif­fi­cult de­but sea­son for the veteran coach over­shad­owed by a three-month coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>“I told the play­ers ‘if you win with me who has never won any­thing, it is be­cause you are re­ally strong’,” the 61-year-old said af­ter the Turin gi­ants sealed their ninth straight league ti­tle on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Cris­tiano Ron­aldo and Fed­erico Bernarde­schi scored in ei­ther half as Ju­ven­tus beat Sam­p­do­ria 2-0 to move seven points ahead of sec­ond-placed In­ter Mi­lan and seal a 36th Scud­etto with two games to spare. The ti­tle is Sarri’s first in his 30-year coach­ing ca­reer and ex­tends a record Ju­ven­tus run which An­to­nio Conte started with three ti­tles from 2012. Mas­si­m­il­iano Al­le­gri con­tin­ued with the next five.</p>
    <p>“It has a sweet taste. Win­ning is hard and this club has been win­ning for so many years,” said Sarri, whose only pre­vi­ous tro­phy was the Europa League last year with Chelsea, the only time he coached out­side of Italy.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery year it is harder.”</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus were rarely bril­liant and of­ten dis­ap­point­ing, los­ing in two fi­nals, the Ital­ian Cup and the Ital­ian Su­per Cup.</p>
    <p>“Sar­rism” or “Sar­rib­all”, that fast­paced, eye-catch­ing style of foot­ball with which he made his name at Napoli, and which Ju­ven­tus bosses craved in Turin, was only seen in flashes this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Although the chain-smok­ing Sarri gave the team or­ders, he adapted to Juve and five-time Bal­lon d’Or win­ner Cris­tiano Ron­aldo. And in the end, it was the in­di­vid­ual bril­liance of play­ers such as Ron­aldo, who has scored 31 goals, and play­maker Paulo Dy­bala, rather than the man­ager’s tac­tics, which landed them suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo is the only player with top-flight ti­tles in Eng­land (Manchester United), Spain (Real Madrid) and Italy, while goal­keeper Gian­luigi Buf­fon be­came the first player to win 10 Serie A ti­tles, all with Ju­ven­tus.</p>
    <p>“There is no doubt that it was Juve who changed Sarri and not the other way around,” said former Ju­ven­tus and Eng­land coach Fabio Capello. “Juve is not an easy car to drive, there are play­ers with great per­son­al­i­ties and you have to prove that you have one too.”</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus’ fo­cus will now turn to their Cham­pi­ons League last-16 tie against Lyon on Aug 7, when Ju­ven­tus need to over­turn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg in France.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian side have not won the Euro­pean Cup since 1996.</p>
    <p>If they make it to Por­tu­gal, they have the un­en­vi­able task of fac­ing ei­ther Manchester City or Real Madrid in the quar­ter-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter an ex­tremely strange cham­pi­onship I ex­pect that the fi­nal phase of the Cham­pi­ons League will also be ex­tremely strange too,” pre­dicted Sarri.</p>
