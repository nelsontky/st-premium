    <p>It takes weeks to en­sure a sapling takes root.</p>
    <p>Mr N. Sivasothi, a se­nior lec­turer at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Depart­ment of Bi­o­log­i­cal Sciences, is well aware of the ar­du­ous, time-con­sum­ing work needed, hav­ing or­gan­ised man­grove clean-ups for two decades at Kranji Coastal Na­ture Park.</p>
    <p>Now, in part­ner­ship with the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) and in sup­port of the One Mil­lion Trees ini­tia­tive to en­hance Sin­ga­pore’s green canopy, he is ral­ly­ing the com­mu­nity to help trans­form the area into a coastal for­est over the next five years.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore we can be­gin plant­ing trees, we need to take a step back to pre­pare the soil by loos­en­ing and fer­til­is­ing it, which is where the hard work comes in,” said Mr Sivasothi, who also co­or­di­nates en­vi­ron­men­tal vol­un­teer groups such as the Bio­di­ver­sity Friends Fo­rum and the NUS Tod­dy­cats.</p>
    <p>Once fast-grow­ing veg­e­ta­tion cov­er­ing the site is cleared away, vol­un­teers be­gin dig­ging the hole to plant a tree. Dif­fer­ent types of soil en­hance­ments are added into the hole and the area is then set aside for one to two weeks to al­low it to set­tle. This will be fol­lowed by the plant­ing of saplings.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting the com­mu­nity to con­trib­ute to soil prepa­ra­tion helps to build intimacy with the plot of land, and they are en­cour­aged to con­tinue vis­it­ing the site to ob­serve and main­tain their saplings un­til they grow into trees,” said Mr Sivasothi.</p>
    <p>It is also im­por­tant to main­tain and mon­i­tor the saplings’ growth on a bi-monthly ba­sis as grass and other plants may grow over them.</p>
    <p>“This al­lows us to quickly in­ter­vene and alert NParks if cer­tain plants or species are not thriv­ing</p>
    <p>INTIMACY WITH THE LAND</p>
    <p>well. In turn, we also learn which species thrive or suf­fer in cer­tain con­di­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Fac­tors such as the el­e­va­tion of the soil, the area’s land-use his­tory and the pres­ence of “com­pet­ing” plants could af­fect a sapling’s sur­vival.</p>
    <p>Dr Adrian Loo, group di­rec­tor of NParks, said that plant species at the Sungei Bu­loh Na­ture Park Net­work, which cov­ers Kranji Coastal Na­ture Park, were se­lected for the project to “re­store the coastal beach and back man­gal habi­tats” which are a step fur­ther from the shore than the man­grove habi­tat.</p>
    <p>Some plant species have also been rein­tro­duced into the area to help re­ju­ve­nate the soil and to at­tract dis­persers such as birds which can help to stim­u­late the growth of other plants from ad­ja­cent forests.</p>
    <p>To en­sure con­ti­nu­ity in the up­keep of the planted saplings, Mr Sivasothi has iden­ti­fied a few vol­un­teer “lead­ers” who will be trained to guide their col­leagues and ex­pand com­mu­nity out­reach.</p>
    <p>He hopes that more such com­mu­nity-led ini­tia­tives will help Sin­ga­pore in­crease its tree pop­u­la­tion from seven mil­lion to eight mil­lion over the next 10 years.</p>
    <p>Get­ting the com­mu­nity to con­trib­ute to soil prepa­ra­tion helps to build intimacy with the plot of land.</p>
