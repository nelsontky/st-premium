    <p>OSLO • The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded yes­ter­day to the World Food Pro­gramme (WFP) for feed­ing mil­lions of peo­ple from Ye­men to North Korea, with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic seen push­ing mil­lions more into hunger.</p>
    <p>The WFP was hon­oured for “its ef­forts to com­bat hunger, for its con­tri­bu­tion to bet­ter­ing con­di­tions for peace in con­flict-af­fected ar­eas and for act­ing as a driv­ing force in ef­forts to pre­vent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and con­flict”, Nobel com­mit­tee chair­man Berit Reiss-An­der­sen said on un­veil­ing the win­ner in Oslo.</p>
    <p>Whether de­liv­er­ing food by he­li­copter or on the back of an ele­phant or a camel, the WFP prides it­self on be­ing “the lead­ing hu­man­i­tar­ian or­gan­i­sa­tion” in a world where, by its own es­ti­mates, some 690 mil­lion peo­ple – one in 11 – go to bed on an empty stom­ach.</p>
    <p>“With this year’s award, the Nor­we­gian Nobel Com­mit­tee wishes to turn the eyes of the world to­wards the mil­lions of peo­ple who suf­fer from or face the threat of hunger,” Ms Reiss-An­der­sen said.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1961, the United Na­tions (UN) or­gan­i­sa­tion helped 97 mil­lion peo­ple last year, dis­tribut­ing 15 bil­lion ra­tions to peo­ple in 88 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The num­bers are dizzy­ing but only a frac­tion of the to­tal num­ber in need. De­spite mak­ing progress over the past three decades, the UN’s goal to erad­i­cate hunger by 2030 ap­pears out of reach if cur­rent trends con­tinue.</p>
    <p>War can be caused by hunger, but hunger is also a con­se­quence of war, the WFP said.</p>
    <p>Its ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor David Beasley said last month: “There is no two ways about it – we can’t end hunger un­less we put an end to con­flict.”</p>
    <p>Ye­men, which is liv­ing through what the UN has de­scribed as the “largest hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis in the world”, is a stark ex­am­ple of this.</p>
    <p>Both the UN and aid agen­cies have re­peat­edly raised the alarm over the dis­as­trous con­se­quences of the con­flict that has claimed tens of thou­sands of lives since 2015, when a pow­er­ful mil­i­tary coali­tion led by Saudi Ara­bia joined the gov­ern­ment’s fight against Iran­backed Houthi rebels.</p>
    <p>The con­flict has dis­placed three mil­lion peo­ple and pushed the coun­try to the verge of famine.</p>
    <p>Two-thirds of Ye­men’s 30 mil­lion peo­ple do not know where their next meal will come from.</p>
    <p>The out­look for the world has grown even bleaker this year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has made food more ex­pen­sive and dis­rupted sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>“In coun­tries such as Ye­men, the Demo­cratic Re­pub­lic of Congo, Nige­ria, South Su­dan and Burk­ina Faso, the com­bi­na­tion of vi­o­lent con­flict and the pan­demic has led to a dra­matic rise in the num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing on the brink of star­va­tion,” the Nobel com­mit­tee said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s flag­ship car­rier Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and the Te­masek Foun­da­tion part­nered the WFP dur­ing the pan­demic, ar­rang­ing flights to trans­port med­i­cal sup­plies and other es­sen­tial items to ar­eas of need around the world. Te­masek con­trib­uted up to US$6.5 mil­lion (S$8.8 mil­lion) to cover the flight costs.</p>
    <p>The global re­ces­sion caused by the virus risks push­ing an ad­di­tional 83 mil­lion to 132 mil­lion peo­ple into hunger, the UN said in a July report.</p>
    <p>The virus will also af­fect the Nobel Peace Prize cer­e­mony on Dec 10 in Oslo, which has been scaled back due to Covid-19 curbs.</p>
    <p>The award con­sists of a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for 10 mil­lion Swedish kro­nor (S$1.5 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>“We are deeply hum­bled to re­ceive the #No­belPeacePr­ize. This is an in­cred­i­ble recog­ni­tion of the ded­i­ca­tion of the @WFP fam­ily, work­ing to end hunger ev­ery day in 80+ coun­tries,” Mr Beasley tweeted.</p>
    <p>“This is un­be­liev­able,” he said. “And this be­cause of the WFP fam­ily, they are out there in the most dif­fi­cult, com­plex places of the world.</p>
    <p>“Whether it is war, con­flict, cli­mate ex­tremes, it doesn’t mat­ter. They are out there, and they de­serve this award.”</p>
