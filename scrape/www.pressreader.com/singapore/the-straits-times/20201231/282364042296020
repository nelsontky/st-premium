    <p>A man who es­caped a police op­er­a­tion in his car, while two other men clung on to him, was charged in court yes­ter­day with two counts of caus­ing hurt by per­form­ing a rash act.</p>
    <p>Ryan Asyraf Mo­ham­mad A’zman was a wanted man for jump­ing bail, the police said in an ear­lier state­ment.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent at the carpark near Block 331 Bukit Ba­tok Street 33 hap­pened dur­ing a pre-dawn op­er­a­tion to ar­rest him on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>As police of­fi­cers ap­proached him, he al­legedly tried to speed off. “Of­fi­cers en­gaged the man but he re­fused to com­ply and at­tempted to es­cape in his ve­hi­cle,” said the police.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old Sin­ga­porean is said to have re­versed his car while two men – Mr Rubanesh­waran Gnana­sub­ra­ma­niam and Mr Mo­ham­mad Idly Ali – were hold­ing on to his right arm.</p>
    <p>The police said the two men are their of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The ve­hi­cle mounted a kerb near a sta­tion­ary police car and hit at least two parked cars be­fore speed­ing off.</p>
    <p>Mr Idly and Mr Rubanesh­waran were hurt in the in­ci­dent, which was caught in a 48-sec­ond video up­loaded on YouTube.</p>
    <p>The police man­aged to track down Ryan with the aid of se­cu­rity cam­eras. He was ar­rested just hours later in a unit at Block 257 Jurong East Street 24.</p>
    <p>Ryan is al­ready fac­ing weapons-re­lated charges.</p>
    <p>On Dec 19 last year, he was al­legedly found in pos­ses­sion of a fold­able knife at a carpark near Block 157 Seran­goon North Av­enue 1.</p>
    <p>On the same day, he was said to be found in the com­pany of a man who was armed with a fruit knife in a carpark near Block 248 Jurong East Street 24.</p>
    <p>He was then serv­ing a re­mis­sion or­der after his re­lease from prison last year.</p>
    <p>Un­der the or­der, he was sup­posed to stay out of trou­ble be­tween May 4 last year and April 2 this year. But he al­legedly breached it by com­mit­ting the weapons-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of the weapon­sre­lated of­fences, he will have to spend an ad­di­tional 106 days be­hind bars. His case has been ad­journed to Jan 27 next year.</p>
    <p>For each count of caus­ing hurt by per­form­ing a rash act, an of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $5,000.</p>
