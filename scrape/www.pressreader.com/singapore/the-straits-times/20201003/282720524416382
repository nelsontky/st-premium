    <p>Why can’t I shift my trans­mis­sion se­lec­tor from Drive (D) to Neu­tral (N) when I am coast­ing? I un­der­stand some cars have a coast­ing func­tion to save on fuel.</p>
    <p>While it is pos­si­ble to se­lect neu­tral on an au­to­matic gear­box dur­ing coast­ing, the trans­mis­sion is not de­signed to ac­com­mo­date coast­ing or free-wheel­ing in neu­tral.</p>
    <p>Oil pres­sure is crit­i­cal for an au­to­matic trans­mis­sion’s hy­draulic sys­tem to lock a set of clutches to en­able the cor­rect gear to be se­lected.</p>
    <p>What pro­vides the oil pres­sure is a built-in pump that re­lies solely on en­gine power. When dis­en­gaged from the en­gine, the pump can no longer de­velop suf­fi­cient pres­sure to work prop­erly.</p>
    <p>This is not a prob­lem when the car is sta­tion­ary. But on the move, this will re­sult in ac­cel­er­ated clutch wear at the in­stant the se­lec­tor is shifted from N back to D, as it takes a few sec­onds for hy­draulic pres­sure to build up be­fore a firm clutch-lock can be achieved.</p>
    <p>For the ben­e­fit of fuel econ­omy, a num­ber of au­to­matic trans­mis­sions these days are ca­pa­ble of coast­ing in neu­tral with­out any driver in­ter­ven­tion. This is pos­si­ble be­cause they are de­signed with a ded­i­cated pres­sure ac­cu­mu­la­tor that main­tains a con­stant hy­draulic pres­sure in the trans­mis­sions con­trol sys­tem for im­me­di­ate ac­tu­a­tion of gear se­lec­tion at the end of any coast-event.</p>
    <p>An elec­tronic con­trol unit or­ches­trates the se­lec­tion of</p>
    <p>N or D based on a num­ber of driv­ing pa­ram­e­ters.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­est­ing point to note is that the dual-clutch trans­mis­sion – like the di­rect-shift gear­box (DSG) found in most Volk­swa­gens – are, strictly speak­ing, not au­to­matic in the tra­di­tional sense. Their in­ter­nals are sim­i­lar to a man­ual gear­box and hence can be man­u­ally shifted to neu­tral when coast­ing, with­out caus­ing any dam­age.</p>
    <p>The prac­tice does save fuel such as when ap­proach­ing a traf­fic junc­tion where you know you will have to stop. How­ever, this is a driv­ing style that needs prac­tice as you need to be fully aware that you are in neu­tral and re­mem­ber to se­lect Drive once your coast­ing is done.</p>
    <p>The lat­est gen­er­a­tion of DSGs also in­cor­po­rates an au­to­matic coast-in-neu­tral mode where the driver is not re­quired to shift the gear se­lec­tor.</p>
