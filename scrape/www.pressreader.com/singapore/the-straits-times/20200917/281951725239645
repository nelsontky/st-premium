    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Two Boe­ing 737 Max crashes that killed all 346 pas­sen­gers and crew aboard were the “hor­rific cul­mi­na­tion” of fail­ures by the plane maker and Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FAA), a US House panel con­cluded after an 18-month in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>The crashes “were not the re­sult of a sin­gu­lar fail­ure, tech­ni­cal mis­take, or mis­man­aged event”, the House Trans­porta­tion and In­fra­struc­ture Com­mit­tee’s Demo­cratic ma­jor­ity said in its highly crit­i­cal re­port re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“They were the hor­rific cul­mi­na­tion of a se­ries of faulty tech­ni­cal as­sump­tions by Boe­ing’s en­gi­neers, a lack of trans­parency on the part of Boe­ing’s man­age­ment, and grossly in­suf­fi­cient over­sight by the FAA.”</p>
    <p>The 737 Max was grounded in March last year after the crash of Ethiopian Air­lines Flight 302 near Ad­dis Ababa, killing all 157 aboard.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2018, a Lion Air 737 Max had crashed i n In­done­sia, killing all 189 on board.</p>
    <p>“Boe­ing failed in its de­sign and devel­op­ment of the Max, and the FAA failed in its over­sight of Boe­ing and its cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of the air­craft,” the re­port said, de­tail­ing a se­ries of prob­lems in the plane’s de­sign and the FAA’s ap­proval of it.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing said it “learned many hard lessons as a com­pany from the ac­ci­dents... and from the mis­takes we have made”.</p>
    <p>It said it had co­op­er­ated fully with the House com­mit­tee and that re­vised de­sign work on the 737 Max had re­ceived in­ten­sive in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal re­view i nvolv­ing more than 375,000 engi­neer­ing and test­ing hours and 1,300 test flights.</p>
    <p>The FAA said in a state­ment that it would work with law­mak­ers “to im­ple­ment im­prove­ments iden­ti­fied in its re­port”.</p>
    <p>It added that it was “fo­cused on ad­vanc­ing over­all avi­a­tion safety by im­prov­ing our or­gan­i­sa­tion, pro­cesses and culture”.</p>
    <p>The re­port said Boe­ing made “faulty de­sign and per­for­mance as­sump­tions”, es­pe­cially re­gard­ing a key safety sys­tem called MCAS, which was linked to both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Air­lines crashes.</p>
    <p>MCAS, which was de­signed to help counter a ten­dency of the Max to pitch up, could be ac­ti­vated after</p>
    <p>data from only a sin­gle sen­sor.</p>
    <p>The FAA is re­quir­ing new safe­guards to MCAS, in­clud­ing re­quir­ing it to re­ceive data from two sen­sors, before it al­lows the 737 Max to re­turn to ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The re­port crit­i­cised Boe­ing for with­hold­ing “cru­cial in­for­ma­tion from the FAA, its cus­tomers and 737 Max pi­lots”, in­clud­ing “con­ceal­ing the very ex­is­tence of MCAS from 737 Max pi­lots”.</p>
    <p>The FAA “failed to en­sure the</p>
    <p>safety of the trav­el­ling pub­lic”, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers have pro­posed nu­mer­ous re­forms to re­struc­ture how the FAA over­sees air­craft cer­ti­fi­ca­tion. A Se­nate com­mit­tee was set to take up a re­form Bill yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers sug­gested Boe­ing was mo­ti­vated to cut costs and move quickly to get the 737 Max to mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“This is a tragedy that never should have hap­pened,” House Trans­porta­tion Com­mit­tee chair­man Peter DeFazio told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to take steps in our leg­is­la­tion to see that it never hap­pens again as we re­form the sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>While Mr DeFazio and other law­mak­ers have not called for a per­ma­nent ground­ing of the jet, the fa­ther of a woman who died in the Ethiopia crash said the re­port raised ques­tions about the plane’s re­turn to ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“The FAA should im­me­di­ately halt the re­cer­ti­fi­ca­tion process for the 737 Max in light of this re­port,” said Mr Michael Stumo, the fa­ther of Ms Samya Stumo.</p>
    <p>He ac­cused Boe­ing and the FAA of with­hold­ing in­for­ma­tion from the fam­i­lies of vic­tims in an emailed state­ment.</p>
    <p>SE­RIES OF FAIL­URES</p>
    <p>Boe­ing failed in its de­sign and devel­op­ment of the Max, and the FAA failed in its over­sight of Boe­ing and its cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of the air­craft.</p>
