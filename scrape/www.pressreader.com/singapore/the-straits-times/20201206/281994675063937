    <p>There were 12 slots avail­able in the first week­end of a busk­ing pilot scheme, but over 80 ap­pli­ca­tions, with buskers ea­ger to re­turn to per­form­ing for a live crowd.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh Jau Ch­ern, as­sis­tant direc­tor for ac­cess and so­cial par­tic­i­pa­tion at the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC), said there are more than 350 per­form­ers on the list of en­dorsed buskers. Of those, about 90 per cent of them are solo or paired acts, which is a cri­te­rion for par­tic­i­pat­ing in the trial.</p>
    <p>The trial be­gan on Fri­day and runs till Dec 19. The first week­end’s ses­sions were held at *Scape on Fri­day and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>From next week­end, there will also be acts per­form­ing at The Cen­tral in Clarke Quay.</p>
    <p>“We make our best ef­forts to en­sure that every avail­able busk­ing slot is oc­cu­pied by a dif­fer­ent busker,” said Ms Koh, speak­ing to the me­dia at *Scape yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Buskers will be able to play hour-long sets, in­clu­sive of a 15-minute pe­riod of sani­tis­ing be­tween each set.</p>
    <p>The per­form­ers have to wear masks and main­tain a safe dis­tance from the au­di­ence. They can talk to the au­di­ence but can­not phys­i­cally en­gage with them.</p>
    <p>Spa­ces have also been marked out in the sit­ting ar­eas sur­round­ing the stage, so that au­di­ence mem­bers can main­tain their dis­tance, and can hang out in groups of a max­i­mum of five.</p>
    <p>The tra­di­tional way of drop­ping cash as gra­tu­ities to the per­form</p>
    <p>ers has been re­placed by QR codes which au­di­ences can scan to make con­tact­less trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>This dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ini­tia­tive was a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic, said Ms Koh. NAC will also as­sist buskers to pivot to this e-col­lec­tion method if they need help.</p>
    <p>“For these tri­als to take place, we have had to en­sure that a ro­bust set of safe man­age­ment mea­sures are in place,” said Ms Koh.</p>
    <p>“We also en­sure that the venue part­ners are able to ac­tu­ally carry these through. And of course, from the per­spec­tive of the buskers, that they are com­fort­able</p>
    <p>in pre­sent­ing their per­for­mances and are still able to en­gage their au­di­ences.”</p>
    <p>When asked about the plans for the busk­ing sec­tor mov­ing for­ward, Ms Koh said NAC will col­late feed­back from the buskers and venue part­ners af­ter the trial, and also dis­cuss with the rel­e­vant gov­ern­ment au­thor­i­ties, be­fore de­cid­ing on the next step.</p>
    <p>“I think we def­i­nitely hope to be able to grad­u­ally see the re­turn of live busk­ing on the streets, of course with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place,” said Ms Koh.</p>
    <p>Mr Pa­trick Wan, 62, a ven­trilo</p>
    <p>quist and ma­gi­cian, said he was ex­cited to be per­form­ing for a live au­di­ence again af­ter nine months.</p>
    <p>Mr Wan, who has been busk­ing for more than 30 years, said he has been do­ing vir­tual shows once in a while to keep his skills sharp, but the ex­pe­ri­ence can­not com­pare with live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>“You see the in­ter­ac­tion, when the au­di­ence clapped and they danced – it’s just a mar­vel­lous ex­pe­ri­ence,” he said, af­ter his hour­long set yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Gui­tarist Alan Ang Mon­cayo, 21, said he prefers street busk­ing to vir­tual shows as it is eas­ier to at</p>
    <p>tract an au­di­ence among passersby than re­quir­ing peo­ple to search for a per­former’s live feed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity first-year stu­dent, who also per­formed yes­ter­day, pointed out that buskers’ in­come might be hit, as those who are not tech savvy may not be will­ing to take the trou­ble to fig­ure out how to give dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>“I think it is more con­ve­nient for peo­ple to just drop money... into a lit­tle bas­ket or what­ever you have,” he said.</p>
