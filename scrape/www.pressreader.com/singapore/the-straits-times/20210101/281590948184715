    <p>Vac­ci­na­tions in Sin­ga­pore be­gan on Wed­nes­day, with the first Pfizer-BioNTech jabs ad­min­is­tered to 40 health­care work­ers at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID).</p>
    <p>The Straits Times answers some ques­tions that have arisen around the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Q Will front-line and es­sen­tial work­ers be al­lowed to stay at their posts if they de­cline the in­jec­tion?</p>
    <p>A Though vac­ci­na­tion of health­care work­ers is not com­pul­sory, all lo­cal res­i­dents – health­care work­ers or the pub­lic – are urged to take the jab.</p>
    <p>There is no plan to al­ter the du­ties of health­care work­ers who do not get vac­ci­nated, said NCID ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Leo Yee Sin. Hos­pi­tals also con­tinue to com­ply with pre­ven­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>What pre­cau­tions need to be taken af­ter the in­jec­tion? Do pa­tients wait to en­sure they do not have side ef­fects?</p>
    <p>A The Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion is no different from other vac­ci­na­tions, said Prof Leo, adding: “It is rec­om­mended by the Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity to ob­serve (pa­tients) for 15 to 30 min­utes af­ter vac­ci­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>There are rest­ing spa­ces in full sight of health­care work­ers for pa­tients who have com­pleted their vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>How do we know the vac­ci­na­tion is work­ing? Some peo­ple have no ob­serv­able re­ac­tions, while oth­ers might have a mild or se­vere one.</p>
    <p>A There is no ev­i­dence to sug­gest that those with no or mild dis­com­fort are not pro­tected by the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The safety pro­file of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine is gen­er­ally con­sis­tent with other vac­cines used against other dis­eases, said Prof Leo, who was vac­ci­nated on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple may have side ef­fects such as pain, red­ness and swelling at the in­jec­tion site. Other side ef­fects in­clude fa­tigue, fever, headaches, mus­cle aches, chills, vom­it­ing, di­ar­rhoea and joint pain.</p>
    <p>While not ev­ery­one will ex­pe­ri­ence these, they are com­mon and ex­pected as part of the body’s nat­u­ral re­sponse, so as to build im­mu­nity against Covid-19. These side ef­fects are also usu­ally re­solved within a few days.</p>
    <p>As with other vac­cines, in rare cases, a per­son may ex­pe­ri­ence se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions, such as dif­fi­culty breath­ing, wheez­ing and swelling around the eyes and lips. Im­me­di­ate med­i­cal at­ten­tion must be sought.</p>
    <p>Also, any­one with a his­tory of ana­phy­laxis should not re­ceive the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Q Will the vac­ci­na­tion leave a keloid scar like the Bacil­lus Cal­mette-Guerin (BCG) vac­cine? A It is un­likely as this is an in­tra­mus­cu­lar in­jec­tion (like the in­fluenza vac­cine). There have been no re­ports of scar­ring.</p>
    <p>The BCG is a live at­ten­u­ated vac­cine – a vac­cine cre­ated by re­duc­ing the vir­u­lence of a pathogen.</p>
    <p>Q How is the vac­cine kept vi­able? A The NCID works closely with the Min­istry of Health to hold just enough doses be­fore they go to vac­ci­na­tion providers. Vac­cines can be stored at a tem­per­a­ture of 2 to 8 deg C for up to five days.</p>
