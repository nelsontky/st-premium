    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US gov­ern­ment has con­firmed that a re­cent hack­ing cam­paign af­fected its net­works and said the at­tack was “sig­nif­i­cant and on­go­ing”.</p>
    <p>Hack­ers be­lieved to be work­ing for Rus­sia have been mon­i­tor­ing in­ter­nal e-mail traf­fic at the US Trea­sury and Com­merce de­part­ments, Reuters re­ported this week, cit­ing peo­ple who said they feared the hacks un­cov­ered so far may be the tip of the ice­berg.</p>
    <p>“This is a de­vel­op­ing sit­u­a­tion and while we con­tinue to work to un­der­stand the full ex­tent of this cam­paign, we know this com­pro­mise has af­fected net­works within the fed­eral gov­ern­ment,” said a joint state­ment is­sued by the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI), the Cy­ber­se­cu­rity and In­fra­struc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency (Cisa), and the Of­fice of the Di­rec­tor of National In­tel­li­gence (Odni).</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy com­pany So­larWinds, which was the key step­ping­stone used by the hack­ers, has said that up to 18,000 of its cus­tomers had down­loaded a com­pro­mised soft­ware up­date that al­lowed hack­ers to spy un­no­ticed on busi­nesses and agen­cies for al­most nine months.</p>
    <p>“Over the course of the past sev­eral days, the FBI, Cisa and Odni have be­come aware of a sig­nif­i­cant and on­go­ing cy­ber-se­cu­rity cam­paign,” the joint state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“The FBI is in­ves­ti­gat­ing and gath­er­ing in­tel­li­gence in or­der to at­tribute, pur­sue and dis­rupt the re­spon­si­ble threat ac­tors.”</p>
    <p>The three agen­cies have formed a cy­ber uni­fied co­or­di­na­tion group to work on the US gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>White House national se­cu­rity ad­viser Robert O’Brien cut short a Euro­pean trip on Tues­day and re­turned to Wash­ing­ton to deal with the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the White House has con­vened ur­gent meet­ings of of­fi­cials across mul­ti­ple agen­cies to ad­dress the breach, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is hold­ing daily dis­cus­sions on the hack that in­clude rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the FBI, Odni, De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity and National Se­cu­rity Agency, ac­cord­ing to the source.</p>
    <p>The cus­tomers of Texas-based So­larWinds in­clude top gov­ern­ment agen­cies and Fortune 500 com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear what in­for­ma­tion the hack­ers were af­ter. No clas­si­fied sys­tems are be­lieved to have been ac­cessed, the source said.</p>
    <p>The De­part­ment of De­fence said in a state­ment that to date, it had no ev­i­dence its in­for­ma­tion net­works were com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to work with the whole-of-gov­ern­ment ef­fort to mit­i­gate cy­ber threats to the na­tion,” Vice-Ad­mi­ral Nancy Nor­ton, di­rec­tor of the De­fence In­for­ma­tion Sys­tems Agency, said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the daily meet­ings, a sep­a­rate US cy­ber re­sponse group is in­ves­ti­gat­ing the scope of the breach, which in­volved the de­part­ments of State, Com­merce, Trea­sury and Home­land Se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cials at var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies are pro­vid­ing in­for­ma­tion to in­ves­ti­ga­tors and co­or­di­nat­ing the re­sponse, the of­fi­cial said. It is not clear how long the clean-up and in­ves­tiga­tive ef­fort will take.</p>
