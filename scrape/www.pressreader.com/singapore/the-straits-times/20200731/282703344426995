    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • A United States court of ap­peals on Wednes­day ruled that ac­tress Ashley Judd has the right to pur­sue her sex­ual ha­rass­ment law­suit against dis­graced Hol­ly­wood pro­ducer Har­vey We­in­stein, over­turn­ing a lower court’s de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The three-judge panel on the Ninth Cir­cuit Court of Ap­peals found that We­in­stein, who is in prison, held power over the ac­tress and her ca­reer when he in­vited her to his room in a lux­ury Los An­ge­les ho­tel in the mid-1990s.</p>
    <p>The lower court had pre­vi­ously dis­missed Judd’s claim on grounds that the sex­ual ad­vances We­in­stein, 68, al­legedly made on her were not cov­ered by sex­ual ha­rass­ment laws re­lat­ing to a pro­fes­sional re­la­tion­ship since she was not his em­ployee. But it had al­lowed the ac­tress to pur­sue defama­tion claims against the pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>Judd, 52, was one of the first women to come for­ward with sex­ual ha­rass­ment claims against We­in­stein, and sued him in April 2018 over the in­ci­dent at his Bev­erly Hills ho­tel where she met him to dis­cuss po­ten­tial film roles.</p>
    <p>She al­leges that after she re­buffed his ad­vances, We­in­stein de­famed her and dam­aged her ca­reer by dis­cour­ag­ing The Lord Of The Rings (2001 to 2003) di­rec­tor Peter Jack­son from giv­ing her a role, claim­ing she was a “night­mare” to work with.</p>
    <p>Her lawyer Theodore Boutrous Jr hailed Wednes­day’s rul­ing, say­ing it marks an im­por­tant vic­tory for all vic­tims of sex­ual ha­rass­ment in pro­fes­sional re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>We­in­stein is cur­rently serv­ing 23 years in prison after he was found guilty of sex­ual as­sault and rape in Fe­bru­ary .</p>
