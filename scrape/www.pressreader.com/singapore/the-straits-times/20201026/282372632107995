    <p>Internatio­nal Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) pres­i­dent Thomas Bach has said the Olympic Games are not about pol­i­tics and must guard against be­com­ing a “mar­ket­place of demon­stra­tions”.</p>
    <p>Against the back­drop of the Black Lives Mat­ter (BLM) move­ment to protest against racial in­jus­tice, calls have i ncreased this year for a change to Rule 50 of the Olympic Char­ter, which bans any form of po­lit­i­cal protest dur­ing the Games.</p>
    <p>World Ath­let­ics chief Sebastian Coe said ear­lier this month he felt ath­letes should have the right to make ges­tures of po­lit­i­cal protest dur­ing the Games, con­trary to of­fi­cial IOC pol­icy, but Bach dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>“The Olympic Games are firstly about sport. The ath­letes per­son­ify the val­ues of ex­cel­lence, sol­i­dar­ity and peace,” he wrote in The Guardian. “They ex­press this in­clu­sive­ness and mu­tual re­spect also by be­ing po­lit­i­cally neu­tral on the field of play and dur­ing the cer­e­monies.</p>
    <p>“At times, this fo­cus on sport needs to be rec­on­ciled with the free­dom of speech all ath­letes also en­joy at the Games.</p>
    <p>“The uni­fy­ing power of the Games can only un­fold if ev­ery­one shows re­spect for and sol­i­dar­ity to one an­other. Oth­er­wise, the Games will de­scend into a mar­ket­place of demon­stra­tions of all kinds, di­vid­ing and not unit­ing the world.”</p>
    <p>Bach also claimed that he ex­pe­ri­enced the “po­lit­i­cal im­po­tence” of sport when West Ger­many was among sev­eral coun­tries to boy­cott the 1980 Moscow Games.</p>
    <p>“As chair of the West Ger­man ath­letes’ com­mis­sion, I strongly op­posed this boy­cott be­cause it pun­ished us for some­thing we had noth­ing to do with – the in­va­sion of Afghanista­n by the Soviet army,” he said.</p>
    <p>Bach, who helped West Ger­many win the team fenc­ing gold at Mon­treal 1976, added: “It’s no con­so­la­tion that we were ul­ti­mately proven right that this boy­cott not only pun­ished the wrong ones, but that it also had no po­lit­i­cal ef­fect... the Soviet army stayed nine more years in Afghanista­n. The Olympic Games are not about pol­i­tics. The IOC, as a civil non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion, is strictly po­lit­i­cally neu­tral at all times.”</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic forced the IOC to de­lay this year’s Tokyo Games un­til July next year.</p>
    <p>SPORT COMES FIRST</p>
    <p>The ath­letes per­son­ify the val­ues of ex­cel­lence, sol­i­dar­ity and peace. They ex­press this... by be­ing po­lit­i­cally neu­tral.</p>
