    <p>I was just about to look at a video a friend had sent me on Tues­day af­ter­noon – “the port seems to be burn­ing”, she said – when my whole build­ing shook, as if star­tled, by the deep­est boom I had ever heard. Un­easily, naively, I ran to the win­dow, then back to my desk to check for news.</p>
    <p>Then came a much big­ger boom, and the sound it­self seemed to splin­ter. There was shat­tered glass fly­ing ev­ery­where. Not think­ing but mov­ing, I ducked un­der my desk.</p>
    <p>When the world stopped crack­ing open, I could not see at first be­cause of the blood run­ning down my face. Af­ter blink­ing the blood from my eyes, I tried to take in the sight of my flat turned into a demolition site.</p>
    <p>My yel­low front door had been hurled on top of my din­ing ta­ble. I could not find my pass­port, or even any sturdy shoes.</p>
    <p>Later, some­one would tell me that Beirutis of her gen­er­a­tion, who had been raised dur­ing Le­banon’s 15-year civil war, in­stinc­tively ran into their hall­ways as soon as they heard the first blast, to escape the glass they knew would break.</p>
    <p>I was not so well-trained, but the Le­banese who would help me in the hours to come had the heart­break­ing steadi­ness that comes from hav­ing lived through count­less pre­vi­ous dis­as­ters. Nearly all of them were strangers, yet they treated me like a friend.</p>
    <p>When I got down­stairs, dodg­ing the enor­mous bro­ken win­dow that rested jaggedly in my stair­well, my neigh­bour­hood, with its grace­ful old-Beirut ar­chi­tec­ture and arched win­dows, looked like a pic­ture from the wars I had seen from afar – a mouth miss­ing all its teeth.</p>
    <p>Some­one pass­ing on a mo­tor­bike saw my bloody face and told me to hop on. When we could not get any closer to the hos­pi­tal, our way blocked by hillocks of bro­ken glass and stranded cars, I got off and started walk­ing.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one on the street seemed to be ei­ther bleed­ing from open gashes or swathed in makeshift ban­dages – all ex­cept one woman in a chic, back­less top lead­ing a small dog on a leash. Only an hour be­fore, we had all been walk­ing dogs or check­ing e-mail or shop­ping for gro­ceries. Only an hour be­fore, there had been no blood.</p>
    <p>As I neared the hos­pi­tal, el­derly pa­tients sat dazed in wheel­chairs in the streets, still hooked to their IV bags. A woman lay on the ground in front of the ex­ploded emer­gency room, her whole body drip­ping red, not mov­ing much.</p>
    <p>It was clear that they were not tak­ing new pa­tients, cer­tainly not any as com­par­a­tively lucky as I was.</p>
    <p>Some­one named Youssef saw me, sat me down and started clean­ing and ban­dag­ing my face. Once he was sat­is­fied I could walk, he left and I started wan­der­ing, try­ing to think of an­other hos­pi­tal I could try.</p>
    <p>I ran into a friend of a friend, some­one I had met only a few times be­fore, and he bandaged the rest of my wounds, dis­in­fect­ing the lac­er­a­tions with splashes of Le­banon’s na­tional liquor, an anise-flavoured drink called arak.</p>
    <p>Un­til then, I had not had more than the vaguest guesses about what might have hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Some­one was re­port­ing that fire­works had ex­ploded at the port.</p>
    <p>Much later, Le­banese of­fi­cials ac­knowl­edged that a large cache of ex­plo­sive ma­te­rial seized by the gov­ern­ment years ago was stored where the ex­plo­sions oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Sur­vivors walked by, mov­ing faster than the jammed-up traf­fic.</p>
    <p>To any­one who ap­peared un­hurt, peo­ple called out, “al­ham­dulil­lah al-salama”, or, roughly trans­lated, thank God for your safety.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the end of the night, af­ter my co-work­ers had found me, af­ter a pass­ing driver named Ralph had of­fered to take us to one of the few hos­pi­tals still ac­cept­ing pa­tients, af­ter a doc­tor had put 11 sta­ples in my fore­head and an­other sprin­kling on my leg and arms, peo­ple would be say­ing the same thing to me: “Thank God for your safety.”</p>
    <p>“Thank you, truly thank you,” I said in re­ply, and I did not mean just for the good wishes.</p>
