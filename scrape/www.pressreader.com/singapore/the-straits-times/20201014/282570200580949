    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s per­form­ing arts com­mu­nity has been bru­tally hit by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has left theatres empty and stage lights cold – and there is lit­tle hope on the hori­zon even as en­ter­tain­ment venues be­gin to re­open.</p>
    <p>The same pain felt by per­form­ers in Broad­way and the West End is be­ing ex­pe­ri­enced by artists i n Asia, even while gov­ern­ments there have had greater suc­cess at tack­ling the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The re­gion has had a much bet­ter track record of keep­ing down in­fec­tions, but the of­ten dras­tic so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures used to com­bat the virus have kept en­ter­tain­ment venues shut­tered.</p>
    <p>In her cramped Hong Kong apart­ment that has served as a stu­dio, stage and gym for the past six months, bal­le­rina Irene Lo fas­tens her pointe shoes and ef­fort­lessly lifts one leg into a full split.</p>
    <p>“We’re all miss­ing the stage so much,” she tells Agence FrancePres­se. “I did zero shows so far and most of my teach­ing has been can­celled.”</p>
    <p>Lo, 42, has mul­ti­ple lead roles un­der her belt, in­clud­ing Juliet in Romeo And Juliet and Clara in The Nutcracker. She is cur­rently miss­ing out on the HK$20,000 (S$3,500) a per­for­mance she used to make be­fore the virus hit, while video lessons bring in barely half of what she earned from in-per­son classes.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong bills it­self as one of Asia’s top per­form­ing arts cities, al­though its cul­tural dom­i­nance has been eclipsed in re­cent decades by the artis­tic rise of main­land China and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Artists and per­form­ers now com­plain that the city’s gov­ern­ment has pro­vided lit­tle in the way of vi­tal sub­si­dies or sup­port to keep their liveli­hoods go­ing.</p>
    <p>While the re­ces­sion-hit city has re­leased bil­lions in sub­si­dies and job re­ten­tion schemes, many per­form­ers are free­lancers and are in­el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>Rock Fang, a 42-year-old hip-hop dancer and teacher, com­plains: “In the en­ter­tain­ment cir­cle, there’s no help at all.”</p>
    <p>He says he has lost 80 per cent of his in­come since the virus struck. He adds that his sole pay­out has been a one-off pay­ment of HK$10,000 that all per­ma­nent res­i­dents re­ceived.</p>
    <p>Ms Kitty Wong, 24, dreamt of the lime­light af­ter grad­u­at­ing from the­atre school in May, but is work­ing in a liquor shop to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>She still prac­tises at home, recit­ing by heart her favourite mono­logue from the play Saint Joan.</p>
    <p>For now, all she can do is wait and hope au­di­ences one day re­turn to theatres. “I would say maybe it’s not my time,” she says. “So I will just wait un­til my time comes.”</p>
