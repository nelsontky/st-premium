    <p>The Ta­gin com­mu­nity in the In­dian state of Arunachal Pradesh that neigh­bours China is of­ten caught in the cross hairs of con­flict, as the Asian gi­ants face off at the bor­der. Five Ta­gin were re­cently de­tained by the Chi­nese army af­ter stray­ing across the bor­der.</p>
    <p>UNDEFINED BOR­DER</p>
    <p>There is no struc­ture to de­fine the bor­der. When peo­ple set out to hunt, ev­ery place looks like ours, the hills look the same on both sides... This con­flict has ad­versely af­fected our life­style and lo­cals are now scared to go on these hunts.</p>
    <p>MR DADU PADING, spokesman for All Up­per Suban­siri District Stu­dents Union, on why lo­cal res­i­dents wan­der across the bor­der.</p>
    <p>Hunt­ing and for­ag­ing in the rich forests of the Hi­malayas has been an age-old liveli­hood prac­tice for the Ta­gin peo­ple in Arunachal Pradesh, an east­ern In­dian state that bor­ders China. It was one such ex­pe­di­tion that 16-year-old Prasad Rin­gling left for on Aug 19.</p>
    <p>This time, his el­der brother Prakash had an ad­di­tional word of cau­tion for him. “Be care­ful, re­la­tions be­tween In­dia and China are not good,” he told him. The younger brother promised to be watch­ful.</p>
    <p>Fate, how­ever, had some­thing else in store. Prasad and four of his team mem­bers strayed across the por­ous and dis­puted bor­der that runs through this hilly ter­rain into China, fol­low­ing which they were de­tained by the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army.</p>
    <p>Prasad’s fam­ily spent sev­eral anx­ious days wor­ry­ing as he and his friends were re­ported “miss­ing”.</p>
    <p>China de­nied hav­ing any in­for­ma­tion about them, un­til it handed the five boys over to In­dia on Sept 12.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond in­stance of a Ta­gin be­ing de­tained by China this year. On April 7, 21-year-old Tog­ley Singkam was re­leased af­ter nearly three weeks of cap­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>He too had strayed across the bor­der while on a hunt.</p>
    <p>These two “ab­duc­tions” by China have brought into fo­cus the prob­lems faced by those who live in the shad­ows of an on­go­ing Indo-Chi­nese ri­valry in Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
    <p>The Ta­gin peo­ple, who num­ber around 70,000, in­habit a sparsely pop­u­lated and poorly devel­oped part of the state along the undefined fron­tier with China.</p>
    <p>Faced with poor in­fra­struc­ture and lack of job op­por­tu­ni­ties, many res­i­dents, who are not able to mi­grate to towns deeper into In­dian ter­ri­tory, con­tinue to live off the land that is con­tested by both these Asian neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>The Ta­gin youth of­ten spend a few weeks at a stretch in nearby forests, for­ag­ing for medic­i­nal herbs and hunt­ing an­i­mals to sup­ple­ment in­come for their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing on these hunts is not just a mat­ter of tra­di­tion, it is also a com­pul­sion,” Mr Prakash Rin­gling, a 24-year-old eco­nomics stu­dent, told The Straits Times on the phone from Da­por­ijo in Up­per Suban­siri district. “It is how we sup­port our par­ents in the ab­sence of other job op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>But this tra­di­tional prac­tice along an un­de­mar­cated bor­der has put the Ta­gin in the cross hairs of a mod­ern geopo­lit­i­cal con­flict.</p>
    <p>“There is no struc­ture to de­fine the bor­der. When peo­ple set out to hunt, ev­ery place looks like ours, the hills look the same on both sides,” said Mr Dadu Pading, spokesman for All Up­per Suban­siri District Stu­dents Union, ex­plain­ing why some lo­cal folks in­ad­ver­tently cross over to the other side.</p>
    <p>“This con­flict has ad­versely af­fected our life­style and lo­cals are now scared to go on these hunts. Many of the herbs we col­lect from these forests are needed to treat ill­nesses lo­cally, given the ab­sence of mod­ern med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties in the vil­lages,” he added.</p>
    <p>His brother-in-law was one of the five de­tained by China. They are cur­rently un­der­go­ing a 14-day gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine, fol­low­ing which they will be re­leased.</p>
    <p>Be­sides de­mar­ca­tion of the bor­der, res­i­dents in­ter­viewed said they need bet­ter road con­nec­tiv­ity and job op­por­tu­ni­ties, along with other ser­vices such as telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion con­nec­tiv­ity, power sup­ply as well as health and ed­u­ca­tional cen­tres.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of mod­ern ameni­ties, res­i­dents from many vil­lages close to the fron­tier have moved to towns over the years, leav­ing their pre­vi­ous home towns un­in­hab­ited. “This makes these ar­eas more vul­ner­a­ble to Chi­nese in­cur­sions,” said Mr Tabu Pak­tung, pres­i­dent of Ta­gin Cul­tural So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The five boys are from in and around Nacho, a small town in Up­per Suban­siri district. It is around 120km from Da­por­ijo, the district head­quar­ters, but the jour­ney takes around six hours be­cause of poor road con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Kanto Danggen, deputy com­mis­sioner of Up­per Suban­siri district, said the gov­ern­ment has launched devel­op­ment schemes in the district, be­sides ad­di­tional pro­grammes tar­get­ing bor­der re­gions. “One must keep in mind that this re­gion is very re­mote and sparsely pop­u­lated, which makes it very dif­fi­cult for us to pro­vide all the fa­cil­i­ties,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>There also have been calls to re­cruit more lo­cal res­i­dents to the In­dian Army, in­clud­ing through a fullfledge­d “Arunachal Reg­i­ment”.</p>
    <p>This is a de­mand en­dorsed by Mr Ni­nong Er­ing, a for­mer fed­eral min­is­ter and cur­rent mem­ber of the Arunachal Pradesh state assem­bly from the In­dian Na­tional Congress.</p>
    <p>“Our boys can guard our fron­tiers bet­ter. They are much more ex­pe­ri­enced, they know the ter­rain, the to­pog­ra­phy and they have no prob­lems in sur­viv­ing in harsh weather or on lo­cal pro­duce from the jun­gles,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Prakash Rin­gling, mean­while, anx­iously awaits his brother’s re­turn, although he is aware that Prasad may have to go back to the tra­di­tional Ta­gin prac­tice of hunt­ing and for­ag­ing that is one of the few known means of mak­ing a liv­ing in Nacho. “He will have to re­turn (on an­other ex­pe­di­tion) one day,” he said.</p>
