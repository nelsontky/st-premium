    <p>NEW YORK • Amer­i­can co­me­dian Bill Cosby, who is serv­ing a threeto 10-year prison term, has filed a new ap­peal against his con­vic­tion for drug­ging and sex­u­ally as­sault­ing a wo­man 15 years ago.</p>
    <p>In court doc­u­ments filed on Tues­day with Penn­syl­va­nia’s Supreme Court, Cosby’s lawyers ar­gue that five women should not have been al­lowed to give ev­i­dence at his trial as wit­nesses. They say their “decades-old” al­le­ga­tions, which were not part of the charges, had prej­u­diced the jury.</p>
    <p>The lawyers also ar­gue it was “fun­da­men­tally un­fair” the de­po­si­tion tes­ti­mony Cosby, 83, gave in a civil case re­gard­ing his use of seda­tive drugs and his sex­ual be­hav­iours in the 1970s was heard in court.</p>
    <p>They say Cosby be­lieved the tes­ti­mony was im­mune from pros­e­cu­tion when he gave it.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor fell from grace as al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct emerged against him. He was found guilty in 2018 of as­sault­ing for­mer univer­sity ad­min­is­tra­tor An­drea Con­stand, 47, at his Philadel­phia man­sion.</p>
    <p>It was the first celebrity trial and first guilty ver­dict for sex­ual as­sault since the ad­vent of the #MeToo move­ment.</p>
    <p>A Penn­syl­va­nia judge sen­tenced the ac­tor to a min­i­mum of 31/ years</p>
    <p>2 in prison on three counts of ag­gra­vated in­de­cent as­sault.</p>
    <p>Al­though more than 60 women say they had been vic­tims of sex­ual as­sault by Cosby, he was tried crim­i­nally only for Ms Con­stand’s as­sault, since the statute of lim­i­ta­tions had ex­pired in the other cases.</p>
    <p>A dozen women who say they were vic­tims of Cosby have filed civil suits against the ac­tor seek­ing com­pen­sa­tion for dam­ages.</p>
