    <p>NUM­BER OF PINES CLUB MEM­BERS SU­ING MO­TOR­ING TY­COON AND HIS COM­PANY FOR DOWN­SIZ­ING THEIR CLUB­HOUSE |</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 162 mem­bers of The Pines club are su­ing mo­tor­ing ty­coon Peter Kwee and his com­pany, Exk­lu­siv Re­sorts, for down­siz­ing their club­house at 30 Stevens Road and re­lo­cat­ing some fa­cil­i­ties to a shared site in Tanah Merah.</p>
    <p>Exk­lu­siv Re­sorts is the club’s pro­pri­etor. Mr Kwee, who was in court yes­ter­day, is the com­pany’s direc­tor.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Kwee’s lawyers, the club mem­bers are seek­ing dam­ages of more than $110,000 each.</p>
    <p>The mem­bers are ac­cus­ing Mr Kwee of breach­ing con­trac­tual agree­ments, mis­lead­ing them into think­ing the premises would re­main in Stevens Road, and fail­ing to tell them about the pro­posed re­de­vel­op­ment, their lawyers told the High Court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The mem­bers are rep­re­sented by Mr Lau Kah Hee and Mr Fikri Yeong from B.C. Lim & Lau, who told The Straits Times more mem­bers may be coming for­ward as claimants this week.</p>
    <p>High Court judge Chua Lee Ming said dur­ing the lawyers’ open­ing state­ments that the claims on con­tract breaches rest on whether the plain­tiffs can con­vince him that Mr Kwee had no right to change the con­tract in this way or to change the club’s lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwee’s lawyers, Ra­jah & Tann Sin­ga­pore’s Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Foo Xian Fong, called the claims base­less, with Mr Nair ar­gu­ing that un­der the club’s rules and reg­u­la­tions, the pro­pri­etor re­serves the right to vary the fa­cil­i­ties. “These pro­ceed­ings are an op­por­tunis­tic gam­ble by a small group of mem­bers to seek a wind­fall,” they said in their open­ing state­ment, not­ing that the club has about 1,490 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>They said these mem­bers would have paid $9,900 or $12,000, de­pend­ing on the mem­ber­ship type, for a 30-year mem­ber­ship which would ex­pire by the end of 2032.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the club mem­bers, they were told at a di­a­logue ses­sion in Au­gust 2012 that the club­house needed to be re­de­vel­oped and the premises were un­der­utilised. They said they were also told the club would re­main a city club, in a cen­tral area of the city.</p>
    <p>The club was closed for ren­o­va­tion in 2013, and the Stevens Road premises were sold to prop­erty de­vel­oper Ox­ley Gem. Novo­tel Sin­ga­pore and Mer­cure Sin­ga­pore ho­tels opened on the plot in 2017.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwee’s lawyers said mem­bers have been al­lowed to use the fa­cil­i­ties at the La­guna Na­tional Golf and Coun­try Club and the Dusit Thani La­guna Sin­ga­pore re­sort lo­cated in Tanah Merah.</p>
    <p>The club has also se­cured the lease of a smaller club­house at 30 Stevens Road that is set to open early next year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the plain­tiffs’ first wit­ness, club mem­ber Lim Seng Hoo, a direc­tor of a com­pany that sells mea­sur­ing in­stru­ments, took the stand.</p>
    <p>Mr Nair, dur­ing his cross-ex­am­i­na­tion, asked Mr Lim, as some­one who ran his own com­pany, whether he was ex­pected to have his oper­a­tions stay in the same place for­ever, and if he needed his cus­tomers’ per­mis­sion to re­lo­cate his busi­ness oper­a­tions. Mr Lim re­sponded no to both ques­tions.</p>
    <p>While Mr Lim agreed the pro­pri­etor has a right to vary the club’s fa­cil­i­ties, he said: “I did not ex­pect (the fa­cil­i­ties) to just van­ish.”</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues today.</p>
    <p>The club was closed for ren­o­va­tion in 2013, and the 30 Stevens Road premises were sold to prop­erty de­vel­oper Ox­ley Gem. Novo­tel Sin­ga­pore and Mer­cure Sin­ga­pore ho­tels opened on the plot in 2017.</p>
