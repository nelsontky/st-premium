    <p>A doc­tor ac­cused of fail­ing to give way to other ve­hi­cles at a cross-junc­tion al­legedly struck a mo­tor­cy­cle, caus­ing se­ri­ous in­juries to a young man and his fe­male pil­lion rider.</p>
    <p>Roger Pang Heng Mun, 75, who prac­tises at The Ming Clinic in Cam­den Med­i­cal Cen­tre, has been charged with caus­ing griev­ous hurt to the two by driv­ing his car in a neg­li­gent man­ner.</p>
    <p>His case was last heard in a dis­trict court on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>A check on the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity’s web­site re­veals that the Sin­ga­porean doc­tor is a direc­tor of clinic op­er­a­tor Medis­tar Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>A Business Times re­port in June last year stated that The Ming Clinic is op­er­ated by the firm.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Pang al­legedly failed to give way to other ve­hi­cles while mak­ing a right turn at the sig­nalised crossjunc­tion of Bukit Ba­tok East Av­enue 6 and Bukit Ba­tok East Av­enue 2 around 8pm on Oct 11 last year.</p>
    <p>His car is said to have struck the mo­tor­cy­cle which was trav­el­ling straight from the op­po­site di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Both the 21-year-old man and his 22-year-old fe­male pil­lion rider were in­jured fol­low­ing the ac­ci­dent. Court doc­u­ments do not re­veal de­tails about their in­juries.</p>
    <p>Pang’s bail has been set at $10,000 and the case has been ad­journed to Dec 16.</p>
    <p>Offenders con­victed of caus­ing griev­ous hurt by neg­li­gent driv­ing can be jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000.</p>
