    <p>When Mr Calvin Goh started cre­at­ing dig­i­tal art, he didn’t put much thought into the sto­ry­telling and sym­bol­ism be­hind it, as long as what he cre­ated looked aes­thet­i­cally pleas­ing.</p>
    <p>But cur­ricu­lum mod­ule The En­ter­tain­ment In­dus­tries changed his per­spec­tive; he learned about dif­fer­ent tech­niques on how to cap­ture an au­di­ence’s at­ten­tion, get them in­ter­ested and elicit a re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Now, when­ever he cre­ates a new piece of work, he tries to put more thought be­hind the sym­bol­ism of el­e­ments used in a scene or artwork.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing a pas­sion into a ca­reer</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old is cur­rently a fi­nal year stu­dent at the Man­age­ment De­vel­op­ment In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore (MDIS) pur­su­ing a Bach­e­lor of Arts (Hons) Me­dia and Dig­i­tal Prac­tice ( Top-up), awarded by the Univer­sity of Portsmouth in the</p>
    <p>United King­dom.</p>
    <p>He has al­ways en­joyed cre­at­ing art from a young age, and study­ing dig­i­tal me­dia was the way for­ward to turn his pas­sion into a ca­reer.</p>
    <p>His in­ter­est in dig­i­tal me­dia started when a good friend from sec­ondary school showed him mo­tion graph­ics videos he had made. Mr Goh was so im­pressed that he de­cided to pur­sue fur­ther stud­ies in dig­i­tal me­dia.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sec­ondary school, Mr Goh at­tended the In­ter­ac­tive and Dig­i­tal Me­dia course at Repub­lic Polytech­nic, where he learned the ba­sics of in­ter­ac­tive and dig­i­tal me­dia.</p>
    <p>At the same time, he also picked up graphic de­sign and video edit­ing skills from YouTube tu­to­ri­als.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­plet­ing his Na­tional Ser­vice, he started stream­ing his de­sign process on live plat­form Twitch and slowly gained recog­ni­tion on­line. This even­tu­ally led to rec­om­men­da­tions and com­mis­sions for de­sign work.</p>
    <p>Now, Mr Goh free­lances as a graphic de­signer while study­ing at MDIS.</p>
    <p>“The abil­ity to ex­press and trans­late what I per­ceive in my mind into dig­i­tal artwork is re­ally fas­ci­nat­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>He is glad that he found a suit­able univer­sity to pur­sue his pas­sion and learn more about the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Study­ing Me­dia and Dig­i­tal Prac­tice at MDIS has helped him un­der­stand the in­dus­try, and he has gained deeper in­sights into me­dia cul­ture and how au­di­ences con­sume me­dia.</p>
    <p>He plans to con­tinue free­lanc­ing as a graphic de­signer and hopes to find a job in the film in­dus­try when he grad­u­ates in May.</p>
    <p>“I have great ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the work that goes into film­mak­ing and hope to con­tinue my pas­sion to cre­ate great films and videos,” he says.</p>
