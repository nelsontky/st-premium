    <p>The Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) did its best to keep vot­ers safe on Polling Day and it is too early to say if in­fec­tions would oc­cur as a re­sult of vot­ers hav­ing to wait in line for up­wards of an hour in some places, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Whether or not any­thing hap­pens af­ter this, whether there will be any cases emerg­ing, we will not know now... So I think let’s not jump to the con­clu­sion just be­cause we see queues form­ing,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>“Queues form ev­ery­where, not just when peo­ple go and cast the vote. Queue­ing per se is not an ac­tiv­ity that will nec­es­sar­ily cause the trans­mis­sion of the virus.”</p>
    <p>The vot­ing process in the elec­tion on July 10 could have been length­ened be­cause of the ex­tra pre­cau­tions that had to be taken.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the ELD did its best in im­ple­ment­ing safety mea­sures, such as pro­vid­ing hand sani­tis­ers and spac­ing vot­ers out.</p>
    <p>He also said the crowds of peo­ple who gath­ered in some places to cel­e­brate as re­sults came in may have put them­selves and oth­ers at risk of con­tract­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Ideally, they would have prac­tised safe dis­tanc­ing, the peo­ple who were there. They know who they are. But I think the mo­ment got the bet­ter of them, and they per­haps for­got some of these re­quire­ments,” said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the Covid-19 task force with Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong. “Any time any­one de­cides to aban­don cau­tion... they put them­selves and they put the whole coun­try at risk.”</p>
    <p>When asked about the stance on en­force­ment, given that po­lice of­fi­cers on the ground ap­peared to have held back, Mr Wong said there was no change to en­force­ment of safe dis­tanc­ing rules, but stressed in­di­vid­ual re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>He said some coun­tries that had suc­cess­fully con­trolled the coro­n­avirus out­break are see­ing a ma­jor resur­gence in the num­ber of cases, due to lapses such as in­di­vid­u­als fail­ing to ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ken­neth Mak, direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices at the Min­istry of Health, said the task force had been keep­ing “a very close watch” to en­sure there would not be a rise in the num­ber of cases as Sin­ga­pore moved from one phase to an­other.</p>
    <p>“I’m not fo­cused en­tirely just on the GE or post-GE set­ting,” he added. “If peo­ple are com­pla­cent and they lose that dis­ci­pline, we can eas­ily see clus­ters form.”</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions “can oc­cur re­gard­less of whether or not there’s an elec­tion”. “What is im­por­tant is each and ev­ery one of us plays our part to re­main vig­i­lant, even now and go­ing for­ward,” he added.</p>
