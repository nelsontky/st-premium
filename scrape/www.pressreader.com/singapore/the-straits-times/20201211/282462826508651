    <p>MADRID Lo­cal me­dia re­ports had said Zine­dine Zi­dane would be fired if Real Madrid failed to reach the knock­out phase of the Cham­pi­ons League for the first time.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish cham­pi­ons had to bet­ter Shakhtar Donetsk’s re­sult at In­ter Mi­lan (0-0) or drop into the Europa League for the first time since the 1994-95 sea­son.</p>
    <p>With Zi­dane’s job on the line de­spite hav­ing won 11 tro­phies across two spells, Real rose to the oc­ca­sion, strolling to a 2-0 vic­tory over Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach to seal their place in the last 16 as Group B winners on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>A pair of first-half head­ers by their top scorer Karim Ben­zema put the Ger­man Bun­desliga side away in what Zi­dane hailed as their best dis­play of a stop-start cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“We played a spec­tac­u­lar game from the first minute to the last,” the French­man told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“We in­ter­preted the game very well, I think it was the most com­plete per­for­mance of the sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Zi­dane’s men had be­gun the evening third in Group B but fin­ished top to en­sure they will be seeded in Mon­day’s draw for the last 16.</p>
    <p>Prais­ing the 13-time Euro­pean Cup winners’ ca­pac­ity to per­form when backed into a cor­ner, he also em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of win­ning the group and avoid­ing the best sides left in the com­pe­ti­tion in the next round.</p>
    <p>“We don’t just play well un­der pres­sure, we have played well in other games too but it’s true that this team has this abil­ity to come into their own when the go­ing gets tough,” Zi­dane said.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been a player and it’s im­pos­si­ble to play like this all the time. We try to but some­times, it doesn’t come off. I’m very happy for the play­ers, be­cause they are the most im­por­tant mem­bers of this squad.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It was fun­da­men­tal that we fin­ished first, it’s the first time that has hap­pened since I’ve been coach.”</p>
    <p>While Zi­dane has staved off the im­me­di­ate pres­sure, his fu­ture will again be called into ques­tion if Real fail to beat La Liga lead­ers Atletico Madrid, who are six points ahead on 26 points and have a game in hand, in the league to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Diego Sime­one’s men are in form and on Wed­nes­day, also qual­i­fied for the last 16, fin­ish­ing run­ners-up to Group A winners and Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Bay­ern Mu­nich fol­low­ing their 2-0 vic­tory at Red Bull Salzburg.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing he was still un­der the gun, Zi­dane said: “No, I don’t think I’ll ever be the Alex Fer­gu­son of Real Madrid. That’s for sure. What I re­ally want is to en­joy what I’m do­ing.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know how long I’ll be here for. I don’t even think about that. I just think about the day-to­day and the luck I have to be here at this great club with these great play­ers. Even in dif­fi­cult mo­ments, I like it. Not only just when we win. I want to stay for a while longer.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the de­feat, Glad­bach also pro­gressed to the knock­out stage for the first time in their third par­tic­i­pa­tion in the com­pe­ti­tion, while Shakhtar dropped into the Europa League, mean­ing In­ter will have no Euro­pean foot­ball for the rest of the term.</p>
