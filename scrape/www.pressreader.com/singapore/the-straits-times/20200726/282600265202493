    <p>He is grate­ful to WSG for the help in get­ting his cur­rent po­si­tion, and said:</p>
    <p>“I was catch­ing up reg­u­larly with my ex-work col­leagues who were also search­ing for jobs. Af­ter tak­ing cour­ses, do­ing vol­un­teer work for the Sil­ver Gen­er­a­tion Of­fice while search­ing for jobs on my own for eight months, one of my bud­dies, who was fa­mil­iar with WSG, rec­om­mended that I tap on their vast re­sources, work­shops and net­work. I de­cided to con­tact WSG who as­signed Ingeus to guide me on my job search jour­ney.</p>
    <p>“Ingeus had sup­ported me for more than three months be­fore the in­ter­views ma­te­ri­alised into a job of­fer for me.”</p>
    <p>Ingeus is a Ca­reer Match­ing Provider ap­pointed by WSG to aug­ment WSG’s suite of ca­reer ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The ca­reer coaches at Ingeus de­vise ac­tion plans for their clients and help them de­fine their job goals.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew pinned his suc­cess on the emo­tional sup­port from his ca­reer coach and pro­fes­sional tips from the work­shops he at­tended.</p>
    <p>“Ingeus of­fers a num­ber of very use­ful ca­reer and de­vel­op­ment ser­vices such as ca­reer plan­ning, CV writ­ing and in­ter­view­ing skills work­shops, LinkedIn and Net­work­ing ses­sions, and re­fer­rals to their large net­work of part­ners and hir­ing com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Their pro­fes­sional team mem­bers con­duct one-on-one per­sonal coach­ing. Most of them are highly ex­pe­ri­enced in Hu­man Re­sources and Talent Ac­qui­si­tion, and sev­eral serve pas­sion­ately be­cause of their ‘call­ings’ to con­trib­ute to so­ci­ety,” Mr Chew added.</p>
    <p>Vast net­work</p>
    <p>With its vast net­works, Ingeus is able to ad­vise their clients on the in­ter­view­ing com­pany’s back­ground and job re­quire­ments, as well as re­fer them for po­ten­tial new po­si­tions and in­ter­views, such as the Project Man­ager po­si­tion in Jani­son Asia for Mr Chew.</p>
    <p>WSG and Ingeus of­fer ca­reer match­ing ser­vices, which in­clude pro­fes­sional and emo­tional sup­port in ca­reer coach­ing, de­vel­op­ment and job search.</p>
    <p>Their suc­cess is ev­i­dent in Mr Chew’s stor y and his tongue -in- cheek part­ing com­ments:</p>
    <p>“WSG’s ser­vices are avail­able to all Sin­ga­pore­ans and PRs. I should have tapped on their ex­cel­lent ser­vices sooner.”</p>
