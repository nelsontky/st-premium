    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You can see the fu­ture more clearly. Granted that it still looks murky, but you can make plans with greater as­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20) Peo­ple are harder to han­dle, thanks to a new op­por­tu­nity that is not avail­able to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Fight for what is yours.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You need to be alone to think through some is­sues that have been both­er­ing you for a while. Force your­self to con­cen­trate.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22) Flex­i­bil­ity is key, so get ready to con­tort your­self. Ad­just plans and con­nect with peo­ple who need to hear about evolv­ing ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You have been tak­ing things the wrong way, so try some­thing dif­fer­ent. You can dream up some new ideas.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22) Go be­yond fault-find­ing. It may be much harder to of­fer cre­ative crit­i­cism that im­proves the sit­u­a­tion, but you still have to try.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are hav­ing fun. It is just the right level of shenani­gans and busi­ness to keep you en­gaged and in­ter­ested long af­ter ev­ery­one else gets tired.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Show that you can think flex­i­bly so that the right peo­ple know you are con­sid­er­ing al­ter­na­tives. Things are look­ing good.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your un­der­stand­ing of a dif­fi­cult prob­lem grows dra­mat­i­cally as new in­for­ma­tion comes to light. You can form a plan to take care of it.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You ei­ther find a small sum of money some­where un­ex­pected or get some other, sim­i­lar boost. How­ever, watch out for hid­den strings.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) You look per­fect to the right per­son, which could mean a new love, a new job or a new friend is on the way.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You may not be sure what you want next. Things are a bit un­steady and it is not a good idea for you to rock the boat even more.</p>
