    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia will pro­vide free English lan­guage classes to migrants and will quiz new cit­i­zens on “Aus­tralian val­ues” to try to pro­mote co­he­sion and pre­vent for­eign states – par­tic­u­larly China – from tight­en­ing their grips on their di­as­pora com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the changes on Friday, act­ing Im­mi­gra­tion and Mul­ti­cul­tural Af­fairs Min­is­ter Alan Tudge told the Na­tional Press Club: “De­spite now be­ing proud Aus­tralians, some com­mu­ni­ties are still seen by their former home coun­tries as ‘their di­as­pora’ – to be ha­rassed or ex­ploited to fur­ther the na­tional cause.</p>
    <p>“Some who crit­i­cise their former coun­try are si­lenced through threats and in­tim­i­da­tion... oth­ers are per­suaded or forced to mon­i­tor or ha­rass mem­bers of their own com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity of­fi­cials in Aus­tralia are re­port­edly con­cerned about ef­forts by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party to mon­i­tor, con­trol and in­flu­ence Chi­nese stu­dents and Chi­nese-lan­guage me­dia out­lets.</p>
    <p>About 1.2 mil­lion peo­ple with Chi­nese an­ces­try live in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Mr Tudge ex­pressed con­cern over the poor English lan­guage skills of some migrants, say­ing that</p>
    <p>“with­out English lan­guage skills, migrants are less likely to get a job, less likely to in­te­grate and less likely to par­tic­i­pate in our democ­racy”.</p>
    <p>“Ma­lign in­for­ma­tion or pro­pa­ganda can be spread through mul­ti­cul­tural me­dia, in­clud­ing for­eign­lan­guage me­dia con­trolled or funded by state play­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment will now over­haul its A$1 bil­lion (S$1 bil­lion) pro­gramme to teach English to adult migrants. Any mi­grant will now be able to at­tend free English lan­guage classes un­til they have ac­quired “func­tional English”. Cur­rently, migrants can ac­cess up to 510 hours of free classes within five years of their mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Abul Rizvi, a former se­nior of­fi­cial of the Im­mi­gra­tion Depart­ment, told SBS News: “The main prob­lem is that many of the migrants who want to at­tend classes are also search­ing for work and are of­ten work­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the govern­ment also plans to change tests for new cit­i­zens to in­clude ques­tions on Aus­tralian val­ues.</p>
    <p>In the year to June 30, a to­tal of 204,817 peo­ple from over 200 coun­tries be­came Aus­tralian cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Of these, 38,209 were from In­dia, 25,011 were from China and 14,764 were from the Philip­pines.</p>
