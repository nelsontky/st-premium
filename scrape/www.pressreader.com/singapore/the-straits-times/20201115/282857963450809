    <p>LONDON • No­vak Djokovic is bid­ding to win the ATP Fi­nals for a record-equalling sixth ti me as Rafael Nadal chases the big­gest ti­tle miss­ing from his glit­ter­ing re­sume at London’s O2 Arena.</p>
    <p>The top eight avail­able play­ers in the men’s rank­ings – with six-time cham­pion Roger Fed­erer ab­sent as he re­cov­ers from knee surgery – will com­pete at the end-of-sea­son tour­na­ment, which starts to­day be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>The two round-robin groups have been named Tokyo 1970 and London 2020 on the 50th an­niver­sary of the first stag­ing of the event.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Djokovic is in Group Tokyo along­side Daniil Medvedev, 2018 win­ner Alexan­der Zverev and Ar­gen­tinian debu­tant Diego Schwartz­man.</p>
    <p>Nadal will com­pete against de­fend­ing cham­pion Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas, Do­minic Thiem and An­drey Rublev, who is ap­pear­ing for the first time, in Group London.</p>
    <p>The four best-placed play­ers from the round-robin stage will progress to the semi-fi­nals of the event, tak­ing place in London for the fi­nal year be­fore a move to Turin in Italy.</p>
    <p>Djokovic, who re­cently equalled</p>
    <p>Pete Sam­pras’ record of six yearend No. 1 fin­ishes, has lost just three matches this sea­son, with one of those his de­fault at the US Open.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old Serb, who has not won the London event since 2015, is look­ing to end his sea­son on a high at the eight-man event.</p>
    <p>“Com­ing into the tour­na­ment and know­ing that I have clinched the year-end No. 1 re­leases some of the pres­sure, def­i­nitely,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But, at the same time, it doesn’t change what I hope to achieve in this tour­na­ment and why I’m here.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally want to win ev­ery sin­gle match that I play and try to get my hands on the tro­phy and I want this tro­phy as much as any­body.”</p>
    <p>Nadal, who pul­verised 17-time Grand Slam win­ner Djokovic in the French Open fi­nal last month to pull level with Fed­erer on 20, has qual­i­fied for the ATP Fi­nals for a record 16 con­sec­u­tive years.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish world No. 2 is well aware of his short­com­ings on in­door hard courts – only one of his 86 tro­phies has come on the sur­face.</p>
    <p>“I think I am able to play a lit­tle bit bet­ter the last cou­ple of years in­doors than what I did at the be­gin­ning of my ca­reer with­out a doubt. But that’s the numbers and I can’t say some­thing dif­fer­ent,” said the 34-year-old two-time fi­nal­ist. “I hope to change that this week.”</p>
    <p>De­spite his lack of in­door suc­cess, the short­ened sea­son could count in Nadal’s favour – he has been forced to with­draw from the ATP Fi­nals six times pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Last year’s win­ner Tsit­si­pas, who beat Thiem in the fi­nal, comes into the tour­na­ment after early ex­its in Vienna and Paris.</p>
    <p>“Very happy to be back, that’s for sure,” said the Greek world No. 6.</p>
    <p>“It’s like a meet­ing spot for those that had a good year to be back here, cel­e­brate their hard work, their ded­i­ca­tion to the sport.”</p>
    <p>Aus­trian Thiem broke his Grand Slam duck at the US Open in Septem­ber, beating Zverev in the fi­nal, and the world No. 3 said he now felt as com­fort­able on hard courts as he does on clay.</p>
    <p>Medvedev, who lost all three matches on his de­but in London last year, comes into the tour­na­ment as one of the form horses after winning the Paris Masters last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The ATP Fi­nals also fea­ture the top eight dou­bles teams. The top seeds are US Open cham­pi­ons and French Open fi­nal­ists Mate Pavic and Bruno Soares.</p>
