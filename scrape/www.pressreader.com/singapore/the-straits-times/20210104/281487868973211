    <p>Work­ers were yes­ter­day seen re­mov­ing a fallen 22m-tall her­itage tree at Fort Can­ning Hill.</p>
    <p>In­tense rain­fall over the first two days of the new year top­pled the tree on Satur­day morn­ing, as it be­came a ca­su­alty of soil fail­ure caused by wa­ter­log­ging.</p>
    <p>Parts of an out­door es­ca­la­tor con­nect­ing Ju­bilee Park near Fort Can­ning MRT sta­tion to the hill’s peak were dam­aged in the fall.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board said there was no one near the tree when it fell. The es­ca­la­tor has been closed off to the pub­lic un­til fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>The tree, a Fi­cus kurzii, also known as Burmese banyan, is a rare species that is dis­trib­uted in scat­tered lo­ca­tions through­out western parts of South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Af­ter two con­sec­u­tive days of down­pours that trig­gered land­slips and flood­ing around the is­land, the rain fi­nally be­gan to ease yes­ter­day, with sliv­ers of blue sky and streaks of sun­shine emerg­ing in some spots for the first time this year.</p>
    <p>The mer­cury inched up and wa­ter lev­els re­ceded in flooded ar­eas, though the weather re­mained cool and windy with an av­er­age daily tem­per­a­ture of 24 deg C at the Changi cli­mate sta­tion as at 5pm. The low­est daily min­i­mum tem­per­a­ture was 22.3 deg C in Jurong West yes­ter­day, up from the 21.1 deg C recorded in New­ton on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Works to re­pair the dam­age in­flicted kicked off, with ar­eas in Have­lock, Fort Can­ning and Loyang cor­doned off as re­pairs were done.</p>
    <p>At Fort Can­ning Park, heavy storms sent a 22m-tall tree on the slope of Fort Can­ning Hill crash­ing down on Satur­day morn­ing, with some of its branches land­ing on the shel­tered out­door es­ca­la­tor that con­nects Fort Can­ning MRT sta­tion to the hill’s peak.</p>
    <p>Mr Ryan Lee, group direc­tor of Fort Can­ning Park and Is­tana at the Na­tional Parks Board, said the her­itage tree – a Fi­cus kurzii or Burmese banyan – was up­rooted as a re­sult of soil fail­ure due to the con­sec­u­tive days of heavy rain.</p>
    <p>There was no one in the vicin­ity at that time, but the fallen tree dam­aged a sec­tion of the es­ca­la­tor, which has been closed till fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>A video cir­cu­lated on so­cial me­dia also showed a land­slip tak­ing place in Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the land­slip, which oc­curred be­side the slip road of Tampines Expressway head­ing to­wards Loyang Av­enue on Satur­day, caused seven drain rail­ings of a mon­soon drain to give way.</p>
    <p>“Based on our pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions, the sta­bil­ity of the slip road is cur­rently not af­fected,” said the Land Trans­port Author­ity in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The slip road has been closed since Satur­day night as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, to fa­cil­i­tate re­pair works on the slope.</p>
    <p>Heavy rain also led to a land­slip on Satur­day on a slope that con­nects Ou­tram Se­condary School on York Hill to Fu­rama River Front ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity (SLA) said its pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer has as­sessed that the slope is sta­ble, and its con­trac­tor has cor­doned off the area and cov­ered the slope with can­vas sheets to pre­vent more soil from slip­ping in the in­terim be­fore re­pair works are car­ried out.</p>
    <p>There were also mi­nor land­slips on Kusu Is­land, Lazarus Is­land and St John’s Is­land on Satur­day. “For pub­lic safety, the af­fected ar­eas have been cor­doned off un­til fur-ther no­tice. The pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer will as­sess and rec­om­mend the ap­pro­pri­ate re­pair works,” said the SLA, which ad­vised the pub­lic to stay away from such sites when the weather is bad.</p>
    <p>The high­est daily to­tal rain­fall recorded was 6.6mm in Simei and East Coast Park­way as at 5pm yes­ter­day, a sharp drop from the 210.6mm recorded at the Changi cli­mate sta­tion on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>At D’Best Fish­ing in Pasir Ris Town Park, which was flooded on Satur­day, wa­ter lev­els be­gan re­ced­ing.</p>
    <p>But Mr Peter Lew, man­ag­ing direc­tor of Sin­ga­pore’s only com­mer­cial salt­wa­ter fish­ing pond, said the flood had dam­aged cables and di­luted the salin­ity of the pond, which could kill the fish.</p>
    <p>“Some are al­ready float­ing on the sur­face, which means they are dy­ing... I’ve also lost money as many cus­tomers have called off their fish­ing plans due to the weather con­di­tions,” he added.</p>
    <p>For the next few days, thun­dery show­ers are ex­pected in the af­ter­noon, and the tem­per­a­ture is fore­cast to range be­tween 24 deg C and 33 deg C, said the Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day.</p>
