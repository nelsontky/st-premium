    <p>My rab­bit is a four-year-old Hol­land lop mixed an­gora dwarf.</p>
    <p>My friends say that I should have it neutered so that it will have a longer life­span. Is that true? I did some read­ing on this and found that, ap­par­ently, it is bet­ter for my bunny’s emo­tions if it was neutered.</p>
    <p>May I also ask what is the quan­tity of hay, fresh veg­eta­bles or pel­lets I should pro­vide for my rab­bit’s nu­tri­tion?</p>
    <p>For groom­ing, I am able to cut its nails and fur. But do I still need to take it to the groomer for ear and gland clean­ing? Shynna Neo</p>
    <p>These are great ques­tions. Rea­sons to ster­ilise your rab­bit in­clude re­duc­ing the risk of uter­ine cancer and other uter­ine dis­eases in fe­male rabbits. It can also help re­duce prob­lem be­hav­iours such as ag­gres­sion and urine-spray­ing in both male and fe­male rabbits.</p>
    <p>Bun­nies should be given a diet of mostly hay – for adults, ti­mothy hay and other grass hay are pre­ferred over al­fafa hay, un­less other­wise ad­vised by your vet­eri­nar­ian – as it pro­motes a healthy gas­troin­testi­nal sys­tem and pro­motes proper wear of their teeth, which grows con­tin­u­ously through­out their life­time.</p>
    <p>An­other im­por­tant part of your rab­bit’s diet is a va­ri­ety of green leafy veg­eta­bles, avoid­ing those that are toxic to bun­nies, such as pota­toes and ice­berg let­tuce.</p>
    <p>Pel­lets should com­prise only a small por­tion of the diet and should be given in amounts rec­om­mended by your vet­eri­nar­ian based on your rab­bit’s body con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Fruit and car­rots should be given only as treats in very small amounts. Pel­lets, fruits and car­rots are high in calo­ries and lower in fi­bre, which can re­sult in obe­sity and dis­rupt nor­mal gas­troin­testi­nal func­tion if con­sumed ex­ces­sively.</p>
    <p>If your rab­bit is healthy and ac­tively groom­ing it­self, it should be able to stay rel­a­tively clean. You can also help by brush­ing it reg­u­larly and mak­ing sure there is no mat­ted fur.</p>
