    <p>Af­ter three years of ne­go­ti­a­tions with the Pa­cific Al­liance of four South Amer­i­can na­tions, Singapore stands ready to sign a free trade agree­ment (FTA) with them in the new year. That is the sub­stan­tial out­come of last Fri­day’s maiden par­tic­i­pa­tion by Singapore in the Al­liance’s sum­mit, held as a vir­tual fo­rum this year. Singapore had been in­vited to at­tend as a Can­di­date As­so­ciate State of the Al­liance. Host Chile, along with Mex­ico, Colom­bia and Peru are the four in­volved, and col­lec­tively are the eighth-largest econ­omy and sev­enth-largest ex­porter in the world. In 2019, Singapore’s to­tal trade in goods with the al­liance was $6.1 bil­lion, a third of its to­tal trade in goods with Latin Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>While three years of gov­ern­ment ef­fort for this amount of trade may seem a lot, Singapore is clearly plac­ing a long-term bet on the re­gion. With the ex­cep­tion of Colom­bia, the other three Al­liance na­tions are mem­bers of the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP), the high-qual­ity trade agree­ment mid­wifed by Ja­pan as a suc­ces­sor to the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, which failed when the United States pulled out of ne­go­ti­a­tions fol­low­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s elec­tion to of­fice in 2016. Other can­di­date states for as­so­ciate sta­tus in the Al­liance in­clude CPTPP mem­bers Aus­tralia, New Zealand and Canada, as well as Costa Rica, Ecuador and Panama.</p>
    <p>Against a back­ground of stalling trade lib­er­al­i­sa­tion and the weapon­i­sa­tion of mar­ket ac­cess, Singapore and other like-minded na­tions have long thought of FTAs as a use­ful way to keep trade flow­ing and ex­pand­ing. This think­ing led to the land­mark Agree­ment be­tween New Zealand and Singapore on a Closer Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship, Singapore’s first bi­lat­eral FTA which came into ef­fect in Jan­uary 2001. To­day, there are more than two dozen bi­lat­eral and pluri­lat­eral FTAs in­volv­ing Singapore, and more are un­der ne­go­ti­a­tion. The Trade and In­dus­try Min­istry es­ti­mates that in 2018, FTAs helped Singapore com­pa­nies ben­e­fit from $1.2 bil­lion in tar­iff con­ces­sions when selling to over­seas mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Nat­u­rally, not all FTAs are of even qual­ity. For in­stance, the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship it signed last month with other Asean mem­bers and di­a­logue part­ners is less am­bi­tious than the CPTPP. Like­wise, an­nual two-way trade with Sri Lanka may be just over $1 bil­lion, but Singapore has nev­er­the­less re­garded it im­por­tant to sign an FTA with it, partly to gain pro­tec­tion for Singapore in­vest­ments in that is­land na­tion. As for the FTA with the Pa­cific Al­liance, it stems from two stim­uli. First, it is im­por­tant to not lose mo­men­tum in trade. Sec­ond, it is even more crit­i­cal to be firmly rooted in fu­ture sup­ply chains, and South Amer­ica, Mex­ico par­tic­u­larly, could be cen­tral to those links.</p>
