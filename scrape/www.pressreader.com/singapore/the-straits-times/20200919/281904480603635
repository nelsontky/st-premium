    <p>Ja­pan’s first lead­er­ship change in nearly eight years saw Mr Yoshi­hide Suga elected in Par­lia­ment this week as the coun­try’s 99th prime min­is­ter. He takes over at a chal­leng­ing time – Covid-19 has shrunk the econ­omy by nearly 28 per cent on an an­nual ba­sis in the sec­ond quar­ter. The fis­cal stim­u­lus of over US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion), or 40 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, is a hefty ad­di­tion to an al­ready size­able na­tional debt, and the 2020 Sum­mer Olympics, which were to have marked na­tional re­gen­er­a­tion un­der Mr Shinzo Abe, had to be put on hold. But the de­but ap­proval rat­ings of the new gov­ern­ment, ac­cord­ing to a Ky­odo News poll, stand at 66.4 per cent, higher than Mr Abe’s when he took of­fice in 2012. Mr Suga, the son of a farmer from the job-scarce, de­pop­u­lated Akita pre­fec­ture, is ex­pected to tread in Mr Abe’s foot­steps. His pri­or­i­ties in­clude re­viv­ing ar­eas in de­cline like his own home town, dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and dereg­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga is sup­pos­edly less at home with for­eign pol­icy. He could prof­itably take a leaf from Mr Abe’s play­book, es­pe­cially on mat­ters that are key to South-east Asia. Mr Abe led on trade, cham­pi­oning the suc­ces­sor to the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship af­ter the US with­drawal in 2017. He also deep­ened Ja­pan’s strate­gic links with Asean, loop­ing it into the Indo-Pa­cific pol­icy au­thored by Washington. Ja­pan out­spends China in re­gional in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments. And af­ter the pan­demic broke, Ja­pan nudged its com­pa­nies to shift from China to South-east Asia to di­ver­sify their sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>That need not mean alien­at­ing China, which is Ja­pan’s largest trad­ing part­ner. Mr Abe had man­aged to square the cir­cle: cul­ti­vat­ing a per­sonal bond with United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump while steering Ja­pan to some of the best years of its re­la­tion­ship with China, in­clud­ing a path-break­ing visit to Bei­jing in 2018 for the first bi­lat­eral sum­mit in seven years. Covid-19 put a ques­tion mark on Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s re­turn visit planned for April this year, which would have been a mile­stone as the first trip by a Chi­nese leader since 2008. It is up to Mr Suga to match Mr Abe’s states­man­ship, an act that Bei­jing is count­ing on, go­ing by its warm wel­come for the new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>A Joe Bi­den US pres­i­dency may re­store the tra­di­tional vibes be­tween Ja­pan and its military ally. But it will not al­ter the arc of the un­fold­ing de­fence strat­egy to dis­cour­age Chi­nese as­sertive­ness in the East China Sea. Ja­pan will likely ac­quire Amer­i­can cruise mis­siles for pre-emp­tive strikes, much to Bei­jing’s ire. Mr Suga is said to be par­tial to Mr Abe’s un­met goal of al­low­ing greater play to Ja­pan’s SelfDe­fence Forces. The new PM, should he con­tinue to lead Ja­pan be­yond Oc­to­ber 2021 when the term ex­pires, can bring his own touch to the of­fice by mod­er­at­ing the more con­tro­ver­sial el­e­ments of Mr Abe’s legacy. Trust­wor­thi­ness, Mr Suga’s call­ing card with Ja­panese vot­ers, can prove trans­for­ma­tional in the global arena too.</p>
