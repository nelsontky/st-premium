    <p>SAN JOSE (UNITED STATES) • Two people were stabbed to death and oth­ers in­jured on Sun­day night at a church in San Jose, Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>There were “mul­ti­ple stab­bing vic­tims”, the po­lice said in a post on Twit­ter. No ser­vices were be­ing held at the time of the at­tack at Grace Bap­tist Church, and the po­lice added that “un­housed in­di­vid­u­als” had been brought to the church out of the cold.</p>
    <p>The church is near the cam­pus of San Jose State Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Mayor Sam Lic­cardo had ini­tially said on Twit­ter, be­fore delet­ing the post: “Our hearts go out to the fam­i­lies of the two com­mu­nity mem­bers who have suc­cumbed to stab­bing wounds in the at­tack at Grace Bap­tist Church down­town tonight. SJPD (San Jose Po­lice Depart­ment) has ar­rested the sus­pect.</p>
    <p>“Oth­ers are se­ri­ously wounded, & we keep them in our prayers.”</p>
    <p>He later tweeted that a state­ment would be made soon and the po­lice said they had made no ar­rests. No fur­ther in­for­ma­tion on a mo­tive or a sus­pect was im­me­di­ately avail­able.</p>
    <p>San Jose, a city of a lit­tle more than one mil­lion people, is in Sil­i­con Val­ley, a ma­jor tech hub in the Bay Area of Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
