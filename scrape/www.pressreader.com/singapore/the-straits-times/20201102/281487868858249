    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong plant­ing a bon­sai tree at a rooftop gar­den in Hougang yes­ter­day morn­ing to mark Tree Plant­ing Da y. Due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, the event was held with­out par­tic­i­pa­tion from res­i­dents for the first time in its 49-year his­tory. It was also the first tree plant­ing event to be held at a rooftop gar­den and the first time bon­sai trees were planted. Tree Plant­ing Day be­gan on Nov 7, 1971, when then Act­ing Prime Min­is­ter Goh Keng Swee planted a rain tree on the sum­mit of Mount Faber.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong planted bon­sai trees at a rooftop gar­den in Hougang yes­ter­day morn­ing to mark Tree Plant­ing Day, an oc­ca­sion that scored sev­eral firsts in the his­tory of the an­nual event.</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, the event was held with­out par­tic­i­pa­tion from res­i­dents for the first time in its 49-year his­tory.</p>
    <p>It was also the first such event to be held at a rooftop gar­den and the first time bon­sai trees were planted.</p>
    <p>Armed with shov­els, PM Lee and fel­low Ang Mo Kio GRC MPs – Mr Dar­ryl David, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Ms Na­dia Ahmad Samdin and Ms Ng Ling Ling – planted 10 Podocar­pus macro­phyl­lus trees, com­monly known as the Bud­dhist pine, in their bon­sai form at the rooftop gar­den of the multi-storey carpark at Block 933 Hougang Av­enue 9.</p>
    <p>Ke­bun Baru MP Henry Kwek and Yio Chu Kang MP Yip Hon Weng joined them at the event.</p>
    <p>The ori­gins of the event go back to June 16, 1963, when found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew started a tree-plant­ing cam­paign by plant­ing a mem­pat tree in Far­rer Cir­cus.</p>
    <p>The first Tree Plant­ing Day was held on Nov 7, 1971, when then act­ing prime min­is­ter Goh Keng Swee planted a rain tree on the sum­mit of Mount Faber.</p>
    <p>The an­nual event is usu­ally held on the first Sun­day of Novem­ber. Each town coun­cil usu­ally holds tree-plant­ing day ac­tiv­i­ties with its own Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The event yes­ter­day was livestream­ed on the Ang Mo Kio Town Coun­cil’s Face­book page. It was viewed about 13,000 times as of 11.30am yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Bud­dhist pine is a trop­i­cal, ever­green tree that can grow up to 20m tall. It has dark green and nar­row leaves. It also re­sponds well to prun­ing and trim­ming, and is largely re­sis­tant to pests and dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Due to their sturdy fea­tures, bon­sai plants pose min­i­mal safety haz­ards, es­pe­cially when faced with strong winds dur­ing the rainy sea­son.</p>
    <p>Af­ter plant­ing the trees, PM Lee vis­ited the rooftop gar­den’s herbs and spices area, which houses plants such as basil, rose­mary, pan­dan and lemon­grass, and was pre­sented with var­i­ous leaves and seeds from the gar­den.</p>
    <p>From to­day, Ang Mo Kio Town Coun­cil will give out 160 bags of salad crop seedlings. Par­tic­i­pants can go to the town coun­cil’s Face­book page for de­tails on how to get the bags.</p>
