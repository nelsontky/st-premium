    <p>INGREDIENT­S</p>
    <p>500g bread flour</p>
    <p>80g caster su­gar</p>
    <p>10g in­stant yeast</p>
    <p>15g ac­ti­vated char­coal pow­der</p>
    <p>1/ tsp salt 2</p>
    <p>2 large eggs</p>
    <p>200g whole milk, luke­warm</p>
    <p>70g but­ter, melted</p>
    <p>Pump­kin spread</p>
    <p>300g fresh pump­kin, kabocha squash or but­ter­nut squash, weighed af­ter re­mov­ing the skin and seeds</p>
    <p>30g palm su­gar, or to taste</p>
    <p>100ml co­conut cream, store­bought</p>
    <p>1/ tsp salt 2</p>
    <p>Fill­ing for choco­late cherry char­coal buns</p>
    <p>200g dark choco­late, no more than 70 per cent co­coa</p>
    <p>120g dried tart cher­ries</p>
    <p>METHOD</p>
    <p>1. Weigh out the flour into the bowl of your elec­tric mixer or into a large mix­ing bowl. Add in the su­gar, yeast, char­coal pow­der and salt, be­ing care­ful not to have the yeast and salt touch, as salt can de­ac­ti­vate yeast. Whisk all the dry ingredient­s to­gether.</p>
    <p>2. Add the eggs, milk and but­ter. If us­ing an elec­tric mixer, screw the bowl onto the mixer fit­ted with the dough hook and knead at low speed for two min­utes. Stop the ma­chine. Use a bench scraper to scrape the dough off the hook. Scrape the sides of the bowl to gather all the dough in the mid­dle and flip the dough over. This is to make sure there are no pock­ets of dry flour in the dough.</p>
    <p>3. Knead at low speed for 12 min­utes, stop­ping the ma­chine every three min­utes to scrape the dough off the hook. Gather the dough in the mid­dle and flip it over. This is to make sure the dough is evenly kneaded. At the end of the knead­ing, you should have a shiny, smooth and sticky dough.</p>
    <p>4. De­tach the dough hook and un­screw the bowl. Scrape the dough off the hook into the bowl. Scrape the sides of the bowl to gather the dough into a ball. Cover the bowl with plas­tic wrap and proof 60 min­utes. There is no need to oil the bowl.</p>
    <p>5. If knead­ing by hand, mix the dry and wet ingredient­s in the mix­ing bowl un­til they come to­gether. Re­move from the bowl and knead 12 to 14 min­utes, un­til the dough is smooth and shiny.</p>
    <p>To make a char­coal loaf</p>
    <p>1. Pre­pare a Pull­man loaf tin by lin­ing all four sides with bak­ing pa­per so the pa­per ex­tends be­yond the top of the tin by about 2cm. This is in­sur­ance against the bread stick­ing to the pan. The pan I use mea­sures 19.5cm x 10.5cm x 10.5cm.</p>
    <p>2. Af­ter the first proof, gen­tly de­flate the dough in the bowl and scrape it out onto a smooth work surface. There is no need to flour the surface. Roll the dough out into a rec­tan­gle mea­sur­ing about 18cm x 15cm.</p>
    <p>3. Start­ing at the top, roll the dough to­wards you, pulling gen­tly up­wards as you go along, to make a tight coil. Pinch the edges firmly to seal and trans­fer the dough into the pre­pared pan. Cover with a tea towel and let it rise 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>4. About 30 min­utes into the sec­ond proof­ing, pre­heat the oven to</p>
    <p>180 deg C. Po­si­tion the oven rack at the bot­tom third of the oven.</p>
    <p>5. When the bread has had its sec­ond proof, place it in the oven and bake 30 to 35 min­utes.</p>
    <p>6. Let it rest in the pan for five min­utes af­ter bak­ing, then lift the loaf out us­ing the pa­per over-hang. Re­move the pa­per and place the bread on a metal rack to cool com­pletely.</p>
    <p>7. Store up to two days in an air­tight con­tainer at room tem­per­a­ture. To store longer, slice the bread once it has cooled com­pletely. Wrap each slice in plas­tic wrap, place the wrapped slices in a re­seal­able freezer bag and freeze up to one month. Be­fore eat­ing, un­wrap and toast from frozen.</p>
    <p>To make pump­kin spread</p>
    <p>1. Cut the pump­kin into chunks and steam over high heat un­til a fork pierces through the pieces eas­ily, about 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>2. Pour out the liq­uid that has col­lected in the bowl. Mash the pump­kin with a fork and place in a saucepan, prefer­ably non-stick. Slice or grate the palm su­gar. Add that to the mashed pump­kin, to­gether with the co­conut cream and salt.</p>
    <p>3. Cook over medium-low heat, stir­ring con­stantly un­til the ingredient­s are well mixed and thick­ened, about 20 min­utes. Trans­fer into a glass or ce­ramic con­tainer with a cover. Cool and re­frig­er­ate up to five days.</p>
    <p>To make choco­late cherry char­coal buns</p>
    <p>1. Chop the choco­late into chunks and place in a bowl. Weigh out the cher­ries into an­other bowl. Line two large bak­ing trays with bak­ing pa­per. 2. Af­ter the first proof, gen­tly de­flate the dough. Di­vide into 16 por­tions, each weigh­ing 58 to 60g.</p>
    <p>3. Place each por­tion onto a smooth work surface – there is no need to flour it – and pat out into a cir­cle. Pile pieces of choco­late in the mid­dle, top with five to six dried cher­ries (left).</p>
    <p>4. Us­ing a bench scraper, gather up the dough and pinch firmly to seal (left, be­low). Flip the dough over and make it round by cup­ping your hand over the dough and mov­ing in a cir­cu­lar mo­tion, much like you would use a com­puter mouse.</p>
    <p>5. Re­peat for the rest of the dough and di­vide the buns be­tween the two trays. Make sure the buns are 5cm to 6cm apart. Cover with a tea towel and let them proof 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>6. About 30 min­utes into the sec­ond proof, pre­heat the oven to 180 deg C and ar­range two oven racks at the bot­tom and mid­dle of the oven.</p>
    <p>7. When the buns have proofed, place the trays in the oven. Af­ter 10 min­utes, swop the trays so the bot­tom one is now on top and the top one is at the bot­tom. Bake an­other 15 min­utes.</p>
    <p>8. Re­move from the oven and trans­fer the buns onto a metal cool­ing rack. Keeps up to three days at room tem­per­a­ture. Re­heat one to two min­utes in a toaster oven be­fore eat­ing.</p>
