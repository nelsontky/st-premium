    <p>Live mu­sic dur­ing wor­ship ser­vices will re­sume at 16 re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions from Saturday in a pi­lot project.</p>
    <p>Another pi­lot scheme will in­volve hav­ing up to 250 peo­ple in wor­ship ser­vices, said Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong yes­ter­day, in pro­vid­ing de­tails of the lat­est round of Covid-19 re­stric­tions eas­ing.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that live mu­sic is an in­te­gral part of how peo­ple prac­tise their faith, he said that the pi­lot can “scale up” if Covid-19 in­fec­tions here sta­bilise. “We’ll see how that goes and then de­cide what are the learn­ing points,” said Mr Tong, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law, af­ter a visit to the Cen­tral Sikh Tem­ple.</p>
    <p>He was pro­vid­ing de­tails of how more re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties could safely re­sume fol­low­ing last Wed­nes­day’s an­nounce­ment of the fur­ther eas­ing of Covid-19 safety mea­sures, al­low­ing up to 100 peo­ple to con­gre­gate from this Saturday – dou­ble the cur­rent limit.</p>
    <p>Among the 16 or­gan­i­sa­tions in the pi­lot are the Cen­tral Sikh Tem­ple,</p>
    <p>Covenant Evan­gel­i­cal Free Church in Wood­lands, the Sin­ga­pore Bud­dhist Lodge, Lorong Koo Chye Sheng Hong Tem­ple As­so­ci­a­tion, Sri Layan Sithi Vi­naya­gar Tem­ple and St Joseph’s Church in Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) said they were se­lected af­ter con­sul­ta­tions with mem­bers of the Na­tional Steer­ing Com­mit­tee on Racial and Re­li­gious Har­mony.</p>
    <p>Un­der the first pi­lot, up to 10 mu­si­cians or singers will be al­lowed on stage, with a max­i­mum of five peo­ple un­masked at any one time.</p>
    <p>If sing­ing is con­ducted in an in­door space, then only two can be un­masked.</p>
    <p>While all masked in­di­vid­u­als have to keep a me­tre apart, those un­masked have to main­tain 2m from one another.</p>
    <p>There should also be at least 3m be­tween the singers and the con­gre­ga­tion. If the height of a stage places them at a higher van­tage point, then an even far­ther safe dis­tance is en­cour­aged.</p>
    <p>The con­gre­ga­tion has to re­main masked dur­ing wor­ship ser­vices</p>
    <p>and can­not sing, although they can give spo­ken re­sponses.</p>
    <p>Con­gre­ga­tional ser­vices must be</p>
    <p>split into two zones of up to 50 peo­ple each with no min­gling be­tween groups, even though up to 100 peo</p>
    <p>ple may at­tend ser­vices from Saturday.</p>
    <p>For places with more struc­tured ser­vices, such as churches, mosques and gur­d­waras, the two zones must be sep­a­rated by a phys­i­cal par­ti­tion or bar­rier, with sep­a­rate en­trances and ex­its or stag­gered en­try and exit tim­ings for each zone, said MCCY.</p>
    <p>Places with more tran­sient wor­ship set­tings – such as Bud­dhist, Taoist and Hindu tem­ples – should en­sure no crowd­ing at com­mon ar­eas and in the prayer halls, and safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween wor­ship­pers.</p>
    <p>The ex­ist­ing caps on fu­neral-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties will re­main at 30 peo­ple and on re­li­gious classes at 50 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions that have safely con­ducted ser­vices for 100 peo­ple may ap­ply to the MCCY to par­tic­i­pate in the pi­lot to in­crease crowd lim­its to 250.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants will be as­sessed based on the lay­out of their premises and crowd man­age­ment mea­sures, among other con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Baljit Singh, pres­i­dent of the Cen­tral Sikh Tem­ple board, said: “We are ex­tremely grate­ful that... a higher level of nor­malcy re­turns.”</p>
