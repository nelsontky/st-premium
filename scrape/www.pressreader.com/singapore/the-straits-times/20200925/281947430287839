    <p>PARIS • Rais­ing the earth’s av­er­age sur­face tem­per­a­ture by an­other de­gree Cel­sius will lock in 2.5m of sea level rise from Antarc­tica alone, and an ex­tra 3 deg C will see the frozen con­ti­nent lift oceans by 6.5m, sci­en­tists have warned.</p>
    <p>These dev­as­tat­ing in­creases in the global wa­ter­line – enough to crip­ple coastal cities from Mum­bai to Mi­ami and dis­place hundreds of mil­lions of peo­ple – would un­fold over hundreds to thou­sands of years.</p>
    <p>But the man-made green­house gas emis­sions that could guar­an­tee such an out­come are on track to oc­cur on a timescale mea­sured in decades, the sci­en­tists re­ported in the jour­nal Na­ture.</p>
    <p>One of the study’s most alarm­ing con­clu­sions is that sea level hikes caused by a dis­in­te­grat­ing Antarc­tic ice sheet – which holds enough frozen wa­ter to boost oceans by 58m – would be­come dra­mat­i­cally larger with each ad­di­tional de­gree of warm­ing.</p>
    <p>Sea level rise, for ex­am­ple, would av­er­age about 1.3m for each of the first two de­grees above pre-in­dus­trial lev­els.</p>
    <p>The earth’s av­er­age sur­face tem­per­a­ture has al­ready gone up 1.1 deg C since the late 19th cen­tury, enough to en­hance the sever­ity of deadly heat­waves, droughts and trop­i­cal cy­clones.</p>
    <p>But from 2 deg C to 6 deg C above that bench­mark, the in­crease in sea level would dou­ble to 2.4m for each de­gree of warm­ing.</p>
    <p>At the up­per end of that range, cli­mate change would dev­as­tate civil­i­sa­tion and re­draw the map of the world’s coast­lines, sci­en­tists say.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that, each added de­gree would re­sult in 10m more, push­ing the en­tire ice sheet past the point of no re­turn and lift­ing oceans to lev­els not seen for mil­lions of years.</p>
    <p>“In the end, it is our burn­ing of coal and oil that de­ter­mines if and when crit­i­cal tem­per­a­ture thresh­olds in Antarc­tica are crossed,” Pro­fes­sor An­ders Lev­er­mann, a cli­mate sci­en­tist at the Pots­dam In­sti­tute for Cli­mate Im­pact Re­search and a co-au­thor of the study, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“And even if the ice loss hap­pens on long time scales, the re­spec­tive car­bon diox­ide lev­els can al­ready be reached in the near fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The ice sheet atop West Antarc­tica will be the first to go, eroded not so much by warm air but rather warm sea wa­ter seep­ing be­low the un­der­belly of glaciers and erod­ing their ocean-fac­ing edges, known as ice shelves.</p>
    <p>“That makes glaciers the size of Florida slide into the ocean,” noted Dr Torsten Al­brecht, an­other co-au­thor and also a re­searcher at the Pots­dam In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>Once global warm­ing crosses the 6 deg C thresh­old, the dy­namic changes.</p>
    <p>“As the gi­gan­tic moun­tains of ice” – up to 5km thick – “slowly sink to lower heights where the air is warmer, this leads to more melt at the ice sur­face,” Dr Al­brecht added.</p>
    <p>This process has al­ready cre­ated rag­ing rivers of melt­wa­ter on the Green­land ice sheet, which saw a net loss of more than half a tril­lion tonnes in mass last year alone.</p>
    <p>“This very im­por­tant and timely study makes clear the ur­gent need to sta­bilise sur­face tem­per­a­ture rise in line with Paris Agree­ment tar­gets so as to limit the to­tal com­mit­ted sea level rise to a few me­tres,” said Dr Matt Palmer, a Bri­tish Met Of­fice sea level rise sci­en­tist who did not take part in the re­search.</p>
    <p>The 2015 Paris Cli­mate Agree­ment en­joins na­tions to cap global warm­ing at “well be­low” 2 deg C, and 1.5 deg C if pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Even 2 deg C “rep­re­sents an ex­is­ten­tial threat to en­tire na­tion states”, glaciol­ogy pro­fes­sor Jonathan Bam­ber of the University of Bris­tol told the Sci­ence Me­dia Cen­tre, com­ment­ing on the study.</p>
    <p>“We’re look­ing at re­mov­ing na­tions from the map – it doesn’t get much more se­ri­ous than that.”</p>
