    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den will name his first Cabi­net picks to­day, and he is ex­pected to name vet­eran diplo­mat Antony Blinken (be­low) as the sec­re­tary of state. The other ap­pointees may in­clude Mr Jake Sul­li­van as na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser and Ms Linda Thomas-Green­field as am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran diplo­mat Antony Blinken, 58, is ex­pected to be named the United States’ next Sec­re­tary of State.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial an­nounce­ment by Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is an­tic­i­pated to­day in the US, when he is ex­pected to name other ap­pointees too. These may in­clude Mr Jake Sul­li­van, 43, as Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser; and Ms Linda Thomas-Green­field, 68, as am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Sul­li­van, with de­grees from Yale Law School and Ox­ford Univer­sity, was in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion as na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser to Mr Bi­den. Pre­vi­ously among other roles, he was deputy chief of staff to Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton when she was sec­re­tary of state, and se­nior pol­icy ad­viser and chief coun­sel to Sen­a­tor Amy Klobuchar in his home state, Min­nesota.</p>
    <p>Ms Thomas-Green­field, an Africa spe­cial­ist, is a for­mer as­sis­tant sec­re­tary for the Bureau of African Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>The choices, widely ex­pected, sig­nal a re­turn to pro­fes­sion­al­ism and ex­pe­ri­ence, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken is po­si­tioned to be a strong Sec­re­tary of State, tweeted Mr Richard Haass, pres­i­dent of the Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>He would have “a re­la­tion­ship with his boss that al­lows him to speak truth to power and the author­ity to speak for his boss. And he brings knowl­edge of the is­sues and State Depart­ment to the job.”</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken, who grew up in New York and Paris – he speaks French, played the gui­tar and once recorded two songs – is known for his be­lief in the US’ al­liances, which are seen as Washington’s unique ad­van­tage, first against the old Soviet Union and now against a more ag­gres­sive China.</p>
    <p>Once for­mer pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton’s chief for­eign pol­icy speech writer, Mr Blinken went on to be deputy na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser and deputy sec­re­tary of state in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>He joined Mr Bi­den’s staff when the lat­ter was vice-pres­i­dent, but his as­so­ci­a­tion with the Pres­i­dent-elect stretches fur­ther back.</p>
    <p>He was staff di­rec­tor for then Sen­a­tor Bi­den when he was chair­man of the Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>He is seen to be a cen­trist but has also sup­ported in­ter­ven­tion – for ex­am­ple in Libya and Syria. How­ever, he also helped en­gi­neer the US exit from Iraq.</p>
    <p>“We would not have got out of Iraq in a way that left the gov­ern­ment with a fight­ing chance to make it with­out Tony Blinken’s hard work,” Mr Bi­den told The Washington Post in 2013. “He was the go-to guy. He still is the go-to guy.”</p>
    <p>When out of gov­ern­ment, Mr Blinken co-founded po­lit­i­cal strat­egy firm Wes­tExec Ad­vis­ers, along with Ms Michele Flournoy, an­other Obama-era fig­ure who is be­lieved to be in con­tention for De­fence Sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>At an Ax­ios dig­i­tal event last month, Mr Blinken said: “I think you’d see the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion act­ing on the one hand with some hu­mil­ity, be­cause most of the world’s prob­lems are not about us, even though they af­fect us.</p>
    <p>“We can’t just flip a switch and solve them. But also, with con­fi­dence, be­cause Amer­ica, at its best, still has a greater ca­pac­ity than any coun­try on earth to mo­bilise oth­ers in pos­i­tive, col­lec­tive ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would ac­tu­ally re­assert Amer­i­can lead­er­ship, lead­ing with our diplo­macy,”</p>
    <p>A for­mer State Depart­ment of­fi­cial who worked with Mr Blinken, speak­ing to The Straits Times on con­di­tion of anonymity, said: “He is a stead­fast cham­pion of a lib­eral in­ter­na­tional or­der, very fo­cused on the power of in­sti­tu­tions, rules and al­liances.</p>
    <p>“He is also some­one who un­der­stands the State Depart­ment and the role of career diplo­mats and civil ser­vants. He was adept at lead­ing, at set­ting an agenda, at har­ness­ing the power of bu­reau­crats.”</p>
    <p>This world view syncs well with that of Mr Sul­li­van, which sig­nals a co­he­sive for­eign pol­icy team.</p>
    <p>In a lengthy ar­ti­cle for The Atlantic in Jan­uary last year, Mr Sul­li­van wrote that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had “sur­faced ques­tions that need clear an­swers”.</p>
    <p>“Those of us who be­lieve that the United States can and should con­tinue to oc­cupy a global lead­er­ship role, even if a dif­fer­ent role than in the past, have to ex­plain why Trump is wrong – and pro­vide a bet­ter strat­egy for the fu­ture,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“An en­er­gised, in­spir­ing, and ul­ti­mately suc­cess­ful for­eign pol­icy must cut through Trump’s false, dog-whistling choice be­tween glob­al­ism and na­tion­al­ism. It must com­bine the best kind of pa­tri­o­tism… and the best kind of in­ter­na­tion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>“And it should re­ject the worst kind of na­tion­al­ism (damn-the­con­se­quences ag­gres­sion and iden­tity-based hate-mon­ger­ing) and the worst kind of in­ter­na­tion­al­ism (the self-con­grat­u­la­tory in­su­la­tion of the Davos elite).”</p>
    <p>Mr Sul­li­van ended his piece with a rec­ol­lec­tion of a meet­ing with the late Sin­ga­pore found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew, when the lat­ter ap­par­ently told him and then Vice-Pres­i­dent Bi­den how much he ad­mired Amer­ica’s buried “black box” that con­tained the se­cret of Amer­ica’s abil­ity to con­stantly rein­vent it­self.</p>
    <p>“We need to find and un­lock that black box,” Mr Sul­li­van wrote.</p>
