    <p>Sin­ga­porean stu­dents over­seas are fac­ing a muted fes­tive sea­son as Covid-19 cases spike yet again in the United States and the United King­dom. In­stead of the usual ri­otous af­fair with fam­ily and friends, some stu­dents de­cided to make this year’s Thanks­giv­ing cel­e­bra­tion last Thurs­day a quiet one.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean stu­dents over­seas are fac­ing a muted fes­tive sea­son as Covid-19 cases spike yet again in the United States and the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>In­stead of the usual ri­otous af­fair with fam­ily and friends, this year’s Thanks­giv­ing cel­e­bra­tion last Thurs­day has been a quiet one for some stu­dents like Ms Sofia Amanda Ben­ing, 22. Con­cerned about the af­ter-ef­fects of mass travel dur­ing the sea­son, the thirdyear stu­dent at North­west­ern Univer­sity in Illi­nois told The Straits Times: “I am go­ing to leave my build­ing as lit­tle as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>In the past, even those with­out fam­ily in the US could gather for “Friends­giv­ing”. But Mr Jerry Lai, 22, who is in his third year at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley, had dif­fer­ent plans.</p>
    <p>“Some of my friends will en­gage in risky be­hav­iour like go­ing to par­ties or meet­ing peo­ple from out of state,” Mr Lai said. “How­ever, I will meet most of my friends over Zoom, and only a very small cir­cle of trusted friends in real life.”</p>
    <p>Since the start of the se­mes­ter, most uni­ver­si­ties in the US have tran­si­tioned to on­line learn­ing or a hy­brid for­mat.</p>
    <p>The pre­cau­tions taken by Ms Ben­ing and Mr Lai are on top of mea­sures put in place by many schools to en­sure the safety of their stu­dents. For in­stance, the Man­hat­tan School of Mu­sic stip­u­lates that all stu­dents have to be masked even while singing.</p>
    <p>Ms Evan­ge­line Ng, 21, who is in her fourth year there, said: “We also have to switch rooms ev­ery 30 min­utes for them to clean the room with an air fil­tra­tion ma­chine.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, stu­dents at New York Univer­sity (NYU) have to be tested ev­ery other week to re­tain ac­cess to cam­pus fa­cil­i­ties, re­gard­less of whether they live on or off cam­pus.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t do the test, they will in­val­i­date your card and you can’t tap into the build­ings,” said Ms Dilys Tan Chiat, 22. The fourthyear NYU stu­dent called it “one of the most rig­or­ous test­ing pro­grammes I know”.</p>
    <p>De­spite th­ese mea­sures, wor­ries re­main. Many stu­dents point out a dis­tinct lack of en­force­ment or reg­u­la­tion, at least when com­pared with Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“You have to self-re­port (a pos­i­tive test). The school doesn’t get the re­sults back from the lab; you do,” said Ms Tan. “I feel like it is highly de­pen­dent on in­di­vid­u­als and their in­tegrity, whether they will tell the truth and ad­here to the guide­lines given.”</p>
    <p>At present, stu­dents are car­ry­ing on with classes, but ad­justed tim­ings and tech­ni­cal is­sues have made the ex­pe­ri­ence un­com­fort­able at best. Still, re­turn­ing home is not an op­tion, with many cit­ing the risk of in­fec­tion on the long flights back as a de­ter­rence.</p>
    <p>The prospect of four weeks of iso­la­tion or quar­an­tine for a round trip has also made re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore for the school break im­prac­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>This is a con­cern for Ms Sta­cia See­toh, 20, a se­cond-year in­dus­trial de­sign stu­dent at the Rhode Is­land School of De­sign. She had re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in March dur­ing the pan­demic, but it soon be­came clear to her that “I could not do school at home”.</p>
    <p>She said: “It was not a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment. We had to make do with what­ever we had for a lot of our fi­nal projects for spring.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing re­solved to stay on abroad, stu­dents now have no choice but to hun­ker down as a new wave of in­fec­tions is ex­pected af­ter the Thanks­giv­ing break.</p>
    <p>Many schools have al­ready started to pre­pare for the i nevitable by hold­ing all classes on­line af­ter Thanks­giv­ing for the rest of the term.</p>
    <p>Over in Britain, stu­dents are fac­ing a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion with the up­com­ing Christ­mas break. De­spite a se­cond na­tional lock­down in the coun­try, at­ti­tudes re­main lax.</p>
    <p>“Most peo­ple don’t wear masks in pub­lic,” said Ms Jessie Chua, 22, a fourth-year stu­dent at a mu­sic con­ser­va­tory in Lon­don which she de­clined to name.</p>
    <p>Ms Ni­cole Yap, 22, who is in her fourth year at the Univer­sity of Ed­in­burgh, elab­o­rated: “A va­ri­ety of peo­ple wear masks in dif­fer­ent ways, but not all of them are ef­fec­tive.” Med­i­cal ser­vices are also scarce. Said Mr Wilkie Lee, 25, who is in his se­cond year at the Univer­sity of Bris­tol: “If you get Covid-19, you will be asked to self-iso­late.</p>
    <p>“Med­i­cal at­ten­tion will come only if you are in a dire state.”</p>
    <p>For now, many cling to the news that a vac­cine may be re­leased early next year.</p>
    <p>“It feels naive,” said Ms Tan. “But there is still a part of me that hopes it might hap­pen.”</p>
