    <p>Re­tail con­tin­ued its re­bound in Au­gust – the sec­ond full month of re­open­ing af­ter the cir­cuit breaker – al­though the sharp jump in sales seen in July has pe­tered out.</p>
    <p>Tak­ings at the till de­clined 5.7 per cent com­pared with Au­gust last year but bet­ter than the year-on-year drop of 8.5 per cent in July, the Statis­tics De­part­ment noted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles, re­tail sales fell 8.4 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, on a month-on-month sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, the in­crease in re­tail sales ta­pered off, ris­ing only 1.4 per cent from July to Au­gust, com­pared with the 27.2 per cent surge from June to July.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling said dis­cre­tionary spend­ing re­mained soft com­pared with prepan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>She noted that while more peo­ple are din­ing out, the tak­ings at food and bev­er­age ser­vices still dropped year on year, un­der­lin­ing the on­go­ing chal­lenges fac­ing the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>United Overseas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan also noted that growth rates have ta­pered sharply from the lev­els seen in June and July: “This could sug­gest that the ini­tial do­mes­tic pent-up de­mand for a broad (part) of Sin­ga­pore’s re­tail sales seg­ment has grad­u­ally dis­si­pated since phase two started on June 19.”</p>
    <p>Most re­tail sec­tors still reg­is­tered year-on-year de­clines in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Food and al­co­hol fell the most, down 42.6 per cent, fol­lowed by de­part­ment stores, where tak­ings dropped 35.3 per cent. Sales of cos­met­ics, toi­letries and med­i­cal goods, and wear­ing ap­parel and footwear, were also took a big hit.</p>
    <p>But su­per­mar­kets and hy­per­mar­kets con­tin­ued to see sales ris­ing, with growth of 21.9 per cent. Stores sell­ing fur­ni­ture and house­hold equip­ment, and com­put­ers and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions items also had a boost on the back of higher de­mand as peo­ple work from home.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor ve­hi­cle sales rose by 12.1 per cent but rev­enue from food and</p>
    <p>bev­er­age ser­vices fell 28.6 per cent from Au­gust last year – higher than the 25.4 per cent de­cline in July.</p>
    <p>This was mainly at­trib­uted to food cater­ers, who saw sales plunge 70.6 per cent as cater­ing ser­vices for most for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries were no longer re­quired from Au­gust, Sing­stat said.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants, cafes, food courts and other eat­ing places and fast­food out­lets also saw tak­ings drop.</p>
    <p>The to­tal sales value of food and bev­er­age ser­vices in Au­gust was es­ti­mated at $665 mil­lion, with on­line turnover ac­count­ing for an es­ti­mated 20.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>On­line re­tail sales made up an es­ti­mated 10.9 per cent of the es­ti­mated to­tal turnover of $3.4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales are un­likely to cross into pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory this year, Ms Ling said, pre­dict­ing a drop of 14 per cent for the 12 months. She added: “This would mark the third year of con­trac­tion for the do­mes­tic re­tail sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“In the in­terim, the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers voucher is un­likely to be a short-term panacea, al­beit the open­ing up of travel bub­bles and more green-lane ar­range­ments to al­low for more overseas vis­i­tors should be wel­come re­lief over the medium term.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will get these tourism vouch­ers to help busi­nesses bat­tered by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said: “Bar­ring a rein­tro­duc­tion of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, the re­turn of do­mes­tic con­sumer de­mand should also cush­ion the rate of con­trac­tion on a year-on-year per­spec­tive for the rest of 2020.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, over­all re­tail sales may still be un­able to sur­pass 2019 lev­els, given the sharp de­clines al­ready seen in the first half of 2020 amid the lack of tourism-re­lated de­mand.”</p>
