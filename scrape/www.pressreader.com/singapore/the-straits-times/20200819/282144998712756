    <p>The cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) for mo­tor­cy­cles rock­eted to $7,702 after the re­cent circuit breaker (COE prices rise across the board as bid­ding re­sumes, July 9).</p>
    <p>While one might dis­miss it as pent-up demand, this no­tion was dis­pelled when the sec­ond round of bid­ding saw the price of $6,510. The lat­est re­sult is $7,701.</p>
    <p>The COE bid­ding sys­tem has a de­posit that can be for­feited to de­ter friv­o­lous bids and ma­nip­u­la­tion of the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Once a bid is suc­cess­ful, the suc­cess­ful bid­der will be is­sued a tem­po­rary COE that is valid for ei­ther three or six months. For all ve­hi­cles, the de­posit is $10,000, but for mo­tor­cy­cles, it is $200.</p>
    <p>This means that while car deal­ers will be de­terred by the loss of $10,000 for each un­used COE, for mo­tor­cy­cle deal­ers, the po­ten­tial loss of $200 per COE is not a suf­fi­cient de­ter­rent to dis­cour­age the hoard­ing of COEs.</p>
    <p>Deal­ers that can af­ford the bids will place high bids to se­cure COEs, against the loss of $200 per COE.</p>
    <p>Many deal­ers also earn through ve­hi­cle fi­nanc­ing and the in­ter­est earned on it. A high COE will mean that the prin­ci­pal amount on which in­ter­est is cal­cu­lated is higher (since it is ba­si­cally ve­hi­cle price + COE).</p>
    <p>So deal­ers do not have any in­cen­tive to lower COE prices since they al­low them to earn more through in­ter­est and also be­cause the COE cost is ul­ti­mately borne by the buyer.</p>
    <p>I am sur­prised that this prob­lem has been around for a long time and re­mains to this day (LTA meets four deal­ers over mo­tor­cy­cle COE price spikes, April 10, 2017).</p>
    <p>A more eq­ui­table sys­tem is to set the de­posit at a per­cent­age of the bid. This would dis­cour­age hoard­ing, es­pe­cially in these try­ing times.</p>
