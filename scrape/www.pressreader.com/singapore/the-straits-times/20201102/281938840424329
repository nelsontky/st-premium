    <p>BRIS­BANE • Aus­tralia’s Queens­land state has voted to keep its cen­tre-left gov­ern­ment af­ter a race dom­i­nated by de­bate over strict mea­sures to pre­vent the coron­avirus from spread­ing in the pop­u­lar tourist play­ground.</p>
    <p>Queens­land, home to the Great Bar­rier Reef and known as the Sun­shine State for its invit­ing weather, be­came a na­tional bat­tle­ground over virus pre­ven­tion af­ter its de­ci­sion to shut its bor­ders to other states to keep out Covid-19.</p>
    <p>State Premier An­nasta­cia Palaszczuk – who has been heav­ily crit­i­cised by Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son and his con­ser­va­tive gov­ern­ment over the im­pact of bor­der clo­sures on Queens­land’s large tourism in­dus­try – claimed vic­tory late last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“Here in Queens­land we’ve all stood strong and united,” Ms Palaszczuk said in her vic­tory speech. “We stared down crit­ics and we have come out of it all the bet­ter for it.”</p>
    <p>The first ma­jor state elec­tion amid Covid-19 has been seen as a barom­e­ter on pref­er­ences on how to han­dle the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The win will write Ms Palaszczuk into the his­tory books as the first woman to win three elec­tions in Aus­tralia, and by mid-2021 she will be­come the long­est-serv­ing fe­male leader in the coun­try’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>Ms Palaszczuk’s gov­ern­ment held a slim one-seat ma­jor­ity in the 93-mem­ber Par­lia­ment head­ing into the elec­tion. With just over 60 per cent of the vote counted, public broad­caster ABC pre­dicted her La­bor Party could pick up an ad­di­tional four seats af­ter a 5 per cent swing in its favour.</p>
    <p>Queens­land, with a pop­u­la­tion of around five mil­lion, has recorded just un­der 1,200 to­tal coron­avirus cases this year and six re­lated deaths.</p>
