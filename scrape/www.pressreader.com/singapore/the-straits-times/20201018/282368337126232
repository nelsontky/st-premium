    <p>Land­lub­bers, ahoy! Up north, Coney Is­land Park beck­ons – and you don’t even have to sail to get there.</p>
    <p>Coney Is­land got its name af­ter it was sold to an In­dian busi­ness­man who wanted to turn the is­land into a re­sort, nam­ing it af­ter the New York amuse­ment park. But he was later fined for cor­rup­tion and his plans never ma­te­ri­alised.</p>
    <p>The park, which changed hands sev­eral times in the last cen­tury, re­opened in 2015, and is now joined to the main­land by bridges at Pung­gol Prom­e­nade and Pasir Ris Coast In­dus­trial Park 6.</p>
    <p>When I ar­rive at the east en­trance at 8.30am – af­ter a brisk cy­cle from my home in Pasir Ris – I am sur­prised by how many other peo­ple are al­ready there – droves of cy­clists, jog­gers and other vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Early-bird Ra­jeev Kaushik, 50, an avid pho­tog­ra­pher, has been out – near the Seran­goon Reser­voir – since 6.30am.</p>
    <p>“Most peo­ple, when they are walk­ing around, don’t re­alise that there are so many birds, but there are,” says the Pung­gol res­i­dent, show­ing me his pho­tos of ea­gles and herons, while a mon­i­tor lizard swims lan­guidly in the water be­hind him.</p>
    <p>In the park, I spot more crea­tures – a change­able lizard, king crow but­ter­flies, a fam­ily of long-tailed macaques and what might have been a dwarf reed snake.</p>
    <p>I’m struck by the wide va­ri­ety of flora – from ca­sua­r­ina wood­lands to man­groves, and coastal trees to cy­cads (which can live for as long as 1,000 years).</p>
    <p>Coney Is­land has plenty of charm, even though two of its old at­trac­tions can­not be seen any­more.</p>
    <p>One is an elu­sive Brah­man bull that roamed the is­land but died a few years ago in the mid­dle of a health check-up.</p>
    <p>The other is the old Haw Par Beach Villa built by the Tiger Balm broth­ers who owned the is­land from the 1930s to 1950s. The build­ing, which is derelict and struc­turally un­sound, is closed off and nigh im­pos­si­ble to find.</p>
