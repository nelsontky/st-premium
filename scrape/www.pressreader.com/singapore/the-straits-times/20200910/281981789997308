    <p>Bri­tain plunged Brexit trade talks into cri­sis yes­ter­day by pub­lish­ing a Bill that ex­plic­itly ac­knowl­edges the gov­ern­ment could break in­ter­na­tional law by ig­nor­ing some parts of the di­vorce treaty it signed with the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Brush­ing aside warn­ings from Brussels that breach­ing the treaty would pre­vent any trade deal from be­ing struck, Lon­don said in the pro­posed leg­is­la­tion that it would ig­nore parts of the With­drawal Agree­ment, which was signed in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The Internal Mar­kets Bill says that cer­tain pro­vi­sions are “to have ef­fect notwith­stand­ing in­con­sis­tency or in­com­pat­i­bil­ity with in­ter­na­tional or other do­mes­tic law”.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has said in­ter­na­tional law would be bro­ken “in a very spe­cific and lim­ited way”, but the EU has made its anger plain.</p>
    <p>“Very con­cerned about an­nounce­ments from the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment on its in­ten­tions to breach the With­drawal Agree­ment,” Ms Ur­sula von der Leyen, pres­i­dent of the</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the EU ex­ec­u­tive branch, said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“This would break in­ter­na­tional law and un­der­mines trust. Pacta sunt ser­vanda = the foun­da­tion of pros­per­ous fu­ture re­la­tions,” she said. The Latin phrase, mean­ing “agree­ments must be kept”, is a ba­sic prin­ci­ple of in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son told Par­lia­ment the Bill was “a le­gal safety net to pro­tect our coun­try against ex­treme or ir­ra­tional in­ter­pre­ta­tions” of the North­ern Ire­land pro­to­col of the With­drawal Agree­ment that could threaten peace in the Bri­tish prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The Bill, if ap­proved, would give min­is­ters the power to ig­nore parts of the pro­to­col by mod­i­fy­ing the form of ex­port dec­la­ra­tions and other exit pro­ce­dures. It will be de­bated in both cham­bers of Par­lia­ment and re­quire their ap­proval be­fore be­com­ing law.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain quit the EU in Jan­uary but has re­mained part of its sin­gle mar­ket, largely free of trade bar­ri­ers, un­der a sta­tus quo agree­ment that ex­pires in De­cem­ber. It has been ne­go­ti­at­ing a trade deal to take ef­fect on Jan 1, but says it is will­ing to walk away if it can­not agree on favourable terms.</p>
    <p>Ir­ish Prime Min­is­ter Micheal Martin said he would speak to Mr John­son to ex­press “very strong con­cerns” about the plans while his deputy Leo Varad­kar called it a “kamikaze” threat that had back­fired.</p>
    <p>Asked how he could ex­pect Bri­tons to obey the law if his gov­ern­ment was will­ing to un­der­mine it, Mr John­son said: “We ex­pect ev­ery­body in this coun­try to obey the law.”</p>
    <p>Scot­land and Wales said the Bill would weaken the fab­ric of the United King­dom it­self by steal­ing pow­ers from Wales, Scot­land and North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>“The Prime Min­is­ter and his friends... are cre­at­ing a rogue state, one where the rule of law does not ap­ply,” said Mr Ian Black­ford, leader of the pro-in­de­pen­dence Scot­tish Na­tional Party.</p>
