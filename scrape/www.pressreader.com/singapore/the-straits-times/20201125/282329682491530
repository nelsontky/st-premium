    <p>De­spite the pan­demic, about one in two re­tail­ers in Sin­ga­pore still ex­pe­ri­enced higher sales from Septem­ber to Oc­to­ber this year than last year, but bank­ing on lo­cal de­mand may not be sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>That is ac­cord­ing to an Amer­i­can Ex­press sur­vey re­leased on Mon­day that sur­veyed 300 small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in Sin­ga­pore with an­nual rev­enues of $100 mil­lion or less.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, 32 per cent of re­tail­ers sur­veyed said they ex­pe­ri­enced a 50 per cent year-on-year in­crease in sales over that pe­riod. Another 17 per cent of those sur­veyed saw sales in­crease more than 50 per cent on the year.</p>
    <p>These signs may bode well for re­tail­ers ahead of the year-end hol­i­day sea­son. Ear­lier this month, a Visa study of some 250 small and medium re­tail­ers i n Sin­ga­pore showed that 68 per cent of them thought of the hol­i­day sea­son as a “ma­jor sales op­por­tu­nity”.</p>
    <p>Visa also sur­veyed 500 con­sumers i n Sin­ga­pore, of whom about four in five still plan to do hol­i­day shop­ping.</p>
    <p>Yet, an Amer­i­can Ex­press spokesman noted that al­though some busi­nesses ex­pe­ri­enced higher sales in Septem­ber and last month and may be an­tic­i­pat­ing strong year-end sales, “it’s a ques­tion of sus­tain­abil­ity”.</p>
    <p>This is also as most re­tail­ers in Sin­ga­pore still de­pend on de­mand from tourists. About nine in 10 of the busi­nesses polled by Amer­i­can Ex­press said they would see a “mod­er­ate” to “sig­nif­i­cant” im­pact if in­bound trav­ellers do not re­turn by the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>“Our in­sights tell us that there is cur­rently pent-up de­mand from lo­cal cus­tomers due to the lack of travel, but it re­mains to be seen if this can out­weigh the in­come from tourism,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>To give lo­cal spend­ing a boost, Amer­i­can Ex­press is launch­ing a cashback of­fer, called Shop Small, to en­cour­age its card mem­bers to spend at about 2,000 busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For the whole of next month, card mem­bers will en­joy $5 in cashback when they spend at least $10 at par­tic­i­pat­ing busi­nesses, up to three times.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers par­tic­i­pat­ing i n the cam­paign can be found at 11 Cap­i­taLand malls and se­lected precincts such as Kam­pong Glam, Telok Ayer and Tiong Bahru.</p>
    <p>One of them is Aspial, which owns home-grown brands such as Lee Hwa Jew­ellery and Gold­heart.</p>
    <p>Mr Kean Ng, Aspial’s se­nior direc­tor, said: “Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, we are see­ing more en­thu­si­as­tic shop­pers vis­it­ing our stores com­pared with pre-Covid-19 times. We are heart­ened by their sup­port and hope Shop Small will help en­cour­age more res­i­dents to sup­port lo­cal busi­nesses like ours.”</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Visa’s Where You Shop Mat­ters is a cam­paign aimed at en­cour­ag­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to shop lo­cal. The aim is to help Covid-hit re­tail­ers bounce back and also go dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>To that end, Visa has cre­ated an e-com­merce starter kit for SMEs to kick-start their dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion jour­ney, as well as joined hands with Shopee to pro­mote l ocal mer­chants.</p>
    <p>Mr Ku­nal Chat­ter­jee, Visa’s coun­try man­ager for Sin­ga­pore and Brunei, said: “We recog­nised that lo­cal con­sumers have the power to pos­i­tively im­pact their com­mu­nity through the value of their dol­lar and wanted to use our net­work to raise aware­ness on this is­sue to sup­port the lo­cal busi­ness re­cov­ery.”</p>
