    <p>SEOUL • South Korea said yes­ter­day that it had alerted about 1,000 peo­ple who at­tended the memo­rial of Sam­sung Group pa­tri­arch Lee Kun-hee l ast week to get tested for Covid-19 af­ter one per­son at the event tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>A lo­cal jour­nal­ist who had cov­ered the memo­rial de­vel­oped symp­toms two days later and tested pos­i­tive on Mon­day, the health au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>At l east six new coro­n­avirus cases – in­clud­ing two col­leagues and two fam­ily mem­bers – had been linked to the jour­nal­ist, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency of­fi­cial Kwak Jin told a brief­ing that no cases had yet been di­rectly linked to the fu­neral home at the Sam­sung Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Seoul – in­clud­ing that of the jour­nal­ist, who wore a mask dur­ing the event.</p>
    <p>Among those were at­tended the memo­rial were many high-pro­file busi­ness lead­ers, politi­cians and se­nior pres­i­den­tial aides.</p>
    <p>Some of the vis­i­tors who had al­ready tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus af­ter the memo­rial in­cluded Deputy Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Kim Hyun-chong and Jeju Gov­er­nor Won Hee-ry­ong, ac­cord­ing to the pres­i­den­tial Blue House and Jeju city.</p>
    <p>South Korea has used ag­gres­sive testing and con­tact trac­ing in a bid to con­tain the virus and was lauded as a suc­cess story at the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, but has been fight­ing daily cases that have hov­ered around 100 over the past week.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple at­tended the memo­rial over four days to pay their re­spects in an area capped at 50 peo­ple, while vis­i­tors also wore masks as re­quired in pub­lic places to con­trol the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 125 new coro­n­avirus cases as of Wed­nes­day mid­night, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions to 27,050, and the Covid-19 death toll to 475.</p>
