    <p>Sin­ga­pore has made it clear that hir­ing prac­tices that dis­crim­i­nate against Sin­ga­pore­ans are un­ac­cept­able. It should be made clear, too, that our con­tention is not about for­eign work­ers</p>
    <p>(S’pore to stay open to top global tal­ent as it trans­forms econ­omy, Sept 9).</p>
    <p>Even when a large pro­por­tion of those re­trenched were for­eign work­ers, in view of the na­tion’s predicamen­t, it was a ne­ces­sity, not a choice.</p>
    <p>With ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment ex­ac­er­bat­ing the an­guish of the job­less, Sin­ga­pore­ans have to re­main re­silient. Per­haps the story of the Great Wall of Ja­pan could serve us well as an anal­ogy amid tur­bu­lent times.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the 2011 tsunami, the Ja­panese au­thor­i­ties em­barked on build­ing a 15m-high anti-tsunami wall across 400km to di­vide the land from the ocean. In spite of their grief, hav­ing lost fam­ily mem­bers to the tsunami, fish­er­men in Aka­hama in Ot­suchi town fought against the con­struc­tion of the bar­rier.</p>
    <p>To these fish­er­men, their close re­la­tion­ship with the sea is pri­mal. They ac­cepted that a tsunami is a natural oc­cur­rence – they can­not hate the ocean that sus­tains lives. They chose to move their houses to higher ground in­stead.</p>
    <p>Akin to the fish­er­men’s deep con­nec­tion with the sea, our re­la­tion­ship with mi­grant work­ers is rooted and en­dur­ing. The ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans to­day are de­scen­dants of im­mi­grants, whose fore­fa­thers came to Sin­ga­pore as mi­grant work­ers and be­came cit­i­zens. To­day, mi­grant work­ers con­tinue to con­trib­ute to our na­tion build­ing.</p>
    <p>To the fish­er­men in Aka­hama, de­stroy­ing the en­vi­ron­ment in or­der to safe­guard a com­mu­nity from the forces of na­ture is some­thing that is wrong.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, to re­sist the na­ture of global com­pe­ti­tion that re­quires Sin­ga­pore to open its labour mar­ket is not the right thing to do. Be­sides, we too can choose to move to higher ground by im­prov­ing our odds in com­pet­ing with for­eign­ers for jobs.</p>
    <p>Such is the poignant re­silience of the fish­er­men in Aka­hama.</p>
