    <p>With the pan­demic keep­ing au­di­ences at home, Net­flix view­ing across all gen­res of films and tele­vi­sion went up in Sin­ga­pore by as much as 200 per cent com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>The stream­ing gi­ant re­vealed yes­ter­day the top most-watched ti­tle in each genre this year.</p>
    <p>South Korean con­tent per­formed strongly, with K-drama view­er­ship surg­ing by al­most 200 per cent.</p>
    <p>The top K-drama ti­tle was the Lee Min-ho and Kim Go-eun ve­hi­cle The King: Eter­nal Monarch; and the most en­dur­ing one was Kim Soo-hyun and Seo Ye-ji’s ro­mance drama It’s Okay To Not Be Okay, which stayed in the top 10 list in Sin­ga­pore for 103 days.</p>
    <p>While Net­flix an­nounced the top per­form­ing ti­tle in dif­fer­ent gen­res, it pro­vided nei­ther view­ing num­bers nor an over­all top 10 list.</p>
    <p>In the hor­ror genre, the K-zom­bie flick #Alive, led by Yoo Ah-in, took the top spot, knock­ing out other hot ti­tles such as the 2005 lo­cal movie The Maid and this year’s Net­flix orig­i­nal se­ries The Haunt­ing Of Bly Manor.</p>
    <p>Thrilling true-crime tales and the so­cial-me­dia doc­u­men­tary The So­cial Dilemma were no match for K-pop girl group Black­pink, whose doc­u­men­tary Black­pink: Light Up The Sky topped the doc­u­men­tary cat­e­gory this year.</p>
    <p>Films also did well with lo­cal view­ers, with Enola Holmes – the young adult tale of Sher­lock Holmes’ younger sis­ter – com­ing in at No. 1 in the drama genre.</p>
    <p>It was up against strong com­peti­tors such as the re­cent chess drama The Queen’s Gam­bit and the ur­ban fan­tasy Lu­cifer, now in its fifth sea­son.</p>
    <p>The ten­sion-filled in­fi­delity K-drama The World Of The Mar­ried also per­formed well in the drama cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Drama view­ing was up by nearly 70 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>The 2018 Sin­ga­pore-set Hol­ly­wood ro­man­tic com­edy Crazy Rich Asians was the most pop­u­lar ro­mance film on the ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Stay­ing home seemed to make au­di­ences yearn for pas­sion­ate love af­fairs as view­er­ship of ro­mance ti­tles in­creased by more than 200 per cent.</p>
    <p>De­spite brick­bats for its su­per­fi­cial­ity and un­re­al­is­tic story lines, the se­ries Emily In Paris – about a young Amer­i­can woman who moves to Paris for work – was No. 1 in the com­edy genre. The show has since been re­newed for a sec­ond sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ex­trac­tion – the Chris Hemsworth movie about a mer­ce­nary who has to res­cue a drug lord’s kid­napped son – was most­watched in the ac­tion genre.</p>
    <p>In other as­sorted gen­res, the Span­ish se­ries Money Heist: Part 4 was Sin­ga­pore’s favourite thriller; fam­i­lies en­joyed the an­i­mated kids film The An­gry Birds Movie 2 (2019); and an­ime fans caught their fill of Poke­mon: Mewtwo Strikes Back – Evo­lu­tion (2019).</p>
