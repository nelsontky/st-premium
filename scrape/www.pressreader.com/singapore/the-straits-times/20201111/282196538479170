    <p>BEI­JING • China Mer­chants Bank and other state-backed lenders have emerged as the big­gest win­ners from new reg­u­la­tions that de­railed Ant Group’s mas­sive stock list­ing, as Bei­jing aims to level the play­ing field be­tween fin­tech giants and tra­di­tional banks.</p>
    <p>China Mer­chants Bank, known as the coun­try’s re­tail bank king, soared 16 per cent in Hong Kong this month, its big­gest six-day ad­vance in more than five years.</p>
    <p>Other Chi­nese lenders also gained, in­clud­ing Agri­cul­tural Bank of China, while Alibaba Group Hold­ing, a one-third share­holder of Ant, lost 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese banks, trad­ing near record low val­u­a­tions, ral­lied af­ter fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tors last week pro­posed new rules to curb the rapid growth and lever­age at the na­tion’s more than 200 mi­croloan lenders, putting a sur­prise halt to Ant’s US$37 bil­lion (S$50 bil­lion) ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO).</p>
    <p>Ant and other fin­tech giants, such as Ten­cent Hold­ings, us­ing big data and cloud com­put­ing, have grabbed mar­ket share from banks in the lu­cra­tive con­sumer lend­ing space by pro­vid­ing eas­ier ac­cess to credit for younger users on­line, many of whom have lit­tle in­come or credit his­tory.</p>
    <p>“The reg­u­la­tions move the dial back in favour of banks,” said Mr San­jay Jain, Sin­ga­pore-based head of fi­nan­cials at Aletheia Cap­i­tal, Asia’s big­gest in­de­pen­dent in­vest­ment re­search firm.</p>
    <p>“It seems the reg­u­la­tors are putting brakes on the ex­tent of in­come that can be dis­in­ter­me­di­ated out of the bank­ing sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>China Mer­chants Bank, based in Shen­zhen, is one of the largest credit card is­suers in the na­tion with 155 mil­lion con­sumer bank­ing clients at the end of Septem­ber. It de­rived about 57 per cent of its net op­er­at­ing in­come from re­tail fi­nance last year, among the high­est in China.</p>
    <p>Along with other state-owned lenders such as the In­dus­trial & Com­mer­cial Bank of China, it has been bat­tling Ant for cus­tomers in ev­ery­thing from pay­ments to lend­ing and wealth man­age­ment, while lever­ag­ing its own dig­i­tal plat­forms to ac­quire new users.</p>
    <p>Ant has been win­ning a lot of the bat­tles. Mr Jack Ma’s fin­tech jug­ger</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tions move the dial back in favour of banks. It seems the reg­u­la­tors are putting brakes on the ex­tent of in­come that can be dis­in­ter­me­di­ated out of the bank­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>MR SAN­JAY JAIN, Sin­ga­pore-based head of fi­nan­cials at Aletheia Cap­i­tal, on Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors’ move to level the play­ing field be­tween tra­di­tional banks and on­line ri­vals.</p>
    <p>naut helped pro­vide small un­se­cured loans to about 500 mil­lion peo­ple over the past year through two mi­crolend­ing plat­forms: Huabei (Just Spend) and Jiebei (Just Lend). Af­ter get­ting its start in on­line pay­ments with Ali­pay, lend­ing is now the firm’s big­gest busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ant has un­der­writ­ten about 1.7 tril­lion yuan (S$347.7 bil­lion) in con­sumer loans and 422 bil­lion yuan in small busi­ness loans for about 100 banks and other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, most of which have lim­ited dis­tri­bu­tion net­works.</p>
    <p>Ant does not work with larger con­sumer lenders like China Mer­chants Bank.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese state banks have been push­ing for Bei­jing to curb fin­tech giants for years with lim­ited suc­cess. At one point, state me­dia called Ant’s money-mar­ket funds “blood­suck­ing vam­pires” for si­phon­ing off banks’ de­posits. The move last week was a “wa­ter­shed mo­ment” for the fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tory frame­work, ac­cord­ing to Daiwa Se­cu­ri­ties Group.</p>
    <p>The China Se­cu­ri­ties Reg­u­la­tory Com­mis­sion said a shift in the reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment for the fin­tech in­dus­try will have a “huge im­pact” on Ant’s op­er­a­tional struc­ture and profit model.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor said pre­vent­ing Ant’s “hasty” list­ing, two days be­fore the sched­uled de­but in Shang­hai and Hong Kong, is a re­spon­si­ble mea­sure for the mar­ket and in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­posed changes, Ant and other on­line lenders will have to pro­vide at least 30 per cent of the fund­ing when it of­fers loans with other banks, up from just 2 per cent now.</p>
    <p>Loans to an in­di­vid­ual would be capped at 300,000 yuan, or no more than a third of the bor­rower’s av­er­age in­come in the past three years.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tions raise the bar for Ant and other up­start lenders, forc­ing them to set aside more cap­i­tal and as­sume more risks, sim­i­lar to the stan­dards im­posed on play­ers like China Mer­chants Bank.</p>
    <p>“The en­try bar­ri­ers to the on­line mi­crolend­ing busi­ness have in­creased,” said Mr Tang Shengbo, an an­a­lyst at No­mura Se­cu­ri­ties. He ex­pects the in­dus­try’s growth in loan bal­ances to slow to 17 per cent an­nu­ally be­tween last year and 2023, from a pre­vi­ous es­ti­mate of 28 per cent.</p>
    <p>That muted growth should give a boost to China Mer­chants Bank, which cur­rently trades at 10 times earn­ings, more than twice as high as its Hong Kong-listed peers.</p>
    <p>But that is a frac­tion of the 48 times 2021 price-to-earn­ings ra­tio that in­vestors as­signed to Ant ahead of its planned list­ing.</p>
    <p>When the Ant IPO comes back to mar­ket, likely next year, in­vestors will give it a much smaller val­u­a­tion, ac­cord­ing to some an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ples will be closer to tra­di­tional banks’, re­flect­ing the new regime that makes Ant more “fin” than “tech”.</p>
    <p>“At the very least, the fizz and the froth around the IPO and the post-list­ing price should be gone,” said Mr Jain.</p>
    <p>“The au­thor­i­ties would have achieved their ob­jec­tive.”</p>
