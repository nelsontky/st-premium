    <p>An ad­di­tional $187 mil­lion will be pumped into Sin­ga­pore’s hard-hit avi­a­tion sec­tor, as part of ef­forts to ex­tend aid un­der the en­hanced avi­a­tion sup­port pack­age till March next year.</p>
    <p>This will pro­vide cost re­lief for air­lines, ground han­dlers, cargo agents and air­port ten­ants in a sec­tor that has borne the brunt of the Covid-19 pan­demic, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said in a min­is­te­rial state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It will also help lo­cal car­ri­ers re­gain air con­nec­tiv­ity to the world.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Finance Min­is­ter, un­veiled this as part of a strat­egy to fur­ther sup­port the hard­est-hit sec­tors – aero­space, avi­a­tion and tourism.</p>
    <p>The move will help these sec­tors re­tain core ca­pa­bil­i­ties and po­si­tion them for an even­tual re­cov­ery, he said. “These sec­tors are im­por­tant parts of our econ­omy, and they are mul­ti­pli­ers for other sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the Repub­lic’s po­si­tion as a global busi­ness node de­pends on its con­nec­tiv­ity as an air hub, he stressed.</p>
    <p>The Changi air hub and its ad­ja­cent in­dus­tries con­trib­ute to more than 5 per cent of the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and em­ploy over 190,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The ex­tended fi­nan­cial re­lief for air­lines, ground han­dlers, cargo agents and other part­ners at Changi Air­port and Sele­tar Air­port would be pro­vided through land­ing, park­ing and rental re­bates, the Min­istry of Trans­port and the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For air­lines, these in­clude: a 10 per cent land­ing charge re­bate for all sched­uled pas­sen­ger flights land­ing here, a 50 per cent rental re­bate for their lounges and of­fices within Changi Air­port and Sele­tar Air­port ter­mi­nal build­ings, and a full re­bate on air­craft park­ing charges at both air­ports.</p>
    <p>Ground han­dlers will get a 50 per cent rental re­bate for their lounges and of­fices within the two air­ports’ ter­mi­nal build­ings.</p>
    <p>There will also be a 10 per cent land­ing charge re­bate for all sched­uled freighter flights land­ing here, as well as a 20 per cent rental re­bate for cargo agents ten­anted at Changi Air­freight Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion and aero­space sec­tors have been dec­i­mated by the pan­demic, with global air travel crip­pled by bor­der clo­sures and air­lines scrap­ping plane or­ders.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Heng an­nounced that firms in the badly af­fected aero­space, avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors will get 50 per cent of wages paid for seven more months un­til March un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS).</p>
    <p>To help these sec­tors re­cover, the</p>
    <p>Govern­ment will work with firms to sup­port work­ers with spe­cialised skills and of­fer fur­ther help to re­tain their core ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>For work­ers in the avi­a­tion sec­tor who can­not work now, the Govern­ment has been help­ing to re­de­ploy them to other ar­eas where their skills are val­ued.</p>
    <p>So far, 500 air­crew have been re­de­ployed to hos­pi­tals as care am­bas­sadors, tap­ping their ser­vice skills to sup­port non-clin­i­cal work.</p>
    <p>The tem­po­rary re­de­ploy­ment pro­gramme will be scaled up, with some 4,000 new jobs, in­clud­ing per­ma­nent roles, to be cre­ated in the health­care sec­tor alone, said Mr Heng. “And we are also cre­at­ing more jobs in other ar­eas of need.”</p>
    <p>Aero­space and avi­a­tion firms wel­comed the ex­tra sup­port, which they be­lieve would help Sin­ga­pore main­tain its status as an air hub.</p>
    <p>Mr Lien Whai Cheng, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of air­craft main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul firm Coway Engi­neer­ing & Mar­ket­ing, said the ex­tended JSS would give com­pa­nies time to ad­just their op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Over the past few months, his firm has diver­si­fied its busi­ness model to cater to other ar­eas such as semi­con­duc­tors.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines said the sup­port mea­sures of­fer “much-needed re­lief”, adding that it will con­tinue to “pur­sue cost man­age­ment mea­sures and ex­plore ad­di­tional means to shore up our liq­uid­ity dur­ing this time”.</p>
    <p>“The re­cov­ery of air travel and air­freight is a nec­es­sary cat­a­lyst for the re­cov­ery of global trade and economies that have been se­verely im­pacted by the Covid-19 pan­demic,” it said.</p>
