    <p>The elec­tric­ity tar­iff for house­holds will fall by 3.1 per cent for the next three months, com­pared with the quar­ter be­fore, while the gas tar­iff will rise by 0.23 per cent.</p>
    <p>The elec­tric­ity tar­iff will de­crease from 21.43 cents per kilo­watt hour (kwh) to 20.76 cents per kwh from Jan 1 to March 31 next year, ex­clud­ing GST (goods and ser­vices tax). The rate in­clud­ing GST is 22.21 cents per kwh.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the av­er­age monthly elec­tric­ity bill for fam­i­lies liv­ing in four-room Hous­ing Board flats will de­crease by $2.39 be­fore GST, said SP Group.</p>
    <p>The fall is due to lower en­ergy costs, it added.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate state­ment, City Gas announced yes­ter­day that from Jan 1 to March 31, the gas tar­iff be­fore GST will rise by 0.04 cent per kwh, from 17.19 cents per kwh to 17.23 cents per kwh.</p>
    <p>The piped- gas pro­ducer and re­tailer said that this is due to an in­crease in fuel costs com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>On why elec­tric­ity tar­iffs de­creased but gas tar­iffs rose when both are de­pen­dent on fuel, Pro­fes­sor Su­bodh Mhaisalkar, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s En­ergy Re­search In­sti­tute, said there are many sup­ply and de­mand fac­tors to be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>He said: “For gas, these in­clude global pro­duc­tion and stor­age lev­els, as well as long-term sup­ply con­tracts by Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“(Other than fuel costs), elec­tric­ity tar­iffs paid by con­sumers are also af­fected by dif­fer­ences be­tween elec­tric­ity con­sump­tion fore­casts and ac­tual con­sump­tion.”</p>
    <p>Both City Gas and SP Group re­view tar­iffs based on guide­lines set by the En­ergy Mar­ket Author­ity.</p>
