    <p>Visi­tors to Gar­dens by the Bay can now look for­ward to en­joy­ing its Flo­ral Fan­tasy at­trac­tion that is re­open­ing today.</p>
    <p>The draw will fea­ture Joy, a 5mtall sculp­ture made of dried and pre­served flow­ers, which will be un­veiled for the first time.</p>
    <p>A gi­ant wood­land troll, a fairy and a bird – crafted by lo­cal pup­peteer Frankie Malachi – will stand guard over it.</p>
    <p>Hang­ing bas­kets filled with fuch­sias from Ja­pan will be on dis­play, along with flow­ers and plants grown by hor­ti­cul­tur­ists at Gar­dens by the Bay’s own nurs­eries, in­clud­ing or­chids, pelargo­ni­ums, petu­nias, tilland­sias and bromeli­ads.</p>
    <p>The at­trac­tion will also ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties to col­lab­o­rate with as­pir­ing artists and dis­play their flo­ral-themed works.</p>
    <p>Since July, Gar­dens by the Bay has re­opened its tick­eted at­trac­tions in phases, in com­pli­ance with Covid-19 mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to re­open Flo­ral Fan­tasy came af­ter few com­mu­nity cases of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion were re­ported re­cently, to pro­vide res­i­dents here – who are un­able to travel over­seas due to the pan­demic – with op­tions for the up­com­ing fes­tive sea­son.</p>
    <p>The $100 dig­i­tal Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers is­sued by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board can be used for the Flo­ral Fan­tasy at­trac­tion, as well as the Flower Dome and Cloud For­est from next month.</p>
    <p>Gar­dens by the Bay will also re­open the Su­pertree Ob­ser­va­tory from Dec 1. It was pre­vi­ously avail­able only for venue book­ings.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 4D mul­ti­me­dia ride Flight of the Dragon­fly at Flo­ral Fan­tasy will re­main closed.</p>
    <p>Flo­ral Fan­tasy will open from 10am to 7pm on week­days and 10am to 8pm on week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days. Tick­ets for lo­cal res­i­dents are $10 for adults and $5 for chil­dren aged 12 and un­der.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets for non-res­i­dents cost $15 for adults and $9 for chil­dren aged 12 and un­der.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets must be pre-pur­chased on­line from the Gar­dens by the Bay’s web­site or smart­phone app.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion is avail­able at www.gar­dens­bythe­bay.com.sg</p>
