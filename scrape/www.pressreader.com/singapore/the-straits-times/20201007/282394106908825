    <p>MI­LAN • The Serie A sea­son is not at risk, Italy’s Sports Min­is­ter Vin­cenzo Spadafora said on Mon­day, one day af­ter the Ju­ven­tus-Napoli match was aban­doned due to an ap­par­ent con­flict over im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Covid-19 health rules.</p>
    <p>Napoli failed to turn up for the match in Turin, say­ing their lo­cal health author­ity (ASL) would not al­low them to leave Naples af­ter two play­ers tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Serie A, how­ever, re­fused to post­pone the match, ar­gu­ing that the ASL had failed to take into ac­count the health pro­to­cols which had been agreed be­tween the gov­ern­ment and foot­ball au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This stip­u­lates that, even if play­ers test pos­i­tive, the rest of the team can con­tinue to train and play – pro­vided they are neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult of the dis­agree­ment, Ju­ven­tus and match of­fi­cials went to the sta­dium and waited in vain for Napoli to ar­rive, scenes which were highly em­bar­rass­ing for Ital­ian foot­ball.</p>
    <p>Mr Spadafora said on Mon­day that the pro­to­col was still valid al­though he also con­firmed that ASLs could in­ter­vene in cer­tain cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>“We are not at risk of stop­ping the cham­pi­onship,” he told re­porters af­ter meet­ing Ital­ian foot­ball fed­er­a­tion boss Gabriele Grav­ina.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one must fol­low the strict rules of the pro­to­col, if the health sit­u­a­tion changes, we as a gov­ern­ment are also ready to change.</p>
    <p>“The lo­cal health author­ity may in­ter­vene in spe­cial cases,” he added. “The im­por­tant thing is that the in­ter­ven­tion is mo­ti­vated by cer­tain re­quire­ments, al­though these can vary.”</p>
    <p>Grav­ina was equally op­ti­mistic. “If we all care about health pro­tec­tion and the pro­to­col is re­spected by ev­ery­one in its en­tirety, I think we can rest as­sured that the cham­pi­onship can be played and run safely,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ital­ian foot­ball was fur­ther rocked yes­ter­day af­ter Serie A chief Paolo dal Pino tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, send­ing Grav­ina into iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“Asymp­to­matic and in iso­la­tion at home, he (dal Pino) will fol­low the pro­ce­dures set out in the health pro­to­col,” a state­ment read. Grav­ina has also de­cided to quar­an­tine “for pru­den­tial pur­poses, in the ab­sence of symp­toms”.</p>
