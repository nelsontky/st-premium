    <p>The Straits Times will con­tinue to bring read­ers the big sto­ries from around the world, but with an added fo­cus on do­ing so across plat­forms and with more in­ter­ac­tive el­e­ments and fea­tures, ST’s edi­tors said at a trade launch fea­tur­ing its re­vamped prod­uct line-up yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>ST ed­i­tor War­ren Fer­nan­dez, who is also ed­i­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/ Tamil Me­dia Group, said of the re­fresh: “More peo­ple are read­ing The Straits Times today in many more ways on many more plat­forms, and many more times through the day.</p>
    <p>“We know that’s the way all of us are con­sum­ing news. On our phones, tablets, through so­cial me­dia and news­let­ters, as well as the ra­dio.”</p>
    <p>Tak­ing into ac­count these read­er­ship and view­er­ship pat­terns, Mr Fer­nan­dez said every­thing that ST does now will be mul­ti­me­dia to meet the au­di­ences’ chang­ing needs.</p>
    <p>The re­vamp be­gan on Oct 15, when ST’s web­site was given a new look, com­plete with a slew of fresh of­fer­ings that fo­cus on mul­ti­me­dia con­tent and trend­ing top­ics.</p>
    <p>A re­freshed ST app was made avail­able for down­load last week and read­ers can ex­pect a new-look print prod­uct to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>While ST stays true to its mis­sion to cover the news re­li­ably and re­spon­si­bly, there will be greater use of fresh ways of telling the sto­ries of the day, while tap­ping the deep ex­per­tise the news­room has built up over the decades.</p>
    <p>Sum­ming up the re­vamp, Mr Fer­nan­dez said: “There will be some­thing old – our long­stand­ing com­mit­ment to cred­i­ble jour­nal­ism; some­thing new, with new for­mats and fea­tures, which will be a lot more vis­ual, and we will aim to run many more views in our new sec­tions as well.”</p>
    <p>ST also as­pires to jour­ney with read­ers through life, demon­strated by two con­tent ver­ti­cals that will be launched as part of the re­vamp.</p>
    <p>The first, a re­freshed In­vest seg­ment, fea­tures per­sonal fi­nance tips that have been pop­u­lar with read­ers, as well as a fo­cus on jobs, which have been of par­tic­u­lar in­ter­est amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As part of the In­vest sec­tion’s</p>
    <p>MORE WAYS TO GET THE NEWS</p>
    <p>re­vamp, it will get its own mi­crosite on ST’s web­site, which serves as a repos­i­tory for In­vest sto­ries, which are ev­er­green.</p>
    <p>Read­ers can also ex­pect to have in­vest­ment tips dished out through the In­vest news­let­ter, and on se­lected episodes of The Big Story.</p>
    <p>Par­ents can also look for­ward to var­i­ous fea­tures on ST’s new Smart Par­ent­ing mi­crosite, in­clud­ing an Ask The Ex­pert video se­ries that will pose burn­ing ques­tions to par­ent­ing and ed­u­ca­tion pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>SPH chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer Ig­natius Low said that with the plethora of mul­ti­me­dia prod­ucts that ST of­fers, the pa­per is no longer just about print or on­line ban­ner ad­ver­tise­ments.</p>
    <p>“When you say you want to buy into the ST’s au­di­ence, you are re­ally look­ing at an omni-chan­nel value propo­si­tion,” said Mr Low.</p>
    <p>“Today, the ST au­di­ence re­ceives ST through a mul­ti­tude of chan­nels, giv­ing ad­ver­tis­ers mul­ti­ple ways to reach their au­di­ences.”</p>
    <p>Head of cus­tomer and mar­ket­ing of FairPrice Group’s re­tail busi­ness Kelvin Tan said: “With its new omni-chan­nel con­tent ver­ti­cal plat­form such as ST Smart Par­ent­ing, cou­pled with its liq­uid con­tent ap­proach across dig­i­tal, au­dio, video and print, I look for­ward to more end-to-end con­tent in­te­gra­tion on these fronts.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, the new de­sign and sto­ry­telling mech­a­nisms are not only re­fresh­ing, but also timely to pro­vide ar­rest­ing and, more im­por­tantly, trusted con­tent – es­pe­cially dur­ing this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We look for­ward to a more cost­ef­fec­tive, syn­er­gis­tic col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween FairPrice and ST on all lev­els.”</p>
    <p>More peo­ple are read­ing</p>
    <p>The Straits Times today in many more ways on many more plat­forms, and many more times through the day... that’s the way all of us are con­sum­ing news. On our phones, tablets, through so­cial me­dia and news­let­ters, as well as the ra­dio.</p>
    <p>STRAITS TIMES ED­I­TOR WAR­REN FER­NAN­DEZ, who is also ed­i­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/ Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group, on the re­fresh.</p>
