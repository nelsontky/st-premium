    <p>HONG KONG • A growing majority of peo­ple in Hong Kong sup­port the pro-democ­racy move­ment’s goals af­ter China in­tro­duced a na­tional se­cu­rity law for the city, but back­ing for the protest move­ment was a smaller 44 per cent, a sur­vey con­ducted for Reuters showed.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tions have been far fewer and smaller than the mass protests that rocked the Chi­ne­seruled city in the sec­ond half of last year, l argely be­cause of coro­n­avirus-re­lated re­stric­tions on gath­er­ings and the im­pact of the sweep­ing new law, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey taken by the Hong Kong Pub­lic Opin­ion Re­search In­sti­tute (HKPORI) was the first since the law was passed in the Asian fi­nan­cial cen­tre on June 30.</p>
    <p>It found nearly 60 per cent of peo­ple were op­posed to the se­cu­rity law, up from about 57 per cent in HKPORI’s pre­vi­ous sur­vey in June, when few of the de­tails were known.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam’s of­fice and China’s Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice, which comes un­der the State Coun­cil, or Cabi­net, did not re­spond to re­quests for comment about the re­sults of the sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Se­nior lec­turer Ivan Choy of the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong’s depart­ment of govern­ment and pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion said pub­lic at­ti­tudes shifted af­ter the new se­cu­rity law was im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>“Now there are more con­cerns when you ask peo­ple to come out” to protest, he said, adding that po­lice ar­rests have trig­gered “more anger in so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said they have ar­rested 25 peo­ple as at Aug 20, in­clud­ing pro­test­ers, ac­tivists and a me­dia ty­coon, un­der the new law, which makes crimes of se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces pun­ish­able with up to life in prison.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong po­lice force did not re­spond to a re­quest to comment on the im­pact of the ar­rests on pub­lic opin­ion.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has said the law was needed to plug holes in na­tional se­cu­rity ex­posed by the protests and to re­store sta­bil­ity in Hong Kong. The sur­vey found pub­lic sup­port for the law was slightly over 31 per cent.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say the leg­is­la­tion fur­ther eroded the wide-rang­ing free­doms promised to the former Bri­tish colony on its re­turn to Chi­nese rule in 1997 un­der a “one coun­try, two sys­tems” agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The lat­est sur­vey asked: How much do you sup­port or op­pose the pro-democ­racy protest move­ment? The re­sponses showed sup­port at about 44 per cent.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion re­placed one in the June sur­vey that asked: Gen­er­ally speak­ing, how much do you sup­port or op­pose the protest move­ment sur­round­ing the ex­tra­di­tion Bill? The re­sponses showed sup­port at about 51 per cent.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing firm con­clu­sions from the near 7 per­cent­age point drop was dif­fi­cult due to un­cer­tainty over the im­pact of the changed word­ing, Mr Robert Chung, head of HKPORI, said.</p>
    <p>The change was made be­cause the ex­tra­di­tion Bill has faded as an is­sue as it has been with­drawn.</p>
    <p>For the poll, 1,007 re­spon­dents were ran­domly sur­veyed by tele­phone. The re­sults, which had a mar­gin of er­ror of plus or mi­nus 3.2 per­cent­age points as in pre­vi­ous polls, were weighted ac­cord­ing to the lat­est pop­u­la­tion fig­ures.</p>
    <p>While protests have been smaller and less fre­quent, the poll showed back­ing for the pro-democ­racy move­ment’s key as­pi­ra­tions has risen. Sup­port for the re­quest for an in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sion of in­quiry to look into how po­lice han­dled the demon­stra­tions saw a rise of roughly 4 per­cent­age points to 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>The po­lice did not re­spond to a re­quest to comment on the level of pub­lic sup­port for an in­de­pen­dent in­quiry.</p>
    <p>Sup­port for uni­ver­sal suf­frage, an­other key de­mand, re­mains strong with the back­ing of 63 per cent of Hong Kong cit­i­zens, about the same as in the June poll.</p>
    <p>Sup­port for amnesty for the ar­rested pro­test­ers rose to al­most 50 per cent, up five per­cent­age points from June.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam re­mains un­pop­u­lar, with 58 per cent of re­spon­dents say­ing she should re­sign, lit­tle changed from the June poll. Nev­er­the­less, that is an im­prove­ment over per­cep­tions in March, when 63 per cent of re­spon­dents said she should re­sign.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion to the pro-democ­racy move­ment’s de­mands inched down to 19 per cent from 21.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also showed that sup­port for the idea of Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence, which is anath­ema to Bei­jing and a fo­cal point of the new leg­is­la­tion, re­mained at about 20 per cent while op­po­si­tion to in­de­pen­dence hov­ered slightly below 60 per cent.</p>
