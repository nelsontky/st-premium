    <p>The land­lord of a new lux­u­ri­ous condo was es­pe­cially proud that his unit came with the most ex­pen­sive and so­phis­ti­cated kitchen ap­pli­ances. But never did he ex­pect that this would re­sult in a mis­for­tune for him – his ten­ant’s do­mes­tic helper mis­used one of the ap­pli­ances and trig­gered an ex­plo­sion and fire.</p>
    <p>While no one was hurt in the in­ci­dent, the condo suf­fered se­ri­ous dam­age that needed $75,000 to fix. Luck­ily for the owner, he had ad­e­quate home in­sur­ance to pay for it.</p>
    <p>So, if you think that prop­erty in­vest­ment means just col­lect­ing rent to pay for the mort­gage while you sit back and wait for the prop­erty’s value to go up, you should think again.</p>
    <p>Just like any job or busi­ness, be­ing a land­lord comes with risks and obli­ga­tions, and if you are not care­ful, your in­vest­ment may well turn out to be a night­mare.</p>
    <p>While res­i­den­tial rent amounts have not suf­fered as much to date when com­pared with the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, there are signs that de­mand has weak­ened sig­nif­i­cantly as more work­ers lose their jobs or leave Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the cur­rent Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, many land­lords are hav­ing prob­lems with rent­ing out their units now – even those with ex­cel­lent views and in prime districts.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the owner of a two-bed­room apart­ment in the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict had a Ja­panese ex­ec­u­tive who had been pay­ing about $5,000 monthly rent for the past five years. But early this year, the ten­ant was re­called back to his head of­fice due to the out­break and the unit has been va­cant since.</p>
    <p>“He was re­ally a good ten­ant. I got a call from him that he had to leave and that was it. It was so sud­den. It is not easy to find a new ten­ant now be­cause there are many new two-bed­room units in the mar­ket that are look­ing for sim­i­lar ten­ants,” the land­lord, who is in his early 60s, laments.</p>
    <p>Land­lords should ex­er­cise cau­tion even in good times, but more so when the econ­omy is on the skids.</p>
