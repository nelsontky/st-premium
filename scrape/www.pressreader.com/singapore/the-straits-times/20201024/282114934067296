    <p>Be­ing “cat­fished” by fake pro­files is com­mon not just on the In­ter­net, but in na­ture, too.</p>
    <p>Cul­prits in­clude “corpse plants”, which smell of rot­ting flesh and reek of de­ceit. The scent of pu­tre­fied flesh emit­ted by the flow­ers of plants like the Raf­fle­sia and the ti­tan arum is “false ad­ver­tise­ment”, said Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) botanist Shawn Lum.</p>
    <p>Corpse flow­ers tend to lure in­sects that lay their eggs on an­i­mal car­casses or rot­ting veg­e­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>In­sects at­tracted to such flow­ers, mostly var­i­ous groups of flies and bee­tles, think they are fly­ing to a de­com­pos­ing an­i­mal be­cause of the stench, he said.</p>
    <p>“But this is a per­fect ex­am­ple of de­ceit pol­li­na­tion – the promised re­ward turns out to be false ad­ver­tise­ment, such that the plant re­ceives pol­li­na­tion ser­vices with­out pay­ing for it,” added Dr Lum.</p>
    <p>“The pol­li­na­tors, lured by the prom­ise of some­thing good, like a place to lay their eggs, end up pro­vid­ing the ser­vice for free, or even at a cost, as valu­able time and en­ergy in their short adult lives are lost,” he added.</p>
    <p>To add in­sult to in­jury, an in­sect fooled by one corpse plant will be fooled by an­other in or­der to pro­vide the full range of pol­li­na­tion ser­vices – de­liv­er­ing the pollen to an­other flower, Dr Lum said.</p>
    <p>AN EVOLUTIONA­RY RACE</p>
    <p>Wildlife never act al­tru­is­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>Pol­li­na­tors, such as in­sects and mam­mals like bats, visit flow­ers be­cause they get some­thing ben­e­fi­cial in re­turn, such as nec­tar or pollen.</p>
    <p>“The animals act out of self-in­ter­est, while from a plant’s per­spec­tive, of­fer­ing a re­ward such as nec­tar, pollen or waxes is a form of a pay­ment for the pol­li­na­tion ser­vice,” said Dr Lum.</p>
    <p>So how did some flow­ers come to smell nice, while oth­ers do not?</p>
    <p>Hu­mans sep­a­rate the uni­verse of scents into good and bad, but this is sub­jec­tive, said Dr Gwynne Lim from the Lee Kong Chian Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum who has done re­search on the ti­tan arum corpse flower.</p>
    <p>Hu­mans tend to con­sider the smell of fae­ces, car­rion, urine, vomit and rot “bad” be­cause th­ese smells are usu­ally as­so­ci­ated with pathogens that cause us to fall sick, said Dr Lim.</p>
    <p>But to other animals such as car­rion flies, the scents th­ese things pro­duce are at­trac­tive, be­cause they sig­nal a food source or a place to lay their eggs. And over time, plants have evolved to mimic more closely the scents that are at­trac­tive to their pol­li­na­tors.</p>
    <p>“Plants that mimic th­ese odours more closely at­tract more in­sects, and are likely to have more suc­cess at be­ing pol­li­nated,” said Dr Lim.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, their in­sect pol­li­na­tors are also un­der­go­ing se­lec­tion pres­sure – short-lived in­sects that are eas­ily fooled by the smell of corpse flow­ers may have used valu­able time and en­ergy trav­el­ling from bloom to bloom, and may end up hav­ing fewer off­spring than more dis­crim­i­nat­ing mem­bers of their species.</p>
    <p>“Plants that man­age to more closely mimic at­trac­tive scents to their pol­li­na­tors were more likely</p>
    <p>to pro­duce suc­cess­ful off­spring than the mem­bers of their species that do not. At the same time, in­sects are also be­ing se­lected against be­ing de­ceived,” said Dr Lim.</p>
    <p>This means that over suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions, plants like the ti­tan arum in­creas­ingly re­sem­ble car­rion in terms of scent and other sen­sory char­ac­ter­is­tics, such as how it looks, its tem­per­a­ture and tex­ture, while their in­sect pol­li­na­tors be­come more dis­crim­i­nat­ing, she added.</p>
    <p>“It’s a never-end­ing evolutiona­ry arms race.”</p>
    <p>NTU’s Dr Lum said in­sects that are un­wit­ting vic­tims of corpse plants are usu­ally not bees or but­ter</p>
    <p>flies, which are quick learn­ers.</p>
    <p>He added: “They are more of­ten species of flies or bee­tles that are not as quick to dis­cern the gen­uine ar­ti­cle, a corpse, from the im­i­ta­tion, a corpse flower.”</p>
    <p>CORPSE FLOWER WITH NO BODY</p>
    <p>The flow­ers of Raf­fle­sia, which can be found in na­tions like Malaysia and In­done­sia, are one of the most well-known of foul-smelling plants.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Jean Yong of the Swedish Univer­sity of Agri­cul­tural Sciences said the Raf­fle­sia is a com­plete par­a­site. It has no “body” – with no stem and no leaves – and gets its nu­tri­tion and wa­ter from mi</p>
    <p>cro­scopic strands em­bed­ded in the stem tis­sues of its host plant, usu­ally liana vines from the genus Te­trastigma.</p>
    <p>But the slow growth of Raf­fle­sia is caus­ing th­ese plants to be very rare in the wild. The adap­ta­tion of Raf­fle­sia to car­rion fly pol­li­na­tion is a suc­cess­ful evolutiona­ry strat­egy, said Prof Yong, but their low num­bers to­day can be at­trib­uted to habi­tat dis­tur­bances.</p>
    <p>NATIVE CORPSE PLANTS</p>
    <p>The Raf­fle­sia and ti­tan arum are not native to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But the Repub­lic is home to a num­ber of other plants that smell of de­cay. They in­clude native</p>
    <p>plants like the voodoo lily ( Amor­phophal­lus prainii) and or­chids named af­ter the Greek mon­ster Me­dusa ( Bul­bo­phyl­lum medusae), said Ms Lil­ian Kwok, direc­tor of hor­ti­cul­ture and com­mu­nity gar­den­ing at the Na­tional Parks Board.</p>
    <p>The native voodoo lily, for ex­am­ple, emits a pu­trid odour from late af­ter­noon, to at­tract po­ten­tial pol­li­na­tors such as car­rion flies and bee­tles, said Ms Kwok.</p>
    <p>“This species can be found in our forests in the na­ture re­serve, but it is known to be rare lo­cally. It thrives in well-drained and fer­tile soil,” she said.</p>
