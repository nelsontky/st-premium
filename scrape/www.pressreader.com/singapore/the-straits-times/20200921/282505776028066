    <p>I saw Se­bas­tian (not his real name) at the Emer­gency Room at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health (IMH) about two months ago af­ter he al­most took his own life. He was fac­ing prob­lems at work and with his mar­riage, and had turned to al­co­hol to re­lieve his stress.</p>
    <p>One evening, he had re­turned home to find that his wife had moved out with their tod­dler Mag­gie. She also blocked his calls and mes­sages.</p>
    <p>Feel­ing frus­trated and de­pressed, Se­bas­tian drank to drown his sor­rows.</p>
    <p>He was un­sure how much time had passed when he heard some­one shout­ing at him from the op­po­site block.</p>
    <p>Se­bas­tian re­ported “wak­ing up”, pre­sum­ably from his in­tox­i­cated state on his win­dow ledge. He re­mem­bered nearly slip­ping from his po­si­tion and cling­ing onto the win­dow grill with all his strength.</p>
    <p>He told me that he re­alised that every­thing in his life that he thought was hope­less, seemed to­tally fix­able.</p>
    <p>The po­lice soon ar­rived and took him to the hos­pi­tal. His neigh­bour had called the po­lice for help.</p>
    <p>At IMH’s Emer­gency Room, we see sev­eral pa­tients like Se­bas­tian ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Al­though the sui­cide rate in Sin­ga­pore has gone down over the years, there are still ap­prox­i­mately 400 per­sons who die by sui­cide ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>And, for ev­ery one per­son who died by sui­cide, there are at least four to five who made the at­tempt, and many more who are af­fected by it. One re­cent study sug­gested that each death by sui­cide would af­fect at least 135 per­sons who may be af­fected emo­tion­ally by the tragedy.</p>
    <p>Sui­cide pre­ven­tion thus re­mains an im­por­tant part of pub­lic health. Dif­fer­ent strate­gies have been pro­posed, in­clud­ing pub­lic aware­ness cam­paigns, school-based men­tal health train­ing and im­proved me­dia re­port­ing.</p>
    <p>The most ef­fec­tive method ap­pears to be re­stric­tion of ac­cess to means. The prob­lem is that out of the 400 or so per­sons who die by sui­cide in Sin­ga­pore each year, al­most three quar­ters of them fell from heights. About 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion live in high-rise build­ings.</p>
    <p>We there­fore need to fo­cus our ef­forts to ad­dress other im­por­tant risk fac­tors for sui­cides, specif­i­cally</p>
    <p>Par­ents, schools and so­ci­ety have re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to the young to help them ac­quire knowl­edge and skills to over­come ad­ver­si­ties in their lives. This gives them hope and the be­lief that prob­lems are fix­able, and end­ing it all should not be their course of ac­tion.</p>
    <p>those that ad­dress im­pul­siv­ity.</p>
    <p>One of the ear­li­est stud­ies that showed sui­cides are “cri­sis-ori­ented” and acute in na­ture was pub­lished in 1978 by Dr Richard Sei­den.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 1937 and 1971, a to­tal of 515 peo­ple were stopped be­fore they jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Fran­cisco. Af­ter an av­er­age of about 26 years, 94 per cent of th­ese peo­ple were ei­ther still alive, or had died of nat­u­ral causes.</p>
    <p>This means that if a sui­ci­dal per­son can get through his cri­sis, chances are ex­tremely good that he would not kill him­self later.</p>
    <p>A more re­cent study re­ported that fewer than 10 per cent of sur­vivors, even of near-lethal sui­cide at­tempts, go on to die by sui­cide. This shows that pre­vent­ing a sui­cide today will likely save the per­son’s life in the long run.</p>
    <p>Based on sci­en­tific ev­i­dence, and from the pa­tients at the IMH Emer­gency Room, we know that many sui­ci­dal crises are fleet­ing.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral stud­ies done of near-lethal sui­cide at­tempts showed that up to 90 per cent of sui­cide at­tempters de­cided to end their lives in less than eight hours be­fore ac­tu­ally at­tempt­ing sui­cide. In fact, al­most half of them took less than 10 min­utes from de­ci­sion to at­tempt.</p>
    <p>Th­ese sug­gest that the ma­jor­ity of sui­cides are im­pul­sive. When we look at the risk fac­tors for sui­cide, many of them high­light the role that im­pul­siv­ity plays.</p>
    <p>Sui­cide risk is sig­nif­i­cantly higher in men and in youth, who tend to be more im­pul­sive.</p>
    <p>A risk fac­tor for sui­cides is hav­ing a men­tal health con­di­tion. Pa­tients with cer­tain psy­chi­atric ill­nesses do have a propen­sity for im­pul­siv­ity, es­pe­cially when the con­di­tion has be­come more se­vere.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients with de­pres­sion may be ir­ri­ta­ble, im­pul­sive and have poorer judg­ment com­pared to when they are well. Hence, early de­tec­tion, as well as treat­ment, of men­tal health con­di­tions is im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Other fac­tors in­clude the use of al­co­hol or other sub­stances, such as il­licit drugs like am­phet­a­mines. From speak­ing with those who at­tempted sui­cide, I know that al­co­hol use be­fore or around the time of the sui­ci­dal act is com­mon.</p>
    <p>Al­co­hol use leads to greater im­pul­siv­ity even in the ab­sence of an al­co­hol use dis­or­der. It af­fects judg­ment and can lead to ex­treme ex­pe­ri­ences of emo­tions, which are also trig­gers for sui­ci­dal­ity.</p>
    <p>Apart from ad­dress­ing risk fac­tors, we also need to im­prove cop­ing skills and build up the re­silience of in­di­vid­u­als, es­pe­cially our youth so that they can nav­i­gate through crises and stres­sors in life.</p>
    <p>Par­ents, schools and so­ci­ety have re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to the young to help them ac­quire knowl­edge and skills to over­come ad­ver­si­ties in their lives. This gives them hope and the be­lief that prob­lems are fix­able, and end­ing it all should not be their course of ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Sui­cide is an ex­tremely com­plex is­sue and pre­ven­tion ef­forts re­quire co­or­di­na­tion and col­lab­o­ra­tion among all sec­tors of so­ci­ety, not just health. Th­ese sec­tors in­clude ed­u­ca­tion, labour, jus­tice, law, de­fence, pol­i­tics and the me­dia.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the sup­port­ive and nur­tur­ing role that fam­ily mem­bers and friends play can­not be un­der­es­ti­mated.</p>
    <p>All th­ese ef­forts must be com­pre­hen­sive and in­te­grated as no sin­gle ap­proach alone can make an im­pact on an is­sue as com­plex as sui­cide. Pre­vent­ing a sui­cide today will save the per­son’s life in the long run.</p>
