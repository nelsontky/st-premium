    <p>Much of the world’s at­ten­tion has been fixed on the af­ter­math of last month’s US pres­i­den­tial and con­gres­sional elec­tions. But a wide range of other eye-catch­ing bal­lots in the next 12 months around the world will shape not just do­mes­tic pol­i­tics and eco­nom­ics, but also in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions, well into the 2020s.</p>
    <p>The out­comes of th­ese elec­tions, in­clud­ing in Iran, Is­rael, Ger­many and Ja­pan, are un­cer­tain. Yet what is cer­tain is that there will be a change of lead­er­ship in sev­eral of th­ese “mid­dle power” states, with sev­eral long­stand­ing politi­cians step­ping down, or po­ten­tially be­ing voted out.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man elec­tion, in Europe’s most in­flu­en­tial state, is a stand­out among them, with Septem­ber’s bal­lot bring­ing an end to the long chan­cel­lor­ship of Dr An­gela Merkel, who will not con­tinue to serve as leader of the cen­tre-right Chris­tian Demo­cratic Union (CDU).</p>
    <p>The CDU, which with its sis­ter party the Chris­tian So­cial Union (CSU) is well ahead in the polls, will elect a new leader next month who will be in pole po­si­tion to be the na­tion’s next leader.</p>
    <p>There are three de­clared can­di­dates for the CDU/CSU crown so far: North Rhine-West­phalia state premier Ar­min Laschet, cor­po­rate lawyer Friedrich Merz and for­eign af­fairs ex­pert Nor­bert Rottgen. How­ever, polls of party mem­bers in­di­cate that the strong favourite is Bavar­ian state premier Markus Soeder, who has im­pressed many with his ro­bust re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Who­ever re­places Dr Merkel, who has been a dom­i­nant fig­ure in Euro­pean pol­i­tics for over a decade and a half, will have to fill the very big shoes she leaves be­hind.</p>
    <p>To put her longevity into wider per­spec­tive, four Amer­i­can pres­i­dents (Mr Ge­orge W. Bush, Mr Barack Obama, Mr Don­ald Trump and, soon, Mr Joe Bi­den), four French pres­i­dents (Mr Jacques Chirac, Mr Ni­co­las Sarkozy, Mr Fran­cois Hol­lande and Mr Em­manuel Macron) and five Bri­tish prime min­is­ters (Mr Tony Blair, Mr Gor­don Brown, Mr David Cameron, Mrs Theresa May and Mr Boris John­son) have so far served their coun­tries dur­ing her ten­ure.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal legacy of a vet­eran leader will also be key to the Ja­panese gen­eral elec­tion next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Shinzo Abe stepped down as prime min­is­ter in Septem­ber af­ter be­com­ing the long­est-serv­ing premier in the na­tion’s his­tory. His suc­ces­sor Yoshi­hide Suga, who was Mr Abe’s long-serv­ing aide, has to lead the Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) into a gen­eral elec­tion, which must be held be­fore Oct 22. While the LDP is ex­pected to be re­turned to power, how well it per­forms at the polls un­der Mr Suga’s lead­er­ship will af­fect how much lee­way he has as party leader to set his own agenda.</p>
    <p>IN THE MID­DLE EAST</p>
    <p>In Is­rael, an­other long­stand­ing in­cum­bent, Mr Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu, is look­ing to hang on to power in the na­tion’s fourth bal­lot in two years.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu, who is the na­tion’s long­est-ever serv­ing prime min­is­ter, may have to face the vote in the next few months. But his odds of vic­tory short­ened on Dec 8 when Mr Gideon Saar, a lead­ing ri­val in­side the gov­ern­ing right-of-cen­tre Likud, broke away to form a new po­lit­i­cal party.</p>
    <p>Mean­while in Iran, the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion that will take place in June moved up in tempo when for­mer de­fence min­is­ter, Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Hos­sein De­hghan, an­nounced re­cently that he is run­ning for the post.</p>
    <p>As in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani nears the end of his two terms, Brig-Gen De­hghan, who serves as the top mil­i­tary ad­viser to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and has been sub­ject to United States sanc­tions since Novem­ber last year, is be­lieved to have the back­ing of the lat­ter as well as the sup­port of the rev­o­lu­tion­ary guards and other key con­ser­va­tive groups.</p>
    <p>Part of the rea­son he may prove a for­mi­da­ble can­di­date is that the po­lit­i­cal wind ap­pears to be cur­rently blow­ing in favour of con­ser­va­tives af­ter they scored a big ma­jor­ity in the par­lia­men­tary elec­tions ear­lier this year. While Brig-Gen De­hghan served in Mr Rouhani’s first ad­min­is­tra­tion as de­fence min­is­ter, he has since been crit­i­cal of the re­formist pres­i­dent, and re­cently warned against any US mil­i­tary es­ca­la­tion in US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s fi­nal weeks in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing back to Europe, there will also be a very im­por­tant bal­lot in Scot­land in May which could turn out to be the hand­maiden to a sec­ond in­de­pen­dence ref­er­en­dum there within a decade.</p>
    <p>The first such plebiscite in 2014 was lost 55-45 by the Scot­tish Na­tional Party. How­ever, sup­port for the party has surged since and some polls in­di­cate that more than 50 per cent of vot­ers now favour in­de­pen­dence. One po­ten­tial “game-changer” here could be Brexit, which 68 per cent of the Scot­tish elec­torate voted against in 2016.</p>
    <p>GE­OR­GIA ON THEIR MIND</p>
    <p>In the Amer­i­cas, the most con­se­quen­tial elec­tion may not be a na­tional one, but at the state level in Ge­or­gia in the United States on Jan 5. If Democrats win the two Se­nate run-off elec­tions, that party will win con­trol of the Se­nate along­side its ex­ist­ing grip on power in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>Such an out­come could be trans­for­ma­tive for the first two years of Mr Bi­den’s pres­i­dency, as it will make it much more likely for him to get ap­proval for the bulk of his do­mes­tic leg­isla­tive agenda.</p>
    <p>While the Ge­or­gia bal­lot is key for Mr Bi­den’s home agenda, the changes in lead­er­ship in sev­eral piv­otal pow­ers, from Iran to Ger­many, will shape US for­eign pol­icy dur­ing his pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>So although the in­com­ing pres­i­dent may wel­come Mr Ne­tanyahu los­ing power in Is­rael, he will miss Dr Merkel’s deep in­ter­na­tional ex­pe­ri­ence, while the end of Mr Rouhani’s term may re­sult in a much more com­pli­cated land­scape for any Amer­i­can over­ture to Teheran.</p>
