    <p>Why would peo­ple pay to learn how to cre­ate pre­sen­ta­tion slides?</p>
    <p>That was Ms Koh Kai Xin’s first thought, when Mr Eu­gene Cheng floated the idea to her years ago.</p>
    <p>It turns out that pro­duc­ing clear, per­sua­sive and high-im­pact pre­sen­ta­tions is a skill many want.</p>
    <p>To­day the duo, who grad­u­ated from Ngee Ann Polytech­nic’s busi­ness school in 2013, run a cre­ative agency, HighS­park, which pre­pares pre­sen­ta­tions for hun­dreds of clients, in­clud­ing Visa and Nike.</p>
    <p>From a start­ing cap­i­tal of just over $1,000 in 2013, the busi­ness has pulled in a seven-fig­ure sum in rev­enue in its lat­est fi­nan­cial year, which ended in July.</p>
    <p>This year, Ms Koh and Mr Cheng, both 27, also made Forbes’ list of 300 young en­trepreneur­s and lead­ers across Asia un­der the age of 30.</p>
    <p>The idea sur­faced when Mr</p>
    <p>Cheng started up­load­ing Pow­erPoint pre­sen­ta­tions on a slide-shar­ing plat­form on­line.</p>
    <p>“In busi­ness school, we had a lot of pre­sen­ta­tions that were graded, and dur­ing one com­pe­ti­tion, I wanted to make sure that our pre­sen­ta­tion stood out, so I read up a lot on de­sign, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and per­sua­sion, and learnt some soft­ware,” said Mr Cheng.</p>
    <p>In his fi­nal year of school, he re­ceived a call from a Ja­panese ad­ver­tis­ing agency, which wanted him to de­sign a busi­ness pre­sen­ta­tion for its chief ex­ec­u­tive. That was when he first re­alised he could turn his ex­per­tise into a busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Koh: “Any­one would be able to put to­gether a deck of slides, but to do so ef­fec­tively and strate­gi­cally is an­other ques­tion.”</p>
    <p>They had to turn con­vo­luted and over­crowded slides into vis­ually ap­peal­ing and or­gan­ised pre­sen­ta­tions for busi­ness lead­ers to en­gage their au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>Ngee Ann Polytech­nic pro­vided them seed fund­ing of $3,000, and an in­cu­ba­tor space that was al­most rent-free in the first year.</p>
    <p>HighS­park has now han­dled about 600 projects for its clients, which come from var­i­ous in­dus­tries, from re­tail to tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, their youth seemed to be an ob­sta­cle when they had to work with busi­ness pro­fes­sion­als. Said Ms Koh: “But you re­alise peo­ple come with dif­fer­ent ex­per­tise.”</p>
    <p>The pair said that run­ning their own busi­ness has taught them per­se­ver­ance and the value of stay­ing cu­ri­ous about new ideas. “En­trepreneur­ship isn’t for ev­ery­one. You’re giv­ing and sac­ri­fic­ing a lot... It’s not easy,” said Mr Cheng.</p>
    <p>Any­one would be able to put to­gether a deck of slides, but to do so ef­fec­tively and strate­gi­cally is an­other ques­tion.</p>
