    <p>•</p>
    <p>China yes­ter­day ac­cused US sen­a­tors of telling “all kinds of lies” af­ter a group of law­mak­ers put for­ward a res­o­lu­tion ac­cus­ing Bei­jing of geno­cide against Mus­lim mi­nor­ity groups in the far north-western re­gion of Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing are at their worst in years over a se­ries of flash­points, in­clud­ing trade, tech­nol­ogy and hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>The text put for­ward by sen­a­tors from across Wash­ing­ton’s po­lit­i­cal di­vide al­leged China was guilty of a cam­paign “against Uighurs, eth­nic Kaza­khs, Kyr­gyz and mem­bers of other Mus­lim mi­nor­ity groups” that “con­sti­tutes geno­cide”.</p>
    <p>“This res­o­lu­tion recog­nises these crimes for what they are and is the first step to­wards hold­ing China ac­count­able for their monstrous ac­tions,” said Sen­a­tor John Cornyn, a Repub­li­can who spon­sored it.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Jeff Merkley, a Demo­crat, said the res­o­lu­tion would show that the United States “can’t stay si­lent”. He added: “China’s as­sault on Uighurs and other Mus­lim mi­nor­ity groups – es­ca­lat­ing sur­veil­lance, im­pris­on­ment, tor­ture and forced ‘re-ed­u­ca­tion camps’ – is geno­cide, pure and sim­ple.”</p>
    <p>Fur­ther fu­elling the crit­i­cism, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pompeo told In­dian news site The Print on Tues­day that China’s ac­tions in Xin­jiang “re­mind us of what hap­pened in the 1930s in Ger­many”.</p>
    <p>But Bei­jing an­grily hit back yes­ter­day, say­ing the “so-called geno­cide in Xin­jiang is a ru­mour de­lib­er­ately con­cocted by some an­tiChina forces”.</p>
    <p>The sen­si­tive re­gion is tightly con­trolled by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties, and rights groups say more than one mil­lion Uighurs have been de­tained in camps.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing de­fends the camps as vo­ca­tional train­ing cen­tres to stamp out ter­ror­ism and im­prove job op­por­tu­ni­ties. “The US sen­a­tors you men­tioned have al­ways been anti-China and are keen to con­coct all kinds of lies to dis­credit China and use them to seek their own po­lit­i­cal gains,” for­eign min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told re­porters.</p>
    <p>He also turned the ta­bles on China’s crit­ics, at­tack­ing the US for the “as­sim­i­la­tion and mas­sacres of Na­tive Amer­i­cans in history to greatly re­duce their pop­u­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>“We urge cer­tain US politi­cians to re­spect the facts, stop fab­ri­cat­ing lies, and stop us­ing Xin­jiang-re­lated is­sues to in­ter­fere in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs.”</p>
    <p>A re­port ear­lier this month from the Aus­tralian Strate­gic Pol­icy In­sti­tute think-tank said the network of de­ten­tion cen­tres in Xin­jiang is much big­ger than pre­vi­ously thought, de­spite China’s claims that many Uighurs have been re­leased.</p>
    <p>Ms Olivia Enos, a se­nior pol­icy an­a­lyst at the con­ser­va­tive Her­itage Foun­da­tion who stud­ies hu­man rights in Asia, said that a geno­cide res­o­lu­tion on Xin­jiang could put pres­sure on the US ad­min­is­tra­tion to fol­low suit and pave the way for ad­di­tional sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously it would be great to have the ex­ec­u­tive branch say that this is geno­cide and/or crimes against hu­man­ity,” she said. “But I think, in lieu of that, this would be a very strong, bi­par­ti­san mes­sage that the US gov­ern­ment cares about the state of the Uighur peo­ple, even and es­pe­cially when the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party does not,” she said.</p>
    <p>SPEAK­ING UP AGAINST ATROC­I­TIES</p>
    <p>China’s as­sault on Uighurs and other Mus­lim mi­nor­ity groups – es­ca­lat­ing sur­veil­lance, im­pris­on­ment, tor­ture and forced ‘re-ed­u­ca­tion camps’ – is geno­cide, pure and sim­ple.</p>

    <p>LY­ING FOR THEIR BEN­E­FIT</p>
    <p>The US sen­a­tors you men­tioned have al­ways been anti-China and are keen to con­coct all kinds of lies to dis­credit China and use them to seek their own po­lit­i­cal gains.</p>
