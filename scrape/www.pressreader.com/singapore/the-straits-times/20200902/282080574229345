    <p>For Sin­ga­pore to truly em­brace di­ver­sity, its peo­ple should seek con­sen­sus and not con­flict, even as more al­ter­na­tive voices join the cho­rus, said Ms Ra­hayu Mahzam (Jurong GRC).</p>
    <p>Here are ex­cerpts from her speech in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day:</p>
    <p>I’m en­cour­aged to see our elec­torate ma­tur­ing, and many peo­ple from dif­fer­ent back­grounds step­ping up to con­test the last gen­eral elec­tion, of­fer­ing dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives, as­pir­ing to a bet­ter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Healthy com­pe­ti­tion is good, as we chal­lenge each other to do bet­ter. And in the end, the na­tion ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when peo­ple take the ad­ver­sar­ial process to its ex­treme and as­sert their opin­ions in a very vi­cious man­ner, there is a dan­ger of so­ci­ety be­ing di­vided and po­larised.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cam­paign, in the on­line space, es­pe­cially, we saw some con­struc­tive dis­course, but also some ma­li­cious com­ments be­ing passed, vit­ri­olic re­marks be­ing ex­pressed and per­sonal at­tacks be­ing made, which strayed from the sub­stance of the de­bate and be­came an at­tempt to bring peo­ple down in­stead.</p>
    <p>We have been see­ing some neg­a­tive con­duct on the In­ter­net for some time now. There is in­creas­ing cog­ni­sance of can­cel cul­ture, which is caus­ing some con­cern.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­net and so­cial me­dia have am­pli­fied and caused an evo­lu­tion of this phe­nom­e­non and its reper­cus­sions. For one thing, on­line, a cer­tain is­sue or mat­ter can go vi­ral very quickly, and a mob men­tal­ity can form, long be­fore facts can be ver­i­fied or dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, the dis­trac­tion of all the at­tacks takes at­ten­tion away from the sub­stance of the mat­ter, which is of­ten then lost in the flood of com­ments and crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>A more se­ri­ous side ef­fect is that those with gen­uine views be­come muted, as they fear be­ing judged or lynched by the an­gry mob.</p>
    <p>We have much to learn from the ex­pe­ri­ences of other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as we look to oth­ers for les­sons to de­velop norms in our na­tion, we must pause to ap­pre­ci­ate the im­pact... in our con­text.</p>
    <p>We should be cau­tious not to jump on the band­wagon and copy and paste the play­book in other coun­tries with­out ad­just­ing (it) for our needs.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, we must be keenly aware of our spe­cial de­mo­graph­ics. As a mul­tira­cial, multi-re­li­gious so­ci­ety, mul­tira­cial­ism is a value we hold dear.</p>
    <p>We must there­fore en­sure that in our de­bates and dis­cus­sions, we are mind­ful of the im­pact of our com­ments and the dan­ger of fray­ing our so­cial fab­ric if we pit one group against the other.</p>
    <p>As in­di­vid­u­als, we all have a per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity – re­spon­si­bil­ity to be­have fairly and call out any ac­tion that threat­ens healthy dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>Be­yond hav­ing safe spa­ces or dis­cus­sions on­line and even off­line to truly shape norms, we need to trans­late our dis­cus­sions into real ac­tion.</p>
    <p>I hope to do my part to make this world kinder, more com­pas­sion­ate, more ac­cept­ing of dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>I hope to make this place a bet­ter place for my son, Ay­den. Ay­den, as many of you know, has Down syn­drome. As a par­ent, I worry about how he will be treated when he grows up. I won­der if peo­ple will be pa­tient with him, whether they will be kind and whether he will have the sup­port he needs to live well.</p>
    <p>I’m happy to hear that there will be stronger sup­port for spe­cial needs stu­dents.</p>
    <p>When we talk about im­prov­ing in­fra­struc­ture, it is not enough to just build ramps and a few in­clu­sive play­grounds. We must re­ally nudge be­hav­iours to fa­cil­i­tate and make it con­ve­nient for those who have dis­abil­i­ties to join in all the ac­tiv­i­ties that oth­ers are in­volved in.</p>
    <p>When we talk about cre­at­ing aware­ness and be­ing in­clu­sive in work­places, it is not enough to just in­cen­tivise em­ploy­ers to em­ploy peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties. We must en­cour­age un­der­stand­ing and con­ver­sa­tions amongst em­ploy­ers and co-work­ers, we must learn to see the value and con­tri­bu­tions of peo­ple who may be dif­fer­ently able.</p>
    <p>When we talk about build­ing the ca­pac­ity and ca­pa­bil­ity of ed­u­ca­tors, it may not be enough to just train a se­lect group of teach­ers or pro­vide ba­sic train­ing for teach­ers.</p>
    <p>As I said in my maiden speech in this House, we may not al­ways agree with each other, but we de­bate, re­spect­fully. I be­lieve this deco­rum can ex­tend be­yond this House.</p>
    <p>And I hope as a na­tion, we al­ways seek con­sen­sus, not con­flict. I hope as a na­tion, we em­brace our dif­fer­ences, and be kind and com­pas­sion­ate, al­ways.</p>

        <p data-role="text">MP Liang Eng Hwa said there is a need for for&#xAD;eign labour in sec&#xAD;tors like con&#xAD;struc&#xAD;tion, but more must be done to im&#xAD;prove pro&#xAD;duc&#xAD;tiv&#xAD;ity. The Govern&#xAD;ment can en&#xAD;cour&#xAD;age it, for in&#xAD;stance, by award&#xAD;ing ten&#xAD;ders to firms that use pro&#xAD;duc&#xAD;tive con&#xAD;struc&#xAD;tion meth&#xAD;ods, and rely less on for&#xAD;eign work&#xAD;ers.</p>
