    <p>The on­set of cold weather in China has re­newed con­cerns of a pos­si­ble resur­gence in Covid-19 cases, forc­ing the au­thor­i­ties to ne­go­ti­ate a tricky bal­ance be­tween con­tain­ing the virus and keep­ing its barely re­cov­ered econ­omy open.</p>
    <p>As China set­tles into a chilly au­tumn, epi­demi­ol­o­gists have been warn­ing of a pos­si­ble resur­gence in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions that could come with lower tem­per­a­tures, forc­ing the au­thor­i­ties to walk a fine line be­tween con­tain­ing the virus and keep­ing its barely re­cov­ered econ­omy open.</p>
    <p>There are early in­di­ca­tions of the com­plex­ity: Xin­jiang, China’s largest re­gion, has seen two out­breaks in the past four months.</p>
    <p>Since sum­mer, as cases started to fall and in­tra-prov­ince travel re­stric­tions were lifted, in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­perts had been warn­ing that a dip in the mer­cury could lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>As it gets colder, peo­ple stay in­doors and close their doors and win­dows, creat­ing poor ven­ti­la­tion, said Dr Koh Hau Tek, deputy chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer of Ji­ahui Health in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>In an en­closed space, when some­one sneezes or coughs, the droplets linger, and could lead to an in­crease in res­pi­ra­tory tract dis­eases.</p>
    <p>“This is why when the weather gets colder, we see more cases of in­fluenza. And the same could be said for Covid-19, which is also a res­pi­ra­tory tract dis­ease,” said Dr Koh.</p>
    <p>China is gear­ing up for a colder-than-usual win­ter as the La Nina weather pat­tern oc­cur­ring this year is likely to bring more fre­quent cold spells. With the pan­demic con­tin­u­ing to rage in the Amer­i­cas, and Europe ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, there are in­creased con­cerns of im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>Should bor­ders be re­opened, there could be up to seven mil­lion in­fec­tions in the coun­try and 200,000 deaths, China’s top epi­demi­ol­o­gist warned.</p>
    <p>“Our coun­try is com­ing un­der global pres­sure (about our strat­egy to keep bor­ders closed) ,” Dr Wu Zun­you of the China Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion said in an in­ter­view with China Newsweek pub­lished on Oct 24, adding that there have been in­ter­na­tional calls for the coun­try to con­tinue re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter clos­ing its bor­ders to all for­eign­ers in end-March and lim­it­ing in­ter­na­tional flights to once a week per car­rier, China has since al­lowed for­eign­ers with valid res­i­dence per­mits to re-en­ter the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has also set up “green lanes” with sev­eral coun­tries in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, al­low­ing for quar­an­tine-free travel for cer­tain in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>China does not want to see its ef­forts in con­tain­ing the out­break wiped out, but the coun­try’s hard­won suc­cess is pre­car­i­ous.</p>
    <p>Last week­end, a new clus­ter sur­faced in the far western re­gion of Xin­jiang, an area that shares a bor­der with seven coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties rapidly put Kash­gar un­der lock­down, can­celled flights and mass-tested the en­tire city of 4.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>By yes­ter­day, 183 in­fec­tions had been de­tected, mostly asymp­to­matic cases. All of them were linked to a 17-year-old gar­ment fac­tory worker in Kash­gar who went home to see her par­ents in a nearby vil­lage only ev­ery fort­night or so.</p>
    <p>But de­spite spo­radic out­breaks, most Chi­nese have lit­tle to worry about be­cause the virus is largely un­der con­trol in the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion, Dr Wu said.</p>
    <p>In much of the coun­try, life feels nor­mal again, with the econ­omy show­ing strong signs of a re­bound in the last quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Mass gath­er­ings have grad­u­ally re­turned while do­mes­tic tourism has also seen an uptick.</p>
    <p>Still, con­cerns re­main about another win­ter killer: sea­sonal in­fluenza.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, be­tween three and five mil­lion peo­ple fall se­ri­ously ill with the flu ev­ery year, which kills be­tween 290,000 and 650,000, ac­cord­ing to data from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>Yet there ap­pears to be fewer cases than usual this year, the WHO said, partly be­cause the pan­demic has kept peo­ple wor­ried about catch­ing Covid-19 away from healthcare providers, while also redi­rect­ing med­i­cal re­sources, which could lead to in­com­plete re­port­ing of flu cases.</p>
    <p>Cou­pled with a coro­n­avirus out­break, the worry is that the healthcare sys­tem could be­come over­whelmed, Dr Wu warned.</p>
    <p>While doc­tors have ad­vo­cated get­ting vac­ci­nated for the sea­sonal flu, gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers have said the jabs are in short sup­ply this year.</p>
    <p>“It could be be­cause there’s a higher de­mand for it, so the stock we’ve been as­signed is lower,” said a doc­tor at a pri­vate hos­pi­tal, who de­clined to be named in order to freely dis­cuss the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“But many of us be­lieve another rea­son is be­cause man­u­fac­tur­ers have de­ployed re­sources to work on the new Covid-19 vac­cine, which means less flu vac­cine is get­ting pro­duced,” he said.</p>
