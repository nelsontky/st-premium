    <p>LON­DON • Yuki Tsun­oda will race for Red Bull-owned Al­phaTauri next sea­son as For­mula One’s first Ja­panese driver since 2014, the team an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old, who re­places Daniil Kvyat, fin­ished third in this year’s For­mula Two cham­pi­onship with seven podi­ums, in­clud­ing vic­tory in two fea­ture races and a sprint race.</p>
    <p>Tsun­oda will be the first driver born this mil­len­nium to race for an F1 team and will be the sec­ond Asian driver on next year’s grid af­ter Bri­tish-born Thai Alexan­der Al­bon, whose spot with Red Bull re­mains up in the air.</p>
    <p>The last Ja­panese driver on the grid was Ka­mui Kobayashi with the now-de­funct Cater­ham team.</p>
    <p>“Like most rac­ing driv­ers, it has al­ways been my goal to race in For­mula One, so I’m very happy with this news,” Tsun­oda said in a state­ment. “I re­alise that I will be car­ry­ing the hopes of a lot of Ja­panese F1 fans next year and I will be do­ing my best for them too.”</p>
    <p>Al­phaTauri prin­ci­pal Franz Tost, whose Italy-based team pre­vi­ously raced as Toro Rosso, said they had been keep­ing an eye on Tsun­oda’s ca­reer for a while now.</p>
    <p>“Watch­ing him in For­mula Two this year, he has demon­strated the right mix of rac­ing ag­gres­sion and good tech­ni­cal un­der­stand­ing,” he said. “Dur­ing the test in Imola in Novem­ber when he drove our 2018 car, his lap times were very con­sis­tent over a race sim­u­la­tion. He pro­gressed through­out the day and gave our en­gi­neers use­ful feed­back.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, his in­te­gra­tion with the Honda en­gi­neers has been seam­less, which cer­tainly helps.”</p>
    <p>Tsun­oda is a pro­tege of Honda, who will be sup­ply­ing the en­gines for Al­phaTauri un­til next year.</p>
    <p>His F2 team boss Trevor Car­lin re­cently said he is the best Ja­panese prospect since Takuma Sato, now a dou­ble In­di­anapo­lis 500 win­ner.</p>
    <p>Tsun­oda will part­ner French driver Pierre Gasly, who claimed his first win in F1 as well as the team’s first vic­tory as Al­phaTauri at the Ital­ian Grand Prix this year.</p>
    <p>The move leaves only one seat left to be con­firmed for next year, with Red Bull yet to de­cide on whether to per­sist with Al­bon or to go with Ser­gio Perez, who im­pressed with Rac­ing Point af­ter fin­ish­ing fourth over­all this sea­son but has been jet­ti­soned for Se­bas­tian Vet­tel from Fer­rari.</p>
    <p>Reign­ing world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton’s con­tract runs out in a few weeks but it will be a shock if he does not stay with Mercedes, the con­struc­tors’ cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>Kvyat, still only 26, has now been dropped three times by Red Bull in his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian made his de­but with Toro Rosso in 2014. He was pro­moted to Red Bull Rac­ing in 2015 and de­moted again in 2016.</p>
    <p>Then in 2017, he was dropped by Toro Rosso be­fore mak­ing a come­back last year.</p>
    <p>Kvyat has al­ready come to terms with his fate, say­ing: “I’ll try to come back, be­cause I feel like in the right am­bi­ence with the right peo­ple around me in the right car, which I like, I can be ex­tremely com­pet­i­tive. And I still feel like I have a lot to give.”</p>
