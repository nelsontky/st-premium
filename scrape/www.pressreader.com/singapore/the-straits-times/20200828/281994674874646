    <p>BUENOS AIRES • Melt­wa­ter could un­der­mine the walls of ice hold­ing back Antarc­tica’s glaciers, sci­en­tists re­ported, a find­ing that un­der­scores con­cern about the po­ten­tial for a sig­nif­i­cant sea-level rise.</p>
    <p>The ice shelves, formed over thou­sands of years, serve as dams to pre­vent much of the con­ti­nent’s snow and ice from flow­ing to­wards the ocean.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists found that about 60 per cent of the ice shelf area is vul­ner­a­ble to a process called hy­drofrac­tur­ing, in which melt­wa­ter seeps into the shelves’ crevasses, some of which are hun­dreds of me­tres deep, and trig­gers col­lapse.</p>
    <p>“This melt­wa­ter is heav­ier than ice, so it can pen­e­trate through the en­tire ice thick­ness, just like a knife,” said cli­mate sci­en­tist Lai Ching-yao at Columbia Uni­ver­sity’s Earth In­sti­tute in New York.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how long such a process might take. Antarc­tic weather is highly vari­able, mak­ing it dif­fi­cult for sci­en­tists to de­ter­mine how much of a role is be­ing played by hu­man-caused cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Dr Lai said, how­ever, that pre­vi­ous re­search sug­gested melt­wa­ter could cover the ice shelves in about a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>The new study, pub­lished in the jour­nal Na­ture, used ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to iden­tify ice-frac­ture fea­tures in nearly 260 satel­lite images of 50 ice shelves across the con­ti­nent. Those ice shelves sur­round about 75 per cent of the Antarc­tic coast­line.</p>
    <p>Find­ing vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties in the ice shelves but­tress­ing the glaciers above was a sur­prise, Dr Lai said.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, we thought there are go­ing to be places vul­ner­a­ble to hy­drofrac­ture, but that those places might not mat­ter at all for the ice sheet,” Dr Lai said.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists fear that l os­ing i ce shelves to hy­drofrac­tur­ing will leave Antarc­tica’s ice sheets, which are as big as the United States and</p>
    <p>Mex­ico com­bined, a more di­rect path­way to the ocean. That could ac­cel­er­ate ice loss and con­trib­ute to sea-level rise.</p>
    <p>Dr Alexan­dra Isern, head of Antarc­tic stud­ies for the US Na­tional Science Foun­da­tion and who was not in­volved in the study, said that if “we start see­ing the col­lapse of some of this ice that is there like a wall hold­ing back ev­ery­thing be­hind it, it’s just go­ing to ac­cel­er­ate the pace of sea-level rise be­yond what we’re prob­a­bly pre­dict­ing right now”.</p>
