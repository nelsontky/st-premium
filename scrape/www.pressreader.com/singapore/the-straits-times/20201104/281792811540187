    <p>There were nine new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,029.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded two cases from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH), while there were no new com­mu­nity cases an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing seven new pa­tients had come from over­seas and had been placed on stay-home no­tices on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore. All of them did not have symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Among the seven im­ported cases, six tested pos­i­tive for the virus on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded a 42-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman who re­turned from the Philip­pines and a 20-year-old fe­male per­ma­nent res­i­dent who ar­rived from In­dia.</p>
    <p>Another pa­tient, a 26-yearold fe­male Bangladesh­i de­pen­dant’s pass holder, ar­rived from Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>Three im­ported pa­tients are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Of these, two are work pass hold­ers. One, a 49-year-old Ger­man man, ar­rived from Ger­many, while the other, a 30-year-old Indian na­tional, ar­rived from the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>A 33-year-old Bangladesh­i woman, who is hold­ing a work per­mit, ar­rived from Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>The last im­ported pa­tient, who tested pos­i­tive on Sun­day, is a spe­cial pass holder.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old Filipino man ar­rived from the Philip­pines to board a ship docked here as a crew mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Both pa­tients from the dor­mi­to­ries were de­tected through ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said the num­ber of new cases in the com</p>
    <p>mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one such case in the past week, who is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With 13 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,922 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 38 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 26 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
