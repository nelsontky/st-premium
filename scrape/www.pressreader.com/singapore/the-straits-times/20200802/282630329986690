    <p>It is hard to jus­tify the hefty price, given how in­ex­pen­sive the in­gre­di­ents of flour, tomato, cheese and basil are. And that’s just the ba­sic pie.</p>
    <p>That said, it’s a great pizza, with a crisp yet chewy crust that is de­li­cious on its own. It is also very light. So I can see why ev­ery ta­ble or­ders at least one.</p>
    <p>Ex­tra top­pings cost $5 each and you should get them.</p>
    <p>An­chovies are an ac­quired taste be­cause of their briny pun­gency. But if you are a fan, you will be bowled over by the va­ri­ety here. They are fat and have a moreish salti­ness that gives the pizza just the nudge it needs to­wards great­ness.</p>
    <p>The pep­per­oni is a must too. A tip from Mr Bay­doun is to get them served on the side so the slices stay crispy. They are also good to munch on if you have any left from the pizza.</p>
    <p>The rest of the top­pings – onions, sweet pep­pers and mushrooms – round out the flavours nicely.</p>
    <p>I tried a pizza with three top­pings and another with all five on sep­a­rate vis­its, and can at­test that the one with ev­ery­thing on it tastes bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Since it is a big splurge, you may as well go the whole hog and pay $80 for the works.</p>
