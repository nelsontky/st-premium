    <p>In 2001, when I was still at­tend­ing col­lege, colum­nist David Brooks wrote an es­say for The At­lantic called The Or­gan­i­sa­tion Kid, in which he spent a lot of time with young Ivy League stu­dents and came away struck by their ba­sic ex­is­ten­tial con­tent­ment. In­stead of cam­pus rebels, they were re­sume builders, ac­com­plish­ment col­lec­tors and ap­ple pol­ish­ers, dis­tin­guished by their seren­ity, their faux-adult pro­fes­sion­al­ism, their po­litesse.</p>
    <p>I thought at the time that Mr Brooks made my co­hort out to be more de­cent than we re­ally were. But he was en­tirely cor­rect that most of my peers be­lieved that mer­i­toc­racy was fair and just and worked – be­cause, after all, it seemed to work for us.</p>
    <p>I grad­u­ated the year after The Or­gan­i­sa­tion Kid ran and drifted to other in­ter­ests. As I fol­lowed the col­lege ad­mis­sions racket there­after, it seemed to be­come more com­pet­i­tive, more ruth­less.</p>
    <p>A few years ago, I moved back to the col­lege town where I grew up. Some of the striv­ing cul­ture that Mr Brooks de­scribed re­mains very much in place. But talk­ing to stu­dents and pro­fes­sors, the most strik­ing dif­fer­ence is the dis­ap­pear­ance of seren­ity, the evap­o­ra­tion of con­tent­ment, the spread of anx­i­ety and men­tal ill­ness – with the re­puted scale of an­tide­pres­sant use a par­tic­u­lar stark marker of this change.</p>
    <p>I don’t think this al­ter­ation just re­flects a dark­en­ing vi­sion of the wider world, a fear of cli­mate change or Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. It also re­flects a trans­for­ma­tion within the mer­i­toc­racy it­self – a sense in which, since 2001, the sys­tem has con­sis­tently been ask­ing more of lad­der climbers and de­liv­er­ing less as its re­ward.</p>
    <p>Scholar Peter Turchin of the Univer­sity of Con­necti­cut, whose work on the cy­cles of Amer­i­can his­tory may have pre­dicted this year’s un­rest, has a phrase that de­scribes part of this dy­namic: the</p>
    <p>“over­pro­duc­tion of elites”.</p>
    <p>In the con­text of col­lege ad­mis­sions, that means ex­actly what it sounds like: We’ve had a sur­plus of smart, young Amer­i­cans pur­su­ing ad­mis­sion to a nar­row list of elite col­leges whose en­rol­ment doesn’t ex­pand with pop­u­la­tion, even as for­eign stu­dents in­creas­ingly com­pete for the same stag­nant share of slots.</p>
    <p>Then, hav­ing run this gaunt­let, Amer­ica’s mer­i­to­crats grad­u­ate into a big-city ecosys­tem where the price of adult goods such as schools and hous­ing has been bid up dra­mat­i­cally, while im­por­tant cul­tural in­dus­tries – es­pe­cially academia and jour­nal­ism – sup­ply fewer jobs even dur­ing good eco­nomic times.</p>
    <p>And they live half in these crowded, over­com­pet­i­tive worlds and half on the In­ter­net, which has ex­tended the com­pe­ti­tion for sta­tus al­most in­fin­itely, weak­en­ing some of the nor­mal ways that lo­cal pres­tige might com­pen­sate for dis­ap­point­ing in­come.</p>
    <p>These stresses have ex­posed the thin­ness of mer­i­toc­racy as a cul­ture, a Hog­warts with SATs in­stead of magic, a sec­u­lar sub­sti­tute for older forms of com­mu­nity, tra­di­tion or re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, it was the fre­quent boast of Obama-era lib­er­al­ism that it had re­stored cer­tain bour­geois virtues – de­layed child­bear­ing, sta­ble mar­riages – with­out re­quir­ing any­thing so anachro­nis­tic as Chris­tian­ity or courtship rit­u­als. But if your bour­geois or­der is built on a cy­cle of com­pe­ti­tion and re­ward, and the com­pe­ti­tion gets fiercer while the re­wards di­min­ish, then in­stead of young peo­ple hook­ing up safely on the way to a lu­cra­tive job and a dual-in­come mar­riage with 2.1 kids, you’ll get young peo­ple set adrift, un­able to pair off, post­pon­ing mar­riage per­ma­nently while they wait for a sta­bil­ity that never comes.</p>
    <p>This brings us to the sub­ject of the in­creas­ing ap­peal, to these un­happy young peo­ple and to their par­ents and ed­u­ca­tors as well, of an emer­gent ide­ol­ogy that ac­cuses many of them of em­body­ing white priv­i­lege, and of be­ing “frag­ile”, in the words of the now-fa­mous anti-racism con­sul­tant Robin DiAn­gelo, if they ob­ject or dis­agree.</p>
    <p>Part of this ide­ol­ogy’s ap­peal is clearly about mean­ing and moral­ity: The new anti-racism has a con­fes­sional, re­li­gious en­ergy that the sec­u­lar mer­i­toc­racy has al­ways lacked.</p>
    <p>But there is also some­thing im­por­tant about its more rad­i­cal and even ridicu­lous el­e­ments – like the weird busi­ness that in­creas­ingly shows up in of­fi­cial doc­u­ments, from the New York Pub­lic Schools or the Smith­so­nian, de­scrib­ing things like “per­fec­tion­ism” or “wor­ship of the writ­ten word” or “em­pha­sis on the sci­en­tific method” or “de­layed grat­i­fi­ca­tion” as fea­tures of a toxic white­ness.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine your­self as a rel­a­tively priv­i­leged white per­son ex­hausted by mer­i­toc­racy – an over­worked stu­dent or a fret­ful par­ent or a school ad­min­is­tra­tor con­stantly be­sieged by both.</p>
    <p>Wouldn’t it come as a re­lief, in some way, if it turned out that the whole “ex­haust­ing Alice In Won­der­land Red Queen Race of full-time mer­i­to­cratic achieve­ment”, in the words of a pseudony­mous critic, was noth­ing more than a man­i­fes­ta­tion of the very white supremacy that good lib­er­als are obliged to dis­man­tle and op­pose?</p>
    <p>If all the test­ing, all the “de­layed grat­i­fi­ca­tion” and “per­fec­tion­ism”, was just a form of racism, and in eas­ing up, you can im­prove your life and your child’s life and, hap­pily, strike an anti-racist blow as well? And wouldn’t it be es­pe­cially ap­peal­ing if – and here, I’m afraid I’m go­ing to be very cyn­i­cal – in the course of re­lax­ing the de­mands of white­ness you could, just co­in­ci­den­tally, make your fam­ily’s po­si­tion a lit­tle bit more se­cure?</p>
    <p>For in­stance: Once you dis­miss the SAT as just a tool of white supremacy, then it gets eas­ier for elite schools to jus­tify ex­clud­ing the Asian Amer­i­can stu­dents whose stan­dard­ised-test scores keep climb­ing while white scores stay rel­a­tively flat. Or, if you in­duce in­ner-city char­ter schools to dis­avow their pre­vi­ous em­pha­sis on hard work and dis­ci­pline and mer­i­to­cratic am­bi­tion, be­cause those are racist, too – well, then their mi­nor­ity grad­u­ates might be­come less com­pet­i­tive with your own kids in the col­lege ad­mis­sions race as well.</p>
    <p>Not that any­one is con­sciously think­ing like this. What I’m de­scrib­ing is a sub­tle and sub­con­scious cur­rent, deep down in the pro­gres­sive stream. But deep cur­rents can run strong.</p>
    <p>And if the avowed in­ten­tion of the mo­ment is to chal­lenge “white fragility” and yet lots of white peo­ple seem strangely en­thu­si­as­tic about the chal­lenge, it is worth con­sid­er­ing that maybe a dif­fer­ent kind of fragility is in play: the stress and un­hap­pi­ness felt by mer­i­toc­racy’s strivers, who may be open to a rev­o­lu­tion that seems to prom­ise more sta­bil­ity and less ex­haus­tion, and asks them only to de­nounce the “white­ness” of a sys­tem that has made even its most suc­cess­ful par­tic­i­pants feel frag­ile and ex­is­ten­tially de­pressed.</p>
