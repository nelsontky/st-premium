    <p>LILONGWE (Malawi) • A pop­u­lar snack when food is boun­ti­ful, mice have be­come a vi­tal source of pro­tein in Malawi since the coron­avirus pan­demic ag­gra­vated food short­ages and eco­nomic hard­ship.</p>
    <p>Ven­dors wav­ing long skew­ers of roasted field mice typ­i­cally stand along Malawi’s main high­way, tar­get­ing mo­torists trav­el­ling be­tween the two largest cities, Blan­tyre and Lilongwe.</p>
    <p>Sea­soned and cooked to a crisp, mice are also sold at street stalls and mar­kets across the south-east African coun­try.</p>
    <p>But these salty road­side bites also come in handy when times get tough.</p>
    <p>Mal­nu­tri­tion and food in­se­cu­rity are peren­nial is­sues in the small, land­locked na­tion, where more than half of the pop­u­la­tion live be­low the poverty line.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic, which has i nfected nearly 5,500 peo­ple and killed more than 170, has only ex­ac­er­bated f ood short­ages as many liveli­hoods have been cur­tailed by con­fine­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>For mice hunter Bernard Simeon, from Malawi’s cen­tral Ntcheu dis­trict, the pan­demic has brought new com­plex­i­ties to his pover­tys­tricken life. “We were al­ready strug­gling be­fore the coron­avirus,” he said shortly af­ter pre­par­ing his daily mice catch. “But now be­cause of the dis­ease, things have re­ally gone bad.”</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old is pri­mar­ily a farmer, but he also hunts and hawks mice to sup­ple­ment his liveli­hood. His wife Yankho Chalera and their child de­pend on his earn­ings.</p>
    <p>“When times are hard, we rely on mice to sup­ple­ment our diet be­cause we can­not af­ford to buy meat,” said Ms Chalera, wash­ing dishes af­ter lunch.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal­ists, how­ever, have voiced con­cern about dam­age caused by mouse-hunt­ing meth­ods as de­mand in­creases.</p>
    <p>The ro­dents are typ­i­cally found in corn fields, where they grow plump on grains, fruit, grass and the odd in­sect. Af­ter crops are har­vested, hunters burn bushes to iden­tify mice holes so they can trap them.</p>
    <p>“In so do­ing, they de­stroy a lot of the ecosys­tem within the bush,” said Mr Dun­can Maph­we­sesa, di­rec­tor of the en­vi­ron­men­tal rights group Azi­tona Devel­op­ment Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“Much as we ap­pre­ci­ate that they have to sus­tain a liveli­hood due to poverty, the bush­fire is­sue is a longterm de­struc­tion,” he said. “They don’t see that they are af­fect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment and that they are part and par­cel of those who are caus­ing cli­mate change.”</p>
    <p>But tra­di­tion is hard to break. Fifty-year-old mu­si­cian Lu­cius Banda rem­i­nisces about mouse­hunt­ing ad­ven­tures dur­ing his youth in ru­ral Balaka.</p>
    <p>“As a vil­lage boy, you learn how to hunt mice from as early as three years old,” said Mr Banda, a for­mer two-time par­lia­men­tar­ian for the dis­trict. “And in the vil­lage, this is not viewed as a task, but more as a form of en­ter­tain­ment that is en­joyed by both boys and girls.”</p>
