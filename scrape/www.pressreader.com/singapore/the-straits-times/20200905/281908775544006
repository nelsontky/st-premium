    <p>China is al­ready fac­ing a grow­ing num­ber of diplo­matic bat­tles, not least with the world’s big­gest su­per­power, but that has not stopped Bei­jing from wag­ing one against Aus­tralia us­ing the force of its eco­nomic might.</p>
    <p>It has slapped an 80 per cent tar­iff on Aus­tralian bar­ley, banned some of its beef im­ports and, more re­cently, launched an anti-dump­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Aus­tralian wine.</p>
    <p>Last month, it also de­tained a high-pro­file Aus­tralian news an­chor work­ing for Chi­nese state broad­caster CGTN, el­e­vat­ing fears that it was also en­gag­ing in “hostage diplo­macy” and prompt­ing com­par­isons to the ar­rests of two Cana­dian cit­i­zens in De­cem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Cana­di­ans Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were charged with es­pi­onage, but their in­car­cer­a­tions are widely seen as a re­tal­i­a­tion against Canada’s de­ten­tion of Huawei ex­ec­u­tive Meng Wanzhou.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has not brought charges against Ms Cheng Lei, the CGTN news an­chor, and it is un­clear why she is be­ing held in a se­cret lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing claimed to have no in­for­ma­tion, but took the op­por­tu­nity to re­mind the Aus­tralians that while Bei­jing val­ues its bi­lat­eral ties with Can­berra, the re­la­tion­ship “needs both sides to work to­gether”.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries took a nose­dive in April af­ter the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment called for an in­de­pen­dent in­quiry into the ori­gin of the coro­n­avirus out­break. That an­gered China, whose state me­dia quickly got to work slam­ming Aus­tralia as “gum stuck to the bot­tom of China’s shoe” and a lackey of the United States.</p>
    <p>Threats of eco­nomic re­tal­i­a­tion fol­lowed swiftly, with the Chi­nese Am­bas­sador in Can­berra Cheng Jingye’s thinly veiled threat of boy­cotting Aus­tralian goods taken right out of his coun­try’s play­book when dis­pens­ing pun­ish­ment to of­fend­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“Maybe the or­di­nary peo­ple will say, ‘Why should we drink</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian wine? Eat Aus­tralian beef?’” he told the Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view in late April.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter, Aus­tralian bar­ley farm­ers found them­selves hit by 80 per cent tar­iffs from China, their big­gest cus­tomer re­spon­si­ble for buying more than half of all their ex­ports, worth up to</p>
    <p>A$2 bil­lion (S$1.98 bil­lion) a year.</p>
    <p>China also sus­pended beef im­ports from four of Aus­tralia’s largest com­pa­nies and said it was look­ing into ac­cu­sa­tions that Aus­tralian ex­porters have been sell­ing wine in that mar­ket for less than it cost to pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Like bar­ley, Aus­tralia’s beef and wine ex­ports are pri­mar­ily des­tined for China’s im­mense mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in bi­lat­eral re­la­tions did not just hap­pen, but can be traced back to 2017 when Aus­tralia ac­cused Bei­jing of med­dling in its do­mes­tic af­fairs, and pushed a new anti-for­eign in­ter­fer­ence law through in a bid to counter China.</p>
    <p>Be­ing one of the first coun­tries to bar Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment gi­ant Huawei from its na­tional 5G roll-out also put Aus­tralia in China’s bad books.</p>
    <p>Can­berra has, much to Bei­jing’s an­noy­ance, also been rou­tinely pip­ing up about what China views as its core in­ter­ests, such as the South China Sea and Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>But both sides have, un­til this year, had the “com­mon sense” to keep pol­i­tics out of a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship, said Pro­fes­sor James Lau­rence­son, direc­tor of the Aus­tralia-China Re­la­tions In­sti­tute at the Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>“This year, that fire­wall be­tween pol­i­tics and eco­nomics has in­creas­ingly shown signs of break­ing down. This is deeply un­for­tu­nate be­cause it was the eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship that pro­vided bal­last amid the ten­sions. And with­out it, there is the po­ten­tial for an ever-faster down­ward spi­ral,” he said.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries have, over the years, en­joyed the fruits of a lu­cra­tive free trade agree­ment, signed af­ter Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s state visit at the end of 2014.</p>
    <p>China is Aus­tralia’s largest trad­ing part­ner, with two-way trade worth A$235 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>While China is able to find al­ter­na­tive sources for bar­ley, beef and wine, it re­lies on Aus­tralia for a steady sup­ply of iron ore for steel, to build in­fra­struc­ture post-Covid-19, and has not tar­geted this pre­cious com­mod­ity in its trade sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Nearly 90 per cent of Aus­tralia’s iron ore ex­ports are bound for China. But the hurt of be­ing “sin­gled out” for a probe over the coro­n­avirus trail runs deep.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, China’s deputy head of mis­sion in Aus­tralia Wang Xin­ing told an au­di­ence at the Na­tional Press Club in Can­berra: “Fi­nally our peo­ple back in China thought they were able to take a breath be­cause they were un­der huge pres­sure – in the first three months, they sac­ri­ficed a lot... All of a sud­den, there was this shock­ing pro­posal from Aus­tralia, sup­posed to be a good friend of China.”</p>
    <p>With Aus­tralia ex­pected soon to pass leg­is­la­tion that could pre­vent its states from tak­ing part in</p>
    <p>China’s sig­na­ture Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, ten­sions risk run­ning even deeper.</p>
    <p>Prof Lau­rence­son said the trend of bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ships get­ting caught up in do­mes­tic pol­i­tics was wor­ry­ing.</p>
    <p>“In essence, nei­ther gov­ern­ment will be re­warded by do­mes­tic au­di­ences for ap­pear­ing weak, and so there is an in­cen­tive to be ‘tough’. That may serve a do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal ob­jec­tive but it in­creas­ingly alien­ates the other side.”</p>
