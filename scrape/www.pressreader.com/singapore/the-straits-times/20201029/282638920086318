    <p>CANNES (France) • Movie lovers got a turn on the red car­pet at Cannes on Tues­day night as the or­gan­is­ers of its famed cinema fes­ti­val, can­celled ear­lier this year due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, kicked off a more low-key three-day event show­cas­ing a range of short films.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally awash with Hol­ly­wood stars who flock to the French city’s “Croisette” prom­e­nade for the twoweek ex­trav­a­ganza in May, Cannes was a much qui­eter ver­sion of its glam­orous self, with even some ma­jor ho­tels de­cid­ing to shut.</p>
    <p>But or­gan­is­ers said they had wanted to hold an event all the same, de­spite en­dur­ing travel re­stric­tions, to shine a light on some films and give a boost to the cinema in­dus­try, hit hard by coro­n­avirus lock­downs.</p>
    <p>“It’s a re­union of friends,” said Cannes Film Fes­ti­val pres­i­dent Pierre Les­cure.</p>
    <p>The event on France’s southern coast is the world’s big­gest cinema show­case and also a ma­jor mar­ket for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic were in­vited to reg­is­ter for tick­ets.</p>
    <p>Four films that would have been part of the of­fi­cial main com­pe­ti­tion in May will be shown, while sev­eral short movies will com­pete for a prize.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing face masks, and long gowns in some cases, guests wound their way up a red car­pet to one of the au­di­to­ri­ums.</p>
    <p>Mr Les­cure said Cannes’ or­gan­is­ers were al­ready think­ing of op­tions to move the fes­ti­val dates next year if it could not take place as usual in May.</p>
    <p>“We have al­ready planned one or two pos­si­ble dates that have been pushed back to June or July. But Cannes 2021 will hap­pen,” he said.</p>
