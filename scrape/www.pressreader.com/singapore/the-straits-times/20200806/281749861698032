    <p>United States Sec­re­tary of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Alex Azar will be ar­riv­ing in Tai­wan on an up­com­ing visit and speak­ing with Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen as well as med­i­cal ex­perts on Tai­wan’s fight against Covid-19, said Tai­wan’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar will be the first US Cab­i­net of­fi­cial to visit Tai­wan since then ad­min­is­tra­tor of the En­vi­ron­men­tal Pro­tec­tion Agency Gina Mc</p>
    <p>Carthy vis­ited Tai­wan un­der Pres­i­dent Barack Obama in 2014. How­ever, Mr Azar is the high­est-rank­ing Cab­i­net mem­ber to visit Tai­wan since Tai­wan and the US cut for­mal ties in 1979.</p>
    <p>The visit comes at a time when US-China ties are at an all-time low. US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo vowed on Tues­day to pro­tect Hong Kong’s pro-democ­racy ac­tivists and cam­paign­ers who have left Hong Kong fear­ing for their per­sonal safety.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party can­not tol­er­ate the free think­ing of its own peo­ple, and in­creas­ingly is try­ing to ex­tend its reach out­side</p>
    <p>China’s bor­ders,” Mr Pom­peo said in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>His re­marks came af­ter Chi­nese state me­dia re­ported last Fri­day that Hong Kong po­lice had ordered the ar­rest of six pro-democ­racy ac­tivists liv­ing in ex­ile abroad. The six are sus­pected to have vi­o­lated the newly im­ple­mented na­tional se­cu­rity law that gives Bei­jing un­prece­dented power over Hong Kong and its peo­ple.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the visit, in­clud­ing the ex­act dates and an of­fi­cial itin­er­ary, have not been re­leased yet, but the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties have al­ready spo­ken up in dis­ap­proval of Mr Azar’s plans.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin said in a reg­u­lar press brief­ing in Bei­jing that “China firmly op­poses of­fi­cial ex­changes be­tween the United States and Tai­wan”.</p>
    <p>“China has made solemn rep­re­sen­ta­tions to the United States in Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton re­spec­tively,” said Mr Wang, not­ing that Tai­wan was the “most im­por­tant and most sen­si­tive is­sue in Sino-US re­la­tions”. He called for the US to keep to the one-China prin­ci­ple and re­frain from send­ing any “wrong sig­nals” to Tai­wan’s proin­de­pen­dence forces in or­der not to dam­age US-China re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to Ms Tsai, Mr Azar will also be meet­ing For­eign Min­is­ter Joseph Wu and Health and Wel­fare Min­is­ter Chen Shih-chung, as well as med­i­cal ex­perts and front­line med­i­cal work­ers han­dling Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Cab­i­net spokesman Ko­las Yo­taka said Tai­wan wel­comed Mr Azar’s visit and said it was “a tes­ta­ment to the friendly ties be­tween Tai­wan and the United States”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s top en­voy to Wash­ing­ton Cui Tiankai said on Wed­nes­day that Bei­jing did not want to see a Cold War break out be­tween China and the US, and that the two coun­tries’ re­la­tions are suf­fer­ing un­prece­dented strain, some­thing both sides should work to­gether to rem­edy. “I don’t think a new Cold War would serve any­body’s in­ter­est,” said Mr Cui.</p>
    <p>Other US Cab­i­net of­fi­cials to have vis­ited Tai­wan in­clude former sec­re­tary of trans­porta­tion Fed­erico F. Pena in 1994, former sec­re­tary of en­ergy Bill Richard­son in 1998 and former sec­re­tary of trans­porta­tion Rod­ney Slater in 2000.</p>
