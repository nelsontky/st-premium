    <p>Freight lor­ries parked at Manston Air­port in south-east Eng­land, wait­ing to de­part Bri­tain, on Tues­day. Thou­sands of trucks were stranded from a par­tial block­ade by France aimed at con­tain­ing a highly in­fec­tious coro­n­avirus vari­ant, caus­ing irate driv­ers to briefly scuffle with Bri­tish po­lice yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>DOVER • Lorry driv­ers scuf­fled with the po­lice and sounded their horns in protest around the English port of Dover as a par­tial block­ade by France de­signed to con­tain a highly in­fec­tious coro­n­avirus vari­ant an­gered thou­sands stranded be­fore Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Paris and Lon­don agreed late on Tues­day that driv­ers car­ry­ing a neg­a­tive test re­sult could board fer­ries for Calais from yes­ter­day af­ter much of the world shut its bor­ders to Bri­tain to con­tain the new mu­tated vari­ant.</p>
    <p>A Bri­tish min­is­ter said the mil­i­tary would start test­ing driv­ers but he warned that it would take time to clear the back­log, ham­mer­ing Bri­tain’s most i mpor­tant trade route for food just days be­fore it leaves the Euro­pean Union’s or­bit.</p>
    <p>Long queues of lor­ries have been stacked on a mo­tor­way to­wards the Euro­tun­nel and Dover in the south-east county of Kent, while oth­ers have been parked on the for­mer nearby air­port at Manston.</p>
    <p>“They don’t give us food, they don’t give us drinks, they don’t give us san­i­ta­tion, they don’t of­fer us any­thing,” said Span­ish lorry driver Ser­gio Robles, 41.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s re­tail in­dus­try lobby group warned that prob­lems could crop up with the avail­abil­ity of some fresh goods.</p>
    <p>“Un­til the back­log is cleared and sup­ply chains re­turn to nor­mal, we an­tic­i­pate is­sues with the avail­abil­ity of some fresh goods,” said Mr An­drew Opie, di­rec­tor of food and sus­tain­abil­ity at the Bri­tish Re­tail Con­sor­tium.</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion footage showed lorry driv­ers honk­ing their horns and flash­ing lights in uni­son to protest.</p>
    <p>As tem­pers flared in Dover, there were brief scuf­fles between driv­ers – an­gered that they will not be able to get home to their fam­i­lies be­fore Christ­mas – and a small num­ber of po­lice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The Road Haulage As­so­ci­a­tion (RHA), which es­ti­mated there were up to 10,000 lor­ries held up in Kent, said the sit­u­a­tion was chaotic as the test­ing sys­tem was not yet ready.</p>
    <p>“What we’ve got this morn­ing are very an­gry truck­ers in Dover,” Mr Rod McKen­zie, manag­ing di­rec­tor of pol­icy for the RHA, told BBC TV. “They’re tired, frus­trated and des­per­ately want to get home for Christ­mas.”</p>
    <p>Nor­mally, between 7,500 and 8,500 lor­ries travel via the port ev­ery day but vol­umes have reached more than 10,000 re­cently.</p>
    <p>Some of the ex­tra traffic was a re­sult of Christ­mas de­mand, but many were in the coun­try to de­liver goods to com­pa­nies which are stock­pil­ing parts be­fore Bri­tain fi­nally leaves the EU on Dec 31, a move that is ex­pected to cause fur­ther dis­rup­tion next month when a full Cus­toms bor­der comes into force.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­tics firms have also warned that many Euro­pean driv­ers have al­ready re­fused to go to Bri­tain in the new year when they will have to carry Cus­toms pa­per­work, and that the need to se­cure a Covid-19 test will fur­ther com­pound the sit­u­a­tion, push­ing up freight prices.</p>
    <p>TIRED AND FRUS­TRATED They don’t give us food, they don’t give us drinks, they don’t give us san­i­ta­tion, they don’t of­fer us any­thing. LORRY DRIVER SER­GIO ROBLES</p>
