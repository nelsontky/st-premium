    <p>JAYA • Malaysia’s Works Min­istry has pledged to fix pot­holes on fed­eral roads within 24 hours of receiving a complaint, as the is­sue of road main­te­nance con­tin­ues to be par­o­died.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that un­der its zero pot­holes cam­paign, the patch­ing of pot­holes or tem­po­rary re­pairs on fed­eral roads will be con­ducted within 24 hours, while per­ma­nent re­pairs will be done in three days as per the Fed­eral Road Main­te­nance con­tract.</p>
    <p>The min­istry’s re­sponse fol­lowed back­lash against the gov­ern­ment for al­leged dou­ble stan­dards in deal­ing with a Cabi­net min­is­ter and the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Hours af­ter Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Min­is­ter Khairy Ja­malud­din shared on Twit­ter on Sun­day how he fell af­ter en­coun­ter­ing an un­even patch of road while rid­ing his bi­cy­cle in Bant­ing, Se­lan­gor, the Pub­lic Works Depart­ment (JKR) swiftly apol­o­gised to Mr Khairy on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment fixed the patch of road within 24 hours of the ac­ci­dent, rais­ing pub­lic ire that many pot­holes were not fixed as quickly de­spite many com­plaints.</p>
    <p>The Works Min­istry said in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day that the cam­paign, which pre­vi­ously ran from 2016 to 2018, was rein­tro­duced in July last year.</p>
    <p>It said this was an ini­tia­tive of the min­istry with JKR and six con­ces­sion­aires for fed­eral road main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>“Pot­holes re­fer to holes with widths from be­low 200mm up to 1,000mm. If the width of the hole is be­low 200mm, it does not in­volve any cut­ting, and will be patched.</p>
    <p>“When the width of the hole is up to 1,000mm, it will re­quire the part of the road to be cut be­fore it is patched,” the min­istry said, adding that holes with a width of over 1,000mm will be treated as “pave­ment fail­ure”.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that through Bud­get 2021, the gov­ern­ment had al­lo­cated RM100 mil­lion (S$32.8 mil­lion) for the im­ple­men­ta­tion of “weight in mo­tion” de­vices on iden­ti­fied fed­eral roads.</p>
    <p>It said that it took the safety of road users se­ri­ously, adding that the road net­work in Malaysia is 254,477.6km long.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also said that the gov­ern­ment had de­tected and fixed al­most 200,000 pot­holes on roads last year.</p>
    <p>The patch­ing of pot­holes or tem­po­rary re­pairs on fed­eral roads will be con­ducted within 24 hours, while per­ma­nent re­pairs will be done in three days as per the Fed­eral Road Main­te­nance con­tract.</p>
