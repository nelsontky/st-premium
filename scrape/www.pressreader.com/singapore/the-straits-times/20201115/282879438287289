    <p>Eng­land man­ager Gareth South­gate said he is not sur­prised by the num­ber of chances Harry Kane has cre­ated for Tot­ten­ham this sea­son, adding that his pass­ing abil­ity has al­ways been as good as his fin­ish­ing.</p>
    <p>The striker has scored seven goals and pro­vided eight as­sists in eight Pre­mier League matches for Spurs this cam­paign, and South­gate said that he was de­lighted to have the 27-year-old fir­ing on all cylin­ders ahead of to­day’s Na­tions League clash in Bel­gium.</p>
    <p>“I know there seems to be more em­pha­sis or more spot­light on that part of his game now, but he’s def­i­nitely al­ways had it,” he said. “He’s as good a provider and as good a passer as he is a fin­isher and he is, of course, an out­stand­ing fin­isher.</p>
    <p>“Clearly the com­bi­na­tions at club level with Son (He­ung-min), in par­tic­u­lar (are im­pres­sive). When you’ve got run­ners go­ing be­yond him, he’ll find the passes. So we’re priv­i­leged to have him... it’s great to see him hit­ting that sort of form.”</p>
    <p>Kane was an un­used sub­sti­tute in Thurs­day’s 3-0 friendly win over Ire­land but is set to earn his 50th cap against Bel­gium, who are top of their Na­tions League League A Group 2 and two points ahead of Eng­land (seven).</p>
    <p>“I’m hop­ing he does get that 50th cap... be­cause it would mean we would have got through an­other cou­ple of days with­out los­ing an­other player,” added South­gate, who is with­out Mar­cus Rash­ford and Joe Gomez due to in­juries.</p>
    <p>“Harry’s scor­ing record for us is phe­nom­e­nal. You al­ways know, go­ing into a game with the likes of him and Ra­heem (Ster­ling), that we’ve got tremen­dous goal threat.”</p>
    <p>The Eng­land boss has also in­di­cated Jack Gre­al­ish could be in line for his first com­pet­i­tive full in­ter­na­tional start after the As­ton Villa cap­tain im­pressed against Ire­land.</p>
    <p>Gre­al­ish starred in an at­tack­ing role on the left flank dur­ing the win and set up Jadon San­cho for ar­guably the best goal of the game.</p>
    <p>South­gate sub­sti­tuted Gre­al­ish after an hour, along with club col­league Ty­rone Mings, and said he had done so with a view to the team’s up­com­ing fix­tures.</p>
    <p>“The two boys both played Sun­day as well and we have got an eye on the next two matches,” he said, with the Three Lions tak­ing on Ice­land at Wem­b­ley on Wed­nes­day after the Bel­gium game.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, San­cho ad­mit­ted his form has dipped slightly this sea­son but dis­missed sug­ges­tions that it is due to me­dia spec­u­la­tion about his club fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The Borus­sia Dort­mund for­ward has yet to find the net in six league games this sea­son after scor­ing 17 in the pre­vi­ous cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Asked if the spec­u­la­tion had af­fected his form, San­cho told ITV: “No I don’t think so. I feel like ev­ery player has a lit­tle dip in their ca­reer and I’m go­ing through that.”</p>
