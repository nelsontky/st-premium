    <p>The of­fer­ings dur­ing fash­ion weeks have al­ways been in­spired by – and, more of­ten than not, re­flect – cur­rent af­fairs and this sea­son was es­pe­cially poignant.</p>
    <p>France’s daily coro­n­avirus cases con­tin­ued to rise to an all-time high of more than 15,000 a day as its cap­i­tal pre­pared for the first Paris Fash­ion Week post-lock­down for spring/sum­mer 2021.</p>
    <p>With so­cial dis­tanc­ing as the new nor­mal, brands ex­per­i­mented with new ways of pre­sent­ing their col­lec­tions.</p>
    <p>For some, guest ca­pac­i­ties were limited so phys­i­cal shows could go on. Else­where, ex­trav­a­gant films were pro­duced for dig­i­tal con­sump­tion only. Then there were the “phy­gi­tal” shows which were put to the test.</p>
    <p>Some brands de­cided to pull out of the of­fi­cial fash­ion cal­en­dar in favour of a dif­fer­ent pace.</p>
    <p>Amid all this un­cer­tainty, many ques­tioned whether Paris Fash­ion Week, which ran from Sept 28 to Oct 6, should go ahead.</p>
    <p>Here are 10 mo­ments that re­minded peo­ple that fash­ion week is still as rel­e­vant as ever.</p>
    <p>For Loewe (right), Jonathan An­der­son took the lim­i­ta­tions of the pan­demic as a chal­lenge that sparked in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>There was no run­way show, but he wanted to get the au­di­ence in­volved in a new way.</p>
    <p>In­stead of a sim­ple in­vi­ta­tion, guests re­ceived an artist’s port­fo­lio that con­tained life-size posters of the col­lec­tion, as well as rolls of wall­pa­per, scis­sors and paint brushes, among other things. They were en­cour­aged to be­come cre­ators them­selves and make their own “show on the wall”.</p>
