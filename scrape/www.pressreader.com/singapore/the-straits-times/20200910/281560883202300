    <p>So­cial run­ner and spec­ta­tor Kelvin Ling said in court yes­ter­day that he was con­fused why Mr Ash­ley Liew slowed down dur­ing the 2015 SEA Games marathon shortly af­ter mak­ing a U-turn and won­dered if he was in­jured. He is a plain­tiff’s wit­ness for Mr Liew, who is su­ing fel­low Sin­ga­pore marathoner Soh Rui Yong for defama­tion over the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Recre­ational run­ner Kelvin Ling, who was a spec­ta­tor at East Coast Park dur­ing the 2015 SEA Games marathon fi­nal, said in court yes­ter­day that he saw marathoner Ash­ley Liew “was al­most sta­tion­ary and the turnover of his legs was very slow” af­ter the U-turn in­ci­dent had oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Ling, who is the plain­tiff’s wit­ness in Liew’s defama­tion suit against for­mer team­mate Soh Rui Yong, was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from Soh’s lawyer, Clarence Lun.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Ling had said Liew was 50m to 80m from him and that there was a sig­nif­i­cant dis­tinc­tion be­tween the two dis­tances, Lun asked if he was able to re­ally ob­serve that Liew was “run­ning at a pace slower than be­fore”.</p>
    <p>On the morn­ing of the in­ci­dent, Ling re­called that race of­fi­cials had been set­ting up cones when he had ar­rived at about 6am, and noted that they were “not very vis­i­ble com­pared to the other races I’ve par­tic­i­pated in”.</p>
    <p>Lun asked: “When you com­mu­ni­cated the po­ten­tial is­sues to the of­fi­cials, what did they do?” Ling replied that “we were told to keep quiet be­cause the run­ners had been briefed of their route”.</p>
    <p>Ling said that Soh had been in the first group of run­ners ap­proach­ing him, and Liew was in the sec­ond group. He said he saw Liew make the turn at the U-turn point, af­ter which the lat­ter “ac­cel­er­ated and just went on at a nor­mal pace”.</p>
    <p>Lun later re­ferred to Ling’s af­fi­davit in which he said that Liew was run­ning at a pace “much slower than be­fore” and with “sig­nif­i­cantly re­duced ca­dence”, and asked Ling to elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>He replied: “(For) ca­dence I’m talk­ing about how fast he’s turn­ing over his legs. From my point of view, the turnover wasn’t that fast and it was as if he’s just bounc­ing up and down and not mov­ing away from me.”</p>
    <p>Soh’s lawyer then asked if Ling’s vis­i­bil­ity would have been af­fected by dark­ness (at the race lo­ca­tion) and con­fu­sion over the events that had un­folded be­fore him.</p>
    <p>“What I saw was the plain­tiff slow­ing down with re­duced turnover. My state of mind, I can­not re­call,” replied Ling.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Ling had said in his af­fi­davit that he was con­fused, Lun asked what he was con­fused about.</p>
    <p>“I was con­fused be­cause Ash­ley seemed like he was slow­ing down from his re­duced ca­dence... a thought just came to me that he might be in­jured,” said the wit­ness.</p>
    <p>This U-turn in­ci­dent at the SEA Games marathon was what sparked the dis­pute be­tween Soh and Liew in Oc­to­ber 2018, when the for­mer, in a Face­book post, ac­cused Liew of ly­ing about the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Liew said he had slowed down to al­low other run­ners to catch up af­ter they missed the U-turn and took the wrong path.</p>
    <p>Back on the stand in the af­ter­noon, Liew said he was “caught by sur­prise be­cause there was no an­i­mos­ity be­tween us at that point”. He was re­spond­ing to Lun’s ques­tion on whether Soh’s com­ment (in Oc­to­ber 2018) was made in re­ac­tion to the In­ter­na­tional Fair Play Com­mit­tee’s (IFPC) so­cial me­dia post on Oct 13, 2018. The IFPC had awarded Liew the Pierre de Cou­bertin World Fair Play Tro­phy in Septem­ber 2016 for his ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Lun said: “I put it to you there’s only one rea­son – my client’s con­science was pricked... there needs to be his side of the story of what hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>Liew, who is rep­re­sented by Mark Teng of That.Le­gal LLC, replied: “I can­not speak for his con­science be­ing pricked.”</p>
    <p>The sixth day of the civil suit con­tin­ues to­day, with the fourth and fi­nal plain­tiff’s wit­ness, Quek Chiu Lian, to take the stand. Soh is ex­pected to tes­tify to­mor­row.</p>
