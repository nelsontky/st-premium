    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Top aides to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump have said they agreed in prin­ci­ple with Se­nate Repub­li­cans on a US$1 tril­lion (S$1.4 tril­lion) coro­n­avirus relief pack­age – the party’s open­ing of­fer in ne­go­ti­a­tions with Democrats less than a week be­fore en­hanced un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits ex­pire.</p>
    <p>Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steve Mnuchin on Sun­day said the pack­age will con­tain ex­tended un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits that aim to re­place 70 per cent of a laid-off worker’s pre­vi­ous wages.</p>
    <p>“We’re done,” he told re­porters as he left the Capi­tol. He said some lan­guage was be­ing checked, but there were “no out­stand­ing is­sues”.</p>
    <p>Mr Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Mead­ows would not give de­tails, but the US$1 tril­lion of­fer was ex­pected to in­clude an­other round of di­rect pay­ments to in­di­vid­u­als, a re­duced fed­eral sup­ple­ment to un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits and li­a­bil­ity pro­tec­tions against coro­n­avirus-re­lated law­suits.</p>
    <p>An ex­tra US$600 per week in fed­eral job­less ben­e­fits, which economists say has propped up con­sumer spend­ing and al­lowed laid-off work­ers to pay rent and mort­gages, is due to ex­pire on Friday.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits were part of US$3.7 tril­lion in aid ap­proved in March as the na­tion’s econ­omy shut down. How­ever, wide­spread busi­ness re­open­ings have been thwarted as the virus surges in var­i­ous states, in­clud­ing Cal­i­for­nia and Flor­ida, which over­took New York, an early hot spot, in to­tal cases on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>More than 149,000 Amer­i­cans have died of Covid-19 – nearly a quar­ter of the global to­tal – and there are over 4.3 mil­lion con­firmed cases in the coun­try, a rate of one in­fec­tion in 79 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Be­fore go­ing to Capi­tol Hill on Sun­day, Mr Mnuchin and Mr Mead­ows had floated the idea of a piece­meal ap­proach to the next round of relief, ad­dress­ing ex­pir­ing items and leav­ing other is­sues to be tack­led later. Mr Mnuchin told Fox News that the two most press­ing is­sues were the ex­pir­ing un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits, and shield­ing busi­nesses, schools and uni­ver­si­ties from law­suits.</p>
    <p>House Democrats passed their own US$3 tril­lion relief Bill in May, which would keep the US$600-aweek sup­ple­ment in place un­til the end of this year.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Demo­crat in Congress, has crit­i­cised Repub­li­cans for not be­ing able to agree on a plan when Amer­i­cans are “on the brink” and go­ing hun­gry. “They’re in dis­ar­ray and that delay is caus­ing suf­fer­ing for Amer­ica’s fam­i­lies,” she told CBS’ Face The Na­tion.</p>
    <p>White House eco­nomic ad­viser Larry Kud­low said Amer­i­cans will re­ceive a US$1,200 cheque as part of the new pack­age, along with tax cred­its for small busi­nesses and restau­rants. Mr Kud­low told CNN’s State Of The Union that the pack­age would also ex­tend a fed­eral mora­to­rium of evic­tions con­tained in pre­vi­ous relief leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Democrats pre­fer a flat amount of en­hanced ben­e­fits rather than hav­ing to fig­ure out 70 per cent of an em­ployee’s wages, a prob­lem for some an­ti­quated state com­puter sys­tems.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son we had US$600 was its sim­plic­ity,” Mrs Pelosi said.</p>
    <p>On li­a­bil­ity pro­tec­tions, she said Democrats will not sup­port a sce­nario in which work­ers can be told they are es­sen­tial but the em­ployer has no re­spon­si­bil­ity to make the work­place safe for them.</p>
    <p>Mr Mnuchin told Fox News on Sun­day that he was op­ti­mistic about a deal with Democrats.</p>
    <p>“We can move very quickly with the Democrats on these is­sues. We’ve moved quickly be­fore, and I see no rea­son why we can’t move quickly again,” he said.</p>
