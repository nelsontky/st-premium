    <p>With the num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions un­der con­trol in Sin­ga­pore as cases inch towards the sin­gle dig­its, the fo­cus now is on re­viv­ing the flag­ging econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This in­volves the process of re­open­ing, but choos­ing how and when to ease re­stric­tions is hardly a straight­for­ward task and in­volves nu­mer­ous trade-offs, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the de­ci­sion to restart “cruises to nowhere” next month – al­beit at 50 per cent ca­pac­ity – has drawn mixed re­ac­tions about po­ten­tially hav­ing more than a thou­sand pas­sen­gers on board the same ves­sel.</p>
    <p>Many ask why din­ing in groups of larger than five is still not al­lowed, while the eas­ing of bor­der re­stric­tions – seen by some as be­ing riskier – con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions are set to be eased in the com­ing weeks as Sin­ga­pore moves into phase three of re­open­ing, with changes to reg­u­la­tions on the size of group gath­er­ings and par­tic­i­pa­tion at mass events.</p>
    <p>TRADE THE DRIVER OF GROWTH</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say it is im­por­tant to con­tinue the open­ing of in­ter­na­tional chan­nels, as Sin­ga­pore’s open econ­omy is heav­ily de­pen­dent on ex­ter­nal trade in goods and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Economist Song Seng Wun at CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing said: “Trade is three times the size of our econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“When coun­tries are in lock­down and flights are halted, the im­pact on our ex­ports, whether it is ser­vices through Changi Air­port or leisure and travel, will all be heav­ily af­fected.”</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has thrown a life­line, com­mit­ting close to $100 bil­lion in sup­port mea­sures to cush­ion this fall­out.</p>
    <p>This has helped pre­vent gross do</p>
    <p>mes­tic prod­uct from con­tract­ing a fur­ther 5.6 per cent this year and 4.8 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>Some 155,000 jobs would also be saved over these two years, although there will still be job losses over­all. How­ever, re­liefs are only a stop­gap so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“We are a very small coun­try with a small pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“Huge govern­ment spend­ing to lift growth will not be as ef­fec­tive as that forms only a small part of the over­all con­tri­bu­tion to growth,” Mr Song said, stress­ing that the bulk of growth and job cre­ation is a re­sult</p>
    <p>of over­seas de­mand.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, “Sin­ga­pore Air­lines is en­tirely re­liant on in­ter­na­tional de­mand”, Mr Song said.</p>
    <p>“To fly an air­plane, there are also parts that will need re­pair, food for pas­sen­gers, food and bev­er­age out­lets at the air­port ter­mi­nals and so on – plenty of jobs at stake”.</p>
    <p>He noted that a well-con­trolled do­mes­tic sit­u­a­tion gives Sin­ga­pore lee­way to loosen travel curbs.</p>
    <p>The 1.6 mil­lion visi­tors who came ev­ery month on av­er­age last year was re­duced to a trickle, to just 8,900 in Au­gust, a 99.5 per</p>
    <p>cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port slipped from the sev­enth busiest to 58th for in­ter­na­tional pas­sen­ger traf­fic, putting many liveli­hoods at stake.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment last week, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said the need to take proac­tive steps to re­vive the Changi air hub was a top na­tional pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>TOWARDS PHASE THREE</p>
    <p>With many widely an­tic­i­pat­ing phase three to come, Sin­ga­pore­ans can ex­pect loos­en­ing of curbs in cer­tain ar­eas.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, more co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties will be al­lowed to re­sume af­ter the year-end ex­am­i­na­tions in schools, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion an­nounced last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional steps to re­vive air travel can also be an­tic­i­pated – from ne­go­ti­at­ing travel bub­bles to uni­lat­er­ally lift­ing bor­der re­stric­tions on safe coun­tries and re­gions, to the con­tin­ued pur­suit of re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has opened its bor­ders to trav­ellers from Brunei, New Zealand, Viet­nam and Aus­tralia, ex­clud­ing the state of Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>OVER­SEAS DE­MAND KEY</p>
    <p>How­ever, long-term pre­dic­tions on how the global econ­omy will look and the re­bound of travel will be dif­fi­cult to make, said As­so­ci­ate Professor Nitin Pan­garkar from the depart­ment of strat­egy and pol­icy at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School, adding that much would also de­pend on how the coro­n­avirus evolves.</p>
    <p>But changes may be afoot in the avi­a­tion in­dus­try, with air­lines po­ten­tially look­ing to op­er­ate smaller, and hope­fully more nim­ble, fleets.</p>
    <p>Prof Pan­garkar noted that busi­ness travel is likely to be­come</p>
    <p>leaner, as Covid-19 has proved video con­fer­enc­ing to be a vi­able op­tion.</p>
    <p>“This would threaten air­line prof­itabil­ity as first-class and busi­ness­class seats are much more lu­cra­tive over bud­get and econ­omy ones,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>In any case, many peo­ple, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans, are in no hurry to hop on a flight to travel and may pre­fer to wait a lit­tle longer, Mr Song noted.</p>
    <p>TOUGH DE­CI­SIONS</p>
    <p>Against the ur­gent need to re­vive the econ­omy, the risk of a resur</p>
    <p>gence of Covid-19 cases large.</p>
    <p>A cal­i­brated and steady ap­proach prom­ises not to up­set the bal­ance in re­open­ing one sec­tor cau­tiously at a time, watch­ing for flare-ups, and re­lax­ing curbs when the sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises.</p>
    <p>Hence, pri­or­ity has been given to re­lax­ing travel re­stric­tions over in­creas­ing din­ing-in num­bers – a prag­matic de­ci­sion to save vi­tal in­dus­tries over al­low­ing more per­sonal free­doms, said Dr Phua Kai Hong, an ad­junct se­nior re­search fel­low at the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy</p>
    <p>looms</p>
    <p>Stud­ies i n the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Clubs, pubs and karaoke out­lets have to take a back­seat for another rea­son, as they are highly risky and are dif­fi­cult to reg­u­late and con­duct con­tact tracing on.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, chief economist for OCBC Bank, also noted that the do­mes­tic en­ter­tain­ment sec­tor is small and un­likely to move the nee­dle for the econ­omy over­all.</p>
    <p>Eas­ing travel re­stric­tions de­pends not j ust on the Covid-19 “safety” fac­tor – whether the other coun­try has it un­der con­trol – but</p>
    <p>LONG-HAUL JOUR­NEY also how im­por­tant visi­tors from that coun­try are to the Sin­ga­pore market, Ms Ling said, and the eco­nomic links that would make busi­ness travel ad­van­ta­geous.</p>
    <p>She added: “The sit­u­a­tion is quite fluid.</p>
    <p>“I would not be sur­prised if the door is opened or closed again, de­pend­ing on the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion on the ground.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, called de­ci­sion-making “a re­ally dif­fi­cult one” due to the com­pet­ing de­mands of health, eco­nomics, so­cial needs and the big un­cer­tainty of not know­ing the im­pact of each change.</p>
    <p>Health con­sid­er­a­tions are three­fold, Prof Cook added.</p>
    <p>“The first is trans­mis­sion risk, sec­ond, the risk to vul­ner­a­ble groups, and the third is in­di­rect – the im­pact on phys­i­cal and mental health.</p>
    <p>“All three are also very hard to mea­sure.”</p>
    <p>“So­cial im­per­a­tives, like the hap­pi­ness of singing in church, or chil­dren play­ing team sports again, these are hard to put num­bers to. Juggling ev­ery­thing is tough.”</p>
    <p>We are a very small coun­try with a small pop­u­la­tion. Huge govern­ment spend­ing to lift growth will not be as ef­fec­tive as that forms only a small part of the over­all con­tri­bu­tion to growth.</p>
    <p>ECONOMIST SONG SENG WUN, stress­ing that the bulk of growth and job cre­ation is a re­sult of over­seas de­mand.</p>
    <p>RISK AS­SESS­MENT</p>
    <p>Professor Dale Fisher, se­nior con­sul­tant in the in­fec­tious dis­eases di­vi­sion at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, lauded the cau­tious ap­proach, say­ing steady for­ward progress is bet­ter for the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion is aim­ing for just 20 per cent of the world to be vac­ci­nated by De­cem­ber next year, he said: “We don’t want to be bounc­ing be­tween cir­cuit break­ers... It’s drain­ing on most so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>“So this is a long-haul jour­ney.” Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said the ne­ces­sity of ac­cept­ing the risk of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions in or­der to al­low more eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity to re­sume is “a gam­ble gov­ern­ments must take”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Sen­si­ble gov­ern­ments can stack the odds in their favour by en­forc­ing sec­tor-spe­cific mea­sures to re­duce trans­mis­sion risks.</p>
    <p>“The cap of five is one ex­am­ple, and so is the strict rule on maskwear­ing.</p>
    <p>“These al­low most ac­tiv­i­ties, both eco­nomic and in­di­vid­ual, to re­sume while manag­ing trans­mis­sion risks.”</p>
    <p>With the end of the pan­demic still not in sight, the au­thor­i­ties will have to keep per­form­ing this bal­anc­ing act.</p>
    <p>We don’t want to be bounc­ing be­tween cir­cuit break­ers... It’s drain­ing on most so­ci­eties. So this is a long-haul jour­ney.</p>
