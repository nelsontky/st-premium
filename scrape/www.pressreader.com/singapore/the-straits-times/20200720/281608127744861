    <p>Just 2,700 peo­ple are still be­ing housed in four Covid-19 com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties (CCFs) as of July 12, with the virus’ spread in the com­mu­nity re­main­ing low.</p>
    <p>This is down from about 10,600 in­di­vid­u­als in such fa­cil­i­ties as of June 3, more than six weeks back, and also much lower than the max­i­mum ca­pac­ity of the cur­rent fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>CCFs house peo­ple who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, but have mild symp­toms and lower risk fac­tors.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties have been put into re­serve, but the au­thor­i­ties were quick to stress that those fa­cil­i­ties can step up at a mo­ment’s no­tice to pro­vide more beds if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, a Min­istry of Health (MOH) spokesman said Big Box shop­ping mall in Jurong East, one of the most re­cent ad­di­tions to the Gov­ern­ment’s list of such sites, is among those still op­er­at­ing.</p>
    <p>The other three are Sin­ga­pore Expo, Changi Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre, and D’Re­sort NTUC in Pasir Ris – Sin­ga­pore’s first com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­ity set up back in March.</p>
    <p>While MOH did not pro­vide the cur­rent max­i­mum ca­pac­i­ties of these fa­cil­i­ties, the au­thor­i­ties said in late April that there were al­ready a to­tal of 10,000 bed spa­ces at the three sites in the east.</p>
    <p>This num­ber alone is al­most four times the cur­rent num­ber of peo­ple be­ing housed in CCFs, not count­ing Big Box, for which MOH did not pro­vide more de­tails.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral com­mu­nity care and re­cov­ery fa­cil­i­ties such as the mil­i­tary camps, Tuas South, Tan­jong Pa­gar Ter­mi­nal and Prince Ge­orge’s Park Res­i­dences in the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Kent Ridge cam­pus have been pro­gres­sively put into re­serve, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity re­cov­ery fa­cil­i­ties (CRFs) are for those who re­main well at the end of 14 days after first be­ing di­ag­nosed, and who do not re­quire fur­ther med­i­cal care.</p>
    <p>Should the need arise, the re­serve fa­cil­i­ties can be swiftly ac­ti­vated to pro­vide up to 20,000 beds, and</p>
    <p>“swiftly de­ploy the nec­es­sary med­i­cal, ser­vice and an­cil­lary man­power” needed to sup­port the oper­a­tions, MOH said.</p>
    <p>“Each fa­cil­ity has been de­signed and built to fa­cil­i­tate rapid scal­ing up and down de­pend­ing on the needs and lo­cal sit­u­a­tion,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar re­marks were made re­cently by Sin­ga­pore’s top med­i­cal au­thor­ity, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ken­neth Mak, who is the di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices at MOH.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence for the Gov­ern­ment’s multi-min­istry coro­n­avirus task force last Fri­day, where the pos­si­bil­ity of a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions was dis­cussed, Prof Mak said the au­thor­i­ties would con­tinue to be vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>He stressed that while some of these com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties and re­sources have been stepped down be­cause case num­bers have gone down, they have not been taken out of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“They re­main in re­serve. They can eas­ily be stepped up, if we need to, if the cases in the com­mu­nity rise again,” he said, adding that this is some­thing that the task force would con­tinue to track and mon­i­tor.</p>
    <p>Apart from CCFs and CRFs, the Gov­ern­ment also has other com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties at pri­vate and com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>There were 3,618 peo­ple housed in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties as of yes­ter­day.</p>
