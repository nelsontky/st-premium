    <p>While pri­vate home prices con­tinue to rise, there is one place in Sin­ga­pore where you can buy a prop­erty for al­most the same price as 14 years ago.</p>
    <p>As im­prob­a­ble as it sounds, the high-end, ul­tra posh wa­ter­front en­clave of Sen­tosa Cove is now rel­a­tively af­ford­able – al­though you will still need deep pock­ets.</p>
    <p>Prices for non-landed homes have tum­bled al­most 40 per cent since the peak around 2010 and now hover at about $1,394 per square foot (psf).</p>
    <p>That’s close to the $1,176 psf seen in 2006 and about what you would pay for a con­do­minium unit in the Toa Payoh area.</p>
    <p>But while the num­ber of houses and apart­ments has been chang­ing hands at ever-lower prices over the past 16 years or so, 77 per cent of those re­sale trans­ac­tions were still prof­itable, a study by The Sun­day Times has found.</p>
    <p>ST anal­y­sis of Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity caveat in­for­ma­tion that was car­ried out with data and vi­su­al­i­sa­tion ex­pert Yan Naung Oak, founder of con­sul­tancy firm Thibi, noted that prof­itabil­ity dropped when Ad­di­tional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) was in­tro­duced on Dec 8, 2011.</p>
    <p>Since then, only half of the re­sale trans­ac­tions have been prof­itable.</p>
    <p>Av­er­age prof­its ex­clud­ing stamp du­ties and taxes ranged from half a mil­lion to al­most $5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The big­gest loss of $7.12 mil­lion was in­curred by a Bri­tish owner at Seven Palms last year.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ex­perts cited sev­eral rea­sons for the huge losses seen in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Some of the su­per-rich who flocked to the area were will­ing and able to let go of their prop­er­ties at ever-lower prices when they de­cided to leave Sin­ga­pore, said prop­erty an­a­lysts and agents.</p>
    <p>There were also homes sold in mort­gagee sales after own­ers de­faulted on bank loans fol­low­ing the eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties such as the on­go­ing United States-China trade war.</p>
    <p>Projects like Turquoise and Seas­cape, which were sold in 2007 and 2010 at much higher prices hov­er­ing around $2,600 psf, inevitably saw more losses when those units changed hands after cool­ing mea­sures were in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>There have been no prof­itable re­sale trans­ac­tions at Seas­cape and only one re­sale unit has racked up gains at Turquoise.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty re­search and con­sul­tancy head Ni­cholas Mak said the lack of gov­ern­ment pro­mo­tion of the area and in­ter­est from lo­cals were also fac­tors be­hind the price slumps at Sen­tosa Cove.</p>
    <p>Lo­cals tend to be drawn to free­hold prop­erty in prime dis­tricts on the main­land as land on Sen­tosa is­land is lease­hold, added Mr Mak.</p>
    <p>He also noted that for­eign­ers who are not Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dents have to pay 20 per cent ABSD on top of the stan­dard buyer’s stamp duty of up to 4 per cent, mak­ing it one of the big­gest damp­en­ers of the prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Sen­tosa Cove, which be­gan as a res­i­den­tial zone in 2006, is the only en­clave where for­eign­ers can buy landed prop­erty, sub­ject to ap­proval.</p>
    <p>The area has 2,160 homes rang­ing from high-rise con­do­mini­ums to lux­ury bun­ga­lows with ad­join­ing pri­vate berths for boats, all aimed at the ul­tra-rich with its re­sort liv­ing life­style.</p>
    <p>For­eign buy­ers re­port­edly snapped up l anded homes be­tween 2009 and 2011, which led to a spike in prices.</p>
    <p>In June 2013, Sin­ga­porean en­tre­pre­neur Mathilda Koh made a cap­i­tal gain of $18 mil­lion when she sold her bun­ga­low for $26 mil­lion (see other story).</p>
    <p>VOLATILE SIT­U­A­TION</p>
    <p>In 2012, SC Global De­vel­op­ments’ Seven Palms set a record of $4,200 psf for a 99-year lease­hold devel­op­ment when Aus­tralian min­ing mag­nate Gina Rine­hart paid $57 mil­lion for two units.</p>
    <p>A less en­vi­able record was set in Seven Palms last year, when a Bri­tish owner in­curred an al­most 50 per cent loss for his 4,822 sq ft unit when he sold it for $8,880,000 after pay­ing a whop­ping $16 mil­lion in 2010.</p>
    <p>The unit was bought by a busi­ness­man from Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>Mr Jef­frey Chow, an ERA Realty branch di­vi­sion di­rec­tor who took six months to sell the ground floor sea-fac­ing unit, told The Sun­day Times: “The seller de­cided to re­turn to his home town for good and he had no more in­ter­est in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“To the ul­tra-rich, the loss is not huge. He was col­lect­ing rent of $30,000 a month for the unit. Yet he did not want to re­new the lease with the ten­ant.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Sing Tien Foo, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s In­sti­tute of Real Es­tate and Ur­ban Stud­ies, said Sen­tosa Cove buy­ers would not typ­i­cally be so “price-sen­si­tive”.</p>
    <p>“They are the high-end seg­ment of the mar­ket, so they won’t be too con­cerned about the ad­di­tional taxes when they’re buy­ing the unit,” he added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he noted that var­i­ous cool­ing mea­sures over the years could have con­trib­uted to the mar­ket slump, al­though he be­lieves the im­pact is “min­i­mal” for high­net-worth in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank chief econ­o­mist Se­lena Ling said she is not sur­prised that Sen­tosa Cove prop­erty is stuck in the dol­drums while the pri­vate res­i­den­tial prop­erty mar­ket is far­ing bet­ter, given it is un­der­pinned by lo­cal de­mand.</p>
    <p>“Sen­tosa is a very niche mar­ket. While it’s still true that the su­per­rich have been less af­fected by the pan­demic as as­set mar­kets re­main fairly buoy­ant and liq­uid­ity is abun­dant, plus in­ter­est rates are rock bot­tom, nev­er­the­less the global econ­omy is cur­rently mired in a deep re­ces­sion this year,” she noted.</p>
    <p>“Since there’s no lo­cal de­mand un­der­pin­ning the Sen­tosa prop­erty mar­ket, it is prob­a­bly more rel­e­vant to com­pare it with other cities like Lon­don, where the rich buy in­vest­ment prop­er­ties.”</p>
    <p>The av­er­age hold­ing pe­riod for a condo unit in Sen­tosa is 4.1 years and 3.6 years for a landed home, said Mr Pow Ying Khuan, a se­nior an­a­lyst at SRX.</p>
    <p>“With de­pressed prices and low vol­umes, we are un­able to spot any signs of re­cov­ery yet,” he added.</p>
    <p>As of last week, there were 83 landed prop­er­ties and 170 condo units for sale, ac­cord­ing to SRX list­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Mak said: “Ul­ti­mately, real es­tate, be­ing the most im­mov­able as­set in the world, must cater to the needs of lo­cal res­i­dents, even if some of the res­i­dents are for­eign­ers. There­fore, real es­tate needs lo­cal de­mand.</p>
    <p>“It will go through more volatile booms and busts if it de­pends too heav­ily on for­eign de­mand.”</p>
    <p>A Sen­tosa Cove home owner, who wanted to be known only as S. K. Cheah, is dis­ap­pointed that his 1,733 sq ft sea-fac­ing apart­ment is now “grossly un­der­val­ued”.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheah, 60, who owns sev­eral other prop­er­ties in the east and core cen­tral re­gion, paid $3.7 mil­lion for a three-bed­room apart­ment at The Ocean­front in 2007. To­day, he said it is worth $2.7 mil­lion at best but he has no in­ten­tion to sell it as he en­joys liv­ing on the is­land</p>
    <p>“For­eign­ers have a priv­i­lege to pur­chase landed homes on Sen­tosa. I think that priv­i­lege should be ex­tended to the re­moval of ABSD,” said Mr Cheah</p>
    <p>That should help to give a boost to the Sen­tosa prop­erty mar­ket, he added.</p>
    <p>It will go through more volatile booms and busts if it de­pends too heav­ily on for­eign de­mand.</p>
