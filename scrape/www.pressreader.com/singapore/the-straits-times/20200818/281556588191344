    <p>The coro­n­avirus can­not be con­trolled by man, but peo­ple can con­trol their re­sponse to it, says as­sis­tant sports ed­i­tor Ro­hit Bri­j­nath. And some have found sports the best way to deal with this cri­sis – by cy­cling, jog­ging and walk­ing to set­tle their nerves and build re­solve, be­cause these are, in their small way, acts of de­fi­ance in the face of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • On the open­ing night of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s (NBA) restart at Walt Dis­ney World, many miles from Los An­ge­les, the Lak­ers and the Clip­pers put on a show.</p>
    <p>The ex­cite­ment of the Lak­ers’ 103-101 vic­tory on July 30 was ev­ery­thing fans – all those watch­ing from home, any­way – hoped to see af­ter the league had been on hia­tus for four months be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Here were two cham­pi­onship con­tenders, du­elling again in a po­ten­tial pre­view of the West­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Less than three weeks later, the Lak­ers and the Clip­pers still share those lofty goals as they en­ter the play-offs. But both teams are also works in progress, hav­ing ab­sorbed dents in the “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers are thin along the perime­ter, while the Clip­pers are miss­ing bod­ies, in­clud­ing one key re­serve, Mon­trezl Har­rell, who has not played in a game since March 10.</p>
    <p>“Things don’t go as planned,” Clip­pers coach Doc Rivers said. “But we’ve got to get go­ing. We’ve got to get our rhythm dur­ing the play-offs as quickly as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>It would prob­a­bly seem odd in any other sea­son that the two best teams in the West are scuf­fling into the post-sea­son. But this, of course, has not been any other sea­son.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenges will grow only more sig­nif­i­cant for both teams mov­ing for­ward, and nei­ther of them has a par­tic­u­larly soft matchup in the open­ing round.</p>
    <p>The top-seeded Lak­ers will face the Portland Trail Blaz­ers, who are rid­ing the molten bril­liance of Damian Lil­lard, start­ing to­day, while the sec­ond-seeded Clip­pers started their wran­gle with the Dal­las Mav­er­icks’ Luka Don­cic and Kristaps Porzingis on their maiden trip to the post-sea­son yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It feels like a dif­fer­ent sea­son be­cause of the cir­cum­stances,” Lak­ers for­ward LeBron James said. “Ev­ery­thing pretty much in 2020 has felt dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the sea­son was sus­pended in March, the three-time NBA cham­pion had been av­er­ag­ing 25.7 points, 10.6 as­sists and 7.9 re­bounds while shoot­ing 49.8 per cent from the field.</p>
    <p>In seven games in the “bub­ble”, he has av­er­aged 22 points, 7.4 re­bounds and 6.9 as­sists while shoot­ing 44.9 per cent from the field.</p>
    <p>In their eight seed­ing games, the Lak­ers were 3-5. James’ mod­est de­cline in pro­duc­tion can be ex­plained away: He played fewer min­utes than he nor­mally does, and he was work­ing to round into form af­ter an ex­tended lay­off.</p>
    <p>Still, the Lak­ers are not ex­actly soar­ing into the post-sea­son. Their guard play is ques­tion­able. Ra­jon Rondo broke his thumb shortly af­ter ar­riv­ing in the bub­ble, and Avery Bradley, their top perime­ter de­fender, opted not to par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>His ab­sence could loom large against Portland, espe­cially against Lil­lard.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers, on the other hand, would ap­pear to have the pieces – if only they could assem­ble them all on the court at the same time.</p>
    <p>Ivica Zubac con­tracted the coro­n­avirus and was a late ar­rival. Pa­trick Bev­er­ley and Lou Wil­liams all left the bub­ble for stretches for per­sonal rea­sons, as did Har­rell, who only re­cently re­turned af­ter the death of his grand­mother and was still quar­an­tined over the weekend.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers are also try­ing to incorporat­e three rel­a­tively new play­ers: Joakim Noah, Reg­gie Jack­son and Mar­cus Mor­ris Sr and it may be a bit of a leap of faith to sug­gest they can gel in time to win their first cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>STRANGE SEA­SON</p>
    <p>It feels like a dif­fer­ent sea­son be­cause of the cir­cum­stances. Ev­ery­thing pretty much in 2020 has felt dif­fer­ent.</p>
