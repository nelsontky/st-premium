    <p>Ten peo­ple ap­peared in a dis­trict court yesterday after they al­legedly failed to com­ply with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures amid the Covid-19 out­break and met one an­other to con­sume al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>All of them are ac­cused of com­mit­ting the of­fences at a fit­ness cor­ner near Block 42 Beo Cres­cent, off Have­lock Road, on June 28, dur­ing phase two of the economic re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>The 10 peo­ple are: Sai Raghu Vaish­navee Ragu, 18; Aqlima Ab­dul Azmi, 19; Mo­hamad Iman Ab­dul Rahim, 19; Remy Shah Hail Mee, 20; Mo­ham­mad Zack Da­nial Ahamad Zaki, 20; Norsyahmi Norhe­sham, 21; Nur Sal­iza Mo­hamed Sani, 23; Nu­rul Sheilla Nata­sya Suhaimi, 25; Nu­raznie Ith­nin, 31; and Muham­mad Zaki Jo­hari, 33.</p>
    <p>They were each handed two charges un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act and one charge un­der the Liquor Con­trol (Sup­ply and Con­sump­tion) Act.</p>
    <p>In phase two, which be­gan on June 19, each house­hold may re­ceive up to five vis­i­tors a day.</p>
    <p>This means that groups of up to five peo­ple can also meet out­side of homes, such as at restau­rants for meals.</p>
    <p>They should, how­ever, prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing and avoid mix­ing be­tween dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
    <p>At least two of the al­leged of­fend­ers, Norsyahmi and Zack Da­nial, live in dif­fer­ent units at Block 42 Beo Cres­cent.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers had al­legedly trav­elled there from other places, in­clud­ing Jalan Bukit Merah, Telok Blan­gah Cres­cent and Bukit Ba­tok West Av­enue 8.</p>
    <p>All 10 are ac­cused of meet­ing one an­other to chat and con­sume liquor at the fit­ness cor­ner at around 1am on June 28.</p>
    <p>They are said to have con­sumed liquor there dur­ing the pre­scribed no-pub­lic-drink­ing pe­riod be­tween 10.30pm and 7am.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said in a state­ment on Tues­day that be­sides th­ese 10 peo­ple, three oth­ers, in­clud­ing a 14-year-old boy, were also part of the group.</p>
    <p>The boy was given a 12-month con­di­tional warn­ing, while the other two are cur­rently be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for un­re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also said that they found out about the gath­er­ing after of­fi­cers re­ceived a “noise pol­lu­tion com­plaint” at the block at around 12.50am on June 28.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers who ar­rived at the scene saw that 13 peo­ple had gath­ered in the vicin­ity.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers also found bot­tles of liquor there.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, the 10 al­leged of­fend­ers told the court that they in­tend to plead guilty to their charges.</p>
    <p>They will be back in court next month.</p>
