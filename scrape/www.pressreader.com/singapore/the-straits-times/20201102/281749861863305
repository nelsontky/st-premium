    <p>BANGKOK • Thou­sands of yel­low-shirt Thai roy­al­ists yes­ter­day staged their big­gest show of sup­port for the monar­chy so far, in the face of months of protests that have called for royal re­forms as well as the re­moval of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s time that we came out to pro­tect our beloved monar­chy,” said Mr Bin Bun­leu­rit, a for­mer film star turned res­cue vol­un­teer who had en­cour­aged peo­ple to demon­strate at the Grand Palace in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one has the right to ad­vo­cate for what­ever change they want, but what is the rea­son they want to re­form the monar­chy?”</p>
    <p>The Palace has made no com­ment since the start of the protests in mid-July.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers said King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s pow­ers are too great and want to re­verse changes that gave him per­sonal con­trol of some army units and a palace for­tune val­ued in the tens of bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>They also crit­i­cised the King’s long stays in Ger­many as waste­ful and ac­cused the monar­chy of en­abling decades of army dom­i­na­tion by ac­cept­ing coups such as the one in which Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha took power in 2014.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent- and youth-led protests ini­tially sought the re­moval of Mr</p>
    <p>Prayut, but have since mor­phed into the great­est chal­lenge to the monar­chy since the end of ab­so­lute royal rule in 1932. The big­gest protests have drawn tens of thou­sands of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>For­mer Bud­dhist monk Suwit Thong­prasert, a roy­al­ist leader, wel­comed the size of yes­ter­day’s crowd. “It is a sig­nal to those who want to abol­ish the monar­chy to think of the peo­ple,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Three high-pro­file protest lead­ers were hos­pi­talised over the week­end af­ter po­lice said they were be­ing re-ar­rested at the ex­piry of the limit to their de­ten­tion. Panupong “Mike” Jad­nok, Panusaya “Rung” Sithi­ji­rawat­tanakul and Parit “Pen­guin” Chi­warak are among the best-known faces of Thai­land’s pro-democ­racy move­ment.</p>
    <p>A crim­i­nal court last Fri­day or­dered the re­lease of the trio, who had been in cus­tody since midOc­to­ber on sedi­tion charges.</p>
    <p>But dur­ing the trip from the pri­son to the po­lice sta­tion late on Fri­day, Panupong fainted in po­lice cus­tody – lo­cal me­dia said plain­clothes of­fi­cers had held him in a choke­hold.</p>
    <p>Shards of bro­ken glass fell on Parit from a smashed ve­hi­cle win­dow, and Panusaya had an un­ex­plained foot in­jury.</p>
