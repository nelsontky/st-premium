    <p>MUMBAI • In­dia yes­ter­day dis­placed Brazil to take sec­ond place af­ter the United States in terms of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, with 90,082 new cases, while some cities re­opened un­der­ground train services shut­tered for months.</p>
    <p>With its na­tion­wide tally of 4.2 mil­lion ex­ceeded only by the US fig­ure of 6.2 mil­lion, In­dia is adding more cases each day than any other coun­try this year since the out­break of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say there is no sign of a peak as cases surge in the world’s sec­ond most pop­u­lous coun­try, both in big cities like New Delhi and Mumbai, and ru­ral ar­eas that have lim­ited ac­cess to health services.</p>
    <p>“It’s be­com­ing a dou­ble bur­den,” Dr Ra­jib Das­gupta, a pro­fes­sor of com­mu­nity health at Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity i n Delhi, told Reuters. “The ur­ban ar­eas are not slow­ing down and ru­ral ar­eas are pick­ing up.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s jump was the third straight daily record in In­dia, data showed, pro­vi­sion­ally car­ry­ing its tally past Brazil, which has just over 4.1 mil­lion cases, al­though the time dif­fer­ence means the South Amer­i­can na­tion will re­lease its cor­re­spond­ing fig­ure later.</p>
    <p>The death toll of 71,642 in In­dia com­pares with nearly 193,000 in the US and 126,000 in Brazil.</p>
    <p>In­dia says its ris­ing in­fec­tions also re­flect higher rates of test­ing, adding that high re­cov­ery rates show its strat­egy of test­ing, trac­ing and treat­ment is work­ing. In­dia has been test­ing more than 10 mil­lion peo­ple per day on av­er­age, with plans to ramp it up fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Com­muters were sparse as New Delhi re­sumed metro rail services af­ter a break of more than five months, with sta­tions nearly de­serted. Bars will open from to­mor­row in the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“There was no prob­lem com­mut­ing in the metro. So­cial dis­tanc­ing is be­ing fol­lowed and... peo­ple are us­ing face masks and sani­tis­ing,” pas­sen­ger Deepak Ku­mar, who took the sub­way to work in Delhi, told AFP. “For our lives to move on, we have to get out of our homes... so this is a good move by the gov­ern­ment to start the metro trains.”</p>
    <p>Par­tial metro train services also opened i n the west­ern city of Ahmed­abad, the north­ern city of Lucknow and sev­eral other places, af­ter nearly six months of sus­pen­sion over the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Pres­sure is grow­ing on Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s gov­ern­ment to pull the econ­omy out of a deep freeze af­ter a se­vere lock­down in March shut­tered busi­nesses and left mil­lions with­out jobs.</p>
