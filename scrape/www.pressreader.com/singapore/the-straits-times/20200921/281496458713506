    <p>The Aus­tralian state of New South Wales (NSW) faced an un­usual po­lit­i­cal cri­sis this month in which the gov­ern­ment al­most col­lapsed due to a bit­ter feud over pro­tect­ing koalas.</p>
    <p>In what seemed a pe­cu­liarly Aus­tralian or­deal, the state’s National Party threat­ened to ef­fec­tively with­draw from the rul­ing Lib­eral-National Coali­tion over laws that safe­guard koala habi­tats by rais­ing the num­ber of pro­tected trees from 10 to 65. The mea­sures were in­tro­duced fol­low­ing a par­lia­men­tary report warn­ing that koalas will be ex­tinct by 2050 with­out ur­gent in­ter­ven­tion to pre­vent habi­tat loss.</p>
    <p>But the Na­tion­als, a ru­ral-based party, threat­ened to end its par­lia­men­tary sup­port for the gov­ern­ment over the mea­sures, say­ing the koala changes were un­fair to farm­ers and would limit land use and pre­vent the clear­ing of trees. Even­tu­ally, it backed down af­ter Lib­eral leader and state Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian agreed to dis­cuss the is­sue at a fu­ture Cabi­net meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The “koala war” has high­lighted on­go­ing con­cerns about the level of pro­tec­tion for the en­vi­ron­ment in Aus­tralia, which has a no­to­ri­ously poor record of ex­tinc­tion of species and de­struc­tion of forests.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has the world’s worst</p>
    <p>mam­mal ex­tinc­tion rate, with about 34 mam­mals lost since Euro­pean coloni­sa­tion 230 years ago. Causes of the ex­tinc­tions in­clude the in­tro­duc­tion of non-na­tive an­i­mals such as cats and foxes, and land clear­ing – mainly to en­able ur­ban de­vel­op­ment and agri­cul­ture – as well as the chang­ing cli­mate.</p>
    <p>In 2018, a report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) listed Aus­tralia’s east coast among 11 re­gions fac­ing the most se­vere de­for­esta­tion, mak­ing it the only de­vel­oped na­tion on a list that in­cluded In­done­sia and Brazil.</p>
    <p>But en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion re­mains a thorny po­lit­i­cal is­sue. The Lib­eral-National Coali­tion, which is in power fed­er­ally, has tended to be</p>
    <p>split be­tween the city-based Lib­er­als and ru­ral-based Na­tion­als. And the Lib­eral Party has long been split on cli­mate pol­icy be­tween mod­er­ates, who sup­port strong ac­tion, and a re­sis­tant con­ser­va­tive wing.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment is cur­rently push­ing ahead with con­tro­ver­sial laws that will hand en­vi­ron­men­tal pow­ers to the states and ter­ri­to­ries, ef­fec­tively mak­ing them re­spon­si­ble for ex­am­in­ing the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of ma­jor de­vel­op­ments. Crit­ics say this will al­low greater scope for min­ing firms, farm­ers and de­vel­op­ers to raze bush­land and over­ride pro­tec­tions for flora and fauna.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Sus­san Ley in­sists the laws will re­move red tape and speed up ap­provals, and are nec­es­sary to as­sist with the eco­nomic re­cov­ery from the Covid-19 cri­sis. She said ear­lier this month the move “will re­duce reg­u­la­tory bur­den, pro­mote eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and cre­ate cer­tainty around en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tions”. She had also as­sured that the gov­ern­ment would in­tro­duce “strong rig­or­ous en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards” along­side the new en­vi­ron­ment laws.</p>
    <p>But con­ser­va­tion groups say the changes will weaken en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tions and lead to fur­ther species ex­tinc­tions. En­vi­ron­men­tal groups, in­clud­ing the WWF and Aus­tralian Con­ser­va­tion Foun­da­tion, wrote to Unesco ear­lier this month, warn­ing that the changes could ex­ac­er­bate threats to Aus­tralia’s world her­itage ar­eas.</p>
    <p>They said hand­ing con­trols to states and ter­ri­to­ries was risky as their gov­ern­ments were “of­ten the pro­po­nents of th­ese threat­en­ing de­vel­op­ments and ac­tiv­i­ties or have poli­cies that en­cour­age and fast­track them”.</p>
    <p>The laws have passed the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives but are yet to be ap­proved by the Se­nate, where the coali­tion does not have a ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion La­bor Party is against the laws, say­ing the gov­ern­ment should in­clude a set of national en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards and cre­ate an in­de­pen­dent reg­u­la­tor to en­force pro­tec­tions. Other in­de­pen­dent and mi­nor party MPs said they will not sup­port the leg­is­la­tion un­less it is first re­viewed by a com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>An in­de­pen­dent re­view of Aus­tralia’s ex­ist­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion leg­is­la­tion is due next month. But an in­terim report in June backed moves to over­haul the pro­tec­tion laws. “Aus­tralia’s nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment and iconic places are in an over­all state of de­cline and are un­der in­creas­ing threat. The cur­rent en­vi­ron­men­tal tra­jec­tory is un­sus­tain­able,” the report said.</p>
