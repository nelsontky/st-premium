    <p>Ja­panese artist Hiroko Taka­hashi fought sex­ism and sus­pi­cion from tra­di­tional ki­mono ar­ti­sans to es­tab­lish a glob­ally known brand that sold hun­dreds of her orig­i­nal gar­ments every month – un­til the coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>She has tried to re­group by sell­ing hand­made masks sewn from ki­mono fab­ric.</p>
    <p>“My de­signs are kind of strong, so there are peo­ple who re­sist the idea of wear­ing them in some­thing full­body,” the 42-year-old said. “But they’d love to wear it as a mask.”</p>
    <p>But the masks are a long fall from her orig­i­nal busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Noted for her bold, uni­sex prints for both ki­mono and yukata – a lighter ki­mono – and her re­fusal to ac­cept con­ven­tional lim­its on wear­ing them, Taka­hashi was part of an ex­hibit this year at Lon­don’s Vic­to­ria and Al­bert Mu­seum.</p>
    <p>She also has a con­tract to pro­vide yukata for a new lux­ury ho­tel as Ja­pan gears up to host the Olympics.</p>
    <p>Suc­cess took time. When she be­gan, tra­di­tional dy­ers hated her de­signs and re­fused to work with her. When she called to check on progress, they would hang up.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing a woman and young can make it hard to work in Ja­pan,” she said.</p>
    <p>But she per­sisted un­til she was sell­ing 100 to 200 made-to-or­der yukata a month – re­mark­able suc­cess in an in­dus­try de­clin­ing so steadily that sales now hover around 16 per cent of what they were in 1981, ac­cord­ing to govern­ment data.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic changed ev­ery­thing. De­part­ment stores shut for weeks, the Olympics were post­poned to next year and the ho­tel open­ing was put off. Sum­mer fes­ti­vals and fire­works dis­plays, usu­ally prime yukata-wear­ing oc­ca­sions, were can­celled na­tion­wide in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“We have ab­so­lutely noth­ing,” she said. “I’ve done noth­ing new this year. No new de­signs, no new colours.”</p>
    <p>Though Taka­hashi is teach­ing and ek­ing out i ncome making ki­mono fab­ric masks, her in­come has taken a ma­jor hit. Her yukatas started at 60,000 yen (S$780) each and ki­mono at 3 mil­lion yen, but the masks go for just 1,400 yen each.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic could dev­as­tate the ki­mono in­dus­try, where age­ing ar­ti­sans, each spe­cial­is­ing in a sin­gle stage of the process, are find­ing it im­pos­si­ble to en­vi­sion fu­ture work.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of peo­ple who ex­pected to hang in there, but with the virus and not enough work com­ing in, they’re de­cid­ing to call it quits,” said Mr Kazumi Fu­ruoya, 44, a third-gen­er­a­tion ki­mono tai­lor who works with his wife and par­ents in the Den-en-chofu area of Tokyo.</p>
    <p>A gen­er­a­tion ago, the Fu­ruoya work­shop was so busy, it scram­bled to keep up with or­ders.</p>
    <p>A re­cent sur­vey by Aeru, a com­pany pro­mot­ing tra­di­tional crafts, found that un­less de­mand im­proves, about 40 per cent of ar­ti­sans may be forced to quit by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>“If a fab­ric-maker goes un­der, there’s noth­ing to dye and if the dy­ers quit, we can’t make ki­monos,” Taka­hashi said. “If one goes down, we all do.”</p>
    <p>Even if de­mand picks up, the im­pact may be last­ing. A lack of or­ders means new tai­lors can­not prac­tise enough.</p>
    <p>“Ki­monos are part of Ja­panese cul­ture and as long as even one artisan re­mains, I want to work with them to keep things go­ing – be­cause once some­thing van­ishes, bring­ing it back is re­ally hard,” Taka­hashi said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know how much strength I have, but if I can con­trib­ute even a lit­tle to this, it’ll be good.”</p>
