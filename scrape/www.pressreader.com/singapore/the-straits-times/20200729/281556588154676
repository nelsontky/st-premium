    <p>Once the pre­serve of spec­u­la­tors and in­vest­ment mav­er­icks, crypto as­sets are mov­ing higher up the radar screens of com­mer­cial banks, hedge funds and other in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors. In­ter­est­ingly, Covid-19 has had cen­tral banks warm­ing to dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies, says as­so­ciate edi­tor Vikram Khanna (be­low).</p>
    <p>If you had bought a bit­coin on March 17, when Covid-19 was roil­ing fi­nan­cial mar­kets, you would have more than dou­bled your money by July 27, when the value of bit­coin soared past US$10,000. Some other crypto as­sets such as Ethereum, Rip­ple and Monero have also been on a tear.</p>
    <p>Stock mar­kets have shot up as well, but their per­for­mance pales com­pared to the best per­form­ing crypto as­sets. Covid-19 has made crypto hot again.</p>
    <p>Once the pre­serve of spec­u­la­tors and in­vest­ment mav­er­icks, crypto as­sets are mov­ing higher up the radar screens of com­mer­cial banks, hedge funds and other in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors. In May, star fund man­ager Paul Tu­dor Jones re­vealed that he has been in­vest­ing in bit­coin, which made many main­stream in­vestors sit up.</p>
    <p>But per­haps most in­ter­est­ing of all, some of the world’s cen­tral banks are warm­ing to the world of crypto. While they have al­ways watched the space with in­ter­est, the Covid-19 pan­demic has cre­ated a greater sense of ur­gency for them to act.</p>
    <p>In its June An­nual Eco­nomic Re­port, the Bank for In­ter­na­tional Set­tle­ments (BIS) – the so-called “cen­tral banks of cen­tral banks” – had a chap­ter on cen­tral banks and pay­ments in the dig­i­tal era. It points to a greater will­ing­ness on the part of th­ese in­sti­tu­tions to not only em­brace dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies, but also be­come more ac­tive par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>No­tably, the re­port points out that the bal­ance of opin­ion among cen­tral bankers is shift­ing in favour of launch­ing cen­tral bank dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies (CBDCs) at the re­tail level – that is, for the gen­eral public, some­thing which they viewed with scep­ti­cism un­til as re­cently as last year. There are many mo­ti­va­tions for this.</p>
    <p>One is the grow­ing pro­lif­er­a­tion of private dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies such as bit­coin and oth­ers. There is also a pro­posal by Face­book to launch a dig­i­tal cur­rency called Libra – a so-called “sta­ble­coin”, which would not be hugely volatile be­cause it would be pegged to ma­jor fiat cur­ren­cies such as the US dol­lar and the euro.</p>
    <p>Th­ese al­ter­na­tives could threaten the hege­mony of na­tional cur­ren­cies, which might, for ex­am­ple, find it hard to com­pete with Libra if it were ex­tended to Face­book’s 2.6 bil­lion users world­wide.</p>
    <p>De­spite run­ning into reg­u­la­tory road­blocks and be­ing aban­doned by many of the com­pa­nies that had orig­i­nally signed up as Face­book’s part­ners in the ven­ture, Libra was a wake-up call for cen­tral banks.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond mo­ti­va­tion for some cen­tral banks to con­sider launch­ing dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies is the dom­i­nance of the US dol­lar, which ac­counts for more than 60 per cent of bank re­serves and more than 70 per cent of all trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The “weapon­i­sa­tion” of the US dol­lar by the United States, for ex­am­ple, by re­strict­ing its use for cross-bor­der trans­ac­tions by coun­tries un­der US sanc­tions, such as Iran and Venezuela, has gal­vanised some cen­tral banks to de­velop dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies that would en­able their coun­tries to work around such sanc­tions. This was al­most cer­tainly a ma­jor mo­ti­va­tion for China to launch its own dig­i­tal yuan in April.</p>
    <p>COVID-19 AS A CAT­A­LYST</p>
    <p>And then came Covid-19, which has forced many cen­tral banks to se­ri­ously re­con­sider their op­po­si­tion to re­tail CBDCs.</p>
    <p>As Dr Hyun Song Shin, the eco­nomic ad­viser to the BIS and its head of re­search, has pointed out, the pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated con­tact­less pay­ments as well as re­mote pay­ments for on­line trans­ac­tions, and the use of cash has fallen – all of which has strength­ened the case for a dig­i­tal pay­ments sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion is an­other is­sue. Gov­ern­ments, es­pe­cially in ad­vanced economies, have launched huge bud­getary sup­port pack­ages in re­sponse to Covid-19, but have not al­ways been able to ef­fi­ciently reach the peo­ple most af­fected.</p>
    <p>While there have been some di­rect trans­fers to bank ac­counts and e-wal­lets, many peo­ple around the world still do not have bank ac­counts and even if they do, they have of­ten had to wait for cheques to ar­rive by post, which has been slow dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With on­line pay­ments be­com­ing more com­mon, their costs have also come un­der the spot­light. Charges for the use of credit cards, bank fees and for­eign ex­change fees in the case of cross-bor­der trans­fers are af­fect­ing con­sumers and mer­chants alike.</p>
    <p>This is a prob­lem that pro­po­nents of private crypto as­sets have long com­plained about. As Mr Mar­cus Lim, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sin­ga­pore-based dig­i­tal as­set ex­change Zip­mex said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times: “If you want to trans­fer money cross-bor­der, it should be in­stant. You shouldn’t have to go through the Swift net­work, which is more than 40 years old. There shouldn’t be all th­ese mid­dle­men tak­ing com­mis­sions, goug­ing con­sumers with fees and charges. That’s un­ac­cept­able in this dig­i­tal age.”</p>
    <p>OP­TIONS FOR CBDCS</p>
    <p>But what shape re­tail CBDCs will take is still be­ing de­bated.</p>
    <p>There are ba­si­cally two op­tions. One is di­rect, whereby con­sumers and busi­nesses would have in­di­vid­ual ac­counts with the cen­tral bank. For ex­am­ple, you would have an ac­count with the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) through which you can make and re­ceive pay­ments. The MAS would main­tain a ledger in which cred­its and deb­its are recorded. This would lead to faster, ef­fi­cient pay­ments with real-time set­tle­ment, in which com­mer­cial banks would not have to be in­volved and no cash would be needed.</p>
    <p>But this op­tion would run the risk of dis­in­ter­me­di­at­ing the banks, which might lose de­posits – the main source of their fund­ing. Yet, they would still need to make loans, which cen­tral banks can­not do. Nor are cen­tral banks equipped to carry out know-your-cus­tomer and anti-money-laun­der­ing pro­cesses, which are es­sen­tials in the bank­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The other op­tion is one where the MAS would cre­ate a dig­i­tal cur­rency that would have the same value as the nor­mal cur­rency, but would dis­trib­ute it via the banks and pay­ment providers, which would en­able th­ese play­ers to con­tinue of­fer­ing fi­nan­cial services.</p>
    <p>If the dig­i­tal cur­rency is non-in­ter­est bear­ing – it would only be a means of pay­ment – banks would still be able to col­lect de­posits.</p>
    <p>Through an app, con­sumers would be able to switch some of their cash hold­ings to dig­i­tal cash, which could be stored in an e-wal­let on their phones that is linked to their bank ac­count, and then use their phones to pay on­line or in stores. They need never use credit cards or phys­i­cal cash to pay and the need for mer­chants to store and han­dle cash would dras­ti­cally de­cline.</p>
    <p>CBDCs would not nec­es­sar­ily have to go through a blockchain – cer­tainly not one of a de­cen­tralised na­ture like bit­coin – be­cause cen­tral banks gen­er­ally com­mand the trust of their cit­i­zens; they would not need de­cen­tralised blockchain tech­nol­ogy to fos­ter trust.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the pro­po­nents of bit­coin and other private crypto as­sets ar­gue that the cen­tral­i­sa­tion of any pay­ment ledger runs the risk of be­ing hacked – both banks and com­pa­nies have been hacked in the past. Even cen­tral banks have been hacked, in­clud­ing the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank.</p>
    <p>“But bit­coin is un­hack­able,” says Zip­mex’s Mr Lim. “In its 11 years of ex­is­tence, it’s never been hacked. You can’t re­v­erse a trans­ac­tion on the blockchain.”</p>
    <p>He con­cedes that the de­cen­tralised blockchain on which bit­coin de­pends is slow in pro­cess­ing trans­ac­tions. But he be­lieves this tech­ni­cal prob­lem will be sorted out, which will ac­cel­er­ate adop­tion.</p>
    <p>The other in­fras­truc­ture needed for dig­i­tal pay­ments to be­come main­stream – such as com­pa­nies and con­sumers cre­at­ing dig­i­tal wal­lets – also has a long way to go.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal pay­ments ecosys­tem is about where the In­ter­net was in the mid-1990s, when most com­pa­nies didn’t even have web­sites, which are now a must-have. Com­pre­hen­sive reg­u­la­tion of dig­i­tal as­sets and clear guide­lines on how play­ers can op­er­ate are also needed.</p>
    <p>The move to­wards CBDCs will have to be ac­com­pa­nied by proper reg­u­la­tion. Once that is in place, there will be greater in­ter­est in the use and trad­ing of dig­i­tal as­sets, as more in­sti­tu­tional play­ers come in.</p>
    <p>More as­sets will be “to­kenised” – that is, made trad­able in dig­i­tal form, in­clud­ing illiq­uid as­sets such as real es­tate and fine art. At some stage, there will be a tip­ping point af­ter which dig­i­tal as­sets will ex­pe­ri­ence what Mr Lim calls “hockey stick growth”.</p>

    <p>CRYPTO IN­VESTORS ON A ROLL</p>
    <p>But mean­while, en­joy­ing hand­some re­turns, in­vestors in crypto as­sets have the wind at their back. Bit­coin funds are be­ing launched. Hedge funds are in­vest­ing in cryp­tos. Broking firms such as TD Amer­i­trade have started to of­fer their re­tail cus­tomers dig­i­tal as­sets, in­clud­ing bit­coin fu­tures, and are fund­ing crypto ex­changes.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 and the pol­icy re­sponse to it have ac­cel­er­ated such trends.</p>
    <p>For crypto in­vestors, the sight of cen­tral banks flood­ing their economies with liq­uid­ity and gov­ern­ments run­ning up record fis­cal deficits calls for some in­sur­ance against the de­base­ment of fiat cur­ren­cies that might fol­low – a view shared by gold in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The way crypto in­vestors see it, as the sup­ply of bit­coin is lim­ited, its value has grown as a form of in­sur­ance in a world of un­lim­ited quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing (the print­ing of money with­out limit) that we are now in.</p>
    <p>Whether the pay­ment sys­tem of the fu­ture will be dom­i­nated by CBDCs, private crypto as­sets, or some com­bi­na­tion of the two is not clear – both have their ad­van­tages and dis­ad­van­tages. But what looks cer­tain is that Covid-19 has brought for­ward the ex­pi­ra­tion date on phys­i­cal cash.</p>
