    <p>•</p>
    <p>WILMINGTON US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den will for­mally in­tro­duce his top eco­nomic pol­icy ad­vis­ers as his ad­min­is­tra­tion pre­pares to take power amid a slow­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery ham­pered by the resur­gent coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den was sched­uled to ap­pear yes­ter­day at an event in his home­town of Wilmington, Delaware, along­side his se­lec­tions for se­nior roles in his ad­min­is­tra­tion, in­clud­ing his nom­i­nee for Trea­sury sec­re­tary, for­mer Fed­eral Re­serve chair Janet Yellen.</p>
    <p>The team’s make-up re­in­forces Mr Bi­den’s view that a more ag­gres­sive ap­proach to the pan­demic is re­quired. The ad­vis­ers have all ex­pressed sup­port for gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus to max­imise em­ploy­ment, re­duce eco­nomic in­equal­ity and help women and mi­nori­ties, who have been dis­pro­por­tion­ately hurt by the eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>Other top picks in­clude Ms Ce­cilia Rouse, an econ­o­mist at Prince­ton Univer­sity, as chair of the Coun­cil of Eco­nomic Ad­vis­ers; econ­o­mists Heather Boushey and Jared Bern­stein as coun­cil mem­bers; and Ms Neera Tan­den, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the lib­eral Cen­tre for Amer­i­can Progress think-tank, as head of the Of­fice of Man­age­ment and Bud­get (OMB).</p>
    <p>The tran­si­tion is pro­ceed­ing de­spite Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s false claims that he lost the elec­tion as a re­sult of voter fraud.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Bi­den re­ceived his first full clas­si­fied in­tel­li­gence brief­ing since win­ning the Nov 3 elec­tion, af­ter Mr Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede de­layed the for­mal tran­si­tion process for weeks.</p>
    <p>Ari­zona and Wis­con­sin, two bat­tle­ground states where Mr Trump has pur­sued fruit­less ef­forts to over­turn the re­sults, each cer­ti­fied Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of vote to­tals is typ­i­cally a for­mal­ity, but the process took on added sig­nif­i­cance amid Mr Trump’s al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has pur­sued a se­ries of le­gal chal­lenges in nu­mer­ous states, although none has thus far re­sulted in any mean­ing­ful gains for the Pres­i­dent. Most of the law­suits have been re­jected by judges, who have ex­pressed scep­ti­cism about the claim that the elec­tion re­sults are il­le­git­i­mate.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign planned to file a law­suit in the Wis­con­sin Supreme Court yes­ter­day, al­leg­ing abuse around the process of ab­sen­tee vot­ing, Fox News re­ported. The cam­paign did not re­ply to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The Elec­toral Col­lege, which se­lects the pres­i­den­tial win­ner based on state-by-state re­sults, is sched­uled to meet on Dec 14.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, the Demo­cratic for­mer vice-pres­i­dent, will take of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>His lat­est nom­i­na­tions will place sev­eral women in top eco­nomic roles, re­flect­ing his com­mit­ment to in­creas­ing di­ver­sity at the high­est lev­els of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Rouse would be the first black woman to lead the Coun­cil of Eco­nomic Ad­vis­ers, Ms Tan­den would be the first woman of colour to run the OMB, and Ms Yellen would be the first fe­male Trea­sury sec­re­tary. All three would re­quire Se­nate con­fir­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Con­trol of the Se­nate will be de­cided in a pair of run-off elec­tions in Ge­or­gia on Jan 5.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral aid pro­grammes aimed at com­bat­ing the pan­demic’s eco­nomic dam­age, such as ex­panded un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits, are set to ex­pire this month, and a new stim­u­lus Bill has been trapped in po­lit­i­cal limbo for months with Repub­li­cans and Democrats at odds over the size of the spend­ing pack­age.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has killed more than 267,000 peo­ple in the United States, with cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions reach­ing record highs in re­cent weeks.</p>
