    <p>Hong Kong’s pri­vacy chief Tony Lam has crit­i­cised the United</p>
    <p>States Trea­sury Depart­ment for “doxxing” Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam and other of­fi­cials by re­leas­ing their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion as part of its sanc­tions on them.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s pri­vacy chief has crit­i­cised the US Trea­sury Depart­ment for “doxxing” Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam and other of­fi­cials by re­leas­ing their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion as part of its sanc­tions on them.</p>
    <p>“The dis­clo­sure of the data of the per­sons con­cerned by the US Depart­ment of the Trea­sury is ob­vi­ously ex­ces­sive and un­nec­es­sary,” Act­ing Pri­vacy Com­mis­sioner Tony Lam said.</p>
    <p>Us­ing or re­pro­duc­ing the ad­dresses, pass­port num­bers and other data could be a crime, he added. “It amounts to doxxing.”</p>
    <p>The US last Friday said it is sanc­tion­ing 11 Chi­nese of­fi­cials and their al­lies in Hong Kong over their roles in cur­tail­ing po­lit­i­cal free­doms in the former Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s na­tional se­cu­rity law for Hong Kong has un­der­mined the city’s au­ton­omy and in­fringed on the rights of res­i­dents, it said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam was tar­geted for her role in im­ple­ment­ing Bei­jing’s poli­cies “of sup­pres­sion of free­dom and demo­cratic pro­cesses”, ac­cord­ing to the US state­ment.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has es­ca­lated pressure on sev­eral fronts against China’s grow­ing role on the world stage, which has be­come a key cam­paign is­sue in the up­com­ing US elec­tion. Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has threat­ened to take ac­tion since Bei­jing im­posed the sweep­ing law in June.</p>
    <p>China’s im­ple­men­ta­tion of the law and the re­ac­tion of ma­jor trad­ing part­ners which have crit­i­cised it could have a sub­stan­tial im­pact on the Hong Kong econ­omy that is al­ready battered by months of antigov­ern­ment protests and coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tions also em­bold­ened crit­ics of the Hong Kong govern­ment else­where, with a Bri­tish law­maker re­viv­ing calls for curbs on it.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, the re­ac­tion has been a cho­rus of crit­i­cism from lo­cal of­fi­cials, with Mrs Lam’s govern­ment call­ing the move “shame­less and de­spi­ca­ble”, while Bei­jing’s Li­ai­son Of­fice in the city said Wash­ing­ton had “mis­cal­cu­lated”.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tioned in­di­vid­u­als in­clude Mr Xia Bao­long, di­rec­tor of the Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice of China’s State Coun­cil, and Mr Chris Tang, com­mis­sioner of the Hong Kong po­lice force.</p>
    <p>“The United States stands with the peo­ple of Hong Kong and we will use our tools and au­thor­i­ties to tar­get those un­der­min­ing their au­ton­omy,” Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin said.</p>
    <p>The tar­geted peo­ple will have any prop­erty and as­sets in the US frozen. But it is not clear if any of them will be af­fected fi­nan­cially.</p>
    <p>Mr Luo Huin­ing, the di­rec­tor of the Li­ai­son Of­fice, said he does not have any as­sets or prop­erty in any for­eign coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong Mon­e­tary Author­ity said lo­cal banks have no obli­ga­tion to fol­low US sanc­tions un­der Hong Kong law and that the len­ders should treat cus­tomers fairly in as­sess­ing whether to con­tinue pro­vid­ing ser­vices to them.</p>
    <p>The city’s Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Com­mis­sion said that in con­sid­er­ing the sanc­tions’ im­pli­ca­tions, in­ter­me­di­aries are ex­pected to “care­fully as­sess any le­gal, busi­ness and com­mer­cial risks that they may be ex­posed to”, adding that it ex­pects any re­sponse to the re­stric­tions to be nec­es­sary, fair and in the in­ter­est of the “in­tegrity of the mar­ket”.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor said it is “mon­i­tor­ing closely the im­pact the sanc­tions may have... in Hong Kong”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam said he would write to the US to ex­press dis­ap­point­ment over the re­lease of the data.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Lam said she may can­cel her US visa, which is valid un­til 2026. She sug­gested that the US Trea­sury may have ob­tained her in­for­ma­tion from a visa ap­pli­ca­tion in 2016, with­out up­dat­ing her ad­dress.</p>
