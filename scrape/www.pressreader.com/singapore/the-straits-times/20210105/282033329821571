    <p>For­mer Sin­ga­pore Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board of­fi­cer Abel Ang spent three years in Ger­many in the early 2000s. He was given the task of invit­ing Ger­man multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions to in­vest in Sin­ga­pore to ac­cel­er­ate their Asian ex­pan­sion (When the go­ing gets tough, the tough can han­dle it, Jan 3).</p>
    <p>With his time in Ger­many, he was able to com­pare the re­silience of the Ger­mans and Sin­ga­pore­ans in their re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He high­lighted the Ger­man econ­omy’s re­silience due to its de­pen­dence on man­u­fac­tur­ing – build­ing a strong engi­neer­ing base, un­der­pinned by an em­pha­sis on ed­u­ca­tion, ap­pren­tice­ships and other in-work train­ing. The eco­nomic re­silience of the coun­try is ev­i­denced by the steep re­bounds in man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Sin­ga­pore can no longer de­pend on its man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, which cre­ated jobs and wealth for the past 40 years. Man­u­fac­tur­ing con­tri­bu­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct has dropped over the years.</p>
    <p>As the threat of Covid-19 starts to wind down with the ar­rival of vac­cines, Sin­ga­pore must move from re­lief not only to re­cov­ery, but also to rein­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>So what needs to be rein­vented? The virtues of Ger­many’s strong engi­neer­ing base with an em­pha­sis on ap­pren­tice­ship have been ex­tolled by our var­i­ous govern­ment agen­cies af­ter each study trip to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>One of the key at­tributes of Ger­man ap­pren­tice­ships is the re­spect for prac­ti­cal work or what is com­monly known as blue-col­lar work.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore­ans were al­ready strug­gling with the deeper prob­lem of “skills mis­match” as the econ­omy re­struc­tured.</p>
    <p>At the same time, with new tech­nol­ogy trans­form­ing work, busi­nesses were strug­gling to find work­ers with the skills to man new ma­chines and man­age new pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the pan­demic is the im­pe­tus needed to rein­vent our ap­proach to de­vel­op­ing our work­force, to re­vive our econ­omy and to re­duce our de­pen­dence on for­eign work­ers for blue-col­lar jobs.</p>
