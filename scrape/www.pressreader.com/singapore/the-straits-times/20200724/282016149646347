    <p>Sin­ga­pore has raised the lo­cal pro­duc­tion of wa­ter to meet de­mand, af­ter part of the wa­ter sup­ply from Malaysia had to be “iso­lated” fol­low­ing re­ports from house­holds here about an unusual scent of pan­dan in boiled tap wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The cause of the scent is an or­ganic com­pound known as tetrahy­dro­fu­ran (THF), which is com­monly used as an in­dus­trial sol­vent.</p>
    <p>Na­tional wa­ter agency PUB said its in­ves­ti­ga­tions traced the source of the is­sue to wa­ter im­ported from Malaysia.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book up­date yes­ter­day, PUB said it has “iso­lated” the af­fected wa­ter, and that pro­duc­tion has been in­creased at wa­ter­works in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“We also took ex­tra pre­cau­tion to flush out the af­fected net­work pipes and wa­ter tanks, and re­plen­ished them with wa­ter pro­duced by our lo­cal wa­ter­works,” said PUB, al­though it did not pro­vide de­tails on how much lo­cal wa­ter pro­duc­tion was boosted on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The Jo­hor River in Malaysia is a ma­jor source of wa­ter for Sin­ga­pore, but the Repub­lic can also count on its three other taps – de­sali­na­tion, treat­ment of used wa­ter, as well as rain­wa­ter col­lected in Sin­ga­pore’s 17 reser­voirs.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported on Wed­nes­day that a num­ber of house­holds in Sin­ga­pore – such as in Pasir Ris, Yishun and Tampines – had no­ticed an unusual scent of pan­dan in boiled tap wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The scent was not ap­par­ent un­til the wa­ter was boiled.</p>
    <p>Lab­o­ra­tory tests had found trace lev­els of less than 10 parts per bil­lion of the THF or­ganic com­pound in the wa­ter sup­ply.</p>
    <p>This con­cen­tra­tion is equiv­a­lent to dis­solv­ing two ta­ble­spoons of a sub­stance in an Olympic-size swim­ming pool, PUB said.</p>
    <p>It added that THF is highly sol­u­ble and has a low boil­ing point but in this case, be­cause the amounts present in the wa­ter were so mi­nus­cule, it would have no ad­verse im­pact on health.</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s up­date, PUB said cus­tomers should not de­tect any smell from tap wa­ter freshly supplied from Sin­ga­pore’s wa­ter­works.</p>
    <p>“Any smell could be due to rem­nant wa­ter re­main­ing in house pipes,” said the agency.</p>
    <p>“This can be re­solved by run­ning the taps for about five min­utes to flush out the wa­ter.”</p>
    <p>PUB said it will con­tinue to mon­i­tor wa­ter qual­ity closely.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Shane Sny­der, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Nanyang En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­search In­sti­tute at the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, said at the “ex­tremely low con­cen­tra­tions re­ported”, THF is very dif­fi­cult to de­tect.</p>
    <p>THF is unique be­cause the hu­man nose can de­tect minute con­cen­tra­tions, bet­ter than most an­a­lyt­i­cal de­vices, he said.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent gen­er­a­tion of on­line sen­sors are not able to de­tect such a low amount of a com­pound like THF, though this is a ma­jor area of re­search for my team at NTU,” Prof Sny­der said.</p>
    <p>He added that the i nci­dent showed Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to re­spond quickly and ad­e­quately to con­tam­i­na­tion events.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to con­tinue to in­vest in re­search that can bet­ter de­tect such con­tam­i­na­tion, but still, the re­sponse from PUB is very im­pres­sive to me and my col­leagues,” said Prof Sny­der.</p>
