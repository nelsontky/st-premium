    <p>It’s to­tally okay to be in those kind of sit­u­a­tions that suck.</p>
    <p>HANERI (left), a can­cer survivor, was briefly home­less dur­ing her so­journ in the United States</p>
    <p>Af­ter spend­ing more than a month home­less in the United States at the end of 2019, singer Haneri made the de­ci­sion to come home to Sin­ga­pore for good.</p>
    <p>The singer bet­ter known here as Daphne Khoo had been based in Los An­ge­les since 2016.</p>
    <p>Her artiste visa, which al­lowed her to stay in the US, had ex­pired. While wait­ing for it to be re­newed, she could not take on any jobs.</p>
    <p>“I was in limbo, I wasn’t re­ally do­ing any­thing. I was bleed­ing money be­cause I couldn’t work, so I just went into my sav­ings,” she tells The Straits Times in a re­cent in­ter­view at her man­age­ment’s of­fice at Pasir Pan­jang Power Sta­tion.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, her land­lord took back the place she was rent­ing be­fore she could ar­range for an­other lease. And be­cause she was go­ing to fly off for con­certs in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, she did not want to start a new lease else­where and ended up sleep­ing on friends’ couches. In De­cem­ber 2019, she flew back to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“By the time I came home in De­cem­ber, I was like, ‘I think I’m just ready to move on’. Be­cause I was ex­hausted.</p>
    <p>“There was so much un­cer­tainty. Since May that year, I was not sure where I was go­ing to be, what I was go­ing to do, where I was go­ing to sleep.”</p>
    <p>Khoo, who is also an ac­tivist for can­cer-re­lated causes af­ter hav­ing sur­vived ovar­ian can­cer, has taken all that life has thrown at her in her stride.</p>
    <p>She says calmly: “It’s to­tally okay to be in those kind of sit­u­a­tions that suck.”</p>
    <p>The con­tes­tant on the first Sin­ga­pore Idol in 2004 has bounced back with a new EP, Mil­liona, which caps an event­ful past two years.</p>
    <p>She went back to the US in Jan­u­ary last year to set­tle her be­long­ings there. Then she flew back to Sin­ga­pore in April, this time with her dog, a Mal­tese mix named Snow­ball. She has been liv­ing with her par­ents since then.</p>
    <p>De­spite the rough patches, there were also bright spots in her Amer­i­can so­journ.</p>
    <p>Real Love, a song that she wrote about her dog, gained trac­tion in the US in 2018. It gar­nered more than 1.7 mil­lion views on YouTube and was used on the sound­track of MTV’s re­al­ity show about on­line dat­ing, Cat­fish: The TV Show (2012 to present).</p>
    <p>She also has other songs which did well. A 2018 sin­gle with Bri­tish dance act Dasco, What­ever You Like, has clocked close to eight mil­lion lis­tens on mu­sic stream­ing ser­vice Spo­tify.</p>
    <p>The songs on her new EP such as Y Didn’t You Say So and Play Nice re­flect her grow­ing con­fi­dence in over­com­ing her in­se­cu­ri­ties, says the singer. She had moved to Bos­ton in 2010 and ob­tained a mu­sic de­gree at Berklee Col­lege of Mu­sic.</p>
    <p>She was back in Sin­ga­pore from 2014 to 2016 and was a ra­dio DJ on Power 98FM.</p>
    <p>The EP ti­tle Mil­liona is taken from her Chi­nese name “Yi”, which trans­lates to “a hun­dred mil­lion”. The four tracks are co-pro­duced with Amer­i­can mu­si­cian Drew Ofthe Drew, her fel­low</p>
    <p>Berklee Col­lege of Mu­sic grad­u­ate.</p>
    <p>These days, Khoo is keep­ing her­self busy with sev­eral dif­fer­ent projects: from a self-pro­duced doc­u­men­tary se­ries on her life on YouTube to live-stream­ing gam­ing ses­sions on Twitch.</p>
    <p>“I’m just try­ing to keep my­self open, so that I can just lean into what­ever it is that comes my way. But I’m al­ways go­ing to be mak­ing mu­sic.”</p>
