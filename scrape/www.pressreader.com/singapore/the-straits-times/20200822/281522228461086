    <p>• Nip­pon Paint Hold­ings, Ja­pan’s big­gest paint maker, struck a 1.29 tril­lion yen (S$16.7 bil­lion) deal to join with bil­lion­aire Goh Cheng Liang’s Wuthe­lam Hold­ings, seek­ing to cre­ate a dom­i­nant paints and coat­ings com­pany in Asia.</p>
    <p>The deal in­volves Wuthe­lam tak­ing a ma­jor­ity stake by buy­ing new shares in Nip­pon Paint, which will use the bulk of the money to buy out their joint ven­tures in China, In­dia, Malaysia, Sin­ga­pore, South Korea and Thai­land. Nip­pon Paint will also take over Wuthe­lam’s wholly owned In­done­sia busi­ness for about US$2 bil­lion (S$2.7 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Wuthe­lam’s stake in the Ja­panese com­pany will rise to just un­der 60 per cent, from 39 per cent, in one of the big­gest trans­ac­tions in Asia this year.</p>
    <p>Wuthe­lam Hold­ings is a closely held paint and coat­ings maker.</p>
    <p>Its founder, Mr Goh, 93, moved up this year to third place on Forbes’ list of Sin­ga­pore’s rich­est as his net worth in­creased to US$14.8 bil­lion from US$9.5 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>Nip­pon Paint has had ties with Wuthe­lam for more than 50 years. Mr Goh started mak­ing paints in a small fac­tory in Sin­ga­pore be­fore he went on to part­ner with Nip­pon Paint in 1962, Forbes re­ported.</p>
    <p>His son Hup Jin was ap­pointed chair­man of Nip­pon Paint in March 2018 and also runs their pri­vately held joint ven­ture, the Nip­pon Paint South-east Asia Group, or Nipsea.</p>
    <p>Although the two sides op­er­ated Nipsea to­gether for years, the elder Mr Goh be­gan ef­forts in 2013 to gain ma­jor­ity con­trol of the Ja­panese paint com­pany.</p>
    <p>The new ar­range­ment should stream­line their cor­po­rate struc­ture and make it more flex­i­ble, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence an­a­lyst Ho­race Chan.</p>
    <p>“The struc­ture change is much an­tic­i­pated and it was faster than my ex­pec­ta­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Be­cause Nip­pon Paint has more con­trol over Nipsea, mi­nor­ity share­holder i nter­ests should be pro­tected even though Wuthe­lam will be­come a con­trol­ling share­holder of the Ja­panese paint maker, Mr Chan added.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh’s stake in Nip­pon Paint via Wuthe­lam will even­tu­ally reach 58.7 per cent when the trans­ac­tion closes next Jan­uary, ac­cord­ing to No­mura Hold­ings, Nip­pon Paint’s sole fi­nan­cial ad­viser in the trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Nip­pon Paint will re­main a listed com­pany, chief ex­ec­u­tive Masaaki Tanaka said at a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The shares of Nip­pon Paint climbed 6.5 per cent by the close in Tokyo. The stock is up 51 per cent this year. The Nikkei news­pa­per first re­ported the news ear­lier, spark­ing the share rally.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh and Nip­pon Paint de­cided to unify their Asian busi­nesses to seek “more am­bi­tious moves” to grow and de­liver share­holder re­turns, they said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The many ap­pli­ca­tions of paint in­clude res­i­den­tial and com­mer­cial constructi­on, trans­port ap­pli­ca­tions such as cars and trains, and in­fra­struc­ture such as bridges and roads, mean­ing that de­mand for paint grows in step with pop­u­la­tion growth and ur­ban­i­sa­tion,” Nip­pon Paint said, adding that these trends are strong­est in Asia and are likely to de­liver greater sales growth.</p>
    <p>Most of the money from the deal will be kept within the broader or­gan­i­sa­tion, and Mr Tanaka said merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions will be ac­cel­er­ated.</p>
    <p>Last year, Nip­pon paint bought Aus­tralia’s Du­lux Group for A$4 bil­lion (S$3.9 bil­lion) and Turkey’s Betek Boya ve Kimya Sanayi.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Mitsushige Akino, se­nior ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer at Ichiyoshi As­set Man­age­ment: “Asian com­pa­nies are get­ting stronger and nar­row­ing the com­pe­ti­tion gap with Ja­panese busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>He added: “There could be more con­sol­i­da­tion in the ba­sic ma­te­ri­als space. Look­ing at it in terms of auto pro­duc­tion, spread­ing into Asian coun­tries makes sense.”</p>
