    <p>Malaysian glove mak­ers are threat­en­ing to sup­plant the once-mighty gam­ing com­pa­nies in the na­tion’s bench­mark eq­uity in­dex, thanks to the spec­tac­u­lar rally in their shares.</p>
    <p>Supermax and Kossan Rub­ber In­dus­tries may join big­ger ri­vals Top Glove and Hartalega Hold­ings in the 30-stock FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI In­dex af­ter a re­view of the gauge’s mem­bers next month or in December, ac­cord­ing to an­a­lysts at May­bank In­vest­ment Bank and Smartkarma.</p>
    <p>The two stocks are ex­pected to re­place casino gi­ant Gent­ing and its unit Gent­ing Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The likely en­trants are al­ready worth more than some of the gauge’s mem­bers by mar­ket value af­ter the boom in glove de­mand dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic sent their shares to dizzy­ing heights.</p>
    <p>Supermax has soared more than 1,400 per cent this year, while Kossan’s stock has more than tripled.</p>
    <p>The makeover of the South-east Asian bench­mark from one tra­di­tion­ally led by banks, util­i­ties and gam­ing un­der­scores huge in­vestor de­mand for com­pa­nies mak­ing hy­giene prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Val­ued at RM76 bil­lion (S$24.85 bil­lion), Top Glove is close to over­tak­ing Malayan Bank­ing as the big­gest stock on the KLCI In­dex, and Hartalega is in third po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>With the new ad­di­tions, glove mak­ers’ weight­ing in the gauge will jump to about 20 per cent from around 15 per cent at present, ac­cord­ing to the an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>“For ev­ery $100 com­ing to the KLCI In­dex, about $20 is go­ing to go into glove mak­ers af­ter the re</p>
    <p>view,” Smartkarma an­a­lyst Brian Fre­itas from New Zealand said in a phone in­ter­view. While the ad­di­tions are hap­pen­ing af­ter the sharp rally, there is still a lot of vis­i­bil­ity on de­mand for gloves, he said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia this week im­posed re­stric­tions on move­ment in its cap­i­tal city of Kuala Lumpur, ad­min­is­tra­tive cap­i­tal Pu­tra­jaya and the states of Se­lan­gor and Sabah as the coun­try bat­tles a spike in virus cases. The na­tion re­ported 589 new cases on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Surg­ing de­mand for gloves has spurred other com­pa­nies to dive into the busi­ness. Mah Sing Group, one of Malaysia’s big­gest de­vel­op­ers, said on Thurs­day that it plans to</p>
    <p>ac­quire 12 new pro­duc­tion lines to re­duce de­pen­dence on its prop­erty busi­ness, which has been af­fected by the pan­demic. The stock soared as much as 34 per cent yes­ter­day and prompted mul­ti­ple an­a­lyst up­grades on the com­pany’s shares.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Gent­ing and its units have started to make work­force and pay cuts, ow­ing to the pan­demic. Gent­ing’s mar­ket value has shrunk to RM11.7 bil­lion from more than RM40 bil­lion al­most a decade ago.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Supermax’s mar­ket value has surged to RM27 bil­lion this year, while Kossan’s has climbed to more than RM20 bil­lion, Bloomberg-com­piled data shows.</p>
    <p>The con­stituent changes will be</p>
    <p>CON­TIN­U­ING DE­MAND FOR GLOVES</p>
    <p>For ev­ery $100 com­ing to KLCI In­dex, about $20 is go­ing to go into glove mak­ers af­ter the re­view.</p>
    <p>MR BRIAN FRE­ITAS, an an­a­lyst at Smartkarma.</p>
    <p>im­ple­mented af­ter the end of trad­ing on Dec 18, and will be ef­fec­tive Dec 21, May­bank’s head of re­search Wong Chew Hann wrote in a note this month.</p>
