    <p>Seven in 10 small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) af­fected by the pan­demic are con­fi­dent of meet­ing re­pay­ment obli­ga­tions for govern­ment-backed loans next year with­out im­pact­ing their busi­ness op­er­a­tions, a sur­vey has found.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey by DBS Bank cov­ered close to 250 SMEs in three sec­tors that are most af­fected by Covid-19 – re­tail, food and bev­er­age, as well as build­ing and con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>The bank con­ducted the sur­vey early last month, after the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore an­nounced ex­tended credit re­lief sup­port mea­sures for SMEs to par­tially de­fer the prin­ci­pal re­pay­ment of se­cured loans and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore loans.</p>
    <p>Over­all, some three-quar­ters of</p>
    <p>SME own­ers said that they con­tinue to be “op­ti­mistic” and “de­ter­mined”. How­ever, they also ac­knowl­edged the toll the out­break has taken, with one in five in­di­cat­ing that they were “ex­hausted” from deal­ing with the on­go­ing eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>DBS group head of SME bank­ing Joyce Tee noted that while the sur­vey shows that SMEs are wounded, they are “cer­tainly not out for the count”. “In fact, many SMEs are qui­etly pre­par­ing for a re­bound and even those in the hard­est-hit sec­tors have been busy rein­vent­ing them­selves and trans­form­ing their busi­ness mod­els,” she said.</p>
    <p>To meet debt obli­ga­tions, close to 30 per cent of SMEs sur­veyed were will­ing to sac­ri­fice expansion plans and scale down their busi­ness op­er­a­tions to make their re­pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Only 3 per cent flagged that they were not con­fi­dent of meet­ing their loan re­pay­ments next year and may have to shut their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also saw SMEs across all three sec­tors iden­ti­fy­ing work­ing cap­i­tal as a top pri­or­ity to tide over the eco­nomic down­turn, with 65 per cent of re­spon­dents in­di­cat­ing that this fac­tor is key to help­ing them cope with over­heads.</p>
    <p>Since early March, DBS has ap­proved close to 9,700 loans to­talling over $5 bil­lion to SMEs through the Tem­po­rary Bridg­ing Loan and En­hanced Work­ing Cap­i­tal Loan schemes, among other sup­port ini­tia­tives.</p>
