    <p>I am shocked and sad­dened by the vi­o­lence and harm suf­fered by the for­mer girl­friend of NUS den­tistry stu­dent Yin Zi Qin, but at the same time, I was sur­prised by how harshly some have con­demned the of­fender (MHA to re­view penalty frame­work in cases sim­i­lar to that of NUS stu­dent, July 22).</p>
    <p>I am a so­cial worker who has worked with youth of­fend­ers, and I do not think that Yin’s sen­tence is ei­ther ex­traor­di­nar­ily light or ex­traor­di­nar­ily heavy.</p>
    <p>The pun­ish­ment meted out to him is in fact com­pa­ra­ble to a prison sen­tence, and will be trau­matic for any­one with no prior con­vic­tion or known in­volve­ment with crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Yin will face re­stric­tions on his free­dom and an un­for­giv­ing en­vi­ron­ment in prison which will not be eas­ily borne.</p>
    <p>Al­though he will not have a for­mal crim­i­nal record, this pe­riod of de­ten­tion will have a phys­i­cal, emo­tional and psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact that should not be un­der­es­ti­mated or down­played.</p>
    <p>Many young peo­ple who went through sim­i­lar forms of re­stric­tion con­tin­ued to im­prison them­selves men­tally and emo­tion­ally even af­ter they had served their time.</p>
    <p>If they lack suf­fi­cient fam­ily and so­cial sup­port, they of­ten find it dif­fi­cult to find their place in so­ci­ety again, and end up go­ing back to the crim­i­nal net­works and ac­tiv­i­ties they wanted to leave be­hind.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, Sin­ga­pore­ans have made strong calls for a more com­pas­sion­ate and a caring so­ci­ety, which I find heart­en­ing.</p>
    <p>If we are to truly be­come a com­pas­sion­ate so­ci­ety, we should look out not just for those who need to be helped and pro­tected, but also for those who need help turn­ing their lives around.</p>
    <p>Pun­ish those who cross the line, but if re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion is pos­si­ble, we should not con­demn them for the rest of their lives.</p>
