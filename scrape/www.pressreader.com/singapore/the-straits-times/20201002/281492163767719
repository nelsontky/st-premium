    <p>Mil­i­tary train­ing will be pro­gres­sively stepped up in the com­ing months with Covid-19 safety mea­sures firmly in place, the Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ba­sic train­ing was sus­pended for seven weeks dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod ear­lier this year, and re­sumed in late May with safety mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>The Of­fi­cer Cadet and Spe­cial­ist Cadet schools con­tin­ued op­er­at­ing through­out the cir­cuit breaker with pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Min­def said the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) “will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore and re­view the safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place to keep ser­vice­men safe”.</p>
    <p>Two batches of re­cruits have since been trained at the SAF Ba­sic Mil­i­tary Train­ing Cen­tre (BMTC) on Pu­lau Tekong.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence and Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad was at the BMTC yes­ter­day morn­ing to ob­serve new re­cruits who took the oath of al­le­giance at a cer­e­mony in the au­di­to­rium.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 256 re­cruits were en­listed yes­ter­day, part of a batch of 4,000 to be en­listed this quar­ter. Those at­tend­ing the cer­e­mony sat one seat apart from one another.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia later, Mr Zaqy said: “Covid-19 pan­demic or not, it’s im­por­tant that we main­tain a high level of readi­ness, a high level of prepa­ra­tion, to en­sure that the mil­i­tary op­er­a­tions and se­cu­rity of our na­tion can still be pro­tected.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the BMTC still en­listed re­cruits and ran smoothly amid the virus out­break.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy as­sured par­ents that Covid-19 safety mea­sures are in place, both proac­tive and re­ac­tive to the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to give par­ents and loved ones at home that as­sur­ance that their sons and daugh­ters here in the SAF are well looked af­ter, kept safe and given peace of mind,” he said.</p>
    <p>Pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures at the BMTC in­clude tem­per­a­ture-tak­ing twice a day, en­hanced hy­giene prac­tices and fre­quent dis­in­fec­tion of com­mon ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Re­cruits also carry out ac­tiv­i­ties at a sec­tion level, com­pris­ing 16 peo­ple, in­stead of the larger pla­toon or com­pany level, such as for shoot­ing prac­tice or route marches around the is­land.</p>
    <p>Meal times are also stag­gered to prevent over­crowd­ing, with plas­tic bar­ri­ers sep­a­rat­ing the re­cruits from one another at the ta­ble while they eat.</p>
    <p>First War­rant Of­fi­cer Har­dial Singh, 58, a pla­toon com­man­der at the BMTC, said that while train­ing has changed with the new mea­sures im­ple­mented, the stan­dard of train­ing has not.</p>
    <p>He said that con­duct­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in smaller groups means that it takes more time.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the SAR-21 ri­fle­han­dling ses­sion typ­i­cally takes half a day for a com­pany to com­plete, but with the new rules, it now takes a full day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, 1WO Singh noted that a smaller group size means that of­fi­cers in charge can ob­serve the per­for­mance of re­cruits more closely, such as iden­ti­fy­ing weaker shoot­ers. This will en­able them to pro­vide these re­cruits with ex­tra guid­ance.</p>
    <p>Re­cruit Se­bas­tian Chew, who has been train­ing at the BMTC for two months, said that his par­ents were ini­tially wor­ried about the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion when he en­listed in July.</p>
    <p>“I think this is quite un­avoid­able for all par­ents. But af­ter en­list­ing, we were all quite as­sured be­cause of the mea­sures that are put in place,” he said.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old added that the re­cruits know that any per­son who is un­well can re­port to the med­i­cal cen­tre, without fear of reper­cus­sions or con­se­quences.</p>
