    <p>The em­ploy­ment sit­u­a­tion here is cause for con­cern. Nearly half the em­ploy­ees of the Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre have been re­trenched amid the dire straits which the meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions sec­tor finds it­self in be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. About 13 per cent of the work­force were af­fected by a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise at Boe­ing Asia Pa­cific Avi­a­tion Ser­vices, a joint ven­ture be­tween The Boe­ing Com­pany and SIA En­gi­neer­ing Com­pany. Bri­tish jet en­gine-maker Roll­sRoyce will man­u­fac­ture its wide-chord fan blades en­tirely in Sin­ga­pore and move some oper­a­tions back to Bri­tain as part of the aero­space gi­ant’s con­sol­i­da­tion plans amid the pan­demic. The com­pany an­nounced ear­lier that 240 work­ers here would be laid off as part of a global re­struc­tur­ing ex­er­cise. Sec­tors hard hit by Covid-19 have shed work­ers as a last re­sort, which was not un­ex­pected. But it still comes as a nasty sur­prise for those af­fected. The out­look re­mains gloomy un­til a sus­tain­able eco­nomic re­cov­ery takes off.</p>
    <p>As the job sit­u­a­tion wors­ens, it re­mains im­por­tant for the Govern­ment and em­ploy­ers to care for the Sin­ga­porean core of the work­force. The lat­est move in that direc­tion lies in the de­ci­sion to raise qual­i­fy­ing salaries for Em­ploy­ment Pass and S-Pass ap­pli­cants. Al­though the in­crease will raise costs for some busi­nesses, the change is a re­flec­tion of the grav­ity of the sit­u­a­tion fac­ing Sin­ga­porean work­ers as higher un­em­ploy­ment kicks in and more peo­ple work shorter hours and look for an ad­di­tional job. The new hir­ing re­quire­ments are a re­minder to com­pa­nies that they must pri­ori­tise the em­ploy­ment of qual­i­fied or suit­able Sin­ga­pore­ans over for­eign­ers where pos­si­ble. Build­ing up and re­tain­ing the Sin­ga­porean core is nec­es­sary in the best of times. In the worst, it is crit­i­cal so that Sin­ga­pore­ans do not lose faith in the eq­uity of the eco­nomic sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Last week’s of­fi­cial clar­i­fi­ca­tion on the scope of the Sin­ga­pore-In­dia Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment should also help clear up mis­con­cep­tions that some for­eign­ers en­joy carte blanche rights to work and live here per­ma­nently.</p>
    <p>There is no such un­con­di­tional ac­cess to Sin­ga­pore and im­mi­gra­tion priv­i­leges. In­stead, Sin­ga­pore’s for­eign labour pol­icy adopts a cal­i­brated ap­proach to the qual­ity and quan­tity of for­eign­ers needed to com­ple­ment the lo­cal work­force. This in­cre­men­tal ap­proach avoids the need for dras­tic ad­just­ments to labour sup­ply pol­icy even in dif­fi­cult times, as is cur­rently the case.</p>
    <p>The goal is to re­tain and im­prove Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic com­pet­i­tive­ness vis-a-vis the rest of the world. The in­ten­tion is not to dis­cour­age com­pe­ti­tion from for­eign work­ers but to en­sure that the com­pe­ti­tion takes place in a con­text that does not dis­ad­van­tage lo­cal work­ers, whom em­ploy­ers must treat fairly in all cir­cum­stances.</p>
