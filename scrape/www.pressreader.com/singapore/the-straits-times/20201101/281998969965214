    <p>For some, play­ing the pi­ano well might be a dif­fi­cult feat to ac­com­plish. But Ms Siti Sak­i­nah Zainal not only mas­tered the in­stru­ment in seven years, she also did it de­spite be­ing blind.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old hu­man re­sources ex­ec­u­tive learns her pieces by lis­ten­ing to them, play­ing them back to me­morise them, and pick­ing up the mu­si­cal cues from the con­duc­tor’s breath­ing when she is play­ing in an or­ches­tra.</p>
    <p>She was among the many peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties ( PWDs) who made up a ma­jor­ity of the 113 per­form­ers at the Pur­ple Pa­rade 2020 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Held an­nu­ally since 2013, the pa­rade is Sin­ga­pore’s largest move­ment to sup­port the in­clu­sion of PWDs and cel­e­brate their abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, huge crowds turned up at Hong Lim Park and Sun­tec City to take part in the fes­tiv­i­ties, which typ­i­cally in­cluded a mas­sive car­ni­val, march and con­cert. This year, ow­ing to the Covid-19 out­break, the or­gan­is­ers have moved the events on­line.</p>
    <p>More than 2,600 Sin­ga­pore­ans, in­clud­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, pledged in a video mon­tage yes­ter­day to sup­port in­clu­sion and cel­e­brate the abil­i­ties of PWDs.</p>
    <p>In­stead of a car­ni­val, Pur­ple Pa­rade mer­chan­dise was sold on­line. And for the first time, a vir­tual “pur­ple map” re­placed the march as a sign of sol­i­dar­ity, al­low­ing peo­ple to leave on­line mes­sages of in­clu­sion and sup­port for PWDs.</p>
    <p>The con­cert was live-streamed on the Pur­ple Pa­rade’s Face­book page, with a spe­cial screen­ing at the Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre for in­vited guests that also in­cor­po­rated some live seg­ments.</p>
    <p>About 35,000 peo­ple tuned in to the livestream.</p>
    <p>The au­di­ence was treated to rous­ing drum and wushu per­for­mances, songs, dances and a spe­cial mu­sic video, per­formed mostly by PWDs.</p>
    <p>Those watch­ing from home had the chance to win prizes and gifts made by PWDs by shar­ing and com­ment­ing on the stream.</p>
    <p>Ms Sak­i­nah, who played the pi­ano as part of The Pur­ple Sym­phony – Sin­ga­pore’s largest in­clu­sive or­ches­tra – said it was an hon­our to per­form at the con­cert.</p>
    <p>“(The pa­rade) is a great op­por­tu­nity to show peo­ple that al­though we’re PWDs, we can do things that nor­mal peo­ple can do as well. And some of the things we can do, nor­mal peo­ple can’t do,” she said.</p>
    <p>House­wife June Lim, 45, whose 20-year-old son Royce played the cello with the sym­phony, said she was very proud of him.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lim said she had never ex­pected her son, who has autism, to per­form at such a big event.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy that he’s part of this or­ches­tra… and do­ing some­thing to show­case his abil­ity to every­one, that he can do this. It’s very heart­warm­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>The vice-chair­man of this year’s Pur­ple Pa­rade work­ing com­mit­tee, par­a­lympian Yip Pin Xiu, said that plan­ning for the event for­mat amid Covid-19 was a “daunt­ing yet ex­cit­ing task”, and that the pan­demic should not be a rea­son to re­duce sup­port for PWDs.</p>
    <p>The mayor of Cen­tral Sin­ga­pore Dis­trict and ad­viser to the Pur­ple Pa­rade, Ms Denise Phua, said she hopes the Pur­ple Pa­rade will re­mind peo­ple that PWDs are not “ob­jects of pity or char­ity”, but equal mem­bers of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“They, like the rest of us, de­serve equal ac­cess and full par­tic­i­pa­tion in all as­pects of life, such as daily liv­ing, good ed­u­ca­tion, work, health­care, mo­bil­ity and so­cial re­la­tion­ships,” she said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the event, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who was the guest of hon­our, said: “The spirit of the Pur­ple Pa­rade must con­tinue even af­ter this con­cert and even af­ter the fes­tiv­i­ties end... To­gether, we can do so much more to build a Sin­ga­pore that is fairer, more equal and more in­clu­sive,” he said.</p>
    <p>VALU­ABLE EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>I’m happy that he’s part of this or­ches­tra… and do­ing some­thing to show­case his abil­ity to every­one, that he can do this. It’s very heart­warm­ing.</p>
