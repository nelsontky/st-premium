    <p>The work­places of ath­letes are known to smell of grubby socks and per­spi­ra­tion, chlo­rine and frus­tra­tion, and yet they’d never ex­change them. As Derek Jeter once drawled: “My of­fice is at Yan­kee Sta­dium.”</p>
    <p>You can do your ac­count­ing at home in your py­ja­mas, but ath­letes need to get into are­nas and re­spond to the en­ergy. It’s where they be­come whole.</p>
    <p>And so when I asked ath­letes, as one Covid year bends into an­other, what their wish list is for 2021, nat­u­rally odour came up. “I want to be able to feel and smell com­pe­ti­tion halls in in­ter­na­tional venues again,” said fencer Amita Berthier. “Have that adren­a­line rush and that bit of ner­vous­ness be­fore com­pet­ing.”</p>
    <p>As Jan­uary beck­ons, lists are be­ing made by ath­letes. Lists of wishes and goals. Lists of how they can stretch them­selves. Last month af­ter his lat­est world record, breast­stro­ker Adam Peaty said on the BBC pod­cast Don’t Tell Me The Score: “Af­ter the ini­tial kind of high... (it’s) how do we get faster next time.” There’s al­ways room for a faster time on a list.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes make lists of po­si­tions they’re chas­ing, some first place, some a fifth spot, some plain crazy. Michael Phelps later ad­mit­ted he “wanted to change the sport of swim­ming”. Oh, only that. Th­ese lists are writ­ten in op­ti­mistic ink and kept in a drawer of dreams.</p>
    <p>For nurse cum rower Joan Poh, her wish list in­cludes find­ing a way “to fly my Cana­dian coach to Singapore for a train­ing stint much needed by us both”. For high jumper Kamp­ton Kam it’s hop­ing to “rep­re­sent Singapore at the</p>
    <p>2021 SEA Games in Viet­nam”.</p>
    <p>Tessa Neo – the 10m air ri­fle shooter who se­cured a Tokyo 2020 quota spot for Singapore – wishes to “per­se­vere till the end (of the se­lec­tion com­pe­ti­tions) and earn the op­por­tu­nity to com­pete in next year’s Olympic Games”.</p>
    <p>Later, she adds: “An­other wish would be to win at the Games and do the na­tion proud.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond ques­tion I asked ath­letes was, “What’s the most amaz­ing thing you saw in sport this year?” and for syn­chro­nised swim­mer Deb­bie Soh it was ath­letes with a voice. Or as she put it: “See­ing ath­letes from dif­fer­ent back­grounds, who may speak dif­fer­ent lan­guages, come to­gether to stand up for com­mon ini­tia­tives like speak­ing up about men­tal health or the hid­den abuse in sport.”</p>
    <p>Ath­letes, quite beau­ti­fully, were mostly amazed by each other. In­spired by the re­silience they saw. Im­pressed by the drive they found. In a way they were all lift­ing each other out of dis­tress.</p>
    <p>Amaz­ing, said swim­mer Yip Pin Xiu, was “ath­letes still train­ing and ev­ery­one still do­ing their best even if no com­pe­ti­tion was in sight”.</p>
    <p>Amaz­ing, said Kam, was ath­letes “train­ing in creative and in­ge­nious ways, espe­cially in the Ul­ti­mate Gar­den Clash where three pole vaulters com­peted in dif­fer­ent coun­tries via Zoom”.</p>
    <p>Amaz­ing, re­sponded Poh, was “how much men­tal grit ath­letes need to have”. From the out­side we might see an ath­lete’s mus­cles, but strength this year lay on the in­side.</p>
    <p>“Four years,” she said in ref­er­ence to the Olympics, “is a looooong time to train fer­vently for some­thing. But how bru­tal it is on the mind when the four years be­comes rub­ber band-time.” When the Olympics stretch to five years, ath­letes have to rene­go­ti­ate jobs, stud­ies, fund­ing, take a breath and con­tinue. “It’s not phys­i­cal strength that builds the ath­lete,” she clar­i­fies.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, I asked what part of them­selves th­ese ath­letes had im­proved. “Pa­tience,” said Berthier about what she de­vel­oped as time slid by. “My diet,” said Yip. An abil­ity to “jug­gle more”, said Poh, who was row­ing and nurs­ing and went from an ath­lete who got anx­ious if her meal times were changed to one who could “multi-fo­cus”.</p>
    <p>For Neo, progress was found in her “adapt­abil­ity”. In a lock­down world of no phys­i­cal meet­ings, fine-tun­ing in a tech­ni­cal sport which is ob­sessed with per­fec­tion meant a video call. “It was chal­leng­ing as it wasn’t as easy for</p>
    <p>Ath­letes, quite beau­ti­fully, were mostly amazed by each other. In­spired by the re­silience they saw. Im­pressed by the drive they found. In a way they were all lift­ing each other out of dis­tress. Amaz­ing, said swim­mer Yip Pin Xiu, was “ath­letes still train­ing and ev­ery­one still do­ing their best even if no com­pe­ti­tion was in sight”.</p>
    <p>the coaches and phys­i­cal train­ers to cor­rect our mis­takes over Zoom”, she said. But from im­pro­vi­sa­tion came im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>You hope the ath­letic world re­opens fully for ath­letes need to take their en­ergy some­where. But till then they have to keep work­ing be­cause in this new year it’s pos­si­ble they’re go­ing to be asked to make a ma­jor leap up­wards.</p>
    <p>From very lit­tle com­pe­ti­tion to the Olympics. From liv­ing room squats to hero­ics on the big stage. It’s a pretty big jump but at least diver Jonathan Chan is on the rise.</p>
    <p>“(This year) I man­aged,” he said, “to do 12 triple skips in a row.” Which if you’re won­der­ing is the rope pass­ing un­der the feet three times in a sin­gle jump.</p>
    <p>Im­pres­sive, kid. But bet­ter start work­ing on 13.</p>
