    <p>Trav­ellers who have been vac­ci­nated against Covid-19 may avoid hav­ing to serve a lengthy stay-home no­tice (SHN) when they re­turn to Sin­ga­pore in the fu­ture, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong has sug­gested.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry coro­n­avirus task force, said the Gov­ern­ment would con­sider dras­ti­cally re­duc­ing or even do­ing away with the twoweek quar­an­tine re­quire­ment if data shows vac­ci­na­tion sig­nif­i­cantly re­duces trans­mis­sion risks.</p>
    <p>He said this was one of the po­ten­tial “tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits” for those choos­ing to be vac­ci­nated, be­sides pro­tec­tion against the virus. “Those who choose not to be vac­ci­nated, you have to live with more fre­quent tests, you have to live with quar­an­tine, you have to live with all of these other ad­di­tional re­quire­ments,” he said on Thurs­day in an in­ter­view on CNA’s Talk­ing Point.</p>
    <p>“If you have the vac­ci­na­tion, you travel to a high-risk place, you come back, can that SHN be short­ened, or even done away with com­pletely? That is the big ques­tion,” said Mr Wong. “We still don’t know the ex­tent to which a vac­ci­na­tion can com­pletely – or how sig­nif­i­cantly – help re­duce trans­mis­sion risk. So, those stud­ies are still pend­ing. If in­deed the data shows that trans­mis­sion risks can come down sig­nif­i­cantly with vac­ci­na­tion, then cer­tainly, we will con­sider re­duc­ing dras­ti­cally the SHN or even do­ing away with it.”</p>
    <p>Be­ing vac­ci­nated may also make it pos­si­ble to travel abroad more freely, de­pend­ing on the re­quire­ments in other coun­tries, Mr Wong noted. “Even with­out a vac­cine to­day, many Sin­ga­pore­ans can al­ready travel freely to other coun­tries with­out a quar­an­tine there be­cause they re­gard Sin­ga­pore­ans as com­ing from a lowrisk ju­ris­dic­tion,” said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“I think with a vac­ci­na­tion, it will cer­tainly help, but those are reg­u­la­tions that are out­side of our con­trol.”</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sion, hosted by CNA pre­sen­ter Steven Chia, also fea­tured As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ver­non Lee, di­rec­tor of the com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases di­vi­sion at the Min­istry of Health, and As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ben­jamin Ong, who chairs the ex­pert com­mit­tee on Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion con­vened by the MOH.</p>
    <p>Prof Lee de­bunked a num­ber of ru­mours about the vac­cine, in­clud­ing one that it can cause cancer.</p>
    <p>“At this point, there is no ev­i­dence that this vac­cine will re­sult in such a side ef­fect,” he said in re­sponse to a ques­tion from a viewer. He added that most of the known side ef­fects are mild, but the vac­cine can cause se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions in some peo­ple. The mes­sen­ger RNA used in the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine, cur­rently the only one be­ing ad­min­is­tered here, also does not in­cor­po­rate it­self into hu­man DNA, Prof Lee noted. “In fact, af­ter about 48 hours, it just dis­si­pates in the body and it dis­in­te­grates, so there is no ev­i­dence at this point that there is any such con­cern,” he said of the cancer ru­mour.</p>
    <p>There is also no ev­i­dence that a pa­tient who re­ceives the vac­cine will have dif­fi­culty get­ting preg­nant, Prof Lee said in re­sponse to an­other ques­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Ong said the like­li­hood that the vac­cine will cause long-term is­sues is “very re­mote”. Nonethe­less, he said the ex­pert com­mit­tee de­cided to play it safe and has rec­om­mended preg­nant women should wait un­til af­ter they have given birth be­fore be­ing vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Asked about the new strain of the virus that has emerged in Bri­tain and spread to var­i­ous coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, Prof Ong said mu­ta­tions oc­cur all the time, adding that the vac­cine is likely to still work on the new strain. This is be­cause the mu­tated virus fea­tures the same spike pro­tein as the ear­lier strain.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has also pur­chased a vac­cine de­vel­oped by US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Moderna, which sim­i­larly uses mRNA tech­nol­ogy to in­tro­duce the ge­netic code to the body to pro­duce a piece of the coro­n­avirus known as a spike pro­tein, thereby help­ing the pa­tient’s cells recog­nise and de­velop an im­mune re­sponse to Covid-19. The Re­pub­lic has also bought stocks of a more tra­di­tional in­ac­ti­vated virus vac­cine pro­duced by China’s Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said Sin­ga­pore had to make “early bets” on these vac­cines as long ago as last April, be­fore there was ex­ten­sive clin­i­cal data on their ef­fi­cacy, to en­sure Sin­ga­pore would be near the front of the queue.</p>
