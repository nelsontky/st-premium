    <p>An In­done­sian woman has been sen­tenced to five months’ jail af­ter ad­mit­ting in a district court yes­ter­day that she had aban­doned her new­born baby boy in a pri­vate es­tate near Up­per Paya Le­bar Road on July 27.</p>
    <p>The in­fant was dis­cov­ered in a re­cy­cling bin in Tai Keng Gar­dens. He was taken to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal, where he was found to be in a sta­ble con­di­tion with no vis­i­ble in­juries.</p>
    <p>At the time of the of­fence, the 29-year-old of­fender was work­ing as a maid. The court heard that she had de­vel­oped a re­la­tion­ship with a Bangladesh­i man in 2018, and dis­cov­ered she was preg­nant ear­lier this year. She wanted to ter­mi­nate the preg­nancy and took pills to end it, but this did not work.</p>
    <p>On July 27, the woman, who can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der, felt con­trac­tions and gave birth in a bath­room in her em­ployer’s home around 1pm. The ad­dress was not dis­closed.</p>
    <p>Af­ter cut­ting the um­bil­i­cal cord with a pair of scis­sors, she wrapped the in­fant in a towel and put him in a pa­per bag. She then placed the baby in­side a re­cy­cling bin and propped up the lid so air could en­ter the bin.</p>
    <p>Some time later, a res­i­dent of the es­tate heard the baby cry­ing. The Straits Times in July spoke to a man whose son-in-law heard the in­fant cry­ing shortly af­ter a fam­ily din­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Lew, who de­clined to give his full name, said of his son-in-law: “He heard a strange noise com­ing from (the bin), and asked some of us for help to check it out. No one dared to open the bin be­cause they thought it might be a cat or a dog, so they called me for help.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter lift­ing the lid, he spot­ted the in­fant. The po­lice were also alerted. Mr Lew’s fam­ily took the baby out of the bin, and an am­bu­lance ar­rived soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier state­ment, po­lice said they had iden­ti­fied the woman through ex­ten­sive ground in­ves­ti­ga­tions and with the aid of im­ages from closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage pro­vided by res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>For aban­don­ing a child, the woman could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined.</p>
