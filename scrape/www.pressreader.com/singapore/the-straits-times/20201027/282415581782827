    <p>DA:NS FES­TI­VAL</p>
    <p>Es­planade – The­atres on the Bay Oct 16 to 25</p>
    <p>This year, Es­planade’s an­nual da:ns fes­ti­val took a turn for the dig­i­tal, with the on­go­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion hav­ing ne­ces­si­tated a re-imag­in­ing of the fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>As pro­gram­mer Iris Che­ung men­tions in her fes­ti­val mes­sage, “con­cepts of space and move­ment have been deeply al­tered and rede­fined” by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing the fes­ti­val, which runs un­til this Satur­day, fully on­line chal­lenges the very mean­ing of “space” in an art form of­ten in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked with the ex­pe­ri­ence of a shared phys­i­cal space.</p>
    <p>Some works made strong use of the dig­i­tal medium to ques­tion space and move­ment, but it was chiefly the loss of phys­i­cal per­for­mance that was keenly felt through­out the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>This was es­pe­cially the case with Ber­lin-based Sin­ga­porean dance artist Ming Poon’s fes­ti­val com­mis­sion, The In­ter­ven­tion Of Lone­li­ness (Lock­down Edi­tion), a Zoom­based per­for­mance de­vel­oped from the live ver­sion held i n the Es­planade’s An­nexe Stu­dio for last year’s da:ns fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Poon, the lone image on screen, held up a sign en­treat­ing the hid­den au­di­ence to slow dance with him. If you re­sponded by turn­ing on your cam­era, he would ask you to strate­gise with him how you might “dance to­gether” on-screen.</p>
    <p>He in­ter­spersed the slow danc­ing with re­flec­tions on the ef­fect the lock­down has had on him and what he missed about be­ing in phys­i­cal con­tact with an­other, fore­most be­ing the per­son’s smell.</p>
    <p>Pairs of the au­di­ence left the main Zoom room to “slow dance” to­gether in break-out rooms. If you were not one of them, you could watch by vis­it­ing the rooms. Some rooms spon­ta­neously be­came dance par­ties for all who vis­ited, with ca­ma­raderie that lasted the span of a song.</p>
    <p>The work vis­cer­ally evoked the awk­ward­ness of try­ing to con­nect with an­other per­son when sep­a­rated by a screen.</p>
    <p>An­other work that ef­fec­tively used the on­line medium was Fail­ing The Dance: A Dou­ble Bill Of Lec­ture-Demon­stra­tions by Soul­tari Amin Farid and Nir­mala Se­shadri, which jux­ta­posed per­for­mance archival and film footage with their lec­ture per­for­mances in a con­fla­tion of times and spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Their strug­gles with the ex­pec­ta­tions placed on them as prac­ti­tion­ers of tra­di­tional Malay dance and bharatanat­yam, as well as the re­jec­tion they ex­pe­ri­enced when they tried to push the bound­aries of these forms, were pal­pa­ble through the pain in their voices and the hurt in their eyes, mag­ni­fied on screen.</p>
    <p>The show­case Open Call in­vited lo­cal artists to sub­mit pro­pos­als for short works.</p>
    <p>Of the seven works pre­sented, the most en­gag­ing ones made use of cam­era an­gles and close-ups to show move­ment in ways im­per­cep­ti­ble in a face-to-face per­for­mance, or to evoke a spe­cific, in­ti­mate spa­tial re­la­tion­ship with the au­di­ence, be­yond a straight­for­ward record­ing of live danc­ing.</p>
    <p>Unison by Ber­nice Lee and Adele Goh, for ex­am­ple, was per­formed against a white back­ground so bright that the dancers ap­peared to be float­ing in a void, rem­i­nis­cent of early car­toon an­i­ma­tions. This set­ting, to­gether with the light pi­ano mu­sic, per­fectly sup­ported the dancers’ quirky in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>In I Went For A Walk And Took With Me… by Dapheny Chen and See Joo Teng, the cam­era framed Chen’s body and pre­cise move­ments con­tin­u­ously at eye level, fol­low­ing her such that her inces­sant plac­ing and re­plac­ing of ping pong balls on a ta­ble of re­flec­tive black acrylic high­lighted the pre­car­i­ous­ness of their still­ness.</p>
    <p>Art Nam­ing’s You Are Fac­ing Your­self You Are Fac­ing Me was live-streamed, but a record­ing of the stream was avail­able for view­ing as the last piece in Open Call.</p>
    <p>In it, the artist sat in front of a we­b­cam, barely mov­ing and at in­ter­vals typed dif­fer­ent it­er­a­tions of the words “what am I fac­ing” into the chat.</p>
    <p>It was a bril­liant close to the event, cheek­ily throw­ing all that had come be­fore into dis­ar­ray, open­ing up more ques­tions than an­swers around what move­ment and space are.</p>
    <p>As a dig­i­tal fes­ti­val, da:ns made some com­pro­mises with works that did not fully ac­knowl­edge the strengths and lim­i­ta­tions of the screen medium, but it also made a strong state­ment about the im­por­tance of ex­pe­ri­enc­ing dance live in a space to­gether.</p>
    <p>One hopes that one will be do­ing just that at next year’s fes­ti­val.</p>
