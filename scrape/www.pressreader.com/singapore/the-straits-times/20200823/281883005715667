    <p>A hot­line set up in April to pro­vide psy­cho­log­i­cal and emo­tional sup­port to peo­ple amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic will no longer be oper­at­ing 24 hours daily from Sept 1, after a de­cline in mid­dle-of-the-night calls.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said that over 27,900 calls have been made to the Na­tional Care Hot­line since it be­gan op­er­a­tions on April 10 amid the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of calls de­creased by about 42 per cent after the cir­cuit breaker ended in early June, he said. Calls re­ceived from mid­night to 8am have also de­clined.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos said that from Sept 1, the hot­line will op­er­ate from 8am to mid­night daily.</p>
    <p>The change also comes as some of the vol­un­teers who man the hot­line, num­ber­ing around 900, have re­sumed work and other com­mit­ments dur­ing the sec­ond phase of the re­open­ing of the econ­omy and are not able to take on as many shifts as be­fore.</p>
    <p>“These re­vised oper­at­ing hours will help us to con­tinue to meet the needs of most of our call­ers while op­ti­mis­ing our vol­un­teer pool,” said Mr Masa­gos.</p>
    <p>Those who need sup­port after mid­night and call the hot­line will be greeted by an in­ter­ac­tive voice record­ing, he added. The record­ing will guide the call­ers to con­tact 24-hour cri­sis hot­lines such as the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health’s helpline and the Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore’s hot­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos also thanked the hot­line vol­un­teers for self­lessly pro­vid­ing psy­cho­log­i­cal and emo­tional sup­port to mem­bers of the pub­lic who called in.</p>
    <p>Most of the call­ers were adults above 21 years old, and their top con­cerns per­tained to men­tal health, as well as mar­i­tal and fam­ily dis­putes, he said.</p>
    <p>The hot­line ini­tia­tive is still re­cruit­ing vol­un­teers. Trained men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als equipped with psy­cho­log­i­cal first aid skills and have cri­sis in­ter­ven­tion ex­pe­ri­ence can sign up at https://go.gov.sg/nchvol­un­teer.</p>
