    <p>Given the un­cer­tainty over how travel de­mand pat­terns will evolve amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) has said it will con­tinue with its cur­rent cap on ve­hi­cle pop­u­la­tion growth.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent growth cap – at 0.25 per cent a year for com­mer­cial ve­hi­cles and 0 per cent for all oth­ers – was due to ex­pire by the end of this cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) quota year next Jan­uary. But the LTA said yesterday that it will con­tinue with the growth cap un­til Jan 31, 2022.</p>
    <p>It said the growth cap en­sures that “our ve­hi­cle pop­u­la­tion growth is tem­pered and sup­ports the de­vel­op­ment of a sus­tain­able and live­able en­vi­ron­ment for Sin­ga­pore­ans”.</p>
    <p>It added that the ex­ten­sion of the cur­rent ve­hi­cle growth cap will not have any im­pact on the sup­ply of COEs, as the COE quota is de­ter­mined largely by the num­ber of ve­hi­cle dereg­is­tra­tions.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said on Face­book that Covid-19 has “changed the way we travel, as more of us work from home, par­tic­i­pate in on­line learn­ing, and gen­er­ally stay at home more”.</p>
    <p>He noted that “more have taken to healthy modes such as cycling”.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said “we should take the op­por­tu­nity to re­duce un­nec­es­sary trips, stag­ger work­ing hours, and de­velop a more sus­tain­able land trans­port sys­tem for Sin­ga­pore­ans – one that is greener, smarter and more in­clu­sive in meet­ing the di­verse needs of com­muters”.</p>
    <p>He said the LTA will re­view the ve­hi­cle growth rate next year, with the new cap to take ef­fect from Fe­bru­ary 2022.</p>
    <p>“I hope this also pro­vides some sta­bil­ity and as­sur­ance for ve­hi­cle own­ers, busi­nesses and deal­ers in the months ahead,” he added.</p>
    <p>The ve­hi­cle growth cap was at 3 per cent a year in the first half of the 30-year-old COE sys­tem.</p>
    <p>There­after, it was grad­u­ally re­vised down­wards, un­til it reached 0 per cent for cars two years ago.</p>
