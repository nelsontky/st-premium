    <p>• Kyr­gyzs­tan voted in a par­lia­men­tary elec­tion yes­ter­day that will test Pres­i­dent Sooron­bai Jeen­bekov’s po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal and his abil­ity to forge new al­liances amid the worst eco­nomic cri­sis in two decades.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeen­bekov’s sup­port­ers look likely to win a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of seats in the leg­is­la­ture in the Cen­tral Asian coun­try, but the cur­rent pro-pres­i­den­tial rul­ing coali­tion is cer­tain to be up­set due to in­ter­nal splits in the two ma­jor po­lit­i­cal groups and wide­spread voter dis­con­tent.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign has been marred by al­le­ga­tions of vote-buy­ing, and an Au­gust opinion poll or­dered by the United States-backed In­ter­na­tional Repub­li­can In­sti­tute showed that 15 per cent of re­spon­dents favoured the idea of vot­ing against all par­ties.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 16 par­ties are con­test­ing 120 seats in the sin­gle-cham­ber Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>If none of them wins more votes than the “Against all” op­tion, a new elec­tion would have to be called.</p>
    <p>The coun­try of 6.5 mil­lion peo­ple has a his­tory of po­lit­i­cal tur­moil: In the past 15 years, two pres­i­dents have been top­pled by re­volts and a third is in prison af­ter fall­ing out with his suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther in­sta­bil­ity would be a con­cern to close ally Rus­sia. Moscow op­er­ates a mil­i­tary air­base in the for­mer Soviet re­pub­lic, and is al­ready deal­ing with ma­jor crises in­volv­ing its al­lies Be­larus and Ar­me­nia, as well as its own is­sues around the sus­pected poi­son­ing of op­po­si­tion leader Alexei Navalny.</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers say the cam­paign pro­mot­ing vot­ing against all par­ties is in fact a ploy by the wealth­i­est par­ties, who would be able to out­spend smaller com­peti­tors in a re­run.</p>
    <p>The So­cial Demo­cratic party of Kyr­gyzs­tan (SDPK), which dom­i­nated the pre­vi­ous elec­tion in 2015 and served as the core of the pro-pres­i­den­tial coali­tion, has split af­ter a rift be­tween Mr Jeen­bekov and his pre­de­ces­sor Al­mazbek Atam­bayev.</p>
    <p>An­other ma­jor coali­tion mem­ber, Re­spub­lika–Ata Zhurt, which to­gether with SDPK won more than half the seats in the pre­vi­ous elec­tion, has also split.</p>
    <p>Some of its MPs will seek re-elec­tion on a dif­fer­ent party’s ticket.</p>
    <p>Some of Mr Jeen­bekov’s clos­est al­lies in­clud­ing his brother are now run­ning for Par­lia­ment un­der the flag of the Bir­imdik (Unity) party.</p>
    <p>But that party’s leader, Mr Marat Amankulov, faced a bar­rage of crit­i­cism last month over com­ments in which he called for closer in­te­gra­tion with Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>He said the re­marks were taken out of con­text. Last week, Mr Jeen­bekov trav­elled to meet Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, who as­sured him of Moscow’s sup­port.</p>
    <p>Re­sults of the elec­tion are likely to be known by yes­ter­day evening lo­cal time or to­day, but given the frac­tured na­ture of the par­ties, it could be days or weeks be­fore a gov­ern­ment is formed.</p>
