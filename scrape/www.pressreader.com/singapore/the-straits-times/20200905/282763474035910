    <p>One of the most fa­mous cars in Ger­man car­maker Mercedes-Benz’s sta­ble is the gar­gan­tuan G-wagon, which is short for Ge­landewa­gen (Ger­man for off-road ve­hi­cle).</p>
    <p>At the other end of the scale is the baby G – the GLA – which was Mercedes’ first com­pact cross­over launched in 2014.</p>
    <p>The first-gen­er­a­tion GLA had two de­sir­able traits: the cov­eted three-pointed star and the shape of a cross­over that buy­ers can­not seem to get enough of.</p>
    <p>The se­cond-gen­er­a­tion GLA in­her­its its pre­de­ces­sor’s recipe for de­sir­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>While Mercedes-Benz may use the GL pre­fix for its sport util­ity ve­hi­cles, it does not mat­ter to most buy­ers that the GLA can­not ac­tu­ally go off-road. There is a four-wheel-drive ver­sion, but it is not avail­able here.</p>
    <p>The new GLA is 14mm shorter in length (4,410mm ver­sus 4,424mm), but 30mm longer in wheel­base (2,729mm ver­sus 2,699mm) and 30mm wider (1,834mm ver­sus 1,804mm). It also gains a sig­nif­i­cant 104mm in height, over its pre­de­ces­sor’s 1,507mm.</p>
    <p>I park the test-car next to a first­gen­er­a­tion GLA and it is ob­vi­ous the new car has a stronger all-round pres­ence.</p>
    <p>This adds one more tick to its de­sir­abil­ity: It gets no­ticed more than its pre­de­ces­sor, which, for some buy­ers, is the point of buying a Mercedes-Benz.</p>
    <p>In­side, the new GLA ad­dresses a com­mon grouse about the pre­vi­ous car – the lack of space.</p>
    <p>There is more el­bow and shoul­der room, while legroom for rear pas­sen­gers has in­creased by 116mm. But the rear seats are still meant for two adults and one child.</p>
    <p>The boot re­mains small­ish at 435 litres. It is 14 litres larger than be­fore, but still smaller than the BMW X1’s 505-litre stowage.</p>
    <p>These gains in in­te­rior space do not turn the GLA200 into a fam­ily car, but make it more us­able for fam­i­lies with two young chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The cock­pit has un­der­gone a dra­matic makeover. Gone are the but­tons on the in­fo­tain­ment con­sole and in­stru­ment dis­play clus­ter. In their place are two 10.25-inch in­stru­ment and me­dia dis­plays.</p>
    <p>The cock­pit is iden­ti­cal to the Aclass’, in­clud­ing the in­tu­itive “Hey Mercedes” voice com­mand.</p>
    <p>Fully dig­i­tal in­stru­ment dis­plays are the rage among premium car brands, and Mercedes has done well in in­te­grat­ing the screens.</p>
    <p>Un­der the bon­net lies a 1.3-litre tur­bocharged en­gine co-de­vel­oped with Re­nault. It is the same en­gine found in the A200 hatch and sedan.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with its pre­de­ces­sor, the new GLA does not have a sig­nif­i­cant per­for­mance gain. It is 0.1 seconds quicker in the cen­tury sprint, but has a lower top speed (210kmh ver­sus 215kmh). These dif­fer­ences do not mat­ter in daily driv­ing.</p>
    <p>Its of­fi­cial fuel con­sump­tion inches up from 5.9 litres to 6.1 litres/100km. Over a three-day test drive cov­er­ing 135km, the GLA200 clocks 8 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>Some driv­ers have mixed views of the 1.3-litre power plant, but I have driven the A200 and Re­nault’s facelifted Kad­jar – both pow­ered by the same en­gine – and the power plant does not dis­ap­point.</p>
    <p>The small en­gine punches above its weight. Power de­liv­ery is smooth, even though it drones at higher en­gine speeds.</p>
    <p>The GLA is a small, stylish and ef­fort­less car, mak­ing it a per­fect starter-Merc for the city.</p>
    <p>But for folks who en­joy driv­ing en­thu­si­as­ti­cally, the GLA will ap­pear too pli­ant, pre­dictable and even clin­i­cal.</p>
    <p>But the baby G can­not be ev­ery­thing to ev­ery­one – it will just have to find its own path as it grows up.</p>
