    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Pop star Brit­ney Spears has sought to re­as­sure fans con­cerned for her men­tal health, say­ing she is “the hap­pi­est I’ve ever been”.</p>
    <p>Spears, 38, whose busi­ness and per­sonal af­fairs are con­trolled by her fa­ther Jamie Spears, posted an Instagram video i n which she ad­dressed per­sis­tent re­ports that she was not do­ing well.</p>
    <p>“I know that there have been a lot of com­ments and a lot of peo­ple say­ing a lot of dif­fer­ent things about me, but I just want to let you guys know that I am fine,” the singer said i n the video on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>A small but vo­cal group of fans has launched a #FreeBrit­ney cam­paign that seeks to end a court-or­dered con­ser­va­tor­ship that was put in place about 12 years ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Spears was ap­pointed con­ser­va­tor in 2008 after the pop star was hos­pi­talised for psy­chi­atric treat­ment. The singer’s care man­ager Jodi Mont­gomery took over in a tem­po­rary ca­pac­ity late last year when Mr Spears suf­fered a bout of ill health.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Spears asked for Ms Mont­gomery to per­ma­nently re­place her fa­ther as her con­ser­va­tor, but a closed-door court hear­ing ex­tended the cur­rent ar­range­ments un­til Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers of the #FreeBrit­ney cam­paign be­lieve Spears is be­ing kept pris­oner in her Los An­ge­les area home and that she is send­ing cryptic sig­nals beg­ging to be freed through her so­cial me­dia ac­counts, which usu­ally con­sist of self­ies or danc­ing.</p>
    <p>Other fans have ex­pressed alarm about re­peated Instagram post­ings of the same photos, ap­par­ently taken years ago.</p>
    <p>Spears – known for hits in­clud­ing Toxic, (You Drive Me) Crazy and ...Baby One More Time – re­vived her pop ca­reer after her break­down, but she pulled out of a Las Ve­gas con­cert res­i­dency last year and briefly en­tered a men­tal health fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>She has not per­formed pub­licly since Oc­to­ber 2018.</p>
