    <p>Hong Kongers rushed to buy pro-democ­racy news­pa­per Ap­ple Daily yes­ter­day, in a show of sup­port for its owner Jimmy Lai, who was ar­rested a day ear­lier as po­lice rounded up crit­ics of China un­der a new se­cu­rity law. More than 500,000 copies were printed, com­pared with the usual 100,000, the pa­per said on its web­site. WORLD</p>
    <p>China’s top law­mak­ers yes­ter­day agreed to ex­tend the term of Hong Kong’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (LegCo) by at least a year, putting an end to a leg­isla­tive vac­uum in the ter­ri­tory, state me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>LegCo elec­tions were ini­tially sched­uled for Sept 6, but were post­poned by a year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter Sept 30, 2020, the sixth Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil of (Hong Kong) will con­tinue to per­form its du­ties for no less than one year un­til the be­gin­ning of the term of the sev­enth Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil of Hong Kong,” the National Peo­ple’s Congress Stand­ing Com­mit­tee (NPCSC) said at the end of its four­day meet­ing, the of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam had on July 31 used a colo­nial-era emer­gency law to post­pone the elec­tion to Sept 5 next year, cit­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The city yes­ter­day re­ported 33 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, a marked drop from the spike in num­bers in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion by the NPCSC was wel­comed by the Cabi­net-level Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice (HKMAO) and Beijing’s li­ai­son of­fice in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>It shows the cen­tral gov­ern­ment and 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple of China “have al­ways cared for, cher­ished and been the most con­sid­er­ate to­wards Hong Kong”, the HKMAO said, ac­cord­ing to Xin­hua.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral gov­ern­ment’s Hong Kong li­ai­son of­fice said the de­ci­sion en­sures so­ci­ety con­cen­trates on get­ting the coro­n­avirus out­break un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam ex­pressed grat­i­tude to the NPCSC for its de­ci­sion, say­ing that it puts an end to a pos­si­ble leg­isla­tive vac­uum in the city should the LegCo be dis­solved be­fore a new one is elected.</p>
    <p>“(The de­ci­sion) not only main­tains the con­sti­tu­tional and le­gal or­der of the HKSAR (Hong Kong Spe­cial Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­gion), but also en­sures the nor­mal gov­er­nance of the HKSAR gov­ern­ment and the nor­mal op­er­a­tion of so­ci­ety,” she said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“It demon­strates once again the care and sup­port of the cen­tral gov­ern­ment for the HKSAR.”</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion, how­ever, did not touch on whether the four op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers barred from stand­ing in the next elec­tions will still be al­lowed to keep their cur­rent seats.</p>
    <p>They had been dis­qual­i­fied from run­ning af­ter elec­tion of­fi­cials said their calls for for­eign gov­ern­ments to im­pose sanc­tions on Beijing and Hong Kong had vi­o­lated the new national se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>On Aug 3, the city’s only NPCSC rep­re­sen­ta­tive, Mr Tam Yiu Chung, told a ra­dio pro­gramme that it is con­tra­dic­tory to al­low the four law­mak­ers to keep their seats if they were barred by elec­tion of­fi­cials from stand­ing in the Sept 6 polls.</p>
    <p>His com­ments come as Hong Kong reels from the ef­fects of the sweep­ing national se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion un­der which ty­coon Jimmy Lai, pub­lisher of the Ap­ple Daily news­pa­per, as well as nine other peo­ple were ar­rested on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The law – im­posed on June 30, just over a year af­ter protests first rocked the city – has dealt a body blow to the pro-democ­racy move­ment. It has also drawn con­dem­na­tion from the West, with US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo call­ing Lai a “pa­triot” on Mon­day and say­ing his ar­rest showed Beijing had “evis­cer­ated” Hong Kong’s free­doms and eroded the rights of its peo­ple. Beijing has of­ten re­ferred to Lai as a “traitor”.</p>
    <p>With the new se­cu­rity law, any­thing Beijing con­sid­ers se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism or col­lu­sion with for­eign forces can be pun­ished, with the max­i­mum sen­tence be­ing life im­pris­on­ment.</p>
