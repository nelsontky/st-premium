    <p>The pe­tite woman is of­ten spot­ted apron-clad at a cof­fee shop at Block 75, Toa Payoh Lorong 5, busy clear­ing glasses and tak­ing or­ders. The drinks stall owner chats eas­ily with cus­tomers, but this merely masks the disquiet Madam Ang Goon Lay, 65, struggles with.</p>
    <p>It has been nearly 26 years since her seven-year-old daugh­ter Lim Shiow Rong was raped and stran­gled, and the mur­derer has not been caught.</p>
    <p>On June 24, 1995, Shiow Rong told her mother she was off to see “papa’s friend” and ran off while Madam Ang was busy at the cof­fee shop, which used to be owned by her hus­band.</p>
    <p>That was the last time she saw her daugh­ter alive.</p>
    <p>Madam Ang’s sec­ond daugh­ter,</p>
    <p>Ms Lim Jia Hui, 27, has now made it her mis­sion to find her sis­ter’s killer to help her mother find clo­sure.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia yes­ter­day at the cof­fee shop, Ms Lim, who works at a cus­tomer ser­vice call cen­tre, said: “My mum lives in guilt. She thinks that she didn’t take care of her daugh­ter well enough and blames her­self...</p>
    <p>“So this is why I want to find the mur­derer. I don’t want her to live in guilt.”</p>
    <p>Her hope of find­ing her sis­ter’s killer was re­newed when po­lice re­cently ar­rested a man for the mur­der of Feli­cia Teo, who had been miss­ing for 13 years.</p>
    <p>On Dec 17, 2020, Ah­mad Da­nial Mo­hamed Rafa’ee, 35, was charged with mur­der­ing Ms Teo, 19, at a Marine Ter­race flat in 2007. An­other man is at large for the crime.</p>
    <p>“If they man­aged to ar­rest some­one so many years later,” Ms Lim said, re­fer­ring to Ms Teo’s case, “hope­fully the po­lice can find who did this to my sis­ter. I be­lieve they can find some­thing with DNA and fin­ger­prints (since Shiow Rong) was beaten up”.</p>
    <p>Shiow Rong’s body was found the morn­ing after she went miss­ing, in a semi-sit­ting po­si­tion in a drain near Jalan Wood­bridge on June 25, 1995.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that she had been raped and stran­gled.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said that her fa­ther, Mr Lim Kim Siong, who was just one week into his jail sen­tence for drug-re­lated of­fences at the time of the in­ci­dent, also felt he was at blame. He died in 2016 from an ab­dom­i­nal aor­tic aneurysm.</p>
    <p>“After he come out of prison, he changed a lot. He stopped his drug habits and be­came a good fa­ther. He felt very guilty be­cause he thought it he did not pro­tect the fam­ily,” said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want this to be a re­gret if I am not able to find my sis­ter’s killer. I have to step up,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim re­called how her par­ents took ex­tra pre­cau­tions with her while she was grow­ing up be­cause of what hap­pened to her sis­ter.</p>
    <p>She stayed with a nanny un­til she was in Pri­mary 5, and was of­ten re­minded never to speak to strangers.</p>
    <p>De­spite these pre­cau­tions, Ms Lim re­called two in­ci­dents when she was in pri­mary school in which men she did not recog­nise ap­proached her, claim­ing to be her fa­ther’s friends.</p>
    <p>On one oc­ca­sion, she walked off with a man, but her aunt spot­ted her from a dis­tance and called out to her, caus­ing the man to flee.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim’s search for her sis­ter’s killer has en­tailed sift­ing through the Na­tional Li­brary ar­chives on­line, dig­ging up news­pa­per clip­pings of the in­ci­dent that her grand­mother has stored, study­ing a Crime­watch episode about her sis­ter’s case, as well as reach­ing out to Crime Li­brary Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Crime Li­brary Sin­ga­pore founder Joseph Tan, who helped Ms Lim con­tact the me­dia, said: “By mak­ing this case ap­peal, we hope to cast the net for in­for­ma­tion lead­ing to the ar­rest of the cul­prits for the po­lice to close this case.”</p>
