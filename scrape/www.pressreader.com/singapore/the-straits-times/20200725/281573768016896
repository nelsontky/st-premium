    <p>To combat the un­prece­dented dengue out­break this year, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency will be work­ing with town coun­cils on a two-week in­ten­sive is­land­wide vec­tor con­trol ex­er­cise. In­spec­tions and vec­tor con­trol oper­a­tions in com­mon ar­eas man­aged by town coun­cils will be stepped up.</p>
    <p>To combat the un­prece­dented dengue out­break this year, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) will be work­ing with town coun­cils on a two-week in­ten­sive is­land­wide vec­tor con­trol ex­er­cise, the agency an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In­spec­tions and vec­tor con­trol oper­a­tions in town coun­cil-man­aged com­mon ar­eas will be stepped up to en­sure drains are well-main­tained, ar­eas are kept lit­ter-free, and stag­nant wa­ter is re­moved or treated.</p>
    <p>NEA said Hous­ing Board es­tates ac­count for 45 per cent of ac­tive dengue clus­ters.</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cise will also in­clude chem­i­cal treat­ment – such as fog­ging, mist­ing and lar­vi­cid­ing – in dengue clus­ters to shrink the adult mos­quito pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary to June this year, NEA de­tected 50 per cent more Aedes mos­qui­toes in town coun­cil-man­aged ar­eas com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. There was also a 30 per cent in­crease in the mos­quito num­bers de­tected from May to June this year – co­in­cid­ing with the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod – com­pared with Fe­bru­ary and March.</p>
    <p>The re­duc­tion of land­scap­ing work and ces­sa­tion of most con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties, which ham­pered good house­keep­ing in con­struc­tion sites dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, were some fac­tors that wors­ened the dengue sit­u­a­tion, said NEA.</p>
    <p>MP for Mount­bat­ten Lim Biow Chuan said some key mea­sures his con­stituency will un­der­take over the next fort­night in­clude de­silt­ing and clean­ing drains, and oil­ing gully traps and drains con­tain­ing stag­nant wa­ter that can­not be re­moved.</p>
    <p>“We car­ried out fog­ging with NEA at Dakota Cres­cent and Balam Road es­tate” this week, said Mr Lim. “Next week, it will be done at Chai Chee and pro­gres­sively to other clus­ters.”</p>
    <p>Dakota Cres­cent, Balam Road and Chai Chee are dengue red zones.</p>
    <p>There have been close to 20,000 dengue cases this year, with a record 1,733 cases re­ported last week, the high­est num­ber of weekly dengue cases recorded in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of cases this year is ex­pected to ex­ceed the 22,170 re­ported in 2013, the high­est in his­tory, said NEA. Nine­teen peo­ple have died of dengue so far this year.</p>
    <p>Call­ing the ex­tent of the dengue out­break this year “very wor­ry­ing”, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources Amy Khor em­pha­sised the need for col­lec­tive and ur­gent com­mu­nity ef­forts to pre­vent the sit­u­a­tion from wors­en­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Khor was speak­ing to the me­dia on the side­lines of vec­tor con­trol oper­a­tions in Bukit Ba­tok West Av­enue 4 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The idea of the in­ten­sive is­land­wide ex­er­cise is to “re­duce the mos­quito pop­u­la­tion and break the chain of dengue transmissi­on so that we can flat­ten the curve, as it was to pre­vent the num­ber of dengue cases from es­ca­lat­ing again”, she said.</p>
    <p>As of Thurs­day, there were 424 ac­tive dengue clus­ters, with five large ones. The largest clus­ter in the Alju­nied-Gey­lang area has 276 cases. The Bukit Pan­jang Ring Road clus­ter is the sec­ond largest, with 272 cases.</p>
    <p>Some clus­ters, in­clud­ing the ones at Alju­nied Road-Gey­lang Road and the 258-case clus­ter at the Arthur Road area have faster rates of dis­ease transmissi­on, with an av­er­age of two or three cases re­ported daily over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Five clus­ters, in­clud­ing those at Woodleigh Close, Bi­dadari Park Drive/Woodleigh Link and Alkaff Cres­cent, are now closed.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the two-week ex­er­cise, NEA will work closely with grass­roots ad­vis­ers and vol­un­teers to ad­vise more res­i­dents to get rid of mos­quito-breed­ing habi­tats at home.</p>
    <p>As most peo­ple are work­ing from home, Dr Khor also re­minded res­i­dents liv­ing i n dengue-clus­ter ar­eas to spray in­sec­ti­cide in the dark cor­ners of their homes, ap­ply mos­quito re­pel­lent every three hours, and wear long sleeves and pants as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
