Special Thanks to: Rev Fr Simon Tan CSsR for his invaluable assistance, Dr Lim Hong Liang,
Nurses and Staff of PCC, Doctors and Nurses of Assisi Hospice, Dr Peter Hwang and his team at NNI for their exemplary dedication, care and support. The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he refreshes my soul.
He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake. Even though I walk through the darkest valley,
I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Psalm 23 Irene Tan nee Tay Lee Choo was called home to the Lord on 13 January 2021 Mother’s hold their children’s hands for a while, but their hearts forever. I truly never learned what the words I miss you’ were until I reached for my mom’s hand and it wasn’t there.
In life, we loved you dearly, in death we love you still. In our hearts you hold a place, no one else will ever fill. ‘ Dearly missed and lovingly cherished by: Tan Hek Koon, Elaine, Wilson, Wei Yi, family, friends and all loved ones.
