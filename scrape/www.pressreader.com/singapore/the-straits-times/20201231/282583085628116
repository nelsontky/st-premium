    <p>MI­AMI • The Mi­ami Heat are glad their re­match with the Mil­wau­kee Bucks comes just a day after their painful first clash.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day night, the Bucks set an Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) record by sink­ing 29 three­p­oint­ers en route to stomp­ing last sea­son’s los­ing fi­nal­ists 144-97.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one in our locker room would rather get to this (re­match than en­dure) a long prac­tice and film ses­sion,” Heat coach Erik Spoel­stra said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think any­body feels good about (Tues­day’s game). It hap­pened for a rea­son, and we don’t want to dis­re­gard that.”</p>
    <p>Spoel­stra hinted that the Bucks had viewed the first of back-to­back games as pay­back for Mi­ami’s elim­i­na­tion of Mil­wau­kee in five games in last sea­son’s Eastern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>“It was pretty clear they were play­ing at a dif­fer­ent ur­gency and in­ten­sity level,” Spoel­stra said of the Bucks. “It looked like they had been think­ing about this game for 80 days.”</p>
    <p>The Bucks shot 56.9 per cent from long dis­tance (29 of 51) and got three-point­ers from 12 play­ers.</p>
    <p>“Some days, the bas­ket­ball gods are with you a lit­tle bit,” said Mil­wau­kee coach Mike Bu­den­holzer, who did not re­alise his team had set the league record from long range un­til he was told by a re­porter after the game.</p>
    <p>“This was prob­a­bly just one of those nights for us.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, it was the most points ever al­lowed by the Heat in a home game, and the Bucks pro­duced their big­gest mar­gin of vic­tory in a road game.</p>
    <p>All-Star Khris Mid­dle­ton led Mil­wau­kee with 25 points while suc­ceed­ing on four of five three-point at­tempts.</p>
    <p>Off-sea­son ac­qui­si­tion Jrue Hol­i­day con­trib­uted 24 points and hit six of 10 from three-point range while Donte DiVin­cenzo scored 17 points and sank five of six from be­yond the arc.</p>
    <p>Such was the team’s hot hand that they could off­set a quiet night from Bucks All-Star for­ward Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo – the NBA’s two-time reign­ing Most Valu­able Player – who pro­vided nine points, six as­sists and six re­bounds.</p>
    <p>He was the only vis­it­ing player in the game who did not sink a three­p­ointer, go­ing zero-for-two, as his streak of 132 con­sec­u­tive games (reg­u­lar sea­son and post-sea­son) with dou­ble-fig­ure points ended.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami, play­ing with­out All-Star for­ward Jimmy But­ler be­cause of a sprained an­kle, got 23 points and seven as­sists from Tyler Herro.</p>
    <p>The guard made nine of 16 shots from the floor, in­clud­ing three of eight from three-point range, to pro­vide one of the few Heat bright spots.</p>
    <p>If Mi­ami want to find a pos­i­tive omen, they can look no fur­ther than the 1991-92 sea­son.</p>
    <p>On Dec 17, 1991, the Cleve­land Cava­liers blasted the vis­it­ing Heat 148-80. How­ever, the next night, Mi­ami beat the vis­it­ing In­di­ana Pac­ers 118-112 in over­time.</p>
    <p>Spoel­stra, though, knows his team have to de­fend much bet­ter for his­tory to re­peat.</p>
    <p>“Their first 15 three-point­ers were right in their wheel­house,” he said of the Bucks. “They didn’t feel us (de­fen­sively), and then they got on a roll. They put on a heck of a shoot­ing per­for­mance. They made us pay.”</p>
    <p>The Heat’s All-Star cen­tre Bam Ade­bayo was un­der­stand­ably de­jected after the game.</p>
    <p>“They made shots, and we had too many turnovers (21),” he said. “We didn’t come out with the in­ten­sity we usu­ally have.</p>
