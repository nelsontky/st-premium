    <p>Two cor­ner­men slated to be a part of One Cham­pi­onship’s In­side the Ma­trix event at the In­door Sta­dium tonight have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board and One an­nounced last night.</p>
    <p>How­ever, these have been de­ter­mined to be past in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The two, hail­ing from the United States and Rus­sia re­spec­tively, tested pos­i­tive on Tues­day. Prior to the pos­i­tive test, they had tested neg­a­tive be­fore fly­ing into Sin­ga­pore, and had also tested neg­a­tive upon ar­riv­ing.</p>
    <p>In a me­dia state­ment, STB and One said: “To de­ter­mine if their in­fec­tion is cur­rent, sero­log­i­cal tests were con­ducted for both in­di­vid­u­als on Oct 28, and their re­sults have come back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“The Min­istry of Health has de­ter­mined that these are past in­fec­tion cases, fol­low­ing epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“Re­cov­ered cases may con­tinue to shed non-vi­able, non-in­fec­tious vi­ral frag­ments for weeks or even months af­ter in­fec­tion, which may lead to pos­i­tive poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test re­sults.</p>
    <p>“As an added mea­sure, both men will be un­der­go­ing PCR tests again to­day. They will only be al­lowed to par­tic­i­pate in the event if their re­sults are neg­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>Sero­log­i­cal tests de­tect an­ti­bod­ies to Covid-19 from a blood sam­ple, as a marker of past in­fec­tion. Those with a pos­i­tive sero­log­i­cal test would have been in­fected in the past – at least 10 days ear­lier – and would no longer be in­fec­tious af­ter a pe­riod of iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The two in­di­vid­u­als are un­der­stood to be cor­ner­men of two mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) fight­ers set to fea­ture – top-billed com­peti­tor Aung La N Sang, and a se­cond uniden­ti­fied fighter who is not part of the event’s main six-bout card.</p>
    <p>In com­bat sport, cor­ner­men can be train­ers, coaches, cut­men, or</p>
    <p>HEALTH MIN­ISTRY’S FIND­INGS</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health has de­ter­mined that these are past in­fec­tion cases, fol­low­ing epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions. Re­cov­ered cases may con­tinue to shed non-vi­able, non-in­fec­tious vi­ral frag­ments for weeks or even months af­ter in­fec­tion, which may lead to pos­i­tive poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test re­sults. train­ing part­ners, and of­ten spend a lot of time in close prox­im­ity with their fighter.</p>
    <p>This could ex­plain the case of Aung La N Sang’s cor­ner­man. One’s light-heavy­weight and mid­dleweight world cham­pion, who is from Myan­mar but trains out of the United States, had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in July and is now re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>STB and One ex­plained that all for­eign-based ath­letes and pro­duc­tion crew mem­bers in­volved with In­side The Ma­trix must be tested four times – be­fore de­par­ture from their coun­try of ori­gin, on ar­rival, pre-fight and post-fight.</p>
    <p>They must also re­main in iso­la­tion un­til they re­ceive a neg­a­tive test re­sult, af­ter which they will fol­low a strictly con­trolled and pre-ap­proved itinerary.</p>
    <p>“Pub­lic health and safety re­main our top pri­or­ity,” they said in the state­ment. “These past in­fec­tions were de­tected through the screen­ing pro­to­cols and strin­gent mea­sures that were put in place to safe­guard the health of our lo­cal com­mu­nity as well as other ath­letes and pro­duc­tion crew mem­bers.”</p>
    <p>In­side The Ma­trix will be the first live sport event in Sin­ga­pore to fea­ture spec­ta­tors since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with 250 tick­ets snapped up within hours of go­ing on sale.</p>
    <p>The event comes three weeks af­ter One’s pre­vi­ous closed-door show, Reign of Dy­nas­ties, also held at the In­door Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>The events are part of a pi­lot project the Gov­ern­ment hopes will help iden­tify a model that can be widely im­ple­mented so that more large-scale events can re­sume safely in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>One’s founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Cha­tri Si­ty­o­d­tong had told ST on Mon­day that the same strin­gent mea­sures put in place for the Reign of Dy­nas­ties will be ad­hered to.</p>
    <p>Aside from the test­ing pro­to­cols, trav­el­ling for in­di­vid­u­als slated to be a part of the show was limited to the event’s “bub­ble” and ath­letes were not al­lowed to leave their rooms even when they tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Li­ai­son of­fi­cers ac­com­pa­nied ath­letes at all times, with train­ing al­lowed only at pri­vate des­ig­nated ar­eas within the ho­tel, and fight­ers had to fol­low strict sched­ules through an on­line book­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>For the event, at­ten­dees will be re­quired to un­dergo an Anti­gen Rapid Test (ART) at a des­ig­nated clinic on the day of the fight and pro­duce a valid neg­a­tive ART cer­tifi­cate be­fore they are al­lowed into the venue.</p>
    <p>ARTs re­turn re­sults in about half an hour, com­pared to the gold­stan­dard PCR which takes a few hours.</p>
    <p>In­side The Ma­trix is One’s big­gest event of the year, and will fea­ture six fights, four of which are world ti­tle bouts.</p>
