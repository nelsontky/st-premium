    <p>As glob­al­i­sa­tion beats a re­treat, China is re­fo­cus­ing its eco­nomic strat­egy to ac­com­mo­date the new re­al­ity. The changes that it makes could have far-reach­ing ef­fects for its trade part­ners and for­eign in­vestors and, most of all, for its own econ­omy and so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The new eco­nomic buzz phrase in China to­day is the “dual cir­cu­la­tion strat­egy”, which is be­ing men­tioned with grow­ing fre­quency in speeches by Chi­nese of­fi­cials, eco­nomic stud­ies and me­dia re­ports. The con­cept first ap­peared in the re­ports of a meet­ing of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s Polit­buro in May.</p>
    <p>It sounds con­fus­ing and has yet to be prop­erly fleshed out, which might hap­pen at the meet­ing of the party’s 370-mem­ber Cen­tral Com­mit­tee next month, which will lay the groundwork for China’s</p>
    <p>14th Five Year Plan from 2021 to 2025, of which the dual cir­cu­la­tion strat­egy is ex­pected to be the cen­tre­piece. In try­ing to de­code the strat­egy, schol­ars point out that “dual cir­cu­la­tion” refers to “in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion” and “ex­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>In­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion means do­mes­tic pro­duc­tion and con­sump­tion, while ex­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion refers to pro­duc­tion for ex­port. The con­sen­sus view is that China will tilt its poli­cies to favour more do­mes­ti­cally-driven growth.</p>
    <p>This would be a change of em­pha­sis from its heavy re­liance on ex­port markets over re­cent decades, espe­cially since it joined the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) in 2001.</p>
    <p>There has al­ready been some re­bal­anc­ing in re­cent years. China’s ex­ports ac­counted for 18 per cent of its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) last year – about half of its pro­por­tion in 2006. But the shift to even more do­mes­ti­cally-driven growth will now ac­cel­er­ate.</p>
    <p>THE RISE OF ILLIBERAL TRADE</p>
    <p>The ra­tio­nale for the change in fo­cus is un­der­stand­able. The lib­eral, rules-based trade or­der which has helped power China’s su­per­charged eco­nomic growth over the last 20 years is tot­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>The WTO, which is sup­posed to over­see the sys­tem, has been marginalis­ed, re­placed by a mus­cu­lar uni­lat­er­al­ism, espe­cially on the part of the United States, China’s largest ex­port mar­ket.</p>
    <p>China is also running into road­blocks in its trade and in­vest­ment re­la­tions with other pow­ers, in­clud­ing the Euro­pean Union, Aus­tralia and In­dia.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese com­pa­nies are com­ing un­der greater scru­tiny in ma­jor markets over­seas.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has fur­ther com­pli­cated these is­sues by prompt­ing calls from many coun­tries to re­duce re­liance on China as a source of sup­ply, espe­cially for “strate­gi­cally im­por­tant” prod­ucts. More­over, the pan­demic has dented de­mand in China’s big­gest over­seas markets, po­ten­tially re­duc­ing its prospects for ex­port growth. Trade fric­tions have also ex­posed some of the coun­try’s vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ac­tions taken, by the US in par­tic­u­lar, against Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies like Huawei – which can no longer eas­ily ob­tain the ad­vanced chips that it needs to pro­duce smart­phones and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions in­fra­struc­ture – have high­lighted China’s acute de­pen­dence on im­ports of semi­con­duc­tors espe­cially, an in­dus­try in which it is barely 15 per cent self-suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>So China can no longer take for granted the easy ac­cess to such core tech­nolo­gies that it has en­joyed up to now.</p>
    <p>It has no choice but to step up its do­mes­tic pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>One im­por­tant el­e­ment of China’s greater do­mes­tic ori­en­ta­tion go­ing for­ward will be to en­cour­age more high-value pro­duc­tion at home and re­duce its re­liance on im­ports of tech­nol­ogy from not only the US and Europe, but also from Ja­pan, South Korea and Tai­wan – al­though it will con­tinue to wel­come for­eign tech com­pa­nies to op­er­ate in China.</p>
    <p>It will also wel­come for­eign in­vest­ment in other ar­eas. It is strik­ing that even as other coun­tries are tight­en­ing in­vest­ment curbs on Chi­nese firms, Bei­jing is eas­ing rules for for­eign in­vestors, partly to pre­vent any mass ex­o­dus from China.</p>
    <p>In July, China’s of­fi­cial news agency Xin­hua reported that Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping had per­son­ally writ­ten to chief ex­ec­u­tives of for­eign firms as­sur­ing them of a “bet­ter busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment”. He added that “China will foster new op­por­tu­ni­ties and cre­ate new prospects for Chi­nese and for­eign en­ter­prises” and that for­eign com­pa­nies “have made the right choice to stay rooted in China”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has also fur­ther opened up its fi­nance and in­surance markets to for­eign in­vestors and re­cent sur­veys of for­eign com­pa­nies in China – such as the China Busi­ness Re­port re­leased by the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce on Sept 9 – re­veal that such firms be­lieve the reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment has im­proved.</p>
    <p>HUR­DLES TO ‘LO­CAL­I­SA­TION’</p>
    <p>How­ever, given the more do­mes­ti­cally-fo­cused ori­en­ta­tion of China’s poli­cies, some ob­servers think that for­eign com­pa­nies will need to in­creas­ingly pur­sue an “in China, for China” pol­icy.</p>
    <p>That is, they will need to shift from us­ing the coun­try as a pro­duc­tion base for ex­ports to cater­ing more to the lo­cal mar­ket, com­pet­ing with lo­cal com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>But for both for­eign and lo­cal com­pa­nies that have hith­erto con­cen­trated on ex­ports, piv­ot­ing to the do­mes­tic sec­tor would pose many chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>First, some ob­servers point out that re­fo­cus­ing China’s gi­gan­tic ex­port ma­chine on the lo­cal mar­ket is too much to ask.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mist Teng Tai, pres­i­dent of the Chi­nese think-tank Win­bro New Eco­nomic Think­ing In­sti­tute, was quoted as say­ing in a re­port in the state-owned Se­cu­ri­ties Times: “China makes 10 bil­lion hats, 10 bil­lion pairs of shoes, 30 bil­lion pieces of cloth­ing and 200 mil­lion tablets and por­ta­ble com­put­ers each year. It is not pos­si­ble to sell them all in the do­mes­tic mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies would also need to change their prod­ucts to cater to lo­cal tastes that are quite dif­fer­ent from those in their ex­port markets.</p>
    <p>An­other prob­lem is the coun­try’s in­come distri­bu­tion, which is highly skewed. French econ­o­mist Thomas Piketty found that the share of pre-tax in­come held by the rich­est 10 per cent of China’s pop­u­la­tion rose from 27 per cent in the late 1970s to 41 per cent by 2015, com­pa­ra­ble to the lev­els of in­equal­ity seen in the US.</p>
    <p>While Chine is reck­oned to have a 400 mil­lion-strong mid­dle class, and more than four mil­lion US-dol­lar mil­lion­aires, around 600 mil­lion peo­ple earn barely 1,000 yuan (S$200) a month, as re­vealed by Premier Li Ke­qiang at a press con­fer­ence in May.</p>
    <p>This is a ma­jor rea­son why the share of con­sump­tion in China’s GDP is only 38.8 per cent, com­pared with 66 per cent of GDP in the US. Pur­chas­ing power, espe­cially of lower-in­come work­ers, has been fur­ther eroded amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Shift­ing in­come, wealth and pur­chas­ing power in favour of poorer groups will need ma­jor re­forms – such as an ex­pan­sion of so­cial safety nets (so that peo­ple can save less and con­sume more).</p>
    <p>It will also need more re­sources be­ing di­rected to the pri­vate sec­tor, away from state en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists such as Ox­ford Univer­sity’s Ge­orge Mag­nus point out that this goes against the grain of cur­rent of­fi­cial pol­icy, which is to strengthen the state sec­tor.</p>
    <p>An­other prob­lem, flagged by Pek­ing Univer­sity’s pro­fes­sor of fi­nance Michael Pet­tis, is that there is a con­tra­dic­tion be­tween boost­ing do­mes­tic de­mand and grow­ing ex­ports. He noted that China’s ex­port com­pet­i­tive­ness is partly the re­sult of work­ers be­ing al­lo­cated a low share of the value of what they pro­duce. Boost­ing do­mes­tic con­sump­tion would re­quire them to get a much higher share. But that would un­der­mine ex­port com­pet­i­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>“For dual cir­cu­la­tion to work, in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion can only come at the ex­pense of in­ter­na­tional cir­cu­la­tion,” he pointed out.</p>
    <p>There is some ev­i­dence to back up this view. As China’s wages rose, espe­cially in its coastal prov­inces, many labour-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries such as gar­ments, toys and footwear be­came un­com­pet­i­tive and be­gan to move to lower-wage coun­tries such as Bangladesh, Cam­bo­dia and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>China could over­come the prob­lem of higher wages un­der­min­ing its ex­port com­pet­i­tive­ness if it were to shift to high-value pro­duc­tion on a mass scale, like Ja­pan, but that would take many years.</p>
    <p>It would seem there­fore that China’s shift to more do­mes­ti­cally-driven growth would, at best, be a grad­ual process.</p>
    <p>Its ex­port ma­chine will con­tinue to be crit­i­cal. But that, too, would need to ad­just to the new re­al­ity of more trade re­stric­tions and low growth in some of its big­gest ex­port markets, with lit­tle hope of pro­tec­tion from the WTO.</p>
    <p>ASEAN A PO­TEN­TIAL WIN­NER</p>
    <p>One bright spot though, could be Asean, where China’s ex­ports face near-zero tar­iffs and Chi­nese com­pa­nies are wel­come. Asean has al­ready be­come China’s largest trade part­ner this year.</p>
    <p>So ex­pect more in­vest­ment flow from China to Asean, as the coun­try moves fur­ther up the value chain and ex­its more low and mid-value in­dus­tries. Many Chi­nese pro­duc­ers in these in­dus­tries will shift op­er­a­tions to cheaper lo­ca­tions, many of which will be in Asean.</p>
    <p>Also, ex­pect China to more ur­gently push to wrap up the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship – a trade agree­ment in­volv­ing the 10 Asean mem­ber states plus Ja­pan,</p>
    <p>South Korea, Aus­tralia and New Zealand – which could be signed this year or early next year.</p>
    <p>As its reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment and pro­tec­tion of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights im­proves, China could even join the 11-na­tion Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, which is al­ready in force.</p>
    <p>While there is a ris­ing tide of de­glob­al­i­sa­tion in gen­eral, this is largely not hap­pen­ing in East Asia, where the mo­men­tum is more in the di­rec­tion of low­er­ing, rather than rais­ing, trade bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>This is pos­i­tive for the re­gion over the medium term, and would help keep China’s ex­port ma­chine hum­ming. That ma­chine would need to con­tinue play­ing a sig­nif­i­cant role in pow­er­ing China’s econ­omy be­cause the coun­try’s tran­si­tion to do­mes­ti­cally-driven growth will be a long-haul project that will pose some se­ri­ous chal­lenges and dif­fi­cult pol­icy choices along the way.</p>
