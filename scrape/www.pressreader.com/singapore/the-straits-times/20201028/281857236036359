    <p>PE­SHAWAR • At least seven adult stu­dents were killed and scores more wounded yes­ter­day in a bomb at­tack on a Qu­ran study class at a religious school in north-western Pak­istan, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Over 60 peo­ple were at a les­son when the ex­plo­sion tore through the madrasah in Pe­shawar, about 170km west of Is­lam­abad, se­nior po­lice of­fi­cial Waqar Azim said.</p>
    <p>“The blast took place in a sem­i­nary dur­ing a Qu­ran class. Some­one took a bag in­side the sem­i­nary,” Mr Azim said, adding that the per­son left the lec­ture hall be­fore the blast at the Jamia Zu­be­ria sem­i­nary.</p>
    <p>The death toll was con­firmed by lo­cal hos­pi­tal spokesman Mo­ham­mad Asim Khan, who said seven bod­ies and 70 wounded peo­ple were taken to the med­i­cal fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Most of those killed and in­jured were hit by ball bear­ings and some were badly burnt,” he said, adding that all of the dead were men aged be­tween 20 and 40.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers and boys as young as seven were among the wounded.</p>
    <p>“The blast took place in the sec­tion where stu­dents above the age of 18 were tak­ing a class,” teacher Safi­ul­lah Khan said.</p>
    <p>The wall in the school that sep­a­rated older stu­dents from the chil­dren col­lapsed, he added.</p>
    <p>A live stream of the les­son showed a teacher speak­ing in Pashto and Ara­bic, ex­plain­ing a say­ing f rom Prophet Muham­mad, when the ex­plo­sion took place.</p>
    <p>In a tweet, Prime Min­is­ter Im­ran Khan of­fered his con­do­lences: “I want to as­sure my na­tion we will en­sure the ter­ror­ists re­spon­si­ble for this cow­ardly bar­baric at­tack are brought to jus­tice asap.”</p>
    <p>It was not im­me­di­ately known why the school was tar­geted. No group has claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Pe­shawar was once the epi­cen­tre of mil­i­tant vi­o­lence in Pak­istan, with se­cu­rity forces and pub­lic spa­ces in the city tar­geted.</p>
