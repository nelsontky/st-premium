    <p>Months af­ter his al­leged sui­cide, there seems to be no rest­ing in peace for Bol­ly­wood ac­tor Sushant Singh Ra­jput.</p>
    <p>With the 34-year-old star’s cause of death on June 14 still a mys­tery, rat­ings-seek­ing TV chan­nels have led the way in ex­ploit­ing the case in a man­ner that has shocked many In­di­ans.</p>
    <p>“Ex­clu­sive” pic­tures of his body at his Mumbai home, where he was found dead, were on a news chan­nel. The ac­tor, who re­port­edly suf­fered from bipo­lar dis­or­der, also had his health records laid bare, turn­ing view­ers into voyeurs.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Rhea Chakrabort­y, the ac­tor’s girl­friend, has been called a “gold dig­ger” and some­how held re­spon­si­ble for abet­ting his death.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t seen cov­er­age as pu­trid as what I have on the RheaSSR case,” said ex­ec­u­tive edi­tor Man­isha Pande of Newslaun­dry, a me­dia cri­tique and cur­rent af­fairs site.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures of the ac­tress dressed scant­ily played on a loop on air, be­side poorly backed in­sin­u­a­tions that she drove the ac­tor into a self­an­ni­hi­lat­ing drug ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>“The in­tent has been to make her seem like this vampy woman who has taken con­trol over our good boy Sushant us­ing black magic,” Ms Pande told The Straits Times, calling it a “clas­sic witch-hunt”.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Chakrabort­y was ques­tioned by the author­i­ties in con­nec­tion with al­le­ga­tions of drug abuse.</p>
    <p>Bol­ly­wood, too, has come un­der at­tack with al­le­ga­tions that an ac­tive drug car­tel in the in­dus­try is con­nected to Ra­jput’s death. Chakrabort­y has been ac­cused of be­ing an ac­com­plice. This, too, how­ever, has been largely based on her leaked What­sApp chat his­tory, in­clud­ing from 2017, in which she al­legedly con­fessed to hav­ing tried Ec­stasy once and dis­cussed the best city in In­dia to get weed.</p>
    <p>Mumbai-based film critic and screen­writer Raja Sen said the vil­i­fi­ca­tion of Bol­ly­wood has been a “se­duc­tive” idea for years.</p>
    <p>“The in­dus­try is a soft tar­get and a won­der­ful dis­trac­tion for these hys­ter­i­cal 24-hour news chan­nels that have be­come a scourge to the na­tion,” he told ST. “In the SSR tragedy, they have found a di­ver­sion to keep ev­ery­one oc­cu­pied.”</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia gos­sip has been broad­cast on TV with­out any fac­tual sup­port, in­clud­ing an al­le­ga­tion that Ms Disha Salian, a tal­ent man­ager who worked briefly with Ra­jput, was raped and mur­dered. Her fa­ther has dis­missed these claims.</p>
    <p>“There has been com­plete dis­re­gard for jour­nal­is­tic ba­sics of check­ing facts be­fore air­ing them and not giv­ing space to con­spir­acy the­o­ries,” said Ms Pande.</p>
    <p>Ms Salian also re­port­edly com­mit­ted sui­cide by jump­ing off her high-rise flat a few days prior to the ac­tor’s death. The me­dia has sought to link the two in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>A suit has been filed in the Bom­bay High Court by sev­eral for­mer top Ma­ha­rash­tra po­lice of­fi­cials al­leg­ing that some TV chan­nels have been try­ing to “in­flu­ence the course of (the) in­ves­ti­ga­tion... through false pro­pa­ganda”.</p>
    <p>TV chan­nels re­main fix­ated on this story be­cause it gar­ners high rat­ings.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is also pub­lic in­ter­est from those gen­uinely moved by the death of a young star. Ra­jput was seen as some­one who achieved suc­cess in Bol­ly­wood de­spite com­ing from a non-film and mid­dle-class back­ground.</p>
    <p>Anger and cu­rios­ity have also been piqued by a per­cep­tion that he later hit a glass ceil­ing in Bol­ly­wood where, some be­lieve, nepo­tism and pro­fes­sional ri­valry de­nied him the suc­cess he de­served.</p>
    <p>Dr Am­rit Srini­vasan, a for­mer pro­fes­sor of so­ci­ol­ogy at the In­dian In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy Delhi, said the pub­lic’s quest to es­tab­lish the “why” be­hind Ra­jput’s death is “tinged with fear for one­self and anger and out­rage at be­ing cheated, even de­frauded by his death, of one’s own dreams”.</p>
    <p>“If this could hap­pen to him, how can we, the strug­glers and the dream­ers, re­main im­mune?” she told ST in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians jostling for an edge ahead of polls later this year in Bi­har state, where Ra­jput was born, have ef­fec­tively made his death an elec­tion is­sue.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Supreme Court of In­dia ap­proved the Bi­har gov­ern­ment’s rec­om­men­da­tion that a probe into the ac­tor’s death be led by the Cen­tral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, a fed­eral agency, and asked the po­lice in Mumbai to sup­port it.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Bharatiya Janata Party in Bi­har un­veiled a poster cam­paign last week seek­ing jus­tice for the ac­tor and his fam­ily.</p>

The two (pic&#xAD;tured be&#xAD;low) were a cou&#xAD;ple, and poorly backed in&#xAD;sin&#xAD;u&#xAD;a&#xAD;tions that Chakrabort&#xAD;y drove Ra&#xAD;jput into a self-an&#xAD;ni&#xAD;hi&#xAD;lat&#xAD;ing drug ad&#xAD;dic&#xAD;tion have emerged fol&#xAD;low&#xAD;ing his al&#xAD;leged sui&#xAD;cide.</p>
