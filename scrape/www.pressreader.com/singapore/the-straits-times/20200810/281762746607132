    <p>Aus­tralia’s ban on its cit­i­zens and res­i­dents trav­el­ling over­seas has come un­der heavy crit­i­cism and prompted con­cerns that peo­ple have been un­able to travel for fam­ily emer­gen­cies or to re­unite with spouses and chil­dren abroad.</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, Aus­tralians are barred from trav­el­ling abroad un­less they re­ceive a spe­cial ex­emp­tion from the fed­eral govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Per­mis­sion is granted only for spe­cific rea­sons such as ur­gent work or fam­ily pur­poses, or for med­i­cal or com­pas­sion­ate rea­sons. For­eign res­i­dents and air­line crews are also ex­empt.</p>
    <p>But some Aus­tralian cit­i­zens and res­i­dents say they have been un­fairly de­nied ex­emp­tions or have had to wait for long pe­ri­ods be­fore be­ing al­lowed to leave the coun­try.</p>
    <p>A Syd­ney res­i­dent, Ms Astrid Magenau, 42, said de­lays in ob­tain­ing an ex­emp­tion meant she was un­able to be with her dy­ing father in Ger­many. He died on July 18.</p>
    <p>Ms Magenau, a dual Aus­tralian-Ger­man cit­i­zen who has lived in Aus­tralia for 15 years, said her father’s fu­neral then had to be de­layed while she ob­tained an in­ter­na­tional death cer­tifi­cate to seek an ex­emp­tion to travel on com­pas­sion­ate grounds. She was ex­pected to fi­nally travel last Friday.</p>
    <p>“I can un­der­stand that the Aus­tralian public wants to pro­tect the gen­eral public’s health but, hon­estly, I do not see the risk I cre­ate for the Aus­tralian public if I leave the coun­try,” Ms Magenau told The Sun-Her­ald.</p>
    <p>“Aus­tralia for me is a wel­com­ing coun­try that loves im­mi­grants, it’s mul­ti­cul­tural, but since this travel ban has started... I feel very trapped here... It makes me feel like I am liv­ing in a prison.”</p>
    <p>Nu­mer­ous cases have emerged of peo­ple be­ing un­able to take up new jobs abroad or fail­ing to re­unite with part­ners. Th­ese in­clude a Dutch-Aus­tralian cou­ple who waited months be­fore re­ceiv­ing per­mis­sion to travel to their home in the Nether­lands, where they are due to marry next month, and a Ger­man-Aus­tralian father and his two sons who ap­plied five times be­fore be­ing al­lowed to re­join the man’s wife and mother of the boys.</p>
    <p>In many cases, peo­ple have turned to their lo­cal Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment, who have as­sisted to seek ex­emp­tions. An in­de­pen­dent Syd­ney-based MP, Ms Zali Steggall, said she had re­ceived queries from around the coun­try. She said she sup­ported Aus­tralia’s closed bor­der pol­icy, which had helped to limit the spread of the virus, but the sys­tem should be sim­pler and more flex­i­ble.</p>
    <p>“We can’t be­come a prison state,” she told ABC News. “Peo­ple in re­la­tion­ships, or peo­ple with ur­gent fam­ily sit­u­a­tions where there’s fam­ily mem­bers sick or a death in the fam­ily, things that are re­ally quite dis­tress­ing – an ab­so­lute closed bor­der pol­icy can be very dif­fi­cult.”</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, Aus­tralia had recorded over 21,000 cases of Covid-19 and 295 deaths, af­ter Vic­to­ria state, the epi­cen­tre of its re­newed out­break, re­ported 394 new cases and 17 more deaths. Vic­to­ria now has 14,659 cases and 210 deaths.</p>
    <p>Be­tween March 25, when the ban on over­seas travel be­gan, and June 30, more than 11,500 Aus­tralian cit­i­zens and res­i­dents were given ex­emp­tions to leave Aus­tralia and 3,300 were de­nied, ac­cord­ing to The Sun Her­ald.</p>
    <p>The Ex­ec­u­tive Trav­eller web­site said it had re­ceived more than 1,000 re­ports from peo­ple about their ex­pe­ri­ence with the travel ban.</p>
    <p>Some said they re­ceived ex­emp­tions within a day, or even within an hour, of ap­ply­ing.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers said they had missed flights or re­peat­edly de­layed their travel due to long de­lays and a fail­ure to re­ceive a re­sponse from the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>When ex­emp­tions were granted, trav­ellers were of­ten no­ti­fied within 72 hours of their de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Bor­der Force has in­sisted that it tries to process ex­emp­tions as quickly as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>A spokesman told Ex­ec­u­tive Trav­eller that it has re­ceived high vol­umes of re­quests and pri­ori­tises them by con­sid­er­ing “the in­tended date of travel and any com­pelling or com­pas­sion­ate cir­cum­stances”.</p>
    <p>An ex­pert on hu­man rights law, Dr Kate Ogg, from the Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity, said the ban on over­seas travel ap­peared to breach the coun­try’s in­ter­na­tional le­gal obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>De­spite the govern­ment’s in­sis­tence that it was nec­es­sary for public health, Dr Ogg said less re­stric­tive mea­sures could have been in­tro­duced to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19, such as test­ing trav­ellers be­fore they leave and – as al­ready oc­curs – re­quir­ing re­turn­ing trav­ellers to self-iso­late.</p>
    <p>“Pro­hibit­ing all in­ter­na­tional travel... is not the least in­tru­sive method to achieve the ob­jec­tive of pre­vent­ing or slow­ing the spread of Covid-19,” Dr Ogg wrote in an anal­y­sis pub­lished on the Univer­sity of New South Wales web­site.</p>
    <p>UN­ABLE TO BE WITH DY­ING FATHER</p>
    <p>I can un­der­stand that the Aus­tralian public wants to pro­tect the gen­eral public’s health but, hon­estly, I do not see the risk I cre­ate for the Aus­tralian ’’ public if I leave the coun­try.</p>
    <p>MS ASTRID MAGENAU, 42, a Syd­ney res­i­dent who said de­lays in ob­tain­ing an ex­emp­tion meant she was un­able to be with her dy­ing father in Ger­many. He died on July 18.</p>
