    <p>• On Dec 5, Six – the hit show about the wives of Henry VIII – staged a tri­umphant come­back when it be­came the first mu­si­cal to be staged in London’s West End since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­gan in March.</p>
    <p>Now that come­back has been brought to a sharp halt.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s health sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock an­nounced on Mon­day that the gov­ern­ment was tight­en­ing re­stric­tions in London be­cause of a “very sharp, ex­po­nen­tial rise” in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>“This ac­tion is ab­so­lutely es­sen­tial,” Mr Han­cock said, ad­dress­ing Bri­tain’s Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Many the­atres in London have been closed since March. The an­nounce­ment that London would move to Tier 3, the high­est level of re­stric­tions, was “dev­as­tat­ing for the city’s world-lead­ing the­atre in­dus­try”, Mr Ju­lian Bird, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the So­ci­ety of London The­atre, said in a news re­lease.</p>
    <p>The­atres across London “will now be forced to post­pone or can­cel planned per­for­mances, caus­ing cat­a­strophic fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties for venues, pro­duc­ers and thou­sands of in­dus­try work­ers”, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Kenny Wax, one of the pro­duc­ers of Six, said he felt “in­cred­i­ble dis­ap­point­ment for ev­ery­one who’s worked so hard” to bring shows back to the West End.</p>
    <p>But he said he hoped to get his shows back on as soon as pos­si­ble to get money flow­ing to the many free­lance artists who work on Six.</p>
