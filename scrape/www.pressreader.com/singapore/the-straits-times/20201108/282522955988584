    <p>When IT con­sul­tant Alec Wing and his wife saw the show unit for The Berth by the Cove in 2004, it was love at first sight.</p>
    <p>The Berth was the very first con­do­minium devel­op­ment on Sen­tosa and Mr Wing has been the proud owner of a Sen­tosa Cove home ever since.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally from Mau­ri­tius, he has lived here for 28 years and is a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The father of two teenage chil­dren said: “When we first took a look at the dis­play show-house, it was sur­rounded by bare land and we could see one yacht. Noth­ing was built yet.</p>
    <p>“The big trees and green­ery that lined the roads of Sen­tosa and the view made a great first im­pres­sion. I thought to my­self, ‘This is not a bad view to come home to’,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wing, who de­clined to re­veal his age, added that he and his wife were sold on the idea of “re­sort liv­ing” on Sen­tosa al­most im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Barely a week after view­ing the show-flat, they bought a first-floor apart­ment at the 99-year lease­hold condo for about $900 to $1,000 per square foot.</p>
    <p>The three-bed­room unit, which spans over 2,000 sq ft and sits on the wa­ter­front, was com­pleted in 2006. The apart­ment is one of 200 units across six floors, in a com­plex that pro­vides 25 berths for the res­i­dents’ yachts.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Mr Wing has seen the once empty land turn into a tourist at­trac­tion and fill with res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>“With more peo­ple vis­it­ing and set­tling there, it be­came sort of a lit­tle vil­lage,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he ac­knowl­edges this kind of is­land life­style is not for ev­ery­one and that the com­mu­nity is mostly made up of for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>“Most lo­cals think that Sen­tosa is too far away from things like the wet mar­ket or their in-laws’ place, so it takes a cer­tain kind (of lo­cal) to ap­pre­ci­ate it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the unit is leased out as his wife and chil­dren are liv­ing over­seas and it “makes more sense” to rent it out, said Mr Wing.</p>
    <p>Over the years, units of sim­i­lar size have fetched monthly rental in­comes of about $7,000 to $9,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Wing rents a smaller two-bed­room apart­ment on the east side of Sin­ga­pore. He said: “I don’t need a big place be­cause it’s just me. But I do miss liv­ing on Sen­tosa.”</p>
    <p>He goes to the is­land about three times a week to visit for­mer neigh­bours and is ac­tively in­volved in clubs and sport­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in the com­mu­nity there.</p>

    <p>FIRST IM­PRES­SIONS COUNT</p>
    <p>The big trees and green­ery that lined the roads of Sen­tosa and the view made a great first im­pres­sion. I thought to my­self, ‘This is not a bad view to come home to’.</p>
    <p>MR ALEC WING, an IT con­sul­tant, on what made him buy a unit at The Berth by the Cove in 2004.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Mr Alec Wing bought a first-floor unit at The Berth by the Cove for about $900 to $1,000 per square foot, barely a week after view&#xAD;ing the show-flat in 2004. He rents out his unit as his wife and chil&#xAD;dren are liv&#xAD;ing over&#xAD;seas.</p>
