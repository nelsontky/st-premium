    <p>MUM­BAI • Ama­zon.com has signed up In­dia’s big­gest movie star Amitabh Bachchan (left) for its Alexa voice as­sis­tant in a bid to lure users in the world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lated na­tion to its ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The 77-year-old Bol­ly­wood pa­tri­arch’s im­age is ubiq­ui­tous across the coun­try on ad­ver­tise­ments for ev­ery­thing from hair oil to ce­ment to a Unicef-backed po­lio vac­ci­na­tion campaign.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon ex­pects his uni­ver­sal ap­peal to help it take on ri­vals Ap­ple’s Siri and Al­pha­bet’s Google As­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>“The bari­tone that has en­chanted the In­dian film in­dus­try for over five decades” will be avail­able to the many In­dian cus­tomers who use Alexa, Ama­zon said on its In­dia blog on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Users will be able to ac­cess Mr Bachchan’s “iconic voice on Alexa by pur­chas­ing the Amitabh Bachchan voice ex­pe­ri­ence”, ac­cord­ing to the blog.</p>
    <p>In­dia, with more than half a bil­lion smart­phones and some of the cheap­est data rates in the world, is rapidly adopt­ing voice-en­abled ser­vices as more peo­ple es­chew typ­ing.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket for speech and voice recog­ni­tion is grow­ing swiftly in Asia’s third-largest econ­omy and ex­pected to jump more than 40 per cent this year to US$58.4 mil­lion (S$79 mil­lion), ac­cord­ing to a re­port by Dentsu Aegis Net­work’s In­dia unit.</p>
    <p>Bachchan emerged as Bol­ly­wood’s pre­mier su­per­star in the 1970s and is seen as In­dia’s an­swer to Hol­ly­wood’s Robert De Niro or Al Pa­cino, play­ing “an­gry young men” char­ac­ters bat­tling cor­rupt es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood ac­tor Sa­muel L. Jack­son was the first celebrity voice of Alexa. Ama­zon has since added pro­fes­sional voice ac­tors who re­cite Wil­liam Shake­speare, Mark Twain, proverbs and fables.</p>
    <p>Last year, ri­val Google As­sis­tant added the voice of Amer­i­can singer John Leg­end. The dom­i­nant Google voice as­sis­tant has yet to de­but a celebrity voice in In­dia.</p>
    <p>As with Jack­son, Ama­zon will ap­ply neu­ral speech tech­nol­ogy to make Alexa sound ex­actly like Bachchan, no mat­ter what ques­tion he is an­swer­ing, with­out him hav­ing to record ev­ery word in the stu­dio.</p>
    <p>Users can buy Bachchan’s voice to pro­vide weather up­dates, re­cite po­etry and give ad­vice.</p>
