    <p>There is no real risk of a spill from a fully loaded su­per­tanker that caught fire off the east coast of Sri Lanka, a se­nior of­fi­cial in Sri Lanka’s navy said yes­ter­day. The fire that broke out in the en­gine room of the New Di­a­mond on Thurs­day morn­ing had spread to the bridge of the ship, which is car­ry­ing about two mil­lion bar­rels of oil, though it has not reached the cargo area, the navy said.</p>
    <p>Direc­tor-Gen­eral of Op­er­a­tions Rear-Ad­mi­ral Y. N. Ja­yarathna told re­porters it was the navy’s view that there was no real dan­ger of a spill, be­cause the fire on the ship has been con­tained in the rear sec­tion of the ves­sel. “The live flames have now died down and there is only white smoke em­a­nat­ing from the ves­sel,” he told a tele­vised press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>A navy spokesman, Cap­tain Indika de Silva, said there were 23 crew on board, one of whom – a miss­ing Filipino sailor – is pre­sumed dead. The rest have been res­cued by the Sri Lankan navy, with an in­jured crew mem­ber flown to the cap­i­tal Colombo for treat­ment. Three tug boats, five Sri Lankan navy ships, as well as two craft from the Rus­sian navy and three from the In­dian navy have been as­sist­ing in an op­er­a­tion to fight the fire and tow the ship away from the coast, af­ter it be­gan drift­ing to­wards land.</p>
