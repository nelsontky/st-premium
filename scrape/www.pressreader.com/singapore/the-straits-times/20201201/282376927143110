    <p>Ever felt the urge to throw a punch? At the mir­ror, in the air, at a friend in jest, in your dreams? It’s a vis­ceral, prim­i­tive, hu­man in­stinct that beck­ons a lot of us. The leg­endary gym­nast Olga Kor­but, all of 1.52m, bounded into the ring once for an ex­hi­bi­tion fight as did the reed-thin bas­ket­ball player Manute Bol, a mere 2.31m. No, they did not fight each other.</p>
    <p>Even co­me­dian Ricky Ger­vais has let go a few jabs in the ring and it’s like ev­ery­one needs to ac­cess their in­ner Ali. The writer Ge­orge Plimp­ton once went three rounds with light-heavy­weight cham­pion Archie Moore with trum­peter Miles Davis in at­ten­dance. A bloody mu­sic fol­lowed. Plimp­ton got a bro­ken nose but a great story.</p>
    <p>So when Mike Tyson, ac­tu­ally a boxer, climbed back through the ropes this week­end, no one blinked in sur­prise even though he’s 54. What took him so long, you might cyn­i­cally think? Ath­letes, af­ter all, think re­tire­ment is a comma, never a full stop. Just like grey­ing singers keep belt­ing away, fight­ers think they have a last scrap in them. It’s not quite the same thing be­cause no one is try­ing to knock Bruce Spring­steen, 71, onto the can­vas.</p>
    <p>A one-off fight for fun and char­ity might seem gig­gle-wor­thy and, any­way, who can re­sist a cause? But there’s al­ways a lit­tle dis­quiet when has-beens start pulling on their com­pet­i­tive shorts in a con­tact sport. Boxing does to the ribs what chess doesn’t.</p>
    <p>There’s a line where sport ends and the friv­o­lous be­gins and Tyson v Roy Jones, 51, was walk­ing on it. Even in a slow news year, when we’d do any­thing to es­cape an­other Covid story, two once-bril­liant box­ers do­ing an old lurch­ing dance surely can’t be en­ter­tain­ment. Or good for their col­lec­tively 105-year-old health.</p>
    <p>At the end, Tyson, once a knock­out ma­chine, was say­ing “knock­outs mean noth­ing, you have to be able to go the dis­tance”, while Jones was do­ing com­edy. “I wear draw­ers, I don’t do draws”. This is what it’s come to? What’s next, St­effi Graf, 51, v Mon­ica Se­les, 46, ham­mer­ing fore­hands and hold­ing hands?</p>
    <p>Mike Tyson’s Leg­ends Only League will be a mem­ory lane walk for the sport­ing sen­ti­men­tal and there are a lot of them. Nos­tal­gia is a smart sell be­cause it in­volves a re­unit­ing of hero and fan and of­fers the idea of time re­wound. Maybe if we see that th­ese leg­ends are not past it, we may feel the same. Il­lu­sion is at the heart of it.</p>
    <p>But as much as I ad­mire them I’d never pay to watch Ja­hangir Khan, 56, test­ing his an­cient knees against Jan­sher, 51. Or Magic John­son, 61, and Larry Bird, 63, trad­ing bas­kets. Some things are best left as they were.</p>
    <p>Once even I got sucked into ex­hi­bi­tion fever (Pete Sam­pras v Roger Fed­erer, 2007), but now the made-for-TV, hyped pro­duc­tion has al­most no ap­peal. Sport has an abil­ity to de­base it­self in search of at­ten­tion and miked-up for­mer ath­letes, whose dis­coloured skills seem like slow-mo­tion magic, can be just sad. If I want to see Boris Becker vol­ley, I have YouTube.</p>
    <p>Age­ing ath­letes are a joy to meet but not nec­es­sar­ily to watch. Less en­cum­bered by ego, they can tell the most in­ci­sive tales and in their sto­ries their skill comes alive. Ask them about what they did with a foot­ball, just don’t give them one. Rusty hand-eye skills aren’t like an­cient bone china: They don’t re­ally gleam when dusted off.</p>
    <p>The lime­light is a sweet thing and so are pay­days and ath­letes con­stantly want to come back. Af­ter all, life is ask­ing them to for­ever put aside their one ad­dic­tive pas­sion. Tyson did noth­ing as well as arc a fist through the air and it must breed a rest­less­ness. Per­haps the ex­hi­bi­tion fills an un­ful­filled need.</p>
    <p>Most clocks ac­tu­ally do turn back in sport – all timers re­turn to zero – ex­cept for the one which counts age. Some­times, as with Tyson v Jones, we’ll see a flash of fa­mil­iar skill and say, ‘Oh, seems like old times.’ But in truth sport is al­ways about the now not the then.</p>
    <p>Once, 32 sum­mers ago, I woke up at 4am for Tyson and waited for hours through the early bouts only to watch him dis­patch Michael Spinks in 91 sec­onds with a right hand soaked in fe­roc­ity. It was elec­tric be­cause it was au­then­tic.</p>
    <p>The world has enough of scripted dra­mas and en­gi­neered emo­tion and it is why we turn to sport, for at its best it is fresh and re­jects the con­trived. For all the hype we cre­ate, its pri­mary ap­peal is still skill un­der pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion gives sport a raw mean­ing that an ex­hi­bi­tion will never find. In his prime, Tyson – who wants to fight more – made peo­ple sweat and pray. Now he’s just a mid­dle-aged man fu­ri­ously wav­ing his arms at time. Cham­pion has turned cu­rios­ity.</p>
    <p>Sport has an abil­ity to de­base it­self in search of at­ten­tion and miked-up for­mer ath­letes, whose dis­coloured skills seem like slow-mo­tion magic, can be just sad. If I want to see Boris Becker vol­ley, I have YouTube.</p>
