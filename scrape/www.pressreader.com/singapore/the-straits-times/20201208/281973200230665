    <p>As the north­ern hemi­sphere moves into win­ter, coro­n­avirus rates are ris­ing in parts of Europe and the United States. Ex­perts are warn­ing of a long win­ter ahead as Covid-19 and in­fluenza put the squeeze on hos­pi­tals and other health­care fa­cil­i­ties. In re­sponse to the threat pre­sented by the sec­ond wave, Eu­ro­pean coun­tries and many US states have in­sti­tuted pop­u­la­tion lock­downs that in­volve vary­ing re­stric­tions on move­ment, meet­ing peo­ple, work, school­ing, shop­ping, hos­pi­tal­ity and en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>We have seen from the first wave that, when in­sti­gated at scale, th­ese mea­sures can shrink the epi­demic but at a tremen­dous cost to so­ci­ety and eco­nomic life. When ap­plied for a long time such as in Mel­bourne, Aus­tralia, which locked down for nearly four months, the num­ber of cases can be re­duced to close to zero with rig­or­ous wear­ing of masks, night-time cur­fews, school clo­sures, strict travel re­stric­tions and heavy polic­ing.</p>
    <p>But is there an­other way? Ten months into the pan­demic, what have we learnt and what other mea­sures do we have in our col­lec­tive toolkit?</p>
    <p>MASS TEST­ING</p>
    <p>China, hav­ing con­trolled the first wave and with fewer than 100 re­ported cases per day, now uses a mass test­ing strat­egy when­ever a new clus­ter ap­pears. This was suc­cess­fully con­ducted in Wuhan (a city of 11 mil­lion) in May, and the cities of Qing­dao and Kash­gar in Oc­to­ber. This has been car­ried out ef­fi­ciently us­ing PCR (poly­merase chain re­ac­tion) test­ing of batches of five to 10 sam­ples at a time, then go­ing back to test in­di­vid­ual sam­ples if a batch tests pos­i­tive. The ra­tio­nale for this ap­proach is to find peo­ple who did not know they were in­fected so they can be ad­vised to iso­late and there­fore re­duce trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese author­i­ties have also acted with speed to pro­tect a pop­u­la­tion that re­mem­bers the Sars out­break and hence takes con­trol of an epi­demic se­ri­ously, show­ing high lev­els of com­pli­ance with pub­lic health mea­sures. Peo­ple are will­ing to wear masks and ac­cept other in­ter­ven­tions that are part of a com­mit­ment to the greater good at the ex­pense of in­di­vid­ual free­doms. This is ac­com­pa­nied by strict en­force­ment by the gov­ern­ment which has at times de­ployed drones us­ing loud­speak­ers to re­buke cit­i­zens who are not fol­low­ing the rules.</p>
    <p>In Europe, Slo­vakia in­sti­tuted mass test­ing of its en­tire pop­u­la­tion of four mil­lion over two week­ends dur­ing Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber. About 95 per cent of the tar­geted pop­u­la­tion has now been tested, with 38,000 pos­i­tive cases be­ing asked to go home and self-iso­late. This rep­re­sents a 1 per cent pos­i­tiv­ity rate. This is an ex­pected rate for a Eu­ro­pean coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion at present.</p>
    <p>Slo­vakia also used rapid anti­gen test­ing, which de­spite hav­ing a vari­able false neg­a­tive rate de­pend­ing on who does the tests and in what set­ting, can give re­sults within 30 min­utes, is cheaper than PCR, and can be done with­out the need for a spe­cialised lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has sup­ported the de­vel­op­ment and fa­cil­i­tated ac­cess to af­ford­able rapid tests, at less than US$5 (S$6.70) per test, par­tic­u­larly for low- and mid­dle-in­come na­tions.</p>
    <p>Rapid tests have been tri­alled in other parts of Europe, for ex­am­ple in Liver­pool in the United King­dom. In cases where there is a ded­i­cated test site and trained per­son­nel, th­ese tests re­turned pos­i­tive re­sults for 76.8 per cent of true in­fec­tions, and re­turned neg­a­tive re­sults for 99.6 per cent of peo­ple not hit by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The im­pli­ca­tions of this are that if there is a gen­eral pos­i­tiv­ity rate of 2.2 per cent in the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion, as sug­gested by the most re­cent sur­veys, for ev­ery 1,000 peo­ple tested, 17 will be iden­ti­fied cor­rectly as in­fected and ad­vised to self-iso­late, five un­in­fected peo­ple will be in­cor­rectly iden­ti­fied as in­fected and un­nec­es­sar­ily ad­vised to self-iso­late, and four who are in­fected will be in­cor­rectly iden­ti­fied as un­in­fected. Since those four peo­ple will prob­a­bly have low vi­ral loads, they may not be very in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The up­shot is that if peo­ple take up test­ing and fol­low the ad­vice (which is not guar­an­teed), this ap­proach has the po­ten­tial to re­duce trans­mis­sion and hence new in­fec­tions by at least 50 per cent in the short term.</p>
    <p>EF­FEC­TIVE CON­TRACT TRAC­ING</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has used ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing since the start of the epi­demic in the coun­try, and there are cur­rently fewer than 100 re­ported cases per day and no re­cent deaths. Any­one who is in­fected is hos­pi­talised, which helps to en­force iso­la­tion, while con­tacts are iso­lated at home with the im­me­di­ate neigh­bour­hood placed un­der a lo­cal lock­down. There has been clear com­mu­ni­ca­tion and the is­sue is seen as non-po­lit­i­cal and a mat­ter of pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>South Korea has used ret­ro­spec­tive con­tact trac­ing to in­ves­ti­gate out­breaks and un­der­stand where trans­mis­sion is oc­cur­ring. As a re­sult many bars, night­clubs, karaoke bars and places of wor­ship have been closed.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan, where there have been no re­ported deaths since May, has prob­a­bly the most ef­fec­tive test­ing and trac­ing pro­gramme. Cases are fol­lowed up twice daily by tele­phone, text mes­sages or home vis­its to re­in­force the self-iso­la­tion mes­sage, and to of­fer sup­port, which can in­clude meal de­liv­ery. Con­tact trac­ing is highly ef­fec­tive, iden­ti­fy­ing on av­er­age 20-30 con­tacts per case.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, con­tact trac­ing works only if it is done prop­erly. The WHO stresses the im­por­tance of not just iden­ti­fy­ing cases, but fol­low­ing them up and giv­ing sup­port. It es­ti­mates that on av­er­age each case needs three days of work from the test­ing and trac­ing team. Clearly, this can be fea­si­ble only if the num­ber of daily cases is brought down to man­age­able lev­els, which is not the case in many Eu­ro­pean coun­tries, nor in parts of the US.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, with case num­bers as high as they are in th­ese places, the best ap­proach for Western coun­tries get­ting through the win­ter seems to be to con­tinue to use na­tional or lo­cal lock­downs. But th­ese should be com­bined with new tools, in­clud­ing mass test­ing, to bring down the num­ber of new in­fec­tions so that ef­fec­tive case de­tec­tion and con­tact trac­ing with lo­cal fol­low-up and sup­port can con­trol con­tin­u­ing chains of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Of course, the suc­cess of all th­ese mea­sures will de­pend on un­der­stand­ing, trust and par­tic­i­pa­tion from all pop­u­la­tion groups.</p>
