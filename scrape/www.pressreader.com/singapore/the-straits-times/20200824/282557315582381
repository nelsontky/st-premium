    <p>LAUGH­TER OR TEARS?: Fans are usu­ally happy to see up­dates from their idols on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>South Korean ac­tor Lee Min-ho has cer­tainly not dis­ap­pointed his fans with his fre­quent so­cial me­dia posts, but his lat­est up­dates have left many of them puz­zled.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, the heart-throb – who last acted in the ro­man­tic fan­tasy tele­vi­sion se­ries The King: Eter­nal Monarch ear­lier this year – posted three pho­tos of him­self watch­ing the sun­set, but did not cap­tion the im­ages.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old K-drama ac­tor was seen in the first photo (above) us­ing his hand to cover his face while sit­ting on the rocks near a beach.</p>
    <p>He looked list­less in the sec­ond photo, in which his face mask was also pulled down. The third shot was of him walk­ing to­wards the sun­set.</p>
    <p>Lee’s first photo had fans won­der­ing if he was cry­ing or laugh­ing, with many sus­pect­ing that he was cry­ing.</p>
    <p>In the com­ment sec­tion of his post, they urged him to cheer up and stay strong re­gard­less of what­ever he was go­ing through.</p>
    <p>He has so far not com­mented on his pic­tures.</p>
    <p>Lee was re­cently crowned the South Korean ac­tor with the largest so­cial me­dia fol­low­ing, with a to­tal of more than 65 mil­lion fol­low­ers across var­i­ous plat­forms.</p>
    <p>He com­pleted his two years of manda­tory mil­i­tary ser­vice in April last year and was one of the most pop­u­lar ac­tors in South Korea be­fore his en­list­ment.</p>
    <p>Be­sides The King: Eter­nal Monarch, he had also starred in hit dra­mas such as Boys Over Flow­ers (2009), City Hunter (2011) and Leg­end Of The Blue Sea (2016), as well as the movie Bounty Hunters (2016).</p>
