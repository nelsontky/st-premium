    <p>GHAZNI • An Afghan girl who shot dead two Tale­ban fight­ers af­ter they gunned down her par­ents said she was ready to con­front any other in­sur­gents who might try to at­tack her.</p>
    <p>Qa­mar Gul, 15, killed the mil­i­tants when they stormed her home last week in a re­mote vil­lage in the cen­tral prov­ince of Ghor.</p>
    <p>“I no longer fear them and I’m ready to fight them again,” Gul told Agence France-Presse by tele­phone from a rel­a­tive’s home, where she was be­ing watched by guards.</p>
    <p>A photo of Gul pos­ing with a gun has cir­cu­lated on­line, with many prais­ing her ac­tions and call­ing for her safe pas­sage out of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>It was about mid­night when the Tale­ban ar­rived, Gul said, re­count­ing the events of that night. She was asleep in her room with her 12-year-old brother when she heard the sound of men push­ing at the door of their house.</p>
    <p>“My mother ran to stop them but by then they had al­ready bro­ken the door,” Gul said. “They took my father and mother out­side and shot them sev­eral times. I was ter­ri­fied.”</p>
    <p>But mo­ments later, “anger took over”.</p>
    <p>“I picked up the gun we had at home, went to the door and shot them,” said Gul, who was taught by her father how to fire an AK-47 as­sault ri­fle. Her brother stepped in when one of the in­sur­gents, who ap­peared to be the group’s leader, tried to re­turn fire.</p>
    <p>“My brother took the gun from me and hit (shot) him. The fighter ran away in­jured, only to re­turn later,” Gul said.</p>
    <p>By then, sev­eral vil­lagers and pro-gov­ern­ment mili­ti­a­men had ar­rived at the house. The Tale­ban mil­i­tants even­tu­ally fled fol­low­ing a lengthy fire­fight.</p>
    <p>The New York Times re­ported on Wed­nes­day that the killings at Gul’s home also in­volved a fam­ily feud – and that one of the at­tack­ers was Gul’s own hus­band. The pa­per, quot­ing Gul’s rel­a­tives and of­fi­cials, said he was seek­ing her “forcible re­turn” af­ter a fall­ing-out with her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials told AFP the Tale­ban</p>
