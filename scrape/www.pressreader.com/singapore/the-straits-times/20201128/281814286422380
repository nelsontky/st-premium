    <p>•</p>
    <p>LONDON/BER­LIN Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said on Thurs­day the coun­try faced a hard win­ter, but that ac­tion taken to slow the spread of Covid-19 had pre­vented the Na­tional Health Ser­vice (NHS) from be­ing over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>“We now have rea­son to hope that by spring, com­mu­nity test­ing and vac­cines will com­bine to end this era of re­stric­tions,” Mr John­son said at a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“But to get there, we must first nav­i­gate a hard win­ter, when the bur­den on our NHS and cold weather favour the virus.”</p>
    <p>In Europe, the ski sea­son is a key part of the Christ­mas hol­i­days, but with Covid-19 cases soar­ing, the idea of hit­ting the slopes is prov­ing increasing­ly con­tro­ver­sial this year.</p>
    <p>Ger­many is seek­ing an Euro­pean Union-wide ban on ski tourism over Christ­mas to halt coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sions, but many coun­tries, in­clud­ing neigh­bour­ing Aus­tria, have voiced strong op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in Italy, Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte ear­lier this week mooted the idea of co­or­di­nat­ing with France and Ger­many for a “com­mon Euro­pean pro­to­col” to halt ski tourism.</p>
    <p>He told the talk show Otto e Mezzo: “It’s not pos­si­ble to al­low hol­i­days on the snow, we can’t af­ford it.”</p>
    <p>No fur­ther de­tails have so far emerged, and Mr Conte would also have to ne­go­ti­ate with Italy’s pow­er­ful re­gional au­thor­i­ties be­fore any ban could be im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Ski re­sort op­er­a­tors are bit­terly op­posed, with some warn­ing that fol­low­ing Ger­many’s call would mean killing off their en­tire sea­son.</p>
    <p>In France, win­ter sport re­sorts are free to open over the Christ­mas va­ca­tion, Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said on Thurs­day, but ski lifts will have to re­main shut.</p>
    <p>Mr Cas­tex said moun­tain hol­i­days are still on the cards but down­hill ski­ing is ef­fec­tively ruled out.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­rally, ev­ery­body is free to travel to re­sorts to en­joy the clean air of our beau­ti­ful moun­tains and the shops which will be open, al­though bars and restau­rants won’t be,” said Mr Cas­tex.</p>
    <p>“But all ski lifts and col­lec­tive in­fra­struc­tures will be closed to the pub­lic,” he added.</p>
    <p>Cross-coun­try ski­ing, sled­ding and snow­shoe hikes are among snow ac­tiv­i­ties that do not usu­ally re­quire me­chan­i­cal lifts.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion has sug­gested that it will leave the de­ci­sion to in­di­vid­ual gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>“The first thing to know is that the de­ci­sion on whether or not to al­low ski­ing is, of course, a na­tional com­pe­tence. This is not Euro­pean com­pe­tence,” said com­mis­sion spokesman Ste­fan de Keers­maecker.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, there is no one-siz­e­fits-all ap­proach to grad­ual and sci­ence-based and ef­fec­tive lift­ing of the con­tain­ment mea­sures.”</p>
