    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has mounted a stri­dent de­fence of his wa­ver­ing re­elec­tion bid with about 100 days to go in a cam­paign that has seen him un­der­wa­ter in the polls – and bank­ing on the “silent ma­jor­ity” he vowed will bring him vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The 74-year-old Repub­li­can has strug­gled with set­backs on nu­mer­ous fronts, fac­ing ris­ing crit­i­cism over his han­dling of the Covid-19 out­break and the re­sult­ing eco­nomic pain, as well as fail­ing to land punches on his Demo­cratic op­po­nent, Mr Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est blow to his hopes to be re­turned to the White House on Nov 3, polls re­leased on Sun­day showed his sup­port cra­ter­ing in three crit­i­cal bat­tle­ground states.</p>
    <p>“The Trump Cam­paign has more EN­THU­SI­ASM, ac­cord­ing to many, than any cam­paign in the his­tory of our great Coun­try – Even more than 2016,” Mr Trump thun­dered on Twit­ter on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He added: “Bi­den has NONE! The Silent Ma­jor­ity will speak on NOVEM­BER THIRD!!! Fake Sup­pres­sion Polls & Fake News will not save the Rad­i­cal Left.”</p>
    <p>The 77-year-old Mr Bi­den, who says he is fight­ing for “the soul of Amer­ica”, im­plored vot­ers to make Mr Trump a one-term pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“In 100 days, we have the chance to set our na­tion on a new path. One where we fi­nally live up to our high­est ideals and ev­ery­one has a fair shot at suc­cess,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus killing more than 1,000 Amer­i­cans a day, the Pres­i­dent, who is at his best soak­ing up the adu­la­tion of sup­port­ers at live events, has been forced to can­cel his ral­lies and ditch the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion in Flor­ida next month.</p>
    <p>SHORT­COM­INGS</p>
    <p>The pan­demic, which has in­fected 4.2 mil­lion Amer­i­cans and killed al­most 150,000, is rav­aging the US econ­omy and – with the out­break largely un­der con­trol in Europe and Asia – has high­lighted the short­com­ings of the US re­sponse.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent has also lost sup­port over his han­dling of his­toric up­ris­ings against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity, an­ger­ing lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties with in­cen­di­ary rhetoric and a pledge to “surge” fed­eral agents into nu­mer­ous ma­jor cities.</p>
    <p>That all is not well in Team Trump’s mis­fir­ing re­elec­tion bid was per­haps most ev­i­dent in the Pres­i­dent’s re­cent de­mo­tion of bravado cam­paign man­ager Brad</p>
    <p>Parscale.</p>
    <p>With over­all ap­proval rat­ings per­ma­nently stuck in the low 40 per cent range, Mr Trump is the first pres­i­dent to seek re­elec­tion af­ter im­peach­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is of­fer­ing a vi­sion of chaos un­der his op­po­nent, in which Mr Bi­den’s de­sire to “abol­ish the Amer­i­can Way of Life” would turn US cities into crime-in­fested waste­lands. How­ever, he has largely failed to ex­pand his fer­vently loyal base with a pitch that boils down to claim­ing Mr Bi­den will have Amer­i­cans “cow­er­ing to rad­i­cal left-wing mobs”.</p>
    <p>New polling of reg­is­tered vot­ers from three swing states re­leased on Sun­day showed Mr Trump trail­ing badly.</p>
    <p>In Flor­ida, the Pres­i­dent gar­nered 46 per cent sup­port against 51 per cent for Mr Bi­den – while in Ari­zona, the chal­lenger was four points ahead, with 49 per cent.</p>
    <p>In Michi­gan, Mr Bi­den’s lead stands at 52 per cent to 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump car­ried all three states in 2016, although he won Michi­gan by fewer than 11,000 votes.</p>
    <p>‘DI­VI­SIVE­NESS AND DYS­FUNC­TION’</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Bi­den is run­ning an un­prece­dented cam­paign from his home in Delaware, with no ral­lies, few news con­fer­ences and the space to sit back and watch Mr Trump lurch ever deeper into trou­ble.</p>
    <p>But the Pres­i­dent is keen to re­mind those who dis­count him that, with grim polling in 2016, he com­fort­ably beat all com­ers for the nom­i­na­tion be­fore de­feat­ing Demo­cratic ri­val Hil­lary Clin­ton.</p>
    <p>Mary­land’s Repub­li­can Gover­nor Larry Ho­gan, who did not vote for Mr Trump in 2016 and is seen as a po­ten­tial pres­i­den­tial can­di­date in 2024, told CNN on Sun­day that he was un­likely to en­dorse the Pres­i­dent this time around.</p>
    <p>“The elec­tion is 100 days away. I think early vot­ing starts in 60 days or less. We’re get­ting very close for the Amer­i­can peo­ple to make that de­ci­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I think, quite frankly, a lot of peo­ple like me are frus­trated with the di­vi­sive­ness and dys­func­tion on both sides and don’t feel like we have two great choices.”</p>
    <p>NOT MUCH OF A CHOICE</p>
    <p>The elec­tion is 100 days away. I think early vot­ing starts in 60 days or less. We’re get­ting very close for the Amer­i­can peo­ple to make that de­ci­sion... I think, quite frankly, a lot of peo­ple like me are frus­trated with the di­vi­sive­ness and dys­func­tion on both sides and don’t feel like we have two great choices. ’’</p>
    <p>MARY­LAND’S REPUB­LI­CAN GOVER­NOR LARRY HO­GAN, who did not vote for Mr Don­ald Trump in 2016 and is seen as a po­ten­tial pres­i­den­tial can­di­date in 2024, telling CNN on Sun­day he was un­likely to en­dorse the Pres­i­dent this time around.</p>
    <p>This has been an ex­tra­or­di­nary month for geopol­i­tics. In moves rem­i­nis­cent of Cold War days, the United States and China have in­dulged in tit-for­tat clo­sures of con­sulates – af­ter China’s fa­cil­ity in Hous­ton was or­dered to shut down, Bei­jing duly re­tal­i­ated by or­der­ing the US to shut its con­sulate in Chengdu. Two US air­craft car­rier groups have been war-gam­ing in the South China Sea at a time when the Chi­nese navy is con­duct­ing its own live­fire ex­er­cises in the same waters. At var­i­ous times, the US Navy has been joined by Ja­panese, and no fewer than five Aus­tralian navy ships, even as Can­berra lodged a state­ment with the United Na­tions last week say­ing that most of China’s claims in the South China Sea had “no le­gal ba­sis”.</p>
    <p>Else­where, France ef­fec­tively in­structed its tele­coms com­pa­nies to weed out Chi­nese equip­ment from the net­works within seven years, fol­low­ing a Bri­tish de­ci­sion to do the same in less time. Chi­nese stu­dents in sev­eral coun­tries are un­der watch and some have been picked up for ques­tion­ing about their al­leged mil­i­tary con­nec­tions. Hong Kong is an­other sore point. Bri­tain sus­pended its ex­tra­di­tion treaty with the ter­ri­tory while China threat­ened to stop recog­nis­ing Bri­tish Na­tional (Over­seas) pass­ports in re­tal­i­a­tion for Lon­don ad­vanc­ing plans to open its doors to Hong Kongers hold­ing the sta­tus. Can the world af­ford these ten­sions at a time of a dev­as­tat­ing pan­demic and the worst eco­nomic crunch in mem­ory?</p>
    <p>There are two is­sues at play here. The first is un­ease world­wide about the rise of China in its cur­rent form: as­sertive, unashamed of muscle-flex­ing, and in­creas­ingly con­fi­dent about us­ing an ar­ray of re­sources from money to eth­nic sen­ti­ments to get its way in the world, in­clud­ing wide­spread in­flu­ence op­er­a­tions. The US Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion direc­tor’s state­ment that the bureau opens a China-re­lated in­ves­ti­ga­tion ev­ery 10 hours is a star­tling tes­ta­ment for not just the scale of al­leged il­le­gal Chi­nese ac­tiv­ity, but also equally, US ner­vous­ness about it. It is not clear at all how many of those cases are taken to pros­e­cu­tion or closed for want of ev­i­dence. The sec­ond is­sue is the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>The in­cum­bent, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, and his likely ri­val, Se­na­tor Joe Bi­den, are both locked in a sit­u­a­tion where vil­i­fy­ing China has be­come a de­fault strat­egy to gain the at­ten­tion of the US voter, never mind Mr Trump’s at­tempts to cast Mr Bi­den as soft on China. Those with a more sen­si­ble ap­proach within the US govern­ment or Congress, and in­dus­try cir­cles, have long been cast aside as cam­paign­ing there goes into the fi­nal 100 days. Un­der the cir­cum­stances, there is lit­tle prospect of ten­sions eas­ing un­til af­ter Nov 3. The chal­lenge for Asia is to some­how en­sure that the brit­tle peace holds be­tween the su­per­pow­ers. The re­gion should not be the grass that gets tram­pled un­der­foot as both jos­tle each other.</p>
