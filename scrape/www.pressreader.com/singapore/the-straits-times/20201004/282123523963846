    <p>LeBron James and An­thony Davis de­liv­ered a fear­some one-two punch for Los An­ge­les on Fri­day, spark­ing more mem­o­ries of Lak­ers leg­ends Shaquille O’Neal and the late Kobe Bryant.</p>
    <p>The pair com­bined for 65 points in the Lak­ers’ 124-114 vic­tory over the Mi­ami Heat, putting Los An­ge­les half­way to vic­tory in the best-of­seven Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>They are the first Lak­ers duo to score 60 points in a Fi­nals game since O’Neal and Bryant achieved the feat i n 2002 – when they claimed a third straight ti­tle.</p>
    <p>O’Neal later left – his re­la­tion­ship with his team­mate fa­mously soured – as Bryant won two more ti­tles with the Lak­ers in 2009 and 2010.</p>
    <p>James, play­ing in his 10th ti­tle se­ries and hav­ing won cham­pi­onships with Mi­ami and Cleve­land on his re­sume, re­called watch­ing the Shaq-Kobe pair­ing when he was a high school star.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously we knew the force that Shaq brought to the ta­ble, but the el­e­gance and force that Kobe played with, as well,” said James, who had 33 points.</p>
    <p>“They were very dom­i­nant in what they did on the floor, on both sides of the floor. So to be in the con­ver­sa­tion with those two guys, my­self and AD – is just very hum­bling.”</p>
    <p>Any mem­ory of Bryant has a spe­cial res­o­nance for the Lak­ers this year. The club icon died in a Jan­uary he­li­copter crash that also claimed the life of his 13-year-old daugh­ter and seven other peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers wore their Bryant-in­spired Black Mamba kit on Fri­day and re­mained un­beaten in four play­off games when wear­ing it.</p>
    <p>James said his and Davis’ roles in the team can­not be pre­cisely com­pared to those of Bryant and</p>
    <p>O’Neal. “But all four of us, we have a win­ning men­tal­ity,” he added.</p>
    <p>Davis agreed any like­ness was more to do with at­ti­tude than style of play.</p>
    <p>“They both had a com­pet­i­tive spirit with them­selves to will their teams to win,” said Davis, who is in the cham­pi­onship se­ries for the first time in his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“Me and Bron are the same way. We’re two guys who want to win no mat­ter the cir­cum­stance. We both want to make sure that we do what­ever it takes to help our team win.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the 2-0 lead, James and Davis be­lieve their team can per­form at a higher level.</p>
    <p>“We know we can be a lot bet­ter,” James said. “My­self and (Davis) were not sat­is­fied with just a win. We want to be great.</p>
    <p>“We were not happy with our per­for­mance de­fen­sively tonight. We know we’ll be bet­ter in Game 3.” Game 3 is to­day.</p>
    <p>James also had nine re­bounds and nine as­sists for the Lak­ers, who led for the ma­jor­ity of the con­test.</p>
    <p>Davis con­verted 15 of 20 shots, and grabbed 14 re­bounds. Ra­jon Rondo added 16 points and 10 as­sists while Ken­tavi­ous Cald­wellPope and Kyle Kuzma chipped in 11 points apiece.</p>
    <p>Jimmy But­ler had 25 points, 13 as­sists and eight re­bounds while Kelly Olynyk col­lected 24 points and nine re­bounds for the Heat, who played with­out cen­tre Bam Ade­bayo (shoul­der strain) and guard Go­ran Dragic (plan­tar fas­cia tear in left foot).</p>
    <p>Mi­ami failed to get closer than nine points in the fourth quar­ter, de­spite sev­eral chances to do so.</p>
    <p>But­ler vowed the Heat are not fazed by the Lak­ers de­spite a sec­ond-straight dou­ble-digit de­feat.</p>
    <p>“We’re never giv­ing up,” he said. “We’re go­ing to fight and we’re go­ing to ride with this thing till the wheels fall off.</p>
    <p>“It’s not over. We’re just down 0-2. We’ve got to do some­thing spe­cial. We’re ca­pa­ble of it.”</p>
    <p>IN THE SAME BREATH</p>
    <p>We knew the force that Shaq brought to the ta­ble, but the el­e­gance and force that Kobe played with... So to be in the con­ver­sa­tion with those two guys, my­self and AD – is just very</p>
    <p>hum­bling.</p>

    <p>TILL WE RUN OUT OF BREATH</p>
    <p>We’re never giv­ing up. We’re go­ing to fight and we’re go­ing to ride with this thing till the wheels fall off. It’s not over. We’re just down</p>
