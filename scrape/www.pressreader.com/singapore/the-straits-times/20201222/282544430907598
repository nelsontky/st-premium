    <p>1</p>
    <p>BIG SAM FAC­ING UP­HILL BAT­TLE WITH BAG­GIES</p>
    <p>West Bromwich Al­bion boss Sam Al­lardyce was not too pleased when his side con­ceded a goal just five min­utes into his reign en route to a 3-0 drub­bing by As­ton Villa, and he will have to act quickly to shore up a leaky de­fence and piti­ful at­tack.</p>
    <p>Sit­ting sec­ond from bot­tom, the Bag­gies have con­ceded 29 goals. Their 10 goals scored is the third­worst at­tack in the league.</p>
    <p>With a busy pe­riod ahead, Al­lardyce will have to im­part his safety-first style soon.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>BRIGHTON NEED MORE HOME WINS TO BE SAFE</p>
    <p>Brighton boss Gra­ham Pot­ter will be look­ing over his shoul­der with the club 16th in the league, two points above the rel­e­ga­tion zone. The Seag­ulls, who drew 1-1 against Sh­effield United on Sun­day, are win­less in their last 11 home games in a run stretch­ing back to last sea­son. Their only home league win this year came in June against Arse­nal.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>ARTETA, ANCELOTTI ONE YEAR ON</p>
    <p>Ever­ton man­ager Carlo Ancelotti and Arse­nal boss Mikel Arteta were ap­pointed this time last year and af­ter Satur­day’s 2-1 win for the Tof­fees over the strug­gling Gun­ners, there is no doubt which club made the bet­ter call. Ever­ton were linked with Arteta while Arse­nal were said to be con­sid­er­ing the Ital­ian.</p>
