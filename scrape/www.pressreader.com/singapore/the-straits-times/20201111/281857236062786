    <p>Mr Joe Bi­den won a ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­lar vote in the elec­tion with the high­est turnout in 120 years in the United States by bring­ing out the usual Demo­cratic Party base.</p>
    <p>He re­paired the so-called “blue wall” – Demo­cratic states that Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton lost in 2016. And, helped by mo­bilis­ers like Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Stacey Abrams in Ge­or­gia, he also con­vinced African Amer­i­cans to over­come ha­bit­ual cyn­i­cism and vote in large num­bers.</p>
    <p>The na­tional AP VoteCast sur­vey done be­tween Oct 28 and the evening of elec­tion day on Nov 3, as well as a Wall Street Jour­nal anal­y­sis of un­of­fi­cial re­sults, show that Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory was built on win­ning over ma­jori­ties of women, sub­ur­ban and black vot­ers.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent also had more Demo­cratic vot­ers out in cities such as Detroit and Mil­wau­kee, where turnout for the party lagged four years ago, the Wall Street Jour­nal re­ported.</p>
    <p>But within broad cat­e­gories, there were ma­jor dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, Mr Bi­den did well among women. Black women were a par­tic­u­lar force, with 93 per cent sup­port­ing the Joe Bi­den-Ka­mala Har­ris ticket. In this, an­a­lysts do not doubt that Ms Har­ris, the first black woman and first woman of In­dian de­scent to be nom­i­nated for vice-pres­i­dent, was a draw.</p>
    <p>White sub­ur­ban women sided with Mr Bi­den only nar­rowly – 52 per cent to 47 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the AP sur­vey. New York Times (NYT) exit polling has his sup­port among women in gen­eral at 57 to 42. A CNN exit poll showed white women and white men both went for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>The NYT poll also found the bet­ter-ed­u­cated went for Mr Bi­den, giv­ing him a 55 to 43 edge; the lower-ed­u­cated went for Mr Trump, 50 to 48.</p>
    <p>But, while Mr Trump’s loss was a re­jec­tion, it was not a re­pu­di­a­tion of the most con­tro­ver­sial pres­i­dent since Mr Richard Nixon.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den did not cut into Mr Trump’s base to any sig­nif­i­cant ex­tent, and nei­ther did Mr Trump cut into the Demo­cratic base.</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den had more votes than Mrs Clin­ton in 2016, Mr Trump too had more votes than when he was elected. Five mil­lion more Amer­i­cans voted for Mr Trump than in 2016 – and that num­ber in­cludes black and His­panic votes.</p>
    <p>“They saw the di­vi­sions he fu­elled, the xeno­pho­bia he em­braced… and the pan­demic he bun­gled,” Dr Trita Parsi, co-founder of the Quincy In­sti­tute for Re­spon­si­ble State­craft, wrote on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“They weighed that against the tax cuts they won, the con­ser­va­tive Supreme Court judges he ap­pointed, the cli­mate chaos they can ig­nore, and the pun­ish­ments he in­flicted on the ‘lib­eral elites’. They de­cided they wanted four more years of Trump.”</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble that spe­cial in­ter­ests ac­count for some of that. In Florida, older-gen­er­a­tion Cuban Amer­i­cans re­mained staunchly pro-Trump, in­flu­enced by fear­mon­ger­ing rhetoric about im­pend­ing so­cial­ist ruin un­der a Demo­cratic pres­i­dent. Mi­cro-tar­get­ing through Span­ish-lan­guage so­cial me­dia played a ma­jor role in that, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 76 per cent and 81 per cent of white evan­gel­i­cal and “born again” vot­ers sup­ported Mr Trump, the Na­tional Elec­tion Pool and AP VoteCast showed.</p>
    <p>“The re­li­gious land­scape in terms of vot­ing has been re­mark­ably sta­ble,” Mr Robert Jones, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Pub­lic Re­li­gion Re­search In­sti­tute, told Na­tional Pub­lic Ra­dio. “White Chris­tian vot­ers have tended to sup­port Repub­li­can can­di­dates, and Chris­tians of colour and ev­ery­one else, in­clud­ing the re­li­giously un­af­fil­i­ated, have tended to sup­port Demo­cratic can­di­dates.”</p>
    <p>NYT data showed that younger peo­ple joined blacks, His­pan­ics and Asian Amer­i­cans to vote over­whelm­ingly for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>The out­come of the elec­tion in­di­cates that the po­lit­i­cal map of the US re­mains carved up into two dis­tinct po­lit­i­cal spheres some­what like an ap­ple – the outer layer blue (Demo­cratic-lib­eral) but the core red (Repub­li­can-con­ser­va­tive).</p>
    <p>“The ‘God Gap’ is more and more the nar­ra­tive when we think about the par­ties,” East­ern Illi­nois Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­ence pro­fes­sor Ryan Burge said. “Half of white lib­er­als to­day iden­tify as re­li­giously un­af­fil­i­ated, while the right is stay­ing very Chris­tian.”</p>

A sur&#xAD;vey and an anal&#xAD;y&#xAD;sis of elec&#xAD;tion re&#xAD;sults showed that, in gen&#xAD;eral, Mr Bi&#xAD;den did well among women vot&#xAD;ers.</p>
