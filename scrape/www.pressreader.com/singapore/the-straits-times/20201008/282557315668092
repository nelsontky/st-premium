    <p>MY PEO­PLE, MY HOME­LAND</p>
    <p>Be it sci­ence fic­tion, fam­ily an­i­ma­tion, ac­tion, crime thrillers or mar­tial arts, Chi­nese movies aimed at the main­stream au­di­ence are laced with pa­tri­otic mes­sages, like minced veg­eta­bles hid­den in a kid’s serv­ing of meat­balls.</p>
    <p>By nor­mal reck­on­ing, the five-story an­thol­ogy film My Peo­ple, My Home­land ought to be burst­ing with po­lit­i­cal pride, as it is made ex­pressly for re­lease dur­ing China’s Na­tional Day (Oct 1) hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The sto­ry­telling here is ac­tu­ally stronger be­cause of that pride. The film-mak­ers seem thrilled to tell the story of how the masses rose from mis­ery to mid­dle-class in the 71 years since the na­tion’s found­ing, and that con­fi­dence is in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The first short film, the com­edy A Good Man – Bei­jing, di­rected by Ning Hao, is a stand­out. The bald and pro­lific ac­tor Ge You plays a sweet-na­tured Bei­jing res­i­dent who turns to iden­tity fraud to help an unin­sured rel­a­tive get med­i­cal at­ten­tion. A credulity-strain­ing body-switch ca­per en­sues, but there are a couple of un­ex­pect­edly sweet mo­ments, even as view­ers learn about the gov­ern­ment’s plan for uni­ver­sal sub­sidised health­care.</p>
    <p>The other short films deal with the state’s ef­forts to fight poverty, ru­ral de­pop­u­la­tion, the era­sure of eth­nic mi­nor­ity iden­tity and de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion. Most of the sto­ries are told with craft and care – even the ones with du­bi­ous mes­sages, such as Ma Liang And His Magic Brush, star­ring Shen Teng and Ma Li. This is an­other com­edy about char­ac­ters go­ing to ab­surd lengths to de­ceive oth­ers – all for a higher good, nat­u­rally.</p>
    <p>It is a weak piece be­cause it sells the no­tion that civil ser­vants de­serve thanks be­cause some­times, they are in­con­ve­nienced by a hard­ship post­ing to the boon­docks. Given how glo­ri­ous the coun­try­side looks in the movie, a song of sym­pa­thy played on the world’s tini­est vi­o­lin would be ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
    <p>The tragi­comic The Last Les­son packs a lump-in-the-throat emo­tional punch, in spite of how its plot is cu­ri­ously sim­i­lar to the 2003 Ger­man movie Good Bye, Lenin!. Lao Fan (Fan Wei) is a de­men­tia-stricken senior who be­lieves he is liv­ing in the 1980s, when as a teacher, he was posted to a re­mote ham­let to set up its first school­house. Should his delu­sions be shat­tered, doc­tors say, the shock could kill him.</p>
    <p>Not for the first time in this an­thol­ogy, char­ac­ters scram­ble to craft an elab­o­rate Potemkin re­al­ity. In this case, the ar­ti­fice mim­ics China in the 1980s – poor, but in thou­sands of ram­shackle sin­gle-room schools across the coun­try, teach­ers like Lao Fan gave the chil­dren of farm­ers a chance their par­ents never had.</p>
    <p>SAINT FRANCES</p>
    <p>Adult­ing com­edy is a new and apt way of de­scrib­ing movies about peo­ple aged be­tween 25 and 35 with fail­ure-to-launch is­sues, in­clud­ing the in­abil­ity to hold down a job or pay the rent. Throw in a neu­ro­sis or two and a habit for hom­ing in on the worst pos­si­ble sex­ual part­ner, and you have a lead­ing char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>Fans of the Bri­tish com­edy se­ries Fleabag (2016 to 2019) will be able to re­late, as will fans of film-maker Noah Baum­bach (drame­dies Green­berg, 2010, and Frances Ha, 2013).</p>
    <p>First-time fea­ture di­rec­tor Alex Thomp­son, work­ing with a screen­play from part­ner and lead ac­tress Kelly O’Sul­li­van, has made an adult­ing com­edy that steers clear of the worst talky, navel-gaz­ing in­dul­gences of the genre.</p>
    <p>In this brac­ingly frank study of what it means to be a young woman at a piv­otal stage in life, O’Sul­li­van is Brid­get, a sin­gle woman who, at 34, must reckon with the idea that she is on the verge of be­com­ing what doc­tors call a “geri­atric mother”. Not that she cares – she does not like kids nor does she have plans to have any.</p>
    <p>Des­per­ate for cash, she bluffs her way into a job as a nanny for a fam­ily with two moth­ers by fak­ing a child­care re­sume as well as a love for ba­bies and tod­dlers. Her charge, the fierce and pre­co­cious Frances (Ra­mona Edith Wil­liams in a scene-steal­ing per­for­mance) smells a rat.</p>
    <p>In scenes that are just as long as they should be – with­out a moment wasted on showy di­a­logue or act­ing – Brid­get gets to test ev­ery the­ory she holds about moth­er­hood. The forth­right Frances is there to ground her in a re­al­ity that shat­ters ev­ery il­lu­sion she ever had.</p>
    <p>THE WAR WITH GRANDPA</p>
    <p>This fam­ily com­edy has at­tracted top names like Uma Thur­man, Robert De Niro and Christo­pher Walken, but proves again that staffing a project with strong ac­tors only makes weak ma­te­rial look weaker.</p>
    <p>Based on a book of the same name by Amer­i­can chil­dren’s au­thor Robert Kim­mel Smith, the movie tries to ex­tract mirth from a kids-ver­sus-grown-ups sce­nario in the most frus­trat­ingly po­lite and half-hearted man­ner pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Ed (De Niro) is a senior who re­quires con­stant at­ten­tion, so his daughter Sally (Thur­man) moves him into her home. War is de­clared be­tween him and his grand­son Peter (Oakes Fe­g­ley) be­cause the older man has taken over the boy’s bed­room, leav­ing the child with nowhere to go but the at­tic.</p>
    <p>The movie’s lack of drive must stem from how au­di­ences have come to ex­pect a de­gree of slap­stick sadism and car­toon­ish vi­o­lence from the old-against-young setup. There is a Goldilocks zone be­tween too much fight­ing and too lit­tle and, sadly, this project has cho­sen to stay on the side of safety.</p>
    <p>KUTUK</p>
    <p>An­other film open­ing this week but not re­viewed is In­done­sian hor­ror flick Kutuk. It stars Shandy Au­lia as Maya, a nurse in a nurs­ing home who is trou­bled by ap­pari­tions hav­ing to do with an­other nurse who worked there some time ago.</p>
