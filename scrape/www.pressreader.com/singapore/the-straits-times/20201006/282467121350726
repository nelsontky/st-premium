    <p>Road trips may be out of the ques­tion given Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions, but dance film The Es­cape Game aims to of­fer an av­enue to run away – on-screen at least.</p>
    <p>In the film by Ja­panese street dance crew s**t kingz, com­mis­sioned by the Es­planade, four men, an an­cient map in hand, set off on a trail of clues in search of trea­sure.</p>
    <p>They en­ter a strange world where the let­ter C has gone miss­ing and re­alise that they can es­cape only if they re­trieve the miss­ing Cs.</p>
    <p>“It is our hope that dance can be an es­cape for peo­ple in times like this,” says group leader Shoji Mochida, who goes by the stage name Shoji, in Ja­panese through a trans­la­tor over Zoom.</p>
    <p>It is the first fea­ture-length dance film for the four-man crew, who were among the head­lin­ers at last year’s da:ns fes­ti­val street dance ex­trav­a­ganza Full Out!</p>
    <p>They are known for their wacky, whim­si­cal blend of dance and com­edy in shows such as Won­der­ful Clunker (2016) and The Li­brary (2018).</p>
    <p>The group was formed in 2007 and shot to fame af­ter twice win­ning the pop­u­lar United States street dance com­pe­ti­tion Body Rock.</p>
    <p>Its scat­o­log­i­cal name is de­rived from a Ja­panese phrase, “shikkin”, that means “to pee in your pants”.</p>
    <p>“We were very young when we came up with that name,” ex­plains Shoji, 36, chortling. “Our think­ing was that who­ever saw our per­for­mance would be so shocked that they would pee in their pants.”</p>
    <p>To ob­scure the pro­fan­ity i n Ja­panese, they de­cided to come up with an ap­prox­i­mate-sound­ing English name and ar­rived at s**t kingz.</p>
    <p>At the time, they had not yet en­vi­sioned per­form­ing abroad. “Now we travel all over the world and ev­ery­where we go, peo­ple frown at our name.”</p>
    <p>Since the on­set of the pan­demic, they have not been idle. Their first pay-per-view live stream, Nama! Ho! Show!, pre­miered in June to view­ers in more than 12 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Film­ing The Es­cape Game dur­ing a pan­demic was no walk in the park. With safe dis­tanc­ing in mind, they took to the great out­doors, but dur­ing their shoot in a for­est, it rained one day and was sunny the next, which played havoc with on-screen con­ti­nu­ity.</p>
    <p>On the road, their vin­tage Volk­swa­gen broke down and be­gan emit­ting smoke.</p>
    <p>“It was chal­leng­ing,” ad­mits Shoji.</p>
    <p>“But we re­ally hope that af­ter watch­ing, peo­ple feel that there is a bright fu­ture ahead of us, not just dark mo­ments.”</p>
