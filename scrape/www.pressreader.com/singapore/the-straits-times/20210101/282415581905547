    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON The Premier League has be­come the world’s rich­est league based on its stag­ger­ing global ap­peal, with mil­lions from around the globe tun­ing i n to watch the best tal­ent week by week. But a change of rules as a re­sult of Brexit means English clubs will not have the same free­dom to hoover up the best of Euro­pean foot­ball’s young play­ers.</p>
    <p>From to­day, a points-based sys­tem will be in place, mean­ing play­ers from the Euro­pean Union (EU) will now need to gain a Gov­ern­ing Body En­dorse­ment (GBE), sub­ject­ing them to the same cri­te­ria as other over­seas play­ers.</p>
    <p>Points will be awarded on the ba­sis of the num­ber of in­ter­na­tional ap­pear­ances made, as well as club ap­pear­ances in do­mes­tic and con­ti­nen­tal com­pe­ti­tions and the stan­dard of the club and league the player is com­ing from.</p>
    <p>Get­ting a GBE will not be a prob­lem for the vast ma­jor­ity of the Premier League’s big-money ar­rivals but the changes will have a big­ger ef­fect on the re­cruit­ment of youth play­ers and fur­ther down the foot­ball pyra­mid.</p>
    <p>Premier League chief ex­ec­u­tive Richard Mas­ters sounded con­fi­dent ear­lier this month when the English top flight, the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (FA) and the English Foot­ball League (EFL) an­nounced post-Brexit ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>“Con­tin­u­ing to be able to re­cruit the best play­ers will see the Premier League re­main com­pet­i­tive and com­pelling and the solution will com­ple­ment our player de­vel­op­ment phi­los­o­phy of the best for­eign tal­ent along­side the best home­grown play­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>The same rules will also ap­ply to man­agers and coaches based on the level they have pre­vi­ously worked at.</p>
    <p>Play­ers and coaches who do not au­to­mat­i­cally qual­ify for a work per­mit can ap­peal to a panel of ex­perts for an ex­emp­tion.</p>
    <p>As with much sur­round­ing Brexit, how­ever, the rules will be con­stantly re­viewed.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s with­drawal from the EU means Premier League clubs will no longer ben­e­fit from an ex­cep­tion to world gov­ern­ing body Fifa’s rules on the sign­ing of mi­nors.</p>
    <p>Fifa bans all over­seas trans­fers for Un­der-18s but makes an ex­cep­tion for move­ment within the Euro­pean Eco­nomic Area. That al­lowed</p>
    <p>Paul Pogba to move to Eng­land as a 16-year-old but this will now no longer be pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>One way of get­ting around the new rules is for Bri­tish-based clubs to have a link to a feeder or as­so­ciate club in Europe.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester City’s net­work of clubs un­der the City Foot­ball Group (CFG) um­brella is the most high-pro­file ex­am­ple. CFG has stakes in lower-league sides in Spain, France and Bel­gium.</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter’s own­ers King Power own Bel­gian club Leu­ven while Sh­effield United’s Saudi chief, Prince Ab­dul­lah, has an own­er­ship stake in Bel­gian side Beer­schot and is clos­ing in on French Ligue 2 side Chateau­roux.</p>
    <p>These clubs could be used to “park” young EU play­ers un­til they turn 18 and also help build up the req­ui­site num­ber of ap­pear­ances to ob­tain a GBE.</p>
    <p>The FA’s key ob­jec­tive in com­ing to an agree­ment with the Premier League and English Foot­ball League was to cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties for young Bri­tish play­ers.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of over­seas un­der-21 play­ers Premier League clubs can sign will be re­stricted to three in the upcoming Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow and there­after be capped at six per sea­son.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing about the over­all agree­ment, the FA’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Bulling­ham said: “De­spite hav­ing different start­ing per­spec­tives on how Brexit should im­pact foot­ball, this is another ex­am­ple of how the foot­ball au­thor­i­ties can work ef­fec­tively to­gether for the greater good of the game.</p>
    <p>“We will also dis­cuss im­prove­ments to the player path­way for the mu­tual ben­e­fit of foot­ball clubs and home­grown tal­ent in this coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The lim­its on sign­ing young play­ers from over­seas will have a par­tic­u­lar im­pact on EFL and Scot­tish league clubs, where a far higher de­gree of im­ports from Europe will not meet the cri­te­ria for a GBE.</p>
    <p>Celtic man­ager Neil Len­non said he thought the rules would make a clear dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“We’re prob­a­bly look­ing at the Bri­tish mar­ket more than any­thing else (for new play­ers),” he said.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s go­ing to be dif­fi­cult af­ter the end of the year to get play­ers in from the con­ti­nent.”</p>
