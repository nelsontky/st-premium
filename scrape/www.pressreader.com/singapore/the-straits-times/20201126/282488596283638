    <p>ROME • Italy’s Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte has warned Ital­ians not to ski dur­ing the Christ­mas hol­i­days to help curb a sec­ond wave of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has killed more than 50,000 peo­ple in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He also called on other Euro­pean coun­tries to agree on com­mon rules for the sec­tor to pre­vent cases be­ing im­ported from abroad if Italy keeps its slopes closed.</p>
    <p>Italy’s ski re­sorts earn an­nual rev­enues of about €11 bil­lion (S$17.6 bil­lion), a third of which comes from the days Ital­ians usu­ally spend in the Alps and Dolomites dur­ing the Christ­mas and New Year break.</p>
    <p>But Mr Conte said that au­thor­i­ties “can­not af­ford to al­low hol­i­days on the snow” this year.</p>
    <p>To try to re­open the pistes,</p>
    <p>SAFETY FIRST</p>
    <p>Italy’s ski re­sort re­gions have drafted re­stric­tions on the num­ber of pas­sen­gers that could be car­ried by ski lifts and on daily ski passes sold – but they still need gov­ern­ment ap­proval, which is not forth­com­ing.</p>
    <p>“The pro­to­col is one thing, but ev­ery­thing that re­volves around hol­i­days on snow is un­con­trol­lable,” Mr Conte told La7 TV chan­nel.</p>
    <p>How­ever, pres­i­dent of the Ital­ian lift as­so­ci­a­tion Va­le­ria Ghezzi has warned the in­dus­try may go un­der if the slopes re­main empty, telling Reuters: “Mr Conte should re­mem­ber, an econ­omy that sup­ports en­tire moun­tain com­mu­ni­ties is at risk.”</p>
    <p>Italy bor­ders the Alps along­side Aus­tria, France, Slove­nia and Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>Mr Conte said he had held talks with French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel over a “com­mon Euro­pean pro­to­col”, adding: “It is a Euro­pean prob­lem. If Italy de­cided to shut down all its ski lifts with­out any sup­port from France, Aus­tria and the other coun­tries, then Ital­ian tourists would risk go­ing abroad and tak­ing the con­ta­gion back home.”</p>
    <p>Mr Macron is in agree­ment, say­ing on French TV that the coun­try’s pop­u­lar ski re­sorts will not be al­lowed to re­open in time for the year-end hol­i­day sea­son as the risks are mak­ing it “im­pos­si­ble” for ac­tiv­i­ties to re­sume.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Markus Soder, the Pre­mier of the state of Bavaria in Germany, plans to keep its Alpine slopes shut­tered through­out the Christ­mas pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ital­ian daily La Repub­blica, Mr Conte wants a deal with cross-border coun­tries to keep ca­ble cars and ski lifts closed un­til at least Jan 10 and Mr Macron also favours a re­open­ing in Jan­uary “un­der favourable con­di­tions”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Aus­tria, where thou­sands at the ski re­sort of Ischgl were in­fected in the big­gest clus­ter dur­ing the first wave of the pan­demic, is luke­warm about clos­ing.</p>
    <p>“If the Euro­pean Union does in fact force ski­ing ar­eas to stay closed, that will mean costs of up to €2 bil­lion. If that is what the EU re­ally wants, it will also have to pay for it,” Aus­tria’s Finance Min­is­ter Ger­not Blumel said.</p>
    <p>Poland will also keep its slopes open this win­ter but only for lo­cals, its gov­ern­ment con­firmed.</p>
    <p>The pro­to­col is one thing, but ev­ery­thing that re­volves around hol­i­days on snow is un­con­trol­lable.</p>
