    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese fash­ion de­signer Kan­sai Ya­mamoto, con­sid­ered a pi­o­neer of the coun­try’s in­dus­try and known for his work with rock star David Bowie, has died of leukaemia aged 76, his daugh­ter an­nounced on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“He left this world peace­fully, sur­rounded by loved ones,” ac­tress Mi­rai Ya­mamoto an­nounced on In­sta­gram. “In my eyes, my fa­ther was not only the elec­tric and en­er­getic soul that the world knew him as, but some­one who was also thought­ful, kind-hearted, and af­fec­tion­ate.”</p>
    <p>Ya­mamoto was known for cre­at­ing bold avant-garde pieces that de­fied gen­der norms and fea­tured bril­liant colours and pat­terns.</p>
    <p>He l eapt to promi­nence with in­ter­na­tional shows from the 1970s on­wards and won pop­u­lar ac­claim for his col­lab­o­ra­tion with Bowie, pro­duc­ing a se­ries of out­fits for the singer’s Ziggy Star­dust al­ter ego.</p>
    <p>“I found David’s aes­thetic and in­ter­est i n tran­scend­ing gen­der bound­aries shock­ingly beau­ti­ful,” he told web­site The Cut in 2018.</p>
    <p>His vivid work also won fans among other legendary per­form­ers, in­clud­ing singers El­ton John and Ste­vie Won­der, and his ex­pe­ri­ence with cos­tume de­sign led him to stage per­for­mances that in­volved close in­ter­ac­tions with the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>His so-called su­per-shows were staged around the world, with the 1993 Hello!! Rus­sia edi­tion, held in Moscow’s Red Square, draw­ing 120,000 spec­ta­tors.</p>
    <p>Ya­mamoto’s de­signs of­ten in­cor­po­rated el­e­ments from Ja­panese cul­ture and he fa­mously dressed Bowie in a cape covered in Ja­panese kanji char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>His eye-catch­ing de­signs, re­plete with sat­u­rated colours and strik­ing mo­tifs, set him apart from many of Ja­pan’s more min­i­mal­ist fash­ion icons.</p>
    <p>Ya­mamoto said that his work was rooted in a dif­fer­ent but no less Ja­panese sen­si­bil­ity – the bold and un­con­ven­tional aes­thet­ics of Ja­panese me­di­ae­val war­lords.</p>
    <p>Ya­mamoto’s ex­u­ber­ant clothes and cheer­ful per­son­al­ity were be­lied by a dark­ness that stemmed from a dif­fi­cult child­hood.</p>
    <p>His par­ents di­vorced when he was seven and he was sent to a chil­dren’s home hun­dreds of kilo­me­tres away. He trav­elled with his two younger broth­ers – aged five and three – from Yoko­hama, next to Tokyo, to the far-flung south-western prov­ince of Kochi.</p>
    <p>“How much I en­vied the lights of happy fam­i­lies that I saw from the win­dow of the slow train at dusk. It was lonely and I still can’t for­get that,” he said.</p>
    <p>And while he was an in­stant suc­cess when he first pre­sented his clothes in Lon­don in 1971, he faced a harsh re­cep­tion ini­tially in Paris, some­thing he worked hard to over­come.</p>
    <p>The key, Ya­mamoto said, was to “keep up the spirit of chal­lenge”.</p>
    <p>It was a mantra he lived by through­out his life and, in 2018, he de­clared his am­bi­tion to make it to the North Pole, a dream that was dashed by his leukaemia di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>“No life is ever full of good things,” he said in 2017. “I’ve had a lot of hard times. But be­cause there are hard­ships, the joy that comes from over­com­ing them is also great.”</p>
