    <p>PHILADEL­PHIA DIS­TRICT AT­TOR­NEY LARRY KRASNER,</p>
    <p>on Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s threat to send fed­eral agents to po­lice US cities.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The may­ors of New York City and Chicago said on Tues­day they would take US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to court if he sent uniden­ti­fied US gov­ern­ment agents to po­lice their cities, push­ing back on a threat that has sparked wide­spread con­tro­versy over the use of fed­eral force.</p>
    <p>But Chicago Mayor Lori Light­foot also said she would ac­cept Fed­eral Bureau of Investigat­ion (FBI) agents and other iden­ti­fied law en­force­ment of­fi­cials, an ac­knowl­edge­ment of the scale of gun vi­o­lence and crimes plagu­ing her city.</p>
    <p>Ms Light­foot and New York City Mayor Bill de Bla­sio spoke a day after Mr Trump said he would send law en­force­ment to sev­eral cities, in­clud­ing Bal­ti­more, Chicago, New York and Philadel­phia, to crack down on protests against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity ig­nited by Mr Ge­orge Floyd’s death in Min­neapo­lis po­lice cus­tody on May 25.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent said the may­ors of the cities on his list were lib­eral Democrats, un­der­pin­ning con­cerns the threat was po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral agents were last week dis­patched to counter protests in Port­land, Ore­gon, where pro­test­ers have com­plained of agents mak­ing ar­rests without iden­ti­fy­ing them­selves and us­ing un­marked cars.</p>
    <p>Opin­ion polls show Mr Trump trails Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den in the run-up to the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. Mr Trump has sought to make a crack­down a cam­paign is­sue, tak­ing the spot­light off his re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr de Bla­sio said Mr Trump’s threat was likely blus­ter, but added that he would chal­lenge any de­ploy­ment in the courts and that the ac­tions of uniden­ti­fied of­fi­cers grab­bing Port­land cit­i­zens “ap­peared to vi­o­late ba­sic Con­sti­tu­tional rights”.</p>
    <p>“This Pres­i­dent blus­ters and bluffs and says he’s go­ing to do things and they never ma­te­ri­alise on a reg­u­lar ba­sis, so we should not over­rate his state­ments, they are so of­ten not true,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Light­foot said on Tues­day she had been told that no uniden­ti­fied of­fi­cers would be de­ployed. The Chicago Tribune had re­ported on Mon­day that the US De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity would de­ploy 150 agents to help tamp down vi­o­lence in the city.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, there’s been a lot of sabre-rat­tling about that com­ing from the Pres­i­dent and mem­bers of his team,” Ms Light­foot said. “What I un­der­stand... is that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is not go­ing to ac­tu­ally de­ploy un­named agents in the streets of Chicago.”</p>
    <p>In­stead, she said, re­in­force­ments would come from the FBI, the Drug En­force­ment Ad­min­is­tra­tion and the Bureau of Al­co­hol, To­bacco, Firearms and Ex­plo­sives, and “plug into” fed­eral agen­cies al­ready co­or­di­nat­ing with the city on crime.</p>
    <p>The Port­land protests have gone on for more than 50 nights. On Mon­day, video showed fed­eral agents firing tear gas and pro­test­ers pulling down fenc­ing around the fed­eral court­house.</p>
    <p>White House spokesman Kayleigh McE­nany said dis­patch­ing agents was jus­ti­fied by a fed­eral statute. Act­ing Home­land Se­cu­rity Sec­re­tary Chad Wolf said his agents were prop­erly iden­ti­fy­ing them­selves in Port­land.</p>
    <p>Philadel­phia Dis­trict At­tor­ney Larry Krasner said he would crim­i­nally charge any fed­eral agents who ar­rested cit­i­zens without prob­a­ble cause or re­strained them un­law­fully.</p>
    <p>But Mr Krasner said he was scep­ti­cal that Mr Trump would ac­tu­ally send agents to Philadel­phia.</p>
    <p>“Let us not take th­ese fluffy words and act like they are more than they re­ally are,” he said. “It’s re­ally just blus­ter.”</p>
