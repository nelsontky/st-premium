    <p>First-gen­er­a­tion Subaru Im­preza WRXes are rare here. The car, which made a name for it­self by win­ning sev­eral in­ter­na­tional ral­lies, was pro­duced in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Women own­ers of the ma­cho model are even rarer. One of them is 23-year-old Lim Sze Hui, who also owns a sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion WRX.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim’s love of cars started in child­hood. Her father was a used­car dealer and she would spend hours by his side as he drove a va­ri­ety of cars around.</p>
    <p>After she ob­tained her driv­ing li­cence at age 18 in 2015, it took just one week be­fore she got bored driv­ing the fam­ily car – a 2012 Toy­ota Camry.</p>
    <p>“I wanted some­thing smaller and more pow­er­ful. I re­mem­bered my dad’s 2008 Im­preza WRX and the sig­na­ture rum­ble from its Boxer en­gine,” the in­vest­ment re­search trainee at a for­eign bank re­calls.</p>
    <p>The fact that it was “fast and han­dled well” made it even more ap­peal­ing.</p>
    <p>With bless­ings from her father, who is also her co-fi­nancier, Ms Lim bought her first car a few weeks after pass­ing her driv­ing test. It was a sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion WRX, first reg­is­tered in 2007.</p>
    <p>She was thrilled with it, but deep down, the car she re­ally wanted was a GC8 WRX, which was part of the model’s first gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally like driv­ing my ‘Hawk Eye’,” she says, re­fer­ring to the shape of the car’s head­lights. “But the GC8 ap­pealed to me as it was the orig­i­nal WRX.”</p>
    <p>Also, the self-con­fessed anime fan pointed out with pride that in the cult 2005 film Ini­tial D, the father of the pro­tag­o­nist drove one.</p>
    <p>As luck would have it, one of Ms Lim’s friends chanced upon a GC8 WRX – pur­port­edly the only one re­main­ing in Sin­ga­pore – for sale in July this year.</p>
    <p>“My friend told me the car was un­mod­i­fied, well main­tained, had a mileage of around 77,000km and was reg­is­tered in my birth year – 1997,” she says. “I went to view it im­me­di­ately and bought it for around $80,000 after see­ing how pris­tine it was.”</p>
    <p>She was sur­prised by how well it han­dled. “It has been such a joy to drive. It feels al­most new de­spite be­ing 23 years old,” she says.</p>
    <p>“The chas­sis is light, the turbo spools quickly and it is re­ally fast.”</p>
    <p>She points out that the vari­ant is a Ja­panese do­mes­tic model with 280hp (ver­sus 208hp for the ex­port vari­ant of the time).</p>
    <p>“It is swifter than my other WRX,” she notes, re­fer­ring to her 250hp sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion car. “I al­ter­nate be­tween both cars daily.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim in­tends to keep the GC8 WRX in its orig­i­nal state as far as pos­si­ble. “This way, you ex­pe­ri­ence the car in the man­ner its cre­ators want you to,” she says.</p>
    <p>Still, she had to re­place the ex­haust muf­fler with an af­ter­mar­ket unit “as it was rusted at a few in­ter­nal spots”.</p>
    <p>She in­tends to re­new the car’s cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment when it ex­pires in 2027 – un­less she can find her dream WRX, a GC8 WRX Type R STi with Pro­drive rally sus­pen­sion. “Then I will take that car on a long road trip, which will in­clude some off-road ral­ly­ing.”</p>
    <p>What’s in the boot?</p>
    <p>• An orig­i­nal ex­haust muf­fler (which Ms Lim is try­ing to get fixed)</p>
    <p>• A boost con­troller from her other WRX, which she is con­tem­plat­ing in­stalling in this car</p>
