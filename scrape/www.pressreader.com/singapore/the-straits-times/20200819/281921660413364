    <p>Twice in the past few days, the em­bat­tled Pres­i­dent of Be­larus, Mr Alexan­der Lukashenko, reached out to his Rus­sian coun­ter­part Vladimir Putin to step in as elec­tion un­rest spread in the former Soviet state.</p>
    <p>In both con­ver­sa­tions, the au­to­crat from Minsk did not hear what he wanted – an un­con­di­tional pledge of sup­port from Moscow.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the Krem­lin is­sued a state­ment vaguely ex­press­ing its readi­ness to help find a so­lu­tion to the mass protests in Be­larus while con­grat­u­lat­ing Mr Lukashenko on his sixth pres­i­den­tial elec­tion vic­tory.</p>
    <p>No­tably miss­ing from the state­ment was any en­dorse­ment from Mr Putin of Mr Lukashenko, a man dubbed Europe’s last dic­ta­tor.</p>
    <p>Moscow has been hes­i­tant to get in­volved in Be­larus, an im­me­di­ate neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the land­locked coun­try for 26 years, is not par­tic­u­larly liked in Moscow.</p>
    <p>The 65-year-old leader more than once re­jected ad­vances from Russia to form a new and much closer po­lit­i­cal as­so­ci­a­tion with it. Mr Lukashenko has also been hag­gling over the price of gas that Russia sup­plies to his coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin had fre­quently ex­pressed its un­hap­pi­ness with Minsk, ar­gu­ing that Be­larus has been tak­ing ad­van­tage of tax-free gas im­ports from Russia as a mem­ber of the Eurasian Eco­nomic</p>
    <p>Union, only to export the gas, charg­ing a high pre­mium.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Be­larus, Mr Lukashenko had ac­cused Moscow of send­ing mer­ce­nar­ies to his coun­try to in­sti­gate ri­ots.</p>
    <p>Un­like the un­rest in Ukraine in 2014, which saw the coun­try split be­tween those sup­port­ing close ties with Russia and oth­ers who wanted an align­ment with the Euro­pean Union (EU), the mass protests in Be­larus have not shown any anti-Rus­sian sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>While the op­po­si­tion has de­manded the ouster of Mr Lukashenko, free and fair elec­tions and the re­lease of all po­lit­i­cal pris­on­ers, there have been no calls for Be­larus to join the EU or Nato.</p>
    <p>Key op­po­si­tion fig­ure Valery Tsep­kalo, who was barred from run­ning against Mr Lukashenko in the re­cent elec­tion, is in Russia after flee­ing Be­larus with his chil­dren. His wife later joined them.</p>
    <p>The shadow of what hap­pened in Ukraine in 2014 looms large for the Krem­lin. Moscow had in­ter­vened on be­half of Mr Vik­tor Yanukovych, the Russia-friendly pres­i­dent of Ukraine who was re­moved from of­fice amid ac­cu­sa­tions of mass killings of pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian of­fi­cials called the pro­test­ers in Maidan square in the Ukraine cap­i­tal Kiev “fas­cists” and the new pro-Western gov­ern­ment that re­placed Mr Yanukovych a “junta”.</p>
    <p>Months later, after an­nex­ing the</p>
    <p>Crimean penin­sula, Russia sent so-called vol­un­teers into eastern Ukraine, in­sti­gat­ing a war and sep­a­rat­ing the Don­bass re­gion from the rest of Ukraine.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, Rus­sian re­la­tions with the West im­me­di­ately de­te­ri­o­rated, sanc­tions were im­posed and Moscow was kicked out of the Group of Seven eco­nomic or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>It is still strug­gling to re­cover from its de­ci­sion over Ukraine.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin knows an in­ter­ven­tion in the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion and the use of brute force would risk turn­ing Be­laru­sians against Moscow, but the po­lit­i­cal im­passe can­not con­tinue ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko has been re­peat­ing the al­le­ga­tion that</p>
    <p>Western agents have a hand in the protests in his coun­try, and Russia, to a cer­tain de­gree, seems to agree.</p>
    <p>But if Russia backs Mr Lukashenko’s claims, it risks “turn­ing the de­mon­stra­tors against Russia and trig­ger­ing in­creas­ing sup­port from Euro­pean states – and, es­pe­cially, Wash­ing­ton”, wrote Rus­sian-Amer­i­can au­thor Anna Aru­tun­yan this week for The Moscow Times.</p>
    <p>“This sort of com­pe­ti­tion could po­larise the demon­stra­tions – fur­ther en­dan­ger­ing Be­laru­sian pro­test­ers.”</p>
    <p>Ms Marieluise Beck, a long-time and in­flu­en­tial deputy of the Green party in the Ger­man Par­lia­ment, de­manded at a con­fer­ence ear­lier this week that the sit­u­a­tion in</p>
    <p>Be­larus not be made into “an East-West de­bate”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, in the mean­time, seems to be play­ing for time.</p>
    <p>With pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Svet­lana Tikhanousk­aya – who de­clared her­self the winner at the close of the polls on Aug 8 – driven out of the coun­try and cur­rently in neigh­bour­ing Lithua­nia, and Ms Veronika Tsep­kalo fol­low­ing her hus­band Valery to Moscow, of the three prom­i­nent women chal­leng­ing Mr Lukashenko, only Ms Maria Kolesnikov­a re­mains in Be­larus.</p>
    <p>Against that back­drop, the Pres­i­dent might hope that the protests will slowly run out of steam.</p>
