    <p>When Honda un­veiled its first Asian car – the City – in 1996, it was an aus­tere no-frills ve­hi­cle made for the fast-mo­toris­ing pop­u­la­tion of South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>To­day, the re­gion of more than 650 mil­lion is see­ing a mid­dle-class growth surge. Ac­cord­ing to a Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group re­port, four of the big­gest economies in the re­gion had a mid­dle class of 64 mil­lion in 2017. This is fore­cast to grow to 123 mil­lion by 2030.</p>
    <p>With ris­ing af­flu­ence comes higher ex­pec­ta­tions. Hence the Honda City to­day is no longer as aus­tere as be­fore.</p>
    <p>The new Thai-made car is big­ger than its pre­de­ces­sor, but its wheel­base re­mains un­changed at 2,600mm.</p>
    <p>Its driv­e­train is slightly al­tered, with a 1.5-litre nor­mally as­pi­rated dou­ble over­head cam four-cylin­der mak­ing 121hp and 145Nm of torque, which now ar­rives at 4,300rpm in­stead of 4,600rpm pre­vi­ously. As be­fore, this is mated to a con­tin­u­ously vari­able trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Along with mod­i­fi­ca­tion to the trans­mis­sion’s shift pat­tern, per­for­mance is en­hanced. The City’s cen­tury-sprint time is 10.3 sec­onds, from 11 sec­onds pre­vi­ously. Its de­clared top speed is also higher at 199kmh, ver­sus 192kmh.</p>
    <p>But younger car buy­ers care less about driv­e­trains and per­for­mance than, say, those who grew up with</p>
    <p>lim­ited screen time. They want their cars to be more like their smart de­vices.</p>
    <p>This is where the City de­liv­ers. It has a 7-inch in­fo­tain­ment touch­screen with Ap­ple CarPlay and An­droid Auto. En­gage Re­v­erse and the screen dis­plays three se­lectable cam­era views which will help you park with ease.</p>
    <p>It has key­less en­try, start but­ton and re­mote en­gine start. The last is an un­com­mon fea­ture even for lux­ury cars, al­low­ing you to fire up the en­gine and cool the car down af­ter it has been bak­ing in the sun.</p>
    <p>For a bud­get car, it is packed with driv­ing and safety aids. It has six airbags, in­clud­ing cur­tain ones. You will also find hill-start as­sist, which holds the car in po­si­tion on a slope as your foot moves from brake to ac­cel­er­a­tor pedal.</p>
    <p>Out­side, it is sleek and stylish like a mod­ern mo­bile de­vice. Ul­tra-slim LED head­lamps with day­timerun­ning lights and wrap­around LED tail-lamps mark ei­ther ends of a sporty fast­back sil­hou­ette with a shark-fin an­tenna on top and shiny 16-inch al­loys be­low.</p>
    <p>Although ba­sic hard plas­tics still dom­i­nate the cabin, the car comes across as rather chic with its clean, er­gonomic lay­out and fuss-free con­trols. A three-spoke multi-func­tion steer­ing wheel with cruise con­trol switches makes the helm wel­com­ing and func­tional.</p>
    <p>Func­tion­al­ity abounds else­where, such as rear air-con­di­tion­ing vents, a mas­sive 519-litre boot and a roomy in­te­rior for its com­pact foot­print.</p>
    <p>On the go, the City is sur­pris­ingly ef­fort­less de­spite its mod­est en­gine. It is a light car, weigh­ing far less than 1.2 tonnes. So it has a re­spectable power-to-weight ra­tio of 107.5hp a tonne.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, it feels quicker than its 10.3-se­cond cen­tury sprint time sug­gests. There is less whine from its con­tin­u­ously vari­able trans­mis­sion than ex­pected and the car is de­cently in­su­lated against traf­fic and road noises.</p>
    <p>There is noth­ing ex­cep­tional about its ride and han­dling yet the car takes you from points A to B in rel­a­tive com­fort with an easy, breezy drive­abil­ity which some­times es­capes far more so­phis­ti­cated ma­chines.</p>
    <p>It av­er­ages 8 litres/100km, which is pretty ac­cept­able but not as im­pres­sive as its ad­ver­tised 5.6 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>As a to­tal pack­age, the car passes muster – and per­haps not just in South-east Asia. Now, if only its pric­ing was a tad more com­pet­i­tive.</p>
