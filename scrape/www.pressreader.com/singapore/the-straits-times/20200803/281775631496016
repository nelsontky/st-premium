    <p>KOTA KINABALU • Sabah’s po­lit­i­cal par­ties have be­gun closed-door meet­ings in prepa­ra­tion for a snap elec­tion fol­low­ing the abrupt dis­so­lu­tion of the state assem­bly last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Most took a break on the first day of the Hari Raya Haji cel­e­bra­tions on Fri­day but by the next day had be­gun dis­cussing po­ten­tial can­di­dates and seat shar­ing for the 73 seats up for grabs.</p>
    <p>The bat­tle­field is a crowded one, with old and new par­ties jostling to con­test.</p>
    <p>There is the in­cum­bent gov­ern­ment led by Parti Warisan Sabah (Warisan) and its part­ners United Pro­gres­sive Kinabalu Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Upko) and Pakatan Hara­pan (PH).</p>
    <p>The three Penin­su­lar Malaysi­abased PH par­ties are Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR), Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) and Parti Amanah Ne­gara (Amanah).</p>
    <p>On the other side are the op­po­si­tion par­ties, made up broadly of Umno-led Barisan Na­sional, and its al­lies Parti Ber­satu Sabah (PBS), Sabah STAR and Sabah Ber­satu.</p>
    <p>An­other emerg­ing player is for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Ani­fah Aman who re­cently took over Parti Cinta Sabah and is plan­ning to con­test all the seats.</p>
    <p>Although Warisan pres­i­dent Mohd Shafie Apdal, who was seen go­ing for a walk at the Bukit Padang park l ast Satur­day morn­ing, re­mains an in­flu­en­tial east coast Sabah Ba­jau leader, he needs to strengthen his party in the west coast and the in­te­ri­ors.</p>
    <p>His coali­tion faces stiff chal­lenges from Sabah Umno and Sabah Ber­satu as well PBS and Sabah STAR in those ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Shafie’s in­flu­ence in the east coast San­dakan par­lia­men­tary seat had boosted the DAP’s vic­tory in a by-elec­tion last year, with Ms Vi­vian Wong win­ning by a huge ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>But Warisan failed to wrest the Ki­ma­nis par­lia­men­tary seat in the west coast from Umno this year.</p>
    <p>As for the op­po­si­tion, Sabah Umno chair­man Bung Mok­tar Radin has hinted that the party wants to con­test all its tra­di­tional seats. That would leave lit­tle room for Sabah Ber­satu, who is led at the fed­eral l evel by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin. Sabah Ber­satu’s nine in­cum­bent as­sem­bly­men were elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives from Umno who had de­fected.</p>
    <p>Sabah Ber­satu, led by west coast Ba­jau leader Ha­jiji Mohd Noor, has shown in­ter­est in con­test­ing in 45 seats. Datuk Seri Ha­jiji said they were pre­pared to dis­cuss with other op­po­si­tion par­ties to strengthen their po­si­tion against the Warisan coali­tion.</p>
    <p>This is so that they and Perikatan Na­sional, Umno and BN can com­bine their strength to en­sure vic­tory in the elec­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu, which did not con­test in Sabah dur­ing the 2018 gen­eral elec­tion, spread its wings to the state in April last year. It was boosted by the de­fec­tion of nine Sabah Umno as­sem­bly­men as well as its MPs.</p>
    <p>The change of the po­lit­i­cal sce­nario at the na­tional level in March saw Ber­satu and Umno work­ing to­gether. How­ever, it has yet to be seen if Sabah Ber­satu and Sabah Umno will strike an al­liance.</p>
    <p>As for Sabah PKR, it will fi­nalise its line-up next week, promis­ing to be “ex­tra care­ful” in its choice of can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>With two of its as­sem­bly­men and one MP hav­ing de­fected, Sabah PKR chair­man Christina Liew said: “We will as­sess them care­fully. Every name we re­ceive, we will screen their back­ground thor­oughly.”</p>
    <p>The as­sess­ment would in­clude checks on a can­di­date’s ed­u­ca­tional back­ground, fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion as well as po­lit­i­cal in­cli­na­tion, among oth­ers, she told re­porters af­ter meet­ing lead­ers of Inanam PKR whose assem­bly­man Kenny Chua was among 13 rep­re­sen­ta­tives who de­fected last week.</p>
    <p>De­spite his de­nials, Mr Chua sup­ported Tan Sri Musa Aman’s bid to oust the Warisan-led coali­tion gov­ern­ment through a spate of de­fec­tions by those from Upko, DAP and Warisan. In March, PKR’s Ranau MP Jonathan Yasin de­fected to join a group of law­mak­ers led by for­mer PKR deputy pres­i­dent Azmin Ali.</p>
    <p>An­other nom­i­nated assem­bly­man, Mr Jaf­fari Wal­liam, also left. He joined the group of as­sem­bly­men who backed Mr Musa.</p>
    <p>“I ad­mit I was mis­taken in rec­om­mend­ing Jaf­fari as a nom­i­nated elected rep­re­sen­ta­tive for PKR. As for Chua, I am dis­ap­pointed in him,” Datuk Liew said.</p>
    <p>The party, she added, would not be af­fected by his cross­over.</p>
    <p>Ms Liew said they would also be dis­cussing seat ar­range­ments with DAP and Amanah.</p>
