    <p>LOS ANGELES • Ellen DeGeneres (left) on Thurs­day apol­o­gised to the staff of her tele­vi­sion talk show, say­ing she was tak­ing steps to im­prove the cul­ture on set fol­low­ing ac­cu­sa­tions of a hos­tile work­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The e-mail fol­lowed an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion by Warner Bros Tele­vi­sion, which pro­duces The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003 to present), of com­plaints rang­ing from bul­ly­ing to racism among pro­duc­tion staff.</p>
    <p>Warner Bros Tele­vi­sion said in a state­ment that al­though “not all of the al­le­ga­tions were cor­rob­o­rated, we are dis­ap­pointed that the pri­mary find­ings of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion in­di­cated some de­fi­cien­cies re­lated to the show’s day-to-day man­age­ment”.</p>
    <p>It said sev­eral staffing changes and other mea­sures were be­ing im­ple­mented, but did not give de­tails.</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions, which were made by sev­eral for­mer staff in a Buz­zFeed ar­ti­cle last month, painted a rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent view of life be­hind the cam­eras from the up­beat and pos­i­tive vibe pre­sented by DeGeneres on the show.</p>
    <p>“On day one of our show, I told ev­ery­one in our first meet­ing that The Ellen DeGeneres Show would be a place of hap­pi­ness – no one would ever raise their voice and ev­ery­one would be treated with re­spect,” DeGeneres, 62, wrote in an e-mail to staff that was made avail­able to re­porters.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, some­thing changed and I am dis­ap­pointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry,” she added.</p>
    <p>DeGeneres, one of the most prom­i­nent gay women celebri­ties in the United States, also re­ferred to crit­i­cism that has been lev­elled at her per­son­ally in re­cent me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>“I’m also learn­ing that peo­ple who work with me and for me are speak­ing on my be­half and mis­rep­re­sent­ing who I am and that has to stop,” she said.</p>
    <p>“As some­one who was judged and nearly lost ev­ery­thing for just be­ing who I am, I truly un­der­stand and have deep com­pas­sion for those be­ing looked at dif­fer­ently, or treated un­fairly, not equal, or – worse – dis­re­garded. To think that any one of you felt that way is aw­ful to me.”</p>
    <p>DeGeneres, whose show has won dozens of awards in its 17 years on the air, said she was glad that her pro­duc­tion team was “fi­nally hav­ing con­ver­sa­tions about fair­ness and jus­tice”.</p>
    <p>“We all have to be more mind­ful about the way our words and ac­tions af­fect oth­ers,” she added.</p>
