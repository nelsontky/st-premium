    <p>The on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the growth of dig­i­tal con­sump­tion in South-east Asia so much that the num­ber of on­line shop­pers may soon hit tar­gets that ex­perts had forecast would be reached only in 2025.</p>
    <p>A study by Facebook and con­sult­ing firm Bain & Com­pany re­leased on Thursday said the num­ber of South-east Asian dig­i­tal con­sumers – those who pur­chase goods or ser­vices on­line – is ex­pected to reach 310 mil­lion by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The same com­pa­nies had in a re­port last year forecast that num­ber to be reached in 2025.</p>
    <p>Ms Sand­hya De­vanathan, Facebook’s man­ag­ing direc­tor of gam­ing for Asia-Pa­cific, said: “With five years of dig­i­tal ac­cel­er­a­tion con­densed into one, the im­pact of dig­i­tal adop­tion on busi­nesses has never been more ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>“A lot of what has hap­pened has been helped by the un­for­tu­nate pan­demic, but there has been an ex­po­nen­tial growth in the re­gion nonethe­less.”</p>
    <p>The move to shop on­line has mostly been spurred by the in­creas­ing need for peo­ple to stay at home to work, study, play and carry out es­sen­tial tasks to stem the trans­mis­sion of Covid-19, the study found.</p>
    <p>The re­port, which was re­leased on Facebook, said: “So­cial dis­tanc­ing has paved the way to the home­cen­tric life­styles as well as com­merce with min­i­mal phys­i­cal con­tact. For many busi­nesses, the only way to se­cure their fu­ture is to es­tab­lish a ro­bust dig­i­tal pres­ence.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pra­neeth Yen­damuri, part­ner at Bain & Com­pany, said: “2020 has truly been a year of ac­cel­er­ated change.”</p>
    <p>Con­ducted on­line in May, the lat­est it­er­a­tion of the study in­volved a sur­vey of 16,491 re­spon­dents along with in­ter­views with over 20 com­pany ex­ec­u­tives from var­i­ous in­dus­tries across six South-east Asian na­tions – Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, In­done­sia, Thai­land and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The study found that South-east Asian con­sumers were shop­ping on­line across more cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing cloth­ing, toys, gro­ceries or house­hold ap­pli­ances, among other items.</p>
    <p>Last year, each South-east Asian con­sumer went on­line to pur­chase items from an av­er­age of 3.7 cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>This year, the num­ber of cat­e­gories grew to 5.1, an in­crease of 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>Most notably, the pan­demic spurred shop­pers to go on­line for gro­ceries more than ever be­fore.</p>
    <p>Prior to the pan­demic, this cat­e­gory had the least on­line re­tail pen­e­tra­tion, but the re­port showed that around 43 per cent of dig­i­tal con­sumers said that they bought pack­aged gro­ceries on­line this year.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of first-time on­line pur­chases made be­tween March and May this year were also found to be gro­ceries. The growth in the av­er­age amount spent per on­line trans­ac­tion in the gro­cery cat­e­gory dou­bled from last year.</p>
    <p>First-time on­line pur­chases were dom­i­nated by items such as home fur­ni­ture and con­sumer elec­tron­ics in the three-month pe­riod be­fore March.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers in the re­gion are spend­ing more money on­line over­all.</p>
    <p>By 2025, the study said, dig­i­tal con­sumers will spend, on av­er­age, 3.5 times more than they did in 2018 – out­per­form­ing the 3.2 times in­crease that was forecast last year.</p>
    <p>Per per­son, the av­er­age mon­e­tary value of goods or ser­vices pur­chased on­line was pro­jected to reach US$429 (S$588) by 2025, up from the US$124 spent in 2018.</p>
