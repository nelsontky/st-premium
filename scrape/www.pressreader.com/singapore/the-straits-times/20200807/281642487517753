    <p>A six-month ex­ten­sion in May for the com­ple­tion of res­i­den­tial, com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial projects and for de­vel­op­ers to sell off hous­ing units was “quite gen­er­ous”, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong.</p>
    <p>It had taken into ac­count the fact that the con­struc­tion sec­tor would still take some time to re­sume its ac­tiv­i­ties and pro­vided “some buf­fer” for that, he added yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who was pre­vi­ously Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter, was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on whether the Gov­ern­ment would con­sider fur­ther ex­tend­ing the six­month re­prieve that it had given to de­vel­op­ers and con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion, and con­tinue to dis­cuss with stake­hold­ers in the built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor to see what mea­sures “might be nec­es­sary to help the in­dus­try progress along and over­come this par­tic­u­larly dif­fi­cult pe­riod”, Mr Wong said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>He added that rel­e­vant agen­cies like the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity are mind­ful of the dif­fi­cul­ties faced by de­vel­op­ers and con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong noted that al­most all con­struc­tion projects should be able to re­sume by next month, as the vast ma­jor­ity of for­eign work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries are ex­pected to be cleared to re­turn to work by the end of this month.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion of the project com­ple­tion pe­riod was among a slew of tem­po­rary re­lief mea­sures for el­i­gi­ble prop­erty de­vel­op­ers and in­di­vid­u­als af­fected by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker from April 7 to June 1 ground con­struc­tion work to a stand­still, dis­rupt­ing project time­lines and the sale of res­i­den­tial hous­ing units.</p>
    <p>The six-month ex­ten­sion an­nounced in May meant a project that was orig­i­nally re­quired to be com­pleted on Feb 1 must now be com­pleted by Aug 1.</p>
    <p>An­other is­sue the Gov­ern­ment will need to ad­dress is that of help­ing con­trac­tors get used to the new nor­mal in con­struc­tion when ac­tiv­i­ties pick up, he said.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause there will be ad­di­tional safety mea­sures like reg­u­lar Covid-19 test­ing.</p>
    <p>“We are quite mind­ful that it re­ally goes be­yond just the re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­ity,” said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The en­tire sec­tor has to trans­form it­self, re­struc­ture... be more pro­duc­tive,” he added. “I think it’s a long jour­ney and the gov­ern­ment agen­cies are... com­mit­ted to work­ing closely with the pri­vate sec­tor to bring this about.”</p>
    <p>LONG JOUR­NEY</p>
