    <p>DON’T MESS WITH WED­DING PHOTOS: Think twice be­fore al­ter­ing some­one else’s wed­ding photo. This is what Chi­nese singer Xu Fei, 34, learnt af­ter she re­ceived flak for post­ing an edited pic­ture of her­self with pop­u­lar Chi­nese ac­tor Huang Xiaom­ing last Fri­day. The orig­i­nal pic­ture (above) was one that Huang and his wife, ac­tress An­ge­lababy, had taken at their wed­ding in 2015. Xu edited it such that she re­placed An­ge­lababy in the photo (right).</p>
    <p>Xu and Huang be­came closer re­cently as a re­sult of her tak­ing part in Chi­nese re­al­ity tal­ent show Sis­ters Who Make Waves, which fea­tures 30 fe­male celebri­ties who are over the age of 30. Huang, 42, hosts the show.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral celebri­ties on the pro­gramme, in­clud­ing Xu, helped Huang pro­mote his lat­est celebrity re­al­ity show Chi­nese Restau­rant, on so­cial me­dia last Fri­day. Xu, who rose to fame tak­ing part in singing con­test Su­per Girl in 2006, wrote that she edited the wed­ding photo to put her­self in it as she did not take any photos with him on Sis­ters Who Make Waves.</p>
    <p>Her post was swiftly con­demned by ne­ti­zens, who said she should not play around with some­one’s wed­ding photo, es­pe­cially as Huang and An­ge­lababy, 31, were dogged by ru­mours of di­vorce just last year. The cou­ple have a three-year-old son.</p>
    <p>Xu apol­o­gised to fans and said she had shown Huang the photo the pre­vi­ous day and they both thought it was funny. But her ex­pla­na­tion only irked more fans, who said she should say sorry to An­ge­lababy in­stead. Xu took down the photo a few hours later and re­placed it with the words: “The pic­ture is not im­por­tant. Look at the words.”</p>
    <p>Huang and An­ge­lababy have not com­mented pub­licly on the in­ci­dent.</p>
