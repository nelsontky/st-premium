    <p>Two new hous­ing con­cepts mark mile­stones for the HDB, which has trans­formed Sin­ga­pore’s land­scape for over 60 years. The Com­mu­nity Care Apart­ments in Bukit Ba­tok will be the first as­sisted-liv­ing public hous­ing here, fea­tur­ing not just flats de­signed with se­nior-friendly fit­tings, but also soft ser­vices such as a 24-hour emer­gency mon­i­tor­ing and re­sponse ser­vice, ba­sic health checks and ac­tiv­i­ties at com­mu­nal spa­ces. Over in Pung­gol, res­i­dents at Northshore Res­i­dences I and II will be the first to en­joy homes equipped with smart power sock­ets and high-tech dis­tri­bu­tion boards al­low­ing them to track en­ergy us­age and in­stall com­mer­cial smart-home so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Such of­fer­ings re­flect how the HDB has evolved to meet the chang­ing needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans. Com­mu­nity Care Apart­ments, to be built by 2024, are a timely and crit­i­cal prod­uct, given the pro­jec­tion that one in four Sin­ga­pore­ans will be 65 and older by 2030. Smart homes equipped for the In­ter­net of Things are the way of the fu­ture. Most im­por­tantly, both hous­ing schemes meet the core pur­pose of the HDB: af­ford­able hous­ing for Sin­ga­pore­ans. The HDB was formed in 1960 to ad­dress a se­vere hous­ing short­age. In its first five years, it built some 54,430 units. As of 2019, 78.6 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion live in HDB flats. From jumbo flats for big­ger fam­i­lies to granny flats for multi-gen­er­a­tional liv­ing to Build-To-Or­der apart­ments for young cou­ples, the range of public hous­ing has ex­panded with chang­ing de­mo­graph­ics and con­sumer ex­pec­ta­tions. There will be more challenges ahead, as re­cent dis­cus­sions about keep­ing HDB flats in prime lo­ca­tions af­ford­able and ex­pir­ing leases show. But Sin­ga­pore­ans have come to ex­pect that the HDB will con­sis­tently pro­vide qual­ity, af­ford­able homes at each stage of their lives. So it is heart­en­ing to see the HDB striv­ing to meet these chang­ing needs.</p>
