    <p>The con­cept of a “race-blind so­ci­ety” that is free of racial prej­u­dice and dis­crim­i­na­tion in at­ti­tudes and prac­tices is an ideal that Sin­ga­pore wants to work to­wards.</p>
    <p>But it is pre­ma­ture to con­clude that Sin­ga­pore has ar­rived at such a post-racial state, two min­is­ters – Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong and Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Ma­liki Os­man – said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) had on Tues­day called for a na­tional ex­er­cise to re­view how Sin­ga­pore’s jour­ney to­wards be­com­ing a race-blind so­ci­ety can be has­tened.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of a “race-blind so­ci­ety” is an aim set out in a re­port by the Con­sti­tu­tional Com­mis­sion to re­view the elected pres­i­dency in 2016, she noted.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim had also called for an open re­view of var­i­ous race-based poli­cies, in­clud­ing the Eth­nic In­te­gra­tion Pol­icy (EIP) and race-based self-help groups.</p>
    <p>While the self-help groups have done good work, with some ex­tend­ing help to other com­mu­ni­ties as well, their ex­is­tence re­in­forces racial con­scious­ness, she said.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ent sizes of the eth­nic groups con­tribut­ing to these or­gan­i­sa­tions may also af­fect the amount of re­sources they have.</p>
    <p>In their speeches on Day 4 of the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, the min­is­ters yes­ter­day stressed that while it is im­por­tant to work to­wards a more in­clu­sive so­ci­ety, it is also im­por­tant to main­tain an aware­ness of and re­spect for dif­fer­ences be­tween groups.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong noted that while Sin­ga­pore has now be­come less race con­scious and more tol­er­ant of dif­fer­ences, Sin­ga­pore­ans must not think that they have ar­rived at an ideal “post-racial state”, or that no more ef­fort will be needed to bridge dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
    <p>“Race and re­li­gion re­main fault lines and are emo­tive is­sues.</p>
    <p>“The risk of re­gress­ing on what we have achieved is al­ways there, and we can­not as­sume that our progress will be in a straight line,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans should also take care not to ig­nore or un­der­es­ti­mate the “se­vere and some­times un­in­tended neg­a­tive con­se­quences that can eas­ily oc­cur with un­re­strained com­ments” on race re­la­tions and re­lated is­sues, added Dr Ma­liki, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion and For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said that there is “ab­so­lutely noth­ing nat­u­ral or in­evitable” about the progress that Sin­ga­pore has achieved on is­sues of race and re­li­gion over the years, es­pe­cially with the young per­haps com­ing closer to the ideal state of unity and har­mony than their par­ents and grand­par­ents.</p>
    <p>“If it were an ex­pected or nat­u­ral pro­gres­sion, it would have oc­curred else­where in the world nat­u­rally, in­clud­ing among our neigh­bours in Asean,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We got here pre­cisely be­cause we have worked con­sis­tently and sys­tem­at­i­cally at it, through poli­cies that touch al­most ev­ery as­pect of our lives,” he added, not­ing how Sin­ga­pore­ans of dif­fer­ent races live to­gether, study to­gether and go through na­tional ser­vice to­gether as a re­sult of such poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Com­mon spa­ces like pub­lic parks, schools, li­braries, sports fa­cil­i­ties and pub­lic hous­ing, where all races in­ter­act – whether ac­ci­den­tally or de­lib­er­ately, through the EIP – pro­mote a more open and shared out­look across com­mu­ni­ties by cre­at­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for so­cial mix­ing, added Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>More­over, con­scious­ness of race in Sin­ga­pore can­not be erased, nor should it be, both min­is­ters noted.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther does pledg­ing to re­main as “one united peo­ple, re­gard­less of race” mean that Sin­ga­pore should re­nounce cul­tural affini­ties or dis­cour­age peo­ple of the same com­mu­nity from com­ing to­gether to sup­port each other and oth­ers in the com­mu­nity, said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>To be in­clu­sive, Sin­ga­pore­ans must ac­cept that there are dif­fer­ences across races and ap­proach these dif­fer­ences in a con­struc­tive man­ner, added Dr Ma­liki.</p>
    <p>“These could be dif­fer­ences in cul­tural tra­di­tions and prac­tices, em­pha­sis on pri­or­i­ties and what mat­ters more in life, but also the spe­cific com­mu­nity prob­lems or is­sues that mem­bers of a race group find that they have to grap­ple with, and re­quire ded­i­cated at­ten­tion and as­sis­tance,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, Dr Ma­liki said, should also al­low for a “pos­i­tive sense of racial iden­tity to ex­ist and de­velop”, and have in place a com­pre­hen­sive set of poli­cies and com­mu­nity ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing self­help groups.</p>
    <p>This will help ad­dress is­sues in the com­mu­nity as part of a larger ecosys­tem that pro­vides help to those who need it, and solve prob­lems ef­fec­tively and with em­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong agreed with him that eth­nic self-help groups still have a role to play.</p>
    <p>While they are race-based, they are not race-bound, and have ral­lied their re­spec­tive com­mu­ni­ties to serve the vul­ner­a­ble across the spec­trum of race and eth­nic­ity.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­teers in such groups, too, cut across racial bound­aries.</p>
    <p>Al­most a quar­ter of the vol­un­teers in Malay self-help group Men­daki are not Malay, he pointed out.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­liki added that there is no in­her­ent con­tra­dic­tion in an in­di­vid­ual hav­ing a strong racial iden­tity as well as a strong Sin­ga­porean one.</p>
    <p>He said that is why hav­ing in place the CMIO – Chi­nese, Malay, In­dian and Oth­ers – frame­work “does not make us less Sin­ga­porean, and do­ing away with it does not mean we will be­come more Sin­ga­porean”.</p>
    <p>How race is­sues are dis­cussed pub­licly will evolve over time, both min­is­ters added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s youth must have as much a voice in this dis­course on race as any­one else, added Mr Tong. Such dis­course must also take place across gen­er­a­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong added that in­clu­sive­ness is “not about ig­nor­ing or just liv­ing with dif­fer­ences, or deny­ing that dif­fer­ent groups have dif­fer­ent and even con­flict­ing agen­das”.</p>
    <p>“It is about ac­cept­ing that there is al­ways go­ing to be some give and take, and ap­pre­ci­at­ing that ev­ery­one is en­ti­tled to their po­si­tions as long as those po­si­tions do not en­croach on an­other group’s right to also have a po­si­tion, al­beit a dif­fer­ent one, and per­haps even one that you might dis­agree with,” he said.</p>
    <p>We all want the ideals of a ‘race-blind so­ci­ety’, one where there is no racial prej­u­dice and dis­crim­i­na­tion in our at­ti­tudes and prac­tices, in­clud­ing in the way we treat one an­other, and select peo­ple for jobs. But we must not con­fuse this with be­ing blind to the gen­uine dif­fer­ences and con­texts across races, nei­ther should we ig­nore or un­der­es­ti­mate the se­vere and some­times un­in­tended neg­a­tive con­se­quences that can eas­ily oc­cur with un­re­strained com­ments on race re­la­tions and re­lated is­sues.</p>
    <p>DR MA­LIKI OS­MAN, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>In­clu­sive­ness is not about ig­nor­ing or just liv­ing with dif­fer­ences, or deny­ing that dif­fer­ent groups have dif­fer­ent or even con­flict­ing agen­das. It is about ac­cept­ing that there is al­ways go­ing to be some give and take, and ap­pre­ci­at­ing that ev­ery­one is en­ti­tled to their po­si­tions as long as those po­si­tions do not en­croach on an­other group’s right to also have a po­si­tion, al­beit a dif­fer­ent one, and per­haps even one that you might dis­agree with.</p>
