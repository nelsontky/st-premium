    <p>A new travel bub­ble that al­lows New Zealan­ders to en­ter parts of Aus­tralia with­out quar­an­tin­ing has run into prob­lems af­ter ar­rivals quickly trav­elled to re­gions out­side the bub­ble. The move an­gered lead­ers of states that are not part of the bub­ble, who said they had not agreed to al­low peo­ple from New Zealand to en­ter.</p>
    <p>A new travel bub­ble that al­lows New Zealan­ders to en­ter parts of Aus­tralia with­out quar­an­tin­ing has run into prob­lems af­ter ar­rivals quickly trav­elled to re­gions out­side the bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s first travel bub­ble came into ef­fect on Oct 16 af­ter New South Wales, the coun­try’s most pop­u­lous state, and North­ern Ter­ri­tory de­cided to al­low peo­ple to visit from New Zealand with­out hav­ing to un­dergo the usual 14-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>But the ar­range­ment proved con­tro­ver­sial af­ter peo­ple be­gan fly­ing in from New Zealand and then trav­elled on to other states.</p>
    <p>The move an­gered lead­ers of the other states, who said they had not agreed to al­low peo­ple from New Zealand to en­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Andrews, premier of Vic­to­ria state, wrote to Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son to ex­press his cha­grin af­ter 17 peo­ple from New Zealand landed in Syd­ney in New South Wales and promptly flew on to Mel­bourne in Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria is emerg­ing from one of the world’s long­est lock­downs as it tries to de­feat a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>“We’re dis­ap­pointed this has hap­pened,” Mr Andrews said. “It is ex­actly the op­po­site of what we signed up for.”</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment hit back, say­ing Vic­to­ria was aware of the travel ar­range­ments and could have im­posed mea­sures to bar ac­cess to peo­ple from New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Other states also ex­pressed anger and moved to quar­an­tine trav­ellers who en­tered from New Zealand.</p>
    <p>The state of South Aus­tralia ini­tially put some 12 ar­rivals from New Zealand on 14-day quar­an­tine, but re­leased them this week af­ter as­sess­ing that they posed no risk. The state has now be­come the third ter­ri­tory in Aus­tralia to join the travel bub­ble.</p>
    <p>New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern has not agreed to waive quar­an­tine re­quire­ments for those ar­riv­ing from Aus­tralia, mean­ing that the travel bub­ble is oneway only.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian state and fed­eral lead­ers have urged Ms Ardern to let New Zealand join the travel bub­ble, though she has so far re­sisted. New Zealand is mostly free of com­mu­nity-trans­mit­ted Covid-19 cases af­ter im­pos­ing strin­gent mea­sures, in­clud­ing a strict lock­down.</p>
    <p>Mr Steven Mar­shall, premier of South Aus­tralia, said he has writ­ten to Ms Ardern to re­quest re­cip­ro­cal ar­range­ments, not­ing that his state – un­like New South Wales – has no Covid-19 com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>He said Air New Zealand had in­di­cated that it could re­sume flights between New Zealand’s Auck­land city and Ade­laide, cap­i­tal of South Aus­tralia, within weeks if quar­an­tine ar­range­ments were lifted.</p>
    <p>“There are still ex­am­ples of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in New South Wales; there aren’t in South Aus­tralia, so I’ve laid out the case for South Aus­tralia hav­ing dif­fer­ent ar­range­ments to other parts of the coun­try,” said Mr Mar­shall.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said last Fri­day that he be­lieved the travel bub­ble with New Zealand was now work­ing well, not­ing that he had just met state and ter­ri­tory lead­ers and none of them had raised any con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“I’m pleased with how that is pro­ceed­ing,” he told re­porters. “There were no is­sues raised about that to­day, so that’s good.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said this month that Aus­tralia would con­sider open­ing travel bub­bles with Sin­ga­pore, South Korea, Ja­pan and Pa­cific is­land na­tions. He and Aus­tralia’s For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne had dis­cussed safe travel ar­range­ments with the lead­ers of coun­tries across the re­gion, he said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Sin­ga­pore be­gan al­low­ing trav­ellers from Aus­tralia – aside from those from Vic­to­ria – to en­ter with­out un­der­go­ing the usual quar­an­tine re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas, Aus­tralia’s na­tional car­rier, said last Fri­day that it was pri­ori­tis­ing re­sump­tion of flights to Asia amid hopes that travel bub­bles could soon be es­tab­lished.</p>
    <p>But it added that it did not ex­pect nor­mal travel to the United States or the United King­dom to re­sume un­til a vac­cine was in place be­cause of the se­ri­ous out­breaks in those coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The air­line’s chair­man Richard Goy­der said at the com­pany’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ing: “By early next year, we may find that (South) Korea, Tai­wan and var­i­ous is­lands in the Pa­cific are top Qan­tas des­ti­na­tions while we wait for our core internatio­nal mar­kets like the US and UK to re­open.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said last Fri­day that he could not give a set timetable for fu­ture travel bub­bles. “The quar­an­tine is­sues... that’s the first thing you’ve got to re­solve.”</p>
    <p>But he added: “We’re al­ready mov­ing for­ward to try to solve these prob­lems, so we can be proac­tive about this.”</p>
    <p>PRI­ORI­TIS­ING ASIA By early next year, we may find that (South) Korea, Tai­wan and var­i­ous is­lands in the Pa­cific are top Qan­tas des­ti­na­tions while we wait for our core internatio­nal mar­kets like the US and UK to re­open. QAN­TAS CHAIR­MAN RICHARD GOY­DER</p>
