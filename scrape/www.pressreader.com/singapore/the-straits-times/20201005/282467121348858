    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese singer Ayumi Ha­masaki (left) sur­prised fans ear­lier this year when she an­nounced that she had given birth to a son in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The queen of Jpop called her son “an an­gel” but did not dis­close who the father is.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral me­dia out­lets spec­u­lated that he is 22-yearold dancer Shun­pei Araki.</p>
    <p>Ha­masaki dropped a fur­ther bomb­shell on her 42nd birth­day last Fri­day af­ter her on­line con­cert when she dis­closed that she is preg­nant with her sec­ond child.</p>
    <p>She wrote on her of­fi­cial fan site that she had a “sec­ond an­gel” in her tummy and that she would do her best to raise the baby. The Ja­panese me­dia spec­u­lated that she is four to five months preg­nant.</p>
    <p>Ha­masaki was pre­vi­ously mar­ried to Aus­trian ac­tor and model Manuel Schwarz be­tween 2011 and 2012, and Amer­i­can med­i­cal stu­dent Tyson Bod­kin from 2013 to 2016.</p>
    <p>She was ro­man­ti­cally linked to Araki in 2018, but she has never con­firmed the re­la­tion­ship. Araki wished Ha­masaki a happy birth­day on so­cial me­dia last Fri­day, ad­dress­ing her as “Queen”.</p>
    <p>Ha­masaki broke onto the scene in 1998 with her de­but sin­gle Poker Face.</p>
    <p>She was orig­i­nally plan­ning to hold a con­cert tour from Fe­bru­ary to Au­gust this year to mark her 22nd year in show business. How­ever, it was can­celled af­ter her first show due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ha­masaki, who re­vealed in 2017 that she was grap­pling with hear­ing loss, re­leased two sin­gles in July.</p>
