    <p>Manda­tory home-based learn­ing (HBL) drove mother of five Murni Ab­dul Hamid up the wall, but it also pushed her to branch out into pub­lish­ing.</p>
    <p>Like many other busi­ness own­ers, the direc­tor of a chain of child­care cen­tres and kinder­gartens, as well as sev­eral en­rich­ment cen­tres, was wor­ried about the im­pact of the pan­demic on her bot­tom line.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, we had to stop some of our oper­a­tions. That’s when I had the idea of cre­at­ing a book,” she says.</p>
    <p>In-per­son en­rich­ment classes at her out­fit, LMR Ed­u­ca­tion, ceased for three months, although the ses­sions even­tu­ally shifted on­line.</p>
    <p>She suf­fered a drop in in­come from the phys­i­cal en­rich­ment classes for Ara­bic, Malay and English phon­ics she of­fers, although de­mand for ed­u­ca­tional ma­te­ri­als sold on­line by LMR Ed­u­ca­tion rose.</p>
    <p>With two co-au­thors, she wrote Daily Du’a & Dhikr For Kids, an Is­lamic prayer book. They started plan­ning the book in June last year and it was pub­lished last month by LMR Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Priced at $12.90, it is avail­able at lit­tle­mus­lim­read­ers.com.</p>
    <p>She fig­ured that work­ing from home en masse meant par­ents were prob­a­bly in a bet­ter po­si­tion to ob­serve and guide their chil­dren daily in moral in­struc­tion, which her book en­cour­ages.</p>
    <p>She also saw a gap in the lo­cal mar­ket for such pub­li­ca­tions, which she plans to plug in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Daily Du’a & Dhikr For Kids fea­tures Ara­bic text, translit­er­a­tion to help read­ers pro­nounce the Ara­bic words, and trans­la­tion into English. Sim­i­lar books from Malaysian pub­lish­ers of­ten have trans­la­tions in Malay, in­stead of English.</p>
    <p>Murni and her civil ser­vant hus­band, both 37, have five chil­dren aged be­tween two and 12.</p>
    <p>She says: “It was some­thing we could do to ex­pand the busi­ness, which we had done in pre­vi­ous years by open­ing new cen­tres. It’s im­por­tant to di­ver­sify how we do busi­ness dur­ing the pan­demic.”</p>
