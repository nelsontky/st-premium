    <p>There is no change in the way an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir is be­ing used to treat Covid-19 pa­tients here, as it is rel­a­tively safe and has po­ten­tial ben­e­fit for some peo­ple, the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) said.</p>
    <p>It was re­spond­ing to a Nov 20 World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) rec­om­men­da­tion that the drug should not be used to treat Covid-19 pa­tients, no mat­ter how se­vere their ill­ness, as it has “no im­por­tant ef­fect” on sur­vival chances.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment to The Straits Times on Tues­day, NCID said: “Remde­sivir is avail­able in Sin­ga­pore, and given its rel­a­tively safe pro­file and po­ten­tial ben­e­fit in some pa­tients, clin­i­cians can ex­er­cise dis­cre­tion of its use in treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“There is no sig­nif­i­cant change at the cur­rent stage in our ap­proach to ther­a­peu­tic treat­ment for pa­tients with Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir, de­vel­oped by United States drug­maker Gilead Sci­ences, re­ceived con­di­tional ap­proval by Sin­ga­pore’s Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity in June to be used out­side of clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ists can ad­min­is­ter it to Covid-19 pa­tients with low oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion lev­els, less than or equal to 94 per cent, or those who might re­quire sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen or more in­ten­sive breath­ing sup­port.</p>
    <p>WHO, how­ever, rec­om­mended against the use of remde­sivir, given the weak ev­i­dence that it im­proves sur­vival and other out­comes in pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The rec­om­men­da­tion was de­vel­oped by an in­ter­na­tional guide­line devel­op­ment panel com­pris­ing 28 in­di­vid­u­als – 24 con­tent ex­perts such as clin­i­cians, method­ol­o­gists and sci­en­tists, and four Covid-19 sur­vivors. NCID’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, is one of the panel mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The NCID state­ment said: “Al­though the anal­y­sis did not re­veal ev­i­dence to sup­port the use of remde­sivir in pa­tients with Covid-19, re­gard­less of dis­ease sever­ity, the ev­i­dence against its use was noted to be weak.”</p>
    <p>Sub-group anal­y­sis – where study sam­ples are bro­ken down into smaller sub­sets – from the US Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health’s adap­tive Covid-19 treat­ment trial and WHO’s Sol­i­dar­ity study in­volv­ing pa­tients re­quir­ing low amounts of oxy­gen, sug­gested that remde­sivir pro­vided some ben­e­fit, noted NCID.</p>
    <p>But it was judged that the sub­group anal­y­sis it­self was in­suf­fi­cient to make rec­om­men­da­tions, it added.</p>
    <p>“The re­port (WHO’s rec­om­men­da­tion) also recog­nised the lack of ev­i­dence re­gard­ing the in­creased risk of se­ri­ous ad­verse events in pa­tients re­ceiv­ing remde­sivir.</p>
    <p>“The role of remde­sivir in fu­ture clin­i­cal tri­als and re­search is not negated by this re­port.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 therapeuti­cs is a rapidly mov­ing field and the NCID Covid-19 ther­a­peu­tic work group will con­tinue to mon­i­tor and de­lib­er­ate on the re­cent data and WHO rec­om­men­da­tion... Sin­ga­pore’s cur­rent ap­proaches on early case de­tec­tion, close mon­i­tor­ing of dis­ease pro­gres­sion to al­low early in­ter­ven­tion at the ap­pro­pri­ate time point must be con­tin­u­ously em­pha­sised.”</p>
