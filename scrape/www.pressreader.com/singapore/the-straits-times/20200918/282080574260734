    <p>In his Fo­rum let­ter, Mr Tang Li said a com­mu­nity has var­i­ous ways to nur­ture en­trepreneur­ship (En­trepreneur­s can­not be made to or­der, Sept 4).</p>
    <p>It is in the best in­ter­est of the com­mu­nity to sup­port en­trepreneur­s, par­tic­u­larly in the cur­rent eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Why should any­one con­sider start­ing up in a tough eco­nomic cli­mate? Why should the com­mu­nity, par­tic­u­larly ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions, en­cour­age peo­ple to take a ca­reer path that is prone to fail­ure?</p>
    <p>The an­swer can be found in a sin­gle word – re­silience. En­trepreneur­ship, in­clud­ing failed en­trepreneur­ship, helps de­velop re­silience, which will help peo­ple weather the storms ahead.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has been hard on the global econ­omy, and it will not be the only cri­sis that tomorrow’s job seek­ers will face. As a com­mu­nity, we have an obli­ga­tion to en­sure that our mem­bers have the re­silience to sur­vive any fu­ture eco­nomic cri­sis. We need peo­ple who can earn a liv­ing and cre­ate more jobs in an en­vi­ron­ment where jobs are scarce.</p>
    <p>How do you do it? I call this the “rein­ven­tion of fail­ure”.</p>
    <p>Mr Tang rightly pointed to the fact that in en­trepreneur­ship, the chances of fail­ure out­weigh the chances of suc­cess – it is il­log­i­cal to choose a path that would likely re­sult in fail­ure. On the other hand, in a job-scarce econ­omy, one might have to take up en­trepreneur­ship as a means of survival.</p>
    <p>Real life is about deal­ing with fail­ure as much as it is about en­joy­ing suc­cess. No one wants fail­ure, but a failed en­tre­pre­neur has only one op­tion: To learn from the fail­ure and start again un­til suc­cess is achieved.</p>
    <p>If the failed en­tre­pre­neur wishes to re­turn to em­ploy­ment, he would have de­vel­oped a va­ri­ety of skills which would make him more em­ploy­able. The ex­pe­ri­ence of start­ing and run­ning a busi­ness will pro­vide peo­ple with an un­der­stand­ing of man­age­ment and the abil­ity to have an over­view of larger, wider busi­ness per­spec­tives. Most im­por­tantly, it pro­vides the abil­ity to un­der­stand cus­tomers’ prob­lems.</p>
    <p>As a com­mu­nity, we need to help peo­ple un­der­stand that fail­ure is a fan­tas­tic teacher. No one likes fail­ure, but if we do fail, we will learn, and that can only be good for our so­ci­ety. Alex Lin (Dr)</p>
