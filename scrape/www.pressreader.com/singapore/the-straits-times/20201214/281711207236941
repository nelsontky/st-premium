    <p>SYD­NEY • Just days af­ter bush fires threat­ened a World Her­itage site in Aus­tralia, thou­sands of peo­ple braced them­selves for floods on the sub­trop­i­cal east coast, with beaches closed and res­i­dents be­ing urged to sand­bag their homes.</p>
    <p>With as much as 475mm of rain in the pre­vi­ous 24 hours, the Aus­tralian Bureau of Me­te­o­rol­ogy yes­ter­day is­sued a “se­vere weather warn­ing” for the bor­der area be­tween New South Wales and</p>
    <p>Queens­land states, a heav­ily pop­u­lated area that in­cludes the Queens­land state cap­i­tal Bris­bane.</p>
    <p>A week ear­lier, nearby Fraser Is­land was evac­u­ated due to bush fires, dash­ing hopes that wet­ter weather would make sea­sonal fires less cat­a­strophic than last year.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists at­tribute the er­ratic weather in the early Aus­tralian sum­mer to a La Nina pat­tern – which fea­tures strong rain – com­bined with cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Fraser Is­land, the world’s largest sand is­land, is un­der the flood warn­ing, which in­cludes urg­ing driv­ers to avoid roads where the wa­ter level is al­ready ris­ing.</p>
    <p>“These are dy­namic weather sys­tems and you should al­ways ex­pect the un­ex­pected,” se­nior flood hy­drol­o­gist Justin Robin­son said.</p>
    <p>The warn­ing comes soon af­ter Queens­land opened its bor­der to the neigh­bour­ing state fol­low­ing months of clo­sure due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have urged peo­ple trav­el­ling for end-of-year hol­i­days to ex­er­cise cau­tion since they may not be fa­mil­iar with flood­prone ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Emer­gency ser­vices have al­ready res­cued four peo­ple, in­clud­ing some from cars trapped on flooded roads, and re­ceived about 700 calls for help.</p>
    <p>Along the heav­ily pop­u­lated Gold Coast, south of Bris­bane, the au­thor­i­ties closed beaches due to dan­ger­ous surf, while emer­gency ser­vices set up sev­eral lo­ca­tions where peo­ple could stock up on sand­bags.</p>
