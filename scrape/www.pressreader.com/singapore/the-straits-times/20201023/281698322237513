    <p>An on­line chat­bot is now avail­able to those feel­ing stressed amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, to help them build men­tal re­silience and learn self care.</p>
    <p>Users are also promised anonymity when us­ing the “emo­tion­ally in­tel­li­gent” chat­bot plat­form, Wysa, which is avail­able on the lat­est ver­sion of Web app ser­vice mind­line.sg</p>
    <p>This new ver­sion was launched yes­ter­day by the Min­istry of Health Of­fice for Health­care Trans­for­ma­tion (MOHT), Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice and In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health (IMH).</p>
    <p>The web­site con­sol­i­dates ac­cess to lo­cal stress man­age­ment and cop­ing re­sources, and di­rects users to use­ful hot­line num­bers.</p>
    <p>It also has a well-be­ing self-assess­ment tool to help users match re­sources to health­care needs.</p>
    <p>IMH se­nior con­sul­tant Jimmy Lee said of the web­site: “We hope that by pro­vid­ing an anony­mous and safe space, and avail­ing users of the self-assess­ment tool with needs match­ing to re­sources, we can re­duce the bar­ri­ers to help-seek­ing, and em­power them to take the first step to self-man­age­ment and re­gain­ing their emo­tional and men­tal well-be­ing.”</p>
    <p>The agen­cies worked with health tech start-up Touchkin to bring its chat­bot Wysa – usu­ally a paid ser­vice – to the mind­line.sg site free for a year. The Wysa plat­form will also give users ac­cess to med­i­ta­tion, breath­ing and yoga ex­er­cises, as well as mo­ti­va­tional con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Users do not have to pro­vide their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Loke Wai Chiong, MOHT’s clin­i­cal di­rec­tor of pro­grammes and head of in­te­grated health pro­mo­tion, said it would con­tinue to ob­serve the use of mind­line.sg, gather in­for­ma­tion and make im­prove­ments. This could in­clude adding spe­cialised ser­vices for spe­cific pop­u­la­tion groups such as the youth, se­niors and health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Loke added: “We will also work to­wards build­ing more cul­tur­ally con­tex­tu­alised con­tent, re­spon­sive to the evolv­ing needs of the com­mu­nity. In the longer term, we hope that this in­no­va­tion can in­crease pub­lic health ca­pa­bil­ity and cre­ate high im­pact at a rel­a­tively low cost.”</p>
    <p>Mind­line.sg was first rolled out in June to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Ms E. Koh, who de­clined to give her full name, turned to mind­line.sg after los­ing her job as an ad­min­is­tra­tive man­ager when her or­gan­i­sa­tion was re­struc­tured.</p>
    <p>“I was get­ting anx­ious be­cause at my age, it could be dif­fi­cult to find a new job, es­pe­cially at a time like this. A friend rec­om­mended mind­line.sg, to help me man­age my emo­tions bet­ter,” said the 49-year-old.</p>
    <p>While seek­ing ad­vice via the web­site, Ms Koh also found out more about skills up­grad­ing and re­train­ing as well as vol­un­teer­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties. She is now think­ing of tak­ing up cour­ses in be­friend­ing, to be­come a vol­un­teer and reach out to so­cially iso­lated el­derly peo­ple.</p>
