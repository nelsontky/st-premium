    <p>Mr Kishore Mah­bubani’s ob­ser­va­tions and sug­ges­tions on China are not new (The West should let China sleep, as Napoleon ad­vised, Sept 23).</p>
    <p>In fact, in the throes of the Great De­pres­sion in the 1930s, it was also fash­ion­able to mock the fail­ings of the lib­eral democ­ra­cies. Sim­i­lar to how China’s rise has now en­thralled some, au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism was also then put forth as a more vi­able and at­trac­tive solution to the so­cio-eco­nomic ills of the time.</p>
    <p>Mr Mah­bubani’s sug­ges­tions are based on sev­eral as­sump­tions which war­rant closer ex­am­i­na­tion. First, the do­mes­tic sup­port of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) has been pred­i­cated on the con­tin­ued de­liv­ery of eco­nomic progress.</p>
    <p>Like what many gov­ern­ments of de­vel­op­ing na­tions have come to re­alise, af­ter the low-hang­ing fruit has been picked, sus­tain­ing eco­nomic devel­op­ment is no longer as easy as be­fore.</p>
    <p>As the CCP it­self is fully aware, China’s tra­di­tional eco­nomic growth model is un­sus­tain­able in the long run, both in view of the chang­ing geopo­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion and its own de­mo­graphic trends.</p>
    <p>It would be short-sighted to as­sume that the CCP, which is not sub­ject to elec­toral checks and bal­ance, would con­tinue to en­joy do­mes­tic sup­port once the econ­omy re­mains in the dol­drums.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, while it is China’s pre­rog­a­tive to try to restore its former glory, it is also the pre­rog­a­tive of other na­tions to de­cide whether they want to abide by China’s des­ig­nated peck­ing or­der in a Pax Sinica (Chi­nese peace). In that con­text, any al­lu­sion to its “cen­tury of hu­mil­i­a­tion” is as help­ful as 1930s Ger­many’s ref­er­ence to the “in­jus­tices” of the Treaty of Ver­sailles.</p>
    <p>Third, I do not think that the West is push­ing for regime change in China, but rather for China to fol­low the norms of an in­ter­na­tional or­der that it has greatly ben­e­fited from.</p>
    <p>It was also on that premise that the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity first em­braced China, when it was open­ing up and the onus should be on China to change.</p>
    <p>Many Chi­nese cit­i­zens them­selves have ob­served that China has many do­mes­tic so­cio-eco­nomic chal­lenges to deal with. Hence, wolf-war­rior diplomacy and mil­i­tary ad­ven­tur­ism are not only coun­ter­pro­duc­tive but ul­ti­mately, dele­te­ri­ous to both China and the world.</p>
    <p>This tragedy is fur­ther ex­ac­er­bated by the fact that un­like the West, where poor lead­ers can be elec­torally re­moved, the Chi­nese peo­ple have to con­tinue to live with the con­se­quences of bad lead­er­ship.</p>
