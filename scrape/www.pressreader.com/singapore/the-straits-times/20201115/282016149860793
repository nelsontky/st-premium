    <p>JR HARA­JUKU STA­TION</p>
    <p>Opened: 1924</p>
    <p>Closed: March 2020. De­mo­li­tion be­gan in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The sta­tion, with its Euro­pean half-tim­bered style, was once the old­est wooden train sta­tion in Tokyo, form­ing a nos­tal­gic back­drop to the pop­u­lar venue for youth and kawaii (cute) cul­ture that is Hara­juku’s Takeshita Street.</p>
    <p>Its modern two-storey re­place­ment, along with an ar­ti­sanal cafe, is lo­cated be­side the old sta­tion. Op­er­a­tor JR East plans to recre­ate the old fa­cade as far as pos­si­ble in a new build­ing to come up on the old site.</p>
    <p>TOSHIMA-EN THEME PARK</p>
    <p>Opened: Septem­ber 1926</p>
    <p>Closed: Aug 31, 2020</p>
    <p>The fam­ily-friendly amuse­ment park com­prised more than 30 at­trac­tions, in­clud­ing a wooden carousel that was made in Ger­many in 1907, as well as the world’s first lazy river pool, which opened in 1965.</p>
    <p>Long lines formed on its last day, with many rem­i­nisc­ing about how the park had wit­nessed their com­ing-of-age cer­e­monies and first dates.</p>
    <p>It is mak­ing way for a new Harry Pot­ter theme park that is slated to open in the first half of 2023.</p>
    <p>JIMBOCHO BUILD­ING AN­NEX</p>
    <p>Opened: 1930</p>
    <p>Closed: 2018. De­mo­li­tion be­gan in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The “pen­cil build­ing” had a fa­cade of brown scratch tiles and arched win­dows with a ter­ra­cotta bor­der. Ar­chi­tects have pe­ti­tioned the de­vel­op­ers of the new build­ing to re­tain some char­ac­ter­is­tics of the old struc­ture.</p>
    <p>SHIBUYA TOKYU TOYOKO DE­PART­MENT STORE</p>
    <p>Opened: 1934</p>
    <p>Closed: March 2020, though the base­ment food hall re­mains open</p>
    <p>The Shibuya land­mark, di­rectly con­nected to the train sta­tion and fac­ing the Hachiko dog statue, is be­ing re­de­vel­oped as part of a ma­jor project that will see the whole of Shibuya trans­formed by 2027.</p>
    <p>TSUK­IJI IN­NER FISH MAR­KET</p>
    <p>Opened: 1935</p>
    <p>Closed: Oc­to­ber 2018</p>
    <p>Tsuk­iji, once the world’s largest whole­sale fish mar­ket, was de­mol­ished, with the space to be used as a trans­port hub for the Olympics. The mar­ket has moved to a less-ac­ces­si­ble but more modern fa­cil­ity in Toyosu.</p>
    <p>HARA MU­SEUM OF CON­TEM­PO­RARY ART</p>
    <p>Com­pleted: 1938</p>
    <p>To be per­ma­nently closed on Jan 11, 2021</p>
    <p>First com­mis­sioned as a pri­vate res­i­dence for the Meiji-era in­dus­tri­al­ist Ku­nizo Hara, it was con­verted into Ja­pan’s first con­tem­po­rary art mu­seum in 1979.</p>
    <p>It is a rare ex­am­ple of a West­ern-style res­i­dence of that era, with its Art Deco style fea­tur­ing curved walls and tur­rets and par­quet floors as well as a sculp­ture gar­den.</p>
