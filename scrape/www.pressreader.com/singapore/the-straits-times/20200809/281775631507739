    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing and the threat of Covid-19 meant a whole new set of chal­lenges for or­gan­is­ers of this year’s pa­rade. The Sun­day Times sits down with the key per­son­nel bring­ing today’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade to Sin­ga­pore­ans across the is­land.</p>
    <p>The com­man­der of this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) has a trick to keep his white face mask in place while shout­ing his thun­der­ous com­mands: cos­metic tape.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pa­rade, Lieu­tenan­tColonel (LTC) Ni­cholas Ong will tape a small strip to the apex of his nose to pre­vent his mask from slid­ing down. “At first, I was a lit­tle bit ap­pre­hen­sive about the mask, be­cause I was re­ally afraid of how the pro­jec­tion of the com­mands would be like. We tried a few masks and found the most suit­able one that’s light and doesn’t im­pede the shout­ing of my com­mands,” the 38-year-old pa­rade com­man­der told the me­dia dur­ing the NDP 2020 re­hearsal on July 26.</p>
    <p>“It may not look like it, but I’m quite ner­vous, so the ad­van­tage of this mask is that it helps me reg­u­late my breath­ing,” he added. LTC Ong was the re­serve pa­rade com­man­der last year.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing a face mask while stand­ing un­der the hot sun is just one of the chal­lenges faced by par­tic­i­pants in this year’s pa­rade at the Padang, held amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An­other change due to Covid-19: Par­tic­i­pant num­bers have been re­duced to about 300 in to­tal, down from the usual 5,000 to 6,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>De­spite a scaled-down pa­rade, the pa­rade reg­i­men­tal sergeant ma­jor, Mas­ter War­rant Of­fi­cer (MWO) David Ling, 43, said train­ing was not any eas­ier. For in­stance, keep­ing a safe dis­tance be­tween par­tic­i­pants makes it more dif­fi­cult to achieve uni­for­mity dur­ing march­ing.</p>
    <p>Con­tin­gent par­tic­i­pants will stand at least 1m apart from one an­other, in­stead of the usual 0.4m to 0.5m. “My chal­lenge is how to get the pa­rade in a straight and or­gan­ised man­ner,” said MWO Ling.</p>
    <p>He tried on six masks “of dif­fer­ent forms and shapes” to find the best fit for the con­tin­gent.</p>
    <p>“Most im­por­tant is the breatha­bil­ity, be­cause I’m con­cerned whether the par­tic­i­pants can breathe prop­erly and stay wear­ing it through­out the pa­rade,” he said. “We trained pro­gres­sively to get our­selves ac­cli­ma­tised to hav­ing a mask on in this heat and hu­mid­ity.” Pa­rade train­ing started only around the end of June, he added.</p>
    <p>The pa­rade com­prises the State Colours and four Guard of Hon­our con­tin­gents formed by the army, navy, air force and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF). Each con­tin­gent’s size was re­duced by half. A com­bined mil­i­tary band from the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces and SPF will usher in the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pa­rade, LTC Ong will lead a spe­cial salute to hon­our front-line fight­ers.</p>
    <p>While this year’s pa­rade may not be as packed as pre­vi­ous years, MWO Ling said the goal is to put up a “solemn, dig­ni­fied and re­spectable pa­rade”. He said: “What we want to put on show on Aug 9 is a pa­rade that show­cases Sin­ga­pore’s strength, unity and spirit to the na­tion.”</p>
