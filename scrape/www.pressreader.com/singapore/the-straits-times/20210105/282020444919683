    <p>Straits Times as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Chua Mui Hoong’s lessons from the year of the coro­n­avirus (Home truths in the year of coro­n­avirus, Jan 1) hit close to home for me, es­pe­cially the part on the plight of mi­grant work­ers. Mi­grant work­ers be­long to a side of Sin­ga­pore that is of­ten un­seen. They are the driv­ing force be­hind many of Sin­ga­pore’s achieve­ments, es­pe­cially in the con­struc­tion and marine in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>But many pro­tec­tions avail­able to other cat­e­gories of work pass hold­ers are not avail­able to those un­der the cat­e­gory of work per­mits for for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>Their visas are for semi-skilled work­ers usu­ally from the lower eco­nomic and ed­u­ca­tional strata, and they are of­ten ex­ploited by com­pa­nies and mid­dle­men. Most of these work­ers are semi-lit­er­ate, and might not be able to un­der­stand or claim their rights, and reg­u­la­tions in this area are crafted as em­ployer or agent obli­ga­tions. How­ever, this ap­proach is sorely lim­ited.</p>
    <p>While other work pass hold­ers are able to switch em­ploy­ers af­ter giv­ing no­tice to their com­pany, these work­ers are tied to their em­ploy­ers and can­not switch un­til the em­ployer con­sents.</p>
    <p>While there are min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salaries re­quired for some of the other cat­e­gories of work passes, there is no such re­quire­ment for this cat­e­gory. Al­though this is in­tended to lower bar­ri­ers for these work­ers to en­ter Sin­ga­pore, this is in­stead ex­ploited by mid­dle­men who ag­gres­sively ne­go­ti­ate wages down, es­pe­cially by cit­ing the ad­di­tional cost paid by the em­ployer to fur­nish the se­cu­rity bond re­quired for some of the sec­tors.</p>
    <p>All of this is in ad­di­tion to work­place safety is­sues, ac­com­mo­da­tion that is at times be­low par and ir­reg­u­lar wages. Due to fear of ter­mi­na­tion, de­por­ta­tion and con­tracts they scarcely un­der­stand, the work­ers sel­dom com­plain.</p>
    <p>There are a few non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions such as Tran­sient Work­ers Count Too that are work­ing on im­prov­ing con­di­tions for these work­ers and have shared heart­break­ing sto­ries of ex­ploita­tion.</p>
    <p>As Ms Chua rightly points out, if this year has taught us any­thing, it is that “there is no us and them... There is just us and we’re all in it to­gether”. It is time to cor­rect this aber­ra­tion. Let us start “see­ing” this un­seen force be­hind our achieve­ments and not ben­e­fit from ex­ploita­tive prac­tices.</p>
