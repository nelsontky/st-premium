    <p>The im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on jobs and the cost of liv­ing were con­sid­er­a­tions for Sin­ga­pore­ans as they headed to the polls in July, a sur­vey of the gen­eral elec­tion re­sults has found.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity, too, was a key con­cern among younger and bet­ter-ed­u­cated vot­ers.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party is still seen as the most cred­i­ble po­lit­i­cal party, but there was a drop in the pro­por­tion of re­spon­dents from all age groups who felt this way.</p>
    <p>The per­ceived cred­i­bil­ity of the op­po­si­tion Work­ers’ Party rose among vot­ers of all age groups.</p>
    <p>These are among the key find­ings in the poll done by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies, in which 4,027 vot­ing-age Sin­ga­pore­ans took part.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion have led some to spec­u­late that Sin­ga­pore could be headed to­wards a two-party po­lit­i­cal sys­tem, but po­lit­i­cal ob­server Lam Peng Er thinks it is un­likely.</p>
    <p>“We are more likely to see the emer­gence of a 11/ party sys­tem</p>
    <p>2 within the next decade or two,” said the se­nior re­search fel­low from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s East Asian In­sti­tute, re­fer­ring to Ja­pan’s party sys­tem be­tween 1955 and 1993.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on a panel dur­ing an on­line forum yes­ter­day or­gan­ised by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies on its post-elec­tion sur­vey, Dr Lam said the dom­i­nant party in Ja­pan dur­ing those years was the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP). The smaller Ja­pan So­cial­ist Party made up a “per­ma­nent op­po­si­tion”, con­sis­tently win­ning about half the num­ber of seats held by the LDP.</p>
    <p>It is con­ceiv­able, he said, that the Work­ers’ Party (WP) in Sin­ga­pore could be­come a prom­i­nent party in Par­lia­ment with a sub­stan­tial num­ber of seats, while not dis­plac­ing the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP). Many vot­ers here would wel­come this sce­nario, he added.</p>
    <p>Another pan­el­list, in­de­pen­dent scholar Derek da Cunha, said GE2020 showed that only a mod­er­ate op­po­si­tion party that is not too con­fronta­tional can suc­ceed in tak­ing seats away from the PAP.</p>
    <p>This has held true for three decades, he said, cit­ing the rel­a­tive suc­cess of the Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party as a mod­er­ate party un­der its founder Chiam See Tong. The party later moved in a more con­fronta­tional di­rec­tion, “de­stroy­ing op­po­si­tion chances for a gen­er­a­tion”, he added.</p>
    <p>“(Dur­ing GE2020), the WP re­ferred to it­self, as it did in GE2015, as ra­tio­nal, re­spon­si­ble and re­spectable. There is no fourth R; the WP has no rad­i­cal agenda.”</p>
    <p>Dr da Cunha said the WP’s elec­toral strat­egy has been ef­fec­tive, not­ing it con­cen­trated its ef­forts in the east of Sin­ga­pore and ap­pealed to a broad spec­trum of vot­ers across dif­fer­ent de­mo­graph­ics.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal sci­ence pro­fes­sor Chu Yun-han of the Na­tional Tai­wan Univer­sity shared find­ings from the Asian Barom­e­ter Sur­vey, where he</p>
    <p>is di­rec­tor and prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor. The pan­el­list said Sin­ga­pore ranks higher than many of its neigh­bours in ar­eas such as the pro­por­tion of ci­ti­zens who see their coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal regime as le­git­i­mate, and who be­lieve the coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem is ca­pa­ble of solv­ing the prob­lems it faces.</p>
    <p>He said Sin­ga­pore­ans and many of their Asian neigh­bours tend to view democ­racy in terms of whether a sys­tem de­liv­ers good gov­er­nance and so­cial eq­uity, rather than fea­tures such as free­dom and lib­erty.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of fair­ness in pol­i­cy­mak­ing and whether can­di­dates were seen as be­ing fair also emerged as a key con­cern, the sur­vey found.</p>
    <p>Dr Lam cited two events dur­ing the GE2020 cam­paign that re­flected these concerns: One was the with­drawal of PAP can­di­date Ivan Lim fol­low­ing al­le­ga­tions of his elit­ist be­hav­iour, which re­flected fears of un­equal treat­ment of elites and non-elites. Another was the po­lice re­port made against the WP’s Sengkang GRC can­di­date and even­tual MP Raeesah Khan. He added that the sys­tem “must re­main fair, and be seen as fair by the masses, to main­tain na­tional co­he­sion”.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found an uptick in re­spon­dents who said they were con­cerned with “post-ma­te­rial” is­sues like fair­ness and po­lit­i­cal plu­ral­ism.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dr da Cunha said Sin­ga­pore­ans’ paramount concerns con­tinue to be ma­te­rial “bread and but­ter” is­sues like jobs and the cost of liv­ing. This was ac­cen­tu­ated dur­ing the pan­demic, he added.</p>
