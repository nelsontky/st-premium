    <p>More than 6,000 of the 27,000 staff from the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) Group have taken no-pay leave of vary­ing lengths to help the com­pany cope with the col­lapse in air travel due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, more than 1,700 em­ploy­ees, in­clud­ing ground staff, pi­lots and cabin crew, have signed up for vol­un­teer po­si­tions and jobs in ex­ter­nal or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The SIA Group – which com­prises SIA, re­gional arm SilkAir and bud­get car­rier Scoot – dis­closed the fig­ures to The Straits Times last Friday.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said it has been ar­rang­ing tem­po­rary and sec­ondary job place­ments for its staff.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese in­clude am­bas­sador roles and op­por­tu­ni­ties at public trans­port sta­tions, so­cial ser­vice of­fices and hospi­tals, for ex­am­ple,” said the spokesman. “Many of our crew have also vol­un­teered with var­i­ous roles within the com­pany.”</p>
    <p>Staff can ap­ply for the ex­ter­nal roles through SIA’s em­ployee sup­port por­tal.</p>
    <p>They can also tap on­line fi­nan­cial, men­tal and phys­i­cal well­ness pro­grammes if needed.</p>
    <p>The no-pay leave scheme and let­ting staff seek sec­ondary em­ploy­ment are part of sev­eral cost-cut­ting mea­sures the air­line has in­tro­duced as the pan­demic rages on.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that the SIA</p>
    <p>Group’s pi­lots and cabin crew who are not fly­ing still get their ba­sic pay, but they do not get flight al­lowances which sub­stan­tially in­crease their pay.</p>
    <p>For staff who are now at­tached to other or­gan­i­sa­tions, it is un­der­stood that their pay varies.</p>
    <p>SIA helps to sup­ple­ment the salaries of those earn­ing less than their ba­sic pay, which can be around $1,500 for a cabin crew mem­ber.</p>
    <p>The SIA Group, un­like sev­eral other air­lines, has thus far man­aged to stave off job cuts, with the help of fund­ing from Te­masek and the Govern­ment’s Jobs Sup­port Scheme.</p>
    <p>But it is cur­rently op­er­at­ing at just 7 per cent of its sched­uled ca­pac­ity as com­pared with be­fore the pan­demic. Some cabin crew have yet to take to the air in months.</p>
    <p>Last month, it re­ported a $1.12 bil­lion net loss in the quar­ter ended June 30, its largest quar­terly loss on record.</p>
    <p>Air travel de­mand is ex­pected to re­main low for the fore­see­able fu­ture, with the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion say­ing that it will be un­til 2024 be­fore de­mand re­turns to last year’s lev­els.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have said the var­i­ous mea­sures, which in­clude rais­ing $11 bil­lion so far this fi­nan­cial year, will help the SIA Group – but not likely to the ex­tent that it can avoid even­tual job cuts. This is so given that air­lines are over­staffed for cur­rent de­mand lev­els, and a quick re­cov­ery is nowhere in sight.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s other air­line, Jet­star Asia, an­nounced in June that it was cut­ting about 26 per cent – or about 180 – of its jobs.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of its re­main­ing staff have also been put on fur­lough at least un­til the end of this year, and are cur­rently re­ceiv­ing sus­te­nance pay.</p>
    <p>Like the SIA Group, Jet­star Asia has also de­ployed staff to ex­ter­nal roles. It told ST last month that more than 300 staff have been de­ployed to roles in public and pri­vate sec­tors to help fight Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the SIA Group said its flight staff – about 3,200 pi­lots and al­most 11,000 cabin crew – have kept their skills cur­rent in spite of the dras­tic fall in flights.</p>
    <p>Its pi­lots are now us­ing more elearn­ing re­sources on top of sim­u­la­tor train­ing. Those who have not flown for a while are given ad­di­tional train­ing.</p>
    <p>Pi­lots must then un­dergo the re­quired pro­fi­ciency checks be­fore re­turn­ing to op­er­a­tional fly­ing.</p>
    <p>For cadet pi­lots, ground train­ing con­tin­ues, although sim­u­la­tor train­ing has been sus­pended.</p>
    <p>As for cabin crew, they have been un­der­go­ing a reg­u­lar on­line pro­gramme ap­proved by the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, said the SIA Group spokesman.</p>
    <p>She added: “Cabin crew are also re­quired to com­plete and pass on­line op­er­a­tional and fleet re­cency train­ing and tests to en­sure their qual­i­fi­ca­tions re­main cur­rent dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“They are also sched­uled to at­tend ground train­ing cour­ses and must pass all re­quired safety drills.”</p>
    <p>Staff will be pre­pared, as slightly more planes from SIA Group and Jet­star Asia will be tak­ing to the skies in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>SIA said its pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity will in­crease to about 8 per cent of pre-Covid-19 lev­els by end-Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Jet­star Asia, mean­while, will fly to five more des­ti­na­tions, in­clud­ing Jakarta, from to­day.</p>
