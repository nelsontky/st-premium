    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) has re­peated its call for those with cred­i­ble ev­i­dence about the al­leged leader of a de­viant re­li­gious group here to come for­ward and aid its in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Those with re­li­able ev­i­dence such as e-mails, record­ings and other doc­u­ments and who are will­ing to tes­tify should make their sub­mis­sions to it be­fore Dec 11, Muis said in a sec­ond state­ment on the mat­ter yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Muis un­der­stands there are fam­i­lies and i ndi­vid­u­als who have been af­fected by the al­leged group.</p>
    <p>“We are reach­ing out to af­fected in­di­vid­u­als who have ap­proached us on the mat­ter to ren­der sup­port and as­sis­tance,” said the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who are able to help Muis can e-mail info@muis.gov.sg or present ev­i­dence in per­son at the Sin­ga­pore Is­lamic Hub.</p>
    <p>Muis is work­ing with the au­thor­i­ties to re-in­ves­ti­gate the self­styled prophet, after The Straits Times’ ex­pose on the de­viant group was pub­lished on Nov 9.</p>
    <p>The man at the cen­tre of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion is a for­mer mas­sage ther­a­pist in his 50s.</p>
    <p>It is be­lieved that he has led the group, whose fe­male fol­low­ers help run a small restau­rant and an event man­age­ment business, for the last 15 years.</p>
    <p>Among his teach­ings, the man pro­fesses to be Prophet Muham­mad, per­mits gam­bling to help needy Mus­lims, and as­pires to have 13 spir­i­tual wives.</p>
    <p>ST’s four-month-long in­ves­ti­ga­tion doc­u­mented the ex­is­tence of five highly ed­u­cated women, who were de­scribed by the group’s for­mer fol­low­ers as the man’s spir­i­tual wives.</p>
    <p>Four of the five women had divorced their hus­bands be­tween 2010 and 2017.</p>
    <p>The men were ac­cused of mis­treat­ing their for­mer wives and not giv­ing them al­lowances.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day evening, ST’s video story on the group has gar­nered 468,000 views on Face­book, in­clud­ing 4,800 shares and 1,300 com­ments.</p>
    <p>Muis’ first state­ment on the mat­ter on Nov 10 re­vealed that it was first alerted to the case in 2018.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil had then is­sued a for­mal ad­vi­sory to the man, who is not a qual­i­fied or reg­is­tered re­li­gious teacher un­der the Asati­zah Recog­ni­tion Scheme (ARS), to cease his re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Muis said in its lat­est state­ment: “We would like to re­mind the com­mu­nity of the im­por­tance of seek­ing re­li­gious guid­ance and knowl­edge from cred­i­ble and recog­nised asati­zah.”</p>
    <p>In the last three weeks, Friday ser­mons at Sin­ga­pore’s mosques have fo­cused on the dan­gers of de­viant re­li­gious teach­ings and how to spot them.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that as part of its in­ves­ti­ga­tion, Muis seeks to find out if the man had con­tin­ued teach­ing his de­viant re­li­gious be­liefs de­spite be­ing told to stop by the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>A for­mer male fol­lower of the group, Mr Ah­mad (not his real name), told ST he hoped Muis would ex­pe­dite its in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hammed (not his real name), a for­mer hus­band of one of the self-styled prophet’s spir­i­tual wives, said he is re­lieved that the Mus­lim com­mu­nity is now “aware of the dan­gers of some­one teach­ing Is­lam with­out ARS cer­ti­fi­ca­tion”.</p>
