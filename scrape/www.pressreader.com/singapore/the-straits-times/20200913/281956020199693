    <p>MUGELLO (Italy) • The Mugello cir­cuit in the hills of Scarpe­ria is a new set­ting for For­mula One, but yes­ter­day’s qual­i­fy­ing for the Tus­can Grand Prix ended with an all-too-fa­mil­iar face on pole.</p>
    <p>Mercedes’ Lewis Hamil­ton was quick­est in Q3 in 1min 15.144sec, five-hun­dredths of a sec­ond faster than team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond row was filled by the Red Bulls of Max Ver­stap­pen and Alex Al­bon, the lat­ter with one of his best per­for­mances of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>It was Hamil­ton’s sev­enth pole in eight races this year, as Mercedes con­tin­ued their dom­i­nant run to nine poles out of nine this sea­son with an eighth con­sec­u­tive fron­trow lock­out.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas had been fastest in all three prac­tice ses­sions, but he was un­able to main­tain his su­pe­ri­or­ity over the Bri­ton in the de­ci­sive hour – al­beit his sec­ond run was af­fected by yel­low flags af­ter Este­ban Ocon spun in his Re­nault.</p>
    <p>Hosts Fer­rari are cel­e­brat­ing their 1,000th F1 race at Mugello but had a mixed af­ter­noon, with Charles Le­clerc in fifth spot but Se­bas­tian Vet­tel start­ing down the grid in 14th.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a very tough week­end,” said Hamil­ton. “It’s a re­ally chal­leng­ing cir­cuit. You saw Valt­teri was quicker than me all day yes­ter­day and even this morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been work­ing hard in the back­ground to im­prove on my lines and set up and the en­gi­neers and me­chan­ics did a great job, so fi­nally I got the lap that I needed.</p>
    <p>“The track is crazy. You go through Turns 6, 7, 8, 9 at</p>
    <p>170-180mph and the G-force we’re pulling is in­sane, it gets more and more as you go through.”</p>
    <p>Bot­tas felt cer­tain he would have im­proved his time on his sec­ond fi­nal run, but for the flags.</p>
    <p>“I def­i­nitely had more,” he said. “I know I could have done bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>His de­spair was a sharp con­trast with Le­clerc’s de­light.</p>
    <p>“I’m very happy with the lap over</p>
    <p>all,” he said. “P5 is higher than our ex­pec­ta­tions, so we’re very happy.</p>
    <p>“Monza and Spa were very dis­ap­point­ing. The bal­ance was good to­day and gave me con­fi­dence. In the end we made it hap­pen.”</p>
