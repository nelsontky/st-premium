    <p>The ex­treme mar­ket volatil­ity trig­gered by the pan­demic is tempt­ing more and more peo­ple to chance their arm amid roller-coast­ing share prices, but ex­perts warn in­vestors, es­pe­cially first-timers, to tread care­fully.</p>
    <p>The temp­ta­tion is cer­tainly strong with some shares fall­ing to lows not seen for years, but buy­ers who charge in look­ing for a quick buck with­out do­ing prior re­search could find them­selves on the los­ing end.</p>
    <p>MAR­KET VOLATIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Ms Evy Wee, DBS Bank’s head of fi­nan­cial plan­ning and per­sonal in­vest­ing, says: “The jump in in­vestors since March may be un­prece­dented but it is not a new phe­nom­e­non. A cri­sis presents an op­por­tu­nity for in­vestors to build their in­vest­ment port­fo­lios in a more af­ford­able man­ner.”</p>
    <p>She notes that dur­ing the mar­ket crash in late March, in­vestors who were fi­nan­cially well pre­pared seized the chance to buy stocks at rel­a­tively lower prices, es­pe­cially from peo­ple who were spooked enough to flee the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“His­tory has shown that mar­kets have of­ten bounced back from crashes, al­low­ing those who pur­chased as­sets at bar­gain prices the abil­ity to earn bet­ter-than-av­er­age re­turns,” she adds.</p>
    <p>A DBS study showed that the av­er­age post-re­ces­sion bull mar­ket re­cov­ery could give a solid 141 per cent re­turn over a pe­riod of 381 days.</p>
    <p>“The stock mar­ket be­hav­iour in the past four re­ces­sions has been on the side of the ‘risk-on’ in­vestor, as­sum­ing one has the hold­ing power to ride out any re­main­ing near-term price un­cer­tainty and sit through a po­ten­tial re­cov­ery over the next 12 months or be­yond,” she says.</p>
    <p>Mr David Ger­ald, pres­i­dent of the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), or Sias, says there are also bar­gain hunters look­ing to make money from buy­ing un­der­val­ued stocks.</p>
    <p>“Bar­gain hunt­ing is fine, but one should not con­fuse price with value,” he warns.</p>
    <p>“Since mid-March when the pan­demic’s se­ri­ous­ness first be­came clear, the big­gest stum­bling block has been the huge un­cer­tainty about the ex­act im­pact the cri­sis will have on economies and earn­ings, and this is trans­lat­ing to a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in volatil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald adds that risk has in­creased sub­stan­tially, given the un­set­tled times we find our­selves in: “The sheer un­pre­dictabil­ity of what the fu­ture holds and what the next de­vel­op­ment is means that even if prices may look at­trac­tive, risks have in­creased sharply.”</p>
    <p>OCBC Se­cu­ri­ties trad­ing strate­gist Sa­muel Wong says the global mar­ket volatil­ity is not unique to this year’s sit­u­a­tion, but such un­cer­tainty has in­ten­si­fied to a larger de­gree and mag­ni­tude in re­cent years on the back of highly un­ex­pected – “black swan” – events.</p>
    <p>He also notes that ma­jor “black swan” events such as the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome out­break and Brexit show that ex­treme and abrupt sell­ing mo­men­tum means stock mar­ket val­u­a­tions can drop to un­prece­dented low lev­els.</p>
    <p>“His­tory has taught us that the risk pre­mium, es­pe­cially in the midst of ev­ery ma­jor mar­ket cat­a­strophic event, should not be ig­nored,” he warns. “Be­ing able to lever­age a great in­vest­ment op­por­tu­nity dur­ing a cri­sis is what all in­vestors and traders hope for, but not ev­ery­one can be so for­tu­nate.”</p>
    <p>He adds that in­vestors have to take the time and ef­fort to study their op­tions and speak with ex­pe­ri­enced in­vestors or ad­vis­ers where pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>WHAT TO BE AWARE OF</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald urges re­tail in­vestors to be wary and con­sider how vi­o­lently stocks have re­acted over the past months to events such as oil fu­ture con­tracts crash­ing below zero, sup­pos­edly en­cour­ag­ing drug tri­als that may lead to a vac­cine, and an­nounce­ments by cen­tral banks on stim­u­lus mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Each of th­ese has led to large swings in stock prices,” he notes.</p>
    <p>“Over at Wall Street, it is now be­com­ing in­creas­ingly com­mon to wit­ness 2 per cent to 3 per cent daily moves in the Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age and the S&P 500. Th­ese large move­ments then spill over here, with the re­sult that the Straits Times In­dex reg­u­larly un­der­goes big move­ments of its own.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald also sug­gests that in­vestors should avoid trad­ing fre­quently or try­ing to time en­tries and ex­its.</p>
    <p>“Stud­ies have re­peat­edly shown that it might be pos­si­ble to beat the mar­ket a few times, but to do this con­sis­tently over a pro­longed pe­riod is ex­tremely dif­fi­cult.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, an un­ex­pect­edly large plunge on Wall Street will trans­late into a sim­i­lar move­ment on the Straits Times In­dex the next day.</p>
    <p>This can then lead to panic sell­ing, which can then trig­ger fear in an in­vestor who might have just bought a short while ear­lier.</p>
    <p>OCBC’s Mr Wong says in­vestors must do their home­work when it comes to to­day’s cap­i­tal mar­kets: “In­vestors need to be clear of their trad­ing ob­jec­tives – which can be to cap­ture the short-term mar­ket swings, or buy stocks that have the growth po­ten­tial for longer-term cap­i­tal gains. With th­ese in mind, they can then plan and se­lect the stocks ac­cord­ingly.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore ( MAS) notes that all in­vest­ments carry risks of losses.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors are en­cour­aged to main­tain a long-term per­spec­tive on in­vest­ments, and guard against in­vest­ing be­yond their knowl­edge, risk ap­petite and fi­nan­cial re­sources,” he says.</p>
    <p>The MAS spokesman adds that be­fore in­vest­ing, peo­ple should first con­sider whether they have set aside enough money for daily ex­penses and emer­gen­cies, and if they al­ready have ba­sic health and life in­sur­ance cov­er­age in place.</p>
    <p>They should also en­sure that they stay di­ver­si­fied i n their i nvest­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Adrian Loh, UOB Kay Hian’s head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore, notes that re­tail in­vestors should be care­ful in a mar­ket en­vi­ron­ment where ev­ery­thing might seem bullish and rosy.</p>
    <p>“Mar­kets never go up in a straight line, so each in­vestor has to recog­nise mar­ket risk as well as the in­di­vid­ual stock’s risk,” he notes.</p>
    <p>“Form a the­sis i n your mind about why you want to buy a cer­tain stock and if there is ap­par­ent neg­a­tive news, does that change your the­sis? Don’t in­vest based on tips from friends. The key mantra in in­vest­ing your money is to do your own re­search.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Chia, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank’s Sin­ga­pore head of man­aged in­vest­ments and eq­ui­ties, adds that in­vestors should also be aware that eq­uity mar­kets can be ex­tremely fast mov­ing and volatile: “Many in­vestors, even savvy ones, have been caught un­aware at times.</p>
    <p>“In volatile times, many economies are in stress and we’ve seen an in­crease in cor­po­rate ac­tion ac­tiv­ity be­ing un­der­taken by com­pa­nies, such as stock splits, rights is­sues and delist­ings, for in­stance.”</p>
    <p>He adds that in­vestors should also fa­mil­iarise them­selves with the com­pa­nies they in­vest in, and reg­u­larly look out for an­nounce­ments on ex­change web­sites.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors should also be aware of the mar­kets they are in­vest­ing in; there are dif­fer­ences in trad­ing hours, fees, rules and reg­u­la­tions across each of the ex­changes.”</p>
    <p>DO­ING THE GROUND­WORK</p>
    <p>Get­ting up to speed be­fore jump­ing into a mar­ket is vi­tal for in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change notes that it has seen a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in participat­ion in its in­vestor ed­u­ca­tion pro­grammes since they moved com­pletely on­line in March amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The num­bers in April and May more than dou­bled from the usual level, the ex­change said.</p>
    <p>The SGXIn­vest Tele­gram Chan­nel, which was launched in early April to of­fer daily broad­casts of in­vestor ed­u­ca­tion and re­search con­tent, has al­ready reg­is­tered 13,600 sub­scribers.</p>
    <p>StanChart’s Mr Chia adds that do­ing re­search be­fore act­ing on each in­vest­ment de­ci­sion is vi­tal: “In­vestors should an­a­lyse the fi­nan­cial in­stru­ment and the un­der­ly­ing en­tity they are in­vest­ing in, so they have bet­ter aware­ness and un­der­stand­ing of the as­so­ci­ated risks.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts also rec­om­mend that peo­ple who are new to on­line share deal­ing read up on eq­uity trad­ing ba­sics from the many re­sources avail­able on the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>DBS’ Ms Wee says those with lit­tle in­vest­ment knowl­edge can spend time on ac­quir­ing that un­der­stand­ing while build­ing an in­vest­ment port­fo­lio, sim­i­lar to study­ing for an ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“Take the time to un­der­stand the var­i­ous fi­nan­cial met­rics used to eval­u­ate a stock and the wide range of in­vest­ment prod­ucts. Ded­i­cate some time to reading books and ar­ti­cles on in­vest­ing and keep­ing up with the lat­est busi­ness news,” she sug­gests.</p>
    <p>“If you are in­ter­ested in stocks in a par­tic­u­lar sec­tor, make sure you do your due dili­gence in un­der­stand­ing how they are val­ued, read up on sec­tor trends as well as the out­look of the com­pany you are in­ter­ested in.</p>
    <p>“Keep­ing up with the lat­est busi­ness news as well as reading an­a­lyst re­ports can help you in get­ting a bet­ter idea of their out­look.”</p>
    <p>RECOG­NISE RISK</p>
    <p>Mar­kets never go up in a straight line, so each in­vestor has to recog­nise mar­ket risk as well as the in­di­vid­ual stock’s risk. Form a the­sis in your mind about why you want to buy a cer­tain stock and if there is ap­par­ent neg­a­tive news, does that change your the­sis?</p>
