    <p>Jobs Sup­port Scheme</p>
    <p>Firms can get up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages for each lo­cal worker sub­sidised. Sec­tors more badly hit by the pan­demic get more help. The scheme was ex­tended to cover wages in Au­gust, and will ex­pire after that.</p>
    <p>For­eign Worker Levy waiver and re­bates</p>
    <p>The waiver and re­bate was ini­tially ex­tended to July for busi­nesses that could not re­sume on-site op­er­a­tions after the cir­cuit breaker. Ear­lier this month, the waiver was again ex­tended to De­cem­ber for firms in the con­struc­tion, marine ship­yard and process sec­tors. The re­bate will also be ex­tended to Septem­ber for firms in these sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Rental re­lief frame­work</p>
    <p>Small and medium-sized enterprise­s got rental waivers borne equally by the Gov­ern­ment and land­lords. Those in qual­i­fy­ing com­mer­cial prop­er­ties got a to­tal of four months of waivers, cov­er­ing the pe­riod April to July. Those in in­dus­trial or of­fice prop­er­ties got two months, for April and May.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 Sup­port Grant</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who lost their jobs, were placed on in­vol­un­tary no-pay leave for three con­sec­u­tive months or had a pay cut of at least 30 per cent due to the pan­demic are el­i­gi­ble for this grant, which pro­vides up to $800 a month for three months. Ap­pli­ca­tions are open un­til Sept 30.</p>
