    <p>FORT BREGANCON (France) • An emer­gency donor con­fer­ence for blast-stricken Lebanon has raised pledges worth nearly €253 mil­lion (S$409 mil­lion) for im­me­di­ate hu­man­i­tar­ian re­lief, the French pres­i­dency said.</p>
    <p>Those com­mit­ments would not be con­di­tional on po­lit­i­cal or in­sti­tu­tional reform, Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s of­fice said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>There were also pledges made for longer-term sup­port that would de­pend on changes brought in by the au­thor­i­ties, the El­y­see Palace said.</p>
    <p>World pow­ers promised not to fail the Le­banese as their cap­i­tal, Beirut, re­cov­ers from the mas­sive ex­plo­sion at the port that killed 158 peo­ple and de­stroyed swathes of the city last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Lebanon was al­ready mired in po­lit­i­cal and fi­nan­cial cri­sis be­fore the blast. But for­eign coun­tries have de­manded trans­parency over how the aid is used, wary of writ­ing blank cheques to a gov­ern­ment viewed by its own peo­ple as deeply cor­rupt. Some are con­cerned about the in­flu­ence of Iran through the Shi’ite group Hizbol­lah. The “as­sis­tance should be timely, suf­fi­cient and con­sis­tent with the needs of the Le­banese peo­ple... and di­rectly de­liv­ered to the Le­banese pop­u­la­tion, with ut­most ef­fi­ciency and trans­parency”, the fi­nal com­mu­nique stated.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron, who vis­ited Beirut last Thurs­day, hosted the con­fer­ence by video-link, and in his open­ing re­marks urged par­tic­i­pat­ing na­tions to put aside their dif­fer­ences and sup­port the Le­banese peo­ple. The in­ter­na­tional re­sponse should be co­or­di­nated by the United Na­tions in Lebanon, he added.</p>
    <p>The of­fer of as­sis­tance in­cluded sup­port for an im­par­tial, cred­i­ble and in­de­pen­dent in­quiry into the blast. Pub­lic anger over the ex­plo­sion has prompted some Le­banese to call for a re­volt to top­ple their po­lit­i­cal leaders. Many say the blast high­lighted the neg­li­gence of a cor­rupt po­lit­i­cal elite.</p>
    <p>“Our role is to be by their side,” Mr Macron said from his sum­mer re­treat on the French Riviera.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump told the con­fer­ence the United States was ready to con­tinue pro­vid­ing aid to help the Le­banese, the White House said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent called for calm in Lebanon and ac­knowl­edged the le­git­i­mate calls of peace­ful protesters for trans­parency, reform and ac­count­abil­ity,” the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump later said the US would send ad­di­tional planes loaded with med­i­cal sup­plies, food and wa­ter and would give sub­stan­tial aid to Lebanon, though he de­clined to give a dol­lar fig­ure. “We haven’t given a num­ber, but it will be sub­stan­tial. On a hu­man­i­tar­ian ba­sis, we have to do it,” Mr Trump told re­porters in Mor­ris­town, New Jersey.</p>
