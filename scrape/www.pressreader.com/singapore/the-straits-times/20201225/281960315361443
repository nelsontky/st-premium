    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ve­toed a bi­par­ti­san de­fence pol­icy Bill and raised the prospect that the coun­try could face a gov­ern­ment shut­down dur­ing a pan­demic, stir­ring new tur­moil in Wash­ing­ton as he headed to Florida for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>An­gry at his fel­low Repub­li­cans in Con­gress, Mr Trump sought to re­fash­ion two com­plex pieces of leg­is­la­tion that passed Con­gress by wide, bi­par­ti­san mar­gins af­ter months of ne­go­ti­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump fol­lowed through on a threat to veto the de­fence Bill and also de­manded dra­matic changes to a US$2.3 tril­lion (S$3.06 tril­lion) spend­ing pack­age that funds the fed­eral gov­ern­ment and pro­vides nearly US$900 bil­lion in coro­n­avirus aid.</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump blocks the spend­ing pack­age, large parts of the US gov­ern­ment could start to shut down next week for lack of funds at a time when of­fi­cials are dis­tribut­ing two coro­n­avirus vac­cines and work­ing to re­spond to a mas­sive hack­ing at­tack.</p>
    <p>With less than a month left in of­fice, Mr Trump is an­gry that some Repub­li­cans have ac­knowl­edged his loss to Demo­crat Joe Bi­den in the Nov 3 elec­tion. Mr Bi­den will be sworn in as pres­i­dent on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said he ve­toed the de­fence pol­icy Bill, which has passed ev­ery year since 1961, be­cause he ob­jected to li­a­bil­ity pro­tec­tions for so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies un­re­lated to na­tional se­cu­rity and did not want to re­name mil­i­tary bases that are cur­rently named for generals who fought for the pro-slav­ery Con­fed­er­acy dur­ing the Civil War.</p>
    <p>Democrats and Repub­li­cans ob­jected to Mr Trump’s veto of the Na­tional De­fence Au­tho­ri­sa­tion Act (NDAA). Demo­cratic Se­na­tor Mark Warner said in a state­ment: “I look for­ward to over­rid­ing the Pres­i­dent’s fruit­less and ridicu­lous at­tempt to un­der­mine our na­tional se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Se­nate Armed Ser­vices Com­mit­tee chair­man Jim In­hofe, a Repub­li­can, also blasted Mr Trump’s veto.</p>
    <p>“The NDAA has be­come law ev­ery year for 59 years straight be­cause it’s ab­so­lutely vi­tal to our na­tional se­cu­rity and our troops,”</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor In­hofe said. “This year must not be an ex­cep­tion.”</p>
    <p>The NDAA de­ter­mines ev­ery­thing from how many ships are bought to sol­diers’ pay to how to ad­dress geopo­lit­i­cal threats.</p>
    <p>US Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wed­nes­day the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives would re­turn on Dec 28 to vote on whether to over­ride Mr Trump’s veto. That is the same day gov­ern­ment fund­ing is due to ex­pire. A Se­nate vote is ex­pected shortly there­after.</p>
    <p>In a video posted to so­cial me­dia on Tues­day evening, Mr Trump sur­prised some of his clos­est of­fi­cials by de­mand­ing that law­mak­ers change the coro­n­avirus aid part of the spend­ing Bill to in­clude a US$2,000 pay­ment to each Amer­i­can, more than triple the US$600 pro­vided in the pack­age.</p>
    <p>A source fa­mil­iar with the sit­u­a­tion said aides thought they had talked Mr Trump out of the US$2,000 de­mand last week. The video sur­prised even Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin, who took part in the talks and backed the US$600 fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of Con­gress had been dis­cussing the US$600 fig­ure for al­most a week be­fore vot­ing to ap­prove it late on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump did not ex­plic­itly say he would veto the spend­ing Bill, ap­par­ently hold­ing out hope Con­gress would mod­ify a pack­age that took months to ne­go­ti­ate. The White House had said on Sun­day Mr Trump would sign it into law.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump has 10 days, not count­ing Sun­days, to veto the spend­ing Bill once he re­ceives it from Con­gress, which is still pro­cess­ing the mas­sive leg­is­la­tion. If he ve­toes it, Con­gress can promptly vote to over­ride him.</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump takes no ac­tion within 10 days of re­ceipt, ex­clud­ing Sun­days, it would au­to­mat­i­cally be­come law un­less Con­gress is ad­journed. If no ac­tion oc­curs by Jan 3 when the new Con­gress is sworn in, the Bill would die.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump sparked a record 35-day shut­down two years ago when he re­jected a fed­eral spend­ing Bill over what he said was in­suf­fi­cient fund­ing for build­ing a USMex­ico border wall.</p>
    <p>VI­TAL TO SE­CU­RITY</p>
    <p>The NDAA has be­come law ev­ery year for 59 years straight be­cause it’s ab­so­lutely vi­tal to our na­tional se­cu­rity and our troops.</p>
    <p>This year must not be an ex­cep­tion.</p>
