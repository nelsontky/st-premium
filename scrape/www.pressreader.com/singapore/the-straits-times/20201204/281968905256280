    <p>•</p>
    <p>KY­OTO Ms Naomi Hasegawa’s fam­ily sells toasted mochi out of a small, cedar-tim­bered shop next to a ram­bling old shrine in Ky­oto. The fam­ily started the busi­ness to pro­vide re­fresh­ments to weary trav­ellers com­ing from across Ja­pan to pray for pan­demic re­lief – in the year 1000.</p>
    <p>Now, more than a mil­len­nium later, a new dis­ease has dev­as­tated the econ­omy in the an­cient cap­i­tal, as its once re­li­able stream of tourists has evap­o­rated. But Ms Hasegawa is not con­cerned about her en­ter­prise’s fi­nances. Like many busi­nesses in Ja­pan, her fam­ily’s shop, Ichiwa, takes the long view – al­beit longer than most.</p>
    <p>By putting tra­di­tion and sta­bil­ity over profit and growth, Ichiwa has weath­ered wars, plagues, nat­u­ral disas­ters, and the rise and fall of em­pires. Through it all, its rice flour cakes have re­mained the same.</p>
    <p>Such en­ter­prises may be less dy­namic than those in other coun­tries. But their re­silience of­fers lessons for busi­nesses in places like the United States, where the coro­n­avirus has forced tens of thou­sands into bank­ruptcy.</p>
    <p>“If you look at the eco­nom­ics text­books, en­ter­prises are sup­posed to be max­imis­ing prof­its, scal­ing up their size, mar­ket share and growth rate. But th­ese com­pa­nies’ op­er­at­ing prin­ci­ples are com­pletely dif­fer­ent,” said Ky­oto’s Ryukoku Univer­sity pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus of busi­ness Kenji Mat­suoka. “Their No. 1 pri­or­ity is car­ry­ing on,” he added. “Each gen­er­a­tion is like a run­ner in a re­lay race. What’s im­por­tant is pass­ing the ba­ton.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is an old-busi­ness su­per­power. The coun­try is home to more than 33,000 with at least 100 years of his­tory – more than 40 per cent of the world’s to­tal.</p>
    <p>More than 3,100 have been run­ning for at least two cen­turies. Around 140 have ex­isted for more than 500 years. And at least 19 claim to have been con­tin­u­ously op­er­at­ing since the first mil­len­nium. (Some of the old­est com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Ichiwa, can­not defini­tively trace their his­tory back to their found­ing, but their time­lines are ac­cepted by the gov­ern­ment, schol­ars and – in Ichiwa’s case – the com­pet­ing mochi shop across the street.)</p>
    <p>The busi­nesses, known as shinise, are a source of both pride and fas­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­gional gov­ern­ments pro­mote their prod­ucts. Busi­ness man­age­ment books ex­plain the se­crets of their suc­cess. And en­tire travel guides are de­voted to them. Most of th­ese old busi­nesses are, like Ichiwa, small, fam­ily-run en­ter­prises that deal in tra­di­tional goods and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>But some are among Ja­pan’s most fa­mous com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Nin­tendo, which got its start mak­ing play­ing cards 131 years ago, and the soya sauce brand Kikko­man, which has been around since 1917.</p>
    <p>To sur­vive for a mil­len­nium, Ms Hasegawa said, a busi­ness can­not just chase prof­its. It has to have a higher pur­pose. In the case of Ichiwa, that was a reli­gious call­ing: Serv­ing the shrine’s pil­grims.</p>
    <p>Those kinds of core val­ues, known as kakun or fam­ily pre­cepts, have guided many com­pa­nies’ busi­ness de­ci­sions through the gen­er­a­tions. They look af­ter their em­ploy­ees, sup­port the com­mu­nity and strive to make a prod­uct that in­spires pride.</p>
    <p>For Ichiwa, that means do­ing one thing and do­ing it well – a very Ja­panese ap­proach to busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has de­clined many op­por­tu­ni­ties to ex­pand, in­clud­ing, most re­cently, a re­quest from Uber Eats to start on­line de­liv­ery. Mochi re­mains the only item on the menu, and if you want some­thing to drink, you are po­litely of­fered the choice of roasted green tea.</p>
    <p>For most of Ichiwa’s his­tory, the women of the Hasegawa fam­ily made the sweet snack in more or less the same way. They boiled the rice in the wa­ter from a small spring that bur­bles into the shop’s cel­lar, pounded it into a paste and then shaped it into balls that they gen­tly toasted on wooden skew­ers over a small cast iron hi­bachi. The rice’s caramelise­d skin is brushed with sweet miso paste and served to the shrine’s vis­i­tors hot, be­fore the del­i­cate treat cools and turns tough and chewy.</p>
    <p>Ichiwa has made a few con­ces­sions to moder­nity. The lo­cal health depart­ment has for­bid­den the use of well wa­ter. A mochi ma­chine hid­den in the kitchen me­chan­i­cally pounds the rice, sav­ing a few hours of work each morn­ing. And, af­ter cen­turies of op­er­at­ing on the hon­our sys­tem, it charges a fixed price per plate, a change it in­sti­tuted some time af­ter World War II as the busi­ness be­gan to pay more at­ten­tion to its fi­nances.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese com­pa­nies that</p>
    <p>have en­dured the long­est have of­ten been de­fined by an aver­sion to risk – shaped in part by past crises – and an ac­cu­mu­la­tion of large cash re­serves. It is a com­mon trait among Ja­panese en­ter­prises and part of the rea­son that the coun­try has so far avoided the high bank­ruptcy rates of the US dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Even when they “make some prof­its”, said Gold­man Sachs an­a­lyst To­mo­hiro Ota, “they do not in­crease their cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture”.</p>
    <p>Large en­ter­prises in par­tic­u­lar keep sub­stan­tial re­serves to en­sure that they can con­tinue is­su­ing pay cheques and meet their other fi­nan­cial obli­ga­tions in the event of an eco­nomic down­turn or a cri­sis. But even smaller</p>
    <p>busi­nesses tend to have low debt lev­els and an av­er­age of one to two months of op­er­at­ing ex­penses on hand, Dr Ota said.</p>
    <p>When they do need sup­port, fi­nanc­ing is cheap and read­ily avail­able. In­ter­est rates in Ja­pan have been low for decades, and a gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus pack­age in­tro­duced in re­sponse to the pan­demic has ef­fec­tively ze­roed them out for most small en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>Small shinise of­ten own their own fa­cil­i­ties and rely on mem­bers of the fam­ily to help keep pay­roll costs down, al­low­ing them to stock­pile cash.</p>
    <p>When Ja­pan Univer­sity of Eco­nom­ics Grad­u­ate School pro­fes­sor Toshio Goto, who has writ­ten sev­eral books on the</p>
    <p>en­ter­prises, con­ducted a sur­vey this sum­mer of com­pa­nies that are at least 100 years old, more than a quar­ter said they had enough funds on hand to op­er­ate for two years or longer.</p>
    <p>Still, that does not mean they are frozen in time. Many started dur­ing the 200-year pe­riod, be­gin­ning in the 17th cen­tury, when Ja­pan largely sealed it­self off from the out­side world, pro­vid­ing a sta­ble busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>But over the last cen­tury, sur­vival has in­creas­ingly meant find­ing a bal­ance be­tween pre­serv­ing tra­di­tions and adapt­ing to quickly chang­ing mar­ket con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>For some com­pa­nies, that has meant up­dat­ing their core busi­ness. NBK, a ma­te­ri­als firm that started off mak­ing iron ket­tles in 1560, is now pro­duc­ing high-tech ma­chine parts. Hosoo, a 332-year-old ki­mono man­u­fac­turer in Ky­oto, has ex­panded its tex­tile busi­ness into home fur­nish­ings and even elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>For oth­ers, keep­ing up with the times can be hard, es­pe­cially those, like Tanaka-Iga, that are es­sen­tially sell­ing tra­di­tion it­self. Tanaka-Iga has been mak­ing Bud­dhist reli­gious goods in Ky­oto since 885. It is fa­mous for what its 72nd-gen­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Ma­saichi Tanaka jok­ingly refers to as the Mercedes-Benz of but­su­dan – house­hold shrines that can sell for hun­dreds of thou­sands of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has been tough, he said, but the big­gest chal­lenges</p>
    <p>faced by his com­pany, and many oth­ers, are Ja­pan’s age­ing so­ci­ety and chang­ing tastes. Some com­pa­nies have closed be­cause the own­ers could not find a suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>For Mr Tanaka, it is get­ting harder and harder to re­place skilled tra­di­tional work­ers. Busi­ness is crimped be­cause fewer peo­ple nowa­days go to the tem­ples he sup­plies. And new homes are rarely built with a place to put a but­su­dan, which nor­mally oc­cu­pies its own spe­cial nook in a tra­di­tional Ja­panese-style room with tatami floor­ing and slid­ing pa­per doors. When it comes to reli­gious tra­di­tion, there is lit­tle room for in­no­va­tion, Mr Tanaka said.</p>
    <p>Many of his prod­ucts’ de­signs are nearly as old as the com­pany. He has con­sid­ered in­cor­po­rat­ing 3D print­ers into his busi­ness, but he won­ders who’s go­ing to buy items made with one.</p>
    <p>Ichiwa is bliss­fully un­trou­bled by such con­cerns. The fam­ily is large, the busi­ness is small, and the only spe­cial skill needed to grill the mochi is a high tol­er­ance for blis­ter­ing heat.</p>
    <p>But Ms Hasegawa, 60, ad­mits she some­times feels the pres­sure of the shop’s his­tory. Even though the busi­ness doesn’t pro­vide much of a liv­ing, ev­ery­one in the fam­ily from a young age “was warned that as long as one of us was still alive, we needed to carry on”, she said. One rea­son “we keep go­ing”, she added, is that “we all hate the idea of be­ing the one to let it go”.</p>
