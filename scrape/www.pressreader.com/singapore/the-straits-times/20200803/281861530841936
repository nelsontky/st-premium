    <p>WASHINGTON • The head of the US Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity’s in­tel­li­gence branch has been re­moved from his po­si­tion af­ter his of­fice com­piled re­ports on pro­test­ers and j our­nal­ists cov­er­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponse to un­rest in Port­land, Oregon, last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Brian Mur­phy, the act­ing un­der­sec­re­tary for in­tel­li­gence and anal­y­sis, was re­as­signed to a new po­si­tion in the depart­ment af­ter his of­fice dis­sem­i­nated to the law en­force­ment com­mu­nity “open­source in­tel­li­gence re­ports” con­tain­ing Twit­ter posts of jour­nal­ists, not­ing they had pub­lished leaked un­clas­si­fied doc­u­ments, ac­cord­ing to an ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>It was not clear what Mr Mur­phy’s new po­si­tion would be. Mr Chad Wolf, the act­ing sec­re­tary for the Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity, made the de­ci­sion last Fri­day af­ter or­der­ing the of­fice to halt the in­tel­li­gence ex­am­i­na­tion, the ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wolf has also asked the Home­land Se­cu­rity’s Of­fice of In­spec­torGen­eral to in­ves­ti­gate any ef­forts by the in­tel­li­gence branch to col­lect in­for­ma­tion about pro­test­ers or jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>The ouster came af­ter The Washington Post re­ported that Mr Mur­phy’s of­fice com­piled re­ports that in part tar­geted The New York Times’ pub­lish­ing of an in­tel­li­gence anal­y­sis in­di­cat­ing that the Home­land Se­cu­rity Depart­ment had lit­tle un­der­stand­ing of the sit­u­a­tion in Port­land when it de­ployed teams of tac­ti­cal agents in cam­ou­flage to face crowds of pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to sum­maris­ing the tweets of a Times re­porter, the in­tel­li­gence re­ports in­cluded a tweet by Mr Ben­jamin Wittes, the ed­i­torin-chief of Law­fare, a blog about law and na­tional se­cu­rity, who had shared an in­ter­nal memo that warned Home­land Se­cu­rity of­fi­cers not to leak to the press.</p>
    <p>The re­ports also in­cluded a tweet from Mr Wittes show­ing an e-mail from Mr Mur­phy telling the in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers to re­fer to in­di­vid­u­als at­tack­ing the fed­eral court­house in Port­land as “VI­O­LENT AN­TIFA AN­AR­CHISTS”.</p>
    <p>Mr Mur­phy’s con­clu­sion about the mo­ti­va­tions of the in­di­vid­u­als in Port­land came just days af­ter in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers is­sued the memo re­ported by The Times that said the agency had “low con­fi­dence” that the at­tacks against the fed­eral court­house re­flected a broader threat.</p>
    <p>The is­sue prompted the Se­nate In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee to send a let­ter to Mr Mur­phy ques­tion­ing the in­tel­li­gence-gath­er­ing ef­fort of jour­nal­ists and pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Adam Schiff, the chair­man of the House In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee, said in a state­ment last Satur­day that his com­mit­tee had been “con­duct­ing rig­or­ous over­sight” of the Of­fice of In­tel­li­gence and Anal­y­sis, in­clud­ing ac­tions by Mr Mur­phy prior to his abrupt and ap­par­ent re­as­sign­ment.</p>
    <p>The Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity has al­ready faced wide­spread back­lash for the ag­gres­sive be­hav­iour of the tac­ti­cal teams in Port­land, as well as in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the in­spec­tors-gen­eral for the Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity and the Depart­ment of Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Mr Mur­phy, for­merly with the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI), led an of­fice with the Home­land Se­cu­rity Depart­ment charged with shar­ing in­for­ma­tion about po­ten­tial na­tional se­cu­rity threats with fed­eral, state and lo­cal law en­force­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Such a co­or­di­nat­ing ef­fort was one of the mo­ti­va­tions in cre­at­ing the depart­ment af­ter the Sept 11, 2001, ter­ror at­tacks. In 2015, Mr Mur­phy joined FBI head­quar­ters to work on an ef­fort known as Coun­ter­ing Vi­o­lent Ex­trem­ism, or CVE, af­ter serv­ing as an as­sis­tant spe­cial agent in charge of coun­tert­er­ror­ism in Chicago.</p>
    <p>Mr Mur­phy was known as an am­bi­tious in­ves­ti­ga­tor who was once pro­filed in a self-ag­gran­dis­ing ar­ti­cle about a ter­ror­ism case he had worked on.</p>
    <p>But some for­mer agents and Jus­tice Depart­ment of­fi­cials fa­mil­iar with Mr Mur­phy’s work at the time, who re­quested anonymity, ex­pressed con­cern about some CVE pro­pos­als, his ten­dency to ig­nore the rules and fail­ure to co­or­di­nate his ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity has al­ready faced wide­spread back­lash for the ag­gres­sive be­hav­iour of the tac­ti­cal teams in Port­land, as well as in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the in­spec­tors-gen­eral for the Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity and the Depart­ment of Jus­tice.</p>

The Home&#xAD;land Se&#xAD;cu&#xAD;rity Depart&#xAD;ment had de&#xAD;ployed teams of tac&#xAD;ti&#xAD;cal agents, some in cam&#xAD;ou&#xAD;flage, to face crowds of pro&#xAD;test&#xAD;ers.</p>
