    <p>WASH­ING­TON • For the bet­ter part of three years, United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s trade war with China strained re­la­tions be­tween the world’s largest economies.</p>
    <p>Now, the trade pact the two coun­tries signed in Jan­uary ap­pears to be the most durable part of the USChina re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween the US and China are flar­ing over the coronaviru­s, which the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ac­cuses China of fail­ing to con­trol, as well as ac­cu­sa­tions of es­pi­onage, in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft and hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials last Tues­day or­dered the clo­sure of the Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton, say­ing diplo­mats there had aided in eco­nomic es­pi­onage. That prompted China to or­der the clo­sure of the US con­sulate in Chengdu.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the week, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion added another 11 Chi­nese com­pa­nies to a govern­ment list, bar­ring them from buy­ing Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy and other prod­ucts, cit­ing hu­man rights abuses against pre­dom­i­nantly Mus­lim eth­nic mi­nori­ties in the Xin­jiang re­gion in China’s far west.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries are also clash­ing over China’s se­cu­rity crack­down in Hong Kong, its global 5G am­bi­tions and its ter­ri­to­rial claims in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>But un­like pre­vi­ous mo­ments of height­ened ten­sions be­tween the US and China, Mr Trump has not threat­ened to im­pose ad­di­tional tar­iffs on Chi­nese goods or take other steps to pun­ish com­pa­nies that ex­port their prod­ucts to Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>And nei­ther side is threat­en­ing to rip up the ini­tial trade deal they signed in Jan­uary, which took years of painful ne­go­ti­a­tions to com­plete.</p>
    <p>As ten­sions be­tween the two coun­tries rise again, both sides ap­pear to think they have more to lose from rup­tur­ing the agree­ment than they would gain.</p>
    <p>“Iron­i­cally, trade has be­come an area of co­op­er­a­tion or sta­bil­ity,” said Dr Michael Pills­bury, a China expert at the Hud­son In­sti­tute who ad­vises the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In some ways, the sign­ing of the sought-af­ter trade deal has paved the way for the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to press China on other fronts.</p>
    <p>In pur­suit of a trade deal, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had long shelved var­i­ous ac­tions to ad­dress other con­cerns about China, in­clud­ing its hu­man rights abuses in Xin­jiang, its crack­down in Hong Kong and se­cu­rity threats and sanc­tions vi­o­la­tions from Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pa­nies like Huawei and ZTE.</p>
