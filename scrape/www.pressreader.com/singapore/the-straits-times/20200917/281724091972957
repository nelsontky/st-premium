    <p>The world is at a cross­roads be­tween dig­i­tal i nte­gra­tion and frag­men­ta­tion, and the choice made will de­ter­mine the fate of the en­su­ing global econ­omy, said Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sions, he added, should be guided by eco­nomics and tech­nol­ogy, rather than pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a vir­tual di­a­logue or­gan­ised by the Peter­son In­sti­tute for In­ter­na­tional Eco­nomics (PIIE), he also said the United States has a “his­tor­i­cal op­por­tu­nity to play a lead­ing role in build­ing this global dig­i­tal ar­chi­tec­ture, gover­nance frame­work and the rules of the game”.</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue was mod­er­ated by PIIE non-res­i­dent se­nior fel­low An­abel Gon­za­lez and also in­volved Google’s for­mer head of global pol­icy Caro­line Atkin­son, who is a PIIE board mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said the Covid-19 pan­demic has un­der­lined the im­por­tance of dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity and has­tened the rise of the dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion has trans­formed the way we do busi­ness and trans­formed the way we trade. There will be con­se­quences for global trade and how the global sys­tem will con­tinue, or not con­tinue, to up­lift mil­lions from poverty in the com­ing decades,” he added.</p>
    <p>He set out sev­eral chal­lenges amid the trans­for­ma­tion. They in­clude coun­tries putting up bar­ri­ers to dig­i­tal trade and cross-bor­der data flows, like Cus­toms du­ties, out of fear or due to a de­sire for a greater share of the po­ten­tial fis­cal rev­enues; and some strug­gle to get their work­force to learn new skills, even as they deal with lo­cal firms be­ing dis­placed by com­pe­ti­tion from large for­eign en­trants.</p>
    <p>“Our de­ci­sions should be guided by eco­nomics and tech­nol­ogy, and hope­fully not by pol­i­tics,” said Mr Chan, adding that the dig­i­tal econ­omy has the po­ten­tial for in­creas­ing re­turns to scale to ben­e­fit ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>He said the US has a “his­tor­i­cal op­por­tu­nity” to lead the world on this dig­i­tal front.</p>
    <p>“It would be fair to say that if phys­i­cal trade had ce­mented the US’ global pre-em­i­nence in the last cen­tury, dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity will de­ter­mine the US’ lead­er­ship in the cur­rent cen­tury,” he added.</p>
    <p>The growth of the dig­i­tal econ­omy will be speeded up by the next wave of de­vel­op­ments, such as the adop­tion of 5G, robotics, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and other new tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the US will re­quire like-minded part­ners to help shape this new ter­rain and es­tab­lish the new rules for this new era.</p>
    <p>“If the US does this well, it will en­trench US global lead­er­ship for an­other gen­er­a­tion. The US has a head start and it will be a pity if the US is not able to ex­er­cise the power of its ex­am­ple to bring about a more in­te­grated, con­nected, se­cured and in­clu­sive dig­i­tal world.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan also said that large tech com­pa­nies, whose power and in­flu­ence can­not be un­der­stated, have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to help es­tab­lish the new dig­i­tal space.</p>
    <p>One im­por­tant way to seize the po­ten­tial of dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity is through mak­ing clear and trans­par­ent rules that re­duce un­cer­tain­ties around data pri­vacy and cy­ber se­cu­rity, and pro­mote a fair play­ing field, said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>This will also cre­ate greater har­mon­i­sa­tion among dig­i­tal mar­kets in the long run, he added.</p>
    <p>“It’s up to gov­ern­ment, in close con­sul­ta­tion with stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing the dig­i­tal giants, to de­fine the rules of the game.”</p>
    <p>He com­mended the US’ ef­forts like the US-Ja­pan Dig­i­tal Trade Agree­ment, and said Sin­ga­pore has adopted a sim­i­lar ap­proach, cit­ing the Sin­ga­pore-Aus­tralia Dig­i­tal Econ­omy Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>“Mov­ing for­ward, we look for­ward to con­tin­u­ing co­op­er­a­tion with the US to ad­vance our shared agenda in deep­en­ing global dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity and writ­ing new rules for the dig­i­tal econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Ms Atkin­son, a for­mer deputy na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser for in­ter­na­tional eco­nomics to for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama, said the pri­vate sec­tor should be in­volved in for­mu­lat­ing rules for the dig­i­tal space. Shar­ing her ex­pe­ri­ence at Google, she said one prob­lem is when en­gi­neers do not un­der­stand the goals of pol­i­cy­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>“What cre­ates a mess is when the pol­i­cy­mak­ers try to come up with the engi­neer­ing fix. Often, they may not know quite how the tech­nol­ogy works, or even some ba­sic things about the tech­nol­ogy,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan added that Sin­ga­pore wel­comes a di­verse num­ber of dig­i­tal firms to its shores, to avoid be­ing held ran­som by one dom­i­nant gi­ant.</p>
    <p>“That is our great­est as­sur­ance against any reg­u­la­tory cap­ture or any un­to­ward thing hap­pen­ing to us, be­cause we have choices, and from the choices we are able to level our knowl­edge and know what we can do and can­not do.”</p>
