    <p>Nearly three-quar­ters of Malaysia’s Bu­mi­put­era – com­pris­ing Malays and abo­rig­i­nal com­mu­ni­ties – live in an ur­ba­nia of sky­scrapers, labyrinthi­ne road net­works and high-speed In­ter­net. And just like ur­ban­ites from the coun­try’s mi­nor­ity Chi­nese and In­dian groups, they earn sig­nif­i­cantly more than those who live in ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Yet the trope of the Malay-Mus­lim majority lan­guish­ing eco­nom­i­cally in the vil­lages while the Chi­nese en­rich them­selves in the cities con­tin­ues to hold sway in Malaysian pol­i­tics, where win­ning the Malay vote is the most cru­cial plank to power.</p>
    <p>It was most re­cently trot­ted out by for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, who in an in­ter­view with Sin­ga­pore-based Asia Times claimed that Chi­nese Malaysians “own prac­ti­cally all the towns”.</p>
    <p>“We have a prob­lem with Malaysian Chi­nese,” he said last month. “We find that in Malaysia, the dis­par­ity be­tween town and coun­try is am­pli­fied by the dis­par­ity be­tween the Chi­nese in the towns and the Malays in the ru­ral ar­eas. We need to cor­rect that.”</p>
    <p>It is true that there is an in­come gap be­tween the me­dian Bu­mi­put­era fam­ily that earns RM5,420 (S$1,768) monthly and a Chi­nese one which brings in RM7,391, ac­cord­ing to newly re­leased data from a 2019 na­tional sur­vey.</p>
    <p>But there is a wider dis­par­ity be­tween ur­ban Bu­mi­put­eras, who earn RM6,209 a month, and their ru­ral cousins who earn RM3,768 a month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the ur­ban Bu­mi­put­era has a higher in­come than the me­dian ru­ral Chi­nese (RM4,610), in­di­cat­ing that ur­ban-ru­ral in­come dis­par­ity ap­plies re­gard­less of race.</p>
    <p>Pre­dictably, Tun Dr Ma­hathir’s state­ment drew crit­i­cism from groups that rep­re­sent the coun­try’s Chi­nese com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“I am not sure if Dr Ma­hathir is pre­tend­ing not to know (that not all Chi­nese are rich), or whether he is merely play­ing the racial card,” said Malaysian Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Wee Ka Siong two days later.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Lim Guan Eng, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Chi­nese-dom­i­nated Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), an ally of Dr Ma­hathir, re­sponded on Face­book that “Malaysia is not colour-coded, we are all Malaysians who live to­gether in the towns, cities and vil­lages”.</p>
    <p>“Skin colour does not guar­an­tee that you are rich or poor. This is wrong. The Chi­nese com­mu­nity is up­set at this sim­plis­tic la­belling as be­ing rich when there are many Chi­nese who are not,” he said. The post did not men­tion Dr Ma­hathir by name.</p>
    <p>Statis­tics show that most Bu­mi­put­era, who form 65 per cent of all house­holds, live in towns and cities, and make up three in ev­ery five ur­ban house­holds. They also form the majority of Malaysia’s top 20 per cent high­est earn­ers – house­holds with a monthly in­come of RM11,000 and above.</p>
    <p>There is also in­come dis­par­ity within the Bu­mi­put­era group­ing. Ac­cord­ing to Khaz­anah Re­search In­sti­tute, while the over­all poverty rate for Bu­mi­put­era was 0.8 per cent in 2014, it was much higher for the Orang Asli, or abo­rig­i­nals, in Penin­su­lar Malaysia at 34 per cent, as well as the Bu­mi­put­era of Sabah (20.2 per cent) and Sarawak (7.3 per cent).</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s agen­cies have since ceased hand­ing out sep­a­rate data for Malays and the much poorer na­tive tribes, many of whom still live with­out ac­cess to piped wa­ter and elec­tric­ity. Us­ing Bu­mi­put­era-only statis­tics cre­ates the per­cep­tion that Malays are worse off than they re­ally are.</p>
    <p>Still, the Chi­nese make up 39 per cent of the coun­try’s high­est earn­ers, de­spite form­ing only a quar­ter of all house­holds. And Bu­mi­put­era make up more than seven-tenths of the na­tion’s poor­est 30 per cent of house­holds earn­ing un­der RM4,000 monthly.</p>
    <p>So politi­cians con­tinue to point to the Chi­nese as the rea­son for the Malay com­mu­nity’s predica­ment, de­spite half a cen­tury of state-sanc­tioned af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion to up­lift the majority eth­nic group.</p>
    <p>DAP as­sis­tant po­lit­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion di­rec­tor Ong Kian Ming has cau­tioned that “be­liev­ing these myths would lead one to ig­nore the sig­nif­i­cant progress made in the cre­ation of a vi­brant Bu­mi­put­era mid­dle class in Malaysia over the past decades”.</p>
    <p>“We need to un­der­stand these facts in or­der to know what poli­cies have suc­ceeded and what poli­cies have failed in the past,” the for­mer deputy in­ter­na­tional trade and in­dus­try min­is­ter said. “For ex­am­ple, would more mid­dle- and high-in­come house­holds in the Bu­mi­put­era com­mu­nity have been cre­ated if there was less crony cap­i­tal­ism and more trans­parency in the cre­ation of ca­pa­ble Bu­mi­put­era en­trepreneur­s and pro­fes­sion­als?”</p>
    <p>That Dr Ma­hathir has re­sorted to this hack­neyed blame game is not sur­pris­ing, as he seeks to win back sup­port to top­ple the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment. But he is merely one of many.</p>
    <p>Racial rhetoric has height­ened since the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional lost its two-thirds su­per­ma­jor­ity in 2008, with the nar­ra­tive ex­pand­ing to how the Chi­nese are not sat­is­fied with just be­ing wealthy, but were also try­ing to dis­man­tle Malay po­lit­i­cal dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>For the Malay right-wing, Umno’s de­feat in the 2018 elec­tion was proof that their rights were be­ing threat­ened. Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia – Malaysia’s two largest Malay par­ties which are now in the rul­ing PN – forged an al­liance last year to fight against the claimed ero­sion of Malay and Is­lamic rights and privileges.</p>
    <p>As the Fed­er­a­tion of Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tions Malaysia pres­i­dent Goh Tian Chuan said in re­sponse to Dr Ma­hathir’s com­ments last month: “It is deeply re­gret­ful that all these years, the com­mu­nity had to en­dure such un­fair and dis­crim­i­na­tory re­marks... hurled at them by un­scrupu­lous politi­cians look­ing for po­lit­i­cal mileage at the ex­pense of racial unity and har­mony.”</p>
