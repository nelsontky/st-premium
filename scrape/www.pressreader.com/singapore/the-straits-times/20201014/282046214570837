    <p>The lo­cal author­i­ties are still in con­tact with their coun­ter­parts in the United States re­gard­ing the Dick­son Yeo es­pi­onage case, the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) told The Straits Times over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Al­though the MHA de­clined to pro­vide fur­ther in­for­ma­tion, ob­servers say that the author­i­ties here are not likely to take fur­ther le­gal ac­tion against Yeo, a Sin­ga­porean who was jailed for spy­ing on the US for China, as his ac­tions did not con­sti­tute a di­rect threat to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Yeo, 39, was sentenced to 14 months’ jail last Fri­day af­ter ear­lier plead­ing guilty to act­ing as an il­le­gal for­eign agent in the US.</p>
    <p>He had con­fessed to be­ing re­cruited by Chi­nese agents when he was vis­it­ing Bei­jing as a PhD stu­dent at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>He re­cruited in­di­vid­u­als in the Amer­i­can mil­i­tary and gov­ern­ment to write re­ports, which he then passed on to his Chi­nese han­dlers.</p>
    <p>He also cre­ated a fake con­sult­ing com­pany to en­tice Amer­i­can ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said that Yeo could be fur­ther ques­tioned when he re­turns to Sin­ga­pore, and that he is likely to be placed un­der close ob­ser­va­tion by se­cu­rity agen­cies here.</p>
    <p>Yeo has served 11 months of his 14-month sen­tence as he has been held in a Washington jail since his ar­rest last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (RSIS) re­search fel­low Muham­mad Faizal Ab­dul Rah­man said that se­cu­rity agen­cies in Sin­ga­pore are likely to keep tabs on Yeo to en­sure that he rein­te­grates into so­ci­ety and is “less amenable to covert for­eign in­flu­ence”.</p>
    <p>Mr Faizal added that Yeo’s ac­tions may have fallen into a “grey area” here, as he was not act­ing di­rectly against Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>“Rather, he was work­ing for one for­eign power against another for­eign power. None­the­less, his ac­tions could fuel mis­con­cep­tions over­seas that Sin­ga­pore is a ‘third China’ and that the coun­try’s Chi­nese ma­jor­ity is sus­cep­ti­ble to China’s in­flu­ence,” said Mr Faizal, who spe­cialises in home­land se­cu­rity, in­tel­li­gence and counter-ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>Mr Faizal said that Yeo’s ad­mis­sion to the court in the US that “he is still sym­pa­thetic to the Chi­nese cause sug­gests that he re­mains ide­o­log­i­cally amenable to covert for­eign in­flu­ence, al­though his value as an in­tel­li­gence as­set is di­min­ished”.</p>
    <p>Lawyers noted that Yeo can­not be tried here on the same es­pi­onage charges as he has al­ready been con­victed and pun­ished in the US.</p>
    <p>To be pe­nalised here, Yeo must have acted against Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­ests or se­cu­rity, said lawyer Amo­lat Singh.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this is not likely to have been the case, said lawyer Eu­gene Thu­raisingam, cit­ing the MHA’s state­ment in July which stated that in­ves­ti­ga­tions on Yeo have not re­vealed any di­rect threat to Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, should that as­sess­ment change, Yeo may be li­able for the of­fences un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act,” said Mr Thu­raisingam, adding that Yeo might even have his ci­ti­zen­ship stripped if he were a cit­i­zen by reg­is­tra­tion or nat­u­ral­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, academics say Yeo’s case is a cau­tion­ary tale for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Ben­jamin Ho, who is with the China Pro­gramme at the RSIS, said there are ex­ist­ing eth­i­cal guide­lines that academics have to abide by that could pre­vent such in­ci­dents from oc­cur­ring.</p>
    <p>But the onus is largely on the academics to fol­low these guide­lines, he said.</p>
    <p>It is “fair game” for in­tel­li­gence or­gan­i­sa­tions to use what­ever sources they can get their hands on to ob­tain in­for­ma­tion, said Prof Ho.</p>
    <p>“It’s up to the academics to be care­ful, to have a cer­tain sys­tem of ac­count­abil­ity so we don’t end up be­ing the col­lat­eral in this kind of geopo­lit­i­cal mat­ters.”</p>
