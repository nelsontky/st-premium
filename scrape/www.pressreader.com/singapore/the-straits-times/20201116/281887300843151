    <p>Since the 2019 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, In­done­sian pol­i­tics has been po­larised be­tween gov­ern­ing na­tion­al­ists and op­po­si­tion Is­lamists. Na­tion­al­ists in­creas­ingly see the Is­lamists as an ex­is­ten­tial threat, con­flat­ing main­stream ac­tors such as PKS with vi­o­lent ex­trem­ists. A dif­fi­culty in dis­tin­guish­ing the dif­fer­ent Is­lamist net­works is just one trap ly­ing in wait for out­side ob­servers.</p>
    <p>The re­turn of rad­i­cal cleric Habib Rizieq Shi­hab to In­done­sia last Tues­day after three years of self-ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia has re-en­er­gised his Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front (FPI) or­gan­i­sa­tion and posed a re­newed chal­lenge to Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s rul­ing In­done­sian Demo­cratic Party of Strug­gle.</p>
    <p>The charis­matic preacher was a lead­ing force be­hind the mass Is­lamist mo­bil­i­sa­tions of 2016 and 2017 – the largest street protests in In­done­sian his­tory – which led to the fall of the eth­nic Chi­nese Chris­tian gov­er­nor of Jakarta, Mr Ba­suki Tja­haja Pur­nama, pop­u­larly known as Ahok.</p>
    <p>The rea­son for his re­turn is un­clear. In­done­sia’s Am­bas­sador to Sau­dia Ara­bia Agus Maf­tuh Abege­briel ear­lier said that Rizieq was listed in a Saudi im­mi­gra­tion data­base for de­por­ta­tion, a claim the cleric has strongly de­nied.</p>
    <p>In May 2017, Rizieq was charged un­der In­done­sia’s Anti-Pornog­ra­phy Act, a law he had cham­pi­oned the pass­ing of in 2006, after a phone hack re­vealed sex­u­ally ex­plicit chat mes­sages with a woman. Be­fore he could be in­ter­viewed by po­lice, he fled to Saudi Ara­bia un­der the guise of per­form­ing the mi­nor haj. Po­lice later dropped the charge.</p>
    <p>With a na­tion­wide or­gan­i­sa­tional struc­ture and a highly mo­ti­vated mem­ber­ship claimed to num­ber in the mil­lions, Rizieq is ar­guably In­done­sia’s de facto op­po­si­tion leader. Through the power of the In­ter­net, he had con­tin­ued to play a key po­lit­i­cal role from ex­ile, ap­pear­ing via video at the cen­tre­piece rally for pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Prabowo Su­bianto last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Prabowo cam­paigned on a prom­ise that as soon as he was elected, he would bring Rizieq back from Saudi Ara­bia on his own plane.</p>
    <p>Im­pres­sive crowds, many dressed in the white para­mil­i­tary-style uni­form of FPI cadre, greeted Rizieq’s ar­rival at Soekarno-Hatta air­port and lined the streets on his jour­ney back to his home in cen­tral Jakarta.</p>
    <p>But he re­turns to a very dif­fer­ent In­done­sia from the one he left. The Jokowi gov­ern­ment in its sec­ond term has cracked down on Mus­lim hard­lin­ers un­der a broad de­rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing learnt a les­son on the po­ten­tial of Is­lamist mo­bil­i­sa­tion and un­en­cum­bered by the need to seek re-elec­tion, the Pres­i­dent has sought to marginalis­e them in state in­sti­tu­tions and place tighter con­trols on re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties. The gov­ern­ment has in­tro­duced pro­grammes to man­age preach­ers and es­tab­lished a Web por­tal for pub­lic ser­vants to sub­mit tip-offs about rad­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>ECO­NOMIC IS­SUES</p>
    <p>But with In­done­sia en­ter­ing its first re­ces­sion since 1998 due to the coro­n­avirus pandemic, Rizieq is well placed to con­vert his brand of re­li­gious pop­ulism into po­lit­i­cal power in the lead-up to the 2024 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Blas­phemy was the cause that gal­vanised the move­ment in 2016 and sent Ahok to jail. Since then, eco­nomic is­sues have be­come more prom­i­nent, with a fo­cus on cor­rup­tion and an un­der­cur­rent of re­sent­ment to­wards Chi­nese mi­grant work­ers and eth­nic Chi­nese business lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The Jokowi gov­ern­ment has re­sponded calmly, if not dis­mis­sively, to Rizieq’s re­turn.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous week­end, Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Po­lit­i­cal, Le­gal and Se­cu­rity Af­fairs Mah­fud MD ob­served that Rizieq was not in the same class as Ay­a­tol­lah Khome­ini, whose re­turn from Paris to Iran in 1979 was met by mil­lions. “Rizieq Shi­hab is no Khome­ini,” Mr Mah­fud said. “When Khome­ini re­turned from Paris, the en­tire pop­u­la­tion greeted him be­cause he was a holy man.”</p>
    <p>But Rizieq’s for­mer lawyer Kapi­tra Am­pera has warned the gov­ern­ment not to un­der­es­ti­mate the cleric’s sup­port. One key to Rizieq’s suc­cess will be his abil­ity to form an op­po­si­tion al­liance that bridges sec­tar­ian di­vides.</p>
    <p>Such a coali­tion might find a pow­er­ful plat­form cen­tring on anti-cor­rup­tion and “re­li­gious free­dom”, wrapped in a pop­ulist pack­age that chan­nels grow­ing anx­i­ety over the rise of China.</p>
    <p>A se­ries of events since last year, from ten­sions in the South China Sea to un­rest over the num­ber of Chi­nese blue-col­lar work­ers on Belt and Road-style projects, have led to el­e­vated lev­els of anti-Chi­nese sen­ti­ment on In­done­sian so­cial me­dia, in­clud­ing FPI chat groups.</p>
    <p>Rizieq and his al­lies are no doubt poised to ex­ploit any ma­jor gov­ern­ment con­tro­versy be­tween now and the elec­tion that can be linked to his catchcry of “moral rev­o­lu­tion”.</p>
    <p>In his first ad­dress back at FPI head­quar­ters, Rizieq called for rec­on­cil­i­a­tion with the gov­ern­ment on the con­di­tion that sev­eral im­pris­oned preach­ers be re­leased, in­clud­ing the el­derly founder of the Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) mil­i­tant group, Abu Bakar Bashir. He also called for the re­lease of work­ers and stu­dents ar­rested last month dur­ing protests against a con­tro­ver­sial om­nibus law.</p>
    <p>VIP SUP­PORT­ERS</p>
    <p>Among his first VIP vis­i­tors was Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan.</p>
    <p>In an in­di­ca­tion of the po­lit­i­cal im­por­tance of the Rizieq re­la­tion­ship, Dr Anies, a likely pres­i­den­tial con­tender, made the house call de­spite the meet­ing be­ing in ap­par­ent vi­o­la­tion of a Health Min­istry reg­u­la­tion for trav­ellers from over­seas to iso­late at home for 14 days.</p>
    <p>Dr Anies was joined in the meet­ing by a num­ber of other of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing In­done­sian Ulema Coun­cil deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral Tengku Zulka­r­nain.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, Rizieq re­ceived the lead­ers of the Mus­lim Brother­hood-in­spired Pros­per­ous Jus­tice Party (PKS), in­clud­ing party pres­i­dent Ah­mad Syaikhu and chair of the gov­ern­ing coun­cil Salim Se­gaf Al Jufri. PKS sup­port would be crit­i­cal to any suc­cess­ful faith-based pop­ulist al­liance.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral re­ports of Rizieq’s re­turn have con­nected his or­gan­i­sa­tion to ter­ror­ist net­works in In­done­sia, such as the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and JI. The Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front, how­ever, is the­o­log­i­cally tra­di­tion­al­ist and its “business model” is that of a vig­i­lante group pro­vid­ing ser­vices in the in­for­mal po­lit­i­cal econ­omy. The group be­came in­fa­mous for con­duct­ing anti-vice “sweep­ing” op­er­a­tions against bars and ho­tels.</p>
    <p>It has an an­tag­o­nis­tic re­la­tion­ship with Salafi ji­hadi groups such as ISIS and JI. In May last year, then Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Po­lit­i­cal, Le­gal, and Se­cu­rity Af­fairs Wi­ranto touched on FPI’s murky po­lit­i­cal ori­gins when he com­plained that the Rizeq he knew had changed. “Back in 1998, I cul­ti­vated FPI in the sense of giv­ing it an op­por­tu­nity to ex­ist be­cause at the time, we were both try­ing to se­cure the na­tion,” he told Kom­pas TV.</p>
    <p>On his ar­rival in Jakarta, Rizieq claimed to have doc­u­men­ta­tion from the State In­tel­li­gence Agency of a ne­go­ti­ated set­tle­ment, po­ten­tially shed­ding light on the cir­cum­stances of his re­turn from ex­ile. “I haven’t re­vealed these doc­u­ments to the pub­lic,” he said on his YouTube chan­nel. “I think there’s no need to re­veal them ex­cept in case of an emer­gency”.</p>
    <p>MIL­I­TANT PLU­RAL­ISM</p>
    <p>Since the 2019 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, In­done­sian pol­i­tics has been po­larised be­tween gov­ern­ing na­tion­al­ists and op­po­si­tion Is­lamists. Na­tion­al­ists in­creas­ingly see the Is­lamists as an ex­is­ten­tial threat, con­flat­ing main­stream ac­tors such as PKS with vi­o­lent ex­trem­ists.</p>
    <p>A dif­fi­culty in dis­tin­guish­ing the dif­fer­ent Is­lamist net­works is just one trap ly­ing in wait for out­side ob­servers. The na­tion­al­ist agenda, some­times de­scribed as “mil­i­tant plu­ral­ism”, seeks to use the power of the state to curb Is­lamist in­tol­er­ance and pro­mote mod­er­a­tion un­der the ban­ner of “Is­lam Nu­san­tara” (Archipelag­ic Is­lam). But mil­i­tant plu­ral­ism rep­re­sents one side of a heated cul­ture war that has the po­ten­tial to pro­duce a back­lash in the fu­ture, un­der­min­ing democ­racy in the process.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s for­eign part­ners would be wise to avoid get­ting caught up in this cul­ture war. Be­ing seen to choose a side would build cer­tain risks into any re­la­tion­ship. If the ta­bles of gov­er­nance were to sud­denly turn in 2024 – think of United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s shock 2016 vic­tory by anal­ogy – for­eign coun­tries might find them­selves ex­posed in the new po­lit­i­cal cli­mate.</p>
    <p>At the same time, it is im­por­tant to keep the cur­rent mo­ment in per­spec­tive. The crowds that met Rizieq were bussed in from across Java and rep­re­sent more a vis­ual pro­pa­ganda coup than ris­ing grass­roots sup­port. Pop­u­lar ap­proval of the Pres­i­dent re­mains sta­ble and above 60 per cent, de­spite pandemic man­age­ment fail­ings.</p>
    <p>If the In­done­sian econ­omy were to un­dergo a deeper shock, Rizieq – with his base of fol­low­ers among the ur­ban poor – is well po­si­tioned to take po­lit­i­cal ad­van­tage of the fall­out. But be­yond this, his for­tunes are very much up in the air. If the Trump ex­pe­ri­ence has taught us any­thing, it is that ma­jor po­lit­i­cal re­align­ments can be hard to pre­dict.</p>
