    <p>Two broth­ers were jailed yes­ter­day for of­fences re­lated to their fam­ily’s phys­i­cal abuse of a friend with mild in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity, which left her in a near-death state.</p>
    <p>Muham­mad Iskan­dar Is­mail, 32, was jailed for two months and four weeks af­ter plead­ing guilty to one count of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to the vic­tim by slap­ping, punch­ing and trip­ping her. He also ad­mit­ted to one count of giv­ing a false state­ment to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Muham­mad Iski Is­mail, 30, was jailed for eight months, af­ter ad­mit­ting to one count each of pro­vid­ing a false state­ment to the po­lice and per­vert­ing the course of jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Their two sis­ters also ap­peared in court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Haslinda Is­mail, 34, pleaded guilty to two counts of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt and one count of twist­ing the vic­tim’s toe with pli­ers un­til it be­came frac­tured.</p>
    <p>Has­niza Is­mail, 39, ad­mit­ted to one count each of wrong­ful con­fine­ment, vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt and per­vert­ing the course of jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The women will be sen­tenced at a later date, when 14 other charges will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion for Haslinda and seven for Has­niza.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber last year, Haslinda’s hus­band Hany Aboubakr Ab­delka­rim Ab­delfat­tah, 33, was jailed for three weeks for his in­volve­ment in the abuse.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim, now 30, was the se­condary school friend of another fam­ily mem­ber, Mr Muham­mad Isafi Is­mail, and worked in a fast­food restau­rant.</p>
    <p>She got to know his fam­ily and grew close to them over time.</p>
    <p>Af­ter run­ning away from home in early 2016, she moved into their flat at Block 714 Wood­lands Drive 70, where she stayed rent-free.</p>
    <p>But she had to buy her own food and give the sib­lings’ mother, 69-year-old Has­mah Su­long, $150 a month for laun­dry.</p>
    <p>Some time between May and June 2016, Haslinda con­fronted the vic­tim for per­form­ing sex­ual acts on her hus­band. From then on, sev­eral mem­bers of the fam­ily abused the vic­tim re­peat­edly.</p>
    <p>This i ncluded us­ing pli­ers to twist her toes and splash­ing boil­ing water on her.</p>
    <p>Haslinda con­fis­cated the vic­tim’s mo­bile phone in June 2016.</p>
    <p>There­after, the vic­tim stopped work­ing at the fast-food restau­rant and was made to do house­hold chores without pay.</p>
    <p>Haslinda and Hany later moved out of the flat.</p>
    <p>On Aug 31, 2017, Haslinda took the vic­tim to her home to help with Hari Raya Haji prepa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>She then made the vic­tim stand in the kitchen and made sure that she did not use the toi­let or sleep that night.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the vic­tim soiled her­self the next day, Haslinda struck her with sev­eral items and used ca­ble ties to se­cure her hands and legs.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim was forced to con­tinue stand­ing in the kitchen in her soiled trousers un­til the fam­ily ar­rived for Hari Raya cel­e­bra­tions at around 3pm. Haslinda then uri­nated into a packet of food and forced the vic­tim to eat it.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments also state that the vic­tim ini­tially slept in the living room, but later had her arm, leg or neck se­cured with a metal chain to a baby swing bed at night.</p>
    <p>She was sub­se­quently chained to a metal plate on a wall, be­fore be­ing moved to the toi­let when her in­con­ti­nence be­came very se­vere.</p>
    <p>By late De­cem­ber 2017, she was chained half-naked to the toi­let bowl, where she sat in her own ex­cre­ment and ate off the floor.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim’s con­di­tion be­came so dire that Has­niza called an am­bu­lance on Jan 16, 2018.</p>
    <p>In a near-death state, the vic­tim was rushed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospi­tal, where she re­quired eight hours of re­sus­ci­ta­tion in the emer­gency depart­ment.</p>
    <p>She was then trans­ferred to Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal, where she was found to be suf­fer­ing from var­i­ous in­juries such as burns on her body and 10 miss­ing teeth. She was dis­charged three months later.</p>
    <p>Has­niza in­structed Iski to tell po­lice of­fi­cers that the vic­tim had turned up at their flat with her in­juries about two weeks be­fore Jan 16, 2018. She also told him to dis­sem­i­nate her in­struc­tions to other fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Iski and Iskan­dar main­tained this ac­count in their po­lice state­ments. The three fam­ily mem­bers later con­fessed that they had lied.</p>
    <p>Has­mah’s case is still pend­ing.</p>
