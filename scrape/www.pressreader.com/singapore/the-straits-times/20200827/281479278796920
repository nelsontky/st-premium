    <p>BARCELONA • Lionel Messi has in­formed Barcelona that he in­tends to leave with im­me­di­ate ef­fect, and to do so by ac­ti­vat­ing a clause in his con­tract that would mean the team where he has spent his en­tire ca­reer would not re­ceive a cent in com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old has spent the days since Barca’s 8-2 hu­mil­i­a­tion by Bay­ern Mu­nich in the Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter-fi­nals watch­ing his club de­scend into yet an­other bout of in­ter­nal tur­moil.</p>
    <p>Coach Quique Se­tien and sport­ing di­rec­tor Eric Abidal have since de­parted, with Ron­ald Koe­man leav­ing his po­si­tion as Nether­lands boss to take over at the Nou Camp.</p>
    <p>Among the Dutch­man’s first acts was to tell sev­eral se­nior play­ers – Sa­muel Umtiti, Ar­turo Vi­dal, Ivan Rakitic and Messi’s close friend, Luis Suarez – that their ser­vices were no longer re­quired.</p>
    <p>Koe­man also spoke to Messi, who at that point had stopped short of com­mit­ting his fu­ture to the club.</p>
    <p>News re­ports in Spain sug­gested that Koe­man had warned Messi that “his priv­i­leges were over” – a threat that re­port­edly made up the Ar­gentina skip­per’s mind.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of the trig­ger, the Barca cap­tain put his de­ci­sion in writ­ing on Tues­day, which was re­in­forced by his de­ci­sion to skip train­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His rep­re­sen­ta­tives be­lieve he can act uni­lat­er­ally, thanks to a clause in his con­tract that en­ables him to leave for free as long as he an­nounces his in­ten­tion to do so be­fore the end of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Barca are ex­pected to con­test the def­i­ni­tion of when the end of the sea­son is. The club prob­a­bly will ar­gue that the clause ex­pired on June 10, when the Span­ish and Euro­pean cam­paigns were sched­uled to fin­ish be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>Messi’s side is re­port­edly con­vinced that the ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances of a pan­demic-de­layed sea­son ren­dered that tim­ing ir­rel­e­vant, with the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal be­tween even­tual cham­pi­ons Bay­ern and Paris Saint-Ger­main (PSG) held only last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>As Messi de­vel­oped first into the best player of his gen­er­a­tion and then, pos­si­bly, into the best in his­tory, so were Barca trans­formed into ar­guably the most pop­u­lar team in the world.</p>
    <p>Messi has pre­vi­ously in­sisted that he wanted to fin­ish his ca­reer at the Nou Camp – de­spite sug­ges­tions that he would, even­tu­ally, re­turn for a sea­son at Newell’s Old Boys, his home­town team.</p>
    <p>But the chaos of the last few sea­sons, in which Barcelona have suf­fered a suc­ces­sion of haunt­ing de­feats in the Cham­pi­ons League and run through three man­agers in the last eight months, have ap­peared to be too much to bear.</p>
    <p>The La Liga side are en­dur­ing their first tro­phy­less sea­son in 12 years and hav­ing failed to win the Euro­pean Cup since 2015, and should Messi leave, it would sig­nal the end of their most suc­cess­ful era.</p>
    <p>Since break­ing into the first team in 2004, the mer­cu­rial for­ward has helped Barca claim 10 league ti­tles, six King’s Cups, eight Span­ish Su­per Cups, four Cham­pi­ons Leagues, three Uefa Su­per Cups and three Fifa Club World Cups.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Span­ish daily AS, the club hi­er­ar­chy are re­luc­tant for the con­tract dis­pute to go to court, but are stand­ing firm on a re­fusal to let him go for free, even though he has only one year left on his deal.</p>
    <p>Out­wardly, they re­main hope­ful of a change of heart, with new sport­ing di­rec­tor Ra­mon Planes in­sist­ing he was work­ing “to find the best so­lu­tion for Barca and for Messi”.</p>
    <p>“You have to have enor­mous re­spect for Leo be­cause of what he is and be­cause of his his­tory. We are not think­ing about any con­trac­tual clause,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Messi’s mar­riage to Barca has given both par­ties a lot, much joy to the fans and in­ter­nally, we are work­ing to con­vince Messi... We are work­ing to make a win­ning Barca.”</p>
    <p>But if he can­not be con­vinced to change his mind, the club are said to want a world-record fee of £200 mil­lion (S$360 mil­lion) – £2 mil­lion more than what PSG paid to sign Ney­mar in 2017.</p>
    <p>Cou­pled with his wages – he is the high­est-paid player in the world, earn­ing £64 mil­lion a year be­fore bonuses and add-ons – means that only a se­lect hand­ful of clubs, like Manch­ester City or PSG, can af­ford Messi.</p>
    <p>His trans­fer re­quest has since been backed by Barca play­ers, past and present. For­mer cap­tain Car­les Puyol tweeted: “Re­spect and ad­mi­ra­tion, Leo. All my sup­port, friend.”</p>
    <p>Suarez has posted two ap­plause emo­jis, while Vi­dal tweeted: “When you shut a tiger in a cage, he doesn’t give in, he fights back.”</p>
    <p>Most Barca sup­port­ers also do not ap­pear an­gered by Messi’s de­ci­sion to leave, with most in­stead di­rect­ing their fury at em­bat­tled pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral hun­dred fans gath­ered out­side the Nou Camp on Tues­day night to protest against Bar­tomeu.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard has over­seen the chaos, in­clud­ing the res­ig­na­tion of sev­eral di­rec­tors and an on­go­ing fall­out from a so­cial me­dia firm that was hired by the club, only to end up launch­ing on­line at­tacks on the play­ers.</p>
    <p>HE CAN’T BE TAMED</p>
    <p>When you shut a tiger in a cage, he doesn’t give in, he fights back. ’’</p>
