    <p>If peo­ple ig­nore rules which leads to the au­thor­i­ties shut­ting down courts, then they’re do­ing their fel­low cit­i­zens a dis­ser­vice.”</p>
    <p>RO­HIT BRI­J­NATH, urg­ing sports en­thu­si­asts to re­spect and ob­serve the Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>LONDON • Jur­gen Klopp ad­mit­ted Liver­pool cre­ated the “wrong type” of his­tory af­ter they “lost the plot” to play into As­ton Villa’s hands in their 7-2 hum­bling at Villa Park in the Premier League on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Ol­lie Watkins com­pleted a per­fect hat-trick with his head in­side 39 minutes as the Reds be­came the first reign­ing Premier League cham­pi­ons to con­cede seven goals in a top-flight match.</p>
    <p>The ab­sence of goal­keeper Alis­son Becker to in­jury, and Sa­dio Mane and Thi­ago Al­can­tara due to the coro­n­avirus was notable.</p>
    <p>Stand-in goal­keeper Adrian’s poor pass af­ter just four minutes was seized upon by Jack Gre­al­ish, who squared for Watkins to score his first Premier League goal.</p>
    <p>It was Adrian’s fifth er­ror in 21 ap­pear­ances for Liver­pool that has led di­rectly to a goal – as many as Alis­son, who is set to miss about six weeks with a shoul­der prob­lem, has in 92 games.</p>
    <p>“The first goal had an im­pact, but it shouldn’t,” added Klopp. “Adrian made a mis­take but we con­ceded goals like this in the past. We lost the plot then.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool’s high line was torn apart con­stantly by Villa’s coun­ter­at­tack, with Joe Gomez and Trent Alexan­der-Arnold both guilty of get­ting caught out play­ing the off­side trap.</p>
    <p>It was even breached from set plays as six minutes be­fore the break, Trezeguet crossed for Watkins, the Cham­pi­onship’s joint-top scorer last sea­son with 25 strikes, to be­come the first player in a decade to score a tre­ble against Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>Villa rained in 18 shots by the full-time whis­tle and could have added to goals from John McGinn, Ross Barkley and Gre­al­ish (two) as they climbed to sec­ond in the stand­ings af­ter a third suc­ces­sive win.</p>
    <p>Mo­hamed Salah grabbed a brace for the vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>“When Jur­gen Klopp says ‘Wow’ to you, you know you’ve done some­thing right,” Villa man­ager Dean Smith said. “The lads were su­perb, they ex­e­cuted the game plan per­fectly.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Liver­pool de­fender and Sky Sports pun­dit Jamie Car­ragher in­sisted the Reds have to make ad­just­ments.</p>
    <p>“The high de­fen­sive line was ripped to shreds against Leeds,” he said in ref­er­ence to Liver­pool’s 4-3 sea­son-open­ing win. “The same has hap­pened here. It has been even worse...</p>
    <p>“It is OK play­ing a high line, con­dens­ing it, mak­ing the team com­pact, win­ning the ball off the op­po­si­tion. But when they are get­ting closer to your back four and mid­field­ers are on it, I am not even say­ing run back 20 yards, I am just say­ing be ready to run back.”</p>
    <p>That Villa nar­rowly avoided rel­e­ga­tion last sea­son and fin­ished 64 points be­hind Liver­pool added to the shock fac­tor. Klopp’s men were not beaten un­til their 28th league game at Wat­ford last sea­son. But four games into the new cam­paign, they have now let in seven for the first time since 1963.</p>
    <p>“Years ago, we told our­selves we wanted to cre­ate his­tory. That was his­tory but ob­vi­ously, the wrong type,” Klopp said.</p>
    <p>“We made too many mis­takes and mas­sive ones ob­vi­ously... There is no­body to blame apart from me and us.”</p>
