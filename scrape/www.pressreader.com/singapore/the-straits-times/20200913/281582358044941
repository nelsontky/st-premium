    <p>The sheer amount of work that Mr Anil Balchan­dani put into de­fend­ing a maid left such an im­pres­sion that High Court judge Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn, in laud­ing him for his pro bono work, took spe­cial note of the num­ber of pages of his writ­ten sub­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>For the record, he turned in 279 pages af­ter a 22-day dis­trict court trial, while his sub­mis­sions for the High Court ap­peal num­bered 221 pages – ex­clud­ing at­tach­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani has gar­nered wide­spread praise for se­cur­ing the ac­quit­tal of In­done­sian Parti Liyani, yet the en­gi­neer-turned­lawyer has been quick to de­flect the plau­dits and shuns the lime­light.</p>
    <p>A state­ment on the web­site of his firm, Red Lion Cir­cle, in­stead high­lighted groups such as Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics, or Home, for do­ing the bulk of the work. The state­ment men­tioned that “coun­sel for Parti Liyani only played a very small part in her ac­quit­tal”.</p>
    <p>But those who know him say the ac­co­lades are well-de­served, point­ing to his tenac­ity, hu­mil­ity and pas­sion for his work.</p>
    <p>The Parti Liyani case was not the first time that Mr Balchan­dani has rep­re­sented a mi­grant worker un­der the Crim­i­nal Le­gal Aid Scheme and se­cured an ac­quit­tal.</p>
    <p>In 2017, af­ter a 26-day trial, he got for­mer SMRT bus driver Zhang Kun ac­quit­ted of caus­ing the death of a pas­sen­ger and in­jur­ing an­other by a rash act for an ac­ci­dent in 2013.</p>
    <p>His list­ing on on­line por­tal Sin­ga­pore Le­gal Ad­vice stated that the trial was “no­table for its length, and com­plex­ity which in­volved me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing, law of physics, me­chan­ics, and ex­per­tise in the area of engine runoff”.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani re­ceived his elec­tri­cal and com­puter en­gi­neer­ing de­gree from Carnegie Mel­lon Univer­sity in 1994 and worked as a pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer in the United States for about eight years. He then re­ceived his diploma in in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty law from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and his Juris Doc­tor de­gree from the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity in 2012.</p>
    <p>He was called to the Bar in May 2013 and prac­tised at sev­eral small and medium-sized firms be­fore ven­tur­ing out on his own as a sole pro­pri­etor in Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani is also a vol­un­teer un­der the Crim­i­nal Le­gal Aid Scheme (Clas), which is run by the Law So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>It was through Clas that Mr Balchan­dani came to rep­re­sent Ms Parti, said se­nior lawyer Suresh Damodara, a mem­ber of the steer­ing com­mit­tee that over­sees the work­ings of the scheme.</p>
    <p>Mr Damodara was among sev­eral lawyers that Mr Balchan­dani – in an in­ter­view with Home con­ducted be­fore the ac­quit­tal – thanked for giv­ing him ad­vice on the case.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­view, Mr Balchan­dani talked about how the trial was “very dif­fi­cult and long-drawn” be­cause 144 items were al­legedly stolen and he was go­ing up against “a very tena­cious set of prose­cu­tors”.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani also had a po­lice re­port filed against him for ha­rass­ment, af­ter he and his team tried to get in touch with peo­ple who were not of­fi­cially listed as wit­nesses for the trial. “It took a whole year of that hang­ing over our heads be­fore the po­lice de­cided that there was no of­fence,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Damodara said Mr Balchan­dani, who de­clined re­quests to be in­ter­viewed by The Sun­day Times, was a com­mit­ted and com­pe­tent de­fence coun­sel who made a dif­fer­ence in the case.</p>
    <p>He added: “Hope­fully the ex­am­ple set by Anil and other Clas lawyers will in­spire more lawyers to do pro bono crim­i­nal le­gal work.”</p>
