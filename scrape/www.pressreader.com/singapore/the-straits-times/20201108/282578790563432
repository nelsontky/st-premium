    <p>The mar­ket­ing ma­te­ri­als of a prop­erty ed­u­ca­tion com­pany claim that it can help its stu­dents buy prop­er­ties with lit­tle or no cash down pay­ment.</p>
    <p>To prove that its “se­cret” for­mula – taught only to those in paid cour­ses – works, it shows pho­to­graphs of past par­tic­i­pants who had ap­par­ent suc­cess, such as buy­ing two prop­er­ties in 18 days.</p>
    <p>As such claims seem too good to be true, some ne­ti­zens have ques­tioned whether this course is a scam.</p>
    <p>The firm re­sponded to one such post with: “(Our com­pany) is not on the MAS alert list... You can ver­ify here www.mas.gov.sg/in­vestor-alert-list”.</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) is aware of com­pa­nies us­ing its name to lure cus­tomers with false as­sur­ances.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the fact that a com­pany is not listed on its In­vestor Alert List does not mean it is reg­u­lated or ap­proved by MAS, says a spokesman for the author­ity.</p>
    <p>The list, which is not ex­haus­tive, in­dexes un­reg­u­lated en­ti­ties that give the im­pres­sion of be­ing li­censed or reg­u­lated by MAS.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to note that MAS’ reg­u­la­tory safe­guards ap­ply only to reg­u­lated en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>“Hence, con­sumers must ex­er­cise cau­tion when deal­ing with all un­reg­u­lated en­ti­ties, in­clud­ing en­ti­ties that may not be listed on the In­vestor Alert List,” the spokesman says.</p>
    <p>It would be un­wise to base any in­vest­ment de­ci­sion on whether a com­pany has been flagged by MAS on its alert list, as the au­thor­i­ties can­not im­me­di­ately iden­tify ev­ery sin­gle du­bi­ous case since new en­ti­ties can ap­pear any time.</p>
    <p>So the safest way is for in­vestors to deal with com­pa­nies that are listed on MAS’ Fi­nan­cial In­sti­tu­tions Di­rec­tory, which lists fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions reg­u­lated by MAS, as well as the ac­tiv­i­ties they are au­tho­rised to pro­vide.</p>
    <p>The spokesman says: “MAS strongly en­cour­ages con­sumers to deal only with en­ti­ties reg­u­lated by MAS, so that they will be pro­tected by the laws ad­min­is­tered by MAS.</p>
    <p>“Our reg­u­la­tory regime seeks to en­sure that in­vestors re­ceive ad­e­quate in­for­ma­tion to make well-in­formed in­vest­ment de­ci­sions, and are dealt with fairly by prod­uct dis­trib­u­tors.”</p>
    <p>This fol­lows its ad­vi­sory to Sin­ga­pore­ans to be wary of ir­re­spon­si­ble sales tac­tics of some par­ties here that use the fear of un­cer­tain­ties in a pan­demic, as well as the prom­ise of easy money, to lure peo­ple into sign­ing up for their prop­erty in­vest­ment cour­ses.</p>
    <p>POS­SI­BLE TO OWN PROP­ER­TIES EAS­ILY?</p>
    <p>The claim that even those who face job un­cer­tain­ties now can sud­denly own mul­ti­ple prop­er­ties overnight with­out hav­ing large sums of cash for the down pay­ment is cer­tainly too good to be true.</p>
    <p>The premise is sim­ple: Bor­row money from the bank, buy mul­ti­ple com­mer­cial prop­er­ties and col­lect rent to pay for the loan.</p>
    <p>If you own mul­ti­ple prop­er­ties, this means mul­ti­ple sources of pas­sive in­come so you no longer have to work.</p>
    <p>Of course, happy end­ings are guar­an­teed in a make-be­lieve world.</p>
    <p>If this is so easy, the most cov­eted po­si­tion in Sin­ga­pore should be that of a land­lord, since it is only about earn­ing money and no work.</p>
    <p>Yes, it is pos­si­ble to own a prop­erty with­out any cash be­cause you can bor­row money from your rel­a­tives or pool money with friends to make the pur­chase.</p>
    <p>But this is a highly ir­re­spon­si­ble act be­cause you are in­vest­ing with other peo­ple’s money.</p>
    <p>As with gam­bling, you may win, but what if you lose?</p>
    <p>In good times, prop­erty in­vest­ment does sound like a good idea, but the whole world now is be­ing rav­aged by a pan­demic that is not ready to go away yet.</p>
    <p>If well-known com­pa­nies here and around the world can fail due to ex­treme poor busi­ness now, what makes you think your in­vest­ment prop­erty will still yield high rental in­come for you?</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, if the go­ing is so good, why would the cur­rent owner sell the unit to you when he can col­lect his rent and en­joy pas­sive in­come?</p>
    <p>A savvy in­vestor is some­one who has made plans for the worst-case sce­nario so that a fail­ure does not ruin his life.</p>
    <p>So those who play with money that they do not have should think hard about whether they want to put them­selves un­der such great risk.</p>
    <p>Here are some pru­dent tips on prop­erty in­vest­ment from MAS worth heed­ing.</p>
    <p>NO QUICK GAINS WITH PROP­ER­TIES</p>
    <p>Buy­ing a prop­erty is a long-term com­mit­ment that car­ries an obli­ga­tion to ser­vice mort­gage pay­ments.</p>
    <p>It is not with­out risk, and these risks can greatly in­crease with debt lever­age, rise in in­ter­est rates and dur­ing eco­nomic down­turns that can af­fect prop­erty prices and rental yields neg­a­tively.</p>
    <p>So, you should buy a prop­erty only after care­ful con­sid­er­a­tion of your means to af­ford it, es­pe­cially dur­ing a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>SET­TING UP COM­PA­NIES</p>
    <p>You can set up a com­pany to buy com­mer­cial prop­er­ties. But banks will per­form due dili­gence to check the cred­it­wor­thi­ness of the peo­ple be­hind such ven­tures.</p>
    <p>So those who try to over-lever­age on their bor­row­ings for spec­u­la­tive pur­poses will prob­a­bly get much smaller loans now.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the re­cent spate of ir­re­spon­si­ble busi­ness tac­tics and MAS’ ad­vi­sory, you can ex­pect banks to scru­ti­nise each ap­pli­ca­tion more closely now to avoid hav­ing to fore­close on prop­er­ties that the bor­row­ers can­not af­ford.</p>
    <p>POOLING PEO­PLE TO­GETHER TO BUY PROP­ER­TIES|</p>
    <p>Even if you are only a co-owner, once a prop­erty loan is taken out, you can be li­able for the full prop­erty loan amount if other in­vestors bail out or if there is in­suf­fi­cient rental in­come to pay for the loan.</p>
    <p>There are also other costs such as stamp du­ties, prop­erty taxes and main­te­nance fees.</p>
    <p>Be­fore en­ter­ing into such deals, you should also as­cer­tain who or which en­tity is hold­ing the prop­erty ti­tle deed and whether the holder can sell the prop­erty uni­lat­er­ally.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, check the exit strat­egy on how you can cash out if you want to take profit or how much you stand to lose if the in­vest­ment fails.</p>
    <p>There is a rea­son why the Gov­ern­ment took the un­prece­dented step of en­act­ing a spe­cial law to grant rental waivers to both re­tail and com­mer­cial ten­ants here.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker and the lack of vis­i­tors have dealt a big blow to many busi­nesses here, with in­comes plung­ing to lev­els not seen in pre­vi­ous re­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>That many em­ploy­ees will still work from home in the months to come means that many com­pa­nies will be look­ing to cut their rental ex­penses on leas­ing of­fice and com­mer­cial space to re­duce costs.</p>
    <p>In such dire times, those who still buy prop­er­ties for rentals with­out re­gard to their af­ford­abil­ity are truly ir­re­spon­si­ble about the well­be­ing of their fam­i­lies.</p>
