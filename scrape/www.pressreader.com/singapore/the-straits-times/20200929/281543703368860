    <p>A loop­hole in the pri­vate prop­erty mar­ket has been plugged to make sure that buyers do not end up com­mit­ting to new homes they can­not af­ford. The move is aimed at en­cour­ag­ing fi­nan­cial pru­dence among home buyers amid Sin­ga­pore’s worst re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>A loop­hole in the pri­vate prop­erty mar­ket has been plugged to make sure that buyers do not end up com­mit­ting to new homes they can­not af­ford. The move is aimed at en­cour­ag­ing fi­nan­cial pru­dence amid Sin­ga­pore’s worst re­ces­sion and ris­ing job losses.</p>
    <p>Start­ing yes­ter­day, de­vel­op­ers will no longer be able to re-is­sue a prospec­tive buyer’s op­tion to pur­chase (OTP) a res­i­den­tial unit for mul­ti­ple times on their own.</p>
    <p>Un­der a stan­dard OTP, new home buyers get around three weeks in which they re­serve their rights to pur­chase a prop­erty in re­turn for a book­ing fee. If they fail to ex­er­cise the op­tion to pur­chase at the end of three weeks, they risk for­feit­ing 25 per cent of their book­ing fees – or 1.25 per cent of the to­tal home price – an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>Some de­vel­op­ers have been con­tin­u­ally re-is­su­ing OTPs to prospec­tive home buyers for months on end, with­out for­feit­ing any por­tion of their book­ing fees, while these buyers try to se­cure fi­nances to com­plete the pur­chase.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new guide­lines, de­vel­op­ers can no longer re-is­sue an OTP to the same buyer for the same unit for 12 months af­ter the ear­lier OTP ex­pires. They also have to in­form buyers of this con­di­tion up­front. This move will weed out those who are less con­fi­dent of com­mit­ting to a pur­chase, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>“The need for greater fi­nan­cial dis­ci­pline in mak­ing prop­erty pur­chase de­ci­sions is es­pe­cially per­ti­nent given the cur­rent eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion, where work­ers are fac­ing un­cer­tain­ties in the labour mar­ket. Pur­chasers should com­mit to a prop­erty pur­chase only when they are ready to ex­er­cise the OTP within the va­lid­ity pe­riod,” Ms Ling Hui Lin, con­troller of hous­ing at the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, said in yes­ter­day’s cir­cu­lar.</p>
    <p>The URA ob­served that “there have been in­stances where the OTP is re-is­sued mul­ti­ple times to the same pur­chaser(s) for the same unit, which length­ens the op­tion pe­riod sig­nif­i­cantly”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tri­cia Song, head of re­search at Col­liers in­ter­na­tional, said: “This will prob­a­bly in­stil greater fi­nan­cial dis­ci­pline to home buyers in prop­erty-buy­ing de­ci­sions with the fol­low­ing mes­sag­ing: Do your sums first be­fore you com­mit – if you are not able to get a loan or pay for it in three weeks, you prob­a­bly should not agree to buy it now.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Karamjit Singh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Show­suite Con­sul­tancy, said that for gen­uine buyers who can prove that they can sell their ex­ist­ing home within 12 weeks, the con­troller of hous­ing is pre­pared to con­sider ex­tend­ing the three-week op­tion va­lid­ity pe­riod to 12 weeks. This is an in­crease from the eight weeks pre­vi­ously given.</p>
    <p>URA also said the new guide­lines do not ap­ply ret­ro­spec­tively to OTPs is­sued be­fore yes­ter­day where de­vel­op­ers have an ex­ist­ing re-is­sue agree­ment with buyers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the prac­tice of reis­su­ing OTPs had also raised con­cerns about whether data in the new home sales mar­ket could be dis­torted if many such buyers end up abort­ing the deals.</p>
    <p>To en­sure the ac­cu­racy of the de­vel­op­ers’ sales data, which is based on the num­ber of OTPs is­sued to buyers, URA told The Straits Times that the sales data “ex­cludes any OTPs re-is­sued to the same pur­chaser(s) for the same units”.</p>
    <p>Col­liers’ Ms Song said gen­uine buyers are more likely to step for­ward un­der the new guide­lines, which would suit de­vel­op­ers too.</p>
    <p>Show­suite Con­sul­tancy’s Mr Singh be­lieves the new rules will not likely be a ma­jor damp­ener for the new homes mar­ket, es­pe­cially in the mass-mar­ket seg­ment.</p>
    <p>He pointed to l ast week­end’s launch of Pen­rose con­do­minium by Hong Leong Hold­ings. Of its 566 units, 341 were sold as at Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“Hong Leong prac­tised a strict ‘no re-is­sue’ pol­icy. This means all the buyers would be re­quired to ex­er­cise their op­tions within three weeks of be­ing served the sale and pur­chase agree­ments,” he said.</p>
    <p>The need for pru­dence in the prop­erty mar­ket is even more acute now given an un­cer­tain eco­nomic climate and ris­ing re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers say the is­sue has come to the fore in the light of con­cerns that the ap­par­ent ro­bust pri­vate home sales in the past few months amid a se­vere re­ces­sion are giv­ing rise to a dis­torted per­cep­tion of the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>This may have prompted the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA) to im­pose new re­stric­tions on de­vel­op­ers re-is­su­ing op­tions to pur­chase (OTP).</p>
    <p>The new rule that came into force yes­ter­day will pre­vent de­vel­op­ers from con­tin­u­ally re-is­su­ing OTPs to home buyers who are strug­gling to line up fi­nance.</p>
    <p>When an OTP ex­pires now, de­vel­op­ers must not re-is­sue a fresh one to the same buyer for the same unit within 12 months af­ter the ex­piry of the ear­lier OTP. De­vel­op­ers are also not al­lowed to pro­vide up­front agree­ments to buyers re­gard­ing an OTP be­ing re-is­sued.</p>
    <p>Un­der the terms of a stan­dard OTP, new home buyers have three weeks to ex­er­cise the OTP. If a buyer fails to ex­er­cise the OTP, he risks for­feit­ing 25 per cent of the fee or 1.25 per cent of the pur­chase price.</p>
    <p>Un­der the old prac­tice, buyers could se­cure a unit at a cer­tain price no mat­ter what con­di­tion the econ­omy was in and de­vel­op­ers could keep re-is­su­ing OTPs mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>If the buyer even­tu­ally backed out, he would for­feit 25 per cent of the book­ing fee, as re­mains the case in the new regime.</p>
    <p>The new guide­lines dis­cour­age un­cer­tain buyers from tak­ing risks, noted Mr Ong Teck Hui, se­nior di­rec­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy at JLL Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They do not ap­ply ret­ro­spec­tively to OTPs is­sued be­fore yes­ter­day where de­vel­op­ers have an ex­ist­ing re-is­sue agree­ment with buyers.</p>
    <p>Ms Tri­cia Song, head of re­search at Col­liers in­ter­na­tional, noted that de­vel­oper sales “typ­i­cally have 100 to 130 units ‘re­turned’ ev­ery month, prob­a­bly due to the in­def­i­nite reis­suance of OTPs”. There were 1,080 pri­vate homes ex­clud­ing ex­ec­u­tive con­do­mini­ums re­ported sold by de­vel­op­ers in July. Ms Song said that if the sales tally of each project last month was com­pared with July’s fig­ures, there was a dis­crep­ancy of 127 units that ap­peared to have been re­turned dur­ing the month.</p>
    <p>“There are, of course, real cases of need such as pur­chasers who may re­quire more time to com­plete the sale of their ex­ist­ing prop­erty be­fore ex­er­cis­ing the OTP,” she added. “For these cases, the URA now al­lows ex­ten­sion of va­lid­ity of the OTP by up to 12 weeks, sub­ject to mu­tual agree­ment of de­vel­oper and buyer.”</p>
    <p>The Real Es­tate De­vel­op­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (Redas) said it was “heart­ened by (the URA’s) flex­i­bil­ity” on this. It is an in­crease from the eight weeks given pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Redas noted: “Most buyers do ex­er­cise fi­nan­cial pru­dence be­fore they take up the OTP and buy only within their means.”</p>
    <p>The new rules could slightly dam­pen sales in the fourth quar­ter, said Ms Chris­tine Li, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia at Cush­man & Wake­field. But she main­tained there is gen­uine de­mand.</p>
    <p>Caveats from Realis showed that 2,047 units were sold in July and last month, 30.5 per cent up on the 1,568 sold in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
