    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ment mis­take? A My big­gest in­vest­ment mis­take was when I failed to take the ad­vice I gave to a friend.</p>
    <p>A few years ago, I was asked about Nep­tune Ori­ent Lines as I was work­ing at Maersk Group then. My re­sponse was that I saw a greater po­ten­tial in the in­tra-Asia lines and told them to look at an un­der­val­ued stock called Sa­mud­era.</p>
    <p>A few of my friends acted on it and the stock price jumped more than two times. Un­for­tu­nately, I did not act on it my­self.</p>
    <p>But while it was a missed op­por­tu­nity, I do not re­ally re­gret it, as I be­lieve there are other op­por­tu­ni­ties to look for­ward to and I be­lieve in fu­ture chances.</p>
    <p>Q What has been your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A I would say it has been ed­u­ca­tion. My par­ents are firm be­liev­ers in ed­u­ca­tion and sent me for var­i­ous tu­ition and en­rich­ment cour­ses.</p>
    <p>I was part of a pi­o­neer batch of stu­dents ex­posed to ac­cel­er­ated learn­ing in Sin­ga­pore, and I be­lieve this set the foun­da­tion for who I am to­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­a­tion, I saw huge po­ten­tial in the dig­i­tal space and de­cided to go for many dif­fer­ent cour­ses re­lated to dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, this has con­trib­uted to my work now with tech start-ups.</p>
    <p>My big­gest in­vest­ment re­turn was on Citi. I was in my first year of univer­sity then when the 2008 sub-prime cri­sis hap­pened. I went in on Citi’s stock price when it dropped to US$1, and I got a good re­turn on it.</p>
    <p>How­ever, look­ing back, I might have taken too high a risk then; it could have back­fired.</p>
    <p>From a ca­reer stand­point, I feel my best in­vest­ment was join­ing KPMG’s cor­po­rate fi­nance team.</p>
    <p>Its head of merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions and cap­i­tal ad­vi­sory, Mr Ben­jamin Ong, was a fab­u­lous men­tor whom I look up to, and he is one of the rea­sons why I had the con­fi­dence to set up my own prac­tice.</p>
