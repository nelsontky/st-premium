    <p>A 47-year-old pae­dophile who took his lover’s two chil­dren to a ho­tel in Gey­lang for “sleep­overs” – mak­ing the girl, eight, and boy, nine, per­form sex­ual acts on each other – was jailed for 24 years and given 24 strokes of the cane yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The High Court heard that the man told the sib­lings, who have low IQ, to re-en­act scenes from porno­graphic videos and made them re­peat the acts un­til he was sat­is­fied with the record­ings he was mak­ing on his phone.</p>
    <p>He started prey­ing on them in 2012 – less than two years fol­low­ing his re­lease from prison af­ter serv­ing 12 months for sex­u­ally abus­ing his four-year-old daugh­ter – and car­ried on un­til 2014, when the girl told her mother that she did not want to see him any­more.</p>
    <p>Four years later, the man chanced upon the girl, then 14, and got her to have sex with him on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>The of­fences came to light last year af­ter the boy was ar­rested for theft and hav­ing con­sen­sual sex with a mi­nor, and dis­closed to a psy­chol­o­gist that he had been sex­u­ally abused when he was younger.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the man pleaded guilty to three charges – two for sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion of a mi­nor and one for abetment of sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion of a mi­nor.</p>
    <p>An­other 13 charges, mostly for sex­ual of­fences, were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The man, who was last em­ployed as a kitchen worker, has not been named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect the iden­ti­ties of the vic­tims.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the sib­lings’ mother, a cleaner, was hav­ing an af­fair with the man, her su­per­vi­sor at work, in 2012.</p>
    <p>He had reg­u­lar din­ners with the fam­ily, in­clud­ing the sib­lings’ fa­ther, and of­ten took the chil­dren out for meals and ar­cade games by him­self.</p>
    <p>The sib­lings’ mother al­lowed them to spend the night with him.</p>
    <p>Records from the ho­tel showed that be­tween May 2012 and July 2014, he had checked in 24 times.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing these “sleep­overs”, he made the chil­dren watch porno­graphic videos and in­structed them to per­form the sex­ual scenes, which he recorded for his sub­se­quent view­ing plea­sure.</p>
    <p>He also threat­ened the sib­lings with beat­ings, mak­ing them re­peat the acts un­til they met his ex­pec­ta­tions. The abuse stopped af­ter the girl told her mother that she did not want to meet him any­more, on the pre­text that he had beat her and her brother up. She did not disclose the sex­ual abuse.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the man and the girl re­con­nected. He made sex­ual ad­vances to­wards her and she agreed to have sex with him in ex­change for cig­a­rettes and money.</p>
    <p>He recorded the sex­ual acts on his phone and also told her to make au­dio record­ings of her hav­ing sex with other peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The man was ar­rested on Jan 30 last year af­ter the psy­chol­o­gist who con­ducted the as­sess­ment on the boy alerted the po­lice.</p>
    <p>The girl was later as­sessed to be func­tion­ing within the very low range of in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>She told a child psy­chol­o­gist that she felt “dis­gusted and bad” about what was done to her.</p>
    <p>The boy was as­sessed to be in­tel­lec­tu­ally dis­abled, with an IQ of 59. He re­ported feel­ing as if he had been “tor­tured” by the man.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Eu­nice Lau sought 26 years’ jail and the max­i­mum 24 strokes of the cane for the man, not­ing that he has been as­sessed as hav­ing a high risk of sex­ual re­of­fend­ing.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused is a pae­dophile who has re­peat­edly ex­ploited young chil­dren as sex ob­jects for his per­verse grat­i­fi­ca­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>The DPP added that the sib­lings’ low in­tel­lec­tual abil­i­ties made them even more sus­cep­ti­ble.</p>
    <p>How­ever, de­fence lawyer Sofia Ben­nita Mo­hamed Bakhash said the man did not know at that time that the chil­dren had low IQ.</p>
