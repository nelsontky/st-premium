    <p>LON­DON • Frank Lampard be­lieves Chelsea have be­come com­pla­cent af­ter the Blues blew a lead to lose 2-1 at Wolves on Tues­day, suf­fer­ing back-to-back Pre­mier League de­feats for the first time un­der his man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>For the sec­ond time in four days, the Blues have wasted the chance to move top of the Pre­mier League. They lost for the first time in 18 matches in all com­pe­ti­tions at Ever­ton on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Lampard him­self called i nto ques­tion his side’s ti­tle cre­den­tials af­ter the 1-0 loss at Good­i­son Park and feels his play­ers may have got car­ried away with their un­beaten run.</p>
    <p>“Per­for­mance is what gives you re­sults. We were play­ing very well, on a long un­beaten run and then maybe the lads think, ‘We’re play­ing well’,” he said. “The minute you think you’re play­ing well, things like this can hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>Lampard ad­mit­ted he was par­tic­u­larly irked af­ter Pe­dro Neto broke clear to win the game in the 95th minute.</p>
    <p>Olivier Giroud had grabbed the opener for the vis­i­tors, who also hit the bar through Kurt Zouma, only for Daniel Po­dence to equalise in the sec­ond half with a slightly de­flected strike.</p>
    <p>“If you’re not play­ing well, which we weren’t tonight, hang on to the 1-0. Play, con­trol the game, and don’t al­low counter-at­tacks like we did,” said Lampard.</p>
    <p>There was more ev­i­dence that Chelsea are still a team in tran­si­tion af­ter a £220 mil­lion (S$395.4 mil­lion) sum­mer spend­ing spree as two of their big money sign­ings, Timo Werner and Kai Havertz, failed to sparkle at Mo­lineux.</p>
    <p>Lampard’s men re­main in fifth on 22 points, three adrift of co-lead­ers Tot­ten­ham and Liver­pool, who played each other yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory was no more than Wolves de­served as they bounced back from two con­sec­u­tive de­feats since los­ing Mex­i­can striker and top scorer Raul Jimenez to a frac­tured skull.</p>
    <p>“We re­acted well,” said Wolves boss Nuno Espir­ito Santo. “I think we were al­ways in the game. We were well or­gan­ised and in the sec­ond half, we played re­ally well.</p>
    <p>“We al­ways men­tion char­ac­ter. It’s there when things go well for us, and it’s still there when things aren’t go­ing so well.</p>
    <p>“Foot­ball is a game that is played un­til the last whis­tle and this is what is most im­por­tant, the char­ac­ter along with the fo­cus.</p>
    <p>“We have com­mit­ment, with the sup­port of each other. This is what I think is char­ac­ter.”</p>
