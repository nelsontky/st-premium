    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport’s (CAS) de­ci­sion to halve Rus­sia’s dop­ing ban on Thurs­day has been de­cried as a “tragedy” for the global fight against drug cheats by sev­eral bodies.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing the crit­i­cism was United States Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Usada) chief ex­ec­u­tive Travis Ty­gart, who said the CAS de­ci­sion – which cut Rus­sia’s pro­posed four-year ban to two years – rep­re­sented a “sig­nif­i­cant loss” for the World Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Wada) and clean ath­letes.</p>
    <p>He added: “While the first in­stinct is to ex­press ob­vi­ous shock, the fact is we should have all seen this com­ing.</p>
    <p>“Wada and the IOC (In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee) have ma­nip­u­lated and mis­han­dled this sor­did Rus­sian state-dop­ing affair from day one and have put pol­i­tics over prin­ci­ple once again.”</p>
    <p>The two-year sanc­tion bars Rus­sia from send­ing an of­fi­cial del­e­ga­tion to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the 2022 Win­ter Olympics and the 2022 World Cup but al­lows Rus­sian ath­letes to com­pete in those events un­der a neu­tral ban­ner.</p>
    <p>Those ath­letes will still be able to com­pete in uni­forms in Rus­sian colours with the word “Rus­sia” on them, and Rus­sian govern­ment of­fi­cials can still at­tend the Games if in­vited by host na­tions.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar rules were in ef­fect for Rus­sian ath­letes at the 2018 Pyeongchan­g Win­ter Olympics.</p>
    <p>Ty­gart was not alone in be­ing up­set. In­ter­na­tional ath­lete-led move­ments Global Ath­lete and The Ath­let­ics As­so­ci­a­tion said: “The fact that Rus­sian ath­letes can com­plete as ‘Neu­tral Ath­letes from Rus­sia’ is an­other far­ci­cal fa­cade that makes a mock­ery of the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“If ath­letes from Rus­sia can still com­pete, it is not a sanc­tion. Rus­sia has not been banned; they have sim­ply been re­branded.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Par­a­lympic sil­ver medal­list Ali Jawad said: “The events of the last five years, the lack of ath­lete voices, and the con­stant com­pro­mise with Rus­sia has made me re­alise that Wada is not fit for pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>Ty­gart added: “It’s rid­dled with so many loop­holes. IOC mem­bers are ex­empt from the ban. Ath­lete sup­port per­son­nel and govern­ment of­fi­cials are ex­empt from it.</p>
    <p>“There’s no con­se­quence on those folks even if they were in­volved with di­rectly per­pe­trat­ing fraud in the past.”</p>
    <p>Wada had im­posed a four-year ban on Rus­sia af­ter find­ing that Moscow had ma­nip­u­lated ev­i­dence from a lab­o­ra­tory database handed over to in­ves­ti­ga­tors prob­ing the long-run­ning dop­ing scan­dal.</p>
    <p>Ty­gart said that at­tempts to al­ter ev­i­dence showed Rus­sia had not been de­terred by ear­lier sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>“They’ve been given chance af­ter chance af­ter chance,” he said. “Pyeongchan­g didn’t change their be­hav­iour and we know that be­cause they ma­nip­u­lated the database af­ter that.</p>
    <p>“So to be given yet an­other weak and loop­hole-rid­dled out­come is just a tragedy for the over­all global ef­fort.”</p>
    <p>He also ques­tioned the abil­ity of au­thor­i­ties to mon­i­tor Rus­sian ath­letes al­lowed to com­pete at the Olympics un­der a neu­tral ban­ner, adding that test­ing re­quire­ments for the Rus­sians com­pet­ing in Tokyo were not known.</p>
    <p>“There is a lack of trans­parency and un­will­ing­ness to cre­ate a stan­dard that would hold them ac­count­able,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We put our in­di­vid­ual test his­to­ries on our web­site. So you can go and see how many times (US swim­mer) Katie Ledecky has been tested by us. The world’s not go­ing to get any of that in­for­ma­tion from Rus­sia if the sta­tus quo re­mains.”</p>
    <p>Speaking to re­porters on Thurs­day, the Rus­sian Olympic Com­mit­tee’s pres­i­dent Stanislav Pozd­nyakov ex­pressed sat­is­fac­tion that the CAS had not “col­lec­tively” banned Rus­sia’s ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Mikhail Bukhanov, act­ing head of the coun­try’s anti-dop­ing agency Rusada, said: “To­day’s re­sults are a vic­tory for Rus­sia. The court de­cided not to ac­cept the the­ses that Wada de­manded. Of course, this is a sig­nif­i­cant prece­dent.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he blasted CAS’ “un­ac­cept­able” de­ci­sion to ban Rus­sia’s high-rank­ing of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing the coun­try’s pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, from at­tend­ing the Games.</p>
    <p>Wada and the IOC have ma­nip­u­lated and mis­han­dled this sor­did Rus­sian state-dop­ing affair from day one and have put pol­i­tics over prin­ci­ple once again.</p>
