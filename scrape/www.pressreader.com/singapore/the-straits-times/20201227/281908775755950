    <p>The tourism in­dus­try has had a dif­fi­cult 12 months, to say the least, so it has rel­ished the op­por­tu­nity to mark two ma­jor achieve­ments from last year – the open­ing of Jewel Changi Air­port and the re­vamped Raf­fles Ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Both des­ti­na­tions won big at the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Awards, which recog­nised 29 in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions for their con­tri­bu­tions last year.</p>
    <p>Jewel Changi Air­port clinched the top award for its break­through con­tri­bu­tions to tourism while also pick­ing up gongs for the best shop­ping mall and best at­trac­tion ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have to make a con­scious ef­fort to visit Jewel, which doesn’t have a cen­tral lo­ca­tion. The fact that it can still at­tract both tourists and Sin­ga­porean shop­pers is a tes­ta­ment to its ap­peal,” said Ms Es­ther Ho, di­rec­tor of Nanyang Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), which gives out the awards and an­nounced the win­ners on its Face­book page on Dec 18, noted that Jewel had at­tracted about 50 mil­lion vis­i­tors within six months of its open­ing in April last year, sur­pass­ing its ini­tial annual tar­get of 40 to 50 mil­lion vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Jewel chief ex­ec­u­tive Hung Jean said the de­vel­op­ment has con­trib­uted to the re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion of the Sin­ga­pore tourism scene.</p>
    <p>“In the com­ing year, we look for­ward to wel­com­ing guests with re­freshed of­fer­ings so that ev­ery guest, whether a first-time or re­peat vis­i­tor, will be con­stantly sur­prised and de­lighted,” she added.</p>
    <p>Raf­fles Ho­tel, which re­opened to great fan­fare in Au­gust last year, got the nod for best ho­tel ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>STB’s di­rec­tor of com­mu­ni­ca­tions and mar­ket­ing ca­pa­bil­ity Ter­rence Voon said: “The ho­tel staff were ob­served to epit­o­mise ser­vice of the high­est standard. Many of the front-desk staff knew the guests by their names.”</p>
    <p>Raf­fles Ho­tel’s gen­eral man­ager Chris­tian West­beld said: “Our col­leagues’ out­stand­ing re­silience and re­source­ful­ness have con­trib­uted to this in­cred­i­ble and hum­bling mile­stone.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ho noted that the her­itage ho­tel’s shop­ping ar­cade may have helped ce­ment its win. “The ar­cade has brands you don’t find in many places like multi-label store The AC and (restaurant) Burger & Lob­ster,” she said.</p>
    <p>Wildlife con­sul­tant Subaraj Ra­jathu­rai, who died in Oc­to­ber last year, was awarded a life­time achieve­ment award for his out­stand­ing con­tri­bu­tions to tourism.</p>
    <p>“In more than 35 years of his ca­reer as a wildlife expert, Mr Subaraj had worked tire­lessly to pre­serve some of Sin­ga­pore’s green ecosys­tems,” said Mr Voon.</p>
    <p>Mr Subaraj, the first na­ture guide li­censed by the STB, had con­ducted na­ture walks since 1990. He helped se­cure the con­ser­va­tion of the Sungei Bu­loh man­grove for­est and was part of a re­search team that saved more than 100ha of for­est at Lower Peirce Reser­voir.</p>
    <p>“This is a big hon­our for our fam­ily,” said Mrs Shamla Subaraj, who is di­rec­tor of Strix Wildlife Con­sul­tancy which her hus­band founded.</p>
    <p>“My only wish is that Subaraj could have been here to re­ceive this award. He would have been so ex­cited.”</p>
