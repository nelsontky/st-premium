    <p>Core con­sumer prices fell for the tenth straight month in Novem­ber amid a pan­demic-in­duced eco­nomic down­turn that weighed on do­mes­tic de­mand, although de­fla­tion eased slightly.</p>
    <p>Core in­fla­tion, which ex­cludes ac­com­mo­da­tion and pri­vate road trans­port costs, came in at mi­nus 0.1 per cent year on year last month, slightly above the mi­nus 0.2 per cent seen in Oc­to­ber, said the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) and Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket ex­pec­ta­tions for core in­fla­tion to be mi­nus 0.1 per cent last month were right on the money, ac­cord­ing to a me­dian fore­cast of econ­o­mists polled by Reuters.</p>
    <p>The con­tin­ued fall in prices is the long­est since 1991, the ear­li­est pe­riod for which such core in­fla­tion data is avail­able on the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics web­site.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s core prices pre­vi­ously fell for nine con­sec­u­tive months in 2008 and 2009, dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>UOB se­nior economist Alvin Liew said that while fall­ing con­sumer prices may per­sist this</p>
    <p>month, pock­ets of in­fla­tion from food, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and ve­hi­cle costs could con­tinue to cush­ion the de­fla­tion­ary ef­fects from other cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>He added that de­mand for yearend lo­cal hol­i­days may also lead to a tem­po­rary in­crease in de­mand for ser­vices and push up their ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The long streak of fall­ing prices came as no sur­prise. Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, said that dur­ing a re­ces­sion, con­sumers cut back on spend­ing, and firms may re­duce prices to mit­i­gate the fall in busi­ness, re­sult­ing in de­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing economist Song Seng Wun said prices are tied to busi­ness and con­sumer sen­ti­ment. “If busi­nesses are will­ing to hire and in­vest, wages will go up, which will lead to more spend­ing.”</p>
    <p>But in­stead, Sin­ga­pore has been see­ing less spend­ing and fall­ing prices over the past 10 months.</p>
    <p>Over­all in­fla­tion rose to mi­nus 0.1 per cent year on year last month, from mi­nus 0.2 per cent the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>The slower rate of de­cline in prices last month was mainly due to a smaller fall in the costs of ser­vices and elec­tric­ity and gas, as well as higher food in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric­ity and gas costs fell more mod­estly at 6.8 per cent, com­pared with the 7.2 per cent de­cline the pre­vi­ous month, as tar­geted util­i­ties re­bates ceased in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The cost of re­tail and other goods fell more sharply at 2 per cent, com­pared with a 1.6 per cent de­cline in Oc­to­ber, due to a larger de­cline in cloth­ing and footwear prices and a slower pace of in­crease in house­hold durable costs.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, food in­fla­tion edged up 1.8 per cent last month com­pared with 1.7 per cent the pre­vi­ous month, mainly due to a steeper rise in the prices of non-cooked food and restau­rant meals.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­mo­da­tion in­fla­tion was un­changed at 0.3 per cent as hous­ing rents rose at a pace sim­i­lar to Oc­to­ber’s.</p>
    <p>MAS and MTI said ex­ter­nal in­fla­tion is likely to re­main low in the quar­ters ahead amid weak de­mand con­di­tions in key com­mod­ity mar­kets and the con­tin­ued spare ca­pac­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s ma­jor trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>Cost pres­sures are also ex­pected to stay sub­dued lo­cally, with the ac­cu­mu­lated slack in the labour mar­ket damp­en­ing wages.</p>
    <p>How­ever, core in­fla­tion is fore­cast to turn “mildly pos­i­tive” next year, with de­mand for some do­mes­tic ser­vices grad­u­ally pick­ing up and the dis­in­fla­tion­ary ef­fects of gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies in­tro­duced this year fad­ing.</p>
    <p>“Mean­while, ac­com­mo­da­tion costs are ex­pected to fall as rentals could soften, due in part to the de­cline in for­eign em­ploy­ment,” said MAS and MTI.</p>
    <p>“In com­par­i­son, pri­vate trans­port costs should rise mod­estly amid an an­tic­i­pated re­duc­tion in the sup­ply of cer­tifi­cates of en­ti­tle­ment in 2021,” they added.</p>
    <p>MAS and MTI re­it­er­ated their core and over­all in­fla­tion fore­cast of between mi­nus 0.5 per cent and 0 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Core in­fla­tion is ex­pected to av­er­age between 0 per cent and 1 per cent next year, while over­all in­fla­tion is fore­cast to be between mi­nus 0.5 and 0.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Barclays Bank economist Brian Tan said the bank main­tains its full-year core in­fla­tion fore­cast of mi­nus 0.1 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>With core in­fla­tion likely to start ris­ing again, he ex­pects MAS to leave its pol­icy set­tings un­changed at its next pol­icy re­view in April.</p>
    <p>UOB se­nior economist Alvin Liew said that while fall­ing con­sumer prices may per­sist this month, pock­ets of in­fla­tion from food, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and ve­hi­cle costs could con­tinue to cush­ion the de­fla­tion­ary ef­fects from other cat­e­gories. He added that de­mand for year-end lo­cal hol­i­days may also lead to a tem­po­rary in­crease in de­mand for ser­vices and push up their prices.</p>
