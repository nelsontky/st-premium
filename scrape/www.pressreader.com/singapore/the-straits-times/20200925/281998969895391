    <p>Sin­ga­pore is eight months into its fight against Covid-19. And there is some cause for cheer in how we are wag­ing the war against the virus here.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble, at an av­er­age of fewer than one a day in the past two weeks. There have been no pa­tients in in­ten­sive care since early last month.</p>
    <p>But it is pre­cisely these en­cour­ag­ing signs that are prompt­ing some to let their guard down – and it will take only one crack, one clus­ter form­ing, to ruin ev­ery­thing we in Sin­ga­pore have sac­ri­ficed so much for.</p>
    <p>The fact is, de­spite ev­ery­thing we have en­dured – in­clud­ing un­prece­dented re­stric­tions, be­ing sep­a­rated from loved ones for ex­tended pe­ri­ods of time, deaths and fu­ner­als by Zoom panel – the end is still far away, with mask wear­ing con­tin­u­ing to be the norm, and the econ­omy tak­ing a se­vere hit.</p>
    <p>Mass lo­cal dis­tri­bu­tion of a vac­cine in Sin­ga­pore – which could mark the be­gin­ning of a re­turn to nor­malcy – is still far out of reach, pos­si­bly not un­til the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Of course, a vac­cine is not the endgame. Post-vac­cine, we may well have to learn to live with the virus for the long term as it is likely to con­tinue to cir­cu­late glob­ally, and may even be im­pos­si­ble to erad­i­cate – but at least it will be with fewer daily dis­rup­tions and less stress.</p>
    <p>For now, the coun­try needs to fo­cus on get­ting to phase three – a “new nor­mal”.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial de­tails on what ex­actly this phase would en­tail have been scarce, but it will in­volve the re­sump­tion of so­cial, cul­tural, reli­gious and busi­ness gath­er­ings. Group size re­stric­tions may also be loos­ened.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, some of these changes are be­ing in­tro­duced: Small group ac­tiv­i­ties for se­niors re­cently re­sumed, and Sin­ga­pore is grad­u­ally re­open­ing its bor­ders to trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>More open­ing up may be in store. On Wed­nes­day, co-chair of the multi-min­istry task force Lawrence Wong said that the next few weeks may see Sin­ga­pore mov­ing along the road map to phase three, but it is con­tin­gent on ev­ery­one do­ing his part.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant at this stage that peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore per­sist and not let our guard down on mask wear­ing, hy­giene and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>A painful cir­cuit breaker ear­lier this year brought daily cases down sig­nif­i­cantly. We have al­ready made it through sev­eral rounds of mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But the cracks and ex­haus­tion are start­ing to show. Ear­lier this month, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong cited a Straits Times sur­vey that showed al­most half of the re­spon­dents were weary of pan­demic safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Only 43 per cent said they would al­ways obey safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures even if the au­thor­i­ties were not around, while an­other 43 per cent said they would ad­here to them most, but not all, of the time.</p>
    <p>And de­spite Covid-19 test­ing be­ing of­fered free to those who have acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion – a po­ten­tial warning sign of the coronaviru­s – one in four has de­clined such test­ing be­cause of the fear that it will be un­com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, as the econ­omy re­opens in stages, some peo­ple are try­ing to find “cre­ative” ways to flout the mea­sures that are meant to keep us safe.</p>
    <p>Dozens of out­lets have been pe­nalised for pulling stunts such as hid­ing beer in teapots, cit­ing “safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures” to keep en­force­ment of­fi­cers from con­duct­ing checks, and seat­ing groups of 10 din­ers in a pri­vate room when the limit for a group gath­er­ing is five. The pa­trons are equally to blame for their role in such breaches.</p>
    <p>This is a crit­i­cal junc­ture in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It is the equiv­a­lent of en­ter­ing the third lap of a 2.4km run that has six laps. Most peo­ple who grew up in Sin­ga­pore know the pain of that dreaded phys­i­cal-ed­u­ca­tion test – not short enough for you to sprint and get it over with quickly (like with the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome outbreak, which lasted about four months here), and not long enough that you can jog along slowly.</p>
    <p>In this race, the third lap makes it or breaks it. You are al­ready ex­hausted from run­ning nearly half the race, but it seems there is still no end in sight, and you just want to give up, which many run­ners with a promis­ing start end up do­ing.</p>
    <p>At that point, it is mind over mat­ter. It is the mid­point of the race, the tip­ping point; how we run this lap de­ter­mines if we can fin­ish the race well.</p>
    <p>RE­LAX­ING TOO EARLY</p>
    <p>Many other coun­tries have been at this stage, too, and re­laxed too early.</p>
    <p>South Korea was praised for con­trol­ling its outbreak without need­ing a lock­down, but saw a sec­ond wave when it eased so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines and peo­ple be­gan to visit bars and night­clubs.</p>
    <p>More than 35,000 peo­ple there had to be tested in May af­ter just one man who went club-hop­ping later turned out to be in­fected.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion de­clared the pan­demic “back in full swing” af­ter church mem­bers at­tended a protest, form­ing a new clus­ter.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has now had to ex­tend its so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures till Sun­day, and may do so be­yond its Chuseok hol­i­day, when fam­i­lies are tra­di­tion­ally reunited.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in Bri­tain, fol­low­ing the eas­ing of the coun­try’s first lock­down, crowds of peo­ple were re­ported to be ig­nor­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules and even protest­ing over the use of masks.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond lock­down is now loom­ing as cases surge once again, and Bri­tain’s death toll stands at more than 41,000 – the high­est in Europe. The au­thor­i­ties there have warned of a po­ten­tial 50,000 new daily cases if no ac­tion is taken.</p>
    <p>Even Viet­nam, ini­tially hailed as a haven from Covid-19 with no re­ported deaths, and months with no com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion, was forced into a lock­down fol­low­ing a sud­den spike at the end of July.</p>
    <p>Re­ports said that lo­cal res­i­dents had low­ered their guard about wear­ing masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing in public ow­ing to the seem­ing safety from the virus, with many also re­dou­bling their hol­i­days around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>There is a trou­bling pat­tern here: The virus hits a coun­try, mea­sures are put in place, cases drop, peo­ple get tired and com­pla­cent about public health mea­sures, num­bers soar again, and re­stric­tions are once again im­posed.</p>
    <p>WHAT ABOUT SIN­GA­PORE?</p>
    <p>Will we fall into the same pat­tern as other coun­tries?</p>
    <p>I am sure those of us who make com­pro­mises do not do it out of ma­li­cious in­tent to spread the virus fur­ther. Af­ter all, we may think that wear­ing a mask all day is so tir­ing, we can do without it some­times. And work­ing from home or get­ting re­trenched is al­ready stress­ful enough – do we not de­serve a lit­tle break?</p>
    <p>Per­haps. But in times of war, the enemy does not care how tired you are, or how dif­fi­cult life has been for you. And make no mis­take, we are at war with a per­ni­cious virus, one that we must ei­ther beat or be beaten by. It’s un­pleas­ant to hear, but it is true.</p>
    <p>But there is hope. Al­though Sin­ga­pore­ans are of­ten seen as a peo­ple who love to com­plain, when push comes to shove, we are sur­vivors, and we will over­come as we have ev­ery time in the past.</p>
    <p>Aside from fol­low­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, prac­tis­ing good hand hy­giene and wear­ing a mask, we should also look out for those around us who may have a hard time do­ing so.</p>
    <p>You can help out in your own small way, by en­cour­ag­ing your friends and loved ones to keep to the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>And yes, maybe Covid-19 cases will spring up again in spite of your best ef­forts, be­cause of other peo­ple’s in­con­sid­er­ate ac­tions. We can­not con­trol this.</p>
    <p>But when I look back on this cri­sis, I want to be able to tell my chil­dren that I did ev­ery­thing I could to lend a hand – that in times of trou­ble, I stood up for Sin­ga­pore, in my own small way.</p>
    <p>You may have a dif­fer­ent source of mo­ti­va­tion – it doesn’t mat­ter what it is. Just do it for the good of the coun­try, or for your fam­ily, friends or even your­self. What­ever it is, to adapt the lyrics of that same well-known song:</p>
