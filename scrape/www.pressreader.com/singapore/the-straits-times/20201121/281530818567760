    <p>Mr Nel­son Loh(far right), co-founder of Novena Global Health­care Group (NGHG) which is un­der po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion, has left Sin­ga­pore, said his cousin and for­mer busi­ness part­ner Ter­ence Loh (right). The Straits Times un­der­stands from sources that Mr Nel­son Loh is in China.</p>
    <p>Mr Nel­son Loh, 40, co-founder of Novena Global Health­care Group (NGHG) which is un­der po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions, has left Sin­ga­pore, said his cousin and for­mer busi­ness part­ner Ter­ence Loh.</p>
    <p>This came in a state­ment yes­ter­day from Mr Ter­ence Loh, 43, in re­sponse to an ap­pli­ca­tion by DBS Bank to wind up NGHG sub­sidiary Novena Global Health­care.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps more than any­one else, I feel deeply be­trayed by Nel­son, who has left Sin­ga­pore and ap­pears to have no in­ten­tion to sort out this ter­ri­ble mess we are left with.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands from sources that Mr Nel­son Loh is in China.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force said it is un­able to con­firm whether Mr Nel­son Loh has left the coun­try, while the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity said it can­not dis­cuss the de­tails of in­di­vid­ual cases for rea­sons of con­fi­den­tial­ity.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, DBS had ap­plied to the High Court to wind up Novena Global Health­care, which is be­lieved to owe the bank mil­lions of dol­lars. The ap­pli­ca­tion will be heard on Dec 11 and the sub­sidiary faces pos­si­ble liq­ui­da­tion if the court agrees.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore sub­sidiary of the Cay­man Is­lands-in­cor­po­rated group also faces fur­ther en­force­ment ac­tion from the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity for fail­ing to file its an­nual re­turns, due on June 29, 2018.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter sent to over 30 share­hold­ers yes­ter­day, Mr Ter­ence Loh said he has been as­sist­ing the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment on the al­leged forgery of cer­tain NGHG doc­u­ments. He wrote: “To up­date stake­hold­ers, these in­ves­ti­ga­tions have also in­cluded the flow of money from the loans, and the busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties of var­i­ous en­ti­ties of NGHG and re­lated par­ties.”</p>
    <p>But he said he “firmly be­lieves” the po­ten­tial liq­ui­da­tion of the Sin­ga­pore sub­sidiary, which op­er­ates six aes­thetic clin­ics in Sin­ga­pore, “may not nec­es­sar­ily re­sult in the demise” of the par­ent com­pany.</p>
    <p>Ac­count­ing and con­sult­ing firm RSM has been ap­pointed by the su­per­vi­sory com­mit­tee of NGHG to act as its spe­cial ac­coun­tant.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh said: “I will con­tinue to en­gage with RSM un­til any liq­ui­da­tion oc­curs and will as­sist any ap­pointed liq­uida­tors to re­cover value.”</p>
    <p>He also said that af­ter Mr Nel­son Loh left Sin­ga­pore, he had called for the first of sev­eral meet­ings on Sept 29 to dis­cuss with the five banks which have ex­tended loans to NGHG. These bank­ing re­la­tion­ships be­gan only less than a year ago, he added.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands from sources that the other banks are Citibank, United Over­seas Bank, May­bank and Stan­dard Char­tered Bank.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh also told share­hold­ers that he has been “sal­vaging the busi­ness in Tai­wan and in­creas­ing sales at the Novu level”.</p>
    <p>There are six Novu aes­thetic clin­ics – for­merly known as PPP Laser – in Sin­ga­pore, which are run by the group. When ST vis­ited two of the out­lets – at Raf­fles City and Be­dok Mall – yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, they were busy with cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>One cus­tomer from China, who wanted to be known only as Ms Lena, said she had been get­ting laser treat­ments at the clinic “since PPP days”. Just last week, she spent about $1,000 on a new pack­age for 22 laser treat­ments at the Raf­fles City out­let.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old, who works in the in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy sec­tor, said she was shocked to learn that the com­pany could face pos­si­ble liq­ui­da­tion. She said: “I was plan­ning to get a treat­ment next week, but the clinic is al­ready fully booked. Maybe I should try to book a slot at other out­lets and try to use up my pack­age soon.”</p>
    <p>A mem­ber of the staff at the Be­dok Mall out­let told ST that Mr Ter­ence Loh had in­formed them via e-mail yes­ter­day morn­ing about the pos­si­ble liq­ui­da­tion of the sub­sidiary and as­sured the staff that busi­ness would carry on.</p>
    <p>The per­son, who asked not to be named, said: “Even though there has been a lot of neg­a­tive news about the com­pany lately, busi­ness con­tin­ues to be good.</p>
    <p>“All the staff are paid on time. Some cus­tomers have asked if we will shut down, but when we told them no, they con­tinue to visit us to buy new pack­ages.</p>
    <p>“I think most peo­ple are not too wor­ried, be­cause our pack­ages are af­ford­able at just over $1,000, not $10,000.”</p>
