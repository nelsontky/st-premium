    <p>China’s grow­ing as­sertive­ness in the re­gion, which has shown no signs of abat­ing even dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, may prompt Ja­pan to raise its guard and re-eval­u­ate the re­cent im­prove­ment in ties with its neigh­bour, an­a­lysts here say.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party has urged the gov­ern­ment to scrap a planned state visit by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping – post­poned due to the pan­demic – as Bei­jing tight­ens its ten­ta­cles on Hong Kong with a new se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Dr Ak­i­hiko Tanaka, pres­i­dent of the Na­tional Grad­u­ate In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies, fore­sees Ja­pan at­tempt­ing to de­cou­ple from China were it to keep its hard­line pos­ture.</p>
    <p>While Tokyo is cur­rently “not in a po­si­tion to con­front and be hos­tile to China on all as­pects”, this could trans­late to more di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion in its in­vest­ment and sup­ply chains to re­duce re­liance on China.</p>
    <p>He said: “It would be de­sir­able if democ­ra­cies around the world can strengthen their in­ter­de­pen­dence.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tanaka was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from The Straits Times at a news brief­ing yes­ter­day or­gan­ised by the For­eign Press Cen­tre in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>He said Ja­pan would be­come more wary of China over tech­nol­ogy that might be prone to se­cu­rity breaches and was un­likely to adopt Huawei in its 5G net­works – a move mir­ror­ing those of its ally the United States as well as other part­ners like Aus­tralia and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Tokyo would also re­vise its</p>
    <p>Na­tional De­fence Pro­gramme Guide­lines this year, a move that is on pa­per aimed at plug­ging a de­fence gap over aborted plans to use the Aegis Ashore anti-mis­sile sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Yet, Dr Tanaka said, the re­vi­sion may also con­sider ag­gres­sive acts on the part of China, whose ves­sels have made in­cur­sions into wa­ters around the dis­puted Senkaku/Diaoyu islets in the East China Sea for a record-break­ing 93 straight days as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>An edi­to­rial in the Yomi­uri daily yes­ter­day also called for closer co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the Ja­pan Coast Guard and the Self-De­fence Force to boost Ja­pan’s pre­pared­ness to de­fend its ter­ri­tory, cit­ing the in­te­gra­tion be­tween the Chi­nese Coast Guard and its mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Ja­pan re­served its harsh­est lan­guage for China in its an­nual de­fence White Pa­per, ac­cus­ing Bei­jing of “re­lent­lessly con­tin­u­ing uni­lat­eral at­tempts to change the sta­tus quo by co­er­cion”.</p>
    <p>It also pointed the fin­ger at Bei­jing for us­ing med­i­cal aid to for­eign coun­tries fight­ing Covid-19 as a way to spread dis­in­for­ma­tion and pro­pa­ganda.</p>
    <p>Kobe Univer­sity se­cu­rity ex­pert Tosh Mi­no­hara told The Straits Times that Ja­pan needed to square the di­ver­gence in its se­cu­rity and eco­nomic in­ter­ests with China.</p>
    <p>The White Pa­per, he noted, had made no men­tion of China’s eco­nomic cou­pling with Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>But a strong econ­omy would pro­vide the bud­getary fire­power for a more ro­bust de­fence, he said, adding that Ja­pan could not af­ford to be re­ac­tionary on mat­ters of its own na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Com­pli­cat­ing mat­ters was un­cer­tainty about Amer­i­can com­mit­ment in the re­gion, said Dr Mi­no­hara. “The US has been ve­he­mently against Chi­nese ac­tions and the rhetoric has been get­ting stronger by the day, but this has not equated to com­mit­ment,” he said. “Western coun­tries are ob­serv­ing Un­cle Sam but Un­cle</p>
    <p>Sam is not quite there.”</p>
    <p>Dr Mi­no­hara called for closer eco­nomic and se­cu­rity co­or­di­na­tion among like-minded na­tions, in­clud­ing in the Euro­pean Union and Asean, as well as part­ners like Aus­tralia and In­dia.</p>
    <p>But Dr Tanaka re­mained some­what op­ti­mistic for the fu­ture, say­ing that at­tempts to in­flu­ence the sta­tus quo and cre­ate a fait ac­com­pli would not last.</p>
    <p>“China’s strat­egy to con­trol the in­ter­na­tional or­der is weak­en­ing do­mes­ti­cally. They are suf­fer­ing the mid­dle-in­come trap and their cur­rent ac­count bal­ance is de­clin­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The very as­sertive diplo­matic pos­ture has caused push­back, and the clout of China may not ex­pand. It will not be easy to es­tab­lish an or­der where China alone takes ad­van­tage,” he added, not­ing that Bei­jing, too, would be hit badly by a global re­ces­sion due to Covid-19.</p>
