    <p>’Twas two days post-Christ­mas, and all through our home, ev­ery crea­ture is stir­ring, quar­an­tine no longer con­fin­ing our zone. Pre­dictable sunny skies beam over our heads, yet we dream of a Sin­ga­pore day with a white whis­per of snow­fall in­stead.</p>
    <p>A stroll down Or­chard Road has masks cov­er­ing ev­ery face, as we live in fear of the pan­demic’s rapid pace. Teens dressed for the trop­ics in tank tops and flip flops watch while anx­ious par­ents vent, non-stop, as the fright­ful virus leaves us in a gen­uine ker­fuf­fle, mud­dling up our hol­i­day shuffle.</p>
    <p>I shall spare thee more rhyming, though be­yond doubt, my daugh­ters Happy, 17, and Bee, 12, and I are ec­static to have fin­ished our stay-home-no­tice (SHN) just in time for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>While en­sconced at the Fair­mont Sin­ga­pore ho­tel, smack in the mid­dle of our gar­den city, with a pic­turesque view of the Padang, the Es­planade and the Sin­ga­pore Flyer, I fell asleep on the first night of our en­forced SHN with­out draw­ing the cur­tains, for the mag­i­cal sight of the moon on Ma­rina Bay re­minded me of the unique­ness of this is­land na­tion that my fam­ily has called home for 13-plus years.</p>
    <p>BACK IN THE USA</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can author F. Scott Fitzger­ald wrote of how we re­turn to a place to find noth­ing has changed ex­cept for our mind­sets.</p>
    <p>I re­turned to Sin­ga­pore on Dec 9, af­ter spend­ing just over two weeks with my age­ing par­ents in the United States, with a re­newed ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the lit­tle red dot that is my fam­ily’s cho­sen home.</p>
    <p>For my Amer­ica is not what she was: The grow­ing tol­er­ance of in­tol­er­ance leaves me woe­ful, and the dog­matic re­fusal of count­less peo­ple to live by safe guide­lines that are proven to pro­tect them­selves and oth­ers from the pan­demic re­minds me that with cit­i­zen­ship comes a charge.</p>
    <p>Although my home­land of birth seems to have lost her way, Sin­ga­pore un­der­stands and her peo­ple ap­pre­ci­ate that “we” sur­passes “me”.</p>
    <p>Yes, I adored the au­tum­nal weather of­fer­ing a canopy of golden leaves as Bee and I cy­cled daily, clad in scarves and gloves knit­ted by my grand­mother An­der­son decades ago.</p>
    <p>Rem­i­nisc­ing of childhood to my daugh­ters, I pointed out my ele­men­tary and sec­ondary schools. Bee, about to enter Nanyang Girls’ High in Jan­uary, day­dreamed of what it might be like to at­tend school in my home­town, pop­u­la­tion 50,000, where math­e­mat­ics as taught in Sin­ga­pore schools is def­i­nitely not on the less rig­or­ous cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>To­gether, we baked and dec­o­rated gin­ger­bread cook­ies with my mother, and all of us at­tended Sunday ser­mons at my par­ents’ church.</p>
    <p>Mother, re­cov­er­ing from a hip re­place­ment, watched while we dec­o­rated the Christ­mas tree with or­na­ments, many home­made, dat­ing back to my youth. Our evenings con­cluded with a pre­dictable though up­lift­ing Hall­mark movie, since we rarely ven­tured from home, save for church and bi­cy­cle rides, for fear of Covid in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>When we did visit a shop and the gro­cery store, I found so­lace in signs man­dat­ing masks for en­try, though plenty of my fel­low Amer­i­cans de­cided to pay these no heed – “their rights af­fected” if they were to join the wise masses cov­er­ing their faces to pro­tect them­selves and oth­ers. We ex­pe­ri­enced no con­tact trac­ing, nor tem­per­a­ture checks at any point dur­ing our visit to the US.</p>
    <p>Life in Amer­ica felt like a des­per­ate run-on sen­tence yearn­ing for a full stop, in or­der to fight the deadly virus which has in­fected over 18 mil­lion peo­ple, while killing new highs daily.</p>
    <p>Yes, the mask does of­fer an air of mys­tery and it can be un­com­fort­able, but with­out the cov­er­ing, there is an un­rav­el­ling of safety al­low­ing the virus to pre­vail.</p>
    <p>This pan­demic has re­minded us, no mat­ter how in­de­pen­dent and suc­cess­ful we might be, that we all are at the mercy of sci­ence.</p>
    <p>In­stead of the sense of free­dom most of us as­so­ciate with travel, I felt the heavy weight of the nasty plague’s reach upon my ev­ery action and breath.</p>
    <p>Hence, I had no qualms com­ing home and serv­ing SHN in a govern­ment-ap­proved ho­tel. In fact, the re­quire­ment, though per­haps a bit ex­ces­sive, felt re­as­sur­ing. The 14 days with my daugh­ters saw friends send­ing us too many de­li­cious treats and sen­si­ble gifts, like jump­ing ropes, and we ex­er­cised daily, played board games, at­tended on­line classes and we­bi­nars, re­viewed univer­sity ap­pli­ca­tions for Happy, and cre­ated some TikToks.</p>
    <p>A sav­ing grace of SHN had to be the ho­tel’s end­less sup­ply of cof­fee pods for the Ne­spresso ma­chine, daily laun­dry ser­vice, and the out­stand­ing view, al­low­ing me to watch life un­fold be­low.</p>
    <p>Lest our SHN sound too ideal, the Covid-19 swab test, on day 11, was most un­pleas­ant. Tak­ing less than 30 sec­onds, with the in­ser­tion of a long, thin stick into each nos­tril for a slow 10-sec­ond hold, both Happy and I found it worse than we had ex­pected.</p>
    <p>In the mo­ment, it was ter­ri­ble, but per­haps the psy­cho­log­i­cal dis­com­fort weighed heav­ier than the phys­i­cal pain.</p>
    <p>We thought Bee would not have to take the swab test be­cause of her age, but I was called a day be­fore the end of SHN and alerted that some­one near us on our flight had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. This meant we were no longer un­der SHN, but now of­fi­cially un­der Quar­an­tine Or­der, even though Happy and I had tested negative.</p>
    <p>On day 13, the day be­fore we were to end our quar­an­tine, Cer­tis of­fi­cers drove us to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal for Bee’s swab test, and then es­corted us to Siloso Beach Re­sort. We spent the fi­nal night of quar­an­tine in a room with three beds, miss­ing that Ma­rina Bay view. Thank good­ness, Bee’s test re­sult came back negative.</p>
    <p>GRAT­I­TUDE AND HOPE</p>
    <p>De­spite the pro­longed SHN, I am grate­ful to live in a coun­try where peo­ple re­spect the rule of law and where the Govern­ment’s in­ten­tions to keep peo­ple se­cure over­rides naysay­ers.</p>
    <p>To know we have a sys­tem in place and lead­er­ship to keep us safe – and more vi­brant than per­haps any other coun­try in the world at this mo­ment – al­lows cit­i­zens and res­i­dents of Sin­ga­pore to have faith in our fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, the end of 2020 sees no one look­ing for splen­dour or glitz to mark the oc­ca­sion, es­pe­cially not when the world is gen­uinely sick.</p>
    <p>In­stead, this hol­i­day sea­son is all about that afore­men­tioned faith, which al­lows hope to pre­vail: hope for to­mor­row’s start of phase 3, for busi­nesses to find a way for­ward to thrive, and of course, hope in a safe and ac­ces­si­ble vac­cine in the new year.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vi­sions of sugar plum fairies dancing in our heads are to­day re­placed by im­ages of days when masks will be tossed aside in­stead.</p>
    <p>Per­haps this pan­demic year has not been the much-touted waste­land. We have been re­minded of what is gen­uinely wor­thy – fam­ily, re­la­tion­ships, true friends, com­mu­nity, and even the bal­ance be­tween work and leisure. This les­son, gained through our con­fine­ment and iso­la­tion, of­fers us a fresh un­der­stand­ing of life’s breadth, our rel­e­vance, and sig­nif­i­cance.</p>
    <p>Our post-pan­demic world, though far away, could well be better than be­fore, if we main­tain and keep only that which is most important, all the while con­tin­u­ing to em­brace</p>
    <p>“we” over “me”.</p>
