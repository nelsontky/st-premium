    <p>The world’s largest dam is un­der pres­sure in the mas­sive flood­ing that is wip­ing away bil­lions of dol­lars of value in China. The predica­ment sym­bol­ises a loom­ing cri­sis for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate change is bring­ing more fre­quent and in­tense del­uges that threaten the economic heart­land, and in­fra­struc­ture de­fences in­stalled with the dis­as­ters of pre­vi­ous eras in mind can­not keep up.</p>
    <p>There is very lit­tle time to pre­pare for what is com­ing. The prob­lem is not that China lacks wa­ter man­age­ment projects. It has built hun­dreds of thou­sands of lev­ees, dikes, reser­voirs and dams on its seven ma­jor river sys­tems. But many are strug­gling to cope with months of rain-fed flood­ing that has rav­aged vast swathes of in­dus­trial and agri­cul­tural land and en­gulfed mil­lions of homes.</p>
    <p>This past week, of­fi­cials feared that the Three Gorges Dam on the mighty Yangtze was peak­ing and could over­flow. Else­where, the au­thor­i­ties have blown up bar­ri­ers that were caus­ing more dam­age than they were help­ing.</p>
    <p>China has ex­pe­ri­enced three of the world’s 10 most dev­as­tat­ing floods since 1950. The limited num­ber of deaths this time is a tes­ta­ment to how far the coun­try has come, with of­fi­cials say­ing at least 219 peo­ple have died or dis­ap­peared. Yet flood­ing in cities is get­ting worse, a sign of ris­ing pop­u­la­tions and fail­ure to ex­e­cute ur­ban­i­sa­tion poli­cies.</p>
    <p>An­nual av­er­age losses from river in­un­da­tions are the high­est in the world. Flood pol­icy has not been made the priority it should be, given the high stakes.</p>
    <p>The Yangtze River Economic Belt is home to more than 40 per cent of China’s pop­u­la­tion</p>
    <p>(about 600 mil­lion peo­ple) and ac­counts for al­most 50 per cent of ex­port value and 45 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, ac­cord­ing to China Wa­ter Risk. On its own, the re­gion could be the third-largest econ­omy in the world.</p>
    <p>More se­vere dis­as­ters are an­tic­i­pated. Hy­dro­cli­ma­tol­o­gist Peter Gle­ick, a mem­ber of the United States’ Na­tional Academy of Sci­ences, told the South China Morn­ing Post that cli­mate change is in­creas­ing the risks of ex­treme rain­fall events, mak­ing it “even more likely that dams like the Three Gorges will be un­able to pre­vent the worst flood­ing from oc­cur­ring in the fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>A study has found that if tem­per­a­tures rise by</p>
    <p>2 deg C, flows around the Yangtze and other ma­jor world rivers will in­ten­sify, in­creas­ing the fre­quency of huge floods.</p>
    <p>Heavy-rain days are al­ready more nu­mer­ous and in­tense in­side cities com­pared with sub­ur­ban ar­eas along the Yangtze, a study us­ing rain­fall records over two pe­ri­ods be­tween 1961 and 2010 found.</p>
    <p>Such days in­crease by 30 per cent on av­er­age in places like Suzhou, near Shang­hai, known for wed­ding gowns and bri­dal ex­ports along with big tech­nol­ogy fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>China is not shy about de­ploy­ing money.</p>
    <p>Last year, 726 bil­lion yuan (S$144 bil­lion) was shov­elled into wa­ter con­ser­vancy con­struc­tion – the high­est in history, ac­cord­ing to CLSA Se­cu­ri­ties. Flood man­age­ment has re­ceived 1.2 bil­lion yuan in cen­tral gov­ern­ment funds since the be­gin­ning of the rainy sea­son.</p>
    <p>But there is com­pe­ti­tion. Tril­lions of yuan are be­ing spent to sup­port a na­tional recovery from Covid-19, in­clud­ing build­ing mas­sive 5G ca­pac­ity to en­sure fu­ture man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties. That is cer­tainly jus­ti­fi­able. Roads to nowhere aren’t.</p>
    <p>Past dis­as­ters tend to frame think­ing about fu­ture ones. Yet threats are not static – cli­mate change is speed­ing up the sever­ity of flood­ing. Risk as­sess­ments need to fac­tor in where China’s wealth is be­ing built.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, quan­tifi­able flood losses in heav­ily in­dus­tri­alised Guang­dong prov­ince in 2015 reached around 30 bil­lion yuan, but dis­rup­tion to its con­cen­tra­tion of roads and rail­ways, ports and air­ports pushed costs far higher. The cities of south­ern China are at great jeop­ardy.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple of how mit­i­ga­tion ef­forts are be­ing out­paced is the strat­egy of di­ver­sion zones adopted two decades ago, set­ting aside ar­eas where the au­thor­i­ties re­leased wa­ter to con­trol ex­ces­sive flow.</p>
    <p>Re­set­tled peo­ple have since been driven fur­ther away from zones where they were sup­posed to live as ever larger amounts of wa­ter need to be un­leashed. Even­tu­ally, they end up on lands that are not el­i­gi­ble for com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s min­istries have is­sued streams of cli­mate change-re­lated rules and tar­gets, and China was at one point con­sid­ered a leader.</p>
    <p>This was sup­posed to be the year that com­pa­nies got bet­ter about en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial gov­er­nance dis­clo­sures. Con­strained cof­fers, the vi­ral out­break, trade war with the US, and slow­ing economic growth will make it harder to put fu­ture floods and the like front of mind. This needs a re­think.</p>
    <p>Con­sider this knock-on ef­fect. In the­ory, banks will likely take losses be­cause of nat­u­ral dis­as­ters; their clients will pass them along to in­sur­ers. In China, in­sur­ance com­pa­nies are not well pre­pared; statis­tics re­main sparse and risk-mod­el­ling around flood events has be­come more dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>In 2016, China’s non-life in­sur­ers were hit with losses of more than 4 bil­lion yuan re­lated to floods and storms be­tween June and Au­gust. This time, Fitch Rat­ings an­a­lysts expect claims “to con­tinue to surge as the rainy sea­son is not over yet in cer­tain parts of China”.</p>
    <p>They noted on July 15 that in­sur­ers in Hubei, Guangxi and Jiangxi prov­inces had re­ported ag­gre­gate in­curred losses of more than 500 mil­lion yuan as at a week ear­lier, in­clud­ing claims from mo­tor, agri­cul­tural and prop­erty in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>The last thing China’s bur­dened, state-run fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions need are con­tin­ued nat­u­ral dis­as­ters. As tough as this year has been, it may be time to re-cal­i­brate pri­or­i­ties. Build­ing 5G base sta­tions and rail lines will not mat­ter if they get wiped out by floods again and again.</p>
