    <p>The corner­stone of peace in our times is the mod­ern na­tion state that re­spects the sovereignt­y of its neigh­bours and up­holds the sanc­tity of bor­ders that sep­a­rate them. China’s ex­tra­or­di­nary as­cent over the last four decades, from the 1970s when paramount leader Deng Xiaop­ing set it on the path of eco­nomic re­forms to its grow­ing geostrate­gic am­bi­tions un­der Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, is test­ing this con­cept of sovereignt­y that arose in 17th-cen­tury Europe and has been through the ex­pe­ri­ence of two world wars and the Cold War. China’s as­sertive­ness at its bor­ders has been strik­ing – from its ter­ri­to­rial claims in the South China Sea which led to com­plaints about acts of ag­gres­sion, like the sink­ing of a Viet­namese ves­sel in dis­puted wa­ters in April, to Chi­nese ves­sels fish­ing and en­croach­ing into the ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zones of other states, to deadly clashes in the Hi­malayas with In­dia, as well as an in­creased Chi­nese mil­i­tary pres­ence around is­lands in the East China Sea which Ja­pan con­trols but China claims as its own.</p>
    <p>This could well be the face of a new, mus­cu­lar for­eign pol­icy that some see as com­men­su­rate with China’s el­e­vated sta­tus. Or it could be a de­par­ture that has seeds in the frailty of the cur­rent times when much of the world has its hands full with Covid-19, al­low­ing Bei­jing lever­age to push its claims and in­voke na­tion­al­ism, in part to chan­nel dis­con­tent aris­ing from its own ini­tial mis­man­age­ment of the virus and eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties.</p>
    <p>The most dan­ger­ous sovereignt­y con­test is that be­tween China and In­dia, Asia’s two largest pop­u­la­tions, both nu­clear-armed. Their clash in June left 20 In­dian sol­diers dead, and an un­known num­ber of Chi­nese troops killed or in­jured. Each coun­try has ex­tended de­ploy­ments since then, plac­ing tens of thou­sands of troops eye­ball-to-eye­ball along their bor­der. They have ac­cused each other of il­le­gal and provoca­tive ac­tions and de­manded that the other rein in its troops. High­pro­file sum­mits that de­fined their re­la­tion­ship a year ago have given way to a clam­p­down that saw In­dia re­strict Chi­nese in­vest­ments and ban Chi­nese apps. In their first high-level en­gage­ment af­ter the June clashes, Chi­nese and In­dian de­fence min­is­ters met in Moscow last Fri­day. This week, their for­eign min­is­ters may do like­wise.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing down troops and con­fi­dence-build­ing mea­sures would be a good start to de­fus­ing ten­sions. A last­ing so­lu­tion, how­ever, can only come from de­mar­cat­ing what is the world’s long­est un­marked bor­der. In­dia’s ear­lier sug­ges­tions that both sides trade maps pre­sent­ing their un­der­stand­ing of the bor­der has not been taken up by China which may find strate­gic am­bi­gu­ity ad­van­ta­geous. Pa­tience and cau­tion that trans­form into trust is the only vi­able way to tackle vexed sovereignt­y is­sues. Both Asian giants surely have enough cre­ativ­ity and dy­namism to achieve that.</p>
