    <p>When one of my favourite baris­tas, Ms Court­ney Kheng, mes­sages me on so­cial me­dia about her new gig at the re­cently-opened Noa Cof­fee, I de­cide I have to visit.</p>
    <p>A cou­ple of weeks be­fore I do, I check out a new bar,</p>
    <p>Laut, with friends. Well, it turns out that Noa and Laut share the same premises in Stan­ley Street.</p>
    <p>Noa op­er­ates in the day and Laut, which means “sea” in Malay, takes over at night. I’ve been to both sev­eral times and love the fo­cus on South-east Asian in­gre­di­ents, whether it is in the food or the cock­tails and drinks.</p>
    <p>Ms Kheng makes ex­cel­lent kom­bucha. I drank litres of it when she worked at Apart­ment in Laven­der Street.</p>
    <p>At Noa, which means “wa­ter” in Laos, she is ex­per­i­ment­ing with fruit kom­bucha, made with­out tea, and af­ter con­di­tion­ing the scoby to work in fruit juice.</p>
    <p>The guava kom­bucha ($8) is lightly tangy and the flavour of the fruit comes through very clearly.</p>
    <p>There is also usu­ally a soda ($8) on the menu and the rambu­tan and lon­gan ones I have tried are win­ners.</p>
    <p>The food is just as good as Laut’s of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>If it’s still on the menu, go for the Squid Adobo ($12 a la carte, $15 for the set). Squid needs to be cooked quickly or for a long time, or it turns rub­bery.</p>
    <p>At Noa, it is cooked fast and stays ten­der in a pi­quant sauce that is very mor­eish. Get the set. It comes with rice coloured blue with but­ter­fly pea flower and topped with shred­ded Thai basil, kaf­fir lime, co­rian­der and turmeric leaves.</p>
    <p>The achar on the side has a faint boozy vibe from be­ing fer­mented. The sam­bal bela­can is a lit­tle muted, but the adobo sauce and pick­les make up for it.</p>
    <p>One thing I hope re­mains on the menu is Tauhu Gado Salad ($8), be­cause the hot cubes of tofu are crisp on the out­side and molten in­side. Cubes of tem­peh and rice cakes, and soya bean sprouts in warm peanut sauce make this an ir­re­sistible starter.</p>
    <p>For dessert, or­der Tart Li­mau ($8, right), with cala­mansi curd and palm sugar in a pas­try cup that looks rough hewn but is re­ally light and ten­der. There is proper zing in the curd.</p>
    <p>WHERE: Noa Cof­fee, 17 Stan­ley Street MRT: Telok Ayer TEL: 8878-8018 OPEN: 8.30am to 4pm (Mon­day to Satur­day), closed on Sun­day</p>
