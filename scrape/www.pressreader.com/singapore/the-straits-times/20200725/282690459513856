    <p>The Citroen Grand C4 SpaceToure­r feels like it has been around in Sin­ga­pore for a long time. The last time The Straits Times re­viewed the car was five years ago, in July 2015.</p>
    <p>The multi-pur­pose ve­hi­cle (MPV) was launched here in April 2014 with two 1.6-litre tur­bocharged power plants – a diesel and petrol en­gine. It won drivers over with its mod­ern styling, fu­tur­is­tic cabin and clever use of space.</p>
    <p>Its 2,840mm wheel­base is still the long­est among com­pact MPVs, which in­clude ri­vals such as the Toy­ota Prius+, Re­nault Grand Scenic and Volk­swa­gen Touran.</p>
    <p>The car has re­ceived sev­eral up­grades along the way. The robo­tised man­ual gear­box was re­placed with a six-speed au­to­matic in 2015.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, when the MPV was re­named the Grand C4 SpaceToure­r, the im­prove­ments in­cluded hands-free tail­gate and a more re­spon­sive seven-inch in­fo­tain­ment touch­screen which is com­pat­i­ble with Ap­ple and An­droid phones.</p>
    <p>The 1.2-litre en­gine also made its de­but, but was mated with a sixspeed au­to­matic gear­box, which is now an eight-speeder.</p>
    <p>The car’s de­sign has aged well af­ter six years. The D-pil­lars, which ex­tend from the A-pil­lars and the roof like a boomerang, are still eye­catch­ing.</p>
    <p>But in the cabin, some signs of age are show­ing. For ex­am­ple, the touch­screen dis­play ap­pears diminu­tive when nine-inch units are com­mon these days.</p>
    <p>And while the slim steer­ing­mounted gear lever was a con­ver­sa­tion piece six years ago, it looks dated now com­pared with the joy­stick gear lever in the mod­ern cock­pit of the C5 Air­cross, its sta­ble­mate.</p>
    <p>The SpaceToure­r, how­ever, has a unique fea­ture not found in any of its ri­vals that will win over any driver – both the driver and front pas­sen­ger seats come with built-in back mas­sage func­tions.</p>
    <p>This fea­ture is un­heard of in cars in the $110,000 price seg­ment.</p>
    <p>On the move, the SpaceToure­r has a leisurely gait con­sis­tent with the un­hur­ried na­ture that MPVs are usu­ally meant to be driven in.</p>
    <p>Over a two-day, 112km test-drive, I am able to achieve the of­fi­cial fuel con­sump­tion of about 5 litres/ 100km with a light foot, but the fig­ure soars to about 8 or 9 litres/ 100km with spir­ited driv­ing.</p>
    <p>The SpaceToure­r has an er­gonomic quirk. I am caught with­out a CashCard when ex­it­ing a carpark and am un­able to reach the in-car unit from my seat. I have to shift the gear to park mode, en­gage the park­ing brake, un­buckle the seat belt, lift my bum off the seat and lunge for­ward to slot in the card – a de­lay which must have drawn dis­ap­prov­ing stares from the line of drivers be­hind.</p>
    <p>This quirk aside, the SpaceToure­r stands out by be­ing cheaper than the VW Touran and Toy­ota Prius+.</p>
    <p>It should be among the top picks for those look­ing for an at­trac­tive, spa­cious, well-equipped and rea­son­ably priced seven-seater MPV.</p>
    <p>In any case, the back mas­sage func­tion ought to press all the right spots.</p>
