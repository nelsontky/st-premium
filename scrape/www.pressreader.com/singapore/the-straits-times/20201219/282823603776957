    <p>A pro­fes­sor who helped lay the ground­work for re­search into in­fec­tious dis­eases in Sin­ga­pore was yes­ter­day hon­oured for his ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ranga Kr­ish­nan, 64, re­ceived a medal un­der the Pres­i­dent’s Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Awards – the high­est recog­ni­tion for ex­cep­tional re­search sci­en­tists and en­gi­neers here – from Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob at the Is­tana.</p>
    <p>Prof Ranga, who is now chair­man of the Health Min­istry’s Na­tional Med­i­cal Re­search Coun­cil, had helped es­tab­lish the emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School when he was dean from 2008 to 2015.</p>
    <p>One of the school’s five sig­na­ture pro­grammes, it has since yielded many break­throughs dur­ing var­i­ous out­breaks of in­fec­tious dis­eases, in­clud­ing the cur­rent Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, re­searchers there have de­vel­oped di­ag­nos­tic test kits, treat­ments and even a vac­cine to help the coun­try tackle the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>“We knew that viruses will cross from an­i­mals to hu­mans and this was par­tic­u­larly a threat for our re­gion and could have a ma­jor im­pact on the health and econ­omy,” Prof Ranga told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“We were then lucky in be­ing able to at­tract the best in this field, such as Dr Wang Linfa whose work on bat viruses, along with build­ing the fa­cil­i­ties, turned out to be pre­scient in many ways.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ranga also con­trib­uted to the de­vel­op­ment of the health and bio­med­i­cal sciences sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore in other ways. He had helped to pro­mote the trans­la­tion of fun­da­men­tal re­search into ben­e­fi­cial ap­pli­ca­tions by strength­en­ing part­ner­ships be­tween health­care and re­search in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Prof Ranga said he was hon­oured, hum­bled and sur­prised to be se­lected for the award.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Awards com­prise the Pres­i­dent’s Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Medal, the Pres­i­dent’s Sci­ence Award, and the Pres­i­dent’s Tech­nol­ogy Award.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah pre­sented the Pres­i­dent’s Sci­ence Award to the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s (A*Star) Pro­fes­sor Liu Jian­jun, 57, and a trio from the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity com­pris­ing Pro­fes­sor Niko­lay Zhe­ludev, 65, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chong Yi­dong, 40, and As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Zhang Baile, 39.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s Tech­nol­ogy Award went to Pro­fes­sor Dario Cam­pana from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The win­ners were picked by a panel of rep­re­sen­ta­tives from industry, academia and re­search.</p>
    <p>They hail from fields like ge­netic stud­ies, im­munol­ogy and nanopho­ton­ics (the study of light on a nano scale), and were recog­nised for their con­tri­bu­tions in mak­ing Sin­ga­pore a world-class hub for sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy, said A*Star.</p>
    <p>Three Young Sci­en­tist Awards were also given out by Min­is­ter for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing dur­ing the event.</p>
    <p>Re­cip­i­ents in­clude A*Star’s Dr Chew Wei Leong, 35, for his work in gene edit­ing therapy; NUS’ Dr John Ho, 31, for his re­search in de­vel­op­ing wire­less health­care tech­nolo­gies; and Dr Tan Si Hui, 35, for her re­search on can­cer and stem cells. She was for­merly with A*Star till late this year and is now with Car­gene Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan con­grat­u­lated the win­ners of the Pres­i­dent’s Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy and Young Sci­en­tist awards, say­ing the sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy com­mu­nity help make the im­pos­si­ble hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“You’re the ones who al­low us to com­pete on the ba­sis of in­no­va­tion, the qual­ity of our ideas, the qual­ity of our prod­ucts, and not com­pete on the ba­sis of our size or re­source en­dow­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of your con­tri­bu­tion to our coun­try, we can not only man­age the cur­rent Covid-19 pan­demic... but more im­por­tantly, you have al­lowed us to es­tab­lish the foun­da­tions for the suc­cess of our fu­ture econ­omy.”</p>
