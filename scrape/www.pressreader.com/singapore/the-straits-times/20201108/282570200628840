    <p>They take a swipe at many Sin­ga­pore­ans’ most ex­pen­sive as­sets – their Hous­ing Board (HDB) flats – and say that these units will have zero value after 99 years.</p>
    <p>Us­ing this scare tac­tic, these “in­vest­ment gu­rus” then prom­ise to teach peo­ple how to pro­tect their wealth via prop­erty in­vest­ments – after they pay for a course.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, par­tic­i­pants will be taught how to in­vest in com­mer­cial and pri­vate prop­er­ties – both of which will also be of zero value be­tween 60 and 99 years.</p>
    <p>So, be­fore you get taken for a ride by such du­bi­ous ex­perts, here are some facts on why HDB flats are still most fam­i­lies’ best in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>SIM­I­LAR TENURES TO MOST NEW PRI­VATE PROP­ER­TIES</p>
    <p>Since 1967, all new sites for pri­vate homes are also given leases of up to 99 years.</p>
    <p>HDB flats are there­fore no dif­fer­ent from most con­do­mini­ums here in terms of ten­ure.</p>
    <p>In land-scarce Sin­ga­pore, it is not prac­ti­cal to build HDB flats that can be owned for­ever. Not only will their val­ues sky­rocket, but fu­ture gen­er­a­tions may end up be­ing driven out to sea, lit­er­ally, when there is no land left for new homes.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, the prop­erty di­vide will be huge. Those who can af­ford it will con­tinue to keep such prop­er­ties for gen­er­a­tions, al­ways de­priv­ing those who need af­ford­able homes of the chance to own one.</p>
    <p>Yes, the Gov­ern­ment can ex­er­cise land ac­qui­si­tion laws to take back old and de­crepit free­hold flats, but these will then have to be paid for at mar­ket rates – can fu­ture HDB buy­ers spend mil­lions of dol­lars to pay for their flats?</p>
    <p>UN­USU­ALLY LOW PRICE FOR SIN­GA­PORE­ANS</p>
    <p>Say what you will, but only in Sin­ga­pore can you buy a brand-new four-room HDB flat in a ma­ture es­tate such as Toa Payoh for about $350,000 when a sim­i­larly sized con­do­minium unit nearby may cost four or five times more.</p>
    <p>Ask any Hong Kong res­i­dent and they will prob­a­bly tell you how they wish they had sim­i­lar homes built for them – most apart­ments there are not only more ex­pen­sive than sim­i­lar con­do­minium units here, but also smaller.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who are 55 years old and above can even ap­ply for two-room flexi flats. While the flats have shorter leases from be­tween 15 and 45 years, they are priced much lower, from as low as $10,000 with grants.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has said many times in his Na­tional Day Rally speeches that the price of HDB flats will al­ways be kept af­ford­able so that the max­i­mum num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans can have homes they can call their own.</p>
    <p>Ow­ing to such a non-mar­ket pric­ing ap­proach, all Sin­ga­pore­ans who bought their flats di­rectly from the HDB will al­most cer­tainly get a wind­fall when they sell their flats in the re­sale mar­ket.</p>
    <p>TWO BITES OF THE CHERRY</p>
    <p>Those who be­moan the 99-year lease of HDB flats for­get one im­por­tant fact: All Sin­ga­pore­ans are el­i­gi­ble to ap­ply for new flats twice.</p>
    <p>If you bought your flat early at 25 and lived there for 30 years, you can still buy an­other new flat and restart your 99-year lease at the age of 55. Chances are, you will still make some money from your old flat after pay­ing for the new one.</p>
    <p>Even if you have an ex­traor­di­nar­ily long life and out­live your HDB leases, you do not have to worry that you have no flat to pass to your de­scen­dants – they can ap­ply for the flats them­selves, twice.</p>
    <p>AF­FORD­ABLE MAIN­TE­NANCE FEES</p>
    <p>Again, only in Sin­ga­pore can own­ers of HDB flats en­joy a clean and well-main­tained en­vi­ron­ment to live in with­out hav­ing to pay a lot to main­tain it.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the size of the flats, monthly con­ser­vancy charges are usu­ally be­tween $20 and $100.</p>
    <p>The best part is that when­ever times are bad, many house­holds get waivers for even these fees for a few months, es­pe­cially those who live in smaller flats.</p>
    <p>They also do not have to worry when it comes to the re­place­ment of big-ticket items such as lifts. For own­ers of con­do­minium units, each house­hold has to share and pay for ex­pen­di­tures for the up­keep of the es­tate and con­trib­ute to a “sink­ing fund” for up­grad­ing pur­poses.</p>
    <p>This is why con­do­minium unit own­ers can pay any­thing from about $300 to $2,000 a month for big units.</p>
    <p>HAVE A HOME AND CASH</p>
    <p>You have prob­a­bly heard of cases in­volv­ing own­ers of some landed homes who com­plain that they do not have suf­fi­cient cash at old age.</p>
    <p>While they can sell their home, this is usu­ally eas­ier said than done.</p>
    <p>In a down­turn, it is not easy to sell one’s home with­out pos­si­bly in­cur­ring huge losses. Even if you can do so, you have to up­root your­self and start life at a new home – some­thing that some se­niors do not en­joy do­ing.</p>
    <p>For own­ers of HDB flats, se­niors who are short on cash can opt to sell part of their lease back to the HDB with­out need­ing to sell or move out of their homes.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, this is why the Sin­ga­pore dream for many new­ly­weds al­ways starts with HDB flats. For those who do well, the next phase of the dream is called “up­grad­ing”.</p>
    <p>So, never be­lit­tle the value of your HDB flat, as it has paved the way for a smoother life jour­ney for more Sin­ga­pore­ans than it has been given credit for.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Peo&#xAD;ple view&#xAD;ing mod&#xAD;els of HDB es&#xAD;tates at HDB Hub last month. The value of HDB flats should not be un&#xAD;der&#xAD;es&#xAD;ti&#xAD;mated as they have paved the way for a smoother life jour&#xAD;ney for more Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore&#xAD;ans than they have been given credit for, says the writer. Such flats are still the best in&#xAD;vest&#xAD;ment for most fam&#xAD;i&#xAD;lies as they are, among other things, no dif&#xAD;fer&#xAD;ent from most con&#xAD;do&#xAD;mini&#xAD;ums here in terms of ten&#xAD;ure, and are of an un&#xAD;usu&#xAD;ally low price for Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore&#xAD;ans.</p>
