    <p>A frozen meat com­pany in Jo­hor said to be linked to a syn­di­cate which is be­ing probed for al­legedly im­port­ing frozen meat and pass­ing it off as ha­lal will be charged in court to­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 13 po­lice re­ports have been lodged over the syn­di­cate, which used fake ha­lal la­bels, Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion De­part­ment di­rec­tor Huzir Mo­hamed said.</p>
    <p>“We are in­ves­ti­gat­ing un­der... the Pe­nal Code for caus­ing pub­lic fear and alarm,” he said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The syn­di­cate has “dis­rupted pub­lic or­der... and tar­nished the na­tion’s im­age as a ha­lal hub”.</p>
    <p>Malaysians were shaken last week by re­ports that a fake ha­lal meat syn­di­cate has pur­port­edly been op­er­at­ing for 40 years by brib­ing of­fi­cers with money and sex to allow non-certified meat, in­clud­ing po­ten­tially dis­eased kan­ga­roo and horse meat, to be smug­gled in and sold as certified ha­lal beef.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that the il­le­gal ac­tiv­ity in­volved a wide net­work with lo­cal and for­eign syn­di­cates, said Datuk Huzir.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at this mat­ter se­ri­ously and we are com­mit­ted to curb­ing this ac­tiv­ity by co­op­er­a­tion with var­i­ous agen­cies in­clud­ing the Do­mes­tic Trade and Con­sumer Af­fairs Min­istry and the Cus­toms De­part­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>The is­sue came to light after re­ports ear­lier this month that the author­i­ties had busted a com­pany that had been im­port­ing meat from Ar­gentina, Brazil, China and Ukraine and repack­ag­ing it with fake ha­lal la­bels.</p>
    <p>Some 1,500 tonnes of frozen meat worth RM30 mil­lion (S$9.8 mil­lion), fake la­bels and rub­ber stamps were seized dur­ing the raid at a ware­house in Se­nai, Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic Trade and Con­sumer Af­fairs Deputy Min­is­ter Rosol Wahid told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day that the meat had been tested.</p>
    <p>“The find­ings from the De­part­ment of Chem­istry Malaysia show that it was not horse meat, not kan­ga­roo meat and not pork,” he said, adding: “It’s not true that the ac­tiv­ity has been go­ing on for al­most 40 years be­cause the min­istry’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion re­vealed that the com­pany in­volved was reg­is­tered in 2014 and ob­tained the li­cence to im­port frozen prod­ucts in 2017.”</p>
    <p>He added that the frozen meat com­pany in Jo­hor said to be linked to the syn­di­cate would be charged in court to­day. Re­ports said it is fac­ing ac­tion for us­ing fake ha­lal lo­gos on its ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The meat is­sue has alarmed many Malaysians, with some quar­ters call­ing for a Royal Com­mis­sion of In­quiry, and for the coun­try to ex­pand its cat­tle in­dus­try and re­duce de­pen­dency on im­ports.</p>
    <p>Some politi­cians have also voiced con­cern that the fi­asco calls into ques­tion the in­tegrity of Malaysia’s ha­lal in­dus­try and cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic De­vel­op­ment De­part­ment of Malaysia (Jakim) re­sponded last week to the news by say­ing it would tighten en­force­ment and its pro­ce­dures for ha­lal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion for im­ported goods but yes­ter­day said that it was not in­volved in the in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Its re­search divi­sion di­rec­tor Si­ra­jud­din Suhaimee, who was pre­vi­ously Jakim’s ha­lal hub di­rec­tor, said that 300 agen­cies were in­volved in the process of ac­quir­ing and ver­i­fy­ing ha­lal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“Jakim’s main role is to en­sure over­seas slaugh­ter­houses meet the cri­te­ria that we had pre­pared in ac­cor­dance with pro­to­cols and pro­ce­dures,” he said.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim yes­ter­day crit­i­cised Jakim for fail­ing to take an ac­tive role in the probe and said it should not shift the blame to other gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>“This is a ha­lal is­sue, not an is­sue un­der the Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture... the one that is­sues the ha­lal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion is Jakim so there must be a col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity,” he said.</p>
