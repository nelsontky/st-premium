    <p>OSLO • Res­cue work­ers have un­cov­ered a fifth body four days af­ter a landslide buried homes near Nor­way’s cap­i­tal, po­lice said yes­ter­day, as the search goes on for five peo­ple still missing.</p>
    <p>The tragedy oc­curred i n the early hours of last Wednesday, de­stroy­ing and shift­ing houses hun­dreds of me­tres un­der a tor­rent of mud in the vil­lage of Ask, lo­cated 25km north-east of Oslo.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing hard in the de­pres­sion cre­ated by the landslide,” Mr Go­ran Sy­versen, head of the res­cue op­er­a­tion, told a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We have five teams work­ing at the same time. They are do­ing very dif­fi­cult work which is not without risk. Nev­er­the­less, we are mak­ing good progress.”</p>
    <p>Po­lice said ear­lier that a fifth body had been found just be­fore 6am yes­ter­day. That fol­lows three dis­cov­ered last Fri­day and one on Satur­day at the site.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, po­lice iden­ti­fied the body of the first per­son found last Fri­day as 31-year-old Eirik Gronolen. The iden­ti­ties of the four other vic­tims have not been re­leased.</p>
    <p>But po­lice have pub­lished the names of all eight adults, as well as a two-year-old and a 13-year-old, who went missing last Wednesday.</p>
    <p>Ten peo­ple were also in­jured in the landslide, in­clud­ing one se­ri­ously, who was trans­ferred to Oslo for treat­ment.</p>
    <p>About 1,000 res­i­dents – out of a lo­cal pop­u­la­tion of 5,000 – have been evac­u­ated be­cause of fears over the safety of their homes as the ground be­neath con­tin­ues to move.</p>
    <p>“We are at a ho­tel,” one of the evac­uees, Mr Olav Gjerdin­gen, told Agence France-Presse. “It is a com­pletely sur­real and ter­ri­ble sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Search-and-res­cue teams have been us­ing snif­fer dogs, heli­copters and drones to look for survivors.</p>
    <p>“We are search­ing where we be­lieve we might still find survivors,” said Mr Kenneth Wan­gen, the head of the team of fire­fight­ers, adding that the search zone had been ex­panded.</p>
    <p>The teams, who are also seek­ing to res­cue fam­ily pets, were dig­ging chan­nels in the ground to evac­u­ate ca­su­al­ties. The au­thor­i­ties have banned all air­craft from the dis­as­ter area un­til 3pm to­day as they con­duct aerial searches.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, res­cuers re­ceived a visit from King Har­ald, his wife Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon, who lit can­dles for the vic­tims in the church of Gjer­drum.</p>
    <p>“This ter­ri­ble event im­pacts us all. I sym­pa­thise with you who are be­gin­ning the new year with sad­ness and un­cer­tainty,” the King said in tele­vised state­ment.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian Wa­ter Re­sources and En­ergy Direc­torate said the dis­as­ter was a “quick-clay slide” of ap­prox­i­mately 300m by 800m. Quick clay is a type of clay found in Nor­way and Swe­den that can col­lapse and turn into fluid when over­stressed.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Erna Sol­berg de­scribed it as one of the big­gest land­slides the coun­try had ever ex­pe­ri­enced.</p>
