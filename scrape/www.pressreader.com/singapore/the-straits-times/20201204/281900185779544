    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan may ban sales of new petrol-en­gine cars by the mid-2030s in favour of hy­brid or elec­tric ve­hi­cles, pub­lic broad­caster NHK re­ported yes­ter­day, align­ing it with other coun­tries and re­gions that are i mpos­ing curbs on fos­sil fuel ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The move would fol­low Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s pledge in Oc­to­ber for Ja­pan to slash car­bon emis­sions to zero on a net ba­sis by 2050 and make the coun­try the sec­ond G-7 na­tion to set a dead­line for phas­ing out petrol ve­hi­cles in a lit­tle over two weeks.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try min­istry will map out a plan by the year-end, chief gov­ern­ment spokesman Kat­sunobu Kato said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The like­li­hood of state in­ter­ven­tions to lower car­bon emis­sions is fu­elling a tech­no­log­i­cal race among car­mak­ers to build elec­tric cars and hy­brid petrol-elec­tric ve­hi­cles that will lure driv­ers as they switch from petrol mod­els, par­tic­u­larly in the world’s two big­gest auto mar­kets, China and the United States.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures al­ready i n place in Ja­pan mean its au­tomak­ers, par­tic­u­larly big ones such as Toy­ota Mo­tor with greater re­search and de­vel­op­ment re­sources, could use elec­tric ve­hi­cle tech­nol­ogy they have al­ready de­vel­oped at home.</p>
    <p>Nis­san Mo­tor’s chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Ash­wani Gupta last month said the com­pany was ready to re­spond to Bri­tain’s de­ci­sion to has­ten a phase-out date for new petrol and diesel pow­ered cars and vans by five years to 2030 be­cause it was part of a global trend.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s in­dus­try min­istry is con­sid­er­ing re­quir­ing all new ve­hi­cles to be elec­tric, in­clud­ing hy­brid ve­hi­cles, NHK re­ported ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Toy­ota, Honda Mo­tor, Nis­san and its al­liance part­ner Mit­subishi Mo­tors de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The share of elec­tric ve­hi­cles in Ja­pan is ex­pected to rise to 55 per cent in 2030, Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group said in a re­port on prospects for bat­tery-pow­ered cars. Glob­ally, “the speed of ex­pan­sion of the share of elec­tric ve­hi­cles will ac­cel­er­ate due to the fact that bat­tery prices are fall­ing more rapidly than ex­pected”, it added.</p>
