    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic did more to drive digi­ti­sa­tion by way of ser­vice ro­bots and in­tel­li­gent au­to­ma­tion than any or­gan­i­sa­tional leader had thought pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Much like how the 18th cen­tury in­dus­trial revo­lu­tion brought high-qual­ity, low-cost man­u­fac­tured goods to the masses, in­tel­li­gent au­to­ma­tion will bring ex­pen­sive ser­vices to the pub­lic at lower costs and with im­proved qual­ity.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine a holo­gram-based hu­manoid ser­vice ro­bot at Changi Air­port. It could be in­stalled every 50m to as­sist pas­sen­gers and deal with com­mon ques­tions like di­rec­tions to the air­port ho­tel or near­est toi­let and pro­vide ar­rival and de­par­ture in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Th­ese holo­grams re­quire only low-cost hard­ware – cam­era, mi­cro­phone, a speaker and holo­gram pro­jec­tor – and do not need to take up floor space, so trav­ellers could ac­tu­ally push their bag­gage carts through one.</p>
    <p>This is more and bet­ter ser­vices at a lower cost.</p>
    <p>Tech­nolo­gies are be­com­ing smarter, faster and more pow­er­ful while, at the same time, they get smaller, lighter and cheaper. From hard­ware – wear­ables, ro­bots and drones – to soft­ware such as speech and im­age pro­cess­ing and geo-tag­ging, tech­nol­ogy is chang­ing how con­sumers in­ter­act with busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice ro­bots and in­tel­li­gent au­to­ma­tion, in com­bi­na­tion with th­ese in­no­va­tions, will trans­form vir­tu­ally all ser­vice in­dus­tries and lead to dra­mat­i­cally im­proved cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ences, ser­vice qual­ity and pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers would al­ready be fa­mil­iar with vir­tual ro­bots such as chat­bots and vir­tual agents.</p>
    <p>Th­ese tech­nolo­gies have un­prece­dented economies of scale and scope as much of the costs is in­curred in their devel­op­ment. For ex­am­ple, vir­tual ro­bots can be scaled at close to zero in­cre­men­tal costs and phys­i­cal ro­bots cost a frac­tion of adding head­count.</p>
    <p>What is so hot about ser­vice ro­bots? They are au­ton­o­mous and can in­ter­act in a smart way with cus­tomers, abil­i­ties that make them dif­fer­ent from tra­di­tional self-ser­vice tech­nolo­gies such as ATMs, tick­et­ing ma­chines and apps.</p>
    <p>What is ex­cit­ing about ser­vice ro­bots is that they can con­duct un­struc­tured in­ter­ac­tions with cus­tomers and guide them. For ex­am­ple, a ser­vice ro­bot-pow­ered tick­et­ing ma­chine can ask trav­ellers: “Do you need a re­turn ticket? Is your re­turn trip to­day?”</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers will be able to in­ter­act with such ro­bots much the same way as with ser­vice em­ploy­ees. For ex­am­ple, they can sim­ply tell the ro­bot: “I need a same-day re­turn ticket and want to pay with Nets.”</p>
    <p>Said the wrong thing? No prob­lem, ser­vice ro­bots can adapt to cus­tomer er­rors and re­cover the op­er­a­tions’ process.</p>
    <p>Rou­tine cus­tomer in­ter­ac­tions are in­creas­ingly mov­ing from peo­ple-de­liv­ered con­tact cen­tres to vir­tual text and voice-based con­ver­sa­tional agents. Calls tend to be pre-screened and routed ei­ther to a con­ver­sa­tional agent or a hu­man, de­pend­ing on how com­plex a cus­tomer’s re­quest is.</p>
    <p>Even when in­ter­act­ing with a hu­man em­ployee, he may well be AI-sup­ported. The out­come is that the staff can spend time on higher-value and higher-level tasks and do not have to deal with high vol­umes of triv­ial cus­tomer re­quests.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, ser­vices that re­quire high cog­ni­tive and an­a­lyt­i­cal skills, such as fi­nan­cial ser­vices, can be de­liv­ered ef­fec­tively by ser­vice ro­bots.</p>
    <p>They can an­a­lyse large vol­umes of data, in­te­grate in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal in­for­ma­tion, recog­nise pat­terns and re­late th­ese to cus­tomer pro­files. Within min­utes, th­ese ro­bots can pro­pose best-fit­ting so­lu­tions and make rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>A good ex­am­ple are robo ad­vis­ers, which help to build a cus­tomer’s in­vest­ment port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is dif­fi­cult for ser­vice ro­bots to deal with emo­tions that go be­yond pleas­ant sur­face de­meanour. Here, com­plex and emo­tion­ally dif­fi­cult tasks are still best han­dled by front-line em­ploy­ees as they bring emo­tions like em­pa­thy and com­pas­sion.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, tasks that re­quire high cog­ni­tive and emo­tional skills will in­creas­ingly be de­liv­ered by hu­man-ro­bot teams. Ro­bots will do the an­a­lyt­i­cal work such as analysing symp­toms and map them against data­bases to iden­tify pos­si­ble di­ag­noses.</p>
    <p>Hu­mans, mean­while, will make the fi­nal rec­om­men­da­tions and per­form the so­cial and emo­tional tasks like pro­vid­ing ad­vice and help­ing to per­suade pa­tients to take the best course of ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice ro­bots and in­tel­li­gent au­to­ma­tion will dra­mat­i­cally change the cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence, value propo­si­tion and price.</p>
    <p>We have heard plenty about the demise of long­stand­ing shop­ping cen­tres this year. Per­haps the use of ser­vice ro­bots can be a dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing fac­tor for the re­main­ing ones.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice revo­lu­tion pro­vides op­por­tu­ni­ties for the smart and nim­ble Asian firm.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this revo­lu­tion and the scal­a­bil­ity of its tech­nolo­gies will likely lead to a dra­matic con­sol­i­da­tion of many ser­vice in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Asian lead­ers need to en­sure that their or­gan­i­sa­tions are at the van­guard of this revo­lu­tion to reap its ben­e­fits and mit­i­gate the risks.</p>
    <p>As for con­sumers, the ser­vice revo­lu­tion would be one that makes 2021 some­thing to look for­ward to.</p>
