    <p>THE­ATRE MINE Wild Rice</p>
    <p>Wild Rice@Fu­nan</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day</p>
    <p>At a lit­tle over an hour, Mine is a com­pact lit­tle playlet that does not out­stay its wel­come.</p>
    <p>This two-han­der is a nice show­case for ev­ery­one in­volved, from veteran ac­tress Karen Tan and her co-star Chanel Ariel Chan, to play­wright Tan Suet Lee and young di­rec­tor Thong Pei Qin.</p>
    <p>On a stage packed with plas­tic bags, a mother-daugh­ter drama un­folds. Chan’s Su-Lin is strug­gling with her mother Molly’s (Tan) hoard­ing in­stincts, which have turned their HDB flat into a cramped, chaotic haz­ard.</p>
    <p>Things come to a head when SuLin’s po­ten­tial boyfriend, an Amer­i­can ar­chae­ol­o­gist, wants to visit their home dur­ing a stopover.</p>
    <p>Mine at­tempts to elu­ci­date some of the dif­fi­cul­ties of liv­ing with a hoarder, as well as the men­tal strains un­der­pin­ning a hoarder’s ac­tions. This ef­fort is oc­ca­sion­ally patchy as Molly some­times seems much too self-aware. Play­wright</p>
    <p>Tan’s ar­tic­u­late lines and Karen Tan’s con­fi­dent pres­ence both work against a more nu­anced por­trait of Molly’s vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, Karen Tan and Chan work up a be­liev­able dy­namic in the push and pull of mother-daugh­ter ten­sions, which un­der­mine an es­sen­tially lov­ing re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Some lines, ex­changed in Hokkien, ring true in the pas­siveag­gres­sive notes be­tween moth­ers and daugh­ters that Asian women will in­stantly recog­nise in their own in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The dra­matic de­noue­ment i n which Su-Lin ac­ci­den­tally sets fire to the flat leads to a rather pat res­o­lu­tion which wraps ev­ery­thing up neatly. Life is sel­dom as tidy as a script.</p>
    <p>But it is good to see the­atre pieces at­tempt­ing to ad­dress im­por­tant is­sues of men­tal well-be­ing, and the fo­cus on the do­mes­tic is par­tic­u­larly res­o­nant at this time when peo­ple have been cooped up close at home.</p>
    <p>This pro­duc­tion is also note­wor­thy as it is a demon­stra­tion of Wild Rice’s com­mit­ment to the the­atre com­mu­nity. In a year which has dev­as­tated the per­form­ing arts scene, Wild Rice chose to in­vest in new the­atre-mak­ers with a Di­rect­ing Res­i­dency Pro­gramme, which of­fered young tal­ents the chance to make new shows.</p>
    <p>Mine is the first to reach the stage with three more pro­duc­tions to come over the next three months. It is heart­en­ing to see an es­tab­lished player supporting the next gen­er­a­tion of art-mak­ers, who will need the sup­port to con­tinue mak­ing work that will speak to au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>Life has been messed up by the pan­demic, but as long as au­di­ences can see sto­ries like Mine on stage, there is hope.</p>
