    <p>When pro­ject en­gi­neer David stum­bled on the chance to buy a sec­ond-hand car with­out down pay­ment, he felt that it was too good a deal to miss.</p>
    <p>David (not his real name) was earn­ing about $4,500 a month and could not af­ford a new car, as he</p>
    <p>would need to pay cash for at least 30 per cent of the price.</p>
    <p>In this case, he found a used-car dealer who would let him drive away an old car while pay­ing al­most noth­ing up­front of the $9,000 price.</p>
    <p>David, 39, was given a car loan for the whole amount on the spot, with a monthly re­pay­ment sum billed to his credit card. That day, all he had to pay for were the in­sur­ance, road tax and trans­fer fee, which he charged to his card.</p>
    <p>Since he did not feel he was spend­ing much, he also signed up for a car ser­vic­ing pack­age.</p>
    <p>David, who is sin­gle, lives with his par­ents and a younger sis­ter.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily did not know he was plan­ning to buy a car un­til he told them about his pur­chase dur­ing din­ner that night.</p>
    <p>“They ad­vised me not to spend on un­nec­es­sary items, but I just turned a deaf ear,” he says.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing able to own a car with just a few swipes of his credit card made him feel good. He be­gan to use his plas­tic more of­ten, splurg­ing on fine din­ing, en­ter­tain­ment and shop­ping.</p>
    <p>“I should have planned my bud­get in a pru­dent man­ner, re­sisted and walked away from temp­ta­tion. But sadly, I didn’t,” he says.</p>
    <p>This went on for months un­til he fi­nally hit the credit limit and could not spend any more.</p>
    <p>By then, he knew he was in trou­ble. Not only could he not re­duce his debt, there were months when he skipped re­pay­ment to­tally.</p>
    <p>This re­sulted in a se­ries of le­gal let­ters as the bank threat­ened to sue him.</p>
    <p>He re­calls: “It was dread­ful. My work was also not go­ing smoothly and the prob­lems started to es­ca­late.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult of my care­less­ness, the lit­tle debt snow­balled to a big­ger one.”</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, he did not re­alise the grav­ity of his sit­u­a­tion and bor­rowed from li­censed money­len­ders to cover his daily ex­penses.</p>
    <p>“I also tried to bor­row from friends and rel­a­tives but was re­jected. In all, I owed the cred­i­tors about $48,000.”</p>
    <p>He fi­nally turned to Credit Coun­selling Sin­ga­pore (CCS) for help, after cred­i­tors turned up at his home and passed a let­ter of de­mand to his par­ents.</p>
    <p>David knew he had to solve his own prob­lem be­cause his fa­ther, who is self-em­ployed, could take care of only the fam­ily’s ex­penses but not his debt.</p>
    <p>CCS coun­sel­lors helped him work out a bud­get for daily ex­penses as well as a monthly re­pay­ment plan for all his cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, it was quite tough, but I felt more re­lieved as I could work out my re­pay­ment plan and bud­get ac­cord­ingly,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>“I had to watch my spend­ing and cut un­nec­es­sary ex­penses on en­ter­tain­ment, which would have in­curred more cost.”</p>
    <p>David’s fi­nan­cial night­mare be­gan seven years ago.</p>
    <p>After more than 80 months of pay­ing down his debts, he was fi­nally cleared of all debts in Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>“I am re­ally thank­ful to CCS that I am debt-free now. This has taught me that we should all live within our means and stick to a bud­get.</p>
    <p>“And if you face any dif­fi­culty with your debt, do seek help im­me­di­ately and not try to avoid it like how I did ini­tially, be­cause the prob­lem will not go away.”</p>
