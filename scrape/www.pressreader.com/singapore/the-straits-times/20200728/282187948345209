    <p>Mem­bers of Hin Leong’s Lim fam­ily have asked a court to stop law firm Ra­jah & Tann Sin­ga­pore (R&T) from work­ing for court-ap­pointed su­per­vi­sors to two com­pa­nies in the Lims’ em­bat­tled oil trad­ing em­pire, Mr Evan Lim Chee Meng said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim and his sis­ter Lim Huey Ching filed an ap­pli­ca­tion to re­strain R&T from act­ing for the ju­di­cial man­agers of fleet man­ager Ocean Tankers, Mr Lim said in an email last Friday. A sim­i­lar ap­pli­ca­tion was made in re­gard to Hin Leong Trad­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>They filed the ap­pli­ca­tion on be­half of Ocean Tankers and Hin Leong Trad­ing. Mr Lim and his sis­ter are direc­tors of both com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The ac­tions are the lat­est in a se­ries stem­ming from the col­lapse ear­lier this year of Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers, both of which were placed un­der court-ap­pointed su­per­vi­sors.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong is seek­ing to re­struc­ture bil­lions of dol­lars of debt af­ter a crash in oil prices re­vealed a mas­sive, years-long fraud at the once fa­bled trad­ing house.</p>
    <p>“R&T sees no le­gal or fac­tual ba­sis for the po­si­tion now taken by the mem­bers of the Lim fam­ily pur­port­edly act­ing as direc­tors of the two com­pa­nies,” the law firm said in a state­ment to Reuters.</p>
    <p>EY, the court-ap­pointed in­terim ju­di­cial man­ager (IJM) for Ocean Tankers, and PwC, the IJM for Hin Leong, did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The Lims said in a court af­fi­davit re­viewed by Reuters that they were told by R&T on May 12 that the law firm would act for EY. They said that from the early 1990s, R&T had ad­vised and acted for their fam­ily and their group of com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>R&T pos­sessed con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion and doc­u­ments that were at risk of be­ing mis­used by the firm in its new role to ben­e­fit the su­per­vi­sors, against the fam­ily’s in­ter­ests, they said in the af­fi­davit. These in­cluded fi­nan­cial state­ments and man­age­ment ac­counts, share­hold­ers’ agree­ments, loan agree­ments and charter agree­ments re­lated to ves­sels owned by com­pa­nies owned by the Lims, they said.</p>
    <p>In the af­fi­davit, the Lims said R&T had “to date re­fused to step down de­spite re­peated re­quests to do so, which has ne­ces­si­tated this ap­pli­ca­tion”. The case will be heard on Aug 11, Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>R&T told Reuters it had never ad­vised or acted for the Lim fam­ily in con­nec­tion with the fi­nan­cial dis­tress of their com­pa­nies. It said it acted for Ocean Tankers and Hin Leong to file for ju­di­cial man­age­ment and the ap­point­ment of IJMs. Af­ter the IJMs were ap­pointed, R&T said, it agreed to con­tinue act­ing for the two com­pa­nies and for the IJMs of both firms, “sub­ject to cer­tain con­di­tions which en­sured that there would not be a con­flict of in­ter­est or abuse of con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the ju­di­cial man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tions for Hin Leong Trad­ing and Ocean Tankers were ad­journed to Aug 7 due to slip-ups by law firms in fail­ing to pub­lish the ap­pli­ca­tions in the news­pa­pers and govern­ment gazette, as re­quired by the law.</p>
