    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s most pop­u­lous state of New South Wales (NSW) re­ported eight new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, while neigh­bour­ing Vic­to­ria’s tally in­creased by three, as new mea­sures to com­bat the dis­ease kicked in.</p>
    <p>The NSW out­break started around mid-De­cem­ber in Syd­ney’s North­ern Beaches area, where a quar­ter of a mil­lion peo­ple are in strict lock­down un­til Jan 9. Cases as­so­ci­ated with the clus­ter now to­tal 148.</p>
    <p>A smaller clus­ter in the west of the city, linked to a dif­fer­ent genome se­quence, has 13 con­firmed cases. But the state’s chief health of­fi­cer, Dr Kerry Chant, said the au­thor­i­ties are wor­ried as re­cent trans­mis­sion at a liquor store oc­curred with “fleet­ing” ex­po­sure. “We know these trans­mis­sion events have hap­pened through very min­i­mal ex­po­sure. We are ask­ing mem­bers of the com­mu­nity who did pur­chase al­co­hol or en­ter that premises for that pe­riod to be very vig­i­lant.”</p>
    <p>NSW has made wear­ing masks manda­tory at in­door venues like gam­ing rooms, hair sa­lons and shops as the au­thor­i­ties try to limit the spread of the dis­ease. They will be legally en­forced from mid­night lo­cal time. Any­one found not wear­ing masks in in­door venues such as shops, churches and on pub­lic trans­port will be fined A$200 (S$206).</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has avoided the worst of the pan­demic fol­low­ing swift ac­tion by the au­thor­i­ties to shut bor­ders, en­force lock­downs, and carry out wide­spread test­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic be­gan, it has re­ported more than 28,450 Covid-19 cases and 909 deaths.</p>
    <p>De­spite the out­break in Syd­ney, a sched­uled five-day cricket match be­tween Aus­tralia and In­dia, start­ing on Thurs­day, will go ahead, al­though with a re­duced num­ber of spec­ta­tors. Five In­dian play­ers have been placed in iso­la­tion while the Aus­tralian and In­dian cricket boards in­ves­ti­gate al­le­ga­tions of a breach of biose­cu­rity pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>In Vic­to­ria, where all cases are linked to the same Mel­bourne restau­rant, of­fi­cials are in­ves­ti­gat­ing how the dis­ease spread from the source in NSW, au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria has more than 30 ac­tive cases and has made masks manda­tory across the state, re­stricted the num­ber of peo­ple who can meet so­cially and shut its bor­der with NSW on Satur­day. The health au­thor­i­ties have iden­ti­fied 220 “close con­tacts” and more than 50 “ex­po­sure sites” linked to pos­i­tive cases.</p>
    <p>But “what is im­por­tant is that they are in quar­an­tine when they are di­ag­nosed so that the risk of on­ward trans­mis­sion is re­duced”, Vic­to­ria’s deputy chief health of­fi­cer said in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>More than 18,900 peo­ple in New South Wales were tested on Satur­day. Act­ing Pre­mier John Bar­i­laro yes­ter­day urged more to get tested.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s virus re­sponse com­man­der also urged res­i­dents in his state to main­tain test­ing lev­els, par­tic­u­larly if they had re­turned from NSW af­ter the bor­der was closed.</p>
