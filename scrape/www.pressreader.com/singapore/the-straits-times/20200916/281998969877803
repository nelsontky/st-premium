    <p>LON­DON • A sum­mit be­tween the Euro­pean Union and China, ini­tially billed as the most con­se­quen­tial of its kind this year, has pro­duced no ma­jor re­sults, apart from in­ten­si­fied EU de­mands on Bei­jing to open up its mar­kets and im­prove China’s record on hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>“In the last 15 years, China has be­come much stronger eco­nom­i­cally and this means that the de­mand for rec­i­proc­ity – for a level play­ing field – is of course very jus­ti­fied to­day,” Ger­man Chan­cel­lor Angela Merkel, whose coun­try holds the ro­tat­ing pres­i­dency of the EU for the rest of this year, told the me­dia after the vir­tual sum­mit con­cluded on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>Adding her own read­out of the sum­mit, Dr Ur­sula von der Leyen, pres­i­dent of the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive body, de­scribed the di­a­logue with Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping as “frank”, “open” and even “in­tense”, terms that diplo­mats use to de­scribe fun­da­men­tal dis­agree­ments.</p>
    <p>This year’s sum­mit was ini­tially en­vi­sioned as the mo­ment for a break­through in EU-Chi­nese re­la­tions. After years of fruit­less dis­cus­sions, the EU has made it clear that it in­sists on the con­clu­sion of a com­pre­hen­sive in­vest­ment agree­ment that ad­dresses what the Euro­peans see as un­fair Chi­nese re­stric­tions and trad­ing prac­tices, as well as un­fet­tered ac­cess to Chi­nese mar­kets.</p>
    <p>And, at least for a while, it ap­peared that Bei­jing re­alised the need for real Chi­nese com­pro­mises with Europe, par­tic­u­larly since China’s re­la­tions with the United States have nose­dived.</p>
    <p>Chan­cel­lor Merkel also en­ter­tained hopes that the sum­mit would take place with the lead­ers present in per­son, rather than vir­tu­ally, thereby fa­cil­i­tat­ing progress in bi­lat­eral links.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, how­ever, none of this hap­pened. Europe’s coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates did not per­mit stag­ing the sum­mit in per­son, and China proved un­ready to of­fer the kind of trade con­ces­sions the Euro­peans were hop­ing for.</p>
    <p>The EU and China did sign a land­mark “ge­o­graph­i­cal in­di­ca­tions” agree­ment this week, in which China un­der­took to clamp down on imi­ta­tion food prod­ucts pre­tend­ing to be of Euro­pean ori­gin.</p>
    <p>So, prod­ucts – such as Greek feta cheese, Ital­ian Parma ham or Ir­ish whiskey – from ap­proved Euro­pean pro­duc­ers will be legally pro­tected in Chi­nese mar­kets.</p>
    <p>This is note­wor­thy since China is the third-largest des­ti­na­tion of EU agri­cul­tural ex­ports, a mar­ket val­ued at €14.5 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$23.4 bil­lion) last year.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel made much of this break­through, but glossed over the fact that the agree­ment on food cov­ers only 2.6 per cent of the EU’s €560 bil­lion yearly bi­lat­eral trade with China.</p>
    <p>And, be­yond that, the sum­mit pro­duced noth­ing new, apart from agree­ment to talk fur­ther.</p>
    <p>On broader po­lit­i­cal ques­tions, EU lead­ers were ex­pected to ex­press dis­ap­proval of China’s re­cent moves in Hong Kong, and par­tic­u­larly the en­force­ment of the new na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion in the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>But Euro­pean of­fi­cials went much fur­ther, by pub­licly call­ing on China “to as­sume greater re­spon­si­bil­ity in deal­ing with global chal­lenges through the rules-based in­ter­na­tional sys­tem, pro­mot­ing in­ter­na­tional peace and se­cu­rity, and ad­her­ing to in­ter­na­tional stan­dards to sup­port sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, es­pe­cially in Africa”.</p>
    <p>This is the kind of blunt lan­guage the EU has not used with China for many years.</p>
    <p>And, in a fur­ther de­par­ture from past prac­tice, EU of­fi­cials also pressed China to al­low ac­cess to Xin­jiang, where the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties are ac­cused of plac­ing Uighurs in in­tern­ment camps.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi was also pre­sented with de­mands to ex­plain the fate of both Euro­pean and Cana­dian cit­i­zens cur­rently un­der ar­rest in China.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that the mood on China has fun­da­men­tally changed in Europe.</p>
    <p>Cov­er­age of the sum­mit in the Euro­pean me­dia was over­whelm­ingly neg­a­tive to China.</p>
    <p>And, at the vir­tual press con­fer­ence held im­me­di­ately after the sum­mit, EU of­fi­cials were as­sailed with ques­tions about what they pro­posed to do to in­crease pres­sure on Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Chan­cel­lor Merkel en­ter­tained hopes that the sum­mit would take place with the lead­ers present in per­son... Europe’s coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates did not per­mit stag­ing the sum­mit in per­son, and China proved un­ready to of­fer the kind of trade con­ces­sions the Euro­peans were hop­ing for.</p>
