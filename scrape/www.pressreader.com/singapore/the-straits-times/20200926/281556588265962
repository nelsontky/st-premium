    <p>China lashed out at the US at a United Na­tions meet­ing over its crit­i­cism on the coro­n­avirus, with en­voy Zhang Jun declar­ing: “Enough is enough.” The United States should blame its own politi­cians for fail­ing to rein in the coun­try’s virus cri­sis, he said. His re­marks came af­ter US Am­bas­sador Kelly Craft opened with an­gry words. WORLD</p>
    <p>UNITED NA­TIONS • China has lashed out at the United States at a high-level UN meet­ing over its crit­i­cism on the coro­n­avirus, with its en­voy declar­ing: “Enough is enough!”</p>
    <p>Two days af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump used his an­nual ad­dress to the Gen­eral Assem­bly to at­tack China’s record, the Amer­i­can am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions also took an out­raged tone – af­ter which her Chi­nese coun­ter­part showed pal­pa­ble anger.</p>
    <p>“I must say, enough is enough! You have cre­ated enough trou­bles for the world al­ready,” Chi­nese en­voy Zhang Jun told a Se­cu­rity Coun­cil meet­ing on global gov­er­nance at­tended through video­con­fer­ence by sev­eral heads of state on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“The US has nearly seven mil­lion con­firmed cases and over 200,000 deaths by now. With the most ad­vanced med­i­cal tech­nolo­gies and sys­tem in the world, why has the US turned out to have the most con­firmed cases and fa­tal­i­ties?” he asked in English.</p>
    <p>“If some­one should be held ac­count­able, it should be a few US politi­cians them­selves.”</p>
    <p>Us­ing a phrase of­ten told by US lead­ers to China, Mr Zhang said: “The US should un­der­stand that a ma­jor power should be­have like a ma­jor power.”</p>
    <p>The US “is com­pletely iso­lated”, he said in re­marks en­thu­si­as­ti­cally backed by his Rus­sian coun­ter­part.</p>
    <p>His re­marks came af­ter the US am­bas­sador, Ms Kelly Craft, opened with an­gry words that took diplo­mats off-guard.</p>
    <p>“You know, shame on each of you. I am as­ton­ished and I am dis­gusted by the con­tent of to­day’s dis­cus­sion,” Ms Craft said.</p>
    <p>“I am ac­tu­ally re­ally quite ashamed of this coun­cil – mem­bers of the coun­cil who took this op­por</p>
    <p>I must say, enough is enough! You have cre­ated enough trou­bles for the world al­ready... The US has nearly seven mil­lion con­firmed cases and over 200,000 deaths by now. With the most ad­vanced med­i­cal tech­nolo­gies and sys­tem in the world, why has the US turned out to have the most con­firmed cases and fa­tal­i­ties? If some­one should be held ac­count­able, it should be a few US politi­cians them­selves.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S UNITED NA­TIONS AM­BAS­SADOR ZHANG JUN, re­spond­ing to Washington’s re­peated ac­cu­sa­tions that the Covid-19 pan­demic was wors­ened by China’s lack of trans­parency on the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>tu­nity to fo­cus on po­lit­i­cal grudges rather than the crit­i­cal is­sue at hand. My good­ness.”</p>
    <p>Diplo­mats said they were puz­zled at the tone of Ms Craft, who had left by the time the Chi­nese am­bas­sador spoke. Ms Craft was “very ag­gres­sive” af­ter a ses­sion that had been “more or less full of con­sen­sus”, one diplo­mat said on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>With world lead­ers asked to send speeches in ad­vance for a vir­tual Gen­eral Assem­bly, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping could not re­ply on Tues­day to Mr Trump and de­liv­ered a mild-man­nered speech in which he un­veiled more am­bi­tious tar­gets on cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>But the spokesman for the Gen­eral Assem­bly, Mr Bren­den Varma, said China had re­quested to speak next Tues­day, the day set up for any na­tion to re­ply to state­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump in his speech had de­manded ac­tion against China for spread­ing the “plague” of Covid-19 to the world.</p>
    <p>News of the res­pi­ra­tory dis­ease was sup­pressed in China when it first emerged last year in Wuhan and ini­tial ad­vice played down the risks of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>China’s com­mu­nist lead­ers have more re­cently tried to trans­form the nar­ra­tive into one of the coun­try’s suc­cess in stop­ping the virus.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s re­sponse to the pan­demic – which he has provoca­tively called the “China virus” – has emerged as a ma­jor po­lit­i­cal is­sue as he seeks a new term in the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral African lead­ers used their vir­tual ad­dresses to the Gen­eral Assem­bly to plead for more in­ter­na­tional as­sis­tance, fear­ing that Covid-19 will im­pede de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Our na­tions are ask­ing for fi­nan­cial sup­port that rises to the level of the eco­nomic cri­sis they’re wit­ness­ing,” said Niger Pres­i­dent Ma­hamadou Is­soufou.</p>
    <p>“Just a debt mora­to­rium will not be enough, faced with the chal­lenges that have arisen. We sim­ply have to can­cel the debt com­pletely,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Group of 20 ma­jor economies in mid-April sus­pended debt pay­ments for the poor­est na­tions through the end of the year as they face ma­jor bud­get short­falls due to the Covid-19 shut­down.</p>
    <p>The African Union is seek­ing to ex­tend the mora­to­rium through next year, warn­ing of dire eco­nomic ef­fects from the health cri­sis.</p>
