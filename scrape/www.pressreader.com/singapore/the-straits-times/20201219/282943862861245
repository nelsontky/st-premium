    <p>NEW YORK • Prop­erty in­vestors are about to dis­cover j ust how much the global fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has spread from de­serted and cast-off build­ings to their bottom lines.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives tracked in earn­ings calls around the world in the past five months ad­dressed the ur­gency of cut­ting real es­tate costs, ac­cord­ing to an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence model trained by Bloomberg to scour tran­scripts.</p>
    <p>Tac­tics in­clude cut­ting of­fice space, ac­cel­er­at­ing branch clo­sures, rene­go­ti­at­ing rents on ware­houses and shut­ting data cen­tres.</p>
    <p>In 4,767 global earn­ings calls be­tween July 21 and Dec 8, about one in eight ma­chine-gen­er­ated tran­scripts re­vealed that com­pa­nies were re­think­ing their real es­tate needs, with many on track to save mil­lions of dol­lars in the process.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic has squeezed land­lords and clob­bered se­cu­ri­ties linked to com­mer­cial real es­tate, the dam­age to cash flows is the long-tail risk for in­vestors.</p>
    <p>In an es­ti­mated US$10 tril­lion (S$13.3 tril­lion) global pool of prop­er­ties held for in­vest­ment pur­poses, the industry’s main sources of cap­i­tal – pen­sion funds and in­sur­ance com­pa­nies – count on the steady in­come to pay for their own long-term com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>“That’s the key ra­tio­nale for buy­ing real es­tate. Most land­lords are in ef­fect pen­sion and in­sur­ance funds and, ul­ti­mately, that’s who is go­ing to be pay­ing for it,” said Mr Adrian Bene­dict, head of real es­tate so­lu­tions at Fidelity In­ter­na­tional in Lon­don. “If the whole cen­tral tenet of se­cu­rity of in­come is un­der­mined through this cri­sis, you are stor­ing up a world of trou­ble.”</p>
    <p>In­vestors are al­ready hurt­ing: A global in­dex of real es­tate shares has shed more than 10 per cent this year as a gauge of all types of stocks surged about 13 per cent.</p>
    <p>On the debt side, delin­quen­cies on United States com­mer­cial mort­gages climbed to al­most 6 per cent last month, ac­cord­ing to the Mort­gage Bankers As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Risk pre­mi­ums for BBB-rated com­mer­cial mort­gage-backed se­cu­ri­ties have al­most dou­bled since the start of the year, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg Bar­clays in­dex data.</p>
    <p>As the re­ces­sion deep­ens and com­pa­nies brace them­selves for the new nor­mal, busi­nesses will need less space than they did be­fore.</p>
    <p>While the coro­n­avirus vac­cine has thrilled in­vestors world­wide and sent real es­tate stocks re­bound­ing, cel­e­bra­tions may turn out to be pre­ma­ture.</p>
    <p>The changes that of­fi­cials have been dis­cussing are of­ten of a per­ma­nent and struc­tural na­ture, with the fore­cast sav­ings largely wel­comed by com­pany share­hold­ers and an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>“We will im­ple­ment a hy­brid work­ing model for many of our col­leagues and re­duce our real es­tate foot­print by ap­prox­i­mately 12 per cent,” said Mr John Kritz­macher, chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer of John Wi­ley & Sons.</p>
