    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump went on the of­fen­sive against Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den yes­ter­day with a cam­paign trip to New Hamp­shire, a state he nar­rowly lost in 2016 but is try­ing to re­claim i n this year’s White House race.</p>
    <p>With just over a week left un­til the Nov 3 US elec­tion, the Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent is storm­ing his way through top bat­tle­ground states in a late push to make up ground against Mr Bi­den, who leads in na­tional opin­ion polls.</p>
    <p>Opin­ion polls in many of the most vi­tal swing states that will de­cide the elec­tion show a closer race.</p>
    <p>New Hamp­shire, which Mr Trump lost to Demo­crat Hil­lary Clin­ton by about 3,000 votes in 2016, has not been con­sid­ered a top-tier bat­tle­ground, and most polls show Mr Bi­den with a com­fort­able edge in the New Eng­land state.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump is run­ning out of time and op­por­tu­ni­ties to change minds and shift the race in his favour.</p>
    <p>More than 56.5 mil­lion Amer­i­cans have al­ready voted in per­son or by mail, a pace of early vot­ing that could lead to the high­est voter turnout rate in more than a cen­tury, ac­cord­ing to data from the US Elec­tions Project.</p>
    <p>Af­ter vot­ing early in his home state of Florida on Satur­day, Mr Trump raced through ral­lies in three states – North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin – where he promised that the end of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic was in sight and said Mr Bi­den would threaten jobs by push­ing for more Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In Ohio, Mr Trump said his cam­paign was do­ing well and he was not wor­ried about the public opin­ion polls.</p>
    <p>“We have 10 days, and noth­ing wor­ries me,” he said.</p>
    <p>On his visit to New Hamp­shire, Mr Trump will hold a rally in Manch­ester. He has sug­gested he might hold five ral­lies a day down the fi­nal stretch be­fore the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who made two cam­paign stops in Penn­syl­va­nia on Satur­day, had no public sched­ule for yes­ter­day, although the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent of­ten makes a trip to church.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his swing through Penn­syl­va­nia, Mr Bi­den re­newed his crit­i­cism of Mr Trump for not tak­ing the health cri­sis se­ri­ously enough, and warned of a resur­gence of the virus – which has killed nearly 225,000 Amer­i­cans and is on the rise in sev­eral bat­tle­ground states – dur­ing the win­ter months.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be a dark win­ter ahead un­less we change our ways,” he said of Mr Trump’s at­tempts to con­tain the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The US set a sin­gle-day record of more than 84,000 new Covid-19 cases on Fri­day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally, with the spike in in­fec</p>
    <p>tions hit­ting elec­tion swing states Ohio, Michi­gan, North Carolina, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wisconsin.</p>
    <p>Late on Satur­day, a spokesman for Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence dis­closed that Mr Marc Short, Mr Pence’s chief of staff, has tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>One of Mr Pence’s clos­est po­lit­i­cal ad­vis­ers, Mr Marty Obst, had tested pos­i­tive last Wed­nes­day, adding fur­ther to the cases in and around the White House.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence and his wife tested neg­a­tive ear­lier in the day and the Vi­cePres­i­dent will not al­ter his sched­ule, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>In the state­ment, Mr Pence’s of­fice ac­knowl­edged that he is con­sid­ered a close con­tact of Mr Short un­der in­fec­tion trac­ing pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence trav­elled to Florida to de­liver a cam­paign speech in Tal­la­has­see on Satur­day evening af­ter learn­ing of Mr Short’s di­ag­no­sis, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter. Mr Short, who tested pos­i­tive ear­lier in the day, did not ac­com­pany him.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence was sched­uled to cam­paign yes­ter­day in Kin­ston, North Carolina.</p>
    <p>Con­cern about the health risks of vot­ing in crowded polling places on elec­tion day has helped drive the stam­pede to vote, as many states have in­creased early vot­ing and vote-by-mail op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>In New York state, vot­ers jammed polling places and stood in line for hours to cast bal­lots on the state’s first day of early vot­ing on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Long lines formed be­fore polls opened across New York City and Long Is­land, videos on so­cial me­dia showed.</p>
