    <p>•</p>
    <p>China’s fac­tory ac­tiv­ity ex­panded at a slightly slower pace last month but was still above an­a­lysts’ ex­pec­ta­tions, sug­gest­ing a con­tin­u­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery as the coun­try re­bounds from the coro­n­avirus shock.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial man­u­fac­tur­ing Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) fell to 51.4 last month from 51.5 in Septem­ber, data from the Na­tional Bureau of Statis­tics (NBS) showed yes­ter­day, re­main­ing above the 50-point mark that sep­a­rates growth from con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts had ex­pected it to slip slightly to 51.3, but said a broader re­cov­ery still ap­peared to be solidly on track.</p>
    <p>The data, par­tic­u­larly new ex­port or­ders, in­di­cates that last month’s trade fig­ures should stay strong, Mr Zhou Mao­hua, an an­a­lyst at China Ever­bright Bank, said in a note.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the epi­demic’s spread over­seas could in­crease un­cer­tain­ties for China’s ex­ports over the next few months, Mr Zhou added.</p>
    <p>China’s vast in­dus­trial sec­tor is steadily re­turn­ing to the lev­els seen be­fore the pan­demic paral­ysed huge swathes of the econ­omy. Pent-up de­mand, stim­u­lus­driven in­fra­struc­ture ex­pan­sion and sur­pris­ingly re­silient ex­ports are pro­pel­ling the re­bound, though the global out­look is dim­ming as many West­ern coun­tries bat­tle re­newed surges of Covid-19, with some go­ing back into lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial PMI, which largely fo­cuses on big and state-owned firms, showed over­all new or­ders re­mained steady at 52.8, while new ex­port or­ders rose to 51, im­prov­ing from 50.8 a month ear­lier.</p>
    <p>But smaller firms con­tin­ued to strug­gle. A sub-in­dex for those com­pa­nies stood at 49.4 last month, slip­ping back into con­trac­tion from Septem­ber’s 50.1.</p>
    <p>Firms also shed jobs for a sixth month in a row, and at a faster pace. A sub-in­dex for em­ploy­ment fell to 49.3 from Septem­ber’s 49.6.</p>
    <p>“The man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try over­all con­tin­ues to pick up,” said NBS of­fi­cial Zhao Qinghe, while not­ing that small com­pa­nies face weak mar­ket de­mand.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies re­ported that the resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus over­seas had length­ened pro­cure­ment pe­ri­ods for im­ports of raw ma­te­ri­als and in­creased trans­port costs, Mr Zhao said in a state­ment re­leased with the data.</p>
    <p>China’s econ­omy grew a weak­erthan-ex­pected 4.9 per cent in the third quar­ter year on year.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to ex­pand around 2 per cent for the full year – the weak­est in over three decades but still much stronger than other ma­jor economies.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has been largely con­trolled in China, with daily life in much of the coun­try re­turn­ing to nor­mal, al­though an out­break emerged re­cently in the west­ern re­gion of Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>A sis­ter sur­vey on the ser­vice sec­tor showed ac­tiv­ity ex­panded for the eighth straight month, hit­ting the high­est level since Oc­to­ber 2013, as the re­moval of re­stric­tions on pub­lic gath­er­ings and move­ment bol­stered con­sumer de­mand.</p>
