    <p>If you of­ten play games on your An­droid smart­phone, you might want to check out the Razer Kishi.</p>
    <p>It is a universal mo­bile gam­ing con­troller with a fa­mil­iar con­sole­like lay­out of but­tons, joy­sticks and trig­gers, to con­vert your smart­phone into a por­ta­ble gam­ing con­sole.</p>
    <p>The Kishi con­sists of two grips con­nected by a rub­ber strap with a plas­tic plate at its rear. The right grip has the A/B/X/Y but­tons, a func­tion but­ton and a joy­stick, while the left grip has an eight-way direc­tional pad, a joy­stick, a home but­ton and a func­tion but­ton. Two trig­gers are sited at the top of each grip.</p>
    <p>The two grips clip to­gether for easy stor­age and de­tach when the re­lease latch at the back of each grip is pressed.</p>
    <p>When de­tached, you will find a USB-C con­nec­tor (Light­ning ver­sion com­ing later) on the right grip’s in­side. At­tach your An­droid smart­phone’s USB-C port to it, mount the left grip on the top of the smart­phone, and you get a Nin­tendo Switch-like gam­ing con­sole with your smart­phone.</p>
    <p>Your smart­phone has to have a cen­tre-aligned USB-C port on its base and run at least An­droid 8.0. Of­fi­cially sup­ported smart­phones in­clude the Google Pixel 2 and later, Sam­sung Galaxy S8 and later (the S20 Ul­tra is not sup­ported though), Galaxy Note8 and later, and Razer Phone 1 and 2.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Kishi should fit any An­droid 8 smart­phone with a cen­tre-aligned USB-C port that falls within these di­men­sions – a height be­tween 145.3mm and 163.7mm, a width be­tween 68.2mm and 78.1mm, and a depth be­tween 7mm and 8.8mm. For this re­view, I used a Google Pixel 4 and a Sam­sung Galaxy Note10+, with the Note10+ just fit­ting the Kishi.</p>
    <p>You can down­load the Razer Kishi app, which al­lows you to up­date its firmware and also of­fers a long list of com­pat­i­ble games. But you do not need the app for the Kishi to work.</p>
    <p>If a mo­bile game sup­ports ex­ter­nal con­trollers, it should be com­pat­i­ble with the Kishi. Some pop­u­lar mo­bile games, such as Play­erUn­known’s Bat­tle­grounds Mo­bile, Fort­nite and Call Of Duty Mo­bile, are not sup­ported though.</p>
    <p>But the sup­ported games I tried work like a charm.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, with the mo­bile rac­ing game As­phalt 9, I was able to use the Kishi’s trig­gers to drift and ac­ti­vate ni­tro boosts right from the start.</p>
    <p>Play­ing the ac­tion role-play­ing game Dun­geon Hunter 5 with the Kishi’s joy­sticks and but­tons feels much more in­tu­itive than us­ing the smart­phone’s touch­screen to move my char­ac­ter and per­form at­tack moves.</p>
    <p>The Kishi also feels as er­gonomic as con­sole con­trollers, al­low­ing me to play more com­fort­ably for longer with­out suf­fer­ing fin­ger cramps.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, with its di­rect USB-C con­nec­tion, there is vir­tu­ally no lag with its con­trols, un­like with a wire­less Blue­tooth con­nec­tion. How­ever, this means you can­not use wired USB-C head­phones.</p>
    <p>Also, I found my smart­phone’s bat­tery drain­ing faster when us­ing the Kishi. Thank­fully, there is a USB-C port on the right grip’s bot­tom that al­lows for pass-through charg­ing.</p>
