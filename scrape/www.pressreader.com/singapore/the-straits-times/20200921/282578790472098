    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain’s Queen El­iz­a­beth II has stripped Har­vey We­in­stein of the royal hon­our he was awarded be­fore his preda­tory sex crimes came to light, an of­fi­cial gov­ern­ment state­ment said last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The dis­graced Hol­ly­wood movie mogul, who is cur­rently serv­ing a 23-year jail term for rape, re­ceived the hon­our in 2004 in recog­ni­tion of his con­tri­bu­tion to the Bri­tish film in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>But an an­nounce­ment i n The Gazette, the Bri­tish of­fi­cial gov­ern­ment record, said it had been with­drawn.</p>
    <p>“The Queen has di­rected that the ap­point­ment of Har­vey We­in­stein to be an Honorary Com­man­der of the Civil Di­vi­sion of the Most Ex­cel­lent Or­der of the Bri­tish Empire, dated 29 Jan­uary 2004, shall be can­celled and an­nulled and that his name shall be erased from the Regis­ter of the said Or­der,” it read.</p>
    <p>Royal honours can be for­feited in cir­cum­stances where Buck­ing­ham Palace con­sid­ers the sys­tem has been brought into dis­re­pute.</p>
    <p>De­ci­sions are ap­proved by the monarch her­self.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous re­cip­i­ents who have had their honours re­moved in­clude Rolf Har­ris, the Aus­tralian-born en­ter­tainer and artist who was jailed in 2014 for a string of sex­ual as­saults.</p>
    <p>He had been given a CBE in 2006 af­ter paint­ing Queen El­iz­a­beth’s por­trait to mark her 80th birth­day. He was also stripped of his Aus­tralian honours.</p>
    <p>Zim­babwe’s for­mer pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe lost his honorary knight­hood in 2008 be­cause of what the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment said were “hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions” and “dis­re­gard” for democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Ro­ma­nia’s com­mu­nist-era dic­ta­tor Ni­co­lae Ceaus­escu had his honorary knight­hood with­drawn in 1989, the day be­fore his ex­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>In 1979, art his­to­rian An­thony Blunt, who ad­vised the Queen, also lost his knight­hood af­ter he was ex­posed as a Soviet spy.</p>
    <p>Most for­fei­tures fol­low crim­i­nal con­vic­tions and jail terms.</p>
    <p>In 2012, Fred Good­win, the for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Royal Bank of Scot­land Group (RBS), lost his ti­tle of “sir” be­cause of the “scale and sever­ity of the im­pact of his ac­tions as CEO of RBS” dur­ing the fi­nan­cial crash four years ear­lier.</p>
