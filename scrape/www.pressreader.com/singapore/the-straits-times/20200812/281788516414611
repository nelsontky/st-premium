    <p>TAIPEI • US Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar has at­tacked China’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and said that if such an out­break had emerged in Tai­wan or the United States, it could have been “snuffed out eas­ily”.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party had the chance to warn the world and work with the world on bat­tling the virus. But they chose not to, and the costs of that choice mount higher ev­ery day,” Mr Azar said yes­ter­day in Taipei.</p>
    <p>He is in Tai­wan for a three-day visit, billed as the high­est-level visit by a US of­fi­cial since Wash­ing­ton switched diplo­matic recog­ni­tion from the is­land to China in 1979.</p>
    <p>Beijing sees Tai­wan as a break­away prov­ince to be re­uni­fied by force if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, For­eign Min­is­ter Joseph Wu told Mr Azar that China is try­ing to turn demo­cratic Tai­wan into an­other Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mr Wu said Tai­wan lives un­der the con­stant threat of hav­ing its free­doms taken away by China.</p>
    <p>“Our daily lives have be­come in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult as China con­tin­ues to pres­sure Tai­wan into ac­cept­ing its po­lit­i­cal con­di­tions, con­di­tions that will turn Tai­wan i nto the next Hong Kong,” Mr Wu said.</p>
    <p>A crack­down on dis­sent in Hong Kong has gath­ered pace since China im­posed a sweep­ing se­cu­rity law on the fi­nan­cial hub on June 30, with op­po­si­tion politi­cians dis­qual­i­fied from polls, and ac­tivists ar­rested.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity clam­p­down has caused alarm in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar has heaped praise on Tai­wan’s democ­racy, hail­ing it as a “demo­cratic suc­cess story, and a force for good in the world”.</p>
    <p>His trip comes as re­la­tions be­tween the US and China are in tu­mult, with the two sides clash­ing over a wide range of trade, mil­i­tary and se­cu­rity is­sues, as well as the han­dling of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>As the coro­n­avirus emerged, China did not live up to its “bind­ing” in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions in a be­trayal of the co­op­er­a­tive spirit needed for global health, Mr Azar said, wear­ing a face mask as he has done for all his public events in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve it is no ex­ag­ger­a­tion to say that if this virus had emerged in a place like Tai­wan or the United States, it might have been snuffed out eas­ily – rapidly re­ported to public health au­thor­i­ties, who would have shared what they knew with health pro­fes­sion­als and with the gen­eral public,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, Beijing ap­pears to have re­sisted in­for­ma­tion shar­ing, muz­zling doc­tors who spoke out and hob­bling the world’s abil­ity to re­spond.”</p>
    <p>The US has the high­est num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions and deaths in the world, while Tai­wan has been praised by health ex­perts for its early and ef­fec­tive steps to con­trol the out­break, with only 480 in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing seven deaths.</p>
    <p>HIGH COSTS The Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party had the chance to warn the world and work with the world on bat­tling the virus. But they chose not to, and the costs of that choice ’’ mount higher ev­ery day. U.S. HEALTH SEC­RE­TARY ALEX AZAR</p>
