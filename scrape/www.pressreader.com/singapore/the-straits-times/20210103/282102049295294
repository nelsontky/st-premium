    <p>In Fe­bru­ary 2014, Lon­don’s Un­der­ground was par­tially shut down by a strike that forced many com­muters to find new ways to get to work. The dis­rup­tion lasted just 48 hours, but when econ­o­mists Shaun Lar­com, Fer­di­nand Rauch and Tim Willems stud­ied data from the city’s trans­port net­work, they dis­cov­ered some­thing in­ter­est­ing.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of com­muters did not re­turn to their orig­i­nal routes, pre­sum­ably hav­ing found faster or more pleas­ant ways to reach their des­ti­na­tion. A few hours of dis­rup­tion were enough to make them re­alise that they had been do­ing com­mut­ing wrong their en­tire adult lives.</p>
    <p>I men­tion this be­cause we are at a turn­ing point in the pan­demic. Many peo­ple have largely been work­ing from home. For months, it has been hard to shake the feel­ing that this will last for ever. Now we are con­tem­plat­ing a vac­cine-fu­elled re­turn to nor­mal­ity – maybe not to­day, maybe not to­mor­row, but soon.</p>
    <p>What the 2014 Tube strike teaches us is that tem­po­rary dis­rup­tions can have per­ma­nent ef­fects. Some­times there are scars that do not heal; some­times a cri­sis teaches us lessons we can use when it has passed.</p>
    <p>So what have we learnt from the re­mote-work­ing ex­per­i­ment? And to what ex­tent will it con­tinue af­ter the virus has re­treated?</p>
    <p>One ob­vi­ous point is that, like a strike-de­layed com­muter who in­vests in a new bike, both work­ers and em­ploy­ers have sunk con­sid­er­able time and ef­fort into ac­quir­ing the equip­ment and skills nec­es­sary to sup­port the change.</p>
    <p>Such in­vest­ments will make work­ing from home cheaper and more tempt­ing in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>I sus­pect, how­ever, that the cru­cial step is not in­vest­ment but in­for­ma­tion. We have learnt that work­ing from home is more pro­duc­tive than we had guessed.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists Emma Har­ring­ton and Natalia Emanuel from Har­vard Univer­sity found that be­fore the pan­demic, re­mote work­ers at one large com­pany had been less pro­duc­tive than of­fice-based work­ers. Yet when ev­ery­one switched to re­mote work, over­all pro­duc­tiv­ity in­creased.</p>
    <p>The ex­pla­na­tion for the ap­par­ent con­tra­dic­tion is that work­ing from home is in­trin­si­cally more pro­duc­tive, but this truth was ob­scured by the fact that fewer pro­duc­tive work­ers were at­tracted to work­ing from home. Now that em­ploy­ers have dis­cov­ered that the ap­par­ent pro­duc­tiv­ity penalty is il­lu­sory, per­haps re­mote work will be far more pop­u­lar in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, a fa­mous study of re­mote work by Pro­fes­sor</p>
    <p>Ni­cholas Bloom and his col­leagues an­a­lysed a ran­domised ex­per­i­ment at Ctrip, a large Chi­nese travel agency, in which some staff were as­signed to work from home. The ex­pec­ta­tion was that pro­duc­tiv­ity would fall but the costs of pro­vid­ing of­fice space would fall too. In­stead, Prof Bloom and his col­leagues found that work­ers be­came sharply more pro­duc­tive at home.</p>
    <p>All this sug­gests that the pan­demic, like the Tube strike, will be the jolt that pushes us into do­ing the re­mote work­ing we should have been do­ing all along. But I am not so sure.</p>
    <p>One point that is eas­ily over­looked is that, in both these stud­ies, the work­ers in ques­tion were mov­ing from tak­ing calls in a call cen­tre to tak­ing calls at home.</p>
    <p>In Prof Bloom’s re­search, the home work­ers and of­fice work­ers used the same equip­ment and or­der-flow soft­ware, did the same tasks and were re­warded with the same bonuses.</p>
    <p>This should also be a warn­ing not to draw con­clu­sions that are too broad. In a well-run call cen­tre, the pro­to­cols for as­sign­ing, mon­i­tor­ing and clos­ing out tasks are well es­tab­lished. It does not re­quire a chain of group e-mails to fig­ure out what is hap­pen­ing or to sched­ule a Zoom call. The same is not true of much knowl­edge work.</p>
    <p>As As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor</p>
    <p>Cal New­port, author of the forth­com­ing A World With­out Email, pointed out in The New Yorker last May: “The knowl­edge work pur­sued in many mod­ern of­fices – think­ing, in­ves­ti­gat­ing, syn­the­sis­ing, writ­ing, plan­ning, or­gan­is­ing, and so on – tends to be fuzzy and dis­or­gan­ised com­pared with the struc­tured pro­cesses of, say, in­dus­trial man­u­fac­tur­ing.”</p>
    <p>Prof New­port’s view is that this is a solv­able prob­lem, but most of­fices sim­ply have not got their act to­gether. Sit­ting in an open-plan of­fice al­lows a team to mud­dle through with­out real­is­ing quite how much time they waste on busy­work and co­or­di­na­tion.</p>
    <p>A few knowl­edge jobs, such as IT sup­port, are prop­erly sys­tem­a­tised to al­low fo­cused work with­out end­less ad hoc e-mails. Prof New­port be­lieves that oth­ers will fol­low once we all wise up. Or we may find that cer­tain kinds of knowl­edge work are too un­ruly to sys­tem­a­tise.</p>
    <p>Im­pro­vi­sa­tion will re­main the only mode of work­ing – and, for that, face-to-face con­tact seems es­sen­tial.</p>
    <p>A re­cent sur­vey by Prof Bloom, with col­leagues Jose Maria Bar­rero and Steven Davis, es­ti­mates that re­mote work in the United States will be­come more than four times as com­mon af­ter the pan­demic, in­creas­ing from 5 per cent to 22 per cent of work days. That would be a big swing back to­wards nor­mal­ity – the re­searchers es­ti­mate that last May, over 60 per cent of paid work­ers in the US were op­er­at­ing from home.</p>
    <p>But it would still be a seis­mic fall in de­mand for com­mut­ing and city-cen­tre of­fice space.</p>
    <p>I hope that the cri­sis teaches us how to do pro­duc­tive and ful­fill­ing work from home. But it seems that most of us, most of the time, are des­tined to re­turn to the of­fice in due course. If so, I hope the cri­sis teaches us how to do pro­duc­tive and ful­fill­ing work wher­ever we may be.</p>
