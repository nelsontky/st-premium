    <p>Twenty-one men and women from the un­reg­is­tered lo­cal chap­ter of a se­cre­tive South Korean church have been ar­rested for al­legedly be­ing mem­bers of an un­law­ful so­ci­ety, said the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The nine men aged be­tween 22 and 31, and 12 women aged be­tween 21 and 49 were ar­rested by po­lice of­fi­cers from the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment (CID) on Mon­day, said MHA.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that they had al­legedly reen­gaged in ac­tiv­i­ties con­nected to the un­reg­is­tered lo­cal chap­ter of the Shin­cheonji Church of Je­sus, the Tem­ple of the Taber­na­cle of the Tes­ti­mony, also known as SCJ.</p>
    <p>An­other group of nine women aged be­tween 22 and 52, and two men aged 23 and 36 are as­sist­ing the po­lice with in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Founded by South Korean na­tional Lee Man Hee in 1984, the church has been ac­cused of be­ing a cult in sev­eral coun­tries due to its un­ortho­dox teach­ings, said MHA.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee al­legedly re­gards all other churches and pas­tors as be­long­ing to Satan. He claims to be the Christ in the sec­ond com­ing who will take 144,000 peo­ple to heaven with him on the day of judg­ment, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee has also claimed to be the only per­son who can in­ter­pret the Bi­ble, while SCJ teaches that it is ac­cept­able to use de­ceit and lies if it serves God’s pur­poses, said MHA.</p>
    <p>“It has been ac­cused of in­fil­trat­ing and dis­rupt­ing es­tab­lished Korean churches by us­ing de­cep­tion and se­crecy to trick peo­ple into be­com­ing in­volved with them,” it added.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, five South Korean na­tion­als who held key po­si­tions in the lo­cal chap­ter were repa­tri­ated from Sin­ga­pore and the group’s front en­ti­ties were dis­solved, fol­low­ing MHA’s in­ves­ti­ga­tions that month into the group’s ac­tiv­i­ties, said the min­istry yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MHA had ear­lier in­ves­ti­gated the group for us­ing de­cep­tive re­cruit­ment meth­ods – sim­i­lar to the SCJ in South Korea – to ex­ert a con­trol­ling in­flu­ence over Chris­tian youth and young adults in Sin­ga­pore, and to con­ceal its ex­is­tence from fam­ily mem­bers and</p>
    <p>In spite of the ac­tions taken, the lo­cal SCJ chap­ter has re­sumed its ac­tiv­i­ties covertly, un­der the di­rec­tion of its South Korean par­ent chap­ter... As such, CID is in­ves­ti­gat­ing mem­bers of the lo­cal SCJ chap­ter for po­ten­tial of­fences un­der the So­ci­eties Act.</p>
    <p>MIN­ISTRY OF HOME AF­FAIRS</p>
    <p>non-SCJ con­tacts.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the lo­cal chap­ter were also is­sued warn­ings to cease fur­ther in­volve­ment in the church’s ac­tiv­i­ties, or face fur­ther ac­tion from the au­thor­i­ties, said MHA.</p>
    <p>“In spite of the ac­tions taken, the lo­cal SCJ chap­ter has re­sumed its ac­tiv­i­ties covertly, un­der the di­rec­tion of its South Korean par­ent chap­ter,” it added.</p>
    <p>“As such, CID is in­ves­ti­gat­ing mem­bers of the lo­cal SCJ chap­ter for po­ten­tial of­fences un­der the So­ci­eties Act.”</p>
    <p>Any­one con­victed of be­ing a mem­ber of an un­law­ful so­ci­ety may be jailed for up to three years or fined up to $5,000, or both.</p>
    <p>“MHA will not al­low mem­bers of un­law­ful so­ci­eties or per­sons as­so­ci­ated with them to threaten Sin­ga­pore’s public safety, peace and good or­der,” the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said MHA was look­ing to ban the ac­tiv­i­ties of the lo­cal chap­ter of SCJ, which was at the cen­tre of South</p>
    <p>Korea’s coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam had told reporters that the group, which has fewer than 100 mem­bers here, was be­ing in­ves­ti­gated un­der “na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>He added that while peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore are free to be­lieve in any re­li­gion and to prac­tise it the way that they want, the Gov­ern­ment will step in when “it crosses the line into crim­i­nal­ity or po­ten­tial public se­cu­rity is­sues”.</p>
