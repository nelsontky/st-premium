    <p>BRUS­SELS • The Euro­pean Union has a prob­lem right on its doorstep, and it might just be the ex­cuse it has been wait­ing for to at last speak up.</p>
    <p>When the bloc’s 27 lead­ers in­ter­rupt their sum­mer breaks to hold a con­fer­ence call to­day on the vi­o­lent aftermath of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Be­larus, there is more than just the lat­est anti-demo­cratic out­rage at stake.</p>
    <p>The sus­pected rigged elec­tion in the former Soviet repub­lic gives the EU an op­por­tu­nity to show what sort of role it wants to play in an evolv­ing world.</p>
    <p>Since emerg­ing from a decade of in­ter­nal crises – from euro-area debt chaos to Bri­tain be­com­ing the first coun­try to leave the bloc – the EU has found it­self caught in a strug­gle be­tween the United States and China, and with its old foe Russia still caus­ing trou­ble.</p>
    <p>No longer able, and in some cases will­ing, to pig­gy­back onto Amer­i­can power, the EU wants to strike out on its own.</p>
    <p>“What we have wit­nessed in Be­larus is not ac­cept­able,” Euro­pean</p>
    <p>Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel, who will chair the video con­fer­ence, said in a let­ter to the lead­ers, in­clud­ing Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel and French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron.</p>
    <p>But aside from sym­bol­ism, there is a ceil­ing to what they can do and tough­en­ing the rhetoric re­mains their main ar­se­nal.</p>
    <p>The bloc’s for­eign min­is­ters have al­ready agreed to start work­ing on sanc­tions, though lead­ers may push to ex­pe­dite them.</p>
    <p>The EU’s lead­er­ship be­lieves the</p>
    <p>The bloc lost two points in a Kan­tar sur­vey pub­lished on Sun­day in the Bild am Son­ntag news­pa­per to 36 per cent, while the So­cial Demo­cratic Party (SPD) got a three-point bounce from the Scholz can­di­dacy to 18 per cent. That put the party ahead of the Greens, which fell two points to 16 per cent.</p>
    <p>The du­elling state Cab­i­net meet­ings play into the con­test to re­place Dr Merkel, a wa­ter­shed mo­ment for Europe’s big­gest econ­omy after 15 years of her stew­ard­ship, after the CDU lead­er­ship bat­tle was up­ended by the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>A spe­cial meet­ing to elect a party leader sched­uled for April was scrapped. The CDU said on Mon­day it is standing by plans to hold a scaled-down party con­fer­ence in Stuttgart in De­cem­ber, where del­e­gates will elect the new leader.</p>
    <p>Mr Laschet needs all the help he can get. A pro-busi­ness mod­er­ate, he had been in pole po­si­tion to as­sume the CDU lead­er­ship when he an­nounced his can­di­dacy in Fe­brure­sponse to the sit­u­a­tion has been too muted, in par­tic­u­lar on the role that Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin might play in shoring up Be­laru­sian Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko, said an EU of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>“There should be no out­side in­ter­fer­ence,” Mr Michel made a point of say­ing in his let­ter.</p>
    <p>Eastern Euro­pean coun­tries ge­o­graph­i­cally close to Be­larus such as Poland and the Baltic states pushed for the call, ar­ranged for noon Brus­sels time to­day, but Mr Michel needed lit­tle per­sua­sion. ary. But his po­lit­i­cal star has faded dur­ing the pan­demic, when he was out­shone by Mr Soeder, and Health Min­is­ter Jens Spahn, a CDU con­ser­va­tive who backed Mr Laschet’s bid.</p>
    <p>Mr Soeder and Mr Spahn both won plau­dits as de­ci­sive and ef­fec­tive cri­sis man­agers while Mr Laschet’s more lais­sez-faire ap­proach was badly re­ceived by vot­ers.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal ma­noeu­vring has left Mr Laschet badly hurt. Only 13 per cent of Ger­mans con­sider him a vi­able head of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, the Kan­tar sur­vey shows. That puts him well be­hind other pos­si­ble can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Mr Soeder, who has pushed back on spec­u­la­tion about a bid, won 38 per cent in the same poll, with Mr Scholz at 29 per cent.</p>
    <p>The con­ser­va­tive can­di­date must be de­cided jointly by the CDU and the CSU sis­ter party, though it has tra­di­tion­ally gone to the larger party.</p>
    <p>He and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen started their man­dates at the end of last year with teams that re­flected a new-found fo­cus on in­ter­na­tional is­sues and al­though the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has stymied their plans, that vi­sion has not al­tered.</p>
    <p>The EU’s for­eign pol­icy chief Josep Bor­rell has shown a will­ing­ness in the past to speak his mind, even though he has lim­ited pow­ers.</p>
    <p>“These peace­ful demon­stra­tions had clear de­mands: the re­lease of all un­law­fully de­tained peo­ple, the pros­e­cu­tion of those re­spon­si­ble for po­lice bru­tal­ity, and hold­ing of new pres­i­den­tial elec­tions,” Mr Bor­rell said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“The sheer num­bers clearly show that the Be­laru­sian pop­u­la­tion want change, and want it now. The EU stands by them.”</p>
    <p>The call will be as much about show­ing how the EU can act when it be­lieves a line has been crossed, one EU of­fi­cial said, and its will­ing­ness to di­rectly take on Mr Putin.</p>
    <p>An­other added that while the out­come needs to be more than a mere state­ment, there is a bal­anc­ing act be­tween tak­ing mea­sures that send a strong sig­nal and steps that are counter-pro­duc­tive and make a ne­go­ti­ated so­lu­tion harder.</p>
