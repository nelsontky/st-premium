    <p>BERLIN • Ger­many does not be­lieve that Thai­land’s King has so far breached its ban on con­duct­ing pol­i­tics while liv­ing in the coun­try, a par­lia­men­tary source has said, af­ter law­mak­ers were briefed by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Thai pro­test­ers asked Ger­many on Mon­day to look into whether King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, 68, had con­ducted state busi­ness, such as the sign­ing of royal commands and the An­nual Ex­pen­di­ture Act, while he was on Ger­man soil.</p>
    <p>Ger­many has said it would be un­ac­cept­able for the King to con­duct pol­i­tics in the coun­try and For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas said the Euro­pean power con­tin­ued to look into his be­hav­iour dur­ing so­journs in Bavaria.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a meet­ing of the Bun­destag’s for­eign af­fairs com­mit­tee on Wed­nes­day, the source said the gov­ern­ment had told law­mak­ers that it be­lieves the King is per­mit­ted to make oc­ca­sional de­ci­sions, as long as he does not con­tin­u­ously con­duct busi­ness from Ger­many.</p>
    <p>“The Ger­man gov­ern­ment has taken the view that it is not yet of the opin­ion that the Thai King has con­tin­u­ously con­ducted busi­ness,” the source said.</p>
    <p>When asked about the sta­tus of the King, the gov­ern­ment told the com­mit­tee that he has a visa that al­lows him to live in Ger­many for sev­eral years as a pri­vate per­son and he also en­joys diplo­matic im­mu­nity as a head of state.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s po­lit­i­cal cri­sis has made the King’s pres­ence in Ger­many a chal­lenge for Berlin, but re­vok­ing the visa of a vis­it­ing head of state could cause a ma­jor diplo­matic in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“It is very ob­vi­ous that many find what the Thai King is do­ing very prob­lem­atic, but the gov­ern­ment says it is not yet the prob­lem of con­tin­u­ous gov­ern­ment busi­ness,” the source said.</p>
