    <p>Asia’s worst stock mar­ket is look­ing for a cat­a­lyst to spark a re­cov­ery, and traders are bank­ing on Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte to spell out a plan to fur­ther re­open the econ­omy when he de­liv­ers his an­nual speech to the na­tion to­day.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are also hop­ing for a fis­cal stim­u­lus to help lift the econ­omy out of its deep­est re­ces­sion in more than three decades, ac­cord­ing to an­a­lysts and money man­agers. Govern­ment spend­ing is key to avert­ing a long-last­ing crisis as the coronaviru­s rav­ages the global econ­omy, they said.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors would like to see clar­ity and re­solve,” said Mr Ju­lian Tar­robago, who helps man­age US$2.3 bil­lion (S$3.2 bil­lion) as head of equities at ATR As­set Man­age­ment in Manila.</p>
    <p>“Fis­cal stim­u­lus will help re­duce the like­li­hood that the eco­nomic chal­lenges will evolve into a full­blown fi­nan­cial crisis.”</p>
    <p>While the Philip­pine Stock Ex­change In­dex has ral­lied 30 per cent since the low in March, it is still the worst per­former in Asia this year with a 23 per cent loss. The rally has stalled amid es­ca­lat­ing Covid-19 cases and as in­vestors brace them­selves for a sharper sec­ond-quar­ter earn­ings de­cline.</p>
    <p>Manila is still under quar­an­tine re­stric­tions, in­clud­ing a cur­few, with many busi­nesses shut or with re</p>
    <p>The mar­ket is waiting for the next fis­cal stim­u­lus and a more de­ci­sive Covid re­sponse. You can’t have a strong re­cov­ery with­out th­ese two. The ab­sence of one or the other would mean weak re­cov­ery. duced op­er­a­tions. Mil­lions of jobs have been lost and the govern­ment has al­ready boosted spend­ing to a record to sup­port the econ­omy. Still, Philip­pine fis­cal stim­u­lus is among the low­est in Asia at 4.4 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, ac­cord­ing to May­bank Kim Eng es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s eco­nomic team is push­ing for a stim­u­lus that will cut cor­po­rate taxes and ra­tio­nalise in­cen­tives. Law­mak­ers, mean­while, want to give wage sub­si­dies and cheap loans.</p>
    <p>What mat­ters to mar­kets is that ad­di­tional steps are taken to ar­rest the econ­omy’s slide into a deeper hole, ac­cord­ing to Mr Robert Ramos, head of trust and in­vest­ment group at Rizal Com­mer­cial Bank­ing Cor­po­ra­tion in Manila.</p>
    <p>“We should do some­thing,” he said. “There are ben­e­fits to pro­mot­ing con­sumer spend­ing and hav­ing more funds in the sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Since Congress was re­stored in 1987, the bench­mark PSEi has de­clined two-thirds of the time on the day of the pres­i­dent’s speech. It has gained al­most 60 per cent of the time the day af­ter.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket is waiting for the next fis­cal stim­u­lus and a more de­ci­sive Covid re­sponse,” said Ms Cristina Ulang, head of re­search at First Metro In­vest­ment Cor­po­ra­tion in Manila. “You can’t have a strong re­cov­ery with­out th­ese two. The ab­sence of one or the other would mean weak re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>The peso, which traded at 49.34 per US dol­lar last Fri­day, climbed to its strong­est level since Novem­ber 2016 last week as it ben­e­fited from weak im­ports. The cur­rency will prob­a­bly trade at a range of 48.75 to 49.25 per US dol­lar for the rest of this year, ac­cord­ing to Mr Roland Avante, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Philip­pine Busi­ness Bank.</p>
    <p>Traders in lo­cal bonds, mean­while, will be mind­ful of a stim­u­lus plan that will in­volve more debt sales and a wider bud­get deficit. Philip­pine peso bonds are among the top per­form­ers in emerg­ing mar­kets this year, ad­vanc­ing 15 per cent.</p>
