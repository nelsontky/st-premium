    <p>With tighter bor­der con­trols amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic lim­it­ing the en­try of new for­eign work­ers into Sin­ga­pore, sec­tors de­pen­dent on for­eign labour are be­ing squeezed more than be­fore.</p>
    <p>More than 10 em­ploy­ers in the con­struc­tion and food and bev­er­age (F&B) sec­tors told The Sun­day Times that their man­power costs have gone up sig­nif­i­cantly in the past few months. While some have tried to ad­just and adapt, chal­lenges re­main.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, there were about 420,000 peo­ple em­ployed in the con­struc­tion sec­tor in Septem­ber, based on pre­lim­i­nary es­ti­mates by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>It shrunk by about 17,100 com­pared with the quar­ter from April to June, with mostly for­eign work­ers shed.</p>
    <p>The pool of for­eign labour in Sin­ga­pore has shrunk this year. Ac­cord­ing to MOM data, the coun­try’s to­tal for­eign work­force stood at 1,351,800 in June, com­pared with 1,427,500 last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>No­tably, the num­ber of work per­mit hold­ers in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine and process sec­tors dropped by more than 18,000 – or about 5 per cent – over the same six months. This is largely due to repa­tri­a­tion of work­ers.</p>
    <p>Team­build Con­struc­tion Group ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Johnny Lim said about 5 per cent to 8 per cent of its for­eign work­ers re­quested to re­turn home over the past year.</p>
    <p>For­eign staff ac­count for 85 per cent of the firm’s to­tal strength of 1,000.</p>
    <p>Straits Con­struc­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ken­neth Loo pointed out that the shrink­ing pool of work­ers comes atop the short­age of labour that al­ready ex­isted be­fore the cir­cuit breaker ear­lier this year, given that con­struc­tion out­put was orig­i­nally pro­jected to grow this year.</p>
    <p>IM­PACT ON FIRMS</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion firms said the short­age of work­ers has led to an in­crease in sub­con­trac­tor labour costs by about 20 to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Loo said: “At the end of the day, de­mand ex­ceeds sup­ply. The pool of work­ers is fi­nite, and those con­trac­tors which have more ur­gent needs will pay more.”</p>
    <p>For some, like fac­tory con­struc­tion firm E+HPS, it is nec­es­sary to pass the ris­ing labour costs on to cus­tomers in or­der for it to take on new projects, said its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Jef­frey Koh.</p>
    <p>Labour short­age is also forc­ing some to be more con­ser­va­tive.</p>
    <p>A sub­con­trac­tor firm which de­clined to be iden­ti­fied as it does not want to alarm ex­ist­ing clients, said it has been hold­ing back from tak­ing on new projects as it has only about 60 per cent of its work­ers as com­pared with Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“We’re not at the stage where we’re think­ing of shut­ting down, be­cause we still have a few projects on hand, but if this sit­u­a­tion con­tin­ues and we can­not bring in new work­ers, it will be dif­fi­cult for us to con­tinue op­er­at­ing at the same level,” its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor said.</p>
    <p>AL­TER­NA­TIVES</p>
    <p>For the F&B sec­tor, not be­ing able to bring in new for­eign work­ers to fill the gaps from nat­u­ral work­force at­tri­tion is a con­cern.</p>
    <p>They have turned their fo­cus to Sin­ga­pore­ans, but this too is a chal­lenge. About 1,000 va­can­cies in the sec­tor re­main un­filled, de­spite the soft labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s res­i­dent unemployme­nt rate hit 4.7 per cent in Septem­ber, and there are about 112,500 un­em­ployed Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents – but few seem to be bit­ing, where F&B jobs are con­cerned.</p>
    <p>F&B play­ers, such as restau­rant groups Crys­tal Jade and The Cicheti Group, said lo­cal work­ers usu­ally have higher ex­pec­ta­tions of job scope and pay.</p>
    <p>“Money has never been an is­sue. The is­sue is find­ing a can­di­date who is com­mit­ted and will­ing to make sac­ri­fices,” said Mr Ron­ald Kamiyama, man­ag­ing part­ner of The Cicheti Group.</p>
    <p>The hir­ing sit­u­a­tion is made</p>
    <p>more acute given that the de­pen­dency ra­tio ceil­ing for the ser­vices sec­tor, which F&B falls un­der, will be re­duced to 35 per cent next year. It is cur­rently 38 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drew Tjioe, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Tung Lok Group, said the com­pany is look­ing to hire Sin­ga­pore­ans, to ad­dress its man­power needs as busi­ness has picked up. The restau­rant group, which has 26 out­lets, laid off about 200 work­ers ear­lier this year, of whom 85 per cent were for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>“In the F&B in­dus­try, if you do not have enough staff, your food and ser­vice qual­ity will go down, and that af­fects your busi­ness, your staff, ev­ery­body,” Mr Tjioe said, adding that the group may not re­new the leases of at least two of its restau­rants in the city cen­tre when they ex­pire over the next year.</p>
    <p>“For some places, it makes no com­mer­cial sense to con­tinue be­cause the rent is too high,” he said. Still, the group con­tin­ues to be on the hunt for new spa­ces, he added.</p>
    <p>Dian Xiao Er founder Sa­muel Yik is among the F&B op­er­a­tors who have turned to cen­tral kitchen op­er­a­tions to re­duce their man­power needs at restau­rants. “We do bulk pro­cess­ing of food prod­ucts at the cen­tral kitchen, which re­duces prepa­ra­tion time at the in­di­vid­ual out­lets,” he said.</p>
    <p>For the con­struc­tion sec­tor, how­ever, im­proved pro­cesses like us­ing pre­fab­ri­cated struc­tures can go only so far, said Mr James Yuen, di­rec­tor of Gam­mon Con­struc­tion. “You can min­imise your labour on-site but it can never be zero.”</p>
