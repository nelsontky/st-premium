    <p>Ac­tiveSG mem­bers will face tem­po­rary sus­pen­sion of their mem­ber­ships from to­mor­row if they flout the rules laid out in the na­tional sports move­ment’s amended book­ing pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Users who do not turn up for three book­ings in a month at Ac­tiveSG gyms and swim­ming pools will have their mem­ber­ships sus­pended for two weeks, dur­ing which they will not be al­lowed to book any of Ac­tiveSG’s fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>They will be no­ti­fied via e-mail should their ac­count be sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiveSG said it had ob­served over the past three months that more than 15 per cent of users who pre-booked their slots did not turn up dur­ing their al­lo­cated time slot.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers have been re­quired to book slots for Ac­tiveSG fa­cil­i­ties – with the ex­cep­tion of sta­di­ums – on­line since June 19, when sports venues were re­opened in phase two of the post-cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. The book­ing pol­icy changes will also al­low mem­bers to book gym and pool slots up to three days in ad­vance to en­sure that every­one has a fair shot at us­ing the fa­cil­i­ties. Mem­bers could pre­vi­ously book slots 15 days in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers will not be pe­nalised for no shows if the clo­sure of fa­cil­i­ties is fa­cil­i­tated by Ac­tiveSG due to main­te­nance and other rea­sons. This also ap­plies if Cat 1 weather con­di­tions, which re­fer to light­ning and down­pour, do not al­low for the use of the fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On its web­site, Ac­tiveSG stated that mem­bers will not be re­funded in cases of a light driz­zle, but will be com­pen­sated if they are un­able to</p>
    <p>use the fa­cil­i­ties be­cause of light­ning risk or poor vis­i­bil­ity at the pool.</p>
    <p>Since sports fa­cil­i­ties re­opened in June, Ac­tiveSG has ex­pe­ri­enced high de­mand, with gyms see­ing about 98 per cent of the avail­able slots taken up monthly, while bad­minton courts and pools are at 87 and 61 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In a mass e-mail to mem­bers, Ac­tiveSG chief Sng Hock Lin re­minded mem­bers to com­ply with the mea­sures in place, adding: “Th­ese mea­sures are put in place to en­sure the safety of the com­mu­nity at large, and we will not hes­i­tate to act against er­rant users.”</p>
