    <p>IT STARTS AT HOME</p>
    <p>Home is where our early ed­u­ca­tion starts. It is where we learn about our val­ues.</p>
    <p>MIN­IS­TER OF STATE FOR SO­CIAL AND FAM­ILY DE­VEL­OP­MENT, AND ED­U­CA­TION SUN XUEL­ING</p>
    <p>CHANGE AT­TI­TUDES, BE­HAVIOUR</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has high­lighted the need for a re­view of mat­ters af­fect­ing women and equal­ity – from pro­tect­ing them from fam­ily vi­o­lence to the in­dis­pens­able roles they play as wives, moth­ers, care­givers and more.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, and Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing yes­ter­day said there was an in­crease in re­ports about fam­ily vi­o­lence dur­ing the re­cent cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and that is some­thing “of con­cern to the au­thor­i­ties and to the larger so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>A new in­ter-agency task force that Ms Sun co-chairs was set up ear­lier this year to ad­dress sim­i­lar is­sues.</p>
    <p>She said: “Home is where our early ed­u­ca­tion starts. It is where we learn about our val­ues.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that as a so­ci­ety, we see fam­ily vi­o­lence not as a do­mes­tic mat­ter, but as a mat­ter that we col­lec­tively have to pre­vent, and to pe­nalise if nec­es­sary, so that women vic­tims and other vic­tims of fam­ily vi­o­lence will be able to live hap­pily, mean­ing­fully and be pro­tected, know­ing that their safety is guar­an­teed.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sun spoke yes­ter­day at a vir­tual di­a­logue ti­tled Con­ver­sa­tions on Women De­vel­op­ment, the first in a se­ries of up­com­ing ses­sions that aim to gather feed­back on is­sues that af­fect women at home, in school, the work­place and in the community.</p>
    <p>About 60 par­tic­i­pants f rom youth groups and women’s or­gan­i­sa­tions at­tended the vir­tual ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The ideas and sug­ges­tions gath­ered though th­ese di­a­logues and dis­cus­sions will be tabled as a White Pa­per in Par­lia­ment in the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>The re­view to ad­dress gen­der in­equal­ity will be led by three women po­lit­i­cal of­fice­hold­ers – Ms Sun; Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Community and Youth, and Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling; and Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu Mahzam.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said a par­tic­i­pant at the di­a­logue spoke about how “we need to con­tinue to re­sist per­pet­u­at­ing tra­di­tional gen­der roles that are very harm­ful stereo­types”.</p>
    <p>She said: “If any­thing, Covid-19 has re­ally ex­ac­er­bated this. When push comes to shove, it seems that women have to drop every­thing and grav­i­tate to the home care­giver roles – car­ing for the el­derly, car­ing for fam­ily, in­clud­ing ex­tended fam­ily – but at the same time, also hav­ing to mul­ti­task at work.</p>
    <p>“We had a bit of dis­cus­sion on that and we agreed that col­lec­tively, we need to fun­da­men­tally dis­place at­ti­tudes and be­haviour that prop­a­gate sex­ism. It may not be a con­scious thing but maybe there’s an un­con­scious bias in so do­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Low added that men, too, will also have to play a role in ad­dress­ing this prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Ms Ra­hayu spoke about dis­crim­i­na­tion in work­places and hav­ing ac­cess to flex­i­ble work and leave ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>She said: “We have the leg­is­la­tion and guide­lines in place, but the ac­tual lived re­al­i­ties of the women go­ing through some of th­ese may not nec­es­sar­ily show the out­come that we de­sired, from the changes made over time.”</p>
    <p>There­fore, there is a need to re­view this area, Ms Ra­hayu said.</p>
    <p>In schools, it will be worth ex­am­in­ing how sex­u­al­ity is taught, as well as hav­ing con­ver­sa­tions to change mind­sets, she added.</p>
    <p>The par­tic­i­pants were di­vided into three small groups to fur­ther dis­cuss th­ese top­ics.</p>
    <p>Some ar­eas that came up in the dis­cus­sion in­cluded ex­plor­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for women to be part of a big net­work – a “national ser­vice” equiv­a­lent that all women could go through to­gether.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants from uni­ver­si­ties, in­clud­ing the National Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity (NTU), and other or­gan­i­sa­tions, talked about ways to help stu­dents bet­ter nav­i­gate con­ver­sa­tions on con­sent, re­spect and gen­der roles.</p>
    <p>Ms Gia Lim, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the NTU Stu­dents’ Union, said one is­sue that came up was that sex ed­u­ca­tion should not just be a gen­dered is­sue and “there should not be a dis­crep­ancy be­tween the con­tent that boys and girls learn in school, from the pri­mary to ju­nior col­lege level”.</p>
    <p>She added that poly­tech­nics and uni­ver­si­ties should have greater in­volve­ment in sex ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other par­tic­i­pant, Ms At­tiya Ashraf Ali, vice-pres­i­dent of Men­daki Club, said on the community front, her group dis­cussed the need for a safe space for women to voice their trou­bles and get help.</p>
    <p>Men­daki Club, which or­gan­ises ac­tiv­i­ties and en­gages young mem­bers, is an af­fil­i­ate of the Malay/ Mus­lim self-help group Men­daki.</p>
    <p>She said: “We don’t nec­es­sar­ily have peo­ple who are trained to deal with sex­ual vi­o­lence cases, do­mes­tic abuse, for ex­am­ple, (though) this is some­thing that has made progress re­cently.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, there are more av­enues through which th­ese women are able to get the help that they need... As a community, we can also be more ac­tive in cre­at­ing that safe space.”</p>
    <p>We need to fun­da­men­tally dis­place at­ti­tudes and be­haviour that prop­a­gate sex­ism.</p>
    <p>MIN­IS­TER OF STATE FOR CUL­TURE, COMMUNITY AND YOUTH, AND TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY LOW YEN LING</p>
    <p>LIVED RE­AL­I­TIES DIF­FER</p>
    <p>We have leg­is­la­tion and guide­lines in place, but the ac­tual lived re­al­i­ties of the women go­ing through some of th­ese may not nec­es­sar­ily show the out­come that we de­sired, from the changes made over time.</p>
