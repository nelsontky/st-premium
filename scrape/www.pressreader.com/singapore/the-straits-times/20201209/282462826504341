    <p>Swedish flat-pack fur­ni­ture re­tailer Ikea is turn­ing the page on print­ing its an­nual catalogue, a firm favourite and fix­ture of the finicky fur­ni­ture re­tail scene for nearly 70 years.</p>
    <p>Ikea’s an­nounce­ment on Mon­day that its 2021 catalogue, re­leased in Oc­to­ber, would be its hard-copy swan song has taken home own­ers, de­sign pro­fes­sion­als and fans through­out the world by sur­prise.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Ikea said the phys­i­cal catalogue had suf­fered from wan­ing in­ter­est glob­ally as shop­pers mi­grated to its web­site, apps and so­cial me­dia to make de­ci­sions about buy­ing fur­ni­ture and ac­ces­sories.</p>
    <p>The brochure reached a peak in 2016, when more than 200 mil­lion copies were dis­trib­uted to house­holds and Ikea stores in more than 50 mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Last year, Ikea Sin­ga­pore dis­trib­uted 2.4 mil­lion copies of its 2020 cat­a­logues in Septem­ber, but that num­ber was halved dur­ing the com­pany’s lat­est print run this year for its 2021 cat­a­logues.</p>
    <p>In June, dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, The Straits Times re­ported that more shop­pers were turn­ing to aug­mented re­al­ity (AR) apps pro­vided by fur­ni­ture re­tail­ers such as Castlery and Ikea to help them vi­su­alise how a prod­uct would look in their homes.</p>
    <p>While Ikea says it is plan­ning a smaller printed catalogue – fo­cused on pro­vid­ing i deas for home fur­nish­ing – to be avail­able in stores next year, the fi­nal chap­ter of the 200- to 300-page pub­li­ca­tion has al­ready been penned.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer says its 2021 edi­tion is still avail­able at its stores in Alexan­dra and Tampines, but only while stocks last.</p>
    <p>Here are seven things we love about the Ikea catalogue.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>ONE-STOP CURATION</p>
    <p>Its com­pre­hen­sive styling – cat­e­gorised pre­dictably into es­sen­tials for the liv­ing room, kitchen, bed­room, bath­room, chil­dren’s play area, and new re­leases and ac­ces­sories – is a go-to for any home owner look­ing for ideas in a jiffy.</p>
    <p>Just flick through any sec­tion for the evoca­tive, care­fully styled photos of prod­ucts to fire the imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>TACTILE DIF­FER­ENCE</p>
    <p>One of the strong­est points in Ikea’s hefty brochure, apart from be­ing free, is that it fo­cuses in­tan­gi­ble, neb­u­lous ideas into a pal­pa­ble re­source.</p>
    <p>Its light, low-gloss pages do not bend or crin­kle eas­ily and al­low for easy flip­ping, with some edi­tions, such as the 2018 catalogue, go­ing up to more than 320 pages from cover to cover.</p>
    <p>3 HANDY SIZE</p>
    <p>Up un­til 2018, the catalogue was squar­ish, mea­sur­ing about 18cm by 20cm in size.</p>
    <p>Since last year, the de­sign al­lowed for a big­ger, slightly elon­gated can­vas, mea­sur­ing about 21cm by 27cm.</p>
    <p>Still, it was light and com­fort­able enough to be car­ried around the house or on the go, and was just the right size for shar­ing with other mem­bers of the fam­ily with­out hav­ing to squint to suss out tiny de­tails.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>DISTINCTIV­E TYPOGRAPHY</p>
    <p>Ikea has shown that its stock in trade is more than just sell­ing af­ford­able, flat-pack fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>What it does well is in­spire de­sign ideas through a wellde­signed pub­li­ca­tion, which lever­ages typography to sub­lim­i­nally make one think about the dis­ci­pline that lies at the heart of de­sign.</p>
    <p>Its distinctiv­e font has only three vari­a­tions – heavy block let­ters, medium type and fine print.</p>
    <p>This re­strained, clean ap­proach to page de­sign helps Ikea pro­mote its photos show­ing a packed, rau­cous liv­ing room or rus­tic bed­room in a vis­ually pleas­ing way that seems to work bet­ter in the print medium.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>SCENT OF TREES</p>
    <p>Part of the joy of open­ing a freshly minted Ikea catalogue is the un­mis­tak­able woody fra­grance that wafts out from the pages long after your first peek.</p>
    <p>Think Scan­di­na­vian yew and pine. It re­minds one of a pris­tine school text­book or a crisp novel hot off the press.</p>
    <p>This sen­so­rial con­nec­tion to the phys­i­cal prod­uct is sorely missed in Ikea’s on­line catalogue and its AR-en­hanced it­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>MAILBOX EVENT</p>
    <p>For al­most 46 years in Sin­ga­pore, Ikea has been mail­ing its cat­a­logues to Hous­ing Board (HDB), con­do­minium and landed prop­erty ad­dresses.</p>
    <p>The once-a-year mass mail­ing has not only been a highly an­tic­i­pated mailbox event, but also a great lev­eller of home own­ers.</p>
    <p>Whether one lives in a multi-mil­lion-dol­lar prop­erty or three-room HDB flat, ev­ery home gets just one catalogue to gush over, thumb fever­ishly through or dream about.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>LOOKS GOOD ON ANY TA­BLE</p>
    <p>Prob­a­bly the most-loved as­pect of the catalogue is that it is a de­sign ac­ces­sory in its own right.</p>
    <p>Throw the squar­ish, thick-cut Swedish pub­li­ca­tion on any in­te­rior sur­face – whether on an or­nate tem­pered-glass liv­ing room cof­fee ta­ble or din­ing ta­ble carved out of suar or angsana wood – and see how it en­hances the decor with its pu­rity of lines and stun­ning cover themes.</p>
