    <p>It is not only the pos­si­bil­ity of con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus that has Dr Ro­hit Ti­wari wor­ried. He is also stressed about be­ing able to pay his rent on time this month.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old pae­di­a­tri­cian works at Hindu Rao Hos­pi­tal, a Covid-19-des­ig­nated gov­ern­ment hos­pi­tal in Delhi. And just like his col­leagues and other health­care work­ers at the hos­pi­tal, he has not been paid since June.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal, which is run by the Mu­nic­i­pal Cor­po­ra­tion of Delhi, is go­ing through a funds crunch ex­ac­er­bated by the Covid-19 pan­demic that has hurt rev­enues.</p>
    <p>But funds are also be­ing blocked by the Delhi gov­ern­ment, said North Delhi Mu­nic­i­pal Cor­po­ra­tion Mayor Jai Prakash.</p>
    <p>He said salaries would be sorted out in two weeks.</p>
    <p>The Delhi gov­ern­ment has de­nied that it blocked the funds.</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers who have not been paid since June 18 are go­ing on strike, be­tween 9am and 11am, from to­day. They have been run­ning an on­line cam­paign to high­light their trou­bles.</p>
    <p>“Since the pan­demic (started), salaries have been grossly ir­reg­u­lar. We haven’t got our salary in over 109 days,” said Dr Ti­wari, who has also been on Covid-19-test­ing du­ties.</p>
    <p>“I am on the verge of bor­row­ing again (to pay for rent) from my par­ents, if it (salary) doesn’t come in the next 15 to 20 days. It is ob­vi­ously tough. Ev­ery­one is work­ing and this sit­u­a­tion takes a toll.”</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic rages on in In­dia, health­care work­ers from doc­tors to nurses have been feel­ing the strain.</p>
    <p>Some have had to cope with ir­reg­u­lar salaries or even pay cuts, oth­ers with the high num­ber of in­fected pa­tients which has been se­verely test­ing the health in­fras­truc­ture in the South Asian coun­try.</p>
    <p>In the south­ern state of Ker­ala, 900 ju­nior doc­tors, ap­pointed for three months for Covid-19-re­lated du­ties, threat­ened to re­sign af­ter they were not paid their full salaries on time.</p>
    <p>The Ker­ala gov­ern­ment has now as­sured them that they would get paid in full and on time, a doc­tor said.</p>
    <p>In­dia is the sec­ond-most af­fected coun­try in the world with over 6.5 mil­lion Covid-19 cases. A to­tal of 75,829 cases were recorded in the 24 hours be­fore yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­cov­ery rate re­mains high and the death rate low rel­a­tive to the pop­u­la­tion, but health­care in­fras­truc­ture has come un­der strain. And the ef­fects are show­ing. A re­cent sur­vey of health­care work­ers from across In­dia, which was car­ried out by doc­tors in the south­ern city of Ben­galuru, found that 70 per cent of the 2,008 polled said they ex­pe­ri­enced trauma, and felt pes­simistic and anx­ious.</p>
    <p>Health­care spend­ing in In­dia has in­creased but still re­mains low at 1.28 per cent of the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, one of the low­est in the world.</p>
    <p>There are just 840,130 med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers for a pop­u­la­tion of 1.35 bil­lion. By World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion stan­dards, there should be 2.4 mil­lion doc­tors in a coun­try as pop­u­lous as In­dia.</p>
    <p>“Un­der the cir­cum­stances, I would give so much credit to med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als in In­dia. Some of the best coun­tries in terms of med­i­cal in­fras­truc­ture, like Spain, Italy and the United States, have strug­gled be­cause of Covid-19,” said Mr Arvind Sing­hal, chair­man and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of man­age­ment con­sult­ing firm Technopak.</p>
    <p>“Health­care work­ers at the best of times lead a very, very stress­ful life and are over­bur­dened, work­ing 10 to 12 hours. It (Covid-19) has in­creased the stress. On top of it, a lot of them lost their lives.”</p>
    <p>At least 500 doc­tors, in­clud­ing 62 from Tamil Nadu, have suc­cumbed to Covid-19, ac­cord­ing to the In­dian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion. It has de­manded that doc­tors be treated as “mar­tyrs”, even as they have urged the gov­ern­ment to put to­gether a data­base of other med­i­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>At Delhi’s Saf­dar­jung Hos­pi­tal, doc­tors have been work­ing with­out leave since March.</p>
    <p>“We are all ex­hausted. Since it is our moral re­spon­si­bil­ity, we have to do this and we have stopped think­ing about when this (pan­demic) will be over,” said Dr Manish Ku­mar, pres­i­dent of the res­i­dent doc­tors’ as­so­ci­a­tion at Saf­dar­jung Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Some 16 doc­tors and nurses at the hos­pi­tal have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The fear of catch­ing the in­fec­tion has not gone. But we no longer look at whether the coro­n­avirus fig­ures are go­ing up or down. We just go on with our work,” said Dr Ku­mar.</p>
