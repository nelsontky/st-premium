    <p>HONG KONG Since her per­sonal phone num­ber was posted on­line, Hong Kong pro-democ­racy ac­tivist Carol Ng has re­ceived me­nac­ing calls from strangers and been bom­barded with mes­sages call­ing her a “cock­roach”.</p>
    <p>She is not alone.</p>
    <p>A so­phis­ti­cated and shady web­site called HK Leaks has ramped up its “doxxing” – where peo­ple’s per­sonal de­tails are pub­lished on­line – of Hong Kong po­lit­i­cal ac­tivists, tar­get­ing those it says have bro­ken a sweep­ing new na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Pro­moted by groups linked to the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party and hosted on Rus­sia-based servers, HK Leaks has be­come the most prom­i­nent doxxing site tar­get­ing democ­racy ac­tivists since it first emerged last year.</p>
    <p>The web­site con­tin­ues to op­er­ate de­spite re­quests last year from Hong Kong’s Pri­vacy Com­mis­sioner to re­move all per­sonal pro­files, and it has been re­ferred to the Hong Kong po­lice for in­ves­ti­ga­tion. To date, how­ever, no one has been charged over the doxxing cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Home ad­dresses, so­cial me­dia pro­files and tele­phone num­bers fea­ture along­side de­scrip­tions of in­di­vid­u­als’ al­leged “crimes”.</p>
    <p>The web­site pub­lished in­for­ma­tion on at least 14 peo­ple it claims broke the se­cu­rity law – a charge which car­ries a max­i­mum sen­tence of life in prison – within weeks of the leg­is­la­tion be­ing im­posed by Bei­jing on the city, an Agence FrancePres­se in­ves­ti­ga­tion found.</p>
    <p>“When it first hap­pened, I was very stressed,” said Ms Ng, who chairs the Hong Kong Con­fed­er­a­tion of Trade Unions.</p>
    <p>“I re­ceived some phone calls and mes­sages from ‘blue rib­bon’ peo­ple on Face­book,” she said, re­fer­ring to gov­ern­ment sup­port­ers who adopted the colour be­cause it is as­so­ci­ated with the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery now and then, I re­ceive a mass of What­sApp mes­sages, thou­sands of stick­ers. They call us cock­roaches,” she added.</p>
    <p>“They know they will make peo­ple very scared. But I’m not afraid, be­cause this is my free­dom and I will de­fend my free­dom.”</p>
    <p>HK Leaks has so far posted the per­sonal de­tails of more than 2,000 peo­ple it deems guilty of var­i­ous “mis­deeds” – a ten­fold in­crease in a year.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tered on a Rus­sian server, it is specif­i­cally de­signed to evade pros­e­cu­tion, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>It uses so-called bul­let­proof anony­mous host­ing and reg­u­larly shifts do­mains. On­line traf­fic has in­creased to about 230,000 an­nual unique page views, ac­cord­ing to SiteWorthT­raf­fic.</p>
    <p>The site claims more than 2,000 po­lice and pro-China in­di­vid­u­als have been doxxed by ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent pro-democ­racy lead­ers Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, co-founders of the dis­banded De­mo­sisto party, are on the site un­der a sub­sec­tion named “Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence ri­oter”, while me­dia mogul Jimmy Lai is also listed.</p>
    <p>Also among the 14 al­leged na­tional se­cu­rity law of­fend­ers to have been doxxed are well-known ac­tivists Tony Chung, Nathan Law and Ray Wong.</p>
