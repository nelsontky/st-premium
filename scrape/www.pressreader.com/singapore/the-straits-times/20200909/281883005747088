    <p>A masked and gloved Myan­mar State Coun­sel­lor Aung San Suu Kyi kicked off the rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy’s (NLD) elec­tion cam­paign yes­ter­day by rais­ing its flag in Naypy­itaw.</p>
    <p>In the com­mer­cial capital of Yan­gon, streets that would have been filled with can­vassers were fairly quiet, with restau­rants forced to shut­ter dine-in op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Like South Korea and Sin­ga­pore be­fore it, Myan­mar is now head­ing to­wards na­tional polls in the mid­dle of the coro­n­avirus out­break. The vote is set for Nov 8.</p>
    <p>It is bat­tling a sec­ond wave of the virus that has swelled the coun­try’s to­tal num­ber of cases by more than 100 each day. So fluid is the sit­u­a­tion that the Min­istry of Health and Sports re­leased elec­tion guide­lines only two days be­fore cam­paign­ing be­gan, man­dat­ing that gath­er­ings have no more than 50 peo­ple, who have to stay 1.8m apart from one an­other.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign­ing is banned in Rakhine state and seven Yan­gon town­ships, where res­i­dents are on stay-home or­ders. All visi­tors en­ter­ing the capital of Naypy­itaw need to be tested and quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the 2015 gen­eral elec­tion, when the NLD rode on na­tional op­ti­mism to a land­slide win, an el­e­ment of un­cer­tainty has en­tered this year’s event.</p>
    <p>“This is to­tally dif­fer­ent com­pared to the pre­vi­ous gen­eral elec­tion. So many town­ships in Yan­gon re­gion are locked down and we can’t en­gage with our vot­ers,” said Ms Htoot May, an Up­per House law­maker who is run­ning as an in­de­pen­dent in the race to be the Yan­gon re­gion’s Rakhine eth­nic af­fairs min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple may be too fear­ful to come out to vote, she warned.</p>
    <p>Mr Tharindu Abeyrathna, the Myan­mar pro­gramme of­fi­cer for the Asian Net­work for Free Elec­tions, said other coun­tries were able to pull pan­demic polling off by cre­at­ing trust in the safety of the process and com­mu­ni­cat­ing it well. In Myan­mar, “it’s go­ing to be a huge chal­lenge if the cur­rent out­break con­tin­ues fur­ther”, he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary-backed Union Sol­i­dar­ity and Devel­op­ment Party (USDP) has sug­gested polls be post­poned if con­di­tions worsen.</p>
    <p>Mr Maw Zin, spokesman for the Yan­gon-based Myan­mar In­sti­tute for Democ­racy, said:</p>
    <p>“Five years ago, peo­ple were full of ex­pec­ta­tions. In this cur­rent elec­tion, peo­ple are not very ex­cited.”</p>
    <p>This has only partly to do with the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion. In June, be­fore the cur­rent spike in lo­cal coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sions, the World Bank pro­jected that Myan­mar’s econ­omy could eke out only a 0.5 per cent growth in the fis­cal year end­ing this month. If the pan­demic is pro­tracted, it warned, the econ­omy could con­tract by as much as 2.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Be­yond Covid-19, the coun­try is grap­pling with many chal­lenges. Myan­mar in 2015 was the dar­ling of the Western world, ea­ger to re­ha­bil­i­tate a for­mer junta state and take part in its eco­nomic boom.</p>
    <p>It has since been vil­i­fied for the 2017 purge of Ro­hingya Mus­lims from Rakhine state and now wres­tles with the risks of China’s strate­gic em­brace.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar has also been forced to de­fend it­self at the In­ter­na­tional</p>
    <p>Court of Jus­tice against al­le­ga­tions that it breached the Geno­cide Con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Armed con­flict that con­tin­ues to sim­mer in Rakhine state and the north­ern Shan state may re­sult in the elec­tion be­ing called off in more con­stituen­cies this year than in 2015, said Mr Abeyrathna.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some long-time sup­port­ers of the NLD have been dis­ap­pointed about its slow progress on hu­man rights and un­com­fort­able at how it seems to be get­ting too close to a mil­i­tary which is guar­an­teed a quar­ter of all par­lia­men­tary seats and con­trols vast swathes of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Yet there re­mains no vi­able al­ter­na­tive civil­ian party.</p>
    <p>Dis­il­lu­sion­ment has sparked calls for an elec­tion boy­cott by stu­dent and trade unions. Still, an­a­lysts ex­pect an NLD vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“The ma­jor­ity would say that mil­i­tary rule is some­thing they can­not ac­cept, so they will vote NLD. They un­der­stand that the USDP will have their base, so if they don’t vote, USDP will re­turn,” said Mr Maw Zin.</p>
    <p>Sup­port for the NLD seems to re­main strong. Ms Suu Kyi sparked a run on NLD’s fight­ing pea­cock flag this week by ask­ing sup­port­ers to fly the flag in lieu of gath­er­ing in per­son to show their sup­port. On Face­book, sup­port­ers have al­ready up­dated their pro­file pic­tures with vari­a­tions of the red flag.</p>
    <p>This is an elec­tion that may be strewn with sur­prises, but where the out­come is not in doubt.</p>
