    <p>Some res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ers are dis­ap­pointed that the ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD) re­mis­sion dead­line to sell all units in a project was not fur­ther ex­tended, al­though they have been given an ad­di­tional six months to com­plete con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional tem­po­rary re­lief mea­sures were an­nounced on Thurs­day night for de­vel­op­ers whose con­struc­tion time­lines have been dis­rupted by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While al­most all projects have restarted, there may be dis­rup­tions when work­ers are placed un­der quar­an­tine if they come into close con­tact with a Covid-19 case.</p>
    <p>The fur­ther ex­ten­sion of six ad­di­tional months for project com­ple­tion will help to “mit­i­gate down­stream risks which could po­ten­tially desta­bilise the prop­erty mar­ket”, said Ms Chris­tine Li, Cush­man & Wake­field’s head of business de­vel­op­ment ser­vices for Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tional re­lief mea­sures in­clude a fur­ther six-month ex­ten­sion of the project com­ple­tion pe­riod (PCP) for res­i­den­tial, com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment projects. The PCP has also been ex­tended by up to six months for res­i­den­tial projects un­der the qual­i­fy­ing cer­tifi­cate regime for for­eign de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>An­other step is a fur­ther six­month ex­ten­sion for the com­ple­tion of res­i­den­tial projects in re­la­tion to the re­mis­sion of the ABSD. That means de­vel­op­ers now have six years to com­plete a project in­stead of the usual five years.</p>
    <p>But there was no fur­ther ex­ten­sion of the re­mis­sion con­di­tion time­line to off­load all the units in a project. This was ini­tially five years, but was ex­tended by a fur­ther six months in May.</p>
    <p>Some de­vel­op­ers could face chal­lenges meet­ing such sales dead­lines, given the dis­rup­tions caused</p>
    <p>by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This could be es­pe­cially acute in 2022 and 2023, when the bulk of the units will reach the five-yearplus mark, Ms Li said.</p>
    <p>“It will be es­pe­cially chal­leng­ing for high-end projects where a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of the buy­ers are nonSin­ga­pore­ans,” she added.</p>
    <p>“Due to travel curbs, it may be very dif­fi­cult to reach out to these buy­ers in the short to medium term... which (may) af­fect de­vel­op­ers’ abil­ity to clear all units by the stip­u­lated dead­lines.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment might want to con­sider a more pro­gres­sive ap­proach... (such as to) levy the penalty based on the pro­por­tion of un­sold units.”</p>
    <p>The fur­ther six-month ex­ten­sion un­der the ABSD re­mis­sion rules will give de­vel­op­ers more time to com­plete their projects, but do not change the date of de­liv­ery of va­cant pos­ses­sion stip­u­lated in the sale and pur­chase agree­ment be­tween the de­vel­oper and the buyer, a Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND) spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment is aware of the con­cerns re­gard­ing the liq­ui­dated dam­ages un­der the terms of the sale and pur­chase agree­ment which de­vel­op­ers may in­cur as a re­sult of de­lays due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We are study­ing the con­cerns re­gard­ing the liq­ui­dated dam­ages, and will im­ple­ment ad­di­tional re­lief mea­sures as nec­es­sary, to en­sure that nei­ther party bears an un­due share of the bur­den caused by the pan­demic,” MND said.</p>
    <p>Thurs­day’s ad­di­tional re­lief mea­sures are un­likely to change most</p>
    <p>de­vel­op­ers’ com­mit­ment to build and com­plete the projects as soon as pos­si­ble, be­cause their com­mit­ment to buy­ers in their sale and pur­chase agree­ments re­main the same, said Mr Lee Liat Yeang, senior part­ner at Den­tons Rodyk & David­son’s cor­po­rate real es­tate prac­tice.</p>
    <p>“I sus­pect de­vel­op­ers will be dis­ap­pointed that no ad­di­tional time is given for sales be­yond the ex­tra six months given in May. This could be re­flec­tive of the ap­par­ent strong sales fig­ures in re­cent months,” he added.</p>
    <p>New pri­vate home sales typ­i­cally slow dur­ing the Hun­gry Ghost month, but in Au­gust, they surged for a fourth straight month af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. The buoy­ant re­cov­ery has led to up­ward re­vi­sions by an­a­lysts, with some fore­cast­ing this year’s trans­ac­tions may ex­ceed the 9,912 last year.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lee noted that this sales trend could change in the com­ing months, fol­low­ing new rules pro­hibit­ing de­vel­op­ers from reis­su­ing the op­tion to pur­chase (OTP) mul­ti­ple times to the same buyer for the same unit.</p>
    <p>Ms Tricia Song, head of re­search at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional, be­lieves the ex­ten­sion of the re­lief mea­sures is “eq­ui­table, (and) tar­geted at re­liev­ing the pres­sures of meet­ing dead­lines spe­cific to project com­ple­tion dates”.</p>
    <p>“Show-flats have re­opened and pre-sales since June have al­most caught up with 2019’s pace of pre­sales. The de­lays have been mainly in the com­mence­ment and con­struc­tion of projects,” she said.</p>
    <p>“While the clam­p­down of reis­suance of OTPs could cool the mar­ket by en­cour­ag­ing mar­ginal buy­ers to ex­er­cise more fi­nan­cial dis­ci­pline, we be­lieve there is gen­uine de­mand. Good projects priced sen­si­tively should have no prob­lem sell­ing within the time­line.</p>
    <p>“Not ex­tend­ing the dead­line to sell should en­cour­age de­vel­op­ers to con­tinue to price their projects at­trac­tively, in­stead of hold­ing back.”</p>
    <p>There was also no fur­ther ex­ten­sion for mar­ried Sin­ga­porean cou­ples, who now have one year in­stead of six months to sell their first home to qual­ify for re­mis­sion of ABSD for their sec­ond prop­erty.</p>
    <p>“Buoy­ant HDB (Hous­ing Board) re­sales and the higher HDB re­sale price in­dex in the third quar­ter tes­ti­fied to the re­silience of the mar­ket. Up­graders should have no ex­cuse for their in­abil­ity to sell due to the pan­demic or cir­cuit breaker,” Ms Song said.</p>
