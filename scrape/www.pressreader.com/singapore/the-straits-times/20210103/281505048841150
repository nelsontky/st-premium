    <p>Now that Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture has been added to Unesco’s list of In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity, ex­pect big things to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment is throw­ing its weight be­hind pre­serv­ing this in­valu­able part of Sin­ga­pore life. Pa­tro­n­is­ing one, or more, of the 6,000 stalls in 110 hawker cen­tres around the is­land is a daily rit­ual for many.</p>
    <p>Rare is the Sin­ga­porean who does not have strong opin­ions about the qual­ity and price of hawker food, the clean­li­ness of hawker cen­tres and the fu­ture of hawk­ing.</p>
    <p>Hawker food is in­ex­pen­sive, a re­li­able way to fill empty bel­lies. Some­times, it can even be ex­quis­ite. But hawker cul­ture needs tend­ing to.</p>
    <p>The me­dian age of hawk­ers here is 59. Ev­ery year, vet­eran hawk­ers call it a day. Their recipes and skills van­ish into the sun­set too, be­cause few young peo­ple want those gru­elling 16-hour days in cramped work spa­ces. Many hawk­ers slog so that their chil­dren will not have to fol­low their foot­steps.</p>
    <p>At­tract­ing new blood is cru­cial for pre­serv­ing hawker cul­ture, how­ever. With­out en­ter­pris­ing young men and women, there is no hope of keep­ing the cul­ture alive.</p>
    <p>Aside from pro­grammes to up­grade and re­fur­bish ex­ist­ing hawker cen­tres, and plans to build new ones, the Govern­ment has also come up with schemes to groom new hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>The lat­est ini­tia­tive in­volves pair­ing vet­eran hawk­ers with as­pir­ing ones who will then take over their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>How do these young ones mas­ter skills that have taken a life­time to hone, how do they ac­quire the kind of mus­cle mem­ory needed to turn out con­sis­tently good food?</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has made a com­mit­ment and so must we.</p>
    <p>We need to give these young hawk­ers time, to be more for­giv­ing of lapses. We need to buy food from their stalls, to en­cour­age the hawk­ers when they im­prove, to give con­struc­tive feed­back.</p>
    <p>The learn­ing curve is steep, we must ac­cept that.</p>
    <p>We also need to ac­cept that in time, we will have to pay higher prices for hawker food. Mil­len­ni­als have myr­iad ways to make a liv­ing, why would they choose hard slog and piti­ful pay?</p>
    <p>Oh, and here’s another thing we need to ac­cept: one day, hip­sters will rule in hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The late Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion host An­thony Bour­dain pre­dicted this in 2013, and it is hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>Think of the young guns sling­ing burg­ers, tacos, bak chor meer­a­men hy­brids, old school fish­balls and yong tau foo, Tai­wanese lu rou fan and bento meals. They have added so much di­ver­sity to the hawker scene and they draw younger cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“These dis­tinct schools of young and re­bel­lious older sons and daugh­ters who do this in the fu­ture – that will be the sal­va­tion of street food,” Bour­dain had said then.</p>
    <p>I hope one day to see these re­bel­lious hawk­ers face off against one another, in a yearly fight to name the top five young hawk­ers in Sin­ga­pore. Can you tell I just came off a Food Wars binge on Net­flix?</p>
    <p>These men and women stand be­tween us and a de­press­ing food land­scape of fast-food restau­rants and food­courts.</p>
    <p>We can­not let this hap­pen. Vive la rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
