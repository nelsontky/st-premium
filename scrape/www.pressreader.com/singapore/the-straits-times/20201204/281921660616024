    <p>•</p>
    <p>SEOUL South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in’s sup­port rate hit a record low as tur­moil over the fate of the coun­try’s top pros­e­cu­tor rocked his gov­ern­ment, in a wor­ri­some sign as he en­ters the lat­ter stages of his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon’s ap­proval rat­ing fell to 37.4 per cent, down from 43.8 per cent a week ago, a track­ing sur­vey from Real­me­ter re­leased yes­ter­day showed.</p>
    <p>The drop comes as his gov­ern­ment has tried to oust Mr Yoon Seok-youl from of­fice af­ter the chief pros­e­cu­tor launched probes into sus­pected graft by mem­bers of Mr Moon’s in­ner cir­cle.</p>
    <p>The poll also showed trou­bling signs for Mr Moon’s pro­gres­sive camp, which saw its sup­port rate slip and be over­taken for the first time in about four months by the con­ser­va­tive fac­tion.</p>
    <p>This comes as Mr Moon’s sin­gle, five-year term ends in 2022 and con­ser­va­tives are look­ing to take back the pres­i­den­tial Blue House.</p>
    <p>Mr Yoon has drawn the ire of Jus­tice Min­is­ter Choo Mi-ae, who has ac­cused him of thwart­ing the Pres­i­dent’s at­tempts at re­form.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tor-gen­eral has launched a probe into sus­pected ne­po­tism by Ms Choo, look­ing into whether she in­ap­pro­pri­ately helped her son ex­tend his med­i­cal leave from mil­i­tary ser­vice – a charge the Jus­tice Min­is­ter de­nies.</p>
    <p>The poll showed a sharp drop in sup­port among lib­eral and swing vot­ers, which could make it dif­fi­cult for mem­bers of Mr Moon’s pro­gres­sive camp to ride his coat­tails in a pres­i­den­tial race.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic ap­pears to be sid­ing with Mr Yoon in the fight, with the long-time pros­e­cu­tor emerg­ing in re­cent weeks as a top con­tender for the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>The fight has come as Mr Moon faces crit­i­cism from many in the pub­lic for what they see as a fail­ure to de­liver on his pledges to cool a red-hot real es­tate mar­ket and de­crease in­come in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­ity of pros­e­cu­tors has been a sore spot in South Korea for years, and lim­it­ing pros­e­cu­tors’ in­ves­tiga­tive pow­ers has been one of Mr Moon’s key pol­icy ob­jec­tives since tak­ing of­fice in May 2017.</p>
    <p>Although the pros­e­cu­tors pledge in­de­pen­dence, they have faced crit­i­cism from the left and right for us­ing pros­e­cu­to­rial pow­ers for po­lit­i­cal pur­poses and for pro­tect­ing the priv­i­leged.</p>
    <p>Mr Yoon is fac­ing a dis­ci­plinary hear­ing to­day, af­ter win­ning an in­junc­tion from a Seoul court this week that blocked his sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>He has re­quested that the hear­ing be de­layed.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the com­mit­tee’s de­ci­sion, Mr Moon will de­cide on dis­ci­plinary ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Yoon was hand­picked by the Pres­i­dent as the coun­try’s top pros­e­cu­tor last year, with a man­date to make good on Mr Moon’s pledges to clean up the gov­ern­ment and go af­ter the most pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>But soon af­ter tak­ing of­fice, Mr Yoon fo­cused his at­ten­tion on Mr Moon’s pick at that time to lead the Jus­tice Min­istry – Mr Cho Kuk.</p>
    <p>A close aide to Mr Moon, Mr Cho was in­dicted on a dozen charges, in­clud­ing bribery.</p>
    <p>Mr Cho, who was forced from of­fice, has de­nied the charges.</p>
    <p>The scan­dal sent Mr Moon’s sup­port rate to its pre­vi­ous all-time low.</p>
