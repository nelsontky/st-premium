    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • The Toronto Rap­tors have got the bit be­tween their teeth.</p>
    <p>Af­ter go­ing down 2-0 to the Mil­wau­kee Bucks in the East­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals last year, they reeled off four suc­ces­sive vic­to­ries to ad­vance and sub­se­quently l anded their first Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Toronto are at the half­way point of a sim­i­lar re­cov­ery af­ter beat­ing the Bos­ton Celtics 100-93 on Sat­ur­day to knot their semi-fi­nal se­ries at 2-2.</p>
    <p>Pas­cal Si­akam paced the cham­pi­ons with 23 points as the Rap­tors seek to gain the up­per hand in the best-of-seven se­ries for the first time in Game 5 to­day and mo­men­tum is on their side, just like last sum­mer.</p>
    <p>“We can al­ways get to an­other level. I feel like we can al­ways do that and ob­vi­ously ev­ery­one click­ing at the right time, and once we have that, we’re a pretty spe­cial team,” he said. “Feels like we’re start­ing over. It’s a great team we’re play­ing against. It’s not go­ing to be easy. We know that.”</p>
    <p>Team­mate Kyle Lowry, who con­trib­uted 22 points, added: “We just con­tinue to fo­cus on ev­ery pos­ses­sion, ev­ery game. We know how tough those guys are. We’ve just got to con­tinue to make it tough on those guys.”</p>
    <p>Just like in Game 3, the Rap­tors’ de­fence again shone at Dis­ney World, re­strict­ing their op­po­nents to seven for 35 from three-point range.</p>
    <p>For­ward Jaylen Brown, in par­tic­u­lar, had a mis­er­able night, miss­ing his first nine at­tempts from be­hind the arc to fin­ish two for 11, and four for 18 and 14 points over­all.</p>
    <p>His team­mates were equally poor from long range, with Jayson Ta­tum – whose 24-point dis­play led all scor­ers – Kemba Walker and Mar­cus Smart go­ing one for six.</p>
    <p>Brown later de­fended his per­for­mance, telling MassLive.com that he was “a good shooter” and in­sist­ing Bos­ton, who have not ad­vanced to the NBA Fi­nals since 2010, could not be counted out just yet.</p>
    <p>“It’s make or break time, 2-2, the se­ries is tied up,” he said. “We got to bounce back and be ready to fight. That’s what it comes down to, fight. We have to be ready to fight for our lives next game and keep play­ing good bas­ket­ball.”</p>
    <p>In the West, the Den­ver Nuggets, who were trounced in the opener, came back with a vengeance, pow­er­ing to a 110-101 vic­tory over the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers to even their semi-fi­nal se­ries at 1-1.</p>
    <p>They had a blis­ter­ing first half dur­ing which their lead was as many as 23 points, and Ja­mal Mur­ray, who had a game-high 27 points, claimed his team showed their true colours.</p>
    <p>“Game 1, we were tired. I hate to ad­mit it, but we were tired,” said the guard. “We came out sloppy, ex­hausted, fa­tigued. We didn’t make any shots, we didn’t get back on de­fence. Tonight, we just upped the en­ergy and that’s all it took to win.”</p>
    <p>Game 3 takes place to­day.</p>
