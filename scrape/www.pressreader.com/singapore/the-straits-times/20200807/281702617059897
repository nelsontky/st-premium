    <p>SYD­NEY • Mel­bourne be­gan the first day of a six-week to­tal lock­down yes­ter­day, with the clo­sure of most shops and busi­nesses rais­ing new fears of food short­ages, as the au­thor­i­ties bat­tle a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Shops were shut and streets were de­serted in the city of about five mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne is Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-largest city and the cap­i­tal of Vic­to­ria state, which re­ported 471 new Covid-19 cases and eight deaths in the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has now recorded about 20,000 Covid-19 cases and 255 fa­tal­i­ties, still far fewer than many other de­vel­oped na­tions.</p>
    <p>But the Vic­to­rian out­break threat­ens to spill into other states.</p>
    <p>New South Wales re­ported 12 new coro­n­avirus cases on Wed­nes­day, tak­ing the na­tional tally to 483.</p>
    <p>There were no cases re­ported in other states and ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“We’ve flat­tened that curve once, we’ll flatten that curve again,” Health Min­is­ter Greg Hunt told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel An­drews urged Mel­bourne res­i­dents, who have al­ready en­dured weeks of a less se­vere lock­down, to stay calm amid a surge in de­mand at su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“There’s no need for peo­ple to be try­ing to stock­pile months and months of food,” Mr An­drews told re­porters in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Abat­toirs are one of the few busi­nesses al­lowed to stay open in Mel­bourne, though with a re­duced work­force, un­der the stage four lock­down which took ef­fect at mid­night on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“We have tried to get that bal­ance be­tween re­duc­ing the amount of move­ment, there­fore re­duc­ing the num­ber of cases, but not com­pro­mis­ing what you need be­ing on the su­per­mar­ket shelves,” Mr An­drews added.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents are still al­lowed to go out dur­ing the day for ex­er­cise and food, or for work if their busi­ness is deemed es­sen­tial.</p>
    <p>While most res­i­dents ap­pear to have heeded warn­ings and are keen for the lock­down to work, the mea­sures have been op­posed by some vo­cal crit­ics.</p>
    <p>Fore­cast na­tional peak un­em­ploy­ment was re­vised up­wards to about 10 per cent due to Vic­to­ria’s re-im­po­si­tion of re­stric­tions, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said.</p>
    <p>Count­ing those work­ers on Aus­tralia’s wage sub­sidy scheme, Mr Mor­ri­son said ef­fec­tive un­em­ploy­ment would be closer to 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>“These mea­sures will have a very sig­nif­i­cant cost, and it will im­pact the re­cov­ery path,” he told re­porters in Can­berra.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son warned that the lat­est lock­down would cost the Aus­tralian econ­omy up to US$9 bil­lion (S$12.3 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>He also said ad­di­tional men­tal health sup­port would be rolled out for Aus­tralians “work­ing through the stress, and anx­i­ety and strain” of lock­downs.</p>
    <p>“Not be­ing able to con­nect with friends and loved ones, con­cerns about em­ploy­ment, all of this takes a toll,” Mr Mor­ri­son said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia had pre­vi­ously fore­cast un­em­ploy­ment would hit a high of 9.25 per cent this year, as the econ­omy en­dures its first re­ces­sion in three decades.</p>
    <p>Af­ter clos­ing its in­ter­na­tional bor­ders early, lock­ing down cities and launch­ing a cam­paign of mass virus test­ing, Aus­tralia had re­opened in June with daily cases in the sin­gle digit.</p>
    <p>But hid­den trans­mis­sions among staff at quar­an­tine cen­tres led to wider com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions i n Vic­to­ria, which has recorded triple-digit new cases for weeks.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria now has the bulk of Aus­tralia’s in­fec­tions, with more than 13,000 re­ported cases.</p>
    <p>It re­ported a daily high of 725 new cases and 15 deaths on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Coro­n­avirus cases in Ja­pan are spread­ing from ma­jor metropoli­tan hot spots to ru­ral re­gions, amid fears that do­mes­tic travel dur­ing the sum­mer hol­i­days will spread the virus even fur­ther.</p>
    <p>NO NEED TO STOCK­PILE FOOD</p>
    <p>There’s no need for peo­ple to be try­ing to stock­pile months and months of food... We have tried to get that bal­ance be­tween re­duc­ing the amount of move­ment, there­fore re­duc­ing the num­ber of cases, but not com­pro­mis­ing what you need be­ing on the ’’ su­per­mar­ket shelves.
