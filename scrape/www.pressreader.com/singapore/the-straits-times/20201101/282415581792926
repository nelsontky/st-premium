    <p>SHUGGIE BAIN</p>
    <p>By Dou­glas Stu­art Pi­cador/Pa­per­back/433 pages/ $29.95/ Avail­able at bit.ly/Shug­gieBain_DS</p>
    <p>When Hugh “Shuggie” Bain is five years old, his drunk mother Agnes calmly sets fire to the cur­tains in their room and clings to him as they burn, un­til his fa­ther rushes in to put it out.</p>
    <p>Scot­tish-Amer­i­can au­thor Dou­glas Stu­art’s de­but is a re­lent­lessly grim por­trait of work­ing­class life in 1980s Glas­gow, Scot­land, a city gut­ted by thenBri­tish premier Mar­garet Thatcher’s Aus­ter­ity poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Stu­art, 44, who works in fash­ion de­sign in New York, grew up on a Glas­gow pub­lic hous­ing es­tate and, like Shuggie, was the youngest son of an al­co­holic sin­gle mother. She died when he was 16.</p>
    <p>Of all the nov­els on the Booker short­list, his is the most drain­ing read. It is a faith­ful and un­flinch­ing record of the grind of poverty and the suck and drag of ad­dic­tion, punc­tu­ated by sud­den, dread­ful flares of vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the fire, Shuggie’s fam­ily move from the cramped flat they share with Agnes’ par­ents in Sighthill to Pit­head, a squalid min­ing town where un­em­ploy­ment is rife, neigh­bours are rou­tinely vi­cious and no­body bats an eye­lid at the ram­pant do­mes­tic and sex­ual abuse.</p>
    <p>The move is a night­mare for Shuggie, a sweet, sen­si­tive boy who likes dolls and does not move like the other boys.</p>
    <p>His dif­fer­ence marks him out from the be­gin­ning as a tar­get of ho­mo­pho­bia. He has no lan­guage for what he is ex­cept the in­sults thrown at him.</p>
    <p>Though he is the ti­tle char­ac­ter, he of­ten re­mains on the pe­riph­ery of the novel, which de­votes many pages to flesh­ing out the rest of his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>There is his fa­ther Big Shug, a phi­lan­der­ing, brutish cab driver; his sis­ter Cather­ine, who mar­ries young i n her des­per­a­tion to es­cape her fam­ily; and his brother Leek, who quashes his artist dreams be­neath the har­dened shell of sur­vival.</p>
    <p>But the core of the novel, the vor­tex it inex­orably cir­cles, is Agnes.</p>
    <p>Beau­ti­ful, full of big dreams and drawn to self-de­struc­tion, she aban­dons her mild Catholic hus­band to elope with Shug, then deals with his cheat­ing by hit­ting the bot­tle.</p>
    <p>The novel shows both how fiercely she loves her child and how fright­en­ingly easy it is for her al­co­holism to tear that love to shreds.</p>
    <p>Stu­art ren­ders the bleak neigh­bour­hoods of Sighthill and Pit­head and its in­hab­i­tants with a clear, lov­ing eye, with par­tic­u­lar at­ten­tion to the colour of Glaswe­gian speech, al­though</p>
    <p>Agnes and Shuggie af­fect the Queen’s English to dis­tance them­selves.</p>
    <p>The writ­ing can veer to­wards the melo­dra­matic, es­pe­cially in Stu­art’s ten­dency to use pe­ri­ods to break up speech: “Let Jamesy McAven­nie hear. That his. Wife died on the. Road.”</p>
    <p>The nar­ra­tive is so mired in mis­ery that it is of­ten a litany of suf­fer­ing, an un­end­ing cy­cle of nasty gos­sip, ruth­less bul­ly­ing and at­tempts to sur­face from ad­dic­tion only to slip back un­der again.</p>
    <p>Yet there is no deny­ing the power of its tes­ta­ment, its sheer de­ter­mi­na­tion to shine a light on of­ten-over­looked lives in all their facets.</p>
    <p>For all its heav­i­ness, it ends on a mo­ment of sub­lime light­ness, as Shuggie, shrug­ging off the weight of his cir­cum­stances for a sec­ond, al­lows him­self to dance.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: The End Of Eddy by Edouard Louis, trans­lated by Michael Lucey (Pi­cador, 2014, trans­lated 2017, $27.95, avail­able from bit.ly/Endof Ed­dy_EL), a grim, au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal novel about grow­ing up queer be­low the poverty line in ru­ral France.</p>
