    <p>Ten new coro­n­avirus cases were con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,840.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded four in­fec­tions in worker dor­mi­to­ries and six im­ported cases who had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon their ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>There were no new cases in the com­mu­nity. The last time there were no com­mu­nity in­fec­tions was on Sept 27.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 39 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing one in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 150 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Last night, MOH said three of the six im­ported pa­tients had ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded a 37-year-old man, who is a work pass holder, and two work per­mit hold­ers – a 26 year-old man and a 26-year-old woman.</p>
    <p>An­other i mported case, a 23-year-old man who is a Chi­nese work per­mit holder, ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from France, while a 27-year-old woman, also a work per­mit holder, had trav­elled from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The sixth i mported case is a 35-year-old In­dian na­tional, a short-term visit pass holder who had ar­rived from the United King­dom. MOH said the man’s spouse is Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>All six im­ported pa­tients tested pos­i­tive for the virus on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>They had all been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Of the four pa­tients in the dor­mi­to­ries, one had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as a con­tact of pre­vi­ous cases and had al­ready been quar­an­tined. He was tested dur­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing three dor­mi­tory cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing such as bi-weekly ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>MOH added that two clus­ters have been closed as they have not had new cases linked to them for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>The first, S11 Dor­mi­tory @ Pung­gol, is lo­cated at 2 Sele­tar North Link, while the other clus­ter was linked to con­struc­tion sites at 9 Pe­nang Road and 8 Loyang Cres­cent.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 12 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,609 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
