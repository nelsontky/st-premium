    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s han­dling of the Covid-19 out­break and its strong events in­fra­struc­ture were likely fac­tors i n the coun­try be­ing picked to host the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s (WEF) an­nual meet­ing next May, ob­servers said.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine said WEF or­gan­is­ers can see that Sin­ga­pore has “got good con­trol of the dis­ease”.</p>
    <p>He noted that the Gov­ern­ment’s “only real slip-up” was in un­der­es­ti­mat­ing the virus’ im­pact on mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore has shown that it’s pre­pared to adapt and be nim­ble – when the sit­u­a­tion changes, it is pre­pared to be proac­tive in mod­i­fy­ing re­sponses,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The or­gan­is­ers know Sin­ga­pore is go­ing to be a bit more flex­i­ble and in­no­va­tive. They prob­a­bly think if any­one can make this con­fer­ence hap­pen, it’s Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The WEF on Mon­day said its pri­or­ity is to safe­guard health and safety, and that Sin­ga­pore was best placed to host the gath­er­ing in the light of the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion world­wide.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try said the de­ci­sion to re­lo­cate the venue from Switzer­land re­flected con­fi­dence in its man­age­ment of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the Repub­lic’s demon­strated com­pe­tence in han­dling Covid-19, its phys­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture also ac­com­mo­dates a tra­di­tion­ally hec­tic event packed with 15 to 20 meet­ings daily, said Dr Jeremy Lim from the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>“The ease of mov­ing around is im­por­tant, so what also makes Sin­ga­pore at­trac­tive here is that it’s a small coun­try,” he said.</p>
    <p>Other con­sid­er­a­tions, such as the coun­try’s high level of hos­pi­tal­ity and so­phis­ti­cated telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions net­works would also have played a part, Dr Lim added.</p>
    <p>“There are other cities that have done pretty well in man­ag­ing Covid-19. But if you think about what makes a great meet­ing des­ti­na­tion for very im­por­tant peo­ple, and what makes a safe place in this Covid-19 world, I think Sin­ga­pore is a very log­i­cal choice,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben­jamin Chi­ang, Asean gov­ern­ment and pub­lic sec­tor leader at EY, pointed to the Gov­ern­ment’s de­lib­er­ate ef­forts to re­vive the events sec­tor. He cited tech­nol­ogy-driven ini­tia­tives such as con­tact­less bor­der en­try points, re­al­time crowd con­trol by video, and ro­bots to au­to­mate san­i­ta­tion and hy­giene mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Chi­ang, along with events in­dus­try pro­fes­sion­als, also said re­cent pi­lots of large-scale events have helped Sin­ga­pore fine-tune and op­ti­mise the over­all ex­pe­ri­ence for vis­it­ing del­e­gates.</p>
    <p>Added Dr Chong Ja Ian from NUS’ po­lit­i­cal sci­ence depart­ment: “Sin­ga­pore is ge­o­graph­i­cally con­ve­nient and gen­er­ally po­lit­i­cally non-of­fen­sive to ma­jor pow­ers as well as ma­jor cor­po­ra­tions. These ac­tors prob­a­bly like the fact that there will be lit­tle vis­i­ble dis­sent as well.”</p>
