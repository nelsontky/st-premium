    <p>OR­LANDO • After play­ing their first Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-off game in over seven years, the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers will have to wait un­til at least Thurs­day for their first post-sea­son re­turn win.</p>
    <p>Le­Bron James, him­self ab­sent from the play-offs since mov­ing to the Lak­ers in 2018, had 23 points, 17 re­bounds and a post-sea­son­high 16 as­sists against the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Yet, be­com­ing the first player ever to go over 20-15-15 in the play­offs was not enough as the top seeds lost 100-93 in Game 1 of their West­ern Con­fer­ence opener in the NBA bub­ble near Or­lando.</p>
    <p>Port­land led by as many as 16 in the first quar­ter and star point guard Damian Lil­lard fin­ished with a game-high 34 points.</p>
    <p>C.J. McCol­lum had 21 points while Jusuf Nur­kic con­trib­uted 16 points and 15 re­bounds. Carmelo An­thony added 11 points and 10 re­bounds.</p>
    <p>Has­san White­side col­lected five blocks, in­clud­ing one on James with the score tied at 89-89 in the fourth quar­ter, to go with seven points and eight re­bounds.</p>
    <p>Port­land, who had to win their play-in game to se­cure the West’s fi­nal play-off spot, have now won eight of their last 10 matches.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery game since we’ve been here has been a play-off game. So that pre­pared us for a game like this,” Lil­lard, named the bub­ble’s Most Valu­able Player for his per­for­mances in Port­land’s eight seed­ing games, told ESPN.</p>
    <p>In the Lak­ers’ eight pre­vi­ous games, they made just 30.3 per cent of their shots be­yond the arc, the worst of the 22 teams in­vited to Or­lando. And their shoot­ing woes did not im­prove against the league’s third-worst de­fence in the bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les made just five of 32 three-point­ers – com­pared to 13 of 34 for Port­land – and shot 35.1 per cent over­all.</p>
    <p>“Re­main pa­tient,” said Lak­ers coach Frank Vo­gel of their plans to turn things around. “Trust the per­cent­ages, law of av­er­ages and con­tinue to work with our guys on iden­ti­fy­ing the right shots and re­main­ing calm.”</p>
    <p>Lak­ers for­ward An­thony Davis had 28 points and 11 boards while Kyle Kuzma chipped in with 14 points.</p>
    <p>“No frus­tra­tion, be­cause t he game is the game, and we came here with a mind­set to win,” James said. “We didn’t take care of busi­ness, but we got an­other op­por­tu­nity on Thurs­day to even the se­ries and that’s my only mind­set.</p>
    <p>“I’m gonna go back to the ho­tel, watch some film tonight, lock in with the team to­mor­row, pre­pare be­fore the game on Thurs­day and get ready to play.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Tues­day, top over­all seeds Mil­wau­kee Bucks also lost to the Or­lando Magic.</p>
    <p>This is just the se­cond time in NBA his­tory that both the West­ern and East­ern Con­fer­ence top seeds dropped Game 1 against the eighth seeds after 2003, when the Detroit Pis­tons and San An­to­nio Spurs fell to Or­lando and Phoenix Suns re­spec­tively.</p>
