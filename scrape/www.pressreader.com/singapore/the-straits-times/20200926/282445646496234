    <p>LONDON • Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has hinted that Vic­tor Lindelof will be the fall guy, with Eric Bailly set to take the Swede’s place at the heart of Manch­ester United’s de­fence for to­day’s English Premier League visit to Brighton.</p>
    <p>The Red Dev­ils have en­dured a storm of crit­i­cism since last weekend’s 3-1 open­ing home de­feat by Crys­tal Palace, with pun­dits slam­ming the in­de­ci­sive­ness at the back and lack of trans­fer ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Lindelof was par­tic­u­larly shaky in that game, con­ced­ing a penalty and was also too eas­ily brushed aside by Wil­fried Zaha in the leadup to the Ea­gles’ third goal.</p>
    <p>With Bailly start­ing along­side Harry Maguire as United kept a clean sheet en route to a 3-0 thir­dround League Cup win over Cham­pi­onship side Lu­ton in mid­week, Sol­sk­jaer i ntends to keep faith with that cen­tre-back part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>At his pre-match vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, he said: “Our de­fen­sive record shows that with Eric and Harry how good a part­ner­ship they were, but also the whole team de­fend­ing as a team.”</p>
    <p>Bailly started just once in the Premier League last sea­son ow­ing to a long-term in­jury and with just 25 top-flight ap­pear­ances in the two sea­sons be­fore that, his record does not stand up to scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>But de­spite his in­jury-prone tag, the Ivory Coast in­ter­na­tional has qual­i­ties that Lindelof lacks, such as pace, and is a more nat­u­ral part­ner for the less mo­bile Maguire, some­thing Sol­sk­jaer ac­knowl­edges.</p>
    <p>“Eric now is fit again and that’s a big, big bonus,” the Nor­we­gian said.</p>
    <p>He also sought to quell the anger of fans, who have been vo­cal on so­cial me­dia about United’s fail­ure to add to their squad ex­cept for the sign­ing of Nether­lands mid­fielder Donny van de Beek.</p>
    <p>With the trans­fer win­dow clos­ing next week, sup­port­ers are wor­ried as there ap­pears to be no progress in talks for Borus­sia Dort­mund for­ward Jadon San­cho, while the club are said to be hag­gling with Porto over the price for Brazil de­fender Alex Telles.</p>
    <p>On the po­ten­tial of new faces at the club, Sol­sk­jaer said: “In foot­ball, you can’t pre­dict too much. For me, I’m just work­ing on get­ting bet­ter. My fo­cus is solely on the (Brighton) game, I can’t be think­ing any other way. We need points and then we can talk again.”</p>
