    <p>DAL­LAS • Boe­ing’s 737 Max made its first pub­lic demon­stra­tion flight yes­ter­day with mem­bers of the me­dia since be­ing grounded over fa­tal crashes, as one of its big­gest cus­tomers, Amer­i­can Airlines, seeks to prove it is safe for pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The flight from the air­line’s base in Dal­las, Texas, to Tulsa, Ok­la­homa, comes weeks be­fore the air­line’s first com­mer­cial flight on Dec 29, and is part of a pub­lic re­la­tions ef­fort by the plane­maker and airlines to re­ha­bil­i­tate the jet’s image fol­low­ing a record 20-month ban.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing said it had no com­ment on the Amer­i­can flight and that it would not have staff aboard. The plane­maker said airlines will take a di­rect role in demon­strat­ing to pas­sen­gers that the 737 Max is safe.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing’s best-sell­ing jet was grounded world­wide in March last year af­ter two crashes five months apart killed a com­bined 346 peo­ple, mark­ing the in­dus­try’s worst safety cri­sis in decades and a huge set­back for the United States aviation reg­u­la­tory lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s flight marks the first time any­one be­sides reg­u­la­tors and in­dus­try per­son­nel have flown on the Max since the ground­ing. Last month, the US Fed­eral Aviation Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FAA) cleared it to fly.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s Gol Lin­has Aereas In­teligentes is plan­ning a sim­i­lar high-pro­file event for the re­designed Max this month, with cau­tious hopes to fly its first com­mer­cial flights as soon as next week, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive said.</p>
    <p>A smooth re­turn to ser­vice for the Max is seen as crit­i­cal for Boe­ing’s rep­u­ta­tion and fi­nances.</p>
    <p>The US plane­maker is brac­ing it­self for in­tense public­ity from even rou­tine glitches by man­ning a 24-hour “sit­u­a­tion room” to mon­i­tor ev­ery Max flight glob­ally, and has briefed some in­dus­try com­men­ta­tors on de­tails of the re­turn to ser­vice, in­dus­try sources said.</p>
    <p>Airlines and leas­ing com­pa­nies have spent hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars buy­ing the lat­est up­grade of the 737, the world’s most-sold air­craft.</p>
    <p>But fam­i­lies of some of the crash vic­tims in In­done­sia and Ethiopia have protested against the re­turn to ser­vice, say­ing it is pre­ma­ture be­fore a fi­nal in­ves­tiga­tive re­port on the sec­ond crash has been re­leased.</p>
    <p>The PR ef­forts are de­signed to high­light soft­ware and train­ing up­grades which the FAA has said re­move any doubt about the plane’s safety.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing toned down its orig­i­nal plans for the plane’s even­tual re­turn as the cri­sis dragged on longer than ex­ec­u­tives ex­pected, scrap­ping a high-pro­file public­ity campaign which had in­cluded a cer­e­mony in the Seat­tle area and a tour us­ing an Oman Air 737 Max, in­dus­try sources said.</p>
    <p>A Boe­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in a vote of con­fi­dence, airlines are step­ping in to place or­ders for the Max, with Alaska Airlines agree­ing to lease ex­tra Max jets last week, and Ire­land’s Ryanair ex­pected to top up Max or­ders as early as this week.</p>
