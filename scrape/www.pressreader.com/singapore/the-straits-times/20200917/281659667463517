    <p>How ef­fec­tive spend­ing cred­its will be in boost­ing the tourism sec­tor will de­pend on a range of fac­tors, in­clud­ing the will­ing­ness of op­er­a­tors to col­lab­o­rate and come up with new ideas, ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>As busi­nesses clam­our to take ad­van­tage of the $100 Sin­gapoRedis­cover vouch­ers to be is­sued to all adult Sin­ga­pore­ans in De­cem­ber, some are ex­press­ing con­cern that the ben­e­fits will not be evenly spread.</p>
    <p>Dr Kevin Cheong, chair­man of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions, said re­demp­tions may skew towards al­ready pop­u­lar op­er­a­tors, and “one sin­gle ex­pe­ri­ence might con­sume all the cred­its in one fam­ily”.</p>
    <p>He urged ho­tels, at­trac­tions and tour op­er­a­tors to work to­gether to cre­ate holis­tic stay­ca­tion pack­ages and of­fer­ings that help en­sure the cred­its are spread across all mem­bers of the tourism ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>While food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments and re­tail­ers are part of the $45 mil­lion Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers mar­ket­ing cam­paign, the vouch­ers will be re­deemable only at li­censed ho­tels, at­trac­tions and with tour op­er­a­tors ap­proved to re­open or re­sume by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB).</p>
    <p>STB chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan said yes­ter­day that this is be­cause these busi­nesses de­pend on tourists for at least 70 per cent to 80 per cent of rev­enue and have been worse hit by the col­lapse of in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers and eater­ies will also ben­e­fit as more ven­ture out on tours or vis­its to at­trac­tions, Mr Tan noted.</p>
    <p>There are no plans to limit the num­ber of vouch­ers that can be used in a sin­gle trans­ac­tion, or to set out how they should be used, he added. The $10 vouch­ers can be spread out across sep­a­rate vis­its, or used up at once on a stay­ca­tion pack­age, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong King Yin, a mar­ket­ing lec­turer at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, said the vouch­ers’ im­pact will de­pend on con­sumers’ will­ing­ness to spend be­yond the $100.</p>
    <p>“Let’s say ev­ery Sin­ga­porean is very fru­gal and en­joys the vouch­ers but doesn’t spend more. Then the stim­u­la­tion (to the in­dus­try) may not be that much,” she said.</p>
    <p>Even if all $320 mil­lion in cred­its are utilised, the amount is only about 1 per cent of the $27.7 bil­lion that tourists spent here last year, she noted.</p>
    <p>But if busi­nesses can come up with cre­ative ways to woo lo­cals, the vouch­ers can act as a cat­a­lyst for more spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Per­sonal pref­er­ences and eco­nomic sen­ti­ment will also be fac­tors in how con­sumers choose to use their cred­its and dig into their wal­lets, Dr Wong said.</p>
    <p>Madam Ong Swee Tee, 74, said she is in­clined to put the vouch­ers towards a stay­ca­tion. How­ever, nav­i­gat­ing on­line book­ing and re­demp­tion plat­forms will be a chal­lenge, said the cof­fee shop as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tive ex­ec­u­tive Lee Kok Leong said the vouch­ers would en­cour­age him to visit more at­trac­tions, as their en­trance fees are “not so af­ford­able”.</p>
    <p>“I can have more ex­pe­ri­ences if I spend on dif­fer­ent at­trac­tions rather than us­ing all for a stay­ca­tion,” said Mr Lee, 42. “Now is also the best time to en­joy these places, before the tourists re­turn.”</p>
