    <p>Rents for re­tail space are ex­pected to fall more sharply in this half of the year amid mount­ing va­can­cies stem­ming from the pan­demic. Cur­rently, many land­lords are still main­tain­ing close to pre-Covid ask­ing rents, but things could change as va­can­cies rise, ac­cord­ing to a re­port.</p>
    <p>Rents for re­tail space are ex­pected to fall more sharply in this half of the year amid mount­ing va­can­cies stem­ming from the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to a re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It noted that while most re­tail busi­nesses re­sumed op­er­a­tions from June 19 af­ter the two-month cir­cuit breaker, so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures mean many ac­tiv­i­ty­based ten­ants, such as those in food and bev­er­age (F&B) and health and well­ness, are un­able to op­er­ate at full ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>This could lead to many busi­nesses shut­ter­ing for good, in turn lead­ing to a rise in va­can­cies in non-prime lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“The en­tire re­tail mar­ket may see steeper falls in rent in (the sec­ond half) due to higher ex­pected va­can­cies, lower foot­falls, so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties due to Covid-19,” said Ms Chris­tine Li, re­search head for Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion at con­sul­tancy Cush­man & Wake­field (C&W), which com­piled the re­port.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently, many land­lords are still main­tain­ing close to pre-Covid ask­ing rents, but as va­can­cies rise, land­lords are ex­pected to be­come more flex­i­ble.”</p>
    <p>The firm said prime re­tail rents slid across the board from the first to the sec­ond quar­ter, led by a 3.5 per cent drop in “other city ar­eas” to $20.88 per sq ft (psf) a month.</p>
    <p>Prime rents fell by 1.5 per cent in Or­chard to $34.73 psf and 0.9 per cent in the sub­urbs ($31.56 psf).</p>
    <p>C&W ex­pects prime rents in Or­chard and other city ar­eas to fall by about 10 per cent this year, while sub­ur­ban prime rents may see a 5 per cent drop.</p>
    <p>Ms Li said rents will be less af­fected in pop­u­lar prime spa­ces in sought-af­ter sub­ur­ban malls that can main­tain high oc­cu­pancy lev­els ow­ing to their strong ten­ant pro­file.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the sec­ond quar­ter, in­door fam­ily at­trac­tion KidZa­nia Sin­ga­pore in Sen­tosa an­nounced its clo­sure af­ter four years while Ger­man-themed Starker Bistro closed all seven of its out­lets here.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket ex­pects more va­cant spa­ces in non-prime lo­ca­tions com­ing on to the mar­ket in this half as ac­tiv­ity-based ten­ants are usu­ally in non-prime spa­ces in malls ow­ing to their larger size re­quire­ments, said C&W.</p>
    <p>There could also be an over­all fall in new de­mand for re­tail spa­ces as F&B ten­ants ex­plore delivery op­tions such as cloud kitchen and cen­tral kitchens, ow­ing to cur­rent so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, it added.</p>
    <p>Other re­tail ca­su­al­ties in­clude 12 Esprit out­lets, while Robin­sons is mov­ing out of Jem next month, and Ise­tan will not re­new its lease at West­gate when it ex­pires in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>C&W said some mall op­er­a­tors can rein­vent space to se­cure re­place­ment ten­ants. Jem re­con­fig­ured its lay­out to ac­com­mo­date Ikea’s first con­cept store, which is tak­ing over the vacancy left by Robin­sons. The store will open next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Lam­pard, C&W’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, re­gional ten­ant rep­re­sen­ta­tion, said: “There is some op­por­tu­nity for re­tail­ers to pur­sue prime re­tail spa­ces dur­ing this time as va­can­cies rise, al­ter­na­tively, they could also ex­plore sub­ur­ban prime op­tions for more sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“What is very clear is that re­tail­ers have the op­por­tu­nity to sharpen their e-com­merce chan­nels in­clud­ing vir­tual live sales,</p>
    <p>given that it is a ma­jor mode of trans­act­ing busi­ness now.”</p>
