    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) re­gards ban­danas, scarves and neck gaiters as “makeshift cov­er­ings that may not have a good fit around the wearer’s nose and mouth”.</p>
    <p>And as they were “made from ma­te­ri­als that are not spe­cific for dis­ease pre­ven­tion, they may not per­form as well as pur­pose-built masks” (Tighter reg­u­la­tions on what con­sti­tutes a mask and how it should be worn come into ef­fect in Sin­ga­pore, ST On­line, Aug 29).</p>
    <p>The ma­te­rial the mask is made from is one of the key fac­tors that de­ter­mine its suit­abil­ity and ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>In that re­spect, a cot­ton neck gaiter may be just as ef­fec­tive as the many cot­ton masks that are be­ing sold – which are com­monly a sin­gle layer of cot­ton with some de­gree of fil­tra­tion, although not as ef­fec­tive as a med­i­cal mask.</p>
    <p>How­ever, fold­ing a cot­ton neck gaiter over to dou­ble the lay­ers may ac­tu­ally in­crease its fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency by up to five times, whereas a cot­ton mask can­not be folded over on the face.</p>
    <p>Form is clearly an­other fac­tor in the ef­fec­tive­ness of a mask. Ban­danas, scarves and hand­ker­chiefs tied around the head would in­deed al­low sig­nif­i­cant air flow out the sides and bot­tom of the cov­er­ing. How­ever, a neck gaiter ac­tu­ally wraps around the en­tire head, cov­er­ing the nose, cheeks, chin and other ar­eas not cov­ered by a mask, and it hugs the face.</p>
    <p>This ac­tu­ally meets MOH’s guide­line that “a mask should be worn such that it closely and com­pletely cov­ers the wearer’s nose and mouth, with­out leav­ing a gap be­tween the mask and the face”.</p>
    <p>If the Govern­ment wants to en­sure trans­mis­sion rates in the com­mu­nity are kept low, with ev­ery mem­ber of the pub­lic wear­ing masks that are de­signed or made specif­i­cally to pre­vent dis­ease trans­mis­sion, they need to ban the use of sin­gle-layer masks and masks that have valves in pub­lic ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Both have low fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency and high breatha­bil­ity, which al­low for the eas­ier spread of the coro­n­avirus. Yet these are still be­ing widely sold and used.</p>
