    <p>Ler Teck Siang, the doc­tor in­volved in the HIV reg­istry data leak that grabbed the head­lines last year, lost his ap­peal yes­ter­day in the High Court against his con­vic­tion for drug-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old Sin­ga­porean was sen­tenced to 15 months’ jail last Oc­to­ber on two charges – one for in­ject­ing a drug abuser with metham­phetamine for a fee and the other for pos­sess­ing a drugstaine­d sy­ringe.</p>
    <p>Ler was ar­rested with the drug abuser, Sim Eng Chee, at the Con­rad Cen­ten­nial Sin­ga­pore ho­tel on March 2, 2018, af­ter the ho­tel’s staff found drugs in Sim’s room and called the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Sim tes­ti­fied dur­ing Ler’s trial that he had hired the doc­tor for “slam­ming” ser­vices ahead of group sex ses­sions with other men.</p>
    <p>Slam­ming is a term used to de­scribe the in­jec­tion of il­licit drugs.</p>
    <p>Ler, who de­nied the charges, claimed that he met Sim to change the man’s wound dress­ing and pro­vided only “mas­sage ser­vices” to Sim. He said “slam­ming” re­ferred to an in­ti­mate mas­sage.</p>
    <p>As for the sy­ringe, Ler claimed that it was from the study room of his Amer­i­can for­mer part­ner,</p>
    <p>Mikhy Far­rera-Brochez.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a nine-day trial, a district judge found Sim’s tes­ti­mony more be­liev­able and con­sis­tent with the mes­sages that had been ex­changed be­tween Ler and Sim.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, in dis­miss­ing Ler’s ap­peal, Judge of Ap­peal Tay Yong Kwang said he came to the same con­clu­sion as the trial judge.</p>
    <p>The sen­tence for the drug of­fences was or­dered to run af­ter Ler fin­ishes serv­ing his two-year jail term for help­ing HIV-pos­i­tive Far­rera-Brochez cheat the au­thor­i­ties into is­su­ing a work pass.</p>
    <p>Ler and Far­rera-Brochez are the duo re­spon­si­ble for leak­ing on the In­ter­net con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion of 14,200 peo­ple di­ag­nosed with HIV.</p>
    <p>Far­rera-Brochez, who worked here as a polytech­nic lec­turer on fake qual­i­fi­ca­tions, was con­victed and jailed by a United States court last Septem­ber for ex­tort­ing the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment with the stolen data.</p>
    <p>Ler faces two more pend­ing charges, one for fail­ing to pro­vide a urine sam­ple and one un­der the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act for fail­ing to take rea­son­able care of data in the HIV reg­istry, which he had ac­cess to when he was head of the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Unit.</p>
