    <p>With the econ­omy con­tin­u­ing to be buf­feted by the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus – as borne out by the weak sec­ond-quar­ter growth – and with min­is­ters’ re­cent hints of more help on the way, some­thing be­yond the sup­port mea­sures in the Govern­ment’s four Budgets was well an­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>That has now come through.</p>
    <p>The $8 bil­lion pack­age an­nounced yes­ter­day by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Finance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat has three key el­e­ments: the ex­ten­sion of wage sub­si­dies to en­able com­pa­nies to sur­vive; more in­cen­tives for them to hire, espe­cially older work­ers; and more help for the un­em­ployed and low-in­come work­ers.</p>
    <p>The Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS), which has been the cen­tre­piece of the Govern­ment’s sup­port pack­age for the cor­po­rate sec­tor, has been ex­tended un­til March next year.</p>
    <p>But its lat­est ver­sion is more tar­geted and fo­cused.</p>
    <p>This makes sense, be­cause the im­pact of Covid-19 has been highly vari­able across sec­tors.</p>
    <p>And af­ter the lift­ing of the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures in June, some busi­nesses were able to re­sume op­er­a­tions, even if at lower lev­els of ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>While many are still strug­gling, some, such as those in the finance and tech­nol­ogy sec­tors, have man­aged to remain largely un­scathed through the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A few, like those in the bio­med­i­cal sec­tor and e-com­merce, have done even bet­ter dur­ing the pan­demic than be­fore it.</p>
    <p>Main­tain­ing gen­er­ous sup­port across the en­tire cor­po­rate sec­tor would have been ex­pen­sive, waste­ful and un­fair. It would also have had the ef­fect of ar­ti­fi­cially propping up un­vi­able com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>And so now, the wage sub­si­dies un­der the JSS range from 10 per cent till the end of the year for com­pa­nies in more buoy­ant sec­tors such as in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, the bio­med­i­cal sciences and fi­nan­cial ser­vices, to 50 per cent till March next year for the hard­est-hit sec­tors such as avi­a­tion and tourism.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers get vary­ing lev­els of sub­si­dies. The built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor, which in­cludes con­struc­tion, gets a 50 per cent sub­sidy for two months, ta­per­ing down to 30 per cent af­ter that till next March, while the arts, en­ter­tain­ment, re­tail, food ser­vices, land trans­port, ma­rine and off­shore sec­tors get a flat 30 per cent sub­sidy for seven more months.</p>
    <p>DI­VER­SITY WITHIN SEC­TORS</p>
    <p>With this more tar­geted ap­proach, sub­si­dies un­der the JSS will more closely match dif­fer­ent lev­els of need by sec­tor.</p>
    <p>That said, there will still be com­pa­nies that do not get enough help, and some that get more than they need.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause even within sec­tors, there is great di­ver­sity and some com­pa­nies may be more re­silient than oth­ers. For ex­am­ple, within the re­tail sec­tor, mom-and-pop shops and mid-level re­tail­ers are likely to have less stay­ing power than big depart­ment</p>
