    <p>Sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing and in­vest­ment flows have held up well in the first half of this year, de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic and gen­eral cli­mate of eco­nomic weak­ness.</p>
    <p>Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) man­ag­ing direc­tor Ravi Menon noted that Sin­ga­pore is Asean’s largest green fi­nance mar­ket, ac­count­ing for close to half of cu­mu­la­tive Asean green bond and loan is­suances.</p>
    <p>At the vir­tual Fi­nan­cial Times In­vest­ing for Good Asia con­fer­ence yesterday, he said Sin­ga­pore is steadily de­vel­op­ing fi­nan­cial so­lu­tions to ad­dress cli­mate risks.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the MAS’ In­sur­ance-linked Se­cu­ri­ties Grant Scheme has seen strong takeup since its launch in 2018. The scheme funds up to 100 per cent of the up­front costs in­curred in is­su­ing catas­tro­phe bonds out of Sin­ga­pore. These are ba­si­cally as­sets that pay in­sur­ers if they suf­fer cat­a­clysmic losses.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon noted that within two years, there have been nine catas­tro­phe bond is­suances in Sin­ga­pore. “This in­cludes the first Asian sov­er­eign and catas­tro­phe bond cov­er­ing earth­quake and typhoon risks in the Philip­pines,” he said.</p>
    <p>More than $8 bil­lion i n green, so­cial and sus­tain­abil­ity bonds have also been is­sued in Sin­ga­pore since the in­tro­duc­tion of the MAS’ Sus­tain­able Bond Grant Scheme in 2017, sup­port­ing the devel­op­ment of re­new­able en­ergy projects, im­prov­ing the en­ergy ef­fi­ciency of buildings, and fi­nanc­ing so­cial en­ter­prises aimed at help­ing lower-in­come women, among other things.</p>
    <p>By the year end, the MAS will launch a sim­i­lar grant to sup­port sus­tain­abil­ity-linked loans, as com­pa­nies in Asia rely more on bank loans than bonds.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said the grant will fund the costs of con­duct­ing ex­ter­nal re­views and rat­ings for green and sus­tain­abil­itylinked loans, and pro­mote the devel­op­ment of sus­tain­able lend­ing frame­works that pro­vide sim­pli­fied pro­cesses and stan­dard­ised cri­te­ria for bor­row­ers. This will re­duce the cost of green bor­row­ing and en­cour­age more small and medium-sized en­ter­prises to tap such loans, he added.</p>
    <p>At a sep­a­rate event on Mon­day, Mr Menon noted that there is greater con­scious­ness about sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has made us all a lot more sen­si­tive and aware of how vul­ner­a­ble we are to the forces of na­ture.”</p>
