    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple are set to get match­ing sums of up to $600 a year to top up their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Re­tire­ment Ac­counts, un­der a new scheme. The move to help more older CPF mem­bers at­tain the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum and pro­vide them re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy will ben­e­fit some 440,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple are set to get match­ing sums of up to $600 a year to top up their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Re­tire­ment Ac­count, un­der a new scheme which kicks off this year.</p>
    <p>The move to help more older CPF mem­bers at­tain the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum and pro­vide them with re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy comes through the Matched Re­tire­ment Sav­ings Scheme, which will ben­e­fit some 440,000 peo­ple. They ac­count for about 53 per cent of CPF mem­bers aged be­tween 55 and 70, said the CPF Board yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The scheme al­lows any­one, in­clud­ing fam­ily mem­bers, em­ploy­ers or mem­bers of the com­mu­nity, to make top-ups to a per­son’s Re­tire­ment Ac­count. Each dol­lar of cash top-up will be matched by the Gov­ern­ment for the next five years, capped at $600 per year.</p>
    <p>Top-ups can be made on the CPF web­site or mo­bile app. They also do not have to be made in a lump sum. This means that those who make small and reg­u­lar top-ups through­out the year us­ing Giro can re­ceive the match­ing grant.</p>
    <p>CPF Board chief ex­ec­u­tive Au­gustin Lee said: “About half of CPF mem­bers turn­ing 55 to­day have yet to at­tain the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum. This match­ing grant by the Gov­ern­ment will en­cour­age them to save more with CPF.</p>
    <p>“There’s no bet­ter sav­ings in­ter­est rate than what CPF pays now. We hope their loved ones and the wider com­mu­nity can also pitch in. Even small amounts saved con­sis­tently can go a long way in se­cur­ing CPF mem­bers’ re­tire­ment needs.”</p>
    <p>Those who are el­i­gi­ble for the scheme must be be­tween 55 and 70 years old, and have less than the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum of $93,000 this year in their Re­tire­ment Ac­count.</p>
    <p>Other cri­te­ria in­clude av­er­age monthly in­come, an­nual value of their res­i­dence, and prop­erty own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble mem­bers will be no­ti­fied by the CPF Board this month. They can also check their el­i­gi­bil­ity on the CPF web­site.</p>
    <p>Ms Selena Ling, OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy, said: “Re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy con­cerns are in­creas­ingly per­ti­nent for an age­ing pop­u­la­tion like Sin­ga­pore’s... While cur­rent in­fla­tion­ary pres­sures are mild due to the pan­demic, nev­er­the­less, in­fla­tion lev­els are ex­pected to re­turn to pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory this year and Sin­ga­pore­ans are also liv­ing longer.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School added: “The match­ing in­cen­tive will help de­velop a habit of aug­ment­ing the re­tire­ment funds early in the CPF con­trib­u­tor’s life.”</p>
    <p>The CPF Board is also part­ner­ing grass­roots lead­ers to en­cour­age the com­mu­nity to build up the re­tire­ment sav­ings of the vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Donors from Bukit Timah pitched in to help 100 res­i­dents, with the first batch of top-ups made yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim Ann, ad­viser to Bukit Timah grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions, said: “Not ev­ery­one might have the cash to do the top-up. This is the rea­son why I feel there is a part for kind strangers to play in this process.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sim, who is also Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, and Na­tional Devel­op­ment, made a top-up to the ac­count of Madam Salmiah, a 62-year-old hawker.</p>
    <p>An­other ben­e­fi­ciary, Mr Lau Eng Kwee, 67, stopped work as a hawker in 2019 due to can­cer. He has to sup­port two adult chil­dren with learn­ing dis­abil­i­ties and his wife. He said: “My fam­ily de­pends on me so these CPF pay­outs are use­ful in help­ing me to go on.”</p>
