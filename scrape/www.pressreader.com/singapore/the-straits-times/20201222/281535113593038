    <p>MediShield Life pol­i­cy­hold­ers who do not have suf­fi­cient MediSave bal­ances will have their pre­mium pay­ment de­ferred un­til the end of De­cem­ber next year, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This comes as pre­mi­ums are set to rise by up to 35 per cent next year un­der the first ma­jor re­view of the na­tional health in­surance pro­gramme since its launch in 2015.</p>
    <p>MOH said the Gov­ern­ment has ac­cepted all the rec­om­men­da­tions of the MediShield Life Coun­cil, which be­gan re­view­ing the scheme in 2018.</p>
    <p>The changes will take ef­fect in March next year, and raise the an­nual pol­icy claim limit by $50,000 to $150,000, among other ex­panded ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Treat­ments for at­tempted sui­cide, drug ad­dic­tion and al­co­holism will also be in­cluded un­der the manda­tory ba­sic health in­surance plan.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has pre­vi­ously said it will pro­vide pre­mium sub­si­dies and sup­port of up to $2.2 bil­lion over the next three years.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes $1.8 bil­lion for ex­ist­ing pre­mium sub­si­dies and sup­port mea­sures for lower- and mid­dle-in­come house­holds, Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion and Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion se­niors, and the fi­nan­cially needy.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said an­nual MediSave top-ups for Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion se­niors, which can be used to pay MediShield Life pre­mi­ums, will be en­hanced.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cially needy can also ap­ply for ad­di­tional pre­mium sup­port, added MOH.</p>
    <p>The sup­port will also in­clude a one-off Covid-19 sub­sidy for all Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens for two years to cush­ion the im­pact of pre­mium ad­just­ments dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This $360 mil­lion sub­sidy will cover 70 per cent of the net in­crease in pre­mi­ums af­ter tak­ing into ac­count ex­ist­ing sub­si­dies in the first year, fol­lowed by 30 per cent in the sec­ond year.</p>
    <p>Said the min­istry: “Th­ese mea­sures will keep the net pre­mium in­creases for all Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens to no more than about 10 per cent in the first year.”</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the changes, Min­is­ter for Health Gan Kim Yong said yes­ter­day: “MediShield Life was cre­ated to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans would be pro­tected against large hos­pi­tal bills for life.</p>
    <p>“To en­sure that the scheme can con­tinue to be rel­e­vant and sus­tain­able, the Gov­ern­ment has ac­cepted the MediShield Life Coun­cil’s rec­om­men­da­tions to en­hance the scheme and ad­just the pre­mi­ums.”</p>
    <p>Mr Hitesh Shah, a mem­ber of the MediShield Life 2020 Re­view work­ing group at the Sin­ga­pore Ac­tu­ar­ial So­ci­ety, said the changes will help the pro­gramme keep to its goal of cov­er­ing nine in 10 sub­sidised bills as in­fla­tion has made the old claim lim­its out­dated.</p>
    <p>But he said it would give the pub­lic more peace of mind if more in­for­ma­tion on what is driv­ing in­creases in costs and the need for higher pre­mi­ums is made avail­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Shah noted that un­like most pri­vate in­surance schemes, a sub­stan­tial por­tion of MediShield Life pre­mi­ums col­lected go into a re­serve fund for fu­ture claims pay­outs and pre­mium re­bates, which are dis­bursed when a pol­i­cy­holder reaches a cer­tain age.</p>
    <p>This is in­cluded when cal­cu­lat­ing the loss ra­tio, or the losses it in­curs as a per­cent­age of pre­mi­ums col­lected. How­ever, a de­tailed break­down of the change in re­quired re­serves is not avail­able.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age loss ra­tio of the MediShield Life fund from 2016 to last year was 104 per cent.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Shah: “What I’d like to see some­where is, what is the loss ra­tio we are aim­ing for? It will help greatly if this was made more pub­lic and there was a de­bate about what the right level is.”</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING IT SUS­TAIN­ABLE</p>
    <p>MediShield Life was cre­ated to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans would be pro­tected against large hos­pi­tal bills for life. To en­sure that the scheme can con­tinue to be rel­e­vant and sus­tain­able, the Gov­ern­ment has ac­cepted the MediShield Life Coun­cil’s rec­om­men­da­tions to en­hance the scheme and ’’ ad­just the pre­mi­ums.
