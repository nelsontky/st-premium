    <p>MADRID • Real Madrid goal­keeper Thibaut Cour­tois j oined coach Zine­dine Zi­dane in crit­i­cis­ing La Liga for not post­pon­ing their Span­ish league game at 19th-placed Osasuna on Satur­day due to a snow­storm.</p>
    <p>The match fin­ished 0-0, dent­ing the cham­pi­ons’ ti­tle bid, after they were or­dered by La Liga to travel to Pam­plona the day be­fore the game due to storm warn­ings.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the team were forced to wait for four hours on the icy run­way be­fore tak­ing off, leav­ing Real fu­ri­ous at the way they were treated.</p>
    <p>The snow buf­feted the pitch and Zi­dane’s men failed to get a grip on the game, fail­ing to have a shot on tar­get in the first half.</p>
    <p>Im­ply­ing La Liga had cost his side two points, the French­man said: “That was not a foot­ball match, it should have been called off.</p>
    <p>“We dealt badly with the con­di­tions and the jour­ney, and we did what we could on the pitch but the sen­sa­tion we have now is that it wasn’t a proper match.</p>
    <p>“My big­gest com­plaint is about the match. The con­di­tions weren’t right. I know I’m re­peat­ing my­self, but that’s how it is.”</p>
    <p>Cour­tois agreed, telling Span­ish net­work Mo­vis­tar: “I have to thank the staff at Osasuna for what they did with the pitch but (mak­ing us play) was lam­en­ta­ble.</p>
    <p>“They (La Liga) knew for a long time that this was go­ing to hap­pen but they made us take off on a frozen run­way.”</p>
    <p>The bad weather did not let up, pre­vent­ing Real from re­turn­ing to Madrid after the game as usual and the team had to spend the night in Pam­plona.</p>
    <p>They play Ath­letic Bil­bao in the Span­ish Su­per Cup in Malaga on Thurs­day and Cour­tois felt that La</p>
    <p>Liga failed to show em­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>“We ar­rived at the sta­dium with the roads full of snow. We have to pri­ori­tise peo­ple’s safety,” the Bel­gium No. 1 said. “We do what we are asked.</p>
    <p>“We knew that if we didn’t come here, we could lose the points but all you need to do is take a look and the roads. We also have fam­i­lies and we’re not pup­pets who have to play all the time.”</p>
    <p>La Liga did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment but the snow­storm, which paral­ysed parts of Spain, meant lead­ers</p>
    <p>Atletico Madrid’s home match with Bil­bao was called off, while Elche’s home game against Getafe was moved 24 hours to to­day.</p>
    <p>The weather was bet­ter in the south of Spain and Lionel Messi and An­toine Griez­mann had a dou­ble each as Barcelona thrashed Granada 4-0 away to win a third con­sec­u­tive La Liga game for the first time this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The third-placed Cata­lans re­main four points be­hind Atletico (38), who also have three games in hand. Real are on 37 and like Barca have played 18 games.</p>
