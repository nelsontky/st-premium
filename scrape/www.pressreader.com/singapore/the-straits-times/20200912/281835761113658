    <p>ISKANDAR PUTERI • Malaysia’s Health Min­istry is look­ing at the pos­si­bil­ity of fully re­open­ing the Malaysia-Sin­ga­pore bor­der for daily com­muters in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Ad­ham Baba said yes­ter­day that the re­cov­ery move­ment con­trol or­der pe­riod over the next four months would be an im­por­tant time for the coun­try as it would de­ter­mine if it is pos­si­ble to re­open the bor­der with Sin­ga­pore fully.</p>
    <p>He said that dur­ing this time, a more sys­tem­atic ap­proach would be taken in ar­eas such as bor­der con­trol, phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing and the use of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ad­ham said in con­sid­er­ing whether to fully re­open the bor­der, the min­istry has to con­sider peo­ple’s liveli­hood, which has been af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We must find a bal­ance as both the econ­omy and health of peo­ple are very im­por­tant mat­ters,” he said af­ter at­tend­ing an event that paid trib­ute to front lin­ers in the form of a mu­ral con­structed from Lego bricks at the Le­goland Malaysia Re­sort.</p>
    <p>The mu­ral was un­veiled by Jo­hor Men­teri Be­sar Hasni Mo­ham­mad, Dr Ad­ham and Tourism, Arts, and Cul­ture Min­is­ter Nancy Shukri.</p>
    <p>Dr Ad­ham also said the min­istry is look­ing at dou­bling its ca­pac­ity in swab­bing trav­ellers for Covid-19 un­der the cur­rent Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane (RGL) and Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment (PCA) schemes.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Datuk Hasni said the state gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to push Putrajaya to open up the bor­der with Sin­ga­pore as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Jo­hor wants the bor­der to be fully open for daily com­muters and not just with the RGL and PCA.</p>
    <p>“Prior to the RGL and PCA, there was al­ready move­ment be­tween the two coun­tries, with Malaysia send­ing cargo con­tain­ing med­i­cal and food sup­plies,” he added.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Mr Hasni said at the Jo­hor as­sem­bly that the state was able to con­duct more than 2,000 Covid-19 tests daily for those go­ing to and from Sin­ga­pore un­der the RGL and PCA.</p>
    <p>He said that as of Aug 31, 320 in­di­vid­u­als had trav­elled to and from Sin­ga­pore un­der the RGL, with another 8,270 un­der the PCA.</p>
