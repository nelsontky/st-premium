    <p>SAN CRIS­TO­BAL VER­A­PAZ (Gu­atemala) • Res­cue work­ers clam­bered over treach­er­ous roads buried in mud and rub­ble to reach a re­mote vil­lage i n Gu­atemala swamped by a dev­as­tat­ing storm over the week­end that has killed and led to the dis­ap­pear­ance of dozens of peo­ple across Cen­tral Amer­ica and south­ern Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>Storm Eta’s tor­ren­tial down­pours top­pled trees, en­gorged swift-mov­ing rivers and ripped down parts of a moun­tain­side above the vil­lage of Queja in the cen­tral Gu­atemalan re­gion of Alta Ver­a­paz, bury­ing dozens of peo­ple in their homes.</p>
    <p>The heavy rain is still trig­ger­ing mud­slides in Queja, halt­ing res­cue ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Car­ry­ing a small child in her arms, Ms Glo­ria Cac, a mem­ber of the Po­qom­chi’ peo­ple and a res­i­dent of Queja, said 22 fam­ily mem­bers were miss­ing after the moun­tain col­lapsed onto the vil­lage.</p>
    <p>Mr Fran­cisco Muz, a re­tired gen­eral who was help­ing in the res­cue ef­forts, said the land­slides have not stopped be­cause of the con­tin­u­ous rain in the moun­tains.</p>
    <p>“At ground zero, there is a ter­ri­ble re­al­ity... this na­tional tragedy is cen­tred in San Cris­to­bal Ver­a­paz, in Queja vil­lage,” Mr Muz said.</p>
    <p>The dev­as­tat­ing weather front</p>
    <p>spread de­struc­tion from Panama to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Hon­duras and Mex­ico, and has con­tin­ued to push the death toll higher in those coun­tries. It now stands at more than 65.</p>
    <p>Panama’s govern­ment in­creased its tally after floods and land­slides killed 17 peo­ple there. Two min­ers were re­ported killed in Nicaragua, while in south­ern Costa Rica, a land­slide killed a Costa Ri­can woman and an Amer­i­can man in a house. A man was killed in El Sal­vador, and Hon­duras has re­ported 25 dead and two miss­ing.</p>
    <p>In the Mex­i­can state of Chi­a­pas, flood­ing has killed 19 peo­ple, many swept up by rivers whose banks burst, said the state au­thor­i­ties. North of Chi­a­pas in Tabasco state, the del­uges killed two more peo</p>
    <p>ple, the fed­eral govern­ment said.</p>
    <p>The dev­as­ta­tion harked back to Hur­ri­cane Mitch, which killed some 10,000 peo­ple in Cen­tral Amer­ica in 1998.</p>
    <p>Eta, one of the fiercest storms to hit Cen­tral Amer­ica in years, struck Nicaragua as a Cat­e­gory 4 hur­ri­cane last Tues­day with winds of 240kmh.</p>
    <p>Now down­graded to a tropical storm, it has since moved north over the Caribbean Sea and yes­ter­day made land­fall along the south­cen­tral coast of Cuba and was fore­cast to pro­duce dan­ger­ous storm surge, flash floods and strong winds over por­tions of Cuba and Florida, the United States Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of thou­sands of Cubans be­gan evac­u­at­ing their</p>
    <p>homes last Satur­day as Eta closed in.</p>
    <p>Fresh land­slides late on Satur­day halted Gu­atemalan res­cue work­ers’ ef­forts to dig through mud of up to 15m deep in Queja. The head of a lo­cal emer­gency worker team said res­cue ef­forts had been called off, pos­si­bly per­ma­nently.</p>
    <p>Emer­gency worker Juan Al­berto Leal said: “We are co­or­di­nat­ing so that all the per­son­nel are evac­u­ated in the morn­ing be­cause we can’t work there. If we stay, lives will be lost.”</p>
    <p>Mr Leal said re­lent­less rain was mak­ing the soil too loose to work in safely, and new land­slides were forc­ing work­ers to flee to safer ground in the vil­lage.</p>
    <p>Some 55 sol­diers, 25 fire­fight­ers and 15 po­lice of­fi­cers had ear­lier</p>
    <p>man­aged to reach the site of the dis­as­ter and were us­ing shov­els and picks to search for sur­vivors and re­trieve bod­ies.</p>
    <p>So far, three bod­ies have been re­cov­ered. Army spokesman Colonel Ruben Tellez said it could take months to un­earth all the homes.</p>
    <p>Gu­atemalan dis­as­ter re­lief agency Conred said 103 peo­ple were still miss­ing and 21 con­firmed dead in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan do­nated US$200,000 (S$269,000) and the US gave US$120,000 for the pur­chase of food and drink­ing wa­ter, Gu­atemalan Pres­i­dent Ale­jan­dro Gi­ammat­tei said.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of peo­ple in the shel­ters has con­tin­ued to grow and we haven’t fin­ished res­cu­ing peo­ple,” he added.</p>
    <p>MR FRAN­CISCO MUZ, a re­tired gen­eral who is help­ing in the res­cue ef­forts in the vil­lage of Queja in the cen­tral Gu­atemalan re­gion of Alta Ver­a­paz. He said the land­slides have not stopped be­cause of the con­tin­u­ous rain in the moun­tains.</p>
