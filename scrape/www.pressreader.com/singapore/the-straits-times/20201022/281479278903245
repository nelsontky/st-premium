    <p>With a nom­i­na­tion for a Golden Horse act­ing award un­der his belt, home-grown co­me­dian Mark Lee’s ef­forts to show his chops as a se­ri­ous char­ac­ter ac­tor are fi­nally pay­ing off</p>
    <p>When lo­cal ac­tor Mark Lee first heard that his per­for­mance in the film Num­ber 1 had been nom­i­nated for a Golden Horse Award, his re­ac­tion was: “Oh, okay.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Man­darin in a tele­phone in­ter­view with The Straits Times, the 52-year-old says: “It only slowly dawned on me as peo­ple started send­ing me their con­grat­u­la­tions that, ‘Wah, I got nom­i­nated for Best Lead­ing Ac­tor’.”</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of three says his wife was ini­tially more ex­cited about the nod than him, jump­ing for joy and hug­ging and kiss­ing him when she heard the news.</p>
    <p>He is mar­ried to Ms Cather­ine Ng, 47, who helps man­age his chicken rice ven­ture.</p>
    <p>His chil­dren, espe­cially his el­dest child Cal­ista, 12, were happy for him too, though his younger kids – Mark­sonn, nine, and Ca­lynn, seven – are less clued into the sig­nif­i­cance of the awards, the most pres­ti­gious in Chi­nese-lan­guage cin­ema.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean ac­tor Gur­mit Singh was pre­vi­ously nom­i­nated in this cat­e­gory for com­edy Just Fol­low Law in 2007, but lost to Lust, Cau­tion’s Tony Le­ung Chiu Wai.</p>
    <p>In Num­ber 1, which opens to­day in cin­e­mas, Lee plays a re­trenched white-col­lar man­ager who un­wit­tingly gets a job as a drag queen and dis­cov­ers his tal­ent and love of stage per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>He had his eye on the role early on, ever since he saw scriptwrit­er and ac­tor Jaspers Lai pen­ning the script dur­ing film­ing breaks on the set of Won­der­ful! Liang Xi Mei (2018). Lai, 33, and Lee were costars on that project.</p>
    <p>On learn­ing the plot of the movie, Lee re­calls: “I im­me­di­ately said I wanted the lead role. I even called the film pro­duc­tion com­pany mm2</p>
    <p>En­ter­tain­ment to say I wanted the role. They agreed, but I had to keep ask­ing be­cause there was no re­ply on when the film­ing would be­gin.”</p>
    <p>He felt there was much dra­matic po­ten­tial in the de­vel­op­ment of the char­ac­ter – who goes from some­one un­able to ac­cept drag per­for­mances to fully em­brac­ing them.</p>
    <p>The in­ten­sity of the drag per­for­mances, make-up and cos­tume fit­tings were a new chal­lenge for Lee, even though he is no stranger to cross-dress­ing as one of the stars on the long-run­ning 1990s va­ri­ety se­ries Com­edy Nite.</p>
    <p>He says: “Sure, we cross-dressed on Com­edy Nite in sketches, but those were j ust nor­mal fe­male clothes. Pro­fes­sional drag queens are com­pletely dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“Aside from the singing and danc­ing, there are the vi­su­als: the sparkly make-up, the feather boas, the wigs. And they must wear high heels that are five to six inches high. The walk­ing, the ges­tures, the lan­guage – it’s a to­tal pack­age.”</p>
    <p>He says the cast trained for around three times a week for six weeks with a pro­fes­sional drag per­former be­fore film­ing be­gan.</p>
    <p>He spent the first three days sim­ply learn­ing how to sashay in high heels. He was even told to don fe­male un­der­wear for his drag per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>“At first, I was like, ‘Why? Who can see?’ I was very frus­trated. But it’s a psy­cho­log­i­cal thing. When you wear fe­male un­der­wear and see your­self in the mir­ror, you be­lieve and you start to feel like you’re a woman.”</p>
    <p>The most mem­o­rable scene in the movie for Lee was when he and his drag queen friends sprinted through Sin­ga­pore in drag. “We ran from 8pm to 6.30am the next morn­ing. It was the last day of film­ing, but the most in­tense,” he says.</p>
    <p>His fel­low drag queen per­form­ers in the cast in­clude Lai as well as Tai­wanese trans­gen­der ac­tress Ki­we­baby Chang. Veteran stars like Henry Thia also make ap­pear­ances in the movie.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean direc­tor Ong Kuo Sin (Judge­ment Day, 2013) says: “We have an Aus­tralian cin­e­matog­ra­pher, a Tai­wanese ac­tress.</p>
    <p>There are these dif­fer­ent cul­tures in the film. I felt very sup­ported by the strong cast and crew.”</p>
    <p>The film has made Lee more aware of the so­cial stigma drag per­form­ers face. He says: “If some­one is mak­ing ends meet through le­gal and valid ways, then we shouldn’t dis­crim­i­nate against them. Their job is tougher than other celebritie­s – they have to en­dure all these in­sults be­cause of the na­ture of the job.”</p>
    <p>His wife and daugh­ter Ca­lynn caught sight of him in drag when they vis­ited him on set in Pe­nang.</p>
    <p>The veteran fun­ny­man jokes: “I think when my wife saw me, she felt much more as­sured about her beauty.”</p>
    <p>His youngest child was “scared” of his drag per­sona at first and had to warm up slowly.</p>
    <p>And Lee might not be done with drag yet as first-time scriptwrit­er Lai has plans to pen a se­quel.</p>
    <p>The hard work for Num­ber 1 has paid off for Lee, who has fi­nally been recog­nised for his act­ing chops in a se­ri­ous role.</p>
    <p>He says: “It’s not been an easy road. As a comedic ac­tor, ev­ery­body wants laugh­ter from you, but I feel an ac­tor should ex­tend and de­velop in all di­rec­tions. But a lot of op­por­tu­ni­ties come down to fate and com­edy is my ori­gin. I will never aban­don comedic act­ing even if I am recog­nised as a dra­matic ac­tor.”</p>
    <p>He says he “very much wants to win” and will fly to Taipei to at­tend the awards cer­e­mony on Nov 21. He has cleared his sched­ule to com­ply with stay-home no­tices and quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Will he walk the red car­pet in drag? He says: “No, this is my first time at such a ma­jor awards show. I want to suit up and look my most hand­some ever.”</p>
    <p>Num­ber 1 opens in Sin­ga­pore to­day.</p>
    <p>The 57th Golden Horse Awards Pre­sen­ta­tion Cer­e­mony will air on Hub E City (StarHub TV Chan­nel 825) on Nov 21 at 7pm.</p>
