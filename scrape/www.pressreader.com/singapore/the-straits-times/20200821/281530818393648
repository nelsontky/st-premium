    <p>Thou­sands of jobs in start-up firms are on of­fer as they di­ver­sify and get help to spread their wings. “These op­por­tu­ni­ties of­fered by start-ups are wide-rang­ing and di­verse,” said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo yes­ter­day, dur­ing a visit to the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of jobs in start-up firms are on of­fer as they di­ver­sify their fields and get help to spread their wings.</p>
    <p>“These op­por­tu­ni­ties of­fered by start-ups are wide-rang­ing and di­verse,” said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo yes­ter­day, dur­ing a visit to The Green­house at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of Innovation and En­trepreneur­ship.</p>
    <p>She high­lighted that the start-up scene in Sin­ga­pore is brim­ming with po­ten­tial and is a source of job growth that can po­ten­tially ex­pand, with sup­port from the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive, a scheme which pro­vides sup­port to em­ploy­ers who can grow their lo­cal head­count over the next six months.</p>
    <p>Over 4,600 jobs and 860 trainee­ships are on of­fer from more than 1,600 start-ups, as part of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said in its weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port yes­ter­day. This pack­age aims to sup­port close to 100,000 job seek­ers this year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s up­date on the startup sec­tor and its job op­por­tu­ni­ties was the first in a se­ries of reg­u­lar up­dates that the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try and MOM are pro­vid­ing on var­i­ous sec­tors of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The start-up sec­tor is part of a seg­ment of com­pa­nies with good po­ten­tial and grow­ing mar­kets, which the Gov­ern­ment will sup­port to cre­ate bet­ter jobs.</p>
    <p>As part of this drive, the Startup SG Founder pro­gramme, which helps first-time en­trepreneur­s get their busi­ness ideas up and run­ning, has been en­hanced.</p>
    <p>Be­sides a larger start-up cap­i­tal grant of $50,000, a ven­ture build­ing pro­gramme which pro­vides par­tic­i­pants with a monthly stipend while they tackle in­dus­try prob­lems has also been added to the Startup SG Founder pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Apart from in­no­vat­ing and solv­ing real-world prob­lems, start-ups are also help­ing to cre­ate jobs, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>Up to $150 mil­lion has been set aside for en­hance­ments to the Startup SG Founder pro­gramme, in phases.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said: “We are de­ter­mined to grow a new gen­er­a­tion of com­pa­nies from Sin­ga­pore to serve not just the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket, but also the re­gional and global mar­kets. Now, in ev­ery cri­sis, there are al­ways op­por­tu­ni­ties for us to grow a new gen­er­a­tion of com­pa­nies. And this cri­sis is no dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>While these ef­forts started be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Gov­ern­ment has ac­cel­er­ated many of the ini­tia­tives to help start-ups grow and pen­e­trate new mar­kets dur­ing this cri­sis, he added.</p>
    <p>These firms have al­ready widened their range to en­ter new fields, he said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said the start-ups are of­fer­ing both tech-re­lated roles and less con­ven­tional ones like an­i­ma­tors.</p>
    <p>“These are not the usual roles that we would think of, and job seek­ers may have to put in a bit more ef­fort to un­der­stand what these roles en­tail, per­haps get in touch with the em­ploy­ers to see if there is a good match in skills, or if the gaps can be bridged with a lit­tle ef­fort,” she added.</p>
    <p>MOM also noted in its re­port that about 6,300 em­ploy­ers sub­mit­ted no­ti­fi­ca­tions on cost-sav­ing mea­sures to the min­istry be­tween March and July.</p>
    <p>Around 224,800 lo­cal and for­eign em­ploy­ees were af­fected, with about half of these in the ac­com­mo­da­tion and food ser­vices, con­struc­tion, as well as whole­sale and re­tail trade sec­tors.</p>
    <p>More cash is on hand to help first­time en­trepreneur­s get their busi­ness ideas off the ground and gen­er­ate jobs amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They can ap­ply for cap­i­tal grants of $50,000, up from $30,000 now as part of en­hance­ments to the Startup SG Founder pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The changes also in­clude a three­month ven­ture build­ing scheme to help new firms get their in­no­va­tive ideas up and run­ning.</p>
    <p>The en­hance­ments were de­tailed by Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing and Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo dur­ing a visit to The Green­house, Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of Innovation and En­trepreneur­ship.</p>
    <p>They fol­low Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat’s an­nounce­ment on Mon­day that $150 mil­lion has been set aside to bol­ster the Startup SG Founder pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which is over­seen by gov­ern­ment agency En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG), be­gan in 2017 to pro­vide men­tor­ship and start-up cap­i­tal grants to first-time en­trepreneur­s with in­no­va­tive ideas.</p>
    <p>Its lat­est en­hance­ments will see the pre-seed grant sup­port for each start-up over a 12-month pe­riod in­creased by $20,000 to $50,000, but the co-match­ing funds re­quired by the start-up stay at $10,000.</p>
    <p>There are also moves to strengthen their Sin­ga­porean core. Start-ups ap­ply­ing for a grant must now be formed with a min­i­mum of three Sin­ga­pore­ans and/or per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs), in­clu­sive of founders. And at least two of those founders must be first-timers.</p>
    <p>This is up from the pre­vi­ous re­quire­ment of hav­ing at least one Sin­ga­porean or PR.</p>
    <p>The new ven­ture build­ing pro­gramme will help par­tic­i­pants in ar­eas such as prod­uct de­vel­op­ment, com­mer­cial is at ion and fund­ing. The pro­gramme is open to Sin­ga­pore­ans and PRs, with each par­tic­i­pant re­ceiv­ing a monthly stipend of $1,500 dur­ing its three-month du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Five au­ton­o­mous uni­ver­si­ties, in­clud­ing the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, will pro­vide the ven­ture build­ing pro­gramme, with ap­pli­ca­tions open by the month’s end.</p>
    <p>ESG will pro­gres­sively ex­pand the list of part­ners for the ven­ture build­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Mr James Tan, chair­man of the Ac­tion Com­mu­nity for En­trepreneur­ship, a pri­vate sec­tor-led or­gan­i­sa­tion, noted that more fresh grad­u­ates want to form start-ups so the ven­ture build­ing pro­gramme will pro­vide a struc­ture where they can ad­dress spe­cific prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“This... po­ten­tially mas­sive group of peo­ple are go­ing to be fun­nelled through the ven­ture build­ing pro­gramme and (they can) fo­cus (their) en­er­gies on so­lu­tions that are ac­tu­ally a prob­lem to solve, and not cre­ate some­thing that the world is not look­ing for,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Startup SG Founder pro­gramme has around 50 ac­cred­ited men­tor part­ners in var­i­ous deeptech in­dus­tries, in­clud­ing agri-tech and ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Last year, 74 start-ups re­ceived struc­tured men­tor­ing from 43 men­tor part­ners un­der the pro­gramme and were awarded grants amount­ing to $2.22 mil­lion for busi­ness de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Our start-up ecosys­tem has con­trib­uted to Sin­ga­pore’s on­go­ing trans­for­ma­tion to an in­no­va­tion­driven econ­omy,” said ESG as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive for innovation and en­ter­prise Ed­win Chow.</p>
    <p>“Start-ups have an in­nate abil­ity to adapt and pivot, to quickly spot op­por­tu­ni­ties and pro­vide ef­fec­tive so­lu­tions. This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant dur­ing crises.”</p>
