    <p>It was a July morn­ing that be­gan as or­di­nar­ily as any other day: Make break­fast. Feed the dogs. Take vi­ta­mins. Find that miss­ing sock. Pick up the rogue crayon that rolled un­der the ta­ble. Throw my hair in a pony­tail be­fore get­ting my son from his crib.</p>
    <p>After chang­ing his di­a­per, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, hum­ming a lul­laby to keep us both calm, the cheer­ful tune a stark con­trast to my sense that some­thing was not right.</p>
    <p>I knew, as I clutched my first­born child, that I was los­ing my sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Hours later, I lay in a hos­pi­tal bed, hold­ing my hus­band’s hand. I felt the clam­mi­ness of his palm and kissed his knuck­les, wet from both our tears. Star­ing at the cold white walls, my eyes glazed over. I tried to imag­ine how we’d heal.</p>
    <p>I re­called a mo­ment last year when Harry and I were fin­ish­ing up a long tour in South Africa. I was ex­hausted. I was breast­feed­ing our in­fant son, and I was try­ing to keep a brave face in the very public eye.</p>
    <p>“Are you OK?” a jour­nal­ist asked me. I an­swered him hon­estly, not know­ing that what I said would res­onate with so many – new mums and older ones, and any­one who had, in their own way, been silently suf­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>My off-the-cuff re­ply seemed to give peo­ple per­mis­sion to speak their truth. But it wasn’t re­spond­ing hon­estly that helped me most, it was the ques­tion it­self.</p>
    <p>“Thank you for ask­ing,” I said.</p>
    <p>“Not many peo­ple have asked if I’m OK.”</p>
    <p>Sit­ting in a hos­pi­tal bed, watch­ing my hus­band’s heart break as he tried to hold the shat­tered pieces of mine, I re­alised that the only way to be­gin to heal is to first ask, “Are you OK?”</p>
    <p>Are we? This year has brought so many of us to our break­ing points.</p>
    <p>Loss and pain plagued every one of us in 2020, in mo­ments both fraught and de­bil­i­tat­ing.</p>
    <p>We’ve heard all the sto­ries: A woman starts her day, as nor­mal as any other, but then re­ceives a call that she’s lost her el­derly mother to Covid-19. A man wakes feel­ing fine, maybe a lit­tle slug­gish, but noth­ing out of the or­di­nary. He tests pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus and, within weeks, he – like hun­dreds of thou­sands of oth­ers – has died.</p>
    <p>A young woman named Bre­onna Tay­lor goes to sleep, just as she’s done every night be­fore, but she doesn’t live to see the morn­ing be­cause a po­lice raid goes hor­ri­bly wrong. Mr Ge­orge Floyd leaves a con­ve­nience store, not re­al­is­ing he will take his last breath un­der the weight of some­one’s knee and, in his fi­nal mo­ments, calls out for his mum. Peace­ful protests be­come vi­o­lent. Health rapidly shifts to sick­ness. In places where there was once com­mu­nity, there is now di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>On top of all of this, it seems we no longer agree on what is true. We aren’t fight­ing over just our opin­ions of facts; we are po­larised over whether the fact is, in fact, a fact. We are at odds over whether sci­ence is real. We are at odds over whether an elec­tion has been won or lost. We are at odds over the value of com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>That po­lar­i­sa­tion, cou­pled with the so­cial iso­la­tion re­quired to fight this pan­demic, has left us feel­ing more alone than ever.</p>
    <p>When I was in my late teens, I sat in the back of a taxi zip­ping through the busy­ness and bus­tle of Man­hat­tan. I looked out the win­dow and saw a woman on her phone in a flood of tears. She was stand­ing on the side­walk, liv­ing out a pri­vate mo­ment very pub­licly. At the time, the city was new to me, and I asked the driver if we should stop to see if the woman needed help.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that New York­ers live out their per­sonal lives in public spa­ces. “We love in the city, we cry in the street, our emo­tions and sto­ries there for any­body to see,” I re­mem­ber him telling me. “Don’t worry, some­body on that cor­ner will ask her if she’s OK.”</p>
    <p>Now, all th­ese years later, in iso­la­tion and lock­down, griev­ing the loss of a child, the loss of my coun­try’s shared be­lief in what’s true, I think of that woman in New York. What if no one stopped? What if no one saw her suf­fer­ing? What if no one helped?</p>
    <p>I wish I could go back and ask my cab driver to pull over. This, I re­alise, is the dan­ger of siloed liv­ing – where mo­ments sad, scary or sacro­sanct are all lived out alone. There is no one stop­ping to ask, “Are you OK?”</p>
    <p>Los­ing a child means car­ry­ing an al­most un­bear­able grief, ex­pe­ri­enced by many but talked about by few.</p>
    <p>In the pain of our loss, my hus­band and I dis­cov­ered that in a room of 100 women, 10 to 20 of them will have suf­fered from mis­car­riage. Yet, de­spite the stag­ger­ing com­mon­al­ity of this pain, the con­ver­sa­tion re­mains taboo, rid­dled with (un­war­ranted) shame, and per­pet­u­at­ing a cy­cle of soli­tary mourn­ing.</p>
    <p>Some have bravely shared their sto­ries; they have opened the door, know­ing that when one per­son speaks truth, it gives li­cence for all of us to do the same.</p>
    <p>We have learnt that when peo­ple ask how any of us are do­ing, and when they re­ally lis­ten to the an­swer, with an open heart and mind, the load of grief of­ten be­comes lighter – for all of us. In be­ing in­vited to share our pain, to­gether we take the first steps to­wards heal­ing.</p>
    <p>So this Thanks­giv­ing, as we plan for a hol­i­day un­like any be­fore – many of us separated from our loved ones, alone, sick, scared, di­vided and per­haps strug­gling to find some­thing, any­thing, to be grate­ful for – let us com­mit to ask­ing oth­ers, “Are you OK?”</p>
    <p>As much as we may dis­agree, as phys­i­cally dis­tanced as we may be, the truth is that we are more con­nected than ever be­cause of all we have in­di­vid­u­ally and col­lec­tively en­dured this year.</p>
    <p>We are ad­just­ing to a new nor­mal where faces are con­cealed by masks, but it’s forc­ing us to look into one an­other’s eyes – some­times filled with warmth, other times with tears. For the first time, in a long time, as hu­man be­ings, we are re­ally see­ing one an­other.</p>
    <p>Are we OK? We will be.</p>
