    <p>• With its black sports jacket, re­flec­tive avi­a­tor sun­glasses and be­spoke orange hel­met with holes for its ears, Bo­gie the dog sure is one suave-look­ing canine, with an Easy Rider look that would earn it a place in any mo­tor­cy­cle gang.</p>
    <p>The 11-year-old cross­breed from the Philip­pines takes daily mo­tor­cy­cle rides with its owner Gil­bert De­los Reyes, bal­anc­ing per­fectly with its hind legs on the edge of the seat and front paws strad­dling the han­dle­bars.</p>
    <p>Bo­gie has be­come a neigh­bour­hood celebrity and is a mag­net for at­ten­tion on moun­tain and beach road trips.</p>
    <p>“The first thing I taught him when he was around four months old was how to ride a mo­tor­cy­cle. I would carry him when­ever I rode,” said Mr Reyes, who owns a mo­tor­cy­cle shop in Cavite prov­ince out­side the cap­i­tal Manila.</p>
    <p>“One day, he just started fol­low­ing me ev­ery time I left the house. As soon as I started the en­gine, he would get ex­cited and jump on the bike.”</p>
    <p>Bo­gie is also good for business,</p>
    <p>help­ing to draw cus­tomers ea­ger to take pic­tures with him to Mr Reyes’ shop, and dol­ing out paw­shakes as well.</p>
    <p>It has even proven it­self use­ful as a guard dog, once chas­ing after thieves who tried to steal its owner’s gold neck­lace at an in­ter­sec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Reyes bought Bo­gie when it was a month old for just 100 pe­sos (S$2.80), but says the dog has been a lucky charm, and is price­less.</p>
    <p>“I think of Bo­gie as a son. He’s been with me for 11 years and is a big part of my life,” said Mr Reyes.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had so many ad­ven­tures and been to many places to­gether, I don’t think I can ever re­place him.”</p>
