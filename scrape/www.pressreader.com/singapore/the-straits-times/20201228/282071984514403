    <p>Ear­lier this year, deputy pub­lic pros­e­cu­tors from the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) were faced with a sen­tenc­ing dilemma in the first case of a new of­fence in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>An adult had per­mit­ted in­di­vid­u­als un­der 21 to con­sume a drug in her pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Noor Fad­hi­lah Azlan, 28, pleaded guilty to one count of this of­fence as well as other drug- and Cus­toms-re­lated charges.</p>
    <p>She had of­fered drugs to three ju­ve­niles last year. Two of them were 14 years old at the time while the third was 13.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion team could not rely on past cases when propos­ing a sen­tence, as the of­fence was in­tro­duced only on Aug 1 last year when amend­ments to the Mis­use of Drugs Act took ef­fect.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the team for­mu­lated a sen­tenc­ing frame­work for the of­fence, which con­sisted of guide­lines on the ap­pro­pri­ate pun­ish­ment based on rel­e­vant fac­tors, and re­lied on it to pro­pose a sen­tence of at least 36 months’ jail.</p>
    <p>The AGC did the same in the cases of Takaaki Ma­sui and Kat­su­toshi Ishibe, on which Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn wrote a judg­ment dated Dec 2. The two men had ap­pealed to the High Court against their jail sen­tences for cor­rup­tion of­fences.</p>
    <p>The three cases were among those in which the AGC pro­posed sen­tenc­ing frame­works as part of its prac­tice of as­sist­ing the courts in crim­i­nal mat­ters.</p>
    <p>While var­i­ous statutes set out the range of pun­ish­ment for of­fences, they do not in­clude guide­lines to fol­low when sen­tenc­ing each of­fender.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a per­son guilty of out­rag­ing some­one’s mod­esty can be jailed for up to two years, or fined, or caned un­der the Pe­nal Code. He may also face any com­bi­na­tion of the pun­ish­ments.</p>
    <p>But the Pe­nal Code does not spec­ify sit­u­a­tions where a jail term would be more suit­able than a fine or can­ing, among other things.</p>
    <p>It also does not state fac­tors to con­sider when de­cid­ing the du­ra­tion of the jail term.</p>
    <p>“Con­ven­tion­ally, the AGC has looked to sen­tenc­ing prece­dents for guid­ance on how a later case should be sen­tenced,” said Chief Pros­e­cu­tor Kow Keng Siong.</p>
    <p>But this ap­proach is not al­ways pos­si­ble or help­ful in some sit­u­a­tions, such as when the of­fence is new, as in Noor Fad­hi­lah’s case, or when the sen­tences in pre­vi­ous cases ap­pear to be in­con­sis­tent with one an­other.</p>
    <p>With­out a clear set of holis­tic guide­lines, sen­tenc­ing could end up be­ing highly sub­jec­tive and even ar­bi­trary. It is also com­mon for judges to ask the pros­e­cu­tion for its views on the ap­pro­pri­ate sen­tence for an of­fence, said Mr Kow.</p>
    <p>“In some cases, the pros­e­cu­tion has found it help­ful to de­velop sen­tenc­ing frame­works that take into ac­count and ra­tio­nalise the sen­tenc­ing prece­dents,” he said.</p>
    <p>The frame­works, which dif­fer for each of­fence, would as­sist the AGC in tak­ing a con­sis­tent and prin­ci­pled ap­proach when propos­ing sen­tences for sim­i­lar of­fences.</p>
    <p>A sen­tenc­ing frame­work would also be use­ful to have “at the very start”, if an in­crease in cases of the same of­fence is ex­pected in the near fu­ture, said Mr Kow.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple would be the sen­tenc­ing frame­work for first-time breaches of Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions that was first pro­posed in the case of 56-year-old Christo­pher Aru­mutham in May.</p>
    <p>He was one of the first few peo­ple charged with breach­ing the rules that were in­tro­duced in April. He was jailed 11 weeks for his of­fence and other crimes, in­clud­ing us­ing crim­i­nal force on a po­lice of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The frame­work, which sets out fines for less se­vere breaches and jail terms for more se­ri­ous ones, has been ap­plied when deal­ing with sub­se­quent of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>They in­clude seven peo­ple who breached Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions at Robert­son Quay in May, and eight in­di­vid­u­als who were part of an il­le­gal 12-per­son gath­er­ing at Lazarus Is­land on Aug 8.</p>
    <p>The seven of­fend­ers were fined be­tween $8,000 and $9,000, while the eight in­di­vid­u­als were fined $3,000 each.</p>
    <p>In for­mu­lat­ing a sen­tenc­ing frame­work, the AGC takes into ac­count var­i­ous con­sid­er­a­tions, such as hav­ing no “sud­den un­ex­plain­able jumps or gaps” in the penalty of an of­fence as its sever­ity level in­creases.</p>
    <p>The start­ing sen­tence for the most se­vere level of the of­fence would also be lower than the max­i­mum penalty, to give room for an in­crease in pun­ish­ment if there are ag­gra­vat­ing fac­tors. It is typ­i­cally set at two-thirds or three-quar­ters of the max­i­mum pre­scribed sen­tence, said Mr Kow.</p>
    <p>Such method­ol­ogy is based on sev­eral pat­terns that the AGC has ob­served in struc­tured sen­tenc­ing guide­lines con­tained in var­i­ous judg­ments, of which about 80 have been is­sued since 2013.</p>
    <p>Mr Kow said each sen­tenc­ing frame­work un­der­goes rig­or­ous stress-test­ing with a team of pros­e­cu­tors be­fore it is sub­mit­ted be­fore the court.</p>
    <p>But the AGC does not pro­pose sen­tenc­ing frame­works for every case. In most sit­u­a­tions, the pros­e­cu­tor can rely on pre­vi­ous cases if they are con­sis­tent.</p>
    <p>It is also the j udge who ul­ti­mately de­cides the sen­tence, as judges are not obliged to ac­cept the AGC’s pro­posed frame­works.</p>
    <p>“On oc­ca­sions, they have es­tab­lished sen­tenc­ing frame­works that take into ac­count dif­fer­ent con­sid­er­a­tions,” Mr Kow said.</p>
    <p>In other in­stances, judges have ex­pressly ac­cepted the AGC’s pro­posed frame­works.</p>
    <p>The court in Noor Fad­hi­lah’s case even­tu­ally de­cided on a jail term of two years and six months for the new of­fence, bring­ing her to­tal sen­tence to seven years and nine months’ jail with a fine of $10,300.</p>
    <p>“The dis­trict judge did not dis­agree with the sen­tenc­ing method­ol­ogy, although she im­posed a slightly lower sen­tence even­tu­ally, due to the man­ner (in which) she cal­i­brated some of the sen­tenc­ing fac­tors,” said Mr Kow.</p>
    <p>For the cases in­volv­ing Ja­panese na­tion­als Ma­sui and Ishibe, Jus­tice Chan chose to for­mu­late his own sen­tenc­ing frame­work for pri­vate sec­tor cor­rup­tion of­fences.</p>
    <p>He came up with a mod­i­fied ver­sion of the typ­i­cal ma­trix set­ting out nine sen­tenc­ing ranges, and in­cluded a sec­tion to ac­count for ex­treme lev­els of harm and cul­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the frame­work in the cases be­fore him, he ruled that the orig­i­nal sen­tences were man­i­festly ex­ces­sive and re­duced them, but he also added a fine.</p>
    <p>Mr Kow said that sen­tenc­ing is “not a science”, with each party to a case – pros­e­cu­tor, de­fence lawyer, judge and the ac­cused per­son – pos­si­bly hav­ing dif­fer­ent views on what sen­tence should be im­posed.</p>
    <p>But what is im­por­tant is to first prop­erly un­der­stand the facts of a case be­fore com­ment­ing on whether the sen­tence im­posed is ap­pro­pri­ate, he said.</p>
    <p>“It is hu­man na­ture to some­times draw in­fer­ences when look­ing at a set of facts. That said, it is un­wise to form a strong opin­ion about a mat­ter based sim­ply on in­fer­ences and spec­u­la­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Kow said that all par­ties in a case are “do­ing their best to per­form their job”.</p>
    <p>“And our job, ba­si­cally, is to pur­sue jus­tice in a way that is fair to both ac­cused per­sons and vic­tims alike,” he said.</p>
