    <p>Here are the schemes and cour­ses that en­abled Mrs Kousalya Sel­vaku­mar to skill up and move up.</p>
    <p>Nurs­ing at ITE</p>
    <p>The Nitec course in nurs­ing com­prises two com­po­nents – 15 months of full-time train­ing at ITE Col­lege East and nine months of su­per­vised clin­i­cal at­tach­ment at healthcare in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­plet­ing the course, grad­u­ates can regis­ter with the Singapore Nurs­ing Board as en­rolled nurses and be em­ployed at var­i­ous healthcare or­gan­i­sa­tions and hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>En­rolled nurses work as an in­te­gral part of the healthcare team to as­sess, plan, im­ple­ment and eval­u­ate nurs­ing care for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­ates may also ap­ply to en­ter a re­lated diploma course at the poly­tech­nics if they at­tain a grade point aver­age of 3.0 and above.</p>
    <p>The Early Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise for ITE stu­dents seek­ing to en­ter polytech­nic is a dis­cre­tionary ad­mis­sion ex­er­cise whereby stu­dents can ap­ply for a course of their choice be­fore their fi­nal-year re­sults are re­leased.</p>
    <p>It is open to fi­nal-year ITE stu­dents who have com­pleted their Nitec or Higher Nitec course.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants will need to demon­strate in­ter­est in and ap­ti­tude rel­e­vant to the polytech­nic course.</p>
    <p>They can choose up to three cour­ses and sub­mit a write-up de­tail­ing their ap­ti­tude for the se­lected cour­ses. Those short­listed will be in­vited for an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Fi­nal se­lec­tion is based on the in­ter­view per­for­mance and port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Nurs­ing at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic</p>
    <p>The nurs­ing diploma pro­gramme at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic boasts 38 weeks of clin­i­cal at­tach­ments in dif­fer­ent spe­cial­i­ties right from Year 1, giv­ing stu­dents plenty of ex­pe­ri­ence and ex­po­sure even be­fore grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>It also ex­poses stu­dents to the life sciences and pro­vides them with op­por­tu­ni­ties for over­seas im­mer­sion trips, in­tern­ships and ser­vice­learn­ing trips.</p>
    <p>Upon grad­u­a­tion, stu­dents can regis­ter with the Singapore Nurs­ing Board to be a li­censed pro­fes­sional nurse, and can prac­tise in both the gov­ern­ment and pri­vate healthcare set­tings, in­clud­ing at hos­pi­tals, poly­clin­ics and com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals. They can also work in pal­lia­tive care.</p>
    <p>Some have gone on to work with or­gan­i­sa­tions in­volved in clin­i­cal re­search tri­als and other health and ed­u­ca­tion-re­lated fields.</p>
    <p>Many also go on to pur­sue de­grees in ac­cred­ited uni­ver­si­ties both lo­cally and over­seas. For ex­am­ple, Ngee Ann Polytech­nic’s nurs­ing grad­u­ates have been ad­mit­ted di­rectly into the sec­ond year of the nurs­ing de­gree course at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore. Last year, 40 grad­u­ates se­cured places for this de­gree pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, grad­u­ates can choose to fur­ther their knowl­edge in a par­tic­u­lar field by tak­ing up ad­vanced diplo­mas such as in chronic dis­ease man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>There is also the Bach­e­lor of Science with Hon­ours in Nurs­ing at the Singapore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (SIT). The two-year post-reg­is­tra­tion pro­gramme is jointly of­fered by SIT and the Univer­sity of Glas­gow.</p>
