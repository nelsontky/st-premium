    <p>FRANK­FURT • Deutsche Lufthansa warned that com­pul­sory dis­missals are likely in Ger­many amid slow progress in talks with unions, stiff­en­ing its tone as the car­rier braces it­self for years of re­duced de­mand.</p>
    <p>Europe’s big­gest air­line posted a net loss of €1.5 bil­lion (S$2.4 bil­lion) in the sec­ond quar­ter as the coro­n­avirus pandemic slammed the brakes on travel.</p>
    <p>Lufthansa has set a goal of slash­ing head­count by about 22,000 as it trims its fleet by at least 100 planes to clamp down on ex­penses and pay back some €9 bil­lion in Ger­man aid.</p>
    <p>“We are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a re­set­ting in global air traf­fic,” chief ex­ec­u­tive Carsten Spohr said in a re­lease. “We do not ex­pect de­mand to re­turn to pre-cri­sis lev­els be­fore 2024.”</p>
    <p>Lufthansa’s work­force is down 8,300 from a year ago, it said in a state­ment yes­ter­day. It has al­ready de­tailed moves to cut 20 per cent of man­age­ment and 1,000 of­fice posts.</p>
    <p>Avoid­ing forced re­dun­dan­cies is no longer re­al­is­tic even in Ger­many, where the com­pany had planned to rely on vol­un­tary de­par­tures, given the re­duc­tion in de­mand and the slow pace of labour ne­go­ti­a­tions, Mr Spohr said.</p>
    <p>Lufthansa has not yet de­liv­ered on an ear­lier pack­age of mea­sures, said Mr Ni­co­ley Baublies, man­ag­ing direc­tor of the UFO cabin-crew union.</p>
    <p>“There are two op­tions now: Ei­ther we carry this pack­age over the line to­gether, or we must push through Lufthansa’s nec­es­sary prom­ises by dis­pute. To threaten forced re­dun­dan­cies is not nec­es­sary, and is even vi­o­lat­ing con­tracts as far as cabin crew are con­cerned,” he said.</p>
    <p>He re­ported strong progress in rene­go­ti­at­ing the air­craft-de­liv­ery sched­ule and ad­justed pay­ments with man­u­fac­tur­ers Air­bus and Boe­ing.</p>
    <p>Lufthansa said earn­ings will be clearly neg­a­tive in the sec­ond half of the year, with a fur­ther sig­nif­i­cant de­cline in the full-year fig­ure, af­ter los­ing €2.9 bil­lion in the first half. Cash flow will not turn pos­i­tive un­til some time next year.</p>
    <p>The re­port fol­lows huge losses re­ported last week by Lufthansa’s big­gest ri­vals. Bri­tish Air­ways owner IAG re­ported a record loss of €1.36 bil­lion, more than the big­gest short­fall it pre­vi­ously suf­fered in a year, while Air France-KLM had a €2.61 bil­lion deficit.</p>
    <p>Lufthansa is cur­rently of­fer­ing about 40 per cent of its usual short­haul ca­pac­ity and 20 per cent on long-haul routes. Those fig­ures will in­crease to around 55 per cent and 50 per cent, re­spec­tively, in the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man car­rier is be­ing sad­dled with a moun­tain of debt and higher in­ter­est pay­ments af­ter tap­ping €9 bil­lion in gov­ern­ment aid to avoid in­sol­vency, of which it has re­ceived €2.3 bil­lion since the start of last month.</p>
