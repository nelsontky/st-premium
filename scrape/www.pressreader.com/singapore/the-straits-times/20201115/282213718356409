    <p>Or­chard Road is bet­ter known for play, rather than work, but head to Opus Bar and Grill at Hil­ton Sin­ga­pore if you want to give pro­duc­tiv­ity lev­els a boost. Pre­vi­ously used as an ex­ten­sion to the ho­tel’s buf­fet lunch venue for guests to have meet­ings, it was launched as a co-work­ing space in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>OF­FICE FOR THE DAY</p>
    <p>With a max­i­mum ca­pac­ity of just 19 guests, book ahead to se­cure your ta­ble – the ho­tel rec­om­mends two days in ad­vance. About 15 other guests came and went on the week­day after­noon The Straits Times vis­ited.</p>
    <p>Plush couches and arm­chairs have pow­er­points nearby, but some reg­u­lar ta­bles and chairs do not. The for­mer is com­fort­able if you are stay­ing only an hour or two, but hard-backed chairs do bet­ter at staving off the post-lunch slump.</p>
    <p>For more pri­vacy, go for ta­bles lo­cated closer to the bar, rather than those that ex­tend into the ho­tel lobby.</p>
    <p>Co-work­ing hours end at 5pm, when staff gussy up ta­bles for the restau­rant’s din­ner ser­vice. Those who need to clock over­time will have to re­lo­cate to Star­bucks down the road.</p>
    <p>FEEL­ING PECKISH?</p>
    <p>Ei­ther a break­fast set or two-course lunch is in­cluded in the pack­age, along with a free flow of cof­fee and tea.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant restau­rant man­ager Joel Mathias says most pa­trons opt for lunch, and rec­om­mends the tan­doori chicken wrap. It is light yet flavour­ful, ac­com­pa­nied by a tangy mint sauce and a serv­ing of thick­cut fries.</p>
    <p>Choose ei­ther a starter or dessert to ac­com­pany your main. If you are feel­ing vir­tu­ous, the cae­sar salad is a safe bet.</p>
    <p>My pick, how­ever, is dessert. Tiramisu and cho­co­late cake jars, pe­tite yet in­dul­gent, are both solid choices. The for­mer is moist and boozy, while the lat­ter, made with Val­rhona cho­co­late, is an in­dul­gent treat.</p>
    <p>PERKS</p>
    <p>Be­sides food and drinks, guests get free park­ing for the day and a 30 per cent dis­count off the a la carte menu.</p>
