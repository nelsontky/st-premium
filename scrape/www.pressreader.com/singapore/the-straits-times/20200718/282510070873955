    <p>• Fans are set to re­turn to sports sta­di­ums, in­clud­ing the Pre­mier League, in Oc­to­ber af­ter a se­ries of test events start­ing later this month, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mass gath­er­ings have been banned since March as part of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures en­acted to com­bat the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But, as Mr John­son set out the next stage of the re­cov­ery road map for Bri­tain, he said his gov­ern­ment was work­ing to­wards a re­turn of spec­ta­tors for pro sports.</p>
    <p>“We will pi­lot larger gath­er­ings in venues such as sports sta­dia with a view to a wider re­open­ing in the au­tumn,” he said at a Down­ing Street brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“From Oc­to­ber, we in­tend to bring back au­di­ences in sta­dia and al­low con­fer­ences and other busi­ness events to recom­mence. Again, these changes must be done in a Covid-19-se­cure way, sub­ject to the suc­cess­ful out­come of pi­lots.”</p>
    <p>The July 31-Aug 16 World Snooker Cham­pi­onship, the Glo­ri­ous Good­wood horse rac­ing fes­ti­val (July 28-Aug 1) and two county cricket friendly matches will be among the pi­lot events.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment added the “events have been care­fully se­lected to rep­re­sent a range of sports and in­door and out­door spec­ta­tor en­vi­ron­ments”.</p>
    <p>On the de­ci­sion to let fans back in, Sports Min­is­ter Nigel Hud­dle­ston ac­knowl­edged that for many sports, fans were their “lifeblood”.</p>
    <p>“Al­though it will re­main some time be­fore venues are full to ca­pac­ity, this is a ma­jor step in the right di­rec­tion for the re­sump­tion of live spec­ta­tor sport across the coun­try,” he said.</p>
    <p>While broad­cast rev­enue forms the bulk of the Pre­mier League’s in­come, match-day rev­enue still ac­counts for a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Sun, Manch­ester United raked in £111 mil­lion (S$193.4 mil­lion) in the 2018-19 sea­son from match-day rev­enue – more than any other English topflight club – fol­lowed by Ar­se­nal at £96 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Pre­mier League chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Richard Mas­ters has said that top-flight clubs are keen to act as “test pi­lots” for any ex­per­i­ments around a phased re­open­ing of sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>Teams will not be al­lowed to fill their sta­di­ums to full ca­pac­ity from the start, but the Daily Mail yes­ter­day said that clubs have be­gun “can­vass­ing fans to gauge opin­ion”.</p>
    <p>In Thurs­day’s league games, fifth-placed United beat Crys­tal Palace 2-0, cour­tesy of goals from Mar­cus Rash­ford and An­thony Mar­tial, to keep the pres­sure on Le­ices­ter, who held on to fourth af­ter de­feat­ing Sh­effield United 2-0.</p>
    <p>The two sides are sep­a­rated only by goal dif­fer­ence and, with just two games re­main­ing, a top-four spot and Cham­pi­ons League qual­i­fi­ca­tion looks likely to be set­tled only on the fi­nal day to­mor­row week, when the Foxes host the Red Devils.</p>
