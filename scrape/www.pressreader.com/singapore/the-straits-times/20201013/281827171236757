    <p>MEL­BOURNE/SYD­NEY The virus that causes Covid-19 can sur­vive on ban­knotes, glass and stain­less steel for up to 28 days, much longer than the flu virus, Aus­tralian re­searchers said yes­ter­day, high­light­ing the need for clean­ing and hand wash­ing to fight the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Find­ings from the study by Aus­tralia’s na­tional sci­ence agency, the Com­mon­wealth Sci­en­tific and In­dus­trial Re­search Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Csiro), ap­pear to show that in a very con­trolled en­vi­ron­ment, the virus was in­fec­tious for longer than other stud­ies have found.</p>
    <p>Csiro re­searchers found that at 20 deg C, the Sars-Cov-2 virus re­mained in­fec­tious for 28 days on smooth sur­faces such as plas­tic ban­knotes and glass found on mo­bile phone screens. The study was pub­lished in Virol­ogy Jour­nal.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, the in­fluenza A virus has been found to sur­vive on sur­faces for 17 days.</p>
    <p>Lead re­searcher Shane Rid­dell said: “It re­ally re­in­forces the im­por­tance of wash­ing hands and sani­tis­ing where pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Paul Di­gard, a virol­ogy spe­cial­ist at Bri­tain’s Ed­in­burgh Univer­sity Roslin In­sti­tute, said it was sig­nif­i­cant that the re­searchers had mea­sured in­fec­tious virus, not just de­tectable bits of virus, but added that it was also key to re­mem­ber the virus’ in­fec­tiv­ity de­cays over time.</p>
    <p>“So the amount of virus sur­viv­ing at 28 days is very low and is there­fore likely to be much less likely to in­fect some­one than the higher amounts present when the virus is freshly de­posited,” he said.</p>
    <p>The study in­volved dry­ing the virus in an ar­ti­fi­cial mu­cus on a range of sur­faces at con­cen­tra­tions sim­i­lar to sam­ples from Covid-19 pa­tients and then re­cov­er­ing the virus over a month.</p>
    <p>Ex­per­i­ments car­ried out showed that the virus sur­vived longer at cooler tem­per­a­tures, longer on smooth sur­faces than on com­plex sur­faces like cot­ton, and longer on pa­per ban­knotes than on plas­tic ban­knotes.</p>
    <p>The per­sis­tence on glass is an im­por­tant find­ing, given that touch­screen de­vices such as mo­bile phones, bank ATMs, su­per­mar­ket self-serve check-outs and air­port check-in kiosks are high touch sur­faces which may not be reg­u­larly cleaned and there­fore pose a trans­mis­sion risk of Sars-Cov-2, the re­searchers said in the pa­per.</p>
