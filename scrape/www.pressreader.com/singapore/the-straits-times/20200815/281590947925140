    <p>Sport’s real test is the mas­tery over time, and not even Nostradamu­s armed with a pot of tea leaves can proph­esy that. Let us not say what PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner Collin Morikawa will be, but watch de­light­edly what he can be, says colum­nist Ro­hit Bri­j­nath.</p>
    <p>In May 1974, a 24-year-old rock­ing poet plays at Har­vard Square The­ater and Jon Lan­dau, then a mu­sic critic, fa­mously writes: “I saw rock ’n’ roll fu­ture and its name is Bruce Spring­steen.”</p>
    <p>Forty-two years later, Spring­steen would write in his au­to­bi­og­ra­phy, Born To Run, “as help­ful and bur­den­some (in the long run, more help­ful I would say) as ‘the quote heard round the world’ was...”</p>
    <p>Point is, even when pre­dic­tions are help­ful they’re trou­ble­some, they can open doors yet be a weight, they shine a light on tal­ent yet the scru­tiny never goes away. You al­ways have to be what some­one else has de­cided for you. The Next Some­body. The New Su­per­star. The Can’t-Miss Kid.</p>
    <p>We’re ob­sessed with anoint­ing he­roes and de­cid­ing their fu­ture and yet the test of tal­ent is longevity and it is be­yond read­ing. The beauty of sport is that it’s un­read­able and yet we in­sist on turn­ing into gush­ing prophets. It is one thing to ven­er­ate an act of skill, it is an­other to over-read it. One chap­ter never makes an epic.</p>
    <p>And so PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner Collin Morikawa, with his win­ning smile, bet­ter be tough be­cause he’s al­ready the Next One. The Ma­jor Tal­ent. The New Era. Last Sun­day he be­came a “megas­tar” and one com­men­ta­tor de­clared his drive on the 16th might be “the shot of the decade”. Vic­tory, al­most in­evitably, was fol­lowed by ex­ag­ger­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The thing about sport is that it mocks prophecy and jeers at fore­casts. This is par­tic­u­larly true of golf, for it is a finicky jig­saw, full of tech­ni­cal bits and psy­cho­log­i­cal crutches, where a sin­gle mis­placed piece can ruin it all. The game rebels against be­ing owned by any­one. Even Tigers oc­ca­sion­ally get stopped in their tracks.</p>
    <p>Play­ers change clubs like Rory McIl­roy, who is six years from his last Ma­jor, and strug­gle. They fid­dle with a swing and plum­met. Luke Don­ald, No. 1 in 2012 and No. 919 in 2019, told the Guardian that “a year and a half on from be­ing the best player in the world I was chang­ing swing coaches. It set me back”.</p>
    <p>In­jury vis­its and form leaks away, cad­dies are sacked and bod­ies al­ter shape. It’s never one thing, but slumps be­gin with a small push down a slope of no con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Ly­dia Ko, once Mozart with an iron, won nine tour­na­ments in 2015-16 but only one in the 31/ years</p>
    <p>2 since. Ev­ery­one has a the­ory and for her former coach, David Lead­bet­ter, it was partly par­ent­ing.</p>
    <p>Last year he told New Zealand’s Ra­dio Sport: “They tell her when to go to bed, what to eat, what to wear, when to prac­tise and what to prac­tise. And they ex­pect her to win ev­ery tour­na­ment. They need to let her go, let her fly.”</p>
    <p>How to win is a some­time thing, not an all-time gift. The de­light­ful Tseng Yani won five Ma­jors be­tween 2008 and 2011 but has since missed the cut in 19 Ma­jors. Only 31 now, she is ranked No. 779, and who could have fore­cast this?</p>
    <p>The un­known of sport is its ap­peal­ing mys­tery. Morikawa ap­pears to own the calm of an ac­tu­ary, yet we have no idea how he’d re­spond at a nor­mal Ma­jor, in front of swollen crowds who bring a suf­fo­cat­ing ten­sion. These are the joy­ous dis­cov­er­ies of sport which defy pre­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>How will he man­age me­dia in­ter­ro­ga­tions, the flash of fame, the swell of ex­pec­ta­tion and the in­tru­sions into his time? Can he man­age praise as it en­velops him and have peo­ple there to ground him, like the great jazz trum­peter Wyn­ton Marsalis did?</p>
    <p>He told the BBC this year – laugh­ing as he re­counted the story – that when he won a Grammy at 22, his fa­ther El­lis, a jazz pi­anist, told him: “You don’t think this means you can play, do you?” Great­ness isn’t one al­bum or one tro­phy, it’s a body of work.</p>
    <p>This is the fun of tal­ent, isn’t it, watch­ing it grow, ex­press it­self, stum­ble, take risks? This is the thrill, isn’t it, watch­ing a ca­reer un­fold like the com­plex plot of a film in­stead of di­lut­ing it with easy over­state­ment?</p>
    <p>So give the kid a break and let him play. Let him be him­self and not some­one we want him to be. Sport’s real test is the mas­tery over time and not even Nostradamu­s armed with a pot of tea leaves can proph­esy that. Let’s not say what Morikawa will be but watch de­light­edly what he can be.</p>
    <p>One Ma­jor won doesn’t make him “great” yet, not in the au­then­tic definition of the word. “Great” has to be earned the long, hard, slow way and it can’t be given to one­self. Un­less, of course, your name is Ali.</p>
    <p>When, against the odds, Muham­mad Ali de­feated Sonny Lis­ton in his first ti­tle fight, he turned to dis­be­liev­ing re­porters and said: “Who’s the great­est?”</p>
    <p>Si­lent at first, a few fi­nally replied: “You are.”</p>
    <p>PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner Collin Morikawa, with his win­ning smile, bet­ter be tough be­cause he’s al­ready the Next One. The Ma­jor Tal­ent. The New Era.</p>
    <p>Last Sun­day he be­came a “megas­tar” and one com­men­ta­tor de­clared that his drive on the 16th might be “the shot of the decade”. Vic­tory, al­most in­evitably, was fol­lowed by ex­ag­ger­a­tion.</p>
