    <p>The prob­lem of in­creased car­bon emis­sions is just the tip of the ice­berg if Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) goes ahead with plans to launch “flights to nowhere”, said en­vi­ron­men­tal groups.</p>
    <p>Such flights are dif­fi­cult to jus­tify be­cause they do not pro­vide trans­port to any des­ti­na­tion, they added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, eco-groups said they un­der­stood that SIA is now fac­ing tough times amid the eco­nomic head­winds wrought by the Covid-19 cri­sis, and it re­cently car­ried out a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>To help the car­rier ex­plore other op­tions, mem­bers of a few green groups are gath­er­ing al­ter­na­tive ideas from the pub­lic, to help SIA gen­er­ate in­come.</p>
    <p>Ms Chevon Low, 30, a mem­ber of en­vi­ron­men­tal non-profit group PM Haze and one of four peo­ple in­volved in the ef­fort, said they have re­ceived more than 1,000 re­sponses since last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>She said: “We’re heart­ened to have re­ceived so many in­ter­est­ing and in­no­va­tive sug­ges­tions in just a few days, which re­flects the pub­lic’s strong sup­port for both the en­vi­ron­ment and our na­tional air­line.</p>
    <p>“We will com­pile the ideas and send them to SIA chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong. We hope SIA will con­sider these sug­ges­tions, es­pe­cially since they are crowd­sourced.”</p>
    <p>Ideas can be sub­mit­ted at bit.ly/saveSIA till Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, The Straits Times re­ported that SIA is plan­ning to launch a flights-to-nowhere cam­paign, with each flight tak­ing about three hours. On Mon­day, in re­sponse to queries, SIA said it is con­sid­er­ing sev­eral ini­tia­tives, and re­it­er­ated that “none of these plans have been firmed up”.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Win­ston Chow, a cli­mate sci­en­tist at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, said ev­ery litre of jet fuel burned re­leases 3.16kg of car­bon diox­ide (CO2), which con­trib­utes to the green­house ef­fect that causes global warm­ing and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>But how much jet fuel is burned de­pends on the type of air­craft, the pas­sen­ger and cargo load, and the dis­tance trav­elled, he added.</p>
    <p>Newer planes such as the A-350 and Boe­ing 787 are more fuel ef­fi­cient, and a typ­i­cal flight last­ing about two to three hours will pro­duce an equiv­a­lent of 38 tonnes to 57 tonnes of CO2, he said. It will be lower if planes carry no cargo, which is likely with flights to nowhere.</p>
    <p>If Sin­ga­pore’s car­bon emis­sions are about 50 mil­lion tonnes a year, and as­sum­ing each flight emits 50 tonnes of CO2 on av­er­age, 150 flights from Oc­to­ber to De­cem­ber will emit 7,500 tonnes of CO2 – 0.015 per cent of to­tal cur­rent na­tional emis­sions, said Prof Chow.</p>
    <p>In any case, there is more ur­gency to con­trol emis­sions from other more detri­men­tal sources, such as burn­ing non-re­new­able fuels for power, he said.</p>
    <p>Some en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists said flights to nowhere have no jus­ti­fi­able pur­pose. Mr Eric Bea, an en­vi­ron­men­tal law re­searcher at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, said: “Or­di­nar­ily, these planes trans­port peo­ple and cargo from place to place, serv­ing an es­sen­tial so­cioe­co­nomic role.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the emis­sions gen­er­ated from these flights to nowhere, though small, do not pro­vide es­sen­tial trans­port ser­vices, as op­posed to emis­sions that are pro­duc­tive, like the con­ver­sion of pas­sen­ger air­craft to cargo, which may be used to move crit­i­cal cargo.”</p>
    <p>He added that pro­duc­ing and later i ncin­er­at­ing used i n-flight ameni­ties, such as face masks and sur­face wipes, also adds to car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal group SG Cli­mate Rally said the flights to nowhere con­cept is a “stop-gap mea­sure that dis­tracts from the pol­icy and value shifts nec­es­sary to mit­i­gate the cli­mate cri­sis”. It added that “the onus is on SIA ex­ec­u­tives and pol­i­cy­mak­ers to pivot towards more sus­tain­able and eq­ui­table al­ter­na­tives for its cus­tomers and staff”.</p>
