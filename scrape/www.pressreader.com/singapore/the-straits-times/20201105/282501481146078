    <p>Hopes of a de­ci­sive out­come to the US election melted away dur­ing the Asian trad­ing ses­sion, rais­ing con­cerns that a much needed stim­u­lus pro­gramme will not be quickly passed on Capi­tol Hill.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephane Monier, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer at Swiss pri­vate bank Lom­bard Odier, said just be­fore the end of trad­ing in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day: “It’s far too close to call, but right now, it is clear that the Demo­crat land­slide sug­gested by polling is just not ma­te­ri­al­is­ing.</p>
    <p>“For now, who­ever wins the White House, it very much looks like we will face a di­vided Congress. This has far-reach­ing im­pli­ca­tions for mar­kets, mostly be­cause it means that any kind of pan­demic re­cov­ery pack­age is still tough to ap­prove.”</p>
    <p>In­vestors in Sin­ga­pore were hardly in full re­treat though.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) ended yes­ter­day 18.76 points, or 0.75 per cent, higher.</p>
    <p>Leading the in­dex with gains of more than 2 per cent each were Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust, Sing­tel and Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spec­trum,</p>
    <p>the big­gest in­dex lag­gards yes­ter­day were Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries and Cap­i­taLand In­te­grated Com­mer­cial Trust, which de­clined by more than 1 per cent each.</p>
    <p>Also among the i ndex losers were heavy­weight prop­erty devel­op­ers City De­vel­op­ments and Cap­i­taLand, which de­clined 0.93 per cent and 0.39 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Across the broader mar­ket, ad­vancers and de­clin­ers were al­most evenly matched at 208 to 205. The most ac­tively traded counter was Jiu­tian Chem­i­cal, which had nearly 406.7 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands. The stock rose 5.16 per cent, and closed at 10.2 cents.</p>
    <p>Re­gion­ally, Hong Kong fell 0.2 per cent, as Alibaba tum­bled after China suspended the planned list­ing of its fi­nan­cial unit Ant Group.</p>
    <p>But South Korea rose 0.6 per cent, while Ja­pan fin­ished 1.72 per cent up.</p>
