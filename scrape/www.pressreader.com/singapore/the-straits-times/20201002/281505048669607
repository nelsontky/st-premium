    <p>What is the best test of whether your chil­dren like what they wear?</p>
    <p>Take them to the play­ground and watch them play, says Mrs Iris Ramos of lo­cally based la­bel Dux­ton Kids, which she started with her hus­band.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally great with chil­dren be­cause they don’t even have to tell you – if they take the clothes off im­me­di­ately, you know they don’t like it. It’s the eas­i­est fo­cus group you could ever have,” says the mother of two drolly.</p>
    <p>Such is how she and her hus­band, Mr Dustin Ramos, de­cide what kind of cloth­ing to pro­duce for their la­bel. They dress their daugh­ters – Matilda, three, and Macken­zie, one – in sam­ples and let the girls’ ac­tions speak for them­selves.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren’s cloth­ing was not al­ways front of mind for the Amer­i­can en­trepreneur­s, both 39, who came to Sin­ga­pore in 2013.</p>
    <p>Launched in March last year, Dux­ton Kids is an off­shoot of their orig­i­nal ven­ture – menswear brand Dux­ton – which they started in 2018 and which has a store in Dux­ton Road. They quickly di­ver­si­fied af­ter be­com­ing par­ents, says Mrs Ramos.</p>
    <p>“It was just made ap­par­ent right when we had chil­dren our­selves that, oh, we cre­ate these re­ally com­fort­able clothes for men – so why don’t we do the same for chil­dren?”</p>
    <p>More­over, it was hard to find ca­sual wear for kids that was func­tional for the play­ground but still “fun and cool”.</p>
    <p>So they made their own. They started man­u­fac­tur­ing in Los An­ge­les, where the menswear is still made, and later moved pro­duc­tion to Bali with a small team that earns fair wages.</p>
    <p>As par­ents, they found they could bet­ter un­der­stand de­sign­ing chil­dren’s cloth­ing. They heeded their daugh­ters’ feed­back and chose fab­rics that do not re­strict their move­ments or make them sweat.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing “par­ent-proof” cloth­ing was another pri­or­ity. Hus­bands – in­clud­ing her own – some­times strug­gle with cer­tain but­tons or clasps for lit­tle girls’ dresses, says Mrs Ramos with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“And what we found in the be­gin­ning, when we put clothes on our chil­dren, was that the scari­est part is putting some­thing over a baby’s head – be­cause for a cou­ple of sec­onds, they can’t see; or if it’s too tight, they can’t breathe.”</p>
    <p>Most of their dresses are hence wrap dresses, and T-shirts that re­quire go­ing over the head are made with soft, stretchy fab­rics like bam­boo span­dex. Some are made from the same print fab­rics, sourced in Ja­pan, used to make Dux­ton’s menswear pieces.</p>
    <p>The clothes are priced from $36 for a shirt to $72 for a dress, and sizes run from one­sies to those for fiveyear-olds.</p>
    <p>Their next col­lec­tion, called Fight Like A Girl, which launches in two months, will fea­ture a se­ries of graphic and slo­gan tees pay­ing homage to strong women. The first fea­tures the late US Supreme Court Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, who died two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>“As par­ents, I want our chil­dren to see these re­ally amaz­ing im­ages and themes from an early age,” says Mrs Ramos, who plans to re­lease tees with strong male fig­ures in the fu­ture too.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness has been en­cour­ag­ing post-cir­cuit breaker, with the cou­ple due to open a sec­ond store at 21 Yong Siak Street next month.</p>
    <p>While Dux­ton Kids started off as a pas­sion project, it now ac­counts for about 40 per cent of the busi­ness. And their clien­tele, once mostly ex­pa­tri­ates, are now half lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ramos has also no­ticed that most of the Dux­ton Kids cus­tomers are young par­ents shop­ping for their first child.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sure why – maybe you al­ways kind of at­tract peo­ple go­ing through the same ex­pe­ri­ences,” she reck­ons.</p>
    <p>“At first, we just wanted to de­sign great clothes for our kids. But as more mums and dads buy our col­lec­tions, we got to know them bet­ter and fig­ure out what they’re look­ing for.”</p>
