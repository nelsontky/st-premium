    <p>SEOUL • Fans of K-pop singer HyunA (right) may have to wait a lit­tle longer for her first stu­dio al­bum.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old singer was orig­i­nally plan­ning to launch her pre-re­lease sin­gle, Good Girl, on Wed­nes­day, ahead of her full stu­dio al­bum later this year.</p>
    <p>But the re­lease of the sin­gle has been put on hold as a re­sult of faint­ing spells suf­fered by HyunA, who made her de­but with girl group Won­der Girls in 2007. She is also a former mem­ber of girl group 4Minute.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, her agency P-Na­tion said: “It is with re­gret that the re­lease of HyunA’s Good Girl has been post­poned to a later date due to her on­go­ing med­i­cal con­di­tion (vaso­va­gal syn­cope).”</p>
    <p>The agency, which was founded by South Korean singer Psy, added: “At this time, we will fo­cus on pro­vid­ing HyunA with the med­i­cal at­ten­tion she needs and be with her through every step of her re­cov­ery process.”</p>
    <p>Vaso­va­gal syn­cope is a type of faint­ing spell caused by a fall in blood pres­sure due to de­hy­dra­tion or stand­ing for too long.</p>
    <p>HyunA, who is known glob­ally for her ap­pear­ance in the mu­sic video for Psy’s 2012 world­wide hit Gang­nam Style, dis­closed in Novem­ber last year that she suf­fered from de­pres­sion, panic disor­ders and vaso­va­gal syn­cope.</p>
    <p>The rev­e­la­tion came af­ter the deaths of singers Sulli last Oc­to­ber and Goo Hara last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>HyunA had also re­leased Flower Shower, her first sin­gle with P-Na­tion, in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>She left her long-time la­bel Cube Entertainm­ent af­ter go­ing pub­lic with her rap­per boyfriend Dawn, for­merly of boy band Pen­tagon, in 2018.</p>
