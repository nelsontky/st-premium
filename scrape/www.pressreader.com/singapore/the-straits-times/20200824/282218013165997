    <p>For in­vestors search­ing for pock­ets of stronger cer­tainty, the Asian credit mar­ket is prov­ing to be more re­silient than other mar­kets and as­set classes, par­tic­u­larly in the high-yield space.</p>
    <p>This comes down to a con­flu­ence of fac­tors.</p>
    <p>Asian economies, on av­er­age, have been more sta­ble than their coun­ter­parts in other parts of the world, largely due to the un­der­ly­ing eco­nomic ro­bust­ness, as well as strong and co­or­di­nated govern­ment pol­icy sup­port.</p>
    <p>China re­mains the key en­gine of growth in Asia. How­ever, the re­gion is also sup­ported by a num­ber of dy­namic, well-run economies through­out North and South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The com­bi­na­tion of a well-ed­u­cated, mo­ti­vated work­force, sen­si­ble eco­nomic pol­icy, low ex­ter­nal debt and gen­er­ally de­cent in­fra­struc­ture has cre­ated a for­mula of sta­ble eco­nomic growth for the re­gion. North Asia, fur­ther­more, en­joys a “first in – first out” po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments across Asia have also been swift and strong in their eco­nomic stim­u­lus mea­sures, in­clud­ing in­ter­est rate cuts, ex­tra liq­uid­ity in­jec­tions and tax cuts.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Singapore has been es­pe­cially proac­tive with fis­cal and mon­e­tary mea­sures aimed at help­ing peo­ple and com­pa­nies carry through this storm.</p>
    <p>While many in­vestors will be rightly con­cerned with the po­ten­tial for de­fault in these tur­bu­lent times, Asia cor­po­rates should be com­par­a­tively more shielded from these vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>First, Asia has a lower ex­po­sure to the most badly im­pacted sec­tors like oil and gas pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, many large en­ergy com­pa­nies, such as those in China, are state-owned en­ter­prises and as such, can ex­pect some sup­port from the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, a large por­tion of Asian high-yield bonds are com­prised of is­sues from Chi­nese prop­erty de­vel­op­ers, and most of the top 30 is­suers have al­ready raised funds to meet their near-term fi­nanc­ing needs. The re­duced re­fi­nanc­ing pres­sure means the chance of de­fault risk in the mar­ket is slim­mer.</p>
    <p>Thus, Asia credit may be sub­ject to idio­syn­cratic risk of in­di­vid­ual names rather than sys­temic risk of in­dus­tries, which is a con­trast to the sit­u­a­tion in the oil and re­tail sec­tors in the United States.</p>
    <p>AT­TRAC­TIVE YIELDS</p>
    <p>Af­ter the sub­stan­tial ad­just­ment in Asian dol­lar bonds ear­lier in the year, Asian high-yield bonds have be­come more at­trac­tive, with the av­er­age yields around 7.7 per cent. This cre­ates good in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in the Asian high-yield bond mar­ket.</p>
    <p>This is where pick­ing the right bonds can make all the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>With lower prices, in­vestors have the op­por­tu­nity to pur­chase as­sets at a sig­nif­i­cantly lower price. If they are able to avoid the bonds that might de­fault, they will be re­warded with at­trac­tive po­ten­tial re­turns later when the mar­ket re­cov­ers.</p>
    <p>And the re­cov­ery is un­der way. How­ever, there are pit­falls to look out for. A com­mon is­sue fac­ing bond mar­kets is liq­uid­ity – the abil­ity to buy and sell se­cu­ri­ties at will with­out ex­ces­sive bid of­fer spreads. Bonds are gen­er­ally not traded on ex­changes and are trans­acted bi­lat­er­ally be­tween in­de­pen­dent counter-par­ties.</p>
    <p>So when the mar­ket has more peo­ple in­tend­ing to sell, with very few in­vestors want­ing to buy, it is dif­fi­cult to match up buy­ers and sell­ers to en­sure a good two-way flow. This means that val­u­a­tion prices can get marked down vi­ciously as the clear­ing price in the mar­ket can be much lower than the fun­da­men­tal value of the se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>STILL NEED TO BE SE­LEC­TIVE</p>
    <p>Mean­while, if in­vestors can­not sell their riski­est bonds, they may be forced to sell some of their safer hold­ings. There­fore, from a credit risk per­spec­tive, a strong credit se­lec­tion process is im­por­tant to avoid bonds with the high­est risks in the mar­ket, and to con­cen­trate on bonds with a com­bi­na­tion of at­trac­tive yields and like­li­hood of cap­i­tal preser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are ways to cre­ate a cush­ion. Dur­ing the height of in­vestor con­cern in March, we in­creased the ex­po­sure to highly liq­uid US trea­sury bonds in our man­aged funds to not only dampen volatil­ity, but also to pro­vide a cush­ion of liq­uid­ity in case we faced mass re­quests for re­demp­tion.</p>
    <p>As it turned out, we didn’t face sig­nif­i­cant re­demp­tions and were able to re­turn the funds to more con­ven­tional po­si­tion­ing in April.</p>
    <p>While there is no doubt that the pan­demic has brought with it an era of un­cer­tainty and high volatil­ity, the com­bi­na­tion of rel­a­tively high yield but lower du­ra­tion of Asian credit mar­kets, which are also boosted by a his­tor­i­cally lower de­fault rate than vir­tu­ally any other ma­jor re­gion, makes the Asian credit mar­kets, and its high-yield seg­ment, in par­tic­u­lar, a bea­con of light for in­vestors who are look­ing for a steady ship among the tur­bu­lent seas of the cur­rent eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the sub­stan­tial ad­just­ment in Asian dol­lar bonds ear­lier in the year, Asian high-yield bonds have be­come more at­trac­tive, with the av­er­age yields around</p>
    <p>7.7 per cent. This cre­ates good in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in the Asian high-yield bond mar­ket. This is where pick­ing the right bonds can make all the dif­fer­ence. With lower prices, in­vestors have the op­por­tu­nity to pur­chase as­sets at a sig­nif­i­cantly lower price.</p>
