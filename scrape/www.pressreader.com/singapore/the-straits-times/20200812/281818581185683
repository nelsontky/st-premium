    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US Se­cret Ser­vice abruptly es­corted Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump out of the White House press room in the mid­dle of a brief­ing on Mon­day be­cause of a shoot­ing out­side the build­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­turned to the me­dia room sev­eral min­utes later and said a per­son had been shot by law en­force­ment and taken to the hos­pi­tal. He said he un­der­stood the sus­pect had been armed.</p>
    <p>“It was a shoot­ing out­side of the White House,” Mr Trump said. “It seems to be very well un­der con­trol... But there was an ac­tual shoot­ing and some­body has been taken to the hos­pi­tal. I don’t know the con­di­tion of the per­son.”</p>
    <p>He said the shoot­ing was near the fence at the edge of the White</p>
    <p>House grounds.</p>
    <p>The Se­cret Ser­vice said late on Mon­day that the White House was not breached dur­ing the in­ci­dent and no one un­der Se­cret Ser­vice pro­tec­tion was ever in dan­ger.</p>
    <p>It said in a tweet that “the in­ves­ti­ga­tion into a USSS of­fi­cer in­volved shoot­ing is on­go­ing. A male sub­ject and a USSS of­fi­cer were both trans­ported to a lo­cal hos­pi­tal. At no time dur­ing this in­ci­dent was the White House com­plex breached or were any pro­tectees in dan­ger”.</p>
    <p>The doors to the White House brief­ing room were locked shortly be­fore Mr Trump was es­corted out.</p>
    <p>No­body else was wounded in the shoot­ing, Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>He had been speak­ing about the stock mar­ket when a Se­cret Ser­vice agent in­ter­rupted him at the podium min­utes into the brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin and Of­fice of Man­age­ment and Bud­get di­rec­tor Russ Vought were also es­corted out of the room. Mr Trump told re­porters he was taken to the Oval Of­fice, which is in the West Wing near the brief­ing room, af­ter be­ing es­corted out.</p>
