    </section>

    <p>Fleurette in quiet Ran­goon Road stands out and fits in at the same time.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant, which opened in Au­gust, looks stun­ning, from the curved wood pan­els to the tall dried grass and flo­ral as­sem­blage that draws the eye up the high ceil­ing.</p>
    <p>It is pol­ished. So­phis­ti­cated. Sexy, even. It says the peo­ple who run it are se­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>Chef Tariq Helou tells you he is 26. Your mind scrambles to do the maths. In the in­ter­view with The Sun­day Times, he says he was four when he de­cided he wanted to open a restau­rant.</p>
    <p>He has had 22 years to think about it.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean chef (“I did NS and ev­ery­thing”) has a Le­banese fa­ther and a Ja­panese-Chi­nese mother. He started cook­ing at age three – scram­bled eggs.</p>
    <p>“I did it with­out per­mis­sion,” he says, adding that his mother would sit him on the kitchen counter while she cooked and did chores, so she could keep an eye on him.</p>
    <p>He grew up watch­ing her cook, and would also hang out at his Ja­panese grand­mother’s home here, where he would do more cook­ing with her and with his aunt.</p>
    <p>“What­ever I wanted to do, they said okay,” he says. “One time, I wanted to make udon and we spent six hours on it, work­ing un­til mid­night.”</p>
    <p>He and co-owner Ai­dan Wee, also 26, have been friends since Pri­mary 5 at Henry Park Pri­mary. In their teens, Helou would go to Wee’s home af­ter school, rum­mage through the fridge and cook.</p>
    <p>Start­ing when they were 18, they would blow their NS pay on a ritzy meal in a restau­rant – Bac­cha­na­lia, Fat Cow, The Naked Finn, Restau­rant An­dre and Zen, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“We just wanted to learn and ab­sorb,” Helou says.</p>
    <p>He went on to culi­nary school in Switzer­land, and worked there, in France and in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, a restau­rant he had al­ways wanted to work in turned out to be un­der­whelm­ing. He de­cided it was time to open his own place.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Wee was at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity, ma­jor­ing in busi­ness and an­a­lyt­ics. He could not see him­self do­ing that for the rest of his life.</p>
    <p>When his friend asked him to open the restau­rant to­gether, he told his par­ents.</p>
    <p>“They said, ‘Grad­u­ate’,” says Wee. He did.</p>
    <p>They did not open the restau­rant right away, how­ever. When Helou came back to Sin­ga­pore, they ran a sup­per club twice a week.</p>
    <p>They put in $500 each to start the busi­ness, which went on for eight months, be­tween 2018 and 2019. That time helped them fig­ure out the me­chan­ics of run­ning a restau­rant.</p>
    <p>When the time came, they did not land an in­vestor. In­stead, they put to­gether the money from fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have to an­swer to 10 in­vestors,” Wee says.</p>
    <p>Helou chimes in: “We begged and bor­rowed. Th­ese are tiny in­vestors that we know. We are not at risk of peo­ple pulling out.”</p>
    <p>Asked how much it cost to set the restau­rant up, he is flum­moxed by this re­porter’s es­ti­mates. High six­fig­ures? Mid six-fig­ures?</p>
    <p>“Um. Not even.”</p>
    <p>It ap­par­ently cost low six-fig­ures. Reser­va­tions are hard to come by. The restau­rant has 10 counter seats and a semi-pri­vate room for five. A nine-course meal costs $218 and for now, it is din­ners only.</p>
    <p>Helou has a neat way to de­scribe his food.</p>
    <p>“It’s like a pie. The crust is French, the cream top­ping is Ja­panese and the filling is lo­cal.”</p>
    <p>The chilled somen with sweet, raw botan ebi at the bot­tom and amaebi oil float­ing on top of the dashi is meant to evoke prawn noo­dles. Mc­Don­ald’s is firmly en­trenched here, and the amadai sit­ting on house­made tar­tar sauce is an ode to the fish burger the chain serves.</p>
    <p>Start­ing this month, Helou and Wee are up­ping their game. They have more hands in the kitchen, free­ing up the chef to think up new things for the menu. There will be lit­tle snacks at the start of the meal. Petit fours. A take-home food gift.</p>
    <p>It all sounds like they are gun­ning for some­thing.</p>
    <p>“If they come, great,” Helou says of the Miche­lin Guide in­spec­tors. “If you want stars, there’s a beat you dance to. I will get the stars my way, not by fol­low­ing the tem­plate.”</p>
