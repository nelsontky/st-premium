    <p>In­surer Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore will hire up to 500 fi­nan­cial con­sul­tants next year, in­clud­ing around 200 mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als se­lected for a new tal­ent man­age­ment pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The re­cruit­ing drive comes amid grow­ing aware­ness of the im­por­tance of in­sur­ance, the firm said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Chief agency of­fi­cer John Soong noted: “As one of the largest in­sur­ers in Sin­ga­pore, we want to of­fer sup­port to both mid-ca­reer job seek­ers and young peo­ple who face lim­ited em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in this tough cli­mate.</p>
    <p>“We are also ex­pand­ing our agency force to meet ris­ing de­mand for med­i­cal and pro­tec­tion so­lu­tions, as the pan­demic has brought into sharp re­lief the im­por­tance of in­sur­ance.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany is in­vest­ing $1 mil­lion in the tal­ent man­age­ment pro­gramme, which starts in Jan­uary, to groom mid-ca­reer job seek­ers in fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory. The two-year train­ing pro­gramme will in­clude a year-long com­pe­tency and skills course that will cover ar­eas such as tech­ni­cal train­ing, prod­uct knowl­edge, lead­er­ship de­vel­op­ment, ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tions and so­cial me­dia con­tent cre­ation.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants will get a monthly al­lowance of up to $10,000 pegged to rel­e­vant work ex­pe­ri­ence for the two years.</p>
    <p>Mr Soong said: “For mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als, this is an op­por­tu­nity for them to rein­vent their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>“Our pro­gramme has been de­signed to help el­i­gi­ble can­di­dates fast-track their in­sur­ance ca­reers by equip­ping them with crit­i­cal tech­ni­cal and prac­ti­cal knowl­edge as well as the nec­es­sary soft skills. They will also ben­e­fit from men­tor­ing by a team of agency lead­ers.”</p>
    <p>Fresh grad­u­ates who join the firm as fi­nan­cial con­sul­tants will also un­dergo an in-house train­ing pro­gramme cov­er­ing top­ics such as fi­nan­cial plan­ning, plan con­struc­tion, fi­nan­cial needs anal­y­sis, in­vest­ment and re­tire­ment plan­ning.</p>
    <p>They will re­ceive a monthly tran­si­tion al­lowance for the first two years to help them kick-start their ca­reers in in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial has re­cently hired job seek­ers who switched from other in­dus­tries to be fi­nan­cial con­sul­tants.</p>
    <p>Ms Camelia Soh, 25, joined in June after be­ing a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines cabin crew mem­ber for five years.</p>
    <p>“I de­cided to be a fi­nan­cial con­sul</p>
    <p>tant as it gives me the job se­cu­rity that I’m look­ing for,” she said.</p>
    <p>“In the last few months, I’ve learnt so much about the in­sur­ance busi­ness from my men­tor and through the var­i­ous train­ing ses­sions. The knowl­edge and skills I gained are re­ally use­ful in build­ing my ca­reer, and I do see my­self in this job for a long time.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant Clare Mo, 43, joined in July when the travel agency she had worked at for more than 10 years was forced to down­size.</p>
    <p>She said: “After I was let go by my com­pany, I was at a loss. Should I wait for the tourism in­dus­try to re­cover, switch to teach­ing or join the civil ser­vice?</p>
    <p>“In the end, I chose to be a fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant as I could see it as a long-term ca­reer, and it is more aligned with my in­ter­est in help­ing peo­ple with their pro­tec­tion needs and re­tire­ment plan­ning. I also learnt to ap­pre­ci­ate the im­por­tance of fi­nan­cial plan­ning, es­pe­cially in times of cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>Mr Joseph Fu, 23, joined Pru­den­tial after he had to close his dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing agency due to the pan­demic. He said: “Be­ing a fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant is like be­ing my own boss again. I set my own goals and de­cide how to grow my busi­ness, while pick­ing up es­sen­tial skills that will help me suc­ceed in my long-term ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>For mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als, this is an op­por­tu­nity for them to rein­vent their ca­reers. Our pro­gramme has been de­signed to help el­i­gi­ble can­di­dates fast-track their in­sur­ance ca­reers by equip­ping them with crit­i­cal tech­ni­cal and prac­ti­cal knowl­edge as well as the nec­es­sary soft skills. They will also ben­e­fit from men­tor­ing by a team of agency lead­ers.</p>
