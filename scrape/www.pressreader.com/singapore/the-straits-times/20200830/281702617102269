    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land is fi­nal­is­ing a plan that would make it pos­si­ble for re­tired, sun-seek­ing Euro­peans to spend the up­com­ing win­ter months in the coun­try in an ef­fort to save its ail­ing tourism in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Asian na­tion’s bor­ders have been closed to most for­eign­ers since late March to fight the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the govern­ment is now plan­ning to grant visas to for­eign­ers who want to stay in Thai­land for up to nine months, said Mr Boon Vanasin, chair­man of Thon­buri Health­care Group, the na­tion’s third largest pri­vate hos­pi­tal firm, which runs hos­pi­tals and re­tire­ment homes.</p>
    <p>These long-term vis­i­tors will be­gin their stay with a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine and sev­eral virus tests i n the tourist hotspot of Phuket.</p>
    <p>Af­ter three weeks on the is­land and neg­a­tive test re­sults, they would be free to travel to other Thai re­gions, ac­cord­ing to Mr Boon, who said he has di­rect knowl­edge of the govern­ment’s plan and ex­pects the ar­rivals to be­gin be­fore win­ter.</p>
    <p>While the govern­ment has ap­proved the plan in prin­ci­ple, it is still fi­nal­is­ing mea­sures to re­duce the risk of virus in­fec­tions, said govern­ment spokesman Traisulee Traiso­ranakul.</p>
    <p>The open­ing-up is a life­line for Thai­land’s dev­as­tated tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try, which is strug­gling to sur­vive af­ter five months with­out for­eign vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Al­though Thai­land has been one of the world’s most suc­cess­ful coun­tries in curb­ing Covid-19 – it has not had a lo­cally trans­mit­ted case for three months – its tourism­re­liant econ­omy has been one of the worst-hit glob­ally, pro­jected to shrink by a record of 8.5 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s new plan will make it pos­si­ble for mil­lions of se­niors from European coun­tries like Ger­many and Swe­den, who usu­ally spend their win­ter months in warmer Mediter­ranean coun­tries, to con­sider the Asian na­tion in­stead as it is safe from in­fec­tion risk, said Mr Boon.</p>
    <p>Num­ber of Euro­peans who vis­ited Thai­land last year. They made up about 17 per cent of to­tal for­eign vis­i­tors and 24 per cent of to­tal for­eign spend­ing.</p>
    <p>He said his com­pany has fielded queries from European re­tire­ment com­mu­ni­ties that could amount to 50,000 se­niors mak­ing the jour­ney to Thai­land for the com­ing win­ter.</p>
    <p>He plans to part­ner ho­tels to pro­vide quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties and longterm ac­com­mo­da­tion for se­nior cit­i­zens and other long-stay vis­i­tors, who could ar­rive via char­tered flights be­fore win­ter be­gins.</p>
