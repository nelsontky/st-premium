        SCIENCE B9 THE STRAITS TIMES SATURDAY, AUGUST 29, 2020 | | | DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK Facts and figures FLORA AND FAUNA DID YOU KNOW Establishe­d Annual rainfall Not too long ago... Species of plants Native wildlife species October 1994 <50mm Wildflower­s In 2016, parts of Death
Valley erupted with a rare ‘superbloom’ not seen since 2005. Its occurrence is triggered by rainfall brought about by El Nino conditions. (Singapore rcorded 1,368mm of rainfall last year) Visitorshi­p in 2019 Wildflower­s bloom in winter and spring each year. Here are some of them. 1.74 million Temperatur­e range Size >49 deg C The largest national park in the continenta­l US at From in the desert to >12,000 sq km below freezing in the mountains (More than 16 times the land area of Singapore) Desert Five-spot Rock Mimulus Badwater Basin in Death Valley, at 855m below sea level, is the in the Western Hemisphere Scenes in movie franchise Star Wars, such as those featuring desert planet Tatooine in A New Hope, and R2-D2 and C-3P0’s journey to Jabba’s Palace in Return Of The Jedi, were filmed in Death Valley’s Golden Canyon, Dante’s View and Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes. Park boundary Desert Gold Mojave pineapple cactus Fremont Phacelia Greater roadrunner (Geococcyx california­nus) Furnace Creek • Featured in folklore and cartoons Eats lizards, insects, small birds and snakes It is heat-tolerant as it has a naturally high body temperatur­e of 40 deg C
A long-legged ground-dweller that can reach a top speed of 30kmh Enigmatic ‘sailing’ stones Racetrack Playa Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes • Devil’s Hole (an off-site extension of Death Valley National Park Panamint Range Golden Canyon Badwater Dante’s View Amargosa Range • Rocks – some weighing over 300kg – appear to move across a dried lake bed known as Racetrack Playa on their own, leaving trails behind them in the cracked mud.
In 2013, for the first time, scientists filmed the movement of the stones using time-lapse photograph­y. Below is the explanatio­n of the rare phenomenon. Black-tailed jackrabbit Devil’s Hole pupfish Blood vessels in the ears act like a car radiator to dissipate heat (Cyprinodon diabolis) • (Lepus californic­us) • Found near valley floor and in mountains
Named for its ears, which resemble those of a jackass, or donkey
Baby hares are mobile within minutes of birth
Feeds on water-rich vegetation to replenish the water it needs
Top speed:
64kmh Why is Death Valley so hot? Sacramento San Francisco • 1 shallow pond Rain creates a in the playa which freezes over during cold winter nights Nevada Its geographic­al features – a lower-than-sea-level basin and surroundin­g mountains Las Vegas California – create a ‘pocket’ which traps and circulates superheate­d air, making it the driest and hottest spot in North America 2 • On sunny days, the ice melts and breaks up to form Los Angeles large rafts of thin ice floats Arizona • Area enlarged 3 4 Light wind Stones are pushed forward pushes the ice floats against the stones • Hotly contested records 1st Death Valley, California • It is one of five pupfish species found in the park and is critically endangered
Up to 3cm long and lives for slightly more than a year
Its numbers plunged to only 35 in 2013
Its final holdout is a water-filled limestone cavern in the Nevadan desert dating to the last Ice Age July 10, 1913 5 Stones leave trail imprints in the 2nd soft mud Kebili, Tunisia • July 7, 1931 S’porean runner who conquered Death Valley • 3rd & 4th Mitribah, Kuwait Turbat, Pakistan • July 21, 2016 May 28, 2017 60-year-old Lim Nghee Huat took the 58th spot out of 96 competitor­s in an ultramarat­hon at Death Valley in July 2013. He completed the 217km footrace in 42 hours and 34 minutes and helped raise $130,000 for a charity. The World Meteorolog­ical Organisati­on will verify the temperatur­e of 54.4 deg C in Death Valley. This could take months or even years.
The high temperatur­e comes amid an extensive heatwave on the west coast of the US that is due to a persistent heat dome which occurs when the atmosphere traps hot ocean air like a lid. Climate change is fuelling the frequency, duration and intensity of such high-pressure domes. • Temperatur­e-measuring equipment at Furnace Creek Sources: NATIONAL PARK SERVICE (NPS), NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERI­C ADMINISTRA­TION (NOAA) PHOTOS: NPS, NOAA, ISTOCK, ST FILE STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS: LIM YONG PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
