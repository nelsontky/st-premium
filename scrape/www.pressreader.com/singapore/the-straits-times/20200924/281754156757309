    <p>Fun seek­ers head­ing to the beaches in Sen­tosa will now have to make book­ings ahead of their visit, to bet­ter fa­cil­i­tate Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>From Oct 17, peo­ple who want to visit the beaches dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods, in­clud­ing week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days, will have to make reser­va­tions first.</p>
    <p>The book­ing sys­tem will be tri­alled for an ini­tial pe­riod of three months for Tan­jong, Palawan and Siloso beaches, said Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It added that crowds have been ob­served at these sites dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment comes af­ter the Government said in July that pop­u­lar pub­lic spa­ces such as parks and beaches will be tem­po­rar­ily closed off as they ap­proach ca­pac­ity lim­its, to man­age crowds there.</p>
    <p>Carparks serv­ing those ar­eas may also be se­lec­tively closed, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said at the time.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures are still in place. MOH had also noted then that crowds were ob­served at se­lected parts of the beach at East Coast Park, with many in groups of more than five in­di­vid­u­als and with­out proper safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The National Parks Board said more pop­u­lar beach­fronts at East Coast Park have been seg­mented since early July and se­lected sec­tions that get too crowded are tem­po­rar­ily closed.</p>
    <p>For the lat­est Sen­tosa beach book­ings, guests may pre-book their en­try at the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity web­site up to seven days be­fore their beach visit, sub­ject to ca­pac­ity lim­its.</p>
    <p>The reser­va­tion sys­tem will ac­cept book­ings from Oct 10, for vis­its start­ing from Oct 17.</p>
    <p>Guests may choose from two time slots to visit – in the morning (8am to 1pm) or af­ter­noon (2pm to 7pm).</p>
    <p>They may make reser­va­tions for up to five peo­ple in each book­ing and will re­ceive an e-mail con­firm­ing their se­lected beach zone and time slot.</p>
    <p>On the day of the visit, guests should ap­proach the beach en­try kiosk of their se­lected zone, and present their con­fir­ma­tion e-mail for ver­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>They will be is­sued wrist­bands for ad­mis­sion and may ac­cess the se­lected beach zone at any point dur­ing the re­served time slot.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen beach courts across Tan­jong, Palawan and Siloso beaches will also be made avail­able for book­ing, for court-based games such as beach vol­ley­ball.</p>
    <p>Since July, the three beaches have been seg­mented into a to­tal of seven zones, each with a ca­pac­ity limit rang­ing be­tween 100 and 350 peo­ple to al­low for safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>“Safety rings” have also been pro­gres­sively put in place on Sen­tosa’s beaches dur­ing the same pe­riod, in­di­cat­ing spots where groups of up to five peo­ple may gather.</p>
    <p>Groups should keep within the de­mar­cated area and ob­serve a min­i­mum safe dis­tance of 1m from other groups and guests.</p>
    <p>Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Thien Kwee Eng said: “The launch of a reser­va­tion-only beach en­try dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods will help us en­sure that Sen­tosa re­mains safe for all guests and staff as we wel­come more guests back to our di­verse and ex­cit­ing ar­ray of leisure of­fer­ings.”</p>
    <p>En­gi­neer Car­rie Mok, 25, said hav­ing to make a Sen­tosa beach book­ing prior to a visit is slightly in­con­ve­nient, as it re­quires ex­tra plan­ning.</p>
    <p>“I won’t be able to take im­promptu strolls along the beach af­ter din­ner at VivoCity over the week­ends,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But con­sid­er­ing how crowded Sen­tosa beaches have been, I think this mea­sure is a good safe­guard against the spread of the virus.”</p>
