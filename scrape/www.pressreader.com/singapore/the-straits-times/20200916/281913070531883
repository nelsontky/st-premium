    <p>COPEN­HAGEN • A mas­sive chunk of ice – larger than the city of Paris, or about one-sixth the size of Sin­ga­pore – has bro­ken off from the Arc­tic’s largest ice shelf be­cause of warmer tem­per­a­tures in Green­land, sci­en­tists said.</p>
    <p>The 113 sq km block broke off from the Nioghalvf­jerds­fjor­den glacier in north-east Green­land, which the sci­en­tists said had been ex­pected, given the ris­ing av­er­age tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>“We’re ob­serv­ing in­creas­ing speed on this largest re­main­ing ice shelf,” glaciol­ogy pro­fes­sor Ja­son Box from the Ge­o­log­i­cal Sur­vey of Den­mark and Green­land (Geus) told Agence France-Presse on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Geus pub­lished satel­lite images show­ing the por­tions of the glacier that had bro­ken off.</p>
    <p>While it is nor­mal for pieces of ice to break off from a glacier – a process called calv­ing – they are gen­er­ally not this large.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Geus, since 1999, the glacier has lost 160 sq km of ice, with the loss rate ac­cel­er­at­ing in the past two years.</p>
    <p>“If we see more warm sum­mers like we ob­served in the last two years, it will be contributi­ng more to the ac­cel­er­at­ing global sea level rise,” Pro­fes­sor Box said.</p>
    <p>The melting of Green­land’s ice sheet con­trib­uted to a sea level rise of 1.1cm be­tween 1992 and 2018, ac­cord­ing to a study pub­lished in sci­ence jour­nal Na­ture last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>A more re­cent study by the Univer­sity of Lin­coln in Eng­land pre­dicted that the melting ice in Green­land could raise sea lev­els by 10cm to 12cm by 2100.</p>
    <p>Av­er­age tem­per­a­tures in the re­gion have risen by about 3 deg C since 1980 and are ex­pected to reach record lev­els this year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ms Jenny Tur­ton, a re­searcher at Ger­many’s Friedrich-Alexan­der Univer­si­tat Er­lan­gen-Nurn­berg, heat­waves in re­cent years have ac­cel­er­ated the melting.</p>
    <p>“Each sum­mer, water drains from the Green­land ice sheet onto the tongue of the glacier, form­ing rivers and ponds on the sur­face. Re­freez­ing of the water in win­ter cre­ates ad­di­tional pres­sure on the float­ing tongue, which can lead to calv­ing events,” Ms Turston said in a state­ment pub­lished by Geus.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers said the de­vel­op­ment mir­rored that of a neigh­bour­ing glacier, the Zachariae, which col­lapsed into the ocean in 2015, lead­ing to an in­crease in calv­ing as it was heated from both the ocean and air.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Float&#xAD;ing ice in the Arc&#xAD;tic Ocean this week. While it is nor&#xAD;mal for pieces of ice to break off from a glacier, they are gen&#xAD;er&#xAD;ally not as large as the chunk &#x2013; es&#xAD;ti&#xAD;mated to be about one-sixth the size of Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore &#x2013; that split from the glacier in north-east Green&#xAD;land.</p>
