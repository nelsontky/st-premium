    <p>With just one day to go, the most im­por­tant pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in the United States’ mod­ern his­tory is down to the wire.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple in­di­ca­tors cer­tainly point to a Joe Bi­den vic­tory – per­haps more than they did for Hil­lary Clin­ton in 2016. But while Mr Bi­den has a bet­ter lead than what Mrs Clin­ton had four years ago in most states, a cou­ple of lat­est polls show him slip­ping.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Mrs Clin­ton won the pop­u­lar vote, but Mr Trump won the White House – by win­ning a small hand­ful of states by fewer than 100,000 votes.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s 2016 vic­tory was only the fifth time in 192 years that a can­di­date won the pres­i­dency de­spite los­ing the pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>No savvy strate­gist who went through 2016 will dis­count the pos­si­bil­ity, even if the num­bers sug­gest oth­er­wise – and they do.</p>
    <p>The key is the Elec­toral Col­lege, a unique fea­ture of the US elec­toral sys­tem, which gives smaller states a big­ger im­pact on pres­i­den­tial elec­tions than they would oth­er­wise have on the strength of their vot­ers alone.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers are ul­ti­mately vot­ing for pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent, but they are ac­tu­ally vot­ing for their states’ elec­tors who are set to meet on Dec 14. The elec­tors are sup­posed to vote faith­fully, ac­cord­ing to the elec­tion re­sult in their state.</p>
    <p>On Oct 28, Ms Amy Wal­ter, na­tional po­lit­i­cal edi­tor of the</p>
    <p>Cook Po­lit­i­cal Re­port, wrote: “In 2016, he (Mr Trump) won 30 states (and Maine’s 2nd Con­gres­sional District) and their 306 elec­toral votes. To­day, just 20 states, worth 125 elec­toral votes, are safely in his col­umn. For­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den is hold­ing 24 states worth 290 elec­toral votes in his col­umn.”</p>
    <p>A can­di­date must get 270 to win the Elec­toral Col­lege. The num­bers seem in Mr Bi­den’s favour; while Pres­i­dent Trump has a nar­row path to 270, Mr Bi­den is look­ing at sev­eral dif­fer­ent ways to 270.</p>
    <p>To win, Mr Trump will need to win ev­ery state in the “toss up” col­umn: Florida, Ge­or­gia, North Carolina, Iowa, Ohio, Texas and Maine’s 2nd Con­gres­sional District.</p>
    <p>“Even then, Mr Trump would be 22 elec­toral votes short of 270,” Ms Wal­ter wrote. He would have to win at least two of seven states that “lean Demo­cratic” – Ari­zona, Michi­gan, Min­nesota, Wis­con­sin, Penn­syl­va­nia, Ne­vada and New Hamp­shire – to get over 270.</p>
    <p>He did win all of those but Min­nesota, Ne­vada and New Hamp­shire in 2016.</p>
    <p>In some states, Mr Bi­den’s lead is not very wide. Even a small 2 to 3 point polling er­ror or sam­pling flaw skew­ing the num­bers could make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>As of last Fri­day evening, the Real Clear Pol­i­tics av­er­age of polls had Mr Bi­den ahead of Mr Trump by 3.6 points in Penn­syl­va­nia, 6.5 in Michi­gan, and 6.4 in Wis­con­sin – but just 3.2 in Florida and 1.2 in North Carolina. Ari­zona was a tie.</p>
    <p>Since then, new polls show Mr</p>
    <p>Bi­den has slipped be­hind Pres­i­dent Trump in Florida, Iowa and Utah. A Des Moines Regis­ter poll has Mr Trump ahead by as many as seven points in Iowa.</p>
    <p>Democrats are ner­vous about Penn­syl­va­nia as well.</p>
    <p>“While there is a greater en­thu­si­asm for Mr Trump, there is also a very large an­tipa­thy to Mr Trump, peo­ple who re­ally hate him,” Pro­fes­sor Charles Zelden, from the Depart­ment of His­tory and Po­lit­i­cal Science at Nova South­east­ern Univer­sity in Florida, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“A lot of the vote for Mr Bi­den isn’t a vote for Mr Bi­den, but a vote against Mr Trump. But it is very close and it comes down to the in­de­pen­dents; do they break to Mr Trump or to Mr Bi­den?” Prof Zelden said.</p>
    <p>“At this point, what the polls are show­ing us is Mr Bi­den’s got the bet­ter chance. In Mr Trump’s case, he needs to do bet­ter than Mr Bi­den. Mr Trump has a very rea­son­able chance to win, if ev­ery­thing goes his way. Whereas Mr Bi­den, all else be­ing equal, needs things to go a lit­tle bit his way and he’ll get the win.</p>
    <p>“I’d rather be Mr Bi­den than Mr Trump in this sit­u­a­tion, but don’t count Mr Trump out.”</p>
