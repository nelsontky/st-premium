    <p>“Can I use the $80,000 to buy my own art­work?” Vin­cent Leow asks.</p>
    <p>The 59-year-old con­tem­po­rary artist is mus­ing about what he can do with the Cul­tural Medal­lion grant, which is avail­able for re­cip­i­ents of the coun­try’s premier arts honour.</p>
    <p>“Artists need con­sumers. That’s the best way to sup­port artists. Maybe I give you $50,000 to buy my works and you can buy only my works, like the travel vouch­ers,” he adds mis­chie­vously.</p>
    <p>“I need to write a su­per pro­posal to con­vince the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil to give me the money. Then I turn it into vouch­ers to buy my art.”</p>
    <p>This puck­ish ap­proach is typ­i­cal of Leow, an early mem­ber of The Artist Vil­lage, the famed hub of con­tem­po­rary art-mak­ing in Sin­ga­pore in the 1980s founded by Tang Da Wu.</p>
    <p>Leow once made an en­tire out­fit – in­clud­ing match­ing hat and shoes – out of fake Amer­i­can dol­lars, which is now in the Na­tional Col­lec­tion. He wore it as part of a 1992 per­for­mance piece in which he cri­tiqued so­ci­ety’s ma­te­ri­al­ism.</p>
    <p>The former en­fant ter­ri­ble – “I don’t know why they gave me that name,” he de­clares – has grown up, it seems.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the Cul­tural Medal­lion, pre­sented by the Pres­i­dent of the Repub­lic, is the high­est ac­co­lade an artist can earn in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He says the prize is an un­ex­pected honour: “It’s a kind of recog­ni­tion, that maybe what I’m do­ing is ac­cepted. I never re­ally thought I would re­ceive it. It’s nice to have it.”</p>
    <p>But a con­ver­sa­tion with the artist un­earths hints of, if not a lin­ger­ing dis­com­fort, then a thought­ful dia­logue with the “Es­tab­lish­ment”.</p>
    <p>He may hold a doc­tor­ate in fine art from Mel­bourne’s RMIT Univer­sity and teach at the School of the Arts, but he ques­tions the whole idea of an art school.</p>
    <p>He says ru­mi­na­tively about teach­ing, which in­cluded a six-year stint in the United Arab Emi­rates’ Univer­sity of Shar­jah: “Art is much more than what we are taught in schools. Schools have rubrics to as­sess. So some­times I do feel that when we teach, we can­not say, ‘This is very tra­di­tional, very for­mal.’ In the real world, you look at art so dif­fer­ently.”</p>
    <p>He likes art which pro­vokes and “trig­gers” him to “think fur­ther about why we make art”.</p>
    <p>“I try to cre­ate prob­lems in my own art-mak­ing be­cause I feel it makes me think. I don’t want to make it easy. I’m al­ways in­ter­ested in the idea and what is the suit­able medium or art form. There’s al­ways ex­per­i­men­ta­tion in my process, which I en­joy.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, provo­ca­tion and con­tro­versy is a type of dia­logue, as he ob­serves when the sub­ject of a mi­nor furore over one of his old sketches, dis­played at the Es­planade two years ago, comes up.</p>
    <p>The 1989 sketch of a nude fig­ure and a chicken was re­moved af­ter the con­ser­va­tive group Sin­ga­pore­ans De­fend­ing Mar­riage and Fam­ily ac­cused the Es­planade of “pro­mot­ing bes­tial­ity”.</p>
    <p>Leow says: “It’s al­ways about how we want our art to im­pact view­ers. If the art doesn’t do any­thing, then why bother to do art in the first place?”</p>
    <p>So­cial re­stric­tions can be a creative spur. The fa­ther of two daugh­ters, aged 17 and 14, and a son, 12, re­calls: “I was hav­ing a con­ver­sa­tion in Ber­lin with some artists about how re­stric­tive Sin­ga­pore is.</p>
    <p>“These artists were talk­ing about how free they are, but it comes to a point when they don’t know what is free­dom, what’s free any­more. Be­cause they feel that they can do any­thing, all of a sud­den, they can­not do any­thing.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, where there are so many OB (out-of­bound) mark­ers, all of a sud­den, they be­come things for you to think about – why is it there?”</p>
    <p>But the kam­pung boy, who moved into a Hous­ing Board flat with his fam­ily only when he was 18 and re­mem­bers grow­ing up with­out elec­tric­ity, still feels rooted to this lit­tle red dot, which is about as old as he is.</p>
    <p>“I feel like I’m a lit­tle bit like what this coun­try is about – a bit of kam­pung, a bit of city. Ul­ti­mately, the work I want to do is about the place I’m born in.”</p>
