    <p>Bri­tish fash­ion brands Top­shop and Top­man will close their last out­let in Sin­ga­pore next Thurs­day and go on­line in­stead, with re­tail ex­perts say­ing more brands might fol­low suit.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Wing Tai Re­tail, brand man­ager for Top­shop and Top­man here, con­firmed the clo­sure of the VivoCity out­let, and said its fo­cus for the two brands will be on­line.</p>
    <p>Top­shop and Top­man have been in Sin­ga­pore for two decades, with the first store open­ing at Wisma Atria in Or­chard Road in 2000.</p>
    <p>A Wing Tai Re­tail spokesman said the lease of the brands’ shop at VivoCity has ended and that Wing Tai will be fo­cus­ing on its om­nichan­nel re­tail strat­egy – which in­volves both phys­i­cal and on­line sales chan­nels – to bet­ter meet chang­ing con­sumer pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Top­shop and Top­man, Wing Tai Re­tail also man­ages brands such as Adi­das, G2000, Dorothy Perkins and Uniqlo in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said the clo­sure is part of Wing Tai’s busi­ness re­view of its brands port­fo­lio to fine-tune its dis­tri­bu­tion strat­egy, adding that both brands con­tinue to be pop­u­lar in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral sale signs were seen at Top­shop’s and Top­man’s VivoCity out­let yes­ter­day, with a buy-two-get-one-free deal avail­able for a “lim­ited time only”.</p>
    <p>The de­par­ture of Top­shop and Top­man is “a symp­tom of the larger malaise that has af­flicted many for­mats in the bricks and mor­tar re­tail in­dus­try”, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Se­shan Ra­maswami of Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, who spe­cialises in mar­ket­ing ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>He noted that this cov­ers de­part­ment stores, cloth­ing stores, toy stores, book­stores and malls.</p>
    <p>“The ex­piry of the lease is likely just the cat­a­lyst,” he said, adding that with the like­li­hood of ex­tremely slow growth for the fore­see­able fu­ture due to the Covid-19 pandemic, com­mit­ting to a lease re­newal is prob­a­bly not easy to jus­tify.</p>
    <p>He warned that other brands might sim­i­larly do away with a phys­i­cal pres­ence and fo­cus on on­line sales.</p>
    <p>“That strong brands like Top­shop and Top­man with a fairly big fol­low­ing in Sin­ga­pore would move on­line is a lead­ing in­di­ca­tor of the for­tunes of other store brands which may have a weaker fran­chise,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Es­ther Ho, direc­tor of Nanyang Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness Man­age­ment, said brands with only one or two out­lets would not ben­e­fit from economies of scale, and that mov­ing on­line might help to cut the strain on re­sources amid the pandemic.</p>
    <p>“The foot­fall in malls has taken a hit, so it is timely for busi­nesses to try scal­ing up their on­line sales, with­out con­cur­rently suf­fer­ing a drain on their re­sources in phys­i­cal stores,” she said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she did not rule out the re­turn of phys­i­cal Top­shop and Top­man out­lets post-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“There is a sense that hav­ing a dual pres­ence helps to of­fer some vis­i­bil­ity in the mar­ket,” she said.</p>
    <p>Prof Ra­maswami said Top­shop and Top­man are likely to re­main pop­u­lar here. “That the brands are go­ing to con­tinue to be sold on­line does in­di­cate that they are still per­ceived to have a size­able au­di­ence in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>In July, it was re­ported that Top­shop was clos­ing its last store in Hong Kong, a 14,000 sq ft, two­s­torey store in Cen­tral.</p>
    <p>Like the brand’s move in Sin­ga­pore, Top­shop prod­ucts will con­tinue to be avail­able on­line for cus­tomers in the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>At per­fume ate­lier Mai­son 21G, shop­pers can smell, al­beit through their masks, var­i­ous scents such as jas­mine and berg­amot, and try their hand at blend­ing them.</p>
    <p>The one-year-old Sin­ga­pore­based brand opened a new 753 sq ft bou­tique at Ion Or­chard last month.</p>
    <p>It also has a flag­ship unit in Dux­ton Road and a counter at BHG Bugis Junc­tion de­part­ment store.</p>
    <p>It is among at least five brands that are go­ing against the grain by grow­ing their bricks and mor­tar pres­ence, even as the re­tail sec­tor faces a pandemic-in­duced slump and more busi­nesses have has­tened to dig­i­talise. What they seem to be count­ing on is peo­ple’s need for a tan­gi­ble ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one can shop on­line, but when you go out, you want some­thing spe­cial and to en­joy hu­man con­nec­tion,” said Mai­son 21G founder Johanna Mo­nange, 45.</p>
    <p>The French­woman, who has been in Sin­ga­pore since 2014, said it cost $50,000 to set up the Ion Or­chard bou­tique store. By keep­ing most of the in­te­rior de­sign from the pre­vi­ous ten­ant, chang­ing only the fur­ni­ture and colour scheme and build­ing a scent bar, the com­pany saved $200,000 in ren­o­va­tion costs.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Har­vey Nor­man will soon add three new stores to its cur­rent slate of 12.</p>
    <p>It will launch its 9,100 sq ft Sele­tar Mall branch next Tues­day. Its 32,000 sq ft Su­per­store at The Cen­tre­point opens on Sept 22, with four de­part­ments – elec­tri­cal, com­put­ers, fur­ni­ture and bedding. It will also launch a 16,000 sq ft store at West­gate at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>“Phys­i­cal and on­line stores must co­ex­ist,” said Mr Ken­neth Arul­doss, 59, man­ag­ing direc­tor of Har­vey Nor­man Asia.</p>
    <p>He asked: “Would you buy a fridge with­out open­ing it or a bed with­out feel­ing it?”</p>
    <p>He added that the pandemic has fu­elled de­mand for such prod­ucts as more peo­ple work from home.</p>
    <p>Home-grown fash­ion la­bel Love, Bonito launched its fourth store on Sept 4. The 4,300 sq ft out­let in VivoCity aims to be fam­ily-friendly, with spa­ces for women and chil­dren to shop to­gether, and fit­ting rooms that ac­com­mo­date prams.</p>
    <p>Co-founder Rachel Lim, 33, said the busi­ness is tak­ing a long-term view on re­tail. “The Covid sit­u­a­tion is un­for­tu­nate but it will pass.</p>
    <p>“VivoCity has al­ways been a mall we’ve wanted to be present in be­cause of the sheer at­trac­tive­ness of its lo­ca­tion and its high per­cent­age of tourists (once travel picks up).”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, restau­rant and nightlife com­pany SJS Group opened Ital­ian bistro and cock­tail con­cept Bar Mi­lano in Keong Saik Road on July 8. SJS co-founder Sarissa Ro­driguez-Schwartz, 34, said: “We’ve all heard the view that peo­ple are not go­ing to dine out and that the restau­rant in­dus­try is dy­ing. But I’ve al­ways be­lieved that peo­ple ab­so­lutely still need to gather and share a meal.”</p>
    <p>Sports re­tail gi­ant De­cathlon’s fifth ex­pe­ri­ence store, which opens at The Cen­tre­point to­day, boasts a vir­tual re­al­ity show­room where cus­tomers can ex­pe­ri­ence tents in var­i­ous weather con­di­tions, and a 3D foot scan­ner that helps cus­tomers find their best-fit­ting shoes.</p>
    <p>De­cathlon Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing direc­tor Nils Swolkien, 42, said the chain trans­formed “very quickly into an omni-chan­nel plat­form” dur­ing the pandemic.</p>
    <p>Omni-chan­nel re­tail in­te­grates var­i­ous meth­ods of shop­ping, al­low­ing cus­tomers to or­der on­line but pick up in-store, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>“Each of our ex­pe­ri­ence stores is also an e-com­merce ful­fil­ment cen­tre to serve cus­tomers who live nearby but pre­fer to buy from home,” Mr Swolkien added.</p>
    <p>Re­tail ex­perts said some busi­nesses are seiz­ing the op­por­tu­nity in the Covid-19 cri­sis to en­ter or ex­pand in the mar­ket, as other play­ers leave.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ang Swee Hoon from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School said: “They might see this as op­por­tu­nity to fill gaps pre­vi­ously oc­cu­pied by com­peti­tors, es­pe­cially for busi­nesses which have, over the years, ac­cu­mu­lated a war chest of cash.”</p>
    <p>Mr Amos Tan, a se­nior lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness, noted that malls are now lur­ing re­tail­ers with more at­trac­tive terms, such as lower rent and shorter obli­ga­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>How­ever, re­tail­ers have to keep up with ex­pec­ta­tions, he cau­tioned. “When a con­sumer walks in, they don’t sim­ply want to buy. They are ex­pect­ing you to pro­vide an ex­pe­ri­ence that ac­ti­vates the he­do­nis­tic side of them.”</p>
