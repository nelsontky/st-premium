    <p>The shared bike pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore will be ex­pand­ing, af­ter lo­cal bi­cy­cle-shar­ing firm Any­wheel re­ceived ap­proval from the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) to ex­pand its fleet from 10,000 to 15,000 with ef­fect from this month.</p>
    <p>LTA also an­nounced last Wed­nes­day that its lat­est bike-shar­ing li­cence ap­pli­ca­tion cy­cle has opened.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that want to start of­fer­ing such ser­vices and ex­ist­ing op­er­a­tors which want to ex­pand their fleets have up till Aug 26 to sub­mit their ap­pli­ca­tions via LTA’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Li­cence ap­pli­ca­tions are open ev­ery Jan­uary and July. New firms can ap­ply for a sand­box li­cence to start bike-shar­ing op­er­a­tions on a small scale.</p>
    <p>This al­lows them to op­er­ate up to 1,000 bi­cy­cles in Sin­ga­pore while LTA as­sesses their op­er­a­tions, be­fore they can ap­ply to in­crease their fleet sizes.</p>
    <p>While Any­wheel now has a max­i­mum ap­proved fleet size of 15,000, lo­cal start-up SG Bike is the largest op­er­a­tor, with a li­cence to op­er­ate 25,000 bikes.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber l ast year, SG Bike com­pleted its takeover of Chi­nese firm Mo­bike’s li­cence to op­er­ate 25,000 bi­cy­cles in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, SG Bike held a li­cence to op­er­ate 3,000 bikes, which it had to give up once it took over Mo­bike’s li­cence. Firms are not al­lowed to hold two li­cences con­cur­rently.</p>
    <p>In early 2018, shared bi­cy­cles were ubiq­ui­tous, with seven com­pa­nies – Any­wheel, GBikes, Mo­bike, oBike, ofo, Share Bike SG and SG Bike – of­fer­ing about 200,000 dock­less shared bi­cy­cles in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>How­ever, mis­use of shared bikes sur­faced, with some re­port­edly chained out­side flats, and oth­ers aban­doned in canals and bins or van­dalised.</p>
    <p>More sig­nif­i­cantly, op­er­a­tors strug­gled to meet LTA’s new li­cens­ing reg­u­la­tions that were aimed at tack­ling in­dis­crim­i­nate park­ing and con­trol­ling fleet sizes.</p>
    <p>oBike, GBikes and Share Bike SG shut down their op­er­a­tions in 2018 while ofo’s li­cence was can­celled by LTA last year.</p>
