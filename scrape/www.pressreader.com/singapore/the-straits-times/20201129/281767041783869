    <p>Sit­ting in front of you is a Chief Ex­ec­u­tive of the Hong Kong SAR (Spe­cial</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­gion) who has no bank­ing ser­vice made avail­able to her... I have piles of cash at home, the govern­ment is pay­ing me cash for my salary.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong leader Car­rie Lam said she has “piles of cash” at home as she has no bank ac­count after the United States slapped sanc­tions on her in re­sponse to a dra­co­nian se­cu­rity law China im­posed on the city.</p>
    <p>She was tar­geted, along with 14 other se­nior city of­fi­cials, in the tough­est US ac­tion on Hong Kong since Bei­jing im­posed the new law on the ter­ri­tory in late June.</p>
    <p>The move by Wash­ing­ton freezes the Amer­i­can as­sets of the 15 of­fi­cials and crim­i­nalises any fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions in the US.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with lo­cal English TV chan­nel HKIBC aired on Fri­day night, Mrs Lam said she was “us­ing cash every day for all the things” after be­ing sanc­tioned.</p>
    <p>“Sit­ting in front of you is a Chief Ex­ec­u­tive of the Hong Kong SAR (Spe­cial Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­gion) who has no bank­ing ser­vice made avail­able to her,” Mrs Lam told HKIBC. “I have piles of cash at home, the govern­ment is pay­ing me cash for my salary,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam added that it was “very hon­ourable” to be “un­jus­ti­fi­ably sanc­tioned” by the US govern­ment and does not want to de­ter any­one from serv­ing in public of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam, who earns HK$5.21 mil­lion (S$898,000) a year, is one of the high­est-paid lead­ers in the world.</p>
    <p>Her re­marks sparked public back­lash, with so­cial me­dia users post­ing pho­tos of coins in their piggy banks at home to con­trast against Mrs Lam’s wealth.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers ques­tioned how her large salary would be trans­ported to her res­i­dence in cash.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam had told the me­dia in Au­gust that she faced “a lit­tle bit of in­con­ve­nience” from the sanc­tions which ham­pered her use of credit cards.</p>
