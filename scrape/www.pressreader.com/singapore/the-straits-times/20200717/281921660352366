    <p>THE HAGUE • The United Na­tions’ high­est court for dis­putes be­tween coun­tries sided with Qatar on Tues­day in its le­gal fight with sev­eral Gulf states that im­posed an air block­ade against Doha.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia, the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt sev­ered po­lit­i­cal, trade and trans­port ties with Qatar in June 2017, ac­cus­ing Doha of back­ing Is­lamist rad­i­cals and Iran.</p>
    <p>Doha de­nies the charges and says the em­bargo aims to un­der­mine its sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has strong ties with all the states in­volved, in­clud­ing Qatar, which hosts the l argest Amer­i­can mil­i­tary base in the re­gion, and sees the rift as a threat to ef­forts to con­tain Iran. It has pushed for a united Gulf front.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice’s 16-judge panel ruled that appeals filed by Qatar’s neigh­bours against sev­eral de­ci­sions of the In­ter­na­tional Civil Avi­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Icao) should be dis­missed.</p>
    <p>The court also con­firmed that it was the Icao that has ju­ris­dic­tion in the airspace row.</p>
    <p>Doha ob­jected to the clos­ing of the airspace in a com­plaint to the Icao, and that case con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>Qatar has lim­ited airspace and has had to rely on that of Iran.</p>
    <p>In a re­ac­tion to Tues­day’s rul­ing, Qatar said it wel­comed the de­ci­sion “that it has the right to chal­lenge airspace re­stric­tions im­posed by Saudi Ara­bia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt be­fore the UN’s avi­a­tion body”.</p>
    <p>The UAE is­sued a state­ment vow­ing to fight on at the Icao, say­ing it “will now put its le­gal case to Icao sup­port­ing the right to close its airspace to Qatari air­craft”.</p>
    <p>Diplo­mats and Gulf sources have told Reuters that the United States has been try­ing to con­vince Saudi Ara­bia and its al­lies to re­open their airspace to Qatar, but that me­di­a­tion ef­forts since the start of this year have so far been un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>The UN avi­a­tion agency, which is head­quar­tered i n Mon­treal, does not im­pose bind­ing rules, but wields clout through safety and se­cu­rity stan­dards that are usu­ally fol­lowed by its 193 mem­ber-coun­tries.</p>
    <p>There is also a dis­pute res­o­lu­tion mech­a­nism un­der the 1944 Chicago Con­ven­tion which is over­seen by Icao.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia, the United Arab Emi­rates, Bahrain and Egypt sev­ered po­lit­i­cal, trade and trans­port ties with Qatar in June 2017, ac­cus­ing Doha of back­ing Is­lamist rad­i­cals and Iran.</p>
    <p>Doha de­nies the charges and says the em­bargo aims to un­der­mine its sovereignt­y.</p>
