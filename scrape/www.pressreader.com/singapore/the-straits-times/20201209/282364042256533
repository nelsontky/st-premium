    <p>LONDON Eng­land were drawn with Poland and Hun­gary in their 2022 World Cup qual­i­fy­ing Group I on Mon­day – set­ting up en­coun­ters which re­call two of the most fa­mous and trau­matic nights in the Three Li­ons’ his­tory.</p>
    <p>In 1973, Eng­land were held to a 1-1 draw by Poland at Wem­b­ley which meant they failed to qual­ify for the 1974 World Cup – the first time they failed to reach the show­piece tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The hero­ics of Pol­ish goal­keeper Jan To­maszewski, who be­fore the game had been de­scribed as a “clown” by Brian Clough, work­ing as a TV pun­dit, haunted the English, who also failed to reach the 1978 World Cup in Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>“There is a great his­tory with that fix­ture,” said Eng­land man­ager Gareth South­gate. “There was a spell when we seemed to draw them all the time. I re­mem­ber some of them, I’m old enough to be in that bracket. The To­maszewski game is ob­vi­ously a leg­endary one.”</p>
    <p>This will be the sev­enth time that the two coun­tries meet in World Cup qual­i­fy­ing – most re­cently for the 2014 edi­tion in Brazil as well as for the 2006, 1998, 1994, 1990 edi­tions.</p>
    <p>Hun­gary in­flicted Eng­land’s first de­feat at Wem­b­ley by non-Bri­tish op­po­nents with their 6-3 win in 1953.</p>
    <p>The up­set by the Mighty Mag­yars forced some ma­jor tac­ti­cal re­think­ing in the English game, es­pe­cially after Hun­gary won 7-1 in the re­verse fix­ture in Bu­dapest a year later.</p>
    <p>“I’ve heard about those games and they were one of the lead­ing na­tions at the time,” South­gate said.</p>
    <p>Hun­gar­ian foot­ball has been in the dol­drums since, but hav­ing qual­i­fied for both Euro 2016 and Euro 2020, the team have some ex­cit­ing tal­ent com­ing through, like Red Bull Salzburg mid­fielder Do­minik Szo­bos­zlai, who has been linked with a move to Ar­se­nal when the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow opens.</p>
    <p>“They’ve got some very good young play­ers com­ing through ac­tu­ally, they had some good re­sults in the last Euro­pean Cham­pi­onships and had a good cam­paign in the re­cent Na­tions League,” said South­gate.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Mid­dles­brough boss be­lieves the chance to re­peat those feats will fire up their op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>“All of those nights with Eng­land are the op­por­tu­nity for coun­tries to make his­tory,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways an op­por­tu­nity for those op­po­nents to not only play well to try to beat Eng­land but also put them­selves on the map with Premier League clubs as well, so there’s al­ways lots of in­cen­tives for our op­po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>There was no group of death in Mon­day’s draw although world cham­pi­ons France have a tricky path to Qatar, with Group D also com­pris­ing Ukraine, Bos­nia and Herze­gov­ina and Fin­land, who beat Les Bleus in a friendly last month.</p>
    <p>“A qual­i­fy­ing cam­paign is al­ways a long road where there can be pit­falls,” coach Di­dier Deschamps said. “It is bet­ter to avoid them.”</p>
    <p>The other favourites like Spain, Ger­many, Por­tu­gal, Italy and Bel­gium are set to come through their groups with ease.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean qual­i­fiers be­gin in March, with 13 of the 55 teams go­ing through to the 32-team World Cup.</p>
    <p>There will be three rounds of fix­tures in March, three more in Septem­ber and two each in Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Only the win­ners of the 10 groups will qual­ify au­to­mat­i­cally for Qatar 2022, which will take place from Novem­ber to De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The 10 run­ners-up will go into the play-offs along­side the two best Na­tions League group win­ners who missed out on qual­i­fy­ing via the tra­di­tional path.</p>
    <p>Those play-offs, set for March 2022, will pro­duce three more qual­i­fiers in to­tal.</p>
