    <p>• Euro­pean Union lead­ers gath­ered yes­ter­day for crunch sum­mit talks on a multi­bil­lion-euro plan to breathe life into their economies, their first face-to­face sum­mit since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic plunged the bloc into its lat­est cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“It is a mo­ment of truth and am­bi­tion for Europe,” French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said as he ar­rived for the meet­ing of 27 lead­ers in Brus­sels af­ter weeks of ten­sion over the scale and scope of the res­cue fund. “It is our Euro­pean project that is at stake here. I am con­fi­dent but cau­tious.”</p>
    <p>Dutch op­po­si­tion and a threat of a Hun­gar­ian veto weigh on chances for a deal on the EU’s 2021-2027 bud­get, en­vis­aged at slightly above €1 tril­lion (S$1.59 tril­lion), and an at­tached new re­cov­ery fund worth €750 bil­lion meant to help re­build the south­ern economies af­fected the most by the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The 27 EU heads will meet in a room equipped with hand sani­tiser, as well as dis­in­fected head­sets to pro­vide trans­la­tion, at the Brus­sels EU head­quar­ters, which will un­usu­ally be de­void of jour­nal­ists as a health pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>The sum­mit is sched­uled to run for two days, though of­fi­cials said it could spill into to­mor­row if an agree­ment re­mains elu­sive.</p>
    <p>The stakes are high, with EU economies in free fall. Im­me­di­ate re­lief mea­sures such as short-time work schemes are run­ning out this sum­mer, paving the way for what some fear will be an au­tumn of deep eco­nomic malaise and dis­con­tent.</p>
    <p>That would risk dam­ag­ing the EU, al­ready strug­gling with the pro­tracted saga of Brexit and bruised by past crises, from the fi­nan­cial melt­down to mi­gra­tion feuds.</p>
    <p>That, in turn, could ex­pose it to more euroscep­tic, na­tion­al­ist and pro­tec­tion­ist forces and weaken its stand­ing against China, the United States or Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of feuds over medicine, med­i­cal gear, bor­der clo­sures and money to re­spond to the coro­n­avirus, the EU has al­ready agreed on a half-a-tril­lion euro scheme to cush­ion the first hit of the cri­sis, and nar­rowed some dif­fer­ences over how to fi­nance the kick-start­ing of eco­nomic growth over the long term.</p>
    <p>Dutch Prime Min­is­ter Mark Rutte is the main hold­out among a thrifty camp of north­ern, wealthy EU coun­tries de­mand­ing a smaller over­all pack­age, eco­nomic re­forms as a con­di­tion for funds, an ex­panded vet­ting process for grant­ing aid, and re­bates be kept for net pay­ers to the bloc’s joint cof­fers.</p>
    <p>The high-debt, ail­ing south­ern na­tions, in­clud­ing Italy and Spain, want the re­cov­ery fi­nanc­ing to come as free grants rather than re­payable loans, while Hun­gary has threat­ened to veto the whole pack­age over a pro­posed new mech­a­nism to freeze pay­outs for coun­tries un­der­cut­ting demo­cratic val­ues.</p>
    <p>Among the other stick­ing points are when to make the re­cov­ery money avail­able and for how long; how to re­pay debt to be ac­quired by the bloc’s ex­ec­u­tive Euro­pean Com­mis­sion to col­lect these ex­tra funds; and how much should be chan­nelled to green projects that help the EU to meet its emis­sions tar­gets.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 cli­mate-friendly projects could line up for a piece of the EU’s post-virus re­cov­ery pack­age. En­vi­ron­men­tal think-tanks have crit­i­cised the pro­posed bud­get for fall­ing short of what is needed to meet the bloc’s cur­rent goal to cut green­house gas emis­sions by at least 40 per cent against 1990 lev­els by 2030.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion has said the eco­nomic de­struc­tion wreaked by the virus would not shake its plans to make the EU “cli­mate neu­tral” by 2050, and promised that re­cov­ery spend­ing would drive green growth.</p>
