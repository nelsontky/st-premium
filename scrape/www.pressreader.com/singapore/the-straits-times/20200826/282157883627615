    <p>LON­DON • Com­pa­nies around the world have moved more of their oper­a­tions on­line, plan to re­duce of­fice space and have made re­cruit­ing and re­tain­ing staff their top pri­or­ity since the coronaviru­s pan­demic struck, a sur­vey showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by ac­count­ing firm KPMG showed that 80 per cent of busi­ness leaders had ac­cel­er­ated their dig­i­tal ex­pan­sion plans dur­ing the lock­down as they ad­justed to staff work­ing re­motely and deal­ing with cus­tomers on­line.</p>
    <p>There was un­cer­tainty about the even­tual scale of the shift away from shared workspaces in favour of work­ing from home, but 69 per cent were plan­ning to cut their of­fice space in the short term.</p>
    <p>“Maybe some kind of hy­brid finds its way into the new ev­ery­day re­al­ity,” said Mr Bill Thomas, global chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive of KPMG In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Seventy-three per cent said the shift to work­ing from home had in­creased the pool of job can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>That could lead to teams that are more spread out glob­ally and in­ter­act more on­line.</p>
    <p>“There’s a com­fort level with this that peo­ple have never had be­fore,” Mr Thomas said.</p>
    <p>Talent risk – cov­er­ing re­cruit­ment and re­ten­tion as well as the well-be­ing and health of staff – had jumped from 11th to first in a ranking of risks over the next three years for chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing be­hind were risks re­lated to sup­ply chains, as trade ten­sions grow on the back of the pan­demic, and en­vi­ron­men­tal and cli­mate change risks.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has split CEOs over the three-year out­look for the global econ­omy, with 32 per cent say­ing they are less con­fi­dent than they were at the start of this year and an­other 32 per cent say­ing they are more con­fi­dent.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, de­spite the un­cer­tainty of trade terms with the Euro­pean Union af­ter a post-Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends on Dec 31, CEOs were more bullish about their coun­try’s econ­omy than in all other coun­tries apart from China and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>KPMG sur­veyed 315 chief ex­ec­u­tives in Aus­tralia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Ja­pan, Bri­tain and the United States between July 6 and Aug 5 as part of its CEO Out­look, hav­ing ini­tially spo­ken to 1,300 CEOs in Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary.</p>
