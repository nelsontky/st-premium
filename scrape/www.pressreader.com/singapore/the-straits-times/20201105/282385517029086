    <p>In­vestors in Sin­ga­pore and glob­ally were stunned by the abrupt sus­pen­sion of Ant Group’s list­ing on the Shang­hai Stock Ex­change (SSE) less than two days be­fore the world’s largest ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO) was to take place in the Chi­nese city and in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Bro­kers say there had been a lot more in­ter­est than usual in the US$37 bil­lion (S$50.4 bil­lion) dual list­ing from Sin­ga­pore in­vestors, many of whom are now “in a state of shock”.</p>
    <p>Ahead of to­day’s list­ing, the fin­tech firm’s IPO had even started to trade at a 50 per cent pre­mium in the grey mar­ket, CMC Mar­kets mar­ket an­a­lyst Kelvin Wong said in a Tues­day re­port.</p>
    <p>This refers to an un­of­fi­cial mar­ket where peo­ple can bet on first­day IPO share price move­ments, bro­kers say.</p>
    <p>“Some trades were ex­e­cuted at HK$120 in the grey mar­ket (on Mon­day) ver­sus its Hong Kong list­ing price of HK$80,” Mr Wong noted.</p>
    <p>But the writ­ing was on the wall when Ant Group co-founder Jack Ma and two top ex­ec­u­tives were sum­moned to a meet­ing with Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The next day, the SSE suspended the mega IPO, say­ing that Ant has “re­ported on ma­te­rial mat­ters in­clud­ing a change in the reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment on fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy”.</p>
    <p>“Due to the ma­te­rial mat­ters re­ported, (Ant) may no longer meet the con­di­tions for of­fer­ing and list­ing, or the re­quire­ments for in­for­ma­tion dis­clo­sure... (Ant) and (its) spon­sors shall make public an­nounce­ments ac­cord­ing to reg­u­la­tions, ex­plain the sit­u­a­tions re­lated to the ma­te­rial mat­ters,” SSE said in an an­nounce­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The IPO has also been suspended in Hong Kong, Ant Group said.</p>
    <p>US-listed shares of Alibaba Group, which has a 33 per cent stake in Ant through its sub­sidiaries, plunged 8.1 per cent on Tues­day, mark­ing their largest sin­gle-day de­cline since Jan 29, 2015, when they lost 8.78 per cent.</p>
    <p>Un­cer­tainty over the reg­u­la­tors’ next move is not help­ing sen­ti­ment, said Mr Ter­ence Wong, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Azure Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“Even if they were to give the all­clear to the IPO, it may still leave a sour taste in in­vestors’ mouths given that this hap­pened on the eve of the list­ing,” he added.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the sus­pen­sion may mean Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors are wor­ried over whether sys­temic risks to the Chi­nese bank­ing sys­tem have been ad­e­quately ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun noted: “Ant has to de­cide if it can sat­isfy Chi­nese reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments as soon as pos­si­ble and whether to pro­ceed with the IPO or to re­fund the monies. The out­come also de­pends on whether Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors are sat­is­fied with the ac­tions taken by Ant.”</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported that Ant had been told that its con­sumer lend­ing busi­ness will face tougher scru­tiny over mat­ters in­clud­ing cap­i­tal ad­e­quacy and lever­age ra­tios.</p>
    <p>This comes as some reg­u­la­tors were “sur­prised” by Ant’s busi­ness and fi­nan­cial fig­ures, in­clud­ing the scale and prof­itabil­ity of its credit busi­ness, details of which were dis­closed for the first time in its IPO prospec­tus in late Au­gust, Reuters re­ported one source as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma’s re­cent crit­i­cism of reg­u­la­tors sti­fling in­no­va­tion could also have pro­voked Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors, ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>A Bloomberg re­port had quoted him as say­ing: “Good in­no­va­tion is not afraid of reg­u­la­tion, but is afraid of out­dated reg­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>The com­ments fu­elled the per­cep­tion that Ant con­sid­ered it­self dif­fer­ent and sub­ject to a dif­fer­ent set of rules, said Mr Frank Troise, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive of SoHo Ad­vi­sors.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors have made ex­plic­itly clear that safety comes first,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They have con­cluded that Ant should be sub­ject to sim­i­lar reg­u­la­tory over­sight (like) any fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion. This over­sight in­cludes the amount of lever­age that Ant can de­ploy in its lend­ing busi­ness, which when com­pared with its bank­ing peers may be seen as a po­ten­tial sys­temic risk.”</p>
    <p>But Mr Troise said he “ex­pects the sus­pen­sion to be lifted, and the IPO to move for­ward with a new set of fi­nan­cial as­sump­tions added into IPO dis­clo­sure doc­u­ments that in­cor­po­rate the reg­u­la­tor’s new re­quire­ments”.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Duan Jin-Chuan from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School said the tim­ing of the reg­u­la­tory ac­tion was a sur­prise and “mar­kets will de­mand a reval­u­a­tion to re­flect new reg­u­la­tory re­al­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>NUS Busi­ness School’s Ad­junct As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor James Cheng noted that “at the core, it is an is­sue of how the en­tire fi­nan­cial sec­tor’s profit mar­gin and risk are dis­trib­uted among players”.</p>
