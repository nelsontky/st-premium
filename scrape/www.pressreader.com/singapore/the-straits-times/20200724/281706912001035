    <p>No recre­ational travel is likely this year or early next year as coun­tries that are still knee-deep in the Covid-19 pan­demic con­tinue to play safe and keep tourists away.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at The Straits Times Covid-19 we­bi­nar, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said: “When we (travel), we end up be­ing ex­posed to many dif­fer­ent fac­tors that are be­yond our con­trol.”</p>
    <p>An­swer­ing a ques­tion posed by a par­tic­i­pant, he noted that Covid-19 transmissi­on could take place on the plane, at the ho­tel, or at lo­cal tourist at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing the ex­am­ple of Aus­tralia, he said the coun­try had al­most won the battle against Covid-19 last month but fresh out­breaks have now been re­ported in Melbourne and New South Wales.</p>
    <p>“If we look at what’s hap­pen­ing in Hong Kong and Aus­tralia right now, the sit­u­a­tion changed very quickly within a mat­ter of two to four weeks.</p>
    <p>“So, when it comes to mass mar­ket tourism, re­gret­tably, I think we will not be able to travel out of Sin­ga­pore for the fore­see­able fu­ture,” Prof Teo added.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested tak­ing a stay­ca­tion in Pu­lau Ubin or Sen­tosa in­stead.</p>
    <p>His com­ments come a few days af­ter Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said leisure travel was un­likely this year, al­though es­sen­tial busi­ness travel was pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Mr Wong, who cochairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19, said it is un­likely that the in­fec­tion world­wide will dis­ap­pear by the end of the year, mak­ing travel risky.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ne­go­ti­a­tions with coun­tries on re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments will con­tinue, to al­low for es­sen­tial busi­ness travel as long as mu­tual con­trol mea­sures are in place.</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing in on the dis­cus­sion dur­ing the we­bi­nar, Pro­fes­sor Dale</p>
    <p>Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, noted that the­o­ret­i­cally, leisure travel is pos­si­ble be­tween like-minded coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The key is trust in each other’s health­care sys­tems and pro­cesses, as well as the man­age­ment and con­tain­ment of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said: “For in­stance, we would be com­fort­able with China be­cause as soon as they get a case, they will lock down the whole area, swab ev­ery­one within a cer­tain ra­dius, and we could be com­fort­able that China is not go­ing to send any po­ten­tial Covid-19 cases to Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
