    <p>Many in­vestors like to think of them­selves as pretty good mar­ket timers, able to con­sis­tently buy low and sell high.</p>
    <p>Some may get lucky from time to time, but those rare suc­cesses can lead to delu­sional over­con­fi­dence – “I saw that crash com­ing!” Add to that a dol­lop of se­lec­tive re­ten­tion as to one’s past suc­cesses and you end up with a recipe for false be­lief in one’s abil­ity to jump in and out of mar­kets at the right times.</p>
    <p>Those of you who fan­ta­sise about be­ing able to sidestep the down­turns but still par­tic­i­pate in the re­cov­er­ies should ask your­self these sim­ple ques­tions:</p>
    <p>What re­peat­able, not chance-based process would have had you sell­ing eq­ui­ties in late Fe­bru­ary near the highs?</p>
    <p>What process would you have fol­lowed to buy back in af­ter the 34 per cent col­lapse?</p>
    <p>Would you have had the dis­ci­pline to ig­nore your in­stincts to make a timely re­pur­chase near the</p>
    <p>March 23 lows?</p>
    <p>Both ends of that trade are hard to time, emo­tion­ally chal­leng­ing to ex­e­cute and more costly than many peo­ple re­alise.</p>
    <p>I was re­minded of the risks of try­ing to time the mar­ket by a re­cent col­umn from my Bloomberg Opin­ion col­league Farnoosh Torabi. Last month, Ms Torabi ex­plained why she was re­duc­ing her eq­uity ex­po­sure from 81 per cent of her port­fo­lio to 60 per cent, and tripling her fixed-in­come hold­ings to 27 per cent in her re­tire­ment ac­counts. For a va­ri­ety of rea­sons, not least of which is her age – she has decades be­fore she re­tires – I would have ad­vised her against those ac­tions.</p>
    <p>As some­one who has had a de­cent amount of luck in the tim­ing space – em­pha­sis on the word “luck” – I am both fas­ci­nated and hor­ri­fied by how tim­ing is done by re­tail in­vestors. Given 2020’s first-quar­ter sell-off and new highs in the third quar­ter, let’s con­sider all that goes into at­tempt­ing to time the mar­ket, its emo­tional chal­lenges and fi­nan­cial costs.</p>
    <p>THE EXIT</p>
    <p>What mo­ti­vates peo­ple to exit eq­ui­ties, in whole or in part? Most of the time, it is emo­tion.</p>
    <p>I al­most never hear in­vestors say: “Ev­ery­thing is go­ing great, the mar­ket and the econ­omy look fan­tas­tic. Liq­ui­date all of my hold­ings im­me­di­ately!”</p>
    <p>But that is pretty much what you would need to do to catch the mar­ket at a top.</p>
    <p>It is rarely cool, con­tem­pla­tive anal­y­sis about a high­prob­a­bil­ity event that no one else sees. Those are in­cred­i­bly rare, as is hav­ing the per­son­al­ity to man­age the process.</p>
    <p>What tends to hap­pen is that as mar­kets fall, the drum­beat of bad news feeds upon it­self.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, that leads to panic. Too of­ten, the exit is part of what tech­ni­cal types call “ca­pit­u­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>The word means “to­tal sur­ren­der” and it usu­ally re­sults in do­ing what­ever it takes to make the pain stop. There is no short­age of stud­ies show­ing that strat­egy is never the recipe for strong mar­ket re­turns.</p>
    <p>THE RE-EN­TRY</p>
    <p>Get­ting back in when ev­ery­one else wants out is even harder to do. We have evolved as so­cial pri­mates, and our skills in co­op­er­a­tion and group dy­nam­ics cre­ate a dis­tinct sur­vival ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Do­ing the ex­act op­po­site of what your peers are do­ing re­quires fight­ing your most ba­sic in­stincts. Buy­ing into a panic sell-off is much eas­ier said than done.</p>
    <p>You have a choice of a va­ri­ety of in­di­ca­tors – tech­ni­cal, quan­ti­ta­tive, sen­ti­ment, mo­men­tum, eco­nomic – but none has shown reli­a­bil­ity in nail­ing the lows.</p>
    <p>Catch­ing the bot­tom re­quires three things: First, you must have a sub­jec­tive feel for when stocks have reached their nadir and that the sell­ing has reached its con­clu­sion. Sec­ond, you must have con­vic­tion in your abil­ity to do what nearly all in­vestors can­not. And last, you must have the dis­ci­pline to act on your be­liefs, fol­low­ing your trad­ing plan de­spite the may­hem that oc­curs near mar­ket bot­toms.</p>
    <p>If any of this were easy, peo­ple would nail the lows all the time, but we know they don’t.</p>
    <p>It turns out that most peo­ple are much bet­ter off merely rid­ing it out than try­ing to time the mar­ket. Un­less you have de­vel­oped a se­cret for­mula that none of the PhDs roam­ing Wall Street have been able to repli­cate that en­sures be­ing able to suc­cess­fully move in and out of eq­ui­ties, do your fu­ture self a favour and stay away from mar­ket tim­ing.</p>
    <p>I wrote ex­ten­sively about the com­ing real es­tate crash and its im­pact on the stock mar­ket. I sug­gested the Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age stocks were 25 per cent over­val­ued, worth closer to 9,800 than the 13,000 they were trad­ing for at the time.</p>
    <p>Break­ing 10,000 would likely cause a 3,000 point panic, which led me to sug­gest Dow 6,800 as a po­ten­tial down­side tar­get. That call was widely ridiculed.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing long in most of 2007, my firm was 100 per cent cash as of Jan­uary 2008, ex­cept for the stocks we were short. In March 2009, I flipped to ag­gres­sively bullish.</p>
