    <p>A day trip to the Sis­ters’ Is­lands Marine Park turned into a tragedy for two fam­i­lies on Sun­day when a fa­ther did not re­turn af­ter he went on a recce for good swim­ming spots.</p>
    <p>The body of 41-year-old An­toni, a Sin­ga­porean who goes by one name, was found in the wa­ters on Tues­day evening, fol­low­ing a three-day search by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times at Mr An­toni’s wake yes­ter­day, his brother-in-law said the man was a very re­spon­si­ble fa­ther of two daugh­ters, and he had been look­ing out for the safety of the chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The group, con­sist­ing of the busi­ness­man’s fam­ily and an­other re­lated fam­ily, had ar­rived on the is­land past 10am on Sun­day, re­counted the brother-in-law, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>As the other adults were set­tling down at the park, Mr An­toni set off on his own to look for a good spot for the chil­dren to swim, snorkel and see the corals, said Mr Lim, who is in his mid-30s.</p>
    <p>When Mr An­toni did not re­turn af­ter about half an hour, the group started to worry as “it was not like him to dis­ap­pear”, said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>“They went into a panic mode, and they started search­ing for him around the is­land,” he added.</p>
    <p>The group searched in vain for Mr An­toni on foot, and sought the help of the au­thor­i­ties soon af­ter, said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>The po­lice, who were alerted to the in­ci­dent at about 12.40pm that day, mounted a search and res­cue op­er­a­tion for the miss­ing man with the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force.</p>
    <p>His body was pulled from the wa­ters near the is­land at about 5.45pm on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim added that the group be­lieved the wa­ters were quite shal­low, and they did not think the cur­rents could have pulled Mr An­toni away.</p>
    <p>The weather was also clear then, said Mr Lim, adding that Mr An­toni would not oth­er­wise have gone into the wa­ters.</p>
    <p>The fam­i­lies are still in the dark about what had hap­pened to Mr An­toni af­ter he left them, said Mr Lim, who re­quested pri­vacy for the vic­tim’s grieving wife and daugh­ters, who are aged 12 and be­low.</p>
    <p>He added that Mr An­toni was a very fil­ial son-in-law and good brother-in-law who cared for the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“He was al­ways ready to help. When we called for help, he was al­ways the first to be there,” said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they are in­ves­ti­gat­ing Mr An­toni’s un­nat­u­ral death.</p>
    <p>The group searched in vain for Mr An­toni on foot, and sought the help of the au­thor­i­ties soon af­ter, said Mr Lim (Mr An­toni’s brother-in-law).</p>
