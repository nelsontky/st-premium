    <p>In Chi­nese-Amer­i­can writer Li Yiyun’s new novel Must I Go, oc­to­ge­nar­ian Lilia Liska an­no­tates the mem­oir of an ex-lover with whom she had a daugh­ter, Lucy. He never knew about her and she killed her­self at the age of 27.</p>
    <p>Li was 44 – the same age Lilia is when her daugh­ter dies – when she wrote this in 2017. Shortly after­wards, her elder son Vin­cent, 16, com­mit­ted sui­cide.</p>
    <p>“In a cer­tain way, I think life is stranger than fic­tion,” says Li over Skype from Prince­ton, New Jersey.</p>
    <p>“If you make life into fic­tion, peo­ple would not find it be­liev­able. Right after my son died, I thought I could not pos­si­bly leave Lucy as that child in the book be­cause of the co­in­ci­dence of the over­lap­ping of Lilia’s biog­ra­phy and mine. But it had al­ready hap­pened to her, so I could not change that.”</p>
    <p>Li set Must I Go aside and poured her­self in­stead into Where Rea­sons End (2019), a di­a­logue be­tween a mother and her son in the wake of his sui­cide.</p>
    <p>Un­like her other nov­els, she wrote Where Rea­sons End swiftly, briefly and as a sin­gle draft.</p>
    <p>“I could have writ­ten that book my whole life,” she says, “and it would have been a dif­fer­ent book every year. So I wanted to keep it short and also not re­vise it, so ev­ery­thing re­mained as they were pre­sented.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, she con­sid­ered aban­don­ing Lilia for good. But her char­ac­ters are like real peo­ple to her, she says, and Lilia was so much fun – caus­tic, un­con­tain­able, the kind of woman who says things like: “If you think about it, we never ask our­selves whose death date we’ll be shar­ing. That’s one thing I would die to know.”</p>
    <p>“She was crack­ling,” re­calls Li. “She cracked me up.”</p>
    <p>On the in­sis­tence of friends, she fi­nally re­turned to Must I Go.</p>
    <p>“It’s just like go­ing into a re­ally cold swim­ming pool. You just have to jump in. Then you’re okay.”</p>
    <p>In Must I Go, the reader meets Lilia aged 81 in a care home. She has had three hus­bands and raised five chil­dren. Of late, she has be­come fix­ated by the diaries of Roland Bouley, whom she had a fling with in her teens when he vis­ited her fam­ily’s ranch in Cal­i­for­nia and sub­se­quently got preg­nant with Lucy.</p>
    <p>The diaries were pub­lished by a van­ity press after his death. Lilia her­self ap­pears in their pages only five times as “L”, “the kind of girl my fu­ture wife would dis­ap­prove of”.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways like to read peo­ple’s diaries, es­pe­cially peo­ple who are for­got­ten now,” says Li.</p>
    <p>“I was read­ing some lit­tle man’s di­ary – I say lit­tle, be­cause he’s just not his­tor­i­cally im­por­tant – and he com­plained about his line, as men like to do. He did not have a child in his mar­riage and he said, ‘If there was an il­le­git­i­mate child born to me, that b*****d was not known to me’.</p>
    <p>“As a fic­tion writer, when­ever you see some­thing like that, you just think, there must be a child born some­where. Who’s that child? And who is the mother? So that’s where Lilia started.”</p>
    <p>Li, who is mar­ried with one other son, has her­self re­sisted au­to­bi­og­ra­phy in the past – the clos­est she has come is her 2017 mem­oir Dear Friend, From My Life I Write To You In Your Life, in which she ex­am­ines her own de­pres­sion, sui­cide at­tempts and time in a men­tal hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>She was born in Bei­jing and moved to the United States in 1996 when she was 23. Once a sci­en­tist, she turned to writ­ing fic­tion in English, pen­ning the award-win­ning short sto­ries of A Thou­sand Years Of Good Prayers (2005).</p>
    <p>Her first two nov­els are set in the wake of China’s Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion. The Va­grants (2009) fol­lows the bru­tal ex­e­cu­tion of a young woman who was a Red Guard, while Kinder Than Soli­tude (2014) is about the mys­te­ri­ous poi­son­ing and pro­tracted death of a young Tianan­men Square pro­tester.</p>
    <p>Li feels that Must I Go, set mostly in Cal­i­for­nia, is “prob­a­bly my least Chi­nese book”.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t have to be writ­ten by me. It could have been writ­ten by an Amer­i­can or Bri­tish writer. An au­thor’s ori­gin and a book’s ori­gin are dif­fer­ent, but it’s prob­a­bly dif­fi­cult for peo­ple to sep­a­rate them.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple tend to as­sume that writ­ing about grief brings clo­sure.</p>
    <p>Li dis­agrees. “I re­sist us­ing the word grief be­cause of the et­y­mol­ogy of grief, com­ing from Greek, as some­thing bur­den­ing you, that you work through and it is no longer so heavy, no longer a bur­den to your life.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it’s a bur­den. I don’t think that you get through your griev­ing and no longer miss the per­son you have lost. I don’t be­lieve in clo­sure.”</p>
