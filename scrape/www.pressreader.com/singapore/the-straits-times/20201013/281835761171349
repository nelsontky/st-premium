    <p>•</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping is set to visit Shen­zhen this week to shore up plans to make south­ern China a global tech­nol­ogy hub, prompt­ing Hong Kong leader Car­rie Lam to de­lay an an­nual eco­nomic pol­icy ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi is sched­uled to de­liver an ad­dress to­mor­row and meet the lead­ers of Hong Kong and Ma­cau, the of­fi­cial Xinhua News Agency said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The trip is in­tended to mark the 40th an­niver­sary of the spe­cial eco­nomic zone that trans­formed Shen­zhen from a sleepy fish­ing vil­lage into a bustling me­trop­o­lis of more than 13 mil­lion peo­ple and home to multi­na­tional com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Huawei and Ten­cent.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam can­celled the pol­icy speech sched­uled for to­mor­row to at­tend the fes­tiv­i­ties, and said in a brief­ing yes­ter­day that she now aimed to de­liver it by late Novem­ber af­ter trav­el­ling to Bei­jing to brief Com­mu­nist Party of­fi­cials on her plans. She de­nied that she was “wait­ing for direc­tions” from Bei­jing be­fore giv­ing the speech, say­ing in­stead that the cen­tral gov­ern­ment wants to “fa­cil­i­tate those pol­icy mea­sures” to help the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The best way for­ward is for the Chief Ex­ec­u­tive to go to Bei­jing and per­son­ally ex­plain why these mea­sures are i mpor­tant for Hong Kong,” Mrs Lam said. “This is a very good op­por­tu­nity that no Chief Ex­ec­u­tive would forgo.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam’s de­ci­sion shows just how much pol­i­cy­mak­ers in Bei­jing are call­ing the shots in Hong Kong. Mr Xi’s gov­ern­ment ear­lier this year im­posed a sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong that gave Bei­jing the power to in­ter­vene in the le­gal sys­tem for the first time, prompt­ing the United States to sanc­tion of­fi­cials for un­der­min­ing the ter­ri­tory’s au­ton­omy promised when Bri­tain handed it over to China in 1997.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese shares listed in Hong Kong saw their big­gest gain since early July on op­ti­mism that Mr Xi could un­veil plans to fur­ther open the na­tion’s econ­omy to for­eign in­vest­ment, with the Hang Seng China En­ter­prises In­dex climb­ing 2.7 per cent at the close.</p>
    <p>The gauge has un­der­per­formed its main­land peers this year, fall­ing 12 per cent ver­sus an 18 per cent rally for the CSI 300 In­dex of key stocks listed in Shang­hai and Shen­zhen. Xiaomi rose 8.4 per cent to lead gains on the mea­sure of off­shore China stocks yes­ter­day, while China Uni­com Hong Kong and China Tele­com rose at least 5.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nist Party in­tends to build Shen­zhen, a stone’s throw from Hong Kong across the main­land bor­der, into a “so­cial­ist pi­lot zone with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics” over the next five years, Xinhua re­ported on Sun­day, pub­lish­ing an out­line of the plan.</p>
    <p>China will push for­ward co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Shen­zhen and Hong Kong to a “higher level” to strengthen the key role in the Greater Bay Area, said Xinhua. It did not give more de­tails. Shen­zhen will host a trial on the dig­i­tal yuan and push for­ward with in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, it added.</p>
    <p>Plans for the Greater Bay Area call for bet­ter in­te­grat­ing Shen­zhen, the sur­round­ing province of Guang­dong and the for­mer colonies of Hong Kong and Ma­cau. The am­bi­tious ef­fort faces new chal­lenges amid trade and se­cu­rity dis­putes with the US, anx­i­ety over the new se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong and travel re­stric­tions prompted by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The re­port sug­gests a prom­i­nent role for the Greater Bay Area in China’s next five-year de­vel­op­ment, which is ex­pected to be ap­proved by law­mak­ers next year. Top party lead­ers are sched­uled to con­vene on Oct 26 to dis­cuss an out­line for the five-year plan.</p>
