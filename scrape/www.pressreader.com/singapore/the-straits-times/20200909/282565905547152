    <p>NEW YORK • In April, as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic brought the con­cert in­dus­try to a halt, Amer­i­can pop star Tay­lor Swift can­celled all her tour dates for the year.</p>
    <p>“I’m so sad I won’t be able to see you guys in con­cert this year, but I know this is the right de­ci­sion,” she wrote on Twit­ter, giv­ing her fans no in­di­ca­tion that they would see her again, in any form, un­til next year.</p>
    <p>Three months later, the 30-year-old singer emerged from quar­an­tine with Folk­lore, a clas­sic sur­prise re­lease that has dom­i­nated the Bill­board al­bum chart this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Now, it is in its sixth week at No. 1, the long­est streak at the top of the chart for any al­bum since Cana­dian rap­per Drake’s Views four years ago.</p>
    <p>In its sixth week out, Folk­lore has the equiv­a­lent of 90,000 al­bum sales in the United States, in­clud­ing streams as well as copies sold as a com­plete pack­age.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sell­ing 17 phys­i­cal ver­sions of the al­bum through her web­site for the first two weeks, Swift has lately been sur­pris­ing fans by send­ing au­to­graphed copies of the CD to in­die record stores.</p>
    <p>In the US, Folk­lore has sold 860,000 copies of its com­plete al­bum ver­sion – count­ing down­loads as well as its var­i­ous phys­i­cal ver­sions – and nearly 700 mil­lion streams.</p>
    <p>Around the world, the al­bum is “near­ing” two bil­lion streams, said Swift’s la­bel, Repub­lic, a divi­sion of the gi­ant Univer­sal Mu­sic Group.</p>
    <p>Also this week, heavy metal band Me­tal­lica opened at No. 4 with S&M2, a live al­bum recorded with the San Fran­cisco Sym­phony; and singer Katy Perry’s new al­bum, Smile, started at No. 5.</p>
    <p>Two post­hu­mous rap al­bums held their po­si­tions just below Folk­lore: Pop Smoke’s Shoot For The Stars, Aim For The Moon was No. 2 and Juice WRLD’s Le­gends Never Die was No. 3.</p>
