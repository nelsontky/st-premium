    <p>DOHA • Qatar an­nounced yes­ter­day it will seek to host the 2032 Olympic Games, join­ing a crowded field and rais­ing ques­tions about scorch­ing sum­mer tem­per­a­tures and un­der­whelm­ing at­ten­dances at past events.</p>
    <p>In­dia, Aus­tralia’s Queens­land state, the Chi­nese city of Shang­hai and a po­ten­tial joint bid be­tween South and North Korea are also be­ing touted for the 2032 Sum­mer Games.</p>
    <p>Un­der changes put for­ward in 2014, in­ter­ested coun­tries sub­mit a re­quest to join the non-com­mit­tal “con­tin­u­ous di­a­logue”, which Qatar con­firmed it had done via a let­ter to the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) in Lau­sanne.</p>
    <p>“To­day’s an­nounce­ment marks the be­gin­ning of a mean­ing­ful di­a­logue with the IOC’s fu­ture host com­mis­sion to ex­plore our in­ter­est fur­ther and iden­tify how the Olympic Games can sup­port</p>
    <p>Qatar’s long-term de­vel­op­ment goals,” Qatar Olympic Com­mit­tee pres­i­dent Sheikh Joaan Ha­mad Khal­ifa Al-Thani said.</p>
    <p>Qatar un­suc­cess­fully bid to host the 2016 and 2020 Games, hav­ing pro­posed to host the former in Oc­to­ber with­out first clear­ing it with the IOC. It won a waiver to pro­pose host­ing the 2020 Games, a joint bid with Baku, Azer­bai­jan be­tween Sept 20 and Oct 20, but failed to make the short­list.</p>
    <p>The 2020 Games, post­poned to next year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, were awarded to Tokyo, which also ex­pe­ri­ences sear­ing sum­mer tem­per­a­tures, lead­ing of­fi­cials to sched­ule events in morn­ings when con­di­tions are coolest.</p>
    <p>“Qatar has earned the rep­u­ta­tion of a world-class des­ti­na­tion for ma­jor sport­ing events,” added Sheikh Joaan, brother of Qatar’s ruler Emir Sheikh Tamim Ha­mad Al-Thani.</p>
    <p>“It is this proven track-record and wealth of ex­pe­ri­ence, along with our de­sire to use sport to pro­mote peace and cul­tural ex­change, that will form the ba­sis of our dis­cus­sions with the com­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>Key sports events held in Qatar in­clude the Qatar Mas­ters (golf), Qatar ExxonMo­bil Ten­nis Open, Qatar To­tal Ten­nis Open, Mo­toGP’s Grand Prix of Qatar, and the IAAF Di­a­mond League (ath­let­ics).</p>
    <p>Sum­mer tem­per­a­tures can reach 50 deg C in the na­tion which abuts the Ara­bian desert. Heat and hu­mid­ity were ma­jor is­sues dur­ing the road races at last year’s World Ath­let­ics Cham­pi­onships held in Doha. The poor at­ten­dance on the first few days also at­tracted crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>The Olympics have never been hosted in the Mid­dle East, and Qatar will be the first na­tion in the re­gion to host foot­ball’s big­gest show­piece. It has in­vested bil­lions of dol­lars in pre­par­ing for the 2022 World Cup. How­ever, hu­man rights groups have crit­i­cised the treat­ment of mi­grant work­ers there.</p>
    <p>The Qatari govern­ment has said it does not tol­er­ate un­scrupu­lous treat­ment of work­ers.</p>
