    <p>DEADLY HABIT</p>
    <p>The min­i­mum le­gal age for the pur­chase, use, pos­ses­sion, sale and sup­ply of to­bacco prod­ucts will be raised from the cur­rent 20 years old to 21 from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>This is the third and last change to the min­i­mum age re­quire­ment un­der the amend­ments to the To­bacco (Control of Ad­ver­tise­ments and Sale) Act, which were passed in Par­lia­ment in Novem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>The min­i­mum le­gal age was first raised from 18 to 19 years old on Jan 1 last year, and from 19 to 20 years old on Jan 1 this year.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day re­minded the public of the changes, and said that rais­ing the min­i­mum le­gal age is part of Sin­ga­pore’s on­go­ing ef­forts to re­duce smok­ing preva­lence.</p>
    <p>Other ef­forts by the min­istry, to­gether with the Health Pro­mo­tion Board and the Health Sciences Author­ity (HSA), in­clude public ed­u­ca­tion, tax­a­tion, smok­ing ces­sa­tion pro­grammes, bans on to­bacco ad­ver­tis­ing, point-of-sale dis­play ban, and stan­dard­ised pack­ag­ing of to­bacco prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“To­bacco use is one of the high­est con­trib­u­tors to ill health and pre­ma­ture death in Sin­ga­pore. It is as­so­ci­ated with can­cers, is­chaemic heart dis­ease, stroke, lung dis­ease and many other dis­eases,” MOH added.</p>
    <p>Warn­ing notices, which state that the sale of to­bacco to per­sons be­low the age of 21 is not per­mit­ted, have been dis­trib­uted to re­tail­ers for dis­play at their out­lets.</p>
    <p>Un­der­age smok­ers con­victed of us­ing, buy­ing or pos­sess­ing to­bacco prod­ucts face a fine of up to $300.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers who are guilty of con­tra­ven­ing the law and sell­ing to­bacco prod­ucts to a per­son be­low the min­i­mum le­gal age face a fine of up to $5,000 for the first of­fence and $10,000 for sub­se­quent of­fences.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, their to­bacco re­tail li­cences will be sus­pended for the first of­fence and re­voked for sub­se­quent of­fences.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if an out­let is found sell­ing to­bacco prod­ucts to un­der­age per­sons in school uni­form or those be­low the age of 12, its to­bacco re­tail li­cence will be re­voked, even for the first of­fence.</p>
    <p>Those guilty of giv­ing or fur­nish­ing to­bacco to a per­son be­low the min­i­mum le­gal age face a fine of up to $500 for the first of­fence and $1,000 for sub­se­quent of­fences.</p>
    <p>Per­sons con­victed of buy­ing or ac­quir­ing to­bacco for a per­son be­low the min­i­mum le­gal age face a fine of up to $2,500 for the first of­fence and $5,000 for sub­se­quent of­fences.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the public can re­port er­rant re­tail­ers to HSA’s To­bacco Reg­u­la­tion Branch via the on­line form at go.gov.sg/re­port to­bac­coof­fences</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, the public can call 6684-2036 or 6684-2037 from 9am to 5.30pm on week­days.</p>
    <p>To­bacco use is one of the high­est con­trib­u­tors to ill health and pre­ma­ture death in Sin­ga­pore. It is as­so­ci­ated with can­cers, is­chaemic heart dis­ease, stroke, lung dis­ease and many other dis­eases.</p>
