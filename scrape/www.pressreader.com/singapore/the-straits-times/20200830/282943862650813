    <p>Q The Govern­ment has un­veiled var­i­ous Covid-19 re­lief schemes to help Sin­ga­pore­ans. What are some of the schemes avail­able and where can I find in­for­ma­tion on them?</p>
    <p>A The first step is to visit sup­port gowhere.gov.sg to see if you are el­i­gi­ble. If you qual­ify, you can sub­mit an ap­pli­ca­tion on­line as well. Most of these schemes are meant to help res­i­dents of HDB flats and some lower-value pri­vate prop­er­ties and peo­ple on low in­comes. Some of these schemes in­clude:</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Those who have been re­trenched can re­ceive up to $800 for three months while peo­ple who have had a pay cut of at least 30 per cent can ap­ply for $500 a month for three months. They can also get job and train­ing sup­port.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>This aims to help peo­ple whose busi­ness earns less than $100,000 in an­nual net trade in­come. Those el­i­gi­ble will re­ceive three quar­terly pay­ments of $3,000.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>This scheme al­lows some­one with a dis­abil­ity or stu­dents who are 25 and un­der to buy a desk­top com­puter or lap­top at prices starting from $220. There is also an op­tion to bun­dle three years of free fi­bre broad­band sub­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Low-in­come HDB res­i­dents can ap­ply for this scheme, which pro­vides for sub­sidised fi­bre broad­band for two years, with an op­tion to bun­dle it with a tablet or smart­phone.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, there are var­i­ous mea­sures of­fered au­to­mat­i­cally to el­i­gi­ble house­holds and low-in­come fam­i­lies. These in­clude 11/ to 31/</p>
    <p>2 2 months of ser­vice and con­ser­vancy charge re­bates, en­hanced gro­cery vouch­ers for those liv­ing in one- and two-room flats, as well as en­hanced Work­fare spe­cial pay­ments.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to these ben­e­fits, if you have prob­lems pay­ing off your loans, you can ap­ply to de­fer re­pay­ments un­til the end of the year. These in­clude loans for homes, com­mer­cial prop­er­ties, ren­o­va­tion, stud­ies and ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Q How do those over 56 con­tinue with re­tire­ment plan­ning dur­ing the pan­demic?</p>
    <p>A The fact that you can with­draw some sav­ings from your Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) at 55 does not mean that re­tire­ment plan­ning ends then. In­deed, as many peo­ple ex­pect to live longer now due to bet­ter health­care, those who hit 55 are still con­sid­ered “young” to­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, they can still work for an­other eight to 13 years be­cause the re­tire­ment age will be raised to 63 by 2022, and the re-em­ploy­ment age will go up to 68.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that you have suf­fi­cient money for your later years, you should con­tinue to use your CPF be­cause it is the best re­tire­ment plan­ning tool Sin­ga­pore­ans can have.</p>
    <p>You can con­sider the fol­low­ing:</p>
    <p>Top up your CPF Life to the En­hanced Re­tire­ment Sum</p>
    <p>Quite a num­ber of peo­ple mis­tak­enly be­lieve that CPF Life is but a scheme that is aimed at pre­vent­ing peo­ple from with­draw­ing all their money at 55.</p>
    <p>Thus, they choose to set aside the low­est re­tire­ment sum, which is $90,500 this year. Those who do so will re­ceive only up to about $800 monthly from age 65.</p>
    <p>But if you set aside more for your CPF Life, you will re­ceive more.</p>
    <p>If you set aside the Full Re­tire­ment Sum at $181,000, you will get up to $1,500 in monthly pay­outs, while those who set aside the En­hanced Re­tire­ment Sum at $271,500 can get up to $2,200 a month.</p>
    <p>If a cou­ple both choose to set aside the high­est sums for their CPF Life, they can get a to­tal of $4,400 a month from 65. This is a sound strat­egy that can most cer­tainly en­able them to re­tire with­out hav­ing to work from 65.</p>
    <p>So for those who have opted to set aside the lower re­tire­ment sums, it is still not too late to do cash top-ups – as much as you can and as reg­u­larly as you can – so that you can en­joy higher monthly pay­outs from 65.</p>
    <p>Use the CPF to grow extra cash</p>
    <p>Of course, savvy in­vestors can boost their re­tire­ment funds by pick­ing up cheap stocks in a down­turn. But all such in­vest­ments come with high risk as there is no telling how long the pan­demic will last.</p>
    <p>If you value se­cu­rity more than re­turns, the CPF is your best friend again. Af­ter set­ting aside the re­quired re­tire­ment sum for CPF Life at 55, all ex­cess funds in your Or­di­nary Ac­count is yours to use any time. But you should use the cash in your bank ac­count first be­cause the money in CPF still earns a 2.5 per cent in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>No bank ac­count or even bonds can of­fer this kind of re­turns now.</p>
    <p>If you have pre­vi­ously used the CPF to pay for home loans, you can use extra cash to re­fund up to the to­tal used so that you can earn the high in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Q Which op­tion is bet­ter? Top up my par­ents’ CPF ac­count to earn higher in­ter­est or put money into the SRS to earn in­come tax re­lief?</p>
    <p>A If you have the lux­ury of spare cash, do both be­cause each can save you from pay­ing more tax.</p>
    <p>If you are un­der 55 and have not hit the Full Re­tire­ment Sum in your Spe­cial Ac­count, you should top up for your­self to earn tax re­lief ($7,000 a year) as well as the 4 per cent in­ter­est rate.</p>
    <p>The money in the Sup­ple­men­tary Re­tire­ment Scheme (SRS) earns only 0.05 per cent in­ter­est. If you value re­turns more than gain­ing tax re­lief, you can find ways to put more money back to your CPF, such as through top-ups and re­fund of money used to pay hous­ing loan, to en­joy its 2.5 per cent in­ter­est rate.</p>
