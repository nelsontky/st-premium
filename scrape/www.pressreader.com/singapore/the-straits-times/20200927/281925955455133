    <p>NEW YORK Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga told the UN Gen­eral Assem­bly that Ja­pan is de­ter­mined to host the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 af­ter the Games were post­poned due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Games were orig­i­nally sched­uled for this sum­mer, but were put off for a year in March by the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee and the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“In the sum­mer of next year,</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is de­ter­mined to host the Tokyo Olympic and Par­a­lympic Games as proof that hu­man­ity has de­feated the pan­demic,” Mr Suga said on Friday in a recorded mes­sage. “I will con­tinue to spare no ef­fort in or­der to wel­come you to Games that are safe and se­cure,” he said in his de­but speech to the United Na­tions as Ja­pan’s leader.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga be­came Prime Min­is­ter this month af­ter Mr Shinzo Abe stepped down due to poor health.</p>
    <p>Tokyo Olympics’ or­gan­is­ers on Friday pro­posed cut­ting back the num­ber of staff at next year’s events and short­en­ing the open­ing pe­riod for train­ing venues, as part of a plan to hold a stream­lined event amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga also de­clared his will­ing­ness to meet North Korea’s Kim Jong Un with­out pre­con­di­tions, af­firm­ing the pol­icy of his pre­de­ces­sor. Ja­pan would seek to nor­malise ties with North Korea by re­solv­ing nu­clear weapons and mis­sile is­sues, as well as ab­duc­tions of Ja­panese cit­i­zens, Mr Suga told the Gen­eral Assem­bly in re­marks that lo­cal me­dia said were recorded al­most a week ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“Estab­lish­ing a con­struc­tive re­la­tion­ship be­tween Ja­pan and North Korea will not only serve the in­ter­ests of both sides but will also greatly con­trib­ute to re­gional peace and sta­bil­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>While the speech was Mr Suga’s first op­por­tu­nity to lay out a vi­sion for Ja­pan’s role in the world af­ter his elec­tion, his re­marks em­pha­sised con­ti­nu­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga – a 71-year-old straw­berry farmer’s son – has less diplo­matic ex­pe­ri­ence than Mr Abe, who also pub­licly of­fered to meet Mr Kim, with lit­tle suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga pre­vi­ously said Ja­pan’s al­liance with the US would re­main the cor­ner­stone of the coun­try’s for­eign pol­icy, as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion clashes with China over trade and se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Some in Mr Suga’s own party are also call­ing for a harder line with the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment over ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes and the clam­p­down on Hong Kong. That presents Mr Suga with a prob­lem. Mr Abe mended ties with China, his coun­try’s big­gest trade part­ner, only to see his plans to cel­e­brate the im­prove­ment with a state visit by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping de­railed by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga spoke to South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in last Thurs­day, break­ing a nine-month si­lence</p>
    <p>In the sum­mer of next year, Ja­pan is de­ter­mined to host the Tokyo Olympic and Par­a­lympic Games as proof that hu­man­ity has de­feated the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>JA­PANESE PRIME MIN­IS­TER YOSHI­HIDE SUGA, at the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly, on host­ing the Games that were post­poned from this year due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>be­tween the two coun­tries’ lead­ers amid sim­mer­ing ten­sion over the legacy of Ja­pan’s colo­nial rule of Korea. Mr Suga told Mr Moon the re­la­tion­ship was in a dif­fi­cult state, but that it could not be ne­glected and that the two na­tions should work to­gether on North Korea.</p>
