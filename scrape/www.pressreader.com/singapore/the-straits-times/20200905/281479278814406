    <p>Pub­lic trans­port fares will not be ad­justed this year to help com­muters amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil (PTC) said yes­ter­day that it will in­stead carry over the max­i­mum al­low­able rate of in­crease of 4.4 per cent un­der this year’s for­mula for con­sid­er­a­tion in next year’s re­view, but a dras­tic in­crease is un­likely in 2021, es­pe­cially if cur­rent eco­nomic con­di­tions per­sist.</p>
    <p>Rail op­er­a­tors SBS Tran­sit and SMRT Trains had ap­plied for a 4.4 per cent fare ad­just­ment, cit­ing mount­ing op­er­at­ing ex­pen­di­tures.</p>
    <p>As their rev­enues have also been hit hard by Covid-19, it is ex­pected that gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies for op­er­a­tors will be higher this year.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­port fares will not rise this year amid the Covid-19 pan­demic de­spite trans­port op­er­a­tors re­port­ing mount­ing losses.</p>
    <p>Un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances, fares could have in­creased by up to 4.4 per cent based on the cur­rent fare re­view ex­er­cise for­mula.</p>
    <p>But the Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil (PTC), in its an­nual fare re­vi­sion an­nounce­ment yes­ter­day, in­stead de­cided to carry the in­crease over to the ex­er­cise next year. This means that the max­i­mum al­low­able fare ad­just­ment next year will be this year’s 4.4 per cent plus next year’s max­i­mum al­low­able fig­ure.</p>
    <p>The PTC, how­ever, as­sured that there is un­likely to be a dras­tic in­crease in fares next year, es­pe­cially if cur­rent eco­nomic con­di­tions per­sist. PTC chair­man Richard Mag­nus said: “The coun­cil recog­nises the ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances faced by Sin­ga­pore­ans, and has con­sid­ered the im­pact on pub­lic trans­port com­muters.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic would likely lead to a fall in the core con­sumer price in­dex, wage in­dex and en­ergy in­dex – all fac­tors that make up the fare ad­just­ment for­mula, he said.</p>
    <p>“I doubt very much that we will see a fare in­crease... a po­si­tion not un­like this cur­rent year’s po­si­tion,” said Mr Mag­nus.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­port fares rose by 7 per cent last year – the max­i­mum al­lowed un­der the for­mula for 2019. The fig­ure was the big­gest per­cent­age jump since 1998, mak­ing this year’s de­ci­sion all the more marked.</p>
    <p>The rec­om­men­da­tion to not raise fares this year – ac­cepted by the Gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day – comes as pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors con­tin­ued to haem­or­rhage rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Train op­er­a­tors SMRT Trains and SBS Tran­sit had both ap­plied for a fare in­crease of 4.4 per cent, with both reg­is­ter­ing more than $10 mil­lion each in losses in their last fi­nan­cial year even with­out tak­ing into ac­count the full im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic. On bus op­er­a­tions, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day that as of July, all 356 pub­lic bus ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore are un­able to gen­er­ate enough fare rev­enue to cover their op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong also said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that while fare rev­enue will fall very short of op­er­at­ing costs this year, “the PTC took a bold but right step” by freez­ing the fares.</p>
    <p>Fall­ing rid­er­ship has not been matched by a re­duc­tion in train and bus fre­quen­cies. Pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship fell by around 75 per cent dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from</p>
    <p>April to June, but ser­vices were largely main­tained at pre-Covid-19 lev­els to al­low com­muters to travel safely and smoothly. Ex­tra funds were also spent on step­ping up clean­ing regimes amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>To­day, rid­er­ship re­mains at about 60 per cent of pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>PTC said: “With the im­pact of Covid-19, rev­enues have fallen fur­ther, and we expect gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies to be even higher this year.”</p>
    <p>It did not say how much more money the Gov­ern­ment will have to fork out to keep the op­er­a­tors afloat.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment was ex­pected to spend close to $1 bil­lion to re­new and up­grade rail op­er­at­ing as­sets, and an­other $1 bil­lion to sub­sidise pub­lic bus ser­vices an­nu­ally over the next five years. This trans­lated to more than $1 in sub­si­dies for ev­ery jour­ney taken.</p>
    <p>Mr Mag­nus said the dif­fer­ence be­tween op­er­at­ing cost and fare rev­enue was one of the rea­sons the coun­cil con­sid­ered but even­tu­ally did not rec­om­mend a fare de­crease.</p>
    <p>The con­tin­u­a­tion of the con­ces­sion schemes, the pub­lic trans­port vouch­ers and the fact that the Gov­ern­ment has pro­vided fi­nan­cial sup­port for Sin­ga­pore­ans through var­i­ous sup­port mea­sures in the Bud­gets also led to its belief that not ad­just­ing fares struck the best bal­ance.</p>
    <p>Mr Mag­nus said: “Our pri­or­ity will be to safe­guard com­muters’ in­ter­ests, while en­sur­ing a fi­nan­cially sus­tain­able pub­lic trans­port sys­tem that con­tin­ues to meet the needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans in the years to come.”</p>
    <p>STRIK­ING A BAL­ANCE Our pri­or­ity will be to safe­guard com­muters’ in­ter­ests, while en­sur­ing a fi­nan­cially sus­tain­able pub­lic trans­port sys­tem that con­tin­ues to meet the needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans in the years ’’ to come. MR RICHARD MAG­NUS, chair­man of the Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil.</p>
