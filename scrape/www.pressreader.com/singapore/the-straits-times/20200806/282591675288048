    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • A funny thing hap­pened to Amer­i­can di­rec­tors Steven Soder­bergh and Amy Seimetz in lock­down, as two of their movies found new res­o­nance dur­ing the Covid-19 era.</p>
    <p>Con­ta­gion, Soder­bergh’s 2011 pan­demic thriller star­ring Matt Da­mon, rock­eted up the i Tunes rental charts in March.</p>
    <p>Seimetz’s new film She Dies To­mor­row, which came out last Fri­day in drive-ins and this week on dig­i­tal, of­fers a more sub­jec­tive take on go­ing vi­ral. An anx­ious young woman is con­vinced she will die the next day, and any­one she tells is soon gripped by the same fear­ful prophecy.</p>
    <p>“Con­ta­gion is re­lent­lessly ob­jec­tive in its style and its for­mal struc­ture whereas Amy’s film, by de­sign, is this sort of fever dream in both its style and its sto­ry­telling,” Soder­bergh said re­cently dur­ing a pan­demic-fo­cused Zoom call with Seimetz.</p>
    <p>These are edited ex­cerpts from the con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>What were the first few months of lock­down like for both of you?</p>
    <p>Soder­bergh: I knew i n Jan­uary from talk­ing to my friends in the world of epi­demi­ol­ogy that this was se­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>I would call them and say, “So what do you think?”, and their en­tire quote was: “It’s go­ing to be bad.”</p>
    <p>But you’re try­ing to bal­ance these very con­flict­ing, pri­mal re­ac­tions to what’s hap­pen­ing with the virus and your own ca­reer ad­vance­ment, so it’s a re­ally strange col­li­sion of your civic duty and your ego.</p>
    <p>Seimetz: An­other thing that’s evolved is my con­ver­sa­tions with ex­ec­u­tives. At the be­gin­ning of this, they were, like, “We’re not in the of­fice any­more, so we’re just go­ing to call you all the time and ask when things will be ready.”</p>
    <p>It’s been in­ter­est­ing to see how those calls all dropped off in si­lence, which I pre­fer be­cause it al­lows me to do the work.</p>
    <p>What did you make of all the peo­ple who were drawn to Con­ta­gion dur­ing the early days of the pan­demic?</p>
    <p>Soder­bergh: It does pose a larger ques­tion about why we’ve had this at­trac­tion to dis­as­ter movies.</p>
    <p>Why is this kind of im­agery, this spec­ta­cle of de­struc­tion, so com­pelling to us? Is it pure fan­tasy or is it some­thing darker that’s wound into us? Seimetz: I have a the­ory about that be­cause I ac­tu­ally wit­nessed my­self do­ing this.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic started, in or­der to not feel anx­ious, I was binge­watch­ing com­pletely mind­less cr** like Too Hot To Han­dle and Love Is Blind and I was, like, “Why do I feel so ill af­ter? I’m just try­ing to take my mind off things”.</p>
    <p>And then I was, like, “I’ll watch Af­ter Life, with Ricky Ger­vais”, and I was just sob­bing the en­tire time, but I felt so much bet­ter.</p>
    <p>I needed to feel those emo­tions, like loss, sad­ness and fear. I think sup­press­ing them sort of makes you more anx­ious, so there’s a cathar­tic el­e­ment to watch­ing some­thing like Con­ta­gion, which I found strangely com­fort­ing.</p>
    <p>Is there any­thing hap­pen­ing now that you did not fore­see when mak­ing the film?</p>
    <p>Soder­bergh: What I couldn’t have pre­dicted was the frac­tur­ing of so­ci­ety that it would gen­er­ate, and all of the things it would ex­pose when the tide goes out, so to speak.</p>
    <p>I didn’t an­tic­i­pate that it would re­veal so starkly the sort of eco­nomic dis­par­ity we’re aware of in­tel­lec­tu­ally, but that a lot of us are able to in­su­late our­selves from be­ing di­rectly af­fected by. Now, no­body es­capes this. There are very few peo­ple whose lives will not be com­pletely al­tered by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Amy’s film is more about that psy­cho­log­i­cal toll and how quickly anx­i­ety can be­come con­ta­gious it­self.</p>
    <p>Seimetz: The tricky thing about anx­i­ety is shar­ing that you have it can make other peo­ple anx­ious, and there’s a feel­ing that you’re bur­den­ing them by do­ing so.</p>
    <p>Your anx­i­ety then be­comes their anx­i­ety, in a way that’s very lit­eral in this movie.</p>
    <p>It’s hap­pened with the news cy­cle too. I found my­self be­com­ing com­pletely ad­dicted to the news, get­ting anx­ious from it and then com­pul­sively watch­ing it more. So it’s also about news cy­cles spread­ing panic and the ad­dic­tion to panic.</p>
    <p>Steven, you are head­ing a Di­rec­tors Guild com­mit­tee to fig­ure out how to get Hol­ly­wood back to work safely. What are the prob­lems you are fac­ing?</p>
    <p>Soder­bergh: I think the big­gest is­sue now is be­cause of the resur­gence (of the virus), how do we get ac­cess to the re­sources and the per­son­nel we need to run these pro­to­cols to keep a set safe?</p>
    <p>It’s one thing to do one or two projects and see how it goes, but there’s a move­ment in the last two or three weeks to get lots of pro­duc­tions back up and run­ning at the same time. That’s go­ing to be tricky.</p>
