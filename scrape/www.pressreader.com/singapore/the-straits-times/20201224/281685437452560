    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo yes­ter­day ap­pointed Dr Dante Saksono Harbuwono to a new post of deputy health min­is­ter in a Cab­i­net reshuf­fle to bet­ter tackle the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Although Indonesia could do with the strong man­age­rial skills of newly as­signed Health Min­is­ter Budi Gu­nadi Sadikin to lead the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme early next year, his ap­point­ment has sparked wor­ries as he does not pos­sess med­i­cal qual­i­fi­ca­tions like his pre­de­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>How­ever, those doubts might be eased by the ap­point­ment of Dr Dante – a 47-year-old en­docri­nol­o­gist who has a doc­tor­ate in molec­u­lar di­a­betes – to as­sist the for­mer banker and cor­po­rate hon­cho.</p>
    <p>In a post-in­au­gu­ra­tion state­ment, Dr Dante said that one of his tasks, as re­quested by the Pres­i­dent, would be to ac­cel­er­ate the dis­burse­ment of health ex­pen­di­ture “ef­fec­tively and ef­fi­ciently” to over­come the Covid-19 pan­demic promptly.</p>
    <p>An­other task would be to ex­e­cute the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“It is very im­por­tant to pri­ori­tise the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the vac­ci­na­tion be­cause by do­ing that as quickly as pos­si­ble, we will at­tain bet­ter herd im­mu­nity,” he said, adding that syn­ergy with rel­e­vant in­sti­tu­tions would be key to per­form­ing the tasks.</p>
    <p>Indonesia, the world’s fourth­most pop­u­lous na­tion of 270 mil­lion peo­ple, is South-east Asia’s worst-hit coun­try in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Front-line work­ers will get pri­or­ity for the vac­cine, fol­lowed by work­ers aged 18 to 59, who are con­sid­ered the most at risk of ex­po­sure to the virus as they go to work.</p>
    <p>It has tar­geted 246 mil­lion doses to cover 107 mil­lion peo­ple, or 67 per cent of the tar­get group, rep­re­sent­ing nearly 40 per cent of its to­tal pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The coun­try wel­comed the first batch of Covid-19 vac­cines to­talling 1.2 mil­lion doses from China’s Si­no­vac Biotech on Dec 6 and ex­pects more to ar­rive early next year.</p>
    <p>Dr Dante was among 11 Cab­i­net mem­bers – six min­is­ters and five deputies – in­au­gu­rated at the pres­i­den­tial palace by Mr Joko, bet­ter known as Jokowi, in Jakarta yes­ter­day. The six min­is­ters were Mr Budi; So­cial Af­fairs Min­is­ter Tri Ris­ma­harini; Tourism and Cre­ative Econ­omy Min­is­ter San­di­aga Uno; Trade Min­is­ter Muham­mad Lutfi; Mar­itime Af­fairs and Fish­eries Min­is­ter Sakti Wahyu Treng­gono; and Re­li­gious Af­fairs Min­is­ter Yaqut Cho­lil Qoumas.</p>
    <p>Three new deputy min­is­te­rial posts in the Health Min­istry, Law and Hu­man Rights Min­istry, and Agri­cul­ture Min­istry were filled by Dr Dante, crim­i­nal law ex­pert Ed­ward Omar Sharif Hiariej, and the trea­surer of Indonesia’s largest Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tion Nahd­latul Ulama, Mr Har­vick Has­nul Qolbi, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary chief of staff Muham­mad Herindra re­placed Mr Sakti as deputy de­fence min­is­ter, while Mr Pa­hala Nu­graha Mansury, pres­i­dent di­rec­tor of state lender Bank Tabun­gan Ne­gara, filled the deputy min­is­ter for state-owned en­ter­prises post left by Mr Budi.</p>
    <p>Apart from the Cab­i­net mem­bers, the Pres­i­dent also in­stalled In­spec­tor-Gen­eral of Po­lice Petrus Rein­hard Golose as Na­tional Nar­cotics Agency chief, and for­mer en­vi­ron­ment and forestry of­fi­cial Hartono Prawiraat­maja as Na­tional Peat­land and Man­grove Restora­tion Agency chief.</p>
    <p>The shake-up of the 34-mem­ber Cab­i­net comes at a time when Indonesia is strug­gling to con­tain the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, the virus had killed 20,408 peo­ple and in­fected 685,639. Many hos­pi­tals are nearly full, while med­i­cal work­ers are suf­fer­ing from re­sponse fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>The pro­longed health cri­sis has sunk South-east Asia’s top econ­omy into its first re­ces­sion since the 1998 fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Civil so­ci­ety groups had ear­lier de­manded the re­moval of health min­is­ter Ter­awan Agus Pu­tranto, a for­mer army doc­tor who ini­tially down­played the sever­ity of the virus out­break and was later widely per­ceived as mis­han­dling it.</p>
    <p>HERD IM­MU­NITY GOAL It is very im­por­tant to pri­ori­tise the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the vac­ci­na­tion be­cause by do­ing that as quickly as pos­si­ble, we will at­tain bet­ter herd im­mu­nity. DR DANTE SAKSONO HARBUWONO, who has been ap­pointed deputy health min­is­ter, on ex­e­cut­ing the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme.</p>
