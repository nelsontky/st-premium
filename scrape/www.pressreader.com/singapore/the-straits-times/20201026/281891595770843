    <p>KABUL • Afghan forces have killed a top Al-Qaeda mil­i­tant wanted by the United States, as the gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day ac­cused the Tale­ban of still keep­ing close ties with the Is­lamist mil­i­tant group.</p>
    <p>Abu Muhsin Al-Masri, an Egyp­tian na­tional be­lieved to be the group’s No. 2 on the In­dian sub­con­ti­nent, was tar­geted in east­ern Ghazni prov­ince, Afghanista­n’s in­tel­li­gence agency said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Direc­torate of Se­cu­rity did not pro­vide fur­ther de­tails about the op­er­a­tion or when it was car­ried out.</p>
    <p>“The killing of one of the key al-Qaeda mem­bers, Al-Masri, by the Na­tional Direc­torate of Se­cu­rity demon­strates close ties of the Tale­ban with the ter­ror­ist groups that are op­er­at­ing against the Afghan gov­ern­ment and its peo­ple,” Afghanista­n’s In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ma­soud An­darabi tweeted, with­out pro­vid­ing de­tails. “They still keep close re­la­tions with the ter­ror­ist groups and they are ly­ing to dif­fer­ent sides.”</p>
    <p>The head of the US Na­tional Counter-Ter­ror­ism Cen­tre, Mr Chris Miller, con­firmed Masri’s death in a state­ment, say­ing his “re­moval... from the bat­tle­field is a ma­jor set­back to a ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion that is con­sis­tently ex­pe­ri­enc­ing strate­gic losses fa­cil­i­tated by the United States and its part­ners”.</p>
    <p>The Tale­ban’s shel­ter­ing of Al-Qaeda was the orig­i­nal rea­son for the US in­va­sion of Afghanista­n af­ter the Sept 11, 2001 at­tacks.</p>
    <p>In a land­mark deal with the US in Fe­bru­ary, the Tale­ban agreed to not al­low Afghan soil to be used by for­eign ex­trem­ists, in­clud­ing Al-Qaeda, in re­turn for Wash­ing­ton with­draw­ing its troops from the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Masri, who also goes by the name Husam Abd-al-Ra’uf, is on the FBI’s Most Wanted Ter­ror­ists list. A US war­rant for his ar­rest was is­sued in De­cem­ber 2018 af­ter he was charged with pro­vid­ing sup­port and re­sources to a for­eign ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion and plot­ting to kill US na­tion­als, ac­cord­ing to the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the death toll from a bomb blast claimed by the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria group at a higher ed­u­ca­tion cen­tre in Kabul rose to 24 yes­ter­day – most of them stu­dents.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior Min­istry spokesman Tariq Arian said an­other 57 peo­ple had been wounded in Satur­day’s at­tack in a western district of the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sion hap­pened when about 800 stu­dents were study­ing at the cen­tre, said Baqir Rahimi, who sur­vived the in­ci­dent.</p>
