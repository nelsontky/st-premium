    <p>MULAN (PG13) 115 min­utes, opens to­day</p>
    <p>The story: The spir­ited Mulan (Liu Yifei) is a girl who grows up do­ing things boys like to do, such as climb­ing and prac­tis­ing gongfu, to the dis­may of her par­ents (Tzi Ma and Ros­alind Chao). Af­ter raiders led by Bori Khan (Ja­son Scott Lee) and his witch ally Xian Lang (Gong Li) lay waste to sev­eral cities, the Em­peror (Jet Li) is­sues a con­scrip­tion or­der for the men in the king­dom. Mulan sneaks away in mil­i­tary garb, pass­ing as a man, to take her fa­ther’s place in the army. A live-ac­tion adap­ta­tion of the 1998 an­i­mated fea­ture, which is based on Chi­nese le­gends.</p>
    <p>When Dis­ney pulls a piece from its an­i­ma­tion li­brary for a live-ac­tion fresh­en­ing up, it ob­serves a few rules: jet­ti­son the mu­si­cal num­bers; erase the slap­stick; delete the racism and lastly, give the grownups some­thing to chew on.</p>
    <p>This movie proves – not for the first time – that sub­trac­tion is easy.</p>
    <p>What is harder is to fill the void with con­tent both kids and grownups will en­joy, es­pe­cially if steer­ing clear of a cul­tural faux pas is high on the pri­or­ity list.</p>
    <p>With this film, Dis­ney has de­cided to play it safe. The theme of fe­male em­pow­er­ment, sim­i­lar to the one that drives 2019’s Aladdin, drives this movie as well. But while the tale set in the Mid­dle East soars, the one in an­cient China sinks.</p>
    <p>The 2020 Mulan adap­ta­tion suf­fers from the prob­lem that also plagued 2019’s Dumbo (based on the 1941 chil­dren’s clas­sic), an up­date that felt more like a mum­mi­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>For starters, a choice was made to have ev­ery­one speak English in a sim­pli­fied, non-id­iomatic man­ner. This is an odd de­ci­sion be­cause if you want char­ac­ters in an­cient China to speak English, you might as well go all in, and have them use the lan­guage as nat­u­rally and freely as Aladdin’s char­ac­ters do.</p>
    <p>The next sin is over-Sini­cis­ing the ex­po­si­tion. It is the ver­bal equiv­a­lent of crowd­ing a set with “Ori­en­tal” lanterns and cal­li­graphic scrolls while an ex­tra in a top-knot slurps noo­dles from a bowl.</p>
    <p>Here, it hap­pens with “qi”, men­tioned with dis­may­ing fre­quency as an ex­pla­na­tion for Mulan’s un­fem­i­nine ways. If a word-cloud were to be made from the di­a­logue, “qi” and “fam­ily hon­our” would fight for top place.</p>
    <p>But the worst ex­am­ple of over­do­ing the grav­i­tas must be the phrase “Loyal, brave, true”, ut­tered an ex­cru­ci­at­ing num­ber of times and now the ti­tle of the of­fi­cial song per­formed by Christina Aguil­era. Putting aside how it is what’s known as “tat­too Chi­nese” – the clunky, Google-trans­lated text favoured by those seek­ing eth­nic ink on their bod­ies – it is a mantra that sounds pro­found at first but mean­ing­less if one takes five min­utes to think it over.</p>
    <p>The ac­tors, es­pe­cially Liu as the ti­tle char­ac­ter and Lee as the vil­lain Bori Khan, do a fine job.</p>
    <p>A new char­ac­ter, Gong Li’s witch Xian Lang is an in­ter­est­ing new char­ac­ter who de­serves a bet­ter story arc than the one given in the film.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Niki Caro, to her credit, is adept at play­ing with shades of melan­choly – there are a cou­ple of tear­jerk­ing mo­ments here – but she was handed a tough job.</p>
