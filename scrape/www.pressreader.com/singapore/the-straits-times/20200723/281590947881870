    <p>Wheel­chair user Kis­hon Chong has been reg­u­larly pos­ing as a com­muter on Tower Tran­sit pub­lic buses since last month – as part of his job. Dur­ing such trips, the 28-year-old cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence and in­clu­siv­ity of­fi­cer, who is paral­ysed from the waist down, acts as a “mys­tery shop­per” of sorts.</p>
    <p>Wheel­chair user Kis­hon Chong has been reg­u­larly pos­ing as a com­muter on Tower Tran­sit pub­lic buses since last month – as part of his job. Dur­ing such trips, the 28-year-old cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence and in­clu­siv­ity of­fi­cer, who is paral­ysed from the waist down, acts as a “mys­tery shop­per” of sorts.</p>
    <p>He poses as a reg­u­lar pas­sen­ger and as­sesses how bus driv­ers in­ter­act with him. He then gives feed­back to Tower Tran­sit train­ers on how driv­ers can be guided to bet­ter help peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He does this al­most ev­ery other day for a to­tal of 32 trips a month.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that, he also speaks to com­muters at the Jurong East bus in­ter­change to get their feed­back on pub­lic trans­port is­sues.</p>
    <p>He is the first per­son hired by a pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tor in such a role, in a move that the Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil has called “his­toric”.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong said: “I will ba­si­cally look at... the things they say, the tone they use, whether the tech­niques they ap­ply are in line with their train­ing.</p>
    <p>“There are a few times when it is not as ideal, but we will bring it up and work with the in­di­vid­ual de­part­ments to ad­vise the bus cap­tains to build a higher level of em­pa­thy.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a driver might show frus­tra­tion in his tone while low­er­ing the ramp for a wheel­chair user to board the bus. This could de­ter the com­muter from tak­ing buses.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong said: “The big­gest hur­dle for a per­son with dis­abil­i­ties is self-con­fi­dence, with con­cerns about what peo­ple think, and whether they are hold­ing up the line.</p>
    <p>“If the bus cap­tains are proac­tive and wel­com­ing, they can elim­i­nate a lot of th­ese con­cerns.”</p>
    <p>He said help­ing driv­ers un­der­stand what goes through a com­muter’s mind can help shape a cul­tural change that com­ple­ments in­fra­struc­ture im­prove­ments.</p>
    <p>He ap­plied for the role in endApril after his job coach at so­cial ser­vice agency SPD saw an ad­ver­tise­ment for the post. The job sounded in­ter­est­ing to him, as it would let him help oth­ers with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It would also be his first job after he suf­fered a stroke in the spinal cord in April 2018 that led him to lose the use of his legs. He was for­merly a chef spe­cial­is­ing in mod­ern</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean cui­sine at a restau­rant.</p>
    <p>“I was just pre­par­ing for work one day, and then sud­denly, dur­ing a half-hour pe­riod, I lost strength in my legs.” He has been un­der­go­ing phys­io­ther­apy for the past two years.</p>
    <p>Tower Tran­sit manag­ing di­rec­tor Win­ston Toh said that be­yond im­prov­ing ac­ces­si­bil­ity for com­muters, Mr Chong’s role also en­ables the firm to be more sen­si­tive to things it might have over­looked.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Mag­nus, chair­man of the Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil, said: “This is a his­toric change.</p>
    <p>“With the sup­port of our pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors, we can con­tinue to trans­form Sin­ga­pore’s pub­lic trans­port sys­tem into a more car­ing, wel­com­ing and in­clu­sive one.”</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors SMRT, Go-Ahead Sin­ga­pore and SBS Tran­sit said they are com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing a smooth jour­ney for all com­muters, and have trained staff to prop­erly help peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>SMRT chief com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cer Margaret Teo said more than 2,000 staff have gone through ex­ten­sive in­clu­sive ser­vice train­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong also hopes to help re­verse stereo­types of peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties. In his cus­tomer ser­vice role, there have been oc­ca­sions when com­muters thought he needed help. Some have even of­fered him money.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of the stereo­type that a per­son in a wheel­chair al­ways needs the help of oth­ers, we’ve flipped that around to show that a per­son in a wheel­chair can help other com­muters,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The more peo­ple learn... the more open they will be to the idea of hav­ing more peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties in­te­grate back into so­ci­ety, without feel­ing like they are there to ask for some­thing.”</p>
    <p>He poses as a reg­u­lar pas­sen­ger and as­sesses how bus driv­ers in­ter­act with him. He then gives feed­back to Tower Tran­sit train­ers on how driv­ers can be guided to bet­ter help peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
