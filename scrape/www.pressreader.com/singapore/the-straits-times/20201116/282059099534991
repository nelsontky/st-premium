    <p>Be­fore he grad­u­ated in 2013, Mr Shah In­dra Jasni ap­plied for an in­tern­ship at La Pyra­mide in Vi­enne, France.</p>
    <p>The four-month stint at the twoMiche­lin-starred restau­rant was part of Mr In­dra’s fi­nal-year in­tern­ship re­quire­ment for the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion’s (ITE) Tech­ni­cal Di­ploma in Culi­nary Arts pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Mr In­dra, who is now 28, said: “It was dif­fi­cult to be there alone. I could speak a lit­tle French, enough to do my job and move around, but it was tough to ad­just to the restau­rant en­vi­ron­ment there. It was dif­fer­ent from school back home.”</p>
    <p>But the ex­pe­ri­ence taught him a great deal.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Mr In­dra started a business with two friends sell­ing ha­lal burg­ers at Golden Mile Food</p>
    <p>Cen­tre. Burgs by Project Warung has ex­panded to four out­lets, al­though the orig­i­nal Golden Mile hawker stall has since closed.</p>
    <p>Last month, Mr In­dra opened a new stall in Bukit Merah called Bird­haus by Project Warung, sell­ing fried chicken.</p>
    <p>He said that across his dif­fer­ent stalls, daily sales hit about four fig­ures per out­let.</p>
    <p>He was among the first to be en­rolled in the tech­ni­cal di­ploma pro­gramme, which started in 2011 and has pro­duced a num­ber of chefs and business own­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr In­dra, who was one of four stu­dents in his batch to be of­fered an in­tern­ship post­ing in France, chose La Pyra­mide be­cause it pro­vided free lodg­ing and meals.</p>
    <p>He se­cured the po­si­tion with the help of a chef in Saint Pierre restau­rant in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr In­dra had pre­vi­ously in­terned there while pur­su­ing a Nitec in West­ern Culi­nary Arts.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents in the ITE tech­ni­cal di­ploma pro­gramme take French lan­guage lessons and learn about French his­tory and cul­ture.</p>
    <p>They also study restau­rant man­age­ment and ac­count­ing, among other things.</p>
    <p>Said Mr In­dra: “What I’m do­ing now (run­ning my own hawker stall) is very dif­fer­ent from what I learnt in school or in my in­tern­ship days.</p>
    <p>“But my time in ITE helped me tackle prob­lems and be for­ward­think­ing – these were skills that our lec­tur­ers tried to im­part to us.”</p>
    <p>He added that he is in talks to open a flag­ship cafe or restau­rant, which is his dream.</p>
