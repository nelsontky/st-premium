    <p>• Fifa plans to in­tro­duce a se­ries of mea­sures to pro­tect preg­nant foot­ballers, in­clud­ing manda­tory ma­ter­nity leave of at least 14 weeks, the sport’s world gov­ern­ing body an­nounced on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“We want to see more women play foot­ball but in the same time have a fam­ily,” Sarai Bare­man, Fifa’s chief women’s foot­ball of­fi­cer, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The body said it would put a se­ries of re­forms for­ward for ap­proval by the Fifa Coun­cil next month, mak­ing them im­me­di­ately ap­pli­ca­ble across all of its 211 mem­ber fed­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The manda­tory ma­ter­nity leave would see play­ers guar­an­teed a min­i­mum two-thirds of their con­tracted salary. Fifa also wanted to make it harder for clubs to part com­pany with preg­nant play­ers, say­ing “no fe­male player should ever suf­fer a dis­ad­van­tage as a re­sult of be­com­ing preg­nant”.</p>
    <p>It added that the new mea­sures are to “se­cure greater em­ploy­ment pro­tec­tion for women in foot­ball”.</p>
    <p>“The idea is to pro­tect fe­male play­ers be­fore, dur­ing and af­ter child birth,” said Emilio Gar­cia, Fifa’s chief le­gal and com­pli­ance of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­pos­als, if a player is laid off af­ter be­com­ing preg­nant, clubs re­spon­si­ble face fi­nan­cial as well as sport­ing pun­ish­ments.</p>
    <p>Clubs must also rein­te­grate the play­ers and pro­vide ad­e­quate med­i­cal and phys­i­cal sup­port af­ter they have given birth.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Fifa pres­i­dent Gianni In­fantino said the re­forms were nec­es­sary at a time when women’s foot­ball is grow­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “Fol­low­ing the re­cent phe­nom­e­nal growth and the un­prece­dented suc­cess of the Fifa Women’s World Cup in France last year, women’s foot­ball is now en­ter­ing its next stage of de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“It fol­lows that we also have to adopt a reg­u­la­tory frame­work that is ap­pro­pri­ate and suit­able to the needs of the women’s game.”</p>
    <p>Cases of women’s play­ers re­turn­ing to top-level com­pe­ti­tion af­ter giv­ing birth have been rare, although US World Cup-win­ning star Alex Mor­gan, 31, had a baby in May and has since signed for English club Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur.</p>
