    <p>This year marks the 70th an­niver­sary of the es­tab­lish­ment of diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween In­dia and China – an oc­ca­sion the two coun­tries had planned to mark in style with “70 cel­e­bra­tory ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>But ten­sions fol­low­ing a bloody bor­der clash in June and the pan­demic have put a span­ner in the works. In fact, the strain is now be­gin­ning to im­pact cul­tural co­op­er­a­tion, with re­ports sug­gest­ing In­dia is re­view­ing such ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>An Aug 2 re­port in The Hindu news­pa­per said the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion had told In­dian in­sti­tu­tions host­ing Con­fu­cius In­sti­tutes (CIs) that it would re­view their ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>CIs, which are funded by the Chi­nese govern­ment, are aimed at teach­ing Man­darin and pro­mot­ing Chi­nese cul­ture.</p>
    <p>The Hin­dus­tan Times also re­ported that more than 50 pacts signed be­tween In­dian and Chi­nese aca­demic in­sti­tu­tions are un­der the scan­ner.</p>
    <p>These moves come at a time when Man­darin has been dropped from a selection of sug­gested lan­guages that may be taught at In­dian schools, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion Pol­icy (NEP) 2020 re­leased on July 29. A draft ver­sion of the pol­icy had in­cluded “Chi­nese”. While this does not bar learn­ing Man­darin, ex­perts have picked up the warn­ing signs.</p>
    <p>“This is send­ing a sig­nal to China that if the bor­der re­mains hot, then it is not go­ing to be busi­ness as usual in other ar­eas, in­clud­ing the cul­tural do­main,” said Pro­fes­sor B.R. Deepak, who is chair­man of the Cen­tre for Chi­nese and South Asian Stud­ies at the Jawa­har­lal Nehru Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he added that agree­ments with Chi­nese aca­demic in­sti­tutes have been “non-starters” be­cause many In­dian uni­ver­si­ties do not have the funds and in­fra­struc­ture nec­es­sary for the CIs – like those that are re­quired to host vis­it­ing schol­ars.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting re­search visas for vis­it­ing Chi­nese schol­ars has been dif­fi­cult too.”</p>
    <p>CIs have been viewed with sus­pi­cion across the world. Last week, the</p>
    <p>United States des­ig­nated the Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute US Cen­tre a “for­eign mis­sion” of China.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre must now reg­u­larly in­form the State De­part­ment about the Chi­nese cit­i­zens it em­ploys, as well as its other op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The web­site of the Han­ban – the CI head­quar­ters in Bei­jing – lists three CIs in In­dia along with three</p>
    <p>Con­fu­cius Class­rooms, which are off­shoots of CIs.</p>
    <p>Dr Vibha Su­rana, the di­rec­tor of the CI at the Uni­ver­sity of Mum­bai, said there has been “no change” in the func­tion­ing of the in­sti­tute and re­fused to com­ment fur­ther.</p>
    <p>The other two CI host in­sti­tu­tions – the Vel­lore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy and Lovely Pro­fes­sional Uni­ver­sity – did not re­spond to queries.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese Em­bassy in New Delhi claimed on Aug 4 that all CIs were es­tab­lished by Chi­nese and In­dian uni­ver­si­ties “after sign­ing (a) le­gally bind­ing co­op­er­a­tion agree­ment... on the premise that the In­dian side ap­plied vol­un­tar­ily and met the con­di­tions for run­ning the in­sti­tute”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, In­dian Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs spokesman Anurag Srivastava said on Aug 6 that “for­eign cul­tural cen­tres” such as the CIs re­quire the prior ap­proval of the min­istry be­fore en­ter­ing into an agree­ment with an In­dian or­gan­i­sa­tion. He did not elab­o­rate on whether any of the CIs had vi­o­lated this guide­line.</p>
    <p>In­dia has al­ways been wary of CIs. A 2005 agree­ment to set up one at the Jawa­har­lal Nehru Uni­ver­sity, for in­stance, never took off be­cause of dif­fer­ences over the in­sti­tute’s pro­posed func­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Jabin T. Jacob from Shiv Nadar Uni­ver­sity told The Straits Times: “Suc­ces­sive In­dian gov­ern­ments have been much smarter and more aware of Chi­nese in­ten­tions and or­gan­i­sa­tions like the Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute than the Amer­i­cans and Euro­peans.”</p>
    <p>The US in 2018 had as many as 644 CIs or Class­rooms. This is down to 94 now, ac­cord­ing to Han­ban’s web­site. “I am not par­tic­u­larly wor­ried about these in­sti­tutes be­ing thrown out (from In­dia) be­cause we can make up for the loss with Tai­wanese teach­ers,” Prof Jacob said.</p>
    <p>The Shiv Nadar Uni­ver­sity em­ployed two Tai­wanese in­struc­tors to teach Man­darin from Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Prof Jacob hopes the ex­clu­sion of Chi­nese from the NEP does not lead to an un­rav­el­ling of the in­fra­struc­ture that has been de­vel­oped over the years to teach the lan­guage. “There is no clear-cut di­rec­tive from the govern­ment to drop Chi­nese – the lan­guage of the NEP is am­bigu­ous – but if there is, it would be as­ton­ish­ingly short-sighted,” he said.</p>
    <p>Added Prof Deepak: “Ir­re­spec­tive of whether our re­la­tion­ship with China is malev­o­lent or benev­o­lent, we will need to study China.”</p>
    <p>NOT BUSI­NESS AS USUAL</p>
    <p>This is send­ing a sig­nal to China that if the bor­der re­mains hot, then it is not go­ing to be busi­ness as usual in other ar­eas, in­clud­ing the cul­tural do­main. ’’</p>
