    <p>It would seem odd that just as China and Aus­tralia helped con­clude the Asean-led Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP), the world’s big­gest free trade agree­ment, both should now be in­volved in a diplo­matic brawl in­volv­ing doc­tored images, cross-ac­cu­sa­tions and puni­tive tar­iffs that put pres­sure on Aus­tralian ex­port in­dus­tries. The lat­est brouhaha fol­lows months of ten­sion be­tween the two, ex­ac­er­bated by the Covid-19 pan­demic that was first iden­ti­fied in China and Aus­tralia’s call for a full in­ter­na­tional in­quiry into the ori­gins of the out­break. Last month, Bei­jing pre­sented Can­berra with a list of 14 de­mands and com­plaints, in­clud­ing of un­favourable cov­er­age in Aus­tralian me­dia.</p>
    <p>At the heart of the is­sue is that the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment un­der Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son has stead­fastly stood with the Western al­liance against China, and more re­cently, strongly em­braced the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue stitched up by Ja­pan and the United States, and which also in­cludes In­dia. Can­berra has not only shut out Huawei from its pu­ta­tive 5G telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions net­work, but also sent tech­ni­cal and in­tel­li­gence ex­perts to warn off New Delhi about the al­leged risks, ad­vice that ap­pears to have fallen on will­ing ears. Bei­jing sees this as in­grat­i­tude: Aus­tralia’s three-decade run of eco­nomic growth was with­out ques­tion helped by iron ore, meat and wine ex­ports to China’s huge mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Such fric­tions are not un­usual and will re­cur in a world of strate­gic flux where de­vel­op­ments on the global chess­board can move quickly, of­ten in con­trary di­rec­tions. How­ever, it has now de­scended to lev­els that are cause for con­cern, es­pe­cially af­ter a Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman, cel­e­brated in his coun­try for his “Wolf war­rior” in­stincts, pinned on his Twit­ter feed a con­cocted im­age of an Aus­tralian sol­dier “slit­ting” the throat of an Afghan child. His su­pe­rior’s re­fusal to re­pu­di­ate the false­hood, and the re­jec­tion of calls for an apol­ogy, have added fat to the fire. Aus­tralians are in­censed. So, too, its neigh­bours. New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern in­structed her gov­ern­ment to raise the mat­ter with China. The spat over the doc­tored im­age has, in fact, over­shad­owed cred­i­ble re­ports of hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions by Aus­tralian sol­diers in Afghanista­n for over a decade. Aus­tralia needs to hold its mil­i­tary to ac­count and in­deed, Mr Mor­ri­son has ex­pressed his “deep­est sor­row” over the mat­ter to Afghan Pres­i­dent Ashraf Ghani.</p>
    <p>Beyond the im­me­di­ate spat, Bei­jing and Can­berra need to step back from the abyss they are head­ing to­wards. If Asia is where their com­mon fu­tures lie – their par­tic­i­pa­tion in RCEP un­der­scores this aware­ness – it would ben­e­fit both to lift a page or two from Asean’s play­book. Its es­sen­tial mes­sage is this: en­gage in di­a­logue, and do not al­low dif­fer­ences to de­velop into dis­putes.</p>
