    <p>I was a friend of the pi­o­neer artist, Ge­or­gette Chen. As a sup­porter of art and artists, I came to know her when she was teach­ing at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Art (Nafa). She lived alone in a small bun­ga­low in Siglap Plain. She was very in­de­pen­dent and drove around in a Mor­ris Minor.</p>
    <p>On a few oc­ca­sions, she in­vited me home for dinner and served me very de­li­cious French cui­sine, which she had learnt to cook dur­ing her stu­dent days in Paris. An ele­gant and so­phis­ti­cated lady, she was al­ways well dressed and had her hair neatly combed.</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber that around 1974, when I went to see her and asked whether she could sell to the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs two paint­ings, which were des­tined for our diplo­matic of­fices in New York and Washington, she said no. She said that her paint­ings were her chil­dren, and her chil­dren were not for sale.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, I asked whether I could adopt two of her chil­dren, promis­ing to look af­ter them well. She agreed on that con­di­tion. The two still life paint­ings are of her favourite fruit, the rambu­tan. One paint­ing is still at our Per­ma­nent Mis­sion to the United Na­tions in New York. The other has been brought back to Sin­ga­pore and is at the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore is hold­ing a ma­jor ret­ro­spec­tive of her paint­ings which I re­cently viewed. It is a beautiful, joy­ful and in­spir­ing ex­hi­bi­tion. I hope that</p>
    <p>many art-lov­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans, res­i­dents and vis­i­tors will visit the show be­fore it ends in Septem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>GE­OR­GETTE CHEN’S BACK­GROUND</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gette Chen or Chang Li Ying was born in 1906, in China. Her fa­ther was a wealthy an­tique dealer with busi­nesses in Lon­don, New York and Paris. Un­usu­ally, for Chi­nese girls of that gen­er­a­tion, Ge­or­gette went to a pri­vate school in Shang­hai. She then at­tended high school in New York and stud­ied art at two art col­leges in Paris.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult of her ed­u­ca­tion, she was flu­ent in Chi­nese, English and French. From a young age, she de­cided to be­come an artist, re­belling against the wishes of her fa­ther. Ge­or­gette achieved suc­cess at a young age. In 1930, when she was 24, one of her paint­ings was ac­cepted for ex­hi­bi­tion by the pres­ti­gious Sa­lon d’Au­tomne in Paris.</p>
    <p>Be­fore she left France in 1930, to re­turn to China, she was al­ready recog­nised as an out­stand­ing artist</p>
    <p>and her paint­ings were reg­u­larly ac­cepted by var­i­ous French sa­lon ex­hi­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>GE­OR­GETTE’S LOVE LIFE</p>
    <p>When Ge­or­gette was an art stu­dent in Paris, she met and fell in love with a man who was 12 years older than she. His name was Eugene Chen, a son of Trinidad and Tobago but a Chi­nese na­tion­al­ist.</p>
    <p>Eugene was a sup­porter of Dr Sun Yat Sen’s mis­sion to over­throw the Manchu Qing Dy­nasty and to es­tab­lish the Repub­lic of China. When Sun be­came the first pres­i­dent of the Repub­lic, Eugene served as his act­ing for­eign min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Eugene’s death in 1944 in Shang­hai, Ge­or­gette mar­ried his best friend, Ho Yung Chi, in 1947. In 1949, she de­cided to leave China, be­cause she was un­sure whether there was a place for artists in the new China.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple moved to Pe­nang in 1951. The mar­riage was an un­happy one, and ended in di­vorce.</p>
    <p>FROM NEW YORK TO PE­NANG AND SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the war and the rev­o­lu­tion in China, Ge­or­gette was poor and had to find em­ploy­ment. In 1951, a Chi­nese school in Pe­nang, Han Chi­ang High School, hired her to teach art and her hus­band to teach the Chi­nese lan­guage.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing lived all her life in tem­per­ate coun­tries, she was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the trop­ics for the first time. She loved it.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the cou­ple di­vorced, Ge­or­gette left Pe­nang in 1953 to teach at Nafa in Sin­ga­pore. And, as they say, the rest is his­tory. She loved Sin­ga­pore and Nafa.</p>
    <p>To as­sim­i­late, she learnt to speak Malay and she de­vel­oped a spe­cial affin­ity for the Malay com­mu­nity. There are many paint­ings of Malays in the ex­hi­bi­tion. Ge­or­gette, the daugh­ter of the Chi­nese,</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can and French civil­i­sa­tions, be­came a Sin­ga­porean and em­braced our mul­ti­cul­tur­al­ism. Des­tiny had brought her to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>GE­OR­GETTE’S ART</p>
    <p>Be­cause of her train­ing in Paris, Ge­or­gette’s artis­tic style was very much in­flu­enced by the French Im­pres­sion­ists. Her brush strokes and the vi­brant colours are very Im­pres­sion­ist.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she de­vel­oped her own dis­tinc­tive style. Her paint­ings, whether land­scape, still life or por­trait, are recog­nis­ably works by Ge­or­gette Chen. A good artist suc­ceeds in in­ject­ing her per­son­al­ity and spirit into all her cre­ations.</p>
    <p>Her paint­ings show us that she re­spected peo­ple of all races and so­cial class. Her strik­ing por­traits are of or­di­nary peo­ple. She loved the colours, peo­ple, cul­ture, flora and fauna of Malaya and Sin­ga­pore. No one has painted our hum­ble fruit with so much love and beauty.</p>
    <p>MY FAVOURITE PAINT­INGS</p>
    <p>There are so many beautiful and out­stand­ing paint­ings in the ex­hi­bi­tion that it is al­most im­pos­si­ble to pick my three</p>
    <p>favourites. For por­traits, my favourite is Sa­tay Boy, shown grilling sa­tay by a beach for a mother and her son. This paint­ing is spe­cial be­cause it com­bines por­trai­ture with land­scape.</p>
    <p>My favourite land­scape is Lo­tus Sym­phony, her paint­ing of lo­tus flow­ers dancing in the breeze. My favourite still life is her large beautiful paint­ing of trop­i­cal fruit, in­clud­ing her favourite, the rambu­tan.</p>
    <p>GE­OR­GETTE’S FRIENDS</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gette had many friends. One of her old­est friends was Soong Ching Ling, who was mar­ried to Sun. Ge­or­gette ad­dressed her by her Chris­tian name, Rosamund. Ge­or­gette also be­friended Malaysia’s first prime min­is­ter, Tengku Ab­dul Rah­man, who was one of her pa­trons and of­fi­ci­ated at the open­ing of her ex­hi­bi­tion in Kuala Lumpur in 1956.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, she be­came a good friend of Lee Seng Gee, the then chair­man of the Lee Foun­da­tion, Sin­ga­pore’s largest pri­vate char­i­ta­ble foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, not all her friends were fa­mous peo­ple. One of her best friends was Ro­hani Is­mail, one of her stu­dents at Nafa.</p>
    <p>She had a knack for mak­ing friends, and had many friends, of all races and so­cial classes.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gette was a world-class artist in search of a home. She could have set­tled in Paris or New York, where she had stud­ied. To our great for­tune, she chose Sin­ga­pore as her home.</p>
    <p>She taught many of our sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion artists.</p>
    <p>She was the only woman in the ex­alted group of pi­o­neer artists, con­sist­ing of Cheong Soo Pieng, Chen Wen Hsi, Liu Kang and</p>
    <p>Chen Chong Swee.</p>
    <p>When she died in 1993, at the age of 86, she left us a very rich and beautiful legacy.</p>
