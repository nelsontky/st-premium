    <p>A for­mer muay thai in­struc­tor, who was sen­tenced to seven years and four months’ jail plus four strokes of the cane for sex­u­ally as­sault­ing a woman while mas­sag­ing her thigh, lost his ap­peal on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Tan Wai Luen, who had ap­pealed against his con­vic­tion and sen­tence on a charge of sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion, was granted a three-week de­fer­ment to set­tle his per­sonal af­fairs be­fore start­ing his jail term.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, a district judge found Tan, 31, guilty of sex­u­ally vi­o­lat­ing the 33-year-old woman who at­tended a free trial class at his gym on Oct 1, 2016.</p>
    <p>The woman tes­ti­fied that af­ter the class ended, Tan of­fered her a free Thai mas­sage, which she ac­cepted. Dur­ing the mas­sage, he in­serted his fin­ger into her, she said. She added that he stopped af­ter she shouted at him but con­tin­ued with the mas­sage for about 10 to 15 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The next day, she told the co­founder of the gym about her or</p>
    <p>deal and the lat­ter lodged a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>In dis­miss­ing the ap­peal, High Court judge See Kee Oon noted that Tan gave three “dis­tinctly in­con­sis­tent” de­fences in court and was not a cred­i­ble wit­ness.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, dur­ing his trial, Tan claimed that he could have ac­ci­den­tally vi­o­lated the woman.</p>
    <p>His lawyer sug­gested that the pen­e­tra­tion may have been an “ac­ci­dent” be­cause the woman’s skin was slip­pery and oily due to sweat from the ex­er­cise and the use of olive oil dur­ing the mas­sage.</p>
    <p>Later, in the trial, Tan changed his story, say­ing he could not have touched her gen­i­tal area at all, as he did not go near her in­ner thigh dur­ing the mas­sage.</p>
    <p>At his ap­peal hear­ing last Mon­day, Tan took a third po­si­tion, ar­gu­ing that it was phys­i­cally im­pos­si­ble for him to have vi­o­lated the woman in the way she de­scribed be­cause she was wear­ing un­der­wear and ly­ing face-down covered by a towel.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice See also noted that Tan ini­tially de­nied per­form­ing any mas­sage on the vic­tim when he was ques­tioned by the co-founder of the gym and the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese con­tem­po­ra­ne­ous re­ac­tions were sim­ply not con­sis­tent with his pleas of in­no­cence,” said the judge. The var­i­ous ex­pla­na­tions Tan pro­vided for ly­ing were “du­bi­ous and im­plau­si­ble”, he added.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice See also re­jected Tan’s ar­gu­ments that the woman’s ac­count was in­con­sis­tent and im­plau­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the woman ex­plained that she al­lowed Tan to con­tinue with the mas­sage even af­ter he vi­o­lated her be­cause she was con­cerned that, given her state of un­dress, he might over­power her and es­ca­late his acts should she leave abruptly.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice See said that although Tan sug­gested the woman was falsely ac­cus­ing him for some ul­te­rior pur­pose, this was not borne out by ob­jec­tive ev­i­dence; Tan himself con­ceded he could not think of any rea­son for her to do so.</p>
