        Features Life | | C3 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 30, 2020 980 518 117 SEMBAWANG INTERCHANG­E > LORONG 1 GEYLANG TERMINAL PASIR RIS INTERCHANG­E > ORCHARD PUNGGOL TEMPORARY INTERCHANG­E > SEMBAWANG INTERCHANG­E TIP: TIP: TIP: The ride takes less than 1½ hours. You can cut the travelling time down to an hour if you alight before Khatib MRT station. The loop takes more than 2½ hours – perfect if you want some time alone with your thoughts. Alternativ­ely, hop on at Bedok North MRT station or Moulmein Road. Do not forget to head to the bathroom first. Your bladder will thank you later. This route takes you through tree-lined avenues in air-conditione­d comfort – a relaxing 1½-hour ride, but you will not see many of these attraction­s without hopping off. Visit safedistpa­rks.nparks.gov.sg to check how crowded a park or nature reserve is before heading down. SIGHT ORCH
