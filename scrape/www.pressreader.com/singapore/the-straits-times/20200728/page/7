However, when this is normalised and especially when nothing happens when we resume social activities, many may tend to let their guard down. Person B’s

SOCIOLOGIS­T PAULINE STRAUGHAN • This greatly reduces the number of close contacts and risk of contractin­g the virus. PENALISE THE RECALCITRA­NT ONES If one does forget to wear a mask or abide by safe distancing regulation­s genuinely, it is important that the public and enforcers do not be too quick to castigate... But, of course, if one is clearly recalcitra­nt, then penalties and sanctions ought to apply.

Ms Lydia Lim, 24, who works in tech supply, has taken this advice to heart. She has been limiting her social interactio­ns to two to three times each week, each time keep- ing to around two to three people.
“I think the circuit breaker has helped me to rethink my social interactio­ns and prioritise the gatherings which I attend – and I think this will definitely change the way I spend my time in future,” she said. dorms, and the risk of spillover.”
Still, a cluster could happen any time and anywhere. The community cluster at the Bukit Panjang integrated transport hub, that was uncovered last Friday, is a case in point.
To protect themselves, Singaporea­ns should be prudent and maintain a limited number of contacts during this period, Prof Teo said.
He added: “However, if one of your contacts is a social butterfly and continues to maintain a very diverse social circle, then clearly your risk is still amplified.
“This is why we keep emphasisin­g that the success of keeping Covid-19 at bay depends on everyone’s cooperatio­n, to keep to the spirit of the regulation­s around social activities in order to protect the community.”

Some people may also be selectivel­y hearing only informatio­n that seems favourable to them.
Professor Paulin Straughan, a sociologis­t at the Singapore Management University, said the green light given for local tourism packages may mean that Singaporea­ns fail to heed the accompanyi­ng cautionary alerts. She said: “While it is impossible for everything to be placed at a standstill for an indefinite period of time, allowing more activities to resume may mean that people tend to focus on the green light given by the Government, momentaril­y forgetting that Singapore is still in fact in amber mode.”
“This underlines the importance on the part of enforcemen­t officers to remind the public to continue taking precaution­s like adhering to safe distancing measures,” she added. Ms Sylvia Chua, 55, who used to have staycation­s twice a year with her brother’s family and mother, is reluctant to book a local hotel this year, although the Singapore Tourism Board has been encouragin­g staycation­s.
“The rest of the world is seeing second and third waves of Covid-19. The situation is still not stable,” said the music teacher.
The Straits Times learnt that those up to 30 years old are more comfortabl­e going out, but prefer outdoor venues and shorter outings.
Ms Wendy Neo, 24, has been skipping the malls for cycling and hiking instead.
“Aside from outdoor activities, we also go to each other’s homes a lot more, which is safer and more conducive for catching up, unlike crowded areas,” said the video editor. tansuwen@sph.com.sg nshab@sph.com.sg out risk,” she added.
According to the latest available figures, Canada has so far recorded more day against the wearing of face masks, which are now compulsory in the French-speaking province.
Protesters said they believed that they should have a choice on whether to wear a mask and it should not be up to the government to mandate its use, CTV News reported.
Others expressed scepticism and cited conspiracy theories about masks and, in some cases, the Covid-19 pandemic itself.
Quebec and Ontario are the two provinces hit hardest by the virus in Canada.
In Quebec, over 58,500 people have been diagnosed with the virus while more than 5,600 have died, a Global News report said. More than 50,700 people have recovered.
The province has stepped up its testing capacity in recent days. More than 1.1 million residents have been tested for Covid-19 so far, said the report.
In Ontario, more than 38,600 have contracted the virus, with a death toll of over 2,700. than 113,900 cases of the new coronaviru­s and some 8,900 deaths.
