    <p>An au­ton­o­mous un­der­wa­ter ro­bot used to in­spect piers and ves­sels in the mar­itime sec­tor may soon be div­ing to sur­vey in­fra­struc­ture at float­ing so­lar farms here.</p>
    <p>That is one area in which Ms Grace Chia, 29, and her team from mar­itime tech start-up BeeX, be­lieve their ro­bots can be use­ful.</p>
    <p>BeeX, which was started in Oc­to­ber 2018, yes­ter­day won the fourth Smart Port Chal­lenge, or­gan­ised by Port In­no­va­tion Ecosys­tem Reimag­ined @ BLOCK71, a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and NUS En­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 187 pitches were re­ceived from start-ups around the world, from which 16 were se­lected for a six-week pro­gramme to fur­ther pur­sue their pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>A fi­nal eight were se­lected to pitch their ideas to a panel of judges at the Shaw Foun­da­tion Alumni House au­di­to­rium yes­ter­day, and BeeX took the $10,000 cash prize.</p>
    <p>Ms Chia, who is the chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder, said that us­ing au­ton­o­mous ro­bots for un­der­wa­ter op­er­a­tions can be cheaper than us­ing tra­di­tional manned ve­hi­cles, and also more ef­fi­cient and safer than us­ing divers.</p>
    <p>Each ro­bot can be pro­grammed to do spe­cific tasks, and is then left to com­plete the op­er­a­tion while be­ing re­motely mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>BeeX is also look­ing at de­ploy­ing the ro­bots to help in the pur­suit of cleaner en­ergy here.</p>
    <p>Float­ing so­lar farms, like the one be­ing built in Tengeh Reser­voir, also re­quire reg­u­lar largescale in­spec­tions, which the BeeX ro­bots are suit­able for, said Ms Chia.</p>
    <p>BeeX used to sur­vey off­shore oil and gas rigs, be­fore piv­ot­ing to­wards op­er­a­tions closer to shore.</p>
    <p>Ms Chia said the cur­rent field is more cost sen­si­tive, and the team had to relook its pric­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>“The dif­fer­ence be­tween en­ergy and mar­itime is that en­ergy has very few cus­tomers and they’re all very big, but mar­itime has a lot of cus­tomers and they are very di­verse,” she said.</p>
