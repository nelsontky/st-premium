    <p>Vivo was one of the first smart­phone mak­ers to in­tro­duce in­no­va­tive fea­tures such as the in-dis­play fin­ger­print sen­sor and the pop-up front cam­era.</p>
    <p>With its lat­est Vivo X50 Pro 5G smart­phone, the Chi­nese brand is turn­ing its at­ten­tion to cam­era shake, which leads to blurry pho­tos and videos.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing smart­phones rely on both op­ti­cal im­age sta­bil­i­sa­tion (OIS) and elec­tronic im­age sta­bil­i­sa­tion (EIS) to tackle cam­era shake. OIS is a me­chan­i­cal sys­tem that com­pen­sates for mo­tion by phys­i­cally shift­ing the cam­era on the ver­ti­cal and hor­i­zon­tal axes, while EIS uses software to crop and align in­di­vid­ual frames to en­sure steady video.</p>
    <p>Vivo’s so­lu­tion is a minia­ture gim­bal that adds a third axis of sta­bil­i­sa­tion to com­pen­sate for the for­ward and back­ward move­ment while the user is moving with the smart­phone cam­era.</p>
    <p>And it ac­tu­ally works, though the X50 Pro’s gim­bal sys­tem re­ally shines only in ex­treme cases, such as shoot­ing a video while run­ning or in a dark en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the video I shoot while run­ning is sig­nif­i­cantly less shaky than a sim­i­lar video I shoot with the Google Pixel 4 XL.</p>
    <p>To help users know when to hit the shut­ter but­ton for the most sta­bilised photo or video, Vivo has added an over­lay in the cam­era app. Dubbed gim­bal radar, it uses an an­i­mated ball to rep­re­sent the move­ment of the gim­bal. Vivo says users should try to keep this ball within the small cir­cle while cap­tur­ing the photo or video.</p>
    <p>The X50 Pro’s main cam­era uses a 48-megapixel (MP) im­age sen­sor from Sony that pro­duces 12MP pho­tos that look sharp and de­tailed in good light­ing con­di­tions. How­ever, the colour ac­cu­racy and dy­namic range of the pho­tos are not quite as good as those of the top mod­els.</p>
    <p>Low-light pho­tos and videos are de­cent, al­beit with a marked in­crease in noise. There are also some splotches on uni­form sur­faces in low-light shots.</p>
    <p>The X50 Pro also has a periscopet­ype tele­photo cam­era that of­fers up to 5x op­ti­cal zoom and 60x dig­i­tal zoom. While the 5x op­ti­cal zoom is use­ful enough, the 60x dig­i­tal zoom feels like a mar­ket­ing gim­mick as im­ages are very blurry.</p>
    <p>A 13MP bokeh cam­era that of­fers 2x op­ti­cal zoom and an ul­tra-wide 8MP cam­era com­plete the X50 Pro’s set of four rear cam­eras.</p>
    <p>At the front, Vivo has gone with a 32MP hole-punch cam­era that takes very de­cent self­ies and has a va­ri­ety of beau­ti­fy­ing op­tions.</p>
    <p>This small un­ob­tru­sive cam­era blends into the phone’s 6.56-inch Amoled screen, which is curved at the sides for a near-bezel-less look. This screen also has a 90Hz re­fresh rate that feels smooth when nav­i­gat­ing the in­ter­face or scrolling Web pages.</p>
    <p>Thanks to its Qual­comm Snap­dragon 765G chip, the X50 Pro sup­ports 5G net­works. Per­for­mance­wise, the 765G chip is a step down from the Snap­dragon 865 pro­ces­sor used by this year’s top 5G phones. But the dif­fer­ence is slight enough dur­ing nor­mal us­age that I doubt users would no­tice it with­out a side-by-side com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the slower 765G is also a rea­son for the X50 Pro’s su­perb bat­tery life. It lasted 16 hours and five min­utes in The Straits Times’ video-loop test with the screen bright­ness set to max­i­mum. This is longer than the 14 hours and 27 min­utes achieved by the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G, which uses the Snap­dragon 865.</p>
    <p>The X50 Pro could prob­a­bly pass off as a pre­mium smart­phone, es­pe­cially with its matt glass back and ex­cel­lent build qual­ity. But it lacks flag­ship niceties such as wa­ter re­sis­tance and wire­less charg­ing, while sta­ple mid-range fea­tures like the head­phone jack and ex­pand­able stor­age are also miss­ing.</p>
    <p>With a re­tail price of $1,099, the X50 Pro is clearly not a mid-range model. In fact, Vivo has a high­erend X50 Pro Plus model (un­avail­able in Sin­ga­pore) that uses the Snap­dragon 865 chip, but with­out the gim­bal sys­tem. Mean­while, the X50 ($799) has nei­ther the 865 chip nor the gim­bal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In short, if you do not see the value of the gim­bal sys­tem, the cheaper X50 may be a better op­tion for those shop­ping for a rel­a­tively in­ex­pen­sive 5G phone now.</p>
