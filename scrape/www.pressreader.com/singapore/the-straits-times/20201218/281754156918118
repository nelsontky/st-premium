    <p>PARIS • French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron be­came the lat­est head of state to test pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus yes­ter­day, forc­ing sev­eral other Euro­pean lead­ers into quar­an­tine as the con­ti­nent strug­gles with a surge in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron’s wife, Brigitte, has no symp­toms, and tested neg­a­tive on Tues­day, ac­cord­ing to the El­y­see pres­i­den­tial palace in Paris.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron was tested for Covid-19 af­ter he suf­fered the first symp­toms and will now self-iso­late for seven days, his of­fice said.</p>
    <p>The di­ag­no­sis, days be­fore Mr Macron’s 43rd birth­day, comes at a par­tic­u­larly sen­si­tive time. France is strug­gling to tame a resur­gence of the virus, with the Pres­i­dent field­ing crit­i­cism of his han­dling of the cri­sis and the eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>The French leader joins US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, who were both briefly hos­pi­talised ear­lier this year af­ter con­tract­ing the virus that has killed 1.6 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide and caused global eco­nomic havoc.</p>
    <p>With Europe now ap­proach­ing 500,000 deaths since Covid-19 first emerged a year ago, the Euro­pean Union has pledged to start vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigns across the bloc by the end of the year in a bid to curb the spread of the disease.</p>
    <p>With in­oc­u­la­tions seen as the only way to bring the global pan­demic to an end, Amer­i­can ex­perts were set to dis­cuss yes­ter­day if US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Moderna’s vac­cine should be au­tho­rised – the lat­est can­di­date to seek ap­proval af­ter the roll-out of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.</p>
    <p>“I am whole-heart­edly with you,” Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen told Mr Macron on Twit­ter. “To­gether, we will de­feat this pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Mr Macron had at­tended an EU sum­mit in Brus­sels last week and on Mon­day was present at a Paris con­fer­ence or­gan­ised by the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Span­ish Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez and Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel, who were also in Paris for the meet­ing, have en­tered self-iso­la­tion as a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>Por­tuguese Prime Min­is­ter An­to­nio Costa also went into self-iso­la­tion yes­ter­day, a day af­ter a lunch meet­ing with Mr Macron, his of­fice said.</p>
    <p>French Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex will also self-iso­late.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron’s in­fec­tion comes as Europe bat­tles to con­tain a new up­swing in in­fec­tions, with sev­eral coun­tries re­turn­ing to tough lock­downs, cur­fews and other virus re­stric­tions amid fears of an ex­plo­sion in cases af­ter the Christ­mas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The EU is to start Covid-19 in­oc­u­la­tions on Dec 27, Dr von der Leyen said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>France ex­pects to re­ceive 1.16 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer- BioNTech vac­cine by Dec 30, Mr Cas­tex said in a par­lia­men­tary de­bate.</p>
