    <p>More mea­sures to help de­velop and re­tain a core Sin­ga­porean work­force for the fi­nan­cial sec­tor were un­veiled yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>One ini­tia­tive is the Work-Study Sup­port Pro­gramme that will fund 80 per cent of in­tern­ship stipends, capped at $1,000 per month, for Sin­ga­porean un­der­grad­u­ates who serve their in­tern­ships at fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>The aim is to de­velop job-ready grad­u­ates and build a Sin­ga­porean ta­lent pipe­line for the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>It is part of the Skill­sFu­ture Work-Study De­gree Pro­gramme (WSDeg), which en­ables stu­dents to gain mean­ing­ful work ex­pe­ri­ence and ac­quire work-rel­e­vant skills.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor has been a ma­jor par­tic­i­pant of the WSDeg scheme since its in­tro­duc­tion in 2017, and the Work-Study Sup­port Pro­gramme will help scale the pro­gramme in strate­gic growth ar­eas, the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) noted at a we­bi­nar yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MAS will also ex­tend the Train­ing</p>
    <p>Al­lowance Grant for com­pa­nyspon­sored trainees by six months from Dec 31 to June 30.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional sup­port is com­ing from the In­sti­tute of Bank­ing and Fi­nance, which will ex­tend its 5 per cent ad­di­tional course fee credit to cover the same pe­riod. The scheme aims to boost job re­ten­tion through up­skilling work­ers amid chang­ing tasks and roles.</p>
    <p>The Train­ing Al­lowance Grant will keep up the train­ing mo­men­tum of in-de­mand skills, such as tech­nol­ogy, and in new growth ar­eas like green fi­nance.</p>
    <p>MAS urged em­ploy­ers to con­tinue to tap en­hanced train­ing sup­port mea­sures to equip lo­cals with skills to en­hance their em­ploy­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Pa­trick Lee, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Stan­dard Char­tered Bank in Sin­ga­pore, said the new schemes com­ple­ment its $5 mil­lion in­vest­ment to boost ta­lent de­vel­op­ment and ac­cel­er­ate dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“With sup­port­ive in­dus­try ini­tia­tives, as well as our con­tin­ued in­vest­ments and train­ing ef­forts, I am con­fi­dent this will en­cour­age more as­pir­ing bankers to step for­ward, and we can ac­cel­er­ate reskilling ef­forts,” he said in a sep­a­rate state­ment e-mailed to The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ms Su­san Cheong, DBS’ group head of ta­lent ac­qui­si­tion, said the bank has part­nered Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity to of­fer a 10-week in­tern­ship for stu­dents in NTU’s Ap­plied Wealth Man­age­ment Pro­gramme since last year.</p>
    <p>“We even­tu­ally hired 16 of these stu­dents this year,” she noted.</p>
    <p>MAS man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon said that amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, job cre­ation has moved to the front and cen­tre of MAS’ fi­nan­cial de­vel­op­ment agenda.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial sec­tor ac­counted for 13.3 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and em­ployed more than 170,000 work­ers last year. It cre­ated 22,000 net jobs be­tween 2015 and last year, with about 70 per cent of those taken up by Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>In the first half of this year, the fi­nan­cial sec­tor man­aged to create 1,900 net jobs de­spite the pan­demic, with all go­ing to lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said a con­certed effort is needed to give mid-ca­reer job seek­ers the chance to be trained for these new job roles. “Em­ploy­ers must be will­ing to take a cal­cu­lated chance to hire and train mid-ca­reer job seek­ers who have good ex­pe­ri­ence but may not have all the req­ui­site skills, but can be trained.</p>
    <p>“Like­wise, job seek­ers must be will­ing to step out of their com­fort zone, and take a stab at try­ing new roles and pick­ing up new skills.”</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said MAS has been work­ing with the pri­vate bank­ing in­dus­try for an in­dica­tive com­mit­ment of about 200 trainees over the next three years for the new WorkS­tudy Sup­port Pro­gramme, with plans to ex­pand its ef­forts to growth ar­eas such as as­set man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>He urged more fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to join these pro­grammes to help build a strong ta­lent pipe­line. “To­gether, we can trans­form Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial sec­tor work­force to be among the best glob­ally,” he said.</p>
