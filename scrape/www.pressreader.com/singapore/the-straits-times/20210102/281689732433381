    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son de­clared his plan to make Bri­tain “a science su­per­power” af­ter Brexit, as the clock ticked down to the mo­ment the coun­try fi­nally parted from the Euro­pean Union’s sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms rules on New Year’s Day.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain com­pleted its di­vorce from the EU on Jan 1, more than four years af­ter the coun­try voted for Brexit.</p>
    <p>The end of the tran­si­tion pe­riod at 11pm on Thurs­day in Lon­don launched Bri­tain on a new path on its own, free from EU laws, able to strike trade agree­ments with other coun­tries around the world, and to re­shape its econ­omy at home.</p>
    <p>In his New Year mes­sage, Mr John­son said he wants to use the new op­por­tu­ni­ties Brexit pro­vides to pi­o­neer de­vel­op­ments in bio­sciences, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and bat­tery and wind power tech­nol­ogy, and cre­ate mil­lions of high­skilled jobs.</p>
    <p>“This is an amaz­ing mo­ment for this coun­try,” Mr John­son said in a state­ment from his of­fice. “We have our free­dom in our hands and it is up to us to make the most of it.”</p>
    <p>But much re­mains un­known about what that fu­ture will look like af­ter Bri­tain’s five decades in the bloc. There are also ques­tions over how Bri­tain will choose to use its new-found in­de­pen­dence from the EU, given the threat of tar­iffs from the bloc if Bri­tain dis­torts fair con­di­tions for busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>A new trade ac­cord now gov­erns com­merce be­tween Bri­tain and the EU, but adds red tape for com­pa­nies and sig­nif­i­cantly lim­its the abil­ity of Bri­tish busi­nesses to of­fer ser­vices across the bloc.</p>
    <p>Doubts are also cast on whether Lon­don or Brus­sels will look to re­write the terms of the trade agree­ment, as the ac­cord ex­plic­itly al­lows, or if Mr John­son’s govern­ment will be able to se­cure a vi­tal agree­ment on fi­nan­cial ser­vices, a key part of the Bri­tish econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In the im­me­di­ate term, prac­ti­cal challenges abound.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s govern­ment had been brac­ing it­self for dis­rup­tion at the Bri­tain-EU bor­der this month due to com­pa­nies not be­ing ready to com­ply with new red tape. Of­fi­cials fear queues of trucks will be backed up for miles if busi­nesses do not have the right forms, cre­at­ing chaos that could dis­rupt vi­tal sup­plies of food, chem­i­cals and medicines.</p>
    <p>Dis­pelling wor­ries of a re­peat of last month’s snarl-ups as Brexit took ef­fect, scores of heavy goods ve­hi­cles early yes­ter­day passed through the Chan­nel Tunnel con­nect­ing Bri­tain and France “with­out any prob­lem”, op­er­a­tor Getlink said, adding that al­most 200 lor­ries crossed into France and left the coun­try for Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>There were im­mense bot­tle­necks of traf­fic af­ter France briefly closed the bor­der late less month when a new coro­n­avirus vari­ant was found in Bri­tain. But with all driv­ers com­ing in now tak­ing tests be­fore en­ter­ing France, the back­log was cleared just in time for the com­ple­tion of Brexit.</p>
    <p>Some 70 per cent of trade be­tween Bri­tain and the EU passes through the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. On av­er­age, 60,000 pas­sen­gers and 12,000 trucks pass through daily.</p>
    <p>In his New Year’s ad­dress to the na­tion, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron re­it­er­ated his view that Bri­tain’s de­ci­sion to leave the EU was the fruit of “a lot of lies and false prom­ises”, but added that Bri­tain would re­main “our friend and ally”.</p>
    <p>In the months ahead, Mr John­son’s govern­ment has a more press­ing emer­gency – rac­ing to roll out vac­cines fast enough to roll back the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“We know that we have a hard strug­gle still ahead of us for weeks and months, be­cause we face a new vari­ant of the dis­ease that re­quires a new vigilance,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But as the sun rises to­mor­row on 2021, we have the cer­tainty of those vac­cines, pi­o­neered in a UK that is also free to do things dif­fer­ently and, if nec­es­sary, bet­ter than our friends in the EU.”</p>
