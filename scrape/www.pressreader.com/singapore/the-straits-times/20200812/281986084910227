    <p>Char­i­ties have been forced to can­cel or post­pone their fund-rais­ing ac­tiv­i­ties due to so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures but still need to con­tinue op­er­a­tions, and their ben­e­fi­cia­ries de­pend on do­na­tions to re­ceive the help they need. Mr Jef­frey Tan, di­rec­tor of Mar­ket­ing & Ad­vo­cacy, NVPC</p>
    <p>An on­line va­ri­ety show that brought home-grown artistes and co­me­di­ans to­gether to raise funds in aid of char­i­ties not di­rectly re­lated to Covid-19 has gar­nered over $500,000 in do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Six episodes of The City of Good Show have been aired on the National Vol­un­teer and Philanthro­py Cen­tre’s (NVPC) Face­book page (@Ci­ty­ofGoodSG) since June 24 to raise funds for over 125 char­i­ties. The last episode of The City of Good Show will air tonight at 8pm.</p>
    <p>Char­i­ties that sup­port causes not di­rectly re­lated to the pan­demic, such as those sup­port­ing the Arts and Her­itage, Dis­abil­ity, So­cial Ser­vices, Com­mu­nity, as well as Chil­dren and Youth causes, have seen a plunge in do­na­tions as donors shift fo­cus to Covid-19-re­lated causes.</p>
    <p>Some char­i­ties saw a de­cline of up to 80 per cent in do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“As we all fig­ure out how to cope go­ing from a pan­demic to a re­ces­sion, let us not for­get those who have slipped through the cracks,” says Mr Jef­frey Tan, di­rec­tor of Mar­ket­ing & Ad­vo­cacy, NVPC.</p>
    <p>“Char­i­ties have been forced to can­cel or post­pone their fund-rais­ing ac­tiv­i­ties due to so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures but still need to con­tinue op­er­a­tions, and their ben­e­fi­cia­ries de­pend on do­na­tions to re­ceive the help they need,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor and co­me­dian Suhaimi Yu­sof will be the guest star in tonight’s episode, also hosted by ac­tress Se­lena Tan. The funds raised dur­ing the episode will go to char­i­ties that work with chil­dren and youth, such as REACH Com­mu­nity Ser­vices So­ci­ety and The Boys’ Brigade in Sin­ga­pore to pro­vide coun­selling ser­vices and therapy for vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Suhaimi says he is pre­par­ing for the show by talk­ing to peo­ple, mak­ing ob­ser va­tions and ask­ing funny ques­tions. “I will be think­ing up some jokes — jokes that will in­spire us to be hu­man again, to look af­ter one other and to look at things be­yond its sur­face.”</p>
    <p>For ac­tress Pam Oei, who is a fea­tured artist in tonight’s The City of Good Show, the chal­lenge is to get ev­ery­one else in her house — a dog, a nine-year-old child and a hus­band — to keep quiet for about two hours. “As I am do­ing im­pro­vi­sa­tional com­edy, I also try to have some ran­dom props on standby near me so that I can use them on the fly,” she says.</p>
    <p>In us­ing their tal­ents to help char­i­ties stay afloat, both Mr Suhaimi and Ms Oei ex­em­plify NVPC’s City of Good vi­sion — where peo­ple, or­gan­i­sa­tions and lead­ers come to­gether to give their best for oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Says Mr Tan: “Any­one can give their Time, Tal­ent, Trea­sure and Voice, and to­gether, we can build a City of Good.”</p>
