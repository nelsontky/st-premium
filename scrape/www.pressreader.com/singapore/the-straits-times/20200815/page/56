Your family may want you around to keep them company, but there could be bigger business afoot.
You can help them in a big way. Taurus (April 20 - May 20)
You have something serious to talk about. Your energy is just right for accessing and communicat­ing your feelings to others. Gemini (May 21 - June 20)
You have to deal with your finances in a new way. Seek help if you think you need it, but your mental state is perfect for such considerat­ions. Cancer (June 21 - July 22)
Your spirit double is taking all the hits for you, so you can easily make it through the most contentiou­s battles. You are a pacifist at heart. Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)
Keep a tighter rein on your emotions. You can cut loose in a few days, when the energy turns towards something that is better. Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)
Your talent for organising things and people comes in handy. Even those who resent your efficiency grudgingly admire your work. Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)
Watch out for difficulti­es at home or at work. Routines are messed up, but your energy helps you to face things as they come. Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)
Your energy is suitable for getting things done, but only if it is right for you. Fortunatel­y, it is easy for you to discern what is important. Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)
You and a friend are at odds, but it is not dire. Just let the conflict unfold and you should get to the bottom of it soon. Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)
You know what the problems are – now you just need to face them directly. When things look dark, you can still try to find good solutions. Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)
Your brain is a big asset, but sometimes, it can be a crutch. Let go of your normal decision-making process and go with the flow. C: Children; CA: Current Affairs;
