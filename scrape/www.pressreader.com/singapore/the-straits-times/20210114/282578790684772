        <p>“The whole world is in a mess,” says film-maker Jack Neo.</p>
        <p>Last year was dis­as­trous for the Sin­ga­pore film in­dus­try, cin­e­mas in­cluded. Pan­demic re­stric­tions put film crews out of work and cin­e­mas had to close, then re­open with re­duced seat­ing ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
        <p>Many Sin­ga­pore-made films due to be re­leased last year were put on hold. About five made it to cin­e­mas, in­clud­ing Golden Horse-nom­i­nated drag queen mu­si­cal Num­ber 1 and com­edy-drama Tiong Bahru So­cial Club.</p>
        <p>Af­ter a de­lay of sev­eral months, Neo’s drama-com­edy The Diam Diam Era was re­leased in Novem­ber and its fol­low-up, The Diam Diam Era Two, is due in cin­e­mas over the Chi­nese New Year pe­riod.</p>
        <p>The l ong wait gave Neo the chance to un­der­stand live-stream­ing and cre­ate new ideas for the plat­form, he tells The Straits Times.</p>
        <p>“Turn cri­sis into op­por­tu­nity,” says Neo, who is also the chief ex­ec­u­tive of the one-year-old Asia Mo­men­tum Me­dia, for which he is over­see­ing moves i nto e-com­merce and mo­bile en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
        <p>Neo, 60, says he is not suc­cumb­ing to gloom, nor are any of the other film-mak­ers who spoke to The Straits Times.</p>
        <p>Like Neo, they are bank­ing on the con­tin­ued suc­cess of Sin­ga­pore’s bat­tle against Covid-19, which they hope will al­low their films to open on the big screen, in some cases af­ter a year’s de­lay.</p>
        <p>For some, the joy is tinged with the worry that au­di­ences might have lost their taste for go­ing to the cin­ema af­ter a year with pre­cious few block­busters of the kind that pull in the pa­trons who would or­di­nar­ily not go.</p>
        <p>Juan Foo, 45, is pro­duc­ing what is billed as Sin­ga­pore’s first mon­ster movie, Cir­cle Line, due in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year af­ter its 2020 re­lease was “de­railed” by the pan­demic.</p>
        <p>“Our friends and sup­port­ers have been stoked on the film for months,” he says of the an­tic­i­pa­tion. “I am just afraid that Covid has made peo­ple numb about go­ing to the cin­ema.”</p>
        <p>His worry is shared by Wayne Peng, 56, the Tai­wanese di­rec­tor of the drama Pre­cious Is The Night, which stars Sin­ga­porean pho­tog­ra­pher and model Chuando Tan.</p>
        <p>As a film-maker, Peng says he is used to hear­ing the adage that nine out of 10 films lose money at the box of­fice and the pan­demic might have made this dis­mal statis­tic even worse.</p>
        <p>“But there is room for op­ti­mism. We hope the cin­ema business will pick up when most peo­ple are vac­ci­nated,” he says.</p>
        <p>The doc­u­men­tary An­dre And His Olive Tree, a bi­og­ra­phy of Miche­lin star-awarded chef An­dre Chi­ang, opens in Sin­ga­pore cin­e­mas this week. Its Sin­ga­porean di­rec­tor,</p>
        <p>Josiah Ng, 32, says that 2020 forced him to “think hard about other av­enues to reach au­di­ences”.</p>
        <p>Be­cause he works in cre­ative agency Tribal World­wide, he had a plat­form.</p>
        <p>“Much of my work be­came more public com­mu­ni­ca­tions-re­lated. We fo­cused on us­ing sto­ries to en­cour­age, in­spire and in­form,” he says.</p>
        <p>In stor­age for a year is the com­edy Fat Hope, di­rected by Joyce Lee. Her movie has been hit by the dou­ble blow of the pan­demic and the death of its star, Tai­wanese singer­ac­tor-host Alien Huang. Last Septem­ber, the 36-year-old died sud­denly of an aor­tic dis­sec­tion.</p>
        <p>Lee, 45, hopes the film can be re­leased just be­fore Chi­nese New Year, which falls on Feb 12.</p>
        <p>The set­backs have not dis­suaded her from a cin­ema re­lease when al­ter­na­tives such as stream­ing have grown in strength. An­dre And His Olive Tree, for ex­am­ple, has been re­leased on Net­flix in Hong Kong, be­fore its re­lease here.</p>
        <p>Lee has two rea­sons for bank­ing on a cin­ema re­lease. First, she main­tains that it is harder to re­coup costs from stream­ing as re­turns for pro­duc­ers tend to be slim­mer. Also, every film-maker hopes au­di­ences can watch their films in the best con­di­tions.</p>
        <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence in cin­e­mas is more ex­cit­ing and en­gag­ing com­pared with stream­ing,” she says.</p>
        <p>Mar­cus Lim, writer-di­rec­tor of the spy thriller The Man On The Other Side, feels the same way. De­spite cur­rent so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions, he thinks that cin­e­mas are the way to go.</p>
        <p>So while the film is be­ing dis­trib­uted via stream­ing in some coun­tries, it will get a cin­ema re­lease in Sin­ga­pore, says Lim, who is in his mid-30s.</p>
        <p>Even though it was filmed in Germany with Ger­man ac­tors speak­ing in their na­tive tongue, he con­sid­ers it a Sin­ga­pore film, as it was made with Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment and a Sin­ga­pore crew.</p>
        <p>“Since we have the ben­e­fit of many of the pro­duc­tion crew be­ing lo­cated here, I think a road­show cin­ema re­lease, with a screen­ing fol­lowed by Q&A ses­sions with the pro­duc­tion team, of­fers the best ex­pe­ri­ence to the pay­ing public,” he says.</p>
