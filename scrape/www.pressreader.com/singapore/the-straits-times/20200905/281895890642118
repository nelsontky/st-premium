    <p>PARIS • France’s ed­u­ca­tion min­is­ter yes­ter­day said 22 schools on French ter­ri­tory have had to shut due to the coro­n­avirus since pupils re­turned to school this week, em­pha­sis­ing that over half of these were in the In­dian Ocean is­land of La Re­union.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Jean-Michel Blan­quer told Europe 1 ra­dio that he was, how­ever, pleased with how the chil­dren’s re­turn to school had pro­gressed since Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“It has been a rather good week, even though there are al­ways some glitches. Over 12 mil­lion pupils re­turned to school in spite of the dif­fi­cul­ties and the wor­ries,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ten schools have closed in main­land France and 12 on La Re­union, where there has been a re­cent surge i n coro­n­avirus cases, he added. France has some 60,000 schools na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Up to 130 classes have also been halted within schools and the min­is­ter said the au­thor­i­ties were check­ing around 250 in­ci­dents re­lated to Covid-19 i n schools ev­ery day. These are mainly linked to “fac­tors out­side school con­cern­ing peo­ple who could have been con­tam­i­nated” over the summer, he said.</p>
    <p>More than three Covid-19 cases means that the school is tem­po­rar­ily shut, he said.</p>
    <p>France is cur­rently see­ing a surge in Covid-19 cases – with 7,157 new cases re­ported on Thurs­day – al­though the au­thor­i­ties have said ev­ery­thing will be done to avoid any new na­tion­wide l ock­down. The surge has wor­ried France’s farflung over­seas ter­ri­to­ries in the In­dian Ocean, Pa­cific and South Amer­ica, where health sys­tems are of­ten not as sturdy as on the main­land.</p>
    <p>In Italy, some eight mil­lion pupils are re­turn­ing to schools for the first time since March, as the coun­try re­ported for the ninth time in 13 days over 1,000 new Covid-19 cases on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Thurs­day was the first day that stu­dents be­gan re­turn­ing to school in Italy, mostly in pri­vate schools across the coun­try. Most pub­lic school stu­dents will re­turn either next Mon­day or on Sept 14.</p>
    <p>Vi­rol­o­gist An­drea Crisanti this week pre­dicted an in­fec­tion rate of 2 to 3 per cent among stu­dents, po­ten­tially re­sult­ing in as many as 240,000 new in­fec­tions or nearly as many in­fec­tions as hav­ing been recorded na­tion­ally since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
