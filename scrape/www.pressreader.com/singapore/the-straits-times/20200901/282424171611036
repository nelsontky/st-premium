    <p>CHICAGO • Dustin John­son made an “un­be­liev­able” 45-foot birdie putt on his fi­nal hole to force a play-off at the PGA Tour’s BMW Cham­pi­onship on Sun­day, only to watch Jon Rahm nail an even big­ger one on the first ex­tra hole.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard clinched the ti­tle – his sec­ond of the sea­son fol­low­ing July’s tri­umph at Me­mo­rial – with a putt from 66 feet on the same par­four 18th hole to win, leav­ing the Amer­i­can in dis­be­lief.</p>
    <p>“I was kind of laugh­ing at my putt, be­cause it was one of those where you – you’re not re­ally think­ing you’re go­ing to make it,” world No. 1 John­son said af­ter he shot a three-un­der 67 to fin­ish locked with Rahm on four-un­der 276 at Olympia Fields.</p>
    <p>“I played an un­be­liev­able putt, got in the play-off and then Jon made an even more ridicu­lous putt on top of me.”</p>
    <p>He had the chance to ex­tend the match but missed his long birdie putt, en­sur­ing sec­ond-ranked Rahm would en­ter this week’s Tour Cham­pi­onship in At­lanta sec­ond in the FedEx­Cup stand­ings be­hind him.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard had pow­ered to the top of the leader­board with a flurry of six birdies for a 64 – the low­est round of the tour­na­ment – but even his fi­nal birdie at­tempt came as a sur­prise to him.</p>
    <p>“Never did I think I’d be mak­ing an­other 50-, 60-footer – cou­ple of breaks in there, too, to end up win­ning it,” he said. “That stretch... it’s been a roller coaster but so much fun.”</p>
    <p>He started tied for sixth af­ter a third-round marred by a bad mis­take at the fifth hole, where he ab­sent­mind­edly picked up his ball on the green with­out mark­ing it and was as­sessed a penalty. But ev­ery</p>
    <p>Jon Rahm scream­ing in de­light af­ter sink­ing a 66-foot putt to edge out world No. 1 Dustin John­son at the first play-off hole of the BMW Cham­pi­onship on Sun­day. It was his sec­ond win of the sea­son and fifth over­all.</p>
    <p>thing just clicked for him in the fi­nal round.</p>
    <p>“Once I teed off to­day, in the good weather and how I started strip­ing it the first few holes, I knew I had a chance,” said the reign­ing Race to Dubai champion, who claimed his fifth Tour ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Less than 400 points sep­a­rate John­son and Rahm in the Cup stand­ings ahead of the fi­nale, with third-ranked Justin Thomas 901 points be­hind his com­pa­triot.</p>
    <p>On the line is a bonus prize of US$15 mil­lion (S$20.4 mil­lion), but de­spite the stiff com­pe­ti­tion, John­son is con­fi­dent of win­ning the FedEx­Cup for the first time.</p>
    <p>“I thought I played re­ally solid all day long (and) I like my po­si­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally, re­ally pleased with all as­pects of the game.”</p>
    <p>One no­table ab­sen­tee at the de­cider, how­ever, will be 15-time Ma­jor champion Tiger Woods. The for­mer world No. 1 needed a top-10 place to qual­ify, but in­stead carded a 71 for a 291 to­tal, fin­ish­ing joint-51st.</p>
    <p>This means his next tour­na­ment will be the sec­ond Ma­jor of the year, the Sept 17-20 US Open, and the Amer­i­can re­vealed that he would use the down­time to “clean up” his form, hav­ing only played four times on the Tour since February.</p>
