    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim met the Malaysian King yesterday af­ter a three-week de­lay, to claim he has ma­jor­ity sup­port to form a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war said at a news con­fer­ence later that he had passed “doc­u­ments” to Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din as proof that he has 120 MPs be­hind him, in the 222-seat Par­lia­ment. But Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah threw a sur­prise, with the na­tional palace say­ing that while Mr An­war did say how many law­mak­ers are be­hind him, he “did not pre­sent a list of the MPs’ names to sup­port his claim” at the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Umno is­sued a state­ment around 11pm that its po­lit­i­cal bureau will con­sider pulling out of Perikatan Na­sional, Malaysia’s gov­ern­ing al­liance, un­less it gets to set new terms for co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim met the Malaysian King yesterday and gave him the to­tal num­ber of law­mak­ers whom he claimed sup­ported him to be the next prime min­is­ter, but did not give their names to ver­ify his claim, said the palace.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the au­di­ence which lasted 25 min­utes, Datuk Seri An­war had pre­sented the to­tal num­ber of Lower House MPs whom he claimed sup­ported him,” palace comptrolle­r Datuk Ah­mad Fadil Sham­sud­din said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, he did not pre­sent a list of the MPs’ names to sup­port his claim. There­fore, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah (Ri’ay­atud­din) has ad­vised An­war to fol­low and re­spect the le­gal process as stated in the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing at Is­tana Ne­gara (na­tional palace) fol­lowed the Sept 23 shock an­nounce­ment by Mr An­war that he had the ma­jor­ity to form a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came seven months af­ter the col­lapse of the Pakatan Hara­pan gov­ern­ment in late Fe­bru­ary, which was led by Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>The ruler man­aged to meet him only yesterday af­ter he was hos­pi­talised for 12 days due to food poi­son­ing and a sports in­jury.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the royal au­di­ence, Datuk Seri An­war, 73, told a news con­fer­ence that he has the sup­port of more than 120 MPs i n the 222-mem­ber Par­lia­ment, enough to form the next gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“I have pre­sented a list of a con­vinc­ing ma­jor­ity of Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment who sup­port me to His Majesty,” Mr An­war said.</p>
    <p>“With these doc­u­ments, it is abun­dantly clear that we have reg­is­tered a for­mi­da­ble con­vinc­ing ma­jor­ity among par­lia­men­tar­i­ans.”</p>
    <p>He added that it would be “ap­pro­pri­ate” for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, who is also 73, to step down af­ter los­ing his ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The ruler is ex­pected to make a de­ci­sion in the com­ing days on whether Mr An­war has the “for­mi­da­ble” back­ing as he claimed, based on the ev­i­dence sub­mit­ted to him, and af­ter meet­ing po­lit­i­cal party lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war urged Malaysians to give space to Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah, 61, to ex­er­cise his dis­cre­tion, study the doc­u­ments and con­sult party lead­ers.</p>
    <p>“To­day is not the day of vic­tory, or a day of loss for any­one,” Mr An­war said.</p>
    <p>A few hours af­ter the An­war meet­ing, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah met Tengku Raza­leigh Hamzah, 83, chair­man of Umno’s board of ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>With its 39 MPs, Umno is the big­gest backer of the gov­ern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s Sept 23 claim of hav­ing ma­jor­ity sup­port in Par­lia­ment had been given im­me­di­ate cre­dence by Umno’s pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, who said on that same day that he knew of “many” Umno and Barisan Na­sional MPs who sup­port Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>The monarch is slated to meet the leader of op­po­si­tion Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) to­day. The DAP has the sin­gle largest bloc of MPs in the House with 42 law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war would need a min­i­mum of 112 MPs to claim ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional is widely held to have a ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity of 113 law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>The three-party Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion that Mr An­war leads cur­rently has 91 MPs – 38 law­mak­ers from his Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat, 42 from the DAP and 11 from Parti Amanah Ne­gara.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir, 95, is­sued a one­minute video that he is not en­dors­ing any in­di­vid­ual as prime min­is­ter, in a re­buff to Mr An­war. Dr Ma­hathir said that his new party, Pe­juang – with five op­po­si­tion MPs – re­mains in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din yesterday held a Face­book Live ses­sion for an hour with lo­cal me­dia, say­ing he is fo­cused on fight­ing Covid-19 and the strug­gling econ­omy, not the palace meet­ing. He is on home quar­an­tine, af­ter a Cab­i­net min­is­ter was found to be Covid-19 pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Asked to com­ment on the KingAn­war meet­ing, Mr Muhyid­din said: “I don’t want to com­ment on what An­war did at the palace. I leave it to the best judg­ment of the Agong (King); he has his own way of do­ing things as pro­vided by the Con­sti­tu­tion,” the Premier said, re­fer­ring to Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah.</p>
    <p>“When he (Mr An­war) was there at the palace, I was here (at home) in front of the tele­vi­sion hav­ing a</p>
    <p>video con­fer­ence with the mem­bers of the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil to dis­cuss the Covid-19 is­sue.</p>
    <p>“My in­ter­est now is in man­ag­ing Covid-19 and the econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s de­ci­sion not to give Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah his list of 120 MPs set Malaysia abuzz yesterday, with some ques­tion­ing whether he re­ally has the sup­port of enough par­lia­men­tar­i­ans to form the next gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Wan Sai­ful Wan Jan, in­for­ma­tion chief of Mr Muhyid­din’s Ber­satu party: “If this is the kind of des­per­ate strat­egy that he wants to use, then I sug­gest that he just re­tire from pol­i­tics and let other lead­ers take over the role of op­po­si­tion leader, so that it can be a con­struc­tive op­po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing the cur­rent con­cern of the gov­ern­ment about a third wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, the palace in its state­ment said the King is wor­ried about the pan­demic that has led the greater Kuala Lumpur area to be placed un­der move­ment curbs for two weeks from mid­night.</p>
