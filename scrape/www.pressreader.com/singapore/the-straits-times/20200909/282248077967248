    <p>•</p>
    <p>The Tokyo Games should be held next year “at any cost” given ath­letes’ ef­forts to be ready, Ja­pan’s Olympics Min­is­ter said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The reaf­fir­ma­tion came a day af­ter the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee’s (IOC) John Coates told Agence France Presse that the post­poned 2020 Games would go ahead “with or with­out Covid”.</p>
    <p>“For the Games next year, ath­letes are con­tin­u­ing to work hard in the en­vi­ron­ments they find them­selves in. So I feel we have to hold it at any cost,” Mrs Seiko Hashimoto said when asked about the IOC vice-pres­i­dent’s re­marks.</p>
    <p>“Mr Coates felt re­as­sured that the Tokyo Games can be held with fur­ther close co­or­di­na­tion of ef­forts.”</p>
    <p>Coates on Mon­day said in an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view that he was con­fi­dent the qua­dren­nial Olympics, which were pushed back for the first time, would open as planned next July, vow­ing they will be the “Games that con­quered Covid”.</p>
    <p>Masa Takaya, the spokesman for the Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers, did not com­ment di­rectly on whether they agreed with that as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he said that the re­marks showed “that the IOC team is fully com­mit­ted to de­liv­er­ing the Games next year”.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the bullish stance, there are press­ing is­sues. Ja­pan’s bor­ders are still largely closed to for­eign visi­tors and a vac­cine is months or even years away, feed­ing spec­u­la­tion about whether the Games are fea­si­ble at all.</p>
    <p>Un­cer­tainty also sur­rounds the fu­ture of Games spon­sor­ship.</p>
    <p>Sources have told Reuters that or­gan­is­ers have not ex­tended deals which are set to ex­pire by De­cem­ber, leav­ing some spon­sors to ques­tion whether to con­tinue, given the ad­di­tional costs in­volved.</p>
    <p>It is a dou­ble-edged sword though, as spon­sors fear dam­ag­ing their im­age by aban­don­ing a po­lit­i­cally im­por­tant na­tional pro­ject.</p>
    <p>“The de­lay threw fi­nan­cial plans for the Games into dis­ar­ray and many com­pa­nies re­ally don’t want to pay any more,” said an insider.</p>
    <p>Spon­sors ex­pect the con­tract ex­ten­sion ne­go­ti­a­tions to be fraught, said two more sources, both from spon­sors.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers raised a record US$3.1 bil­lion (S$4.3 bil­lion) in spon­sor­ship money from across Ja­pan through the ef­forts of ad­ver­tis­ing pow­er­house Dentsu, but many com­pa­nies are reel­ing from the Covid-19 eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>Reuters could not es­tab­lish the ad­di­tional cost of the ex­ten­sion fees, but lo­cal spon­sors’ con­tracts cover only Tokyo 2020, un­like a smaller num­ber of world­wide spon­sors.</p>
    <p>On the is­sue, or­gan­is­ers said they were “ask­ing our part­ners for their on­go­ing sup­port”.</p>
