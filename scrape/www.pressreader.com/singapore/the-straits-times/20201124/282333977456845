    <p>If you want an un­adorned quote on com­pet­i­tive­ness, you’ve got to rewind. Got to find a 1970s guy who thought pub­lic re­la­tions meant giv­ing the crowd the fin­ger. Got to pull out a half-kid­ding threat from an un­pol­ished guy which per­fectly il­lus­trated how ath­letes ac­tu­ally think.</p>
    <p>Like this old jewel.</p>
    <p>“I’ll chase the son of a b**** to the ends of the earth,” said Jimmy Con­nors of Bjorn Borg. “I’ll dog him ev­ery­where. Ev­ery time he looks around he’ll see my shadow.”</p>
    <p>Play­ers are po­liter now. Brands and all, you un­der­stand. But re­ally, what Con­nors said then is what ten­nis in 2021, just 38 days away, is go­ing to be. A lot of chas­ing, shad­ows, curs­ing. Rafa, 20 Slams, chas­ing 21. Roger Fed­erer chas­ing his flee­ing youth. No­vak Djokovic chas­ing pop­u­lar­ity. Young guys chas­ing them into re­tire­ment. Old guys chas­ing them off. Wait, who ex­actly is chas­ing who?</p>
    <p>This sport and its un­com­mon old men have long hit a sen­ti­men­tal nerve. On Mon­day, an English pro­fes­sor called for an­other mat­ter but she, 86, ended up talk­ing about ten­nis’ se­nior cit­i­zens. We spoke also about the Do­minic Thiem-Daniil Medvedev ATP Fi­nals ti­tle de­cider and I said it was ter­rific for ten­nis. Be­cause the griz­zled gang are go­ing to be livid. And when pro­voked they break noth­ing but their backs in prac­tice.</p>
    <p>You want to call Sun­day’s fi­nal an en­gag­ing slugfest, you’ll get full agree­ment. You want to use it to con­firm gen­er­a­tional change, I’ll just yawn. We’ve all said it for years now but, on the ATP rank­ings,</p>
    <p>No. 1 and No. 2 are still Serb and Spa­niard.</p>
    <p>The year-end cham­pi­onship is a round-robin rum­ble, a joust­ing of elites, but it’s still only a three-set test re­sult­ing in five one-time win­ners in the last five years. As ten­nis tea leaves, they’re not very help­ful to read. Grigor Dim­itrov won in 2017 and then didn’t make it past the first rounds of two of the four Slams in 2018.</p>
    <p>Sure, this fi­nal was fun. Her­cules in a hair­band from Aus­tria play­ing Medvedev, whose di­shev­elled look sug­gests more a dis­tracted Rus­sian sci­en­tist from a B-grade movie than a first-rate ath­lete. Cer­tainly he plays ten­nis like he is un­rav­el­ling a the­o­rem.</p>
    <p>The al­lur­ing thing about pro­fes­sional ath­letes is their will­ing­ness to skin their knees in a park­ing lot just to beat their lit­tle sis­ters. Com­pet­i­tive­ness is a riv­et­ing dis­ease. So an ab­sent crowd meant noth­ing in Lon­don, for both men chased balls with the com­mit­ment of debt col­lec­tors.</p>
    <p>Thiem has a wristy slice, lives in a post­code far be­hind the base­line and has a side career in car­pen­try. He doesn’t hit, he ham­mers. But Medvedev nailed him 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 be­cause he had more va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>At one point, he served and volleyed on a sec­ond serve and Thiem was so as­ton­ished at this Rus­sian Sam­pras that he missed an easy pass. In the sec­ond set, Thiem had a chance to surge ahead, but froze a lit­tle and then melted in the tie-breaker. He led 2-0 and then lost seven straight points.</p>
    <p>Even if you’re a pout­ing Rafa-No­vak fan, you have to ad­mit these young folk can play a bit. We’ll say there’ll never be an­other Rafa, and there won’t, but in the end it’s the game we rel­ish and the vary­ing ge­om­e­try of its new prac­ti­tion­ers, and we learn to start fresh love af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Well, maybe not quite yet. Of course, the un­der-30 guys are edg­ing closer, their en­ergy start­ing to blunt ex­pe­ri­ence and fray re­li­able old nerves. Nadal served for the match against Medvedev and lost. Djokovic led 4-0 in the fi­nal set tie-breaker against Thiem and lost. It’s like grand dams de­vel­op­ing mul­ti­ple cracks.</p>
    <p>Thiem beat Nadal in Aus­tralia and then Djokovic beat Thiem. In Paris, Djokovic beat Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas. In Lon­don, Thiem beat Djokovic and so did Medvedev, who also downed Nadal. Want to call it a draw? Not quite. The pen­sion­ers won two Slams of three this year and are yet to lose to a new-gen­er­a­tion player in a Slam fi­nal. Five sets is still the most pro­found wres­tle in ten­nis.</p>
    <p>The last time one of the Fab Four wasn’t world No. 1 was when Lance Arm­strong was fooling us in France. Late 2003. One day the reign will end, but it will have to seized.</p>
    <p>Till their nails break, old greats of­ten hang on to their sport. Only when Fed­erer’s knee is an un­fix­able mess can we over­look him. Only when Rafa tells us “no mas”, no more, and re­tires, can we say he’s done. Only when Djokovic tires of new di­ets can we con­sign him to the books.</p>
    <p>Till then, very po­litely un­like Con­nors, they’ll chase the young to the ends of the earth.</p>
    <p>On the map it’s called Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Rafa, 20 Slams, chas­ing 21. Roger Fed­erer chas­ing his flee­ing youth. No­vak Djokovic chas­ing pop­u­lar­ity. Young guys chas­ing them into re­tire­ment. Old guys chas­ing them off. Wait, who ex­actly is chas­ing who?</p>
