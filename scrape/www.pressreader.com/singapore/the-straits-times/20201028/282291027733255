    <p>•</p>
    <p>Lewis Hamil­ton and Mercedes team prin­ci­pal Toto Wolff will con­tinue their as­sault on For­mula One’s records next sea­son, the pair made clear in the af­ter­math of Hamil­ton’s landmark 92nd ca­reer win in last Sun­day’s Por­tuguese Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>While both have con­tracts with the Sil­ver Ar­rows that end this year and have avoided mak­ing any com­mit­ment for 2021, the pair erased doubts about their fu­ture to­gether in an out­fit set to claim a record sev­enth con­sec­u­tive con­struc­tors’ ti­tle at this week­end’s Emilia Ro­magna Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters via a pos­trace video news con­fer­ence, Wolff said he had agreed with his Daim­ler boss Ola Kael­le­nius “to con­tinue with each other” while Hamil­ton, in a sep­a­rate in­ter­view, said he would like to re­main with the Bri­tain-based Ger­man team.</p>
    <p>The re­mark­able re­la­tion­ship has pow­ered Mercedes to a record six con­sec­u­tive team ti­tles and, for Hamil­ton, five driv­ers’ wins since they linked up in 2013.</p>
    <p>“Where we stand to­day is that ev­ery­body has the will to con­tinue,” said Wolff.</p>
    <p>“With Lewis and I, it is sim­ply that we are liv­ing like her­mits and, I think, our team is par­tic­u­larly dis­ci­plined.</p>
    <p>“I hope we can fin­ish the next cou­ple of races on a high and then con­cen­trate on the con­tract.”</p>
    <p>Six-time world cham­pion Hamil­ton, who is odds-on to equal Michael Schu­macher’s record for the most num­ber of F1 cham­pi­onships this sea­son, also told Sky Sports he could still im­prove.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old Bri­ton said: “I don’t think I’m at my peak. I’m in a good area for sure, but I still want to con­tinue to race.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know how much longer that will be – this is a pe­riod of time when I’ve got to work out what the fu­ture holds. All I can say is I plan to be here next year.”</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton’s com­mit­ment to Mercedes will be greeted warmly by his team and the sport in gen­eral.</p>
    <p>“His achieve­ment is just phe­nom­e­nal,” said Mercedes’ track­side en­gi­neer­ing di­rec­tor An­drew Shovlin.</p>
    <p>“He doesn’t show any sign of giv­ing up or slow­ing down ei­ther. So, I sus­pect he’s go­ing to go on and hit some more mile­stones, but it’s just a phe­nom­e­nal achieve­ment.”</p>
