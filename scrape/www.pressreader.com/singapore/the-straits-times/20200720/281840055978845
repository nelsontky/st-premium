    <p>YAN­GON • China’s em­bassy in Myanmar yes­ter­day ac­cused the United States of “ou­tra­geously smear­ing” the coun­try and driv­ing a wedge with its South-east Asian neigh­bours over the con­tested South China Sea and Hong Kong, as ten­sions mount be­tween the su­per­pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to US claims that Bei­jing was un­der­min­ing the sovereignt­y of its neigh­bours, the Chi­nese em­bassy said US agen­cies abroad were do­ing “dis­gust­ing things” to con­tain China and had shown a “self­ish, hyp­o­crit­i­cal, con­temptible and ugly face”.</p>
    <p>The US last week har­dened its po­si­tion on the South China Sea, say­ing it would back coun­tries in the re­gion that chal­lenge Bei­jing’s claim to about 90 per cent of the strate­gic wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Satur­day, the US em­bassy i n Yan­gon called China’s ac­tions in the South China Sea and Hong Kong, where Bei­jing has im­posed tough new na­tional se­cu­rity laws, part of a “larger pat­tern to un­der­mine the sovereignt­y of its neigh­bours”.</p>
    <p>The US state­ment drew par­al­lels be­tween China’s ac­tions i n the South China Sea and Hong Kong with large-scale Chi­nese in­vest­ment projects in Myanmar that the US warned could be­come debt­traps, along with the traf­fick­ing of women from Myanmar to China as brides, and the in­flow of drugs from China into Myanmar.</p>
    <p>“This is how mod­ern sovereignt­y is of­ten lost – not through dra­matic, overt ac­tion, but through a cas­cade of smaller ones that lead to its slow ero­sion over time,” the US em­bassy said.</p>
    <p>In its re­buke, China said the state­ment showed a “sour grapes” at­ti­tude by the US to­wards “flour­ish­ing</p>
    <p>China-Myanmar re­la­tions” and was “an­other farce on a global tour by the US au­thor­i­ties to shift the at­ten­tion on do­mes­tic prob­lems and seek self­ish po­lit­i­cal gains”.</p>
    <p>“The US should first look in the mir­ror to see whether it still looks like a ma­jor coun­try now,” it said.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese em­bassy in Yan­gon did not an­swer phone calls seek­ing fur­ther com­ment.</p>
    <p>The US em­bassy was not im­me­di­ately avail­able for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Myanmar has in­creas­ingly be­come a bat­tle­ground for in­flu­ence be­tween the two coun­tries since re­la­tions be­tween the gov­ern­ment, led by No­bel lau­re­ate Aung San Suu Kyi, and the West be­came strained over its treat­ment of the Ro­hingya Mus­lim mi­nor­ity.</p>
    <p>Au­thor and his­to­rian Thant Myint-U told Reuters in an e-mail that although the coun­try was of neg­li­gi­ble eco­nomic value to the ri­vals, its strate­gic im­por­tance as a bridge be­tween main­land China and the Bay of Ben­gal was hard to ig­nore.</p>
    <p>“Myanmar’s in­stincts since in­de­pen­dence in 1948 are to try to be friends with ev­ery­one, but it’s not clear that’s go­ing to re­main pos­si­ble in this com­ing pe­riod of in­creas­ingly febrile su­per­power ri­valry,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The sheer weight of China’s gi­ant in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion next door is al­ready trans­form­ing Myanmar; if multi­bil­lion-dol­lar in­fra­struc­ture projects are added to the mix, the bor­der be­tween the two coun­tries will be­come in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult to see,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to re­mem­ber that Myanmar was one of the few coun­tries in the world where the last Cold War led to proxy armed fight­ing which, in turn, led to mil­i­tary dic­ta­tor­ship and decades of self-im­posed iso­la­tion.”</p>
