    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Eastern Euro­pean crim­i­nals are tar­get­ing dozens of US hos­pi­tals with ran­somware, and fed­eral of­fi­cials have urged health­care fa­cil­i­ties to beef up prepa­ra­tions rapidly in case they are next.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) is in­ves­ti­gat­ing the re­cent at­tacks, which in­clude in­ci­dents in Ore­gon, Cal­i­for­nia and New York made pub­lic just this week, three cy­ber-se­cu­rity con­sul­tants fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>A doc­tor at one hospi­tal said the fa­cil­ity was func­tion­ing on pa­per af­ter a cy­ber at­tack and un­able to trans­fer pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“We can still watch vi­tals and get­ting imag­ing done, but all re­sults are be­ing com­mu­ni­cated via pa­per only,” said the doc­tor, who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>Staff could see his­toric records but not up­date those files.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the likely group be­hind the at­tacks was known as Wiz­ard Spi­der or UNC 1878, and warned that such at­tacks can lead to loss of life.</p>
    <p>The at­tacks prompted a tele­con­fer­ence call on Wed­nes­day led by FBI and Home­land Se­cu­rity of­fi­cials for hospi­tal ad­min­is­tra­tors and cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­perts.</p>
    <p>A par­tic­i­pant said of­fi­cials warned hos­pi­tals to en­sure their backup sys­tems were in or­der, to dis­con­nect f rom the In­ter­net where pos­si­ble, and avoid us­ing per­sonal e-mail ac­counts.</p>
    <p>“This ap­pears to have been a co­or­di­nated at­tack de­signed to dis­rupt hos­pi­tals specif­i­cally all around the coun­try,” said threat in­tel­li­gence an­a­lyst Allan Liska with US cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm Recorded Fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“This is the first time we have seen six hos­pi­tals tar­geted in the same day by t he same ran­somware ac­tor.”</p>
    <p>Ran­somware at­tacks have jumped 50 per cent over the past three months, se­cu­rity firm Check Point said, with the pro­por­tion of polled health­care or­gan­i­sa­tions af­fected jump­ing to 4 per cent in the third quar­ter from 2.3 per cent in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Two of the con­sul­tants fa­mil­iar with the at­tacks said the cy­ber crim­i­nals were com­monly us­ing a ran­somware known as “Ryuk”, which locks up a vic­tim’s com­puter un­til a pay­ment is re­ceived.</p>
    <p>The tele­con­fer­ence call par­tic­i­pant said gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials dis­closed that the at­tack­ers used Ryuk and an­other tro­jan horse, known as Trick­bot, against the hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>“UNC 1878 is one of the most brazen, heart­less, and dis­rup­tive threat ac­tors I’ve ob­served over my ca­reer,” said Mr Charles Car­makal, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent for US cy­ber-in­ci­dent re­sponse firm Man­di­ant.</p>
