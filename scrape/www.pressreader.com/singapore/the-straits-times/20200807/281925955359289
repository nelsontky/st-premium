    <p>Af­ter spik­ing sharply in March amid a flight to safety as Covid-19 spread across the world, the US dol­lar has de­clined, by around 10 per cent, to a more than two-year low against a bas­ket of six ma­jor cur­ren­cies rep­re­sented in the so-called dol­lar in­dex. The de­cline gath­ered pace in July, which was the worst month for the green­back since April 2011. Some ob­servers be­lieve that the dol­lar’s weak­ness still has a long way to go, which would have ma­jor im­pli­ca­tions for the global econ­omy as well as var­i­ous in­vest­ment as­sets.</p>
    <p>Al­though the be­hav­iour of cur­rency mar­kets of­ten de­fies ex­pla­na­tion, there are sev­eral plau­si­ble rea­sons to which an­a­lysts at­tribute the re­cent weak­en­ing of the dol­lar. One is the like­li­hood that the United States will be harder hit by Covid-19 than most other de­vel­oped economies. The US Fed­eral Re­serve is also ex­pected to main­tain a looser-for-longer mon­e­tary pol­icy than other ma­jor cen­tral banks. With US in­ter­est rates near zero, the pos­i­tive in­ter­est dif­fer­en­tial be­tween the US and other de­vel­oped economies such as the euro zone and Ja­pan has al­most dis­ap­peared and US bond yields are also near zero – which di­min­ishes the dol­lar’s at­trac­tive­ness. The prospect of ever larger US deficits and debts which would be mon­e­tised by the Fed has raised fears of cur­rency de­base­ment. The dol­lar’s weak­en­ing against the euro in re­cent days has also been partly driven by the EU’s de­ci­sion to re­sort to col­lec­tive bor­row­ing un­der­writ­ten by the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, which has re­duced the risk at­tached to Euro­pean as­sets and thereby boosted the euro.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther weak­en­ing of the dol­lar could cause sev­eral dis­rup­tions, both neg­a­tive and pos­i­tive. On the neg­a­tive side, it could raise the threat of in­fla­tion in the US, which would limit the Fed’s abil­ity to keep rates at near-zero for a pro­longed pe­riod. Con­versely, the strength­en­ing of some other cur­ren­cies such as the euro and the Ja­panese yen would ag­gra­vate de­fla­tion­ary pres­sures in these economies and ham­per their re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>On the pos­i­tive side, a weaker dol­lar would be a plus for sev­eral emerg­ing economies which would be bet­ter able to ser­vice their dol­lar­de­nom­i­nated debts and also at­tract in­vest­ments. Sev­eral emerg­ing economies’ cur­ren­cies have risen against the dol­lar over the last month. These economies might also ben­e­fit from a rise in com­mod­ity prices which is typ­i­cally as­so­ci­ated with a weak­en­ing dol­lar.</p>
    <p>But none of this is as­sured. The un­pre­dictable course of the Covid-19 pandemic and ris­ing geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions could cause ad­di­tional bouts of fear and panic, trig­ger­ing, yet again, a flight to the safety of the US dol­lar. The dol­lar’s po­si­tion as the top re­serve cur­rency is also, for now, not un­der threat. So the dol­lar’s de­cline is by no means a fore­gone con­clu­sion. But its tra­jec­tory bears watch­ing in the months ahead.</p>
