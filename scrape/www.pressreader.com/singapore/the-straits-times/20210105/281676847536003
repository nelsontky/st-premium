    <p>Yes­ter­day’s Par­lia­ment sit­ting was notable for two “firsts” – it was the first one this year, and also the first to be live-streamed.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic could fol­low the pro­ceed­ings in real time on the Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion YouTube chan­nel, a move sev­eral months in the mak­ing. It was flagged last Septem­ber by Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran.</p>
    <p>Once the veil of mys­tery was lifted from the cham­ber, the ses­sion fol­lowed a well-trod­den path. The big con­cerns of the day came up for dis­cus­sion, in­clud­ing Covid-19, so­cial sup­port, the el­derly, and the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>On Covid-19 vac­cines, those who tuned in would have drawn four key points from Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong’s min­is­te­rial state­ment.</p>
    <p>First, there will be enough free vac­cines for all Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents in Sin­ga­pore. They will not, how­ever, be able to dic­tate their choice of vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, cur­rent vac­cines will likely be ef­fec­tive against the new strain.</p>
    <p>Third, prior book­ings to get vac­ci­nated will be nec­es­sary; and fi­nally, all who are vac­ci­nated will be is­sued a vac­ci­na­tion card to re­mind them of fol­low-up ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>But the larger, more im­por­tant mes­sage was that Sin­ga­pore­ans must not let their guard down.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Gan, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong warned that vac­ci­na­tion is “not a sil­ver bul­let”. Global cases con­tinue to es­ca­late rapidly, he said, and in Sin­ga­pore alone there have al­ready been two fam­ily clus­ters in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>An­other hot but­ton is­sue was the ter­mi­na­tion of the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore high-speed rail (HSR) project. The deal-breaker for Sin­ga­pore, ex­plained</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung, was that it could not ac­cept Malaysia’s pro­posal to re­move the re­quire­ment for a jointly ap­pointed As­sets Com­pany – the sys­tems sup­plier and net­work op­er­a­tor of the HSR – a “fun­da­men­tal de­par­ture” from the orig­i­nal agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Given that nei­ther coun­try has the ex­per­tise in op­er­at­ing the HSR, said Mr Ong, both sides had ear­lier agreed to ap­point a best-in-class in­dus­try player through an open and trans­par­ent in­ter­na­tional ten­der. The goal was to have a sin­gle train sys­tem op­er­at­ing be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Kuala Lumpur that would be ac­count­able to both sides.</p>
    <p>Given ac­cel­er­ated dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion due to Covid-19, mem­bers also ad­dressed the need to en­sure that the el­derly are not left be­hind.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from Work­ers’ Party’s Mr Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC), For­eign Min­is­ter and Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan said that de­spite the dis­con­tin­u­a­tion of the OneKey to­ken from April 1, res­i­dents who do not own a mo­bile phone will still be able to ac­cess govern­ment e-ser­vices us­ing SingPass.</p>
    <p>He gave the as­sur­ance that there is no time­line to phase out phys­i­cal coun­ters to ac­cess these ser­vices, in­clud­ing govern­ment agency ser­vice cen­tres and li­braries.</p>
    <p>But bridg­ing the skills gap and help­ing the el­derly to cross this hur­dle is crit­i­cal, he added.</p>
    <p>This is where the SG Dig­i­tal Of­fice – which has dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors present to help se­niors with ser­vices – is use­ful, said Dr Balakr­ish­nan. He also took note of Mr Giam’s sug­ges­tion that phys­i­cal coun­ters be ex­tended to so­cial ser­vice of­fices.</p>
    <p>On­go­ing con­cerns over data pri­vacy and the use of TraceTo­gether were also raised.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from Mr Christo­pher de Souza (Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC), Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan clar­i­fied that the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force is em­pow­ered un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code to ob­tain any data.</p>
    <p>“We do not pre­clude the use of TraceTo­gether data in cir­cum­stances where cit­i­zens’ safety and se­cu­rity are or have been af­fected, and this ap­plies to all other data as well,” said Mr Tan, in re­sponse to a sup­ple­men­tary ques­tion from Mr Giam who asked if use of the data would vi­o­late the TraceTo­gether pri­vacy state­ment.</p>
    <p>Also men­tioned was a Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ment study re­leased last month, which showed that chil­dren of di­vorced par­ents tend to earn less, and are more likely to get di­vorced, than their peers from in­tact fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>On the sup­port avail­able to these chil­dren, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion Ma­liki Os­man said school coun­sel­lors are on hand for stu­dents who ex­hibit emo­tional dis­tress or so­cial and be­havioural changes due to their par­ents’ di­vorce. Teach­ers also proac­tively look out for any changes in be­hav­iour, and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance is avail­able to those who need it, he added.</p>
    <p>The is­sues raised yes­ter­day are not new. But they will sharpen against the back­drop of the un­even tra­jec­tory of the pan­demic and its un­cer­tain im­pact on the econ­omy, as well as a rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion and chang­ing so­cial trends.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns over a grow­ing fis­cal bur­den, in­equal­ity and in­ter­gen­er­a­tional mo­bil­ity have al­ready come to the fore.</p>
    <p>As for live-stream­ing Par­lia­ment pro­ceed­ings, the au­thor­i­ties have long been re­luc­tant to do so, cit­ing rea­sons such as the risk of MPs play­ing to the gallery. Re­tired diplo­mat Bi­la­hari Kausikan re­it­er­ated these con­cerns in a Face­book post yes­ter­day, call­ing the move a “mis­take” that could change the po­lit­i­cal dy­namic in such a way as to in­cen­tivise “a cer­tain sort of per­son­al­ity to en­ter pol­i­tics and not the kind who ought to be a po­lit­i­cal leader”.</p>
    <p>As Mr Iswaran said yes­ter­day, the in­tegrity and dig­nity of Par­lia­ment as a fo­rum for se­ri­ous de­bate on na­tional is­sues must be pre­served. “Ul­ti­mately, the re­spon­si­bil­ity rests with all mem­bers of this House, present and fu­ture, who must con­tinue to up­hold the high­est stan­dards of con­duct and deco­rum, as we en­gage in the cut and thrust of par­lia­men­tary de­bate,” he said.</p>
    <p>Was this open­ing ses­sion the lull be­fore the storm?</p>
    <p>Whether Mr Kausikan’s com­ments will prove pre­scient is any­one’s guess, but the mea­sured tone of yes­ter­day’s de­bate gave lit­tle cause for alarm.</p>
    <p>For ev­ery rogue politi­cian who sees this as an op­por­tu­nity to let loose, one can imag­ine many oth­ers who would choose their words more care­fully in front of a na­tion of live view­ers.</p>
    <p>As for crit­ics who placed their bets on huge pent-up pub­lic in­ter­est, it may have been a case of “too early to call”.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of view­ers on MCI’s live stream hov­ered be­low 4,000 most of the time and dipped to around 500 by the close of day, lend­ing cre­dence to the au­thor­i­ties’ ear­lier ob­ser­va­tion that pub­lic de­mand for a live stream – at least for now – is not all that high, not­with­stand­ing its pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion and en­gage­ment value.</p>
