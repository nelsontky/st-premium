    <p>The Mi­crosoft Sur­face Go 2 tack­les its pre­de­ces­sor’s flaws with limited suc­cess.</p>
    <p>The en­try-level model i n the Sur­face line of two-in-one Win­dows con­vert­ibles, the Go 2 adds the op­tion for a more pow­er­ful pro­ces­sor and has a slightly larger screen than last year’s model.</p>
    <p>The pro­ces­sor op­tion – an In­tel Core m3 chip – is found in my souped-up re­view set, which also comes with LTE 4G con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft says t he Core m3 vari­ant of­fers up to 64 per cent faster per­for­mance than the Sur­face Go. The newer ver­sion cer­tainly showed much im­prove­ment in the PCMark 10 bench­mark – it scored 2,881 com­pared with 1,902 for its pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>The Go 2 feels snappy while brows­ing the In­ter­net and watch­ing Net­flix videos. But it slows down if I open too many apps at the same time.</p>
    <p>But you may not feel much of a speed boost if you opt for the base model of the Sur­face Go 2, which comes with an In­tel Pen­tium 4425Y chip. While I did not test it, this chip ap­pears to be just 100MHz faster in clock speed than the one in the Sur­face Go.</p>
    <p>The 10.5-inch screen on the Sur­face Go 2 does not seem like much of an up­grade com­pared with the pre­vi­ous model’s 10-inch dis­play. But the slight bump in screen size, cou­pled with slim­mer screen bezels, makes the Go 2’s dis­play look more mod­ern. Its 1,920 x 1,280-pixel res­o­lu­tion looks sharp for its size and the colours look ac­cu­rate.</p>
    <p>Like other Sur­face de­vices, the screen has a 3:2 as­pect ra­tio that is more suited for edit­ing doc­u­ments as it of­fers more ver­ti­cal screen space.</p>
    <p>Apart from the screen and pro­ces­sor, the Sur­face Go 2 is very sim­i­lar to the older ver­sion. Both have a grey mag­ne­sium chas­sis that weighs around 500g.</p>
    <p>They also have the same ports, which in­clude a USB Type-C port, the pro­pri­etary Sur­face Con­nect port and a mi­croSD card slot.</p>
    <p>For bio­met­ric se­cu­rity, the Sur­face Go 2 re­lies on an in­frared Web cam­era with the Win­dows Hello fa­cial recog­ni­tion fea­ture.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, it re­tains the in­te­grated kick­stand that opens up to 165 de­grees and en­ables the con­vert­ible to switch be­tween tablet and lap­top forms – with a de­tach­able key­board ac­ces­sory for the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>This Type Cover key­board (from $148, sold sep­a­rately), which at­taches to the Sur­face Go 2 mag­net­i­cally, is back­lit and has good key travel and a smooth touch­pad.</p>
    <p>But com­pared with a stan­dard key­board, the keys on the Type Cover seem to have been shifted slightly to the left, which threw me off ini­tially. Given its rel­a­tively com­pact size, the key­board is pre­dictably cramped and ex­hibits some flex in the mid­dle.</p>
    <p>Like the pre­vi­ous model, the Go 2 comes with a re­stricted ver­sion of Win­dows 10 Home (S mode) that lim­its users to ver­i­fied apps from the Mi­crosoft Store, akin to a smart­phone. I highly rec­om­mend switch­ing to the proper ver­sion of Win­dows 10 in the set­tings im­me­di­ately – an ir­re­versible but nec­es­sary process.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause S mode re­stricts ex­e­cutable files such as the in­stal­la­tion files for desk­top apps such as the Chrome browser. In addition, you can­not change the Bing search en­gine to an­other provider in the Mi­crosoft Edge browser in S mode.</p>
    <p>De­spite its mod­est 27-watt-hour bat­tery, the Go 2 man­aged a de­cent 6hr 9min in The Straits Times’ video-loop bat­tery test. While this re­sult is not quite up to the seven to eight hours clocked by top ul­tra­books, it is still re­spectable.</p>
    <p>While the base model may be priced at­trac­tively ($648), I would rec­om­mend the m3 vari­ant ($1,168) for all but the most ca­sual of users.</p>
    <p>Add in the cost of the ac­ces­sories (from $148 for the key­board and $148 for the Sur­face Pen) and the Sur­face Go 2 can eas­ily cost more than a de­cent ul­tra­book that is better in al­most ev­ery way ex­cept for weight and LTE con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
