    <p>As col­leges through­out the United States re­open, fac­ing a weird new land­scape of empty rooms and scat­tered class­mates, it’s easy to won­der what these tra­di­tional places of learn­ing still have to teach the rest of us. Long be­fore the pan­demic, cam­puses were in the news not so much for open­ing young minds as for clos­ing down dis­cus­sions and less for en­cour­ag­ing hu­man­ity than for pro­mot­ing ide­olo­gies.</p>
    <p>Upon my own re­turn to a univer­sity class­room, in the spring of last year, af­ter a hia­tus of 37 years, I imag­ined that my tastes and val­ues, my very lan­guage, might seem out of date to many of the stu­dents I was in­struct­ing, and I’m sure they did. I sus­pected that these teenagers would be much less con­cerned with books than I and my old class­mates were, and I was right. I as­sumed that as a writer who had been criss-cross­ing the globe for 45 years, I’d have wis­dom about travel to im­part, and I was wrong: Thanks in part to their gen­er­ous and well-en­dowed univer­sity, the 16 un­der­grad­u­ates in front of me spent the first class speak­ing of re­cent trips they’d taken to Nauru and Kyr­gyzs­tan and Hongpo, among other places I’d barely heard of.</p>
    <p>In al­most ev­ery way, the young at this elite univer­sity seemed brighter, more ma­ture, more re­li­able and in­fin­itely more glob­ally aware than I and my pals had been in our rad­i­cally less di­verse day. But the most beau­ti­ful sur­prise was to see how deeply many of them had ab­sorbed lessons not to be found in any text­book.</p>
    <p>Pick­ing up a cam­pus news­pa­per one day, I found an ar­ti­cle by the per­son I’d fool­ishly taken to be our class clown. He went to mass ev­ery Sun­day, he wrote, pre­cisely be­cause he had no religious com­mit­ment. He wanted to learn about per­spec­tives other than the ones he knew. He ad­mired the dis­ci­pline and sense of or­der en­cour­aged by such a prac­tice, which he felt he might lack other­wise. He’d been star­tled by the open-mind­ed­ness of a de­vout room­mate, with whom he used to ar­gue through the night. If some­one of religious faith could be so re­spon­sive to other po­si­tions, he wrote, should not a sec­u­lar lib­eral as­pire to the same?</p>
    <p>I re­alised, as I read the piece, that I had lit­tle to teach such stu­dents in a class os­ten­si­bly about ex­plor­ing cul­tures dif­fer­ent from our own. More deeply, I was im­pressed by how imag­i­na­tively a young per­son was ad­dress­ing the cen­tral prob­lem of the times: the fact we’re all united mostly by our di­vi­sive­ness.</p>
    <p>Whether in the con­text of cli­mate change or the right to life – let alone the ethics of try­ing to pro­tect oth­ers from a killer virus by sim­ply wear­ing a mask – more and more of us refuse ever to cross party lines. And in an age of so­cial me­dia, when we all imag­ine we can best cap­ture the world’s at­ten­tion by shout­ing as loudly as pos­si­ble, there’s ev­ery in­cen­tive to take the most ex­treme – and po­lar­is­ing – po­si­tion around.</p>
    <p>Our in­sti­tu­tions are not go­ing to solve this; they (and the un­wis­dom of crowds) are of­ten the prob­lem. As the wise Fran­cis­can priest Richard Rohr points out, the only thing more dan­ger­ous than in­di­vid­ual ego is group ego.</p>
    <p>That’s one rea­son I, driv­ing around blue-state Santa Bar­bara, Cal­i­for­nia, try to lis­ten to Fox News – I can get plenty of the other side from my friends. It’s also why I, though not a Chris­tian, seek out the clar­ity of Fa­ther Rohr. We’re caught up in an ad­dic­tion to sim­pli­fi­ca­tions for which the only medicine lies within. We need to be re­minded that not to be right doesn’t al­ways mean you’re wrong. And that to be ter­ri­bly wronged does not mean you’re in­no­cent. The world deals in black-or-whites no more than a hur­ri­cane or a virus does.</p>
    <p>It’s hardly sur­pris­ing that so many cit­i­zens, un­able to find wis­dom in the po­lit­i­cal sphere (which, al­most by def­i­ni­tion, thrives on ei­ther/ors), look to religious fig­ures for a more in­clu­sive vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Pope Fran­cis, in Wim Wen­ders’ glo­ri­ous doc­u­men­tary A Man Of His Word, stresses the im­por­tance of not im­pos­ing our views on oth­ers and never think­ing in terms of sim­plis­tic us-ver­sus-thems: Would God, Pope Fran­cis asks, love Gandhi any less than he does a priest or a nun sim­ply be­cause the</p>
    <p>Ma­hatma wasn’t a Chris­tian? The Dalai Lama, for his part, points out that to be pro-Ti­betan is not to be anti-Chi­nese, not least be­cause Ti­bet and China will al­ways be neigh­bours; the wel­fare of ei­ther de­pends on the other. He be­gins his days by pray­ing for the health of his “Chi­nese broth­ers and sis­ters”.</p>
    <p>Trav­el­ling across Japan with the Dalai Lama a year be­fore the pan­demic, I heard him say of­ten that af­ter watch­ing the planet up close as a leader of his peo­ple for what was then 79 years, he felt the world was suf­fer­ing through an “emo­tional cri­sis”. The cure, he said, was “emo­tional dis­ar­ma­ment”.</p>
    <p>What he meant by the strik­ing phrase was that we can see be­yond panic and rage and con­fu­sion only by us­ing our minds, and that part of the mind that doesn’t deal in bi­na­ries. Emo­tional dis­ar­ma­ment might prove even more fea­si­ble than the nu­clear type, in­so­far as most of us can re­form our minds more eas­ily than we can move a huge and in­tractable gov­ern­ment. By open­ing our minds, we be­gin to change the world.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gion it­self, of course, can be as sec­tar­ian as the en­mi­ties it de­plores, which is why the Dalai Lama, one of the world’s most vis­i­ble religious fig­ures, pub­lished a book ti­tled Be­yond Re­li­gion. It’s why he puts much of his faith in sci­ence, whose laws and dis­cov­er­ies lie be­yond hu­man divi­sions and ap­ply equally to be­liever and non-be­liever, Mus­lim and Jew. Yet the same wis­dom was ap­par­ent to me in 16 stu­dents who seemed ready to look be­yond con­ve­nient dogma and de­hu­man­is­ing ab­strac­tion.</p>
    <p>One of them, a sunny and very per­son­able gay ath­lete, was an un­abashed sup­porter of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump (what­ever, he as­serted, the Pres­i­dent might say about gay rights). When I handed out an ex­cerpt from for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s Dreams From My Fa­ther for our group to read and dis­cuss, I was prop­erly ap­pre­hen­sive.</p>
    <p>The minute we as­sem­bled the fol­low­ing week, up shot the hand of the pas­sion­ate Trumpite. He’d been stunned, he said, by the in­tel­li­gence, the elo­quence and the sub­tlety of “Pres­i­dent Obama”, as he re­spect­fully called him. “I don’t agree with many of his po­si­tions,” he said, “and I wouldn’t vote for him.”</p>
    <p>But how could he not be swayed by the hu­man­ity of the man’s com­mand of the word and the power of his prose? He’d been so im­pressed that af­ter com­plet­ing the 20-page as­sign­ment, he’d spent the week­end go­ing through the en­tire 442-page book.</p>
    <p>Of all the many things I learnt in that class­room, per­haps that was the most valu­able. If some­one barely of vot­ing age could open his mind so ex­pan­sively, how could I and oth­ers a gen­er­a­tion or two older con­tinue act­ing like pre-school­ers?</p>
    <p>We alone among the an­i­mals, the Dalai Lama reg­u­larly points out, en­joy rea­son­ing minds, the ca­pac­ity to see be­yond re­flex. The best rea­son to go to school, even if you’re a so-called teacher, is to find out how much you don’t know.</p>
    <p>Pico Iyer is the au­thor of 15 books, most re­cently the com­pan­ion works Au­tumn Light and A Be­gin­ner’s Guide To Japan.</p>
