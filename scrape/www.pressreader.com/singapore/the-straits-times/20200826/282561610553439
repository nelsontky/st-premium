    <p>UNITED STATES • Audible is rolling out a cheaper ver­sion of its pop­u­lar au­dio­book ser­vice, which will in­clude an orig­i­nal se­ries fea­tur­ing Hol­ly­wood talent, as part of a new drive to go beyond books and win over podcast lis­ten­ers.</p>
    <p>Audible Plus will cost US$7.95 (S$10.89) a month, about half the price of the main plan, and in­clude more than 11,000 ti­tles span­ning au­dio­books, orig­i­nal se­ries and pod­casts, the com­pany said on Monday.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing slate of new pro­grammes in­cludes projects from mu­si­cians Com­mon and St Vin­cent, as well as ac­tors Jesse Eisen­berg and Kate Mara.</p>
    <p>The cat­a­logue is al­ready avail­able to ex­ist­ing Audible users, with the new plan be­ing rolled out in pre­view form.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing taken a dom­i­nant po­si­tion in au­dio­books, the Ama­zon.com di­vi­sion has been try­ing to break i nto the boom­ing mar­ket for pod­casts and other non­mu­sic au­dio.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has com­mis­sioned pro­grammes from best-sell­ing authors and celebri­ties, emerg­ing as one of the big­gest back­ers of orig­i­nal au­dio shows.</p>
    <p>The cheaper plan is the clear­est sign yet of Audible’s am­bi­tions to com­pete with Spo­tify as the go-to app for mil­lions of lis­ten­ers in­ter­ested in non-music au­dio.</p>
    <p>This is the first time Audible has of­fered such a large se­lec­tion of shows as part of a monthly sub­scrip­tion, rather than re­quir­ing peo­ple to buy in­di­vid­ual ti­tles.</p>
    <p>“It’s a mag­i­cal mo­ment in the renaissanc­e of au­dio, and we want to be at the fore­front of that,” said Ms Rachel Ghi­azza, Audible’s head of United States con­tent.</p>
    <p>She iden­ti­fied a new project with Eisen­berg as a prime ex­am­ple of what the com­pany is at­tempt­ing. “It’s kind of a podcast, kind of an au­dio­book and kind of live the­atre.”</p>
    <p>Audible be­gan de­vel­op­ing the project with Eisen­berg af­ter he recorded au­dio for a col­lec­tion of po­ems.</p>
    <p>Un­der Audible’s pre­vi­ous model, sub­scribers paid a monthly fee in ex­change for cred­its to buy books. That meant cus­tomers would use the ser­vice only when they had new books or cred­its.</p>
    <p>With the new ap­proach, Audible sub­scribers will get ac­cess to a deeper li­brary of shows, in­clud­ing con­tri­bu­tions from ac­tress Jamie Lee Cur­tis, bas­ket­ball star Blake Grif­fin and best-sell­ing author Ta­yari Jones.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers can still pay to lis­ten to new books or se­lect orig­i­nals not in­cluded in the sub­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>That same li­brary will be part of the cur­rent plan, re­named Audible Pre­mium Plus, which also in­cludes a monthly credit for an au­dio­book.</p>
    <p>But Audible is bet­ting this new li­brary will make its app a daily stop in the grow­ing com­pe­ti­tion for lis­ten­ers.</p>
    <p>Spo­tify has been mak­ing its own push in the podcast mar­ket. It spent more than US$1 bil­lion ac­quir­ing com­pa­nies and fund­ing orig­i­nal au­dio se­ries, emerg­ing as the sec­ond most pop­u­lar podcast plat­form af­ter Apple.</p>
    <p>Though Apple re­mains the dom­i­nant player in the US and many in­ter­na­tional mar­kets, it has yet to com­mit to fund­ing orig­i­nal au­dio pro­gram­ming in a big way. Both Spo­tify and Apple of­fer thou­sands of ti­tles for free.</p>
