    <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un de­clared an emer­gency and a lock­down in a bor­der town af­ter a per­son sus­pected of be­ing in­fected with the coronaviru­s re­turned from South Korea af­ter il­le­gally cross­ing the bor­der, state me­dia said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>SEOUL • North Korean leader Kim Jong Un de­clared an emer­gency and a lock­down in a bor­der town af­ter a per­son sus­pected of be­ing in­fected with the coronaviru­s re­turned from South Korea af­ter il­le­gally cross­ing the bor­der, state me­dia said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>If con­firmed, it would be the first case of­fi­cially ac­knowl­edged by the North Korean au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim con­vened an emer­gency polit­buro meet­ing in re­sponse to what he called a “crit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion in which the vi­cious virus could be said to have en­tered the coun­try”, the North’s KCNA state news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>A per­son who de­fected to South Korea three years ago re­turned across the for­ti­fied bor­der that di­vides the two Koreas to the town of Kaesong this month with symp­toms of Covid-19, the dis­ease caused by the coronaviru­s, KCNA re­ported.</p>
    <p>“An emer­gency event hap­pened in Kaesong City where a run­away who went to the South three years ago, a per­son who is sus­pected to have been in­fected with the vi­cious virus, re­turned on July 19 af­ter il­le­gally cross­ing the de­mar­ca­tion line,” KCNA said.</p>
    <p>KCNA did not say if the per­son had been tested, but said an “un­cer­tain re­sult was made from sev­eral med­i­cal check-ups of the se­cre­tion of that per­son’s up­per res­pi­ra­tory or­gan and blood”, prompt­ing of­fi­cials to quar­an­tine the per­son and in­ves­ti­gate any­one he may have been in con­tact with.</p>
    <p>One an­a­lyst said the an­nounce­ment was im­por­tant not only be­cause North Korea was for the first time re­port­ing a sus­pected coronaviru­s case, but also be­cause it sug­gested the coun­try was ap­peal­ing for help.</p>
    <p>“It’s an ice-break­ing mo­ment for North Korea to ad­mit a case,” said Pro­fes­sor Choo Jae-woo from Kyung Hee Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“It could be reach­ing out to the world for help. Per­haps for hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance.”</p>
    <p>North Korea is under eco­nomic pres­sure be­cause of in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions over its nu­clear pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Mr Cho Han-bum, a se­nior fel­low at the Korea In­sti­tute for Na­tional Uni­fi­ca­tion in Seoul, said it was sig­nif­i­cant that North Korea was re­port­ing its first sus­pected coronaviru­s case as im­ported.</p>
    <p>“North Korea is in such a dire sit­u­a­tion where they can’t even fin­ish build­ing the Py­ongyang Gen­eral Hospi­tal on time,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Point­ing the blame at an ‘im­ported case’ from South Korea, the North can use this as a way to openly ac­cept aid from the South.”</p>
    <p>KCNA did not elab­o­rate on how the uniden­ti­fied “run­away” had crossed one of the world’s most heav­ily guarded bor­ders, but said the in­ci­dent was be­ing in­ves­ti­gated and the mil­i­tary unit re­spon­si­ble would face “se­vere pun­ish­ment”.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staffs (JCS) said there was a “high chance” that some­one had in­deed crossed the bor­der and the mil­i­tary was check­ing sur­veil­lance footage.</p>
    <p>It even sug­gested it might be able to iden­tify the per­son.</p>
    <p>“Our mil­i­tary has spec­i­fied some peo­ple and is ver­i­fy­ing facts in close col­lab­o­ra­tion with re­lated agen­cies,” the JCS said.</p>
    <p>North Korea has re­ceived thou­sands of coronaviru­s-test­ing kits from Rus­sia and other coun­tries and has im­posed strict bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple in North Korea were also quar­an­tined as it took pre­cau­tions to pre­vent an out­break, but re­stric­tions had re­cently been eased.</p>
    <p>AP­PAR­ENT AP­PEAL</p>
    <p>It’s an ice-break­ing mo­ment for North Korea to ad­mit a case. It could be reach­ing out to the world for help. Per­haps for ’’ hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR CHOO JAE-WOO, from Kyung Hee Univer­sity.</p>
