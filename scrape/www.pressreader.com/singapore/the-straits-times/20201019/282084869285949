    <p>This is the ninth in the ST Le­gal Se­ries that high­lights le­gal top­ics of in­ter­est. The aim of the ar­ti­cles by Se­nior Law Cor­re­spon­dent K.C. Vi­jayan is to in­form and en­hance aware­ness. Today’s sub­ject dwells on in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion and Sin­ga­pore’s lead­ing role as a hub to set­tle dis­putes.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic’s ar­bi­tra­tion ac­tiv­ity has been up­beat, with the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Ar­bi­tra­tion Cen­tre (SIAC) and other in­dus­try play­ers see­ing con­tin­ued growth.</p>
    <p>The size of ar­bi­tra­tion claims has ex­panded. An ex­am­ple is Ama­zon’s claim, launched in the SIAC against In­dia’s Fu­ture Group to block a US$3.4 bil­lion (S$4.6 bil­lion) sale of its re­tail busi­ness to Re­liance In­dus­tries, as re­ported in Global Ar­bi­tra­tion Re­view ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The SIAC, an in­de­pen­dent, not­for-profit en­tity, has a track record of serv­ing the global busi­ness com­mu­nity. “Our caseload this year has con­tin­ued to ex­pe­ri­ence strong growth, notwith­stand­ing the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion,” its chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Lim Seok Hui said last week.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong noted in Par­lia­ment ear­lier this month that SIAC saw a new high of 479 case fil­ings last year.</p>
    <p>“This is the third con­sec­u­tive year that SIAC’s caseload has ex­ceeded 400, and we will aim to do even bet­ter in the com­ing years,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Paris-head­quar­tered In­ter­na­tional Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion of the In­ter­na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce (ICC) has a case man­age­ment of­fice in Sin­ga­pore. Af­ter a brief slow­down in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, the ICC said it has seen in­creased ar­bi­tra­tion ac­tiv­ity in all re­gions, in­clud­ing Asia.</p>
    <p>“For the last 10 years, Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to be the top place of ICC ar­bi­tra­tion in Asia, and we con­tinue to see this trend even in 2020.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based ICC Court di­rec­tor Ab­hi­nav Bhushan said the role of ICC, op­er­at­ing from Maxwell Cham­bers Suites, is to ad­min­is­ter ar­bi­tra­tions pre­dom­i­nantly with a nexus to this re­gion.</p>
    <p>The ICC Court in­au­gu­rated the Sec­re­tariat of the ICC In­ter­na­tional Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion Sin­ga­pore (Si­cas) in April 2018.</p>
    <p>As at last Thurs­day, Si­cas has man­aged 227 cases, out of which 48 are new ones re­ceived this year, Mr Bhushan added.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers like Wong-Part­ner­ship’s head of lit­i­ga­tion and dis­pute res­o­lu­tion Chou Sean Yu said the firm con­tin­ues to see cases com­ing in and “sev­eral are ac­tu­ally quite high-pro­file and big ticket”.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think the pan­demic has re­sulted in a slow­down – I can cer­tainly say that we have not seen any de­cline in ar­bi­tra­tion cases. It may be partly be­cause many of these dis­putes may have been brew­ing, any­way, for some time.</p>
    <p>“That said, there are dis­putes which have arisen be­cause of a com­mer­cial fall­out caused or cre­ated by the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Oon & Bazul’s manag­ing part­ner Bazul Ash­hab sug­gested that re­cent de­vel­op­ments in Hong Kong – like the re­cent post­pone­ment by its Chief Ex­ec­u­tive of her an­nual pol­icy ad­dress and the Greater Bay Area ini­tia­tive – will chal­lenge the city’s po­si­tion as an ar­bi­tra­tion seat and “will in­crease in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion work to Sin­ga­pore at the very least in the im­me­di­ate term”.</p>
    <p>“We have in­vested sub­stan­tially in tech­nol­ogy and train­ing to be in the fore­front of in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion work,” he added.</p>
    <p>Law part­ner Syazana Yahya of law firm Eu­gene Thu­raisingam LLP said: “We have seen a rise in the num­ber of ex­pe­dited ar­bi­tra­tions. These would typ­i­cally in­volve claimants with smaller claims and, in the wake of Covid-19, the loom­ing threat of in­sol­vency has in­creased the im­pe­tus for claimants to seek an ar­bi­tra­tion award quickly, where this is an op­tion.”</p>
    <p>Lawyer Peter Ong Lip Cheng, who runs his own firm, Peter Ong Law, and is on the panel of the Law So­ci­ety Ar­bi­tra­tion Scheme, said ef­fi­ciency con­cerns will drive more to seek ar­bi­tra­tion, where suit­able.</p>
    <p>Lon­don-based bar­ris­ter Si­mon Milnes, who used to com­mute reg­u­larly to Sin­ga­pore be­fore Covid-19, said: “So far, ar­bi­tral hear­ing ac­tiv­ity in Sin­ga­pore re­mains brisk, as it does in Lon­don. The ex­pe­ri­ence of the 2008 crash and the 2014 oil price col­lapse sug­gests that such volatil­ity does cause an over­all surge in dis­putes, es­pe­cially through mar­ket-driven de­faults, even though some com­pa­nies find they lack the re­sources to pur­sue de­fault­ing coun­ter­par­ties.”</p>
    <p>He added that Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess rests on four cru­cial pil­lars – its neu­tral­ity, anti-cor­rup­tion cul­ture, a di­verse and dy­namic le­gal pro­fes­sion, and a ju­di­ciary that un­der­stands and sup­ports ar­bi­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“This is why I be­lieve Sin­ga­pore will re­tain – and even grow – its edge over ri­val cen­tres. It is hard to repli­cate even one of those four fac­tors, let alone all four at once. With­out them, an ar­bi­tra­tion in­sti­tu­tion, how­ever good in it­self, can­not grow into a thriv­ing hub,” he said.</p>
