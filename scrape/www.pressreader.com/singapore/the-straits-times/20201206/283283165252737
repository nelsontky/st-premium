    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Arse­nal man­ager Mikel Arteta has said Tot­ten­ham de­serve their place at the top of the Premier League ta­ble but it is too early to call them gen­uine ti­tle con­tenders.</p>
    <p>Jose Mour­inho’s Spurs have not suf­fered a de­feat in the league since the sea­son’s open­ing week­end and have the chance to move 11 points clear of their north Lon­don ri­vals Arse­nal when they meet to­day.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s very early in the sea­son to see who is ti­tle con­tenders or not,” Arteta told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“But what you can say is that they (Spurs) are in the po­si­tion they are be­cause they are do­ing things the right way.”</p>
    <p>Arse­nal, in con­trast, have strug­gled for con­sis­tency and sit 14th in the ta­ble, while their tally of 13 points is their low­est af­ter their open­ing 10 matches of any league cam­paign since the 1981-82 sea­son.</p>
    <p>“The ta­ble is like that be­cause they de­serve it more than us and they’ve done things bet­ter than us,” Arteta added.</p>
    <p>“We have to ac­cept that. But we want to go there and make that gap three points smaller.”</p>
    <p>Lon­don has been placed un­der Tier 2 Covid-19 re­stric­tions by the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment, paving the way for a re­turn of 2,000 fans to the Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur Sta­dium for the first time since March.</p>
    <p>Arteta is hop­ing his play­ers can feed off the at­mos­phere too.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been wait­ing for this mo­ment for a long time and I’m not go­ing to com­plain,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I’d rather play in a sta­dium with an at­mos­phere, with some fans... at this mo­ment it’s go­ing to be for them with their sup­port­ers and the next week it will be us.”</p>
    <p>The Arse­nal boss also con­firmed that mid­fielder Thomas Partey, who has been out since he picked up an in­jury against As­ton Villa last month, is back in train­ing and in</p>
    <p>con­tention for the match.</p>
    <p>Ni­co­las Pepe, mean­while, will serve the se­cond of his three­match ban fol­low­ing his red card against Leeds United last month.</p>
    <p>As Arse­nal – win­less in their last three l eague games – hope to bounce back, pun­dit Jamie Red­knapp has urged Spurs not to adopt their prag­matic style of play and at­tack the strug­gling Gun­ners.</p>
    <p>“If it was a full house (at the sta­dium) they’d de­mand them to go</p>
    <p>for­ward... the fans want to see good foot­ball, they’ve been used to it over the years,” he told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>“If Harry Kane and Son He­ung­min want to play and have a go, it doesn’t mat­ter what the man­ager says... I think they will have a go at this Arse­nal team be­cause of how they’re strug­gling them­selves.”</p>
    <p>The odds may be in Tot­ten­ham’s favour but Mour­inho has also said his team will not need to be warned about com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery­body knows what Arse­nal did re­cently, the way they beat Chelsea (in the fi­nal) and (Manch­ester) City (in the semis) to win the FA Cup,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The way they played in Liver­pool in spite of de­feat, the way they beat (Manch­ester) United at Old Traf­ford, the way they nor­mally play against the top teams.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think I need to (warn the play­ers about com­pla­cency).”</p>
    <p>Spurs had a num­ber of in­jury con</p>
    <p>cerns ear­lier this week, most sig­nif­i­cantly over their star striker Kane.</p>
    <p>But Mour­inho has said that the 27-year-old is “go­ing to be fit”, while Erik Lamela is still out on the sidelines and Toby Alder­weireld re­mains a doubt fol­low­ing a groin prob­lem.</p>
