    <p>V. Yuo­gan has had more than his fair share of per­sonal tragedy.</p>
    <p>His mother died from com­pli­ca­tions due to di­a­betes when he was just five. For the past 11 years, he has lived at the Ra­makr­ishna Mis­sion Boys’ Home Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>And he has been deaf since birth. Through a sign lan­guage in­ter­preter, the 22-year-old told The Straits Times: “I re­mem­ber hug­ging my mother (be­fore she died) and cry­ing. I have a photo of her and I keep it with me in the home. I keep her in my heart.”</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle else he re­calls of his life be­fore she died.</p>
    <p>One happy mem­ory is of a birth­day when his par­ents in­vited rel­a­tives to their house for a party.</p>
    <p>Af­ter her death, how­ever, his fa­ther, a se­cu­rity guard, sold their three-room flat in Yishun.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuo­gan said his fa­ther would then leave him at a dif­fer­ent friend’s house ev­ery night while he slept at his work­place.</p>
    <p>In 2009, at age 11, Mr Yuo­gan ar­rived at the home, which shel­ters chil­dren and young per­sons who are abused or ne­glected, deemed be­yond parental con­trol, in con­flict with the law or from dys­func­tional fam­i­lies. He does not know why he was sent there.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther suf­fered a stroke three years later and is now cared for in a nurs­ing home. The 56-year-old also suf­fers from vas­cu­lar de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>So­cial work­ers at the home re­call Mr Yuo­gan as a pa­tient child who did not chafe at the hard hand life had dealt him.</p>
    <p>When the other boys could not un­der­stand his sign­ing, he gave them sign lan­guage al­pha­bet cards so they could learn how to com­mu­ni­cate with him. Now, he chats with his friends mainly through text mes­sages, ges­tures or lip-read­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Am­rita Das, a so­cial worker at the home, said he is “help­ful and re­silient”.</p>
    <p>“He works well with the staff of the home to over­come the chal­lenges that he en­coun­ters. He has also been able to com­plete aca­demic mile­stones with the guid­ance and mo­ti­va­tion he re­ceives at the home,” said Ms Das.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuo­gan is cur­rently do­ing a higher Nitec course in in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy sys­tems and net­works at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) Col­lege East, hav­ing al­ready com­pleted a Nitec course in fa­cil­ity tech­nol­ogy (air-con­di­tion­ing and re­frig­er­a­tion).</p>
    <p>He said: “I chose th­ese cour­ses be­cause I feel that th­ese ar­eas will al­ways be in de­mand. I also wanted to gain ex­pe­ri­ence and feel con­fi­dent.”</p>
    <p>Chal­lenges, how­ever, re­main. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April and May, schools were closed and stu­dents had to en­gage in home-based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>IT sys­tems and net­works lec­turer at ITE Col­lege East An­drew Ng said: “The In­ter­net ac­cess at the boys’ home is lim­ited and Yuo­gan does not have a pow­er­ful lap­top, which is re­quired to com­plete his school­work.”</p>
    <p>Although the school loaned him a lap­top and pro­vided him with a pre­paid card that pro­vided ac­cess, dis­rup­tions still oc­curred.</p>
    <p>But Mr Yuo­gan did not give up. Said Mr Ng: “He tried his best to catch up on what he missed when he re­turned to school.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng added that Mr Yuo­gan also helps oth­ers when they have trou­ble with les­son mod­ules, and his class­mates can “em­u­late his de­ter­mi­na­tion to learn and will­ing­ness to help”.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has changed life for Mr Yuo­gan in other ways as well.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, he chooses not to visit his fa­ther at the nurs­ing home.</p>
    <p>The Manch­ester United fan is also part of the ITE Col­lege East foot­ball team and a mem­ber of the Deaf Sports As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) Fut­sal team, but he is un­able to play as train­ing has been halted.</p>
    <p>Now, on week­ends, he gets on his bike and earns some ex­tra money as a part-time de­liv­ery rider for GrabFood.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuo­gan re­ceives help from var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies and com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions. For ex­am­ple, he gets a bur­sary and pocket money from the Ra­makr­ishna home.</p>
    <p>He also re­ceives the Higher Ed­u­ca­tion Com­mu­nity Bur­sary, a Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion ini­tia­tive, and the Glax­oSmithK­line-Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board Study Grant.</p>
    <p>His dream is to get mar­ried one day and own a home.</p>
    <p>The hard­ships he has en­dured and the loss of his mother – which can still make him weep – push him to do bet­ter, he said.</p>
    <p>“De­spite all that has hap­pened, I need to be strong, I want to do well in life and make my par­ents proud.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter he grad­u­ates from his Nitec course in 2022, he wants to go on to a diploma and then a de­gree.</p>
    <p>He en­vis­ages own­ing his own com­pany ser­vic­ing air-con­di­tion­ers, and in­tends to em­ploy peo­ple who have hear­ing dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“I want to prove to the world that peo­ple who are deaf can achieve their goals.”</p>
    <p>Over­com­ing ob­sta­cles with a vi­sion to suc­ceed</p>
