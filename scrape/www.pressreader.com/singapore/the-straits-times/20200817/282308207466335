    <p>LIS­BON • Only once in their his­tory have Lyon ever made to the Cham­pi­ons League semi-fi­nals and that 2010 team are com­pletely un­recog­nis­able to the one to­day.</p>
    <p>The French Ligue 1 side are in un­charted ter­ri­tory, but hav­ing de­feated Ju­ven­tus and now Manch­ester City, they are “not set­ting any lim­its” as a first tro­phy in Europe beck­ons.</p>
    <p>In their way, just like in 2010, stand heavy­weights and five-time cham­pi­ons Bay­ern Mu­nich in Lis­bon on Wednesday.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the favourites tag no longer has the same ring to it this year, with no English or Span­ish sides in the semi-fi­nals for the first time since 1996.</p>
    <p>Three of the four re­main­ing teams have never won the Cham­pi­ons League, and after their sur­prise run, Lyon are gun­ning for their maiden ap­pear­ance in a ma­jor Euro­pean fi­nal against all the odds.</p>
    <p>“We know who we are com­ing up against next,” said coach Rudi Gar­cia, whose side scored via Maxwel Cor­net and a dou­ble by sub­sti­tute Moussa Dem­bele. City, who replied through Kevin de Bruyne, now have just a draw and two losses against Lyon in three meet­ings.</p>
    <p>“We elim­i­nated a Ju­ven­tus side who were one of the con­tenders to win the Cham­pi­ons League, and a Manch­ester City side who were con­tenders to win the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>“Bay­ern will be ex­actly the same, but on the ba­sis of what the play­ers have shown log­i­cally, we can still hope to get through an­other round and that is what we are go­ing to pre­pare to try to do.</p>
    <p>“When you are in the last four, we can say that we de­serve to be there and if we get to the fi­nal, we re­ally will de­serve it.</p>
    <p>“Tonight is mag­nif­i­cent, but it doesn’t give us any­thing, there is no ti­tle or place in Europe.”</p>
    <p>While some blame can be at­trib­uted to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic after the Ligue 1 sea­son was axed early, Lyon’s sev­enth-placed fin­ish means they must win the Cham­pi­ons League just to play in Europe again next cam­paign.</p>
    <p>At stake is 23 suc­ces­sive sea­sons of con­ti­nen­tal foot­ball, and pride is driv­ing on France’s sec­ond-rich­est team, who were run­ners-up to semi-fi­nal­ists RB Leipzig in the group phase.</p>
    <p>In­ad­ver­tently, not play­ing com­pet­i­tive foot­ball for nearly five months has helped them. The City clash was just their third game since March but Gar­cia re­vealed that he used the break to work closely with his play­ers.</p>
    <p>“We adapted to the sus­pen­sion of Ligue 1, we had eight weeks of pre­sea­son, it’s mas­sive,” the French­man said. “Our fit­ness coach re­ally came up with the per­fect so­lu­tion for our play­ers.”</p>
    <p>For the 56-year-old, his team’s pro­gres­sion is win­ning over sup­port­ers un­happy over his Mar­seille links.</p>
    <p>Lyon pres­i­dent Jean-Michel Au­las, who took some flak last Oc­to­ber for ap­point­ing a coach who had man­aged one of their fiercest ri­vals after Sylv­inho was fired, be­lieves his de­ci­sion has been vin­di­cated.</p>
    <p>“We have a tal­ented team. Gar­cia is a boy who does his job well. We had iden­ti­fied him to straighten out Lyon.</p>
    <p>“He knew with hu­mil­ity, and some­times dif­fi­cul­ties, to do his work,” he told RMC Sport.</p>
    <p>“It is a con­fir­ma­tion for me, he de­serves the recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers have seized on this in­jus­tice which nailed us to sev­enth place (in Ligue 1).”</p>
