    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has seen gov­ern­ments around the world un­leash un­prece­dented fis­cal fire­power to save jobs and help work­ers. But amid calls for the state to play a larger role, size is not all that mat­ters – there must be a new so­cial com­pact that di­rects mar­kets and em­pow­ers com­mu­ni­ties to­wards pub­lic goals, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shanmugara­tnam.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at a vir­tual dis­cus­sion or­gan­ised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Policy (LKYSPP) yesterday, titled “After the pan­demic – the re­birth of big gov­ern­ment? State ca­pac­ity, trust and pri­vacy in the post-Covid-19 era”.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies, was joined by Bloomberg editor-inchief John Mick­leth­wait and Fi­nan­cial Times global busi­ness colum­nist Rana Foroohar at the ses­sion, which was mod­er­ated by LKYSPP as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of prac­tice James Crab­tree. Mr Thar­man said that nav­i­gat­ing the post-Covid-19 world re­quires “a cer­tain ac­tivism” on the part of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing back to large states per se, but we do have to go back to... a sense of moral pur­pose in gov­ern­ment, hav­ing the con­fi­dence to con­vince the pop­u­la­tion that th­ese are the right things to do – and we are all go­ing to have to or­gan­ise our­selves to­gether to achieve it – and an abil­ity to fo­cus the re­sources of the state on what mat­ters most, rather than ev­ery­thing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So, you don’t nec­es­sar­ily have to be very large, but you have to be very good at the most im­por­tant things you should be do­ing, and go about it with the spirit of an ac­tivist.”</p>
    <p>One of the most im­por­tant pri­or­i­ties in both ad­vanced as well as emerg­ing economies, he said, is to re-cen­tre gov­ern­ment and fis­cal policy on the pro­vi­sion of key pub­lic goods such as health­care and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The highly un­equal state of ed­u­ca­tion in the world, from the qual­ity of school in­fra­struc­ture to the stan­dards of teach­ers, has been a fun­da­men­tal fail­ing in the bid to achieve in­clu­sive growth, he added.</p>
    <p>“So, if you fo­cus on pub­lic goods and try and do it well, and you try and lever­age on the en­er­gies of the pri­vate sec­tor and com­mu­ni­ties, you have an ef­fec­tive state.”</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man said that this also raises the is­sue of fair­ness, such as who pays for the costs and who gets the ben­e­fits. While gov­ern­ments will have to get more pro­gres­sive, he cau­tioned against think­ing that they can sim­ply bor­row more and more. “At some point, there is a con­straint and bur­den that debt ex­erts on growth.”</p>
    <p>The dra­matic re­duc­tion in the level of debt as a per­cent­age of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct i n the United States and United King­dom after World War II, he said, was only be­cause of rapid and sus­tained real growth, which is no longer avail­able, and high in­fla­tion, a solution that is no longer ac­cept­able as pop­u­la­tions get older. “There is a se­ri­ous is­sue of stag­na­tion of pro­duc­tiv­ity growth, and the dy­namism of most mar­ket economies has been lost and needs to be re­gained.”</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Bloomberg’s Mr Mick­leth­wait said that “mag­i­cal money” will even­tu­ally run out.</p>
    <p>“If you look at the prob­lems of West­ern gov­ern­ment, many of them come from over­load­ing the state, rather than there be­ing not enough of it. There has to be reform, whereby the state is tar­geted much more to­wards those who need it,” said Mr Mick­leth­wait.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man pointed out that while Sin­ga­pore does not have a large gov­ern­ment, it is a highly pro­gres­sive one in terms of its so­cial se­cu­rity sys­tem, health­care and ed­u­ca­tion. “And I think it will get a lit­tle more that way in the years to come.”</p>
    <p>In this re­gard, more con­tri­bu­tions will have to come from those who are bet­ter off and wealth­ier, he said. “Ev­ery­one should con­trib­ute some­thing more as so­ci­eties get older, but fair­ness dic­tates that things have to stack up in favour of the poor and mid­dle-in­come.”</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on the need for un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance, he said such schemes, which could also be un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits fi­nanced out of taxes, would ap­ply to so­ci­eties with high struc­tural un­em­ploy­ment. “All th­ese are schemes that we will have to con­sider if we face a sit­u­a­tion like many other ad­vanced coun­tries face, where there is a large num­ber of peo­ple who are un­em­ployed for a long pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore does not need this yet as its un­em­ploy­ment rate is low, and the Gov­ern­ment is able to get peo­ple back into jobs quickly, he said. “It is go­ing to get more dif­fi­cult in the next six to 12 months. And that is why we are work­ing in­ten­sively to reskill peo­ple, put them back into firms on trainee­ships or at­tach­ments – even if they don’t yet have a per­ma­nent job – and try to make that a path­way to a new per­ma­nent job.”</p>
    <p>The SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age an­nounced in May aims to sup­port close to 100,000 job seek­ers this year by cre­at­ing new po­si­tions, trainee­ships and skills train­ing places. Mr Thar­man chairs the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil, which over­sees the de­sign and im­ple­men­ta­tion of the pack­age.</p>
    <p>He said forg­ing a new com­pact re­quires a cul­ture of col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity. It also means aban­don­ing old ways of think­ing – such as the be­lief that those who fare poorly are not do­ing enough for them­selves, or that the state is not help­ing.</p>
    <p>“Both those ways of look­ing at so­ci­ety are get­ting very tired and have also lost their ap­peal. Cer­tainly, we haven’t seen a sudden surge of ir­re­spon­si­bil­ity on the part of peo­ple that can ex­plain why wages have been stag­nant for three decades,” he said.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, the old sys­tem of re­dis­tri­bu­tion... was too much about com­pen­sat­ing those who have lost out, and not enough about help­ing peo­ple to re­grow and re­gen­er­ate com­mu­ni­ties, towns and in­di­vid­u­als, and em­pow­er­ing net­works of peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>He noted one pos­i­tive thing that has emerged from the pan­demic is a greater recog­ni­tion of the role that or­di­nary es­sen­tial work­ers play.</p>
    <p>“Those who are do­ing some of the tough­est jobs are now get­ting a lot more re­spect. There is a sense in so­ci­ety that we have many silent heroes among us, and they are not al­ways the peo­ple with the best qual­i­fi­ca­tions or ‘top’ jobs,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, you need a cri­sis to re­fo­cus on the fun­da­men­tals. So­cial com­pacts make for a bet­ter fu­ture for ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>SPIRIT OF AC­TIVISM</p>
    <p>We are not go­ing back to large states per se, but we do have to go back to... a sense of moral pur­pose in gov­ern­ment, hav­ing the con­fi­dence to con­vince the pop­u­la­tion that th­ese are the right things to do – and we are all go­ing to have to or­gan­ise our­selves to­gether to achieve it – and an abil­ity to fo­cus the re­sources of the state on what mat­ters most, rather than ev­ery­thing... So, you don’t nec­es­sar­ily have to be very large, but you have to be very good at the most im­por­tant things you should be do­ing, and go about it with the spirit of an ac­tivist.</p>
    <p>’’ SE­NIOR MIN­IS­TER THAR­MAN SHANMUGARA­TNAM, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies, on how nav­i­gat­ing the post-Covid-19 world re­quires “a cer­tain ac­tivism” on the part of gov­ern­ment.</p>
