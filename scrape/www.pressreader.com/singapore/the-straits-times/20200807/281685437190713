    <p>The Philip­pines is now the new epi­cen­tre of the coro­n­avirus pandemic in South-east Asia, even as it plunges into a re­ces­sion with no hope of a swift re­cov­ery as a crip­pling lock­down con­tin­ues to wipe out jobs and in­comes.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry yes­ter­day re­ported 3,561 new cases of Covid-19, rais­ing the to­tal to 119,460. It sur­passes In­done­sia’s tally of 118,753, which till now had been the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the death toll in In­done­sia stands at 5,521 against the Philip­pines’ 2,150.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines now has the fourth-most num­ber of cases in Asia, af­ter In­dia, Pak­istan and Bangladesh. The lat­est fig­ures came just hours af­ter it was re­ported that the econ­omy suf­fered its deep­est slump on record in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines reached this grim mile­stone even though it had in place one of the strictest and longest lock­downs in the world.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte placed Metropoli­tan Manila and the rest of the main is­land of Lu­zon – home to about half of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion of over 107 mil­lion</p>
    <p>– un­der lock­down in mid-March to slow the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials said the strict shel­ter-at-home re­stric­tions al­lowed the coun­try to “bend the curve”, with in­fec­tions hov­er­ing at an av­er­age 200 to 500.</p>
    <p>With cases seem­ing to have be­come man­age­able and hospi­tals free­ing up more beds, Mr Duterte lifted the lock­down on June 1.</p>
    <p>Since then, how­ever, cases have soared. Over 75,000 cases were recorded in June and July alone. In re­cent days, hospi­tals have run out of beds as they are swamped with Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, some 80 groups rep­re­sent­ing 80,000 doc­tors and one mil­lion nurses said the Philip­pines was los­ing the fight against the disease. That forced Mr Duterte to put Metro Manila and four out­ly­ing prov­inces back un­der lock­down for at least two weeks start­ing from Tues­day.</p>
    <p>For­mer health min­is­ter Manuel Dayrit said he was not sur­prised that the Philip­pines would be sad­dled with the most num­ber of Covid-19 cases in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“If you look at South-east Asia, what you need to un­der­stand is that we have to look at the readi­ness of their health sys­tems, even pre-Covid,” he said.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam and Thai­land, for in­stance, dou­bled or tripled their in­vest­ments in their health sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines, by com­par­i­son, had a “pretty ob­so­lete” pub­lic health in­fras­truc­ture when the coro­n­avirus be­gan sweep­ing across the globe, he added.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, the statis­tics bureau re­ported that the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) – the broad­est mea­sure of goods and ser­vices pro­duced – shrank 16.5 per cent in the April-June quar­ter from a year ear­lier, the big­gest con­trac­tion in 40 years.</p>
    <p>GDP de­clined for a sec­ond con­sec­u­tive quar­ter on a quar­ter-on-quar­ter ba­sis, down 15.2 per cent, im­ply­ing the econ­omy was now in re­ces­sion for the first time in 29 years.</p>
    <p>Na­tional statis­ti­cian Claire Den­nis Mapa told re­porters yes­ter­day: “We’re see­ing these num­bers be­cause of the (two-month) lock­down (from mid-March).”</p>
    <p>At least three mil­lion peo­ple lost their jobs dur­ing this pe­riod and gov­ern­ment economists es­ti­mated that the lock­down cost the econ­omy roughly 1.5 tril­lion pe­sos (S$42 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>At a news brief­ing yes­ter­day, Eco­nomic Plan­ning Sec­re­tary Karl Chua said that with in­fec­tions surg­ing in March, it was in­evitable the econ­omy would take a hit, adding: “Our coun­try is fac­ing its big­gest cri­sis in nearly eight decades.”</p>
    <p>There is some hope. Man­u­fac­tur­ing had be­gun to ease, from 39 per cent in April to 19 per cent in June, noted Fi­nance Sec­re­tary Car­los Dominguez, but ex­ports to China are grow­ing – 2.8 per cent in June af­ter shrink­ing 55 per cent in April.</p>
    <p>POOR HEALTH IN­FRAS­TRUC­TURE</p>
    <p>If you look at South-east Asia, what you need to un­der­stand is that we have to look at the readi­ness of their health sys­tems, even pre-Covid.</p>
