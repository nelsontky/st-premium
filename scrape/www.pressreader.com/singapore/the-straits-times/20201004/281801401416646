    <p>A Sin­ga­porean man, who left for Malaysia when he was about a year old, even­tu­ally re­turned to serve his na­tional ser­vice in 2018.</p>
    <p>By then, Basil Lim Boon Hoh, 28, had de­faulted on his NS obli­ga­tions for al­most 10 years.</p>
    <p>Lim, who also has Malaysian cit­i­zen­ship, pleaded guilty on Thurs­day to two charges un­der the En­list­ment Act.</p>
    <p>Two other sim­i­lar charges will be taken into ac­count dur­ing his sen­tenc­ing, ex­pected to be on Oct 15.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Lim had re­mained out­side of Sin­ga­pore with­out a valid exit per­mit for a to­tal of nine years, 11 months and 16 days.</p>
    <p>His mother is a Malaysian, while his fa­ther, with whom he is no longer in con­tact, is a Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Lim is Sin­ga­porean by birth but left for Malaysia when he was about a year old.</p>
    <p>While he was granted Malaysian cit­i­zen­ship in 2001, his mother still</p>
    <p>ap­plied for a Sin­ga­pore NRIC on his be­half in 2007 be­cause she wanted him to have a choice in the fu­ture, court doc­u­ments state.</p>
    <p>Lim’s fa­ther in­formed him of his NS obli­ga­tions be­fore he turned 10.</p>
    <p>But his mother told him when he was 16 that he could ig­nore these obli­ga­tions as he had Malaysian cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that two no­tices were sent in 2009 to a Malaysian ad­dress that Lim’s mother had pro­vided to the Cen­tral Man­power Base (CMPB).</p>
    <p>One re­quired him to reg­is­ter on­line for his NS, while the other in­formed him that he had to re­port at CMPB. Lim failed to do both.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Lim’s lawyer wrote to CPMB ask­ing for his client to be al­lowed to re­nounce his Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship. This was re­jected.</p>
    <p>Lim re­turned to Sin­ga­pore i n March 2018 and en­listed in Au­gust that year. He com­pleted his NS in Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Lim now wants to keep his Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship as he does not speak Malay well and in­tends to work here.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Sean Teh urged the court to jail Lim for five months and 18 days, ar­gu­ing that Lim had re­ported to CMPB at his own tim­ing.</p>
    <p>His sur­ren­der was there­fore “tac­ti­cal and cal­cu­lated”, and not out of “gen­uine re­morse”, the DPP said.</p>
    <p>Quot­ing Lim’s mother in his mit­i­ga­tion plea, de­fence lawyer Lim Kia Tong said she had pro­vided CMPB with the ad­dress of a pre­vi­ous home in Malaysia and did not re­ceive any phys­i­cal let­ters on her son’s NS obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>She also hid this from Lim as she did not want him to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, the lawyer added.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of De­fence pre­vi­ously said that 14 NS de­fault­ers have been jailed since the High Court set out a sen­tenc­ing frame­work for such de­fault­ers in 2017.</p>
