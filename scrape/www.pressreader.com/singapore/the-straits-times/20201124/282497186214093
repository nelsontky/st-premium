    <p>Air­fares have gone into free fall since the pan­demic out­break early this year, with some fares up to half off.</p>
    <p>But they may not stay de­pressed for long as pos­i­tive news of vac­cines have been emerg­ing.</p>
    <p>Skyscan­ner re­vealed that Bangkok, Bali, Kuala Lumpur, Taipei and Seoul – these were Sin­ga­pore’s top five searches for des­ti­na­tions in 2018/19 – saw plum­met­ing fares for Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>Bangkok saw the steep­est fall of 51 per cent (see ta­ble).</p>
    <p>In­dus­try in­sid­ers point out that air­lines, when faced with ex­cess ca­pac­ity, tweak their fare struc­tures down­wards. In ad­di­tion, some air­lines al­lo­cate more seats to the lower-fare types to soak up ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>These come to­gether to cre­ate a fare bo­nanza and higher avail­abil­ity of cheap tick­ets.</p>
    <p>But the fares are dy­namic and can spike eas­ily when de­mand goes up and fare al­go­rithms kick in.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Skyscan­ner ob­served that when news of the Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong air travel bub­ble was first re­leased on Oct 12, searches on its plat­form shot up 2,700 per cent com­pared with the pre­vi­ous week.</p>
    <p>News emerged that some avid trav­ellers even pur­chased tick­ets in ad­vance, in­tend­ing to change travel dates if nec­es­sary when more de­tails of the air travel bub­ble were avail­able.</p>
    <p>When the full de­tails were an­nounced a month later, SIA’s econ­omy fares tripled on des­ig­nated flights with the cheap­est fares rapidly snapped up.</p>
    <p>Some flights were sold out within hours.</p>
    <p>“The pent-up de­mand will cause air­fares to swing up when travel re­stric­tions ease.</p>
    <p>“Cou­pled with the l ow fares to­day, prices can read­just 20 per cent to 40 per cent rapidly. De­mand can dou­ble, but flight sched­ules can’t change overnight,” says a flight plan­ner for an Asian car­rier, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>The post­pone­ment of the Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong travel bub­ble has dis­ap­pointed many.</p>
    <p>Yet, trav­ellers grit their teeth and grip their pass­port, re­main hope­ful and are still rar­ing to go.</p>
    <p>A quick check on SIA’s web­site on Sun­day showed no spate of can­cel­la­tions, with next month’s flights fully taken up by prior book­ings and those who have resched­uled due to the news. Even fares for Jan­uary next year are still at least 20 per cent higher than pre­travel bub­ble fares.</p>
    <p>Of greater im­pact is the hope­d­for vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ments are gath­er­ing mo­men­tum, since the break­ing news on Nov 9 of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vac­cine, fol­lowed a week later by an­other vac­cine an­nounce­ment by Moderna.</p>
    <p>Ex­pect­ing a travel re­vival, eq­uity in­vestors quickly piled on air­lines’ stocks – SIA’s share price soared as much as 21 per cent dur­ing in­tra­day trad­ing on Nov 9.</p>
    <p>Since then, searches for next year’s spring and sum­mer travel have soared.</p>
    <p>“Our data shows a 19 per cent week-on-week in­crease in all searches from Sin­ga­pore for travel be­tween April 1 and Aug 31 next year, show­ing there is pent-up ap­petite for Sin­ga­pore­ans to get ex­plor­ing again,” notes Ms Jo McClin­tock, Skyscan­ner’s se­nior global brand di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>So, it is time to start plan­ning now as fares can only trend up.</p>
