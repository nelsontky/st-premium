    <p>Dur­ing Ja­maican sprinter Usain Bolt’s world-record 100m sprint in 2009, his mind was able to slow down dur­ing those 9.58 sec­onds and an­a­lyse them frame by frame.</p>
    <p>He tells The Straits Times how he does this, why he thinks track and field is a ne­glected sport and which sport he is cur­rently strug­gling with.</p>
    <p>1. He can slow down time in his head</p>
    <p>Bolt, 33, is fea­tured in an episode of Great­ness Code, a new short-form doc­u­men­tary se­ries on Ap­ple TV+ that asks seven of the world’s top ath­letes to pull back the cur­tain on a ca­reer-defin­ing mo­ment.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers spot­lighted in­clude bas­ket­ball star LeBron James, cham­pion swim­mer Katie Ledecky and leg­endary surfer Kelly Slater.</p>
    <p>Bolt shares that although races such as his 100m sprint at the 2009 World Cham­pi­onships in Ber­lin took just sec­onds – 9.58, in that case – “for me, it’s re­ally slow, it’s like a cam­era, it breaks down frame by frame in my head”.</p>
    <p>“My mind is tak­ing men­tal flashes of cer­tain mo­ments of the race – if I make a mis­take or if I ex­e­cute it right.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to ST by video call from his home in Ja­maica last week, the re­tired ath­lete ex­plains how he does this. “For me, it’s the in­ten­sity that re­ally helps me to slow time down, be­cause I need to know ex­actly what I need to do to win in that mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause if some­one is lead­ing me, I need to tell my­self to go faster, be more tech­ni­cal – stuff like that.”</p>
    <p>2. He feels fans do not re­ally care about track and field</p>
    <p>Be­fore he re­tired in 2017, Bolt was the undis­puted star of the sport, win­ning three gold medals at the 2008 Olympics in Bei­jing, three at the 2012 London games, and set­ting world records for the 100m, 200m and 4x100m re­lay.</p>
    <p>He was its big­gest show­man, with his trade­mark “light­ning bolt” pose, dance moves and gi­ant per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to per­form and I wanted peo­ple to see me be­cause I feel like if you paid to come see me, or if you were watch­ing on tele­vi­sion, you should re­ally en­joy the per­for­mance,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause a hun­dred me­tres is re­ally quick and I wanted ev­ery­body to see who I am as a per­son.”</p>
    <p>But in­ter­est in the sport has waned since he re­tired.</p>
    <p>“When I got into the sport and be­fore I started do­ing well, it wasn’t well spon­sored be­cause a lot of peo­ple don’t pay at­ten­tion to track and field – it was only when I started win­ning that more peo­ple came in.”</p>
    <p>“And I think or­gan­i­sa­tions like the IAAF (In­ter­na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Ath­let­ics Fed­er­a­tions, re­named last year to World Ath­let­ics) can do a bet­ter job to re­ally make it a lit­tle bit more ex­cit­ing for the fans,” he says.</p>
    <p>For me, it’s re­ally slow, it’s like a cam­era, it breaks down frame by frame in my head... My mind is tak­ing men­tal flashes of cer­tain mo­ments of the race – if I make a mis­take or if I ex­e­cute it right. ’’ USAIN BOLT, on his short but in­tense sprints</p>
    <p>3. Bolt says raw sport­ing tal­ent is not enough</p>
    <p>What makes an ath­lete ex­cep­tional, he says, is “want­ing it and work­ing for it”.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause if we didn’t work on our tal­ent or our craft, then we wouldn’t be here. So it’s all about ded­i­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Asked what he hopes his le­gacy will be, Bolt says: “My aim was al­ways just to be one of the greats and to be the best role model I could be.”</p>
    <p>4. He just be­came a fa­ther – to a Light­ning Bolt</p>
    <p>Bolt and his long-time girl­friend, 30-year-old Ja­maican model Kasi Ben­nett, be­came first-time par­ents in May. And last week, the ath­lete shared the first pub­lic pho­to­graph of the adorable baby girl on In­sta­gram and fi­nally re­vealed her name: Olympia Light­ning Bolt.</p>
    <p>Be­ing a par­ent has led to some sleep­less nights for the star, but he is lov­ing it.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing a dad is fairly new, but I’m re­ally en­joy­ing watch­ing my daugh­ter grow at this young age and see­ing my­self in her.”</p>
    <p>5. He finds cy­cling hard</p>
    <p>It has been three years since he com­peted, but Bolt is still in shape.</p>
    <p>“I go to the gym and just do a nor­mal work­out. I try not to do too much, just some back ex­er­cises and a lit­tle bit of weights.”</p>
    <p>“And I re­cently picked up cy­cling, which is very hard,” he says with a laugh. “It’s the hills – get­ting over the hills and rid­ing 10 miles (16km) is no joke. I have a new-found re­spect for cy­clists.”</p>
