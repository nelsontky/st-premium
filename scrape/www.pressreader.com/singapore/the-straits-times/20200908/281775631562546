    <p>Six months af­ter en­forc­ing some of the world’s long­est and strictest quar­an­tine re­stric­tions, the Philip­pines is see­ing signs that the Covid-19 out­break in its cap­i­tal Manila is fi­nally be­ing con­tained.</p>
    <p>“We’ve ac­tu­ally flat­tened (the curve),” Pro­fes­sor Guido David, head of the Univer­sity of the Philip­pines’ Octa Re­search Team, told CNN Philip­pines last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to in­di­ca­tions that the spread of the coro­n­avirus was slow­ing down.</p>
    <p>Though the same num­ber of peo­ple might be get­ting sick, in­fec­tions ap­pear to be hap­pen­ing over a longer span of time, al­low­ing hos­pi­tals time and re­sources to treat in­com­ing Covid-19 pa­tients with­out get­ting over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Prof David said the re­pro­duc­tion num­ber of the virus in the cap­i­tal, which had the high­est num­ber of in­fec­tions in the coun­try, had fallen to less than one and was de­creas­ing, calling this “a good sign”.</p>
    <p>The re­pro­duc­tion num­ber is an in­di­ca­tor of how con­ta­gious a dis­ease is, or how eas­ily it spreads from per­son to per­son in a com­mu­nity. Gov­ern­ments use it as a proxy for de­ter­min­ing whether Covid-19 out­breaks are grow­ing, shrink­ing or hold­ing steady, and gen­er­ally, a fig­ure lower than one is a good sign.</p>
    <p>Prof David said the so-called pos­i­tiv­ity rate was also go­ing down. “We were av­er­ag­ing more than 4,000 cases (a day) from mid- to late-Au­gust (for the whole county). Now, we’re av­er­ag­ing 3,000.”</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials recorded over 130,000 in­fec­tions last month, rep­re­sent­ing more than a third of the coun­try’s recorded tally of 237,365.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines still has the high­est num­ber of recorded Covid-19 cases in South-east Asia. About 48,000 are still ac­tive cases. Around 17,000 new cases have been recorded so far this month.</p>
    <p>Health Un­der­sec­re­tary Maria Rosario Vergeire said yes­ter­day that while cur­rent in­di­ca­tors showed im­prove­ments, “we al­ways say noth­ing is cer­tain at this point”.</p>
    <p>“We can say that our strate­gies are work­ing, al­though it’s not im­me­di­ate. We can see that we are de­con­gest­ing our hos­pi­tals,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Vergeire said only 66 per cent of hos­pi­tal beds in Manila were oc­cu­pied, from a high of about 80 per cent last month.</p>
    <p>Prof David said the two-week lock­down early last month was a “big fac­tor” for the fall­ing num­bers.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte reim­posed quar­an­tine mea­sures in the cap­i­tal and four nearby prov­inces – home to some 27 mil­lion or a quar­ter of the Philip­pine pop­u­la­tion – from Aug 4 to 18 af­ter over 160 med­i­cal groups warned the health sys­tem was on the verge of col­laps­ing.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines went through one of the long­est shel­ter-at-home lock­downs in the world from midMarch to May. But since emerg­ing from that sweep­ing lock­down on June 1, con­firmed in­fec­tions in the coun­try had surged past 200,000.</p>
    <p>Now, curbs have been eased once again. Most busi­nesses, in­clud­ing dine-in services, have been al­lowed to re­sume. Religious services are also back, pro­vided that houses of wor­ship limit to­tal at­ten­dance to 30 per cent of a build­ing’s ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing hours for malls have been ex­tended. Fit­ness gyms, bar­ber shops and In­ter­net cafes are al­lowed to re­open par­tially – at 30 per cent of their ca­pac­ity .</p>
    <p>But Prof David said it was too early to rule out an­other surge. “It doesn’t mean our prob­lem is solved. It doesn’t mean the pan­demic is over,” he said. “The virus is still here. We’re still get­ting around 3,000 cases per day and we have to sus­tain our mo­men­tum. So we have to keep do­ing the right things and not fal­ter.”</p>
    <p>He added that Covid-19 cases in the Philip­pines could still cross 300,000 by the end of the month.</p>
