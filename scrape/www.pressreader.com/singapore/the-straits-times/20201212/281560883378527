    <p>Breast can­cer is a dis­ease that in­volves ab­nor­mal cell growth in the breast, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause health prob­lems.</p>
    <p>It is the most com­mon type of can­cer in women in­ter­na­tion­ally. In Sin­ga­pore, breast can­cer ac­counts for al­most 30 per cent of can­cers in women.</p>
    <p>Breast can­cers can have dif­fer­ent char­ac­ter­is­tics re­quir­ing dif­fer­ent treat­ments, de­pend­ing on the pres­ence or ab­sence of cer­tain re­cep­tors.</p>
    <p>The most com­mon form in­volves hor­mone re­cep­tors such as oe­stro­gen re­cep­tors and pro­ges­terone re­cep­tors.</p>
    <p>About 70 per cent of breast can­cers are pos­i­tive for one or both of th­ese re­cep­tors, mean­ing the pa­tient’s hor­mones play a role in the can­cer’s devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Hor­mone re­cep­tor-pos­i­tive breast can­cers tend to be less ag­gres­sive and grow more slowly. Th­ese pa­tients are likely to see bet­ter out­comes in the long term. Treat­ment will typ­i­cally in­volve hor­mone ther­apy drugs such as ta­mox­ifen, which blocks oe­stro­gen re­cep­tors in the breast tis­sue.</p>
    <p>HER2-pos­i­tive breast can­cers, or those that in­volve the hu­man epi­der­mal growth fac­tor re­cep­tor 2 (HER2) pro­tein, are less com­mon, af­fect­ing be­tween 15 per cent and 20 per cent of pa­tients.</p>
    <p>This type of breast can­cer arises when the HER2 pro­tein, which nor­mally reg­u­lates healthy breast tis­sue growth, is pro­duced in ex­cess. It tends to be more ag­gres­sive com­pared with hor­mone re­cep­tor-pos­i­tive can­cers.</p>
    <p>Drugs which block HER2 re­cep­tors may be pre­scribed to such pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Less com­mon are what is known as triple neg­a­tive breast can­cers, which do not have re­cep­tors for oe­stro­gen, pro­ges­terone or HER2.</p>
    <p>Th­ese can­cers, seen in about 15 per cent of pa­tients, are par­tic­u­larly ag­gres­sive and are as­so­ci­ated with higher rates of re­lapse and lower sur­vival rates. Treat­ments usu­ally in­volve surgery, ra­di­a­tion ther­apy and chemo­ther­apy.</p>
    <p>Misiden­ti­fied can­cers could re­sult in un­nec­es­sary or in­suf­fi­cient treat­ment.</p>
    <p>A false pos­i­tive could cause a pa­tient to re­ceive treat­ment she did not need, while ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the side ef­fects of the drug or pro­ce­dure she was given.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a false neg­a­tive could mean that she missed out on treat­ment she would have oth­er­wise ben­e­fited from.</p>
