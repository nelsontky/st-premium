    <p>MADRID • Madrid’s re­gional gov­ern­ment chief Is­abel Diaz Ayuso has re­quested the army’s help to fight the Covid-19 surge in and around the Span­ish cap­i­tal, where the au­thor­i­ties have or­dered a par­tial lock­down of some of the poorer ar­eas, prompt­ing protests dur­ing the week­end.</p>
    <p>At the height of the first wave of the epi­demic in March and April, Spain de­ployed thou­sands of troops to bat­tle the out­break.</p>
    <p>A re­cent spike in in­fec­tions, peak­ing at over 10,000 a day, took cu­mu­la­tive cases above 670,000, the high­est in Western Europe.</p>
    <p>“We need help from the army for dis­in­fec­tion ... and to strengthen lo­cal po­lice and law en­force­ment,” Ms Ayuso told a news brief­ing on Mon­day, af­ter meet­ing Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez in a bid to re­duce con­ta­gion rates in Spain’s worst-hit re­gion.</p>
    <p>She also re­quested that makeshift hos­pi­tals be set up again, about three months af­ter they were de­com­mis­sioned when Spain emerged from its strict lock­down, hav­ing re­duced con­ta­gion rates.</p>
    <p>Mr Sanchez said the cen­tral and re­gional gov­ern­ments would de­ter­mine the size of the mil­i­tary and po­lice re­in­force­ments at a meet­ing later.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, res­i­dents in the south­ern district of Val­le­cas, one of the ar­eas where the par­tial lock­down started on Mon­day, were up­set but re­signed to the curbs, as po­lice stopped cars getting in and out of the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Ms Ayuso’s gov­ern­ment had or­dered mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions in ar­eas that are home to about 850,000 peo­ple, spark­ing com­plaints of dis­crim­i­na­tion and protests.</p>
    <p>The Madrid au­thor­i­ties said they had cho­sen those ar­eas be­cause con­ta­gion lev­els there ex­ceeded 1,000 cases per 100,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But some res­i­dents com­plained that the mea­sures, which al­low peo­ple to go to work or school, failed to ad­dress the prob­lem of an over­crowded trans­port sys­tem. “They should reg­u­late the metro, (where) we are packed like sar­dines,” said a house­wife from Val­le­cas.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal busi­nesses felt the pinch. “We had no busi­ness this morn­ing; it is empty,” said Mr John Michael Mon­tana Sanchez, who man­ages three restau­rants on the same street in Val­le­cas.</p>
