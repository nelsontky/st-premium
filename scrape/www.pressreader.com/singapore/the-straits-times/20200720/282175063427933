    <p>An in­ter­na­tional school is of­fer­ing par­ents the op­tion of a full home­based learn­ing pro­gramme, at a price that is less than a third of its cur­rent fees.</p>
    <p>In­vic­tus In­ter­na­tional School, which opened here in 2016, is start­ing a vir­tual ex­ten­sion of its classes from next month.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, known as In­vic­tus Fam­ily, will cost US$4,000 (S$5,560) per year, a frac­tion of the $17,000 to $18,800 that stu­dents pay for lessons on cam­pus.</p>
    <p>The school is headed by Dr Ni­cholas Dug­gan, who is also prin­ci­pal of In­vic­tus’ third cam­pus in Sin­ga­pore in Far­rer Park.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual pro­gramme will cater to pupils aged six to 11, and it hopes to of­fer sec­ondary school ed­u­ca­tion that will be based on the Cam­bridge IGCSE cur­ricu­lum, fol­lowed by the A lev­els.</p>
    <p>Mr Alex Cheng, In­vic­tus’ mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor, said the Covid-19 pan­demic had sped up plans for this model of learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“We had thought about this viru­tal learn­ing cam­pus for a while, as there seems to be a de­mand for rigour in terms of learn­ing for home-school­ing par­ents,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They want to home-school their chil­dren but may not have a syl­labus or timetable that’s pegged to main­stream schools.”</p>
    <p>Not many in­ter­na­tional schools of­fer vir­tual learn­ing on a per­ma­nent ba­sis at this price range, said Mr Cheng. But it is see­ing more fully on­line pro­grammes like those by the Har­row School in Bri­tain and Kent Col­lege (Hong Kong).</p>
    <p>For a start, In­vic­tus Fam­ily is tar­get­ing par­ents in Asian coun­tries, who might not have ac­cess to in­ter­na­tional school­ing where they live.</p>
    <p>It started a trial in May with more than 20 pupils, whose ages ranged from six to 10 and who came from coun­tries in­clud­ing China, In­done­sia and Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>Classes will run on­line daily for five days. Stu­dents will fol­low a timetable that in­cludes aca­demic sub­jects and phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheng said there has been some in­ter­est from ex­pa­tri­ate fam­i­lies in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Price-tag wise, there’s a huge gap, so that’s a very big in­cen­tive for par­ents to see what’s the dif­fer­ence be­tween vir­tual school and phys­i­cal school. We don’t see both schools fight­ing for the same pool of stu­dents,” he said.</p>
