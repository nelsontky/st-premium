    <p>HONG KONG • A coro­n­avirus vac­cine trade could emerge in Asia’s cap­i­tal mar­kets next year, with deal­mak­ers con­fi­dent that the record-break­ing pace of raisings in the past year should be main­tained in the new year.</p>
    <p>Eq­uity cap­i­tal mar­kets (ECM) deals in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, in­clud­ing Ja­pan, to­talled US$439.1 bil­lion (S$586 bil­lion) this year, the high­est ever, ac­count­ing for 41 per cent of the world’s to­tal of US$1.06 tril­lion, ac­cord­ing to Refini­tiv data.</p>
    <p>The con­tri­bu­tion by the Asian re­gion to the global to­tal value of cap­i­tal raisings was the most since 2010, and ad­vis­ers at­trib­uted this to some coun­tries – led by China – emerg­ing from the pan­demic faster than the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>In Asia, health­care deals recorded the strong­est growth in the past year, up 148.6 per cent in terms of money raised, and bank ex­ec­u­tives be­lieve the global roll­out of the coro­n­avirus vac­cine will see the sec­tor dom­i­nate the lo­cal cap­i­tal mar­kets again next year.</p>
    <p>“There is a win­dow of op­por­tu­nity for Covid-re­lated trades to raise money in 2021,” said Ms Selina Che­ung, head of greater China ECM at UBS. “We ex­pect to see more health-re­lated and vac­cine com­pa­nies com­ing to the mar­ket in the first half.”</p>
    <p>The pace of cap­i­tal mar­ket ac­tiv­ity through­out the year sur­prised deal­mak­ers, who had ex­pected re­duced ac­tiv­ity un­til un­prece­dented liq­uid­ity from gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks be­gan flood­ing the global sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Al­most US$7.5 tril­lion has been spent by global cen­tral banks this year to cush­ion the eco­nomic im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund’s an­nual re­port pub­lished last month.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple did not ex­pect this level of ac­tiv­ity in the mar­ket, but it’s been very wel­come and it’s been a good boost to the econ­omy as it has in­jected a lot of cap­i­tal that has been needed,” said Mr Ken­neth Ho, manag­ing di­rec­tor of ECM at Haitong In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket is driven by liq­uid­ity and it should re­main in place for a while to come.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong will fin­ish this year as the world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lar ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) venue – be­hind the Nas­daq – with 119 deals worth US$31.21 bil­lion, the Refini­tiv data showed.</p>
    <p>In re­gard to Hong Kong’s IPO prospects, Credit Suisse’s head of ECM for the Asia-Pa­cific Johnson Chui said: “We see a size­able pool of com­pa­nies that have reached a cer­tain scale in their busi­ness where they are ready to be­come pub­lic, and we ex­pect in­vestors in 2021 will con­tinue to be open to look­ing at such com­pa­nies across dif­fer­ent sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>The US$37 bil­lion Ant Group IPO, shelved last month when China an­nounced a new reg­u­la­tory regime for fin­tech com­pa­nies, would have pro­pelled Hong Kong to the top of the global rank­ings.</p>
    <p>Mega deals such as those of Kuaishou Tech­nol­ogy, which could raise up to US$5 bil­lion, and JD Lo­gis­tics, which is aim­ing to raise up to US$2 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to Reuters re­ports, will be closely watched for the first half of the new year.</p>
    <p>Bankers are also on the look­out for Didi Chux­ing, which is con­sid­er­ing a Hong Kong IPO next year that would value it at up to US$60 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to sources.</p>
