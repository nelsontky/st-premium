    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, clean­ing com­pany An­ergy Build­ing Ser­vices man­aged to keep el­derly clean­ers at home while en­sur­ing their salaries would con­tinue to be paid.</p>
    <p>It also worked with the build­ing man­ager to re­duce its man­power de­ploy­ment since most ten­ants of the of­fice build­ing were work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad yesterday cited the case to il­lus­trate the need for bal­ance in look­ing after out­sourced work­ers, who keep Sin­ga­pore safe and clean, while en­sur­ing busi­nesses re­main sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>In the past few months, the Min­istry of Man­power, Na­tional Trades Union Congress, Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion and other agen­cies is­sued ad­vi­sories to com­pa­nies, set­ting out rec­om­men­da­tions for ap­pro­pri­ate Covid-19 safety mea­sures and pay­ment of fees for out­sourced work­ers. The or­gan­i­sa­tions also called for a con­sul­ta­tive ap­proach and change in busi­ness poli­cies so that prac­tices can be sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>Four ad­vi­sories were is­sued to the clean­ing, se­cu­rity, waste man­age­ment, and lift and es­ca­la­tor sec­tors re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, the fi­nal two ad­vi­sories were is­sued for the land­scape sec­tor, and the strata man­age­ment and fa­cil­ity man­age­ment sec­tors.</p>
    <p>The ad­vi­sories called on com­pa­nies to pay work­ers ap­pro­pri­ately and for ser­vice buy­ers to ex­er­cise re­straint in ac­ti­vat­ing penalty clauses. Safe man­age­ment mea­sures should also be put in place amid Covid-19. For in­stance, clean­ing and dis­in­fect­ing agents should be pro­vided for work­ers in the land­scape sec­tor who work out­doors.</p>
    <p>These work­ers should also have ac­cess to proper and rea­son­able rest ar­eas in or near their work premises.</p>
    <p>The tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory for the land­scape sec­tor added that ser­vice buy­ers should pri­ori­tise works that are es­sen­tial to main­tain pub­lic safety and health, such as tree in­spec­tions and prun­ing, now that there is a need to catch up on main­te­nance works.</p>
    <p>Where work­ers have worked more than their nor­mal scope of du­ties, ad­di­tional pay­ment should be con­sid­ered, the ad­vi­sories rec­om­mended.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy, who is also Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Defence, said most ser­vice buy­ers and providers have been fol­low­ing the prac­ti­cal rec­om­men­da­tions which “pro­tect the in­ter­ests and liveli­hoods of our out­sourced work­ers”.</p>
