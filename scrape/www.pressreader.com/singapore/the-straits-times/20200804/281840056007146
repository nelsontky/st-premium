    <p>China last Fri­day com­mis­sioned its an­swer to the US’ global po­si­tion­ing sys­tem (GPS) , in a move it has her­alded as a ma­jor mile­stone in its quest to be­come a space power.</p>
    <p>But be­yond that, China’s BeiDou nav­i­ga­tion sys­tem has sub­stan­tial strate­gic and eco­nomic im­pli­ca­tions, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>For starters, BeiDou, which joins three other global nav­i­ga­tion satel­lite sys­tems – the GPS, Rus­sia’s Glonass and Europe’s Galileo – shows China has con­sol­i­dated its ca­pa­bil­i­ties in this key tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>It also boosts China’s pre­ci­sion mil­i­tary strike ca­pa­bil­i­ties and its global clout by of­fer­ing coun­tries and com­pa­nies an al­ter­na­tive to the US-con­trolled GPS, they say.</p>
    <p>The state-run China Daily ran an ed­i­to­rial last Fri­day say­ing China had de­vel­oped its own indige­nous sys­tem to “avoid be­ing held to ransom by for­eign coun­tries”.</p>
    <p>“The BeiDou sys­tem, par­tic­u­larly against the back­drop of ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ism and McCarthy­ist poli­cies of the US, should serve to not only re­fute the base­less charge of China steal­ing US tech­nol­ogy but also spur the coun­try’s sci­en­tists to spare no ef­forts to make China self-re­liant in key tech­nolo­gies,” it said, ref­er­enc­ing McCarthy­ism, a 1950s-era US cam­paign to root out com­mu­nists.</p>
    <p>The im­pe­tus for BeiDou dates back to the 1990s, as China’s mil­i­tary sought to re­duce its re­liance on the GPS net­work.</p>
    <p>The first pair of BeiDou satel­lites were launched in 2000 and the last of its 30 third-gen­er­a­tion satel­lites launched into or­bit in June. Bei­jing claims the sys­tem is ac­cu­rate to 10cm in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, com­pared with GPS’ 30cm.</p>
    <p>Mr Alexan­der Neill, who runs a Sin­ga­pore-based strate­gic ad­vi­sory con­sul­tancy, said a fully op­er­a­tional BeiDou would be a “ma­jor boost” for China’s pre­ci­sion strike ca­pa­bil­i­ties, of­fer­ing pre­ci­sion guid­ance to its new gen­er­a­tion of bal­lis­tic mis­siles and hypersonic weapons.“The BeiDou sys­tem will of­fer pre­cise guid­ance to th­ese weapons which, be­cause of their speed, ob­vi­ously re­quire re­li­able and in­cred­i­bly fast com­mu­ni­ca­tions from this new gen­er­a­tion of satel­lites,” he said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has also been keen to high­light BeiDou’s com­mer­cial and civil­ian uses. At a press brief­ing yes­ter­day, Mr Ran Chengqi, di­rec­tor of the China Satel­lite Nav­i­ga­tion Of­fice, said BeiDou al­lowed the au­thor­i­ties to mon­i­tor land­slides caused by wide­spread floods in south­ern China this year with high pre­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem also has fea­tures its main ri­val GPS does not pos­sess, in­clud­ing a text mes­sag­ing ser­vice, use­ful in dis­as­ter re­lief op­er­a­tions, he said, adding that BeiDou-re­lated prod­ucts have been ex­ported to over 120 coun­tries and re­gions, with more than 100 mil­lion users.</p>
    <p>But Bei­jing could find it chal­leng­ing to en­cour­age wide­spread adop­tion of BeiDou – for in­stance, while the ma­jor­ity of smart­phones in China are com­pat­i­ble with it, ne­ti­zens of­ten com­plain Ap­ple’s iPhones are not.</p>
    <p>Still, Bei­jing has been us­ing BeiDou to boost its in­ter­na­tional clout, said S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies as­so­ciate re­search fel­low James Char, point­ing out it has been a part of Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive pacts China has signed with other na­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Neill said by of­fer­ing an al­ter­na­tive to GPS, Bei­jing wants to use BeiDou to set stan­dards for var­i­ous tech­nolo­gies that de­pend on satel­lite nav­i­ga­tion networks.</p>
    <p>“At a time when there is a big de­bate about de­cou­pling or dis­en­tan­gle­ment with the US, set­ting its own stan­dards, which are adopted in the mar­ket­place by other coun­tries, will avert some of the dam­age,” he said.</p>
