    <p>The lower cham­ber of the Philip­pine Congress was thrown into dis­ar­ray yes­ter­day af­ter key al­lies of Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte du­elled for its con­trol, stalling ap­proval of next year’s na­tional bud­get which in­cludes key fund­ing for ef­forts to re­cover from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The tur­moil fol­lowed what amounted to a takeover of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, with a ma­jor­ity of law­mak­ers al­lied with Mr Duterte’s daugh­ter and clos­est aide hold­ing a gath­er­ing where they voted to oust Speaker Alan Cayetano, who re­fused to step down.</p>
    <p>In a ses­sion held at a sports club, 186 con­gress­men elected Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Lord Al­lan Ve­lasco as the new House Speaker. But as they were vot­ing, Mr Cayetano was hold­ing his own news con­fer­ence, where he in­sisted the meet­ing, held away from Par­lia­ment’s build­ing, was a “cir­cus”. He said: “They’re hold­ing a fake ses­sion… I will not al­low (them) to burn this house down.”</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter tak­ing the oath as Speaker, Mr Ve­lasco asked Mr Cayetano to meet to dis­cuss a “peace­ful tran­si­tion for the ben­e­fit of our mem­bers and the coun­try”.</p>
    <p>For now, it is un­clear who the House Speaker ac­tu­ally is. A spe­cial three-day ses­sion to ap­prove the na­tional bud­get, sought ear­lier by Mr Duterte and set to start to­day, is ex­pected to set­tle that. With 186 out of some 300 con­gress­men and the Duterte fam­ily back­ing him, Mr Ve­lasco will likely emerge as the vic­tor.</p>
    <p>The feud came to a head af­ter Mr Cayetano re­fused to hon­our a gen­tle­man’s agree­ment, bro­kered by Mr Duterte, that he share the Speak­er­ship with Mr Ve­lasco. That deal al­lowed Mr Cayetano to take the helm of the House for 15 months till Oct 14, af­ter which Mr Ve­lasco would be in charge till na­tional elec­tions in 2022.</p>
    <p>Mr Cayetano has in­sisted that a ma­jor­ity of the House wants him to stay on, and ac­cused Mr Ve­lasco of be­ing “lazy” and barely making a mark as a con­gress­man.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte tried to con­vince Mr Cayetano to step down, but Mr Cayetano in­stead called for a nom­i­nal vote in the House to prove most of his col­leagues stood be­hind him.</p>
    <p>Mr Cayetano was Mr Duterte’s run­ning mate in the 2016 elec­tions but lost to cur­rent Vice-Pres­i­dent Leni Ro­bredo, who helms the op­po­si­tion. The Philip­pines elects its pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, Mr Duterte’s daugh­ter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Car­pio – who en­gi­neered the ouster of an­other House Speaker in 2018 – and Sen­a­tor Bong Go, known as a “proxy” for the Pres­i­dent, have stepped in. That so­lid­i­fied sup­port be­hind Mr Ve­lasco.</p>
    <p>Pun­dits say the dis­pute is ul­ti­mately about money. The House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives is de­lib­er­at­ing on next year’s pro­posed 4.5 tril­lion peso (S$126 bil­lion) na­tional bud­get. Mr Ve­lasco’s al­lies have crit­i­cised Mr Cayetano for ear­mark­ing sig­nif­i­cantly larger in­fra­struc­ture funds for him­self, his wife and “friends”.</p>
    <p>The na­tional bud­get is meant to “fo­cus on con­tain­ing the spread and mit­i­gat­ing the ef­fects of the coro­n­avirus while restart­ing the econ­omy to help the na­tion re­set, re­bound and re­cover”, ac­cord­ing to a gov­ern­ment state­ment. It sets aside 2.5 bil­lion pe­sos for the pur­chase of a Covid-19 vac­cine and some 26 bil­lion pe­sos for pro­tec­tive gear and as­sis­tance to poor pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry, with 754.4 bil­lion pe­sos, got the fifth-largest share in the over­all spend­ing plan, af­ter ed­u­ca­tion, pub­lic works, in­te­rior and lo­cal gov­ern­ment, and de­fence.</p>
