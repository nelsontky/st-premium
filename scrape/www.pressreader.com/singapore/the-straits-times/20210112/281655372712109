        <p>Co­op­er­a­tion be­tween na­tions will be es­pe­cially im­por­tant as the world ad­dresses Covid-19 and builds back from the pan­demic’s dis­rup­tions, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
        <p>Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter, called on coun­tries to work to­gether to make the best of the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion for a more re­silient, sus­tain­able fu­ture.</p>
        <p>“Each coun­try will also need to adapt how it works ex­ter­nally with oth­ers – in an open and more in­clu­sive way,” he said at The Straits Times Global Out­look Fo­rum.</p>
        <p>“At home, each coun­try will need to un­der­take struc­tural re­forms, to build new com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages to ben­e­fit from glob­al­i­sa­tion, and to en­sure that so­cial poli­cies are sus­tain­able.”</p>
        <p>In a speech, Mr Heng sketched out three broad ar­eas where in­ter­na­tional part­ner­ship is cru­cial: pub­lic health, cli­mate change and digital gov­er­nance.</p>
        <p>On pub­lic health, he held up the mul­ti­lat­eral Covax fa­cil­ity ini­tia­tive which is meant to en­sure eq­ui­table vac­cine ac­cess world­wide.</p>
        <p>He high­lighted the need to strengthen the col­lec­tive re­sponse to fu­ture pan­demics, and warned that Dis­ease X – a new, un­known dis­ease that is highly in­fec­tious, deadly and mu­tates eas­ily – is in­evitable. “We must lock in and strengthen the un­prece­dented level of in­for­ma­tion ex­change – in sci­ence, re­search and best prac­tices.”</p>
        <p>Pub­lic health co­op­er­a­tion goes be­yond pan­demic re­sponses, he added, say­ing global co­op­er­a­tion on health­care in­no­va­tion in ar­eas like deal­ing with an age­ing population will en­hance the re­silience and ef­fec­tive­ness of health­care sys­tems world­wide.</p>
        <p>On cli­mate change, an in­ter­na­tional ef­fort is needed, given how it is a prob­lem which af­fects all coun­tries, es­pe­cially small is­land states like Sin­ga­pore, said Mr Heng.</p>
        <p>He was glad the United States will be recom­mit­ting to the Paris Agree­ment, an in­ter­na­tional frame­work for tack­ling cli­mate change. The US for­mally left the pact last year un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who deemed its reg­u­la­tions harm­ful to the coun­try’s econ­omy. US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has said he would re­join the agree­ment on as­sum­ing the pres­i­dency next week.</p>
        <p>Dur­ing a ques­tion and an­swer seg­ment, Mr Heng said this, to­gether with the work of sci­en­tists and re­searchers, made him hope­ful that the global com­mu­nity will ad­dress cli­mate change more se­ri­ously af­ter Covid-19. The seg­ment was mod­er­ated by Straits Times edi­tor War­ren Fer­nan­dez, who is edi­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group.</p>
        <p>Mr Heng pointed out that in work­ing to­gether through sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy to ad­dress cli­mate change, coun­tries can achieve not only sus­tain­abil­ity goals, but also eco­nomic growth. “There is great po­ten­tial to im­prove re­source ef­fi­ciency for en­ergy, wa­ter and food pro­duc­tion, de­velop na­ture-based so­lu­tions for cli­mate change, and em­ploy bio­philic de­sign to build greener, more sus­tain­able and live­able cities,” he said.</p>
        <p>On digital gov­er­nance, Mr Heng noted the digital rev­o­lu­tion was well un­der way be­fore Covid-19, but that it sped up dur­ing the pan­demic as life shifted on­line, with peo­ple work­ing and learn­ing from home.</p>
        <p>But global norms and rules in cy­berspace are not fully worked out, he warned. As tech­nol­ogy be­comes per­va­sive in daily life, cy­ber se­cu­rity will be even more crit­i­cal and in­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tion is cru­cial to main­tain a se­cure cy­berspace.</p>
        <p>There will also be a need for com­mon stan­dards to en­able trusted data flows across bor­ders as digital trade grows, said Mr Heng. Sin­ga­pore has pur­sued digital econ­omy agree­ments with part­ners to de­velop new ap­proaches for the cross-bor­der digital econ­omy, such as e-pay­ment across ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
        <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from Mr Fer­nan­dez on con­cerns about cy­ber se­cu­rity and na­tional spy­ing, Mr Heng said such in­ci­dents are in­evitable given how tech­nol­ogy has be­come more per­va­sive. There is a need for greater global co­op­er­a­tion to de­velop frame­works to ad­dress such cy­ber risks, as well as greater in­di­vid­ual re­spon­si­bil­ity to be care­ful on­line, he added.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr Heng said the world is now at a cross­roads, and cau­tioned that if coun­tries do not come to­gether to tackle com­mon chal­lenges, it will be­come more frac­tious and un­equal.</p>
        <p>But he added that the pan­demic has also given coun­tries com­mon cause to work to­gether, and each one can take small con­crete steps to lay the foun­da­tion for a bet­ter post-pan­demic world.</p>
        <p>“If we suc­ceed, each coun­try can grow new strengths and com­ple­ment one an­other, achiev­ing more to­gether than we could on our own, and giv­ing us a stake in one an­other’s suc­cess,” he said.</p>
