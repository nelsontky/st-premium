    <p>Mr Toma Ta­jima, who will grad­u­ate next March, suf­fered re­jec­tion af­ter re­jec­tion in his hunt for his first job.</p>
    <p>He tells The Straits Times: “I was ex­tremely de­pressed, to the point that I was on the verge of giving up my job search al­to­gether this year.”</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old un­der­grad­u­ate at the Kanda Univer­sity of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies was look­ing for a job in global trade, lo­gis­tics or real es­tate sales, but kept hit­ting a dead end, with th­ese sec­tors badly hit by the Covid-19 down­turn.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing re­jected by 30 firms in a “gru­elling and end­less process”, Mr Ta­jima in­stead started look­ing at jobs in growth sec­tors such as in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy and man­u­fac­tur­ing. He has since ac­cepted a po­si­tion work­ing in sales at a man­u­fac­turer of ma­chine presses.</p>
    <p>While it was not quite what he had wanted to do, he says: “I was in­cred­i­bly happy, and will use the role to gain ex­pe­ri­ence and fig­ure out my de­sired ca­reer path.”</p>
    <p>A promised job of­fer did not ma­te­ri­alise for Ms Itoi, 23, who grad­u­ated from one of Ja­pan’s top art uni­ver­si­ties this year. She wanted to be known only by her last name.</p>
    <p>Though she was to start work in April at a fash­ion events com­pany, the of­fer was re­scinded. Her par­ents urged her to ap­ply for a con­tract po­si­tion un­til March next year – un­der a scheme by the Tokyo Met­ro­pol­i­tan Gov­ern­ment (TMG) to sup­port those whose employment has been hurt by the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ms Itoi now works in TMG’s Gen­eral Af­fairs Dis­as­ter Preven­tion Of­fice – a role she ad­mits is “a 180-de­gree turn from my dream job”.</p>
    <p>She re­mains on the hunt for more se­cure employment – hope­fully in her area of in­ter­est – but adds: “There is a sil­ver lin­ing in how I am now ex­posed to dif­fer­ent skill sets work­ing in the civil ser­vice, an area I oth­er­wise would never have touched.”</p>
    <p>There are many across Asia like Mr Ta­jima and Ms Itoi, with the Covid-19 cri­sis hurt­ing job prospects for a whole gen­er­a­tion of youth. Ja­pan’s over­all job­less rate stood at 3 per cent in Septem­ber, un­changed from Au­gust and the high­est since May 2017.</p>
    <p>But the data re­leased last month by the Labour Min­istry was driven up by job­less youth. Only two age groups had a job­less rate of above 3 per cent – those aged 25 to 34, at 4.8 per cent, and those aged 15 to 24, at 4.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>It is a sim­i­lar story in Hong Kong, where the job­less rate for those aged 20 to 29 is on the rise. In the sec­ond quar­ter, the fig­ure jumped to 9.9 per cent, from 5.2 per cent in the same quar­ter last year.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty has led pro­fes­sional Matthew Lai, 28, to tem­per</p>
    <p>his ex­pec­ta­tions for ca­reer pro­gres­sion and salary growth.</p>
    <p>He ad­mits to be­ing in a bet­ter po­si­tion than many oth­ers, not­ing that some friends have been think­ing about switch­ing jobs. “Dur­ing this pe­riod of time, a lot of peo­ple are cau­tious – they’d rather have some­thing in­stead of noth­ing.”</p>
    <p>A re­port by the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank showed that the un­em­ploy­ment rate among those aged 15 to 24 in In­dia could surge to 32.5 per cent this year, from 23.3 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Over in the Philip­pines, more than seven mil­lion peo­ple lost their jobs dur­ing the two-month lock­down that be­gan in March.</p>
    <p>Among them was Mr Roberto Diez, 28, who worked at an ad­ver­tis­ing agency. He tried his hand at on­line re­tail, sell­ing sweets a brother would source from sup­pli­ers out­side Manila. “But it was too much work, and the re­turns were too small be­cause we didn’t have scale.”</p>
    <p>The ad man has since found a new job at an­other com­pany, but says: “The pay is lower, and I’ll again have to start at the bot­tom. But it’s bet­ter than noth­ing.”</p>
    <p>In Malaysia, for­mer draughts­man Ad­nin Abidin, 31, says he is now will­ing to take up any job, so long as he can pay his bills and af­ford to buy milk pow­der for his new­born son.</p>
    <p>“I now work as a lorry driver. It doesn’t mat­ter what job it is, as long as it’s ha­lal, I’d do it... Beg­gars like me can’t be choosers, not when the pan­demic has left many job­less.”</p>

Many young peo&#xAD;ple have also had to take on jobs out&#xAD;side their ar&#xAD;eas of in&#xAD;ter&#xAD;est.</p>
