    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia saw its Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties sur­pass Mex­ico’s yes­ter­day – mak­ing it the coun­try with the third-high­est death toll glob­ally – as the Asian na­tion fast be­comes the new epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­dia is now be­hind only the United States and Brazil in both deaths and in­fec­tions as the coro­n­avirus sweeps across its vast ru­ral hin­ter­lands.</p>
    <p>The grim mile­stone comes a day af­ter the world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous na­tion re­ported the most daily in­fec­tions of any coun­try, 78,761, sur­pass­ing a pre­vi­ous high set by the US.</p>
    <p>In­dia re­ported 78,512 ad­di­tional cases and 971 fa­tal­i­ties yes­ter­day. It now has more than 3.6 mil­lion cases, while the death toll is above 64,000.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has been post­ing the high­est sin­gle-day caseload in the world since Aug 7.</p>
    <p>The Times of In­dia re­ported that the coun­try saw over 80,000 cases over a 24-hour pe­riod, but the Press In­for­ma­tion Bu­reau of the Min­istry of In­for­ma­tion and Broad­cast­ing re­jected the re­port and said that it was with­out any ba­sis.</p>
    <p>The huge num­bers have got the au­thor­i­ties wor­ried, es­pe­cially with peo­ple in ru­ral ar­eas largely aban­don­ing rules aimed at stop­ping the spread of the virus, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ku­mar San­jay Kr­ishna, the chief sec­re­tary of As­sam, one of the worst-hit states, at­trib­uted the in­creas­ing num­ber of cases to more test­ing, the open­ing of the econ­omy and com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are not fol­low­ing pre­cau­tion­ary steps and are vi­o­lat­ing the Covid pro­to­cols,” he said on Twit­ter. He added: “From Mon­day on­wards, there shall be vis­i­ble strict action taken against those who vi­o­late the norms of so­cial dis­tanc­ing or found not wear­ing a face mask.”</p>
    <p>But at the same time, fears are grow­ing for the world’s fifth­largest econ­omy, which an­nounced just yes­ter­day a record 23.9 per cent year-on-year con­trac­tion in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct for the June quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Hop­ing to avert more se­ri­ous eco­nomic dam­age, the govern­ment is re­lax­ing curbs and has an­nounced that ur­ban metro trains can re­sume ser­vices from next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Also, up to 100 peo­ple will be al­lowed to con­gre­gate for events, in­clud­ing reli­gious and po­lit­i­cal func­tions, from later this month.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s sec­ond-most in­dus­tri­alised state of Tamil Nadu said it would par­tially open pub­lic trans­port, al­low shop­ping malls and places of worship to op­er­ate, abol­ish full shut­downs on Sun­days and in­crease the num­ber of flights.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment is also al­low­ing states to let some school staff re­port for duty and has re­sisted pres­sure to de­lay ex­ams slated to start to­day, with more than two mil­lion stu­dents aim­ing for ad­mis­sion to med­i­cal and en­gi­neer­ing schools.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, In­te­rior Min­is­ter Amit Shah, who had been ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal twice af­ter con­tract­ing the virus, was dis­charged yes­ter­day. Many se­nior politi­cians have been in­fected.</p>
