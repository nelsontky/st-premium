    <p>De­spite the spate of Covid-19 ca­su­al­ties in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try, sev­eral F&B play­ers here are forg­ing ahead and open­ing new eater­ies.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, a few are bring­ing in for­eign food brands with an eye on con­sumers pin­ing for a taste of the for­eign, now that over­seas travel for leisure is off the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Joy Luck Tea­house at Ion Or­chard, which opens on Fri­day, will boast three Hong Kong brands – Tak Hing Fish­ball Com­pany, Hoover Cake Shop and Kam Kee Cafe – un­der one roof. The brands are brought to­gether by Sin­ga­pore-born tele­vi­sion pro­ducer Robert Chua, who is also be­hind the en­trance of Tim Ho Wan and Kam’s Roast here.</p>
    <p>He says: “Since peo­ple can’t go to Hong Kong, this could work in our favour as they are likely to come to (our out­let) in­stead.”</p>
    <p>For a taste of Thai­land, fa­mous Thai tea brand ChaTraMue marks its re-en­trance into the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket with a flag­ship out­let at Paya Le­bar Quar­ter open­ing on Satur­day. A sec­ond out­let is slated to open by the end of next month at</p>
    <p>One Raf­fles Place.</p>
    <p>ChaTraMue pre­vi­ously ran three fran­chised out­lets here, and the last one at The Star Vista mall closed at the start of this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim Xiu Ru, a lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness, notes that there is much hype over the for­eign F&B brands com­ing to Sin­ga­pore. “There will be a lot of ex­cite­ment ini­tially, based on one’s per­cep­tion of the brand when din­ing over­seas. Their suc­cess de­pends on the abil­ity to de­liver con­sis­tency.”</p>
    <p>There are pros and cons to open­ing new eater­ies now, she says, adding that op­er­a­tors have to deal with re­strained con­sumer spend­ing and re­duced dine-in ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>On the up­side, she says: “In preCovid-19 days, a lot of F&B con­cepts were launched on a very reg­u­lar ba­sis, which cre­ated clut­ter in the scene. The pace of new con­cepts be­ing in­tro­duced is a lot slower than in the past, so new brands can gain more promi­nence now.”</p>
    <p>The Bread­Talk Group is cer­tainly hop­ing that is the case. It is launch­ing two new home-grown brands – But­ter Bean cafe and tea shop Char­lie Tea.</p>
    <p>But­ter Bean opens a 45-seat cafe at Fu­nan mall on Fri­day, with a sec­ond, big­ger out­let at VivoCity due to open next month. The brand puts a modern spin on tra­di­tional Nanyang cof­fee with drinks such as Brulee Kopi Latte, topped with salty cream foam and torched su­gar. In­stead of the usual kaya toast, it will of­fer “toast pocket” sand­wiches such as B.F.F. (Bat­tered Fried Fish), which in­cludes omelette, sliced cheese and but­ter­head let­tuce.</p>
    <p>Char­lie Tea, to open next month at Takashimay­a Shop­ping Cen­tre, will spe­cialise in a va­ri­ety of tea bev­er­ages and baked goods. The drinks in­clude Yuzu Cloud drink, which is topped with a house­made “cloud” made from pink Hi­malayan sea salt and cream cheese foam.</p>
    <p>The three new out­lets for But­ter Bean and Char­lie Tea take over the spaces pre­vi­ously oc­cu­pied by Nayuki – a cheese tea and bak­ery cafe con­cept from Shen­zhen, China – which ex­ited the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket at the end of June.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, its Bread­Talk out­let at Whee­lock Place – which opens on Fri­day – is a “new-gen­er­a­tion” set-up fea­tur­ing a soya milk bar with flavours like yam, red bean and pumpkin.</p>
    <p>The group’s brand di­rec­tor Joanne Wong says the new brands tar­get the younger gen­er­a­tion, who have higher spend­ing power.</p>
    <p>“As a group, we are tak­ing a proac­tive ap­proach to the sit­u­a­tion now in­stead of wait­ing for preCovid-19 times to re­turn. As part of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy re­lies on tourism, and with t he i mpact caused by Covid-19, we needed to look at ways to fur­ther in­crease lo­cal con­sump­tion and en­tice our cus­tomers,” she says.</p>
    <p>Koung’s Wan­ton Mee, a hawker stall in Gey­lang with a 56-year history, is open­ing its first out­let in a mall, at Jem, on Tues­day after a three-month de­lay. It will of­fer the brand’s sig­na­ture won­ton mee topped with fried pork lard.</p>
    <p>Ku­moya cafe, known for its popup comic char­ac­ter themes, will open a sec­ond out­let in Or­chard Cen­tral. Themed “Ri­lakkuma – The Re­lax Cafe” as it fea­tures the Ri­lakkuma bear comic char­ac­ter by Ja­panese com­pany San-X, the 2,000 sq ft cafe is slated to run for one year. It opens on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Ku­moya’s first out­let in Jalan Klapa was closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and its di­rec­tor of op­er­a­tions Joseph Koh, 44, hopes there will be no re­peat of re­stric­tions on dine-in. “We are in the busi­ness of brand ex­pe­ri­ence, so dine-in and cafe vibes are very cru­cial for us.”</p>
    <p>Other new restau­rants open­ing from next month in­clude the Les Amis Group’s Le­mak Boys con­cept at Shaw Cen­tre. It spe­cialises in nasi le­mak and is run by the team be­hind the group’s Per­anakan restau­rant, Indigo Blue Kitchen.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, the group will open the sec­ond out­lets of ten­don restau­rant Ten­jin and patisserie Tarte by Ch­eryl Koh, both at Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Also open­ing in Oc­to­ber is Strait Place 1819 – by d’Good Cafe – at VivoCity. D’Good Cafe has out­lets in Hol­land Vil­lage and Jewel Changi Air­port. Its out­let in Takashimay­a Shop­ping Cen­tre closes next month when its lease ends.</p>
    <p>The 88-seat Strait Place 1819 of­fers a fu­sion menu, with a spin on lo­cal favourites. High­lights in­clude Strait Place Car­rot Cake, with both black and white ver­sions of fried radish cake topped with car­rot and cu­cum­ber; BCM Capellini, a luxe ver­sion of bak chor mee, which in­cludes scal­lops, caviar and prawns; and Cheng Tng Gen­maicha, with red dates, dried lon­gans, win­ter melon and peach gum.</p>
    <p>Whether these new eater­ies take off de­pends a lot on “whether cus­tomers like your food and are will­ing to pay for the type of food that restau­rants or cafes are of­fer­ing”, says Ms Regina Yeo, ad­junct se­nior lec­turer of mar­ket­ing at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School.</p>
    <p>But given the pan­demic, eater­ies will have to en­sure safe and hy­giene prac­tices among staff and din­ers. Says Ms Yeo: “In cur­rent un­cer­tain times, din­ers want to eat at places where they know the restau­rants and cafes carry out re­spon­si­ble checks.”</p>
