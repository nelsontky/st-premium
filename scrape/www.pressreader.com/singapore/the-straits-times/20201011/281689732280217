    <p>By the mid­dle of last month, home­sick­ness and de­pres­sion were eat­ing away at Malaysian Mohd Izwan Sarip.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old, who works in Sin­ga­pore, had been away from his wife and chil­dren since March, when Malaysia closed its bor­ders to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“When I was told to come to Sin­ga­pore, I had brought only two pairs of un­der­wear, two shirts and two pairs of trousers – I thought this was only for a few weeks,” said the ware­house as­sis­tant for on­line su­per­mar­ket RedMart.</p>
    <p>“My fam­ily means so much to me. I am so close to my four-year-old (daugh­ter) and when I left, my tod­dler had only just started to crawl, and now she’s al­ready 18 months,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Izwan’s brother-in-law, Mr Muhamad Faiz Rose­man, who works here for the Au­to­mo­bile As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s road­side as­sis­tance ser­vices team, hatched an idea to cheer him up.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, Mr Faiz asked their wives to take their chil­dren to a spot in Jo­hor that faces Wood­lands, while he and Mr Izwan went to a jetty at Wood­lands Water­front Park so that they could catch a glimpse of one another across the Jo­hor Strait.</p>
    <p>Mr Izwan waved and ea­gerly scanned the hori­zon for his wife and chil­dren while Mr Faiz, who has two sons aged two and four, se­cretly filmed the pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Izwan said: “I was look­ing for a per­son in a white shirt be­cause my wife said that was what she was wear­ing. Even­tu­ally, I found her.</p>
    <p>“I’ve not seen them since March, and it was nice to see them not through a screen, even if it was so far away.”</p>
    <p>In Malaysia, Ms Liana Idris, 33, and their two daugh­ters were thrilled to see him through binoc­u­lars. “My chil­dren were hop­ping while yelling ‘papa, papa’,” she said.</p>
    <p>The video of the re­union, edited by Mr Faiz’s wife Shafikah Sarip, who is Mr Izwan’s sis­ter, was widely shared when it was up­loaded on the Malaysia-Sin­ga­pore Bor­der Crossers Face­book ac­count on Oct 5.</p>
    <p>Mr Izwan said: “I heard that when my older daugh­ter saw the video, she started cry­ing. I don’t know when I can see them again, but ev­ery day I pray that I can see them soon.”</p>
    <p>Though Mr Faiz was able to re­turn to Jo­hor for 18 days last month un­der a Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment (PCA) be­tween both coun­tries, Mr Izwan has been un­able to take leave to do the same.</p>
    <p>Malaysian em­ploy­ees cur­rently in Sin­ga­pore, who wish to re­turn to Malaysia for home leave, can re-en­ter Sin­ga­pore un­der the PCA.</p>
    <p>Last month, it was re­ported that Malaysia’s Health Min­istry is look­ing at fully re­open­ing the Malaysi­aSin­ga­pore bor­der for daily com­muters in Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>For now, Mr Izwan and Mr Faiz have to set­tle for wav­ing at their loved ones from across the wa­ters.</p>
    <p>“I just bought binoc­u­lars for us,” Mr Faiz said.</p>
    <p>My fam­ily means so much to me. I am so close to my four-year-old (daugh­ter) and when I left, my tod­dler had only just started to crawl, and now she’s al­ready 18 months... I’ve not seen them since March, and it was nice to see them not through a screen, even if it was so far away.</p>
