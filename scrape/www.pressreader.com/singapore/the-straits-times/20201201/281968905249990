    <p>De­spite the many posters put up out­side and in pub­lic toi­lets for so many years, the same self­ish habits re­main among Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>I was at VivoCity last week, and vis­ited a women’s toi­let on the ground floor. The toi­let was gen­er­ally clean, but when I looked in­side three cu­bi­cles, all three had toi­let pa­per on the floor and un­flushed toi­let bowls.</p>
    <p>It was left to the tired-look­ing cleaner to pick up the toi­let pa­per and flush the toi­let bowls. That was in ad­di­tion to mop­ping the floor and clean­ing the sinks and taps.</p>
    <p>De­spite that, she still smiled at me. She ap­peared to be a for­eign worker. I won­dered what she thought of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Separately, I have also seen toi­lets un­flushed at sev­eral food cen­tres. Some toi­let seats even had foot­prints on them.</p>
    <p>Why have such bad habits not died out, de­spite our pop­u­la­tion be­ing ed­u­cated?</p>
    <p>Is it too much to ask for those pa­tro­n­is­ing the premises to throw lit­ter in the bins pro­vided and to check if their waste has been flushed prop­erly?</p>
    <p>Should proper use of toi­lets be made part of the syl­labus in school? And should those caught dirty­ing pub­lic toi­lets be made to clean toi­lets for a few days as pun­ish­ment?</p>
