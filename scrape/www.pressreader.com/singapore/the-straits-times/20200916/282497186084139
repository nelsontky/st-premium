    <p>Frank Lam­pard be­lieves Chelsea are al­ready show­ing the ben­e­fits of his £200 mil­lion (S$350.8 mil­lion) spend­ing spree as they kicked off their Pre­mier League campaign with a 3-1 win at Brighton on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Blues man­ager has splashed out on a host of new sign­ings and the early re­turns on his lav­ish in­vest­ment were promis­ing.</p>
    <p>Ger­many striker Timo Werner, a £53 mil­lion re­cruit from Leipzig, won the penalty that Jorginho con­verted to put Chelsea ahead.</p>
    <p>Kai Havertz, who made a £70 mil­lion switch from Bayer Lev­erkusen, was not quite so im­pact­ful, but Lam­pard will be con­fi­dent there are bet­ter days to come from the 21-yearold Ger­many for­ward.</p>
    <p>“Timo’s speed to win the penalty showed he is sharp and he was a threat all night. He is very mo­bile and I liked his per­for­mance,” Lam­pard said. “With Kai, we saw a lot as well. To get these min­utes will only be good and both of them will be huge play­ers for this club.”</p>
    <p>Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga was guilty of an­other mis­take when Le­an­dro Trossard equalised for Brighton with a 20-me­tre shot that slipped un­der the Chelsea goal­keeper’s weak at­tempted save.</p>
    <p>But Reece James’ su­perb strike put Chelsea back in front be­fore Kurt Zouma sealed the points.</p>
    <p>It was an en­cour­ag­ing result for Lam­pard, who has ac­cepted he is un­der pres­sure to de­liver a ti­tle chal­lenge after spend­ing more than any other club so far in the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>“I think to ex­pect ev­ery­thing to click on day one is very dif­fi­cult. But what they did do was show a bit of de­ter­mi­na­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally liked the work ethic and the dis­ci­pline of the team. We’ve been to­gether as a team for four days after the in­ter­na­tional break.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea fin­ished 33 points be­hind cham­pi­ons Liver­pool in fourth last sea­son be­fore a dis­ap­point­ing FA Cup fi­nal de­feat by Arsenal, but they are primed to im­prove if the new sign­ings can gel.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard’s other ex­pen­sive re­cruits, for­mer Ajax play­maker</p>
    <p>Hakim Ziyech and ex-Le­ices­ter left-back Ben Chilwell, were both side­lined by in­juries, while Thi­ago Silva was not avail­able due to a lack of match fit­ness fol­low­ing his free trans­fer from Paris Saint-Ger­main.</p>
    <p>The only frus­tra­tion for Lam­pard was Ar­riz­a­bal­aga’s howler.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard is un­der pres­sure after an er­ror-strewn sea­son, and with Chelsea hav­ing spo­ken to</p>
    <p>Rennes about Sene­gal goal­keeper Edouard Mendy, his days as first choice might be num­bered.</p>
    <p>In­sist­ing he has not writ­ten him off yet, Lam­pard said: “I’m happy with Kepa, I saw confidence in him, he’s here and I’m happy with him.”</p>
    <p>But for­mer Manch­ester United de­fender Gary Neville, work­ing as a pun­dit for Sky Sports, said he must get rid of the world’s most ex­pen</p>
    <p>sive goal­keeper at £71 mil­lion if Chelsea are to con­test for the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>“You won’t win the league with a keeper who is let­ting goals in from out­side his box, doesn’t dom­i­nate his area, con­cedes from set pieces, it’s not go­ing to hap­pen,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Sky Sports, Kepa’s er­ror was the 19th time he has con­ceded from out­side the penalty area since ar­riv­ing two years ago,</p>
    <p>more than any other stop­per.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard is also hope­ful that Werner can shake off a leg knock in time for Sun­day’s home league clash with cham­pi­ons Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“He took a knock when he won the penalty, which we hope is a dead leg,” he said. “I would like to think we have a bit of time to get him back (for the Reds game).”</p>
