    <p>BER­LIN • Coach Zine­dine Zi­dane in­sisted that Real Madrid de­served a point af­ter Casemiro scored a last­gasp equaliser, as the Span­ish giants fought back from two goals down to snatch a 2-2 draw at Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach on Tues­day to avoid a fourth straight Cham­pi­ons League de­feat.</p>
    <p>Mar­cus Thu­ram’s dou­ble put Glad­bach on course for a fa­mous vic­tory un­til Real roared back with late ef­forts from Karim Ben­zema and the Brazil­ian – three min­utes into added time – to sal­vage a point.</p>
    <p>While Real re­main at the bot­tom of Group B ow­ing to their shock 3-2 home de­feat by a de­pleted Shakhtar Donetsk side, they at least put a stop to their worst run in the Cham­pi­ons League since 1986.</p>
    <p>“For me, this draw is not a re­lief, it’s a de­served re­sult,” said Zi­dane. “We had an op­po­nent who had us in trou­ble on two or three oc­ca­sions, but we didn’t panic and came back with char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>“If we con­tinue to play like that, we’ll do great things and we’ll win matches – that’s for sure.”</p>
    <p>Shakhtar sit two points clear at the top of the ta­ble af­ter a goal-less home draw with In­ter Mi­lan in Tues­day’s ear­lier Group B en­counter.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing more than 60 per­cent pos­ses­sion, Real rarely trou­bled Glad­bach goal­keeper Yann Som­mer un­til the fran­tic fi­nal scenes.</p>
    <p>“Real Madrid are one of the best teams in the world and we should have known they’d throw every­thing at us,” said Thu­ram, the son of 1998 World Cup win­ner Lil­ian. “We have to learn from this ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>The French striker nearly en­sured what would have been a mem­o­rable maiden win over the La Liga cham­pi­ons, show­ing that de­spite their morale-boost­ing Cla­sico win over Barcelona last week­end, Real’s de­fence re­mains vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>They have now kept clean sheets in just two of their last 13 Cham­pi­ons League games and if not for Thibaut Cour­tois’ save, Alas­sane Plea could have put the game to bed af­ter be­ing put through on goal.</p>
    <p>The 13-time Euro­pean Cup win­ners were reel­ing un­til Zi­dane threw on Luka Mo­dric and Eden Haz­ard, who was mak­ing his first ap­pear­ance this sea­son ow­ing to in­jury, for the fi­nal 20 min­utes in an at­tempt to avoid another dam­ag­ing de­feat.</p>
    <p>They started to at­tack in droves, with Casemiro creat­ing their the first goal be­fore net­ting the equaliser as the hosts rued their in­abil­ity to hang on.</p>
    <p>“When you con­cede two l ate goals and drop the points, it’s not a good feel­ing,” ad­mit­ted Glad­bach coach Marco Rose.</p>
    <p>“It came down to the qual­ity of Real. We wanted to de­fend bet­ter un­til the end, but some­times, you need a lit­tle bit of luck and we didn’t have that.”</p>
