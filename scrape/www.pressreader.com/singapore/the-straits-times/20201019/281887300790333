    <p>China’s eye-open­ing trans­for­ma­tion start­ing from the late 1970s owes a great deal to one south­ern city: Shen­zhen. It was from here that pa­tri­arch Deng Xiaop­ing first made the case for re­form and open­ing up, af­ter study­ing Sin­ga­pore’s ex­am­ple in em­brac­ing the world and achiev­ing eco­nomic suc­cess. Shen­zhen was last week cast by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping as the hero on a larger can­vas still, em­body­ing the am­bi­tion for China to be­come the world’s tech­no­log­i­cal leader – and best­ing the United States, Ja­pan and Ger­many in the process. Speak­ing at the 40th an­niver­sary of Shen­zhen’s birth as a spe­cial eco­nomic zone (SEZ), he backed a strat­egy for the city to build “a tech­no­log­i­cal and in­dus­trial in­no­va­tion high-ground” while pledg­ing he would con­tinue to open up China.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal goal in the rein­ven­tion of Shen­zhen, which eclipsed Hong Kong’s econ­omy in size two years ago, is con­sol­i­da­tion. Since Mr Deng crafted China’s first SEZ in 1980, the two cities have grown off each other, with Shen­zhen draw­ing on Hong Kong’s stock of for­eign cap­i­tal, tech­nol­ogy and tal­ent. Bei­jing’s prob­lem has been in re­tain­ing the at­trac­tive­ness of the semi-au­ton­o­mous Hong Kong while en­tic­ing it to be closer to the main­land. Mr Xi’s pre­ferred so­lu­tion is the Greater Bay Area that merges 11 cities, in­clud­ing Hong Kong and Shen­zhen, into a sin­gle hub that could one day sur­pass the San Fran­cisco Bay Area, New York and Tokyo. Eco­nomics aside, the hub is to act as a mag­net for Hong Kong’s youth and spur them to iden­tify with the main­land.</p>
    <p>Over the last few years, China’s tech­no­log­i­cal as­cent, seeded mainly by US multi­na­tion­als, has be­come ap­par­ent. The rise of Huawei, Ten­cent, Byd Auto and other Shen­zhen na­tives has been both her­alded and viewed sus­pi­ciously in the US. Daily twists in the su­per­power tech ri­valry re­veal a wish to wall off the other. In the same week that Shen­zhen re­ceived an af­fir­ma­tion from Mr Xi, Ap­ple un­veiled its first 5G phone. But in the world’s largest 5G mar­ket, China, the so­cial me­dia boy­cotted the iPhone 12 launch. Huawei last month said it fears run­ning out of chips to make 5G phones af­ter the US shut off ac­cess to tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The grand plans for Shen­zhen and its sur­rounds will pro­vide the tech­no­log­i­cal thrust for China to even­tu­ally re-emerge as the world’s largest econ­omy, as it was in the 1800s. The dif­fer­ence, of course, is that it was closed off from the world then. While Mr Xi has com­mit­ted to open­ness to for­eign in­vestors in Shen­zhen, he has not ad­e­quately an­swered the ques­tion: How will a more pow­er­ful China en­gage with the world. Amid a sharp rise in anti-China sen­ti­ment in the midst of the Covid-19 cri­sis that be­gan in Wuhan, the next US pres­i­dent may tread the course set by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. Mr Xi’s ad­her­ence to Mr Deng’s proven path of keep­ing the door open could pro­vide a rea­son for a de­tour.</p>
