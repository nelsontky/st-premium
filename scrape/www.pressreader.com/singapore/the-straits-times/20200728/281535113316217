    <p>E-com­merce sites Shopee and Lazada have re­moved dozens of listings sell­ing unau­tho­rised Mi­crosoft soft­ware on their plat­forms for as low as $10. The listings, which were re­moved by yes­ter­day, of­fered so-called “lifetime sub­scrip­tions” where users sold prod­uct keys at a lower price than of­fi­cial re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce sites Shopee and Lazada have re­moved dozens of listings sell­ing unau­tho­rised Mi­crosoft soft­ware on their plat­forms for as low as $10.</p>
    <p>The listings, which were re­moved by yes­ter­day, of­fered so-called “lifetime sub­scrip­tions” where users sold prod­uct keys at a lower price than of­fi­cial re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times, which sent queries to the sites last week be­fore the listings were re­moved, un­der­stands that the prod­uct keys ped­dled by these on­line sell­ers were copies for the ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor and for other cor­po­rate sub­scrip­tions.</p>
    <p>On its of­fi­cial web­site, Mi­crosoft of­fers a per­sonal subscripti­on for its Mi­crosoft 365 pack of soft­ware for $108 a year. This in­cludes pop­u­lar pro­grams like Mi­crosoft Word, Pow­erPoint and Ex­cel.</p>
    <p>A Mi­crosoft spokesman told ST last Thurs­day that it nei­ther sells “lifetime” sub­scrip­tions nor does it sell prod­uct keys by them­selves.</p>
    <p>“Mi­crosoft does not au­tho­rise any plat­form to sell coun­ter­feit or in­fring­ing Mi­crosoft soft­ware. We work closely with the plat­forms to try to pro­tect cus­tomers from un­wit­tingly ac­quir­ing coun­ter­feit or un­li­censed soft­ware, and par­tic­i­pate in their mar­ket­place mon­i­tor­ing,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“We ad­vo­cate for the plat­forms to en­force their terms of use in tak­ing ac­tion against re­sellers who are en­gag­ing in the sale of coun­ter­feit Mi­crosoft soft­ware.”</p>
    <p>Checks by ST found that upon pay­ment, the sell­ers of the unau­tho­rised soft­ware would send a prod­uct key to the cus­tomer ei­ther via email or the chat func­tion of the ecom­merce plat­form.</p>
    <p>But there were also cases which were likely to be e-com­merce scams as some cus­tomers said they did not re­ceive their prod­uct keys de­spite their at­tempts to con­tact the sell­ers.</p>
    <p>Both Lazada and Shopee have pro­ce­dures to re­solve the fail­ure of re­tail­ers to de­liver on goods through re­funds. The two sites also in­sisted they have a ro­bust sys­tem to re­move coun­ter­feit prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>When ST shared with Shopee screen­shots of the listings be­fore they were re­moved, a spokesman said its list­ing team con­ducts reg­u­lar checks to deal with unau­tho­rised and coun­ter­feit prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“Coun­ter­feit prod­ucts breach our plat­form’s reg­u­la­tions and we en­cour­age all users look­ing to pur­chase branded prod­ucts to do so from Shopee’s of­fi­cial brand stores, such as the Mi­crosoft Au­tho­rised Of­fi­cial Store via Shopee Mall, and from other au­tho­rised sell­ers on our plat­form,” said the spokesman yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lazada has a “zero-tol­er­ance” pol­icy on coun­ter­feit and unau­tho­rised items and works closely with its part­ners to pro­tect the in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty of brands, said its spokesman last Friday.</p>
    <p>“Sell­ers who in­fringe our mar­ket­place reg­u­la­tions face es­ca­lat­ing penal­ties, in­clud­ing ac­count sus­pen­sion or ter­mi­na­tion. We have promptly re­moved the sus­pect listings and ter­mi­nated the er­rant sell­ers’ ac­counts,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft said that it will con­tinue to work with Lazada and other e-com­merce sites to ad­dress these rogue sell­ers and will carry out more in­ves­ti­ga­tions. It will also “take ac­tion where nec­es­sary”, with­out go­ing into de­tails.</p>
    <p>When asked how cus­tomers know that they are get­ting the real deal for a piece of Mi­crosoft soft­ware, its spokesman said that in­for­ma­tion is avail­able on its web­site.</p>
    <p>The tech gi­ant also said that it is up to users to be re­spon­si­ble for their own pur­chases.</p>
    <p>“It of­ten comes down to be­ing a savvy con­sumer: if the price is es­pe­cially good, ask your­self why that is,” said the spokesman.</p>
