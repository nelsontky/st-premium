    <p>The so-called Five Eyes in­tel­li­gence al­liance has lots of shared in­tel­li­gence and ex­per­tise. Ja­pan is in­ter­ested in join­ing it, but the bar­ri­ers to en­try are for­mi­da­ble, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal (be­low).</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Al­most re­gard­less of who emerges as Ja­pan’s new prime min­is­ter over the next two weeks, de­fence and se­cu­rity spe­cial­ists in the United States and a few other key West­ern coun­tries are brac­ing them­selves for the con­tin­ued drum­beat of what is by now a fa­mil­iar Tokyo re­frain: ap­peals that Ja­pan should be al­lowed to join the so-called Five Eyes in­tel­li­gence al­liance, which brings to­gether the spooks of Aus­tralia, Canada, New Zealand, Bri­tain and the United States.</p>
    <p>Of course, this is not Tokyo’s pri­or­ity. Still, as all those who have at­tended se­cu­rity meet­ings with Ja­panese min­is­ters or of­fi­cials over the past 12 months can at­test, there is a grow­ing crescendo of ap­peals from Tokyo for mem­ber­ship in the Five Eyes group­ing.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, many of these ap­peals were of a prob­ing na­ture: a ques­tion here, a hint there. But now, some of these de­mands are very pub­lic. De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono, for in­stance, never misses an op­por­tu­nity when he speaks at any West­ern gath­er­ing to raise this ques­tion.</p>
    <p>It is easy to un­der­stand the im­per­a­tive push­ing Ja­pan in this di­rec­tion. For the coun­try’s only hope of coun­ter­bal­anc­ing the grow­ing might and power pro­jec­tion of China lies in em­bed­ding it­self into West­ern-led se­cu­rity struc­tures.</p>
    <p>Nor can any­one be­grudge Ja­pan’s in­ter­est in the Five Eyes ar­range­ment as this is the in­tel­li­gence world’s most re­sound­ing suc­cess story, and ar­guably its most im­por­tant se­cu­rity in­sti­tu­tion, the glue to much of what re­ally goes for the West­ern world’s real se­cu­rity ar­chi­tec­ture.</p>
    <p>Still, most of the Ja­panese who ap­peal for their coun­try’s mem­ber­ship in this or­gan­i­sa­tion have lit­tle un­der­stand­ing of what this en­tails, or why pur­su­ing this ob­jec­tive will re­quire ma­jor sac­ri­fices from their coun­try.</p>
    <p>HOW THE EYES CAME ABOUT</p>
    <p>The nick­name Five Eyes – or FVEY as it is of­ten ab­bre­vi­ated by of­fi­cials – is de­rived from the stamp that used to mark in­tel­li­gence doc­u­ments whose cir­cu­la­tion was re­stricted to the five par­tic­i­pant coun­tries: the stamp read “AUS/CAN/NZ/UK/US EYES ONLY”.</p>
    <p>But un­like most post-war or­gan­i­sa­tions, the Five Eyes ar­range­ment grew not out of sum­mits or for­mal de­ci­sions, but or­gan­i­cally out of the in­tel­li­gence col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the Amer­i­cans and the Bri­tish dur­ing World War II, and par­tic­u­larly from the sig­nals in­tel­li­gence the two con­ducted dur­ing that war, which suc­ceeded in crack­ing the com­mu­ni­ca­tion ci­phers of Ger­many and Ja­pan, a de­ci­sive phase in de­feat­ing both en­e­mies.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal de­ci­sion to con­tinue the war-time ar­range­ment was made in a seven-page doc­u­ment signed by the Amer­i­cans and the Bri­tish in early 1946, less than a year af­ter the end of the war.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one was aware that the skills which the two al­lies honed – es­pe­cially in the field of in­ter­cep­tion of com­mu­ni­ca­tion and the break­ing of codes – would re­main vi­tal in the decades to come; the fact that the al­lies broke Ger­man and Ja­panese codes dur­ing</p>
    <p>World War II was only made pub­lic in the 1970s, al­most three decades af­ter that war ended, pre­cisely be­cause the Amer­i­cans and Bri­tish were keen not to ad­ver­tise their suc­cess in this field.</p>
    <p>It is also worth not­ing that the Five Eyes al­liance as it ex­ists to­day also ex­panded or­gan­i­cally and more by the force of events, rather than by de­sign: Canada, Aus­tralia and New Zealand rounded up the mem­ber­ship to­tal only by the mid-1950s, and at least partly only be­cause they be­came fully sov­er­eign na­tions in ev­ery re­spect and in ev­ery field, rather than re­ly­ing on their old colo­nial power of Bri­tain to rep­re­sent them.</p>
    <p>So, those who char­ac­terise Five Eyes as a sort of “whites-only, An­glo-Saxon ca­bal” are right, but only par­tially so; the or­gan­i­sa­tion grew out of prac­ti­cal, func­tional needs, and there was no one in ei­ther Lon­don or Washington who sat down and made a list of na­tions “wor­thy” to join such a struc­ture.</p>
    <p>SEE­ING EYE TO EYE</p>
    <p>Still, there is no ques­tion that, as time went by, the ex­clu­sive na­ture of the ar­range­ment be­gan to grate on many na­tions out­side it. For the co­op­er­a­tion within the group is ex­tra­or­di­nary, of a kind sel­dom en­coun­tered else­where in the world of in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>The five na­tions not only share “raw” in­tel­li­gence – namely the ma­te­rial which they glean from ei­ther hu­man in­for­ma­tion col­lec­tion ef­forts or elec­tronic in­ter­cepts – but also their anal­y­sis, the way they in­ter­pret this in­tel­li­gence and the se­cu­rity con­clu­sions they draw from them.</p>
    <p>Their in­tel­li­gence per­son­nel is in­ter­twined: it is quite com­mon to see US of­fi­cials work­ing in­side the “Dough­nut” – the cir­cu­lar build­ing out­side Lon­don which serves as the base of Bri­tain’s cryp­tog­ra­phy and in­tel­li­gence agency which goes by the in­nocu­ous-sound­ing name of Gov­ern­ment Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Head­quar­ters – as it is to see Bri­tish of­fi­cials rac­ing through the cor­ri­dors of the vast US Na­tional Se­cu­rity Agency’s build­ing in Fort Meade, Mary­land.</p>
    <p>The part­ners also ef­fec­tively di­vide the world be­tween them when it comes to the col­lec­tion of in­tel­li­gence, with each mem­ber of this al­liance “ma­jor­ing” on a part of the world.</p>
    <p>They also de­velop col­lec­tion and anal­y­sis tech­nolo­gies, a crit­i­cal field nowa­days, as much of the con­fronta­tion be­tween states move into the elec­tronic realm and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence of­fers new pos­si­bil­i­ties of analysing huge quan­ti­ties of data.</p>
    <p>Of course, the ca­pa­bil­i­ties which the US throws into this ef­fort dwarf those of all the oth­ers com­bined. Still, the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the five is a sym­bi­otic one: it would take years if not decades to prise them apart, even as­sum­ing any­one would want to do it.</p>
    <p>Con­trary to a pre­vail­ing myth, the Five Eyes ar­range­ment does not pre­clude ma­jor rows be­tween the part­ners. Noted Bri­tish his­to­rian James Barr doc­u­mented in two re­cent books the cloak-and-dag­ger games which the Amer­i­cans played against the Bri­tish in the Mid­dle East dur­ing the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
    <p>New Zealand also con­fronted the US in a bit­ter dis­pute which spilled over co­op­er­a­tion in­side the Five Eyes dur­ing the 1980s, when the New Zealan­ders de­clared them­selves a “nu­clear-free zone”.</p>
    <p>And, for a while, the ques­tion of al­low­ing equip­ment pro­duced by Huawei, the Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy gi­ant, to be in­stalled in na­tional com­mu­ni­ca­tion net­works had Bri­tain op­pos­ing the US stance.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is still the case that the ar­range­ment en­sures that the gov­ern­ments of its five mem­bers have the same in­for­ma­tion about global se­cu­rity de­vel­op­ments at the same time. They may dis­agree on what needs to be done, but they very sel­dom dis­agree about the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>And the Five Eyes ar­range­ment al­lows mid-rank­ing pow­ers such as Bri­tain or Aus­tralia to re­tain su­per­power sta­tus when it comes to in­tel­li­gence, a phenom­e­nal ad­van­tage which ex­ists in no other in­ter­na­tional arena.</p>
    <p>So, why shouldn’t the Ja­panese be al­lowed to join it? Af­ter all, they are one of the world’s big­gest eco­nomic pow­ers, big­ger than four out of the five mem­bers in the in­tel­li­gence club. And they share the same strate­gic objectives, in­clud­ing the same ap­pre­hen­sion about a ris­ing China.</p>
    <p>All very true, but all not enough to over­come the ob­jec­tions to their Five Eyes mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>JA­PAN’S DO­MES­TIC DIF­FI­CUL­TIES</p>
    <p>First, the tech­ni­cal ob­sta­cles. The re­la­tion­ship de­pends on trust, on the con­fi­dence that in­for­ma­tion shared will not leak. But the Ja­panese only en­acted a new of­fi­cial se­crets act in 2013, and that came af­ter decades of ur­gent plead­ing from Washington.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic se­cu­rity ar­range­ments are still in­com­plete and untested. And they still do not cover ad­e­quately com­mer­cial con­trac­tors work­ing with the state; “What the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment needs to do im­me­di­ately is to un­der­stand the sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion held by pri­vate com­pa­nies and pre­vent it from leak­ing,” says Pro­fes­sor Ken Otani, a Ja­panese aca­demic who stud­ied the topic closely.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, al­though Ja­pan’s elec­tronic eaves­drop­ping ca­pa­bil­i­ties are leg­endary, the coun­try still does not have an es­tab­lished for­eign in­tel­li­gence ser­vice, one staffed by pro­fes­sion­als who sys­tem­at­i­cally col­lect in­for­ma­tion, and do so in a se­cure and ef­fi­cient way. So, what they can bring to the club is much less than its ex­ist­ing mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sion-mak­ing struc­ture is also still de­fi­cient, with the Cabi­net Sec­re­tary hav­ing too much on his plate to co­or­di­nate the flow of in­tel­li­gence ma­te­rial prop­erly, and po­lice and other agen­cies fight­ing with each other for in­flu­ence over the prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, other gov­ern­ment min­is­ters have lit­tle un­der­stand­ing of in­tel­li­gence, Ja­panese par­lia­men­tar­i­ans have zero knowl­edge of such ques­tions, and the coun­try’s me­dia is only in­ter­ested in cov­er­ing pro­cure­ment scan­dals, rather than se­ri­ous strate­gic thought. For very un­der­stand­able his­toric rea­sons, Ja­pan sim­ply lacks the strate­gic po­lit­i­cal com­mu­nity and unity of pur­pose re­quired to act as a mem­ber of Five Eyes.</p>
    <p>And at a time when en­cryp­tion and eaves­drop­ping are the key chal­lenges fac­ing the in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity, Ja­pan’s do­mes­tic leg­is­la­tion sim­ply does not fit with Five Eyes re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>In short, Ja­pan will re­ally have to rein­vent many of its struc­tures if it wishes to be­come a mem­ber.</p>
    <p>OTHER IN­TER­ESTED PAR­TIES</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tant, how­ever, are the po­lit­i­cal ob­jec­tions. It is sim­ply not fea­si­ble to ad­mit Ja­pan into the Five Eyes with­out con­sid­er­ing South Korea’s mem­ber­ship; to do oth­er­wise would threaten the Tokyo-Seoul in­tel­li­gence co­op­er­a­tion link, which is just about the only one work­ing prop­erly be­tween the cap­i­tals of these two Asian states.</p>
    <p>It is also dif­fi­cult to con­ceive of a sit­u­a­tion by which Ja­pan is ad­mit­ted, but Ger­many or France – who have sim­i­larly ex­pressed their in­ter­est in the past – are not. So, a one-off en­large­ment is pre­cluded, but a big en­large­ment could well ren­der the cur­rent or­gan­i­sa­tion ir­rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>None of this pre­cludes co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the Five Eyes and other coun­tries; this is al­ready in­ten­sive and, in some cases, such as in com­bat­ing in­ter­na­tional ter­ror­ism, in­tel­li­gence anal­y­sis pro­duced by all five is shared with other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But the fact re­mains that the ex­ist­ing Five Eyes mem­bers still en­joy a unique com­mon per­spec­tive of the world of a kind few other coun­tries share and can co­op­er­ate in ways few oth­ers ei­ther can or want to.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the best way to look at this strange club is not as one which ex­cludes oth­ers, but as one which pioneers and spear­heads in­tel­li­gence anal­y­sis, to the con­tin­ued ben­e­fit of a much wider cir­cle of al­lies.</p>
