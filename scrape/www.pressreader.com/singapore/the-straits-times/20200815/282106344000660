    <p>It be­gins with a mild fever and malaise, fol­lowed by a painful cough and short­ness of breath. The in­fec­tion pros­pers in crowds, spread­ing to peo­ple in close reach. Con­tain­ing an out­break re­quires con­tact trac­ing, as well as iso­la­tion and treat­ment of the sick for weeks or months.</p>
    <p>This in­sid­i­ous disease has touched ev­ery part of the globe. It is tu­ber­cu­lo­sis (TB), the big­gest in­fec­tious-disease killer world­wide, claim­ing 1.5 mil­lion lives each year.</p>
    <p>Un­til this year, TB and its deadly al­lies, the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus (HIV) and malaria, were on the run. The toll from each disease over the pre­vi­ous decade was at its nadir in 2018, the last year for which data is avail­able.</p>
    <p>Yet now, as the coron­avirus pan­demic spreads around the world, con­sum­ing global health re­sources, these peren­ni­ally ne­glected ad­ver­saries are mak­ing a come­back.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 risks de­rail­ing all our ef­forts and tak­ing us back to where we were 20 years ago,” said Dr Pe­dro Alonso, di­rec­tor of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) global malaria pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It’s not just that the coron­avirus has di­verted sci­en­tific at­ten­tion from TB, HIV and malaria. The lock­downs, par­tic­u­larly across parts of Africa, Asia and Latin Amer­ica, have raised in­sur­mount­able bar­ri­ers for pa­tients who must travel to ob­tain di­ag­noses or drugs, ac­cord­ing to in­ter­views with more than two dozen pub­lic health of­fi­cials, doc­tors and pa­tients world­wide.</p>
    <p>Fear of the coron­avirus and the shut­ter­ing of clin­ics have kept away many pa­tients strug­gling with HIV, TB and malaria, while re­stric­tions on air and sea travel have se­verely lim­ited de­liv­ery of med­i­ca­tions to the hard­est-hit re­gions.</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent of global TB, HIV and malaria pro­grammes have re­ported dis­rup­tions in ser­vices, and one in four peo­ple liv­ing with HIV has re­ported prob­lems with gain­ing ac­cess to med­i­ca­tions, ac­cord­ing to United Na­tions agency UNAids. In­ter­rup­tions or de­lays in treat­ment may lead to drug re­sis­tance, al­ready a for­mi­da­ble prob­lem in many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, home to about 27 per cent of the world’s TB cases, di­ag­noses have fallen by nearly 75 per cent since the pan­demic be­gan. In Rus­sia, HIV clin­ics have been re­pur­posed for coron­avirus test­ing.</p>
    <p>Malaria sea­son has be­gun in West Africa, which has 90 per cent of malaria deaths in the world, but the nor­mal strate­gies for preven­tion – dis­tri­bu­tion of in­sec­ti­cide-treated bed nets and spray­ing with pes­ti­cides – have been cur­tailed be­cause of lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to one es­ti­mate, a three-month lock­down across dif­fer­ent parts of the world and a grad­ual re­turn to nor­mal over 10 months could re­sult in an ad­di­tional 6.3 mil­lion TB cases and 1.4 mil­lion deaths from it.</p>
    <p>A six-month dis­rup­tion of an­tiretro­vi­ral ther­apy may lead to more than 500,000 ad­di­tional deaths from ill­nesses re­lated to HIV, ac­cord­ing to the WHO. An­other model by the WHO pre­dicted that in the worst-case sce­nario, deaths from malaria could dou­ble to 770,000 per year.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral pub­lic health ex­perts have warned that if the cur­rent trends con­tinue, the coron­avirus is likely to set back years, per­haps decades, of painstak­ing progress against TB, HIV and malaria.</p>
    <p>The Global Fund, a pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ship to fight these dis­eases, es­ti­mates that mit­i­gat­ing this dam­age will re­quire at least US$28.5 bil­lion (S$39.1 bil­lion), a sum that is un­likely to ma­te­ri­alise.</p>
    <p>If his­tory is any guide, the coron­avirus’ im­pact on the poor will be felt long after the pan­demic is over. The so­cioe­co­nomic cri­sis in East­ern Europe in the early 1990s, for ex­am­ple, led to the high­est rates in the world of a kind of TB that was re­sis­tant to mul­ti­ple drugs, a du­bi­ous distinc­tion the re­gion still holds.</p>
    <p>The start­ing point in this ru­inous chain of events is a fail­ure to di­ag­nose: The longer a per­son is un­di­ag­nosed, and the later treat­ment be­gins, the more likely an in­fec­tious disease is to spread, sicken and kill.</p>
    <p>“The more you leave peo­ple un­di­ag­nosed and un­treated, the more (cases of in­fec­tions) you will have next year and the year after,” said Dr Lu­cica Di­tiu, who heads the Stop TB Part­ner­ship, an in­ter­na­tional con­sor­tium of 1,700 groups fight­ing the disease.</p>
    <p>The in­fra­struc­ture built to di­ag­nose HIV and TB has been a boon for many coun­tries grap­pling with the coron­avirus. GeneXpert, the tool used to de­tect ge­netic ma­te­rial from the TB bac­te­ria and from HIV, can also am­plify RNA from the coron­avirus for di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>But now most clin­ics are us­ing the ma­chines only to look for the coron­avirus. Pri­ori­tis­ing the coron­avirus over TB is “very stupid from a pub­lic health per­spec­tive”, Dr Di­tiu said. “You should ac­tu­ally be smart and do both.”</p>
    <p>In coun­try after coun­try, the pan­demic has re­sulted in sharp drops in di­ag­noses of TB: a 70 per cent de­cline in In­done­sia, 50 per cent in Mozam­bique and South Africa, and 20 per cent in China, ac­cord­ing to the WHO.</p>
    <p>In late May, as coron­avirus in­fec­tions climbed in Mex­ico, TB di­ag­noses recorded by the gov­ern­ment fell to 263 cases from 1,097 the same week last year.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is also shrink­ing the sup­ply of di­ag­nos­tic tests for these killers as com­pa­nies turn to mak­ing more ex­pen­sive tests to de­tect the coron­avirus. For ex­am­ple, Cepheid, the Cal­i­for­nia-based man­u­fac­turer of TB di­ag­nos­tic tests, has piv­oted to mak­ing tests for the coron­avirus. Com­pa­nies that make di­ag­nos­tic tests for malaria are do­ing the same, said Dr Catha­rina Boehme, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Foun­da­tion for In­no­va­tive New Di­ag­nos­tics.</p>
    <p>Coron­avirus tests are much more lu­cra­tive, at about US$10, com­pared with just 18 US cents for a rapid malaria test.</p>
    <p>These com­pa­nies “have tremen­dous de­mand for Covid-19 right now”, said Dr Mad­hukar Pai, di­rec­tor of the McGill In­ter­na­tional TB Cen­tre in Mon­treal. “I can’t imag­ine dis­eases of poverty get­ting any at­ten­tion in this space.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also hin­dered the avail­abil­ity of drugs for HIV, TB and malaria world­wide by in­ter­rupt­ing sup­ply chains, di­vert­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity and im­pos­ing phys­i­cal bar­ri­ers for pa­tients who must travel to dis­tant clin­ics to pick up the med­i­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>And these short­ages are forc­ing some pa­tients to ra­tion their med­i­ca­tions, en­dan­ger­ing their health. In In­done­sia, the of­fi­cial pol­icy is to pro­vide a month’s sup­ply of drugs at a time to HIV pa­tients, but anti-retro­vi­ral ther­apy has lately been hard to come by out­side the cap­i­tal, Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with HIV and TB who skip med­i­ca­tion are likely to get sicker in the short term. In the long term, there’s an even more wor­ri­some con­se­quence: a rise in drug-re­sis­tant forms of these dis­eases. Al­ready, drug-re­sis­tant TB is such a threat that pa­tients are closely mon­i­tored dur­ing treat­ment – a prac­tice that has mostly been sus­pended dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the WHO, at least 121 coun­tries have re­ported a drop in TB pa­tients visit­ing clin­ics since the pan­demic be­gan, threat­en­ing hard-fought gains.</p>
    <p>“This is re­ally dif­fi­cult to di­gest,” Dr Di­tiu said. “It took a lot of work to ar­rive where we are. We were not at the peak of the moun­tain, but we were away from the base. But then an avalanche came and pushed us back to the bot­tom.”</p>
    <p>The lock­downs in many places were im­posed so swiftly that drug stocks were rapidly de­pleted.</p>
    <p>Even if gov­ern­ments are pre­pared, with some help from big aid agen­cies, to buy drugs months in ad­vance, the global sup­ply may soon run out. “The dis­rup­tion of sup­ply chains is re­ally some­thing that wor­ries me – for HIV, for TB, for malaria,” said Dr Car­los del Rio, chair of the sci­en­tific ad­vi­sory board of the US Pres­i­dent’s Emer­gency Plan for Aids Re­lief.</p>
    <p>The hype over chloro­quine as a po­ten­tial treat­ment for the coron­avirus has led to hoard­ing of the drug in some coun­tries like Myan­mar, de­plet­ing its global stocks.</p>
    <p>“We’re very de­pen­dent on a few key de­vel­op­ers or man­u­fac­tur­ers for all of the drugs around the world, and that needs to be di­ver­si­fied,” said Dr Meg Do­herty, who di­rects HIV pro­grammes at the WHO. “If you had more lo­cally de­vel­oped drug de­pots or drug man­u­fac­tur­ers, it would be closer to the point of need.”</p>
    <p>Aid or­gan­i­sa­tions and gov­ern­ments are try­ing to mit­i­gate some of the dam­age by stretch­ing sup­plies and stock­pil­ing med­i­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>In June, the WHO changed its recommenda­tion for treat­ment of drug-re­sis­tant TB. In­stead of 20 months of in­jec­tions, pa­tients may now take pills for nine to 11 months. The change means pa­tients don’t have to travel to clin­ics, in­creas­ingly closed by lock­downs.</p>
    <p>In a few na­tions, like South Africa, most pa­tients al­ready pick up med­i­ca­tions from com­mu­nity cen­tres rather than from hos­pi­tals, said Dr Salim Ab­dool Karim, a global health ex­pert in South Africa and chair of a gov­ern­ment ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee on Covid-19. “That has been an im­por­tant ad­van­tage in a way.”</p>
