    <p>Hu­mans can sur­vive three min­utes with­out air, three days with­out wa­ter, three weeks with­out food and – ac­cord­ing to sur­vival lore – three months with­out com­pan­ion­ship. Whether true or not, what is clear is that peo­ple need peo­ple. And pan­demics, many of us are learn­ing, can be lonely times.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of lock­downs and shel­ter-in-place or­ders, some ex­perts worry about a rise in the num­ber of peo­ple feel­ing alone, es­pe­cially young peo­ple and older adults. But re­silience is also wide­spread, and study­ing lone­li­ness can re­veal a va­ri­ety of ways to com­bat it.</p>
    <p>“In the light of the pan­demic, there are ways we can in­crease that sense of con­nec­tion or re­duce feel­ings of lone­li­ness that we may be able to do safely at a dis­tance,” said Dr Ju­lianne Holt-Lun­stad, a pro­fes­sor of psy­chol­ogy and neu­ro­science at Brigham Young Univer­sity in Utah in the United States. “One of the things that re­search has shown is that so­cial sup­port is in­cred­i­bly help­ful in times of stress.”</p>
    <p>Lone­li­ness is a com­pli­cated emo­tion. You can feel lonely in a crowded room or feel con­tent in soli­tude. And peo­ple vary widely in how much hu­man con­nec­tion they need, Prof Holt-Lun­stad said. A use­ful way to think about lone­li­ness, she said, is as the dif­fer­ence between how much so­cial con­nec­tion peo­ple want and how much they are get­ting.</p>
    <p>It is a sub­jec­tive feel­ing, but re­searchers have be­gun to find sig­nals in the brain that put the need for so­cial in­ter­ac­tion on a par with the need to eat.</p>
    <p>In a study pub­lished last month, sci­en­tists de­prived par­tic­i­pants of con­tact with other peo­ple, then scanned their brains. Af­ter just 10 hours of iso­la­tion in a lab – where they could read or draw, but had no ac­cess to their phones or com­put­ers – peo­ple re­ported feel­ing lonely and crav­ing so­cial in­ter­ac­tion. When they then looked at pic­tures of peo­ple en­gaged in so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties, scans showed mid-brain ac­ti­va­tion identical to that of peo­ple who looked at pic­tures of food af­ter 10 hours of fast­ing.</p>
    <p>“It was sur­pris­ingly con­sis­tent across peo­ple,” said Dr Livia To­mova, a cog­ni­tive neu­ro­sci­en­tist at the Univer­sity of Cam­bridge in Bri­tain, and co-au­thor of the study. “So­cial in­ter­ac­tion is not just some­thing that’s kind of fun or com­fort­ing. It’s some­thing that we re­ally need to func­tion.”</p>
    <p>With­out that so­cial con­nec­tion, peo­ple of­ten be­come de­pressed, which fur­ther feeds feel­ings of lone­li­ness. Chronic lone­li­ness is also linked to higher rates of heart dis­ease, Alzheimer’s dis­ease, sui­cide and even death.</p>
    <p>If lone­li­ness is in­ter­fer­ing with your abil­ity to func­tion, seek pro­fes­sional help. For milder forms of lone­li­ness, decades of re­search sug­gest a num­ber of strate­gies to ease the toll of pan­demic lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The most ob­vi­ous is seek­ing sup­port from friends. Across a num­ber of stud­ies, peo­ple with strong so­cial re­la­tion­ships had a higher like­li­hood of liv­ing longer than peo­ple with weaker con­nec­tions. Just know­ing that peo­ple are there for them, Prof Holt-Lun­stad said, leads to a re­duc­tion in stress.</p>
    <p>In a time of so­cial dis­tanc­ing, this might mean call­ing, tex­ting to check in, drop­ping off a gift, or driv­ing by and wav­ing.</p>
    <p>“By pro­vid­ing sup­port to oth­ers, it can pro­vide a sense of mean­ing and pur­pose,” she added. “It can strengthen so­cial bonds and, in turn, lead to less lone­li­ness.”</p>
    <p>When seek­ing out con­nec­tions, fo­cus on your most un­con­di­tion­ally sup­port­ive friends and fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Some re­search shows that peo­ple feel more stressed and dis­con­nected when their friend­ship net­works in­clude peo­ple who have be­trayed them, were not there for them dur­ing tough times, fre­quently ar­gue with them or oth­er­wise cause neg­a­tive feel­ings.</p>
    <p>A call with a close friend, in other words, will prob­a­bly help more than a col­lege re­union over Zoom.</p>
    <p>“Sim­ply in­creas­ing so­cial con­tact is not suf­fi­cient,” said Dr Bert Uchino, a pro­fes­sor of psy­chol­ogy at the Univer­sity of Utah in Salt Lake City. “You need to in­crease con­tact in the re­la­tion­ships that are im­por­tant and very pos­i­tive to you. I think those are re­la­tion­ships that will get peo­ple through.”</p>
    <p>This might also be a good time to help your neigh­bours. Us­ing the neigh­bour­hood so­cial app Nextdoor to ran­domly as­sign peo­ple to per­form small acts of kind­ness – like de­liv­er­ing gro­ceries, chat­ting over a fence or par­tic­i­pat­ing in a neigh­bour­hood clean-up event –</p>
    <p>Prof Holt-Lun­stad and her col­leagues found that lone­li­ness rates dropped from 10 per cent of peo­ple to 5 per cent in peo­ple who did the kind acts.</p>
    <p>Re­search sug­gests you do not even need to know the peo­ple you are help­ing. Just do­nat­ing money to a good cause might help, Prof Uchino said.</p>
    <p>In a se­ries of ex­per­i­ments, re­searchers found that peo­ple who gave money to oth­ers were hap­pier than if they spent it on them­selves.</p>
    <p>But if you are over­whelmed by giv­ing, it can be­come detri­men­tal. In­stead, try hob­bies like cook­ing, gar­den­ing, writ­ing in a jour­nal or lis­ten­ing to mu­sic. Cre­ative arts can re­duce lone­li­ness too, and while singing in per­son in a choir might not be pos­si­ble right now, singing from bal­conies or through vir­tual groups can be pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>Lone­li­ness can strike at any age, but young peo­ple may bear the brunt of can­celled ac­tiv­i­ties and lost so­cial time. An es­ti­mated 73 per cent of Gen­er­a­tion Z adults re­ported feel­ing lonely in a sur­vey re­leased by the Amer­i­can Psy­cho­log­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Although group video calls and so­cial me­dia con­ver­sa­tions have taken over many peo­ple’s lives dur­ing the pan­demic, we still do not know how vir­tual com­mu­ni­ca­tion af­fects lone­li­ness. A 2012 study found that phone or in-per­son con­ver­sa­tions between moth­ers and daugh­ters led to hor­monal changes that re­duced stress, while text mes­sages did not. And heavy so­cial me­dia use has been linked with higher rates of lone­li­ness.</p>
    <p>For young peo­ple, who are al­ready used to dig­i­tal forms of com­mu­ni­ca­tion like tex­ting, it may turn out to be an ad­e­quate sub­sti­tute for in-per­son in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>And some types of so­cial me­dia use can help peo­ple feel more con­nected, said Dr To­mova, who is work­ing to fig­ure out what most sat­is­fies our hunger for so­cial in­ter­ac­tion and why.</p>
    <p>Sim­ply in­creas­ing so­cial con­tact is not suf­fi­cient. You need to in­crease con­tact in the re­la­tion­ships that are im­por­tant and very pos­i­tive to you. ’’</p>
