    <p>Re­tail­ers are not out of the woods yet with tak­ings at the till fall­ing again in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The de­cline came on the back of re­duced dis­cre­tionary spend­ing amid a tight labour mar­ket, and hit seg­ments like depart­ment stores es­pe­cially hard.</p>
    <p>Sales fell 10.8 per cent in Septem­ber com­pared with the same month last year, a steeper de­cline than the re­vised 5.4 per cent drop in Au­gust. Ex­clud­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles, sales shrank 12.7 per cent, the Depart­ment of Statis­tics noted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>To­tal re­tail sales were also down 4.5 per cent on a mon­thon-month sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, re­vers­ing the rise in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said: “Septem­ber’s re­tail sales data... un­der­line pos­si­ble con­sumer fa­tigue. This is also con­sid­er­ing that many clus­ters in the re­tail en­vi­ron­ment had seen pent-up de­mand in the pre­vi­ous three months at the start of phase two.”</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy, added: “The re­tail sec­tor is in­deed go­ing through a very crit­i­cal pe­riod of stress, fac­ing both com­pe­ti­tion from on­line of­fer­ings as well as the lack of tourist spend­ing. The struc­tural chal­lenges re­main from a high­cost en­vi­ron­ment, es­pe­cially from rental and man­power.”</p>
    <p>The larger de­cline in Septem­ber was mainly at­trib­uted to the com­puter and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment in­dus­try, where sales fell 22.9 per cent. The sec­tor recorded lower sales of mo­bile phones com­pared with the high base last year, when there were new hand­set launches.</p>
    <p>Other in­dus­tries also recorded dou­ble-digit drops. Food and al­co­hol sales tum­bled 41 per cent, while tak­ings at depart­ment stores shrank by 39.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng econ­o­mist Lee Ju Ye said: “The re­cov­ery path for phys­i­cal re­tail­ers will likely be a chal­leng­ing and long-drawn one as it may take three to four years for tourist ar­rivals to nor­malise, and (due to) the shift to­wards on­line sales that had gained mo­men­tum since the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Depart­ment store sales, which also rely on tourist spend­ing, will bear the largest brunt as con­sumers also turn cau­tious on dis­cre­tionary spend­ing. The pan­demic has been the fi­nal nail to the cof­fin for some depart­ment stores, like Robin­sons, and cloth­ing re­tail­ers, such as Esprit.”</p>
    <p>But su­per­mar­kets and hy­per­mar­kets con­tin­ued to pros­per, with sales in­creas­ing by 17.9 per cent. Fur­ni­ture and house­hold equip­ment sales also rose, up by 10.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>Tak­ings at food and bev­er­age ser­vices fell 29.9 per cent in Septem­ber, deep­en­ing the slump in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>This de­cline was led by food cater­ers, where tak­ings plunged 78.2 per cent as de­mand for event ca­ter­ing re­mained low. Restau­rant turnover dropped 33.1 per cent, while cafes, food­courts and other eat­ing places were down 17.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>The to­tal sales value of food and bev­er­age ser­vices in Septem­ber was es­ti­mated at $629 mil­lion, with on­line ac­count­ing for around 20.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>On­line cap­tured an es­ti­mated 11.2 per cent of Septem­ber’s $3.2 bil­lion to­tal re­tail sales value.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the re­tail sec­tor might re­cover grad­u­ally with travel bub­bles open­ing up and res­i­dents splash­ing out over the fes­tive pe­riod, although they warned that the soft labour mar­ket might hin­der spend­ing.</p>
