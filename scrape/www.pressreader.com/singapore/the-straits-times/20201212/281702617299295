    <p>A woman who al­legedly left her Wood­lands Drive res­i­dence while serv­ing a stay-home no­tice to buy bub­ble tea at Cause­way Point on March 23 later tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Nu­rul Afiqah Mo­hammed, 22, was sup­posed to serve her stay­home no­tice (SHN) from March 21 to April 4, but is said to have gone out on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions, ex­pos­ing her friends and oth­ers to the virus.</p>
    <p>She tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus af­ter she was ad­mit­ted to Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal on April 12.</p>
    <p>Nu­rul was one of two Sin­ga­pore­ans charged yes­ter­day morn­ing af­ter al­legedly breach­ing their SHN. The other ac­cused is Mohd Noor Salam Mohd Yu­sof, 40.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the Immigratio­n and</p>
    <p>Check­points Author­ity (ICA) ac­cused Nu­rul of trav­el­ling to Pung­gol Field to as­sist her friends with wed­ding prepa­ra­tions on April 2 and 3.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of her friend’s house­hold were present both times.</p>
    <p>She also al­legedly vis­ited other pub­lic places, such as a Unity phar­macy in Wood­lands Drive 44 on March 22, Nanyang Polytech­nic on March 23, a FairPrice su­per­mar­ket in Cham­pi­ons Way on March 29 and an In­dian food stall op­po­site her res­i­dence on April 2.</p>
    <p>Nu­rul is fac­ing a to­tal of seven charges un­der the In­fec­tious Dis­eases Act. The court heard that she in­tends to plead guilty. She will be back in court on Jan 22.</p>
    <p>About Noor, the ICA said he al­legedly vis­ited var­i­ous lo­ca­tions while serv­ing his stay-home no­tice be­tween March 26 and April 10.</p>
    <p>On March 31, he is said to have taken pub­lic trans­port to visit his mother’s res­i­dence in Choa Chu Kang and the Choa Chu Kang Neigh­bour­hood Po­lice Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>On April 2, he al­legedly left his mother’s home and vis­ited a Hous­ing Board branch in Choa Chu Kang, and Lim­bang Ko­pi­tiam. He is said to have been in the vicin­ity of Lim­bang Shop­ping Cen­tre in</p>
    <p>Choa Chu Kang as well.</p>
    <p>Noor was charged un­der the In­fec­tious Dis­eases (Covid-19 – Stay Or­ders) Reg­u­la­tions 2020. He in­tends to plead guilty and will re­turn to court on Jan 21.</p>
    <p>The ICA re­minded mem­bers of the pub­lic to com­ply with the stay-home no­tice re­quire­ments to safe­guard the com­mu­nity’s health and safety.</p>
    <p>“The case of Nu­rul, who had tested pos­i­tive for the virus, and had come into con­tact with her friends and mem­bers of the pub­lic dur­ing her stay-home no­tice, shows the very real risk breach­ing stay-home no­tice re­quire­ments can pose to all of us,” the author­ity added.</p>
    <p>Those who fail to com­ply, in­clud­ing peo­ple who tam­per with or re­move the elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing de­vice, or both, dur­ing the stay­home no­tice pe­riod will be li­able to pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Vi­o­la­tors can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for six months, or both.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers who do so may face fur­ther ad­min­is­tra­tive ac­tion by ICA or the Ministry of Man­power, and may have their per­mits and work passes cut short or re­voked.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic can re­port in­for­ma­tion about those who fail to com­ply with stay-home no­tice re­quire­ments to ICA at the web­site https://go.gov.sg/re­portshn­breach or call its hot­line on 6812-5555.</p>
