    <p>How se­cure are home sur­veil­lance cam­eras from hack­ers? Are homes let­ting in un­wanted pry­ing eyes, with so many peo­ple hav­ing vir­tual meet­ings and leav­ing their lap­top cam­eras turned on at home?</p>
    <p>These ques­tions have sur­faced af­ter sur­veil­lance cam­era footage from Sin­ga­pore homes showed up on porno­graphic sites, show­ing peo­ple in var­i­ous stages of un­dress or com­pro­mis­ing po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times’ Tech Ed­i­tor Irene Tham an­swers the top five con­cerns on we­b­cams.</p>
    <p>Q How se­cure are home sur­veil­lance cam­eras from hack­ers?</p>
    <p>A These so-called I nter­net of Things (IoT) or con­nected de­vices have con­trib­uted to the grow­ing IoT night­mare sim­ply be­cause the rules on how they are be­ing pro­tected in cy­berspace are lax.</p>
    <p>Searches on on­line e-com­merce plat­forms such as Shopee, Lazada and Qoo10 show that most of these cam­eras are un­known brands from</p>
    <p>Chi­nese man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>Most of the de­vices have these prob­lem­atic set­tings:</p>
    <p>• De­fault pass­word or no pass­word.</p>
    <p>• Images stored on a cloud plat­form on the In­ter­net that may not be prop­erly se­cured.</p>
    <p>• No op­tion for users to store their images on their own Google Drive or re­mov­able stor­age hard­ware.</p>
    <p>Home users who do not know any bet­ter buy these cam­eras be­cause they are cheap and easy to in­stall.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies are also known to have in­stalled these cam­eras as they are cheap, but there may be a price to pay when the data is leaked.</p>
    <p>Q What should peo­ple look out for when buy­ing sur­veil­lance cam­eras? A Users should be cau­tious when se­lect­ing what to buy. Get a cam­era from rep­utable sell­ers and se­lect one that lets the user set his own pass­word. Do not use the de­fault pass­word that comes with the prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Users can look for­ward to new cy­ber-se­cu­rity la­bels – sim­i­lar to en­ergy la­bels – that rate the se­cu­rity of IoT de­vices such as sur­veil­lance cam­eras to help them de­cide what to buy.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­tary scheme, pi­o­neered by the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore, has just been launched for Wi-Fi routers and smart home hubs.</p>
    <p>The la­belling scheme will soon cover more IoT de­vices, with more de­tails in the months to come.</p>
    <p>There are four lev­els in the scheme, each rep­re­sented by an as­ter­isk. One as­ter­isk means the prod­uct al­lows users to set their own pass­word and comes with se­cu­rity soft­ware up­dates.</p>
    <p>Two as­ter­isks means the prod­uct has ap­pro­pri­ate se­cu­rity tests con­ducted by the man­u­fac­turer.</p>
    <p>Three as­ter­isks and above means there are stricter re­quire­ments in­clud­ing cer­ti­fi­ca­tion by a third-party cy­ber-se­cu­rity lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>Q Are homes let­ting in un­wanted pry­ing eyes, with so many peo­ple hav­ing vir­tual meet­ings and leav­ing their lap­top cam­eras turned on at home?</p>
    <p>A Users should ex­er­cise cau­tion. The sim­ple so­lu­tion is to paste a sticker over the Web cam­era on the lap­top when the cam­era is not in use.</p>
    <p>Most lap­tops have oper­at­ing sys­tems with base­line se­cu­rity fea­tures al­ready en­abled, in­clud­ing user ac­cess and pass­word man­age­ment. Most work com­put­ers also have ad­di­tional se­cu­rity soft­ware, in­clud­ing vir­tual pri­vate net­works and anti-virus scan­ners.</p>
    <p>Thus, lap­tops are not easy to hack into un­less users click freely on links em­bed­ded in e-mails that take them to dodgy web­sites where mal­ware can be found.</p>
    <p>If mal­ware has al­ready in­fected a com­puter, cam­era images will not be the only data com­pro­mised. The user’s files and on­line trans­ac­tions, in­clud­ing bank­ing pass­words, will also be at risk of be­ing stolen.</p>
    <p>Q Are smart­phone or tablet cam­eras as vul­ner­a­ble to hack­ing as sur­veil­lance cam­eras?</p>
    <p>A Like lap­tops, the oper­at­ing sys­tems of most smart­phones and tablets come with base­line se­cu­rity fea­tures and pri­vacy set­tings.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese smart­phone and lap­top­mak­ers have de­vel­oped “hard­ened” or se­cured oper­at­ing sys­tems. But news re­ports have cited United States of­fi­cials and ex­perts claim­ing that Chi­nese de­vice mak­ers in­sert se­cret back­door pro­grams to al­low text mes­sages, e-mails and images to be sent to China.</p>
    <p>It is not known if the data is for ad­ver­tis­ing or for for­eign sur­veil­lance pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Q How should smart­phone and tablet users pro­tect them­selves?</p>
    <p>A If users are afraid of be­ing spied on, they should watch what they down­load.</p>
    <p>Many mo­bile apps seek ac­cess to swathes of sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion, such as the user’s on­line and so­cial me­dia iden­ti­ties and lo­ca­tion. Some apps also seek ac­cess to mi­cro­phone and cam­era func­tions.</p>
    <p>Smart­phone leaks, if they oc­cur, are most likely through dodgy or poorly se­cured mo­bile apps.</p>
    <p>Users should make it a point not to click freely on links em­bed­ded in e-mails, and in­stant and text mes­sages that take them to web­sites where mal­ware can be found.</p>
