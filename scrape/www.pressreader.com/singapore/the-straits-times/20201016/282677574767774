    <p>Me­di­a­corp host Quan Yifeng has de­nied talk that she and her ac­tress daugh­ter Eleanor Lee have fallen out with Quan’s long-time celebrity hair­styl­ist best friend Addy Lee.</p>
    <p>In pho­tos up­loaded to Eleanor Lee’s In­sta­gram ac­count of her 21st birthday party on Mon­day, she was seen cel­e­brat­ing the oc­ca­sion with her mother and lo­cal celebri­ties from host Das­mond Koh’s en­ter­tain­ment agency Noontalk. Koh, who was also present in the pho­tos, or­gan­ised the party for Lee.</p>
    <p>But her god­fa­ther Addy Lee was nowhere to be seen and was not men­tioned in a long cap­tion that ac­com­pa­nied the pho­tos. He also did not wish Eleanor Lee a happy birthday on any so­cial me­dia ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to lo­cal Chi­nese daily Shin Min Daily News, Quan and her daugh­ter have stopped fol­low­ing Addy Lee on In­sta­gram. This has raised eye­brows as the moth­er­daugh­ter pair are fa­mously tightknit with Addy Lee.</p>
    <p>Eleanor Lee, who is Quan’s daugh­ter with her ex-hus­band, ac­tor Peter Yu, even took her god­fa­ther’s sur­name at her 14th-birthday party.</p>
    <p>Addy Lee de­clined to com­ment when asked by the me­dia, but Quan told Lianhe Wan­bao that friends are for life and her re­la­tion­ship with Lee is still well main­tained.</p>
    <p>She said they have been in con­tact less as both sides are busy, but there was no spat be­tween them. She added that she had stopped fol­low­ing Addy Lee on In­sta­gram for some time and that the num­ber of peo­ple Lee fol­lows on his ac­count fluc­tu­ates in numbers.</p>
    <p>Wan­bao re­ported that ru­mours of a quar­rel be­tween Quan and Addy Lee might have arisen as her daugh­ter had posted on­line a photo she had taken with Lee’s com­peti­tor, celebrity hair­styl­ist David Gan, about two months ago.</p>
    <p>Quan said her daugh­ter had col­lab­o­rated with Gan for work and Quan did not think Addy Lee would mind.</p>
