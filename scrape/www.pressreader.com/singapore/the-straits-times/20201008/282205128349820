    <p>• Ja­pan’s min­istries have asked for a record 105.4071 tril­lion yen (S$1.35 tril­lion) in ini­tial bud­get for the next fis­cal year, the Fi­nance Min­istry said, as Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s new gov­ern­ment jug­gles the need to rein in the pan­demic and re­vive the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The gen­eral ac­count spend­ing re­quests for the fis­cal year that begins next April ex­ceeds the pre­vi­ous high of 105 tril­lion yen sought for the cur­rent year.</p>
    <p>The amount re­ceived a boost from de­mand re­lated to ur­gent steps to con­tain the virus spread and ease the pain from the eco­nomic fall­out, which has trig­gered</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s deep­est re­ces­sion on record.</p>
    <p>State Min­is­ter of Fi­nance Wataru Ito told re­porters yes­ter­day: “We re­main com­mit­ted to achiev­ing both eco­nomic re­vival and fis­cal re­form, and we’ll over­come the coro­n­avirus cri­sis to pass the fu­ture on to the next gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>The first bud­get un­der Mr Suga un­der­scored a strug­gle for the heav­ily in­debted gov­ern­ment to curb snow­balling debt that is more than twice the size of Ja­pan’s US$5 tril­lion (S$6.8 tril­lion) econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Many sub­mit­ted re­quests did not spec­ify the amount of spend­ing, leav­ing room to in­crease the over­all fig­ure as the Fi­nance Min­istry re­views the re­quests and fi­nalises the amount in late De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>High­light­ing the bulging costs of sup­port­ing an age­ing pop­u­la­tion and fi­nanc­ing debt, bud­get re­quests for so­cial se­cu­rity and debt ser­vic­ing came to 32.9 tril­lion yen and 25.5 tril­lion yen re­spec­tively, or more than half the over­all bud­get.</p>
    <p>Virus un­cer­tainty kept the Fi­nance Min­istry from set­ting a ceil­ing on over­all bud­get re­quests, mak­ing it dif­fi­cult to curb spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Two ex­tra stim­u­lus bud­gets com­piled for this fis­cal year to tackle Covid-19 will boost over­all gov­ern­ment spend­ing to about 160 tril­lion yen, or 1.6 times the ini­tial bud­get.</p>
    <p>This comes as com­pa­nies such as Ja­pan Air­lines (JAL) con­tinue to plan for new rev­enue streams, with its pres­i­dent Yuji Akasaka not­ing yes­ter­day at a me­dia brief­ing that business travel could shrink even fur­ther post-pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Akasaka said that is the rea­son why the air­line wants to cre­ate a low-cost car­rier net­work with three of its dis­count car­ri­ers – to tap leisure travel that, un­like business travel, could re­bound as the coro­n­avirus wanes.</p>
    <p>“Avi­a­tion won’t re­turn to what it was be­fore and business travel de­mand could even shrink fur­ther.</p>
    <p>One of our tar­gets is tourism.”</p>
    <p>JAL’s three low-cost re­gional car­ri­ers in­clude Jet­star, which it op­er­ates with Qan­tas Air­lines, Spring Air­lines Ja­pan, a joint ven­ture with China’s Spring Air­lines, and its wholly owned Zi­pair unit.</p>
    <p>Mr Akasaka did not say whether Ja­pan would seek to for­mally merge their oper­a­tions through acquisitio­ns.</p>
    <p>To sur­vive the down­turn in de­mand, which JAL ex­pects to last un­til at least 2024 on in­ter­na­tional routes, the car­rier would look to boost rev­enue from non-air­line busi­nesses such as drone par­cel de­liv­er­ies, said Mr Akasaka.</p>
