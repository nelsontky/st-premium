    <p>BEI­JING • Tens of thou­sands of peo­ple in an eth­nic Mon­go­lian re­gion of north­ern China have joined rare protests and school boy­cotts against a new cur­ricu­lum that they fear will wipe out their mi­nor­ity cul­ture, res­i­dents said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sud­den pol­icy change in In­ner Mon­go­lia means all eth­nic mi­nor­ity schools in the re­mote re­gion will now be re­quired to teach core sub­jects in Man­darin rather than Mon­go­lian, echo­ing sim­i­lar moves in Ti­bet and Xin­jiang to as­sim­i­late lo­cal mi­nori­ties into the dom­i­nant Han Chi­nese pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“Al­most every Mon­go­lian in In­ner Mon­go­lia is op­posed to the re­vised cur­ricu­lum,” a 32-year-old herder sur­named Hu from the Xilin­gol League area said, warn­ing that Mon­go­lian chil­dren were los­ing flu­ency in their mother tongue. “In a few decades, a mi­nor­ity lan­guage will be on the verge of ex­tinc­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ten­sions flared across the vast grass­land re­gion bor­der­ing Mon­go­lia and Rus­sia af­ter the pol­icy was an­nounced by the In­ner Mon­go­lia Ed­u­ca­tion Bureau last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Mass protests in­volv­ing par­ents, stu­dents and or­di­nary cit­i­zens have erupted across the re­gion, ac­cord­ing to video clips pro­vided by res­i­dents to Agence France-Presse, while thou­sands of stu­dents have boy­cotted classes.</p>
    <p>In some clips, scores of stu­dents can be heard shout­ing in Mon­go­lian: “I swear to death that I will al­ways learn my mother tongue.”</p>
    <p>“There are at least tens of thou­sands of peo­ple protest­ing across In­ner Mon­go­lia,” said Baatar, a 27-year-old herder in the Hing­gan League area who re­fused to give his full name, cit­ing se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>By yes­ter­day, sev­eral bilin­gual board­ing schools in Hing­gan League and nearby Tongliao city had been sur­rounded by hun­dreds of para­mil­i­tary po­lice to pre­vent chil­dren who were al­ready en­rolled from leav­ing, Baatar added. Lo­cals said par­ents also faced wide­spread pres­sure from po­lice to send their chil­dren to school, with stu­dents threat­ened with ex­pul­sion if they did not at­tend.</p>
