    <p>A woman who re­peat­edly abused her do­mes­tic helper from her first day of work was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to 21 months’ im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>The of­fender’s hus­band, who had later joined his wife in as­sault­ing In­dian national Aman­deep Kaur, then 27, was sen­tenced to four months in jail.</p>
    <p>On June 9, fol­low­ing a trial, Dis­trict Judge Shaif­fudin Saruwan found Farha Tehseen, 39, guilty of nine counts of as­sault and one count of crim­i­nal in­tim­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>He con­victed her hus­band, Mo­ham­mad Tasleem, 41, of two as­sault charges.</p>
    <p>Both of­fend­ers are In­dian na­tion­als and Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court also or­dered Farha to pay the helper $4,500 in com­pen­sa­tion, while her hus­band was to pay $1,000.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Hous­ton Jo­han­nus had said in his sub­mis­sions that Ms Kaur started work­ing for the cou­ple, who have two young sons, on Nov 9, 2016.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, Ms Kaur tes­ti­fied that Farha treated her “very badly” from the out­set.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tor said Farha slapped and punched the maid on the day she started work­ing for her.</p>
    <p>Ms Kaur tes­ti­fied that Farha slapped her while she was mak­ing flat­bread in the kitchen. She also said that Farha later punched her right eye.</p>
    <p>Ms Kaur tes­ti­fied that Tasleem as­saulted her for the first time in mid-De­cem­ber 2016, as he felt that she was slow in pre­par­ing milk for his younger son, who was then two years old. Tasleem punched her right eye once.</p>
    <p>He as­saulted her for the sec­ond time about nine days later, when he kicked her waist twice.</p>
    <p>On Dec 31, 2016, Farha kicked the maid’s lower back twice be­fore grab­bing her hair and pulling her out of a room. Ms Kaur was also punched once on her nose, and it bled.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter, the cou­ple and their chil­dren left the flat on the fourth storey of a Hous­ing Board block in River­vale Cres­cent, Sengkang, lock­ing the front door be­hind them.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tor said that “in a mo­ment of ut­ter ter­ror and des­per­a­tion”, Ms Kaur, who did not have the house keys, climbed out of a liv­ing room win­dow and perched her­self “dan­ger­ously” on a ledge.</p>
    <p>A for­eign worker, Mr Mani Manoha­ran, who was do­ing some paint­ing works in the es­tate, later spot­ted the maid and used a gon­dola to help her down.</p>
    <p>The court heard yes­ter­day that the cou­ple plan to ap­peal against their con­vic­tion and sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Farha was of­fered bail of $15,000, while Tasleem’s bail was set at $8,000.</p>
