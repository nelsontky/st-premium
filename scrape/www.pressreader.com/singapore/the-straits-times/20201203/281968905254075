    <p>Am­bas­sador Tommy Koh’s Opin­ion piece on Is­lam and Europe (Free­dom of speech: An ap­peal to Europe, Nov 28) calls for a few clar­i­fi­ca­tions. We do not wish to reignite a de­bate which, while worth hav­ing, has made many vic­tims in the past few weeks.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some spe­cific mis­giv­ings that have been cul­ti­vated by in­di­vid­u­als and groups which are not as well-in­ten­tioned as Pro­fes­sor Koh de­serve a re­ply.</p>
    <p>There are dozens of mil­lions of faith­ful and mil­lions of Mus­lims in Europe. Our laws guar­an­tee their free­dom to prac­tise their re­li­gion. Our na­tions have a long his­tory of bring­ing to­gether peo­ple from dif­fer­ent faiths. Al­though this his­tory has not al­ways been peace­ful, the ideas of en­light­en­ment and the con­struc­tion of our poli­ties have taught us to not only co­ex­ist but also live to­gether in peace and tol­er­ance. We are deeply mind­ful of the im­por­tance of re­li­gion for many of our fel­low cit­i­zens and pro­foundly re­spect their faith, how­ever large or small their con­gre­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>In this con­text, it is a mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion to say that our coun­tries have in­sulted Is­lam or its Prophet.</p>
    <p>We value free­dom of ex­pres­sion as a cornerston­e of our democ­ra­cies. This does not mean that the use be­ing made of this free­dom is a re­flec­tion of of­fi­cial poli­cies. Gov­ern­ments, too, are sub­jected to car­i­ca­tures and crit­i­cism. We ex­pect dif­fer­ences of opin­ion to arise and to spark de­bates. None of this can jus­tify the killing of car­toon­ists, teach­ers or any­one else. Tol­er­ance also im­plies that dif­fer­ences can be set­tled in a peace­ful man­ner, in­clud­ing by agree­ing to dis­agree.</p>
    <p>This be­ing said, there are some lim­its to free­dom of ex­pres­sion in our coun­tries, too. Our gov­ern­ments have taken steps to fight racism and hate speech, ei­ther through laws or pub­lic poli­cies.</p>
    <p>In­cite­ment to hos­til­ity and vi­o­lence is not ac­cept­able. This is true of at­tacks against Mus­lims as against any ci­ti­zen or group of cit­i­zens. Our his­tory has taught us the price of racism. While we shall not for­get that, pro­tect­ing peo­ple and com­mu­ni­ties does not equate to shield­ing their be­liefs. The com­par­i­son be­tween the Holo­caust (a his­tor­i­cal fact) and a re­li­gious creed is clearly not valid in this re­gard.</p>
    <p>We are com­mit­ted to free­dom of re­li­gion and be­lief as well as free­dom of ex­pres­sion. We are con­vinced that they can co­ex­ist and en­rich each other, just as be­liev­ers of dif­fer­ent faiths as well as non-be­liev­ers can. We also think that each of our coun­tries, with its his­tory and po­lit­i­cal sys­tem, is bal­anc­ing them in its own, demo­cratic way.</p>
