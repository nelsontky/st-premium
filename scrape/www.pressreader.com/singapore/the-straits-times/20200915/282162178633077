    <p>• Thai Air­ways In­ter­na­tional, the king­dom’s flag­ship car­rier, got court ap­proval for its debt re­struc­tur­ing plan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tral Bank­ruptcy Court de­cided that the air­line can pro­ceed with its plan to re­ha­bil­i­tate its debt. The com­pany, which had to­tal li­a­bil­i­ties of 332.2 bil­lion baht (S$14.5 bil­lion) at the end of June, faces one of its big­gest chal­lenges in its 60-year his­tory as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hits the coun­try’s tourism-de­pen­dent econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 crisis has dev­as­tated the global travel in­dus­try, forc­ing air­lines to sus­pend flights, lay off em­ploy­ees and seek fi­nan­cial help from gov­ern­ments and in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies such as Virgin Aus­tralia Hold­ings and Avianca Hold­ings, Latin Amer­ica’s sec­ond-largest air­line, have gone into ad­min­is­tra­tion or sought bank­ruptcy protection. In­dus­try strains have been mount­ing in Asia, with Sin­ga­pore Air­lines elim­i­nat­ing about 20 per cent of its work­force.</p>
    <p>Thai Air­ways cred­i­tors are likely faced with a pro­tracted process: the com­pany is es­ti­mat­ing that the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion could take as long as seven years.</p>
    <p>The court rul­ing may al­low Thai Air­ways to start talks soon with debt hold­ers on the re­struc­tur­ing terms.</p>
    <p>“The court’s debt re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion ap­proval is just a tiny step,” chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Chan­chai Chaipr­a­sit from Price­wa­ter­house­Cooper’s Thai unit said be­fore the rul­ing. “It’s an up­hill task to come up with a debt plan that would sat­isfy banks, air­craft lessors, sup­pli­ers and other lenders.”</p>
    <p>Thai Air­ways was dealt a fur­ther blow re­cently, when the na­tion’s Min­istry of Trans­port iden­ti­fied po­ten­tial cor­rup­tion in the un­der­pric­ing of tick­ets and ex­ces­sive over­time costs. Thai­land’s Min­istry of Fi­nance owns around 48 per cent of Thai Air­ways, ac­cord­ing to an Au­gust fil­ing.</p>
    <p>The air­line had de­faulted on loans and bonds to­talling 85 bil­lion baht, or 33.1 per cent of its to­tal as­sets, ac­cord­ing to its lat­est state­ment on July 22. It re­ported a net loss of 28 bil­lion baht in the first half of this year, a four­fold-plus jump from 6.44 bil­lion baht dur­ing the same time a year ago, as the car­rier can­celled sched­uled flights from April to com­ply with gov­ern­ment rules to con­tain the pan­demic.</p>
