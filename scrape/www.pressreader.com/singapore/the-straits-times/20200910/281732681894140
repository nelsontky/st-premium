    <p>To de­tect and con­tain new Covid-19 cases in dor­mi­to­ries, the Min­istry of Man­power has put in place a “multi-lay­ered strat­egy” with three main points.</p>
    <p>1 TO PRE­VENT PO­TEN­TIAL IN­FEC­TIONS</p>
    <p>“Safe Liv­ing, Safe Work­ing and Safe Rest Day” mea­sures have been im­ple­mented in the worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Be­fore dor­mi­tory res­i­dents are al­lowed to re­turn to work, dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors have to im­ple­ment var­i­ous phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to limit work­ers from mix­ing across rooms, lev­els and blocks, as well as when us­ing com­mon fa­cil­i­ties and dur­ing trans­port to and from work sites.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tors must also mon­i­tor their res­i­dents’ health and take the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions so that those who are un­well are quickly iso­lated and pro­vided with med­i­cal treat­ment.</p>
    <p>2 TO DE­TECT NEW CASES SWIFTLY</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power has de­ployed a num­ber of steps, in­clud­ing hav­ing work­ers self-mon­i­tor and up­date their health sta­tus reg­u­larly. Those who re­port sick with acute res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses are ob­served closely.</p>
    <p>Waste­water at se­lected dor­mi­to­ries is also tested for traces of the virus, and ros­tered rou­tine test­ing (RRT) is con­ducted for res­i­dents every 14 days. The RRT, in par­tic­u­lar, has helped to pick up new cases in the dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>3 TO CON­TAIN SPREAD OF VIRUS</p>
    <p>Close con­tacts will be quar­an­tined and must test neg­a­tive at the end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod be­fore they can re­turn to work. Ag­gres­sive test­ing op­er­a­tions within the dor­mi­to­ries will also be done based on the po­ten­tial risk of spread.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will con­tinue to ad­just this strat­egy as new in­sights are gained about how the virus spreads.</p>
