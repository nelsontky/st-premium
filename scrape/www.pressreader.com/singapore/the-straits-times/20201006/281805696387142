    <p>Nu­mer­ous Covid-19 drugs and ther­a­peu­tics have come into the spot­light re­cently as med­i­cal ex­perts search for ways to has­ten a pa­tient’s re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>OXY­GEN SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>Covid-19 trig­gers in­flam­ma­tion in the lungs and the pos­si­ble for­ma­tion of small blood clots, im­pair­ing the lungs’ abil­ity to take in enough oxy­gen for the body’s needs.</p>
    <p>Around 80 per cent of Covid-19 pa­tients do not re­quire sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen. How­ever, this pro­por­tion falls among older in­di­vid­u­als and peo­ple who are obese – two groups for whom the dis­ease is more se­vere.</p>
    <p>When pa­tients face res­pi­ra­tory fail­ure, they may need oxy­gen sup­port – which can in­clude in­tu­ba­tion and ven­ti­la­tor sup­port in se­ri­ous cases.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal, said: “We tend to of­fer oxy­gen sup­port when the lev­els fall to 91 per cent to 95 per cent.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, pro­gramme leader for in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said: “If oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion falls be­low 90 per cent rapidly, most in­di­vid­u­als will start to feel breath­less and ex­pe­ri­ence other symp­toms like headache or dis­ori­en­ta­tion. Pro­longed and/or pro­found oxy­gen in­suf­fi­ciency will lead to or­gan dam­age and death.”</p>
    <p>AN­TIVI­RAL DRUG REMDE­SIVIR AND STEROID DEX­AM­ETHA­SONE</p>
    <p>An­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir, which was orig­i­nally de­signed for Ebola, blocks the Covid-19 virus from repli­cat­ing in­side cells.</p>
    <p>In tri­als con­ducted by man­u­fac­turer and drug­maker Gilead Sciences, the drug was shown to be gen­er­ally ef­fec­tive, with pa­tients with mod­er­ately se­vere ill­ness – such as those re­quir­ing sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen – ben­e­fit­ing the most from it, Dr Leong said.</p>
    <p>Dex­am­etha­sone – an “old and cheap” drug used to treat se­vere asthma and se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions – is a steroid that broadly sup­presses the im­mune re­sponse of the body, Prof Hsu said.</p>
    <p>“Most of the Covid-19 pa­tients who be­come crit­i­cally ill and die do so be­cause of an aber­rant im­mune re­sponse that leads to ex­ces­sive in­flam­ma­tion in the body.”</p>
    <p>This hap­pens be­cause the hy­per­ac­tive im­mune sys­tem dam­ages cells and or­gans even as it at­tempts to elim­i­nate the in­vad­ing virus. Dex­am­etha­sone helps dampen this ex­ces­sive im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>In a large clin­i­cal trial in­volv­ing more than 6,000 Covid-19 pa­tients, Ox­ford re­searchers showed that the use of dex­am­etha­sone re­sulted in fewer deaths in those re­quir­ing oxy­gen sup­port or in­va­sive me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, both drugs are of­ten used to­gether to treat mod­er­ately or crit­i­cally ill pa­tients. How­ever, Prof Hsu and Dr Leong also added that there are no large-scale clin­i­cal tri­als to show both can and should be given to­gether.</p>
    <p>EX­PER­I­MEN­TAL AN­TI­BOD­IES COCK­TAIL</p>
    <p>This cock­tail com­prises two mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies: lab-cre­ated an­ti­bod­ies based on im­mune cells taken from con­va­les­cent pa­tients – in­clud­ing three from Sin­ga­pore – as well as mice en­gi­neered to have hu­man im­mune sys­tems.</p>
    <p>With more an­ti­bod­ies tar­get­ing dif­fer­ent sites on the virus, a cock­tail would make it more dif­fi­cult for the virus to mu­tate and es­cape the bind­ing of the an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>VI­TA­MIN D</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple stud­ies have sug­gested that hav­ing ad­e­quate amounts of vi­ta­min D may play a role in help­ing peo­ple stave off or com­bat the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But there is still no clear un­der­stand­ing of the mech­a­nism of ac­tion or de­fin­i­tive proof of clin­i­cal ben­e­fit in ran­domised clin­i­cal tri­als in­volv­ing vi­ta­min D, said Pro­fes­sor Paul Tam­byah, pres­i­dent of the Asia-Pa­cific So­ci­ety of Clin­i­cal Mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy and In­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, one study showed that pa­tients with vi­ta­min D de­fi­ciency and who were not given treat­ment for it were 1.77 times more likely to test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 than those who were not de­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>Other ther­a­peu­tics have also been used to treat Covid-19, such as zinc, which has shown some an­tivi­ral ac­tiv­ity in the lab­o­ra­tory, Prof Tam­byah said.</p>
    <p>TREAT­ING SIDE EF­FECTS AND COM­PLI­CA­TIONS</p>
    <p>Other medicines like famo­ti­dine are used to mit­i­gate some of the side ef­fects caused by drugs like dex­am­etha­sone, by pro­tect­ing the lin­ing of the stom­ach from ul­cers.</p>
    <p>Mela­tonin, a sup­ple­ment used for jet lag, is also some­times given to help pa­tients deal with drugs like steroids that cause in­som­nia Prof Tam­byah added.</p>
    <p>As­pirin is also some­times given to pre­vent blood clots that can cause strokes and heart at­tacks – a dan­ger­ous com­pli­ca­tion re­ported in Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
