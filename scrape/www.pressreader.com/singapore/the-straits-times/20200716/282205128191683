    <p>My late fa­ther, who never at­tended school, wanted me to rise a step higher than him in life. So he asked my neigh­bour, a reg­u­lar Straits Times reader, to pass his copy of the news­pa­per over to me af­ter he was done read­ing.</p>
    <p>That started my love affair with ST in 1973 at the ten­der age of six. Now that I am 53, ST is the first thing I reach for every morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Over the years, ST has im­proved my grasp of English, gen­eral knowl­edge and cur­rent af­fairs. So, a big thank you and happy birth­day on ST’s 175th an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>On the af­ter­noon of Polling Day it­self, the Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) promptly apol­o­gised to vot­ers for the longer than usual queues that vot­ers ex­pe­ri­enced that morn­ing.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia was flooded with posts by users abus­ing ELD and ac­cus­ing it of putting lives at risk and sub­ject­ing the el­derly to long hours un­der the sun.</p>
    <p>While ELD could have planned for the elec­tion bet­ter, the abuse di­rected at ELD work­ers and vol­un­teers was un­called for. It is not an easy task to plan for an elec­tion dur­ing this un­prece­dented cri­sis.</p>
    <p>My fam­ily and I would like to ex­press our grat­i­tude for the hard­work­ing work­ers and vol­un­teers from ELD for mak­ing elec­tion day as smooth as pos­si­ble for the ma­jor­ity of us. And, more im­por­tantly, for mak­ing it pos­si­ble for us to vote.</p>
    <p>I am truly thank­ful to all per­son­nel in­volved on Polling Day, in­clud­ing po­lice of­fi­cers, polling agents and clean­ers.</p>
    <p>It was a smooth and ef­fi­cient process for my­self and my fam­ily. I can fully un­der­stand the ra­tio­nale be­hind the de­ci­sion to ex­tend the polling hours.</p>
    <p>The whole polling process and se­cu­rity man­age­ment put in place due to Covid-19 were care­fully crafted. I am proud to be a Sin­ga­porean able to ex­er­cise my right to vote.</p>
    <p>I am heart­ened to know that home-grown com­pa­nies such as Phoon Huat and Prima are do­ing their best to en­sure a suf­fi­cient sup­ply of bak­ing in­gre­di­ents for Sin­ga­pore­ans dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic (Sup­ply­ing the Great Sin­ga­pore Bake Off, June 14).</p>
    <p>Though the whole­sale busi­ness is se­verely af­fected, both com­pa­nies have been able to adapt and ex­plore new fron­tiers in the re­tail mar­ket, es­pe­cially for home-based bak­ers.</p>
