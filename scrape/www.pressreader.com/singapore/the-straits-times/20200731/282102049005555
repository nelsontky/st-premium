    <p>The ma­jor­ity of prop­erty own­ers with ten­ants that qual­ify for rent re­lief un­der the amended Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act should re­ceive notices about their Govern­ment cash grants by the mid­dle of next month, the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Land­lords can­not take en­force­ment ac­tion against ten­ants that meet the cri­te­ria for re­lief for non­pay­ment of rent un­til the notices of the cash grant are is­sued, it said.</p>
    <p>The amend­ments to the Act, which pro­vide the rent re­lief frame­work for small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) and spec­i­fied non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions, come into force to­day.</p>
    <p>Land­lords with el­i­gi­ble ten­ant-oc­cu­piers will re­ceive their notices of the cash grant from the In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore from next week.</p>
    <p>This no­tice will in­form prop­erty own­ers of the rental waivers they should pro­vide ten­ants.</p>
    <p>They are re­quired to pro­vide their ten­ants with a copy of this no­tice within four work­ing days of re­ceiv­ing it, so that ten­ants will have timely con­fir­ma­tion that they are el­i­gi­ble for the rent waivers.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice of the no­tice may be done in per­son, via reg­is­tered post or by e-mail, MinLaw said.</p>
    <p>The rent re­lief frame­work will help af­fected SMEs that need more time and sup­port to re­cover from the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus out­break, as well as el­i­gi­ble non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Ten­ants and sub-ten­ants do not need to pay rent for the months cov­ered by the rent re­lief frame­work.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble ten­ants in the food and bev­er­age, and com­mer­cial sec­tors will en­joy four months of rental waivers from April to this month – two months each from the Govern­ment and the land­lord.</p>
    <p>Those in the of­fice and in­dus­trial sec­tors will get two months of rent waived for April and May – one month each from the Govern­ment and the land­lord.</p>
    <p>This is as long as their leases were ei­ther en­tered into be­fore March 25, or en­tered into be­fore March 25 but had ex­pired and re­newed ei­ther au­to­mat­i­cally or in ex­er­cise of a right of re­newal in the contract; and in force at any time be­tween April 1 and to­day for qual­i­fy­ing com­mer­cial prop­er­ties, and be­tween April 1 and May 31 for other non-res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>Once the prop­erty owner re­ceives the no­tice of the cash grant, the ap­pli­ca­ble rent and any in­ter­est payable on the rent are waived un­der the Act.</p>
    <p>Land­lords may off­set from the rental waivers any fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance, such as rental dis­counts, they had pre­vi­ously pro­vided to their ten­ants.</p>
    <p>If rent had al­ready been paid, the rental waivers should be ap­plied to the next im­me­di­ate month or months of rent. If this is not pos­si­ble, ten­ants may ob­tain a re­fund from their land­lords.</p>
    <p>Apart from the rent re­lief frame­work, busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als that are un­able to per­form their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions due to Covid-19 have other en­hanced re­liefs.</p>
    <p>Ten­ants who were un­able to va­cate their premises after the ex­piry of their lease or li­cence due to Covid-19, be­cause they were un­able to hire movers, for in­stance, will not have to pay dou­ble rent for “hold­ing over”, although some amounts will still be payable.</p>
    <p>A cap on late pay­ment in­ter­est and charges on ar­rears has been set at an amount equal to 5 per cent per an­num of sim­ple in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>This cap ap­plies to cer­tain con­tracts, in­clud­ing hire-pur­chase agree­ments for equip­ment and rental agree­ments for com­mer­cial ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Once a no­ti­fi­ca­tion for re­lief is served, the re­liefs will ap­ply for the pre­scribed pe­riod un­der the Act, which is cur­rently un­til Oct 19.</p>
