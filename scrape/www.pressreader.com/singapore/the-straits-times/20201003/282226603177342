    <p>Siloso Beach Re­sort’s largest group of work­ers never get out of bed, but are pos­si­bly the busiest and most pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>They never leave their high-rise quar­ters – black plas­tic trays, a hun­dred of them, neatly stacked on racks in­side an unas­sum­ing lit­tle hut that is nes­tled within the lush, green sur­rounds of the eco-ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Dig deeper into these trays and one will find thou­sands of slimy, wrig­gling Malaysian blue worms hard at work, eat­ing their way through fruit and veg­etable waste – some 600kg a month – from the re­sort’s restau­rants.</p>
    <p>The worms break down the food waste into ver­mi­cast – or­ganic mat­ter rich in nu­tri­ents and good bac­te­ria.</p>
    <p>With food waste be­ing one of the largest waste streams in Sin­ga­pore, es­pe­cially for the hos­pi­tal­ity and food and bev­er­age industries, ini­tia­tives such as this wormery might help close the waste loop and help the coun­try achieve its goal of be­ing a zero-waste na­tion.</p>
    <p>This act of break­ing down, or de­com­pos­ing, food waste by earth­worms is known as ver­mi­com­post­ing, and the re­sult­ing ver­mi­cast – oth­er­wise sim­ply known as worm poop – makes ex­cel­lent fer­tiliser.</p>
    <p>Earth­worms are also able to con­vert food waste faster than typ­i­cal com­post­ing bins.</p>
    <p>RIGHT AT HOME</p>
    <p>Get­ting the liv­ing con­di­tions right for the worms took much trial and er­ror by Siloso Beach Re­sort, which set up the wormery in 2012.</p>
    <p>The worms need to be kept cool, at around 26 deg C to 28 deg C, which is achieved with­out air-con­di­tion­ing by lin­ing the hut’s me­tal roof with soil and plants. The hut is en­closed with net­ting to keep in­sects and other or­gan­isms out.</p>
    <p>About 3,000 to 4,000 worms live in a tray, i n bed­ding made up mainly of peat moss – which is par­tially de­cayed veg­e­ta­tion or or­ganic mat­ter – and im­ported from East­ern Europe.</p>
    <p>A di­luted so­lu­tion of black­strap mo­lasses – a dark, vis­cous and sweet liq­uid – is added to moisten the peat moss. This also helps to feed the good bac­te­ria, which break down the food waste and fa­cil­i­tate the worms’ di­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>The bed­ding is re­freshed ev­ery three to four months.</p>
    <p>A semi-per­me­able tray lin­ing en­sures that mois­ture does not build up at the bot­tom of the tray, which would cause bad bac­te­ria to grow.</p>
    <p>A mod­u­lar sys­tem is used to pre­vent the farm’s en­tire worm pop­u­la­tion from be­ing wiped out should a prob­lem arise.</p>
    <p>Like most Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents now, the worms ad­here to “safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures”: There is no in­ter­min­gling of worms be­tween any of the 100 trays. Should a prob­lem arise in one tray, it can be eas­ily iso­lated and quickly ring-fenced.</p>
    <p>A con­trolled amount of food waste is spread out over the top of the bed­ding ev­ery two days, as too much of it would kill the worms.</p>
    <p>Be­sides plant-based kitchen scraps and left­overs, the worms can also com­post card­board and gar­den waste. The food waste must not be rot­ting.</p>
    <p>The ver­mi­cast formed is found mostly at the top of the tray as the worms tend to bur­row deeper down to avoid light.</p>
    <p>It can be eas­ily har­vested by scrap­ing the top layer off.</p>
    <p>About 3cm to 5cm deep, the ver­mi­cast, which is har­vested around once ev­ery two weeks, is odour­less and has the tex­ture of dried tea leaves.</p>
    <p>HOPE FOR THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>Food waste in Sin­ga­pore has in­creased by about 20 per cent over the last 10 years.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic gen­er­ated 744,000 tonnes of food waste last year, which is equiv­a­lent to each in­di­vid­ual dis­card­ing two bowls of food a day.</p>
    <p>Earth­worms, which have been around for cen­turies, are part of the so­lu­tion, said Mr Kelvin Ng, Siloso Beach Re­sort’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“It is through con­tin­u­ous re­search that we know how help­ful they are to us and our en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>We hope more will join us in our quest to re­duce food waste and im­prove the bio­di­ver­sity of our lo­cal flora and fauna.”</p>
    <p>The re­sort do­nates some ver­mi­cast to schools and com­mu­nity gar­dens. The worm farm also con­ducts free tours for stu­dents to help raise aware­ness about ver­mi­com­post­ing, and in­di­vid­u­als can learn how to set up their own sys­tem at home.</p>
    <p>It pre­vi­ously worked with the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Education Col­lege East to set up a wormery in the school, and with South West Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil to dis­trib­ute ver­mi­cast to nu­mer­ous com­mu­nity gar­dens.</p>

The worms will then be trans&#xAD;ferred to a tray with new, clean bed&#xAD;ding. Each tray houses about 3,000 to 4,000 worms, in the bed&#xAD;ding made up mainly of peat moss.</p>
