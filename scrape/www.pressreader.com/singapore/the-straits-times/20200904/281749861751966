    <p>Tar­geted test­ing PHILIP­PINES</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines, which has Southeast Asia’s high­est num­ber of con­firmed Covid-19 cases, ex­panded its tar­geted test­ing in June to in­clude pa­tients and health­care work­ers with no symp­toms but who had a rel­e­vant travel his­tory and had close con­tact with a con­firmed case.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has re­sisted for months calls from var­i­ous groups, and even al­lies of Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte, for mass test­ing – which means test­ing the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple. In a pol­icy pa­per re­leased by the Philip­pine Gen­eral Hospi­tal last month, it said that rou­tine mass test­ing twice a month in the hospi­tal was “not fea­si­ble” as it took more than four weeks to test some 5,000 health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>UNITED STATES</p>
    <p>Af­ter pre­vi­ously en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple with­out Covid-19 symp­toms to get tested if they have been ex­posed to some­one di­ag­nosed with the coro­n­avirus, the United States Centres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion last month mod­i­fied its guide­lines to ex­clude peo­ple who do not dis­play symp­toms – even if they have been re­cently ex­posed to the virus.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported that most US states re­jected the new guid­ance and con­tin­ued to rec­om­mend test­ing peo­ple who have been ex­posed to the virus and have no symp­toms.</p>
    <p>IN­DIA</p>
    <p>Ramp­ing up its strat­egy, the In­dian</p>
    <p>Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search on June 23 called for test­ing to “be made widely avail­able to all symp­tomatic in­di­vid­u­als in ev­ery part of the coun­try”.</p>
    <p>This marked a shift from its ear­lier ap­proach of test­ing symp­tomatic in­di­vid­u­als who meet the cri­te­ria, in­clud­ing be­ing in con­tact with a Covid-19 case.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s “ag­gres­sive test­ing” ap­proach saw more than 12 mil­lion sam­ples for the dis­ease pro­cessed in the last two weeks, Health Min­is­ter Harsh Vard­han said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In all, the coun­try of 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple has per­formed more than 45.5 mil­lion tests since Jan 22, ac­cord­ing to an up­date on the In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search’s web­site yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>BRI­TAIN</p>
    <p>The govern­ment is plan­ning to in­tro­duce mass test­ing by the end of the year to cover even peo­ple with no symp­toms, ac­cord­ing to Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock. Gen­er­ally, only peo­ple with symp­toms are cur­rently told to get them­selves tested.</p>
    <p>Mass test­ing HONG KONG</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese ter­ri­tory be­gan a free and vol­un­tary univer­sal test­ing ex­er­cise on Tues­day, and said about one-tenth of its 7.5 mil­lion peo­ple had signed up by the sec­ond day. The seven-day pro­gramme will al­low Hong Kong to con­duct up to half a mil­lion coro­n­avirus tests per day, and can be ex­tended to no more than two weeks.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts ad­vis­ing the govern­ment have said that as many as five mil­lion peo­ple might need to be tested for the scheme to com­pre­hen­sively un­cover hid­den trans­mis­sions and end the cur­rent wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>SOUTH KOREA</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, South Korea was hit by what was be­lieved to be the big­gest out­break out­side of China.</p>
    <p>But a pro­gramme of mass test­ing – which in­cluded drive-through test­ing fa­cil­i­ties – and con­tact trac­ing helped con­tain the virus.</p>
