    <p>De­spite more do­na­tions flow­ing in dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, char­ity So­cial Health Growth is strug­gling to help a grow­ing pool of peo­ple in need.</p>
    <p>It has in­ten­si­fied its on­line fundrais­ing ef­forts but the bat­tered econ­omy has been an im­ped­i­ment, said its chair­man and founder Al­son Boo.</p>
    <p>Now, it is hop­ing that the new SG Cares Giv­ing Week Fund, launched yes­ter­day, will help it get closer to achiev­ing its tar­get sum of $500,000.</p>
    <p>The money is for its 15 pro­grammes held at seven cen­tres is­land­wide that ben­e­fit more than 5,000 sin­gle as well as un­wed mums, plus un­der­priv­i­leged chil­dren and the el­derly.</p>
    <p>The new fund aims to swell the cof­fers of 30 small char­i­ties that are strug­gling amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Th­ese char­i­ties re­ceive less than $500,000 in an­nual re­ceipts, which in­clude gov­ern­ment grants, do­na­tions as well as fees and charges.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple can do­nate at giv­ing.sg/ gw­fund un­til Dec 31, and the money col­lected will be equally dis­trib­uted among the char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The un­veil­ing of the fund co­in­cides with the start of SG Cares Giv­ing Week, which was launched by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day at Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign is jointly or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Vol­un­teer and Phi­lan­thropy Cen­tre, SG Cares Of­fice and the Na­tional Coun­cil of So</p>
    <p>cial Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>It goes vir­tual this year, bring­ing per­for­mances and work­shops on­line. Pro­ceeds from re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties and ini­tia­tives from now un­til Dec 31 will also go to the SG Cares Giv­ing Week Fund.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah noted that char­i­ties face a chal­leng­ing time rais­ing funds amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic but many Sin­ga­pore­ans have been step­ping up to help peo­ple. “The spirit of car­ing had car­ried us through many chal­lenges in the past, and I am cer­tain that it con­tin­ues to do so in the cur­rent cri­sis,” she said.</p>
    <p>She high­lighted the ef­fort of non-profit Heart­ware Net­work,</p>
    <p>which is part­ner­ing stu­dents from Na­tional Ju­nior Col­lege to pre­pare and dis­trib­ute care packs to se­nior cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>“As we en­ter the fes­tive sea­son, let us not for­get to keep the giv­ing and car­ing spirit at the cen­tre of it all. To­gether, we can make a greater im­pact in help­ing the vul­ner­a­ble groups in our so­ci­ety,” Pres­i­dent Hal­imah added.</p>
    <p>An­other hope­ful ben­e­fi­ciary of the new fund is GEM New Start Cen­tre, which sup­ports young women aged be­tween 18 and 25 with em­pow­er­ing talks and a res­i­den­tial home it runs for them.</p>
    <p>The home in Thom­son takes in six to 12 in­di­vid­u­als at a time, re</p>
    <p>ferred to the cen­tre by the prison ser­vices, Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment and so­cial ser­vice agen­cies, said man­ager Doreen Lim.</p>
    <p>They stay for six months to a year and go through char­ac­ter build­ing and life skills ses­sions and vo­ca­tional skills train­ing. The cen­tre has helped more than 160 fe­males since it was founded in 2011.</p>
    <p>“We are an­tic­i­pat­ing more re­fer­rals and girls com­ing into the home, so ex­penses will be go­ing up,” Ms Lim said, adding that the pan­demic has forced it to can­cel two fund-rais­ing events this year.</p>
