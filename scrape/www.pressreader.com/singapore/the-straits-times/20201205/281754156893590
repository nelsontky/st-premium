    <p>NEW YORK • Even as the race to ap­prove and dis­trib­ute Covid-19 vac­cines is en­ter­ing its fi­nal stretch, parts of the travel in­dus­try are sprint­ing to a dif­fer­ent fin­ish line: air­port test­ing.</p>
    <p>In hubs large and small – from JFK to Bos­ton to Frankfurt, Ger­many – a va­ri­ety of com­pa­nies are fig­ur­ing out how to scale pre-flight rapid and poly­merase chain re­ac­tion Covid-19 test­ing in hopes of fa­cil­i­tat­ing safe air travel and less­en­ing quar­an­tine re­quire­ments for any­one who is not first in line for a shot.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers of that ef­fort might come as a sur­prise. In the United States, it’s XpressSpa, the pur­veyor of quickie mani-pedis and travel pil­lows. It is cur­rently op­er­a­tional in four ma­jor US air­ports, with more to come this month.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, Collinson – the par­ent com­pany of the Pri­or­ity Pass air­port lounge net­work – is the test­ing part­ner for Lon­don Heathrow and Vir­gin At­lantic, which re­cently be­gan of­fer­ing free tests for pas­sen­gers on flights to se­lect Caribbean des­ti­na­tions. This ef­fort ex­panded to three ad­di­tional Bri­tish air­ports this week.</p>
    <p>Collinson also an­nounced a part­ner­ship in mid-Novem­ber with Amer­i­can Air­lines, Bri­tish Air­ways and the Oneworld air­line al­liance that will bring test­ing to se­lect flights and hope­fully lead to the cre­ation of an “air bridge”.</p>
    <p>“We went from con­cept to pi­lot in 75 days,” said XpressSpa chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Doug Satz­man of the ef­fort’s early days. The com­pany’s first Covid-19 test­ing fa­cil­ity opened at New York’s John F. Kennedy (JFK) In­ter­na­tional Air­port in June. But ex­pand­ing has been slow work.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a tir­ing jour­ney, I won’t deny it,” said Mr David Evans, co-CEO of Collinson, whose com­pany got into the test­ing game due to its knowl­edge of air­port op­er­a­tions and its his­tory as a pur­veyor of travel in­surance. While its Heathrow ef­fort has grown from test­ing 25,000 pas­sen­gers a day to test­ing more than one mil­lion, some chal­lenges to scal­ing up are hard to over­come.</p>
    <p>Dif­fi­cul­ties have lit­tle to do with square footage or money. Cre­at­ing air­port test­ing sites, Mr Evans said, is a low-cost propo­si­tion that can fill any empty or un­der­utilised space, of which there are many in air­ports to­day. It is the lack of co­or­di­nated pol­icy around test­ing re­quire­ments that has thwarted any type of global (or even coun­try-wide) ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>“If they rolled out a na­tional test­ing man­date for air travel, we’d be there to sup­port in as many air­ports as pos­si­ble,” added Mr Evans, who has been lob­by­ing vo­cif­er­ously for that ex­act ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Both ex­ec­u­tives say air­port test­ing will be a longterm need, rel­e­vant for at least the next two years and pos­si­bly far longer.</p>
