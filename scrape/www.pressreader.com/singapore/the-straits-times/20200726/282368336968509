    <p>While restau­rant chefs and own­ers were scram­bling to trans­form their busi­nesses from dine-in to take­away and de­liv­ery dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, a rev­o­lu­tion was hap­pen­ing in home kitchens across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Cooks and bak­ers were do­ing a roar­ing trade sup­ply­ing hun­gry – and bored – Sin­ga­pore­ans stuck at home.</p>
    <p>There was, of course, a heart­stop­ping mo­ment for these en­trepreneur­s, be­cause home-based food busi­nesses had to cease and de­sist when en­hanced cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were an­nounced in the later part of April. When they could start op­er­at­ing from May 12, there was no hold­ing back.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, there have al­ways been home-based food busi­nesses – peo­ple who make cook­ies, cakes and other food for fes­tive oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>But the coro­n­avirus pan­demic un­leashed a tidal wave of such out­fits, with many start­ing up in April and May.</p>
    <p>The en­trepreneur­s be­hind them know ex­actly how to tar­get their au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Some of­fer baked goods that are hav­ing a mo­ment, like Basque cheese­cakes. Oth­ers put a spin on clas­sics – truf­fle cane­les and Mao Shan Wang cane­les, for ex­am­ple. Yet oth­ers mod­ernise tra­di­tion – parme­san mu­rukku.</p>
    <p>Savvy busi­ness own­ers also make sure their food looks good. How do you jazz up a pork and chive dumpling? Tinge the hand­made skin with pink at the edges. In­stant click bait. And, of course, com­fort al­ways sells. Who would say no to a slab of ten­der braised pork belly? Or beef Welling­ton?</p>
    <p>Such busi­nesses are fast be­com­ing an im­por­tant part of Sin­ga­pore’s food scene; a force to be reck­oned with, judg­ing from the qual­ity of the food, the swish pack­ag­ing and the mostly ef­fi­cient way of tak­ing and de­liv­er­ing or­ders. Or­der­ing food on­line in­ten­si­fied dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, and peo­ple are not let­ting go of this new habit.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, a na­tion of peo­ple con­stantly in search of the next hot thing to eat, has em­braced these up­starts so thor­oughly that many wait pa­tiently by their lap­tops for or­der­ing win­dows to open. Many of the busi­nesses have a wait list.</p>
    <p>The 12 brands The Sun­day Times spoke to re­port that or­ders have not let up, even though dine-in at hawker cen­tres, cof­fee shops and restau­rants has been al­lowed since June 19.</p>
    <p>All said they in­tend to con­tinue do­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>HUNGER MAR­KET­ING</p>
    <p>The i ngre­di­ents for the per­fect storm helped home-based food busi­nesses take off like never be­fore.</p>
    <p>The big­gest fac­tor ap­pears to be the cir­cuit breaker re­stric­tions on din­ing out and plain go­ing out. Stay home was the mes­sage, and Sin­ga­pore­ans heard it loud and clear. But they also had to keep them­selves and their fam­ily mem­bers fed and wa­tered.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, so­cial me­dia was flooded with im­ages of beau­ti­ful baked goods and com­fort food. It was clever hunger mar­ket­ing – cre­at­ing de­sire with im­ages cal­cu­lated to elicit an emo­tional re­sponse, to trig­ger buy­ing. All a hun­gry per­son had to do was scroll through the com­ments and pick and choose ac­cord­ing to the yeas and nays.</p>
    <p>The food could all be or­dered eas­ily on­line and paid for elec­tron­i­cally via PayNow, PayLah or bank trans­fers.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who lost jobs in the pan­demic turned to de­liv­er­ing parcels and food to make ends meet, giv­ing food busi­nesses more ways to get their prod­uct to cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>When boast­ing on so­cial me­dia about get­ting into a hot restau­rant is not pos­si­ble, the next best thing would be to score an im­pos­si­ble-to­get box of pas­tries or a su­per luxe steamed radish cake that a celebrity had posted on In­sta­gram. Or a trio of truf­fle cane­les.</p>
    <p>Word of mouth helped busi­nesses take flight, and In­sta­gram be­came the plat­form of choice for many of them.</p>
    <p>Then cer­tain brands started get­ting so pop­u­lar it be­came im­pos­si­ble to get their wares. “Sold out” is a hunger mar­keter’s dream. There is noth­ing like scarcity to whet the ap­petite.</p>
    <p>“Fomo,” says one busi­ness owner, us­ing the acro­nym for “fear of miss­ing out”, when asked what he thinks drives sales.</p>
    <p>SIDE HUS­TLE</p>
    <p>The peo­ple be­hind the busi­nesses come from di­verse back­grounds, and started their brands for dif­fer­ent rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Yue, 39, started Lor Bak Mama in late May be­cause her nail salon, Doll­house Nails in CityLink Mall, was closed to cus­tomers dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The mother of one says: “Due to Covid-19, my nail busi­ness be­gan suf­fer­ing losses in Fe­bru­ary. We had zero in­come, while still in­cur­ring over­heads. I wanted to cover some of my busi­ness ex­penses and re­tain my staff. I also have a baby at home. This was the only way I could think of to earn some sup­ple­men­tary in­come.”</p>
    <p>Se­nior le­gal sec­re­tary Brindha Vish­wanathan, 62, wanted a project to keep ac­tive when she segues into re­tire­ment. She started Bat­ter Mat­ters in March, sell­ing mu­rukku, a spicy, savoury In­dian snack.</p>
    <p>Bud­ding cor­po­rate lawyer Liow Xuan Rong, 25, used to make dumplings when she was study­ing in Lon­don, and started Dizzy Dumplings in the mid­dle of last month to turn that hobby into a small busi­ness. She is keep­ing her day job; mak­ing her pork and chive dumplings dur­ing week­ends and de­liv­er­ing them on Sun­days.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers were look­ing to tran­si­tion into new ca­reers.</p>
    <p>Mr Pah Qi Fan, 27, grad­u­ated from the Culi­nary In­sti­tute of Amer­ica in Sin­ga­pore in 2016, and was a mar­ket­ing man­ager in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try. He started The Crane Grain last month, sell­ing Basque cheese­cakes and salt-sprin­kled dark choco­late chip cook­ies, and has since quit his day job to fo­cus on the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Cousins I-Wen Whang, 24, and Jonathan Tang, 27, both of whom went to univer­sity in the United States, started Able Bagel in April be­cause they missed the bagels they en­joyed there and also wanted to raise money for their favourite causes.</p>
    <p>All these busi­nesses op­er­ate un­der the Hous­ing Board and Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s schemes for home-based busi­nesses. The Sin­ga­pore Food Agency has a list of food safety guide­lines they have to stick to, plus ad­di­tional ones for the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, only peo­ple in the same house­hold can be in­volved in the busi­ness, they have to en­sure that de­liv­ery or col­lec­tion is con­tact­less and there can be no phys­i­cal ex­change of cash, among other rules.</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING CURVE</p>
    <p>Their sto­ries and back­grounds are di­verse, but many of them had the same thought when they started: What if peo­ple do not like my food?</p>
    <p>Ms Kyer Say, 31, started Tiky Mochi Muf­fin in Fe­bru­ary to sell the mochi muffins she had cre­ated be­cause she loves the chewy tex­ture of the rice-flour treats she had on reg­u­lar trips to Ja­pan and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>She says: “I wasn’t sure if mochi is well-liked by Sin­ga­pore­ans. Even though my friends and fam­ily had given me ex­cel­lent feed­back, I felt my bakes weren’t good enough and was wor­ried that cus­tomers may not en­joy them.”</p>
    <p>Ms Karen Yuen, who is in her 30s and a for­mer mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor for a cruise com­pany, started MunchKins in De­cem­ber last year to sell the steamed car­rot cake she recre­ated from mem­o­ries of watch­ing her grand­mother make the savoury cakes, and of eat­ing them.</p>
    <p>“I’ll be ner­vous af­ter my cus­tomers pick up the food and al­ways ask them for feed­back. And when they say nice things, I’m also quite wor­ried that they are do­ing the ‘paiseh thumbs-up’,” she says. “But it has been very en­cour­ag­ing so far.”</p>
    <p>The en­trepreneur­s also face de­mand and sup­ply is­sues.</p>
    <p>Oc­cu­pa­tional ther­a­pist Sa­muel Lam, 30, who started Small Town Sour­dough last month to sell loaves of his bread, made with flour he mills him­self at home, says: “Sourc­ing qual­ity flour and whole grains for milling has been a chal­lenge. When I find what I’m look­ing for, I usu­ally try to buy in bulk.”</p>
    <p>Lor Bak Mama’s Ms Yue adds: “In</p>
    <p>the be­gin­ning, it was def­i­nitely about main­tain­ing food qual­ity while cook­ing in big quan­ti­ties and get­ting our food de­liv­ered promptly. I was also wor­ried about de­mand, as lor bak is a very home­cooked dish and ev­ery­one has their own recipe. So I wasn’t sure if peo­ple would pur­chase it from a home-based busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“I also re­alised it is dif­fi­cult to or­der stock be­cause you have to gauge de­mand and make sure you have enough space at home to keep the in­gre­di­ents fresh.”</p>
    <p>Ms Jane Ng, 36, whose Keen Bak­ery sells dairy-, gluten- and soya-free bakes, adds: “I don’t bake with reg­u­lar wheat flour, so it’s more dif­fi­cult to source all my in­gre­di­ents and I usu­ally have to go to mul­ti­ple shops. As a home baker, I don’t have the space to keep a mas­sive stock of in­gre­di­ents on hand. So it’s hard to find that sweet spot of ‘just enough’ sup­plies.”</p>
    <p>CUS­TOMER 101</p>
    <p>The caged Sin­ga­porean is an ap­pre­cia­tive Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>Ms May Young, 36, whose Bolog­nai­ise sells Bolog­nese sauce, made with pork and beef and sim­mered over six hours, roast chicken, beef Welling­ton and other com­fort food, says: “It has been a re­ward­ing jour­ney; long con­ver­sa­tions with cus­tomers who re­ally make the ef­fort to pro­vide con­struc­tive feed­back and share pho­tos and com­pli­ments.”</p>
    <p>Keen Bak­ery’s Ms Ng adds: “Sin­ga­pore cus­tomers will buy any­thing In­sta­grammable or hard to ob­tain. My mini bundts are quite pop­u­lar be­cause they’re In­sta­grammable.”</p>
    <p>The move­ment to eat more healthily did not wane dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Small Town Sour­dough’s Mr Lam says: “There is a grow­ing num­ber of like-minded food­ies who ap­pre­ci­ate where food comes from and want to eat well-crafted bread which is healthy and tasty.”</p>
    <p>Able Bagel has also found a broad­minded au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness has given money to or­gan­i­sa­tions do­ing work for mi­nor­ity groups in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas. Ben­e­fi­cia­ries have in­cluded gen­der equal­ity ad­vo­cacy group Aware; Hagar, an in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tion that works to rid the world of hu­man traf­fick­ing, slav­ery and abuse; New Naratif, which is work­ing to­wards free­dom of ex­pres­sion and in­for­ma­tion in South-east Asia; and the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion for the Ad­vance­ment of Col­ored Peo­ple in the US.</p>
    <p>Ms Whang says: “We have been do­nat­ing to many mi­nor­ity and marginalis­ed groups in need, and we’re thrilled to see our cus­tomers show­ing their sup­port for these groups of peo­ple. Ad­mit­tedly, we’re some­times un­sure of how our con­sumers might re­act to our ben­e­fi­ciary choices, but their sup­port has been re­as­sur­ing.”</p>
    <p>And then there is the con­fir­ma­tion that Sin­ga­pore is, in­deed, a food-mad na­tion.</p>
    <p>Munch-Kins’ Ms Yuen says: “Food re­ally binds Sin­ga­pore­ans, es­pe­cially dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod. It is heart-warm­ing when we get a re­peat or­der, just sec­onds af­ter a cus­tomer takes his first bite.</p>
    <p>“We had texts say­ing, ‘I just took a bite and I knew I had to or­der two more im­me­di­ately. I’ve got two friends that I know would go crazy for this’. This re­ally gives us the mo­ti­va­tion to keep go­ing.”</p>
    <p>FU­TURE SO BRIGHT</p>
    <p>All the en­trepreneur­s in­ter­viewed say they are work­ing to ex­pand their menus.</p>
    <p>Lor Bak Mama’s Ms Yue re­cently gave sam­ples of her chilli dip to reg­u­lar cus­tomers for feed­back. There might be dou­ble-boiled soups in the fu­ture too.</p>
    <p>Munch-Kins will of­fer fruit cake for Christ­mas, and Dizzy Dumpling’s Ms Liow is test­ing new fill­ings for her dumplings. The Crane Grain’s Mr Pah is work­ing on a tast­ing box of pas­tries, and Able Bagel is look­ing to of­fer oat­milk cold brew cof­fee to go with the bagels.</p>
    <p>Ms Young from Bolog­nai­ise says she is look­ing for a com­mer­cial kitchen space to scale up her op­er­a­tions to do de­liv­ery and take­away, and hopes to do that by Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Not all of them are keen to set up dine-in restau­rants or shopfronts, know­ing they can keep over­heads and op­er­a­tions lean and mean with­out the bur­den of deal­ing with land­lords and grap­pling with scarce man­power.</p>
    <p>The days sound tough – hand­chop­ping in­gre­di­ents, wak­ing up at 3am to bake, man­ag­ing lo­gis­tics, test­ing new prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>But this is worth­while work, they say.</p>
    <p>Tiky Mochi Muf­fin’s Ms Say says: “This busi­ness has be­come my full­time job and I bake for 10 to 12 hours a day, five days a week. It has con­sumed ev­ery bit of my time. I have no per­sonal life.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, I’m ex­hausted, but it brings my life so much mean­ing and joy. It also pro­vides a sup­ple­men­tary in­come for my fam­ily, which is won­der­ful.”</p>
    <p>Ms Vish­wanathan from Bat­ter Mat­ters adds: “I have found new mean­ing in life. The busi­ness has en­cour­aged me to up­grade my skills and taught me to be­come more dig­i­tally ready and lit­er­ate. I have learnt how to use In­sta­gram and In­ter­net lingo, and watched a lot of YouTube videos to learn how to take pho­tos that are aes­thet­i­cally pleas­ing to the so­cial-me­dia gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“With­out even re­al­is­ing, I also started un­der­stand­ing dif­fer­ent as­pects of the busi­ness, such as lo­gis­tics, brand­ing, cus­tomer ser­vice and work­ing with dif­fer­ent part­ners to get my prod­uct to the cus­tomer in a timely man­ner.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, I would re­turn home from work and watch tele­vi­sion shows. But now, I am more phys­i­cally and men­tally ac­tive. I’m con­stantly think­ing about the busi­ness, man­ag­ing or­ders, plan­ning my sched­ule, com­ing up with a so­cial­me­dia plan – it keeps me very ac­tive.</p>
    <p>“I have also made friends with fel­low home-based busi­ness own­ers and widened my so­cial net­work. Start­ing the busi­ness has im­proved my qual­ity of life.”</p>
