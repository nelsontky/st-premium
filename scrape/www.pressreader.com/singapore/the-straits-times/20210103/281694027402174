    <p>•</p>
    <p>BANGKOK Bangkok’s nightlife went quiet yes­ter­day as a ban on bars, night­clubs and restau­rant al­co­hol sales took ef­fect, among a raft of re­stric­tions aimed at curb­ing the coun­try’s ris­ing coro­n­avirus toll.</p>
    <p>Thai­land ini­tially ap­peared to have es­caped the worst of the virus, reg­is­ter­ing just un­der 4,000 to­tal cases in Novem­ber, de­spite be­com­ing the se­cond coun­try to de­tect an in­fec­tion early last year.</p>
    <p>But an out­break last month at a mas­sive seafood mar­ket has spi­ralled into a resur­gence, with in­fec­tions now de­tected in 53 of the coun­try’s 77 prov­inces. The caseload j umped to over 7,300 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In Bangkok, where more than 2,600 ac­tive cases have been de­tected, city au­thor­i­ties acted swiftly and an­nounced a par­tial lock­down to go into ef­fect. Bars and night­clubs, box­ing sta­di­ums, cock­fight­ing rings and mas­sage par­lours – as well as beauty sa­lons and gyms – will be among a slew of busi­nesses af­fected.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal an­nounced on Fri­day that public schools would close for two weeks, while more than a dozen virus check­points were set up yes­ter­day across the city.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to use ex­treme mea­sures like a l ock­down and putting up a cur­few, but we need a stronger medicine to pre­vent the new surge,” said Mr Taweesin Visanuyoth­in, a spokesman for Thai­land’s Covid-19 task force.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide re­stric­tions and clo­sures are ex­pected from Jan 4 to Feb 1, he added, al­low­ing a two-day “grace pe­riod” for busi­ness own­ers to pre­pare.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties, wor­ried about in­cit­ing alarm na­tion­wide, had been re­luc­tant to clas­sify the new emer­gence of the virus as a “se­cond wave”.</p>
    <p>But anger re­sounded across Thai</p>
    <p>so­cial me­dia yes­ter­day over the re­newed re­stric­tions, with busi­ness own­ers ex­press­ing frus­tra­tion with the par­tial lock­down.</p>
    <p>“I com­ply with the mea­sures strictly, yet I now need to close my busi­ness while there are many</p>
    <p>peo­ple scram­bling on the sky­train ev­ery day,” spa owner Ak­sika Chan­tarawinji wrote on the of­fi­cial Face­book page of Bangkok’s gover­nor.</p>
    <p>The par­tial lock­down also comes dur­ing a pe­riod of rel­a­tive calm in Bangkok, fol­low­ing months of</p>
    <p>demon­stra­tions that drew thou­sands to the streets to de­mand govern­ment over­haul and royal re­form.</p>
    <p>The lat­est event or­gan­ised by the pro-democ­racy move­ment was last Thurs­day, dur­ing which</p>
    <p>ac­tivists sold seafood to aid em­bat­tled shrimp ven­dors af­ter the mar­ket out­break.</p>
    <p>Police tried to shut down the event and more than a dozen or­gan­is­ers – af­fil­i­ated with “We Vol­un­teer”, a group that pro­vides</p>
    <p>se­cu­rity for the ac­tivists – were ar­rested and charged with break­ing coro­n­avirus rules. Re­leased on bail yes­ter­day evening, they were greeted with cheers from sup­port­ers wait­ing out­side the court.</p>
