    <p>After ap­ply­ing to nearly 50 firms in Ja­pan and over­seas, Ms Ayaka Nakamura fi­nally got a job of­fer as an as­so­ciate at a Tokyo re­search firm.</p>
    <p>This was de­spite her as­pi­ra­tions to work in jour­nal­ism, ei­ther at a news­pa­per or on­line me­dia firm.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly I was very an­gry when I was re­jected the first time, but after fac­ing dozens of re­jec­tions, I got used to the feel­ing,” the 23-yearold told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“Maybe I can af­ford to think pos­i­tively be­cause I have a job now. If I did not, I would have been ex­hausted.”</p>
    <p>She also counts her bless­ings to be able to work for the Tokyo com­pany as it al­lows her to tele­work full time, mean­ing she would not have to move out of her fam­ily home in western Ja­pan, which she also shares with her grand­par­ents.</p>
    <p>Ms Nakamura con­fesses that Covid-19 has made her value her fam­ily’s pres­ence more, adding: “My ideal lifestyle has changed.”</p>
    <p>So has her idea of work. Rather than rely on one source of in­come, Ms Nakamura thinks it is im­por­tant to “se­cure mul­ti­ple sources of in­come”. She wants to find a sec­ond job, pos­si­bly as a free­lance writer, and has also be­gun in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>“Right now, it is re­ally hard to be op­ti­mistic about our fu­ture and I would not say that ev­ery­thing is go­ing to be fine,” she said. “But I un­der­stand that I am ex­tremely lucky to be given a full-time po­si­tion dur­ing a global pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Her story is com­mon across Ja­pan, where the Covid-19 pan­demic is forc­ing many youth to adapt and change their pri­or­i­ties to avoid fall­ing into the trap of a so­called “em­ploy­ment ice age”.</p>
    <p>Such an “ice age” has hap­pened once be­fore – when the as­set bub­ble in the 1990s burst and caused a lost gen­er­a­tion of Ja­panese – with ugly con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>There are no firm es­ti­mates of how many peo­ple were di­rectly af­fected, but th­ese peo­ple who left school be­tween the mid-1990s and mid-2000s would be aged 35 to 44 today. The Ja­panese govern­ment last year vowed to spend 65 bil­lion yen (S$836 mil­lion) un­til 2022 to help 300,000 peo­ple in this group land full-time jobs.</p>
    <p>Those in this “ice age” are stuck in a vi­cious cir­cle of ir­reg­u­lar, con­tract em­ploy­ment, flit­ting from one low-wage, dead-end part-time job to an­other.</p>
    <p>Ir­reg­u­lar work­ers are paid less than their full-time reg­u­lar col­leagues even for do­ing the same work. They also do not qual­ify for ben­e­fits like pen­sions or bonuses, nor have clear job prospects.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gists have stud­ied the spillover ef­fects. With­out job cer­tainty or sav­ings, it be­comes dif­fi­cult to form a fam­ily, thus fu­elling a de­mo­graphic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say Ja­pan’s cur­rent de­mo­graphic cri­sis is likely a di­rect con­se­quence of the em­ploy­ment ice age, with the pan­demic set to worsen the dis­mal birth rates. The Health Min­istry es­ti­mates that there will likely be an all-time low of 845,000 new­borns this year, with fewer than 800,000 ba­bies born next year if cur­rent trends per­sist.</p>
    <p>Chuo Univer­sity Pro­fes­sor Masahiro Ya­mada told The Sun­day Times: “Many Ja­panese are riska­verse, and if they are be­set with fi­nan­cial un­cer­tainty, they will see mar­riage and child­birth as risks.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s over­all un­em­ploy­ment rate stood at 3 per cent in Septem­ber, un­changed from Au­gust and the high­est since May 2017. But this fig­ure was driven up by job­less youth, who have been dis­pro­por­tion­ately hit by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Only two age groups had a job­less rate of above 3 per cent – those aged 25 to 34, at 4.8 per cent, and those aged 15 to 24, at 4.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber last year, the over­all job­less rate was 2.2 per cent. The 15 to 24 and 25 to 34 age groups stood at 3.0 per cent each.</p>
    <p>An ex­pert panel ad­vis­ing the Labour Min­istry last month urged more sup­port for job-hunt­ing youth, as the in­for­mal job of­fer rate for univer­sity se­niors who will leave school in March fell be­low 70 per cent for the first time in years.</p>
    <p>“Some in­dus­tries have been down­siz­ing re­cruit­ment,” a labour min­istry of­fi­cial told the Asahi Shim­bun. “Cor­po­rate re­cruit­ment ses­sions are be­ing can­celled, and with that, univer­sity stu­dents be­gan job hunt­ing later than usual.”</p>
    <p>The an­nual mass re­cruit­ment blitz is a relic of tra­di­tional life­long em­ploy­ment, where many Ja­panese firms have the ten­dency to value fresh grad­u­ates more highly as they are seen as more “em­ploy­able”. Thus, youth who fail to get jobs dur­ing their “turn” con­tinue to be passed over in favour of newer gen­er­a­tions of school-leavers.</p>
    <p>In line with this, the Labour Min­istry has sug­gested com­pa­nies en­sure young grad­u­ates can ap­ply for jobs – and be treated as fresh grad­u­ates – for three years.</p>
    <p>“We have grave con­cerns about the in­crease in youth un­em­ploy­ment and the take-up of part-time work as the num­ber of full-time job of­fers is rapidly shrink­ing,” the ex­pert panel said last month.</p>
    <p>“Se­cur­ing sta­ble em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for youth is an im­por­tant so­cial task not only for sus­tain­able eco­nomic growth, but also for stop­ping pop­u­la­tion de­cline and cre­at­ing a vir­tu­ous cy­cle.”</p>
    <p>As it is, among those who grad­u­ated in March this year, 201 have had their job of­fers can­celled, while 1,291 grad­u­ates have had the start of their em­ploy­ment de­layed.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 cri­sis has pre­sented it­self as an op­por­tu­nity for some, like 27-year-old Mr Kohei Nak­a­gawa, who will be grad­u­at­ing with a de­gree in ac­count­ing and fi­nance next year. He was able to land a job in his area of in­ter­est of risk ad­vi­sory con­sult­ing. He said: “Covid-19 has taught us that en­ter­prise risk man­age­ment is im­por­tant and its de­mand is only set to in­crease over the next decade.”</p>
    <p>It is hard to be op­ti­mistic about our fu­ture... But I un­der­stand that I am ex­tremely lucky to be given a full-time po­si­tion dur­ing a ’’ global pan­demic.</p>
