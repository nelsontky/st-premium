    <p>Mr Andy Lim first delved into the world of big data while work­ing as an en­gi­neer at an air­line. At the time, he pre­dicted im­pend­ing faults on planes so timely ser­vic­ing could be done to min­imise down­time. He also an­a­lysed data to make busi­ness fore­casts and max­imise cost sav­ings.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old’s in­ter­est was piqued, but he felt he was “just scratch­ing the sur­face”. He re­alised there was so much more to big data, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and ma­chine learn­ing. “So in­stead of be­ing in the pas­sen­ger seat of the dig­i­tal revo­lu­tion, I de­cided to make the switch (to data an­a­lyt­ics),” he says.</p>
    <p>The ca­reer tran­si­tion was a big step and Mr Lim wanted to be pre­pared. He did a lot of re­search and at­tended in­tro­duc­tory ses­sions or­gan­ised by lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties be­fore de­cid­ing on the NUSISS’ (In­sti­tute of Sys­tems Science at Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore) Master of Tech­nol­ogy in En­ter­prise Busi­ness An­a­lyt­ics (MTech EBAC).</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme aims to meet in­dus­try de­mand for data sci­en­tists who can help or­gan­i­sa­tions cre­ate busi­ness value through strate­gic use of data, an­a­lyt­ics, mod­els and front-line tools.</p>
    <p>Cour­ses are taught by lec­tur­ers with in­dus­try knowl­edge, and the pro­gramme is avail­able as a full-time (one year) or part-time (two years) course. A cen­tral el­e­ment is the cap­stone project, which in­cludes a three­month in­tern­ship at spon­sor­ing com­pa­nies for full-time stu­dents.</p>
    <p>On­line learn­ing</p>
    <p>Mr Lim en­rolled full-time in MTech EBAC in July 2019. Hav­ing no rel­e­vant back­ground, he took up on­line cour­ses on pro­gram­ming and ma­chine learn­ing on the ad­vice of his lec­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>His in­tern­ship was spent work­ing on a project at the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA), where he used his data an­a­lyt­ics skills in a study on com­muter travel pat­terns.</p>
    <p>“As a public trans­port user, this was a topic I could re­late to, and it al­lowed me to tap my per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ences. It was mean­ing­ful to par­take in a project that could po­ten­tially help im­prove the daily com­mute of Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he says.</p>
    <p>At the end of his in­tern­ship, he re­ceived a job of­fer from LTA and now works as a data an­a­lyst in its Data Science Divi­sion.</p>
