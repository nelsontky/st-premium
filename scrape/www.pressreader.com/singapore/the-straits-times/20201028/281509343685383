    <p>Malaysia’s po­lice force is un­der se­vere strain from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with up to 10,000 per­son­nel un­der quar­an­tine and 200 of­fi­cers un­der­go­ing treat­ment af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus, re­ported The Star.</p>
    <p>Home Min­is­ter Hamzah Zain­udin said po­lice per­son­nel have been the most af­fected ow­ing to the na­ture of their work, en­forc­ing move­ment con­trols im­posed to stop the spread of the virus. “The Covid-19 out­break started in Malaysia in early Fe­bru­ary with the num­ber of pos­i­tive pa­tients ac­cu­mu­lat­ing to about 10,000 in seven months. But dur­ing the cur­rent third wave of the pan­demic, it has touched about 11,000 in just two weeks,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry re­ported 835 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, rais­ing the to­tal to 28,640. Two new fa­tal­i­ties were recorded, rais­ing the death toll to 238.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Star, the po­lice con­sider the strain on their man­power a se­cu­rity con­cern.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Hamzah said dras­tic mea­sures were needed, and that it was sub­jec­tive as to whether ex­ist­ing pub­lic health laws were suf­fi­cient to tackle resur­gent in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In­di­rectly re­fer­ring to the gov­ern­ment’s failed at­tempt to im­pose emer­gency mea­sures, he said Malaysians should try to bet­ter un­der­stand why the gov­ern­ment needs ex­tra tools to com­bat the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics said the mea­sures would have al­lowed Par­lia­ment to be sus­pended and Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to avoid fac­ing a vote in the Lower House.</p>
    <p>“This is not about pol­i­tics or help­ing cer­tain politi­cians to be­come prime min­is­ter. This is about sav­ing lives,” said Mr Hamzah.</p>
    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s third wave of coro­n­avirus out­breaks has taken its toll on front-line work­ers, with up to 10,000 po­lice per­son­nel un­der quar­an­tine and med­i­cal staff and health work­ers among the hard­est hit.</p>
    <p>More than 200 po­lice of­fi­cers have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and are un­der­go­ing treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The large num­bers have put a huge strain on the de­ploy­ment of per­son­nel, and the po­lice are now con­sid­er­ing the sit­u­a­tion a se­cu­rity con­cern.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Home Min­is­ter Hamzah Zain­udin con­firmed that the pan­demic had placed a se­ri­ous strain on po­lice man­power and their work. He said po­lice per­son­nel had been the most ex­posed to the virus be­cause of the na­ture of their work.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has seen new daily cases hit record lev­els in the past week, spik­ing at 1,240 in­fec­tions on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the health min­istry re­ported 835 new coro­n­avirus cases, rais­ing the to­tal to 28,640 in­fec­tions. Two new fa­tal­i­ties were recorded, tak­ing the to­tal num­ber of deaths to 238.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 out­break started in Malaysia in early Fe­bru­ary with the num­ber of pos­i­tive pa­tients ac­cu­mu­lat­ing to about 10,000 in seven months. But dur­ing the cur­rent third wave of the pan­demic, it</p>
    <p>touched about 11,000 in just two weeks,” Datuk Seri Hamzah said.</p>
    <p>Pay­ing tribute to the po­lice force, Mr Hamzah said many of them had worked tire­lessly and had not taken any days off or leave in the past 10 months.</p>
    <p>“Many of our po­lice­men have been in­fected be­cause their work re­quires them to be in red zone ar­eas dur­ing op­er­a­tions and checks. They are also ex­posed when they man the 500-over road­blocks set up since the pan­demic hit Malaysia, es­pe­cially dur­ing the move­ment con­trol or­der phase,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that the po­lice­men wore masks, but their jobs re­quired them to stand close to the peo­ple they spoke to.</p>
    <p>“So­cial dis­tanc­ing is not some­thing that can be per­fectly prac­tised when you are a po­lice of­fi­cer in that sit­u­a­tion,” he told The Star.</p>
    <p>Health di­rec­tor-gen­eral Noor</p>
    <p>Hisham Ab­dul­lah had said weeks ago that front-lin­ers had to keep bat­tling the pan­demic de­spite be­ing tired.</p>
    <p>“To all our front-lin­ers, we have a huge bat­tle ahead of us. Our coun­try de­pends on us de­spite many sleep­less nights and chronic fa­tigue,” he had tweeted.</p>
    <p>Mr Hamzah said that po­lice re­sources had been “stretched to the fullest” as the force had been help­ing im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers ap­pre­hend for­eign­ers en­ter­ing the coun­try il­le­gally.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve many of th­ese il­le­gals are also Covid-19 car­ri­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also in­di­rectly re­ferred to the gov­ern­ment’s pro­posal to im­ple­ment emer­gency mea­sures to tackle the pan­demic, which was re­jected by the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics said the mea­sures would have al­lowed Par­lia­ment to be sus­pended and Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to avoid fac­ing a bud­get vote.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing Malaysians to bet­ter un­der­stand why the gov­ern­ment needed ex­tra tools to fight the pan­demic, Mr Hamzah said it was sub­jec­tive as to whether ex­ist­ing laws such as the Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol of In­fec­tious Dis­eases Act 1988 were suf­fi­cient to tackle the resur­gent in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“We are run­ning out of time. This is not about pol­i­tics or help­ing cer­tain politi­cians to be­come prime min­is­ter. This is about sav­ing lives as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases will keep go­ing up un­less we do some­thing dras­tic,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Hamzah said Malaysians should stay united in com­bat­ing the virus, adding that “it was not the time for un­nec­es­sary pol­i­tick­ing”.</p>
