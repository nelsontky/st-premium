    <p>Seventy-two hours after their rad­i­cal plans for ma­jor changes in English football be­came pub­lic, the Amer­i­can own­ers of Liver­pool and Manch­ester United were given a blunt re­minder on Wed­nes­day of the sim­ple re­al­ity of the very power struc­ture they have sought to over­turn.</p>
    <p>“Project Big Pic­ture” called for the six big­gest clubs in the Premier League, along with three other long-term mem­bers, to be given “spe­cial vot­ing rights” that would ef­fec­tively put them in com­mand of the world’s most com­mer­cially suc­cess­ful football league – and leave the rest as sec­ond-class pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>But the ob­vi­ous prob­lem was that in or­der to bring that power shift about, 14 votes out of 20 clubs were needed and un­sur­pris­ingly the Tur­keys did not vote for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Given such a clear and ob­vi­ous ob­sta­cle, the plans to re­duce the size of the league from 20 to 18 and hand a big­ger share of rev­enue and power to the big­gest clubs, were des­tined to fail, and the ques­tion is why were ob­vi­ously in­tel­li­gent busi­ness­men en­gaged in such a Kamikaze mis­sion?</p>
    <p>The plan’s back­ers ap­pear to have badly mis­cal­cu­lated how pub­lic opin­ion and the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment would re­act to their pro­pos­als but even as they lick their wounds, the indication­s are that they are ready to fight on.</p>
    <p>Sources close to the project ar­gue that the Premier League’s an</p>
    <p>nounce­ment of a new strate­gic re­view of the game’s struc­tures and fi­nances would not have hap­pened with­out their ef­forts and they be­lieve that process will al­low them to push for­ward with their pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>In­deed, far from be­ing a de­fin­i­tive end to talk of power shifts and even break­aways, Wed­nes­day’s re­jec­tion of the project is likely just a cease­fire ahead of fu­ture bat­tles.</p>
    <p>But if the big clubs are to get their way on their main is­sues of pri­or­ity – a smaller league with fewer games, and more power and money for the “star at­trac­tions” – they will now re­alise they face for­mi­da­ble op­po­si­tion. It was clear from the in­volve­ment of English Football League (EFL) chair­man Rick Parry that the sales pitch would fo­cus on the pro­pos­als as a way to deal with the fi­nan­cial trou­bles fac­ing the 72 clubs in the sec­ond, third and fourth tiers.</p>
    <p>In terms of his con­stituency, the EFL clubs, the prom­ise of a £250 mil­lion (S$442 mil­lion) “res­cue fund” and a six-fold in­crease in their share of rev­enues were un­sur­pris­ingly mu­sic to their ears.</p>
    <p>Given pub­lic opin­ion tends to be sym­pa­thetic to small clubs and the gov­ern­ment had pre­vi­ously urged the Premier League to help out the strug­gling teams in the Covid cri­sis, Parry and the project’s in­sti­ga­tors were bank­ing on a groundswel­l of sup­port for their plans.</p>
    <p>But while the Premier League’s con­dem­na­tion of the plan was pre­dictable, Parry ap­peared sur­prised that the gov­ern­ment im­me­di­ately de­nounced it as a “back­room deal”.</p>
    <p>The me­dia chose to fo­cus on the “power grab” as­pect of the pro­pos­als while the main fans’ group, the Football Sup­port­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion, por­trayed the help for the lower leagues as a “sugar-coated cyanide pill of­fered up by bil­lion­aire own­ers who do not un­der­stand or care about our football cul­ture”.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the EFL put sup­port­ive club chair­men in front of the me­dia and they ex­pressed their en­thu­si­asm for the plans, praised Parry’s lead­er­ship and urged the Premier League’s smaller clubs to think of the good of the game as a whole.</p>
    <p>The EFL clubs have no say in the Premier League’s run­ning, how­ever, and had no vote in Wed­nes­day’s meet­ing. Those who do wield the power to make change, the ma­jor­ity of small-to-medium clubs in the top flight, were pre­cisely those who stood to lose the most.</p>
    <p>It would be no sur­prise if John Henry and Joel Glazer, the Amer­i­can own­ers of Liver­pool and United re­spec­tively, now set out to woo the am­bi­tious mid­dle lay­ers of the Premier League who fancy they might one day be among the elite.</p>
    <p>The only al­ter­na­tive, other than giv­ing in, is the “nu­clear op­tion”, which Parry so no­tice­ably re­fused to com­ment on – the threat of a break­away and the de­struc­tion of the league it­self.</p>
