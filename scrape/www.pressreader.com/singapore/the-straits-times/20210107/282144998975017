    <p>In a bid to pay off his grow­ing gam­bling debts, a former DBS Bank wealth plan­ning man­ager cheated four peo­ple of more than $400,000.</p>
    <p>Mar­cus Loh Thim Mun, 31, was sen­tenced to 33 months’ jail yes­ter­day. He had ear­lier pleaded guilty to five charges, in­clud­ing three of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that some time around Oc­to­ber 2018, Loh de­cided to ob­tain funds from his clients to set­tle his gam­bling debts.</p>
    <p>He told two of his vic­tims that they could place a fixed de­posit with DBS, earn­ing a higher in­ter­est than they typ­i­cally would from sav­ings ac­counts.</p>
    <p>He met one of them, a 56-year-old woman, on Oct 24, 2018, and asked her to log in to her bank ac­count us­ing his DBS-is­sued iPad.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim then left it to Loh to place a fixed de­posit for her. But he trans­ferred $50,000 from her bank ac­count to his own ac­count in­stead.</p>
    <p>On Oct 31, 2018, Loh met the other vic­tim, a 60-year-old woman. He asked her to log in to her bank ac­count us­ing his iPad and gave her de­tailed in­struc­tions, which re­sulted in the woman trans­fer­ring $250,000 to his bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>Loh lied to a third vic­tim, a 50-year-old man, about a sup­posed DBS share own­er­ship scheme which was ex­clu­sive to the bank’s em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Say­ing he wanted to help the vic­tim par­tic­i­pate in the scheme, Loh told the man to trans­fer money to his bank ac­count first. He said DBS would is­sue a let­ter guar­an­tee­ing the money used.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim later trans­ferred $20,000 to him. Loh gave the man a let­ter al­legedly from DBS which he had forged us­ing the bank’s let­ter­head and stamp.</p>
    <p>Loh met the last vic­tim, a 34-year-old woman, at a DBS branch on Nov 13, 2018. Pre­tend­ing to as­sist the woman in plac­ing a fixed de­posit of $100,000 with the bank, Loh in­stead trans­ferred the sum to his per­sonal ac­count. As the vic­tim could not view the de­tails of her sup­posed fixed de­posit, she asked Loh about the trans­ac­tion. Loh replied that there was a sys­tem de­lay, and the woman left the DBS branch.</p>
    <p>He later trans­ferred $50,000 back to her for un­known rea­sons, court doc­u­ments state.</p>
    <p>On Nov 15, 2018, the woman asked Loh again why she could not view the de­tails of her fixed de­posit.</p>
    <p>She then sought clarificat­ion at an­other DBS branch and was in­formed that DBS did not have any records of the fixed de­posit be­ing placed. A po­lice re­port was lodged the next day.</p>
    <p>Loh has since made full resti­tu­tion to DBS, which had com­pen­sated all his vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court granted Loh’s re­quest to de­fer his sen­tence to Jan 18 so that he can set­tle some per­sonal mat­ters.</p>
