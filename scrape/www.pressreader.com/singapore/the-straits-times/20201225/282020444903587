    <p>The let­ter by Fo­rum con­trib­u­tor Eve­line Tu res­onated strongly with my ex­pe­ri­ence of buy­ing a strata-ti­tled prop­erty (Im­por­tant to main­tain qual­ity con­trol in con­struc­tion sec­tor, Dec 21).</p>
    <p>The prop­erty I pur­chased, lo­cated in the east, re­ceived its tem­po­rary oc­cu­pa­tion per­mit (TOP) around late 2015.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­oper and main con­trac­tor are rel­a­tively es­tab­lished lo­cal com­pa­nies. For some of their projects, both com­pa­nies have also won ac­co­lades from the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA) for build qual­ity and de­sign in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ex­pe­ri­ence on the ground was very dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty that I pur­chased achieved a BCA Con­quas (Con­struc­tion Qual­ity As­sess­ment Sys­tem) score of more than or equal to 95, plac­ing it in the 87th per­centile rank­ing for con­struc­tion qual­ity that year.</p>
    <p>This would sug­gest very good build qual­ity. Yet, for such a young es­tate, it has had to con­tend with roof leaks on the build­ing’s top floor and at the base­ment carpark, elec­tri­cal wiring prob­lems re­quir­ing com­pre­hen­sive re­arrange­ment and re­pair, and struc­tural de­fect is­sues, among other prob­lems.</p>
    <p>In the last 12 months, PUB and the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence</p>
    <p>Force have found that the es­tate’s de­sign and build do not com­ply with some re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are prob­lems that orig­i­nated right from the time the project was com­pleted.</p>
    <p>In such sit­u­a­tions, how could the prop­erty be cer­ti­fied and ap­proved by the same au­thor­i­ties to re­ceive TOP and the sub­se­quent Cer­tifi­cate of Statu­tory Com­ple­tion (CSC)?</p>
    <p>Is­su­ing TOP and CSC to the es­tate trans­fers the prob­lem to new own­ers, who did not have prior knowl­edge of such is­sues.</p>
    <p>How can buy­ers be ex­pected to do such qual­i­fied checks?</p>
    <p>Even if the de­vel­oper or con­trac­tor of­fers to rem­edy the sit­u­a­tion, the so­lu­tion is likely to be a tem­po­rary fix, with un­known fu­ture li­a­bil­ity once the re­pairs start to fail.</p>
    <p>New own­ers would likely have to spend money or use es­tate funds to seek re­dress through lawyers and other spe­cial­ist con­sul­tants.</p>
    <p>Does this in­di­cate that there might be un­der­ly­ing is­sues in our res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ments and con­struc­tion reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment?</p>
    <p>A thor­ough re­view needs to be con­ducted to en­sure that devel­op­ers and builders do not slack, push­ing for max­i­mum profit at the ex­pense of un­know­ing buy­ers.</p>
