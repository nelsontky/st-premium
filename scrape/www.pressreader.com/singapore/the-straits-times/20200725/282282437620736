    <p>• State un­em­ploy­ment claims in­creased last week for the first time in nearly four months, dis­turb­ing ev­i­dence that the strug­gling US econ­omy is back­slid­ing at a time when coro­n­avirus cases are on the rise.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a flood of claims as the pan­demic forced busi­nesses to close ear­lier this year, weekly un­em­ploy­ment fil­ings fell sharply be­fore flat­ten­ing last month. But on Thurs­day, the Labour Depart­ment re­ported more than 1.4 mil­lion new ap­pli­ca­tions for state ben­e­fits last week, up from about 1.3 mil­lion in the pre­ced­ing two weeks.</p>
    <p>An­other 975,000 job­less work­ers filed for ben­e­fits through an emer­gency fed­eral pro­gramme, also an in­crease. Un­like the fig­ure for state claims, that num­ber is not sea­son­ally ad­justed.</p>
    <p>Claims are ris­ing just as a US$600-a-week (S$830-a-week) fed­eral sup­ple­ment to job­less ben­e­fits is set to ex­pire and Repub­li­can in­fight­ing has kept the party from putting for­ward a pro­posal for fur­ther aid, much less ne­go­ti­at­ing with Democrats on a Bill.</p>
    <p>The news from the Labour Depart­ment fol­lowed a Cen­sus Bureau sur­vey show­ing that four mil­lion fewer peo­ple were em­ployed last week than the week be­fore. It was the fourth straight de­cline, sug­gest­ing that nearly all the job gains since mid-May have been erased.</p>
    <p>“At this stage, you’re see­ing all the wrong el­e­ments for re­cov­ery,” said Mr Gre­gory Daco, the chief US econ­o­mist at Ox­ford Eco­nom­ics. “A de­te­ri­o­rat­ing health sit­u­a­tion, a weak­en­ing labour mar­ket and a soft­en­ing path for de­mand.”</p>
    <p>He said the rush to re­open in many states had been coun­ter­pro­duc­tive, con­tribut­ing to the in­creas­ing virus caseloads, par­tic­u­larly in the south and west, that are com­pelling busi­nesses to close again.</p>
    <p>“In­creas­ingly I fear that we’re go­ing to see net pay­rolls in July show an ac­tual de­cline” when the next job re­port is re­leased, he added.</p>
    <p>About 30 mil­lion peo­ple – roughly one in five Amer­i­can work­ers – are draw­ing job­less ben­e­fits. With­out con­gres­sional ac­tion to ex­tend the weekly fed­eral sup­ple­ment, the un­em­ployed will be left with less money to pay for daily ex­penses. Also near­ing an end is the fed­eral pay cheque pro­tec­tion pro­gramme, which pro­vided small busi­nesses with emer­gency loans that spared many work­ers from lay­offs.</p>
    <p>The stub­bornly high rate of new job­less claims “sug­gests that the na­ture of the down­turn has changed from early on”, said pol­icy econ­o­mist Ernie Tedeschi at eq­uity re­search firm Ever­core ISI. In ad­di­tion to re­flect­ing re­newed shut­downs, the set­backs may in­di­cate some­thing more fun­da­men­tal.</p>
    <p>“It might be that busi­nesses are run­ning through their first line of credit, and now they’re fac­ing the mu­sic of an econ­omy that has re­cov­ered a lit­tle bit but not nearly enough,” he said.</p>
