    <p>SEOUL • South Korea yes­ter­day ac­cused Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping of dis­tort­ing his­tory in a speech he made on the Korean War, of­fer­ing rare crit­i­cism of its big­gest trad­ing part­ner over rhetoric seen as an­tiAmer­i­can.</p>
    <p>South Korean For­eign Min­is­ter Kang Kyung-wha dis­missed as in­ac­cu­rate claims that China fought against “im­pe­ri­al­ist in­vaders” dur­ing the 1950-1953 Korean War.</p>
    <p>“The in­ter­na­tional de­bate on this has al­ready been ter­mi­nated,” Ms Kang said in tes­ti­mony to Par­lia­ment, adding that the war was started by North Korea, an ally of the Soviet Union and China, when it in­vaded South Korea.</p>
    <p>“The fact is clearly stated and recog­nised by the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil,” Ms Kang said. “We are tak­ing nec­es­sary com­mu­ni­ca­tion mea­sures with the Chi­nese re­gard­ing this mat­ter,” she added, with­out giv­ing de­tails.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers called on South Korea to sum­mon China’s am­bas­sador in Seoul for talks over Mr Xi’s com­ments made last week.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese Pres­i­dent had sent a mes­sage to the United States when he spoke last Fri­day at cer­e­monies mark­ing the 70th an­niver­sary of China’s en­try into the war to fight on be­half of North Korea, say­ing his coun­try is not in­tim­i­dated by Amer­i­can mil­i­tary might.</p>
    <p>The Korean War re­mains the only time China has gone to war with the US, which was com­mand­ing United Na­tions forces in the 1950-1953 con­flict.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter stren­u­ous bat­tles, the Chi­nese and (North Korean) armed forces de­feated an op­po­nent that was armed to the teeth, and broke the myth that the US mil­i­tary is in­vin­ci­ble,” the Com­mu­nist Par­ty­backed Global Times quoted Mr Xi as say­ing.</p>
    <p>South Korean De­fence Min­is­ter Suh Wook also said that he dis­agrees with Mr Xi.</p>
    <p>“It is crys­tal clear that North Korea in­vaded the South, un­der the in­sti­ga­tion of Stalin and Mao Ze­dong,” Mr Suh told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, re­fer­ring to the lead­ers of the Soviet Union and China at the time of the war.</p>
    <p>Sen­si­tiv­i­ties around the war are run­ning high in China, where ear­lier this month mil­lions of peo­ple took to so­cial me­dia to crit­i­cise South Korean K-pop mu­sic group BTS mem­ber Kim Nam-joon, known by his stage name RM, for ne­glect­ing to talk about China’s role when he men­tioned the Korean War at an awards cer­e­mony in New York.</p>
