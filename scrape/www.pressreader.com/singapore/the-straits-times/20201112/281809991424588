    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son was among the first Euro­pean lead­ers to con­grat­u­late United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den on his elec­tion vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“The US is our im­por­tant ally and I look for­ward to work­ing closely to­gether on our shared pri­or­i­ties, from cli­mate change to trade and se­cu­rity,” he said.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate mes­sage, For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab added: “The UK-US friend­ship has al­ways been a force for good in the world.”</p>
    <p>But the ex­pec­ta­tion in both Lon­don and other Euro­pean cap­i­tals is that Bri­tain will have to work hard to re-es­tab­lish the sort of spe­cial re­la­tion­ship it has tra­di­tion­ally en­joyed with the US.</p>
    <p>For Mr Bi­den has pub­licly spo­ken against some of the key pol­icy pri­or­i­ties of the John­son gov­ern­ment. And Mr John­son and Mr Bi­den are hardly nat­u­ral al­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s big­gest prob­lem is that he is per­ceived by many of those likely to be in­flu­en­tial mem­bers in the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion as just a Bri­tish ver­sion of cur­rent US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>There are cer­tain sim­i­lar­i­ties. Like Mr Trump, the Bri­tish leader rose to fame be­cause of me­dia stunts.</p>
    <p>Both be­long to the right of the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum, but nei­ther can be clas­si­fied as main­stream politi­cians. They have also faced scan­dals in their pri­vate lives, in­volv­ing a mul­ti­tude of fe­male part­ners.</p>
    <p>And, like Mr Trump, Mr John­son has a record of us­ing colour­ful lan­guage against his op­po­nents, in­clud­ing a se­ries of dis­parag­ing re­marks about then US Pres­i­dent Barack Obama, un­der whom Mr Bi­den served as vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>But be­yond th­ese su­per­fi­cial sim­i­lar­i­ties, there is a world of dif­fer­ence be­tween the Bri­tish Premier and the cur­rent US Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son works within a Bri­tish par­lia­men­tary sys­tem which re­stricts his pow­ers to an ex­tent un­known to Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, although Mr John­son has tried to be friendly with Pres­i­dent Trump, the two have never been chummy. The Bri­tish leader fun­da­men­tally dis­agrees with Mr Trump’s ap­proach to­wards Rus­sia, as well as his re­fusal to ac­knowl­edge the sci­ence be­hind cli­mate change and the need to pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>And, while both the Amer­i­can and Bri­tish lead­ers view China as a strate­gic threat, they dis­agree on what needs to be done. For in­stance, Mr John­son had to be pushed hard by Washington be­fore agree­ing to restrict the abil­ity of Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions gi­ant Huawei to op­er­ate in Bri­tish mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Still, per­cep­tions mat­ter, and the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment will have to work hard to dis­pel the pre­vail­ing view in the US me­dia that Lon­don is less than happy about Mr Bi­den’s elec­toral vic­tory.</p>
    <p>And the snag for Prime Min­is­ter John­son is that his key pol­icy ob­jec­tive, which is to sep­a­rate</p>
    <p>Bri­tain from the Euro­pean Union, is re­garded by the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion as a big strate­gic er­ror.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who is very proud of his Ir­ish an­ces­try, is also dead set against the cre­ation of a hard bor­der be­tween North­ern Ire­land, which re­mains part of the United King­dom, and the rest of the is­land of Ire­land, which re­mains in the EU.</p>
    <p>The in­com­ing US Pres­i­dent has been ex­plicit in his threat that, un­less that ques­tion is re­solved to the sat­is­fac­tion of the Ir­ish – who want no such bor­der – Bri­tain will not be able to get a free trade deal with the US.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, how­ever, of­fi­cials in Lon­don have known for some time that even if the new oc­cu­pant of the White House is pre­pared to over­look the ques­tion of Ire­land, the US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, where the eth­nic Ir­ish lobby counts for a great deal, will not rat­ify any trade deal with Bri­tain un­til the mat­ter is re­solved. So, a Bri­tish con­ces­sion on this is in­evitable.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, a trade deal with Bri­tain is hardly Mr Bi­den’s pri­or­ity, so the Bri­tish will have to wait for a bit longer re­gard­less of what they do.</p>
    <p>The real prob­lem for Mr John­son is how to pre­vent his coun­try from be­ing over­shad­owed by US at­ten­tion to other Euro­pean na­tions. For the US Pres­i­dent-elect may re­vive the prac­tice of Mr Obama, his Demo­crat pre­de­ces­sor, who treated Ger­many rather than Bri­tain as Amer­ica’s key Euro­pean ally.</p>
    <p>Still, the Bri­tish have one en­dur­ing as­set. Through a web of treaties ty­ing to­gether Bri­tish and Amer­i­can in­tel­li­gence ser­vices, the mil­i­tary and de­fence man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pa­nies for many decades, the Bri­tish have un­prece­dented ac­cess to all the lev­els of the US po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic ma­chin­ery, which they are now de­ter­mined to ex­ploit to the full.</p>
    <p>So, although the public ex­changes be­tween Mr John­son and Mr Bi­den have been cool, be­hind the scenes, a mas­sive Bri­tish en­gage­ment ef­fort is now un­fold­ing.</p>
