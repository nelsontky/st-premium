    <p>I have ob­served an in­creas­ing de­sire in the com­mu­nity to fur­ther re­lax re­stric­tions re­lated to Covid-19. This per­plexes me.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore dur­ing this time al­lows its res­i­dents so much free­dom to do things com­pared with many other coun­tries. I should know – I re­cently re­turned from the United States.</p>
    <p>Life for me there was not a life. While there are fewer of­fi­cial re­stric­tions there, the prac­ti­cal con­straints for those of us con­cerned about in­fec­tion are much greater. I re­mained in­side the flat where I lived for vir­tu­ally six months. I would exit once a week (be­fore dawn, so that I would not en­counter peo­ple) to col­lect the mail, but oth­er­wise was com­pletely se­questered in­side.</p>
    <p>All gro­ceries and medicine were de­liv­ered. No rel­a­tives or friends vis­ited. Med­i­cal ap­point­ments were con­ducted via video call. Ex­er­cise was done in the bed­room.</p>
    <p>I did not feel safe go­ing out­side sim­ply be­cause ba­sic safe­guards were not in place – over 50 per cent of the peo­ple I en­coun­tered did not wear masks, de­spite a manda­tory mask man­date.</p>
    <p>Con­trast this to what I have seen since re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore. Chil­dren are go­ing to school, peo­ple are go­ing to restau­rants and the gym, friends are see­ing friends, and pub­lic trans­porta­tion is freely used.</p>
    <p>This is a com­pletely dif­fer­ent world and ac­ces­si­ble to us only be­cause of the frame­work the Gov­ern­ment has in place to limit and trace Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>I wel­come these pre­cau­tions since they are al­low­ing me to live a proper life and guard against a po­ten­tial in­crease in cases. Who would want any­thing dif­fer­ent?</p>
