    <p>•</p>
    <p>BARCELONA Lionel Messi be­came the first player to score in 16 con­sec­u­tive Cham­pi­ons League sea­sons, but Barcelona coach Ron­ald Koe­man was left ru­ing a mo­ment of rash­ness that could cost his side top spot in Group G.</p>
    <p>With min­nows Ferenc­varos and Dy­namo Kiev in the draw, the Cata­lan giants and Ju­ven­tus are firmly ex­pected to duke it out to emerge as group win­ners.</p>
    <p>Barca will travel to Italy to take on the Serie A cham­pi­ons next week, but they will be with­out Ger­ard Pique af­ter the for­mer Spain de­fender was sent off for bla­tant pull­back in the box 20 min­utes from time in the match against Ferenc­varos on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>His red card did not cost Koe­man’s men, who were al­ready lead­ing 3-0, and while the Hun­gar­ian side got one back from the spot, the hosts added another two af­ter­wards for a 5-1 thump­ing.</p>
    <p>Still, Pique’s ab­sence for the cru­cial trip to Turin may prove to be de­ci­sive in who fin­ishes the group on top and there­fore, likely to have an eas­ier op­po­nent in the last 16.</p>
    <p>Koe­man was un­happy, claim­ing that the penalty was suf­fi­cient and a yel­low card would have been a more suitable pun­ish­ment in­stead.</p>
    <p>“The penalty and the red card is very bad for us but we are getting used to play­ing with one less,” the Dutch­man told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“It hap­pened at Celta Vigo (on Oct 1) and again to­day. It’s too harsh a pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>“If it’s foul, it’s a penalty and a yel­low card. I don’t un­der­stand why the ref­eree pro­duced the red card. But we have to ac­cept it.”</p>
    <p>Since 2015 – their fifth and last Euro­pean Cup – Barca have not ad­vanced to the fi­nal, prompt­ing Messi’s aborted re­quest to leave the Nou Camp this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Their sea­son will not be judged by per­for­mances against Ferenc­varos, but rather against the likes of Juve.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a com­mand­ing dis­play should at least give some con­fi­dence to a team who have had a mixed start in La Liga and host Real in the first Cla­sico of the cam­paign on Satur­day. Af­ter four league games, Barca are on seven points from two wins and a draw.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Messi, Ansu Fati, Philippe Coutinho, and sub­sti­tutes Pedri and Ous­mane Dem­bele were all on tar­get, leav­ing Koe­man pleased.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, I’m happy. At times we played very good foot­ball, but some­times we also slowed down too much,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That’s best for a coach. If there were any doubts about Barca’s goalscor­ers, we have shown tonight that we have good peo­ple, with the great Leo who has given two as­sists. We’re go­ing home happy.”</p>
    <p>Juve also made a win­ning start, with a dou­ble from for­mer Real striker Al­varo Mo­rata, who is on a sea­son-long loan from Atletico Madrid, sink­ing Dy­namo 2-0 away.</p>
    <p>De­spite Cris­tiano Ron­aldo’s ab­sence due to a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test last week, An­drea Pirlo en­joyed his first win as a coach in Europe’s elite club com­pe­ti­tion, which he won twice with AC Mi­lan dur­ing his play­ing days.</p>
    <p>The vic­tory came against Kiev coach Mircea Lucescu, who 25 years ago handed the 41-year-old his pro­fes­sional de­but for Bres­cia.</p>
    <p>In Group F, Ciro Im­mo­bile scored early against his for­mer club Borus­sia Dort­mund as Lazio marked their re­turn to the Cham­pi­ons League af­ter a 13-year ab­sence with a 3-1 up­set win.</p>
    <p>The reign­ing Euro­pean Golden Shoe win­ner later re­minded his crit­ics that he was la­belled “Dort­mund’s worst sign­ing” af­ter a poor 2014-15 sea­son be­fore be­ing moved on, but has since be­come a key player for club and the Az­zurri.</p>
    <p>BRIGHT SPOTS</p>
    <p>That’s best for a coach. If there were any doubts about Barca’s goalscor­ers, we have shown tonight that we have good peo­ple, with the great Leo who has given two as­sists. We’re go­ing home happy.</p>
    <p>RON­ALD KOE­MAN, Barcelona coach, af­ter see­ing his team put five past Ferenc­varos in their Cham­pi­ons League open­ing match.</p>
