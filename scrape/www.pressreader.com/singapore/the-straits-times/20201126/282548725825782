    <p>A cos­mopo­lite, an in­vet­er­ate cor­re­spon­dent and a ded­i­cated artist.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gette Chen: At Home In The World cap­tures all these as­pects of the pi­o­neer­ing artist, the sole fe­male in the school of Nanyang painters who formed Sin­ga­pore’s first gen­er­a­tion of artists.</p>
    <p>The show, which opens at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore to­mor­row, took cu­ra­tors Lim Shu­juan, Sam Ishan, Teo Hui Min and Cai Heng about three years to as­sem­ble. They trav­elled to China and Malaysia to re­search and ar­range loans.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is an ex­hi­bi­tion, spread over two gal­leries, which in­cludes 69 paint­ings and 74 pieces of archival ma­te­rial. This collection of arte­facts delves into Chen’s early life and of­fers vis­i­tors the op­por­tu­nity to see rarely seen works.</p>
    <p>There are 16 pieces on loan from other in­sti­tu­tions and col­lec­tors. Some pieces from the Na­tional Collection have not been dis­played since the last Chen ex­hi­bi­tion at the Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum in 1997.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple of the lat­ter is Hakka Fam­ily, a 1939 work much beloved by Chen her­self but less well-known to au­di­ences than Fam­ily Por­trait (1954-1955).</p>
    <p>Ms Teo, 30, notes that Chen was so proud of Hakka Fam­ily that she ex­hib­ited it in many shows and it was al­ways the No. 1 piece listed in ex­hi­bi­tion cat­a­logues. “It demon­strates the theme of mother and child that she re­turns to many times. She wanted to rep­re­sent peo­ple’s lives and this re­flected her ded­i­ca­tion to doc­u­ment­ing re­al­i­ties of peo­ple’s lives.”</p>
    <p>The work was first shown at the Metropole Ho­tel in 1943. Sub­se­quently, it was part of Chen’s shows at the Asian So­ci­ety in New York in 1949 and in Paris in 1950.</p>
    <p>“Within a short span of years, Ge­or­gette dis­played a large range of works in the world,” Ms Teo adds.</p>
    <p>This globe-trot­ting was a mo­tif of Chen’s life. Born to a wealthy busi­ness­man who started an arts and an­tiques busi­ness in New York, Chen grew up in China but trav­elled fre­quently to Paris and New York, where she stud­ied art.</p>
    <p>Her peri­patetic life­style con­tin­ued af­ter she mar­ried diplo­mat Eu­gene Chen in 1930, and af­ter he died in 1944.</p>
    <p>The var­ied set­tings for her paint­ings re­flected her en­gage­ment with the world around her, from the for­mal aca­demic nudes she drew for her Parisian art stud­ies and postIm­pres­sion­ist style land­scapes of France, to the ele­gantly in­tro­spec­tive land­scapes of China and bright colours of trop­i­cal South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>This en­gage­ment is high­lighted in the name of the ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, 37, ob­serves: “No mat­ter where Ge­or­gette is in the world, what pushes her for­ward is her un­wa­ver­ing ded­i­ca­tion to her art. As long as she has her paint­brush, she is at home in the world.”</p>
    <p>While Chen spent the long­est stretch of her life – some 40 years – in Sin­ga­pore, this is­land was not her first land­ing in South-east Asia. She had orig­i­nally set up home in Pe­nang in 1951.</p>
    <p>But a di­vorce from her sec­ond hus­band Ho Yung Chi and a job of­fer from Lim Hak Tai, founder and prin­ci­pal of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa), prompted a move south.</p>
    <p>Archival ma­te­ri­als, such as news­pa­per ar­ti­cles to per­sonal let­ters, are vivid glimpses into Chen’s event­ful life, high­light­ing her front-row seat</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gette Chen’s (above) in­ter­est in the lives of every­day peo­ple was ev­i­dent in her works, such as in Malay Wed­ding (above left). The ret­ro­spec­tive in­cludes archival ma­te­rial such as pho­tos. (right). to po­lit­i­cal and so­cial up­heavals of the 20th cen­tury, from the over­turn­ing of the Chi­nese monar­chy to the rav­ages of World War II.</p>
    <p>As a golden girl from a wealthy fam­ily, her stud­ies and trav­els were re­ported in news­pa­pers, as clip­pings show. She moved in a con­nected cir­cle of ac­quain­tances, as can be seen in her cor­re­spon­dence with Soong Ching-ling, wife of Chi­nese politi­cian Sun Yat Sen.</p>
    <p>Well-ed­u­cated and flu­ent in Man­darin, English, French and Malay, Chen moved eas­ily be­tween coun­tries and cul­tures. She took her art very se­ri­ously, ex­press­ing her in­ten­tion to make a liv­ing from paint­ing in her let­ters to friends and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of por­traits in the ex­hi­bi­tion is a re­flec­tion of this.</p>
    <p>As Ms Lim ex­plains: “Por­traits were a way to earn a liv­ing and to de­pict friends and the mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The Im­pres­sion­ist in­flu­ence on Chen emerges in the way she ded­i­cated her­self to the prac­tice of paint­ing en plein air (in the out­doors). Stud­ies of her paint­ings showed that she ap­plied thin lay­ers of paint, work­ing quickly to achieve her ef­fects. She was pro­lific, pro­duc­ing be­tween 200 and 300 paint­ings in her life­time.</p>
    <p>There is an archival photograph of</p>
    <p>Chen paint­ing lo­tus flow­ers mounted on the wall next to two of her famed lo­tus paint­ings.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo says Chen spent an en­tire hol­i­day work­ing on this se­ries: “She painted from 10am to 7pm. Ev­ery day was ded­i­cated to paint­ing the lo­tus flower.”</p>
    <p>While she was se­ri­ous about her art, Chen also had a puck­ish sense of hu­mour. Re­fer­ring to her mul­ti­ple still-life paint­ings of trop­i­cal fruit, she jested that she was a “rambu­tan spe­cial­ist”.</p>
    <p>While she had hoped to re­turn to China in the post-war pe­riod to live and work as an artist, life brought her in­stead to Sin­ga­pore, where she prac­tised her craft while nur­tur­ing new gen­er­a­tions of artists at Nafa.</p>
    <p>A quote in the show re­veals how her art helped her set­tle into var­i­ous new mi­lieus with seem­ing ease: “I love to por­tray the dif­fer­ent scenes, flora and peo­ple of my moth­er­land in my paint­ings.</p>
    <p>“Of par­tic­u­lar in­ter­est to me are the lives of every­day peo­ple. Rep­re­sen­ta­tion based on imag­i­na­tion can never truly re­flect the real thing. Peo­ple’s lives are vi­va­cious, fresh and spir­ited.”</p>
    <p>Art, it seems, is the truest lens for real life for this pi­o­neer.</p>
