    <p>Bi­cy­cles with­out a func­tion­ing hand­brake should be banned from foot­paths and roads, the Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Ad­vi­sory Panel said yes­ter­day. If ac­cepted, this pro­posed rule will af­fect fixed-gear bi­cy­cles, which gen­er­ally do not have hand-op­er­ated brakes but in­stead rely on the rider’s pedal re­sis­tance to stop.</p>
    <p>NOT FOR NOVICE CY­CLISTS Those rac­ing us­ing fixed-gear bi­cy­cles know that it’s not the case that any­one can hop onto it and ride it like a nor­mal bike... It takes some skill to ride it... so they are ac­tu­ally sup­port­ive es­pe­cially when chil­dren as young as 11 years old are start­ing to ride this kind of bi­cy­cle. MR STEVEN LIM, pres­i­dent of the Safe Cy­cling Task Force and a mem­ber of the Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Ad­vi­sory Panel, on how the authoritie­s and the panel had spo­ken with fixed-gear cy­clists about the pro­posed rules ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Bi­cy­cles with­out a func­tion­ing hand­brake should be banned from foot­paths and roads, the Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Ad­vi­sory Panel (AMAP) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>If ac­cepted, this pro­posed rule will af­fect fixed-gear bi­cy­cles, which gen­er­ally do not have han­d­op­er­ated brakes, but in­stead rely on the rider’s pedal re­sis­tance to stop.</p>
    <p>It will also af­fect bi­cy­cle mo­tocross (BMX) bi­cy­cles, which are off-road sport bi­cy­cles used for rac­ing and stunt rid­ing.</p>
    <p>The panel sub­mit­ted its rec­om­men­da­tion on the is­sue to the Min­istry of Trans­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In its re­port, AMAP said: “After con­sult­ing tech­ni­cal ex­perts, study­ing other ju­ris­dic­tions’ ex­pe­ri­ence, and en­gag­ing var­i­ous stake­hold­ers, the panel rec­om­mends that there should be a min­i­mum brake re­quire­ment for all bi­cy­cles used on public paths and roads.”</p>
    <p>It said this would im­prove safety for both rid­ers and path users.</p>
    <p>The panel said fixed-gear bi­cy­cles, known as fix­ies, are mainly used for recre­ational cy­cling or for track cy­cling. It said in­ex­pe­ri­enced cy­clists may find it chal­leng­ing to stop the bi­cy­cles ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>Such bi­cy­cles came un­der public scru­tiny in Jan­uary when a 13-year-old novice cy­clist fell to her death after she hit a rail­ing while rid­ing her friend’s fixed-gear bi­cy­cle down a ramp in a mul­ti­storey carpark in Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>AMAP noted that the ac­ci­dent hap­pened be­cause the girl was un­able to stop the bi­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>It said: “Although these bi­cy­cles could have hand­brakes in­stalled, own­ers tended not to do so, as it would be per­ceived as cooler, and had lower main­te­nance costs.”</p>
    <p>With the pro­posed new rule, all users of fixed-gear bi­cy­cles must in­stall at least one hand­brake to use the de­vices on paths and roads.</p>
    <p>On BMX bi­cy­cles, the panel said it found that they were typ­i­cally used in con­trolled en­vi­ron­ments such as cy­cling parks and were gen­er­ally not used for com­mutes.</p>
    <p>Cy­clists who use them within such con­trolled en­vi­ron­ments will be able to con­tinue do­ing so. But they will have to in­stall at least one brake if they want to use the bi­cy­cle on paths and roads.</p>
    <p>AMAP added: “The panel will also work closely with the Govern­ment to mon­i­tor whether the cur­rent prac­tice of con­ven­tional bi­cy­cles be­ing equipped with two hand­brakes would change with the new reg­u­la­tion, and take fur­ther ac­tion if needed.”</p>
    <p>Mr Steven Lim, pres­i­dent of the Safe Cy­cling Task Force and a mem­ber of AMAP, told The Straits Times that the authoritie­s and the panel had spo­ken with fixed-gear cy­clists about the pro­posed rules ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“Those rac­ing us­ing fixed-gear bi­cy­cles know that it’s not the case that any­one can hop onto it and ride it like a nor­mal bike,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It takes some skill to ride it... so they are ac­tu­ally sup­port­ive, es­pe­cially when chil­dren as young as 11 years old are start­ing to ride this kind of bi­cy­cle.”</p>
    <p>The panel also rec­om­mended in its re­port that reg­u­la­tions on third­party li­a­bil­ity in­sur­ance (TPLI) should not be im­posed on non­com­mer­cial users at this point.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent high cost of TPLI, es­pe­cially when com­pared with the cost of ac­tive mo­bil­ity de­vices, will de­ter many non-com­mer­cial users from tak­ing up ac­tive mo­bil­ity modes,” said AMAP.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim, who chairs the AMAP, said in a Face­book post that the panel will also mon­i­tor the ef­fec­tive­ness of the manda­tory TPLI for com­mer­cial ac­tive mo­bil­ity de­vice users.</p>
