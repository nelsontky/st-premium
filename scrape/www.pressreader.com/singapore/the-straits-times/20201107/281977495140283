    <p>SYD­NEY/BEI­JING • Aus­tralia said yes­ter­day it was closely mon­i­tor­ing ex­ports to China amid “deeply trou­bling” re­ports that Chi­nese buy­ers have been told not to pur­chase seven cat­e­gories of Aus­tralian goods rang­ing from coal to wine, fur­ther sour­ing diplo­matic ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian me­dia has re­ported that Chi­nese im­porters had been in­for­mally warned by cus­toms of­fi­cials that com­modi­ties, in­clud­ing cop­per ore, bar­ley, sugar, tim­ber and lob­ster, would face in­creased in­spec­tions from yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Trade Min­is­ter Simon Birm­ing­ham said Chi­nese of­fi­cials had pub­licly and pri­vately de­nied that any co­or­di­nated ef­fort was be­ing taken against Aus­tralia, and said he hoped Bei­jing “is true to its word”.</p>
    <p>“They deny any dis­crim­i­na­tory ac­tions that are be­ing taken. But that doesn’t seem to be what in­dus­try is see­ing and hear­ing at present,” he said on ra­dio sta­tion 5AA.</p>
    <p>A Chi­nese source briefed on the mat­ter said that trade in the goods was ef­fec­tively halted for now, and other prod­ucts such as beef could be af­fected in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“It was not an ab­so­lute or­der, but a sug­ges­tion,” the per­son said, de­clin­ing to be iden­ti­fied ow­ing to the sen­si­tiv­ity of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>China buys nearly a third of Aus­tralia’s ex­ports.</p>
    <p>A Bei­jing-based wine im­porter and dis­trib­u­tor told Reuters his cus­toms agent in Shang­hai was called to a meet­ing last week and warned that Aus­tralian wine would no longer be pro­cessed by cus­toms af­ter Nov 6.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween Aus­tralia and its largest trad­ing part­ner have be­come strained af­ter Bei­jing was an­gered by Aus­tralia’s call for an in­ter­na­tional in­quiry into the source of the coro­n­avirus and Aus­tralian po­lice raids con­nected to for­eign in­ter­fer­ence in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Asked to con­firm if China had im­posed re­stric­tions on Aus­tralian im­ports, For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told a brief­ing yes­ter­day that mea­sures taken by China, which he did not spec­ify, are “le­git­i­mate, rea­son­able and be­yond re­proach”.</p>
    <p>Some Chi­nese im­porters had al­ready shunned Aus­tralian prod­ucts, even with­out ex­plicit gov­ern­ment or­ders.</p>
    <p>Two beef im­porters told Reuters they had re­cently bought prod­ucts from South Amer­ica in­stead.</p>
    <p>“You don’t know what’s go­ing to hap­pen, and whether the car­goes will be able to come in when they ar­rive,” said a man­ager with a Bei­jing-based meat im­porter.</p>
    <p>“There is no ex­plicit or­der on beef yet, but you can try to un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion your­self.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian com­pa­nies stopped send­ing rock lob­ster to China this week af­ter new cus­toms in­spec­tions were im­posed on the live seafood, re­sult­ing in lob­sters dy­ing be­fore they could reach cus­tomers. China also halted some im­ports of tim­ber and banned bar­ley ship­ments from an Aus­tralian­based ex­porter.</p>
    <p>China ear­lier this year launched an anti-dump­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Aus­tralian wine, and im­posed dump­ing tar­iffs on Aus­tralian bar­ley.</p>
    <p>Mr Birm­ing­ham said the “range and ex­tent of con­cerns that in­dus­try are hear­ing is deeply trou­bling”.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s agri­cul­ture de­part­ment held a meet­ing on Thurs­day for 400 farm­ers and ex­porters to China, warn­ing of the re­cent de­lays and com­mer­cial losses, it said in a state­ment to Reuters. De­part­ment of­fi­cials told ex­porters to seek ad­vice from i mporters i n China on po­ten­tial dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>An ed­i­to­rial i n the state-run China Daily news­pa­per yes­ter­day said China’s in­ves­ti­ga­tions cov­ered only a small por­tion of im­ports from Aus­tralia, adding that Can­berra should “steer clear of Wash­ing­ton’s brinkman­ship with China be­fore it is too late”.</p>
    <p>“Choos­ing sides will be a de­ci­sion Aus­tralia will come to re­gret as its econ­omy will only suf­fer fur­ther pain,” it said, re­fer­ring to Aus­tralia’s United States al­liance.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia j oined the US, In­dia and Ja­pan for the three-way Malabar naval ex­er­cise on Thurs­day, the first time it has par­tic­i­pated in the ex­er­cise since 2007.</p>
    <p>THE RE­AL­ITY SEEMS DIF­FER­ENT</p>
    <p>(Chi­nese of­fi­cials) deny any dis­crim­i­na­tory ac­tions that are be­ing taken. But that doesn’t seem to be what in­dus­try is see­ing and hear­ing at present.</p>
