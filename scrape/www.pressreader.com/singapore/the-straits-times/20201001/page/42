9.6 points per game this term. They averaged 40.7 points per game in the restricted area in the bubble – more than any other team. Bam Adebayo will need to be a strong offensive threat, as he was against the Boston Celtics when he was the Heat’s top scorer in the East Finals with an average of 21.8 points per game, if they are to pull off an upset. But much of his focus will be on defending Anthony Davis, who is set to take him away from the paint. SCHEDULE The former Cavalier and Heat star is the only player to average over 25 points per game with three different teams in the play-offs heading into the NBA Finals. JIMMY BUTLER PPG RPG 6.7 APG 19.9 6.0 Stop LeBron PHOTOS: AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS In Jimmy Butler and Andre Iguodala, the Heat have two of the most equipped players to guard James. Butler, four-time NBA All-Defensive Team member, has locked down James before, albeit in the 2013 Eastern Conference semi-finals. More recently, Iguodala has met the forward in NBA Finals from 2015-18, coming out tops thrice as the Golden State Warriors’ primary James defender.

The massive underdogs can become the first fifth seeds to win the title. They were 110-1 outsiders to win the championsh­ip before the season tipped off. Fairy-tale ending
