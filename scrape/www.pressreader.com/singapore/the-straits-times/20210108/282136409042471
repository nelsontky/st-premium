    <p>Union mem­bers stressed by the pan­demic and job sit­u­a­tion can soon re­ceive psy­cho­log­i­cal help to deal with the chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) will be of­fer­ing one-to-one coun­selling ser­vices to lower-in­come union mem­bers as well as those whose in­comes have been sig­nif­i­cantly re­duced.</p>
    <p>“Ex­pe­ri­enc­ing sud­den or great dis­tress due to work-re­lated cir­cum­stances may take a tremen­dous toll on work­ers’ men­tal well­be­ing,” NTUC said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This is es­pe­cially so for those who have heavy per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, such as care­givers, as well as those who have young and/or el­derly de­pen­dants.”</p>
    <p>NTUC, which is part­ner­ing psy­cho­log­i­cal cen­tre Mind Cul­ture in the pro­gramme, said more de­tails will be made known in March.</p>
    <p>The coun­selling ser­vice is part of a se­ries of as­sis­tance pro­grammes sup­ported by the NTUC-U Care Fund, which was started in 2009 to help NTUC union mem­bers af­fected by the eco­nomic down­turn then.</p>
    <p>“Sim­i­larly, more than 10 years on, we are pledg­ing our ut­most com­mit­ment to help our mem­bers through the chal­lenges brought upon by Covid-19,” said NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Zainal Sa­pari.</p>
    <p>Close to 100 donors con­trib­uted to the fund last year, al­low­ing NTUC to com­mit $31.5 mil­lion to bet­ter the wel­fare of lower-in­come mem­bers and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The labour move­ment said it had dis­bursed more than $16 mil­lion to about 33,000 mem­bers as at Dec 18, to help mem­bers im­pacted by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This was done through the NTUC Care Fund (Covid-19), which was launched in March last year. It pro­vides up to $300 cash re­lief to mem­bers whose in­comes have been sig­nif­i­cantly af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Among them was Mr Wong Wai Hong, 48, an au­dio-vis­ual tech­ni­cian who was re­trenched by Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The mar­ried fa­ther of two was re­ferred to the Build­ing Con­struc­tion and Tim­ber In­dus­tries Em­ploy­ees’ Union, which helped him ap­ply for the re­lief. He re­ceived $600 in two pay­ments.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter I was re­trenched, I felt lost and wor­ried for my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“I’m grate­ful that I re­ceived the cash re­lief to cover my fam­ily’s ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties and chil­dren’s school ex­penses to tide us over this period,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>Other pro­grammes in­clude the U Care Ed­u­ca­tion Co-Fund­ing scheme, which has given bur­sary awards to 4,500 chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Around 300 low- to medium-in­come union mem­bers also re­ceived in­terim sup­port from the Cap­i­ta­Land-U Care Re­silience and En­able­ment Fund (CAP+Ure).</p>
    <p>It pro­vides $250 in FairPrice vouch­ers per child to help fam­i­lies with their chil­dren’s ba­sic nu­tri­tional and ed­u­ca­tional needs.</p>
    <p>NTUC said mem­bers can still ap­ply for CAP+Ure sup­port.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for the NTUC Care Fund (Covid-19) are also still open. The clos­ing date is Feb 28.</p>
