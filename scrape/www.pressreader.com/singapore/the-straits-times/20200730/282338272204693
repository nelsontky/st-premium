    <p>Muted trad­ing con­tin­ues among Sin­ga­pore’s blue chips, with the Straits Times In­dex (STI) down 9.52 points, or 0.37 per cent, to 2,573.45.</p>
    <p>Losers out­num­bered gain­ers 215 to 185, af­ter about 1.33 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $1.29 bil­lion changed hands.</p>
    <p>The big­gest losers on the in­dex were Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust and Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust, which re­spec­tively lost 3.98 per cent to $1.93, and 2.89 per cent to $1.68, af­ter their se­cond-quar­ter earn­ings last week showed that they were clearly un­der­go­ing strain as a re­sult of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The big­gest gainer was Ven­ture Cor­po­ra­tion, which rose 3.58 per cent to $17.94. It was among the four most de­fen­sive stocks in the first half of this year, said the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX), as tech­nol­ogy and health­care coun­ters like­wise pro­pelled global in­dices from Jan­uary to last month.</p>
    <p>Bol­stered by a con­sis­tent amount of net in­sti­tu­tional buy­ing, Ven­ture has also shown pos­i­tive mo­men­tum in its share price, and beat con­sen­sus es­ti­mates for the quar­ter ended in March, SGX said. It is due to re­lease its first-half re­sults on Aug 7 af­ter mar­ket hours.</p>
    <p>The most ac­tive counter of the day was Catal­ist-listed IPS Se­curex, which added 12.7 per cent to $0.124, rid­ing on the op­ti­mism of last week’s profit guid­ance, in which it had said that it ex­pects to re­port a net profit for the fi­nan­cial year ended June 30, a turn­around from an au­dited net loss for FY2019. This was thanks to an im­prove­ment in rev­enue due to the in­come recog­ni­tion of more projects com­pleted dur­ing the year, as well as con­tin­ued cost-con­trol mea­sures at the cor­po­rate level.</p>
    <p>The per­for­mance of re­gional mar­kets was mixed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex added 0.45 per cent, while China’s bench­mark Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex jumped 2.06 per cent and the Shen­zhen Com­pos­ite In­dex ral­lied 2.90 per cent.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s bench­mark Kospi climbed 0.27 per cent – their high­est close since late Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>But Ja­pan’s bench­mark Nikkei 225 slid 1.15 per cent as the yen rose. Malaysia’s KLCI added 0.09 per cent. An­a­lysts said mar­kets would strug­gle to build on the strong gains seen since their March bot­tom.</p>
    <p>“There’s enough stim­u­lus and sup­port in the mar­ket from a mon­e­tary pol­icy per­spec­tive, but also from fis­cal, and that keeps a nice floor un­der the mar­ket,” said Ms Amanda Agati at PNC Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices Group.</p>
    <p>“But we also think it’s go­ing to be very dif­fi­cult to make a lot of for­ward progress in this en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
