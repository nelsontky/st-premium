    <p>The Sun­day Times talks to Mr Rayner Loi, 26, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Lu­mitics, a lo­cal tech­nol­ogy start-up that de­vel­oped In­sight, a smart food waste tracker. The de­vice is used by ho­tels, air­lines and large com­mer­cial kitchens to trace how much and what type of food is thrown away so that they can take steps to re­duce waste.</p>
    <p>Q How did the idea of the In­sight tracker come about?</p>
    <p>A I was at a buf­fet line when I no­ticed the staff serv­ing up trays of freshly pre­pared food 20 min­utes be­fore it closed. I was puz­zled. Why were they pre­par­ing fresh food min­utes be­fore clos­ing? It hit me that the ho­tels and buf­fet restau­rants are prob­a­bly the ones con­tribut­ing quite a bit to Sin­ga­pore’s food waste prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Upon some re­search, I re­alised that there was a lot of work done in food waste re­cy­cling and food re­dis­tri­bu­tion to those in need, but al­most none in pre­vent­ing food waste from be­ing gen­er­ated in the first place, at least in the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>I saw an op­por­tu­nity and started Lu­mitics to help kitchens bet­ter man­age their food waste.</p>
    <p>The tracker took about a year or so to de­velop and was of­fi­cially launched last year. To date, we’ve raised about $1 mil­lion from En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, Te­masek Foun­da­tion, travel and hospi­tal­ity ven­ture cap­i­tal fund Ve­loc­ity Ven­tures, as well as a syn­di­cate of hospi­tal­ity in­dus­try veter­ans.</p>
    <p>Q Tell us more about how the In­sight tracker helps to re­duce waste.</p>
    <p>A Most kitchens to­day don’t mea­sure their food waste and this lack of vis­i­bil­ity of­ten pre­vents ex­ec­u­tive chefs from tak­ing any mean­ing­ful steps to re­duce it.</p>
    <p>Our In­sight food waste tracker uses a sen­sor that weighs what is thrown onto the de­vice’s tray. A cam­era also takes a photo and uses ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to iden­tify the food items, af­ter which the con­tents in the tray are emp­tied into the kitchen’s bin.</p>
    <p>The data col­lected acts as a feed­back loop to help chefs un­der­stand what and how much is be­ing thrown out at each lunch ser­vice. Over time, we can an­a­lyse the data to iden­tify food waste trends and give the chefs ac­tion­able in­sights to min­imise food waste.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age, our so­lu­tion has helped our clients re­duce up to 40 per cent of their food waste. We have about 20 clients, in­clud­ing ho­tels and air­lines.</p>
    <p>Q Where do you think the big­gest amount of food waste is gen­er­ated?</p>
    <p>A We of­ten talk about re­duc­ing food waste at the con­sumer level, but there are many more op­por­tu­ni­ties to re­duce food waste be­fore we even come to the con­sumer’s plate.</p>
    <p>We need to fo­cus on busi­nesses be­cause they are in a bet­ter po­si­tion to re­ally make an im­pact given their scale of op­er­a­tions. If they re­duce food waste by just 10 per cent to 20 per cent on an an­nual ba­sis, that is a re­duc­tion of thou­sands of tonnes of food waste.</p>
    <p>Q What’s next for Lu­mitics?</p>
    <p>A We be­lieve that in the post-Covid-19 world, sus­tain­abil­ity and tack­ling food waste will be all the more im­por­tant for brands, be­cause in the re­cov­ery phase, no ho­tel or air­line can af­ford to be waste­ful.</p>
    <p>Sus­tain­abil­ity re­port­ing is also be­com­ing a trend as brands and listed com­pa­nies are held to greater ac­count­abil­ity for their ac­tions. Ho­tels, air­lines and cruise lines now have to take sus­tain­abil­ity and food waste se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>We hope to in­tro­duce our so­lu­tion to more mar­kets in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion and tre­ble our im­pact next year.</p>
