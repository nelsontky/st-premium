    <p>If I had been work­ing in the of­fice in­stead of from home, I think I would have spent more time an­swer­ing col­leagues’ ques­tions about the Sam­sung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G than writ­ing about it.</p>
    <p>This is the suc­ces­sor to the Fold, Sam­sung’s first fold­able smart­phone, which was launched last year.</p>
    <p>Its over­all de­sign does not dif­fer much from the orig­i­nal. When folded, the Fold2 looks like a nor­mal smart­phone, with a side power but­ton dou­bling as a fin­ger­print sen­sor. When un­folded, it be­comes a tablet.</p>
    <p>The de­sign ad­dresses a peren­nial is­sue smart­phone mak­ers face: bal­anc­ing sin­gle-hand us­age with big­ger screens.</p>
    <p>The Fold2 has slight changes from the orig­i­nal. Its cover dis­play has in­creased to 6.2 inches from the Fold’s 4.6 inches, ad­dress­ing a ma­jor com­plaint of the orig­i­nal. You need not squint when look­ing at this screen. It also looks more like a nor­mal smart­phone, al­beit a long and thick one.</p>
    <p>It un­folds into a 7.6-inch tablet (up from the orig­i­nal’s 7.3-inch size) with a thin side pro­file and tiny bezels – achieved by get­ting rid of the orig­i­nal’s cam­era notch and re­plac­ing it with a 10-megapixel (MP) hole-punch cam­era.</p>
    <p>The main dis­play’s adap­tive re­fresh rate goes up to 120Hz, allowing for smooth vi­su­als whether you are brows­ing the Web or play­ing games.</p>
    <p>At the rear of the smart­phone is a triple-cam­era sys­tem: a 12MP ul­tra­w­ide-an­gle cam­era, a 12MP widean­gle cam­era and a 12MP tele­photo cam­era with 2x op­ti­cal zoom.</p>
    <p>The Fold2 comes in black and bronze (ver­sion tested).</p>
    <p>Both mod­els are gor­geous, though I love the glam­orous bronze fin­ish, which seems to change colour as the light hits it at dif­fer­ent an­gles. The back of the bronze model has a matt fin­ish that makes it less sus­cep­ti­ble to fin­ger­prints and smudges.</p>
    <p>The new smart­phone feels more well-made than the orig­i­nal, based on what I can re­mem­ber from my brief hands-on time with the Fold.</p>
    <p>The hinge mech­a­nism feels stur­dier and has more re­sis­tance. You can­not un­fold the Fold2 with one hand as you can with the orig­i­nal. You have to open it like a book.</p>
    <p>The crease in the middle of the main dis­play is still ev­i­dent, es­pe­cially when viewed from an an­gle. But this should not be an is­sue as you will be look­ing at the phone straight on most of the time. I do not no­tice the crease when read­ing news, brows­ing the In­ter­net or play­ing games.</p>
    <p>The main dis­play looks sharp and vi­brant. It is a shame that its re­fresh rate can­not be set at 120Hz all the time. You can set the dis­play only to the adap­tive mode – which au­to­mat­i­cally changes the re­fresh rate to as much as 120Hz, de­pend­ing on the con­tent dis­played – or the stan­dard 60Hz mode.</p>
    <p>The Fold2 uses Qual­comm’s flag­ship Snap­dragon 865+ pro­ces­sor, so it is no slouch in terms of per­for­mance. In the Geek­bench 5 bench­mark test, it scores 973 (sin­gle-core) and 2,858 (multi-core). In com­par­i­son, Sam­sung’s flag­ship Galaxy Note20 Ul­tra scores 909 (sin­glecore) and 2,526 (multi-core).</p>
    <p>In terms of pro­duc­tiv­ity on the go, the Fold2 may be un­par­al­leled with its abil­ity to trans­form into a tablet. You can open up to three apps at the same time in a splitscree­n lay­out in the main dis­play. Text and images can be dragged from one app to an­other, which is great if you are work­ing on pre­sen­ta­tion slides while com­mut­ing.</p>
    <p>You can also save up to three favourite or fre­quently used apps to the Edge Panel, so you can open all three in your pre­ferred split-screen ar­range­ment with a sim­ple tap.</p>
    <p>Most apps, such as Chrome and Gmail, will move seam­lessly from the cover dis­play to the main dis­play, while ex­pand­ing to fill up the lat­ter, when you un­fold the phone.</p>
    <p>But when I un­fold it while gam­ing, most games have to be restarted be­fore I can play them on the main dis­play. Only some games, such as As­phalt 9 Leg­ends and Poke­mon Go, let me keep play­ing be­tween dis­plays.</p>
    <p>A new fea­ture is the Flex mode, in which the main dis­play is folded to be­tween 70 and 90 de­grees. Some apps split into two screens, each with dif­fer­ent fea­tures.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the cam­era splits into a viewfinder in the top screen and a pre­view of pho­tos you have shot – along with var­i­ous shoot­ing op­tions – in the bottom screen.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life de­pends on du­ra­tion of us­age and which dis­play you are us­ing more. Dur­ing my test, in which I use the Fold2 mostly in tablet mode, I find that it lasts a whole day, with around 40 per cent bat­tery life left by the time I go to bed.</p>
    <p>In the video play­back test with the main dis­play in adap­tive mode, it clocks 14 hours and 5 min­utes – an hour longer than its pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>The Fold2 sup­ports the 5G (Sub-6GHz band­width) net­work, so it is fu­ture-proof. But it is not dust- or water-proof, so han­dle it with care. You are re­minded not to press the main dis­play with a sharp ob­ject like a fin­ger­nail, to en­sure no ob­jects are placed be­tween screens when you are fold­ing the main dis­play and to not re­move the pre­in­stalled screen pro­tec­tor film.</p>
    <p>Any­way, you will prob­a­bly take very good care of the Fold2 if you buy one, given its whop­ping price tag of $2,888. And you get only 256GB of in­ter­nal mem­ory and no ex­pand­able stor­age. For that price, one would ex­pect at least 512GB.</p>
    <p>Still, it is $200 cheaper than the orig­i­nal, though it still costs about as much as the lat­est 15-inch Razer Blade gam­ing lap­top.</p>
    <p>Of course, no one will bat an eye­lid when you pull a gam­ing lap­top out of your bag, but they will stare when you un­fold the fu­ture be­fore their eyes.</p>
    <p>With the Galaxy Z Fold2 5G, Sam­sung has shown how fold­able smart­phones can work in the real world.</p>
