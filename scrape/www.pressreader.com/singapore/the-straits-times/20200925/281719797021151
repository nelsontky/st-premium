    <p>The Jackie Chan ac­tion block­buster Vanguard, held back from re­lease at Chi­nese New Year ear­lier this year, will be among the films to ben­e­fit un­der the re­laxed seat­ing ca­pac­ity rules an­nounced on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The highly an­tic­i­pated movie opens next Wed­nes­day. Other films, such as the Chi­nese an­i­mated fea­ture Jiang Zi Ya: Leg­end Of Deifi­ca­tion (opens next Thurs­day) and the James Bond spy thriller No Time To Die (opens Nov 12), are among the ti­tles better able to avoid the “sold out” no­tice on popular days such as week­ends.</p>
    <p>From next Thurs­day, large cin­ema halls with more than 300 seats will be al­lowed to ad­mit up to 150 pa­trons in three zones of 50 pa­trons each. Smaller cin­ema halls will be al­lowed to fill up to 50 per cent of their orig­i­nal ca­pac­ity or main­tain the cur­rent limit of up to 50 pa­trons per hall, as long as safe man­age­ment mea­sures are main­tained.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas were pre­vi­ously al­lowed to open on July 13 with the 50-pa­tron limit and a 1m so­cial dis­tanc­ing seat­ing con­fig­u­ra­tion, af­ter hav­ing been closed since March 27.</p>
    <p>This lim­ited seat­ing to about 25 per cent of ca­pac­ity. In re­sponse, cin­ema op­er­a­tors have taken mea­sures such as launch­ing stream­ing por­tals, among them Cathay Cine­plexes’ Cathay CineHome, Shaw Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Ki­noLounge and in­die cin­ema The Pro­jec­tor’s Pro­jec­tor Plus.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the new mea­sures, a spokesman for Cathay Cine­plexes said: “We look for­ward to wel­com­ing more guests to our cin­e­mas in Oc­to­ber, es­pe­cially with the open­ing of Jackie Chan’s new film Vanguard.”</p>
    <p>The in­creased ca­pac­i­ties are a re­lief, but busi­ness will still be chal­leng­ing due to re­main­ing ca­pac­ity re­stric­tions and the post­pone­ment of highly an­tic­i­pated movies, she said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Sin­ga­pore’s largest cin­ema chain, Golden Vil­lage Multiplex, said it is pleased with the eas­ing of curbs.</p>
    <p>“With a strong line-up of movies wait­ing to be re­leased in the months ahead, we cer­tainly look for­ward to op­er­at­ing at max­i­mum ca­pac­ity in due course,” she said.</p>
    <p>Among the films to ben­e­fit from the in­creased seat­ing ca­pac­ity are the Chi­nese sports biopic Leap (opens next Thurs­day), star­ring Gong Li, the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Mr Prashant So­mo­sun­dram, gen­eral man­ager of in­die cin­ema The Pro­jec­tor, said cur­rent seat­ing ca­pac­ity rules have hit film fes­ti­vals hard be­cause these typ­i­cally fea­ture a lim­ited num­ber of screen­ings. Those ea­ger to watch movies at the cur­rent Mex­i­can Film Fes­ti­val have been es­pe­cially frus­trated by sold-out show­ings, he said.</p>
    <p>“We can now re­lease 30 more tick­ets per show. We can’t add more screen­ings, but we can let more view­ers in,” he said.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING AHEAD</p>
    <p>With a strong line-up of movies wait­ing to be re­leased in the months ahead, we cer­tainly look for­ward to op­er­at­ing at max­i­mum ca­pac­ity in due course.</p>
