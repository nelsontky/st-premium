    <p>We should up­hold the hum­ble struc­ture and no­ble ob­jec­tive of MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed re­vamp of the scheme to ex­pand some ben­e­fits is wel­come news al­though pre­mi­ums will have to rise for long-term sus­tain­abil­ity. Dur­ing this time of pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion, the au­thor­i­ties should look into the fol­low­ing:</p>
    <p>An­a­lyse the in­come from pre­mi­ums and claims costs of MediShield Life and In­te­grated Shield Plans (IPs). The cost bur­den should not dis­pro­por­tion­ately fall on those who do not claim.</p>
    <p>• Scrap IPs or un­bun­dle them from</p>
    <p>MediShield Life. Pol­i­cy­hold­ers who pre­fer treat­ment at Class A/B1-type wards, and at pri­vate hos­pi­tals, can pur­chase sep­a­rate in­sur­ance from pri­vate in­sur­ers, but not as an ex­ten­sion of MediShield Life. This way, com­pli­ca­tions in dis­burs­ing sub­si­dies do not arise.</p>
    <p>Al­low MediShield Life to have ba­sic rid­ers to in­crease claim lim­its and cov­er­age, but pegged at Class B2/C-type wards. Cur­rently, rid­ers are of­fered only in IPs and are pegged to Class A/B1-type wards, which is caus­ing the higher pre­mi­ums. • Cap hos­pi­tal treat­ment costs un­der MediShield Life and make hos­pi­tals re­spon­si­ble for cost over­runs in­stead of mak­ing pa­tients pay for un­nec­es­sary treat­ments.</p>
    <p>Re­view hos­pi­tal care costs and ex­clude items that are ir­rel­e­vant to ba­sic ser­vice de­liv­ery. For ex­am­ple, does the lo­ca­tion of a hos­pi­tal, say, in Or­chard Road ver­sus in the sub­urbs, fac­tor into the cost of treat­ment? Are the costs of un­der­utilised, spe­cialised equip­ment pooled across all treat­ment costs?</p>
    <p>How they de­ter­mine treat­ment costs should be re­viewed as the hos­pi­tals could have built in land costs and de­pre­ci­a­tion, and al­lo­cated these across all treat­ment costs.</p>
    <p>It is in­evitable that in­sur­ance pre­mi­ums have to rise to keep up with ris­ing health­care costs. But all stake­hold­ers have to en­sure a fair and eq­ui­table way of shar­ing the bur­den in­stead of an across-the-board in­crease.</p>
