    <p>Biotech firm Bi­o­lidics said it would take up to nine months to in­cor­po­rate tech­nol­ogy re­cently li­censed from the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) into a new serol­ogy test kit for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Its re­marks were in re­sponse to queries from the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) on Wed­nes­day around the tim­ing and de­tails of the Catal­ist-listed com­pany’s an­nounce­ment on Tues­day night.</p>
    <p>In that an­nounce­ment, Bi­o­lidics said it en­tered into a five-year li­cence agree­ment with A*Star on July 9 for non-ex­clu­sive world­wide rights to the agency’s tech­nol­ogy for use in de­tect­ing Covid-19 and to fur­ther work the tech­nol­ogy into new serol­ogy tests.</p>
    <p>Bi­o­lidics said on Thurs­day that it is in the ini­tial phase of the prod­uct’s de­vel­op­ment and had short­listed a num­ber of po­ten­tial part­ners that it is still as­sess­ing.</p>
    <p>“The com­pany would like to high­light again that there is no cer­tainty that the com­pany will be able to, among oth­ers, suc­cess­fully de­velop the serol­ogy tests which in­cor­po­rate the tech­nol­ogy,” it added.</p>
    <p>Bi­o­lidics said it was obliged to pay A*Star for the use of its tech­nol­ogy but that the terms were con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>It added that it had the right to use the tech­nol­ogy and de­velop its own en­hance­ments dur­ing the five-year agree­ment. Then it will own only the en­hance­ments it has cre­ated and will no longer have the right to use the tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The SGX also asked if there were con­di­tions to be met be­fore Bi­o­lidics could mar­ket serol­ogy tests us­ing A*Star’s tech­nol­ogy and when it ex­pected to do this.</p>
    <p>It also asked Bi­o­lidics how far along it was in in­cor­po­rat­ing the tech­nol­ogy into its tests.</p>
    <p>Bi­o­lidics said on Thurs­day that it in­tends to in­cor­po­rate the tech­nol­ogy only into new serol­ogy tests, and not its ex­ist­ing Covid-19 an­ti­body test kit.</p>
    <p>It said it could not in­di­cate when it would be able to mar­ket these serol­ogy tests, if de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>Bi­o­lidics must per­form test val­i­da­tions be­fore seek­ing reg­u­la­tory au­tho­ri­sa­tions and/or ap­provals, it said. Com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion de­pends on the time needed to ob­tain these ap­provals and its abil­ity to ob­tain suit­able prod­uct li­a­bil­ity in­surance.</p>
    <p>The firm said it was not able to in­di­cate the time re­quired for val­i­da­tion to be com­pleted or to get reg­u­la­tory ap­provals.</p>
    <p>There was no cer­tainty it could suc­cess­fully de­velop the tests, achieve reg­u­la­tory ap­provals and com­mer­cialise the tests, it added.</p>
    <p>The SGX also asked Bi­o­lidics why it de­layed an­nounc­ing the A*Star pact.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said the agree­ment was signed af­ter trad­ing hours on July 9. As July 10 was Polling Day and July 11 and 12 the week­end, the firm could fi­nalise the an­nounce­ment only on July 14. “The an­nounce­ment, which would not have a ma­te­rial im­pact on the cur­rent fi­nan­cial year, was dis­closed with the in­ten­tion of keep­ing the mar­ket up­dated,” Bi­o­lidics said.</p>
    <p>The spon­sor ad­vised Bi­o­lidics to call for a trad­ing halt on July 13 af­ter con­sul­ta­tion with the SGX.</p>
    <p>Bi­o­lidics shares jumped 29.3 per cent on Mon­day be­fore it called for a trad­ing halt at 12.19pm. It re­leased the A*Star deal an­nounce­ment on Tues­day at 10.46pm, be­fore lift­ing the halt ahead of the mar­ket’s open­ing bell on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Bi­o­lidics shares closed up 6.4 per cent at 41.5 cents yes­ter­day.</p>
