    <p>A fi­nanc­ing pack­age of US$6 bil­lion (S$8.1 bil­lion) is be­ing pre­pared by in­vest­ment bank JP Mor­gan to fund a pro­posed Fifa-backed su­per league in­volv­ing up to 18 top Euro­pean teams, in­clud­ing Liver­pool and Manch­ester United. The com­pe­ti­tion is pro­vi­sion­ally slated to be­gin in 2022.</p>
    <p>More than a dozen top Euro­pean foot­ball teams, in­clud­ing Liver­pool and Manch­ester United, are in dis­cus­sions to join a new Fi­fabacked com­pe­ti­tion, Sky News re­ported, cit­ing uniden­ti­fied peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>A fi­nanc­ing pack­age worth US$6 bil­lion (S$8.1 bil­lion) is be­ing pre­pared to as­sist in the mak­ing of the new league, the re­port said and in­vest­ment bank JP Mor­gan is in talks to pro­vide that debt fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Teams from France, Eng­land, Ger­many, Italy, in­clud­ing cham­pi­ons Ju­ven­tus, and Spain are in­volved in the talks and a pro­vi­sional start could oc­cur as soon as 2022.</p>
    <p>The new tour­na­ment would in­clude as many as 18 teams, in­volve games played dur­ing the reg­u­lar Euro­pean sea­son and ex­pected prize money worth sev­eral hun­dreds of mil­lions of pounds for the win­ners.</p>
    <p>While a for­mal an­nounce­ment may hap­pen by the end of this month, de­tails in­clud­ing the list of par­tic­i­pat­ing clubs have yet to be fi­nalised and the plans could still fall apart, Sky said.</p>
    <p>Any new tour­na­ment would com­pete with the Cham­pi­ons League, Europe’s top club com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The Cham­pi­ons League has been among the most-watched sport­ing events on TV world­wide, with the 2014 fi­nal draw­ing an es­ti­mated 380 million view­ers – more than three times the Su­per Bowl’s au­di­ence the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>Uefa awarded more than €2 bil­lion (S$3.2 bil­lion) to clubs through­out the course of last sea­son’s edi­tion, which ended in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Talks of a Euro­pean su­per league in­volv­ing the re­gion’s big­gest clubs have re­peat­edly popped up in re­cent years, but have usu­ally been met with op­po­si­tion from politi­cians, fan groups and na­tional foot­ball bod­ies over con­cerns do­mes­tic leagues would suf­fer as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>“The au­thors of that idea – if they re­ally ex­ist, be­cause there is no­body ac­tu­ally de­fend­ing it – not only show a to­tal ig­no­rance of the or­gan­i­sa­tion and cus­toms of Euro­pean and world foot­ball, but also a se­ri­ous ig­no­rance of the au­dio­vi­sual rights mar­kets,” said Span­ish La Liga pres­i­dent Javier Te­bas.</p>
    <p>“A project of this type will mean se­ri­ous eco­nomic dam­age to the or­gan­is­ers them­selves and to those en­ti­ties that fi­nance it, if they ex­ist, be­cause they’re never of­fi­cial.”</p>
    <p>Uefa also de­nounced the plan as “bor­ing” and would not take off as the Cham­pi­ons League was al­ready the “best sports com­pe­ti­tion in the world”. A state­ment read: “Uefa and the clubs are com­mit­ted to build on such strength, not to de­stroy it to cre­ate a su­per league of 10, 12, even 24 clubs.”</p>
    <p>Fifa said through a spokesman that it “does not wish to com­ment and par­tic­i­pate in any spec­u­la­tion about top­ics which come up ev­ery now and then”.</p>
    <p>United ex­ec­u­tive vice-chair­man Ed Wood­ward yes­ter­day de­nied claims the Red Devils were in talks, claim­ing he did not “know where that story came from”.</p>
    <p>While plans for a su­per league have long been mooted but never ma­te­ri­alised, the coron­avirus pan­demic may ac­cel­er­ate its pos­si­ble for­ma­tion, given that clubs world­wide – even elite ones – are suf­fer­ing badly from the lack of match day rev­enue.</p>
    <p>United yes­ter­day posted a £23 million (S$40.9 million) loss for the fi­nan­cial year to June 30, with Wood­ward la­belling the shutout of fans, who are “the bedrock of this game” as “frus­trat­ing”.</p>
    <p>A fresh in­jec­tion of funds could be wel­come, af­ter The Times of Lon­don re­ported Uefa will cut Cham­pi­ons League and Europa League prize money over the next five sea­sons be­cause of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Uefa has in­formed its mem­ber as­so­ci­a­tions it lost £514 million ow­ing to a drop in TV and spon­sor­ship in­come af­ter the knock­out stage from the quar­ter-fi­nals was changed to a one-off game for­mat.</p>
    <p>Stag­ing the games be­hind closed doors at neu­tral lo­ca­tions ex­ac­er­bated the losses, with The Times say­ing that English Premier League clubs can ex­pect to see TV and prize money drop by about four per cent.</p>
    <p>NOT THE RIGHT PROJECT</p>
    <p>The au­thors of that idea – if they re­ally ex­ist, be­cause there is no­body ac­tu­ally de­fend­ing it – not only show a to­tal ig­no­rance of the or­gan­i­sa­tion and cus­toms of Euro­pean and world foot­ball, but also a se­ri­ous ig­no­rance of the au­dio­vi­sual rights mar­kets.</p>
