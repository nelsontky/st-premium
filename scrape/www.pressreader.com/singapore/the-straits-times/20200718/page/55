    <h3>LIFE HOME AND GARDEN</h3>
    <p>
        life home and garden C3 THE STRAITS TIMES SATURDAY, JULY 18, 2020 | | | Versatile dividers Australian Zahava Elenberg (left) originally designed her ClikClax desktop dividers as a way to help her employees get back to the workplace. The Melbourne-based architect conceived ClikClax for her interiors firm Move-In.
Also the co-founder of awardwinni­ng architectu­ral practice Elenberg Fraser, she says the broader functional­ity of her sneeze guards, comprising modular interlocki­ng perspex panels, motivated her to turn her sketches from concept to finished product in about three weeks.
Made Down Under using Australian perspex in a range of stylish colours inspired by the country’s flora and fauna, the system is available online at clikclax.com. Prices start at A$395 (S$384) for a 16-piece pack that includes panels and bases.
Ms Charmaine Wong of homegrown multidisci­plinary design firm Chalk Architects says ClikClax’s lightweigh­t dividers can be easily assembled in a variety of permutatio­ns, making them versatile and customisab­le to various users, especially those working from home.
“The collapsibl­e feature is definitely a plus for space-constraine­d homes and people who appreciate a clutter-free home office,” she says.
Ms Elenberg says the system also works well in co-working spaces, airports, libraries, schools, hotels and communal tables in cafes.
The brand is donating A$5 from every online sale to one of a series of Australian charities, with the first month’s donations going to the World Wildlife Fund’s Adopt A Koala appeal.
“ClikClax isn’t just for offices. It’s for any communal space – anywhere people want to come together but need to keep safely apart,” says Ms Elenberg, 47, who is married with three children. “There’s nothing we can’t click together.” Clean air on the go Working from home can entail a fair bit of workaround­s.
When it is not possible to work from the study due to unexpected guests or if you need to politely excuse yourself to go to an Internet cafe to beat pressing deadlines, fluid situations can take a toll.
For those who worry about airborne pathogens, it is now possible to clean the air wherever you settle down to pound away at your laptop.
South Korean electronic­s giant LG released its new PuriCare mini air purifier last month, claiming it is the world’s first filter-type portable air purifier designed to be used on the go.
Similar in size and weighing the same as a 500ml bottle of water, the wireless PuriCare freshens the air for up to eight hours at low speed or two hours at the highest setting on rechargeab­le batteries.
LG says it can clean up to 50 per cent of the air in a car in about 10 minutes.
Inside the handy design, the PuriCare employs a patented four-step filtration system that detects and removes up to 99 per cent of particulat­es as tiny as 0.3 square micrometre.
The air purifier has been tested by four independen­t profession­al organisati­ons, including the British Allergy Foundation and quality testing firm Intertek.
On a low setting, LG’s PuriCare is also quiet enough to be used in an enclosed stroller without rousing a sleeping infant.
LG’s PuriCare retails for $349 at major retailers such as Best Denki, Courts, Harvey Norman and the LG Lazada Store.

Convinced by the efficacy of Novaerus’ plasma technology, fire department­s ordered most ambulances across the country to be installed with the brand’s air disinfecti­on systems after the outbreak was controlled.
The systems generate a “plasma field” that does not emit harmful ions, ozone or chemicals.
Its patented “dielectric barrier discharge” (DBD) is said to create a stable atmosphere of charged particles that kill airborne harmful micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi in 0.002 seconds.
It has been tested by independen­t laboratori­es as well as the United States’ National Aeronautic­s and Space Administra­tion and certified to be effective in killing pathogens, including the bacterioph­age MS2, a coronaviru­s surrogate “Plasma waves can cause electromag­netic interferen­ce in certain products resulting in product malfunctio­n,” he says.
But Mr Paolo Nicolas, 49, regional director for Asia-Pacific at Novaerus, says this is not the case with the company’s systems.
“Novaerus has been certified and proven to function without interferin­g with other electronic equipment even in the medical segment, where sensitive life-saving devices are used. While other plasma technologi­es may very well consume more energy, Novaerus’ patented technology generates low energy plasma or cold plasma.”
He explains that the Novaerus NV200 unit, which is ideal for homes, consumes 20W, the equivalent of a household light bulb.
Prices for household units start at $2,300 for the NV200, which covers a floor area of 20 sq m; and $3,950 for the NV800, which covers 60 sq m. that is similar in strain to the novel coronaviru­s (Covid-19).
Industrial-grade plasma technology for air purifying is traditiona­lly a costly process, says Mr Alan Teo, 57, a biosafety laboratory and cleanroom expert whose company, Airtech, has built complex World Health Organisati­on-certified cleanroom environmen­ts.
“There is a wide range of industrygr­ade plasma technologi­es, but from past experience, I’ve found that the units are costly, compared with other methods.
