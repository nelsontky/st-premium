    <p>The five-week gap be­tween the fil­ing of the po­lice re­port by Mr Liew Mun Leong and his son and po­lice of­fi­cers vis­it­ing the scene was a breach of a le­gal re­quire­ment as well as po­lice pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>Dis­ci­plinary ac­tion is be­ing taken against the of­fi­cer con­cerned as well as his su­per­vi­sor, said Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam yes­ter­day in his replies to Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai after he de­liv­ered a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the Parti Liyani case.</p>
    <p>The de­lay in the po­lice visit to the crime scene was one of the rea­sons for the High Court’s de­ci­sion in Septem­ber to ac­quit Ms Parti of steal­ing from her em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment, Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn found that there was a break in the chain of cus­tody of the items that were said to have been stolen. Ms Parti had packed the items into three boxes after she was fired on Oct 28, 2016.</p>
    <p>She re­turned to In­done­sia that night after Mr Karl Liew agreed to send the boxes to her. The next day, the boxes were opened by the Liews, who found items that they said be­longed to them.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan said it could not be proven that Ms Parti had taken the items that were even­tu­ally doc­u­mented by the po­lice be­cause the boxes might have been in­ter­fered with while they were with the Liews.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Shan­mugam said the po­lice should have vis­ited the scene close to the time that the po­lice re­port was made on Oct 30, 2016.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are legally re­quired to re­spond to a crime scene promptly or as soon as prac­ti­ca­ble, he said. In this case, the po­lice went to the Liews’ home only on Dec 3, 2016.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said: “There can be no ex­cuse for this lapse on the part of the po­lice of­fi­cer.”</p>
    <p>He added that in­ter­nal investigat­ions are be­ing car­ried out in re­la­tion to the con­duct of the of­fi­cers in­volved in the case, and ac­tion will be taken as nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said he had asked for an ex­pla­na­tion for the lapses and was told the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer had been busy with a num­ber of on­go­ing pros­e­cu­tions, ar­rest op­er­a­tions and per­sonal mat­ters.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cer seemed to have been un­der a lot of work pres­sure and was in a predica­ment, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said he has asked for a re­view of the work­load of in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cers, but ac­knowl­edged there was no easy so­lu­tion to a man­power is­sue.</p>
    <p>He also noted it is not al­ways nec­es­sary for po­lice to seize items when in­ves­ti­gat­ing cases.</p>
    <p>How­ever, even if the items are not seized, the po­lice have to ob­tain a proper record of the ev­i­dence, such as by tak­ing pho­to­graphs of the items.</p>
    <p>“In this case, care­ful pho­tog­ra­phy, soon after the po­lice re­port was filed, may have been good enough. But that was not done. I said, there can be no ex­cuse,” he added.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter also ad­dressed a point raised by Jus­tice Chan that Ms Parti had not been given a Ba­hasa In­done­sia in­ter­preter for her first four state­ments.</p>
    <p>He said the po­lice of­fi­cers be­lieved in good faith that Ms Parti un­der­stood Malay. She also chose to speak in Malay, had worked in Sin­ga­pore for over 20 years, and did not ask for an in­ter­preter dur­ing the record­ing.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, an in­ter­preter was pro­vided in record­ing her fi­nal state­ment, which dealt with the ma­jor­ity of ar­eas cov­ered in the ear­lier state­ments, and when the charges were served on her.</p>
    <p>“On that ba­sis, her fi­nal state­ment is not af­fected by any in­ter­pre­ta­tion is­sue,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam has also asked the po­lice to ask what lan­guage ac­cused per­sons wish to speak in, and also – which they do – to ex­plain briefly what the process en­tails, the pur­pose of the state­ment, and that the ac­cused may ask for an in­ter­preter at any time.</p>
    <p>Dis­ci­plinary ac­tion is be­ing taken against the of­fi­cer con­cerned as well as his su­per­vi­sor, said Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam yes­ter­day in his replies to Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai after he de­liv­ered a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the Parti Liyani case.</p>
