    <p>VI­ENNA • Aus­trian po­lice have ar­rested 14 peo­ple in raids linked to the deadly shoot­ing ram­page in Vi­enna and have found no ev­i­dence that a sec­ond shooter was in­volved, In­te­rior Min­is­ter Karl Ne­ham­mer said.</p>
    <p>“There have been 18 raids in Vi­enna and Lower Austria and 14 peo­ple have been de­tained,” Mr Ne­ham­mer told a tele­vised press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added that po­lice be­lieve Mon­day’s shoot­ing in cen­tral Vi­enna was car­ried out by a lone gun­man, Ku­j­tim Fe­jzu­lai, a 20-yearold Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) sym­pa­thiser who was killed by po­lice on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>The man was wear­ing an “ex­plo­sives belt” that turned out to be fake.</p>
    <p>The video ma­te­rial eval­u­ated by the po­lice “does not at this time show any ev­i­dence of a sec­ond at­tacker”, Mr Ne­ham­mer said.</p>
    <p>Vi­enna po­lice chief Ger­hard Puer­stl said at the same press con­fer­ence that other peo­ple who have shown sup­port for ISIS were un­der ob­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>“The strength­ened po­lice pres­ence will con­tinue,” he added.</p>
    <p>Fe­jzu­lai, a dual Aus­trian and Mace­do­nian na­tional, was con­victed of a ter­ror of­fence in April last year for try­ing to travel to Syria. He was sen­tenced to 22 months in prison, but was freed on pa­role in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­ham­mer said Fe­jzu­lai had been on a de-rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion pro­gramme and had man­aged to se­cure an early re­lease.</p>
    <p>“The per­pe­tra­tor man­aged to fool the jus­tice sys­tem’s de-rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion pro­gramme, to fool the peo­ple in it, and to get an early re­lease through this,” he said.</p>
    <p>Asked whether the pro­gramme had failed, Mr Ne­ham­mer said there was a “frac­ture” in the sys­tem. While he said he did not want to “point fin­gers... we must look very closely at what can be im­proved”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­ham­mer re­peated calls for the public to stay off the streets.</p>
    <p>Four peo­ple – an el­derly man and woman, a young passer-by and a wait­ress – were killed in the at­tack, and 22 peo­ple in­clud­ing a po­lice­man were wounded, Mr Ne­ham­mer said.</p>
    <p>Vi­enna’s mayor said three peo­ple were still in crit­i­cal con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Aus­trian Chan­cel­lor Se­bas­tian Kurz, 34, who has been thrust into the fore­front of Europe’s bat­tle with rad­i­cal Is­lam, held an emer­gency meet­ing yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“This is not a strug­gle be­tween Chris­tians and Mus­lims, or be­tween Aus­tri­ans and mi­grants,” Mr Kurz said in a tele­vised speech to the na­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s a strug­gle be­tween the many who be­lieve in peace and the few who seek war. A strug­gle be­tween civil­i­sa­tion and barbarism.”</p>
    <p>Like French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, Mr Kurz has taken a hard­line on rad­i­cal Is­lamist ide­ol­ogy and the at­tack in the short term at least will prob­a­bly vin­di­cate those ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“We will de­fend our val­ues, our way of liv­ing and our democ­racy,” Mr Kurz said. “We will hunt the per­pe­tra­tors, their back­ers and their sup­port­ers, and will bring them to jus­tice.”</p>
    <p>Wit­nesses to the at­tack had de­scribed crowds in bars be­ing fired on with au­to­matic ri­fles on Mon­day night, as many peo­ple took ad­van­tage of a last evening out be­fore the start of a na­tion­wide coro­n­avirus cur­few.</p>
    <p>Six lo­ca­tions were at­tacked in cen­tral Vi­enna, start­ing out­side the main syn­a­gogue, which was closed.</p>
    <p>A wit­ness, Vi­enna rabbi Schlomo Hofmeis­ter, said he could not be cer­tain whether there was more than one shooter.</p>
    <p>“I saw one per­son. Later, I saw videos and I’m not sure it was the same one. I find it very dif­fi­cult to iden­tify some­one in a frac­tion of a sec­ond,” Mr Hofmeis­ter told Reuters television. “At that mo­ment, I also did not pay at­ten­tion to what he looks like.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment an­nounced three days of na­tional mourn­ing and a minute’s si­lence at noon.</p>
    <p>APA news agency re­ported that mul­ti­ple homes had been searched and ar­rests made, cit­ing the In­te­rior Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Po­lice sealed off much of the his­toric cen­tre of the city overnight, urg­ing the public to take shel­ter wher­ever they were.</p>
    <p>Many sought refuge in bars and ho­tels, while public trans­port in the area was shut down.</p>
    <p>Mr Oskar Deutsch, head of Vi­enna’s Jewish com­mu­nity, which has of­fices ad­join­ing the syn­a­gogue on a nar­row cob­bled street dot­ted with bars, tweeted that it was not clear whether the syn­a­gogue or the of­fices had been a tar­get.</p>
    <p>Videos are cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia of a gun­man run­ning down a cob­bled street shoot­ing and shout­ing.</p>
    <p>One video shows a man gun­ning down a per­son out­side what ap</p>
    <p>peared to be a bar on the street where the syn­a­gogue is lo­cated.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre of Vi­enna was largely de­serted yes­ter­day, with many shops closed.</p>
    <p>CIVIL­I­SA­TION VS BARBARISM</p>
    <p>This is not a strug­gle be­tween Chris­tians and Mus­lims, or be­tween Aus­tri­ans and mi­grants. It’s a strug­gle be­tween the many who be­lieve in peace and the few who seek war. A strug­gle be­tween civil­i­sa­tion and barbarism.</p>
    <p>AUS­TRIAN CHAN­CEL­LOR SE­BAS­TIAN KURZ</p>
    <p>SHOOT­ING OF MOVIE?</p>
    <p>At the be­gin­ning, I thought to my­self that maybe we were mak­ing an Amer­i­can film or that they had drunk too much.</p>
    <p>MR JIMMY EROGLU, a waiter. GUN­SHOTS NOT EX­PECTED</p>
    <p>If you hear these noises in Austria, you don’t think they’re gun­shots, you re­ally don’t.</p>
    <p>MR GERNOT GRUBER, who said he ini­tially thought the sounds were fire­works set off by peo­ple ahead of the coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
