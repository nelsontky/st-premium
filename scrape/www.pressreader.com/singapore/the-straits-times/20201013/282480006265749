    <p>FIC­TION D: A TALE OF TWO WORLDS By Michel Faber</p>
    <p>Dou­ble­day/296 pages/$34.52/ Avail­able at bit.ly/TaleTW_Faber</p>
    <p>Fans of au­thor Michel Faber will know that his writ­ing of­ten de­fies cat­e­gori­sa­tion into easy gen­res.</p>
    <p>So D: A Tale Of Two Worlds takes the form of a young adult nar­ra­tive that pil­fers from gen­res rang­ing from Vic­to­rian melo­drama to English fairy tales to mod­ern­day fables.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing in that pre­ced­ing sen­tence can be chal­lenged. To call this a young-adult book is a mis­nomer, be­cause the av­er­age young adult is likely to miss all the Charles Dick­ens ref­er­ences, from Mag­witches – here, they are lit­er­ally witchy crones – to Mr Pum­ble­chook.</p>
    <p>Faber says in a note that this book was fin­ished in time for the 150th an­niver­sary of Dick­ens’ death, but this seems en­tirely co­in­ci­den­tal, since he also says the book was be­gun 35 years ago.</p>
    <p>Fans of Vic­to­rian melo­drama are likely to look askance at the plot­ting. Af­ter a promis­ing start – in which the young fe­male pro­tag­o­nist Dhik­ilo Saxardiid Sa­mawada Bent­ley es­capes her war-torn home­land of So­ma­liland as a baby and is adopted by the very English cou­ple of Ruth and Malcolm, who dwell in the town of Caw­ber – the story veers from melo­drama to straight fan­tasy ter­ri­tory, as the let­ter “D” be­gins to go miss­ing and Dhik­ilo goes on a quest to re­store it.</p>
    <p>Devo­tees of English fan­tasy sto­ries will likely take to the mid­dle sec­tions where, af­ter Dhik­ilo steps through a gi­ant book – a la C.S. Lewis’ The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe – she en­ters the land of Limi­nus and en­coun­ters a mot­ley crew of races in Gul­liver fash­ion.</p>
    <p>But Limi­nus and its odd peo­ples re­mind one more of Roald Dahl’s Loom­pa­land and Frank Baum’s Oz than the lit­er­ary metaphors of Jonathan Swift.</p>
    <p>By this time, read­ers would ei­ther have given up on the flat pac­ing or been charmed by the ec­cen­tric de­tours so char­ac­ter­is­tic of Faber.</p>
    <p>This is no sur­prise, as the au­thor has carved out a sin­gu­lar fic­tional path in his ca­reer. This is the guy who cre­ated the charm­ingly hor­rific first-per­son alien­hunter nar­ra­tive of Un­der The Skin and up­ended Vic­to­rian gen­der con­structs spec­tac­u­larly in The Crim­son Pe­tal And The White, while telling a seem­ingly con­ven­tional Vic­to­rian tale about a busi­ness­man un­done by his women. One does not pick up his work with the ex­pec­ta­tion of lin­ear nar­ra­tives.</p>
    <p>So the charms of D lie in oc­ca­sional moments of un­ease, which Faber is a mas­ter at cre­at­ing – the ter­ri­ble suf­fer­ing of the Droods, a friendly race Dhik­ilo meets in an hour of need in Limi­nus, is re­vealed in a sin­gle sen­tence that en­com­passes end­less hor­ror.</p>
    <p>There is also a five-star ho­tel which, af­ter its ini­tial com­forts, becomes a death trap. The chap­ter in which it ap­pears could well have been a stand­alone short story.</p>
    <p>And therein lies the one weak­ness of this novella. Its chap­ters some­times feel too frag­mented to co­here into a sin­gle nar­ra­tive, pos­si­bly the re­sult of its long ges­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, Faber’s imag­i­na­tion is a pow­er­ful thing that lures the reader into a vividly imag­ined world. The “real” world which Dhik­ilo in­hab­its of­fers the same ter­rors as the cur­rent world we live in: war, bul­ly­ing and racism. Life­long book nerds will iden­tify with Dhik­ilo’s plea­sure in the es­cape of­fered by words and lan­guage.</p>
    <p>The au­thor’s own plea­sure in words is pal­pa­ble in the play­ful seg­ments where the let­ter D is dropped from cer­tain sen­tence con­struc­tions, or when Dhik­ilo uses an in­ven­tive string of “D” words as truth-telling at a crit­i­cal nar­ra­tive mo­ment.</p>
    <p>It is not just English which Faber cel­e­brates. There is a par­tic­u­larly beau­ti­ful So­ma­liland word whose def­i­ni­tion he shares in in­fi­nite de­light: “Sax­ansaxo, for ex­am­ple, meant the smell and the cool­ness car­ried on the wind from a place where it’s rain­ing to a place where it isn’t.”</p>
    <p>D ar­rives like a cool­ness in these heated days, en­cour­ag­ing the reader to con­sider the power of lan­guage, the magic of words and the trans­port­ing na­ture of nar­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>The jour­ney might be a bit ragged com­pared with the au­thor’s other pol­ished gems, but it is still worth tak­ing.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Naomi Novik’s Up­rooted (Pan Macmil­lan, 2015, $18.95, avail­able at bit.ly/Up­root­ed_NN), in which hero­ine Ag­nieszka is cho­sen as once-adecade maiden sac­ri­fice to the im­mor­tal drag­onwiz­ard who pro­tects the vil­lage in which she lives. Ev­ery fairy-tale trope the reader ex­pects is turned on its head in won­der­ful ways.</p>
