    <p>•</p>
    <p>LONDON The world is be­com­ing less tol­er­ant of mi­grants, ac­cord­ing to a poll re­leased yes­ter­day, as Europe un­veiled a new asy­lum plan in the wake of a fire at an over­crowded camp in Greece that left thou­sands with­out shel­ter.</p>
    <p>Seven Euro­pean coun­tries – led by North Mace­do­nia, Hun­gary, Ser­bia and Croa­tia – topped the Gallup in­dex of the world’s least-ac­cept­ing coun­tries. But the sharpest changes in at­ti­tudes were in the Latin Amer­i­can coun­tries of Peru, Ecuador and Colom­bia, which have seen an in­flux of Venezue­lans flee­ing tur­moil at home.</p>
    <p>Canada was the most wel­com­ing coun­try to­wards mi­grants, fol­lowed by Ice­land and New Zealand, ac­cord­ing to the in­dex based on more than 140,000 in­ter­views in 145 coun­tries and re­gions.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey asked peo­ple their views about hav­ing mi­grants liv­ing in their coun­try, be­com­ing their neigh­bours and mar­ry­ing into their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>In­dex scores ranged from 1.49 in North Mace­do­nia to 8.46 i n Canada, just be­low the max­i­mum pos­si­ble score of 9.</p>
    <p>Gallup mi­gra­tion ex­pert Julie Ray said the slight global fall in ac­cep­tance – 5.21 last year, down from 5.34 i n 2016 – was driven by marked changes in Latin Amer­i­can coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Peru’s score tum­bled to 3.61 from 6.33 in 2016, while the num­ber of Colom­bians who said mi­grants liv­ing in their coun­try was a good thing dropped to 29 per cent from 61 per cent.</p>
    <p>The first Gallup Mi­grant Ac­cep­tance In­dex was con­ducted amid a back­lash fol­low­ing the 2015 mi­grant cri­sis in Europe, when more than a mil­lion peo­ple headed to the con­ti­nent flee­ing war and poverty in the Mid­dle East and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union coun­tries have long been at log­ger­heads over how to han­dle the in­flux of mi­grants, many of whom ar­rive in Mediter­ranean coun­tries af­ter per­ilous jour­neys by sea.</p>
    <p>The bloc’s ex­ec­u­tive un­veiled a plan yes­ter­day which legally obliges all mem­bers to host their share of refugees – some­thing re­jected by Poland and Hun­gary, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal was brought for­ward be­cause of the fire on the Greek is­land of Les­bos two weeks ago, which de­stroyed a mi­grant camp hold­ing more than 12,000 peo­ple – four times the num­ber it was sup­posed to.</p>
    <p>Among Euro­pean coun­tries, only Swe­den and Ire­land made the Gallup top 10 of most-ac­cept­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ms Ray said some peo­ple would be sur­prised by the pos­i­tive at­ti­tudes in the United States, where Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has made curb­ing im­mi­gra­tion a cornerston­e of his pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the fact that im­mi­gra­tion is such a hot topic in the US, Amer­i­cans are mostly very ac­cept­ing of mi­grants,” she said.</p>
    <p>The US ranked sixth in the in­dex, just be­hind Sierra Leone.</p>
    <p>Ms Ray said Mr Trump’s sup­port­ers were far more ac­cept­ing of mi­grants than the global av­er­age, scor­ing 7.10.</p>
    <p>World­wide, the in­dex showed ac­cep­tance of mi­grants was greater among younger gen­er­a­tions, peo­ple with higher lev­els of ed­u­ca­tion and those liv­ing in ur­ban rather than ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
