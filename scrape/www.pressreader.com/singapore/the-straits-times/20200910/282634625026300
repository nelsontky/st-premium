    <p>The two best movies this week come from Asian neigh­bours, but the sub­ject mat­ter could not be more dif­fer­ent: one is a fun zom­bie romp, the other a se­ri­ous de­pic­tion of a bat­tle cel­e­brated in Chi­nese his­tory.</p>
    <p>In South Korea, zom­bies do not fool around. As the sleeper hit Train To Bu­san (2016) showed, the un­dead there are fast and crafty, un­like the shuf­fling hordes seen in Amer­i­can films.</p>
    <p>#Alive (M18, 98 min­utes, Net­flix,</p>
    <p>) sticks to the South Korean tra­di­tion of hy­per­ac­tive zom­bies. They will need to be to make a meal of Joon-woo (Yoo Ah-in from 2018’s ac­claimed mys­tery drama Burn­ing), a video-game ad­dict who finds him­self alone in his apart­ment when the apoc­a­lypse strikes.</p>
    <p>What fol­lows is a uniquely</p>
    <p>Korean ver­sion of the sur­vivor for­mat. We have seen Amer­i­cans mak­ing forts of su­per­mar­kets, malls and Mex­i­can bars to fend off mon­sters. Of­ten, guns – usu­ally many – are in­volved.</p>
    <p>But in this near-per­fect blend of satire of sur­vival drama, the lonely and pet­ri­fied gamer must now play a ver­sion of the game in which the player ex­plores the sur­round­ings while pick­ing up makeshift weapons, tools and food.</p>
    <p>Who knew that zom­bie films could be as in­ven­tive and nerve-rack­ing as this, de­spite there not be­ing a dozen char­ac­ters with back­sto­ries to care about?</p>
    <p>The hordes com­ing for the he­roes in The Eight Hun­dred (NC16, 149 min­utes, now show­ing, ) are Ja­panese troops in­tent on elim­i­nat­ing a stub­born pocket of re­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>This is an ob­vi­ously pa­tri­otic re-en­act­ment of events, but then which war movie is not? Lone Sur­vivor (2013), Sav­ing Pri­vate Ryan (1998) and Amer­i­can Sniper (2014) are all deeply pa­tri­otic, but in a man­ner that feels com­fort­able and eas­ier to di­gest.</p>
    <p>That les­son – show, don’t tell – has not been lost on the mak­ers of this drama re-en­act­ing a piv­otal mo­ment in Chi­nese his­tory.</p>
    <p>Near the end of 1937, a de­ci­sion was made by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary to make a stand at the Si­hang Ware­house in Shang­hai, fol­low­ing months of hu­mil­i­at­ing de­feats at the hands of the Im­pe­rial Ja­panese Army.</p>
    <p>The film’s ti­tle refers to the name even­tu­ally given to the men and women in­volved in the fight.</p>
    <p>This ac­tion-ori­ented en­sem­ble piece fea­tures pow­er­ful per­for­mances from ac­tors like Wang Qianyuan and Jiang Wu, who play coun­try folk ask­ing if they are suck­ers for stick­ing around to fight when oth­ers have fled.</p>
    <p>It serves as a big-bud­get cor­rec­tive to myths about war gen­er­ated by West­ern cin­ema, such as the idea that Asians stood by to watch while Western­ers fought their bat­tles.</p>
    <p>As the film re­veals, from 1931 to 1945, Ja­pan’s bru­tal slog across China soaked up more than half its to­tal troop strength, with many bat­tles be­ing stand-offs, such as the one at the Si­hang Ware­house.</p>
    <p>Like that bat­tle, the events in the clas­sic 1911 chil­dren’s book The Se­cret Gar­den have been adapted for the screen sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>The lat­est at­tempt, The Se­cret Gar­den (PG, 100 min­utes, now show­ing, ) moves the time pe­riod for­ward a few decades, but makes more pro­found up­dates to its themes.</p>
    <p>Mary (Dixie Eg­er­ickx) lives in In­dia with her par­ents, but fol­low­ing the tur­bu­lence of Par­ti­tion – the di­vi­sion of Bri­tish In­dia into two in­de­pen­dent states, In­dia and Pak­istan – in 1947, she is left an or­phan and sent to the creepy es­tate of high-strung un­cle Archibald (Colin Firth).</p>
    <p>What fol­lows is an ex­plo­ration of trauma – Mary’s has to do with aban­don­ment, while Archibald grap­ples with fam­ily losses of his own. The mod­ern psy­cho­log­i­cal insight sits along­side fan­tasy el­e­ments taken from the book, in­clud­ing the mag­i­cal gar­den of the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Marc Mun­den de­ploys light re­al­is­tic hor­ror when por­tray­ing inner de­mons and then switches to Vic­to­rian-era whimsy to show the heal­ing process. The re­sult is not only tonally un­even, but it is also glib.</p>
    <p>Other films open­ing this week but not re­viewed in­clude the Tai­wanese ro­man­tic drama Do You Love Me As I Love You (PG13,</p>
    <p>109 min­utes, now show­ing), which stars Chen Yu, Tsao Yu-ning and Patricia Lin as good friends caught in a love tri­an­gle.</p>
