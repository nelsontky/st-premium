    <p>The Court of Ap­peal has up­held an or­der for a house, owned by now­bankrupt for­mer Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming Club (SSC) pres­i­dent Fred­die Koh and his wife, to be sold to pay off his debts of about $3.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in the light of the “ex­tra­or­di­nary cir­cum­stances” pre­sented by the Covid-19 pan­demic and the “ad­vanced age” of the cou­ple, who are in their 70s, the court granted Madam Ooi Ch­hooi Ngoh a one-year pe­riod to sell the house.</p>
    <p>The two-storey semi-de­tached house in Neram Road, in Sele­tar, has been es­ti­mated over the past years to be worth be­tween $5.7 mil­lion and $7.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>This is the first known case in which a court ap­pli­ca­tion is made on behalf of a bank­rupt to or­der the sale of a co-owned prop­erty, as op­posed to one made by a non-bank­rupt fel­low owner.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh owes $1.8 mil­lion to the club and $1.4 mil­lion to mort­gagee DBS Bank, but he and Madam Ooi have re­fused to sell their house fol­low­ing his bank­ruptcy in 2016.</p>
    <p>Last year, pri­vate trustees ap­pointed to sell and dis­trib­ute Mr Koh’s as­sets to his cred­i­tors filed an ap­pli­ca­tion in the High Court for the sale of the house.</p>
    <p>In writ­ten grounds of de­ci­sion last week, the Court of Ap­peal said there was no dif­fer­ence be­tween an ap­pli­ca­tion made by a co-owner and one made by the Of­fi­cial As­signee or pri­vate trustees in bank­ruptcy.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court of Ju­di­ca­ture Act gives the court a gen­eral power to or­der a sale of prop­erty where it is “nec­es­sary or ex­pe­di­ent” to do so, said Jus­tice An­drew Phang, who delivered the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh’s debt to the SSC arose from a dis­pute that started in 2009, when he was sued for defama­tion by four mem­bers of a previous man­age­ment com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Club money was used to de­fend the law­suit un­til 2012, when mem­bers voted to re­move him and to re­cover the le­gal costs. The club won a court bat­tle in 2016 to get back the funds. Mr Koh was made a bank­rupt by the SSC later that year.</p>
    <p>Madam Ooi re­sisted the ap­pli­ca­tion filed by the pri­vate trustees to sell the house.</p>
    <p>She ar­gued that she held a sen­ti­men­tal at­tach­ment to the house, where she has lived for more than 42 years, and that it was also home to her sec­ond son and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>She also ar­gued that it was not pos­si­ble to find an “equiv­a­lent prop­erty in the same area”.</p>
    <p>Her ar­gu­ments were re­jected last year by the High Court, which or­dered the house to be sold.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn said the prej­u­dice to Madam Ooi and her fam­ily was out­weighed by the fi­nan­cial prej­u­dice to un­se­cured cred­i­tor SSC, which has waited more than three years to re­claim its debt.</p>
    <p>He noted the cou­ple would be left with “more than suf­fi­cient” funds to buy al­ter­na­tive ac­com­mo­da­tion af­ter sell­ing the house and pay­ing Mr Koh’s cred­i­tors. How­ever, if the house was not sold, the club would never be able to re­cover the debt.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal said the High Court judge had cor­rectly car­ried out a bal­anc­ing ex­er­cise of the var­i­ous in­ter­ests at play in de­ter­min­ing whether a sale should be or­dered.</p>
    <p>The apex court noted that Mr Koh and Madam Ooi were given sev­eral op­tions to dis­charge his debt, in­clud­ing get­ting one of his chil­dren to buy over his half share of the prop­erty, but none of these sug­ges­tions was taken up.</p>
