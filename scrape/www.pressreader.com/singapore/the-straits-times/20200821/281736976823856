    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sian op­po­si­tion politi­cian Alexei Navalny was in a coma in a Siberian hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day after drink­ing a cup of tea that his spokesman said she be­lieved was laced with poi­son.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, a fierce critic of Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, started feel­ing ill when re­turn­ing to Moscow from Tomsk in Siberia by plane on Wed­nes­day morn­ing. He was car­ried off the plane on a stretcher after it made an emer­gency land­ing at Omsk.</p>
    <p>He was in in­ten­sive care and on an ar­ti­fi­cial lung ven­ti­la­tor in an Omsk hos­pi­tal, his spokesman Kira Yarmysh said.</p>
    <p>“We as­sume that Alexei was poi­soned with some­thing mixed into his tea. It was the only thing that he drank in the morn­ing. Alexei is now un­con­scious,” she said.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors gave con­tra­dic­tory in­for­ma­tion about his con­di­tion, say­ing that it had sta­bilised, but also that there was still a threat to his life and they were work­ing to save him.</p>
    <p>There is a long his­tory of Krem­lin foes be­ing poi­soned or fall­ing ill after sus­pected poi­son­ings.</p>
    <p>They i nclude Mr Alexan­der Litvi­nenko, who died in Lon­don in 2006 after drink­ing tea laced with polo­nium-210, and Mr Sergei Skri­pal, a for­mer dou­ble agent who was poi­soned with a nerve agent in 2018 in Sal­is­bury, Eng­land.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin has re­peat­edly de­nied in­volve­ment in those and other in­ci­dents, call­ing them an­tiRus­sian provo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Yarmysh said the po­lice had been called to the hos­pi­tal. Re­gional health min­istry spokesman Tatyana Shakirova con­firmed that Mr Navalny has been hos­pi­talised in Omsk and said doc­tors had as­sessed his con­di­tion as se­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>“Doc­tors are do­ing ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble to sta­bilise his con­di­tion,” she said. “The poi­son­ing ver­sion is one of sev­eral ver­sions be­ing con­sid­ered. It’s not pos­si­ble now to say what the rea­son was.”</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, 44, a lawyer and anti-cor­rup­tion ac­tivist, has served many stints in jail for or­gan­is­ing anti-Krem­lin protests and has been phys­i­cally at­tacked in the street by pro-gov­ern­ment ac­tivists. He has also helped in­ves­ti­ga­tions into what he has said are out­ra­geous ex­am­ples of of­fi­cial cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia holds re­gional elec­tions next month and Mr Navalny and his al­lies have been work­ing to in­crease sup­port for the can­di­dates they back.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­ger Pavel Lebe­dev, who was on the same plane as Mr Navalny, posted an ac­count of what he saw on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“At the start of the flight he went to the toi­let and didn’t come back. He started feel­ing re­ally sick. They strug­gled to bring him round and he was scream­ing in pain.”</p>
    <p>Footage posted on so­cial me­dia showed a mo­tion­less Mr Navalny be­ing stretchere­d into an am­bu­lance by medics.</p>
    <p>S7, the air­line he was trav­el­ling with, said he had not eaten or drunk any­thing on board.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny had had a cup of tea at a Tomsk air­port cafe be­fore the flight, Ms Yarmysh said.</p>
    <p>She drew a par­al­lel with an in­ci­dent last year in which Mr Navalny suf­fered an acute al­ler­gic re­ac­tion that one doc­tor said could have re­sulted from poi­son­ing with an un­known chem­i­cal.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously the same has been done to him now,” she added.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin yes­ter­day said it wished Mr Navalny well.</p>
    <p>“We know that he is in se­ri­ous con­di­tion... Like any cit­i­zen of the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion we wish him a speedy re­cov­ery,” said Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.</p>
    <p>Footage posted on so­cial me­dia showed a mo­tion­less Mr Navalny be­ing stretchere­d into an am­bu­lance by medics.</p>
