    <p>MADRID • Real Madrid coach Zine­dine Zi­dane hailed Karim Ben­zema as the best striker in French his­tory af­ter his match-win­ning dou­ble against Ath­letic Bil­bao pro­vi­sion­ally put the Span­ish cham­pi­ons top of La Liga on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Bil­bao’s An­der Capa had cancelled out Toni Kroos’ thump­ing opener be­fore Ben­zema struck twice late on, head­ing home a cross and fin­ish­ing clin­i­cally in stop­page time af­ter an in­ci­sive Luka Mo­dric pass.</p>
    <p>Af­ter­wards, Zi­dane, one of Les Bleus’ great­est play­ers, had no hes­i­ta­tion in putting his com­pa­triot top of the list, rat­ing him higher than a for­ward list that in­cludes their record scorer Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet, Kylian Mbappe, Jean-Pierre Papin, Olivier Giroud and Just Fon­taine.</p>
    <p>“For me, he’s the best – it’s very clear,” said the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 win­ner.</p>
    <p>“He’s proved it – he’s played at Real Madrid for a very long time, he has more than 500 ap­pear­ances, all his goals... his record, all he’s ac­com­plished here speaks for it­self.”</p>
    <p>He’s al­ways shown that he’s not a pure nine, he doesn’t only think about scor­ing. That’s why I like him so much.</p>
    <p>Ben­zema ar­rived at Real Madrid from Lyon in 2009, but was long over­shad­owed by Cris­tiano Ron­aldo un­til the five-time Bal­lon d’Or win­ner’s move to Ju­ven­tus in 2018.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, the 32-year-old broke Roberto Car­los’ club record for most ap­pear­ances by a nonS­pan­ish player (529).</p>
    <p>Ben­zema is also their top scorer this sea­son with 10 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions and Zi­dane claimed his game was still evolv­ing.</p>
    <p>“He’s a more ma­ture player these days,” said the 48-year-old.</p>
    <p>“But he’s al­ways shown that he’s not a pure nine, he doesn’t only think about scor­ing.</p>
    <p>“That’s why I like him so much, I love him, he’s not only think­ing about goals. He gets in­volved in the game, if he needs to pass to a team­mate he’ll do it.”</p>
    <p>Their fourth straight vic­to­ries in all com­pe­ti­tions put Zi­dane’s men level on 26 points with Real So­ciedad, who faced trou­bled Barcelona at the Nou Camp yes­ter­day, and cross-town ri­vals Atletico Madrid.</p>
