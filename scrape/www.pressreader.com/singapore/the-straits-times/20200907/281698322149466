    <p>An­other three new clus­ters of coron­avirus in­fec­tions – all in dor­mi­to­ries – were an­nounced by the Health Min­istry yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cas­sia @ Pen­juru, CDPL Tuas Dor­mi­tory and Kranji Lodge I were linked to 13, seven and five ear­lier con­firmed cases, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>De­spite all for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries hav­ing been an­nounced as cleared on Aug 11, new clus­ters con­tinue to emerge.</p>
    <p>In the past week alone, 12 clus­ters have resur­faced in dor­mi­to­ries that were pre­vi­ously cleared of the virus – the oth­ers are Cochrane Lodge I, Mandai Lodge I, Tuas South Dor­mi­tory, Blue Stars Dor­mi­tory, Cochrane Lodge II, Westlite Toh Guan dor­mi­tory, Changi Lodge II, North Coast Lodge and</p>
    <p>Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>Four com­mu­nity cases were re­ported yes­ter­day – a work pass holder and three work per­mit hold­ers. Two of the four were linked to pre­vi­ous cases, while the other two are cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>There were 13 im­ported cases – four Sin­ga­pore­ans, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents, a work pass holder, five work per­mit hold­ers and a stu­dent’s pass holder. They ar­rived from In­dia, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines be­tween Aug 23 and 26.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 23 of the 40 new coron­avirus cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,022.</p>
    <p>The Hoshino Cof­fee out­let at Raf­fles Hol­land V Mall and the White Restau­rant out­let at Jewel Changi Air­port were the lat­est to be added to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients. The full list of lo­ca­tions can be found on the min­istry’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from three cases two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from an av­er­age of one case a day to two a day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 66 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,318 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, 51 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 611 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan last De­cem­ber, has in­fected more than 27 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 880,000 have died.</p>
