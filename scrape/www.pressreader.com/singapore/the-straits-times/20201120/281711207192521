    <p>There was a sig­nif­i­cant spike in wrong­ful dis­missal claims in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, in tan­dem with the dip in local em­ploy­ment during that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 436 such claims were lodged un­der Sec­tion 14 of the Em­ploy­ment Act be­tween April and June, com­pared with be­tween 209 and 279 per quar­ter in the pre­ced­ing four quar­ters, said a re­port on em­ploy­ment stan­dards re­leased yesterday by tri­par­tite groups and the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>Of the 436 claims, 277 were re­solved by the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment (TADM), while 139 claims were re­ferred to the Em­ploy­ment Claims Tri­bunals for ad­ju­di­ca­tion. The re­main­ing 20 claims are pend­ing me­di­a­tion at TADM, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Many of the claims were lodged by em­ploy­ees who were un­happy over the abrupt man­ner in which they were let go, due in part to re­stric­tions on face-to-face meet­ings during the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“There is no ev­i­dence that more em­ploy­ers ter­mi­nated their em­ploy­ees un­fairly to deny them of re­trench­ment ben­e­fit,” said the re­port.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers have ex­pressed con­cern about the pos­si­bil­ity of more dis­guised re­trench­ments – when a company takes cost-cut­ting mea­sures and re­trenches em­ploy­ees with no in­ten­tion of filling the va­can­cies, but calls it con­trac­tual ter­mi­na­tion.</p>
    <p>There were 69 claims for re­trench­ment ben­e­fits lodged in the sec­ond quar­ter, which is low, said the re­port by MOM, TADM and the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep).</p>
    <p>In all, 1,506 wrong­ful dis­missal claims were lodged un­der the Em­ploy­ment Act and Child Devel­op­ment Co-Sav­ings Act be­tween April 1 last year and June 30 this year, in­clud­ing 75 by em­ploy­ees who said they had been dis­missed during preg­nancy. The to­tal pay­ment by em­ploy­ers to em­ploy­ees was $1.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>About a quar­ter of the claims un­der Sec­tion 14 of the Em­ploy­ment Act that have been me­di­ated by TADM were as­sessed to be sub­stan­ti­ated. The rest were not.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 333 dis­missal claims lodged un­der Sec­tion 14 of the Em­ploy­ment Act were by man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives earn­ing over $4,500 a month who have been newly covered un­der the Act since April 1 last year, when cov­er­age of core pro­vi­sions was ex­tended to all em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>An­other 115 dis­missal ap­peals were lodged un­der the Re­tire­ment and Re-em­ploy­ment Act and 65 were lodged un­der the In­dus­trial Re­la­tions Act be­tween April 1 last year and June 30 this year.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dence of salary claims among local em­ploy­ees has also been going up, said the re­port. Such claims could be for owed ba­sic salary, over­time pay, salary in lieu of no­tice and ma­ter­nity leave. The fig­ure rose last year to 1.53 salary claims per 1,000 em­ploy­ees, up from 1.43 in 2018. In the first half of this year, it rose to 1.73 on an an­nu­alised ba­sis.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dence of salary claims among for­eign em­ploy­ees also rose last year, to 4.98 salary claims per 1,000 em­ploy­ees, up from 4.45 in 2018, partly due to more group claims among for­eign con­struc­tion workers.</p>
    <p>But it de­creased in the first half of this year to 3.96 on an an­nu­alised ba­sis. With the workers quar­an­tined at dor­mi­to­ries, TADM re­solved salary is­sues that workers raised with For­ward As­sur­ance and Sup­port Team of­fi­cers so the workers did not have to lodge claims, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>Of the 13,591 salary claims lodged be­tween Jan 1 last year and June 30 this year, 90 per cent of em­ploy­ees fully re­cov­ered their salaries at TADM or the Em­ploy­ment Claims Tri­bunals.</p>
    <p>About half of the re­main­ing em­ploy­ees re­cov­ered part of the owed salaries. The amount re­cov­ered to­tals about $23 mil­lion over that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, MOM also launched a new self-help Key Em­ploy­ment Terms Ver­i­fi­ca­tion Tool on its web­site. Em­ploy­ees and em­ploy­ers can use it to check that their con­trac­tual terms on work­ing hours and salary pay­ments com­ply with the Em­ploy­ment Act.</p>
