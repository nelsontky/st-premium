    <p>IT’S UN­AC­CEPT­ABLE</p>
    <p>I recog­nise their age but the whole world is deal­ing with this pan­demic. I’m a fa­ther with chil­dren, young adults, I know peo­ple get things wrong. But I’m not ex­cus­ing that in this in­stance.</p>
    <p>GARETH SOUTH­GATE, Eng­land man­ager, on the be­hav­iour of young debu­tants Phil Fo­den and Ma­son Green­wood.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Eng­land man­ager Gareth South­gate has con­firmed that both Phil Fo­den and Ma­son Green­wood will play no part in the Na­tions League game in Den­mark to­day af­ter breach­ing Covid-19 pro­to­cols in Ice­land.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, he said they had both been iso­lated from the rest of the squad and would travel back to Bri­tain separately.</p>
    <p>Video footage emerged of Manch­ester City’s Fo­den and Manch­ester United’s Green­wood al­legedly meet­ing girls in their ho­tel room af­ter Satur­day’s 1-0 Na­tions League win in Reyk­javik. The footage came to light on Ice­landic out­let DV af­ter the girls shared videos on Snapchat on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately this morn­ing it was brought to my at­ten­tion that the two boys have bro­ken the Covid guide­lines in terms of our se­cure bub­ble – I had to de­cide they couldn’t have in­ter­ac­tion with the rest of the team,” South­gate said.</p>
    <p>“We are still get­ting the depths of the in­for­ma­tion. I’m not go­ing into any more de­tails un­til I’m clear.</p>
    <p>“These are two boys I don’t know par­tic­u­larly well at the mo­ment so I can’t speak in great depth. I have got to try and speak with them later. They have got re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and they have apol­o­gised.”</p>
    <p>South­gate also said that the right pre­cau­tions had been taken while the team are still in Ice­land so as not to put the Den­mark game at risk. “We are very clear that no other mem­bers of our party have been in con­tact with the two play­ers – (they) couldn’t join us for break­fast or train­ing. It is a very se­ri­ous sit­u­a­tion and we have treated it that way,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously they have been naive, we have dealt with it ap­pro­pri­ately. I recog­nise their age but the whole world is deal­ing with this pan­demic. I’m a fa­ther with chil­dren, young adults, I know peo­ple get things wrong. But I’m not ex­cus­ing that in this in­stance.”</p>
    <p>Both play­ers made their full in­ter­na­tional de­buts against Ice­land, Fo­den, 20, from the start and Green­wood, 18, as a sub­sti­tute. Like all of the Eng­land squad, they were sub­ject to strict Covid-19 health pro­to­cols to avoid Ice­land’s quar­an­tine rules. These in­cluded not meet­ing any­one other than the Eng­land squad and staff dur­ing the team’s stay in Ice­land.</p>
    <p>City is­sued a state­ment say­ing Fo­den’s ac­tions were “to­tally in­ap­pro­pri­ate” and be­low the stan­dard of be­hav­iour ex­pected of a City and Eng­land player.</p>
    <p>United also re­acted to the news. “Manch­ester United are li­ais­ing with the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion and are dis­ap­pointed with the ac­tions of Ma­son Green­wood over this sit­u­a­tion,” the club said.</p>
    <p>It is the lat­est off-field in­ci­dent in­volv­ing an Eng­land player in re­cent weeks. United cap­tain Harry Maguire was given a sus­pended prison sen­tence by a Greek court af­ter be­ing ac­cused of var­i­ous charges fol­low­ing an al­leged brawl in Mykonos.</p>
    <p>For the match in Copen­hagen to­day, Conor Coady, Ains­ley Mait­land-Niles, Dean Hen­der­son, Kalvin Phillips and Jack Gre­al­ish are hop­ing to make their Eng­land bows. Kyle Walker’s red card against Ice­land and sub­se­quent sus­pen­sion means Trent Alexan­derArnold is likely to re­turn at right­back.</p>
    <p>The Three Lions will come up against many fa­mil­iar faces, with Le­ices­ter’s Kasper Sch­me­ichel, Chelsea’s An­dreas Chris­tensen, for­mer Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur mid­fielder Chris­tian Erik­sen – now with In­ter Mi­lan – and Spurs’ Pierre-Emile Ho­jb­jerg all in line to fea­ture.</p>

Un&#xAD;der strict Covid-19 pro&#xAD;to&#xAD;col, they can&#xAD;not meet any&#xAD;one out&#xAD;side the Eng&#xAD;land squad and staff.</p>
