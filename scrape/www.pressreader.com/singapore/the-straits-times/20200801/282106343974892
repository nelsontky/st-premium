    <p>Piles of rub­bish in­clud­ing plas­tic snack wrap­pers, glass bot­tles and slip­pers have washed up on the beach at East Coast Park.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited the beach yes­ter­day, a group of peo­ple were pick­ing up the rub­bish af­ter their friend Tong Chee San, 32, spot­ted the trash dur­ing his usual run and asked them to help him clean it up.</p>
    <p>“When I saw this mess, I de­cided to do some­thing. Ev­ery­one should do their part to dis­pose of the garbage,” said Mr Tong, who is a re­search fel­low at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>An­other beach­goer, Ms Sa­man­tha Lau, 25, noted that the de­bris along the beach also in­cluded wood frag­ments with sharp nails stick­ing out, which posed a dan­ger to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“I know NEA cleans the beaches very of­ten and the beaches are al­ways well-main­tained when I visit,” she added, re­fer­ring to the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency.</p>
    <p>The “vol­ume” of rub­bish she saw yes­ter­day sur­prised her, al­though she was aware that more trash washes ashore dur­ing the south-west mon­soon sea­son be­tween May and Oc­to­ber.</p>
