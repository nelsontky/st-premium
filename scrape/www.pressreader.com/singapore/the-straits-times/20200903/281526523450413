    <p>The founders of SK Jew­ellery Group have launched a vol­un­tary con­di­tional cash of­fer of 15 cents per share to delist and pri­va­tise the company, they an­nounced in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day. The fam­ily busi­ness’ shares closed up 5.3 cents, or 55.8 per cent, to 14.8 cents, af­ter a trad­ing halt was lifted fol­low­ing the of­fer an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>The founders of SK Jew­ellery Group have launched a vol­un­tary con­di­tional cash of­fer of 15 cents a share to delist and pri­va­tise the company, they an­nounced in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day be­fore the stock mar­ket opened.</p>
    <p>The founders are Mr Peter Lim Yong Guan, the company’s non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man; his brother Daniel Lim Yong Sheng, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive; and their sis­ter Mary Lim Liang Eng, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and group chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Lim is also co-founder, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive of pawn­bro­ker MoneyMax Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>SK Jew­ellery shares closed up 5.3 cents, or 55.8 per cent, to 14.8 cents, af­ter a trad­ing halt was lifted fol­low­ing the of­fer an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>The shares had gained 8 per cent to 9.5 cents last Fri­day, be­fore a trad­ing halt was called at 4pm that day.</p>
    <p>At 15 cents a share, the of­fer price stands at a premium of 70.5 per cent over the stock’s clos­ing price of 8.8 cents last Thurs­day, its last full trad­ing day, and 94.8 per cent over t he three-month vol­umeweighte­d av­er­age price.</p>
    <p>It also ex­ceeds the high­est clos­ing price of the shares in over two years.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily busi­ness grew from a 700 sq ft shop in Be­dok Cen­tral in 1991 to a chain of more than 60 stores in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing up the group are the brands Soo Kee Jew­ellery, SK Jew­ellery and Love & Co.</p>
    <p>When the firm was listed on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s ju­nior Catal­ist board in 2015 at 30 cents a share, its mar­ket value was $168 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The buy­out of­fer val­ues the company at $84 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Lim sib­lings said pri­vatis­ing the company will pro­vide them with greater con­trol and man­age­ment flex­i­bil­ity to re­spond to chang­ing mar­ket con­di­tions and op­ti­mise the use of its re­sources.</p>
    <p>They in­tend to con­tinue de­vel­op­ing and grow­ing SK Jew­ellery’s ex­ist­ing busi­nesses, with no cur­rent in­ten­tions to make any ma­jor changes in busi­ness or lay off any em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>The of­fer is be­ing made through the Lims’ in­vest­ment hold­ing company, OroGreen In­vest­ment, with DBS Bank act­ing as its sole fi­nan­cial ad­viser.</p>
    <p>The Lim sib­lings and their company, Soo Kee Cap­i­tal, hold 82.61 per cent of SK Jew­ellery’s shares and have un­der­taken to ac­cept the of­fer.</p>
    <p>But the of­fer is still con­di­tional on re­ceiv­ing valid ac­cep­tances of 90 per cent and above.</p>
    <p>The of­fer – which is fi­nal – pro­vides an op­por­tu­nity for the company’s share­hold­ers to cash out at a premium to his­tor­i­cal mar­ket prices with­out in­cur­ring bro­ker­age and trad­ing costs, amid the un­cer­tain­ties sur­round­ing the long-term im­pact of the Covid-19 out­break and a chal­leng­ing out­look across the company’s busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, Thai­land and China, said the fil­ing.</p>
