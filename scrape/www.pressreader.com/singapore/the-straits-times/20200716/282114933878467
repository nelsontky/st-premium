    <p>Dur­ing a po­lice raid at the home of a for­mer se­nior bank ex­ec­u­tive, DVDs and other elec­tronic de­vices con­tain­ing 245 ob­scene films were seized.</p>
    <p>Ten of these films con­tained child pornog­ra­phy, with some in­volv­ing chil­dren pos­si­bly as young as four years old.</p>
    <p>Michael Frank Har­tung, a for­mer em­ployee of Deutsche Bank, was sen­tenced to 12 weeks’ jail yes­ter­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to two counts of pos­sess­ing ob­scene films. Two other charges of pos­sess­ing films with­out a valid cer­tifi­cate were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion by Se­nior Dis­trict Judge Bala Reddy dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Har­tung is cur­rently serv­ing a jail sen­tence of 5½ years for shar­ing in­for­ma­tion to pro­mote child sex ac­tiv­i­ties in the Philip­pines, of which he was con­victed last year af­ter a trial in the State Courts.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old Ger­man na­tional and Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent is ap­peal­ing against that con­vic­tion and sen­tence, court records show.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial last year, the court had heard that Har­tung dis­trib­uted the in­for­ma­tion to four men with­out re­al­is­ing that they were un­der­cover po­lice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion had said then that Har­tung gave ad­vice on pos­si­ble des­ti­na­tions for a sex tour fea­tur­ing mi­nors over­seas and shared his per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence with procur­ing young girls for sex­ual ser­vices, among other things.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court heard that the po­lice had seized var­i­ous items, in­clud­ing mo­bile phones and 235 DVDs, in a raid on Har­tung’s res­i­dence on Aug 30, 2016.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 225 ob­scene films were found in 225 of the DVDs.</p>
    <p>Seven of those films con­tained child abuse ma­te­rial, por­tray­ing pre-pubescent chil­dren en­gaged in sex­ual poses and ac­tiv­i­ties with adults and other chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Another 20 ob­scene films, three of which fea­ture adult men per­form­ing sex­ual acts on young girls, were found in other elec­tronic de­vices seized.</p>
    <p>“The ev­i­dence re­vealed that some of the young girls could be as young as four years old, based on the file­names of the films as well as the ap­pear­ance of the young girls,” Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor An­dre Ong said.</p>
    <p>In urg­ing the court to jail Har­tung for at least 15 weeks, the DPP noted, among other things, the high de­gree of child sex­ual ex­ploita­tion on at least 10 of the films and the “deeply de­praved na­ture of the acts per­formed on the child vic­tims”.</p>
    <p>The judge or­dered for Har­tung’s new sen­tence to com­mence af­ter he had served his cur­rent one.</p>
    <p>For each charge of pos­sess­ing ob­scene films, Har­tung could have been jailed for up to six months and fined at least $500 per film, to a to­tal amount of up to $20,000.</p>
