    <p>HONG KONGER CHEUNG KIE CHUNG, a for­mer pro­fes­sor found guilty of mur­der­ing his wife. |</p>
    <p>It is a grim tale that has gripped Hong Kong: a well-liked pro­fes­sor, trapped in a mar­riage that has soured, mur­ders his wife and stuffs her body into a suit­case.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the court will hear for­mer Hong Kong Univer­sity pro­fes­sor Cheung Kie Chung’s mit­i­ga­tion for pre­vent­ing law­ful burial be­fore sen­tenc­ing him to life in pri­son – for mur­der­ing his wife, Tina Chan, in Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>A seven-mem­ber High Court jury re­turned a guilty verdict last Thurs­day by a vote of 5-2, fol­low­ing an 11-day trial and after al­most eight hours of de­lib­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Cheung, 56, had ad­mit­ted to killing 53-year-old Madam Chan on Aug 17 two years ago at their res­i­dence at the univer­sity’s Wei Lun Hall, where he was war­den.</p>
    <p>He did not orig­i­nally ad­mit to mur­der but pleaded guilty to man­slaugh­ter charges, which was re­jected by the pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>The for­mer me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor had stran­gled his wife with a ca­ble wire while they were in bed at night.</p>
    <p>That was after they had re­port­edly ar­gued, with the vic­tim be­rat­ing Cheung for not stick­ing up for her dur­ing a dis­agree­ment with their daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>After the deed, Cheung hid his wife’s body in a suit­case and left it on the bal­cony. But as the body would soon start to smell, he bought six wooden planks and cre­ated a “cof­fin” wherein to hide the body. After­wards, he moved it to his univer­sity of­fice.</p>
    <p>The court was told by a cry­ing Cheung dur­ing his trial that he did not want to throw his wife’s body out. “I didn’t want to dump her body into the sea or at the trash col­lec­tion point.”</p>
    <p>“I feel ex­hausted fak­ing my­self, try­ing to look like I was wor­ried about... Tina (go­ing) miss­ing and pre­tend­ing to be search­ing for Tina with my kids and their aunt,” the ac­cused had cried out.</p>
    <p>Cheung later sub­mit­ted a miss­ing per­sons re­port but the po­lice be­came sus­pi­cions when they found closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage of him trans­port­ing a large wooden box from the dor­mi­tory to his of­fice in the univer­sity’s Hak­ing Wong build­ing. This was two days after he filed the re­port.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers raided his of­fice and found the bloody and foulsmelli­ng suit­case in the box.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the hear­ing, the jury was told by the cou­ple’s two adult chil­dren – Nancy and Scot – that the ar­gu­ments be­tween the pair were usu­ally pro­voked by the de­ceased.</p>
    <p>That said, Cheung had tes­ti­fied that the cou­ple had never phys­i­cally at­tacked one an­other.</p>
    <p>He also told the court that he was con­stantly in­sulted by his wife dur­ing their quar­rels – some of which were in the pres­ence of their chil­dren – and that he felt hu­mil­i­ated. He said his wife would say things like “you are com­pletely use­less” and “we would be beg­ging on the streets if we were to only rely on you”.</p>
    <p>He also said: “She would scold me with foul lan­guage very harshly. Even with my kids present, she would still do the same, I felt hu­mil­i­ated.”</p>
    <p>Money was also a thorn in their re­la­tion­ship. Po­lice found a credit note dated three months be­fore the mur­der, stat­ing that Cheung owed the de­ceased HK$6.7 mil­lion (S$1.16 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Cheung pre­vi­ously tes­ti­fied that his wife had asked him to write her three cheques to­talling HK$16.7 mil­lion as proof that he owed her money, but he did not have the funds to hon­our the cheques.</p>
    <p>He also tes­ti­fied that his wife or­dered the credit note, and that it was her re­quest that half of his monthly salary of HK$100,000 be­longed and should have been given to her each month. He was to pay her, in ret­ro­spect, a decade’s worth of her monthly claim via the cheque. He said he com­plied, not want­ing to be scolded again.</p>
    <p>De­fence lawyer Gra­ham Har­ris has asked Jus­tice Anthea Pang Po Kam for an ad­journ­ment for mit­i­ga­tion, where a let­ter signed by hun­dreds of peo­ple will be ten­dered in court.</p>
    <p>The High Court judge has said the jury should con­sider Cheung’s re­la­tion­ship with his wife, the char­ac­ter of Cheung and Chan, the psy­chol­o­gist’s tes­ti­mony and foren­sic ev­i­dence. She noted that two psy­chi­a­trists had tes­ti­fied that Cheung was suf­fer­ing from de­pres­sion and it was pos­si­ble he might have lost self-con­trol then.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Pang added that the jury should not only con­sider if Cheung could have his penalty re­duced be­cause of his men­tal ill­ness, but also whether his men­tal sta­tus would have made him vul­ner­a­ble to provo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>This re­quest was made in the light of the cou­ple hav­ing had a happy mar­riage for 30 years, be­fore the re­la­tion­ship started de­te­ri­o­rat­ing when their chil­dren started sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>This is not the first high-pro­file mur­der in­volv­ing a pro­fes­sor at a Hong Kong univer­sity in re­cent years. In 2015, a pro­fes­sor at The Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong mur­dered his wife and daugh­ter in a car by re­leas­ing car­bon monox­ide from a de­flat­ing yoga ball. He was sen­tenced to life im­pris­on­ment in 2018.</p>
    <p>LIV­ING A DOU­BLE LIFE</p>
    <p>I didn’t want to dump her body into the sea or at the trash col­lec­tion point... I feel ex­hausted fak­ing my­self, try­ing to look like I was wor­ried about... Tina (go­ing) miss­ing and pre­tend­ing to be search­ing for ’’ Tina with my kids and their aunt.</p>

    <p>HU­MIL­I­ATED IN FRONT OF KIDS</p>
    <p>She would scold me with foul lan­guage very harshly. Even with my kids present, she would still do the same, I felt hu­mil­i­ated. ’’</p>
