    <p>Den­mark’s State Serum In­sti­tute, which deals with in­fec­tious dis­eases, said a mu­tated strain of the coro­n­avirus had been found in</p>
    <p>12 peo­ple and five mink farms. Af­ter the coun­try or­dered a na­tional mink cull be­cause of the out­break of Covid-19 in the an­i­mal, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) is look­ing at biose­cu­rity around mink farms in coun­tries across the world to pre­vent “spillover events”.</p>
    <p>COPENHAGEN • Den­mark’s State Serum In­sti­tute, which deals with in­fec­tious dis­eases, has found mink-re­lated ver­sions of the coro­n­avirus in 214 peo­ple since June, ac­cord­ing to a re­port on its web­site.</p>
    <p>One strain of the mu­tated coro­n­avirus, which has prompted Den­mark to cull its en­tire herd of minks, has how­ever been found only in 12 peo­ple and on five mink farms so far.</p>
    <p>Den­mark had an­nounced strict new lock­down rules on Thurs­day in the north of the coun­try af­ter the au­thor­i­ties dis­cov­ered a mu­tated coro­n­avirus strain in minks bred in the re­gion, prompt­ing a na­tion­wide cull that will dev­as­tate the large pelt in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said on Wed­nes­day that it would cull all minks – up to 17 mil­lion – to pre­vent hu­man contagion with a mu­tated coro­n­avirus, which the au­thor­i­ties said could be more re­sis­tant to fu­ture vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Seven mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties in north­ern Den­mark, home to most of the coun­try’s mink farms, will face re­stric­tions on move­ment across county lines, while restau­rants and bars will be closed, Prime Min­is­ter Mette Fred­erik­sen said.</p>
    <p>Schools will be closed and all public trans­port will be shut un­til Dec 3, she said, en­cour­ag­ing res­i­dents in the re­gion to stay within their mu­nic­i­pal­ity and get tested.</p>
    <p>For Den­mark’s mink pelt in­dus­try, which racked up ex­ports of around US$800 mil­lion (S$1 bil­lion) last year and em­ploys 4,000 peo­ple, the cull could amount to a death knell. The in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tion for Dan­ish breed­ers called the move a “black day for Den­mark”.</p>
    <p>“Of course, we must not be the cause of a new pan­demic. We do not know the pro­fes­sional ba­sis for this as­sess­ment and risk... but the gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion is a dis­as­ter for the in­dus­try and Den­mark,” as­so­ci­a­tion chair­man Tage</p>
    <p>Ped­er­sen said.</p>
    <p>In its re­port, the in­sti­tute said lab­o­ra­tory tests showed the new strain had mu­ta­tions on its so­called spike pro­tein, a part of the virus that in­vades and in­fects healthy cells.</p>
    <p>That poses a risk to fu­ture Covid-19 vac­cines, which are based on dis­abling the spike pro­tein, the in­sti­tute said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ian Jones, a vi­rol­ogy pro­fes­sor from Bri­tain’s Univer­sity of Read­ing, said the virus would be ex­pected to mu­tate in a new species.</p>
    <p>“It must adapt to be able to use mink re­cep­tors to en­ter cells and so will mod­ify the spike pro­tein to en­able this to hap­pen ef­fi­ciently,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“The dan­ger is that the mu­tated virus could then spread back into man and evade any vac­cine re­sponse which would have been de­signed to the orig­i­nal, non-mu­tated ver­sion of the spike pro­tein, and not the mink-adapted ver­sion.”</p>
    <p>Dr James Wood, a pro­fes­sor of vet­eri­nary medicine from Cam­bridge Univer­sity, cau­tioned that the true im­pli­ca­tion of the changes</p>
    <p>The dan­ger is that the mu­tated virus could then spread back into man and evade any vac­cine re­sponse which would have been de­signed to the orig­i­nal, non-mu­tated ver­sion of the spike pro­tein, and not the mink-adapted ver­sion.</p>
    <p>in the spike pro­tein had not yet been fully as­sessed by sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>“It is too early to say that the change will cause ei­ther vac­cines or im­mu­nity to fail,” he said.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) said yes­ter­day it is now look­ing at biose­cu­rity around mink farms across the world to pre­vent fur­ther “spillover events”.</p>
    <p>Dr Maria van Kerkhove, the WHO’s tech­ni­cal lead for Covid-19, told a brief­ing in Geneva yes­ter­day that trans­mis­sion of the virus be­tween an­i­mals and hu­mans was “a con­cern”, but added: “Mu­ta­tions (in viruses) are nor­mal. These type of changes in the virus are some­thing we have been track­ing since the be­gin­ning.”</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing with re­gional of­fices... where there are mink farms, and look­ing at biose­cu­rity and to pre­vent spillover events,” Dr van Kerkhove said.</p>
    <p>She said Den­mark’s de­ci­sion to cull its minks was aimed at pre­vent­ing the es­tab­lish­ment of “a new an­i­mal reser­voir for this virus”.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said it is re­mov­ing Den­mark from the gov­ern­ment’s travel cor­ri­dor list. Peo­ple ar­riv­ing in Bri­tain from Den­mark now need to self-iso­late.</p>
    <p>“Pas­sen­gers ar­riv­ing into the UK from Den­mark from 4am on Fri­day 6 Novem­ber 2020 will need to self-iso­late for 14 days by law be­fore fol­low­ing do­mes­tic re­stric­tions now in force,” Bri­tish Trans­port Sec­re­tary Grant Shapps said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain also re­moved Swe­den and Ger­many from its travel cor­ri­dor on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>DR IAN JONES, a vi­rol­ogy pro­fes­sor from Bri­tain’s Univer­sity of Read­ing, on on the pos­si­ble con­se­quences.</p>
