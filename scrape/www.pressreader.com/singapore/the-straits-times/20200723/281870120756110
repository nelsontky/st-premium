    <p>MINSK • Dis­missed by the in­cum­bent as too frag­ile to run Be­larus be­cause of their gen­der, three women have joined forces to try to un­seat Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko, a man the United States once called Europe’s last dic­ta­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the coun­try for over a quar­ter of a cen­tury, has tried to snuff out rare and sus­tained protests against him ahead of a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion next month, jail­ing ri­vals and ar­rest­ing dis­senters.</p>
    <p>He faces his big­gest chal­lenge in years due to frus­tra­tion over his hands-off han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and griev­ances over the econ­omy and hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>With his male chal­lengers ei­ther barred from run­ning or in pri­son, two of the chal­lengers’ wives and a fe­male cam­paign team mem­ber of an­other have united to try to beat him in the Aug 9 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Svet­lana Tikhanousk­aya, whose hus­band, Syarhei, spent time in soli­tary con­fine­ment, has be­come the sur­prise lead­ing chal­lenger to Mr Lukashenko, a 65-year-old former Soviet col­lec­tive farm boss.</p>
    <p>Ms Tikhanousk­aya launched her can­di­dacy after her hus­band, a pop­u­lar blog­ger who cam­paigned against Mr Lukashenko, was ar­rested in May on what she says were trumped-up charges.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko is ex­pected to ex­tend his grip on power de­spite the chal­lenge. West­ern ob­servers do not judge elec­tions in the coun­try to be free and fair.</p>
    <p>As a can­di­date, Ms Tikhanousk­aya’s first pri­or­ity is to free all po­lit­i­cal pris­on­ers and re­run the elec­tions to in­clude all can­di­dates who were barred from stand­ing. By Sun­day, she was stand­ing on stage hav­ing amassed the largest op­po­si­tion elec­tion rally Be­larus has seen in decades.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple of Be­larus “do not want to live in mis­ery any more, they want to live in a free coun­try where they do not grab peo­ple in the street, put them into a po­lice van and then send them to jail for an in­vented rea­son”, she said.</p>
    <p>Her chal­lenge is be­ing sup­ported by two other women – Ms Maria Kolesnikov­a, a mem­ber of the cam­paign team for Mr Vik­tor Babariko, who was de­tained and ac­cused of fi­nan­cial mis­deeds, and Ms Veronika Tsep­kalo, wife of Mr Valery Tsep­kalo, a former am­bas­sador to the US who was barred from stand­ing after the cen­tral elec­tion com­mis­sion dis­al­lowed some of the sig­na­tures he needed to col­lect to be­come a can­di­date.</p>
    <p>An im­age of the three women pos­ing for the cam­era – Ms Tikhanousk­aya clench­ing her fist, Ms Kolesnikov­a mak­ing a heart sign, and Ms Tsep­kalo mak­ing a “V” for vic­tory sign – has spread quickly. They at­tend events to­gether, and peo­ple ask them for self­ies in the street, spark­ing jokes that they re­sem­ble a fe­male rock band.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko has said he re­spects women but that “so­ci­ety is not ma­ture enough to vote for a woman”.</p>
    <p>The bur­den of the pres­i­dency would cause her to “col­lapse, poor thing”, he said.</p>
    <p>After re­ceiv­ing an anony­mous threat that her chil­dren would be taken away if she pressed on with her cam­paign, Ms Tikhanousk­aya has sent them abroad to an undis­closed lo­ca­tion.</p>
