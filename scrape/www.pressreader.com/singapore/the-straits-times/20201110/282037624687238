    <p>As part of Tuas Ter­mi­nal’s constructi­on, work­ers from Hyundai En­gi­neer­ing and Constructi­on had to spray a coat­ing agent on the ex­posed sur­faces of a sub­merged con­crete unit while sus­pended in the air.</p>
    <p>That ended when a team from the firm de­signed and built an un­manned sprayer, con­trolled by work­ers on the ground, to ap­ply the coat­ing in­stead, elim­i­nat­ing the risk of work­ing at a height for the work­ers.</p>
    <p>For their ef­forts, Hyundai En­gi­neer­ing and Constructi­on re­ceived an in­no­va­tion award at the an­nual Work­place Safety and Health (WSH) Awards, or­gan­ised by the WSH Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 190 com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als re­ceived awards this year in var­i­ous cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing WSH of­fi­cers and work­place su­per­vi­sors.</p>
    <p>In­stead of the usual pre­sen­ta­tion cer­e­mony for all win­ners, a scaled-down event was held yes­ter­day be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic. Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo and Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad pre­sented tro­phies to seven ex­cel­lence and gold award win­ners from the per­for­mance awards cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>A com­mem­o­ra­tive e-book was also launched to mark the oc­ca­sion this year. It doc­u­ments ef­forts by some of the award win­ners to en­sure that their work­ers have safe and healthy work­ing en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>In a recorded speech that was part of the e-book, Mrs Teo high­lighted the im­por­tance of safe man­age­ment mea­sures amid the pan­demic, and said the un­cer­tain­ties and busi­ness dis­rup­tions brought about by the pan­demic should not stop firms from keep­ing up good WSH stan­dards. She also en­cour­aged com­pa­nies to look for ways to ap­ply the WSH 2028 health, own­er­ship and tech­nol­ogy strate­gies to i mprove their WSH per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The 10-year WSH 2028 cam­paign was launched last year in a bid to make Sin­ga­pore among the safest work­places in the world by 2028, with a fa­tal in­jury rate of less than 1.0 per 100,000 work­ers.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing Hyundai’s ex­am­ple, Mrs Teo said the un­manned sprayer de­vice re­duced project work time by more than 50 per cent and helped the com­pany save $2.5 mil­lion. “This is a good ex­am­ple of how good WSH prac­tices make busi­ness sense as well,” she said.</p>
