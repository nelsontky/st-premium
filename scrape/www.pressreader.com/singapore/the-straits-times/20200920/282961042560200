    <p>Editorial</p>
    <p>The Yomi­uri Shim­bun, Ja­pan</p>
    <p>Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga won the Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) pres­i­den­tial elec­tion and will lead a new Cabi­net. It is hoped that he will ex­er­cise his lead­er­ship skills to solve a moun­tain of prob­lems, in­clud­ing deal­ing with an in­fec­tious dis­ease.</p>
    <p>This is ef­fec­tively the first time since the party was formed that an LDP law­maker not be­long­ing to any party fac­tion has been elected its pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Since Mr Shinzo Abe re­signed as party chief in the mid­dle of his term, Mr Suga will serve only one year in of­fice, un­til Septem­ber next year. The terms of the cur­rent House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives mem­bers will ex­pire in Oc­to­ber next year. Some have said that Mr Suga needs to dis­solve the Lower House early for a gen­eral elec­tion in or­der to build a full-fledged ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The key is to main­tain a stable po­lit­i­cal sys­tem. Ex­pec­ta­tions are high for Mr Suga, who has been at the cen­tre of the Cabi­net sup­port­ing Mr Abe’s ad­min­is­tra­tion for a long time.</p>
    <p>But lead­ing a coun­try in­volves a heavy re­spon­si­bil­ity. In car­ry­ing out his poli­cies, it is not enough to sim­ply call for pol­icy con­ti­nu­ity.</p>
    <p>His abil­ity to ac­cu­rately un­der­stand changes in global af­fairs and strate­gi­cally re­spond to them will be tested.</p>
    <p>It is also es­sen­tial to ad­dress so­cial se­cu­rity re­form and fis­cal re­con­struc­tion from a medium to long-term per­spec­tive. Dur­ing his elec­tion cam­paign, Mr Suga showed his will­ing­ness to re­or­gan­ise re­gional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and lower mo­bile phone fees. He must steadily re­alise th­ese mat­ters and pro­duce re­sults.</p>
    <p>The Abe ad­min­is­tra­tion lagged in its re­sponses to the coro­n­avirus out­break. Mr Suga is partly re­spon­si­ble for this.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­tics has a ma­jor role to play in bring­ing peace of mind to so­ci­ety. Mr Suga must work to dis­pel the con­cerns of the peo­ple by ex­pand­ing tests for the coro­n­avirus and strength­en­ing the med­i­cal sys­tem. me­dia part­ner Asia News Net­work, a group­ing of 24 news me­dia ti­tles.</p>
