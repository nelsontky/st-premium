    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Mr Joe Bi­den’s cam­paign en­tered this month with a war chest that was al­most three times larger than United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s, so­lid­i­fy­ing the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee’s ad­van­tage in the fi­nal weeks of the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Lat­est fil­ings with the Fed­eral Elec­tion Com­mis­sion show Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign had US$177.3 million (S$240 million) in the bank at the end of last month.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, Mr Trump burned through al­most half his cash in Septem­ber, end­ing the month with US$63.1 million, even though he cut ex­penses by pulling back on planned ad­ver­tis­ing buys start­ing in late Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Af­ter en­joy­ing a fi­nan­cial edge for much of the race, Mr Trump is be­ing forced to play catch-up in fund-raising at the same time he re­mains con­sis­tently be­hind Mr Bi­den in na­tional sur­veys.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is now down 8.6 per­cent­age points in the RealClearP­ol­i­tics polling av­er­age and be­hind, but by nar­rower mar­gins, in key bat­tle­ground states just two weeks be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The fil­ings show Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign raised US$281.6 million last month while spend­ing US$285 million, more than twice as much as Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign raised US$83.1 million in Septem­ber while spend­ing US$139.3 million, the fil­ings show.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s broader re-elec­tion ef­fort, which in­cludes the Re­pub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee and two joint fund-raising com­mit­tees, raised US$247.8 million last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and the Demo­cratic Na­tional Com­mit­tee (DNC) raised US$383 million in the month and said they have US$432 million i n the bank, against US$251.6 million for Mr Trump’s elec­tion com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and the DNC raised US$748 million in Au­gust and Septem­ber alone, about US$290 million more than Mr Trump over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic nom­i­nee’s cam­paign said last Fri­day that it is on track to raise another US$234 million be­fore Nov 3.</p>
    <p>If the es­ti­mate holds true, Mr Bi­den and the DNC would have raised more than US$982 million in the fi­nal three months be­fore the elec­tion, sur­pass­ing the US$942 million that for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama took in for his 2008 cam­paign.</p>
    <p>It is a huge turn­around for Mr Bi­den and the DNC. In April, they had just US$98 million in the bank, against US$255 million for Mr Trump’s re-elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>The ex­tra money has al­lowed Mr Bi­den to dom­i­nate the air­waves in the fi­nal weeks of the race.</p>
