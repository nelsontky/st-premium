    <p>Car­ry­ing small logs and branches that they have found, Ethan Seow, 12, and his eight-year-old brother, Ean, are build­ing a fire to cook pasta out­doors.</p>
    <p>The out­ing last month to Pu­lau Ubin, or­gan­ised by travel agency Be­yond Ex­pe­di­tions, was a chance for the boys and their par­ents to learn out­door sur­vival skills, which are at­tract­ing more in­ter­est in Sin­ga­pore in th­ese volatile times.</p>
    <p>The boys’ mother, Ms Gina Pang, 44, says: “It’s some­thing new and I’m al­ways look­ing for ad­ven­tur­ous stuff for them to try.”</p>
    <p>Ms Pang, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions firm Res­o­lute Com­mu­ni­ca­tions, has gone to places like Mount Kil­i­man­jaro in Tan­za­nia and Viet­nam’s Son Doong Cave, the world’s largest cave. Two years ago, her fam­ily of four vis­ited Mon­go­lia, ex­pe­ri­enc­ing mi­nus 40 deg C weather, rein­deer herd­ing and dog sled­ding.</p>
    <p>Be­sides slak­ing the thirst of ad­ven­ture trav­ellers un­able to head over­seas due to Covid-19, the draw of wilder­ness train­ing lies partly in its ap­peal to self-re­liance amid the so­ci­etal upheaval wrought by the pan­demic, in­dus­try in­sid­ers say.</p>
    <p>A niche mar­ket in highly ur­banised Sin­ga­pore, there are sev­eral out­door sur­vival skills pro­grammes avail­able for adults and chil­dren. With prices that typ­i­cally start at $200, par­tic­i­pants range in age from pre-school­ers to 60-yearolds.</p>
    <p>Bushcraft skills in­clude mak­ing a fire, build­ing a wa­ter­proof shel­ter from scratch, read­ing com­passes and know­ing what to do when a crocodile is in the vicin­ity (Short an­swer: Stay calm and step away).</p>
    <p>Due to Covid-19, out­door camp­ing is not al­lowed across Sin­ga­pore and camp­fires are per­mit­ted only within des­ig­nated camp­fire pits on Pu­lau Ubin and at Pasir Ris Park. Only twigs and other pieces of wood found on the ground can be used for such fires.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 re­stric­tions not­with­stand­ing, Mr Glen Poh, 31, has seen a 30 per cent uptick in in­quiries and sign-ups for the wilder­ness sur­vival cour­ses he of­fers, com­pared with last year, be­fore the pan­demic broke out.</p>
    <p>Wilder­ness sur­vival train­ing is now the most pop­u­lar ser­vice at his com­pany, Train­ing By Glen (www.train­ing­by­glen.com). They start at $200 a head for a four-hour “crash course”. Pre­vi­ously, other cour­ses like park­our and swim­ming were more hotly sub­scribed.</p>
    <p>Mr Poh says the desta­bil­is­ing un­cer­tainty thrown up by the pan­demic en­hances the ap­peal of re­ly­ing on one­self and be­ing less de­pen­dent on so­ci­ety at large.</p>
    <p>“Par­tic­i­pants have told me they want to learn sur­vival skills to feel self-reliant. It’s about be­ing more con­fi­dent on re­ly­ing on your­self for things like find­ing wa­ter or build­ing a shel­ter to pro­tect your­self from the el­e­ments – even if you don’t need to,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Mr Poh, who is also a fit­ness in­struc­tor, learnt out­door sur­vival skills camp­ing in the wilder­ness in coun­tries like Green­land, Zam­bia and Malaysia, where he also trained with lo­cal bushcraft prac­ti­tion­ers. He has trained par­tic­i­pants from about age 18 to 60.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 left Mr Scott Tay, di­rec­tor of travel firm Be­yond Ex­pe­di­tions (www.face­book.com/be­yond ex­pe­di­tion­ssg), un­able to or­gan­ise over­seas trips to places like Mon­go­lia and Kaza­khstan.</p>
    <p>It made him re­think the con­cept of ad­ven­ture travel, where lo­cal guides of­ten set up camp and pre­pare food for tourists in re­mote lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 got me re­flect­ing more deeply on what ad­ven­ture travel means, if par­tic­i­pants can’t start a fire or set up a tent. It’s a good op­por­tu­nity to pre­pare peo­ple with ba­sic sur­vival skills for fu­ture travel,” says Mr Tay, 28.</p>
    <p>His com­pany did a soft launch of­fer­ing out­door sur­vival skills ses­sions early last month, which start at $250 a head.</p>
    <p>Be­sides mak­ing a camp­fire and cook­ing dishes like aglio olio pasta, dhal and masala tea al fresco, op­tions such as learn­ing wood­carv­ing are avail­able. Be­yond Ex­pe­di­tions also of­fers lo­cal tours to ex­plore aban­doned bunkers.</p>
    <p>At Out­door School Sin­ga­pore (out­doorschool.sg) by Seed In­sti­tute, which of­fers hol­i­day pro­grammes fo­cus­ing on out­door sur­vival skills for chil­dren aged five to nine, it is not just about teach­ing kids to tie knots and ropes to build a for­est shel­ter.</p>
    <p>Bushcraft train­ing also teaches life skills like risk man­age­ment and team­work, says Ms Ann Phang, its pro­gramme ar­chi­tect.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion saw a 60 per cent in­crease in par­tic­i­pa­tion for its hol­i­day pro­gramme in Septem­ber, com­pared with its pro­gramme in March, be­fore the cir­cuit breaker took ef­fect. Its year-end pro­grammes cost $300.</p>
    <p>Bi­ol­ogy teacher Robin Seoh’s son, Kel­don, has at­tended a few hol­i­day cour­ses by Out­door School Sin­ga­pore. Mr Seoh, who is mar­ried to a 38-year-old fi­nance man­ager, also has a 12-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Be­sides keep­ing his eight-yearold son oc­cu­pied at a time when bor­ders are closed, Mr Seoh, 44, says the cour­ses have “opened up doors in tiny ways” for Kel­don.</p>
    <p>He has a deeper ap­pre­ci­a­tion of na­ture now and was re­cently able to iden­tify the Sim­por Air plant, whose large leaves can be used to wrap food, dur­ing a walk.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the Pri­mary 2 pupil, who learnt knot-ty­ing with Out­door School Sin­ga­pore, was able to switch al­most im­me­di­ately from shoes with Vel­cro fas­ten­ers to those with laces too.</p>
