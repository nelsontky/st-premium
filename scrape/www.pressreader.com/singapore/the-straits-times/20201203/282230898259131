    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain’s re­tail in­dus­try suf­fered one of the harsh­est blows yet af­ter two of the coun­try’s best­known re­tail­ers col­lapsed, putting 25,000 jobs at risk in less than 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Deben­hams said on Tues­day morn­ing that it is pre­par­ing to close its doors for good af­ter fail­ing to find a buyer. Late on Mon­day, Philip Green’s Ar­ca­dia Group, which owns brands in­clud­ing Top­shop and Dorothy Perkins, be­gan in­sol­vency pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Both re­tail­ers have an­chored malls and main streets across Bri­tain for decades and op­er­ate about 600 stores com­bined.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish re­tail­ers have suf­fered a dou­ble whammy: The pan­demic hit as many were strug­gling to ad­just to on­line com­pe­ti­tion. The in­dus­try is set to lose 235,000 re­tail jobs this year, ac­cord­ing to the Cen­tre for Re­tail Re­search.</p>
    <p>The fail­ure of Ar­ca­dia and Deben­hams is “truly dev­as­tat­ing” in a coun­try where main streets are be­ing in­creas­ingly hol­lowed out, said Mr Richard Lim, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Re­tail Eco­nomics, a con­sul­tancy.</p>
    <p>“We can­not over­state the sig­nif­i­cance of the col­lapse given the vast prop­erty port­fo­lio, num­ber of jobs im­pacted and the re­ver­ber­a­tions felt across the in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment stands ready to sup­port em­ploy­ees of both re­tail­ers, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Rishi Su­nak said in the House of Com­mons on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Deben­hams, a 232-year-old Bri­tish de­part­ment store chain, has been strug­gling for years as con­sumers shifted to on­line shop­ping and store vis­its de­clined. In</p>
    <p>April, the com­pany filed to con­tinue op­er­at­ing un­der ad­min­is­tra­tion while seek­ing a buyer.</p>
    <p>The chain de­cided to wind up the busi­ness on Tues­day af­ter talks to sell the busi­ness to JD Sports Fash­ion failed. Ar­ca­dia is the big­gest con­ces­sion part­ner of Deben­hams, and af­ter that re­tailer failed, the sports­wear re­tailer said the pur­chase was no longer ap­peal­ing.</p>
    <p>Deben­hams said it had no choice but to start wind­ing down the busi­ness, given the pro­longed ef­fects of the pan­demic. It is still open for of­fers for all or parts of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion is a blow to Deben­hams’ lenders, a con­sor­tium of fi­nan­cial in­vestors in­clud­ing Sil­ver Point Cap­i­tal and Gold­enTree As­set Man­age­ment, which took con­trol of the chain last year as it strug­gled un­der a £720 mil­lion (S$1.3 bil­lion) debt load. At the time, the com­pany re­jected res­cue of­fers from re­tail ty­coon Mike Ash­ley, the founder of Frasers Group.</p>
    <p>Mr Ash­ley may now re­turn once again as a suitor as Deben­hams is liq­ui­dated. He ac­quired ri­val re­tailer House of Fraser out of ad­min­is­tra­tion in 2018. The ty­coon has also ex­pressed in­ter­est in buy­ing Ar­ca­dia.</p>
    <p>Ar­ca­dia has ap­pointed Deloitte to run the ad­min­is­tra­tion and the con­sul­tancy now has eight weeks to draw up ini­tial pro­pos­als for the busi­ness, which could in­clude a sale of all or part of the group. No job losses have been an­nounced yet but they are likely to start mount­ing in the com­ing weeks as un­prof­itable stores are closed.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness em­ploys 13,000 peo­ple across 466 stores, of which 444 are in the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>Ar­ca­dia’s per­for­mance suf­fered from the nim­bler growth of on­line ri­vals, such as Asos and Boohoo, and a heavy cost bur­den, bogged down by ex­pen­sive store rents and prop­erty taxes.</p>
    <p>Cred­i­tors to Ar­ca­dia will now be lin­ing up to get re­paid from as­set sales if no buyer or new fi­nanc­ing emerges. Among them, the com­pany has a £310 mil­lion loan with Apollo Global Man­age­ment se­cured on its flagship store in Ox­ford Street.</p>
    <p>The sub­sidiary that owns that prop­erty has hired KPMG as ad­min­is­tra­tors to as­sess op­tions for the 100,000 sq ft site, which used to wel­come 400,000 cus­tomers a week be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Another li­a­bil­ity is Ar­ca­dia’s pen­sion plans, which the com­pany agreed to pro­vide se­cu­rity for last year to the value of £210 mil­lion. The Unite union has warned that em­ploy­ees may lose their pen­sions as a re­sult of the ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The fail­ure of Ar­ca­dia and Deben­hams is “truly dev­as­tat­ing” in a coun­try where main streets are be­ing in­creas­ingly hol­lowed out, said Mr Richard Lim, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Re­tail Eco­nomics, a con­sul­tancy.</p>
