    <p>A spare shilling in your pocket in May 1906 would have got you into London’s hit at­trac­tion that sea­son: an ex­hi­bi­tion hall filled with hag­gard “home work­ers” bent over their trades.</p>
    <p>Plac­ards next to each per­son ex­plained to on­look­ers their hours, their pay and a few bi­o­graph­i­cal de­tails. No. 15, for in­stance, made bon­nets to sup­port her­self and “two weakly chil­dren” after she “lost her hus­band in a very trag­i­cal man­ner”.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion was or­gan­ised to high­light the plight of “sweated work­ers”: Fac­to­ries would sub­di­vide work and par­cel it out via mid­dle­men to peo­ple (often women) work­ing at home for miserly piece rates.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home is no longer usu­ally as­so­ci­ated with poverty and des­per­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In fact, as this year’s pan­demic has un­der­lined, to “WFH” in 2020 is a priv­i­lege con­fined mostly to the well paid. Euro­pean data sug­gests three-quar­ters of jobs in the high­est-pay­ing quin­tile can be done re­motely, com­pared with just 3 per cent of those in the low­est quin­tile.</p>
    <p>But there is a seem­ingly fu­tur­is­tic way to earn money from home with­out a pro­fes­sional job. It’s called crowd-work and peo­ple are flock­ing to it be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Strip away the 21st-cen­tury gloss, and it wouldn’t look out of place in that ex­hi­bi­tion hall.</p>
    <p>Crowd-work plat­forms en­able com­pa­nies to split vir­tual jobs into small tasks, then of­fer them to home work­ers to com­plete any­where in the world.</p>
    <p>Like Uber driv­ers and other gig econ­omy par­tic­i­pants, crowd-work­ers are classed as in­de­pen­dent con­trac­tors and paid by the task. But they are vir­tu­ally in­vis­i­ble and no one knows how many there are.</p>
    <p>Janey, from a small for­mer min­ing town in the United States, be­came a crowd-worker after the fa­ther of their three chil­dren died of an opi­oid over­dose. “If I work 12 to 16 hours a day, I’ll make maybe US$5 (S$6.80) an hour,” she said in an in­ter­view in a re­search pa­per by Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia Hast­ings law school pro­fes­sor Veena Dubal.</p>
    <p>Janey works on crowd-work site Ama­zon Me­chan­i­cal Turk (AMT), where there is no min­i­mum wage and many “re­questers” pay only a cent or two per task.</p>
    <p>“There are so many of us now and fewer qual­ity jobs. Some­times I wake up in the mid­dle of the night just to see if I can grab some good re­quests.”</p>
    <p>The “good re­quests” are avail­able only to work­ers who have al­ready com­pleted a vast num­ber of tasks and who main­tain a high ac­cep­tance rate. If your work is re­jected (fairly or un­fairly), you don’t get paid.</p>
    <p>Many tasks in­volve clean­ing or la­belling data for com­pa­nies de­vel­op­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence. Aca­demics also use crowd plat­forms to re­cruit par­tic­i­pants cheaply and quickly for sur­veys.</p>
    <p>In 2017, re­searchers recorded 2,676 work­ers per­form­ing</p>
    <p>3.8 mil­lion tasks on AMT, and found the me­dian hourly wage was US$2 an hour. Only 4 per cent earned more than US$7.25 an hour.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion is global: Work­ers in the US earn US$3.01 per hour on av­er­age, while those in In­dia earn US$1.41. Pro­lific, a</p>
    <p>United King­dom-based crowd-work plat­form for sur­veys and mar­ket re­search, im­poses an hourly pay floor by cal­cu­lat­ing the av­er­age time it takes work­ers to com­plete each task.</p>
    <p>But while the UK’s le­gal min­i­mum wage for over-25s is £8.72 (S$15.30) an hour, Pro­lific’s is £5 an hour.</p>
    <p>Why do peo­ple do it? Just as with the home work­ers at the turn of the 20th cen­tury, some dab­ble for pocket money to fill their spare hours, while oth­ers de­pend on it be­cause they live in an em­ploy­ment black spot, have dis­abil­i­ties, want to stay at home with their chil­dren or can­not af­ford child­care.</p>
    <p>This year, the pan­demic has cre­ated the per­fect con­di­tions for huge growth in crowd-work: There is mass unem­ploy­ment, a short­age of child­care and a higher risk of dy­ing of Covid-19 if you do a more tra­di­tional low-paid job such as so­cial care.</p>
    <p>“You de­serve to be safe too,” urged a re­cent ad­vert for Arise, a vir­tual call cen­tre plat­form where peo­ple have to pay for their own equip­ment and train­ing, and can then work from home.</p>
    <p>As his­to­rian He­len McCarthy de­tails in her book Dou­ble Lives, some Ed­war­dian re­formists wanted to drive home work into fac­to­ries and “set (women) free for do­mes­tic du­ties”. In the US, some types of home work were banned al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Pa­tro­n­is­ing pa­ter­nal­ism would be the wrong re­sponse to­day. Peo­ple are choos­ing to work on these plat­forms be­cause they want, or need, to work from home.</p>
    <p>If only the rich are to be al­lowed that priv­i­lege, it will open an­other fault line in a di­vided so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>But that doesn’t mean the op­por­tunis­ti­cally low rates of pay, opac­ity and pow­er­less­ness built into these plat­forms should be al­lowed to con­tinue unchecked.</p>
    <p>Im­prove­ments will re­quire reg­u­la­tion, union­i­sa­tion and, in coun­tries like the US, a bet­ter so­cial safety net so peo­ple are less des­per­ate.</p>
    <p>Ger­man crowd-work­ers rely less on the plat­forms than US ones, a dif­fer­ence re­searchers at­tribute to Ger­many’s su­pe­rior so­cial pro­tec­tions. In July, one in five Amer­i­cans with chil­dren at home couldn’t af­ford to feed them enough, ac­cord­ing to cen­sus data.</p>
    <p>For many, work­ing from home now feels like the fu­ture. But if we aren’t care­ful, for some, it will mean a re­turn to the past – one that our fore­bears fought hard to leave be­hind.</p>
