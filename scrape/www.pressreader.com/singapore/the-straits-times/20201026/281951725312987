    <p>It started with my spice cab­i­net. I’d been in a quar­an­tine cook­ing rut, and while search­ing on­line for dif­fer­ent things to do with the var­i­ous jars and tins at my dis­posal, I found my­self on the Wikipedia page for Sichuan pepper.</p>
    <p>Not a shocker. Wikipedia is fre­quently the first or sec­ond re­sult of a Google search.</p>
    <p>Plenty has been writ­ten about the rise of anti-in­tel­lec­tu­al­ism, but the world­wide pop­u­lar­ity of Wikipedia re­veals that most of us still itch to know things.</p>
    <p>But what could I learn from the Sichuan pepper en­try? It was lit­tered with the note “ci­ta­tion needed”, and the en­tire sec­tion on names was flagged as mis­lead­ing.</p>
    <p>I was an­noyed, ex­ces­sively so. It wasn’t that I needed to know the sci­en­tific names and lo­cal­i­ties for ev­ery va­ri­ety of Sichuan pepper. I had a jar of red pep­per­corns al­ready. The er­ror-rid­den en­try did not in­con­ve­nience me, but it both­ered me just the same. It both­ered me to see bad re­search.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, way­lay­ing bad re­search was my job. I worked as a ref­er­ence li­brar­ian, which meant that on any given day, I might help some­one un­cover what business their an­ces­tor was in, the story be­hind the name of a neigh­bour­hood park or the re­la­tion­ship between two his­tor­i­cal fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers ar­rived with their own hopes and hy­pothe­ses, which the truth of­ten wiped out. (“I’m sorry, sir, but it ap­pears that your great-grand­fa­ther was not a cos­mopoli­tan golf pro. He was a mail­man.”) Many re­searchers left dis­ap­pointed – in their fam­i­lies or their he­roes or the nature of the world.</p>
    <p>But more of­ten than not, weeks or months later, an e-mail would chime through: They had con­tin­ued along the path we had un­cov­ered to­gether and needed more help. The truth is not al­ways what we want it to be, yet it re­mains com­pelling, by nature of be­ing true.</p>
    <p>I loved my job. But in li­braries, as in so many fields, ca­reers have been shaken up again and again by the pan­demic, like a high-stakes game of Bog­gle. I was laid off, then un-laid off, thanks to a Pay­check Pro­tec­tion Pro­gramme loan. My job de­scrip­tion changed be­cause we could not re­trieve archival ma­te­rial when work­ing from home. Grant fund­ing did not come through and I lost my job again. I had a baby, a dog and seven open browser tabs of medi­ocre job de­scrip­tions, so I had plenty to keep me busy. But I did not feel use­ful, not in the way I had been.</p>
    <p>This feel­ing of use­less­ness was ex­ac­er­bated by the fact that we were com­ing up on an elec­tion. Peo­ple were scram­bling for some truth to cling onto in a sea of hasty, sloppy, some­times de­lib­er­ately mis­lead­ing re­search. The cra­zier the world gets, the more it needs li­brar­i­ans – I re­ally be­lieve that – but I seemed to have lost my pow­ers when I lost my job.</p>
    <p>What good would it do to pedan­ti­cally of­fer sources as the 300th com­men­ta­tor on some dumb ar­ti­cle about Q Anon? I tried any­way, cring­ing in an­tic­i­pa­tion of blow­back, but no­body even no­ticed.</p>
    <p>Then, while read­ing lazy half-truths about Sichuan pepper at my kitchen counter, it was as if I re­ceived some li­brar­ian ver­sion of the bat sig­nal, a sin­gle round pep­per­corn out­lined against the night sky.</p>
    <p>Here, I was needed. Here, I could do some­thing. It was easy to be­gin. The bar­rier to en­try for edit­ing Wikipedia is low, and I al­ready had a Wikipedia ac­count. I hadn’t done much with it beyond cre­at­ing a short en­try for the South Ox­ford Ten­nis Club, which was at one time the only black-owned ten­nis club in New York City.</p>
    <p>“Why doesn’t any­one know about this?” a li­brary pa­tron had asked me af­ter we stum­bled across an ar­ti­cle about it. I’ve heard this ques­tion so many times! Yet clearly peo­ple do know about these things – they write the ar­ti­cles and books in which we make our dis­cov­er­ies. I think what peo­ple re­ally mean when they say, “Why doesn’t any­one know about this?” is “Why isn’t this in­for­ma­tion su­per easy to find?” or more suc­cinctly, “Why isn’t this on Wikipedia?”</p>
    <p>So that’s how I put in the South Ox­ford Ten­nis Club en­try. And it was so much work, even beyond the re­search and for­mat­ting: Is my phras­ing too opin­ion­ated? Do I trust a scholar’s word over a source that claims to have been there? To that point, what is my role as a non-black per­son start­ing a record of a black in­sti­tu­tion?</p>
    <p>I was re­minded of all this as I shook the dust off my ac­count to edit Sichuan pepper. The ef­fort of Wikipedia had been a headache when I had a full-time job, but now I could bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate how ex­tra­or­di­nary it is that such de­tailed con­cerns should be stan­dard on a vol­un­teer pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery sin­gle en­try – from “99 Bot­tles of Beer” to “Hu­man” – has an ac­com­pa­ny­ing “Talk” page, where ed­i­tors and readers dis­sect it. In the past I’ve had to re­mind stu­dent pa­trons that you can’t cite Wikipedia on re­search pa­pers, and if they asked why, I never had a great an­swer, just some­thing along the lines of, “Um, it’s kind of lazy, don’t you think?”</p>
    <p>But now I’d ad­vise them to visit a Talk page or two to un­der­stand what re­search is. It’s not just look­ing on­line for stuff; it’s a process of as­sess­ment, of re­search­ing through what you’ve found to de­ter­mine what’s su­per­flu­ous, what’s miss­ing and what re­quires thought. The naked­ness of this process on Talk pages makes it ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional re­searchers can be pre­cious about our work, but re­search is a skill we can and should all ac­quire, given the abun­dance of in­for­ma­tion and mis­in­for­ma­tion mixed up at our fin­ger­tips. Plus, it feels great.</p>
    <p>Few things are as sat­is­fy­ing as un­cov­er­ing a hard gem of truth in the shift­ing sands of opin­ion, pol­i­tics and leg­end. I worked my way slowly through the Sichuan pepper en­try, un­rav­el­ling the truth of an as­ser­tion while wait­ing to hear back on job ap­pli­ca­tions, adding a ci­ta­tion while my baby slept.</p>
    <p>As some­one who’s never lived in China and does not speak Man­darin, I was es­pe­cially con­cerned with find­ing sources from re­gional ex­perts. Sichuan pepper, like the South Ox­ford Ten­nis Club, be­longs to a cul­ture dif­fer­ent from the one I grew up in, and qual­ity re­search re­quires pri­mary sources – peo­ple who know what they’re talk­ing about be­cause they’ve lived it.</p>
    <p>In al­most ev­ery in­stance, un­cov­er­ing truth means hear­ing the words of peo­ple who aren’t you. I fin­ished the Sichuan pepper re­vi­sions, as much as re­search is ever fin­ished, which is to say that peo­ple are still out there im­prov­ing on my im­prove­ments. But I couldn’t stop. I haven’t stopped. Even as more prof­itable work has come my way, I still find time for an edit on the Bechamel sauce en­try, a ci­ta­tion on the La Llorona en­try, a sleep­less hour ded­i­cated to one of the many, many other en­tries tagged as “Wikipedia ar­ti­cles with sourc­ing is­sues”.</p>
    <p>It’s some­thing of an ad­dic­tion and some­thing of a bene­dic­tion, an act of love for a world that, as messy and mis­lead­ing as it can be, still con­tains the most beau­ti­ful truths.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional re­searchers can be pre­cious about our work, but re­search is a skill we can and should all ac­quire, given the abun­dance of in­for­ma­tion and mis­in­for­ma­tion mixed up at our fin­ger­tips. Plus, it feels great.</p>
    <p>Few things are as sat­is­fy­ing as un­cov­er­ing a hard gem of truth in the shift­ing sands of opin­ion, pol­i­tics and leg­end.</p>
