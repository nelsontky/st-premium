    <p>In­dus­try dis­rup­tions and the Covid-19 pan­demic have cre­ated new chal­lenges that or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als must re­spond to, and the pub­lic ser­vice is no ex­cep­tion, said Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Pub­lic Ser­vice Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic of­fi­cers will need to be flex­i­ble and gain ex­po­sure to di­verse ex­pe­ri­ences, even be­yond the pub­lic sec­tor, to re­spond to un­cer­tain­ties and out­liers, he added.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic ser­vice will also need to adapt its sys­tems for as­sess­ing pub­lic of­fi­cers, Mr Chan said dur­ing the One Pub­lic Ser­vice Ob­ser­vance Cer­e­mony that was held vir­tu­ally for the first time.</p>
    <p>“It is not suf­fi­cient for good of­fi­cers to be posted to dif­fer­ent min­istries or agen­cies but do­ing the same roles,” he said. “It is even more im­por­tant for them to be posted to dif­fer­ent roles.”</p>
    <p>The event is part of the an­nual Pub­lic Ser­vice Week which has been held since 2008 to cel­e­brate and recog­nise the work done by gov­ern­ment of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the need to update the Cur­rently Es­ti­mated Po­ten­tial (CEP) sys­tem, Mr Chan said: “It can­not be, as some of you jok­ingly call it, the ‘Ca­reer End­ing Point’ sys­tem, as if your fate is pre­de­ter­mined and un­chang­ing. In­stead, we must have a sys­tem of con­tin­u­ous mer­i­toc­racy,” he added.</p>
    <p>He told the more than 9,200 pub­lic of­fi­cers who at­tended the cer­e­mony that the ca­reer road map for pub­lic of­fi­cers should be for the next three to five years, not the next 30 years.</p>
    <p>“We will also update how we as­sess high po­ten­tial. To show lead­er­ship po­ten­tial, we must not only be able to make sound poli­cies, we must also be able to im­ple­ment well, in­no­vate, work in teams, com­mu­ni­cate ef­fec­tively and mo­bilise rel­e­vant stake­hold­ers for col­lec­tive ac­tion,” said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“It is not easy or re­al­is­tic to find and de­velop all th­ese at­tributes in</p>
    <p>one sin­gle in­di­vid­ual. This is also why we will be pay­ing greater at­ten­tion to the for­ma­tion of lead­er­ship teams in min­istries and agen­cies. Ul­ti­mately, it is the team that must do</p>
    <p>well for Sin­ga­pore and our or­gan­i­sa­tion, be­yond the in­di­vid­ual do­ing well. We will pro­gres­sively aug­ment the CEP sys­tem with this new ap­proach from 2021.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said se­nior pub­lic ser­vice of­fi­cers should gain ex­po­sure to pol­icy, op­er­a­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions or mo­bil­i­sa­tion work.</p>
    <p>They should also have stints done out­side the pub­lic ser­vice – in the peo­ple and pri­vate sec­tors or over­seas. “The world is be­com­ing more com­plex. We can­not ex­pect to know every­thing if we do not ven­ture out. We can­not preach agility when we do not prac­tise it.</p>
    <p>“We can­not de­velop poli­cies and rules for to­mor­row when we do not know how so­ci­ety and the world op­er­ate be­yond the pub­lic ser­vice,” he pointed out. “We must walk the ground, know our peo­ple, our stake­hold­ers and our busi­nesses even bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als chief ex­ec­u­tive Mayank Parekh said: “The pub­lic ser­vice’s abil­ity to at­tract and re­tain tal­ent and hav­ing an ef­fec­tive tal­ent man­age­ment process is a crit­i­cal suc­cess fac­tor given that it pre­dom­i­nantly looks within to fill lead­er­ship ranks.</p>
    <p>“Re­fresh­ing the ap­proach to lead­er­ship po­ten­tial helps the pub­lic ser­vice re­main rel­e­vant to chang­ing needs and take ad­van­tage of in­no­va­tive tools and prac­tices that are avail­able to­day.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cer­e­mony, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong ad­dressed pub­lic of­fi­cers in a video mes­sage and thanked them for their work dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said: “The Gov­ern­ment’s Covid-19 re­sponse was not per­fect, and there were many things it could have done bet­ter in ret­ro­spect. But over­all, the pub­lic ser­vice more than rose to the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>“This Pub­lic Ser­vice Week, I salute all our pub­lic of­fi­cers for your ded­i­ca­tion and ef­forts. Thank you for what you have done, and con­tinue to do.”</p>
