    <p>Asia wor­ries about China and Amer­ica clash­ing in a hot war, Sin­ga­pore For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan told the Aspen Se­cu­rity Fo­rum yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The big­gest chal­lenges that hu­man­ity faces – pan­demics and cli­mate change, for in­stance – will be transna­tional. Thus deal­ing with them will re­quire co­op­er­a­tion, mul­ti­po­lar lead­er­ship, and mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions and pro­cesses, he told the an­nual event for global lead­ers to dis­cuss for­eign pol­icy and key se­cu­rity is­sues. It is held vir­tu­ally this year.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan said it was un­der­stand­able that Amer­i­can vot­ers would ques­tion the US’ role, call­ing the move a ra­tio­nal po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ment to a change in the world, in­ter­nally and at the global level.</p>
    <p>“At the end of World War II... it made sense for the US to un­der­write the lib­eral world or­der as we know it, which has been a for­mula for peace and pros­per­ity es­pe­cially for demo­cratic South-east Asia.”</p>
    <p>The US’ share of global gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) then was around 40 per cent. “The prob­lem now is that af­ter 1978, China opened up. In 1991, In­dia opened up. And with the fall of the Soviet Union, even Rus­sia and the rest of East­ern Europe came on line. All these ac­tu­ally are pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ments, but what it means is the US now con­sti­tutes maybe about 25 per cent of global GDP,” Dr Balakr­ish­nan said.</p>
    <p>“It is an en­tirely le­git­i­mate ques­tion for the Amer­i­can voter to say, why should the United States have to pay in blood and trea­sure to un­der­write this world or­der?</p>
    <p>“The key point here is we’re mov­ing from a unipo­lar world into a mul­ti­po­lar world.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter added: “What all of us in Asia want is for Amer­ica and China to sort out their strate­gic dif­fer­ences, find a modus vivendi to re­solve these dif­fer­ences, and also to be able to col­lab­o­rate on the mul­ti­lat­eral global chal­lenges that we face – and on that ba­sis to con­tinue to en­gage in Asia, be­cause both Amer­ica and China have huge eq­ui­ties in Asia.”</p>
