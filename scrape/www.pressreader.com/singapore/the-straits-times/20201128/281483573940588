    <p>When Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping came to power in 2012, he made tuo pin, or poverty erad­i­ca­tion, one of his sig­na­ture poli­cies. This week, China de­clared vic­tory in its decades-long bat­tle after the last of its im­pov­er­ished coun­ties were lifted from poverty. While the good news comes just in time for the Com­mu­nist Party’s 100th an­niver­sary next year, some won­der if this suc­cess is sus­tain­able against an eco­nomic slow­down and the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Re­minders to be thank­ful can be seen all over the Cheng­bei Gan En Com­mu­nity, a hous­ing project in Sichuan’s moun­tain­ous Liang­shan Yi Au­ton­o­mous Pre­fec­ture.</p>
    <p>The res­i­den­tial devel­op­ment is aptly named, for “gan en” means grat­i­tude in English.</p>
    <p>“For a happy life, thank the Party”, pro­claims one mu­ral on the side of an apart­ment block. An­other one reads: “Party build­ing guides devel­op­ment”.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers yet quote the oft-cited Chi­nese id­iom, “yin shui si yuan”, mean­ing, when you drink wa­ter, think of its source.</p>
    <p>These ex­hor­ta­tions to be grate­ful to the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) for lift­ing the res­i­dents out of poverty are plas­tered on the walls of ev­ery block in this hous­ing devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The 6,600 res­i­dents of the pre­fec­ture’s Yuexi county who moved to these new gov­ern­ment-built apart­ments from their re­mote vil­lages have much to be thank­ful for.</p>
    <p>Ms Waqi Guo­gemo, 25, is thank­ful that her two chil­dren, aged seven and four, live un­der a proper roof, have ac­cess to health­care and can at­tend school.</p>
    <p>Ms Waqi, who be­longs to the Yi eth­nic mi­nor­ity, used to lead a hard life farm­ing corn and pota­toes. She lived in a mud hut be­fore mov­ing to her new flat a year ago.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think about my old home any more, here my chil­dren can go to school,” Ms Waqi told The Straits Times on a gov­ern­ment-or­gan­ised visit to Liang­shan in Septem­ber, meant to show­case China’s poverty alle­vi­a­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>She said that there was just one gov­ern­ment-run kinder­garten in her vil­lage. Had she re­mained there, her older son would have had to travel to the clos­est town to at­tend ele­men­tary school.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band now makes about 2,000 yuan (S$413) a month as a con­struc­tion worker at the Gan En devel­op­ment. This is one of the many jobs pro­vided by the lo­cal gov­ern­ment to raise in­comes of the poor.</p>
    <p>Ms Waqi and her fam­ily are among mil­lions of poor Chi­nese who have been re­lo­cated to new gov­ern­ment-built homes as part of China’s anti-poverty cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The flats are heav­ily sub­sidised – fam­i­lies pay a one-time charge of 2,500 yuan per head, capped at 10,000 – and are only meant for those the gov­ern­ment deems to be im­pov­er­ished.</p>
    <p>But the ubiq­ui­tous pro­pa­ganda signs also un­der­score the po­lit­i­cally-charged na­ture of such ef­forts.</p>
    <p>In Ms Waqi’s home and in other flats in the es­tate, por­traits of Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping are promi­nently dis­played. In Liang­shan and other ru­ral ar­eas, Mr Xi has be­come the face of China’s poverty alle­vi­a­tion drive.</p>
    <p>THE WAR AGAINST POVERTY</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese Pres­i­dent and the CCP have hitched their le­git­i­macy and cred­i­bil­ity to erad­i­cat­ing ab­so­lute poverty in China. Mr Xi him­self has made nu­mer­ous vis­its to in­spect poverty alle­vi­a­tion ef­forts this year, pledg­ing that no poor in­di­vid­ual, fam­ily or area would be left be­hind.</p>
    <p>And de­spite the chal­lenges posed by the Covid-19 pan­demic and US-China ten­sions, it ap­pears that Mr Xi has suc­ceeded. On Mon­day, Guizhou prov­ince an­nounced that its l ast nine im­pov­er­ished coun­ties had been lifted from poverty. This marks the end of ab­so­lute poverty in the coun­try – at least of­fi­cially.</p>
    <p>When Mr Xi took of­fice in 2012, about 100 mil­lion peo­ple in China were liv­ing in ab­ject poverty.</p>
    <p>Erad­i­cat­ing this be­came a key part of the CCP’s stated goal of build­ing a “mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety” by 2021, the 100th an­niver­sary of the party.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor John Don­ald­son, who has ex­ten­sively re­searched poverty in China, said that while the coun­try has had anti-poverty cam­paigns for decades, no Chi­nese leader be­fore Mr Xi had dis­played such per­sonal at­tach­ment to the ef­fort.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that the ex­ten­sive pro­pa­ganda in poor ru­ral ar­eas shows how the party’s cred­i­bil­ity is linked to the cam­paign’s suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“But it also re­quires that peo­ple iden­tify the party as be­ing the rea­son for suc­cess. It’s not be­cause of lo­cal cadres, or your own hard work, but be­cause of Xi Jin­ping’s ap­proach and poli­cies,” he added.</p>
    <p>The top Chi­nese leader has made erad­i­cat­ing poverty and fight­ing cor­rup­tion his two per­sonal sig­na­ture poli­cies, said Univer­sity of Michi­gan As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Ang Yuen Yuen.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi came to power in 2012, at a time when cor­rup­tion and in­equal­ity were at “cri­sis lev­els”, said Prof Ang.</p>
    <p>“To­gether, (these two poli­cies) con­sti­tute his pop­ulist im­age: propoor, anti-greed. At a time of mount­ing do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional pres­sures, all the more must Xi shore up his po­lit­i­cal sup­port at the base,” said Prof Ang, author of the book How China Es­caped The Poverty Trap.</p>
    <p>DOWN TO THE VIL­LAGES</p>
    <p>With so much on the line, of­fi­cials say they pulled out all the stops to meet poverty tar­gets.</p>
    <p>In Liang­shan, pre­fec­ture party sec­re­tary Lin Shucheng told re­porters in Septem­ber that Covid-19 l ock­downs had pre­vented labour­ers from com­plet­ing the con­struc­tion of new homes for some 40,000 poor fam­i­lies in Bu­tuo county, which had been slated for com­ple­tion by end-June.</p>
    <p>So the pre­fec­ture gov­ern­ment mo­bilised 5,600 work­ers from other work sites in six coun­ties to fin­ish the con­struc­tion in Bu­tuo.</p>
    <p>“By May 30, we had hit our tar­gets,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Liang­shan pre­fec­ture, where many from the Yi eth­nic group live, is criss-crossed by cliffs and val­leys. It is also home to China’s “cliff vil­lage”, a moun­tain vil­lage with­out road ac­cess that has be­come a sym­bol of the dif­fi­culty of the anti-poverty fight.</p>
    <p>The pre­fec­ture was one of the last to ben­e­fit from China’s bat­tle against poverty.</p>
    <p>Some­times, ge­og­ra­phy seems to be des­tiny: Of the 200,000 or so peo­ple in Sichuan prov­ince who were clas­si­fied as im­pov­er­ished at the start of this year, 178,000 resided in the moun­tain­ous re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Lin said the gov­ern­ment has ploughed 115.7 bil­lion yuan into the anti-poverty fight in Liang­shan since 2016.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s poverty line is set at an an­nual in­come of about 4,000 yuan, about 12 per cent lower than the World Bank’s in­ter­na­tional stan­dard of US$1.90 a day (S$2.54).</p>
    <p>Its ap­proach to the prob­lem in­volves iden­ti­fy­ing im­pov­er­ished house­holds, of­ten re­lo­cat­ing them to homes nearer to ur­ban ar­eas, and find­ing ways to raise their in­comes, such as through skills train­ing or de­vel­op­ing ru­ral in­dus­tries to pro­vide jobs.</p>
    <p>The ob­jec­tive is to achieve what Chi­nese of­fi­cials call the “two nowor­ries and three guar­an­tees”, namely that peo­ple will not have to worry about food and cloth­ing, while hav­ing ac­cess to ed­u­ca­tion, ba­sic med­i­cal ser­vices and safe hous­ing.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign in­volves a mas­sive ur­ban­i­sa­tion project: new homes, schools and clin­ics are be­ing built, jobs are cre­ated, and the ru­ral poor are re­lo­cated from re­mote vil­lages to fill new set­tle­ments.</p>
    <p>In Sichuan alone, more than 370,000 new homes have been built for the ru­ral poor.</p>
    <p>Also, China’s rich coastal prov­inces have been paired with poor re­gions in the in­te­rior. The aim is to pro­vide fi­nan­cial sup­port to de­velop i ndus­tries which will, i n turn, cre­ate jobs.</p>
    <p>Close to three mil­lion party cadres have been de­ployed to vil­lages around the coun­try to help poor fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>In Liang­shan, these of­fi­cials also at­tempt to weed out what they view as back­ward cus­toms of the Yi mi­nor­ity, which they ar­gue are partly re­spon­si­ble for their poverty.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, lim­its are placed on be­trothal gifts and cadres are dis­patched to fam­i­lies be­fore fu­ner­als to make sure no more than two cows are killed for the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>On the ground, cadres like Ms Hao Wenkai make sure that the cen­tral gov­ern­ment’s di­rec­tives are re­alised.</p>
    <p>Ms Hao, who works for the county’s fi­nance bureau and has been as­signed to five dif­fer­ent fam­i­lies in the Gan En Com­mu­nity, says she checks in on them at least five times a month. She also makes sure vil­lagers go for skills train­ing and their chil­dren go to school.</p>
    <p>“It can be tir­ing work but when you see that they have food to eat and their chil­dren are go­ing to school, it’s very re­ward­ing,” the 27-year-old said.</p>
    <p>NOT THE END OF POVERTY</p>
    <p>Hav­ing lifted its im­pov­er­ished re­gions from ex­treme poverty, nowhere in China is of­fi­cially “poor” any longer.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts say this does not mean the end of poverty in China.</p>
    <p>China’s anti-poverty cam­paign fails to recog­nise poverty as a con­di­tion that can be­fall house­holds due to dis­as­ters, births, deaths or even a pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to Prof Don­ald­son.</p>
    <p>Its ap­proach in­stead “kind of as­sumes that once you’re sort of out of poverty, you’re out of poverty for­ever”, he said, adding that the cam­paign was a “mixed bag” in terms of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>And while Bei­jing has mar­shalled re­sources to help im­pov­er­ished house­holds, those just above the of­fi­cial poverty line do not get the same sort of sup­port, even though their lives are not sig­nif­i­cantly bet­ter. It is the “near poor” who are grap­pling with the im­pact of widespread flood­ing and Covid-19, and this is what wor­ries poverty ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing said ear­lier this year that it has al­ready iden­ti­fied 380,000 peo­ple who might be in dan­ger of fall­ing into poverty.</p>
    <p>“Ur­ban­i­sa­tion brings a lot of ben­e­fits, but it re­lies on gen­er­at­ing ur­ban jobs that may not be forth­com­ing, es­pe­cially in a down­turn. It also in­creases the cost of liv­ing,” said Prof Don­ald­son.</p>
    <p>In Liang­shan and else­where, the gov­ern­ment has of­ten re­sorted to em­ploy­ing many of these re­lo­cated vil­lagers to do odd jobs or other me­nial labour, but ex­perts say this is not sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>Such in­come might also not be sta­ble, as some vil­lagers can attest. Mr Shan Gui­jun, 35, used to farm a patch of land be­fore he was re­lo­cated to a new vil­lage, where he now does odd jobs.</p>
    <p>“If there is work, I can make 5,000 yuan a month, but if there is no work, then I don’t have any</p>
    <p>money,” said Mr Shan.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Yu Xiao­hua, chair of the Univer­sity of Got­tin­gen’s Agri­cul­tural Eco­nom­ics in De­vel­op­ing and Tran­si­tion Coun­tries, points out that China’s anti-poverty cam­paign re­lies heav­ily on fis­cal trans­fers from the coun­try’s rich coastal prov­inces to its poorer in­te­rior.</p>
    <p>But the rev­enues of these richer prov­inces have come un­der pres­sure be­cause of ten­sions be­tween China and the United States, and the im­pact they have had on manufactur­ing and global sup­ply chains, he said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing does not pub­li­cise fig­ures for its to­tal spend­ing on an­tipoverty projects, but said it was in­creas­ing spend­ing this year by 15.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>“This cam­paign-style poverty re­duc­tion is good at this stage, but it can­not last for a very long time,” said Prof Yu.</p>
    <p>Against the global eco­nomic slow­down caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic, China’s econ­omy is ex­pected to grow about 2 per cent this year, ac­cord­ing to es­ti­mates by the World Bank.</p>
    <p>While this pro­jected growth is higher than that of other economies in the re­gion, it is not suf­fi­cient to keep fund­ing China’s anti-poverty ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese anti-poverty cam­paign is like a big ele­phant rid­ing a bi­cy­cle. If the bi­cy­cle is still run­ning, with eco­nomic growth of 5 per cent or so, the gov­ern­ment can gen­er­ate enough rev­enue,” said Prof Yu.</p>
    <p>“But what hap­pens if the bi­cy­cle slows down or stops mov­ing?”</p>
    <p>For Mr Xi and the CCP, their ef­forts so far have trans­formed the lives of vil­lagers such as Mr Xie Jin­ming, and given the party its broad base of ru­ral sup­port.</p>
    <p>“My old home was dusty and dirty be­cause we had to have a fire lit to keep warm. Now, I have an elec­tric heater that the gov­ern­ment paid for,” said Mr Xie, 70, who had a new home built for him in Xu­ji­ashan vil­lage.</p>
    <p>His new apart­ment in Gan­luo county is spar­tan but he has mod­ern ameni­ties such as run­ning wa­ter, elec­tric­ity, a flat-screen TV – and a poster of Mr Xi. “The Com­mu­nist Party’s poli­cies are good. When the coun­try is rich, the peo­ple will also be rich,” Mr Xie said.</p>
