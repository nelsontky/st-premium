    <p>WHERE 01-166, Block 136 Be­dok North Av­enue 3</p>
    <p>OPEN 11.30am to 3pm, 5.30 to 10pm</p>
    <p>daily TEL 6245-5548</p>
    <p>With classical Thai food pre­sen­ta­tion, wal­let-friendly prices and a ca­sual am­bi­ence, Nangfa Thai Kitchen makes you feel as if you are on a quick Bangkok get­away – even though you are at a Hous­ing Board block in Be­dok North.</p>
    <p>It is so old school here that re­ceipts are still writ­ten by hand.</p>
    <p>The wooden tables and plas­tic stools are not the most com­fort­able, but they are func­tional.</p>
    <p>But the eatery, which is Sin­ga­porean-owned with Thai chefs, pays a sur­pris­ing level of at­ten­tion to food pre­sen­ta­tion. The dishes are served in restau­rant-wor­thy Thai crock­ery.</p>
    <p>The Pan­dan Leaves Chicken ($6 for four pieces) is a win­ner. Bone­less chicken thigh meat is mar­i­nated overnight in turmeric, co­rian­der, gar­lic, oys­ter sauce and a spe­cial spice blend. Wrapped in pan­dan leaves, the chicken is steamed be­fore it is fried, so that it is bouncy in tex­ture and flavour­some.</p>
    <p>The Tom Yam Thick Soup ($6) of­fers plenty of bang for the buck. You get a choice of seafood, prawn or chicken. I choose seafood,</p>
    <p>which comes with one prawn, three thick slices of fish and three slices of squid.</p>
    <p>In­stead of fiery, wa­tery tom yam that of­fers lit­tle com­plex­ity in flavour, the soup here is rich from the use of aro­mat­ics, such as kaf­fir lime leaves. There is a bal­ance of spicy, tangy, sweet and savoury flavours.</p>
    <p>The Thai Green Curry ($8) is</p>
    <p>avail­able with chicken, beef or prawn. It is tan­ta­lis­ingly aro­matic, with per­fectly cooked baby brin­jal.</p>
    <p>The Deep Fried Pork With Gar­lic ($6) is tasty de­spite its sim­ple mari­nade of oys­ter sauce, salt and gar­lic. It could be more ten­der, but at this price, you can over­look slight faults.</p>
    <p>I re­turn to try the eatery’s more pre­mium items, such as Clay­pot</p>
    <p>Tanghoon With Prawns ($16) and Deep Fried Grouper With Mango Salad ($28). Sadly, these do not live up to my ex­pec­ta­tions, built up from how good the more eco­nom­i­cal dishes tasted.</p>
    <p>With safe dis­tanc­ing, the eatery can take only 40 din­ers at a time.</p>
    <p>So it is best to go early, as seats fill up quickly. A queue forms for din­ner, even on week­days.</p>
