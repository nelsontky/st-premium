    <p>SYD­NEY • A tor­rid row over Aus­tralia’s state bor­der clo­sures has pushed the coun­try’s prime min­is­ter to tears, sparked bitter re­crim­i­na­tions among ri­val re­gional lead­ers and even talk of se­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Travel be­tween the na­tion’s in­de­pen­dent-minded states and ter­ri­to­ries has been mostly banned since Covid-19 hit Aus­tralia in March.</p>
    <p>But an un­happy fed­eral gov­ern­ment is ratch­et­ing pres­sure on state pre­miers to open up their bor­ders, send­ing the ar­gu­ment into over­drive.</p>
    <p>Me­dia cov­er­age has high­lighted the plight of griev­ing fam­i­lies sep­a­rated by the clo­sures and tar­geted state of­fi­cials they deem re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>One fam­ily fac­ing a huge quar­an­tine bill to see their dy­ing father re­ceived more than A$200,000 (S$199,000) in do­na­tions when their ordeal be­came pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily of Mr Mark Keans, 39, who has ter­mi­nal can­cer, had pre­vi­ously been told that only one of his four Syd­ney-based chil­dren would be able to en­ter Queens­land to see him. The state cur­rently blocks al­most all ar­rivals from New South Wales – which it considers a Covid-19 hot spot.</p>
    <p>“How do you choose which child gets that chance to see their dad for the last time?” Mr Keans’ sis­ter Ta­mara Lang­borne told na­tional broad­caster ABC.</p>
    <p>Such is the level of anger that Queens­land’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer has been forced to seek po­lice protection after threats on her life.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia be­gan life as six self-gov­ern­ing Bri­tish states and ter­ri­to­ries that agreed to form a fed­er­a­tion around 1900. Ri­valry be­tween those re­gions has long per­sisted – usu­ally on the sports field and in light­hearted jokes – but the coro­n­avirus out­break has made re­gional sen­ti­ment more pro­nounced, and more pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>Many pre­miers ad­vo­cat­ing state lock­downs have seen their pub­lic ap­proval rat­ings rocket.</p>
    <p>Western Aus­tralia’s cen­tre-left Pre­mier, Mr Mark McGowan, was cheered on as he pil­lo­ried the “Pinot gri­gio-sip­ping” com­men­tariat in Syd­ney – near where he was born – for telling him to open up the state. Western Aus­tralia, he in­sisted, will re­main “an is­land within an is­land”.</p>
    <p>An ap­prov­ing lo­cal pa­per has de­clared its own “Wes­tralia Day” and #WAexit has trended on so­cial me­dia, a West Aus­tralian echo of Britain’s ran­corous exit of the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tive Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son has ex­pressed con­cern that “at times” over the past months “it has felt like Aus­tralia could break apart”.</p>
    <p>Al­though he had long sought to ap­pear above the fray, he has now joined the fight.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent ra­dio in­ter­view, Mr Mor­ri­son said he had per­son­ally pleaded with the cen­tre-left Pre­mier of Queens­land to al­low nurse Sarah Caisip to at­tend her father’s funeral after trav­el­ling from Can­berra.</p>
    <p>“I’ve ap­pealed to her to over­rule the de­ci­sion that would al­low Sarah to go to the funeral,” he told 2GB ra­dio tear­fully.</p>
    <p>Ms Caisip, 26, wrote a scathing let­ter to Queens­land’s Pre­mier, Ms An­nasta­cia Palaszczuk, after she ap­plied for an exemption to visit her dy­ing father but was not ap­proved un­til last Fri­day, two days after his death, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>“It’s not about bor­ders, it’s not about fed­er­a­tion, it’s not about politi­cians, it’s not about elec­tions,” Mr Mor­ri­son told 2GB.</p>
    <p>But Mr Mor­ri­son’s crit­ics say that is ex­actly what the row is about.</p>
    <p>Many of the bor­der rows are fought down po­lit­i­cal lines, with Mr Mor­ri­son’s fed­eral gov­ern­ment tar­get­ing states with op­po­si­tion La­bor Party lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Palaszczuk hap­pens to be in the thick of a hard-fought re-elec­tion campaign against Mr Mor­ri­son’s Con­ser­va­tive coali­tion can­di­date. She has since re­sponded, ac­knowl­edg­ing “heart­break­ing” cases, but in­sist­ing that she will not be bul­lied or in­tim­i­dated over poli­cies de­signed to keep Queens­lan­ders safe.</p>
    <p>Western Aus­tralia’s Mr McGowan has sug­gested that Ms Palaszczuk was be­ing sin­gled out ahead of a state elec­tion in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>“Tas­ma­nia and South Aus­tralia have bor­ders – I don’t see them be­ing at­tacked,” Mr McGowan said of the Lib­eral-run states.</p>
    <p>“I just urge ev­ery­one, at a na­tional level, to pull back on par­ti­san at­tacks,” he said.</p>
