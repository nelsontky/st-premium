    <p>In­done­sian Parti Liyani was ini­tially charged in 2018 with steal­ing items worth more than $50,000 from Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>She was ac­cused of steal­ing:</p>
    <p>• A DVD player and two bags from Mr Liew;</p>
    <p>• 120 pieces of cloth­ing, two watches, two wal­lets, a DVD player, two phones, bed­li­nen and kitchen­ware from Mr Liew’s son Karl;</p>
    <p>• Two coun­ter­feit watches and as­sorted fash­ion ac­ces­sories from Mr Liew’s daugh­ter Cheng May; and</p>
    <p>• A bag and a pair of sun­glasses from Mr Karl Liew’s wife Heather.</p>
    <p>The items were al­legedly found in three boxes that Miss Parti packed af­ter she was sacked on Oct 28, 2016.</p>
    <p>She con­tested the four charges in a 22-day trial, say­ing that the items were either bought by her, given to her, dis­carded and found by her, or had been put into the boxes by some­one else.</p>
    <p>In March last year, a district judge found her guilty and handed down a 26-month jail sen­tence. The judge re­moved two wal­lets and five items of cloth­ing from the charges, as there was doubt over whether they be­longed to Mr Karl Liew, and low­ered the value of the items to about $34,000.</p>
    <p>Miss Parti ap­pealed to the High Court, which ac­quit­ted her yes­ter­day. She still faces a charge of fraud­u­lent pos­ses­sion of prop­erty.</p>
