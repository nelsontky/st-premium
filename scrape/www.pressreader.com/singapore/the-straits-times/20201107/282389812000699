    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR EU­GENE TAN, on whether Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee will be elected to the PAP’s cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) will elect its top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body to­mor­row via dis­trib­uted vot­ing, a de­par­ture from the norm ne­ces­si­tated by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, the more than 2,000 PAP cadres would gather at a sin­gle venue such as the Sin­ga­pore Expo dur­ing the bi­en­nial party con­fer­ence to cast their votes for the cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee (CEC).</p>
    <p>But with safe dis­tanc­ing rules in place, cadres will to­mor­row morn­ing gather at their re­spec­tive branches in­stead, party sources told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Each of the party’s 93 branch sec­re­taries and two other mem­bers from each branch will be de­ployed to other branches to fa­cil­i­tate the vot­ing process and act as count­ing agents. Party lead­ers and MPs will gather at the NTUC Cen­tre near Raf­fles Place, and cast their votes there.</p>
    <p>On each bal­lot slip, seven names will be high­lighted to sig­nal the PAP’s own choice for its core lead­ers. Cadres can choose up to 12 names to form the party’s high­est de­ci­sion-mak­ing body.</p>
    <p>The votes from each venue will be added up and the 12 who re­ceive the high­est num­ber of votes will form the 36th CEC. Un­der the party’s Con­sti­tu­tion, the com­mit­tee can co-opt up to six more peo­ple, for a to­tal of 18.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that the party will high­light the same seven names as two years ago. They are: Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, 68; Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, 59; Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, 51; Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shanmugam, 61; Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, 61; Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Grace Fu, 56; and So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, 57.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, the PAP’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral, will ad­dress the party from NTUC Cen­tre to­mor­row. His speech will be streamed live to mem­bers at the branches.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal ob­servers told ST they do not ex­pect any ma­jor changes to the party’s lead­er­ship, given the on­go­ing public health and eco­nomic crises. Any dras­tic changes at the top could send the wrong sig­nal and even have a desta­bil­is­ing ef­fect, they said.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng and Mr Chan are the party’s first and sec­ond as­sis­tant sec­re­taries-gen­eral. There were ques­tions raised in some quar­ters over whether its suc­ces­sion plan should be relooked, af­ter the team led by Mr Heng in East Coast GRC gar­nered 53.4 per cent of the vote against a Work­ers’ Party team in the last gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Bil­veer Singh, a po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist, said un­der­min­ing the top two lead­ers of the party’s fourth-gen­er­a­tion (4G) lead­er­ship team would sig­nal “in­tense pol­i­tick­ing and pos­si­bly fac­tion­al­ism within the PAP”, and hurt the party in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sta­bil­ity and con­ti­nu­ity should be the theme, he added.</p>
    <p>One thing to watch will be whether Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee be­come elected CEC mem­bers, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eu­gene Tan from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s law school.</p>
    <p>“I won’t be sur­prised if the party faith­ful feel they are de­serv­ing,” Prof Tan added.</p>
    <p>Both men, who were co-opted in 2018, are seen as key mem­bers of the 4G team. The party chose Mr Wong to front its post-mortem press con­fer­ence on GE2020, while Mr Lee led the party’s re­view on its elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Dr Felix Tan, an as­so­ciate lec­turer at SIM Global Ed­u­ca­tion, noted that Mr Wong in par­tic­u­lar has been pushed to the fore­front this year, ow­ing to his role as cochair of the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But the ex­perts were split on whether labour chief Ng Chee Meng, who lost the con­test for Sengkang GRC in the July gen­eral elec­tion, will be on the bal­lot this year.</p>
    <p>Prof Singh said hav­ing Mr Ng in the CEC would set a “bad prece­dent”, given that he is no longer a min­is­ter or MP, while Dr Tan sug­gested that the PAP might give Mr Ng a prom­i­nent po­si­tion within the party, but stop short of putting his name on the CEC bal­lot.</p>
    <p>But Prof Tan said he would be sur­prised if Mr Ng is not re-elected to the CEC. “I be­lieve the party will rally be­hind him and un­der­line its com­mit­ment to the close re­la­tion­ship be­tween the PAP and the NTUC,” he said.</p>
