    <p>DE­VEL­OP­ING NEW SO­LU­TIONS</p>
    <p>Start-ups play an im­por­tant role in co-de­vel­op­ing novel, sus­tain­able and in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions that not only have the po­ten­tial to solve Sin­ga­pore’s waste prob­lem, but could also be ex­ported to ad­dress ris­ing re­gional ’’ de­mand.</p>
    <p>MR YEOH CHOON JIN, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s di­rec­tor of ur­ban so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Road con­struc­tion ma­te­rial, beer and en­ergy – th­ese are some things that start-ups in Sin­ga­pore are look­ing to pro­duce as they re­use or re­cy­cle waste.</p>
    <p>Waste man­age­ment is a grow­ing sec­tor here, with more in­no­va­tors and en­trepreneur­s work­ing across the en­tire sup­ply chain, from col­lec­tion to pro­cess­ing, and in ed­u­ca­tion, said ecosys­tem play­ers.</p>
    <p>With a new na­tional in­no­va­tion challenge on food waste an­nounced on Dec 7, start-ups have even more op­por­tu­ni­ties to of­fer their so­lu­tions and col­lab­o­rate with other com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Three lo­cal start-ups were among eight fi­nal­ists last month in a waste tech start-up com­pe­ti­tion,</p>
    <p>Waste 20/20. One of the three, Mago­rium, emerged as the win­ner.</p>
    <p>More than 100 start-ups from 32 coun­tries took part in the com­pe­ti­tion, which was or­gan­ised by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, Star­tupX and The In­cu­ba­tion Net­work.</p>
    <p>Mago­rium founder Oh Chu Xian said the start-up’s road con­struc­tion ma­te­rial pro­to­types were born out of an idea to cre­ate an al­ter­na­tive and sus­tain­able con­struc­tion ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, started in the mid­dle of last year, has made pro­to­types from plas­tic bot­tles, plas­tic bags and milk car­tons. It is in the midst of draft­ing patents for its cur­rent ver­sion of the prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing why she par­tic­i­pated in the com­pe­ti­tion, Ms Oh said: “It was the first time that I saw so many rel­e­vant stake­hold­ers in the waste ecosys­tem in­volved, and it was more about ac­cess­ing the plat­form to con­nect with them rather than want­ing to win.”</p>
    <p>She said that while the waste start-up scene here is still nascent, there are steps be­ing taken to sup­port com­pa­nies in the sec­tor, and she hopes more industry men­tors can step in to pro­vide sup­port to start-ups in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>An­other com­pe­ti­tion fi­nal­ist, Crust Group, which trans­forms food waste into bev­er­ages, piv­oted from a bev­er­age com­pany to food tech amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It uses in­gre­di­ents like bread and fruit peel to pro­duce beer and non­al­co­holic drinks. It has so far saved about 400kg of food that would have been lost, said co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Travin Singh.</p>
    <p>He noted that from 2024, busi­nesses that gen­er­ate a lot of food waste will be re­quired to treat it, and must find a way to han­dle the waste them­selves or seek out com­pa­nies like Crust to deal with it.</p>
    <p>“With Sin­ga­pore’s fo­cus on bet­ter waste man­age­ment, we see many op­por­tu­ni­ties for us to start here and help to de­velop a more ro­bust waste man­age­ment ecosys­tem,” Mr Singh said.</p>
    <p>Mr Kevin Kee, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Waste 20/20 fi­nal­ist E2S2 Sys­tems, which sup­plies or­ganic waste treat­ment sys­tems to com­mer­cial premises such as ho­tels and shop­ping cen­tres, said Covid-19 has brought more at­ten­tion to hy­giene and waste man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>This has spurred the com­pany – whose treat­ment sys­tems con­vert waste to elec­tric­ity, heat and fer­tiliser – to pri­ori­tise govern­ment and reg­u­la­tory pro­jects, he said.</p>
    <p>AD­DRESS­ING GAPS</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s di­rec­tor of ur­ban so­lu­tions Yeoh Choon Jin said there are two ways in which start-ups can con­trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore’s waste man­age­ment: by im­prov­ing the ef­fi­ciency of waste re­cy­cling; and by cre­at­ing value out of refuse, for eco­nomic vi­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>He said that the waste man­age­ment sec­tor is fairly ma­ture, with many com­pa­nies pre­fer­ring to stick to con­ven­tional meth­ods.</p>
    <p>“Thus, start-ups play an im­por­tant role in co-de­vel­op­ing novel, sus­tain­able and in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions that not only have the po­ten­tial to solve Sin­ga­pore’s waste prob­lem but could also be ex­ported to ad­dress ris­ing re­gional de­mand,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Dur­win Ho, chief ex­ec­u­tive of start-up ecosys­tem player Star­tupX, said that while more funds have been chan­nelled to­wards the waste sec­tor in re­cent years, much of the fund­ing from global in­vestors goes to­wards late-stage com­mer­cialised so­lu­tions, which are few and far be­tween in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“Start-ups will def­i­nitely re­quire huge cap­i­tal in­vest­ment from an early (stage) to build and scale their so­lu­tions, but while there is gen­eral in­ter­est from in­vestors, a lack of knowl­edge of the waste sec­tor also hin­ders most ven­ture cap­i­tal firms in Asia from ac­tively in­vest­ing in this space,” he said.</p>
    <p>While waste in­no­va­tion in Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia is con­sid­ered nascent com­pared with global mar­kets, it is clear that gov­ern­ments and stake­hold­ers in the re­gion are mak­ing greater com­mit­ments to deal with global waste, Mr Ho said.</p>
    <p>The In­cu­ba­tion Net­work’s tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor Mat­teo Chi­ampo said there has been an in­crease in the num­ber of waste man­age­ment so­lu­tions as well as in­ter­est in cir­cu­lar so­lu­tions – which re­fer to waste be­ing up­cy­cled into us­able prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>He urged South-east Asian in­vestors in the sec­tor to have pa­tience and ded­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>High­light­ing the fund­ing gap be­tween early-stage and larger lat­estage rounds, he said: “This calls for a new ap­proach to in­vest­ment in the sec­tor, to blend fi­nanc­ing mech­a­nisms that bring to­gether the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors to in­vest for max­i­mum im­pact.”</p>
