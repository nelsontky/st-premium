    <p>A restau­rant in Chi­na­town has been or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions, af­ter a check af­ter mid­night last Sat­ur­day found pa­trons con­sum­ing al­co­hol past the 10.30pm restric­tion.</p>
    <p>Wang Zi Chu Fang also failed to en­sure din­ers were lim­ited to groups of five and that a 1m space was left be­tween them, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The joint op­er­a­tion by STB and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force found that the restau­rant had pro­vided cus­tomers with drink­ing games, which food and bev­er­age out­lets are not al­lowed to do with­out an amuse­ment cen­tre li­cence.</p>
    <p>The es­tab­lish­ment was fined in July for breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>STB also is­sued $1,000 fines to Bistro Du Le Pin at Or­chard Plaza and Wang Dae Bak in Amoy Street for not en­sur­ing that cus­tomers kept a safe dis­tance apart.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) said in a sep­a­rate state­ment yes­ter­day that it had fined five restau­rants and a beauty sa­lon for flout­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures, fol­low­ing a sweep last month.</p>
    <p>New Udon Thai Food at Golden Mile Com­plex was fined $2,000 for fail­ing to en­sure a 1m space be­tween groups of din­ers, its sec­ond in­fringe­ment since June.</p>
    <p>King of Fried Rice and Leng Saap @ Rot Fai Mar­ket at Golden Mile Tower, and Lit­tle Myan­mar</p>
    <p>Restau­rant and Yanant Thit at Penin­sula Plaza were fined $1,000 each for the same of­fence.</p>
    <p>Beauty sa­lon Mei Mei Beauty at Peo­ple’s Park Com­plex was fined $1,000 af­ter it was found to be of­fer­ing thread­ing ser­vices where the thread is held in the beau­ti­cian’s mouth. This prac­tice is cur­rently dis­al­lowed, ESG said.</p>
    <p>If these busi­nesses con­tinue to flout the rules, they may face higher fines, sus­pen­sion and even court charges, the agency warned.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, first-time of­fend­ers may be fined up to $10,000 and jailed for up to six months, while re­peat of­fences may in­cur a fine of up to $20,000 and im­pris­on­ment of up to 12 months.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited Golden Mile Com­plex at din­ner time yes­ter­day, crowds were seen at ea­ter­ies in­clud­ing New Udon, though groups were kept to a max­i­mum of five.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, ESG urged firms to play their part in keep­ing staff and cus­tomers safe amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, such as by in­ter­ven­ing when groups of cus­tomers in­ter­min­gle.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic should also be so­cially re­spon­si­ble and com­ply with the mea­sures put in place at es­tab­lish­ments, it said.</p>
