    <p>BRASILIA • Brazil­ian sy­ringe and nee­dle mak­ers have warned that the coun­try’s coro­n­avirus vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme was at risk af­ter the gov­ern­ment set auction prices too low and failed to draw bids for enough sy­ringes to meet its re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry sought to buy 331 mil­lion sy­ringes at an elec­tronic auction on Tues­day but pur­chased just eight mil­lion, or 2.5 per cent of its tar­get, af­ter it set ref­er­ence prices be­low com­pa­nies’ bids.</p>
    <p>That means that Brazil, where Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro has down­played the cri­sis and which al­ready lags be­hind neigh­bours Chile and Ar­gentina in rolling out a vac­cine, runs the risk of not hav­ing enough sy­ringes to dis­trib­ute vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Brazil has not yet ap­proved a vac­cine and there is no clear date to be­gin a vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has recorded the world’s third-high­est num­ber of Covid-19 cases, at more than 7.6 mil­lion, and the se­cond-high­est death toll, at al­most 195,000.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry set the num­ber of sy­ringes and nee­dles to be pro­vided and an es­ti­mated price for the auction.</p>
    <p>Mr Paulo Hen­rique Frac­caro, head of Brazil’s med­i­cal sup­plies and equip­ment in­dus­try lobby group Abimo, said on Wed­nes­day: “The ref­er­ence prices set by the gov­ern­ment have no re­la­tion to the re­al­ity that sy­ringe com­pa­nies are liv­ing.”</p>
    <p>The min­istry of­fered 13 cen­tavos (3 Sin­ga­pore cents) per sy­ringe, while com­pa­nies were ask­ing for be­tween 22 cen­tavos and 48 cen­tavos depend­ing on the item, Mr Frac­caro said.</p>
    <p>Given that Sao Paulo, the rich­est state, has al­ready bought 50 mil­lion sy­ringes and plans to buy another 50 mil­lion, the en­tire coun­try would need some 320 mil­lion sy­ringes, which would cost at most 120 mil­lion reais, added Mr Frac­caro.</p>
    <p>The prospect of run­ning out of sy­ringes could cause panic in the coun­try or lead to more costly im­ports, he warned.</p>
