    <p>With Myan­mar’s rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD) se­cure af­ter its thump­ing vic­tory in the Nov 8 gen­eral elec­tion, at­ten­tion has now turned to what its new Cab­i­net next year may look like. Much of it will be up to its enig­matic leader Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
    <p>The 75-year-old state coun­sel­lor has let on lit­tle so far, busy­ing her­self as chief com­mu­ni­ca­tor in the coun­try’s mount­ing bat­tle against the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has killed more than 1,900 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>On Nov 8, the NLD bagged 396 of the 476 con­tested seats in the na­tional Par­lia­ment, im­prov­ing on its score in the 2015 polls, and win­ning an ab­so­lute ma­jor­ity as well as the all-im­por­tant power to pick who be­comes pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>It is a role that she is blocked from as­sum­ing be­cause the junta-crafted 2008 Constituti­on bars any can­di­date whose spouse or chil­dren are for­eign cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Ms Suu Kyi, ed­u­cated at the Univer­sity of Ox­ford, has two sons who are Bri­tish cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>The daugh­ter of Myan­mar’s in­de­pen­dence hero Aung San, she spent some 15 years un­der house ar­rest by the junta, which ruled the coun­try for five decades.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the NLD’s sweep­ing vic­tory in the 2015 elec­tion, its gov­ern­ment cre­ated the role of state coun­sel­lor for Ms Suu Kyi. Backed by a loy­al­ist pres­i­dent, she be­came de facto head of state.</p>
    <p>But the power she as­sumed five years ago bound her to an un­gainly lock­step with Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>The Constituti­on gives the mil­i­tary con­trol of the de­fence, home af­fairs and bor­der af­fairs min­istries, and re­serves a quar­ter of all par­lia­men­tary seats for mil­i­tary ap­pointees.</p>
    <p>Five years on, she has gained the up­per hand. Not only did the mil­i­tary-linked Union Sol­i­dar­ity and De­vel­op­ment Party shed 14 of its seats to win just 33 in the na­tional Par­lia­ment, its de­mand for re-elec­tion and a re­count has gen­er­ated only a luke­warm re­sponse from the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Yan Myo Thein de­scribes Ms Suu Kyi as a “soft dic­ta­tor” who is lead­ing po­lit­i­cal change, but who has failed to de­velop her po­lit­i­cal party from within. A key con­cern is suc­ces­sion, with the av­er­age age of mem­bers in the party’s top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body more than 70 years.</p>
    <p>To for­mer sup­port­ers out­side Myan­mar, Ms Suu Kyi is a No­bel Peace Prize win­ner who fell from grace af­ter she de­fended the mil­i­tary against al­le­ga­tions it com­mit­ted geno­cide against the Mus­lim Ro­hingya. To many in­side Myan­mar, how­ever, she is “Mother Suu”, the only per­son stand­ing be­tween them and di­rect mil­i­tary rule.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple were wor­ried about the pos­si­ble re­turn of mil­i­tary rule or dic­ta­tor­ship and they did not have any com­pet­i­tive sec­ond op­tion other than Aung San Suu Kyi,” said po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Yan Myo Thein.</p>
    <p>Un­der Ms Suu Kyi, the NLD gov­ern­ment is highly cen­tralised. Crit­ics al­lege she is mi­cro­manag­ing, and many in Myan­mar hes­i­tate to openly speak ill of her for fear of trig­ger­ing a back­lash from her for­mi­da­ble fan base.</p>
    <p>NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt de­scribes the state coun­sel­lor as metic­u­lous. “What­ever she works on, she does it care­fully,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“She is a sharp de­ci­sion-maker.” It was Ms Suu Kyi who sug­gested that the party open a Face­book ac­count this year for the NLD chair­man, he said. Fea­tur­ing her videos, images and mes­sages promi­nently, this “Chair NLD” ac­count has amassed 1.4 mil­lion fol­low­ers and was in­stru­men­tal in keep­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tion lines open with sup­port­ers while nor­mal elec­tion cam­paign­ing was re­stricted by the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The NLD has closely guarded its po­lit­i­cal turf. Un­der the Constituti­on, Myan­mar’s pres­i­dent has the power to ap­point the chief min­is­ter in each of the na­tion’s 14 states and re­gions – much to the cha­grin of politi­cians in eth­nic mi­nor­ity states like Rakhine where op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers out­num­ber those of the NLD in the lo­cal leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>NLD leg­is­la­tors blocked a bid to let lo­cal leg­is­la­tures choose their chief min­is­ters, wary it could turn the mil­i­tary’s ap­pointed par­lia­men­tar­i­ans, who oc­cupy a quar­ter of all seats, into king­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>But the NLD gov­ern­ment has also mod­i­fied its ap­proach along the way, ac­cord­ing to Dr Narue­mon Thabchumpo­n, direc­tor of Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity’s Asian Re­search Cen­tre for Mi­gra­tion. It “decon­cen­trated” power last year by giv­ing chief min­is­ters more say in eco­nomic projects, she said, adding that it was still not enough to amount to de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Suu Kyi will need to change her au­to­cratic style, said Dr Narue­mon. Grow­ing ur­ban­i­sa­tion and more for­malised sys­tems of gov­er­nance will fuel calls for trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Dr Yan Myo Thein de­scribes Ms Suu Kyi as a “soft dic­ta­tor” who is lead­ing po­lit­i­cal change, but who has failed to de­velop her po­lit­i­cal party from within.</p>
    <p>A key con­cern is suc­ces­sion, with the av­er­age age of mem­bers in the party’s top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body more than 70 years.</p>
    <p>In be­tween bat­tling Covid-19, shoring up Myan­mar’s pan­demi­chit economy and try­ing to end the coun­try’s long-run­ning civil war with var­i­ous eth­nic armed groups, Ms Suu Kyi will face grow­ing ques­tions about party re­newal.</p>
    <p>“Time is not on her side. Peo­ple are ask­ing, who is go­ing to come af­ter her,” said Dr Narue­mon.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are look­ing at how to democra­tise the NLD to cre­ate more bal­ance.”</p>
    <p>In this re­gard, Dr Myo Nyunt said: “It is im­por­tant for us to last as a party... We will give po­si­tions to youth, es­pe­cially the eth­nic (mi­nor­ity) youth if they were qual­i­fied to work for our party.”</p>
