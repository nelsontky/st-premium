    <p>Thir­teen peo­ple, in­clud­ing two mi­nors, failed to com­ply with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures amid the Covid-19 out­break and met one an­other for a gath­er­ing dur­ing phase two of the eco­nomic re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>The gath­er­ing at a fit­ness cor­ner near Block 42 Beo Crescent, off Have­lock Road, in the wee hours of June 28 was so noisy that it kept a res­i­dent in a nearby flat awake.</p>
    <p>He alerted the po­lice, who ar­rived on the scene soon there­after.</p>
    <p>Four of the mer­ry­mak­ers pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act. A sec­ond charge un­der the same Act and one charge un­der the Liquor Con­trol (Sup­ply and Con­sump­tion) Act were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans Nur Sal­iza Mo­hamed Sani, 23; Nu­rul Sheilla Nata­sya Suhaimi, 25; Nu­raznie Ith­nin, 31; and Muham­mad Zaki Jo­hari, 33, were each fined $4,000.</p>
    <p>Six other Sin­ga­pore­ans, who were al­legedly part of the gath­er­ing, face sim­i­lar charges.</p>
    <p>They are: Sai Raghu Vaish­navee Ragu, 18; Aqlima Ab­dul Azmi, 19; Mo­hamad Iman Ab­dul Rahim, 19; Remy Shah Hail Mee, 20; Mo­ham­mad Zack Da­nial Ahamad Zaki, 20; and Norsyahmi Norhe­sham, 21. Their cases are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, the po­lice said that three oth­ers, in­clud­ing a 14-year-old boy, were also at the gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The boy was given a 12-month con­di­tional warn­ing. The other two, a 15-year-old boy and a 26-year-old Malaysian man, were be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for un­re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>As part of phase two of the re­open­ing, which took ef­fect on June 19, each house­hold may re­ceive up to five vis­i­tors a day. This means groups of up to five peo­ple can also meet out­side of homes, such as at res­tau­rants for meals.</p>
    <p>They should, how­ever, prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing and avoid mix­ing be­tween dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
    <p>At least two of the al­leged of­fend­ers, Norsyahmi and Zack Da­nial, live in dif­fer­ent units at Block 42 Beo Crescent.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court heard that Muham­mad Zaki and Zack Da­nial planned to con­sume al­co­holic drinks on the evening of June 27.</p>
    <p>Muham­mad Zaki then bought two bot­tles of liquor while Zack Da­nial set up two por­ta­ble ta­bles at the fit­ness cor­ner.</p>
    <p>The gath­er­ing started at around 9pm that day, and all 13 peo­ple met at the lo­ca­tion. All of them, ex­cept for the two mi­nors, con­sumed al­co­hol there, the court heard.</p>
    <p>The po­lice were no­ti­fied shortly be­fore 1am, and an of­fi­cer ar­rived at the scene min­utes later. The gath­er­ing ended soon af­ter.</p>
