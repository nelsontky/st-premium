    <p>★ Joe Bi­den moves ahead in key states of Penn­syl­va­nia, Ge­or­gia</p>
    <p>★ He is ahead in Ne­vada and Ari­zona, as count­ing con­tin­ues</p>
    <p>★ Don­ald Trump claims elec­tion be­ing stolen, in­sists race is not over</p>
    <p>★ Amer­i­cans are di­vided down the mid­dle, reds ver­sus blues</p>
    <p>★ Win­ner must heal this rift and unite the states, says Jeremy Au Yong,</p>
    <p>Through his last cam­paign swing in the elec­tion, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den had a con­stant re­frain about why he should be­come the next pres­i­dent: Un­like Mr Don­ald Trump, he said, he can heal the disunited states of Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>To­day, as the US re­flects on one of the most di­vi­sive elec­tions in its his­tory, it would take an ex­tremely op­ti­mistic voter to be­lieve that any sort of rec­on­cil­i­a­tion is pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>In the haze fu­elled by the over­whelm­ingly pro-Bi­den opin­ion polls dur­ing the fi­nal days of the cam­paign, the Democrats saw a vi­sion of a blue wave.</p>
    <p>It was sup­posed to be of one where the na­tion came to­gether to vote for Mr Bi­den by his­toric mar­gins, send­ing an un­de­ni­able mes­sage of to­tal re­pu­di­a­tion of the pol­i­tics of Mr Trump and prompt­ing a deep soul-search­ing by the Repub­li­cans who stood by the po­lar­is­ing Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>That re­pu­di­a­tion proved to be a delu­sion.</p>
    <p>While the elec­tion re­sults have yet to un­equiv­o­cally de­clare a win­ner, it has at least made clear that Mr Trump’s vic­tory in 2016 was no fluke or an aber­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>In fact, when all is fi­nally done and dusted, more Amer­i­cans would have voted for him this year than dur­ing his first, suc­cess­ful, run for the White House.</p>
    <p>That Mr Bi­den is still on the brink of vic­tory is a sign not of any broad re­jec­tion of Mr Trump by the elec­torate but of the wors­en­ing di­vide that will face the next Amer­i­can pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump out­per­formed his 2016 num­bers in ru­ral ar­eas in many in­stances, just as Mr Bi­den out­per­formed his pre­de­ces­sor Hil­lary Clin­ton’s num­bers in ur­ban ar­eas. Many red dis­tricts got red­der, and the blue, bluer.</p>
    <p>What caused such a di­vide to open up in the US?</p>
    <p>The re­flex­ive an­swer is to blame Mr Trump. But the Pres­i­dent is as much a symp­tom of the prob­lem as he is the cause of it. The di­vi­sions now made stark by the 2020 elec­tion have been fes­ter­ing for decades.</p>
    <p>All the Trump pres­i­dency did was to stick a crow­bar into the frac­ture and yank.</p>
    <p>TWO AMER­I­CAS</p>
    <p>Per­haps in nowhere else in the world is one’s po­lit­i­cal af­fil­i­a­tion so closely cor­re­lated to a whole host of other be­liefs.</p>
    <p>Democrats are more likely to sup­port stricter gun reg­u­la­tion, im­mi­gra­tion re­form that al­lows those who en­ter the coun­try il­le­gally to have a path­way to cit­i­zen­ship, and univer­sal health­care. Repub­li­cans, on the other hand, are more likely to take the op­po­site stand and be so­cially con­ser­va­tive as well on is­sues like abor­tion and LGBT (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der) rights.</p>
    <p>But there is also par­ti­san dis­agree­ment on is­sues that ap­pear to have no con­nec­tion to pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to exit polls from The New York Times, Bi­den vot­ers were twice as likely as Trump vot­ers to con­sider wear­ing a face mask in public a public health re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>For most of the mod­ern era, the two ma­jor par­ties have long main­tained op­pos­ing ide­olo­gies with­out the bit­ter ran­cour seen to­day.</p>
    <p>In the sim­plest of terms: Democrats sup­port more gov­ern­ment while Repub­li­cans do not.</p>
    <p>In prac­tice, that meant Democrats were more likely to be the party that sup­ported large gov­ern­ment-sup­ported wel­fare and so­cial pro­grammes, while the Repub­li­can party backed dereg­u­la­tion, free trade and low taxes.</p>
    <p>This frame­work, while still ap­pli­ca­ble in some se­lect in­stances – a Repub­li­can is more likely to doubt cli­mate sci­ence be­cause to ac­knowl­edge it ne­ces­si­tates a large gov­ern­ment re­sponse – is now de­funct.</p>
    <p>What could be de­scribed as a pol­icy dis­agree­ment about how to tackle the is­sues of the day has mor­phed into a clash of class and cul­ture.</p>
    <p>To­day, some­one’s opin­ion on min­i­mum wage is far less likely to be a pre­dic­tor of which po­lit­i­cal party he sup­ports than whether he lives in ur­ban or ru­ral ar­eas, the colour of his skin and even whether he be­lieves in god.</p>
    <p>Some 76 per cent of white evan­gel­i­cal Chris­tians voted for Mr Trump this week, while 87 per cent of black Amer­i­cans voted for Mr Bi­den, ac­cord­ing to The New York Times.</p>
    <p>That the dis­agree­ments are now in­ter­twined with iden­tity and moral­ity makes the di­vide es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult to mend.</p>
    <p>To many Amer­i­cans, the dis­agree­ments are now not so much in­tel­lec­tual as they are per­sonal. Peo­ple don’t just dis­agree, they make moral j udg­ments about some­one else be­cause of that dis­agree­ment.</p>
    <p>This has been seen most starkly dur­ing the Trump era.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Mrs Clin­ton was crit­i­cised for re­fer­ring to those who sup­ported Mr Trump as “de­plorables”, yet it was very likely an ac­cu­rate re­flec­tion of how she and her base felt.</p>
    <p>A Pew Re­search Cen­tre poll last year found that over seven in 10 sin­gle and dat­ing Democrats would not con­sider a re­la­tion­ship with some­one who voted for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Many Democrats saw the 2016 elec­tion as a ref­er­en­dum on big­otry. It was not rare to hear Democrats lament in the wake of Mrs Clin­ton’s loss that half of their fel­low coun­try­men – in some cases mem­bers of their own fam­ily – were racists.</p>
    <p>This pat­tern was ev­i­dent again this week as Mr Trump out­per­formed main­stream ex­pec­ta­tions. Again there was hand-wring­ing from lib­er­als about how so many peo­ple could en­dorse racism and au­toc­racy.</p>
    <p>Need­less to say, Trump sup­port­ers see things quite dif­fer­ently. None of them would ac­cept the for­mu­la­tion of an elec­tion as a ref­eren</p>
    <p>DYS­FUNC­TION IN POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>dum on big­otry or racism. What they saw in­stead was con­fir­ma­tion of their sus­pi­cions that the elite in the cities looked down on them.</p>
    <p>This was es­pe­cially true for dis­af­fected white men who have long re­sented the rul­ing elite. This group holds the elite re­spon­si­ble for the glob­al­i­sa­tion and de­mo­graphic shifts that have so af­fected their prospects and liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>On top of this were the al­le­ga­tions that the Democrats were rad­i­cal so­cial­ists who would op­press re­li­gious rights, take away guns and al­low an in­flux of for­eign­ers to fur­ther sup­press job prospects for the work­ing class.</p>
    <p>The white work­ing class thus saw in Mr Trump a way of get­ting their own back against the elite.</p>
    <p>POL­I­TICS OF PO­LAR­I­SA­TION</p>
    <p>In 1984, then Repub­li­can con­gress­man Newt Gin­grich took to the floor of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives be­fore TV cam­eras and launched into a scathing at­tack on his Demo­cratic col­leagues, and the lines of at­tack he used then would not sound out of place to­day.</p>
    <p>He ac­cused them of be­ing cor­rupt, of op­pos­ing school prayer and of be­ing “soft on Com­mu­nism”.</p>
    <p>He would go on to do the same over sev­eral nights for months with seem­ingly no dis­sent be­ing heard from the floor.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>Mr Gin­grich was speak­ing to an empty cham­ber dur­ing spe­cial evening ses­sions af­ter of­fi­cial busi­ness was con­cluded. He knew that be­cause the fixed cam­era in the room never panned away from the podium the watch­ing au­di­ence would as­sume the Democrats were there lis­ten­ing and did not or could not re­fute his charges.</p>
    <p>The gam­bit was part of a broader plan by Mr Gin­grich de­vised to help Repub­li­cans gain back con­trol of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, which in 1984 had been in con­tin­u­ous con­trol of Democrats for three decades.</p>
    <p>Be­liev­ing the party could not over­come the Democrats’ edge fight­ing one race at a time, he em­barked on a strat­egy to in­ten­sify public ha­tred of Congress to the point they would con­sider throw­ing out the ma­jor­ity of the dys­func­tional in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes es­tab­lish­ing many of the prac­tices a con­fronta­tional Congress is sad­dled with to­day.</p>
    <p>In their book about the rise of ex­trem­ism in Amer­i­can pol­i­tics, ti­tled It’s Even Worse Than It Looks, con­gres­sional schol­ars Thomas Mann and Nor­man Ornstein iden­tify Mr Gin­grich as the man who laid the foun­da­tion for pre­vi­ously un­think­able tac­tics like the now com­mon stand-offs over the na­tional bud­get for nar­row par­ti­san goals. He also turned a once col­le­giate at­mos­phere be­tween mem­bers of dif­fer­ent par­ties into one of con­fronta­tion.</p>
    <p>“His at­tacks on par­ti­san ad­ver­saries in the White House and Congress cre­ated a norm in which col­leagues with dif­fer­ent views be­came mor­tal en­e­mies,” they wrote.</p>
    <p>“He helped in­vent the mod­ern per­ma­nent cam­paign, al­low­ing elec­toral goals to dom­i­nate pol­icy ones; the use of over­heated rhetoric and ethics charges as po­lit­i­cal weapons; and the take-no-pris­oner pol­i­tics of con­fronta­tion and ob­struc­tion that have be­come the new nor­mal.”</p>
    <p>The au­thors also noted that as pol­i­tics grew more con­tentious, it pulled the elec­torate apart. For in­stance, stud­ies have shown that vot­ers are more po­larised than non-vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“Ac­tive and en­gaged Democrats and Repub­li­cans view the po­lit­i­cal world through such sharply dif­fer­ent lenses – with dif­fer­ent per­cep­tions of re­al­ity – that their world­views re­in­force the po­lar­i­sa­tion of their elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives,” they wrote.</p>
    <p>Part of the rea­son that po­lar­i­sa­tion trick­led down was be­cause it ap­peared to be in the best in­ter­est of politi­cians to get their sup­port­ers to be­lieve in the mal­ice of the other side.</p>
    <p>As Repub­li­can strate­gist Grover Norquist is known to have opined – at least be­hind closed doors – a po­larised elec­torate do­nated more money.</p>
    <p>The di­vid­ing force of pol­i­tics was re­in­forced by a slew of other fac­tors, in­clud­ing shift­ing de­mo­graph­ics in the United States. Re­dis­trict­ing and the eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment of the US south – along­side the pro­lif­er­a­tion of air-con­di­tion­ing which at­tracted more Repub­li­can-ori­ented se­nior cit­i­zens from the north who could now tol­er­ate the hot sum­mers – reshuf­fled the al­le­giances of both par­ties.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers who be­lieved the same things also started to live in the same neigh­bour­hoods, and both par­ties started to con­sist of politi­cians who were in greater ide­o­log­i­cal agree­ment.</p>
    <p>ME­DIA BUB­BLE</p>
    <p>In the 21st cen­tury, an­other di­vid­ing force started to make its pres­ence felt: me­dia.</p>
    <p>The po­lar­is­ing ef­fects of Face­book and Google al­go­rithms are well doc­u­mented – with par­ti­sans now able to largely in­habit very dif­fer­ent re­al­i­ties from one an­other with min­i­mal over­lap.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans would see only Repub­li­can-friendly con­tent and Democrats would see only Demo­crat-friendly con­tent.</p>
    <p>The adage “Ev­ery­one’s en­ti­tled to his own opin­ion, but not to his own facts” from Amer­i­can politi­cian Daniel Pa­trick Moyni­han no longer held. Now ev­ery­one was en­ti­tled to his own facts.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion went so far as to coin “al­ter­na­tive facts” and to nor­malise the char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion of un­favourable re­ports as “fake news”.</p>
    <p>And it wasn’t just that par­ti­sans had their own In­ter­net, they also had their own tele­vi­sion chan­nels. Fox News, founded in 1996 as a re­sponse to per­ceived lib­eral me­dia bias, came into its own in the 21st cen­tury and re­mains Amer­ica’s most-watched tele­vi­sion chan­nel.</p>
    <p>The ero­sion of a shared sense of re­al­ity meant the coun­try could not pull in the same di­rec­tion when it needed to, to solve a na­tional cri­sis. A large part of the rea­son the US did not ap­pear to have a na­tional strat­egy on Covid-19 this year is be­cause the coun­try could not agree on the ba­sic facts about the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On elec­tion day in the US, 82.8 per cent of Repub­li­cans ap­proved of Mr Trump’s han­dling of the pan­demic com­pared with just 6.4 per cent of Democrats, ac­cord­ing to data from poll anal­y­sis site FiveThir­tyEight.</p>
    <p>BRIDG­ING THE GAP</p>
    <p>The con­ven­tional wis­dom about how such gaps are bridged gen­er­ally set­tle on two things: di­a­logue and pa­tience.</p>
    <p>And that may well be the path for­ward af­ter this frac­tious elec­tion as well.</p>
    <p>As po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Charles Zelden from Nova South­east­ern Univer­sity in Florida noted, the sort of di­a­logue needed may not be pos­si­ble in the near fu­ture given the tone of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Right now there is a lot of anger. You see that in Lati­nos down here in Florida who are ab­so­lutely freaked by the idea that Bi­den is go­ing to pro­duce the sort of so­cial­ist hell that they left back home and this was a mes­sage sold to them by the Repub­li­can Party. That sort of fear-based re­sponse doesn’t make for good di­a­logue,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Un­til things set­tle down, per­haps af­ter a year or two of a suc­cess­ful Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, there is not go­ing to be a lot of room for com­pro­mise.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, the task is com­pli­cated by how Mr Trump has as­sailed the elec­toral process, claim­ing, with­out ev­i­dence, wide­spread fraud.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of Amer­i­cans are now primed to doubt the le­git­i­macy of the elec­tion race and Mr Trump will likely re­main in the public con­scious­ness even if he loses, given how close the race is.</p>
    <p>The time it will take be­fore the US set­tles down, if ever, will stretch out.</p>
    <p>For a watch­ing world, an Amer­ica at war with it­self is likely to be one that will be dis­tracted from its global role. That dis­trac­tion is nor­mally ex­pected in elec­tion years but the hang­over from 2020 is look­ing like it may take longer to re­cover from.</p>
    <p>Prof Zelden, how­ever, is con­vinced the ship will right it­self in the long run, point­ing to the na­tion’s pre­vi­ous in­ter­nal con­flicts, which in­clude a bloody civil war.</p>
    <p>“This is often a very nat­u­ral state for the US to be in. We have gone through a num­ber of pe­ri­ods of so­cial, po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion that have seen the par­ties rep­re­sent dif­fer­ing and op­pos­ing vi­sions of the fu­ture and, ul­ti­mately, one of those vi­sions be­comes dom­i­nant and things set­tle down af­ter a while. But in the process, things can get quite con­tentious.”</p>
    <p>(Mr Newt Gin­grich’s) at­tacks on par­ti­san ad­ver­saries in the</p>
    <p>White House and Congress cre­ated a norm in which col­leagues with dif­fer­ent views be­came mor­tal en­e­mies.</p>
    <p>CON­GRES­SIONAL SCHOL­ARS THOMAS MANN AND NOR­MAN ORNSTEIN, writ­ing about Repub­li­can Newt Gin­grinch (above) in their book on the rise of ex­trem­ism in Amer­i­can pol­i­tics, ti­tled It’s Even Worse Than It Looks.</p>
