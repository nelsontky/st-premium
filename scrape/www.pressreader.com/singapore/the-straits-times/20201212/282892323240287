    <p>It is no se­cret that the Lexus IS is aimed squarely at the BMW 3se­ries, ar­guably the bench­mark among com­pact per­for­mance pre­mium cars. And over time, Toy­ota’s lux­ury arm is get­ting closer and closer to its tar­get.</p>
    <p>The re­freshed IS300 is a case in point. It is a real stun­ner, with a brash spin­dle grille and bolder body mould­ings up­ping its sports quo­tient by sev­eral de­grees.</p>
    <p>Restyled lights back and front com­plete the facelift, putting more dis­tance be­tween this ju­nior Lexus sa­loon and the 3-se­ries in terms of road pres­ence.</p>
    <p>In­side, the car has more changes, in­clud­ing a 10.3-inch in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem which is at long last a touch­screen. This Ap­ple/An­droid­com­pat­i­ble sys­tem is a quan­tum leap from the pre­vi­ous cur­sor-style con­trol which had al­ways been a bit of a hit and miss.</p>
    <p>Adap­tive cruise con­trol and park­ing as­sist, along with driv­ing and safety fea­tures such as lan­e­trac­ing as­sist and pre-col­li­sion steer­ing as­sist, make the car bet­ter equipped than a sim­i­larly priced BMW 318i.</p>
    <p>Both are now pow­ered by a 2-litre turbo paired with an eight­speed au­to­box.</p>
    <p>The IS, how­ever, drives like a big­ger car, with its power plant churn­ing out its out­put (in­ci­den­tally, higher than the 318i’s) in a most creamy fash­ion. With­out look­ing at the specs, you would swear it was a six-cylin­der.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing rel­a­tively new to tur­bocharg­ing, Lexus has made the IS exquisitel­y smooth, re­fined</p>
    <p>and com­pletely lag-free – dou­bly re­in­forc­ing that big-car feel.</p>
    <p>The car is al­most the same size as its Bavar­ian ri­val, los­ing out by a lit­tle to its width and wheel­base. But per­for­mance-wise, the IS300 is streets ahead.</p>
    <p>It clocks a seven-sec­ond cen­tury sprint (ver­sus the 318i’s 8.4 sec­onds) and a top speed of 230kmh (223kmh).</p>
    <p>At the wheel, the Lexus is clearly the smoother per­former.</p>
    <p>At a re­laxed high­way pace, the en­gine is tick­ing just above idling and the car is lap­ping up the tar­mac with a pleas­ant hum.</p>
    <p>When driven more en­thu­si­as­ti­cally, the IS300’s dy­namism comes to the fore read­ily, with its su­perb steer­ing be­ing the big­gest dif­fer­en­tia­tor.</p>
    <p>Its quiet en­gine be­gins to emit a lovely growl at above 3,000rpm, and con­tin­ues to sound re­fined and un­flus­tered even past 5,000rpm.</p>
    <p>On this front, it matches the BMW’s ex­cel­lent man-ma­chine in­ter­face.</p>
    <p>Both ex­cel equally in ride and han­dling.</p>
    <p>Although quicker on pa­per, the Lexus does not feel markedly punchier than the 318i. Both cars are em­i­nently drive­able across a wide rev band, with the Lexus per­haps com­ing across as the more re­fined num­ber.</p>
    <p>What the Ja­panese fares less im­pres­sively in is ef­fi­ciency. It has a stated con­sump­tion of 7.5 litres/ 100km, ver­sus the 318i’s 5.8 litres/ 100km. In real life, the BMW av­er­ages 7.9 litres/100km, com­pared with the Lexus’ 11.5 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>This is sur­pris­ing, since Ja­panese cars are usu­ally more eco­nom­i­cal.</p>
    <p>But the Lexus, be­ing bet­ter equipped, is a heav­ier car. And when push comes to shove, the Lexus’ per­for­mance out­shines the Beemer’s.</p>
    <p>For some­thing un­der $200,000, both cars are equally palat­able.</p>
    <p>The 318i is the quin­tes­sen­tial 3, with buck­ets of verve and emo­tion, while the IS300 is a beauty with sporty sub­stance and un­par­al­leled smooth­ness.</p>
