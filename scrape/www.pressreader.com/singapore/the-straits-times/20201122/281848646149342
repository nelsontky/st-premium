    <p>WASH­ING­TON Michi­gan’s Repub­li­can state leg­isla­tive lead­ers said af­ter meet­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump that they had no in­for­ma­tion that would change the out­come of the presidenti­al elec­tion in the state, and would fol­low the “nor­mal” elec­toral process.</p>
    <p>Michi­gan is one of sev­eral states where the cam­paign of the Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent is seek­ing to chal­lenge Demo­crat Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory in the Nov 3 elec­tion, based on un­sub­stan­ti­ated claims of voter fraud.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment on Fri­day, Michi­gan Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mike Shirkey and House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Speaker Lee Chat­field said: “We have not yet been made aware of any i nfor­ma­tion that would change the out­come of the elec­tion in Michi­gan and as leg­isla­tive lead­ers, we will fol­low the law and fol­low the nor­mal process re­gard­ing Michi­gan’s elec­tors.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shirkey and Mr Chat­field said any al­le­ga­tion of elec­tion fraud should be thor­oughly in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>They added: “Michi­gan’s cer­ti­fi­ca­tion process should be a de­lib­er­ate process free from threats and in­tim­i­da­tion.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been stung by a se­ries of court de­feats, the Trump team is rest­ing its hopes on get­ting Repub­li­can-con­trolled leg­is­la­tures in bat­tle­ground states to set aside the re­sults and de­clare Mr Trump the win­ner, ac­cord­ing to three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the plan.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Fri­day’s meet­ing, White House spokesman Kayleigh McE­nany said: “This is not an ad­vo­cacy meet­ing. There will be no one from the cam­paign there. He rou­tinely meets with law­mak­ers from all across the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The two law­mak­ers said they also pressed for more funds for Michi­gan to deal with the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We used our time in the White House to de­liver a let­ter to Pres­i­dent Trump mak­ing clear our sup­port for ad­di­tional fed­eral funds to help Michi­gan in the fight against Covid-19,” they said.</p>
    <p>In Michi­gan’s Detroit city, Mr Trump and his cam­paign were ac­cused in a law­suit of threat­en­ing to dis­en­fran­chise hun­dreds of thousands of pre­dom­i­nantly black vot­ers in the city by pres­sur­ing lo­cal of­fi­cials to refuse to cer­tify Mr Bi­den as the elec­tion win­ner in Wayne County.</p>
    <p>“Cen­tral to this strat­egy is dis­en­fran­chis­ing vot­ers in pre­dom­i­nately black cities, in­clud­ing Detroit, by block­ing cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of elec­tion re­sults from those cities or coun­ties where they are lo­cated,” said the com­plaint by the Michi­gan Wel­fare Rights Or­gan­i­sa­tion filed late Fri­day in Wash­ing­ton fed­eral court.</p>
    <p>“De­fen­dants’ tac­tics re­peat the worst abuses in our na­tion’s his­tory, as black Amer­i­cans were de­nied a voice in Amer­i­can democ­racy for most of the first two cen­turies of the Repub­lic.”</p>
    <p>Ms Jenna El­lis, se­nior le­gal ad­viser to the Trump cam­paign, said the cam­paign’s goal is “to en­sure safe, se­cure and fair elec­tions”.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery Amer­i­can de­serves to know that our elec­tions are con­ducted in a le­gal man­ner, no mat­ter who they are or where they live,” she said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion cited Mr Trump’s meet­ing on Fri­day with Mr Shirkey and Mr Chat­field and his calls ear­lier last week to two GOP county can­vass­ing of­fi­cials in Wayne County.</p>
    <p>“Ex­ert­ing pres­sure on state and lo­cal of­fi­cials not to count or cer­tify vot­ers is pro­hib­ited” by fed­eral elec­tion law, said the com­plaint.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s bid to over­turn the elec­tion re­sult was dealt an­other blow on Fri­day af­ter it was an­nounced that he had lost Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gia Sec­re­tary of State Brad Raf­fensperger an­nounced that a man­ual re­count and au­dit of all bal­lots cast in the south­ern state had de­ter­mined that Mr Bi­den was the win­ner.</p>
