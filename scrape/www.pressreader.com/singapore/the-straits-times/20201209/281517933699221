    <p>LAUSANNE • Ath­letes at next year’s Tokyo Olympics will have a shorter than usual stay at the world’s big­gest multi-sports event due to tight Covid-19 health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) pres­i­dent Thomas Bach has urged na­tional Olympic com­mit­tees to adapt ath­letes’ and sup­port staff travel plans so that they do not ar­rive too early or stay too long in Ja­pan so as to min­imise the risk of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Na­tional Olympic com­mit­tees should adapt the ar­rival and de­par­ture poli­cies to en­sure that ath­letes can ar­rive five days prior to the start of the com­pe­ti­tion and de­part a max­i­mum two days after com­ple­tion of com­pe­ti­tion,” the Ger­man told a vir­tual news con­fer­ence on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“This ap­plies to each sport’s spe­cific of­fi­cials, not only ath­letes. Ex­cep­tions will be con­sid­ered sub­ject to cer­tain sport spe­cific cri­te­ria.”</p>
    <p>This means ath­letes com­pet­ing in the sec­ond week of the July 23-Aug 8 Olympics will not be present for the tra­di­tional pa­rade at the open­ing cer­e­mony of the Games, while those con­test­ing early will miss out on the clos­ing cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>The IOC added there would also be tighter con­trols on who can stay in the ath­letes’ vil­lage to pro­tect the com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has forced the un­prece­dented post­pone­ment of the Tokyo Games by a year.</p>
    <p>With more than 10,000 ath­letes from across the world ex­pected for the Games, there are fears that their ar­rival could cause a spike in Covid-19 cases, so au­thor­i­ties and or­gan­is­ers are keen to limit their move­ment out­side of com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, break­danc­ing, surf­ing, skate­board­ing and sports climb­ing have won spots at the next Olympics after the IOC rat­i­fied their in­clu­sion on Mon­day, Bach said.</p>
    <p>The Paris 2024 or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee had last year pro­posed the four sports for in­clu­sion and was wait­ing on a fi­nal re­view by the IOC’s ex­ec­u­tive board.</p>
    <p>Surf­ing, sports climb­ing and skate­board­ing are al­ready part of the Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>Paris or­gan­is­ers have said they want to de­liver a pro­gramme that is in keep­ing with the times and will at­tract a new and younger au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Un­der new IOC rules first in­tro­duced for Tokyo 2020, Olympic host cities can hand-pick sports and pro­pose them for in­clu­sion in those Games if these are pop­u­lar in that coun­try and add to the ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The IOC also trimmed the over­all events for Paris by 10 to 329 com­pared to the Tokyo Games, while in­creas­ing mixed gen­der events from 18 in Tokyo to 22.</p>
    <p>“With this pro­gramme, we are mak­ing the Olympic Games Paris 2024 fit for the post-corona world,” Bach said.</p>
    <p>“We are fur­ther re­duc­ing the cost and com­plex­ity of host­ing the Games. There is also a strong fo­cus on youth.”</p>
    <p>The IOC also capped the to­tal ath­lete quota at 10,500, while there will be a 50-50 split be­tween male and fe­male ath­letes in Paris, up from 48.8 per cent women in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>“While we will achieve gen­der equal­ity al­ready at the up­com­ing Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, we will see for the first time in Olympic his­tory the par­tic­i­pa­tion of the ex­act same num­ber of fe­male ath­letes as male ath­letes,” Bach said.</p>
    <p>Jean-Philippe Ga­tien, sports direc­tor for Paris 2024, added: “It’s a nice ref­er­ence to the 1900 Paris Olympics, when it was the first time that women were at the Games... It will be Games that are young, ur­ban and cre­ative.”</p>
