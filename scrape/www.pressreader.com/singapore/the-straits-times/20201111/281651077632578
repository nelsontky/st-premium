    <p>Sin­ga­pore is fa­mil­iar with the cold stor­age fa­cil­i­ties needed to store and dis­trib­ute vac­cines, the Min­istry of Health said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Ken­neth Mak, said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence by the Multi-min­istry Task­force on Covid-19 that Sin­ga­pore has ex­pe­ri­ence with this, thanks to its na­tional adult and child im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­gramme, which in­volves vaccinatin­g many in the pop­u­la­tion, in­clud­ing stu­dents at school.</p>
    <p>“We do have some fa­mil­iar­ity with the re­quire­ment for cold stor­age, both in stor­ing the vac­cines as they’re brought into the coun­try, and the lo­gis­tics re­quire­ments for main­tain­ing the cold chain as these vac­cines are trans­ported from one place to an­other,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Even at sites where we set up for vac­ci­na­tion, there will be var­i­ous re­quire­ments to en­sure that the vac­cine is pre­served in an op­ti­mal state prior to its use as well.”</p>
    <p>Prof Mak was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on whether Sin­ga­pore is equipped with the fa­cil­i­ties and in­fra­struc­ture needed to store and dis­trib­ute a vac­cine de­vel­oped by Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioN­Tech.</p>
    <p>Pfizer an­nounced on Mon­day that its can­di­date vac­cine has been found to be more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>But the novel vac­cine, which uses syn­thetic mes­sen­ger RNA to help the body im­mu­nise it­self against a virus, needs to be stored at a su­per-cold mi­nus 70 deg C, which could pose mas­sive lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenges to dis­tri­bu­tion and stor­age, even for coun­tries with so­phis­ti­cated health­care sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak said cold stor­age is one of the is­sues that the min­istry and an ex­pert com­mit­tee on vac­ci­na­tion set up last month are work­ing on.</p>
    <p>“We al­ready do have some cold stor­age fa­cil­i­ties that al­low us to be quite fa­mil­iar with the process of stor­ing vac­cines,” he said.</p>
    <p>“As we dis­cuss with the in­di­vid­ual phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies their vac­cine can­di­dates, some of the in­for­ma­tion we re­quest from them are specif­i­cally is­sues in re­la­tion to how their vac­cine should be stored and main­tained be­fore vac­ci­na­tion ac­tu­ally takes place.”</p>
    <p>If nec­es­sary, ad­di­tional cold stor­age fa­cil­i­ties may be set up in Sin­ga­pore, Prof Mak added.</p>
    <p>He said the min­istry and the ex­pert com­mit­tee are also “giv­ing some thought” to how the vac­cines will be trans­ported from place to place.</p>
