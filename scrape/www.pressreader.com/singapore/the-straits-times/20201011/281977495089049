    <p>More peo­ple left Tokyo than moved into the bustling Ja­panese cap­i­tal in re­cent months, a trend that ex­perts be­lieve will con­tinue with the ris­ing adop­tion of telecom­mut­ing.</p>
    <p>This comes as the pull of over-con­cen­trated Tokyo loosens with the cap­i­tal be­ing the epi­cen­tre of Ja­pan’s Covid-19 out­break. The city has a rolling seven-day av­er­age of 170 daily new cases as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This has spurred a de­sire among the Ja­panese to live closer to na­ture, some­thing fa­cil­i­tated by the ris­ing trend of telecom­mut­ing.</p>
    <p>More com­pa­nies are also re­lo­cat­ing from Tokyo.</p>
    <p>The out­flow, which bucks a longterm grad­ual in­flux of peo­ple into the cap­i­tal, has given rise to the term datsu tokyo (flee­ing Tokyo).</p>
    <p>Tokyo had 13.98 mil­lion res­i­dents as of Sept 1. This is a drop from the record high of 14 mil­lion on May 1.</p>
    <p>The pre­fec­tures of Chiba to the east, Kana­gawa to the south and Saitama to the north, which with Tokyo com­prise the Greater Tokyo re­gion, are pop­u­lar for their lower real es­tate prices, while be­ing rel­a­tively near the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>But there are also those who are mov­ing out of the Greater Tokyo re­gion al­to­gether. Nagano, which in­cludes the pop­u­lar re­sort town of Karuizawa, recorded a net in­flow of 750 peo­ple from Tokyo be­tween April and Au­gust.</p>
    <p>July also marked the first time the out­flow from the Greater Tokyo re­gion was greater than the in­flow, with a net drop of 1,459 peo­ple. This was fol­lowed by a net de­cline of 459 peo­ple in Au­gust, data shows.</p>
    <p>This trend is likely to gain pace, ex­perts say, as more com­pa­nies plan to shift op­er­a­tions out of Tokyo, tak­ing their em­ploy­ees with them.</p>
    <p>Hu­man re­sources firm Pa­sona Group will move 1,200 peo­ple, or two-thirds of those work­ing in the Tokyo head of­fice, to Awaji is­land in Hyogo pre­fec­ture by May 2024.</p>
    <p>Tech start-up Col­labo Style shifted to Nagoya in July, while another firm, In­for­ma­tion De­vel­op­ment, will be­gin a move to Yon­ago in Tot­tori pre­fec­ture this month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a Cabi­net Of­fice sur­vey in May and June showed that 25 per cent of those work­ing re­motely in the Tokyo area are keen to move to the coun­try­side.</p>
    <p>As part of a push to re­vive ru­ral re­gions, the govern­ment is of­fer­ing re­set­tle­ment pack­ages of up to one mil­lion yen (S$12,800) from next April to those who move to ru­ral ar­eas while telecom­mut­ing for a Tokyo firm.</p>
    <p>Dr Kei­ichiro Kobayashi, an economist with The Tokyo Foun­da­tion for Pol­icy Re­search think-tank, said that cheaper real es­tate, lower cost of liv­ing and the al­lure of na­ture out­side Tokyo might ap­peal to young fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>For those al­ready in ru­ral ar­eas, the adop­tion of tele­work has meant that they are able to take up jobs in Tokyo with­out hav­ing to re­lo­cate.</p>
    <p>This was the case with Mr Takahiro Ono, 43, who lives in Nara pre­fec­ture with his wife and two sons, aged 13 and 10, and be­gan work­ing in a com­mu­ni­ca­tions role at tech giant Fu­jitsu’s Tokyo head of­fice in July.</p>
    <p>“I thought I was go­ing to have to live sep­a­rately from my fam­ily. My wife needed to stay in Nara to care for her el­derly par­ents and we wanted our kids to be able to keep go­ing to their school,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“But now I can send my kids off to school, wel­come them home, and we eat break­fast and din­ner to­gether. I feel that I can get to see my kids grow­ing up.”</p>
