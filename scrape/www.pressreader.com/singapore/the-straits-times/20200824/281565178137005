    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s ad­min­is­tra­tion is set to re­open talks with Abu Dhabi to re­solve dis­putes over the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) case in a bid to mend strained bi­lat­eral ties.

    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s ad­min­is­tra­tion is set to re­open talks with Abu Dhabi to re­solve dis­putes over the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) case in a bid to mend strained bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein will lead a spe­cial govern­ment task force to Dubai this week in a bid to ham­mer out a com­pro­mise to a le­gal chal­lenge filed by Malaysia in a Lon­don court over the va­lid­ity of an ar­bi­tra­tion award that favoured state-owned en­ti­ties of Abu Dhabi that had deal­ings with 1MDB, fi­nan­cial ex­ec­u­tives and lawyers close to the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment of­fi­cials could not be reached for com­ment over the week­end.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian govern­ment’s fresh push for a set­tle­ment with Abu Dhabi comes just weeks af­ter Kuala Lumpur clinched a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar deal with global bank­ing gi­ant Gold­man Sachs Group over nu­mer­ous 1MDB-re­lated trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­ceived US$3.9 bil­lion (S$5.4 bil­lion) in the form of cash and guar­an­tees from the United States fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion, in ex­change for the coun­try drop­ping charges against the bank.</p>
    <p>But un­like the set­tle­ment with Gold­man Sachs, any deal with Abu Dhabi would be more com­plex be­cause of the many sen­si­tive as­pects of the dis­pute that would re­quire ma­jor con­ces­sions from both gov­ern­ments, said the fi­nan­cial ex­ec­u­tives and lawyers fa­mil­iar with the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Any set­tle­ment would have to be po­lit­i­cal be­cause both sides are not go­ing to make any ad­mis­sion of guilt,” said a former govern­ment of­fi­cial, who was di­rectly in­volved in the 1MDB saga, adding that</p>
    <p>Malaysia would push for a cer­tain amount of fi­nan­cial com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Malaysia and Abu Dhabi forged close ties dur­ing the pre­mier­ship of Na­jib Razak, who founded 1MDB shortly af­ter com­ing to power in April 2009. And state-owned cor­po­ra­tions con­trolled by Abu Dhabi, such as the In­ter­na­tional Pe­tro­leum In­vest­ment Com­pany (Ipic), soon be­gan forg­ing deals with their Malaysian coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>In 2012, Ipic guar­an­teed US$3.5 bil­lion of 1MDB bonds but that ar­range­ment turned into a debt pay­ment dis­pute be­tween the two gov­ern­ments. Ipic later sued 1MDB for de­fault­ing on its debt obli­ga­tions and both par­ties reached a set­tle­ment af­ter the dis­pute went into ar­bi­tra­tion in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>In that deal in 2017, Malaysia agreed to pay Abu Dhabi roughly US$1.2 bil­lion as set­tle­ment and as­sumed obli­ga­tions on the in­ter­est and prin­ci­pal pay­ments for the bonds that were guar­an­teed by Ipic.</p>
    <p>But all that changed af­ter the Na­jib-led Barisan Na­sional coali­tion was ejected from power in the coun­try’s his­toric May 2018 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The new Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion govern­ment filed a suit in Lon­don to chal­lenge the ar­bi­tra­tion set­tle­ment, ar­gu­ing that it was tainted by a “con­spir­acy to de­fraud”.</p>
    <p>Kuala Lumpur is de­mand­ing the re­cov­ery of US$3.5 bil­lion that it claims was paid to an Ipic sub­sidiary and wants a court or­der to re­duce its li­a­bil­ity to pay in­ter­est and prin­ci­pal for the bonds that were is­sued.</p>
    <p>Early this month, shortly af­ter reach­ing a set­tle­ment with Gold­man Sachs, At­tor­ney- Gen­eral Idrus Harun said the new govern­ment led by Tan Sri Muhyid­din was open to con­sid­er­ing all forms of a res­o­lu­tion with Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>Any set­tle­ment would have to be po­lit­i­cal be­cause both sides are not go­ing to make any ad­mis­sion of guilt. ’’ A FORMER MALAYSIAN GOVERN­MENT OF­FI­CIAL, who was di­rectly in­volved in the 1MDB saga. He added that Malaysia would push for a cer­tain amount of fi­nan­cial com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
