    <p>Less than a week af­ter his ar­rival in Jakarta, United States Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo may turn into a lame duck for­eign min­is­ter, along with his boss, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. But Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Joko “Jokowi” Wi­dodo will not un­der­es­ti­mate Mr Trump’s chances of re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther will he squander the op­por­tu­nity of In­done­sia-US de­fence co­op­er­a­tion that his De­fence Min­is­ter Prabowo Su­bianto has gained from his re­cent trip to Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, as well as all of</p>
    <p>Asean, needs a strong US mil­i­tary pres­ence in the re­gion, amid es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions in the re­gion, now that China has be­come more as­sertive in its claim over a large swathe of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, how­ever, never wants to form any se­cu­rity al­liance de­spite re­gional ri­val­ries. Now, the guest from Wash­ing­ton is seem­ingly en­gaged in an im­pos­si­ble mis­sion: to per­suade, or more pre­cisely, to pres­sure In­done­sia to work closely with the US in cor­ner­ing and iso­lat­ing China, which is In­done­sia’s most im­por­tant trad­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>The mis­sion comes as Wash­ing­ton’s global power and in­flu­ence are di­min­ish­ing, in part be­cause Mr Trump has slashed many fis­cal and eco­nomic in­cen­tives, while uni­lat­er­ally pun­ish­ing its al­lies and strate­gic part­ners. In Fe­bru­ary, for ex­am­ple, Wash­ing­ton of­fi­cially</p>
    <p>re­moved In­done­sia, South Korea, Thai­land, Sin­ga­pore and Viet­nam from the list of de­vel­op­ing and least-de­vel­oped coun­tries. This meant In­done­sia would no longer re­ceive spe­cial dif­fer­en­tial treat­ment avail­able in the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion Agree­ment on Sub­si­dies and Coun­ter­vail­ing Mea­sures. The pol­icy has def­i­nitely af­fected In­done­sia’s ex­ports to the US.</p>
    <p>It seems to me that Mr Trump is con­fi­dent he will beat his ri­val Joe Bi­den. There­fore, he has or­dered Mr Pom­peo to tour four coun­tries in the In­dian Ocean re­gion to tell them to stand be­hind him in the face of China.</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump loses, all the agree­ments and com­mit­ments reached dur­ing Mr Pom­peo’s visit to Jakarta could mean noth­ing. If he wins, Mr Bi­den will be pre­oc­cu­pied with a messy do­mes­tic sit­u­a­tion, es­pe­cially the dev­as­tat­ing im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Editorial</p>
    <p>The Is­land, Sri Lanka</p>
    <p>The United States pres­i­den­tial</p>
    <p>elec­tion is only a few days away. Why does Wash­ing­ton think Sri Lanka is so im­por­tant as to be vis­ited by no less than Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo at this par­tic­u­lar junc­ture?</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tion­ally, the US has its work cut out to counter grow­ing Chi­nese in­flu­ence. The US and its al­lies are with­out enough sur­plus funds to match China’s abil­ity to grant loans or un­der­take devel­op­ment projects around the world. They are par­tic­u­larly trou­bled by a gnaw­ing sense of in­se­cu­rity vis-a-vis China’s am­bi­tious Belt and Road project.</p>
    <p>Un­able to take on China for ob­vi­ous rea­sons, the US is turn­ing on soft tar­gets like Sri Lanka, which is de­pen­dent on Chi­nese aid, and has forged al­liances with other na­tions to shore up its di­min­ish­ing power. How much is it will­ing to grant Sri Lanka by way of fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance with­out ex­pect­ing any­thing in re­turn other than loan re­pay­ment? Can it match what Sri Lanka re­ceives from China as loans and grants?</p>
    <p>The US would not have had to throw its weight around in this man­ner if it had con­ducted it­self as a true world leader and tried to win over other na­tions in­stead of re­sort­ing to hos­tile ac­tion against them on some pre­text or the other.</p>
