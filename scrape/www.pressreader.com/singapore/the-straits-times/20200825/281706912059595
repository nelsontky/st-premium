    <p>More than 20 years af­ter it closed its doors to elected of­fi­cials and au­gust as­sem­blies, the Old Par­lia­ment House last night again came to life for the open­ing of the 14th Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Now called The Arts House, it was des­ig­nated the sec­ond venue for the event, in ad­di­tion to Par­lia­ment House, as part of safety mea­sures amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sig­nif­i­cance of the dual sit­ting was not lost on newly re­elected Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin.</p>
    <p>In his speech yes­ter­day, Mr Tan said: “There is a spe­cial sense of nos­tal­gia for many of the mem­bers – those of you in The Arts House – to be there in the same cham­ber tak­ing the oath as many of our pre­de­ces­sors did, when they pledged to serve Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans hon­ourably and faith­fully.</p>
    <p>“If I may be can­did, I think many of us here would have wished we were one of those that were des­ig­nated to be there this evening.”</p>
    <p>For those who were in the old cham­ber, it was a chance to soak in the nos­tal­gia and po­lit­i­cal his­tory the place is steeped in.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, in a Face­book post yes­ter­day, put up photos of the seat he sat in dur­ing the cer­e­mony. It was the seat once oc­cu­pied by for­mer health min­is­ter Ah­mad Ibrahim – who was in the first Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) Cab­i­net in 1959.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said: “The last time that elected Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment were sworn in at the Old Par­lia­ment House was in 1997, for the ninth Par­lia­ment. Join­ing pol­i­tics in 2011, I never ex­pected that I would be tak­ing my oath of al­le­giance here.”</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen, in a sep­a­rate Face­book post, put up a photo of the seat that for­mer deputy prime min­is­ter and PAP Old Guard leader Goh Keng Swee had once sat in. Dr Ng was sit­ting yes­ter­day in the seat be­side it.</p>
    <p>The area around both venues yes­ter­day was vir­tu­ally shut down un­der a se­cu­rity blan­ket and MPs started stream­ing in as early as 4.45pm – 45 min­utes be­fore the event was to start.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one made sure they sat at least one seat away from the next per­son. All were wear­ing masks, of course – but some seemed to be sport­ing a spe­cial edi­tion white mask fea­tur­ing a tiny logo of Par­lia­ment House.</p>
    <p>The Speaker, in his speech yes­ter­day, re­minded the MPs gath­ered in the two Houses that re­gard­less of their po­lit­i­cal stripes, they should not for­get that they are work­ing to­wards a com­mon pur­pose – to achieve bet­ter out­comes for Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>And while there will be pas­sion­ate and vig­or­ous de­bates on pol­icy is­sues and Bud­gets, Mr Tan chal­lenged MPs to show the world that such a ro­bust con­test of ideas can take place with­out be­ing frac­tious.</p>
    <p>He also cau­tioned against the “wide and easy path” to­wards po­lar­i­sa­tion and di­vi­sion, pop­ulism and “short-ter­mism”.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said Sin­ga­pore is now in a sit­u­a­tion where there are no text­book an­swers to fall back on.</p>
    <p>He said: “There will be dif­fi­cult and some­times un­pop­u­lar de­ci­sions to be made be­cause there are very real and gen­uine trade-offs that need to be un­der­taken.”</p>
    <p>Will the fo­cus be on so­lu­tions or pol­i­tick­ing, he asked. “All of you, all of us, will de­ter­mine what th­ese pos­si­ble out­comes would be,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that in this ses­sion of Par­lia­ment, there are 83 MPs from the rul­ing PAP, and a record 10 op­po­si­tion MPs from the Work­ers’ Party – the largest num­ber of elected op­po­si­tion mem­bers in re­cent his­tory.</p>
    <p>There are 31 newly elected MPs, as well as the newly cre­ated po­si­tion of Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>All of this re­flects a de­sire by Sin­ga­pore­ans for more voices and choices in Par­lia­ment, Mr Tan said.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing MPs to ful­fil their du­ties in keep­ing the Govern­ment ac­count­able, Mr Tan said he looked for­ward to see­ing all MPs present for every sit­ting, un­less they were in­volved in of­fi­cial du­ties or on ur­gent leave.</p>
    <p>As be­fit­ting a high­light of the po­lit­i­cal cal­en­dar, all the MPs came dressed in their for­mal best.</p>
    <p>MPs from both sides of the po­lit­i­cal aisle, as well the two Non-Con­stituency MPs from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP), took their oaths from both lo­ca­tions, and the cer­e­mony was live-streamed si­mul­ta­ne­ously to both venues.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, Mr Heng, and se­nior min­is­ters Teo Chee Hean and Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam all took the oath in­di­vid­u­ally, fol­lowed by other min­is­ters and min­is­ters of state in groups.</p>
    <p>The rest of the MPs took their oaths mostly in groups of four to eight peo­ple. NCMPs Hazel Poa and Leong Mun Wai from the PSP were sworn in last.</p>
    <p>There was a nod to di­ver­sity in the lan­guages used – Ms Ra­hayu Mahzam (Jurong GRC), Mr Mohd Fahmi Ali­man (Marine Pa­rade GRC) and Mr Faisal Manap (Alju­nied GRC) were among the five MPs who took the oath in Malay.</p>
    <p>Thir­teen MPs took the oath in Man­darin, in­clud­ing Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion and Man­power Gan Siow Huang (Mary­mount), Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong GRC) and Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC).</p>
    <p>Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC) was the only MP who took</p>
