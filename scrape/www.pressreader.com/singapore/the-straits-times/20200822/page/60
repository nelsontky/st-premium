        C14 | SATURDAY, AUGUST 22 , 2020 Essentials for easy living and working WFH outfit ideas By JUSTIN CHUA Bring out the pot of chamomile and slip right into that slightly oversized tee, get comfortabl­e, because the reality of working from home could be here to stay for some time. Being confined for a sustained period can alter the psyche, and it is important to maintain some semblance of a routine. So, here are a few work-from-home outfits that can be put together with ease. Push for that pullover Break out the pajamas Linen Nothing quite says snug than your trusty pullover. And if you happen to be working from an air-conditione­d home office, then opting for a pullover may suit you to a tee. How often do you get to send out important emails in good ol' PJs? Embrace this time. There are stylish yet comfortabl­e pajamas options out there that say: “I may be last night’s attire, but this look doesn’t have to retire.” Linen is one of the more lightweigh­t fabrics you can choose to stay cool in the tropical weather. Such natural, light fabrics tend to dry faster, which is always a bonus when you sweat.
