    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Bri­tain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have reached a set­tle­ment with a celebrity photo agency that took unau­tho­rised pic­tures of their young son at home, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments filed on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sus­sex filed a law­suit in July al­leg­ing that un­named paparazzi pho­tog­ra­phers had used drones and he­li­copters to take il­le­gal photos of their son, Archie, at the fam­ily’s pri­vate res­i­dence i n Cal­i­for­nia when he was 14 months old.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments filed with the Los An­ge­les County Su­pe­rior Court on Thurs­day said photo agency X17 had agreed to stop dis­tribut­ing the images, which showed Archie with his ma­ter­nal grand­mother in a gar­den at the fam­ily’s res­i­dence, and to turn over the orig­i­nal pic­tures and all copies.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, X17 said: “We apol­o­gise to the Duke and Duchess of Sus­sex and their son for the dis­tress we have caused.”</p>
    <p>It added: “We were wrong to of­fer these pho­to­graphs and com­mit to not do­ing so again.”</p>
    <p>The agency also agreed to pay a por­tion of the fam­ily’s le­gal fees, ac­cord­ing to Mr Michael Kump, an at­tor­ney for the couple.</p>
    <p>“This is a suc­cess­ful out­come,” Mr Kump said. “All fam­i­lies have a right, pro­tected by law, to feel safe and se­cure at home.”</p>
    <p>Meghan, Harry and Archie live in Los An­ge­les. The couple stepped down from their royal roles at the end of March to forge new ca­reers. They moved out of Bri­tain amid grow­ing hos­til­ity to the me­dia’s in­tense cov­er­age of their pri­vate life.</p>
