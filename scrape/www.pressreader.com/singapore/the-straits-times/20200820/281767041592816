    <p>The Ker­ala govern­ment’s de­ci­sion to col­lect the phone call records of Covid-19 pa­tients in the state has sparked con­cerns in In­dia about breaches of pri­vacy be­com­ing rou­tine dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On Aug 13, Mr Pi­narayi Vi­jayan, Chief Min­is­ter of the south­ern state, said that the po­lice were us­ing call de­tails to de­ter­mine how many peo­ple had come into con­tact with Covid-19 pa­tients. Ker­ala’s op­po­si­tion par­ties said that this “in­fringes on pa­tient pri­vacy”.</p>
    <p>The po­lice in many states col­lab­o­rate with health and mu­nic­i­pal­ity work­ers to trace con­tacts, en­force so­cial dis­tanc­ing and quar­an­tine rules, and man­age con­tain­ment zones. But state of­fi­cials now ad­mit that the po­lice may also be ac­cess­ing Covid-19 pa­tients’ call records.</p>
    <p>Ker­ala is not the only state us­ing phone records to trace where­abouts. Late last month, a 30-year-old in the Da­van­agere district of Kar­nataka was await­ing his Covid-19 test re­sults, when friends he fre­quently spoke to on the phone called him to say that state of­fi­cials had in­formed them he had tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The first known in­stance of call records be­ing ac­cessed in In­dia for the Covid-19 re­sponse was when the Andhra Pradesh govern­ment used the method to trace par­tic­i­pants of a Tab­lighi Ja­maat re­li­gious meet­ing in Delhi in March. Of­fi­cials col­lected call de­tails of all phones that were in Delhi’s Niza­mud­din neigh­bour­hood dur­ing the meet­ing, and traced more than 13,000 peo­ple who may have been ex­posed through­out the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“The Tab­lighi in­ci­dent seems to have set the pat­tern to treat pa­tients like crim­i­nals, and do con­tact trac­ing through any means,” said Mr T. Sun­darara­man, In­dia con­venor of the Peo­ple’s Health Move­ment.</p>
    <p>By law, the po­lice can col­lect call records only dur­ing a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion. But of­fi­cials in four states told The Straits Times that ac­cess­ing call data records was a nec­es­sary and ac­cepted method of con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>A Ch­hat­tis­garh state of­fi­cial who was in charge of the Covid-19 re­sponse said: “We ini­tially used call records to find the Tab­lighi Ja­maat peo­ple. But later we used them for other per­sons as well, when peo­ple mis­guided us about their where­abouts.”</p>
    <p>The Ut­tar Pradesh po­lice have been ac­cess­ing call records for months in Luc­know, Noida and Ghazi­abad dis­tricts. A se­nior po­lice­man there said: “There is no for­mal or gen­eral or­der about tak­ing call data, but if some­body has evaded quar­an­tine or run away, it is tan­ta­mount to a crime un­der the Epi­demic Dis­eases Act. In that case, po­lice col­lect call records.”</p>
    <p>Dr Amar Fet­tle, Ker­ala’s nodal of­fi­cer for Covid-19 ef­forts, said that the state ac­cessed call records as early as March to trace con­tacts of a fam­ily that had re­turned from Italy but had not re­vealed vi­tal in­for­ma­tion about their move­ments.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, the health depart­ment col­lected this call data. But later, the govern­ment gave the task to the po­lice. The feel­ing seems to be that peo­ple won’t re­veal their de­tails prop­erly to doc­tors and nurses and they will be more scared of a per­son in uni­form,” said Dr Fet­tle.</p>
    <p>Pri­vacy is a fun­da­men­tal right in In­dia, but the govern­ment has not yet passed a law to pro­tect it.</p>
    <p>Mr Apar Gupta, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of dig­i­tal rights group the In­ter­net Free­dom Foun­da­tion, said us­ing call records for con­tact trac­ing was wor­ry­ing.</p>
    <p>“It is op­er­a­tionalised through po­lice de­part­ments rather than health govern­ment of­fices… It lacks safe­guards such as pur­pose lim­i­ta­tions and, due to lack of any over­sight, has the po­ten­tial for be­ing used for ex­tra­ne­ous pur­poses,” said Mr Gupta.</p>
