    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The at­mo­spheric pat­tern stok­ing Cal­i­for­nia’s record­break­ing heat­wave this week has also played a role in caus­ing ex­treme light­ning storms that have sparked scores of wild­fires, weather and fire of­fi­cials have said.</p>
    <p>The surge in light­ning strikes – the most wide­spread burst of such storms in Cal­i­for­nia since 2008 – has come with very lit­tle rain, ratch­et­ing up an al­ready volatile wild­fire sea­son.</p>
    <p>As of Tues­day af­ter­noon, nearly 6,000 light­ning strikes were recorded dur­ing a sin­gle 24-hour stretch, ig­nit­ing more than 200 wild­fires from the San Fran­cisco Bay area north to Cal­i­for­nia’s Gold Coun­try, said Ms Lynette Round, a spokesman for the Cal­i­for­nia Depart­ment of Forestry and Fire Pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Light­ning also trig­gered a ma­jor blaze north of the famed Lake Ta­hoe re­sort city last Fri­day that has since charred more than 17,806 hectares – an area about one-tenth the size of Los An­ge­les – and un­leashed a rare cy­clone of flames called a fire tor­nado, or “fire­nado”, last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of kilo­me­tres to the south, a light­ning-caused blaze that started on Satur­day has scorched an­other 17,806-plus ha of dry grass and desert scrub on the floor of the Mo­jave Na­tional Pre­serve, which en­com­passes the world’s largest Joshua tree for­est and is the habi­tat of the threat­ened desert tor­toise.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som de­clared a statewide emer­gency on Tues­day to en­sure re­sources are avail­able to com­bat the fires.</p>
    <p>The heat wave was com­pli­cat­ing those ef­forts by adding to the des­ic­cated con­di­tion of veg­e­ta­tion fu­elling the flames, while also pos­ing a greater phys­i­cal chal­lenge to the fire­fight­ers.</p>
    <p>Ab­nor­mally high tem­per­a­tures that be­gan roast­ing Cal­i­for­nia last Fri­day, strain­ing the state’s power grid and lead­ing to rolling black­outs, are due to an enor­mous dome of high pres­sure hov­er­ing over Amer­ica’s desert South-west, weather of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The same high-pres­sure ridge was si­phon­ing off mois­ture from rem­nants of a now-dis­si­pated trop­i­cal storm off the coast of Mex­ico, creat­ing con­di­tions rife for thun­der­storms and light­ning strikes over cen­tral and north­ern Cal­i­for­nia, me­te­o­rol­o­gists said.</p>
    <p>Day­time highs have shat­tered records across the state, with the hottest air tem­per­a­ture recorded any­where on Earth dur­ing the last cen­tury reached in Death Val­ley Na­tional Park on Sun­day af­ter­noon, where the mer­cury soared to 54.4 de­grees Cel­sius. Rolling black­outs – short-term power cut­offs to pre­vent a larger col­lapse of the elec­tri­cal grid – briefly left over 400,000 homes and busi­nesses with­out air con­di­tion­ing over the week­end, the first such black­outs im­posed since 2001.</p>
