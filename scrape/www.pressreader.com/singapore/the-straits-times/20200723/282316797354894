    <p>MI­LAN • Cris­tiano Ron­aldo is eye­ing more records as Ju­ven­tus head to Udi­nese to­day with a ninth con­sec­u­tive Serie A ti­tle within their grasp.</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese for­ward scored a dou­ble on Mon­day against Lazio to bring his tally to 51 Serie A goals since join­ing the Turin side in July 2018.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old be­came the first player to achieve a half cen­tury of goals in Italy, Spain and Eng­land. He was also the fastest to reach the mark in Italy, in 61 games.</p>
    <p>Last year, the five-time Bal­lon d’Or win­ner scored 21 goals in his first sea­son in Italy but thanks to his brace against Lazio, he took his tally to 30 this term, with four games re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other goal would see him match the late Italy World Cup win­ner Felice Borel, who was the last player to score 31 goals for Ju­ven­tus in the 1933-34 sea­son.</p>
    <p>For Ron­aldo, the ti­tle of top scorer – “Capoc­an­non­iere” – is also up for grabs this cam­paign, as he is cur­rently level on 30 with Lazio’s Ciro Im­mo­bile.</p>
    <p>He could also over­take Bay­ern Mu­nich’s Robert Le­wandowski, the top scorer in Europe with 34 Bun­desliga goals, al­beit from just 34 league games. Each Serie A team plays 38 league games.</p>
    <p>There is also the record of Ar­gen­tinian team­mate Gon­zalo Higuain, who was Serie A’s top scorer un­der Mau­r­izio Sarri at Napoli in the 2015-16 sea­son with 36 goals.</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus (80 points) can seal the ti­tle with a win over 16th­placed Udi­nese, but it de­pends on In­ter Mi­lan, who are eight points be­hind the cham­pi­ons, los­ing to Fiorentina at the San Siro yesterday. Oth­er­wise they could win their 36th Scud­etto on Sun­day, at home against Sam­p­do­ria, giv­ing former banker Sarri, 61, his first league ti­tle.</p>
    <p>“We have to fin­ish this Serie A sea­son with the points we need to win, then get ready for an­other dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion (in the Cham­pi­ons</p>
    <p>MARKS IN RON’S SIGHTS</p>
    <p>With 30 Serie A goals this sea­son, joint top with Lazio’s Ciro Im­mo­bile, Cris­tiano Ron­aldo has a chance to make his­tory in the last four games.</p>
    <p>League),” the coach said on the club web­site.</p>
    <p>“I left the bank be­cause I was bored and had this pas­sion, hop­ing to make a liv­ing out of that pas­sion. Some­times in a ca­reer, you can be in the right place at the right time, so you do more than you ever in­tended.</p>
    <p>“After the Serie A, we have to fo­cus on the round of 16 to reach the fi­nal eight.”</p>
    <p>Juve will need to over­turn a 1-0 first-leg deficit against French club Lyon in the Cham­pi­ons League last 16 next month.</p>
    <p>More to beat Bay­ern Mu­nich’s Robert Le­wandowski (34 goals) as top scorer in Europe this term.</p>
