    <p>As mar­kets tum­bled this year, Ms Mary Ann Tsao faced a tough choice. Her fourth-gen­er­a­tion fam­ily of­fice in Sin­ga­pore had adopted sus­tain­able in­vest­ing prin­ci­ples, but the coro­n­avirus pan­demic was trash­ing the global econ­omy. Relatives sug­gested a re­turn to the old ways.</p>
    <p>“They’d say ‘ don’t l ose any money – never mind about the ESG (en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and cor­po­rate gov­er­nance)’,” Ms Tsao said. “But we have to ask: What is the pur­pose of in­vest­ing money in the first place?”</p>
    <p>In a sign of how Asia’s ul­tra-rich fam­ily of­fices are slowly em­brac­ing the sus­tain­abil­ity trend, the Tsao Fam­ily Of­fice has tried to stay the course, buy­ing into the Brown Ad­vi­sory US Sus­tain­able Growth Fund and adding to its in­vest­ment in the Robeco Sus­tain­able Euro­pean Stars Fund af­ter the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>For sus­tain­able in­vest­ing to take hold in Asia as it has started to in Europe and North Amer­ica, fam­ily of­fices like Ms Tsao’s are key. Fam­i­lies run 85 per cent of Asia’s busi­nesses, ac­cord­ing to Ernst & Young es­ti­mates, a much higher pro­por­tion than the rest of the world. As for­tunes get passed on to next gen­er­a­tions, the push to do well by do­ing good is gath­er­ing steam.</p>
    <p>“Fam­ily-owned com­pa­nies within an Asian per­spec­tive are much more sig­nif­i­cant for lo­cal economies than they are in Europe or in the US,” said Mr Eu­gene Klerk, global head of en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance re­search at Credit Suisse Group in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>De­bates like the Tsaos are hav­ing are tak­ing place over the vir­tual din­ner ta­bles of many ty­coon fam­i­lies and could help shape the fu­ture of ESG in­vest­ment, which ex­ceeds US$30 tril­lion (S$41 tril­lion) glob­ally. While sus­tain­able in­vest­ing has been gain­ing trac­tion, Covid-19 has forced many fam­i­lies to make stark choices: fun­nel money into op­er­at­ing busi­nesses to prevent col­lapse, re­vert to tried and true in­vest­ments or stay the green course.</p>
    <p>For the Tsaos, whose wealth was gen­er­ated by ship­ping lines that con­nect the globe, adopt­ing ESG in­vest­ing came af­ter lengthy dis­cus­sions with fam­ily mem­bers from the United States and Ja­pan to China. The fam­ily of­fice runs part of the for­tune cre­ated by Ms Tsao’s late fa­ther Frank Tsao and his In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Car­ri­ers, which even­tu­ally be­came IMC Group.</p>
    <p>As part of the push, it is of­fload­ing some fac­to­ries in China that no longer fit the cri­te­ria and has backed an im­pact in­vest­ment for a well­ness re­treat in China founded by a fam­ily mem­ber.</p>
    <p>It also pro­vided corner­stone cap­i­tal to the Welling­ton Global Im­pact Bond Fund and the In­vesco US Se­nior Loan ESG Fund.</p>
    <p>Among su­per-wealthy fam­i­lies, much of the change has been driven by the next wave of heirs – es­pe­cially mil­len­ni­als and women – who are try­ing to re­align fam­ily wealth with their per­sonal in­ter­ests and so­cial val­ues, ac­cord­ing to Mr Peter Golovsky, head of IQEQ’s Asia pri­vate wealth team from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>In Asia “you’ve got 2,000 fam­i­lies with more than US$500 mil­lion tran­si­tion­ing from one gen­er­a­tion to the next in the next 10 years”, he said. “It’ll cre­ate a fun­da­men­tal shift in the way they in­vest the fu­ture l ega­cies and i nvest­ments on be­half of those fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>Mr Golovsky re­lates the story of a pri­vate eq­uity client that ap­proached an Asian fam­ily for money, only to have the ta­bles turned. They were asked in­stead to cre­ate an ESG fund fo­cused on so­cial in­fra­struc­ture and tech­nol­ogy that im­proves clean wa­ter and agri­cul­ture. Once that was started, other fam­i­lies joined to make it a US$500 mil­lion ve­hi­cle. It is a strat­egy the Tsaos have also used.</p>
    <p>“It shows the in­flu­ence of what fam­i­lies and fam­ily of­fices can be do­ing in driv­ing spe­cific out­comes,” Mr Golovsky said.</p>
    <p>Other fam­ily of­fices are tar­get­ing their op­er­at­ing com­pa­nies for change. Ishk To­laram Foun­da­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Su­mi­tra Aswani, a fourth-gen­er­a­tion heir whose bil­lion­aire fam­ily ex­panded a tai­lor shop in In­done­sia into the To­laram Group, i nstalled com­bined heat and power sys­tems at its Es­to­nian pa­per op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>It has also adopted so­lar hy­brid tech­nolo­gies at a Nige­rian noo­dle fac­tory and in­te­grated ESG over­lays into its fam­ily of­fice in­vest­ments at Maitri As­set Man­age­ment. There are no plans to change course de­spite Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Much of the ev­i­dence shows that in­vestors who stuck by ESG funds this year have ben­e­fited. In June, Morn­ingstar re­ported that the ma­jor­ity of Europe-domi­ciled sus­tain­able funds it tracked had out­per­formed their old-school peers over mul­ti­ple time hori­zons and gen­er­ally held up bet­ter than their tra­di­tional coun­ter­parts dur­ing the Covid-19 sell-off.</p>
    <p>Rich in­vestors are tak­ing note. Mr Mario Knoepfel, head of sus­tain­able and im­pact in­vest­ing ad­vi­sory for Asia-Pa­cific at UBS Group, said the bank’s 100 per cent sus­tain­able port­fo­lio as­sets in the re­gion more than tripled to US$1.5 bil­lion in July, from US$405 mil­lion in Jan­uary last year. The num­ber of Asi­aPa­cific pri­vate bank­ing and wealth man­age­ment clients en­gaged in the port­fo­lio rose by 50 per cent in the first seven months of the year.</p>
    <p>North-East Fam­ily Of­fice man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Mette Ekeroth, whose em­ployer is based in Den­mark and Sin­ga­pore and man­ages the wealth of Pan­dora’s founders Win­nie Lil­je­borg and Per Al­got Enevold­sen, said Covid-19 has supported their long-term the­sis on sus­tain­able in­vest­ing. When they sensed the mar­ket was over­val­ued, they cut their over­all eq­uity ex­po­sure, fo­cus­ing on health­care and tech­nol­ogy to gen­er­ate strong re­turns this year.</p>
    <p>The gains al­lowed t he firm, which man­ages about US$3 bil­lion and whose founders had close ties to Thai­land, to make more im­pact in­vest­ments with the bless­ing of fam­ily mem­bers who check in ev­ery week for two-hour calls.</p>
    <p>“This is a jour­ney we’ve only just be­gun,” Ms Ekeroth said, adding that the pan­demic had acted as a bea­con for the space. “It’s high­lighted a fragility in the fi­nan­cial sys­tem but also high­lighted fragility in so­ci­ety.”</p>
