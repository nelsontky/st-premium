    <p>The chal­lenges con­fronting the global avi­a­tion sec­tor amid Covid-19 will con­tinue for the fore­see­able fu­ture, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata).</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try group noted last week that the re­cov­ery in pas­sen­ger traf­fic has been slower than ex­pected as the coro­n­avirus rages in cities world­wide.</p>
    <p>Global pas­sen­ger num­bers this year are ex­pected to de­cline by 55 per cent com­pared with last year, worse than the 46 per cent fore­cast in April, Iata said.</p>
    <p>Num­bers will not re­turn to preCovid-19 lev­els un­til 2024, a year later than what was pre­vi­ously pro­jected, it said.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive and di­rec­tor-gen­eral Alexan­dre de Ju­niac said: “Pas­sen­ger traf­fic hit bot­tom in April, but the strength of the up­turn has been very weak.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­na­tional mar­kets re­main largely closed... And in many parts of the world, in­fec­tions are still ris­ing. All of this points to a longer re­cov­ery pe­riod and more pain for the in­dus­try and the global econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Iata noted that there is lit­tle sign of virus con­tain­ment in many im­por­tant emerg­ing economies.</p>
    <p>Th­ese economies, to­gether with the United States, make up about 40 per cent of the global air travel mar­ket. Their con­tin­ued clo­sure, par­tic­u­larly to in­ter­na­tional travel, has sig­nif­i­cantly slowed re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>It added that weak con­sumer con­fi­dence, along with re­duced busi­ness travel, will fur­ther ham­per the in­dus­try’s ef­forts to re­cover.</p>
    <p>Iata said: “While his­tor­i­cally, GDP growth and air travel have been highly cor­re­lated, sur­veys sug­gest this link has weak­ened, par­tic­u­larly with re­gard to busi­ness travel, as video con­fer­enc­ing ap­pears to have made sig­nif­i­cant in­roads as a sub­sti­tute for in-per­son meet­ings.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have warned that the slow re­cov­ery will lead to in­evitable job cuts, given that most air­lines are now over­staffed.</p>
    <p>Some air­lines have al­ready started slash­ing jobs, with more ex­pected to fol­low in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong car­rier Cathay Pa­cific re­cently of­fered early re­tire­ment to cer­tain pi­lots. This is on top of short-term mea­sures, in­clud­ing ex­ec­u­tive pay cuts and two rounds of a vol­un­tary spe­cial leave scheme.</p>
    <p>Cathay is un­der­tak­ing a com­pre­hen­sive re­view of all its op­er­a­tions, with rec­om­men­da­tions on the fu­ture size and shape of the air­line ex­pected by the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant job cuts have also taken place in the Mid­dle East, where car­ri­ers were boom­ing be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The BBC re­ported that Dubaibased Emi­rates is set to cut as many as 9,000 po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Qatar Airways has also warned of sub­stan­tial job losses and has im­ple­mented pay cuts.</p>
