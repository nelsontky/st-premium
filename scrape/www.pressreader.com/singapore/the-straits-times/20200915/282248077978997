    <p>• Petro­chem­i­cals gi­ant Ineos has no in­ter­est in tak­ing over For­mula One cham­pi­ons Mercedes, team principal Toto Wolff said on Sun­day in re­sponse to a me­dia re­port.</p>
    <p>The Mail on Sun­day, quot­ing for­mer F1 team boss Ed­die Jor­dan, re­ported that Bri­tish bil­lion­aire Jim Ratcliffe’s com­pany was close to sign­ing a £700 mil­lion (S$1.2 bil­lion) deal for mo­tor sport’s dom­i­nant team.</p>
    <p>Jor­dan said the team would be called Ineos, with Mercedes re­tain­ing a 30 per cent share and Wolff, cur­rently a share­holder, no longer in charge.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple pick up bits and pieces and con­struct a story around it,” said the Aus­trian when asked about the re­port at the Tus­can Grand Prix in Italy, where his driv­ers, Lewis Hamil­ton and Valt­teri Bot­tas, se­cured a one-two fin­ish for the third time this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“(Mercedes par­ent) Daim­ler has no in­tent in giv­ing up the team and Ineos has no in­ter­est in buy­ing a ma­jor­ity of the team and call­ing it like this, and I have no rea­son to de­part from my share­hold­ing. So plenty of things that are made up.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture of the team is ab­so­lutely clear. It’s the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 team and noth­ing is go­ing to change that.”</p>
    <p>Mercedes work with Ineos, a principal F1 part­ner, on a num­ber of high-tech projects such as yacht­ing’s Amer­ica’s Cup and pro­fes­sional cy­cling.</p>
    <p>Ineos be­came the owner of Britain’s hugely suc­cess­ful Tour de France-win­ning Team Sky last year, chang­ing the name to Ineos Gre­nadiers.</p>
    <p>Its principal part­ner­ship with Mercedes in F1 is one rung be­low ti­tle spon­sor­ship.</p>
    <p>Wolff has yet to clar­ify his role with the Mercedes team for next year and be­yond. He has hinted that he would likely re­main with the Bri­tish-based Ger­man out­fit but could be in a dif­fer­ent po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Au­tosport pre­vi­ously re­ported that he could move to an­other role within the team that will give him more free­dom not to at­tend races and al­low him to bet­ter manage his time.</p>
