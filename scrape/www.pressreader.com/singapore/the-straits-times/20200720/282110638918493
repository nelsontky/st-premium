    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has wreaked havoc on busi­nesses on sev­eral fronts, from dis­rupt­ing sup­ply chains to caus­ing de­mand to plunge and bot­tom lines to shrink.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies, how­ever, have man­aged to turn the cri­sis into op­por­tu­ni­ties to re­or­gan­ise their oper­a­tions or up­skill their staff so that they would be among the first to cap­ture re­cov­ery when it comes around.</p>
    <p>At a Skill­sFu­ture Fo­rum last Fri­day, in­dus­try lead­ers shared ex­am­ples of how their com­pa­nies have tapped re­train­ing and tech­nol­ogy to mit­i­gate the fall­out from the pub­lic health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>MR CHOE PENG SUM</p>
    <p>The ho­tel in­dus­try is known for be­ing very labour in­ten­sive and the Covid-19 pan­demic has given the Pan Pa­cific Ho­tels Group the op­por­tu­nity to relook its or­gan­i­sa­tional struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“Just at the front desk, you have the se­cu­rity, bell­man, door­man, concierge, re­cep­tion, re­cep­tion man­agers... Can you imag­ine shrink­ing it all into one po­si­tion and call­ing it a client re­la­tion ex­ec­u­tive or guest re­la­tions of­fi­cer? That has to be done in our kind of busi­ness,” said Mr Choe.</p>
    <p>The process is known as de­lay­er­ing, he said, adding that it is a dif­fi­cult but cru­cial as­pect in re­think­ing a ho­tel’s op­er­at­ing model.</p>
    <p>“It needs a lot of reskilling, it needs a lot of job re­design,” said Mr Choe.</p>
    <p>He shared the ex­am­ple of hav­ing a cen­tral reser­va­tions depart­ment for the rooms and a sep­a­rate one for the restau­rants. The de­part­ments were merged into an all-en­com­pass­ing en­tity and the af­fected staff were able to step up to their new role with re­train­ing.</p>
    <p>The ho­tels in the group also un­der­went ren­o­va­tion and re­design to keep up with im­proved work pro­cesses after de­lay­er­ing, in­creas­ing the ap­pli­ca­tion of tech­nol­ogy and reskilling of em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“We closed down a lot of our ho­tels to ren­o­vate be­cause it’s not just about the reskilling of staff,” said Mr Choe.</p>
    <p>MS SU­SAN CHONG</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore raised the Disease Out­break Re­sponse Sys­tem Con­di­tion (Dorscon) level to or­ange in Fe­bru­ary, pack­ag­ing com­pany Green­pac con­tin­ued to ful­fil its sup­ply chain, en­sur­ing that its clients still re­ceived their equip­ment.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the com­pany had bud­geted about $500,000 to move its SAP soft­ware to a cloud plat­form, thus al­low­ing its staff to work from home eas­ily dur­ing Dorscon or­ange, a sit­u­a­tion in which the coro­n­avirus out­break was deemed to have mod­er­ate to high pub­lic health im­pact but was still un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>“Sixty per cent of our cus­tomers are from the med­i­cal in­dus­try. We pack equip­ment such as res­pi­ra­tors, ven­ti­la­tors and DNA­analysing equip­ment. So it be­comes very crit­i­cal and es­sen­tial,” said Ms Chong.</p>
    <p>“With­out pack­ag­ing, none of the equip­ment will move.”</p>
    <p>She added that the com­pany saw busi­ness op­por­tu­nity in the cri­sis – it ac­quired seven new clients in May, when cir­cuit breaker mea­sures to stem the spread of Covid-19 were still in force.</p>
    <p>MR TOBY KOH</p>
    <p>When the com­pany started us­ing Amer­i­can soft­ware firm Sales­force’s cloud plat­form to im­prove ef­fi­ciency, it was dif­fi­cult for em­ploy­ees to un­der­stand the value of learn­ing how to use the plat­form.</p>
    <p>“Chang­ing peo­ple’s mind­set is the tough­est thing I have ever tried to do. But at the end of the day, it’s about con­vinc­ing the team that there is value in that change,” said Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>The staff even­tu­ally saw the ben­e­fits of up­skilling, the great­est of which be­ing con­ve­nience for them.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh shared that in the past, when an em­ployee went to meet a client and re­alised that he did not have cer­tain in­for­ma­tion, he had to rush back to the of­fice to re­trieve that piece of in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>With a cloud plat­form, how­ever, the em­ployee could im­me­di­ately ac­cess the in­for­ma­tion with­out go­ing back to the of­fice.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, he could fin­ish his tasks and get off work early.</p>
    <p>“From the com­pany’s per­spec­tive, it gave us a lot more flex­i­bil­ity as well as busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity,” said Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>MS ADE­LINE SIM</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has thrown em­ploy­ees and em­ploy­ers a curve ball in the form of work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>For bosses, con­cerns in­clude how to con­duct ef­fec­tive meet­ings via video-con­fer­enc­ing tools such as Zoom.</p>
    <p>For work­ers, a ma­jor chal­lenge is how to ap­pear pro­fes­sional in their home en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“In the com­fort of your home, how do you en­sure that your vir­tual back­ground is switched on and your kids are not dis­rupt­ing your meet­ings?” said Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>“This sounds very mun­dane but there’s ac­tu­ally train­ing that has to be done in or­der to project your­self pro­fes­sion­ally dig­i­tally.”</p>
    <p>While an em­ployee’s work per­for­mance is usu­ally driven by re­sults, Ms Sim thinks that per­sonal de­vel­op­ment is also im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>She gets her teams to set aside 10 per cent of their key per­for­mance in­di­ca­tor for per­sonal de­vel­op­ment and they have to share what cour­ses they have at­tended, as well as what they have learnt.</p>
    <p>Staff also re­ceive cross-func­tional train­ing by par­tic­i­pat­ing in three projects ev­ery year that would equip them with dif­fer­ent skills. This en­ables them to step up to fill their col­league’s role if needed.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that’s the way to go, your learn­ing has to be con­tin­u­ous,” said Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>Melissa Yip</p>
    <p>MR CHOE PENG SUM</p>
    <p>Mr Choe is re­spon­si­ble for the ex­pan­sion of the group’s ho­tels and serviced apart­ments un­der the Pan Pa­cific and Parkroyal brands, and their per­for­mance, oper­a­tions, mar­ket­ing and brand stan­dards.</p>
    <p>With more than 33 years of ex­pe­ri­ence in the hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try, Mr Choe over­sees nearly 50 prop­er­ties with 14,000 keys across 27 cities in the Asia-Pa­cific, Europe and North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>When he was the CEO of Frasers Hos­pi­tal­ity In­ter­na­tional, Mr Choe grew the port­fo­lio from two prop­er­ties in Sin­ga­pore in 1998 to more than 140 prop­er­ties across some 76 cities world­wide. His last ap­point­ment was se­nior ad­viser to Frasers Prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Mr Choe started his hos­pi­tal­ity ca­reer in 1981 with Shangri-La In­ter­na­tional, which was man­aged by the Westin group at that time. He was awarded the ShangriLa over­seas schol­ar­ship and went to the United States.</p>
    <p>He grad­u­ated from Cor­nell Univer­sity and was awarded the Na­tional Dean’s List (USA), as well as the Phi Kappa Phi for aca­demic ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>MS SU­SAN CHONG</p>
    <p>Launched in 2002, Green­pac has grown from a one-per­son start-up to a mar­ket leader for en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly pack­ag­ing so­lu­tions in Asia that serves For­tune 500 firms.</p>
    <p>Green­pac cus­tomises so­lu­tions to help com­pa­nies re­duce wastage and in­crease their cost sav­ings, as busi­nesses be­come more aware of the need to re­duce their car­bon foot­print for a sus­tain­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The firm ranked fourth in the 2008 En­ter­prise 50 Awards in Sin­ga­pore and has a win­ning streak in the WorldS­tar Pack­ag­ing Award since 2009. It was also awarded the Sin­ga­pore Qual­ity Award in 2014 by the then Spring Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong, an alum­nus of Har­vard Busi­ness School, was awarded the EY En­tre­pre­neur of the Year by Ernst & Young Sin­ga­pore in 2014.</p>
    <p>MR TOBY KOH</p>
    <p>The com­pany is a lead­ing provider of se­cu­rity and busi­ness man­age­ment so­lu­tions to more than 8,000 in­sti­tu­tional, com­mer­cial and gov­ern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tions across Asia.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh led the group in win­ning the 2015 Sin­ga­pore Pres­tige Brand Award (Her­itage Brand) and the En­ter­prise 50 Award in 2015, 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>With his con­tri­bu­tions to de­vel­op­ments in Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity land­scape, Mr Koh was the over­all win­ner of the 2017 En­tre­pre­neur Of The Year Award (Es­tab­lished En­tre­pre­neur) and the 2013 Honouree of the Spirit of En­ter­prise Award.</p>
    <p>MS ADE­LINE SIM</p>
    <p>Ms Sim iden­ti­fies and ex­e­cutes in­vest­ments and ac­qui­si­tions as a mem­ber of the main­board-listed re­cruit­ment firm’s in­vest­ment com­mit­tee, on top of lead­ing strate­gic and tac­ti­cal ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>She also over­sees the tech­nol­ogy, dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing, in­vestor re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tion func­tions, as well as pro­vides coun­sel and guid­ance on le­gal mat­ters across 30 busi­ness units in 13 cities.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim has a Bach­e­lor of Laws de­gree from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore. She is a so­lic­i­tor of the Supreme Court of Eng­land and Wales, as well as a di­rec­tor of the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Prior to join­ing HRnetGroup in 2008, Ms Sim was a lawyer at Drew & Napier, where she en­gaged in dis­pute res­o­lu­tion and cap­i­tal mar­kets work.</p>
    <p>MR ONG TZE-CH’IN</p>
    <p>Mr Ong is re­spon­si­ble for driv­ing the Skill­sFu­ture na­tional move­ment that pro­vides Sin­ga­pore­ans with op­por­tu­ni­ties for life­long learn­ing. Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore is a statu­tory board un­der the MOE.</p>
    <p>He is also a mem­ber of the boards of Work­force Sin­ga­pore, Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute and Learn­ing Gate­way, and a mem­ber of the govern­ing board of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong started his ca­reer at the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces, be­com­ing a brigadier-gen­eral after al­most 25 years of ser­vice.</p>
