    <p>A bank­rupt turned to a busi­ness­man for a loan to an­nul his bank­ruptcy so that he can sue his brother over a prop­erty dis­pute.</p>
    <p>In all, Mr Rakesh Ku­mar Sharma, 57, got a loan to­talling $316,750 from Mr Kor Yong Koo.</p>
    <p>Mr Rakesh, how­ever, lost the suit against his 61-year-old brother Ashok and his wife and was or­dered to pay $156,000 in le­gal costs to the cou­ple.</p>
    <p>He did not, and last month, Mr</p>
    <p>Kor – a non-party to the law­suit – was or­dered to pay the amount by the High Court.</p>
    <p>Justice Kan­nan Ramesh, in his judg­ment grounds, said: “There is no hid­ing the fact that Mr Rakesh was a bank­rupt when Mr Kor first started dis­burs­ing monies to him.”</p>
    <p>He added: “This prima fa­cie meant that Mr Rakesh had lit­tle, if any, means of re­pay­ing the loan un­less one ac­counted for the re­cov­ery from (the law­suit). Mr Kor knew that.”</p>
    <p>The judge made clear that Mr Kor was li­able as he fur­nished the funds “for the pur­pose of ob­tain­ing a profit from the fruits of the lit­i­ga­tion”, based on the facts of the case.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther said that Mr Kor’s po­si­tion was dif­fer­ent from a lender who ex­tends gen­eral-pur­pose in­ter­est-bear­ing loans to peo­ple with lit­tle or no money who then use the funds to fi­nance lit­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Such lenders, un­like Mr Kor, should not be li­able to bear the lit­i­ga­tion costs, he added.</p>
    <p>But in Mr Kor’s case, the judge noted that he sought to re­cover ex­or­bi­tant prof­its as shown by the 30 per cent an­nual in­ter­est rate on the loan.</p>
    <p>Hence, he could not be deemed a</p>
    <p>“pure fun­der”, said Justice Kan­nan in his oral judg­ment.</p>
    <p>The judge found that the ba­sis for giv­ing the loans hinged on the money be­ing re­cov­ered from the out­come of Mr Rakesh’s law­suit (Suit 963) against his brother, with the in­ter­est rate de­signed for Mr Kor to en­joy a share of the pro­ceeds.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cord­ingly, I find that Mr Kor had the req­ui­site ‘close con­nec­tion’ with Suit 963,” Justice Kan­nan said.</p>
    <p>The saga be­gan in Oc­to­ber 2013, when Mr Rakesh was made a bank­rupt for the sec­ond time.</p>
    <p>In 2014, he asked Mr Kor for the loan to travel to In­dia to stake his claim on his father’s prop­er­ties there and to start lit­i­ga­tion against his brother Ashok and his wife in re­la­tion to his in­her­i­tance.</p>
    <p>Mr Kor, whose business is in ship chan­dling and tex­tiles, gave $100,000 ini­tially to clear the sec­ond bank­ruptcy and agreed to fur­ther sums at a monthly in­ter­est rate of 2.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Rakesh had his two bank­rupt­cies an­nulled in 2015.</p>
    <p>In May 2017, he lost his suit and when he did not pay the $156,000 in costs, Mr Ashok made him a bank­rupt and, through his lawyer Mah­mood Gaz­navi, sued Mr Kor for the money.</p>
    <p>Mr Kor’s lawyers, Mr Rabi Ah­mad and Ms Var­sha Kr­ish­nan, coun­tered that he was a dis­in­ter­ested party who gave a per­sonal loan to be re­paid with in­ter­est, re­gard­less of the out­come of Suit 963.</p>
    <p>Justice Kan­nan found that the ev­i­dence showed the prospect of Mr Rakesh re­pay­ing the loan was “in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked to the suc­cess of Suit 963. By pro­vid­ing funds to an­nul both bank­rupt­cies, Mr Kor re­moved the only ob­sta­cle to Mr Rakesh com­menc­ing Suit 963”.</p>
