    <p>A petite woman with a big ap­petite, South Korean YouTu­ber Tzuyang amassed a fol­low­ing of more than 2.6 mil­lion sub­scribers for her livestream eat­ing shows, fa­mously gob­bling down 240 chobab (Korean for sushi) and 1.5kg worth of yukhoe (sea­soned raw beef) in dif­fer­ent episodes.</p>
    <p>Early last month, how­ever, the 24-year-old quit YouTube abruptly after be­ing bom­barded on­line for de­ceiv­ing view­ers. Tzuyang, whose real name is Park Jeong-won, was one of sev­eral South Korean YouTu­bers ac­cused of hid­ing prod­uct place­ments in their videos.</p>
    <p>The snow­balling con­tro­versy has since prompted the Korea Fair Trade Com­mis­sion (KFTC) to ban what is known as “back­door on­line ad­ver­tis­ing” from Sept 1, re­quir­ing all so­cial me­dia in­flu­encers to state clearly that they are pro­mot­ing a spon­sored prod­uct or ser­vice.</p>
    <p>A video on YouTube, for in­stance, must spec­ify in the ti­tle that it is spon­sored. The video it­self must also carry a ban­ner stat­ing it is a paid promotion.</p>
    <p>Live-stream­ing videos must in­form view­ers ev­ery five min­utes about the paid ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>If not, both the in­flu­encer and the spon­sor will face a fine of up to 500 mil­lion won (S$579,000).</p>
    <p>“Pay to play” prac­tices on­line have long been a sub­ject of crit­i­cism, but, un­til now, there were no clear rules for in­flu­encers to fol­low.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, the KFTC slapped a 270 mil­lion won fine on seven com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Bri­tish home elec­tron­ics maker Dyson and South Korean cos­met­ics gi­ant Amorepa­cific, for en­gag­ing in undis­closed ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paigns with cer­tain in­flu­encers on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>They gave a to­tal of 1.15 bil­lion won in cash and free­bies to these in­flu­encers to fea­ture on their In­sta­gram pages, ac­cord­ing to the KFTC.</p>
    <p>But the in­flu­encers were not pe­nalised as there were no rules then re­quir­ing con­tent cre­ators to be open about spon­sor­ships.</p>
    <p>Even with the new ban, ob­servers say it might be chal­leng­ing for the au­thor­i­ties to en­force the rules and keep in­flu­encers in check.</p>
    <p>A study by the Korea Con­sumer Agency showed that only 30 per cent of 582 pro­mo­tional posts on 60 of the most pop­u­lar so­cial me­dia plat­forms in South Korea be­tween Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber last year in­di­cated they were spon­sored, and in ways that can­not be viewed clearly – for in­stance, only in the</p>
    <p>video de­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>Dis­guised mar­ket­ing has long been used on­line, such as via ad­ver­tise­ments look­ing like news ar­ti­cles, and “fake” re­views. A law­maker in Jan­uary pro­posed a Bill to fine in­flu­encers for de­cep­tive ad­ver­tis­ing, but it was left hang­ing after a new Par­lia­ment was voted in in April.</p>
    <p>In July, lo­cal news out­let Dis­patch</p>
    <p>ac­cused three per­son­al­i­ties of “pay to play” prac­tices on YouTube, in­clud­ing celebrity stylist Han Hyeyeon, known for her hon­est re­views of nae ton nae san lux­ury prod­ucts, mean­ing they were bought us­ing her money. She ended up post­ing an apol­ogy, after which she lost some 60,000 sub­scribers – out of 865,000 – within two days.</p>
    <p>Last month, YouTu­ber Cham PD, who has nearly 1.3 mil­lion sub­scribers, ac­cused sev­eral fel­low YouTu­bers of de­cep­tive ad­ver­tis­ing, adding that he has col­lected ev­i­dence for the past two years.</p>
    <p>Dozens of YouTu­bers, in­clud­ing pop­u­lar eat­ing chan­nel hosts Boki, YangPang and Tzuyang, ended up post­ing teary-eyed apolo­gies that drew crit­i­cism from fans, most no­tably those who pay a pre­mium sub­scrip­tion that of­fers ad-free ac­cess to con­tent on the video plat­form.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user Dal­moon felt “very dis­ap­pointed” to know that Boki’s videos con­tained paid ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other user wrote: “These are the chan­nels I watched and laughed a lot over, but now I feel so up­set and re­gret­ful.”</p>
    <p>Me­dia stud­ies pro­fes­sor Choi Se­jung of Korea Univer­sity said view­ers feel close to YouTu­bers, so they ex­pe­ri­ence be­trayal over the dis­guised prod­uct place­ments.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions pro­fes­sor Yoo Hyun-jae of So­gang Univer­sity said: “The in­flu­encer mar­ket is much more volatile and re­spon­sive to con­sumers… Mis­takes that in­flu­encers make can di­rectly i mpact their liveli­hood. That’s why they would apol­o­gise or quit the chan­nel.”</p>
    <p>As­pir­ing ac­tor Choi Han-na, 25, said spon­sor­ships dis­guised as nae ton nae san are un­fair to other YouTu­bers who flag prod­uct place­ments in their videos.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent Kim Su-hye, 25, said: “The new law is nec­es­sary to stop peo­ple from tak­ing ad­van­tage of false ad­ver­tis­ing.”</p>
