    <p>Hyundai Mo­tor’s move to house an elec­tric ve­hi­cle fac­tory in Singapore marks the first time the gi­ant South Korean au­tomaker has lo­cated a man­u­fac­tur­ing plant in a coun­try that has nei­ther a car in­dus­try nor a sub­stan­tial home mar­ket. The 28,000 sq m fa­cil­ity in the Jurong In­no­va­tion District will be called the Hyundai Mo­tor Group In­no­va­tion Cen­tre and cost al­most $400 mil­lion. Con­struc­tion is ex­pected to be com­pleted by end-2022 and the fac­tory may pro­duce 30,000 ve­hi­cles ev­ery year by 2025. About a fifth will be sold in the mar­ket and the rest ex­ported. With the fa­cil­ity sited close to what is to be the world’s most fu­tur­is­tic port, who knows where else the cars will be sold. For now, Asean beck­ons as a key des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle doubt that this is a sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ment for both Singapore and the Korean au­tomaker. In an ear­lier era, Singapore housed the car assem­bly plants of Ford Mo­tor and Mercedes-Benz. But that ended four decades ago as the coun­try be­gan to focus its en­er­gies on higher-value pro­duc­tion, and ser­vices. To­day, it can once again wel­come back the auto in­dus­try be­cause the in­dus­try’s fu­ture clearly is with elec­tric power and Singapore it­self has em­barked on plans to catal­yse elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) de­mand. EVs have fewer me­chan­i­cal parts and more elec­tron­ics, fac­tors that, when com­bined with au­to­ma­tion and robo­ti­sa­tion, of­fer a huge op­por­tu­nity for cus­tomi­sa­tion – where the fu­ture of pro­duc­tion is thought to lie.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will prob­a­bly see only a frac­tion of the cars made here. Given the fa­cil­ity’s Jurong lo­ca­tion, most of the cars to be ex­ported from here will prob­a­bly have only a few min­utes’ jour­ney be­fore be­ing loaded onto ships. In­deed, it is not in­con­ceiv­able that in the fu­ture, some of the fin­ish­ing touches could well be done on board as the ve­hi­cles ap­proach their des­ti­na­tions. The swift march of tech­nol­ogy and ad­vances in lo­gis­tics make pos­si­ble what might once have been con­sid­ered to be the realm of dreams. Now, amid ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ist in­stincts all round, it is up to diplo­mats, trade ne­go­tia­tors and politi­cians to de­liver on the chal­lenge of smooth­ing these fu­ture fair­ways of com­merce with ap­pro­pri­ate agree­ments.</p>
    <p>The Hyundai move is strong en­dorse­ment that Singapore re­mains at­trac­tive to in­vestors, es­pe­cially those in high tech­nol­ogy. Al­ready, jet en­gine-maker Rolls-Royce is poised to make Singapore its sole pro­duc­tion cen­tre for man­u­fac­tur­ing its hol­low ti­ta­nium wide chord fan blades, used to pro­pel its Trent en­gines that power air­craft such as the Air­bus A-380 and Boe­ing 787, with assem­bly and test­ing to be done in Eng­land. Singapore’s uni­ver­si­ties are po­si­tion­ing them­selves to sup­ply the engi­neer­ing and other skills this new era de­mands. What is more, all this is within an ecosys­tem that places the high­est pre­mium on in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion. Amid the bleak eco­nomic news these are clear sil­ver lin­ings.</p>
