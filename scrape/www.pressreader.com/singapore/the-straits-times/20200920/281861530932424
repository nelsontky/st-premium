    <p>For a sec­ond day, Tai­wan’s air force scram­bled jets af­ter sev­eral Chi­nese fighters and bombers crossed the sen­si­tive mid­line of the Tai­wan Strait, as a top US diplo­mat wrapped up a whirl­wind visit to the is­land that in­cluded a din­ner with Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen.</p>
    <p>US Un­der­sec­re­tary for Eco­nomic Af­fairs Keith Krach left Tai­wan yes­ter­day af­ter at­tend­ing a memo­rial ser­vice for the late for­mer pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui.</p>
    <p>The funeral ser­vice was held at a chapel in a Chris­tian univer­sity in New Taipei City, and those in at­ten­dance in­cluded Pres­i­dent Tsai and for­mer vice- pres­i­dent Lien Chan. Mr Krach kept a low pro­file at the memo­rial, in line with the na­ture of his visit to Tai­wan, which had been un­der wraps un­til the last minute.</p>
    <p>De­spite the trip be­ing rel­a­tively low key com­pared to last month’s visit by US Sec­re­tary of Health and Hu­man Services Alex Azar, Mr Krach’s pres­ence still prompted Bei­jing to first send 18 mil­i­tary jets into the Tai­wan Strait on Fri­day, and 19 jets yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing also an­nounced a mil­i­tary ex­er­cise near the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the Chi­nese for­eign min­istry lam­basted Mr Krach’s visit, ac­cus­ing the US of se­verely vi­o­lat­ing the one-China prin­ci­ple and un­der­min­ing US-China ties. It also vowed to re­tal­i­ate.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman Wang Wen­bin on Fri­day called the mil­i­tary ex­er­cise a “jus­ti­fi­able and nec­es­sary ac­tion taken in re­sponse to the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion across the Tai­wan Strait and to safe­guard China’s sovereignt­y and ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity”. A Na­tional De­fence Min­istry spokesman made sim­i­lar re­marks.</p>
    <p>In a stri­dent editorial yes­ter­day, the Chi­nese state-backed tabloid from the Univer­sity of</p>
    <p>Global Times said the lat­est ex­er­cise and pre­vi­ous drills have given the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army enough ex­pe­ri­ence to at­tack Tai­wan, call­ing them “re­hearsals on tak­ing over Tai­wan”.</p>
    <p>What is miss­ing now is a po­lit­i­cal rea­son for China to be­gin a real war to “smash Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence forces”, the editorial also said, and called for both the US and Tai­wan to not look upon the mil­i­tary ex­er­cise as a mere bluff.</p>
    <p>The Tai­wanese gov­ern­ment has re­mained fairly quiet on Mr Krach’s visit, say­ing lit­tle other than wel­com­ing words and en­cour­age­ment on fos­ter­ing a stronger re­la­tion­ship with the US.</p>
    <p>“Although it is a sym­bolic vic­tory for Tai­wan to have such a high-level politi­cian visit, Tsai does not want to ag­gra­vate the PRC more than she has to – keep­ing his time in Tai­wan short and with­out as much fan­fare lets Tai­wan en­joy the vic­tory with­out flaunt­ing it too much in the PRC’s face,” said Mr Lev Nachman, a Ful­bright re­search fel­low and PhD can­di­date who fo­cuses on Tai­wanese pol­i­tics at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Irvine. He was us­ing the acro­nym for Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China, the of­fi­cial name of China</p>
    <p>Prior to Mr Krach’s ar­rival, lo­cal me­dia had re­ported that the visit would most likely be tied to an “eco­nomic and com­mer­cial di­a­logue” that the Amer­i­can In­sti­tute in Tai­wan, the de facto US em­bassy, said would take place be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it seems that Mr Krach’s main agenda was only to at­tend Mr Lee’s funeral.</p>
    <p>Mr Nachman said this seems to in­di­cate trade talks may progress slower than ini­tially thought, but send­ing Mr Krach to Tai­wan, “shows a high level of com­mit­ment from the United States that they are se­ri­ous about fur­ther­ing re­la­tions with Tai­wan, even if it does not nec­es­sar­ily hap­pen overnight”.</p>
    <p>A for­mer re­searcher at a gov­ern­ment-af­fil­i­ated think-tank said hav­ing both host and vis­i­tor keep­ing mum about the visit is an in­di­ca­tor of how the two sides may not have agreed on how to work to­gether.</p>
    <p>“Both sides want to strengthen col­lab­o­ra­tion, but the US wants to re­build the sup­ply chains and beef up the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try. This goes against Tai­wan’s wishes to keep ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy in the is­land,” said the for­mer re­searcher who wished to re­main anony­mous.</p>
    <p>He also noted the sig­nif­i­cance of the pres­ence of Mr Mor­ris Chang, for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing Com­pany (TSMC), at a ban­quet Ms Tsai hosted for Mr Krach on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>TSMC is the world’s largest semi­con­duc­tor foundry and Mr Chang was the only lead­ing fig­ure in tech present at the event.</p>
    <p>“TSMC is ex­tremely im­por­tant to the US in its hopes to grow its own semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try and boost tech-based na­tional se­cu­rity,” said the for­mer re­searcher.</p>
    <p>“On this level, TSMC is a ma­jor chip for Tai­wan to draw the US in, but how the chip should be used would be a chal­lenge for the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Although it is a sym­bolic vic­tory for Tai­wan to have such a high-level politi­cian visit, Tsai does not want to ag­gra­vate the PRC more than she has to – keep­ing his time in Tai­wan short and with­out as much fan­fare lets Tai­wan en­joy the vic­tory with­out flaunt­ing it too much in the PRC’s face.</p>
    <p>MR LEV NACHMAN, Cal­i­for­nia, Irvine.</p>
