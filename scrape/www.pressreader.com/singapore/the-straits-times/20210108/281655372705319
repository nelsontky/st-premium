    <p>WASH­ING­TON The un­prece­dented vi­o­lence that Mr Don­ald Trump’s sup­port­ers wreaked on the United States Capi­tol spurred a wave of Repub­li­can crit­i­cism of the Pres­i­dent, sug­gest­ing the po­ten­tial for the GOP to in­creas­ingly dis­tance it­self from him as he leaves of­fice.</p>
    <p>Long-time Trump ally Tom Cot­ton, a sen­a­tor from Arkansas, said in a state­ment: “It is past time for the Pres­i­dent to ac­cept the re­sults of the elec­tion, quit mis­lead­ing the Amer­i­can peo­ple and re­pu­di­ate mob vi­o­lence.”</p>
    <p>Some sup­port­ers of Mr Trump’s at­tempt to get Congress to re­ject the Elec­toral Col­lege votes of key states won by Mr Joe Bi­den said they changed their plans af­ter the vi­o­lence on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Kelly Lo­ef­fler, who lost in a Ge­or­gia run-off race on Tues­day and had planned to ob­ject to her state’s vote for Mr Bi­den on Wed­nes­day, said she could not “in good con­science” con­tinue with her in­tended ob­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>Even Mr Trump’s staunch ally, Sen­a­tor Lind­sey Gra­ham, said he had seen enough. The South Carolina sen­a­tor, who was a con­fi­dant and golf part­ner of the Pres­i­dent as re­cently as Christ­mas Day, said: “All I can say is, count me out. Enough is enough. I have tried to be help­ful.”</p>
    <p>For­mer New Jer­sey gov­er­nor Chris Christie flagged that the Pres­i­dent and his son had spo­ken to the crowd, and the sub­se­quent vi­o­lence “is the re­sult of their words”, whether in­tended or not. He said on ABC that Mr Trump’s initial re­sponse to sim­ply call for pro­test­ers to be peace­ful was “not good enough”. Repub­li­cans who have pre­vi­ously clashed with the Pres­i­dent were more stri­dent.</p>
    <p>The No. 3 House Repub­li­can, Ms Liz Cheney of Wy­oming, said: “There is no ques­tion the Pres­i­dent formed the mob, the Pres­i­dent in­cited the mob, the Pres­i­dent ad­dressed the mob – he lit the flame.” She said on CNN that Mr Trump’s re­sponse “so far has been com­pletely in­tol­er­a­ble and in­suf­fi­cient”.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Ted Cruz, one of the Repub­li­cans who had led the ef­forts to chal­lenge the Elec­toral Col­lege re­sults in Wed­nes­day’s joint ses­sion of Congress, con­demned the at­tack on the Capi­tol. “The Con­sti­tu­tion pro­tects peace­ful protest, but vi­o­lence – from left or right – is al­ways wrong,” Mr Cruz tweeted.</p>
    <p>Utah Sen­a­tor Mitt Rom­ney, who was the Repub­li­can party’s 2012 pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee, said af­ter the cham­ber re­con­vened: “We gather due to a self­ish man’s in­jured pride, and the out­rage of sup­port­ers who he has de­lib­er­ately mis­in­formed for the past two months and stirred to ac­tion this very morn­ing.”</p>
    <p>“It was pour­ing fuel on a spark,” GOP Sen­a­tor Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said in ref­er­ence to Mr Trump’s re­marks at a mid­day rally where he egged on pro­test­ers to go to the Capi­tol. “I do think the Pres­i­dent bears some re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mitch McCon­nell, Se­nate ma­jor­ity l eader and sev­enth-term Ken­tucky Repub­li­can, on Wed­nes­day sig­nalled an in­creas­ing tilt against Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump claims the elec­tion was stolen,” he said in his speech af­ter the joint con­gres­sional ses­sion be­gan. Dis­miss­ing those claims, he said that the elec­tion was not even par­tic­u­larly close and that it was Congress’ job un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion to ac­cept the re­sults and cer­tify Mr Bi­den the win­ner.</p>
    <p>“The vot­ers, the courts and the states have all spo­ken. They have all spo­ken. If we over­rule them, it would dam­age our repub­lic for­ever,” he said.</p>
