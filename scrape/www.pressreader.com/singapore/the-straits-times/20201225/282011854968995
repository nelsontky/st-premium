    <p>Few events try as hard as the Olympics to al­ter our be­hav­iour. Be­fore the Lon­don games in 2012, the or­gan­is­ers promised that mil­lions of Bri­tons would take up ex­er­cise and “change the way they live their lives”. For­eign­ers would be at­tracted to work and in­vest in the United King­dom, help­ing to turn six weeks of sport into “six years of busi­ness ben­e­fit”. And while the Olympics lasted, they re­ally did seem trans­for­ma­tional. The open­ing cer­e­mony showed a con­fi­dent, mul­ti­cul­tural Bri­tain, ready to lead the world on the track and off it.</p>
    <p>But the legacy of Lon­don 2012 melted away. Pub­lic par­tic­i­pa­tion in sport didn’t in­crease. Some he­roes of the games, Bradley Wig­gins and Mo Farah, lost their lus­tre. The im­age of Bri­tain at ease with it­self was shat­tered by the ref­er­en­dums on Scot­tish in­de­pen­dence and Brexit. Per­haps the Olympics’ largest legacy was to ac­cel­er­ate the gen­tri­fi­ca­tion of a part of east Lon­don that would have hap­pened any­way due to its prox­im­ity to the bank­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Is it pos­si­ble that the pan­demic’s legacy will prove sim­i­larly ephemeral? From bak­ing sour­dough to back­ing a state-sub­sidised econ­omy, we have em­braced change in 2020. But now with the end of the pan­demic al­most in sight, what many peo­ple seem to crave is not to re­think their be­hav­iour fur­ther, but to snap back to nor­mal­ity.</p>
    <p>In March, be­fore Euro­pean coun­tries had locked down, I wrote an es­say en­ti­tled: “Will coro­n­avirus change how we live?” I sug­gested that, in the medium term, the pan­demic would re­duce busi­ness travel, in­crease hand­wash­ing and change China’s live an­i­mal mar­kets. OK, I did not fore­see the re­vival of QR codes.</p>
    <p>But I went fur­ther, and ar­gued that the coro­n­avirus might lead us to ac­cept our own fragility. We would bet­ter un­der­stand risks such as an­tibi­otic re­sis­tance, US-China con­flict and ecosys­tem break­down. The ex­pe­ri­ence of hard­ship dur­ing the pan­demic would make us more likely to ac­cept re­straints on our lives to min­imise fu­ture prob­lems. I had in mind the al­tered diet, con­sump­tion and po­lit­i­cal out­look nec­es­sary to fight cli­mate change: “If the shock of coro­n­avirus dis­rup­tion isn’t enough for us to re­cal­i­brate, what will be?”</p>
    <p>Now I won­der if I was over-op­ti­mistic. Imag­ine if, by late 2021, much of Europe and the United States has been vac­ci­nated against the dis­ease. Those peo­ple who haven’t lost their jobs have amassed sav­ings. Imag­ine their de­sire to make up for lost time: par­ties, fes­ti­vals, travel. What if the new nor­mal looks quite like the old nor­mal?</p>
    <p>Sports fans have al­ready started to re­turn to sta­di­ums; re­tirees are back on cruise ships. Some parts of the pan­demic that seemed mo­men­tous — the clap for car­ers, the YouTube ex­er­cise rou­tines — have be­come dis­tant mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>Dr Carlo Rovelli, the best-sell­ing the­o­ret­i­cal physi­cist, points out that, when his na­tive Italy emerged from the first wave of the virus, good in­ten­tions made dur­ing lock­down were “for­got­ten and dis­ap­peared in two weeks. Ev­ery­thing was re­mark­ably ex­actly as usual”.</p>
    <p>Other thinkers draw analo­gies with the 1920s, when, af­ter a world war and an in­fluenza pan­demic, Amer­i­cans flipped into a decade of con­sumerism and deca­dence. “If his­tory is a guide, it seems likely that con­sump­tion will come back with a vengeance,” writes Yale so­ci­ol­o­gist Nicholas Chris­takis in his book Apollo’s Ar­row.</p>
    <p>The chron­i­cler of 1920s ex­cess, F. Scott Fitzger­ald, was in an army camp in Alabama as the Span­ish flu gripped Amer­ica. Soon af­ter hear­ing that his close friend Sigour­ney Fay, a Catholic priest, had died of the dis­ease, he said: “This has made me nearly sure that I will be­come a priest”.</p>
    <p>But of course he did not be­come a priest when the pan­demic ended. He be­came pretty much the op­po­site. He plunged deeper into a slightly de­bauched ro­mance with his fu­ture wife, Zelda. Biog­ra­phers ex­plain his out­look in terms of his un­ful­filled de­sire to fight glo­ri­ously in the first world war; they don’t men­tion the flu.</p>
    <p>Few peo­ple have prob­a­bly vowed, dur­ing the pan­demic, to be­come priests. But many of us have of­ten seen life dif­fer­ently – and vowed to be­come a more whole­some ver­sion of our­selves. When the vac­cine ar­rives, will we re­mem­ber, or will we do ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble to for­get?</p>
    <p>THE IM­PACT OF THE CORO­N­AVIRUS</p>
    <p>No one doubts the coro­n­avirus will leave some kind of im­pact. It would have changed his­tory even if its only ef­fect had been to swing 42,918 votes in Wis­con­sin, Ge­or­gia and Ari­zona, by which Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump missed out on re-elec­tion. The ef­fects of in­creased pub­lic debt and sci­en­tific in­vest­ment are likely huge. But will the coro­n­avirus lead us to con­sciously change our be­hav­iour in search of a bet­ter world?</p>
    <p>There are two types of pan­demic be­hav­iour that are likely to en­dure: Where we have re­moved in­er­tia, and where we have sunk in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home fits into the first cat­e­gory: Tra­di­tion meant it was rude for some­one not to turn up in per­son, now that has been re­moved. Nearly four in 10 em­ployed Amer­i­cans say that their job can mostly be done from home; half of th­ese say they in­tend to work at home mostly or partly in fu­ture if they can, ac­cord­ing to the Pew Re­search Cen­tre. (Work­ing from home has meant work­ing longer hours, but this need not en­dure once so­cial­is­ing is com­pet­ing for our time.)</p>
    <p>“My pre­dic­tion would be that over 50 per cent of busi­ness travel and over 30 per cent of days in the of­fice will go away,” said Mi­crosoft co-founder Bill Gates last month.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ap­point­ments, court hear­ings and par­lia­men­tary de­bates have worked pass­ably well on­line. One group of aca­demics even pre­dicts “the equiv­a­lent of a Cam­brian ex­plo­sion in the field of con­fer­ences”, now that peo­ple no longer have to travel around the world.</p>
    <p>There are mod­er­at­ing fac­tors. One is that phys­i­cal pres­ence still adds value in terms of off­stage con­ver­sa­tion and serendip­ity. You don’t need to travel for a one-to-one, but you might for a one-to-var­i­ous groups.</p>
    <p>Another is that the lack of au­di­ence feed­back makes pre­sen­ta­tions less ex­cit­ing for</p>
    <p>speak­ers. “When you’re on Zoom, you un­der­stand how repet­i­tive you are,” says Bul­gar­ian po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Ivan Krastev, au­thor of the es­say Is it To­mor­row Yet?, about the ef­fects of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­er­tia has dis­ap­peared else­where with the take-up of on­line shop­ping and TV stream­ing. Re­search sug­gests that it takes sev­eral months – per­haps 66 days – for daily ac­tiv­i­ties to be­come habits. If that ap­plies widely, there may be no com­ing back for the high streets, the cin­e­mas and lin­ear TV. We prob­a­bly won’t re­turn to pay­ing in cash ei­ther.</p>
    <p>The se­cond cat­e­gory of en­dur­ing be­hav­iour is where we have sunk costs. If you have, in lock­down, bought a Pelo­ton bike or adopted a pet, you may find it hard to go back. Like­wise, if you have taken a ca­reer de­ci­sion, or been forced to.</p>
    <p>Dr Rovelli took early re­tire­ment dur­ing the pan­demic. “I’m in my 60s. All through this Covid thing, I’ve been think­ing I could die – it’s a con­crete pos­si­bil­ity, has in­creased my sense that life is now, it’s not to­mor­row.” He works, but no longer teaches. “I’m so happy.”</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is those who have felt most vul­ner­a­ble to the virus who will change most rad­i­cally; then again, the white-col­lar work­ers mov­ing to homes in the coun­try are not do­ing so be­cause they felt vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>What about pan­demic be­hav­iours that do not bring im­me­di­ate ben­e­fits? Coro­n­avirus has raised our stan­dards of hy­giene (at least when it comes to spread­ing in­fec­tions). Peo­ple now know more about how res­pi­ra­tory dis­eases travel. Will we re­shape our so­cial norms? It might be less ac­cept­able to go to a restau­rant if you have a cold. Wear­ing a mask, or so­cially dis­tanc­ing, might be­come nor­mal in flu sea­son, even if it’s not com­pul­sory.</p>
    <p>“Do I think there will come a big moment where we have a mas­sive party, and throw our masks and hand sani­tiser, and say, ‘that’s it, it’s be­hind us’, like the end of the war? No, I don’t,” Eng­land’s deputy chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Jonathan Van-Tam told a press con­fer­ence this month. “Those kind of habits that we’ve learnt</p>
    <p>from, that clearly stop the spread of other res­pi­ra­tory viruses such as flu, will per­haps per­sist for many years.”</p>
    <p>To which UK Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, with his sense of the pop­u­lar mood, replied: “On the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to nor­mal…”</p>
    <p>His­tory pro­vides ev­i­dence to sup­port both Pro­fes­sor Van-Tam and Mr John­son. Af­ter the flu pan­demic, spit­toons died out across the US, notes Chris­takis in Apollo’s Ar­row. Spit­ting’s down­sides had long been known: New York’s san­i­tary po­lice had been ar­rest­ing and fin­ing peo­ple for years for “the filthy habit”. The pan­demic helped it on the way.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, our de­sire to fight dis­ease has lim­its. In De­cem­ber 1920, when it was clear that a third win­ter of Span­ish flu was un­likely in the US, the sur­geon gen­eral com­plained that it was “un­for­tu­nate” that Amer­i­cans were in­ter­ested in “spec­tac­u­lar epi­demic out­breaks of dis­ease”, but not by the “daily oc­cur­rence of pre­ventable death”, such as diph­the­ria and smallpox. Just be­cause we can pre­vent death it does not mean that we will, if we no longer feel at risk.</p>
    <p>Western med­i­cal fig­ures have sug­gested the coro­n­avirus could per­ma­nently change how we greet each other. “I don’t think we should ever shake hands ever again,” said the US’ top in­fec­tious dis­ease of­fi­cial An­thony Fauci in April. The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has sug­gested eight al­ter­na­tive greet­ings, in­clud­ing the wave, a bow and na­maste.</p>
    <p>“What shows is, I trust you enough that I let you put your germs on my hand,” says health psy­chol­ogy pro­fes­sor Su­san Michie at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don. Given how much peo­ple crave phys­i­cal con­tact, maybe the bal­ance will be hand­shakes plus hand­wash­ing.</p>
    <p>LESSONS FROM THE PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>In the US, 86 per cent of adults say there is some kind of les­son for hu­man­ity to learn from the pan­demic. One-third think that the les­son was sent by God. Be­liev­ing there’s a les­son is a way of com­fort­ing our­selves: oth­er­wise we are just go­ing through this crap for the sake of it.</p>
    <p>But it is also cor­rect. There is a les­son in the coro­n­avirus: if you mis­treat the nat­u­ral world, it will bite you.</p>
    <p>Covid-19, like Ebola, Zika and var­i­ous other out­breaks, can be linked to how we treat other an­i­mals. Our degra­da­tion of ecosys­tems and our live­stock farms will con­tinue to cre­ate pan­demics un­less we change what</p>
    <p>we eat and con­sume.</p>
    <p>If Homo sapi­ens were a ra­tio­nal, cen­trally gov­erned species – able to plan our own fu­ture – then we would tackle not only the causes of pan­demics, but also the causes of other risks like cli­mate change that prom­ise sim­i­lar dis­rup­tion. (A warmer cli­mate also in­creases the risk of pan­demics, by al­low­ing vec­tors to ex­pand their ge­o­graphic range.)</p>
    <p>Bri­tish philoso­pher Toby Ord ar­gues that one of the most likely and im­por­tant changes brought by the pan­demic will be “a kind of so­ci­etal im­mune re­sponse”: “It will open a win­dow of time in which we ac­tu­ally take cat­a­strophic risks se­ri­ously, and are will­ing to pay the costs re­quired to de­velop pro­tec­tive mea­sures be­fore the next catas­tro­phe strikes.” He en­vis­ages new leg­is­la­tion and ringfenced fund­ing, which en­dure af­ter the mem­ory of the coro­n­avirus has faded.</p>
    <p>You can imag­ine some sce­nar­ios in which this will oc­cur. Health min­is­ters around the world will be fear­ful of be­ing caught out again — they are un­likely to let stocks of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment run low; they won’t skip strat­egy meet­ings on pan­demic plan­ning. But for all the talk of “Build Back Bet­ter” in the US and UK, the scale of re­think is in the bal­ance. Even if peo­ple are mo­ti­vated to change their be­hav­iour, it is up to gov­ern­ments, em­ploy­ers and others to pro­vide the op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>More­over, there is no short­age of prob­lems: The pan­demic has ex­posed racial health in­equal­i­ties, poor hous­ing, and the dig­i­tal di­vide, and it has wors­ened school per­for­mance and in­come in­equal­ity (the UK’s former “trou­bled fam­i­lies tsar” Louise Casey has warned of a com­ing “pe­riod of des­ti­tu­tion”). Af­ter the bailouts of the past year, it is hard to ar­gue that we can’t af­ford to do th­ese things. There may, how­ever, be a short­age of en­ergy.</p>
    <p>If this were the end of a war, per­haps politi­cians would be able to steel the pub­lic to tackle th­ese chal­lenges. It doesn’t feel like that. Un­like the end of the se­cond world war in Europe, our cities do not need phys­i­cally re­build­ing. We can look around us, and imag­ine the pan­demic never hap­pened. The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment is al­low­ing fam­i­lies to mix in­doors for Christ­mas — which doesn’t sug­gest it thinks that peo­ple are ready for fur­ther sac­ri­fices. It de­cided against a pay rise for the very nurses and doc­tors ap­plauded dur­ing lock­down.</p>
    <p>Be­cause the pan­demic has wors­ened in­equal­i­ties, it may be harder for states to call for re­straint or be­hav­iour change. “Ev­ery­thing has to be han­dled</p>
    <p>re­ally sen­si­tively,” says Prof Michie, who sits on the UK’s sci­en­tific ad­vi­sory group, Sage. “The gov­ern­ment needs to think about how to re­build so­cial sol­i­dar­ity.”</p>
    <p>What’s more, we do not seem to have come to­gether, at least in the West. Only 19 per cent of Amer­i­cans and 22 per cent of Ger­mans say that the pan­demic has in­creased so­cial to­geth­er­ness.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has not just been po­lit­i­cally di­vi­sive, it has been an in­di­vid­u­alised ex­pe­ri­ence. It is hard to know even what your friends and ac­quain­tances are go­ing through. Wars throw peo­ple to­gether; pan­demics keep them apart. We haven’t had the con­ver­sa­tions that would help nudge us to re­assess our so­ci­ety. Maybe this will change as the vac­cines are rolled out.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tion­ally, too, the pan­demic has been a lost op­por­tu­nity so far. Manag­ing the risks that face us re­quires ef­fec­tive in­ter­na­tional ac­tion. But the pan­demic has been marked by na­tional re­sponses (and global, non-gov­ern­men­tal ef­forts like the Pfizer/BioNTech vac­cine).</p>
    <p>For all this, I don’t quite be­lieve in a re­run of the Roaring Twen­ties.</p>
    <p>The 1920s roared partly be­cause of the emer­gence of af­ford­able con­sumer prod­ucts, in­clud­ing ra­dios, phones and cars. The 2020s come af­ter a two-decade long con­sumer boom, en­abled by Chi­nese man­u­fac­tur­ing. The</p>
    <p>1920s sig­nalled Amer­ica’s rise; the 2020s will sig­nal China’s.</p>
    <p>What I do fear is that politi­cians will fail to use this moment. In his es­says, “There are places in the world where rules are less im­por­tant than kind­ness”, Dr Rovelli talks about how the Ital­ian rad­i­cals of 1977 saw their vi­sion of an egal­i­tar­ian so­ci­ety fail, and then moved on: “the big dreams founder against the force of daily life”.</p>
    <p>I have heard lots of peo­ple say how much they are look­ing for­ward to the end of the pan­demic; I have hardly heard any say that we must make sure we never face such dis­rup­tion again.</p>
    <p>Nor­mal­ity is some­thing to strive for; it is also some­thing to re­gret. We have no rea­son to think this will be the last pan­demic of our life­times. In cli­mate change, hu­man­ity faces ar­guably the big­gest col­lec­tive prob­lem it has ever faced. If the big­gest les­son that we take from 2020 is that it’s pos­si­ble to work from home two days a week, then we have fallen short. The pan­demic’s legacy will have un­der­whelmed as much as the Olympics’.</p>
    <p>I have heard lots of peo­ple say how much they are look­ing for­ward to the end of the pan­demic; I have hardly heard any say that we must make sure we never face such dis­rup­tion again.</p>
