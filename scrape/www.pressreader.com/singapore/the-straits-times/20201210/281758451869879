    <p>NEW YORK • Ms Erika Be­cerra was eight months preg­nant when she learnt she had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Al­most im­me­di­ately af­ter she re­ceived the re­sult, her body be­gan aching, she de­vel­oped a fever and felt tight­ness in her chest.</p>
    <p>When she be­gan hav­ing trou­ble breath­ing, her hus­band called for an am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>Three days later, on Nov 15, she gave birth in a Detroit hospi­tal to a healthy boy, Diego – named for his fa­ther. She never got to hold him, her brother told KCBS-TV in Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>Ms Be­cerra’s health de­clined so rapidly that doc­tors put her on a ventilator, where she re­mained for 18 days.</p>
    <p>Ms Be­cerra, 33, who had no known health prob­lems be­fore she be­came ill, died last Thurs­day, sur­rounded by her par­ents and brother, who had rushed from East Los An­ge­les, ac­cord­ing to her god­mother Clau­dia Gar­cia.</p>
    <p>“It was a com­plete shock – she was fine,” Ms Gar­cia said. “I’m speech­less. I’m still try­ing to wake up from this night­mare.”</p>
    <p>Last month, the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) added preg­nancy to the list of con­di­tions that put peo­ple with Covid-19 at in­creased risk of de­vel­op­ing se­vere ill­ness, in­clud­ing a height­ened risk of death.</p>
    <p>The agency added preg­nancy to the list af­ter a study that ex­am­ined the health out­comes of 409,462 symp­to­matic women aged 15 to 44 who tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, 23,434 of whom were preg­nant.</p>
    <p>The study found that preg­nant women faced a 70 per cent in­creased risk of death com­pared with non-preg­nant women who were symp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The preg­nant women also were sig­nif­i­cantly more likely to re­quire in­ten­sive care, to be con­nected to a spe­cialised heart-lung by­pass ma­chine and to re­quire me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion than non-preg­nant women.</p>
    <p>“When you think about a grow­ing uterus press­ing on the di­aphragm and lift­ing it up­wards, in gen­eral, it’s harder to breathe when you’re preg­nant.” said Dr Cyn­thia Gyamfi-Ban­ner­man, an ob­ste­tri­cian at New York-Presbyteri­an/Columbia Univer­sity Irv­ing Med­i­cal Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Adding a res­pi­ra­tory dis­ease just makes it more chal­leng­ing.”</p>
    <p>Dr Gyamfi-Ban­ner­man said Ms Be­cerra’s death was a re­minder of the im­por­tance for preg­nant women to main­tain so­cial dis­tance, wear masks and min­imise time out­side their homes.</p>
    <p>But she said doc­tors still need more data to get a bet­ter sense of the risks for preg­nant women who con­tract Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The ab­so­lute risk of death for preg­nant women who con­tracted</p>
    <p>the coro­n­avirus was still lower than for women who con­tracted the H1N1 virus dur­ing preg­nancy, ac­cord­ing to the CDC study.</p>
    <p>A Nov 19 study, which was pub­lished in Jama Net­work Open, also found that 95 per cent of preg­nant women who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 had no ad­verse out­comes.</p>
    <p>“The vast ma­jor­ity of preg­nant women with Covid-19 do very well,” Dr Gyamfi-Ban­ner­man said.</p>
    <p>Ms Gar­cia said that the fam­ily did not know how Ms Be­cerra con­tracted the virus. Rel­a­tives spec­u­lated that she must have be­come in­fected early last month, dur­ing her many vis­its to the doc­tor late in the preg­nancy, when she be­gan ex­pe­ri­enc­ing mild con­trac­tions. She learnt she was in­fected with the virus on Nov 7.</p>
    <p>Ms Be­cerra’s hus­band Diego, a land­scaper, has been tak­ing care of the cou­ple’s in­fant son and oneyear-old daugh­ter Erika. All three have tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19, Ms Gar­cia said.</p>
    <p>She added that her god­daugh­ter was ec­static when she learnt she was hav­ing a boy.</p>
    <p>“She was so ex­cited,” Ms Gar­cia said. “She would say, ‘I’m go­ing to have my boy and I’m go­ing to have my girl and they’re go­ing to grow up to­gether.’”</p>
