    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) The Den­ver Nuggets are the only National Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) team to have twice come back from 3-1 deficits and gone on to win their post-sea­son se­ries.</p>
    <p>They are now one step closer to­wards mak­ing it a third time in the play-off “bub­ble” at Dis­ney World af­ter hold­ing off a late fight­back from the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers to roar back into con­tention in the West­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ja­mal Mur­ray scored a team-high 28 points, in­clud­ing two cru­cial late three-point­ers in the clos­ing min­utes, as the third seeds de­feated the top seeds 114-106 in Game 3 to cut the deficit to 2-1 in the best-of­seven se­ries.</p>
    <p>Den­ver now have at least two more games to play and by the looks of it, they have no in­ten­tion of ex­it­ing early, with the prize of a maiden NBA Fi­nals ap­pear­ance very much up for grabs.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body al­ways has us pack­ing our bags and leav­ing, but we’re not ready to go,” coach Michael Malone said. “For some rea­son, we love this bub­ble.”</p>
    <p>Thriv­ing in ad­ver­sity is what his team do best and no one has shown more heart in Or­lando than Den­ver.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers had trailed by 20 points with just over 10 min­utes re­main­ing, but whit­tled away their op­po­nents’ lead to just three points with 3min 53sec left on the clock.</p>
    <p>But just as it looked as if LeBron James and An­thony Davis were poised to com­plete a re­mark­able turn­around, Mur­ray re­grouped to take the game away from the cham­pi­onship favourites.</p>
    <p>Malone claimed his play­ers – who had suf­fered an ag­o­nis­ing buzzer­beater de­feat in Game 2 – were de­ter­mined not to go 3-0 down.</p>
    <p>“I had no doubt we were go­ing to show up tonight,” he said. “They’re a very re­silient group, and they’ve proved that time and time again.”</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers, mean­while, were left re­flect­ing on an un­even dis­play which ul­ti­mately left them with too much to do, even though James led all scor­ers with 30 points and had a triple-dou­ble, while fel­low for­ward Davis had an­other 27 points.</p>
    <p>Davis ad­mit­ted his poor show­ing on the glass was a big fac­tor in the loss, say­ing: “I can’t have just two re­bounds (a ca­reer low). I have to do a bet­ter job… I just have to be bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Game 4 takes place to­day and the Nuggets have vowed they will con­tinue to push the Lak­ers all the way.</p>
    <p>“Maybe they can beat us by 20, 30, they can beat us by a last shot, but we just can­not quit,” cen­tre Nikola Jo­kic, who con­trib­uted 22 points on the night, said. “Ef­fort needs to be there.”</p>
    <p>The NBA Fi­nals com­mence next Wed­nes­day and will con­clude next month, but given the on­go­ing un­cer­tainty brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic on top of the usual close-sea­son break, the new term is likely to start only next year.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on CNN, league com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver said: “We said the ear­li­est we would start is Christ­mas of this year. But the more I’m learn­ing and lis­ten­ing to (lead­ing Amer­i­can in­fec­tious dis­eases of­fi­cial) Dr An­thony Fauci, I con­tinue to be­lieve we’re go­ing to be bet­ter off go­ing into Jan­uary.”</p>
