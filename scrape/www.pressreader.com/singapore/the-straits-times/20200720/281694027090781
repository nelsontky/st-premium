    <p>A le­gal poser has arisen in the law­suit brought by Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC) on be­half of the for­mer Pung­gol East SMC, after the Work­ers’ Party (WP) won Sengkang GRC at the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Chief among the ques­tions is who will take charge of the case, now that the for­mer sin­gle seat – which was ab­sorbed into Sengkang GRC – has gone back to the WP.</p>
    <p>PRPTC had orig­i­nally sued WP chair­man Sylvia Lim, for­mer party chief Low Thia Khi­ang and six other de­fen­dants in the High Court for al­leged losses in­curred when Pung­gol East was un­der their watch. It ini­ti­ated the civil suit after the WP-run Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil (AHTC) had taken the same de­fen­dants to court.</p>
    <p>Pung­gol East had been man­aged by AHTC from 2013 to 2015, but was wrested back by the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party in the 2015 polls.</p>
    <p>PRPTC and the WP town coun­cil­lors are ap­peal­ing against a High Court judg­ment which ruled, among other things, that Ms Lim and Mr Low had breached their fidu­ciary du­ties to the town coun­cil. The cases are sched­uled to be heard by the Court of Ap­peal next month. The sums payable to the plain­tiffs will be as­sessed sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>But Pung­gol East was voted into WP hands ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Lawyers say one is­sue to be clar­i­fied is who the plain­tiffs are, now that the sin­gle seat for­merly un­der PRPTC has changed hands and is in the process of be­ing handed over to the WP.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther is­sue would be that ex­ist­ing lawyers would have to take in­struc­tions from the new client – likely a new town coun­cil set up and run by the WP – whose views as a client may vary from PRPTC’s, said lawyer Dhamen­dra Ya­dav.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor of Law Benjamin Ong from the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity noted that un­der the Town Coun­cils Act, the Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment has pow­ers to es­tab­lish any new town coun­cils, dis­solve any re­dun­dant town coun­cils and pro­vide for an or­derly tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Act, the min­is­ter has to is­sue these or­ders on the 14th day after the elec­tion re­sults are de­clared, he said, not­ing that these were an­nounced in the early morn­ing on July 11. This would mean the or­ders will be is­sued on, and take ef­fect from, July 25, he added.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that based on past prac­tice, the July 25 or­der could spec­ify that le­gal pro­ceed­ings by</p>
    <p>PRPTC which re­late to the area of Pung­gol East SMC may be con­tin­ued and en­forced by the new Sengkang Town Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>He cited what took place after the 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion, when the Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment or­dered, among other things, that ex­ist­ing le­gal pro­ceed­ings re­lat­ing to the area of Pung­gol East SMC may be con­tin­ued and en­forced by PRPTC with ef­fect from Dec 1, 2015.</p>
    <p>This ex­plained why PRPTC was one of the plain­tiffs in the High Court case, he added.</p>
    <p>“If I am cor­rect in my pre­dic­tion... then the ef­fect of the July 25 or­der will be that the de­fen­dants will now be li­able to AHTC and Sengkang Town Coun­cil,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Ong pointed out the likely ef­fect of such an or­der would be that PRPTC’s lawyers be­come the lawyers for the fu­ture Sengkang Town Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>“But it is pos­si­ble for Sengkang Town Coun­cil to dis­charge the lawyers. It is also in the­ory pos­si­ble that the ex­ist­ing lawyers for PRPTC might, for what­ever rea­son, dis­charge them­selves from act­ing on be­half of Sengkang Town Coun­cil,” he added.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh is rep­re­sent­ing PRPTC in the suit.</p>
    <p>PRPTC has ap­pealed against the judg­ment is­sued last Oc­to­ber by Justice Kan­nan Ramesh, specif­i­cally in re­la­tion to how the amount of com­pen­sa­tion payable by the de­fen­dants is to be cal­cu­lated.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers filed, PRPTC is ap­peal­ing against the part of the de­ci­sion by Justice Ramesh which held that the town coun­cil has to show the loss to be re­cov­ered in re­la­tion to Ms Lim, Mr Low, Ms How Weng Fan and the es­tate of the late Mr Danny Loh for their breaches of their fidu­ciary du­ties.</p>
    <p>PRPTC is also ap­peal­ing against Justice Ramesh’s rul­ing that it is not en­ti­tled to com­pen­sa­tion com­puted by ref­er­ence to orig­i­nal sums that were used.</p>
    <p>Prof Ong said the fu­ture Sengkang Town Coun­cil has ev­ery in­cen­tive to co­op­er­ate in al­low­ing the lit­i­ga­tion to pro­ceed smoothly.</p>
    <p>“It is in the new town coun­cil mem­bers’ in­ter­est to demon­strate be­fore the pub­lic that they will abide by the law and rel­e­vant le­gal pro­cesses,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, the Work­ers’ Party, like all po­lit­i­cal par­ties, has an in­ter­est in hav­ing the Court of Ap­peal clar­ify the law on town coun­cils.”</p>
    <p>The WP de­clined to com­ment on the mat­ter when ap­proached.</p>
