    <p>A re­tired In­done­sian-Chi­nese busi­ness­man, who sued four of his chil­dren for the re­turn of 122 gold bars that had been willed to them by his wife, has lost his case in the High Court here.</p>
    <p>Mr Soe­marto Sulis­tio bought the gold bars, each weigh­ing 1kg, with his wife Soemiati in 1989 us­ing money they had in their joint ac­count at UOB bank in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The gold bars were ini­tially held un­der their joint names, but in 2016, Mr Sulis­tio, now 87, signed cer­tifi­cates to trans­fer own­er­ship to his wife.</p>
    <p>She died a year later and he found out that she had be­queathed the gold bars to four of their five chil­dren. Af­ter an un­suc­cess­ful chal­lenge to her will in Hong Kong, he sued the four.</p>
    <p>Mr Sulis­tio claimed that the sign­ing of the cer­tifi­cates did not change the cou­ple’s initial com­mon in­ten­tion to hold the gold bars as joint as­sets.</p>
    <p>He con­tended that as the re­main­ing sur­vivor, he was the ben­e­fi­cial owner of the gold bars. His claims were dis­missed by Jus­tice Va­lerie Thean.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten judg­ment yes­ter­day, the judge said there was no dis­pute that the cou­ple ini­tially had a com­mon in­ten­tion to hold the gold bars for their joint ben­e­fit. How­ever, she found that there was “suf­fi­cient and com­pelling ev­i­dence” of a change in their in­ten­tion in 2016.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Thean found that Mr Sulis­tio signed the cer­tifi­cates as part of a wider agree­ment between the cou­ple – Madam Soemiati had asked for the gold bars in ex­change for al­low­ing older son Rudy to man­age their land in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Rudy was specif­i­cally left out of Madam Soemiati’s will and took his fa­ther’s side in the suit.</p>
    <p>The judge said Madam Soemiati “wished to se­cure the gold bars for her own pur­poses and if she were to die without us­ing the gold bars, she wished to ben­e­fit the de­fen­dants”.</p>
    <p>Mr Sulis­tio and Madam Soemiati mar­ried in the 1950s and had three daugh­ters and two sons. The cou­ple lived in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Their daugh­ters said their par­ents’ mar­riage broke down in 2012, partly due to Madam Soemiati’s “dif­fi­cult re­la­tion­ship” with Mr Sulis­tio’s nurse, Mr Lee Yan Wo.</p>
    <p>El­dest daugh­ter Yetty said Madam Soemiati was up­set that she had been bul­lied by Mr Lee and Mr Sulis­tio did not do any­thing to stand up for her.</p>
    <p>Mr Sulis­tio in­sisted that their re­la­tion­ship had been ami­ca­ble, while Rudy said his mother moved out so she could have the free­dom to play mahjong with her friends.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Thean was not con­vinced by Mr Sulis­tio and Rudy’s tes­ti­mony.</p>
    <p>The judge ac­cepted the de­fen­dants’ con­tention that the trans­fer of the gold bars was part of a deal in which Madam Soemiati was try­ing to guar­an­tee her fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Madam Soemiati, who was se­ri­ously ill with mount­ing med­i­cal ex­penses, was con­cerned her as­sets with Mr Sulis­tio were be­ing de­pleted as large sums of money had been trans­ferred to Rudy from joint ac­counts she held with her hus­band.</p>
    <p>Rudy did not chal­lenge re­ceiv­ing about US$7.2 mil­lion between 2010 and 2016, and at least US$1 mil­lion (S$1.3 mil­lion) re­mains un­ac­counted for, ac­cord­ing to the judg­ment.</p>
