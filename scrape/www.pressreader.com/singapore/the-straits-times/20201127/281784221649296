    <p>•</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said he has ap­pointed his “best peo­ple” to work on break­ing a stale­mate that has seen over 50 ships laden with Aus­tralian coal stranded off Chi­nese ports, as ten­sions be­tween the two sides rise.</p>
    <p>More than US$500 mil­lion (S$670 mil­lion) worth of Aus­tralian coal and about 1,000 crew mem­bers on the ships are stuck af­ter China black­listed a wide swathe of Aus­tralian com­modi­ties and food­stuff, amid what Mr Mor­ri­son de­scribed yes­ter­day as an “ex­tra­or­di­nary pe­riod” in the re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>“We’ll work the process through with the Chi­nese govern­ment to get the best pos­si­ble out­come that we can,” he said in a Nine Net­work tele­vi­sion in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>While “there are ob­vi­ously ten­sions” in the re­la­tion­ship, he said they would not be “re­solved by Aus­tralia sur­ren­der­ing its sovereignt­y”.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said coal ship­ments were de­layed due to strength­en­ing of ex­am­i­na­tion and test­ing of the im­ports.</p>
    <p>“We found that many coal im­ports have failed to meet en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards,” he said at a press brief­ing, with­out specif­i­cally nam­ing Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>It would not be easy to mend ties: Mr Mor­ri­son’s min­is­ters have had no di­rect con­tact with their coun­ter­parts in Bei­jing since at least April. That was when Aus­tralia ex­ac­er­bated ex­ist­ing griev­ances with China by call­ing for in­de­pen­dent in­ves­ti­ga­tors to be al­lowed into Wuhan to probe the ori­gins of the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>As well as the dead­lock over Aus­tralian coal, Bei­jing has placed crip­pling tar­iffs on Aus­tralia’s bar­ley ex­ports, halted beef im­ports from sev­eral large Aus­tralian meat plants, warned its cit­i­zens against hol­i­day­ing or study­ing in Aus­tralia and or­dered traders to stop buy­ing at least seven com­modi­ties in­clud­ing cop­per and wine.</p>
    <p>China has be­come in­creas­ingly vo­cal in re­cent weeks in say­ing Aus­tralia is to blame for strained ties.</p>
    <p>“The root cause of the de­te­ri­o­rat­ing bi­lat­eral ties is Aus­tralia’s re­peated wrong acts and re­marks on is­sues con­cern­ing China’s core in­ter­ests and ma­jor con­cerns as well as its provoca­tive and con­fronta­tional ac­tions,” China’s em­bassy in Can­berra said i n a state­ment posted on its web­site on Monday.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son is seek­ing to create a buf­fer against what his govern­ment sees as an in­creas­ingly as­sertive China by bol­ster­ing mul­ti­lat­eral fo­rums of “like-minded” lib­eral democ­ra­cies in group­ings such as the Quad and Five Eyes.</p>
    <p>“Of course we want happy co-ex­is­tence and pos­i­tive re­la­tion­ship with China,” Mr Mor­ri­son said yes­ter­day, adding that it was “not sim­ple” to walk a mid­dle path be­tween China and the United States.</p>
    <p>“But we also have a won­der­ful al­liance with the US and a friend­ship with them as like-minded coun­tries with a sim­i­lar out­look with lib­eral demo­cratic val­ues,” he said. “And then we have our core na­tional in­ter­ests as well. And we want to see all those man­aged to­gether.”</p>
