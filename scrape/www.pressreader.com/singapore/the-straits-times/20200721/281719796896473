    <p>dus­try has been made a scape­goat for the fail­ure of the author­i­ties to track and con­tain the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Dr Masayuki Saijo, di­rec­tor of virol­ogy at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of In­fec­tious Dis­eases, said it was not ap­pro­pri­ate to dis­crim­i­nate against peo­ple based on where or when they work.</p>
    <p>“There’s no dif­fer­ence, work­ing at night or work­ing in the day,” Dr Saijo said. “The strat­egy to re­duce hu­man-to-hu­man in­fec­tion is the same.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kaori Ko­hga, rep­re­sen­ta­tive di­rec­tor of the Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion, told re­porters that her group has drafted its own safety rules for its mem­bers, in­clud­ing dis­in­fect­ing karaoke mi­cro­phones, as it found gov­ern­ment rec­om­men­da­tions, such as wear­ing masks and 2m so­cial dis­tanc­ing, were im­prac­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing will change if you’re only crit­i­cis­ing us as the bad guys,” she said, adding that the gov­ern­ment had not ac­knowl­edged the group’s rules nor of­fered enough fi­nan­cial help to busi­nesses or work­ers.</p>
    <p>JAKARTA • In­done­sia’s wide­spread use of rapid an­ti­body tests for Covid-19 as re­quire­ments for var­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties dur­ing the pan­demic has sparked con­cerns among ex­perts, who are call­ing for bet­ter gov­ern­ment con­trol over their use.</p>
    <p>Post-mar­ket sur­veil­lance on rapid an­ti­body test brands car­ried out by the As­so­ci­a­tion of In­done­sia’s Clin­i­cal Pathol­ogy and Lab­o­ra­tory Medicine spe­cial­ists (PDS PatKLIn) showed that many of them had sen­si­tiv­ity and speci­ficity lower than 50 per cent, as­so­ci­a­tion chair­man Ary­ati said.</p>
    <p>“With low sen­si­tiv­ity, chances of false neg­a­tives are high... while with low speci­ficity, chances for false pos­i­tives are high,” Pro­fes­sor Ary­ati, who is from Surabaya’s Air­langga Univer­sity, said.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s Covid-19 task force has rec­om­mended 155 brands from var­i­ous pro­duc­ers as of April 28. The team said it had re­ferred to a list is­sued by the World Health Or</p>
    <p>The city’s new coro­n­avirus cases have dropped be­low 200 for a sec­ond day, with 168 recorded yes­ter­day, even as in­fec­tions con­tinue to spread be­yond the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Re­ported cases are of­ten lower on Mon­days due to hos­pi­tals be­ing closed on the week­end, lead­ing to fewer tests be­ing con­ducted.</p>
    <p>The city re­ported 188 new cases on Sun­day and 290 last Satur­day, with the gov­ern­ment con­tend­ing that the in­creased num­ber of cases is partly due to more ag­gres­sive test­ing.</p>
    <p>Other pre­fec­tures have also been gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) and prod­ucts cer­ti­fied by bod­ies such as the Euro­pean Union and the United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The WHO did not en­dorse the brands, but rather, in­ven­to­ried lists from na­tional reg­u­la­tory agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Al­though the test kits’ vary­ing qual­ity was the main prob­lem, Prof Ary­ati said the ab­sence of train­ing for lab­o­ra­tory work­ers and how they car­ried out the tests also af­fected the tests’ ac­cu­racy.</p>
    <p>She pointed to ex­am­ples of how an in­cor­rect vol­ume of sam­ples taken, pro­longed time to in­ter­pret the re­sults and the sam­pling of cap­il­lary blood rather than ve­nous blood could lead to er­ro­neous re­sults.</p>
    <p>Many of those who had “non-re­ac­tive” test re­sults – in­di­cat­ing no virus ex­po­sure – also did not take an­other test within 10 days af­ter the first one, con­tra­ven­ing pre­vail­ing pro­to­col, Prof Ary­ati said.</p>
    <p>The PDS PatKLIn is­sued a rec­om­men­da­tion on July 6 for the re­port­ing in­fec­tion surges since the lift­ing of the state of emer­gency in May, rais­ing con­cern about the gov­ern­ment’s steps to thwart the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of cases in Ja­pan rose by 342 to 25,767 as of yes­ter­day evening.</p>
    <p>In a poll con­ducted last Satur­day, 64 per cent of re­spon­dents said the gov­ern­ment should de­clare a lo­calised state of emer­gency, with an­other 20 per cent call­ing for one na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 task force not to re­quire rapid tests for trav­ellers, say­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of false neg­a­tives and pos­i­tives “could have dan­ger­ous and harm­ful im­pacts”.</p>
    <p>It also rec­om­mended against re­quir­ing poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests as its sen­si­tiv­ity was only between 60 per cent and 80 per cent, and the time between tak­ing sam­ples and an­nounc­ing re­sults could be as long as three weeks.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 task force had on June 26 is­sued a cir­cu­lar re­quir­ing peo­ple trav­el­ling do­mes­ti­cally by land, sea or air to pre­sent proof of neg­a­tive PCR or non-re­ac­tive rapid test re­sults that are valid for 14 days.</p>
    <p>The PDS PatKLIn in­stead rec­om­mended us­ing rapid molec­u­lar tests PCR or anti­gen tests with sam­ples taken from trav­ellers at ports prior to de­par­ture, check­ing their body tem­per­a­ture and oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion, as well as en­sur­ing other health pro­to­cols and clean air cir­cu­la­tion on board.</p>
    <p>Prof Ary­ati said she hoped the gov­ern­ment would use a re­cent Health Min­istry study on the ac­cu­racy of rapid tests and her as­so­ci­a­tion’s post-mar­ket sur­veil­lance re­search to fur­ther short­list test kits al­lowed to be distribute­d, as op­posed to what she de­scribed as cur­rent “lax reg­u­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>“My con­cern is not only the trans­porta­tion. There are also rapid test re­quire­ments for some par­tic­i­pants of the state univer­sity en­trance ex­ams, or peo­ple will­ing to re­turn to of­fices. I think it is con­cern­ing and un­nec­es­sary,” Prof Ary­ati said.</p>
    <p>Even though rapid an­ti­body tests are not used for di­ag­no­sis, they have now be­come a com­mon re­quire­ment for some ac­tiv­i­ties in In­done­sia. Some hos­pi­tals have also used the tests to screen pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Rapid tests could aid con­tact trac­ing and sur­veil­lance ef­forts, but the ab­sence of reg­u­la­tions on who or which en­ti­ties can ad­min­is­ter the tests is a prob­lem, ac­cord­ing to epi­demi­ol­o­gist Tri Yu­nis Miko from the Univer­sity of In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“There should be reg­u­la­tions over­see­ing fa­cil­i­ties that of­fer rapid tests. All hos­pi­tals and clin­ics can of­fer such a ser­vice now, even small clin­ics, as long as they have med­i­cal staff,” he said.</p>
