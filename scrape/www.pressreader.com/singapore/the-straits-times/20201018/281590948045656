    <p>Malaysian po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim for his role in six cases, in­clud­ing the cir­cu­la­tion of a pur­ported list of Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment who he claimed are back­ing his bid to be­come prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Fed­eral Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment direc­tor Huzir Mo­hamed said that the po­lice recorded a state­ment from Datuk Seri An­war last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The former deputy prime min­is­ter is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for dis­turb­ing pub­lic or­der in re­la­tion to the list, among other things.</p>
    <p>The list pur­port­edly iden­ti­fies 121 MPs who are back­ing Mr An­war’s bid to form a new par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity and be­come Malaysia’s third prime min­is­ter this year.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin and his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) govern­ment hold a nar­row two-seat ma­jor­ity af­ter lead­ing mass de­fec­tions from the Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion to form the PN govern­ment in March.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral MPs, whose names were on the list, had lodged po­lice re­ports while deny­ing they backed Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>“So far, we have re­ceived 113 po­lice re­ports per­tain­ing to this mat­ter,” the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war is also be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for com­ments he had made at a press con­fer­ence af­ter an au­di­ence with Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>An­other sep­a­rate probe is for sodomy, an of­fence that Mr An­war has been con­victed of twice pre­vi­ously. The po­lice did not say what the sodomy in­ves­ti­ga­tion is about.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s au­di­ence with Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah did not im­me­di­ately re­sult in him suc­ceed­ing in his bid to be­come prime min­is­ter, with the King ex­pected to ver­ify his claims with sev­eral party lead­ers af­ter par­tial coro­n­avirus lock­downs end later this month.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war last Fri­day said that he re­fused to di­vulge the ac­tual list of his back­ers to the po­lice, as the mat­ter was be­tween him and the King.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace last Tues­day said that while Mr An­war did fur­nish the num­ber of MPs who pur­port­edly backed him, he did not dis­close the names of the MPs.</p>
