    <p>The fate of Wire­card’s 250 staff in Sin­ga­pore re­mains un­clear as the firm winds down pay­ment ser­vices af­ter be­ing or­dered to halt its core busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties here on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent and for­mer em­ploy­ees told The Straits Times that a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of staff have quit over the past month amid un­cer­tainty about the firm’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>A Wire­card spokesman de­clined to com­ment on the res­ig­na­tions but said the firm is con­tin­u­ing to ser­vice clients from its non-reg­u­lated busi­ness, such as tech­nol­ogy ser­vices.</p>
    <p>An em­ployee speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity told ST that staff have still not been told what will hap­pen to the Sin­ga­pore of­fice since the core busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties were halted, adding that no one has been laid off yet.</p>
    <p>The firm’s last town-hall ses­sion was held a few months ago when news broke that its par­ent com­pany in Ger­many had filed for in­sol­vency on June 25 af­ter ad­mit­ting that €1.9 bil­lion (S$3 bil­lion) in cash was miss­ing from its ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Wire­card Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing direc­tor Jef­fry Ho told staff at the time that there were in­ter­ested buy­ers and the busi­ness would con­tinue.</p>
    <p>But the shut­down of its core op­er­a­tions last month means em­ploy­ees are now un­sure how they will be de­ployed.</p>
    <p>“We were just left hang­ing; there wasn’t any com­mu­ni­ca­tion from man­age­ment,” the em­ployee said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is home to Wire­card’s Asia-Pa­cific head­quar­ters. At its peak, it em­ployed more than 350 peo­ple at its of­fice on the 14th floor of Maple­tree Busi­ness City, where the call cen­tre, sales de­ploy­ment team, re­gional com­mer­cial team and pro­ject man­age­ment of­fice are lo­cated.</p>
    <p>It now has 250 staff here – in­clud­ing 180 lo­cals. Cur­rent and for­mer em­ploy­ees told ST that they were shocked by the me­dia re­ports in June.</p>
    <p>“We were all very taken aback as to how this was hap­pen­ing,” said one of them.</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally a good place to work in. Very busi­ness-cen­tric and we did what­ever we could to im­prove the busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Mer­chants started ask­ing if their funds would be safe de­spite the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore telling the firm on June 30 to keep its clients’ cash in seg­re­gated ac­counts with banks here.</p>
    <p>Some staff be­gan look­ing for new jobs while some mer­chants de­cided to play it safe and jumped ship.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Aurobindo Ghosh from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Busi­ness noted: “Em­ploy­ees whose main job was to pro­vide cus­tomer ser­vice for cor­po­rate clients might be ab­sorbed by those clients... but non­tech­ni­cal em­ploy­ees might find it more chal­leng­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Mu­nich-based Ger­man pay­ment com­pany used to have 6,000 em­ploy­ees in 26 coun­tries. In Au­gust, around 730 staff – just over half its re­main­ing work­force – were laid off in Ger­many.</p>
