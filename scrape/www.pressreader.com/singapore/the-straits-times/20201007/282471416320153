    </section>

    <p>True wire­less in-ear head­phones (TWH) can cost as lit­tle as be­low $50 to as much as hun­dreds of dol­lars. The Straits Times rounds up nine TWH in three bud­get ranges.</p>
    <p>Priced at j ust un­der $100, the Aukey EP-N5 of­fers the best value for money. It has de­cent au­dio qual­ity, ANC and good bat­tery life.</p>
    <p>The earbuds l ook a tad like Ap­ple’s AirPods Pro, but with longer stems. And they are black. The build is quite pla­s­ticky and lacks the pre­mium feel of the AirPods Pro.</p>
    <p>Au­dio de­liv­ery is de­cent, but tends to be heavy on the bass side. The mids can be lost in the su­per­punchy bass, with the tre­ble sound­ing grainy.</p>
    <p>The ANC per­for­mance is not bad, though – it fil­ters out my loud air­con­di­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life is rated at seven hours with ANC off and 41/ hours with it</p>
    <p>2 on.</p>
    <p>If you are on a tight bud­get and like heavy bass, you can­not go wrong with the EP-N5.</p>
    <p>HUAWEI FREEBUDS 3I $128</p>
    <p>It might look like Ap­ple’s AirPods, with the white ex­te­rior (also avail­able in black) and long stems, but the Huawei FreeBuds 3i of­fers much more bang for the buck.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, it fea­tures ANC – not found in the AirPods. And the sil­i­cone ear tips are com­fort­able and help se­cure the earbuds in your ears.</p>
    <p>While au­dio qual­ity is de­cent, with clear mids and highs, there is a lack of rich­ness, and the bass lacks punch. But the ANC is quite im­pres­sive. It is able to cut out most noise, giv­ing most pricier com­peti­tors a run for their money.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life is pretty av­er­age at three hours of play­back with ANC on.</p>
    <p>XIAOMI MI TRUE WIRE­LESS EARBUDS BA­SIC S $39.90</p>
    <p>This is the cheap­est model here. And Xiaomi’s Mi True Wire­less Earbuds Ba­sic S is truly, well, ba­sic.</p>
    <p>The el­lip­ti­cal-shaped earbuds have a sin­gle big but­ton. There is no pro­trud­ing stem or bul­bous body. The buds fit nicely and com­fort­ably in the ears, as long as you find sil­i­cone ear tips of the right size.</p>
    <p>The sound­scape is very bassheavy – great for rock mu­sic fans or gamers who love thumps. But this drowns out the mids and highs.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the big­gest dis­ap­point­ment is the pair­ing process. It takes sev­eral tries be­fore the earbuds pair with the phone.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life is av­er­age at four hours on a full charge. And its charg­ing case still uses the slower mi­croUSB port in­stead of USB-C.</p>
