    <p>It is un­likely that Covid-19 can be spread through air-con­di­tion­ing, even if the virus caus­ing the dis­ease is air­borne, said in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­perts here.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, said yes­ter­day that fears of a pa­tient cough­ing in an of­fice build­ing and then spread­ing the virus through the air-con sys­tem have a low like­li­hood of be­ing re­alised.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a Straits Times we­bi­nar on Covid-19, he said that if a per­son ex­pels the coro­n­avirus into an aerosol which is then sucked into the build­ing’s air-con sys­tem, there would not be enough par­ti­cles for it to be spread through the air vent.</p>
    <p>“The en­tire process would have di­luted the virus so much that who­ever man­ages to in­hale it would not have enough par­ti­cles (in their sys­tem) to cause the in­fec­tion,” he added. The like­li­hood of vi­ral transmissi­on through the aerosol route is there­fore rather small.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said air­borne transmissi­on of the virus would not be a “ma­jor driver” of the dis­ease, though he ac­knowl­edged that the virus can be­come part of a fine spray in aerosol-gen­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures such as in­tu­bat­ing and den­tal work. Aerosols, de­fined as par­ti­cles that are less than five mi­crons in size, can in the­ory sus­pend and drift.</p>
    <p>But com­pared with com­mon air­borne in­fec­tious dis­eases such as chick­en­pox and measles which have re­pro­duc­tive num­bers, or R0s, of more than 10, the level of transmissi­on for the Covid-19 virus, which is gen­er­ally thought to have an R0 of 2.5, is not as high, said Prof Fisher.</p>
    <p>The trans­mis­si­bil­ity of a virus in a pop­u­la­tion de­pends on its R0 (pro­nounced “R-naught”).</p>
    <p>For in­stance, an R0 of one means each in­fected per­son will spread the dis­ease to one other per­son every se­rial in­ter­val, which is the du­ra­tion be­tween suc­ces­sive cases of transmissi­on.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing a study re­leased in pre­print on Wed­nes­day, where sci­en­tists found that air­borne coro­n­aviruses may be in­fec­tious, Prof Fisher, who also chairs the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Global Out­break Alert and Re­sponse Net­work, said the vi­ral load found in the droplets was very small and prob­a­bly be­low an “in­oc­u­lat­ing dose”, and not enough to cause dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said that for a dis­ease or an in­fec­tion to oc­cur, “a min­i­mum num­ber of viruses (have) to get into the body... How­ever, if there are not enough vi­ral par­ti­cles that get into the air­way, noth­ing is go­ing to hap­pen. So, that is why measles and chick­en­pox can be trans­mit­ted by the aerosol route be­cause you need so few par­ti­cles and you will still get the dis­ease”.</p>
    <p>There­fore, re­duc­ing the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sions still re­lies heav­ily on mea­sures such as mask wear­ing, phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing and good hy­giene, he added.</p>
