    <p>DBS has ap­plied to the High Court to wind up Novena Global Health­care, which is be­lieved to have owed the bank mil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>The firm will be put into liq­ui­da­tion if the High Court grants the ap­pli­ca­tion next month.</p>
    <p>Novena’s par­ent, Novena Global Health­care Group, which was in­cor­po­rated in the Cay­man Is­lands by Sin­ga­porean cousins Ter­ence and Nel­son Loh, has been un­der po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions for al­legedly us­ing unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures of ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young (EY) in fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>Po­lice de­clined to com­ment as in­ves­ti­ga­tions are still on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Novena Global Health­care has also breached Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity (Acra) reg­u­la­tions by fail­ing to file its an­nual re­turn.</p>
    <p>The re­turn has still not been filed de­spite warn­ings and en­force­ment ac­tion by Acra.</p>
    <p>An Acra spokesman told The Straits Times that the au­thor­ity will be tak­ing fur­ther ac­tion against Novena Global Health­care and Novena Life Sciences, which was also co-founded by the Loh cousins. This could re­sult in the com­pa­nies and the di­rec­tors be­ing pros­e­cuted.</p>
    <p>Acra has also found that six other en­ti­ties owned by the Loh cousins had not filed an­nual re­turns.</p>
    <p>En­force­ment ac­tion against them are on­go­ing, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The en­ti­ties in­clude Aes­thetic Med­i­cal Part­ners and Rock Star Ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>The Loh cousins made news in Au­gust with a £280 mil­lion (S$498 mil­lion) takeover bid for English Pre­mier League club New­cas­tle United. This bid was made un­der the Bel­la­graph Nova Group, which they founded with Chi­nese en­tre­pre­neur Evan­ge­line Shen, in July.</p>
    <p>The cousins have since parted ways.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh, 42, an­nounced a “sep­a­ra­tion agree­ment” en­tered into be­tween the cousins and for­mer busi­ness part­ners on Oct 6.</p>
    <p>It in­volves Mr Nel­son Loh, 40, trans­fer­ring all his shares in three en­ti­ties – Cay­man Is­lands-reg­is­tered Novena Global Health­care Group and all its units, Sin­ga­por­ereg­is­tered Dorr Global Health­care</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional, and Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered Rock Star Ad­vi­sors – to Ter­ence for $1.</p>
    <p>He will also re­sign as di­rec­tor of the en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>The ST re­ported pre­vi­ously that Acra searches showed Citibank reg­is­tered charges on Novena Ap­tus and Novena No­vap­tus on Feb 24 this year, a month af­ter the two com­pa­nies were in­cor­po­rated by the Loh cousins.</p>
    <p>A charge is usu­ally taken by a lender or cred­i­tor to se­cure re­pay­ment of a loan.</p>
    <p>Sources with knowl­edge of the loans said that Citibank lent the Loh cousins sev­eral mil­lion dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Citibank de­clined com­ment.</p>
