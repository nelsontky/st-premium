    <p>ROME • Fer­rari an­nounced a re­struc­tur­ing of their For­mula One tech­ni­cal depart­ment on Wed­nes­day, af­ter strug­gling in the first three races of a sea­son so far dom­i­nated again by Mercedes.</p>
    <p>The sport’s old­est, most glam­orous and suc­cess­ful team – last year’s run­ners-up – are fifth in the cham­pi­onship with Se­bas­tian Vet­tel and Charles Le­clerc pushed into more of a mid­field battle.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari said in a state­ment that the team would have a more fo­cused and sim­pli­fied chain of com­mand, with the heads of each depart­ment given “the nec­es­sary pow­ers to achieve their ob­jec­tives”.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian team said En­rico Cardile would head a new per­for­mance de­vel­op­ment depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Other roles stay the same, with En­rico Gualtieri over­see­ing the power unit, Lau­rent Mekies re­main­ing as sport­ing di­rec­tor in charge of track­side ac­tiv­i­ties and Si­mone Resta head of chas­sis engi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>“We are mak­ing changes to the tech­ni­cal side of the or­gan­i­sa­tion so as to speed up the de­sign and de­vel­op­ment on the car per­for­mance front,” said prin­ci­pal Mat­tia Binotto.</p>
    <p>“The depart­ment run by En­rico Cardile will be able to count on the ex­pe­ri­ence of Rory Byrne and es­tab­lished en­gi­neers such as David Sanchez. It will be the cor­ner­stone of the car’s de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>South African de­signer Byrne, 76, was a key fig­ure dur­ing Fer­rari’s golden era in the early years of the cen­tury with seven-time cham­pion Michael Schu­macher, in a team led by Jean Todt with Ross Brawn as tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari have not won a drivers’ ti­tle since Kimi Raikko­nen’s suc­cess in 2007 while their last con­struc­tors’ crown was in 2008.</p>
    <p>Vet­tel, a four-time world cham­pion with Red Bull, is leav­ing at the end of the year with Mone­gasque Le­clerc the face of the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Binotto said Fer­rari had to “make a de­ci­sive change, rais­ing the bar in terms of the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of the depart­ment heads”.</p>
    <p>“We have started to lay the foun­da­tions of a process which should lead to a new and en­dur­ing win­ning cy­cle,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It will take some time and we will suf­fer set­backs like the one we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing right now in terms of re­sults and per­for­mance.”</p>
