    <p>En­force­ment ac­tions by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) have en­sured that fi­nan­cial crim­i­nals pay a heavy price.</p>
    <p>They have re­sulted in nine crim­i­nal con­vic­tions and $11.7 mil­lion in civil penal­ties in the 18 months to June this year.</p>
    <p>The MAS has also im­posed $3.3 mil­lion in com­po­si­tion penal­ties for money laun­der­ing-re­lated con­trol breaches.</p>
    <p>It is­sued 25 pro­hi­bi­tion or­ders against un­fit rep­re­sen­ta­tives of fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, ac­cord­ing to its en­force­ment re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age time taken by the MAS to com­plete its re­views and investigat­ions short­ened from 33 months to 24 months in crim­i­nal cases, and from 30 months to 26 months in civil penalty cases, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous 18-month pe­riod.</p>
    <p>MAS ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor (en­force­ment) Peggy Pao said: “As our fi­nan­cial sec­tor grows in scale and so­phis­ti­ca­tion, a ro­bust en­force­ment regime will be crit­i­cal in sus­tain­ing Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion as a trusted fi­nan­cial cen­tre.”</p>
    <p>In the four years since a cen­tralised En­force­ment De­part­ment was es­tab­lished, the MAS has deep­ened its en­force­ment ca­pa­bil­ity and ex­per­tise, she noted.</p>
    <p>“Rig­or­ous in­ves­ti­ga­tion and tough en­force­ment are nec­es­sary to de­ter fi­nan­cial mis­con­duct, pro­tect con­sumers and main­tain in­vestor con­fi­dence,” she said.</p>
    <p>The re­port said the suc­cess­ful crim­i­nal con­vic­tions were the re­sult of col­lab­o­ra­tion with the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers.</p>
    <p>There had been just one con­vic­tion in the ear­lier re­port­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The MAS’ En­force­ment De­part­ment has also forged closer part­ner­ships with other public agen­cies, such as the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment, the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity, and the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bu­reau. These part­ner­ships helped with its re­views or investigat­ions in sev­eral com­plex cases, in­clud­ing mat­ters re­lated to Wire­card, Ea­gle Hospi­tal­ity Trust and Hyflux.</p>
    <p>The MAS and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change also j ointly pub­lished a trade sur­veil­lance prac­tice guide to help bro­kers im­ple­ment good prac­tices in their trade sur­veil­lance op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The MAS’ en­force­ment regime is also sup­ple­mented by close co­or­di­na­tion with its coun­ter­parts in the In­ter­na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Se­cu­ri­ties Com­mis­sions net­work, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>The MAS will con­tinue to strengthen its en­force­ment regime, as the na­ture of fi­nan­cial mis­con­duct grows in so­phis­ti­ca­tion and com­plex­ity, the re­port added.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tory au­thor­ity will also con­tinue to re­fine its pro­cesses and in­creas­ingly tap tech­nol­ogy to boost ef­fec­tive­ness and ef­fi­ciency in investigat­ions.</p>
    <p>The en­force­ment re­port show­cased a few ex­am­ples of suc­cess­ful in­ves­ti­ga­tion and con­vic­tions in cases re­lated to mar­ket abuse, fi­nan­cial ser­vice mis­con­duct and money laun­der­ing-re­lated con­trol breaches in the re­port­ing pe­riod be­tween Jan­uary last year and June this year.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, the MAS im­posed a civil penalty of $11.2 mil­lion on Swiss bank UBS for de­cep­tive trades by its client ad­vis­ers that con­tra­vened Sec­tion 201(b) of the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act.</p>
    <p>The client ad­vis­ers en­gaged in acts that de­ceived or were likely to de­ceive clients about the spreads or in­ter-bank prices for trans­ac­tions in over-the-counter bonds and struc­tured prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>UBS ad­mit­ted li­a­bil­ity and agreed to com­pen­sate all af­fected clients man­aged by UBS’ Sin­ga­pore branch. Mean­while, investigat­ions into the in­di­vid­u­als in­volved in the mis­con­duct are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore’s first case of fron­trun­ning pros­e­cuted as an in­sider trad­ing of­fence last year, two se­nior eq­uity deal­ers with First State In­vest­ments (Sin­ga­pore) and a UOB Kay Hian remisier were given 20 months’ to 36 months’ im­pris­on­ment and 13 years’ to 15 years’ pro­hi­bi­tion or­ders.</p>
