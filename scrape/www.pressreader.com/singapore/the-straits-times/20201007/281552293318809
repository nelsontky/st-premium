    <p>Olympic cham­pion Joseph School­ing showed his strokes with a rolling pin yes­ter­day as he made Neo Gar­den’s curry bombs to raise funds for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund and the Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion. While he did not eat one, he re­vealed that his last cheat meal was hokkien mee.</p>
    <p>It is Tues­day af­ter­noon in a kitchen in Jurong and Joseph School­ing is bat­tling an ob­sti­nate ri­val. Swim­mers are eas­ier to flat­ten than the dough be­fore him. He might be a nat­u­ral in the wa­ter, but on land his stroke with the rolling pin needs a lit­tle tech­ni­cal work.</p>
    <p>School­ing is at the head­quar­ters of cater­ers Neo Gar­den to help in a won­der­ful cause. His hosts and the Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) have banded to­gether to raise funds for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund and the SSA and this was the launch of their drive.</p>
    <p>The idea was neat: Get an ex­plo­sive tal­ent to make a curry bomb. So they clad a usu­ally un­der­dressed School­ing in gloves, mask, cap and gown for hy­giene rea­sons and let him play among the pots and pans.</p>
    <p>The curry bomb is a gi­ant dome­sized bun with a pot of curry chicken within. Think of it as a gift wrapped in bread, which can feed a fam­ily of four or one glut­ton. The box which con­tains it lists the steps on how to eat it and be­fit­ting a dish named af­ter an in­cen­di­ary de­vice it comes with gloves in­cluded. Best to be care­ful.</p>
    <p>School­ing can of­fer a cause many things, but he was giv­ing this his most precious one – his time. Later this month he flies to the US to re­sume train­ing with coach Ser­gio Lopez, but ath­letes al­ways have time for food for it sus­tains them. And School­ing swims the butterfly which, by the way, is a term for a very spe­cific way to cut meat.</p>
    <p>Food is an ath­letic fas­ci­na­tion. Gym­nasts peck at their plates, weightlift­ers eat the oc­cu­pants of en­tire chicken coops and base­baller Babe Ruth’s size­able ap­petite was pro­filed in an ar­ti­cle bril­liantly ti­tled The Sul­tan Of Swal­low. Bjorn Frantzen, who played foot­ball for AIK in Swe­den, had such fine taste buds that he started a restau­rant which now has three Miche­lin stars.</p>
    <p>School­ing, wear­ing a smile and a slim look, learned how to whip up pasta and an av­o­cado-rich break­fast dur­ing his days in Amer­ica – “I like the tran­quil­lity of cook­ing,” he says – but does less of his culi­nary work now. And there’s a lot to be done for like a re­fu­elling jet he eats four to five meals a day (soft-boiled eggs, salmon, chicken breast, buck­wheat noo­dles) and is trailed con­stantly by a box of blue­ber­ries.</p>
    <p>His Olympic gold in 2016 was won af­ter a fi­nal meal of ce­real, milk and fruit and af­ter some rapid men­tal maths he re­vealed that of 28 meals a week he al­lows him­self only three cheat meals. The last one? Hokkien mee. But it’s best he only cooks the curry bomb and doesn’t eat it, for as he says, “I’m not sure my nu­tri­tion­ist would be too happy.”</p>
    <p>If there was a light-hearted air in the build­ing, there was also the pow­er­ful smell of gen­eros­ity. Neo Gar­den is the SSA’s of­fi­cial food and bev­er­age part­ner and Neo Kah Kiat, the founder and chair­man of the group, said his com­pany has a “strong cul­ture of giv­ing”.</p>
    <p>Proof was in his num­bers. When the fund raiser was be­ing dis­cussed, he thought, “Why don’t I do­nate 10,000 curry bombs so you can raise money” and thus a fine idea was born.</p>
    <p>Each curry bomb costs $18.80 and the fund-rais­ing drive which be­gan yes­ter­day stretches till the end of the year. To buy one is to help a needy stu­dent or a strug­gling swim­ming coach. All it re­quires is ef­fort, which is what School­ing was putting in.</p>
    <p>Great ath­letes are suck­ers for a scrap and for School­ing it was with the dough. Even in the kitchen his com­pet­i­tive­ness flared and his fo­cus sharp­ened. Later he said the process was te­dious and that he had to be pa­tient and his words were un­canny. For they were a per­fect de­scrip­tion of swim­ming con­stantly up and down a lane ev­ery day.</p>
