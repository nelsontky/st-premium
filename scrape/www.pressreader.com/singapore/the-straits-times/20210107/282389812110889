    <p>PARIS • Mauri­cio Pochet­tino has in­sisted that “any big player in the world is al­ways wel­come at Paris Saint-Ger­main”, as the new coach of the French cham­pi­ons an­swered ques­tions about the pos­si­bil­ity of a sen­sa­tional move for his com­pa­triot Lionel Messi.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian was asked sev­eral times about the Barcelona cap­tain at his first press con­fer­ence since be­ing named coach of PSG.</p>
    <p>While Messi has said he will not de­cide un­til the sum­mer, he is now free to ne­go­ti­ate with other clubs as his con­tract runs out in June.</p>
    <p>“To be hon­est, we are not talk­ing about that, it has been a crazy pe­riod for us, try­ing to adapt to a new club with meet­ings, train­ing, pre­par­ing for the game (at Saint-Eti­enne yes­ter­day) which is the main ob­jec­tive,” said Pochet­tino.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to have time to talk in the fu­ture, but any big player in the world is al­ways wel­come at Paris Saint-Ger­main.”</p>
    <p>Ney­mar set tongues wag­ging last month when he spoke of his de­sire to team up again with Messi, his former team­mate at Barcelona.</p>
    <p>If that hap­pens, then it seems more likely to be in Paris than</p>
    <p>Barcelona, with the Cata­lans strug­gling fi­nan­cially.</p>
    <p>In the short term, other names linked with PSG in the Jan­u­ary win­dow in­clude Dele Alli and In­ter Mi­lan’s Chris­tian Erik­sen, both of whom played un­der Pochet­tino at Tot­ten­ham. But the 48-year-old was tight-lipped about new faces ar­riv­ing this month.</p>
    <p>“They are ru­mours, and the re­al­ity is we have just ar­rived and are work­ing with play­ers who are here,” he said. “The cur­rent re­al­ity is com­pli­cated and across the world we are all suf­fer­ing.”</p>
    <p>On his re­turn to PSG, where he played from 2001 to 2003, Pochet­tino, who spent over a year out of the game af­ter his ax­ing by Spurs, added: “Fa­ther Christ­mas was good to give me this op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“We are very much aware of the size of the chal­lenge here. There is big pres­sure be­cause this is one of the big­gest clubs in the world.</p>
    <p>“We’re re­ally con­fi­dent, we have an un­be­liev­able squad, we have the aim of win­ning but Barca is one of the great clubs in the world and it’s (the Cham­pi­ons League last-16 tie) go­ing to be tough.”</p>
