    <p>The Na­tional Day ob­ser­vance cer­e­mony at the Is­tana yes­ter­day was a smaller, qui­eter af­fair due to Covid-19. Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob and Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong were joined by the Is­tana’s and Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice staff, in­clud­ing (left) Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Tan Kee Yong. PM Lee wrote in a Facebook post: “We sang Ma­ju­lah Sin­ga­pura and re­cited our Pledge in our hearts... which only made it a more heart­felt and poignant cer­e­mony.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is far from over and stay­ing united can help Sin­ga­pore over­come the cri­sis, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said in a video mes­sage ahead of Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>“There will be dif­fi­cul­ties ahead for com­pa­nies, work­ers and fam­i­lies. We all need to look for ways to over­come the chal­lenges in­di­vid­u­ally and col­lec­tively,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It will not be easy, hence the rea­son why we need to stay to­gether and mount a united front. I am con­fi­dent that to­gether, we can emerge as a stronger Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah added that Sin­ga­pore’s 55th birth­day would have been a mile­stone and a cause for great cel­e­bra­tion if not for the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Although this year’s Na­tional Day fes­tiv­i­ties have to be very dif­fer­ent from the years be­fore, I hope our spir­its will not be damp­ened,” she said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s progress as a na­tion over the years has been a strong buf­fer against the up­heaval Covid-19 has caused, she noted, adding that it has still taken “all our strength and re­sources to mount an emer­gency re­sponse to this global chal­lenge”.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah also thanked front-line work­ers for their re­lent­less ef­forts in help­ing to sta­bilise the sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore, and said she was heart­ened by Sin­ga­pore­ans com­ing to­gether and mo­bil­is­ing re­sources to help one an­other dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen led about 3,000 Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) and Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces per­son­nel to re­cite the Pledge and sing the Na­tional An­them yes­ter­day morn­ing dur­ing Min­def’s Na­tional Day ob­ser­vance cer­e­mony. It was held vir­tu­ally via video con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>In his Na­tional Day mes­sage to stu­dents de­liv­ered yes­ter­day, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong noted that stu­dents have re­sponded with re­silience and courage to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“This cri­sis, and every cri­sis be­fore, has shown us that be­ing Sin­ga­porean means unit­ing and sup­port­ing each other. We have over­come dif­fi­cult times be­fore,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I am con­fi­dent that you will rise to this chal­lenge to build a bet­ter home in Sin­ga­pore. To­gether, and only to­gether, can we be a stronger Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual Na­tional Day ob­ser­vance cer­e­mony held for pub­lic of­fi­cers based in The Trea­sury, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat thanked the of­fi­cers for their work.</p>
    <p>He high­lighted the ef­forts of those at The Trea­sury, which in­cluded pre­par­ing four Bud­gets within 100 days, work­ing tire­lessly to mit­i­gate the pan­demic’s im­pact on busi­nesses and jobs, and cre­at­ing jobs and trainee­ships for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>At the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment’s vir­tual ob­ser­vance cer­e­mony, Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee cau­tioned that the worst of the pan­demic may be yet to come.</p>
    <p>“We will have to steel our­selves, rein­vig­o­rate and re-en­er­gise our­selves, and be ready to do bat­tle on mul­ti­ple fronts,” he said.</p>
    <p>While ac­knowl­edg­ing that the fight against Covid-19 has been tir­ing and drain­ing, he said “the way we re­spond to this in­cred­i­ble cri­sis may well de­ter­mine the course of our lives, and the fu­ture of our chil­dren and our grand­chil­dren”.</p>
    <p>A STRONGER SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>This cri­sis, and every cri­sis be­fore, has shown us that be­ing Sin­ga­porean means unit­ing and sup­port­ing each other. We have over­come dif­fi­cult times be­fore. I am con­fi­dent that you will rise to this chal­lenge to build a bet­ter home in Sin­ga­pore. To­gether, and only to­gether, can we be ’’ a stronger Sin­ga­pore. ED­U­CA­TION MIN­IS­TER LAWRENCE WONG, in his Na­tional Day mes­sage to stu­dents.</p>
