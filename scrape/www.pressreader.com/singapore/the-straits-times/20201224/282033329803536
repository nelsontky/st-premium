    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic hit ear­lier this year, 14-year-old Ai­man would lace up his football boots at least once a week to take to the pitch at the New Charis Mis­sion for a train­ing ses­sion at the Foot­bal­lPlus Academy.</p>
    <p>The academy is the brain­child of Mr Loh Ngiap Tai, who in 2013 saw a chance to merge his life­long love of football with his pas­sion for help­ing young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In his pre­vi­ous job run­ning lead­er­ship pro­grammes for at-risk youth at char­i­ta­ble or­gan­i­sa­tion YouthWorks, he saw how they strug­gled with con­fi­dence and dis­ci­pline be­cause they lacked op­por­tu­ni­ties to ex­plore phys­i­cal and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A cer­ti­fied “A” li­cence coach, the 46-year-old founded Foot­bal­lPlus, an academy that uses football to en­gage youth from dis­ad­van­taged and low-in­come fam­i­lies and “teach them pos­i­tive val­ues”.</p>
    <p>Foot­bal­lPlus re­ceived its char­ity sta­tus in June 2014 and at­tained In­sti­tu­tion of a Pub­lic Char­ac­ter sta­tus in Au­gust 2016.</p>
    <p>Its com­mu­nity pro­gramme in­cludes 70 youth aged seven to 14, of which 90 per cent train weekly for free or at sub­sidised monthly rates of $ 20. Coaches are en­cour­aged to do home vis­its to con­nect with par­tic­i­pants’ par­ents and un­der­stand their home en­vi­ron­ment, so that youth are given the sup­port they need.</p>
    <p>Foot­bal­lPlus also runs football clin­ics at fam­ily ser­vices cen­tres and school-based pro­grammes. It pro­vides coaches to schools and de­liv­ers ad hoc football-based parenting work­shops.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh said: “I want to help them build char­ac­ter through ex­po­sure to train­ing and com­pe­ti­tion be­cause I be­lieve early in­ter­ven­tion helps them later on in life.</p>
    <p>“Over the years, it has been re­ward­ing to see them grow... We have kids who were very ill-dis­ci­plined, al­ways late and fight­ing in school and in train­ing, and we are very en­cour­aged when we see their trans­for­ma­tion into some­one who finds joy and even helps out the coaches dur­ing train­ing.”</p>
    <p>Bud­ding mid­fielder Ai­man, who is iden­ti­fied only by his first name and has trained for five years with Foot­bal­lPlus, said: “It has been a great ex­pe­ri­ence, we get to meet new friends and train with friendly coaches.</p>
    <p>“The coaches here teach us val­ues like re­silience, team spirit, fin­ish­ing well, serv­ing oth­ers and self-con­trol, which we can ap­ply in games and in life.”</p>
    <p>Foot­bal­lPlus also runs Cham­pi­ons Un­lim­ited, a 16-week men­tor­ing pro­gramme where par­tic­i­pants re­ceive one-on-one men­tor</p>
    <p>ing ses­sions ev­ery other week. These ses­sions are to en­cour­age and fa­cil­i­tate goal-set­ting, cel­e­brate suc­cesses, re­flect and re­view the par­tic­i­pants’ de­ci­sion-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>It is also a learn­ing op­por­tu­nity for the men­tors, most of whom are vol­un­teers, as they have to un­dergo eight hours of manda­tory train­ing, which in­cludes learn­ing prac­ti­cal ways to han­dle some of the is­sues youth face.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme was halted dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but is set to restart next year.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho Wen Jin, 28, who has been a Foot­bal­lPlus coach for six years, said: “With Foot­bal­lPlus, I see its mis­sion clearly, and I get tremen­dous sat­is­fac­tion from watch­ing kids, who start off with no con­fi­dence be­cause they don’t have the op­por­tu­nity to play, grow grad­u­ally over the years and de­velop pos­i­tive qual­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>The coaches here teach us val­ues like re­silience, team spirit, fin­ish­ing well, serv­ing oth­ers and self-con­trol, which we can ap­ply in games and in life.</p>
