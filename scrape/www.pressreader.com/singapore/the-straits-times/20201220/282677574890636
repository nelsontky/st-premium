    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has hit many busi­nesses this year, but one change that has also reached con­sumers is banks cut­ting their in­ter­est rates on sav­ings ac­counts.</p>
    <p>This was the in­evitable re­sult of a low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment, the banks said.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of de­posits Gregory Cher says: “The mul­ti­ple Fed­eral Open Mar­ket Com­mit­tee cuts from last year and this year have re­sulted in the cur­rent low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“The Fed­eral Re­serve cut Amer­i­can in­ter­est rates to zero to mit­i­gate the eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic. We have thus had to make changes to our prod­ucts in line with the in­ter­est rate.”</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore said in its an­nual Fi­nan­cial Sta­bil­ity Re­view re­leased this month that banks have so far re­mained gen­er­ally re­silient de­spite the shock of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But it added that banks are likely to face chal­leng­ing op­er­at­ing con­di­tions in the near term, with fac­tors like the prolonged low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment weigh­ing on their prof­itabil­ity.</p>
    <p>The three lo­cal banks have also ad­justed their in­ter­est rates. Some also cut in­ter­est mul­ti­ple times through­out the year, with the lat­est round of changes for DBS Bank’s flag­ship Mul­ti­plier ac­count to take ef­fect from Jan 1 next year.</p>
    <p>OCBC</p>
    <p>De­spite cut­ting the rates for some cat­e­gories, the OCBC 360 ac­count re­vised its in­ter­est rate scheme to al­low cus­tomers to earn more max­i­mum in­ter­est over­all.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers can now earn up to 2.68 per cent an­nual in­ter­est on the first $75,000 of their sav­ings bal­ance. This was re­vised in Oc­to­ber – the third re­vi­sion this year – from 2.15 per cent on the first $70,000.</p>
    <p>Bonus in­ter­est is paid on the ac­count bal­ance when var­i­ous cri­te­ria are met, such as salary cred­it­ing into this ac­count and sav­ing at least $500 a month.</p>
    <p>Bonus in­ter­est rates on the first $25,000 in ac­count bal­ance, when the cus­tomer cred­its his salary, dou­bles for the next $25,000. This base rate of 0.4 per cent is then tripled on the next $25,000.</p>
    <p>There were two tiers of $35,000 each pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, where there was pre­vi­ously a sin­gle bonus for buy­ing an el­i­gi­ble in­vest­ment or in­surance prod­uct from OCBC, cus­tomers can now earn bonuses on both com­po­nents. So, a cus­tomer who cred­its his salary of at least $1,800 and saves $500 will get an in­ter­est rate of 1.08 per cent.</p>
    <p>But if he also in­vests or in­sures with OCBC, he can earn 1.88 per cent in­ter­est. If he does both, on top of cred­it­ing salary and sav­ing, his to­tal in­ter­est is 2.68 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Cher says the ex­pan­sion of the wealth bonus in­ter­est en­ables cus­tomers to earn twice as much bonus in­ter­est. “The bonus in­ter­est continues to be at­trac­tive to cus­tomers who want a daily op­er­at­ing ac­count that re­wards them for their bank­ing trans­ac­tions.”</p>
    <p>UOB</p>
    <p>The UOB One ac­count also re­vised its rates thrice this year. The max­i­mum ef­fec­tive in­ter­est rate was cut from 2.44 per cent in March to 1.8 per cent in May, then slashed to 1.2 per cent in Au­gust and fi­nally 1 per cent last month.</p>
    <p>Th­ese rate re­duc­tions are still smaller than the de­clines in the three-month Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate (Si­bor), which be­gan in June last year, along­side rate cuts by the US Fed­eral Re­serve.</p>
    <p>UOB head of group per­sonal fi­nan­cial ser­vices Jacquelyn Tan says that mil­len­nial cus­tomers make up more than half of the UOB One ac­count hold­ers, and they have con­tin­ued to grow their sav­ings de­spite the trou­bled year.</p>
    <p>“Among the dif­fer­ent age groups, our cus­tomers who are un­der 30 have in­creased their sav­ings fastest with the UOB One ac­count, grow­ing their aver­age ac­count bal­ances by more than 20 per cent year on year as at end Septem­ber,” she says. To qual­ify for bonus in­ter­est, a cus­tomer has to spend at least $500 with his UOB One credit card or debit card, among other el­i­gi­ble cards. He can earn the max­i­mum ef­fec­tive in­ter­est rate of 1 per cent by cred­it­ing monthly salary of $2,000 or more, or by mak­ing three Giro debit trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore said in its an­nual Fi­nan­cial Sta­bil­ity Re­view re­leased this month that banks have so far re­mained gen­er­ally re­silient de­spite the shock of the pan­demic. But it added that banks are likely to face chal­leng­ing op­er­at­ing con­di­tions in the near term, with fac­tors like the prolonged low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment weigh­ing on their prof­itabil­ity.</p>
    <p>DBS</p>
    <p>DBS has re­vised its DBS Mul­ti­plier ac­count twice since May. Its cus­tomers can now earn in­ter­est of up to 3.8 per cent by cred­it­ing their salary and per­form­ing trans­ac­tions un­der four other cat­e­gories: credit card spend­ing, pay­ing home loan in­stal­ments, and buy­ing in­surance and in­vest­ment prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>But the bonus in­ter­est rates will be cut from Jan 1. For in­stance, a cus­tomer who earns around $4,100 and makes trans­ac­tions in two cat­e­gories of $1,800 will get about 0.8 per cent in bonus in­ter­est per year on the first $50,000 of his ac­count bal­ance, against the cur­rent 1.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim Bee Bee, DBS Con­sumer Bank­ing Group (Sin­ga­pore) head of mar­ket­ing and cus­tomer man­age­ment, says ac­count hold­ers can in­crease their in­ter­est rate earn­ings through com­ple­men­tary in­vest­ment in­stru­ments.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, they can con­sider reg­u­lar sav­ings plans such as DBS In­vest-Saver where in­vest­ment in ex­change traded funds or unit trusts can start from as lit­tle as $100 a month.</p>
