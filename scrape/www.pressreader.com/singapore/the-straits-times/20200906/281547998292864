    <p>Amid the eco­nomic cri­sis brought on by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, white-col­lar work­ers used to job se­cu­rity are fac­ing grow­ing un­cer­tainty, reignit­ing once again the is­sue of for­eign­ers com­pet­ing for jobs. In Sin­ga­pore, the is­sue was dis­sected in Par­lia­ment last week dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>2 What do work­ers, busi­nesses say?</p>
    <p>Lo­cal job seek­ers lament that job op­por­tu­ni­ties are lost to for­eign com­peti­tors, but hir­ing is rarely made solely on the ba­sis of na­tion­al­ity, firms and trade cham­bers say.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment last week, sev­eral MPs raised con­cerns about a high con­cen­tra­tion of for­eign­ers in some sec­tors, such as fi­nan­cial ser­vices and in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions and tech­nol­ogy, and the anx­i­eties of work­ers who feel that they are los­ing out to for­eign pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC MP Joan Pereira shared the story of a PMET (pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive or tech­ni­cian) em­ployee who was re­trenched, but later found out that her job was given to a for­eigner who per­formed all the same tasks that she used to do in her com­pany.</p>
    <p>Labour MP Pa­trick Tay said at least 20 PMEs have writ­ten to him in the past month, about their loss of op­por­tu­ni­ties in tak­ing on jobs and at work­places, to the ex­tent of feel­ing dis­crim­i­nated against.</p>
    <p>“I can­not help but won­der if, as a re­sult of unchecked con­scious and un­con­scious bias, there may still be in­stances of na­tion­al­ity bias in hir­ing and pro­mo­tion and in today’s con­text, re­trench­ments?” he said.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is, left unchecked, this would ex­ac­er­bate the glass-ceil­ing ef­fect and job op­por­tu­nity is­sues for our Sin­ga­porean PMEs.”</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ anx­i­eties over job se­cu­rity are in­ten­si­fied by the global eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and pan­demic sit­u­a­tion, and some lo­cal job seek­ers have ex­pressed con­cerns that they are not given a fair op­por­tu­nity at pre­cious open­ings.</p>
    <p>Poli­cies have been put in place and tight­ened in re­cent times to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans are given a level play­ing field to com­pete on: the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF), which man­dates that em­ploy­ers con­sider Sin­ga­pore­ans fairly for job op­por­tu­ni­ties be­fore hir­ing Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers, was tight­ened in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>But while dis­crim­i­na­tion is an is­sue – some 400 firms are cur­rently on the FCF watch list for rea­sons re­lated to for­eign hir­ing prac­tices – it is skill sets, rather than na­tion­al­ity, that is the main con­sid­er­a­tion in hir­ing, ac­cord­ing to sev­eral small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) and trade cham­bers The Sun­day Times spoke to.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean-Ger­man Cham­ber of In­dus­try and Com­merce pres­i­dent Jens Rub­bert notes: “When I talk to our mem­ber com­pa­nies, they al­ways try to fill va­can­cies with Sin­ga­pore­ans first, and only if this is not pos­si­ble, they do look for ex­perts and man­agers from other coun­tries, such as Ger­many.”</p>
    <p>For ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence so­lu­tions firm ViSenze, a lo­cal SME, the fo­cus is on skill sets and ex­per­tise, and its pref­er­ence is al­ways for “in­coun­try tal­ent”.</p>
    <p>This does not nec­es­sar­ily mean just hir­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs), but tal­ents that are al­ready work­ing or study­ing in Sin­ga­pore, says chief ex­ec­u­tive Oliver Tan.</p>
    <p>This pref­er­ence is be­cause they are al­ready cul­tur­ally ac­cli­ma­tised to Sin­ga­pore, and it is also in the coun­try’s in­ter­ests to re­tain promis­ing tech tal­ent here, he adds.</p>
