    <p>F. Scott Fitzger­ald’s The Great Gatsby, pub­lished in 1925 by the dis­tin­guished New York im­print Charles Scrib­ner’s Sons, ends with a re­flec­tion on Gatsby’s doomed at­tempt to re­cover the love of his youth. “So we beat on, boats against the cur­rent, drawn back cease­lessly into the past.”</p>
    <p>Tay­lor Swift is also an­guished about her past: “It pains me very deeply to re­main sep­a­rated from the mu­sic I spent over a decade cre­at­ing,” the singer told Sham­rock Cap­i­tal, the fund that has bought the mas­ters of her first six al­bums for US$300 mil­lion (S$403.3 mil­lion). She hopes to re­cap­ture it by record­ing the songs again.</p>
    <p>That deal and news that pub­lish­ers are lin­ing up to buy Si­mon & Schus­ter, the par­ent com­pany of Scrib­ner, from Vi­a­comCBS for US$1.7 bil­lion re­flect starkly on pub­lish­ing and mu­sic’s ob­ses­sion with new hits. The re­li­a­bil­ity of Si­mon & Schus­ter’s back­list and Swift’s songs is what makes them so valu­able.</p>
    <p>Edi­tors in pub­lish­ing houses and ex­ec­u­tives at mu­sic la­bels spend their ca­reers try­ing to sign de­but au­thors and new bands. But they may now be fo­cused on the wrong thing, given that the value of fa­mil­iar songs and books is grow­ing as in­vestors are drawn back in­creas­ingly into the past.</p>
    <p>The two ac­tiv­i­ties – launch­ing new acts and ex­ploit­ing rights to the ones on the books – used to fit to­gether well at pub­lish­ers and recorded mu­sic la­bels.</p>
    <p>The “artists and reper­toire” ex­ec­u­tives who toured clubs in search of the next Rolling Stones or Tay­lor Swift lived more lav­ishly than book edi­tors, but their task was sim­i­lar.</p>
    <p>STREAM­ING SER­VICES</p>
    <p>The bal­ance is threat­ened in mu­sic be­cause stream­ing makes the back cat­a­logue more po­tent.</p>
    <p>Swift is not the only star to wish she had not signed away so many rights when she was younger and a chance of fame came knock­ing: Kanye West wants his own mas­ters back and has de­nounced mu­sic la­bels as “mod­ern day slave ships”.</p>
    <p>As live per­for­mance – which has be­come a big slice of mu­si­cians’ in­come – is halted by the pan­demic, stars have looked more closely at what their record­ings are worth.</p>
    <p>They have re­alised that be­ing paid a small amount per stream on Spo­tify, rather than a larger one-off fee for an al­bum sale, favours ev­er­greens over pass­ing hits.</p>
    <p>The ef­fect grows as more mid­dle-aged peo­ple sub­scribe to stream­ing ser­vices: If you want to be rein­tro­duced to Joni Mitchell’s 1974 al­bum Court And Spark, as I did this week, it is sim­ple.</p>
    <p>Nos­tal­gia is re­in­forced by be­ing at home more: Streams of the top 200 songs on Spo­tify fell in spring amid lock­down, while cat­a­logue lis­ten­ing rose.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy, mean­while, makes it eas­ier to in­vest in known as­sets rather than mak­ing a bet on untested acts.</p>
    <p>Hipg­no­sis Songs Fund, an in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle listed on the Lon­don Stock Ex­change, says it made an av­er­age of £4,868 (S$8,687) per song last year, com­pared with less than £150 at ma­jor la­bels; it helps to know what you are buy­ing. The same thing is oc­cur­ring in pub­lish­ing, al­beit in a more stately man­ner.</p>
    <p>Si­mon & Schus­ter pub­lishes 2,500 books a year, but a grow­ing pro­por­tion of pub­lish­ers’ sales comes from what they al­ready own, rather than the de­but au­thors to whom they pay ad­vances in the hope of a best­seller.</p>
    <p>Sales of print back­list books rose to 63 per cent of a to­tal £1.7 bil­lion in the UK con­sumer mar­ket last year, ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish mag­a­zine The Book­seller, with £611 mil­lion of that from books pub­lished be­fore 2017. A third of sales of books by Lee Child, author of the Jack Reacher se­ries of thrillers, were “deep back­list” – equiv­a­lent to Swift’s mas­ters.</p>
    <p>WHAT LASTS</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery ti­tle can last: Celebrity mem­oirs do well on best­seller lists, but fade away.</p>
    <p>Books for chil­dren have the great­est stay­ing power, with J.K. Rowl­ing’s Harry Pot­ter se­ries the out­stand­ing ex­am­ple. The Tiger Who Came To Tea by the late Ju­dith Kerr, first pub­lished in 1968, sold 115,000 copies last year.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy also boosts the back­list. Book­shops can only stock a frac­tion of avail­able works, and pub­lish­ers used to let many ti­tles go out of print, mak­ing it hard to buy them. But they can now sit in e-book stores in­def­i­nitely, or be or­dered on­line with lit­tle ef­fort.</p>
    <p>As with mu­sic, when pub­lish­ers elim­i­nate the mar­ket­ing costs and risks of launch­ing new writ­ers, and sim­ply sell their es­tab­lished ones, it is more prof­itable – sales mar­gins on back­lists can be twice as high.</p>
    <p>Si­mon & Schus­ter has 1,400 em­ploy­ees, in­clud­ing many edi­tors, but would be worth far less with­out its ac­cu­mu­lated his­tory.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion that some in­vestors are start­ing to pose is why la­bels and book pub­lish­ers per­sist in pour­ing money into un­knowns when their cat­a­logues are more re­ward­ing?</p>
    <p>This sounds ab­surd to any­one who has been brought up in these busi­nesses – who will find the fu­ture Fitzger­alds and Swifts if they do not look? – but it will get louder.</p>
    <p>If it ceases to be worth hunt­ing for tal­ent, the way the hit ma­chine for mu­sic and books has al­ways op­er­ated will not en­dure much longer.</p>
    <p>New­com­ers will have to build their brands them­selves on so­cial me­dia rather than be­ing snapped up early by an im­print or mu­sic la­bel. It may be more prof­itable for in­vestors and su­per­stars, but it will not work for ev­ery­one.</p>
