    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s de­ci­sion to query op­po­si­tion can­di­dates about ties with foreign gov­ern­ments sug­gests that the au­thor­i­ties could be pre­par­ing to use the new na­tional se­cu­rity law to dis­qual­ify pro-democ­racy ad­vo­cates ahead of a key vote in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>At l east seven po­ten­tial prodemoc­racy can­di­dates for Hong Kong’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco) elec­tion have re­ceived ques­tion­naires from the govern­ment, ask­ing them to show they have not vi­o­lated the city’s mini-Con­sti­tu­tion, known as the Ba­sic Law, or the re­cently im­posed se­cu­rity mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The move fu­elled con­cerns within the pro-democ­racy move­ment that Hong Kong of­fi­cials might use pro­vi­sions of the se­cu­rity law – which bars sub­ver­sion, se­ces­sion, ter­ror­ism and foreign col­lu­sion – to ques­tion, un­der­mine or dis­qual­ify op­po­si­tion can­di­dates who have pre­vi­ously crit­i­cised the lo­cal ad­min­is­tra­tion and the govern­ment in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion, set for Sept 6, comes af­ter un­prece­dented antigov­ern­ment protests last year.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows lo­cal district coun­cil polls last Novem­ber, in which the op­po­si­tion won 85 per cent of the seats, mo­men­tum it hopes to ride to a ma­jor­ity in the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>If Hong Kong were to use the con­tro­ver­sial na­tional se­cu­rity law to dis­qual­ify can­di­dates, it would likely prompt fierce crit­i­cism from the United States, which has al­ready blasted China for im­pos­ing the leg­is­la­tion – and moved to end the spe­cial trad­ing priv­i­leges that help dis­tin­guish Hong Kong from the main­land – amid broader ten­sions with China.</p>
    <p>Mr Ivan Choy, a se­nior pol­i­tics lec­turer at The Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong, said: “These let­ters are pav­ing the way to dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion, but some­times there’s still some room to ma­noeu­vre.”</p>
    <p>At least 12 op­po­si­tion fig­ures have re­ceived let­ters of in­quiry from their re­spec­tive elec­toral of­fi­cers, ac­cord­ing to the Hong Kong Eco­nomic Jour­nal and Ca­ble TV.</p>
    <p>They in­clude prom­i­nent ac­tivist Joshua Wong; Mr Alvin Ye­ung and Mr Cheng Tat Hung of the Civic Party; and Mr Ken­neth Le­ung, who plans to rep­re­sent the ac­coun­tancy sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Ye­ung was asked to ex­plain his re­cent visit to the US – where he met Amer­i­can of­fi­cials and called for sanc­tions against cer­tain Hong Kong of­fi­cials – and if he will con­tinue lob­by­ing foreign gov­ern­ments, ac­cord­ing to the let­ter seen by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>It cited Mr Ye­ung’s so­cial me­dia posts and me­dia in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten re­ply, Mr Ye­ung said he found it “hard to ac­cept the sub­jec­tive in­ter­pre­ta­tion and as­sump­tions” be­hind some of the ques­tions, and de­nied any­thing he did con­tra­vened the Ba­sic Law.</p>
    <p>He also said the ac­tiv­i­ties re­ferred to in the let­ter oc­curred be­fore the pro­mul­ga­tion of the na­tional se­cu­rity law on June 30, that he was sim­ply ad­vo­cat­ing for Hong Kong to abide by its con­sti­tu­tional obli­ga­tions un­der the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” prin­ci­ple, and that the let­ter veered into ques­tions of pol­i­tics that were be­yond the purview of an elec­toral re­turn­ing of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Sun­day even­ing, the Hong Kong govern­ment said “the va­lid­ity of a can­di­date’s nom­i­na­tion is solely de­ter­mined by the Re­turn­ing Of­fi­cer ac­cord­ing to the le­gal re­quire­ments and rel­e­vant pro­ce­dures”.</p>
    <p>In a se­ries of Twit­ter posts, Wong – the sub­ject of a Net­flix doc­u­men­tary – blasted the govern­ment for seek­ing to ban op­po­si­tion can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, un­der the new #na­tion­alse­cu­rity­law, po­lit­i­cal screen­ing cov­ers can­di­dates’ so­cial me­dia ac­counts, me­dia in­ter­views and elec­tion fly­ers. Even an op-ed piece could be framed as ‘col­lud­ing with foreign forces’ and used as ex­cuses for po­lit­i­cal purges,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“When #Bei­jing is pav­ing ways for a large-scale elec­tion ban of pro-democ­racy run­ners, the forth­com­ing #LegCo poll in Sept will not be the elec­tion in or­di­nary sense.</p>
    <p>“It car­ries grave im­pli­ca­tions, es­pe­cially when leg­is­la­ture is the last crum­bling pil­lar of the city’s au­ton­omy.”</p>
    <p>Wong, who had been ar­rested and was granted bail last year, led a pro-democ­racy group called De­mo­sisto that was dis­solved hours af­ter Bei­jing passed the na­tional se­cu­rity law on June 30.</p>
    <p>Pro-democ­racy par­ties this month held a two-day pri­mary that drew more than 600,000 vot­ers in an ef­fort to nar­row a surge of can­di­dates ahead of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s govern­ment and China’s top agency in the city said the process could vi­o­late the new se­cu­rity mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The un­of­fi­cial vot­ing process was de­signed to over­come frac­tures in the op­po­si­tion move­ment be­tween tra­di­tional democrats and more rad­i­cal so-called “lo­cal­ists”, and present an or­gan­ised slate of can­di­dates that could ben­e­fit from the mo­men­tum gen­er­ated by last year’s protests to oust proestab­lish­ment ri­vals.</p>
