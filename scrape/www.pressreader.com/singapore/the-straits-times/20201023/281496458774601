    <p>“South Korea also must seek to fully part­ner with Asean as the Fourth In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion gath­ers mo­men­tum. The coun­try has led the Bloomberg In­no­va­tion In­dex in re­cent years and has much to of­fer the re­gion as it copes with change. The new land­scape of au­to­ma­tion and ad­di­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing of­fers Korean com­pa­nies op­por­tu­ni­ties to look be­yond tra­di­tional in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tions based on mar­ket size and wage-com­pet­i­tive­ness to a new cli­mate where ef­fi­cient lo­gis­tics and ex­per­tise in high-tech man­u­fac­tur­ing will be key.” – Speak­ing of Asia, June 2017.</p>
    <p>Since this thought was of­fered in these col­umns more than three years ago, I have pushed it at sev­eral fo­rums in South Korea, in­clud­ing the Jeju Fo­rum and World Knowl­edge Fo­rum.</p>
    <p>So, last week, when Hyundai Mo­tor for­mally be­gan work on a fac­tory to build elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs) in Sin­ga­pore, re­turn­ing the is­land to the sta­tus of car man­u­fac­turer that it shed four decades ago, a mea­sure of self-sat­is­fac­tion was un­avoid­able. In­deed, any­one who keeps up with trends in au­to­ma­tion, robo­ti­sa­tion – and geopol­i­tics – could have sug­gested the same.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, for Sin­ga­pore and its tiny home mar­ket, this is a rather sig­nif­i­cant mo­ment that means much more than one more in­vest­ment or man­u­fac­tur­ing plant. It is an en­dorse­ment of a lot that this is­land stands for: adapt­abil­ity, open­ness, will­ing­ness to em­brace tech­nol­ogy, re­spect for in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty... even an in­clu­sive for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>So, too, for South Korea’s evo­lu­tion as an in­dus­trial power.</p>
    <p>Nearly three decades ago, when Mr Lee Kuan Yew stopped in Seoul on his way to the United States, South Korea was at an in­flex­ion point and he made time to visit two chae­bols of roughly com­pa­ra­ble size. One was Sam­sung, and the other, an engi­neer­ing and auto con­glom­er­ate.</p>
    <p>At Sam­sung, he heard about plans to in­ter­na­tion­alise, com­pete and do bet­ter than Ja­pan, the dom­i­nant Asian in­dus­trial power of the time. At the other place, they were quite can­did with the Sin­ga­pore leader: They would wait for Ja­pan to do the heavy lift­ing on re­search and de­vel­op­ment, then do some­thing cheaper along the same lines.</p>
    <p>Today, Sam­sung is a global pow­er­house in con­sumer elec­tron­ics and high-end wafers. In­deed, in Viet­nam alone, a quar­ter of the na­tion’s na­tional ex­ports by value comes from Sam­sung prod­ucts made there. The other chae­bol, mean­while, is rel­a­tively un­her­alded.</p>
    <p>Like Sam­sung, Hyundai too has moved sig­nif­i­cantly up the scale in tech­nol­ogy and out­look, and per­cep­tions about its prod­ucts have also moved up. No valet these days will hes­i­tate to park a Gran­deur or Ge­n­e­sis and go look­ing in­stead for a Euro­pean mar­que to park.</p>
    <p>AU­TO­MA­TION</p>
    <p>It is now 68 years since Wil­liam Pease pub­lished his ground-break­ing ar­ti­cle in Sci­en­tific Amer­i­can on so-called feed­back con­trol, the self-pro­claimed first ac­count of a milling ma­chine that con­verts in­for­ma­tion on punched tape into the con­tours of a fin­ished part.</p>
    <p>Since that in­sight on au­to­ma­tion was of­fered by the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy sci­en­tist, things have in­deed moved a long way. But in the decade past, things have moved at un­prece­dented speed.</p>
    <p>Au­to­ma­tion and robo­ti­sa­tion have changed the con­cept of in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion in unimag­in­able ways: Wit­ness the silent, dark fac­to­ries in Shen­zhen, China, “pop­u­lated” by ro­bots that have never been busier.</p>
    <p>Then came ad­di­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing, or 3D print­ing, as it is called. Dr Klaus Sch­wab, the</p>
    <p>Swiss guru who helms the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum, gave it all a name, the Fourth In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Just when you feel you need to catch your breath, around the bend are even more ex­cit­ing things that go be­yond the Fourth In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion. For in­stance, 5G telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­bin­ing with ad­vanced sen­sors that make pos­si­ble real-time feed­back on how key parts of ma­chines are per­form­ing, en­abling pre­dic­tive main­te­nance – a huge cost saver.</p>
    <p>If man­u­fac­tur­ing is chang­ing apace, the mar­ket is shift­ing swiftly as well. Mil­len­ni­als and Gen Z’s Zoomers are no longer as fas­ci­nated with speed, size and sound as they are with so­cially re­spon­si­ble brands, even as they are com­fort­able with tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>De­clut­ter­ing and min­i­mal­ism are the mantras of the day. On top of all this, cus­tomi­sa­tion is key be­cause it helps con­sumers build an iden­tity around them­selves.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies also find their profit mar­gins in­crease if they can move from B2B – busi­ness to busi­ness – mod­els to a B2C, or busi­ness to con­sumer, one that cuts out mid­dle par­ties such as agents and deal­ers and re­duces time to mar­ket.</p>
    <p>To Hyundai’s credit, it has spot­ted the trends and is mov­ing to meet them. And EVs tick boxes in all as­pects, from so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity to fewer me­chan­i­cal parts and in­creased elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>As for cus­tomi­sa­tion, my col­league Christo­pher Tan re­ports that cus­tomers can not only buy and cus­tomise their Sin­ga­pore-made EV cars over a cell­phone, they can even watch the cars be­ing put to­gether.</p>
    <p>To be sure, trends and com­pany plans do change. While no one puts down a $400 mil­lion plant with just a few years of op­er­at­ing life in mind, Sin­ga­pore needs to be pre­pared for the ebbs and flows of tech­nol­ogy, and new con­cepts in mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>In the late 1990s, Sony pro­duced then top-of-the-line Wega tele­vi­sion sets and Trini­tron tubes on the is­land. But once the patents ran out and other com­pa­nies started mak­ing sim­i­lar prod­ucts, Sony stopped pro­duc­ing those tubes here.</p>
    <p>Like a ham­ster on a wheel, the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board’s job is never done.</p>
    <p>In more ways than one, there­fore, EVs are mov­ing with the cur­rent, so to speak. Just this month, South Korea’s off­shore prov­ince of Jeju an­nounced plans to ban the reg­is­tra­tion of all in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gine ve­hi­cles in the south­ern re­sort is­land by 2030.</p>
    <p>Jeju Provin­cial Coun­cil’s New Deal Plan in­cludes di­rec­tives for the dis­tri­bu­tion of eco-friendly cars at an in­vest­ment of 6.1 tril­lion won (S$7.29 bil­lion) by 2025 – when the first Sin­ga­pore-made EVs should be in pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Aside from nearby mar­kets such as Malaysia and In­done­sia, oth­ers within range of Sin­ga­pore also have plans to go elec­tric. For in­stance, In­dia, a mar­ket of 250 mil­lion ve­hi­cles, aims to do this by 2030.</p>
    <p>Un­til the rest of South Korea fol­lows Jeju, it is not in­con­ceiv­able that Sin­ga­pore-made EVs could be sold on that is­land as well.</p>
    <p>For sure, other na­tions will catch up even­tu­ally and the big­ger mar­kets will de­mand that the cars be pro­duced at home. In­deed, the Sin­ga­pore fac­tory could act as a pi­lot plant for scal­ing else­where or go the way of Trini­tron tubes.</p>
    <p>GEOPOL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>What about geopol­i­tics, and the con­comi­tant geoe­co­nomics? As a treaty ally of the US and in some ways a front-line state – Amer­i­can Thaad mis­sile de­fence sys­tems re­main in place in South Korea even after puni­tive Chi­nese mea­sures against Seoul – a mea­sure of geopo­lit­i­cal cal­cu­la­tions, even if un­men­tioned, surely in­forms the Hyundai move.</p>
    <p>Re­cent de­ci­sions by ByteDance – par­ent com­pany of TikTok – and Alibaba and Ten­cent to make big in­vest­ments in Sin­ga­pore have grabbed head­lines be­cause they un­der­score Sin­ga­pore’s ma­tur­ing from a con­ve­nient en­tre­pot dom­i­nated by Western multi­na­tion­als to a true con­flu­ence of cul­tures, in­vest­ment and tal­ent in an in­creas­ingly po­larised world.</p>
    <p>While TikTok’s and Ten­cent’s moves grabbed public no­tice, an equally sig­nif­i­cant and less no­ticed one by a key Chi­nese com­pany was En­vi­sion Dig­i­tal’s de­ci­sion to base its global head­quar­ters in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Aside from its world-lead­ing AIoT (ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence-In­ter­net of Things) op­er­at­ing sys­tem that now con­nects 63 mil­lion de­vices, ac­cord­ing to the com­pany web­site, En­vi­sion is a ma­jor force in re­new­able en­ergy, con­trol­ling 180GW of en­ergy as­sets glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Re­search by The MPI Group says 31 per cent of pro­duc­tion pro­cesses now in­cor­po­rate smart de­vices and em­bed­ded in­tel­li­gence. Ad­di­tion­ally, more than a third of man­u­fac­tur­ers have plans to in­cor­po­rate IoT tech­nol­ogy into their pro­cesses, while al­most an equal pro­por­tion plan to em­bed IoT tech­nol­ogy into their prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>In many ways, En­vi­sion is truly build­ing a path­way to the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Thread­ing the var­i­ous nee­dles, all of them sharp, this com­plex sit­u­a­tion calls for enor­mous dex­ter­ity on mul­ti­ple fronts, do­mes­tic and ex­ter­nal.</p>
    <p>A re­cent S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies pa­per by ex­ec­u­tive co­or­di­na­tor Shashi Jayaku­mar and re­search fel­low Manoj Har­jani dis­cussed the emerg­ing techno-na­tion­al­ism ac­com­pa­ny­ing the deep­en­ing ri­valry be­tween the US and China, one marked by ini­tia­tives such as the US’ Clean Net­work ini­tia­tive and China’s Un­re­li­able En­ti­ties list.</p>
    <p>The writ­ers warn of sus­tained fu­ture Amer­i­can scru­tiny of al­lies and part­ners that could ex­tend to AI and cloud com­put­ing.</p>
    <p>So far, Sin­ga­pore seems to have man­aged rea­son­ably well.</p>
    <p>At Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s (NTU) 200ha Jurong cam­pus, for in­stance, not far from where Hyundai has found its Jurong In­dus­trial Com­plex home, three very dif­fer­ent cor­po­rate en­ti­ties are in­volved with the univer­sity sci­en­tists and stu­dents in do­ing some fas­ci­nat­ing col­lab­o­ra­tive work – Amer­ica’s HP in the dig­i­tal space, China’s Alibaba in AI, and Europe’s Rolls-Royce in jet en­gines.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, there does not ap­pear to be a lot of in­ter­ac­tion or cross-col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the lab­o­ra­to­ries. But what if, some day, NTU is able to fa­cil­i­tate a con­ver­sa­tion be­tween them? And if, across town, the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change man­aged to get a few lead­ing tech­nol­ogy stocks from the US, Europe and China to get their stocks listed in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>Suc­cesses in ar­eas such as these would place Sin­ga­pore in a techno-po­lit­i­cal-eco­nomic sweet spot. Put that all to­gether and it would not be a bad place to be in.</p>
