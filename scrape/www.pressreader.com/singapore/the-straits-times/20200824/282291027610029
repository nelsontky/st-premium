    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard is widely con­sid­ered to be the gal­vanis­ing force be­hind the Toronto Rap­tors’ maiden cham­pi­onship ti­tle.</p>
    <p>But to those in the fran­chise, Nick Nurse played just as im­por­tant a role as the for­ward, who left for the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers last sum­mer. The Rap­tors coach was on Satur­day recog­nised for his suc­cess af­ter be­ing named the Coach of the Year for the 2019-20 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Two other Toronto coaches have won the ac­co­lade be­fore – Dwane Casey (2018) and Sam Mitchell (2007) – but nei­ther of them led the team to the promised land.</p>
    <p>Nurse, who took over from Casey in 2018 for what was his first job as an NBA head coach, has also proven their his­toric year was no fluke.</p>
    <p>The cham­pi­ons had the league’s sec­ond-best record dur­ing the reg­u­lar sea­son – 53-19 – and their 73.6 per cent win rate was a fran­chise record.</p>
    <p>They are also on the verge of sweep­ing the Brook­lyn Nets with a 3-0 lead in their open­ing-round</p>
    <p>East­ern Con­fer­ence play-off se­ries in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>The 53-year-old Nurse, who has an over­all 111-43 record with the team, high­lighted how his play­ers had ma­tured men­tally from “chok­ers” to gen­uine con­tenders in his two years at the helm.</p>
    <p>He added: “There’s a player de­vel­op­ment seg­ment, there’s a way we play de­fence, there’s a way we share the ball, there’s com­pet­i­tive­ness, there’s a never-give-up at­ti­tude, there’s all kinds of big-shot men­tal­ity, there’s lots of things that have emerged from this team.</p>
    <p>“That the big­gest one is the way we try to go out and play hard and try hard de­fen­sively and how we try to fig­ure things out each, al­most each and every pos­ses­sion, on each and every night.”</p>
