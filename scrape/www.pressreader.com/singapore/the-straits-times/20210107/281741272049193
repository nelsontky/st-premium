    <p>Malaysia’s health chief has called for tar­geted lock­downs in parts of the coun­try as daily coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions hit a new high of 2,593 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Health direc­tor-gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah said the coun­try’s health sys­tem is at a “break­ing point”, as the num­ber of ac­tive cases filled hos­pi­tal beds to near full ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>“Our worry is the daily rise in cases. The CMCO (con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der) im­ple­mented on Oct 14 pre­vented cases from hit­ting 4,000. We man­aged to avoid that, but with the 1.1 R0 (re­pro­duc­tive rate), we still couldn’t bring the cases down,” Tan Sri Noor Hisham said dur­ing his daily brief­ing yes­ter­day, re­fer­ring to the par­tial shut­down that banned in­ter­state travel and so­cial gath­er­ings and shut schools .</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Malaysia is pre­par­ing to im­pose its most strin­gent shut­down – the move­ment con­trol or­der – in Kuala Lumpur, Se­lan­gor, Sabah, Jo­hor, Pe­nang and Me­laka. This would mean peo­ple are re­quired to stay home ex­cept for es­sen­tial ac­tiv­i­ties like buy­ing food or get­ting med­i­cal at­ten­tion, while schools, restau­rants and work­places will be shut.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor con­tin­ued to record the most in­fec­tions yes­ter­day with 965 new cases, fol­lowed by Jo­hor, which re­ported 571 cases. Sabah had 405 cases, while the cap­i­tal Kuala Lumpur re­ported 256. To­tal ac­tive cases also con­tin­ued to climb, reach­ing 24,347 cases or nearly 85 per cent of the coun­try’s 28,674 hos­pi­tal beds set aside for coro­n­avirus pa­tients. The coun­try’s cu­mu­la­tive tally now stands at 125,438 cases.</p>
    <p>Dr Noor Hisham said cases are ex­pected to con­tinue spik­ing even fur­ther in the com­ing weeks. Malaysia has con­sis­tently re­ported four-digit daily in­fec­tions since the third wave of in­fec­tions that started in Septem­ber last year fol­low­ing the Sabah state leg­isla­tive elec­tions. The pre­vi­ous peak of new daily in­fec­tions was 2,525, re­ported less than a week ago.</p>
    <p>Un­der this third wave, Malaysia had ini­tially im­posed a par­tial lock­down cov­er­ing one-third of its pop­u­la­tion from mid-Oc­to­ber un­til last month. How­ever, the gov­ern­ment lifted travel re­stric­tions on Dec 7 due to con­cerns about its im­pact on the econ­omy, al­low­ing in­ter­state travel in time for the Christ­mas and New Year cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has so far recorded 513 deaths from the coro­n­avirus, with four deaths added yes­ter­day.</p>
