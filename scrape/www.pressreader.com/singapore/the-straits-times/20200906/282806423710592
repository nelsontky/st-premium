    <p>At a time when many restau­ra­teurs are wor­ry­ing about the poor eco­nomic cli­mate, a new­comer opened not just one, but two out­lets in less than two weeks.</p>
    <p>The Real Per­anakan’s first out­let opened in late July in Kim Yam Road, tak­ing up a counter inside a cafe called Kura. They are lo­cated in Crane Club, a mem­bers-only life­style and co-work­ing space, but the eater­ies are open to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Just a stone’s throw away from bustling Robert­son Quay, the restau­rant is off the main road, hid­den among some low-rise build­ings sur­round­ing a large open-air carpark.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond out­let is big­ger and more vis­i­ble in Hill­crest Road at the end of the Green­wood Av­enue row of eater­ies. This is a full-fledged restau­rant with a spa­cious kitchen be­hind glass win­dows.</p>
    <p>Its menu is a lot more ex­ten­sive with more than 30 savoury dishes, com­pared with only 13 at Kim Yam Road. But the lat­ter has a cooler vibe and am­ple park­ing space.</p>
    <p>And sur­pris­ingly for a small out­let with hardly any kitchen space, the cook­ing at Kim Yam Road is a bit bet­ter for the same dishes that I tasted. Prices for a few items are cheaper too.</p>
