    <p>TURIN (Italy) Napoli failed to turn up for their Serie A clash at Ju­ven­tus in Turin on Sun­day af­ter a coro­n­avirus row threw Ital­ian foot­ball into chaos.</p>
    <p>The match was aban­doned 45 minutes af­ter its sched­uled start time af­ter Napoli did not travel to the Al­lianz Sta­dium, and Gen­naro Gat­tuso’s side now risk for­feit­ing the game 3-0.</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus’ play­ers were present for the third game of the sea­son, along with ref­er­ees and a hand­ful of sup­port­ers un­der the rain. But not the vis­i­tors, who re­mained in iso­la­tion at home on the in­struc­tions of the re­gional health au­thor­i­ties of the Cam­pa­nia re­gion, which hosts the city of Naples, af­ter mid­field­ers Eljif El­mas and Piotr Zielin­ski both tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 dur­ing the week.</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus pres­i­dent An­drea Agnelli told Sky Sport Italia: “(Napoli pres­i­dent Aure­lio) de Lau­ren­tiis asked me to post­pone the match, I replied that there are reg­u­la­tions to be re­spected. A 3-0 win? I al­ways pre­fer to win on the field.”</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus had con­firmed they would “take to the field” as sched­uled de­spite two pos­i­tive tests among their staff this week, with coach An­drea Pirlo and the squad ar­riv­ing an hour be­fore kick-off.</p>
    <p>Serie A in­sisted that all the health pro­to­cols were in place for the match to safely go ahead “even in the event of pos­i­tive tests”. It added that these mea­sures are “ap­pli­ca­ble to the sit­u­a­tion of Napoli, who have two pos­i­tive play­ers for Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>Napoli are the first team in Europe’s five ma­jor leagues not to take to the pitch in a sched­uled game due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The club moved to deny re­ports coach Gat­tuso had tested pos­i­tive. An­other round of swabs were set to be car­ried out yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Zielin­ski and Elma’s pos­i­tive tests came af­ter last week­end’s 6-0 thump­ing of Genoa, who have since recorded 22 pos­i­tive cases that in­cludes 17 play­ers.</p>
    <p>Serie A pointed out that other matches had gone ahead de­spite pos­i­tive cases such as the game be­tween Torino and Ata­lanta, AC Mi­lan against Cro­tone and Napoli’s ham­mer­ing of Genoa.</p>
    <p>The league is ap­ply­ing Uefa rules that say a match can take place as long as a side have 13 healthy play­ers, in­clud­ing a goal­keeper. The only pos­si­ble ex­emp­tion would be a club which has an ac­tive out­break of Covid-19 with more than 10 new pos­i­tive cases in a week. In that case, the af­fected club can re­quest a post­pone­ment, but only once in the term.</p>
    <p>Serie A has in­sisted “the sys­tem of rules in force must guar­an­tee max­i­mum health pro­tec­tion for the peo­ple in­volved, equal treat­ment be­tween the clubs, as well as re­spect for prin­ci­ples of fair play”.</p>
    <p>But Napoli be­lieve the health in­struc­tions of their re­gional au­thor­i­ties su­per­sede Italy’s sports health pro­to­col.</p>
