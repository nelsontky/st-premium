    <p>The fu­ture is green but not many busi­nesses know how to get there.</p>
    <p>That is chang­ing as the risks to busi­nesses from cli­mate change grow and as in­vestors in­creas­ingly ask firms for de­tailed plans on cut­ting green­house gas emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tions and cus­tomers are also push­ing firms to be­come greener – or risk com­peti­tors steal­ing mar­ket share. This is cre­at­ing a whole new busi­ness sec­tor called car­bon ser­vices and Sin­ga­pore wants to be­come a re­gional hub.</p>
    <p>The car­bon ser­vice sec­tor cov­ers con­sul­tan­cies that can help firms fig­ure out the di­rect cli­mate risks, such as ex­treme weather im­pacts on sup­ply chains, as well as work out how pol­lut­ing com­pany op­er­a­tions are and how best to be­come leaner and greener.</p>
    <p>It also cov­ers car­bon and green en­ergy cer­tifi­cate trad­ing. Firms that can­not re­duce all their in­tended emis­sions in­ter­nally can buy car­bon off­sets or green en­ergy cer­tifi­cates from projects else­where. In short, you are pay­ing some­one else to make the emis­sion re­duc­tions on your be­half.</p>
    <p>There is a grow­ing mar­ket for trad­ing emis­sion re­duc­tions from so­lar or wind farms as well as off­sets from projects that re­move or lock away planet-warm­ing car­bon diox­ide (CO2), such as re­for­esta­tion or rain­for­est preser­va­tion in poorer na­tions. One off­set rep­re­sents a tonne of CO2.</p>
    <p>“We’re mov­ing into a car­bon­con­strained world and def­i­nitely there’s a lot of fi­nan­cial op­por­tu­ni­ties to be had,” says Mr Bill Pa­zos, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer and co­founder of Sin­ga­pore-based AirCar­bon Ex­change, a dig­i­tal plat­form that trades fully ver­i­fied car­bon off­sets.</p>
    <p>There are jobs, too. Cli­mate risk as­sess­ments, car­bon trad­ing and cre­at­ing cred­i­ble car­bon off­set projects all re­quire new skills.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in­creas­ingly need spe­cial­ists who can help them as­sess cli­mate risks and op­por­tu­ni­ties so they can re­main com­pet­i­tive, con­tinue to raise money from in­vestors and ap­peal to chang­ing con­sumer trends. Spe­cial­ist con­sul­tancy firms told The Straits Times they have seen a big uptick in de­mand for cli­mate risk and sus­tain­abil­ity ad­vi­sory work.</p>
    <p>South Pole, the global emis­sion re­duc­tion project de­vel­oper and sus­tain­abil­ity con­sul­tancy, set up a re­gional of­fice in Sin­ga­pore in 2018. “Over the past two years, we have wit­nessed a grow­ing mar­ket in Asia, and this is re­ally driven by Sin­ga­pore,” says Ms Leah Wiec­zorek, the firm’s busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­ager for South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“We help com­pa­nies to de­velop car­bon re­duc­tion strate­gies within their op­er­a­tions and sup­ply chains, which is be­com­ing a key driver to busi­ness suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“We see growth across all parts of our busi­ness in Asia, in par­tic­u­lar sus­tain­abil­ity con­sult­ing, car­bon off­sets and re­new­able en­ergy cer­tifi­cates (RECs),” she says. RECs are trad­able green en­ergy in­stru­ments, rep­re­sent­ing units of elec­tric­ity gen­er­ated from so­lar or wind projects in Sin­ga­pore or over­seas. In fact, South Pole was one of the pi­o­neer REC sell­ers on SP Group’s REC trad­ing plat­form two years ago.</p>
    <p>Ms Wiec­zorek says South Pole views Asia as the fu­ture, and es­pe­cially Sin­ga­pore as a driver for fu­ture cli­mate ac­tion in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“We see an in­creas­ing de­mand for sus­tain­abil­ity jobs in Sin­ga­pore and in­ter­est in our ser­vices,” she says, adding that South Pole is busy try­ing to ex­pand the team but has had trou­ble find­ing peo­ple with the right ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“The in­dus­try here is very young. That’s the chal­lenge for us.”</p>
    <p>That might soon change.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment re­cently called a ten­der for a study to see how the coun­try can be de­vel­oped as a car­bon ser­vice hub.</p>
    <p>Car­bon ser­vices and sus­tain­abil­ity are also the fo­cus of one of seven in­dus­try-led coali­tions con­vened un­der the Gov­ern­ment’s Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force. Build­ing a car­bon hub in Sin­ga­pore will gen­er­ate eco­nomic value and jobs and en­hance the coun­try’s role in com­mod­ity trad­ing, the task force says.</p>
    <p>Mr Marc Allen, founder of lo­cal sus­tain­abil­ity con­sul­tancy Engeco, sees huge po­ten­tial in Sin­ga­pore for car­bon ser­vices, es­pe­cially as cus­tomers, in­vestors and lenders in­crease scru­tiny of com­pa­nies’ ex­po­sure to cli­mate risks.</p>
    <p>Like South Pole, he has seen an uptick in cus­tomers look­ing to un­der­stand risk ex­po­sure and de­velop cli­mate change strate­gies. While the re­gion is be­hind Europe, Aus­tralia and the United States, where cli­mate risk as­sess­ments are more main­stream, he thinks that could change quickly.</p>
    <p>Car­bon emis­sion trad­ing has huge po­ten­tial to grow if more gov­ern­ments cre­ate manda­tory mar­kets linked to oth­ers. For now, the mar­ket re­mains frag­mented glob­ally be­tween manda­tory schemes such as the Euro­pean Union Emis­sions Trad­ing Scheme, and state­based pro­grammes and the global vol­un­tary mar­ket.</p>
    <p>One way to boost trad­ing is to make it eas­ier and pool a va­ri­ety of fully au­dited and ver­i­fied car­bon off­sets.</p>
    <p>AirCar­bon Ex­change was set up to trade car­bon just like any other com­mod­ity, help­ing boost vol­umes and price cer­tainty, says Mr Pa­zos. “We are talk­ing to com­pa­nies that have a re­tail de­mand for car­bon cred­its. They are look­ing to at­tach car­bon cred­its to their ser­vices on a re­tail ba­sis. This al­lows the ul­ti­mate user to off­set their in­di­vid­ual emis­sions.”</p>
    <p>It’s early days but he says the ex­change al­ready has 38 clients, from funds to car­bon project de­vel­op­ers. He ex­pects more clients to come on board and is look­ing to in­crease staff num­bers, too, as mar­ket in­ter­est steps up.</p>
    <p>But he is en­coun­ter­ing the same prob­lem as South Pole: find­ing peo­ple with the right back­ground.</p>
