    <p>DHAKA • Mil­lions of gar­ment work­ers could lose their jobs, with global brands de­mand­ing price cuts and de­lay­ing pay­ments to sup­pli­ers which are des­per­ate for or­ders to sur­vive the Covid-19 pan­demic, re­searchers said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sup­pli­ers have been asked to make their prices an av­er­age of 12 per cent cheaper than last year, re­search by the Cen­tre for Global Work­ers’ Rights (CGWR) at Penn State Uni­ver­sity i n the United States found, de­scrib­ing such prac­tices as “lever­ag­ing des­per­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey of 75 fac­to­ries in 15 coun­tries, sup­pli­ers said they had to wait an av­er­age of 77 days for pay­ment, com­pared to 43 days be­fore the pan­demic, rais­ing fears of fur­ther fac­tory clo­sures in an in­dus­try em­ploy­ing 60 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing a dra­matic squeeze down of price, re­duced or­ders and late pay­ment,” said Mr Mark Anner, di­rec­tor of the CGWR and au­thor of the re­port.</p>
    <p>“This wor­ries me for the well-be­ing of the sup­pli­ers and the work­ers. This will af­fect the small and medium sup­pli­ers first.”</p>
    <p>Fash­ion com­pa­nies can­celled or­ders worth bil­lions of dol­lars ear­lier this year as Covid-19 shut­tered stores world­wide, lead­ing to wage losses of up to US$5.8 bil­lion (S$7.9 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to pres­sure group Clean Clothes Cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Sup­pli­ers in coun­tries in­clud­ing Cam­bo­dia, Ethiopia, Gu­atemala, In­dia, Mex­ico, Peru and Viet­nam told CGWR that they had laid off 10 per cent of their work­ers and would have to cut another 35 per cent of their staff if or­der re­duc­tions con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ers and labour rights groups said some or­ders that were can­celled or sus­pended ear­lier in the year were be­ing re­stored, along with new or­ders, but they were fewer than the num­ber of firms jostling for con­tracts.</p>
    <p>“Buy­ers are tak­ing ad­van­tage of this,” said Mr Anner, dub­bing it an “emerg­ing sec­ond cri­sis” for sup­pli­ers af­ter the bil­lions lost in can­celled and un­paid or­ders ear­lier in the year.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lit­tle hard to see right away the grav­ity of the (sec­ond) cri­sis be­cause the new or­der vol­ume is be­ing mixed with the pay up of old or­ders that were pent up. It’s hid­ing the new cri­sis, which is the de­cline in or­der value.”</p>
    <p>More than half of the man­u­fac­tur­ers sur­veyed said they would have to close if the “sourc­ing squeeze” con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>The Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion spoke to five gar­ment man­u­fac­tur­ers in Bangladesh – which hosts more than half of the 75 sup­pli­ers in­volved in the study – which said they had been forced to cut their prices by 5 per cent to 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Iqbal Hamid Quraishi, a fac­tory owner and a di­rec­tor at the Bangladesh Gar­ment Man­u­fac­tur­ers and Ex­porters As­so­ci­a­tion, said or­der vol­umes had risen since last month but prices had fallen.</p>
    <p>“There isn’t much room to ne­go­ti­ate with brands. They tell us that if we don’t agree to their price, they can go to other sup­pli­ers,” said Mr Quraishi, adding that the in­dus­try could re­cover if the sec­ond wave of Covid-19 did not hit sales.</p>
    <p>The Geneva-based In­ter­na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Em­ploy­ers (IOE), a global busi­ness net­work, said brands and sup­pli­ers were try­ing to find so­lu­tions in “ex­tremely dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances”.</p>
    <p>“Brands... have shown re­spon­si­bil­ity by en­gag­ing in the joint Call to Ac­tion in the Gar­ment In­dus­try, which aims to sup­port man­u­fac­tur­ers to sur­vive eco­nomic dis­rup­tion... and pro­tect work­ers,” said IOE spokesman Jean Mil­li­gan.</p>
    <p>The Call to Ac­tion, which was writ­ten in April by the IOE and global unions, seeks to pro­tect work­ers’ in­comes and sup­port man­u­fac­tur­ers dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis by lob­by­ing for loans, so­cial pro­tec­tion schemes and un­em­ploy­ment pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish-based Eth­i­cal Trad­ing Ini­tia­tive, whose mem­bers in­clude H&M and Pri­mark, said the pan­demic was not an ex­cuse to row back on hu­man rights and that it was in ev­ery­one’s best in­ter­est to en­sure a sus­tain­able and ro­bust sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>There isn’t much room to ne­go­ti­ate with brands. They tell us that if we don’t agree to their price, they can go to other sup­pli­ers.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Bangladesh&#x2019;s cru&#xAD;cial tex&#xAD;tile in&#xAD;dus&#xAD;try saw a ro&#xAD;bust re&#xAD;bound from the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus cri&#xAD;sis in Au&#xAD;gust, with ex&#xAD;ports jump&#xAD;ing nearly 50 per&#xAD;cent as fac&#xAD;to&#xAD;ries swung into full gear to meet global or&#xAD;ders, of&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cials said last month. But an in&#xAD;dus&#xAD;try player said prices had fallen, with brands in a po&#xAD;si&#xAD;tion to get the best deal from the many man&#xAD;u&#xAD;fac&#xAD;tur&#xAD;ers world&#xAD;wide vy&#xAD;ing for con&#xAD;tracts.</p>
