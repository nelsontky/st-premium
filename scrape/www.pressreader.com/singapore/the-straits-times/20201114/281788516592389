    <p>• The oust­ing of four prodemoc­racy law­mak­ers from Hong Kong’s leg­is­la­ture was “the right medicine” for the city, China said, telling for­eign gov­ern­ments the is­sue was none of their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The four op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers – Civic Party’s Mr Alvin Ye­ung, Mr Kwok Ka Ki and Mr Den­nis Kwok, as well as Mr Kenneth Le­ung of the Pro­fes­sion­als Guild – were re­moved in line with a res­o­lu­tion adopted by China’s Par­lia­ment au­tho­ris­ing the ex­pul­sion of any politi­cian deemed un­pa­tri­otic or a threat to na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Last year, mil­lions of Hong Kongers took to the streets in months of protests over ebbing free­doms. Demon­stra­tions were stamped out by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and a new se­cu­rity law that made cer­tain opin­ions il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>The ex­pul­sions this week were “the right medicine that will start a new chap­ter in en­sur­ing smooth op­er­a­tion” of Hong Kong’s leg­is­la­ture, said China’s For­eign Min­istry in Hong Kong on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sion is in­tended to guar­an­tee nor­mal op­er­a­tion of gov­ern­ing bod­ies... and bet­ter en­sure Hong Kong is gov­erned by Hong Kong peo­ple with a high de­gree of au­ton­omy,” it said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil was hi­jacked by anti-China ac­tivists such that it took more than six months to elect a chair­man of the House Com­mit­tee, and Bills con­cern­ing the econ­omy and peo­ple’s liveli­hood were stalled for a long time, said a spokesman for the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain – which handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 – ac­cused Bei­jing of break­ing in­ter­na­tional treaty obli­ga­tions that guar­an­teed the fi­nan­cial hub spe­cial sta­tus and a high de­gree of au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>China pushed back at the crit­i­cism, telling a “hand­ful of for­eign politi­cians to grasp the trend of the times, keep their hands off China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs, stop med­dling with Hong Kong af­fairs in any form and avoid go­ing far­ther down the wrong path”.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry added that the le­gal ba­sis for the cen­tral gov­ern­ment’s ad­min­is­tra­tion of Hong Kong is the Con­sti­tu­tion of China and the Hong Kong Ba­sic Law. A small num­ber of for­eign politi­cians had cited the Si­noBri­tish Joint Dec­la­ra­tion but none of the ar­ti­cles in the dec­la­ra­tion give for­eign coun­tries the right to in­ter­fere in Hong Kong’s af­fairs, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The min­istry spokesman said the loy­alty of politi­cians to their coun­try is not unique to China or Hong Kong, but a recog­nised in­ter­na­tional norm com­mon to all na­tions.</p>
    <p>No coun­try would al­low peo­ple who split the na­tion, sub­vert the regime and col­lude with ex­ter­nal forces to hold pub­lic of­fice, said the spokesman. Also, no coun­try will al­low par­lia­men­tar­i­ans to be­tray their vows and vi­o­late the law with­out bear­ing le­gal con­se­quences, the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s leader is cho­sen by pro-Bei­jing com­mit­tees, but half of the leg­is­la­ture’s 70 seats are di­rectly elected, giving the city’s 7.5 mil­lion res­i­dents a rare chance to be heard at the bal­lot box. The ex­pul­sions and res­ig­na­tions will leave just two leg­is­la­tors out­side the pro-Bei­jing camp, both of them un­aligned with ei­ther bloc.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Hong Kong Law</p>
    <p>So­ci­ety said the city’s gov­ern­ment has a duty to ad­dress pub­lic con­cerns re­gard­ing the four law­mak­ers’ dis­missal, as well as ques­tions on the res­o­lu­tion that gives Hong Kong the power to un­seat the four, pub­lic broad­caster RTHK said.</p>
    <p>No coun­try would al­low peo­ple who split the na­tion, sub­vert the regime and col­lude with ex­ter­nal forces to hold pub­lic of­fice, said a spokesman for China’s For­eign Min­istry in Hong Kong. Also, no coun­try will al­low par­lia­men­tar­i­ans to be­tray their vows and vi­o­late the law with­out bear­ing le­gal con­se­quences, the spokesman added.</p>
