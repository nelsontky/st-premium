    <p>The US Congress yes­ter­day for­mally recog­nised Mr Joe Bi­den as the next pres­i­dent of the United States, with a vote that had been de­layed by a pro-Trump mob that oc­cu­pied the Capi­tol in a bid to over­turn his elec­toral vic­tory. Out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump promised an or­derly tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den was for­mally recog­nised as the next pres­i­dent of the United States yes­ter­day by a Congress de­layed but un­de­terred by the pro-Trump mob that had ear­lier oc­cu­pied the Capi­tol in a bid to over­turn his elec­toral vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The early-morn­ing vote came hours af­ter a mob of pro-Trump pro­test­ers stormed the Capi­tol build­ing, forc­ing law­mak­ers to flee to safety and sus­pend dis­cus­sions on states’ Elec­toral Col­lege votes for the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, blamed by many for in­cit­ing the mob with his re­peated false claims that the elec­tion had been stolen from him, promised an or­derly tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“Even though I to­tally dis­agree with the out­come of the elec­tion, and the facts bear me out, nev­er­the­less, there will be an or­derly tran­si­tion on Jan 20,” Mr Trump said in a state­ment on Twit­ter is­sued through an aide, af­ter his ac­count was briefly sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Congress, led by Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, cer­ti­fied Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory in an early-morn­ing vote, af­ter law­mak­ers voted down ob­jec­tions to the Elec­toral Col­lege votes cer­ti­fied by the states, raised by dozens of Repub­li­cans loyal to Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers had been ear­lier forced to sus­pend the pro­ceed­ings af­ter Trump sup­port­ers suc­cess­fully breached the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>Smash­ing win­dows to en­ter the build­ing, the sup­port­ers fought with Capi­tol po­lice once inside, bran­dish­ing Trump ban­ners and con­fed­er­acy flags, and cheer­ing from the bal­conies of the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>One woman was fa­tally shot by a po­lice of­fi­cer, and later died in hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>As tear gas was de­ployed in the Capi­tol Ro­tunda, mem­bers of Congress were told to put on the gas masks un­der their seats.</p>
    <p>For sev­eral hours, the mob wan­dered through the halls of Congress, pos­ing for self­ies in the Se­nate and House cham­ber amid scat­tered pa­pers and over­turned desks be­fore they were even­tu­ally dis­persed by po­lice.</p>
    <p>One man was pho­tographed with his feet up on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desk. Oth­ers emerged from the Capi­tol show­ing off items they had stolen from her of­fice.</p>
    <p>Po­lice later said that four peo­ple died on the Capi­tol grounds on Wed­nes­day and 52 peo­ple had been ar­rested.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and law­mak­ers con­demned the vi­o­lence. “In this hour, our democ­racy is un­der un­prece­dented as­sault, un­like any­thing we have seen in mod­ern times. An as­sault on the citadel of lib­erty, the Capi­tol it­self,” he said from Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware.</p>
    <p>OR­DERLY TRAN­SI­TION PROMISED</p>
    <p>Mr Pence, pre­sid­ing over the Se­nate as it re­sumed its de­bate, said: “To those who wreaked havoc in our Capi­tol to­day: You did not win. Vi­o­lence never wins.”.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell said: “The United States Se­nate will not be in­tim­i­dated. We will not be kept out of this cham­ber by thugs, mobs or threats.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers blamed Mr Trump for in­cit­ing the vi­o­lence. At a rally ear­lier in the day, he had urged his sup­port­ers to march on the Capi­tol to “cheer on” Congress and “show strength”, promis­ing he would be there along­side them. He was not.</p>
    <p>It was clear in the af­ter­math that Mr Trump had lost some sup­port from al­lies in Congress.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans ini­tially planned to ob­ject to the Elec­toral Col­lege votes from sev­eral swing states that Mr Bi­den won. But af­ter Congress re­con­vened, sev­eral Repub­li­can se­na­tors said they had changed their minds and, in the end, only Ari­zona and Penn­syl­va­nia were chal­lenged.</p>
    <p>In a show of dis­ap­proval, the Se­nate chose not to de­bate be­fore vot­ing 92-7 to re­ject the Penn­syl­va­nia chal­lenge, al­though the House de­bated the full two hours be­fore re­ject­ing the chal­lenge 282-138.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can se­na­tors also ef­fec­tively blocked mem­bers of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives from ob­ject­ing to re­sults from Ge­or­gia,</p>
    <p>Michi­gan and Ne­vada by re­fus­ing to join their chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Be­fore pro­ceed­ings were dis­rupted, key Repub­li­can es­tab­lish­ment fig­ures had sig­nalled their re­jec­tion of Mr Trump’s at­tempts to over­turn the elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence, who had been pub­licly pres­sured by Mr Trump to over­turn states’ votes, told Congress in a let­ter that the Con­sti­tu­tion did not give him the power to do so.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell re­buked his col­leagues as he ex­plained why he would not vote in favour of the op­tion, say­ing: “If this elec­tion were over­turned by mere al­le­ga­tions from the los­ing side, our democ­racy would en­ter a death spi­ral.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of­fi­cials re­signed in the wake of Wed­nes­day’s events, in­clud­ing Deputy Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Matt Pot­tinger, the First Lady’s chief of staff Stephanie Gr­isham, and spe­cial en­voy to North­ern Ire­land Mick Mul­vaney.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral House Democrats said they were dis­cussing draw­ing up ar­ti­cles of im­peach­ment.</p>
    <p>Me­dia out­lets re­ported that some se­nior ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials and Repub­li­can of­fi­cials were dis­cussing in­vok­ing the 25th Amend­ment, un­der which Mr Trump could be re­moved from of­fice be­fore his term ex­pires on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Even though I to­tally dis­agree with the out­come of the elec­tion, and the facts bear me out, nev­er­the­less, there will be an or­derly tran­si­tion on Jan 20. I have al­ways said we would con­tinue our fight to en­sure that only le­gal votes were counted. While this rep­re­sents the end of the great­est first term in pres­i­den­tial his­tory, it is only the be­gin­ning of our fight to Make Amer­ica Great Again!</p>
    <p>U.S. PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP, in a state­ment af­ter the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of votes for the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. He posted this on the Twit­ter ac­count of Mr Dan Scavino, White House deputy chief of staff for com­mu­ni­ca­tions and di­rec­tor of so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>A SAD DAY</p>
    <p>(I) have been up, watch­ing shock­ing scenes in the US Congress where pro­test­ers have en­tered the cham­ber, stopped pro­ceed­ings and forced mem­bers to flee... We hope this ends peace­fully. It is a sad day.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>SE­NIOR MIN­IS­TER TEO CHEE HEAN, in a Face­book post. He said he hoped the events in the US would come to a peace­ful end.</p>
    <p>Two po­lit­i­cal earth­quakes have hit the United States – one the storm­ing of the Capi­tol by a mob of Trump sup­port­ers, the other the Repub­li­cans’ loss of the party’s ma­jor­ity in the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Both have shaken up the coun­try. Im­ages of Trump sup­port­ers – egged on by their leader – storm­ing the Capi­tol may have shocked the world, but they came as no sur­prise to any­one closely fol­low­ing pol­i­tics in the US. The coun­try was and re­mains a tin­der­box, with a pop­u­la­tion that is deeply di­vided. Since Novem­ber, the Pres­i­dent has been con­vinc­ing his base that the elec­tion was stolen from him – de­spite the fact that his cam­paign and his al­lies ei­ther lost or had dis­missed 62 out of 63 law­suits they filed be­cause they could pro­duce no ev­i­dence of this.</p>
    <p>Mr Don­ald Trump, who came to power chan­nelling griev­ances of prin­ci­pally white work­ing-class peo­ple fear­ful of de­mo­graphic change, left be­hind by glob­al­ism and re­sent­ful of glob­alised ur­ban elites, had said ex­plic­itly for months that the only way he would lose the Nov 3 elec­tion would be if it was rigged.</p>
    <p>Thwarted in the courts, Mr Trump took his fight to con­tinue in power to what amounts to his own per­sonal po­lit­i­cal base.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s im­age around the world took a blow. Mr Carl Bildt, a for­mer prime min­is­ter of Swe­den who is now the co-chair­man of the Euro­pean Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions, said on Twit­ter: “The shin­ing city on the hill... has just been stormed by a mob.”</p>
    <p>Dr Richard Haass, pres­i­dent of the Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions, a Wash­ing­ton think-tank, tweeted: “No one in the world is likely to see, re­spect, fear, or de­pend on us in the same way again. If the post-Amer­i­can era has a start date, it is al­most cer­tainly to­day.”</p>
    <p>Yet all the red flags were there. “The groups, the or­gan­i­sa­tions, the rhetoric, the po­lit­i­cal abet­ment… were all there,” Mis­sis­sippi State Univer­sity aca­demic Vasab­jit Ban­er­jee told The Straits Times. “What was be­ing counted on was the idea of norms, that it is just not done. And the norms have frayed.”</p>
    <p>The other tremor is no less sig­nif­i­cant. Wed­nes­day’s vic­tory in the Ge­or­gia Se­nate run-offs, of Democrats Jon Os­soff and Raphael Warnock – the lat­ter the first African Amer­i­can sen­a­tor to be elected from the south­ern state – means the Se­nate is now split 50-50 between Repub­li­cans and Democrats. In­com­ing vice-pres­i­dent Ka­mala Harris will have a tie-break­ing vote.</p>
    <p>This will dis­lodge Repub­li­can Mitch McCon­nell, who as ma­jor­ity leader since 2015 has been one of the most pow­er­ful peo­ple in Wash­ing­ton and very ef­fec­tive at putting the brakes on a Democrat pres­i­dent – as he did in the case of for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Apart from mak­ing it eas­ier for Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den to pur­sue his and the Demo­cratic Party’s im­me­di­ate agenda, this could sig­nify fun­da­men­tal po­lit­i­cal shifts.</p>
    <p>“With the Democrats in con­trol of both Congress and the Ex­ec­u­tive Branch, it is rea­son­able to ex­pect we will see vot­ing rights leg­is­la­tion, which will doom the cur­rent-day Repub­li­can Party, de­pend­ing as it has on voter sup­pres­sion to stay in power,” Bos­ton Col­lege his­tory pro­fes­sor Heather Cox Richard­son wrote in a note on Face­book.</p>
    <p>The Ge­or­gia verdicts, and the chaos on Wed­nes­day, thus raise se­ri­ous ques­tions for Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, even be­fore the chaotic spec­ta­cle on Capi­tol Hill, Repub­li­cans like Sen­a­tor McCon­nell sent ex­plicit sig­nals that they were not go­ing to toe the Pres­i­dent’s line. Fol­low­ing the storm­ing of the Capi­tol by the Pres­i­dent’s sup­port­ers, leav­ing law­mak­ers flee­ing, some in gas masks, sev­eral in­clud­ing staunch Trump ally, Sen­a­tor Lind­sey Gra­ham, dropped op­po­si­tion to the Elec­toral Col­lege vote.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor of Amer­i­can Stud­ies Glenn Altschuler at Cor­nell Univer­sity told The Straits Times: “When Trump is out of of­fice, as he will be soon, it will be even eas­ier for peo­ple who have not ex­actly been pro­files in courage in the Repub­li­can Party to be­gin to get greater and greater sep­a­ra­tion from Trump him­self, and from Trump­ism.</p>
    <p>“That’s not to say that the toxic</p>
    <p>“With the Democrats in con­trol of both Congress and the Ex­ec­u­tive Branch, it is rea­son­able to ex­pect we will see vot­ing rights leg­is­la­tion, which will doom the cur­rent-day Repub­li­can Party, de­pend­ing as it has on voter sup­pres­sion to stay in power,” Bos­ton Col­lege his­tory pro­fes­sor Heather Cox Richard­son wrote in a note on Face­book.</p>
    <p>po­lit­i­cal par­ti­san­ship will die… (or) that the dam­age to democ­racy can be eas­ily re­paired. But this is a day that makes it… eas­ier po­lit­i­cally to break with him. And you now have ev­i­dence in Ge­or­gia that syco­phancy to Don­ald Trump doesn’t nec­es­sar­ily get you elected.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter the two earth­quakes had kicked up dust, Con­gress­men barely had time to as­sess how their world had changed. The post-mortems will take place later.</p>
    <p>As a shocked na­tion comes to terms with the spec­ta­cle in Wash­ing­ton – the events of the day left four peo­ple dead – there was a nec­es­sary re­turn to due process on Wed­nes­day night; Congress went back to busi­ness and worked through the night to for­malise the Elec­toral Col­lege vote in the early hours of the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“The dent to Amer­i­can pres­tige, which is un­der­stand­able, is not likely to per­sist when the per­son re­spon­si­ble for it is no longer in power,” Prof Altschuler told The Straits Times. “And the per­son who suc­ceeds him is dif­fer­ent in ev­ery re­spect, in tone, in con­tent, in dig­nity. And so that kind of dent can be re­paired.”</p>
