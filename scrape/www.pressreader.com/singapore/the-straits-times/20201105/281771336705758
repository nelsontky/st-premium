    <p>LON­DON • A study of the peo­ple who died from Covid-19 has found per­sis­tent and ex­ten­sive lung dam­age in most cases, and may help doc­tors un­der­stand what is be­hind a syn­drome known as “long Covid”, in which pa­tients suf­fer on­go­ing symp­toms for months.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists leading the re­search said they also found some unique char­ac­ter­is­tics of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, which may ex­plain why it is able to in­flict such harm.</p>
    <p>“The find­ings in­di­cate that Covid-19 is not sim­ply a dis­ease caused by the death of virus-in­fected cells, but is likely the con­se­quence of these ab­nor­mal cells per­sist­ing for long pe­ri­ods in­side the lungs,” said Pro­fes­sor Mauro Gi­acca at King’s Col­lege Lon­don who co-led the work.</p>
    <p>The re­search team an­a­lysed sam­ples of tis­sue taken from the lungs, heart, liver and kid­neys of 41 pa­tients who died of Covid-19 at Italy’s Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal of Tri­este be­tween Fe­bru­ary and April this year.</p>
    <p>In a tele­phone in­ter­view, Prof Gi­acca said while his re­search team found no overt signs of vi­ral in­fec­tion or pro­longed in­flam­ma­tion in other or­gans, they dis­cov­ered “re­ally vast de­struc­tion of the ar­chi­tec­ture of the lungs”, with healthy tis­sue “al­most com­pletely sub­sti­tuted by scar tis­sue”.</p>
    <p>He added: “It could very well be en­vis­aged that one of the rea­sons why there are cases of long Covid is that there is vast de­struc­tion of lung (tis­sue).</p>
    <p>“Even if some­one re­cov­ers from Covid, the dam­age that is done could be mas­sive.”</p>
    <p>Grow­ing ev­i­dence from around the world sug­gests that a small pro­por­tion of peo­ple who have had Covid-19 and re­cov­ered from their ini­tial in­fec­tion can ex­pe­ri­ence a range of on­go­ing symp­toms, in­clud­ing fa­tigue, brain fog and short­ness of breath.</p>
    <p>The con­di­tion is of­ten called “long Covid”.</p>
    <p>Prof Gi­acca said al­most 90 per cent of the 41 pa­tients had sev­eral char­ac­ter­is­tics unique to Covid-19 com­pared to other forms of pneu­mo­nia.</p>
    <p>One was that pa­tients had ex­ten­sive blood clot­ting of the lung ar­ter­ies and veins.</p>
    <p>Another was that some lung cells were ab­nor­mally large and had many nu­clei – a re­sult of the fu­sion of dif­fer­ent cells into sin­gle large cells in a process known as syn­cy­tia.</p>
    <p>The re­search, pub­lished in journal Lancet EBioMedici­ne, also found that the virus it­self was still present in many types of cells.</p>
    <p>“The pres­ence of these in­fected cells can cause the ma­jor struc­tural changes ob­served in lungs, which can per­sist for sev­eral weeks or months and could even­tu­ally ex­plain ‘long Covid’,” Prof Gi­acca said.</p>
