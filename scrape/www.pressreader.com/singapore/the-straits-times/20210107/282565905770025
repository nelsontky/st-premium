    <p>The Watch is a se­ries based on Terry Pratch­ett’s Dis­c­world fan­tasy nov­els, a set­ting in­hab­ited by were­wolves, trolls, zom­bies and dwarves.</p>
    <p>But for ac­tor Richard Dormer, this new tele­vi­sion ver­sion of Dis­c­world is the cur­rent world – like many in the de­vel­oped world, the show’s denizens are cyn­i­cal about their gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Chaos in the fic­tional world of the show and in the real pan­demic­stricken one are both the re­sult of poor lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>“Dis­c­world is run by fools. In the story, we watch them make bad choices,” the 51-year-old ac­tor tells The Straits Times in an on­line call from his home in Belfast, North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>Dormer, who plays re­sis­tance group leader Beric Don­dar­rion in an­other fan­tasy se­ries, Game Of Thrones (2013 to 2019), plays Sam Vimes in The Watch.</p>
    <p>The Watch is available on BBC First (StarHub TV Chan­nel 502) and BBC Player.</p>
    <p>Vimes is a fre­quently drunk mem­ber of the Ankh-Mor­pork City Watch, a some­what ir­rel­e­vant po­lice force in a place where pow­er­ful guilds en­force laws drawn up to pro­mote their own self-in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>He ap­pears as a run-down man with a par­tic­u­lar lurch­ing gait and</p>
    <p>squint. Dormer says he ar­rived at that por­trayal by com­bin­ing a few film archetypes of the jaded ad­ven­turer.</p>
    <p>“I imag­ined Vimes as Humphrey Bog­art in The African Queen,” says Dormer, re­fer­ring to the 1951 clas­sic movie. “Bog­art played a gruff,</p>
    <p>griz­zled war­rior. There is also an el­e­ment of Har­ri­son Ford’s Han Solo from Star Wars and also Lee Marvin, those old Hol­ly­wood ac­tors.”</p>
    <p>Vimes’ di­shev­elled, dis­so­lute ap­pear­ance comes from hard liv­ing.</p>
    <p>Dormer says: “The man has spent 20 years of his life roam­ing the streets drunk, wear­ing the same boots with holes in the soles. His knees are gone and his lungs don’t work well be­cause of the cigars.</p>
    <p>“He feels use­less as the head of po­lice in a city where crime is le­gal.</p>
    <p>“Ba­si­cally, he is bur­dened by life. It’s al­most like he’s car­ry­ing Dis­c­world on his shoul­ders.”</p>
    <p>The adap­ta­tion re­vises as­pects of the eight Terry Pratch­ett nov­els fea­tur­ing the City Watch, re­leased be­tween 1989 and 2011.</p>
    <p>The de­vi­a­tions from the books, such as the use of a punk and glam rock aes­thetic in­stead of a me­di­ae­val one, have drawn the ire of Pratch­ett devo­tees, many of whom have roasted the se­ries on­line.</p>
    <p>The books were writ­ten, in some cases, three decades ago, ex­plains Dormer.</p>
    <p>If the pro­duc­tion had stuck to the “tin hats, ar­mour and chain mail” of the source ma­te­rial, the show could re­sem­ble Time Ban­dits (1981) and there­fore look dated, he says.</p>
    <p>“Pratch­ett cre­ated a crazy, bril­liant world, and we have one foot in that world and an­other in a Blade Run­ner-es­que fu­ture,” he says.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion team stayed true to its artis­tic vi­sion and did not let wor­ries about how the show would be re­ceived by Pratch­ett fans get to them, he says.</p>
    <p>“We jumped into the deep end of the pool and had fun. You can’t please ev­ery­body all the time. We did what we had com­mit­ted to do and hav­ing seen it, I can’t imag­ine it any other way.”</p>
    <p>The Watch is available on</p>
    <p>BBC First (StarHub TV Chan­nel 502) and BBC Player.</p>
