    <p>While the au­to­mo­tive world has down­sized en­gines with some re­mark­able re­sults, BMW-owned Mini seems to be lag­ging be­hind.</p>
    <p>Its small­est engine in the Mini range now is a 1.5-litre three-cylin­der found in the Mini One range. Its out­put is marginally more than what a pre­vi­ous 1.2-litre pro­duced, so one won­ders why Mini does not use a tuned-up 1.2-litre in­stead.</p>
    <p>In a world where 1.2- or even 1-litre en­gines can be found in far big­ger cars, Mini could do like­wise. It would gel quite well with the brand name and her­itage. (The orig­i­nal Mini had an engine as small as 848cc.)</p>
    <p>Who knows, with forced in­duc­tion and high com­pres­sion, a high-revving 1-litre might be en­ter­tain­ing in a Mini. That day might come, even with the march of elec­tri­fi­ca­tion gain­ing mo­men­tum by the minute.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, here is the Mini One Club­man, pow­ered by the afore­said 1.5-litre three-cylin­der. Go­ing by dis­place­ment, this tur­bocharged unit has a mod­est out­put: 102hp and 190Nm.</p>
    <p>The Mini One Club­man is cur­rently the big­gest Mini here to have this miserly engine. The pre­vi­ous model tested here with the same engine was the Mini One 5Dr.</p>
    <p>The Club­man is con­sid­er­ably big­ger. Mea­sur­ing 4,253mm bumper to bumper, it is 271mm longer than the 5Dr. Its wheel­base of 2,670mm is 103mm longer than the 5Dr’s. And its boot, which is ac­ces­si­ble via two small side-hinged rear doors, has a stowage of 360 litres – 82 litres more than that of the 5Dr.</p>
    <p>This big­ger Mini is not as nippy as the 5Dr, which it­self is no fire­cracker. It clocks an 11.6-sec­ond cen­tury sprint and a top speed of 185kmh – ter­ri­tory usu­ally as­so­ci­ated with non-turbo Ja­panese cars.</p>
    <p>Does this mean the Mini One Club­man is a dud? Far from it. The car still de­liv­ers a sem­blance of drive­abil­ity. Give the ac­cel­er­a­tor pedal a hard shove and the engine will re­spond with buck­ets of revs.</p>
    <p>To its credit, the engine can be ex­tended to near its lim­its and still feel un­burstable. Keep the pedal de­pressed and the Mini will high­tail to point B with more pace than a city car can han­dle.</p>
    <p>It is fairly ef­fi­cient too. For this test-drive, it av­er­ages 8.6 litres/100km – not quite the 6 litres de­clared, but still ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>The Mini has a won­der­ful chas­sis which keeps it mag­ne­tised to the tar­mac. It cor­ners with flour­ish, but for tighter turns, its ex­tra length comes to the fore.</p>
    <p>The car’s steer­ing is also a bit un­nat­u­ral, with a heft which con­veys sporti­ness, but a strange starch­i­ness which in­ter­rupts its lin­ear­ity. At times, it also re­quires mid-cor­ner, which mars an other­wise rather pos­i­tive driv­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. It is, af­ter all, still a nim­ble and grounded com­pact.</p>
    <p>The Mini ful­fils its role as a life­style car ex­cel­lently, with plenty of bling in­side and out. Be­ing a Club­man, it of­fers more ver­sa­til­ity – its stowage can be ex­panded to 1,250 litres if you fold the rear seats down. Its side­hinged rear doors are more stylis­tic than func­tional, but the au­to­matic open­ing is a nice touch.</p>
    <p>In all, the Club­man is a pleas­ant enough ride which could do with more verve and vi­tal­ity – per­haps from a dif­fer­ent engine.</p>
