    <p>Two Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) of­fi­cers were each sen­tenced to 10 weeks’ jail yes­ter­day over their in­volve­ment in a 2018 rag­ging in­ci­dent that led to the death of a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man (NSF).</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a trial, Nazhan Mo­hamed Nazi, 42, was found guilty last month of act­ing neg­li­gently by fail­ing to pre­vent his sub­or­di­nates from car­ry­ing out the rag­ging ac­tiv­ity on the night of May 13, 2018.</p>
    <p>Nazhan was the deputy com­man­der of Tuas View Fire Sta­tion at the time. His col­league, Ken­neth Chong Chee Boon, 40, who was the com­man­der, had pleaded guilty to a sim­i­lar of­fence in July.</p>
    <p>The pair were the last two to be dealt with in court after the in­ci­dent. Be­fore sen­tenc­ing them yes­ter­day, Se­nior Dis­trict Judge Ong Hian Sun said that they had been “grossly neg­li­gent” and that death was the worst out­come that could hap­pen. The judge added that a strong stance must be taken to en­sure that the safety of ser­vice­men re­mains paramount.</p>
    <p>Some of the pair’s sub­or­di­nates had pres­sured the NSF, Cor­po­ral Kok Yuen Chin, 22, to en­ter a 12mdeep pump well at the fire sta­tion</p>
    <p>that evening to mark the im­pend­ing com­ple­tion of his na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>He drowned after an­other one of his col­leagues, Muham­mad Nur Fatwa Mah­mood, 34, pushed him</p>
    <p>in. Three SCDF reg­u­lars, in­clud­ing Nur Fatwa, had ear­lier been con­victed and sen­tenced over their in­volve­ment in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Nur Fatwa was sen­tenced to a year and four weeks’ jail in Oc­to­ber 2018 after he ad­mit­ted to the fa­tal push.</p>
    <p>Nazhan and Chong were orig­i­nally charged with in­ten­tion­ally aid­ing a group of SCDF ser­vice­men to cause griev­ous hurt to Cpl Kok via a rash act en­dan­ger­ing hu­man life.</p>
    <p>Those con­victed of this of­fence can be jailed for up to four years and fined up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>But after an ear­lier trial, Judge Ong re­duced their charges to the current one – that of per­form­ing a neg­li­gent act by fail­ing to pre­vent their sub­or­di­nates from car­ry­ing out the rag­ging ac­tiv­ity on May 13, 2018. Those con­victed of this of­fence can be jailed for up to three months and fined up to $1,500.</p>
    <p>Chong be­gan serv­ing his sen­tence yes­ter­day. Mean­while, Nazhan’s de­fence lawyer, Mr Singa Ret­nam, told the court his client in­tends to ap­peal against his con­vic­tion and sen­tence. His bail was then set at $15,000.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Ku­mare­san Go­hu­la­balan told the court the pros­e­cu­tion will be ap­peal­ing against the ear­lier or­der to amend the charge.</p>
