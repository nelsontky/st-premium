    <p>For the newly crowned Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) cham­pion LeBron James, liv­ing and work­ing in the same place for more than three months “played with your mind” and “played with your body”.</p>
    <p>Phoenix Suns coach Monty Wil­liams mar­velled most at a statis­tic – zero coro­n­avirus-re­lated post­pone­ments dur­ing the league’s grand sports and so­cial ex­per­i­ment.</p>
    <p>Adam Sil­ver, the com­mis­sioner of the NBA, called it a tri­umph that re­quired “ex­tra­or­di­nary sac­ri­fices by ev­ery­one in­volved”.</p>
    <p>Seven months af­ter halt­ing play as the pan­demic surged across the United States, the NBA con­cluded its sea­son in a re­stricted-ac­cess bub­ble at Walt Dis­ney World near Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>The league tested play­ers for the virus daily. It im­posed strict rules and oc­ca­sion­ally doled out penal­ties to en­sure that 113 pages of health and safety pro­to­cols were fol­lowed. Long bouts of iso­la­tion and the re­sul­tant men­tal and emo­tional strain prompted Rajon Rondo, James’ Los An­ge­les Lak­ers team­mate, to deem this “by far” the hard­est post­sea­son of his 14-year ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Yet it also worked. The bub­ble held for 96 days, and when play­ers leaguewide re­fused to play in a ges­ture of civil rights protest dur­ing the first round of the play-offs, league of­fi­cials and team own­ers pledged to do more to sup­port so­cial jus­tice causes.</p>
    <p>The restarted sea­son, which be­gan amid con­sid­er­able scep­ti­cism, ul­ti­mately de­liv­ered a tele­vised spec­ta­cle with a Hol­ly­wood end­ing, as the Lak­ers emerged with the fran­chise’s 17th NBA ti­tle. It was James’ fourth.</p>
    <p>Now thorny dis­cus­sions loom be­tween league of­fi­cials and the play­ers’ union to ad­dress an ar­ray of un­knowns about next sea­son. What is cer­tain is that the play­ers have been promised eight weeks’ no­tice be­fore they have to start anew.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver has said he doesn’t ex­pect the new sea­son to start be­fore Jan­uary. While there is a strong de­sire on both sides to see teams play in their home mar­kets, prefer­ably with a small num­ber of fans ad­mit­ted to games, it re­mains un­clear how soon it will be safe to do so.</p>
    <p>The NBA draft is set for Nov 18, and the league’s US$180 mil­lion (S$244.6 mil­lion) bub­ble al­lowed it to crown a cham­pion for the 74th year while also sat­is­fy­ing some agree­ments with tele­vi­sion part­ners. Yet there is much to re­solve.</p>
    <p>The league and the union must de­cide when to start free agency and how long they can hold out for a re­turn to home mar­kets be­fore con­ced­ing that short-term re­gional bub­bles may be nec­es­sary to play.</p>
    <p>They must also es­tab­lish a new salary cap and lux­ury tax amid the pinch of a US$1.5 bil­lion short­fall in pro­jected rev­enue from this sea­son.</p>
    <p>At least the sides head into this off sea­son with the mo­men­tum that flows from find­ing a creative so­lu­tion to stay op­er­a­tional.</p>
    <p>The NBA was the first ma­jor North Amer­i­can sports league to sus­pend op­er­a­tions in March in re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a four-month stop­page, 22 of the league’s 30 teams were sum­moned to one site for the first time in league history. No one was al­lowed to leave the campus once in­side with­out league au­tho­ri­sa­tion, and fans were barred from venues.</p>
    <p>Each day, play­ers, coaches and staff mem­bers were tested for the virus. They were also gov­erned by so­cial dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions dur­ing meal times and leisure ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There was push­back about the con­straints from the in­side – “I feel like when we got in the bub­ble, ev­ery­one was com­plain­ing about not want­ing to be here,” Mi­ami’s Bam Ade­bayo said – but play­ers also wanted to use the vis­i­bil­ity of the NBA’s come­back to sup­port their so­cial ad­vo­cacy.</p>
    <p>There were roughly 1,500 campus res­i­dents at the bub­ble’s peak, but the league man­aged to stage 172 reg­u­lar-sea­son and play-off games with­out a se­ri­ous coro­n­avirus threat.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver’s Sept 30 state­ment said that the league had reg­is­tered “no cases” of the coro­n­avirus among rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the 22 teams and NBA per­son­nel who be­gan re­port­ing to the campus on July 7.</p>
    <p>The only stop­page of was not health-re­lated. The Mil­wau­kee Bucks walked out be­fore an Aug 26 play-off game against the Or­lando Magic in re­sponse to the po­lice shoot­ing of Ja­cob Blake in Wis­con­sin. That led to a three-day shut­down – with a can­cel­la­tion of the rest of the sea­son averted.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther “dif­fi­cult ne­go­ti­a­tions” be­tween the league and the union, as Sil­ver de­scribed them at a news con­fer­ence, await for next sea­son’s terms. The sides, though, could also use a break af­ter a sea­son that lasted a whop­ping 380 days.</p>
    <p>It took a bub­ble with un­fore­seen dura­bil­ity, so sturdy that “bub­ble” is now a com­mon word in the NBA lex­i­con, to shep­herd ev­ery­one through the past three months to fash­ion a fin­ish to the long­est, most tur­bu­lent sea­son in league history.</p>
