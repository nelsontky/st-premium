    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has an im­por­tant mes­sage for Sin­ga­pore­ans as they gear up for phase three of the coun­try’s re­open­ing: Stay cau­tious and vig­i­lant, con­tinue to co­op­er­ate with the Gov­ern­ment and abide by the rules to keep the virus at bay.</p>
    <p>“Please do not aban­don your mind­set of watch­ful­ness and cau­tion,” he urged them yesterday in a tele­vised na­tional ad­dress.</p>
    <p>“This is ab­so­lutely not the time to re­lax, and let our guard down or to hold a big party, imag­in­ing that the prob­lem has dis­ap­peared.”</p>
    <p>In his speech, PM Lee an­nounced that Singapore will start phase three of its re­open­ing on Dec 28, with the cap on group sizes for so­cial gath­er­ings raised from five to eight.</p>
    <p>He also said the first ship­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines will ar­rive by the end of this month. There will be enough for ev­ery­one in Singapore to get the jab by the third quar­ter of next year if things go ac­cord­ing to plan, he added.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tions will be free for all Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents who wish to take them.</p>
    <p>“Now that vac­cines are be­com­ing avail­able, we can see light at the end of the tun­nel,” PM Lee said. “As vac­ci­na­tions be­come wide­spread not only in Singapore, but also in our re­gion and the world, we can look for­ward to re­sum­ing more nor­mal lives.”</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual press con­fer­ence af­ter PM Lee’s ad­dress, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng com­pared Singapore’s achieve­ments so far to a moun­taineer reach­ing the base camp of a moun­tain, with the as­cent to the sum­mit still ly­ing ahead.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, on the other hand, called it the fi­nal stretch of a marathon.</p>
    <p>“This fi­nal stretch is still go­ing to be a long one, and it is prob­a­bly go­ing to be the most dif­fi­cult part of the race,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So, we re­ally need to stay dis­ci­plined and fo­cused all the way through the end.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, co-chair of the mul­ti­min­is­te­rial task force tack­ling the pan­demic, was also at the ses­sion.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, in his na­tional broad­cast, noted that it has been nearly a year – “full of ups and downs, filled with anx­i­ety and trep­i­da­tion” – since Singapore’s first Covid-19 case on Jan 23.</p>
    <p>But much has changed in the last few months, he said.</p>
    <p>The coun­try, for one thing, has brought the daily num­ber of new cases down from more than 1,000 in March and April to zero lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases on most days.</p>
    <p>When the cri­sis started, peo­ple were also wor­ried about su­per­mar­kets hav­ing enough sup­plies, and par­ents were ap­pre­hen­sive about send­ing their chil­dren to school.</p>
    <p>Now, su­per­mar­ket shelves are full and shop­ping is calm and un­event­ful, PM Lee noted. The school year has been kept in­tact, and life is more nor­mal than it was dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“How did we bring things un­der con­trol? It took a tremen­dous ef­fort and some good luck.”</p>
    <p>He said the tough mea­sures to tackle the virus worked, and Sin­ga­pore­ans showed re­silience and took them in their stride.</p>
    <p>“Our econ­omy took a big hit, but we did not let it crash,” he added. “De­spite the global eco­nomic dis­lo­ca­tion, most of our work­ers kept their jobs.”</p>
    <p>Now, Singapore’s de­fences against Covid-19 are much stronger, he said, cit­ing how the coun­try has built up its test­ing pro­ce­dures and ca­pac­i­ties, with ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of higher risk groups and anti­gen rapid tests at larger gath­er­ings and events.</p>
    <p>It has also beefed up its con­tact trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, such as ex­pand­ing the SafeEn­try and TraceTo­gether pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“We got used to the in­con­ve­nient re­stric­tions, and found ways to carry on with life,” PM Lee said. “We looked af­ter one an­other, re­mind­ing each other to ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing, to wear masks, to see a doc­tor if ill, and so on.”</p>
    <p>He also ex­pressed his grat­i­tude to Sin­ga­pore­ans who com­plied with the spirit of the rules, adding: “We can be proud of how far we have come.”</p>
    <p>Round­ing up his speech, PM Lee said Singapore re­acted quickly and com­pre­hen­sively dur­ing the cri­sis, mar­shalling re­sources to solve its prob­lems and stay­ing re­silient.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is sta­ble now only be­cause ev­ery­one has worked so hard and sac­ri­ficed so much, he added.</p>
    <p>“Let us keep up our ef­forts in this fi­nal stretch, to cross the fin­ish line to­gether and com­plete our mis­sion to de­feat Covid-19.”</p>
