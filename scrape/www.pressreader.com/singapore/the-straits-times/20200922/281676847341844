    <p>There were 31 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,606.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded nine new im­ported cases – seven who had re­turned from India, and two from Iran. All had been placed on stay-home no­tices on ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There were no new cases in the community.</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore and Plaza Sin­ga­pura were among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, said the Min­istry of Health yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes, and the times at which they were there, so those who were at these places at the time can mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>MOH said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 22 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among these, 16 were con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases who had al­ready been quar­an­tined, and were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing six cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as the rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters were an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the community has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks, said the min­istry, while the num­ber of un­linked cases in the community has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day for the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 60 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,226 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 36 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal while 302 are re­cu­per­at­ing in community fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
