    <p>The avi­a­tion sec­tor here will re­ceive ad­di­tional gov­ern­ment sup­port to the tune of $84 mil­lion, as con­tin­ued re­cov­ery from the Covid-19 pan­demic is ex­pected to be slow.</p>
    <p>This fur­ther fi­nan­cial aid will help the in­dus­try deal with in­creased op­er­a­tional costs and train­ing schemes, as well as in­vest­ments in pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) said yes­ter­day that the new sup­port mea­sures are crit­i­cal to re­viv­ing Sin­ga­pore’s air hub and pre­par­ing it for the re­cov­ery of air travel.</p>
    <p>“Given on­go­ing bor­der re­stric­tions and the resur­gence of Covid-19 in many coun­tries over win­ter, air travel will not re­cover soon.</p>
    <p>“It is there­fore crit­i­cal that we main­tain our sup­port for the sec­tor to help avi­a­tion com­pa­nies and work­ers tide through the cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>CAAS said $39 mil­lion will go towards help­ing com­pa­nies deal with ex­tra costs in­curred dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It said that com­pa­nies have spent sig­nif­i­cant sums on mea­sures to fa­cil­i­tate safe air travel with min­imised pub­lic health risks.</p>
    <p>It noted that these mea­sures re­quire more spending, but such costs “can­not be re­cov­ered from pas­sen­gers dur­ing this pe­riod”.</p>
    <p>“To help mit­i­gate some of these costs, the Gov­ern­ment will pro­vide fund­ing to sup­port the de­vel­op­ment, adop­tion and de­ploy­ment of in­no­va­tive tech­nolo­gies and mea­sures to pro­tect our air­port work­ers and air crew from con­tract­ing Covid-19,” said CAAS.</p>
    <p>“These in­clude air­craft and bag­gage sani­ti­sa­tion sys­tems.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also con­tinue to give re­bates for fees and charges. For ex­am­ple, CAAS will waive the fees payable by Sin­ga­pore-based air­lines for air­wor­thi­ness cer­tifi­cates.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, about $20 mil­lion will be set aside to sup­port the train­ing of work­ers in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Pilots, air traf­fic con­trollers and air­craft main­te­nance en­gi­neers who have to pay their li­cence fees and med­i­cal eval­u­a­tion fees will get a full re­bate for fees payable be­tween April this year and March next year.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion work­ers who are at risk of los­ing their jobs or be­ing un­der­em­ployed will get help in learn­ing new skills to fa­cil­i­tate a move to other jobs in the sec­tor. More de­tails on the new pro­grammes will be an­nounced next month.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Sin­ga­pore-based air­lines will get fund­ing sup­port to re­train their pilots and keep their skills cur­rent. CAAS said this was needed to en­sure a suf­fi­cient num­ber of pilots for the even­tual re­cov­ery of the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing $25 mil­lion will come in the form of an in­jec­tion into the Avi­a­tion De­vel­op­ment Fund. CAAS said this will pro­vide an en­hanced level of fund­ing sup­port of up to 90 per cent to com­pa­nies un­til March 31, 2022, for their ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>It added: “Such pro­duc­tiv­ity ef­forts will im­prove the at­trac­tive­ness of the sec­tor to Sin­ga­pore­ans, sup­port the em­ploy­a­bil­ity of older work­ers and re­duce the sec­tor’s re­liance on for­eign work­force in the longer term.”</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said in a Face­book video that pas­sen­ger vol­umes at Changi Air­port re­main at just 2 per cent of pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>He added that the most important task is to bring back air travel safely and re­vive the avi­a­tion hub.</p>
    <p>“(This) is why we are open­ing our borders to coun­tries and places which have con­trolled the virus suc­cess­fully, and forg­ing air travel bub­bles,” he said.</p>
    <p>“To­gether, we will tide through this ar­du­ous jour­ney and take our place in the skies again.”</p>
    <p>NO NEAR-TERM RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>Given on­go­ing bor­der re­stric­tions and the resur­gence of Covid-19 in many coun­tries over win­ter, air travel will not re­cover soon. It is there­fore crit­i­cal that we main­tain our sup­port for the sec­tor to help avi­a­tion com­pa­nies and work­ers tide through the cri­sis.</p>
