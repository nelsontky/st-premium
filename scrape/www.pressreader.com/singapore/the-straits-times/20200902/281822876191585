    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s de­clas­si­fi­ca­tion of two 1982 ca­bles that af­firmed the United States’ com­mit­ment to Tai­wan’s se­cu­rity at the time sig­nals the con­tin­u­a­tion of its sup­port for the is­land’s de­fence in the face of a grow­ing mil­i­tary threat from China, an­a­lysts have said.</p>
    <p>The ca­bles, which were de­clas­si­fied on July 16, were posted on the web­site of the Amer­i­can In­sti­tute in Tai­wan (AIT), the US’ de facto em­bassy in Taipei, on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The de­clas­si­fi­ca­tion was sep­a­rately an­nounced by Mr David Stil­well, the US As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State for East Asian and Pa­cific Af­fairs, at a vir­tual fo­rum on the same day. In do­ing so, he said the six as­sur­ances made by then US Pres­i­dent Ron­ald Rea­gan to Tai­wan that were de­tailed in the ca­bles “en­dure to­day”.</p>
    <p>Among the as­sur­ances – made when the US signed a joint com­mu­nique with China in 1982 in which Wash­ing­ton com­mit­ted to grad­u­ally re­duc­ing arms sales to Tai­wan – was one that stated that the US had not agreed to set a date for end­ing arms sales to the is­land.</p>
    <p>The AIT on its web­site said one of ca­bles sought to ex­plain that US will­ing­ness to re­duce arms sales to Tai­wan was premised on the con­tin­ued com­mit­ment of China to a peace­ful res­o­lu­tion of cross-strait dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>China, since Ms Tsai Ing-wen of the in­de­pen­dence-lean­ing Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party was first elected Tai­wan’s Pres­i­dent in 2016 and failed to ac­knowl­edge the “one China” prin­ci­ple, has sought to squeeze the is­land’s in­ter­na­tional space and its econ­omy.</p>
    <p>It has also put mil­i­tary pres­sure on the is­land by in­creas­ing the fre­quency and scale of mil­i­tary ex­er­cises in the Tai­wan Strait and send­ing its mil­i­tary air­craft and war­ships close to the is­land.</p>
    <p>In the face of these pres­sures from China, the Tai­wanese govern­ment has wel­comed moves by the ad­min­is­tra­tion of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to strengthen ties with the is­land, at a time when US-China ties are them­selves fraught.</p>
    <p>These moves in­cluded vis­its to Tai­wan by se­nior of­fi­cials, such as US Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar who last month be­came the high­est-level US of­fi­cial to visit the is­land in four decades.</p>
    <p>It raised ten­sions a notch as the Chi­nese flew a fighter jet across the mid-line of the Tai­wan Strait and con­ducted mil­i­tary ex­er­cises in the sen­si­tive wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>In the midst of these ten­sions, noted Tai­wanese de­fence ex­pert An­drew Yang, there has been a lot of de­bate in Tai­wan over whether the US is com­mit­ted to as­sist­ing Tai­wan in the face of in­creas­ing mil­i­tary threat from China.</p>
    <p>Former Tai­wanese pres­i­dent Ma Ying-jeou, who pur­sued a China-friendly pol­icy dur­ing his ten­ure, last month warned that Tai­wan risked get­ting caught in the power strug­gle be­tween China and the US, while former se­nior se­cu­rity of­fi­cial Su Chi said ear­lier this year it was “wish­ful think­ing” that the US would come to the res­cue of Tai­wan in the event of an at­tack by China.</p>
    <p>There­fore, Wash­ing­ton’s re­it­er­a­tion of the six as­sur­ances, demon­strat­ing its com­mit­ment to them, is wel­comed by both the Tai­wanese govern­ment and the Tai­wanese peo­ple, said Mr Yang.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese an­a­lyst Shi Yin­hong of Ren­min Univer­sity thought the US’ lat­est move was equiv­a­lent to the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion say­ing it would guar­an­tee the se­cu­rity of Tai­wan. This, to­gether with the prom­ise of a new eco­nomic di­a­logue, was a show of sup­port for Ms Tsai and for Tai­wan, he added.</p>
    <p>“This will en­cour­age Tsai to per­sist in con­fronting the main­land, per­sist in re­ject­ing the 1992 con­sen­sus on the one China prin­ci­ple and per­sist in ac­cus­ing China of sub­vert­ing Tai­wan’s demo­cratic sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>“Tai­wan and the US’ ac­tions have in­creased the threat of a large-scale armed con­flict” in the Tai­wan</p>
    <p>Strait, he warned.</p>
    <p>Still, an­a­lysts do not think that an armed con­flict in the Tai­wan Strait is likely at this point in time as none of the three – the US, China and Tai­wan – has the stom­ach for one.</p>
    <p>While there is a lot of mil­i­tary pos­tur­ing in the Tai­wan Strait area, said Mr Yang, Bei­jing has re­peat­edly em­pha­sised that it has no in­ten­tion of cre­at­ing a phys­i­cal mil­i­tary con­flict there.</p>
    <p>“Nei­ther does Tai­wan want to pro­voke Bei­jing (in such a way) that it re­sults in a mil­i­tary clash,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the US would also not want a sit­u­a­tion where it was forced to re­spond, as pub­lic opin­ion there did not want war with a ma­jor power like China.</p>
