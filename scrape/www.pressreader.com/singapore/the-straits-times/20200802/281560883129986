    <p>PETALING JAYA • Malaysia joined the likes of Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong and Viet­nam yes­ter­day when it be­came manda­tory to wear face masks in pub­lic places to stem the tide of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Those found flout­ing the new rule will face a fine of up to RM1,000 (S$324).</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the height of the coron­avirus out­break in March, when Malaysia in­tro­duced a par­tial shut­down, face masks were re­quired to be worn only by health­care work­ers and those show­ing symp­toms of the virus.</p>
    <p>In early June, the health au­thor­i­ties eased the shut­down mea­sures – re­ferred to as the move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) – as the num­ber of new in­fec­tions fell and the country en­tered a re­cov­ery phase. How­ever, the num­ber of new cases has risen again since then.</p>
    <p>On July 23, Senior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob an­nounced that Malaysians will be re­quired to wear face masks in pub­lic ar­eas.</p>
    <p>He said the de­ci­sion was made fol­low­ing the in­crease of Covid-19 cases and the pub­lic’s gen­eral fail­ure to com­ply with safety pro­ce­dures on so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>He said the gov­ern­ment had pre­vi­ously re­frained from mak­ing face masks com­pul­sory be­cause it did not want to add to the fi­nan­cial bur­den of the lower-in­come group.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in Kota Tinggi, Jo­hor, yes­ter­day fined 26 peo­ple RM1,000 each for not wear­ing face masks while they were at the beach. Mean­while, po­lice in Petaling Jaya, Se­lan­gor, said they would not is­sue fines in the first cou­ple of days, to al­low peo­ple time to get used to the habit of wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal Prac­ti­tion­ers Coali­tion As­so­ci­a­tion of Malaysia pres­i­dent Raj Ku­mar Ma­hara­jah said wear­ing face masks helps keep the in­fec­tiv­ity rate or the R-naught (R0) rate un­der 1.0, which means that the prob­a­bil­ity of an in­fected per­son spread­ing it to oth­ers can be min­imised.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the MCO, the R0 rate was at 0.3. It is now at 1.36.</p>
    <p>“Wear­ing face masks could pre­vent a sec­ond wave of the virus,” Dr Raj said. “This sacri­fice is needed from ev­ery­one – at least un­til a vac­cine is ready.”</p>
    <p>Apart from wear­ing face masks, Dr Raj said phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing, good hy­giene and iso­la­tion – for ex­am­ple, by work­ing from home – can also help pre­vent the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has ad­vised peo­ple to wear a face mask in pub­lic where there is com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion and when so­cial dis­tanc­ing is not pos­si­ble. The WHO said that healthy peo­ple wear­ing face masks can re­duce the po­ten­tial risk of ex­po­sure from in­fected per­sons who had yet to de­velop symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Malaysian health chief Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah at­trib­uted the resur­gence of cases to the “pub­lic’s com­pla­cency and their non-com­pli­ance with the stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dure (SOP) set by the gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>There have been in­ci­dents where re­turn­ing trav­ellers breached their manda­tory home quar­an­tine, and were spot­ted din­ing at restau­rants when they were sup­posed to be at home.</p>
    <p>Datuk Dr Noor Hisham pointed out that if non-com­pli­ance and pub­lic com­pla­cency con­tin­ued, there was a pos­si­bil­ity of another wave of trans­mis­sions if the R0 ex­ceeded 1.6.</p>
    <p>A poll con­ducted on The Star’s Face­book page on July 21 found that most Malaysians were re­cep­tive to wear­ing masks, with 41,200 out of 45,700 peo­ple agree­ing that face masks should be made com­pul­sory in pub­lic ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­ported nine new coron­avirus cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the total num­ber of in­fec­tions to 8,985. No new fa­tal­i­ties were recorded, keep­ing the death toll at 125 since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
