    <p>For weeks, Sabah Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal was on edge as ru­mours swirled that his state gov­ern­ment was about to col­lapse, and one assem­bly­man af­ter an­other from his state’s rul­ing coali­tion jumped ship.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, the num­bers game was over for him, and Sabah once again lived up to its rep­u­ta­tion as Malaysia’s wild, wild east, pop­u­lated by politi­cians no­to­ri­ous for their “frog cul­ture” of party-hop­ping.</p>
    <p>By then, Datuk Seri Shafie’s long-time ri­val and for­mer chief min­is­ter Musa Aman had gar­nered the sup­port of 33 of Sabah’s 65 as­sem­bly­men. The next day, the state assem­bly was dis­solved.</p>
    <p>There seems to be no end to Malaysia’s po­lit­i­cal tur­bu­lence. News of the Sabah snap elec­tion al­most eclipsed the ear­lier news of the stun­ning con­vic­tion of for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak.</p>
    <p>And for good rea­son – the out­come of the Sabah elec­tion will be a cru­cial test for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Since com­ing to power in March, his hold on the un­wieldy Perikatan Na­sional (PN) rul­ing coali­tion has been pre­car­i­ous, chal­lenged as much from within as well as with­out by the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>His PN gov­ern­ment is hold­ing on with just a two-seat ma­jor­ity (113 MPs in the 222-seat fed­eral Par­lia­ment), and it will be dis­as­trous for him if the Sabah state polls, which must take place within 60 days of the assem­bly’s dis­so­lu­tion, do not go his way.</p>
    <p>Sabah will be a bat­tle­ground to test how PN, which is es­sen­tially a coali­tion of frenemies, will fare in the war ahead, that is, the next gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The co­he­sive­ness of PN, where the part­ners have over­lap­ping in­ter­ests in seats in al­most every state, in­clud­ing Sabah, will also be tested.</p>
    <p>A key ques­tion here is: Can the frenemies in PN, namely Umno and Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu), agree on which seats each should con­test with­out an open row?</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing part­ners in the same coali­tion, ties be­tween Umno and Ber­satu are quite tense.</p>
    <p>Umno is still sore with Ber­satu for “steal­ing” its as­sem­bly­men a few months af­ter the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen of the 17 Umno as­sem­bly­men, some of whom are rel­a­tives of Tan Sri Musa, had aban­doned their party to join Mr Shafie’s party.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some of them now claim their body left Umno but their heart is still with the party. The dis­pute go­ing on be­hind the scenes is about whether Umno or</p>
    <p>Ber­satu has more claim to the seats.</p>
    <p>Many an­a­lysts had also writ­ten off Umno as fin­ished in Sabah, fol­low­ing the mass crossovers. The up­com­ing state elec­tion presents an op­por­tu­nity for Umno to at­tempt a come­back at the state and na­tional level.</p>
    <p>For Mr Shafie, whose Parti Warisan Sabah is with the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) op­po­si­tion coali­tion, and Mr Musa, who is aligned with the PN rul­ing coali­tion, there are per­sonal stakes as well.</p>
    <p>Both men have been like two tigers on a hill, long-time ri­vals for con­trol over Sabah’s pol­i­tics. The snap elec­tion could be the fi­nal bat­tle be­tween them, es­pe­cially given that Mr Musa is 69 and moves around with the aid of a cane.</p>
    <p>“Sabah ba­si­cally had a hung assem­bly in the gen­eral elec­tion. I won’t be sur­prised if the snap elec­tion pro­duces an­other 50-50 kind of out­come, with­out any real win­ner. It will mean more in­sta­bil­ity if that hap­pens,” said Sabah-born Dr Arnold Puyok, a se­nior lec­turer at Univer­siti Malaysia Sarawak.</p>
    <p>Dr Arnold said Mr Shafie’s ad­van­tage is that as the care­taker chief min­is­ter, he has ac­cess to state fa­cil­i­ties in his cam­paign.</p>
    <p>He can also play the sym­pa­thy card and claim he is go­ing back to the peo­ple be­cause his gov­ern­ment is un­der siege. He is a su­perb or­a­tor with the abil­ity to cap­ti­vate the crowd at po­lit­i­cal ral­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Musa, said Dr Arnold, has the back­ing of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment and the im­mense re­sources that come with it.</p>
    <p>But there seems to be some strange karma sur­round­ing what is go­ing on in the state.</p>
    <p>Mr Shafie ac­tu­ally came to power in Sabah through the back door af­ter the gen­eral elec­tion. His coali­tion and the Barisan Na­sional (BN) team, then led by Mr Musa, were tied, with each hav­ing 29 seats while an­other party, Sabah Star, had two seats.</p>
    <p>Mr Musa man­aged to get Sabah Star to come on board to form the gov­ern­ment. How­ever, hours af­ter Mr Musa was sworn in as the chief min­is­ter, Mr Shafie man­aged to get six BN as­sem­bly­men to cross over to his side, and that was how he be­came the new chief min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>More crossovers in the state fol­lowed, en­cour­aged by then</p>
    <p>Pre­mier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad to strengthen the PH coali­tion. It was very messy and highly un­eth­i­cal, and now nei­ther side is in a po­si­tion to ac­cuse the other of form­ing back­door gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>What goes around comes around, and Mr Shafie’s crit­ics say he is get­ting a taste of his own medicine.</p>
    <p>“All this is build­ing up to an early gen­eral elec­tion, which could be as soon as a few months from now,” said po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tor Khaw Veon Szu.</p>
    <p>A vic­tory for Mr Muhyid­din in the Sabah state polls will pos­si­bly in­spire him to go for an early gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But what if Mr Shafie emerges the vic­tor?</p>
    <p>Mr Shafie had been named as a po­ten­tial prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date for PH. Hold­ing on to the Sabah vic­tory will be a huge boost to his pres­tige.</p>
    <p>But as things stand now, the out­come of the Sabah polls is sim­ply too close to call.</p>
