    <p>At the Koon Chun Sauce Fac­tory, work­ers are scram­bling to cover hun­dreds of thou­sands of cans with new “Made in China” la­bels. From Novem­ber, the pop­u­lar Hong Kong brand can no longer place the phrase “Made in Hong Kong” on prod­ucts ex­ported to the United States – part of Washington’s re­sponse to Bei­jing’s im­po­si­tion of a new se­cu­rity law on the city.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • At the Koon Chun Sauce Fac­tory, work­ers are scram­bling to cover hun­dreds of thou­sands of cans with new “Made in China” la­bels as the pop­u­lar Hong Kong brand falls vic­tim to spi­ralling diplo­matic ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Founded nearly a cen­tury ago, the fam­ily-owned fac­tory has sur­vived a world war, mul­ti­ple eco­nomic crises and the slow with­er­ing of Hong Kong’s man­u­fac­tur­ing base as com­pa­nies looked for cheaper labour in main­land China.</p>
    <p>It re­mains one of the fi­nan­cial hub’s most en­dur­ing brands, churn­ing out culi­nary sta­ples such as soya, hoisin and oys­ter sauces found in Chi­nese restau­rants and kitchens around the world.</p>
    <p>But from Novem­ber it can no longer place the words “Made in Hong Kong” on any prod­ucts ex­ported to the United States – part of Washington’s re­sponse to Bei­jing im­pos­ing a tough new se­cu­rity law on the rest­less city.</p>
    <p>The new rules, an­nounced by US Cus­toms in July, came just two days be­fore a Koon Chun ship­ment of 1,300 boxes was about to set sail for At­lanta. The fac­tory sud­denly had to re-la­bel the en­tire ship­ment and all other cargo the firm planned to ship to the US this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>“It was a mis­sion im­pos­si­ble,” Mr Daniel Chan told Agence France-Presse from the fac­tory his great­grand­fa­ther founded in 1928.</p>
    <p>China im­posed, in June, a new se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong to stamp out huge and of­ten vi­o­lent prodemoc­racy protests that con­vulsed the city last year.</p>
    <p>Both Bei­jing and the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties said the law would have no im­pact on busi­nesses and would re­store sta­bil­ity. But eco­nomic con­se­quences have rip­pled through the re­ces­sion-hit hub as the au­thor­i­ties use the new pow­ers to pur­sue po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Rat­tled tech firms have de­clined to share data with lo­cal po­lice while some firms and uni­ver­si­ties are strug­gling to at­tract global tal­ent. Banks have found them­selves caught in an im­pos­si­ble sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The US has sanc­tioned key Chi­nese and Hong Kong of­fi­cials in re­sponse to the law. But that same se­cu­rity law also for­bids com­pa­nies from com­ply­ing with any for­eign sanc­tions regime.</p>
    <p>An­other vic­tim has been the “Made in Hong Kong” brand, a la­bel that firms can place on prod­ucts made ex­clu­sively in the city.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has turned in­creas­ingly hawk­ish to­wards China as he seeks re-elec­tion, and the crack­down on democ­racy sup­port­ers in Hong Kong has given him fresh am­mu­ni­tion. This sum­mer, the US de­clared Hong Kong no longer suf­fi­ciently au­tonomous to jus­tify spe­cial trad­ing sta­tus. In­stead it would be treated like any other Chi­nese city.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, who stud­ied at Har­vard Univer­sity, said he ex­pected the po­lit­i­cal land­scape would shift in Hong Kong. But he never thought it would come so fast.</p>
    <p>“I en­vi­sioned some­thing closer to 2047, when Hong Kong is of­fi­cially with­out one coun­try two sys­tems,” Mr Chan said, re­fer­ring to the China promise to let Hong Kong keep key lib­er­ties and au­ton­omy for 50 years af­ter the 1997 han­dover from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The past few weeks have been a blur of ac­tiv­ity at the sauce fac­tory as its 90 em­ploy­ees try to ad­just to the new re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>On top of the stop-gap stick­ers, new la­bels are be­ing drawn up for US ex­ports – the large “Made in Hong Kong” let­ter­ing re­placed with a much smaller “Made in China” dec­la­ra­tion. Much time has been spent re­ar­rang­ing stor­age for now-de­layed cargo ship­ments.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies were given a re­prieve when Hong Kong’s Com­merce Min­is­ter Ed­ward Yau said Washington had post­poned the la­bel rule un­til early Novem­ber, af­ter the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“This buys us a lit­tle bit of time,” Mr Chan said. But he de­scribed it as “a short-term so­lu­tion to this whole po­lit­i­cally in­spired fi­asco”.</p>
    <p>Mr Yau has slammed the la­belling change and threat­ened to take the United States to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>He also stressed that Hong Kong-made ship­ments to the US were worth just HK$3.7 bil­lion (S$651.5 mil­lion) in 2019, less than 0.1 per cent of the city’s gross ex­ports.</p>
    <p>But that is lit­tle con­so­la­tion for Mr Chan, who says around half his prod­ucts go to the US, where the brand is es­pe­cially pop­u­lar with the large Chi­nese di­as­pora in North Amer­ica. Look­ing ahead, Mr Chan fears more in­ter­na­tional mar­kets may fol­low Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“In 20 years, 30 years from now, peo­ple will only have ‘Made in China’ and for­get about Hong Kong,” Mr Chan said. “That’s very sad.”</p>
