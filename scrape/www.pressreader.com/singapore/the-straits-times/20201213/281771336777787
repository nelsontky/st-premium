    <p>HAULAGE</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has warned that there will be dis­rup­tion at its ports with or with­out a deal, as Bri­tain leaves the sin­gle mar­ket and the Cus­toms union.</p>
    <p>In a worst-case sce­nario, even with a trade deal, 7,000 trucks head­ing for the Chan­nel ports in south-east Eng­land could be held in 100km-long queues if com­pa­nies do not pre­pare the ex­tra pa­per­work re­quired.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion set out con­tin­gency mea­sures on Thurs­day to main­tain con­nec­tions by road freight and for road pas­sen­gers for six months.</p>
    <p>VE­HI­CLES</p>
    <p>The im­pact of no-deal will be felt sharply by the car in­dus­try in both Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union, with Bri­tish car­mak­ers fac­ing a 10 per cent tar­iff on all car ex­ports to the EU and up to 22 per cent for trucks and vans.</p>
    <p>The bill would al­most cer­tainly be passed on to con­sumers, with a pre­dicted €57.7 bil­lion (S$93.5 bil­lion) in costs for EU plants and costs of €52.8 bil­lion for Bri­tish plants over five years.</p>
    <p>Car­mak­ers in Bri­tain have bol­stered sup­plies of parts to keep pro­duc­tion go­ing or have been se­cur­ing ad­di­tional sup­ply routes.</p>
    <p>Bent­ley, the lux­ury car­maker owned by Volk­swa­gen, has booked five Antonov cargo jets to help over­come po­ten­tial sup­ply prob­lems.</p>
    <p>FOOD AND SU­PER­MAR­KETS</p>
    <p>With nearly a third of Bri­tain’s food com­ing from the EU, gro­cers fear sig­nif­i­cant dis­rup­tion to their sup­ply chains when the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>De­lays of even a few days at ports could make fresh pro­duce un­saleable and lead to short­ages.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s re­tail­ers have warned that with­out a tar­iff-free trade deal, con­sumers face higher prices. The av­er­age tar­iff on food im­ported from the EU would be more than 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>AVI­A­TION AND CHAN­NEL TUN­NEL</p>
    <p>Un­der cur­rent ar­range­ments, Bri­tish and EU air­lines can fly any routes they wish within the bloc.</p>
    <p>The EU con­tin­gency mea­sures set out on Thurs­day would main­tain “cer­tain air ser­vices” be­tween Bri­tain and the EU for up to six months, pro­vided Lon­don en­sures the same.</p>
    <p>Air safety mea­sures would con­tinue to be recog­nised, to avoid ground­ing air­craft.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rate reg­u­la­tion, if ap­proved by EU mem­ber states, would al­low the Chan­nel Tun­nel road and rail link to con­tinue for two months, un­til Bri­tain and France agree on new safety and su­per­vi­sion cer­tifi­cates.</p>
    <p>PHAR­MA­CEU­TI­CALS</p>
    <p>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal pro­duc­tion in the 27 EU coun­tries would be hit by a no-deal sce­nario to the tune of €4.6 bil­lion an­nu­ally, with Ire­land and Bel­gium worst af­fected, ac­cord­ing to a re­port funded by the Euro­pean Fed­er­a­tion of Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal In­dus­tries and As­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ex­ports are ex­pected to drop by 22.5 per cent in a no-deal out­come, the re­port added.</p>
    <p>Many medicines will re­main ex­empt from tar­iffs but there will be higher costs caused by any fail­ure to agree on an ex­ten­sion of ex­ist­ing co­op­er­a­tion on prod­uct man­u­fac­tur­ing and test­ing.</p>
