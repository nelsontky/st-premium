    <p>WASHINGTON Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump yes­ter­day pre­pared to re­turn to the cam­paign trail with two week­end ral­lies af­ter his Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis side­lined him for a week in the race against Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den for the White House.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who an­nounced he had been in­fected with the coro­n­avirus on Oct 2 and spent three nights in a mil­i­tary hos­pi­tal re­ceiv­ing treat­ment, said late on Thurs­day he was feel­ing “re­ally good” and, with a doc­tor’s bless­ing, aimed to cam­paign in Florida to­day and in Penn­syl­va­nia to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ill­ness has kept him from criss-cross­ing the coun­try to rally sup­port and raise cash in the fi­nal weeks be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>A re­turn to in-per­son events would be aimed at con­vinc­ing vot­ers he is healthy enough to cam­paign and to gov­ern.</p>
    <p>While Mr Trump has re­leased sev­eral videos on Twit­ter, he has not ap­peared in pub­lic since he re­turned home from the hos­pi­tal on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has con­tin­ued to cam­paign, with events sched­uled yes­ter­day in Las Ve­gas, Ne­vada.</p>
    <p>The US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion guide­lines say peo­ple who are se­verely ill with Covid-19 might need to stay home for up to 20 days af­ter symp­toms first ap­pear.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who has sharply crit­i­cised Mr Trump’s han­dling of the pan­demic, is beat­ing his Repub­li­can ri­val in na­tional polls, though that lead is nar­rower in some of the swing states that may de­ter­mine the elec­tion’s out­come.</p>
    <p>White House physi­cian Sean Con­ley said in a memo re­leased on Thurs­day that Mr Trump had com­pleted his course of ther­apy for Covid-19, re­mained sta­ble since re­turn­ing home from the hos­pi­tal and could re­sume pub­lic en­gage­ments to­day.</p>
    <p>Sound­ing hoarse and oc­ca­sion­ally paus­ing and clear­ing his throat, Mr Trump told Fox News host Sean Han­nity in an in­ter­view late on Thurs­day that he was likely to be tested for the virus yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The White House has de­clined to say when Mr Trump last tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>“I feel so good,” Mr Trump said. The Pres­i­dent was ex­pected to host a “vir­tual rally” yes­ter­day by ap­pear­ing on con­ser­va­tive ra­dio host Rush Lim­baugh’s ra­dio pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The Trump and Bi­den cam­paigns sparred on Thurs­day over a tele­vised de­bate that had been planned for next week.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump pulled out af­ter the non-par­ti­san com­mis­sion in charge said the Oct 15 event would be held vir­tu­ally with the can­di­dates in sep­a­rate lo­ca­tions be­cause of health and safety con­cerns af­ter Mr Trump con­tracted Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign ar­ranged a town hall-style event in Philadel­phia in­stead.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s White House and cam­paign have ex­pe­ri­enced an out­break of the virus in the last week, with mul­ti­ple top aides, in­clud­ing the Pres­i­dent’s press sec­re­tary and cam­paign man­ager, test­ing pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and his staff have largely es­chewed wear­ing masks, against the guid­ance of health pro­fes­sion­als, and held ral­lies with thou­sands of peo­ple in in­door and out­door venues, de­spite rec­om­men­da­tions against hav­ing events with large crowds.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s health will re­main in the spot­light even if he begins hold­ing events again.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, US Democrats on Thurs­day pro­posed a com­mis­sion to in­ves­ti­gate whether Mr Trump is men­tally fit for of­fice – and look at the con­sti­tu­tional op­tions for his re­moval if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yes­ter­day told re­porters that she and other Democrats would in­tro­duce a mea­sure re­lat­ing to the US Con­sti­tu­tion’s 25th Amend­ment, which al­lows for the Vice-Pres­i­dent to take over should it be de­ter­mined that the Pres­i­dent “is un­able” to ful­fil his du­ties.</p>
    <p>Ms Pelosi’s of­fice said yes­ter­day’s Bill would “help en­sure ef­fec­tive and un­in­ter­rupted lead­er­ship in the high­est of­fice in the ex­ec­u­tive branch of gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has fired off a stream of er­ratic tweets this week and raised eye­brows with a stream-of-con­scious­ness in­ter­view early on Thurs­day on Fox Business, in which he said he beat the coro­n­avirus be­cause “I am a per­fect phys­i­cal spec­i­men and I’m ex­tremely young”.</p>
    <p>Ms Pelosi warned Mr Trump is suf­fer­ing from a “dis­as­so­ci­a­tion from re­al­ity (that) would be funny if it weren’t so deadly”.</p>
    <p>The Pelosi ef­fort would re­new de­bate about what steps might be taken in the event the Pres­i­dent be­comes dis­abled to such a de­gree he can­not ful­fil his re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But she re­ceived scathing crit­i­cism from Mr Trump and other Repub­li­cans. “Crazy Nancy is the one who should be un­der ob­ser­va­tion. They don’t call her Crazy for noth­ing!” Mr Trump boomed on Twit­ter.</p>
