    <p>Like 4,700 oth­ers, Adrian Staiti and 10 col­leagues from global sports and en­ter­tain­ment agency Sport­five are par­tic­i­pat­ing in The OCBC Cy­cle 2020 Vir­tual Ride, which ends on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>But the group will take their ride to an­other level by at­tempt­ing to col­lec­tively cy­cle the equiv­a­lent of Mount Ever­est’s height of 8,848m by rid­ing up and down Mount Faber on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The route has a ver­ti­cal climb of over 70m so they need to do this 113 times to hit the tar­get.</p>
    <p>But their “Ever­est­ing” chal­lenge does not end there. The fi­nal goal for the group of 11 is 170 rounds.</p>
    <p>Depend­ing on the in­di­vid­ual’s abil­ity, some will do 20 to 30 loops while oth­ers will cy­cle five to 10 – each loop is about 3km.</p>
    <p>To com­plete the OCBC Cy­cle’s The Sportive VR, each per­son will also have to cy­cle 42km.</p>
    <p>Staiti, 45, pres­i­dent of Asia-Pa­cific for Sport­five, told The Straits</p>
    <p>We work in the world of sport so we want to en­cour­age peo­ple to be ac­tive and get out and move. If we can do that and sup­port a good cause, hope­fully we can get more peo­ple think­ing this way.</p>
    <p>Times: “You usu­ally think of cy­cling as an in­di­vid­ual sport but it’s re­ally a team sport. You pace each other and sup­port each other and if, as a team, we can ac­com­plish what we’re aim­ing for, we can do any­thing as a busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>To give the em­ploy­ees ex­tra mo­ti­va­tion, the group is also aim­ing to raise $10,000 for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund.</p>
    <p>Adalia Quek, who works in part­ner­ship mar­ket­ing at the com­pany, said: “When the ini­tia­tive came, I thought it was a great team-bond­ing ac­tiv­ity to do while giv­ing back to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“It’s a per­sonal chal­lenge for me. I know it’s go­ing to be phys­i­cally de</p>
    <p>mand­ing and my mus­cles are go­ing to hurt, so it’s also about over­com­ing the men­tal as­pect of it and I want to see how far I can chal­lenge my­self.”</p>
    <p>Quek, who usu­ally goes for spin classes and does yoga, swim­ming and jog­ging once a week, said she has be­come stronger since she started train­ing for the chal­lenge ev­ery Fri­day morn­ing with her col­leagues 21/ months ago.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally pain­ful af­ter I tried it for the first time. But there was ex­tra mo­ti­va­tion hav­ing my col­leagues there cheer­ing for me and push­ing me on as I cy­cle past them,” said the 35-year-old, who is aim­ing to com­plete at least 10</p>
    <p>rounds on Fri­day. Her max­i­mum is six now.</p>
    <p>“I feel a dif­fer­ence be­cause spin classes are eas­ier now. Phys­i­cally, I feel fit­ter and stronger and I no longer get ex­hausted early on. Train­ing for this helps me keep my­self go­ing for the full class and some­times even be­yond.”</p>
    <p>Some mem­bers of the group also go on their own rides in the Kranji area or round the is­land. The team rides to­gether in groups of five or fewer to ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Staiti, who cy­cles an av­er­age of 150km a week, added: “We work in the world of sport so we want to en­cour­age peo­ple to be ac­tive and get</p>
    <p>out and move.</p>
    <p>“If we can do that and sup­port a good cause, hope­fully we can get more peo­ple think­ing this way and har­ness­ing the power of sport to not only take care of them­selves but also sup­port the com­mu­nity.”</p>
