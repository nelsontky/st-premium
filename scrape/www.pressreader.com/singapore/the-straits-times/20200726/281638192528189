    <p>The new line-up of po­lit­i­cal of­fice­hold­ers and may­ors will in­clude six mem­bers of the Malay com­mu­nity, two of them full min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, who will give up his port­fo­lio in En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources to take on So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, was the only Malay min­is­ter for a while af­ter Pro­fes­sor Yaa­cob</p>
    <p>Ibrahim stepped down from the Cabi­net in April 2018.</p>
    <p>But he will now be joined by Dr Ma­liki Os­man, who has been pro­moted to Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice as well as Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion and For­eign Af­fairs. Dr Ma­liki is cur­rently Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence and For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, an­nounc­ing Dr Ma­liki’s new ap­point­ments, said he had per­formed well and it was time for him to take on more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Two other Malay of­fice-hold­ers will also be pro­moted from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State Zaqy Mo­hamad will be­come a Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and De­fence. He will re­lin­quish his Na­tional De­vel­op­ment port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim will be pro­moted to Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Faishal is cur­rently at the Ed­u­ca­tion and So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment min­istries.</p>
    <p>Back­bencher Ra­hayu Mahzam will be ap­pointed Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health from Sept 1. Ms Ra­hayu, a lawyer, was first elected as an MP for Jurong GRC in 2015.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Mohd Fahmi Ali­man will be the only new Malay MP to be ap­pointed to of­fice. He will be</p>
    <p>Mayor of South East District, a post pre­vi­ously held by Dr Ma­liki.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Mr Masa­gos con­grat­u­lated the Malay MPs on their pro­mo­tions and ac­knowl­edged their hard work to bet­ter the lives of their com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­liki pledged that the Malay MPs would help the com­mu­nity “ride through these very chal­leng­ing times (to) emerge stronger and more con­fi­dent as we achieve our vi­sion of a com­mu­nity of suc­cess”.</p>
    <p>The new line-up also in­cludes six mem­bers of the In­dian com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>They are Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam; Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah, who re­mains Sec­ond Fi­nance Min­is­ter but takes on a new role as Sec­ond Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter; Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran; For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakrishn­an; Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam; and Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health as well as Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Janil Puthuc­heary.</p>
