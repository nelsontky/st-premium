    <p>When it was an­nounced that check­ing in with TraceTo­gether will be manda­tory at all public venues, the choice be­tween us­ing the app or the to­ken seemed to be a no-brainer.</p>
    <p>Of course, I would use the app. Why would I want to carry an ex­tra item around and risk mis­plac­ing or los­ing it?</p>
    <p>But when I re­cently tried us­ing the TraceTo­gether app, I changed my mind.</p>
    <p>I had in­stalled an ear­lier ver­sion of the TraceTo­gether app that did not have the SafeEn­try check-in fea­ture.</p>
    <p>It was only when we were in­formed that en­try to public places will soon re­quire the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken that I re­alised there was a newer ver­sion of the app with ad­di­tional fea­tures.</p>
    <p>Af­ter I down­loaded this new ver­sion, I en­tered the ver­i­fi­ca­tion code but was shown a “wrong OTP en­tered” er­ror mes­sage. Even so, I man­aged to pro­ceed with the rest of the in­stal­la­tion.</p>
    <p>When I vis­ited a mall, the app claimed that the SafeEn­try QR code was not valid. I had to use the SingPass Mo­bile app to en­ter.</p>
    <p>I un­der­stand tech teething prob­lems are com­mon. I e-mailed the TraceTo­gether tech team with de­tails of the prob­lem. I re­ceived a re­ply on Oct 6 say­ing that engi­neers are work­ing on a fix, and have not heard any­thing since. I un­der­stand fixes take time and I can be pa­tient.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, like it or not, I had bet­ter col­lect the to­ken just in case I en­counter any other prob­lems with the app.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is peo­ple like me who are driv­ing up the de­mand for the to­kens.</p>
