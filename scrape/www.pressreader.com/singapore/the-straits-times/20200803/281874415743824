    <p>DUBAI • The United Arab Emi­rates has be­come the first Arab coun­try to open a nu­clear power plant, rais­ing con­cerns about the long-term im­pact of in­tro­duc­ing more nu­clear pro­grammes to the Middle East.</p>
    <p>“UAE first nu­clear re­ac­tor at the Barakah Nu­clear En­ergy Plant has achieved first crit­i­cal­ity and suc­cess­fully started up,” tweeted Am­bas­sador Ha­mad Alka­abi, the coun­try’s rep­re­sen­ta­tive to the In­ter­na­tional Atomic En­ergy Agency, last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“This is a his­toric mile­stone for the nation with a vi­sion to de­liver a new form of clean en­ergy for the nation,” he tweeted in English, along with a photo of tech­ni­cians rais­ing their arms in cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>UAE Pre­mier and ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mo­hammed bin Rashid AlMak­toum, tweeted that work at Barakah had “suc­ceeded in load­ing nu­clear fuel pack­ages, car­ry­ing out com­pre­hen­sive tests and suc­cess­fully com­plet­ing the op­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Con­grat­u­la­tions on re­al­is­ing this his­toric achieve­ment in the en­ergy sec­tor and mark­ing this mile­stone in the road map for sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment, co­in­cid­ing with the Mus­lim hol­i­day of Eid alAdha, comes hot on the heels of the UAE’s launch of the Arab world’s first probe to Mars.</p>
    <p>Two other coun­tries in the re­gion – Is­rael and Iran – al­ready have nu­clear ca­pa­bil­i­ties. Is­rael has an un­ac­knowl­edged nu­clear weapons arsenal and Iran has a con­tro­ver­sial ura­nium en­rich­ment pro­gramme it in­sists is solely for peace­ful pur­poses.</p>
    <p>The UAE, a tiny nation that has be­come a re­gional heavy­weight and in­ter­na­tional busi­ness cen­tre, said it built the plant to de­crease its re­liance on the oil that has pow­ered and en­riched the coun­try and its Gulf neigh­bours for decades.</p>
    <p>Barakah was built by a con­sor­tium led by Korea Elec­tric Power Corp at a cost of some US$24.4 bil­lion (S$33.5 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>When fully op­er­a­tional, the fa­cil­ity’s four re­ac­tors will have the ca­pac­ity to gen­er­ate 5,600MW of elec­tric­ity, about 25 per cent of the nation’s needs.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing to calm fears that it was try­ing to build mus­cle to use against its re­gional ri­vals, the UAE has in­sisted that it in­tends to use its nu­clear pro­gramme only for en­ergy pur­poses.</p>
    <p>But with Iran in a stand-off with Western pow­ers over its nu­clear pro­gramme, Is­rael in the neigh­bour­hood and ten­sions high among Gulf coun­tries, some an­a­lysts view the new plant – and any that may fol­low – as a se­cu­rity and en­vi­ron­men­tal headache. Other Arab coun­tries, in­clud­ing Saudi Ara­bia, are also start­ing or plan­ning their own nu­clear en­ergy pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Qatar, the tar­get of a boy­cott by Saudi Ara­bia, the UAE and oth­ers since June 2017, said last year that the Barakah plant posed a “fla­grant threat to re­gional peace and en­vi­ron­ment”.</p>
    <p>“The UAE’s in­vest­ment in th­ese four nu­clear re­ac­tors risks fur­ther desta­bil­is­ing the volatile Gulf re­gion, dam­ag­ing the en­vi­ron­ment and rais­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of nu­clear pro­lif­er­a­tion,” Dr Paul Dorf­man, a re­searcher at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don’s En­ergy In­sti­tute, wrote in an op-ed in March.</p>
    <p>Of­fer­ing ev­i­dence that its in­ten­tions are peace­ful, the UAE points to its col­lab­o­ra­tions with the In­ter­na­tional Atomic En­ergy Agency, which has re­viewed the Barakah project, and the United States, with which it signed a nu­clear en­ergy co­op­er­a­tion agree­ment in 2009.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment al­lows it to re­ceive nu­clear ma­te­ri­als and tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance from the US while bar­ring it from ura­nium en­rich­ment and other pos­si­ble bomb-de­vel­op­ment ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The nu­clear plant on the Gulf coast west of Abu Dhabi had been due to go on­line in late 2017, but faced a num­ber of de­lays that of­fi­cials at­trib­uted to safety and reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The UAE hopes the plant, be­sides gen­er­at­ing com­pet­i­tively priced elec­tric­ity, will el­e­vate the nation’s sta­tus as a key re­gional player, build­ing on its suc­cess as a hub for tourism, bank­ing and ser­vices.</p>
