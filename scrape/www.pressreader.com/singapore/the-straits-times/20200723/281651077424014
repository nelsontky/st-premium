    <p>Vis­it­ing the Philip­pines is a yearly tra­di­tion for Mrs Ar­chaenne Chuang, whose ex­tended family lives in Manila.</p>
    <p>So it was es­pe­cially dis­ap­point­ing not to be able to make the trip last month, after giv­ing birth to her first­born child in March.</p>
    <p>“I was look­ing for­ward to tak­ing our daugh­ter home for a family re­u­nion, and to tour the Bo­ra­cay is­lands since my hus­band has never been there,” said Mrs Chuang, 26, a house­wife.</p>
    <p>With over­seas travel this year look­ing un­likely to hap­pen, she is among a num­ber of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents who are con­sid­er­ing stay­ca­tions in­stead.</p>
    <p>A nine-month cam­paign was launched yesterday to en­cour­age lo­cals like the Chuang family to chan­nel some of their un­used travel bud­gets to­wards lo­cal busi­nesses, many of which are strug­gling to sur­vive amid the down­turn and tourist ban.</p>
    <p>The idea ap­peals to Mrs Chuang, who said costs are a con­cern given the economic cli­mate and prospect of higher house­hold ex­penses, es­pe­cially with a baby.</p>
    <p>“It’ll be our first real family va­ca­tion. As long as we can get a stay­ca­tion deal that’s rea­son­ably priced, we can spend qual­ity time to­gether,” she said.</p>
    <p>Tourism busi­nesses and in­dus­try ob­servers agreed that the cam­paign is a life­line for lo­cal firms, but said it may not be enough to sus­tain many if travel re­stric­tions do not ease soon.</p>
    <p>Mr David Lim, who man­ages three leisure at­trac­tions – trampoline park Bounce Sin­ga­pore, vir­tual re­al­ity ar­cade Zero La­tency and tree­top ob­sta­cle course For­est Ad­ven­ture – re­opened all of them ear­lier this month after get­ting ap­proval from the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>But the ca­pac­ity limit of 25 per cent is not enough for his busi­ness to break even de­spite promis­ing vis­i­tor num­bers, he said.</p>
    <p>“As a busi­ness op­er­a­tor, it’s al­ways painful to turn peo­ple away,” said Mr Lim, who noted that run­ning dis­counts and pro­mo­tions is also a chal­lenge given this lim­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Lo­cals made up about half of vis­i­tors to his at­trac­tions prior to the pan­demic, and many came in groups, which are now lim­ited to five mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Lim said he un­der­stands the need for strict safety mea­sures, and be­lieves build­ing con­fi­dence is more im­por­tant to get lo­cals to step out than of­fer­ing dis­counts.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong Soon-Hwa, chair­man of the Pa­cific Asia Travel As­so­ci­a­tion’s Sin­ga­pore Chap­ter, said there is cause for op­ti­mism, even if do­mes­tic spend­ing is not enough to sus­tain busi­nesses in the long run.</p>
    <p>“So as long as peo­ple get out there and do it safely, it counts,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to give busi­nesses some hope.”</p>
    <p>While tourism con­trib­utes only about 4 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, Mr Wong pointed out that it is part of a much larger ecosys­tem. “Peo­ple think of tourism as leisure, dis­cre­tionary. But it is part of busi­ness and global trade,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Pei Ling, 24, said hopes of go­ing on a grad­u­a­tion trip with her boyfriend be­fore start­ing work this month were dashed by the pan­demic. “I will be will­ing to spend more on lux­ury stay­ca­tions, given the to­tal cost would not be as much as a proper hol­i­day,” said Ms Tan, who works in fi­nance.</p>
    <p>While lo­cal tour pack­ages do not ap­peal to her as she is al­ready fa­mil­iar with many ar­eas of Sin­ga­pore, some of the dis­counted pack­ages be­ing pro­moted by the cam­paign do.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t been to the Night Sa­fari in ages, and I’ve never been to iFly be­fore – so the prospect of vis­it­ing th­ese places with my friends seems fun and ex­cit­ing,” she said.</p>
