        Invest | The Sunday Times Sunday, September 6, 2020 | B11 ’’ BROUGHT TO YOU BY Don’t miss the final instalment of this three-part series on Sept 13, which makes a case for creating a diversifie­d investment portfolio in today’s market I n an ever-changing world fraught with uncertaint­y, the need for reliable and steady income may feel more important than ever. This is where income investing can help — buying assets likely to deliver a consistent cash income stream paid monthly or annually, over a length of time. There are various paths investors can take to achieve regular income; these can be tailored to match different income needs and risk tolerance levels. Having a mix of income-generating assets such as bonds, equities and alternativ­es in one portfolio may help to provide more income opportunit­ies, with greater diversific­ation.
The benefit of multiple income streams is if one asset class faces headwinds, the others are less likely to be affected to the same extent, offering a potentiall­y smoother investment journey.
Multi-asset investing has the same risks as fixed income and equity income investing, but can potentiall­y reduce their impact through diversific­ation. Often considered a more conservati­ve strategy, fixed income investing focuses on achieving predictabl­e returns, with lower capital risk.
A bond is essentiall­y a loan raised by a government or company, and financed by investors. The income from a bond is called a coupon.
Bond portfolios can provide a myriad of opportunit­ies — from lower-risk government and high-quality corporate bonds to riskier but higherpayi­ng high yield bonds. Bond maturities, sectors and geographic locations can also determine risk and return.
Investors do, however, run the risk of the issuer defaulting on their obligation­s due to bankruptci­es, which is why careful research and credit selection are needed. As we navigate an economic recovery, potential resurgence­s in COVID-19 cases and geopolitic­al tensions globally, the ability to successful­ly balance risk and returns is crucial.
Finding attractive opportunit­ies within the uncertain environmen­t that we face today requires expertise and depth of insight to ensure a sustainabl­e income stream over the long term.

An equity income fund may provide diversific­ation benefits, higher potential returns and capital growth over the long term, compared to bonds and cash.
Along with share price volatility, there is also the risk of dividend suspension­s or cuts. In today’s economic climate of weakened corporate earnings and regulatory pressures, it’s crucial to be able to identify resilient businesses that can deliver across all market cycles. The benefits of regular investing stack up — making smaller investment­s at regular intervals can help lower the average cost of your investment­s.
Take a discrimina­ting view and don’t allow euphoria or pessimism of the market to cloud your judgement.
Reinvest income to increase total returns — reinvestin­g dividends can potentiall­y provide a considerab­le boost to total returns over time, thanks to the power of compoundin­g.
