    <p>They say sen­ti­ment against them is ris­ing as re­trench­ment goes up</p>
    <p>More ex­pa­tri­ates are mov­ing away from Sin­ga­pore’s prime, cen­tral dis­tricts and towards sub­ur­ban, heart­land ar­eas – while still opt­ing for pri­vate hous­ing within pre-ex­ist­ing ex­pat com­mu­ni­ties, ac­cord­ing to prop­erty agents and on­line por­tals that In­sight spoke to.</p>
    <p>They say the trend, anec­do­tally ob­served over the past decade, can be pri­mar­ily at­trib­uted to re­duced – if not en­tirely re­moved – ex­pat ben­e­fits, the re­lo­ca­tion of in­ter­na­tional schools and the im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate con­sul­tancy Knight Frank as­so­ci­ate ex­ec­u­tive sales di­rec­tor Ella Sher­man re­calls that big ex­pat pack­ages were the norm when she started out 14 years ago.</p>
    <p>“In­com­ing ex­pats had hous­ing al­lowances that let them live in ex­pen­sive con­dos and houses in prime dis­tricts. They also of­ten used to re­ceive club mem­ber­ships through their com­pa­nies – Amer­i­can Club, Tan­glin Club – so they all wanted to live in the ar­eas around Ard­more, Or­chard and Bukit Timah, which came with very high rents,” she says. “But over time, there’s def­i­nitely been a huge shift in com­pa­nies no longer giv­ing out these club mem­ber­ships, while also slash­ing hous­ing al­lowances dra­mat­i­cally. They are now half or less (than) what they used to be.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish na­tional Fran­cis (not his real name) says that when he first moved to Sin­ga­pore in 2012, ex­pats were get­ting “ev­ery­thing” – with ac­com­mo­da­tion, school­ing and elec­tric­ity bills all paid for by their em­ploy­ers. “Now, ex­pat pack­ages are gone and peo­ple come here more as a life­style choice, since the cost of liv­ing is so ex­or­bi­tant com­pared to back home,” he says.</p>
    <p>Ms Sher­man, who spe­cialises in ex­pat hous­ing, says the in­ter­na­tional schools have played a more im­por­tant role in prompt­ing her clients to move out into the heart­land, where a Seran­goon con­do­minium might cost $5,000 a month to rent com­pared with $15,000 for an Ard­more prop­erty.</p>
    <p>“If you’re a fam­ily, you have to re­duce your rent to meet the in­ter­na­tional school fees which are hugely ex­pen­sive. Many ex­pats have three to four chil­dren, and I do come across clients who say by the time they pay these school fees and their rent, they’re not sav­ing money,” she says.</p>
    <p>An­nual tu­ition fees for in­ter­na­tional schools in Sin­ga­pore could go up to nearly $55,000, based on quick checks on the schools’ web­sites. In con­trast, for­eign­ers pay up to $21,000 to study at lo­cal schools (at the high­est pre-univer­sity level).</p>
    <p>It helps that the schools them­selves are re­lo­cat­ing around the is­land, with ex­pats fol­low­ing suit to live within walk­ing dis­tance of in­sti­tu­tions like the Sin­ga­pore Amer­i­can School in Wood­lands, Stam­ford Amer­i­can In­ter­na­tional School in Woodleigh, In­ter­na­tional French School in Ang Mo Kio, and the Cana­dian In­ter­na­tional School, which moved its Bukit Timah cam­pus to Jurong West.</p>
    <p>Ms Sher­man says, how­ever, that pan­demic-in­duced re­trench­ments, pay cuts and ris­ing school fees due to fall­ing class sizes are forc­ing sev­eral of her Aus­tralian and Amer­i­can clients to leave Sin­ga­pore. “The num­bers no longer made it worth­while be­ing away from fam­ily and friends back home, so they repa­tri­ated,” she says.</p>
    <p>PRI­VATE LIFE­STYLES</p>
    <p>Within the heart­land, pub­lic Hous­ing Board (HDB) flats, with their ameni­ties, ac­ces­si­bil­ity and con­ve­nience, would also ap­pear to be a good rental op­tion for ex­pats, says Dr Tan Tee Khoon, Sin­ga­pore coun­try man­ager of the Prop­er­tyGuru por­tal.</p>
    <p>But Ms Sher­man says her clients con­tinue to in­sist on pri­vate hous­ing, with just the odd ac­quain­tance choos­ing to rent an HDB flat to save money. The big­gest fac­tor, she ex­plains, is im­me­di­ate ac­cess to a swim­ming pool – os­ten­si­bly a must-have for ex­pats mov­ing to tropical Asian coun­tries.</p>
    <p>She adds that the vast majority of ex­pats ex­press a pref­er­ence for prop­er­ties al­ready oc­cu­pied by other ex­pat fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“It’s not so much an is­sue of not want­ing di­ver­sity, but more about their chil­dren go­ing to the same in­ter­na­tional schools, and hav­ing some­one to play with in the condo and sit with on the school bus,” she says. “The in­ter­na­tional school sys­tem is dif­fer­ent from the lo­cal school sys­tem – there’s more em­pha­sis on play time, games, sports, the arts, and be­ing more cre­ative and imag­i­na­tive.</p>
    <p>“So it helps when they’ve got like­minded fam­i­lies around, rather than (a lo­cal par­ent) whose child typ­i­cally at­tends af­ter-school aca­demic en­rich­ment classes and then prac­tises play­ing the pi­ano for two hours a day, rather than play­ing with friends and hav­ing swim­ming lessons to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sher­man, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent, says it is also about ex­pat ca­ma­raderie. “You’re away from your home coun­try, over­seas, hav­ing a new ex­pe­ri­ence, on an ad­ven­ture of sorts. Hav­ing all that in com­mon with your neigh­bours, that’s a draw.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “Oc­ca­sion­ally, I get a fam­ily that says they don’t want to be in an ex­pat area, be­cause they are in Sin­ga­pore for an au­then­tic Asian ex­pe­ri­ence. But these are rare.”</p>
    <p>Of the 15 ex­pats in­ter­viewed by In­sight, only three had ever ex­pe­ri­enced stay­ing in an HDB flat.</p>
    <p>Tom, who works in the ship­ping in­dus­try on a Per­son­alised Em­ploy­ment Pass, spent three of his 10 years in Sin­ga­pore liv­ing in a rented flat in Pung­gol.</p>
    <p>“I was per­ceived as the weird ‘ang moh’ liv­ing in the block,” he says, us­ing the Hokkien term for red hair, which col­lo­qui­ally refers to Cau­casians.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery time I opened my front door, I would see my neigh­bours op­po­site peer­ing round the cor­ner to see what I was up to, as if they were think­ing, ‘What’s he do­ing here?’ ”</p>
