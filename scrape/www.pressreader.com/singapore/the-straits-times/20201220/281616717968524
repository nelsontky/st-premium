    <p>South African doc­tors have re­marked that more pa­tients are younger and do not al­ways have other con­di­tions that am­plify the virus’ ef­fect, but are none­the­less suf­fer­ing from more se­vere forms of Covid-19. That “strongly sug­gests that the cur­rent sec­ond wave we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing is be­ing driven by this new vari­ant”, (Health Min­is­ter Zwelini) Mkhize added.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>A se­vere vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus has been de­tected in South Africa, which could ex­plain the rapid spread of a sec­ond wave that af­fects younger peo­ple, the health min­is­ter has said.</p>
    <p>Known as the 501.V2 Vari­ant, it was iden­ti­fied by South African re­searchers and de­tails have been sent to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, Mr Zwelini Mkhize said in a state­ment on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>A team, led by the Kwazu­luNatal Re­search In­no­va­tion and Se­quenc­ing Plat­form, has se­quenced hun­dreds of virus sam­ples since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­gan and “no­ticed that a par­tic­u­lar vari­ant has in­creas­ingly dom­i­nated the find­ings of the sam­ples col­lected in the past two months”, he added.</p>
    <p>South African doc­tors have re­marked that more pa­tients are younger and do not al­ways have other con­di­tions that am­plify the virus’ ef­fect, but are none­the­less suf­fer­ing from more se­vere forms of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>That “strongly sug­gests that the cur­rent sec­ond wave we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing is be­ing driven by this new vari­ant”, Mr Mkhize added.</p>
    <p>The re­search team, led by Pro­fes­sor Tulio de Oliveira, has shared its find­ings with the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity and alerted the au­thor­i­ties in Bri­tain, who have “stud­ied their own sam­ples and found that a sim­i­lar mu­ta­tion... was the vari­ant that was driv­ing their resur­gence in London”, he said.</p>
    <p>Vari­ants of the coro­n­avirus have reg­u­larly been iden­ti­fied and called to the at­ten­tion of global health of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The South African health min­is­ter re­it­er­ated that the most ef­fec­tive way to fight back is to prac­tise social dis­tanc­ing, wear face masks and reg­u­larly wash one’s hands.</p>
    <p>South Africa has been af­fected more by the coro­n­avirus than other coun­tries on the con­ti­nent and, up till Fri­day, had recorded 24,845 deaths and more than 900,000 cases among a pop­u­la­tion of al­most 60 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>More than 8,700 cases were de­tected there in the pre­vi­ous 24 hours, still well be­low the peak of around 12,000 a day seen in July.</p>
