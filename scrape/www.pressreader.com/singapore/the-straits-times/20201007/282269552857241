    <p>The Grade A of­fice leas­ing mar­ket pretty much ground to a halt dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and has re­mained in the dol­drums ever since, a report yes­ter­day noted.</p>
    <p>Rent for Cen­tral Business District space fell 5.1 per cent in the third quar­ter to $9.84 per sq ft a month amid the worst re­ces­sion on record.</p>
    <p>Ten­ants are also feel­ing the pinch, given the business un­cer­tainty, with those fac­ing im­me­di­ate lease ex­piry seek­ing short-term re­newals.</p>
    <p>There may be more pain to come as com­pa­nies are con­duct­ing stud­ies to de­ter­mine their fu­ture of­fice needs, with much of­fice space un­der­utilised while work­ing from home re­mains the de­fault dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“In the im­me­di­ate to short term, the mar­ket is ex­pect­ing a frac­tion of space to be re­turned va­cant when oc­cu­piers re­new their leases,” said the Cush­man & Wake­field (C&W) report.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, some va­cated spa­ces are be­ing taken up by other oc­cu­piers who are “seiz­ing the op­por­tu­nity to lease prime space at more at­trac­tive rental rates”, it added.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, QBE In­sur­ance is re­lo­cat­ing to Guoco Tower and tak­ing up 31,000 sq ft va­cated by Grab, which is mov­ing to one-north. And Ama­zon is leas­ing 90,000 sq ft across three floors at Asia Square Tower 1 that Citi is giv­ing up.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Lam­pard, C&W’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and head of Sin­ga­pore com­mer­cial leas­ing and re­gional ten­ant rep­re­sen­ta­tion, said that al­low­ing half of an or­gan­i­sa­tion’s work­force to re­turn to the of­fice is a game changer, as this gives com­pa­nies a “crit­i­cal mass” to as­sess their agility model.</p>
    <p>“Up to now, com­pa­nies were not pre­pared to make de­ci­sions as no one was in the of­fice. The mar­ket has taken the first step in the re­turn to liq­uid­ity, driven by com­pa­nies seek­ing smaller re­quire­ments and giv­ing up space,” he said.</p>
    <p>One pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment comes in the form of Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies ex­pand­ing in Sin­ga­pore due to geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions, the report said. For ex­am­ple, ByteDance plans to make Sin­ga­pore its re­gional hub for its ex­pan­sion into the rest of Asia and has ap­plied for a li­cence to op­er­ate a dig­i­tal bank here.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Ten­cent has cho­sen Sin­ga­pore as its re­gional hub and plans to open a new of­fice.</p>
    <p>An­other bright spot is the up­com­ing re­de­vel­op­ments of AXA Tower and Fuji Xerox Tower next year. This will dis­place about one mil­lion sq ft of of­fice space, C&W said.</p>
    <p>It es­ti­mates there have been 350,000 sq ft of new leases and ex­pan­sions in of­fice space by tech firms since the start of the year. C&W projects the take-up by tech firms to in­crease to be­tween 400,000 sq ft and 500,000 sq ft next year.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, the Sin­ga­pore of­fice mar­ket heads into the fourth quar­ter with “sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges”, it noted. In the short to medium term, the preva­lence of staff work­ing from home is ex­pected to re­main wide­spread. The of­fice sec­tor will also be re­shaped by the in­crease in the re­mote-work­ing trend ow­ing to struc­tural im­pacts, which will af­fect leas­ing de­mand in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, there has been a rise in re­trench­ments due to the re­ces­sion, with a num­ber of com­pa­nies such as banks giv­ing up space. Ac­cord­ingly, the full-year rental change is still pro­jected to tum­ble 10 per cent this year, with a fur­ther de­cline ex­pected next year, C&W said.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the down­ward pres­sure from the re­ces­sion and a pro­longed pe­riod of work­ing from home have re­sulted in a net re­duc­tion in of­fice take-up, Mr Lam­pard said.</p>
    <p>There may be more pain to come as com­pa­nies are con­duct­ing stud­ies to de­ter­mine their fu­ture of­fice needs, with much of­fice space un­der­utilised while work­ing from home re­mains the de­fault dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
