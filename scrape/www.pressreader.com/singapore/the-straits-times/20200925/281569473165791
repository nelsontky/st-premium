    <p>The ar­rival of coronaviru­s-in­fected pas­sen­gers on flights from In­dia re­mains a con­cern for other coun­tries at a time when the In­dian gov­ern­ment is at­tempt­ing to aug­ment in­ter­na­tional air traf­fic through bi­lat­eral travel bub­bles. This week, Saudi Arabia sus­pended air travel from In­dia amid con­cerns of po­ten­tial im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>The ar­rival of coronaviru­s-in­fected pas­sen­gers on flights from In­dia re­mains a con­cern for other coun­tries at a time when the In­dian gov­ern­ment is at­tempt­ing to aug­ment in­ter­na­tional air pas­sen­ger traf­fic through bi­lat­eral travel bub­bles.</p>
    <p>This week, Saudi Arabia, a key des­ti­na­tion for In­dian mi­grant work­ers, sus­pended air travel from In­dia amid con­cerns of po­ten­tial im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>This devel­op­ment comes af­ter two air­lines – Air In­dia and Air In­dia Ex­press – were handed tem­po­rary bans last week by the au­thor­i­ties in Hong Kong and Dubai for fly­ing in Covid-19 pos­i­tive pas­sen­gers to these two cities.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong barred Air In­dia for a fort­night un­til Oct 3, af­ter one of its flights to the city last Fri­day car­ried six in­fected pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond time the au­thor­i­ties in Hong Kong have banned Air In­dia. A sim­i­lar two-week sus­pen­sion or­der was handed out to the air­line last month, af­ter it flew 14 Covid-19 pos­i­tive pas­sen­gers to the city on Aug 11.</p>
    <p>Prior to this, Air In­dia Ex­press was is­sued a 15-day ban by the Dubai Civil Avi­a­tion Authority on Sept 17. This was be­cause the air­line’s ground-han­dling agents failed to pre­vent two pas­sen­gers with pos­i­tive Covid-19 re­ports from board­ing flights to Dubai – one from Delhi on Aug 28 and the other from Jaipur on Sept 4.</p>
    <p>The sus­pen­sion or­der was, how­ever, re­voked last Fri­day fol­low­ing an apol­ogy and as­sur­ance of better pre-board­ing checks, an Air In­dia Ex­press spokesman told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>In­dia has recorded over 5.7 mil­lion con­firmed Covid-19 cases, but sero­log­i­cal sur­veys, which de­tect an­ti­bod­ies to de­ter­mine ex­po­sure to the virus, show a far greater spread of the in­fec­tion that is yet to show any con­vinc­ing sign of hav­ing peaked.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, sev­eral coun­tries now re­quire vis­i­tors fly­ing in from In­dia to pro­duce a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test car­ried out within 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture cer­ti­fy­ing them to be neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong also re­quires vis­i­tors from In­dia to have a neg­a­tive “nu­cleic acid test” re­port con­ducted 72 hours prior to de­par­ture, along with proof that the test was con­ducted in a lab­o­ra­tory recog­nised by the lo­cal gov­ern­ment. Trav­ellers also must have a ho­tel room reser­va­tion in Hong Kong for not less than 14 days start­ing on the day of ar­rival.</p>
    <p>An Air In­dia spokesman told The Straits Times that the air­line has been “strictly ad­her­ing” to all pas­sen­ger screen­ing re­quire­ments for flights to in­ter­na­tional des­ti­na­tions and that, wher­ever re­quired, only pas­sen­gers with Covid-19-neg­a­tive re­ports are al­lowed on board.</p>
    <p>He said pas­sen­gers are tested again for Covid-19 af­ter land­ing in Hong Kong and the re­sults “may vary from the re­ports of tests con­ducted 72 hours be­fore tak­ing the flight”. Hence, Air In­dia can­not be held re­spon­si­ble for any dis­crep­an­cies in pas­sen­gers’ test re­ports, he added.</p>
    <p>The In­dian gov­ern­ment has a travel bub­ble ar­range­ment with 13 coun­tries to al­low smoother in­ter­na­tional air pas­sen­ger traf­fic.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar sched­uled com­mer­cial flights have been sus­pended in In­dia since March 25.</p>
    <p>In­dia has recorded over</p>
    <p>5.7 mil­lion con­firmed Covid-19 cases, but sero­log­i­cal sur­veys... show a far greater spread of the in­fec­tion that is yet to show any con­vinc­ing sign of hav­ing peaked.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, sev­eral coun­tries now re­quire vis­i­tors fly­ing in from In­dia to pro­duce a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test car­ried out within 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture cer­ti­fy­ing them to be neg­a­tive.</p>
