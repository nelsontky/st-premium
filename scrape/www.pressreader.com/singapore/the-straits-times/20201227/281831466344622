    <p>The labour au­thor­i­ties of Tai­wan and In­done­sia have failed to reach an agree­ment over the re­cruit­ment costs for In­done­sians mov­ing to Tai­wan to work as maids and care­givers.</p>
    <p>The two sides held a vir­tual meet­ing last Wed­nes­day to dis­cuss a new pol­icy which the Indonesian govern­ment an­nounced in July.</p>
    <p>From Jan 15 next year, Indonesian work­ers in 10 sec­tors, in­clud­ing do­mes­tic work, will be ex­empted from paying place­ment fees to re­cruit­ment agen­cies in the coun­try and that of their place of em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>For em­ploy­ers in Tai­wan, this means they will have to pay the re­cruit­ment and train­ing fees of their Indonesian hires.</p>
    <p>The Indonesian of­fi­cials said the new pol­icy will ap­ply to 14 coun­tries or ter­ri­to­ries, in­clud­ing Tai­wan, that em­ploy In­done­sians.</p>
    <p>As of last month, there were 265,439 Indonesian mi­grant work­ers in Tai­wan. Among them, 194,022 were em­ployed as care­givers and maids.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Tai­wan’s Min­istry of Labour figures, about 77 per cent of for­eign­ers hired as maids and care­givers last year were In­done­sians.</p>
    <p>“It looks like our govern­ment couldn’t per­suade (the Indonesian govern­ment), so that would mean em­ploy­ers here would have to pay at least an ad­di­tional NT$70,000 or NT$80,000 (S$3,300 or S$3,800),” said Ms Yeh Hsue­hfang, who has been re­cruit­ing mi­grant work­ers for a labour agency in the cap­i­tal Taipei for at least 20 years.</p>
    <p>She said about two-thirds of the sum will be paid to agen­cies in In­done­sia who train the mi­grant work­ers and put up the nec­es­sary doc­u­ments for them to move to Tai­wan as do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, an em­ployer in Tai­wan needs to pay NT$10,500 to the lo­cal labour agency when hir­ing a do­mes­tic worker. It cov­ers the two-week manda­tory quar­an­tine that all trav­ellers to Tai­wan are re­quired to un­dergo, as well as a Covid-19 test at the end of the quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic helpers re­ceive roughly NT$20,000 per month as their salary, af­ter paying their dues to the Tai­wanese agen­cies.</p>
    <p>“We’re suf­fer­ing from a real worker short­age in Tai­wan; most fam­i­lies are un­will­ing to let go of their Indonesian do­mes­tic worker once they man­age to hire one.</p>
    <p>“Indonesian work­ers are in high de­mand be­cause Tai­wanese em­ploy­ers be­lieve they are more obe­di­ent than Filipino or Viet­namese work­ers,” said Ms Yeh.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin Chen Yueh-li, 89, said she will not pay the Tai­wanese bro­kers the ex­tra money.</p>
    <p>“All they did was bring a new care­giver to me,” said Ms Lin Chen, who lives alone. She has em­ployed mi­grant work­ers to look af­ter her for more than 20 years.</p>
    <p>“But I do pre­fer Indonesian work­ers, they are more ‘guai’ (obe­di­ent),” she added in Mandarin.</p>
    <p>Deputy Min­is­ter of Labour Lin San-quei said the Indonesian of­fi­cials ex­plained that the “zero place­ment fee” pol­icy ap­plies to “do­mes­tic work­ers only, specif­i­cally the newly hired ones (ar­riv­ing in Tai­wan)”.</p>
    <p>He added: “We’ve ex­pressed clearly that we hope the pol­icy can be post­poned till is­sues and pay­ments are clar­i­fied.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lin said the Indonesian govern­ment wants em­ploy­ers in Tai­wan to cover costs which in­clude plane tick­ets, visa fees, train­ing classes, so­cial in­sur­ance and bro­ker fees. More de­tails are ex­pected af­ter a fol­low-up meet­ing in two weeks’ time, he added.</p>
    <p>Ms An­nie Hong, who works as a re­cruiter at Chino Hu­man Re­sources, a mi­grant do­mes­tic worker agency in Taipei, said: “It looks like Tai­wan can­not re­ject this pol­icy be­cause the Indonesian govern­ment is very adamant about im­ple­ment­ing it.</p>
    <p>“I would sug­gest peo­ple look­ing to hire a do­mes­tic worker now ap­ply for one from the Philip­pines.”</p>
    <p>She added: “If Tai­wan re­fuses In­done­sia’s de­mands, then they would just stop send­ing work­ers to Tai­wan.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ms Chen Hsiu-lien, a re­searcher for the Tai­wan In­ter­na­tional Work­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion, said: “We shouldn’t be ask­ing the mi­grant work­ers to shoul­der these fees alone in the first place.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chen sup­ports the new pol­icy and points out that peo­ple should fo­cus on where the money is ac­tu­ally go­ing to.</p>
    <p>“More of­ten than not, bro­ker agen­cies on both sides ask for more money than nec­es­sary. I think for the Tai­wanese side, we need the agen­cies to list what they are do­ing with the fees,” she said.</p>
