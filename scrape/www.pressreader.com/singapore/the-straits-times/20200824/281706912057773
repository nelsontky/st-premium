    <p>Tucked away in a base­ment at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH) is a ware­house that stores more than 2,600 types of med­i­cal sup­plies and gowns for health­care staff and pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The less vis­i­ble ma­te­ri­als man­age­ment de­part­ment has been more busy over the past seven months, de­liv­er­ing trol­ley loads of sup­plies to clin­ics and wards daily, and man­ag­ing sup­ply chain shocks.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of pieces of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment were used by the hos­pi­tal each day dur­ing the peak of the pan­demic, al­most three times their nor­mal us­age rate, said Mr Kenny Tang, 46, head of the de­part­ment.</p>
    <p>While grap­pling with higher de­mand, the de­part­ment had to deal with ex­port lim­i­ta­tions as its sup­pli­ers abroad had to save re­sources for the use of their own coun­tries.</p>
    <p>To avoid a hos­pi­tal-wide short­age of sup­plies, the team had to di­ver­sify their sourc­ing and also reach out to non-tra­di­tional sources such as a lo­cal cor­po­rate gift ven­dor, which helped the de­part­ment ob­tain face shields from China.</p>
    <p>With sup­ply un­cer­tainty, price in­creases for cru­cial items such as dis­pos­able pil­low cov­ers, ban­dages, dress­ing and al­co­hol swabs were un­avoid­able, said Mr Tang.</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing more or­der re­quests from wards and mak­ing daily trips to more than 30 lo­ca­tions in the hos­pi­tal be­came the norm for the de­part­ment’s store­keep­ers. Pre­vi­ously, they re­plen­ished sup­plies a few times a week.</p>
    <p>Many of the 10 store­keep­ers are long-serv­ing staff, and half of them are aged be­tween 50 and 68. For each de­liv­ery, they had to lug heaps of heavy and bulky med­i­cal items on trol­leys across the Kent Ridge grounds. “Lever­ag­ing tech­nol­ogy is our big­gest chal­lenge, and it is still a man­ual process,” said Mr Tang.</p>
    <p>But from this week­end, the store­keep­ers’ work­load will be re­duced by 20 per cent as the de­part­ment switches to an elec­tronic sys­tem to alert the team when sup­ply in wards are run­ning low. Mr Tang added: “Al­though we tend to be in­vis­i­ble, I al­ways tell my team the role we play is mean­ing­ful be­cause we fill the hands that heal.”</p>
