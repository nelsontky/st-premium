    <p>Nom­i­na­tions for the Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) polls closed on Tues­day with an eleventh-hour sur­prise when for­mer na­tional sprinter U. K. Shyam de­cided not to con­test the Sept 25 elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Shyam, who holds the na­tional men’s 100m record of 10.37sec, was on Sept 6 an­nounced as part of the TeamSGP Ath­let­ics line-up led by lawyer Ed­mond Pereira.</p>
    <p>But the team said in a press state­ment yes­ter­day that Shyam, who was slated to run for a com­mit­tee mem­ber post, would be re­placed by Fahmy Raimi, the chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer of dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing firm</p>
    <p>RAWR Global.</p>
    <p>Shyam, 44, told The Straits Times he will not be run­ning for of­fice due to heavy work com­mit­ments. The se­nior man­ager at Sport Sin­ga­pore said he “will be sup­port­ing the team in their ath­lete devel­op­ment com­mit­tee” in­stead.</p>
    <p>He and Chan Mun Wei, founder of so­cial en­ter­prise Sus­tain­ableSG and a for­mer di­rec­tor of sports at the then Min­istry of Com­mu­nity Devel­op­ment, Youth and Sports, will sup­port Pereira’s nine-mem­ber team through its var­i­ous com­mit­tees.</p>
    <p>TeamSGP Ath­let­ics will face the team led by Go­jek gen­eral man­ager Lien Choong Luen at the Sept 25 an­nual gen­eral meet­ing.</p>
    <p>In­cum­bent pres­i­dent Tang Weng</p>
    <p>Fei will not be stand­ing for re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Pereira, 70, said: “We have a di­verse team with pro­fes­sion­als with skill sets which are nec­es­sary for the devel­op­ment of track and field in Sin­ga­pore and to move the sport to greater heights.”</p>
    <p>Other mem­bers of the team in­clude swim­ming leg­end Ang Peng Siong and lawyer S. Govin­daraju, who are cur­rently SA’s vice-pres­i­dents of train­ing and se­lec­tion, and com­pe­ti­tions or­gan­is­ing, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Fahmy said he will fo­cus on digi­tis­ing the as­so­ci­a­tion’s ser­vices, adding that “en­hance­ment of so­cial en­gage­ment will also help open new doors and op­por­tu­ni­ties”.</p>
    <p>TeamSGP Ath­let­ics also an­nounced its goal of rais­ing up to $1 mil­lion in spon­sor­ship for SA, and that it would be pro­vid­ing fis­cal sup­port to the in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing (IHLs) to or­gan­ise the In­sti­tute-Var­sity-Polytech­nic track and field meet.</p>
    <p>Lien’s Team Ground Up fea­ture Gary Yeo, a for­mer SA ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive who re­signed from his role in March.</p>
    <p>He will run for the post of vicepres­i­dent (train­ing and se­lec­tion). The other vice-pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates are vet­eran of­fi­cial Joe Yap (com­pe­ti­tions or­gan­is­ing) and DBS data an­a­lyst Marinda Teo (fi­nance and part­ner­ship).</p>
    <p>The team an­nounced ear­lier this month that they have se­cured $100,000 in do­na­tions to get their plans go­ing if they are voted into power.</p>
    <p>These in­clude turn­ing IHLs into re­gional train­ing cen­tres and pro­vid­ing coaches for ath­letes from schools that do not fo­cus on ath­let­ics, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Next week’s AGM at Nexus Au­di­to­rium, Cup­page Plaza, will see SA’s 23 af­fil­i­ate mem­bers vot­ing in nine out of the 18-strong field to the man­age­ment com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>There will be two non-elected mem­bers of the com­mit­tee: The ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and an ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive.</p>
