    <p>MO­SUL (NC16, 101 min­utes, opens to­day)</p>
    <p>A few years ago, an Iraqi spe­cial forces team roamed the coun­try’s se­cond most pop­u­lous city, Mo­sul, parts of which had fallen to the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria. Their ex­tra­or­di­nary feats be­hind en­emy lines – of­ten act­ing be­yond the con­trol of the gov­ern­ment – were cap­tured in a 2017 New Yorker mag­a­zine ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>That piece has been adapted into a vivid, ar­rest­ing movie, one that de­picts sol­diers not just do­ing their jobs, but do­ing it in a city in the grip of mad­ness.</p>
    <p>The story is seen through the eyes of fresh re­cruit Kawa (French-Tu­nisian ac­tor Adam Bessa). Through him, the au­di­ence learns the ABCs: who the mem­bers of the Nin­eveh Swat team are and why they have cho­sen to make a stand when reg­u­lar Iraqi troops have fled. Kawa’s new bud­dies fight be­cause the fight is per­sonal. They are set­tling scores.</p>
    <p>In a move rarely seen in com­mer­cial film-mak­ing, the largely Amer­i­can pro­duc­tion team used a cast of ac­tors of Mid­dle Eastern or North African de­scent who speak Ara­bic. The mil­i­tary ac­tion is also re­al­is­tic – in the heat of bat­tle, for in­stance, good guys kill one an­other by mis­take.</p>
    <p>Be­cause this is a story about rene­gades, and non-Amer­i­cans at that, writer-di­rec­tor Matthew Car­na­han is free to show the Swat team do­ing what the mak­ers of, say, Black Hawk Down (2001) or Amer­i­can Sniper (2014) can­not. These fight­ers per­form deeds that are, at best, morally am­bigu­ous, at worst, could have them tried for war crimes.</p>
    <p>Be­cause Car­na­han’s fight­ers are driven by sim­ple rage, the bat­tle scenes are a cathar­tic watch, free of the groan-in­duc­ing higher-pur­pose, save-the-puppy mo­ti­va­tions that fill out too many war movies.</p>
    <p>The naive Kawa has a role sim­i­lar to that of Emily Blunt’s wide-eyed Agent Mercer in an­other movie in which the hands of the he­roes are as blood-stained as those of the vil­lains: the drug-war film Si­cario (2015).</p>
    <p>Rather than tak­ing aim at how war with­out lim­its eats away at the soul, Mo­sul in­stead puts a fo­cus on blood-pump­ing room-by-room, street-by-street bat­tles. That fo­cus, bol­stered by big-bud­get set de­sign, cin­e­matog­ra­phy and edit­ing, makes this one of the most ex­cit­ing and in­ter­est­ing works of ac­tion cin­ema in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>SUM­MER­LAND</p>
    <p>(R21, 100 min­utes, opens to­day)</p>
    <p>Eng­land is in the grip of World War II. Gemma Arter­ton is Al­ice Lamb, a loner who hides her cranky self in a cot­tage set on a cliff some dis­tance from the vil­lage, where some think of her as a Nazi spy.</p>
    <p>She is a writer, a pub­lished aca­demic spe­cial­is­ing in folk­lore – or to be more spe­cific, a myth-buster, a Scrooge-like re­searcher ob­sessed with ex­pos­ing tra­di­tional tales as com­fort­ing lies.</p>
    <p>Al­ice will trans­form her think­ing by the film’s end, of course. The cat­a­lyst ar­rives in the form of a boy, Frank (Lu­cas Bond), one of the thou­sands of young evac­uees sent from Lon­don to the coun­try, away from Ger­man bombs. The town of­fi­cial, Sul­li­van (Tom Courte­nay), forces him into</p>
    <p>Al­ice’s care. The child and the child-hat­ing recluse make each other mis­er­able.</p>
    <p>Get­ting from here to in­evitable heart-warm­ing res­o­lu­tion in­volves ma­jor dis­cov­er­ies and changes of heart.</p>
    <p>There are plot con­trivances here that ask a lot of the viewer, but none are sold with much con­vic­tion. Al­ice’s grumpi­ness is more the re­sult of a mis­un­der­stand­ing than ac­tual mal­ice on her part, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>The perky boy and the crusty aca­demic find com­mon ground with facile ease. The mid-film ap­pear­ance of Vera (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a fig­ure from</p>
    <p>Al­ice’s past, makes Al­ice’s redemp­tion all but as­sured.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish play­wright and film-maker Jes­sica Swale wrote and di­rected this work, suf­fused with the sort of gen­tle hu­mour and low-key tragedy that some might con­sider clas­sic English com­fort view­ing, oth­ers as safe and for­get­table.</p>
    <p>Credit should be given to the film’s dis­trib­u­tor Shaw Or­gan­i­sa­tion for keep­ing the les­bian kiss that earns this work an R21 clas­si­fi­ca­tion, but oth­er­wise there is lit­tle to rec­om­mend here.</p>
    <p>SYNCHRONIC</p>
    <p>(NC16, 102 min­utes, opens to­day)</p>
    <p>In sci­ence-fic­tion movies, time travel is a tool used for won­der­ment, thrills and redemp­tion. In 2017’s The End­less, Justin Ben­son and Aaron Moor­head, work­ing as co-di­rec­tors (with Ben­son pen­ning the screen­play), made time travel a source of hor­ror. It was a fes­ti­val hit.</p>
    <p>As hap­pens with those who break out at fes­ti­vals, Ben­son and Moor­head were asked if they had any­thing sim­i­lar in their bag and in­stead of cast­ing them­selves in the lead roles, they would get to cast stars.</p>
    <p>En­ter Jamie Dornan and An­thony Mackie, two New Orleans paramedics deal­ing with a new street drug of the film’s ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The first part of the movie con­cerns it­self with scene-set­ting.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous per­sons swal­low the drug and take a trip, lit­er­ally.</p>
    <p>These jour­neys of­ten end in blood, be­cause the past is not just a vi­o­lent place, it is hos­tile to the sud­den ap­pear­ance of oddly dressed strangers.</p>
    <p>Some­thing hap­pens to make the mat­ter of the time-trav­el­ling pill a per­sonal is­sue for the men. While it be­comes im­me­di­ately ob­vi­ous what needs to be done to solve the prob­lem, the char­ac­ters take an aw­fully long time to ar­rive at the same con­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>There is a pa­tience-test­ing amount of head-scratch­ing be­fore the men know what the au­di­ence al­ready knows. When that hap­pens the film fi­nally quick­ens its pace, but that takes care of only some of the film’s is­sues.</p>
    <p>The vil­lain in this drama is Amer­ica’s vi­o­lent his­tory. New Orleans in the Ice Age, or in the time of the Span­ish con­quest, or in the age of slav­ery or Civil War is not where tourists from the 21st cen­tury ought to make a stop.</p>
    <p>In these scenes, there is a fine line be­tween un­in­ten­tional fish-out-of-wa­ter com­edy and drama.</p>
    <p>Ben­son and Moor­head barely hold the line here and use vi­o­lence as the way out of that creative prob­lem - thank­fully, it works, most of the time.</p>
    <p>SUMIKKOGUR­ASHI</p>
    <p>(G, 66 min­utes, opens to­day, not re­viewed)</p>
    <p>The cute crea­tures that form the world cre­ated by de­signer Yuri Yokomizo, pre­vi­ously seen as mo­tifs on prod­ucts and as plush toys, now have a movie, one that was a box-of­fice smash when re­leased in Ja­pan last year.</p>
    <p>The char­ac­ters are in their usual cafe when they find a mag­i­cal book that trans­ports them into the world of clas­sic chil­dren’s sto­ries.</p>
