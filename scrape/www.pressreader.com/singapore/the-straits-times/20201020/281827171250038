    <p>KARACHI • Tens of thou­sands of op­po­si­tion sup­port­ers ral­lied in Pakistan’s largest city of Karachi as part of a campaign to oust Prime Min­is­ter Im­ran Khan, who they ac­cuse of be­ing in­stalled by the mil­i­tary in a rigged election two years ago.</p>
    <p>The mass demon­stra­tion on Sun­day in Karachi was the se­cond in three days launched by the Pakistan Demo­cratic Move­ment, formed last month by nine ma­jor op­po­si­tion par­ties to be­gin a na­tion­wide ag­i­ta­tion against the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Khan, Pakistan has ex­pe­ri­enced mount­ing cen­sor­ship of the me­dia and a crack­down on dis­sent, crit­ics and op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>But the campaign against him sought to tap into dis­con­tent over his han­dling of the econ­omy, which was tank­ing even be­fore the global coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>“You’ve snatched jobs from people. You have snatched... food from the people,” Ms Maryam Nawaz, the daugh­ter and po­lit­i­cal heir of the former three-time pre­mier Nawaz Sharif, said at the rally, re­fer­ring to Mr Khan.</p>
    <p>In the early hours of yes­ter­day, po­lice ar­rested her hus­band Muham­mad Saf­dar fol­low­ing com­plaints from Mr Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-In­saaf party that he had raised po­lit­i­cal slo­gans at the mau­soleum of Pakistan’s founder Muham­mad Ali Jin­nah, an ac­tion deemed il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>“Po­lice broke my room door at the ho­tel I was stay­ing at in Karachi and ar­rested Capt Saf­dar,” Ms Nawaz tweeted yes­ter­day morn­ing. A spokesman for the pro­vin­cial gov­ern­ment said po­lice had not acted on its orders.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Sun­day’s rally, Ms Nawaz had shared the plat­form with Mr Bi­lawal Bhutto Zar­dari, whose late mother Be­nazir Bhutto served twice as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“Our farm­ers have hunger in their homes... our youth is dis­ap­pointed,” said Mr Zar­dari, whose Pakistan People’s Party gov­erns Karachi.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage struck a chord with their sup­port­ers, in a coun­try now suf­fer­ing dou­ble-digit in­fla­tion and neg­a­tive eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>“In­fla­tion has bro­ken the back of poor cit­i­zens forc­ing many to beg to feed their chil­dren,” said Mr Faqeer Baloch, 63, at the Karachi rally.</p>
    <p>“It is high time that this gov­ern­ment should go now,” he said as the crowd chanted, “Go Im­ran go!”</p>
    <p>The next gen­eral election sched­uled for 2023.</p>
