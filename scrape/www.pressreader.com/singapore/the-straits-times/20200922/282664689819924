    <p>NEW YORK • Amer­i­can writer Win­ston Groom (left), who found a mea­sure of be­lated celebrity when his 1986 novel, For­rest Gump, was made into the 1994 Os­car-win­ning film star­ring Tom Hanks, died last Thurs­day at his home in Fairhope, Alabama. He was 77.</p>
    <p>He died in his sleep, most likely from a heart at­tack, his step­son Fred­er­ick Helm­s­ing said.</p>
    <p>Groom had pub­lished three well-re­garded nov­els and was a Pulitzer Prize non-fic­tion fi­nal­ist. But it was For­rest Gump that would de­fine him as a writer and turn the Gumpian phrase “life is like a box of choco­lates” into a mod­ern-day proverb.</p>
    <p>The novel tells the pi­caresque ad­ven­tures of an Alabama man who stum­bles through con­tem­po­rary Amer­i­can his­tory with an IQ of 70 and a head­ful of folksy wis­dom. The novel sold re­spectably and earned good re­views.</p>
    <p>But when For­rest Gump was made into a film by Para­mount Pic­tures, it be­came a cul­tural phe­nom­e­non. For­rest Gump be­came, like Huck­le­berry Finn and At­ti­cus Finch, to name two other fic­tional Amer­i­can South­ern­ers, a beloved Amer­i­can char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>His koan-like say­ings – “stupid is as stupid does” and the line about choco­lates (nei­ther of which ap­peared as such in the novel) – en­tered the lex­i­con as “Gump­isms”. The movie’s pop­u­lar­ity even led to the found­ing of an Amer­i­can seafood restau­rant chain, Bubba Gump Shrimp, in­spired by a char­ac­ter who hopes to start a shrimp­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The 1994 film grossed more than US$670 mil­lion glob­ally at the box of­fice, earned 13 Academy Award nom­i­na­tions and won six Os­cars, in­clud­ing for Best Pic­ture.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic­ity made Groom’s novel a best­seller long af­ter the fact, and it prompted him to write a se­quel, Gump & Co., pub­lished in 1995.</p>
    <p>Groom was mar­ried three times. In ad­di­tion to his step­son, he is sur­vived by his wife, Su­san Groom; a daugh­ter, Carolina Groom; and two other stepchil­dren, Guy Helm­s­ing and Mar­garet Brown­ing.</p>
    <p>“For­rest Gump is not the only rea­son to cel­e­brate him as a great writer,” P.J. O’Rourke, the po­lit­i­cal satirist and jour­nal­ist who knew Groom for decades, wrote in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>In Mr O’Rourke’s view, Groom’s de­but novel, Bet­ter Times Than These (1978), “was the best novel writ­ten about the Viet­nam War”.</p>
    <p>“And this is not even to men­tion Win­ston’s ex­tra­or­di­nary his­tor­i­cal and non-fic­tion works,” he added.</p>
    <p>Those books in­clude the Pulitzer Prize fi­nal­ist (for gen­eral non-fic­tion), Con­ver­sa­tions With The En­emy (1983), an ac­count of a Viet­nam-era pris­oner of war writ­ten with Dun­can Spencer; Shrouds Of Glory (1995), about the United States Civil War; and Pa­tri­otic Fire (2006), about the Bat­tle of New Or­leans.</p>
