    <p>OR­LANDO • Af­ter watch­ing his wing­man Khris Mid­dle­ton av­er­age 2.4 points per quar­ter in the Mil­wau­kee Bucks’ Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) East­ern Con­fer­ence play-offs against the Or­lando Magic, Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo asked the for­ward to step up.</p>
    <p>Mid­dle­ton re­sponded in the fourth quar­ter of Game 4 on Monday with 18 points on 60 per cent shoot­ing – up from the 28 per cent he was av­er­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>The Bucks’ late dom­i­nance sealed a 121-106 vic­tory and gave them a 3-1 lead in the first-round se­ries.</p>
    <p>“At times I am too un­selfish, so I have to force the is­sue,” said Mid­dle­ton, who got his team­mate’s mes­sage to “shoot un­til your arms fall off” when their lead was cut to 84-81, and fin­ished with 21 points.</p>
    <p>“Gian­nis told me just be ag­gres­sive and that is what I tried to do.”</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo paced Mil­wau­kee, own­ers of the best record in the reg­u­lar sea­son (56-17), with 31 points at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Com­plex near Or­lando.</p>
    <p>The reign­ing NBA Most Valu­able Player also had 15 re­bounds and eight as­sists for the Bucks, who are try­ing to win their sec­ond NBA ti­tle since 1971.</p>
    <p>The un­der­dogs Magic, who stunned the Bucks in Game 1, kept it close through three quar­ters un­til Mil­wau­kee erupted for an 18-3 scor­ing run to seize con­trol.</p>
    <p>Or­lando re­sponded with a run of their own to trim the deficit to seven points with 4min 2sec re­main­ing, but could get no closer.</p>
    <p>The Magic, still with­out key con­trib­u­tors Aaron Gor­don, Jonathan Isaac and Mo Bamba, were led by Nikola Vuce­vic’s 31 points, 11 re­bounds and seven as­sists. Markelle</p>
    <p>Fultz added 15 points.</p>
    <p>“To start the fourth we went through a dry spell of­fen­sively and we didn’t ex­e­cute well,” Vuce­vic said. “It’s tough when you play well for three quar­ters. You have to be able to ex­e­cute and make shots and we didn’t.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Philadel­phia 76ers on Monday fired head coach Brett Brown, just one day af­ter the team were swept out of the play­offs by the Bos­ton Celtics.</p>
    <p>Brown com­piled a 221-344 record in seven sea­sons at the helm and took them to the post-sea­son in each of the last three sea­sons.</p>
    <p>“He did many pos­i­tive things dur­ing his time here,” said 76ers gen­eral man­ager El­ton Brand.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, we fell well short of our goals this year and I be­lieve it is best to go in a new di­rec­tion.”</p>
