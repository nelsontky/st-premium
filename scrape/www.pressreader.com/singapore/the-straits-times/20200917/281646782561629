    <p>Tourist at­trac­tions will be able to cater to more vis­i­tors, after more than two months of be­ing re­stricted to fill­ing just 25 per cent of op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity at any one time.</p>
    <p>From to­mor­row, they can ap­ply to the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) to in­crease this to 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>They can also seek per­mis­sion to scale up the ca­pac­ity at their out­door shows to 250 peo­ple, up from 50 cur­rently. But shows must be split into five zones with a max­i­mum of 50 peo­ple in each zone and safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween groups as well as zones.</p>
    <p>This means the limit for their out­door shows will be in line with the max­i­mum num­ber of par­tic­i­pants soon to be al­lowed at ap­proved Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions) events.</p>
    <p>STB said yes­ter­day that the eas­ing of rules for at­trac­tions comes as op­er­a­tors have been ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing and dis­pers­ing crowds, as well as main­tain­ing high stan­dards of clean­li­ness and hy­giene.</p>
    <p>All at­trac­tions have also in­tro­duced on­line book­ing sys­tems that help to mon­i­tor and con­trol vis­i­tor num­bers, it said.</p>
    <p>Gar­dens by the Bay is among the op­er­a­tors that are plan­ning to scale up their ca­pac­ity to meet an ex­pected in­crease in de­mand when the $100 Sin­gapo-Redis­cov­ers vouch­ers are is­sued to Sin­ga­pore­ans in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal sup­port has been en­cour­ag­ing to date, with more t han 480,000 recorded vis­its since July, said Mr Ja­son Koo, its di­rec­tor for at­trac­tions op­er­a­tions and vis­i­tor ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Crowds will con­tinue to be man­aged through the use of time­den­try tick­ets which must be pre­pur­chased on­line, he said.</p>
    <p>Gar­dens by the Bay will also be bring­ing back pro­grammes such as the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val light-up and Christ­mas flo­ral dis­play at the Flower Dome, al­beit on a smaller scale.</p>
    <p>Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore (WRS), which op­er­ates the Sin­ga­pore Zoo, Night Sa­fari, River Sa­fari and Jurong Bird Park, is also plan­ning to in­crease ca­pac­ity at its parks.</p>
    <p>WRS deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive Cheng Wen-Haur said vis­i­tor­ship had dropped early in the year, as fears over the coro­n­avirus led some to avoid wildlife parks. But it has since re­bounded, with ca­pac­ity maxed out on some week­ends.</p>
    <p>The added ca­pac­ity al­lowance will “re­ally help”, he added, as many pre­fer to visit in the morn­ing, while the later slots are less pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>The larger au­di­ence size al­lowed at the parks’ pop­u­lar out­door shows is also a re­lief.</p>
    <p>“A lot of vis­i­tors have been dis­ap­pointed be­cause they can’t catch the show” ow­ing to the cur­rent limit of 50 peo­ple, he said.</p>
    <p>Despite the pan­demic-re­lated set­backs, Jurong Bird Park is on track to move to the Mandai precinct in 2022, with the open­ing of the new Rain­for­est Park and other at­trac­tions in the eco­tourism hub to fol­low.</p>
    <p>The new bird park will have big­ger walk-in aviaries, new species, more in­ter­ac­tive ex­pe­ri­ences and con­tact­less touch­points, Dr Cheng said.</p>
    <p>STB said yes­ter­day that the eas­ing of rules for at­trac­tions comes as op­er­a­tors have been ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing and dis­pers­ing crowds, as well as main­tain­ing high stan­dards of clean­li­ness and hy­giene. All at­trac­tions have also in­tro­duced on­line book­ing sys­tems that help to mon­i­tor and con­trol vis­i­tor num­bers, it said.</p>
