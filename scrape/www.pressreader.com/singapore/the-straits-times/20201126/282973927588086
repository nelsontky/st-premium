    <p>Tai­wanese idol Lai Kuan-lin (left) has apol­o­gised af­ter he was pho­tographed by Chi­nese me­dia for smok­ing, not wear­ing his mask prop­erly and spit­ting on the road.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old is a for­mer mem­ber of the now-dis­banded K-pop boy band Wanna One, which were formed through the sec­ond sea­son of South Korean tal­ent com­pe­ti­tion Pro­duce 101 (2017).</p>
    <p>He is fur­ther­ing his ca­reer in China and was caught by the pa­parazzi there when he pulled his mask down to his chin to smoke.</p>
    <p>The pho­tos caused an uproar in the on­line com­mu­nity in China, as bad hy­giene and poor mask-wear­ing prac­tices have been frowned upon amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A con­trite Lai re­sponded on Weibo. In the first post on Tues­day, he wrote: “I’m sorry. I did not prop­erly con­trol my ac­tions and pro­vide a good ex­am­ple as a public fig­ure. I will ac­cept ev­ery­one’s crit­i­cisms of me and never do any­thing sim­i­lar again.”</p>
    <p>In an­other post later that day, he up­loaded an im­age of a seem­ingly hand­writ­ten note. “Even in places where peo­ple can’t see me, I should have held my­self to a higher stan­dard. To do some­thing so in­ap­pro­pri­ate is a part of my­self I have to im­prove. I will re­mem­ber my mis­takes and re­solve to change.”</p>
    <p>As to a fan’s claim that Lai has a se­cret girl­friend, he wrote: “As for my per­sonal life, if there’s happy news, I’ll let ev­ery­one know im­me­di­ately. But right now, I would like to work hard and fo­cus on my ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>The com­ments on his posts are largely neg­a­tive, with fans say­ing they are dis­ap­pointed and “giv­ing up” on him.</p>
    <p>Some felt be­trayed by Lai sup­pos­edly dat­ing be­hind their back. Oth­ers asked him to ex­pe­ri­ence sweep­ing the streets, in re­sponse to his spit­ting.</p>
