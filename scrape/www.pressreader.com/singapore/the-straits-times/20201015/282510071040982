    <p>NEW YORK • No one ex­pected so many peo­ple to come to Michael Che’s im­promptu com­edy show in June.</p>
    <p>The Satur­day Night Live per­former did lit­tle to pub­li­cise it, ex­cept men­tion it on In­sta­gram the day be­fore.</p>
    <p>But that was all he needed to do. Two weeks ear­lier, Mr Ge­orge Floyd had been killed by Min­neapo­lis po­lice of­fi­cers, pro­vok­ing na­tion­wide protests, many of them or­gan­ised on In­sta­gram. Che’s show ended up be­ing pro­moted by sev­eral #Black­Lives­Mat­ter ac­counts.</p>
    <p>“We had to close the gates, we were try­ing to spread peo­ple out, we were hand­ing out masks,” said Mr Edjo Wheeler, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of Cul­ture Lab LIC, the com­mu­nity cen­tre that had or­gan­ised the show in its carpark.</p>
    <p>Spec­ta­tors lined the chain-link fence around the lot. Peo­ple stood on nearby rooftops.</p>
    <p>“There was a glut of hu­man­ity star­ing down upon us,” re­called Ms Rebecca Trent, Che’s friend and the owner of the Creek & the Cave com­edy club in Long Is­land City, Queens, who had helped or­gan­ise the show. She es­ti­mated that there were some 750 peo­ple in at­ten­dance. Mr Wheeler thought it was closer to 2,000.</p>
    <p>It was a good sign for com­edy dur­ing lock­down in the United States, where vaunted clubs such as Caro­lines and the Com­edy Cel­lar re­main dark while in­de­pen­dent pro­duc­ers and co­me­di­ans hus­tle to make gigs work out­doors.</p>
    <p>Ms Trent and Mr Wheeler con­tin­ued to put on com­edy in the carpark, cap­ping au­di­ences, in­stalling lights and us­ing the bed of a rusted pick-up truck as a stage; in a step up from some other out­door al­ter­na­tives – parks and rooftops – that had cropped up dur­ing the shut­down. There were food trucks and an out­side bar, too.</p>
    <p>By late sum­mer, how­ever, just as out­door com­edy in New York was start­ing to see some suc­cess, the carpark shows – in ad­di­tion to other of­fi­cial out­door com­edy events where al­co­hol was served – shut down.</p>
    <p>The New York State Liquor Author­ity had strength­ened its an­nounce­ment that the only kind of live en­ter­tain­ment per­mit­ted where food and drinks were served – even from food trucks – would be mu­sic. Restau­rants could host live mu­sic, but not live com­edy.</p>
    <p>As the city con­tin­ues to re­open in­door spa­ces, in­clud­ing mu­se­ums, bowl­ing al­leys, gyms and, most re­cently, restau­rants – all at lim­ited ca­pac­ity – com­edy clubs, most of which have liquor li­cences and serve food, re­main shut­tered, mostly un­able to pro­duce events with­out ex­pen­sive work­arounds.</p>
    <p>Co­me­di­ans, mean­while, have re­turned to more un­der­ground ways of per­form­ing out­side.</p>
    <p>But now, as the weather starts to cool, those op­tions could soon van­ish.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, a group of comics and com­edy club own­ers gath­ered out­side the New York Com­edy Club in</p>
    <p>Man­hat­tan’s East Vil­lage to get the gover­nor’s at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>“We’re hold­ing this rally to ask that New York state give live en­ter­tain­ment the same con­sid­er­a­tion that’s been given to other in­dus­tries,” said Ms Kam­bri Crews, the owner of QED As­to­ria – one of the event’s or­gan­is­ers – on be­half of the newly formed New York Com­edy Club Coali­tion.</p>
    <p>The coali­tion had sub­mit­ted a five-page pro­posal to New York Gover­nor An­drew Cuomo early last month out­lin­ing its de­mands.</p>
    <p>Speak­ers at the rally ar­gued that sanc­tioned com­edy club shows could be bet­ter reg­u­lated through ticket sales and con­tact trac­ing. Ban­ning them, they said, would only en­cour­age a speak-easy cul­ture. But not much has changed.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing is mov­ing fast enough,” Ms Trent said. “None of these de­ci­sions seem to be based in logic.”</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the rules have not stopped some en­ter­pris­ing clubs. The New York Com­edy Club, for ex­am­ple, has be­gun host­ing BYOB (bring your own bottle) pop-ups on pri­vate rooftops, where its own­ers do not have to worry about the liquor author­ity re­vok­ing the busi­ness’ li­cence.</p>
    <p>But the op­por­tu­nity of­ten comes at a hefty price.</p>
    <p>Rental spa­ces can run any­where from US$2,500 (S$3,400) to US$5,000 for the day, said club co-owner Emilio Savone, adding that the New York Com­edy Club still pays monthly rent on its two per­ma­nent spa­ces, though the land­lords have re­duced rent by about half since the pan­demic.</p>
