    <p>Even as Asean com­bats the coro­n­avirus, it has to pre­pare for the post-pan­demic nor­mal and con­tinue to co­op­er­ate in ar­eas of com­mon in­ter­est, said Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes more re­cent ar­eas of col­lab­o­ra­tion, such as cy­ber se­cu­rity and de­vel­op­ing smart cities, as well as longer-stand­ing ones like stop­ping trans­bound­ary crime and tack­ling cli­mate change, he added yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This will en­sure that Asean re­mains re­silient and rel­e­vant in the decades to come,” said Mr Tan, who spoke on day one of the 41st gen­eral as­sem­bly of the Asean In­ter-Par­lia­men­tary As­sem­bly (Aipa).</p>
    <p>Aipa, which com­prises all 10 Par­lia­ments of Asean, holds a yearly fo­rum where mem­bers ex­change views and spe­cific com­mit­tees dis­cuss and adopt res­o­lu­tions on re­gional mat­ters.</p>
    <p>The fo­rum was held vir­tu­ally this year, due to the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan led the Sin­ga­pore del­e­ga­tion of 18 MPs, which in­cluded Deputy Speaker of Par­lia­ment Jes­sica Tan and Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh.</p>
    <p>In his speech dur­ing the fo­rum, which will run till to­mor­row, Mr Tan noted that how Asean re­sponds to Covid-19 will im­pact the re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tion in the decades to come.</p>
    <p>He called for a co­or­di­nated and well-cal­i­brated ap­proach to re­gional chal­lenges, and stressed the im­por­tance of strength­en­ing ex­ist­ing re­gional co­op­er­a­tion to fight the out­break, say­ing ef­forts should go be­yond the health sec­tor and in­clude the pan­demic’s im­pact on the econ­omy as well as the liveli­hoods of ci­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­men­tar­i­ans have an im­por­tant role to play in rep­re­sent­ing the needs of their ci­ti­zens and sup­port­ing their re­spec­tive coun­tries’ re­sponses to Covid-19, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that MPs are in a strong and unique po­si­tion to pro­mote un­der­stand­ing and aware­ness of Asean.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Tan: “This is ever more im­por­tant, as re­gional and in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion will be crit­i­cal in restor­ing transna­tional travel, sup­ply chain con­nec­tiv­ity and eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in the wake of the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Mem­ber coun­tries will also need to con­tinue us­ing Asean’s plat­forms like Aipa to foster greater co­op­er­a­tion and to build mu­tual un­der­stand­ing, trust and con­fi­dence, he said, so that all 10 mem­ber coun­tries can weather the Covid-19 storm to­gether.</p>
    <p>“We will need to work closely to­gether and with our ex­ter­nal part­ners, in­clud­ing through the shar­ing of in­for­ma­tion and best prac­tices, to re­main re­spon­sive and safe­guard the well-be­ing of our peo­ples,” he added.</p>
