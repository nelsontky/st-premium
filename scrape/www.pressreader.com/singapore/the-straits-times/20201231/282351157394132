    <p>Two men who in­ter­vened when they re­alised that women were be­ing tar­geted by voyeurs were lauded by the Public Trans­port Se­cu­rity Com­mand (Tran­sCom).</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Jun Jie, 25, and Mr Chan Heng Wei, 23, were among 15 peo­ple who re­ceived the Public Spirit­ed­ness Award (PSA) from Tran­sCom this month. They were recog­nised for their ef­forts to as­sist the police in in­ci­dents that hap­pened on public trans­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee was stuck on a crowded train on March 16, when he spot­ted a man be­hav­ing sus­pi­ciously.</p>
    <p>The man, who was stand­ing, was ad­just­ing his brief­case that was placed on the floor near a woman.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee no­ticed that a phone was placed on the brief­case, and the man had po­si­tioned it un­der the skirt of the woman, who was also stand­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee con­fronted the man and de­manded to see his phone.</p>
    <p>On it, Mr Lee found sev­eral up­skirt pho­tos of the woman.</p>
    <p>After the woman con­firmed that she wanted to re­port the mat­ter to the police, Mr Lee es­corted the man out of the train and re­ported the in­ci­dent to of­fi­cers at MacPherson MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The man was sub­se­quently ar­rested for voyeurism.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia yes­ter­day, Mr Lee, who is a sup­ply chain plan­ner, said: “I wasn’t re­ally shocked be­cause in my NS (na­tional ser­vice) days, I was a police of­fi­cer, so I reg­u­larly en­coun­tered this kind of crime... But the nor­mal pro­ce­dure as a mem­ber of the public is to in­form the right authoritie­s and let them ad­dress it ac­cord­ingly.”</p>
    <p>He added: “I was sur­prised that the guy was very co­op­er­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, a Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences fi­nance un­der­grad­u­ate, was walk­ing to­wards Ang Mo Kio MRT sta­tion on Oct 15 when he no­ticed a man point­ing his phone un­der a woman’s skirt on the es­ca­la­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan alerted the MRT staff be­fore get­ting on the same train car­riage as the man and woman.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan then told the woman that he had seen the man tak­ing up</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Jun Jie (left), 25, and Mr Chan Heng Wei, 23, were among 15 re­cip­i­ents of the Public Spirit­ed­ness Award from the Public Trans­port Se­cu­rity Com­mand ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>skirt pho­tos of her. The police later found the man and ar­rested him.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said: “I know of friends who don’t wear safety shorts un­der their skirts and I wouldn’t want this to hap­pen to them.”</p>
    <p>Com­man­der of Tran­sCom, Deputy As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner of Police Fanny Koh Bee Yuan, said of the PSA re­cip­i­ents: “They have show­cased the strong part­ner­ship be­tween the police and the com­mu­nity that will con­tinue to help keep the public trans­port net­work safe and se­cure.”</p>
    <p>Public ac­tion is not al­ways straight­for­ward.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber last year, sev­eral con­cerned res­i­dents re­strained a 46-year-old man who was al­legedly spot­ted tak­ing up­skirt videos of a woman at Lit­tle In­dia MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Five peo­ple de­tained him in Niven Road after a short chase.</p>
    <p>When police of­fi­cers ar­rived at the scene, the sus­pect was mo­tion­less and had no pulse.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers per­formed car­diopul</p>
    <p>monary re­sus­ci­ta­tion on the man un­til Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force paramedics ar­rived. But he was pro­nounced dead.</p>
    <p>In a sub­se­quent hear­ing, State Coroner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam found that the mem­bers of the public had not used ex­ces­sive force and his death was due to a “nat­u­ral dis­ease process”. But she added that it is pre­ferred and safer for the police to han­dle such mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times, the police said that when­ever pos­si­ble, the public should re­port any sus­pected crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity to them first.</p>
    <p>“Com­mu­nity in­volve­ment re­mains an es­sen­tial pil­lar in our fight against crime.”</p>
    <p>But in some sit­u­a­tions, the police said mem­bers of the public may be able to in­ter­vene to pre­vent or mit­i­gate loss to life and prop­erty, or the harm caused from the crime, be­fore of­fi­cers ar­rive.</p>
