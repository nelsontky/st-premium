    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>Sin Chew Daily, Malaysia</p>
    <p>When world-class phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals an­nounced that they had suc­cess­fully de­vel­oped the coro­n­avirus vac­cines, Health Min­is­ter Ad­ham Baba said the min­istry had to first make sure the vac­cines would not have side ef­fects for the re­cip­i­ents, mean­ing we still need to go through the “pro­fes­sional eval­u­a­tion and ob­ser­va­tion” be­fore plac­ing the or­der, as the rest of the world is rush­ing to grab the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>As such, when the vac­cines are al­ready in the mar­ket, they may not be avail­able to us yet. Malaysians may have to travel over­seas to get the in­jec­tion if they re­ally want the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Given the Malaysian health min­istry’s pas­sive at­ti­tude at this mo­ment, the ap­prox­i­mately two bil­lion doses com­ing on­line next year may not get to make it to Malaysia!</p>
    <p>An­other con­cern is that we won’t be able to buy Pfizer’s vac­cine as we do not have cold chain trans­porta­tion tech­nol­ogy ca­pa­ble of trans­port­ing and stor­ing the vac­cine at mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>As we do not have the tech­nol­ogy to trans­port the vac­cine at such low tem­per­a­tures, we have to ex­clude Pfizer’s vac­cine for the time be­ing, and fight for Moderna’s limited pro­duc­tion with the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s vac­cine pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity will only be able to meet 13 per cent of global de­mand, and if we do not fight for it, we may not even get the vac­cine by 2023, not to men­tion next year.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess­ful devel­op­ment of coro­n­avirus vac­cines is no doubt great news for the world, but that does not mean we can take things lightly. We must ready our­selves to ac­quire the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Moira Gal­laga</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Daily In­quirer, The Philip­pines</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, Pres­i­dent Duterte has or­dered the Na­tional Task Force Against Covid-19 to pur­chase an ini­tial 60 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine once it is avail­able.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing that our gov­ern­ment has suc­cess­fully se­cured the ini­tial 60 mil­lion doses of vac­cines it in­tends to pro­cure, it will re­quire con­sid­er­able re­sources to trans­port and dis­trib­ute those mil­lions of vials of vac­cines to their in­tended ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>First of all, the vac­cines re­quire spe­cial han­dling.</p>
    <p>In terms of trans­port, it will take the equiv­a­lent of 60 Boe­ing 777 freighters to fly the 60 mil­lion doses to the Philip­pines. With the ris­ing cost of ship­ping and freight rates, plans should al­ready be put in place to en­sure that the coun­try is pre­pared and ready once the sup­ply of vac­cines is avail­able.</p>
    <p>Once the vac­cine ar­rives in the coun­try, the next chal­lenge is trans­port­ing it to other parts of the coun­try. Do we have ad­e­quate lo­gis­ti­cal as­sets that also en­sure the in­tegrity of the cold chain sys­tem re­quired to pre­vent spoilage of the vac­cines?</p>
    <p>There are other de­tails as well, such as stor­age fa­cil­i­ties, sy­ringes, and cool­ing boxes that will be used when the vac­cines are trans­ported to vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres out in the field.</p>
    <p>Se­ri­ous dis­cus­sion and con­sid­er­a­tion should be made re­gard­ing in­vest­ing in de­vel­op­ing lo­cal pro­duc­tion ca­pa­bil­ity of sy­ringes and other vi­tal com­po­nents of the cold chain sys­tem re­quired for vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple’s vac­cine</p>
    <p>Aq­das Afzal Dawn, Pak­istan</p>
    <p>In this most aw­ful year, fi­nally there is some en­cour­ag­ing news. As­traZeneca, BioNTech-Pfizer, and Moderna, lead­ing phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies, have re­vealed stel­lar re­sults for their vac­cine tri­als, in­di­cat­ing the avail­abil­ity of a Covid-19 vac­cine as soon as Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Imran Khan has an­nounced that his gov­ern­ment is set­ting aside US$100 mil­lion (S$133 mil­lion) for pur­chas­ing the Covid-19 vac­cine. But the story does not end here as the path to ob­tain­ing the vac­cine is rid­dled with ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>Procur­ing the Covid-19 vac­cine, is go­ing to test the de­vel­op­ing world’s lead­ers in more ways than one. For starters, get­ting the vac­cine is not only a fi­nanc­ing is­sue; the vac­cine is sim­ply not avail­able.</p>
    <p>A small group of wealthy na­tions – the US in par­tic­u­lar – have all but cor­nered the Covid-19 vac­cine mar­ket by plac­ing ad­vance or­ders. Ox­fam es­ti­mates that a ma­jor­ity of the de­vel­op­ing world will not get ac­cess to the Covid-19 vac­cine un­til late 2022.</p>
    <p>Some econ­o­mists ar­gue that a free vac­cine can­not be pro­vided as it vi­o­lates in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights. Econ­o­mists, how­ever, have also long recog­nised “pub­lic goods” which are a spe­cial class of goods that ben­e­fit ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>In the case of the Covid-19 vac­cine, there is an ur­gent need for iden­ti­fy­ing poli­cies for en­sur­ing fair ac­cess for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. One way in which this can be done is through a Pak­istan-led de­vel­op­ing coun­tries’ push for con­vert­ing the Covid-19 vac­cine into a global pub­lic good, forc­ing wealthy na­tions to share the vac­cine’s for­mula with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies in the de­vel­op­ing world.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Pak­istani pol­i­cy­mak­ers must take stock of their vac­cine de­liv­ery sys­tems. Given the so­cial re­sis­tance against the po­lio vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, pol­i­cy­mak­ers must start work on gen­er­at­ing greater ac­cep­tance for Covid-19 mass vac­ci­na­tion through elec­tronic, print and so­cial me­dia.</p>
