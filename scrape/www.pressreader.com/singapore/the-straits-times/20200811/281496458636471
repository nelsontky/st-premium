    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong me­dia tycoon Jimmy Lai yes­ter­day be­came the high­est-pro­file per­son in the Chi­nese-ruled city to be ar­rested un­der a new na­tional se­cu­rity law, de­tained over sus­pected col­lu­sion with for­eign forces as 200 po­lice searched the of­fices of his Ap­ple Daily news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Lai, 71, has been one of Hong Kong’s most prom­i­nent democ­racy ac­tivists and an ar­dent critic of Bei­jing, which im­posed the sweep­ing new law on the city on June 30, draw­ing con­dem­na­tion from Western coun­tries.</p>
    <p>His ar­rest comes amid Bei­jing’s crack­down against pro-democ­racy opposition in the city and fur­ther stokes con­cerns about me­dia and other free­doms promised to the former Bri­tish colony when it was re­turned to China in 1997.</p>
    <p>Lai’s ar­rest “bears out the worst fears that Hong Kong’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity Law would be used to sup­press crit­i­cal pro-democ­racy opin­ion and restrict press free­dom”, said Mr Steven But­ler, Asia pro­gramme co­or­di­na­tor for the Com­mit­tee to Pro­tect Jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>Mr Ryan Law, chief ed­i­tor of Ap­ple Daily, a staunch anti-gov­ern­ment and pro-democ­racy tabloid that also does in­ves­tiga­tive work, said the pa­per would not be in­tim­i­dated. “Busi­ness as usual,” he said.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity law pun­ishes any­thing China con­sid­ers sub­ver­sion, se­ces­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces with up to life in prison. Critics say it crushes free­doms, while sup­port­ers say it will bring sta­bil­ity af­ter pro­longed prodemoc­racy protests last year.</p>
    <p>Lai had been a fre­quent vis­i­tor to Wash­ing­ton, where he has met of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, to rally sup­port for Hong Kong democ­racy, prompt­ing Bei­jing to la­bel him a “traitor”.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese state me­dia said Bei­jing sup­ports Lai’s ar­rest, stress­ing the need to “se­verely pun­ish” those who col­lude with for­eign forces to en­dan­ger na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Lai was a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of peo­ple who were “anti-China, an­tiHong Kong” and who were a dan­ger that must be re­moved be­fore there could be peace in Hong Kong, a spokesman for China’s Hong</p>
    <p>Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice told the Xinhua agency yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said they had ar­rested 10 peo­ple, aged be­tween 23 and 72, on sus­pi­cion of breach­ing the new se­cu­rity law. Ac­tivist Agnes Chow was among those held, ac­cord­ing to a po­lice source and her ver­i­fied Face­book ac­count.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple Daily re­ported that Lai had been taken from his home early yes­ter­day. He was taken back to the of­fice later in hand­cuffs.</p>
    <p>“We can’t worry that much, we can only go with the flow,” he said, be­fore be­ing es­corted away.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said around 200 of­fi­cers en­tered the premises with a court war­rant and col­lected 25 boxes of ev­i­dence. The law al­lows po­lice to search premises without one “un­der ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances”, and for doc­u­ments, equip­ment and fi­nan­cial as­sets to be seized.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple Daily re­ported that one of Lai’s sons, Ian, had also been ar­rested at his home and later showed his restau­rant, Cafe Sea­sons, be­ing raided by po­lice.</p>
    <p>Shares in the me­dia com­pany</p>
    <p>Next Digital, which pub­lishes Ap­ple Daily, plunged 16.7 per cent be­fore re­bound­ing to trade 344 per cent higher as on­line pro-democ­racy fo­rums called on in­vestors to buy shares as a show of sup­port.</p>
    <p>An Ap­ple Daily source said other se­nior ex­ec­u­tives were among those tar­geted. Ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Che­ung Kim Hung was seen es­corted by po­lice out of the build­ing.</p>
    <p>“We see this as straight ha­rass­ment,” the source said, adding that Lai was ar­rested on sus­pi­cion of sedi­tion, crim­i­nal fraud and col­lud­ing with for­eign forces.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Next Me­dia Trade Union called the search “an ex­tremely rare and se­ri­ous in­ci­dent in Hong Kong his­tory”, with a “cat­a­strophic” im­pact.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong Jour­nal­ists As­so­ci­a­tion chair­man Chris Ye­ung said the search was akin to “Third World” press free­dom sup­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple Daily ex­ec­u­tive Chan Pui Man said the news­pa­per would still be pub­lished to­day.</p>
    <p>Lai had also been ar­rested this year on il­le­gal as­sem­bly charges, along with other lead­ing ac­tivists, re­lat­ing to protests last year.</p>
    <p>The United States had last Fri­day im­posed sanc­tions on Hong Kong leader Car­rie Lam and other of­fi­cials, draw­ing mock­ery and con­dem­na­tion from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The ar­rest re­flects that Hong Kong “wasn’t in­tim­i­dated” by sanc­tions, Global Times ed­i­tor Hu Xi­jin tweeted. Global Times is pub­lished by China’s Com­mu­nist Party news­pa­per Peo­ple’s Daily.</p>
    <p>WORST FEARS RE­ALISED</p>
    <p>The ar­rest bears out the worst fears that Hong Kong’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity Law would be used to sup­press crit­i­cal pro-democ­racy opin­ion and restrict press free­dom. ’’</p>
    <p>MR STEVEN BUT­LER, Asia pro­gramme co­or­di­na­tor for the Com­mit­tee to Pro­tect Jour­nal­ists, on the ar­rest of Jimmy Lai.</p>
