    <p>WASHINGTON • Moderna’s vac­cine is safe and ef­fec­tive for pre­vent­ing Covid-19, US reg­u­la­tors said, clear­ing the way for a sec­ond vac­cine to quickly gain emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion and add to the coun­try’s sprawl­ing im­mu­ni­sa­tion ef­fort.</p>
    <p>The Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion’s (FDA) staff said in a re­port posted on­line yes­ter­day that the ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine is 94.1 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing symp­to­matic Covid-19, con­firm­ing re­sults ear­lier re­leased by the US drug­maker.</p>
    <p>The re­port came ahead of a meet­ing to­mor­row of agency ad­vis­ers who will vote whether to rec­om­mend au­tho­ri­sa­tion be­fore a fi­nal FDA de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The agency does not have to fol­low the ad­vice of the in­de­pen­dent vac­cine ex­perts, though it of­ten agrees with its ad­vi­sory pan­els. Last week, the FDA au­tho­rised a sim­i­lar vac­cine from Pfizer and BioNTech af­ter an ad­vi­sory panel voted 17-4, with one ab­sten­tion, to sup­port its au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The FDA got a much deeper look at Moderna’s clin­i­cal trial data than the num­bers the firm had pre­vi­ously re­leased to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>No­tably, the agency was able to re­view the shot’s ef­fec­tive­ness across a broad range of racial, eth­nic and age groups, and look at how well the shot worked for peo­ple with pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions that make them more vul­ner­a­ble to se­vere Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The agency found the shot was sim­i­larly ef­fec­tive across racial and eth­nic groups and those with un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>It was 86.4 per cent ef­fec­tive in peo­ple aged 65 and over, and 95.6 per cent ef­fec­tive in those aged 18 to 65.</p>
    <p>Both the Moderna and Pfizer vac­cines are based on mes­sen­ger RNA tech­nol­ogy that has not been pre­vi­ously used in in­oc­u­la­tions. Both are two-dose vac­cines, mean­ing once peo­ple re­ceive an ini­tial shot, they will need to re­turn weeks later for a sec­ond shot.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s vac­cine is not yet ap­proved in any coun­try and has not yet been used on any­one out­side of a clin­i­cal trial. Once the US grants au­tho­ri­sa­tion, ad­vis­ers to the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion must meet, as they did last week on Pfizer’s vac­cine, to give Moderna’s shot the green light and pro­vide spe­cific rec­om­men­da­tions for use and mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
