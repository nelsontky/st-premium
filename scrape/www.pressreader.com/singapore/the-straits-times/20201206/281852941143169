    <p>LON­DON An In­dian teacher has been named the win­ner of a US$1 mil­lion (S$1.3 mil­lion) prize for his work in trans­form­ing the lives of young girls in a ru­ral vil­lage.</p>
    <p>Mr Ran­jitsinh Disale was an­nounced the win­ner of the Global Teacher Prize 2020 last Thurs­day at a vir­tual cer­e­mony broad­cast from the Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum in Lon­don, and he opted to split half his win­nings with his fel­low fi­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>He was se­lected from 12,000 nom­i­na­tions from more than 140 coun­tries around the world.</p>
    <p>His de­ci­sion means US$55,000 will go to each of the other nine fi­nal­ists from na­tions in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>Italy, Nige­ria and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Mr Disale is the sixth win­ner of the award, which is spon­sored by the United Na­tions ed­u­ca­tional and cul­tural agency Unesco.</p>
    <p>He said the coro­n­avirus pan­demic had shown the im­por­tance of ed­u­ca­tion to com­mu­ni­ties: “In this hard time, teach­ers are giv­ing their best to make sure every stu­dent has ac­cess to their birthright of a good ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Disale added that all teach­ers were “the real change-mak­ers who are chang­ing the lives of their stu­dents” and it was in this spirit that he was shar­ing his win­nings.</p>
    <p>The teacher ar­rived at the Zilla Par­ishad Pri­mary School in a small vil­lage near So­la­pur, in In­dia’s Ma­ha­rash­tra state, in 2009.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­ven­ing years, he trans­formed school at­ten­dance among the sur­round­ing tribal com­mu­nity from 2 per cent to 100 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Ste­fa­nia Gian­nini, as­sis­tant direc­tor gen­eral for ed­u­ca­tion at Unesco, said teach­ers like Mr Disale would build “more peace­ful and just so­ci­eties”.</p>
    <p>“Teach­ers like Ran­jitsinh will elim­i­nate in­equal­i­ties and drive for­ward eco­nomic growth,” she added.</p>
