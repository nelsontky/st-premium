    <p>Some res­i­dents have banded to­gether to bring Christ­mas cheer to their block in Be­dok Reser­voir Road. A 3.5m-tall Christ­mas tree, con­structed by res­i­dents, stands proudly in front of the block, and is sur­rounded by four rein­deer fig­urines.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh Siew Hua, 53, who led the project with her hus­band, said they have been dec­o­rat­ing the block for Christ­mas since 2011, to­gether with their neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is very down this year. Some are job­less, some of the older res­i­dents have fewer vis­its from their fam­ily due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions. Our dec­o­ra­tions give peo­ple some­thing to do,” said Ms Goh, who co-owns a tent­age com­pany with her hus­band.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents in the heart­land are cel­e­brat­ing Christ­mas by spruc­ing up their very own cor­ner of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>From Sem­bawang in the north to Clementi in the west as well as Be­dok, Tampines and Pasir Ris in the east, lo­cals are adding their own lights and tin­sel to dec­o­ra­tions put up in Hous­ing Board es­tates.</p>
    <p>From a 3.5m-tall Christ­mas tree in front of Block 702 Be­dok Reser­voir Road, made from steel re­in­force­ment bars and a dis­carded gate, to a minia­ture church made of boxes and sty­ro­foam con­tain­ers in Tampines, res­i­dents vol­un­teered their time to bring cheer amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Beng Huat sin­gle­hand­edly put up the Christ­mas dec­o­ra­tions this year at Block 722 Tampines Street 72. For over 10 years, he has marked the sea­son by bright­en­ing up his HDB block with tin­sel and fes­tive trim­mings.</p>
    <p>In pre-pan­demic times, he would even hold a light­ing-up cer­e­mony and in­vite his neigh­bours to soak in the fes­tive spirit. The cen­tre­piece this year is a 1.6m-tall “snow­capped” church, which is flanked by Fa­ther Christ­mas fig­urines.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, who runs an elec­tri­cal works busi­ness, had worked on the piece for two hours ev­ery night since Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one should gather to­gether and get to know each other bet­ter dur­ing the hol­i­days,” he said.</p>
    <p>Clementi res­i­dent Philip Sobrielo Gene has livened up his part of town as well. The free­lance dance in­struc­tor, 40, teamed up with the Jurong-Clementi Town Coun­cil to dec­o­rate the empty space in front of his child­hood home at Block 351 Clementi Av­enue 2.</p>
    <p>It was a big change from 2018, when Mr Sobrielo was asked by the town coun­cil to re­move a man­nequin he had dressed up for Christ­mas from the se­cond-storey ledge of the block.</p>
    <p>He was al­lowed to keep it there af­ter checks showed the dec­o­ra­tions did not pose a safety is­sue.</p>
    <p>This year, Mr Sobrielo decked out a tree, which was pro­vided by the town coun­cil, with plas­tic poin­set­tias, and sur­rounded it with gift boxes big and small.</p>
    <p>“Christ­mas is a time for giv­ing, whether it is presents, money or time. My dec­o­ra­tions are my way of giv­ing back to the com­mu­nity, whether they are of the faith or not,” added the Catholic.</p>
    <p>Over at Block 121 Can­berra Street in Sem­bawang, housewife Luu Thi My Uyen, 43, led a team of 10 from the East Can­berra Zone 2 Res­i­dents’ Net­work to build a 3m-tall Christ­mas tree us­ing a metal frame and green net­ting.</p>
    <p>“With the Christ­mas tree, we hope peo­ple can still come down with their fam­i­lies to take photos for the mem­o­ries,” said the per­ma­nent res­i­dent from Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>In Pasir Ris, a 6m-tall Christ­mas tree and rows of fairy lights daz­zle on­look­ers. About 40 mer­chants and hawk­ers from the Pasir Ris Drive 4 and 6 Mer­chants and Hawk­ers As­so­ci­a­tion chipped in for the dec­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh Siew Hua, 53, who ini­ti­ated the Christ­mas tree project at Be­dok Reser­voir Road with her hus­band Cheah Kok Hwa, 57, said the dec­o­ra­tions this year are es­pe­cially mean­ing­ful. The cou­ple own a tent­age com­pany.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is very down this year. Some are job­less, some of the older res­i­dents have fewer vis­its from their fam­ily due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions. Adding dec­o­ra­tions to the tree gave peo­ple some­thing to do,” said Ms Goh.</p>
    <p>TIME Christ­mas OF GIV­ING is a time for giv­ing, whether it is presents, money or time. My dec­o­ra­tions are my way of giv­ing back to the com­mu­nity, whether they are of the faith or not. CLEMENTI RES­I­DENT</p>
    <p>PHILIP SOBRIELO GENE</p>
    <p>GET­TING PEO­PLE IN­VOLVED Ev­ery­one is very down this year. Some are job­less, some of the older res­i­dents have fewer vis­its from their fam­ily due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions. Adding dec­o­ra­tions to the tree gave peo­ple some­thing to do.</p>
    <p>MS GOH SIEW HUA, who ini­ti­ated the Christ­mas tree project at Be­dok Reser­voir Road with her hus­band.</p>
    <p>While most new­ly­weds look for­ward to their first home as a pri­vate space, one Sin­ga­porean cou­ple have opened their doors to four fam­i­lies who needed a tem­po­rary roof over their heads.</p>
    <p>So­cial worker Joanne Ong, 26, and en­gi­neer Melvin Soon, 28, have taken in dif­fer­ent fam­i­lies since their new home was ren­o­vated in Au­gust last year, even mov­ing out in March so a fam­ily of seven stranded in Sin­ga­pore could get shel­ter in their home.</p>
    <p>“We have al­ways be­lieved in help­ing others and af­ter the stay of the third fam­ily, we re­alised our home is a place for shar­ing with others,” said Ms Ong.</p>
    <p>In the spirit of com­mu­nity and giv­ing this Christ­mas, the cou­ple is host­ing three groups in their five­room flat in Jurong West on dif­fer­ent days this fes­tive week.</p>
    <p>“We will host the chil­dren whom we have seen grow up through the years. We are for­tu­nate to have been able to deepen our friend­ships with them and be pos­i­tive role mod­els to them,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing a dif­fer­ence to those around them is the norm for Ms Ong and Mr Soon. To mark their first year to­gether while dat­ing, they printed mugs and roped in their friends to cel­e­brate Chil­dren’s Day with un­der­priv­i­leged chil­dren in dif­fer­ent es­tates.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing her univer­sity years, Ms Ong did vol­un­teer work with chil­dren liv­ing in pub­lic rental flats. Learn­ing about their chal­lenges and re­silience made an im­pact on her.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band take life’s small dis­ap­point­ments in their stride, turn­ing them into op­por­tu­ni­ties to serve others.</p>
    <p>While view­ing the flat in Jurong West, the two avid vol­un­teers found that fam­i­lies they were help­ing were liv­ing nearby.</p>
    <p>“If we had bought a home in Pung­gol, the fam­i­lies we know here may find it dif­fi­cult to visit us. This way, we can meet them of­ten,” said Mr Soon.</p>
    <p>Their first guest fam­ily came soon af­ter their home ren­o­va­tions were com­pleted in Au­gust last year. They stayed for a week while the cou­ple con­tin­ued to live with their par­ents.</p>
    <p>The se­cond fam­ily stayed for two weeks. In March this year, Ms Ong and Mr Soon moved into their new home af­ter their wed­ding.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 cases spiked in Sin­ga­pore and the coun­try’s borders were closed, they heard from friends about a fam­ily of seven from Brazil who were stranded here. The cou­ple gave their home to the fam­ily to stay in for two months while the duo moved in with friends.</p>
    <p>While there are chal­lenges and in­con­ve­niences, the cou­ple say they have no re­grets.</p>
    <p>“We had thought about how we would feel if some­thing was dam­aged in our newly ren­o­vated home. But ul­ti­mately, we de­cided we could live with it, be­cause we ex­pe­ri­enced the joy of help­ing others,” said Mr Soon.</p>
    <p>They are now host­ing a sin­gle mother with a child, shar­ing meals with them and even or­gan­is­ing a sur­prise birth­day party for her son.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this Christ­mas week, they have hosted two par­ties for the chil­dren Ms Ong has been men­tor­ing since her univer­sity days.</p>
    <p>In the new year, they plan to in</p>
    <p>vite their neigh­bours for a meal and get to know them.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Ong: “Liv­ing in an HDB es­tate, it’s easy to lose the kam­pung spirit. We want to know our neigh­bours so that we can help and sup­port each other in times of need.”</p>
