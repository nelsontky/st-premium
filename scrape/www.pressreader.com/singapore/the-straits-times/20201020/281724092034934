    <p>BRUS­SELS • A raft of Euro­pean coun­tries, in­clud­ing Italy and Bel­gium, took des­per­ate new mea­sures yes­ter­day to try to com­bat a se­cond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions as the death toll from Covid-19 sur­passed 250,000 in Europe, ac­cord­ing to an Agence France-Presse tally.</p>
    <p>Many govern­ments are seek­ing to avoid the full-on lock­downs im­posed in the first wave as they bat­tle to keep their economies go­ing, but in some coun­tries, people are chaf­ing at the new re­stric­tions on daily life.</p>
    <p>In Bel­gium, where hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions rose 100 per cent in just the last week, bars and restau­rants were closed yes­ter­day for a month and a cur­few will be re­in­forced overnight.</p>
    <p>“Man­agers, chefs, dish-wash­ers, ev­ery­one is suf­fer­ing,” Mr An­gelo Bussi said as he put the key in the lock of his Brus­sels res­tau­rant late on Sun­day. “We don’t feel like any­one cares. It breaks my heart.”</p>
    <p>Bel­gium’s se­cond ma­jor l ock­down comes af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Alexan­der de Croo warned that the sit­u­a­tion was “much worse” than in March, when there was an al­most com­plete con­fine­ment.</p>
    <p>Italy, the ini­tial epi­cen­tre of Europe’s out­break, also an­nounced fresh curbs, in­clud­ing ear­lier clo­sures for bars and restau­rants, and a push to in­crease work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>“We can­not waste time,” its Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte said, also flag­ging bans on am­a­teur team sports and lo­cal fes­ti­vals.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Switzer­land made mask wear­ing com­pul­sory in in­door pub­lic spa­ces and put lim­its on pub­lic gather­ings af­ter in­fec­tions dou­bled over the last week.</p>
    <p>“The se­cond wave is here, ear­lier and stronger than we ex­pected, but we are pre­pared,” said Swiss Health Min­is­ter Alain Ber­set.</p>
    <p>Wales an­nounced yes­ter­day that it will im­pose a two-week “fire­break” lock­down from Fri­day in which ev­ery­body apart from es­sen­tial work­ers must stay at home to com­bat an ac­cel­er­at­ing se­cond wave of the virus.</p>
    <p>Welsh First Min­is­ter Mark Drake­ford said he un­der­stood that people are tired of coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions, but tougher rules are es­sen­tial as crit­i­cal care units are al­ready full.</p>
    <p>“It will have to be sharp and deep in or­der to have the im­pact we need,” he told re­porters. “Ev­ery­one in Wales will be re­quired to stay at home. If we do not act now, it will con­tinue to ac­cel­er­ate.”</p>
    <p>All non-es­sen­tial re­tail, leisure, hos­pi­tal­ity and tourist busi­nesses will have to close, as will places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the United King­dom, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son is fac­ing some calls to aban­don his strategy of lo­calised lock­downs in Eng­land and im­pose a na­tion­wide lock­down sim­i­lar to the one en­acted in March dur­ing the first wave of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>His re­gional tiered ap­proach is be­ing tested by Mr Andy Burn­ham, the mayor of Manch­ester, who is op­pos­ing a lock­down on his city with­out in­creased cen­tral gov­ern­ment fund­ing to deal with the eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son has said he may need to in­ter­vene if no deal can be reached, and force the city into the top “very high” risk cat­e­gory, with his of­fice yes­ter­day warn­ing that lo­cal in­ten­sive care ca­pac­ity could be over­whelmed by Nov 12.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr John­son is re­sist­ing rolling out strin­gent re­stric­tions across Eng­land. “You are not go­ing to save lives in parts of the coun­try that have higher in­fec­tion rates by clos­ing down parts of the coun­try that have lower in­fec­tion rates,” his spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while Ir­ish min­is­ters were set to agree yes­ter­day on a new set of strict mea­sures that will shut nonessen­tial re­tail across the coun­try but aim to keep schools open, two sources fa­mil­iar with the plans said.</p>
    <p>Ire­land’s health chiefs last week re­newed a call to move the coun­try to level 5, the high­est level of con­straint. A min­is­ter said on Sun­day that de­ci­sive na­tion­wide mea­sures were com­ing, but that they would stop short of the full lock­down im­posed ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia, how­ever, said it would not in­tro­duce strict re­stric­tions to curb the virus, af­ter daily cases hit a record high of 15,982 yes­ter­day. The au­thor­i­ties also re­ported 179 deaths in the pre­vi­ous 24 hours, bring­ing the of­fi­cial death toll to 24,366.</p>
    <p>A vac­cine re­mains the great hope to end the cy­cle of im­pos­ing and lift­ing lock­downs across the world, and the United Na­tions said yes­ter­day that it would stock­pile a bil­lion sy­ringes world­wide by the end of next year for that pur­pose.</p>
    <p>“Vac­ci­nat­ing the world against Covid-19 will be one of the largest mass un­der­tak­ings in hu­man his­tory, and we will need to move as quickly as the vac­cines can be pro­duced,” Unicef ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Hen­ri­etta Fore said.</p>
