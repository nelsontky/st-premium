    <p>For in­vestors con­tem­plat­ing the lat­est bullish rally in eq­uity mar­kets, it must feel strange that the global econ­omy is get­ting weaker, not stronger, as we head into the year end.</p>
    <p>As new Covid-19 cases surge in the United States and Europe, the global eco­nomic mo­men­tum is wan­ing. The sit­u­a­tion is ex­ac­er­bated by in­ad­e­quate fis­cal sup­port in the US.</p>
    <p>With­out a solid re­cov­ery in sight, lurk­ing in the back­ground is the tail-risk of a major de­fault or bankruptcy.</p>
    <p>It also does not help that out­go­ing US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin re­cently de­clined to ex­tend most of the Fed­eral Re­serve’s emer­gency credit pro­grammes be­yond this year. These pro­grammes had helped to re­store or­derly mar­ket func­tion­ing dur­ing the peak of the Covid-19 cri­sis, and have since served as im­por­tant mar­ket back­stops and a source of sup­port for in­vestor con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>In the US, the lat­est data is clearly sig­nalling a growth slow­down: Re­tail sales for Oc­to­ber rose only 0.3 per cent on a monthly ba­sis af­ter gain­ing 1.6 per cent in the pre­ced­ing month, and ini­tial job­less claims had in­creased for two weeks in a row.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, daily mo­bil­ity data from Google’s ac­tiv­ity in­dex has fallen in re­cent weeks, sug­gest­ing that con­sumer goods spend­ing was neg­a­tively im­pacted last month.</p>
    <p>The rub for in­vestors who are bear­ish on mar­kets, how­ever, is that the sce­nario of a vac­cine-catal­ysed re­cov­ery some time next year is get­ting in­creas­ingly ob­vi­ous.</p>
    <p>With over 40 Covid-19 vac­cines un­der­go­ing clin­i­cal eval­u­a­tions in hu­man be­ings, and over 150 in pre-clin­i­cal eval­u­a­tions, the global vac­cine race is at full steam.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive re­sults so far from Pfizer, Moderna and other phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms that have ended their phase three tri­als clearly sig­nal that this is go­ing smoothly. More up­dates are also ex­pected from major drug mak­ers like No­vavax, John­son & John­son and Sanofi in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The cu­mu­la­tive vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity that has been planned and an­nounced is mas­sive – more than eight bil­lion doses by the end of next year. Fore­cast­ing en­tity, the Good Judg­ment Project, now as­sesses that there is a like­li­hood of more than 90 per cent that enough doses of ap­proved vac­cines to in­oc­u­late 25 mil­lion peo­ple in the US will be dis­trib­uted by March next year.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING AHEAD TO RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>How will fi­nan­cial mar­kets re­act to this di­chotomy be­tween near-term head­winds and the pos­i­tive long-term out­look?</p>
    <p>His­tory tells us mar­kets tend to be for­ward-look­ing. If the on­go­ing Covid-19 waves and pre-vac­cine slow­down are far worse than ex­pected, or if there is a sur­prise major de­fault or bankruptcy that trig­gers sharp risk-off sen­ti­ment, we would then see a sell-off.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, it is more likely that the mar­ket would largely look through to the re­cov­ery next year.</p>
    <p>Clues can be gleaned from how US eq­ui­ties be­haved in Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber, when in­vestors who were ex­pect­ing a new US fis­cal re­lief pack­age to be im­ple­mented late this year were se­verely dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>As the dust set­tled, it turned out that the mar­kets re­mained rel­a­tively sup­ported as in­vestors looked past the near-term dis­ap­point­ment to the fact that new fis­cal re­lief will likely come in the first quar­ter of next year, re­gard­less of who won the US pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Ul­tra-low in­ter­est rates in de­vel­oped mar­kets and on­go­ing as­set pur­chases by the US Fed­eral Re­serve and major cen­tral banks are also sup­port­ive fac­tors for risk as­set prices.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, af­ter the US Trea­sury’s re­cent re­fusal to ex­tend the Fed­eral Re­serve’s emer­gency credit pro­grammes, we see higher odds of the Fed­eral Re­serve ex­pand­ing the scope of its as­set pur­chases this month. This would fur­ther in­ject liq­uid­ity into mar­kets and boost risk as­set prices.</p>
    <p>We main­tain a mod­er­ately risk-on stance in our as­set al­lo­ca­tion strat­egy, which is fo­cused on the con­struc­tive long-term mar­ket out­look, while main­tain­ing an am­ple cash po­si­tion to buf­fer against episodes of near-term volatil­ity.</p>
    <p>We also hold an over­all over­weight view on eq­ui­ties, with a pref­er­ence for Asia ex-Ja­pan mar­kets.</p>
    <p>In our view, China’s solid growth tra­jec­tory will form a key tail­wind for Asia’s growth in the post-pan­demic eco­nomic cy­cle.</p>
    <p>While the past four years have been a bruis­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for</p>
    <p>China with US tar­iffs and tech­nol­ogy re­stric­tions, this has ac­cel­er­ated its pur­suit of self-suf­fi­ciency in key sec­tors.</p>
    <p>More broadly, China’s on­go­ing ef­forts to re­bal­ance its econ­omy mean that do­mes­tic con­sump­tion will play a greater role in driv­ing its eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, un­der US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s lead­er­ship, we ex­pect the US to take a more mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proach to­wards US-China re­la­tions, which will re­sult in re­duced un­cer­tainty for Asian busi­nesses and in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, we see the healthy fun­da­men­tals and yield ad­van­tage of Asian emerg­ing mar­ket cur­ren­cies, pri­mar­ily the Chi­nese yuan, at­tract­ing global cap­i­tal flow, which will fur­ther con­trib­ute to long-term as­set price ap­pre­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially as in­ter­est rates in de­vel­oped mar­kets are ex­pected to stay near ul­tra-low lev­els for an ex­tended pe­riod, which will drive a struc­tural search for yield across the in­vest­ment land­scape.</p>
