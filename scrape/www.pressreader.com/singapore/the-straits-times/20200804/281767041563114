    <p>Hav­ing dodged the worst of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic so far with just 240 in­fec­tions to date, Cambodia is fac­ing struc­tural eco­nomic head­winds.</p>
    <p>On Aug 12, tar­iff ex­emp­tion on about €1 bil­lion (S$1.6 bil­lion) worth of Cambodia’s ex­ports to the Euro­pean Union will be with­drawn. In Oc­to­ber, the king­dom may also join the bloc’s black­list of coun­tries at risk of money laun­der­ing. And Cambodia’s econ­omy is pro­jected to shrink 1.9 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Yet, it will soon seal a free trade agree­ment (FTA) with China, its first with a ma­jor trad­ing part­ner. Bi­lat­eral ne­go­ti­a­tions which be­gan only in Jan­uary were con­cluded with much fan­fare last month. Prime Min­is­ter Hun Sen will at­tend the sign­ing cer­e­mony in Bei­jing this month, say of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>It’s a deal laden with strate­gic sig­nif­i­cance, given how the flar­ing con­fronta­tion be­tween the United States and China is putting smaller states in the re­gion like Myan­mar in an awk­ward po­si­tion. Mr Hun Sen, in con­trast, has made no se­cret about his al­le­giance. In Fe­bru­ary, he trav­elled to Bei­jing to show sol­i­dar­ity while the pan­demic sealed off Wuhan city.</p>
    <p>He has re­peat­edly de­nied claims that Cambodia plans to grant the Chi­nese mil­i­tary a base. Still, in March, amid a wave of re­gional re­stric­tions on cross-bor­der travel, Cambodia con­tin­ued to host Chi­nese troops in its an­nual bi­lat­eral mil­i­tary drill.</p>
    <p>“This free trade agree­ment is prob­a­bly driven more by po­lit­i­cal rather than eco­nomic im­per­a­tives,” Dr Jayant Menon, vis­it­ing se­nior fel­low at ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute, told The Straits Times. “China may be look­ing to shore up its al­lies in a re­gion grow­ing in­creas­ingly sus­pi­cious of its mo­tives as it pur­sues a more ag­gres­sive stance in re­la­tion to the South China Sea in par­tic­u­lar.”</p>
    <p>Ob­servers have noted that the trade deal ap­pears timed as a snub to the EU, which cited hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions for the par­tial with­drawal of ben­e­fits. But it’s not like the China deal can make up for it.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mist Ch­heng Kim­long, vice-pres­i­dent of think-tank Asian Vi­sion In­sti­tute, said: “It may com­pen­sate for some of the loss, but not that much.”</p>
    <p>The United States, EU and Ja­pan were Cambodia’s top ex­port des­ti­na­tions last year. China, in con­trast, was Cambodia’s top source of im­ports.</p>
    <p>Cambodia’s all-im­por­tant gar­ment sec­tor – now rav­aged by the pan­demic – pro­cessed raw ma­te­rial from China into prod­ucts that were shipped to third des­ti­na­tions such as the US and EU. Cambodia reg­is­tered a trade deficit of over US$6 bil­lion (S$8.3 bil­lion) with China last year.</p>
    <p>With China, of­fi­cials hope to boost Cam­bo­dian agri­cul­tural ex­ports such as rice, ba­nanas and cas­sava, as well as at­tract in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>While some may ar­gue that given the US-China trade war, this bi­lat­eral deal would en­cour­age “back­door” in­vest­ments in Cambodia for ex­port to the Chi­nese mar­ket, the prospects of that ap­pear slim and lim­ited to the agri­cul­ture sec­tor, noted Dr Menon.</p>
    <p>In the longer term though, th­ese for­eign in­vest­ments could help Cambodia move up the agri­cul­ture value chain. Dr Kim­long said: “The gov­ern­ment has re­cently been em­pha­sis­ing the sig­nif­i­cance of agri­cul­ture, and us­ing agri­cul­ture as the buf­fer for coun­ter­act­ing the eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic. The FTA aims to pro­mote in­vest­ment in this sec­tor, as well as prod­uct di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and mod­erni­sa­tion of the agri­cul­tural sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, it will likely take years for this deal to bear fruit, say an­a­lysts. In the mean­time, Ph­nom Penh and Bei­jing can bask in the new­est em­blem of their close ties.</p>
