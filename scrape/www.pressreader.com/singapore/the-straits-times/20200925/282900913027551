    <p>MUM­BAI • Bol­ly­wood su­per­star Deepika Padukone (above) has been sum­moned for ques­tion­ing as part of an es­ca­lat­ing drug probe into the sui­cide of ac­tor Sushant Singh Ra­jput, In­dian po­lice said late on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion has al­ready seen ac­tress Rhea Chakrabort­y ar­rested for al­legedly buy­ing drugs for her former boyfriend Ra­jput, who was found dead in June in his Mum­bai apart­ment.</p>
    <p>Po­lice have said the ac­tor, 34, took his own life.</p>
    <p>A star with many hit movies to his name, Ra­jput’s sui­cide trig­gered a de­bate on men­tal health in the multi­bil­lion-dol­lar Bol­ly­wood in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>But his fam­ily dis­puted re­ports that he had suf­fered from de­pres­sion and ac­cused Chakrabort­y, 28, of steal­ing his money and ha­rass­ing him. She has de­nied the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Ra­jput’s death has sparked a me­dia storm in In­dia, where calls have mounted for a wider probe into Bol­ly­wood’s so-called “drugs mafia”, with tele­vi­sion chan­nels spec­u­lat­ing that Chakrabort­y sup­pos­edly drove Ra­jput to sui­cide by pur­chas­ing cannabis for him.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s top anti-crime agency, the Cen­tral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, has been prob­ing his death since last month. The Nar­cotics Con­trol Bureau (NCB) was also look­ing into Ra­jput’s con­sump­tion of cannabis.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, TV chan­nel TimesNow broad­cast sec­tions of a What­sApp con­ver­sa­tion about procur­ing hash, al­leg­ing that the two peo­ple chat­ting were Padukone, 34, and her man­ager.</p>
    <p>K.P.S. Mal­ho­tra, deputy direc­tor of the NCB, said the agency had sum­moned Padukone as well as ac­tresses Sara Ali Khan, Shrad­dha Kapoor and Rakul Preet Singh for ques­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have al­ready de­tained oth­ers in con­nec­tion with the case, in­clud­ing Chakrabort­y’s brother and a mem­ber of Ra­jput’s house staff.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion has grabbed head­lines for months and some celebri­ties – in­clud­ing ac­tresses Vidya Balan and Sonam Kapoor – have ac­cused TV chan­nels of car­ry­ing out a “witch hunt” against Chakrabort­y.</p>
    <p>Born in the eastern state of Bi­har, Ra­jput quit his en­gi­neer­ing stud­ies to pur­sue a ca­reer in act­ing.</p>
    <p>He got his big break in 2013 with Kai Po Che, a film about cricket, love and pol­i­tics that won ac­claim at the Ber­lin film fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>He was also lauded for his por­trayal of In­dian cricket hero Ma­hen­dra Singh Dhoni in a hit 2016 biopic.</p>
