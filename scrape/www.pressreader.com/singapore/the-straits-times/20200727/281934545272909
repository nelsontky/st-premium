    <p>HANOI • A high school re­union trip in Viet­nam took a fa­tal turn yes­ter­day when a bus car­ry­ing the alumni crashed and flipped over at a bend on the high­way, killing more than a dozen pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The nearly 40 pas­sen­gers were class­mates from Dong Hoi High School who were trav­el­ling to visit the area in cen­tral Quang Binh prov­ince for the 30th an­niver­sary of their grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The bus driver lost con­trol on a sharp turn on the high­way, said state me­dia. At least 13 peo­ple were killed and many more in­jured.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple on the coach said that when the coach was trav­el­ling down the slope, there were signs the brakes were dam­aged,” re­ported Tuoi Tre news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Im­ages shared on news web­sites showed a bus on its side in a gut­ter by the road, with res­cuers tend­ing to the in­jured.</p>
