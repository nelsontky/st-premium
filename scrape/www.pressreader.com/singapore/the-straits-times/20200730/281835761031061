    <p>The Philip­pines now has more cases of Covid-19 than China, where the coron­avirus that causes this dis­ease was first re­ported, with the Health Min­istry re­port­ing that hos­pi­tals are al­ready “close to be­ing over­whelmed”.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines yes­ter­day recorded 1,874 new coron­avirus in­fec­tions, bring­ing its total to 85,486.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, ac­cord­ing to data gath­er­ing firm Worl­dome­ter, China had a total of 84,060.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia still has the most num­ber of in­fec­tions in South-east Asia, with 104,432, and thou­sands more have died in the coun­try and in China than in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>But with the high rate of in­fec­tions in the Philip­pines, and a gov­ern­ment more fo­cused on re­open­ing the econ­omy than slow­ing the spread of the virus, ex­perts from the state-run Univer­sity of the Philip­pines ex­pect the coun­try’s caseload to surge to 150,000 by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>More than half of the coun­try’s in­fec­tions sur­faced only in the past month, when most of the re­stric­tions of a sweep­ing, two-month­long lock­down were eased.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials said cases are spik­ing as more peo­ple are now go­ing to work or mak­ing more non-es­sen­tial for­ays out­side their homes.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics in­sist that the gov­ern­ment has failed to cap­i­talise on gains from the lock­down to come up with a mech­a­nism of mass test­ing, con­tact trac­ing and quick iso­la­tion of those with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte is said to be con­sid­er­ing re­in­stat­ing tough move­ment and so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions in Met­ro­pol­i­tan Manila.</p>
    <p>But his eco­nomic advisers are in­sist­ing that with over three mil­lion peo­ple out of work and most small busi­nesses fold­ing, the way to go is to re­open the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, gyms, In­ter­net cafes, tu­ition cen­tres, pet clin­ics and drive-in cin­e­mas were al­lowed to re­open.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials are con­cerned that if the rate of in­fec­tion re­mains at its cur­rent pace, the pub­lic health sys­tem will be over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal beds for Covid-19 pa­tients in Metro Manila are near­ing full ca­pac­ity, with four in five beds al­ready oc­cu­pied. Across the coun­try, more than half of the beds for Covid-19 pa­tients are in use.</p>
    <p>“Na­tion­ally, our health sys­tem might soon be over­whelmed,” said Health Un­der­sec­re­tary Rosario Vergeire, who has also called on hos­pi­tals to set aside more beds for Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral hos­pi­tals said last week that they had reached full ca­pac­ity for these pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A doc­tor told The Straits Times that a doc­tors’ Viber chat group was filled with mes­sages ask­ing where they can have a pa­tient ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>A doc­tor in a Metro Manila hos­pi­tal re­counted that he had to turn down five pa­tients on one day.</p>
    <p>In his an­nual ad­dress to the na­tion on Mon­day, Mr Duterte of­fered scant de­tails about how he in­tends to con­tain the surge in</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics said the core of his plan seems to be to just wait for China to come up with a vac­cine, and hope that the Philip­pines will be among the first coun­tries to get it.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Leni Ro­bredo, who heads the op­po­si­tion party, yes­ter­day said in a re­but­tal against Mr Duterte that in­stead of wish­ful think­ing and wait­ing for a vac­cine, “we have to start with col­lect­ing the right data”.</p>
    <p>“From here, we can de­ter­mine who and what places we should fo­cus on for mass test­ing, con­tact trac­ing and sup­port for com­mu­ni­ties and hos­pi­tals,” she said.</p>
