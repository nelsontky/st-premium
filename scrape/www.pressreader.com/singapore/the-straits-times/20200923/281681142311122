    <p>Q Are groups of more than five peo­ple al­lowed to split them­selves across mul­ti­ple ta­bles at F&B out­lets?</p>
    <p>A No. Gath­er­ings of more than five peo­ple are not al­lowed, even if they are split across mul­ti­ple ta­bles or in pri­vate din­ing rooms.</p>
    <p>F&B op­er­a­tors are not al­lowed to ac­cept such reser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>Q Can house­holds with more than five peo­ple liv­ing to­gether book more than one ta­ble at F&B out­lets?</p>
    <p>A Yes, they can. In this case, the group will be seated at mul­ti­ple ta­bles, at least 1m apart, with no more than five peo­ple per ta­ble.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Min­istry of Health said they should limit in­ter­ac­tion be­tween ta­bles.</p>
    <p>F&B es­tab­lish­ments can re­quest to ver­ify din­ers’ claims that they are from the same house­hold, and they can deny en­try to din­ers at their dis­cre­tion.</p>
    <p>Q Will din­ers be pe­nalised for flout­ing Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures?</p>
    <p>A Yes. Cus­tomers would have com­mit­ted an of­fence if they gath­ered in groups of more than five, mixed with peo­ple from other groups, failed to prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing or are not wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>First-time offenders will be fined $300, while a sec­ond of­fence will lead to a $1,000 fine or pros­e­cu­tion in court for more se­ri­ous cases.</p>
    <p>On Sept 9, 17 in­di­vid­u­als were fined for breach­ing the five-per­son rule at var­i­ous F&B out­lets.</p>
    <p>This came af­ter the Min­istry of Health’s an­nounce­ment on the same day that din­ers and F&B out­lets breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures, even for the first time, will be pe­nalised with­out warn­ing.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers would have com­mit­ted an of­fence if they gath­ered in groups of more than five, mixed with peo­ple from other groups, failed to prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing or are not wear­ing masks. First-time offenders will be fined $300, while a sec­ond of­fence will lead to a $1,000 fine or pros­e­cu­tion in court for more se­ri­ous cases. On Sept 9, 17 in­di­vid­u­als were fined for breach­ing the five-per­son rule at var­i­ous F&B out­lets.</p>
