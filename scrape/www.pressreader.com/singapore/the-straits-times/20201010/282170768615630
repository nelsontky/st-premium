    <p>Lo­cal shares joined most re­gional mar­kets to head south yes­ter­day and end a four-day rally that was largely fu­elled by a buoy­ant Wall Street and hopes of more fis­cal stim­u­lus in the United States.</p>
    <p>The more cau­tious mood sent the Straits Times In­dex (STI) down 10.15 points or 0.4 per cent to 2,532.96 but it still man­aged to notch up a 1.48 per cent gain over the week. Losers out­paced gain­ers 212 to 173 with 1.07 bil­lion shares worth $844.02 mil­lion traded.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel, in chalk­ing up a 0.93 per cent gain, was the STI’s top per­former, end­ing at $2.17. This came af­ter the telecomms com­pany said it had launched a 5G stand­alone trial net­work for en­ter­prises. Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings came in last on the STI per­for­mance ta­ble, slid­ing 1.9 per cent to US$21.15. Yangz­i­jiang Ship­build­ing was the most ac­tive STI stock with a trad­ing vol­ume of 20.3 mil­lion shares. It sank 1.52 per cent to 97.5 cents.</p>
    <p>Asian mar­kets were mixed.</p>
    <p>The Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex posted a 1.68 per cent gain af­ter an eight-day na­tional hol­i­day. It was lifted by gen­er­ally favourable data show­ing China re­cov­er­ing strongly from the pan­demic slow­down.</p>
    <p>Malaysian shares ad­vanced 0.72 per cent while Aus­tralia’s S&P/ASX 200 in­dex closed flat though it put on 5.4 per cent for the week to hit lev­els not seen since early last month.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 In­dex slid 0.12 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex de­clined a fur­ther 0.31 per cent, af­ter be­ing one of the few losers in Thurs­day’s re­gional mar­kets rally.</p>
    <p>The South Korean ex­change was closed for a hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Global in­vestor sen­ti­ment, which has been whip­sawed by chang­ing ex­pec­ta­tions of United States’ stim­u­lus moves, re­cov­ered af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said on Thurs­day that talks with Congress had restarted on tar­geted fis­cal re­lief.</p>
    <p>A softer US dol­lar, as in­vestors wa­ger on the like­li­hood of more stim­u­lus mea­sures if Democrats sweep the Nov 3 elec­tion, also aided the yuan and the re­gion. The yuan jumped 1.3 per cent to a 17-month high against the green­back.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an­a­lysts re­mained cau­tious about whether the strength in re­gional cur­ren­cies could en­dure.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know whether this rally could sus­tain, given the fact that we’re head­ing to­wards the US elec­tion and that there could be plenty of po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tain­ties down the road,” said Ms Mar­garet Yang, a Sin­ga­pore-based strate­gist at Dai­lyFX.</p>
