    <p>Vol­un­teers are like the low flame of sport, just there, qui­etly keep­ing sport alive but also oc­ca­sion­ally amus­ing us.</p>
    <p>A cam­era watches as a French driver thanks a Bahraini stranger for sav­ing his life. “You were the man that crossed the road?” he asks and then wraps his ban­daged hands in grat­i­tude around a masked vol­un­teer. Ro­main Gros­jean is meet­ing Ali Ta­her four days af­ter the mar­shal with his ex­tin­guisher helped res­cue him from a burn­ing car.</p>
    <p>Both men were do­ing their duty be­fore dis­as­ter con­nected them. One a driver, the other a mar­shal. One fa­mous, the other un­known. Both with­out whom sport can­not func­tion. One the heart, the other the back­bone.</p>
    <p>The skele­ton of sport is in plain view and yet un­seen. It is the per­son be­hind the old score­board. It’s the care­taker – like Uncle Koon in Alju­nied – giv­ing the bas­ket­ball court its daily shine. It’s the lady rak­ing the long jump pit at the school meet. The peo­ple who al­low sport to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>There is M. Jay­alaxmi, a teacher’s aide, whose zest for ath­let­ics is ev­i­dent in her voice and her CV: From lo­cal meets to Asian Games, it com­prises nearly 30 years of of­fi­ci­at­ing. So for­get that kid Roger Fed­erer, 39, she is 61 and still do­ing school com­pe­ti­tions and will tell you: “The drive is still there.”</p>
    <p>Some­one has to know what con­sti­tutes an il­le­gal javelin throw. How to mark a cy­cling route. What time the re­sults sheets will ap­pear. We take this for granted, but it is how sport is given an or­der. It’s a scaf­fold­ing with­out which com­pe­ti­tion could not hap­pen. If there is no wa­ter sta­tion, there is no marathon.</p>
    <p>This is a love for the game both un­pre­ten­tious and un­cel­e­brated. In the pelt­ing rain sail­ing buoys must be set for a race and in the hard sun the lines of a foot­ball field must be neatly marked. Some­one must cre­ate a can­vas for the artist.</p>
    <p>Then when the day is done, it must be packed away. Flags sorted. Pole vault bar stored. When Jay­alaxmi started, this ded­i­ca­tion was worth a $3 al­lowance, but who cares be­cause it’s not what she’s here for. It’s about her giv­ing time and her­self to a sport.</p>
    <p>The ath­lete takes the fame, the vol­un­teer is re­quired to be in­vis­i­ble. Part of the es­sen­tial fur­ni­ture of a grand the­atre. The only time we fo­cus on them is when a player in­volves them. When a par­ent on the side­line hurls in­vec­tive at a vol­un­teer um­pire or when David Nal­ban­dian kicks an ad­ver­tis­ing board which leaves a lines­man bleed­ing.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers are like the low flame of sport, just there, qui­etly keep­ing sport alive but also oc­ca­sion­ally amus­ing us. In Delhi, there was the leg­end of a Davis Cup lines­man who would call a foot fault on a ri­val player at an op­por­tune time.</p>
    <p>But sport also oc­ca­sion­ally ex­tracts a price from the vol­un­teer, an un­bear­ably high cost for pas­sion. Usu­ally it is in rac­ing where cars dis­in­te­grate and ev­ery fly­ing part turns into a weapon. A mar­shal was killed at the 2001 Aus­tralian Grand Prix by a wheel as was an­other in sim­i­lar fash­ion at the 2000 Ital­ian Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>A friend of a track mar­shal killed at the Canadian Grand Prix in</p>
    <p>2013, told the Canadian Press: “F1 for him was kind of like get­ting a chance to be a roadie for the</p>
    <p>Rolling Stones once a year.” It made per­fect sense for peo­ple will work as a cour­tesy car driver, or stand sen­try at a dress­ing room door, just for a close-up glance at the pri­vate ath­lete. Not the robot on court, but the weep­ing hu­man be­hind the cur­tain.</p>
    <p>Prox­im­ity brings ed­u­ca­tion. A friend, who vol­un­teered at the WTA Cham­pi­onships and SEA Games, found her­self as a wheel­chair as­sis­tant at the Asean Para Games. “Just to watch th­ese ath­letes over­come ob­sta­cles and find joy in com­pet­ing was hum­bling,” she said. “It was in­spir­ing to wit­ness the grace with which they lived life.”</p>
    <p>Other vol­un­teers pos­sess a weight of knowl­edge which they wish to re­turn to sport. Kazi Kazhirin, 28, once a com­pet­i­tive sailor, opted to vol­un­teer for many years, lend­ing a hand at ev­ery­thing from the Youth Olympic Games to monthly races. If flags had to be raised for the count­down to the start, he’d do it. If an­chors had to be raised, he was there. “I still wanted to be in touch,” he says.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers en­sure that sport re­tains a residue of sim­plic­ity. Amid in­flated salaries, they work for old-fash­ioned hon­o­rar­i­ums. While ev­ery­one scraps for sliv­ers of the lime­light, they do their work un­ac­knowl­edged. But they all have sto­ries and so next time you meet one, say hello and have a chat. Be­cause maybe it’ll be the man with the ex­tin­guisher.</p>
    <p>Or maybe it’ll be Jay­alaxmi. She started by re­triev­ing the shot put af­ter throws and now she’s an in­ter­na­tional starter for sprints. In ev­ery way it’s won­der­fully ap­pro­pri­ate. A grey­ing vol­un­teer with a start­ing pis­tol, telling the sport­ing world she calls the shots.</p>
    <p>The skele­ton of sport is in plain view and yet un­seen. It is the per­son be­hind the old score­board. It’s the care­taker – like Uncle Koon in Alju­nied – giv­ing the bas­ket­ball court its daily shine. It’s the lady rak­ing the long jump pit at the school meet. The peo­ple who al­low sport to hap­pen.</p>
