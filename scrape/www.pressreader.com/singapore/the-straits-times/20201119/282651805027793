    <p>The blue-and-white blocks on 37 Emer­ald Hill were once the site of Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Girls’ School. They now form a quaint back­drop to the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Pho­tog­ra­phy Fes­ti­val, where works by lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional artists will deck the walls till Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors wend­ing their way through the cor­ri­dors and old school­rooms will find plenty to savour – from pho­tog­ra­pher Bob Lee’s por­traits of fam­i­lies in Hous­ing Board flats; to Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts lec­turer Gilles Mas­sot’s re­jected slides (35mm trans­par­ent pos­i­tives).</p>
    <p>They can also leaf through a se­lec­tion of pho­to­books, and head to the out­door swim­ming pool and re­flect on Drowned And Tal­cum, Ar­gen­tinian-born artist Seba Kur­tis’ re­sponses to the death of refugees.</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial fes­ti­val, which is or­gan­ised by arts space Deck, is now in its sev­enth edition and fea­tures more than 70 artists from re­gions such as Asia, Europe and Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The main ex­hi­bi­tion venues are 37 Emer­ald Hill and Deck’s premises in Prin­sep Street, but art can also be found in the Es­planade Tun­nel and at seven Down­town Line MRT sta­tions.</p>
    <p>At New­ton MRT sta­tion, for in­stance, one can catch a glimpse of Calvin Chow’s The Blind­ness Of The Sea – which he em­barked on dur­ing a trip to Jakarta, the world’s fastest-sink­ing city. It is one of 31 artist port­fo­lios se­lected from hun­dreds of en­tries for an Open Call Show­case.</p>
    <p>Over at the ArtS­cience Mu­seum, the Mar­gins: Draw­ing Pic­tures Of Home ex­hi­bi­tion fea­tures 15 Sin­ga­pore pho­tog­ra­phers, from Nguan to Sim Chi Yin.</p>
    <p>There will also be guided tours on-site, as well as on­line events such as talks, di­a­logues and mas­ter­classes. The Walk With Pho­tog­ra­pher ini­tia­tive, too, will see five artists con­duct 360-de­gree on­line tours through parts of Sin­ga­pore – rang­ing from t wo sec­ondary forests to Joo Chiat – which had in­formed their work.</p>
    <p>Fes­ti­val di­rec­tor Gwen Lee says: “De­spite the chal­lenges this year, we hope to con­tinue our role as the re­gion’s lead­ing plat­form to dis­cover, nur­ture and pro­pel South­east Asian pho­tog­ra­phers onto the in­ter­na­tional stage. The fes­ti­val aims to in­tro­duce the art of pho­tog­ra­phy to the layper­son and pro­fes­sion­als alike.”</p>
    <p>This year’s theme of De­part­ing and Ar­riv­ing, cho­sen be­fore the pan­demic struck, takes on “a re­flec­tive ap­proach” and gets the au­di­ence to ex­plore no­tions of iden­tity and be­long­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee adds that some of the works at 37 Emer­ald Hill re­spond in­di­rectly to the his­tory of the venue as a for­mer girls’ school that was used as quar­ters for “com­fort women” dur­ing World War II. Among these works are Miyuki Okuyama’s Dear Ja­panese photodoc­u­men­tary, as well as Tai­wanese artist Hou I-ting’s String The­ory – Sewing Space, based partly on old pho­tos of school­girls from Tai­wan un­der Ja­panese rule.</p>
    <p>One of the new things this year is the Sil­vana S. Foun­da­tion Com­mis­sion Award, a $20,000 cash prize for Asia-Pa­cific pho­tog­ra­phers fo­cus­ing on en­vi­ron­men­tal, wildlife preser­va­tion and hu­man­i­tar­ian is­sues. At the open­ing cer­e­mony last week, the prize was awarded to Robert Zhao, who will present an ex­hi­bi­tion or­gan­ised by Sin­ga­pore’s Jada Art Gallery next year.</p>
