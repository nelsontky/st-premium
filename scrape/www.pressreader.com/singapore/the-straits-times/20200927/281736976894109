    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • For­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad said yes­ter­day that he would not be con­test­ing the gen­eral elec­tion if it is to be held in 2023, as he would be 98 years old then.</p>
    <p>He was quoted by Ber­nama news agency as say­ing that he would then be will­ing to of­fer ad­vice to the new party he has set up, Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air. But the 95-year-old states­man did not in­di­cate if he would stand in the elec­tion if it is held soon.</p>
    <p>The next gen­eral elec­tion is due in 2023, but there is wide­spread talk that it could be held in the next few months. The gov­ern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin has a slim ma­jor­ity i n the 222-seat Par­lia­ment, and last Wed­nes­day, op­po­si­tion chief An­war Ibrahim said he had enough MPs be­hind him to form a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Hours later, Datuk Seri Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, the pres­i­dent of Umno – a party al­lied to Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional – said “many” of his party’s law­mak­ers are sup­port­ing Datuk Seri An­war.</p>
    <p>Tun Dr Ma­hathir’s Pe­juang party has five MPs, in­clud­ing him­self. He has sub­mit­ted an ap­pli­ca­tion to reg­is­ter it.</p>
    <p>Asked by re­porters i n his con­stituency of Langkawi if there was a need to dis­solve Par­lia­ment for a gen­eral elec­tion to be held fol­low­ing the lat­est po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ment, Dr Ma­hathir said the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion posed a threat to the plan. “I am con­fi­dent that if the gen­eral elec­tion is held now, many peo­ple will be af­fected by Covid-19, many will die,” Ber­nama quoted him as say­ing. “The ques­tion is whether we give pri­or­ity to pol­i­tics or the peo­ple’s lives.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir did not in­di­cate if he would stand in the elec­tion if it is held soon. The next gen­eral elec­tion is due in 2023, but there is wide­spread talk it could be held in the next few months.</p>
