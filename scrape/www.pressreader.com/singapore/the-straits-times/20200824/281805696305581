    <p>Wak­ing up with cold sweats for a week in April dur­ing the pan­demic, Ms Bharati Kumar knew she needed a doc­tor. She made an ap­point­ment on a dig­i­tal health­care web­site and spoke on video to a doc­tor, who sent some­one to col­lect her blood sam­ples and pre­scribed anti-anx­i­ety pills and ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Ms Bharati, 50, called the ex­pe­ri­ence “weird and fu­tur­is­tic but easy”.</p>
    <p>Telemedici­ne could be­come more com­mon as In­dia gears up to dig­i­talise its cru­cial but ne­glected health sec­tor.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic lays bare un­fit state hos­pi­tals, se­vere doc­tor short­ages and gaps in hos­pi­tal ac­cess, the In­dian govern­ment has turned to dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy and pri­vate play­ers to treat these chronic af­flic­tions.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has sped up a na­tional dig­i­tal health pro­gramme launched in Jan­uary. In March, the govern­ment re­leased guide­lines for telemedici­ne. This month, in his In­de­pen­dence Day speech, Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi an­nounced a na­tional health iden­ti­fi­ca­tion for ci­ti­zens. Fledg­ling start-ups are gear­ing up to grow big and fast.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment’s ar­tic­u­la­tion makes (dig­i­tal health­care) main­stream. It will draw more pri­vate in­vest­ment and make health­care more in­clu­sive,” said Mr Prashant Tan­don, co-founder of 1mg Tech­nolo­gies, a health­care app.</p>
    <p>In a coun­try where only 1 per cent of GDP is spent on pub­lic health­care, and one govern­ment doc­tor at­tends to more than 11,000 peo­ple on av­er­age, com­pa­nies say dig­i­tal health is the only way to reach more peo­ple. But In­di­ans who most need re­mote health­care – the el­derly, the un­e­d­u­cated and ru­ral poor – are also the hard­est to reach dig­i­tally. Com­pa­nies face ques­tions of how they will scale, pro­vide qual­ity di­ag­no­sis and se­cure health data.</p>
    <p>Tech de­vel­op­ers from iSPIRT, a pri­vate tech lobby group of the big­gest In­dian pri­vate tech play­ers, are now build­ing the dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture – a “na­tional health stack” – that start-ups can build on. The pro­gramme is over­seen by govern­ment think-tank Niti Aayog and the Na­tional Health Au­thor­ity, a state body tasked with de­liv­er­ing univer­sal health­care.</p>
    <p>The health stack will have reg­istries of cer­ti­fied doc­tors and test­ing labs, elec­tronic health records of pa­tients, gate­ways to make and claim pay­ments and, even­tu­ally, “health an­a­lyt­ics”.</p>
    <p>The In­dian govern­ment sees it as a har­bour to launch a thou­sand ehealth­care start-ups, but the sea ahead is choppy. More than one mil­lion chemists, al­most 60,000 hos­pi­tals and over 800,000 doc­tors will have to be brought on­line, and their pa­tient data col­lected dig­i­tally and stan­dard­ised.</p>
    <p>“I’ve seen hos­pi­tals with 200 to 300 beds in small towns that don’t have a sin­gle com­puter. Get­ting them to adopt dig­i­tal health is a tall ask,” said Mr Rajat Garg, co-founder of myUpchar.com, a dig­i­tal health­care firm that works in ru­ral In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Lalitesh Ka­tra­gadda, an en­tre­pre­neur help­ing to build the na­tional health stack, ad­mit­ted it will be a long haul. The first wave will be tele­con­sul­ta­tion. “Once the in­fra­struc­ture to get pa­tient con­sent be­comes bet­ter, telemedici­ne will take about three years to ma­ture. Then it may be e-phar­ma­cies, and then, in 10 to 15 years, the sci-fi stuff can start.”</p>
    <p>The sci-fi stuff in­cludes cre­at­ing per­sonal his­to­ries of “biomark­ers”,</p>
    <p>In a coun­try where only 1 per cent of GDP is spent on pub­lic health­care, and one govern­ment doc­tor at­tends to more than 11,000 peo­ple on av­er­age, com­pa­nies say dig­i­tal health is the only way to reach more peo­ple.

    <p>or mea­sur­able med­i­cal signs like blood pres­sure and pulse rates, from birth to death; us­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence for In­dia – and eth­nic­ity-spe­cific med­i­cal anal­y­sis; and ge­netic and en­zyme break­down for tar­geted di­ag­noses.</p>
    <p>Hur­dles abound. Mr Ka­tra­gadda il­lus­trated one: “IDs used and data col­lected to­day have to be re­cov­er­able five to seven decades later.”</p>
    <p>Mr Garg of­fered an­other: Stan­dards of ac­cepted med­i­cal terms are all in English, while In­di­ans treat and ex­press ill­nesses in hun­dreds of lan­guages.</p>
    <p>Health­care tech con­sul­tant Pramod Ja­cob said: “The cur­rent ar­chi­tec­ture is be­ing de­signed un­der Covid in a hurry... The ma­jor fo­cus is on claims and billing, with­out due fo­cus on clin­i­cal data col­lected in a way that med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als can use it.” Dr Ja­cob said that scans of med­i­cal re­ports and pho­tos of hand­writ­ten pre­scrip­tions may help process in­sur­ance claims but would not aid clin­i­cal anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>When Ms Bharati vis­ited a physi­cian in per­son in June, he told her she had just re­cov­ered from malaria. He took her off the anti-anx­i­ety pills, call­ing them un­nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Jaipur-based pathol­o­gist Ro­hit Jain, who sought a court ban on Covid-19 test­ing by e-health­care firms, said: “Do doc­tor-pa­tient eth­i­cal prin­ci­ples ap­ply to these third par­ties? They are e-com­merce en­ti­ties... It is il­le­gal for them to col­lect med­i­cal sam­ples and is­sue test re­ports on their let­ter­heads, but they all do it.”</p>
    <p>In­dia has gone on­line nearly overnight be­fore, for on­line pay­ments, when the govern­ment ef­fec­tively re­moved 85 per cent of cur­rency notes in 2018. The pan­demic may be to e-health­care what de­mon­eti­sa­tion was to dig­i­tal pay­ments. But there are more clin­ics, chemists and labs than banks and they are more un­or­gan­ised.</p>
    <p>Health data is also more lay­ered and sen­si­tive. The govern­ment in­sists that, in the dig­i­tal health sys­tem, the data is owned by only the pa­tient. But in the ab­sence of a data pro­tec­tion law in In­dia, there is lit­tle ac­count­abil­ity for pri­vacy vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has forced many In­di­ans like Ms Bharati to ex­pe­ri­ence the fragility of the coun­try’s health­care sys­tem. They would hope that any pre­scrip­tion would first do no harm.</p>
