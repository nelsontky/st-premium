    <p>France’s In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin said yes­ter­day that more mil­i­tant at­tacks on its soil were likely and the coun­try was en­gaged in a war against Is­lamist ide­ol­ogy fol­low­ing the sec­ond deadly knife at­tack in its cities in two weeks. “We are in a war against an en­emy that is both in­side and out­side,” Mr Dar­manin told RTL ra­dio. “We need to un­der­stand that there have been and there will be other events such as th­ese ter­ri­ble at­tacks.”</p>
    <p>France’s In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin said yes­ter­day more mil­i­tant at­tacks on its soil were likely and the coun­try was en­gaged in a war against Is­lamist ide­ol­ogy fol­low­ing the sec­ond deadly knife at­tack in its cities in two weeks.</p>
    <p>“We are in a war against an en­emy that is both in­side and out­side,” Mr Dar­manin told RTL ra­dio.</p>
    <p>“We need to un­der­stand that there have been and there will be other events such as th­ese ter­ri­ble at­tacks.”</p>
    <p>Mr Dar­manin was speak­ing a day af­ter an as­sailant shout­ing “Al­lahu Ak­bar” (“God is great­est”) be­headed a woman and killed two other peo­ple in a church in Nice.</p>
    <p>The man was shot by po­lice and is in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>His com­ments came as tens of thou­sands of Mus­lims protested in Pak­istan, Bangladesh and the Pales­tinian ter­ri­to­ries yes­ter­day af­ter the killings in a French church prompted a vow from Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron to stand firm against at­tacks on French val­ues and free­dom of be­lief.</p>
    <p>Thurs­day’s at­tack, on the birth­day of Prophet Muham­mad, took place at a time of grow­ing Mus­lim anger across the globe at France’s de­fence of the right to pub­lish car­toons de­pict­ing the Prophet.</p>
    <p>France has warned its cit­i­zens they face a se­cu­rity risk “ev­ery­where” in the world in the wake of the at­tack, For­eign Min­is­ter JeanYves Le Drian said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron has re­fused to back down. “If we’re at­tacked, once again, it’s for our val­ues, our taste for lib­erty, the pos­si­bil­ity on our soil to be­lieve freely,” he said on Thurs­day, af­ter speak­ing to po­lice and emer­gency staff at the NotreDame basil­ica in Nice.</p>
    <p>“We will give up noth­ing.”</p>
    <p>The French Pres­i­dent has in­creased the num­ber of sol­diers mo­bilised for in­ter­nal se­cu­rity oper­a­tion Sen­tinelle to 7,000 from 3,000 to pro­tect im­por­tant sites such as places of wor­ship and schools.</p>
    <p>He was set to con­vene a se­cu­rity Cab­i­net yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>France’s chief anti-ter­ror­ism prose­cu­tor said the man sus­pected of car­ry­ing out the Nice at­tack was a Tu­nisian born in 1999 who had ar­rived in Europe on Sept 20 in Lampe­dusa, the Ital­ian is­land off Tu­nisia that is a main land­ing point for mi­grants from Africa.</p>
    <p>A Tu­nisian se­cu­rity source and a French po­lice source named the sus­pect as Brahim Aouis­saoui.</p>
    <p>A French ju­di­cial source said yes­ter­day that a 47-year-old man had been taken into cus­tody on Thurs­day evening on sus­pi­cion of hav­ing been in con­tact with the per­pe­tra­tor of the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in Pak­istan, po­lice fired tear gas at thou­sands of demon­stra­tors march­ing to­wards the French Em­bassy in Islamabad.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands staged a sim­i­lar march through Dhaka, chant­ing “Boy­cott French prod­ucts” and car­ry­ing ban­ners call­ing Mr Macron “the world’s big­gest ter­ror­ist”.</p>
    <p>In a Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity district of In­dia’s fi­nan­cial hub Mum­bai, some 100 posters show­ing Mr Macron with a boot on his face and call­ing him a “de­mon” were pasted on pave­ments and roads.</p>
    <p>Protests were also held i n Afghanista­n, Le­banon, the Pales­tinian ter­ri­to­ries and So­ma­lia.</p>
    <p>But sev­eral lead­ers ex­pressed sup­port for France.</p>
    <p>“It is just the most cal­lous and cow­ardly and vi­cious act of bar­barism by ter­ror­ists and should be con­demned in the strong­est pos­si­ble way,” said Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son.</p>
    <p>In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi also voiced sup­port for Mr Macron’s po­si­tion and con­demned the vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions hu­man rights chief Michelle Bachelet de­cried yes­ter­day the “vi­cious” at­tacks in France, but urged po­lit­i­cal lead­ers to take a hard stance against “hate speech”.</p>
    <p>The high­est au­thor­ity on Is­lam in Sin­ga­pore, Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, has con­demned the re­cent mur­ders in the French cities of Paris and Nice.</p>
    <p>“Once again, rad­i­cal el­e­ments and ex­trem­ists have com­mit­ted heinous crimes on in­no­cent in­di­vid­u­als and in the most sa­cred of places,” he said in a let­ter to lead­ers of Sin­ga­pore’s Chris­tian com­mu­nity yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Such at­tacks are not only an af­front to the sa­cred­ness of the hu­man soul, but also an as­sault on Is­lam, as they took place in the month where Mus­lims com­mem­o­rate the birth of Prophet Muham­mad by hon­our­ing him with good deeds and be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese ter­ror­ists may have sought to ex­ploit our love for the Prophet to gain sym­pa­thy, but their ac­tions are a clear des­e­cra­tion of his teach­ings and have no place what­so­ever in Is­lam or in any re­li­gion.”</p>
    <p>On Oct 16, 47-year-old his­tory teacher Sa­muel Paty was be­headed by 18-year-old Ab­dul­lakh An­zorov in Paris. The at­tacker, who was later shot dead by the po­lice, had said he wanted to pun­ish Mr Paty for show­ing stu­dents car­toons of the Prophet in a civics les­son.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, a knife-wield­ing Tu­nisian man, be­lieved to be a Mus­lim, be­headed a woman and killed two oth­ers in a church in Nice be­fore be­ing caught by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dr Nazirudin said it is im­por­tant that Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety re­mains com­mit­ted to shared val­ues and to en­sur­ing that peace and har­mony pre­vail.</p>
    <p>He also said the Mus­lim com­mu­nity here will con­tinue to work tire­lessly with the Chris­tian com­mu­nity to af­firm their com­mit­ment to “the bonds of faith and friend­ship”.</p>
    <p>“We are con­fi­dent that by strength­en­ing the trust and con­fi­dence in each other, we will be able to pre­vent such in­ci­dents from ever tak­ing place here,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We of­fer our sin­cer­est prayers and sol­i­dar­ity to those whose lives were taken un­justly, to those who were in­jured and to their loved ones.”</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and Na­tional Devel­op­ment Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim also con­demned the at­tacks, say­ing they “have no place in Is­lam”.</p>
    <p>He added that all Sin­ga­pore­ans must “stand united and firmly” against any form of ex­trem­ist vi­o­lence and hate speech. “This is how we can con­tinue to main­tain a strong and co­he­sive so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>AN AF­FRONT TO THE HU­MAN SOUL</p>
    <p>Once again, rad­i­cal el­e­ments and ex­trem­ists have com­mit­ted heinous crimes on in­no­cent in­di­vid­u­als and in the most sa­cred of places. Such at­tacks are not only an af­front to the sa­cred­ness of the hu­man soul, but also an as­sault on Is­lam, as they took place in the month where Mus­lims com­mem­o­rate the birth of Prophet Muham­mad by hon­our­ing him with good deeds and be­hav­iour.</p>
