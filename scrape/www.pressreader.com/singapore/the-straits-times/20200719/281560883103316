    <p>Grand­mother Choy Wai Chee has more rea­son than most to cel­e­brate her birth­day to­day given she has been in a life-and-death fight against Covid-19 for the past four months.</p>
    <p>At one point, doc­tors told her dis­tressed fam­ily they had to be pre­pared for her demise.</p>
    <p>But she pulled through and marks her 58th birth­day to­day in the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH), where she is its longest­stay­ing Covid-19 pa­tient.</p>
    <p>Madam Choy was in high spir­its when The Sun­day Times vis­ited yes­ter­day, even though she was un­able to talk for long as she had a tube in her throat.</p>
    <p>She ges­tic­u­lated an­i­mat­edly and con­versed by writ­ing her re­sponses on a piece of pa­per, not­ing: “Doc­tors saved me.”</p>
    <p>Madam Choy, who was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 af­ter re­turn­ing from over­seas in March, said she was “not scared” of be­ing in hos­pi­tal as she had spent a year in one when she was 12 to fix her curved spine.</p>
    <p>“Hos­pi­tal is like my sec­ond home,” she joked, adding that she has also given birth four times. Her chil­dren are aged be­tween 19 and 31 and she has a two-year-old grand­daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>It was her curved spine that con­trib­uted, in part, to the “se­vere man­i­fes­ta­tion” of the dis­ease, said Dr See Kay Choong, a se­nior con­sul­tant with NUH’s di­vi­sion of res­pi­ra­tory and crit­i­cal care.</p>
    <p>The bent spine has re­sulted in Madam Choy hav­ing smaller lungs, which caused her to suf­fer from a more se­vere lung dis­ease.</p>
    <p>She was trans­ferred to NUH from Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal on March 31 as she was one of the few Covid-19 pa­tients whose con­di­tion de­te­ri­o­rated even af­ter be­ing put on a me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tor.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal then put her on a more in­ten­sive breath­ing sup­port sys­tem called the ex­tra­cor­po­real mem­brane oxy­gena­tion (ECMO).</p>
    <p>The ECMO ma­chine takes over the role of the dis­eased lung and ar­ti­fi­cially oxy­genates the blood out­side the body. Madam Choy is one of five Covid-19 pa­tients who have been put on ECMO.</p>
    <p>A team of more than 50 med­i­cal and paramed­i­cal per­son­nel, in­clud­ing in­ten­sive care unit nurses and per­fu­sion­ists who ran the ECMO ma­chine, had tended to Madam Choy, but ini­tially it seemed that she was not re­spond­ing well to treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The virus caused her liver, heart and kid­neys to dys­func­tion and Madam Choy was also bleed­ing con­tin­u­ously from the nu­mer­ous tubes that were at­tached to help her breathe.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Kollengode Ramanathan, a se­nior con­sul­tant with NUH’s de­part­ment of car­diac, tho­racic and vas­cu­lar surgery, re­called the mo­ment he had to tell Madam Choy’s hus­band that she might not make it.</p>
    <p>“When I broke the news about her crit­i­cal state, say­ing that she might die, her hus­band ac­tu­ally broke down. It was very dif­fi­cult to con­sole him over the phone,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Ramanathan added that he was re­minded of just how dire a state Madam Choy had been in when he saw her hus­band dur­ing a sur­prise birth­day cel­e­bra­tion the hos­pi­tal staff threw for her on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the birth­day cake cut­ting... He was in tears that... he could see her alive (and well) again,” said Prof Ramanathan.</p>
    <p>Madam Choy’s birth­day wish is to fully re­cover and be dis­charged, which could hap­pen around the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>She said she plans to “eat a lot” when she is well, list­ing won­ton noo­dles, chee cheong fun and dim sum as some of the treats she has missed the most.</p>
    <p>For now, fight­ing “bore­dom” is her big­gest prob­lem in hos­pi­tal. She used to work full time in the Agency for In­te­grated Care and is not used to hav­ing so much time on her hands.</p>
    <p>Madam Choy whiles away her time sewing face masks for her grand­daugh­ter and do­ing other as­sorted hand­i­crafts.</p>
    <p>“I want to re­cover faster, I can­not rely on (my doc­tors and nurses) so much, I want to do things my­self,” she said, adding that a strong de­sire to see her fam­ily mem­bers gath­ered to­gether again is spurring her on.</p>
    <p>Her fam­ily have been vis­it­ing her, but are re­stricted from gath­er­ing due to a cap on vis­i­tor num­bers.</p>
    <p>There is an­other spe­cial day to look for­ward to as well, with a grand­son due in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>As Madam Choy says: “If you want to live longer, you have to fight.”</p>
    <p>FIGHT­ING TO LIVE</p>
    <p>I want to re­cover faster, I can­not rely on (my doc­tors and nurses) so much, I want to do things my­self... If you want to live longer, you have to fight. ’’</p>
    <p>MADAM CHOY WAI CHEE, who has been bat­tling Covid-19 for the past four months. HUS­BAND’S RE­AC­TION</p>
    <p>When I broke the news about her crit­i­cal state, say­ing that she might die, her hus­band ac­tu­ally broke down, it was very dif­fi­cult to con­sole him over the phone... Dur­ing the birth­day cake cut­ting... He was in tears that... he could see her alive (and ’’ well) again.</p>
    <p>AS­SIS­TANT PRO­FES­SOR KOLLENGODE RAMANATHAN, on telling Madam Choy’s hus­band about her con­di­tion ear­lier on, and see­ing him at her birth­day cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
