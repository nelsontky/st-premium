    <p>With just days be­fore the start of 2021, many are hunt­ing for plan­ners, di­aries and desk cal­en­dars for the new year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it may be harder this year to get hold of a desk cal­en­dar, which is usu­ally given out as a cor­po­rate gift or mailed to house­holds by com­pa­nies hop­ing to pro­mote their brands.</p>
    <p>In a year marked by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, prin­ters are cut­ting down on their out­put of desk cal­en­dars due to lower de­mand from com­pa­nies try­ing to re­duce spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Seven out of nine print­ing com­pa­nies in­ter­viewed by The Straits Times said they are print­ing fewer desk cal­en­dars for next year, as com­pa­nies are not or­der­ing as many as be­fore.</p>
    <p>Ms Fizza Bhaimeya, owner of In­fin­ity Zap and Print Ser­vices, said that while the com­pany used to pro­duce desk cal­en­dars for seven to eight com­pa­nies an­nu­ally, there were “zero” cor­po­rate or­ders this year.</p>
    <p>She at­trib­uted it to more work­ing from home this year and hence not need­ing the cal­en­dars.</p>
    <p>An­other print­ing com­pany told The Straits Times off the record that its or­ders of desk cal­en­dars for the new year had dropped to about half com­pared with last year, due to fewer peo­ple work­ing in of­fices.</p>
    <p>While full-time in­vestor Peter Lim, 59, typ­i­cally re­ceives two to three cal­en­dars from banks and in­sur­ance agents in the mail ev­ery year, he did not re­ceive any this year.</p>
    <p>For the new year, he will be us­ing a desk cal­en­dar given by his neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim has been us­ing desk cal­en­dars since the late 1980s.</p>
    <p>“Back then, there was no com­puter or mo­bile phone, so I used desk cal­en­dars to keep track of my sched­ule,” he says.</p>
    <p>But he is re­signed to the fact that they will one day be­come ob­so­lete.</p>
    <p>“With a desk cal­en­dar, you can see one whole month of ac­tiv­ity at a glance. This is bet­ter than us­ing the cal­en­dar on the phone, where you have to press dif­fer­ent but­tons to view each day’s ac­tiv­i­ties,” he says.</p>
    <p>“It’s un­avoid­able that desk cal­en­dars will be re­placed by dig­i­tal cal­en­dars in time – but un­til then, I will con­tinue us­ing desk cal­en­dars if I re­ceive them. ”</p>
