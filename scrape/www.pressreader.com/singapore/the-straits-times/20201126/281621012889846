    <p>BUENOS AIRES • Diego Maradona, ar­guably the best foot­ball player ever whose wild swings in for­tune came to per­son­ify the flux of his home na­tion Ar­gentina, has died. He was 60.</p>
    <p>Maradona suf­fered a heart at­tack in Ti­gre, Buenos Aires, af­ter un­der­go­ing surgery to re­move a blood clot from his brain ear­lier this month, ac­cord­ing to the Clarin news­pa­per yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing to star­dom from a grimy Buenos Aires slum to lead Ar­gentina to World Cup vic­tory, Maradona was a rags-to-riches story in his foot­ball-mad home­land and gained the iconic sta­tus of fel­low Ar­gen­tines Che Gue­vara and Eva Peron.</p>
    <p>One of the most gifted foot­ball play­ers in his­tory, Maradona’s pin­na­cle of glory came when he cap­tained Ar­gentina to win the World Cup in 1986 be­fore plung­ing to mis­ery when he was kicked out of the 1994 World Cup for dop­ing.</p>
    <p>Years of drug use, overeat­ing and al­co­holism trun­cated a stel­lar ca­reer and al­tered his ap­pear­ance from the lithe ath­lete who could slalom ef­fort­lessly through teams to a bloated ad­dict who nearly died of co­caine-in­duced heart fail­ure in 2000.</p>
    <p>But he rein­vented him­self in a stun­ning come­back in 2008 as coach of the Ar­gentina team, per­suad­ing man­agers that with sheer charisma he could in­spire the team to vic­tory, de­spite a lack of coach­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>A ma­gi­cian with the ball – de­cep­tively quick and a vi­sion­ary passer – Maradona is con­sid­ered by some as the great­est foot­ball player ever, edg­ing out that other great, Brazil’s Pele.</p>
    <p>Pele, 80, mourned the pass­ing of Maradona af­ter the news broke.</p>
    <p>“Cer­tainly, one day we’ll kick a ball to­gether in the sky above,” he said in a brief state­ment pro­vided to Reuters by a rep­re­sen­ta­tive.</p>
    <p>Dis­cov­ered in street kick­abouts by the scout for first divi­sion club Ar­genti­nos Ju­niors, Maradona made his league de­but at 15.</p>
    <p>Born on Oct 30, 1960 in the Buenos Aires work­ing class sub­urb of Lanus, Maradona grew up in the Villa Fior­ito shanty town. He was the fifth of eight chil­dren of a fac­tory worker.</p>
