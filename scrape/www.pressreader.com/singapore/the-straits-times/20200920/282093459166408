    <p>LON­DON • Gareth Bale will not make a fairy-tale dou­ble home­com­ing at Southamp­ton today, with the for­ward not ex­pected to make his sec­ond Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur de­but un­til next month.</p>
    <p>The Tele­graph re­ported his med­i­cal test re­vealed he has a mi­nor knee in­jury and would likely make his Premier League bow against West Ham United only on Oct 17.</p>
    <p>The in­jury is not ex­pected to af­fect the com­ple­tion of his loan deal, with Spurs pay­ing £220,000 (S$386,500) of his £600,000-aweek Real Madrid wages.</p>
    <p>As the 31-year-old did not have a pre-sea­son with the La Liga cham­pi­ons and has been re­stricted to limited min­utes in re­cent years, Spurs had al­ready fac­tored in the pos­si­bil­ity that it could take Bale up to four weeks to be match ready.</p>
    <p>Bale broke into Southamp­ton’s first team in 2006, then starred for Spurs, earn­ing him a world-record €100 mil­lion (S$161 mil­lion) move to Real in 2013.</p>
    <p>Jose Mour­inho will be hop­ing Bale can carry some of Harry Kane’s scor­ing bur­den af­ter fail­ing to sign Saints striker Danny Ings.</p>
    <p>The Spurs man­ager will in­stead have to de­vise a plan to stop Ings, Saints’ top scorer with 25 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions last sea­son, when his side visit St Mary’s today.</p>
    <p>“Ings is a threat,” Mour­inho said of the match-win­ner when the sides met in this fix­ture last sea­son. “He is a player that scores a lot of goals. Ev­ery time he plays against us, he gives us a lot of prob­lems. He is a player we have to re­spect.”</p>
    <p>There are other sub­plots in the lat­est meet­ing, with for­mer Saints cap­tain Pierre-Emile Ho­jb­jerg and Spurs de­fender Kyle Walker-Peters set to face their old clubs.</p>
    <p>Southamp­ton boss Ralph Hasen­huttl said Walker-Peters, 23, is ea­ger to ad­just to a new style of play.</p>
    <p>“I think he has shown here that he is on the ball a very, very good right-back,” said Hasen­huttl. “We have a dif­fer­ent way of de­fend­ing (to Spurs), more on the front foot... in the be­gin­ning he strug­gled a lit­tle bit. But... he has made good progress so far.”</p>
