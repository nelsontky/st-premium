    <p>A semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pany de­cided to mark its 100th board meet­ing yes­ter­day by do­nat­ing $100,000 to The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF).</p>
    <p>Sil­i­con Man­u­fac­tur­ing Part­ners (SMP) chose to donate to STSPMF this year as part of ef­forts to sup­port the SG Cares Giv­ing Week cam­paign, which ends on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>SMP, which was formed in 1997, is a joint ven­ture be­tween semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ers Glob­alFoundrie­s Sin­ga­pore and Broad­com, and it op­er­ates a wafer fab­ri­ca­tion plant in Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, Glob­alFoundrie­s had lent its sup­port to char­i­ties like the Chil­dren’s Can­cer Foun­da­tion, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>SMP chair­man Ang Kay Chai said the com­pany do­nated to STSPMF this year as it was im­pressed with the fund’s ef­forts.</p>
    <p>SMP also shared the fund’s com­mit­ment to en­sur­ing chil­dren and youth from dis­ad­van­taged homes get the help they need, he added.</p>
    <p>STSPMF each year dis­burses</p>
    <p>more than $6 mil­lion to 10,000 ben­e­fi­cia­ries – from pri­mary school pupils to stu­dents in the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion, ju­nior col­leges and poly­tech­nics.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang said: “We want to en­sure that chil­dren in need have the ca­pa­bil­ity to achieve the best for them­selves and give back to the com­mu­nity in the fu­ture.” He added that more than ever, STSPMF ben­e­fi­cia­ries are in need of help, given the chal­lenges brought on by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang called on more peo­ple and or­gan­i­sa­tions to come for­ward to get in­volved in char­i­ta­ble work and help those who are in need.</p>
    <p>STSPMF gen­eral man­ager Tan Bee Heong said the fund was thank­ful to re­ceive the do­na­tion and to have a new part­ner join its cause. “We are very blessed to see such gen­eros­ity de­spite the tough eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion we are in,” she said.</p>
