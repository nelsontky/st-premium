    <p>Char­i­ties will re­ceive sup­port to boost their dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and strengthen reg­u­la­tory com­pli­ance and trans­parency, with a num­ber of ini­tia­tives to be rolled out later this year.</p>
    <p>They in­clude a new toolkit, which will be ready in Novem­ber, to help char­i­ties em­brace dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion as sup­port for their cor­po­rate and ad­min­is­tra­tive func­tions.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing yes­ter­day at the vir­tual Char­ity Gov­er­nance Con­fer­ence, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong said the Char­i­ties GoDig­i­tal Kit is one of three ini­tia­tives to strengthen the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of char­i­ties amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing char­i­ties as the glue that holds Sin­ga­pore to­gether, the min­is­ter said they play a key role in civil so­ci­ety that ben­e­fits the most vul­ner­a­ble seg­ments of the so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“Much of your work is in fact crit­i­cal to our national drive to build a more car­ing and in­clu­sive Sin­ga­pore,” Mr Tong told about 500 char­ity rep­re­sen­ta­tives and part­ners at the two-day con­fer­ence which is be­ing held vir­tu­ally for the first time.</p>
    <p>The con­fer­ence is or­gan­ised by the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) with sup­port from the Char­ity Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong also an­nounced a re­vised Char­ity Trans­parency Frame­work, to be pub­lished next month.</p>
    <p>Trans­parency, as with ac­count­abil­ity, is key in build­ing trust with donors and stake­hold­ers, he said.</p>
    <p>“The more well gov­erned a char­ity is, the more con­fi­dence a donor will have in that char­ity,” he stressed. “This frame­work serves as a guide to</p>
    <p>help char­i­ties de­fine their pol­icy and ap­proach to trans­parency... It will out­line good dis­clo­sure prac­tices, and help char­i­ties com­mu­ni­cate bet­ter with their stake­hold­ers.”</p>
    <p>The frame­work was launched in</p>
    <p>2015, and the re­vi­sion was an­nounced last year.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth said the frame­work, to be pub­lished on the Char­ity Por­tal and the</p>
    <p>Char­ity Coun­cil web­site, has been re­designed to suit char­i­ties of dif­fer­ent sizes.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong also an­nounced that four more or­gan­i­sa­tions will be help­ing to strengthen char­i­ties’ reg­u­la­tory com­pli­ance and ef­fec­tive­ness, start­ing yes­ter­day. These shared ser­vices part­ners will do it at low or no cost.</p>
    <p>They are the In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore Char­tered Ac­coun­tants, Law So­ci­ety Pro Bono Ser­vices, the In­sti­tute of In­ter­nal Au­di­tors Sin­ga­pore, and Shared Ser­vices for Char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This brings to 11 the or­gan­i­sa­tions which are help­ing char­i­ties to ac­cess IT so­lu­tions, re­cruit tal­ent and file an­nual re­ports and fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong added that his min­istry will con­tinue to work with part­ners and pro­vide re­sources to strengthen the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of char­i­ties and build a “more thriv­ing and re­silient” char­ity sec­tor.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties Ang Hak Seng said char­i­ties should not only look at in­creas­ing do­na­tions, but also spend time to im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“We also want you to deepen your pro­fes­sional core – I al­ways say, do what you do best, out­source the rest,” he said, adding that work­ing with the shared ser­vices part­ners would en­able char­i­ties to fo­cus more on their ac­tiv­i­ties and pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Char­ity Coun­cil chair­man Ger­ard Ee said that dur­ing this chal­leng­ing pe­riod, “char­i­ties need to in­crease the con­fi­dence in their donors, to share with them the good work that char­i­ties are do­ing, and to gar­ner more sup­port for your ef­forts to help ben­e­fi­cia­ries”.</p>
