    <p>In­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion is an im­por­tant en­abler for lo­cal small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) to scale up and grow (Help­ing home-grown firms com­pete glob­ally ben­e­fits S’pore­ans:</p>
    <p>Chan, Nov 25). What kind of strate­gies do suc­cess­ful SMEs use to grow, and what con­straints pre­vent growth?</p>
    <p>In his au­to­bi­og­ra­phy, the late former South African pres­i­dent Nel­son Man­dela re­called his dis­may when he boarded a plane and found that the pi­lot was African, be­cause he had never seen an African pi­lot be­fore. He quickly re­alised that his re­ac­tion was ex­actly the sort of im­plicit bias and prej­u­dice that he had been cham­pi­oning against all his life.</p>
    <p>The same im­plicit bias and prej­u­dice sur­face in the world of com­merce – the self-de­feat­ing mind­set and ac­com­pa­ny­ing neg­a­tive re­in­force­ment that lo­cally made can’t com­pare with in­ter­na­tion­ally made, even when the qual­ity of the prod­uct or ser­vice can hold its own against in­ter­na­tional stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Thought lead­ers sug­gest that cor­po­rate lead­ers need to over­come this by hav­ing the strength, force of will and un­shake­able con­fi­dence in their com­pany’s abil­ity to climb the value curve, and to possess the guts and gump­tion to com­mit the tal­ents and re­sources nec­es­sary to drive this to fruition.</p>
    <p>With the global mar­ket­place be­ing in­for­ma­tion-based and knowl­edge-in­ten­sive, in or­der to sur­vive and thrive, cor­po­rate lead­ers must have the hu­mil­ity and open­ness to learn, and to be re­cep­tive to new ideas, to suc­cess­fully nav­i­gate the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket­place and drive the com­pany up the value curve.</p>
    <p>Vi­sion­ary cor­po­rate lead­ers like Acer founder Stan Shih and Sam­sung chair­man Lee Kun-hee em­bod­ied these traits, to be the re­lent­less forces that trans­formed their com­pa­nies into the global mar­ket­place lead­ers that they are to­day.</p>
    <p>The strate­gies they im­ple­mented were less a con­scious process based on de­tailed pre­scrip­tive mod­els, and more of an in­tu­itive and flex­i­ble ap­proach to busi­ness sur­vival con­sis­tent with broad per­sonal and busi­ness ob­jec­tives.</p>
    <p>With strong poli­cies and in­fra­struc­ture al­ready in place to in­ter­na­tion­ally cat­a­pult lo­cal SMEs that are ready (S’pore brand mark to help lo­cal firms stand out abroad, Sept 22), it may now be up to lo­cal SME lead­ers to take that leap of faith and drive their firms into the lime­light of the global mar­ket­place.</p>
