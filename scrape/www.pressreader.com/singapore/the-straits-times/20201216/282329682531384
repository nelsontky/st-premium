    <p>TOKYO Ja­pan rugby coach Jamie Joseph is rel­ish­ing a 2023 World Cup re­union with “Mir­a­cle of Brighton” ar­chi­tect Ed­die Jones, but warned yes­ter­day that more top-level com­pe­ti­tion was cru­cial for his team’s prepa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Last year’s quar­ter-finalists have been drawn in Pool D with Ar­gentina and an Eng­land side coached by Jones, who led Ja­pan to their ti­tanic up­set of South Africa at the 2015 tour­na­ment in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Jones’ links with Ja­panese rugby go back decades and he is still di­rec­tor of rugby for Tokyo club Sun­tory Sun­go­liath. But Joseph is con­fi­dent of out­wit­ting the Aus­tralian when they meet in three years.</p>
    <p>“I hope that he thinks that we’re far too be­hind Eng­land to be wor­ried about at this stage,” the New Zealan­der told an on­line press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“He’s got an in­ti­mate knowl­edge of pretty much every­thing in rugby apart from what we do. We’re adapt­ing all the time.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan stunned Ire­land and Scot­land and topped their group en route to a first quar­ter-fi­nal ap­pear­ance at last year’s World Cup on home soil.</p>
    <p>But the coron­avirus pan­demic and a Su­per Rugby reshuf­fle have left Asia’s top rugby na­tion un­able to cap­i­talise this year.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo-based Sun­wolves, who played some home matches in Sin­ga­pore, were booted out of Su­per Rugby af­ter win­ning just eight games over four full sea­sons, while the na­tional team have not played since the World Cup be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The do­mes­tic Top League has also been out of ac­tion since aban­don­ing its sea­son in Fe­bru­ary af­ter six rounds, and Joseph warned that his play­ers must have reg­u­lar ex­po­sure to top-level rugby if they are to make a mark in 2023.</p>
    <p>“The Sun­wolves weren’t very suc­cess­ful re­sults-wise but in terms of pre­par­ing our play­ers for a ma­jor cam­paign in 2019, it was ex­actly what we needed,” Joseph said. “Hav­ing a com­pe­ti­tion sim­i­lar to Su­per Rugby is go­ing to be cru­cial to our prepa­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“I don’t be­lieve Top League alone is go­ing to be enough rugby, un­less of course we have an ex­tended Test-match sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan will play the Bri­tish and Ir­ish Lions in Ed­in­burgh on June 26, and the Ja­pan Rugby Foot­ball Union said yes­ter­day it is con­fi­dent of ar­rang­ing three top-level Test matches be­fore and af­ter that fix­ture.</p>
