    <p>Me­di­a­corp artist</p>
    <p>She was the fe­male cham­pion of tal­ent show Star Search 2003 and is cur­rently star­ring in Chan­nel 8 drama se­ries A Jun­gle Sur­vivor.</p>
    <p>I was from: Tan­jong Ka­tong Girls’ School (1997 to 2000).</p>
    <p>My best school mem­o­ries: “I was very into soft­ball, my co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity (CCA), and have a lot of fond mem­o­ries of train­ing. When I was in Sec­ondary 3, our soft­ball team even trav­elled to Shang­hai for the Asian Women’s Soft­ball Cham­pi­onship. That was an amaz­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for a 15-year-old.</p>
    <p>“I was also lucky to be fea­tured in The Straits Times – my first time in this news­pa­per – when I was in Sec­ondary 4. The ar­ti­cle show­cased young tal­ent to look out for in sports. I was in­cluded for my per­for­mance in the Schools Na­tional E Divi­sion soft­ball fi­nal against Thom­son Sec­ondary. It was a hard-fought game which we lost 1-0.”</p>
    <p>One key les­son I’ve learnt:</p>
    <p>“Aca­demic suc­cess is im­por­tant, but so is char­ac­ter de­vel­op­ment. That’s what I picked up from my maths teacher, Mr Yeo Meng Han, who was also one of the CCA teach­ers in charge of soft­ball.</p>
    <p>“He al­ways took the ef­fort to add a page of in­spi­ra­tional short sto­ries to our work­sheets. He didn’t just care about our stud­ies but our char­ac­ter too.</p>
    <p>“A few weeks ago, I caught up with him and his fam­ily. He still keeps boxes of photos of our soft­ball com­pe­ti­tions and I man­aged to get some from him.”</p>
    <p>If I were a stu­dent again: “I’d still choose to spend time on sports, which also helped me aca­dem­i­cally. It taught me about per­se­ver­ance and doing things I never thought I could, es­pe­cially dur­ing pres­sure-packed mo­ments. I learnt not to give up.</p>
    <p>“These lessons were ap­pli­ca­ble to sit­u­a­tions that I faced dur­ing ex­am­i­na­tions and in life.”</p>
