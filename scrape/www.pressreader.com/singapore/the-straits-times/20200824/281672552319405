    <p>On top of hav­ing to work more in­ten­sively dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod, en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vice as­so­ciate Roslina Muham­mad, 44, had an added emo­tional bur­den.</p>
    <p>Since Malaysia’s l ock­down i n March, the Malaysian, who works at Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH), has been sep­a­rated from her 22-year-old daugh­ter back home.</p>
    <p>She was among the many Malaysians who used to com­mute to Singapore daily for work.</p>
    <p>“I was wor­ried for my daugh­ter be­cause it was not very safe for her to live alone in Jo­hor (Baru). Dur­ing the first two to three weeks, she would cry when I video-called her. But she also had to un­der­stand I had to work,” said Ms Roslina.</p>
    <p>Af­ter stay­ing in a ho­tel in March, she rented a room in a Hous­ing Board flat in Yishun in April.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, her col­league, Mr Irme Mohd Zak­wan, also a Malaysian, has been rent­ing a flat in Yishun with a few friends, af­ter stay­ing in a ho­tel for two to three months.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vice as­so­ciate, who nor­mally lives with his par­ents in Jo­hor Baru, said: “My mum told me to stay in Singapore and con­tinue work­ing. She told me not to worry about her be­cause she could take care of her­self.”</p>
    <p>Ms Roslina and Mr Irme are from KTPH’s en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices de­part­ment, which is made up largely of for­eign staff. The 100-plus em­ploy­ees are in charge of keep­ing the hos­pi­tal clean and han­dling li­nen.</p>
    <p>Their head of de­part­ment, Madam Thangavalu San­tha, 63, said al­most all her Malaysian staff stayed in Singapore to work af­ter their home coun­try’s lock­down.</p>
    <p>“I am im­pressed that till to­day, they are still here, while their fam­i­lies are in Malaysia. They said they will re­turn only af­ter (the) Covid (sit­u­a­tion) is set­tled here and in Malaysia.”</p>
    <p>Dis­in­fect­ing the hos­pi­tal has be­come more rig­or­ous over the past seven months, with the staff hav­ing to don per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) while work­ing in high­risk ar­eas.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vice as­so­ciate Indo Rani Marimuthu, 58, who works in the hos­pi­tal’s acute and emer­gency (A&E) care cen­tre, said she had to in­crease her stamina to meet the faster pace of work.</p>
    <p>“Work was tir­ing. Af­ter clean­ing each bed, we had to wash our hands and put on a fresh set of PPE. The bio­haz­ard bins were full af­ter every five min­utes, and when they call for pa­tient trans­fer, we have to quickly fin­ish our work and be on standby.”</p>
    <p>When Covid-19 pa­tients are trans­ferred from the A&E to pan­demic wards, Ms Indo has to fol­low the path and mop the floor to pre­vent the spread of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“It was dif­fi­cult to breathe with the N95 mask, and the tight­ness of the mask and gog­gles caused headaches. But I was fo­cused on giv­ing the best for the pa­tients... good qual­ity clean beds and toi­lets,” she said.</p>
    <p>Madam San­tha’s staff were also ini­tially ap­pre­hen­sive about the risk of Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I was most con­cerned about their safety. Even if they have to rush, I al­ways stress that they must wear the PPE prop­erly,” said Madam San­tha.</p>
