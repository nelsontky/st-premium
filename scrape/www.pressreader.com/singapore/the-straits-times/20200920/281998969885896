    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ira­nian hack­ers, most likely em­ploy­ees or af­fil­i­ates of the gov­ern­ment, have been run­ning a vast cy­ber es­pi­onage op­er­a­tion equipped with sur­veil­lance tools that can out­smart en­crypted mes­sag­ing sys­tems, a ca­pa­bil­ity Iran was not pre­vi­ously known to pos­sess, ac­cord­ing to two dig­i­tal se­cu­rity re­ports re­leased Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tion not only tar­gets do­mes­tic dis­si­dents, re­li­gious and eth­nic mi­nori­ties and anti-gov­ern­ment ac­tivists abroad but can also be used to spy on the pub­lic inside Iran, said re­ports by Check Point Soft­ware Tech­nolo­gies, a cy­ber se­cu­rity tech­nol­ogy firm, and the Mi­aan Group, a hu­man rights or­gan­i­sa­tion that fo­cuses on dig­i­tal se­cu­rity in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>The re­ports say the hack­ers have suc­cess­fully in­fil­trated mo­bile phones and computers be­long­ing to the tar­gets, over­com­ing ob­sta­cles cre­ated by en­crypted ap­pli­ca­tions like Tele­gram and, ac­cord­ing to Mi­aan, even gain­ing access to in­for­ma­tion on What­sApp.</p>
    <p>The hack­ers have also cre­ated mal­ware dis­guised as An­droid ap­pli­ca­tions, the re­ports said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Tele­gram said the com­pany was un­aware of the Ira­nian hacker op­er­a­tion but that “no ser­vice can pre­vent be­ing im­i­tated i n ‘phish­ing’ at­tacks when some­one con­vinces users to en­ter their cre­den­tials on a ma­li­cious web­site”.</p>
    <p>What­sApp de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The re­ports sug­gest sig­nif­i­cant ad­vances in the com­pe­tency of Ira­nian in­tel­li­gence hack­ers. And they come amid warn­ings from Wash­ing­ton that Iran is us­ing cy­ber sab­o­tage to try to in­flu­ence the US elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors on Wed­nes­day iden­ti­fied two Ira­nian in­di­vid­u­als they said had hacked into US computers and stolen data on be­half of Iran’s gov­ern­ment and for fi­nan­cial gain.</p>
    <p>“Iran’s be­hav­iour on the In­ter­net, from cen­sor­ship to hack­ing, has be­come more ag­gres­sive than ever,” said Mr Amir Rashidi, di­rec­tor of dig­i­tal rights and se­cu­rity at Mi­aan and the re­searcher for its re­port.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the re­port by Check Point’s in­tel­li­gence unit, the cy­ber es­pi­onage op­er­a­tion was set up in 2014 and its full range of ca­pa­bil­i­ties went un­de­tected for six years.</p>
    <p>Mi­aan traced the first op­er­a­tion to Fe­bru­ary 2018 from a ma­li­cious e-mail tar­get­ing a Sufi re­li­gious group in Iran af­ter a vi­o­lent con­fronta­tion be­tween its mem­bers and Ira­nian se­cu­rity forces. It traced the mal­ware used in that at­tack and fur­ther at­tacks in June this year to a pri­vate tech­nol­ogy firm in Iran’s north-east city of Mash­had named An­dromedaa.</p>
    <p>Mi­aan re­searchers de­ter­mined that An­dromedaa had a pat­tern of at­tack­ing ac­tivists, eth­nic mi­nor­ity groups and sep­a­ratist op­po­si­tion groups but also had de­vel­oped phish­ing and mal­ware tools that could tar­get the gen­eral pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The hack­ers ap­peared to have a clear goal: steal­ing in­for­ma­tion about Ira­nian op­po­si­tion groups in Europe and the United States and spy­ing on Ira­ni­ans who of­ten use mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tions to plan protests, ac­cord­ing to the Mi­aan re­port.</p>
    <p>Among the most prom­i­nent vic­tims of the at­tacks, the re­ports said, are the Mu­ja­hedeen Khalq, or MEK, an i nsur­gent group that Ira­nian au­thor­i­ties re­gard as a ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion; a group known as the As­so­ci­a­tion of Fam­i­lies of Camp Ashraf and Lib­erty Residents; the Azer­bai­jan Na­tional Re­sis­tance Or­gan­i­sa­tion; cit­i­zens of Iran’s restive Sis­tan and Balochis­tan prov­ince; and Hrana, an Ira­nian hu­man rights news agency. Hu­man rights lawyers and jour­nal­ists work­ing for Voice of Amer­ica have also been tar­geted, Mi­aan said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Check Point, the hack­ers use a va­ri­ety of in­fil­tra­tion tech­niques, in­clud­ing phish­ing, but the most widespread method is send­ing what ap­pear to be tempt­ing doc­u­ments and ap­pli­ca­tions to care­fully se­lected tar­gets.</p>
    <p>One of th­ese is a Per­sian­lan­guage doc­u­ment ti­tled The Regime Fears The Spread Of The Revo­lu­tion­ary Can­nons.docx, re­fer­ring to the strug­gle be­tween the gov­ern­ment and the MEK, sent to mem­bers of that movement.</p>
    <p>An­other doc­u­ment was dis­guised as a re­port widely awaited by hu­man rights ac­tivists on a cy­ber se­cu­rity re­searcher. Th­ese doc­u­ments con­tained mal­ware code that ac­ti­vated a num­ber of spy­ware com­mands from an ex­ter­nal server when the re­cip­i­ents opened them on their desk­tops or phones.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Check Point re­port, al­most all of the tar­gets have been or­gan­i­sa­tions and op­po­nents of the gov­ern­ment who have left Iran and are now based in Europe. Mi­aan doc­u­mented tar­gets in the United States, Canada and Turkey as well as the Euro­pean Union.</p>
