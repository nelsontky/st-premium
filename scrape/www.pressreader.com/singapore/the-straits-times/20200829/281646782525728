    <p>Mr Shinzo Abe ended his first trou­bled 2006-2007 term as Ja­panese premier by quit­ting abruptly, cit­ing ill health.</p>
    <p>Here are the key el­e­ments of his record since he re­turned to of­fice in De­cem­ber 2012.</p>
    <p>COVID-19 RE­SPONSE, SCAN­DALS</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has not suf­fered an ex­plo­sive coro­n­avirus out­break, but a re­cent rise in in­fec­tions has fu­elled con­cern that Mr Abe is putting too much em­pha­sis on the econ­omy over health.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe has drawn fire for an ini­tial re­sponse to the out­break that crit­ics called clumsy and, more re­cently, for a seem­ing lack of lead­er­ship, in­clud­ing few me­dia ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>Dis­sat­is­fac­tion with his re­sponse, as well as scan­dals such as the ar­rest of a for­mer jus­tice min­is­ter and his law­maker wife on sus­pi­cion of vote-buy­ing, have eroded Mr Abe’s rat­ings.</p>
    <p>A Ky­odo news agency week­end sur­vey showed Mr Abe’s voter sup­port at 36 per cent, down from 38.8 per cent the pre­vi­ous month and the sec­ond low­est since he re­turned to of­fice in 2012.</p>
    <p>‘ABE­NOMICS’</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s signature “Abe­nomics” poli­cies of bold mon­e­tary eas­ing and fis­cal spend­ing ran into head­winds last year as the United StatesChin­a trade war hit ex­ports and a do­mes­tic sales tax rise hurt busi­ness and con­sumer sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>Now the pan­demic has trig­gered Ja­pan’s big­gest economic slump on record. A third straight quar­ter of de­clines knocked real gross do­mes­tic prod­uct to decade-low lev­els, wip­ing out Abe­nomics’ ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have also said Mr Abe re­lied too heav­ily on his mon­e­tary and fis­cal pol­icy with­out fol­low­ing through on a pledge of a “third ar­row” of struc­tural re­form to achieve long-term growth de­spite a fastage­ing and shrink­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>SE­CU­RITY</p>
    <p>Mr Abe bol­stered de­fence spend­ing af­ter years of de­clines and ex­panded the mil­i­tary’s abil­ity to project power abroad.</p>
    <p>In a his­toric shift in 2014, his gov­ern­ment rein­ter­preted the post­war, paci­fist Con­sti­tu­tion to al­low troops to fight over­seas for the first time since World War II.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing year, leg­is­la­tion ended a ban on ex­er­cis­ing the right of col­lec­tive self-de­fence, or de­fend­ing a friendly coun­try un­der at­tack.</p>
    <p>Faced with di­vided pub­lic opinion, how­ever, Mr Abe has not achieved his long-held goal of re­vis­ing the US-drafted Con­sti­tu­tion by writ­ing the Self-De­fence Forces, as</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s mil­i­tary is known, into the paci­fist Ar­ti­cle 9.</p>
    <p>PER­SON­NEL AP­POINT­MENTS</p>
    <p>By cre­at­ing a Per­son­nel Af­fairs Bu­reau at the Cab­i­net, Mr Abe and his right-hand aide, Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, gained greater con­trol over the ap­point­ments of bu­reau­crats, who for decades have dom­i­nated pol­i­cy­mak­ing, shift­ing the bal­ance of pol­icy power to­wards politi­cians.</p>
    <p>DI­PLO­MACY</p>
    <p>Mr Abe has cul­ti­vated warm per­sonal ties with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, avert­ing worst-case out­comes on trade.</p>
    <p>He has over­seen a cau­tious im­prove­ment in ties with China, al­though a ter­ri­to­rial row and Bei­jing’s clam­p­down on Hong Kong are caus­ing strain.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions with South Korea turned frigid due to dis­putes over the wartime past.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe has made lit­tle progress to­wards re­solv­ing a long-run­ning feud with Russia over dis­puted is­lands seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II. The row has kept the two coun­tries from sign­ing a for­mal peace treaty end­ing the war.</p>
    <p>Nor has Mr Abe been able to set­tle a feud with North Korea over Ja­panese cit­i­zens kid­napped by Pyongyang’s agents in the 1970s and 1980s, an is­sue he put at the cen­tre of his po­lit­i­cal ca­reer.</p>
