    <p>We thank Mr Tan Hao Yang for his let­ter (Re­con­sider re­vised ca­pac­ity lim­its for fu­ner­als, Aug 1).</p>
    <p>The multi-min­istry task force takes a care­ful, cal­i­brated ap­proach to re­sum­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>As we ease re­stric­tions on key life events, we must con­tinue to limit our to­tal risk ex­po­sure so that we can keep com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 low while re­sum­ing key ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Since Tues­day, each wed­ding cou­ple has been al­lowed up to 50 at­ten­dees (in­clud­ing the cou­ple) at their mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tion. The cou­ple may also hold one wed­ding re­cep­tion with up to 50 at­ten­dees in to­tal, for the en­tire du­ra­tion of the event.</p>
    <p>This is lim­ited to venues that are per­mit­ted to serve food and drinks, such as res­tau­rants and ho­tels, and sub­ject to their ca­pac­ity limit based on safe man­age­ment prin­ci­ples.</p>
    <p>Solem­ni­sa­tions at other des­ig­nated venues will con­tinue to take place with up to 10 at­ten­dees. All other wed­ding-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties must still ad­here to pre­vail­ing gath­er­ing size lim­its.</p>
    <p>We recog­nise that the pass­ing of a loved one is an emo­tion­ally dif­fi­cult pe­riod for the fam­i­lies in­volved. Since Tues­day, the gath­er­ing size limit for wakes and fu­ner­als has been in­creased to 30 peo­ple at any point in time, up from the pre­vi­ous limit of 20.</p>
    <p>At wakes, rel­a­tives and friends may come and go at dif­fer­ent times over the course of the wake, hence this re­vised gath­er­ing size limit will fa­cil­i­tate more than 30 in­di­vid­u­als to pay their last re­spects, so long as the num­ber of peo­ple present does not ex­ceed 30 at any point in time.</p>
    <p>The task force will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the si­t­u­a­tion and ad­just pre­vail­ing guide­lines to en­able the safe and grad­ual re­sump­tion of key so­cial and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>We urge Sin­ga­pore­ans to ad­here to the spirit of the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, while ad­just­ing to the new nor­mal, so that we can con­tinue to pro­tect our fam­ily and loved ones as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
