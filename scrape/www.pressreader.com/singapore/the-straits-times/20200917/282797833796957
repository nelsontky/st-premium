    <p>LONDON • Bri­tish star John Boyega (left) has quit his role as a global am­bas­sador for the per­fume and can­dle brand Jo Malone after the black ac­tor was cut from a pro­mo­tional video in China.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal ver­sion of the short film, called London Gent, fol­lowed Boyega spend­ing time with friends and fam­ily in his home city of London, but he was re­placed by Chi­nese ac­tor Liu Hao­ran and other black cast mem­bers were re­moved in a reshot ver­sion.</p>
    <p>Boyega, 28, best known for his role as Finn in the re­cent Star Wars movies (2015 to 2019), said the de­ci­sion to sub­sti­tute him with a lo­cal ac­tor with­out his con­sent or prior no­tice was wrong.</p>
    <p>“The film cel­e­brated my per­sonal story – show­cas­ing my home­town, in­clud­ing my friends and fea­tur­ing my fam­ily,” he wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“While many brands un­der­stand­ably use a va­ri­ety of global and lo­cal am­bas­sadors, dis­mis­sively trad­ing out one’s culture this way is not some­thing I can con­done.”</p>
    <p>Jo Malone, which is owned by New York-based Es­tee Lauder, apol­o­gised last Satur­day for tak­ing the ad cre­ated and di­rected by Boyega and re­plac­ing him with Liu, say­ing it was “a mis­take”.</p>
    <p>“While we i mme­di­ately t ook ac­tion and re­moved the lo­cal ver­sion of the cam­paign, we recog­nise that this was painful and that of­fence was caused,” the com­pany said in a state­ment is­sued ex­clu­sively to The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the com­pany ac­knowl­edged Boyega’s de­ci­sion to step down as the com­pany’s first male global am­bas­sador.</p>
    <p>“John Boyega is an in­cred­i­ble tal­ent, artist and per­son and we were proud to have him as part of our Jo Malone London fam­ily. We re­spect John’s de­ci­sion and we wish him all the best,” Jo Malone wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time Boyega has been at the brunt of edit­ing for the Chi­nese mar­ket. Dis­ney’s recre­ated movie poster for the 2015 film Star Wars: The Force Awak­ens saw Boyega’s char­ac­ter Finn re­duced sig­nif­i­cantly in size.</p>
    <p>Boyega, who was born in London to par­ents of Nige­rian de­scent, emerged as a high-pro­file voice dur­ing a Black Lives Mat­ter rally in London in June.</p>
    <p>“We have al­ways been im­por­tant. We have al­ways meant some­thing. We have al­ways suc­ceeded, re­gard­less. And now is the time. I ain’t wait­ing,” he said in an emo­tional speech that won praise from a list of fel­low ac­tors.</p>
