    <p>J-pop star To­mo­hisa Ya­mashita may have left his agency of 24 years in late Oc­to­ber af­ter a scan­dal, but he does not seem to be tak­ing a break.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the Ja­panese idol, known to fans as Yamapi, posted on In­sta­gram pho­tos and a video of his life in Canada, show­ing him read­ing, cook­ing or us­ing a tablet.</p>
    <p>Ya­mashita is in Canada film­ing the movie The Man From Toronto, which stars Kevin Hart, Woody Har­rel­son and Ka­ley Cuoco.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old, who re­cently acted in the in­ter­na­tional thriller se­ries The Head (2020), said he may be able to re­turn to Ja­pan be­fore the end of the year if his film­ing is com­pleted as sched­uled.</p>
    <p>Hart last week posted on so­cial me­dia a photo of him­self with Ya­mashita and Har­rel­son and wrote: “Wel­come to Toronto... what an amaz­ing ad­di­tion to our movie you are... we are lucky to have you, man.”</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese idol had left his agency Johnny & As­so­ciates un­der a cloud in late Oc­to­ber, af­ter he was em­broiled ear­lier in a scan­dal.</p>
    <p>Ya­mashita and an­other J-pop star, Kazuya Ka­me­nashi, 34, were dis­ci­plined by the agency in Au­gust af­ter they were spot­ted drink­ing with two un­der­age girls in July. Ya­mashita was sus­pended from show-busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties for an un­spec­i­fied pe­riod of time, while Ka­me­nashi was given a stern warn­ing and re­quired to write a letter to re­flect on his ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Ya­mashita, a for­mer mem­ber of idol group News, shot to fame af­ter act­ing in the drama Nobuta Wo Pro­duce in 2005.</p>
    <p>He has also acted in the pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion se­ries Code Blue (2008 to 2017) and its movie spin-off, which was Ja­pan’s top-gross­ing do­mes­tic film of 2018.</p>
