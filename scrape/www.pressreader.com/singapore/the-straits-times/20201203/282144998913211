    <p>A woman has been hauled to court, ac­cused of mix­ing her men­strual blood and urine into food meant for oc­cu­pants of a Sengkang flat.</p>
    <p>Canares Rowena Ola, who is from the Philip­pines, is fac­ing one charge of mis­chief, which car­ries a jail term of up to a year and a fine.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old was ex­pected to plead guilty yes­ter­day but de­cided to dis­pute the charge while in a dis­trict court.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Keith Jieren Thiru­maran told Dis­trict Judge Marvin Bay that Ola had ear­lier ad­mit­ted to the of­fence in sev­eral state­ments to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>De­tails about Ola’s oc­cu­pa­tion and how she is linked to the al­leged vic­tims are not stated in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>There is also no men­tion of her rea­sons for al­legedly com­mit­ting the of­fence in De­cem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the tainted food was con­sumed and no DNA test­ing was done on it.</p>
    <p>Ola is rep­re­sented by de­fence lawyer Kalaithasa­n Karup­paya, and her pre-trial con­fer­ence will be held on Jan 25.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar case oc­curred ear­lier. An In­done­sian maid was sen­tenced to six months and seven weeks’ jail in Jan­uary for of­fences in­clud­ing taint­ing drink­ing wa­ter and rice with her urine, saliva and men­strual blood.</p>
    <p>Diana, 30, who goes by only one name, was hired by a fam­ily in Pung­gol in 2017 to work as a do­mes­tic worker.</p>
    <p>While in their flat in Au­gust last year, she mixed her bod­ily flu­ids in their rice and drink­ing wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Diana be­lieved that by drink­ing the wa­ter, they would agree with what­ever she did and would not scold her over her per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Her vic­tims ended up con­sum­ing the con­tam­i­nated items.</p>
    <p>She also stole more than $13,000 in to­tal from her em­ployer’s mother over five dif­fer­ent oc­ca­sions be­tween Au­gust 2017 and June 2018.</p>
    <p>Diana even­tu­ally pleaded guilty to two counts of mis­chief and a theft charge.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar case oc­curred ear­lier... In­done­sian maid Diana mixed her bod­ily flu­ids in her em­ployer’s fam­ily’s rice and drink­ing wa­ter. She be­lieved that by drink­ing the wa­ter, they would agree with what­ever she did and would not scold her over her per­for­mance.</p>
