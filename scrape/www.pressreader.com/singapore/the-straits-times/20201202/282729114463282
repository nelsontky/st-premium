    <p>Tai­wanese singer and tele­vi­sion per­son­al­ity Ting Hsiao-chin (left) has turned her­self in af­ter run­ning from the law for six days.</p>
    <p>Ting, who had been sen­tenced to 21/ years’ jail for</p>
    <p>2 scam­ming on­line con­sumers into buy­ing coun­ter­feit lux­ury goods, was spot­ted by the Tai­wanese me­dia at the New Taipei District Prose­cu­tor’s Of­fice yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tor’s of­fice told Taiwan’s Ap­ple Daily that Ting, 41, was later taken to the Taipei Women’s De­ten­tion Cen­tre and would be trans­ferred to Taoyuan Women’s Prison at the ear­li­est to­day.</p>
    <p>Ting is known for dat­ing boy band 5566’s Tony Sun for about five years be­fore they broke up in 2008.</p>
    <p>She re­leased two al­bums in 1999 be­fore be­com­ing a “guest artist” who ap­peared on va­ri­ety pro­grammes such as Gos­sip Queen (2005 to 2013), Mr Con & Ms Csi (2004 to 2016) and Queen (2003 to present).</p>
    <p>Ting be­came a wanted crim­i­nal last Wed­nes­day af­ter she failed to sur­ren­der her­self to serve her jail term. Her re­quest to post­pone serv­ing her sen­tence had ear­lier been re­jected.</p>
    <p>Ting’s fa­ther told the Tai­wanese me­dia that Ting, who lived with her mother, had wanted the post­pone­ment as she was tak­ing care of her mother, who is ill.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, the po­lice went to Ting’s reg­is­tered ad­dress af­ter she failed to show up at the prose­cu­tor’s of­fice, but they could not find her.</p>
    <p>An ar­rest war­rant was then is­sued for Ting.</p>
    <p>She is not the only celebrity in Taiwan who has le­gal trou­bles re­cently.</p>
    <p>In­ter­net celebrity Edward Sun, the son of prom­i­nent en­ter­tain­ers Sun Peng and Di Ying, was charged in Au­gust with at­tempt­ing to man­u­fac­ture firearms in the United States.</p>
    <p>This came af­ter he was de­ported from the coun­try in late 2018 for threat­en­ing to carry out a mass shoot­ing at the high school he at­tended in Philadel­phia. Edward Sun faces up to seven years in jail if con­victed.</p>
    <p>In April, prom­i­nent Tai­wanese di­rec­tor Doze Niu was sen­tenced to four years in prison for sex­u­ally as­sault­ing a fe­male crew mem­ber of a film that he was mak­ing.</p>
