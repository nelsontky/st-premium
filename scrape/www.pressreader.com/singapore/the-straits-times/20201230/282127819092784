    <p>A man ad­mit­ted in a dis­trict court yes­ter­day that he was one of the driv­ers in­volved in a car chase that ended in a fa­tal crash out­side the Is­tana in 2017.</p>
    <p>Se­cret so­ci­ety mem­ber Irsyad Sameer Ab­dul Rahim and his gang mem­bers had given chase to a per­son they were un­happy with, even­tu­ally lead­ing to the car be­ing pur­sued plough­ing into the Is­tana’s rear gate in Cave­nagh Road at around 6am on Dec 16 that year.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Khair­u­lan­war Mo­hamed Sani, 25, and Ms Nu­rul Filzah Syazwani Ab­dul Rahim, 21, were killed in the crash.</p>
    <p>This tragedy failed to de­ter Irsyad, 29, from com­mit­ting more vi­o­lent acts. He slashed two men with a parang on March 31, 2018, be­fore caus­ing hurt to a po­lice­man a week later, on April 7, to evade ar­rest. He was fi­nally caught later that day and charged in court.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, who ap­peared in court via video link yes­ter­day, pleaded guilty to 20 charges for of­fences in­clud­ing as­sault, vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to a pub­lic ser­vant, drug con­sump­tion and ri­ot­ing.</p>
    <p>Twenty-four other charges in­clud­ing mul­ti­ple dru­gre­lated ones will be con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Irsyad and his gang mem­bers were at Club Bal­iza in Ma­rina Square on Dec 16, 2017, when one of them punched a man, Mr Jo­hari Sharif.</p>
    <p>The club’s se­cu­rity staff then told Irsyad and his gang to leave. Still un­happy, the group waited out­side and later spot­ted a white car driven by Mr Khair­u­lan­war with two pas­sen­gers, Ms Nu­rul and Mr Jo­hari. Mr Jo­hari sur­vived the crash, suf­fer­ing mul­ti­ple fractures.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Irsyad and three of his gang mem­bers armed them­selves with parangs and at­tacked Mr Her­manto Ab­dul Talib, 41, a ri­val gang mem­ber, on March 31, 2018. Irsyad also slashed a cus­tomer at KTV Club Destino in Jalan Be­sar. The po­lice said in an ear­lier state­ment that Irsyad was later iden­ti­fied and an op­er­a­tion was mounted to nab him on April 7 that year.</p>
    <p>When Irsyad spot­ted the po­lice, he sped off in his car, strik­ing a po­lice­man who was later taken to hospi­tal and treated for in­juries in­clud­ing mul­ti­ple abra­sions. The po­lice ar­rested Irsyad later that day.</p>
    <p>He is ex­pected to be sen­tenced on Jan 19.</p>
