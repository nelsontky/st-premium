    <p>ORLANDO • Ma­jor League Base­ball (MLB) com­mis­sioner Rob Man­fred de­fended the sport’s Covid-19 safety pro­to­cols on Mon­day af­ter pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus tests for the Mi­ami Mar­lins threat­ened to de­rail the sea­son four days af­ter it be­gan.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an ESPN re­port, at least 13 Mar­lins play­ers have tested pos­i­tive in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>The Mar­lins opened their sea­son on Friday in Philadel­phia and were set to re­turn to Florida on Sun­day for their sched­uled Mon­day game against the Bal­ti­more Ori­oles. But they put off trav­el­ling af­ter the pos­i­tive tests. The team’s Tues­day game against the Ori­oles in Mi­ami will also be post­poned.</p>
    <p>The Philadel­phia Phillies were sched­uled to host the New York Yan­kees on Mon­day but that game was post­poned be­cause the Mar­lins had used the sta­dium.</p>
    <p>MLB said the games were shelved while it con­ducts “ad­di­tional Covid-19 test­ing”, with the Mar­lins self-quar­an­tin­ing in Philadel­phia and await­ing the re­sults.</p>
    <p>If the tests are neg­a­tive, the team will play the Ori­oles to­day in Bal­ti­more. The de­lays are a po­ten­tially omi­nous sit­u­a­tion for the MLB and other pro­fes­sional sports leagues in the United States hop­ing to forge ahead dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Most of the (MLB) own­ers re­alise that we built pro­to­cols an­tic­i­pat­ing that we would have pos­i­tive tests at some point dur­ing the sea­son,” Man­fred told MLB Net­work.</p>
    <p>“The pro­to­cols were built in or­der to al­low us to con­tinue to play through those pos­i­tives... We be­lieve the pro­to­cols are ad­e­quate to keep our play­ers safe.”</p>
    <p>Un­like the Na­tional Hockey League and Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA), which are re­sum­ing their sea­sons this week, MLB opted not to con­duct play in­side bub­bles, a de­ci­sion Man­fred said was rooted in the prac­ti­cal re­al­i­ties of pro­fes­sional base­ball.</p>
    <p>“We would have had to have mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions prob­a­bly just in or­der to have enough fa­cil­i­ties to make it work. The num­bers of peo­ple in­volved and the num­bers of peo­ple to sup­port the num­ber of play­ers was much, much larger in our sport,” he said.</p>
    <p>While res­o­lute that games could con­tinue safely, he said there were cir­cum­stances in which the sea­son could be sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Bas­ket­ball Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Chris Paul had just fin­ished Mon­day’s prac­tice when he was in­formed of the out­break among the Mar­lins. Paul, the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der guard, then echoed the sen­ti­ment that oth­ers across the Orlando cam­pus have ex­pressed: He is glad the NBA’s restart is be­ing held in­side the Walt Dis­ney World bub­ble.</p>
    <p>“I know, right now, this seems to be the safest way pos­si­ble (to play),” he said.</p>
    <p>The 22 NBA teams in­vited to its restart have been at Dis­ney World for al­most three weeks, with zero pos­i­tive tests re­ported among the 346 play­ers tested daily between July 13 and July 20. NBA play­ers and coaches credit the league’s strin­gent pro­to­cols for keep­ing ev­ery­body safe and healthy.</p>
    <p>The NBA is spend­ing at least US$180 mil­lion (S$249 mil­lion) with ESPN’s par­ent com­pany, Dis­ney, on its test­ing op­er­a­tion to en­sure that the league’s 74th sea­son ends the way the pre­vi­ous 73 did – with a cham­pion crowned.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to daily test­ing, team per­son­nel are re­quired to mea­sure and record their tem­per­a­tures, oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion lev­els and ir­reg­u­lar health symp­toms. Some are wear­ing an Oura ring, which can de­tect early signs of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>There is even an anony­mous tip line avail­able if some­body on cam­pus is spot­ted break­ing a rule.</p>
    <p>“When you hear about (base­ball) coaches or play­ers com­ing down with this in their en­vi­ron­ment, it makes you think how grate­ful we have been here in the NBA,” Phoenix Suns coach Monty Wil­liams said. “You think about those guys and their fam­i­lies, those guys and what­ever long-term ef­fects may come be­cause of this virus.”</p>
