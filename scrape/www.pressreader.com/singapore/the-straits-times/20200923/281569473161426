    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) will be bring­ing to­gether two of its fac­ul­ties to form a new in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary col­lege from next year. It has been pro­posed that the Fac­ulty of Arts and So­cial Sci­ences be merged with the Fac­ulty of Sci­ence to form the Col­lege of Hu­man­i­ties and Sci­ences.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) will be bring­ing to­gether two of its fac­ul­ties – one of them its largest – to form a new in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary col­lege next year.</p>
    <p>It has been pro­posed that the Fac­ulty of Arts and So­cial Sci­ences – which has the largest en­rol­ment in NUS, with 6,404 un­der­grad­u­ates in the last aca­demic year – be merged with the Fac­ulty of Sci­ence to form the Col­lege of Hu­man­i­ties and Sci­ences, The Straits Times has learnt.</p>
    <p>Both fac­ul­ties are lo­cated at the univer­sity’s Kent Ridge cam­pus.</p>
    <p>The two fac­ul­ties will still ex­ist, with plans for their cur­rent deans – Pro­fes­sor Rob­bie Goh of the Fac­ulty of Arts and So­cial Sci­ences and Pro­fes­sor Sun Ye­neng of the Fac­ulty of Sci­ence – to be­come co-deans of the new col­lege, ST un­der­stands.</p>
    <p>An NUS spokesman con­firmed that “the pro­posal is still in the con­sul­ta­tion stage”.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­nal con­sul­ta­tions, based on a work­ing draft for the pro­posed new col­lege that was cir­cu­lated among fac­ulty mem­bers, be­gan soon af­ter NUS pres­i­dent Tan Eng Chye wrote a com­men­tary in The Straits Times this month about the need for uni­ver­si­ties to move from sub­ject spe­cial­i­sa­tion to in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary teach­ing and re­search.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the work­ing draft seen by ST, the col­lege’s stu­dents will have ac­cess to fa­cil­i­ties and hu­man­i­ties, so­cial sci­ences, sci­ence and math­e­mat­ics cour­ses of­fered by both fac­ul­ties.</p>
    <p>This move to­wards more in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary learn­ing comes along with the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry’s push in re­cent years for grad­u­ates to have core skills and knowl­edge, while re­main­ing ver­sa­tile and adapt­able to fu­ture con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>In June, then Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said that grad­u­ates need more broad-based ex­per­tise to meet an ever-chang­ing land­scape mov­ing for­ward, and called for a “big­ger trans­for­ma­tive push” to this end.</p>
    <p>If ap­proved, the new col­lege could be­gin ac­cept­ing stu­dents as soon as the next aca­demic year which be­gins next Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tan said the pro­posed col­lege will equip stu­dents with mar­ket-rel­e­vant skills to thrive in the fu­ture econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The rapid pace of change in many in­dus­tries means that the old model of in­tense aca­demic spe­cial­i­sa­tion will no longer work for our young adults.</p>
    <p>“Rather, grad­u­ates in the work­force will need breadth of knowl­edge, depth, as well as the abil­ity to in­te­grate mul­ti­ple dis­ci­plines to solve com­plex prob­lems,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that NUS has been pi­o­neer­ing in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary teach­ing and learn­ing over the last 20 years, and its aca­demics are also ex­celling in in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary re­search.</p>
    <p>NUS will of­fer 10 cross-dis­ci­plinary de­gree pro­grammes from Au­gust next year to lever­age syn­er­gies be­tween com­ple­men­tary dis­ci­plines. Some pos­si­ble pair­ings of com­ple­men­tary dis­ci­plines in­clude eco­nom­ics and data sci­ence, com­put­ing and project man­age­ment, as well as en­gi­neer­ing and busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Dr Ti­mothy Chan, di­rec­tor of the aca­demic and stu­dent devel­op­ment di­vi­sions at SIM Global Ed­u­ca­tion, noted that the new col­lege will see “two very dif­fer­ent do­mains of ex­per­tise put to­gether”.</p>
    <p>“One is hard, nat­u­ral sci­ence, while an­other is the arts and hu­man­i­ties,” he said. “In con­fronting re­al­life prob­lems, apart from sci­en­tific in­quiry, you need a hu­man­is­tic as­pect to con­sider so­ci­etal im­pli­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>The plan by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) to house two of its old­est fac­ul­ties – arts and so­cial sci­ences, and sci­ence – un­der a new col­lege is a ma­jor shift away from the tra­di­tional way of learn­ing in si­los.</p>
    <p>Both fac­ul­ties date as far back as 1929, and, over the years, have grown their pool of spe­cial­i­sa­tions – from psy­chol­ogy and his­tory to math­e­mat­ics and life sci­ences.</p>
    <p>But to­day’s is­sues and jobs are com­plex, and a new way of think­ing and learn­ing needs to be forged to bet­ter pre­pare stu­dents for the world be­yond school sub­jects.</p>
    <p>The new Col­lege of Hu­man­i­ties and Sci­ences at NUS sends a very strong sig­nal that the in­sti­tu­tion is se­ri­ous about break­ing down the walls be­tween sub­jects and en­cour­ag­ing the in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary shar­ing of ex­per­tise across fields.</p>
    <p>This is the lat­est push in NUS’ ef­forts in re­cent years to be­come in­creas­ingly flex­i­ble in its cur­ric­ula.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity had an­nounced in June that it would be of­fer­ing 10 cross-dis­ci­plinary de­gree pro­grammes from Au­gust next year.</p>
    <p>NUS has also seen a healthy in­ter­est from stu­dents in its dou­ble-de­gree pro­grammes, as well as more de­mand for dou­ble ma­jors and mi­nors – an in­di­ca­tion that young peo­ple are in­creas­ingly keen on broad­en­ing their per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>The new col­lege must take it a step fur­ther, so that stu­dents do not just pur­sue mul­ti­ple ar­eas of in­ter­est, but are able to see how and where they in­ter­sect.</p>
    <p>The 13 com­mon mod­ules they have to take – in ar­eas such as com­pu­ta­tional rea­son­ing, writ­ing and de­sign think­ing – aim to give them a broad un­der­stand­ing of in­tel­lec­tual ap­proaches across the hu­man­i­ties, so­cial sci­ences, sci­en­tific in­quiry and Asian stud­ies. They will spend a third of their over­all cur­ricu­lum on such mod­ules, and more in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary projects look set to be a big­ger part of their learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with peers from other dis­ci­plines can help ex­pose stu­dents to view­points they may not have con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>These changes are nec­es­sary if uni­ver­si­ties want to keep pace with the needs of the job mar­ket and tech­no­log­i­cal changes.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents will still grad­u­ate with a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in arts, so­cial sci­ences or sci­ence. But hav­ing depth of knowl­edge alone is not suf­fi­cient to wres­tle with so­ci­etal is­sues that cut across dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>As NUS pres­i­dent Tan Eng Chye wrote in a com­men­tary in The Straits Times ear­lier this month, dis­ci­plinary rigour will still be nec­es­sary, but stu­dents will have to be able to draw con­nec­tions across dif­fer­ent fields.</p>
    <p>He cited Bri­tish philoso­pher Isa­iah Ber­lin, who di­vided thinkers into two types: hedge­hogs, who know that one big thing; and foxes, who know many things.</p>
    <p>The world will need both the hedge­hog and the fox for their qual­i­ties, said Pro­fes­sor Tan.</p>
    <p>The hope is that NUS’ de­ci­sion to re­struc­ture the two fac­ul­ties will help pro­duce grad­u­ates with depth and breadth, and pre­pare them for an ever-chang­ing world.</p>
