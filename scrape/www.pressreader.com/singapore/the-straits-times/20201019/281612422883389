    <p>PARIS • Thou­sands of peo­ple gath­ered in cen­tral Paris yes­ter­day to pay homage to a teacher de­cap­i­tated two days ago for show­ing car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad to his pupils.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tors held aloft posters declar­ing: “No to to­tal­i­tar­i­an­ism of thought” and “I am a teacher” in mem­ory of the vic­tim, Mr Sa­muel Paty.</p>
    <p>One rally took place at the Place de la Republique in Paris, a tra­di­tional site of protest where around 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple demon­strated in 2015 fol­low­ing a deadly at­tack on Char­lie Hebdo’s of­fices by Is­lamist gun­men. Ral­lies were also ex­pected in Lyon, Toulouse, Stras­bourg, Nantes, Mar­seille, Lille and Bordeaux.</p>
    <p>An 11th per­son was de­tained yes­ter­day, po­lice said, as the au­thor­i­ties in­ves­ti­gated the mur­der of Mr Paty, a his­tory teacher who was be­headed by a sus­pected Is­lamist in an at­tack that stunned the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Satir­i­cal mag­a­zine Char­lie Hebdo, whose of­fices were at­tacked in a mass killing five years ago, was among groups or­gan­is­ing a trib­ute to Mr Paty in Paris in the af­ter­noon. The 47-year-old teacher was killed last Fri­day out­side his school in a Paris sub­urb by an 18-year-old at­tacker.</p>
    <p>The as­sailant, named as Ab­dul­lakh A, was of Chechen ori­gin and born in Rus­sia. He was shot dead by po­lice soon af­ter the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Sources close to the in­ves­ti­ga­tion have said that the as­sailant shouted “Al­lahu Ak­bar” be­fore the po­lice opened fire.</p>
    <p>Wit­nesses said he was spot­ted at the school last Fri­day af­ter­noon ask­ing pupils where he could find Mr Paty.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the teacher had shown his pupils car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad in a class on free­dom of ex­pres­sion, an­ger­ing a num­ber of Mus­lim par­ents. Mus­lims be­lieve that any de­pic­tion of the Prophet is blas­phe­mous.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has por­trayed the killing as an at­tack on the heart of French val­ues.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Jean-Michel Blan­quer and politi­cians from across the spec­trum were due to at­tend yes­ter­day’s com­mem­o­ra­tion in cen­tral Paris.</p>
    <p>A na­tional trib­ute will be or­gan­ised on Wed­nes­day, Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s of­fice said.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said the gov­ern­ment was work­ing on a strat­egy to bet­ter pro­tect teach­ers from threats.</p>
    <p>Mr Paty had been the tar­get of an an­gry cam­paign on so­cial me­dia be­fore the at­tack.</p>
    <p>“I want teach­ers to know that, af­ter this ig­no­ble act, the whole coun­try is be­hind them,” Mr Cas­tex told the Jour­nal du Di­manche in an in­ter­view. “This tragedy af­fects each and ev­ery one of us be­cause, through this teacher, it is the Repub­lic that was at­tacked.”</p>
    <p>There were no de­tails of the 11th per­son to be de­tained in con­nec­tion with the killing.</p>
