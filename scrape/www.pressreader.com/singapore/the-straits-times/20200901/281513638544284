    <p>Ask your av­er­age Sin­ga­porean about “lo­cal comics” and what comes to mind is prob­a­bly Sonny Liew’s 2015 graphic novel, The Art Of Char­lie Chan Hock Chye. Per­haps Johnny Lau’s Mr Ki­asu, if they re­call the car­toon’s hey­day in the 1990s, or Wee Tian Beng’s epic fan­tasy manga The Ce­les­tial Zone.</p>
    <p>Comic scenes the world over are seen as male-dom­i­nated and the Sin­ga­pore one is no dif­fer­ent. But the pro­file of women in lo­cal comics is on the rise, from the in­cep­tion of a new women-run comics publisher to the over­seas suc­cess of artists like up-and-comer Weng Pixin.</p>
    <p>When Feli­cia Low-Jimenez – au­thor, book­seller and self-avowed geek – set about as­sem­bling her team for in­de­pen­dent publisher Dif­fer­ence En­gine, she did not in­tend to hire women specif­i­cally. It just hap­pened that most of the core team ended up be­ing young women.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ence En­gine was set up in April 2018 as the comics pub­lish­ing arm of lo­cal cre­ative group Potato Pro­duc­tions. It be­gan putting out books in June this year.</p>
    <p>It is named, sort of, for an early 19th-cen­tury ma­chine pro­to­type by in­ven­tor Charles Bab­bage that pre­empted the mod­ern com­puter. Math­e­ma­ti­cian Ada Lovelace, daugh­ter of the poet Lord By­ron, wrote what is widely re­garded as the world’s first com­puter pro­gram for it.</p>
    <p>“It was not ac­tu­ally the Dif­fer­ence En­gine that Lovelace and Bab­bage worked on, but the An­a­lyt­i­cal En­gine,” clar­i­fies Low-Jimenez, 41. “But we thought that Dif­fer­ence En­gine was a good name be­cause we want the comics we pub­lish to be a cat­a­lyst for change, or to spot ideas and help them grow.”</p>
    <p>Low-Jimenez, who writes the best­selling chil­dren’s se­ries Sher­lock Sam with her hus­band Adan Jimenez and used to work in mer­chan­dis­ing at Books Ki­noku­niya, wants Dif­fer­ence En­gine to have a dif­fer­ent ap­proach to comic cre­ation, tak­ing chances on peo­ple who may not have a back­ground in comics but show a knack for sto­ry­telling.</p>
    <p>“What we try to do at Dif­fer­ence En­gine is to look at the world at large and see what kinds of sto­ries are needed,” she says. “One of the ar­eas we iden­ti­fied early on was that we needed more girls to study science and tech­nol­ogy. An­other was inter-gen­er­a­tional fam­i­lies – I think all of us feel it’s get­ting more dif­fi­cult for the younger gen­er­a­tion to be able to re­late to the older gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Th­ese themes ap­pear in its first two ti­tles. The Mak­ers Club: Game On! by Reimena Yee and Tintin Pan­toja, is about two girls – an artist and a coder – who build an en­vi­ron­men­tal video game to win their sec­ondary school science fair.</p>
    <p>In Me­lanie Lee and Arif Rafhan’s Amaz­ing Ash & Su­per­hero Ah Ma, out next month, 11-year-old Ash dis­cov­ers that she has su­per­pow­ers like her grand­mother. Be­sides train­ing Ash to be a su­per­hero, how­ever, Ah Ma is also cop­ing with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Slated for Novem­ber is a comic an­thol­ogy, Sound, which re­ceived more than 200 en­tries from across South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Low-Jimenez thinks more pub­lish­ers th­ese days, lo­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally, are will­ing to take a risk on dif­fer­ent kinds of sto­ries, a move which has al­lowed more women to en­ter the market.</p>
    <p>She cites the suc­cess of au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal comics such as Amer­i­can car­toon­ist Raina Tel­ge­meier’s best­selling mid­dle-grade graphic nov­els and Malaysian Erica Eng’s we­b­comic Fried Rice, about a Jo­hor teenager. This year, both won Eisner awards, the comics world equiv­a­lent of the Os­cars.</p>
    <p>EARLY FE­MALE PIONEERS</p>
    <p>Women have been work­ing in the lo­cal comics scene for a long time, even if their pres­ence re­mains un­der­rated, notes Asi­a­pac Books man­ager Chong Lingy­ing, 30.</p>
    <p>Those be­hind the scenes who shep­herd comics into be­ing in­clude The Art Of Char­lie Chan Hock Chye’s edi­tor Joyce Sim.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong’s mother Lim Li Kok founded Asi­a­pac in 1983 and pub­lished land­mark 1990s comics such as Wee’s The Ce­les­tial Zone and Re­turn Of The Con­dor He­roes, based on the Chi­nese mar­tial arts epic by the late Hong Kong writer Louis Cha.</p>
    <p>To­day, Asi­a­pac con­tin­ues to put out ed­u­ca­tional comics like Danny Jalil and Zaki Rag­man’s graphic novel about World War II hero­ine El­iz­a­beth Choy.</p>
    <p>“Fe­male artists have never been in­fe­rior in sta­tus, just pos­si­bly disad­van­taged in terms of op­por­tu­ni­ties or fam­ily sup­port,” Ms Chong adds.</p>
    <p>Early fe­male pioneers in the scene in­clude Nora Ab­dul­lah, who pro­duced comics in the 1950s for Malay-lan­guage pub­lish­ers like Geliga Press Sin­ga­pura. Born in Ke­lan­tan, she pub­lished her first comic at the age of 15, about the le­gendary Ke­lan­tanese queen Cik Siti Wan Kem­bang.</p>
    <p>In the early 2000s, artist Foo Swee Chin, bet­ter known as FSc, made waves abroad, cre­at­ing comics for Amer­i­can pub­lish­ers Slave Labour Group and Neko Press, as well as in Ja­pan. One of her char­ac­ters even spun off a line of dolls.</p>
    <p>Evan­ge­line Neo, or Eva­comics, self-pub­lished her way to suc­cess in 2014 with her Eva, Kopi And Matcha se­ries about cul­tural dif­fer­ences. Her first three books have sold more than 10,000 copies and she re­leased a fourth, A Manga Lover’s Tokyo Travel Guide, last year with in­ter­na­tional firm Tut­tle Pub­lish­ing.</p>
    <p>Sis­ters Yeo Hui Xuan and Yeo Hui San are es­tab­lished cre­ators at Wee’s stu­dio The Cre­ative Zone, where Hui Xuan pro­duced the Dream Walker se­ries in 2009.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Comic Artists Sin­ga­pore (Acas) vice-pres­i­dent Mei­han Boey, 43, says she meets many peo­ple who seem star­tled to learn what she does. “You don’t look like a comic­book writer,” they will re­mark.</p>
    <p>She adds: “If not for a cer­tain ca­chet that comes from be­ing in Acas, it would prob­a­bly be hard to find the work we do get. There’s an ex­pec­ta­tion that a fe­male writer writes only in a cer­tain way, as if we don’t each have an in­di­vid­ual voice, or are un­able to adapt it.”</p>
    <p>The ad­vent of we­b­comics and In­sta­gram has con­trib­uted to the rise in fe­male cre­ators, says Ms Chong. “The bar­ri­ers to en­try are much lower for cre­ators nowa­days – any­body can post sto­ries on­line and start build­ing an au­di­ence in no time. This means that there’s op­por­tu­ni­ties to tell new kinds of sto­ries and ex­per­i­ment with il­lus­trated for­mats.”</p>
    <p>But Neo, 39, notes that most still do this part-time or as a hobby. “I don’t think we have a good in­fra­struc­ture and market to sup­port comics,” she says. De­spite Eva­comics’ pop­u­lar­ity, most of her in­come still comes from com­mis­sioned work, not book sales.</p>
    <p>Pub­lish­ers such as Epi­gram Books, Asi­a­pac and Dif­fer­ence En­gine hope to change that even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>This year, Epi­gram Books has been pub­lish­ing new edi­tions of graphic nov­els from around the re­gion, in­clud­ing the au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal Com­ing Home, in which In­done­sian graphic nov­el­ist Tita Larasati re­flects on mov­ing back to Ban­dung af­ter nearly a decade away, with her Dutch hus­band and two kids in tow.</p>
    <p>In May this year, Asi­a­pac launched Comix.sg, a dig­i­tal data­base of lo­cal comic cre­ators, in­spired by sim­i­lar ef­forts by non­prof­its like Sing Lit Station, which runs po­etry.sg and prose.sg.</p>
    <p>It is still ex­pand­ing the data­base and plans to start or­gan­is­ing on­line meet-ups ahead of Sin­ga­pore Comic Con in December. “A cre­ator data­base is re­ally use­ful for the in­dus­try, on the cre­ation side and for au­di­ences and fans too,” says Ms Chong.</p>
    <p>She is hope­ful that the rise of women in comics will per­sist. “It’s a small in­dus­try, which means that it takes only a few peo­ple to up­end the de­mo­graph­ics. Look­ing at younger artists to­day, I’m op­ti­mistic that the scene can be­come more di­verse.”</p>
