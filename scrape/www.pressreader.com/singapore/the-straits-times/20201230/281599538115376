    <p>Peo­ple will be able to spend more time in pub­lic li­braries from next Mon­day, with Sin­ga­pore in phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>On week­days, there will be no limit on how long pa­trons can stay in the Na­tional Li­brary, pub­lic li­braries, Na­tional Archives of Sin­ga­pore and the For­mer Ford Fac­tory dur­ing op­er­at­ing hours.</p>
    <p>Time lim­its will still be in place for week­end vis­its.</p>
    <p>On Satur­days and Sun­days, pa­trons can visit the Na­tional Li­brary, re­gional li­braries in Jurong, Tampines and Wood­lands, as well as the Na­tional Archives of Sin­ga­pore, for up to three hours.</p>
    <p>For all other pub­lic li­braries, vis­its are capped at two hours. Pa­trons are en­cour­aged to book their pre­ferred time slots on­line.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) said it will also grad­u­ally re­sume its pub­lic pro­grammes, with the ex­cep­tion of guided tours.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion can be found at NLB’s GoLi­brary site.</p>
    <p>The Asian Film Ar­chive’s pub­lic screen­ings at Old­ham The­atre will also have an in­creased ca­pac­ity of 66 peo­ple, up from 50, for both the the­atre and the atrium. It will con­tinue to of­fer dig­i­tal pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“To en­sure the safety of our pa­trons, safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, ca­pac­ity con­trols and fre­quent dis­in­fec­tion of high-touch points will con­tinue to be im­ple­mented in all our premises. Pa­trons who visit our fa­cil­i­ties must wear their masks at all times and ad­here to the ca­pac­ity limit at our fa­cil­i­ties,” NLB said.</p>
    <p>“With the re­sump­tion of pro­grammes, we will also carry out ad­di­tional clean­ing, sani­ti­sa­tion and ven­ti­la­tion of pro­gramme ar­eas be­tween ses­sions.”</p>
    <p>To check how crowded the premises are be­fore vis­it­ing, the pub­lic can go to go.gov.sg/li­braryvisit-crowd or the NLB mo­bile app.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore en­tered phase three of its re­open­ing on Mon­day, when the per­mit­ted group size for social gath­er­ings went up from five to eight. Ca­pac­ity lim­its at at­trac­tions, malls and places of wor­ship have also been in­creased.</p>
