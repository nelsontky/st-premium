    <p>LON­DON • Tot­ten­ham man­ager Jose Mour­inho has said he senses the de­sire of his play­ers to end the club’s tro­phy drought af­ter they reached the League Cup fi­nal by beat­ing Cham­pi­onship side Brent­ford 2-0 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Spurs have not lifted a ma­jor tro­phy since their League Cup tri­umph over Chelsea in 2008 but they have a chance to end that drought at Wem­b­ley on April 25.</p>
    <p>Goals from Moussa Sis­soko and Son He­ung-min se­cured their ninth fi­nal ap­pear­ance in a com­pe­ti­tion they have won four times. In Mour­inho, they have a League Cup se­rial win­ner.</p>
    <p>He is just the third man­ager to reach the League Cup fi­nal with three dif­fer­ent clubs af­ter Ron Atkin­son and Ron Saun­ders.</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese man­ager is seek­ing his fifth League Cup crown af­ter pre­vi­ous wins with Chelsea (2005, 2007, 2015) and Manch­ester United (2017). He be­lieves there is a sim­ple se­cret to suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“I came to Eng­land in 2004 and I re­mem­ber... I had to learn the mean­ing of the Cups here and I al­ways took it se­ri­ously,” he said. “If there’s any se­cret, it’s to take it se­ri­ously. To re­spect what English foot­ball is.</p>
    <p>“What I sense in the team is ex­actly that de­sire. I’m not say­ing win­ning men­tal­ity, I’m not say­ing we are this or that. I just say we’re hon­est peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“The guys since the first game against Chelsea, then Stoke, and now... took it se­ri­ously. That’s what I hope to do on Sun­day in Crosby against Ma­rine (in the FA Cup third round). Try to be se­ri­ous, re­spect the op­po­nents and try to progress.”</p>
    <p>Their op­po­nents in the fi­nal will in all like­li­hood be the favourites.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United and hold­ers Manch­ester City faced each other yes­ter­day but re­gard­less of who they take on, Tot­ten­ham’s Eric Dier is ready for the chal­lenge and hun­gry for silverware.</p>
    <p>“Since I’ve been here, we’ve been want­ing to, that mo­ti­va­tion hasn’t changed,” the Eng­land in­ter­na­tional told Sky Sports. “There’s a lot of foot­ball to be played be­fore it but it’s fan­tas­tic to be in the first fi­nal pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The 2019 Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal was the last time Spurs played in a show­piece game. While they failed to rise to the oc­ca­sion, los­ing to Liver­pool, pun­dits feel they can go all the way this time, hav­ing al­ready beaten both Manch­ester clubs in the Premier League this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“When you look back at your ca­reer, you want to win tro­phies. Of course, it’s go­ing to be dif­fi­cult against two good sides but they proved they can beat City with a re­ally good per­for­mance,” former Tot­ten­ham mid­fielder Jamie Red­knapp told Sky.</p>
    <p>“Ear­lier in the sea­son, I know it’s a dif­fer­ent United team now, but they de­mol­ished them... I think with the team they’ve got right now, and they’re so ex­plo­sive up front, they can beat any­body.”</p>
    <p>Mour­inho’s track record is an­other rea­son to back Spurs, claimed the club’s former striker Dar­ren Bent.</p>
    <p>“He said on Sky, “If they go on and win it, it will be val­i­da­tion they made the right de­ci­sion to let (Mauri­cio) Pochet­tino go (in Novem­ber 2019).”</p>
