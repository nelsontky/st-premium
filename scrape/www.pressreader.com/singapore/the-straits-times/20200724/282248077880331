    <p>LONDON • When Liverpool cap­tain Jor­dan Hen­der­son lifted the Premier League tro­phy on Wed­nes­day, Cold­play’s A Sky Full Of Stars rang out at An­field.</p>
    <p>The play­ers made the song choice long be­fore fireworks on the pitch pre­ceded those that lit up the Mersey­side sky af­ter a 5-3 win over Chelsea in their last home game of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>De­spite pleas for them to stay away, sup­port­ers crowded around the sta­dium even be­fore kick-off to stage their own cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>On the field, Jur­gen Klopp’s men en­sured they ended on a high note af­ter just two wins in five pre­vi­ous games since they clinched a first English top-flight ti­tle in 30 years.</p>
    <p>Sweet first-half strikes from Naby Keita, Trent Alexan­derArnold and Ge­orginio Wi­j­nal­dum put the hosts in com­mand.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the break, Roberto Firmino scored his first league goal at An­field all sea­son. The Brazil­ian’s header ended a run of 1,591 min­utes of play and 56 at­tempted shots with­out scor­ing at the ground since net­ting against Tot­ten­ham 479 days ago.</p>
    <p>Alex Oxlade-Cham­ber­lain then en­sured Chelsea’s come­back fell short fol­low­ing goals from Olivier</p>
    <p>Giroud and sub­sti­tutes Tammy Abra­ham and Chris­tian Pulisic.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a jour­ney and to fin­ish it off like this is re­ally spe­cial,” said the in­jured Hen­der­son, who watched from the side­lines.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter this, next sea­son is go­ing to be a big chal­lenge for us. But I thought tonight we showed the men­tal­ity to come and per­form again and get the re­sult we did.”</p>
    <p>Their first Premier League ti­tle had been sealed al­most a month ago with seven games re­main­ing, fol­low­ing a three-month stop­page be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While fans missed out on a mo­men­tous night at the 53,000-ca­pac­ity An­field, Klopp was grate­ful the play­ers’ fam­ily mem­bers could join in the muted cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>“You make the best of what you can,” the Ger­man told Sky Sports af­ter his side re­mained un­beaten at home in the league for three straight sea­sons – a run of 59 games. “It means the world to me... I couldn’t be hap­pier to be hon­est, it would be perfect if the sta­dium would be full but we can­not change it.”</p>
    <p>Liverpool also beat Chelsea to lift the Uefa Su­per Cup at the start of the sea­son to go with the Premier League, Cham­pi­ons League and Club World Cup, but Klopp said that their ri­vals will look to close the gap.</p>
    <p>“We’re cham­pi­ons of Eng­land, of Europe and the world... It’s un­be­liev­able, to be hon­est. We’ll not stop. We have in­ter­nal chal­lenges and each player can im­prove.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard sug­gested some of the Reds need to work on their hu­mil­ity af­ter an ex</p>
    <p>NEW HEIGHTS TO SCALE</p>
    <p>We’re cham­pi­ons of Eng­land, of Europe and the world... It’s un­be­liev­able, to be hon­est. We’ll not stop. We have in­ter­nal chal­lenges and each player can im­prove. ’’</p>
    <p>JUR­GEN KLOPP, Liverpool man­ager, on the chal­lenges their ri­vals will pose next sea­son.</p>
    <p>change with the ri­vals’ bench fol­low­ing a free kick that was awarded against Chelsea’s Ma­teo Ko­vacic, lead­ing to Alexan­der-Arnold’s goal.</p>
    <p>“For me, it wasn’t a foul from Ko­vacic,” Lam­pard said. “There were a lot of things that were on­go­ing and on the bench... Some of the bench, it’s a fine line be­tween when you are win­ning... but also don’t get too ar­ro­gant with it.”</p>
    <p>The re­sult saw Chelsea slip­ping to fourth on 63 points, trail­ing Manchester United on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard’s side need a point from their fi­nal match on Sun­day against Wolver­hamp­ton to seal a place in next sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>“It’s huge, we know the sit­u­a­tion. It’s in our hands to get a re­sult against a very good Wolves team.”</p>
