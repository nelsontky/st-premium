    <p>AUGUSTA • At ease as he played his 87th round at the Masters, Tiger Woods stalked Augusta Na­tional on Thurs­day with the aplomb of some­one saun­ter­ing through his liv­ing room i n search of his favourite re­cliner, foot stool and coaster, for the cool drink in his hand.</p>
    <p>Shot by shot, the path was so fa­mil­iar he could have ne­go­ti­ated it in the dark.</p>
    <p>Be­cause he has won the tour­na­ment five times and has been a Masters fix­ture for the past 25 years, it is pos­si­ble he has played the golf course in those con­di­tions. And prob­a­bly still bro­ken par.</p>
    <p>Woods, the reign­ing cham­pion, was not the leader af­ter Thurs­day’s first round, which was de­layed by a nearly three-hour thun­der­storm that left dozens of golfers un­able to fin­ish their ses­sions.</p>
    <p>With a four-un­der 68, the 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion was tied for 10th and qui­etly three strokes be­hind the co-lead­ers, Paul Casey, Dustin John­son and Dy­lan Frit­telli.</p>
    <p>But his com­mand­ing round was the loud­est state­ment of the day. It has been an up-and-down year for</p>
    <p>Woods, but on this day he was com­posed and vir­tu­ally never out of po­si­tion on the dev­il­ish Augusta Na­tional lay­out. It al­most seemed that he was on cruise con­trol, as if he could coast to a 68.</p>
    <p>“I did ev­ery­thing well to­day,” the 44-year-old, who is not prone to self-con­grat­u­la­tion, said af­ter his round. “I drove it well, hit my irons well and putted well. There’s re­ally noth­ing, look­ing back on it, that I could have done a lit­tle bit bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The sta­tis­tics speak for them­selves. He tied his best-ever open­ing round at the Masters, recorded his first bo­gey-free open­ing round in any Ma­jor since the 2009 PGA Cham­pi­onship, and it was also his first bo­gey-free round in a Ma­jor in his past 106 Ma­jor rounds.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery other sea­soned con­tender in the field knows the Masters his­tory when Woods has a good open­ing round. It is not true that he has won ev­ery time he has shot 70 or bet­ter in the first round. It has, how­ever, hap­pened four times.</p>
    <p>He has se­ri­ously con­tended on the three other oc­ca­sions when he has been two strokes or more un­der par af­ter the first day, fin­ish­ing fourth twice and sixth once.</p>
    <p>“Un­der­stand­ing how to play this golf course is just a big part of play­ing well here,” he said. “It’s so fa­mil­iar.”</p>
    <p>His steady play was a stark con­trast to most ev­ery­thing else hap­pen­ing dur­ing the first Masters round ever con­tested in Novem­ber. Noth­ing else seemed usual, with the typ­i­cally treach­er­ous greens wet and slow, the spring flo­ral colours miss­ing and the gal­leries ab­sent be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“There were a lot of dif­fer­ences to­day,” he said. “There was a drone fly­ing over the green. You don’t hear drones here. There were no pa­trons, no roars. A lot of firsts to­day. That’s kind of the way this en­tire year has been.”</p>
    <p>Many play­ers had the same sense of be­ing in a recog­nis­able, yet al­tered, place. Xan­der Schauf­fele shot a bril­liant 67, but he seemed un­sure about what to make of his round.</p>
    <p>“A lot of it felt wrong, in all hon­esty,” he said. “The greens are re­ally soft, so there isn’t a whole lot to be scared of. It was re­ally strange. You would play less break on putts and hit it harder, which is some­thing you never do here.”</p>
    <p>Casey, who has had five top-10 fin­ishes in 13 pre­vi­ous Masters, ea­gled the par-five sec­ond hole with an ap­proach shot that he ex­pected to end up over the green.</p>
    <p>“I hit a six-iron to a left-hand pin on No. 2, and you can’t hit that shot in April,” Casey said. “To­day, it just pitched and stopped in­stantly.</p>
    <p>“In April, it would have one­hopped over into the pa­trons. I prob­a­bly make five, not three.”</p>
