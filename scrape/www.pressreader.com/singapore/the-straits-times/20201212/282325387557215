    <p>A “small num­ber” of self-em­ployed Sin­ga­pore­ans have been sent let­ters ask­ing them to pay back money re­ceived through a Covid-19 as­sis­tance pro­gramme be­cause they had un­der-de­clared their in­come or num­ber of prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>The Ministry of Man­power (MOM) is ask­ing for re­funds on pay­outs given un­der the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs) af­ter it dis­cov­ered that some re­cip­i­ents had made false dec­la­ra­tions in their ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Au­dits found that they had “er­ro­neously de­clared” their in­come or the num­ber of prop­er­ties they owned, an MOM spokesman said in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times. The ministry de­clined to elab­o­rate on how many were iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Sirs, in­tro­duced in March, pro­vides self-em­ployed peo­ple with three quar­terly cash pay­outs of $3,000 each to help them with the eco­nomic un­cer­tainty caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Some who re­ceived the let­ter have ap­pealed to the ministry, claim­ing that they had not un­der­de­clared their in­come or prop­erty sta­tus.</p>
    <p>The scheme is open to those who earn a net trade in­come of up to $100,000 and live in a prop­erty with an an­nual value of no more than $21,000. Ap­pli­cants must not own more than one prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Those who are rent­ing can sub­mit proof of their an­nual rental con­tract. They must also have started self-em­ploy­ment on or be­fore March 25. A let­ter is­sued on Dec 3 and seen by ST said the re­cip­i­ent had “un­der-de­clared (their) em­ploy­ment in­come”.</p>
    <p>“We found that your monthly em­ploy­ment in­come for work years 2018 to 2020 far ex­ceeded the al­low­able thresh­old of $2,300 per month. Based on your ac­tual em­ploy­ment in­come from 2018 to 2020, you should not have been el­i­gi­ble for Sirs,” said the let­ter.</p>
    <p>It asked the re­cip­i­ent to re­turn the three Sirs pay­ments in full.</p>
    <p>The MOM spokesman said those who have re­ceived let­ters in the past few weeks have un­til the end of the year to make the re­funds, adding that some have al­ready paid and that it will con­tact the rest to give them time to do so.</p>
    <p>The ministry said it had re­lied on ap­pli­cants who did not au­to­mat­i­cally qual­ify to de­clare their em­ploy­ment in­come and num­ber of prop­er­ties owned cor­rectly on their forms.</p>
    <p>“The pay­outs were then dis­bursed to th­ese in­di­vid­u­als in good faith and in a timely man­ner,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, MOM also car­ries out our own au­dit on the pay­outs dis­bursed, and we have iden­ti­fied some cases of er­ro­neously de­clared in­come or num­ber of prop­er­ties owned in the process.</p>
    <p>“Such cases con­sti­tute a small pro­por­tion of all the Sirs ap­pli­ca­tions. The au­dit is still on­go­ing.”</p>
    <p>The ministry did not re­spond to queries on how it would con­sider ap­peals to the let­ter ask­ing for re­funds and how many Sirs ap­pli­ca­tions had been re­ceived so far.</p>
    <p>Tat­too artist Ju­dith Tan, 28, re­ceived a let­ter on Mon­day. She told ST that she had sub­mit­ted the cor­rect in­for­ma­tion on her form.</p>
    <p>She be­came self-em­ployed in Fe­bru­ary af­ter she left her job at a con­struc­tion com­pany.</p>
    <p>But the MOM spokesman said she had sig­nif­i­cantly un­der-de­clared her em­ploy­ment in­come from Jan­uary to March. The spokesman added that ap­pli­cants’ em­ploy­ment in­come should not ex­ceed $2,300 a month for the pe­riod of as­sess­ment, which is 2018, last year, or Jan­uary to March this year.</p>
    <p>As Ms Tan’s ac­tual em­ploy­ment in­come was much higher, she is re­quired to make a re­fund to be fair and con­sis­tent to all ap­pli­cants, said the spokesman, adding that the ministry had reached out to her to ex­plain the sit­u­a­tion and fa­cil­i­tate her re­fund.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress, which is in charge of ad­min­is­ter­ing the scheme, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat told Par­lia­ment in Oc­to­ber that by the end of that month, more than 195,000 peo­ple would have re­ceived the three Sirs pay­outs, which were meant to tide them over to the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Some self-em­ployed who ap­plied were given par­tial pay­outs of $2,400 each in­stead of the full sum if they did not ful­fil cer­tain cri­te­ria.</p>
