    <p>Af­ter lift­ing the English Premier League tro­phy fol­low­ing Liverpool’s 5-3 win over Chelsea at An­field on Wed­nes­day, cap­tain Jor­dan Hen­der­son de­clared they will face a “big chal­lenge” next sea­son. Man­ager Jur­gen Klopp said he be­lieved the play­ers can im­prove af­ter romp­ing to their first top-flight league ti­tle in 30 years. SPORT</p>
    <p>Suc­cess does not just bring with it ac­claim, ova­tion and plau­dits. It also cre­ates envy and jeal­ousy in ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Liverpool legend Ian Rush’s ad­vice to the Reds’ newly minted Premier League cham­pi­ons is sim­ple: Em­brace the hate.</p>
    <p>Just hours be­fore he went to An­field to watch Jur­gen Klopp’s men thump Chelsea 5-3 and then lift their first English league tro­phy in 30 years, he told The Straits Times on Wed­nes­day that a dif­fer­ent men­tal ap­proach will be needed as Liverpool be­gin next sea­son with a tar­get on their backs as they de­fend their ti­tle.</p>
    <p>In a Zoom in­ter­view ar­ranged by Acro­nis, Liverpool’s cy­ber pro­tec­tion part­ners, Rush said: “As cham­pi­ons, ev­ery­one will want to beat you more than ever, and… from my own ex­pe­ri­ence, I loved it.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple want to beat you, it means they’re scared of you, and (that’s) the men­tal ap­proach you have to take.</p>
    <p>“When (ri­val fans) were boo­ing us, we wanted to win more. You need that win­ning men­tal­ity, which was what Liverpool were known for in the ’70s and ’80s, up un­til 1990 when we (last) won the league.”</p>
    <p>Rush, who scored 346 goals in 660 games for Liverpool across two stints and 15 sea­sons be­tween 1980 and 1996, is the Reds’ record goalscorer and helped them lift five top-flight league ti­tles, three FA Cups, five League Cups and two Euro­pean Cups.</p>
    <p>The 58-year-old said im­prov­ing the squad be­fore next sea­son’s ti­tle de­fence is now a pri­or­ity for man­ager Klopp.</p>
    <p>And while Rush noted that the Liverpool academy has been churn­ing out fine tal­ents – he is most ex­cited by 19-year-old at­tack­ing mid­fielder Cur­tis Jones – he said bring­ing in ex­pe­ri­ence will be vi­tal.</p>
    <p>He con­ceded though that Klopp has a “dif­fi­cult” sit­u­a­tion on his hands try­ing to find qual­ity and sea­soned play­ers who will have to ac­cept not be­ing au­to­matic starters.</p>
    <p>Liverpool re­port­edly missed out on sign­ing Ger­man in­ter­na­tional for­ward Timo Werner, who opted to join Premier League ri­vals Chelsea from RB Leipzig for £47.6 mil­lion (S$85 mil­lion) on the as­sur­ance of more play­ing time.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to Liverpool’s front three of Mo­hamed Salah, Sa­dio Mane and Roberto Firmino, who have scored 252 goals un­der Klopp to date, Rush said: “The prob­lem is, what hap­pens when one of the front three get in­jured?</p>
    <p>“Are you go­ing to pay £100 mil­lion for a player who is not guar­an­teed to get into the side?</p>
    <p>“If he costs £100 mil­lion, he’s not go­ing to want to sit on the bench.</p>
    <p>“So it’s dif­fi­cult to say but I’m sure Jur­gen will have some­thing un­der his belt be­cause we can’t stand still, we have to move for­ward, and that’s what the man­ager gets paid for.”</p>
    <p>In cel­e­brat­ing Liverpool’s first ti­tle tri­umph since the one he helped win, Rush heaped praise on Klopp and de­scribed the Ger­man as hav­ing the man man­age­ment skills of leg­endary for­mer man­agers Bob Pais­ley and Kenny Dal­glish.</p>
    <p>Rush also sin­gled out club cap­tain Jor­dan Hen­der­son, whom he called an “un­sung hero” whose lead­er­ship was cru­cial.</p>
    <p>The Welsh­man also hopes that this league ti­tle will usher in a pe­riod of suc­cess for the club, as it did decades ago.</p>
    <p>Rush said: “Liverpool, at the mo­ment, have a good bal­ance of ex­pe­ri­ence and youth, and I think they have a good chance to be suc­cess­ful in the next three to five years, and I hope they do that.</p>
    <p>“But in the mean­time, we still have to bring play­ers in, to keep ev­ery­one on their toes.”</p>
    <p>Acro­nis co-founder and pres­i­dent Stas Pro­tassov, whose com­pany part­nered Liverpool late last year, said: “This is a grand mo­ment not just for the team, but for mil­lions of fans around the world, and we’re pleased to share it with them.</p>
    <p>“The club’s data is in­cred­i­bly valu­able, and ac­cess­ing that data safely and ef­fi­ciently is crit­i­cal to ex­e­cut­ing their strat­egy.</p>
    <p>“The team re­ally know how to make the best use of the petabytes of data they pro­duce.”</p>
