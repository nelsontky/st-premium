    <p>New Year cel­e­bra­tions around the world yes­ter­day were muted by coro­n­avirus curbs, which forced would-be rev­ellers to stay home and bid 2020 farewell from their so­fas.</p>
    <p>Fire­work dis­plays and live events from Syd­ney to Rome were streamed on­line, and in some cases can­celled al­to­gether as fresh waves of in­fec­tion sparked re­newed lock­downs.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>The world ush­ered in the New Year, with pan­demic con­trols mut­ing cel­e­bra­tions for bil­lions of peo­ple ea­ger to bid virus­rid­den 2020 farewell.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a grind­ing year that has seen at least 1.8 mil­lion peo­ple die from Covid-19, fresh waves of in­fec­tion have sparked re­newed lock­downs and forced would-be rev­ellers to ex­tend their 2020 tradition of watch­ing events from the sofa.</p>
    <p>From Syd­ney to Rome, fire­work dis­plays, pyre burn­ings and live per­for­mances were yes­ter­day watched on­line or on tele­vi­sion – if they have not been can­celled al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson or­dered mil­lions more peo­ple to live un­der the strictest Covid-19 re­stric­tions from yes­ter­day to counter a new vari­ant of the virus that is spread­ing across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Case num­bers have risen sharply in Bri­tain in the last two weeks, driven in part by a new strain that is up to 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble than the orig­i­nal.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment, which re­ported another 981 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, said three quar­ters of Eng­land’s pop­u­la­tion would be in the top tier of re­stric­tions from 12.01am yes­ter­day, cov­er­ing 44.1 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In those ar­eas, hos­pi­tal­ity venues and non-es­sen­tial shops are closed, and house­holds can­not mix.</p>
    <p>In hard-hit Lon­don, 74-year-old Amer­i­can singer-song­writer Patti Smith will ring in the New Year with a trib­ute to Na­tional Health Ser­vice work­ers who have died from Covid-19, pro­jected on the screen at Lon­don’s Pic­cadilly Cir­cus and streamed on YouTube.</p>
    <p>Italy – where shock­ing im­ages of makeshift morgues and ex­hausted medics awoke the world to the sever­ity of the cri­sis – is un­der a na­tion­wide lock­down un­til Thurs­day, and a 10pm cur­few is in place.</p>
    <p>And in Dubai, thou­sands were ex­pected to at­tend a fire­works and a laser show at Burj Khal­ifa, the world’s tallest tower, de­spite a slew of new cases. All those at­tend­ing the event – whether at a pub­lic place, ho­tel or res­tau­rant – would be re­quired to wear masks and reg­is­ter with QR codes.</p>
    <p>In Beirut, the au­thor­i­ties were cut­ting loose. A night cur­few was pushed back to 3am. Bars, restau­rants and night­clubs had all re­opened and were ad­ver­tis­ing large par­ties to mark the turn of the year.</p>
    <p>Cel­e­bra­tions in In­dia would most likely be muted, as sev­eral states and ma­jor cities have im­posed night cur­fews, re­stricted large gath­er­ings and shut down pubs and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there were no re­stric­tions in Goa, a small state along In</p>
    <p>981</p>
    <p>Num­ber of deaths from the virus in Eng­land in the last 24 hours.</p>
    <p>dia’s west­ern coast known for its grand beach par­ties dur­ing Christ­mas and New Year. The me­dia has re­ported peo­ple ar­riv­ing in Goa in droves dur­ing the past week.</p>
    <p>In Taipei city, the gov­ern­ment was al­low­ing in-per­son at­ten­dance to its New Year’s events, as well as broad­cast­ing them live – in­clud­ing fire­works set off from the out­side of Taipei 101, once the world’s tallest build­ing. It capped at­ten­dance at the main view­ing spot at 40,000, half of the 80,000 it had orig­i­nally planned, with at­ten­dees re­quired to reg­is­ter their per­sonal details and wear masks.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia’s largest city, Syd­ney, py­rotech­nics will still light up the glit­ter­ing har­bour with a daz­zling dis­play, but few spec­ta­tors will be there to watch in per­son.</p>
    <p>Even a pro­posal to al­low 5,000 front-line work­ers to re­place ab­sent tourists on the har­bour fore­shore as a to­ken of thanks had to be aban­doned.</p>
    <p>“What a hell of a year it’s been,” said Ms Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian, the premier of New South Wales state, where Syd­ney is lo­cated. “Hope­fully 2021 will be eas­ier on all of us.”</p>
