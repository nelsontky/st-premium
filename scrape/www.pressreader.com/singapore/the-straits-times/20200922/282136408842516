    <p>I read with dis­may that 36 per cent of those polled in the Pub­lic Clean­li­ness Sat­is­fac­tion Survey, con­ducted by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, were un­sure whether trays should be re­turned in food es­tab­lish­ments (Most want laws for stricter pub­lic hy­giene, survey finds, Sept 19).</p>
    <p>This de­spite pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion, cam­paigns and the pro­vi­sion of tray-re­turn sta­tions in these es­tab­lish­ments, in­clud­ing hawker cen­tres, for years.</p>
    <p>It is note­wor­thy that 93 per cent of re­spon­dents were sat­is­fied with the clean­li­ness of pub­lic spa­ces. How­ever, the ap­palling state of our hawker cen­tres leaves much to be de­sired.</p>
    <p>It is not be­cause there are in­suf­fi­cient clean­ers, but that many pa­trons are still not re­turn­ing their trays af­ter meals.</p>
    <p>Scav­engers like pi­geons fly in quickly to feed on the leftovers, and flocks are of­ten seen on the ta­bles while other pa­trons are con­sum­ing their meals nearby.</p>
    <p>The tray-re­turn ini­tia­tive, such as the one im­ple­mented at Bukit Merah Cen­tral hawker cen­tre, has un­for­tu­nately not achieved its goals. In­stead of pay­ing a small fee for the tray upon or­der­ing, pa­trons are col­lect­ing their food with­out the tray, with some leav­ing their soiled tis­sue pa­per on the ta­ble af­ter eat­ing. Pi­geon prob­lems con­tinue un­abated.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has strict anti-lit­ter­ing laws and these are reg­u­larly en­forced against re­cal­ci­trant lit­ter­bugs.</p>
    <p>As the soft ap­proach has clearly not achieved its ob­jec­tive, is the time ripe for these laws to be ex­panded to in­clude leav­ing trays and other leftovers in pub­lic places?</p>
    <p>If it is an of­fence to dis­card used tis­sue pa­per on path­ways, should there not be a penalty for leav­ing the same on hawker cen­tre ta­bles?</p>
    <p>One sug­ges­tion is to hire tray-re­turn am­bas­sadors. A trial pe­riod of six months can be im­ple­mented whereby am­bas­sadors ad­vise pa­trons who do not re­turn their trays to do so. Af­ter the trial pe­riod, fines can be im­posed on those who break the rule.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing changes to the law on clean­ing stan­dards, some of which would make food es­tab­lish­ments more li­able in en­sur­ing cleaner premises, are a pos­i­tive step to­wards bet­ter hy­giene (Changes to law on clean­ing stan­dards likely in Oct, Sept 20).</p>
    <p>How­ever, a two-pronged ap­proach can be even more ef­fec­tive, whereby those who leave lit­ter in food es­tab­lish­ments can be held re­spon­si­ble and be pe­nalised for it.</p>
