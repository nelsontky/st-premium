    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ban on TikTok was blocked tem­po­rar­ily by a fed­eral judge, deal­ing a blow to the gov­ern­ment in its show­down with the Chi­nese-owned app that it says threat­ens na­tional se­cu­rity. The judge granted a pre­lim­i­nary in­junc­tion against the ban on new down­loads of the app. The ban would have gone into ef­fect at the end of day on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ban on TikTok was tem­po­rar­ily blocked by a fed­eral judge, deal­ing a blow to the gov­ern­ment in its show­down with the pop­u­lar Chi­nese-owned app that it says threat­ens na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an un­usual Sun­day morn­ing hear­ing, US District Judge Carl Ni­chols granted a pre­lim­i­nary in­junc­tion against the ban on new down­loads of the video-shar­ing net­work, which would have gone into ef­fect at the end of the day.</p>
    <p>The judge de­clined to grant an in­junc­tion on a sep­a­rate set of pro­hi­bi­tions sched­uled for Nov 12 de­signed to fur­ther curb the app’s use in the United States.</p>
    <p>TikTok’s owner ByteDance re­quested the hold af­ter Mr Trump or­dered the app out of US stores un­less the firm sold a stake in its US op­er­a­tions to a do­mes­tic buyer.</p>
    <p>The ban would have re­moved TikTok from stores run by Ap­ple and Google’s An­droid, the most widely used mar­ket­places for apps.</p>
    <p>TikTok has been down­loaded by more than 100 mil­lion Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>“We’re pleased that the court agreed with our le­gal ar­gu­ments and is­sued an in­junc­tion pre­vent­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the TikTok app ban,” the firm said.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue de­fend­ing our rights for the ben­e­fit of our com­mu­nity and em­ploy­ees.”</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond le­gal rul­ing against the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ef­forts to crack down on pop­u­lar apps with Chi­nese own­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has called for bans on both TikTok and Ten­cent’s WeChat, ar­gu­ing that the apps could give Bei­jing ac­cess to mil­lions of Amer­i­cans’ per­sonal data. WeChat users won a court in­junc­tion in Cal­i­for­nia against a ban last week.</p>
    <p>The bans are part of an in­creas­ingly hard line Mr Trump has taken on Bei­jing as the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion ap­proaches.</p>
    <p>The TikTok or­der was is­sued with a sealed opin­ion, so the rea­sons for the judge’s rul­ing were not im­me­di­ately avail­able. The judge also or­dered both par­ties to sub­mit a joint pro­posed sched­ule for fur­ther hear­ings “on or be­fore” to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The US Com­merce Depart­ment said: “The gov­ern­ment will com­ply with the in­junc­tion and has taken im­me­di­ate steps to do so, but in­tends to vig­or­ously de­fend the EO (Mr Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der) and the sec­re­tary’s im­ple­men­ta­tion ef­forts from le­gal chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>ByteDance is fight­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in court even as it pur­sues its ap­proval for the sale of a stake in its US busi­ness to Or­a­cle and Wal­mart. The rul­ing does not ef­fect the sale’s Nov 12 dead­line.</p>
    <p>China’s most prom­i­nent state­backed me­dia mouth­pieces have de­nounced the planned sale.</p>
    <p>“What the United States has done to TikTok is al­most the same as a gang­ster forc­ing an un­rea­son­able and un­fair busi­ness deal on a le­git­i­mate com­pany,” state-run China Daily wrote in an opin­ion piece.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the US de­ci­sion, Global Times edi­tor-in-chief Hu Xi­jin tweeted that he wel­comed the rul­ing: “I think it is in line with moral­ity, jus­tice and com­mon sense.”</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin yes­ter­day said China op­poses “the US abus­ing the con­cept of na­tional se­cu­rity”.</p>
    <p>TikTok’s lawyer told the judge on Sun­day that ban­ning it from US app stores would un­der­mine se­cu­rity by pre­vent­ing ex­ist­ing users from re­ceiv­ing weekly se­cu­rity up­dates.</p>
    <p>He ar­gued that the gov­ern­ment has less bur­den­some al­ter­na­tives, such as the sale, to achieve its na­tional se­cu­rity aims.</p>
    <p>ByteDance says Mr Trump is ex­ceed­ing his au­thor­ity with the ban.</p>
    <p>“The con­se­quences im­me­di­ately are grave,” at­tor­ney John Hall told the judge. “It would be no dif­fer­ent than the gov­ern­ment lock­ing the doors to a public fo­rum.”</p>
    <p>His lan­guage echoed the rul­ing of the judge in Cal­i­for­nia who put the hold on the WeChat ban, cit­ing its ef­fect on free speech and the ir­repara­ble harm that the ban would cause to the busi­ness.</p>
