    <p>A man among a group of seven peo­ple linked to the Orchard Tow­ers mur­der in July last year pleaded guilty yesterday to ob­struct­ing jus­tice by dis­pos­ing of a blood­stained T-shirt worn by an­other man in­volved in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Loo Boon Chong, 27, was ini­tially charged with the mur­der of Mr Satheesh Noel Go­bidass, 31.</p>
    <p>His charge was later re­duced to con­sort­ing with Tan Sen Yang, 28, who was il­lic­itly car­ry­ing a karam­bit knife – a curved blade re­sem­bling a claw – at the time of the in­ci­dent, plus an­other charge of pre­vent­ing jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The con­sort­ing charge will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The other mem­bers of the group are Tan Hong Sheng, 23; Mr Chan Jia Xing, 27; Natalie Siow Yu Zhen, 24; Joel Tan Yun Sheng, 26; and Ang Da Yuan, 26.</p>
    <p>Tan Sen Yang still faces a mur­der charge. His case and that of Tan Hong Sheng, who faces a con­sort­ing charge among other charges, are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Loo also pleaded guilty to an­other charge in a sep­a­rate in­ci­dent in Fe­bru­ary, when he gam­bled over a game of dice in a pub­lic place.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­ing the Orchard Tow­ers in­ci­dent, the court heard that the group had gone to Naughty Girl Club on the sec­ond floor of the mall in the wee hours of July 2 last year.</p>
    <p>When Loo was leav­ing Orchard Tow­ers around 6am through the ground-floor en­trance, Mr Satheesh came down alone.</p>
    <p>Mr Satheesh con­fronted a mem­ber of Loo’s group, and other mem­bers at­tacked him in re­tal­i­a­tion. Loo did not join this at­tack.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Dora Tay noted that dur­ing the at­tack, Tan Sen Yang in­jured Mr Satheesh with the karam­bit knife, in­flict­ing mul­ti­ple injuries to his head and neck area.</p>
    <p>Mr Satheesh died later that day. Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, the cause of death was a stab wound to the neck.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the brawl, Loo let Tan Sen Yang shower and change his clothes at his home at the lat­ter’s re­quest. Loo also gave him $50 for trans­port as well as a pair of slip­pers. Loo later re­alised that Tan Sen Yang had left his white blood­ied T-shirt in his bed­room, and he dis­posed of it at a com­mu­nal rub­bish chute. The blood­stained Tshirt was not found by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Loo is ex­pected to be in court on Jan 15 for mit­i­ga­tion and sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Four oth­ers in the group have been dealt with in court. Mr Chan was given a con­di­tional warn­ing in Oc­to­ber for con­sort­ing with a per­son car­ry­ing an of­fen­sive weapon in a pub­lic place. A con­di­tional warn­ing does not amount to a con­vic­tion or a find­ing of guilt, and does not leave a crim­i­nal record.</p>
    <p>If Mr Chan com­mits an of­fence within one year, he can be pros­e­cuted again for the con­sort­ing charge and for the new of­fence.</p>
    <p>Siow was sen­tenced in Oc­to­ber to five months’ jail for as­sault, and for be­ing with Tan Sen Yang.</p>
    <p>In March, Joel Tan was jailed for four weeks for as­sault, while Ang was sen­tenced to eight months’ jail and six strokes of the cane for as­sault and be­ing in the com­pany of Tan Sen Yang.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers said it had asked the po­lice to in­ves­ti­gate so­cial me­dia users who al­leged that mem­bers of the group were given pref­er­en­tial treat­ment in sen­tenc­ing on ac­count of their race. It said it will not hes­i­tate to take ac­tion against those who make such al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>If Tan Sen Yang is con­victed of mur­der, he will face the death penalty.</p>
    <p>For in­ten­tion­ally ob­struct­ing jus­tice, Loo can be jailed for up to seven years, fined, or both.</p>
