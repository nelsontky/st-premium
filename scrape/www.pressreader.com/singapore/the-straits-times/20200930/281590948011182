    <p>Amid a spi­ralling Covid-19 cri­sis, In­dia passed three laws ear­lier this month to dereg­u­late its farm sec­tor. The move, while con­tro­ver­sial, could be a pos­i­tive game changer for the coun­try’s econ­omy, says as­so­ciate edi­tor Vikram Khanna (below).</p>
    <p>Amid a spi­ralling Covid-19 cri­sis, In­dia’s govern­ment passed three laws ear­lier this month to dereg­u­late the coun­try’s farm sec­tor that some econ­o­mists reckon could be a game changer not only for agri­cul­ture, but for the econ­omy as a whole.</p>
    <p>This could be a “1991 mo­ment”, they sug­gest, re­fer­ring to the year in which In­dian in­dus­try was un­shack­led from a decades-long “Li­cence Raj” – a raft of re­stric­tions on pro­duc­tion, com­pe­ti­tion and im­ports. It set the stage for an eco­nomic boom that lasted for the bet­ter part of 20 years.</p>
    <p>But that boom, which has now stalled, did not ex­tend to In­dia’s farms, where about 60 per cent of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion live. Po­lit­i­cal par­ties have re­peat­edly promised am­bi­tious agri­cul­tural re­forms, but never de­liv­ered on them, be­cause they turned out to be too po­lit­i­cally sen­si­tive.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, In­dia’s farm­ers re­mained shack­led by con­trols on where they could sell their pro­duce and what prices they could get, which left them vul­ner­a­ble to price fluc­tu­a­tions, held back the moderni­sa­tion and growth of In­dia’s ru­ral econ­omy and mag­ni­fied the in­equal­ity be­tween ru­ral and ur­ban In­dia.</p>
    <p>UN­SHACK­LING FARM­ERS</p>
    <p>That could now start to change after the three re­forms take ef­fect.</p>
    <p>One of them is an amend­ment of the so-called Essen­tial Com­modi­ties Act (ECA), which has been in force since 1955.</p>
    <p>Un­der this Act, an ear­lier ver­sion of which was put in place by the Bri­tish dur­ing World War II, the govern­ment could im­pose lim­its on stock­pil­ing key agri­cul­tural com­modi­ties at any time, in the name of pre­vent­ing hoard­ing and price in­creases.</p>
    <p>While this might be jus­ti­fied in emer­gen­cies such as wars and famines (for which the ECA was orig­i­nally de­signed), it was con­tin­ued in nor­mal times.</p>
    <p>The ef­fects were per­verse, hurt­ing both farm­ers and con­sumers.</p>
    <p>With quan­ti­ta­tive lim­its on stock­ing farm prod­ucts li­able to be im­posed abruptly with lit­tle no­tice, there was no in­cen­tive for the pri­vate sec­tor to build stor­age fa­cil­i­ties. With­out enough stor­age, there could never be enough buf­fer stocks of com­modi­ties to sta­bilise prices.</p>
    <p>So, for ex­am­ple, dur­ing bumper har­vests, prices would col­lapse be­cause all of the sup­ply would come onto the mar­ket in­stead of some of it be­ing stored.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, dur­ing droughts or floods that dis­rupted pro­duc­tion, food prices would shoot up be­cause there were not enough buf­fer stocks in stor­age that could be re­leased into the mar­ket to make up the short­fall in sup­ply.</p>
    <p>So farm­ers were sub­jected to re­peated boom and bust cy­cles and could never earn sta­ble in­comes, lead­ing to wide­spread and chronic ru­ral dis­tress.</p>
    <p>The lack of cold stor­age also meant that vast amounts of per­ish­able farm goods, such as fruits and veg­eta­bles, sim­ply rot­ted away.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new law, the govern­ment will in­voke the ECA more spar­ingly, only in re­sponse to extraordin­ary price in­creases. This will lead to more stor­age fa­cil­i­ties, more sta­ble prices – there­fore more sta­ble in­comes for farm­ers – and less food wastage.</p>
    <p>The se­cond re­form ad­dresses a bizarre and ar­chaic mar­ket­ing regime that re­stricts farm­ers’ free­dom to sell their pro­duce.</p>
    <p>In most states of In­dia, farm­ers can sell their grains or veg­eta­bles only to li­censed agents at des­ig­nated whole­sale mar­kets – known as “man­dis” – in the dis­tricts where they op­er­ate. They are forbidden to sell to other buy­ers any­where else, not even in neigh­bour­ing dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>In other words, the man­dis have a monop­sony (a buy­ing mo­nop­oly), which gives them the power to dic­tate what prices they will pay.</p>
    <p>They sub­se­quently sell the pro­duce at a typ­i­cally fat profit to traders, and for good mea­sure also charge a com­mis­sion and tax on sales, some of which is col­lected by state gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>The farmer ends up get­ting a raw deal – usu­ally barely 30 per cent of what the fi­nal con­sumer pays for his pro­duce. Much of the rest is swal­lowed by the mandi agents and other mid­dle­men.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese agents dou­ble as money­len­ders, charg­ing usu­ri­ous rates of in­ter­est to farm­ers they have ripped off.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new law, farm­ers will be free to sell their goods to who­ever they want, even with­out mid­dle­men, and to any­where in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The man­dis can con­tinue to op­er­ate, but they would face com­pe­ti­tion from other buy­ers.</p>
    <p>The third re­form seeks to cre­ate a frame­work for con­tract farm­ing, to en­able farm­ers to en­gage di­rectly with re­tail­ers, whole­salers, ex­porters and food pro­ces­sors to pro­vide goods at pre-agreed prices.</p>
    <p>This would give farm­ers greater cer­tainty on fu­ture prices and en­able them to more ac­cu­rately es­ti­mate how much plant­ing they need to do – a de­ci­sion which, up to now, has been de­ter­mined by past prices that may not pre­vail in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>A VIR­TU­OUS CIR­CLE</p>
    <p>The sup­port­ers of th­ese re­forms in­clude not only the rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but also dis­tin­guished in­de­pen­dent agri­cul­tural econ­o­mists such as Dr Ashok Gu­lati of the In­dian Council for Re­search on In­ter­na­tional Eco­nomic Re­la­tions and Dr Ila Pat­naik of New Delhi’s Na­tional In­sti­tute of Public Fi­nance and Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>They point out that col­lec­tively, the re­forms would have a huge im­pact, es­pe­cially on farm­ers, but also the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>They would free farm­ers from their de­pen­dence on man­dis, en­abling them to get bet­ter prices and earn more pre­dictable in­comes.</p>
    <p>They would also lead to more sta­ble food prices, which would en­able in­fla­tion to be bet­ter con­trolled and also be good for con­sumers. They would boost food ex­ports as farm­ers can deal di­rectly with ex­porters.</p>
    <p>And they would raise ru­ral de­mand, lead­ing to wider spin-offs for the ru­ral econ­omy, such as more an­cil­lary ser­vices and the rise of in­dus­tries such as food pro­cess­ing, ware­hous­ing, cold stor­age, pack­ag­ing and trans­port.</p>
    <p>New sup­ply chains that more ef­fi­ciently link farm­ers to con­sumers would pro­lif­er­ate. Ris­ing ru­ral in­comes would not only raise the liv­ing stan­dards of 60 per cent of In­dia’s pop­u­la­tion but also boost the coun­try’s man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, which has strug­gled to take off.</p>
    <p>LES­SONS FROM CHINA</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar vir­tu­ous cir­cle de­vel­oped in China after its govern­ment launched agri­cul­tural re­forms in 1978 un­der then leader Deng Xiaop­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, farm­ers – who made up the ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­la­tion and largely op­er­ated in com­munes – could sell only to the govern­ment at fixed prices and were re­quired to pro­duce mostly grains.</p>
    <p>But after the re­forms, they could lease land for pri­vate farm­ing and even­tu­ally sell part of their out­put wher­ever they wanted, at mar­ket-de­ter­mined prices.</p>
    <p>They could also de­cide what they wanted to pro­duce, and many di­ver­si­fied away from grains into fruits, veg­eta­bles and live­stock, which were more prof­itable.</p>
    <p>Their in­comes took off, and the ru­ral econ­omy be­came an en­gine of growth.</p>
    <p>It spawned man­u­fac­tur­ing op­er­a­tions in the form of “town­ship and vil­lage en­ter­prises” in the 1980s that be­came the foun­da­tion of the man­u­fac­tur­ing boom that fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>In 1978, hardly any econ­o­mists fore­saw the far-reach­ing con­se­quences of China’s farm re­forms, which seemed just an in­cre­men­tal step. But they turned out to be the ba­sis for China’s eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion, a mas­ter­stroke that lifted the ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­la­tion out of poverty and pro­pelled the econ­omy into decades of high growth.</p>
    <p>Un­like China, In­dia’s re­forms be­gan not with agri­cul­ture, but with in­dus­try. While they had pos­i­tive re­sults, their ef­fects largely by­passed the ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­la­tion in ru­ral In­dia.</p>
    <p>With its farm re­forms, be­lated as they are, In­dia is tak­ing a leaf out of China’s play­book.</p>
    <p>OP­PO­NENTS PUSH BACK</p>
    <p>But th­ese re­forms have turned out to be con­tro­ver­sial. Not all po­lit­i­cal par­ties sup­port them, in­clud­ing some of the BJP’s al­lies.</p>
    <p>The re­form Bills were rushed through Par­lia­ment on a “voice vote” – the win­ners be­ing those who shouted the loud­est – with­out a count, which trig­gered pan­de­mo­nium in the Up­per House.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of farm­ers have also ob­jected, stag­ing ag­i­ta­tions and block­ing high­ways and rail­way tracks.</p>
    <p>The ob­jec­tions are man­i­fold. Farm­ers fear that hav­ing given them new free­doms to mar­ket their pro­duce, the govern­ment will re­scind its min­i­mum price sup­port pol­icy – a floor price, which the govern­ment is sup­posed to guar­an­tee farm­ers, es­pe­cially for grains.</p>
    <p>This is not true – the min­i­mum sup­port price will re­main – but fear­mon­gers, in­clud­ing those with vested in­ter­ests who stand to lose from the re­forms, such as mandi op­er­a­tors and other mid­dle­men, have spread this belief.</p>
    <p>Some state gov­ern­ments, es­pe­cially those of big farm­ing states such as Pun­jab and Haryana, protest that the re­forms are an as­sault on In­dia’s fed­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Agri­cul­ture is sup­posed to be a state sub­ject, they point out, which the govern­ment in New Delhi has ig­nored by push­ing through th­ese na­tional-level re­forms that would also de­prive state gov­ern­ments of valu­able taxes that they col­lect on sales of farm prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Some farm­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tions al­lege that while small mid­dle­men in the farm trade might dis­ap­pear, they would be re­placed by pow­er­ful ones in the form of agribusi­ness and re­tail gi­ants like Mon­santo, Cargill and Wal­mart, which would leave farm­ers at the mercy of cor­po­rate in­ter­ests who would be ra­pa­cious when ne­go­ti­at­ing con­tracts.</p>
    <p>The re­forms’ sup­port­ers counter, how­ever, that farm­ers can also or­gan­ise – and in­deed, the re­forms have a pro­vi­sion to cre­ate 10,000 “farmer pro­ducer or­gan­i­sa­tions” that would act as trade unions to en­sure farm­ers have col­lec­tive bar­gain­ing clout.</p>
    <p>Some left-lean­ing com­men­ta­tors have com­plained that the amend­ments to the ECA, which would di­lute the govern­ment’s pow­ers to im­pose stock­ing lim­its, would le­galise food hoard­ing.</p>
    <p>The de­bates will rage on, but it’s too late; the laws have been passed.</p>
    <p>NEVER WASTE A CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>It’s plau­si­ble that In­dia’s rul­ing BJP has taken ad­van­tage of the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic and the as­so­ci­ated so­cial re­stric­tions to rush through th­ese re­forms with­out ad­e­quate con­sul­ta­tion, even with its al­lies.</p>
    <p>But the same was true of the in­dus­trial re­forms of 1991, which were sum­mar­ily passed by a minority govern­ment led by then Prime Min­is­ter P.V. Narasimha Rao dur­ing a bal­ance-of-pay­ments cri­sis, with­out wide­spread de­bate.</p>
    <p>In­dian gov­ern­ments have learnt that crises should not be wasted and are, in fact, ideal mo­ments to push through sen­si­tive re­forms which, dur­ing nor­mal times, would run into all man­ner of po­lit­i­cal ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>In 1991, such op­por­tunism even­tu­ally paid off, after some ini­tial re­sis­tance. Whether the same will be true of the new agri­cul­tural re­forms re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>But if China’s ex­pe­ri­ence is any guide, th­ese re­forms could, over time, be trans­for­ma­tional for the ma­jor­ity of In­dia’s pop­u­la­tion and for its econ­omy.</p>
