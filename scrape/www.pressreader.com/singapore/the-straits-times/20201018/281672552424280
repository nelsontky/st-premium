    <p>De­spite the green light given to com­pa­nies by the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil to im­ple­ment tem­po­rary wage cuts in a bid to save jobs, at least six com­pa­nies that The Sun­day Times spoke to at a ca­reer fair yes­ter­day said they did not feel a need to do so.</p>
    <p>In­stead, these firms – from var­i­ous in­dus­tries such as food and bev­er­age, trans­porta­tion and lo­gis­tics – pointed out that they are look­ing to hire amid a weak labour mar­ket due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“On the con­trary, the Covid-19 cri­sis has ac­tu­ally brought op­por­tu­ni­ties for us,” said Mr An­drew Sim, who is chief ex­ec­u­tive of lo­gis­tics firm J&T Ex­press.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is rid­ing on the ecom­merce sec­tor which is still grow­ing rapidly, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray Law, a re­cruit­ment of­fi­cer from se­cu­rity ser­vices provider Cer­tis, said the com­pany is hir­ing as there is still de­mand for what it of­fers.</p>
    <p>“Even for the Covid-19 (cri­sis), (while a l ot of) shops may be closed... their prod­ucts are still in­side the shops,” he added.</p>
    <p>About 2,500 job seek­ers at­tended the two-day ca­reer fair held at Our Tampines Hub, ei­ther vir­tu­ally or in per­son. Those who went to the fair waited in line for in­ter­views while oth­ers con­sulted ca­reer coaches or sought guid­ance from or­gan­i­sa­tions such as Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ti­tled Ca­reer Dis­cov­ery @ North East, the job fair, which ended yes­ter­day, was or­gan­ised by the North East Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 1,400 jobs were on of­fer from 12 com­pa­nies and 27 re­tail ten­ants of Our Tampines Hub.</p>
    <p>Among the job va­can­cies, 280 were for pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) roles, in­clud­ing po­si­tions in cus­tomer ser­vices and sales.</p>
    <p>The other jobs avail­able were for aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cers, den­tal as­sis­tants, bak­ers and drivers.</p>
    <p>So­cial agen­cies and or­gan­i­sa­tions such as Men­daki also had booths at Our Tampines Hub.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment’s So­cial Ser­vice Of­fice lo­cated in Tampines were also present.</p>
    <p>These are part of ef­forts to pro­vide in­te­grated sup­port to job-seek­ing res­i­dents, said Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli at the ca­reer fair yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“As they look for jobs, they are also shown how they can get sup­port for their fi­nan­cial needs and ca­reer coach­ing, even for their fam­i­lies,” he added.</p>
    <p>Tampines GRC MP Des­mond Choo, who is the North East District Mayor, said such an in­te­grated ap­proach would be the way for­ward for fu­ture ca­reer fairs.</p>
    <p>“It will be very res­i­dent-cen­tric, help­ing them to not only tackle jobs, but (also) pro­vide them with the sup­port while they are search­ing for jobs,” he noted.</p>
