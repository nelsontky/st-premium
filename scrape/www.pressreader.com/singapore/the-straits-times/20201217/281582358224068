    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON On an earn­ings call two months ago, So­larWinds chief ex­ec­u­tive Kevin Thomp­son touted how far the com­pany had gone dur­ing his 11 years at the helm.</p>
    <p>There was not a data­base or an IT de­ploy­ment model out there to which his Austin, Texas-based com­pany did not pro­vide some level of mon­i­tor­ing or man­age­ment, he told an­a­lysts on the Oct 27 call.</p>
    <p>“We don’t think any­one else in the mar­ket is re­ally even close in terms of the breadth of cov­er­age we have,” he said. “We man­age ev­ery­one’s network gear.”</p>
    <p>Now that dom­i­nance has be­come a li­a­bil­ity – an ex­am­ple of how the work­horse soft­ware that helps glue or­gan­i­sa­tions to­gether can turn toxic when it is sub­verted by so­phis­ti­cated hack­ers.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, So­larWinds con­firmed that Orion – its flag­ship network man­age­ment soft­ware – had served as the un­wit­ting con­duit for a sprawl­ing in­ter­na­tional cy­ber es­pi­onage oper­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The hack­ers in­serted ma­li­cious code into Orion soft­ware up­dates pushed out to nearly 18,000 cus­tomers. And while the num­ber of af­fected or­gan­i­sa­tions is thought to be much more mod­est, the hack­ers have al­ready par­layed their ac­cess into con­se­quen­tial breaches at the US Trea­sury and De­part­ment of Com­merce.</p>
    <p>Three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the investigat­ion have told Reuters that Rus­sia is a top sus­pect, al­though oth­ers fa­mil­iar with the in­quiry have said it is still too early to tell.</p>
    <p>So­larWinds rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ryan Toohey said he would not be mak­ing ex­ec­u­tives avail­able for com­ment. He did not pro­vide on-there­cord an­swers to ques­tions sent via e-mail.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment is­sued on Sun­day, the com­pany said “we strive to im­ple­ment and main­tain ap­pro­pri­ate ad­min­is­tra­tive, phys­i­cal and tech­ni­cal safe­guards, se­cu­rity pro­cesses, pro­ce­dures, and stan­dards de­signed to pro­tect our cus­tomers”.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­perts are still strug­gling to un­der­stand the scope of the dam­age.</p>
    <p>The ma­li­cious up­dates – sent be­tween March and June, when Amer­ica was hun­ker­ing down to weather the first wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions – was “per­fect tim­ing for a per­fect storm”, said co-chair Kim Peretti at At­lantabased law firm Al­ston & Bird’s cy­ber-se­cu­rity pre­pared­ness and re­sponse team.</p>
    <p>As­sess­ing the dam­age would be dif­fi­cult, she said.</p>
    <p>The im­pact on So­larWinds was more im­me­di­ate.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials or­dered any­one run­ning Orion to im­me­di­ately dis­con­nect it. The com­pany’s stock has tum­bled more than 23 per cent from US$23.50 last Fri­day – be­fore Reuters broke the news of the breach – to US$18.06 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>A FIN­GER IN EV­ERY PIE</p>
    <p>We don’t think any­one else in the mar­ket is re­ally even close in terms of the breadth of cov­er­age we have... We man­age ev­ery­one’s network gear.</p>
