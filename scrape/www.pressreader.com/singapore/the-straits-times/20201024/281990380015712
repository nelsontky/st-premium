    <p>To­day, in Sin­ga­pore, we are wit­ness­ing first-hand a ma­jor change in the fi­nan­cial sys­tem for South-east Asia as China’s cor­po­rate drag­ons move quickly to re­build the re­gion’s fi­nan­cial frame­work, with­out any sig­nif­i­cant par­tic­i­pa­tion from Amer­ica’s fin­tech uni­corns.</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore will make a cru­cial de­ci­sion later this year over five di­gibank li­cences, from which the im­pli­ca­tions for the United States are enor­mous and po­ten­tially ir­rev­o­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>Of the five di­gibank li­cences, two will be “full bank li­cences” and the re­main­ing three will be “whole­sale bank li­cences”.</p>
    <p>The full bank li­cence al­lows for the holder to take de­posits from and pro­vide bank­ing ser­vices to re­tail and non-re­tail cus­tomer seg­ments, while the whole­sale bank li­cence win­ner will be al­lowed to take de­posits from and pro­vide bank­ing ser­vices to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises and other non-re­tail cus­tomer seg­ments.</p>
    <p>This op­por­tu­nity to com­pete with the in­cum­bent banks has re­sulted in large con­sor­tiums form­ing, con­sist­ing of Asia’s pow­er­ful su­per-apps, ride-share plat­forms, lead­ing tech­nol­ogy firms and fi­nan­cial firms. Un­der­ly­ing some of th­ese con­sor­tiums are part­ner­ships in­volv­ing en­ti­ties such as Grab and Sing­tel which would oth­er­wise not have part­nered each other be­fore.</p>
    <p>Deeper anal­y­sis re­veals that the likely win­ners from the di­gibank process will be the large Chi­nese</p>
    <p>cor­po­rate drag­ons, no­tably Mr Jack Ma’s Ant Group. Xiaomi Fi­nance is part of a con­sor­tium in the bank­ing li­cence race, which has also drawn con­tenders such as the Yil­lion Group, which op­er­ates a digital bank in China.</p>
    <p>Miss­ing from the di­gibank process are well-known US fin­tech uni­corns such as Robin­hood, Acorns and Le­mon­ade, to name a few. While each had con­sid­ered en­ter­ing the Asian-Pa­cific mar­ket, none had done so. Their in­abil­ity to truly ap­pre­ci­ate the power and ubiq­uity of the Asian su­per-app plat­forms may have con­trib­uted to their de­ci­sion to stay out.</p>
    <p>The im­pli­ca­tion for US firms is sig­nif­i­cant: the Chi­nese firms could end up dom­i­nat­ing the digital bank­ing in­fra­struc­ture in Sin­ga­pore, gain ex­pe­ri­ence and</p>
    <p>le­git­i­macy from their pres­ence here and ex­tend their footholds in other Asia-Pa­cific coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Short term, the open­ing up of the bank­ing sec­tor is a coup for cus­tomers. It makes the bank­ing sys­tem enor­mously com­pet­i­tive and low­ers costs for cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>But there are sig­nif­i­cant neg­a­tive im­pli­ca­tions for in­cum­bents. With their legacy sys­tems, and reg­u­la­tory regimes, the in­cum­bent banks look to be an easy mark for the new di­gibank en­trants.</p>
    <p>Longer term, as pol­i­cy­mak­ers fur­ther an­a­lyse this mar­ket dy­namic and its par­tic­i­pants, cer­tain sys­temic vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties come to the fore. The threats arise for a num­ber of rea­sons:</p>
    <p>First, the sheer scale of the ex­ist­ing user base for any of the con­sor­tiums is over­whelm­ing and</p>
    <p>places many of them in a dom­i­nant po­si­tion. We need look no fur­ther than Alibaba/Ant Fi­nan­cial to see the size ad­van­tage and low/zero client ac­qui­si­tion costs al­ready avail­able to them.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, the ubiq­uity of th­ese con­sor­tiums on users’ mo­bile phones for ap­pli­ca­tions other than “just fi­nan­cial ser­vices”. For the re­gions’ su­per-apps, the ad­di­tion of fi­nan­cial ser­vices is a nat­u­ral ex­ten­sion of many of the ser­vices they are al­ready pro­vid­ing in their home mar­kets. This ubiq­uity alone places the re­gion’s fi­nan­cial in­cum­bents at an ex­cep­tional dis­ad­van­tage rel­a­tive to their own ap­pli­ca­tions, no mat­ter how in­no­va­tive or well-branded those in­cum­bent ap­pli­ca­tions might be.</p>
    <p>Third, many of th­ese con­sor­tium en­ti­ties have the abil­ity to in­vest stag­ger­ing amounts in re­search and devel­op­ment. Many of the con­sor­tium ap­pli­cants can more than sub­sidise their en­try into the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket while lever­ag­ing their ex­ist­ing tech­nol­ogy stacks and im­prov­ing their data an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Fourth, ac­cess to the cap­i­tal mar­kets. We need look no fur­ther than Ant’s up­com­ing ini­tial public of­fer­ing – it is seek­ing to raise US$35 bil­lion (S$47.5 bil­lion) based on a val­u­a­tion es­ti­mated at over US$200 bil­lion – to see that its sheer size gives it a huge ad­van­tage over the re­gion’s in­cum­bents.</p>
    <p>One sce­nario be­ing qui­etly dis­cussed among se­nior bankers here is whether or not one of the con­sor­tiums should sim­ply buy an in­cum­bent fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Fifth, the abil­ity of the Chi­nese to think strate­gi­cally and long term. Western share­hold­ers are fo­cused on sat­is­fy­ing short-term re­turns, thus re­mov­ing the abil­ity to think long term. As a re­gional in­sur­ance chief ex­ec­u­tive said, the Chi­nese dis­ci­pline of ex­e­cu­tion around “in­flu­ence” is out­ma­noeu­vring its Western com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese cor­po­rate drag­ons have seen, and are seiz­ing, the op­por­tu­nity to re­build the grow­ing economies of South-east Asia on Chi­nese rails.</p>
    <p>This pre­sup­poses two im­por­tant – but not nec­es­sar­ily true – con­di­tions: that the Chi­nese are in­ter­ested in ne­go­ti­at­ing a new fi­nan­cial or­der with other states (in pref­er­ence to cre­at­ing a par­al­lel or­der that es­tab­lishes hur­dles for banks and tech firms out­side their sys­tem); and that Sin­ga­pore can func­tion as a site of ex­change – of ideas, rules, and cap­i­tal – for the devel­op­ment and pro­mo­tion of this new Bret­ton Woods regime.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore can – and should – have a vi­tal role in bal­anc­ing the com­ing decades’ great power dy­nam­ics, not as a sup­pli­cant to any power, but as an in­ter­locu­tor that has proven that good gov­er­nance, thought­ful ap­pli­ca­tion of the law and a will­ing­ness to ex­per­i­ment with new mod­els of ser­vices de­liv­ery can serve as the ba­sis for a new in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial regime that ac­com­mo­dates tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Due to Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as a lead­ing fi­nan­cial cen­tre, its di­gibank de­ci­sion on li­cences will be closely watched.</p>
    <p>For the US, the con­cern in both the public and pri­vate sec­tors is that if Chi­nese com­pa­nies get to dom­i­nate the digital bank­ing space, it will have an im­pact on the abil­ity of Amer­i­cans to es­tab­lish a pres­ence not just in Sin­ga­pore but South-east Asia as well.</p>
    <p>Hence, drag­ons may very well eat uni­corns.</p>
