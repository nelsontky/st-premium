    <p>• Ea­gle-eyed fans of Tai­wanese singer-song­writer Jay Chou spot­ted that he had doc­tored a photo of his wife’s belly, spark­ing spec­u­la­tion that he had done it to con­ceal a preg­nancy.</p>
    <p>The pos­si­bil­ity of a third child for Chou, 41, and Han­nah Quin­li­van, 27, who mar­ried in 2015, sent fans into a frenzy as they scru­ti­nised the group photo from a New Year’s Eve cel­e­bra­tion that the singer posted on In­sta­gram on Jan 1.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have a three-year-old son, Romeo, and a five-year-old daugh­ter, Hath­away. Chou is known for dot­ing on his wife, who is an ac­tress and model.</p>
    <p>Com­par­ing the photo with a sim­i­lar one posted by a friend, Chou’s ap­pears to have been al­tered to slim down Quin­li­van’s waist.</p>
    <p>In the process of ama­teur photo ma­nip­u­la­tion, the ta­ble leg be­hind her was also vis­i­bly dis­torted.</p>
    <p>In the friend’s photo, there was a no­tice­able bump un­der Quin­li­van’s belted trench­coat.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple Daily Tai­wan noted that Quin­li­van’s most re­cent pub­lic ap­pear­ance was in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>At the time, she had been spot­ted with a hint of a belly. She had also spo­ken pre­vi­ously of want­ing to have three chil­dren.</p>
    <p>How­ever, to the dis­ap­point­ment of Chou’s fol­low­ers, his agent has since spo­ken to quash the baby ru­mours: “It’s just that the clothes are too big.”</p>
    <p>It seems to not have been a baby bump – only a food baby af­ter the hol­i­day feast­ing.</p>
