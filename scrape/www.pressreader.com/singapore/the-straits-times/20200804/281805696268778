    <p>HONG KONG • When As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tian Fei­long first ar­rived in Hong Kong as de­mands for free elec­tions were on the rise, he said he felt sym­pa­thetic to­wards a so­ci­ety that seemed to re­flect the lib­eral po­lit­i­cal ideas he had stud­ied as a grad­u­ate stu­dent in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Then, as the calls es­ca­lated into protests across Hong Kong in 2014, he in­creas­ingly em­braced Chi­nese warn­ings that free­dom could go too far, threat­en­ing na­tional unity.</p>
    <p>He be­came an ar­dent critic of the demon­stra­tions, and six years later he is a staunch de­fender of the sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law that China has im­posed on the for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>Prof Tian is among the many Chi­nese schol­ars who have turned against Western-in­spired ideas that once flowed in China’s uni­ver­si­ties, in­stead pro­mot­ing the au­thor­i­tar­ian world­view as­cen­dant un­der China’s Pres­i­dent and Com­mu­nist Party leader Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>Th­ese Chi­nese in­tel­lec­tu­als serve as cham­pi­ons, even of­fi­cial ad­vis­ers, de­fend­ing and hon­ing the party’s hard­en­ing poli­cies, in­clud­ing the roll­out of the se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“Back when I was weak, I had to to­tally play by your rules. Now I’m strong and have con­fi­dence, so why can’t I lay down my own rules and val­ues and ideas?” As­soc Prof Tian, 37, said in an in­ter­view, ex­plain­ing the pre­vail­ing out­look in China.</p>
    <p>Wit­ness­ing the tu­mult as a vis­it­ing scholar in Hong Kong in 2014, he said, he “rethought the re­la­tion­ship be­tween in­di­vid­ual free­dom and state author­ity”.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong is, af­ter all, China’s Hong Kong. It’s up to the Com­mu­nist Party to clean up this mess.”</p>
    <p>While the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) has long nur­tured le­gions of aca­demics to de­fend its agenda, th­ese new au­thor­i­tar­ian thinkers stand out for their un­abashed, of­ten flashily eru­dite ad­vo­cacy of one-party rule and as­sertive sovereignt­y, and their turn against the lib­eral ideas that many of them once em­braced.</p>
    <p>They por­tray them­selves as for­ti­fy­ing China for an era of deep­en­ing ide­o­log­i­cal ri­valry. They de­scribe the United States as a dan­ger­ous, over­reach­ing shambles, even more so amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They op­pose con­sti­tu­tional fet­ters on party con­trol, ar­gu­ing that Western-in­spired ideas of the rule of law are a dan­ger­ous mi­rage that could hob­ble the CCP. They ar­gue that China must reclaim its sta­tus as a world power, even as a new kind of be­nign em­pire dis­plac­ing the US.</p>
    <p>They ex­tol Mr Xi as a his­toric leader, guid­ing China through a mo­men­tous trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese schol­ars, at times called “statists”, have worked on pol­icy to­wards Hong Kong, a stub­born en­clave for pro-democ­racy de­fi­ance of Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Their pro­pos­als have fed into China’s in­creas­ingly un­com­pro­mis­ing line, in­clud­ing the se­cu­rity law, which has swiftly curbed protests and po­lit­i­cal de­bate.</p>
    <p>“We ig­nore th­ese voices at our own risk,” said Pro­fes­sor Ti­mothy Cheek, a his­to­rian at the Univer­sity of Bri­tish Columbia, who helps run Read­ing The China Dream, a web­site that trans­lates works by Chi­nese thinkers. “They give voice to a stream of Chi­nese po­lit­i­cal thought that is prob­a­bly more in­flu­en­tial than lib­eral thought.”</p>
    <p>As well as cit­ing Mr Xi’s speeches, th­ese aca­demics draw on an­cient Chi­nese thinkers who coun­selled stern rulership, along with Western crit­ics of lib­eral po­lit­i­cal tra­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional Marx­ism is rarely cited; they are pro­po­nents of or­der, not rev­o­lu­tion. Many of them make re­spect­ful nods in their pa­pers to Carl Sch­mitt, the Ger­man le­gal the­o­rist who sup­plied right­ist lead­ers in the 1930s and the emerg­ing Nazi regime with ar­gu­ments for ex­treme ex­ec­u­tive power in times of cri­sis, Dr Ryan Mitchell, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of law at the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong, doc­u­mented in a re­cent pa­per.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Fu Hualing, a Univer­sity of Hong Kong law ex­pert, said of th­ese schol­ars: “They’ve pro­vided the rea­son­ing and jus­ti­fi­ca­tion... In a way, it’s the Carl Sch­mitt mo­ment here.”</p>
    <p>China’s ide­o­log­i­cal land­scape was more var­ied a decade ago, when Prof Tian was a grad­u­ate stu­dent at Pek­ing Univer­sity, a tra­di­tion­ally more lib­eral cam­pus. Cen­sor­ship was lighter, and uni­ver­si­ties tol­er­ated guarded dis­cus­sion of lib­eral ideas in class­rooms.</p>
    <p>Many schol­ars, in­clud­ing Prof Tian’s dis­ser­ta­tion ad­viser Zhang Qian­fan, ar­gued that Hong Kong, with its ro­bust judicial in­de­pen­dence, could in­spire sim­i­lar steps in main­land China.</p>
    <p>“I had also been nur­tured by lib­eral schol­ars,” Prof Tian said.</p>
    <p>Such ideas have gone into re­treat since Mr Xi took power in 2012. He be­gan a drive to dis­credit ideas like univer­sal hu­man rights, sep­a­ra­tion of pow­ers and other lib­eral con­cepts. Dis­sent­ing aca­demics are ma­ligned in the party-run news me­dia and risk pro­fes­sional ruin.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Xu Zhangrun of Bei­jing’s Ts­inghua Univer­sity was de­tained last month and dis­missed from his job af­ter writ­ing a stream of es­says con­demn­ing the party’s di­rec­tion un­der Mr Xi.</p>
    <p>The ed­u­ca­tion au­thor­i­ties gen­er­ously fund pro-party schol­ars for top­ics such as how to in­tro­duce se­cu­rity laws in Hong Kong. Chi­nese and for­eign foun­da­tions that once sup­ported less ortho­dox Chi­nese schol­ars have re­trenched peo­ple be­cause of tight­en­ing of­fi­cial curbs.</p>
    <p>More than fear and ca­reer re­wards have driven this resur­gence of au­thor­i­tar­ian ideas in China.</p>
    <p>The global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2007, and the US’ floun­der­ing re­sponse to Covid-19 have re­in­forced Chi­nese views that lib­eral democ­ra­cies are de­cay­ing, while China has pros­pered, de­fy­ing pre­dic­tions of the col­lapse of one-party rule.</p>
    <p>“China is ac­tu­ally also fol­low­ing a path that the US took, seiz­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, de­vel­op­ing out­wards, cre­at­ing a new world,” Prof Tian said. “There is even a fer­vent hope that we’ll over­take the West in an­other 30 years.”</p>

    <p>Hong Kong is, af­ter all, China’s Hong Kong. It’s up to the Com­mu­nist Party to clean up this mess.</p>
