    <p>In the midst of tak­ing Es­tee Lauder pub­lic in 1995, Mr Leonard Lauder, the com­pany’s then chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive, fielded a ques­tion from an in­vest­ment banker dur­ing the road­show.</p>
    <p>“If your prod­ucts are so good,” the banker asked Mr Lauder, then in his 60s, “why do you have so many lines on your face?”</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, Mr Lauder writes in his new book, The Com­pany I Keep: My Life In Beauty, “my wrin­kles didn’t de­ter in­vestors”.</p>
    <p>His come­back came i n t he stock’s de­but. It opened at US$26 a share and climbed to US$34.50 in its first day of trad­ing.</p>
    <p>He hasn’t quite writ­ten an au­to­bi­og­ra­phy; there isn’t much dis­cus­sion of his per­sonal life, friends, trav­els or life­style. Most of the names you’ll find in the book are hard-work­ing em­ploy­ees whom Mr Lauder sin­gles out for praise, var­i­ous in­dus­try com­peti­tors and lu­mi­nar­ies with whom he has col­lab­o­rated in var­i­ous in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Aside from his mother, father, first wife Eve­lyn, and se­cond wife Judy, even Mr Lauder’s rel­a­tives don’t get much print. Of his younger son Gary, who chose not to join the fam­ily busi­ness, Mr Lauder writes that “Gary has a ded­i­cated sense of phi­lan­thropy and do­ing his own thing” and leaves it at that.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lauder’s nice­ness, sphinx-like as it might read, doesn’t</p>
    <p>de­tract from one of the most daz­zling cor­po­rate suc­cess sto­ries in the his­tory of the United States.</p>
    <p>The book de­tails how Mr Lauder’s mother Es­tee started a cos­met­ics com­pany with noth­ing but chutz­pah and a “su­per rich allpur­pose creme”, and how Mr Lauder then built it into a roughly US$89 bil­lion (S$120 bil­lion) com­pany with 25 brands and ap­prox­i­mately 1,600 free-stand­ing re­tail stores in around 150 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>When Es­tee Lauder started out, the Amer­i­can cos­met­ics in­dus­try was dom­i­nated by El­iz­a­beth Ar­den, He­lena Ru­bin­stein, Charles of the Ritz and Revlon.</p>
    <p>His mother man­aged to suc­ceed in an al­ready crowded field, Mr Lauder writes, by com­bin­ing a per­sonal touch (lit­er­ally – her signature move was to mas­sage the lo­tion onto women’s faces) with a strat­egy to side-step, rather than con­front, her larger com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>HOW HIS MOTHER DID IT</p>
    <p>“My mother was de­ter­mined to carve out her own niche and cre­ate a unique power base,” he writes.</p>
    <p>The niche she chose was lux­ury, and the power base would be se­lect spe­cial­ity stores such as Detroit’s Himel­hoch’s depart­ment store, Sakowitz in Hous­ton and, eventu</p>
    <p>ally, Saks Fifth Av­enue in New York.</p>
    <p>“Their cus­tomers had the means to buy pre­mium-priced prod­ucts,” Mr Lauder ex­plains, and “the stores pro­vided a so­phis­ti­cated set­ting that would im­me­di­ately bur­nish my mother’s brand”. It’s a strat­egy the com­pany turned into a mantra: “Launch at the top, and stay at the top,” Mr Lauder writes.</p>
    <p>“If you launch at the top of the mar­ket, you have two ways to go: up or down,” he con­tin­ues. “If you launch into the heart of the mar­ket, there’s al­ways some­one who will sell a sim­i­lar prod­uct cheaper than you, and you have no way to go but down in what be­comes a race to the bot­tom.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lauder of­fi­cially joined the com­pany in 1958 af­ter at­tend­ing the Whar­ton School of the Univer­sity of Penn­syl­va­nia, fol­lowed by a</p>
    <p>stint in the Navy, and was named pres­i­dent in 1972. (His mother kept the ti­tle of CEO.)</p>
    <p>While his father man­aged op­er­a­tions and his mother served as the face of the com­pany, Mr Lauder be­gan to map out a busi­ness plan that mir­rored what was then the largest com­pany in the world. “My dream was to make Es­tee Lauder the Gen­eral Mo­tors of the beauty busi­ness,” he writes, “with mul­ti­ple brands, mul­ti­ple prod­uct lines and multi­na­tional dis­tri­bu­tion.”</p>
    <p>He con­ceived and launched Clin­ique in 1968, a skin­care line that cap­i­talised on the era’s nascent ap­pre­ci­a­tion for “hy­poal­ler­genic” skin­care and beauty “reg­i­mens”, rather than “prod­ucts”.</p>
    <p>“The Es­tee Lauder brand had an aura of glam­our; it em­bod­ied as­pi­ra­tion,” Mr Lauder writes. “Clin­ique was more demo­cratic; it was less about as­pi­ra­tion and more about ev­ery­day prag­ma­tism.” Sev­eral more brands fol­lowed, in­clud­ing Pre­scrip­tives (1979) and Ori­gins (1990). Start­ing in the mid-1990s, Mr Lauder be­gan to ac­quire out­side brands, in­clud­ing Mac Cos­met­ics, Bobbi Brown, Aveda and La Mer.</p>
    <p>STRAT­EGY PAID OFF</p>
    <p>In 1946, the com­pany’s first of­fi­cial year in busi­ness, an­nual rev­enue stood at US$50,000.</p>
    <p>By 1960, an­nual sales were “just a shade over US$1.75 mil­lion”, Mr Lauder writes.</p>
    <p>By the mid-1990s, rev­enue hit US$2 bil­lion; by the late 1990s they had dou­bled to more than US$4 bil­lion. To­day, an­nual sales are roughly US$14.3 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one imag­ines that I was heir to a great fam­ily for­tune,” Mr Lauder writes. “They for­get that I had to build the for­tune first.”</p>
    <p>So, why take his wildly suc­cess­ful com­pany pub­lic? Mr Lauder notes the ob­vi­ous: “To make a lot of money.” But he also sug­gests that the move was a form of suc­ces­sion plan­ning.</p>
    <p>“Money has the po­ten­tial to di­vide fam­i­lies and cause last­ing ran­cour, re­sent­ment and bit­ter­ness,” he writes. “Go­ing pub­lic took the is­sue of money off the ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lauder had been wealthy for decades; now, with an es­ti­mated net worth of US$24.6 bil­lion, he’s be­come one of the rich­est peo­ple in the world. Un­der­stand­ably, when he stepped away from the com­pany, he stepped up char­i­ta­ble giv­ing. The clos­ing sec­tion of his book is ded­i­cated to his fam­ily’s phi­lan­thropy.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Lauder can’t help bring­ing it back to his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In a fi­nal list of “lead­er­ship lessons”, he in­cludes such en­tries as “Cut your losses” and “It’s my neck”, but the fourth, “Never make an im­por­tant de­ci­sion with­out a woman at the ta­ble”, rings as the most heart­felt.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing up with a mother like Es­tee Lauder,” he writes, “how could I not re­spect and seek out smart, tough women?”</p>
