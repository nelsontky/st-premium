    <p>Tills are ring­ing again af­ter re­tail­ers pulled out all the stops to draw shop­pers with pro­mo­tions ahead of Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>Some re­tail­ers noted that busi­ness had im­proved in the past few weeks with an in­crease in foot­fall, and this is ex­pected to con­tinue over the long week­end.</p>
    <p>The Or­chard shop­ping belt was packed yesterday, with long queues out­side pop­u­lar stores like Tangs, which was among those of­fer­ing pro­mo­tions. Some peo­ple said they waited for more than 20 min­utes be­fore be­ing let into the depart­ment store, which al­lowed in shop­pers in batches as it had lim­ited al­low­able ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>House­wife Jen­nifer Ang, 63, said the deals were too good to let slip, even though she was wary of be­ing in big crowds.</p>
    <p>“Nor­mally I would not choose to come out on a Satur­day, es­pe­cially since the Gov­ern­ment said the el­derly should try to stay in as much as pos­si­ble,” said Madam Ang, who bought cook­ing ap­pli­ances from Tangs. “But I de­cided to take ad­van­tage of the deals, since I was al­ready run­ning er­rands in the area.”</p>
    <p>An­other shop­per, Mr Guo Xun, 27, picked up a printer from Courts.</p>
    <p>“I’m an em­ployee in a com­pany, and not self-em­ployed, so I’m not that afraid of spend­ing money yet,” said Mr Guo, an engi­neer.</p>
    <p>An­other shop­per, who gave her name only as Ms Yim, 28, said it looked like Sin­ga­pore­ans “do not agree” that the coun­try is in a re­ces­sion, go­ing by the num­ber of peo­ple out and about in Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>“It’s just an or­di­nary week­end for us,” said the wealth man­ager.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (SRA) ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Rose Tong said there was “def­i­nitely an air of fes­tiv­ity” in re­cent weeks, adding that an online shop­ping fes­ti­val yesterday would “def­i­nitely help drive online con­sump­tion”.</p>
    <p>“The (Na­tional Day Pa­rade) cel­e­bra­tions and pro­mo­tions in-store, as well as on (SRA app) GoSpree, are tes­ta­ment (to the air of fes­tiv­i­ties), and have pro­vided some form of ‘nor­malcy’ to re­tail,” said Ms Tong, adding that she hopes the spend­ing fer­vour will con­tinue into the vir­tual Great Sin­ga­pore Sale, which starts on Sept 9.</p>
    <p>She noted that sales had picked up from mid-July as shop­pers got used to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and SafeEn­try re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>But re­tail­ers re­main wary about prospects in the longer term.</p>
    <p>Scan­teak chief ex­ec­u­tive Jamie Lim said she recog­nised that the in­crease in sales could be due to “pent-up de­mand”, as peo­ple found it hard to shop dur­ing the cir­cuit­breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The fur­ni­ture re­tailer’s sales have been en­cour­ag­ing in the past few weeks, in­clud­ing the long week­end ear­lier this month, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tong also warned that re­tail</p>
    <p>sales were not ex­pected to re­turn to their pre-Covid-19 level, at least un­til the first or sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>“We en­vis­age many re­tail­ers will fur­ther strug­gle with cash flow and may find it harder to re­tain their work­ers. With po­ten­tial re­trench­ment, pay cuts amid a weak eco­nomic out­look, we ex­pect dis­cre­tionary re­tail to be hurt by as much as 60 per cent,” she said.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple said they waited for more than 20 min­utes be­fore be­ing let into depart­ment store Tangs, which al­lowed in shop­pers in batches as it had lim­ited al­low­able ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>“We are cer­tainly not out of the woods yet in the fight against Covid-19.”</p>
