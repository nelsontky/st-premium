    <p>The pri­or­ity should not be to de­fend the sta­tis­tics and poli­cies on why there should not be a min­i­mum wage level (WP MPs and NTUC deputy chief spar over min­i­mum wage, Oct 16).</p>
    <p>In­stead, one should first con­sider how any one in­di­vid­ual or fam­ily can sur­vive on less than $1,300 a month when the cost of liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore is no­to­ri­ously high.</p>
    <p>Th­ese 32,000 or so full-time work­ers ur­gently need help, and should not be tossed around as sta­tis­tics when­ever the topic of min­i­mum wage is raised; $1,300 a month would not solve all their daily needs but it is a good start to give them some hope.</p>
    <p>If we do not lift th­ese 32,000 work­ers out of the pit of low wages, it is fu­tile to talk about up­grad­ing their skills.</p>
    <p>If we can­not help them put food on the din­ner ta­ble or pro­vide for their ba­sic needs, it is fu­tile to talk about in­creas­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Be prac­ti­cal and re­al­is­tic. Th­ese are our fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans who are poor and des­per­ate. Th­ese are peo­ple we should not ig­nore re­gard­less of the num­ber.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is whether we give them the dig­nity and re­spect they de­serve.</p>
    <p>If we do not lift th­ese 32,000 work­ers out of the pit of low wages, it is fu­tile to talk about up­grad­ing their skills.</p>
