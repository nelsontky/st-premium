    <p>Sport­ing a crop dyed the same shade as her dusty pink tank top, Ms Char­lene Koh rat­tles off the uses of var­i­ous es­sen­tial oils to tar­get spe­cific ail­ments.</p>
    <p>Pep­per­mint and eu­ca­lyp­tus can help with joint pains; laven­der with sleep; and rose­mary has sur­pris­ingly good hair-grow­ing prop­er­ties, says the 37-year-old breast cancer sur­vivor.</p>
    <p>“Chemo­ther­apy gave me arthri­tis – I still have knee-joint pains to­day – so I use a blend of pep­per­mint, eu­ca­lyp­tus and jo­joba oil and roll it on my joints. For me, that helps.”</p>
    <p>It has been a year since she was de­clared cancer-free, but the love she dis­cov­ered for es­sen­tial oils on her year-long cancer jour­ney stuck. So much so that she started her own line of aro­mather­apy prod­ucts, called Breathe Es­sen­tials Co (breatheess­en­tialsco.com), and timed its launch for Breast Cancer Aware­ness Month.</p>
    <p>The brand is in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked to her per­sonal story, says Ms Koh, who is also a co-founder of dat­ing app Pak­tor.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing hap­pened in a mat­ter of days, she re­calls. She was di­ag­nosed with stage 1 breast cancer on April 8 last year and warded in hospi­tal the next day to await a mas­tec­tomy. By April 12, the pro­ce­dure was done.</p>
    <p>“There was no time to process any­thing. I was cry­ing – like, why me? I was in the prime of my life; I was a suc­cess­ful en­tre­pre­neur.”</p>
    <p>She had also been train­ing to be­come a barre in­struc­tor and strug­gled to be­lieve that cancer could be­fall some­one who “worked out four to five times a week, ate right, lived right and slept well”.</p>
    <p>But hers was a Her2 gene mu­ta­tion, in­de­pen­dent of fam­ily med­i­cal his­tory.</p>
    <p>“It took me some time to ac­cept that it is not about ‘why me’ or ‘why is life so un­fair?’” says Ms Koh. “I re­alised I shouldn’t think about it that way – there would be no end to all these questions. It just so hap­pened that cancer chose me.”</p>
    <p>On the ad­vice of doc­tors, she be­gan chemo­ther­apy in May, to lower the risk of the cancer re­turn­ing. It was dur­ing the six months of chemo­ther­apy that she found es­sen­tial oils to com­bat the side ef­fects, such as hot flushes and in­som­nia.</p>
    <p>She started re­ly­ing on laven­der oil to sleep bet­ter at night and rose­mary oil to help her hair grow back “faster and thicker”. Pre­fer­ring it to sleep­ing pills, Ms Koh be­lieves aro­mather­apy is “a good com­ple­ment to cancer treat­ment”.</p>
    <p>In be­tween chemo­ther­apy ses­sions and do­ing free­lance im­age styling for cloth­ing rental plat­form Style The­ory, she be­gan think­ing about start­ing a line of es­sen­tial oils. Op­tions on the market were ex­pen­sive and not up to her stan­dard.</p>
    <p>“As a cancer sur­vivor, I wanted some­thing that was pure and or­ganic. I didn’t want to breathe in any­thing that’s syn­thetic,” she says.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, she earned her aro­mather­a­pist cer­ti­fi­ca­tion on­line at New York aro­mather­apy school, the School for Aro­matic Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, she de­cided to ex­pand her life­style of­fer­ings to in­clude can­dles ($49) and a yoga mat spray ($34.90). The lat­ter was in­spired by how more were stuck at home ex­er­cis­ing and at a loss as to how they should clean their ex­pen­sive yoga mats.</p>
    <p>Her es­sen­tial oils are dis­tilled and bot­tled in the French Riviera, and can be ap­plied on the scalp and skin. There are 10 scents, priced from $33 to $65.</p>
    <p>The can­dles are made of 100 per cent co­cosoy wax sourced from Aus­tralia, blended to with­stand trop­i­cal hu­mid­ity, with wood wicks that “burn clean”.</p>
    <p>A fra­grance house head­quar­tered here for­mu­lates the scents, be­fore Ms Koh mixes and pours the can­dles by hand.</p>
    <p>Pour­ing can­dles can be back­break­ing work, so she man­ages with two “can­dle elves” in a small stu­dio in Lower Delta Road.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, she is grate­ful for how the Breast Cancer Foun­da­tion (BCF) con­nected her with cancer sup­port­ers and helped her on her jour­ney. So, she do­nates 10 per cent of pro­ceeds to BCF all year round.</p>
    <p>“A lit­tle goes a long way; I can’t save ev­ery­one, but I hope that it can ben­e­fit a few peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Barely a month into launch­ing, Ms Koh al­ready has plans to re­lease a body wash and a linen spray, and hopes to bring the brand over­seas.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, she hopes her prod­ucts can “de­light and com­fort”.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally want my brand to com­fort peo­ple in times of need. “It came from a very spe­cial place in my heart, and I hope when peo­ple are fac­ing ad­ver­sity, they think of Breathe.”</p>
    <p>I re­ally want my brand to com­fort peo­ple in times of need.</p>
    <p>’’ MS CHAR­LENE KOH on Breathe Es­sen­tials Co, which car­ries a range of 10 es­sen­tial oil scents, priced from $33 to $65</p>
    <p>Five years on, Ms Char­lene Sim still gets choked up talk­ing about her mother’s breast cancer di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>The in­spi­ra­tion be­hind the 37-year-old’s skin­care la­bel Glow­fully, Madam Sandee Lee, bat­tled the disease for four years be­fore she died in Jan­uary this year at age 63.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim says her mother had put off her an­nual mam­mo­gram screen­ing for years. It was only when Madam Lee started feel­ing dis­com­fort dur­ing a fit­ness ses­sion in Oc­to­ber 2015 that Ms Sim dis­cov­ered her mum had been qui­etly liv­ing with a lump on her right breast for two years.</p>
    <p>“She thought it was just a cyst,” says Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>The first biopsy sug­gested it was stage 2 breast cancer, but an MRI later con­firmed it to be stage 4.</p>
    <p>“When the doc­tor first told us, I didn’t know how to break the news to my mum,” Ms Sim re­calls, blink­ing back tears.</p>
    <p>“You al­ways hear about so and so get­ting cancer, but when it is some­one so close to you, it re­ally hits you. It took a long time for us to ac­cept that it was hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>She and her two younger broth­ers were ad­vised to fo­cus on im­prov­ing Madam Lee’s qual­ity of life.</p>
    <p>Care­giv­ing took a toll on Ms Sim’s job i n phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and she re­signed in Fe­bru­ary 2018 to be her mother’s main care­giver.</p>
    <p>It was then that she started be­com­ing more con­scious about what went into her food and the prod­ucts she used. Both her mum and her were skin­care junkies who loved try­ing beauty re­leases.</p>
    <p>Through her re­search, Ms Sim found that in­con­spic­u­ous in­gre­di­ents even in brand-name prod­ucts were sus­pect.</p>
    <p>“I told my mum it might even be part of the rea­son she came down with cancer. It may not be the main rea­son, but ev­ery lit­tle thing adds up.”</p>
    <p>She chucked all their old prod­ucts and switched to those of clean, in­ter­na­tional beauty brands. But these were of­ten too rich or for­mu­lated for colder cli­mates and would ag­gra­vate their acne-prone skin, says Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>She then de­cided to put all her sav­ings into cre­at­ing her own skin­care line – one free of parabens, sul­phates and other such “bad” in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t change my mum’s fate, but my own and my daugh­ters’ are still in our hands,” says the mother of two girls aged 11 and six. Her hus­band works in the clean en­ergy sec­tor.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber 2018, she launched Glow­fully (glow­fullyskin.com) with one prod­uct – a cleanser ($38.90), “some­thing ev­ery­one uses and the first skin­care prod­uct I would in­tro­duce to my daugh­ters”.</p>
    <p>Her sec­ond was an H20 Jelly Mask ($42.50) – a project in sup­port of the Breast Cancer Foun­da­tion (BCF). A small per­cent­age of pro­ceeds from each mask sold goes to BCF all year round.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to make my mum proud; I wasn’t sure she would make it,” says Ms Sim, adding that the prod­ucts were a hit with Madam Lee.</p>
    <p>“She was wor­ried about me (tak­ing on too much), but I told her I was do­ing this for the fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Pi­lot­ing her own line deep­ened her ob­ses­sion with clean in­gre­di­ents. She re­searches in­gre­di­ents thor­oughly when for­mu­lat­ing new prod­ucts, steer­ing clear of hor­mone dis­rup­tors that could po­ten­tially in­duce cancer-caus­ing hor­mones.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that much of this is not “100 per cent proven”, she adds: “If I have a choice to make a cleaner op­tion, why wouldn’t I?”</p>
    <p>Her friends have called her para­noid, but “it’s not para­noia, it’s self­care”, says Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>Co­in­ci­den­tally, she adds, many of her cus­tomers are cancer sur­vivors or pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“We’re j ust try­ing to be more mind­ful about what we use. You love your­self – that’s why you want to take care of your­self and be in the pink of health.”</p>
    <p>As a “high-risk” fam­ily mem­ber, she feels she can­not af­ford to “take chances”.</p>
    <p>She re­calls the har­row­ing ex­pe­ri­ence watch­ing her mother de­te­ri­o­rate in the last six months of her life, when the cancer cells spread to her brain.</p>
    <p>“The scary part is not go­ing through it – it’s hav­ing to watch and not be­ing able to help,” she says, un­able to shake off the sight of her mum hit­ting her head to dull the pain.</p>
    <p>It got to a point where Ms Sim con­sulted a doc­tor late last year to have her breasts and ovaries re­moved as a pre­ven­tive mea­sure. “It’s so painful for a daugh­ter to watch. I didn’t want my daugh­ters to have to watch me go through the same thing.”</p>
    <p>The doc­tor ad­vised her to go for reg­u­lar check-ups ev­ery six months in­stead – a mes­sage she hopes to re­lay with Glow­fully.</p>
    <p>She plans to use her plat­form to advocate for yearly mam­mo­grams. This month, with ev­ery or­der that in­cludes a H20 Jelly Mask, cus­tomers will re­ceive a Pink Rib­bon pin pur­chased from BCF, as a re­minder to get checked.</p>
    <p>Un­til to­day, Ms Sim’s big­gest re­gret is not hav­ing her mother’s cancer de­tected ear­lier.</p>
    <p>In Madam Lee’s fi­nal months, Ms Sim set six mile­stones for her to fight through: Ms Sim’s birthday in De­cem­ber, Christ­mas, New Year, Chi­nese New Year, mov­ing into a new place and her own birthday in May.</p>
    <p>She died on New Year’s Day, after a try­ing night when her con­di­tion took a turn for the worse.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim says: “Her de­ter­mi­na­tion was very strong. I think that’s why she man­aged to fight for 41/ years,</p>
    <p>2 de­spite be­ing given six months to live. She fought through the whole jour­ney.”</p>
