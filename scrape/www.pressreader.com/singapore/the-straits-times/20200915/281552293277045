    <p>Chi­nese power and pres­sure are not nec­es­sar­ily a hin­drance to Tai­wan’s ef­forts to build ties with oth­ers, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Goh Sui Noi (be­low).</p>
    <p>Last week, a plaque-un­veil­ing cer­e­mony took place in Taipei that in­au­gu­rated the rep­re­sen­ta­tive of­fice of the self-de­clared East African state of So­ma­liland.</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed one in the So­ma­liland cap­i­tal Hargeisa last month, com­plete with the rais­ing of flags and play­ing of an­thems, that marked the open­ing of Tai­wan’s rep­re­sen­ta­tive of­fice there.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­monies did not go down well with both China, which sees the self-gov­ern­ing Tai­wan as a break­away prov­ince, and Somalia, which considers So­ma­liland part of its ter­ri­tory. So­ma­liland de­clared in­de­pen­dence in 1991 and has been self-gov­ern­ing since then.</p>
    <p>Ac­cu­sa­tions of Tai­wan “plot­ting sep­a­ratist ac­tiv­i­ties” and in­fring­ing on Somalia’s sovereignt­y and ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity flew even though nei­ther Tai­wan nor So­ma­liland had ex­plic­itly recog­nised the other as a sov­er­eign state.</p>
    <p>In the wider scheme of things, this episode may come across as a con­tretemps in a world caught in the throes of a pan­demic and other ten­sions. But, for Tai­wan as well as So­ma­liland, the set­ting up of rep­re­sen­ta­tive of­fices is driven by the im­per­a­tive to make the most of lim­ited diplo­matic op­tions given their un­usual cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>No coun­try recog­nises So­ma­liland as a sov­er­eign state, while only 15 recog­nise Tai­wan as one. But both have in­for­mal ties with var­i­ous coun­tries and re­gions, and Tai­wan has trade and cul­tural of­fices in more than 90 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>For both So­ma­liland and Tai­wan, there is much eco­nomic ben­e­fit to be reaped from forg­ing ties. Tai­wan can help de­velop the largely agri­cul­tural econ­omy of the sta­ble but im­pov­er­ished African state, which has a per capita gross domestic prod­uct of US$350 (S$480), while So­ma­liland can give</p>
    <p>Tai­wan an eco­nomic toe­hold in the Horn of Africa. So­ma­liland says it wants in­vest­ments in ar­eas such as min­ing, fish­ing and eco-tourism.</p>
    <p>AL­TER­NA­TIVES TO DIPLO­MATIC RECOG­NI­TION</p>
    <p>For Tai­wan – as it pos­si­bly is for So­ma­liland – it is also about ex­pand­ing its in­ter­na­tional space.</p>
    <p>China has sought to iso­late Tai­wan in­ter­na­tion­ally, par­tic­u­larly after Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Tsai Ing-wen of the in­de­pen­dence-lean­ing Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party came to power in 2016 and was re-elected ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Since 2016, China has cut off of­fi­cial con­tact with Tai­wan and sought to pres­sure it eco­nom­i­cally by re­duc­ing the num­ber of Chi­nese tourists go­ing there and the amount of agri­cul­tural prod­ucts China buys from Tai­wan. Bei­jing has also stepped up ef­forts to en­tice al­lies of Tai­wan to drop diplo­matic recog­ni­tion of the is­land, re­sult­ing in it los­ing seven al­lies since</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai came to power.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has also sought to fur­ther iso­late the is­land in­ter­na­tion­ally by block­ing Tai­wan’s par­tic­i­pa­tion as an observer at var­i­ous United Na­tions or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing meet­ings of the World Health Assem­bly, the de­ci­sion-mak­ing body of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In this David ver­sus Go­liath strug­gle for diplo­matic recog­ni­tion, Tai­wan knows it will be out­gunned by China. It has taken a dif­fer­ent ap­proach in­stead – do its best to hold on to its re­main­ing diplo­matic al­lies while work­ing to ex­pand and deepen its net­work of in­for­mal ties with coun­tries in the Asian re­gion and be­yond.</p>
    <p>This is much in keep­ing with the prag­matic diplo­macy that Ms Tsai’s men­tor, the late pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui, had en­vi­sioned for Tai­wan. In his book The Road To Democ­racy – Tai­wan’s Pursuit Of Iden­tity, he wrote that Tai­wan needs re­la­tions with other coun­tries to safe­guard its ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>“For­mal diplo­matic re­la­tions are, of course, the best, but when that is im­pos­si­ble, prac­ti­cal re­la­tions cen­tring on eco­nomic ties are ef­fec­tive as well. Should even eco­nomic links be dif­fi­cult, then cul­tural ties should be pur­sued,” he wrote. Mr Lee started a Go South pol­icy in the 1990s to en­cour­age Tai­wanese busi­ness­men to in­vest in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Un­der Ms Tsai, Tai­wan started the New South­bound Pol­icy in 2016 to in­crease eco­nomic and cul­tural ties with South-east Asia, South Asia and Aus­trala­sia. This pol­icy had seen some suc­cess be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic hit, with trade grow­ing by 22 per cent and for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment up by 66 per cent in three years.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has also sought closer ties with its two key in­for­mal al­lies, the United States and Ja­pan, as well as with Euro­pean coun­tries. It is push­ing for free trade agree­ments (FTAs) with the US, Aus­tralia, the</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union and other economies, and wants to join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>REA­SONS FOR SUC­CESS</p>
    <p>Go­ing by the flurry of for­eign re­la­tions ac­tiv­i­ties in Taipei in re­cent months, in­clud­ing vis­its by high-level gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials from the US and Europe, Tai­wan has met with some suc­cess in its push­back against China’s ef­forts to iso­late it.</p>
    <p>Part of this suc­cess has to do with the global en­vi­ron­ment – the wors­en­ing ties be­tween the US and China, as well as Bei­jing’s grow­ing as­sertive­ness and its co­er­cive diplo­macy that have led to a back­lash among for­eign coun­tries.</p>
    <p>As re­la­tions be­tween</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing have de­te­ri­o­rated in the past few years and their ri­valry in the Indo-Pa­cific has grown, the US has sought to strengthen its ties with po­lit­i­cal en­ti­ties in the re­gion, in­clud­ing Tai­wan, with which it al­ready has a close if in­for­mal re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the US passed the Tai­wan Travel Act, which over­turned strict bans on of­fi­cial vis­its to Tai­wan. It paved the way for the visit last month of US Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar, the high­est-level Amer­i­can of­fi­cial to do so in four decades.</p>
    <p>In April, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump took Amer­i­can sup­port for Tai­wan a notch fur­ther by sign­ing into law the Tai­wan Al­lies In­ter­na­tional Protection and</p>
    <p>Enhancemen­t Ini­tia­tive (Taipei) Act. The Act states that the US gov­ern­ment should con­sider “in­creas­ing its eco­nomic, se­cu­rity and diplo­matic en­gage­ment with na­tions that have demon­stra­bly strength­ened, en­hanced or up­graded re­la­tions with Tai­wan”.</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers be­lieve the</p>
    <p>Taipei Act spurred So­ma­liland to up­grade its ties with Tai­wan de­spite pres­sure from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The US Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil cer­tainly made clear its sup­port for Tai­wan-So­ma­liland ties on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese re­sponse was re­port­edly a mix of in­duce­ments and threats. China’s am­bas­sador to Somalia vis­ited So­ma­liland Pres­i­dent Muse Bihi Abdi early last month, dur­ing which he of­fered a de­vel­op­ment deal, in­clud­ing road and air­port in­fra­struc­ture and the es­tab­lish­ment of a li­ai­son of­fice, if Mr Bihi would sever ties with Tai­wan. But it ap­pears that the Chi­nese en­voy also threat­ened con­se­quences if Mr Bihi did oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>Horn of Africa re­searcher Rashi Abdi tweeted around the time of the visit that the Chi­nese en­voy “started putting on the ‘war­rior diplo­macy’ act and threat­en­ing So­ma­liland” and was re­buffed by Mr Bihi.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, China scored an­other own goal in its use of co­er­cive diplo­macy to­wards for­eign lead­ers on the sub­ject of re­la­tions with Tai­wan. This time it had to do with Czech Repub­lic Se­nate pres­i­dent Mi­los Vys­tr­cil, who shrugged off Chi­nese pres­sure – in­clud­ing threats to pun­ish Czech com­pa­nies – to lead a del­e­ga­tion of 90 to Tai­wan late last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Vys­tr­cil is the No. 2 leader in the Czech Repub­lic and it is a rare move for coun­tries that have for­mal ties with China to send such a high-level of­fi­cial to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>True to form, Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi, who was vis­it­ing Europe then, did not mince his words. He warned that Mr Vys­tr­cil would pay a heavy price for “an un­en­durable provo­ca­tion”. The Czech am­bas­sador to Bei­jing was sum­moned. The Czech Repub­lic pushed back, sum­mon­ing the Chi­nese am­bas­sador in Prague.</p>
    <p>Al­though the China-friendly Czech Pres­i­dent Mi­los Ze­man later crit­i­cised the visit, Mr Wang’s re­sponse had the ef­fect of gal­vanis­ing other Euro­pean coun­tries to back Prague.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas, at a joint press con­fer­ence with Mr Wang in Ber­lin, said the EU stood shoul­der to shoul­der with the Czech gov­ern­ment. “In the Euro­pean Union, we deal with our in­ter­na­tional part­ners to­gether and with re­spect, and threats do not fit into that ap­proach,” said Mr Maas, whose re­marks are all the more re­mark­able given that Ger­many is China’s big­gest trad­ing part­ner and the Merkel gov­ern­ment has not been the most vo­cal critic of</p>
    <p>Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The Czech episode is in­struc­tive in high­light­ing some of the el­e­ments at play in Tai­wan’s bat­tle with China for greater in­ter­na­tional space and en­gage­ment with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>There is, for in­stance, the mat­ter of lever­age. It helps that Tai­wan is a more im­por­tant in­vestor in the Czech Repub­lic than China and there is lit­tle Bei­jing can do to pun­ish it eco­nom­i­cally. But that does not mean that China will not re­sort to its usual play­book. Last week, Bei­jing is­sued a warn­ing to its cit­i­zens to avoid vis­it­ing the Czech Repub­lic, cit­ing a surge in</p>
    <p>Covid-19 in­fec­tions there. But the move is likely to have lit­tle ef­fect given al­ready tight travel re­stric­tions by Prague on Chi­nese trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>The Czech Repub­lic also sees Tai­wan’s his­tory and democ­racy as a re­flec­tion of its own his­tor­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence and demo­cratic val­ues. This goes back to the time of for­mer free­dom fighter and pres­i­dent Va­clav Havel, who in the 1990s called for giv­ing Tai­wan a seat in the UN and played host to then Tai­wanese Pre­mier Lien Chan.</p>
    <p>WHAT THE FU­TURE HOLDS</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has thrown up new op­por­tu­ni­ties for Tai­wan to co­op­er­ate with other coun­tries and re­gions eco­nom­i­cally and in pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>As coun­tries around the world seek to build re­silience in their sup­ply chains and to re­duce their re­liance on China, Tai­wan is gear­ing it­self to be­come a man­u­fac­tur­ing hub for high-end pro­duc­tion pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, its trade de­vel­op­ment coun­cil reached an agree­ment with the Amer­i­can In­sti­tute in Tai­wan, the de facto US em­bassy, to work closer to­gether in mak­ing the global sup­ply chain more re­silient through en­cour­ag­ing part­ners to bring sup­ply chains closer to home or lo­cate them in like-minded economies.</p>
    <p>To build closer trade ties with the US, Tai­wan re­cently eased re­stric­tions on beef and pork imports from the coun­try, stick­ing points that had pre­vented ne­go­ti­a­tions on an FTA.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been suc­cess­ful early on in bring­ing its coro­n­avirus out­break un­der con­trol, Tai­wan has been donat­ing med­i­cal equip­ment and shar­ing its knowl­edge and ex­pe­ri­ence with Covid-19-hit coun­tries, in­clud­ing in Latin Amer­ica, Africa, West Asia and the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion. It is work­ing with US com­pa­nies to de­velop vac­cines and treat­ment for the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan also has a pro­gramme with the US, the Global</p>
    <p>Co­op­er­a­tion and Train­ing Frame­work, in which the two sides co-host ca­pac­ity-build­ing work­shops for the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion in ar­eas such as anti-cor­rup­tion ef­forts, me­dia lit­er­acy and women’s eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment. This is set to ex­pand, with Ja­pan hav­ing joined as a full part­ner.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s ef­forts to in­crease its in­ter­na­tional space have been helped in re­cent years by external cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>But there is no guar­an­tee that these will re­main as they are; if, for ex­am­ple, China-US ties were to im­prove, Wash­ing­ton may be less en­thu­si­as­tic about help­ing</p>
    <p>Tai­wan ex­pand its in­ter­na­tional space.</p>
    <p>But by build­ing sub­stan­tive ties with coun­tries and re­gions based on its own mer­its – whether through eco­nomic, so­cial or po­lit­i­cal ben­e­fits that it can bring to these re­la­tion­ships – Tai­wan is work­ing hard to en­sure that the in­ter­na­tional space it has fought hard for can en­dure.</p>
