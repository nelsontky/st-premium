    <p>MANILA • Grow­ing up in a rough neigh­bour­hood south of Manila, I once found my­self in a street fight with a boy my age. I was eight or nine at the time, and the older boys had pit­ted me against an op­po­nent to prove that I was man enough to join their gang.</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber that as I raised my fists, the boy in front of me, with men­ace in his eyes, said: “My fa­ther is Metro­com.”</p>
    <p>This was in the 1970s. The “Metro­com” was a po­lice in­tel­li­gence unit re­puted to be the “death squad” of dic­ta­tor Fer­di­nand Mar­cos’ regime. It was gen­er­ally be­lieved that if the Metro­com picked you up in the mid­dle of the night for be­ing a dis­si­dent, you would never be seen alive again.</p>
    <p>My op­po­nent was fir­ing off a warning: Beat me up and my fa­ther can make you dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>This was the mem­ory which came back to me af­ter I saw that now in­fa­mous five-minute video of an off-duty po­lice of­fi­cer killing in cold blood a mother and her son whom she was try­ing des­per­ately to pro­tect.</p>
    <p>That in­ci­dent took place at around 5pm on Dec 20, in a sleepy town 200km north of Manila. Sergeant Jonel Nuezca, 46, was in­volved in a heated ar­gu­ment with Mrs Sonya Gre­go­rio, 52, a teacher, over the noise her 25-year-old son An­thony was mak­ing with an air can­non fash­ioned out of a PVC pipe.</p>
    <p>There had al­ready been bad blood be­tween Nuezca and Mrs Gre­go­rio over a land dis­pute, neigh­bours said. The air can­non in­ci­dent brought things to a boil.</p>
    <p>About 30 min­utes af­ter the scuf­fle be­gan, Nuezca pulled out his 9mm pis­tol and shot Mrs Gre­go­rio in the head, in front of dozens of peo­ple, with at least two of them tak­ing videos with their phones. Nuezca then shot Mr Gre­go­rio, also in the head. Just be­fore flee­ing the scene, he again shot Mrs Gre­go­rio in the head as she was sprawled on the ground.</p>
    <p>What was disturbing about this was not just how mat­ter-of-factly the killings tran­spired, but the role that Nuezca’s daugh­ter, a minor, played in it.</p>
    <p>Just sec­onds be­fore Nuezca pulled the trig­ger, his daugh­ter ap­proached Mrs Gre­go­rio, tugged at the woman’s hair and told her to let go of her son.</p>
    <p>Mrs Gre­go­rio, dur­ing the scuf­fle, had her arms wrapped tightly around her son to pre­vent Nuezca from tak­ing him.</p>
    <p>“Just let go of him! Just let go!” Nuezca’s daugh­ter yelled. Mrs Gre­go­rio replied: “You tell (your fa­ther) to let go.”</p>
    <p>The girl then shouted, punc­tu­at­ing ev­ery word: “My fa­ther is a po­lice­man!”</p>
    <p>Mrs Gre­go­rio yelled back: “I don’t care!”</p>
    <p>Hours later, af­ter he sur­ren­dered, Nuezca was said to have con­fided in a fel­low po­lice­man: “I just lost it when</p>
    <p>I saw her (Mrs Gre­go­rio) shout­ing at my daugh­ter.”</p>
    <p>ARBITER OF WHO LIVES AND DIES</p>
    <p>Nuezca’s daugh­ter was pil­lo­ried by the on­line mob, as if she had pulled the trig­ger.</p>
    <p>A rel­a­tive of the vic­tims called her a “brat” and de­manded that she be sent to a de­ten­tion fa­cil­ity for ju­ve­nile delin­quents.</p>
    <p>But child rights ad­vo­cates have said she her­self is a vic­tim. Her be­hav­iour arose from how her fa­ther wanted her to see him.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bours said Nuezca was known for wad­ing into scuf­fles and tak­ing along his daugh­ter, so she could see for her­self how he wielded his au­thor­ity as an of­fi­cer of the law: as some­one who should be ac­qui­esced to and feared.</p>
    <p>That was ex­actly how she saw her fa­ther. That is also how most po­lice­men in the Philip­pines re­gard them­selves – with a bloated sense of en­ti­tle­ment and some­times as an arbiter of who lives and dies, with­out ac­count­abil­ity, es­pe­cially over those who are “no­bod­ies”.</p>
    <p>‘PRAETORIAN IN­TER­ESTS’</p>
    <p>It is gen­er­ally be­lieved that such malev­o­lence has plagued the po­lice since the late dic­ta­tor Mar­cos declared mar­tial law in 1972. To hold on to power, Mar­cos politi­cised the coun­try’s se­cu­rity ap­pa­ra­tus – both the po­lice and the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Mar­cos, in ex­change for their loy­alty, lav­ished on the men who ran the po­lice force and the mil­i­tary size­able perks and plum po­si­tions. He tol­er­ated cor­rup­tion within their ranks, and con­doned hu­man rights abuses by se­cu­rity forces that were of­ten com­mit­ted un­der the pre­text of na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“As the most au­ton­o­mous ele­ment of the Mar­cos regime, the Philip­pine de­fence estab­lish­ment de­rived last­ing ben­e­fits from au­thor­i­tar­ian rule. In­creased bud­gets, weapon pro­cure­ments, il­licit rack­ets, and the for­ma­tion of mili­tias en­riched and em­pow­ered the mil­i­tary to a point where it could no longer be con­trolled,” Mr Mes­rob Var­tavar­ian, a vis­it­ing fel­low at Cor­nell Univer­sity’s South-east Asia Pro­gramme, wrote in an anal­y­sis for the In­ter­na­tional In­sti­tute for Asian Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple Power re­volt in 1986 that ousted Mar­cos failed to cut down the out­sized role of the mil­i­tary and the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Their in­flu­ence, in fact, grew be­cause a coup led by se­nior mil­i­tary and po­lice of­fi­cials, who turned on Mar­cos, was piv­otal in that re­volt.</p>
    <p>These peo­ple later oc­cu­pied key posts in the rev­o­lu­tion­ary govern­ment of democ­racy icon Co­ra­zon Aquino and dragged it, lit­er­ally at gun­point, to the right with a suc­ces­sion of coups. While these coups were un­suc­cess­ful, they sig­nalled to suc­ceed­ing civil­ian gov­ern­ments that if they wanted to re­main in power, they would have to ac­com­mo­date what Mr Var­tavar­ian de­scribed as the “ex­tra-con­sti­tu­tional praetorian in­ter­ests” of the se­cu­rity ap­pa­ra­tus.</p>
    <p>‘PER­MIS­SION TO KILL’</p>
    <p>These in­ter­ests have been front and cen­tre un­der Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte, who took</p>
    <p>Mar­cos’ play­book and twisted it in even more disturbing ways.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte has re­moved re­straints that pre­vi­ous pres­i­dents worked so hard to put in place. He also set loose the mil­i­tary and the po­lice on what he sees as men­aces to his pol­i­tics – drug deal­ers, armed rebels and ev­ery­one else who stands in his way.</p>
    <p>He has promised to par­don any po­lice of­fi­cer found guilty of murder while car­ry­ing out his drug crack­down. He has dan­gled re­wards in ex­change for fealty to him and his cause: pay hikes and sidearms for rank-and-file sol­diers and po­lice­men, and plum govern­ment posts af­ter re­tire­ment for the gen­er­als and other se­nior of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>At least 59 re­tired gen­er­als, ad­mi­rals and colonels now oc­cupy posts in his Cab­i­net and key agen­cies, in­clud­ing govern­ment-owned cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte also of­ten pleads with the mil­i­tary and the po­lice not to stage a coup, in a nod to their roles as power-bro­kers.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have said that kind of pa­tron­age has been in­ter­preted as a “per­mis­sion to kill”, leading to a long, bloody trail.</p>
    <p>“What­ever dis­agree­ment there was, we used to agree that the so­lu­tion is to let the courts de­cide. Now, it doesn’t mat­ter,” said con­sti­tu­tional law pro­fes­sor John Molo at the state-run Univer­sity of the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>“Now, all it takes is the judg­ment of the men wield­ing the gun. Com­mu­nist, ad­dict, paid hack, re­sist­ing ar­rest, cocky. Any of these words is a death sen­tence,” he added.</p>
    <p>Over 8,000 drug sus­pects have been killed ei­ther by the po­lice or po­lice-backed vig­i­lantes in Mr Duterte’s bru­tal drug war.</p>
    <p>Rights groups have re­ported higher numbers, and said the vi­o­lence has con­tin­ued, even as the coun­try re­mains un­der a coro­n­avirus lock­down an­nounced in March.</p>
    <p>At least 300 politi­cians, lawyers, judges, jour­nal­ists, priests, aca­demics and stu­dents who were tagged as com­mu­nist sym­pa­this­ers have also died, as the mil­i­tary stepped up its anti-in­sur­gency drive.</p>
    <p>It is not sur­pris­ing, then, that on one un­re­mark­able af­ter­noon, an off-duty po­lice of­fi­cer hardly blinked when he shot, ex­e­cu­tion-style, a mother and her son even though he knew he was be­ing filmed.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Molo said: “It has come to this. The mon­ster is no longer afraid to show its face. It doesn’t care to hide in dark­ness any more. It will come for you at stop­lights or check­points for be­ing cocky. It will take you while in line at a store for be­ing rowdy. It will kill you, even as your en­tire com­mu­nity watches.”</p>
