    <p>I knew I should have done a bet­ter job pre­par­ing my son for Pri­mary 1 when his teacher asked me on our first meet­ing if he had spe­cial needs. The look of puz­zle­ment on my face prompted her to quickly ex­plain the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“Your boy does not look me in the eye when I’m talk­ing to him,” she said.</p>
    <p>Not look­ing some­one in the eye is usu­ally an early sign of autism, which I knew – with very lit­tle sci­en­tific ba­sis – my son did not have.</p>
    <p>What he had was some low-level so­cial anx­i­ety, shy­ness, and that is what I told the teacher.</p>
    <p>I was prob­a­bly right, she said, be­cause apart from not keep­ing eye con­tact, my son was able to grasp what was said in class, and although he looked dis­tracted, was fully at­tuned to ev­ery­thing that was go­ing on around him.</p>
    <p>None of this was news to me. Somewhere in the four years he spent in nurs­ery and kinder­garten, my son in­ex­pli­ca­bly be­came ex­tremely shy with peo­ple out­side the im­me­di­ate fam­ily.</p>
    <p>He would run off to his room when there were guests, and pack away his clown­ish, in­quis­i­tive per­sona from pub­lic view, re­serv­ing it for only a small cir­cle of close friends and fam­ily mem­bers he knew well and was com­fort­able with.</p>
    <p>For ev­ery­one else, he pressed the mute but­ton.</p>
    <p>There were no cart­wheels in the buff, no gar­ru­lous talk on the likely win­ner in a con­test be­tween great white shark and killer whale, no songs in an un­known lan­guage, de­liv­ered with full-throated gusto.</p>
    <p>Greet­ing vis­i­tors in a small voice and fac­ing away, he would try to fuse him­self to my body, and oc­ca­sion­ally whis­per in my ear ques­tions or com­ments.</p>
    <p>We put it down to a pass­ing phase, but when he went to pri­mary school, it turned into a prob­lem dur­ing class pre­sen­ta­tions and other ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>An­other is­sue was his hand­writ­ing. His English teacher be­moaned his scrawl­ing, un­even, non-lin­ear hand­writ­ing that bulged out of the lines, of­ten grow­ing into il­leg­i­ble, mon­strous shape po­ems.</p>
    <p>In pre-school, feed­back from my son’s teach­ers verged mostly on the ex­em­plary, and nei­ther me nor my wife felt there were any ar­eas we needed to ad­dress as he moved on to pri­mary school, which – it soon be­came ap­par­ent – de­manded a set of skills he hadn’t quite got a han­dle on.</p>
    <p>Wor­ries that cen­tred on his abil­ity to cope with the cur­ricu­lum and hav­ing the dis­ci­pline to keep up with school­work proved un­founded – home­work is still al­ways done without prompt­ing and there have been a few aca­demic prizes along the way.</p>
    <p>My wife and I placed lit­tle or no im­por­tance on week­end en­rich­ment classes and never thought to foray into the buzzing speech and drama cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>In­stead, free time without gad­gets – for play, read­ing and romp­ing about out­doors – is what our chil­dren would have more of, we de­cided.</p>
    <p>In those early months my son was in Pri­mary 1, I of­ten won­dered if we had made the right de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>It was still not too late, I would some­times think, for pub­lic-speak­ing work­shops and brand-name hot-hous­ing on week­ends.</p>
    <p>In­stead, we de­cided to ex­plain why it was im­por­tant to make eye con­tact when talk­ing to some­one.</p>
    <p>It was just be­fore the half­way mark of that first year in pri­mary school that my son be­gan show­ing signs that he might not re­main a shrink­ing vi­o­let for much longer.</p>
    <p>At a con­cert or­gan­ised by the school’s Tamil lan­guage depart­ment, my wife and I saw for the first time my son singing on stage, first in a group per­for­mance, then as part of a trio. He was all smiles, dul­cet tones and full of brio.</p>
    <p>His tal­ent-spot­ting Tamil teacher did not stop there. She put him on a per­for­mance spree, sign­ing him up for Tamil drama and singing com­pe­ti­tions, or­gan­ised by lo­cal schools and community groups.</p>
    <p>It was mostly touch and go at the singing con­tests, his voice fi­nally emerg­ing af­ter the ini­tial void of com­plete si­lence that punc­tu­ated the start of each per­for­mance. And all things con­sid­ered, it was usu­ally a com­mend­able ef­fort. More to the point, his Tamil started to get bet­ter in tan­dem with his con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Drama fests were trick­ier. He prac­tised with fer­vour in the lead-up to the first one his teacher signed him up for, but on the day it­self, in front of the judges, par­ents and other pupils, he mum­bled his lines in a race to the end, eyes fixed firmly on some­one’s shoes.</p>
    <p>No more drama for me, Appa, he said.</p>
    <p>But in Pri­mary 2 last year, his English teacher said in a rou­tine meet­ing that he showed some real tal­ent dur­ing class­room sketch ac­tiv­i­ties, play­ing dif­fer­ent char­ac­ters, and chang­ing his voice and man­ner­isms to suit each one.</p>
    <p>Sign him up for speech and drama classes, she said. Af­ter some dis­cus­sion, he opted to join the school’s drama club, and it ap­pears that the last traces of so­cial anx­i­ety and shy­ness have been oblit­er­ated.</p>
    <p>His hand­writ­ing is now leg­i­ble, neat and con­tained within the lines – in the end hew­ing to the strict de­mands of his teach­ers.</p>
    <p>What I am most pleased about is how my son’s early school years have been a pos­i­tive, trans­for­ma­tive jour­ney of growth.</p>
    <p>Any no­tion that a child should en­ter Pri­mary 1 fully pre­pared for the rigours that await, it seems to me, de­feats the pur­pose of school – a rite of pas­sage for a child to de­velop his or her full po­ten­tial in aca­demics as well as char­ac­ter, val­ues and so on.</p>
    <p>Con­tained within this ex­pe­ri­ence is the joy of self-dis­cov­ery and a con­fi­dence built from scal­ing new heights and find­ing new hori­zons at a pace that suits the child.</p>
    <p>My son’s ex­pe­ri­ence is also proof that our teach­ers – with sharp eyes and ears – are equal to the task of spot­ting gaps in a child’s de­vel­op­ment and find­ing ways to help him dis­cover a bet­ter ver­sion of him­self.</p>
