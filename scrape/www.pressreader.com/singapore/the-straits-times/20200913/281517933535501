    <p>For over five years, Siti (not her real name) would start her 16-hour work day at 5.30am clean­ing her em­ployer’s five-room flat on the 10th storey, fol­lowed by the five­room flat of her em­ployer’s mother one floor be­low.</p>
    <p>The then novice maid en­dured the ar­range­ment, clean­ing and cook­ing for both house­holds in Ang Mo Kio be­tween 2010 and 2015.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ex­haus­tion from chores that had her work­ing past 9.30pm ev­ery day – with only a half-hour re­prieve for lunch – the East Java na­tive, now 35, never re­ported the il­licit de­ploy­ment to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“I knew it was not cor­rect but I was young and new. I was afraid to get in trou­ble with (the em­ployer) be­cause I thought I would get black­listed. I felt I could not speak up so I just fol­lowed,” she said.</p>
    <p>“My pur­pose here is to work and make money, not to make trou­ble.”</p>
    <p>The work­load even­tu­ally be­came un­bear­able, and she asked to go home. Two months later, she got in touch with an­other agency and re­turned to Sin­ga­pore – and to a new em­ployer.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of maids be­ing il­le­gally de­ployed came un­der the spot­light af­ter Ms Parti Liyani, a for­mer maid em­ployed by Mr Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily, was ac­quit­ted of steal­ing from them. Mr Liew last week stepped down as chair­man of Changi Air­port Group and Sur­bana Jurong, as well as from posts in two other or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti had been asked to clean the home and of­fice of Mr Liew’s son Karl Liew, and the judge found that there was rea­son to be­lieve the Liews had pre-emp­tively ter­mi­nated her em­ploy­ment and lodged a po­lice re­port al­leg­ing theft af­ter she threat­ened to re­port the il­le­gal de­ploy­ment to the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>While of­fi­cial fig­ures show il­le­gal de­ploy­ment of for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers (FDWs) here to be a mi­nor prob­lem, in­ter­views with a dozen maids here paint a dif­fer­ent pic­ture.</p>
    <p>Seven of the 12 maids The Sun­day Times spoke to had been asked by an em­ployer to per­form chores in an­other household. None of them had re­ported the is­sue to MOM.</p>
    <p>Like Siti, they cited not hav­ing a com­plete un­der­stand­ing of the rules, fear of reper­cus­sions and a feel­ing of fu­til­ity as rea­sons for not blow­ing the whis­tle.</p>
    <p>One maid, who wanted to be known as Diyah, said five of her pre­vi­ous em­ploy­ers asked her to work in other fam­ily mem­bers’ house­holds or their work­places.</p>
    <p>She said she was un­aware of the rules dur­ing her stints with her first two em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Her third em­ployer claimed to have MOM’s ap­proval, de­spite never con­sult­ing her on the ar­range­ment, and Diyah said she did not know how to ver­ify this.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Surabaya na­tive Lara was asked not only to tend to two house­holds i n the same con­do­minium, but also to clean an of­fice monthly over an eight-month stint. She told her agency about the mul­ti­ple de­ploy­ments at the end of her stint, but was un­sure if the mat­ter was ever re­ported to MOM.</p>
    <p>“I was still in de­duc­tion at that time,” she said, re­fer­ring to the ini­tial pe­riod when part of her salary would go to the agency. “I didn’t want a lot of trou­ble be­cause my boss’ wife had a tem­per, so I just wanted to fin­ish the de­duc­tion and swal­low it. I knew it was not right.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, em­ploy­ers must en­sure that do­mes­tic helpers per­form only household and do­mes­tic du­ties, and can work for their em­ployer only at the ad­dress stated on their work per­mit.</p>
    <p>MOM said last week that be­tween 2017 and 2019, it re­ceived an av­er­age of 550 cases a year of maids be­ing made to work il­le­gally by their em­ploy­ers or household mem­bers. That is 0.2 per cent of the more than 236,000 em­ploy­ers of FDWs here, it added.</p>
    <p>Three quar­ters of the cases were brought to the min­istry’s at­ten­tion by third par­ties, while the rest were com­plaints lodged by the maids them­selves, MOM said in re­sponse to me­dia queries.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that upon in­ves­ti­ga­tion, the ma­jor­ity of cases were FDWs who had been de­ployed with their charges – ei­ther chil­dren or se­niors – to the homes of close fam­ily mem­bers to pro­vide care there. This is per­mit­ted so long as the helpers ac­cept the ar­range­ments, are not re­quired to per­form the household chores of two fam­i­lies, and have their well-be­ing taken care of, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Those found guilty of il­le­gally de­ploy­ing an FDW can be fined up to $10,000 in the first in­stance, and be banned from em­ploy­ing FDWs.</p>
    <p>MOM said ev­ery al­le­ga­tion is treated se­ri­ously and looked into, but did not elab­o­rate on what its thresh­old for pros­e­cu­tion is. In se­ri­ous cases, such as those where FDWs are reg­u­larly de­ployed to do non-do­mes­tic work or to work on com­mer­cial premises over a long pe­riod, em­ploy­ers can be fined and also de­barred from hir­ing FDWs, it added.</p>
    <p>Ms K. Jayaprema, pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Em­ploy­ment Agen­cies (Sin­ga­pore) ar­gued that the re­spon­si­bil­ity for curb­ing ex­ploita­tion of FDWs ought to be shared among stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“We have to in­stil in every­body this re­spon­si­bil­ity to stick with the rules about il­le­gal em­ploy­ment and de­ploy­ment... We need to send a strong sig­nal to ev­ery for­eign worker and em­ployer in Sin­ga­pore so that ev­ery­one falls in line.”</p>
    <p>But non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGOs) pointed out that the power asym­me­try be­tween em­ployer and maid, as well as fear of re­tal­ia­tory ac­tion, means many cases likely go un­re­ported, es­pe­cially if em­ploy­ers push the en­ve­lope of what is al­lowed with­out en­ter­ing egre­gious ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>“Work­ers of­ten agree to par­take in such ac­tiv­i­ties (even if they know it is il­le­gal) as they are afraid of be­ing scolded or ter­mi­nated if they refuse, as there ex­ists an un­equal bal­ance of power be­tween the worker and the em­ployer,” said a spokesman for the Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­grant Eco­nom­ics (Home).</p>
    <p>“Fac­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing sanc­tioned will also pre­vent them from mak­ing com­plaints to MOM.”</p>
    <p>For­eign Do­mes­tic Worker As­so­ci­a­tion for Social Sup­port and Train­ing (Fast), re­fer­ring to MOM’s ad­vice for em­ploy­ers to work out a job scope with the helper when they have to visit other fam­ily mem­bers, said: “On the ground, the ex­e­cu­tion of th­ese un­der­stand­ings and agree­ments may be dif­fer­ent from one fam­ily to the next. While Fast has seen cases of mis­un­der­stand­ing, it does not re­flect the over­ar­ch­ing sen­ti­ments of the FDW-em­ployer re­la­tion­ship in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>While Ms Parti stood firm against her ac­cusers af­ter her threat of lodg­ing a re­port with MOM os­ten­si­bly led to crim­i­nal ac­cu­sa­tions against her, many FDWs would have cho­sen to plead guilty and move on, given the fi­nan­cial and other con­straints, said lawyer Anil Balchan­dani, who worked on Ms</p>
    <p>Parti’s case pro bono.</p>
    <p>“They feel that it’s con­ve­nient or they are given the im­pres­sion that it’s just con­ve­nient to apol­o­gise and plead guilty, and they’ll be sent home, which is what they re­ally want af­ter a lit­tle while of be­ing ac­cused and in­ter­ro­gated,” he said in an in­ter­view with Home. “And that in it­self is an in­jus­tice.”</p>
    <p>The Cen­tre for Do­mes­tic Em­ploy­ees said it is in the self-in­ter­est of em­ploy­ers to en­sure their do­mes­tic work­ers do not face stress or burnout from over­work, whether caused by work­ing in two lo­ca­tions or ad­di­tional chores.</p>
    <p>“If the FDW feels tired due to over­work, the risk of sus­tain­ing an in­jury increases,” said the cen­tre, which was set up by the Na­tional Trades Union Congress. The em­ployer would then be re­spon­si­ble for the non-sub­sidised medical treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Of course, not all do­mes­tic work­ers who were il­le­gally de­ployed had neg­a­tive ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>One 41-year-old helper told ST that she is happy to clean the home of her em­ployer’s mother twice a week for an ex­tra $50, as the chil­dren i n her care have grown up and her orig­i­nal work­load has fallen.</p>
    <p>“It’s not too tir­ing, and my em­ployer is very un­der­stand­ing and doesn’t rush me to come home. Usu­ally, on those days she won’t make me cook din­ner,” said the In­done­sian from Se­marang, Cen­tral Java.</p>
    <p>But such cases where both par­ties are happy are “very rare”, said Ms Um­mai Um­mairoh, pres­i­dent of sup­port group In­done­sian Fam­ily Net­work. “Even if the helper tells the em­ployer she is okay with it, many say yes and ac­cept the money be­cause they are scared,” she said.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, Ms Um­mai hopes to see bet­ter com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers and em­ploy­ers, and stricter ad­her­ence to the rules.</p>
    <p>“Things are bet­ter than in the past be­cause of all the com­plaints and (the work of) NGOs, but there still needs to be a lot more sup­port be­cause we still see a lot of cases, and helpers ask for sup­port be­cause they are ex­hausted,” she said.</p>
    <p>FEAR OF REPER­CUS­SIONS</p>
    <p>I knew it was not cor­rect but I was young and new. I was afraid to get in trou­ble... be­cause I thought I would get black­listed. I felt I could not speak up.</p>
