    <p>Le­ices­ter City are fourth in the Premier League but Bren­dan Rodgers has brushed off sug­ges­tions of a ti­tle chase, in­sist­ing that se­cur­ing a Euro­pean spot is the pri­or­ity for his team.</p>
    <p>The Foxes have kept pace with the lead­ers do­mes­ti­cally de­spite the tolls of Europa League games. They are on 29 points, four be­hind Liver­pool and Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>Rodgers’ men are through to the last 32 of the Europa League and will face Slavia Prague next month, and he be­lieves that to qual­ify for Europe again at the end of this cam­paign with a heav­ier sched­ule would be a “great suc­cess”.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at his pre-match press con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s Premier League clash at New­cas­tle, the 47-year-old said: “I’m al­ways hon­est and let you know what we’re think­ing, and our think­ing is if we can have Euro­pean foot­ball again next sea­son, with the stage that the team is at in its de­vel­op­ment, that would be a great suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“With all due re­spect to the teams above us, the likes of Manch­ester City and Liver­pool, these teams are fan­tas­tic teams full of ex­pe­ri­enced play­ers who have been build­ing for a num­ber of years. We’re not at that level. That’s my hon­est as­sess­ment of it.</p>
    <p>“We’re build­ing some­thing to be as com­pet­i­tive as we can pos­si­bly be with­out the fi­nances that al­lows those teams to get to that level. We’ll con­tinue on that jour­ney.</p>
    <p>“The am­bi­tion is there, the spirit is there, so that’s some­thing that pleases me.”</p>
    <p>At St James’ Park, Le­ices­ter will hope for a re­peat of last sea­son’s new year opener, which ended with a 3-0 vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Rodgers is likely to ro­tate his side again af­ter rest­ing play­ers for the 1-1 draw with Crys­tal Palace.</p>
    <p>Wesley Fo­fana, Ti­mothy Castagne, Wil­fred Ndidi, Youri Tiele­mans, James Mad­di­son and Jamie Vardy are ex­pected to come back into the side.</p>
    <p>New­cas­tle man­ager Steve Bruce, mean­while, is wary of the threat the Foxes can pose when they are play­ing away.</p>
    <p>He said: “For Le­ices­ter, away from home, maybe it suits them bet­ter be­cause they can play slightly on the counter-at­tack... if you leave spa­ces in be­hind, Jamie Vardy is as good as you’re go­ing to play against as a cen­tre for­ward.”</p>
