    <p>Sin­ga­pore has topped the Smart City In­dex for the sec­ond year run­ning, with the team be­hind the rank­ing say­ing that smart cities head­ing the list had han­dled the Covid-19 pan­demic bet­ter.</p>
    <p>This year’s rank­ings took into ac­count how 109 cities tapped tech­nol­ogy in a last­ing way to man­age the coron­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic’s re­sponse to the cri­sis was note­wor­thy, Swiss busi­ness school In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment Devel­op­ment (IMD) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ar­turo Bris, direc­tor of the World Com­pet­i­tive­ness Cen­tre at IMD, added in a state­ment: “We have watched Sin­ga­pore’s per­for­mance over the last 12 months and have di­rectly cor­re­lated Sin­ga­pore’s con­tin­ued suc­cess as this prompt re­sponse to an un­ex­pected chal­lenge where other cities have fal­tered.”</p>
    <p>The city state, said Prof Bris, had acted quickly and de­ci­sively.</p>
    <p>“It had a clear road map that it fol­lowed but re­mained flex­i­ble. The cit­i­zens were kept in­formed and there­fore on board with the deci</p>
    <p>sions and the loss of free­dom that these en­tailed.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment was in po­si­tion to pro­vide ad­e­quate com­pen­sa­tion to those los­ing out and did this wisely.”</p>
    <p>The sur­vey find­ings noted that a cen­tral pil­lar of Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess has been its “re­silience and prompt­ness when con­fronted with the un­ex­pected chal­lenges brought by the</p>
    <p>pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>IMD said: “As an ex­am­ple, over 77 per cent of the sam­ple sur­veyed agreed that in­for­ma­tion was clear and easy to ac­cess con­cern­ing the clar­ity and eas­i­ness of ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion on gov­ern­ment de­ci­sions.”</p>
    <p>Prof Bris said that cities with bet­ter tech­nol­ogy have man­aged the pan­demic bet­ter, but added:</p>
    <p>“Smart cities are not the so­lu­tion, but tech­nol­ogy helps.”</p>
    <p>The in­dex, which ranks cities by eco­nomic and tech­no­log­i­cal data, was pub­lished by IMD in part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign.</p>
    <p>It took into ac­count cit­i­zens’ per­cep­tions of how “smart” their cities are.</p>
    <p>The team sur­veyed 120 res­i­dents</p>
    <p>in each city on their ideas of two pil­lars – struc­tures, re­fer­ring to ex­ist­ing in­fra­struc­ture; and tech­nol­ogy, in terms of the tech­no­log­i­cal pro­vi­sions and ser­vices avail­able to cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Each pil­lar was then eval­u­ated over five key ar­eas: health and safety, mo­bil­ity, ac­tiv­i­ties, op­por­tu­ni­ties, and gover­nance.</p>
    <p>“Re­flected in this year’s rank­ings is that cities have ever dif­fer­ing ap­proaches to tech­nol­ogy as man­ag­ing the pan­demic has be­come in­creas­ingly im­por­tant in lo­cal pol­i­tics,” said IMD.</p>
    <p>On this point, it noted that cities in In­dia (New Delhi, Mum­bai, Hy­der­abad and Ben­galuru) suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant drops in the rank­ings this year.</p>
    <p>“This can be at­trib­uted to the detri­men­tal ef­fect that the pan­demic has had where the tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ment was not up to date. In­dian cities have suf­fered more from the pan­demic be­cause they were not pre­pared.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, a com­mon fac­tor be­hind the drop in all In­dian cities is a gen­eral de­cline ex­pe­ri­enced by all of them in the qual­ity of in­fra­struc­ture of the cities de­spite the tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tions im­ple­mented to ad­vanc­ing it.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is one of two Asian cities in the top 10, with Taipei mov­ing down one notch to eighth place.</p>
