    <p>LON­DON • Re­searchers yes­ter­day called for more study on us­ing blood from re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients – or so-called con­va­les­cent plasma – as a po­ten­tial treat­ment, af­ter a small trial of hos­pi­talised pa­tients in In­dia found no ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>The In­dian study re­sults, pub­lished in the BMJ Bri­tish Med­i­cal Jour­nal, f ound that the plasma, which de­liv­ers an­ti­bod­ies from Covid-19 sur­vivors to in­fected peo­ple, did not help hos­pi­talised pa­tients fight off the in­fec­tion, and failed to re­duce death rates or halt pro­gres­sion to se­vere dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The find­ings are a set­back for a po­ten­tial ther­apy that US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had touted in Au­gust as a “his­toric break­through”, and one that ex­perts say has al­ready been used in some 100,000 pa­tients in the United States de­spite lim­ited ev­i­dence of its ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists not di­rectly in­volved in the In­dia study, which in­volved around 460 pa­tients, said that its re­sults were dis­ap­point­ing, but that did not mean doc­tors should give up hope on it al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>They said fur­ther and larger tri­als are needed, i nclud­ing i n Covid-19 pa­tients with a milder form of the dis­ease and those newly in­fected.</p>
    <p>“With just a few hun­dred pa­tients, (the In­dia trial) is still much too small to give clear re­sults,” said pro­fes­sor of medicine and epi­demi­ol­ogy Martin Lan­dray from Bri­tain’s Ox­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“One could imag­ine that the treat­ment might work par­tic­u­larly well in those ear­lier in the course of the dis­ease or who have not been able to mount a good an­ti­body re­sponse to the virus of their own,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But such spec­u­la­tion needs to be tested – we can’t just rely on an ed­u­cated guess.”</p>
    <p>The In­dian re­searchers en­rolled 464 adults with Covid-19 who were ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tals across the coun­try be­tween April and July.</p>
    <p>They were ran­domly split into two groups – with one re­ceiv­ing two trans­fu­sions of con­va­les­cent plasma along­side best stan­dard care, and the other get­ting only best stan­dard care.</p>
    <p>Af­ter seven days, use of con­va­les­cent plasma seemed to im­prove some symp­toms, such as short­ness of breath and fa­tigue, and led to higher rates of so­called neg­a­tive con­ver­sion – a sign that the virus is be­ing neu­tralised by an­ti­bod­ies. But this did not trans­late into a re­duc­tion in deaths or pro­gres­sion to se­vere dis­ease by 28 days.</p>
    <p>Read­ing Univer­sity’s pro­fes­sor of vi­rol­ogy Ian Jones agreed with Prof Lan­dray that plasma may be more likely to work very soon af­ter some­one con­tracts Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He urged re­searchers to con­tinue to con­duct tri­als, and to do so in newly di­ag­nosed pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“We still do not have enough treat­ments for the early stage of dis­ease to pre­vent se­vere dis­ease and, un­til this be­comes an op­tion, avoid­ing be­ing in­fected with the virus re­mains the key mes­sage,” he said.</p>
