    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States econ­omy bounced back with a record yet tem­po­rary surge of growth in the third quar­ter as busi­nesses re­opened and stim­u­lus cash pow­ered con­sumer spend­ing, re­vers­ing much of the col­lapse stem­ming from coro­n­avirus-en­forced lock­downs.</p>
    <p>US gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) for July to last month ex­panded at a 33.1 per cent an­nu­alised pace, af­ter a 31.4 per cent plunge in the se­cond quar­ter, the Com­merce Depart­ment’s ini­tial es­ti­mate showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This beat economists’ es­ti­mates for a 32 per cent in­crease.</p>
    <p>The mas­sive gain – the big­gest since record-keep­ing started in 1947 – was driven by a surge in spend­ing by con­sumers and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>But economists warn that much of that was fu­elled by the mas­sive US$3 tril­lion (S$4.1 tril­lion) in gov­ern­ment aid that flooded the econ­omy in the early weeks of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Much of that fund­ing to job­less work­ers and busi­nesses has run out, and other data shows spend­ing ta­pered off last month and the re­cov­ery is los­ing mo­men­tum.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts cau­tion that growth will be much more mod­est and choppy in months to come, es­pe­cially as the spread of the virus gath­ers pace again and US law­mak­ers re­main in an ex­tended dead­lock over a new stim­u­lus pack­age.</p>
    <p>More­over, there are still nearly 11 mil­lion fewer work­ers on pay­rolls than there were be­fore the pan­demic hit, and an­a­lysts say a full re­cov­ery in GDP is at least sev­eral quar­ters away.</p>
    <p>Even with the out­size gain, GDP is 3.5 per cent below its pre-pan­demic peak, and the virus will keep busi­nesses and jobs de­pressed in sec­tors like travel and res­tau­rants.</p>
    <p>A separate re­port yes­ter­day showed ap­pli­ca­tions for US state un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits fell more than fore­cast last week.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial j ob­less claims to­talled 751,000 in the week ended last Satur­day, down 40,000 from the prior week, Labour Depart­ment data showed.</p>
    <p>Economists called for 770,000 ini­tial claims and 7.78 mil­lion con­tin­u­ing claims, ac­cord­ing to the me­dian es­ti­mates in Bloomberg sur­veys.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures, the last snap­shot of the US labour mar­ket ahead of Tues­day’s elec­tion, un­der­score a fur­ther, yet grad­ual, re­cov­ery in the job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, a re­newed surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions across the coun­try and a dead­lock over new fis­cal stim­u­lus threaten to limit fur­ther progress.</p>
    <p>With just five days un­til elec­tion day, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump will likely point to the lat­est fig­ures as ev­i­dence of his abil­ity to guide the Amer­i­can econ­omy through the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear, though, how much of an im­pact the up­beat fig­ures may have on the elec­tion, es­pe­cially given that more than 76 mil­lion Amer­i­cans have al­ready cast their vote.</p>
    <p>US stocks were mixed af­ter trad­ing opened yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The S&P 500 edged higher by 0.2 per cent, as the eco­nomic data al­layed some wor­ries but ad­vances were capped as the num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases con­tin­ues to rise. The Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age fell 38.97 points, or 0.15 per cent.</p>
    <p>Wall Street had plunged on Wed­nes­day amid con­cerns over Covid-19’s resur­gence and its po­ten­tial im­pact on the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Asian stock mar­kets also fell yes­ter­day but not as sharply on the sense that the re­gion had Covid-19 more un­der con­trol. MSCI’s broad­est in­dex of Asia-Pa­cific shares out­side Ja­pan lost 0.6 per cent, while the Straits Times In­dex dropped 1.3 per cent.</p>
