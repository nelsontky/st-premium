    <p>• Two lux­ury Bei­jing apart­ments seized from mar­tial arts film star Jackie Chan will be put up for auc­tion due to an own­er­ship dis­pute, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments seen by Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
    <p>The ac­tion star sparked con­tro­versy i n 2013 when he j oined China’s top po­lit­i­cal ad­vi­sory body de­spite be­ing born in Hong Kong, where his rep­u­ta­tion has taken a beat­ing over his pro-Bei­jing stance.</p>
    <p>Chan, 66, his wife Joan Lin, 67, and son Jaycee Chan, 37, have lived in the high-end prop­er­ties since 2007.</p>
    <p>But a le­gal dis­pute between two real es­tate firms has re­sulted in the prop­er­ties be­ing com­man­deered and put up for sale, de­spite ap­peals by the star who is best known for the hit movie se­ries Rush Hour (1998 to 2007) and Po­lice Story (1985 to 2013)</p>
    <p>Chan signed an agree­ment with Yu­jia Real Es­tate in 2006 to buy the two units, which cover more than 1,200 sq m, ac­cord­ing to a court judg­ment pub­lished in July.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor paid 13 mil­lion yuan – a 20.6 mil­lion yuan dis­count over the orig­i­nal pur­chase price, in ex­change for a celebrity en­dorse­ment of the com­pound in a prime area of cen­tral Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>But court pa­pers out­line prob­lems in­clud­ing a change in Yu­jia’s company name, as well as tax ar­rears, which de­layed the trans­fer of the prop­erty rights to Chan.</p>
    <p>An­other de­vel­oper, Ten­hong Real Es­tate, later filed for ar­bi­tra­tion with Yu­jia to set­tle debts and the two prop­er­ties were among those seized in 2017.</p>
    <p>An on­line list­ing has the price of the two flats in the Chi­nese cap­i­tal as start­ing from 71.9 mil­lion yuan (S$14.3 mil­lion), with bid­ding to be­gin later this month.</p>
    <p>A vir­tual tour of the prop­erty showed a maze-like space with a pool ta­ble, at least two walk-in wardrobes, a wine fridge and a framed photograph of Chan meet­ing for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty was also the scene of a 2014 drug scan­dal in­volv­ing Chan’s son Jaycee, who served six months in a Chi­nese prison af­ter he was found to be pro­vid­ing a venue for oth­ers to use drugs and in pos­ses­sion of 100g of mar­i­juana.</p>
    <p>The prop­er­ties are now val­ued at more than 100 mil­lion yuan, ac­cord­ing to the auc­tion list­ing.</p>
