    <p>BEI­JING • One of China’s front-run­ning coro­n­avirus vac­cine can­di­dates was shown to be safe and trig­gered im­mune re­sponses in a com­bined early- and mid-stage test in hu­mans, re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial vac­cine, dubbed BBIBP-CorV, is be­ing de­vel­oped by the Bei­jing In­sti­tute of Bi­o­log­i­cal Prod­ucts, a sub­sidiary of the China Na­tional Biotec Group (CNBG).</p>
    <p>It has al­ready been ap­proved for an emer­gency in­oc­u­la­tion pro­gramme in China tar­get­ing es­sen­tial work­ers and other lim­ited groups of peo­ple fac­ing high in­fec­tion risk.</p>
    <p>How­ever, whether the shot can safely pro­tect peo­ple from the dis­ease will be­come clear only when fi­nal Phase 3 tri­als – which are on­go­ing out­side China – are com­plete.</p>
    <p>Separately, a US$60 (S$81.50) dou­ble-dose ex­per­i­men­tal coro­n­avirus vac­cine is be­ing made avail­able to some res­i­dents in an eastern Chi­nese city, health of­fi­cials have said – the first de­tails of a mass roll­out for an as-yet un­proven vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in Ji­ax­ing city said on Thurs­day that res­i­dents aged between 18 and 59 with “ur­gent needs” can seek con­sul­ta­tions at clin­ics for a Si­no­vac Biotech vac­cine that the au­thor­i­ties have been giv­ing to groups such as med­i­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties did not say how many in the city had been given the vac­cine, which comes in two doses, ad­min­is­tered up to 28 days apart and cost­ing 400 yuan (S$81.50).</p>
    <p>BBIBP-CorV is one of at least 10 coro­n­avirus vac­cine projects glob­ally to have en­tered Phase 3 tri­als, four of which are led by Chi­nese sci­en­tists, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>It did not cause any se­vere side ef­fects, while com­mon mild or mod­er­ate ad­verse re­ac­tions in­cluded fever and pain in in­jec­tion sites, ac­cord­ing to a pa­per pub­lished on Thurs­day in med­i­cal jour­nal The Lancet.</p>
    <p>The re­sults came from a com­bined Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial in­volv­ing more than 600 healthy adults con­ducted between April 29 and July 30.</p>
    <p>Two in­jec­tions of BBIBP-CorV at three dif­fer­ent doses gen­er­ated an­ti­bod­ies in all re­cip­i­ents of each group, in­clud­ing older par­tic­i­pants, although the data does not prove the vac­cine is ef­fi­ca­cious, re­searchers at the CNBG sub­sidiary, Chi­nese dis­ease con­trol au­thor­i­ties and other re­search in­sti­tutes said in the pa­per.</p>
