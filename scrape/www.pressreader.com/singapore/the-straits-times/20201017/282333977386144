    <p>• Hakim Ziyech, signed for £33.3 mil­lion (S$58.3 mil­lion) from Ajax, has yet to play a game for Chelsea as a knee in­jury ruled him out of the start of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old is get­ting closer to mak­ing his bow for the Blues, and Frank Lampard ex­pressed his op­ti­mism yes­ter­day as he is ea­ger to see how the for­ward can link up with the team’s at­tack.</p>
    <p>“It feels like a long time since we brought him here,” the Chelsea boss said of Ziyech, who was signed in Fe­bru­ary but joined the squad only in July.</p>
    <p>“He’s worked hard to get fit. He looks good in train­ing. It’s just game min­utes that we need now.”</p>
    <p>Ziyech “will get some min­utes we hope”, Lampard added.</p>
    <p>Chelsea host Southamp­ton in the Pre­mier League to­day, fol­low­ing an un­con­vinc­ing run of two wins, a draw and a loss in their first four league matches.</p>
    <p>New sign­ings Timo Werner and Kai Havertz failed to score in any of those fix­tures, and Ziyech’s cre­ativ­ity is seen as a key to get­ting the best out of the Ger­man duo, at the same time pro­vid­ing bal­ance to Chris­tian Pulisic on the left.</p>
    <p>“We’re look­ing to build re­la­tion­ships all over the pitch,” Lampard added. “Those things can only be worked on. We’re see­ing play­ers we got in are get­ting fit. We’ve a lot of work to do. Not the end prod­uct. There are teams that have shown how long it takes to be a top team. We’re at the start of that jour­ney. The work has be­gun but it con­tin­ues.”</p>
    <p>He con­firmed that goal­keeper Edouard Mendy is still un­fit, while Thi­ago Silva will not be in the squad af­ter play­ing for Brazil in World Cup qualifiers.</p>
    <p>For Southamp­ton, Stu­art Arm­strong and Moussa Djenepo will miss the trip but man­ager Ralph Hasen­huettl sees this as an op­por­tu­nity to hand dead­line-day sign­ing Theo Wal­cott his de­but.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton loa­nee Wal­cott, 31, has re­turned to his boy­hood club on a sea­son-long deal.</p>
