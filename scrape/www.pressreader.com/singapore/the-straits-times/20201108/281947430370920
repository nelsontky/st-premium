    <p>Mr M. Ravi al­leged in the Face­book post that Sin­ga­porean lawyer Eu­gene Thu­raisingam had told him that Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam had said he “wields in­flu­ence over the Chief Jus­tice” and “calls the shot and con­trolls (sic) Sun­daresh Menon”.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said that they have ini­ti­ated in­ves­ti­ga­tions into lawyer M. Ravi for an of­fence of crim­i­nal defama­tion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last night, the po­lice said the in­ves­ti­ga­tions were in re­la­tion to a Face­book post by Mr Ravi on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi al­leged in the post that Sin­ga­porean lawyer Eu­gene Thu­raisingam had told him that Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam had said he “wields in­flu­ence over the Chief Jus­tice” and</p>
    <p>“calls the shot and con­trolls (sic) Sun­daresh Menon”.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon is Sin­ga­pore’s Chief Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Mr Thu­raisingam wrote a letter to Mr Shan­mugam, say­ing that “there is ab­so­lutely no truth what­so­ever” to Mr Ravi’s al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Thu­raisingam also posted a copy of the letter on his Face­book page, re­fer­ring to Mr Ravi’s Face­book post as “false and com­pletely un­true”.</p>
    <p>The po­lice added that ac­cord­ing to Mr Thu­raisingam, Mr Ravi had made sim­i­lar al­le­ga­tions in a Face­book post pub­lished on June 12, 2017.</p>
    <p>Mr Thu­raisingam had clar­i­fied with Mr Shan­mugam on June 13, 2017, that Mr Ravi’s al­le­ga­tions were false.</p>
    <p>No po­lice ac­tion had been taken then.</p>
    <p>Those found guilty of crim­i­nal defama­tion can be jailed for up to two years, fined or both.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Mr Ravi was em­broiled in an­other case of un­sup­ported at­tacks against state pros­e­cu­tors and a se­nior district judge.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal de­ter­mined that he should be or­dered to pay a penalty of at least $10,000 for these at­tacks, which were con­tained in a me­dia state­ment pub­lished by Mr Ravi and posted on­line in July last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi was also or­dered to pay $3,000 in costs to the Law So­ci­ety, which pros­e­cuted the case.</p>
