    <p>Just a few months af­ter Ms Carissa Fan was hired as a client re­la­tions ex­ec­u­tive for a cin­ema last Novem­ber, Covid-19 hit.</p>
    <p>Cin­ema book­ings worth six-fig­ure sums were can­celled and even­tu­ally the 227-seater cin­ema at Cap­i­tal Tower had to stop op­er­at­ing due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, said her boss Sher­man Ng, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Salt Me­dia & En­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, the com­pany had al­ready been work­ing on a fam­i­lyfriendly stream­ing ser­vice, SMIX, which it in­tended to launch in the se­cond half of this year.</p>
    <p>Bring­ing for­ward the launch to April opened up a source of rev­enue, said Mr Ng, 41.</p>
    <p>He shifted Ms Fan and an­other em­ployee from the cin­ema team to work on SMIX, rather than lay­ing them off.</p>
    <p>“(Carissa) had barely joined the team but bonds were al­ready formed and we didn’t want to lose her,” said Mr Ng, who had to let the cin­ema’s part-timers go.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing able to re­train her for some­thing else was very help­ful.”</p>
    <p>Ms Fan, 30, signed up for the Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme for Dig­i­tal Sales Ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>She started three months of classes in March and is now do­ing three months of on-the-job train­ing in her firm.</p>
    <p>The for­mer flight stew­ardess, who took a 11/ -year ca­reer break to 2 raise her new­born son, said she had a bit of mar­ket­ing back­ground from school, but was not savvy with cur­rent trends.</p>
    <p>“If not for my course mates, I would have strug­gled, but ev­ery­one helped one an­other out,” she said, adding that she also learnt a lot from in­dus­try men­tors on the course.</p>
    <p>Ms Fan said she has used what she learnt to help plan and brain­storm ideas for the SMIX stream­ing ser­vice and app.</p>
    <p>She also ran cam­paigns with char­i­ta­ble or­gan­i­sa­tions which re­ceived some of the pro­ceeds from pur­chases of shows.</p>
    <p>“With new skills, I’m more con­fi­dent of my abil­ity to con­trib­ute in my cur­rent com­pany and stay em­ploy­able,” she said.</p>
