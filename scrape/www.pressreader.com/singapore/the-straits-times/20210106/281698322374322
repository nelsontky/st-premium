    <p>About 1,000 peo­ple have been asked to re­turn their pay­outs from the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs), af­ter it was found that there were er­ro­neous dec­la­ra­tions in their ap­pli­ca­tions, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber af­fected amounts to about 0.5 per cent of around 200,000 Sirs re­cip­i­ents, with around $1.8 billion paid out to self­em­ployed peo­ple be­tween April and De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>“To be fair and con­sis­tent to all ap­pli­cants, those with er­ro­neous dec­la­ra­tions have been ap­proached to re­fund their Sirs pay­outs. Some have al­ready done so, and we will reach out to the rest in­di­vid­u­ally to give them time to do so,” she said in re­sponse to a question from Work­ers’ Party MP Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC).</p>
    <p>Sirs is a Covid-19 as­sis­tance pro­gramme which pro­vided self-em­ployed peo­ple with three quar­terly cash pay­outs of $3,000 each in May, July and Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that Sirs, as with all other gov­ern­ment schemes, is sub­ject to fi­nan­cial au­dit. An ex­ter­nal au­di­tor ap­pointed by the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC), which is in charge of ad­min­is­ter­ing the scheme, will be con­duct­ing the au­dit.</p>
    <p>The Man­power Min­istry also con­ducted its own au­dit, which is still on­go­ing, be­fore and af­ter the fi­nal pay­out tranche was dis­bursed.</p>
    <p>“For timely as­sis­tance to self-em­ployed in­di­vid­u­als, el­i­gi­bil­ity was as­sessed based on ap­pli­cants’ dec­la­ra­tions of their em­ploy­ment in­come and num­ber of prop­er­ties owned. Those whose dec­la­ra­tions met the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria re­ceived pay­outs,” she said.</p>
    <p>While sub­se­quent au­dits af­firmed the el­i­gi­bil­ity of most suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants, a mi­nor­ity were found with er­ro­neous dec­la­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>WP chief Pri­tam Singh (Alju­nied GRC) asked if there were cases where the MOM or NTUC had ap­proved ap­pli­ca­tions even though the ap­pli­cants fell out­side the qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria, and sub­se­quently clawed back pay­outs upon de­cid­ing later that the ap­pli­ca­tions should not have been ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said she had not come across such cases, though she be­lieves there may have been a few of them. She also said that she did not have fig­ures on this to share.</p>
    <p>She added that the MOM and NTUC are aware that there were scams invit­ing peo­ple who were not the in­tended re­cip­i­ents of Sirs to ap­ply for it. These cases have been re­ferred to the po­lice for in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Sirs was open to those who earned a net trade in­come of up to $100,000 and lived in a prop­erty with an an­nual value of no more than $21,000. Ap­pli­cants could not own more than one prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Those who were rent­ing could sub­mit proof of their an­nual rental con­tract. They were also re­quired to have started self-em­ploy­ment on or be­fore March 25 last year.</p>
