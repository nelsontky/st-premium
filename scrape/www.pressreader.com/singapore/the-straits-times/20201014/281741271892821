    <p>Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) posted its first net loss as it took a hit from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The group re­ported a net loss of $83.7 mil­lion for the year ended Aug 31, re­vers­ing the net profit of $213.2 mil­lion a year ago as Covid-19 se­verely dis­rupted all seg­ments of its busi­ness, it said yesterday.</p>
    <p>The group re­mains op­er­a­tionally prof­itable at $110.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>But losses in non-cash fair value of $232 mil­lion for in­vest­ment prop­er­ties, such as re­tail as­sets and pur­pose-built stu­dent ac­com­mo­da­tion (PBSA), ac­counted for the net loss.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty val­u­a­tion of the re­tail malls was re­duced by $196.5 mil­lion and the PBSA as­sets by $31.9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The main im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic was par­tially cush­ioned by $68.5 mil­lion worth of gov­ern­ment grants, such as through the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, SPH noted.</p>
    <p>Over­all oper­at­ing rev­enue de­clined $93.6 mil­lion, or 9.8 per cent, to $865.7 mil­lion, on the back of a 31.4 per cent de­cline in me­dia ad­ver­tise­ment rev­enue.</p>
    <p>The fall in ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enue led the me­dia busi­ness seg­ment to post a loss be­fore tax­a­tion of $11.4 mil­lion, com­pared with a profit of $54.7 mil­lion for the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year. This loss takes into ac­count re­trench­ment costs of $16.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for the me­dia busi­ness also fell, by 22.8 per cent to $445.1 mil­lion. This was largely due to a de­cline of 32.9 per cent, or $99.1 mil­lion, in news­pa­per print ad­ver­tise­ment rev­enue, as Covid-19 in­ten­si­fied the structural de­cline in the ad­ver­tis­ing sec­tor, SPH said.</p>
    <p>But cir­cu­la­tion rev­enue held steady, sup­ported by a 52.5 per cent in­crease in daily av­er­age news­pa­per dig­i­tal sales, said SPH, which pub­lishes The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Covid-19 im­pact, the prop­erty seg­ment also saw a rise in rev­enue, by 10.3 per cent to $327.2 mil­lion, boosted by the ac­qui­si­tions of West­field Mar­ion mall in Aus­tralia and the Stu­dent Cas­tle ac­com­mo­da­tion port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from the re­tail malls was lifted by West­field Mar­ion but rental waivers of $33.8 mil­lion for ten­ants in Sin­ga­pore eroded the gains.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from the PBSA port­fo­lio grew strongly by 60.6 per cent, or $22.1 mil­lion, ow­ing to the Stu­dent Cas­tle port­fo­lio and a full year’s rev­enue from the ac­qui­si­tions made in the 2019 fi­nan­cial year. SPH now owns 7,723 beds across 18 cities in the United King­dom and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>But with the fair val­u­a­tion loss on in­vest­ment prop­er­ties, the prop­erty seg­ment turned neg­a­tive with a loss be­fore tax­a­tion of $75.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from other chan­nels grew by 8.7 per cent to $93.3 mil­lion, ow­ing to higher sales of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment in the aged care busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The seg­ment also posted a pre-tax profit of $1.9 mil­lion partly due to the di­vest­ment gain on Me­dia Cen­tre of $25.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>SPH chief ex­ec­u­tive Ng Yat Chung said: “All our ma­jor busi­ness seg­ments were se­verely dis­rupted by Covid-19. Our me­dia busi­ness is badly affected by the col­lapse in ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the 9.4 per cent growth in cir­cu­la­tion num­bers from the suc­cess of our news tablet dig­i­tal prod­uct and higher read­er­ship is a bright spot. We are in­ten­si­fy­ing our dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts to trans­form the news con­tent busi­ness in re­sponse to evolv­ing de­mands from our au­di­ence.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We will con­tinue to take a pru­dent and dis­ci­plined ap­proach to liq­uid­ity and cap­i­tal man­age­ment to weather the Covid-19 cri­sis with all our stake­hold­ers.”</p>
    <p>Dis­ci­plined cost man­age­ment saw staff costs eas­ing 1.5 per cent based on a lower head­count and re­duced bonus pro­vi­sion. Costs of newsprint and ma­te­ri­als were trimmed by 11.2 per cent to $119.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>But to­tal costs were 6.8 per cent higher, partly due to the in­creased op­er­a­tional costs of run­ning the ex­panded real es­tate in­vest­ment trust and PBSA port­fo­lio, with prop­erty tax re­bates passed on to ten­ants, as well as re­trench­ment costs.</p>
    <p>SPH di­rec­tors pro­posed a fi­nal div­i­dend of one cent per share. Sub­ject to share­hold­ers’ ap­proval, this div­i­dend is ex­pected to be paid on Dec 18. To­gether with the in­terim div­i­dend of 1.5 cents, the to­tal div­i­dend pay­out for this year will be 2.5 cents.</p>
    <p>All our ma­jor busi­ness seg­ments were se­verely dis­rupted by Covid-19. Our me­dia busi­ness is badly affected by the col­lapse in ad­ver­tis­ing. How­ever, the</p>
    <p>9.4 per cent growth in cir­cu­la­tion num­bers from the suc­cess of our news tablet dig­i­tal prod­uct and higher read­er­ship is a bright spot.</p>
