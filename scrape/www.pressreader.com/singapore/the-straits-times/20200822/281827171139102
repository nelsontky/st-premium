    <p>• New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern yes­ter­day de­ferred a de­ci­sion on whether to ease a lock­down on the city of Auck­land as 11 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions were re­ported, in­clud­ing nine cases of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>New Zealand’s big­gest city was placed un­der lock­down ear­lier this month un­til Aug 26 amid a spike in new Covid-19 cases, forc­ing busi­nesses to close and schools to shut.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said af­ter a re­view of the lock­down that there was no need to change any set­tings at this stage, and promised to re­view them again on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“We have made good progress. Un­like our first lock­down we are not deal­ing with mul­ti­ple out­breaks,” she said.</p>
    <p>“There is noth­ing to sug­gest we need to change our course and cer­tainly noth­ing that sug­gests that we need to es­ca­late our re­sponse.”</p>
    <p>The lat­est cases brought the to­tal number of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in New Zealand to 1,315, in­clud­ing 105 ac­tive cases.</p>
    <p>The coun­try of five mil­lion peo­ple has so far re­ported 22 fa­tal­i­ties from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern also took aim at US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump af­ter he claimed there had been a mas­sive break­out of coro­n­avirus cases in New Zealand, his third such ref­er­ence to the coun­try this week.</p>
    <p>The United States had 16,563 cases per mil­lion peo­ple, while New Zealand had 269 cases per mil­lion peo­ple, Ms Ardern said.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one can see that in New Zealand to­day we are talk­ing about 11 cases, whereas the United States has been deal­ing with over 40,000 cases,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But I’ll also add, it’s not just whether you have cases, it’s how you choose to deal with them as a na­tion and per­son­ally I am in­cred­i­bly proud of the ap­proach that all New Zealan­ders have taken to the bat­tle against Covid-19.”</p>
