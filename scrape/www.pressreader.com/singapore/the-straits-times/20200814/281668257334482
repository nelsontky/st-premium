    <p>MANILA • The Philip­pines will be­gin large-scale hu­man test­ing of Rus­sia’s Covid-19 vac­cine in Oc­to­ber, but Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte will not re­ceive the in­oc­u­la­tion un­til reg­u­la­tors guar­an­tee its safety, his spokesman said yesterday.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte had ear­lier of­fered him­self up as a guinea pig for the very first jab, ex­press­ing “huge trust” in the coro­n­avirus vac­cine, de­spite grow­ing scep­ti­cism about its ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>But his spokesman Harry Roque said the Pres­i­dent was sched­uled to re­ceive the vac­cine no ear­lier than May 1 next year – weeks after the Rus­sian-funded phase three clin­i­cal trial in the ar­chi­pel­ago is due to end in March.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion is ex­pected to ap­prove the vac­cine – de­vel­oped by the Ga­ma­leya re­search in­sti­tute and the Rus­sian Defence Min­istry – in April.</p>
    <p>“May 1 is when the PSG (pres­i­den­tial se­cu­rity group) may al­low him, once all req­ui­site tests have been fin­ished,” Mr Roque told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia says it has de­vel­oped the world’s first vac­cine of­fer­ing “sus­tain­able im­mu­nity” against the coro­n­avirus and is in the fi­nal stage of tests in­volv­ing 2,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But its de­ci­sion to grant ap­proval be­fore com­plet­ing tri­als has raised con­cerns among some ex­perts, who fear it may be putting na­tional pres­tige be­fore safety.</p>
    <p>Moscow has brushed aside in­ter­na­tional con­cerns about the vac­cine’s safety and an­nounced it will start mass in­oc­u­la­tion this month be­fore clin­i­cal test­ing is com­pleted.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme will be vol­un­tary.</p>
    <p>Philippine Health Un­der­sec­re­tary Maria Rosario Vergeire said all clin­i­cal tri­als would need to go through the reg­u­la­tory process.</p>
    <p>Mr Roque said Philippine ex­perts will re­view next month the re­sults of</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s phase one and phase two clin­i­cal tri­als be­fore the South-east Asian coun­try starts its phase three test­ing.</p>
    <p>The phase three clin­i­cal tri­als in the Philip­pines are due to run from Oc­to­ber to March next year, after a panel of vac­cine ex­perts com­pletes its re­view on Rus­sia’s phase one and two tri­als next month, Mr Roque said. “We will do it si­mul­ta­ne­ously with Rus­sia,” he said.</p>
    <p>Philippine of­fi­cials from the science and tech­nol­ogy depart­ment met with Ga­ma­leya on Wed­nes­day to dis­cuss the pro­to­cols for the trial of the vac­cine, which is dubbed “Sput­nik V” after the pi­o­neer­ing Soviet satel­lite of the 1950s.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines, which is strug­gling to con­tain the virus, has ac­cepted Rus­sia’s of­fer to par­tic­i­pate in pro­duc­tion of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Dr Anna Lisa Ong-Lim, an in­fec­tious disease pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of the Philip­pines Col­lege of</p>
    <p>Medicine, said the gov­ern­ment’s time­line to have a vac­cine avail­able by May was “very op­ti­mistic”.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is also set to start clin­i­cal tri­als next Mon­day for the Ja­panese an­tivi­ral drug Avi­gan to treat coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines has logged the highest num­ber of con­firmed in­fec­tions in South-east Asia with more than 147,000 cases and over 2,400 deaths. It re­ported an­other 4,002 new in­fec­tions and 23 ad­di­tional deaths in the coun­try yesterday.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte is keen to ac­cess a vac­cine and last month made a plea to China to make the Philip­pines a pri­or­ity if it de­vel­ops one.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent has pledged that the Philip­pines, which suf­fered its big­gest eco­nomic con­trac­tion in nearly three decades, would be “back to nor­mal” by De­cem­ber even as it has been re­port­ing record num­bers of daily coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions since last month.</p>
