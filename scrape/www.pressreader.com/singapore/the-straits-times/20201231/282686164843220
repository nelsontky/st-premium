    <p>PG13, 133 min­utes, opens to­day</p>
    <p>Be­cause it was sup­posed to be re­leased in Jan­uary this year, this was al­ways go­ing to be a 10-course Chi­nese New Year gut-buster of a meal. Still, noth­ing will pre­pare you for just how much has been jammed into this two-hour-plus record of the lives of he­li­borne he­roes.</p>
    <p>Hit-mak­ing Hong Kong di­rec­tor Dante Lam (the ac­tion thrillers Op­er­a­tion Mekong, 2016; Op­er­a­tion Red Sea, 2018) builds the story around Ed­die Peng’s cap­tain Gao Qian, a char­ac­ter who suf­fers from a tragic case of Dis­as­ter Movie Syn­drome, an af­flic­tion that makes the hero strong in one scene then weak in an­other, or be a mav­er­ick in one situation yet snap into team player mode should the need arise.</p>
    <p>He leads a team at China Res­cue and Sal­vage, the govern­ment agency charged with en­sur­ing the safety of those around the na­tion’s coast. The sin­gle dad looks after Cong Cong (Zhang Jingyi), a child of un­sur­passed adora­bil­ity. When he and his team are not pluck­ing work­ers from burn­ing oil rigs or lift­ing sailors from sink­ing tankers, the res­cue bros hold clean-cut beach par­ties and com­fort wor­ried girl­friends.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­est­ing wrin­kle de­vel­ops when new pi­lot Fang (Xin Zhilei) en­ters the pic­ture. She and Gao are at log­ger­heads im­me­di­ately, but the fric­tion be­tween them has lit­tle to do with gen­der pol­i­tics. Rather, it is about their dif­fer­ing views on what makes a res­cue too risky to at­tempt.</p>
    <p>This be­ing a Chi­nese pro­duc­tion and re­port­edly cre­ated with the help of the Chi­nese Min­istry of Trans­port, the ab­sence of sex­ism in the work­place should not come as a sur­prise. Nor the fact that ev­ery mem­ber of the force, es­pe­cially the se­niors, are per­cep­tive, sen­si­tive and wise be­yond all mea­sure. Cor­rec­tion: Gao has one char­ac­ter-defin­ing flaw. He is too brave, he cares too much for the peo­ple he is try­ing to save.</p>
    <p>It must be said that this is not merely a Chi­nese movie is­sue. It crops up in films from China, Hol­ly­wood or Sin­ga­pore that re­quire the use of sym­bols, ships and air­craft from na­tional agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Those re­stric­tions, how­ever, have a cou­ple of blind spots, such as when the film lurches into a ro­man­tic di­rec­tion. It is a plot de­vel­op­ment that causes crack pi­lot Fang, who for much of the movie ap­pears to have iced wa­ter in her veins, to morph into a stereo­typ­i­cally blub­ber­ing woman un­der the stress of see­ing her beloved in mor­tal dan­ger.</p>
    <p>Along with the ro­mance, fam­ily drama, epic res­cues and bro-bond­ing, di­rec­tor Lam also throws in a dash of soft porn – of the male kind, seen in shots of Peng’s rip­pling rear, along with those of a team­mate’s, in the shower.</p>
    <p>That bit of bur­lesque and the touch of gore, seen in shots of vic­tims of ex­plo­sions and crashes, are a cou­ple of weirdly hu­man and there­fore in­ter­est­ing touches in an oth­er­wise over­long and pre­dictable pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>THE MID­NIGHT SKY</p>
    <p>NC16, 118 min­utes, Net­flix</p>
    <p>Ge­orge Clooney the ac­tor has worked with the best di­rec­tors, from Al­fonso Cuaron (sci­ence-fic­tion thriller Grav­ity, 2013) to the Coen broth­ers (the come­dies Burn After Read­ing, 2008; O Brother Where Art Thou?, 2000).</p>
    <p>He is a di­rec­tor him­self. You might re­mem­ber his sec­ond fea­ture, the biopic of jour­nal­ist Ed­ward R. Mur­row, Good Night, And Good Luck (2005), for which he earned an Os­car nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>His last few tries at di­rect­ing have not pro­duced duds ex­actly, but they have not set the world on fire ei­ther. This Net­flix movie, a sci­ence-fic­tion piece that feels like a dis­tant re­la­tion to Grav­ity, points to a cou­ple of his weak­nesses as a film-maker.</p>
    <p>The story be­gins with a char­ac­ter played by Clooney him­self. It is set in the fu­ture and he is Au­gus­tine, left alone on an Arc­tic sta­tion as ev­ery­one else evac­u­ates un­der­ground to es­cape an un­spec­i­fied ra­dioac­tive event creep­ing across Earth, killing every­thing.</p>
    <p>He uses the sta­tion’s equip­ment to send a warn­ing to the space­ship Aether, which is on its way home after a long trip to Jupiter. The crew, which in­cludes Dr Sul­li­van (Felic­ity Jones), Ade­wole (David Oyelowo) and Sanchez (Demian Bichir), are un­aware of Earth’s im­pend­ing doom. Au­gus­tine’s iso­la­tion is shat­tered, how­ever, when he dis­cov­ers Iris (Caoilinn Springall), a girl left be­hind by the evac­uees by mis­take.</p>
    <p>What de­vel­ops from this work, adapted from the 2016 novel Good Morn­ing, Mid­night by Lily Brooks-Dal­ton, might be called “emo sci­ence fic­tion”. The plot does not hinge on tech­nol­ogy get­ting char­ac­ters into and out of trou­ble; rather, the story con­cerns it­self with mat­ters of re­gret, grief, hope and love.</p>
    <p>The set­ting is grand, but there is too much jar­ring Arc­tic sur­vival and space ad­ven­ture filler. The space seg­ments bring to mind Ad As­tra (2019) and, yes, Grav­ity. And like Ad As­tra, which stars Brad Pitt, Clooney’s movie feels like a ses­sion of med­i­ta­tive reverie in­ter­rupted by scenes of fran­tic as­tro­naut ac­tion. Some di­rec­tors know how to make ad­ven­ture movies that seam­lessly blend ac­tion with feel­ings of loss and heart­break – Clooney is not one of them.</p>
    <p>I RE­MEM­BER</p>
    <p>(PG, 100 min­utes, opens to­day, not re­viewed)</p>
    <p>An­ge­lababy and Lee Hongchi star in this Man­darin ro­mance seen from the point of view of Fei Li (Lee), a shy com­puter tech­ni­cian se­cretly in love with Zhao (An­ge­lababy), a col­league. Both are on a com­pany trip to Fin­land when Zhao has an ac­ci­dent which erases her mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Now that she is a clean slate and has for­got­ten that she has a boyfriend back home, Li seizes the chance to make her fall in love with him be­fore her mem­o­ries re­turn.</p>
