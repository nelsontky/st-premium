    <p>The Court of Three Judges, the high­est dis­ci­plinary body in the le­gal pro­fes­sion, on Fri­day urged lawyers to steer clear of en­ter­ing into busi­ness trans­ac­tions with their clients as this will of­ten lead to a con­flict of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The re­marks were made in the court’s de­tailed grounds for its de­ci­sion last month to dis­bar Mr Mal­colm Tan Chun Chuen, a lawyer of 20 years’ stand­ing who also pro­vided in­vest­ment ser­vices, for three charges in­volv­ing dis­hon­esty.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, in per­suad­ing a client to in­vest money with him, had falsely claimed that profits of 12 per cent per an­num would be “guar­an­teed” by the pro­fes­sional indemnity in­sur­ance that he held as a prac­tis­ing lawyer.</p>
    <p>The client even­tu­ally put $150,000 into this “guar­an­teed re­turns” in­vest­ment scheme and an­other $100,000 into a “non-guar­an­teed” scheme.</p>
    <p>“As a gen­eral rule, it is in­ad­vis­able for so­lic­i­tors to en­ter into busi­ness trans­ac­tions with their clients since this will of­ten have a real po­ten­tial to give rise to a con­flict of in­ter­est,” said the judg­ment, writ­ten by Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon.</p>
    <p>“A so­lic­i­tor who in­vites a prospec­tive client to con­sum­mate a so­lic­i­tor-client re­la­tion­ship with him in or­der to then deal with that client as a prin­ci­pal in a sep­a­rate busi­ness trans­ac­tion is court­ing pro­fes­sional dis­as­ter.”</p>
    <p>The court said that Mr Tan’s con­duct was par­tic­u­larly “dis­grace­ful and ap­palling” be­cause he had used his pro­fes­sional sta­tus to give the client false as­sur­ance that the client’s in­ter­ests would be safe­guarded.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Mr Tan, who was then prac­tis­ing at Key­stone Law Cor­po­ra­tion, met Mr Kuek Yak Yeon and pro­moted var­i­ous in­vest­ment prod­ucts to him.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuek signed two let­ters of en­gage­ment un­der Key­stone’s let­ter­head, stat­ing that the law firm would over­see his in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>He then is­sued a cheque for $250,000 to Bluesky, a busi­ness con­sul­tancy firm owned by Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuek said Mr Tan had as­sured him that his money would be pro­tected and that is­su­ing the cheque to Bluesky was “the same” as pay­ing Key­stone.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuek filed a com­plaint to the Law So­ci­ety af­ter he asked Key­stone for an up­date on the money and was told by the law firm that it had not re­ceived any funds from him or done any le­gal work for him.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan ar­gued that Mr Kuek hired him not as a lawyer but as a busi­ness ad­viser.</p>
    <p>This con­tention was re­jected by a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal, which re­ferred him to the court to mete out pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>The court said a strik­ing off was war­ranted, as this was a case in which Mr Tan acted dis­hon­estly in favour­ing his own in­ter­ests over those of Mr Kuek.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan had used his stand­ing as a lawyer to make false rep­re­sen­ta­tions to Mr Kuek and con­structed an elab­o­rate hoax us­ing the let­ters to con­vince Mr Kuek that the law firm would su­per­vise his in­vest­ments, said the court.</p>
    <p>The court also said it will re­fer the case to the Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor to con­sider whether any crim­i­nal charges should be brought against Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the At­tor­neyGen­eral’s Cham­bers said it will be look­ing into the mat­ter.</p>
