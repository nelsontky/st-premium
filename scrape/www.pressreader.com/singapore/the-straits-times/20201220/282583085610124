    <p>Fi­nan­cial an­a­lyst Ter­ence Cheng was con­sid­er­ing his next steps two years into his first job in an ac­count­ing firm.</p>
    <p>So, he did what any mil­len­nial would do – look on­line.</p>
    <p>He found a wealth of ad­vice and anec­dotes on plat­forms such as LinkedIn, In­sta­gram and fo­rums like Red­dit and Hard­wareZone, as well as we­bi­nars by in­dus­try and pro­fes­sional as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“There’s a wide range of per­spec­tives and ad­vice avail­able on­line. I could tap the wis­dom of the crowd and sup­ple­ment it with ex­perts’ ad­vice to see what was most ap­pli­ca­ble to my sit­u­a­tion and de­cide on my next steps ac­cord­ingly,” said Mr Cheng, 30.</p>
    <p>One tip he picked up was to place more em­pha­sis on “choos­ing” a good boss to work for, es­pe­cially in the first few years of work which form the foun­da­tion of his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>It helped him de­cide to take up a job of­fer which, he said, led him to where he is to­day.</p>
    <p>Ca­reer coach­ing is tak­ing on a new form in the age of social media, driven by hunger for on­the-go in­for­ma­tion and en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>And as new for­mats such as TikTok videos and pod­casts gain pop­u­lar­ity, con­tent cre­ators rang­ing from pro­fes­sional ca­reer coaches to well-mean­ing in­di­vid­u­als have been jump­ing on the band­wagon to of­fer free ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Some dance and lip-sync to catchy mu­sic while dis­play­ing cap­tions on how to ask for a pro­mo­tion, while oth­ers get suc­cess­ful en­trepreneur­s to share pearls of wis­dom with the young crowd.</p>
    <p>“We see the uses of social media evolve from be­ing some­thing al­most purely for social and en­ter­tain­ment pur­poses to se­ri­ous ve­hi­cles for the com­mu­ni­ca­tion of all types of in­for­ma­tion,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Trevor Yu of Nanyang Business School who is co-di­rec­tor for Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Cen­tre for Re­search and De­vel­op­ment i n Learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Social Sci­ences (SUSS) se­nior lec­turer for mar­ket­ing Vanessa Liu said the bite-size videos shared on en­ter­tain­ment app TikTok meet the short at­ten­tion span and pref­er­ences of mil­len­ni­als for vis­ual and video con­tent.</p>
    <p>The app has made video edit­ing so user-friendly that novices can also get on board.</p>
    <p>New media, like pod­casts, are likely to be­come more pop­u­lar among mil­len­ni­als, added Dr Liu.</p>
    <p>“The ad­ver­tise­ments in pod­casts are min­imised and the pod­casts could be avail­able on de­mand. Th­ese fea­tures meet the grow­ing needs of mil­len­ni­als for use­ful knowl­edge, cred­i­ble in­for­ma­tion or en­ter­tain­ing top­ics in­stantly avail­able.”</p>
    <p>TikTok was down­loaded some 3.2 mil­lion times be­tween 2018 to Dec 14 this year, ac­cord­ing to es­ti­mates by an­a­lyt­ics firm Sen­sor Tower of first-time unique in­stalls from Sin­ga­pore’s App Store and Google Play.</p>
    <p>A Spo­tify sur­vey in May of 500 Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents aged 18 to 37 found that 22 per cent of them lis­ten to pod­casts at least once a week.</p>
    <p>TikTok’s user and con­tent op­er­a­tions man­ager for Sin­ga­pore, Ms Doreen Tan, said the plat­form saw a 63 per cent jump in the cre­ation of ed­u­ca­tional videos among users here be­tween July and Septem­ber this year.</p>
    <p>The firm has been en­cour­ag­ing more in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions to cre­ate con­tent that pro­motes learn­ing new skills, habits or in­for­ma­tion, she added.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say th­ese new for­mats make ca­reer ad­vice more ac­ces­si­ble, di­gestible and mem­o­rable for mil­len­ni­als.</p>
    <p>Dr Bran­don Koh, an in­dus­trial-or­gan­i­sa­tional psy­chol­o­gist and lec­turer at SUSS, said young peo­ple may learn more ef­fec­tively from a per­son they can re­late to, such as an­other mil­len­nial seek­ing their first job or re­lat­ing ad­vice they have learnt and used suc­cess­fully.</p>
    <p>“Ca­reer ad­vice also prompts in­di­vid­u­als about the va­ri­ety of fac­tors to con­sider, which could il­lu­mi­nate blind spots or pro­vide bal­anced per­spec­tives,” he said.</p>
    <p>As new for­mats such as TikTok videos and pod­casts gain pop­u­lar­ity, con­tent cre­ators rang­ing from pro­fes­sional ca­reer coaches to well-mean­ing in­di­vid­u­als have been jump­ing on the band­wagon to of­fer free ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Still, Prof Yu rec­om­mends tak­ing user-gen­er­ated ca­reer ad­vice with a pinch of salt.</p>
    <p>“Risks to con­sumers can range from sim­ply be­liev­ing in in­ap­pli­ca­ble or un­proven ad­vice to even more se­ri­ous con­se­quences like be­ing ma­nip­u­lated to hold be­liefs which are down­right wrong and harm­ful to the man­age­ment of one’s ca­reer. The bot­tom line is, try to make sure the in­for­ma­tion is com­ing from a source with an es­tab­lished pro­fes­sional record,” said Prof Yu.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh said peo­ple giv­ing ad­vice are on aver­age more likely to rec­om­mend ide­al­is­tic choices to oth­ers, per­haps fo­cus­ing on ide­al­is­tic char­ac­ter­is­tics of jobs like an em­ployer’s brand­ing or sym­bolic sta­tus of par­tic­u­lar jobs.</p>
    <p>But the peo­ple mak­ing the de­ci­sion who have to ex­pe­ri­ence and ex­e­cute their own choices may need to take a more prag­matic ap­proach and look at prac­ti­cal con­sid­er­a­tions such as job se­cu­rity, the ac­tual job tasks and po­ten­tial stres­sors.</p>
    <p>PER­SON­ALISED COACH­ING STILL IN DE­MAND</p>
    <p>Be­sides con­sum­ing on­line con­tent, young peo­ple seem to be more ea­ger for one-to-one ca­reer coach­ing too, with a 40 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of job seek­ers aged 35 and be­low seek­ing help be­tween Jan­uary and Oc­to­ber, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>This is based on the num­ber of them who reg­is­tered for em­ploy­ment as­sis­tance at Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) Ca­reers Con­nect and the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) cen­tres.</p>
    <p>A WSG spokesman said the in­crease is likely to be due to more job seek­ers, in­clud­ing younger ones, be­ing af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic this year, as well as greater ef­fort by WSG and e2i to engage with and help more job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Com­mon is­sues young peo­ple seek help for in­clude clar­ity on ca­reer di­rec­tion and per­sonal val­ues as well as job search tech­niques, ac­cord­ing to ca­reer coaches.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of e2i, Mr Gil­bert Tan, said they also look for opin­ions on whether or not they should make a ca­reer switch when dis­sat­is­fied with their cur­rent job, or whether they should fur­ther their education, for in­stance, through a mas­ter’s de­gree, to im­prove job prospects.</p>
    <p>Some want help as they are hav­ing trou­ble land­ing a job, which could some­times be due to mind­set is­sues such as not be­ing will­ing to take on lower start­ing pay or be­ing fix­ated on hav­ing a job that is di­rectly rel­e­vant to their field of stud­ies, he said.</p>
    <p>De­spite the con­ve­nience of ac­cess­ing ca­reer ad­vice on­line, per­son­alised coach­ing may still be more ef­fec­tive for some peo­ple.</p>
    <p>This was the ex­pe­ri­ence of Mr Farhan Ju­raimi, 29, who sought ca­reer coach­ing at e2i in March af­ter search­ing un­suc­cess­fully for a job in events, the field he had been work­ing in un­til his con­tract was not re­newed.</p>
    <p>His coach ad­vised him to con­tinue learn­ing tech­ni­cal skills dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and post his cer­tifi­cates and achieve­ments on LinkedIn, so he took cour­ses in data sci­ence as he has a back­ground in in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>This paved the way for him to find his cur­rent job as a sys­tems en­gi­neer in a multi­na­tional com­pany. A for­mer polytech­nic friend he re­con­nected with on LinkedIn saw his data sci­ence cer­tifi­cates and rec­om­mended him for a job open­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Farhan, who grad­u­ated from univer­sity last year, said he used to think ca­reer coach­ing was a waste of time but has since changed his mind.</p>
    <p>“Some may think it’s for older peo­ple, but some­times, get­ting per­son­alised ad­vice can be bet­ter than some­thing generic,” he said.</p>
    <p>Com­mon is­sues young peo­ple seek help for in­clude clar­ity on ca­reer di­rec­tion and per­sonal val­ues as well as job search tech­niques, ac­cord­ing to ca­reer coaches.</p>
