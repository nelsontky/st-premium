    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US fed­eral em­ploy­ees would be barred from us­ing Chi­nese-owned mo­bile video app TikTok on gov­ern­ment-is­sued de­vices un­der a Bill that passed a US Sen­ate Com­mit­tee on Wed­nes­day, as law­mak­ers had fears about the se­cu­rity of users’ per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>The “No TikTok on Gov­ern­ment De­vices Act” from Se­na­tor Josh Haw­ley was passed unan­i­mously by the United States Sen­ate Com­mit­tee on Home­land Se­cu­rity and Govern­men­tal Af­fairs, and will be taken up by the US Sen­ate for a vote.</p>
    <p>TikTok’s wide pop­u­lar­ity among Amer­i­can teens has brought scru­tiny from US reg­u­la­tors and law­mak­ers, who fear their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion could fall into the hands of gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>TikTok, used to cre­ate short dance, lip sync, com­edy and tal­ent videos, said last year about 60 per cent of its 26.5 mil­lion monthly ac­tive US users are aged 16 to 24.</p>
    <p>Un­der a Chi­nese law in­tro­duced in 2017, firms are obliged to sup­port and co­op­er­ate in the coun­try’s na­tional in­tel­li­gence work.</p>
    <p>The House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives this week voted to bar fed­eral em­ploy­ees from down­load­ing the app on gov­ern­ment-is­sued de­vices as part of a US$741 bil­lion (S$1 tril­lion) de­fence pol­icy Bill. Law­mak­ers voted 336-71 to pass the pro­posal.</p>
    <p>With pas­sage in the House and ap­proval by the Sen­ate Com­mit­tee, the pro­hi­bi­tion could soon be­come law in the US.</p>
    <p>Top of­fi­cials in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion have said they were con­sid­er­ing a broader ban on TikTok and other Chi­nese-linked apps, and that ac­tion may be im­mi­nent.</p>
    <p>TikTok spokesman Jamie Favazza said the com­pany’s grow­ing US team has no higher pri­or­ity than pro­mot­ing a safe app ex­pe­ri­ence that pro­tects users’ pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>“Mil­lions of Amer­i­can fam­i­lies use TikTok for en­ter­tain­ment and cre­ative ex­pres­sion, which we recog­nise is not what fed­eral gov­ern­ment de­vices are for,” she said.</p>
