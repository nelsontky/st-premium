    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s com­pe­ti­tion watch­dog has ceased in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the on­line food de­liv­ery and vir­tual kitchen sec­tors, a move prompted by a shared kitchen op­er­a­tor’s com­plaint in July last year that it had been shut out by De­liv­eroo and GrabFood.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS) started its probe, both food de­liv­ery op­er­a­tors opened up their ser­vices to eater­ies us­ing the fa­cil­i­ties of Smart City Kitchens.</p>
    <p>De­liv­eroo said yes­ter­day it be­gan do­ing so more than three months ago, while GrabFood said it had be­gun do­ing so in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the com­mis­sion said that al­though the in­ves­ti­ga­tion has ceased, it will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the conduct of mar­ket play­ers in the on­line food de­liv­ery and vir­tual kitchen sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Vir­tual kitchens, also called ghost or cloud kitchens, are shared com­mer­cial kitchen spa­ces pro­vided to food and bev­er­age (F&B) op­er­a­tors for food prepa­ra­tion, pre­dom­i­nantly for on­line food de­liv­ery ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In July last year, Smart City Kitchens ap­pealed to CCCS to “help level the play­ing field” af­ter be­ing shut out by the two food de­liv­ery op­er­a­tors just weeks af­ter start­ing its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Smart City Kitchens opened its first fa­cil­ity in Tampines in June last year. It houses 30 in­di­vid­ual kitchens that are rented out to F&B op­er­a­tors for food de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>As it is not af­fil­i­ated with a de­liv­ery ser­vice, its ten­ants have to rely on the main on­line food de­liv­ery ser­vice providers: GrabFood, De­liv­eroo and Food­panda.</p>
    <p>A month af­ter the fa­cil­ity opened, its ten­ants told The Straits Times that De­liv­eroo and GrabFood, which had ini­tially agreed to list them on their re­spec­tive apps, had changed their minds. The duo cited the ten­ants’ land­lord as the rea­son.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to pro­vid­ing de­liv­ery ser­vices, De­liv­eroo op­er­ates three shared kitchens of its own, while GrabFood launched a kitchen space in Jan­uary, and Food­panda has one kitchen.</p>
    <p>BET­TER UN­DER­STAND­ING</p>
    <p>We have had con­struc­tive dis­cus­sions with Smart City Kitchens and now have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of its model and ob­jec­tives and this has, in turn, led us to re­visit our po­si­tion on work­ing with them.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>A DE­LIV­EROO SPOKESMAN, ex­plain­ing its de­ci­sion to work with Smart City’s eater­ies.</p>
    <p>CCCS said its in­ves­ti­ga­tion, which be­gan on Sept 30 last year, in­cluded the re­fusal of food de­liv­ery providers to sup­ply on­line de­liv­ery ser­vices to op­er­a­tors us­ing Smart City’s vir­tual kitchens.</p>
    <p>It added that fol­low­ing its in­ves­ti­ga­tion, GrabFood and De­liv­eroo started supplying their on­line food de­liv­ery ser­vices to op­er­a­tors in Smart City’s fa­cil­i­ties, thus giv­ing the ten­ants “the choice of us­ing mul­ti­ple on­line food de­liv­ery providers to ex­pand their con­sumer reach”.</p>
    <p>A De­liv­eroo spokesman, in ex­plain­ing its de­ci­sion to work with Smart City’s res­tau­rants, said yes­ter­day: “We have had con­struc­tive dis­cus­sions with Smart City Kitchens and now have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of its model and ob­jec­tives and this has, in turn, led us to re­visit our po­si­tion on work­ing with them,” he said.</p>
    <p>GrabFood Sin­ga­pore head Dilip Rousse­naly said in Jan­uary that al­though the com­pany was con­tribut­ing to the in­ves­ti­ga­tion process, it was not the sub­ject of the probe. He also said then that GrabFood had be­gun work­ing with some of Smart City’s ten­ants.</p>
    <p>CCCS added that be­fore the probe, the op­er­a­tors had ac­cess to Food­panda’s ser­vices. It also noted that com­pe­ti­tion in the vir­tual kitchen sec­tor re­mains dy­namic, with play­ers en­ter­ing and com­pet­ing for mar­ket share.</p>
    <p>Smart City Kitchens, whose web­site shows it op­er­ates five vir­tual kitchens in Sin­ga­pore, did not re­spond by press time.</p>
