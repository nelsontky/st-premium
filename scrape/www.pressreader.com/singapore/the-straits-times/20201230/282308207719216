    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The Los An­ge­les Lak­ers com­pleted their open­ing four-game home­stead on Mon­day hop­ing to better as­sim­i­late their off-sea­son ac­qui­si­tions into their roles within the team.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) cham­pi­ons now have four suc­ces­sive road games, start­ing with the San An­to­nio Spurs to­day, after go­ing 2-2 at the Sta­ples Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Damian Lil­lard scored 31 points and Gary Trent Jr had 28, lead­ing the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers to a 115-107 vic­tory over the Lak­ers, who were paced by 29 points from</p>
    <p>NBA Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player LeBron James.</p>
    <p>Team­mate Den­nis Schroder, ac­quired from Ok­la­homa City Thun­der last month, again had a strong show­ing with 24 points.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man guard is av­er­ag­ing 16.8 points per game but fel­low new faces Mon­trezl Har­rell, Marc Ga­sol and Wes­ley Matthews all strug­gled against the Blaz­ers, scor­ing nine, four and two points re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing scorer An­thony Davis, who re­turned from a one-game ab­sence due to a calf in­jury, fin­ished with 13 points and 10 re­bounds, but it was a ten­ta­tive per­for­mance from the All-Star, who was feel­ing his way back.</p>
    <p>After the Lak­ers saw the end of their streak of 59 straight vic­to­ries when tak­ing a lead into the fourth quar­ter (85-84), coach Frank Vo­gel will work on build­ing team chem­istry, with their bench con­tribut­ing just 23 points over­all.</p>
    <p>“We just weren’t mov­ing the ball that well,” he said. “I’ve got to make sure I get (Davis) the ball in op­por­tu­ni­ties where he can be ag­gres­sive.</p>
    <p>“We were kind of stuck in mud a lit­tle bit. I don’t know (why). We just had trou­ble sus­tain­ing that in­ten­sity.”</p>
    <p>This was the first meet­ing be­tween the teams since Los An­ge­les claimed a 4-1 se­ries win in the open­ing round of the play-offs in Au­gust and the Blaz­ers feel they have im­proved since.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, we can build on it,” Port­land coach Terry Stotts said. “We re­alise that we can be a good team. We just beat the de­fend­ing champs, and they’re a great team.”</p>
    <p>All-Star Lil­lard agreed, say­ing: “It makes us just a lit­tle bit more con­fi­dent to be com­ing on the road and con­tin­u­ing to grow, con­tin­u­ing to build on our ef­fort.</p>
    <p>“We’re just get­ting more com­fort­able with each other, and we’re bring­ing our en­ergy.”</p>
    <p>On Trent Jr, who is en­ter­ing his sec­ond year in the league and equalled his ca­reer high of seven three-point­ers, the guard said: “I would as­sume any young player who was com­ing off the kind of sea­son he had last sea­son would ex­pect to be in the ro­ta­tion for more than six min­utes.</p>
    <p>“When that hap­pened, I was like, ‘Let’s see how he re­sponds’. I think it says a lot about him that he came out and had this type of per­for­mance. It speaks to how tough he is men­tally and how locked in he is to this sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Port­land played with­out Nas­sir Lit­tle and Carmelo An­thony, who did not make the trip be­cause of the league’s health and safety pro­to­cols re­lat­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Lak­ers re­serve guard Alex Caruso also missed the con­test for the same rea­son. All play­ers are re­quired to un­dergo daily coro­n­avirus test­ing this sea­son.</p>
    <p>We were kind of stuck in mud a lit­tle bit. I don’t know (why).</p>
    <p>FRANK VO­GEL, LA Lak­ers coach, after the 115-107 home loss to the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers.</p>
