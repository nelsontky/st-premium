    <p>The process of ap­ply­ing for re­lief for self-em­ployed peo­ple who have lost their in­comes dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic should be made less oner­ous, MPs sug­gested in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>First-time MP Der­rick Goh (Nee Soon GRC) said in his maiden speech that he had re­ceived much feed­back from res­i­dents who were not able to ac­cess the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs) for var­i­ous rea­sons.</p>
    <p>He cited three groups of peo­ple who were up­set and felt the scheme was un­fair in some way.</p>
    <p>First, there were those whose ap­pli­ca­tions were re­jected but who did not know why. Mr Goh said some un­suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants re­ceived a re­jec­tion let­ter that did not state a rea­son, and the an­swers on the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) web­site were not clear or spe­cific enough to their sit­u­a­tion. The NTUC is re­spon­si­ble for pro­cess­ing Sirs claims. “Many were dis­ap­pointed and de­scribed NTUC’s re­sponse as cold and not help­ful,” Mr Goh said.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, there were those who knew the rea­son for their re­jec­tion but could not come to terms with it, or did not fully com­pre­hend the ba­sis for the re­jec­tion. Mr Goh said these in­cluded some who lived in prop­er­ties with an an­nual value of more than $21,000, which dis­qual­i­fied them from the scheme.</p>
    <p>Third, there were ap­pli­cants who did not know why they did not qual­ify for Sirs and did not un­der­stand the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria. Mr Goh said they in­cluded hawk­ers and free­lancers who had not been declar­ing their net trade in­come.</p>
    <p>“What­ever their rea­sons for not do­ing so, they are hard hit in this pan­demic,” he said. “Per­haps, in­stead of an out­right re­jec­tion, they could be brought back into the fold and set on the right path, by nudg­ing them to start tax fil­ings and adopt­ing e-pay­ments... to qual­ify for some por­tion of Sirs as­sis­tance.”</p>
    <p>Mr Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) of the Work­ers’ Party noted that many MPs “would have been in­un­dated by ap­peals from Sin­ga­pore­ans whose Sirs ap­pli­ca­tions have been turned down”.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that cer­tain re­quire­ments for aid, such as in­ter­view­ing the rel­a­tives of an ap­pli­cant to de­ter­mine if the ap­pli­cant is re­ceiv­ing fam­ily sup­port, could be re­placed by a sim­ple dec­la­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­views can be em­bar­rass­ing for the ap­pli­cant and also take up the time and re­sources of so­cial work­ers and pub­lic ser­vants, he added.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Mr Per­era, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said she ac­cepted his points on mak­ing im­prove­ments to the ap­pli­ca­tion process. But she also de­fended the NTUC, say­ing it was not easy to reach self-em­ployed in­di­vid­u­als who are “by their very na­ture” not cap­tured in govern­ment sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The NTUC stepped up to take in ap­peals “un­der very, very dif­fi­cult con­straints” just as Sin­ga­pore was en­ter­ing the cir­cuit breaker, she said. “It was very dif­fi­cult to get peo­ple to come on board and set up the sys­tem, get it prop­erly tested and en­sure that it was able to re­spond to the vol­ume of ap­peals.</p>
    <p>“But NTUC, to its credit, ac­cepted that if there were ap­peals, it must mean that there is a need, there­fore they sol­diered on and put on more man­power, which they didn’t re­ally have the bud­get for.”</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, some 180,000 peo­ple were able to get their Sirs pay­outs, Mrs Teo said.</p>
    <p>Mr Per­era asked why the NTUC, in­stead of a min­istry or statu­tory board, was tasked with ad­min­is­ter­ing Sirs when it did not have enough re­sources.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo replied that it is not un­usual for the Govern­ment to part­ner or­gan­i­sa­tions like the NTUC. She noted that the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion is help­ing to ad­min­is­ter the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme, and other or­gan­i­sa­tions have also helped with pre­vi­ous schemes.</p>
    <p>“When the op­por­tu­nity presents it­self, other or­gan­i­sa­tions, be­sides the Govern­ment, want to de­liver help to Sin­ga­pore­ans. We don’t stop them. In fact, we wel­come it.”</p>
