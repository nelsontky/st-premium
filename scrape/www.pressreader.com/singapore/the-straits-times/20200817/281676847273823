    <p>When for­mer busi­ness an­a­lyst Sriv­id­hya Gana­p­a­thy Sun­daram, 29, was re­trenched in May, she felt dis­cour­aged.</p>
    <p>But after tak­ing a few weeks to set­tle her emo­tions, the In­dian na­tional who moved to Sin­ga­pore four years ago de­cided to take a pos­i­tive ap­proach to the sit­u­a­tion and saw it as a chance to pick up new skills.</p>
    <p>In the past three months, in be­tween send­ing out job ap­pli­ca­tions and net­work­ing with con­tacts, she has started learn­ing Ger­man and San­skrit, and spent time paint­ing.</p>
    <p>“I can­not sit idle at home, so I try to make sure I never have a dull day,” said Ms Gana­p­a­thy Sun­daram, who is on an Em­ploy­ment Pass. Her hus­band is work­ing as a me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer on an S-pass. They do not have chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She had been work­ing at a global soft­ware com­pany for al­most two years when the re­trench­ment no­tice hit like “a bolt from the blue”, she said. “I was com­pletely shocked, be­cause I didn’t think I was do­ing badly at work... They sim­ply said that my po­si­tion was be­ing made re­dun­dant,” she said.</p>
    <p>After the re­trench­ment, one of the first things she did was to get in touch with var­i­ous con­tacts she had made over the years to let them know about her job search.</p>
    <p>There has been at least one job of­fer which is in the works.</p>
    <p>But be­ing a for­eigner has also made the job search more dif­fi­cult she said, as one of the first few questions po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers ask is whether she is a Sin­ga­porean or a per­ma­nent res­i­dent. “I do feel dis­cour­aged be­cause al­though I am not a lo­cal, I have worked hard. It does feel like I had to start over again, and that I am back to square one in terms of my ca­reer,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing these try­ing times, when re­trench­ments are be­com­ing more com­mon, the re­al­ity is that ex­pa­tri­ates like her might find it harder to se­cure jobs, said Ms Gana­p­a­thy Sun­daram, who used to draw a salary of about $4,000 monthly. Still, she ac­knowl­edges that it makes sense that any coun­try will give pri­or­ity to its lo­cals in terms of jobs and poli­cies.</p>
    <p>While re­sponses to job ap­pli­ca­tions have been slow, she is con­fi­dent that it will get bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“I think the im­por­tant thing is not to let my mind idle,” she said.</p>
