    <p>WASHINGTON • US Democrats have stepped up pres­sure against a cost-cut­ting cam­paign by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ap­pointed Postal Ser­vice chief that they fear will hold up mail-in bal­lots in Novem­ber’s elec­tion, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi call­ing law­mak­ers back and sev­eral states considerin­g le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Top Democrats i n Congress called on Post­mas­ter Gen­eral Louis DeJoy and an­other top postal official to tes­tify this month at a hear­ing on a wave of cuts that has slowed mail delivery across the coun­try, alarm­ing law­mak­ers ahead of the Nov 3 elec­tion when up to half of vot­ers in the United States could cast bal­lots by mail.</p>
    <p>Democrats have ac­cused Mr Trump, who is trail­ing pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den in opin­ion polls, of try­ing to ham­string the cash-strapped Postal Ser­vice to sup­press mail-in vot­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­peat­edly and with­out ev­i­dence said that a surge in mail-in vot­ing would lead to fraud. Vot­ing by mail is noth­ing new in the US, as one in four vot­ers cast bal­lots that way in 2016.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Demo­cratic state at­tor­neys-gen­eral told Reuters on Sun­day they were in dis­cus­sions about po­ten­tial le­gal ac­tion to stop Postal Ser­vice changes that could af­fect the elec­tion out­come.</p>
    <p>“It is out­ra­geous that Don­ald Trump would at­tempt to un­der­mine the US Postal Ser­vice for elec­toral gain,” Mas­sachusetts At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Maura Healey told Reuters in a tele­phone in­ter­view, adding that the Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent’s ac­tions raised con­sti­tu­tional, reg­u­la­tory and pro­ce­dural ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Healey added that coun­ter­parts i n Vir­ginia, Penn­syl­va­nia, Min­nesota, North Carolina, Washington and other states were con­fer­ring.</p>
    <p>North Carolina At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Josh Stein de­clined to say how many states were par­tic­i­pat­ing in the le­gal dis­cus­sions, adding that North Carolina res­i­dents could re­quest bal­lots now and gen­eral bal­lots would be sent to vot­ers start­ing on Sept 4.</p>
    <p>“There are many states that share this con­cern about what the Pres­i­dent and the Post­mas­ter Gen­eral are do­ing to the Postal Ser­vice, and are re­view­ing all le­gal op­tions avail­able to us to pro­tect the in­tegrity of these elec­tions,” Mr Stein told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Ms Pelosi, the coun­try’s top elected Democrat, said on Sun­day that she was call­ing the Demo­cratic-con­trolled House back to Washington later this week to vote on leg­is­la­tion to pro­tect the Postal Ser­vice from what she called Mr Trump’s “cam­paign to sab­o­tage the elec­tion by ma­nip­u­lat­ing the Postal</p>
    <p>Ser­vice to dis­en­fran­chise vot­ers”.</p>
    <p>A se­nior Demo­cratic aide said House law­mak­ers would likely re­turn on Satur­day to vote on the Bill, which would pro­hibit changes to Postal Ser­vice lev­els that were in place on Jan 1 this year.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Sen­ate Ma­jor­ity</p>
    <p>Leader Mitch McCon­nell said there were no sched­ul­ing updates for the Repub­li­can-con­trolled Sen­ate.</p>
    <p>But Repub­li­can Se­na­tor Su­san Collins of Maine, a mod­er­ate locked in a tight re-elec­tion race, said on Twit­ter that the Sen­ate should re­turn this week to con­sider leg­is­la­tion to pro­vide the Postal Ser­vice up to US$25 bil­lion (S$34.2 bil­lion) in coro­n­avirus fund­ing.</p>
    <p>Con­gres­sional Democrats also called on Mr DeJoy, a Trump donor, and Postal Ser­vice chair­man Robert Dun­can to tes­tify at an Aug 24 hear­ing of the House Com­mit­tee on Over­sight and Re­form.</p>
    <p>Sen­ate Demo­cratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the Postal Ser­vice’s board of gov­er­nors should re­move Mr DeJoy if he “re­fuses to come be­fore Congress”. Mr DeJoy did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>White House Chief of Staff Mark Mead­ows told CNN’s State of the Union on Sun­day that the White House feared a surge in mail-in vot­ing could de­lay elec­tion re­sults and leave the nam­ing of the new pres­i­dent to the Speaker of the House.</p>
    <p>“A num­ber of states are now try­ing to fig­ure out how they are go­ing to go to uni­ver­sal mail-in bal­lots,” Mr Mead­ows said.</p>
    <p>“That’s a dis­as­ter where we won’t know the elec­tion re­sults on Nov 3 and we might not know it for months and for me that’s prob­lem­atic be­cause the Con­sti­tu­tion says that then a Nancy Pelosi in the House would ac­tu­ally pick the pres­i­dent on Jan 20.”</p>

Mr DeJoy has come un&#xAD;der fire for changes made at the US Postal Ser&#xAD;vice that could pos&#xAD;si&#xAD;bly hold up mail-in bal&#xAD;lots in Novem&#xAD;ber&#x2019;s elec&#xAD;tion.</p>
