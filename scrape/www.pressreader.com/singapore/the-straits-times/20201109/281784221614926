    <p>MIF­FLINTOWN (Penn­syl­va­nia) • It does not get much “red­der” in Penn­syl­va­nia than Ju­ni­ata County, a pre­dom­i­nantly white and ru­ral re­gion dot­ted with pic­turesque churches, live­stock farms and fac­to­ries which US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump car­ried in the election with 80 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>So it was with dis­ap­point­ment, sus­pi­cion and res­ig­na­tion that res­i­dents took in news last Satur­day that their state had tipped the pres­i­den­tial race in Mr Joe Bi­den’s favour, deny­ing Mr Trump an­other four years.</p>
    <p>“It’s sick­en­ing and sad,” said Ms Kayla Doyle, man­ager of a pub in Mif­flintown, the Ju­ni­ata county seat about 72km north-west of Har­ris­burg, the state cap­i­tal. “I think it’s rigged,” the 35-year-old added.</p>
    <p>As sup­port­ers of Mr Bi­den cel­e­brated across Amer­ica, crowds of Trump sup­port­ers gath­ered with vows to con­tinue fight­ing the re­sults, and tense scenes be­gan to un­fold at com­pet­ing events.</p>
    <p>In Har­ris­burg, while some Bi­den sup­port­ers danced in cel­e­bra­tion, car­ry­ing signs bear­ing mes­sages like “The Peo­ple Have Spo­ken”, hun­dreds of Trump sup­port­ers chanted “Stop The Steal”, em­brac­ing the Pres­i­dent’s base­less claims of election fraud.</p>
    <p>Many car­ried long guns, and po­lice in­ter­vened to keep op­pos­ing groups sep­a­rated.</p>
    <p>One man who said he was part of the far-right Proud Boys, a group no­to­ri­ous for vi­o­lence, held a sign that said “Stand­ing Back, Stand­ing By, Mr Pres­i­dent” – a ref­er­ence to Mr Trump’s com­ments about the group dur­ing a pres­i­den­tial de­bate in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>In Salem, Ore­gon, videos showed a per­son wear­ing Proud Boys ap­parel us­ing pep­per spray on some­one.</p>
    <p>In Lans­ing, Michi­gan, Trump sup­port­ers chanted “Whose streets? Our streets?” and re­peated Mr Trump’s false claim that he had won the election.</p>
    <p>There was a brief fight in the crowd, which in­cluded armed peo­ple on both sides. Trump sup­porter Curtis Udell, 56, who car­ried an AR-15 ri­fle, said: “They’re never go­ing to con­vince me that he didn’t win.”</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers in Phoenix chanted “We want audits!” One speaker told the crowd: “We will win in court!”</p>
    <p>They wore red Trump hats, held signs read­ing “Stop The Steal” and waved Amer­i­can flags or Trump ban­ners bear­ing the slo­gan “Keep Amer­ica Great”.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds gath­ered in front of the Ari­zona state capi­tol build­ing in Phoenix, some with their dogs dressed in Trump shirts.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Donna McCol­lum, 77, who said she can trace her fam­ily his­tory back to the Amer­i­can rev­o­lu­tion, re­peated Mr Trump’s claim of fraud. “The elec­toral col­lege is the one to de­cide... And there’s a lot of fraud. It needs to be ei­ther re­done to­tally or re­counted.”</p>
    <p>She added: “Look at these peo­ple out here. There’s no way Bi­den won Ari­zona.”</p>
    <p>Trump cam­paign man­ager Bill Stepien has urged sup­port­ers to be ready to at­tend protests that the cam­paign is “prop­ping up around the coun­try”, said a per­son fa­mil­iar with the sit­u­a­tion. “At a mo­ment’s in­stance, we may need your help at protests in your states, to make sure the Pres­i­dent is rep­re­sented and our side of the ar­gu­ment is shown,” Mr Stepien said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s win in Penn­syl­va­nia, called by all ma­jor TV net­works, gave him the 20 elec­toral col­lege votes he needed to pre­vail. But it was achieved by run­ning up big mar­gins in and around Philadel­phia and Pitts­burgh, with less-pop­u­lated ar­eas like Ju­ni­ata – with about 25,000 peo­ple – strongly be­hind Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The ru­ral-ur­ban di­vide high­lights the daunt­ing task Mr Bi­den faces to win over vot­ers out­side the big ci­ties who are scep­ti­cal of his agenda and be­lieve Mr Trump was the first pres­i­dent to gov­ern with their in­ter­ests at heart.</p>
    <p>Mr Herbie Stoner, 53, said he was sus­pi­cious of the Demo­cratic Party and the in­tegrity of the vote. Although wor­ried that a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would not be able to match the job growth Mr Trump de­liv­ered to the re­gion, Mr Stoner said he was will­ing to give the pres­i­dent-elect a chance. “We are go­ing to have to ac­cept it and hope he does the best for our coun­try,” said Mr Stoner, who works for a sep­tic ser­vice com­pany in Ju­ni­ata County. “If he steps up and does his job, we’re all for him.”</p>
