    <p>When you think of the Covid-19 pan­demic, one item prob­a­bly sym­bol­ises it more than any other: the dis­pos­able mask.</p>
    <p>Across the globe, manda­tory mask wear­ing has saved count­less lives and made ev­ery­day life safer.</p>
    <p>But the surge in mask use has a dark side. It is es­ti­mated that bil­lions of masks are used daily across the globe and this is cre­at­ing a grow­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal prob­lem that could last much longer than the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dis­pos­able masks are made from plas­tics, which can take decades to break down in the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to mask us­age, the pan­demic has led to a surge in other plas­tic waste, from sin­gleuse food con­tain­ers and bags to huge amounts of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) from hos­pi­tals and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tion­ists and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions are in­creas­ingly con­cerned that a lot of the plas­tic waste, es­pe­cially Covid-19-re­lated waste, is end­ing up in land­fills, wa­ter­ways and oceans, adding to the mil­lions of tonnes of plas­tic waste al­ready dumped into the world’s oceans ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>Dr Ge­orge Leonard, chief sci­en­tist at US-based Ocean Con­ser­vancy, said: “With­out ques­tion, pan­demic-re­lated gear like gloves and masks are hurt­ing sea life.</p>
    <p>“Sea birds, tur­tles and other ocean an­i­mals can get tan­gled up in mask elas­tics, or choke on masks and gloves that end up along shore­lines or in the wa­ter.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sub­hash Chan­dran, 32, knows the threat well. He has been div­ing un­der­wa­ter to clean up the seabed i n the coastal city of Visakha­p­at­nam in Andhra Pradesh, In­dia.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, when vol­un­teers did their first un­der­wa­ter cleanup dur­ing the pan­demic, they saw the ocean choked with masks, gloves and empty medicine sa­chets.</p>
    <p>“Nor­mally we find a lot of plas­tic bot­tles and wrap­pers. Af­ter the pan­demic, we found 1,500kg of mostly N95 masks, sur­gi­cal masks, tablet pack­ets and gloves.</p>
    <p>“I con­sider the ocean my sec­ond home, but it is a Covid-19 dump yard to­day,” Mr Chan­dran said.</p>
    <p>In Jakarta and Manila, l arge amounts of Covid-19 waste, from masks to gowns, are dumped in land­fills or along the road­side. Some find their way into rivers and seas.</p>
    <p>While of­fi­cials have been try­ing to im­prove on col­lec­tion and dis­posal, es­pe­cially from hos­pi­tals, large amounts are still be­ing dumped rather than in­cin­er­ated.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines ranks sec­ond in South-east Asia with the most num­ber of Covid-19 cases af­ter In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“We can just imag­ine how stag­ger­ing the fig­ures would be for the dis­pos­able per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment be­ing used daily and dis­carded,” said Ms Glo­ria Ramos, vice-pres­i­dent of con­ser­va­tion or­gan­i­sa­tion Oceana Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>“Sin­gle-use plas­tic is al­ready a prob­lem. What we’re see­ing on the sur­face is only the tip of the ice­berg.”</p>
    <p>“There’s so much ly­ing on the ocean floor, and now not just plas­tics but face masks too,” said Ms Ramos.</p>
    <p>UNMASKING THE THREAT</p>
    <p>So how great is the threat from masks?</p>
    <p>That is still un­clear but ev­i­dence from The Straits Times cor­re­spon­dents in In­done­sia, In­dia and the Philip­pines point to wor­ry­ing signs. ST also in­ter­viewed a va­ri­ety of ex­perts who point to an emerg­ing prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Dr Denise Hardesty, a marine plas­tic waste sci­en­tist from Aus­tralia’s na­tional sci­ence agency CSIRO, said more data is needed to get a clearer pic­ture.</p>
    <p>“One would an­tic­i­pate that it would be an is­sue, par­tic­u­larly be­cause peo­ple are go­ing to be much less likely to want to pick up a lit­tered mask on the ground than they would, say, a candy wrap­per, be­cause peo­ple would have fear around Covid-19,” she told ST.</p>
    <p>She noted that the coro­n­avirus out­break has led to a huge in­crease in mask us­age but in South-east Asia, it was al­ready com­mon to wear masks prior to the pan­demic, so more data is needed on pre-pan­demic and cur­rent mask us­age.</p>
    <p>What is clear, though, is that masks and other PPE waste are al­ready wash­ing up on beaches around the globe.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Coastal Cleanup run by Ocean Con­ser­vancy has recorded tens of thou­sands of pieces of PPE as of early Novem­ber, with more de­tailed data ex­pected in the com­ing months, Dr Leonard said.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate coastal cleanup, thou­sands of PPE items, mainly masks and gloves, were also recorded dur­ing a three-week waste col­lec­tion ex­er­cise in­volv</p>
    <p>A mask on the seabed in Ani­lao town in the Philip­pines’ Batan­gas prov­ince.</p>
    <p>ing par­tic­i­pants from 78 coun­tries dur­ing Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber last year. The cleanup was or­gan­ised by the Al­liance to End Plas­tic Waste, an in­dus­try body.</p>
    <p>Mask man­u­fac­tur­ing has rapidly be­come a multi-bil­lion-dol­lar in­dus­try to meet spi­ralling de­mand.</p>
    <p>Last June, re­searchers es­ti­mated that 129 bil­lion masks were used and dis­posed of ev­ery month. At roughly 3.5g each, that equates to 451,500 tonnes of masks a month and would cover an area roughly three times the size of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>One of the au­thors of the study, Pro­fes­sor Tony Walker from the School for Re­source and En­vi­ron­men­tal Stud­ies at Dal­housie Univer­sity in Canada, told ST that es­ti­mate may now be con­ser­va­tive.</p>
    <p>“Now it’s a full-blown pan­demic. With many coun­tries hav­ing manda­tory non-med­i­cal mask wear­ing in public places, the num­bers would be even more stag­ger­ing.”</p>
    <p>A study pub­lished last Septem­ber by Bri­tish site fin­der.com es­ti­mated that Bri­tons were send­ing more than 1.6 bil­lion dis­pos­able masks to land­fills each month.</p>
    <p>FOR­EVER PLAS­TIC</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic show­ing no signs of slow­ing, sin­gle-use masks will con­tinue to be used in large num­bers for some time to come.</p>
    <p>“We are in a health cri­sis at a global level and there’s a strong en­cour­age­ment across all coun­tries in terms of the use of sin­gle-use or re­us­able masks. And I think that num­ber will only go up as we go for</p>
    <p>ward,” said Mr Ja­cob Duer, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore-based Al­liance to End Plas­tic Waste, which is working on so­lu­tions to re­duce plas­tic waste glob­ally and boost re­cy­cling.</p>
    <p>But he said in the long term, sin­gle-use mask us­age will not nec­es­sar­ily con­tinue to rise. “I think it will see a flat­ten­ing out at one point be­cause we will tran­si­tion to re­us­able masks.”</p>
    <p>Asia re­mains a key fo­cus for the group be­cause of the huge amounts of mis­man­aged plas­tic waste in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Bu­rangkeng dump­site on the eastern edge of In­done­sia’s cap­i­tal pro­vides an ex­am­ple. Sur­gi­cal masks and rub­ber gloves are mixed in with daily house­hold rub­bish, as goats scav­enge the trash for food.</p>
    <p>Waste picker Oom Ko­ma­lasari, 48, said prior to the pan­demic, she of­ten found med­i­cal waste such as nee­dles and in­tra­venous fluid bot­tles scat­tered among other garbage. Now, there are more.</p>
    <p>“Nearby fac­to­ries dis­pose of their masks and gloves here, and many more have been thrown here lately,” she said.</p>
    <p>For Dr Leonard, the surge in pro­duc­tion and use of Covid-19-linked sin­gle-use plas­tics will likely haunt hu­man­ity and the en­vi­ron­ment for years to come. “Per­haps what’s so trou­bling is that plas­tics never break down, so we re­ally can’t op­er­ate with an ‘out of sight, out of mind’ at­ti­tude,” he said.</p>
