    <p>LOS ANGELES • For months, the Amer­i­can en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try’s le­gal cal­en­dar had an in­trigu­ing item on the hori­zon: a copy­right trial pit­ting Tracy Chap­man (right), the revered and reclu­sive singer-song­writer, against fire­brand rap­per Nicki Mi­naj (right be­low).</p>
    <p>But that trial is not to be.</p>
    <p>Late last month, the par­ties agreed to a judg­ment of copy­right in­fringe­ment against Mi­naj, and a pay­ment of US$450,000 (S$596,400) to Chap­man, ac­cord­ing to doc­u­ments made public last Thurs­day in fed­eral court in Cal­i­for­nia, where the case was be­ing ad­ju­di­cated.</p>
    <p>Chap­man, 56, sued Mi­naj, 38, for copy­right i nfringe­ment i n late 2018 over a song called Sorry, which bor­rowed heav­ily f rom Chap­man’s Baby Can I Hold You, re­leased in 1988.</p>
    <p>The as­pect of the case that drew the at­ten­tion of le­gal schol­ars and en­ter­tain­ment lit­i­ga­tors was that Mi­naj’s song, which she recorded with rap­per Nas, was never of­fi­cially re­leased, although it had been played on the ra­dio by Funkmas­ter Flex, a celebrity DJ on the New York ra­dio sta­tion Hot 97.</p>
    <p>Chap­man ac­cused Mi­naj of us­ing Baby Can I Hold You with­out per­mis­sion, which she said Mi­naj had asked for but was de­nied.</p>
    <p>Yet Mi­naj ar­gued that her cre­ation of Sorry, even with­out a li­cence from Chap­man, was pro­tected by the doc­trine of “fair use” – an ex­cep­tion to copy­right law that lets cre­ators bor­row copy­righted ma­te­rial un­der cer­tain con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Judge Vir­ginia Phillips, of the United States District Court in Los Angeles, sided with Mi­naj on the ques­tion of fair use.</p>
    <p>In a sum­mary judg­ment de­ci­sion, Judge Phillips wrote that “up­root­ing” the com­mon prac­tice of let­ting artistes ex­per­i­ment pri­vately “would limit cre­ativ­ity and sti­fle in­no­va­tion within the mu­sic in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>But the judge al­lowed the case to go to trial over the ques­tion of how the song made its way to Funkmas­ter Flex. Chap­man’s side al­leged that Mi­naj had leaked it and pointed to sub­stan­tial cor­re­spon­dence be­tween the two.</p>
    <p>Mi­naj said she did not send the track and Funkmas­ter Flex said he got it “from one of his blog­gers”, ac­cord­ing to the judge’s rul­ing.</p>
    <p>If Mi­naj had leaked the song her­self, or au­tho­rised its re­lease through in­ter­me­di­aries, she may have been li­able for sig­nif­i­cant penal­ties.</p>
    <p>Court pa­pers show that Mi­naj’s lawyers made their of­fer of US$450,000, “in­clu­sive of all costs and at­tor­ney fees i ncurred to date”, on Dec 17 and that Chap­man’s team ac­cepted it on Dec 30.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last Fri­day, Chap­man said she was pleased with the out­come, “which af­firms that artistes’ rights are pro­tected by law and should be re­spected by other artistes”.</p>
    <p>When asked for com­ment about the con­clu­sion of the case, Mr Peter Ross, a lawyer for Mi­naj, said: “We set­tled for one rea­son only. It would have cost us more to go to trial.”</p>
