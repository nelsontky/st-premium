    <p>Some read­ers who are not Sin­ga­pore­ans might un­der­stand­ably be puz­zled by ref­er­ences to “3G” or “4G”, which means third gen­er­a­tion and fourth gen­er­a­tion re­spec­tively. There­fore, be­fore I dis­cuss the tran­si­tion to the 4G lead­er­ship, it may be use­ful to quickly re­cap the dif­fer­ent gen­er­a­tions of lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>A dif­fer­ent “G” la­bel – in­di­cat­ing a dis­tinct gen­er­a­tional change – for dif­fer­ent prime min­is­ters’ Cab­i­nets is some­what of a mis­nomer, and per­haps even mis­lead­ing.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause each prime min­is­ter had a mix of min­is­ters who were new and young, as well as older and more ex­pe­ri­enced. Sev­eral min­is­ters served in the Cab­i­nets of more than one prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, I was one of the few min­is­ters who had the unique priv­i­lege of hav­ing served all three prime min­is­ters. I was first elected as a Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment in 1980, ap­pointed as a min­is­ter of state in 1981, and be­came a full min­is­ter in 1984, and I stepped down in 2011.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew’s Gen­er­a­tion of Lead­ers (1G)</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, PM Lee Kuan Yew’s team was the 1G lead­er­ship, al­though hardly any­one uses that term to re­fer to the found­ing fa­thers’ group. PM Lee Kuan Yew’s key Cabi­net col­leagues in­cluded Goh Keng Swee, S. Ra­jarat­nam, Toh Chin Chye, Ed­die Barker, Ong Pang Boon and Oth­man Wok.</p>
    <p>PM Lee Kuan Yew served as PM for 31 years. In the lat­ter half of the 1970s, he brought into his team younger peo­ple whom he hoped to test out to form the next gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers. They in­cluded Goh Chok Tong, Tony Tan, Ong Teng Cheong, S. Dhan­a­balan, Lim Chee Onn and my­self.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong’s Gen­er­a­tion of Lead­ers (2G)</p>
    <p>Goh Chok Tong be­came Prime Min­is­ter in 1990 and stepped down in 2004, serv­ing as PM for close to 14 years.</p>
    <p>The process by which the 2G lead­ers se­lected him has been re­counted, first by my­self and later, by Goh Chok Tong him­self.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 1984, Tony Tan or­gan­ised a cof­fee/or­ange juice ses­sion at his home, at­tended by Ong Teng Cheong, S. Dhan­a­balan, Yeo Ning Hong, Ah­mad Mat­tar, Lee Hsien Loong and my­self. Chok Tong him­self joined the meet­ing later. Sev­eral min­is­ters of state were also present.</p>
    <p>It was not a lengthy meet­ing and we de­cided that the leader of the team should be Goh Chok Tong.</p>
    <p>PM Goh Chok Tong’s team of key min­is­ters in­cluded those present at that meet­ing, as well as Wong Kan Seng, Lim Hng Kiang and Lim Boon Heng.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s Gen­er­a­tion of Lead­ers (3G)</p>
    <p>Lee Hsien Loong, who en­tered pol­i­tics in 1984, be­came Prime Min­is­ter in 2004, and at the time of writ­ing, he has served 16 years as Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, he was Deputy Prime Min­is­ter for al­most 14 years in Goh Chok Tong’s Cabi­net.</p>
    <p>PM Lee Hsien Loong’s 3G team of key min­is­ters in­cluded Teo Chee Hean, Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, Ng Eng Hen, K. Shanmugam, Lim Hng Kiang, Wong Kan Seng, Vi­vian Balakrishn­an, Khaw Boon Wan, Ge­orge Yeo, Yaa­cob Ibrahim, Mah Bow Tan and my­self.</p>
    <p>The process of se­lect­ing Lee Hsien Loong as PM was sim­pler. He had been ap­pointed as DPM in 1990 and his per­for­mance as DPM had been out­stand­ing. None of us in PM Goh Chok Tong’s Cabi­net had any doubts that he should suc­ceed Goh Chok Tong as Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Some­time in mid-2004, Wong Kan Seng or­gan­ised a lunch among min­is­ters at his of­fice and as Lim</p>
    <p>Boon Heng re­called it, the meet­ing was short be­cause “the choice [of Lee Hsien Loong] was clear”.</p>
    <p>How did the 4G De­cide on new lead­ers?</p>
    <p>The process of se­lect­ing the 4G lead­ers was also dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2017, Goh Chok Tong, who was then Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter, nudged the 4G team to set­tle the ques­tion of lead­er­ship early so that PM Lee Hsien Loong could set­tle on his suc­ces­sor by the end of 2018.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 4G team did not want to be rushed into a de­ci­sion and on Jan 4, 2018, 16 min­is­ters from the 4G is­sued a joint state­ment that they were “con­scious of their re­spon­si­bil­ity, are work­ing closely to­gether as a team and will set­tle on a leader from among us in good time”.</p>
    <p>On Nov 23, 2018, al­most 11 months later, 32 min­is­ters and Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment is­sued a joint state­ment: “Now we have a con­sen­sus that the team will be led by Swee Keat.”</p>
    <p>They also noted that Heng Swee Keat had asked Chan Chun Sing to be his deputy, and Chun Sing had agreed to this.</p>
    <p>In their joint state­ment, they said: “We en­dorse and sup­port Swee Keat and Chun Sing as our lead­ers.”</p>
    <p>This ended months of spec­u­la­tion at that time on who the next PM might be.</p>
    <p>On April 23, 2019, PM Lee ap­pointed Heng Swee Keat as his DPM with ef­fect from May 1, 2019.</p>
    <p>This re­in­forced the ex­pec­ta­tion that he would be­come Sin­ga­pore’s next prime min­is­ter some­time af­ter Gen­eral Elec­tion 2020 (GE2020). It seemed that the only ques­tion was when PM Lee would step down.</p>
    <p>Be­fore 2020, PM Lee Hsien Loong had hoped to step down by his 70th birth­day</p>
    <p>In mid-2017, PM Lee Hsien Loong set out his thoughts on how long he planned to re­main as Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He said that the next gen­eral elec­tion (which was held on July</p>
    <p>10, 2020) would be the last that he would lead as Prime Min­is­ter, and added that he hoped to step down be­fore he turned 70 years of age (which would be in Fe­bru­ary 2022).</p>
    <p>Go­ing by this, Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­pected to have a 4G prime min­is­ter some­time in 2021 or</p>
    <p>2022.</p>
    <p>Many Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­pected</p>
    <p>and hoped that af­ter step­ping down as PM, Lee Hsien Loong would con­tinue to be in the Cabi­net, just as for­mer prime min­is­ters Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong did af­ter they stepped down as PM.</p>
    <p>I asked PM Lee Hsien Loong if he had an­nounced his in­ten­tions pre­ma­turely</p>
    <p>Af­ter PM Lee an­nounced his in­ten­tion to step down af­ter the fol­low­ing gen­eral elec­tion (held in July 2020), many peo­ple were con­cerned and dis­ap­pointed. They in­cluded not only my friends but also some taxi driv­ers with whom I some­times had in­ter­est­ing con­ver­sa­tions dur­ing taxi rides.</p>
    <p>They won­dered why he made that an­nounce­ment when the iden­tity of his suc­ces­sor was not yet known, and even if it was known, such a per­son would have to be tested.</p>
    <p>They asked: “Why could PM Lee not have waited?” Af­ter all, he was young and fit enough for at least two, if not three more terms. They hoped PM Lee would change his mind and urged me to per­suade him to do so if I should meet him.</p>
    <p>These con­cerned peo­ple agreed that the key mem­bers of the 4G – Heng Swee Keat, Chan Chun Sing, Tan Chuan-Jin, Ong Ye Kung and Lawrence Wong – all ap­peared to be ca­pa­ble and com­pe­tent, but still, they ex­pressed some reser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>Some were con­cerned about Heng Swee Keat’s health, as he had suf­fered a stroke in May 2016 be­cause of an aneurysm. He was tipped to be the leader of the 4G. For­tu­nately, Heng Swee Keat made a com­plete re­cov­ery af­ter im­me­di­ate surgery.</p>
    <p>Other typ­i­cal com­ments they made were: “they are not ready” or “they do not have enough ex­pe­ri­ence in pol­i­tics”.</p>
    <p>I re­minded them that I my­self had been pulled out from the univer­sity with zero ex­pe­ri­ence in pol­i­tics and af­ter one year of be­ing a Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment, I was ap­pointed to po­lit­i­cal of­fice, first as min­is­ter of state, then as full min­is­ter. The only non-aca­demic ex­pe­ri­ence I had was serv­ing as Sin­ga­pore’s Per­ma­nent Rep­re­sen­ta­tive to the United Na­tions from 1971 to 1974.</p>
    <p>There were sev­eral oth­ers in the 2G team who also be­came min­is­ters with­out any prior po­lit­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>PM Lee Hsien Loong used to in­vite me to lunch pe­ri­od­i­cally, mainly to dis­cuss our prepa­ra­tions for Malaysia’s ap­pli­ca­tion to re­vise</p>
    <p>the In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice’s 2008 Judg­ment on the Pe­dra Branca case. (I was chair­man of the In­ter-Min­istry Com­mit­tee pre­par­ing for that case.)</p>
    <p>Dur­ing one such lunch in the later part of 2017, I told him about the feed­back I had re­ceived.</p>
    <p>He said he was aware and, in fact, had also re­ceived such feed­back. How­ever, he had clearly given the mat­ter care­ful thought.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that if he post­poned the time­line, it would not be good for Sin­ga­pore. He would be much older, and so too would be his suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>It would be bet­ter if the new PM and his key team mem­bers were to take over ear­lier. I found his ex­pla­na­tion per­sua­sive.</p>
    <p>He was de­ter­mined in not want­ing to stay on as the na­tion’s leader longer than nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>All this was, of course, be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Re­vis­it­ing PM Lee Hsien Loong’s time­line on suc­ces­sion dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic and post-GE2020</p>
    <p>Af­ter the on­set of the Covid-19 pan­demic and af­ter GE2020, the views that PM Lee should re­main longer at the helm have in­ten­si­fied.</p>
    <p>When PM Lee had ear­lier ex­pressed his thoughts about when he would step down, no­body had ex­pected the tu­mul­tuous calamity that Covid-19 would in­flict upon Sin­ga­pore and the world.</p>
    <p>It is Sin­ga­pore’s worst cri­sis. It has had grave con­se­quences for the health and lives of the peo­ple as well as Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>All signs point to a long-drawn-out cri­sis. PM Lee has clearly re­alised that we are in an ex­tra­or­di­nary sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>At his on­line Fuller­ton Rally Speech on July 6, 2020 dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign, he said he had not ex­pected to en­counter such “an over­whelm­ing cri­sis” in the last stretch of his premier­ship, and added: “You have my word: To­gether with my older col­leagues like Teo Chee Hean and Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, as well as the 4G min­is­ters, I will see this through. I am de­ter­mined to hand over Sin­ga­pore in­tact and in good work­ing or­der to the next team.”</p>
    <p>He re­peated this as­sur­ance al­most ver­ba­tim in his tele­vised com­ments on the GE2020 re­sults in the early hours of July 11, 2020.</p>
    <p>He put it an­other way at the press con­fer­ence on July 25, 2020</p>
    <p>on the new Cabi­net line-up: “I do not de­ter­mine the path of the Covid-19 pan­demic, and a lot will de­pend on how events un­fold.”</p>
    <p>I am glad that PM Lee has given him­self some flex­i­bil­ity on the suc­ces­sion time­line. In my view, how­ever ca­pa­ble the 4G lead­ers, we should not change horses in mid­stream.</p>
    <p>An­other ques­tion fur­ther down the road is this: what if the cri­sis takes even longer to abate? What if Sin­ga­pore is still in dire straits in four to five years’ time closer to the next gen­eral elec­tion?</p>
    <p>Would PM Lee also be pre­pared to re­visit his ear­lier in­ten­tion not to lead the next gen­eral elec­tion as PM?</p>
    <p>Of course, if “nor­malcy” has been re­stored be­fore the next GE, I think the public will sup­port his de­sire to step down as PM. How­ever, if the cri­sis per­sists, I be­lieve many Sin­ga­pore­ans will want him to re­con­sider that as­pect of his time­line as well, and hand over only af­ter Sin­ga­pore has turned the dan­ger­ous cor­ner.</p>
    <p>It is, of course, still early days, but that sce­nario has to be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>Much will de­pend on the suc­cess of mea­sures taken to ad­dress both the health and eco­nomic fronts.</p>
    <p>Quite apart from the pan­demic, the com­ing four or five years will see a volatile ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment, es­pe­cially with ten­sions ris­ing be­tween the United States and China. Sin­ga­pore will need a pair of safe, ex­pe­ri­enced hands dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Whether one or both as­pects of PM Lee’s time­line are ad­justed, there will likely be some slip­page in his sched­ule for hand­ing over the reins to the 4G team.</p>
    <p>The 4G lead­ers have shown a steady hand un­der very dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances. I and many other Sin­ga­pore­ans were en­cour­aged by the calm and un­ruf­fled man­ner in which they tack­led the many twists and turns of the Covid-19 cri­sis. In their reg­u­lar TV brief­ings, they were trans­par­ent in set­ting out the facts, and con­fi­dent in mak­ing and ex­plain­ing de­ci­sions as the out­break pro­gressed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, PM Lee’s in­di­ca­tion that he will see the cri­sis through, in my view, gives a valu­able op­por­tu­nity to the younger 4G min­is­ters (and even some of those newly elected MPs who were also made of­fice-hold­ers) to learn from PM Lee and the more se­nior min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>It is just like how I and my gen­er­a­tion of min­is­ters con­sider our­selves most for­tu­nate to have learnt from the likes of Lee Kuan Yew, S. Ra­jarat­nam and Goh Keng Swee.</p>
    <p>View­ing po­lit­i­cal suc­ces­sion in con­text</p>
    <p>I have al­luded to the pos­si­bil­ity that PM Lee’s ear­lier planned sched­ule for hand­ing over the reins to his suc­ces­sor may have to be ad­justed.</p>
    <p>When­ever any suc­ces­sion looms on the hori­zon, it is in­evitable that there will be spec­u­la­tion, con­cerns and even anx­i­ety. It is there­fore im­por­tant to view the is­sue of po­lit­i­cal suc­ces­sion in con­text.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, let me make the fol­low­ing gen­eral ob­ser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>Firstly, Sin­ga­pore is for­tu­nate in that all three prime min­is­ters care­fully planned for suc­ces­sion. Such suc­ces­sion plan­ning has brought about many years of sta­bil­ity and con­ti­nu­ity for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In this re­gard, I re­call that at the swear­ing-in cer­e­mony of his eighth Cabi­net in 1988, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew said that one of the im­por­tant qual­i­ties by which po­lit­i­cal lead­ers are judged is “by the way they have pro­vided for con­ti­nu­ity so that a suc­ces­sor Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to pro­tect and ad­vance the in­ter­ests of their peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Se­condly, lead­er­ship suc­ces­sion is never any easy task in any coun­try. Some coun­tries do not con­sciously plan for it. Even when they do, things do not al­ways go ac­cord­ing to plan.</p>
    <p>The next leader may emerge un­ex­pect­edly from nowhere with lit­tle or no ex­pe­ri­ence in gov­ern­ment. Some­times, even a well-known fig­ure, like Win­ston Churchill who en­joyed enor­mous per­sonal pres­tige af­ter lead­ing Bri­tain to vic­tory in World War II, can be booted out from of­fice.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, even in coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore where lead­ers sys­tem­at­i­cally plan for and groom suc­ces­sor teams, there can be bumps and hic­cups along the way.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it is well known that there were strong dis­agree­ments in the tran­si­tion to 2G. Some of the old guard did not agree with the pace set by PM Lee.</p>
    <p>More com­pli­ca­tions arose when PM Lee Kuan Yew pub­licly said that Goh Chok Tong had not been his first choice as his suc­ces­sor. Fur­ther­more, to prod Chok Tong into im­prov­ing his public speak­ing skills, PM Lee Kuan Yew de­scribed him as “wooden”.</p>
    <p>To his credit, Goh Chok Tong took all this in his stride. He proved to be a good prime min­is­ter, and he and the 2G en­sured that the tran­si­tion worked smoothly.</p>
    <p>Fourthly, whether PM Lee Hsien Loong retires two years from now or a few years later, the ex­act tim­ing is not the crit­i­cal is­sue. What is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore is that there is no aban­don­ment of the strate­gic im­pulse to plan for and ex­e­cute an or­derly suc­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The tim­ing of hand­ing over to the new team is a tac­ti­cal de­ci­sion, which will de­pend on many fac­tors that ev­ery prime min­is­ter will have to weigh care­fully, but hang­ing on to power can­not be a con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Fifthly, for ef­fec­tive suc­ces­sion plan­ning, we need to have a size­able core of young ca­pa­ble lead­ers who have the po­ten­tial to take over the reins. A pre­req­ui­site is that com­mit­ted and com­pe­tent peo­ple who care deeply about Sin­ga­pore’s fu­ture must be pre­pared to come for­ward and take on re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Of course, to­day, with so­cial me­dia’s re­lent­less and some­times un­fair scru­tiny of the minu­tiae of a po­lit­i­cal can­di­date’s per­son­al­ity, cre­den­tials as well as his past, it will be more dif­fi­cult to per­suade such good peo­ple to serve. How­ever, if good peo­ple shy away, then even the best of suc­ces­sion plan­ning will pro­duce poor re­sults.</p>
    <p>I must con­fess that I too was nearly guilty of not agree­ing to serve. In 1974 when the chair­man of the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party, Dr Toh Chin Chye, first broached the idea of my en­ter­ing pol­i­tics, I de­murred and said that I was not ready. He did not press me.</p>
    <p>Later, in 1979, when Goh Chok Tong, through S. Dhan­a­balan, asked me to stand in the next gen­eral elec­tion, my first re­sponse was that I pre­ferred to con­tinue teach­ing law at the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>But they asked me this ques­tion: “Sup­pos­ing you are on the top of our list, and if you say no, and we have to go down the list and every­body else keeps say­ing no. We then go to the bot­tom of the list and then later, would you re­gret it if things went awry in Sin­ga­pore?”</p>
    <p>When it was put in that way, I found it very dif­fi­cult to refuse.</p>
    <p>I urge ev­ery Sin­ga­porean who may be ap­proached to serve, and who find them­selves re­luc­tant, to care­fully pon­der over the same ques­tion that was put to me decades ago.</p>
    <p>As hy­giene is­sues from pigeons per­sist, se­ri­ous steps should be taken so that we can have a cleaner en­vi­ron­ment in places such as hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Kevin Tan</p>
    <p>Fine those who feed the pigeons first. They are the cul­prits be­hind the in­crease in the pop­u­la­tion. I have seen old folk who think they are do­ing good by feed­ing the pigeons, with­out real­is­ing that when the pi­geon pop­u­la­tion in­creases, the au­thor­i­ties have to take ac­tion to con­trol it.</p>
    <p>Zam Soha</p>
    <p>We should, but let’s first start with the cause of the over­whelm­ing pi­geon pop­u­la­tion in some ar­eas – the peo­ple. Pi­geon culling may be car­ried out, but the birds will keep com­ing back if res­i­dents con­tinue to feed them. Matthew Ang</p>
    <p>No. Leave the pigeons alone.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple reach out to na­ture as a source of stress re­lief. This sup­ports men­tal health in­di­rectly.</p>
    <p>Pigeons and other birds, cats and dogs have a right to live.</p>
    <p>Don’t pun­ish these an­i­mals as an ex­cuse for other prob­lems cre­ated by peo­ple. Tan Kristin</p>
