    <p>A teacher from one of Sin­ga­pore’s top schools en­tered into a re­la­tion­ship with a fe­male stu­dent and com­mit­ted in­de­cent acts on her at his work­place.</p>
    <p>On one oc­ca­sion, he slipped his hand un­der­neath her pinafore and touched her pri­vate parts. On an­other oc­ca­sion, he pressed his body against hers and said: “I can do any­thing now.”</p>
    <p>The of­fences took place in 2011 when the stu­dent was aged 15 and he was 36. The Sin­ga­porean man, now 46, pleaded guilty in a district court yes­ter­day to two charges un­der the Chil­dren and Young Per­sons Act.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the of­fender and the school can­not be dis­closed ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect the iden­tity of the vic­tim, now 24.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the vic­tim re­turned to the school in 2014 as a re­lief teacher and be­gan show­ing signs of an eat­ing dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the man left the school and about two years later, the vic­tim told a woman teacher about the re­la­tion­ship and a po­lice re­port was made in Oc­to­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not say why she de­cided to break her si­lence.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Asoka Markandu told the court the man got to know the vic­tim when he taught her in 2010.</p>
    <p>The of­fender was also the teacher-in-charge of a co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity and she was its stu­dent leader. The man and the girl started to share de­tails about their per­sonal lives in Septem­ber 2010.</p>
    <p>By the end of Fe­bru­ary 2011, they were in a re­la­tion­ship and would hold hands when they were alone in school.</p>
    <p>Some­time be­tween March and May 2011, when they were alone in a room at the school, he grabbed her wrists, held them up against a wall, pressed his body against hers and said: “I can do any­thing now.”</p>
    <p>He re­leased her about 15 sec­onds later, the court heard.</p>
    <p>They were in the room on an­other oc­ca­sion when he touched her pri­vate parts, tak­ing her by sur­prise, the DPP said.</p>
    <p>They broke up shortly af­ter the June 2011 school hol­i­days when he told her the re­la­tion­ship was over. But they con­tin­ued to keep in con­tact with each other.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim re­turned to the school in 2014 as a re­lief teacher for six months, dur­ing which she de­vel­oped an eat­ing dis­or­der. They fi­nally ceased all com­mu­ni­ca­tion in Novem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2018, she told a woman teacher at the school about her re­la­tion­ship with the man. The prin­ci­pal made a po­lice re­port on Oct 2, 2018.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said the man was no longer work­ing for it when the in­ci­dent was re­ported in 2018.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman added: “MOE takes a se­ri­ous view of staff mis­con­duct and will not hes­i­tate to take dis­ci­plinary ac­tion against those who fail to ad­here to our stan­dards of con­duct and dis­ci­pline, in­clud­ing dis­missal from ser­vice.”</p>
    <p>The man is now out on bail of $10,000 and the case has been ad­journed to Dec 8.</p>
