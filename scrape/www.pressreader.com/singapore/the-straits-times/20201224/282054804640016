    <p>Cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) pre­mi­ums ended mostly higher in the last ten­der of 2020 yes­ter­day as car deal­ers made a fi­nal push to shore up sales in a year of pan­demic and pared down sup­ply.</p>
    <p>But on av­er­age, this year’s main car pre­mium (for cars up to 1,600cc) is only slightly higher than last year’s, de­spite the sup­ply of cer­tifi­cates be­ing 25 per cent smaller. Com­pared with the av­er­age in 1999, which had a sim­i­lar quota size, this year’s av­er­age pre­mium is ap­pre­cia­bly lower.</p>
    <p>At the close of yes­ter­day’s ten­der, the COE for cars up to 1,600cc fin­ished 0.4 per cent lower at $40,556. The COE for cars above 1,600cc climbed 9.5 per cent to close at a two-year high of $49,300.</p>
    <p>Open COE, which can be used for any ve­hi­cle type ex­cept mo­tor­cy­cles but which ends up mostly for big­ger cars, rose sim­i­larly to $49,500 – 8.8 per cent higher than its pre­vi­ous close two weeks ago, and its high­est in 19 months.</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE fin­ished 7 per cent higher at $35,201 – its high­est since March 2018. The mo­tor­cy­cle pre­mium crept up by 0.2 per cent to end at a four-month high of $7,689.</p>
    <p>COE sup­ply is de­ter­mined by the num­ber of cars scrapped in a par­tic­u­lar year. And the num­ber of ve­hi­cles be­ing scrapped each year is in­flu­enced by the num­ber of new ones reg­is­tered 10 years ear­lier, as COEs have a life­span of 10 years.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers ex­pect next year’s COE sup­ply to be ei­ther un­changed or slightly larger de­spite the num­ber of new cars reg­is­tered 10 years ear­lier, in 2011, be­ing 33 per cent lower than in 2010.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the short­fall will be made up by some 22,000 cars which had their COEs reval­i­dated for five years in 2016. Five-year re­newals can­not be reval­i­dated fur­ther, and these cars will have to be scrapped in 2021.</p>
    <p>Monthly quo­tas how­ever, may be smaller than this year’s be­cause of the April-June bid­ding sus­pen­sion, which re­sulted in sup­ply be­ing dis­trib­uted over nine months in­stead of 12. Dis­tri­bu­tion is also un­likely to be even through­out the year. For ex­am­ple, the Fe­bru­aryApril 2021 quota may be slightly smaller than the cur­rent three­month quota.</p>
    <p>An un­known is the num­ber of mo­torists who will reval­i­date their car COEs in the next 12 months. These reval­i­dated COEs will not con­trib­ute to 2021’s quota.</p>
    <p>The over­all num­ber of car COE reval­i­da­tions has been shrink­ing since the Covid-19 pan­demic took hold in Sin­ga­pore in Fe­bru­ary. Ten-year reval­i­da­tions for big­ger cars how­ever, re­main largely un­changed from 2019.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket watch­ers reckon that if con­sumer sen­ti­ment and mar­ket con­di­tions re­main un­changed, COE prices for cars up to 1,600cc next year are likely to soften.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists point out that when gov­ern­ment relief mea­sures end next year, more jobs and busi­nesses will be at risk if the pan­demic is not con­trolled.</p>
    <p>An­other wild card could be pri­vate-hire op­er­a­tors look­ing to re­new their fleets in the face of new reg­u­la­tions which dis­cour­age the use of older cars. They are seen to be prop­ping up Cat­e­gory A pre­mi­ums in the last two months.</p>
    <p>How long more their ef­fect will last de­pends much on the widely-an­tic­i­pated merger between the two largest play­ers – Grab and Go­jek. If the union takes place in the first half of the year, their fleets could be con­sol­i­dated, thus cool­ing de­mand for fresh COEs for the sec­ond half of the year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Cat­e­gory B (for cars above 1,600cc) moves to a dif­fer­ent beat. Its av­er­age pre­mium this year is hardly changed at $38,155 de­spite a size­able rise in sup­ply – in­di­cat­ing that the buy­ers are less af­fected by the econ­omy than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Makes which are most ac­tive in this seg­ment are the Euro­pean pre­mium brands, which have also been slash­ing prices to garner mar­ket share. This is likely to con­tinue in 2021, lead­ing to budget cars be­ing fur­ther side­lined.</p>
