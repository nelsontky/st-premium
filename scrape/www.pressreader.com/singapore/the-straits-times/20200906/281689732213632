    <p>GENEVA • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) says it does not ex­pect wide­spread im­mu­ni­sa­tion against the coro­n­avirus un­til the mid­dle of next year, tem­per­ing hopes just as re­search re­vealed en­cour­ag­ing early re­sults from a Rus­sian vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The virus, which has killed about 880,000 peo­ple world­wide, con­tin­ues to spread, with Italy’s flam­boy­ant for­mer prime min­is­ter Sil­vio Ber­lus­coni be­com­ing the lat­est high-pro­file fig­ure to test pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Across the world, gov­ern­ments are hop­ing to an­nounce a vac­cine as soon as pos­si­ble against the virus, which has in­fected more than 26 mil­lion peo­ple, up­ended mil­lions of lives and wreaked havoc on the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions health agency wel­comed the fact that a “con­sid­er­able num­ber” of vac­cine can­di­dates have en­tered fi­nal-stage tri­als, but “in terms of re­al­is­tic time­lines, we are re­ally not ex­pect­ing to see wide­spread vac­ci­na­tion un­til the mid­dle of next year”, WHO spokesman Mar­garet Har­ris said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said the agency would not en­dorse a Covid-19 vac­cine if it is not safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has al­ready ap­proved a vac­cine, and re­search pub­lished in The Lancet med­i­cal jour­nal on Fri­day said pa­tients in­volved in early tests de­vel­oped an­ti­bod­ies with “no se­ri­ous ad­verse events”.</p>
    <p>But sci­en­tists warned that the tri­als were too small – just 76 par­tic­i­pants – to prove safety and ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has also urged US states to get ready for a po­ten­tial vac­cine roll-out by Nov 1, spark­ing con­cerns that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion is rush­ing to start dis­tribut­ing a vac­cine be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>There has been mas­sive pres­sure to roll out a vac­cine quickly as the pan­demic con­tin­ues to take its toll.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Dr Te­dros said “vac­cine na­tion­al­ism” would only slow the ef­fort to quash the pan­demic and called for vac­cines to be used fairly and ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>He said 78 high-in­come coun­tries have now joined the Covax global vac­cine al­lo­ca­tion plan, bring­ing the to­tal to 170 coun­tries, and the “num­ber is grow­ing”.</p>
    <p>He urged oth­ers to join by the Sept 18 dead­line for bind­ing com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the plan guar­an­tees those coun­tries ac­cess to the world’s</p>
    <p>GET PRI­OR­I­TIES RIGHT</p>
    <p>Vac­cine na­tion­al­ism will pro­long the pan­demic, not shorten it. If and when we have an ef­fec­tive vac­cine, we must also use it ef­fec­tively. The first pri­or­ity must be to vac­ci­nate some peo­ple in all coun­tries, rather than all peo­ple in some coun­tries.’’</p>
    <p>DR TE­DROS AD­HANOM GHE­BREYE­SUS, chief of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, call­ing for vac­cines to be used fairly and ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>largest port­fo­lio of vac­cines, with nine can­di­dates now in the pipe­line, he said, adding that a fur­ther four were “promis­ing”.</p>
    <p>WHO chief sci­en­tist Soumya Swami­nathan called it an “op­ti­mistic sce­nario” since the typ­i­cal suc­cess rate of 10 per cent could see sev­eral vac­cines ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The WHO and the Global Al­liance for Vac­cines and Im­mu­ni­sa­tion vac­cine al­liance are lead­ing the Covax Fa­cil­ity, aimed at help­ing to buy and dis­trib­ute vac­ci­na­tion shots fairly around the world.</p>
    <p>But some coun­tries that have se­cured their own sup­plies through bi­lat­eral deals, in­clud­ing the US, have said they will not join Covax.</p>
    <p>“Vac­cine na­tion­al­ism will pro­long the pan­demic, not shorten it,” Dr Te­dros said. “If and when we have an ef­fec­tive vac­cine, we must also use it ef­fec­tively... The first pri­or­ity must be to vac­ci­nate some peo­ple in all coun­tries, rather than all peo­ple in some coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>He added that pri­or­ity should be given to health­care work­ers, the elderly and those with un­der­ly­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros thanked Ger­many, Ja­pan, Nor­way and the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion for join­ing Covax in re­cent days.</p>
