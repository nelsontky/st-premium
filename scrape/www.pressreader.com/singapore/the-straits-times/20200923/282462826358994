    <p>Like many gig econ­omy work­ers, voice-over artists have also been im­pacted by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic hit, gigs dried up, espe­cially dur­ing the twom­onth cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Ms Lyra Beins-Ste­wart, 47, who has 24 years of ex­pe­ri­ence do­ing voice-over work, says she has re­ceived 10 to 20 per cent fewer jobs since the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker, which kicked in on April 7, was an­nounced, she knew it would have an ad­verse im­pact on her work and she de­cided to take ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“I went into my e-mail data­base and sent my con­tacts sam­ples to let them know this is the qual­ity I can give them, to try to se­cure work at the time,” she says.</p>
    <p>Her com­pany, LBS Com­mu­ni­ca­tions & Con­sul­tancy, also rep­re­sents about 50 other voice-over artists. Apart from her­self, 11 of them can pro­duce work from home.</p>
    <p>The pay for voice-over work varies from a cou­ple of hun­dred dol­lars to more than a thou­sand per project.</p>
    <p>Video pro­ducer Adam Tun-Aung, 38, who has his own busi­ness, has been do­ing voice-over work as a side­line for a decade.</p>
    <p>He says even be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, jobs were ir­reg­u­lar – some­times three or four a month, other times none at all.</p>
    <p>Yet, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, he had to fo­cus on voice-over work as there were no gigs for video pro­duc­tion – an­other sec­tor that fell vic­tim to Covid-19. He man­aged to land two voice-over jobs.</p>
    <p>“Though it was re­ally quiet dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, I’ve seen more gigs since phase two,” he says.</p>
    <p>He also re­cently com­pleted projects for the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency statu­tory board and fast-food chain McDon­ald’s.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the pan­demic, voiceover work can­not be done in a pro­fes­sional record­ing stu­dio and artists have to do it from their homes.</p>
    <p>In a pro­fes­sional stu­dio, the artist fo­cuses on de­liv­ery while tak­ing di­rec­tion from the client and pro­ducer. When they record from home, they have to wear all the hats, in­clud­ing those of sound en­gi­neer and ed­i­tor.</p>
    <p>Then there are the tech­ni­cal equip­ment and record­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>To record at home, one would</p>
    <p>MS LYRA BEINS-STE­WART</p>
    <p>need a mi­cro­phone, a com­puter with au­dio record­ing and edit­ing soft­ware, and an au­dio in­ter­face, hard­ware which con­nects the mi­cro­phone to the com­puter (see other story).</p>
    <p>There should also be some form of sound­proof­ing.</p>
    <p>In Mr Tun-Aung’s home, a three­plus-one Hous­ing Board (HDB) flat, this is a makeshift af­fair – pil­lows and blan­kets placed around the mi­cro­phone.</p>
    <p>He is putting up acous­tic foam boards to iso­late the area around the mi­cro­phone, which is a cheaper op­tion than acous­ti­cally treat­ing the en­tire room. Treated rooms typ­i­cally have wall-to-wall foam which ab­sorbs sound, mak­ing for bet­ter recorded au­dio.</p>
    <p>Mr Tun-Aung says he will use his earn­ings from the two voice-over jobs he did dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker to up­grade his home stu­dio.</p>
    <p>Ms Beins-Ste­wart, who has voiced com­mer­cials for baby prod­ucts brand Mamy­poko, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank and DBS Bank, had al­ready set up an acous­ti­cally treated room in her three-room HDB flat five years ago.</p>
    <p>While it is not sound­proof – that kind of work would cost about</p>
    <p>$8,000 to $10,000 – set­ting up the room, which in­cludes a vo­cal booth, set her back by about $2,000.</p>
    <p>“I set up my booth so that I can de­liver (qual­ity record­ings). I had re­ally good feed­back from a very good stu­dio I worked with dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker,” she says.</p>
    <p>For 49-year-old voice-over artist and pro­ducer Mario La­jarca Jr, work­ing from home has been a re­ward­ing ex­pe­ri­ence which he has been shar­ing with his three daugh­ters aged 11, 15 and 18.</p>
    <p>“I get my kids to record me on music soft­ware Pro Tools, and we some­times jam and record songs to­gether,” he says. “It’s a great way to bond with my kids and also teach them some cre­ative au­dio skills.”</p>
    <p>His fam­ily has just moved from a five-room flat to a four-room one and he has plans to turn the bomb shel­ter in his new home into a vo­cal booth.</p>
    <p>Mr La­jarca has done voice-over work for more than 20 years, pro­duced jin­gles and shows for lo­cal ra­dio sta­tions, and hosted pre­re­corded in-flight en­ter­tain­ment shows for mul­ti­ple air­lines.</p>
    <p>He says he was in­formed that his in-flight work for Sin­ga­pore Air­lines will re­sume in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>While these artists say that qual­ity voice-over work can be pro­duced at home, Mr Tun-Aung is look­ing for­ward to getting back in a pro­fes­sional stu­dio.</p>
    <p>“If I’m record­ing at home, I need to do the edit­ing alone at night. I still en­joy it im­mensely, but it’s not the same ex­pe­ri­ence as record­ing in a proper stu­dio.”</p>
    <p>I set up my booth so that I can de­liver (qual­ity record­ings). I had re­ally good feed­back from a very good stu­dio I worked with dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
