    <p>BOS­TON • Trop­i­cal storm Isa­ias strength­ened slightly as it moved past Florida’s coast and it could be­come a hur­ri­cane again as it nears the Caroli­nas. It will then push over the Mid-At­lantic into New York and New Eng­land.</p>
    <p>A hur­ri­cane watch has been is­sued from the South San­tee River in South Carolina, to Surf City, North Carolina.</p>
    <p>Isa­ias could still raise ocean lev­els by up to 122cm above nor­mal from South Carolina to Vir­ginia, as well as sweep­ing the eastern seaboard of the United States with high winds and wring­ing out as much as 15cm of rain in Mid-At­lantic and 10cm in New York and New Eng­land, the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>“Isa­ias is ex­pected to be near hur­ri­cane strength when it reaches the coast of north­ern South Carolina and south­ern North Carolina Mon­day night, and strong trop­i­cal force winds are likely, with hur­ri­cane con­di­tions pos­si­ble,” Mr Stacy Ste­ward, a me­te­o­rol­o­gist with the cen­tre, wrote in his fore­cast.</p>
    <p>A trop­i­cal storm watch has been is­sued for New York City and Long Is­land, the Na­tional Weather Ser­vice said. It is ex­pected to hit the area to­day with wind gusts of up to 80km per hour.</p>
    <p>North Carolina has opened shel­ters for peo­ple flee­ing the storm and will screen for Covid-19 symp­toms, send­ing any­one who tests pos­i­tive to an­other lo­ca­tion where they can be iso­lated and re­ceive med­i­cal at­ten­tion, Gov­er­nor Roy Cooper said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>The state has also ac­ti­vated 150 Na­tional Guard troops to help pre­pare for flood­ing and dam­age.</p>
    <p>Isa­ias di­min­ished from hur­ri­cane strength late last Satur­day and re­mained a trop­i­cal storm through Sun­day. In its weak­ened state it will prob­a­bly cause about US$700 mil­lion (S$960 mil­lion) in dam­age and eco­nomic loss, down from ini­tial es­ti­mates of US$3 bil­lion when it was a hur­ri­cane, Mr Chuck Wat­son, a dis­as­ter mod­eller with Enki Re­search, said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“Plan for power out­ages, street flood­ing, some scat­tered trees down, and have your ra­dio on in case a ran­dom tor­nado forms,” Mr Wat­son wrote in his blog ear­lier. “Plan for some bad weather – hazardous in a few places, but not dan­ger­ous if you don’t do any­thing dumb.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is­sued emer­gency dec­la­ra­tions in Florida, where Isa­ias nearly hit on Sun­day, and North Carolina.</p>
    <p>The storm killed at least one woman in Puerto Rico and caused slight dam­age across the Ba­hamas. It is the ninth At­lantic storm this year, the fastest that such a tally has been reached in records go­ing back to 1851.</p>
