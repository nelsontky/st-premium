    <p>• Ja­pan’s De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono yes­ter­day said he sup­ports Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga as the coun­try’s next leader to pro­vide con­ti­nu­ity in tack­ling the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, but also pre­dicted he would one day be prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Iden­ti­fied early by lo­cal me­dia as a po­ten­tial can­di­date, Mr Kono had con­sid­ered en­ter­ing the lead­er­ship race to re­place re­tir­ing Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, but de­cided against it af­ter Mr Suga an­nounced his de­ci­sion to run.</p>
    <p>“It is i mpor­tant to con­tain Covid-19 and, at the same time, we need to restart the econ­omy,” Mr Kono told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“One day, I will be the prime min­is­ter,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga on Wed­nes­day an­nounced he would run in the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) elec­tion to pick a new leader, promis­ing to stick to Mr Abe’s poli­cies.</p>
    <p>With the back­ing of sev­eral party fac­tions, in­clud­ing the one that Mr Kono is a mem­ber of, Mr Abe’s long-time ally has emerged as the front run­ner in the race.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe an­nounced last Fri­day he was re­sign­ing be­cause of poor health, end­ing his ten­ure as Ja­pan’s long­est-serv­ing prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>A lead­er­ship elec­tion is set for Sept 14, with LDP law­mak­ers and re­gional party rep­re­sen­ta­tives cast­ing votes.</p>
    <p>The win­ner is vir­tu­ally as­sured of be­com­ing prime min­is­ter be­cause of the LDP’s par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Kono, 57, who has also served as for­eign min­is­ter, said he wanted Ja­pan’s next leader to fo­cus on re­build­ing pub­lic fi­nances once the pan­demic ends.</p>
    <p>“We need to se­cure our so­cial se­cu­rity, how we are go­ing to pro­vide so­cial se­cu­rity, pen­sions, med­i­cal and child­care. I think that’s go­ing to be very im­por­tant and that needs to be thor­oughly dis­cussed,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­cated at Ge­orge­town Univer­sity and a flu­ent English speaker, he re­cently hosted a live ques­tion-and-an­swer ses­sion on YouTube, un­usual for Ja­panese politi­cians, to an­swer questions rang­ing from na­tional se­cu­rity to his per­sonal tastes.</p>
    <p>De­spite his rep­u­ta­tion as a mav­er­ick, he has, nonethe­less, toed the line on key Abe poli­cies, in­clud­ing a tough ap­proach to­wards South Korea in a feud over wartime his­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Kono said he was ready “any time” when asked when he wanted to be prime min­is­ter.</p>
