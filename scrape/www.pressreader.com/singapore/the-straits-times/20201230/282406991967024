    <p>Kr­ish­nan Vi­jayan Naidu has been part of suc­cess­ful Sin­ga­pore hockey teams, cap­tur­ing sil­ver and bronze medals at the SEA Games. But it was a short one-year coach­ing stint that ig­nited his real pas­sion in the sport and 25 years later, has seen him be­come the new na­tional men’s head coach.</p>
    <p>In 1995, he took over from Bal­bir</p>
    <p>Singh, who was on a one-year break, as Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion’s hockey coach on an in­terim ba­sis.</p>
    <p>De­spite having no coach­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, Vi­jayan led the team to the Schools Na­tional B Divi­sion boys’ ti­tle, end­ing Yuhua Se­condary’s sixyear reign.</p>
    <p>“After win­ning that cham­pi­onship, I felt that I had some­thing be­yond play­ing. That sparked some­thing in me and I knew that I should take coach­ing se­ri­ously,” the 55-year-old told The Straits</p>
    <p>Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was of­fered a role as a youth de­vel­op­ment coach with the Sin­ga­pore Hockey Fed­er­a­tion (SHF) in 2003 and over the next decade, has coached at more than 15 schools and six clubs.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2016, he was ap­pointed as­sis­tant coach of the na­tional men’s hockey team, who fin­ished third at the 2017 SEA Games and won the In­ter­na­tional Hockey Fed­er­a­tion (FIH) Open Se­ries a year later.</p>
    <p>Vi­jayan of­fi­cially be­gins his new role on Fri­day and a new year brings fresh hopes.</p>
    <p>He has a two-year con­tract and has set his squad a top-two fin­ish at the Asian Hockey Fed­er­a­tion (AHF) Cup next year. Qual­i­fi­ca­tion for the 2022 Asian Games i n Hangzhou is another tar­get.</p>
    <p>Vi­jayan, who takes over from Malaysian K. Ra­jan and is the first lo­cal at the helm since Ron­nie Yeo in 2004, de­scribed his ap­point­ment as a “proud mo­ment”.</p>
    <p>“It’s the dream of all l ocal coaches to one day be able to take the na­tional team. In these four years, I’ve built their trust by show­ing what I’m ca­pa­ble of. Now I just have to so­lid­ify that and re­in­state my vi­sion and goals to the team.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore fin­ished fourth in the pre­vi­ous AHF Cup in 2016, while the last time the men’s team com­peted at the Asiad was in 2014.</p>
    <p>Vi­jayan hopes to in­crease the pool of youth play­ers for the na­tional set-up by invit­ing tal­ented school play­ers to train with the se­nior team.</p>
    <p>“By giv­ing them that op­por­tu­nity, they can ex­pe­ri­ence the high­level in­ten­sity of train­ing and it gives them ex­po­sure. Those with po­ten­tial will move up and even if some have to go for na­tional service, we will not be hin­dered be­cause there are other boys who will fill in the gap,” he said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional men’s cap­tain Nur Ashriq Fer­daus, 27, said Vi­jayan’s fa­mil­iar­ity was a bonus.</p>
    <p>He noted: “He has a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence and un­der him, you can see pro­gres­sion be­cause he fo­cuses not just on tech­ni­cal skills but other things, like speed and weights train­ing, since he knows it’s important to de­velop us holis­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>“He makes train­ing fun and that’s the most important thing be­cause he can get play­ers look­ing for­ward to train­ing.”</p>
    <p>Vi­jayan’s task ahead is daunt­ing though. The last time the men’s team struck gold was at the 1973 South-east Asian Penin­su­lar (Seap) Games and the gap be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia is equally size­able.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore are world No. 36 and Asia’s eighth-high­est side. Re­gional ri­vals Malaysia are 11thranked and the con­ti­nent’s sec­ond-best team after world No. 4 In­dia.</p>
    <p>But SHF pres­i­dent Matha­van De­vadas is con­fi­dent Vi­jayan is the right per­son to mo­ti­vate the play­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “At the end of the day, the play­ers have to be­lieve. Having been the as­sis­tant coach for four years, he has that con­nec­tion with the play­ers and... he’s the best per­son who can make them be­lieve that they can achieve this.”</p>
    <p>FUL­FILL­ING MO­MENT</p>
    <p>It’s the dream of all lo­cal coaches to one day be able to take the na­tional team.</p>
