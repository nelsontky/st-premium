    <p>LON­DON • Judd Trump suf­fered a shock exit from the World Snooker Championsh­ip as the ti­tle holder crashed to a 13-9 quar­ter-fi­nal de­feat against Kyren Wil­son on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old be­came the lat­est vic­tim of the so­called “Cru­cible Curse” which has seen 18 first-time win­ners of the world ti­tle fail to re­tain the crown since the event moved to the Sh­effield venue in 1977.</p>
    <p>He trailed 10-6 from Mon­day’s open­ing ses­sion and fired three breaks over 50 in the first four frames on Tues­day to re­duce the deficit to just two.</p>
    <p>But eighth seed Wil­son moved one frame from vic­tory af­ter win­ning the 21st frame in two vis­its. He seized on a missed long red by Trump to round off vic­tory in style with a break of 104.</p>
    <p>“I think if Kyren plays like that he will be very tough to stop. His long pot­ting was bril­liant over all three ses­sions and he is my pick to go on and win the ti­tle,” Trump said of his fel­low English­man.</p>
    <p>“I think it would be bril­liant for the game if I can have some­one of my own age group to com­pete against for the next 10 or 15 years.”</p>
    <p>Wil­son, 28, added: “I’m striv­ing to get there and Judd’s al­ready made it. For me to get there now I have got to beat the likes of Judd.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mark Selby ad­mit­ted he had doubted whether he would ever re­turn to the lat­ter stages at the Cru­cible af­ter com­plet­ing a 12-7 win over Aus­tralia’s Neil Robert­son to book his place in the semi-fi­nals for the sixth time. He suf­fered a cri­sis of con­fi­dence in the wake of his third world ti­tle win in 2017, los­ing his world No. 1 rank­ing as he won just two tour­na­ments in the fol­low­ing two years.</p>
    <p>But the 37-year-old be­lieves the man­ner of his win over fel­low for­mer cham­pion Robert­son in­di­cates he is back to some­where ap­proach­ing his best.</p>
    <p>“Over the last 12 to 18 months I was ques­tion­ing my­self. I had got so used to win­ning tour­na­ments then when I wasn’t win­ning tour­na­ments it be­came very dam­ag­ing to my con­fi­dence,” Selby said.</p>
    <p>“I was happy with my per­for­mance against Neil. I felt if I got a chance I could score, and my safety play was back up with how it was a few years ago.”</p>
    <p>Five-time cham­pion Ron­nie O’Sul­li­van won the last four frames of the ses­sion to haul level with Mark Wil­liams at 8-8, and main­tained the up­per hand to pre­vail 13-10 in the evening ses­sion.</p>
    <p>His re­ward is a semi-fi­nal date with Selby, a re­peat of the 2014 fi­nal, start­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Scot­land’s An­thony McGill beat Nor­we­gian Kurt Maflin 13-10 to set up a last-four meet­ing with Wil­son.</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING UP WITH HIS PEERS</p>
    <p>I think it would be bril­liant for the game if I can have some­one of my own age group to com­pete against for the next 10 or 15 years.’’</p>
