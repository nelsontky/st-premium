    <p>More de­tails and pho­tos have emerged from the in­ci­dent of a fall­ing ven­ti­la­tion duct in a cin­ema hall at Nex mall that saw two women taken to hos­pi­tal for their in­juries.</p>
    <p>Nine­teen-year-old Se­bas­tian Koo was watch­ing the movie Tenet in cin­ema Hall 6 with his four male friends on Sun­day when he heard a strange crum­bling noise com­ing from the ceil­ing at around 4.30pm.</p>
    <p>“It was in the mid­dle of an in­tense fight scene, so I thought it was just an ex­tremely re­al­is­tic sound ef­fect,” said the full-time na­tional ser­vice­man.</p>
    <p>But dust be­gan to fall from the ceil­ing as it cracked open and, with­out warn­ing, the ven­ti­la­tion duct came fall­ing down about two rows be­hind him, bring­ing plaster de­bris from the ceil­ing along with it.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, the ven­ti­la­tion duct, which was large enough to cover at least four seats, did not hit any­one, he noted.</p>
    <p>Though he nar­rowly avoided the de­bris by swiftly duck­ing down and cov­er­ing his neck, he was alarmed to see that a large chunk of plaster de­bris had struck a woman’s head.</p>
    <p>She was seated just one row be­hind him.</p>
    <p>Mr Koo, who is trained in first aid, im­me­di­ately tended to the woman.</p>
    <p>“She was ly­ing in a foetal po­si­tion and clutch­ing her head, but I don’t think I saw any bleed­ing and she was con­scious,” he said, adding that she was soon able to sit up.</p>
    <p>“I asked if she was okay and she was able to re­spond to my ques­tions, though she com­plained that her head was very painful.”</p>
    <p>The woman was one of two vic­tims taken to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal (TTSH) for their in­juries.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands she is likely to have suf­fered in­ter­nal head in­juries, while the other vic­tim, also fe­male, suf­fered mi­nor bruises and has been dis­charged.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for TTSH de­clined to re­spond to queries on the pa­tients’ con­di­tions and the sever­ity of their in­juries, cit­ing pa­tient con­fi­den­tial­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Koo said that although two of his friends suf­fered mi­nor scrapes from the de­bris hit­ting their heads, they were all able to quickly “snap out of it” and re­act to the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>One of them called the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF), while the other two helped to evac­u­ate peo­ple from the cin­ema hall and checked that no one was trapped un­der­neath the de­bris.</p>
    <p>“It was in­stinc­tive for me to quickly snap out of my state of shock and make sure that ev­ery­one was okay,” Mr Koo said.</p>
    <p>All the cin­ema halls were later evac­u­ated, with staff not­ing down the names and con­tact de­tails of pa­trons, for the pur­pose of giv­ing them re­funds for their tick­ets.</p>
    <p>Shaw Theatres said in an up­dated state­ment yes­ter­day that it is the com­pany’s “pri­or­ity to pro­vide sup­port to the in­jured pa­trons and their fam­i­lies”, adding that it is in con­tact with one fam­ily and has reached out to the other.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand that there were a num­ber of pa­trons who as­sisted our staff un­til the ar­rival of the SCDF and we would like to of­fer our ap­pre­ci­a­tion to them for their kind as­sis­tance,” it said. “We would like to apol­o­gise to all our pa­trons for any in­con­ve­nience and the in­ter­rup­tion of their movie ex­pe­ri­ence caused by this in­ci­dent.”</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that the Nex build­ing is co-owned by Gold Ridge and Mer­ca­tus. A Nex spokesman said its man­age­ment is un­able to share more in­for­ma­tion and that it is still work­ing with the au­thor­i­ties and Shaw Theatres on the in­ci­dent.</p>
