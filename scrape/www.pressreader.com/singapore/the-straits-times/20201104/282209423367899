    <p>Te­masek Foun­da­tion has in­vested in the ef­fort to de­velop a Covid-19 vac­cine, said Te­masek In­ter­na­tional ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive Dil­han Pil­lay San­drasegara yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said this in re­sponse to a ques­tion on Te­masek’s role in help­ing to pro­cure and dis­trib­ute the vac­cine, dur­ing a dis­cus­sion at the Te­masek Trust Con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Trust is the phil­an­thropic arm of Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment firm Te­masek.</p>
    <p>Mr Pil­lay said the foun­da­tion had in­vested in an en­tity con­sid­ered to be a leader in the quest to de­velop an ef­fec­tive vac­cine, but added that the re­spon­si­bil­ity for en­sur­ing that suf­fi­cient vac­cines are avail­able is that of the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion will pro­vide what­ever help it can through its net­work and re­la­tion­ships as it is a col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­fort, he added.</p>
    <p>Te­masek has sup­ported its foun­da­tion and part­ners in di­ag­no­sis, con­tain­ment and con­tact trac­ing, treat­ment, pro­tec­tion and pre­ven­tion, and en­able­ment, which en­tails the do­na­tion of key sup­plies such as masks, test kits and ven­ti­la­tors to about 35 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Re­ports have also said Te­masek is among the in­vestors who have in­jected US$250 mil­lion (S$340 mil­lion) through pri­vate place­ment in Ger­man biotech firm BioN­Tech, which is de­vel­op­ing a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Lo­cally, Te­masek has dis­trib­uted 11 mil­lion masks to Sin­ga­porean res­i­dents and one mil­lion face shields to young school­child­ren and front­line work­ers in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try, while 250,000 oxime­ters were do­nated to var­i­ous groups in the com­mu­nity.</p>
