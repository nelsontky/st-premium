    <p>Aim­ing to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus ahead of an all-im­por­tant col­lege en­trance exam, South Korea will tighten anti-virus mea­sures from to­day for two weeks. Mea­sures in­clude clos­ing of clubs and bars, a ban on dine-in ser­vices at cafes, and a 20 per cent seat­ing cap at re­li­gious events.</p>
    <p>This comes as the coun­try re­ported 271 new cases yes­ter­day, the first time in six days that the daily fig­ure has gone be­low 300.</p>
    <p>The to­tal tally has risen to 31,004, with 509 deaths so far.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Vice-Health Min­is­ter Kang Do-tae warned that the third wave of the pan­demic is al­ready un­der way, and it is harder to con­tain as the virus is spread­ing silently at small so­cial gath­er­ings where people tend to take off masks, and not due to big gath­er­ings like in the two pre­vi­ous waves.</p>
    <p>“Anti-virus mea­sures and med­i­cal ef­forts would not be sus­tain­able if we fail to break the chain of in­fec­tions,” he said yes­ter­day, not­ing that over 2,000 cases were reg­is­tered in the past week.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s tally in­cludes the high­est daily fig­ure in the mil­i­tary, with 33 new cases re­ported, out of whom 26 were traced to a clus­ter out­break in an army unit in the bor­der town of Che­o­r­won.</p>
    <p>Thirty-seven of the unit’s 200 mem­bers have been in­fected, with the rest wait­ing for test re­sults.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions in the mil­i­tary have been grow­ing since the mid­dle of the month, reach­ing 263 to date. More than 3,500 mil­i­tary per­son­nel are un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the gov­ern­ment an­nounced it will raise the so­cial dis</p>
    <p>tanc­ing level to the third in a fivetier sys­tem in Seoul and greater Seoul (in­clud­ing Gyeonggi province and In­cheon city) from to­day.</p>
    <p>Un­der Level 2 so­cial dis­tanc­ing, up from yes­ter­day’s Level 1.5, meet­ings and events with more than 100 people will be pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>Five types of ma­jor en­ter­tain­ment fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing clubs and bars, will close, while karaoke rooms and in­door sports fa­cil­i­ties can op­er­ate un­til 9pm. Restau­rants will have to close dine-in ser­vices at 9pm, while cafes can run only on de­liv­ery and take­out.</p>
    <p>Kinder­gartens and schools can have only one-third of their stu­dent pop­u­la­tion in school, while the rest have to learn on­line. Only high schools are al­lowed to run at two-thirds ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious events can fill only 20 per cent of seats, and the fig­ure is halved for sport­ing events.</p>
    <p>Seoul city an­nounced its own pre­emp­tive mea­sures that will re­main un­til the end of the year, such as re­duc­ing pub­lic trans­porta­tion at night and ban­ning ral­lies that in­volve 10 or more people.</p>
    <p>Pro­mo­tions to boost the lo­cal econ­omy, such as a din­ing cam­paign by the Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture and a travel coupon scheme un­der the Korea Tourism Or­gan­i­sa­tion, will also be sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Last week’s spike in cases has sparked jit­ters among high school se­niors and their par­ents.</p>
    <p>Some 490,000 stu­dents are due to sit the Col­lege Scholas­tic Abil­ity Test (CSAT) on Dec 3, an ex­am­i­na­tion so im­por­tant that work­ing</p>
    <p>hours are de­layed, flights post­poned, and po­lice cars dis­patched to help ferry late­com­ers.</p>
    <p>The exam was post­poned by two weeks from last Thursday.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Yoo Eun-hae has said CSAT is “not an easy test to post­pone again”, and the gov­ern­ment will go all out to make sure it pro­ceeds with­out any hin­drance.</p>
    <p>A two-week cam­paign was launched last Thursday to en­sure cram schools, study cafes and other fa­cil­i­ties fre­quented by high­school­ers will ad­here to strict an­tivirus mea­sures, so as to keep exam tak­ers safe from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We can’t let our guard down even the slight­est bit,” Ms Yoo said.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Vice-Health Min­is­ter Kang Do-tae warned that the third wave of the pan­demic is al­ready un­der way, and it is harder to con­tain as the virus is spread­ing silently at small so­cial gath­er­ings where people tend to take off masks, and not due to big gath­er­ings like in the two pre­vi­ous waves.</p>
