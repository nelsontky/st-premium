    <p>A Sin­ga­porean man who con­cealed $30,000 worth of drugs, some of which were dis­cov­ered in two pump­kins, was ar­rested for sus­pected drug traf­fick­ing ac­tiv­i­ties on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>About 240g of heroin, 1.5g of crys­tal metham­phetamine – also known as Ice – and 500 Ec­stasy tablets, as well as cash amount­ing to $2,276, were seized by the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB), the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>CNB of­fi­cers were ob­serv­ing the man, 64, in Cle­menti Av­enue 5 on Mon­day evening when he was seen tak­ing a bas­ket of veg­eta­bles and pro­duce up to a unit in the area.</p>
    <p>When he re­turned to the ground floor with the bas­ket, CNB of­fi­cers moved in to ar­rest him and seized from him about 0.4g of heroin, 1g of Ice and $2,276 in cash.</p>
    <p>He was then taken to his home in the same block and a search was con­ducted in the unit.</p>
    <p>Two pump­kins, one con­ceal­ing about 240g of heroin and the other 500 Ec­stasy tablets, were found.</p>
    <p>About 0.3g of heroin, 0.5g of Ice and other drug para­pher­na­lia were also found in the unit.</p>
    <p>CNB es­ti­mates that the 240g of heroin seized would be suf­fi­cient to feed the ad­dic­tion of about 114 abusers for a week.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions into the drug ac­tiv­i­ties of the sus­pect are still un­der way.</p>
