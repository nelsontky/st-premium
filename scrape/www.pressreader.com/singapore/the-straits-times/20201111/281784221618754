    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga yes­ter­day vowed all-out ef­forts to help the coun­try’s north­ern-most pre­fec­ture of Hokkaido tackle a re­cent resur­gence of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Hokkaido Gover­nor Naomichi Suzuki had vis­ited Mr Suga at his of­fice in Tokyo and briefed him on the lat­est spike in Covid-19 in­fec­tions in the pre­fec­ture.</p>
    <p>The spike is be­lieved to be re­lated to cooler tem­per­a­tures, with more peo­ple stay­ing in­doors, some­times in poorly ven­ti­lated rooms, which helps the virus to spread.</p>
    <p>Night-time en­ter­tain­ment es­tab­lish­ments have also seen clus­ters of in­fec­tions emerge, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in Hokkaido re­ported 200 new daily Covid-19 in­fec­tions on Mon­day, mark­ing the high­est level for the re­gion since the out­break of the virus in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions in Hokkaido have been in triple dig­its for four suc­ces­sive days through Sun­day, with of­fi­cials rais­ing the pan­demic alert level for the pre­fec­ture to level three on its five-tier scale.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing in­fec­tions in Hokkaido, a pop­u­lar travel des­ti­na­tion, could see it cut from the gov­ern­ment’s “Go To Travel” sub­sidy cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato has hinted that re­mov­ing Hokkaido from the do­mes­tic travel cam­paign was a pos­si­bil­ity and dis­cus­sions in this di­rec­tion were tak­ing place.</p>
    <p>Mr Suzuki told Mr Suga that Hokkaido was plan­ning to con­tain the out­break of new clus­ters and would in­crease the num­ber of beds at med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties for those in­fected and need­ing pro­fes­sional care.</p>
    <p>The gover­nor also ex­plained that in Sap­poro City, the cap­i­tal off Hokkaido, new fa­cil­i­ties will be utilised to treat 1,000 pa­tients with mi­nor</p>
    <p>symp­toms of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>If in­fec­tions con­tinue to rise and spread through­out Ja­pan’s north­ern-most pre­fec­ture, Mr Suzuki would ask the cen­tral gov­ern­ment to pro­vide as­sis­tance, as med­i­cal per­son­nel and fa­cil­i­ties would quickly be in short sup­ply.</p>
    <p>The gover­nor also said he wanted the pub­lic to be in­formed about how to pre­vent in­fec­tions dur­ing win­ter as the na­tion will also be con­tend­ing with an in­fluenza out­break, which tends to hit the coun­try each year to­wards the end of De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>At a press brief­ing af­ter his meet­ing with Prime Min­is­ter Suga, Mr Suzuki said he planned to have the new out­break of the virus un­der con­trol by the end of this month and would carry out anti-vi­ral mea­sures – in­clud­ing com­pre­hen­sive test­ing mea­sures in en­ter­tain­ment dis­tricts – with sup­port from the cen­tral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, for his part, pledged the cen­tral gov­ern­ment’s all-out ef­forts in help­ing Hokkaido com­bat the virus.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Tokyo met­ro­pol­i­tan gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day con­firmed 293 new Covid-19 cases in the Ja­panese cap­i­tal. This comes on the heels of 157 new cases on Mon­day. Tokyo, the hard­est-hit by the virus, has now seen a cu­mu­la­tive to­tal num­ber of 33,060 cases.</p>
    <p>Across Ja­pan, the to­tal num­ber of cases stands at 109,191, with 1,834 deaths, based on data com­piled by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
