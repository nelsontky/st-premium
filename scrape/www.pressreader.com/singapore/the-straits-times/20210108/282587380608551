    <p>NEW YORK • The wildly pop­u­lar Net­flix se­ries The Queen’s Gam­bit (2020) has done for chess what late celebrity chef Ju­lia Child once did for French cook­ing.</p>
    <p>Chess-set sales have sky­rock­eted and en­rol­ment in on­line chess classes has surged.</p>
    <p>The se­ries has been the sub­ject of hun­dreds of ar­ti­cles and in­ter­views. The novel that in­spired the show, first pub­lished in 1983, has been on The New York Times’ trade pa­per­back best­seller list for seven weeks.</p>
    <p>Yet, lit­tle at­ten­tion has been paid to Wal­ter Te­vis, the au­thor whose cre­ation has stirred all the com­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Te­vis once pegged him­self as “a good Amer­i­can writer of the sec­ond rank”.</p>
    <p>But Al­lan Scott, the screen­writer who first op­tioned The Queen’s Gam­bit in the 1980s, dis­agrees. Scott co-cre­ated and ex­ec­u­tive­pro­duced the Net­flix show.</p>
    <p>“I think very highly of Te­vis,” he said in an e-mail. “I think he was one of the best Amer­i­can writ­ers of the 20th cen­tury. The Queen’s Gam­bit lays out a ter­rific story very sim­ply. Child, mother killed, or­phan­age, touch of ge­nius, ad­dic­tion. It’s Dick­en­sian.”</p>
    <p>It took decades to bring the book to the screen, Scott said, be­cause stu­dios thought the sub­ject of chess was a com­mer­cial dead-end.</p>
    <p>Born in 1928, Te­vis wrote six nov­els, a sur­pris­ing num­ber of which made high-pro­file leaps to the screen: The Hustler (1961), about a young pool shark played by the late ac­tor Paul New­man; The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976), star­ring singer David Bowie as a lone­some alien; and The Colour Of Money (1986), a fol­low-up to The Hustler, which won New­man his first Os­car.</p>
    <p>Te­vis’ 1980 sci­ence-fic­tion book, Mock­ing­bird, a com­men­tary on hu­man­ity’s dwin­dling in­ter­est in read­ing, has long had a mod­est cult fol­low­ing.</p>
    <p>He was a fam­ily man who played board games and fished with his kids, a pop­u­lar pro­fes­sor of writ­ing and lit­er­a­ture at Ohio Univer­sity in Athens, a cat lover and movie afi­cionado and a tal­ented am­a­teur chess and pool player.</p>
    <p>He was pale and gan­gly. Some of his stu­dents called him “Ich­a­bod Crane”. His fic­tion of­ten plumbs his psy­che, metaphor­i­cally.</p>
    <p>“He’s the hero of all his own books,” said his son Will Te­vis, 66, be­fore cor­rect­ing him­self: “He’s the an­ti­hero.”</p>
    <p>Wal­ter Te­vis con­sid­ered his ter­rain to be the world of un­der­dogs.</p>
    <p>“I write about losers and lon­ers,” he told The New York Times in 1983. “If there’s a com­mon theme in my work, that’s it. I in­vented the phrase ‘born loser’ in The Hustler.</p>
    <p>In one way or another, I’ m ob­sessed with the strug­gle between win­ning and los­ing.”</p>
    <p>Te­vis was born in San Fran­cisco, into what he called a “feel­ing-less, up­tight” home. His par­ents moved to Ken­tucky when he was 10.</p>
    <p>Be­cause young Wal­ter had a heart con­di­tion, his par­ents left him be­hind i n a con­va­les­cent home, where he spent months drugged on phe­no­bar­bi­tal, like Beth Har­mon, the main char­ac­ter in The Queen’s Gam­bit.</p>
    <p>In an es­say pub­lished in 1990, Te­vis’ first wife, Jamie, wrote: “He never got over the scars of the early ex­pe­ri­ence with nar­cotics.”</p>
    <p>Te­vis be­lieved that early ex­pe­ri­ence fu­elled his later al­co­holism.</p>
    <p>When he left Cal­i­for­nia to re­join his fam­ily, he found his new en­vi­ron­ment be­wil­der­ing.</p>
    <p>In a 1981 in­ter­view, he said The Man Who Fell To Earth, about an alien who lands in Ken­tucky and can­not ad­just to life on this planet, was “dis­guised au­to­bi­og­ra­phy”. “It has to do with my hav­ing moved from what I thought was the city of light, San Fran­cisco, when I was 11, to Lex­ing­ton, Ken­tucky, where I went to a tough Ap­palachian school in the fifth grade and was beaten up reg­u­larly,” Te­vis said.</p>
    <p>He gave the movie ver­sion of the book a C-plus, call­ing it con­fus­ing, but when he met Bowie, he found him to be “a won­der­ful man”.</p>
    <p>The Hustler, drawn from Te­vis’ rough-and-tum­ble pool hall ex­pe­ri­ences be­fore and af­ter the war, came out in 1959, fol­lowed by The Man Who Fell To Earth in 1963.</p>
    <p>Then Te­vis pub­lished al­most noth­ing un­til 1980. He and his wife, whom he met when they taught at the same high school, raised two chil­dren while he was at Ohio Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He played chess and shot pool, of­ten with his col­league Daniel Keyes, who wrote Flow­ers For Al­ger­non.</p>
    <p>Te­vis drank heav­ily and his mar­riage suf­fered. Even so, his chil­dren re­mem­ber Te­vis as a de­voted par­ent.</p>
    <p>His daugh­ter Ju­lia McGory, 63, said his kids had ex­pe­ri­enced some of “the sad­ness and com­plex­i­ties of our fa­ther”, but “never doubted how much he loved us and en­joyed be­ing with us”.</p>
    <p>In the mid-1970s, Te­vis sobered up, partly with help from Al­co­holics Anony­mous. Deeply frus­trated by his writer’s block, he got a di­vorce and de­cided to try his cre­ative luck in Man­hat­tan.</p>
    <p>He be­gan a re­la­tion­ship with, and even­tu­ally mar­ried, Ms Eleanora Walker, who worked for his agent.</p>
    <p>Te­vis also re­gained his writerly mojo, fin­ish­ing four more nov­els and a col­lec­tion of short sto­ries.</p>
    <p>He helped con­vince New­man to star in the movie ver­sion of The Colour Of Money. He also wrote The Queen’s Gam­bit dur­ing those years. Writer To­bias Wolff called it an “over­looked mas­ter­piece”.</p>
    <p>In a 1981 in­ter­view, Te­vis said he had re­alised in mid­dle age that “life is worth living”.</p>
    <p>He hoped to write one book a year for the rest of his life.</p>
    <p>Three years later, he died of lung cancer at 56.</p>
    <p>Te­vis’ pub­lish­ing ca­reer may not be over. His es­tate holds two un­pub­lished chil­dren’s books, said Ms Su­san Schul­man, the agent who rep­re­sents it.</p>
    <p>Gang­ster Cat is the story of a New York City cat and his gang. Turnip Is­land is the story of a fam­ily who live on an is­land of noth­ing but mud. “They are com­pletely de­light­ful,” Ms Schul­man said.</p>
    <p>If he were still alive, Will Te­vis said, his fa­ther would be “bask­ing in glory right now. He had de­sires for the spot­light. He wanted to be known and no­ticed”.</p>
