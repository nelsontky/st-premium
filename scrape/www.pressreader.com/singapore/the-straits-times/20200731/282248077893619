    <p>MIL­WAU­KEE BUCKS (53-12)</p>
    <p>Out­look: The Bucks were the dom­i­nant team be­fore the sus­pen­sion, lead­ing the Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) in point dif­fer­en­tial at 11.2, against 7.4 for the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers. And they had the league’s best de­fence and the third-best of­fence. The East­ern Con­fer­ence leaders also have Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo, who will likely re­peat as the Most Valu­able Player, and ef­fi­cient Khris Mid­dle­ton as his wing­man. They are ti­tle favourites, bol­stered by likely first-round op­po­nents (Brook­lyn Nets or Wash­ing­ton Wizards) who are weak­ened with­out their best play­ers.</p>
    <p>Chal­lenge: Mid­dle­ton said he did not pick up a basketball for sev­eral months dur­ing quar­an­tine. And can An­te­tok­oun­mpo, who is not a strong three-point shooter, over­come de­fences that load up the paint on him in the play-offs?</p>
    <p>TORONTO RAP­TORS (46-18)</p>
    <p>Out­look: The de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons are deep. Pas­cal Si­akam broke out this year to av­er­age ca­reer highs in al­most ev­ery cat­e­gory and es­tab­lish him­self as a star, which helped the team over­come the loss of Kawhi Leonard. Aside from Si­akam, five other play­ers – Kyle Lowry, Fred Van­Vleet, Nor­man Powell, Serge Ibaka and O.G. Anunoby – av­er­aged dou­ble dig­its in scor­ing for Toronto. They ex­celled de­fen­sively, sec­ond best be­hind Mil­wau­kee. Chal­lenge: Can they hold off the Bos­ton Celtics, who are three games be­hind, to re­tain their sec­ond seed? The dif­fer­ence be­tween the No. 2 seed and the No. 3 is fac­ing a de­pleted Nets team and go­ing up against Mi­ami, In­di­ana or Philadel­phia, who might land at No. 6.</p>
    <p>BOS­TON CELTICS (43-21)</p>
    <p>Out­look: Of their big four – Kemba Walker, Jayson Ta­tum, Jaylen Brown and Gor­don Hay­ward – only Hay­ward is not av­er­ag­ing at least 20 points a game. They have also re­ceived some heady con­tri­bu­tions from rookie Grant Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>Chal­lenge: What’s the sta­tus of Walker’s knee? He missed sev­eral games dur­ing the reg­u­lar sea­son, and after the long lay-off, coach Brad Stevens sug­gested that Walker needed more time to ease into play.</p>
    <p>OK­LA­HOMA CITY THUN­DER (40-24)</p>
    <p>Out­look: When the Thun­der traded Rus­sell West­brook to the Hous­ton Rock­ets and Paul Ge­orge to the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers, most fig­ured that Chris Paul, who they ac­quired in their deal with Hous­ton, would land with an­other team. In­stead, he ded­i­cated him­self to the Thun­der – fifth in the West­ern Con­fer­ence – and even made the All­Star team again. The pay-off has been huge, as he helped nur­ture play­ers like guard Shai Gil­geousAlexa­n­der, 22. Chal­lenge: Do they have enough pieces? Den­nis Schroder, one of the league’s top re­serves, has said that he will leave the bub­ble when his wife gives birth to their sec­ond child. She is due next month.</p>
    <p>HOUS­TON ROCK­ETS (40-24)</p>
    <p>Out­look: The mad sci­en­tists of the NBA are set to con­tinue with an­other bold ex­per­i­ment: The small­ball line-up they de­ployed in Fe­bru­ary. The idea is to sta­tion five play­ers on the perime­ter so that they drag their de­fend­ers to the three-point line and give West­brook seams to drive to the hoop.</p>
    <p>Chal­lenge: James Har­den is hav­ing an­other big sea­son, scor­ing a league-lead­ing 34.4 points a game, and West­brook’s pro­duc­tion im­proved after coach Mike D’An­toni went small. But will the Rock­ets, level with the Thun­der in the West, be able to de­fend in the post-sea­son? NY­TIMES</p>
