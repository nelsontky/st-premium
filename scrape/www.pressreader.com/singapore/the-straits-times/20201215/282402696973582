    <p>PARIS • Barcelona will face Paris Saint-Ger­main and for­mer striker Ney­mar while ti­tle-hold­ers Bay­ern Mu­nich are up against Lazio in the last 16 of the Cham­pi­ons League af­ter the draw was held yesterday.</p>
    <p>The prize clash as the knock­out phase be­gins will be a re­peat of the re­mark­able Barca-PSG meet­ing at the same stage in 2017.</p>
    <p>The Cata­lan giants over­came a 4-0 first-leg loss to beat the French cham­pi­ons 6-1 at the Nou Camp with Ney­mar scor­ing twice for the La Liga side.</p>
    <p>“We know them (PSG) well, they’ve got some ex­cep­tional play­ers. Paris want to fight for the Cham­pi­ons League. Last year, they came very close to win­ning it (los­ing in the fi­nal) and they want to go one bet­ter this time, but we’ve got some­thing to say about that,” said Guillermo Amor, Barca’s direc­tor of in­sti­tu­tional re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern will start as favourites in their tie but will be wary of Si­mone In­za­ghi’s side, who have reached the knock­out phase for the first time in 20 years.</p>
    <p>“Lazio are an un­com­fort­able op­po­nent, you saw that in the group,” said Bay­ern sports direc­tor Hasan Sal­i­hamidzic. “It is al­ways un­com­fort­able against Ital­ian teams.”</p>
    <p>Premier League cham­pi­ons Liver­pool will play last year’s semi-fi­nal­ists RB Leipzig.</p>
    <p>The match-up pits Ger­many’s most highly-rated young coach Ju­lian Nagels­mann, 33, against Liver­pool coun­ter­part Jurgen Klopp, 53.</p>
    <p>The Reds are un­beaten in their last 10 matches against Ger­man teams in all Euro­pean com­pe­ti­tions, a run go­ing back to 2002.</p>
    <p>There will also be a re­union for Naby Keita, who will be re­turn­ing to the Red Bull Arena he left to join the Reds in 2018. Both sides have never played each other, but Leipzig are look­ing for­ward to the tie, with the club’s Twit­ter ac­count writing: “Look­ing for­ward to wel­com­ing you back to the RB Arena, Naby!”</p>
    <p>There will be an­other re­union of sorts as Atletico Madrid will take on Chelsea in a game which could see Spain striker Diego Costa re­turn to Stam­ford Bridge for the first time since de­part­ing in 2018.</p>
    <p>Real Madrid, the record 13-time Euro­pean Cup win­ners, face Ata­lanta, who reached the quar­ter-fi­nals in their maiden Cham­pi­ons League cam­paign last sea­son.</p>
    <p>But the Ital­ians have their work cut out as Zine­dine Zi­dane’s men have won 10 of their last 11 games against Serie A teams. Tak­ing a leaf out of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s book, Ata­lanta mid­fielder Marten de Roon joked to “stop the count” af­ter Uefa put up a poll – that showed Ata­lanta lead­ing by one vote – on who fans thought would be the like­lier vic­tors.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester City take on Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach, in the last 16 for the first time in the Cham­pi­ons League, while Ital­ian cham­pi­ons Ju­ven­tus play Porto.</p>
    <p>The two-legged ties will com­mence from Feb 16.</p>
    <p>For the Europa League, both Manch­ester United, who joins the com­pe­ti­tion af­ter their loss to Leipzig last week, and Arse­nal were handed tough draws.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils face cur­rent Span­ish league lead­ers Real So­ciedad and the strug­gling Gun­ners have to con­tend with Ben­fica.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham got the luck of the draw af­ter be­ing pit­ted against Aus­trian min­nows Wolfs­berger, while Le­ices­ter will face Czech side Slavia Prague up next in the last 32.</p>
