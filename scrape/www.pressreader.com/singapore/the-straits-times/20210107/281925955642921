    <p>The of­fice of the US direc­tor of na­tional in­tel­li­gence has said it is likely Rus­sia was be­hind a string of hacks iden­ti­fied last month that gained ac­cess to sev­eral fed­eral agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The of­fice – along with the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Agency and the Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity’s Cy­ber-se­cu­rity and In­fra­struc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency – said in a joint state­ment on Tues­day that the hack­ers’ goal ap­peared to be col­lect­ing data, rather than any de­struc­tive acts. They said they had so far iden­ti­fied “fewer than 10” agen­cies that were hacked.</p>
    <p>The agen­cies said that the ac­tor, “likely Russian in ori­gin, was re­spon­si­ble for most or all of the re­cently dis­cov­ered, on­go­ing cy­ber com­pro­mises of both gov­ern­ment and non-gov­ern­men­tal net­works”.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion is con­tin­u­ing, they said, and could turn up ad­di­tional gov­ern­ment vic­tims.</p>
    <p>It was the first for­mal state­ment of at­tri­bu­tion by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Elected of­fi­cials briefed on the in­quiry and Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo had pre­vi­ously said Rus­sia was be­hind the hack­ing spree, but Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said it could have been China.</p>
    <p>The in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion of Demo­crat Joe Bi­den has al­ready promised a re­sponse to the So­larWinds hacks. And on Tues­day, the top Democrats on the con­gres­sional in­tel­li­gence com­mit­tees un­der­scored that need.</p>
    <p>“Congress will need to con­duct a com­pre­hen­sive re­view of the cir­cum­stances lead­ing to this com­pro­mise, as­sess the de­fi­cien­cies in our de­fences, take stock of the suf­fi­ciency of our re­sponse in or­der to pre­vent this from hap­pen­ing again, and en­sure we re­spond ap­pro­pri­ately,” said Mr Adam Schiff, head of the House com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Russian of­fi­cials have de­nied in­volve­ment and did not re­spond to ques­tions on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The pen­e­tra­tion of de­part­ments in­clud­ing De­fence, State, Home­land Se­cu­rity, Trea­sury and Com­merce is al­ready con­sid­ered the worst known cy­ber com­pro­mise at least since elec­tronic dossiers on most Amer­i­cans with se­cu­rity clear­ances were taken from the Of­fice of Per­son­nel Man­age­ment five years ago.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials briefed on the case said the main tar­get of the hack­ers ap­peared to be e-mail. One of­fi­cial said no clas­si­fied net­works seem to have been breached and that fewer than 50 pri­vate com­pa­nies had been fully com­pro­mised, a lower num­ber than ini­tially feared.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity com­pany FireEye, which was it­self breached, dis­cov­ered the new round of at­tacks, many of them traced to a tainted soft­ware up­date from So­larWinds, which makes widely used net­work-man­age­ment pro­grams.</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­known how the hack­ers got deep i nside So­larWinds’ pro­duc­tion sys­tem as long as a year ago. Once in, they were able to slip “back doors” into two dig­i­tally signed up­dates of the com­pany’s flag­ship Orion soft­ware.</p>
    <p>As many as 18,000 cus­tomers down­loaded those up­dates, which sent sig­nals back to the hack­ers. At a small num­ber of high-value tar­gets, the group then ma­nip­u­lated ac­cess to cloud ser­vices in or­der to read e-mail mes­sages or other con­tent and po­ten­tially in­stalled other back doors, mak­ing clean-up af­ter dis­cov­ery a daunt­ing task.</p>
    <p>A few ma­jor tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies have said they had at least down­loaded the bad code from So­larWinds, and Mi­crosoft said on Dec 31 that the pen­e­tra­tion had gone well be­yond that, al­low­ing the in­trud­ers to view its prized source code, where they might have looked for se­cu­rity flaws.</p>
    <p>The at­tack­ers also hacked sell­ers of Mi­crosoft ser­vices, which of­ten main­tain ac­cess to cus­tomers, to go af­ter e-mail at non-So­larWinds cus­tomers, ac­cord­ing to se­cu­rity com­pany CrowdStrik­e Hold­ing and Mi­crosoft em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft and fed­eral in­ves­ti­ga­tors have not said how many re­sellers were hacked or how many cus­tomers were af­fected.</p>
    <p>The over­all strat­egy of elec­tronic in­fil­tra­tion through ven­dors, known as a sup­ply-chain at­tack, is es­pe­cially ef­fec­tive, and of­fi­cials fear that the suc­cess of the cur­rent wave will en­cour­age more of such acts.</p>
