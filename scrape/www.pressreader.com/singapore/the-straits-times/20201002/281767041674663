    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) re­moved two com­mu­nity cases it had an­nounced ear­lier yes­ter­day, af­ter fur­ther tests con­firmed the in­di­vid­u­als did not have Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial tests showed they were bor­der­line-pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>In an up­date last night, the min­istry re­vised the num­ber of com­mu­nity cases from three to one. The sole case is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Among the 15 im­ported cases re­ported yes­ter­day were four spe­cial pass hold­ers who are crew mem­bers of a ship that ar­rived from Malaysia on Sept 23.</p>
    <p>They did not disem­bark, and were sub­se­quently sent to a hospi­tal af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 while on board.</p>
    <p>The other im­ported cases counted three Sin­ga­pore­ans and two per­ma­nent res­i­dents among them, with the oth­ers be­ing longterm pass hold­ers, and one on a short-term visit pass.</p>
    <p>Eight ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia be­tween Sept 17 and Sept 28, in­clud­ing two Sin­ga­pore­ans. The third Sin­ga­porean re­turned from In­done­sia on Sept 19. The re­main­ing two im­ported cases came from France and the Philippine­s.</p>
    <p>MOH con­firmed 19 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,784.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Junc­tion Nine in Yishun and the Orchis Food Court at Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 1 were among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides a list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health. Close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places, which would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing three pa­tients.</p>
    <p>One was iden­ti­fied ear­lier as a con­tact of pre­vi­ous cases, and had been quar­an­tined to prevent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. He was tested dur­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The other two were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 24 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,497 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Forty-four pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 201 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day in the same pe­riod.</p>
