    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The top two United States eco­nomic pol­i­cy­mak­ers have parted ways over whether to pre­serve emer­gency lend­ing fa­cil­i­ties de­signed to shore up the econ­omy – a rare mo­ment of dis­cord as the na­tion con­fronts the risk of a re­newed down­turn spurred by a surge in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The dis­agree­ment erupted late on Thurs­day, touched off when out­go­ing Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin re­leased a let­ter to Fed­eral Re­serve chair Jerome Pow­ell call­ing for the re­turn of fund­ing for sev­eral Fed lend­ing pro­grammes that rely on the Trea­sury’s back­ing.</p>
    <p>Min­utes later, the cen­tral bank is­sued its own state­ment urg­ing that “the full suite” of fa­cil­i­ties be kept in place.</p>
    <p>In­vestor re­ac­tion to the split was swift: Fu­tures on the S&P 500 In­dex slumped 0.9 per cent in early trad­ing yes­ter­day in Asia, with haven de­mand send­ing Trea­suries higher and pulling down yields.</p>
    <p>Trea­sury chiefs and Fed chairs typ­i­cally co­or­di­nate closely in times of cri­sis, ap­pear­ing jointly be­fore Congress and work­ing in lock­step to en­sure fund­ing mar­kets run smoothly.</p>
    <p>The two agen­cies were tightly linked in the bailouts of the fi­nan­cial and auto in­dus­tries more than a decade ago. And they be­came tied statu­to­rily in the Cares Act eco­nomic res­cue pack­age in March that ap­pro­pri­ated money for the Trea­sury to sup­port Fed back­stops for every­thing from mu­nic­i­pal to cor­po­rate fi­nance.</p>
    <p>“This is a sig­nif­i­cant and dis­turb­ing breach at a crit­i­cal time for the econ­omy,” said Mr Tony Fratto, who worked at the Trea­sury De­part­ment dur­ing the Ge­orge W. Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“We need all the arms of gov­ern­ment work­ing to­gether and in­stead we’re see­ing a com­plete break­down.”</p>
    <p>He noted that Wash­ing­ton re­mains at an im­passe on fis­cal stim­u­lus as well.</p>
    <p>Un­der­scor­ing the suc­cess of the pro­grammes the Fed es­tab­lished, Mr Mnuchin ar­gued that some can be al­lowed to stop buy­ing new as­sets at the end of next month. He asked that oth­ers be kept in place for an ad­di­tional 90 days.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cial con­di­tions are quite strong,” Mr Mnuchin said in an in­ter­view. “The good news is, the mar­kets have re­cov­ered sig­nif­i­cantly.”</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies do not need more loans and in­stead re­quire more grant money, which re­quires ac­tion from Congress, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Mnuchin said that the pur­pose of his an­nounce­ment was not to pit the Trea­sury against the Fed, and that he was merely car­ry­ing out the law pre­scribed by the Cares Act. The fa­cil­i­ties could be re­ac­ti­vated, if needed, with con­gres­sional sup­port or with other funds avail­able to the Trea­sury, he said.</p>
    <p>“It ap­pears the Fed may be read­ing the leg­is­la­tion dif­fer­ently”, given its state­ment on Thurs­day evening, said Mr Michael Feroli, chief US econ­o­mist at JPMor­gan Chase & Co.</p>
    <p>The risk is that the dis­cord be­tween the key eco­nomic play­ers un­der­mines con­fi­dence at a time when growth is flag­ging.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Re­serve Bank of Dal­las pres­i­dent Robert Ka­plan said on Bloomberg TV on Thurs­day that there is the po­ten­tial for gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) to shrink this quar­ter and even the next.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is also set to go with­out fis­cal stim­u­lus: Repub­li­cans and Democrats re­main dead­locked on a new pack­age, and mea­sures – in­clud­ing ex­tended unem­ploy­ment ben­e­fits – are set to ex­pire next month.</p>
    <p>“I was a bit sur­prised,” said Fed­eral Re­serve Bank of At­lanta pres­i­dent Raphael Bos­tic about the Trea­sury’s state­ment, in a Bloomberg TV in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“Given where the econ­omy is – and there’s so much un­cer­tainty still out there – it’s pru­dent to keep those things open so that when peo­ple, if they do have stress, they can draw upon it.”</p>
    <p>Among the ini­tia­tives that will no longer be able to ex­tend new credit are two fa­cil­i­ties that al­lowed the Fed to buy cor­po­rate bonds for the first time. They helped to un­freeze that mar­ket even be­fore the ef­fort was up and run­ning, and busi­nesses have since logged record amounts of debt is­suance.</p>
    <p>An­other, the Main Street Lend­ing Pro­gramme, has had a slow start, and the Fed re­cently loos­ened its terms to en­cour­age banks and smaller busi­nesses to par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>Mr Pow­ell him­self said at a vir­tual con­fer­ence on Tues­day that the time to dis­con­tinue the lend­ing fa­cil­i­ties was “not soon”, high­light­ing that the cen­tral bank typ­i­cally keeps its back­stops in place for some time af­ter a cri­sis hits.</p>
    <p>He has re­peat­edly praised the Cares Act for what he has de­scribed as es­sen­tial sup­port amid the his­toric col­lapse in GDP in the spring.</p>
    <p>The US Cham­ber of Com­merce called for a re­con­sid­er­a­tion of Mr Mnuchin’s de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“We strongly urge these pro­grammes be ex­tended for the fore­see­able fu­ture and call on Congress to pass ad­di­tional pan­demic re­lief tar­geted at the Amer­i­can busi­nesses, work­ers and in­dus­tries that con­tinue to suf­fer,” the cham­ber said in a state­ment.</p>
