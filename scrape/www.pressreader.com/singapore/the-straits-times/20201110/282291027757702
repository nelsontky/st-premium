    <p>For Sin­ga­pore-based con­tract man­u­fac­turer Wat­son EP In­dus­tries, a Joe Bi­den pres­i­den­tial vic­tory is a “ray of hope in the time of Covid-19” as the pres­sure has eased on it hav­ing to move its au­dio speaker pro­duc­tion for the United States mar­ket out of China.</p>
    <p>Al­ready hit by high tar­iffs from the US-China trade war, its US clients had con­sid­ered mov­ing pro­duc­tion to avoid hav­ing to keep pay­ing tar­iffs as pan­demic-in­duced lock­downs took their toll on global de­mand for au­dio speak­ers at con­certs and events.</p>
    <p>Even though tar­iffs on the firm’s ex­ports from its fac­tory in China to the US had been cut to 7.5 per cent from 15 per cent last year, Wat­son ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Joyce Seow said: “We kept our mitigation plan in place be­cause (Don­ald) Trump is so er­ratic.”</p>
    <p>She added: “We have to wait for Bi­den to get into his role first. Hope­fully in two to three months, there will be more clar­ity on Bi­den’s ap­proach to global trade.”</p>
    <p>Hopes of a de-es­ca­la­tion of geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions un­der the Pres­i­dent-elect’s ad­min­is­tra­tion and a pos­si­ble re­duc­tion or roll­back of tar­iffs an­i­mated the rally in stock mar­kets glob­ally and in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Across Asia, most mar­kets started the week on a pos­i­tive note, led by Ja­pan, Shen­zhen and Thai­land. All three mar­kets posted a gain of around 2.1 per cent each. Hong Kong, Tai­wan and Sin­ga­pore each closed 1.2 per cent higher.</p>
    <p>US stock fu­tures were al­ready sharply higher ear­lier yes­ter­day with the un­cer­tainty of the elec­tion out of the way. But they surged 5.87 per cent (as at 10.20 pm last night in Sin­ga­pore) af­ter Pfizer said its Covid-19 vac­cine was 90 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect to see a de-es­ca­la­tion of trade ten­sions, as Bi­den crit­i­cised how the US econ­omy has suf­fered from the trade war,” said Mr Daniel Ger­ard, se­nior multi-as­set strate­gist at State Street Global Mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“Even though we don’t ex­pect the tar­iffs to be rolled back im­me­di­ately, more con­struc­tive trade talks could bridge gaps in ne­go­ti­a­tions, help­ing re­move risk for fi­nan</p>
    <p>cial mar­kets. Asia will be a strong ben­e­fi­ciary... due to its rel­a­tively bet­ter han­dling of the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, there has been bi­par­ti­san sup­port and con­sen­sus in the US about con­tain­ing China on mul­ti­ple fronts be­yond trade, tech­nol­ogy and national se­cu­rity is­sues, Mr Ho Meng Kit, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion, noted.</p>
    <p>“A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion is likely to sug­gest a more mea­sured ap­proach to­wards US-China re­la­tions. It will be less pugilis­tic and more nu­anced, re­ly­ing on al­liances with part­ners, mul­ti­lat­eral frame</p>
    <p>works and in­sti­tu­tions, such as the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) and World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Even as there are hopes that the US may rejoin the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP), which would be ben­e­fi­cial to Sin­ga­pore and other mem­bers of the trade pact as the US mar­ket rep­re­sents 60 per cent of the TPP’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, ob­servers say trade may not be the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion’s top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>“The con­cerns in the im­me­di­ate term are man­ag­ing Covid-19, US eco­nomic re­cov­ery, and cli­mate change,” Mr Ho said.</p>
    <p>“While the sta­tus of the US’ re­turn to TPP is un­cer­tain now, what we hope... is the US re­turn­ing to in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions, like WTO, to play a piv­otal role in dis­cussing and man­ag­ing trade. This sup­port for a mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem is crit­i­cal to an ex­port-ori­ented econ­omy like Sin­ga­pore’s,” he added.</p>
    <p>Many are ex­pect­ing the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to re­store trade al­liances and to pur­sue mul­ti­lat­eral rather than bi­lat­eral trade deals, May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin said.</p>
    <p>“There may likely be fewer charges of cur­rency ma­nip­u­la­tion or un­der­val­u­a­tion, and less pre­oc­cu­pa­tion with the size of cer­tain coun­tries’ bi­lat­eral cur­rent ac­count sur­plus with the US.”</p>
    <p>Mar­kets will likely no longer be on ten­ter­hooks from tweet-led pol­i­cy­mak­ing, ob­servers say. “This is a re­lief rally af­ter four years of Trump,” CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun said.</p>
    <p>“The mar­kets seem to think there are blue skies ahead even though it is still cloudy,” he noted, and warned, “we shouldn’t ex­pect the be­gin­ning of a re­set in pol­icy be­cause the US elec­tion re­sults show a very di­vided coun­try, so mak­ing pol­icy changes isn’t go­ing to be easy. In fact, the pol­icy paral­y­sis we saw in Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s sec­ond term is a real pos­si­bil­ity dur­ing Bi­den’s term, given a di­vided Congress”.</p>
