    <p>More than 300 chil­dren in In­done­sia, in­clud­ing new­borns and those un­der the age of six, are be­lieved to have died of Covid-19, a phe­nom­e­non that could see the coun­try hav­ing the world’s high­est rate of child deaths from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This is the gloomy fore­cast of the In­done­sian Pae­di­atric So­ci­ety (IDAI), which re­ported 51 child deaths since March 17 out of the 2,712 con­firmed Covid-19 cases among chil­dren as of Mon­day.</p>
    <p>It fur­ther pointed out that an­other 290 out of 7,633 young chil­dren sus­pected to have the dis­ease might have died from the virus.</p>
    <p>IDAI’s chair­man, Dr Aman Bhakti Pu­lun­gan, said on Thurs­day that In­done­sia has “recorded the great­est num­ber of child deaths (from the virus) in Asean, and even Asia”.</p>
    <p>“As the pan­demic is not yet over, In­done­sia will likely have the high­est rate of child deaths from Covid-19 in the world,” he added, not­ing that no such deaths have been re­ported in neigh­bour­ing Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian health of­fi­cials blame the high num­ber of child deaths from the virus, which mostly kills the el­derly, on the chil­dren’s un­der­ly­ing health con­di­tions, such as mal­nu­tri­tion, and poor health fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>IDAI said that 45 chil­dren who died of Covid-19 had con­di­tions such as cen­tral ner­vous sys­tem in­fec­tion, tu­ber­cu­lo­sis, gas­troin­testi­nal in­fec­tion, acute mal­nu­tri­tion and dengue haem­or­rhagic fever.</p>
    <p>Dr Aman added that late di­ag­no­sis and treat­ment caused the death of most of the chil­dren be­low age six. “There were a lot of chil­dren who re­ceived treat­ment less than 24 hours, 36 hours or 48 hours be­fore they died,” he added. “Some were di­ag­nosed only af­ter they had died.”</p>
    <p>A 40-day-old baby in Pamekasan, East Java, died of Covid-19 on June 21 af­ter al­legedly con­tract­ing the virus from neigh­bours who vis­ited the fam­ily a few weeks ear­lier.</p>
    <p>A nine-month-old child also died of the dis­ease in Mataram, West Nusa Teng­gara, on May 23.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, a 15-month-old girl died in Batam on May 23, a day af­ter her mother took her to a hos­pi­tal be­cause she had fever and di­ar­rhoea. Mr Tjet­jep Yu­di­ana, who heads the provin­cial health agency of the Riau Is­lands, told The Straits Times: “She was about to be tested, but she died. She was un­der­weight, so her im­mune sys­tem was weak.”</p>
    <p>Chil­dren make up al­most one-third, or 83 mil­lion, of In­done­sia’s pop­u­la­tion of nearly 270 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Dr Aman has sug­gested that chil­dren with symp­toms such as di­ar­rhoea and fever be tested for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Jasra Pu­tra, com­mis­sioner of the In­done­sian Child Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion, has called on the coun­try’s health au­thor­i­ties to swab the chil­dren of par­ents be­ing tested. “If their par­ents are tested, the chil­dren must also be tested.”</p>
    <p>Tests can also help the gov­ern­ment map out the sit­u­a­tion and gen­er­ate health ser­vice poli­cies in line with chil­dren’s needs, such as dis­tribut­ing vi­ta­mins to boost im­mu­nity, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Na­har, deputy for child pro­tec­tion at the Women’s Em­pow­er­ment and Child Pro­tec­tion Min­istry, said the gov­ern­ment is try­ing to in­crease test­ing. “If many more peo­ple are tested, the in­fec­tion among chil­dren can be pre­vented,” added Mr Na­har, who, like many In­done­sians, goes by one name.</p>
    <p>An­other con­cern high­lighted by Mr Jasra is that more than half of the in­fected chil­dren con­tracted the dis­ease from their par­ents.</p>
    <p>With the eas­ing of so­cial re­stric­tions in many parts of the coun­try, chances are high that more chil­dren will be in­fected. Mr Jasra said par­ents need to be ed­u­cated about health pro­to­cols, like mask wear­ing, so they do not be­come car­ri­ers and in­fect their chil­dren.</p>
