    <p>• Trop­i­cal Storm Wil­fred and Sub­trop­i­cal Storm Al­pha formed i n the eastern At­lantic Ocean on Fri­day, be­com­ing the 21st and 22nd named storms since May and ex­haust­ing this year’s list of names, with over two months left in the ac­tive hur­ri­cane sea­son.</p>
    <p>With max­i­mum sus­tained winds of 64kmh, Wil­fred was trav­el­ling at 27kmh on Fri­day about 700km west south-west of the Cabo Verde Is­lands, off the coast of Africa, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre in the United States.</p>
    <p>Separately, Sub­trop­i­cal Storm Al­pha formed 120km north of Lis­bon, Por­tu­gal, on Fri­day, and was trav­el­ling north-east at 27kmh with max­i­mum winds of 80kmh.</p>
    <p>The storm, fore­cast to move across Por­tu­gal’s cen­tral coast dur­ing the next few days, was pre­dicted to bring wind and rain to Por­tu­gal but was “ex­pected to be short­lived”, ac­cord­ing to the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The hur­ri­cane cen­tre also fore</p>
    <p>cast that Hur­ri­cane Teddy, a Cat­e­gory 4 storm, was ex­pected to ap­proach Ber­muda late today or early to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing reached the last name on the sea­son’s 21-en­try list of names, me­te­o­rol­o­gists will name fu­ture storms this sea­son us­ing the 24 letters of the Greek al­pha­bet, as they did with Al­pha on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Fore­cast­ers have re­sorted to the Greek al­pha­bet only once be­fore, in 2005, when me­te­o­rol­o­gists used six Greek names in a sea­son that had 28 named storms, said Mr Den­nis Felt­gen, a spokesman and me­te­o­rol­o­gist with the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre in Mi­ami.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Trop­i­cal Storm Beta</p>
    <p>has formed in the Gulf of Mex­ico, where it could men­ace the south Texas coast as a hur­ri­cane this week.</p>
    <p>Beta has winds of 64kmh and was about 450km south-east of the mouth of the Rio Grande, the US Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists at­trib­uted this year’s pre­dic­tion of height­ened storm ac­tiv­ity to fac­tors in­clud­ing warmerthan-av­er­age sea sur­face tem­per­a­tures in the trop­i­cal At­lantic and the Caribbean Sea, as well as an en­hanced West African mon­soon and re­duced ver­ti­cal wind shear, which can keep storms from form­ing or from be­com­ing stronger.</p>

Me&#xAD;te&#xAD;o&#xAD;rol&#xAD;o&#xAD;gists have been forced to break out the Greek al&#xAD;pha&#xAD;bet to name At&#xAD;lantic storms for only the sec&#xAD;ond time ever af&#xAD;ter the 2020 hur&#xAD;ri&#xAD;cane sea&#xAD;son blew through their usual list, end&#xAD;ing on Trop&#xAD;i&#xAD;cal Storm Wil&#xAD;fred.</p>
