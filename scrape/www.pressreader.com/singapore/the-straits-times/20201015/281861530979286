    <p>Euro­pean Union lead­ers are gath­er­ing in Brus­sels to­day for a sum­mit which, ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson, was meant to pro­vide the very last oc­ca­sion for con­clud­ing a free trade deal be­tween Bri­tain and the rest of the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>No such deal ap­pears in the off­ing and, in last-minute talks on the eve of the sum­mit, Mr Johnson ap­peared to have moved the goal­posts by claim­ing that he would be happy to get just “a con­fi­dent sign” that a trade deal is fea­si­ble to be sat­is­fied with progress in the ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, that pro­vides both sides with some respite.</p>
    <p>Still, time re­mains very short, and few of the crit­i­cal ar­eas of dis­agree­ment be­tween the two have been ad­dressed, let alone re­solved.</p>
    <p>“The ne­go­ti­a­tions are in a dif­fi­cult phase,” said Mr Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief ne­go­tia­tor with Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish for­mally left the EU in Jan­uary, sub­ject to a tran­si­tion pe­riod which keeps their trade re­la­tions with Europe un­changed, but that runs out at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>If no free trade deal is con­cluded, full bor­der con­trols and Cus­toms du­ties will have to go up as the clock strikes mid­night in the new year, in­flict­ing in­cal­cu­la­ble dam­age on trade with what is now the EU’s third-largest trad­ing part­ner, af­ter the US and China.</p>
    <p>Both sides want to avoid such a dis­as­trous out­come. But both sides have also re­fused to budge, claim­ing they do not fear the col­lapse of the ne­go­ti­a­tions and are fully pre­pared for ev­ery even­tu­al­ity.</p>
    <p>There are three ma­jor stick­ing points. The first is the EU de­mand that, in re­turn for a free trade deal, Bri­tain prom­ises not to un­der­cut Euro­pean man­u­fac­tur­ers and traders by of­fer­ing spe­cial sub­si­dies to its own pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the EU wants its own courts to have pow­ers to judge any fu­ture trade dis­putes with Bri­tain. And third, there is the Euro­pean de­mand to con­tinue en­joy­ing the same free ac­cess it had to Bri­tain’s fish­ing waters, which are rich and a ma­jor source of rev­enue, es­pe­cially for French fish­er­men.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish are pre­pared to give a guar­an­tee not to un­der­cut the EU in sub­si­dies. But they are not pre­pared to sub­ject them­selves to EU courts or al­low un­re­stricted fish­ing in their waters; as Mr Johnson fre­quently points out, the whole pur­pose of leav­ing the EU was not to be sub­jected to such de­mands.</p>
    <p>Still, many of the cur­rent po­si­tions are pos­tur­ing. In pri­vate, EU ne­go­tia­tors have ac­cepted that they may need to in­vent a new process of dis­pute res­o­lu­tion with the Bri­tish, sep­a­rate from Euro­pean courts.</p>
    <p>And all di­plo­mats know that the dis­pute about fish­ing is ridicu­lous. Fish­ing ac­counts for not more than 0.1 per cent of the economies of ei­ther the United King­dom or the EU, so it would be strange if a spat over fish tor­pe­does ne­go­ti­a­tions over €500 bil­lion (S$800 bil­lion) worth of UK-EU trade.</p>
    <p>But sen­si­tive po­lit­i­cal cal­cu­la­tions mat­ter. French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, al­ready un­der at­tack from his ru­ral vot­ers for ig­nor­ing their in­ter­ests, can­not af­ford to carry the blame for sac­ri­fic­ing the liveli­hood of his fish­er­men.</p>
    <p>And Mr Johnson also must be care­ful, for a con­ces­sion on fish­ing will be hugely un­pop­u­lar with fish­er­men in Scot­land, where de­mands for for­mal in­de­pen­dence from Bri­tain are in­creas­ing.</p>
    <p>On the eve of the sum­mit, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel, whose coun­try holds the ro­tat­ing pres­i­dency of the EU for the re­main­der of this year, has tried to cool tem­pers by em­pha­sis­ing the need for com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>“We have to take into ac­count the re­al­ity,” she said, “that an agree­ment has to be in the in­ter­ests of both par­ties, in Bri­tish in­ter­ests as well as the in­ter­ests of the 27-mem­ber Euro­pean Union.”</p>
    <p>Chan­cel­lor Merkel’s ap­peal was wel­comed by both sides. Still, it is not with­out its own dan­gers.</p>
    <p>For the Bri­tish have al­ways en­ter­tained the hope that, when trade talks with the EU get stuck, it would be Dr Merkel, as leader of Europe’s big­gest na­tion, who will step in and force other EU mem­ber states to ac­cept a com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish ne­go­tia­tors may there­fore now think that the Ger­man leader’s ap­peal for a com­pro­mise is a pre­lude for Ger­man pres­sure on the French to re­lent over fish­eries.</p>
    <p>Yet the Bri­tish may well be wrong not only in in­ter­pret­ing Ger­many’s po­si­tion, but also in as­sum­ing that their in­ter­minable prob­lems con­tinue to pre­oc­cupy the rest of Europe. For with Covid-19 cases on the con­ti­nent ris­ing again to cri­sis lev­els and the re­ces­sion deep­en­ing, EU lead­ers would be ex­cused if they rel­e­gate the fate of a coun­try which is no longer in their union to the mar­gins of their sum­mit.</p>
