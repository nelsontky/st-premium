    <p>WASHINGTON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said he will skip next week’s de­bate with Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den if it is not in-per­son, say­ing he will in­stead hold live ral­lies, as polls show him headed for a pos­si­ble de­feat.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s com­ments came mo­ments af­ter the Com­mis­sion on Pres­i­den­tial De­bates said next Thurs­day’s town hall-style fo­rum in Mi­ami – the sec­ond of three pres­i­den­tial de­bates – would be con­ducted vir­tu­ally as a pre­cau­tion against the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said the panel was try­ing “to pro­tect Bi­den” by cancelling the in-per­son de­bate.</p>
    <p>“No, I’m not go­ing to waste my time on a vir­tual de­bate,” Mr Trump said in a tele­phone in­ter­view with Fox Business yes­ter­day morn­ing. “That’s not what de­bat­ing’s about.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and sev­eral of his aides are re­cov­er­ing from Covid-19, af­ter reg­u­larly hold­ing events and meet­ings with­out masks or so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The first pres­i­den­tial de­bate, marked by Mr Trump con­stantly in­ter­rupt­ing and cross-talk­ing over Mr Bi­den, cost Mr Trump voter sup­port i n polls af­ter­wards, par­tic­u­larly among fe­male vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, speak­ing to re­porters yes­ter­day morn­ing, said he would fol­low the com­mis­sion’s rec­om­men­da­tions but that the fate of the de­bate re­mains un­clear.</p>
    <p>Both cam­paigns said the com­mis­sion acted with­out con­sult­ing them.</p>
    <p>In the vir­tual de­bate, mod­er­a­tor Steve Scully, C-Span’s po­lit­i­cal editor, will be live from the planned lo­ca­tion of the Adri­enne Ar­sht Cen­tre for the Per­form­ing Arts of Mi­ami-Dade County, and the com­mis­sion said the White House press pool will “pro­vide cov­er­age”.</p>
