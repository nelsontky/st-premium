    <p>More em­ploy­ees have been given the green light to re­turn to work­places, but there are still many chal­lenges fac­ing com­pa­nies and staff pre­par­ing to make the shift back to the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Th­ese range from the need to re­con­fig­ure work ar­eas to main­tain safe dis­tanc­ing to the men­tal read­just­ment work­ers have to make to pivot back to be­ing on-site.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duc­ing stag­gered hours or shifts may also cre­ate prob­lems, said hu­man re­source ex­ec­u­tives and ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong Chee Tung, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of hu­man re­source tech­nol­ogy firm En­gageRocket, said it might be coun­ter­pro­duc­tive to make staff work half the day at home, and half in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>“Task switch­ing has a sig­nif­i­cant ef­fect on at­ten­tion and pro­duc­tiv­ity, mak­ing it likely that be­ing sub­jected to such a split sched­ule will cause a lot more time spent men­tally wan­der­ing than fo­cused on work,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is much bet­ter to have ei­ther the full day work­ing in the of­fice, or work­ing from home.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mayank Parekh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als, said some com­pa­nies could ros­ter staff to work on al­ter­nate days or weeks in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>“There is a slight pref­er­ence for al­ter­nate weeks as if there’s any Covid-19 case in that one week, the next week, all staff can work off­site and won’t cross-con­tam­i­nate,” he added.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Trevor Yu of Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity’s busi­ness school said: “The chal­lenge with stag­ger­ing hours and shifts is to find a fair and equal sys­tem that takes into ac­count busi­ness re­quire­ments and the needs of em­ploy­ees.”</p>
    <p>He said it is crit­i­cal to in­volve staff in sched­ul­ing duty hours to set­tle on an ar­range­ment that sat­is­fies em­ploy­ees and em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Song Zhaoli from the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School said ir­reg­u­lar of­fice work­ing times can be­come a ma­jor source of stress.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore Covid-19, most work­ers had reg­u­lar work­ing hours in a week. Peo­ple knew when to go to work and when to come back home. Such cer­tainty makes it easy to co­or­di­nate fam­ily time as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Now, the new work scheme will lead to un­cer­tain­ties in terms of which days and what time to go to the of­fice and when to leave the of­fice. This will likely lead to stress.”</p>
    <p>FastJobs gen­eral man­ager Lim Huis­han said that it may also be nec­es­sary to im­ple­ment stag­gered lunchtimes if the vol­ume of peo­ple re­turn­ing to the of­fice is high, es­pe­cially since eater­ies also have re­duced ca­pac­i­ties due to safe dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the com­plex­i­ties brought on by ros­ter­ing staff, of­fices might also have to move to­wards dif­fer­ent spa­tial con­fig­u­ra­tions to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Prof Song said: “In the fu­ture, cowork­ing spa­ces are likely to be pre­ferred, given their flex­i­bil­ity to ad­just and change.</p>
    <p>“So­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures as well as a re­duced work­force work­ing from the of­fice will likely lead to the un­der­util­i­sa­tion of workspaces, which can be a sig­nif­i­cant cost.</p>
    <p>“How to make fu­ture workspaces more nim­ble and flex­i­ble will be ma­jor con­sid­er­a­tions in fu­ture of­fice design.”</p>
    <p>Unis­pace man­ag­ing direc­tor for Asia Toby Rak­i­son said of­fice spa­ces also need to shift to­wards fos­ter­ing col­lab­o­ra­tion rather than in­di­vid­ual work, which can be done at home.</p>
    <p>“Fun­da­men­tally, when it comes to of­fice design, the fo­cus needs to be less on the in­di­vid­ual desk and more on cre­at­ing con­ducive spa­ces.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in­surer Great East­ern recog­nised even be­fore the pan­demic that flexi-work ar­range­ments and mov­ing away from stan­dard rows of desks were the way to go.</p>
    <p>One of its of­fice floors was re­designed to in­clude fa­cil­i­ties for video­con­fer­enc­ing, workspaces that can be eas­ily con­verted for dif­fer­ent pur­poses, and open-con­cept col­lab­o­ra­tion ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“We must con­tinue to keep our minds open to new ways of work­ing. The pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated this for many in­dus­tries,” said Mr James Lee, the com­pany’s man­ag­ing direc­tor of group hu­man cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts reckon that com­pa­nies and staff are un­likely to rush back to the of­fice, ar­gu­ing that the chal­lenges of re­turn­ing to work­places may be al­le­vi­ated if peo­ple are eased in grad­u­ally, in­stead of all at once.</p>
    <p>A Straits Times poll on the news­pa­per’s so­cial me­dia pages and Tele­gram found that about 62 per cent of more than 7,100 re­spon­dents did not wel­come the move to re­turn to the work­place from this week.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong said: “Some em­ploy­ers are very ea­ger to have their em­ploy­ees back in of­fice to be able to ‘man­age by face time’, and there­fore</p>
    <p>rush the tran­si­tion back to work.</p>
    <p>“This would be a mis­take, and would in­cur pro­duc­tiv­ity cost. Eas­ing staff back to the of­fice grad­u­ally will al­low work­flows to adapt and main­tain high lev­els of pro­duc­tiv­ity in­stead of a big-bang ap­proach that is more likely to cause con­fu­sion.”</p>
    <p>Adecco Sin­ga­pore coun­try man­ager Be­tul Genc said: “De­spite the an­nounce­ment by the multi-min­istry task force, with telecom­mut­ing still the main mode of work and with strict reg­u­la­tions in place, we do not fore­see many com­pa­nies get­ting their em­ploy­ees to head back to work.”</p>
    <p>Prof Yu said: “Man­agers should be es­pe­cially at­ten­tive to the psy­cho­log­i­cal and so­cioe­mo­tional well-be­ing of their sub­or­di­nates dur­ing this time.</p>
    <p>“Reg­u­lar check-ins and get­ting con­stant feed­back on how the ad­just­ment is go­ing will be help­ful.”</p>
    <p>The 20 staff at non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion In­dus­trial and Ser­vices Co­op­er­a­tive So­ci­ety (Is­cos) will stick to their split-work ar­range­ment, with only the counter ser­vice and op­er­a­tions work­ers re­quired to be on-site to tend to clients.</p>
    <p>The rest will con­tinue work­ing from home un­less they have to go to the of­fice to ac­cess the client man­age­ment sys­tem or shared drives.</p>
    <p>“Although more can re­turn to the of­fice, we don’t have to max it out for the sake of do­ing so. We fore­see our­selves stay­ing in split-team ar­range­ments for a long time – un­til phase three, or when a vac­cine is found,” said Is­cos ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Doris Ng.</p>
    <p>But health-tech start-up Plano, which spe­cialises in my­opia man­age­ment, is look­ing at more staff re­turn­ing to the of­fice to re­store cross-team dis­cus­sions and re­vi­talise the com­pany’s cul­ture of ca­ma­raderie.</p>
    <p>“The new work­place con­di­tions were a re­lief for many of my staff, who have bub­bly per­son­al­i­ties and feed off one another’s ideas.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, cul­ture re­build­ing is more im­por­tant than keep­ing your com­pany alive,” said found­ing man­ag­ing direc­tor Mo­hamed Di­rani.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the an­nounce­ment that more em­ploy­ees can re­turn to the work­place, Plano’s ex­ec­u­tive team set guide­lines to al­low about 10 staff from var­i­ous sec­tions to go to the of­fice from this week at stag­gered times. The sched­ules will take into ac­count each worker’s in­puts and pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>Dr Di­rani also ac­knowl­edged that a sud­den shift in work sched­ul­ing af­ter work­ing from home for months can be stress­ful.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ees may have de­vel­oped habits over the last six months, and we need to be con­sid­er­ate and be ac­com­mo­dat­ing to those who need time to tran­si­tion.”</p>
