    <p>LON­DON/TOKYO • Bri­tain se­cured its first big post-Brexit trade deal yes­ter­day, an agree­ment with Ja­pan which it hailed as “his­toric”, as it strug­gles to agree on trade with its clos­est trad­ing part­ners in the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Since for­mally leav­ing the EU in Jan­uary, Bri­tain has fo­cused on ne­go­ti­at­ing new trade deals with other coun­tries, al­though ex­perts say they are un­likely to re­place ex­ports lost to the EU if a deal can­not be reached with Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>“This is a his­toric mo­ment for the UK and Ja­pan as our first ma­jor post-Brexit trade deal,” Bri­tish trade min­is­ter Liz Truss said.</p>
    <p>“The agree­ment we have ne­go­ti­ated – in record time and in chal­leng­ing cir­cum­stances – goes far be­yond the ex­ist­ing EU deal, as it se­cures new wins for Bri­tish busi­nesses in our great man­u­fac­tur­ing, food and drink, and tech in­dus­tries.”</p>
    <p>The deal had been widely seen as one the eas­i­est within reach for Lon­don, based largely on the EU-Ja­pan agree­ment which cov­ers Bri­tain un­til the end of De­cem­ber, when a Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>Other ne­go­ti­a­tions, es­pe­cially with the United States, have pro­gressed more slowly.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese For­eign</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Toshim­itsu Motegi said the talks had been dif­fi­cult “but we man­aged to reach an agree­ment in prin­ci­ple with ex­tra­or­di­nary speed, in just three months”.</p>
    <p>He said Ja­pan was aim­ing for the deal – which would help Ja­panese man­u­fac­tur­ers of train equip­ment and car com­po­nents – to come into force on Jan 1.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said the deal meant 99 per cent of its ex­ports to Ja­pan would be tar­iff-free, and that it could in­crease trade by £15.2 bil­lion (S$26.9 bil­lion) in the long run. Trade be­tween Bri­tain and Ja­pan was worth £29.5 bil­lion in 2018.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said dig­i­tal and data pro­vi­sions in the agree­ment would help Bri­tish fin­tech firms op­er­at­ing in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial ser­vices firms, coat­mak­ers and food pro­duc­ers would ben­e­fit from the agree­ment, and it rep­re­sented an “im­por­tant step” to­wards Bri­tain join­ing the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, it said.</p>
