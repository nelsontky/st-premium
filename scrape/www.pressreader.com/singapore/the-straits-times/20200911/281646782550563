    <p>The Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) yes­ter­day set out sev­eral im­prove­ments it will make to its pro­cesses for fu­ture elec­tions, to avoid the long queues seen at some polling sta­tions in the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>These in­clude boost­ing man­power and equip­ment al­lo­cated to polling sta­tions, re­duc­ing the num­ber of vot­ers at large polling sta­tions and re­view­ing the need for time bands.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise that the GE2020 pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures, while in­tended to pro­tect pub­lic health and safety, re­duced the vot­ing ef­fi­ciency for Singapore vot­ers and led to sus­tained queues at some polling sta­tions,” the ELD said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Longer than usual queues were seen at about 18 per cent of polling sta­tions – 199 out of a to­tal of 1,097 – in the morn­ing, but the sit­u­a­tion had im­proved at most sta­tions by 11am, the ELD said.</p>
    <p>About 6 per cent of all polling sta­tions con­tin­ued to see sus­tained long queues in the af­ter­noon and 4 per cent saw long queues through­out the day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the July 10 elec­tion, the ELD apol­o­gised for the in­con­ve­nience caused to vot­ers and pledged to study the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, it set out the find­ings of its re­view and the mea­sures it will take to “put them right” for fu­ture elec­tions.</p>
    <p>It said the queues were caused by sev­eral fac­tors such as the safe man­age­ment mea­sures put in place to pro­tect vot­ers dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break and the fact that re­sources at larger polling sta­tions could have been bet­ter dis­trib­uted.</p>
    <p>To ad­dress these is­sues, it will in­crease its pool of re­serve elec­tion of­fi­cers in fu­ture, so that they can be quickly de­ployed to polling sta­tions to help han­dle con­tin­gen­cies like un­fore­seen build-up in queues.</p>
    <p>It will also pro­vide more e-reg­is­tra­tion de­vices, which it noted have gen­er­ally sped up the reg­is­tra­tion process. This will also en­sure that faulty de­vices are re­placed quickly.</p>
    <p>The pro­cure­ment of these de­vices for GE2020 was done be­fore the Covid-19 out­break, it said.</p>
    <p>The ven­dor was not able to sup­ply more de­vices in time when the num­ber of polling sta­tions was in­creased sub­se­quently to al­low for safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Large polling sta­tions will be split up wherever fea­si­ble, the ELD added.</p>
    <p>It noted that for GE2020, larger sta­tions at Hous­ing Board void decks as well as pavil­ions in these es­tates were split ow­ing to the small avail­able space, but those in schools as well as com­mu­nity clubs and cen­tres were not.</p>
    <p>If it is not fea­si­ble to split up a polling sta­tion ow­ing to the lack of al­ter­na­tive premises in the area, the larger sta­tions will be bet­ter or­gan­ised and given more re­sources such as ad­di­tional man­power and equip­ment, the ELD said.</p>
    <p>It will also re­view the use of time bands to spread out vot­ers through­out the day.</p>
    <p>The ELD noted that in GE2020, the al­lo­cated time bands had failed to spread out voter turnout through­out the day.</p>
    <p>If it de­cides to con­tinue al­lo­cat­ing time bands to vot­ers, fewer will be given the morn­ing slots, it said.</p>
    <p>This is to pro­vide a more com­fort­able buf­fer for other vot­ers who vote out­side their time band as vot­ers gen­er­ally pre­fer to vote in the morn­ing, it noted.</p>
    <p>“In ret­ro­spect, we should not have con­cen­trated all se­nior vot­ers in the morn­ing. Go­ing for­ward, we will see how best to spread out se­nior and non-se­nior vot­ers across time bands,” said the ELD.</p>
    <p>“Given our age­ing pop­u­la­tion, we will also re­view the lo­gis­tics such as wheel­chairs and avail­abil­ity of seats, and the lo­ca­tion and set-up of our polling sta­tions to en­sure that they are well ac­ces­si­ble to our se­nior vot­ers.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the is­sues vot­ers faced, the pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures im­ple­mented were nec­es­sary and ef­fec­tive, the ELD said.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal voter turnout was the high­est since GE1997, at 95.63 per cent, it said, adding that there were no re­ported Covid-19 com­mu­nity cases af­fect­ing vot­ers and elec­tion of­fi­cials as a re­sult of their par­tic­i­pa­tion in GE2020.</p>
    <p>A poll by gov­ern­ment feed­back unit Reach found three in 10 vot­ers did not have a sat­is­fac­tory ex­pe­ri­ence in the July 10 elec­tion, which the ELD said is “un­ac­cept­able”.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment apol­o­gised for the long queues and thanked vot­ers for their pa­tience.</p>
    <p>“We would like to as­sure vot­ers that ELD will im­prove our sys­tems and pro­cesses as we pre­pare for fu­ture elec­tions,” it said.</p>
