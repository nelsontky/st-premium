    <p>WASHINGTON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is mulling over a rally in Florida on Jan 20, at the same time that Mr Joe Bi­den is in­au­gu­rated as the coun­try’s next pres­i­dent, ac­cord­ing to news re­ports.</p>
    <p>The sup­posed plan has drawn mixed feel­ings from even the Trump faith­ful, and was re­buked by Democrats.</p>
    <p>News sites such as NBC News and Ax­ios said Mr Trump planned to exit the White House in Ma­rina One, the pres­i­den­tial trans­port he­li­copter, and then take a flight on Air Force One to the Florida rally, in a snub to Mr Bi­den who beat him in the Novem­ber elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The Trump talk could cre­ate a split-screen mo­ment: the out­go­ing pres­i­dent ad­dress­ing a roar­ing crowd in an air­port hangar while the in­com­ing leader is sworn in be­fore a so­cially dis­tanced au­di­ence out­side the Capi­tol,” Ax­ios re­ported on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, 74, might even an­nounce that he will be run­ning for the 2024 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion that day, the re­ports said.</p>
    <p>The UK Daily Mail quoted White House spokesman Judd Deere as say­ing: “Anony­mous sources who claim to know what the Pres­i­dent is or is not con­sid­er­ing, have no idea. When Pres­i­dent Trump has an an­nounce­ment about his plans for Jan 20, he will let you know.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has so far re­fused to con­cede de­feat, and con­tin­ues to make base­less claims about mas­sive elec­toral fraud. It is rare but not un­prece­dented for a US pres­i­dent to be ab­sent from the swear­ing-in cer­e­mony of his suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>NBC News re­ported that four other pres­i­dents did this, with the last one be­ing Mr Richard Nixon who left the White House after his res­ig­na­tion 46 years ago and did not at­tend the inau­gu­ra­tion of Mr Ger­ald Ford in 1974.</p>
    <p>US Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Lois Frankel, a Demo­crat, was quoted by The Palm Beach Post as say­ing a coun­ter­ing pub­lic event by the out­go­ing pres­i­dent would be “rude, dis­re­spect­ful and em­bar­rass­ing”.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­lie Guardi­ola, who or­gan­ises pro-Trump street shows of sup­port through­out Palm Beach County, said: “Why is he plan­ning a rally when he won the elec­tion?”</p>
    <p>“I can’t re­late to an­other rally, I can’t pro­mote an­other rally, be­cause we have to do first things first” by con­tin­u­ing the le­gal chal­lenges in court, he added.</p>
