    <p>With the festive sea­son round the cor­ner, the au­thor­i­ties will step up checks and en­force­ment on the next few week­ends, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong told the me­dia yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>More safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors will be de­ployed, and they will be at hot spots and pop­u­lar ar­eas around the is­land to­gether with en­force­ment of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore can­not af­ford to let its guard down, cau­tioned Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I would again re­mind and en­cour­age ev­ery­one, just do your part, com­ply with the mea­sures. Do not push the bound­aries. This is not the time to let our guard down... to think that Sin­ga­pore is very safe and there­fore we can af­ford to push the bound­aries, re­lax and just en­joy our­selves with large gath­er­ings,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last week, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced that Sin­ga­pore will en­ter phase three of its re­open­ing on Dec 28.</p>
    <p>But just yes­ter­day, bor­der mea­sures had to be tight­ened for some trav­ellers from Bri­tain and the Aus­tralian state of New South Wales.</p>
    <p>This comes as re­cent re­ports sur­faced over a po­ten­tially more con­ta­gious strain of the Covid-19 virus cir­cu­lat­ing in Bri­tain, caus­ing of­fi­cials there to put in place more strin­gent restrictio­ns, in­clud­ing im­pos­ing a new lock­down in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The restrictio­ns on trav­ellers from New South Wales fol­low a clus­ter of cases cen­tred on two din­ing and en­ter­tain­ment venues in a Sydney sub­urb.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong stressed that even if some peo­ple are not caught by the en­hanced checks and en­force­ment – such as peo­ple in large gath­er­ings where “I close the doors... no one will know” – they ul­ti­mately en­dan­ger them­selves and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“The checks are not go­ing to be per­fect. Even if we fail to catch some peo­ple who may have com­mit­ted such breaches, at the end of the day, the peo­ple who are do­ing so are tak­ing risk upon them­selves,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They are risk­ing the health of them­selves and their fam­ily mem­bers be­cause I am sure the virus is still cir­cu­lat­ing around in our midst, in a hid­den way, in a very low level of trans­mis­sion – cryptic trans­mis­sion, if you call it – but it is hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>Five food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets have al­ready been or­dered to close, while 16 other out­lets and 36 in­di­vid­u­als will be fined for breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures, said the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The breaches were un­cov­ered dur­ing stepped-up en­force­ment checks over the past week­end.</p>
    <p>The es­tab­lish­ments had al­lowed groups of more than five to sit to­gether or in­ter­min­gle. Some served and al­lowed the con­sump­tion of al­co­hol past 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>The min­istry stressed last Fri­day that while many may wish to meet up with fam­ily and friends over the festive pe­riod, so­cial gath­er­ings in groups of more than five out­side an in­di­vid­ual’s res­i­dence are not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>F&B out­lets must not ac­cept book­ings from groups that are larger than five, even if they are split across mul­ti­ple ta­bles. In­ter­min­gling between groups is also pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said that while the au­thor­i­ties will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion at the bor­ders, within Sin­ga­pore, peo­ple have to con­tinue to take the pan­demic se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one must do their part within the com­mu­nity too to stay alert and vig­i­lant, recog­nis­ing that the threat is not over and we all have a part to play to com­plete our mis­sion to­gether.”</p>
    <p>THOSE WHO BREACH RULES RISK OWN HEALTH</p>
    <p>The checks are not go­ing to be per­fect. Even if we fail to catch some peo­ple who may have com­mit­ted such breaches, at the end of the day, the peo­ple who are do­ing so are tak­ing risk upon them­selves. They are risk­ing the health of them­selves and their fam­ily mem­bers be­cause I am sure the virus is still cir­cu­lat­ing around in our midst, in a hid­den way, in a very low level of trans­mis­sion – cryptic trans­mis­sion, if you call it – but it is hap­pen­ing.</p>
