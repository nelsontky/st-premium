    <p>TO ALL THE ROLES HE’S</p>
    <p>PLAYED BE­FORE: For­mer Chan­nel 8 star Hugo Ng was well known in Sin­ga­pore in the 1980s be­fore he went to Hong Kong in 1987 to fur­ther his act­ing ca­reer.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore ac­tor, who is cur­rently based in Hong Kong, re­vived fans’ mem­o­ries when he posted on Weibo a com­pos­ite photo (above, cropped) show­ing him in 50 act­ing roles through­out the years.</p>
    <p>Ng, 61, first posted a photo of his teenage self with a group of friends, writ­ing: “This pic­ture was taken dur­ing my first job as an of­fice boy when I was about 15 years old. Bell-bot­toms and high shoes were pop­u­lar then.</p>
    <p>“Time flies, and it felt like only yes­ter­day... What will you say to your younger self if you are given one minute to do so? I won­der if my younger self will un­der­stand me if I talk to him now.”</p>
    <p>Ng, who re­cently acted in the well-re­ceived TVB drama Find­ing Her Voice (2019), started the com­pos­ite photo with one of his first act­ing roles in the fa­mous lo­cal drama The Awak­en­ing 2 (1984), which starred the late Huang Weny­ong and Xiang Yun.</p>
    <p>Next, he posted pho­tos of him­self in then Sin­ga­pore Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion tele­vi­sion se­ri­als such as Pur­suit (1984) and Men Of Valour (1986). He in­cluded pho­tos of roles he played in Chi­nese dra­mas such as Beau­ties At The Cross­fire (2013) and The Demi-Gods And Semi-Devils (2013 to 2014).</p>
    <p>One of Ng’s lat­est roles is in an up­com­ing Web drama, The Se­cret Of Not Fall­ing In Love (above).</p>
    <p>He is mar­ried to ac­tress Lily Chung, 51, and they have a son, 23.</p>
