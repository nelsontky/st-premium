    <p>The state flag fly-past rep­re­sents one of the cli­mac­tic mo­ments of the Na­tional Day Pa­rade. The sight of a Chi­nook he­li­copter bear­ing the flag, against the back­ground of the evening sky, has an up­lift­ing ef­fect on those who are watch­ing. It is a spec­tac­u­lar dis­play of aerial might and pre­ci­sion lit­er­ally up­hold­ing the sanc­tity of the flag, which rep­re­sents noth­ing less than the en­tire na­tion. As heads crane up­wards to catch the sight, Sin­ga­pore­ans come to­gether and see their hopes and as­pi­ra­tions writ large on the hori­zon. The thrill never pales, from one Aug 9 to the next.</p>
    <p>There will be a dif­fer­ent kind of spec­ta­cle this year. In May, or­gan­is­ers dis­closed that the state flag fly-past will go to the heart­land. Res­i­dents will no doubt be wait­ing with in­ter­est for de­tails of where the route will take it. For many, it will be the first time that they will be able to watch the fly-past from their homes dur­ing this year’s pa­rade. Of course, the in­fec­tious sense of ca­ma­raderie that pre­vails among pa­rade spec­ta­tors will be ab­sent in this Covidean year, but such a fly­past will still bring the flag into com­mon view.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive on the state flag fly-past is akin to the de­ci­sion to give Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents Na­tional Day Pa­rade 2020 packs, avail­able at com­mu­nity cen­tres or clubs and res­i­dents’ com­mit­tee cen­tres, as part of this year’s con­cept of bring­ing the pa­rade into homes amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. In both cases, the point be­ing made is that the out­break can in­ter­rupt the ac­cus­tomed pace of na­tional life but it can­not al­ter it com­pletely.</p>
    <p>That is true too of the move to hold the Na­tional Day Is­tana Open House on­line this year, with vis­i­tors get­ting a tour of rarely seen fea­tures. This added at­trac­tion at­tests to the in­no­va­tive in­stincts that have come to the fore in this year’s cel­e­bra­tions. They pre­serve the con­ti­nu­ity of na­tional sen­ti­ment that sur­rounds the most im­por­tant day in the na­tional cal­en­dar.</p>
