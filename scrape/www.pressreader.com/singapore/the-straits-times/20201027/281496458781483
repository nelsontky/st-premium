    <p>Sin­ga­pore wants to be pow­ered by greener en­ergy sources in the years ahead, and has set in mo­tion a long-term plan to achieve this.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes a trial to im­port elec­tric­ity from Malaysia, which could pave the way for more re­new­able en­ergy im­ports from other na­tions in the re­gion, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For a start, the two-year trial with Malaysia will in­volve about 100MW of elec­tric­ity im­ports, with re­new­able en­ergy sources be­ing the pre­ferred op­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will also ramp up its ef­forts to in­stall more so­lar pan­els here, and in­vest in re­search on low-car­bon en­ergy so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>This en­ergy road map was an­nounced by Mr Chan dur­ing the open­ing of the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Su­bodh Mhaisalkar, an en­ergy ex­pert at the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, said the an­nounce­ments “clearly rep­re­sented a great deal of ur­gency and as­sured­ness in the sub­ject of de­car­bon­is­ing Sin­ga­pore’s en­ergy mix”.</p>
    <p>The en­ergy con­fer­ence is the first pi­lot meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions event host­ing up to 250 at­ten­dees on­site un­der the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s Safe Busi­ness Events Frame­work. This meant all par­tic­i­pants had to be tested for Covid-19 us­ing anti­gen rapid tests.</p>
    <p>Ms Jen Tan, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of so­lar for Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia in the en­ergy di­vi­sion at Sem­b­corp So­lar Sin­ga­pore, said the safety mea­sures were worth it if they meant par­tic­i­pants could at­tend the event in per­son.</p>
    <p>So­lar pan­els in­stalled on un­used land and rooftops, or float­ing on bod­ies of wa­ter, may soon be a com­mon sight as the coun­try ac­cel­er­ates its use of so­lar en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is aim­ing to har­ness 1.5 gi­gawatt-peak (GWp) of so­lar en­ergy by 2025, al­most four times the cur­rent so­lar us­age of 390 megawatt-peak (MWp).</p>
    <p>The 2025 goal, an­nounced by Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day, will be able to power about 260,000 house­holds an­nu­ally, meet­ing about 2 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal elec­tric­ity needs. The new target will ac­cel­er­ate the coun­try’s goal to em­ploy 2GWp of so­lar en­ergy by 2030.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week, Mr Chan said the pub­lic sec­tor will take the lead in ex­pe­dit­ing so­lar ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>To har­ness so­lar en­ergy on an is­land with l and con­straints and some­times cloudy skies that block out sun­light, the strat­egy is to max­imise the de­ploy­ment of so­lar pan­els, op­ti­mise their use with en­er­gys­tor­ing tech­nolo­gies, and in­vest in re­search and de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Su­bodh Mhaisalkar, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the En­ergy Re­search In­sti­tute at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, said: “New tech­nolo­gies for build­ing in­te­grated pho­to­voltaics, bi­fa­cial so­lar cells and high-ef­fi­ciency so­lar cells would also need to be de­vel­oped.”</p>
    <p>The na­tion’s first float­ing and stacked en­ergy stor­age sys­tem, on Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine’s Float­ing Liv­ing Lab, an up­com­ing off­shore test bed, is ex­pected to be up and run­ning in 2023.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, clean en­ergy so­lu­tions provider Sun­seap will be build­ing Sin­ga­pore’s largest off­shore float­ing so­lar panel sys­tems along the Strait of Jo­hor. The elec­tric­ity gen­er­ated can power about 1,250 four-room HDB flats.</p>
    <p>Sun­seap’s head of mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions Rob Khoo said train­ing and re­cruit­ment of tal­ents in the so­lar in­dus­tries must in­crease to cater for more so­lar en­ergy projects.</p>
    <p>Prof Su­bodh said that for the 1.5GWp target, which is a “very ma­jor scale-up” from where the coun­try is at to­day, strong par­tic­i­pa­tion from the pri­vate sec­tor is needed.</p>
    <p>Dr Thomas Reindl, deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s So­lar En­ergy Re­search In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore, said land lease pe­ri­ods and ac­cess to project fi­nanc­ing are some things that pri­vate en­ti­ties need to con­sider be­fore start­ing so­lar projects.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, the du­ra­tion of so­lar in­stal­la­tion, which is up to 20 years or more, may ex­ceed the re­main­ing lease left on the land or rooftop of a pri­vate com­pany,” he noted.</p>
    <p>He added that mo­bile so­lar pan­els could sit well with pri­vate com­pa­nies that in­vest in so­lar en­ergy.</p>
    <p>“So, if the build­ing owner has only 10 or 12 years left, but those com­pa­nies have the op­tion to move (the so­lar pan­els) some­where else, their re­turns would still work out,” added Dr Reindl.</p>
