    <p>Al­most 70 per cent of small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) have yet to adopt data an­a­lyt­ics, with many of them fa­mil­iar only with spread­sheets and data­bases, sug­gest­ing a lack of aware­ness and un­der­stand­ing of ad­vanced data an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>That is ac­cord­ing to a study by the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, RSM Sin­ga­pore and the In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore Char­tered Ac­coun­tants, re­leased on Oct 15. They sur­veyed 575 SMEs – from sec­tors in­clud­ing com­mer­cial and pro­fes­sional ser­vices, en­gi­neer­ing and real es­tate – be­tween Novem­ber 2018 and April this year. About 65 per cent of those sur­veyed have an an­nual turnover of less than $25 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The study found that of the SMEs yet to adopt data an­a­lyt­ics, about half have no in­ten­tion to do so in the fu­ture. These re­spon­dents’ top con­cerns in­cluded data pro­tec­tion and pri­vacy, lim­ited fi­nan­cial re­sources and the lack of in­for­ma­tion sys­tems in­fra­struc­ture sup­port.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, such re­spon­dents are fa­mil­iar with only Google Sheets and Mi­crosoft Ex­cel. Their knowl­edge of data an­a­lyt­ics comes largely from the In­ter­net and word of mouth.</p>
    <p>“Shar­ing of suc­cess sto­ries and pro­vid­ing real-life ex­am­ples on how po­ten­tial mon­e­tary ben­e­fits can be achieved with data an­a­lyt­ics adop­tion can be con­sid­ered,” the study sug­gested.</p>
    <p>“As suc­cess sto­ries spread among the SMEs, more of them may be en­cour­aged to con­sider em­brac­ing data an­a­lyt­ics as part of their busi­ness model.”</p>
    <p>The other com­pa­nies that had yet to adopt data an­a­lyt­ics in­di­cated that they may do so in fu­ture and cited gov­ern­ment sup­port as the chief driv­ing fac­tor. Other key driv­ers were to do with the ease of im­ple­men­ta­tion and per­for­mance ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­port noted that although gov­ern­ment sup­port via grants is widely avail­able, some SMEs face dif­fi­culty tap­ping them. This is be­cause some fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance schemes may re­quire the firms to first pro­vide up­front funds to im­ple­ment dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>For this group of firms, their knowl­edge of data an­a­lyt­ics comes largely from the In­ter­net and sem­i­nars or work­shops.</p>
    <p>“As these SMEs are open to learn­ing about how data an­a­lyt­ics can ben­e­fit their or­gan­i­sa­tions, hav­ing a shared ser­vices plat­form that these SMEs can tap could be very use­ful i n keep­ing costs down,” the re­port also sug­gested.</p>
    <p>Such a plat­form could be set up with con­sul­tants to pro­vide dif­fer­ent lev­els of data an­a­lyt­ics ca­pa­bil­i­ties, from the ba­sic to the ad­vanced.</p>
