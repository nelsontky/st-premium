    <p>A job­less man was roped in to ap­ply for a loan for a house he had no means to buy, on a prom­ise of $5,000 he never re­ceived.</p>
    <p>Iswandi Yahya, 38, yes­ter­day ad­mit­ted in a district court he had cheated Malayan Bank­ing (May­bank) into de­liv­er­ing the mort­gage loan of $2.84 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>He was un­able to re­pay the loan and this led to May­bank los­ing more than $1.2 mil­lion. No resti­tu­tion has been made to date.</p>
    <p>Iswandi and for­mer prop­erty agent Mo­hamad Hamzi Rabu, 50, were in court over their roles in a scam in which ar­range­ments were made in 2014 to sell a house in Wood­grove Walk, near Woodlands Av­enue 1, for $2.4 mil­lion but to state a price of $3.55 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Hamzi, the seller of the house, yes­ter­day ad­mit­ted he had fraud­u­lently ex­e­cuted a trans­fer form con­tain­ing the false state­ment.</p>
    <p>The two men’s al­leged ac­com­plices are Mo­hamed Haron Has­san, 39, Bi­jaba­hadur Rai Shree Kantrai, 50, and Juma’at Jo­hari and Su­fandi Ah­mad, both 40.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing th­ese four men are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Bi­jaba­hadur had pro­posed the “cash­back scheme” to Su­fandi, whose role was to look for pri­vate landed prop­er­ties on sale.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Joseph Gwee and Bene­dict Chan said that in 2014, Su­fandi learnt the Wood­grove Walk house was for sale and roped Iswandi in as a buyer. Iswandi would ap­ply for a mort­gage loan in his name to buy the house. He was told he would be paid $5,000 later.</p>
    <p>Iswandi agreed to take part in the ruse even though he had no fi­nan­cial means to buy the house.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Su­fandi also ob­tained forged doc­u­ments, in­clud­ing one pur­port­edly from the In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, falsely stat­ing Iswandi had an an­nual in­come of more than $470,000 in 2013.</p>
    <p>May­bank re­ceived th­ese doc­u­ments be­fore ap­prov­ing the loan of $2.84 mil­lion to Iswandi.</p>
    <p>Iswandi will be sen­tenced next Tues­day, while Hamzi will be sen­tenced on Jan 6 next year.</p>
