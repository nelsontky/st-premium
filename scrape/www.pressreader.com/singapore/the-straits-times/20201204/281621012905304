    <p>The Spize in­ci­dent in 2018 was one of the coun­try’s worst food poi­son­ing episodes since 2009, when two women died af­ter eat­ing at an In­dian ro­jak stall in Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Here is how the sit­u­a­tion un­folded at se­cu­rity firm Brink’s Sin­ga­pore:</p>
    <p>NOV 6, 2018</p>
    <p>Spize de­liv­ers 88 bento sets to Brink’s Sin­ga­pore for its com­pany event.</p>
    <p>NOV 7</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health is alerted to a po­ten­tial out­break of food poi­son­ing. In­ves­ti­ga­tions showed that 96 peo­ple had con­sumed food from the boxes, as some had taken their bento sets home to share with their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>NOV 8</p>
    <p>One of the af­fected staff, Mr Mo­hamad Fadli Mohd Saleh, is ad­mit­ted to an in­ten­sive care unit af­ter his con­di­tion de­te­ri­o­rates and he be­comes un­re­spon­sive. Al­to­gether, 45 of the 63 peo­ple who had de­vel­oped gas­troen­teri­tis symp­toms are hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>NOV 14</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamad Fadli dies.</p>
    <p>DEC 6</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing li­cences of Spize and Spize Events, both based in River Val­ley, are can­celled.</p>
    <p>AUG 23, 2019</p>
    <p>The death of Mr Mo­hamad Fadli is ruled an “un­for­tu­nate mis­ad­ven­ture” by the State Coro­ner.</p>
    <p>The State Coro­ner also high­lights alarm­ing hy­giene lapses at Spize’s River Val­ley out­let, point­ing out that sal­mo­nella strains and fae­cal mat­ter were found on readyto-eat food and kitchen tools.</p>
    <p>DEC 3, 2020</p>
    <p>Spize and Spize Events are fined $32,000.</p>
