    <p>The re­vamp of a Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) build­ing was found to have gone over bud­get by $1.72 mil­lion due to a lack of scru­tiny from its of­fi­cers, the Au­di­tor-Gen­eral’s Of­fice (AGO) said.</p>
    <p>In its an­nual au­dit of gov­ern­ment ac­counts, the AGO also flagged prob­lem­atic cash col­lec­tion and con­tract man­age­ment pro­cesses in JTC Cor­po­ra­tion. It found that premises leased and ten­anted out by JTC may have been sub­let to 26,000 en­ti­ties with­out ap­proval as well.</p>
    <p>Spot checks fur­ther un­cov­ered the il­le­gal stor­age and sale of diesel on four of its in­dus­trial premises, which could pose en­vi­ron­men­tal and safety risks to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The AGO de­tailed these find­ings in a report re­leased yes­ter­day on gov­ern­ment ac­counts for the fi­nan­cial year 2019/2020.</p>
    <p>In its report, the AGO said NLB had an ap­proved bud­get of $20.53 mil­lion for the re­vamp of the Na­tional Ar­chives of Sin­ga­pore build­ing, which re­opened in April last year af­ter an 18-month makeover.</p>
    <p>The AGO found that the man­age­ment of the re­vamp was “in­ad­e­quate on sev­eral fronts” due to a lack of scru­tiny from ap­prov­ing of­fi­cers. In par­tic­u­lar, it noted that more than half of con­tract vari­a­tions were given in-prin­ci­ple ap­provals (IPAs), even though no ball­park cost es­ti­mates were pro­vided.</p>
    <p>This meant that NLB had ap­proved works even though it did not know the costs in­volved, said the AGO. In one case, the vari­a­tion was as high as $370,000.</p>
    <p>The lack of proper mon­i­tor­ing caused the cost of the re­vamp to in­crease by more than 8 per cent, to more than $22 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The AGO also found that NLB sought ap­proval from its ap­prov­ing au­thor­ity to ex­ceed the ini­tial ap­proved project costs only five months af­ter it learnt of the cost over­run. Do­ing so un­der­mined the role of the ap­prov­ing au­thor­ity and in­di­cated a weak­ness in fi­nan­cial con­trols, the AGO said.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, NLB said it in­tro­duced the IPA process in Septem­ber 2018 to al­low ur­gent vari­a­tion works to be car­ried out quickly. While these ap­provals are then re­viewed by NLB-ap­proved con­sul­tants be­fore any pay­ment is made, the board said it will re­view its pro­cesses to en­sure ap­provals for con­tract vari­a­tions are prompt and well doc­u­mented, in­clud­ing for all ur­gent ren­o­va­tion works.</p>
    <p>In JTC’s case, the AGO’s checks on the firm’s lease and ten­ancy</p>
    <p>man­age­ment found sus­pected cases of unau­tho­rised sub­let­ting on its premises.</p>
    <p>When sub­let­ting, lessees or ten­ants of JTC – an in­dus­trial land and in­fras­truc­ture agency – have to com­ply with con­di­tions such as the max­i­mum sub­let area and pay­ment of sub­let­ting fees once ap­pli­ca­tions are ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The AGO found about 26,000 busi­ness en­ti­ties had in­di­cated JTC premises as their reg­is­tered ad­dresses, even though these were nei­ther JTC’s lessees or ten­ants, nor sub­tenants it had ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Unau­tho­rised sub­let­ting would ex­pose JTC to unau­tho­rised or il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties on its premises and fi­nan­cial loss due to un­der-col­lec­tion of sub­let fees, AGO warned.</p>
    <p>Be­tween last Novem­ber and this Jan­uary, AGO con­ducted site vis­its and found 41 sus­pected</p>
    <p>unau­tho­rised sub­tenants on 12 of 15 JTC premises.</p>
    <p>No­tably, on four of these premises, AGO found il­le­gal stor­age and sale of diesel to the pub­lic, which it said pose en­vi­ron­men­tal and safety risks to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing this, JTC in­ves­ti­gated 2,792 of the 26,000 busi­ness en­ti­ties and dis­cov­ered that 2,010 of these were sus­pected cases of unau­tho­rised sub­let­ting. Out of these, 1,260 were re­lated en­ti­ties of lessees and ten­ants.</p>
    <p>JTC said yes­ter­day that it has strength­ened its in­spec­tion regime to de­tect and re­duce such unau­tho­rised sub­let­ting.</p>
    <p>It has also worked with the author­i­ties to take ac­tion against ten­ants who store or sell diesel il­le­gally, and with the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force to grant li­cences to store diesel only if lessees had ob­tained prior con­sent to in­stall diesel tanks on its premises.</p>
    <p>AGO also found that JTC of­fi­cers who re­ceived cash would also record the re­ceipts, but that there were in­ad­e­quate checks of cash be­ing banked in.</p>
    <p>When a re­ceipt is recorded in JTC’s ac­count­ing sys­tem, a hard­copy re­ceipt printed on se­ri­ally num­bered pa­pers is gen­er­ated. One por­tion of the re­ceipt is given to the cus­tomer, while an­other is re­tained by JTC for record.</p>
    <p>But AGO’s checks of the re­ceipts re­tained by JTC be­tween April 1, 2018 and Oct 15, 2019 found eight miss­ing. While five of them were later pro­vided, three could not be found. JTC has since car­ried out an in­ves­ti­ga­tion and lodged a po­lice report. It has also stopped ac­cept­ing cash pay­ments from this Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the AGO found pos­si­ble ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties in three quo­ta­tions sub­mit­ted by one of JTC’s con­trac­tors, which it had asked to pro­vide driver services for one year from April 2017.</p>
    <p>The AGO had con­cerns over the au­then­tic­ity of these quo­ta­tions, not­ing that JTC ac­cepted the low­est quo­ta­tion with­out com­par­ing the quo­ta­tions re­ceived with pre­vi­ous rates for sim­i­lar services.</p>
    <p>The low­est quo­ta­tion was be­tween 17 per cent and 100 per cent higher than pre­vi­ous rates paid for sim­i­lar driver services, and a to­tal of $66,240 was paid to the con­trac­tor for the services.</p>
    <p>JTC told the AGO that ro­bust checks by its staff were ab­sent in re­view­ing and ap­prov­ing the quo­ta­tions and that it would be tak­ing dis­ci­plinary ac­tion against its staff.</p>
    <p>JTC has also lodged a po­lice report on this is­sue.</p>
