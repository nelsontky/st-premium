    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Tiger Woods is pre­par­ing for a jour­ney into the un­known as he heads into to­day’s PGA Cham­pi­onship hunt­ing for a 16th Ma­jor against the sur­real back­drop of a de­serted course at TPC Hard­ing Park.</p>
    <p>Through­out his ca­reer, the former world No. 1 has be­come ac­cus­tomed to roar­ing gal­leries fol­low­ing his ev­ery shot, pro­vid­ing a jolt of en­ergy that he has fed off time and again.</p>
    <p>Yet this year’s first Ma­jor in San Fran­cisco will be dif­fer­ent be­cause of the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions im­posed to stem the spread of Covid-19 means the tour­na­ment will be a fan-free, muted af­fair.</p>
    <p>Woods got an early taste of his changed en­vi­ron­ment dur­ing a me­dia brief­ing ahead of to­day’s open­ing round. Where in the past a scrum of re­porters would have at­tended, only a hand­ful of jour­nal­ists were present.</p>
    <p>“Well, that’s an un­known,” he said when asked about how the ab­sence of fans might af­fect his chances. “I don’t know if any­one in our gen­er­a­tion has ever played with­out fans in a Ma­jor cham­pi­onship. It’s go­ing to be very dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“But it’s still a Ma­jor cham­pi­onship. It’s still the best play­ers in the world. We all un­der­stand that go­ing into it, so there’s go­ing to be plenty of en­ergy from the com­pet­i­tive side.</p>
    <p>“But as far as the en­ergy out­side the ropes, that is an un­known. And hope­fully, I can put my­self in a po­si­tion where I can be in that po­si­tion where I can feel what it feels like to have no fans and also com­ing down the stretch with a chance to win.”</p>
    <p>His former cad­die, Steve Wil­liams, is among those who be­lieve that the lack of fans might prove to be a hin­drance.</p>
    <p>“With that el­e­ment miss­ing, for some­one who hasn’t played a lot of tour­na­ment golf this year, it’ll be chal­leng­ing for Tiger to find that spark he needs,” the New Zealan­der said ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>World No. 15 Woods first ex­pe­ri­enced the fan-less re­al­ity at the Memo­rial Tour­na­ment last month, where he fin­ished tied for 40th, but is re­signed to “the new world we live in” and ad­mit­ted he would “just have to get used to it”.</p>
    <p>Aside from an empty gallery, he has an­other con­cern, with this week’s weather fore­cast in San Fran­cisco pre­dict­ing cooler than av­er­age tem­per­a­tures. Spinal fusion surgery has made his lower back vul­ner­a­ble to chilly weather, with the city record­ing 13 deg C yes­ter­day de­spite it be­ing sum­mer sea­son.</p>
    <p>“When it’s cooler like this, it’s just mak­ing sure that my core stays warm, lay­er­ing up prop­erly,” he said. “I know I won’t have the same range of mo­tion as I would back home in Florida where it’s 35 deg C ev­ery day. That’s just the way it is.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he will not be us­ing the weather as an ex­cuse, claim­ing he had spent most of his five-month down­time prac­tis­ing at home.</p>
    <p>“I feel good,” he said. “Ob­vi­ously, I haven’t played much com­pet­i­tively, but... this is what I’ve been gear­ing up for. We’ve got a lot of big events start­ing from here, so look­ing for­ward to it. This is go­ing to be a fun test for all of us.”</p>
    <p>PAN­DEMIC HITS THE FAN</p>
    <p>I don’t know if any­one in our gen­er­a­tion has ever played with­out fans in a Ma­jor cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>It’s go­ing to be very dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>TIGER WOODS, world No. 15, on how the ab­sence of fans this week could af­fect his chances of win­ning his 16th Ma­jor ti­tle.</p>
    <p>He will be grouped with four­time Ma­jor win­ner Rory McIl­roy of North­ern Ire­land and topranked Justin Thomas, who is seek­ing his sec­ond Ma­jor since claim­ing the 2017 edi­tion, to­day.</p>
    <p>Fel­low Amer­i­can Thomas comes into the tour­na­ment as the hottest com­mod­ity in golf, hav­ing won three events this year, in­clud­ing the WGC-St Jude In­vi­ta­tional last Sun­day.</p>
