    <p>Hit­ting the books can be a slog for any­one, but mov­ing up the learn­ing curve can be the best in­vest­ment de­ci­sion you could ever make, reck­ons fi­nan­cial ser­vices ex­ec­u­tive Sam Lee.</p>
    <p>“Ed­u­ca­tion is one of the most valu­able tools in life and it can open the doors to suc­cess when we utilise it prop­erly,” says Mr Lee, 33.</p>
    <p>“The les­son here is that it is al­ways bet­ter to teach some­one how to fish than to fish on their be­half.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee’s life and ca­reer are tes­ta­ment to that ap­proach.</p>
    <p>He cites his par­ents’ com­mit­ment to ed­u­ca­tion as the key rea­son for his suc­cess to­day, which is un­der­pinned by his bach­e­lor’s de­gree in busi­ness man­age­ment from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU).</p>
    <p>“My par­ents fo­cused and spent a lot on our ed­u­ca­tion, which I will al­ways be grate­ful for.”</p>
    <p>He be­gan his ca­reer in the merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions (M&A) in­dus­try be­fore start­ing fi­nan­cial ser­vices firm Paloe in 2016.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, the firm’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, works with small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises and start-ups, pro­vid­ing guid­ance to their fi­nance teams or tak­ing over the teams’ func­tions.</p>
    <p>Paloe, which em­ploys 15 staff in three coun­tries and works with about 10 free­lance pro­fes­sion­als, aims to be­come a re­gional player in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>Help­ing com­pa­nies nav­i­gate the up and downs of the busi­ness world has given Mr Lee valu­able in­sights into how in­di­vid­ual in­vestors should ap­proach their own fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>The watch­word is cau­tion: As­sess­ing your risk ca­pac­ity is an im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion, Mr Lee says. He en­cour­ages in­vestors to be mind­ful of their job se­cu­rity be­fore jump­ing into an in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, he says. “You should take into ac­count the run­way needed to tide you and your fam­ily over, es­pe­cially if you have been sig­nif­i­cantly im­pacted by Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>He con­sid­ers it for­tu­nate that he did not work in a high-pay­ing role in the first few years of his ca­reer, as it may have prompted him to make more risky fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“With a lower in­come, I had to plan my spend­ing wisely. If I had started with a ca­reer at an in­vest­ment bank, I be­lieve that my spend­ing power would have been stronger, but I would not have been so care­ful and con­scious with my money.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee is mar­ried to a civil ser­vant. They have a one-year-old son.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your per­sonal port­fo­lio? A Most of my fam­ily’s in­vest­ments are in in­sur­ance and funds. Our di­rect eq­uity in­vest­ments are small, and we have al­lo­cated a por­tion to in­vest in young busi­nesses with strong man­age­ment teams.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of my per­sonal in­vest­ments are in young com­pa­nies and are in the form of con­vert­ible notes.</p>
    <p>I also have some in­sur­ance in­vest­ments to en­sure my fam­ily’s fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity in case of any un­for­tu­nate events.</p>
    <p>Un­like most in­vestors, I have lit­tle ex­po­sure to eq­ui­ties or the stock mar­ket. One of the main rea­sons was re­stric­tions dur­ing my in­tern­ship and early ca­reer – as an M&A pro­fes­sional, I was re­quired to de­clare any in­vest­ments I made.</p>
    <p>Per­son­ally, I be­lieve that the only rea­son value in­vest­ing still works is that a large group of peo­ple still be­lieve in fun­da­men­tal anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I be­lieve the greater driver for stock price is de­mand and sup­ply of shares. It has noth­ing to do with com­pany per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Mr War­ren Buf­fett’s in­vest­ment style works only be­cause he took con­trol and/or had a cer­tain level of in­flu­ence over his com­pany. Thus, as small in­vestors, we will have no in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Com­ing from the pri­vate in­vest­ment in­dus­try, I tend to be­lieve more in the re­turns from pri­vate eq­uity. How­ever, the is­sue is its illiq­uid­ity.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A I would be keen to ex­plore fur­ther de­ploy­ment of cap­i­tal in small tra­di­tional busi­nesses if the right op­por­tu­nity comes along.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>How did you be­come in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A My father was the rea­son why I be­came in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing – he gave me a small amount to test the mar­ket and make some in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>With this in­ter­est, I joined SMU’s stu­dent-man­aged in­vest­ment fund club, where I had fur­ther ex­po­sure to eq­uity in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>It was only when I went into pri­vate in­vest­ments that I re­alised the im­por­tance of non-pub­lic in­for­ma­tion in mak­ing good in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Q A</p>
    <p>De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that I am a risk-taker, and I look at in­vest­ment from a holis­tic an­gle, tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion my fam­ily’s and my salaries.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, I pre­fer to in­vest in in­dus­tries that I am fa­mil­iar with or in­dus­tries that a close friend has rec­om­mended and is con­fi­dent in.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan? A I have nor­mal sav­ings plans in place, and have had dis­cus­sions with my wife about putting some money into in­dex funds for our son.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I will most likely need $500,000 in my re­tire­ment years. This as­sumes a small monthly al­lowance. I am a sim­ple man and do not ex­pect to have large ex­penses.</p>
    <p>I am hop­ing to reach fi­nan­cial free­dom by 57 years old – my son would have com­pleted univer­sity by then.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I plan to con­tinue work­ing then. Just like how I am lucky to have many prom­i­nent in­di­vid­u­als as men­tors, I am hop­ing to men­tor and coach the younger gen­er­a­tion when I am older.</p>
    <p>Q Money­wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A I have two younger sib­lings. My sec­ond brother is work­ing in the health­care in­dus­try, and my youngest brother is do­ing his PhD at the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy now, on a schol­ar­ship.</p>
    <p>My fam­ily never spent lav­ishly, but we love good food. We have al­ways hunted for good food at hawker cen­tres and restau­rants around Sin­ga­pore, and con­tinue to do so.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A Money is not the most im­por­tant thing in life. Af­ter all, we are only stew­ards of our wealth. I be­lieve that God pro­vides, and he gives us the re­sources for a rea­son. Thus, I hold money with loose hands.</p>
    <p>Q Home is...</p>
    <p>A We were lucky to buy a unit in The Brown­stone, an ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium (EC) in Can­berra Drive, in 2015.</p>
    <p>We rushed to buy it when the an­nounce­ment was made of the in­crease in the in­come ceil­ing for buy­ers of ECs to $14,000, and it was right be­fore our salary in­cre­ments.</p>
    <p>Our unit is about 1,000 sq ft and has three bed­rooms. For now, I am in­sis­tent on not driv­ing, so I wanted to find a home be­side an MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Q I drive...</p>
    <p>A I do not drive. Due to the fact that I do not think it is needed for the mo­ment, I have not ob­tained a driv­ing li­cence. How­ever, things may change in the near fu­ture be­cause I have a young son and be­cause of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
