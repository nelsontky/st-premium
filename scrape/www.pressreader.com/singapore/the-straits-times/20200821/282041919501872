    <p>De­spite the new chal­lenges brought about by Covid-19, the fu­ture is not all doom and gloom, with sup­port avail­able for those re­quir­ing help. Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob shared this mes­sage, and her con­cerns for fam­i­lies with fi­nan­cial woes who are un­aware of ben­e­fits and sub­si­dies, dur­ing her visit to non-profit group AMP Sin­ga­pore’s of­fice at Pasir Ris East Com­mu­nity Build­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She said: “I can see that fam­i­lies are un­der a lot of stress. To­day, fam­i­lies face a lot of chal­lenges. There’re a lot of con­cerns be­cause our so­ci­ety is evolv­ing so rapidly.</p>
    <p>“And then of course, there are new chal­lenges and new con­cerns that they have to deal with. Then on top of all that, we are right in the midst of Covid-19. There are also con­cerns of loss of in­come, jobs and liveli­hood. So that ex­ac­er­bates the whole sit­u­a­tion. There­fore, it’s very im­por­tant that there’s enough help be­ing pro­vided.”</p>
    <p>She ad­vised fam­i­lies fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties ser­vic­ing their l oans to “seek help early”.</p>
    <p>With a fo­cus on the Mus­lim com­mu­nity, AMP, for­merly known as the As­so­ci­a­tion of Mus­lim Pro­fes­sion­als, pro­vides sup­port to fam­i­lies, debtors, mi­cro-busi­ness own­ers, stu­dents, youth and pro­fes­sion­als. As part of its Debt Ad­vi­sory Cen­tre, AMP helps 140 clients fac­ing prob­lems by pro­vid­ing them with ad­vice and in­for­ma­tion on how best to pay back their loans.</p>
    <p>It also helps an­other 60 fam­i­lies who are part of its Adopt A Fam­ily and Youth Scheme, where donors spon­sor un­der­priv­i­leged fam­i­lies in the in­terim, while a case worker helps them to up­skill, find em­ploy­ment or tap sub­si­dies and bur­saries for the chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing her visit, Madam Hal­imah met ben­e­fi­cia­ries of AMP who had over­come ad­ver­si­ties with the as­so­ci­a­tion’s help.</p>
    <p>One of them was doc­u­ment con­troller Simah Mohamed, 51, who re­ceived sup­port to pay back her debts and cut ties with un­li­censed money­len­ders. The mother of two had turned to AMP in Jan­uary 2018 after her debt snow­balled. Now, she at­tends sup­port group meet­ings to en­cour­age oth­ers. “Be strong enough to voice out your prob­lems, there will al­ways be help,” she said.</p>
