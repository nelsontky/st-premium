    <p>When Norhay­ati Md Yunos could not fall asleep on Fri­day night, she de­cided to take the train to The Cen­tre­point early the next morn­ing in an­tic­i­pa­tion of De­cathlon Orchard’s of­fi­cial open­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle did she know that she would end up be­ing the first per­son in the queue when she ar­rived at 7am.</p>
    <p>The medical worker said: “I couldn’t sleep at all so I just thought that I’d make my way down be­cause some­times Sin­ga­pore­ans can queue for more than two hours.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t ex­pect to be the first one.”</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old had planned to go to the store to get yoga ap­parel such as mois­ture-wick­ing shirts and pants.</p>
    <p>She ex­plained: “I pre­fer the ex­pe­ri­ence of go­ing to a phys­i­cal brickand-mor­tar shop be­cause I can check the mer­chan­dise and see it for my­self. I’m not big on on­line shop­ping.”</p>
    <p>Other ea­ger shop­pers started to trickle in at about 8.30am and within an hour, a queue of over 50 peo­ple had formed out­side the store’s main door on the ground level.</p>
    <p>Lined up in two rows, staff don­ning blue-and-white De­cathlon tops cheered and wel­comed the out­let’s first cus­tomers as they streamed into the store when it opened its doors at 10am.</p>
    <p>Among the shop­pers was sales di­rec­tor Dan McQueen, who was cu­ri­ous to see what De­cathlon had to of­fer.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old said: “I like the lay­out of the shop, it’s spa­cious and it has a nice feel about it.”</p>
    <p>Trader Jerico Quek vis­ited the store to look for a bi­cy­cle for his six-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Each cus­tomer was given a com­pli­men­tary bag.</p>
    <p>Be­ing able to test the bikes in store was one of the rea­sons why he chose to go to De­cathlon.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Orchard out­let did not have the bi­cy­cle they wanted, Quek, 39, said: “We have to get the right fit for her so we can’t buy the bike on­line. The prices of the bikes are also rea­son­able.</p>
    <p>“De­cathlon is a place where you can get sport­ing gear, at­tire, ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>“It’s the place where you come to get sport­ing gear.”</p>
    <p>De­cathlon Orchard is De­cathlon Sin­ga­pore’s fifth ex­pe­ri­ence store.</p>
