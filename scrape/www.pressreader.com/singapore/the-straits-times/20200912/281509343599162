    <p>Sin­ga­pore Post de­liv­ered a record vol­ume of e-com­merce pack­ages over the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, as store clo­sures forced con­sumers to shop on­line.</p>
    <p>To­gether, the postal ser­vice and courier arm Speed­post han­dled three mil­lion e-com­merce items in May, a 50 per cent in­crease over the same month last year, Mr Vin­cent Phang, SingPost’s Sin­ga­pore head and chief ex­ec­u­tive of postal ser­vices, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The re­open­ing of bricks-and-mor­tar stores has not led to a sig­nif­i­cant drop in de­liv­er­ies, in­di­cat­ing a per­ma­nent shift in con­sumer be­hav­iour that is ac­cel­er­at­ing the growth of e-com­merce in Sin­ga­pore, he said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has thus made the need to re­vamp the postal in­fra­struc­ture more ur­gent, he said.</p>
    <p>To kick-start this ef­fort, SingPost will be con­duct­ing a pub­lic trial of its smart let­ter­box sys­tem in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>In­stead of in­di­vid­ual let­ter­boxes, this sys­tem en­tails a cen­tral ma­chine that stores and dis­penses mail and small pack­ages.</p>
    <p>Items are sorted ac­cord­ing to size for more space ef­fi­ciency, and can be re­trieved through a touch screen on the ma­chine by pro­vid­ing a form of au­then­ti­ca­tion, such as scan­ning a QR code.</p>
    <p>Users may also re­ceive a no­ti­fi­ca­tion through a mo­bile app when items ar­rive.</p>
    <p>The trial will start with one neigh­bour­hood in the west and test the fea­si­bil­ity of re­plac­ing let­ter­box nests in the long run, Mr Phang said, adding that more de­tails will be an­nounced later.</p>
    <p>A pro­to­type was un­veiled last year, along with smart stamps that can al­low ba­sic mail items to be tracked, which will be tri­alled later.</p>
    <p>It is an op­por­tune time to test the smart let­ter­box sys­tem as de­mand for con­tact­less de­liv­er­ies has in­creased, Mr Phang noted.</p>
    <p>“And with the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, we think maybe us­ing a smart­phone to scan QR codes is quite a nor­mal thing these days,” he added.</p>
    <p>Postal sys­tems world­wide have been grap­pling with a de­cline in tra­di­tional mail and surge in larg­er­sized e-com­merce items even be­fore the pandemic.</p>
    <p>Many on­line pur­chases are sent through the mail, which is gen­er­ally cheaper than courier ser­vices.</p>
    <p>But when items can­not fit into a let­ter­box, the post­man must make a doorstep de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>In high-rise Sin­ga­pore, that takes an av­er­age of six min­utes, ver­sus six sec­onds for a let­ter­box de­liv­ery, Mr Phang said.</p>
    <p>“Given the labour-in­ten­sive na­ture of our work, if we don’t have this in­fra­struc­ture... there will be a lot more post­men in­volved and we have to think about how to sus­tain that,” he said.</p>
    <p>On whether SingPost’s vi­sion for the full roll-out of smart let­ter­boxes would en­tail one ma­chine per Hous­ing Board block and how costly that would be, he said these are some of the ques­tions that the pi­lot aims to shed light on.</p>
    <p>“Is this a vi­able piece of in­fra­struc­ture to get the ma­jor­ity of es­sen­tials de­liv­ered? Can it be the back­bone of an ur­ban lo­gis­tics de­liv­ery sys­tem? And if not, then (roll it out) where it mat­ters, by precincts and in a pro­gres­sive man­ner. That’s some of our think­ing.”</p>
    <p>Not hav­ing per­sonal let­ter­box units – and po­ten­tially hav­ing peo­ple walk fur­ther to the near­est smart let­ter­box to get their mail – will re­quire some ad­just­ment, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Why do you want to have a let­ter­box down­stairs? Be­cause you don’t know what’s com­ing”, which ne­ces­si­tates fre­quent checks, he said.</p>
    <p>But if there were no­ti­fi­ca­tions for mail ar­rivals, this would re­duce the num­ber of over­all trips to the let­ter­box, he sug­gested.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just about the tech­nol­ogy, but also the adapt­abil­ity and ac­cep­tance by the pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>Given the labour-in­ten­sive na­ture of our work, if we don’t have this in­fra­struc­ture... there will be a lot more post­men in­volved and we have to think about how to sus­tain that.</p>
