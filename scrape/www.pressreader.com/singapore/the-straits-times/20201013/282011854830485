    <p>In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion sec­ond-year stu­dent Joel Ho spent four hours ev­ery day from March to Septem­ber de­liv­er­ing food by bike to ease his fam­ily’s fi­nan­cial stress af­ter his fa­ther, a news­pa­per ven­dor, suf­fered a pay cut when the Covid-19 pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>Earn­ing around $30 to $40 a day, it was barely enough to help make ends meet for his fam­ily. But the 19-year-old’s bur­den will be eased now as he will be given fi­nan­cial sup­port un­der a $2 mil­lion fund launched yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fund seeks to pro­vide fi­nan­cial help to res­i­dents in the South East Dis­trict who have been hit hard by the pan­demic, and to raise aware­ness of men­tal health in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>It was set up by the South East Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil (CDC) and Apri­cot Cap­i­tal, the pri­vate i nvest­ment firm of Su­per Group’s Teo fam­ily.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of $1.2 mil­lion in grants will be dis­bursed to around 2,400 res­i­dents from low- to mid­dle-in­come house­holds through their grass­roots lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The South East CDC over­sees half a mil­lion res­i­dents in Marine Pa­rade GRC, East Coast GRC, Mount­bat­ten SMC and MacPher­son SMC.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate $320,000 will be given to stu­dents like Mr Ho as part of their pocket money for meals, sta­tionery and books. These in­clude stu­dents with spe­cial needs, as well as those in sec­ondary schools and in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other $100,000 will be used to pro­duce a play about men­tal well­ness which the CDC hopes will boost men­tal re­silience in youth and pro­mote sup­port net­works. The play will be screened for free at schools and in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing within the South East Dis­trict.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther $80,000 will be set aside for men­tal well­ness train­ing and work­shops to raise aware­ness of how peo­ple can sup­port pa­tients and their care­givers.</p>
    <p>Lastly, $300,000 will be used to cre­ate com­mu­nity at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple aged 18 to 35 who may have trou­ble find­ing em­ploy­ment amid the re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>With a monthly stipend of $1,000, they will be guided by grass­roots lead­ers to iden­tify prob­lems in the com­mu­nity and roll out projects to solve them.</p>
    <p>Mayor of South East Dis­trict Fahmi Ali­man said the Apri­cot sup­port for the fund is timely and will ben­e­fit many groups within the com­mu­nity. “South East CDC will work with our ground part­ners to con­nect them to the as­sis­tance they re­quire,” he said.</p>
