    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Se­nate Democrats have un­veiled a re­port that is highly crit­i­cal of US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo’s man­age­ment of the State De­part­ment, two days be­fore he is set to tes­tify on Capi­tol Hill.</p>
    <p>The 46-page re­port, is­sued on Tues­day and pro­duced by Demo­cratic staff on the Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee, says Mr Pom­peo’s de­part­ment is rife with what it de­scribes as trou­bling is­sues: va­cant key de­part­ment posts, a cul­ture of dis­re­spect to­wards ca­reer staff and an at­mos­phere of po­lit­i­cal re­tal­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Democrats say this has ham­pered the agency’s ef­fec­tive­ness in pur­su­ing diplo­matic re­la­tion­ships abroad or re­spond­ing to crises like the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent (Don­ald) Trump and Sec­re­tary Pom­peo have left the de­part­ment dec­i­mated and de­mor­alised,” said Sen­a­tor Bob Me­nen­dez of New Jer­sey, the com­mit­tee’s top Demo­crat.</p>
    <p>“This is not a bureau­cratic or in­side-the-Belt­way is­sue. There are real con­se­quences for the United States and our na­tional se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>The re­port most likely previews at­tacks that Demo­cratic sen­a­tors will make against Mr Pom­peo to­day, when he tes­ti­fies be­fore the com­mit­tee on his de­part­ment’s bud­get re­quest for fis­cal 2021.</p>
    <p>It will be his first pub­lic ap­pear­ance on Capi­tol Hill since com­ing un­der scru­tiny for pri­vately urg­ing Mr Trump to fire State De­part­ment in­spec­tor-gen­eral Steve Linick, who was re­moved in May af­ter open­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions into Mr Pom­peo’s po­ten­tial mis­use of de­part­ment re­sources and his ef­fort to push arms sales to Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>A State De­part­ment spokesman de­nied the re­port’s con­clu­sions and said Mr Pom­peo had suc­cess­fully en­acted the for­eign pol­icy goals of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, work­ing to ad­vance the in­ter­ests of the US around the world.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Democrats said in the re­port that the White House and Mr Pom­peo had not nom­i­nated enough qual­i­fied can­di­dates to key State De­part­ment posts, not­ing that 11 as­sis­tant sec­re­tary or un­der­sec­re­tary po­si­tions are va­cant or filled by act­ing of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>“Va­can­cies and act­ing posts have had se­ri­ous ram­i­fi­ca­tions for Amer­ica’s pres­ence in the world, its overseas op­er­a­tions and for US na­tional se­cu­rity,” the re­port says.</p>
    <p>“The lack of se­nior de­part­ment of­fi­cials and per­son­nel at­tri­tion lev­els doesn’t just mean empty desks.</p>
    <p>It trans­lates to a lack of US lead­er­ship on the global stage.”</p>
    <p>De­part­ment of­fi­cials have in turn blamed Democrats in the Se­nate for the va­can­cies, say­ing sen­a­tors have not con­sid­ered, and even ob­structed, can­di­dates for con­fir­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Democrats have coun­tered by say­ing they have ap­proved over 160 nominees for con­fir­ma­tion, but have de­nied some be­cause some can­di­dates put for­ward by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion mis­rep­re­sented their qual­i­fi­ca­tions or had a his­tory of racist and of­fen­sive com­ments.</p>
    <p>The re­port also an­a­lysed data from a 2019 fed­eral em­ployee sur­vey. It found that 53 per cent of re­spon­dents in the de­part­ment’s in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tion bureau said po­lit­i­cal co­er­cion was tol­er­ated, up from 24 per cent in 2016; while 34 per cent in its le­gal bureau felt de­part­ment lead­er­ship did not have high lev­els of hon­esty or in­tegrity, an in­crease from 0 per cent in 2016.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Democrats also used the re­port to high­light a cul­ture of fear and mis­trust that ca­reer de­part­ment staff feel to­wards po­lit­i­cal ap­pointees un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>They pointed to re­ports of a se­nior ad­viser in the de­part­ment’s in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tion bureau com­pil­ing “loy­alty lists” af­ter Mr Pom­peo be­came sec­re­tary.</p>
