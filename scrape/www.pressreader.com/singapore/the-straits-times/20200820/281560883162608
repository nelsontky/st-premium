    <p>A group formed to aid bars hit by the pan­demic has raised $120,000 to help up to 240 af­fected bar staff. El­i­gi­ble bar em­ploy­ees whose monthly pay is $3,400 or less can each get up to $500 in re­lief. The Sin­ga­pore Cock­tail Bar As­so­ci­a­tion said half of the amount came from cor­po­rate spon­sors, with the rest matched by the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>A group formed to help bars hit by the pan­demic has raised $120,000 to help up to 240 af­fected bar staff.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble bar em­ploy­ees whose monthly pay is $3,400 or less can each get up to $500 in re­lief.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Cock­tail Bar As­so­ci­a­tion (SCBA) made the an­nounce­ment in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It said $60,000 of the funds were raised from cor­po­rate spon­sors, with the rest matched by the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) Foun­da­tion via its $2 mil­lion Com­pas­sion Fund to help busi­nesses tide over Covid-19 chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions to the SCBA-SBF</p>
    <p>Foun­da­tion Com­pas­sion Fund are lim­ited to Sin­ga­pore­ans, per­ma­nent res­i­dents and work-pass hold­ers cur­rently or pre­vi­ously em­ployed by SCBA’s 54 mem­ber bars. The bars com­prise cock­tail bars, res­tau­rant bars and spirit bars.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble ap­pli­cants are those who have lost their jobs; tran­sit­ing be­tween em­ploy­ers within the cock­tail in­dus­try; or have had their salary cut by 30 per cent or more be­tween April 1 and June 30.</p>
    <p>The SCBA is also rais­ing funds for two more rounds of re­liefs by the end of this month, to sup­port mem­ber bars through the New Bar Sup­port Fund – which aims to of­fer a month of ren­tal re­lief to bars less than a year old – as well as the In­dus­try Re­cov­ery Fund.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter aims to sup­port bars that have had to pivot their busi­ness, by pro­vid­ing ac­cess to ser­vices – capped at $1,000 – from com­pa­nies in the fields of de­sign, public re­la­tions and pho­tog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>Bars here have been hit hard by so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lish­ments with bar li­cences re­mained closed, while those with res­tau­rant li­cences have re­opened but have had to dras­ti­cally re­duce their ca­pac­ity, and shorten their op­er­a­tion hours to abide by the 10.30pm clos­ing time.</p>
    <p>The SCBA, formed in April, is led by found­ing pres­i­dent Gan Guoyi (co-owner of Jig­ger & Pony Group), vice-pres­i­dent Vi­vian Pei (acad­emy chair for Asia’s 50 Best Bars) and trea­surer An­drew Yap (co-owner of The Old Man Sin­ga­pore), along­side found­ing board mem­bers Paul Ga­bie (chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Proof & Com­pany and di­rec­tor of 28 HongKong Street) and Ivy Woo (owner of Food News In­te­grated Mar­ket­ing and co-founder of the Sin­ga­pore Cock­tail Fes­ti­val).</p>
    <p>Other mem­bers in­clude rep­re­sen­ta­tives from spir­its brands and cock­tail bars.</p>
