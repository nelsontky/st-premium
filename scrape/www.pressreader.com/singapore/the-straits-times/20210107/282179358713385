    <p>The Work­ers’ Party (WP) has ap­pointed new of­fice bear­ers af­ter its top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body met on Tues­day, with its younger mem­bers tak­ing on new re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the ap­point­ments yes­ter­day, the WP said Sengkang GRC MP He Ting Ru, 37, and Mr Ken­neth Foo, 43, who ran as a can­di­date in East Coast GRC in last year’s gen­eral elec­tion, are deputy or­gan­is­ing sec­re­taries in its Cen­tral Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mit­tee (CEC).</p>
    <p>There was pre­vi­ously just one deputy or­gan­is­ing sec­re­tary, and the post was held by Ms He’s hus­band, Mr Ter­ence Tan, who is no longer a CEC mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Ms Raeesah Khan, 27, also an MP for Sengkang GRC, took over as deputy trea­surer from Ms Lee Li Lian, who has stepped down from the CEC.</p>
    <p>Alju­nied GRC MP Leon Per­era, 50, will head the WP’s me­dia team af­ter pre­vi­ously serv­ing as the team’s deputy chair, and pres­i­dent of the party’s youth wing. He re­placed former Non-Con­stituency MP Daniel Goh, the pre­vi­ous me­dia team head.</p>
    <p>Sengkang GRC MP Louis Chua, 33, took over as deputy head of the me­dia team, while East Coast GRC can­di­date Ni­cole Seah, 34, is now youth wing pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The party cre­ated two new CEC po­si­tions, with Alju­nied GRC MP Ger­ald Giam tak­ing on the post of pol­icy re­search team head, and</p>
    <p>Sengkang GRC MP Ja­mus Lim, 44, be­ing ap­pointed its deputy head.</p>
    <p>Mr Giam, 43, also re­tained his post as party trea­surer.</p>
    <p>Other po­si­tions in the CEC re­main un­changed, with Alju­nied GRC MP Faisal Manap, 45, re­turn­ing as vice-chair­man and Hougang MP Den­nis Tan, 50, re­turn­ing as or­gan­is­ing sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>Former party leader Low Thia Khi­ang, 64, and former Hougang MP Png Eng Huat, 59, re­main mem­bers of the CEC.</p>
    <p>WP sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pri­tam Singh, 44, and party chair­man Sylvia Lim, 55, were both re-elected to their posts un­op­posed at the party’s in­ter­nal elec­tion on Dec 27.</p>
