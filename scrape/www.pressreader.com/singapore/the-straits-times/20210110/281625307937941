    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion of this un­hinged Pres­i­dent could not be more dan­ger­ous, and we must do ev­ery­thing that we can to pro­tect the Amer­i­can people from his un­bal­anced as­sault on our coun­try and our democ­racy.”</p>
    <p>SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI, in a let­ter to Demo­cratic law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Democrats are mov­ing rapidly to im­peach Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump for in­cit­ing his sup­port­ers to storm the Capi­tol on Wed­nes­day, with me­dia out­lets re­port­ing that for­mal pro­ceed­ings could be launched as soon as Mon­day.</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump does not “im­me­di­ately re­sign”, the House will move for­ward with a mo­tion for im­peach­ment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a state­ment on Fri­day – with 12 days left to go un­til the end of Mr Trump’s term.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can-con­trolled Se­nate is un­likely to vote to con­vict Mr Trump, a feat that would be lo­gis­ti­cally and po­lit­i­cally dif­fi­cult. The White House, and some Repub­li­cans, are also ar­gu­ing that im­peach­ment would fur­ther di­vide an al­ready po­larised Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Im­peach­ment has a high chance of pass­ing in the Demo­crat-con­trolled House, with some Repub­li­cans re­port­edly open to join­ing the ef­fort, mak­ing this the sec­ond time Mr Trump will be im­peached.</p>
    <p>He was im­peached in De­cem­ber 2019 in the House for abuse of power and ob­struc­tion of Congress, but ac­quit­ted by the Repub­li­can-ma­jor­ity Se­nate.</p>
    <p>As with last time, the Se­nate is un­likely to vote to re­move him from of­fice, a move that would dis­qual­ify him from hold­ing of­fice again.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­ti­cally, there may not be enough time for the Se­nate to hold a trial. Po­lit­i­cally, vot­ing to con­vict him could hurt vul­ner­a­ble Repub­li­cans up for re-elec­tion in 2022.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, more Repub­li­cans ap­pear re­cep­tive to im­peach­ing and con­vict­ing Mr Trump than be­fore. Alaska Sen­a­tor Lisa Murkowski, one of the party’s more mod­er­ate voices, be­came the first Repub­li­can sen­a­tor to call for his res­ig­na­tion on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“I want him to re­sign. I want him out. He has caused enough dam­age,” she told the An­chor­age Daily News in an in­ter­view on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence told Mr Trump he did not have the con­sti­tu­tional au­thor­ity to over­turn states’ elec­toral votes, Mr Trump “still told his sup­port­ers to fight”, she said.</p>
    <p>“How are they sup­posed to take that? It’s an or­der from the Pres­i­dent. And so that’s what they did,” Ms Murkowsi said, adding that she might be ques­tion­ing whether to re­main a Repub­li­can.</p>
    <p>Ne­braska Sen­a­tor Ben Sasse told CBS in a Fri­day in­ter­view that he would “def­i­nitely con­sider” po­ten­tial ar­ti­cles of im­peach­ment, but said the ques­tion was whether im­peach­ment would be pru­dent for the fu­ture of the United States.</p>
    <p>The im­peach­ment ef­fort faces push­back from other Repub­li­cans, in­clud­ing some who voted against an at­tempt by their col­leagues to over­turn Mr Joe Bi­den’s elec­toral vic­tory in Congress last week, who say that im­peach­ment would be too di­vi­sive.</p>
    <p>South Carolina Sen­a­tor Lind­sey Gra­ham, a Trump ally who dis­tanced him­self from the Pres­i­dent last week, wrote on Twit­ter that im­peach­ment would “do more harm than good” and “fur­ther di­vide the coun­try and erode the in­sti­tu­tion of the pres­i­dency it­self”.</p>
    <p>House Mi­nor­ity Leader Kevin McCarthy sim­i­larly said in a state­ment: “Im­peach­ing the Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>with just 12 days left in his term will only di­vide our coun­try more.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Fri­day, the White House said: “As Pres­i­dent Trump said yes­ter­day, this is a time for heal­ing and unity as one na­tion. A po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated im­peach­ment against a Pres­i­dent with 12 days re­main­ing in his term will only serve to fur­ther di­vide our great coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den de­clined to take sides dur­ing an event in Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware on Fri­day. He said: “What the Congress de­cides to do is for them to de­cide.”</p>
