    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som has de­clared a state of emer­gency in three coun­ties be­cause of the Glass and Zogg fires that have claimed three lives and burned thou­sands of hectares in the state since Sunday.</p>
    <p>The coun­ties are Napa, Sonoma and Shasta, the gov­er­nor’s of­fice said in a state­ment late on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor New­som also sent a let­ter to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump via the Fed­eral Emer­gency Man­age­ment Agency, re­quest­ing him to de­clare a ma­jor dis­as­ter, which would strengthen re­sponse to fires across the state, the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>The dec­la­ra­tion is meant to as­sist state and lo­cal wild­fire re­sponse and re­cov­ery ef­forts in Fresno, Los An­ge­les, Madera, Men­do­cino, San Bernardino, San Diego and Siskiyou coun­ties.</p>
    <p>The re­quest comes after the deadly Zogg fire de­stroyed 146 struc­tures and charred 12,545 hectares in Shasta county and co­in­cided with the out­break of another con­fla­gra­tion in the heart of Cal­i­for­nia’s wine coun­try north of the Bay Area in San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>That blaze, dubbed the Glass Fire, has spread across 14,568 hectares of sim­i­lar ter­rain in Napa and Sonoma coun­ties – both famed wine-pro­duc­ing re­gions – since early Sunday.</p>
    <p>Three fa­tal­i­ties – all civil­ians – were re­ported in the Zogg Fire by the county sher­iff and the Cal­i­for­nia Depart­ment of Forestry and Fire Pro­tec­tion (CalFire). The blaze erupted on Sunday near Red­ding, about 320km north of San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>No fur­ther de­tails about the vic­tims or how they per­ished were im­me­di­ately pro­vided. But the deaths bring to 29 the num­ber of peo­ple killed since the mid­dle of Au­gust in a Cal­i­for­nia wild­fire sea­son of his­toric pro­por­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Glass Fire has in­cin­er­ated more than 100 homes and other build­ings, forc­ing thou­sands of res­i­dents to flee and threat­en­ing world-renowned vine­yards, ac­cord­ing to CalFire.</p>
    <p>They marked the l at­est flash points in a de­struc­tive spate of wild­fires this sum­mer across the west coast of the United States.</p>
    <p>Both fires were listed at zero con­tain­ment as of Mon­day evening. The cause of each was un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia this year, wild­fires have scorched 1.5 mil­lion hectares since Jan­uary – far ex­ceed­ing any sin­gle year in state history.</p>
    <p>They have been stoked by in­tense, pro­longed bouts of heat, high winds and other weather ex­tremes that sci­en­tists at­tribute to cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>More than 7,000 homes and other struc­tures have burned statewide so far this year.</p>
    <p>Over 100,000 homes and busi­ness have suf­fered power out­ages across north­ern Cal­i­for­nia since Sunday, some from pre­cau­tion­ary shut­offs of trans­mis­sion lines to re­duce wild­fire risks in the midst of ex­tremely windy, hot, dry weather, Pa­cific Gas and Elec­tric re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, red-flag warn­ings for ex­treme wild­fire risks re­mained posted for much of North­ern Cal­i­for­nia, fore­cast­ing low hu­mid­ity and gale-force wind gusts.</p>
