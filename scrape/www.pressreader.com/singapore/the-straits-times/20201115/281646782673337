    <p>Sin­ga­pore hopes that the United States will fur­ther broaden and deepen its pres­ence in this re­gion, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day, high­light­ing po­lit­i­cal and se­cu­rity is­sues, and econ­omy as key ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the 8th Asean-US Sum­mit, PM Lee said the US has been a vi­tal part­ner for Asean since the end of the sec­ond World War, and thanked it for its sup­port to the re­gion dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual sum­mit was at­tended by US na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Robert O’Brien, who rep­re­sented Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the ses­sion, PM Lee said Sin­ga­pore hopes that the US will fur­ther broaden and deepen its pres­ence in this re­gion, and wel­comes the US’ con­tin­ued se­cu­rity pres­ence in Asia.</p>
    <p>He said the Repub­lic ap­pre­ci­ates Amer­i­can sup­port for the Asean Out­look on the Indo-Pa­cific, which is the bloc’s plan to de­velop the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>He also noted that op­er­a­tions of the US’ Sev­enth Fleet help strengthen re­gional se­cu­rity and safe­guard the rights of re­gional coun­tries un­der in­ter­na­tional law, such as the United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea.</p>
    <p>“We also hope to con­tinue to work with the US to up­hold the rules-based in­ter­na­tional or­der, in­clud­ing by sup­port­ing mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions, and find­ing mul­ti­lat­eral so­lu­tions to global chal­lenges like cli­mate change and pan­demics,” he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also high­lighted the strength­en­ing of Asean-US eco­nomic ties, by pro­tect­ing sup­ply chains, main­tain­ing open and unim­peded trade flows, and safely re­sum­ing global travel.</p>
    <p>“This would ben­e­fit many US com­pa­nies which have long­stand­ing business in­ter­ests here,” he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee called for the US to con­tinue sup­port­ing Asean’s ef­forts to deepen eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion with part­ners, such as through the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship to be signed to­day, and the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship which was signed al­most three years back.</p>
    <p>“There is much strate­gic value to strength­en­ing eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion. It gives us a larger mu­tual stake in one an­other’s growth and well-be­ing, and will help sus­tain the Asia-Pa­cific as an oa­sis of sta­bil­ity and pros­per­ity for many years to come,” he said.</p>
    <p>In his speech, PM Lee also said that the long­stand­ing US pres­ence in the re­gion has cre­ated a sta­ble and con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for peace and sta­bil­ity, fos­ter­ing re­gional pros­per­ity and al­low­ing coun­tries to con­cen­trate on eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>This has re­sulted in the eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship be­tween Asean and the US grow­ing steadily over the years, with mu­tual growth and ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>The stock of Amer­i­can in­vest­ments in this re­gion is now US$329 bil­lion (S$443 bil­lion) – ex­ceed­ing the amount in China, In­dia, Ja­pan and South Korea com­bined.</p>
    <p>“Many Amer­i­can com­pa­nies are house­hold names in Asean. Even in some of the most re­mote ar­eas in our re­gion, you can find Coca-Cola and Col­gate,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>He said Sin­ga­pore strongly wel­comes the US’ con­tin­ued en­gage­ment in the re­gion, such as through the Asia Re­as­sur­ance Ini­tia­tive Act, which will pro­vide US$1.5 bil­lion to the Asia-Pa­cific yearly for five years.</p>
    <p>“We ap­pre­ci­ate that dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, the US has been a sup­port­ive part­ner, pro­vid­ing fi­nan­cial and tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance to Asean mem­ber states,” PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>In his open­ing re­marks, Mr O’Brien said: “At this time of global cri­sis, the US-Asean strate­gic part­ner­ship has be­come even more im­por­tant as we work to­gether to com­bat the coro­n­avirus.”</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged Asean’s ef­forts in keep­ing key sup­ply chains open, no­tably the flow of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>There was dis­ap­point­ment from some quar­ters that the US once again lacked high-level rep­re­sen­ta­tion at the sum­mit.</p>
    <p>The US-Asean Business Coun­cil noted that Mr Trump had par­tic­i­pated only once back in 2017, and has sent a rep­re­sen­ta­tive ev­ery year since.</p>
