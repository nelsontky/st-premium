    <p>GER­MANY</p>
    <p>Un­der new rules en­forced yes­ter­day, bars and restau­rants will close at 11pm in Ber­lin un­til Oct 31 in a par­tial cur­few, a mea­sure al­ready im­posed – but start­ing an hour ear­lier – in the fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal Frank­furt.</p>
    <p>The shut­down in the Ger­man cap­i­tal – which has more than 400 new cases daily – also cov­ers all shops ex­cept phar­ma­cies and petrol sta­tions, although they will be banned from sell­ing al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>SPAIN</p>
    <p>The govern­ment de­clared a state of emer­gency and a new par­tial lock­down for Madrid on Fri­day, as it faced in­creas­ing pub­lic re­sis­tance to anti-virus mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple were barred from leav­ing the city ex­cept for work, school or med­i­cal rea­sons, mea­sures de­nounced by the city’s right-wing au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants in Madrid were or­dered to stop serv­ing af­ter 10pm, and to close by 11pm – when many peo­ple are just con­sid­er­ing sit­ting down to eat.</p>
    <p>FRANCE</p>
    <p>The French govern­ment last month shut bars and restau­rants in the south­ern port city of Mar­seille, pro­vok­ing the fury of lo­cal of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Par­tial shut­downs have since been ex­tended to Paris and other ma­jor ur­ban ar­eas, and another four French cities were placed on max­i­mum coro­n­avirus alert on Thurs­day, with bars or­dered closed and pub­lic gath­er­ings lim­ited.</p>
    <p>BRI­TAIN</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son is ex­pected to out­line to­mor­row a new three-tier lock­down regime.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ties Sec­re­tary Robert Jen­rick said on BBC Ra­dio that the new ap­proach would of­fer “sim­ple na­tional rules” to tighten re­stric­tions where needed, “but then also greater free­dom for those lo­cal ar­eas to de­sign fur­ther mea­sures” in part­ner­ship with White­hall.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ur­ban cen­tres in north­ern Eng­land have been hit with a range of curbs on so­cial life such as a ban on dif­fer­ent house­holds mix­ing.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool City Re­gion mayor Steve Rotheram said the govern­ment had in­formed him that his conur­ba­tion of 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple was set to en­ter tier-three lock­down from Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The high­est tier three level of lock­down for Eng­land is ex­pected to go be­yond ex­ist­ing re­stric­tions such as a cur­few for pubs, and close hos­pi­tal­ity venues al­to­gether, sim­i­lar to mea­sures en­acted in re­cent days else­where in Europe. No so­cial con­tact would be al­lowed out­side a per­son’s own house­hold, in­clud­ing out­doors.</p>
