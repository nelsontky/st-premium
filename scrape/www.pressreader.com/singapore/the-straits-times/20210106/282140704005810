    <p>Since March 2019, more than 200 peo­ple have been trained to pro­vide ba­sic mar­riage sup­port to couples as part of gov­ern­ment ef­forts to strengthen marriages.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Family Devel­op­ment Sun Xuel­ing yes­ter­day said 215 com­mu­nity lead­ers, re­li­gious lead­ers and mar­riage solem­nis­ers have been trained as Mar­i­tal First Re­spon­ders who can step in early be­fore mat­ters take a turn for the worse.</p>
    <p>More such re­spon­ders will con­tinue to be trained, she said, adding that the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to work with so­cial ser­vice agen­cies and com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions to of­fer more mar­riage en­rich­ment pro­grammes for couples to strengthen their re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>She was re­spond­ing to Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas) on a study about the in­ter-gen­er­a­tional ef­fects of di­vorce on chil­dren in Sin­ga­pore that the Min­istry of So­cial and Family Devel­op­ment re­leased last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong had asked if there were sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ences in the out­comes for chil­dren based on the age of the child when the par­ents got di­vorced.</p>
    <p>He also wanted to know the min­istry’s next steps in ex­am­in­ing the is­sue of a “di­vorce penalty” on chil­dren and study­ing the ef­fi­cacy of in­ter­ven­tions to re­duce its ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said it is im­por­tant in di­vorce cases to fo­cus more ef­forts on early child­hood in­ter­ven­tion, not only to mit­i­gate the po­ten­tial neg­a­tive ef­fects but also to en­hance the pos­i­tive devel­op­ment of the child.</p>
    <p>“This in­ter­ven­tion ef­fort should be based on rig­or­ous ev­i­dence from the so­cial and be­havioural sciences, and for it to work, we will need good poli­cies and the help from ex­perts but also the sup­port from fam­i­lies, com­mu­ni­ties and in­deed a whole-of-so­ci­ety ap­proach,” she added.</p>
    <p>She said the min­istry will con­tinue to re­view par­ent­ing pro­grammes that di­vorc­ing couples have to go through, to en­hance their ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>The min­istry is also look­ing into how it can en­cour­age more di­vorced par­ents to en­rol them­selves and their chil­dren in the Chil­dren in Be­tween pro­gramme, run by di­vorce sup­port spe­cial­ist agen­cies, that equips chil­dren with skills to man­age their feel­ings and de­velop re­silience.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun noted that it is also im­por­tant to in­crease up­stream ef­forts to strengthen marriages, like step­ping up ef­forts to en­cour­age couples to un­dergo mar­riage prepa­ra­tion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­rie Tan (Nee Soon GRC) asked about the min­istry’s in­ten­tion and mo­ti­va­tion in pub­lish­ing the study’s re­sults “in a man­ner that un­for­tu­nately I think cre­ates the un­in­tended fur­ther stig­ma­tis­ing of di­vorcees... or maybe po­ten­tially guilt-trip­ping them, and also the un­for­tu­nate la­belling of chil­dren from di­vorced fam­i­lies”.</p>
    <p>“This makes it harder for couples who are al­ready con­sid­er­ing di­vorce due to very dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances in their mar­riage be­cause then they worry about these out­comes which they al­ready worry about and it doesn’t help them in their con­sid­er­a­tion process,” she said.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Ms Sun said: “There are im­por­tant ob­ser­va­tions that can be made from this data, and we wanted to share it with prac­ti­tion­ers, with fam­i­lies, so that they un­der­stand what the data presents.”</p>
    <p>In some in­stances, di­vorce may well be the best way out for a mar­ried cou­ple, she noted.</p>
    <p>“And if that’s the case, and if there are young, mi­nor chil­dren in­volved, how best do we mit­i­gate the im­pact of di­vorces on these chil­dren? That is the in­tent and the spirit of this study.”</p>
