    <p>By the end of this year, trav­ellers fly­ing on bud­get car­rier Scoot will be able to shop for duty-free items, play games and or­der food on their phones by just scan­ning a QR code.</p>
    <p>This will re­duce sur­face con­tact and phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tions be­tween cabin crew and pas­sen­gers, the car­rier said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The launch of the mo­bile por­tal for use dur­ing flights is sim­i­lar to what par­ent com­pany Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has done as both car­ri­ers seek to re­as­sure cus­tomers that it is safe to take to the skies again amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Scoot said the por­tal, named ScootHub, will al­low it to re­sume some ser­vices that were sus­pended fol­low­ing the pan­demic. These in­cluded the pur­chase of food and duty-free shop­ping dur­ing flights.</p>
    <p>By next April, the por­tal will be up­graded to let pas­sen­gers book tick­ets to at­trac­tions and other ex­pe­ri­ences. They do not have to pur­chase any Wi-Fi con­nec­tion to use it.</p>
    <p>Scoot chief ex­ec­u­tive Camp­bell Wil­son said: “I think all of us in the travel in­dus­try have been a bit com­pla­cent and we have made the cus­tomer go through a lot of un­nec­es­sary touch­points. This is a good op­por­tu­nity for us all to try to make the process smoother.”</p>
    <p>Scoot will also tap the por­tal to gen­er­ate ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­son, who was speak­ing at</p>
    <p>a me­dia event at Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 1, also ad­dressed sev­eral ques­tions about the fu­ture of the air­line and air travel.</p>
    <p>He said Scoot had gone “through the worst” of the pan­demic and had grad­u­ally re­stored its net­work.</p>
    <p>“We think that the fu­ture world, at least in the medium term, is con­ducive to low-cost car­ri­ers,” he said, cit­ing fac­tors such as the ex­pected faster re­cov­ery of leisure travel and trav­ellers’ pref­er­ence for lower fares.</p>
    <p>He also said that Scoot would not push for a pol­icy in which only trav­ellers vac­ci­nated against Covid-19 were al­lowed on its planes. He was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on a pro­posal by Aus­tralian car­rier Qan­tas.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­son also said some changes prompted by the pan­demic – such as the in­creased use of tech­nol­ogy to re­duce touch­points – would be the new nor­mal even af­ter wide­spread vac­ci­na­tion against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple’s de­sire to travel, how­ever, would not change, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple’s mo­ti­va­tions for travel are deep and in­her­ent, and I think it is a func­tion of hu­man na­ture,” he said. “I think the appreciati­on of the abil­ity to travel is go­ing to be much im­proved... I have ab­so­lute con­fi­dence that we are not go­ing to get back to where we were be­fore but we will sur­pass it.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Scoot pas&#xAD;sen&#xAD;gers will soon be able to use their mo&#xAD;bile phones to ac&#xAD;cess an in-flight por&#xAD;tal (above) by scan&#xAD;ning a QR code pasted on the back of ev&#xAD;ery seat. The por&#xAD;tal will al&#xAD;low the car&#xAD;rier to re&#xAD;duce con&#xAD;tact be&#xAD;tween crew and pas&#xAD;sen&#xAD;gers, which in turn lets it re&#xAD;sume ser&#xAD;vices like in-flight din&#xAD;ing (be&#xAD;low).</p>
