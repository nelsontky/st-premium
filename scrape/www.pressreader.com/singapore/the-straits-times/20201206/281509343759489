    <p>Six­teen years ago, I cov­ered the sales launch of Sin­ga­pore’s posh­est pub­lic hous­ing project.</p>
    <p>It was like cover­ing a rock con­cert. The fans were 20-some­things, clutch­ing glossy brochures. The star was The Pin­na­cle@Dux­ton, the Hous­ing Board’s new sky­scraper project along Can­ton­ment Road.</p>
    <p>The as­pir­ing home buy­ers came, at­tracted by the HDB’s TV commercial­s of a lithe fe­male model run­ning through a sky gar­den, and al­lu­sions to “trendy wa­ter­ing holes and pubs” nearby. The tagline, Peak of City Liv­ing, whis­pered of a life­style that tran­scended the project’s pub­lic hous­ing roots.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the unan­i­mous feed­back from the peo­ple I in­ter­viewed that day was that the Pin­na­cle looked noth­ing like an HDB de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>By the end of that day, there were 637 ap­pli­ca­tions for the 528 units avail­able in the first phase. By the end of the first week, there were 2,085 ap­pli­ca­tions, even­tu­ally reach­ing 3,149.</p>
    <p>So over­whelm­ing was the re­sponse that the HDB re­leased all 1,848 units in the seven 50-storey blocks for im­me­di­ate sale. Some 5,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans put their names down, and one-third of them scored a home – and more.</p>
    <p>In the fol­low­ing months, there was some angst about the</p>
    <p>Pin­na­cle. Pri­vate de­vel­op­ers felt threatened by the HDB’s seem­ingly muscling in on to their turf with lower-priced condo-like flats in the city. Some an­a­lysts won­dered why pub­lic funds were used to ag­gres­sively mar­ket the project.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the con­cerns, then Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Mah Bow Tan de­clared the Pin­na­cle to be a one-off down­town project, to mark the first pub­lic hous­ing blocks built in the area.</p>
    <p>The Pin­na­cle has since be­come a poster boy for the heights – lit­eral and metaphor­i­cal – that pub­lic hous­ing can reach; a des­ti­na­tion for overseas gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, tourists and lo­cal in­vestors.</p>
    <p>It has also be­come the most recog­nis­able face of the so-called HDB lottery ef­fect.</p>
    <p>To­day, units are chang­ing hands at prices as high as $1.2 mil­lion – up to four times the $289,200 to $439,400 that the orig­i­nal own­ers had paid. Those who choose not to sell af­ter the min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod (MOP) of five years can en­joy a tidy monthly sum from rent­ing out their units.</p>
    <p>Not un­ex­pect­edly, this has stirred up no small amount of envy, and grouses, about why this lucky group of home­own­ers should get to make such prof­its from a tax­payer-sub­sidised good. There are mur­murs about the in­equity of it all.</p>
    <p>But, to me, the Pin­na­cle – be­ing a rare city de­vel­op­ment – is a red herring.</p>
    <p>The big­ger con­cern is the HDB projects scat­tered in ma­ture es­tates across Sin­ga­pore that look like reg­u­lar HDB homes – and yet are at risk of re­main­ing out of reach for some.</p>
    <p>EVERY FLAT A GOOD FLAT BUT SOME ARE GOLDMINES</p>
    <p>Every town in Sin­ga­pore is, un­doubt­edly, a good town.</p>
    <p>Our ur­ban plan­ners en­sure a base­line of pub­lic ameni­ties across the is­land.</p>
    <p>Yet, there re­main de­vi­a­tions in ex­pe­ri­ences and life­styles.</p>
    <p>I have lived in three dif­fer­ent es­tates across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>I was born in Toa Payoh where my grand­par­ents paid $7,800 in cash for a three-room flat in</p>
    <p>Block 126. My par­ents started their fam­ily in a one-room ren­tal flat in Block 141, then moved to a three-room flat in Block 79, and later a four-room flat in Block 191.</p>
    <p>Back then, in the 1970s and 1980s, Toa Payoh bloomed as Sin­ga­pore’s first HDB-planned new town.</p>
    <p>We en­joyed the ameni­ties that came with be­ing part of a pioneer­ing mis­sion: the first MRT sta­tion and the first air-con­di­tioned NTUC FairPrice su­per­mar­ket. We had es­tab­lished schools, a full-fledged pub­lic li­brary, hawker cen­tres, rest­ful places of wor­ship, shops and a foun­tain with lit-up jets of wa­ter.</p>
    <p>From this most ma­ture of ma­ture es­tates, my fam­ily moved in 1999 to the new­est kid on the block,</p>
    <p>Yew Tee. The then fledg­ling satel­lite neigh­bour­hood of Choa Chu Kang is in the far-flung north-western nook of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>My fond­ness for Yew Tee would emerge later – partly due to the ef­forts of plan­ners and grass­roots lead­ers to make it lov­able, and partly due to per­sonal mem­o­ries and con­nec­tions forged.</p>
    <p>But for a long while, it felt bereft of ameni­ties, and de­void of a soul.</p>
    <p>On sul­try week­day evenings as I walked home past the empty void decks of HDB blocks, the si­lence was deaf­en­ing. Un­like in ma­ture es­tates, no heart­land shops dot­ted the way; there were no clus­ters of chat­ter­ing res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>There were rail tracks right out­side our home all right, but these were the rusty metal teeth on which the KTM trains rat­tled to and from Jo­hor Baru, be­fore they were si­lenced in 2011.</p>
    <p>Af­ter I got mar­ried in 2009, my hus­band and I moved to a walk-up apart­ment in Siglap to be near his par­ents. Siglap has good food, good schools and easy ac­cess to East Coast Park’s beaches and park con­nec­tors. But it has no af­ford­able hous­ing op­tions for HDB dwellers.</p>
    <p>In our ear­lier years there, it boasted just four low-rise blocks of HDB res­i­dents who lived in a mix of owned and ren­tal two-room flats. But even they dis­ap­peared when the blocks came un­der the HDB’s Se­lec­tive En-bloc Re­de­vel­op­ment Scheme.</p>
    <p>The blocks have stood va­cant for five years now.</p>
    <p>Next to us is Ma­rine Pa­rade, which has its fair share of HDB blocks.</p>
    <p>But these also have a cer­tain so­cio-eco­nomic makeup. While the first-gen­er­a­tion res­i­dents spanned the in­come spec­trum, many of the younger and newer denizens are those who can af­ford the high re­sale prices of Ma­rine Pa­rade flats – driven largely by the prox­im­ity of brand-name schools and the vaunted sea­side vibe.</p>
    <p>And in time to come – per­haps when their chil­dren move on to other schools – they can choose to sell their flats at even higher prices.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty agents call these HDB flats “goldmines”.</p>
    <p>IN­CLU­SIVE­NESS AND DI­VER­SITY</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to press ahead with tack­ling in­equal­ity and so­cial strat­i­fi­ca­tion, cer­tain pub­lic hous­ing poli­cies could do with a relook.</p>
    <p>Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee sent an im­por­tant sig­nal last week when he said that steps will be taken to en­sure that prime hous­ing es­tates will not just be en­claves for the rich.</p>
    <p>It is an is­sue about “in­clu­sive­ness and di­ver­sity”, when HDB flats in “high-end” dis­tricts are resold for a wind­fall af­ter the MOP, Mr Lee said in an in­ter­view with the Chi­nese-lan­guage daily Lianhe Zaobao.</p>
    <p>“There is then a risk that only well-off Sin­ga­pore­ans can buy in those es­tates. And then, of course, the char­ac­ter of the es­tates will change and they may be priced be­yond the reach of or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he added.</p>
    <p>He said that mit­i­gat­ing mea­sures can be taken in two ways:</p>
    <p>First, by “de­lib­er­ately in­ject­ing” smaller units such as ren­tal and two-room flats for the low-in­come into these dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, by keep­ing the price of flats in these ar­eas “af­ford­able”, at both the point of sale by HDB and also when trans­acted in the re­sale mar­ket.</p>
    <p>He did not spec­ify what these mea­sures could be or which es­tates he had in mind, but in 2016, then Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said the Gov­ern­ment may con­sider curbs such as a longer MOP, a shorter lease or higher re­sale levy, when fu­ture own­ers sell their</p>
    <p>HDB flats within the city.</p>
    <p>There will be a pe­riod of pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>In that spirit, my hope is that such ef­forts will go be­yond HDB projects in the city such as the up­com­ing Greater South­ern Wa­ter­front. They could in­clude new Build-to-Or­der (BTO) projects in pop­u­lar es­tates both on the city fringe such as Tiong Bahru and Queen­stown, as well as those fur­ther afield like Toa Payoh, Bis­han and Ma­rine Pa­rade. Any new HDB devel­op­ments in Bayshore along Up­per East Coast Road, for in­stance, would be a prime can­di­date.</p>
    <p>In fact, ideas such as for­mer MP Hri Kumar Nair’s back in 2013 could be con­sid­ered. He said then: “We need to go back to the ba­sics of pub­lic hous­ing. I would there­fore in­crease the min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod and bar such HDB own­ers from own­ing pri­vate prop­erty. Those who own or want to own pri­vate prop­erty do not need pub­lic hous­ing.”</p>
    <p>Right now, the low-in­come group is dis­ad­van­taged when it comes to get­ting a flat in a pop­u­lar es­tate.</p>
    <p>First, they may not to able to af­ford the BTO price of units in choice es­tates. At HDB’s sales launch last month, for ex­am­ple, the price of three-room flats in</p>
    <p>Toa Payoh was three times higher than those in Sem­bawang.</p>
    <p>They miss out again – this time at the chance to make money by sell­ing a sought-af­ter flat at a high price af­ter the MOP.</p>
    <p>They are also un­likely to be able to af­ford these pop­u­lar flats on the re­sale mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Nair’s sug­ges­tion of bar­ring HDB flat own­ers from buy­ing pri­vate prop­erty can mit­i­gate this.</p>
    <p>When HDB flat own­ers are not al­lowed to own pri­vate prop­erty con­cur­rently, they will treat their flats as es­sen­tially homes, since the profit mo­tive is ef­fec­tively re­moved. The in­cen­tive to pay high prices for flats – whether in ma­ture or non-ma­ture es­tates – will be damp­ened, and the mar­ket be­comes less skewed.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic hous­ing – like pub­lic health and ed­u­ca­tion – is rightly seen as an en­ti­tle­ment by ci­ti­zens and a ben­e­fit of call­ing Sin­ga­pore home. But this en­ti­tle­ment fails to serve its orig­i­nal pur­pose when it can be used by some own­ers of sub­sidised pub­lic hous­ing to get so far ahead that they shut oth­ers out from the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic hous­ing is a col­lec­tive good and not just an in­di­vid­ual good. It is a fun­da­men­tal prong in Sin­ga­pore’s so­cial safety net. It is crit­i­cal that it does not be­come an­other man­i­fes­ta­tion of in­equity.</p>
    <p>When HDB flat own­ers are not al­lowed to own pri­vate prop­erty con­cur­rently, they will treat their flats as es­sen­tially homes, since the profit mo­tive is ef­fec­tively re­moved. The in­cen­tive to pay high prices for flats – whether in ma­ture or non-ma­ture es­tates – will be damp­ened, and the mar­ket be­comes less skewed.</p>
