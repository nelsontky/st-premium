    <p>DUBAI • Saudi Aramco said it is still work­ing on a deal to buy a US$15 bil­lion (S$20.6 bil­lion) stake in Re­liance In­dus­tries’ re­fin­ing and chem­i­cals busi­ness, even as lower oil prices force it to slash in­vest­ment spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Mum­bai-based Re­liance’s shares fell in the mid­dle of last month af­ter chair­man Mukesh Am­bani said a trans­ac­tion had been de­layed “due to un­fore­seen cir­cum­stances in the en­ergy mar­ket and the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>A deal with Re­liance would help the world’s big­gest crude ex­porter join the ranks of the top oil re­fin­ers and chem­i­cal mak­ers.</p>
    <p>State-owned Aramco, which bought chem­i­cal firm Saudi Ba­sic In­dus­tries Corp for US$70 bil­lion this year, is al­ready a ma­jor sup­plier of crude to In­dia, while Re­liance sells petroleum prod­ucts to the king­dom.</p>
    <p>“We are still in dis­cus­sion with Re­liance,” Aramco chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Amin Nasser said on a call with re­porters on Sun­day. “The work is still on. We will up­date our share­hold­ers in due course.”</p>
    <p>Aramco re­ported on Sun­day that sec­ond-quar­ter net in­come was down al­most 75 per cent from a year ear­lier. The coro­n­avirus pan­demic halted travel and busi­ness, slash­ing de­mand for crude and fuel.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Petroleum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries cut pro­duc­tion, Brent prices re­bounded from a low of about US$16 a bar­rel in April to nearly US$45, though they are still down 32 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Aramco’s down­stream unit nar­rowed its loss in the sec­ond quar­ter. The loss be­fore in­ter­est and taxes for the busi­ness was US$344 mil­lion, com­pared with US$866 mil­lion a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Mr Am­bani, the world’s fourthrich­est per­son, said last year that Aramco was set to buy a 20 per cent stake in his com­pany’s re­fin­ing and petro­chem­i­cals busi­ness, valu­ing it at US$75 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Re­liance trans­ac­tion would help Aramco reach its goal of more than dou­bling re­fin­ing ca­pac­ity to be­tween eight mil­lion and 10 mil­lion bar­rels a day.</p>
    <p>The Saudi firm had a re­fin­ing ca­pac­ity of 3.6 mil­lion bar­rels a day at the end of last year, in­clud­ing wholly owned plants and stakes in joint ven­tures. The gross ca­pac­ity of fa­cil­i­ties in which Aramco has stakes was 6.4 mil­lion bar­rels daily.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is work­ing to start the 400,000 bar­rel-a-day Jazan re­fin­ery on Saudi Arabia’s south­ern Red Sea coast this year. It also owns the big­gest re­fin­ery in the United States as well as plants in coun­tries such as South Korea and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>It is plan­ning sev­eral Chi­nese ven­tures. Re­liance’s need for a cash in­fu­sion has eased in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>The con­glom­er­ate raised some US$30 bil­lion by at­tract­ing in­vest­ments from the likes of Google and Face­book into its digital unit, Jio Plat­forms, and by sell­ing shares to ex­ist­ing stake­hold­ers.</p>
