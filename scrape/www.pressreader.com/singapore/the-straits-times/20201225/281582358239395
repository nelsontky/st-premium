    <p>Dif­fi­cult is­sues will emerge that trig­ger re­ac­tions as Sin­ga­pore con­fronts ques­tions about racism in so­ci­ety. As­so­ciate edi­tor Chua Mui Hoong says all that is re­quired of Sin­ga­pore as a na­tion and as in­di­vid­u­als, in­clud­ing those from ma­jor­ity com­mu­ni­ties, is to sus­pend judg­ment and lis­ten.</p>
    <p>What would you do if some­one posted a com­ment on your Face­book page that iden­ti­fied you by your skin colour and de­scribed you as a “black man wear­ing white”?</p>
    <p>The con­text was a dis­cus­sion on cannabis and the dan­gers as­so­ci­ated with le­gal­is­ing it. The com­menter had urged some of those par­tic­i­pat­ing in the dis­cus­sion not to be gaslighted by “a black man wear­ing white”.</p>
    <p>The man in white re­posted the com­ment on his Face­book page and asked: “Won­der what Sin­ga­pore­ans will think of the ref­er­ence to ‘gaslight­ing’ by a ‘black man wear­ing white’ – which ap­pears to be in­tended to be deroga­tory.</p>
    <p>“Would peo­ple think this is racist? Or not?”</p>
    <p>He quickly got his an­swer.</p>
    <p>His post of Dec 11 at 4.04pm was widely shared and went vi­ral. Hours later, the man post­ing the com­ment said there was “zero in­tent” to be racist on his part and apol­o­gised “if you or any other peo­ple are slighted by that state­ment”. The apol­ogy was shared by the man in white at 10.10pm that night.</p>
    <p>Just another mi­nor spat on­line? There would be noth­ing very note­wor­thy about the in­ci­dent – ex­cept that the man in white is Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing why he de­cided to highlight the com­ment, he told</p>
    <p>The Straits Times via e-mail: “On­line, peo­ple are less in­hib­ited, par­tic­u­larly when it is po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated. You see abuse, stereo­typed name-call­ing, deroga­tory re­marks based on skin colour, other such be­hav­iour. I hope this will change.</p>
    <p>“I pointed out this racially tinged re­mark, and asked if others thought it was racist. It was heart­en­ing that per­sons from all races called out the con­duct as un­ac­cept­able. When we see peo­ple ex­hibit­ing such be­hav­iour, we should say it is un­ac­cept­able. Such words or ac­tions should be called out.”</p>
    <p>He had also re­sponded to a let­ter in Chi­nese-lan­guage daily Lianhe Zaobao that made some sweep­ing re­marks in April about mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>To those at the re­ceiv­ing end of racist com­ments, his ad­vice is this: “Call out the be­hav­iour if you can. Oth­er­wise, seek help. There’s no rea­son to ac­cept racism in any con­text. If it is due to lack of sen­si­tiv­ity on the part of the other per­son – then point it out, and let it pass, and be mind­ful not to use hurt­ful lan­guage to call out racism. We should also see things in con­text. Most peo­ple are well mean­ing, and not racist.”</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up in 1960s Sin­ga­pore, Mr Shan­mugam went to New­ton Boys’ School with chil­dren from dif­fer­ent races and so­cio-eco­nomic back­grounds. They mixed and played across race and class di­vides. In se­condary school at the all-boys’ top school Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion, the en­vi­ron­ment was also racially mixed.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, Mr Shan­mugam says that he per­son­ally en­coun­tered more racism as an adult, af­ter he be­came an MP, than he did as a child.</p>
    <p>“I per­son­ally en­coun­tered some racism af­ter I be­came an MP. In the first few years – deroga­tory re­marks about be­ing In­dian, skin colour. That stopped af­ter a while. I put it down to pol­i­tics. And on­line, again be­cause of pol­i­tics, you get some racism.”</p>
    <p>And he hears of racist en­coun­ters from friends and col­leagues of all races, not just In­di­ans: “Chi­nese, Malays, others, also get racist re­marks made against them. We all know this hap­pens.”</p>
    <p>While racism ex­ists, he added: “We are for­tu­nate, how­ever, that racism is not in­sti­tu­tion­alised, and it is much less preva­lent here, com­pared with many other places. And per­sons from mi­nor­ity races have good op­por­tu­ni­ties to do well, get jobs. And so, as we call out racism – we must also recog­nise and ac­knowl­edge that racism is not wide­spread in Sin­ga­pore, and that Sin­ga­pore has been an ex­cep­tion­ally good place for mi­nori­ties. That has been so be­cause of de­lib­er­ate gov­ern­ment poli­cies.”</p>
    <p>Racism should be frowned on be­cause it is plain wrong and it also un­der­cuts the prin­ci­ple of mer­i­toc­racy: “We were told: Work hard to achieve your goals, sys­tem works on merit. As we grew up, there was a real be­lief that it didn’t mat­ter what race you were, what your sta­tus was; in this coun­try, you can as­pire, it was a mer­i­toc­racy. I be­lieved it strongly.</p>
    <p>“I per­son­ally never felt or was made to feel, at any stage, that race was a sig­nif­i­cant fac­tor to pre­vent me from go­ing to a top se­condary school, or univer­sity, or get­ting a job. Or hav­ing a suc­cess­ful ca­reer as a lawyer. Most of my clients were Chi­nese. I don’t re­call the ques­tion of race ever came up.”</p>
    <p>PUSH­BACK WHEN RACISM IS RAISED</p>
    <p>Two re­cent events prompted me to write this col­umn on racism.</p>
    <p>One was the Face­book spat un­fold­ing across Mr Shan­mugam’s page. The fact that a se­nior Cab­i­net min­is­ter with a rather fear­some rep­u­ta­tion can get such com­ments on his own Face­book page speaks vol­umes of how freely some Sin­ga­pore­ans bandy racist com­ments. The in­ci­dent also made me won­der what other ver­bal in­dig­ni­ties many of our fel­low cit­i­zens are be­ing sub­jected to, daily, in pri­vate or pub­lic set­tings.</p>
    <p>The other was a se­ries of dis­cus­sions that erupted in re­sponse to an ar­ti­cle by a young col­league, Ng Wei Kai, 24, who had ar­gued that racial stereo­typ­ing is a form of vi­o­lence: “Stereo­types dam­age and de­stroy what is in­te­gral yet in­vis­i­ble to the per­son – the sense of per­son­al­ity and self, of com­plex­ity and individual­ity” (Dec 5, “Racial stereo­typ­ing may seem harm­less, but it is a form of vi­o­lence”).</p>
    <p>The no­tion that words can cause harm and even vi­o­lence to a per­son’s sense of self is so patently ob­vi­ous to me, I con­sid­ered it an un­con­tro­ver­sial state­ment to make.</p>
    <p>But quite a few com­menters on­line ob­jected strongly to the use of the word “vi­o­lence” in such a con­text, as vi­o­lence is phys­i­cal whereas the harm done by words is psy­cho­log­i­cal but not “ac­tual” vi­o­lence. Some worry that such lan­guage opens the door for others to jus­tify the use of phys­i­cal vi­o­lence to protest against or re­sist racism.</p>
    <p>The writer, and The Straits Times, were also ac­cused of fall­ing prey to “wokeism” and of be­ing in­flu­enced, or duped, by a Western lib­eral rad­i­cal agenda and im­port­ing for­eign cul­tural con­cepts with their own loaded emo­tional his­tory onto</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s shores, caus­ing un­nec­es­sary di­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>Read­ing those views, I won­dered if I was be­ing overly sen­si­tive on be­half of mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties, in think­ing that con­stant ex­po­sure to a set of stereo­types that den­i­grates one’s com­mu­nity is akin to hav­ing vi­o­lence done to your sense of self. (This in no way jus­ti­fies the use of phys­i­cal vi­o­lence to protest against racism. As for the fear of im­port­ing toxic Western ideas, it is just as wrong-headed to crowd out le­git­i­mate dis­cus­sion of racism here by ref­er­ence to ide­o­log­i­cal bat­tles over­seas that have lit­tle res­o­nance here. Ev­ery so­ci­ety deals with its is­sues dif­fer­ently.)</p>
    <p>On race is­sues, many older Sin­ga­pore­ans are prone to re­peat­ing racial stereo­types and ex­hibit­ing prej­u­diced be­hav­iour. We may even think that laugh­ing to­gether at racially tinged jokes is a mark of so­cial har­mony and friend­ship.</p>
    <p>Un­til we hear from those who are the tar­gets of such jokes.</p>
    <p>Law lec­turer T. Subra­ma­niam, 52, said: “Grow­ing up as a mi­nor­ity, I have felt in­tim­i­dated and made to feel small by stereo­types and ca­sual racism. That usu­ally meant put­ting up with it and put­ting on fake smiles.</p>
    <p>“Some of us grow a tough skin. Some of us learn to gen­uinely laugh it away. Some of us grow to take a po­si­tion that the stereo­type does not re­ally re­flect us and be­come un­af­fected.”</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that such re­peated com­ments can cause psy­cho­log­i­cal harm to in­di­vid­u­als, he said his main con­cern is “whether stereo­types may lead to dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices by per­sons who are con­vinced by such stereo­types. The lat­ter is dan­ger­ous”.</p>
    <p>On whether racial stereo­typ­ing con­sti­tutes a kind of “vi­o­lence”, one com­menter re­sponded to an In­sta­gram post on the is­sue. Ed­u­ca­tor Aaron Ra­joo, 38, who is of mixed In­dian and Chi­nese de­scent, wrote: “There are times when any num­ber of seem­ingly harm­less ac­tions can be ‘vi­o­lent’.”</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple he cited: When a per­son is be­ing called some­thing deroga­tory, he turns to his friends and is met with a wall of si­lence. “This si­lence can be ‘felt’ as an in­cred­i­bly vi­o­lent ex­pe­ri­ence,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>He also re­called an in­ci­dent when Chi­nese ac­quain­tances told him he should date his own kind be­cause he was a “smelly In­dian”: “I re­mem­ber feel­ing the force of that state­ment like a punch in the gut.”</p>
    <p>On­line, there is no short­age of anec­dotes like th­ese – ex­cept that of­ten, com­ments al­lud­ing to racism in Sin­ga­pore at­tract strong push­back from the ma­jor­ity com­mu­nity. This has led to some groups like the In­sta­gram group Mi­nor­ity Voices to of­fer a safe space for such sto­ries to be shared.</p>
    <p>For a crash course on race is­sues, I con­tacted Mr Mo­hamed Im­ran Mo­hamed Taib, 43, a well-known ad­vo­cate of in­ter­faith and in­ter-cul­tural di­a­logue. We meet at 10am one week­day morn­ing. By the time we fin­ish, it is nearly 1pm, and I feel I have barely skimmed the sur­face on this is­sue.</p>
    <p>He shares sto­ries of grow­ing up Malay in mul­tira­cial Sin­ga­pore, sit­ting on a bus, watch­ing yet another show aired in Man­darin with­out subti­tles. He re­calls teacher col­leagues who make re­marks about a stu­dent in their class – “for a Malay boy, he’s quite smart” – and how he gen­tly points out the in­her­ent racism in such a state­ment.</p>
    <p>He ex­plains why he con­sid­ers racism sys­temic in Sin­ga­pore: When in­di­vid­ual in­stances of bias are repli­cated across so­ci­ety, and stereo­types that lead to prej­u­dices and dis­crim­i­na­tory prac­tices are preva­lent, that is sys­temic racism. So when an em­ployer won’t in­ter­view some­one from a cer­tain race be­cause of pre­con­ceived no­tions about their suit­abil­ity, that is sys­temic racism. The em­ployer’s bias is not in­di­vid­ual; it is de­rived from a whole set of ex­pec­ta­tions and as­sump­tions about an en­tire racial com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>In the end, I ask what he wants from the ma­jor­ity com­mu­nity when it comes to race is­sues. I ex­pect some com­ment on race-based poli­cies or per­haps a call for anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he says: “Not much – ex­cept walk with us on this jour­ney. When mi­nori­ties speak of their lived ex­pe­ri­ences and en­coun­ters with racism – please lis­ten and un­der­stand where they are com­ing from. There is a ten­dency to dis­miss, deny or ex­plain away things. I hope for deep lis­ten­ing.</p>
    <p>“Some­times the way it is ex­pressed may not be to­tally ac­cu­rate, or it may be very emo­tional and not ra­tio­nal – but please un­der­stand that th­ese are peo­ple speak­ing from years of ac­cu­mu­lated feel­ings of be­ing sub­jected to var­i­ous kinds of com­ments and bias in daily life, which are real. You may dis­agree it is fac­tual, but you can at least em­pathise with the emo­tions. Lis­ten­ing and em­pathis­ing does not mean you agree.”</p>
    <p>When it comes to race is­sues, Sin­ga­pore is only just be­gin­ning the jour­ney to be more open about racial dif­fer­ences. Af­ter decades when racial har­mony has been prized – and con­flicts nipped de­ci­sively in the bud – a younger gen­er­a­tion is com­ing of age who wants to speak the hard truths of what grow­ing up as a mi­nor­ity is re­ally like in Sin­ga­pore. What it is like to live in a multi-racial so­ci­ety where your sta­tus is pro­tected and re­spected by law; but whose poli­cies some­times seem to re­in­force racial dif­fer­ences; and where so­cial in­ter­ac­tions may be coloured by bi­ased com­ments and view­points.</p>
    <p>Look­ing at the range and in­ten­sity of re­sponses to just the sim­plest ex­pres­sions of hurt by the mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties, I think it is go­ing to be a chal­leng­ing jour­ney.</p>
    <p>And yet we must em­bark on it, or risk keep­ing those hurt feel­ings un­der­ground, hard­en­ing into re­sent­ment and anger.</p>
    <p>All it re­quires of us as a na­tion and as in­di­vid­u­als, es­pe­cially those in priv­i­leged po­si­tions, and those of us from ma­jor­ity com­mu­ni­ties – all it re­quires is to do one thing. Lis­ten. Sus­pend judg­ment and com­ment. Just lis­ten and hear one another out.</p>
    <p>When it comes to race is­sues, Sin­ga­pore is only just be­gin­ning the jour­ney to be more open about racial dif­fer­ences. Af­ter decades when racial har­mony has been prized – and con­flicts nipped de­ci­sively in the bud – a younger gen­er­a­tion is com­ing of age who wants to speak the hard truths of what grow­ing up as a mi­nor­ity is re­ally like in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
