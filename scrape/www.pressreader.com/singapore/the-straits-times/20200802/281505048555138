    <p>Sin­ga­pore has a new gov­ern­ment, with most of the key jobs in fa­mil­iar hands, some fresh faces and a few job ro­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter said it was a Cab­i­net of con­ti­nu­ity and change, but going by the min­is­te­rial ap­point­ments, the em­pha­sis was clearly on the first C.</p>
    <p>You can’t ar­gue with keep­ing to the old team in the on­go­ing bat­tle to con­tain the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>All the ear­lier fears that it would not go away any time soon and that a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions was in­evitable have been proven right.</p>
    <p>But this next wave will not just be a re­peat of round one. An af­ter­shock sel­dom is.</p>
    <p>If a fur­ther shut­down has to be im­posed, the eco­nomic hard­ship al­ready felt will mul­ti­ply and af­fect many more peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact of another pro­longed pe­riod of so­cial iso­la­tion will wear down the peo­ple’s re­solve and com­pound the mis­ery.</p>
    <p>But this time round, will the Gov­ern­ment be able to re­lieve the suf­fer­ing with another deep dip into the re­serves?</p>
    <p>If not, how will Sin­ga­pore man­age round two?</p>
    <p>Amid this sombre prog­no­sis, it is tempt­ing to hun­ker down, keep to the tried and tested way and not try any­thing new. It might be the right ap­proach if the cri­sis was just a tem­po­rary set­back and things will re­turn to nor­mal, such as when a vac­cine is found.</p>
    <p>But, as many have pointed out, the post-Covid-19 world could turn out to be a very dif­fer­ent place from what we have been used to.</p>
    <p>Air travel may take a long time to re­sume to any­where near where it was, with na­tional bor­ders re­main­ing closed.</p>
    <p>There might be fun­da­men­tal changes in the way global man­u­fac­tur­ing is done, as com­pa­nies move away from hav­ing fac­to­ries lo­cated in dif­fer­ent parts of the world.</p>
    <p>New tech­nol­ogy and new ways of work­ing will dis­rupt many ex­ist­ing busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could be one of the most se­verely af­fected coun­tries in the world, with its open econ­omy highly de­pen­dent on the free flow of peo­ple, goods and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>All this means that a re­turn to the old nor­mal is un­likely and that it won’t do to stay in the trenches, keep our heads down and wait out the storm.</p>
    <p>I hope there­fore that when the Gov­ern­ment speaks of con­ti­nu­ity it does not mean more of the same, but will find new ways to steer Sin­ga­pore suc­cess­fully in the brave new world.</p>
    <p>It may be hard to sound op­ti­mistic and hope­ful about the fu­ture amid death and dis­rup­tion, but I think this is pre­cisely what the Gov­ern­ment should do and what the peo­ple want to hear.</p>
    <p>If this is a cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion which threat­ens Sin­ga­pore’s very ex­is­tence – the Gov­ern­ment’s words, not mine – then it re­quires the forth­right re­sponse of a gen­er­a­tion with a clear vi­sion of what lies ahead.</p>
    <p>It calls for in­spir­ing lead­er­ship of the sort the Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion had in abun­dance when Sin­ga­pore last faced an ex­is­ten­tial threat, sud­denly be­com­ing in­de­pen­dent in 1965.</p>
    <p>The cir­cum­stances looked even more dire at the time, when many ques­tioned whether a small is­land in South-east Asia with­out a hin­ter­land could sur­vive after such a dra­matic break from its north­ern neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>The found­ing lead­ers knew then the im­por­tance of shoring up the peo­ple’s con­fi­dence by pre­sent­ing them with a way for­ward which they could un­der­stand and rally around. If you read the early speeches, they were all about the sim­ple mes­sage that a newly in­de­pen­dent country like Sin­ga­pore, de­void of nat­u­ral re­sources, could only sur­vive if it put in ex­tra­or­di­nary ef­forts, united un­der a strong lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>This ral­ly­ing call was suited to the tem­per of that time, when most of the peo­ple were dirt poor and wanted des­per­ately to im­prove their lives. But it re­quired strong lead­ers with clear ideas of what needed to be done to de­velop the econ­omy and at­tract in­vest­ments, and the know-how to cre­ate the nec­es­sary jobs.</p>
    <p>Ob­vi­ously the same rhetoric will not work for to­day’s gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is no longer a poor Third World country but one of the wealth­i­est, with a highly ed­u­cated work­force in a di­ver­si­fied and so­phis­ti­cated econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Merely telling ev­ery­one to pull up their socks will not have the same effect as it did 55 years ago.</p>
    <p>It may not be pos­si­ble to fore­tell what the new world will be like given so much un­cer­tainty, but the job of lead­er­ship is to give new hope that res­onates with the peo­ple’s as­pi­ra­tions of what they want for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>I hope that when the new Par­lia­ment is con­vened later this month, it will be clearer what this is.</p>
    <p>The most ex­cit­ing pos­si­bil­ity, for me, so far has been the idea of a new so­cial com­pact, which Senior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam spoke about at a panel dis­cus­sion last week.</p>
    <p>This was how he put it: “We’re not going back to large states per se… but we do have to go back to a sense of mo­ral pur­pose in gov­ern­ment, hav­ing the con­fi­dence to con­vince the pop­u­la­tion that these are the right things to do... and go about it with the spirit of an ac­tivist.”</p>
    <p>This was ex­actly how the pi­o­neer­ing gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers suc­ceeded in gain­ing the peo­ple’s trust, be­cause they were seen as hav­ing a sense of mo­ral pur­pose to up­lift the peo­ple out of poverty.</p>
    <p>Their poli­cies fol­lowed, driven by this one over­ar­ch­ing goal, and so jobs were cre­ated, homes built and univer­sal ed­u­ca­tion made avail­able to all. Along the way though, as Sin­ga­pore de­vel­oped, other ideas crept in to cor­rupt the orig­i­nal pur­pose.</p>
    <p>Home own­er­ship be­came not just a roof over your head but how to en­hance your as­sets, and the rich be­came grossly richer from prop­erty spec­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>There were jobs, and there were jobs, and Sin­ga­pore be­came se­duced by the Amer­i­can idea that the top boss should com­mand a glob­ally com­pet­i­tive salary, never mind how much more it was com­pared with that of his lower-paid sub­or­di­nates.</p>
    <p>Univer­sal ed­u­ca­tion was a won­der­ful idea and the best way to try to level the play­ing field, but not when chil­dren from wealthy fam­i­lies en­joyed a huge ad­van­tage over the less well-off be­cause of the re­sources they had.</p>
    <p>It is very hard to get ev­ery­one to pull to­gether in the same di­rec­tion when there are too many ar­eas of un­equal op­por­tu­ni­ties and in­equal­ity. It is why Amer­ica is such a di­vided country.</p>
    <p>I was glad there­fore to read Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong high­light­ing this is­sue at the swear­ing-in of the new Cab­i­net, when he said: “We as­pire to be a fair and just so­ci­ety. With op­por­tu­ni­ties for all. We wish to fash­ion an in­clu­sive com­mu­nity, where we look out for one another. Reach out to those who need help and show ev­ery Sin­ga­porean they have a stake in our fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>A fair and just so­ci­ety is a call per­fectly suited to the tem­per of this time, and it starts with a gov­ern­ment guided by a clear sense of mo­ral pur­pose.</p>
    <p>How can it breathe new life into this old slo­gan?</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has come a long way since those early poverty-rid­den days and there is much to be proud of in what it has achieved.</p>
    <p>But there is still too much in­equal­ity and a gulf be­tween not just those with wealth but also those with op­por­tu­ni­ties and con­nec­tions and those with­out.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has done much in re­cent years to nar­row the gap, but the key is to re­dis­cover a sense of mo­ral pur­pose sim­i­lar to what in­spired an ear­lier gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve it has to come from the guts, an in­stinc­tive grasp of what is right or wrong.</p>
    <p>When you see 70-year-olds hav­ing to clean ta­bles and toi­lets at hawker cen­tres, you do not need a de­gree in eco­nom­ics to know it is not right.</p>
    <p>When a per­son who has worked for 40 years full-time in af­flu­ent Sin­ga­pore can­not afford to re­tire and have a de­cent life there­after, it should be clear to ev­ery­one that his fate has not been fair and just.</p>
    <p>I hope that in the post-Covid-19 world, Sin­ga­pore­ans and their lead­ers will reach a com­mon un­der­stand­ing of what is fair and just.</p>
    <p>When they do, a sense of mo­ral pur­pose will drive them for­ward.</p>
