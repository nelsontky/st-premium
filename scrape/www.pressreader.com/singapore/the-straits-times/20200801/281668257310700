    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s sweep­ing anti-graft cam­paign has claimed a ma­jor scalp, with the for­mer party chief of north-western Shaanxi prov­ince be­ing sen­tenced to death for pock­et­ing more than 717 mil­lion yuan (S$141 mil­lion) in bribes.</p>
    <p>Zhao Zhengy­ong was given a two-year sus­pended death sen­tence yes­ter­day, af­ter which his term could be re­duced to life in prison, ruled a court in Tian­jin.</p>
    <p>He was said to have used his of­fi­cial po­si­tion to ob­tain bribes be­tween 2003 and 2018 from busi­ness­men look­ing for big pro­ject deals such as those in en­ergy and prop­erty de­vel­op­ment, and peo­ple seek­ing job pro­mo­tions.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said he took bribes of more than 717 mil­lion yuan – in­clud­ing 100 mil­lion yuan in prop­erty and stocks – said to be the largest amount in a cor­rup­tion case since Pres­i­dent Xi clamped down on graft af­ter tak­ing power in 2012.</p>
    <p>“Zhao’s be­hav­iour con­sti­tutes a crime of bribery and he should be sen­tenced to death, be­cause the amount of bribes he ac­cepted was ex­tremely large and what he did brought ex­tremely great losses to the coun­try and the peo­ple,” Chi­nese state me­dia re­ported the court as say­ing in its rul­ing.</p>
    <p>“But given that he pleaded guilty and all his il­licit gains were seized or frozen, we gave him a sus­pended death sen­tence as a le­nient pun­ish­ment.”</p>
    <p>Over 630 mil­lion yuan in cash and as­sets were seized by the au­thor­i­ties, as well as 100 mil­lion yuan in prop­erty and stocks.</p>
    <p>Zhao, 69, a na­tive of An­hui, be­came vice-gover­nor of Shaanxi, which has a pop­u­la­tion of 37 mil­lion, in 2005 and gover­nor in 2010.</p>
    <p>In 2012, he was pro­moted to party sec­re­tary of the prov­ince, tak­ing over from Mr Zhao Leji who was later ap­pointed by Mr Xi as head of the Cen­tral Com­mis­sion for Dis­ci­pline In­spec­tion, the top anti-cor­rup­tion body in China.</p>
    <p>Zhao stepped down as Shaanxi party boss in 2016.</p>
    <p>He was ar­rested last year, a week af­ter state broad­caster CCTV aired a pro­gramme show­ing Shaanxi of­fi­cials crit­i­cis­ing an un­named leader for not car­ry­ing out Pres­i­dent Xi’s or­ders to tear down hun­dreds of il­le­gally built vil­las in a na­ture re­serve.</p>
    <p>Zhao, who was ex­pelled from the Com­mu­nist Party in Jan­uary, is not ap­peal­ing his sen­tence.</p>
    <p>For­mer cul­ture and tourism vicem­i­nis­ter Li Jin­zao was also put un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion on Wed­nes­day for “se­ri­ous vi­o­la­tions”, said the Cen­tral Com­mis­sion for Dis­ci­pline In­spec­tion, with­out giv­ing de­tails.</p>
