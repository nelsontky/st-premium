    <p>In­te­grated re­sort op­er­a­tor Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) is lay­ing off a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of em­ploy­ees as it grap­ples with the “dev­as­tat­ing im­pact” the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has had on the tourism in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>RWS said yes­ter­day the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise was a “one-off work­place ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion” and that the com­pany has man­aged to re­tain the vast ma­jor­ity of its lo­cal staff.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that about 2,000 em­ploy­ees were laid off, but when asked, RWS did not want to con­firm any fig­ure.</p>
    <p>The firm has about 7,000 em­ploy­ees as of the end of last year.</p>
    <p>RWS added that all af­fected staff will get fair com­pen­sa­tion. It is work­ing with the Gov­ern­ment and var­i­ous agen­cies to help them find new jobs.</p>
    <p>RWS said the de­ci­sion was made af­ter a thor­ough process of care­ful de­lib­er­a­tion and con­sul­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Tourism world­wide has been hard hit by the pan­demic as coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, im­posed travel re­stric­tions to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the pan­demic’s im­pact on tourism has been dev­as­tat­ing, RWS said: “Its per­va­sive and last­ing ef­fects will ac­cel­er­ate shifts in the tourism in­dus­try that re­quire sig­nif­i­cant ad­just­ments by all travel and tourism play­ers.</p>
    <p>“RWS will be­gin the jour­ney to adapt and trans­form as we stand united with Sin­ga­pore to weather this cri­sis and pre­pare for the re­cov­ery of Sin­ga­pore’s tourism.”</p>
    <p>It added that it has been stream­lin­ing its op­er­a­tional re­sources to stay ag­ile and re­spond quickly to sit­u­a­tions in the cur­rent un­pre­dictable cli­mate.</p>
    <p>“Over the past few months, we have re­viewed all costs, elim­i­nated non-es­sen­tial spend­ing and re­duced the salaries of man­age­ment by up to 30 per cent,” said RWS.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal work­ers who were re­trenched by in­te­grated re­sort op­er­a­tor Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) will each have at least two to three job op­por­tu­ni­ties to con­sider.</p>
    <p>RWS said at the an­nounce­ment of the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise yes­ter­day that it has worked with a mul­ti­a­gency task force, which in­cludes the At­trac­tions, Re­sorts and En­ter­tain­ment Union (AREU) and the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i), to iden­tify and match j ob open­ings to af­fected Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents based on their skills and ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>RWS said: “We fully un­der­stand the dif­fi­culty and anx­i­ety this means to im­pacted team mem­bers and their fam­i­lies. We stand in sol­i­dar­ity with the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment in iden­ti­fy­ing all pos­si­ble op­por­tu­ni­ties to help them tran­si­tion smoothly to new ca­reers.”</p>
    <p>It added that it has worked with the AREU to en­sure the vast ma­jor­ity of its lo­cal staff have been re­tained dur­ing the “work­force ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion” ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Re­tained staff will be trained to drive growth in its RWS2.0 trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>RWS 2.0 was an­nounced in April last year as a $4.5 bil­lion pro­ject to rev­o­lu­tionise vis­i­tor ex­pe­ri­ence at the in­te­grated re­sort. It will add more than 164,000 sq m of gross floor area, with new fa­cil­i­ties in­clud­ing a wa­ter­front com­plex hous­ing two ho­tels, re­tail es­tab­lish­ments and ad­di­tions to Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore (USS).</p>
    <p>RWS said: “We will re­design jobs across the re­sort with tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion en­hanc­ing day-to-day pro­cesses, in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity and cre­ate jobs with bet­ter re­mu­ner­a­tion prospects.</p>
    <p>“RWS will also build up a pas­sion­ate and en­tre­pre­neur­ial tal­ent pool with a stronger Sin­ga­porean core form­ing three-quar­ters of the work­force.”</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of new jobs in­clude roles in pre­dic­tive an­a­lyt­ics, en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices and en­ter­tain­ment sup­port for new zones in USS.</p>
    <p>Train­ing will be sup­ported by the RWS Academy, which will work with Work­force Sin­ga­pore and Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore to up­grade worker skills.</p>
    <p>Last known es­ti­mates of RWS’ work­force in­di­cate that the com­pany had around 7,000 staff mem­bers at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that about 2,000 em­ploy­ees were laid off. RWS de­clined to pro­vide the num­ber of work­ers it had re­trenched and did not want to con­firm any fig­ure.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said the Task­force for</p>
    <p>Re­spon­si­ble Re­trench­ment and Em­ploy­ment Fa­cil­i­ta­tion was aware of RWS’ or­gan­i­sa­tional changes and is work­ing with AREU to help af­fected em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>The task force is made up of rep­re­sen­ta­tives from Work­force Sin­ga­pore, MOM, NTUC and e2i.</p>
    <p>AREU and e2i said i n a joint state­ment that they were given ad­vance no­tice of RWS’ re­trench­ment plans. They said RWS had de­cided on the ex­er­cise as a last re­sort. They also noted that RWS has ful­filled its obli­ga­tions and helped work­ers in the past few months.</p>
    <p>E2i added that it has in­vited em­ploy­ers from var­i­ous in­dus­tries to hold phys­i­cal job fairs at e2i un­der the SGUnited Jobs ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Labour chief Ng Chee Meng, who vis­ited RWS yes­ter­day morn­ing to speak with re­trenched work­ers, said NTUC will con­tinue to en­gage RWS on its re­cov­ery plans and trans­for­ma­tion jour­ney.</p>
    <p>“We urge other em­ploy­ers to also tap NTUC’s Job Se­cu­rity Coun­cil to as­sist work­ers to tran­sit to new em­ploy­ment quickly,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the re­trench­ment was not sur­pris­ing, given that tourism has stopped in Sin­ga­pore due to travel re­stric­tions aimed at curb­ing the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Wal­ter Th­e­seira, an econ­o­mist from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences, said: “The in­te­grated re­sorts are sized for ex­ter­nal de­mand... and were never de­signed solely for do­mes­tic de­mand. Since ex­ter­nal de­mand has been shut off due to Covid-19, their ex­ist­ing lev­els of man­power are just not sus­tain­able.”</p>
    <p>He added that more firms in the tourism in­dus­try are likely to re­trench work­ers in the com­ing months as there is no clear time­line yet for bor­ders to re­open to mass tourism.</p>
    <p>Ngee Ann Polytech­nic’s se­nior lec­turer in tourism Michael Chiam said: “It will take a while for the tourism in­dus­try to re­cover, most prob­a­bly in 2021. Most tourist es­tab­lish­ments will of­fer more cre­ative prod­ucts, such as more cus­tomised prod­ucts for smaller groups of guests, given the new nor­mal and the need for safe man­age­ment.”</p>
