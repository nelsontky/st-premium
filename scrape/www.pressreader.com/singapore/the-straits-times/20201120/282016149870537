    <p>The re­cently re­leased Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Men­tal Well-be­ing at Work­places is en­cour­ag­ing (New tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory sets out steps to tackle men­tal health needs of workers, ST On­line, Nov 17). How­ever, most of the rec­om­men­da­tions are fo­cused on strength­en­ing workers’ re­silience or spot­ting warn­ing signs but do not con­sider the more im­por­tant as­pect of ac­tu­ally fix­ing faulty work­ing cul­tures in or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>As high­lighted in an ar­ti­cle in the Har­vard Busi­ness Re­view last De­cem­ber, em­ployee burnout of­ten has less to do with a per­son’s char­ac­ter­is­tics than the or­gan­i­sa­tion he is work­ing for. A sur­vey of 7,500 full-time em­ploy­ees by Gallup re­vealed the top five rea­sons for burnout to be:</p>
    <p>• Un­fair treat­ment at work • Un­man­age­able work­load • Lack of role clar­ity</p>
    <p>• Lack of com­mu­ni­ca­tion and</p>
    <p>sup­port from their man­ager • Un­rea­son­able time pres­sure</p>
    <p>These fac­tors are in­her­ently re­lated to an or­gan­i­sa­tional cul­ture over which em­ploy­ees have lit­tle con­trol. Hence, the onus is on lead­ers to recog­nise that preven­tive ef­forts can only start with them.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic pro­vides the per­fect op­por­tu­nity for or­gan­i­sa­tions to re­flect on their cur­rent prac­tices and change them as nec­es­sary to sup­port their em­ploy­ees bet­ter.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, im­ple­ment­ing task-based sched­ules in­stead of work­ing hours where pos­si­ble could al­low greater flex­i­bil­ity for em­ploy­ees to ne­go­ti­ate and agree upon a rea­son­able num­ber of as­sign­ments or tasks that need to be com­pleted each week or day.</p>
    <p>This change em­pow­ers em­ploy­ees to de­ter­mine how their time should be spent while en­sur­ing the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s pro­duc­tiv­ity is not hin­dered. For shift workers, per­haps re­duc­ing the du­ra­tion of each shift and al­low­ing em­ploy­ees to spread them out across a week, should they wish, would give them greater au­ton­omy, al­low­ing them bet­ter work-life bal­ance.</p>
    <p>The pos­si­bil­i­ties and fu­ture of work are end­less, lim­ited only by how or­gan­i­sa­tions choose to bal­ance pro­duc­tiv­ity and em­ployee men­tal health – the two not be­ing di­choto­mous choices.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions that do not sup­port the well-be­ing of their em­ploy­ees ex­pe­ri­ence a higher turnover rate, lower pro­duc­tiv­ity, and in­creased health­care spend­ing. Im­ple­ment­ing mea­sures such as more work­shops and well­ness classes is not going to im­prove the men­tal health of em­ploy­ees if the broader or­gan­i­sa­tional and work­ing cul­ture is the prob­lem. This pandemic is our chance to re-en­vi­sion and re­design work­ing life in Sin­ga­pore as we know it. Jonathan Kuek Han Loong</p>
