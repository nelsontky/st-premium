    <p>•</p>
    <p>Afghan gov­ern­ment rep­re­sen­ta­tives and Tale­ban in­sur­gents have gath­ered for his­toric peace talks aimed at end­ing two decades of war that has killed tens of thou­sands of com­bat­ants and civil­ians.</p>
    <p>Ahead of face-to-face ne­go­ti­a­tions in com­ing days, the war­ring sides were urged by var­i­ous coun­tries and groups to reach an im­me­di­ate cease­fire and forge an agree­ment that upholds women’s rights.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who is ea­ger to claim an end to Amer­ica’s long­est con­flict as he seeks re-elec­tion, ex­pressed its in­ten­tion to use aid as lever­age for a deal.</p>
    <p>The open­ing cer­e­mony yes­ter­day came one day af­ter the 19th an­niver­sary of the 9/11 at­tacks on the United States that trig­gered its mil­i­tary in­volve­ment in Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo urged the war­ring sides to seize the op­por­tu­nity to strike a com­pre­hen­sive peace deal, while ac­knowl­edg­ing many chal­lenges lay ahead.</p>
    <p>“The choice of your po­lit­i­cal sys­tem is yours to make,” he told the open­ing cer­e­mony in the Qatari cap­i­tal Doha.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve firmly that pro­tect­ing the rights of all Afghans is the best way for you to break the cy­cle of vi­o­lence.”</p>
    <p>The head of Afghanista­n’s peace coun­cil, Mr Ab­dul­lah Ab­dul­lah, said that even if the two sides could not agree on all points, they should com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>“My del­e­ga­tion (is) in Doha rep­re­sent­ing a po­lit­i­cal sys­tem that is sup­ported by mil­lions of men and women from a di­ver­sity of cul­tural, social and eth­nic back­grounds in our home­land,” he said.</p>
    <p>Tale­ban leader Mul­lah Baradar Akhund said that Afghanista­n should “have an Is­lamic sys­tem in which all tribes and eth­nic­i­ties of the coun­try find them­selves with­out any dis­crim­i­na­tion and live their lives in love and broth­er­hood”.</p>
    <p>US Spe­cial En­voy Zal­may Khalilzad told re­porters that pre­vent­ing ter­ror­ism was the chief con­di­tion but that pro­tect­ing mi­nor­ity and women’s rights would also in</p>
    <p>flu­ence any fu­ture de­ci­sions on Congress-al­lo­cated fund­ing.</p>
    <p>“There is no blank cheque,” said Mr Khalilzad.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials, diplo­mats and an­a­lysts</p>
    <p>say that al­though get­ting both sides to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble was a ma­jor achieve­ment, this does not mean the path to peace will be easy, es­pe­cially with vi­o­lence in­creas­ing around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>How to in­clude the Tale­ban, who have re­jected the le­git­i­macy of the West­ern-backed Afghan gov­ern­ment, in any gov­ern­ing ar­range­ment and how to safe­guard the rights of women and mi­nori­ties who suf­fered un­der Tale­ban rule are also big chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“The Afghan peo­ple must be at the heart of this peace process... that leaves no one be­hind, in­clud­ing women,” said In­done­sian For­eign Min­is­ter Retno Mar­sudi.</p>
    <p>Then-pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush sent US forces into Afghanista­n a month af­ter the 9/11 at­tacks to hunt down their mas­ter­mind, Osama bin Laden, a Saudi given sanc­tu­ary by the coun­try’s Is­lamist Tale­ban rulers.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Tale­ban regime was quickly top­pled, they re­grouped and have since waged an in­sur­gency that has sucked in Afghanista­n’s neigh­bours and troops from dozens of coun­tries, in­clud­ing Nato forces.</p>
