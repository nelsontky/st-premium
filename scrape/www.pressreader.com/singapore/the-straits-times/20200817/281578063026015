    <p>Even as young peo­ple strive to over­come the chal­lenges brought about by the pan­demic, they must not lose sight of the big pic­ture, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said yes­ter­day. She was speak­ing to re­porters on the side­lines of a di­a­logue with young lead­ers from Youth Corps Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Even as young peo­ple strive to over­come the chal­lenges brought about by the Covid-19 out­break, they must not lose sight of the big pic­ture, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes the fact that Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is in the process of re­struc­tur­ing, and that new mar­kets and op­por­tu­ni­ties will open up.</p>
    <p>“Some­times we look at the sub­set of is­sues fac­ing us, but we for­get the big­ger pic­ture: the var­i­ous ini­tia­tives that are be­ing em­barked on to help the econ­omy to grow,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We started re­struc­tur­ing the econ­omy be­fore Covid-19, and that ef­fort is on­go­ing... And that is the pic­ture that we also need to look at.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent was speak­ing to re­porters on the side­lines of a di­a­logue with young lead­ers from Youth Corps Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Al­though many such events have gone on­line since the out­break be­gan, yes­ter­day’s ses­sion was con­ducted in per­son at the Is­tana.</p>
    <p>There were around 20 par­tic­i­pants, who were seated at least 1m apart and wore masks ex­cept when they were speak­ing.</p>
    <p>One par­tic­i­pant was Mr Chin Jun Wuen, 21, who started the on­line com­mu­nity SGEx­ams for stu­dents to share notes and help one an­other with home­work.</p>
    <p>It has since ex­panded its scope, and now also or­gan­ises vol­un­teer projects for young peo­ple to give back to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“When Covid-19 hit, the stu­dents were re­ally quite af­fected be­cause they had to switch to on­line learn­ing, and some didn’t know how to adapt,” said Mr Chin, an un­der­grad­u­ate.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, SGEx­ams or­gan­ised an on­line “mug­gathon” to help stu­dents study to­gether in an on­line space.</p>
    <p>It also worked on vol­un­teer projects, such as dis­tribut­ing care packs to clean­ing staff at MRT sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah also spoke at an event or­gan­ised by in­ter­faith group Hu­man­ity Mat­ters yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Called The Ma­ju­lah As­sem­bly, the event fea­tured an on­line chat be­tween six young peo­ple from dif­fer­ent re­li­gious com­mu­ni­ties about liv­ing with the out­break through a re­li­gious lens.</p>
    <p>It was hosted by MacPher­son MP Tin Pei Ling.</p>
    <p>In a video mes­sage, the Pres­i­dent noted that many are turn­ing to their faiths to find “strength, com­fort and re­silience” in the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Faith vol­un­teers and hu­man­i­tar­ian groups have also ex­tended sup­port to vul­ner­a­ble groups in Sin­ga­pore, as well as coun­tries in the re­gion, she said.</p>
    <p>“I hope our com­mu­nity and faith lead­ers will con­tinue to stay united,” she added.</p>
    <p>“As we face this com­mon chal­lenge of the pan­demic, let us stand in sol­i­dar­ity with one an­other, to build a stronger and more co­he­sive Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
