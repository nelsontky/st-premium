    <p>Al­lies of Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim yes­ter­day called on the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion to stop “wast­ing time” af­ter spend­ing over three months try­ing to en­tice “op­por­tunis­tic” gov­ern­ment MPs to its camp in a bid to wrest power from Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>De­spite Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) pres­i­dent Datuk Seri An­war claim­ing a now widely mocked “strong, for­mi­da­ble and con­vinc­ing” ma­jor­ity of fed­eral law­mak­ers on Sept 23, the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) rul­ing pact has re­mained in­tact and on Tues­day passed Bud­get 2021, en­sur­ing no loss of sup­ply for Tan Sri Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) and Parti Amanah Ne­gara want their PH coali­tion to fo­cus on unit­ing the op­po­si­tion ahead of a gen­eral elec­tion ex­pected next year, hav­ing seen “op­por­tunis­tic gov­ern­ment back­benchers ex­ploit­ing PH for their own pri­vate ben­e­fit to get more and more lu­cra­tive deals” from the PN ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“The bud­get vote on Tues­day has taught us not to lose our en­ergy on seek­ing the mi­rage of more than 111 MPs based only on PH’s core of 92 MPs. Not a sin­gle gov­ern­ment back­bencher voted with PH, in­clud­ing those who al­legedly sup­port Datuk Seri An­war.</p>
    <p>“Clearly these gov­ern­ment back­benchers are adept at play­ing po­lit­i­cal games to gain max­i­mum lever­age from the PN gov­ern­ment,” DAP sec­re­tary gen­eral Lim Guan Eng and Amanah pres­i­dent Mo­hamad Sabu said in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>They added that PH must ac­cept “the need for a po­lit­i­cal re­set to fo­cus on unit­ing our friends among the op­po­si­tion MPs (and) put aside past bag­gage so that PH can ex­pand to PH Plus with a for­mi­da­ble force of 108 MPs... as a solid group­ing, any­thing is still pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The fail­ure to de­feat the bud­get, de­spite PN hav­ing only a nar­row ma­jor­ity in the 220-strong Par­lia­ment, has led to grow­ing calls for new lead­er­ship in the op­po­si­tion, es­pe­cially from Datuk Seri Shafie Ap­dal’s Parti Warisan Sabah.</p>
    <p>This re­calls un­suc­cess­ful ef­forts ear­lier this year by DAP and Amanah to coax Mr An­war to sup­port his neme­sis Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s bid to re­claim the pre­mier­ship af­ter defections top­pled the PH gov­ern­ment in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>A com­pro­mise pro­posal for then Sabah Chief Min­is­ter Shafie to be nom­i­nated was also re­jected by PKR.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Mr An­war courted dis­grun­tled Umno MPs un­happy at hav­ing to play sec­ond fid­dle in the PN coali­tion to lead­ers in Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia.</p>
    <p>But DAP and Amanah have re­peat­edly in­sisted that PH should not form a gov­ern­ment with “klep­to­crat MPs”, par­tic­u­larly Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi and ousted premier Na­jib Razak who face dozens of graft charges.</p>
    <p>PKR vice-pres­i­dent Xavier Jayaku­mar though has called for PH to rally be­hind Mr An­war, say­ing he “was the sole leader who took it upon him­self to fight and bring down the PN gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>But DAP and Amanah’s call won the sup­port of United Pro­gres­sive Kinabalu Or­gan­i­sa­tion pres­i­dent Wil­fred Tan­gau, who said that “PH Plus must boldly ad­mit its core strate­gic mis­take” of “fo­cus­ing on re­cap­tur­ing fed­eral power with defections” when what was needed was “a par­lia­men­tary op­po­si­tion leader who can form and lead a func­tion­ing shadow Cab­i­net” ahead of the next elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Although elec­tions are not due un­til 2023, Umno – the largest party in gov­ern­ment – wants polls held as soon as the on­go­ing wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions is con­tained, as it be­lieves it can re­sume rul­ing af­ter a fresh vote.</p>
