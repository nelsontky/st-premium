    <p>SPOOKED BY STORMY WEATHER</p>
    <p>Why is our pet dog Coco al­ways afraid dur­ing thun­dery and stormy weather?</p>
    <p>She re­acts to bad weather by run­ning up­stairs and in­sist­ing on be­ing close to us. She also uri­nates out of fear.</p>
    <p>How do we calm her and teach her to be in­de­pen­dent down­stairs, es­pe­cially dur­ing stormy nights?</p>
    <p>An­drew Kwok</p>
    <p>A pho­bia of thun­der­storms in dogs hap­pens for many rea­sons and can occur at any age.</p>
    <p>Ge­net­ics, trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ences or poor so­cial­i­sa­tion when young can be con­tribut­ing fac­tors.</p>
    <p>Some stud­ies have shown that dogs with sep­a­ra­tion anx­i­ety have higher chances of de­vel­op­ing a thun­der­storm pho­bia, al­though this does not mean that all thun­der­storm pho­bias are re­lated to an anx­i­ety or be­havioural dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>A vet or an­i­mal be­haviourist can help eval­u­ate if your dog re­quires treat­ment for a more gen­eral con­di­tion or if it is suf­fi­cient to just ad­dress the noise pho­bia.</p>
    <p>Bear in mind that thun­der may not be the only trig­ger that in­vokes fear of storms.</p>
    <p>Changes in light­ing, hu­mid­ity, wind speed and baro­met­ric pres­sures can also lead to fear re­sponses, as these el­e­ments pre­dict the ar­rival of a storm.</p>
    <p>Hence, sim­ply re­mov­ing the sound stim­uli may not al­ways work for ev­ery dog with thun­der­storm pho­bia, and it is nec­es­sary to de­ter­mine the spe­cific trig­gers be­fore for­mu­lat­ing a treat­ment plan.</p>
    <p>The most com­mon treat­ment strat­egy is to limit your dog’s ex­po­sure to the stim­uli by cre­at­ing a safe and se­cure in­door en­vi­ron­ment so it will not be able to hear the rain, wind or thun­der.</p>
    <p>You may also use sooth­ing mu­sic or white noise to mask the out­door noises and to calm your dog.</p>
    <p>I no­ticed Coco (left) has ear cov­ers. Head­phones and ear­muffs for dogs are helpful in block­ing out some of these loud noises.</p>
    <p>There are also body wraps, or thun­der­shirts, that may help a dog feel more se­cure in such sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Rather than leav­ing your dog alone while it is anx­ious, it may be more ef­fec­tive to be with it and com­fort it, us­ing long smooth pats and al­low­ing body con­tact to help it re­lax.</p>
    <p>It is not pos­si­ble to worsen your dog’s fear by help­ing it cope bet­ter. This is ac­tu­ally a form of counter-con­di­tion­ing, where the storm is as­so­ci­ated with at­ten­tion and com­fort.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a more pow­er­ful re­in­force­ment – such as feed­ing your dog its favourite treat just af­ter the trig­ger is pre­sented and dur­ing the course of the storm – is usu­ally re­quired to help it over­come its fear.</p>
    <p>De­sen­si­ti­sa­tion is another com­mon treat­ment strat­egy that is of­ten paired with counter-con­di­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>This is where the dog is ex­posed to a low level of thun­der sound record­ings that will not bring on the pho­bic re­sponse.</p>
    <p>As it learns to cope bet­ter, you may grad­u­ally in­crease the vol­ume of the record­ings. How­ever, this ap­proach works only if sound is the sole trig­ger of the pho­bia.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing dis­trac­tion dur­ing a thun­der­storm may also help. Play­ing with your dog or pro­vid­ing a treat while it is ex­posed to a low level of the neg­a­tive stim­uli may achieve a pos­i­tive as­so­ci­a­tion be­tween the stim­uli and treats.</p>
    <p>You can grad­u­ally in­crease the in­ten­sity of the stim­uli, should you achieve some suc­cess.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to never pun­ish a fright­ened an­i­mal, as that will only add to its dis­tress.</p>
    <p>It takes ex­pe­ri­ence and knowl­edge to im­ple­ment these treat­ment strate­gies, so it may be helpful to con­sult a pro­fes­sional be­haviourist to guide you through the steps.</p>
    <p>There are also med­i­ca­tions that may help you man­age a dog’s anx­i­ety or fear­ful be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>These drugs are of­ten used in com­bi­na­tion with the above tech­niques. A vet will be able to ad­vise whether your dog re­quires such med­i­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, own­ers should un­der­stand that the out­come we are of­ten seek­ing is not a cure, but an im­prove­ment in help­ing our pets cope bet­ter with pho­bia.</p>
    <p>This takes time, pa­tience and re­quires ex­per­i­ment­ing with mul­ti­ple meth­ods.</p>
