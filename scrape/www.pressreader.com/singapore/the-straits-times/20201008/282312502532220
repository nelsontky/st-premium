    <p>LONDON • The English Premier League is su­ing a Chi­nese broad­caster for US$215.3 mil­lion (S$292.2 mil­lion), say­ing its for­mer part­ner failed to make a pay­ment for rights to show live matches.</p>
    <p>The league ac­cuses PPLive Sports In­ter­na­tional, a sub­sidiary of Sun­ing, of skip­ping a US$210.3 mil­lion pay­ment for live matches and an­other US$5 mil­lion for high­light pack­ages and in­ter­est, ac­cord­ing to a fil­ing in the Bri­tish court case.</p>
    <p>Sports around the world have been hurt by can­cel­la­tions and re­stric­tions on matches as gov­ern­ments re­strict pub­lic gath­er­ings to limit the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While the Premier League has some of the rich­est broad­cast deals, its clubs have suf­fered due to empty sta­di­ums and de­mands for re­bates from broad­cast­ers for re­ar­ranged matches and sched­ules.</p>
    <p>PPLive said in an Aug 26 let­ter that it would break the agree­ments, but in its fil­ing, the league said there was no le­gal ba­sis for the broad­caster to do so.</p>
    <p>The league has since signed a less lu­cra­tive deal in China with Ten­cent.</p>
    <p>The Premier League de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>A spokes­woman for PPLive did not re­spond to queries by e-mail and WeChat dur­ing the Golden Week pub­lic hol­i­days in China.</p>
    <p>The Premier League’s rev­enue is the world’s rich­est and far out­strips its ri­vals such as the Bun­desliga or La Liga, but the can­cel­la­tion of the con­tract, its largest, has been a big blow.</p>
    <p>It comes in ad­di­tion to a loss of around £1 bil­lion (S$1.7 bil­lion) in sales last sea­son ow­ing to the pan­demic, Deloitte said.</p>
