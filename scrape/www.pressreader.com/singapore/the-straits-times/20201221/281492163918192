    <p>Three em­ploy­ees of the Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore ho­tel were likely to have been pre­vi­ously in­fected with the coro­n­avirus, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sero­log­i­cal tests con­ducted on them have come back pos­i­tive, in­di­cat­ing prob­a­ble past in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The tests were con­ducted on the ho­tel staff as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure as 13 trav­ellers who stayed at the ho­tel were sus­pected to have been in­fected af­ter ar­riv­ing here. Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions of these cases are in progress.</p>
    <p>An­other three peo­ple serv­ing their stay-home no­tice (SHN) at the Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore have now tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. But it is likely these are im­ported cases and not linked to the 13 cases be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>The probe into the 13 cases was launched as it was found they had been in­fected by coro­n­avirus strains that have “high ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity”, im­ply­ing the in­fec­tions may have come from the same source, MOH said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The 13 had flown in from 10 coun­tries. But they all stayed in the same tower of Man­darin Or­chard be­tween Oct 22 and Nov 11.</p>
    <p>In a press state­ment yes­ter­day, MOH said 394 peo­ple serv­ing SHN at the ho­tel have been swabbed, and 384 test re­sults are ready, while 10 are pend­ing. Of these re­sults, 381 have come back nega</p>
    <p>tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The guests were tested fol­low­ing the news of the pos­si­ble trans­mis­sion chain at the ho­tel. The test is usu­ally done to­wards the end of their SHN.</p>
    <p>So far, poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests for 158 staff of Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore have come back neg­a­tive for Covid-19. As at yes­ter­day, 571 ho­tel staff have been tested for Covid-19. Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore has stopped ac­cept­ing new guests since Satur­day and is check­ing out ex­ist­ing guests pro­gres­sively,</p>
    <p>MOH said.</p>
    <p>While the three new cases an­nounced yes­ter­day are likely to be im­ported, the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory will con­duct whole genome se­quenc­ing and phy­lo­ge­netic anal­y­sis to de­ter­mine if they could be linked to the 13 cases un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion, MOH said. It takes about four weeks to cul­ture the virus and com­plete the genome se­quenc­ing.</p>
    <p>So far, poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests for 158 staff of Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore have come back neg­a­tive for Covid-19. As at yes­ter­day, 571 ho­tel staff have been tested for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore has stopped ac­cept­ing new guests since Satur­day and is check­ing out ex­ist­ing guests pro­gres­sively, MOH said.</p>
    <p>Guests serv­ing SHN at the ho­tel have been taken in ded­i­cated ve­hi­cles to al­ter­na­tive SHN fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times ar­rived at the ho­tel around 11am yes­ter­day, some of these guests were still be­ing moved out. Peo­ple in per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE), be­lieved to be ho­tel staff and gov­ern­ment per­son­nel, were seen ush­er­ing guests into wait­ing ve­hi­cles. Oth­ers were help­ing to load the guests’ luggage, or di­rect­ing in­com­ing ve­hi­cles to wait­ing spots.</p>
    <p>The ve­hi­cles and per­son­nel in PPE were gone by around 2.15pm. ST un­der­stands that some SHN guests were trans­ferred to Swis­so­tel The Stam­ford.</p>
    <p>A 64-year-old Bri­ton and his Sin­ga­porean wife, 59, are among the 13 cases be­ing in­ves­ti­gated. They ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore on Oct 26 to visit his wife’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton, a re­tiree who used to work in bank­ing, said it was frus­trat­ing to think that he could have con­tracted Covid-19 while un­der SHN in Sin­ga­pore, given that he and his wife had taken ex­tra pre­cau­tions be­fore trav­el­ling here, in­clud­ing self­iso­lat­ing at home in Bri­tain for more than two weeks be­fore their flight.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to en­sure that we were clean be­fore we came to Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his wife tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Nov 6, he was trans­ferred to an­other ho­tel, and he too tested pos­i­tive, on Nov 8, af­ter de­vel­op­ing symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were dis­charged from a com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity late last month af­ter re­cov­er­ing from Covid-19, and are still in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It was very scary to learn that I had Covid-19, given my age and my his­tory of asthma. I al­ways be­lieved that if I caught Covid, I prob­a­bly wouldn’t sur­vive it be­cause of (my risk fac­tors). But it was a huge re­lief that I man­aged to come through,” he said. He added that he hoped to have a full dis­cus­sion with the au­thor­i­ties about what hap­pened when in­ves­ti­ga­tions have been com­pleted.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest frus­tra­tion was that I lost the first 34 days of my hol­i­day... We had been look­ing for­ward to get­ting a lit­tle bit of re­lease af­ter what had been a ter­ri­ble year for ev­ery­body.”</p>
