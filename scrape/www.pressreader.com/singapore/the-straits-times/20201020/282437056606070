    <p>YOUNG ADULT FIC­TION SHINE</p>
    <p>By Jes­sica Jung Si­mon/Pa­per­back/344 pages/$16.91 Avail­able at bit.ly/Shine_Jung</p>
    <p>This de­but novel of Jes­sica Jung, for­merly of Girls’ Gen­er­a­tion, may be a work of fic­tion tech­ni­cally but one can­not be faulted for think­ing it is an au­to­bi­og­ra­phy in disguise.</p>
    <p>In Shine, a Korean-Amer­i­can girl named Rachel is plucked from or­di­nary teenage life to move to Seoul, where she strug­gles to de­but as an idol un­der a ma­jor K-pop agency. Rachel, who has a younger sis­ter, is nick­named Princess Rachel, as she is thought to be the agency’s favourite trainee.</p>
    <p>Jung has an al­most iden­ti­cal back­story as her char­ac­ter, from her “Princess” nick­name to her younger sis­ter Krys­tal Jung, who later be­came part of the nowde­funct girl group f(x).</p>
    <p>The book has al­ready drawn the ire of fans of Girls’ Gen­er­a­tion, which Jung left in 2014 af­ter an ugly fall­ing-out. Some have ac­cused Jung of cap­i­tal­is­ing on the group’s fame de­spite hav­ing left six years ago.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old tells Time magazine that the book draws plenty from her own life and en­coun­ters in the K-pop world. She even in­vites fans to look for clues to find out “who’s who, what’s what, what’s true, what’s not”.</p>
    <p>The book cer­tainly pro­vides plenty of gos­sip fod­der about the K-pop in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Jung is al­most bru­tal in de­pict­ing how un­healthy the sys­tem can be – with teenage girls lit­er­ally weighed on a scale and swiftly in­sulted for any gains, and se­vere bul­ly­ing in­ci­dents which in­clude drug­ging some­one’s drink.</p>
    <p>The darker over­tures of the book are bal­anced by Jung’s love for K-pop – her char­ac­ters come alive when per­form­ing and be­lieve that their mu­sic truly has the power to con­nect people.</p>
    <p>The main char­ac­ters and cen­tral re­la­tion­ships in the book are also deftly crafted.</p>
    <p>The an­tag­o­nist of the story – Mina, an heiress and a trainee along­side Rachel – re­mains un­lik­able till the end of the book, but her arc un­folds in away that evokes sym­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>Her re­la­tion­ship with Rachel is also fas­ci­nat­ing.</p>
    <p>They are fierce com­peti­tors who de­test each other, but when they are made to work to­gether, it be­comes clear to both that their neme­sis may also be one of the few people in the world who un­der­stand how much work they have put into be­come K-pop idols.</p>
    <p>Another in­trigu­ing re­la­tion­ship is that be­tween Rachel and her love in­ter­est, a top K-pop star named Ja­son Lee. He seems too good to be true at first, but is later ex­posed for his com­plic­ity in keep­ing up the dou­ble stan­dards for men and women in the K-pop in­dus­try – which tends to judge and pun­ish women more harshly.</p>
    <p>Rachel’s com­pli­cated re­la­tion­ship with her mother, who is re­luc­tant to fully sup­port her K-pop dream, falls flat in com­par­i­son. Rachel’s mother has po­ten­tial to be an in­ter­est­ing char­ac­ter, but her clash with Rachel was re­solved all too con­ve­niently in one un­sat­is­fy­ing chap­ter.</p>
    <p>That said, Shine, which is part of a two-book deal and slated for a screen adap­ta­tion, main­tains a high en­ergy level through­out be­fore end­ing on an en­tic­ing note that would leave readers want­ing more.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: K-pop Con­fi­den­tial by Stephan Lee (Point, 2020, $15.47, avail­able at bit.ly/KPopCon­fi_Lee), a comin­gof-age novel about straight-A Korean-Amer­i­can stu­dent Can­dace Park, who keeps her K-pop ob­ses­sion to her­self. But when she gets through a global au­di­tion to be­come a K-pop trainee, she is con­fronted by the cost of real­is­ing her dream.</p>
