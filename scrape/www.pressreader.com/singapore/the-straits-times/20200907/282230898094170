    <p>Saudi Ara­bia has cut pric­ing for oil sales in Oc­to­ber, a sign that the world’s big­gest ex­porter sees fuel de­mand wa­ver­ing amid more coron­avirus flare-ups around the globe.</p>
    <p>The king­dom’s state pro­ducer, Saudi Aramco, re­duced its key Arab Light grade of crude by a larg­erthan-ex­pected amount for ship­ments to Asia, its main mar­ket. It also low­ered pric­ing for US buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Aramco cut Arab Light to Asia to a dis­count against the bench­mark oil price used by the Saudis for the first time since June. It is the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive month of re­duc­tions for bar­rels to the re­gion and the first month in six that re­fin­ers in the United States will see a cut.</p>
    <p>Aramco will trim pric­ing, too, for lighter bar­rels to north-west Europe and the Mediter­ranean re­gion.</p>
    <p>Oil de­mand has plunged this year af­ter the pan­demic forced gov­ern­ments to lock down economies, air­lines to can­cel fights and work­ers to stay at home.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia, Rus­sia and other Opec+ pro­duc­ers agreed in April to slash out­put by al­most 10 mil­lions bar­rels a day, roughly 10 per cent of global sup­ply, to bol­ster prices.</p>
    <p>Those cuts and a de­mand re­cov­ery in China have since helped oil prices more than dou­ble. But they are still down around 35 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Brent crude fell to US$42.66 last Fri­day, suf­fer­ing its big­gest weekly loss in al­most three months as in­fec­tion rates con­tinue to climb in na­tions such as the US and In­dia.</p>
    <p>“Aramco un­der­stands the importance of China for the global oil mar­ket,” said UBS Group’s com­modi­ties an­a­lyst Giovanni Staunovo. “The cut for Oc­to­ber might help to sup­port stronger im­ports from China over the com­ing months.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany is re­duc­ing pric­ing for Light ex­ports to Asia in Oc­to­ber by US$1.40 a bar­rel to 50 US cents be­low the re­gional bench­mark.</p>
    <p>It was ex­pected to pare pric­ing by US$1 a bar­rel to a 10-cent dis­count, ac­cord­ing to a Bloomberg survey.</p>
    <p>The Saudis raised pric­ing from June to Au­gust for Asia. How­ever, re­fin­ery de­mand has soft­ened due to weak prof­its from turn­ing crude into gaso­line and other fu­els.</p>
    <p>Asian re­fin­ers are also work­ing through large stock­piles built up ear­lier in the year when crude prices troughed.</p>
    <p>Aramco is cut­ting prices for US buy­ers for the first time since April af­ter Saudi oil ex­ports to the coun­try dwin­dled to the low­est in decades in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia usu­ally sets the tone for pric­ing de­ci­sions by other Mid­dle East­ern petro states, in­clud­ing Iraq and the United Arab Emi­rates, the sec­ond and third-largest, re­spec­tively, of the Opec states.</p>
