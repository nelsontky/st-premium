    <p>When ac­tor Robert Pat­tin­son first laid hands on the script of Tenet, he “raced” through it, he says.</p>
    <p>When the 34-year-old star of films such as The Twi­light Saga (2008 to 2013) told writer-di­rec­tor Christo­pher Nolan and Nolan’s wife and pro­ducer Emma Thomas how he zipped through the text, they were some­what con­cerned.</p>
    <p>“They asked, ‘Did you read it prop­erly? Ev­ery­one else took an­other two hours to re­ally get it.’ And I went, ‘ Oh, s***, they did?’” he re­counts at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence held in April. It was held then be­cause at the time, it was hoped the film would get an ear­lier re­lease date.</p>
    <p>It is hard to blame Pat­tin­son for feel­ing like the kid in the class who does not “get it”. In Nolan’s sci­ence-fic­tion films, deep ideas are hidden be­neath big ac­tion scenes.</p>
    <p>In the space ad­ven­ture In­ter­stel­lar (2014), the weird prop­er­ties of black holes are used to tell the story of the bond be­tween fa­ther and daugh­ter. In the dream-heist thriller In­cep­tion (2010), dreams can be in­fil­trated and shaped by c r i mi n a l s , caus­ing re­al­ity to be­come slip­pery.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor speaks of his hor­ror at los­ing the plot half in jest, but turns se­ri­ous when talk­ing about the den­sity of the story in Tenet.</p>
    <p>When work on set was close to wrap­ping up, he still had ques­tions about loops and threads spun by the story’s time-ma­nip­u­la­tion premise.</p>
    <p>“You can go down one av­enue, then re­alise that the sys­tem you thought the story hinged on has dis­in­te­grated. You are try­ing to grasp the same things as the char­ac­ters in the movie,” he says.</p>
    <p>Pat­tin­son is in block­buster mode. He will play the ti­tle role in The Bat­man (2021), com­ing af­ter ac­tors Chris­tian Bale and Ben Af­fleck. The DC Comics su­per­hero owes a lot of its cur­rent brand suc­cess to The Dark Knight Tril­ogy (2005 to 2012) films di­rected by Nolan. Pat­tin­son’s Bat­man movie is di­rected by Matt Reeves.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor men­tions how he tried to fool Nolan by ask­ing for time off for a “fam­ily emer­gency” when ac­tu­ally, he was headed to the Bruce Wayne try­outs. Nolan replied: “You’re do­ing the Bat­man au­di­tion?”</p>
    <p>“I thought it was sup­posed to be se­cret,” says Pat­tin­son.</p>
    <p>De­spite that awk­ward mo­ment, they had a “fas­ci­nat­ing con­ver­sa­tion” about the Bat­man char­ac­ter, he says.</p>
    <p>Pat­tin­son’s co-star, John David Wash­ing­ton, 36, like the Bri­tish ac­tor, felt out of place, but not be­cause he skimmed the script. It was be­cause the Amer­i­can was work­ing with his idols, among them ac­tor and di­rec­tor Ken­neth Branagh.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton, whose last ma­jor ap­pear­ance was i n the Os­car­win­ning crime comedy BlacKkKlan­s­man (2018), car­ried a note­book on set.</p>
    <p>“Branagh is a mas­ter,” he says of the Bri­tish ac­tor known for his Shake­speare adap­ta­tions (Henry V, 1989; Othello, 1995), as well as for other roles.</p>
    <p>“It was sur­real to be in scenes with him, to get the­atre tips from him,” says Wash­ing­ton. His fa­ther, Den­zel Wash­ing­ton, ap­peared with Branagh in Shake­speare comedy Much Ado About Noth­ing (1993), di­rected by Branagh, 59.</p>
    <p>“He was act­ing side by side with my old man in one of my favourite movies, Much Ado. I was a bit starstruck, to say the least, and was writ­ing down ev­ery­thing I could,” he says.</p>
    <p>Un­like Wash­ing­ton, who is work­ing with Nolan for the first time, Branagh is an alum­nus of a Nolan pic­ture, the war epic Dunkirk (2017).</p>
    <p>His Nolan anec­dote in­volves the film-maker’s unique way of es­tab­lish­ing first con­tact. With Tenet, as with Dunkirk, the process starts with a per­sonal visit and a good sup­ply of his favourite bev­er­age.</p>
    <p>“He turns up at my door, with the script un­der his arm. He likes tea very much, and so do I, so we en­joyed two large pots of tea, in my front room in my lit­tle house in Lon­don,” re­calls Branagh.</p>
    <p>He read the script three times be­tween the time Nolan handed it to him and the fol­low­ing day, when the di­rec­tor called to get his re­ac­tion. Three read­ings be­cause it is such a mind-ben­der, he says.</p>
    <p>“It plays out as a great piece of en­ter­tain­ment, but it is so com­plex. If you had ques­tions af­ter In­cep­tion and In­ter­stel­lar, you are go­ing to have ques­tions af­ter watch­ing this,” he says.</p>
    <p>Tea played a part in ac­tress El­iz­a­beth De­bicki’s meet­ing with Nolan as well. The Aus­tralian ac­tress, 30, like Wash­ing­ton, is in awe of Nolan.</p>
    <p>She had a cup of tea with the film­maker, a man she calls “a god in the in­dus­try, fe­ro­ciously in­tel­li­gent, with a veil of mys­tery” about him.</p>
    <p>On the set, the ac­tress, known for her work in the spy thriller The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and crime drama Wi­d­ows (2018), had to make more ad­just­ments. As with his pre­vi­ous films, Nolan opted to shoot with Imax and 70mm large-for­mat film cam­eras, in spite of how the less ex­pen­sive dig­i­tal video is the in­dus­try norm. She now loves work­ing with the old-fash­ioned medium – “it’s more mus­cu­lar and it’s a strange sen­sa­tion know­ing that the im­age is im­printed on film,” she says.</p>
    <p>But she ad­mits that it can be stress­ful – “it adds a lit­tle adren­a­line” – know­ing that reels of ex­pen­sive film are whirring away while one is act­ing.</p>
    <p>She also learnt the mean­ing of a phrase not used much these days, “to check for hair in the gate”, which means to see if dirt has fallen into the film cam­era, wreck­ing the im­age. Check­ing for “hair in the gate” is done af­ter ev­ery shot and can mean a reshoot if dirt is found.</p>
    <p>“When you know you have done a re­ally good take and you wait for them to check – the stress! – and if there re­ally is a hair in the gate, it’s tragic,” she says.</p>
    <p>Tenet, open­ing to­day, was sup­posed to be re­leased in mid-July. Then Covid-19 hap­pened, so it was moved to later the same month. Then it was moved again.</p>
    <p>Ap­pro­pri­ately for a movie that has char­ac­ters buf­feted by cross­ing time-streams, the film’s re­lease date, as were so many oth­ers’, was un­moored.</p>
    <p>It fi­nally opens this week in Sin­ga­pore and in more than 60 ter­ri­to­ries, with the United States re­lease de­layed till Sept 3.</p>
    <p>The sci­ence-fic­tion thriller is the first of the big Hol­ly­wood sum­mer films, the mega-bud­get, big ac­tion works that tra­di­tion­ally ap­pear from March to Sep­tem­ber, to land on the big screens since the coro­n­avirus shut down cine­mas in Sin­ga­pore from March 27 to July 12.</p>
    <p>What is to be read from its open­ing? For in­stance, does it in­di­cate that things are back to nor­mal, or at least the al­tered re­al­ity that we now take as nor­mal? Is it a sign that the ma­jor stu­dios are con­fi­dent that au­di­ences will get over their fears and re­turn?</p>
    <p>On the first ques­tion – is Tenet the first flower in­di­cat­ing the re­turn of the movie spring? – the an­swer is a qual­i­fied yes.</p>
    <p>Qual­i­fied be­cause it is a spe­cial case. I asked sev­eral Sin­ga­pore film dis­trib­u­tors about what its open­ing means, but none replied, as I ex­pected, be­cause they are usu­ally not privy to the back­ground of de­ci­sions made in Los An­ge­les and Lon­don head of­fices.</p>
    <p>Tenet is a Christo­pher Nolan project. Nolan, the di­rec­tor whose The Dark Knight Tril­ogy (2005 to 2012) made over US$2 bil­lion at the box of­fice glob­ally, has po­lit­i­cal clout.</p>
    <p>The film-maker is fa­mously fussy about his films be­ing shown in cine­mas, es­pe­cially in large-for­mat Imax. As some have spec­u­lated, Warner Bros, his stu­dio, is will­ing to sac­ri­fice box-of­fice tak­ings caused by pan­demic wor­ries and so­cial-dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to meet Nolan’s de­mands for the ear­li­est avail­able slot.</p>
    <p>Other stu­dios have moved films to on­line plat­forms, such as the Dis­ney pe­riod drama Mu­lan, open­ing in cine­mas in Sin­ga­pore on Sept 4 but moved to the Dis­ney+ stream­ing ser­vice in the US.</p>
    <p>Or, as hap­pened with ma­jor projects such as the James Bond movie No Time To Die, and the mon­ster flick A Quiet Place 2, re­lease dates have been moved sev­eral months back, or to next year.</p>
    <p>The next ques­tion is, will the fans show up for Tenet? That ques­tion has al­ready been an­swered. On July 15, the highly an­tic­i­pated zom­bie movie Train To Bu­san: Penin­sula opened here and de­spite so­cial-dis­tanc­ing mea­sures that limit seat­ing to about 20 per cent of to­tal ca­pac­ity, man­aged to break box-of­fice records for an open­ing day by a South Korean film.</p>
    <p>The se­quel to the 2016 hit, Train To Bu­san, is still draw­ing au­di­ences, prov­ing that pan­demic wor­ries are not keep­ing fans away in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Co­in­ci­den­tally, South Korea was the first mar­ket to screen Tenet. As trade mag­a­zine Va­ri­ety re­ports, when it opened across 590 screens last week­end, from Aug 23, it made strong num­bers, earn­ing nearly US$1 mil­lion (S$1.4 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Since then, a resur­gence of coro­n­avirus cases has oc­curred there, spook­ing po­ten­tial movie­go­ers and caus­ing a tight­en­ing of so­cial-dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. Though cine­mas re­main open, clo­sures re­main a pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>In this new land­scape, gov­ern­ment safety mea­sures, whether in Seoul or Sin­ga­pore, care noth­ing for film re­lease sched­ules.</p>
