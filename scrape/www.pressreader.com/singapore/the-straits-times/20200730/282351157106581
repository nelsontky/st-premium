    <p>A hand­ful of com­pa­nies from the tech­nol­ogy and con­sumer durables sec­tors are aim­ing to launch IPOs in South-east Asia later this year, point­ing to an up­turn af­ter Covid-19 pan­demic-hit mar­kets and weak eco­nomic growth slashed fundrais­ing.</p>
    <p>In Malaysia, home im­prove­ment re­tailer Mr DIY has restarted the process for its up-to-US$500 mil­lion (S$688 mil­lion) ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO), boosted by a busi­ness re­cov­ery, sources fa­mil­iar with the deal said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany de­clined com­ment and the sources de­clined to be named, due to con­fi­den­tial­ity.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Philip­pine fibre broad­band ser­vices provider Con­verge ICT So­lu­tions filed for an IPO of up to US$725 mil­lion, cash­ing in on a surge in home-work­ing.</p>
    <p>It held up to 50 meet­ings with in­vestors this month to chart de­mand for the deal, one source said.</p>
    <p>Areit, the Philip­pines’ first real es­tate in­vest­ment trust, is also rais­ing US$275 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv­ity is pick­ing up in the region af­ter grind­ing to a halt in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“IPOs which had been planned be­fore the pan­demic are just wait­ing for the right mo­ment to come back,” said Mr Tham Tuck Seng, cap­i­tal mar­kets part­ner at PwC in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore. “We’ve seen height­ened in­ter­est from health­care is­suers to list as the sec­tor has be­come more im­por­tant,” he said, also high­light­ing in­ter­est from con­sumer-tech firms.</p>
    <p>Total fundrais­ing from IPOs in South-east Asia has fallen to US$1.4 bil­lion so far this year from US$2.9 bil­lion a year ago, Refini­tiv data shows.</p>
    <p>This ex­cludes US$3 bil­lion raised by Thai­land’s Cen­tral Re­tail in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong mar­ket has started to heat up again with US$38 bil­lion (S$52 bil­lion) raised this year in IPOs and sec­ondary list­ings, ac­cord­ing to Dealogic.</p>
    <p>Sources cau­tioned that a pull­back in global mar­kets in re­cent weeks could still de­lay list­ings by</p>
    <p>South-east Asian com­pa­nies, but launches were be­ing read­ied for later this year.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines’ eq­uity in­dex has dropped 25 per cent so far this year, while In­done­sia is down 19 per cent and Thai­land has lost 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, Siam Ce­ment Group’s pack­ag­ing sub­sidiary is test­ing in­vestor ap­petite for its US$1 bil­lion IPO, likely in the fourth quar­ter, which was shelved in March as mar­kets were roiled by the epi­demic, sources said. The firm did not re­spond to a Reuters query.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Mr DIY had put its IPO on hold in March just be­fore the coun­try went into a shut­down.</p>
    <p>“The push to­wards the IPO is be­cause the com­pany’s busi­ness re­cov­ery has been so fast,” said one source.</p>
