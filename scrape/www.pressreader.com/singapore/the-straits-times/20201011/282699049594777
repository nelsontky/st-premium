    <p>Take any of the many high­ways out of the Rus­sian cap­i­tal and you can dis­sect the coun­try’s strata like rings on a tree. Sen­tinel apart­ment tow­ers re­place the bustling il­lu­mi­nated cen­tre, then the belt of car deal­er­ships and box stores drifts by. Grad­u­ally, the land­scape be­comes sparse, with vil­lages and towns spo­rad­i­cally punc­tu­at­ing the stretch of mead­ows and forests for thou­sands of kilo­me­tres in ev­ery di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia is the big­gest coun­try on earth and both the state and the peo­ple take pride in the size of its ter­ri­tory – “from the south­ern seas to the po­lar fringes”, as the cur­rent na­tional an­them goes. That quiet empti­ness, the enor­mity of Rus­sia, has been in­fil­trated in re­cent decades by an alien force: the giant hog­weed.</p>
    <p>This in­vader, an ex­cep­tion­ally tall plant with a toxic sap that can cause third-de­gree burns and blind­ness, has come to sym­bol­ise the fate of ru­ral Rus­sia: ma­lign ne­glect by the govern­ment. While Rus­sia may be vast, most eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity – and much of life in gen­eral – is con­cen­trated in a hand­ful of cities. And af­ter var­i­ous Soviet-era at­tempts to de­velop land through cen­tralised plan­ning, there is ev­i­dence that the cur­rent govern­ment is do­ing the ex­act op­po­site. En­ter the hog­weed.</p>
    <p>In the sum­mer, the giant hog­weed as­sumes the look of dill on steroids; its cof­fee-ta­ble size leaves cre­ate thick­ets im­pos­si­ble to pass with­out a haz­mat suit. In the win­ter, it des­ic­cates into a brown skele­ton.</p>
    <p>Out­side Moscow, the hog­weeds are of­ten the only vis­i­ble land­marks over white fields, omi­nous um­brel­las stand­ing in the snow like War Of The Worlds troops poised to march. Of­fi­cials have be­gun to re­fer to over­grown ar­eas as “con­tam­i­nated”.</p>
    <p>Giant hog­weeds grow nat­u­rally in the Cau­ca­sus Moun­tains. Evolv­ing to thrive on shift­ing soil, they com­pete with other high-al­ti­tude herbage by yielding mas­sive seed counts – up to 100,000 a plant. The plant’s Latin name, Her­a­cleum, hints at its ex­tra­or­di­nary strength. In Cen­tral Rus­sia, where typ­i­cal meadow grasses are much shorter, it quickly over­pow­ers all lo­cal species.</p>
    <p>“Our plants can­not com­pete with it,” Mr Dmitry Gelt­man, di­rec­tor of the Ko­marov Botan­i­cal In­sti­tute of the Rus­sian Academy of Sci­ences, said. “It takes over de­serted fields be­cause it likes un­sta­ble soil. For any alien species, it is eas­ier to in­fil­trate a fluc­tu­at­ing com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Dr Gelt­man speaks in botan­i­cal terms, but he could be talk­ing about life in ru­ral Rus­sia, which has ex­pe­ri­enced a re­lent­less pop­u­la­tion ex­o­dus since the 1990s. Rus­sia has some 222 mil­lion ha of agri­cul­tural land, nearly 100 mil­lion of which are un­used, ac­cord­ing to a 2016 cen­sus.</p>
    <p>Much of this vast ter­ri­tory – 999,735 sq km, about twice the size of Spain – was aban­doned af­ter the break-up of the Soviet Union be­cause it was un­prof­itable to farm. As hu­mans left, the hog­weed ad­vanced.</p>
    <p>It seems the govern­ment does not know what to do with the land, or the peo­ple on it: Ru­ral Rus­sians are twice as poor and job­less as those liv­ing in ur­ban ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Re­search has shown that the num­ber of farms in the coun­try halved be­tween 2006 and 2016. The top 1 per cent of all agri­cul­tural com­pa­nies re­ceive two-thirds of all in­vest­ment – just 61 firms col­lec­tively own over 14 mil­lion ha of farm­land and pre­fer to use sea­sonal mi­grant labour. Ru­ral Rus­sians are shut out of eco­nomic op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Mr Vasily Mel­nichenko, a straight-talk­ing farmer from the Ural Moun­tains who heads a move­ment for ru­ral de­vel­op­ment, says Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin’s govern­ment’s pol­icy towards ru­ral Rus­sia has been aw­ful. Ru­ral peo­ple are seen as a “bur­den”, he said, sap­ping bud­get fund­ing for roads, elec­tric­ity and health­care.</p>
    <p>“It has gone on too long to be a mis­take, but if it’s done on pur­pose, then that would mean we’re gov­erned by en­e­mies,” Mr Mel­nichenko said. “There have been dozens of road maps and na­tional projects, but no­body can carry them out. There is a com­plete in­abil­ity to un­der­stand the ter­ri­tory.”</p>
    <p>Another 20 years of the same, he said, and all the re­main­ing res­i­dents will die out, end­ing the Rus­sian vil­lage as a form of life.</p>
    <p>The giant hog­weed is what hap­pens when a land loses its ste­wards. The weed is ex­pand­ing its cov­er­age by about 10 per cent ev­ery year. It now creeps to the mar­gins of forests</p>
    <p>and rivers, even near ur­ban ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Even the heav­ily built-up Moscow re­gion had al­most 699 sq km con­tam­i­nated with giant hog­weed this sum­mer, ac­cord­ing to the re­gional govern­ment. In the Tver re­gion, which lies be­tween Moscow and St Peters­burg and is the size of Aus­tria, the hog­weed has per­me­ated a third of towns and vil­lages.</p>
    <p>The in­va­sion is one of the many en­vi­ron­men­tal dis­as­ters brought on by Soviet cen­tralised plan­ning. Af­ter World War II, Soviet agron­o­mists, keen to quickly re­build the coun­try’s agri­cul­ture in­dus­try, thought that the plant’s im­pres­sive biomass could make it a good crop to feed live­stock. Seeds were dis­trib­uted through­out the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Hog­weed con­tains a high con­cen­tra­tion of fu­ra­nocoumarin­s, sub­stances that cause se­vere burns and blis­ters when af­fected ar­eas of skin</p>
    <p>are ex­posed to sun­light. Even so, the plant was grown na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>By the 1980s, when the plant be­gan in­fil­trat­ing Cen­tral Rus­sia’s wilder­ness, tests showed that cows fed on hog­weed pro­duced poor­tast­ing milk. Ef­forts to make the plant less toxic failed.</p>
    <p>The plague could not be con­tained. While some re­gional gov­ern­ments now try to spray prob­lem zones with pes­ti­cides, Moscow has not paid the prob­lem any at­ten­tion or sought to un­der­stand its scope.</p>
    <p>Tatarstan, the only re­gion to mon­i­tor its spread, has pleaded for fed­eral help, say­ing that the area over­taken by the hog­weed grew ten­fold in the past eight years, with thou­sands of burn vic­tims and even fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Some ac­tivists and sci­en­tists are ex­per­i­ment­ing with so­lu­tions, rang­ing from hog­weed-eat­ing snails to moon­shine pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>One evening, I j oined ac­tivist Maria Popova on a hog­weed raid out­side the Rus­sian cap­i­tal. We equipped our­selves with gloves, gog­gles and large kitchen knives on the edge of a field that is part of the pop­u­lar Losiny Ostrov Na­tional Park – a large na­ture area close to Moscow.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t in­ter­fere, the hog­weeds mul­ti­ply at a crazy rate and soon there is noth­ing but them,” she said as we hiked through the tall grass.</p>
    <p>Ms Popova started pa­trolling the nearby fields when she came across “plan­ta­tions” of hog­weed on one of her walks. The na­tional park, which is tasked with pro­tect­ing bio­di­ver­sity, has ig­nored the prob­lem, she said. She called hog­weed “a sym­bol of ne­glect”.</p>
    <p>“At the na­tional level, the govern­ment does noth­ing,” she said, ris­ing up on tip­toes and hack­ing off giant um­brella-like flow­er­ing struc­tures on stalks 3m in the air. It is a trust­wor­thy method to pre­vent the weed from seed­ing – one ac­tivist in a hog­weed-fight­ing so­cial net­work­ing group con­fessed to arm­ing her­self with a ma­chete on cy­cling trips.</p>
    <p>But ur­ban ac­tivists are more likely to mo­bilise on­line, while in the prov­inces, there sim­ply are not enough peo­ple who care, said Ms Darya Greben­shchikova, a writer liv­ing in a shrink­ing vil­lage in the Tver re­gion.</p>
    <p>“The hog­weed is not per­ceived as a prob­lem be­cause there is no pop­u­la­tion here to per­ceive it as a prob­lem,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I have lost hope in some kind of re­nais­sance of the vil­lage. The govern­ment has de­cided it’s too much has­sle to keep the ru­ral ar­eas alive, so they are turn­ing it into a desert.”</p>
