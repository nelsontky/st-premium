    <p>To help young Sin­ga­pore­ans make in­formed ca­reer and fu­ture ed­u­ca­tion choices re­gard­less of back­ground, youth-led non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Ad­vi­sory has de­vised ways to pro­vide them with re­sources.</p>
    <p>Ad­vi­sory hopes to create a level play­ing field and sup­port youth in pur­su­ing their pas­sion, said co­founder and pres­i­dent Mock Yi Jun, 23, who is cur­rently serv­ing his na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion has come up with an on­line re­sources repos­i­tory and a men­tor­ship pro­gramme – as well as other events – to help youth, mainly aged be­tween 16 and 28, find out more about the ca­reers and path­ways that are of in­ter­est to them.</p>
    <p>Ad­vi­sory was the win­ner among 12 fi­nal­ists out of 57 teams which took part in the in­au­gu­ral Youth Ac­tion Chal­lenge Sum­mit, held on­line from July 13 to 19 and or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil (NYC), Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth as well as the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion Youth Move­ment.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of each team had three min­utes to pitch their ideas to four judges be­fore be­ing judged on project fea­si­bil­ity, im­pact and val­i­da­tion of prob­lem and idea.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge, launched in Septem­ber last year, en­cour­aged youth to de­velop in­no­va­tive con­cepts to ad­dress so­ci­etal chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>As the top team, Ad­vi­sory will re­ceive $50,000 in fund­ing and $2,000 Cap­i­taLand vouch­ers, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>NYC chief ex­ec­u­tive David Chua said: “The recog­ni­tion goes to not just the win­ners but also to all the other par­tic­i­pat­ing youth teams for tak­ing the ini­tia­tive to meet so­ci­etal needs, and per­sist­ing in turn­ing their ideas into ac­tion de­spite Covid-19 and cir­cuit breaker con­di­tions. That is sheer tenac­ity, and I am proud of our young peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Ad­vi­sory was founded in 2016 and has ben­e­fited more than 87,000 stu­dents through its pro­grammes and events, said co-founder and deputy pres­i­dent (ex­ter­nal) Bren­dan Loon, 23, who will be­gin post-grad­u­ate stud­ies with the Univer­sity of Ox­ford later this year.</p>
    <p>It was formed when a group of 12 then stu­dents met through the Youth Corps Sin­ga­pore Leader Pro­gramme, and de­cided to work to­gether to ad­dress the is­sue of em­pow­er­ing youth in their ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer choices.</p>
    <p>The non-profit now has 51 mem­bers, mostly youth who are still study­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Mock said the team plans to chan­nel the fund­ing to its up­com­ing on­line Guid­ance plat­form, which will be pi­loted next month.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents will be able to go on­line to book one-off in­dus­try con­sul­ta­tion ses­sions with the 150 in-house coaches avail­able.</p>
    <p>It is also work­ing on an Ad­vi­sory Schools Pro­gramme with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion to roll out a suite of pro­grammes – in­clud­ing soft skills work­shops and men­tor­ship sys­tems – at seven post-sec­ondary in­sti­tu­tions next year.</p>
    <p>An­other group, Am­biSense, emerged among the top three teams, with an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence-driven safety alert app to help those in the deaf com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The team, led by Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing stu­dent Woh Jin­gru, built an app pro­to­type that can reg­is­ter par­tic­u­lar sounds in the sur­round­ings and send a vi­bra­tion and vis­ual alert to the deaf user’s mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>The pro­to­type cur­rently picks up three sounds: car horn, fire engine siren and bi­cy­cle bell.</p>
    <p>Ms Woh, 23, said the team part­nered the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion for the Deaf to learn more about the prob­lems the deaf com­mu­nity faces, and de­cided to solve the is­sue of safety when out­doors.</p>
    <p>Am­biSense plans to con­tinue test­ing the app and use the $50,000 grant to ex­pand its cur­rent five-per­son team, so that more sounds and fea­tures can be added to the app.</p>
    <p>It also hopes to reach out to the el­derly, who are prone to hear­ing prob­lems, to see if the app could be use­ful for them.</p>
