    <p>In less than one year, Ms Florence Fong lost five of her loved ones.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the deaths of her grand­mother and boyfriend, the for­mer med­i­cal social worker had to deal with los­ing a friend to cancer as well as added grief when two other friends lost their chil­dren to con­gen­i­tal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Over­whelmed by th­ese deaths be­tween May last year and Fe­bru­ary, Ms Fong sought ther­apy to cope with her deep sor­row.</p>
    <p>“It was hard for me to ver­balise my grief. I did not know how to use my words to ex­press what I was feel­ing. Over time, I was able to heal and I am still in the process of re­cov­er­ing,” said the 35-year-old.</p>
    <p>The spike in Covid-19 cases that led to the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod dis­rupted Ms Fong’s in-per­son ther­apy ses­sions. That dif­fi­cult time spurred her to start A Light in the Night – an ini­tia­tive to pre­pare spe­cial care kits to help oth­ers who are mourn­ing the loss of loved ones.</p>
    <p>Ms Gil­lian Ong, an art ther­a­pist, and Ms Ni­cole Wong, an as­so­ciate lec­turer at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Social Sci­ences, are friends of Ms Fong’s who lent their sup­port to the cause.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Fong: “I imag­ined those griev­ing like me and how they were cop­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. See­ing how Covid-19 has af­fected oth­ers, my ini­tial thought was to reach out to those who had lost a loved one.”</p>
    <p>Ms Fong orig­i­nally set out to make about 100 care pack­ages, putting thought into the items in them that would bring com­fort to the re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>The care packs in­cluded art sup­plies, a jour­nal, scented can­dles, es­sen­tial oils, a soft toy and a spe­cially cre­ated guide­book on how to use the items, along with tes­ti­monies and a re­source guide. Each pack cost about $12 to put to­gether.</p>
    <p>Ms Fong later tapped the os­car@sg fund, which was launched by Te­masek Trust to sup­port ground-up ini­tia­tives re­spond­ing to sig­nif­i­cant and ur­gent lo­cal com­mu­nity needs aris­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic. She se­cured fund­ing for about 800 care packs.</p>
    <p>About 450 packs have so far been dis­trib­uted to re­cip­i­ents through var­i­ous in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Fong, who is cur­rently pur­su­ing a post­grad­u­ate de­gree in coun­selling at the Sin­ga­pore Bi­ble Col­lege, said: “The sub­ject of grief is very stig­ma­tised in the com­mu­nity, and I hope this pro­ject will show that it’s okay to dis­cuss grief and that the topic should not be taboo.”</p>
