    <p>Imag­ine get­ting death threats for mak­ing a video game. Game di­rec­tor Neil Druckmann has had that un­for­tu­nate ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The game is The Last Of Us Part 2 (TLOU2), which might well turn out to be the most di­vi­sive game of the year. It is a story of re­venge between two women, El­lie and Abby, for the deaths of the fa­ther fig­ures in their lives. The back­drop for their vi­o­lent con­fronta­tion is a post-apoc­a­lyp­tic, post-out­break world with in­fected, zom­bie-like hu­mans.</p>
    <p>The back­lash from fans was trig­gered by, among many things, the killing of a main char­ac­ter from the crit­i­cally ac­claimed first game and the in­tro­duc­tion of more LGBTQ char­ac­ters and themes in this sec­ond game.</p>
    <p>“When we made the first game, there were no ex­pec­ta­tions. (With) the sec­ond game, right or wrong, peo­ple ex­pected cer­tain things and we didn’t make a tra­di­tional se­quel. Some peo­ple loved that and some peo­ple had a hard time with it. It was just how in­tense the re­ac­tion was that was sur­pris­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Druckmann, 41, was speak­ing to The Straits Times via we­b­cam from his home i n Los An­ge­les ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing a dark grey T-shirt with his long hair tied back, he had an air of quiet con­fi­dence as he spoke calmly about his lat­est game.</p>
    <p>TLOU2’s launch was orig­i­nally slated for Fe­bru­ary this year. The re­lease date was then pushed back to May and later post­poned in­def­i­nitely due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But, on April 26, footage from the game leaked on­line, re­veal­ing ma­jor plot points. Shortly af­ter that, the re­lease date of June 19 was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>That was when the back­lash be­gan, with Mr Druckmann and stu­dio Naughty Dog get­ting death threats as well as ho­mo­pho­bic and anti-Semitic re­marks, some of which he shared via his Twit­ter ac­count.</p>
    <p>Many gamers who re­acted neg­a­tively to the leaked footage also ap­par­ently showed their frus­tra­tion by “review-bomb­ing” the re­viewag­gre­ga­tion site Me­ta­critic, post­ing low scores out of un­hap­pi­ness even be­fore they had played the game. As a re­sult, user scores were as low as 3.4 out of 10 shortly af­ter the game’s launch.</p>
    <p>The score now sits at 5.5, with 32,000 pos­i­tive user rat­ings to just over 33,000 neg­a­tive ones. The score from crit­ics, though, cur­rently stands at 95 out of 100, with­out a sin­gle neg­a­tive review.</p>
    <p>“Those days are hard be­cause you want to in­spire ev­ery­body, but first you got to take care of your­self. I was beat­ing my­self up, ask­ing what we could have done,” says Mr Druckmann.</p>
    <p>The leaks of the game’s footage were due to the stu­dio be­ing hacked, he says, adding that when it hap­pened, he as­sured his team that it was the fault of no one but the per­son who had stolen the footage.</p>
    <p>“We know this game in­side out and we are still moved by it, and we’ve seen it for years. So those leaks ul­ti­mately aren’t go­ing to mean any­thing.</p>
    <p>“It’s not about any one twist, it’s about this slow ex­plo­ration of th­ese two char­ac­ters. That’s what we all kind of clung to (in or­der) to get us through that pretty tough pe­riod,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing TLOU2 took about six years, an un­der­tak­ing which Mr Druckmann says would have been de­bil­i­tat­ing if not for hav­ing a team of col­lab­o­ra­tors.</p>
    <p>“The vi­sion for us was mak­ing a game about em­pa­thy and do­ing it by show­ing two sides of the story. I don’t know what goes into all of those parts be­cause it’s too big for me to fig­ure it all out.</p>
    <p>“(Game di­rect­ing) is about cre­at­ing a frame­work where we can all get on the same page and ask­ing, ‘now, how do you in­ter­pret it?’” he says.</p>
    <p>The first The Last Of Us game, re­leased in 2013, re­port­edly sold more t han 20 mil­lion copies. TLOU2, de­spite the back­lash, sold four mil­lion copies in­ter­na­tion­ally in its first week­end, mak­ing it the fastest-sell­ing PlayS­ta­tion-ex­clu­sive game.</p>
    <p>Mr Druckmann says the game’s team, which num­bers more than 300, is now re­cu­per­at­ing af­ter the ef­fort of mak­ing TLOU2.</p>
    <p>His fo­cus for the next few months is on fa­cil­i­tat­ing a bet­ter work-life bal­ance for Naughty Dog em­ploy­ees. He wants his team to take a step back to ex­per­i­ment and ex­plore other things even if a third The Last Of Us in­stal­ment were to be con­firmed, so they can avoid burnout and go into their next project with pas­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Druckmann is now co-writ­ing an adap­ta­tion of The Last Of Us for an HBO se­ries. His ap­proach is to fo­cus on what made the game spe­cial and build on it.</p>
    <p>“You have to have the con­fi­dence to say this just doesn’t work in this other medium. We might have to add or re­move char­ac­ters but you’re try­ing to find the emo­tional core,” he says.</p>
    <p>Asked whether he would be ready to leave the game se­ries he helped cre­ate when the time comes, he says: “It’s al­ways hard to leave any cre­ative en­deav­our be­hind and say it’s done.</p>
    <p>“My ap­proach has al­ways been that each game stands on its own and each game might be the last one in the se­ries. Be­cause I don’t know if we’ll ever do it again.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple ex­pected cer­tain things and we didn’t make a tra­di­tional se­quel. Some peo­ple loved that and some peo­ple had a hard time with it. It was just how in­tense the re­ac­tion was that was ’’ sur­pris­ing.</p>
