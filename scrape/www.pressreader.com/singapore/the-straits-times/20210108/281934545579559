    <p>A 1952 short story called Der Tun­nel by Friedrich Dur­ren­matt tells of a stu­dent-filled train ply­ing the moun­tain­ous Swiss coun­try­side only to sud­denly start tum­bling over it­self ever faster into the void of space. The story seems an apt metaphor for the weird ac­cel­er­ated ex­pe­ri­ence of the Repub­li­can Party over the past sev­eral weeks.</p>
    <p>Let’s briefly re­view what has hap­pened since Nov 3, when an al­ready cu­ri­ouser and cu­ri­ouser state of af­fairs in the af­fairs of state re­ally be­gan to ac­cel­er­ate into sur­re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump tried everything he could imag­ine to steal the elec­tion. He lied about the po­ten­tial for fraud be­fore the elec­tion, and spread ev­i­dence-free Big Lie con­spir­acy the­o­ries af­ter it.</p>
    <p>He bul­lied elec­tion of­fi­cials at will and tried to in­tim­i­date the Depart­ment of Jus­tice into fab­ri­cat­ing ev­i­dence that did not ex­ist: At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr jumped ship rather than sail un­der that bridge and maybe go to jail for it.</p>
    <p>Then Mr Trump’s cronies rushed the courts as planned to over­turn the re­sults, and they failed in state courts, fed­eral ap­peals courts and the Supreme Court. Ul­ti­mately even Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell, hav­ing been safely re-elected, peeled off from the Pres­i­dent’s line.</p>
    <p>Next, Mr Trump in­sisted that state leg­is­la­tures nul­lify the pop­u­lar vote and, talk­ing like a mafia boss, asked state of­fi­cials, most re­cently in Ge­or­gia, to “find” him votes that didn’t ex­ist. Mean­while, of course, a cas­cade of “pay-me-later” pres­i­den­tial par­dons spewed forth, which Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Ben Sasse – also safe, thanks to re­cent re-elec­tion – termed “rot­ten to the core”.</p>
    <p>Then Mr Trump in­vited his for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Michael Flynn, who was granted one of those par­dons, to a White House meet­ing where he sug­gested that the Pres­i­dent de­clare par­tial mar­tial law and re­run the elec­tion in sev­eral states he lost un­der mil­i­tary su­per­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was re­port­edly all too open-minded about the idea. This shocked even close aides and re­sulted even­tu­ally, at for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Dick Cheney’s ini­tia­tive, in a pow­er­ful public let­ter signed by all 10 living for­mer de­fence sec­re­taries pro­scrib­ing US mil­i­tary in­ter­fer­ence of any kind in Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal dis­pute.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump then tried to get Repub­li­cans in Congress to refuse cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of the elec­tion on</p>
    <p>Jan 6. Mean­while, he storm-tweeted for his sup­port­ers to come to Wash­ing­ton that day, never men­tion­ing the mes­sag­ing of var­i­ous rad­i­cal right-wing groups that they should ar­rive armed.</p>
    <p>Thir­teen Repub­li­can Se­na­tors, led by Mr Josh Haw­ley of Mis­souri and Mr Ted Cruz of Texas, proved will­ing to pass this lat­est loy­alty test, which amounted to sup­port</p>
    <p>As things stand, de­pend­ing on di­verse lo­cal po­lit­i­cal land­scapes, some Repub­li­cans think the so­lu­tion to their trou­bles is “more Trump”, in other words, more pop­ulist pan­der­ing. Oth­ers, es­pe­cially in blue or bluish states, hope to in­sin­u­ate into be­ing a post-elec­tion GOP iden­tity they can live and get elected with that bears lit­tle re­la­tion to what the Repub­li­can Party ac­tu­ally is right now.</p>
    <p>for a pseudo-le­gal coup. But from this group, dubbed the Sedi­tion Cau­cus in Wash­ing­ton, even Trump loy­al­ist, Sen­a­tor Tom Cot­ton – he who once mooted the idea of in­vok­ing the In­sur­rec­tion Act against anti-Trump pro­test­ers – re­fused to as­so­ciate.</p>
    <p>As a par­al­lel last-ditch ef­fort, Mr Trump sup­ported the imag­i­na­tive but plainly un­con­sti­tu­tional no­tion put forth by Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Louie Gohmert of hav­ing Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, pre­sid­ing by law over the Jan 6 rit­ual, throw out the elec­tion re­sults on his own dime.</p>
    <p>Then on the morn­ing of Congress’ big day came news of the Demo­cratic Se­nate vic­to­ries in Ge­or­gia, in essence flip­ping the Se­nate to the Democrats. That daunted any Repub­li­can sen­a­tor hop­ing to have any in­flu­ence af­ter Jan 20, and so kept the num­ber of coup sup­port­ers from ris­ing.</p>
    <p>At that point, even Mr Trump must have known how it would end, yet he con­tin­ued search­ing for scape­goats, with Mr Pence the fi­nal des­ig­nated chump. Ul­ti­mately, Mr Pence peeled off, too: The Con­sti­tu­tion, mer­ci­fully, gave him no choice.</p>
    <p>So we see the pat­tern: As Mr Trump’s des­per­a­tion led to ever more brazen and man­i­festly un­con­sti­tu­tional tac­tics, Repub­li­cans ei­ther with prin­ci­ples (Mr Mitt Rom­ney and Mr Sasse) or some prac­ti­cal sense of their own in­ter­ests (Mr Barr, Mr McCon­nell and Mr Cot­ton) put dis­tance between them­selves and</p>
    <p>the grow­ing sur­re­al­ity of Mr Trump’s im­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>MO­TIVE AND MONEY</p>
    <p>Why did Mr Trump do this? And how have Repub­li­cans vary­ingly re­acted as the macabre pa­rade of berserk ele­phants left in­creas­ingly mal­odor­ous drop­pings on the na­tion’s con­sti­tu­tional order?</p>
    <p>The first ques­tion is easy to an­swer: for the money. Mr Trump, very deep in debt, raised more than US$200 mil­lion (S$265 mil­lion) in a mere trice af­ter Nov 3 to fund a myth­i­cal le­gal cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one knows where most of the dough will end up; the only ques­tion is whether Mr Trump will ac­tu­ally pay the lawyers who ea­gerly did his bid­ding in court, not car­ing whether they won or lost so long as they could bill the hours.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond, more com­pli­cated ques­tion re­mains a fast-mov­ing tar­get hard to get a bead on.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter Nov 3, we wit­nessed the ex­pected hedg­ing be­hav­iours from within a party that, with few ex­cep­tions, ei­ther aided and abet­ted Mr Trump’s “mid­dle-fin­ger” ap­proach to Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal norms, tra­di­tions and law, or else kept supinely quiet about it.</p>
    <p>Thus Mary­land Gov­er­nor Larry Ho­gan, a vo­cal Trump critic in his own party (but use­fully so in a “blue” state), went out of his way to en­dorse both Repub­li­can can­di­dates in Ge­or­gia Se­nate run-offs. He was hedg­ing to­wards the Trump­ists to stay vi­able in a party in which his views re­main un­pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers like Ari­zona Gov­er­nor Doug Ducey, a more party-line Retrum­pli­can, danced the backpedal for fear that the tide might soon flow Mr Ho­gan’s way af­ter Ari­zona flipped to the Democrats.</p>
    <p>For two months af­ter Nov 3, Repub­li­can politi­cians had only one thing on their minds: Would Mr Trump’s reign over the GOP con­tinue af­ter his loss? Could he still lever­age pop­ulist anger to re­main party king­maker?</p>
    <p>GAME CHANGER IN GE­OR­GIA</p>
    <p>Be­fore the year turned, most</p>
    <p>thought so. Many Repub­li­cans wished Mr Trump’s spell over the party would end, but most in prom­i­nent po­si­tions were afraid to act. Wis­con­sin Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Ron John­son claimed a few weeks ago that pub­licly con­tra­dict­ing the Pres­i­dent’s mad rants would be “po­lit­i­cal sui­cide” for him. Now, a fair num­ber of Wis­con­sin­ers want to im­peach him.</p>
    <p>What changed? The Ge­or­gia run-off elec­tions, which the GOP lost, thanks largely to Mr Trump’s toxic touch, and the sheer Wash­ing­ton may­hem of Jan 6.</p>
    <p>There is still no telling where the GOP train will end up, how­ever. The ques­tion still re­mains: Will South Carolina Sen­a­tor Lind­sey Gra­ham’s May 3, 2016 pre­dic­tion – “If we nom­i­nate Trump, we will get de­stroyed... and we will de­serve it” – prove ul­ti­mately true or not?</p>
    <p>The caul­dron of pop­ulist re­sent­ment in the US has not burned its last, or more than 74 mil­lion Amer­i­cans would not have voted to re-elect a man not fit for of­fice in the first place.</p>
    <p>But that same da­tum also proves some­thing that the Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal cen­tre must ac­knowl­edge: Just hav­ing an ide­al­ist view of the hu­man na­ture and the best of in­ten­tions does not ex­on­er­ate all forms of base­less self-re­gard, self-deal­ing, and self-in­dul­gence. If right-wing pop­ulism con­tin­ues to grow and to buoy up the for­mer pres­i­dent’s power with it, it will not be for no rea­son.</p>
