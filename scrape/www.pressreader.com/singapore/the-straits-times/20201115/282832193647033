    <p>• World No. 1 Dustin John­son and third-ranked Justin Thomas fig­ure it might take an un­usual ap­proach to win the Masters, play­ing ag­gres­sive and toss­ing out what might nor­mally work.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can duo were tied for the sec­ond-round lead on nine-un­der 135 with Aus­tralian Cameron Smith, Mex­ico’s Abra­ham Ancer and Spain’s world No. 2 Jon Rahm in a bunched-up leader­board.</p>
    <p>They were one stroke ahead of a an­other group of five – Asians Im Sung-jae of South Korea, Ja­pan’s Hideki Mat­suyama, Chi­nese Taipei’s C.T. Pan, and Amer­i­cans Pa­trick Cant­lay and Pa­trick Reed.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing cham­pion Tiger Woods, who had a 68 in the first round, carded a 71 in yes­ter­day’s de­layed sec­ond round and was four shots back of the lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Four-time Ma­jor win­ner Rory McIl­roy, seek­ing a green jacket to com­plete a ca­reer Grand Slam, had a 75 on Friday, then re­bounded with a bo­gey-free 66 to re­vive his chances.</p>
    <p>Re­sults from the third round were not avail­able by press time.</p>
    <p>Pre-tour­na­ment favourite Bryson DeCham­beau made the cut with noth­ing to spare, nine shots back after bo­gey­ing his fi­nal two holes. He later said he had been feel­ing “weird” and took a coro­n­avirus test on Friday night as a pre­cau­tion. It came back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>John­son and Thomas hope to win the green jacket for a sec­ond Ma­jor – the for­mer after his 2016 US Open ti­tle and the lat­ter after his 2017 PGA Cham­pi­onship win.</p>
    <p>Thomas has watched shots do un­usual things the last two days, a mix of rain-soft­ened con­di­tions and au­tumn weather need­ing adap­ta­tion from lessons learnt over time at Augusta Na­tional.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lot softer and a lot more scorable, but it re­ally has just come down to ex­e­cut­ing a lit­tle bit bet­ter and min­imis­ing the mis­takes,” said Thomas.</p>
    <p>“You re­ally throw all past knowl­edge out the win­dow, as weird as that is.</p>
    <p>“It’s not like I’m the only one that has to ad­just or may be un­com­fort­able in cer­tain sit­u­a­tions. The en­tire field is deal­ing with the same thing.”</p>
    <p>John­son, try­ing to be­come the first top-ranked Masters win­ner since Woods in 2002, is happy with his shot­mak­ing. But he fig­ures he must keep an at­tack­ing mind­set even as the course be­comes firmer after show­ers.</p>
    <p>“We’re still go­ing to have to go out,” said John­son, the PGA Player of the Year after winning the Tour Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be soft enough to where you’re go­ing to have to at­tack the course and play ag­gres­sive and keep swing­ing like I am.</p>
    <p>“I like where I’m at. I like my po­si­tion head­ing into the week­end.”</p>
    <p>He has been run­ner-up in three of the past six Ma­jors and will fo­cus on the par-five holes, hop­ing his long-driv­ing game helps make the dif­fer­ence. “I’m happy with the way I’m swing­ing it, how I’m con­trol­ling the golf ball and ev­ery­thing I’m do­ing,” he said</p>
    <p>Rahm was among 48 play­ers who had to fin­ish their sec­ond rounds and was pre­pared for a long week­end of golf with chang­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“I came out to­day and it felt like a dif­fer­ent putt with the greens be­ing a lot faster,” he said.</p>
