    <p>Four more foreigners have had their work passes re­voked for breach­ing stay-home no­tice (SHN) re­quire­ments in the past three months, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They left their places of res­i­dence with­out valid rea­sons and with­out seek­ing MOM’s per­mis­sion dur­ing their SHN pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Among the four, three are work per­mit hold­ers and one is an S-Pass holder, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Two of the four, who left their SHN res­i­dences, were de­tected by the MOM-is­sued smart­watch. The de­vice alerts MOM if its wearer leaves his place of res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Once a worker clears im­mi­gra­tion, of­fi­cers tag him with it and make sure it is func­tional, af­ter which the de­vice is locked and can­not be re­moved un­til the SHN pe­riod ends. It uses GPS and 4G tech­nol­ogy, and can tech­ni­cally track the wearer’s spe­cific lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Any at­tempt to tam­per with the smart­watch or re­move it will trig­ger an alert to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The other two foreigners stayed at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties dur­ing their SHN and were not re­quired to wear the smart­watch. They were re­ported by a mem­ber of the pub­lic and an em­ployer.</p>
    <p>Since May 1, MOM has re­voked 44 work passes for breach of SHN re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>In June, six peo­ple were fined for breach­ing cir­cuit breaker mea­sures at Robert­son Quay in May, and had their work passes re­voked.</p>
    <p>MOM re­minded all work pass hold­ers and their em­ploy­ers to com­ply with the quar­an­tine or­der or SHN re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Those who fail to do so, in­clud­ing per­sons who tam­per with and/or re­move the elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing de­vice dur­ing the quar­an­tine or SHN pe­riod will be li­able to pros­e­cu­tion un­der the In­fec­tious Diseases (Covid-19 – Stay Orders) Reg­u­la­tions 2020.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that it will con­tinue to take en­force­ment ac­tion against work pass hold­ers who do not com­ply with the re­quire­ments, in­clud­ing re­vok­ing work passes.</p>
