    <p>Rapid test­ing be­ing con­ducted at larger events has yet to pick up any pos­i­tive Covid-19 cases, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Ken­neth Mak, direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices at the Min­istry of Health (MOH), said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is pi­lot­ing the use of these tests as an im­por­tant part of its strat­egy in con­tain­ing the coro­n­avirus, which will al­low for larger gath­er­ings in phase three of its re­open­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>The anti­gen rapid tests give re­sults within half an hour, en­abling cases to be quickly de­tected and peo­ple who are pos­i­tive to be iso­lated.</p>
    <p>“These tests have not yet yielded pos­i­tive re­sults, but this is con­sis­tent with the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion that we have, where the com­mu­nity preva­lence rate in Sin­ga­pore is very low,” said Prof Mak at yes­ter­day’s vir­tual multi-min­istry Covid-19 task force brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“We’ve used these pi­lot (tests) as a means of val­i­dat­ing our pro­cesses in terms of how we would or­gan­ise test­ing to be done, ei­ther on site or off site be­fore the event, with cer­tifi­cates is­sued, and then al­low­ing en­try into these events.”</p>
    <p>The tests were in­tro­duced in a pi­lot scheme late last month, and were tried out at events such as Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week and the ONE Cham­pi­onship mixed mar­tial arts events.</p>
    <p>On the first day of Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week, swab­bers at a test­ing sta­tion took nasal swabs from 215 par­tic­i­pants by in­sert­ing a swab stick about 2.5cm long up their nos­trils and twirling it sev­eral times. Par­tic­i­pants waited about 15 to 30 min­utes for their re­sults, which were sent via SMS.</p>
    <p>The test, pro­vided as part of the pi­lot scheme, was free of charge to par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said at the same brief­ing: “We will con­tinue to pi­lot dif­fer­ent work­flows in var­i­ous set­tings, such as at more busi­ness-to-busi­ness events, live per­for­mances, as well as spec­ta­tor sports, and pre-event test­ing can form part of our strat­egy against Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>More types of rapid tests will also be tried out to ex­pand the MOH’s ar­moury, said Prof Mak, “so that there’s a greater de­gree of choice and greater ca­pac­ity that we will have in place to al­low more of such test­ing to take place”.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid tests are less ac­cu­rate than poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests, which are used to con­firm cases and re­main the gold stan­dard in Covid-19 test­ing.</p>
    <p>Hence, any pos­i­tive re­sults that are picked up from anti­gen rapid tests will still have to be val­i­dated and con­firmed us­ing PCR tests, said Prof Mak.</p>
    <p>Such rapid tests de­tect spe­cific pro­teins – known as anti­gens – on the virus’ sur­face while PCR tests de­tect the ge­netic ma­te­rial of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>As these anti­gen rapid tests will not pick up ev­ery sin­gle Covid-19 case, there is still a need to ad­here to the same safe man­age­ment mea­sures such as mask wear­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing, group size and ca­pac­ity lim­its at events.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak also said the costs of rapid tests have come down, and they are look­ing to see if they can re­duce the costs as­so­ci­ated with hav­ing them con­ducted en masse.</p>
    <p>“We are in­creas­ing the ac­cess to these tests, by de­cen­tral­is­ing and al­low­ing more pri­vate test providers to make these tests avail­able to mem­bers of the pub­lic,” he said.</p>
    <p>“These tests will not be sub­sidised and the cost would be paid for by those who seek these tests at these pri­vate labs.”</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the Covid-19 task force, said at the brief­ing that Sin­ga­pore is con­sid­er­ing whether to make it manda­tory for some events to pro­vide anti­gen rapid tests.</p>
    <p>“If and when we make preevent or pre-en­try test­ing a re­quire­ment for cer­tain larger-scale ac­tiv­i­ties to hap­pen in phase three, then, in­deed, the or­gan­is­ers of the events can avail them­selves to the anti­gen-test­ing pro­to­cols that are al­ready avail­able in the mar­ket at that time,” he said.</p>
    <p>As these anti­gen rapid tests will not pick up ev­ery sin­gle Covid-19 case, there is still a need to ad­here to the same safe man­age­ment mea­sures such as mask wear­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing, group size and ca­pac­ity lim­its at events.</p>
