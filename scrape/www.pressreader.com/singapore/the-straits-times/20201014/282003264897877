    <p>The United Na­tions marks its 75th an­niver­sary this year with a mixed record of achieve­ments and fail­ures. One of the less known suc­cess sto­ries is the link be­tween the UN and re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Ar­ti­cle 52 of the UN Char­ter refers, with ap­proval, to re­gional ar­range­ments, which sup­port the pur­poses and prin­ci­ples of the UN. Asean and the Euro­pean Union are two re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tions which read­ily come to mind – both sup­port the ob­jec­tives of the UN by main­tain­ing peace in their re­spec­tive re­gions, by pre­vent­ing armed con­flict, by em­pow­er­ing their cit­i­zens, and by rais­ing the stan­dards of liv­ing of their peo­ples.</p>
    <p>Asean is the most suc­cess­ful re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tion in Asia. The Euro­pean Union is the most suc­cess­ful re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tion in Europe and, per­haps, in the world.</p>
    <p>And yet, de­spite the many ties that bind these two in­sti­tu­tions, the re­la­tion­ship be­tween them is lit­tle known to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is cur­rently the Asean co­or­di­na­tor of the Asean-EU re­la­tion­ship. Given the paucity of lit­er­a­ture on the sub­ject, we have de­cided to edit a new book, en­ti­tled Asean And EU: The Un­told Story, which will be launched to­mor­row. One of the fea­tures of the book is that all its writ­ers are from Asean – com­pris­ing di­plo­mats, jour­nal­ists and an­a­lysts from univer­si­ties and think-tanks.</p>
    <p>In this es­say, we wish to share 10 lit­tle-known facts about that re­la­tion­ship, the many facets of which are am­pli­fied in the book.</p>
    <p>1. The sim­i­lar­i­ties</p>
    <p>The big­gest sim­i­lar­ity be­tween Asean and the EU is that they are ded­i­cated to main­tain­ing peace in their re­spec­tive re­gions. The EU was awarded the No­bel Peace Prize in 2012. We hope that one day Asean will also re­ceive the No­bel Peace Prize for keep­ing the peace in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Another sim­i­lar­ity is in­te­grat­ing the economies of its mem­ber states into a sin­gle mar­ket. The pur­pose of in­te­gra­tion is to en­hance the wel­fare of their peo­ple and to have stronger ne­go­ti­at­ing power. The Euro­pean sin­gle mar­ket has more than 450 mil­lion con­sumers.</p>
    <p>The Asean eco­nomic com­mu­nity has more than 650 mil­lion con­sumers.</p>
    <p>2. The dif­fer­ences</p>
    <p>The big­gest dif­fer­ence be­tween them is that Asean is an in­ter-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion and the EU is a supra­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tion. In the case of the EU, its mem­ber states have pooled their sovereignt­y in cer­tain ar­eas, such as trade and en­vi­ron­ment. They have in­sti­tu­tions such as a Par­lia­ment, a court, a sin­gle cur­rency and a for­eign ser­vice which Asean does not have. The Asean Sec­re­tar­iat, with fewer than 400 staff, is tiny com­pared with the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion (EC) with more than 23,000 per­son­nel. Asean’s an­nual bud­get of about US$20 mil­lion (S$27 mil­lion) is mi­nus­cule com­pared with that of the EU Com­mis­sion, with a bud­get of about US$180 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>3. Di­a­logue part­ners</p>
    <p>The EU is one of Asean’s old­est di­a­logue part­ners. They en­tered a re­la­tion­ship in 1972. This re­la­tion­ship was for­malised in 1977. With the sign­ing of the Asean-EC Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment in 1980, the re­la­tion­ship has grown to en­com­pass co­op­er­a­tion in many fields, in­clud­ing eco­nom­ics, devel­op­ment, po­lit­i­cal and se­cu­rity di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>The two sides have agreed, in prin­ci­ple, to be­come “strate­gic part­ners”.</p>
    <p>4. In­vest­ments</p>
    <p>Asean’s largest for­eign in­vestor is not the US, China or Ja­pan. It is the EU. In 2017, the EU held an in­vest­ment stock of €337 bil­lion or US$398 bil­lion in the re­gion. The EU’s com­pa­nies have been in­vest­ing ap­prox­i­mately €15 bil­lion or US$17.7 bil­lion in Asean, an­nu­ally, since 2004.</p>
    <p>5. Trade</p>
    <p>Trade is boom­ing be­tween Asean and the EU. The EU is Asean’s sec­ond big­gest trad­ing part­ner, af­ter China. Asean is the EU’s third largest non-Euro­pean trad­ing part­ner, af­ter the US and China. In 2018, the to­tal trade be­tween the EU and Asean ex­ceeded €237 bil­lion or US$280 bil­lion. The EU has suc­cess­fully con­cluded free trade agree­ments with two Asean mem­bers, Sin­ga­pore and Viet­nam, which are in force.</p>
    <p>6. Devel­op­ment aid</p>
    <p>The EU and its mem­ber states are the world’s largest donor of devel­op­ment aid to the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. In 2019, the col­lec­tive of­fi­cial devel­op­ment as­sis­tance (ODA) from the EU and its mem­ber states amounted to €75.2 bil­lion or US$89 bil­lion, rep­re­sent­ing more than 55 per cent of to­tal global aid.</p>
    <p>They are also the largest donor of aid to Asean. The less de­vel­oped mem­bers of Asean, such as Cam­bo­dia, Laos, Myan­mar and Viet­nam, still need the help of ODA in their devel­op­ment. To fight Covid-19 and to mit­i­gate its so­cial and eco­nomic im­pact, the EU has pledged to do­nate €800 mil­lion or US$946 mil­lion to help Asean.</p>
    <p>7. Free trade agree­ment</p>
    <p>In 2017, Asean and the EU agreed to re­launch ne­go­ti­a­tions for an Asean-EU Free Trade Agree­ment. An FTA be­tween them will cre­ate a com­bined mar­ket of more than a bil­lion con­sumers and would be warmly wel­comed by the busi­ness com­mu­ni­ties of the two re­gions.</p>
    <p>To be sure, there are dif­fi­cult is­sues in such a ne­go­ti­a­tion. But, with po­lit­i­cal good­will, ev­ery dif­fi­culty has a so­lu­tion. With­out good­will, ev­ery so­lu­tion has a dif­fi­culty.</p>
    <p>8. Open skies</p>
    <p>Asean and the EU are ne­go­ti­at­ing an Asean-EU Com­pre­hen­sive Air Trans­port Agree­ment. The am­bi­tion is to con­clude an open skies agree­ment be­tween the two re­gions. This would be a boon to our trav­ellers. It would also help the avi­a­tion in­dus­try which has been dev­as­tated by Covid-19 and the re­stric­tions on travel. We should ex­pe­dite the ne­go­ti­a­tions to con­clude this im­por­tant agree­ment to give a much-needed boost to our avi­a­tion and travel in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>9. Human rights</p>
    <p>There are, of course, some is­sues on which Asean and EU have dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives. One such is­sue is over the plight of the Ro­hingyas in Myan­mar. Due to the Asean prin­ci­ple of non-in­ter­fer­ence in the in­ter­nal af­fairs of other states, Asean can only of­fer hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance to the Ro­hingya refugees but can­not con­front Myan­mar on the root cause of the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The EU has no such con­straint. It has of­ten used trade and devel­op­ment as­sis­tance as an in­stru­ment to put pres­sure on coun­tries to im­prove their human rights records. Asean be­lieves in en­gage­ment and does not be­lieve in us­ing sanc­tions. The EU is pre­pared to use sanc­tions when en­gage­ment fails to bring about the de­sired out­come.</p>
    <p>10. Com­mon val­ues and in­ter­ests</p>
    <p>Asean and the EU share many com­mon in­ter­ests. They cham­pion open economies, free trade and re­gional eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion. They sup­port the rule of law and the rules-based in­ter­na­tional or­der. They pre­fer mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism to uni­lat­er­al­ism. They should there­fore work to­gether in ar­eas such as cli­mate change, dig­i­tal econ­omy, smart cities, cy­ber se­cu­rity, eq­ui­table ac­cess to vac­cines, pub­lic health and pan­demics pre­pared­ness.</p>
    <p>In the 2020 ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute sur­vey on the state of South-east Asia, the EU was Asean’s sec­ond most trusted part­ner, af­ter Ja­pan. There is there­fore much good­will in Asean to­wards the EU. The EU should take ad­van­tage of this happy po­si­tion to raise the game with Asean.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead</p>
    <p>Given the many ar­eas where Asean and the EU share a com­mon vi­sion and the press­ing is­sues of our times, we urge both par­ties to be more am­bi­tious. They should not be con­tent with what they have al­ready achieved. They should ne­go­ti­ate and con­clude ex­pe­di­tiously the Asean-EU Free Trade Agree­ment and the Asean-EU Com­pre­hen­sive Air Trans­port Agree­ment. The con­clu­sion of those agree­ments will bring new en­ergy to the re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, the two sides should step up co­op­er­a­tion on both old and new is­sues. These in­clude fight­ing against Covid-19 vac­cine na­tion­al­ism, pre­vent­ing the fu­ture oc­cur­rence of pan­demics and threats to pub­lic health, pro­mot­ing the growth of the dig­i­tal econ­omy and smart cities, and re­in­forc­ing cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, it is im­por­tant for the lead­ers of Asean and the EU to close ranks and stand united against pro­tec­tion­ism, iso­la­tion­ism and uni­lat­er­al­ism. They should also cham­pion free trade, re­gional in­te­gra­tion and mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism. By do­ing so, they would con­tinue liv­ing up to their mis­sion of fos­ter­ing the UN ob­jec­tives of main­tain­ing peace and safe­guard­ing the wel­fare of their peo­ples.</p>
