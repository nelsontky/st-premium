    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A In 2000, I re­ceived a pushy sales call from a bro­ker to buy into sev­eral heat­ing oil call op­tions. (A call op­tion gives the pur­chaser the right but not the obli­ga­tion to pur­chase the un­der­ly­ing fu­tures con­tract for a spe­cific time pe­riod and price.) It was the big­gest sales po­si­tion I had ever taken at that time, and I lost US$3,000 (S$4,050) from that in­vest­ment, which was a lot of money for me then. I was 27.</p>
    <p>But I learnt a valu­able les­son from that ex­pe­ri­ence. There is no such thing as a quick win and in­vest­ing is a long-term strat­egy.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A My best in­vest­ment has been in</p>
    <p>Singlife, in which about 80 per cent of my port­fo­lio is com­mit­ted. No other use of my per­sonal cap­i­tal has yielded bet­ter re­turns than the early suc­cess of Singlife has.</p>
    <p>As many en­trepreneur­s would know, it can be chal­leng­ing to raise money for start-ups, and in­vestors want to see founders com­mit­ted, and so I com­mit­ted my sav­ings to in­vest in the com­pany.</p>
    <p>There is nat­u­rally more at stake when you have a fam­ily to look after, but if it had not worked out, I was con­fi­dent I could re­build my wealth through a dif­fer­ent role in the insurance in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>But with the help of the awe­some and pas­sion­ate peo­ple that have helped to build the firm, we have reached many mile­stones of suc­cess to­gether and made the business what it is to­day.</p>
