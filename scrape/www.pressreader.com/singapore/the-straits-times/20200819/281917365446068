    <p>MOGADISHU • Tai­wan has opened a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of­fice in the break­away state of So­ma­liland, a sign of deep­en­ing ties be­tween two sides that are de­nied widespread in­ter­na­tional recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>The flags of both sides were hoisted and of­fi­cials sang their re­spec­tive an­thems dur­ing a cer­e­mony on Mon­day at the of­fice in the So­ma­liland cap­i­tal Hargeisa.</p>
    <p>“We are con­fi­dent about the mu­tual ben­e­fi­cial and friendly ties with So­ma­liland,” Tai­wanese rep­re­sen­ta­tive Lou Chen-hwa, who will head the of­fice, said.</p>
    <p>He added that the two sides planned to co­op­er­ate on every­thing from health­care to agri­cul­ture and se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment to es­tab­lish the new of­fice was an­nounced last month, and So­ma­liland is ex­pected to open its of­fice in Taipei soon.</p>
    <p>So­ma­liland’s For­eign Min­is­ter Yasin Haji Mo­hamoud told reporters on Mon­day that an am­bas­sador was “al­ready work­ing” on set­ting it up.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan is of­fi­cially recog­nised by only 15 coun­tries – seven of its diplo­matic al­lies switched to es­tab­lish for­mal ties with China after Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen came to power in 2016.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai de­scribes Tai­wan as al­ready in­de­pen­dent, but China, which views Tai­wan as its own ter­ri­tory, has vowed to seize it one day, by force if nec­es­sary, es­pe­cially if the is­land for­mally de­clares in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has for decades been en­gaged in a diplo­matic tug of war with Bei­jing in which each side tries to woo the other’s al­lies with fi­nan­cial and other in­cen­tives.</p>
    <p>So­ma­liland de­clared in­de­pen­dence from So­ma­lia in 1991 in a move that re­mains un­recog­nised by the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>So­ma­liland and Tai­wan are in some ways “nat­u­ral part­ners”, es­pe­cially as Bei­jing has been re­luc­tant to en­gage with So­ma­liland be­cause of its un­recog­nised sta­tus, said Mr Omar Mah­mood, se­nior So­ma­lia an­a­lyst for In­ter­na­tional Cri­sis Group.</p>
