    <p>Jour­nal­ists have a key role to play in fight­ing present and fu­ture pan­demics, par­tic­u­larly in tack­ling the ver­i­ta­ble flood of in­for­ma­tion – called an “in­fo­demic” – they bring along, said Dr Sylvie Briand, di­rec­tor of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Global In­fec­tious Hazard Pre­pared­ness depart­ment, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Epi­demics bring a lot of fear and un­cer­tainty... now (that) every­body is con­nected and can have 24/7 ac­cess to news and in­for­ma­tion. So it’s very hard to man­age this tsunami of in­for­ma­tion that we call an in­fo­demic,” said Dr Briand at the vir­tual Science in the News­room Global Sum­mit 2020.</p>
    <p>The in­au­gu­ral two-day event, which kicked off yes­ter­day, is hosted by the World Ed­i­tors Fo­rum and aims to help news­rooms pre­pare for fu­ture science or health-re­lated crises. Sup­ported by Te­masek Foun­da­tion, it seeks to bridge gaps in health and science re­port­ing skills, and build greater trust in the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dr Briand said the in­fo­demic nec­es­sar­ily car­ries a lot of false and mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion – made over­whelm­ingly ob­vi­ous dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break. This can lead to con­fu­sion. In­ac­cu­rate in­for­ma­tion can be dan­ger­ous and re­sult in people tak­ing mis­in­formed risks, she said. This hap­pened in Iran, where thou­sands of people drank toxic methanol in an at­tempt to shield them­selves from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mis­in­for­ma­tion also erodes trust in gov­ern­ment, pub­lic health au­thor­i­ties and in science, Dr Briand added. She said in that ev­ery epi­demic, three types of ru­mours tend to cir­cu­late: about the ori­gin of the dis­ease; whether it ac­tu­ally ex­ists or if the pan­demic is made up; and the kinds of mea­sures that can be taken to fight it.</p>
    <p>“This is where jour­nal­ists can re­ally help, be­cause jour­nal­ists are (the) me­di­a­tor be­tween the science and the pop­u­la­tion. They have a very im­por­tant role to play to dis­til the science, ex­plain how the sci­en­tific process works, and how it’s nor­mal dur­ing a new pan­demic or epi­demic to have un­cer­tain­ties.”</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ists also play a key role in help­ing to mit­i­gate this fear, re­as­sur­ing the pub­lic while re­main­ing trans­par­ent about the risk posed by the dis­ease, said Dr Briand.</p>
    <p>Two other ex­perts also gave their views dur­ing the ses­sion, mod­er­ated by Straits Times se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Denise Lieves­ley, for­mer prin­ci­pal and cur­rent hon­orary fel­low at Green Tem­ple­ton Col­lege at the Univer­sity of Ox­ford, said re­porters can help the pub­lic bet­ter un­der­stand the sta­tis­tics used dur­ing a pub­lic health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple, she said, is the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment turn­ing the num­ber of Covid-19 tests ad­min­is­tered into a target. Prof Lieves­ley said: “It be­came a po­lit­i­cal is­sue, rather than a good mea­sure that helped us de­sign bet­ter sys­tems.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Pro­fes­sor Car­los Goncalo das Neves, di­rec­tor of re­search and in­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion at the Nor­we­gian Ve­teri­nary In­sti­tute, said jour­nal­ists can also help pre­vent the next pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that jour­nal­ists need to work closely with sci­en­tists when cov­er­ing sci­en­tific stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“It might be good science if it gets pub­lished in Na­ture. But it’s only (con­sid­ered) the truth if it’s on BBC or The Straits Times... if (the mes­sage) gets spread the right way, it has the po­ten­tial to touch people like never be­fore,” he said.</p>
