    <p>An ad­vi­sory to help em­ploy­ers im­prove their staff’s men­tal well­be­ing will be pub­lished by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>It will high­light notable ini­tia­tives for com­pa­nies to em­u­late, such as giv­ing ac­cess to anonymised ex­ter­nal coun­selling ser­vices, as well as train­ing su­per­vi­sors to iden­tify symp­toms of men­tal health is­sues early.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion by Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas), Senior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad said yes­ter­day that the Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Men­tal Health is cur­rently un­der­go­ing con­sul­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) is work­ing with em­ploy­ers, unions, men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als and civil so­ci­ety groups, in­clud­ing the Youth Well­be­ing Net­work.</p>
    <p>The idea be­hind such rec­om­men­da­tions for em­ploy­ers was dis­cussed in March dur­ing MOM’s Com­mit­tee of Sup­ply de­bates.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy noted then that an ad­vi­sory would ed­u­cate em­ploy­ers on how they can best sup­port their em­ploy­ees’ men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>He said yes­ter­day that the In­ter­A­gency Ad­vi­sory on sup­port­ing men­tal well-be­ing of work­ers un­der Covid-19 work ar­range­ments, pub­lished in April, might serve as a use­ful ref­er­ence.</p>
    <p>It con­tains a list of ex­ter­nal re­sources that em­ploy­ers can con­sider en­gag­ing to pro­vide sup­port for their work­ers’ men­tal health.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers can also ini­ti­ate sup­port for their work­ers.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, su­per­vi­sors can check in reg­u­larly with their work­ers, talk to them to find out if they are fac­ing any prob­lems, and re­fer them to ex­ter­nal help if needed,” added Mr Zaqy.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong also asked if the Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory would ad­dress the right of em­ploy­ees to dis­con­nect from work out­side of the work hours, as the cur­rent pro­longed telecom­mut­ing ar­range­ments have blurred bound­aries be­tween the home and the of­fice for many work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Many have told me that they now work in­creas­ingly long hours as e-mails, calls and What­sApp mes­sages have come in out­side of their reg­u­lar work­ing hours. Some shared that they now have Zoom work meet­ings in the night, which they never had be­fore Covid-19,” he said.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Zaqy ac­knowl­edged that the cur­rent work­from-home ar­range­ments have blurred the lines be­tween work hours and per­sonal time, and said it is im­por­tant for the Gov­ern­ment to ex­am­ine how to bet­ter man­age work-life bal­ance.</p>
    <p>But he noted that such a “right to dis­con­nect” law is rel­a­tively new around the world, with many coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, still ob­serv­ing its out­comes.</p>
    <p>“We must con­sider whether some­thing like this would be rel­e­vant or rigid in Sin­ga­pore’s con­text, given that many of us do work for multi­na­tional firms or firms that work across time zones,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also pointed out that en­forc­ing work hours rigidly may neg­a­tively im­pact work­ers who cur­rently en­joy the flex­i­bil­ity of run­ning er­rands dur­ing the day and work­ing at night in­stead.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he ac­knowl­edged that such con­cerns are im­por­tant and could be raised as part of the dis­cus­sion on the ad­vi­sory.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) also asked if the ad­vi­sory would clearly state that em­ploy­ers should not re­quest in­for­ma­tion on a per­son’s men­tal health con­di­tion un­less the con­di­tion has a di­rect con­nec­tion with their abil­ity to per­form their job.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Zaqy said: “The Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory has not been an­nounced, I can’t con­firm. But cer­tainly we’ll look into it.”</p>
    <p>He added that em­ploy­ers are cur­rently al­ready dis­cour­aged from ask­ing for such in­for­ma­tion dur­ing the em­ploy­ment ap­pli­ca­tion process, where the job does not re­quire it.</p>
    <p>“This is some­thing that I think we need to hold strong to... rest as­sured... we want to make sure that the well-be­ing of our work­ers is pro­tected, both from the phys­i­cal health state as well as the men­tal health state,” he said.</p>
