    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You need to dive into this bold new ad­ven­ture with­out think­ing twice. Your amaz­ing per­sonal en­ergy should guar­an­tee a safe land­ing.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You and your al­lies need to meet. Your en­ergy is just right for ral­ly­ing the troops and get­ting ev­ery­one to em­brace the same cause.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are tak­ing you far too se­ri­ously – so do what you can to demon­strate that you are just jok­ing. Of course, if it is time for real talk, that should come eas­ily.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Do not think too hard about that big pur­chase or de­ci­sion – you de­serve it. The time may not feel right but, as long as the lo­gis­tics work out, go for it.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Show the world what it is miss­ing when you and your big heart are not around. Share your cook­ies and your hopes with those who need them most.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your big plans need extra juice, so en­list some sup­port or spend some extra time fig­ur­ing out all the tiny de­tails. This will be time and en­ergy well spent.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your cre­ative juices are flow­ing, so make sure that your hottest ideas are out there for public view­ing. At least one of them is sure to catch on quickly.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Keep your de­sires to your­self for the time be­ing. Peo­ple are less in­clined to see things your way at the mo­ment, but once that is over, it will be clear sail­ing.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your cre­ative side is putting in long hours with­out your hav­ing to lift a fin­ger. If you want to work on those great ideas, you should make se­ri­ous head­way.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are too de­mand­ing. Try to just roll with the punches and do as much as you can, but ex­pect to be tired by the end of the day.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You need to deal with some­thing big and sud­den, but that can be fun. Though your world may tem­po­rar­ily turn up­side down, you are glad not to be bored.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Co-work­ers may prove more trou­ble than they are worth – try to go it alone, if at all pos­si­ble. If you are look­ing for work, try new places in­stead of net­work­ing.</p>
