        <p>Six days into serv­ing her stay-home no­tice af­ter ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore on Dec 21 last year, a new maid from In­done­sia started feel­ing un­well.</p>
        <p>The sin­gle mother, 40, who had left home for the first time to start a new life as a for­eign do­mes­tic worker (FDW), de­vel­oped a mild cough and headache while be­ing con­fined at the Gent­ing Ho­tel Jurong.</p>
        <p>On Jan 3, she was given a nasal swab test, and her worst fears were re­alised when she tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
        <p>“I was so afraid,” the Surabaya na­tive, who wanted to be known only as Nu­rul, told The New Pa­per over the phone last week from a quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity in Tuas.</p>
        <p>“I did not know whether I would be able to start my new job and was also con­cerned for my health,” she said through a trans­la­tor. “I felt alone. I was miss­ing my fam­ily, es­pe­cially my two-year-old son whom I had not seen in three months.”</p>
        <p>To Ms Nu­rul’s re­lief, her agent re­as­sured her that she could start work af­ter re­cov­er­ing as her em­ployer was will­ing to em­ploy her.</p>
        <p>The em­ployer, who de­clined to be named, told TNP she still has con­cerns over whether Nu­rul would re­main in­fec­tious af­ter her re­cov­ery, be­cause her el­derly mother is sickly. But it is dif­fi­cult to get a re­place­ment maid at short no­tice, so she is prepared to cope by tak­ing pre­cau­tions such as hav­ing Nu­rul wear a mask when tend­ing to her mother.</p>
        <p>The mother of three, who is cur­rently job­less, added: “It has been frus­trat­ing. We have not had a maid for about 10 months and I have had to turn down a job of­fer to take care of my chil­dren and mother.”</p>
        <p>Amid the pan­demic, such sit­u­a­tions and frus­tra­tions are not un­com­mon.</p>
        <p>Nu­rul is among 130 new and re­turn­ing FDWs who tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus be­tween Dec 23 and Jan 9. Most of the re­cent new in­fec­tions here are im­ported cases.</p>
        <p>To gain en­try into Sin­ga­pore, mi­grant work­ers from most coun­tries must have a valid neg­a­tive test re­sult from an ac­cred­ited or recog­nised lab­o­ra­tory taken within 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture. Re­cov­ered pa­tients need not take the pre-de­par­ture test but must pro­duce doc­u­men­ta­tion with the date of the first pos­i­tive test re­sult taken be­tween 22 and 180 days be­fore the date of ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
        <p>Last Novem­ber, the Min­istry of Man­power told TNP that while pre-de­par­ture tests will not elim­i­nate all im­ported cases, they should help limit the num­bers over the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>CON­TACT WITH OTH­ERS</p>
        <p>Maid Av­enue gen­eral man­ager Wil­liam Lau said there could be oc­ca­sions af­ter the pre-de­par­ture test where the maid may come into con­tact with an in­fected per­son. He told TNP: “Given that the test can be taken up to 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture, maids may still be able to con­tract Covid-19 from those who are stay­ing with them in the board­ing house.</p>
        <p>“They may also get it dur­ing their flight or ferry ride here.</p>
        <p>“An­other rea­son could be that some maids share a dou­ble room dur­ing their stay-home no­tice here, ex­pos­ing them to some level of risk.”</p>
        <p>Uni­ver­sal Em­ploy­ment Agency direc­tor Leong Kim Huey said: “It is hard to en­sure the au­then­tic­ity of tests done out­side Sin­ga­pore, so the num­ber of FDWs test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 is not sur­pris­ing.”</p>
        <p>De­spite the num­ber of FDWs test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in re­cent weeks, Ms Flora Sha, who man­ages United Chan­nel maid agency, be­lieves they will still be in de­mand. “Fam­i­lies in Sin­ga­pore still re­quire full­time helpers to as­sist them with their needs, es­pe­cially those who need ur­gent care for the el­derly,” she said.</p>
        <p>High­light­ing a move to give em­ploy­ers peace of mind, Ms Sha said it is now com­pul­sory for em­ploy­ers to buy med­i­cal in­sur­ance with a cov­er­age of at least $10,000 for the FDW’s med­i­cal ex­penses in case she de­vel­ops Covid-19 symp­toms or tests pos­i­tive within 14 days of ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore. The in­sur­ance must be bought be­fore the FDW ar­rives here.</p>
