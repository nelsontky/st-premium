    <p>HONG KONG • China’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law has cast a threat­en­ing shadow over Hong Kong’s dy­namic book in­dus­try, with anx­ious pub­lish­ers comb­ing through back cat­a­logues for po­ten­tially “sub­ver­sive” ma­te­rial, and look­ing to Tai­wan as a safe haven for print­ing fresh ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has l ong been a refuge for in­tel­lec­tu­als, free from the grip of the Chi­nese main­land’s com­mu­nist lead­ers.</p>
    <p>But that sta­tus is at risk of crum­bling as Bei­jing’s se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion sends fresh jit­ters through a pub­lish­ing in­dus­try al­ready wary of over­step­ping China’s red lines.</p>
    <p>“Ma­jor pub­lish­ing and print­ing houses now dare not touch a project like ours,” said Woody, who asked to be iden­ti­fied only by his first name and is one of a group of jour­nal­ists putting to­gether a book of in­ter­views with wit­nesses of Hong Kong’s vi­o­lent pro-democ­racy protests last year.</p>
    <p>The team was forced to re­view the en­tire con­tents of the ti­tle –</p>
    <p>Our Last Evo­lu­tion – af­ter Bei­jing served no­tice of the law in June, and three writ­ers sub­se­quently re­quested changes.</p>
    <p>“For the rest, it’s not that they don’t have any fear, they just don’t know what specif­i­cally they should worry about,” he said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has made no se­cret of its dis­like of the books that roll off print­ing presses in Hong Kong, of­ten paint­ing an un­flat­ter­ing and at times sala­cious pic­ture of many Chi­nese of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>In 2015, five Hong Kong book­sell­ers of­fer­ing gos­sip-filled tomes van­ished – in­clud­ing one from Thai­land – be­fore resur­fac­ing in main­land cus­tody making “con­fes­sions”. The cli­mate of fear has only in­ten­si­fied un­der the new law, which tar­gets se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces.</p>
    <p>Breakazine, a quar­terly mag­a­zine ex­plor­ing so­cial prob­lems in Hong Kong, can­celled pub­li­ca­tion of its lat­est is­sue and sus­pended pro­duc­tion of the next one.</p>
    <p>It said it had ob­tained le­gal opin­ion and was forced to act due to “un­cer­tain­ties” in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>The an­swer, say some pub­lish­ers, is Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Taipei pub­lisher Liu Gi said the Our Last Evo­lu­tion team was one of a num­ber work­ing on books about the Hong Kong protests that came knock­ing on his door in June as the law was be­ing for­mu­lated.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu, who runs Alone Pub­lish­ing as a one-man op­er­a­tion, said it sig­nalled an ironic switch for Hong Kong, which pre­vi­ously served as a pub­lish­ing haven for Tai­wanese lit­er­a­ture when the is­land en­dured decades of au­thor­i­tar­ian rule.</p>
    <p>“It ap­pears to me that his­tory is re­peat­ing it­self in a re­versed way,” Mr Liu told Agence France-Presse. “When Tai­wan was un­der mar­tial law, books banned here had to be pub­lished in Hong Kong and smug­gled back to Tai­wan.”</p>
    <p>Mr Liu, who also leads Tai­wan’s In­de­pen­dent Pub­lish­ers Al­liance, noted, how­ever, that books about the Hong Kong protests have not made much head­way in the lo­cal mar­ket as big pub­lish­ing houses with global foot­prints are fear­ful of reper­cus­sions from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“Ma­jor houses will have more con­cerns be­cause they may be barred from mar­kets in Hong Kong and main­land China af­ter pub­lish­ing these books,” he said.</p>
    <p>REVERSAL OF EVENTS</p>
    <p>It ap­pears to me that his­tory is re­peat­ing it­self in a re­versed way. When Tai­wan was un­der mar­tial law, books banned here had to be pub­lished in Hong Kong and smug­gled back to Tai­wan.</p>
