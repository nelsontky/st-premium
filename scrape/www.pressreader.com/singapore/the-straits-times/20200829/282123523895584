    <p>The prin­ci­pal of a sec­ondary school molested seven teenage boys on sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions at his work­place in 2017, a district court heard yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The boys, who were be­tween 13 and 15 years old at the time, were at-risk youths who had fam­ily prob­lems. They also had dis­ci­plinary records both in school and out­side.</p>
    <p>The school’s op­er­a­tions man­ager of­ten called them to the gen­eral of­fice to ei­ther serve their de­ten­tion or to coun­sel and in­form them of the dis­ci­plinary ac­tion they faced.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Mark Yeo said: “Upon notic­ing a stu­dent... the ac­cused would call him into his room to speak to the stu­dent.</p>
    <p>“At times, the ac­cused would also in­form the stu­dents’ teach­ers of his in­ten­tion to speak with them and fix a suit­able time for them to meet him at his of­fice on the pre­text of dis­cussing their dis­ci­plinary is­sues.”</p>
    <p>The man would then mo­lest the boys in his of­fice. In an ear­lier state­ment, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) had said the man was no longer em­ployed by the min­istry as of Jan 1, 2018.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to three counts of mo­lesta­tion in­volv­ing three boys.</p>
    <p>Eight other charges for sim­i­lar of­fences, in­clud­ing those linked to the other four boys, will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Both the man and the school can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect the boys’ iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Some time be­fore Aug 20, 2017, the op­er­a­tions man­ager was talk­ing to one of the vic­tims, then 13 years old, about his dis­ci­plinary is­sues when the ac­cused in­ter­vened and said that he would take over the mat­ter. He molested the boy af­ter they en­tered his of­fice. The pros­e­cu­tor said: “(The boy) did not dis­close the in­ci­dent to any­one in its immediate af­ter­math. Given his dis­ci­plinary is­sues, he felt that no one would be­lieve him if he were to dis­close what the ac­cused had done to him.”</p>
    <p>By us­ing a sim­i­lar ruse, the man molested a 14-year-old boy in Septem­ber 2017 and a 13-year-old boy the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>In late Oc­to­ber that year, the man molested an­other 14-year-old boy who told an­other vic­tim, a 15-year-old stu­dent, about his or­deal.</p>
    <p>On Oct 25, 2017, the two teenagers told the op­er­a­tions man­ager about what had hap­pened and the mat­ter was re­ported to MOE.</p>
    <p>An MOE of­fi­cer alerted the po­lice on Nov 6 that year, the court heard.</p>
    <p>The for­mer prin­ci­pal is now out on bail of $15,000 and he will be sen­tenced on Oct 6.</p>
