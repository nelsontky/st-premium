    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s an­nounce­ment last week that he was step­ping down from of­fice has trig­gered not just a suc­ces­sion race but also left ques­tions about the fu­ture direc­tion of Ja­pan’s for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty is un­der­stand­able, given that Mr Abe is leav­ing on a high note on the in­ter­na­tional front even if he is un­der a cloud at home over his govern­ment’s poor re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus cri­sis and crony cor­rup­tion scan­dals. No­tably, he is lauded in Asia for hav­ing played a cen­tral role in sal­vaging a mul­ti­lat­eral free trade agree­ment af­ter it was ditched by Washington.</p>
    <p>One big ques­tion in the air is: Will Mr Abe’s res­ig­na­tion see Ja­pan lose in­ter­est in the mul­ti­lat­eral frame­works in for­eign pol­icy that he worked so hard on in nearly eight years in of­fice?</p>
    <p>The an­swer is no.</p>
    <p>Who­ever suc­ceeds Mr Abe will need to but­tress and ex­tend th­ese net­works sim­ply be­cause Ja­pan’s se­cu­rity and pros­per­ity de­pend on them, even more so in the present tu­mul­tuous in­ter­na­tional en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The heart of the mat­ter is that Ja­pan needs a sta­ble and con­struc­tive tri­an­gle re­la­tion­ship with the United States and China, and mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism is a way to achieve it for Ja­pan, the small­est among the three.</p>
    <p>LDP FAC­TIONAL POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the mech­a­nism and dy­nam­ics of se­lect­ing the next prime min­is­ter also dic­tate that Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sor will have to fol­low the party’s direc­tion, and that means keep­ing to the path of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>To un­der­stand why that is the case, a quick dive is needed into the na­ture of fac­tional pol­i­tics in the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP).</p>
    <p>Un­der tra­di­tional party rules, 394 LDP Diet mem­bers and LDP branches in 47 pre­fec­tures (with three votes each) will vote to choose its leader around Sept 15. Who­ever wins gets to suc­ceed Mr Abe as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 535 votes are at stake and, given the num­bers, clearly the LDP Diet mem­bers hold the key to the out­come. But in Ja­pan’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem, do not ex­pect the can­di­dates to go scram­bling af­ter the 394 party mem­bers in­di­vid­u­ally for sup­port. Each of the party mem­bers does not get to de­cide on his own ac­cord who to vote for. Rather, he will vote ac­cord­ing to the de­ci­sion of his fac­tion leader.</p>
    <p>There are seven ma­jor fac­tions in the LDP, and essen­tially the next prime min­is­ter is cho­sen af­ter much horse-trad­ing among the fac­tions.</p>
    <p>To il­lus­trate how it works, con­sider the ex­am­ple of Mr Abe. He be­longs to the big­gest fac­tion in the LDP, the Seiwa-Kai, which has 97 Diet mem­bers cur­rently. Its heft helped keep him in power and its be­ing pro-US and fo­cused on se­cu­rity is­sues en­abled him to pass a con­tro­ver­sial Na­tional Se­cu­rity Bill.</p>
    <p>At present, no LDP pres­i­den­tial can­di­date has strong enough sup­port to be elected. Seiwa-Kai has yet to come out with the name of its pre­ferred can­di­date.</p>
    <p>For­mer de­fence min­is­ter Shigeru Ishiba, who gets most sup­port in pub­lic opin­ion sur­veys, has only 19 mem­bers in his fac­tion and has not se­cured any en­dorse­ment from the big­ger ones.</p>
    <p>For­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida, who is said to be Mr Abe’s pre­ferred suc­ces­sor, leads a fac­tion with 47 mem­bers. But he runs into stiff op­po­si­tion from pow­er­ful fac­tion lead­ers such as Toshi­hiro Nikai, who wants some­one with a stronger pres­ence.</p>
    <p>As for De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono, he seems to have failed to get the en­dorse­ment of his own fac­tion leader of 56 mem­bers, cur­rent Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Taro Aso.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to vet­eran jour­nal­ist Akira Sato, Mr Nikai, the LDP sec­re­tary-gen­eral and a fac­tion leader of 47 mem­bers, wants Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga to be the next party pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The up­shot is that with the cur­rent slate of con­tenders, much bar­gain­ing will be needed among the fac­tion lead­ers.</p>
    <p>It helps that all are agreed on the LDP’s car­di­nal prin­ci­ple – stay in power. Given the Covid-19 cri­sis and the sud­den res­ig­na­tion of the prime min­is­ter, it is likely that the party will pri­ori­tise sta­bil­ity in the LDP and na­tional pol­i­tics by em­pha­sis­ing the con­tin­u­a­tion of Mr Abe’s for­eign poli­cies.</p>
    <p>SINO-US BAL­ANC­ING ACT</p>
    <p>By get­ting into of­fice as a re­sult of so much in­ter­nal com­pro­mise, any­one who be­comes the next prime min­is­ter would be ex­pected to heed the LDP’s direc­tion in mak­ing poli­cies. What then is the LDP’s for­eign pol­icy prin­ci­ple?</p>
    <p>It is ba­si­cally to rely on the US for na­tional se­cu­rity and hav­ing good re­la­tions with China for Ja­pan’s eco­nomic pros­per­ity, as Mr Abe has been do­ing.</p>
    <p>The in­ten­si­fy­ing US-China power strug­gle may be caus­ing up­heavals near and far but for Ja­pan, the im­por­tance of keep­ing that tri­an­gu­lar re­la­tion­ship in­tact re­mains un­shaken. As United</p>
    <p>States na­tional se­cu­rity coun­cil for­mer Asia di­rec­tor Michael Green told the US Congress last year: “Ja­pan can­not af­ford to de­cou­ple from China.”</p>
    <p>There is more to Ja­pan’s in­ter­ac­tions with the US and China: be­ing the least pow­er­ful of the three, Ja­pan needs to em­brace other coun­tries in tilt­ing the power equa­tion in its favour. By lead­ing mul­ti­lat­eral frame­works, Ja­pan would also find it eas­ier to per­suade China and the US of the value of keep­ing Ja­pan on their sides, as that will give it a boost in the con­test against the other in the tri­an­gu­lar power bal­ance.</p>
    <p>So, in­stead of fac­ing China alone, Ja­pan forms groups to pres­sure China while mak­ing them at­trac­tive enough to have China want to be­come a mem­ber; the hope is that mem­ber­ship will also make China more open to com­pro­mise and ne­go­ti­a­tion.</p>
    <p>A good ex­am­ple is the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTTP), Mr Abe’s star achieve­ment. It is work­ing. Bei­jing is show­ing in­ter­est in par­tic­i­pat­ing in the CPTTP. If it hap­pens, the US might be in­cen­tivised to join it, if only to keep China from gain­ing too much in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>An­other ex­am­ple is the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) that in­cludes Ja­pan, China, South Korea, Aus­tralia, New Zealand and the 10 Asean mem­ber states. Ini­tially, China ob­jected to hav­ing Aus­tralia and New Zealand on board. But Ja­pan per­sisted to have the two coun­tries in­cluded in or­der to ef­fec­tively re­duce the in­flu­ence of China in de­ci­sion-mak­ing and to mod­er­ate its at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>Per­haps real­is­ing the in­creas­ing and un­matched power of China, the LDP is step­ping up its mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism drive.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, it es­tab­lished the Task­force for Strate­gic Cre­ation of a New In­ter­na­tional Or­der in June, with an eye to Ja­pan to play­ing a big­ger role in mak­ing rules in the global ef­fort to tackle critical is­sues such as cy­bertheft of na­tional se­cu­rity-re­lated in­for­ma­tion and tech­nol­ogy and in­dus­trial spy­ing in academia.</p>
    <p>The head of the task­force, Mr Akira Amari, is also keen on in­creas­ing the num­ber of Ja­panese at the head of in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions. Al­lud­ing obliquely to China’s grow­ing in­flu­ence in such bod­ies, he said: “Ja­pan should re­mem­ber that a coun­try has used in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions for its ben­e­fit.”</p>
    <p>For Ja­pan, the use of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism as a for­eign pol­icy in­stru­ment is not re­stricted to its deal­ings with China. As Na­tional De­fence Academy for­mer pres­i­dent Makoto Iok­ibe said of the hard lessons learnt from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s trans­ac­tional ap­proach to­wards Ja­pan on mat­ters such as tar­iffs and over­seas bases: “Trump has re­minded us that no al­liance is eter­nal, while we had seen our al­liance with the US as such”.</p>
    <p>True, it is likely that if Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den be­comes pres­i­dent, he would re-em­pha­sise the im­por­tance of the US’ al­liances. What­ever the out­come of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, Ja­pan is aware that on purely risk man­age­ment grounds alone, it pays to ex­tend glob­ally its net­work of shared stake­hold­ers in var­i­ous fields.</p>
    <p>What this means is that no mat­ter who suc­ceeds Mr Abe, the next prime min­is­ter can be ex­pected to fol­low in his foot­steps by ex­tend­ing and con­sol­i­dat­ing in­ter­na­tional frame­works to safe­guard Ja­pan’s own in­ter­ests.</p>
