    <p>“All’s well that ends well”, fa­mously wrote Wil­liam Shake­speare. But nov­el­ist Deb­o­rah Mog­gach’s turn on the no­tion, ren­dered fa­mous by the 2011 film The Best Ex­otic Marigold Ho­tel – “Ev­ery­thing will be all right in the end; if it is not all right, it is not the end” – bet­ter cap­tures the mean­ing of US pol­i­tics dur­ing the month since the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Now that the Elec­toral Col­lege has set its seal on Demo­crat Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory and we are fi­nally past any rea­son­able prospect that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his Repub­li­can Party can steal the elec­tion through Big Lies and le­gal chi­canery, we can sum­marise what has hap­pened and what it means.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and the bulk of the GOP en­gaged in an un­prece­dented post-elec­tion as­sault on Amer­i­can demo­cratic le­git­i­macy, and did so with stun­ning open­ness and shame­less­ness. Con­tentious elec­tions are not un­prece­dented in US his­tory – 1800, 1840, 1876 and 2000 were all marked by con­tro­versy – but the ev­i­dence-free and un­hinged na­ture of ar­gu­ments put for­ward by Trump lawyers Rudy Gi­u­liani and Sid­ney Pow­ell for a stolen elec­tion (dead Venezue­lan dic­ta­tor Hugo Chavez had a hand in it) and, above all, the fact that so many Amer­i­can adults have cared less about, if not ap­plauded, these and lesser an­tics, is cause for won­der­ment and worry.</p>
    <p>What the Repub­li­cans have done threat­ens to cre­ate a new nor­mal. At some point in the fu­ture, mag­i­cal-think­ing il­lib­eral “woke” Democrats may refuse to con­cede a lost elec­tion, claim mas­sive fraud with­out a shred of ev­i­dence, try to over­turn the re­sults and, fail­ing that, seek to re­sist the trans­fer of power, dele­git­imise the win­ner, and try dur­ing the tran­si­tion to sab­o­tage the vic­tor’s abil­ity to gov­ern.</p>
    <p>This sort of thing is not sup­posed to hap­pen in a healthy, well-in­sti­tu­tion­alised lib­eral democ­racy, where the op­po­si­tion is un­der­stood to be “loyal” within an ac­cepted con­sti­tu­tional le­gal frame­work that con­sti­tutes neu­tral ground for com­pe­ti­tion. But hav­ing hap­pened makes it eas­ier for it to hap­pen again.</p>
    <p>What has hap­pened sig­nals in­sti­tu­tional re­gres­sion, to be sure, but, just as im­por­tant, it sig­nals ero­sion of the foun­da­tional civic at­ti­tudes that need to cor­re­spond with in­sti­tu­tions in or­der for them to work.</p>
    <p>THREE UNDERCURRE­NTS</p>
    <p>Why is this hap­pen­ing? My hunch is that in­ter­flow­ing cul­tural undercurre­nts are the true source. Three are key: the creep­ing deca­dence that comes of too much sud­den, un­earned and so un­ap­pre­ci­ated wealth; the bur­geon­ing “gated” men­tal­ity of a morally hol­low post-war mer­i­to­cratic elite, and its aban­don­ment of civic pride and ed­u­ca­tion; and the tech­nol­ogy-pro­pelled ero­sion of deep lit­er­acy, in­creas­ingly re­placed by a re­al­ity-dis­plac­ing, fan­tasy spec­ta­cle world dis­played on mes­meris­ing and, more re­cently, neu­ro­phys­i­o­log­i­cally ad­dic­tive screens.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether, these grad­ual but pow­er­ful changes in the cul­ture un­der­cut ev­ery core as­pect of the clas­si­cal lib­eral tem­per­a­ment: hu­mil­ity, tol­er­ance, calm and rea­soned open de­bate re­spect­ful of facts, and prospects of gen­uine for­give­ness as against mere for­bear­ance.</p>
    <p>The sum of it all is to oc­clude the essence of the En­light­en­ment-based world­view – that of the pos­si­bil­ity and re­fine­ment of pos­i­tive-sum re­la­tion­ships em­bed­ded in an in­sti­tu­tional or­der – with an older, baser zero-sum men­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>The oc­clu­sion has gained ac­cel­er­a­tion in re­cent years from at least a half dozen sources.</p>
    <p>First, dur­ing un­usual in­flec­tions of so­cial anx­i­ety – and here the pan­demic is the coup de grace – re­li­gious modes of think­ing take pride of place for many.</p>
    <p>And in the United States, an un­usu­ally re­li­gious coun­try even when re­li­gious think­ing looks to be sec­u­lar, as it is these days on the left, a good deal of that think­ing tends to be highly ab­stract, Manichean, and two-val­ued in na­ture – zero-sum, in other words. When aroused, and even when not so aroused, Amer­i­cans ex­cel at ei­ther/or, my-way-or-the-high­way think­ing.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the ex­pe­ri­ence of Amer­ica’s ma­jor­ity non-elite with mostly made-in-the-USA fi­nan­cialised cy­ber cap­i­tal­ism, with the “gig economy” as its re­cent ex­tru­sion, more re­sem­bles a dog-eat-dog, zero-sum world than it does the age of the post-war “iron triangle”, where big busi­ness, big labour and gov­ern­ment man­aged to­gether to keep growth brisk, well spread, and hence the so­cial or­der po­lit­i­cally con­sen­sual.</p>
    <p>Third, mass-mar­ket en­ter­tain­ment over­whelm­ingly fea­tures sim­plis­tic and lately “dark” plots, and these are in­vari­ably zero-sum hero-vil­lain in nar­ra­tive struc­ture.</p>
    <p>The shadow ef­fect over time is un­mis­tak­able: Ever fewer Amer­i­cans can imag­ine ex­pla­na­tions for com­plex real-world po­lit­i­cal events that are more nu­anced than those typ­i­cal of Hol­ly­wood movies (think the mul­ti­ple Res­i­dent Evil, Fri­day The 13th se­ries, or per­haps most telling, The Hunger Games) or id­ioc­racy-ap­peal­ing tele­vi­sion shows (Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans).</p>
    <p>The de­fault con­se­quence is the ris­ing pop­u­lar­ity of con­spir­acy the­o­ries, es­pe­cially those fea­tur­ing some sin­is­ter “deep state” be­trayal of all that is good and holy. That Mr Trump’s “deep state” fan­tasies have res­onated with so many is no co­in­ci­dence.</p>
    <p>Fourth, sec­ondary schools in the US have vir­tu­ally stopped teach­ing civics as a form of pos­i­tive so­cial­i­sa­tion. Amer­ica’s civic na­tion­al­ism is more ab­stract and hence frag­ile than are the more nu­mer­ous blood­line va­ri­eties.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing of Amer­ica’s En­light­en­ment-based in­sti­tu­tions does not come nat­u­rally as does oral com­pre­hen­sion and speech to chil­dren; it must be taught, as with read­ing and writ­ing. If it is not, into the vac­uum will pour older, less re­fined forms of think­ing about so­cial and po­lit­i­cal life.</p>
    <p>Fifth, at least since 9/11, there has been a creep­ing mil­i­tari­sa­tion of Amer­i­can pop­u­lar cul­ture. War story nar­ra­tive arcs are more preva­lent than they were even dur­ing the early Cold War days, within liv­ing mem­ory for most Amer­i­cans of the World War II and Korean War era, when Cow­boy-In­dian “west­erns” were the meme of mass en­ter­tain­ment choice.</p>
    <p>We have cer­tainly wit­nessed a mas­sive mil­i­tari­sa­tion of polic­ing as an out­flow of the “war against ter­ror”, which is a big part of the po­lice abuse prob­lem that many think mis­tak­enly is ex­clu­sively about racism. Ob­vi­ously, mil­i­tary metaphors are by na­ture zero-sum: Fight­ing and dy­ing do not lend them­selves to co­op­er­a­tive images among those bear­ing dif­fer­ent in­ter­ests and pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Sixth, de­clin­ing so­cial trust in the US, a phe­nom­e­non decades in the mak­ing with many sources, en­cour­ages us-against-them zero-sum men­tal­i­ties, and the grow­ing affin­ity with iden­tity pol­i­tics, es­pe­cially on the left, in­creas­ingly in­clines many to think of an­tag­o­nists not as in­di­vid­u­als but as groups.</p>
    <p>Heaped on top of that is the very high pro­file of im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy po­lar­i­sa­tion. Many Democrats be­lieve that Repub­li­cans typ­i­cally op­pose even le­gal im­mi­gra­tion so as to pre­serve “white” dom­i­na­tion of the na­tion’s wealth and sta­tus struc­tures, while prob­a­bly most Repub­li­cans be­lieve that the Democrats have been try­ing to use im­mi­gra­tion to ren­der the GOP elec­torally ex­tinct by chang­ing the na­tion’s de­mog­ra­phy into a “ma­jor­ity of mi­nori­ties” sta­tus. One could hardly imag­ine a more pow­er­ful, seem­ingly ex­is­ten­tial dis­pute for mag­ni­fy­ing zero-sum premises.</p>
    <p>FIND­ING NEU­TRAL SPACE</p>
    <p>Here we come to the core gen­eral point. If hu­man so­cial na­ture has both com­pet­i­tive and co­op­er­a­tive as­pects, then com­pro­mise, con­cil­i­a­tion and ul­ti­mately so­cial learn­ing and progress are pos­si­ble. Pos­i­tive-sum re­la­tion­ships and in­sti­tu­tions erected to sup­port them are thus also pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>But if only the com­pet­i­tive and hence con­flict­ual ex­ist in the hu­man heart, it fol­lows that, by def­i­ni­tion, gen­eral cir­cum­stances im­prove (for one side, any­way) only from con­fronta­tion, from hurt­ing one’s ad­ver­saries and forc­ing them to con­cede. No agreed neu­tral space, even that rep­re­sented by law and its associated norms, can ex­ist. Ev­ery­thing is po­ten­tially weapon­is­able, with the re­sult that for any given en­gage­ment, there can only be win­ners and losers: zero-sum.</p>
    <p>Once this is un­der­stood, much of what has hap­pened lately in US pol­i­tics im­me­di­ately emerges into the fore­ground from the murk of the strange and berserk.</p>
    <p>For the Repub­li­can Party as cur­rently con­sti­tuted, norms con­cern­ing elec­tion con­duct, con­ces­sion ges­tures, tran­si­tion pro­to­cols and so on have lit­tle or no mean­ing. There is no law, only law­fare. And in the post-mod­ernist dis­pen­sa­tion, of the “fur­ther” left as well as now the right, where it is be­lieved that no ob­jec­tiv­ity, rea­son or foun­da­tional truths ex­ist, ev­ery­thing hov­ers in par­ti­san rel­a­tiv­ity, and so shame, which re­quires a ca­pac­ity for recog­nis­ing the be­trayal of a prin­ci­ple, be­comes passe. Only win­ning mat­ters, be­cause los­ing is imag­ined as tan­ta­mount to po­lit­i­cal death; both post-En­light­en­ment shards of Amer­ica’s two ma­jor par­ties have men­tally se­ceded from the union of lib­eral demo­cratic bonds.</p>
    <p>How else to ex­plain the far­ci­cal Se­nate Repub­li­can im­peach­ment trial, in which Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell openly pro­claimed that par­ti­san in­ter­ests took prece­dence over his oath of of­fice? (And the peo­ple of Ken­tucky re-elected him any­way.)</p>
    <p>How else to ex­plain out­go­ing At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr’s ar­gu­ments on be­half of a “uni­tary ex­ec­u­tive”, a Hobbe­sian zero-sum “nasty, brutish and short” neo-au­to­cratic no­tion, not a pos­i­tive-sum “so­cial con­tract” Lock­ean one?</p>
    <p>How else to ex­plain the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s move to end-run le­gal pro­tec­tion for civil ser­vants and to politi­cise ev­ery nook and cranny of the ex­ec­u­tive branch, in­clud­ing even the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion and the in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity? No won­der Mr Trump ad­mires Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, the avid builder of the “uni­tary state”.</p>
    <p>The bat­tle be­tween the pos­i­tive-sum val­ues of Amer­ica’s En­light­en­ment-born ex­per­i­ment and the zero-sum, Lord-Of-The-Flies chal­lengers is on­go­ing in both ma­jor US po­lit­i­cal par­ties. It will not con­clude soon as the de­ci­sions party lead­ers make im­pinge upon each other.</p>
    <p>The re­sul­tant dia­lec­tic will con­sti­tute the back­ground stereo ca­coph­ony of at least the next four years in Amer­i­can pol­i­tics – and yes, im­pli­ca­tions, ma­jor im­pli­ca­tions, abound for US for­eign pol­icy. Stay tuned for de­tails.</p>
