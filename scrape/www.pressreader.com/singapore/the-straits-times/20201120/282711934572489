    <p>One of my favourite restau­rants, the nine-year-old Lolla in Ann Siang Road, is one of those places that trans­port me to Barcelona or Lon­don or New York.</p>
    <p>None of these things would mat­ter if the food is not good. And Lolla’s food, shar­ing plates big and small, is al­ways on the money.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant has a new chef – Jo­hanne Siy, 39, orig­i­nally from the Philip­pines, but who has made Sin­ga­pore home for years. The busi­ness man­age­ment and ac­coun­tancy grad­u­ate worked for eight years at Proc­ter & Gam­ble here be­fore switch­ing ca­reers.</p>
    <p>She trained at the Culi­nary In­sti­tute of Amer­ica in New York, and then worked at Le Bernardin and Cafe Boulud be­fore re­turn­ing to</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore. Here, she worked four years at the now-de­funct Restau­rant An­dre, and has also done stints at Faviken in Swe­den, and Re­lae and Noma in Copen­hagen.</p>
    <p>Her food matches the vibe of Lolla. Oys­ter, Oys­ter, Oys­ter! ($22) is a cheeky dish of grilled oys­ters, with pa­per-thin slices of king oys­ter mush­room draped over them. Each shell is then topped with an oys­ter leaf, which tastes like the shell­fish. At the bot­tom of the shell is beurre blanc, its rich­ness and acid­ity a per­fect com­ple­ment.</p>
    <p>Tiny, ten­der Bou­chot mus­sels ($38) are the stars of an­other dish. They sit on cele­riac puree and this surf and turf dish is aro­matic with dill oil, my favourite herb. Af­ter you have pol­ished it off, chef Siy comes round with shot glasses of sweet mus­sel broth, the liq­uid from cook­ing the bi­valves. I love how noth­ing goes to waste.</p>
    <p>That’s the case with Spot Prawn Crudo, Sea Urchin, Osci­etra Caviar ($68) too. Sweet amaebi, uni and caviar get zing from yuzu juice and the crunch comes not just from pop­ping the fish eggs, but also from wisps of ice plant on top. Af­ter I am done, I get the prawn heads, deep fried. Hap­pi­ness.</p>
    <p>But re­ally, the two beef dishes I have are what will keep my love af­fair with Lolla alive for a long time.</p>
    <p>Mayura Wagyu Tartare ($38) is an­other land and sea dish. The hand-chopped meat, topped with pars­ley and freshly grated horse­rad­ish, is served with an in­tense oys­ter aioli. The shell­fish takes the place of eggs in the emul­sion. And if that is not enough, the dish is served with crackly Jerusalem ar­ti­choke chips, their earthy flavour so on point with the tartare and the aioli.</p>
    <p>The main at my din­ner is more of that beef. Mayura Wagyu Tri-Tip ($88) is cooked sous vide for 15 hours and then sub­jected to nu­clear heat. When I bite into a piece, I hear crack­ling from the fierce sear and the veins of fat.</p>
    <p>No, it is not too rich. I ate two slices.</p>
    <p>Ca­cao nibs are strewn over the slices of beef, a nod to the cho­co­late the cat­tle are fed as part of their diet. I love the charred Swiss chard and wish it came in a big­ger pile. Mayura cat­tle are also fed the veg­etable.</p>
    <p>Who knew cow food could be so com­pelling? In chef Siy’s ca­pa­ble hands, they are.</p>
