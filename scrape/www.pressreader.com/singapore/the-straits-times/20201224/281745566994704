    <p>• South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in yes­ter­day faced grow­ing pub­lic pres­sure over his Covid-19 vac­cine pro­cure­ment plans as the coun­try re­ported its sec­ond-high­est daily tally of cases.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia has lam­basted the gov­ern­ment’s ap­proach to se­cur­ing newly de­vel­oped vac­cines as too re­laxed and overly re­liant on lo­cally pro­duced shots, which will take more time than over­seas op­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a poll by re­search firm Real­me­ter, six in 10 South Kore­ans be­lieve ur­gency should be pri­ori­tised over safety when it comes to Covid-19 vac­cines and that in­oc­u­la­tions should start as soon as pos­si­ble, given the rapid surge in cases.</p>
    <p>South Korea had 1,092 new coro­n­avirus cases on Tues­day, bring­ing the na­tional tally to 52,550, with 739 deaths, the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency said. The record high of 1,097 cases was logged on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Late on Tues­day, Mr Moon’s of­fice said a pub­lic in­oc­u­la­tion pro­gramme would “not be­gin too late”. The gov­ern­ment pre­vi­ously said vac­ci­na­tions could start as early as next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Dr Son Young-rae, a se­nior of­fi­cial at the Health Min­istry, said that the United States and Bri­tain, suf­fer­ing much higher case num­bers and death rates, have no al­ter­na­tive to anti-virus mea­sures other than vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“These coun­tries are some­what in­ap­pro­pri­ate for us to take as teach­ers, and con­sid­er­ing the process of safety checks, we be­lieve there is no rea­son for us to be the world’s first or sec­ond coun­try to re­ceive the vac­cines,” he said.</p>
    <p>The first batch of vac­cines for US mil­i­tary per­son­nel sta­tioned in South Korea will ar­rive as early as to­day, a source said.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s ag­gres­sive trac­ing and test­ing early in the pan­demic made the coun­try a global suc­cess story, but the re­cent surge in cases has con­founded ef­forts to con­tain the virus.</p>
    <p>Seoul and its sur­round­ing ar­eas have banned gath­er­ings of more than four peo­ple with ef­fect from yes­ter­day un­til Jan 3, and both restau­rant own­ers and pa­trons could face fines of up to three mil­lion won (S$3,600) for vi­o­lat­ing the or­der.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have also shut down ski re­sorts and win­ter tourist spots in a bid to stop the spread dur­ing the Christ­mas and New Year hol­i­days.</p>
