    <p>KEEN TO MAKE A DIF­FER­ENCE</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis in the dor­mi­to­ries, I felt up­set and con­cerned about the spread of in­fec­tion and wor­ried that the peo­ple I knew may be af­fected. If my re­search can in­form and shift pol­icy to bet­ter these con­di­tions, that will be ful­fill­ing to me.</p>
    <p>MS POH YONG HAN, who has an in­ter­est in mi­grant worker is­sues and be­friended some work­ers here.</p>
    <p>Har­vard grad­u­ate Poh Yong Han is the first in her fam­ily to go to university, but her par­ents never pres­sured her to ex­cel in her stud­ies.</p>
    <p>The only child – whose fa­ther runs a ren­o­va­tion firm and mum is a house­wife – said her par­ents raised her with a strong work ethic and stressed the im­por­tance of hu­mil­ity to her at a young age.</p>
    <p>Her grand­fa­ther, a re­tired hawker, and grand­mother, a cleaner, also kept her grounded through her years at Raf­fles Girls’ School and Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Late last month, Ms Poh, 23, re­ceived news that she had been awarded the pres­ti­gious Rhodes Schol­ar­ship to pur­sue a PhD at Ox­ford University next year.</p>
    <p>The award of the Rhodes Schol­ar­ship re­sumed in Sin­ga­pore in 2018, after it was sus­pended here and in sev­eral other coun­tries in 2006 due to fund­ing is­sues.</p>
    <p>For­mer re­cip­i­ents of the schol­ar­ship, which was es­tab­lished in 1902, in­clude for­mer US pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton and for­mer Aus­tralian prime min­is­ter Bob Hawke.</p>
    <p>Ms Poh, who is now fin­ish­ing her mas­ter’s de­gree in South-east Asian stud­ies at the Na­tional University of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), will con­tinue to pur­sue her in­ter­est in is­sues af­fect­ing mi­grant work­ers and refugees at Ox­ford.</p>
    <p>Her in­ter­est in those who live on the mar­gins de­vel­oped after she be­gan her un­der­grad­u­ate stud­ies at Har­vard University in the United States.</p>
    <p>There, Ms Poh was struck by the chal­lenges faced by im­mi­grants, in ar­eas such as education and jobs.</p>
    <p>“On the one hand, there were in­ter­na­tional stu­dents like me who could fur­ther their education in a di­verse and safe space, and on the other, there were low-wage mi­grants on tem­po­rary visas and un­doc­u­mented mi­grants who strug­gled daily,” she said.</p>
    <p>De­ter­mined to make a dif­fer­ence, she taught Eng­lish as a sec­ond lan­guage to Chi­nese im­mi­grants in the Greater Bos­ton area, and was a peer-ad­vis­ing fel­low for first-year stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Although ini­tially ap­pre­hen­sive about study­ing over­seas due to fi­nan­cial con­straints, Ms Poh was able to se­cure gen­er­ous fi­nan­cial aid from Har­vard in 2016 to pur­sue her stud­ies at the Ivy League col­lege. Cam­pus life was an eye-opener. “On the one hand, you had ex­tremely wealthy (and mostly white) ‘legacy’ stu­dents and chil­dren of bil­lion­aires who at­tended the same elite prep schools; and on the other hand, you also had un­doc­u­mented stu­dents, work­ing-class stu­dents, and poorer stu­dents who hailed from de­vel­op­ing coun­tries and so forth,” she re­called.</p>
    <p>“I felt very lucky to have had the education I re­ceived in Sin­ga­pore, which pre­pared me well for the rigours of Har­vard.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, I also recog­nise that I was for­tu­nate to have at­tended schools that re­ceived a dis­pro­por­tion­ate amount of re­sources, and that our pub­lic education, while rel­a­tively af­ford­able, is also highly un­even.”</p>
    <p>In­ter­ested in the so­cial is­sues fac­ing Sin­ga­pore, she be­came ed­i­tor-in-chief of the Sin­ga­pore Pol­icy Jour­nal, a stu­dent-run jour­nal at the Har­vard Kennedy School, which fo­cuses on pub­lic pol­icy.</p>
    <p>For her se­nior th­e­sis, she wrote on mi­grant worker po­etry and sto­ry­telling com­mu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>After grad­u­at­ing in May this year, Ms Poh de­cided to look at mi­grant worker rights and so­cial is­sues from a Sin­ga­porean stand­point, and en­rolled at NUS.</p>
    <p>Pur­su­ing a PhD, she said, is a chance to dive deep into an is­sue she is pas­sion­ate about – pro­tect­ing mi­grant rights.</p>
    <p>“I want to break this perception of academia as an ivory tower and reach out to peo­ple on the ground who are im­pacted by the poli­cies and de­ci­sions taken at a re­gional or na­tional level,” she said.</p>
    <p>Of her in­ter­est in pur­su­ing mi­grant worker is­sues, she said: “When I came back to Sin­ga­pore dur­ing university breaks, I be­friended mi­grant work­ers here while do­ing my field work and got to know some of them per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis in the dor­mi­to­ries, I felt up­set and con­cerned about the spread of in­fec­tion and wor­ried that the peo­ple I knew may be af­fected. If my re­search can in­form and shift pol­icy to bet­ter these con­di­tions, that will be ful­fill­ing to me.”</p>
    <p>At Ox­ford, Ms Poh plans to study im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy af­fect­ing eco­nomic mi­grants and asy­lum-seek­ing refugees, as well as transna­tional mi­grant bro­ker­age, such as the trend of agents charg­ing mi­grant work­ers com­mis­sion for over­seas job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>On her fam­ily’s re­ac­tion to the happy news, Ms Poh said she had to ex­plain the sig­nif­i­cance of the schol­ar­ship and doc­toral stud­ies to her grand­par­ents, who did not know much about Ox­ford.</p>
    <p>“I find their per­spec­tive re­ally help­ful be­cause they re­mind me to see beyond pres­tige and be level-headed in my work.”</p>
