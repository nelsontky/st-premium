    <p>For the price of an econ­omy-class ticket to Paris, you can now en­joy a first-class stay­ca­tion at the Raf­fles Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pay for one night in its The Suite Life pack­age and the sec­ond is on the house, with a free suite up­grade, early check-in and late check-out, as well as $100 in cred­its to spend at its food out­lets, spa or bou­tique. Room rates start at $795++.</p>
    <p>If you are on a bud­get, co-liv­ing space lyf Funan Sin­ga­pore’s The Ul­ti­mate Lo­cal Va­ca­tion deal is hard to beat. You get a night’s ac­com­mo­da­tion in a One of a Kind stu­dio from $108++ and can check out at 6pm and en­joy dis­counts at shops in Funan mall down­stairs.</p>
    <p>Now that stay­ca­tions are al­lowed un­der phase two, ho­tels are en­tic­ing travel-hun­gry Sin­ga­pore­ans with the next best thing – a fun­filled es­cape from the con­fines of home, but with strin­gent safe man­age­ment prac­tices to pre­vent the com­mu­nity spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Such prac­tices in­clude re­duc­ing ca­pac­ity and in­ter­min­gling, rig­or­ous clean­ing and dis­in­fect­ing reg­i­mens and screen­ing guests be­fore en­try.</p>
    <p>Still, de­mand is ex­pected to be strong be­cause of the week-long school hol­i­day, which started yes­ter­day, as well as two up­com­ing long week­ends on July 31 for Hari Raya Haji and on Aug 9 for Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 47 ho­tels have re­ceived of­fi­cial ap­proval to of­fer room stays as of last Fri­day. They range from the three-star Ho­tel NuVe in Bugis to lux­ury brands such as The St Regis Sin­ga­pore, as well as more un­usual ones such as lyf and One°15 Ma­rina Sen­tosa Cove.</p>
    <p>Many ho­tels, in­clud­ing W Sin­ga­pore – Sen­tosa Cove, The Fuller­ton Ho­tels and Re­sorts and Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Mar­riott Tang Plaza Ho­tel – are al­ready re­port­ing healthy book­ings and nu­mer­ous in­quiries.</p>
    <p>Far East Hos­pi­tal­ity, which runs 23 ho­tels and ser­viced apart­ments lo­cally, has been re­ceiv­ing more than 80 in­quiries daily via calls, so­cial me­dia and its web­sites. Its chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, Mr Arthur Kiong, says book­ings are espe­cially pop­u­lar with cou­ples and fam­i­lies cel­e­brat­ing an­niver­saries and birth­days.</p>
    <p>The pent-up de­mand does not sur­prise As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Detlev Remy at the fac­ulty for the hos­pi­tal­ity busi­ness de­gree pro­gramme at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy. He fore­casts high de­mand as “most peo­ple want to en­joy a dif­fer­ent set­ting or en­vi­ron­ment” af­ter be­ing cooped up at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In fact, anal­y­sis of global sen­ti­ment sur­veys shows that peo­ple all over the world are now opt­ing for short-stay hol­i­days, he adds.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects the stay­ca­tion scene to evolve, with more Sin­ga­pore­ans book­ing longer stay­ca­tions and ho­tels bundling at­trac­tion and food of­fers with ac­com­mo­da­tion to cre­ate “real hol­i­day ex­pe­ri­ences” that guests will come back for.</p>
    <p>Far East Hos­pi­tal­ity’s Mr Kiong adds that while ho­tel staff are as ex­cited as their guests at the re­open­ing, there is also the re­spon­si­bil­ity of en­forc­ing pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures while en­sur­ing cus­tomers en­joy a “qual­ity stay”.</p>
    <p>“Bal­anc­ing these will be the chal­lenge for all hote­liers and guests.”</p>
