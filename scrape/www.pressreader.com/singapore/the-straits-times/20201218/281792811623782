    <p>HANOI • Viet­nam yes­ter­day be­gan hu­man tri­als of its Covid-19 vac­cine, with three vol­un­teers re­ceiv­ing their first doses of Nanoco­vax at the Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Univer­sity in the cap­i­tal Hanoi.</p>
    <p>The two men and a woman, whose iden­ti­ties have been kept pri­vate, will be mon­i­tored for 72 hours at the academy be­fore be­ing al­lowed to re­turn to their homes. They will be mon­i­tored for 56 days af­ter the vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The three were cho­sen from about 300 who vol­un­teered for the hu­man tri­als of the vac­cine, de­vel­oped by Nanogen Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Biotech­nol­ogy JSC which is based in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
    <p>Lieu­tenant-Gen­eral Do Quyet, di­rec­tor of the med­i­cal univer­sity, said: “It’s time Viet­nam can pro­claim to the world that we can do this, just like the ev­i­dent suc­cesses we have had in pre­vent­ing and con­trol­ling Covid-19 in the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has recorded very low coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates, with only 1,405 cases and 35 deaths re­ported so far.</p>
    <p>Its gov­ern­ment is com­mit­ted to pro­duc­ing a home­grown coro­n­avirus vac­cine to avoid re­liance on other vac­cines whose sup­ply might not be suf­fi­cient to meet world­wide de­mand.</p>
    <p>“The stock of ap­proved vac­cines can only reach one-fifth of the global pop­u­la­tion and most of it will go to de­vel­oped coun­tries,” said Dr Quyet at a press brief­ing af­ter the vac­cine was ad­min­is­tered to the three vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>The first phase trial for Nanoco­vax is ex­pected to last four months. This will be fol­lowed by an­other four-month trial for the sec­ond phase which will in­volve 400 to 600 test sub­jects, and six months for the third and fi­nal phase which might in­volve as many as 10,000 peo­ple in Viet­nam, Bangladesh, In­dia and In­done­sia, ac­cord­ing to the Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Nanogen’s di­rec­tor of re­search and de­vel­op­ment Do Minh Tri said the com­pany has worked out a spe­cial health in­sur­ance plan to cover the health risks taken by the vac­cine vol­un­teers, with the pay­ment set at 100 mil­lion dong (S$5,700) per in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The clin­i­cal trial re­sults will not be avail­able un­til the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Nanoco­vax is the first Viet­nam­made Covid-19 vac­cine to en­ter hu­man tri­als, with an­other two from other man­u­fac­tur­ers to fol­low in Fe­bru­ary and March. Nanogen said it could pro­duce five mil­lion doses per month.</p>
    <p>Nanoco­vax can be stored in nor­mal cold stor­age at 2-8 deg C.</p>
    <p>With state sub­si­dies, the price of each in­jec­tion is set at 120,000 dong and each per­son will need two shots, with an in­ter­val of 28 days be­tween the shots.</p>
