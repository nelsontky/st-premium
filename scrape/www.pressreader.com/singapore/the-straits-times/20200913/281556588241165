    <p>Pan­demic or not, buy­ers are still pay­ing top dol­lar for sky­scraper HDB re­sale flats, par­tic­u­larly those at Pinnacle@Dux­ton and other prime ar­eas.</p>
    <p>New price records were hit even as the num­ber of mil­lion-dol­lar HDB re­sale deals fell year-on-year in the first seven months as the pan­demic took its toll on the econ­omy and em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>De­fy­ing the odds, a five-room flat at Pinnacle@Dux­ton in Can­ton­ment Road fetched a record $1.232 mil­lion in March, while a four-room unit sold for $1.186 mil­lion in June. Both were on the 40th-42nd storeys, with a re­main­ing lease of al­most 90 years.</p>
    <p>“No doubt we are in a re­ces­sion but there are still buy­ers with sub­stan­tial sav­ings, or are more con­fi­dent about their job prospects. (Then there are those) who, due to the down­turn, may wish to down­grade from pri­vate prop­erty to th­ese prized re­sale flats,” said Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of re­search at PropNex.</p>
    <p>But th­ese mega deals are still the ex­cep­tion rather than the norm and ac­count for only a frac­tion of over­all HDB re­sale trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>In the first seven months of this year, the num­ber of re­sale flats that sold for at least $1 mil­lion fell to 33 in the first seven months this year – just 0.3 per cent of a to­tal of 11,217 HDB re­sale trans­ac­tions – com­pared with 44 in the same pe­riod last year, PropNex noted.</p>
    <p>This is in line with the slow­down in over­all HDB re­sale vol­umes fol­low­ing the two-month-long cir­cuit breaker and the weak eco­nomic out­look.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, there were 64 such deals last year, 71 in 2018 and 46 in 2017. The years 2018 and 2019 were stand-out years with the high­est num­ber of $1 mil­lion deals due to col­lec­tive sale flat own­ers look­ing for re­place­ment homes who did not mind pay­ing above $1 mil­lion for HDB flats with great at­tributes, said an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Even now, they say re­sale flats in prime lo­ca­tions with panoramic views, or large units on high floors with longer re­main­ing leases, or units near MRT sta­tions within a 15-minute ride of the Cen­tral Business Dis­trict, can con­tinue to com­mand the mil­lion-dol­lar price tag.</p>
    <p>“If a 500 sq ft to 800 sq ft new condo unit at One Pearl Bank can cost an av­er­age price of around $1.6 mil­lion or $2,538 psf, it’s not sur­pris­ing that some buy­ers won’t mind pay­ing $1 mil­lion for larger and newer HDB re­sale flats in ar­eas near the CBD like Pinnacle@ Dux­ton and Boon Tiong Road,” said Ms Christine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie.</p>
    <p>Other than Pinnacle@Dux­ton, there has not been much new Build-To-Or­der stock in the cen­tral area – an­other fac­tor sup­port­ing prices, she added.</p>
    <p>Four-room flats be­gan hit­ting the mil­lion-dol­lar mark, start­ing in June 2018, with a 1,033 sq ft unit at Pinnacle@Dux­ton, which snagged $1.028 mil­lion. Eight more four­room flats were trans­acted at $1 mil­lion and above later that year.</p>
    <p>Last year, there were 10 such sales: nine in Can­ton­ment Road and one in Boon Tiong Road.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary to July this year, there were six such sales – four in Can­ton­ment Road and two in Boon Tiong Road. In­ter­est­ingly, not all were high-floor units. One unit on the 16th-18th storeys, with 95 years of re­main­ing lease, in Boon Tiong Road sold for $1.008 mil­lion in Jan­uary this year.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of four-room mil­lion-dol­lar flats sold as a pro­por­tion of the to­tal is inch­ing up, th­ese still ac­count for less than 20 per cent of the to­tal of 33 sold in the first seven months of this year.</p>
    <p>Of the 33, 21 units or 64 per cent were five-room flats, while six oth­ers were ex­ec­u­tive flats.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said it is un­com­mon for four-room re­sale flats to trans­act at over $1 mil­lion and those that do tend to have very unique at­tributes.</p>
    <p>Pinnacle@Dux­ton is the world’s tallest pub­lic hous­ing de­vel­op­ment and has the long­est sky gar­dens; while the Boon Tiong Road flats are near the CBD, have at least 95 years of lease left, a panoramic view of the down­town area and Tiong Bahru’s her­itage charm.</p>
    <p>ERA Re­alty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak noted that the lo­ca­tion of the mil­lion-dol­lar flats could shift as more HDB flats in prime ar­eas com­plete their five-year min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod and be­come el­i­gi­ble for re­sale.</p>
    <p>“But their lo­ca­tion must still be ac­ces­si­ble to the CBD and near a MRT sta­tion. Once the pro­posed flats are built at the Greater South­ern Wa­ter­front, th­ese will likely com­pete with those at Pinnacle@Dux­ton,” he said. Around 9,000 hous­ing units – both pub­lic and pri­vate – will be built on the site of Kep­pel Club as part of the fu­ture Greater South­ern Wa­ter­front on the south­ern coast­line of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
