    <p>WASHINGTON • Dr Joseph Varon, a doc­tor treat­ing coro­n­avirus pa­tients at a Texas hos­pi­tal, was work­ing his 252nd day in a row when he spot­ted a dis­traught el­derly man in the Covid-19 in­ten­sive care unit (ICU).</p>
    <p>His com­fort­ing em­brace of the white-haired man on Thanks­giv­ing Day last Thurs­day was cap­tured by a pho­tog­ra­pher for Getty Im­ages and has gone vi­ral around the world.</p>
    <p>Dr Varon, chief of staff at United Memo­rial Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Hous­ton, told CNN he was en­ter­ing the Covid-19 ICU when he saw the el­derly pa­tient “out of his bed and try­ing to get out of the room”.</p>
    <p>“And he’s cry­ing,” Dr Varon said. “So I get close to him and I (ask) him, ‘Why are you cry­ing?’, and the man says, ‘I want to be with my wife’, so I just grab him and I hold him.</p>
    <p>“I was feel­ing very sorry for him. I was feel­ing very sad, just like him.”</p>
    <p>“Even­tu­ally he felt bet­ter and he stopped cry­ing,” Dr Varon told CNN on Mon­day, which he said was his 256th con­sec­u­tive day of work.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know why I haven’t bro­ken down,” he added. “My nurses cry in the mid­dle of the day.”</p>
    <p>Dr Varon said the iso­la­tion of the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 unit was dif­fi­cult for many pa­tients, par­tic­u­larly the el­derly.</p>
    <p>“You can imag­ine,” he said.</p>
    <p>“You are in­side a room where peo­ple are com­ing in space­suits.</p>
    <p>“When you are an el­derly in­di­vid­ual, it’s more dif­fi­cult be­cause you are alone. Some of them cry. Some of them try to es­cape</p>
    <p>“We ac­tu­ally had some­body who tried to es­cape through a win­dow the other day.”</p>
    <p>Dr Varon said the el­derly man in the pic­ture is “do­ing much bet­ter”.</p>
    <p>“We are hop­ing that be­fore the end of the week, he’ll be able to get out of the hos­pi­tal,” he added.</p>
    <p>The doc­tor also had a mes­sage for peo­ple who are not tak­ing pre­cau­tions amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are out there in bars, restau­rants, malls,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is crazy. Peo­ple don’t lis­ten, and then they end up in my ICU. What peo­ple need to know is I don’t want to have to be hug­ging them.</p>
    <p>“They need to do the ba­sic things – keep their so­cial dis­tance, wear their masks, wash their hands and avoid go­ing to places where there are a lot of peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Dr Varon added: “If peo­ple would do that, health­care work­ers like me could hope­fully rest.”</p>
