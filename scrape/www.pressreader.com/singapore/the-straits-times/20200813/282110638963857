    <p>A for­mer Sats of­fi­cer was sen­tenced to 15 months’ jail for eight cor­rup­tion charges in­volv­ing a to­tal sum of more than $150,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lim Koon Chuan, 59, was a cargo tech­ni­cal su­per­vi­sor at Sats, the chief ground-han­dling and in­flight cater­ing ser­vice provider at Changi Air­port, when he took mul­ti­ple bribes in ex­change for help­ing com­pa­nies get awarded ten­der con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Four­teen other charges were also taken into con­sid­er­a­tion in Lim’s sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Lim worked at Sats from 1982 to 2017, and was re­spon­si­ble for re­pair works on tech­ni­cal sys­tems within the air­freight ter­mi­nals.</p>
    <p>These re­pair works were usu­ally car­ried out by ex­ter­nal con­trac­tors en­gaged by the com­pany. Lim’s job scope in­cluded en­sur­ing that the con­tracted work was car­ried out prop­erly. He was also given the task of ap­proach­ing and hir­ing con­trac­tors for ad hoc re­pair and main­te­nance jobs on air freight ter­mi­nals.</p>
    <p>But he took ad­van­tage of his po­si­tion to so­licit com­mis­sion pay­ments in or­der for con­tracts to be awarded.</p>
    <p>When ap­proached by one Tang Bok Song, a su­per­vi­sor at GT Con­trac­tor, re­gard­ing an up­com­ing open ten­der for a cus­to­dian con­tract, Lim told Tang that he would need a com­mis­sion worth 10 per cent of the con­tract price.</p>
    <p>Tang then told Teo Yoke Chi­ang, di­rec­tor of K&T Build­ing Con­struc­tion, about this po­ten­tial op­por­tu­nity. The men put in a bid for the con­tract through a nom­i­nee com­pany, KJS Con­struc­tion, which had the req­ui­site govern­ment li­cences to ful­fil the con­tract.</p>
    <p>Teo and Tang man­aged to raise a to­tal sum of $120,000, and handed the cash over to Lim on two oc­ca­sions in 2017 – on Jan 13 and 25.</p>
    <p>Lim then en­listed the help of</p>
    <p>Chen Baol­ing, a 37-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman who worked with him as an as­sis­tant man­ager for build­ing ser­vices with Sats, to en­sure the “smooth” han­dling of the con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Jan 13 and 25, 2017, Lim ar­ranged to meet Chen at a carpark and gave her $20,000 as a “to­ken of ap­pre­ci­a­tion”, which she ac­cepted.</p>
    <p>KJS Con­struc­tion was awarded the ten­der for the main­te­nance of Sats Air­freight Ter­mi­nal 1 to 6 from March 1, 2017 to Feb 28 this year.</p>
    <p>Along with Lim, Chen was charged with cor­rup­tion on Sept 25 last year when she was also ac­cused of ac­cept­ing $3,000 in bribes from a man­ager of a com­pany known as AT Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The court heard then that she in­tended to plead guilty to her of­fences and her case was ad­journed to Oct 8.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Lim was also taken to task for other charges in­volv­ing sev­eral thou­sands of dol­lars for cor­ruptly award­ing con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Some of these in­stances in­volved the award­ing of marked-up con­tracts to con­trac­tors, ob­tain­ing cash in ex­change for these con­tracts go­ing through, and ac­cept­ing gra­tu­ities for in­tro­duc­ing more jobs to con­trac­tors.</p>
