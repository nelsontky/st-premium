    <p>The Work­ers’ Party-run Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC) will not drop the law­suit against its own party mem­bers be­cause it owes fidu­ciary du­ties to the town coun­cil, a law lec­turer has sug­gested.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing a land­mark High Court rul­ing last year that town coun­cil­lors have fidu­ciary du­ties to town coun­cils, Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity lec­turer Ni­cholas Liu said the “only legally safe and prac­ti­cal way for­ward” would be for SKTC to ap­point an independen­t panel to di­rect the suit on its be­half.</p>
    <p>“This hold­ing was a first for Sin­ga­pore law,” said Mr Liu, re­fer­ring to the judg­ment by Jus­tice Kan­nan Ramesh in the suit brought by Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil (AHTC) against town coun­cil­lors from the Work­ers’ Party (WP), which is un­der ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The WP-run SKTC will take over man­age­ment of a par­al­lel law­suit ini­ti­ated by the Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC), af­ter the op­po­si­tion party won Sengkang GRC at the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu con­tended in an ar­ti­cle pub­lished last week on Sin­ga­pore LawBlog, a data­base of ar­ti­cles on Sin­ga­pore law, that the an­swer for SKTC is “not that sim­ple”. Con­tin­u­ing with the suit by di­rect­ing the pro­ceed­ings it­self would also lay SKTC open to con­flict of in­ter­est con­cerns, he wrote.</p>
    <p>“Thus, the only legally safe and prac­ti­cal way for­ward ap­pears to be for SKTC to ap­point an independen­t panel to di­rect the lit­i­ga­tion on its be­half, as was pre­vi­ously done by AHTC in con­sul­ta­tion with the Hous­ing and De­vel­op­ment Board,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The independen­t panel would then be in a po­si­tion to de­cide whether the suit should con­tinue and, as­sum­ing it does, to steer the pro­ceed­ings,” he added.</p>
    <p>SKTC was formed last week along with 16 other town coun­cils. Un­der the law, town coun­cils have up to 90 days from the date of the or­der – till Oct 28 – to take over the man­age­ment of trans­ferred ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The new Sengkang GRC con­sists of Pung­gol East SMC as well as parts of the for­mer Sengkang West SMC and Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC.</p>
    <p>PRPTC had filed the on­go­ing civil suit against WP chair­man Sylvia Lim, for­mer party chief Low Thia Khi­ang and six other de­fen­dants to re­cover al­leged losses in­curred by the for­mer Pung­gol East SMC when it was in WP hands be­tween the 2013 by-elec­tion and 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Liu: “If SKTC were to de­cide on its own to dis­con­tinue the suit, the Sengkang town coun­cil­lors would run a se­ri­ous risk of be­ing in breach of their own fidu­ciary du­ties to SKTC, ex­pos­ing them­selves to po­ten­tial pro­ceed­ings in fu­ture. Given that the WP has con­trolled AHTC since the 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion (although it en­trusted the con­duct of the lit­i­ga­tion to an independen­t panel), this awk­ward sit­u­a­tion of ‘own­self sue own­self’ is a some­what fa­mil­iar one.”</p>
    <p>WP MP He Ting Ru, who is the chair­man of SKTC, had said in a Face­book post last month that the in­com­ing coun­cil­lors would en­sure all de­ci­sions taken on the on­go­ing law­suit are “fair, trans­par­ent and in ac­cor­dance with the law” and that they “re­main guided by (their) over­rid­ing duty to al­ways act in the best in­ter­ests of the res­i­dents of Sengkang GRC”.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu said that un­til the Court of Ap­peal rules on the case and pro­vides clar­ity, town coun­cil­lors must, out of prac­ti­cal­ity, act on the as­sump­tion that they owe fidu­ciary du­ties to their town coun­cil. To do oth­er­wise would be a dan­ger­ous gam­ble, he added.</p>
    <p>The safe bet is that SKTC will ap­point an independen­t panel to con­duct the re­main­der of the suit, con­sis­tent with the WP’s re­cent state­ment and the prece­dent it set in re­spect of AHTC, he said.</p>
    <p>The new Sengkang town coun­cil­lors, hav­ing not been in­volved in pre­vi­ous de­ci­sions in­volv­ing Pung­gol East, would be safe from any po­ten­tial claims against them for breach of fidu­ciary du­ties, as­sum­ing the ap­point­ment process of the independen­t panel it­self was be­yond re­proach, Mr Liu added.</p>
    <p>“Re­gard­less of whether the above pre­dic­tion comes to pass, re­cent de­vel­op­ments and, in­deed, the un­der­ly­ing Pung­gol East dis­pute make one thing clear: Pri­vate law can have a very real im­pact on the pub­lic sphere. Politi­cians, no less than com­mer­cial di­rec­tors, would do well to pay heed to their pri­vate obli­ga­tions if they wish to avoid pub­lic dis­as­ter.”</p>
