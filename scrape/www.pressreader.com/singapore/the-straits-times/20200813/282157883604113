    <p>A 64-year-old woman con­tin­ued to use her bank ac­counts to re­ceive funds from peo­ple she did not know, de­spite re­ceiv­ing re­peated warn­ings by the Com­mer­cial Affairs De­part­ment (CAD) not to do so.</p>
    <p>The funds, which Ng Koon Lay re­ceived in sums as high as US$88,000 (S$120,740), turned out to be pro­ceeds from scams.</p>
    <p>Ng was sen­tenced to 20 months’ jail yes­ter­day, af­ter plead­ing guilty to one charge of dis­hon­estly re­ceiv­ing stolen prop­erty, an­other re­lat­ing to trans­fer­ring crim­i­nal pro­ceeds, and two charges re­lat­ing to as­sist­ing an­other per­son to re­tain crim­i­nal pro­ceeds.</p>
    <p>An­other 16 sim­i­lar charges were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing by Dis­trict Judge Salina Ishak.</p>
    <p>Ng be­came ac­quainted with a “Greg L Johnson” through so­cial me­dia plat­form Face­book in 2015.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2016, Greg told Ng, who was in some fi­nan­cial dif­fi­culty, that a friend of his was will­ing to pro­vide a $9,000 loan to her.</p>
