    <p>As the coro­n­avirus rages, the young in Asia did not sit still.</p>
    <p>In China, com­mu­nity youth leader Xie Shang Wei helped to de­liver food to the el­derly poor liv­ing in Harbin city. In In­done­sia, un­der­grad­u­ates of Bo­gor Agri­cul­tural Univer­sity dis­trib­uted masks to villagers in ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Their ef­forts and those of four other groups from Sin­ga­pore were fea­tured in a video screened at a we­bi­nar yes­ter­day to show­case how young adults went to the aid of vic­tims of the virus.</p>
    <p>It was pro­duced by the Na­tional Youth Achieve­ment Award Coun­cil and Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences (SUSS).</p>
    <p>Its screen­ing was part of this year’s World News Day, with more than 150 me­dia ti­tles from across the globe com­ing to­gether to mark the oc­ca­sion with special re­ports, in­ter­views, we­bi­nars, shows and more.</p>
    <p>Among those tak­ing part were the Fi­nan­cial Times in the United King­dom; The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times from the United States; The Age and The Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald in Aus­tralia; The Cho­sun Ilbo in South Korea; and South China Morn­ing Post in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The day kicked off in Asia, where news­rooms from the Philip­pines to In­done­sia to South Korea joined in with ed­i­to­ri­als and events. These would con­tinue through the day as news­rooms around the world joined in across time zones.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, a we­bi­nar, ti­tled Covid-19: How Can You Con­trib­ute?, was live-streamed from the news­room of Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional broad­sheet, The Straits Times .</p>
    <p>In his open­ing re­marks, Mr Warren Fernandez, edi­tor of ST and pres­i­dent of the World Edi­tors Fo­rum, stressed the me­dia’s role in in­form­ing the masses and de­bunk­ing fake news, es­pe­cially dur­ing the cur­rent pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The world around us is get­ting more and more com­plex, it’s fast mov­ing and fast chang­ing. I think all of us could do with a lit­tle bit of help fig­ur­ing things out and stay­ing on top of de­vel­op­ments, of sep­a­rat­ing the facts from the fic­tion, of help­ing to join the dots and sort of in­ter­pret­ing where we are to­day and where things are mov­ing to­mor­row.”</p>
    <p>This be­comes ab­so­lutely crit­i­cal par­tic­u­larly in the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, added Mr Fernandez, who is also edi­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/ Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group.</p>
    <p>News­rooms have to step up to help peo­ple make sense of what cur­rent events mean for their lives and liveli­hoods, and pro­vide cred­i­ble in­for­ma­tion to help them stay safe and se­cure.</p>
    <p>But qual­ity jour­nal­ism, he added, is nei­ther free nor cheap. It takes hard work, com­mit­ment and re­sources, he added, not­ing that Covid-19 has hit many news­rooms hard, with sharp falls in ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enues. This would im­pact their abil­ity to serve their com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the we­bi­nar, two panel dis­cus­sions ex­plored how jour­nal­ists are tack­ling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The first fo­cused on the on­go­ing “in­fo­demic” dur­ing the pan­demic, with its surge of mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond panel dis­cus­sion, mod­er­ated by Viswa Sada­si­van, chief ex­ec­u­tive of con­sul­tancy firm Strate­gic Moves, Mr Fernandez; Dr June Tay, head of the dig­i­tal me­dia pro­gramme at the School of Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy in SUSS, and in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert Dale Fisher, spoke on is­sues of cred­i­bil­ity and trust in me­dia out­lets.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Fisher, who is group chief of medicine at the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem and chair­man of the steer­ing com­mit­tee for the Global Out­break Alert and Re­sponse Net­work at the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, high­lighted the role of ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tions in a public health cri­sis and the need for a re­spon­si­ble me­dia.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to de­liver qual­ity cov­er­age to read­ers dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break were also high­lighted in ST’s spe­cially pro­duced video, Jour­nal­ism Through A Pan­demic, yes­ter­day evening.</p>
    <p>The half-hour doc­u­men­tary on ST’s Face­book and YouTube pages fea­tures footage of its cor­re­spon­dents cov­er­ing the scourge across Asia, show­ing how news­rooms adapted to so­cial dis­tanc­ing and the ways in which news sto­ries have made an im­pact on na­tional poli­cies.</p>
    <p>The World News Day events will cul­mi­nate in a vir­tual pro­gramme by the Canadian Jour­nal­ism Foun­da­tion and World Edi­tors Fo­rum to­day at 7am (Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>It will fea­ture US Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases di­rec­tor An­thony Fauci and Philip­pine news web­site Rap­pler’s co-founder Maria Ressa.</p>
    <p>The we­b­cast will be hosted by CNN World­wide’s chief me­dia cor­re­spon­dent Brian Stel­ter, and fea­ture mu­si­cal per­for­mances by singers like Grammy win­ner Macy Gray.</p>
    <p>Those who are in­ter­ested in the we­b­cast can reg­is­ter for free on the World News Day web­site. Go to https://str.sg/wnd-event</p>
