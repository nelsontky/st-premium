    <p>PARIS • France’s hard­line In­te­rior Min­is­ter has vowed to root out ex­trem­ists af­ter a grisly mur­der in Paris.</p>
    <p>In say­ing he wanted to pre­serve a dis­tinctly French way of life, he risked the per­cep­tion he is tar­get­ing not just Is­lamists, but all Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>Al­most six years af­ter the satir­i­cal Char­lie Hebdo mag­a­zine was at­tacked for pub­lish­ing car­toons of the Prophet Muham­mad, France is still look­ing at ways to fight ex­trem­ism, and Mr Ger­ald Dar­manin ar­gues that mi­nor­ity groups who stay within their own com­mu­ni­ties are more vul­ner­a­ble to rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>His vi­sion for the coun­try in­cludes fewer halal butch­ers, eth­nic cloth­ing stores and even spe­cial­ist su­per­mar­ket aisles.</p>
    <p>“It al­ways shocked me to en­ter a su­per­mar­ket and see a shelf de­voted to the food of one com­mu­nity, and to an­other one next to it,” Mr Dar­manin told French tele­vi­sion last Tues­day. “Some peo­ple need to un­der­stand that win­ning mar­ket share by ap­peal­ing to ba­sic in­stincts does not nec­es­sar­ily con­trib­ute to the com­mon good.”</p>
    <p>As the coun­try tries to come to terms with the be­head­ing of a teacher in a leafy sub­urb of the cap­i­tal, the 38-year-old min­is­ter has be­come the pub­lic face of a crack­down whip­ping up sen­ti­ment against the broader Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“France is at war,” Mr Dar­manin said in the af­ter­math of the killing. “The ques­tion is not: Will we have an­other at­tack? The ques­tion is: When?”</p>
    <p>With far-right na­tion­al­ist Marine Le Pen pre­par­ing an­other fierce fight for the 2022 elec­tion, and the left wing look­ing for new al­ter­na­tives, Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron is try­ing to win over con­ser­va­tive vot­ers.</p>
    <p>In July, he handed the cru­cial se­cu­rity port­fo­lio to Mr Dar­manin, who has a work­ing-class, North African back­ground and an un­com­pro­mis­ing com­mit­ment to France’s sec­u­lar val­ues.</p>
    <p>Those ideas were shaped by his grand­fa­ther, an Al­ge­rian Mus­lim he calls “a hero of the Repub­lic”, who fought along­side the French dur­ing the war of in­de­pen­dence, and to whom he ded­i­cated a 2016 es­say on sec­u­lar­ism and Is­lam.</p>
    <p>In the es­say, Mr Dar­manin ex­tols the par­tic­u­lar French con­cep­tion of re­li­gion – that its ex­pres­sion should be pri­vate and pro­tected, kept out of the pub­lic sphere. He de­fends the idea of a state-spon­sored Is­lam for the coun­try’s es­ti­mated five mil­lion Mus­lims and calls for a ban on cloth­ing that “tends to dis­crim­i­nate against women”.</p>
    <p>It is not Is­lam that he can­not tol­er­ate, he said, it is ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>His of­fice points out that when he was mayor of Tour­co­ing, a town in north­ern France, he backed the con­struc­tion of a new mosque and gave a speech at its open­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Dar­manin emerged on the na­tional stage as a pro­tege of the right-wing for­mer pres­i­dent Ni­co­las Sarkozy and lashed out at Mr Macron dur­ing his elec­tion cam­paign, say­ing he should be ashamed for de­scrib­ing France’s colo­nial­i­sa­tion of Al­ge­ria as a crime against hu­man­ity and call­ing him “poi­son” for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In­stead of hold­ing a grudge, Mr Macron re­warded Mr Dar­manin with the Bud­get Min­istry be­fore el­e­vat­ing him to In­te­rior Min­is­ter – de­spite rape al­le­ga­tions dat­ing back to 2009. Mr Dar­manin said the af­fair was con­sen­sual, and Mr Macron said he be­lieves him.</p>
    <p>French his­to­rian and so­ci­ol­o­gist Pierre Birn­baum said Mr Dar­manin’s ap­proach to­wards rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion over­looks just how di­verse the coun­try is.</p>
    <p>“There was the idea that France was a uni­fied repub­lic, much more so than the US or the UK, but in prac­tice it ac­tu­ally ac­cepts many compromise­s.”</p>
