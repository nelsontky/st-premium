    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Sabah, which is Malaysia’s largest palm oil pro­duc­ing state, has or­dered plan­ta­tions, mills and re­finer­ies in four dis­tricts to shut amid two weeks of curbs on move­ment to rein in Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tions in the district of Ku­nak were sus­pended from yesterday un­til Oct 12, the district council said in a no­tice.</p>
    <p>“Ku­nak is not al­lowed to op­er­ate, in­clud­ing plan­ta­tions, mills and re­fin­ery,” Mr Christo­pher Chai, a gen­eral man­ager of Kwan­tas Corp based in the Malaysian state on the is­land of Bor­neo, told Reuters. “How­ever, own­ers have ap­pealed.”</p>
    <p>Sabah, which pro­duces 25 per cent of Malaysia’s crude palm out­put, im­posed the curbs in four dis­tricts on Mon­day, after a surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The surge i n Covid-19 cases comes after Sabah held elec­tions at the week­end, where the na­tion’s rul­ing coali­tion con­tin­ued its streak of vic­to­ries to win the key op­po­si­tion state amid chal­lenges to Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s premier­ship.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion was dogged by politi­cians test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus as the state be­came the new epi­cen­tre of Malaysia’s out­break.</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said that as part of ef­forts to con­tain the out­break, non-essen­tial busi­nesses in the four dis­tricts – La­had Datu, Tawau, Ku­nak and Sem­porna – had to close for 14 days, start­ing from yesterday.</p>
    <p>Malaysia on Sunday re­ported the high­est daily surge in coro­n­avirus cases since Sept 11, the ma­jor­ity of them in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials con­firmed 150 new in­fec­tions that day, ac­cord­ing to the Health Min­istry, with 124 in the Bor­neo state.</p>
    <p>There was one ad­di­tional death, also from Sabah, rais­ing the na­tional tally to 134.</p>
    <p>Another 115 new cases were re­ported on Mon­day, bring­ing the coun­try’s to­tal in­fec­tions since the out­break be­gan to 11,034.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the au­thor­i­ties have sta­tioned more health work­ers and equip­ment at Malaysia’s main Kuala Lumpur In­ter­na­tional Air­port to check on flight pas­sen­gers from Sabah, fol­low­ing com­plaints on so­cial me­dia that many had to queue be­tween three and six hours to get Covid-19 tests, The Star news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
