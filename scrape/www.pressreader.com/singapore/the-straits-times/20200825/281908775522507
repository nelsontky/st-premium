    <p>JERUSALEM • The United States will en­sure Is­rael re­tains a mil­i­tary ad­van­tage in the Mid­dle East un­der any fu­ture US arms deals with the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE), US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo has said.</p>
    <p>“The United States has a le­gal re­quire­ment with re­spect to qual­i­ta­tive mil­i­tary edge. We will con­tinue to hon­our that,” Mr Pom­peo said af­ter a meet­ing with Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu said he had been re­as­sured on the is­sue by Mr Pom­peo, who be­gan a Mid­dle East visit in Jerusalem that will show­case US sup­port for Is­raeli-Arab peace ef­forts and build­ing a front against Iran.</p>
    <p>A US-bro­kered deal on nor­mal­is­ing re­la­tions be­tween Is­rael and the UAE was an­nounced on Aug 13.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu said the deal with the Emi­rates “was a boon to peace and re­gional sta­bil­ity”. “I think it her­alds a new era where we could have other na­tions join,” he added.</p>
    <p>But there has been some dis­sent in Is­rael over the prospect of the UAE now ob­tain­ing ad­vanced US weaponry such as F-35 jets.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on CNN last Satur­day, se­nior White House ad­viser Jared Kush­ner said the UAE had been try­ing to get the F-35 for a long time.</p>
    <p>“This new peace agree­ment should in­crease the prob­a­bil­ity of them get­ting it. But it’s some­thing we’re re­view­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo said Washington had pro­vided the UAE with mil­i­tary sup­port for more than 20 years, mea­sures he de­scribed as needed to stave off shared threats from Iran – also Is­rael’s arch-foe.</p>
    <p>“We’re deeply com­mit­ted to do­ing that, to achiev­ing that and we’ll do it in a way that pre­serves our com­mit­ment to Is­rael and I’m con­fi­dent that ob­jec­tive will be achieved,” Mr Pom­peo said.</p>
    <p>Bruised by the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil’s re­jec­tion of a US draft res­o­lu­tion for ex­tend­ing an arms em­bargo on Iran, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is seek­ing a “snap­back” of UN sanc­tions that had been eased as part of a 2015 nu­clear deal with Teheran.</p>
    <p>“We are de­ter­mined to use every tool that we have to en­sure that they (Iran) can’t get ac­cess to high­end weapons sys­tems,” Mr Pom­peo said. “We think it’s in the best in­ter­est of the whole world.”</p>
    <p>The Pales­tini­ans warned the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion against try­ing to side­line them in the Mid­dle East diplo­matic push.</p>
    <p>“Re­cruit­ing Arabs to recog­nise Is­rael and open em­bassies does not make Is­rael a win­ner,” Pales­tinian ne­go­tia­tor Saeb Erekat said in an in­ter­view with Reuters.</p>
    <p>“You are putting the whole re­gion in a lose-lose sit­u­a­tion be­cause you are de­sign­ing the road for a for­ever con­flict in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>It was the first day of a Mid­dle East tour that the State De­part­ment said would also take Mr Pom­peo to Su­dan, the UAE and Bahrain.</p>
    <p>It said that he would meet Su­danese Prime Min­is­ter Abdalla Hamdok, Bahrain Crown Prince Sal­man Ha­mad Al-Khal­ifa and UAE For­eign Min­is­ter Ab­dul­lah Zayed Al-Nahyan.</p>
