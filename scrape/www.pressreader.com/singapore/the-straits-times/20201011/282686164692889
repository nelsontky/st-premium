    <p>Trixia En­riquez Carung­cong</p>
    <p>A one-off $3,000 grant to help par­ents amid the Covid-19 pan­demic set off a lively de­bate on­line among Straits Times Face­book users af­ter it was an­nounced on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mums and dads of Sin­ga­porean chil­dren born from the first day of this month to Sept 30, 2022, will re­ceive the Baby Sup­port Grant, on top of the ex­ist­ing Baby Bonus cash gift that can go up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>The amount will be de­posited from next April, or within one month of en­rol­ment into the Baby Bonus scheme, which­ever is later.</p>
    <p>While most ST Face­book users wel­comed the news, many asked why the grant will be given only to those with ba­bies born from this month on­wards.</p>
    <p>“Shouldn’t the Govern­ment give out the pack­age to those Sin­ga­porean fam­i­lies who had given birth since CB (cir­cuit breaker) started? Why only start Oc­to­ber 1st?” a user called Eliana Amin asked.</p>
    <p>A ne­ti­zen called PY started a pe­ti­tion on Fri­day on Change.org to ask the Govern­ment to ex­tend the grant to all par­ents whose ba­bies were born this year.</p>
    <p>“Any par­ent with new­borns born dur­ing this pan­demic would have faced some sort of fi­nan­cial stresses and in­con­ve­niences and would cer­tainly ben­e­fit from this ad­di­tional sup­port. Be­sides, Covid-19 had started since the start of 2020. There­fore, it would only be fair if the grant was of­fered to all par­ents of new­borns born in 2020,” the pe­ti­tion said.</p>
    <p>More than 7,600 had signed it as at yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>On the web­site, Kristyn Neo ex­plained her rea­son for back­ing it: “I had a baby right at the peak of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore and paid more for ser­vices due to... scarcity be­cause of the lock­down.”</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Pop­u­la­tion and Tal­ent Di­vi­sion (NPTD), which jointly ad­min­is­ters the Baby Sup­port Grant with the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, said it un­der­stands that some par­ents who have missed the start date may be dis­ap­pointed that they are not el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>“We would like to seek the pub­lic’s un­der­stand­ing that spe­cific start dates are needed for any new mea­sure or en­hance­ment,” NPTD said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>It added that chil­dren born be­fore Oct 1 are still able to en­joy many ben­e­fits un­der the Mar­riage and Par­ent­hood Pack­age.</p>
    <p>Bring­ing up a baby in Sin­ga­pore is ex­pen­sive, with one es­ti­mate in 2018 that it would cost a few hun­dred thou­sand dol­lars to more than half a mil­lion. That’s why any help should be wel­comed, other ST Face­book users ar­gued.</p>
    <p>Meng Tat Chang wrote: “All grants are (a) bonus. Peo­ple think that Govern­ment must pay peo­ple for ba­bies. Ba­bies are strictly for the joy of par­ent­hood, and grants are just by the way bonus as (an) ap­pre­ci­a­tion ges­ture by the state.”</p>
    <p>Zeus He said: “Quite frankly, if you wish to have a kid, you should be men­tally pre­pared for the costs of rais­ing a child. 3k will be handy. No mat­ter what pe­riod it might be, there will al­ways be com­plaints on why a per­son misses out on this.</p>
    <p>Not go­ing to please ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Indranee Ra­jah said on Fri­day that the Govern­ment hopes the grant will be a fur­ther boost that en­cour­ages cou­ples not to de­lay their plans to get mar­ried and start a fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Some wondered, though, if the amount would be enough to pro­vide that ex­tra push. Oth­ers felt that money was not the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Valiant Re­vane said: “Ac­tu­ally, most young cou­ples are not giv­ing birth be­cause they are not ready to sac­ri­fice their life­styles. Not so much (be­cause of) cost.”</p>
    <p>Bonus or no bonus, the de­cid­ing fac­tor could be whether cou­ples wish to take on the long-term re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of par­ent­hood.</p>
    <p>LY Lee said: “Young cou­ples to­day are afraid to have kids. It’s not so much the cost of hav­ing kids but bring­ing them up.”</p>
    <p>Keith Lim Wei Hoong wrote: “I had my first child 16 years ago and it’s just as dif­fi­cult now as it was in the past. If you want a fam­ily, you will find a way.”</p>
    <p>HAL­LOWEEN HOR­ROR</p>
    <p>It was one of those things we took for granted in the time be­fore Covid-19: hav­ing mind­less fun on Hal­loween, es­pe­cially if the day fell on a Fri­day or Satur­day. Many looked for haunted-house ex­pe­ri­ences, went trick-or-treat­ing or binged on hor­ror shows.</p>
    <p>But in a year with real-life pan­demic hor­rors, fun could be the last thing on some peo­ple’s minds. Making fun of Covid-19, in par­tic­u­lar, is deemed of­fen­sive by many.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, Ama­zon said it would be with­draw­ing coro­n­avirus-themed Hal­loween masks from sale, af­ter a Bri­tish char­ity said they were “hugely dis­taste­ful”.</p>
    <p>The masks, from one on­line re­tailer based in China, were de­signed to look like the coro­n­avirus – when seen un­der a mi­cro­scope – with its sig­na­ture spikes. Made of la­tex, they also fea­tured crazy-look­ing eyes and jagged teeth.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the oc­ca­sion won’t be the same with one pop­u­lar at­trac­tion, the Hal­loween Hor­ror Nights, not be­ing held this year at Univer­sal Stu­dios, although other ac­tiv­i­ties have been lined up.</p>
    <p>Events else­where will be muted, with an em­pha­sis on safe dis­tanc­ing and other safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>For those still plan­ning to go out and cel­e­brate in cos­tume, the Ore­gon Health Au­thor­ity in the United States tweeted this early re­minder: “Be care­ful to plan a cos­tume that al­lows you to wear a face cov­er­ing. #Hal­loween masks will not pro­tect you or oth­ers from #coro­n­avirus. In­stead, con­sider us­ing a Hal­loween-themed cloth mask.”</p>
