    <p>Be­ing re­trenched still stings, but the stigma once as­so­ci­ated with it is slowly dis­si­pat­ing, as lay­offs be­come in­creas­ingly com­mon­place amid the wors­en­ing global econ­omy due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple who have been laid off are tak­ing to so­cial me­dia plat­forms to find work, with a growing num­ber can­didly stat­ing in their cur­ricu­lum vitae (CV) or post that they have been re­trenched due to the fall­out from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The shift in mind­set stems from the ubiq­ui­tous im­pact of Covid-19 that has af­fected al­most ev­ery sec­tor of the econ­omy, said ex­perts, adding that there is no longer a neg­a­tive per­cep­tion of a per­son be­ing laid off, es­pe­cially if it is be­cause of the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem said: “The pan­demic has changed the no­tion of re­trench­ment, as it is an easy scape­goat to blame... It is never the worker’s fault, it is not even the com­pany’s fault, it is Covid-19’s fault.”</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary labour mar­ket data for the sec­ond quar­ter of this year showed that un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ments here have risen.</p>
    <p>The data re­leased on July 29 showed that re­trench­ments more than dou­bled in the sec­ond quar­ter, with 6,700 work­ers laid off, up from 3,220 in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>This was higher than the peak of 5,510 dur­ing the 2003 Sars out­break, but be­low the high of 12,760 dur­ing the 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In June, the num­ber of un­em­ployed lo­cal res­i­dents also climbed to 90,500, up from 76,200 in March.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said: “While work­ers are up­set that they are be­ing re­trenched, the stigma is less on the label of ‘kena re­trenched’, but more of be­ing a vic­tim of cir­cum­stances be­yond them.</p>
    <p>“So, yes, it is less of a stigma, as em­ploy­ers will be more un­der­stand­ing and re­cruiters more will­ing to give them a chance.”</p>
    <p>Tal­ent ac­qui­si­tion di­rec­tor at Quan­tum Leap Ca­reer Con­sul­tancy Alvin Ang said that given the fewer op­por­tu­ni­ties in the job mar­ket, the “sur­vival in­stinct” to find a new job kicks in, and can­di­dates fo­cus less on the stigma and in­stead con­cen­trate on get­ting a job.</p>
    <p>Ways to help re­trenched em­ploy­ees have also emerged on­line through so­cial me­dia plat­forms and tal­ent di­rec­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Last month, for ex­am­ple, LinkedIn in­tro­duced a fea­ture where users can at­tach a green ban­ner to their pro­file pic­ture with the words #Open­towork that will let re­cruiters and those in one’s net­work know that the per­son is open to job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>One of those who have adopted the #Open­towork ban­ner is for­mer busi­ness an­a­lyst Sriv­id­hya Gana­p­a­thy Sun­daram, 29, who said on her pro­file that she was “re­trenched due to Covid”.</p>
    <p>She said: “I am not ashamed to say that I lost my job due to Covid-19; in fact, it helps me to con­nect with oth­ers who are in sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tions, or po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>“With the im­pact be­ing felt world­wide, we have to know we are not alone in this.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some multi­na­tional com­pa­nies which have laid off work­ers in Sin­ga­pore, such as Airbnb and Grab, have also taken the ini­tia­tive to start tal­ent di­rec­to­ries for af­fected em­ploy­ees in the hope of giv­ing them more ex­po­sure to job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Not only do these meth­ods im­prove the chances of the job search, but they also re­flect well on the firms, which are seen to be com­pas­sion­ate and have pro­gres­sive hu­man re­source prac­tices, said Ms Low.</p>
    <p>“It also au­gurs well with the mes­sage that these are not poor per­form­ers, but val­ued team mem­bers whom you have to let go be­cause of Covid-19 and the busi­ness sit­u­a­tion,” she said, adding that such di­rec­to­ries also act as an as­sur­ance by the re­leas­ing com­pany of the qual­ity of the re­trenched can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>“This shifts the mind­set of ‘I am re­trenched and no longer val­ued as an em­ployee’ to ‘I am so val­ued that the com­pany cares enough to go out of the way to find me a new em­ployer’,” noted Ms Low.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang said that this change in per­spec­tive is also some­thing re­cruiters have taken no­tice of in can­di­dates look­ing for jobs.</p>
    <p>“There used to be a tinge of hes­i­ta­tion when they were ex­plain­ing how they came to be un­em­ployed. Some would couch it to say they left am­i­ca­bly, it was some­thing they would not be will­ing to ad­mit straight­away,” he said.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates are now more up­front about be­ing laid off. “It is a hall­mark of a gen­er­a­tional shift. The older gen­er­a­tion, those in their late 40s and 50s, might be more wor­ried about the stigma of re­trench­ment,” said Mr Ang. “But the younger gen­er­a­tion are more open and use so­cial me­dia to find their next op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Still, said Ms Low, the sting of re­trench­ment is al­ways an aw­ful and un­set­tling feel­ing.</p>
    <p>“While per­cep­tions may change and re­trench­ments dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic are less of a stigma... to the re­trenched worker, ev­ery re­jec­tion is a dis­ap­point­ment,” she said.</p>
