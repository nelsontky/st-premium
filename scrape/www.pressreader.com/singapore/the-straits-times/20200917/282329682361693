    <p>• Mi­ami Heat big man Bam Ade­bayo made the big­gest block of his ca­reer with 5.1 sec­onds left in over­time as the Mi­ami Heat beat the Bos­ton Celtics 117-114 in the open­ing game of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Eastern Con­fer­ence fi­nals at Dis­ney World on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond game-win­ning play by the Heat in the fi­nal 12 sec­onds. Mo­ments ear­lier, Jimmy But­ler fought through traf­fic for the go-ahead bucket, draw­ing a foul and mak­ing the free throw to put Mi­ami up 116-114.</p>
    <p>Ade­bayo t hen up­staged his team­mate, leap­ing high to take what ap­peared to be an easy dunk away from Jayson Ta­tum before hit­ting a free throw the other end.</p>
    <p>“Bam’s block on Jayson Ta­tum’s dunk at­tempt was the best de­fen­sive play I’ve seen ever in the play­offs!!!!,” tweeted Los An­ge­les Lak­ers leg­end Magic John­son.</p>
    <p>Ade­bayo l abelled it his best play. “Play-offs, game on the line, num­ber one play,” the 23-yearold said.</p>
    <p>Ta­tum missed on a three-point at­tempt as time ex­pired, en­sur­ing the Heat’s ninth win in 10 games. “He made a great play,” the Celtics for­ward, who led all scor­ers with 30 points, said of the block. “Can’t do any­thing about it.”</p>
    <p>Ade­bayo added 18 points and nine as­sists, But­ler scored 20, Jae Crow­der had 22 while Go­ran Dragic led the Heat with 29 points with seven re­bounds.</p>
    <p>Ade­bayo has gone from strength to strength in his break­through sea­son. He av­er­aged 15.9 points, 10.2 re­bounds and 5.1 as­sists per game in the reg­u­lar sea­son to get his first All-Star nod in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Go­ing into Game 1, he had 16.2 points, 11.7 boards and 4.8 as­sists a game in the play-offs. He came out of it hear­ing the bas­ket­ball world talk about the sec­ond of his two blocks.</p>
    <p>“That sealed the game for us... (Ade­bayo is) a huge part to why we’re win­ning – I’ve been say­ing it all year long, and I’ll re­peat it again,” But­ler said.</p>
    <p>Mar­cus Smart scored 26 and Kemba Walker had 19 points for the Celtics, who will have to bounce in Game 2 to­day.</p>
    <p>Bos­ton last made the NBA Fi­nals a decade ago, while Mi­ami’s last trip was in 2014.</p>
