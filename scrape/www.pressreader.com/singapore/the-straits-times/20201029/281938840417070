    <p>Q Are our views on in­equal­ity and pol­icy pref­er­ences af­fected by the in­for­ma­tion we con­sume?</p>
    <p>A The 2,153 wealth­i­est in­di­vid­u­als in the world are richer than 60 per cent of the global pop­u­la­tion, ac­cord­ing to an Ox­fam re­port this year.</p>
    <p>While eco­nomic in­equal­ity is re­garded by some to be the defin­ing chal­lenge of our time, oth­ers shrug it off. Why are our views on in­equal­ity so di­ver­gent, and do we ad­just our views when we are pre­sented with new in­for­ma­tion?</p>
    <p>Sev­eral stud­ies have in­ves­ti­gated whether in­for­ma­tion shapes views on in­equal­ity and pol­icy pref­er­ences. Par­tic­i­pants were ran­domly as­signed to dif­fer­ent groups that re­ceived dif­fer­ent types of in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In one study by Berke­ley, Har­vard and Prince­ton uni­ver­si­ties, a group was given in­for­ma­tion on in­come in­equal­ity and tax poli­cies in the United States. The in­for­ma­tion had large ef­fects on views about in­equal­ity, but small ef­fects on tax pol­icy pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>The au­thors the­o­rised that the in­signif­i­cant ef­fects on pol­icy pref­er­ences could be due to re­spon­dents’ mis­trust of the gov­ern­ment and in­abil­ity to per­ceive how pub­lic poli­cies can af­fect the level of in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Another type of study cor­rects in­di­vid­u­als’ mis­per­cep­tions of how their in­come com­pares with oth­ers’.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey on Swedes, 85.8 per cent of re­spon­dents un­der­es­ti­mated their po­si­tion in the in­come dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>A sub-sam­ple of re­spon­dents was then in­formed of their ac­tual po­si­tion in the in­come dis­tri­bu­tion. Those told they were richer than they thought de­manded less re­dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>A third type of study ma­nip­u­lates re­spon­dents’ be­liefs about so­cial mo­bil­ity or in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Economists at Har­vard and North­west­ern uni­ver­si­ties ex­plored how per­cep­tions of mo­bil­ity in­flu­enced pref­er­ences for re­dis­tri­bu­tion in France, Italy, Swe­den, the United King­dom and the United States.</p>
    <p>A group was given pes­simistic in­for­ma­tion about mo­bil­ity, and con­se­quently ex­pressed more sup­port for re­dis­tri­bu­tion, mostly for “equal­ity of op­por­tu­nity” poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Another study in­ves­ti­gated how re­spon­dents’ be­liefs about in­equal­ity af­fected their pref­er­ence for re­dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey ex­per­i­ment in South Africa, a group was shown in­for­ma­tion on how South Africa is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing much higher lev­els of in­equal­ity than many other coun­tries while another – the con­trol group – was not.</p>
    <p>The in­for­ma­tion re­duced the first group of re­spon­dents’ be­liefs that in­equal­ity is in­evitable, and in­creased their sup­port for re­dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Are Sin­ga­pore­ans’ views on in­equal­ity and pol­icy pref­er­ences in­flu­enced by in­for­ma­tion?</p>
    <p>We con­ducted a study on 404 Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore stu­dents to ex­plore whether in­for­ma­tion af­fects peo­ple’s views on in­equal­ity and pol­icy pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents were ran­domly as­signed to one of three groups: con­trol, Treat­ment 1 (pos­i­tive nar­ra­tive), and Treat­ment 2 (neg­a­tive nar­ra­tive). The con­trol group did not re­ceive any in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Treat­ment 1 re­ceived a pos­i­tive nar­ra­tive high­light­ing these ar­gu­ments:</p>
    <p>• Low cor­po­rate tax rates en­cour­age for­eign in­vest­ment while low in­di­vid­ual tax rates pro­mote hard work and en­trepreneur­ship.</p>
    <p>• For­eign tal­ent can boost our com­pet­i­tive­ness and com­ple­ment the do­mes­tic labour force. Treat­ment 1 con­tended that such poli­cies have helped to fos­ter eco­nomic growth. House­holds in all in­come deciles ex­pe­ri­enced growth in their in­comes be­tween 2013 and 2018, and those in the bot­tom quin­tile of the in­come dis­tri­bu­tion ex­pe­ri­enced marginally higher in­come growth than those in the top quin­tile.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, Treat­ment 2 re­ceived a neg­a­tive nar­ra­tive high­light­ing that:</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s tax sys­tem has be­come in­creas­ingly less pro­gres­sive. While cor­po­rate and per­sonal in­come taxes have largely fallen over the last few decades, the goods and ser­vices tax – a re­gres­sive tax – has in­creased. Mean­while, cap­i­tal gains (prof­its from the sale of prop­erty, stocks or bonds) – a source of in­come for the rich but not the poor – are not taxed at all. The in­flux of for­eign work­ers has de­pressed the wages of Sin­ga­pore­ans at the bot­tom of the wage dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Treat­ment 2 con­tended that tax and im­mi­gra­tion poli­cies have po­ten­tially ex­ac­er­bated in­equal­ity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The in­come gap widened be­tween 2000 and 2018; av­er­age in­comes at the top decile dou­bled, whereas those in the bot­tom decile ap­peared stag­nant.</p>
    <p>So, is in­equal­ity in Sin­ga­pore a prob­lem?</p>
    <p>Rel­a­tive to the con­trol group, those as­signed to Treat­ment 2 (neg­a­tive nar­ra­tive) were 9 per cent less likely to agree that in­equal­ity is a small prob­lem or not a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Is be­ing rich or poor due more to in­di­vid­ual merit or cir­cum­stances?</p>
    <p>Rel­a­tive to the con­trol group, those as­signed to Treat­ment 1 (pos­i­tive nar­ra­tive) were more likely to agree that be­ing rich is due more to in­di­vid­ual merit than to cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, those as­signed to Treat­ment 2 (neg­a­tive nar­ra­tive) were 22 per cent more likely than the con­trol group to agree that be­ing rich is due more to cir­cum­stances than to in­di­vid­ual merit.</p>
    <p>Should a cap­i­tal gains tax be in­tro­duced in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>Those as­signed to Treat­ment 2 (neg­a­tive nar­ra­tive) were 13 per cent more likely than the con­trol group to agree that a cap­i­tal gains tax should be in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>Should the num­ber of Em­ploy­ment Pass, S Pass and work per­mit hold­ers be in­creased, be de­creased or stay the same?</p>
    <p>Those as­signed to Treat­ment 1 (pos­i­tive nar­ra­tive) were 12 per cent more likely than the con­trol group to sup­port in­creas­ing the num­ber of Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers and 8 per cent more likely to sup­port in­creas­ing the num­ber of S Pass and work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Our study sug­gests that in­for­ma­tion does have some ef­fect on Sin­ga­pore­ans’ views on in­equal­ity and pol­icy pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>There­fore, ex­po­sure to dif­fer­ent sources of cred­i­ble in­for­ma­tion is crit­i­cal if we are to have thought­ful and in­formed pub­lic dis­course.</p>
    <p>While eco­nomic in­equal­ity is re­garded by some to be the defin­ing chal­lenge of our time, oth­ers shrug it off. Why are our views on in­equal­ity so di­ver­gent, and do we ad­just our views when we are pre­sented with new in­for­ma­tion?</p>
