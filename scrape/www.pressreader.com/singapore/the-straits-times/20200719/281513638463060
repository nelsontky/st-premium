    <p>In the lead-up to polling day on July 10, one of the is­sues that resur­faced in op­po­si­tion party man­i­festos and cam­paigns was a call for a min­i­mum wage and re­dun­dancy in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>The Work­ers’ Party (WP), for in­stance, pro­posed a na­tional min­i­mum take-home wage of $1,300 a month for full-time work, the amount an av­er­age four-per­son house­hold in Sin­ga­pore needs to spend on ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties such as food, cloth­ing and shel­ter each month.</p>
    <p>The party also pro­posed a re­dun­dancy in­sur­ance scheme for work­ers, un­der which they pay $4 a month, matched by em­ploy­ers, into an Em­ploy­ment Security Fund which pays out 40 per cent of their last-drawn salary for up to six months if they are re­trenched.</p>
    <p>The pay­out would be capped at $1,200 a month, with a min­i­mum pay­out of $500 a month for low-wage work­ers.</p>
    <p>Work­ers can re­ceive more pay­outs only if they ac­tively seek a new job or go for re­train­ing.</p>
    <p>Other par­ties, such as the Re­form Party and the Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party (SDP) also called for a min­i­mum wage, with SDP chair­man Paul Tam­byah, who con­tested in Bukit Pan­jang SMC, say­ing that a min­i­mum wage must ap­ply to for­eign­ers as well as lo­cals so that qual­i­fied peo­ple come to work here and are not ex­ploited by be­ing made to work at a lower salary than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>But Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam said at a live talk show on July 7 that Sin­ga­pore’s pro­gres­sive wage model is bet­ter than a min­i­mum wage be­cause it is a lad­der, of which a min­i­mum wage would be only the first step.</p>
    <p>The model sets out min­i­mum salaries for lo­cal work­ers in var­i­ous roles along a ca­reer and skills pro­gres­sion frame­work.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man said that the model, which is com­pul­sory in the clean­ing, security and land­scap­ing sec­tors, will be spread across all sec­tors.</p>
    <p>He added that the Gov­ern­ment’s ap­proach of pro­vid­ing jobs for ev­ery­one and im­prov­ing jobs over time re­quires a step-by-step ap­proach, “not a sud­den or dras­tic ap­proach that risks peo­ple los­ing their jobs, but a steady ap­proach that gives peo­ple con­fi­dence that they are im­prov­ing in their jobs, and gives em­ploy­ers con­fi­dence that the Gov­ern­ment is go­ing to work with them to help them to up­grade pro­duc­tiv­ity”.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong also ad­dressed the is­sue in his on­line Fuller­ton elec­tion rally on July 6, say­ing that calls for a min­i­mum wage or a univer­sal ba­sic in­come are “fash­ion­able peace­time slo­gans, not se­ri­ous wartime plans”, re­fer­ring to the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>He said that a min­i­mum wage would add to em­ploy­ers’ costs and pres­sure them to let even more work­ers go.</p>
    <p>LONG-TIME DE­BATE</p>
    <p>The calls for a min­i­mum wage and un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance are not new.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in the lead-up to the 2001 Gen­eral Elec­tion, SDP chief Chee Soon Juan called for a min­i­mum wage of $5 per hour.</p>
    <p>He also said the Gov­ern­ment should pay re­trenched work­ers their last-drawn salary for six months, half the last-drawn salary for a fur­ther six months and then a quar­ter for a fur­ther six months. Dur­ing the 18 months, the worker should be al­lowed to re­ject only three job of­fers.</p>
    <p>Dr Chee has also said in the past that the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment scheme, which tops up the in­comes of lower-in­come work­ers aged 35 and above and earn­ing up to $2,300 a month, re­in­forces a master-ser­vant ar­range­ment both eco­nom­i­cally and psy­cho­log­i­cally.</p>
    <p>In 2006, in the WP’s first man­i­festo since 1994, it called for the min­i­mum wage in col­lec­tive agree­ments be­tween unions and com­pa­nies to be strictly en­forced, and for un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance with pay­outs start­ing at 75 per cent of last-drawn pay. Sin­ga­pore­ans in dire straits should be al­lowed to draw on their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund sav­ings, it said.</p>
    <p>The is­sues have also come up be­tween elec­tions, such as dur­ing Bud­get de­bates.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mist and for­mer Nom­i­nated MP Wal­ter Th­e­seira, dur­ing the sup­ple­men­tary Bud­get de­bate in April, sug­gested that all Sin­ga­pore­ans re­ceive $110 a week for 12 weeks amid the Covid-19 cri­sis, funded through a tem­po­rary per­sonal in­come tax hike of 4.25 per cent, paid next year when the econ­omy is ex­pected to have re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Un­der his pro­posal, dubbed the Ma­ju­lah Univer­sal Ba­sic In­come Scheme, the less well-off will ben­e­fit more, while the high-in­come will help to finance it.</p>
    <p>The WP also launched an on­line pa­per in De­cem­ber 2016 propos­ing an un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance scheme.</p>
    <p>PM Lee had said in his May Day Rally speech ear­lier that year that Sin­ga­pore has a bet­ter ap­proach in which the Gov­ern­ment funds pro­grammes to sup­port work­ers mak­ing the ef­fort to get back into a job and up­grade their skills to make them­selves more valu­able.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has rolled out schemes such as pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes, which fund part of the course fees and the salary or train­ing al­lowance for mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) en­ter­ing new oc­cu­pa­tions or growth sec­tors.</p>
    <p>It launched the Ca­reer Sup­port Pro­gramme in 2015 to pro­vide salary sub­si­dies to em­ploy­ers who hire re­trenched or long-term un­em­ployed Sin­ga­porean PMETs, as well as a hir­ing in­cen­tive this year for em­ploy­ers who hire lo­cal work­ers through cer­tain reskilling and train­ing pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>THE EX­IST­ING MODEL</p>
    <p>The pro­gres­sive wage model was first rolled out by the Na­tional Trades Union Congress in 2012, un­der then labour chief Lim Swee Say, in sec­tors such as clean­ing, trans­port and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>At the start, the wage bench­marks were rec­om­men­da­tions, but they later be­came com­pul­sory as part of li­cens­ing con­di­tions for the clean­ing, security and land­scap­ing sec­tors. They are com­pul­sory for lift main­te­nance firms in or­der to be awarded gov­ern­ment con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ingly, they func­tion as sec­tor-spe­cific min­i­mum wages for work­ers of var­i­ous skill lev­els.</p>
    <p>The model is also up­dated so that the wages rise over time.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, when the model be­came com­pul­sory for full-time res­i­dent clean­ers un­der new con­tracts in Septem­ber 2014, those in of­fices and hawker cen­tres had to be paid ba­sic monthly wages of at least $1,000, while town council clean­ers had to be paid at least $1,200.</p>
    <p>From July 1, their ba­sic wages must be $1,236 and $1,442 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Su­per­vi­sors had to be paid at least $1,600 in 2014. Now, the base salary is $1,854.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man said in his July 7 speech that the model has helped work­ers in the lower-in­come group, around the 20th per­centile of the in­come lad­der, see their wages rise by close to 40 per cent in the last 10 years in real terms, or af­ter in­fla­tion is taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>In nom­i­nal terms, the pay of the 20th per­centile worker has risen from about $1,500 10 years ago to $2,500 now, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the Gov­ern­ment also pro­vides Work­fare and the Spe­cial Em­ploy­ment Credit – a wage sub­sidy for em­ploy­ers of older work­ers – which come up to an ex­tra 40 per cent on top of what em­ploy­ers pay the work­ers.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad also told Par­lia­ment in March that be­tween 2013 and 2018, the real me­dian monthly gross wages of full-time clean­ers, security of­fi­cers and land­scape work­ers grew cu­mu­la­tively by around 30 per cent, 31 per cent and 32 per cent re­spec­tively. This was faster than the growth of 16 per cent at the me­dian over the same pe­riod, for res­i­dents in full-time work.</p>
    <p>How­ever, WP’s newly elected Sengkang GRC MP Ja­mus Lim said in a Face­book post on July 14 that as the pro­gres­sive wage model ties wages to job func­tion, it gives too much room to em­ploy­ers to cut corners, with­out re­dress­ing power dif­fer­en­tials.</p>
    <p>“It also leaves those who sim­ply can­not up­skill in the lurch, and earn­ing be­low a liv­ing wage,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Chee has in the past re­ferred to the pro­gres­sive wage model as an in­stance of the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party copy­ing SDP’s pro­posed univer­sal min­i­mum wage, but in piece­meal.</p>
    <p>“(They) call it by an­other name, but it’s still the min­i­mum wage for se­lected in­dus­tries,” said Dr Chee in the lead-up to the 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>DIS­CUS­SION CON­TIN­UES</p>
    <p>Even af­ter the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion, the de­bate on the need for a min­i­mum wage con­tin­ues, which many have said is a good sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Lim’s Face­book post also said that min­i­mum wage “is not un­abashedly good pol­icy”, but it would not have to cost the Gov­ern­ment as most min­i­mum wage mod­els have no fis­cal im­pact, with three quar­ters of the bur­den borne by higher prices con­sumers pay, and one quar­ter by firms.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple crit­i­cised him for not hav­ing talked about the cost in­crease pre­vi­ously, which for­mer Non-Con­stituency MP Yee Jenn Jong, who was in the WP team which con­tested in Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC this year, sought to ad­dress in a sep­a­rate Face­book post in which he cited a re­cent survey com­mis­sioned by The Sun­day Times which found that eight out of 10 Sin­ga­pore­ans are will­ing to pay more for es­sen­tial ser­vices such as clean­ing and security if the ex­tra amount goes to the work­ers them­selves.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man, who is Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies, had him­self said at the talk show ear­lier this month that as wages rise for lower-in­come work­ers, some costs will go up, such as costs of con­ser­vancy in con­do­mini­ums and clean­ing of of­fices.</p>
    <p>But in keep­ing with his prom­ise in an ear­lier na­tional broad­cast last month that the Gov­ern­ment will pro­vide greater sup­port for lower- and mid­dle-in­come Sin­ga­pore­ans and build a fair and just so­ci­ety, he added: “All of us as Sin­ga­pore­ans will have to pay slightly higher costs. But that is a small cost to pay for build­ing a fairer and more eq­ui­table so­ci­ety, where ev­ery­one is mov­ing up to­gether.”</p>
    <p>At the start, the wage bench­marks were rec­om­men­da­tions, but they later be­came com­pul­sory as part of li­cens­ing con­di­tions for the clean­ing, security and land­scap­ing sec­tors. They are com­pul­sory for lift main­te­nance firms in or­der to be awarded gov­ern­ment con­tracts. Ac­cord­ingly, they func­tion as sec­tor-spe­cific min­i­mum wages for work­ers of var­i­ous skill lev­els.</p>
