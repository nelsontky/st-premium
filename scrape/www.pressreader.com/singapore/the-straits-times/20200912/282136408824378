    <p>Peo­ple can try their hand at colour­ing tra­di­tional Per­anakan tiles and mak­ing bracelets in Chi­na­town this week­end as the Chi­na­town Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion (CBA) tries to draw the crowds back to the once bustling area.</p>
    <p>Shops and eater­ies in the her­itage site were hit badly by the dra­matic fall in tourist num­bers over the past few months amid the Covid-19 pandemic and travel restric­tions.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age lo­cals to visit the area, the CBA has or­gan­ised a range of work­shops where vis­i­tors will be shown how to make Chi­nese knot­ted bracelets, grow their own veg­eta­bles and herbs, and colour Per­anakan tiles with mark­ers.</p>
    <p>Booths have been set up in Sago Street for these ac­tiv­i­ties, with at­ten­dance capped at groups of five. Other at­trac­tions in­clude old­school games such as hop­scotch and snakes and lad­ders.</p>
    <p>CBA ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Lim Yick Suan said she hoped the ac­tiv­i­ties would “in­crease do­mes­tic traf­fic to Chi­na­town, strength­en­ing its po­si­tion as a cul­tural, her­itage-rich hot spot”.</p>
    <p>She added that Covid-19 pre­ven­tive mea­sures will be in place. These in­clude tem­per­a­ture tak­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing and pe­ri­odic clean­ing of work­shop tools.</p>
    <p>Ms Amelia Tay, 34, is among those keen to visit the area over the week­end, say­ing that she will</p>
    <p>be tak­ing her five-year-old daugh­ter, An­drea, to Chi­na­town this week­end.</p>
    <p>“It’ll be fun to ex­pose her to the games I used to play as a child and hope­fully she will learn some­thing from the work­shops,” Ms Tay said.</p>
    <p>These her­itage-themed ac­tiv­i­ties form part of a monthly line-up of events in Chi­na­town.</p>
    <p>A se­ries of “well­ness work­shops” is ten­ta­tively slated for next month, where herbal tea ten­ants will share the health ben­e­fits of their reme­dies.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one is con­vinced about the ef­fi­cacy of these events.</p>
    <p>Mr Lucas Tok, lec­turer and mar­ket­ing com­pe­tency lead at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s Busi­ness School, said that busi­nesses in the area have to re­duce their re­liance on tourist dol­lars and reach out in­stead to lo­cals through e-com­merce plat­forms if they hope to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>“Places like Tiong Bahru and Keong Saik are able to bring in lo­cals with­out los­ing their rich her­itage and they can be seen as a blueprint of how Chi­na­town can evolve,” he said</p>
    <p>The CBA de­clined to re­veal how many Chi­na­town stores have closed since Jan­uary, or how far re­tail sales have fallen com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. But a hand­ful of street ven­dors and re­tail­ers con­tacted by The Straits Times said sales had plunged by at least 50 per cent since travel restric­tions were im­posed.</p>
    <p>Ms Jane Yee, 60, a store­keeper at Feng Shui Spe­cial­ist, said the shop sell­ing sou­venirs and reli­gious para­pher­na­lia for the past 16 years would close in a month or two.</p>
    <p>“We are try­ing to cut our losses by sell­ing the re­main­ing stock at 50 per cent dis­count,” she said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>Ms Wang Shan Shan, 36, a wait­ress at hot­pot skew­ers restau­rant Li Ji Chuan Chuan Xiang, said busi­ness had dropped by 50 per cent when the tourists stopped com­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamad Jahubar, a shop as­sis­tant at Vic­to­ria Gift Cen­tre, which sells hand­i­crafts and col­lectibles, said busi­ness has fallen by more than 80 per cent since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>He said that wage sub­si­dies from the Gov­ern­ment had helped but the shop own­ers have had to dig into their sav­ings to keep the busi­ness go­ing.</p>
