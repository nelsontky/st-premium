    <p>Re­al­is­ing that el­derly residents at nurs­ing homes were par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble to Covid-19, Ms Tay Yee Kian stepped up to train com­mu­nity nurses to better care for them.</p>
    <p>The as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of nurs­ing at the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem’s (NUHS) Re­gional Health Sys­tem Of­fice led her team to su­per­vise the op­er­a­tional set-up for swab test­ing at 15 nurs­ing homes in the west of Singapore. She also coached 89 nurses across the homes in in­fec­tion con­trol mea­sures, such as don­ning and doff­ing per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, and na­sopha­ryn­geal swab test­ing.</p>
    <p>“Some nurses, who were ini­tially very ap­pre­hen­sive, were very ap­pre­cia­tive that we were there to pro­vide them with the nec­es­sary guid­ance and sup­port. Some of the nurses even told me proudly that they have trained more of their nurs­ing col­leagues to sup­port the test­ing,” said Ms Tay, 51.</p>
    <p>She also led a team of com­mu­nity nurses in screen­ing and swab­bing for­eign work­ers at the dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay, who be­came a nurse at Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal in 1989, said train­ing and men­tor­ing young nurses has al­ways been her pas­sion. “I be­lieve the knowl­edge I have gained from many se­niors be­fore me should be passed on, so that many more can ben­e­fit from their wis­dom as I have. I hope they can pass this knowl­edge on to their ju­niors as well, so in this way our pro­fes­sion can be­come stronger,” she added.</p>
    <p>Armed with 25 years of in-pa­tient nurs­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, she joined the NUHS’ Re­gional Health Sys­tem Of­fice in 2014 to set up a com­mu­nity nurs­ing unit. As a com­mu­nity nurse, she worked with pa­tients in their homes.</p>
    <p>“Our com­mu­nity team does not have equip­ment or re­sources such as those avail­able in the hos­pi­tal. This re­quires us to be in­no­va­tive, adapt­able and clin­i­cally adept, so that we can con­tinue to pro­vide care to our pa­tients,” said Ms Tay, who now leads a team of over 50 nurses and al­lied health pro­fes­sion­als to de­velop com­mu­nity nurs­ing in the western part of Singapore.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay said that she feels blessed and hon­oured to re­ceive the Pres­i­dent’s Award for Nurses.</p>
    <p>“This award speaks for the grow­ing sig­nif­i­cance of com­mu­nity nurs­ing in Singapore – in­creas­ingly, care is be­ing pro­vided in the com­mu­nity and in homes of pa­tients, as we adopt a pa­tient-cen­tric per­spec­tive and bring care to pa­tients.”</p>
