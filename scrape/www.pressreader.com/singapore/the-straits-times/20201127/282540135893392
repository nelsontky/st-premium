    <p>BUENOS AIRES • Ar­gen­tini­ans lined up in the streets of the coun­try’s cap­i­tal yes­ter­day to say good­bye to foot­ball leg­end and their great­est hero Diego Maradona, whose cas­ket lay in state at the Casa Rosada pres­i­den­tial palace, draped in an Ar­gentina flag and his iconic No. 10 shirt.</p>
    <p>The 1986 World Cup win­ner, whose ex­ploits on the pitch was marred by strug­gles with al­co­hol and drug ad­dic­tion and obe­sity, died in his sleep fol­low­ing a heart at­tack at home on Wed­nes­day. He was 60.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to John Broyad, the prose­cu­tor gen­eral of the Ar­gen­tinian town of San Isidro, ev­ery­thing in­di­cated Maradona died of “nat­u­ral causes”, al­though the re­sults of tox­i­col­ogy tests will only be known later.</p>
    <p>But the ini­tial au­topsy did not stop his l awyer, Ma­tias Morla, from call­ing for a full in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the cir­cum­stances of Maradona’s death. Maradona had var­i­ous health prob­lems and weeks ago had un­der­gone surgery for a blood clot in his head.</p>
    <p>Morla tweeted: “It is in­ex­pli­ca­ble that for 12 hours my friend has had no at­ten­tion or check-up from the per­son­nel ded­i­cated to these ends. The am­bu­lance took more than half an hour to ar­rive, which was a crim­i­nal id­iocy.”</p>
    <p>Huge crowds are ex­pected to pay their re­spects as part of three days of na­tional mourn­ing.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands had al­ready formed a</p>
    <p>snaking line through the streets near the cen­tral Plaza de Mayo af­ter spend­ing the pre­vi­ous night mourn­ing and rem­i­nisc­ing.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands ear­lier took to the streets to mourn him, de­fy­ing Covid-19 curbs on gath­er­ings to leave flow­ers and mes­sages at his child­hood home and for­mer club Boca Ju­niors. At 10pm on Wed­nes­day, an hour cho­sen to match the num­ber he wore, sta­di­ums across Ar­gentina turned on their flood­lights to hon­our his mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Boca, the club he had sup­ported as a child, turned off all the lights at their La Bom­bon­era sta­dium, only leav­ing Maradona’s box lit up.</p>
    <p>Some scuf­fles broke out as fans tried to get in­side the palace to see the great, who starred for Napoli and Barcelona among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“Maradona for me is the great­est thing that hap­pened to me in life. I love him as much as my fa­ther and it’s like my old man died,” tear­ful</p>
    <p>Boca fan Cris­tian Mon­telli said af­ter see­ing the wooden cof­fin.</p>
    <p>An­other fan Dario Lozano said: “Diego be­longs to the peo­ple, Diego be­longs to Ar­gentina, Diego be­longs to the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Boca fan Mauro Gimenez added: “I think ev­ery­one to­day felt like some­thing had died, your child­hood died, your mother died, your fa­ther died, this is what it feels like. You can’t ex­plain what Diego made you feel when he played. You had to have pas­sion and then you would know what Diego was – hap­pi­ness, sad­ness, re­bel­lion.”</p>
    <p>Teary-eyed fans, held back by a bar­rier, threw foot­ball jer­seys, flow­ers and other items to­wards the cas­ket as they tried to get near the body of Maradona, who had god-like sta­tus in Ar­gentina de­spite his well-doc­u­mented flaws.</p>
    <p>“He was some­one who touched the sky with his hands but never took his feet off the ground,” Ar</p>
    <p>gen­tinian Pres­i­dent Al­berto Fer­nan­dez said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor ath­letes like Cris­tiano Ron­aldo and Ar­gentina skip­per Lionel Messi, as well as world lead­ers, in­clud­ing Ar­gentina-born Pope Fran­cis, paid trib­ute, while Span­ish daily AS’ front-page head­line read, “D10S has died” – a play on dios, the Span­ish word for God.</p>
    <p>Raised in the Buenos Aires slum of Villa Fior­ito, where he honed his game, he turned pro by 15, a sign of his prodi­gious ta­lent. He had stints with Barcelona and Napoli and sin­gle-hand­edly dragged Ar­gentina to their sec­ond World Cup tri­umph in 1986.</p>
    <p>It was in Mex­ico where he dis­played his divine ta­lent along with a touch of the devil, scor­ing the in­fa­mous “Hand of God” goal and the “Goal of the Cen­tury”, drib­bling past the Eng­land team en route to net­ting one of the most spec­tac­u­lar strikes in tour­na­ment his­tory.</p>
    <p>His off-field de­mons were never far away, how­ever, with Maradona test­ing pos­i­tive for co­caine while at Napoli, cop­ping a 15-month ban in 1991, while he was also thrown out of the 1994 World Cup in the United States af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for a cock­tail of stim­u­lants.</p>
    <p>He had two daugh­ters with his for­mer wife and six more chil­dren il­le­git­i­mately, and had a peri­patetic coaching ca­reer but his stature i n Ar­gentina re­mains undimmed. He will be only the sec­ond non-pres­i­dent to re­ceive a state fu­neral af­ter For­mula One leg­end Juan Manuel Fan­gio.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said that Maradona was set to be buried yes­ter­day on the out­skirts of Buenos Aires in the Jardin de Paz ceme­tery, where his par­ents also rest.</p>
