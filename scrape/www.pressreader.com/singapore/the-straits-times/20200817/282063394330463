    <p>Clean­ers at malls, food­courts and toi­lets have had to adapt to the more rig­or­ous clean­ing stan­dards since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I feel like our jobs are more val­ued now, be­cause by keep­ing places clean, I’m pro­tect­ing peo­ple from the virus,” said Mr Lim Chye-seng, in his 60s, who has worked as a cleaner at an Or­chard Road mall for a year.</p>
    <p>He said that while the work might be “more stren­u­ous” due to the more fre­quent clean­ing, hav­ing more staff in the team has made his work­load man­age­able.</p>
    <p>But he has had to take on more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, such as clean­ing rail­ings and mak­ing sure floors are mopped and kept clean.</p>
    <p>“I’m look­ing for­ward to maybe learn­ing more tech­nol­ogy, like how to op­er­ate au­to­mated clean­ing sys­tems so I can be more than just a ‘clean­ing un­cle’,” he said.</p>
    <p>Madam Goh Li San, 72, who cleans ta­bles and dishes at a food­court in the west­ern part of Sin­ga­pore, said that while au­to­mated tray re­turn ro­bots that “walk around” the food­court en­cour­age peo­ple to re­turn their trays, a cleaner’s job is not made eas­ier – ta­bles still have to be cleaned as soon as they are va­cated and ex­tra care taken to dis­in­fect sur­faces.</p>
    <p>“We work long shifts and are al­ways on our feet, but I’m not com­plain­ing. I’m lucky to have a job,” said Madam Goh, who has worked at the food­court for two years.</p>
    <p>“Of course, if there are other cute ro­bots who can help us with wash­ing dishes and dis­in­fect­ing ta­bles, I would be very happy to have them as ‘col­leagues’ too.”</p>
