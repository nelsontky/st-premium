    <p>• A cul­ture in gym­nas­tics that has tol­er­ated coaches be­lit­tling, ma­nip­u­lat­ing and, in some cases, phys­i­cally abus­ing young ath­letes, is be­ing chal­lenged by Olympians and other gym­nasts around the world af­ter an up­ris­ing in the United States.</p>
    <p>Many cur­rent and for­mer com­peti­tors, em­bold­ened by their Amer­i­can peers, have bro­ken their si­lence in re­cent weeks against treat­ment they say cre­ated men­tal scars on girls that lasted well into adult­hood.</p>
    <p>At a time when the Tokyo Olympics would be in ses­sion had the event not been post­poned to next year by the Covid-19 pan­demic, gym­nasts have been shar­ing hor­rific sto­ries of coaches body-sham­ing them, sti­fling their emo­tions, us­ing corporal pu­n­ish­ment and forc­ing them to train with in­juries, us­ing the pur­suit of medals to ra­tio­nalise shame­ful be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Chloe Gilliland, 29, a for­mer mem­ber of the Aus­tralian na­tional team, re­called her coaches telling her that she was “a bad child” and “a dan­ger” to her own body be­cause she was too heavy.</p>
    <p>At 17, she thought of killing her­self be­cause, she said on In­sta­gram, “I felt like it was eas­ier to end my own life than to give in to what they wanted me to be.”</p>
    <p>Cather­ine Lyons, 19, once a top ju­nior com­peti­tor for Bri­tain, said coaches would hit her and harass her about her weight, and when she was seven or eight, she would cry so hard that coaches would shut her inside a cup­board un­til she com­posed her­self.</p>
    <p>Later, she said, she learned she had post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der be­cause of the treat­ment.</p>
    <p>She told ITV News: “I wasn’t worth any­thing. I wasn’t a hu­man. I was a com­mod­ity rather than a child.” Other gym­nasts have sim­ply said on so­cial me­dia: “I am one of them.”</p>
    <p>The sto­ries from gym­nasts in all lev­els of the sport are part of a co­or­di­nated ef­fort, sim­i­lar to the #Me­Too move­ment, call­ing for the sport’s lead­ers to erad­i­cate ex­ist­ing norms that are not nor­mal at all.</p>
    <p>“I was told many times that gym­nasts should be seen and not heard be­cause the sport is all about be­ing the good lit­tle gym­nast,” said Lisa Ma­son, a Bri­tish Olympian at the Syd­ney 2000 Games and among the gym­nasts to speak out re­cently.</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old said her coaches threw shoes at her and scratched her when she did not per­form per­fectly. Once she was made to stay on the un­even bars un­til her hands were blis­tered and ripped, only for a coach to pin her hands down and pour rub­bing al­co­hol into her raw wounds, she added.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, Ma­son called the at­mos­phere “in­sane,” es­pe­cially be­cause gym­nasts who start train­ing se­ri­ously at a very young age are of­ten left alone with coaches.</p>
    <p>“So many of us are done with nor­mal­is­ing the abuse that we were told was needed to make cham­pi­ons,” she said. “We want change, and it’s in­cred­i­ble that so many of us are com­ing to­gether to de­mand it.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional gym­nas­tics fed­er­a­tions in Bri­tain, Aus­tralia, the Nether­lands and Bel­gium have be­gun in­ves­ti­ga­tions or re­quested in­quiries into al­leged abuse, with the Dutch fed­er­a­tion say­ing it would sus­pend its women’s na­tional team pro­gramme as it looked for an­swers.</p>
    <p>Bri­ton Jen­nifer Pinches, who com­peted at the Lon­don 2012 Games, said this re­cent global push to change the sport was sparked by Net­flix doc­u­men­tary Ath­lete A. It de­picts the har­row­ing train­ing of Amer­i­can elite gym­nasts and the cover-ups that sur­rounded USA Gym­nas­tics’ sex­ual abuse scan­dal in­volv­ing its long-time team doc­tor, Larry Nas­sar.</p>
    <p>“It was a tip­ping point that en­abled this move­ment to hap­pen,” said Pinches who, af­ter see­ing the film, per­suaded more than 30 Bri­tish gym­nasts, in­clud­ing Ma­son, to post a joint state­ment on so­cial me­dia con­demn­ing “the cul­ture that didn’t put ath­lete health and well-be­ing first and al­lowed Nas­sar to act”. The group used the hash­tag #Gym­nastAl­liance and, since then, there have been more than 700 posts on In­sta­gram alone.</p>
    <p>Back in the United States, Jen­nifer Sey, a 1986 na­tional cham­pion and one of the pro­duc­ers of Ath­lete A, was stunned the film prompted so many ath­letes to come for­ward about their ex­pe­ri­ences, es­pe­cially when ath­letes had so many pre­vi­ous chances to speak up.</p>
    <p>In the last 25 years, there have been sev­eral books about abuse in the sport, in­clud­ing one by Sey in 2008. There also were Nas­sar’s sen­tenc­ing hear­ings in 2018, dur­ing which more than 150 girls and women tes­ti­fied, even­tu­ally lead­ing to his life sen­tence in jail.</p>
    <p>In April, Mag­gie Haney, who coached Olympian Lau­rie Her­nan­dez, was sus­pended for eight years by USA Gym­nas­tics for ver­bally abus­ing and mis­treat­ing ath­letes.</p>
    <p>It was among the first times – if not the first – that a top Amer­i­can coach had been pun­ished for that kind of abuse and gym­nasts are see­ing this year as a per­fect time to bring world­wide change to non­sex­ual abuse in the sport.</p>
    <p>“This time, you can’t say the ac­cu­sa­tions are against just one bad ap­ple, one bad coach or one bad sys­tem, and then dis­miss them,” Sey said. “A lot of these women who came for­ward con­tin­ued to suf­fer be­cause of their coaches’ cruel treat­ment, and they don’t want to suf­fer any more. They don’t want fu­ture gen­er­a­tions to suf­fer, ei­ther.”</p>

    <p>JEN­NIFER SEY, the 1986 US na­tional cham­pion, who was stunned the Net­flix film Ath­lete A prompted so many ath­letes to come for­ward about their ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
