    <p>Con­struc­tion of mul­ti­ple key sports in­fras­truc­ture across Sin­ga­pore has been af­fected by the pan­demic and will likely see more de­lays in the com­ing months, said Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Teck Yin.</p>
    <p>Among them is the mega Kal­lang Alive project that en­com­passes six de­vel­op­ments – the Youth Hub which in­cludes a velo­drome, Kal­lang Foot­ball Hub, Sin­ga­pore Ten­nis Cen­tre, Be­naan Ka­pal Green, Alive Gate­way and Loop and the re­de­vel­op­ment of the Kal­lang Theatre.</p>
    <p>The new precinct, which was in­tended to in­ject vi­brancy into the area, was to have been opened in phases and com­pleted by 2025. SportSG, while de­clin­ing to re­veal the project’s cost, had tar­geted up to 30 mil­lion vis­i­tors an­nu­ally to the area, up from the cur­rent 12 mil­lion, its deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive Chi­ang Hock Woon pre­vi­ously stated.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Sunday Times last week, Lim said the de­lays are “not in­signif­i­cant”. He high­lighted how the short­age of work­ers has meant the Foot­ball Hub, which was sched­uled to open this year, will be ready only in the sec­ond half of next year.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated at the Kal­lang Field, the fa­cil­ity will house the na­tional train­ing cen­tre and Ac­tiveSG Foot­ball Academy.</p>
    <p>An­other project that has been pushed back is Bukit Can­berra, the 12ha in­te­grated sports and com­mu­nity hub in Sem­bawang. Orig­i­nally slated to open pro­gres­sively this year, Lim said this will only be­gin from the mid­dle of 2021.</p>
    <p>Ren­o­va­tions at Choa Chu Kang Sports Cen­tre and Delta Sports Cen­tre are held up, while then Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Grace Fu had said in June the new Pung­gol Re­gional Sports Cen­tre may miss its 2023 open­ing time­line due to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Cy­cling Fed­er­a­tion gen­eral man­ager Mahipal Singh said the as­so­ci­a­tion had con­tin­gen­cies if the velo­drome was de­layed. It was in talks with the Jo­hor Cy­cling Fed­er­a­tion in Jan­uary to use its velo­drome and BMX rac­ing track and is hope­ful of fi­nal­is­ing an ar­range­ment once travel re­stric­tions are eased.</p>
    <p>For SportSG’s Lim, an equally press­ing is­sue is get­ting the na­tion to con­tinue be­ing phys­i­cally ac­tive in this Covid-19 era.</p>
    <p>The lat­est na­tional sports par­tic­i­pa­tion survey noted the num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans who ac­tively par­tic­i­pate in sports rose from 54 per cent in 2015 to 66 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>In the first quar­ter of this year, the fig­ure reached a high of 73 per cent although it dipped dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, which lasted from April 7 to June 1.</p>
    <p>At­ten­dance at pub­lic sports venues – in­clud­ing swim­ming pools, fit­ness gyms, in­door sports halls and sta­di­ums – reached 17.7 mil­lion last year. This will fall by al­most two-thirds to an es­ti­mated 7 mil­lion this year, largely due to ca­pac­ity re­stric­tions for safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Lim is also con­cerned with the lim­ited pro­gramme for next year’s Na­tional School Games (NSG), which was can­celled this year.</p>
    <p>The annual sports com­pe­ti­tion sees about 60,000 stu­dent-ath­letes com­pet­ing across 29 sports.</p>
    <p>Team sports like cricket, foot­ball, hockey, rugby, net­ball, soft­ball, vol­ley­ball and wa­ter polo are ex­cluded from next year’s NSG though the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion is work­ing on how these may ad­here to na­tional guide­lines and re­sume.</p>
    <p>Lim said: “We are in a sense ex­pe­ri­enc­ing this big blip in terms of what we wanted to do... but we have to look at it also from the point of view that there is ev­ery im­pe­tus to think about in­no­vat­ing.</p>
    <p>“We started run­ning the 2v2 bas­ket­ball tour­na­ment (Nov 26-Dec 6) sim­ply to get the mes­sage out there to in­no­vate. If you can only play with eight (in Phase Three), how are you go­ing to play?</p>
    <p>“Change your rules, mod­ify them and get down to play, es­pe­cially for the chil­dren and youth. I don’t think we will lose a gen­er­a­tion but let’s not lose a year or two.”</p>
    <p>He is equally de­ter­mined to en­sure the sur­vival of the lo­cal sports in­dus­try and points to the $50 mil­lion in govern­ment sup­port that has been com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>In June, $25 mil­lion in relief mea­sures was an­nounced through the En­ter­prise In­no­va­tion & Ca­pa­bil­ity Grant, Ac­tive En­abler Pro­gramme, cre­ation of tem­po­rary jobs, Ac­tiveSG Cir­cle, and other dig­i­tal con­tent ini­tia­tives and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties. Four months later, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong said a Sports Re­silience Pack­age of a fur­ther $25 mil­lion will be pumped into the sports sec­tor.</p>
    <p>One crit­i­cal take­away from the Covid-19 cri­sis for Lim has been a more in-depth look at the lo­cal sports ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>There is a large part that is less vis­i­ble but has a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of self-em­ployed per­sons, he noted. These are the small gyms, mar­tial arts schools, gym­nas­tics acad­e­mies that were pre­vi­ously not on SportSG’s radar but do good work and need their sup­port.</p>
    <p>“We are very sen­si­tive to make sure that we don’t lose the ex­pe­ri­ence, knowl­edge and ca­pa­bil­ity in ar­eas that have taken us years and years to build up... We are work­ing very closely to see how we can make sure that they re­main vi­able if they fun­da­men­tally have got a good busi­ness model.”</p>
    <p>With fuller data on the in­dus­try, SportSG is then better equipped to help de­velop the en­tire sec­tor, Lim added.</p>
    <p>While this year’s sports calendar was se­verely re­duced due to the pan­demic, which saw mar­quee events like the For­mula One Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix and In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup foot­ball tour­na­ment be­ing can­celled, there are signs of re­cov­ery on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>Bad­minton’s Sin­ga­pore Open is sched­uled for April 13-18, the Sin­ga­pore Rugby Sev­ens for next Oc­to­ber and the HSBC Women’s World Cham­pi­onship golf event is ex­pected to re­turn next year as well.</p>
    <p>Lim said SportSG is ex­plor­ing how it can of­fer Sin­ga­pore as a stopover for Olympic teams and even position these train­ing camps as events with ex­hi­bi­tion matches against lo­cal teams.</p>
    <p>He added: “We want to con­tinue to push our events calendar be­cause it drives in­no­va­tion and sup­ports the lo­cal in­dus­try. It’s also con­sis­tent with the idea that Sin­ga­pore is open for busi­ness and we can run an event in a safe and con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>Change your rules, mod­ify them and get down to play, es­pe­cially for the chil­dren and youth. I don’t think we will lose a gen­er­a­tion but let’s not lose a year or two.</p>
    <p>LIM TECK YIN, SportSG chief ex­ec­u­tive, on be­ing in­no­va­tive.</p>
    <p>Af­ter stel­lar show­ings at the last three SEA Games, Sin­ga­pore could see a dip in its gold medal haul at next year’s edi­tion in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic has crossed the 50-gold mark at three con­sec­u­tive Games since 2015 – the coun­try’s pre­vi­ous best was 50 when it hosted the 1993 Games – but that se­quence is in dan­ger of end­ing.</p>
    <p>For Sport Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Teck Yin, his main worry is whether the na­tional ath­letes, par­tic­u­larly those in team sports, will be in peak con­di­tion with less than a year be­fore the Nov 21-Dec 2 Hanoi Games.</p>
    <p>While the Repub­lic en­ters Phase 3 to­mor­row and the eas­ing of some mea­sures will kick in, high per­for­mance train­ing will not be in the same form as be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Re­gional ri­vals like Thai­land, In­done­sia, Malaysia and Viet­nam how­ever, are able to take ad­van­tage not only of their ge­o­graph­i­cal size to re­sume train­ing but also their large tal­ent pool to or­gan­ise do­mes­tic events for their ath­letes to com­pete and sharpen their skills.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is there­fore play­ing catch-up, said Lim.</p>
    <p>“So when we think about pro­gres­sion and our high-per­for­mance am­bi­tions, I think they will be af­fected (by Covid-19),” he added. “For some sports more than oth­ers, but in to­tal, it does have an im­pact, es­pe­cially af­ter the break­throughs we’ve made in re­cent ma­jor Games.”</p>
    <p>As hosts in 2015, Sin­ga­pore cap­tured a record 84 golds and was sec­ond in the medal stand­ings be­hind Thai­land (95 golds).</p>
    <p>At the 2017 Kuala Lumpur Games, Sin­ga­pore ended fourth over­all with 58 ti­tles and, two years later in In­done­sia, fin­ished sixth with 53 golds.</p>
    <p>Team sports like floor­ball, soft­ball and un­der­wa­ter hockey con­trib­uted six golds at the 2019</p>
    <p>Games while Sin­ga­pore is tra­di­tion­ally strong in net­ball, wa­ter polo and cricket as well.</p>
    <p>The Viet­nam or­gan­is­ers have re­vealed a pro­gramme of 40 sports which does not fea­ture any of the six above, but the list may still be up­dated as var­i­ous coun­tries lobby for more sports to be in­cluded.</p>
    <p>Swim­mers like Joseph School­ing and Quah Zheng Wen led Sin­ga­pore to 23 golds at the New Clark City Aquat­ics Cen­tre, while the bowlers, fencers and table ten­nis play­ers also chipped in with more sil­ver­ware.</p>
    <p>The bar­ri­ers to train­ing for such in­di­vid­ual sports is less of an is­sue com­pared to team sports, said Lim.</p>
    <p>They will be al­lowed to work in groups of eight when Phase 3 starts but we need them to train more freely, he added. To do this, the na­tional agency must first put into oper­a­tion a work­able test­ing reg­i­men for them and, sub­se­quently, one for vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Lim said a pro­posal that some team sports ath­letes be given the vac­cine ahead of oth­ers is also be­ing dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>Point­ing out how a se­lect group of about 30 ath­letes from 10 sports</p>
    <p>– those who qual­i­fied or were close to qual­i­fy­ing for next year’s Tokyo Olympic and Par­a­lympic Games – were al­lowed to re­sume train­ing “un­der con­trolled con­di­tions” at se­lected venues in June’s Phase 1, he said a sim­i­lar pri­or­ity queue is be­ing ex­plored.</p>
