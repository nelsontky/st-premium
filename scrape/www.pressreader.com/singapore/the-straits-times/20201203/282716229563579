    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic may have forced many of Vi­enna’s lux­ury ho­tels to close in­def­i­nitely as global travel re­stric­tions keep away the many mil­lions of tourists who usu­ally visit the Aus­trian cap­i­tal ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>But the city’s iconic Ho­tel Sacher is de­ter­mined not to let fans of its world-fa­mous choco­late cake go hun­gry.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel’s concierge, Mr Uwe Kotzen­dor­fer, is sell­ing Sacher Torte, as the rich del­i­cacy is known, on a drive-in stand just across the road from Vi­enna’s pres­ti­gious State Opera house.</p>
    <p>“I do a bit of ev­ery­thing now,” says Mr Kotzen­dor­fer, stand­ing next to a small two-wheel cart stacked high with cakes, as he hands an im­pe­rial red bag con­tain­ing one of them to a cus­tomer driv­ing past in his BMW.</p>
    <p>“I thought it was a fan­tas­tic idea,” says another cus­tomer, Ms Clau­dia Bed­nar.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause we can no l onger travel, I am go­ing to send one to my aunt in Ger­many for her 65th wed­ding an­niver­sary,” she says, then pays for the cake, which typ­i­cally costs be­tween €50 (S$81) and €60, with her credit card.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of the Sacher’s staff are now on gov­ern­ment-sub­sidised fur­lough.</p>
    <p>And the rooms and din­ing halls in the six neo­clas­si­cal build­ings – dec­o­rated with au­to­graphed images of pre­vi­ous guests such as Bri­tain’s Prince Charles, Fran­coGer­man film star Romy Sch­nei­der and Amer­i­can opera singer Jessye Nor­man – are de­serted.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the ho­tel in­sists on dis­play­ing fresh flower ar­range­ments in hon­our of the five busi­ness trav­ellers stay­ing there.</p>
    <p>For those parts of the ho­tel not oc­cu­pied, the man­age­ment is tak­ing the op­por­tu­nity to carry out some much-needed main­te­nance, and Mr Kotzen­dor­fer of­ten guides work­men around the de­serted swathes of the build­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to owner and manag­ing di­rec­tor Matthias Win­kler, the Sacher is the last five-star ho­tel in Vi­enna that is still in fam­ily hands.</p>
    <p>But it has sur­vived a num­ber of ex­is­ten­tial crises in the past and even went bank­rupt dur­ing the global eco­nomic cri­sis in 1934.</p>
    <p>“We’ve gone through many tri­als since the cre­ation of the brand and our fam­ily is still plan­ning for the long term”, said Mr Win­kler, who took over the ho­tel from his mother-in-law in 2015.</p>
    <p>The virus-in­duced eco­nomic down­turn is also tak­ing a heavy toll.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional trav­ellers typ­i­cally ac­count for more than 90 per cent of the ho­tel’s an­nual 23,000 overnight stays, with rooms cost­ing be­tween €400 and €2,300 a night in the low sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with the virus lock­downs, that source of in­come has now been all but wiped out.</p>
    <p>Sacher’s cakes, which are shipped and sold across the world, are help­ing to keep the brand alive.</p>
    <p>Al­though com­pe­ti­tion i n the up­scale ho­tel in­dus­try can be ruth­less and in­ter­na­tional brands have larger fi­nan­cial re­sources, Mr Win­kler be­lieves that be­ing fam­ily-run is turn­ing out to be an ad­van­tage dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Here, de­ci­sions are made at a fam­ily meet­ing, with­out tak­ing or­ders from abroad,” he says.</p>
    <p>The Ho­tel Sacher and the Sacher Torte have a long his­tory.</p>
    <p>In 1832, a young pas­try chef called Franz Sacher was work­ing on a new recipe he hoped would be­come all the rage at the Haps­burg’s im­pe­rial court.</p>
    <p>The in­gre­di­ents were whipped cream, a lot of co­coa, jam to add mois­ture and a rich layer of choco­late frosting.</p>
    <p>Forty-four years later, Mr Sacher’s son Ed­uard opened the ho­tel in Vi­enna’s first dis­trict.</p>
    <p>But it was only af­ter Mr Ed­uard Sacher’s death in 1892 that the ho­tel en­joyed its glam­orous hey­day un­der the man­age­ment of Ed­uard’s widow Anna Sacher.</p>
    <p>As one of the first women to be al­lowed to own and run a busi­ness, the vi­sion­ary ma­tri­arch be­came well known for her wit.</p>
    <p>“A part of the his­tory of Aus­tria rests in our hands,” says the ho­tel’s deputy di­rec­tor Doris Sch­warz.</p>
    <p>“More than ever, it is a ques­tion of be­ing up to the task,” she says, stand­ing un­der­neath an im­pos­ing por­trait of Mrs Sacher.</p>
