    <p>• The South Korean gov­ern­ment ramped up ef­forts to end a strike by thou­sands of the coun­try’s doc­tors yes­ter­day, as Seoul took the un­prece­dented step of re­strict­ing eater­ies in the cap­i­tal in a bid to blunt a surge in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry ex­tended a back-to-work or­der for doc­tors to the en­tire coun­try and filed a com­plaint with the po­lice against at least 10 doc­tors it said have not abided by an or­der that has been in place in Seoul since Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The es­ca­la­tion in the dis­pute be­tween doc­tors and the gov­ern­ment comes as South Korean of­fi­cials grap­ple with a fresh wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ag­gres­sive trac­ing and test­ing con­tained a large out­break ear­lier this year, the coun­try suf­fered a set­back this month when a church clus­ter spread to a po­lit­i­cal rally.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials re­ported 371 new in­fec­tions as of mid­night on Thurs­day, bring­ing the coun­try’s to­tal to 19,077, in­clud­ing 316 deaths.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, of­fi­cials fur­ther con­stricted move­ment in the Seoul metropoli­tan area, the cen­tre of the fresh out­break.</p>
    <p>Cof­fee shops, some of which have been iden­ti­fied as hot spots in the out­break, are re­stricted to take­away and de­liv­ery ser­vices. Restau­rants, snack bars and bak­eries are not al­lowed to of­fer on-site din­ing be­tween the hours of 9pm and 5am.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures will last for at least a week.</p>
    <p>Churches, night­clubs and most schools in the cap­i­tal are al­ready closed, and masks are manda­tory in pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun an­nounced that the gov­ern­ment had agreed to ex­tend phase two re­stric­tions – the sec­ond high­est level – across the coun­try for at least an­other week.</p>
    <p>“Phase three so­cial dis­tanc­ing is the choice of last re­sort given the economic and so­cial rip­ple ef­fect,” Mr Chung said dur­ing a gov­ern­ment meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (KCDC) direc­tor Jeong Eun-kyeong warned that mod­el­ling in­di­cates that if the out­break is not con­tained, cases could surge to as many as 2,000 per day.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo said yes­ter­day: “To pro­tect lives and safety of the cit­i­zens in a grave cri­sis of na­tion­wide coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sion, the gov­ern­ment in­evitably ex­panded the back-towork or­der for trainee and pro­fes­sional doc­tors today na­tion­wide.”</p>
    <p>Al­most 16,000 in­tern and res­i­dent doc­tors have been on strike since Aug 21 over the gov­ern­ment’s plans to boost the num­ber of doc­tors in the coun­try over the com­ing decade to bet­ter pre­pare for pub­lic health crises.</p>
    <p>The stu­dent doc­tors, how­ever, ar­gue that ex­tra fund­ing would be bet­ter spent im­prov­ing the salaries of ex­ist­ing trainees, and ad­dress­ing sys­temic is­sues.</p>
    <p>Mean­while South Korea’s Fi­nance Min­is­ter said on Thurs­day that the gov­ern­ment will con­sider draft­ing its fourth sup­ple­men­tary budget of this year should the economic fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic sig­nif­i­cantly worsen.</p>
    <p>If de­ployed, the tough­est stage three so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, where schools and busi­ness are urged to close, would in­flict fur­ther pain on Asia’s fourth-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The fourth ex­tra budget will de­pend on the pace of new coro­n­avirus case in­creases, as well as... whether we raise so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules,” Mr Hong Nam-ki said in a brief­ing, at which re­marks were em­bar­goed till yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A fourth ex­tra budget would bol­ster the 277 tril­lion won (S$318 bil­lion) worth of fis­cal stim­u­lus al­ready pledged by the gov­ern­ment this year to fight the pan­demic.</p>
