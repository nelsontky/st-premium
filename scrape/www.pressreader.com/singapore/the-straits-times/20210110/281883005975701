    <p>A new ini­tia­tive was launched by the Na­tional Kid­ney Foun­da­tion (NKF) yes­ter­day to en­cour­age people to un­der­take projects rais­ing aware­ness of kid­ney health and to re­duce kid­ney-re­lated dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The Kid­ney We Care Move­ment was launched in the light of the ris­ing num­ber of kid­ney fail­ure cases in Singapore, with 5.5 new daily cases need­ing dial­y­sis or kid­ney trans­plant for sur­vival.</p>
    <p>For the past five years, NKF has ad­mit­ted a yearly av­er­age of 855 new dial­y­sis pa­tients, and spent $116 mil­lion in its last fi­nan­cial year to treat kid­ney fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, Singapore has more than 8,000 pa­tients on dial­y­sis, with around two-thirds of them un­der the care of NKF.</p>
    <p>Kid­ney fail­ure is mainly caused by di­a­betes and hyper­ten­sion, and Singapore has one of the high­est rates in the world for di­a­betes-re­lated kid­ney fail­ure.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of di­a­betes cases is pro­jected to grow to one mil­lion by 2050 if more pre­ven­tive mea­sures are not taken.</p>
    <p>Thus, the Kid­ney We Care Move­ment will fo­cus on three aspects: Project 5.5, which will aim to re­duce the num­ber of kid­ney fail­ure cases and re­lated dis­eases like di­a­betes and hyper­ten­sion; Project Hope, which will strengthen psy­cho­log­i­cal and social sup­port for pa­tients and their fam­i­lies; and Project Im­pact, which will ad­vo­cate greater kid­ney health in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>NKF has com­mit­ted $1 mil­lion over the next three years to fund the move­ment, and suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants will re­ceive an in-prin­ci­ple amount of up to $5,500 for each project, or up to 80 per cent of the to­tal al­low­able project cost.</p>
    <p>A com­mit­tee com­pris­ing pro­fes­sion­als from key sec­tors such as health­care, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and fi­nance has been set up to re­view and rec­om­mend pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>Fund­ing is open to Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>NKF chair­man Arthur Lang said: “We be­lieve that this com­mu­nity-driven move­ment will fur­ther pro­pel our ef­forts in in­flu­enc­ing and em­pow­er­ing people to take charge of their kid­ney health, while con­tin­u­ing to help us en­sure the di­verse needs of our pa­tients are well met.”</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive was launched by Min­is­ter of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu, in con­junc­tion with the of­fi­cial open­ing of the NKF’s dial­y­sis cen­tre at Yuhua yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the event, Ms Fu said the funds for the new dial­y­sis cen­tre were raised from in­di­vid­u­als, com­mu­nity part­ners and the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>They were then matched dol­lar for dol­lar by the Govern­ment un­der the Care & Share @ SG50 Move­ment, to­talling up to $2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The new cen­tre is equipped with 21 dial­y­sis sta­tions which can ben­e­fit up to 126 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Fu: “NKF, in part­ner­ship with lo­cal groups in Yuhua, such as the Lov­ing Heart Mul­tiSer­vice Cen­tre and PA grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions, will go up­stream by pro­vid­ing public ed­u­ca­tion on preven­tion and man­age­ment of kid­ney dis­eases.</p>
    <p>“All of this would not have been pos­si­ble with­out the ded­i­ca­tion and un­wa­ver­ing re­solve to im­prove the qual­ity of life for those res­i­dents of Yuhua.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kenny Teo, manag­ing direc­tor of Gain City, do­nated two dial­y­sis ma­chines – one un­der the com­pany’s name, and the other un­der the name of his mother, Madam Lim Meow Ing.</p>
    <p>He told The Sun­day Times in Man­darin that he felt it was a “very mean­ing­ful ini­tia­tive”, and he hoped the open­ing of the new NKF cen­tre will make dial­y­sis more con­ve­nient for pa­tients in the Jurong East area.</p>
