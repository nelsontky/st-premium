    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s ex­ports posted a dou­ble-digit slump for a sixth straight month in Au­gust as United States-bound ship­ments shrank due to a global de­mand slow­down from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, cast­ing a shadow over a trade-led re­cov­ery from the deep re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The ex­port de­cline high­lights the im­mense task Mr Yoshi­hide Suga, who was elected as Ja­pan’s prime min­is­ter yes­ter­day, faces in driv­ing an eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>To­tal ex­ports fell 14.8 per cent year on year last month, a smaller de­cline than the 16.1 per cent ex­pected by econ­o­mists i n a Reuters poll, of­fi­cial data showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>That meant ex­ports fell for their 21st straight month, mark­ing the long­est run of de­clines since a 23-month spell to July 1987 in­clu­sive. That fol­lowed a 19.2 per cent drop in the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>The de­cline last month was driven by fewer ship­ments of cars and min­eral fuels, though the pace of con­trac­tion eased some­what from July as eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity showed signs of pick­ing up.</p>
    <p>“Strong de­mand for in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy linked to work­ing from home re­sulted i n ex­ports of elec­tric ma­chin­ery fall­ing only 5.5 per cent year on year,” said Mr Tom Lear­mouth, Ja­pan econ­o­mist at Cap­i­tal Eco­nomics. “How­ever, ex­port vol­umes may not reach pre-virus lev­els un­til early 2022.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, who won a rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party lead­er­ship elec­tion on Mon­day, will face a huge chal­lenge to get the econ­omy back on track after it posted its worst post-war con­trac­tion in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>By re­gion, ship­ments to the US – Ja­pan’s key mar­ket – fell 21.3 per cent in the year to Au­gust, weighed heav­ily by de­clines in en­gine parts and con­struc­tion ma­chin­ery.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports to China, Ja­pan’s largest trad­ing part­ner, rose 5.1 per cent year on year last month, helped by a sharp jump in semi­con­duc­tor ship­ments, the data showed. That marked the sec­ond straight monthly rise in China-bound ship­ments, which showed signs of pick­ing up, a fi­nance min­istry of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports to t he rest of Asia de­clined 7.8 per cent, weighed down by shrink­ing ex­ports of iron and steel prod­ucts. Over­all im­ports fell 20.8 per cent in the year to last month, ver­sus the me­dian es­ti­mate for an 18 per cent de­crease.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the trade bal­ance came to a sur­plus of 248.3 bil­lion yen (S$3.2 bil­lion), ver­sus the me­dian es­ti­mate for a 37.5 bil­lion yen short­fall.</p>
