    <p>In­done­sia’s top ter­ror­ist con­vict Abu Bakar Bashir, the spir­i­tual leader of South-east Asia’s ter­ror­ist group Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI), was re­leased from pri­son early yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The rad­i­cal cleric, 82, has been in jail since his ar­rest in 2009.</p>
    <p>In 2011, he was sen­tenced to 15 years in pri­son for fund­ing a mil­i­tant train­ing camp in In­done­sia’s west­ern­most prov­ince of Aceh.</p>
    <p>The re­lease comes af­ter the usual re­mis­sion of a sen­tence for rea­sons in­clud­ing ill health. Mr Bashir has chronic ve­nous in­suf­fi­ciency, which usu­ally leads to swelling in the legs.</p>
    <p>Ms Rika Apriyanti, the Law and Hu­man Rights Min­istry spokesman for pris­ons, said that Mr Bashir’s fam­ily and lawyers picked him up at the Gu­nung Sin­dur pri­son in Bo­gor, West Java.</p>
    <p>She said he had tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19, adding that those who met him were re­quired to also show neg­a­tive Covid-19 test re­sults as part of health pro­to­cols in­sti­tuted amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­pa­nied by his sons Ab­dul Rochim and Ab­dul Rosyid, his three lawyers, and a doc­tor from the Med­i­cal Emer­gency Res­cue Com­mit­tee, the cleric left the pri­son af­ter morn­ing prayers and went to the Al-Muk­min Is­lamic board­ing school in Ngruki, Suko­harjo, near the Cen­tral Java city of Solo.</p>
    <p>“There will be no spe­cial event (to wel­come him),” Mr Hasyim Ab­dul­lah, one of the lawyers, told The Straits Times in a text mes­sage.</p>
    <p>Mr Bashir was the al­leged mas­ter­mind be­hind In­done­sia’s dead­li­est ter­ror­ist at­tack – the 2002 bomb­ings on the re­sort is­land of Bali which killed 202 peo­ple. He was never con­victed of the at­tack.</p>
    <p>JI, widely be­lieved to have a link with the Al-Qaeda ter­ror­ist group, was con­sid­ered to be be­hind sev­eral at­tacks, in­clud­ing the JW Mar­riott Ho­tel bomb­ing in Jakarta in 2003 that killed 12 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Re­act­ing to Mr Bashir’s re­lease, Ms Thi­olina Fer­awati Marpaung, a vic­tim of the 2002 Bali bomb­ing, hoped that the au­thor­i­ties would con­tinue to su­per­vise him.</p>
    <p>“His move­ments must be closely watched,” the 47-year old, whose eyes were per­ma­nently da­m­aged by the bomb­ing, told ST over the phone from Den­pasar.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know what he was think­ing while in pri­son, (whether) it is pos­i­tive or neg­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bashir pledged al­le­giance to the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2014 while in pri­son.</p>
    <p>His long his­tory of mil­i­tancy can be traced to the early 1980s, when he was ac­cused of ag­i­tat­ing peo­ple to re­sist the state ide­ol­ogy Pan</p>
    <p>casila, and he was later sen­tenced to nine years in jail.</p>
    <p>In 1985, he man­aged to flee to Malaysia, where he founded JI in the early 1990s.</p>
    <p>He rad­i­calised sev­eral Malaysians, in­clud­ing bomb ex­perts Aza­hari Husin and No­ordin Mo­ham­mad Top. Many Sin­ga­porean JI mem­bers also stud­ied with Mr Bashir at a school in Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2018, Mr Bashir, who is mar­ried and has three chil­dren, was of­fered early re­lease by the gov­ern­ment on hu­man­i­tar­ian grounds due to his de­te­ri­o­rat­ing health. How­ever, it was on the con­di­tion that he had to first pledge al­le­giance to the coun­try and Pan­casila, as is re­quired for all re­formed ter­ror­ists. He re­fused the of­fer.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Counter Ter­ror­ism Agency’s di­rec­tor for law en­force­ment Eddy Hartono said on Thurs­day that the de­rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion of Mr Bashir would con­tinue af­ter his re­lease.</p>
    <p>“We hope Abu Bakar Bashir will de­liver peace­ful and sooth­ing ser­mons,” he was quoted as say­ing by Kom­pas TV.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have also said that they will mon­i­tor his move­ments.</p>
