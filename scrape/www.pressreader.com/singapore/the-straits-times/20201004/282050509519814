    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has wiped out sport­ing events world­wide this year, with week­end war­riors in Sin­ga­pore par­tic­u­larly hard hit by the halt­ing of mass runs which at­tract thou­sands weekly.</p>
    <p>But the flip side is that vir­tual rac­ing has since taken off in a big way, with many land­mark races, such as the an­nual The Straits Times Run, con­vert­ing into the ST Vir­tual Run.</p>
    <p>With the ST Vir­tual Run kick­ing off on Fri­day with the 17.5km race, here’s what you need to know about vir­tual rac­ing:</p>
    <p>WHAT IS A VIR­TUAL RACE?</p>
    <p>A vir­tual race is a race where a run­ner can com­plete a tar­geted dis­tance through run­ning or walk­ing from any­where he wants, with­out the need to gather at a spec­i­fied place and time, un­like con­ven­tional races.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als who are afraid of run­ning or walk­ing with crowds in con­ven­tional races but want to con­trib­ute and be part of this char­ity move­ment, would be able to take this chance.</p>
    <p>WHAT ARE THE AD­VAN­TAGES OF TAK­ING PART IN A VIR­TUAL RACE?</p>
    <p>First, a vir­tual race may serve as mo­ti­va­tion for in­di­vid­u­als to work to­wards a goal (com­plet­ing or achiev­ing a tim­ing for the par­tic­u­lar dis­tance). Non-run­ners can use this as a start­ing point to be­gin their run­ning jour­ney to­wards lead­ing an ac­tive life­style.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, they have the flex­i­bil­ity to start their race-day rou­tine any­where, any time.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants who may feel ner­vous or anx­ious on race day will have the free­dom to clock their mileage when they feel ready within a given pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Run­ners do not have to get up at pre-dawn hours, travel to far­away places or be wor­ried about be­ing late at the start­ing line.</p>
    <p>They also have the lux­ury of avoid­ing the long toi­let queues be­fore a live race.</p>
    <p>Vir­tual races are usu­ally held over a pe­riod of time in­stead of a fixed date. If they are feel­ing un­der the weather or there is a bad weather forecast, they have the op­tion to start their race an­other day within the stip­u­lated pe­riod and com­plete the chal­lenge in the con­di­tions that suit them.</p>
    <p>Third, vir­tual races are cheaper to en­ter than live races.</p>
    <p>WHAT ARE THE DIS­AD­VAN­TAGES OF DO­ING A VIR­TUAL RACE?</p>
    <p>First, there is no ap­pointed fixed route for the tar­geted dis­tance, which means par­tic­i­pants have to plan their own route.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants start­ing out on their run­ning jour­ney may not be fa­mil­iar with the routes avail­able and may end up feel­ing dis­cour­aged.</p>
    <p>For vir­tual races, dis­tance mark­ers are not avail­able as a guide for run­ners with­out GPS watches or those who dis­like car­ry­ing their mo­bile phones with them.</p>
    <p>There are also no wa­ter sta­tions at fixed mark­ers and run­ners have to plan their own wa­ter stops along the route.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, there are no emer­gency ser­vices and am­bu­lance staff on standby along the route.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants may need to plan their run time when there may be some crowds to as­sist in times of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Third, the race ex­pe­ri­ence – from race-pack col­lec­tion to race-day run­ning (com­pet­ing with other rac­ers, hav­ing pac­ers on site, live cheer­ing from friends and fam­ily mem­bers as they race to the fin­ish line), post-race mas­sage, the food and live-mu­sic am­bi­ence – is ab­sent.</p>
    <p>Roads will not be closed for their con­ve­nience. If they want to run with­out dis­rup­tion from traf­fic, they will likely have to run through the city or gar­dens.</p>
    <p>And their race mo­ments – from fun times to epic mo­ments – will not be cap­tured by of­fi­cial race pho­tog­ra­phers.</p>
