    <p>Com­pa­nies will need to pay for­eign pro­fes­sion­als and mid-skilled work­ers higher salaries in or­der for them to qual­ify to work in Sin­ga­pore. The im­pend­ing move to raise the salary thresh­olds for Em­ploy­ment Passes and S Passes comes amid slacker labour mar­ket con­di­tions ow­ing to the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies will need to pay for­eign pro­fes­sion­als and mid-skilled work­ers higher salaries in or­der for them to qual­ify to work in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The im­pend­ing move to raise the salary thresh­olds for Em­ploy­ment Passes (EPs) and S Passes comes amid slacker labour mar­ket con­di­tions ow­ing to the Covid-19 cri­sis, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers and busi­ness groups said it will likely en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to source for more Sin­ga­porean work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo did not give de­tails but these are ex­pected to be made pub­lic soon.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the fixed monthly salary thresh­old for EP hold­ers is at least $3,900 and for S Pass hold­ers, at l east $2,400. The qual­i­fy­ing salaries are higher for older and more ex­pe­ri­enced work­ers.</p>
    <p>The in­crease would be the sec­ond an­nounced this year for EPs, and comes in the wake of ris­ing re­trench­ments and re­cent con­cerns about com­pe­ti­tion be­tween Sin­ga­pore­ans and foreigners in the job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“Even as we stay open to the world to ac­cel­er­ate our re­cov­ery, the cri­sis makes it all the more im­por­tant that em­ploy­ers give fair treat­ment to Sin­ga­pore­ans,” said Mrs Teo, set­ting out her min­istry’s pri­or­i­ties af­ter the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>“We will en­sure that em­ploy­ers up­hold both the let­ter and spirit of the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work. We will closely ex­am­ine re­trench­ment ex­er­cises to en­sure they are car­ried out fairly.”</p>
    <p>She also said that Sin­ga­pore’s for­eign work­force poli­cies are reg­u­larly cal­i­brated for com­pa­nies to have the work­ers they need, while en­sur­ing a strong Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
    <p>To­day, nearly six in 10 lo­cals – that is, Sin­ga­pore­ans plus per­ma­nent res­i­dents – in the work­force are em­ployed in pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) jobs, among the high­est rates in the world, she said.</p>
    <p>And for ev­ery EP holder, there are nearly seven lo­cals em­ployed in PMET roles.</p>
    <p>In May, the EP salary thresh­old was raised to $3,900 for new ap­pli­cants, from $3,600, and renewals will fol­low suit in May next year. Be­fore that, it was last raised in 2017.</p>
    <p>For S Pass hold­ers, the min­i­mum salary was in­creased to $2,400 in Jan­uary, from $2,300 last year and $2,200 in 2018. Be­fore that, it was last raised in 2013.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said busi­nesses that bring in skills that are in short sup­ply or new net­works of op­por­tu­nity for Sin­ga­pore will al­ways be wel­come.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the Gov­ern­ment will re­quire com­pa­nies to do more to de­velop and strengthen their Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam also high­lighted the im­por­tance of a Sin­ga­porean core in the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s (MAS) elab­o­ra­tion on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>He said the cen­tral bank is work­ing with ma­jor fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions (FIs) to en­sure they em­ploy a solid Sin­ga­porean core, in­clud­ing de­vel­op­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans for se­nior roles, com­ple­mented by di­verse and high-qual­ity tal­ent.</p>
    <p>MAS is also work­ing with em­ployer, union and gov­ern­ment part­ners to boost em­ploy­ment, trainee­ships and train­ing in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, un­der a $125 mil­lion sup­port pack­age launched by MAS in April, there will be struc­tured tal­ent de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes for more than 900 Sin­ga­pore­ans among those newly hired by FIs in the next three years, said Mr Thar­man, who is MAS chair­man and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>He noted that the fi­nan­cial sec­tor is on track to meet the tar­gets in its in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion map for 2016 to this year.</p>
    <p>The road map’s tar­get is for the fi­nan­cial ser­vices in­dus­try to cre­ate 3,000 net jobs and a fur­ther 1,000 in fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy an­nu­ally, and grow by 4.3 per cent per year on a real value-added ba­sis.</p>
    <p>MAS is also work­ing with the In­sti­tute of Bank­ing and Fi­nance and Work­force Sin­ga­pore to train and re­de­ploy lo­cal mid-ca­reer work­ers into FIs, said Mr Thar­man.</p>
    <p>“The fi­nan­cial sec­tor re­mains in­te­gral to Sin­ga­pore’s re­cov­ery from the Covid-19 cri­sis and longer-term growth,” he said.</p>
    <p>“MAS will work with the in­dus­try to en­sure that the fi­nan­cial sec­tor is well-equipped with the skills and ca­pa­bil­i­ties to emerge stronger from the cri­sis, and ad­vance Sin­ga­pore as a global fi­nan­cial cen­tre,” he added.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore to grow, it needs to re­open its econ­omy safely and sus­tain­ably, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This re­quires busi­nesses to re­sume their op­er­a­tions pro­gres­sively, with tight safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place for higher-risk ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We will ex­pand our test­ing and con­tact trac­ing ca­pac­ity sig­nif­i­cantly, so that we can iso­late clus­ters swiftly and ef­fec­tively, to al­low the rest of the econ­omy to con­tinue op­er­at­ing,” Mr Chan said in the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try’s (MTI) Ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>MTI will also fa­cil­i­tate safe busi­ness travel, both short- and longterm, with a view to even­tu­ally re­sum­ing in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>It is one way to help busi­nesses and work­ers tap global op­por­tu­ni­ties and cre­ate good jobs, he added.</p>
    <p>MTI is among five min­istries and agen­cies that re­leased their Ad­denda yes­ter­day. The oth­ers are the Min­istry of Man­power, Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The theme for their Ad­denda is</p>
    <p>Sec­tors that have changed per­ma­nently, like mass mar­ket tourism, will get sup­port to pivot to new mar­kets and prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“weath­er­ing the storm and seiz­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties to trans­form our econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>MTI’s Ad­den­dum, which sets out a slew of its pri­or­i­ties in the new term of gov­ern­ment, also pointed to an­other ma­jor move that Sin­ga­pore needs to un­der­take: bol­ster­ing its con­nec­tiv­ity and hub sta­tus.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes build­ing up links with the world for mar­kets, sup­plies, tech­nol­ogy and tal­ent.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, MTI will work with like-minded part­ners to reaf­firm a shared com­mit­ment to keep­ing trade routes open and en­sur­ing the con­tin­ued flow of goods be­tween coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“We will de­velop multi-modal trans­port so­lu­tions to of­fer new com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages to traders and lo­gis­tics play­ers us­ing Sin­ga­pore as a hub,” Mr Chan added.</p>
    <p>“This im­proved con­nec­tiv­ity will also en­able com­pa­nies to di­ver­sify their sup­ply sources and reach more cus­tomers more read­ily, in­creas­ing their re­silience against the risk of sup­ply chain dis­rup­tion.”</p>
    <p>Trade in the dig­i­tal econ­omy will also get a boost through dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ments.</p>
    <p>These agree­ments pro­vide ease and cer­tainty to com­pa­nies, and can bet­ter en­able tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies to use Sin­ga­pore as the lo­ca­tion for man­ag­ing their global plat­forms and dig­i­tal ser­vices, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan as­sured Sin­ga­pore­ans and busi­nesses of the Gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment to cre­at­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for them, by help­ing them adapt to a chang­ing world econ­omy.</p>
    <p>MTI will work through in­ter­me­di­aries such as trade as­so­ci­a­tions and cham­bers, SME Cen­tres and the Heart­land En­ter­prise Cen­tre to help busi­nesses grow, trans­form and in­ter­na­tion­alise.</p>
    <p>For sec­tors that con­tinue to see growth op­por­tu­ni­ties, such as bio­med­i­cal sciences, elec­tron­ics, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and the dig­i­tal econ­omy, the min­istry will help them in­vest and ex­pand.</p>
    <p>For those that suf­fered a plunge in de­mand but will even­tu­ally re­cover, such as the aero­space, and ma­rine and off­shore sec­tors, their core ca­pa­bil­i­ties will be pre­served so that they can re­main com­pet­i­tive and re­cover quickly from the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We will chan­nel sup­port to help com­pa­nies in these sec­tors gen­er­ate fresh rev­enue and be­come more cost-ef­fi­cient,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>For sec­tors that have changed per­ma­nently, in­clud­ing mass mar­ket tourism and so­cial en­ter­tain­ment, sup­port will be avail­able for them to pivot to new mar­kets and prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>But he cau­tioned that not all busi­nesses and jobs can be saved, and added that those who are re­trenched will re­ceive help to de­velop new skills and find new jobs.</p>
    <p>“We are con­fronting this cri­sis from a po­si­tion of strength. Our hard-won rep­u­ta­tion for trans­parency, rule of law, skilled work­force and world-class con­nec­tiv­ity are sig­nif­i­cant ad­van­tages, and will en­able us to adapt to the chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>BOL­STER­ING CON­NEC­TIV­ITY</p>
    <p>We will de­velop multi-modal trans­port so­lu­tions to of­fer new com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages to traders and lo­gis­tics play­ers us­ing Sin­ga­pore ’’ as a hub.</p>
