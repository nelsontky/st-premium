    <p>NEW ZEALAND • Dur­ing the early months of pan­demic iso­la­tion, there were few dis­trac­tions as cathar­tic and cheer­ing as the Cul­ture Dance challenge on Tik­Tok, set to the squelchy, lop­ing Laxed (Siren Beat) by Jawsh 685.</p>
    <p>The chore­og­ra­phy that be­came as­so­ci­ated with it was, by Tik­Tok stan­dards, ele­men­tary – a ca­sual sem­a­phore of joy with a mild wig­gle of the waist. Al­most any­one could par­tic­i­pate, and par­tic­i­pate they did.</p>
    <p>In thou­sands of videos, peo­ple did the dance and showed off cloth­ing par­tic­u­lar to their her­itage – Korean, Nige­rian, Ukrainian, French, Brazil­ian and so many more. It was a 10-sec­onds-at-a-time Olympics open­ing cer­e­mony, a dig­i­tal treaty of global harmony.</p>
    <p>Even in its most gen­er­a­tive and en­thu­si­as­tic mo­ments, so­cial me­dia rarely feels like a truly uni­fy­ing force. But scrolling through the videos was a gen­uine tonic, a lit­tle flicker of hope for com­mon lan­guage and un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>While his song was sound­track­ing a world­wide feel-good ses­sion, Jawsh 685 was at home in Ma­nurewa, a neigh­bour­hood in South Auck­land, New Zealand, fin­ish­ing his se­nior year of high school from home, a pro­ducer stuck in his bed­room.</p>
    <p>“One of my friends heard it and was like, ‘I’m pretty sure this is your beat’,” Jawsh, 17, said in an in­ter­view last month con­ducted over Zoom, a bunk bed he shared with his younger brother vis­i­ble in the back­ground. He wore a hoodie ad­ver­tis­ing his crew, Loud And Sty­lah, with the name stylised in Old English font.</p>
    <p>He had been post­ing his songs to YouTube, but, un­known to him, some­one had edited Laxed down to a catchy snip­pet and Tik­Tok lit the match.</p>
    <p>Not long after, Amer­i­can singer Ja­son Derulo recorded a ver­sion with lyrics, and after some be­hindthe-scenes back and forth, an of­fi­cial ver­sion of that song, now ti­tled Sav­age Love (Laxed – Siren Beat), went on to be­come a global smash, top­ping charts in New Zealand, Aus­tralia, Canada, Bri­tain and more. It now sits at No. 9 on the Bill­board Hot 100.</p>
    <p>Laxed, short for re­laxed, is both modern and tra­di­tional – the pac­ing and melody are in­debted to Poly­ne­sian mu­sic and clas­sic reg­gae. But its tex­ture is specif­i­cally of the mo­ment – each note sounds as if it had been sucked through a glitchy vor­tex and spit back out. Which in a way, they had been.</p>
    <p>Laxed was also an ar­rival on the world stage for siren jams – an emer­gent scene filled with pro­duc­ers spe­cial­is­ing in mu­sic suited for blast­ing through sirens at­tached to the front of cars and bi­cy­cles. It is a re­cent youth cul­ture phe­nom­e­non in Pa­cific Is­lan­der, or Pasi­fika, com­mu­ni­ties in New Zealand and sur­round­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“My siren jam is some­how the most known ever now,” Jawsh said in­cred­u­lously. And Sav­age Love has be­come per­haps the big­gest global hit to emerge from a Pasi­fika act since OMC’s wry 1995 lounge-rock smash How Bizarre.</p>
    <p>Jawsh 685 – born Joshua Nanai – is the third old­est of four chil­dren born to a fa­ther from Samoa and a mother from the Cook Is­lands who met in New Zealand. The num­ber 685 is the coun­try code for Samoa, though Jawsh has never been there.</p>
    <p>Ma­nurewa has been a mag­net for Pasi­fika com­mu­ni­ties for decades. “A lot of peo­ple like to talk down on where I’m from,” Jawsh said. “It’s not as bad as what peo­ple say.”</p>
    <p>His par­ents lis­tened to “old is­land mu­sic”, Elvis Pres­ley, Brit­ney Spears and Mariah Carey. But he lis­tened pri­mar­ily to siren jams on YouTube, where a few chan­nels spe­cialise in post­ing the lat­est ones, all pro­duced and re­leased in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>When he de­cided he wanted to make them him­self, he reached out to the one pro­ducer he was ac­quainted with, who would not give up all the secrets. So Jawsh set out to teach him­self.</p>
    <p>Work­ing on a bro­ken lap­top and us­ing the ubiq­ui­tous pro­duc­tion pro­gram FL Stu­dio, Jawsh said he made the orig­i­nal Laxed beat in about four hours. Un­like many tra­di­tional pop or hip-hop pro­duc­ers, who might pri­mar­ily fo­cus on the beat and leave the song­writ­ing to oth­ers, he in­cluded melodic top lines in his pro­duc­tion. In essence, he had laid out a blue­print for a singer to pick up on and add to, which is ex­actly what Derulo did.</p>
    <p>Over the course of this year, Derulo, an early 2010s pop-R&B star, had be­come some­thing of a Tik­Tok phe­nom­e­non, mi­cro-at­tuned to the app’s trends. In May, after Jawsh’s song had be­come a Tik­Tok sta­ple, Derulo put lyrics to it – call­ing his ver­sion Sav­age Love – even though he and Jawsh had not yet come to a for­mal ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, rep­re­sen­ta­tives for the two artists ironed out a deal to prop­erly re­lease the song with Jawsh as the pri­mary artist and Derulo the fea­tured guest.</p>
    <p>And yet Jawsh still faced a strug­gle par­tic­u­lar to sud­den fame in the Tik­Tok era – peo­ple loved his song, but had no idea who he was.</p>
    <p>On Tik­Tok, “what you have is peo­ple con­sum­ing a sound, not really an artist”, said Ms Erika Al­fred­son, Columbia’s se­nior vice-pres­i­dent for mar­ket­ing. “Jawsh’s piece of the song is the beat that every­body fell in love with around the world,” she added, em­pha­sis­ing that “you have to make peo­ple at­tach” for him to es­cape the app’s grav­i­ta­tional pull.</p>
    <p>His ca­reer is be­ing built slowly, one piece at a time.</p>
    <p>K-pop idols BTS will ap­pear on a remix of Sav­age Love, ar­riv­ing on Fri­day. Jawsh has re­leased a se­cond sin­gle, Sweet & Sour, which fea­tures vo­cals from Lauv and Tyga, artists who, like Derulo, Jawsh has never met.</p>
    <p>His sud­den suc­cess has also helped his fam­ily – by the time of a se­cond in­ter­view late last month, his fam­ily had moved to a big­ger home, where he fi­nally had his own bed­room.</p>
