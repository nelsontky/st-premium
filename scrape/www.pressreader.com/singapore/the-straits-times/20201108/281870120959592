    <p>The father of an eight-year-old girl, who was in­jured in a Wood­lands car crash and re­cently woke up from a coma, has do­nated money he re­ceived from well-mean­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to the fam­ily of an­other ac­ci­dent vic­tim.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Tan, 45, re­ceived an out­pour­ing of do­na­tions to cover med­i­cal ex­penses for his daugh­ter Love­lynn, who was flung out of a van in a road ac­ci­dent last month.</p>
    <p>The girl woke up on Tues­day after 11 days in a coma. She is warded at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal, where Mr Tan and his wife have been keep­ing vigil.</p>
    <p>Love­lynn was one of four peo­ple in­jured in the ac­ci­dent in­volv­ing a van, driven by her un­cle, and a red Audi car in Wood­lands Av­enue 12, just after 8pm on Oct 23. She had a head in­jury, broke both legs and needed emer­gency surgery.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese daily Lianhe Wan­bao, Mr Tan, while wor­ry­ing about Love­lynn, came across an­other news ar­ti­cle about 15-year-old Crest Se­condary School stu­dent Huang Jun­y­ong, who died from in­juries after get­ting hit by a car while cross­ing the road in Queensway on Oct 27.</p>
    <p>The boy’s mother, Ms Chen, a 40-year-old cashier, is a sin­gle mother who raised Jun­y­ong and his older brother.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said: “Our chil­dren have all ex­pe­ri­enced se­ri­ous car ac­ci­dents, but my daugh­ter is more for­tu­nate and has re­ceived care and help from many peo­ple. After see­ing Ms Chen’s news, I de­cided to give part of the do­na­tion (to her fam­ily) in my daugh­ter’s name.”</p>
    <p>He did not dis­close the amount he gave.</p>
    <p>In an up­date on Face­book on Thurs­day, Mr Tan said Love­lynn was on the long road to re­cov­ery as she had sus­tained mul­ti­ple in­juries.</p>
    <p>She is awake but in an “un­com­mu­nica­tive state”, he said, adding that the doc­tor said her mem­ory and brain-re­spon­sive sys­tem were af­fected by a blood clot.</p>
    <p>She will have casts for about 15 weeks, and her legs “may take as long as three to six months to fully heal”, he said. “In ad­di­tion, she was un­able to swal­low and has to re­ceive nu­tri­tion through a feed­ing tube for an es­ti­mated 12 weeks.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who works in the trans­port sec­tor, said on Wed­nes­day that he would be de­ac­ti­vat­ing his PayNow ac­count to stop ac­cept­ing do­na­tions. He did not re­veal how much had been col­lected.</p>
    <p>Thank­ing his friends, pri­vate or­gan­i­sa­tions, tem­ples and mem­bers of the pub­lic for their con­tri­bu­tions, he said: “Ev­ery do­na­tion is care­fully recorded and listed to en­sure that it will be used for Love­lynn’s hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion bills and treat­ment costs. The re­main­ing do­na­tions will be given to char­i­ties, in my daugh­ter’s name. I wish to spread the love and con­tinue to pass this on to those in need.”</p>
