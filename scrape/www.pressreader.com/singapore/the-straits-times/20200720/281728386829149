    <p>When Mr Ad­witiya Mal’s fa­ther-in­law was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 at a hos­pi­tal in Delhi, doc­tors ad­vised plasma ther­apy, given his wors­en­ing con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>A “roller coaster of emo­tions” en­sued for the fam­ily as they be­gan a search for a po­ten­tial donor. So­cial me­dia cir­cles as well as net­works of friends and rel­a­tives were ac­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Two women came for­ward, but were in­el­i­gi­ble as they had con­ceived ear­lier; women de­velop an­ti­bod­ies dur­ing preg­nancy that raise the risk of a rare but po­ten­tially fatal trans­fu­sion re­ac­tion lead­ing to lung dam­age in the plasma re­cip­i­ent.</p>
    <p>An­other per­son, who flatly asked for 30,000 ru­pees (S$556), never showed up.</p>
    <p>Mr Mal’s fam­ily was for­tu­nate: a man who had of­fered to do­nate his plasma ear­lier turned out to be a suc­cess­ful match.</p>
    <p>But for many other fam­i­lies in In­dia des­per­ate for any­thing that could save their loved ones, of­fer­ing money is the only way to ac­cess blood plasma. Prices can range from 20,000 to around 300,000 ru­pees per do­na­tion, with a higher pre­mium for rarer blood groups.</p>
    <p>In plasma ther­apy for Covid-19 – which re­mains in a trial stage – a pa­tient who has re­cov­ered from and has an­ti­bod­ies against the virus pro­vides blood plasma to pa­tients with the same blood group, to help speed up the lat­ter’s re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Po­ten­tial healthy donors can do­nate plasma after 14 days of re­cov­ery if they do not show any symp­toms of Covid-19 and if they have the re­quired level of an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Nearly two-thirds of In­dia’s cur­rent tally of over a mil­lion cases have re­cov­ered, but a lack of will­ing donors and a late start to set up au­tho­rised plasma bank­ing cen­tres have led to a flour­ish­ing black mar­ket for this “liq­uid gold”.</p>
    <p>Mr Akhil En­nam­setty, a lawyer from Waran­gal in Te­lan­gana who has do­nated plasma twice, set up an on­line group last month to help con­nect plasma donors and seek­ers. He has en­coun­tered sev­eral mid­dle­men rep­re­sent­ing fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“They of­fer to pay money for any po­ten­tial donor. The amount varies based on var­i­ous fac­tors like de­mand and rareness of a par­tic­u­lar blood group,” he told The Straits Times. “Many gen­uine donors I have been touch with have also said they are get­ting di­rect calls from these mid­dle­men.”</p>
    <p>This black mar­ket ex­ists in spite of le­gal pro­vi­sions in In­dia that pro­scribe such prac­tices. A 1996 or­der from the Supreme Court out­laws paid donors and un­li­censed blood banks. The Na­tional Blood Pol­icy, drafted in 2007, also pro­hibits the sale and trade of blood.</p>
    <p>Dhoond, an on­line ini­tia­tive that Mr Mal co-founded in June to link donors and re­cip­i­ents, has a data­base of around 300 donors. But it has 10 seek­ers for ev­ery one donor on its plat­form. This dearth, he said, was be­cause many re­cov­ered pa­tients were too weak to do­nate.</p>
    <p>“Not only are they weak phys­i­cally, they are also trau­ma­tised men­tally. They have come back from the jaws of death and are be­ing asked to again re­turn to a po­ten­tially high­risk area, a hos­pi­tal, to do­nate,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“There are some who be­lieve that they would rather save their an­ti­bod­ies for a fam­ily mem­ber than some­one un­known,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dhoond has black­listed t wo donors so far for ask­ing money from re­cip­i­ent fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Since the coun­try’s first plasma bank came up in Delhi on July 2, var­i­ous state gov­ern­ments have set up sim­i­lar banks to reg­u­late the do­na­tion of blood plasma.</p>
    <p>The Delhi gov­ern­ment opened its sec­ond plasma bank last Tues­day at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hos­pi­tal, which is the city’s big­gest gov­ern­ment fa­cil­ity ded­i­cated to Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Dr Suresh Ku­mar, the med­i­cal di­rec­tor of the hos­pi­tal, said it man­aged to draw in 11 donors in its first two days of oper­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“If we con­tact 10 pa­tients, one or two are ready to do­nate. Peo­ple have the mis­con­cep­tion that do­nat­ing plasma can cause in­jury or weak­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>A pe­ti­tion was filed this month in the Delhi High Court seek­ing the cre­ation of a statu­tory body to make it manda­tory for hos­pi­tals to ob­tain plasma from their pa­tients who re­cover sub­se­quently.</p>
    <p>Be­sides pos­i­tive in­cen­tives, rec­om­men­da­tions to bring in more donors in­clude mak­ing the process of do­nat­ing safer and eas­ier. “One way to do this would be to set up plasma do­na­tion cen­tres that are in­de­pen­dent of hos­pi­tals, to re­duce the fear of ex­po­sure to a po­ten­tial sec­ond coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion,” said Mr En­nam­setty.</p>
    <p>Re­cent re­search has shown that peo­ple who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 may lose their im­mu­nity to the disease within a few months, leav­ing them vul­ner­a­ble to be­com­ing re­in­fected.</p>
