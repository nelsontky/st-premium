    <p>With its clang­ing cast iron and steel ma­chin­ery, and with “press” in its name, some have mis­taken The Gen­tle­men’s Press for a laun­dro­mat.</p>
    <p>But the let­ter­press and print­ing stu­dio in Gent­ing Lane is the an­tithe­sis to clean clothes, with its seven ink-stained print­ing presses – one of which is over 100 years old.</p>
    <p>Let­ter­press print­ing is the metic­u­lous art of tak­ing a block of let­ters and then us­ing them to stamp ink onto a piece of pa­per to trans­fer the text or im­age.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nat­ing in the 14th cen­tury, let­ter­press print­ing re­mained the pri­mary method of print­ing and dis­tribut­ing in­for­ma­tion un­til the 20th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple see man­ual print­ing as im­per­fec­tion, but to me it’s nice to see that none of them is the same,” says founder Michelle Yu, 31, who ma­jored in il­lus­tra­tion in Te­masek Polytech­nic. “It’s unique... you can call each print a lim­ited-edi­tion run.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a trip to Brook­lyn, New York, in 2011 where she at­tended a work­shop at The Arm Let­ter­press stu­dio, Ms Yu re­turned to Sin­ga­pore de­ter­mined to open her own stu­dio cel­e­brat­ing the ana­logue art form.</p>
    <p>Com­pared to a dig­i­tal print, she ap­pre­ci­ates “the tac­til­ity of pa­per, the colour of the inks, the vi­brancy is just very dif­fer­ent – there’s life in it”.</p>
    <p>The pur­chase that started it all for her was a 120-year-old vin­tage let­ter­press ma­chine from Amer­i­can print­ing press com­pany Chan­dler & Price that she found on eBay.</p>
    <p>“The Amer­i­can owner, who wanted to get rid of it, had it in his garage for a very long time, and it was passed down to him from his grand­fa­ther,” she says.</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing about a tonne, it has moved with her from her first work space in a shop­house in Neil Road, to her cur­rent 1,600 sq ft stu­dio in an in­dus­trial com­plex near Po­tong Pasir.</p>
    <p>“I think vin­tage things have more mean­ing to them – they’ve al­ready lasted through a long pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>“It takes a lot of heart to keep it in good con­di­tion... so far it hasn’t bro­ken down or given me any is­sues,” adds Ms Yu, who greases the press once a month.</p>
    <p>Some of her ma­chines were given to her by prin­ters who have re­tired, while oth­ers are more re­cent pur­chases.</p>
    <p>She uses them to make be­spoke prints of any­thing pa­per-based, be it wed­ding in­vi­ta­tions or name cards, even the oc­ca­sional music vinyl cover and band poster.</p>
    <p>Each print job usu­ally takes about two weeks. After finalising the de­sign, it is cast on pho­topoly­mer plates.</p>
    <p>Colours for the print run are also con­firmed – some­times they are mixed from scratch from Pan­tone colour codes. The plates are set in the print­ing press and pa­pers are pre­pared.</p>
    <p>Let­ter­press is done one painstak­ing colour at a time. Some­times, a client will re­quire a “press check” to see if the in­den­ta­tion and colour are right, be­fore pro­ceed­ing with the print.</p>
    <p>Ms Yu now leads a team of four, who as­sist her with print­ing, de­sign and ad­min­is­tra­tive work.</p>
    <p>Though the work is time con­sum­ing, she feels it is worth the ef­fort. “Imag­ine you’ve spent two weeks work­ing on a piece, and then you send it to a dig­i­tal printer and get it done in two sec­onds, ver­sus an­other two weeks’ work on a let­ter­press printer,” she says.</p>
    <p>“As a de­signer or il­lus­tra­tor my­self, I would want the clients to feel like their work is be­ing treated with re­spect.”</p>
    <p>The video is part of Made In Sin­ga­pore, a se­ries of videos pro­duced by Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings in part­ner­ship with the In­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions Me­dia Devel­op­ment Author­ity (IMDA), as part of IMDA’s Pub­lic Ser­vice Broad­cast ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond sea­son of Made In Sin­ga­pore cel­e­brates the en­tre­pre­neur­ial spirit of Sin­ga­pore­ans who de­sign and hand­craft goods, mak­ing a busi­ness out of what they love.</p>
