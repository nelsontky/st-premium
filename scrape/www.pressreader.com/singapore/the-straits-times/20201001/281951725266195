    <p>• A woman hold­ing a ban­ner read­ing “We are all fash­ion vic­tims” in­fil­trated the cat­walk at Chris­tian Dior’s show dur­ing Paris Fash­ion Week in the French cap­i­tal on Tues­day – walk­ing the run­way so calmly that it ap­peared at first to be part of the event.</p>
    <p>The pro­tester was act­ing in the name of Ex­tinc­tion Re­bel­lion, an ac­tivist move­ment that aims to high­light the risks posed by cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>The act was meant to de­nounce “the im­pact of the fash­ion in­dus­try on the en­vi­ron­ment and so­ci­ety”, a spokesman for the move­ment in France said.</p>
    <p>Strolling past guests, in­clud­ing Game Of Thrones ac­tress Maisie Wil­liams and the bil­lion­aire boss of Dior par­ent LVMH Bernard Ar­nault in the front row, the woman walked to­wards pho­tog­ra­phers af­ter mod­els had ex­ited the run­way.</p>
    <p>She left the scene with­out any­one chal­leng­ing her and leav­ing some peo­ple con­fused over whether it was a stunt or part of the show.</p>
    <p>Dior’s wom­enswear col­lec­tions are de­signed by Ms Maria Grazia Chi­uri, who has of­ten in­tro­duced lo­gos into her col­lec­tions as well as fem­i­nist state­ments on T-shirts and on set.</p>
    <p>Dior de­clined to com­ment fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Ex­tinc­tion Re­bel­lion, which has led protests at Lon­don’s Fash­ion Week since Fe­bru­ary last year, started a cam­paign this week high­light­ing the waste gen­er­ated by the in­dus­try.</p>
