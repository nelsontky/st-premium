    <p>When Mr Kr­ish­nan Har­i­ha­ra­sud­han’s em­ployer in Sin­ga­pore lost its 40-year-long con­tract with an en­gine oil man­u­fac­turer in April, 110 em­ploy­ees, i nclud­ing him, were laid off.</p>
    <p>Un­like his col­leagues, Mr Hari was lucky to re­ceive a new job of­fer while in Sin­ga­pore, but he said his old com­pany re­fused to trans­fer his work per­mit.</p>
    <p>On Aug 11, the firm put him on a repa­tri­a­tion flight back home to Chennai in Tamil Nadu, In­dia.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t want to go home be­cause the salaries here are a third of what I used to get.</p>
    <p>“I would have pre­ferred to stay in Sin­ga­pore, look for a job, and di­rectly trans­fer my work per­mit to a new em­ployer,” said the 29-year-old, who had worked as a su­per­vis­ing man­ager earn­ing about $1,200 a month.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers like Mr Hari who have lost jobs are torn be­tween stay­ing on to look for work and re­turn­ing to their home coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially fear­ing death and ill­ness amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, thou­sands of mi­grants flew back home.</p>
    <p>The High Com­mis­sion of In­dia in Sin­ga­pore said 17,000 Indians have been evac­u­ated on 115 flights, most of them trav­el­ling to the cities of Tiruchi­rap­palli, Coim­bat­ore, Madu­rai and Chennai in Tamil Nadu i n the past five months.</p>
    <p>The High Com­mis­sion said 15,000 now await travel and that new reg­is­tra­tions are tak­ing place ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>But as In­dia and Bangladesh strug­gle with crash­ing economies and un­prece­dented un­em­ploy­ment, most ex­pa­tri­ate work­ers are re­luc­tant to leave their host coun­tries, and those al­ready home are ea­ger to go back abroad.</p>
    <p>About 300,000 of 2.5 mil­lion Tamils work­ing in dif­fer­ent coun­tries have come back to Tamil Nadu in five months.</p>
    <p>In Ker­ala, an­other ma­jor sender of mi­grants, only 254,000 ex­pats have re­turned, out of about 500,000 who had orig­i­nally reg­is­tered for repa­tri­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr S. Iru­daya Ra­jan, a mi­gra­tion ex­pert at the Cen­tre for Devel­op­ment Stud­ies and a mem­ber of the Ker­ala task force for ex­pats, said: “We ex­pect more to come home un­til De­cem­ber, but many who re­turned in panic of Covid-19 are al­ready re­gret­ting it.</p>
    <p>“With no great liveli­hood in their home towns, re­turnees are spend­ing their sav­ings. There is a great clam­our to go back abroad.”</p>
    <p>Jobs are scarce in In­dia – the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct con­tracted a record 23.9 per cent be­tween April and June, and at least 19 mil­lion have lost salaried for­mal econ­omy jobs af­ter the lock­down.</p>
    <p>Mr Raj S, a 45-year-old con­struc­tion ma­chine op­er­a­tor who worked in Sin­ga­pore for 14 years and re­turned to Tiru­pat­tur i n Tamil Nadu in July, now says his farm in­come at home is poor, and debts are mount­ing.</p>
    <p>“I left be­cause I was very afraid I’ll get Covid in the dor­mi­to­ries, but I have to go back some­how,” he said.</p>
    <p>He had spent 15 days in quar­an­tine in Sin­ga­pore be­fore leav­ing, and seven days af­ter land­ing in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing abroad is com­pli­cated and ex­pen­sive. Few work­ers can af­ford to pay re­cruit­ment fees to agen­cies again.</p>
    <p>For Mr Hari, even with a job, he said, he will have to pay $150 for a flight, about $300 for pa­per­work, and at least $200 for Covid-19 swab tests and quar­an­tine when he gets to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing trav­ellers have to pay for their tests.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the bor­ders in Sin­ga­pore re­main closed to trav­ellers ex­cept for safe travel pass hold­ers from South Korea, Brunei, China, Malaysia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>DIS­CRIM­I­NA­TION AT HOME</p>
    <p>Many mi­grants laid off be­cause of the pan­demic-as­so­ci­ated down­turn, and who are now back home, ex­pe­ri­ence shame and im­pov­er­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>Some even face dis­crim­i­na­tion from lo­cals be­cause of the fear that they could be car­ry­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Ship­yard me­chanic Anisur Rah­man, who worked in Sin­ga­pore for eight years, went home to Bangladesh’s Tan­gail dis­trict on Feb 26 on what was meant to be a month-long hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic struck and the 42-year-old was not able to fly back to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He waited to re­join work at his em­ployer’s re­quest, but did not hear from them.</p>
    <p>Last month, he found out from the Min­istry of Man­power’s web­site – his em­ployer did not in­form him – that his work per­mit had been can­celled, leav­ing him with­out a job.</p>
    <p>“I had hoped to re­turn but now I will have to find some work here in my coun­try,” a de­jected Mr Rah­man said. “I even used up what­ever I had saved.”</p>
    <p>More than 95,000 Bangladesh­i work­ers have re­turned home from dif­fer­ent coun­tries since April af­ter los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>One of them is 42-year-old Iqbal Hos­sain, who worked as a tailor in Kuwait.</p>
    <p>His res­i­dency per­mit ex­pired in Jan­uary but his em­ployer did not ap­ply to re­new it.</p>
    <p>Mr Hos­sain then spent sev­eral weeks un­der a strict lock­down and 20 days in a gov­ern­ment camp for those with­out res­i­dency per­mits.</p>
    <p>He even­tu­ally re­turned to Bangladesh i n May un­der an amnesty scheme.</p>
    <p>“I have been strug­gling since, sur­viv­ing on money bor­rowed from oth­ers,” he said, adding that ac­cess­ing a gov­ern­ment fi­nan­cial sup­port scheme aimed at mi­grants like him has been dif­fi­cult be­cause of ex­ten­sive pa­per­work.</p>
    <p>He added that he plans to open a small gro­cery store.</p>
    <p>Many laid-off blue-col­lar work­ers say their dues are un­paid.</p>
    <p>Ms Ma­rina Sul­tana, di­rec­tor of pro­grammes at the Dhaka-based Refugee and Mi­gra­tory Move­ments Re­search Unit, asked: “Don’t em­ploy­ers have a re­spon­si­bil­ity for their em­ploy­ees when a cri­sis erupts? Or do they dump their help­less work­ers in an even more help­less sit­u­a­tion?”</p>
    <p>Ma­jor mi­grant-source coun­tries like In­dia and Bangladesh should col­lec­tively ad­vo­cate to bet­ter pro­tect their work­ers’ rights, and also iden­tify po­ten­tial j ob mar­kets abroad to train re­turned mi­grants ac­cord­ingly, Ms Sul­tana said.</p>
    <p>“An un­em­ployed mi­grant will not feel se­cure un­til he or she has a steady job.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jan said: “A cleaner in Sin­ga­pore or Dubai will not work as a cleaner in In­dia, that’s a re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that be­fore re­turnees who are stay­ing home “burn through their sav­ings and fall in deep fi­nan­cial cri­sis”, states must en­cour­age them to in­vest in small busi­nesses that also cre­ate em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>The High Com­mis­sion of In­dia in Sin­ga­pore said 17,000 Indians have been evac­u­ated on 115 flights, most of them trav­el­ling to the cities of Tiruchi­rap­palli, Coim­bat­ore, Madu­rai and Chennai in Tamil Nadu in the past five months. The High Com­mis­sion said 15,000 now await travel and that new reg­is­tra­tions are tak­ing place ev­ery day.</p>
