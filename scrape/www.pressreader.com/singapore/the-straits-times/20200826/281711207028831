    <p>There were 31 new coronaviru­s cases con­firmed by the Min­istry of Health ( MOH) yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,435.</p>
    <p>This is the low­est daily fig­ure in more than five months since March 22, when there were 23 cases.</p>
    <p>There were also no com­mu­nity cases from yes­ter­day’s update, said the Health Min­istry. The last time there were no cases in the com­mu­nity was last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>A 25-year-old woman was the sole im­ported case an­nounced yes­ter­day among the new ones.</p>
    <p>The per­ma­nent res­i­dent re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on Aug 13. She was placed on stay­home no­tice when she ar­rived and was con­firmed to be pos­i­tive on Monday.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 30 new cases an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among the 30 cases in dor­mi­to­ries, 26 had been tested dur­ing quar­an­tine to de­ter­mine their sta­tus.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing four cases were de­tected through MOH’s sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as the min­istry’s rou­tine test­ing ev­ery two weeks of work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The min­istry did not an­nounce any new clus­ters yes­ter­day or add new places to its list of lo­ca­tions vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks, it said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 230 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 54,801 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 78 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 1,514 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties, with none in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks, said the Min­istry of Health. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
