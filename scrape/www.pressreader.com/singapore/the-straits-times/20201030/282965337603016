    <p>WHO</p>
    <p>Home-grown singer-com­poser Dick Lee, 64, is a Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent who has penned songs for some of Sin­ga­pore’s best-loved stage mu­si­cals such as Beauty World (1988) and Fried Rice Par­adise (1991). He also com­posed the all-time favourite Na­tional Day theme song, Home.</p>
    <p>My work in the past few years has been more con­sul­ta­tive, so I did not have to deal with a big dis­rup­tion to my sched­ule when Covid-19 hit.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic, I have no­ticed my week­days blur­ring into week­ends and my weeks mor­ph­ing into months.</p>
    <p>I live in Chi­na­town. I’m up at the crack of dawn by 6.30am, and have my cof­fee and read The Straits Times on­line by 7.15am. I don’t have break­fast as I’m on an in­ter­mit­tent fast­ing reg­i­men, which means no food from 8pm till noon the next day.</p>
    <p>Twice a week, I go for my swim at the Sin­ga­pore Is­land Coun­try Club in Up­per Thom­son and Fri­days are usu­ally one of those days. My driver picks me up at 10.30am for my 10-lap swim, fol­lowed by lunch at the club.</p>
    <p>My brothers and I re­tained my par­ents’ driver af­ter they died as he’s prac­ti­cally part of the fam­ily, so I go out with him since my brothers rarely need a driver.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a light bite, I usu­ally rack my brains for some­where to go, but al­ways end up at the su­per­mar­ket. I am a fan of su­per­mar­kets. If I were over­seas, I would pre­fer Sains­bury’s to the Sis­tine Chapel.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, I ro­tate be­tween Sheng Siong, FairPrice and the fab­u­lous Cold Stor­age at Great World City. The Sheng Siong at Tan­glin Halt has the largest, most var­ied and cheap­est veg­etable and seafood se­lec­tion any­where on the is­land.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing more time on my hands has also prod­ded me to­wards my pi­ano. I brushed up on Bach, hav­ing so far learnt a cou­ple of pieces by heart. This newly rekin­dled pas­time has led me to pen a cou­ple of tunes, which have re­sulted in some new songs – my first in a long time.</p>
    <p>The other thing I re­vis­ited was my love of draw­ing. I em­barked on a mis­sion to sketch my fam­ily mem­bers from tiny black-and-white pho­to­graphs from our fam­ily al­bums, us­ing a mag­ni­fy­ing glass. These are on show at the</p>
    <p>Na­tional Mu­seum’s on­line ex­hi­bi­tion, #Nev­erBe­foreSG.</p>
