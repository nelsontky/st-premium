    <p>The United States Fed­eral Re­serve’s move to pri­ori­tise a strong job mar­ket over in­fla­tion gave lo­cal in­vestors a shot of op­ti­mism yes­ter­day and sent shares a touch higher.</p>
    <p>The prospect of low in­ter­est rates for the fore­see­able fu­ture was enough to lift t he bench­mark Straits Times In­dex by 0.79 per cent, or 19.82 points, to 2,539.63 and ahead for the week.</p>
    <p>Gain­ers out­num­bered losers 228 to 208 with 2.41 bil­lion shares worth $1.2 bil­lion traded.</p>
    <p>Oanda se­nior mar­ket an­a­lyst Jef­frey Hal­ley said the news from the Fed was mostly ex­pected and is un­likely to struc­turally change the “buy-ev­ery­thing sen­ti­ment” of global stock mar­kets. But he warned that in­vestors should not expect low in­ter­est rates to last.</p>
    <p>“The US gov­ern­ment has a lot of bond is­suance it will need to do in that part of the curve to cover its eye-wa­ter­ing fis­cal deficits in the years ahead.</p>
    <p>“A good bout of in­fla­tion is go­ing to be about the only way the world will be able to de­flate gov­ern­ment debt to man­age­able lev­els.”</p>
    <p>Banks were among the top gain­ers. DBS Bank rose 1.47 per cent to $20.76, United Over­seas Bank added 0.92 per cent to $19.66, while OCBC</p>
    <p>Bank gained 1.16 per cent to $8.71.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts were a top favourite: Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust ad­vanced 2.5 per cent to $1.64, while Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust put on 2.15 per cent to $1.90.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion coun­ters also booked gains. Sin­ga­pore Air­lines rose 1.38 per cent to $3.68 and gate­way so­lu­tions provider Sats gained 1.71 per cent to end the day at $2.98.</p>
    <p>Thai Bev­er­age was the most ac­tively traded, with 46.5 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands as it put on 0.82 per cent to 61.5 cents.</p>
    <p>Jar­dine Group com­pa­nies were among the big­gest de­clin­ers. Dairy Farm fell 1.41 per cent to US$4.21, while Jar­dine Cy­cle and Car­riage lost 0.11 per cent to $19.11. Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings fell 0.38 per cent and Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings dipped 0.05 per cent.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Asia, Malaysian shares slipped 1.9 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex added 0.56 per cent and the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite ral­lied 1.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi closed up 0.4 per cent, but the Nikkei 225 In­dex lost 1.41 per cent on news that Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe will re­sign for health rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian mar­ket was hit by losses among min­ing giants and tech firms and closed down 0.86 per cent – a sec­ond con­sec­u­tive week of de­cline – al­though the Aus­tralian dol­lar kept head­ing north and is now 31 per cent up against the green­back since March.</p>
