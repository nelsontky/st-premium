    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong’s pro­posal to cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans to ex­press their views on core is­sues that af­fect their lives, as well as on Sin­ga­pore’s fu­ture di­rec­tion, will be wel­comed by many (Op­por­tu­ni­ties to give views with­out be­ing shouted down to be cre­ated, Aug 29).</p>
    <p>Mr Tong high­lighted how peo­ple with dif­fer­ent and strong views may be­come “abra­sive”. To avoid such a de­struc­tive out­come, cer­tain pre­con­di­tions must pre­vail.</p>
    <p>First, all par­tic­i­pants must think ra­tio­nally in the best in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore and its cit­i­zens. Al­ter­na­tive views and pro­pos­als must be con­struc­tive and fact-based.</p>
    <p>While par­tic­i­pants are en­ti­tled to their opin­ions, they should not be ma­nip­u­lat­ing and man­u­fac­tur­ing in­for­ma­tion, like what hap­pens with fake news.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, al­ter­na­tive views, es­pe­cially those dif­fer­ent from the Govern­ment’s, should not be pre­sumed to be in­fe­rior. Dif­fer­ent views can rep­re­sent the “yin and yang” of the an­cient Chi­nese phi­los­o­phy of du­al­ism, which de­scribes how seem­ingly op­pos­ing or con­trary forces may ac­tu­ally be com­ple­men­tary and in­ter­de­pen­dent, lead­ing to bal­ance and har­mony, thus strength­en­ing the whole.</p>
    <p>Third, the Govern­ment should be will­ing to share rel­e­vant non-pub­licly avail­able in­for­ma­tion so that non-gov­ern­men­tal di­a­logue par­tic­i­pants are en­gaged on a level play­ing field and do not make in­ac­cu­rate or wrong in­fer­ences or es­ti­mates in their anal­y­ses.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment must be ready to dis­abuse Sin­ga­pore­ans of their mis­guided no­tions or mis­un­der­stand­ing with facts and fig­ures, not just un­con­vinc­ing rhetor­i­cal state­ments.</p>
    <p>Fourth, there should be a freer me­dia to pro­vide ob­jec­tive re­port­ing. In fact, in to­day’s po­lit­i­cal cli­mate in which Sin­ga­pore­ans are clam­our­ing for fair­ness, the me­dia must take on the big­ger roles of fact-check­ing and in­ves­tiga­tive jour­nal­ism.</p>
    <p>This year’s gen­eral elec­tion showed that there is a grow­ing de­sire for greater di­ver­sity of views. Dur­ing the cam­paign pe­riod, many gen­uine griev­ances and anx­i­eties were raised, with calls for greater ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency, and space and tol­er­ance for di­ver­gent views.</p>
    <p>In this con­text, the na­tional di­a­logue can tap the fresh ideas of many cit­i­zens who sin­cerely wish to be in­volved in the af­fairs of the state.</p>
    <p>Prop­erly man­aged, such a ro­bust con­test of ideas au­gurs well for Sin­ga­pore and should be en­cour­aged.</p>
