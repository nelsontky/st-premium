    <p>Re­searchers here have dis­cov­ered that Asians with di­a­betes and heart fail­ure fare worse in the hos­pi­tal if they look trim but have a belly.</p>
    <p>This chal­lenges the as­sump­tion that di­a­betes is as­so­ci­ated with obe­sity.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in this group of di­a­betic and heart fail­ure pa­tients have large waist-to-height ra­tios and low body mass index, said the Na­tional Heart Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore (NHCS) on Friday.</p>
    <p>These “lean-fat” pa­tients had the high­est risk of poor hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion out­comes com­pared with other pa­tients with di­a­betes and heart fail­ure, re­searchers at NHCS found.</p>
    <p>Dr Chan­chal Chan­dramouli, a re­search fel­low at NHCS, said on Friday: “The lean di­a­betic clus­ter was as­so­ci­ated with the worst qual­ity of life and com­pos­ite out­comes, with 79 per cent greater risk of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion and mor­tal­ity at one year, com­pared with other clus­ters.”</p>
    <p>This group of pa­tients was com­pared with four other groups of pa­tients in Asia that had di­a­betes and heart fail­ure – the el­derly, the young, those who are obese and have hy­per­ten­sion, and those with nar­row­ing ar­ter­ies or re­duced blood flow to the heart.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Carolyn Lam, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the cen­tre’s depart­ment of car­di­ol­ogy, said that know­ing the dis­mal prog­no­sis of lean di­a­betic pa­tients with heart fail­ure and the lack of proven ther­a­pies to im­prove their prog­no­sis, NHCS re­searchers firmly be­lieve that pre­vent­ing fu­ture car­diac dis­ease among high-risk di­a­betic pa­tients with no symp­toms is ex­tremely crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the re­searchers are also work­ing on an Asia-wide study on pre­ven­tive treat­ment for di­a­betic in­di­vid­u­als iden­ti­fied to have a high risk of de­vel­op­ing heart dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The Asian Di­a­betes Out­come Pre­ven­tion Trial (Adopt) study will see re­searchers from NHCS work­ing with their coun­ter­parts from Malaysia, China, Tai­wan, In­dia and the United Arab Emi­rates, the cen­tre said on Friday.</p>
    <p>The Adopt team aims to re­cruit 2,400 vol­un­teers for its study, with a fol­low-up over a du­ra­tion of four years.</p>
    <p>Di­a­betic in­di­vid­u­als with a high risk of heart dis­ease will be iden­ti­fied us­ing blood biomarker-based screen­ing for in­ten­sive pre­ven­tive treat­ment.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor David Sim, di­rec­tor of NHCS’ heart fail­ure pro­gramme, said the treat­ment will in­volve pre­scrib­ing drugs typ­i­cally used to treat heart dis­ease to pa­tients who have been iden­ti­fied as high-risk, but who have no pre-ex­ist­ing car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­eases.</p>
    <p>“If Adopt proves that a sim­ple blood test can iden­tify in­di­vid­u­als with di­a­betes who will ben­e­fit from in­ten­sive pre­ven­tive ther­apy with com­monly avail­able med­i­ca­tions, re­sults can di­rectly im­pact clin­i­cal prac­tice not only in Sin­ga­pore, but also in other parts of the world,” said Prof Lam.</p>
    <p>The study fol­lows ear­lier find­ings by NHCS re­searchers – who com­pared data of Asian and Cau­casian pa­tients with heart fail­ure be­tween 2012 and 2016 – that three times as many Asian than Cau­casian heart dis­ease pa­tients had di­a­betes.</p>
