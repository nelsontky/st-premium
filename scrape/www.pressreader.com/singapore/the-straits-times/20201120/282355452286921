    <p>The heart says Sin­ga­pore Der­byQueen El­iz­a­beth II Cup hero Top Knight is the horse to beat in to­mor­row’s $1 mil­lion Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Gold Cup, but the head says oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, tra­di­tion is against the top­weight win­ning Sin­ga­pore’s pre­mier clas­sic.</p>
    <p>More of­ten than not, the honours have gone to lightweigh­ts, be­cause the hand­i­cap con­di­tions make the race more in­trigu­ing. Ten of the last 12 win­ners car­ried 53kg and be­low.</p>
    <p>The last top­weight to win was Smart Bet with 59kg in 2002.</p>
    <p>So, can Top Knight break the jinx with 57kg as the high­est-rated con­tender in the ca­pac­ity field of 16? I reckon he can.</p>
    <p>He is the stayer of the mo­ment and is wor­thy to be named a re­serve in next month’s pres­ti­gious In­ter­na­tional Group 1 Hong Kong Mile at Sha Tin.</p>
    <p>If you had seen the way he rat­tled home from way back to cap­ture the $400,000 Group 1 Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup in his last start on Oct 31, you would be vouch­ing for the Fal­con Rac­ing No. 7 Stable­owned gal­loper to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>He made his op­po­si­tion look like they were stand­ing still. The ex­tra 200m will suit him to a T.</p>
    <p>But, un­like set-weight or weight­for-age events, he will have to con­cede weight all round to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>And, as they say in rac­ing, weight can stop a train.</p>
    <p>While his class may pull him through, I am opt­ing for his upand-com­ing sta­ble­mate Big Hearted, who should have a big say as one of the joint bot­tomweights car­ry­ing just 50kg.</p>
    <p>Also pre­pared by lead­ing trainer Michael Cle­ments, Big Hearted won on QE II Cup Day over the same 1,800m trip.</p>
    <p>He car­ried 54.5kg to zoom home in 1min 48.72sec, com­pared to Top Knight’s 1min 52.33sec, al­beit on a</p>
    <p>wet­ter track a few races later.</p>
    <p>He qual­i­fied with the min­i­mum 50kg. The 7kg can make a lot of dif­fer­ence in a hand­i­cap race over the 2,000m trip.</p>
    <p>Granted, it is a big jump from Class 3 to Cup level, but Big Hearted is a horse going places. His lat­est win was his fifth in 11 starts.</p>
    <p>The horse he beat, Ocean Cross­ing, gets in with only 51kg, a big 6kg re­prieve. He is an­other lively light­weight chance.</p>
    <p>His trainer, Lee Freed­man, has three other top can­di­dates – last year’s Gold Cup win­ner Mr Clint (55.5kg), last year’s Derby win­ner Sun Mar­shal (55kg) and Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>(54.5kg).</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter was runner-up in the QE II Cup, while Mr Clint fin­ished a fan­tas­tic third.</p>
    <p>Trainer Shane Baertschig­er’s Ara­maayo is an­other top con­tender on his Kranji Mile-Raf­fles Cup suc­cesses, but will also be giv­ing some weight with 56kg on his back. While classy as well, he needs a good track to per­form his best.</p>
    <p>If Top Knight wins the Gold Cup, he will most likely be voted Horse of the Year.</p>
    <p>But will his class or tra­di­tion pre­vail to­mor­row? Let us see.</p>
