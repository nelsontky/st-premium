    <p>SEOUL • South Korea re­ported a record 1,097 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing an out­break in a Seoul prison that in­fected 188, as the coun­try’s lat­est wave of Covid-19 wors­ens.</p>
    <p>With daily in­fec­tions over 1,000 for a fifth straight day, some med­i­cal ex­perts and politi­cians crit­i­cised the gov­ern­ment for be­ing too loose with so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>The re­cent surge – stem­ming mostly from wide­spread clus­ters rather than the large, iso­lated out­breaks of the pre­vi­ous waves – has con­founded ef­forts to con­tain it and the coun­try is run­ning short of hospi­tal beds.</p>
    <p>The daily to­tal ex­ceeded last Wed­nes­day’s record 1,076, ac­cord­ing to data from the Korea Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency.</p>
    <p>The new cases brought the coun­try’s to­tal num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions to 49,665, with 674 Covid-19 deaths. The prison in south-east­ern Seoul had 188 in­mates and staff in­fected, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions linked to the fa­cil­ity to 215.</p>
    <p>There are also smaller out­breaks in nurs­ing homes, hos­pi­tals, churches, a ski re­sort and a golf course.</p>
    <p>“It is a dan­ger­ous sit­u­a­tion,” Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo said, adding that ef­forts to broaden test­ing to asymp­to­matic peo­ple should slow the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has been re­luc­tant to tighten so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions to the high­est level, wor­ry­ing that busi­nesses would grind to a halt and the econ­omy would be hit.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics say the gov­ern­ment needs to bite the bul­let and im­pose tougher re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment re­laxed so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules too early. When they needed to be strength­ened, the gov­ern­ment has acted too slowly,” said Dr Lee Hyuk­min, a pro­fes­sor in the depart­ment of lab­o­ra­tory medicine at Yon­sei Univer­sity.</p>
