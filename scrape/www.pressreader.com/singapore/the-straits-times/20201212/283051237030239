    <p>The prop­erty in­dus­try ran its first vir­tual Sin­ga­pore Prop­erty Show</p>
    <p>2020 (SPS 2020) on Oc­to­ber 10 to great suc­cess. Jointly or­gan­ised by PropNex Re­alty, Me­di­a­corp and 99.Co., the four-week event was the talk of the in­dus­try, as it gar­nered over one mil­lion out­reach through the of­fi­cial SPS 2020 web­site and var­i­ous so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>There were im­mer­sive 4D vir­tual tours of the fea­tured new launch projects, var­i­ous on­line prop­erty tools such as mort­gage cal­cu­la­tors and en­gag­ing ar­ti­cles on the lat­est in the prop­erty mar­ket, but the high­light was a se­ries of in­for­ma­tive and en­gag­ing weekly we­bi­nars by PropNex.</p>
    <p>EN­GAG­ING WE­BI­NARS BY PROP­ERTY FRONT RUN­NERS</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 40 we­bi­nars (in­clu­sive of 17 vir­tual open houses fea­tur­ing 20 in-house speak­ers and five guest speak­ers), was held via Zoom and Face­book, as well as at showflats dur­ing the first week­end of SPS 2020.</p>
    <p>Th­ese we­bi­nars of­fered first-hand in­sights into the Sin­ga­pore prop­erty mar­ket and prop­erty in­vest­ment strate­gies, cour­tesy of renowned prop­erty front run­ners, bankers, lawyers and fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sors.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar Me­di­a­corp hosts such as Daniel Mar­tin, Ver­netta Lopez, Chua Lee Lian and Bukoh Mary en­gaged on­line view­ers and speak­ers in be­tween the we­bi­nars, adding much ex­cite­ment to the show. There were also lucky draws for view­ers to par­tic­i­pate from home.</p>
    <p>AC­CESS TO ONESTOP SO­LU­TION FOR PROP­ERTY EN­THU­SI­ASTS FROM HOME</p>
    <p>View­ers of SPS 2020 have shared pos­i­tive re­views. Mr Fred­er­ick Seah, who was in­vited by a PropNex sales­per­son, said: “SPS 2020 of­fers a per­fect one-stop so­lu­tion by pro­vid­ing prop­erty-re­lated in­for­ma­tion and knowl­edge on a sin­gle plat­form for view­ers to ac­cess. My fam­ily was home and we se­lected the few pro­grammes that drew our in­ter­ests to watch in the com­fort of our home”.</p>
    <p>He also at­tended “Feng­shui Talk” by Master Mark Tan, “3 stages of Prop­erty In­vest­ment” by Kelvin Fong and “Ma­rina One Res­i­dences Open House”.</p>
    <p>Over the next three week­ends, more we­bi­nars were con­ducted vir­tu­ally on top­ics cov­er­ing the prop­erty mas­ter­plan, HDB mar­ket and the lat­est anal­y­sis of pri­vate prop­erty prices.</p>
    <p>On the fi­nal week­end, the PropNex team went ‘live’ to an­swer burn­ing ques­tions from first-time prop­erty in­vestors, HDB up­graders and sea­soned prop­erty in­vestors. It led to in­sight­ful con­ver­sa­tions with prop­erty front run­ners, PropNex’s Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Of­fi­cer Is­mail Gafoor, Ex­ec­u­tive Di­rec­tor Kelvin Fong and Key Ex­ec­u­tive Of­fi­cer Lim Yong Hock at the PropNex head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Is­mail said: “PropNex is proud to be part of the Sin­ga­pore Prop­erty Show 2020 to­gether with our part­ners, Me­di­a­corp and 99.Co. With the re­sound­ing re­sponse from view­ers, par­tic­i­pat­ing de­vel­op­ers and our sales­per­sons, PropNex is ex­cited to bring back the prop­erty show next year, with wider range of we­bi­nars and speak­ers on board.”</p>
