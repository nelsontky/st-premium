    <p>Of course it is dis­ap­point­ing, but I un­der­stand that it is no one’s fault and ev­ery­one is try­ing their best. If I’m meant to go one day, then I will get to go even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>AD­MIN­IS­TRA­TIVE AS­SIS­TANT MADAM ROSNI, who had to can­cel a planned pil­grim­age in March and is not hope­ful about be­ing able to make the trip this year.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Council of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) yes­ter­day com­mended the As­so­ci­a­tion of Mus­lim Travel Agents of Sin­ga­pore (Am­tas) for its stance on dis­cour­ag­ing lo­cal Mus­lims from trav­el­ling to Saudi Ara­bia to per­form the um­rah, or mi­nor pil­grim­age.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion, which rep­re­sents more than 50 tour agen­cies, had ear­lier called on Mus­lims in Sin­ga­pore to be pa­tient and put off plans for the pil­grim­age, to pro­tect them­selves and the wider com­mu­nity from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Am­tas gave a brief­ing to re­porters from the Malay me­dia on Wed­nes­day re­gard­ing its po­si­tion on the um­rah.</p>
    <p>In its brief­ing pre­sen­ta­tion, which was seen by ST, Am­tas said that in the short term, it is not ad­vis­able for the um­rah pil­grim­age to go ahead this year. “We ask the Mus­lim com­mu­nity here to be pa­tient for now,” it said.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of Mus­lims from across the world travel to Saudi Ara­bia on um­rah pil­grim­ages through­out the year. These in­volve mak­ing the jour­ney to Is­lam’s two holi­est sites of Mecca and Me­d­ina to per­form re­li­gious rites.</p>
    <p>The Gulf state drew 19 mil­lion vis­i­tors i n 2019, but the num­ber plunged dras­ti­cally af­ter it im­posed travel re­stric­tions last Fe­bru­ary and stopped for­eign pil­grims from en­ter­ing to stem the spread of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Saudi au­thor­i­ties had ear­lier an­nounced that the coun­try would start receiving for­eign vis­i­tors from Nov 1, but later said that it will close its bor­ders once more, fol­low­ing re­ports of a new, more con­ta­gious vari­ant of Covid-19 ear­lier in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Muis said yes­ter­day that Am­tas has taken a re­spon­si­ble ap­proach in dis­cour­ag­ing the um­rah pil­grim­age for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>It said in a me­dia re­lease: “Muis shares Am­tas’ com­mit­ment to pro­tect prospec­tive pil­grims and the wider com­mu­nity from the risk of in­fec­tion. Am­tas’ ap­proach is also in line with the pre­vail­ing na­tional guide­lines on over­seas travel.”</p>
    <p>The council noted that the pan­demic has in­tro­duced many risks and un­cer­tain­ties over over­seas travel.</p>
    <p>These in­clude t he need for manda­tory test­ing and quar­an­tine re­quire­ments, which will ap­ply when the trav­ellers reach their des­ti­na­tions, as well as on their re­turn to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There will also be sig­nif­i­cant costs in­curred should the trav­ellers get in­fected and are hos­pi­talised, said Muis, adding that they may face the pos­si­bil­ity of flight can­cel­la­tions and changes too. It cited these as fac­tors against trav­el­ling to Saudi Ara­bia for the um­rah.</p>
    <p>Muis added that it will con­tinue work­ing with Am­tas and the rel­e­vant gov­ern­ment au­thor­i­ties to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion and as­sess when it would be safe and ap­pro­pri­ate for um­rah travel to re­sume.</p>
    <p>This will be de­cided in line with over­all na­tional guide­lines for over­seas travel.</p>
    <p>“Our ut­most pri­or­ity re­mains the safety and well-be­ing of our pil­grims and our wider com­mu­nity,” said Muis.</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant Madam Rosni, 54, had planned to go on the pil­grim­age last March but can­celled the trip due to Covid-19. She was ear­lier told that she could post­pone it to this year, but she is not so hope­ful any­more.</p>
    <p>“Of course it is dis­ap­point­ing, but I un­der­stand that it is no one’s fault and ev­ery­one is try­ing their best. If I’m meant to go one day, then I will get to go even­tu­ally,” she said.</p>
