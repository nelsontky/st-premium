    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand of­fi­cials are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the pos­si­bil­ity that its first Covid-19 cases in more than three months were im­ported by freight, as the coun­try’s big­gest city plunged back into lock­down yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The dis­cov­ery of four in­fected fam­ily mem­bers in Auck­land led Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern to swiftly reim­pose tight re­stric­tions in the city and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures across the en­tire coun­try.</p>
    <p>The source of the out­break has baf­fled health of­fi­cials, who said they were con­fi­dent there was no lo­cal trans­mis­sion of the virus in New Zealand for 102 days.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing hard to put to­gether pieces of the puz­zle on how this fam­ily got in­fected,” said Di­rec­tor-Gen­eral of Health Ash­ley Bloom­field.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions were ze­ro­ing in on the po­ten­tial the virus was im­ported by freight. Dr Bloom­field said sur­face test­ing was un­der way at an Auck­land cool store where a man from the in­fected fam­ily worked. “We know the virus can sur­vive within re­frig­er­ated en­vi­ron­ments for quite some time,” Dr Bloom­field said dur­ing a tele­vised me­dia con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand unit of USbased Ameri­cold Realty Trust, a re­frig­er­ated stor­age spe­cial­ist with op­er­a­tions in the United States,</p>
    <p>Canada, Ar­gentina and Aus­tralia as well as New Zealand, iden­ti­fied it­self as the owner of the cool store.</p>
    <p>Ameri­cold NZ man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Richard Win­nall told the NZ Her­ald news­pa­per that the in­fected man had been on sick leave for sev­eral days and all em­ploy­ees had been sent home for tests.</p>
    <p>China has re­ported sev­eral in­stances of the coro­n­avirus be­ing de­tected on the pack­ag­ing of im­ported frozen seafood in re­cent weeks. In the lat­est in­ci­dent, the virus was found on the pack­ag­ing of frozen shrimp from Ecuador. The shrimp had been bought by a res­tau­rant in Wuhu city, in China’s eastern An­hui prov­ince, state me­dia re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion web­site states that there is cur­rently no con­firmed case of Covid-19 trans­mit­ted through food or food pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>But it also notes that stud­ies have shown that the virus can sur­vive for up to 72 hours on plas­tic.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of Auck­land, home to around 1.7 mil­lion peo­ple, were given just hours to pre­pare for the re­turn to level three re­stric­tions yes­ter­day, re­quir­ing peo­ple to stay at home un­less for es­sen­tial trips.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing hard, go­ing early with lock­down is still the best re­sponse,” Ms Ardern said.</p>
    <p>“Our re­sponse to the virus so far has worked... we know how to beat this.”</p>
    <p>The rest of the coun­try was placed back into slightly looser level two re­stric­tions. The re­stric­tions will ini­tially re­main in place un­til to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Po­lice set up road­blocks to dis­cour­age a mass ex­o­dus from Auck­land, while su­per­mar­kets ra­tioned the sale of some sta­ple prod­ucts amid a rush to the shelves. Long queues formed at Covid-19 test­ing cen­tres in the city.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said her Cab­i­net will de­cide to­mor­row on the next steps with re­gard to the re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>She also de­layed a key step to­wards a Sept 19 gen­eral elec­tion, sus­pend­ing the dis­so­lu­tion of Par­lia­ment, which usu­ally kicks off cam­paign­ing, un­til Mon­day.</p>
    <p>A de­ci­sion on whether the ac­tual polls would be de­layed would be an­nounced be­fore Mon­day, she said, as the coun­try’s ma­jor op­po­si­tion party can­celled its week­end cam­paign launch and called for the elec­tion to be pushed back to Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>With around 1,500 con­firmed cases and 22 deaths, New Zealand’s ex­po­sure to the virus re­mains well be­low that of many other de­vel­oped na­tions.</p>
