    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) is seek­ing leave to be heard at the ap­pli­ca­tion hear­ing over al­leged mis­con­duct by two le­gal ser­vice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The AGC has also ap­plied to sub­mit court notes re­lated to the case in­volv­ing do­mes­tic maid Parti Liyani and place be­fore the Chief Jus­tice rel­e­vant ex­tracts of ev­i­dence Ms Parti, who was ac­quit­ted of theft, and other wit­nesses gave.</p>
    <p>The 46-year-old former maid of prom­i­nent busi­ness­man Liew Mun Leong is seek­ing the court’s per­mis­sion for an in­quiry into the con­duct of Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tors Tan Wee Hao and Tan Yany­ing.</p>
    <p>The two pros­e­cuted her case in the State Courts for theft, which she was con­victed of last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti’s orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons ap­pli­ca­tion was taken out on an ex parte ba­sis, which means only the ap­pli­cant can be heard, un­less the court says oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>The AGC is seek­ing to be rep­re­sented at the ap­pli­ca­tion hear­ing, and has also ap­plied to place ex­tracts from the record of pro­ceed­ings in the State Courts trial, as well as ev­i­dence notes per­tain­ing to her and wit­nesses Mr Liew and his wife, Madam Ng Lai Peng.</p>
    <p>The court notes also in­clude rel­e­vant ex­tracts from part of the ap­peal hear­ing on Nov 1 last year by Ms Parti be­fore Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn.</p>
    <p>Other doc­u­ments the AGC is seek­ing to place in­clude the pros­e­cu­tion’s clos­ing sub­mis­sions in the trial, as well as a copy of her ap­peal pe­ti­tion, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The AGC had, in Au­gust, in the same sum­mons, also sought to seek leave from the Chief Jus­tice for the two pros­e­cu­tors to ap­pear and be heard by their coun­sel in Ms Parti’s ap­pli­ca­tion hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Se­nior State Coun­sel Kristy Tan and Jeyen­dran Jeya­pal as well as State Coun­sel Jo­ce­lyn Teo were named to rep­re­sent the pair at the hear­ing, if ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The grounds of the ap­pli­ca­tion were set out in the sup­port­ing joint af­fi­davit of Mr Tan and Ms Tan that was at­tached.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, who was ac­quit­ted on ap­peal to the High Court ear­lier this month, had filed a com­plaint in June against the two le­gal ser­vice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>In July, lawyer Anil Balchan­dani was ap­pointed to act for her in re­la­tion to the com­plaint.</p>
    <p>He then filed an amended ver­sion for leave to be granted by the Chief Jus­tice for an in­ves­ti­ga­tion to be made into the mis­con­duct com­plaint against Mr Tan and/or Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>The sum­mons fur­ther re­quested the court give such other di­rec­tions as it deems fit.</p>
    <p>Both the orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons by Ms Parti and the ap­pli­ca­tion to be heard at the ex parte sum­mons hear­ing were made be­fore Jus­tice Chan de­liv­ered his ap­peal de­ci­sion ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>A pre-trial con­fer­ence was held on Wed­nes­day, and a fur­ther case man­age­ment hear­ing will be held in due course.</p>
