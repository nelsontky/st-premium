    <p>It is worrisome that the num­ber of on­line fraud cases surged in the first six months of the year com­pared with the same pe­riod last year ($82 mil­lion lost in six months through 10 main types of scams, Aug 27).</p>
    <p>I am puz­zled by the ex­po­nen­tial rise in scams in­volv­ing e-com­merce plat­forms. From what I know, most e-com­merce op­er­a­tors have a de­fault fraud preven­tion mech­a­nism which is very use­ful to de­ter crime.</p>
    <p>I buy quite fre­quently from Lazada and Shopee, which were among the plat­forms high­lighted in the ar­ti­cle. I have al­ways felt as­sured that the money I pay for the goods is with­held in a form of es­crow with the op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>The funds are re­leased to mer­chants when cer­tain con­di­tions are met. One of them is a pre­de­ter­mined pe­riod of time, which is usu­ally set at 14 days af­ter re­ceipt. If there is any ano­maly in the trans­ac­tion, I can take ac­tion to work with the seller for a so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>It would be most help­ful to get de­tails on and ex­am­ples of the tac­tics em­ployed by scam­mers on those e-com­merce plat­forms. This way, we will be bet­ter pre­pared.</p>
