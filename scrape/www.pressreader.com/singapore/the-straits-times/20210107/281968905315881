    <p>Tobacco-caused dis­eases kill more than 2,200 peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore ev­ery year, ac­cord­ing to The Tobacco At­las.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-hand smoke, which has more than 4,000 ir­ri­tants, tox­ins and can­cer-caus­ing sub­stances, is also deadly, killing more than 300 non-smok­ers ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>But I do not see any real gump­tion in en­forc­ing “no smok­ing” rules.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­where you go, you can­not avoid walk­ing through sec­ond-hand smoke – at traf­fic lights when you are wait­ing to cross, dur­ing walks, and when you visit a cof­fee shop.</p>
    <p>Many cof­fee shops have de­mar­cated dining ar­eas for smok­ers, but lit­tle can be done to pre­vent the smoke from waft­ing over to other din­ers seated in non-smok­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, I wrote in to the PUB about a smok­ing-re­lated in­ci­dent that oc­curred at MacRitchie Reser­voir Park’s pickup point.</p>
    <p>I was sur­prised to learn from its re­ply that the park is tar­geted to be gazetted as a non-smok­ing park by this June.</p>
    <p>I had pre­sumed that all parks where peo­ple gather for recre­ation or ex­er­cise were smoke-free.</p>
    <p>Why does gazetting a nature park to be smoke-free need to be such a grad­ual process?</p>
    <p>It is al­ready so sti­fling to wear a mask ev­ery day. And yet when we get the chance to re­move it to ex­er­cise, we have to deal with sec­ond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>I hope that tougher anti-smok­ing mea­sures will be in­sti­tuted so that we all can have cleaner air to breathe. It is our right.</p>
