    <p>Two testers ar­rived at Cole­man’s home in Lex­ing­ton, Ken­tucky, at 7.15pm on Dec 9 last year.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can had said he would be home that evening, and by rule he had a one-hour win­dow to be tested. The testers said they knocked loudly ev­ery 10 min­utes for an hour but he was not present.</p>
    <p>The sprinter dis­putes this, claim­ing he was home and could re­mem­ber watch­ing the 8.15pm kick-off of a “Mon­day Night Foot­ball” game be­tween the New York Giants and Philadel­phia Ea­gles.</p>
    <p>The Ath­let­ics In­tegrity Unit (AIU) re­jected this ex­pla­na­tion as “sim­ply im­pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>It noted: “Shop­ping re­ceipts show that the ath­lete was shop­ping at least from 7.13pm, also pur­chased a chipo­tle at 7.53pm and fi­nally pur­chased 16 items from a Wal­mart Su­per­centre at 8.22pm.</p>
    <p>“The ath­lete’s ev­i­dence was that he re­turned home briefly some time be­tween 8 and 8.10pm, ate his chipo­tle while watch­ing the kick-off and then went out again. We do not ac­cept the ath­lete’s ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>“It would have been sim­ply im­pos­si­ble for him to pur­chase a chipo­tle at 7.53pm (the store be­ing 5-9 min­utes from his res­i­dence), drive home, park the car, go into his res­i­dence, eat the chipo­tle, then watch the kick-off of the foot­ball game which only started at 8.15pm, and there­after go out again in his car, drive to the store, and pick up 16 items at the Wal­mart Su­per­centre so as to be able to pay for them by 8.22 pm.”</p>
