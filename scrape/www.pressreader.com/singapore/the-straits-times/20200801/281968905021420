    <p>From the beaches in the Mediter­ranean to Lan­tau Is­land in Hong Kong, a new kind of waste is wash­ing ashore in dis­turb­ing quan­ti­ties – used face masks, dis­pos­able gloves and dis­carded hand sani­tiser bot­tles. Covid-19 may have dealt a body blow to sec­tors such as avi­a­tion and tourism, but it has been very good busi­ness for those in the plas­tics in­dus­try, which prior to the pan­demic was bat­tling a grow­ing aware­ness of the en­vi­ron­men­tal dan­gers posed by ris­ing amounts of dis­pos­able prod­ucts. While it is crit­i­cal that there be suf­fi­cient per­sonal pro­tec­tion equip­ment (PPE) to safe­guard health­care work­ers and stop the spread of the virus, it is im­por­tant too to not lose sight of the longer-term chal­lenge of pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment from the re­lent­less tide of plas­tic pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Con­sider the mag­ni­tude of the prob­lem: PPE is sin­gle-use by de­sign and made of dif­fer­ent sorts of plas­tic such as polypropy­lene and poly­eth­yl­ene in masks and gowns, and ni­trile and vinyl in gloves. Covid-19 has also led to a surge of on­line or­ders and take­away meals, adding to the need for plas­tic in dis­pos­able wrap­ping and table­ware.</p>
    <p>The num­bers in­volved are stag­ger­ing. China es­ti­mates that Wuhan hospi­tals pro­duced more than 240 tonnes of waste daily at the height of the out­break, com­pared with 40 tonnes nor­mally. Global sales of dis­pos­able face masks alone are set to grow from an es­ti­mated US$800 mil­lion in 2019 to US$166 bil­lion (S$227 bil­lion) this year, ac­cord­ing to an Unctad re­port this week. The US could gen­er­ate a year’s worth of med­i­cal waste in just two months, ac­cord­ing to an­other study. The Thai­land En­vi­ron­ment In­sti­tute reck­ons that plas­tic waste in the coun­try has shot up from 1,500 tonnes to 6,300 tonnes a day, largely be­cause of surg­ing home food de­liv­er­ies. Plas­tic pol­lu­tion was al­ready one of the great­est threats to the planet be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break, said Ms Pamela Coke-Hamil­ton, Unctad’s di­rec­tor of in­ter­na­tional trade. The sud­den boom in the daily use of cer­tain prod­ucts to keep peo­ple safe and stop the dis­ease is mak­ing things much worse.</p>
    <p>What’s to be done? There is no easy so­lu­tion while the world is strug­gling to con­tain the dis­ease and PPE is part of the so­lu­tion. Hos­pi­tal waste is in­cin­er­ated – not a per­fect op­tion but bet­ter than the pub­lic’s haz­ardous lit­ter­ing of used faced masks.</p>
    <p>More could be done to raise aware­ness of “Covid waste” and to en­cour­age busi­nesses and con­sumers to go for en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly, re­us­able op­tions. It could be as sim­ple as an optout op­tion for plas­tic uten­sils on food de­liv­ery apps. In the longer term, pol­i­cy­mak­ers should use this chal­lenge to step up ef­forts to build bet­ter waste man­age­ment sys­tems. The world ig­nored early warn­ings of a pan­demic. It should not do so again with the warn­ings of a plas­tic waste cri­sis.</p>
