    <p>It is Wed­nes­day in the head­quar­ters of Ence Mar­ket­ing Group in Raf­fles Place, and a course on us­ing a 360-de­gree cam­era is in ses­sion.</p>
    <p>But in­stead of con­duct­ing the train­ing in a small, 108 sq ft con­fer­ence room, the staff are seated at their desks in its 1,000 sq ft main of­fice area for so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>While they fid­dle with the con­trap­tion, the pre­sen­ters’ slides are pro­jected onto a large screen.</p>
    <p>This might be the of­fice of the fu­ture, a more reg­u­lated one where col­leagues sit far­ther apart, with masks on, and with many other em­ploy­ees work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>As part of safe-man­age­ment mea­sures for busi­nesses, em­ploy­ers here must en­sure that em­ploy­ees who have been work­ing from home con­tinue to do so.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees should re­turn to the of­fice only when it is demon­stra­bly nec­es­sary, such as to ac­cess spe­cialised ter­mi­nals or ded­i­cated ma­chines, or com­plete a con­tract or trans­ac­tion that is legally re­quired to be done in per­son and on-site.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, more peo­ple are work­ing re­motely, re­sult­ing in smaller of­fices and fewer work­ers in them. Tech­nol­ogy firm Fu­jitsu re­cently an­nounced a per­ma­nent work­from-home plan, and said it will cut its of­fice space in Ja­pan by half over the next three years.</p>
    <p>Since the out­break, many firms in Sin­ga­pore have also seen the emer­gence of a com­pany cul­ture which is less of­fice-cen­tric.</p>
    <p>Ms An­gela Sim, 44, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Ence Mar­ket­ing Group, which has of­fices in the re­gion, says that pre-Covid-19, it had al­ready in­vested in in­fra­struc­ture and soft­ware to al­low staff to work re­motely. But it did not im­ple­ment a full work-from-home ar­range­ment for its staff here, as they pre­ferred go­ing to the of­fice and in­ter­act­ing with col­leagues.</p>
    <p>“When Covid-19 hap­pened, we had no choice. We now go to the of­fice only when we have to use cer­tain spe­cialised equip­ment.”</p>
    <p>Even then, many safety mea­sures have to be fol­lowed. Be­fore en­ter­ing the of­fice, staff need to have their tem­per­a­ture taken and checkin via SafeEn­try. Work sta­tions have to be more spread out, with only four staff at a ta­ble, in­stead of six pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>More strin­gent hy­giene prac­tices at the work­place are now also the norm.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, when the In­ter­na­tional Cen­tre for Tho­racic Surgery, a clinic at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Spe­cial­ist Cen­tre, re­opened on June 15, it placed hand soap and hand sani­tiser at ev­ery sink in the clinic.</p>
    <p>Af­ter each pa­tient leaves, a clinic as­sis­tant wipes down the com­mon area, door han­dles and sofa. Only one staff mem­ber can be at the reg­is­tra­tion counter at any time and staff can­not con­gre­gate in the pantry.</p>
    <p>At WeWork, which op­er­ates 12 co-work­ing spa­ces in Sin­ga­pore, vinyl floor de­cals and wall signs dis­play­ing the ex­pected 1m safe dis­tanc­ing can be found in the hall­ways and com­mu­nity ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Many firms have also lever­aged on tech­nol­ogy in a big­ger way since the out­break.</p>
    <p>At dig­i­tal con­sul­tancy firm 2359 Me­dia, chat­bots are be­com­ing an in­te­gral part of the of­fice. Since April, its of­fice land­line has been an­swered by a voice chat­bot ca­pa­ble of ask­ing call­ers what they need, pro­vid­ing sim­ple so­lu­tions or redi­rect­ing them to the rel­e­vant de­part­ment.</p>
    <p>If the chat­bot does not have an an­swer, it takes down a mes­sage and staff will re­turn the call.</p>
    <p>Since early Fe­bru­ary, the com­pany has also been us­ing a chat­bot which logs em­ploy­ees’ daily tem­per­a­ture, health sta­tus and whether they vis­ited the of­fice that day.</p>
    <p>While ex­perts ex­pect work­places to be­come smaller in the fu­ture, law firm PKWA Law Prac­tice is buck­ing the trend for now. Its of­fice at the HDB Hub build­ing in Toa Payoh ex­panded in May, when it took over an ad­ja­cent of­fice unit so its desks could be more spaced out.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Chong Boon, a di­rec­tor at the firm, says the move was to en­sure a safe work­ing en­vi­ron­ment for its more than 100 em­ploy­ees. But l ook­ing ahead, he be­lieves there will be less of a need for of­fice space.</p>
    <p>“Our l awyers al­ready con­duct video hear­ings and video meet­ings from home, where pos­si­ble,” he adds.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Ms Sheila Cheng, a fam­ily and di­vorce lawyer at the firm per­forms tasks such as draft­ing le­gal doc­u­ments and an­swer­ing clients’ e-mails from her apart­ment in Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>“Work­ing from home gives me greater flex­i­bil­ity, say, to pre­pare a sim­ple lunch in my kitchen, or take short breaks dur­ing the day so I can fo­cus bet­ter,” says the 28-year-old.</p>
    <p>“Although there are in­con­ve­niences, such as hav­ing to wait for col­leagues to an­swer a What­sApp mes­sage, in­stead of be­ing able to sim­ply walk up to their desks, it does seem like the of­fice of the fu­ture can be a home of­fice.”</p>
    <p>For the staff in Sin­ga­pore-based ar­ti­fi­cial-in­tel­li­gence com­pany Sqreem Tech­nolo­gies, work­ing from home is al­ready a re­al­ity. It has more than 130 em­ploy­ees in six coun­tries – of which eight peo­ple work in the com­pany’s head­quar­ters here – and ev­ery­one has been work­ing from home since March.</p>
    <p>Its Sin­ga­pore team pre­vi­ously op­er­ated from a co-work­ing space in Chi­na­town and it still has a lease there un­til Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>You could work from a beach</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic, there has been more de­mand among com­pa­nies for tech­nolo­gies re­lated to air pu­rifi­ca­tion, tem­per­a­ture screen­ing, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and con­tact trac­ing, says Mr Alvin Ng, Asia-Pa­cific vice-pres­i­dent of dig­i­tal so­lu­tions at build­ing tech­nolo­gies and so­lu­tions com­pany John­son Con­trols.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves the of­fice space of the fu­ture will in­volve rapidly ad­vanc­ing tech­nolo­gies, such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and the In­ter­net of Things.</p>
    <p>It might even have blinds and lights that can be eas­ily con­trolled from one’s phone, or lifts that know which floor to go to with­out the user hav­ing to touch any but­tons, he adds.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Tham, se­nior mar­ket an­a­lyst at mar­ket re­search firm IDC, notes that since the Covid-19 out­break, the dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion of or­gan­i­sa­tions across the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion has ac­cel­er­ated.</p>
    <p>“Whether by choice or cir­cum­stance, or­gan­i­sa­tions are mov­ing from ana­logue to dig­i­tal, and we be­lieve this trend will con­tinue post-pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>With more peo­ple work­ing</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive, Mr Ian Chap­man-Banks, says: “I be­lieve that for many firms, of­fice space will be­come re­dun­dant as teams re­alise they are able to work ef­fec­tively from home. This is thanks to the mul­ti­tude of Web con­fer­ence apps out there, which have al­lowed us to be as pro­duc­tive – if not more so.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Joanna Chua, Sqreem Tech­nolo­gies’ busi­ness di­rec­tor, work of­ten in­volves late evening calls with clients in North Amer­ica or Europe, and work­ing from home al­lows her to plan her time bet­ter.</p>
    <p>She says: “I do miss see­ing my col­leagues and the so­cial in­ter­ac­tion I get from work­ing in an of­fice, but we chat on Zoom reg­u­larly.” from home, he says or­gan­i­sa­tions might want to en­sure that em­ploy­ees’ homes are pro­duc­tive and se­cure, pos­si­bly by pro­vid­ing a bud­get for er­gonomic ta­bles and chairs, or by in­stalling cer­tain soft­ware tools on com­put­ers used for work to en­sure bet­ter se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of an of­fice will change, says Mr Si­mon Piff, vice-pres­i­dent for prac­tice group at IDC. “I don’t think the post-Covid-19 fu­ture is one where ev­ery­one nec­es­sar­ily works from home.”</p>
    <p>Although peo­ple are cer­tainly pro­duc­tive at home, re­search shows that many work­ers are miss­ing so­cial in­ter­ac­tions with their col­leagues, and com­pany lead­ers are con­cerned about the lack of “can­teen chat­ter” that drives many so­cial work­ing groups, ideas and cross-team col­lab­o­ra­tion, he adds.</p>
    <p>Rather, he be­lieves the fu­ture is one of “ex­treme mo­bil­ity”, where peo­ple can work from any lo­ca­tion, whether from home, an of­fice, a cafe or a beach.</p>
    <p>“As this pe­riod has shown, the need to be tied to an of­fice has van­ished. So, as long as you are pro­duc­tive, why should it mat­ter where you work from?”</p>
