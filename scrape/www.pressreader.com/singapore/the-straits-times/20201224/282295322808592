    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES The Los An­ge­les Lak­ers sure did not have long to savour their 17th Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) ti­tle.</p>
    <p>A lit­tle more than two months af­ter they locked up last sea­son’s crown by beat­ing the Mi­ami Heat in the Fi­nals, they were brought back down to earth in a 116-109 loss to ri­vals Los An­ge­les Clip­pers on the open­ing night of the new cam­paign on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Paul Ge­orge led the Clip­pers, less than two weeks af­ter ink­ing a fouryear con­tract ex­ten­sion worth US$226 mil­lion (US$301.6 mil­lion), at the Sta­ples Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The All-Star scored 26 of his 33 points in the sec­ond half as his team kept the cham­pi­ons at bay.</p>
    <p>“I got into a good rhythm mak­ing plays for the team,” Ge­orge said. “That’s how I catch fire – I let the game come to me. I took the shots when they were avail­able.”</p>
    <p>Kawhi Leonard added 26 points for the Clip­pers, who are out to ex­punge the mem­ory of their ag­o­nis­ing Western Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nal loss to the Den­ver Nuggets, who trailed 3-1 but won in seven games.</p>
    <p>Ge­orge drew plenty of de­ri­sion for fail­ing to live up to his “Play­off P” nick­name, but new Clip­pers coach Ty­ronn Lue be­lieves the for­ward can be “un­stop­pable” if his mind­set is right.</p>
    <p>Leonard, last year’s Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player, has also sensed an at­ti­tude shift in Ge­orge, say­ing: “We are not think­ing about (last sea­son). It’s a dif­fer­ent team.</p>
    <p>“In the play-offs when he was miss­ing shots, he (Ge­orge) was still talk­ing, com­mu­ni­cat­ing, play­ing the right way, play­ing de­fence.</p>
    <p>“They just didn’t fall for him. And tonight, his shots fell but ob­vi­ously, he is mak­ing my job eas­ier by talk­ing to peo­ple, giv­ing in­struc­tions on missed as­sign­ments or if we’re not run­ning the plays right.”</p>
    <p>Fi­nals MVP LeBron James led the Lak­ers with 22 points, while</p>
    <p>team­mates An­thony Davis had 18 and Dennis Schroder – a new ad­di­tion – scored 14 points with 12 re­bounds and eight as­sists.</p>
    <p>The night started with a bang as the Lak­ers re­ceived their di­a­mond and amethyst en­crusted cham­pi­onship rings. There were no fans in at­ten­dance, but fam­ily mem­bers –</p>
    <p>and some front-line health­care work­ers who are Lak­ers fans – de­liv­ered heart­felt recorded mes­sages of con­grat­u­la­tions to the team be­fore the game.</p>
    <p>But they were on the back foot early, trail­ing from start to fin­ish in a game the Clip­pers led by as many as 22 points in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“The game comes quick, and you’ve got to get fo­cused,” Lak­ers coach Frank Vo­gel said of shift­ing gears af­ter the ring cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>“It’s just weird in all facets,” said James, who turned an an­kle in the fourth quar­ter, about the over­rid­ing feel­ing of the day.</p>
    <p>“Cel­e­brat­ing an his­toric mo­ment</p>
    <p>with our fran­chise and hav­ing to do it with­out our fam­ily and friends and our fans, it’s just a weird day to say the least.”</p>
    <p>He added of the re­sult: “It’s game one, it’s the first test for us. We’ve lit­er­ally been to­gether for nine days as a full group.”</p>
