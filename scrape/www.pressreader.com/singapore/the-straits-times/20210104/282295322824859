    <p>NEG­A­TIVE AS­SO­CI­A­TION</p>
    <p>The first time that Mr Ed­uardo Sam­paio saw an oc­to­pus curl one of its arms and punch a fish, he said he “burst out laugh­ing”. That was a prob­lem be­cause he was scuba div­ing in the Red Sea and nearly choked on his div­ing reg­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>While an oc­to­pus punch­ing a fish has been seen be­fore, the con­text was new. The oc­to­pus that Mr Sam­paio ob­served was hunt­ing for food along­side other ma­rine crea­tures, and this was the first time any­one had seen an oc­to­pus punch thrown dur­ing such be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam­paio and his co-au­thors have pub­lished their ob­ser­va­tions of sev­eral oc­to­pus bul­lies in the jour­nal Ecol­ogy. They hope their re­search will help re­veal the dy­nam­ics among these an­i­mal groups, which may bal­ance their com­pet­ing in­ter­ests through sub­tle – and less sub­tle – ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Oc­to­puses are known to be soli­tary preda­tors. But, some­times, one will take part in an un­der­sea hunt­ing party, trav­el­ling with fish of sev­eral species that are also look­ing for a meal.</p>
    <p>Study­ing this ac­tiv­ity is part of Mr Sam­paio’s doc­toral re­search at the Univer­sity of Lis­bon in Por­tu­gal and the Max Planck In­sti­tute of An­i­mal Be­hav­iour in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Al­though the an­i­mals hunt to­gether, Mr Sam­paio is care­ful not to call it co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The group me­chan­ics are not well un­der­stood, but the an­i­mals seem to do dif­fer­ent jobs.</p>
    <p>While an oc­to­pus probes rock and coral crevices, cer­tain fish may pa­trol the sea floor, and oth­ers may wait in the wa­ter above. Some fish may just be moochers.</p>
    <p>But, in other cases, fish may work to­gether more di­rectly with oc­to­puses. Re­searchers have seen groupers and coral trout, when their prey hides in a crevice, do a shim­my­ing head­stand over the spot. This seems to sig­nal part­ners, in­clud­ing oc­to­puses, which then come over and use their flex­i­ble bod­ies to flush out the prey.</p>
    <p>In these hunts, Mr Sam­paio said, it is ben­e­fi­cial for both the fish and the oc­to­pus that the part­ner is there. Some­times, though, the oc­to­pus would like a part­ner to be a bit far­ther away. That is when it de­liv­ers a punch.</p>
    <p>These punches are not com­mon, Mr Sam­paio said. He recorded about eight ex­am­ples dur­ing three months of dives in the Red Sea.</p>
    <p>In some cases, there was a clear rea­son for the ag­gres­sion. An oc­to­pus knocked a fish out of the way to grab prey. At other times, it was not im­me­di­ately clear what a fish had done to de­serve a punch.</p>
    <p>Maybe launch­ing a fish to the pe­riph­ery of the hunt­ing group teaches it a lesson, like not to steal from the oc­to­pus. An­other pos­si­bil­ity is that the punch­ing may be a learned re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“The sim­plest ex­pla­na­tion here is that the oc­to­puses might have neg­a­tively as­so­ci­ated los­ing a prey item with hav­ing a fish fol­low them around,” said Univer­sity of Cam­bridge com­par­a­tive psy­chol­o­gist Alexan­dra Schnell, who stud­ies cephalo­pod in­tel­li­gence and was not in­volved in the re­search.</p>
    <p>Dr Schnell also said she was not con­vinced that the oc­to­puses and reef fish were work­ing to­gether dur­ing these multi-species hunts.</p>
    <p>“There is no doubt that this is won­der­ful footage,” she added, but what is vis­i­ble to the hu­man eye in the Red Sea videos “is only one piece of the puz­zle”.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam­paio is do­ing more anal­y­sis of those videos. Like a foren­sic sci­en­tist re­con­struct­ing a crime scene, he is build­ing 3D mod­els of how all the an­i­mals move within a hunt­ing group.</p>
    <p>He wants to learn more about the net­work of in­ter­ac­tions: Who is lead­ing and who is fol­low­ing? Where does the oc­to­pus look for in­for­ma­tion? And does a punch change the be­hav­iour of a fish?</p>
    <p>Mr Sam­paio said he does not think that oc­to­puses punch at ran­dom, be­cause the main drive of an­i­mals is to eat.</p>
    <p>“So when that comes into play, the gloves come off.” NY­TIMES</p>
    <p>The sim­plest ex­pla­na­tion here is that the oc­to­puses might have neg­a­tively as­so­ci­ated los­ing a prey item with hav­ing a fish fol­low them around.</p>
