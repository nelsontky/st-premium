    <p>STEPANAKER­T (Azer­bai­jan) • A can­dle lights the strained faces of civil­ians hud­dled in the base­ment of the Holy Mother of God Cathe­dral in Nagorno-Karabakh’s main city Stepanaker­t, where they have sought refuge from fight­ing that erupted a week ago over the dis­puted re­gion.</p>
    <p>Sun­day starts qui­etly, but soon there are air raid sirens break­ing the si­lence.</p>
    <p>For the peo­ple who live near the cathe­dral af­fil­i­ated with the Ar­me­nian Apos­tolic Church, it is the ideal shel­ter.</p>
    <p>“It is prob­a­bly the safest place in Stepanaker­t, pro­tected by the gran­ite and by Our Lord,” said a burly priest, wear­ing a black robe and cam­ou­flage vest.</p>
    <p>He is calm as he or­gan­ises space for the refugees, ham­pered by fre­quent power cuts.</p>
    <p>The vast un­der­ground hall is ringed by chapels serv­ing as tem­po­rary homes for fam­i­lies grouped around mat­tresses cov­ered with thick, multi-coloured blan­kets.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been here three days,” mur­mured Ms Go­har, hold­ing oneyear-old An­gelina in her arms.</p>
    <p>Women of all ages try to help the chil­dren pass the time.</p>
    <p>“The men are at the front,” Ms Go­har said be­fore sob­bing: “I learnt yes­ter­day that a friend of mine who was 23 had died.”</p>
    <p>She has had no news of her brother, who joined in the new fight­ing, the heav­i­est in decades that has so far claimed nearly 250 lives, in­clud­ing nearly 40 civil­ians.</p>
    <p>Ms Go­har is not pre­pared to flee Karabakh, the home­land she refers to by its Ar­me­nian name, Art­sakh. “We just hope that all this will end in a few days.”</p>
    <p>But sev­eral fam­i­lies left last Satur­day for the Ar­me­nian cap­i­tal Yere­van.</p>
    <p>Some of the refugees leave the sanc­tu­ary dur­ing lulls in the fight­ing or un­der cover of dark­ness to go home to col­lect food or cloth­ing. Food is in abun­dant sup­ply, how­ever, do­nated in Yere­van and taken to Stepanaker­t by vol­un­teers, as­so­ci­a­tions or just con­cerned in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>No mass was cel­e­brated this Sun­day given the fraught cli­mate, though a few faith­ful chanted brief pray­ers in the nave, fac­ing banks of empty pews.</p>
    <p>An el­derly woman wear­ing a black veil could be seen recit­ing the rosary be­fore bow­ing to an icon in a cloud of in­cense.</p>
    <p>A group of men, some in uni­form, wait un­der the por­tico be­fore the cathe­dral’s sculpted wooden doors, scan­ning the clouds and dis­cussing the lat­est from the front.</p>
    <p>“We will never let the en­emy get in very deep,” said one of the priests, hold­ing a gold cru­ci­fix. “We are here on the his­tor­i­cal land of Ar­me­nian Chris­tian­ity.”</p>
    <p>The air raid sirens sound once more, first far off, then closer. Ev­ery­one scram­bles in­side and down to the base­ment.</p>
    <p>A minute later, ex­plo­sions ring out. Grey smoke rises from build­ings in the dis­tance.</p>
    <p>“Those are Grads,” said one man, re­fer­ring to a truck-mounted rocket launcher. He is a vet­eran of the con­flict that first broke out in 1988 and claimed some 30,000 lives.</p>
