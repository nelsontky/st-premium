    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Airbnb has re­sumed its ef­forts to go pub­lic, de­spite sig­nif­i­cant dam­age to the home ren­tal busi­ness caused by Covid-19, Airbnb chief ex­ec­u­tive Brian Ch­esky told em­ploy­ees on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The San Fran­cisco com­pany, once valued by in­vestors at US$31 bil­lion (S$43.2 bil­lion), had planned to file in March to go pub­lic, but set aside those plans when the pan­demic halted travel around the world. Since then, Airbnb has slashed costs, raised emer­gency fund­ing and laid off a quar­ter of its staff, around 1,900 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>On a video­con­fer­ence with em­ploy­ees, Mr Ch­esky in­di­cated that the com­pany’s gross book­ings – a sum that in­cludes money paid to hosts – had re­bounded in re­cent weeks from their nose-dive.</p>
    <p>“This is some­thing I never would have imag­ined telling you,” he said in the meet­ing. “It kind of de­fies logic in a way.” He added that the trend could change as lock­downs re­turned i n some parts of the United States.</p>
    <p>Airbnb also an­nounced that Ms Cather­ine Pow­ell, the com­pany’s head of ex­pe­ri­ences, would take a new role as global head of host­ing as Mr Greg Gree­ley, pres­i­dent of the homes divi­sion, left the com­pany. Mr Hiroki Asai, an 18-year vet­eran of Ap­ple, will join Airbnb to lead its mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Airbnb is try­ing to re­pair its re­la­tion­ship with its hosts, who sup­ply the rentals for its plat­form and whose in­come has dried up with travel halted. Many were out­raged when Airbnb al­lowed guests to can­cel non-re­fund­able book­ings as the pan­demic spread. Mr Ch­esky ear­lier apol­o­gised to hosts for how the de­ci­sion was com­mu­ni­cated.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the virus, Airbnb has adapted its of­fer­ings, in­clud­ing cre­at­ing new clean­ing ini­tia­tives, sell­ing ac­cess to “vir­tual” ac­tiv­i­ties done over video stream­ing and pro­mot­ing rentals in ru­ral ar­eas within driv­ing dis­tance.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is un­der pres­sure from its work­ers to go pub­lic; shares held by early em­ploy­ees will be­gin to ex­pire this year.</p>
    <p>Even with the rev­enue it lost, Airbnb’s list­ing may be wel­comed by in­vestors.</p>
    <p>De­spite record unemployme­nt and surg­ing virus cases, the stock mar­ket has been boom­ing, par­tic­u­larly for ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings by tech com­pa­nies. In re­cent weeks, shares of Lemonade, an on­line in­sur­ance start-up, and NCino, a fi­nan­cial tech start-up, have more than dou­bled af­ter list­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ch­esky closed the meet­ing by declar­ing that Airbnb is back.</p>
    <p>“We’re not com­mit­ting to go­ing pub­lic this year, but we’re not rul­ing it out ei­ther,” he said. “When the mar­ket is ready, we will be ready, be­cause Airbnb was down but we were not out.”</p>
