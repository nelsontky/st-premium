    <p>More than 500 stall­hold­ers, stall as­sis­tants and clean­ers work­ing at se­lected hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops in the Ma­rine Pa­rade area, along with food de­liv­ery per­son­nel, re­ceived free Covid-19 swab tests yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency, the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore said in a joint state­ment that by the end of this week­end’s tests today, around 980 peo­ple are ex­pected to be swabbed at two lo­ca­tions – the pav­il­ion be­side Block 75 Ma­rine Drive and the open plaza in front of Block 50A Ma­rine Ter­race.</p>
    <p>Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC MP Tan See Leng told re­porters at the Ma­rine Drive site yes­ter­day morn­ing that feed­back from the test­ing “has been very good”.</p>
    <p>“A cou­ple of them ac­tu­ally came up to me and said that (the test­ing) is a good ex­er­cise be­cause what they are con­cerned about is re­ally their liveli­hood,” said Dr Tan, who is also Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power and Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to the im­pact of Covid-19 on the mer­chants, whose in­come had been hit dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan was ac­com­pa­nied by Te­masek chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Ching and Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, who is also a for­mer prime min­is­ter and MP for Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC.</p>
    <p>The week­end tests are part of a larger ini­tia­tive that the Health Min­istry had an­nounced on Aug 29, which in­volves of­fer­ing one-time poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests to com­mu­nity groups, such as taxi and pri­vate-hire car driv­ers, as well as food de­liv­ery per­son­nel who have fre­quent in­ter­ac­tion with the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>It added that the tests are car­ried out to pro­vide a bet­ter pic­ture of the preva­lence of the virus among the pop­u­la­tion at large.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said he hoped the num­ber of pos­i­tive re­sults from the week­end tests will be “very, very, very low” as that will re­store “a sig­nif­i­cant amount of con­fi­dence to peo­ple vis­it­ing our hawker cen­tres, wet mar­kets and cof­fee shops”.</p>
    <p>Hawk­ers, stall­hold­ers and food de­liv­ery riders whom The Sun­day Times spoke to at Ma­rine Drive said that tak­ing the swab tests gave them peace of mind, and was a good safety pre­cau­tion in the light of the on­go­ing out­break.</p>
    <p>GrabFood de­liv­ery driver Ra­madan Taslim, 26, who lives near Ma­rine Ter­race, de­cided to head down for a swab test as a safety pre­cau­tion, given his high fre­quency of con­tact with the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“I typ­i­cally do around 140 de­liv­er­ies a week, though about 25 per cent of th­ese are con­tact­less ones. None­the­less, it’s a good chance to take the test since I live nearby,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Lee Chye, 74, and his wife, Madam Yeo Swee Chin, 67, who are stall own­ers sell­ing kitchen uten­sils at the Block 84 Ma­rine Pa­rade Cen­tral mar­ket, com­pleted their tests at around 11am yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s a free test, so there’s re­ally no harm go­ing, even though we feel healthy and well. It’s good to get the ad­di­tional re­as­sur­ance,” said Mr Lim in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some stall own­ers said they were not aware of the on­go­ing tests tak­ing place over the week­end, although The Sun­day Times un­der­stands that a no­tice in­form­ing them of the swab tests had been given out a week ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Vic­tor Thya, hon­orary sec­re­tary of the Ma­rine Pa­rade Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tion, said: “Our lo­cal mer­chants and hawk­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tions have been strongly urg­ing all our hawk­ers and cof­fee shop own­ers to get their swabs done, and the re­sponse has been good so far, many of whom have been very re­cep­tive to this ini­tia­tive.”</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion has reached out to work­ers at seven se­lected cof­fee shops, as well as three hawker cen­tres and mar­kets at Block 84 Ma­rine Pa­rade Cen­tral, Block 50A Ma­rine Ter­race and Dun­man Food Cen­tre.</p>
