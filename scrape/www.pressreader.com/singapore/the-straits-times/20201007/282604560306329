    <p>One morn­ing, my son said his Alexa had started talk­ing to him in the mid­dle of the night... It made me think of those clas­sic ghost sto­ries, where some­body’s walk­ing down the hall, he hears his kid talk­ing to some­body, and when he asks who it is, the kid says no­body.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine if the vir­tual as­sis­tant soft­ware that shops and searches the In­ter­net for you, plays your favourite mu­sic and con­trols your smart de­vices, de­cided to try and kill you.</p>
    <p>That is the jump­ing-off point of the sci­ence-fic­tion drama Next, which de­buts to­day at 9pm on Fox (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 330 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 505) and Fox+.</p>
    <p>John Slat­tery (Mad Men, 2007 to 2015) stars as a tech­nol­ogy bil­lion­aire who re­alises the pow­er­ful ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) he cre­ated may have malev­o­lent in­ten­tions to­wards him and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the press in Los An­ge­les, Slat­tery and the show’s cre­ator, Manny Coto, con­fess their grow­ing techno-para­noia and alarm at how AI and other dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies are en­croach­ing on the world.</p>
    <p>Coto – who pro­duced sev­eral sea­sons of the hit counter-ter­ror­ism show 24 and its spin-off se­ries (2006 to 2017) – was in­spired by a couple of un­nerv­ing in­ci­dents in­volv­ing smart de­vices in his home.</p>
    <p>“We have a lot of Alexas in the house. I have four kids, and the girls have one in their room, my son has one in his room, and I have one in my room,” says the 59-year-old.</p>
    <p>“One morn­ing, my son said his Alexa had started talk­ing to him in the mid­dle of the night. And it hap­pened again when he had a bunch of friends sleep over. At 4am, they said Alexa woke them up.</p>
    <p>“It made me think of those clas­sic ghost sto­ries, where some­body’s walk­ing down the hall, he hears his kid talk­ing to some­body, and when</p>
    <p>NEXT’S CRE­ATOR, MANNY COTO</p>
    <p>he asks who it is, the kid says no­body.”</p>
    <p>Coto then did a bit of re­search and saw that many ex­perts be­lieve that ad­vanced AI – one that de­vel­ops “ar­ti­fi­cial gen­eral in­tel­li­gence”, mean­ing it can learn and un­der­stand any task a hu­man can, but can do it bet­ter – could even­tu­ally pose an ex­is­ten­tial threat to mankind.</p>
    <p>“I saw that peo­ple like Elon Musk, Bill Gates and a num­ber of sci­en­tists were warn­ing about the pos­si­bil­ity of a su­per-in­tel­li­gent AI aris­ing,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Tesla chief ex­ec­u­tive and Mi­crosoft founder re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“It’s no longer just sci­ence fic­tion, ev­ery­body’s chas­ing af­ter it, we’re get­ting closer and closer to cre­at­ing it, and it could be ex­tremely dan­ger­ous, so we need to take pre­cau­tions now.”</p>
    <p>The idea of malev­o­lent AI has been ex­plored on-screen, but Coto wanted to tackle the topic more re­al­is­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>“How would it re­ally go down: Would there be killer ro­bots? Would there be nu­clear ex­plo­sions? Prob­a­bly not, from what I read. It would be much more sub­tle.”</p>
    <p>Hence the premise of the show, which fol­lows Sil­i­con Val­ley mogul Paul LeBlanc (Slat­tery) as he tries to shut down neXt, the AI he cre­ated, only to be kicked out of his com­pany by his brother Ted (Jason</p>
    <p>But­ler Harner).</p>
    <p>But the threat the sys­tem poses is not ob­vi­ous to any­one ex­cept a hand­ful of peo­ple in the first sea­son, whom the AI tries to at­tack and si­lence.</p>
    <p>“That’s one of the things I re­searched. In a lot of sce­nar­ios, it would prob­a­bly try to play dumb be­cause it would know we’d be afraid of it, so it would not want any­one to know it ex­isted un­til it got into a po­si­tion where it didn’t have to play dumb,” Coto says.</p>
    <p>Slat­tery, 58, also won­ders how many jobs ad­vanced AI will even­tu­ally re­place.</p>
    <p>“My son’s 20 and he just de­clared his ma­jor (at univer­sity) as a graphic artist and did a se­mes­ter study­ing graphic de­sign. And it’s all com­puter gen­er­ated.”</p>
    <p>Given how per­va­sive dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy has be­come in peo­ple’s lives, the ac­tor – who starred in the Os­car-win­ning drama Spot­light (2015) – now makes a con­scious ef­fort to un­plug from time to time.</p>
    <p>“I go surf­ing and med­i­tate,” he says. “But the scari­est moment is when your phone tells you how long you’ve been on it that week. I don’t even look at that be­cause I’m afraid.</p>
    <p>Next de­buts to­day at 9pm on Fox (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 330 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 505) and Fox+.</p>
