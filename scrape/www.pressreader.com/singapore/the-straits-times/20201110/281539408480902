    <p>The zeit­geist of the world is in­fused by the char­ac­ter of the United States leader. Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den (left) will bring back the ci­vil­ity and generosity that the Amer­i­can spirit is as­so­ci­ated with, says Mr Kishore Mah­bubani.</p>
    <p>So what does the elec­tion of Joe Bi­den bring to the world? Will good times re­turn? The short an­swer is yes and no. Mr Bi­den is a truly de­cent hu­man be­ing. He will bring back the ci­vil­ity and generosity that the Amer­i­can spirit is as­so­ci­ated with. How­ever, Mr Bi­den also knows that he is tak­ing over a deeply di­vided coun­try.</p>
    <p>The first Amer­i­can pres­i­dent to en­ter my per­sonal con­scious­ness was John F. Kennedy. It wasn’t his stir­ring rhetoric that reached me as a child in Sin­ga­pore. It was the news of his as­sas­si­na­tion. The sense of loss was glob­ally pal­pa­ble. His­tory has been kind to him.</p>
    <p>He was suc­ceeded by Lyn­don Baines Johnson. As a child, I was puz­zled. How could some­one so ugly suc­ceed some­one who was so at­trac­tive? In­deed, he was boor­ish. Leg­end has it that he would sum­mon his staff to meet­ings while sit­ting on his toi­let seat, do­ing his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Still, his­tory will be kind to him. His bold and mas­sive civil rights leg­is­la­tion changed the course of US his­tory. Which may ex­plain why he has the most vo­lu­mi­nous and still un­fin­ished biog­ra­phy of any re­cent Amer­i­can pres­i­dent, in the four vol­umes by Robert Caro.</p>
    <p>His­tory has been un­kind to Richard Nixon, his suc­ces­sor. Water­gate killed him. The lib­eral me­dia has not for­given him. Yet there’s no doubt that he changed the course of hu­man his­tory. With­out Mr Nixon, Henry Kissinger could not have gone to China.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew named Mr Nixon as the great­est Amer­i­can pres­i­dent he had met, say­ing: “But for the mis­for­tune of Water­gate, I would say Richard Nixon. He had a re­al­is­tic view of the world. He was a great an­a­lyst, re­al­is­tic, but also a tac­ti­cian to get things done.”</p>
    <p>When Mr Nixon stepped down, Mr Lee lost a true friend in the White House, a ma­jor as­set for the leader of a small coun­try.</p>
    <p>This par­tially ex­plained the con­tempt Mr Lee had for Jimmy Carter, whom he con­sid­ered naive. In Tom Plate’s book, Gi­ants Of Asia: Con­ver­sa­tions With Lee Kuan Yew, Mr Lee named Mr Carter the worst pres­i­dent, say­ing of him: “Your job as a leader is to in­spire and to gal­vanise, not to share your dis­traught thoughts.</p>
    <p>You make your peo­ple dispir­ited.”</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, Mr Carter was suc­ceeded by the two-term Ron­ald Rea­gan, an­other ad­mirer of Mr Lee. I was present when they met in the White House. Still, as a Sin­ga­pore diplo­mat in Wash­ing­ton and New York dur­ing Mr Rea­gan’s era, I ex­pe­ri­enced the con­de­scen­sion the lib­eral me­dia dis­played to­wards him. How­ever, his­tory has been very kind to Mr Rea­gan, es­pe­cially be­cause of his spec­tac­u­lar vic­tory over the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>Mr Rea­gan was suc­ceeded by an­other great friend and ad­mirer of Mr Lee, Ge­orge H. W. Bush. I was present in a small room in St Peters­burg, Rus­sia, in the late 1990s, when Mr Bush con­firmed that the No. 1 leader he ad­mired in the world was Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>I re­ported this to him. Sadly, Mr Bush be­came a one-term pres­i­dent, and his de­par­ture was an­other huge blow to Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>The point of th­ese stories is a sim­ple one. The se­lec­tion of an Amer­i­can pres­i­dent has huge con­se­quences for the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>WHAT BI­DEN OF­FERS</p>
    <p>In­deed, given the over­whelm­ing power of Amer­ica, es­pe­cially in the me­dia and com­mu­ni­ca­tion di­men­sions, the zeit­geist of the world is in­fused by the char­ac­ter and per­son­al­ity of the Amer­i­can pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Don­ald Trump’s nar­cis­sis­tic and self-ab­sorbed per­son­al­ity has de­prived the world of a ma­jor source of in­spi­ra­tion, es­pe­cially af­ter Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>So what does the elec­tion of Joe Bi­den bring to the world? Will good times re­turn? The short an­swer is yes and no.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is a truly de­cent hu­man be­ing. He will bring back the ci­vil­ity and generosity that the Amer­i­can spirit is as­so­ci­ated with.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Bi­den also knows that he is tak­ing over a deeply di­vided coun­try, as demon­strated by the huge num­bers who voted for Mr Trump even though he was de­feated. His pri­or­ity is to heal his coun­try, not cre­ate a bet­ter world.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, Mr Bi­den has at least three op­por­tu­ni­ties he can cap­i­talise on to re­tain his pos­i­tive glow.</p>
    <p>First, he can bring back some bore­dom to the White House. Both Amer­ica and the world have be­come ex­hausted by Mr Trump’s tweets and in-your-face pres­ence. Some calm and ret­i­cence by the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will help to re­turn the world to a cer­tain de­gree of nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den knows that he can­not do this alone. For­tu­nately, he has as­sem­bled a for­mi­da­ble tran­si­tional team of real Amer­i­can heavy­weights. They share Mr Bi­den’s dis­tress over the di­vi­sions in the coun­try. Re­pair­ing the wounds in Amer­i­can so­ci­ety and bring­ing back a happy Amer­ica will be the main pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond op­por­tu­nity is geopo­lit­i­cal. Mr Bi­den can­not re­verse the US-China geopo­lit­i­cal con­test, for rea­sons I have doc­u­mented in my book, Has China Won? He would be per­se­cuted if he is seen to be soft on China. Yet, even if he can­not re­verse course on China, he can press the pause but­ton on the con­test.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans be­lieve in com­mon sense. Sim­ple com­mon sense would say that Amer­i­cans should first deal with the press­ing chal­lenges of Covid-19 and eco­nomic slow­down, not to men­tion global warm­ing.</p>
    <p>All th­ese prob­lems would be bet­ter han­dled with some de­gree of co­op­er­a­tion with China. Just as Win­ston Churchill part­nered an ad­ver­sary, Joseph Stalin, to de­feat Adolf Hitler, Mr Bi­den can part­ner a com­peti­tor, China, to de­feat Covid-19. Both Mr Nixon and Mr Lee would have ap­proved such a Machi­avel­lian ma­noeu­vre against a com­mon foe.</p>
    <p>The third op­por­tu­nity lies in stop­ping Amer­ica’s drift to­wards a plu­toc­racy. One key rea­son why Mr Trump was elected in 2016 was be­cause of the “sea of de­spair” among the white work­ing classes. This is be­cause Amer­ica is the only ma­jor de­vel­oped econ­omy where the av­er­age in­come of the bot­tom 50 per cent has gone down. The an­guish of th­ese white work­ing classes must be dealt with. Some re­dis­tri­bu­tion must take place.</p>
    <p>Mr Rea­gan dele­git­imised taxes. Mr Bi­den must re-le­git­imise them. And, if Amer­ica’s many plu­to­crats are wise, they would sup­port him.</p>
    <p>In short, Mr Bi­den can ap­ply some gen­tle sooth­ing balm on the many wounds gen­er­ated by the Trump pres­i­dency. His great­est as­set is his de­cency. Plain de­cency will bring a lot of heal­ing to Amer­ica. Mr Trump may have been cruel to call him “Sleepy Joe”. Yet a “Sleepy Joe” and calm Amer­i­can pres­i­dency may be good for Amer­ica and the world.</p>
