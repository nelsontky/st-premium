    <p>A bid­ding war has erupted over a widely-read story from The New York Times, ti­tled She Stalked Her Daugh­ter’s Killers Across Mex­ico, One By One, as pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies in Hol­ly­wood fight to adapt the tragic, en­thralling tale.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an ex­clu­sive re­port from en­ter­tain­ment trade pub­li­ca­tion The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter, more than 16 pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies are seek­ing the screen rights to the Dec 13 ar­ti­cle, writ­ten by in­ves­tiga­tive jour­nal­ist Azam Ahmed.</p>
    <p>Six-fig­ure of­fers have re­port­edly been made.</p>
    <p>The piece told the story of a mother named Miriam Ro­driguez in Mex­ico, whose 20-year-old daugh­ter was kid­napped and later mur­dered by a Mex­i­can car­tel in 2014.</p>
    <p>Armed with a hand­gun, she took on false iden­ti­ties and trawled so­cial me­dia to hunt down those re­spon­si­ble for her daugh­ter’s bru­tal end.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ro­driguez’s story was jux­ta­posed against the kid­nap­ping and mur­der of a 14-year-old boy this year.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies fight­ing for the screen rights for this tale are said to in­clude HBO’s doc­u­men­tary di­vi­sion, Ch­ernin En­ter­tain­ment (The Great­est Show­man, 2017), Mak­eready (Queen & Slim, 2019) and Thun­der Road (John Wick, 2014).</p>
    <p>The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter said most pro­duc­tion houses were seek­ing to adapt the story as a se­ries rather than a film. The New York Times will act as pro­ducer on the even­tual adap­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, pro­duc­tion houses have eyed long-form jour­nal­ism pieces for tele­vi­sion and film.</p>
    <p>Last year’s crime drama Hus­tlers was based on New York mag­a­zine’s 2015 ar­ti­cle, The Hus­tlers At Scores, by Jes­sica Pressler.</p>
    <p>In­vent­ing Anna, Net­flix’s up­com­ing minis­eries about the high­so­ci­ety scam­mer “Anna Delvey”, whose real name is Anna Sorokin, is based on the 2018 New York Mag­a­zine ar­ti­cle, How Anna Delvey Tricked New York’s Party Peo­ple, also writ­ten by Pressler.</p>
