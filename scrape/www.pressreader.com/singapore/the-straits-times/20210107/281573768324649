    <p>The fam­ily of Sin­ga­pore’s rich­est bil­lion­aire, a co-founder of hot­pot chain Haidi­lao, is buy­ing a free­hold good class bun­ga­low (GCB) in Gal­lop Road at the high­est price per sq ft for the area. Ac­cord­ing to doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times, the op­tion to pur­chase the bun­ga­low was granted to Mr Zhang Hanzhi at $42 mil­lion on Dec 22.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily of Sin­ga­pore’s rich­est bil­lion­aire, the co-founder of Sichuan hot­pot chain Haidi­lao, is buy­ing a free­hold good class bun­ga­low (GCB) in Gal­lop Road at the high­est price per sq ft (psf) for the area.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times, the op­tion to pur­chase the 21,649 sq ft bun­ga­low, lo­cated a stone’s throw from the Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens, was granted to Mr Zhang Hanzhi at $42 mil­lion on Dec 22.</p>
    <p>This works out to $1,940 psf, which an­a­lysts say is the high­est price psf paid for a GCB in that area.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang Hanzhi is the son of Mr Zhang Yong, the chair­man of Haidi­lao In­ter­na­tional Hold­ing, which went pub­lic in Hong Kong in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang Yong, a nat­u­ralised Sin­ga­pore ci­ti­zen, topped Forbes’ Sin­ga­pore’s Rich­est list last year for the sec­ond straight year.</p>
    <p>He has a com­bined net worth of US$19 bil­lion (S$25.02 bil­lion) with his wife Shu Ping, co-founder and direc­tor of Haidi­lao. She made the Forbes’ list last year as well.</p>
    <p>The Gal­lop Road prop­erty is lo­cated next to Mr Zhang Yong’s ex­ist­ing bun­ga­low, which was pur­chased at $1,700 psf or $27 mil­lion in 2016.</p>
    <p>Dubbed The Winged House, the 15,884 sq ft free­hold bun­ga­low was de­signed by K2LD Ar­chi­tects in the shape of two wings.</p>
    <p>Ms Carin Puah, se­nior direc­tor (cap­i­tal mar­kets) of real es­tate agency JLL Sin­ga­pore, said $1,940 psf was a record price for the Gal­lop Road area last year.</p>
    <p>She added: “They are pay­ing for the pri­vacy of the lo­ca­tion as both bun­ga­lows are lo­cated in a cul de sac.”</p>
    <p>But Ms Puah also noted there were at least three GCB trans­ac­tions in other ar­eas that were done at $2,000 psf and above last year.</p>
    <p>Re­cent trans­ac­tions within the GCB ar­eas in­clude a Cluny Hill bun­ga­low, which was trans­acted at $38.6 mil­lion or $2,315 psf.</p>
    <p>A GCB in Chatsworth Park was trans­acted last month at $44 mil­lion, which trans­lates to $2,082 psf based on land area, and a bun­ga­low in Ler­mit Road was sold for $34.75 mil­lion or $2,000 psf.</p>
    <p>“There’s mar­ket talk that the fam­ily were look­ing for a big­ger plot GCB, but sup­ply is lim­ited... Most GCB buy­ers like to buy the 21,000 sq ft and larger plots, as you can build up to 17,000 sq ft,” Mr Sa­muel Eyo, manag­ing direc­tor of Light­house Prop­erty Con­sul­tants, said in ref­er­ence to Mr Zhang Yong and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Bun­ga­lows in the 39 gazetted GCB ar­eas are the most pres­ti­gious form of landed hous­ing in Sin­ga­pore, with strict plan­ning con­di­tions stip­u­lated by the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity to pre­serve their ex­clu­siv­ity and low-rise char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket watch­ers say bun­ga­low ac­tiv­ity and sen­ti­ment have im­proved as some in­dus­tries – par­tic­u­larly those in e-com­merce and tech­nol­ogy – have done well amid the pan­demic, and as more for­eign­ers are set­ting up fam­ily of­fices here, which bodes well for GCB de­mand.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg, Ms Shu Ping, the sole share­holder and direc­tor of Sun­rise Cap­i­tal Man­age­ment, has opened a fam­ily of­fice in Sin­ga­pore to help man­age her wealth.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily of­fices are busi­nesses cre­ated to run the fi­nances of the world’s su­per rich, pro­vid­ing dis­cre­tion and per­son­alised ser­vices be­yond those of­fered by pri­vate banks.</p>
