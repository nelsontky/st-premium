    <p>MUM­BAI • San­jay Dutt, one of Bol­ly­wood’s top stars, said on Wed­nes­day he had emerged “vic­to­ri­ous” after be­ing di­ag­nosed with cancer ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“Today, on the oc­ca­sion of my kids’ birth­day, I am happy to come out vic­to­ri­ous from this bat­tle and be able to give them the best gift I can – the health and well-be­ing of our fam­ily”, he said on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“My heart is filled with grat­i­tude as I share this news with all of you today,” the 61-year-old star said, one week after con­firm­ing the di­ag­no­sis. He gave no other de­tails of his treat­ment.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, he said he was “tak­ing a short break for some med­i­cal treat­ment”, trig­ger­ing weeks of me­dia spec­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The actor, nick­named Deadly Dutt, is one of Bol­ly­wood’s most bank­able and most con­tro­ver­sial names.</p>
    <p>He shot to fame in a string of 1980s ac­tion movies in which he per­formed his own stunts.</p>
    <p>But the star also strug­gled with sub­stance abuse, in­clud­ing heroin and co­caine, said to have been sparked by the pain of los­ing his mother, In­dian screen icon Nar­gis Dutt, to cancer in 1981.</p>
    <p>He re­turned to make more hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s in­clud­ing Jeete Hain Shaan Se (We Live With Style, 1988), Saa­jan (Beloved, 1991) and Khal Nayak (Vil­lain, 1993).</p>
    <p>His life took a dra­matic turn when he was ar­rested fol­low­ing the Mum­bai bomb­ings in March 1993 that killed 257 peo­ple. He was con­victed in 2006 of pos­sess­ing guns sup­plied by mafia bosses who car­ried out the blasts. The at­tacks were be­lieved to have been staged by Mus­lim un­der­world fig­ures in re­tal­i­a­tion against re­li­gious ri­ots in which mainly Mus­lims died.</p>
    <p>He was given a six-year term and spent 18 months in prison be­fore be­ing re­leased in 2007, pend­ing an ap­peal. In 2013, his con­vic­tion was up­held but his prison term was cut to five years. He was re­leased in 2016.</p>
    <p>The actor, who has been mar­ried three times, has three chil­dren, in­clud­ing 10-year-old twins with his wife Maanay­ata Dutt. His first wife Richa died in 1996.</p>
    <p>In 2018, a film about his life, Sanju, was re­leased cov­er­ing the pe­riod from just be­fore Dutt’s Bol­ly­wood de­but in the ro­man­tic drama Rocky in 1981 to his re­lease from jail in 2016.</p>
