    <p>The As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore (ABS), work­ing with Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion (SGX RegCo), has is­sued en­hanced guide­lines that will raise the stan­dards of due dili­gence con­ducted on com­pa­nies plan­ning to list here.</p>
    <p>The up­dated ABS List­ings Due Dili­gence Guide­lines were launched yes­ter­day and take im­me­di­ate ef­fect. The guide­lines were last re­vised in 2016.</p>
    <p>Is­sue man­agers and full spon­sors will have to meet the higher stan­dards re­sult­ing from the up­dated guide­lines when they con­duct due dili­gence work dur­ing an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer, re­verse takeover or list­ing process.</p>
    <p>ABS di­rec­tor Ong-Ang Ai Boon said reg­u­lar up­dates are nec­es­sary to en­sure that guide­lines con­tinue to be rel­e­vant to the con­stantly chang­ing eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>“With the in­crease in is­suers from more nascent sec­tors such as tech­nol­ogy that are seek­ing eq­uity cap­i­tal, it be­comes es­pe­cially im­por­tant for is­sue man­agers, full spon­sors and their pro­fes­sion­als to adapt due dili­gence prac­tices that ad­dress the par­tic­u­lar needs of the new mar­ket en­vi­ron­ment,” she said.</p>
    <p>Key changes in the re­vised guide­lines in­clude:</p>
    <p>• An in­creased fo­cus on the as­sess­ment of the ad­e­quacy and ef­fec­tive­ness of the is­suer’s in­ter­nal con­trols to meet its busi­ness needs and chal­lenges as a listed com­pany.</p>
    <p>• As­sess­ment of the sus­tain­abil­ity and vi­a­bil­ity of the is­suer’s busi­ness, tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion, in par­tic­u­lar, the chal­lenges posed by the pre­vail­ing eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>• Tar­geted guide­lines for due dili­gence on is­suers op­er­at­ing in spe­cialised, re­stricted or niche in­dus­tries, and/or in higher-risk ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, SGX RegCo said is­sue man­agers will have to com­ply with the ABS due dili­gence guide­lines, and that th­ese would be in­cor­po­rated into the main­board list­ing rules, fol­low­ing feed­back from a pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion in late 2018.</p>
    <p>SGX RegCo chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Boon Gin told The Busi­ness Times that changes to the due dili­gence guide­lines were prompted by cases seen, but de­clined to elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>“Is­sue man­agers and full spon­sors are our fel­low front-line gate­keep­ers to our mar­ket. That is their first and fore­most role and re­spon­si­bil­ity. They must there­fore em­pha­sise sub­stance over form and exhibit a healthy dose of pro­fes­sional scep­ti­cism when con­duct­ing list­ings due dili­gence.”</p>
