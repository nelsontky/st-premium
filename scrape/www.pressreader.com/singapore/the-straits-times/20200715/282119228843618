    <p>A babysit­ter, ac­cused of poi­son­ing two baby girls un­der her care in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents, de­nied in a district court yes­ter­day that she had fed any of her med­i­ca­tions to the chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah Jamari also told the court that she had been pre­scribed some of the drugs that were later found to be present in the two ba­bies.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old Sin­ga­porean is ac­cused of two counts of administer­ing poi­sons to the ba­bies with the in­ten­tion of hurt­ing them.</p>
    <p>One of the in­fants was just five months old at the time, while the other was 11 months old. They are not re­lated to each other.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing the stand on the sixth day of her trial, Sa’adiah said she had been pre­scribed di­azepam and al­pra­zo­lam, which are used to treat anx­i­ety dis­or­ders.</p>
    <p>It was not men­tioned in court why she was pre­scribed the drugs.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court heard that at the time of the al­leged of­fences, she also had chlor­pheni­ramine, an an­ti­his­tamine, in her Hougang flat.</p>
    <p>Traces of the three sub­stances had been de­tected in both ba­bies.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah had also been pre­scribed the sleep­ing drug zolpi­dem. This drug had been found in only the younger baby.</p>
    <p>The court heard that other sub­stances, in­clud­ing an­other sleep­ing drug, temazepam, had also been found in the two ba­bies.</p>
    <p>When ex­am­ined by de­fence lawyer Chua Eng Hui, Sa’adiah told District Judge John Ng that she did not recog­nise these other drugs, and de­nied giv­ing them to the girls.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah, who has two daugh­ters, tes­ti­fied that she took care of the younger baby and the baby’s then five-year-old sis­ter in her flat be­tween Novem­ber and De­cem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>She also told the court that there were oc­ca­sions when she bought items for the two sib­lings, in­clud­ing a swing for the older girl, but did not ask their mother to com­pen­sate her. “I love the chil­dren,” she told Judge Ng.</p>
    <p>The girls’ mother had ear­lier tes­ti­fied that her baby was found to be “very drowsy” and “cranky” af­ter leav­ing Sa’adiah’s flat.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old mother added that the baby was then hos­pi­talised for sev­eral days.</p>
    <p>The woman later alerted the po­lice af­ter re­ceiv­ing a hos­pi­tal re­port list­ing a range of drugs de­tected in her daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah told the court yes­ter­day that she took care of the older baby in De­cem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>The baby’s mother, 22, tes­ti­fied</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old Sin­ga­porean is ac­cused of two counts of administer­ing poi­sons to the ba­bies with the in­ten­tion of hurt­ing them. One of the in­fants was just five months old at the time, while the other was 11 months old. They are not re­lated to each other.</p>
    <p>in Fe­bru­ary that she needed some­body to look af­ter her child on Christ­mas evening, and took her daugh­ter to Sa’adiah’s flat.</p>
    <p>The mother added t hat her boyfriend picked up the baby at around 6am the next day, and she later no­ticed that her in­fant seemed “tired”.</p>
    <p>The baby was taken to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal, and was ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>A urine sam­ple taken from the baby was later found to con­tain sub­stances that in­cluded al­pra­zo­lam and di­azepam. She was dis­charged on Jan 1, 2017.</p>
    <p>Both mothers can­not be named, ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect their chil­dren’s iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah is out on bail of $10,000, and her trial will re­sume to­day.</p>
