    <p>Four in 10 con­firmed Covid-19 cases here con­tin­ued to en­gage in com­mu­nity ac­tiv­i­ties af­ter the on­set of symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Of these, about a third went to work, and many also vis­ited shop­ping cen­tres, su­per­mar­kets and hawker cen­tres, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Such be­hav­iour jeop­ar­dises ef­forts to fight Covid-19 here, said Mr Gan, who urged peo­ple to see a doc­tor if they are un­well and stay home dur­ing med­i­cal leave or un­til swab re­sults turn out neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>“To be fair to some of them, the symp­toms may be very mild. To them, they may feel that this may be just a cold, just a lit­tle bit of a scratchy throat or snif­fle, and they may think noth­ing about it and hope­fully it may blow over in a day or two,” said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>He also urged those who feel un­well not to self-med­i­cate but to see a doc­tor in­stead, and not go to work.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said: “I can un­der­stand many of them are very con­sci­en­tious. They feel bad not to turn up for work, so they would rather go back to work, just bear the dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>“But for the pur­pose of (fight­ing) Covid-19, please don’t go back to work... This is not only for your own ben­e­fit but also for the ben­e­fit of your em­ployer as well as your fel­low work­ers.”</p>
    <p>Health Min­istry di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said those who are un­well should be mind­ful that loved ones at home who are older and may have med­i­cal prob­lems are vul­ner­a­ble to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“If we have symp­toms and we are go­ing to see a doc­tor early, we are ac­tu­ally do­ing our bit to pro­tect them as well,” added As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said that no mat­ter how much is done in terms of screen­ing and sur­veil­lance, the role of the in­di­vid­ual is crit­i­cal in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, good per­sonal hy­giene and mask wear­ing con­tinue to be crit­i­cal in help­ing to keep trans­mis­sions low.</p>
    <p>He said: “We can­not and should not rely on en­force­ment to re­mind our­selves to be so­cially re­spon­si­ble. In this new Covid nor­mal that we need to move to, the role of the in­di­vid­ual is cru­cial.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Fight­ing the virus re­quires sig­nif­i­cant shifts in be­hav­iour and mind­set. Some of these changes may be in­con­ve­nient or even painful. But we can change our so­cial norms if we make a col­lec­tive ef­fort by each play­ing our part.”</p>
