    <p>I re­cently had to re­assess my long-held con­vic­tion that, at some fun­da­men­tal level, I need to travel.</p>
    <p>If travel were as es­sen­tial to my life as I once thought, I should have been at least a lit­tle ex­cited over news that a leisure travel bub­ble would be­gin on Nov 22 be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong, for which trav­ellers need not be quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>Even if Hong Kong were not my top pick, some part of me should have, like a dog with its head perked up hop­ing for scraps at the din­ing ta­ble, cheered at the prospect of be­ing able to travel again, after eight months of closed bor­ders.</p>
    <p>In­stead, I said “Eh”, clicked on an­other link and went to read about the MRT break­down.</p>
    <p>This could never have hap­pened in my late teens, when I would have quite hon­estly told any­one who asked that I was “dy­ing” to travel.</p>
    <p>I fer­vently be­lieved in all the usual ar­gu­ments for travel: to see all the world has to of­fer, to get away from the drudgery of bor­ing old Sin­ga­pore, to ex­pand my men­tal hori­zons and be a global cit­i­zen. A travel ban to my melo­dra­matic teenage mind would have been akin to im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>But al­most with­out me real­is­ing it, my val­ues and pri­or­i­ties had shifted and I wanted to find out why.</p>
    <p>In 2020, any­one look­ing for an ex­pla­na­tion for a big change in their lives would not have to look very far. From a mildly alarm­ing out­break in China that could be ob­served from afar, Covid-19 bal­looned into a global pandemic that brought air travel to a stand­still and ripped over­seas hol­i­day plans to shreds.</p>
    <p>The ef­fects of ad­just­ing to the post-Covid-19 re­al­ity on the way we think and be­have should not be un­der­stated.</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker shrinks the di­men­sions of your uni­verse to your home and what­ever is within 10 min­utes’ walk away, hop­ping three stops down the MRT line starts to look like a real ad­ven­ture.</p>
    <p>In the space of a few months, you be­gin to pine for the ra­men at Chi­jmes like you used to long for the ra­men in Fukuoka. (I’ve heard that some peo­ple started to feel the same for the of­fice as if it were Tokyo Dis­ney­land, but that’s tak­ing it too far for me.)</p>
    <p>Thoughts of for­eign de­lights fell away as many of the once com­mon­place el­e­ments of my life that I used to take for granted be­gan to feel new and pre­cious again when Sin­ga­pore en­tered phase two.</p>
    <p>These acutely lo­cal ac­tiv­i­ties and pur­suits were, to my sur­prise,</p>
    <p>meet­ing some of the emo­tional and soul-nour­ish­ing needs I had pre­vi­ously thought only travel could do.</p>
    <p>I was also re­minded of how the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple must have lived be­fore the In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion, when the en­tirety of their uni­verse would have been mea­sured by how far they could walk, or at best how far a horse could take them.</p>
    <p>A day’s jour­ney would have taken them not to the United States, but merely from one end of Sin­ga­pore to the other. That is, if they even thought that there was some­thing on the other end worth look­ing for or at.</p>
    <p>The key, I think, is that our ex­pec­ta­tions of what is nor­mal and need­ful are shaped by the times we are liv­ing in. These ex­pec­ta­tions are not im­mutable or even ra­tio­nal, even though we of­ten be­have as if they are.</p>
    <p>When ev­ery­one you know goes on hol­i­days, and agrees gen­er­ally on how and why hol­i­days are good for them, it’s easy to start think­ing of over­seas travel as a mat­ter of course, or even as an el­e­men­tal need.</p>
    <p>But, re­ally, over­seas leisure travel is a want dis­guised as a need, the de­ceit con­ve­niently main­tained by a web of in­ter­lock­ing fic­tions.</p>
    <p>Add a pinch of “other peo­ple are do­ing it and I don’t want to miss out”, a dash of “I want to go to...” and a tea­spoon­ful of “I want to see new things”, and sud­denly “I need a break” is trans­muted into “I need to spend thou­sands of dol­lars to fly thou­sands of kilo­me­tres away”.</p>
    <p>There is no longer any room for such com­fort­able il­lu­sions in the post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>A prospec­tive trav­eller to­day has to deal with a range of im­ped­i­ments that sig­nif­i­cantly dampen wan­der­lust, such as the threat of re­newed in­fec­tion waves, higher costs, and the in­con­ve­nience of test­ing and quar­an­tine re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>A study of 10,000 fre­quent fliers around the world re­leased by London-based firm In­marsat last Tues­day found that, ow­ing to such con­cerns, 83 per cent of re­spon­dents would be re­luc­tant to re­turn to their old travel habits even when the pandemic sub­sides.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I also re­alised that the per­son who burned with such de­sire to go over­seas more than 10 years ago no longer ex­ists.</p>
    <p>My younger self would have felt the loss of leisure travel most keenly, and I have no doubt many peo­ple feel the same now.</p>
    <p>But I have be­come less en­am­oured of what travel of­fers while still be­ing will­ing to par­take of its de­lights. One rea­son for this, of course, is that I have done a fair bit of trav­el­ling in the in­ter­ven­ing years since I was a teenager.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with those whose plans to go to the places at the top of their bucket lists have been foiled by the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion, I can be more at peace be­cause I can re­treat to the sanc­tu­ary of my mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond rea­son, I think, is that I am older and have re­spon­si­bil­i­ties be­yond joy-seek­ing to think about. The money I saved from not trav­el­ling dur­ing this pe­riod will come in handy when I have to pay for a wed­ding or a house, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>This is what “adult­ing” is all about, I tell my­self. It is about trad­ing the prom­ises of a gleam­ing fu­ture for the re­al­i­ties of a rugged present – no loss there.</p>
    <p>It is, of course, also pos­si­ble that I have em­barked on the process of be­com­ing a 70-year-old un­cle who never ven­tures far­ther than the cof­fee shop around the cor­ner be­cause the kopi is good and his joints hurt.</p>
    <p>But peo­ple have told me that it is not good to be­come such a home­body so early in life, even if my joints al­ready hurt.</p>
    <p>So al­low me to say in­stead that, in lieu of over­seas trips, I have been mak­ing plans that in­volve cross-is­land food trails and overnight road­side camp­ing.</p>
    <p>Travel re­stric­tions be damned: An ad­ven­ture awaits!</p>
