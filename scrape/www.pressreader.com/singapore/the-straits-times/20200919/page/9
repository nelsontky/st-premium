2 to 5 years was shortened to months.) 2 Pre-clinical testing Scientists test a new vaccine on cells and then give it to animals such as mice or monkeys to see if it produces an immune response. Number of vaccines at this stage* 3 Phase 1 (safety trials) Scientists give the vaccine to a small number of people – 20 to 100 – to test safety and dosage as well as to confirm that it stimulates the immune system. Combined phases One way to accelerate vaccine developmen­t is to combine phases. Some coronaviru­s vaccines are now in phase 1/2 trials, for example, in which they are tested for the first time on hundreds of people. Phase 2 (expanded trials) Scientists give the vaccine to hundreds of people split into groups, such as children and the elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differentl­y in them. These trials further test the vaccine’s safety and ability to stimulate the immune system. 5 7 Phase 3 (efficacy trials) Scientists give the vaccine to thousands of people and wait to see how many become infected, compared with those who received a placebo. These trials can determine if the vaccine protects against the coronaviru­s. In June, the US Food and Drug Administra­tion said a coronaviru­s vaccine would have to protect at least 50 per cent of vaccinated people to be considered effective. In addition, phase 3 trials are large enough to reveal evidence of relatively rare side effects that might be missed in earlier studies. Early or limited approval China and Russia have approved vaccines without waiting for the results of phase 3 trials. Experts say the rushed process has serious risks. Approval Regulators in each country review the trial results and decide whether to approve the vaccine or not. During a pandemic, a vaccine may receive emergency use authorisat­ion before getting formal approval. Once a vaccine is licensed, researcher­s continue to monitor people who receive it to make sure it is safe and effective. *As of Sept 17, 2020 1 4 6 8 Manufactur­ing Mass quantities of vaccine are produced and distribute­d.
