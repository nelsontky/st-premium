    <p>•</p>
    <p>In­done­sia looks to vac­ci­nate 160 mil­lion peo­ple against the coro­n­avirus by the end of next year, an am­bi­tious plan tar­get­ing more than half of the pop­u­la­tion of a na­tion com­prised of thou­sands of sep­a­rate is­lands.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment will fo­cus its ef­forts on vac­ci­nat­ing work­ing peo­ple in the world’s fourth-most pop­u­lous coun­try.</p>
    <p>The plan pri­ori­tises peo­ple aged 19 to 59, who make up 70 per cent of In­done­sia’s 268 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion, as well as those on the front lines of the pan­demic, such as health work­ers, the po­lice and mil­i­tary of­fi­cers, Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Af­fairs Air­langga Har­tarto said in a brief­ing on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s econ­omy is set to con­tract for the first time since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis more than two decades ago as it grap­ples with in­fec­tions that have re­cently climbed to about 4,000 a day.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia re­ported 4,007 more virus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing the coun­try’s to­tal to nearly 300,000. The death toll reached 11,055.</p>
    <p>The na­tion is run­ning fi­nal-stage clin­i­cal tri­als of a vac­cine de­vel­oped by China’s Si­no­vac Biotech, while Jakarta-based PT Kalbe Farma is work­ing with South Korea’s Genex­ine on an­other can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Kalbe Farma said yes­ter­day it has re­duced the price of remde­sivir by half, adding that the drug used for Covid-19 treat­ment is now avail­able at 1.5 mil­lion ru­piah (S$137.70) per unit.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion was taken after sug­ges­tions by the gov­ern­ment, med­i­cal work­ers and the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Dis­tribut­ing and ad­min­is­ter­ing the vac­cines after they are ap­proved will take con­sid­er­able ef­fort in the world’s largest ar­chi­pel­ago.</p>
    <p>It will in­volve more than 2,900 pub­lic and pri­vate hos­pi­tals, as well as more than 10,000 com­mu­nity health clin­ics, known as Puskesmas, Mr Air­langga said.</p>
    <p>While law man­dates each district must have at least one Puskesmas to of­fer ba­sic health­care, that is not al­ways the case in ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The prov­ince of West Pa­pua has only 0.73 clin­ics for each district, com­pared with 7.3 in Jakarta, ac­cord­ing to Health Min­istry data.</p>
    <p>Over­all, In­done­sia needs as many as 370 mil­lion vac­cine doses to achieve its tar­get, with the first stage of 36 mil­lion ex­pected to be dis­trib­uted in the fourth quar­ter of this year, Mr Air­langga said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is work­ing on a more de­tailed road map with a pres­i­den­tial de­cree set to be is­sued on the vac­ci­na­tion tech­nique, he added.</p>
