    <p>• Tot­ten­ham man­ager Jose Mour­inho has said he will ro­tate his squad amid a busy fes­tive sched­ule but cer­tain “unique play­ers” will fea­ture more than oth­ers as his team look to com­pete for the Premier League ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Spurs moved into the Europa League knock­out stage as group win­ners with a 2-0 vic­tory over Royal An­twerp on Thurs­day and are set to play seven times – six Premier League games and a League Cup quar­ter-fi­nal – in a lit­tle less than three weeks.</p>
    <p>“The Europa League is over now for a cou­ple of months, but now is an ac­cu­mu­la­tion of matches in the Premier League that, to be hon­est, are more dif­fi­cult than the Europa League matches,” Mour­inho told re­porters ahead of to­day’s league trip to Crys­tal Palace.</p>
    <p>“The qual­ity of teams is higher in the Premier League. We have also a quar­ter-fi­nal to play against Stoke City, and Stoke are do­ing so, so well in the (sec­ond-tier) Cham­pi­onship. With so many matches, do we need to make ro­ta­tions? Of course.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­pos­si­ble for a player to play all these matches within a short pe­riod of time. But at the same time there are unique play­ers... in spite of the squad be­ing very good, we have to give them more min­utes be­cause they can make a dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>He did not men­tion who those play­ers were but goal­keeper Hugo Lloris and mid­fielder Pierre-Emile Ho­jb­jerg have played ev­ery minute in the league so far, fol­lowed by for­wards Harry Kane and Son He­ung­min who have scored 18 goals be­tween them.</p>
    <p>Spurs led the stand­ings on 24 points from 11 games – above cham­pi­ons Liver­pool on goal dif­fer­ence</p>
    <p>– be­fore Chelsea’s match at Ever­ton yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho, the Premier League man­ager of the month for Novem­ber, said he was aware of the many threats posed by Roy Hodg­son’s Palace side even though he had not had time to work on his plans.</p>
    <p>“One of the things is the qual­ity of (Wil­fried) Zaha... The play­ers, the man­ager, the coach­ing staff is ba­si­cally the same as pre­vi­ous sea­sons,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They de­fend with lots of peo­ple and ex­pe­ri­ence but they have qual­ity in at­tack – or­gan­ised at­tack, counter-at­tack and set pieces. They are a team that can threaten in many dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham have taken seven points from matches against Manch­ester City, Chelsea and Arse­nal in re­cent weeks by de­fend­ing when nec­es­sary and hit­ting op­po­nents on the break.</p>
    <p>Many pun­dits have ques­tioned if the Spurs play­ers are happy play­ing a more com­bat­ive, de­fen­sive style de­spite the suc­cess it is bring­ing, but Hodg­son has de­fended</p>
    <p>Mour­inho’s style of play.</p>
    <p>He said: “I know ex­actly how it feels to be do­ing a good job and get­ting the team play­ing in the right way for the team, get­ting the re­sults, yet other peo­ple try­ing to tell you that there is an­other type of foot­ball they would pre­fer to see. I am full of sym­pa­thy or em­pa­thy with Jose on that point. He has been in foot­ball a long time and has been un­be­liev­ably suc­cess­ful wher­ever he has been. In most ar­gu­ments he is go­ing to win be­cause the peo­ple who are crit­i­cis­ing him will not have as many tro­phies as in their cab­i­nets as he has.”</p>
    <p>Palace have no fresh in­jury con­cerns, while Tot­ten­ham are hop­ing to have Tan­guy Ndombele, who played the fi­nal half an hour against An­twerp, and Serge Aurier fit for the match. Erik Lamela re­mains on the side­lines due to a foot prob­lem.</p>
