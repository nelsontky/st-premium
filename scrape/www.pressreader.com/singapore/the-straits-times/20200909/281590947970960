    <p>Char­i­ties, man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tions and reg­is­tered so­ci­eties are among the en­ti­ties that will be able to de­lay their an­nual gen­eral meet­ings (AGMs) un­til Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Char­i­ties, man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tions and reg­is­tered so­ci­eties are among the en­ti­ties that will be able to de­lay their an­nual gen­eral meet­ings un­til Dec 31.</p>
    <p>This will give them more time to ad­dress is­sues in hold­ing th­ese ses­sions, whether vir­tu­ally or phys­i­cally, the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, ex­ist­ing pro­vi­sions un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act al­low for such meet­ings to be de­ferred to a date no later than Sept 30.</p>
    <p>To give some en­ti­ties more time to over­come prac­ti­cal dif­fi­cul­ties in hold­ing vir­tual or phys­i­cal meet­ings amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, the de­fer­ral pro­vi­sions will now be ex­tended to a date no later than Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Th­ese en­ti­ties in­clude char­i­ties, co­op­er­a­tive so­ci­eties, man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tions, reg­is­tered so­ci­eties, mu­tual ben­e­fit or­gan­i­sa­tions, as well as trade unions and their ex­ec­u­tives and branches.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the de­fer­ral pro­vi­sion for the meet­ings of town coun­cils and their com­mit­tees, school man­age­ment com­mit­tees and gov­ern­ing boards, as well as those in­volv­ing bank­ruptcy and in­sol­vency will not be ex­tended.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, there will con­tinue to be no de­lays al­lowed for the gen­eral meet­ings of com­pa­nies, vari­able capital com­pa­nies, busi­ness trusts, unit trusts, deben­ture hold­ers, as well as the meet­ings of col­lec­tive sale com­mit­tees.</p>
    <p>“For the avoid­ance of doubt, en­ti­ties can choose to rely on meet­ing ar­range­ments per­mit­ted by their gov­ern­ing in­stru­ments, as long as they can do so in com­pli­ance with pre­vail­ing safe dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions,” the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Par­lia­ment passed the amend­ments to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, al­low­ing al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments for vir­tual meet­ings, such as an­nual gen­eral meet­ings, to con­tinue un­til June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>This ex­ten­sion will give en­ti­ties the op­tion to hold vir­tual meet­ings, even when they are per­mit­ted to hold phys­i­cal meet­ings un­der the pre­vail­ing Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, or­gan­i­sa­tions and en­ti­ties are al­lowed to do so un­til Sept 30. Be­fore the amend­ments, al­ter­na­tive meet­ing ar­range­ments un­der the Act were tied to the du­ra­tion of a Covid-19 con­trol or­der.</p>
    <p>“This will help keep phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tions and Covid-19 trans­mis­sion risks to a min­i­mum. The need to keep Covid-19 trans­mis­sion risks to a min­i­mum will re­main in the long term, even as safe dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions are grad­u­ally and cau­tiously re­laxed,” said MinLaw.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that the amend­ments will al­low en­ti­ties to con­duct vir­tual meet­ings, even if this is not al­lowed un­der the writ­ten law or le­gal in­stru­ment which pro­vides for it.</p>
    <p>This ex­ten­sion will give en­ti­ties the op­tion to hold vir­tual meet­ings, even when they are per­mit­ted to hold phys­i­cal meet­ings un­der the pre­vail­ing Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions.</p>
