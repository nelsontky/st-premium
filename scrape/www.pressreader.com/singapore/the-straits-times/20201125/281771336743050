    <p>FARMER BRETT HOSK­ING, ON THE IM­PACT OF CHINA’S HEFTY TAR­IFF ON AUS­TRALIA AMID WORS­EN­ING TIES</p>
    <p>Out­side the small Vic­to­rian town of Quam­bat­ook, on the grain-rich land of south-east Aus­tralia, Mr Brett Hosk­ing runs a bar­ley and wheat farm that has be­longed to his fam­ily for about 110 years.</p>
    <p>A fifth-gen­er­a­tion farmer, Mr Hosk­ing, 47, grew up on the 2,300ha farm and now runs it with his wife and four daugh­ters.</p>
    <p>The farm’s main crop is bar­ley, which is mostly ex­ported and ends up on din­ing ta­bles across Asia.</p>
    <p>But this re­li­able trade has run into a sud­den hur­dle in re­cent months, af­ter the main buyer of Aus­tralian bar­ley – China – im­posed a hefty 80.5 per cent tar­iff on the grain amid a wors­en­ing dis­pute be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>For Mr Hosk­ing, this led to a sud­den drop in the price of his main crop. His farm pro­duces about 1,500 tonnes of bar­ley each year. The price has fallen from A$250 (S$245) to A$200 a tonne, cost­ing him about A$75,000.</p>
    <p>“When the tar­iffs were in­tro­duced, we saw an im­me­di­ate drop in the price of bar­ley,” he told The Straits Times. “It means there is less rev­enue to in­vest back in our busi­ness or our lo­cal com­mu­nity – into the footy (foot­ball) club, the church.”</p>
    <p>Mr Hosk­ing said he was dis­ap­pointed about the tar­iffs and the on­go­ing dif­fi­cul­ties in the Aus­tralia-China re­la­tion­ship but was quickly ad­just­ing.</p>
    <p>For next year’s har­vest, he is con­sid­er­ing grow­ing less bar­ley and more wheat, which is mostly sold to In­done­sia and other parts of South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“You feel very help­less when some­thing like this hap­pens,” he said. “So, as a farmer, you fo­cus on what you can change.”</p>
    <p>China has also tar­geted Aus­tralian beef, wine, seafood, coal, tim­ber and cot­ton, caus­ing con­cerns amongst farm­ers, fish­er­men and busi­nesses across the coun­try and threat­en­ing an es­ti­mated A$20 bil­lion worth of ex­ports. China is Aus­tralia’s largest trad­ing part­ner, ac­count­ing for 39 per cent of Aus­tralian ex­ports last year.</p>
    <p>The stand-off re­cently led to A$2 mil­lion worth of live rock lob­sters be­ing left on the tar­mac at Shang­hai Pudong air­port af­ter the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties blocked their en­try. The de­lay forced the de­struc­tion of about A$100,000 worth of lob­sters.</p>
    <p>A shipload of Aus­tralian tim­ber was also re­cently de­layed, wine or­ders can­celled and de­layed, and a</p>
    <p>bar­ley ex­porter was sud­denly barred from ex­port­ing ship­ments.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cially, China has largely claimed its mea­sures are not ret­ri­bu­tion but are due to con­cerns about health or Aus­tralian trad­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>But its moves have widely been seen as reprisals fol­low­ing wors­en­ing bi­lat­eral re­la­tions in re­cent years, es­pe­cially since Can­berra in­tro­duced laws to com­bat for­eign in­ter­fer­ence – a move seen as aimed at Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Can­berra has also crit­i­cised Bei­jing’s con­duct in Hong Kong, Xin­jiang and the South China Sea, and was one of the first gov­ern­ments to ban Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions gi­ant Huawei from in­volve­ment in its 5G net­work roll­out.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Can­berra an­gered Bei­jing by call­ing for an in­quiry into the ori­gins of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In an un­usual move last week, the Chi­nese embassy in Can­berra gave a jour­nal­ist from Nine News a list of 14 griev­ances against Aus­tralia. The list at­tacks Aus­tralia for block­ing Chi­nese in­vest­ments, ac­cus­ing China of cy­ber at­tacks and fea­tur­ing “an­tag­o­nis­tic” cov­er­age of China in the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son hit back strongly, say­ing he wanted to im­prove ties with China but was not will­ing to com­pro­mise the na­tion’s val­ues or in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>“I’m not pre­pared to agree to a meet­ing on the con­di­tion that Aus­tralia com­pro­mise and trade away any of those things that were frankly listed in that un­of­fi­cial list of griev­ances,” he said last week.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son on Mon­day also in­sisted that Aus­tralia should not be seen as an ex­ten­sion of the United States and that Aus­tralia was not try­ing to con­tain China’s rise.</p>
    <p>“Our ac­tions are wrongly seen and in­ter­preted by some only through the lens of the strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion be­tween China and the US,” he said.</p>
    <p>China’s re­cent trade mea­sures have prompted calls in Aus­tralia to try to find new mar­kets.</p>
    <p>An ex­pert on the Aus­tralia-China eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship, Pro­fes­sor James Lau­rence­son, said di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion will work for some sec­tors like beef, where there is strong de­mand from coun­tries such as the US, Ja­pan and South Korea. Other sec­tors, such as the lob­ster in­dus­try which sells 90 per cent of its prod­uct to China for strong prices, are more vul­ner­a­ble, he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Lau­rence­son sug­gested that it may be sen­si­ble to set aside “re­silience funds” to in­sure against a down­turn.</p>
    <p>“Yes, China can seek to pun­ish Aus­tralian pro­duc­ers but Aus­tralian pro­duc­ers are not de­fence­less,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“I think you will see more and more Aus­tralian com­pa­nies set­ting up re­silience funds... mak­ing hay while the sun shines, but with a clear idea that the sun may not be shining for­ever.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pat O’Shan­nassy, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of grain ad­vo­cacy or­gan­i­sa­tion Grain Trade Aus­tralia, said the bar­ley tar­iffs had prompted grow­ers to look for new buy­ers in Saudi Ara­bia and South-east Asia. He said the stand-off with China had in­creased risk and un­cer­tainty for farm­ers, but “less than peo­ple might think”.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ers will ad­just,” he told The Straits Times. “They might grow more of other crops. Farm­ers are pretty re­silient.”</p>
    <p>He added: “They put up with droughts and floods and dis­eases – they are used to speed humps and will find a way to work their way through it.”</p>
