    <p>We have all been there – strug­gling to stay awake as the post-lunch food coma hits, wish­ing we could drape our­selves over the desk for a quick nap.</p>
    <p>Golden Vil­lage at Sun­tec City will do you one bet­ter. Last month, it launched a co-work­ing pack­age where pa­trons can work in its Gold Class lounge and nap in its Gold Class cin­ema.</p>
    <p>OF­FICE FOR THE DAY</p>
    <p>About a third of the lounge’s 40 seats were taken when The Sun­day Times vis­ited on a week­day after­noon. The crowd was younger and more ca­su­ally dressed than those in ho­tel lounges.</p>
    <p>The smell of pop­corn lin­gered in the air and movie trail­ers played in the back­ground.</p>
    <p>Not all seats have power plugs. Go for the ones at the far end of the lounge, where more ex­ten­sion cords are avail­able.</p>
    <p>Choose from two nap slots, be­tween noon and 1.30pm, or 2 and 3.30pm. You can en­ter the cin­ema any time dur­ing your slot, but try to set­tle in early to avoid dis­turb­ing oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The hall is silent and close to pitch black, save for reedy blue lights il­lu­mi­nat­ing seat numbers and con­trols. The ex­tremely plush seats re­cline al­most hor­i­zon­tally. Blan­kets are pro­vided – they feel a bit thin but smell laun­dry-fresh. Bring a sweater for ad­di­tional warmth, and a pair of earplugs in case you wind up next to a snor­ing neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>FEEL­ING PECKISH?</p>
    <p>A cup of cof­fee or tea and a box of pop­corn are in­cluded in the pack­age. Guests also get a dis­count on fin­ger food such as waf­fle fries ($6.50) and mains like Chicken Chop Kam­pong Fried Rice ($9.90).</p>
    <p>PERKS</p>
    <p>Book a co-work­ing pack­age from Mon­days to Thurs­days and re­ceive a movie dis­count voucher which al­lows you to buy two week­day movie tick­ets for $6 each. Co-work­ing on Fri­days gives you a sim­i­lar voucher for two week­end tick­ets at $9.50 each. The vouch­ers are valid for two weeks.</p>
