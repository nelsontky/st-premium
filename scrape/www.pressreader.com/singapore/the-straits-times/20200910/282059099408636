    <p>With the ex­cep­tion of mo­tor­cy­cles, cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) prices for other ve­hi­cles ended higher as a smaller quota and a longer bid­ding pe­riod am­pli­fied up­ward pres­sure.</p>
    <p>At the end of the lat­est ten­der at 4pm yes­ter­day, the COE premium for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp fin­ished at $37,766 – 5.8 per cent higher than three weeks ago. COE prices for cars above 1,600cc or 130bhp closed 7 per cent higher at $41,510.</p>
    <p>Prices of the Open COEs, which can be used for any ve­hi­cle type ex­cept mo­tor­cy­cles but which end up mostly for big­ger cars, also closed 7 per cent higher at $40,790.</p>
    <p>This rep­re­sents the third con­sec­u­tive round of in­creases, send­ing big car pre­mi­ums across the $40,000-mark for the first time since Novem­ber last year. The premium for smaller cars is now at its high­est since May 2018.</p>
    <p>De­spite wide­spread news of busi­nesses reel­ing from the coro­n­avirus out­break, com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE prices fin­ished 6.6 per cent higher at $26,644 – its high­est level since Au­gust last month.</p>
    <p>The COE price for mo­tor­cy­cles closed 0.4 per cent lower at $7,399.</p>
    <p>There was a three-week gap be­tween the pre­vi­ous ten­der and the lat­est one, in­stead of the usual two weeks. This gave mo­tor deal­ers more time to col­lect book­ings.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers point to ag­gres­sive pro­mo­tions by BMW agent Per­for­mance Mo­tors as an­other fac­tor for the premium rises. The firm is said to have col­lected more than 500 or­ders last month, with prices of its 1 and 2-se­ries mod­els close to Ja­panese prices.</p>
    <p>Di­ver­si­fied mo­tor group Prime chair­man Neo Nam Heng said: “Glob­ally, car sales have been down be­cause of the pan­demic. Deal­ers here are clear­ing stock, with the sup­port of their prin­ci­pals.”</p>
    <p>Other mo­tor traders said ag­gres­sive fi­nanc­ing schemes are also fu­elling the hike in COE prices – now at 25 per cent to 35 per cent higher than they were be­fore the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>In­flated in­voices, zero down pay­ment and sep­a­rate loans to over­come the 70 per cent cap on bor­row­ings are some of the schemes en­tic­ing buy­ers to pay higher prices.</p>
    <p>Deal­ers said higher prices trans­late to fat­ter mar­gins, which in turn fuel COE bids.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo ex­pects pres­sure to ease af­ter Novem­ber, when more cars are dereg­is­tered and un­used COEs re­turn to the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the Au­gust-Oc­to­ber quota is al­most 30 per cent smaller than the pre­vi­ous quota.</p>
