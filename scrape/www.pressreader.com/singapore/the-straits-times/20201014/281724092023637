    <p>Wire­card Sin­ga­pore is on track to re­turn all cus­tomers’ funds by to­day af­ter it was or­dered to cease its pay­ment ser­vices last month.</p>
    <p>It told the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) it had pro­cessed and paid out most of the pay­ments due to mer­chants for goods and ser­vices sold, MAS told The Straits Times yesterday.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tory body said it is closely mon­i­tor­ing that the re­main­ing cus­tomers’ funds are re­turned by the dead­line to­day.</p>
    <p>This would in­clude sums held as col­lat­eral.</p>
    <p>Wire­card pro­vided pro­cess­ing ser­vices for credit card pay­ments to close to 1,900 com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore, a num­ber of which saw the warn­ing signs and mi­grated to other providers be­fore MAS pulled the plug on the trou­bled com­pany’s pres­ence here.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that gen­er­ally, mer­chants would re­ceive the pay­ments from Wire­card one to two days af­ter a trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the na­ture of the busi­ness, Wire­card would hold a se­cu­rity col­lat­eral from mer­chants which it could draw on in the event of a re­fund to con­sumers or charge­back to the card is­suers.</p>
    <p>Wire­card also helped com­pa­nies is­sue pre-paid cards and process ewal­let pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Pre-paid cards is­sued by Wire­card that are in the process of be­ing re­funded in­clude the RHB FX Multi-Cur­rency Card and TenX Visa Card.</p>
    <p>Both can no longer be used. A Wire­card spokesman told ST that the firm is work­ing with RHB Bank to re­turn all re­main­ing bal­ances to card­hold­ers by to­day, di­rectly cred­ited to cus­tomers’ RHB sav­ings ac­counts or through a cashier’s or­der mailed to them.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added: “Wire­card con­tin­ues to work to com­ply with the MAS di­rec­tives, which are its core fo­cus, whilst we con­tinue to ser­vice our clients from the non­reg­u­lated busi­ness that we are still pro­vid­ing tech­ni­cal and pro­cess­ing ser­vices to.”</p>
    <p>Wire­card also is­sued Sing­tel’s Dash Visa Vir­tual card, as well as pro­cessed the pay­ments for Sing­tel Dash, a mo­bile wal­let.</p>
    <p>Their ser­vices were not dis­rupted as Sing­tel switched to another pay­ment provider.</p>
    <p>The cryp­tocur­rency pre-paid</p>
    <p>Wirex card also an­nounced its part­ner­ship with Rails­bank in Au­gust to re­place Wire­card as its Asia-Pa­cific card provider.</p>
    <p>MAS is­sued the direc­tive on Wire­card on Sept 30, af­ter the com­pany said it was un­able to con­tinue pro­vid­ing pay­ment pro­cess­ing ser­vices to a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of mer­chants here.</p>
    <p>The shut­down of its pay­ment ser­vices affected thou­sands of con­sumers, who were un­able to make on­line pay­ments or credit card pay­ments with mer­chants on Wire­card plat­forms.</p>
    <p>M1, which has more than two mil­lion cus­tomers in Sin­ga­pore, had its monthly re­cur­ring pay­ment op­tion dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers were ad­vised to pay their bills through the AXS op­tion in the My M1 app.</p>
    <p>Pay­ment ser­vices at Safra and Star­bucks were also dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>Wire­card’s pay­ment so­lu­tions be­came widely used here af­ter it ac­quired over 2,000 mer­chant clients of Citibank in 2017.</p>
    <p>But sus­pect ac­count­ing prac­tices by the Ger­man fin­tech firm were re­vealed when the Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported al­le­ga­tions of fraud at Wire­card’s Asia head­quar­ters in Sin­ga­pore in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment, which deals with white-col­lar crime, be­gan in­ves­ti­ga­tions into Wire­card’s op­er­a­tions here the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>The drama kicked into high gear this year when Wire­card, which was founded in 1999, filed for in­sol­vency on June 25 af­ter ad­mit­ting that €1.9 bil­lion (S$3.04 bil­lion) in cash was miss­ing from its ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive Markus Braun and sev­eral other top ex­ec­u­tives were ar­rested on fraud charges.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s chief oper­at­ing of­fi­cer Jan Marsalek has van­ished and is be­ing sought by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Mr Howard Lo, founder and coowner at Em­pire Eats Group, said he ended his con­tract with Wire­card in June, af­ter he heard about its trou­bles.</p>
    <p>All eight restau­rants un­der the group, in­clud­ing Stand­ing Sushi Bar and Tanuki Raw, were un­able to ac­cept credit card pay­ments for about a month un­til Mr Lo found a new ser­vice provider.</p>
    <p>“As much as it was a pain to not be able to ac­cept credit cards, it is a good sign that peo­ple are com­fort­able pay­ing via PayNow, PayLah and GrabPay,” said Mr Lo.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore Air­lines spokesman said the com­pany, which was on the Wire­card plat­form, started mi­grat­ing most of its pay­ment ser­vices in July, with the trans­fer com­pleted in mid-Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Asked how Wire­card’s ces­sa­tion of ser­vices would af­fect fu­ture re­funds of air­line tick­ets that were pre­vi­ously pro­cessed by it, the spokesman said: “We have made al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments with other ac­quir­ers to en­sure smooth pro­cess­ing of re­funds.”</p>
    <p>Other op­tions for mer­chants in­clude e-pay­ment ser­vices such as Nets, PayNow and SGQR.</p>
    <p>Wire­card con­tin­ues to work to com­ply with the MAS di­rec­tives, which are its core fo­cus, whilst we con­tinue to ser­vice our clients from the non-reg­u­lated busi­ness that we are still pro­vid­ing tech­ni­cal and pro­cess­ing ser­vices to.</p>
