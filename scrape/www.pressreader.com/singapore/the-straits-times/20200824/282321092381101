    <p>Com­pet­ing and win­ning against some of the world’s best youth ath­letes in front of a home crowd at the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) opened up a world of pos­si­bil­i­ties for some of Singapore’s promis­ing young guns.</p>
    <p>But for some, the eu­pho­ria of their YOG tri­umphs soon turned into dis­il­lu­sion­ment and dis­ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>Some, like taek­wondo ex­po­nent Daryl Tan, were hit by the Sin­ga­porean co­nun­drum of hav­ing to bal­ance stud­ies with sport, while Sha­fi­nas Ab­dul Rah­man (taek­wondo) and archer Ab­dul Dayyan Jaf­far lamented the lack of de­vel­op­ment in their re­spec­tive dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>Sha­fi­nas, who won the girls’ 55kg cat­e­gory bronze medal at the YOG when she was 17, quit the na­tional team a year later.</p>
    <p>She had ini­tially set her sights on com­pet­ing at the 2011 SEA Games in In­done­sia. But she told The Straits Times that de­spite train­ing al­most daily, she felt that there was no proper guid­ance and ques­tioned whether there was a fu­ture for her in the sport.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old, who is now an oc­cu­pa­tional ther­a­pist, said: “I felt the fu­ture in taek­wondo was bleak and there wasn’t much di­rec­tion, so I de­cided that it would be bet­ter for me to fo­cus on some­thing more cer­tain.</p>
    <p>“For any ath­lete, you’re (al­ways)</p>
    <p>JES­SICA FOX, 26 (AUS)</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning gold in the ob­sta­cle K1 ca­noe slalom in Singapore, she won the K1 slalom Olympic sil­ver in 2012 and bronze in the same event four years later. She is also a 10-time world cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“I was 16 and felt like I’d trav­elled quite a lot, but there were some coun­tries that I’d never even heard of, let alone been to,” she told the Olympic web­site.</p>
    <p>“It was also great to meet ath­letes from all these places as well and hear their sto­ries about their way of liv­ing.” think­ing at the back of your mind whether all the sac­ri­fices and hard work will amount to some­thing, es­pe­cially in Singapore.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low YOG bronze medal­list Ab­dul Dayyan had a sim­i­lar sen­ti­ment. While he has fond mem­o­ries of his time as an ath­lete, his rec­ol­lec­tions are also tainted with the strug­gles he faced.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an “un­be­liev­able” ex­pe­ri­ence at the YOG where he se­cured a bronze medal in the mixed team re­curve event with 16-year-old Turk­ish part­ner Elif Be­gun­han Un­sal, he had hoped that the medal would re­sult in more sup­port for the sport and its ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing how he had trained with a few dif­fer­ent coaches then, he said he had wished for funds to</p>
    <p>ALEXAN­DER MAS­SIALAS, 26 (USA)</p>
    <p>He was a sil­ver medal­list in the cadet foil and part of the Amer­i­cas sex­tet that won bronze in the mixed team event here. He matched that haul at the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
    <p>“Singapore was great be­cause it got me ac­cus­tomed to what the Olympic Games feels like and what the spirit of the event is... Be­ing in an Ath­letes’ Vil­lage for the first time, meet­ing peo­ple from dif­fer­ent coun­tries and sports was an amaz­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and it got me ready for where I am now,” he told the Olympic web­site. hire at least two na­tional coaches for the long term.</p>
    <p>Train­ing then was also mainly held at archery club ranges or school fields and he had hoped for a na­tional train­ing ground.</p>
    <p>But lit­tle changed af­ter the YOG and Ab­dul Dayyan, who found it dif­fi­cult to jug­gle his stud­ies and train­ing, de­cided to fo­cus on the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>PANDELELA RINONG, 27 (MAS)</p>
    <p>Two years af­ter cap­tur­ing spring­board and plat­form sil­vers here, she be­came the first Malaysian woman to win an Olympic medal with the plat­form bronze at the Lon­don Games. In Rio, she teamed up with Cheong Jun Hoong to win sil­ver in the 10m syn­chro­nised event.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old said: “I miss my sport a lot, but things just didn’t go well. To me, it was more of a dis­ap­point­ment be­cause I feel that my sport was and still (is) ne­glected. I was ex­pect­ing change and im­prove­ment.”</p>
    <p>The civil ser­vant also called for more sup­port for ath­letes, say­ing: “All I’m ask­ing for is for the coun­try</p>
    <p>KIM JANG-MI, 27 (KOR)</p>
    <p>Her 10m air pis­tol gold in Singapore was her first vic­tory at in­ter­na­tional level. Two years later, she claimed the 25m pis­tol ti­tle at the Lon­don Olympics.</p>
    <p>“The most mem­o­rable thing was the vol­un­teers. The Korean vol­un­teers were re­ally friendly and help­ful to our shoot­ers, but also the lo­cal vol­un­teers in Singapore were great – they re­ally got be­hind us and of­fered a lot of sup­port,” she told the Olympic web­site. “I be­lieve the main ob­jec­tive of the YOG is to unite ath­letes from across the world. And it cer­tainly did that.” to find, in­vest and build up all our tal­ented ath­letes to stand a chance of achiev­ing their dreams.”</p>
    <p>Tan had con­sid­ered be­com­ing a full-time taek­wondo ex­po­nent fol­low­ing his bronze in the YOG’s 55kg cat­e­gory, but even­tu­ally de­cided to take the “safer” route and fo­cus on his stud­ies.</p>
    <p>While the 27-year-old does not re­mem­ber the big­gest fight of his ca­reer, it re­mains “one of the proud­est mo­ments” of his life.</p>
    <p>He said: “No one re­ally ex­pected us to (cap­ture a) medal or do well. I’m very proud that all my hard work paid off.”</p>
    <p>Now a cor­po­rate l awyer, Tan, who is no longer in­volved in sport, said the lessons he learnt as a young ath­lete have helped him as an adult.</p>
    <p>“Re­gard­less of the out­come, be­ing an ath­lete in your youth does con­trib­ute a fair bit of grit and tenac­ity for any fu­ture ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>QIU BO, 27 (CHN)</p>
    <p>He swept the spring­board and plat­form golds in Singapore and con­tin­ued to find suc­cess from 10m.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese diver took the plat­form sil­ver at the 2012 Olympics and gold at the 2014 Asian Games.</p>
    <p>He has three in­di­vid­ual ti­tles and a syn­chro­nised gold – with Huo Liang – from the world cham­pi­onships.</p>
    <p>“It was my first big in­ter­na­tional multi-sport event. It was the first big vic­tory in my ca­reer. It’s un­for­get­table,” he told the Olympic web­site.”</p>
