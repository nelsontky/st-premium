    <p>There were 257 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 47,912.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded eight com­mu­nity cases, com­pris­ing two Sin­ga­pore­ans, one work pass holder and five work per­mit hold­ers, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>Three of the com­mu­nity cases are linked to pre­vi­ous cases or clus­ters, while five are un­linked.</p>
    <p>There were also five im­ported cases who had been placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Among them was a one-year-old Sin­ga­porean boy who had re­turned from Azer­bai­jan on July 4. He tested pos­i­tive last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the 244 re­main­ing cases.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, FilmGarde cinema in Bugis+ mall, an Ac­tiveSG Gym at Fern­vale Square, The Me­trop­o­lis and VivoCity were among the new lo­ca­tions vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Chong Pang City Wet Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre and</p>
    <p>Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty Hawker Cen­tre were also newly added to the list.</p>
    <p>MOH also said the clus­ters at 3 Loyang Way 6 and 216 Tagore Lane were closed, and the dor­mi­to­ries now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from 16 two weeks ago to 10 in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of eight to six over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 253 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 44,071 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 181 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 3,618 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 oth­ers who tested pos­i­tive died of other causes.</p>
