    <p>SEOUL • South Korea is re­view­ing As­traZeneca’s re­quest for ap­proval of its vac­cine, as it ex­pands a ban on pri­vate gath­er­ings of more than four peo­ple to the whole coun­try, with daily cases top­ping over 1,000 in four days.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s drug safety min­istry said it will aim to ap­prove the Bri­tish shot for emer­gency use in 40 days.</p>
    <p>The ap­proval would mark the first for the coun­try, which has been grap­pling with a pro­longed surge in in­fec­tions dur­ing the lat­est wave that has led to a sharp in­crease in deaths.</p>
    <p>South Korea signed a deal last month with As­traZeneca to se­cure 20 mil­lion doses of its vac­cine, with the first ship­ment ex­pected as early as this month.</p>
    <p>It also has deals with three other drug­mak­ers – Pfizer, John­son & John­son’s Janssen, Moderna – and the global Covax ini­tia­tive backed by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>South Korea has se­cured 106 mil­lion doses to al­low for cov­er­age of 56 mil­lion peo­ple, more than the 52 mil­lion res­i­dents of the coun­try, Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA) direc­tor Jeong Eun-kyeong told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties plan to start vac­ci­na­tions next month, with health work­ers and vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple first in line, but the govern­ment has been crit­i­cised for that sched­ule in the light of vac­ci­na­tions un­der way in the United States and Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>The As­traZeneca shot is al­ready ap­proved in Bri­tain, Ar­gentina, El Sal­vador and In­dia. It is cheaper and can be stored at fridge tem­per­a­ture, which makes it eas­ier to trans­port and use than some ri­val shots, such as the one from Pfizer.</p>
    <p>But the Ox­ford/As­traZeneca vac­cine has been plagued by un­cer­tainty about its most ef­fec­tive dosage ever since data pub­lished in Novem­ber showed a half dose fol­lowed by a full dose had a 90 per cent suc­cess rate, while two full shots were 62 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber, SK Bio­science, 98 per cent owned by SK Chem­i­cal, re­ceived reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to be­gin hu­man clin­i­cal tri­als of As­traZeneca’s ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine, hav­ing agreed in July to man­u­fac­ture the shots to help the Bri­tish com­pany build global sup­plies.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 1,020 new coro­n­avirus cases as of mid­night on Sun­day, bring­ing the to­tal to 64,264 in­fec­tions, with 981 deaths, ac­cord­ing to the KDCA.</p>
    <p>A ban on small pri­vate gath­er­ings that was in place in the greater Seoul area was ex­panded na­tion­wide un­til Jan 17. “The rea­son we have ex­panded the ban... across the coun­try is be­cause gath­er­ing of peo­ple it­self is far more dan­ger­ous than a spe­cific venue,” Mr Jeong said.</p>
    <p>The ex­tended so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules im­posed on Seoul and neigh­bour­ing ar­eas in­clude curbs on churches, res­tau­rants, cafes, ski re­sorts and other venues.</p>
    <p>More than 60 per cent of South Korea’s cases are from Seoul, Gyeonggi prov­ince and the city of In­cheon, with mass clus­ter out­breaks cen­tred on nurs­ing homes and pris­ons.</p>
