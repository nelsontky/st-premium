    <p>Buy­ers of com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial prop­erty who have been un­able to meet cer­tain con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions due to the pan­demic now have tem­po­rary re­lief from le­gal and en­force­ment ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act has been ex­panded to cover op­tion to pur­chase (OTP) and sales and pur­chase agree­ments be­tween de­vel­op­ers and buy­ers of com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial sites.</p>
    <p>The changes took ef­fect last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>This law al­ready cov­ers OTPs and sales and pur­chase agree­ments or agree­ments for lease with res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>The re­lief pe­riod, which ini­tially ran from April 20 to Oct 19 for home buy­ers and de­vel­op­ers, has been ex­tended to Dec 31. Like­wise, the re­lief pe­riod for com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial prop­erty buy­ers and de­vel­op­ers will ex­pire on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment said yes­ter­day that it con­sid­ered feed­back from buy­ers and de­vel­op­ers of com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial prop­er­ties and ex­tended the re­lief to “en­sure par­ity in treat­ment”.</p>
    <p>This is aimed at help­ing buy­ers af­fected by the pan­demic hold on to res­i­den­tial, com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial prop­erty that they have com­mit­ted to buy.</p>
    <p>Longer ex­ten­sions to the re­lief pe­riod have been given for cer­tain cat­e­gories of con­tracts, in­clud­ing OTPs and sales and pur­chase agree­ments with de­vel­op­ers as these con­tinue to face sig­nif­i­cant un­cer­tainty, the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) said.</p>
    <p>“The ex­ten­sion will as­sist pur­chasers... who re­quire more time to make their pay­ments, par­tic­u­larly those who pay de­vel­op­ers di­rectly with­out tak­ing a bank loan, with min­i­mal im­pact to de­vel­op­ers’ cash flow,” MinLaw said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tri­cia Song, head of re­search at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional, called the ex­ten­sion of the re­lief pe­riod “a mild pos­i­tive but ex­pected” af­ter de­vel­op­ers of res­i­den­tial, com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial projects were given an ad­di­tional six months to com­plete con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>“The ex­ten­sion may go some way to help home buy­ers who qual­ify for re­lief as their eco­nomic con­di­tions may still not have im­proved, given the pro­tracted Covid-19 con­di­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>“For res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ers, any fi­nan­cial gap re­sult­ing from the ex­ten­sion to home buy­ers should be mit­i­gated” by the ex­tra six months they have to com­plete build­ing, she added.</p>
    <p>Like other con­tracts cov­ered un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, they must have been en­tered into be­fore March 25, with con­trac­tual per­for­mance due on or af­ter Feb 1.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Act, the buyer may serve a no­ti­fi­ca­tion for re­lief on the de­vel­oper. This bars the de­vel­oper dur­ing the re­lief pe­riod from with­hold­ing or for­feit­ing any part of the book­ing fee paid un­der the OTP, or from ter­mi­nat­ing the agree­ment if the buyer is un­able to pay.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­oper can also serve a no­ti­fi­ca­tion for re­lief on buy­ers to seek tem­po­rary pro­tec­tion from be­ing sued dur­ing the re­lief pe­riod if it can­not per­form con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Par­ties in OTPs must serve the no­ti­fi­ca­tion for re­lief by Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Once a no­ti­fi­ca­tion for re­lief has been served, the de­vel­oper can­not uni­lat­er­ally in­crease in­ter­est rates or im­pose new charges on de­layed pay­ments be­yond what is pro­vided for in the sales and pur­chase agree­ment.</p>
    <p>And late pay­ment in­ter­est or charges un­der sales and pur­chase agree­ments will be capped at an amount equal to 5 per cent a year of sim­ple in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>If the par­ties can­not reach an agree­ment even af­ter a no­ti­fi­ca­tion for re­lief is served, they can ap­ply for an as­ses­sor’s de­ter­mi­na­tion. OTP ap­pli­ca­tions must be sub­mit­ted by Feb 28 next year, and for sales and pur­chase agree­ments, by Dec 31 this year.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion will as­sist pur­chasers... who re­quire more time to make their pay­ments, par­tic­u­larly those who pay de­vel­op­ers di­rectly with­out tak­ing a bank loan, with min­i­mal im­pact to de­vel­op­ers’ cash flow.</p>

    <p>The ex­ten­sion may go some way to help home buy­ers who qual­ify for re­lief as their eco­nomic con­di­tions may still not have im­proved, given the pro­tracted Covid-19 con­di­tions.</p>
