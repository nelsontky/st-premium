    <p>LONG WAIT FOR JUS­TICE</p>
    <p>Over four decades – that’s a long time to wait for jus­tice ’’</p>
    <p>DISTRICT AT­TOR­NEY DIANA BEC­TON in Con­tra Costa County, where some of Joseph James DeAn­gelo’s crimes oc­curred. NO MERCY</p>
    <p>But the sur­vivors have spo­ken clearly – the de­fen­dant de­serves no mercy. ’’</p>
    <p>JUDGE MICHAEL BOW­MAN, on DeAn­gelo.</p>
    <p>SACRAMENTO • A former Cal­i­for­nia po­lice of­fi­cer who lived a dou­ble life as the “Golden State Killer” was sen­tenced to life in prison on Fri­day for a string of mur­ders and rapes in the 1970s and 1980s that were solved through the use of pub­lic ge­neal­ogy web­sites.</p>
    <p>A Sacramento County j udge granted pros­e­cu­tors’ re­quest that Joseph James DeAn­gelo, 74, serve life in prison with­out the pos­si­bil­ity of pa­role fol­low­ing emo­tional state­ments from vic­tims or their fam­ily mem­bers in open court.</p>
    <p>A seem­ingly frail DeAn­gelo showed no emo­tion dur­ing the nearly two-hour sen­tenc­ing held in a makeshift court­room in­side a ball­room at Sacramento State Univer­sity so that vic­tims and fam­ily mem­bers could spread out amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>When given the chance to speak, he rose from a wheel­chair, took off his mask, looked around at sur­viv­ing vic­tims and rel­a­tives of those he mur­dered and said: “I’ve lis­tened to all your state­ments. Each one of them. And I’m really sorry to every­one I’ve hurt.”</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said they did not think his apol­ogy was sin­cere. They also showed video footage of him in his jail cell, climb­ing on a desk and stand­ing on one leg while clean­ing, which they said proved he did not need to use a wheel­chair.</p>
    <p>In June, he con­fessed to 13 mur­ders and 13 rape-re­lated charges for crimes car­ried out be­tween 1975 and 1986 as part of a plea deal with pros­e­cu­tors spar­ing him from a po­ten­tial death sen­tence.</p>
    <p>DeAn­gelo, whom a prose­cu­tor on Fri­day called a bo­gey­man who haunted Cal­i­for­nia for decades, also pub­licly ad­mit­ted to dozens more rapes for which the statute of lim­i­ta­tions had ex­pired.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said he in­vaded 120 homes across 11 coun­ties dur­ing his crime spree, ini­tially iden­ti­fied with a series of rapes and mur­ders around the state cap­i­tal of Sacramento.</p>
    <p>The iden­tity of the Golden State Killer re­mained a mys­tery, his crimes un­solved, for decades – un­til DeAn­gelo’s ar­rest in Sacramento County on April 24, 2018.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors tied him to the crimes us­ing a then-novel tech­nique of trac­ing him through fam­ily DNA from com­mer­cial ge­neal­ogy web­sites.</p>
    <p>Sacramento County District At­tor­ney Anne Marie Schu­bert pushed for decades to find a way to solve the cold case that shook the state and re­gion.</p>
    <p>DeAn­gelo’s crimes, she said, had trau­ma­tised gen­er­a­tions in the cap­i­tal re­gion. “For folks in Sacramento that lived through this, I hope you open the win­dows tonight and feel the breeze,” she said.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors from coun­ties where he car­ried out his crimes told Judge Michael Bow­man that he de­served no mercy.</p>
    <p>“Over four decades – that’s a long time to wait for jus­tice,” said Ms Diana Bec­ton, the Con­tra Costa County District At­tor­ney where some of the crimes oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Judge Bow­man said he had no power to de­ter­mine what type of prison DeAn­gelo is sent to.</p>
    <p>“But the sur­vivors have spo­ken clearly – the de­fen­dant de­serves no mercy,” he said, as those in the court­room burst into loud ap­plause.</p>
    <p>Ms Court­ney Strouse’s mother was raped by DeAn­gelo in the 1970s and un­til her death in 2016, she awoke re­peat­edly dur­ing the nights to check on her chil­dren and make sure all doors and win­dows were locked.</p>
    <p>Ms Strouse said she had learnt to live in con­stant fear, but that Fri­day’s sen­tenc­ing brought some re­lief.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice to have the bo­gey­man gone,” she said. “It’s like a fa­ble you’re told all your life about the bo­gey­man and now, he’s gone.”</p>
