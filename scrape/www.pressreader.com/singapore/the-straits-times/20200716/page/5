        A5 THE STRAITS TIMES THURSDAY, JULY 16, 2020 | | | voters for each constituen­cy.
The PAP’s national vote share fell by one-hundredth of a percentage point, from 61.24 per cent before accounting for overseas voters, to 61.23 per cent.
The Elections Department (ELD) said yesterday that 72.3 per cent of the 6,570 registered overseas voters turned up to vote.
The votes cast by the 4,794 Singaporea­ns at designated polling stations around the world were counted yesterday at the ELD Training Centre in Victoria Street, the ELD said.
A further 101 Singaporea­ns had applied to vote overseas but were unable to do so, owing to a glitch in the Immigratio­n and Checkpoint­s Authority’s system.
The overseas voters cast their ballots in 10 cities around the world with significan­t numbers of Singaporea­ns: Beijing, Canberra, Dubai, Hong Kong, London, New York, San Francisco, Shanghai, Tokyo and Washington.
These were the same 10 cities where Singaporea­ns overseas could vote in the 2015 General Election.
Including the overseas voters, the total number of votes cast in the July 10 election was 2,540,359, including 45,822 rejected votes.
This is 95.81 per cent of the 2,651,435 registered electors, the ELD said. The voter turnout, which was the highest it has been in more than two decades, increased slightly from the 95.63 per cent at the close of the polls in Singapore.
Ahead of the ELD’s official announceme­nt, WP candidate for East Coast GRC Terence Tan had shared the breakdown of the overseas votes for his constituen­cy on Facebook, noting that there were no spoilt votes.
His wife, fellow WP member and new MP for Sengkang GRC He Ting Ru, said in a Facebook post last night that she was “deeply touched” by the love for Singapore shown by overseas voters. rei@sph.com.sg SEE HOME B1&2 PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
