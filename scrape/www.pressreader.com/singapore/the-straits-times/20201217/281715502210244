    <p>As the bells of a big Catholic church just south of Manila be­gan to toll at around 4am yes­ter­day, thou­sands were al­ready at the gates of the Na­tional Shrine of Our Mother of Per­pet­ual Help.</p>
    <p>More than 2,000 wor­ship­pers even­tu­ally made it in­side the church’s cav­ernous hall and onto its sprawl­ing grounds for the 4.30am mass.</p>
    <p>Many more stood out­side, be­hind its wrought-iron gates.</p>
    <p>In nor­mal times, the church can ac­com­mo­date up to 10,000 devo­tees. But these are ex­tra­or­di­nary times.</p>
    <p>Across the Philip­pines, a pre­dom­i­nantly Catholic ar­chi­pel­ago, churches have be­gun hold­ing predawn masses – known as the “misa de gallo” or “mass of the rooster” – in the run-up to Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>The masses will be held for nine straight days from yes­ter­day, cul­mi­nat­ing in mid­night mass on Christ­mas Eve.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited the Na­tional Shrine in Baclaran district, Paranaque city (also known as the Baclaran church), there was an abun­dance of cau­tion fol­low­ing an uptick in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>About 100 po­lice­men and dozens of mar­shals moved among the crowd, mak­ing sure ev­ery­one had masks and face shields on, were at least a me­tre apart, and not touch­ing or kiss­ing the holy relics in­side the church.</p>
    <p>Those lucky enough to get a pew seat were spaced an arm’s length from each other. Those out­side stood on blue and green mark­ings painted on the ground, in long lines akin to mil­i­tary for­ma­tions.</p>
    <p>As with other churches across the Philip­pines, the mass at the Baclaran church was also livestream­ed for those who pre­fer to par­tic­i­pate from their homes.</p>
    <p>Al­though cases of Covid-19 here have re­treated to be­low 1,500 a day, and the death rate has fallen to less than 2 per cent in re­cent weeks, ex­perts said ear­lier this week that they were al­ready see­ing signs of an uptick in in­fec­tions ahead of the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“There are in­di­ca­tors... that seem to show an uptick might al­ready be start­ing,” said Dr Guido David, head of the Octa Re­search Group run by state-owned Univer­sity of the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>He added that the coun­try could end the year with close to 500,000 cases.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Fran­cisco Duque yes­ter­day told re­porters the R-naught fig­ure in 12 cities in Metro Manila has inched past 1, sug­gest­ing a faster rate of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has al­ready told hos­pi­tals to set aside more beds for a pos­si­ble surge in cases next month.</p>
    <p>De­spite the warn­ings and curbs, turnout for the year’s first dawn mass was sur­pris­ingly strong.</p>
    <p>“We were ex­pect­ing less (of a crowd), but peo­ple came. Be­cause of the pan­demic, we thought... peo­ple would be dis­cour­aged,” said Fa­ther Ino Cueto, 55, one of the priests who over­see the Baclaran church.</p>
    <p>He said the pan­demic had prob­a­bly added an ur­gency among the peo­ple to turn to God.</p>
    <p>“We still don’t know when this (pan­demic) will all end. So for now, all we have is our faith,” he said.</p>
    <p>Fa­ther Cueto said the dawn masses are also an op­por­tu­nity for the Catholic church to pay tribute to front-line health work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Our front lin­ers are risk­ing their lives for us. That is their Christ­mas gift to us, and we want to cel­e­brate that. Many of our front lin­ers have al­ready lost their lives,” said Fa­ther Cueto.</p>
    <p>At­tend­ing dawn masses for nine straight days till Christ­mas Eve is a revered tra­di­tion here that dates back to when the Philip­pines was a colony of Spain in the 17th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Devo­tees try to at­tend ev­ery sin­gle mass with the hope that a spe­cial, per­sonal re­quest will be granted by Christ­mas Day.</p>
    <p>For Ms Erica Pal­mos, that wish is sim­ply to see her­self, her fam­ily and friends stay safe and well.</p>
    <p>“I just pray we all live through this pan­demic, and ev­ery­thing goes back to nor­mal soon,” the 18-year-old said.</p>
