    <p>Re­branded from bud­get chain Fra­grance Ho­tel last year, Ibis Bud­get Sin­ga­pore Im­pe­rial in Laven­der has had a much-needed facelift.</p>
    <p>Gone are the lurid pur­ple walls, cush­ions and bed run­ners, re­placed by sim­ple yet mod­ern rooms and brightly coloured mu­rals in the lobby, and neu­tral cream and beige tones in the rooms. A rooftop pool is tem­po­rar­ily closed.</p>
    <p>So it’s cheap, but is it com­fort­able?</p>
    <p>Crisp sheets and plush pil­lows en­sure a rest­ful sleep. There is not much of a view – my room over­looks a back al­ley – but there is close to zero traf­fic noise dur­ing my stay. Keep cur­tains closed for pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>I do not meet other guests – who in­clude those on stay-home no­tice, for­eign work­ers and those af­fected by Malaysia’s move­ment con­trol or­der – but I hear them through­out the day.</p>
    <p>In­dian mu­sic wafts from next door and Chi­nese ac­cents boom through the walls. A team of clean­ing staff, whom I spot each time I leave the room, makes its rounds con­sci­en­tiously.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>De­sign your own jew­ellery dish, clock or cof­fee ta­ble at Room to Imag­ine, a stu­dio spe­cial­is­ing in acrylic and resin pour art work­shops.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated in a shop­house in Jalan Be­sar about a 10-minute walk away, it of­fers work­shops that are beginner-friendly with re­ward­ing re­sults.</p>
    <p>I am no Pi­casso, but man­age to turn out an at­trac­tive pearles­cent sil­ver-and-co­ral cof­fee ta­ble when I did a class ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Plant lovers should stop by Jun­ga­lore along Tyr­whitt Road, with a cu­rated se­lec­tion of pop­u­lar house­plants. Staff dole out help­ful ad­vice for new­bie plant own­ers and you can also pick up an adorable planter to house your lit­tle green friend.</p>
    <p>You’ve saved on a stay, now in­dulge in a good meal.</p>
    <p>For break­fast, stop by new cafe Out To Chill, which opened just out­side the ho­tel last month and serves mains such as burg­ers and break­fast sets. It has part­nered the As­so­ci­a­tion for Per­sons with Spe­cial Needs Delta Se­nior School to give stu­dents with mild in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­i­ties an op­por­tu­nity to gain work ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>As a fan of street­side bar­be­cue joints in China, I am de­lighted to find that China Tastes in Tyr­whitt Road tops lamb, beef and pork skew­ers with the same de­li­cious spice-and-gar­lic blend. A pair of skew­ers starts at $2.</p>
    <p>Round off the meal with a plat­ter of la zi ji ($15.80) or deep-fried chicken with Sichuan chilli pep­pers, ad­dic­tively crisp with just enough heat.</p>
    <p>The fast-gen­tri­fy­ing Jalan Be­sar neigh­bour­hood is ripe for cafe hop­ping, with stops like iconic cof­fee joint Chye Seng Huat and vin­tage</p>
    <p>chic Wim­bly Lu, known for light and crispy waf­fles.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Hid­den gem or bud­get disas­ter?</p>
    <p>The Ibis brand, part of ho­tel group Ac­cor, as­sures clean­li­ness and a cer­tain stan­dard – though some may be leery about stay­ing in close quar­ters with guests who have just re­turned from abroad.</p>
    <p>Book­mark the ho­tel for a few months down the road, when crowds may have eased.</p>
