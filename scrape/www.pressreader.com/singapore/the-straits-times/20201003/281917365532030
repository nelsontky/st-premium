    <p>LONDON • China’s Huawei Tech­nolo­gies has failed to con­vince Bri­tish se­cu­rity of­fi­cials that the se­cu­rity risks of us­ing its prod­ucts in Bri­tain’s na­tional in­fras­truc­ture can be ad­e­quately man­aged, ac­cord­ing to a gov­ern­ment re­port.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment-led board that oversees the vet­ting of Huawei gear in Bri­tain said on Thurs­day that con­tin­ued prob­lems with the firm’s en­gi­neer­ing and se­cu­rity prac­tices meant it could give only “lim­ited as­sur­ance” that all risks to Bri­tish net­works could be suf­fi­ciently mit­i­gated in the long term.</p>
    <p>The board – which in­cludes of­fi­cials from Bri­tain’s in­tel­li­gence agency Gov­ern­ment Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Head­quar­ters – said Huawei had made only lim­ited progress ad­dress­ing is­sues raised last year.</p>
    <p>The find­ings will in­crease pres­sure on Huawei – the world’s big­gest maker of tele­coms net­work­ing equip­ment – which has been be­sieged by re­peated rounds of United States sanc­tions and al­le­ga­tions that its prod­ucts can be used by Bei­jing for spy­ing.</p>
    <p>Huawei said on Thurs­day that the Bri­tish as­sess­ment showed equip­ment vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties were not a re­sult of “Chi­nese state in­ter­fer­ence”.</p>
    <p>“The re­port ac­knowl­edges that while our soft­ware trans­for­ma­tion process is in its in­fancy, we have made some progress in im­prov­ing our soft­ware en­gi­neer­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” a Huawei spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ini­tially grant­ing Huawei a lim­ited role in the coun­try’s 5G in­fras­truc­ture, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son re­versed that de­ci­sion in July, or­der­ing all of the com­pany’s equip­ment to be purged from na­tional net­works by the end of 2027.</p>
    <p>The rea­son given for the about­turn was the im­pact of new US re­stric­tions on chip tech­nol­ogy, which Bri­tain’s Na­tional Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Cen­tre (NCSC) told min­is­ters meant Huawei was no longer a re­li­able equip­ment sup­plier.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said the lat­est re­port, which is pro­duced an­nu­ally as part of the gov­ern­ment’s pro­ce­dure for vet­ting Huawei equip­ment used in Bri­tain, looked at events last year and did not re­late to the sub­se­quent im­pact of the sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>In­creased vet­ting meant the num­ber of vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties iden­ti­fied in Huawei equip­ment last year rose sig­nif­i­cantly com­pared with the pre­vi­ous year, the re­port said, in­clud­ing one is­sue with the com­pany’s broad­band prod­ucts that was deemed to be of “na­tional sig­nif­i­cance”.</p>
    <p>The board said it was not aware of any of the vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties be­ing ex­ploited by na­tion-state hack­ers.</p>
    <p>“If an at­tacker has knowl­edge of these vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties and suf­fi­cient ac­cess to ex­ploit them, they may be able to af­fect the op­er­a­tion of a UK net­work, in some cases caus­ing it to cease op­er­at­ing cor­rectly,” the re­port noted.</p>
    <p>“NCSC does not be­lieve that the de­fects iden­ti­fied are a re­sult of Chi­nese state in­ter­fer­ence,” it added.</p>
