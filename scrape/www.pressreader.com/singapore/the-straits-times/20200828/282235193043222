    <p>BEI­JING • When the gov­ern­ment of the south­ern Chi­nese city of Zhong­shan heard that watch­maker Kam Yuen Group was fur­lough­ing more than 100 work­ers, it bro­kered a deal to shift the sur­plus staff to an­other man­u­fac­turer – a grow­ing prac­tice.</p>
    <p>The ar­range­ment will see Guang­dong Wel­land Tech­nol­ogy, which makes smart­watches and weigh­ing scales, take on 140 Kam Yuen work­ers over the next six months.</p>
    <p>Labour-shar­ing in China’s ex­port man­u­fac­tur­ing heart­land, prompted by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that by some es­ti­mates cost up to 80 mil­lion Chi­nese jobs at its peak, forms part of a wider ef­fort by Bei­jing to en­cour­age more flex­i­ble work – in­clud­ing self-em­ploy­ment and part-time roles – to sup­port jobs and main­tain so­cial sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“It is bet­ter to go to work than be­ing put on leave, even as the hourly wages they re­ceive could be some­what lower than what they got paid be­fore,” said Mr Wang Yaokun, hu­man re­sources direc­tor at Hong Kong­based Kam Yuen, which had al­ready lost 800 to 1,000 jobs in Zhong­shan.</p>
    <p>China’s to­tal work­force has shrunk slightly since 2017 to around 775 mil­lion last year, with the ex­port sec­tor em­ploy­ing about 180 mil­lion work­ers.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese man­u­fac­tur­ers have strug­gled in re­cent years to at­tract em­ploy­ees as the work­force ages and younger peo­ple es­chew fac­tory jobs.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has rav­aged the econ­omy and ex­ac­er­bated im­bal­ances, boost­ing mak­ers of med­i­cal equip­ment, as well as com­put­ers and mo­bile phones for the many mil­lions stuck at home, even as tra­di­tional labour-in­ten­sive sec­tors, such as tex­tiles, toys and fur­ni­ture, see weak demand.</p>
    <p>Un­der the agree­ment be­tween Kam Yuen and Wel­land, em­ploy­ees sec­onded to Wel­land are still em­ployed by Kam Yuen and will re­turn to the com­pany af­ter a six-month stint, when Kam Yuen hopes busi­ness is bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“We do not expect the busi­ness to com­pletely re­cover un­til the end of year,” Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal gov­ern­ments across the ex­port-fo­cused prov­inces of Guang­dong, Jiangsu and Zhe­jiang have been fa­cil­i­tat­ing sim­i­lar ar­range­ments i n re­cent months, with the cen­tral gov­ern­ment en­dors­ing the ap­proach in na­tion­wide guide­lines is­sued last month.</p>
    <p>In Dong­guan, a ma­jor man­u­fac­tur­ing hub, about 20,000 work­ers from 750 man­u­fac­tur­ers have signed up for such schemes since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Some in­dus­try and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials say the schemes could out­last the pan­demic shock. Mr Boyang Xue, north Asia an­a­lyst at con­sul­tancy Duck­erFron­tier, said that on­go­ing risks of economic “de­cou­pling” be­tween the United States and China, a shrink­ing labour force and ris­ing costs would drive more flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>BET­TER THAN NOT WORK­ING</p>
    <p>It is bet­ter to go to work than be­ing put on leave, even as the hourly wages they re­ceive could be some­what lower than what they got paid be­fore.</p>
