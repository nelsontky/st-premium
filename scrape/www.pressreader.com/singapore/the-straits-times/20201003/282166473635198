    <p>The doc­tor who sued a woman for li­bel af­ter she made al­le­ga­tions that he and an­other doc­tor had taken ad­van­tage of vul­ner­a­ble fe­male pa­tients to have sex with them has won his case.</p>
    <p>The High Court yes­ter­day over­turned a District Court’s dis­missal of the li­bel suit by pri­vate col­orec­tal sur­geon Ju­lian Ong against Ms Serene Tiong, who had an ex­tra­mar­i­tal af­fair with Dr Chan Herng Nieng, then a psy­chi­a­trist at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH).</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions were di­rected at the two doc­tors.</p>
    <p>In his de­ci­sion, Justice See Kee Oon said that although Dr Ong has won the case, both he and Dr Chan “do not have any rea­son to hold their heads high”.</p>
    <p>He said their “smug boasts of their trysts with var­i­ous women, as well as the de­mean­ing terms in which they gloat­ingly describe their sex­ual con­quests, speak to their true char­ac­ter”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tiong had made the al­le­ga­tions in June 2018, in a com­plaint she lodged with the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC).</p>
    <p>She also e-mailed the com­plaint to other doc­tors at SGH and in pri­vate prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Ms Tiong did this af­ter dis­cov­er­ing What­sApp mes­sages be­tween Dr Chan and Dr Ong.</p>
    <p>She had ac­cused the doc­tors of tak­ing ad­van­tage of, and us­ing their po­si­tions to “source” and “groom” vul­ner­a­ble fe­male pa­tients and col­leagues for sex.</p>
    <p>Justice See said the main al­le­ga­tion is that of col­lud­ing and tak­ing ad­van­tage of vul­ner­a­ble fe­male pa­tients.</p>
    <p>He did not ac­cept the district judge’s find­ings that Ms Tiong was one of Dr Chan’s vul­ner­a­ble fe­male pa­tients, not­ing that she al­ready had an in­ti­mate re­la­tion­ship with him be­fore he pro­vided her with Xanax for her anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>Dr Ong had said that he was not aware that Dr Chan had pre­scribed medicine to Ms Tiong.</p>
    <p>Justice See said the al­le­ga­tion of “col­lu­sion” be­tween the two doc­tors to take ad­van­tage of Ms Tiong as a fe­male pa­tient was there­fore not made out.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he up­held the district judge’s find­ing that what Dr Ong did in giv­ing the tele­phone num­ber of one of his pa­tients, re­ferred to as K, to Dr Chan for him to “try his luck at get­ting her to have sex” was tan­ta­mount to col­lud­ing to take ad­van­tage of K.</p>
    <p>But he said K was one pa­tient, and does not con­sti­tute vul­ner­a­ble pa­tients in plu­ral, some­thing Ms Tiong had al­leged in her com­plaint.</p>
    <p>“There must be ev­i­dence of more than one pa­tient who had been tar­geted, as K’s case may have been purely a one-off in­stance of a pa­tient who be­came a pos­si­ble sex tar­get,” he added.</p>
    <p>Justice See said the district judge’s views may have been tainted with re­gard to Ms Tiong’s ac­cu­sa­tion that the doc­tors had taken ad­van­tage of four women col­leagues.</p>
    <p>Two could not be proven as col­leagues, and the other two were not a “po­ten­tial tar­get of col­lu­sion”.</p>
    <p>Justice See said the only pat­tern re­vealed is that the two doc­tors were “con­sum­mate op­por­tunists, con­stantly look­ing out for women with sex in mind”.</p>
    <p>But the ex­am­ples did not show any col­lu­sion be­tween them to take ad­van­tage of vul­ner­a­ble women or col­leagues, he added.</p>
    <p>He also found that Ms Tiong shot out her mis­sives to the SMC and oth­ers in her own “im­pres­sion­is­tic view”, and that her view was some­what jaun­diced and not wholly sus­tain­able</p>
    <p>While J us­tice See found i n favour of Dr Ong, he said Dr Chan’s ad­mis­sion to touch­ing his col­league in­ap­pro­pri­ately in the past “may be a mat­ter for the SMC to con­sider look­ing into fur­ther”.</p>
    <p>He added that this case may prove a Pyrrhic vic­tory for Dr Ong.</p>
    <p>“They may be per­fectly com­pe­tent doc­tors and their sex lives are, of course, pri­vate mat­ters. But their bla­tant treat­ment of women as sex ob­jects sul­lies what­ever pro­fes­sional rep­u­ta­tion they might have built up for them­selves,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dam­ages to be paid by Ms Tiong will be as­sessed by the District Court. There is also an in­junc­tion against her pub­lish­ing defam­a­tory words against Dr Ong.</p>
