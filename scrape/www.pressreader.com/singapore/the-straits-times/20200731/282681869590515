    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The Emmy Awards show in Septem­ber is the lat­est ca­su­alty of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood trade pub­li­ca­tion Va­ri­ety on Wednes­day said that host Jimmy Kim­mel and pro­duc­ers of the Sept 20 tele­cast have writ­ten to Emmy nom­i­nees con­firm­ing there will not be a tra­di­tional gath­er­ing in Los An­ge­les to cel­e­brate tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“As you’ve prob­a­bly guessed, we’re not go­ing to be ask­ing you to come to the Mi­crosoft The­atre in down­town LA on Septem­ber 20th. This year, it’s still go­ing to be TV in­dus­try’s big­gest night out... but we’ll come to you,” said the let­ter, ob­tained by Va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>It added that pro­duc­ers were plan­ning to film nom­i­nees at home or an­other lo­ca­tion of their choice.</p>
    <p>“So, what are you wear­ing? Our in­for­mal theme for the night is ‘come as you are, but make an ef­fort’. If you want to be in for­mal wear, we’d love that, but equally if you’re in the UK and it’s 3am, per­haps you want to be in de­signer py­ja­mas and record from your bed,” the let­ter added.</p>
    <p>The let­ter gave no de­tails about the for­mat of the show which is usu­ally broad­cast live in front of an au­di­ence of A-list stars. ABC tele­vi­sion, which will broad­cast the show, said on Wednes­day that plans were still be­ing worked out.</p>
    <p>The Emmy Awards is one of the few en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try gath­er­ings that have not been can­celled be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Venice film fes­ti­val or­gan­is­ers said this week that they were go­ing ahead in early Septem­ber with a slimmed down ver­sion of what will be the first ma­jor in-per­son movie fes­ti­val in the Covid-19 era.</p>
