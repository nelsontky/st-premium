    <p>At a re­cent re­fu­elling stop, the at­ten­dant cleaned the wind­screen and of­fered to check the en­gine-oil level of my seven-year-old Honda. Ap­par­ently, the oil level was low and he rec­om­mended the oil and quan­tity to re­plen­ish. Af­ter I bought the oil, he helped me top it up. It has been four days now and</p>
    <p>I have no­ticed that my car is emit­ting a lot of ex­haust smoke and there is a strong burn­ing smell. What has hap­pened and what should I do?</p>
    <p>First, check­ing the dip­stick to de­ter­mine oil level must be done only when the en­gine has been switched off for half an hour or longer.</p>
    <p>When the en­gine is run­ning, most of the oil in the sump is pumped through the var­i­ous lu­bri­ca­tion chan­nels. The sump, which is at the bot­tom of the en­gine, acts as a reser­voir to col­lect the oil for the pump to con­tinue cir­cu­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>Once the en­gine is shut down, the oil will drain into the sump. Un­like wa­ter, hot oil takes time to flow down and set­tle into the sump. This could take 30 min­utes or longer. Only then will the dip­stick in­di­cate the ac­tual oil level in the en­gine.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple’s vis­its to petrol sta­tions are typ­i­cally brief. There is def­i­nitely not enough time for all the oil to re­turn to the sump. Hence, the dip­stick may give a false low read­ing.</p>
    <p>Over-fill­ing of oil will lead to prob­lems. Ex­cess oil might en­ter the cylin­ders, re­sult­ing in a smoky ex­haust, as well as a burn­ing smell as oil is com­busted.</p>
    <p>If the vent valve gets over­whelmed, oil fumes may build up in the crank­case, which would strip vi­tal sur­faces of lu­bri­cant.</p>
    <p>You should get to a work­shop as soon as pos­si­ble and ask a me­chanic to drain the ex­cess oil.</p>
