    <p>Who would have thought that real-life ex­pe­ri­ences would make for an old-school ar­cade-style video game?</p>
    <p>The game in ques­tion – No No Square, de­signed by Start Some­thing Stu­dios – is one of the un­ex­pected works that are part of the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore’s (NMS) #NEVERBEFOR­ESG ex­hi­bi­tion, which launched on­line on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal show, which brings to­gether 140 works by 91 cre­atives, is NMS’ con­tri­bu­tion to the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum’s Pro­pos­als For Novel Ways Of Be­ing ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive brings to­gether 12 art in­sti­tu­tions and in­de­pen­dent art spa­ces and col­lec­tives to cu­rate re­sponses to the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>#NEVERBEFOR­ESG is guestcu­rated by de­signer Yang De Rong, 55, who jokes that he had never made so many cold calls be­fore.</p>
    <p>The wholly dig­i­tal show fea­tures works from well-known names such as singer-com­poser Dick Lee, who con­trib­uted an in­ti­mate se­ries of fam­ily wa­ter­colour sketches, to less fa­mil­iar prac­ti­tion­ers.</p>
    <p>Yang says it was a de­lib­er­ate de­ci­sion to steer the show away from “arty” artists. “When we first ex­plored the DNA of the show, I thought, ‘the Na­tional Mu­seum is a peo­ple’s mu­seum, it’s not a se­ri­ous art thing’. So why don’t we ex­plore the state of our lives rather than the state of the arts dur­ing the pan­demic?”</p>
    <p>The re­sult­ing works, pre­sented in nine chap­ters, of­fer a di­verse range of views from cre­atives in dif­fer­ent fields who re­spond in var­i­ous ways to the chal­lenges of pro­duc­ing work dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Pho­tog­ra­pher and In­sta­gram­mer Ivan Kuek, for ex­am­ple, says he hates jog­ging but would run dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker: “It was my only form of ex­er­cise and a chance to get out for some fresh air.”</p>
    <p>He shot some of his pho­to­graphs for Feel­ing Blue, his se­ries for the project, while out on his runs.</p>
    <p>Singer Lee says he was de­clut­ter­ing his be­long­ings dur­ing the pan­demic and un­earthed boxes of fam­ily pho­to­graphs which made him miss his late par­ents and sis­ter: “The lone­li­ness of this whole pan­demic brought on my long­ing to see my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“I have three broth­ers. One of them was in New York. He had Covid, he was stuck at home and we were so wor­ried.”</p>
    <p>This long­ing in­spired him to draw again – “I stud­ied fash­ion de­sign, but I loved il­lus­trat­ing my de­signs more than sewing the clothes” – and a se­ries of fam­ily sketches was born.</p>
    <p>Other con­trib­u­tors drew in­spi­ra­tion from more prac­ti­cal is­sues. Ar­chi­tects Bran­don Lim and Ken­neth Koh brought their tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise to bear on a topic which has caught main­stream at­ten­tion: mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Koh says his work was sparked by the fun­da­men­tal ques­tion: “What is truly a hab­it­able space?”</p>
    <p>Rather than of­fer straight­for­ward build­ing so­lu­tions, the two chose to draw thought-pro­vok­ing images.</p>
    <p>Koh’s work de­picts an M. C. Escher-like con­struc­tion of top­sy­turvy liv­ing spa­ces, while Lim draws par­al­lels be­tween the anony­mous stacks of dor­mi­to­ries and the ubiq­ui­tous vend­ing ma­chines.</p>
    <p>Lim says that the is­sue is se­ri­ous, but “the art style is very ‘car­toony’, it’s meant to be play­ful”.</p>
    <p>Light­ness is also a tone fash­ion de­signer Wykidd Song aimed for when redesign­ing a PPE (per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment) out­fit.</p>
    <p>He says med­i­cal work­ers in PPE can be a scary sight for pa­tients, but he thought about eas­ing the ten­sion with a sur­face print for the out­fits.</p>
    <p>Song’s ver­sions of the out­fits are printed with lit­tle hearts. Each PPE out­fit comes with a pocket where work­ers can slide pho­to­graphs of them­selves, so pa­tients can see what they look like. He says: “It may not al­le­vi­ate the pain of the pa­tients, but it can lighten the stress.”</p>
    <p>Yang adds jok­ingly that they should make all the PPE de­signs and dis­play them on a hos­pi­tal tour.</p>
    <p>His en­thu­si­asm about the project is pal­pa­ble, though he ad­mits that he “got car­ried away”. His orig­i­nal con­cept in­cluded more than nine chap­ters, and he thought of ded­i­cat­ing one to cook­ing and bak­ing, which seemed to be a hot pur­suit dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Since the dig­i­tal do­main is end­less, he muses, per­haps this site can keep go­ing. “This is a very in­clu­sive project, so maybe we should just keep it open and in­vite peo­ple to sub­mit. We de­mys­tify the whole per­cep­tion that you have to know art to see art, or you have to know art in or­der to cre­ate art.”</p>
