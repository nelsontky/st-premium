    <p>Dr Yik Keng Yeong is right to high­light our coun­try’s ex­is­ten­tial threat aris­ing from a dis­mal fer­til­ity rate (Even more needs to be done to en­cour­age hav­ing ba­bies, Nov 11).</p>
    <p>How­ever, hav­ing seen how pre­vi­ous rounds of baby bonus and sup­port mea­sures are not hav­ing much of an im­pact on rais­ing fer­til­ity rates, I’m not op­ti­mistic that throw­ing in more of the same is go­ing to achieve a dif­fer­ent out­come. A com­plete re­think on tack­ling this is­sue is re­quired.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that any­thing in­grained from a young age will have a ten­dency to stay and have a pro­found im­pact on how the in­di­vid­ual will act later in life.</p>
    <p>Is­rael is a small na­tion, yet it punches way above its weight on the fron­tiers of knowl­edge, tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion. This is not sur­pris­ing as re­spect for knowl­edge ac­qui­si­tion is deeply in­grained from a young age.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese are taught from a very young age to be in­volved in chores, clean class­rooms after use and have great con­sid­er­a­tion for oth­ers. Their civic-mind­ed­ness is world-renowned.</p>
    <p>Com­ing back to the is­sue of fer­til­ity, these ex­am­ples show that we have to in­grain the con­cept of the fam­ily from a very young age here.</p>
    <p>This should be in­cor­po­rated in class­room lessons the same way civics ed­u­ca­tion was part of class­room lessons dur­ing ear­lier times.</p>
    <p>To­day, the con­cept of the fam­ily is un­der great threat from many an­gles: work/fi­nan­cial pres­sures tak­ing prece­dence and the urge to self-in­dulge (think travel/ shop­ping/en­ter­tain­ment chan­nels).</p>
    <p>A com­plete re­think of ap­proach to save the fam­ily is what is re­quired some­times.</p>
