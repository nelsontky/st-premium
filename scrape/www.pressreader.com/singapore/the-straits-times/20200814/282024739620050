    <p>I was for­warded an event an­nounce­ment by telco Cir­cles.Life on “How to catch a wild boar in Sele­tar Reser­voir”.</p>
    <p>The $257 work­shop will “take you to the wilder­ness sur­round­ing Up­per Sele­tar Reser­voir to hunt wild boar”, where par­tic­i­pants will be taken through the en­tire process, from “plan­ning and prep to stalk­ing and hunt­ing of the boar”. It prom­ises to be an “im­mer­sive and ex­cit­ing ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>I can­not un­der­stand why the hunt­ing of wildlife in a pro­tected na­ture re­serve would be pro­moted, even as a pub­lic­ity gim­mick. No one would pos­si­bly think of pro­mot­ing, even as a joke, any­thing that is not only clearly il­le­gal but also ab­hor­rent.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it was rea­soned that wildlife crime is not se­ri­ous, that it can be dis­missed as some­thing in­no­cent. After all, hunt­ing wild boar is le­gal in many coun­tries, and wild boar del­i­ca­cies are tra­di­tion­ally pro­duced and sold across much of Asia and Europe.</p>
    <p>Hunt­ing is some­times used as a wildlife con­trol mea­sure in places where pop­u­la­tions of some species are con­sid­ered to be at lev­els that harm the bal­ance of the wider ecosys­tem. But in Sin­ga­pore, wild an­i­mals are pro­tected.</p>
    <p>The Wildlife Act, re­vised only a few months ago, states that “a per­son must not in­ten­tion­ally kill, trap, take or keep any wildlife in any place un­less the per­son has the Direc­tor-Gen­eral’s (of Wildlife Man­age­ment) writ­ten ap­proval to do so”.</p>
    <p>The Wildlife Act was not passed by Par­lia­ment be­cause our MPs are an­i­mal lovers, but for eco­log­i­cal, sci­en­tific rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s na­ture ar­eas are not large and need pro­tec­tion and care­ful man­age­ment if they are to be self-sus­tain­ing.</p>
    <p>By writ­ing this let­ter, I am buy­ing into a mar­ket­ing stunt. But many of us, es­pe­cially in these tough eco­nomic times, want to get be­hind com­pa­nies whose values we ad­mire or whose prod­ucts and at­ti­tudes res­onate with us.</p>
    <p>Re­spect for cul­tural di­ver­sity, gen­der equal­ity, in­clu­sive­ness, and wildlife and the en­vi­ron­ment are just some of the things that are im­por­tant for many Sin­ga­pore con­sumers. We will spend hard-earned money on com­pa­nies we can be­lieve in and feel right sup­port­ing.</p>
    <p>I was both shocked and dis­mayed over the bid for record par­tic­i­pa­tion in a science ex­per­i­ment dubbed Magic Milk (Join in mak­ing Magic Milk at home – and help set a record,</p>
    <p>Aug 8). The ex­per­i­ment in­volves ad­ding dish­wash­ing liq­uid to an en­tire bowl of milk.</p>
    <p>Even in the best of times, it is im­pru­dent to waste food. Given the cur­rent cli­mate when jobs are at risk and those who al­ready live below the poverty line are brac­ing them­selves for worse, such an ex­per­i­ment is most ill-con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing NS Square will give Sin­ga­pore­ans an ad­di­tional venue for leisure and hon­our the his­tory of na­tional ser­vice and its con­tri­bu­tions to Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>(NS Square to be fo­cus of new Ma­rina Bay down­town,</p>
    <p>Aug 10).</p>
    <p>The Ma­rina Bay float­ing plat­form was the venue for the open­ing and clos­ing cer­e­monies of the in­au­gu­ral Youth Olympic Games in 2010, an event that put Sin­ga­pore on the world sport­ing map. I hope there will be some­thing at the NS Square to mark this event.</p>
    <p>It is a good idea to al­low in­vestors to use their SkillsFutu­re cred­its to pay for fi­nan­cial lit­er­acy cour­ses con­ducted by Sin­ga­pore Ex­change and the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) (Fi­nan­cial lit­er­acy para­mount in cur­rent mar­ket cli­mate by Mr Woon Wee Min, Aug 11).</p>
    <p>There are many use­ful cour­ses for which SkillsFutu­re cred­its are not el­i­gi­ble. I hope more flex­i­bil­ity can be ex­er­cised in this as­pect.</p>

    <p>Why are green and white num­ber plates be­ing used to dif­fer­en­ti­ate sim­i­lar bus ser­vices?</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, ser­vice 293 in Tampines, which serves two lines within the neigh­bour­hood, has a green-plate ver­sion and a white-plate one.</p>
    <p>If one for­gets the cor­rect colour plate and boards the bus with the wrong coloured plate, one would have to get down and pay again to take the cor­rect ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Why can’t the ser­vices be num­bered se­quen­tially like 293, 294, 295?</p>
