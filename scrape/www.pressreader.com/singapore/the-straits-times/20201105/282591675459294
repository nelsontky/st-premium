    <p>Diogo Jota beat­ing Ata­lanta goal­keeper Marco Spor­tiello to put Liver­pool in the lead in their Cham­pi­ons League match on Tues­day and score for the fourth straight game in all com­pe­ti­tions. Manch­ester City striker Gabriel Je­sus (be­low) cel­e­brat­ing his goal that helped Pep Guardi­ola’s men to a 3-0 vic­tory over Greek side Olympiakos. The Brazil­ian is ex­pected to start against Liver­pool in the English Pre­mier League on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>JUR­GEN KLOPP, Liver­pool man­ager, giv­ing his full back to Roberto Firmino, who has scored just once in 11 games this sea­son.</p>
    <p>BERG­AMO • Diogo Jota’s su­perb hat-trick lit up Liver­pool’s 5-0 Cham­pi­ons League thrash­ing of Ata­lanta on Tues­day and served fur­ther no­tice to the club’s famed front line that the Por­tuguese striker does not in­tend to play solely a sup­port­ing role.</p>
    <p>The Reds face Manch­ester City in the Pre­mier League on Sun­day and it now seems al­most un­think­able that Jota’s name will not be in the start­ing line-up.</p>
    <p>That may have seemed un­likely at the start of the sea­son when Liver­pool signed the 23-year-old from Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers to pro­vide com­pe­ti­tion to Mo­hamed Salah, Sa­dio Mane and Roberto Firmino, who had de­vel­oped into one of the most feared at­tack­ing trios in football.</p>
    <p>With Firmino’s form un­der the spot­light after an un­der­whelm­ing start to the cam­paign, Jota slot­ted in along­side Salah and Mane and put on a clin­i­cal dis­play of fin­ish­ing be­fore be­ing re­placed by Firmino in the 65th minute.</p>
    <p>“I’m play­ing in the best team of my ca­reer so far, that’s for sure,” Jota told BT Sport after Liver­pool won three out of three in Group D.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know if it was my best mo­ment, but ob­vi­ously scor­ing goals is my way of play­ing football, so I’m re­ally happy with it.”</p>
    <p>Eye­brows were raised when Liver­pool splashed a re­ported £41 mil­lion (S$72.6 mil­lion) to se­cure the sig­na­ture of Jota, who scored 16 goals – nine of them in the Europa League – for Wolves last sea­son.</p>
    <p>He has al­ready be­gun pay­ing back that fee i n earnest with seven goals in 10 games, and he tor­mented the Ata­lanta de­fence to­gether with Mane and Salah, who both scored as well.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously (they are) t wo world-class players, we all know their qual­ity makes it easy for me to do my job be­cause they are out­stand­ing players,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Jota is swiftly de­vel­op­ing a taste for Euro­pean com­pe­ti­tion, hav­ing scored three hat-tricks i n the Cham­pi­ons League and Europa League com­bined since the start of last sea­son – the only player to have done so more than once.</p>
    <p>With a trip to the Eti­had Sta­dium to come, he picked the per­fect mo­ment to stake his claim to a start­ing spot.</p>
    <p>“The clean sheet as well, if we can keep a clean sheet against City we will win the game,” the Por­tuguese added.</p>
    <p>Man­ager Jur­gen Klopp said Jota’s form does not give him a se­lec­tion prob­lem and in­sisted that Firmino still has his full back­ing.</p>
    <p>“Good per­for­mances never give me a headache,” said the Ger­man.</p>
    <p>“For tonight it was clear that it made more sense to use the good shape that Diogo is in and be­cause of the way Ata­lanta plays in de­fence it made sense that the skill set of Diogo helps.</p>
    <p>“The world is some­times a re­ally bad place that when some­one is shin­ing we speak im­me­di­ately of (another) player... and we would not be in the Cham­pi­ons League if not for Bobby Firmino.</p>
    <p>“He will be in the team. Tonight Diogo played a su­per, su­per game but t hat says noth­ing about Bobby.”</p>
    <p>City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola, mean­while, wel­comed the op­tion of hav­ing a striker fit for Sun­day’s block­buster clash after Gabriel Je­sus marked his re­turn from in­jury with a goal to seal a 3-0 Cham­pi­ons League win over Olympiakos.</p>
    <p>Fer­ran Tor­res opened the scor­ing in the 12th minute but City have lacked a ruth­less streak in re­cent weeks in the Pre­mier League with­out a nat­u­ral striker, as Je­sus and Ser­gio Aguero have had an in­jury-hit start to the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Je­sus was in­tro­duced for the fi­nal quar­ter to boost his match fit­ness and took just 11 min­utes to thrash the ball high past Jose Sa to dou­ble City’s ad­van­tage, be­fore Joao Cancelo net­ted the third goal.</p>
    <p>“We played an ex­cep­tional first half, but un­for­tu­nately we can­not fin­ish the games, we strug­gle a bit for the sec­ond goal,” said Guardi­ola, whose team have max­i­mum points in Group C.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nally, an in­cred­i­ble goal from Gabriel (fin­ished the game). In gen­eral, it is good news that he is back.”</p>
    <p>NO STRIKER CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, an in­cred­i­ble goal from Gabriel (fin­ished the game). In gen­eral, it is good news that he is back.</p>
