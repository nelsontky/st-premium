    <p>MANILA • The Philip­pines yes­ter­day said it would ramp up test­ing for the coro­n­avirus amid a spike in in­fec­tions and deaths since a lock­down was eased in June, while Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte threat­ened to ar­rest any­one not wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment is aim­ing to test 32,000 to 40,000 people a day com­pared with the cur­rent 20,000 to 23,000, Health Sec­re­tary Fran­cisco Duque said in a tele­vised meeting with Mr Duterte.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines has tested nearly 1.1 mil­lion people so far, but Dr Duque said the aim was for 10 mil­lion people – or nearly a tenth of the pop­u­la­tion – to be tested by the sec­ond quar­ter of next year. “We can­not test ev­ery ci­ti­zen as no country has done it, even the rich­est, the United States,” Dr Duque added.</p>
    <p>In South-east Asia, the Philip­pines ranks sec­ond to In­done­sia in terms of the num­ber of in­fec­tions and deaths, with cases jump­ing nearly four-fold to 70,764 and deaths nearly dou­bling to 1,837 since the govern­ment re­laxed lock­down mea­sures in June.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, it re­ported two more deaths and 1,951 more in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have also reim­posed lock­downs in some of the hard­est-hit ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Of 30 coun­tries most im­pacted by the pan­demic, the Philip­pines ranked 24th in terms of test­ing rate, statis­tics show.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte has threat­ened to ar­rest any­one found to be spread­ing the virus, re­fus­ing to wear a mask or keep­ing a safe dis­tance from oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“We do not have any qualms in ar­rest­ing people,” Mr Duterte said in a recorded ad­dress aired yes­ter­day. It was a “se­ri­ous crime” to spread the Covid-19 res­pi­ra­tory dis­ease, he added.</p>
    <p>“If you are brought to the po­lice sta­tion and de­tained there, that would give you a les­son for all time,” he said of any­one caught not wear­ing a mask.</p>
