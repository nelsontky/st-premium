    <p>Vet­eran ac­tress Lee He­ung Kam, known for her roles in TVB dra­mas, died in a Hong Kong hos­pi­tal on Mon­day. She was 88.</p>
    <p>Her friend, fel­low ac­tress and opera singer Tam Sin Hung, con­firmed the news to the Hong Kong me­dia.</p>
    <p>She re­vealed that the late ac­tress had had dif­fi­cul­ties swal­low­ing food over the past few days and had been on a liq­uid diet.</p>
    <p>She took a turn for the worse at home on Mon­day and was rushed to the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“Who would have thought that she would be gone just a few hours later?” Tam added.</p>
    <p>Reports in the me­dia said that the ac­tress’ health had de­te­ri­o­rated rapidly in the past month and her fam­ily mem­bers were al­ready men­tally pre­pared for the worst.</p>
    <p>Born on Jan 13, 1932, Lee was a na­tive of Shunde in China’s Guang­dong prov­ince. She spent her child­hood in Ma­cau as her fa­ther ran a rice busi­ness there.</p>
    <p>Lee be­gan her act­ing ca­reer at 16, ap­pear­ing in dozens of drama se­ri­als and movies over the decades.</p>
    <p>In the hey­day of Can­tonese movies, she made a name for her­self play­ing the roles of schem­ing con­cu­bines and em­presses in pe­riod films.</p>
    <p>View­ers of TVB dra­mas may re­mem­ber her as the ruth­less Abbess Miejue in New Heav­enly Sword And Dragon Sabre (1986), act­ing along­side Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Sheren Tang, or as Chow Yun Fat’s long-suf­fer­ing mother in the hit melo­drama se­rial, The Brothers (1980).</p>
    <p>Al­though best known for her TVB dra­mas, Lee jumped ship to ri­val Hong Kong TV sta­tion ATV in 1990. She re­turned to TVB in 2006.</p>
    <p>She was briefly mar­ried to Can­tonese opera star Siu Chung Kwan, with whom she had a daugh­ter. They di­vorced in 1957 and her for­mer hus­band and daugh­ter left for Canada.</p>
    <p>Her daugh­ter, Siu Ji Wan, said in Septem­ber last year that her mother suf­fered from poor mem­ory.</p>
    <p>This was at the fu­neral of fel­low vet­eran ac­tor and Lee’s fre­quent act­ing part­ner Tam Ping Man, which Lee did not at­tend. Tam died at the age of 86 in Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Lee had not ap­peared in pub­lic for a num­ber of years and re­port­edly had mo­bil­ity prob­lems, re­ly­ing on a wheel­chair to get around.</p>
    <p>At that time, Siu stated that her mother was in good health and was “as happy as a child”.</p>
