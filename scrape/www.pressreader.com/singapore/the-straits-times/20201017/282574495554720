    <p>The prom­ise of ‘mo­bil­ity as a ser­vice’ as a path­way to a car-lite so­ci­ety is an il­lu­sion</p>
    <p>South Korean au­to­mo­tive gi­ant Hyundai re­leased a slick video to ac­com­pany a ground­break­ing cer­e­mony of its elec­tric car plant in Jurong this week.</p>
    <p>It gives a peek into the man­u­fac­turer’s fu­ture plans, which – as the clip shows – in­clude pas­sen­ger drones, per­son­alised trans­porta­tion and an as­sem­bly line staffed by white-coated Cau­casians and robots with per­fect dic­tion.</p>
    <p>It is a brave new world, one in which car­mak­ers are no longer con­tent with churn­ing out hun­dreds of thou­sands of iden­ti­cal repli­cas year in and year out.</p>
    <p>From Toy­ota to BMW to Volk­swa­gen, car com­pa­nies all over want to trans­form into “mo­bil­ity so­lu­tion providers”, and are latch­ing on to a new catch­phrase: “Mo­bil­ity as a ser­vice” or MaaS.</p>
    <p>In the new virtual econ­omy, catch­phrases and fancy acronyms are seen to be as im­por­tant as ac­tual sub­stance.</p>
    <p>But what is MaaS, re­ally?</p>
    <p>Hasn’t mo­bil­ity been a ser­vice since the first pre­his­toric man car­ried his in­jured com­rade on a stretcher fash­ioned from drift­wood and mam­moth hide?</p>
    <p>Horse-drawn car­riages, lo­co­mo­tives, buses, taxis, sea ves­sels, planes, mo­tor­bikes and bi­cy­cles – they were and are still MaaS.</p>
    <p>Oh wait, the pur­vey­ors of this rev­o­lu­tion­ary con­cept say that in the MaaS uni­verse, peo­ple do not have to own ve­hi­cles. Rather, they can sum­mon a ride with their phones.</p>
    <p>Ex­cuse me, but we have been able to do that since even be­fore the days of Com­fortDelGro.</p>
    <p>We could pick up the phone, dial the num­ber of our favourite “pi­rate taxi” and it will turn up – sooner or later. Or stand at the kerb, stick an arm out and one will mag­i­cally ap­pear.</p>
    <p>No Wi-Fi needed.</p>
    <p>Sure, ar­rival time was patchy and we of­ten had to share the cab with strangers. But, hey, we had a lot more time on our hands back then. And since there was no pan­demic, no so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>So, MaaS is as old as the hills. It has merely been repack­aged, given a spiffy name and placed on an eye-level shelf lit with bright LEDs.</p>
    <p>In Hyundai’s video, the con­cept is sold con­vinc­ingly. A man in a wheel­chair, whose daugh­ter is about to get mar­ried, looks a lit­tle anx­ious. He is won­der­ing how he will get to the church on time and how he will walk the bride down the aisle.</p>
    <p>Lo and be­hold, his fu­ture son-in-law whips out his fu­tur­is­tic mo­bile phone and, with a few taps, cus­tomises a ride for him.</p>
    <p>The driver­less ve­hi­cle, shaped like an equine trans­porter, turns up, com­plete with a charg­ing port for the man’s elec­tric wheel­chair. Ex­tra brownie points for son-in-law.</p>
    <p>Cut to the church and the bride is wait­ing. The doors open and dad walks in – yes, walks – with the aid of pow­ered leg braces. He is able to ac­com­pany his pre­cious down the aisle af­ter all. Tis­sue, please.</p>
    <p>The clip then goes to the Hyundai plant in Jurong, which looks more like a sci­ence-fic­tion movie set than a car fac­tory.</p>
    <p>In­stead of grease-stained over­alls, work­ers are in all-whites – work­ing hand in hand with robots which dis­pense in­struc­tions in a voice not too dis­sim­liar to HAL9000’s, the de­monic com­puter from Stan­ley Kubrick’s sem­i­nal 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey.</p>
    <p>They as­sem­ble var­i­ous car mod­els, hint­ing at the flex­i­bil­ity of such a fa­cil­ity. But it will be the robots which give the cars the fi­nal in­spec­tion and ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Com­puter screens flash be­spoke or­ders from cus­tomers and the highly au­to­mated hive pro­ceeds to put to­gether th­ese ve­hi­cles, which to­day are ac­ces­si­ble to only the wealth­i­est clients.</p>
    <p>Happy fam­i­lies turn up at the see-through fac­tory. But wait, why would peo­ple with kids in tow show up at a plant in far-flung Jurong to watch MaaS taxis be­ing made?</p>
    <p>Ah, peo­ple will still own cars in the fu­ture af­ter all.</p>
    <p>That is some­what com­fort­ing. Be­cause there are still folks who like the un­beat­able con­ve­nience of pri­vate car own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>You can say what­ever you like about how pay­ing over $100,000 for some­thing you use 11/ hours daily</p>
    <p>2 does not make eco­nomic sense, but the car is there when­ever you need it. And you do not have to share.</p>
    <p>It is the same ar­gu­ment for hav­ing your own bath­room.</p>
    <p>You spend less than an hour a day in it, but it is there – and all yours – when you need it.</p>
    <p>As for MaaS, its prom­ise of be­ing a path­way to a car-lite so­ci­ety is il­lu­sory. It will, in all like­li­hood, lead to more road de­mand, as MaaS op­er­a­tors com­pete for mar­ket share and con­sumers sum­mon rides at the slight­est whim (“Mum, I for­got my his­tory text­book, gonna send GrabAuto to pick it up...”).</p>
    <p>I am still look­ing for­ward to vis­it­ing the Hyundai plant when it is up by end-2022. Maybe I can put on its Stormtroop­er-like gear and walk down the aisle with</p>
    <p>The Im­pe­rial March play­ing over the speak­ers.</p>
