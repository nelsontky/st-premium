    <p>WASH­ING­TON • A 17-year-old Florida boy mas­ter­minded the hack­ing of celebrity ac­counts on Twit­ter, in­clud­ing those of Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den and Tesla chief ex­ec­u­tive Elon Musk, of­fi­cials have said.</p>
    <p>A 19-year-old Bri­tish man and a 22-year-old man in Or­lando, Florida, were also charged un­der US fed­eral law with aid­ing the at­tack, the Jus­tice Depart­ment said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>A Florida pros­e­cu­tor iden­ti­fied the 17-year-old as Gra­ham Clark of Tampa and charged him as an adult with 30 felony counts of fraud.</p>
    <p>Clark net­ted at least US$100,000 (S$137,500) from the scheme by us­ing the celebrity ac­counts to so­licit in­vest­ments from un­sus­pect­ing Twit­ter users, state of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>“He’s a 17-year-old kid who just grad­u­ated from high school,” said Florida state at­tor­ney An­drew Warren in Hills­bor­ough County, which in­cludes Tampa.</p>
    <p>“But make no mis­take: This was not an or­di­nary 17-year-old.”</p>
    <p>Ma­son Shep­pard, the 19-year-old from Bogner Regis, Britain, who used the alias Chae­won, was charged with wire fraud and money laun­der­ing, while Nima Fazeli, the 22-year-old based in Or­lando and nick­named Rolex, was ac­cused of aid­ing and abet­ting the crimes, according to a Jus­tice Depart­ment state­ment.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter said it ap­pre­ci­ated the “swift ac­tions of law en­force­ment”.</p>
    <p>Clark and one of the other par­tic­i­pants were in cus­tody, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>In the hack, fraud­u­lent tweets so­lic­it­ing in­vest­ments in dig­i­tal cur­rency bit­coin were posted in the mid­dle of last month by 45 ver­i­fied Twit­ter ac­counts, in­clud­ing those be­long­ing to Mr Bi­den, for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama and bil­lion­aire Bill Gates.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter said the hack­ers also likely read some di­rect mes­sages, in­clud­ing to a Dutch elected of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Over US$100,000 was ob­tained, the bit­coin pub­lic ledger showed.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter has pre­vi­ously said that its em­ploy­ees were duped into shar­ing ac­count cre­den­tials.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties pro­vided new de­tails on Fri­day in an af­fi­davit al­leg­ing that Clark “used so­cial engi­neer­ing to con­vince a Twit­ter em­ployee that he was a co-worker in the IT depart­ment and had the em­ployee pro­vide cre­den­tials to ac­cess the cus­tomer ser­vice por­tal”.</p>
    <p>StopSIMCri­me founder Robert Ross, whose group tries to com­bat a pop­u­lar hack­ing tech­nique, said the case showed the prow­ess of ado­les­cent am­a­teurs at de­feat­ing cor­po­rate se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“Groups of teens/young­sters are do­ing this en masse,” he said in an e-mail. “It’s re­ally a na­tional se­cu­rity risk.”</p>
