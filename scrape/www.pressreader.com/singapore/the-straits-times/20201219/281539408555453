    <p>As the year-end fes­tive sea­son ap­proaches, Sin­ga­pore is en­sur­ing that there is no let­ting up of safety mea­sures to keep the coro­n­avirus at bay. Start­ing this week­end, there will be more checks on food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets to make sure that safe man­age­ment mea­sures are com­plied with.</p>
    <p>As the year-end fes­tive sea­son ap­proaches, Sin­ga­pore has put its guard up to en­sure that there is no let-up on safety mea­sures to keep the coro­n­avirus at bay.</p>
    <p>Start­ing this week­end, there will be more checks on food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets to make sure that safe man­age­ment mea­sures are be­ing com­plied with, said the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The stepped-up sur­veil­lance will ex­tend over the next few weeks to cover the end-of-year fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The en­force­ment clam­p­down comes at a time when Sin­ga­pore has seen low num­bers of com­mu­nity cases – with none in the past week. The au­thor­i­ties, how­ever, are tak­ing no chances.</p>
    <p>“While we recog­nise that many may wish to meet up with fam­ily and friends dur­ing the fes­tive pe­riod or visit pop­u­lar ar­eas such as Or­chard Road, food and bev­er­age out­lets and mem­bers of the pub­lic must con­tinue to take safe man­age­ment mea­sures se­ri­ously, as din­ing out is an ac­tiv­ity that in­volves con­sid­er­able risks,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Un­der cur­rent rules, so­cial gath­er­ings in groups of more than five are not al­lowed out­side an in­di­vid­ual’s res­i­dence. F&B out­lets, too, are not per­mit­ted to ac­cept book­ings from groups that are larger than five, even if such groups are split across mul­ti­ple ta­bles. Groups are not al­lowed to in­ter­min­gle.</p>
    <p>First-time of­fend­ers will face a fine of up to $10,000 and/or im­pris­on­ment of up to six months.</p>
    <p>From Dec 28, when phase three kicks in, peo­ple will be al­lowed to meet in groups of up to eight.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, vice-dean of global health at the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, said there could still be a low-level spread in the com­mu­nity, since many cases are asymp­to­matic. Sev­eral coun­tries have learnt this the hard way, af­ter fac­ing sec­ond and sub­se­quent waves of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“There­fore it is still im­por­tant to limit so­cial in­ter­ac­tions at this point in time, so we do not sud­denly dis­cover a large clus­ter of in­fec­tions sim­i­lar to what Hong Kong or South Korea ex­pe­ri­enced,” he added.</p>
    <p>Venues such as Tan­jong Beach Club in Sen­tosa said that they are ready for the in­creased checks.</p>
    <p>“We are in­creas­ing the num­ber of our safety am­bas­sadors to en­sure ev­ery­thing runs smoothly and that ev­ery­one is ad­her­ing to the govern­ment rules,” said the beach club’s gen­eral man­ager Chris­tian Hart­mann.</p>
    <p>MSE re­peated that although case num­bers are low, of­fend­ers will face tough ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 re­mains a grave threat and we must re­main vig­i­lant even dur­ing the fes­tive pe­riod. The Govern­ment will not hes­i­tate to take strong en­force­ment ac­tion against op­er­a­tors and in­di­vid­u­als who treat safe man­age­ment mea­sures with fla­grant dis­re­gard,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>“Er­rant op­er­a­tors and in­di­vid­u­als will face fines, tem­po­rary clo­sure, and pros­e­cu­tion to the full ex­tent of the law.”</p>
    <p>On Dec 5, Gemma Steak­house at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore was or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions for 20 days for hold­ing a din­ner for 75 guests in Oc­to­ber and fail­ing to pre­vent mix­ing.</p>
