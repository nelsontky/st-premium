    <p>A group of 15 peo­ple who had gath­ered for a drink­ing ses­sion in a shop­house lo­cated in North Bridge Road are now be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by po­lice for breach­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>A 29-year-old man, who was part of the group of Sin­ga­pore­ans aged between 22 and 40, was also ar­rested for com­mit­ting a rash act.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that the 12 men and three women had gath­ered to drink al­co­hol last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>So­cial gath­er­ings of more than five peo­ple who do not live in the same place of res­i­dence are pro­hib­ited un­der cur­rent Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions. This limit will be ex­panded to eight peo­ple from next Mon­day as Sin­ga­pore en­ters phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>It was past mid­night when the po­lice re­ceived an alert. When of­fi­cers checked out the shop­house on Sun­day, they spot­ted the 29-year-old man try­ing to leave the build­ing via the roof, but he was ar­rested.</p>
    <p>“Upon fur­ther checks, there were 14 other per­sons found in the shop­house, 10 of whom were hid­ing on the rooftop,” said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>For non-com­pli­ance with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, of­fend­ers may be jailed for up to six months or fined up to $10,000, or both.</p>
    <p>For com­mit­ting a rash act, of­fend­ers can be jailed for up to six months or fined up to $2,500, or both.</p>
