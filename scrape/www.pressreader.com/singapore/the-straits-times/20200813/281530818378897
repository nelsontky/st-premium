    <p>At least three peo­ple died in clashes with the po­lice in the In­dian city of Bengaluru, af­ter a Face­book post of­fen­sive to Mus­lims sparked protests in which a po­lice sta­tion was at­tacked, and a politi­cian’s house and ve­hi­cles were torched.</p>
    <p>BENGALURU • At least three peo­ple have died in clashes overnight with the po­lice in the In­dian city of Bengaluru af­ter a Face­book post of­fen­sive to Mus­lims sparked protests in which a po­lice sta­tion was at­tacked, and a politi­cian’s house and ve­hi­cles were torched.</p>
    <p>Un­able to quell protesters us­ing ba­tons and tear gas, be­sieged of­fi­cers opened fire as they risked be­ing over­pow­ered dur­ing the vi­o­lent un­rest in a Mus­lim-dom­i­nated neigh­bour­hood, the south­ern city’s po­lice chief told Reuters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“De­spite elders of the com­mu­nity try­ing to pacify the crowd, the mob burnt ve­hi­cles on the road, they at­tacked the po­lice sta­tion,” Po­lice Com­mis­sioner Ka­mal Pant said.</p>
    <p>“The po­lice had no es­cape and they had to re­sort to fir­ing and three peo­ple died,” Mr Pant said, adding that 110 peo­ple had been ar­rested for al­leged van­dal­ism and at­tack­ing the po­lice.</p>
    <p>A po­lice of­fi­cial said an emer­gency law pro­hibit­ing gath­er­ings had been im­posed in Bengaluru, a city of 12 mil­lion peo­ple best known as In­dia’s Sil­i­con Val­ley.</p>
    <p>Mr Pant said the per­son re­spon­si­ble for the of­fen­sive post has been ar­rested. The post, which re­port­edly in­volved Prophet Mo­hammed, has since been deleted.</p>
    <p>Face­book did not com­ment. “What was writ­ten about the Prophet is the work­ing of a sick mind with an in­ten­tion to cre­ate vi­o­lence,” Congress Party law­maker Di­nesh Gundu Rao said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“It is highly ob­jec­tion­able and such state­ments about any per­son revered by any com­mu­nity needs to be han­dled in the strictest way pos­si­ble by the au­thor­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice gave the first name of the ac­cused man as Naveen, and said he is the nephew of an­other Congress politi­cian, whose house was burnt in the vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>The politi­cian, Mr R. Akhanda Srini­vasa Murthy, ap­pealed for calm in a video mes­sage car­ried by the me­dia. “We’re all broth­ers. What­ever crime has been com­mit­ted, let the law teach them a les­son,” Mr Murthy said. “I ap­peal to our Mus­lim broth­ers and ev­ery­one else to main­tain peace.”</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion chan­nels on Tues­day night showed a group of peo­ple gath­ered out­side a po­lice sta­tion, clashing with of­fi­cers and burn­ing sev­eral po­lice ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The videos showed the group later try­ing to force its way into the sta­tion, and an­other group gath­er­ing out­side the politi­cian’s house shout­ing slo­gans, throw­ing stones, and set­ting fire to ve­hi­cles parked along the road.</p>
    <p>“We are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the is­sue and will make use of CCTV footage to see who is be­hind these vi­o­lent acts, and will take strin­gent ac­tions,” Kar­nataka state home min­is­ter Basavaraj Bom­mai told a news chan­nel.</p>
