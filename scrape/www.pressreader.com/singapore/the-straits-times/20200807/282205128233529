    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • Be­fore the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion sea­son restarted last week, the Mem­phis Grizzlies looked to be naile­don favourites to land the eighth and fi­nal play-off spot in the Western Con­fer­ence, with a 31/ 2- game lead over the Port­land Trail Blazers.</p>
    <p>That gap has now whit­tled to just one game af­ter they fell to their fourth straight de­feat since en­ter­ing the “bub­ble”, los­ing 124-115 to the Utah Jazz at Dis­ney World on</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Joe In­gles led all scor­ers with 25 points as the Jazz moved into fourth place in the West, a halfgame ahead of the Hous­ton Rockets.</p>
    <p>Mem­phis, on the other hand, are now look­ing over their shoul­der as they seek to earn a post-sea­son berth for the first time since 2017.</p>
    <p>Not only are the Blazers clos­ing in on their po­si­tion, but so are the rest of the chas­ing pack. Just two games sep­a­rate them and San An­to­nio Spurs and New Or­leans Pel­i­cans, with the Phoenix Suns a fur­ther half game back.</p>
    <p>If the eighth-placed team does not fin­ish four games ahead of the team in ninth, those teams must play each other to de­ter­mine who makes the play-offs and with only four reg­u­lar-sea­son games left, it looks likely that will be the case.</p>
    <p>To com­pound mat­ters, Mem­phis (32-27) have also lost Jaren Jack­son Jr for the re­main­der of the sea­son ow­ing to a knee in­jury.</p>
    <p>Not only is the for­ward the team’s sec­ond-high­est scorer this sea­son, av­er­ag­ing 17.5 points per game, but he has also been their best player since the league’s re­sump­tion, adding eight points to his usual out­put.</p>
    <p>The Grizzlies are, how­ever, not los­ing faith that they can find a way out of their slump, even with­out Jack­son. Rookie of the Year con­tender Ja Mo­rant, who had 20 points on the night, said: “We’re still fo­cused on which­ever game we’ve got com­ing up.</p>
    <p>“The me­dia are go­ing, ‘Oh, well, they had this lead. Now they have this lead. Some­body is com­ing to take it.’</p>
    <p>“We can’t pay at­ten­tion to that, be­cause that would lead to us try­ing to put pres­sure on our­selves, which we don’t have to.</p>
    <p>“We’re learn­ing from ev­ery­thing we’re go­ing through right now. We’ve got four games left to play, and we’re go­ing to at­tack those games.”</p>
    <p>Mem­phis coach Tay­lor Jenk­ins also in­sisted his team had been un­lucky dur­ing their re­cent run, say­ing: “Our guys are get­ting bet­ter ev­ery sin­gle game.</p>
    <p>“It’s all mag­ni­fied in a four-game stretch where we’re 0-4 and it hasn’t shaken our way, but we’re learn­ing a lot from ev­ery game. We’ve just got to keep gain­ing con­fi­dence from what we’re do­ing.”</p>
    <p>With such an in­tense bat­tle for the last play-off place – the other seven have al­ready been claimed – LeBron James is keep­ing a close eye on the per­mu­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>As the top seeds in the West, the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers will take on who­ever fin­ishes eighth and the for­ward re­vealed he was “see­ing what can pos­si­bly be our match-ups”.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the league con­firmed there were no pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests in its lat­est round of test­ing. No player has yet been in­fected while in­side the “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>STAY­ING IN THE MIX It’s all mag­ni­fied in a four-game stretch where we’re 0-4 and it hasn’t shaken our way, but we’re learn­ing a lot from ev­ery game. We’ve just got to keep gain­ing con­fi­dence from ’’ what we’re do­ing.</p>
    <p>TAY­LOR JENK­INS , Mem­phis Grizzlies coach, is con­fi­dent his play­ers will re­bound from their los­ing streak.</p>
