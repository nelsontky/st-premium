    <p>Elec­tron­ics and fur­ni­ture re­tailer Courts has been fined $9,000 for fail­ing to se­cure cus­tomers’ per­sonal de­tails such as names, mo­bile num­bers and ad­dresses, the se­cond time in two years that it has been found to have breached data pro­tec­tion laws.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a writ­ten de­ci­sion by the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Commission (PDPC) pub­lished last Fri­day, a Courts mem­ber­ship pro­gramme mar­ket­ing e-mail sent out on Aug 31 last year ex­posed the per­sonal data of 76,844 cus­tomers to the risk of unau­tho­rised ac­cess and mod­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The e-mail con­tained a link di­rect­ing cus­tomers to the mem­ber­ship por­tal, where they were sup­posed to log in and pro­vide their mo­bile num­bers as a form of iden­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>But links in pre­vi­ous such e-mails did not re­quire mem­bers to log in, and Courts’ de­fault web­site set­tings failed to take this change into ac­count. This cre­ated an is­sue where if a mem­ber clicked on the link to log in and did not log out within 60 min­utes, all other mem­bers who clicked on the link within the next 60 min­utes would be au­to­mat­i­cally di­rected to his ac­count.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion was not stored in the sys­tem, but mem­bers’ names, dates of birth, mo­bile num­bers and ad­dresses were at risk of be­ing ac­cessed and mod­i­fied ow­ing to the breach.</p>
    <p>Courts was no­ti­fied of the breach by a mem­ber on the same day, and fixed the is­sue some 16 hours af­ter the e-mail was sent out, dur­ing which time 128 mem­bers clicked on the link. The com­pany no­ti­fied all 128 via e-mail, and also im­ple­mented a pass­word ver­i­fi­ca­tion process in Jan­uary this year for any changes made to mem­bers’ ac­count in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“Courts is fully com­mit­ted to the pro­tec­tion of cus­tomers’ per­sonal data. We are re­gret­ful that this in­ci­dent oc­curred and acted swiftly to con­tain it within 16 hours, with min­i­mum im­pact to our cus­tomers,” a Courts spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We proac­tively re­ported the in­ci­dent to the PDPC and co­op­er­ated fully dur­ing its investigat­ion. We ac­cept its de­ci­sion and, fol­low­ing the in­ci­dent, we have re­viewed our (stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures) and con­tinue to con­duct pen­e­tra­tion test­ing on our web­site at reg­u­lar in­ter­vals.”</p>
    <p>PDPC deputy com­mis­sioner Yeong Zee Kin said Courts had failed to con­duct ad­e­quate test­ing be­fore im­ple­men­ta­tion of the new link, not­ing that there was only one em­ployee in charge of cre­at­ing and test­ing the link.</p>
    <p>“The em­ployee con­ducted a lim­ited test of send­ing the (e-mail) con­tain­ing the new (link) to him­self... this lim­ited test was clearly in­ad­e­quate,” Mr Yeong said.</p>
    <p>“Pre-launch test­ing of pro­cesses or sys­tems needs to mimic ex­pected real world us­age... In the present case, the or­gan­i­sa­tion in­tended to send the (e-mail) to a very large number of mem­bers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yeong also noted that this was the se­cond time Courts has been found guilty of a data breach, but added that the fi­nan­cial penalty was re­duced af­ter con­sid­er­a­tion of the com­pany’s fi­nan­cial cir­cum­stances due to the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
