    <p>FIC­TION</p>
    <p>THE MI­MOSA TREE MYS­TERY</p>
    <p>By Ovidia Yu</p>
    <p>Con­sta­ble/ Pa­per­back/</p>
    <p>311 pages/ $18.95/</p>
    <p>Avail­able at bit.ly/Mi­mosaTreeMy­s_Yu</p>
    <p>Fans of home-grown writer Ovidia Yu’s crime mys­tery se­ries fea­tur­ing young Per­anakan sleuth Chen Su Lin will be thrilled to know that the se­ries has legs beyond its three in­stal­ments set in 1930s Sin­ga­pore. But they should brace them­selves for darker fare, as Yu takes on the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>The Mi­mosa Tree Mys­tery opens with a rude shock: Su Lin and her fam­ily are or­dered out of their house be­fore dawn by Ja­panese sol­diers and told to re­port to the school field. Her un­cle is sin­gled out by an in­former and dragged off.</p>
    <p>Su Lin is then ap­proached by the cryptic Hideki Ta­gawa, a pow­er­ful fig­ure in the Kem­peitai, or Ja­panese se­cret po­lice. He of­fers her a deal: to free her un­cle, she must solve the mur­der of her neigh­bour, wealthy busi­ness­man Mirza Ali Has­nain, a Ja­panese in­for­mant who was stabbed to death in his gar­den.</p>
    <p>In the wake of Op­er­a­tion Jay­wick, a 1943 Al­lied raid from Aus­tralia that sank six ships, the Ja­panese are alight with sus­pi­cion – though any num­ber of peo­ple could have killed Mirza, from venge­ful Chi­nese tri­ads to one of his two tac­i­turn daugh­ters, or even the Ja­panese them­selves.</p>
    <p>One of the most en­dear­ing as­pects of the orig­i­nal tril­ogy was its dry sense of hu­mour. Yu is hard-pressed to find any­thing funny in one of the grimmest pe­ri­ods of Sin­ga­pore his­tory, but she does her level best to pre­serve Su Lin’s wry, san­guine voice.</p>
    <p>She also re­tains her knack for con­vert­ing care­ful his­tor­i­cal re­search into lively de­tails, like the Chens’ in­no­va­tive ways of for­ag­ing for food dur­ing wartime.</p>
    <p>Fa­mil­iar char­ac­ters are con­spic­u­ously ab­sent. Half the orig­i­nal cast are ei­ther on the run or pris­on­er­sof-war, in­clud­ing Chief In­spec­tor Thomas Le Froy, Su Lin’s for­mer po­lice boss and men­tor.</p>
    <p>Though his where­abouts are shrouded in mys­tery, he re­mains a pres­ence in the novel, as Su Lin con­stantly asks her­self what he would do in her stead and Hideki, ob­sessed with his meth­ods of in­ves­ti­ga­tion, views him as an arch­neme­sis.</p>
    <p>Yu turns her at­ten­tion to fig­ures not typ­i­cally at the cen­tre of WWII nar­ra­tives, es­pe­cially “col­lab­o­ra­tors” such as Mirza, Emily Ben­ning­ton-Smith, an English­woman turned Ja­panese colonel’s mis­tress and, in­creas­ingly, Su Lin her­self.</p>
    <p>An or­phan with po­lio who has long been an out­cast among her own re­la­tions, she wor­ries that help­ing the Ja­panese with their in­ves­ti­ga­tion will brand her a “run­ning dog” – though, she rea­sons, it is not so dif­fer­ent from her work with the Bri­tish and it will save her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing a Je­sus-mir­a­cle play in which she was cast as a crip­ple, then re­placed by an able-bod­ied girl, she muses: “I learned that fake mir­a­cles have hid­den costs, but also that if you go along with the act, you get cake af­ter the show.”</p>
    <p>Noth­ing is black and white in this less buoy­ant, but nev­er­the­less ab­sorb­ing read.</p>

Re­named Nan­ban, he learns the ruth­less­ness of his masters in or­der to sur­vive.</p>
