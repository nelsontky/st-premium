    <p>As­ses­sors ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Law to deal with dis­putes un­der the rental relief frame­work would be given en­hanced pow­ers to spec­ify the amount of rent to be waived in some cases, un­der pro­posed amend­ments to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed amend­ments in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day will al­low as­ses­sors to spec­ify the amount of rent to be waived un­der the frame­work... In ad­di­tion, the amend­ment Bill will clar­ify an ex­ist­ing part of the Act – not yet in force – that al­lows par­ties of some con­tracts to get relief if they are af­fected by breaches or de­lays in con­struc­tion, sup­ply or re­lated con­tracts.</p>
    <p>As­ses­sors ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) to deal with dis­putes un­der the rental relief frame­work would be given en­hanced pow­ers to spec­ify the amount of rent to be waived in some cases, un­der pro­posed amend­ments to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond time amend­ments have been pro­posed to the Act. In June, the first amend­ments were passed to re­quire land­lords to waive rent for el­i­gi­ble small and medium-sized en­ter­prise ten­ants and sub-ten­ants af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Land­lords who are un­able to reach an agree­ment with these ten­ants on whether the ten­ants are el­i­gi­ble for the rental waivers – the por­tion sup­ported by govern­ment as­sis­tance and/or the por­tion</p>
    <p>borne by the land­lord – can ap­ply to have the as­ses­sors make a de­ter­mi­na­tion.</p>
    <p>They can also get as­ses­sors to de­ter­mine whether they can pro­vide a re­duced amount of waivers, on the ba­sis of fi­nan­cial hard­ship.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed amend­ments in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day will al­low as­ses­sors to spec­ify the amount of rent to be waived un­der the frame­work.</p>
    <p>This will ap­ply when the amount is af­fected by main­te­nance and ser­vice charges, es­pe­cially if they are not listed in the lease or li­cence agree­ment; when the amount could be off­set by as­sis­tance pro­vided ear­lier by the land­lord; when the ten­ant is oc­cu­py­ing the prop­erty for only a part of the relief pe­riod; and when there are mul­ti­ple sub­tenants in the same prop­erty.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the amend­ment Bill will clar­ify an ex­ist­ing part of the Act – not yet in force – that al­lows</p>
    <p>par­ties of some con­tracts to get relief if they are af­fected by breaches or de­lays in con­struc­tion, sup­ply or re­lated con­tracts.</p>
    <p>It will spec­ify that no ap­pli­ca­tion for relief for such con­tracts can be filed if court, ar­bi­tral or Build­ing and Con­struc­tion In­dus­try Se­cu­rity of Pay­ment Act (Sopa) pro­ceed­ings re­lated to the ap­pli­ca­tion have al­ready started.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, once an ap­pli­ca­tion for relief has been filed, the other par­ties of the con­tract can­not com­mence court, ar­bi­tral or Sopa pro­ceed­ings for the same mat­ter, un­til a de­ter­mi­na­tion is made or the ap­pli­ca­tion is re­jected or with­drawn.</p>
    <p>If a de­ter­mi­na­tion is made and the terms of the con­tract are ad­justed, any sub­se­quent ap­pli­ca­tions and de­ter­mi­na­tions made un­der Sopa must be based on the ad­justed con­tract terms.</p>
    <p>In cases where a Sopa ap­pli­ca­tion is made be­fore the other party</p>
    <p>seeks relief un­der the Act, the Sopa ad­ju­di­ca­tor will have pow­ers to grant relief – sim­i­lar to that of the as­ses­sors – to ac­count for the im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The amend­ments to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act will also in­clude con­tin­u­ing to al­low al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments for meet­ings, such as an­nual gen­eral meet­ings, re­gard­less of whether safe dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions change or cease.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, or­gan­i­sa­tions and en­ti­ties are al­lowed to do so un­til Sept 30, but MinLaw said an ex­ten­sion will be an­nounced soon.</p>
    <p>It added that the amend­ments tabled yes­ter­day, if passed, will keep Sin­ga­pore’s le­gal in­ter­ven­tions rel­e­vant and re­spon­sive to the un­cer­tainty from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it is aim­ing for the amend­ments to take ef­fect be­fore the end of the month.</p>
