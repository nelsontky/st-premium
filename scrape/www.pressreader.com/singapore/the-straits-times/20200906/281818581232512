    <p>For many Sin­ga­pore­ans, suc­cess­fully bal­lot­ing for a Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flat in a cen­trally lo­cated ma­ture hous­ing es­tate is akin to strik­ing the lot­tery.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion is stiff in the hotly sought-af­ter es­tates of Toa Payoh and Gey­lang, es­pe­cially for big­ger flats.</p>
    <p>But in the last five years, there has not been a sin­gle five-room BTO flat launched out­side of the Bi­dadari es­tate, which is part of Toa Payoh town.</p>
    <p>The Hous­ing Board has launched 9,273 four-room BTO flats in cen­trally lo­cated ma­ture es­tates since 2015, but only 642 five-room flats in the same time­frame. That is one five-room flat for ev­ery 14 four­room flats.</p>
    <p>The flats are spread out i n Bi­dadari across three BTO pro­jects: Alkaff Vista, Alkaff Oa­sis and Woodleigh Hill­side.</p>
    <p>In Bis­han, Gey­lang, Kal­lang/ Wham­poa and other parts of Toa Payoh, four-room flats have been the big­gest flat type avail­able in re­cent BTO pro­jects.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity mas­ter­plan, the central re­gion com­prises the towns of Bis­han, Toa Payoh, Bukit Merah, Bukit Timah, Gey­lang, Marine Parade, Kal­lang, Novena, Tan­glin and Queen­stown.</p>
    <p>It also in­cludes the South­ern Is­lands and a central area con­sist­ing of, among oth­ers, the Central Busi­ness Dis­trict (CBD) and Or­chard.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Sun­day Times about the lim­ited sup­ply of five-room BTO flats in the last five years, HDB said: “Land for new hous­ing i n these ar­eas is lim­ited. Hence, more four-room and smaller BTO flats are pro­vided to al­low more fam­i­lies to live closer to the city.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, around 500 five­room flats in the central re­gion have been of­fered in the last five years un­der the Sale of Bal­ance Flats ex­er­cises, Re-Of­fer of Bal­ance Flats ex­er­cises and open book­ing of flats. They are l ocated in Bukit Merah, Kal­lang/Wham­poa, Queen­stown and Toa Payoh, among oth­ers, said HDB.</p>
    <p>HDB said four-room flats, which come with three bed­rooms and two bath­rooms, re­main the “main­stay” of HDB’s BTO sup­ply. They are typ­i­cally 90 sq m in size. Five-room flats, which also come with three bed­rooms and two bath­rooms, are slightly larger at 110 sq m.</p>
    <p>In the BTO sales ex­er­cise last month, only pro­jects in ma­ture towns out­side of the central re­gion of­fered five-room flats. These are in Tampines and Pasir Ris in the east and Ang Mo Kio in the north-east.</p>
    <p>The next Bis­han site in the up­com­ing Novem­ber BTO launch will not have any five-room flats ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Only the Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari) site will of­fer five-room flats, along with three-room and four-room flats, for a to­tal of 1,230 units.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts in­ter­viewed said de­creas­ing fam­ily size may play a role, with big­ger fam­i­lies pushed out of the central area.</p>
    <p>“The city cen­tre lo­ca­tions at­tract more younger buy­ers... (who) would pre­fer ac­ces­si­bil­ity con­ve­nience more than flat size,” said Dr Sing Tien Foo, di­rec­tor of the In­sti­tute of Real Es­tate and Ur­ban Stud­ies at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS).</p>
    <p>“With the lim­ited sup­ply, larger fam­i­lies may ei­ther have to pay higher prices for re­sale flats in the city ar­eas or move far­ther away to new or ma­ture es­tates, where more five-room BTO flats are avail­able.”</p>
    <p>NUS As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor of So­ci­ol­ogy Tan Ern Ser said the so­cial char­ac­ter­is­tics of four-room and five­room flat buy­ers may not be “sig­nif­i­cantly dif­fer­ent”.</p>
    <p>“It does mean that those who could af­ford the larger-size flats would be some­what at a dis­ad­van­tage, given that ma­ture towns and res­i­den­tial hous­ing nearer to the CBD are seen as more de­sir­able lo­ca­tion-wise,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Jef­frey Chan, as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign’s hu­man­i­ties, arts and so­cial sciences fac­ulty, said larger flats may be­come more pop­u­lar if work­ing from home be­comes a per­ma­nent trend.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts said it may take time to shift the Sin­ga­porean mind­set of want­ing to live in a central area.</p>
    <p>Dr Sing said: “The pan­demic may have caused some dis­rup­tion to work-home com­mut­ing ar­range­ments... but hous­ing is a lag­gard in de­mand and will take years for the trans­for­ma­tion to take shape. By then, the work-life-play lo­ca­tion bound­ary will be blurred.”</p>
