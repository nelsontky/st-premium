    <p>• Por­tu­gal coach Fer­nando San­tos de­fended his de­ci­sion to start Cris­tiano Ron­aldo on the bench against An­dorra on Wed­nes­day, in­sist­ing the 35-year-old would break the in­ter­na­tional goals record any­way.</p>
    <p>The Ju­ven­tus for­ward edged closer to the all-time record for most in­ter­na­tional goals as Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Por­tu­gal thrashed An­dorra 7-0 in a friendly. He came on as a sub­sti­tute at half-time to net his 102nd goal for Por­tu­gal in the 85th minute. Iran’s Ali Daei holds the record with 109 goals. San­tos said it was only right Ron­aldo did not play the full game, partly be­cause he was re­cently side­lined with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“When it comes to the idea that Cris­tiano Ron­aldo must play (against An­dorra) to score goals and break the record, well, Ron­aldo does not need to score against An­dorra to be­come the top scorer. He will be any­way,” he told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to un­der­stand Ron­aldo didn’t play a game for 19 days dur­ing his lock­down. He’s one of the play­ers who need some min­utes to get a com­pet­i­tive rhythm.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t think it was right to put him on early in the game. An­dorra were play­ing in the last 20 me­tres of the pitch just de­fend­ing and tack­ling. It could be dan­ger­ous for us. We must look care­fully at ev­ery sit­u­a­tion. I am not sure if Ron­aldo was anx­ious to play. But ev­ery player al­ways wants to score goals, for sure.”</p>
    <p>While Ron­aldo played only a half, he had more shots (seven) than any other player as he claimed his 100th in­ter­na­tional vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal, who con­tinue prepa­ra­tions for their Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship ti­tle de­fence next year with a Na­tions League game with France to­mor­row, cruised past An­dorra with lit­tle dif­fi­culty.</p>
    <p>Wolves winger Pe­dro Neto gave them an early lead, be­fore a dou­ble from Paulinho, ei­ther side of a Re­nato Sanches strike, made it four.</p>
    <p>Emili Gar­cia scored an own goal with 14 min­utes to play. Ron­aldo scored the sixth, be­fore Atletico Madrid for­ward Joao Felix wrapped up the scor­ing.</p>
