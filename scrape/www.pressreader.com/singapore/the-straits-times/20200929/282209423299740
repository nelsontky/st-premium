    <p>For the 44 hours be­tween the end of Game 5 and the start of Game 6, Bam Ade­bayo en­gaged in self-flag­el­la­tion. He blamed him­self for the Mi­ami Heat’s in­abil­ity to close out the Bos­ton Celtics last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Ade­bayo had a ca­reer-high 32 points and 14 re­bounds, and Mi­ami booked their trip to the Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion Fi­nals with a 125-113 win over the Celtics near Or­lando.</p>
    <p>“I was locked in. My fam­ily knows how I get when I play bad – es­pe­cially if we lose – I put that on my shoul­ders,” said the cen­tre, who led the team with an av­er­age of 21.8 points per game dur­ing the Eastern Con­fer­ence fi­nals, but was held to 13 points in his pre­vi­ous out­ing.</p>
    <p>“I let my team­mates down in Game 5. So I just had to re­align my­self with who I re­ally want to be­come, and I j ust showed that tonight. You say you haven’t seen me be a scorer in the fourth be­fore.”</p>
    <p>He scored 10 points in the fi­nal quar­ter, when t eam­mate Tyler Herro came alive with 11 of his 19 points. In­clud­ing drib­ble hand-offs, Ade­bayo was in­volved in 14 straight fourth-quar­ter points for the Heat.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami trailed by six with 9min 18sec re­main­ing. Mid­way through the fi­nal pe­riod, Ade­bayo was fouled on a lay-up and made the free throw to put them up 101-100 and they would not trail again.</p>
    <p>“(Ade­bayo) in par­tic­u­lar dom­i­nated that fourth quar­ter,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “Even the plays where he didn’t score, his pres­ence was so im­pact­ful and it</p>
    <p>I HAD TO MAKE IT UP</p>
    <p>I let my team­mates down in Game 5. So I just had to re­align my­self with who I re­ally want to be­come, and I just showed that tonight.</p>
    <p>put us in a bind.”</p>
    <p>Jimmy But­ler fin­ished with 22 points and An­dre Iguo­dala scored a sea­son-high 15 as the Heat ad­vanced to the Fi­nals for the first time since 2014.</p>
    <p>The fifth seeds will face 16-time cham­pi­ons Los Angeles Lak­ers in Game 1 to­mor­row. They are the low­est seeded team to reach the cham­pi­onship se­ries since the eighth­seeded New York Knicks lost to the San An­to­nio Spurs in 1999.</p>
    <p>“We’ll have a very healthy re­spect for our next op­po­nent,” said Heat coach Erik Spoel­stra, who won cham­pi­onships in 2012 and 2013 when Lak­ers star LeBron James played for Mi­ami. “We know who we’re fac­ing.”</p>
    <p>Jaylen Brown had 26 points, Jayson Ta­tum 24 with a ca­reer-high 11 as­sists and Marcus Smart and Kemba Walker 20 apiece for the 17-time cham­pi­ons Celtics, who could not set up a Fi­nals match-up be­tween the two most sto­ried fran­chises in NBA his­tory.</p>
    <p>“Mi­ami de­serves a lot of credit. They’re su­per phys­i­cal, su­per tough and very savvy,” added Stevens. “I think they’re the best team in the East and de­serve to be rep­re­sent­ing the East, the way that they’ve played.”</p>
