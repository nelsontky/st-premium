    <p>The Ger­man Par­lia­ment was this week pushed by op­po­si­tion par­ties to launch a com­mis­sion of in­quiry next Thurs­day into the col­lapse of Ger­man pay­ments firm Wirecard.</p>
    <p>The Wirecard scan­dal has the po­ten­tial to se­verely hurt the rul­ing coali­tion of con­ser­va­tives and so­cial democrats at the polling booth, with just a year to go be­fore a gen­eral elec­tion in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Olaf Scholz, the So­cial Demo­cratic Party’s (SPD) can­di­date in the race to suc­ceed Chan­cel­lor An­gela</p>
    <p>Merkel, is in the cross-hairs of the op­po­si­tion par­ties.</p>
    <p>The SPD, polling a mea­gre 15 per cent in pop­u­lar­ity rat­ings, was hop­ing for some fresh tail­wind when it stood be­hind Mr Scholz for the suc­ces­sion race in a rare show of party unity in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>He is ac­cused not only of poor han­dling of the cri­sis, but also of know­ingly turn­ing a blind eye to the mul­ti­ple warn­ings around Wirecard be­fore the com­pany col­lapsed in June, af­ter ad­mit­ting that €1.9 bil­lion (S$3 bil­lion) in cash was miss­ing from its books.</p>
    <p>His min­istry also oversees the reg­u­la­tory author­ity that has come un­der fire for miss­ing the fraud.</p>
    <p>The strug­gling SPD is hard put to deal with a scan­dal around Mr Scholz, who has so far had an im­mac­u­late rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cally a cen­trist, he is sup­posed to pull votes from the mod­er­ate seg­ment of the elec­torate. This is of ut­most im­por­tance since the SPD un­der a new lead­er­ship has sig­nif­i­cantly moved to the left, alien­at­ing for­mer fol­low­ers. If Mr Scholz comes out of the Wirecard hear­ings po­lit­i­cally com­pro­mised, this could be dev­as­tat­ing for the party.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, all four op­po­si­tion par­ties – the Greens, The Left, the lib­eral-lean­ing Free Demo­cratic Party and the right-wing AfD – voted to go ahead with the com­mis­sion of in­quiry.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion’s pow­ers are far-reach­ing. It can even sum­mon the Chan­cel­lor for a pub­lic grilling.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel, who will leave the chan­cellery next year, also had meet­ings in the past with a for­mer min­is­ter of her Cab­i­net who had turned into a lob­by­ist for Wirecard. She then seemed to have ad­vo­cated in favour of the firm dur­ing a trip to China last year.</p>
    <p>That was when there were al­ready warn­ing signs with re­gard to Wirecard. In 2015, Bri­tain’s Fi­nan­cial Times (FT) be­gan pub­lish­ing a se­ries of ar­ti­cles un­der the tagline House Of Wirecard that pointed to the var­i­ous du­bi­ous prac­tices of the ris­ing fin­tech firm.</p>
    <p>But Ger­many’s fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tory author­ity, the Fed­eral Fi­nan­cial Su­per­vi­sory Author­ity, or BaFin, in­stead of tak­ing the ar­ti­cles se­ri­ously, sued the FT re­porters on sus­pi­cion of mar­ket ma­nip­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel is at­tempt­ing some dam­age con­trol. While un­able to pre­vent the com­mis­sion of in­quiry against Wirecard from be­ing launched, the gov­ern­ing par­ties acted in con­cert to limit its num­ber of mem­bers to nine in­stead of 18. Given the scope of the Wirecard scan­dal, the nine mem­bers will have a hard time sift­ing through the tonnes of doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The Wirecard is­sue has added to the trou­bles of the rul­ing coali­tion, which is still reel­ing from a scan­dal over a car toll sys­tem that would even­tu­ally re­sult in mak­ing for­eign driv­ers pay to travel on the toll-free Ger­man au­to­bahns.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter An­dreas Scheuer, who hails from the SPD’s coali­tion part­ner, the con­ser­va­tive Chris­tian Demo­cratic Union (CDU), has been un­der fire when the project had to be dropped last year af­ter the Euro­pean Court of Justice ruled that mak­ing driv­ers from other coun­tries pay is a form of dis­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is said to have racked up obli­ga­tions to the tune of €500 mil­lion due to pre­ma­turely signed con­tracts with po­ten­tial op­er­at­ing com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>While the SPD and CDU are part­ners in the gov­ern­ment coali­tion, their re­la­tion­ship has not al­ways been smooth. But they seem united in han­dling the scan­dals with vel­vet gloves as they seek to re­duce the pub­lic dam­age.</p>
    <p>In a hear­ing on the car toll scan­dal this week, the So­cial Democrats were al­ready strik­ingly soft on Mr Scheuer.</p>
    <p>“Although he is not fully ex­on­er­ated, there is no in­di­ca­tion that the min­is­ter has lied to Par­lia­ment,” said Ms Kirsten Luh­mann, an out­spo­ken SPD MP. With this SPD verdict, Mr Scheuer, it seems, will sur­vive the car toll sys­tem cri­sis. Now, the SPD is hop­ing for the same out­come for Mr Scholz on Wirecard.</p>
