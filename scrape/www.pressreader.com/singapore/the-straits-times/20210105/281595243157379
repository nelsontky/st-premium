    <p>The Hous­ing Board re­sale mar­ket has re­mained strong de­spite macroe­co­nomic un­cer­tain­ties caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic and an in­creas­ing sup­ply of flats.</p>
    <p>HDB re­sale prices rose 2.9 per cent in the fourth quar­ter of 2020 from the pre­vi­ous three months, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est HDB flash es­ti­mates re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is the third con­sec­u­tive quar­ter of in­crease and the big­gest quar­terly in­crease in over nine years – the last high recorded was in the third quar­ter of 2011, when HDB re­sale prices climbed 3.8 per cent over three months.</p>
    <p>The fourth quar­ter of 2020 also saw the steep­est year-on-year in­crease in HDB re­sale prices since the third quar­ter of 2013, which saw a 6.5 per cent jump.</p>
    <p>For the whole of 2020, re­sale prices rose 4.8 per cent, higher than the 0.1 per cent growth in 2019 and the 0.9 per cent de­cline in 2018.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal fig­ures, with more de­tailed pub­lic hous­ing data, will be re­leased on Jan 22.</p>
    <p>OrangeTee and Tie’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun said the HDB re­sale mar­ket re­cov­ery can be at­trib­uted to the slew of pol­icy changes made over the past two years to make pub­lic hous­ing more af­ford­able and en­hance the at­trac­tive­ness of older flats.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes al­low­ing buy­ers greater flex­i­bil­ity in us­ing their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund to buy older flats and the in­tro­duc­tion of the En­hanced CPF Hous­ing Grant for el­i­gi­ble buy­ers, which has a raised in­come ceil­ing and sim­pli­fied grant struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“Many new flats which com­mand higher prices have also been trans­acted over the past few months, which may have ‘up­lifted’ the over­all price in­dex in the last quar­ter,” said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>A record 72 HDB re­sale flats were sold for over $1 mil­lion in the first 11 months of 2020. They in­clude an HDB re­sale flat at Pin­na­cle@Dux­ton that was sold for a record price of $1.258 mil­lion last Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>This ex­ceeds the pre­vi­ous ful­lyear record of 71 units trans­acted in 2018 and 64 units in 2019.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun ex­pects the prices of HDB re­sale flats to rise by an­other 2 per cent to 5 per cent this year as the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy grad­u­ally re­cov­ers in the sec­ond half of 2021.</p>
    <p>“Cou­ples who are still do­ing well in their j obs may pro­ceed with their up­grad­ing plans, while those who are still af­fected by the pan­demic may down­grade from pri­vate hous­ing to HDB flats. This may re­sult in more flats be­ing put on the mar­ket as well as more flats chang­ing hands in the com­ing months,” she said.</p>
    <p>The long com­ple­tion pe­riod for re­cent Build-To-Or­der launches and ris­ing pri­vate home prices may also di­vert some de­mand to the HDB re­sale mar­ket, she added.</p>
