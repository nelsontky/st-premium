    <p>AMOUNT EARNED BY THIS YEAR’S HIGH­EST-PAID YOUTUBER, NINE-YEAR-OLD RYAN KAJI</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • A nine-year-old boy from Texas in the United States has topped the an­nual list of high­est-paid YouTu­bers com­piled by Forbes mag­a­zine for the third year run­ning, with earn­ings of al­most US$30 mil­lion (S$39.8 mil­lion) this year.</p>
    <p>Child in­flu­encer Ryan Kaji re­views toys and games on his YouTube chan­nel, Ryan’s World, which has 41.7 mil­lion sub­scribers and 12.2 bil­lion views.</p>
    <p>His most pop­u­lar video, Huge Eggs Sur­prise Toys Chal­lenge, has more than two bil­lion views, mak­ing it one of the 60 most-viewed videos on YouTube, ac­cord­ing to The Guardian news site.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the US$29.5 mil­lion he earned from his “un­box­ing” videos, where he re­moves toys from their pack­ages and re­views them, Ryan’s line of branded mer­chan­dise sold at Tar­get, Ama­zon and Wal­mart raked in US$200 mil­lion in sales last year.</p>
    <p>He has also signed a deal with chil­dren’s chan­nel Nick­elodeon for a se­ries called Ryan’s Mys­tery Play­date, re­ported Forbes.</p>
    <p>The business mag­a­zine noted that the top ten earn­ers in its list se­cured an es­ti­mated US$211 mil­lion in to­tal earn­ings from June last year to June this year, a 30 per cent jump from the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic, it said, has boosted business for YouTube, which has been a ma­jor draw for peo­ple stay­ing home.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-high­est earner and new­comer to the list is 22-year-old dig­i­tal celebrity Jimmy Don­ald­son, bet­ter known as MrBeast, who earned an es­ti­mated US$24 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>He is fa­mous for his wild and ex­pen­sive stunts, in­clud­ing blow­ing up a Toy­ota and det­o­nat­ing the world’s most-ex­pen­sive fire­work – a 180kg, US$160,000 de­vice. The 11-minute fire­work episode has nearly 60 mil­lion views.</p>
    <p>An­other child star, Anas­ta­sia Radzin­skaya, known as Nastya, came in sev­enth on the list.</p>
    <p>The six-year-old Rus­sian girl and her fa­ther play with Lego, do house­hold chores and ex­plain viruses on her chan­nel, which has more than 190 mil­lion sub­scribers and 39 bil­lion views. She earned US$18.5 mil­lion for the year.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers in the top 10 in­clude co­me­dian David Do­brik (No. 9), make-up guru Jef­free Star (No. 10) and Mark Fis­chbach or Markiplier (No. 5), who breaks down video games.</p>
    <p>While it may be a good time to be YouTube star, the pan­demic casts a shadow even on them.</p>
    <p>“I just can’t wait un­til we can go back out­side,” Forbes quoted Ryan as say­ing.</p>
