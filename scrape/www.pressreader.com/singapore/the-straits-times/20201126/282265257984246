    <p>In­di­vid­u­als, groups and busi­nesses with sus­tain­abil­ity ideas – such as re­duc­ing waste and ways to mit­i­gate cli­mate change – can now ap­ply for fund­ing for their projects.</p>
    <p>The first grant call for the SG Eco Fund was an­nounced by the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the Environmen­t (MSE) yes­ter­day. Ap­pli­ca­tions will close on Jan 31 next year.</p>
    <p>The $50 mil­lion fund, which was an­nounced by MSE in March dur­ing the Com­mit­tee of Sup­ply de­bate, will sup­port ground-up projects that aim to build a more sus­tain­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants will be ex­pected to co-fund their projects. They may re­ceive fund­ing of up to 80 per cent, sub­ject to a cap of $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the MSE year-end ap­pre­ci­a­tion event at the Environmen­t Build­ing yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the Environmen­t Grace Fu said: “The fund will cover projects in a broad range of ar­eas, from farm­ing and food pro­duc­tion to cli­mate change mit­i­ga­tion and re­silience, re­source ef­fi­ciency and re­cy­cling, and con­ser­va­tion of di­ver­sity.”</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that sus­tain­abil­ity is a col­lec­tive ef­fort, Ms Fu said she hopes the public, pri­vate and peo­ple sec­tors can work to­gether to tackle cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, res­i­dents in Tampines GreenLace used com­post from food waste in a com­mu­nity gar­den­ing ini­tia­tive to grow ed­i­bles such as pas­sion fruit and tapi­oca. This was part of a pi­lot project by MSE on house­hold food waste seg­re­ga­tion, with the help of or­gan­i­sa­tions such as Zero Waste SG and Food­scape Col­lec­tive.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion from the au­di­ence on types of projects the SG Eco Fund would sup­port, Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the Environmen­t Des­mond Tan said one such project would be im­prov­ing re­cy­cling among cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>He said rates of re­cy­cling from re­cy­cling bins are not at an ideal level.</p>
    <p>He also said he hoped to see more ur­ban farm­ing ini­tia­tives, as “it is not just about food re­silience or al­ter­na­tive farm­ing and pro­duc­tiv­ity”, but us­ing ur­ban struc­tures to bring the com­mu­nity to­gether.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu said the cur­rent prob­lem with re­cy­cling is in part due to Sin­ga­pore’s lack of an “es­tab­lished func­tion­ing re­cy­cling in­dus­try”. So more fo­cus should be on “strength­en­ing the waste in­dus­try and find­ing bet­ter ways to ex­tract its value”.</p>
    <p>An­other im­por­tant area would be the rapidly de­vel­op­ing food sec­tor, as there are “many tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tions out there, but not all of them are nec­es­sar­ily ap­pli­ca­ble, and need to be adapted to our lo­cal con­text”, said Ms Fu.</p>
    <p>More thought must also be given to the way the food in­dus­try is struc­tured, so that it is vi­able from a waste-man­age­ment point of view, she said. For in­stance, ar­range­ments can be made for the waste gen­er­ated from aqua­cul­ture to be used to feed live­stock or as fer­tiliser for agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>In the next few years, with more new­com­ers en­ter­ing the mar­ket, there needs to be a struc­tured way for in­dus­try play­ers to ex­change tech­no­log­i­cal know-how and ex­pe­ri­ence with one an­other.</p>
    <p>This would en­sure they do not have to go through the same steep learn­ing curve as ex­ist­ing play­ers, al­low­ing Sin­ga­pore to reach its “30 by 30” goal of pro­duc­ing 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally by 2030, with as few mis­takes as pos­si­ble, said Ms Fu.</p>
