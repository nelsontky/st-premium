    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A It would be when I bought the Bri­tish pound for $1.94. I can’t re­call ex­actly when this hap­pened, but it fell off the cliff to around $1.80. This cost me al­most $30,000 but I do un­der­stand that when it comes to in­vest­ing, some­times you win and some­times you lose. You can’t ex­pect great re­turns all the time.</p>
    <p>Of course, it hurts when you in­cur losses in in­vest­ments, but be­cause there is no proven for­mula or hard-and-fast method for wins, you have to be pre­pared and be able to sus­tain losses if you want to in­vest. What I’ve learnt from my cur­rency (in­vest­ments) is that it is very volatile, as with any other in­vest­ment, which is why I in­vest only 30 per cent of my funds for this.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A The best in­vest­ment would still be the time and ef­fort in build­ing the busi­ness of Global Beauty In­ter­na­tional that I am pas­sion­ate about, which has en­abled us to be at the fore­front of the in­dus­try for many years and stay afloat dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing ef­fort and time in the busi­ness has taught me many things over the last 30 years. I’m still l earn­ing new things ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with a big team means hav­ing to un­der­stand and man­age dif­fer­ent ex­pec­ta­tions and as­pi­ra­tions. To be able to pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties and help staff re­alise their full po­ten­tial is most ful­fill­ing for me.</p>
    <p>I also be­lieve strongly that ser­vice from the heart is very im­por­tant in our in­dus­try, and be­cause of this sin­cer­ity in pro­vid­ing our care and at­ten­tion, many of us have es­tab­lished friend­ships with our clients.</p>
