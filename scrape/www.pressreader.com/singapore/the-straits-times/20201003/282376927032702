    <p>Lo­cal food-pro­duce sup­pli­ers will con­tinue to ben­e­fit from short­ened pay­ment terms and pro­mo­tion of their goods, with the amount of sup­port dou­bled to $2 mil­lion and the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria widened un­der a scheme that helps small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs).</p>
    <p>Lo­cal su­per­mar­ket chain FairPrice on Thurs­day said it will ex­tend the SME Sup­pli­ers Sup­port and De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme for an­other year un­til Oct 31 next year.</p>
    <p>More than 470 SMEs have ben­e­fited from the scheme since 2012.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive was in­tro­duced in 2009 to help the co­op­er­a­tive’s SME part­ners over­come re­struc­tur­ing chal­lenges and tide over a global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme was brought back in 2012 and has been ex­tended an­nu­ally since.</p>
    <p>It usu­ally costs FairPrice more than $1 mil­lion an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>The eighth ex­ten­sion was an­nounced at a launch of the su­per­mar­ket chain’s ninth Made In Sin­ga­pore fair, which pro­vides a plat­form for lo­cal pro­duc­ers to show­case food items.</p>
    <p>Un­der FairPrice’s pro­gramme, as­sis­tance pro­vided in­cludes ac­cel­er­ated pay­ment terms of 30 days in­stead of 60 days and above, dis­counts on pro­cess­ing and listing fees for sup­pli­ers’ new prod­ucts, and spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion for in­clu­sion in the su­per­mar­ket chain’s house-brand scheme.</p>
    <p>FairPrice will en­hance the pro­gramme this year by widen­ing the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria to in­clude more SMEs, in­creas­ing the dis­count on listing fees for new prod­ucts, and pro­vid­ing ad­di­tional mar­ket­ing and pro­mo­tional sup­port.</p>
    <p>It will ex­pand the cri­te­ria on an­nual turnover – from $5 mil­lion to $8 mil­lion – to al­low more sup­pli­ers to be el­i­gi­ble for the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It will also of­fer dis­counts of 50 per cent on both pro­cess­ing and listing fees for their new prod­ucts, up from the 30 per cent dis­count on listing fees pre­vi­ously, in a bid to re­duce SMEs’ business costs and widen op­por­tu­ni­ties for growth.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme’s other new fea­tures in­clude sem­i­nars for en­ter­prises to gain in­dus­try in­sights, a 50 per cent dis­count on sales re­ports and the abil­ity to pro­mote or sell their prod­ucts on FairPrice On­line’s Mar­ket­place plat­form.</p>
    <p>FairPrice car­ries about 6,000 lo­cally made prod­ucts, of which about 35 per cent are from lo­cal SMEs. “Ev­ery bit helps,” said FairPrice group chief ex­ec­u­tive Seah Kian Peng. “Be­ing a lo­cal en­ter­prise, we are do­ing our part to help grow lo­cal en­ter­prises and sup­port our lo­cal prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“Through this, we can help Sin­ga­pore, which we have been do­ing for the past eight years.”</p>
    <p>Mr Thomas Pek, im­me­di­ate past pres­i­dent of Sin­ga­pore Food Man­u­fac­tur­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Tai Hua Food Industries, said FairPrice’s scheme has helped some food busi­nesses that faced a short­age of funds due to the pan­demic, by pay­ing them ear­lier.</p>
    <p>This year’s Made In Sin­ga­pore fair fea­tures about 50 lo­cally made prod­ucts, such as fresh and frozen items and house­hold ne­ces­si­ties.</p>
    <p>It runs un­til Oct 14 at all FairPrice stores and on e-com­merce plat­form FairPrice On­line, of­fer­ing sav­ings of up to 27 per cent.</p>
    <p>Such events are in line with Sin­ga­pore’s broader “30 by 30” goal, said Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try and Man­power Tan See Leng, who checked out the lo­cal prod­ucts on sale at FairPrice’s Our Tampines Hub out­let.</p>
    <p>The 30 by 30 goal is for 30 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s nu­tri­tional needs to be pro­duced lo­cally by 2030.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan added: “Be­cause the Covid-19 pan­demic has rav­aged many economies, we want to now achieve ‘30 by 30’ even ear­lier.”</p>
    <p>On Sept 25, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and FairPrice On­line rolled out an ini­tia­tive to help lo­cal food man­u­fac­tur­ers di­ver­sify their rev­enue streams.</p>
    <p>Called Yum­mySG!, it is hosted on FairPrice On­line’s Mar­ket­place plat­form, bring­ing to­gether lo­cal prod­ucts to pro­vide higher vis­i­bil­ity to con­sumers and dif­fer­en­ti­ate them from other goods.</p>
