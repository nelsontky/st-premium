    <p>A chil­dren’s novel set dur­ing the Hun­gry Ghost month, a trav­el­ogue about the Sino-Ti­betan fron­tier and an ab­sur­dist novel by a Ser­bian writer who shares Sin­ga­pore’s birth­day of Aug 9 are among the new ti­tles in this month’s round-up of new Sin­ga­pore-re­lated books.</p>
    <p>1 NON-FIC­TION</p>
    <p>THE “OTHER” SHANGRI-LA</p>
    <p>By Shivaji Das</p>
    <p>Konark Pub­lish­ers/ Pa­per­back /</p>
    <p>190 pages/$21.40/</p>
    <p>Avail­able at bit.ly/OtherShang­ri-la_SD</p>
    <p>Travel writer Das (left) chron­i­cles his voy­age to the Sino-Ti­betan fron­tier, an as­tound­ingly scenic and po­lit­i­cally fraught moun­tain re­gion that in­spired the leg­endary utopia Shangri-La – though the re­al­ity proves far more com­plex.</p>
    <p>In his trav­el­ogues, Das, a man­age­ment con­sul­tant who started Sin­ga­pore’s Mi­grant Worker Po­etry Com­pe­ti­tion in 2014, prefers to stray from the beaten path.</p>
    <p>This time, he trav­els with his wife Yolanda Yu to places such as Li­tang, a town sit­u­ated at an al­ti­tude of more than 4,000m, and Larung Gar, which is ar­guably both the world’s largest monastery and high­est slum.</p>
    <p>In light, as­tute prose, he de­scribes cus­toms such as ear-clean­ing in a tea­house, a beauty con­test in Danba and a sky burial, in which the de­ceased is de­voured by birds and scaveng­ing an­i­mals.</p>

    <p>6 SHEZLEZ THE SELF-PRO­CLAIMED</p>
    <p>By Marko Vign­je­vic</p>
    <p>Ethos Books/ Pa­per­back/ 121 pages/ $19.90/</p>
    <p>Avail­able at bit.ly/SSelfP_MV</p>
    <p>Much is sur­real about this novella: its ab­sur­dist plot, the eye in the slice of ham on its cover – taken from Rene Magritte’s 1935 paint­ing The Por­trait – and even the odd con­flu­ence of events that pro­duced it.</p>
    <p>It was writ­ten by Vign­je­vic (left), a Ser­bian who hap­pens to share Sin­ga­pore’s birth­day of Aug 9, and pub­lished here by Ethos Books in the wake of July’s Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Set in an un­named, highly bu­reau­cratic coun­try, it fol­lows Shezlez, a poor man who finds un­ex­pected fame af­ter mak­ing im­pas­sioned speeches at the Thresh­ing Floor, a pub­lic space where peo­ple gather to voice their griev­ances.</p>
    <p>Shezlez at­tempts to start his own po­lit­i­cal party and run for elec­tion, but gets em­broiled in shad­owy schemes of power even as his cam­paign takes on a life of its own.</p>
    <p>Vign­je­vic, 42, ap­proached Ethos on­line. Though the Ethos team re­jected the English trans­la­tion of his Ser­bian novel, Father’s Milk, it ex­pressed in­ter­est in Shezlez, which is in­spired by 1990s Ser­bian pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“The world of Shezlez is un­can­nily sim­i­lar to our lo­cal po­lit­i­cal cli­mate,” says the Ethos team in an e-mail in­ter­view, “so we could re­late to and be amused by the ab­sur­di­ties that the char­ac­ters find them­selves em­broiled in.</p>
    <p>“The sparse and ax­iomatic lan­guage of Marko’s (book) made the story seem stranger than fic­tion, al­most pre­scient, and was some­thing un­usual that de­vi­ated from the type of lan­guage that we’d come to ex­pect.”</p>
    <p>It is a co­in­ci­dence that the book ended up com­ing out in an elec­tion year, it adds.</p>
    <p>Vign­je­vic, who has pub­lished seven books – three in Ser­bian and the rest in English – says ab­sur­dism was the nat­u­ral choice for Shezlez. “It lends it­self to the no­tion of one in­di­vid­ual’s strug­gle find­ing its clo­sure in pol­i­tics.”</p>
    <p>7 CHIL­DREN’S</p>
    <p>THE HUN­GRY GHOST</p>
    <p>By H. S. Norup</p>
    <p>Pushkin Chil­dren’s Books/ Pa­per­back/ 256 pages/ $16.91/ Avail­able at bit.ly/Hun­gryGhost_HSN</p>
    <p>In this heart­warm­ing chil­dren’s novel that is more sweet than spooky, Freja, 12, moves from her Dan­ish home town to Sin­ga­pore to live with her father’s new fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Home­sick for Den­mark, wary of her step­mother and des­per­ately lonely, she tries to be­friend the strange, long-haired girl in a white dress whom she keeps see­ing in the gar­den – un­aware that her house is near Bukit Brown Ceme­tery and it is the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Soon, she and her new friend, Ling, stum­ble into an oth­er­worldly realm in­hab­ited by myth­i­cal be­ings such as dragons, phoenixes and pon­tianaks.</p>
    <p>There, they must try to find out who Ling was be­fore the sev­enth month ends and she has to re­turn to the un­der­world un­re­mem­bered. Yet it is not only Ling whose buried mem­o­ries need ex­ca­vat­ing, but also Freja.</p>
    <p>Norup, a Dan­ish chil­dren’s au­thor now based in Switzer­land, lived in Sin­ga­pore for four years and counts Bukit Brown as one of her favourite places on the is­land.</p>
