    <p>• Rus­sian qual­i­fier and world No. 292 Anas­ta­sia Gasanova claimed the big­gest scalp of her ca­reer on Satur­day, only to crash out in the fourth round of the sea­son-open­ing WTA Abu Dhabi event a day later.</p>
    <p>Gasanova sent Czech f ormer world No. 1 Karolina Pliskova pack­ing in straight sets with a 6-2, 6-4 third-round vic­tory in 72 min­utes, record­ing her first vic­tory over a player in the top 100.</p>
    <p>But she could not main­tain her mo­men­tum yes­ter­day with Spain’s Sara Sor­ribes Tormo seal­ing a 7-5, 6-3 win to move into the last eight.</p>
    <p>The world No. 66 will take on Ukraine’s 99thranked Marta Kostyuk, who beat Slove­nia’s Ta­mara Zi­dansek 6-1, 6-1, to­day.</p>
    <p>Still Gasanova, mak­ing her main draw de­but here, was happy with her run.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally sur­prised...” the 21-year-old said of beat­ing the world No. 6 Pliskova. “Ac­tu­ally, I had thought I would lose in qualies (sic) or some­thing like that, but I just kept push­ing my­self, like, I need to win and I want to win.”</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s other round-of-16 matches, sixth seed Elena Ry­bak­ina of Kaza­khstan moved into the next round with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Rus­sia’s Daria Kasatk­ina. She will face Be­laru­sian Aryna Sa­balenka, who has yet to drop a set here and is on a 12-match win streak, to­day.</p>
    <p>The world No. 19 has only once played her 10thranked op­po­nent be­fore, los­ing in 2019 in Wuhan, but re­gard­less of the out­come, it is all about build­ing as much match fit­ness as pos­si­ble for Ry­bak­ina.</p>
    <p>After the Abu Dhabi event con­cludes on Wed­nes­day, she will fly to Mel­bourne to begin her twoweek quar­an­tine ahead of the Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>“At this tour­na­ment, I’m not ex­pect­ing much,” Ry­bak­ina told the WTA web­site. “I’m just try­ing to find the rhythm and play lots of matches.</p>
    <p>“I think with ev­ery match, I will get bet­ter and bet­ter and soon, I can show my best, but I think it’s like 50 per cent now. It’s still not so close to the best.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lot to im­prove and it’s not easy to catch the rhythm that I had at the be­gin­ning of 2020 (reach­ing four WTA fi­nals and win­ning one in the first two months) be­cause after the pan­demic, it was dif­fi­cult to start again.</p>
    <p>“I think only in the end of the sec­ond half of the year, I started to play bet­ter and bet­ter but al­ready the year was fin­ished, so it was re­ally crazy. So hope­fully, now I can play a lot of matches now.”</p>
