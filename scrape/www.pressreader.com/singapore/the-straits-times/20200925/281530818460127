    <p>Over 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore in­vestors re­main in­vested in the mar­kets even as the value of their port­fo­lios shrank due to the eco­nomic fall­out from the coronaviru­s outbreak.</p>
    <p>This is ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey re­leased yes­ter­day by in­vest­ment man­age­ment firm Fi­delity In­ter­na­tional of 2,434 in­vestors across four Asian mar­kets – Sin­ga­pore, China, Hong Kong and Ja­pan – con­ducted be­tween July 29 and Aug 3.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found that Sin­ga­pore had the high­est pro­por­tion of in­vestors who said that the value of their in­vest­ments has been re­duced by “a lot” as a re­sult of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, 86 per cent of Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents were still in­vested in their port­fo­lios – the high­est pro­por­tion among the four mar­kets. On av­er­age, about 82 per cent of all re­spon­dents in the four mar­kets said they re­mained in­vested.</p>
    <p>Four out of 10 in Sin­ga­pore have kept their port­fo­lios un­changed since the pan­demic started, while about 22 per cent have in­creased their in­vest­ments. Nearly a quar­ter re­bal­anced their al­lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>A “large” pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents also plan to raise their as­set al­lo­ca­tion as a re­sult of the pan­demic, es­pe­cially in equities and unit trusts or in­vest­ment funds, Fi­delity said.</p>
    <p>For those choos­ing to in­vest more in unit trusts or funds, the most popular as­set class was equities, fol­lowed by real es­tate and fixed in­come.</p>
    <p>Only 3 per cent of Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents had re­deemed all their in­vest­ments since the on­set of the outbreak. About 8 per cent re­deemed some of their in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>In terms of the pan­demic’s im­pact on sen­ti­ment, in­vestors in the citys­tate were the most anx­ious about money, out of the four mar­kets polled. Two-thirds said they felt more wor­ried about money amid the outbreak.</p>
    <p>About half of them also said Covid-19 has neg­a­tively af­fected their fi­nan­cial well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents were also the most con­fi­dent about their sav­ings suf­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>To min­imise the fi­nan­cial im­pact of the pan­demic, nearly six in 10 in­vestors in Sin­ga­pore re­duced their dis­cre­tionary spend­ing, while 47 per cent cut the amount of money saved.</p>
    <p>Re­tire­ment plan­ning was one of the big­gest wor­ries as a re­sult of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>One in four Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents ex­pected to de­lay their re­tire­ment and ex­tend their full-time ca­reer, while one in five ex­pected to have a phased re­tire­ment by work­ing part-time for longer.</p>
    <p>Fi­delity In­ter­na­tional head of South-east Asia and Mid­dle East Lawrence Han­son said the sur­vey find­ings showed that a ma­jor­ity of in­vestors are tak­ing a long-term view of the mar­ket and their fi­nances.</p>
    <p>“This is pos­i­tive, be­cause it tells us that in gen­eral, in­vestors are not mak­ing knee-jerk re­ac­tions and draw­ing down on in­vest­ments. They would rather ad­just daily spend­ing habits than sac­ri­fice longterm port­fo­lio gains,” he added.</p>
