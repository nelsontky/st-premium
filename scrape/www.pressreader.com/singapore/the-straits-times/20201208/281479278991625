    <p>In­done­sia has re­ceived 1.2 mil­lion doses of a Covid-19 vaccine made by China’s Si­no­vac, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The doses – the first batch of Covid-19 vac­cines for In­done­sia – ar­rived in Jakarta late on Sun­day on a flight from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties are now draft­ing the rules gov­ern­ing their dis­tri­bu­tion across the coun­try, a task that is ex­pected to be com­pleted within two weeks. An­other 1.8 mil­lion doses will ar­rive next month.</p>
    <p>The first batch of Covid-19 vac­cines has ar­rived in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The world’s largest archipelag­ic state is now draft­ing the rules gov­ern­ing their dis­tri­bu­tion across the coun­try, a task that is ex­pected to be com­pleted within two weeks.</p>
    <p>At about 9pm lo­cal time on Sun­day, 1.2 mil­lion doses of the vaccine de­vel­oped by China’s Si­no­vac Biotech reached Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta air­port.</p>
    <p>From there, they were taken to Ban­dung, West Java province, to be stored at state-run drug­maker Bio Farma’s fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>An­other 1.8 mil­lion doses of the Si­no­vac vaccine will ar­rive in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Air­langga Har­tarto, head of the na­tional Covid-19 task force, said: “The ar­rival and avail­abil­ity of the vac­cines will be grad­ual. The vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme will be car­ried out grad­u­ally as well, with pri­or­ity given to med­i­cal work­ers and pub­lic ser­vice of­fi­cers.”</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing yes­ter­day at a vir­tual me­dia brief­ing with sev­eral other min­is­ters tasked with procur­ing vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment will adopt a dual ap­proach for the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, with some get­ting the shots free of charge and oth­ers foot­ing the cost of their own vac­ci­na­tion, said Mr Air­langga, who is also the Co­or­di­nat­ing Eco­nomic Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Those who would have to pay fall un­der the so-called “Mandiri” scheme, with vac­ci­na­tion avail­able on a first-come, first-served ba­sis.</p>
    <p>They will get to choose the vaccine brand they want among those avail­able.</p>
    <p>It is not clear when the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme will start. But of­fi­cials have said that Jan­uary is the ear­li­est In­done­sia could roll it out.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day night, Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo said that BPOM, In­done­sia’s in­de­pen­dent food and drug agency, would have to give emer­gency ap­proval for the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme to start.</p>
    <p>He added that, prior to the pro­gramme roll-out, the dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tem across the coun­try’s 34 prov­inces – in­clud­ing its more than 500 re­gen­cies and cities – must be fi­nalised.</p>
    <p>“Once we de­cide on a date for the start of our vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, ev­ery­thing would have to be ready,” Mr Joko said, adding that sup­port­ing equip­ment, hu­man re­sources and a pre­pared dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tem must first be in place.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Sri Mulyani In­drawati said dur­ing the same brief­ing that her of­fice has al­lo­cated funds to the Health Min­istry, as well as the re­gional govern­ments (in­clud­ing cities and re­gen­cies), to op­er­ate the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Some 10,134 Puskesmas (com­mu­nity health cen­tres) and 2,877 hos­pi­tals across In­done­sia would be in­volved in the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has pro­cured hun­dreds of vaccine re­frig­er­a­tors and other sup­port­ing equip­ment, in­clud­ing vaccine car­ri­ers, cold boxes and sy­ringes, Ms Sri Mulyani added.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has so far se­cured com­mit­ments for the ship­ment of 189 mil­lion vaccine doses from China’s Si­no­vac, Mary­land-based No­vavax and Covax, an in­ter­na­tional Covid-19 vaccine al­lo­ca­tion plat­form co-led by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s pop­u­la­tion is 270 mil­lion and the plan is for 107.2 mil­lion of them – those aged 18 to 59 – to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Those with pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions or deemed un­fit will not be in­cluded in the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has also set aside a buf­fer of 15 per cent for its vaccine stock­pile.</p>
    <p>At two doses per per­son, it would thus need 247 mil­lion doses in its stock­pile by next year.</p>
