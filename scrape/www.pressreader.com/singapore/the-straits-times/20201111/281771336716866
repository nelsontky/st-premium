    <p>•</p>
    <p>SAO PAULO/BEI­JING Brazil’s health reg­u­la­tor has sus­pended a clin­i­cal trial for China’s Si­no­vac Covid-19 vac­cine, cit­ing a se­vere ad­verse event, sur­pris­ing the trial or­gan­is­ers who coun­tered that there had been a death but it was un­re­lated to the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The health reg­u­la­tor, An­visa, on Mon­day said the event oc­curred on Oct 29 but did not spec­ify if it was in Brazil or an­other coun­try. It also did not say how long the sus­pen­sion might last.</p>
    <p>The trial is one of three large late-stage tri­als un­der way for the Si­no­vac vac­cine. How­ever, the vac­cine has faced con­tro­versy i n Brazil, with Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro dis­miss­ing it as l ack­ing cred­i­bil­ity. He also reg­u­larly ex­presses anti-Chi­nese sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>The set­back to Si­no­vac’s ef­forts con­trasts with good news from Pfizer, which said its ex­per­i­men­tal</p>
    <p>Covid-19 vac­cine is more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive based on ini­tial trial re­sults.</p>
    <p>Mr Di­mas Co­vas, the head of Sao Paulo’s med­i­cal re­search in­sti­tute Bu­tan­tan which is con­duct­ing the Si­no­vac trial, said the reg­u­la­tor’s de­ci­sion was re­lated to a death but added that he found it strange “be­cause it’s a death un­re­lated to the vac­cine”.</p>
    <p>“As there are more than 10,000 vol­un­teers at this mo­ment, deaths can oc­cur... It’s a death that has no re­la­tion with the vac­cine and, as such, it is not the mo­ment to in­ter­rupt the tri­als,” Mr Co­vas told lo­cal broad­caster TV Cul­tura.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac said in a state­ment on its web­site yes­ter­day that it was con­fi­dent of the safety of its vac­cine and will con­tinue to com­mu­ni­cate with Brazil on the mat­ter. It pre­vi­ously said it ex­pected in­terim re­sults of late-stage tri­als this year.</p>
    <p>It is not un­com­mon for clin­i­cal tri­als to be sus­pended tem­po­rar­ily – some­times for as short as a week – af­ter a vol­un­teer dies or takes ill, so that trial or­gan­is­ers can check whether the event is re­lated to the drug be­ing tested.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac’s vac­cine is among the three ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 vac­cines that China has been us­ing to in­oc­u­late hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple un­der an emer­gency use pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>A Chi­nese health of­fi­cial said on Oct 20 that se­ri­ous side ef­fects had not been seen in clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>Brazil has more than 160,000 dead and over 5.6 mil­lion con­firmed cases of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
