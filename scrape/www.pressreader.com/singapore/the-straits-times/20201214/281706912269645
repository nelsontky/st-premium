    <p>• The au­thor­i­ties have vowed to crack down on work­ers who went on a vi­o­lent ram­page at a Tai­wanese-run iPhone fac­tory in south­ern In­dia over al­le­ga­tions of un­paid wages and ex­ploita­tion, with 100 peo­ple ar­rested so far.</p>
    <p>Work­ers at Wistron In­fo­comm Man­u­fac­tur­ing’s fa­cil­ity on the out­skirts of Ban­ga­lore ri­oted on Satur­day, with footage of the vi­o­lence show­ing glass pan­els smashed and cars flipped on their sides. CCTV cam­eras, fans and lights were torn down, while a car was set on fire.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia re­ported work­ers say­ing they had not been paid for up to four months and were be­ing forced to do ex­tra shifts.</p>
    <p>A lo­cal trade union leader al­leged “bru­tal ex­ploita­tion” of work­ers in sweat­shop con­di­tions at the iPhone man­u­fac­tur­ing plant.</p>
    <p>“The state govern­ment al­lowed the com­pany to flout ba­sic rights,” Mr Satyanand, who uses one name, told The Hindu news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Po­lice yes­ter­day said spe­cial teams had been set up to in­ves­ti­gate the in­ci­dent and that no one had been in­jured in the vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>“We will en­sure that all work­ers’ rights are duly pro­tected and all their dues are cleared,” Kar­nataka state’s deputy chief min­is­ter C. N. Ash­wath­narayan tweeted.</p>
    <p>There was no im­me­di­ate re­sponse from Wistron. The fac­tory em­ploys some 15,000 work­ers, although a ma­jor­ity of them are con­tracted via staffing firms.</p>
    <p>Labour un­rest is not un­com­mon in In­dia, with work­ers paid poorly and given few or no so­cial se­cu­rity ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment in Septem­ber passed up­dated labour laws that the na­tional govern­ment said would strengthen work­ers’ rights, but ac­tivists say the new laws make it harder for work­ers to strike.</p>
    <p>Else­where in In­dia, tens of thou­sands of farm­ers yes­ter­day in­ten­si­fied their protests against three new agri­cul­tural laws aimed at over­haul­ing food grain pro­cure­ment and pric­ing rules by al­low­ing pri­vate firms direct ac­cess to the vast agrar­ian sec­tor.</p>
    <p>An­gry farm­ers staged protests near New Delhi af­ter re­ject­ing Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s as­sur­ances that the laws would dou­ble farm­ers’ in­come. Six rounds of talks be­tween of­fi­cials and farmer union lead­ers have failed to re­solve the dis­pute.</p>
