    <p>On June 18, global fin­tech com­pany Wire­card ad­mit­ted that large parts of its Asia busi­ness were mis­rep­re­sented and that €1.9 bil­lion (S$3 bil­lion) in cash re­ported on their fi­nan­cial state­ments did not ex­ist.</p>
    <p>Five days later, the com­pany filed for bank­ruptcy pro­tec­tion from cred­i­tors, and Wire­card’s share price col­lapsed from more than €100 to less than €3.</p>
    <p>In the largest au­dit­ing scan­dal since En­ron, Wire­card’s au­dit­ing firm of more than 10 years did not carry out even ba­sic au­dit­ing pro­ce­dures such as check­ing di­rectly with banks to con­firm that Wire­card held large amounts of cash in these banks.</p>
    <p>While most ex­perts will fo­cus on de­ci­pher­ing du­bi­ous ac­count­ing prac­tices and puz­zling au­dit­ing fail­ures, this ar­ti­cle will fo­cus on three non-au­dit­ing is­sues.</p>
    <p>None of these is­sues were in­di­ca­tors of po­ten­tial fraud but, com­bined, they start to look sus­pi­cious. Ad­mit­tedly, how­ever, every­thing looks ob­vi­ous in hind­sight.</p>
    <p>REG­U­LA­TORY CRACKS</p>
    <p>Be­fore the earth-shat­ter­ing scan­dal last month, Wire­card was a global fin­tech com­pany with its head­quar­ters in Ger­many. It started in 1999 by help­ing web­sites col­lect pay­ments from cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>More specif­i­cally, it op­er­ated on the fringes of elec­tronic pay­ment pro­cess­ing busi­ness ser­vic­ing on­line gam­bling com­pa­nies and porno­graphic web­sites.</p>
    <p>While tra­di­tional pay­ment pro­cess­ing com­pa­nies stayed away from these sec­tors due to high risk and small mar­gins, Wire­card filled the gap.</p>
    <p>As the past two decades wit­nessed a plethora of busi­nesses mov­ing on­line and away from tra­di­tional cash pay­ments, this dar­ling of the fin­tech in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­enced spec­tac­u­lar growth. In 2018, Wire­card be­came a pay­ment pro­cess­ing giant worth al­most €25 bil­lion and was in­cluded in the pres­ti­gious Ger­man blue-chip in­dex – the DAX.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Wire­card ac­quired XCOM in 2006, the re­named sub­sidiary was li­censed to is­sue credit cards and han­dle money on be­half of mer­chants.</p>
    <p>Thus Wire­card be­came a fin­tech hy­brid with bank­ing and non-bank­ing op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>These hy­brid fin­tech firms are not sub­ject to the same rules as banks and fi­nan­cial firm. If a com­pany does not meet the typ­i­cal thresh­old of 50 per cent of its busi­ness in lend­ing and tak­ing de­posits, it is not scru­ti­nised like the banks.</p>
    <p>Hence, while Ger­many’s fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tor BaFin reg­u­lated Wire­card’s bank­ing arm, it did not do the same for its pay­ments pro­cess­ing busi­ness, which fell through reg­u­la­tory cracks.</p>
    <p>RE­VERSE TAKEOVER</p>
    <p>Founded in 1999, the com­pany was listed in 2005 via a re­verse takeover of a de­funct call cen­tre group which was pub­licly listed.</p>
    <p>A re­verse takeover or a re­verse merger is the process of go­ing pub­lic via a back-door list­ing. In short, the pri­vate com­pany buys shares of a pub­lic com­pany and takes con­trol. So ef­fec­tively, the pri­vate com­pany be­comes a pub­licly traded one. This al­lows the pri­vate com­pany to trans­fer its busi­ness op­er­a­tions into the pub­lic en­tity and by­pass the com­plex process of go­ing pub­lic via ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) – a much more com­mon method for go­ing pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with IPO, re­verse mergers hap­pen at much lower costs, in much shorter time and with few reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments and lit­tle over­see­ing. Also known as back-door list­ing, this un­usual method avoids the in­tense scru­tiny and reg­u­la­tory pro­ce­dure of a typ­i­cal list­ing via IPO. started bawl­ing at the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Ms Chen had also re­cently lost her grand­fa­ther, who died at 95 af­ter a long pe­riod of suf­fer­ing. He lived in Tai­wan, where death in very old age is treated as a cel­e­bra­tion, Ms Chen said. And yet there had been a lot of fam­ily con­flict</p>
    <p>Sev­eral have doc­u­mented that re­verse merger firms are typ­i­cally smaller, less prof­itable and riskier than IPO firms, con­sis­tent with the no­tion that re­verse merger is a way for smaller and less de­vel­oped firms to be­come pub­licly listed.</p>
    <p>No­to­ri­ously, a boom in re­verse mergers of China-based firms in the United States ended due to a se­ries of fi­nan­cial scan­dals in 2011, when more than 20 of such com­pa­nies were delisted and as many as 42 out of 150 were ac­cused of fraud.</p>
    <p>PRICE MA­NIP­U­LA­TION VER­SUS PRICE DIS­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>Short-sellers had ex­pressed con­cerns about Wire­card as early as July 2014, but ev­ery time they were met with ac­cu­sa­tions of price ma­nip­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, when the Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported claims of forged doc­u­ments in Wire­card’s Asia head­quar­ters in Jan­uary last year, oddly, BaFin launched a probe into the FT around the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>A few years later she met Dr Mark Zhang, a pal­lia­tive care physi­cian and tech­nol­o­gist, at an MIT health care “hackathon”. The pair won first place at the event and went on to found Cake. The plat­form now in­cludes re­sources and tem­plates to re­port­ing and an al­leged at­tempt at share price ma­nip­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>In an un­prece­dented move, BaFin im­posed a ban on short-sell­ing of Wire­card’s shares a month later. Even though BaFin banned the short-sell­ing of banks dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2008 due to con­cerns of price ma­nip­u­la­tion, this was the first time that Ger­many’s watch­dog had banned the short-sell­ing of a sin­gle com­pany.</p>
    <p>In 2016, short-sellers un­der the pseu­do­nym Zatarra pub­lished money-laun­der­ing al­le­ga­tions against Wire­card. Again, BaFin started in­ves­ti­gat­ing the ac­cusers for al­leged price ma­nip­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter, crit­ics of Wire­card started re­ceiv­ing “spear-phish­ing” e-mails in an on­line bul­ly­ing at­tempt.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, Wire­card hired KPMG to con­duct a spe­cial au­dit, but the au­di­tors were not able to clear the com­pany.</p>
    <p>De­spite short-sellers’ al­le­ga­tions of Wire­card’s trans­gres­sions since 2014, it was not un­til June this year that EY, its au­di­tor of more than 10 years, re­fused to sign its fi­nan­cial state­ments due to fraud con­cerns.</p>
    <p>It was only in June that BaFin stopped blam­ing whistle­blow­ers, jour­nal­ists, in­vestors and short-sellers and started prob­ing Wire­card.</p>
    <p>The ex­am­ple of Wire­card shows the value of short-sell­ing when viewed from the per­spec­tive of price dis­cov­ery and not price ma­nip­u­la­tion. The non-au­dit­ing is­sues should have given rise to sus­pi­cion among in­vestors and, es­pe­cially, Ger­many’s fi­nan­cial watch­dog.</p>
    <p>While in­vestors and BaFin can­not go back in time for a do-over, they can, at least, pay more at­ten­tion to sim­i­lar con­cerns in fu­ture.</p>

    <p>The ven­ture-backed firm makes money through part­ner­ships and will even­tu­ally add fee-based ser­vices. The pan­demic has been an es­pe­cially busy time for it. Cake’s ser­vices, for ex­am­ple, soon will be in­te­grated into the web­site of the Bri­tish bank RBS/NatWest.</p>
    <p>Cake has also teamed up with Prov­i­dence Health Sys­tem, a net­work of 51 hos­pi­tals and 1,000 clin­ics in seven states across the US, to share its doc­u­ment spec­i­fy­ing an in­di­vid­ual’s med­i­cal pref­er­ences if the per­son be­comes in­ca­pac­i­tated. Through Cake, in­di­vid­u­als could sub­mit the form to their doc­tor with­out need­ing a no­tary and two non-fam­ily wit­nesses, which are of­ten re­quired but dif­fi­cult to get un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The next step is of­fer­ing pre­mium ser­vices, tai­lored to dif­fer­ent types of users.</p>
    <p>THE PAN­DEMIC HITS</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the on­go­ing pan­demic, con­do­lence-re­lated traf­fic on Cake dou­bled. To ad­dress the need, the com­pany started a fo­rum where users can crowd­source their ques­tions and con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Lantern pro­vides its own grief and con­do­lence con­tent, in­clud­ing a “pan­demic-proof” guide to “in­clu­sively ad­dress­ing grief at work”.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially dur­ing Covid-19, it’s how can you in­cor­po­rate the griev­ing process into 9-to-5 and day-to­day work?” said Ms Alica Forneret, 31, who runs grief work­shops and just started a name­sake con­sult­ing agency to help com­pa­nies ad­dress this ques­tion.</p>
    <p>For Ms Forneret and other such mil­len­nial founders, pre­par­ing for death and nav­i­gat­ing grief dur­ing the pan­demic has be­come a form of self-care.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been called a niche mar­ket,” she said. “But death and dy­ing is pos­si­bly the least niche mar­ket out there.” Cor­po­ra­tions are re­think­ing the well­ness pro­grammes they’re of­fer­ing em­ploy­ees, her co­founder, Ms Eddy, said.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have found that be­ing able to talk about your mor­tal­ity makes you a hap­pier per­son and im­proves your re­la­tion­ships. The think­ing, for em­ploy­ers per­haps, is that ac­cess to end-of-life ser­vices can make peo­ple hap­pier and more pro­duc­tive at work.</p>
    <p>The ba­sic pre-plan­ning ser­vices at Cake and Lantern are free. Given that the av­er­age cost of a fu­neral in the US last year was US$7,640 (S$10,600), this kind of fore­sight could re­duce the cost of dy­ing.</p>
    <p>“We’re never go­ing back to the way it was,” Ms Chen said. “That’s a pos­i­tive thing – to ac­cept the re­al­ity that we’re not im­mor­tal.”</p>
