    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) has de­ter­mined that a for­mer di­rec­tor of its East Asian In­sti­tute (EAI) had be­haved in­ap­pro­pri­ately with a sub­or­di­nate by hug­ging her with­out her con­sent dur­ing a work meet­ing.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment is­sued yes­ter­day, the univer­sity said Pro­fes­sor Zheng Yong­nian’s be­hav­iour “was in­ap­pro­pri­ate in a pro­fes­sional set­ting” and had breached the univer­sity’s code of con­duct for staff.</p>
    <p>He would have been given a writ­ten warn­ing ac­cord­ingly, but as he has left the in­sti­tute, NUS recorded the out­come of its in­ter­nal re­view in its staff records, it said.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous sex­ual ha­rass­ment al­le­ga­tions in­volv­ing Prof Zheng, 58, had sur­faced in Au­gust and Septem­ber on so­cial me­dia, with so­cial me­dia users – who iden­ti­fied them­selves as NUS staff – ac­cus­ing him of ha­rass­ing them.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the state­ment, the aca­demic, who spoke through his lawyers, main­tained his in­no­cence and said it was a “con­so­la­tory hug” given as the staff mem­ber was leav­ing his of­fice in May 2018. He said the staff mem­ber had looked dis­ap­pointed af­ter he told her that his daugh­ter was not in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She had ex­pressed in­ter­est in be­friend­ing his daugh­ter, said Prof Zheng, who left the univer­sity in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>In its lat­est state­ment, NUS said it “be­came aware” of the al­le­ga­tions in May last year and sus­pended Prof Zheng on May 20 that year.</p>
    <p>He was re­quired to work from home and stay off the NUS cam­pus while in­ves­ti­ga­tions were be­ing con­ducted. Prof Zheng was also pro­hib­ited from con­tact­ing the EAI staff mem­ber, said NUS.</p>
    <p>The po­lice sub­se­quently ad­min­is­tered a stern warn­ing to Prof Zheng in April this year for out­rage of mod­esty, re­lat­ing to this case.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing this, NUS ap­pointed a Com­mit­tee of In­quiry (COI) in July to re­view the com­plaints, and de­ter­mined that at least one of the staff mem­ber’s al­le­ga­tions had oc­curred.</p>
    <p>While Prof Zheng ad­mit­ted to hug­ging the staff mem­ber with­out her con­sent, the COI could not es­tab­lish the “ve­rac­ity of the al­le­ga­tion that Prof Zheng had pat­ted or touched her but­tocks in the ab­sence of ev­i­dence”, said NUS.</p>
    <p>It also could not es­tab­lish that he had held the staff mem­ber’s back while tak­ing a group pic­ture, and had placed his hands on her shoul­der and head dur­ing a meet­ing be­tween the two in his of­fice – as the af­fected staff mem­ber had al­leged.</p>
    <p>Prof Zheng and the af­fected staff mem­ber were in­formed of NUS’ find­ings ear­lier this week, and the univer­sity said it will con­tinue to sup­port the staff mem­ber.</p>
    <p>How­ever, both Prof Zheng and the so­cial me­dia user who claimed to be the af­fected staff mem­ber have ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment in the univer­sity’s ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Prof Zheng said “it is ex­tremely re­gret­table that NUS would pro­vide (sup­port to) and tol­er­ate some­one who has falsely ac­cused oth­ers and has fre­quently at­tacked oth­ers in so­cial me­dia”.</p>
    <p>The af­fected staff mem­ber had made what he said were defam­a­tory re­marks about him in e-mails sent to the Chi­nese Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion, var­i­ous uni­ver­si­ties, and scholar com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>He added that he had treated her po­litely and pro­fes­sion­ally, and noted that the po­lice report against him was made a year af­ter the in­ci­dent, “only af­ter” he de­clined to be her PhD su­per­vi­sor and co-au­thor for a pa­per.</p>
    <p>“Why isn’t NUS pro­tect­ing its own pro­fes­sor who has worked for the univer­sity for more than 20 years? Did NUS ever con­sider the pres­sure and dis­tress I suf­fered dur­ing this pe­riod of investigat­ion as a re­sult of the false ac­cu­sa­tion mounted by the EAI staff?”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the so­cial me­dia user who iden­ti­fied her­self as the af­fected staff mem­ber posted on Twit­ter that she was dis­ap­pointed with NUS’ investigat­ion. She said NUS was still try­ing to pro­tect Prof Zheng, and noted that the univer­sity is “try­ing to blur the bound­aries of ‘sex­ual ha­rass­ment’ and ‘in­ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour’”.</p>
    <p>“This is not ‘in­ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour’, it is il­le­gal,” she said.</p>
