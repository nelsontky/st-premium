    <p>•</p>
    <p>The White House that United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump woke up in on Tues­day was in full-blown chaos, even by the stan­dards of the havoc of the Trump era.</p>
    <p>Aides said the Pres­i­dent’s voice was stronger af­ter his re­turn from the hos­pi­tal on Mon­day night, but at times, he still sounded as if he was try­ing to catch air.</p>
    <p>The West Wing was mostly empty, cleared of ad­vis­ers who were out sick with the coro­n­avirus them­selves or told to work from home rather than in the cap­i­tal’s most fa­mous virus hot spot.</p>
    <p>Staff in the White House res­i­dence were in full per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, in­clud­ing yel­low gowns, sur­gi­cal masks and dis­pos­able pro­tec­tive eye cov­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 last week, was still livid at his chief of staff, Mr Mark Mead­ows, whose ef­fort last Satur­day to tamp down the rosy por­trait of Mr Trump’s con­di­tion given to re­porters by his chief doc­tor was caught on cam­era.</p>
    <p>Other of­fi­cials were an­gry with Mr Mead­ows for not even try­ing to con­trol the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Some aides tried to project con­fi­dence. “We feel com­fort­able work­ing here, those of us who are still here,” Ms Alyssa Farah, the White House com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor, said in an in­ter­view on Fox News. But many saw the sit­u­a­tion as spi­ralling out of con­trol.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic that Mr Trump had treated cav­a­lierly for months seemed to have locked its grip on the White House.</p>
    <p>West Wing aides, shaken by polls show­ing the Pres­i­dent badly trail­ing Mr Joe Bi­den, wor­ried that they were liv­ing through the fi­nal days of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The dis­ar­ray was, at the same time, spread­ing across Washington. Al­most the en­tire Joint Chiefs of Staff, in­clud­ing its chair­man, Gen­eral Mark Mil­ley, went into quar­an­tine on Tues­day af­ter com­ing in con­tact with Ad­mi­ral Charles Ray, vice-com­man­dant of the Coast Guard, who tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the num­ber of White House staff in­fected with the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ued to rise, with a senior ad­viser, Mr Stephen Miller, along with a press of­fi­cer, join­ing one of Mr Trump’s valets and a mil­i­tary aide in test­ing pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Mi l l e r ’ s w i f e K a t i e , a spokesman for Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, con­tracted the virus in May but re­cov­ered. Mr Pence tested neg­a­tive on Tues­day, his physi­cian said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>At least 22 peo­ple tied to re­cent White House in­ter­ac­tions have con­tracted the coro­n­avirus, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Late in the day, the stock mar­ket col­lapsed when Mr Trump abruptly called off talks for a con­gres­sional coro­n­avirus re­lief Bill af­ter the Fed­eral Re­serve chair­man, Mr Jerome Pow­ell, said such a stim­u­lus was badly needed.</p>
    <p>Some White House staff won­dered whether Mr Trump’s be­hav­iour was spurred by the cock­tail of drugs he has been tak­ing to treat the coro­n­avirus, in­clud­ing dex­am­etha­sone, a steroid that can cause mood swings and give a false level of en­ergy and a sense of eu­pho­ria.</p>
    <p>Staff said the Pres­i­dent was glad to be back in the White House af­ter spend­ing four days and three nights at Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre, which aides said made him feel as if he was in a cage.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent sup­port­ers of the ad­min­is­tra­tion said Mr Trump should have stayed at the hos­pi­tal un­til he was no longer in­fec­tious or should re­main con­fined to his res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>“When a boss comes down with Covid, whether that boss is the pres­i­dent, a CEO, a prin­ci­pal at a school... and the boss shows up for work, it sends a very wor­ri­some mes­sage to all of those around the boss,” said Mr Ari Fleis­cher, a for­mer press sec­re­tary to Pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush. “There is a com­mu­nity of peo­ple who work in the White House, not just po­lit­i­cal ap­pointees. A good boss al­ways takes care of his or her em­ploy­ees.”</p>
