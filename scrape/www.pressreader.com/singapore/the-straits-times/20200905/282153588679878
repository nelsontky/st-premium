    <p>Sin­ga­pore can im­prove on how it cares for some of the more vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of its so­ci­ety, such as peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and mi­grant work­ers, said Work­ers’ Party MP Gerald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Here is an edited ex­cerpt of his speech:</p>
    <p>I raised dis­abil­ity is­sues seven years ago dur­ing my pre­vi­ous term in Par­lia­ment, specif­i­cally about im­prov­ing pub­lic trans­port and pedes­trian in­fra­struc­ture ac­ces­si­bil­ity for the vis­ually im­paired. I am glad to see that some progress has been made since then, al­though some gaps still re­main.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, most junc­tions with traf­fic lights still don’t have au­di­ble pedes­trian sig­nals, and for those that do, they have the chirp­ing sound turned off at 9pm or 10pm to avoid dis­turb­ing nearby res­i­dents. This could pose a safety risk for vis­ually im­paired pedes­tri­ans who are out at night.</p>
    <p>I hope the Min­istry of Trans­port will re­con­sider my pro­posal to add vi­bro­tac­tile walk in­di­ca­tions at these cross­ings. These are spe­cial but­tons po­si­tioned at the traf­fic sig­nals which vi­brate when it is safe to walk...</p>
    <p>In my con­ver­sa­tions with per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties (PWDs), the No. 1 is­sue on their minds is jobs – not un­like for many other Sin­ga­pore­ans. They are not ask­ing for hand­outs, but more equal op­por­tu­ni­ties in em­ploy­ment...</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has done well to pro­vide schemes like the En­abling Em­ploy­ment Credit and the As­sis­tive Tech­nol­ogy Fund. These need to be com­ple­mented with bet­ter pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion, for both em­ploy­ers and the gen­eral pub­lic, in or­der to clear mis­con­cep­tions about PWDs in the work­place.</p>
    <p>We also need to en­sure that em­ploy­ers do not dis­crim­i­nate on the ba­sis of dis­abil­ity, by in­tro­duc­ing anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other area that needs to move for­ward faster with the times is our ap­proach to means test­ing for so­cial as­sis­tance schemes. The process of­ten re­quires too much pa­per­work.</p>
    <p>We al­ready have the ca­pa­bil­ity to in­te­grate and au­to­mate such sys­tems... Can we now de­velop the same ca­pa­bil­i­ties for dis­burs­ing so­cial as­sis­tance to de­serv­ing in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies?</p>
    <p>My third area of con­cern is help­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans cope with the bur­den of health­care ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Chronic diseases are im­pos­ing an in­creas­ing bur­den on our age­ing pop­u­la­tion...</p>
    <p>I have two sug­ges­tions for the Health Min­istry to con­sider. First, that Medis­ave with­drawals be al­lowed for the treat­ment of all chronic con­di­tions, not just those on the Chronic Dis­ease Man­age­ment Pro­gramme list. This will en­sure that no one is ex­cluded just be­cause they suf­fer from a less com­mon chronic con­di­tion. Se­cond, the an­nual with­drawal lim­its for Medis­ave should be re­moved for pa­tients with suf­fi­cient Medis­ave bal­ances and are over the age of 60. To re­duce the risk of a buf­fet syn­drome, these two changes can be rolled out first at poly­clin­ics and restructur­ed hos­pi­tals....</p>
    <p>My fourth area of con­cern is the wel­fare of mi­grant work­ers. These are some of the most dis­ad­van­taged yet in­vis­i­ble mem­bers of our so­ci­ety...</p>
    <p>At the heart of many of the is­sues that mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore face is their lack of bar­gain­ing power vis-a-vis other par­ties like em­ploy­ers, the Gov­ern­ment and em­ploy­ment agen­cies...</p>
    <p>I urge the Man­power Min­istry to step up en­force­ment and in­tel­li­gence gath­er­ing, so that er­rant par­ties will be taken to task and be made an ex­am­ple of.</p>
    <p>We could also set up a jobs por­tal for em­ploy­ers to list avail­able jobs so that work­ers don’t have to go through in­ter­me­di­aries to find new com­pa­nies to work for once their con­tracts end...</p>
    <p>It has been said that the true mea­sure of any so­ci­ety can be found in how it treats its most vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers.</p>
    <p>We have come so far as a coun­try, up­lift­ing the stan­dard of liv­ing of gen­er­a­tions of our peo­ple. Let us take this progress to the next level as we fur­ther im­prove how we care for the vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers in our so­ci­ety.</p>
