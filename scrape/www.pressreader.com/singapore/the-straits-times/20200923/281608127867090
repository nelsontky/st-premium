    <p>All Covid-19 pre-de­par­ture test re­sults for trav­ellers from In­dia en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore must come from recog­nised labs which are in­ter­na­tion­ally ac­cred­ited or en­dorsed by the In­dian gov­ern­ment, said Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>Those with­out the re­quired valid doc­u­ments will not be al­lowed into the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, from to­day, all trav­ellers – in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents – with a re­cent travel his­tory to In­dia within the last 14 days be­fore com­ing to Sin­ga­pore will have to take a serol­ogy test. The test de­tects the pres­ence of an­ti­bod­ies and can show if the per­son might have been in­fected.</p>
    <p>Those who test pos­i­tive will be ex­empted from tak­ing the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion swab test – which de­tects the pres­ence of vi­ral ge­netic ma­te­rial – be­fore the end of their two-week stay-home no­tice (SHN) pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The lat­est di­rec­tive to pro­duce valid pre-de­par­ture test re­sults from recog­nised labs comes as faked test re­sults are be­com­ing in­creas­ingly com­mon in In­dia, with re­ports of agents and doc­tors tak­ing bribes to pro­duce them.</p>
    <p>This re­quire­ment also fol­lows a sig­nif­i­cant jump in im­ported cases from In­dia, with the grad­ual eas­ing of travel rules and loos­en­ing of the coun­try’s border re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In the five days from last Thurs­day to Mon­day, two-thirds of Sin­ga­pore’s im­ported cases, or 61 per cent of them, had vis­ited In­dia.</p>
    <p>MOH said last Fri­day that there will be two lev­els of checks – one at the air­port in In­dia be­fore board­ing, and the other at the ar­rival im­mi­gra­tion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Trav­ellers found with­out the re­quired valid doc­u­ments will be re­fused en­try into Sin­ga­pore. We will not hes­i­tate to take ac­tion against those who present forged doc­u­ments to seek en­try into Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing bar­ring them from en­try to Sin­ga­pore in the fu­ture,” warned the min­istry.</p>
    <p>This new and more strin­gent border re­stric­tion comes in ad­di­tion to ex­ist­ing re­quire­ments – a twoweek SHN pe­riod at ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties and a fur­ther neg­a­tive Covid-19 test be­fore the end of the SHN pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“This cov­ers the full in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod of Covid-19, and has been ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing spread into our lo­cal com­mu­nity,” MOH as­sured.</p>
