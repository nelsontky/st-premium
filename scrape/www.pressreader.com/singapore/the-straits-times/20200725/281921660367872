    <p>Quiet streets, empty ta­bles at restau­rants, and de­serted malls, karaoke cen­tres and mas­sage par­lours have be­come a com­mon sight on the In­done­sian hol­i­day is­land of Batam, just a ferry ride away from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Many busi­nesses, par­tic­u­larly ho­tels and travel agen­cies, on the is­land have been badly hit by the coro­n­avirus out­break since March, when the first pos­i­tive cases in In­done­sia were an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Batam Cen­tre Ferry Ter­mi­nal, which pre­vi­ously was bustling with tourists, mostly from Sin­ga­pore, has turned into a ghost port as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic keeps stores shut­tered and vis­i­tors at home.</p>
    <p>Shop rents have been slashed by half but busi­nesses, from fash­ion to food, have stayed shut­tered. But as long as they do not close for good, “their rents would be re­duced even if they don’t op­er­ate”, port worker Santi, 45, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Batam is lo­cated in the Riau Is­lands, a sprawl­ing prov­ince of more than a thou­sand is­lands known lo­cally as Kepri.</p>
    <p>The prov­ince ac­counts for the sec­ond-high­est num­ber of in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors to In­done­sia af­ter Bali. Of the 2.59 mil­lion for­eign tourists who vis­ited In­done­sia in 2019, mainly to Batam and Bin­tan, nearly half were from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>While some of those who lost their jobs in Batam have re­turned to their home­towns, those who stayed on have strug­gled to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>Food server Riswandi, 34, said he had to move in with a friend to save costs af­ter his work­place, a pop­u­lar restau­rant sell­ing sup tu­lang, or beef bone soup, shut down. “I need to find a new job, but even to find work as a restau­rant helper is not easy in these hard times,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Rida Hara­hap, 23, a ther­a­pist at First Choice Spa and Mas­sage cen­tre, said she used to serve five cus­tomers a day be­fore the coro­n­avirus struck, but “even get­ting one now is dif­fi­cult”. Half of the com­pany’s 40 ther­a­pists have re­turned to their home­towns, she said.</p>
    <p>“Even with a 50 per cent dis­count for each spa and mas­sage ser­vice, busi­ness is still quiet. I don’t know how long I can last in this job.”</p>
    <p>Provin­cial tourism chief Bu­ral­i­mar told ST he hoped the two coun­tries could re­open bor­ders as soon as pos­si­ble, with health safe­guards in place, adding: “Our tourism in­dus­try will surely re­cover if Sin­ga­pore­ans visit Kepri again.”</p>
    <p>On July 2, In­done­sian Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ments Luhut Pand­jai­tan called Sin­ga­pore For­eign Min­is­ter Vivian Balakrishn­an and they dis­cussed the im­por­tance of keep­ing up pos­i­tive bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion even amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) said in a July 3 state­ment that “the call did not go into any spe­cific dis­cus­sions on tourism ex­changes and co­op­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is grad­u­ally re-open­ing our bor­ders in a pro­gres­sive and cal­i­brated man­ner, while en­sur­ing the health and safety of Sin­ga­pore­ans and our in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors... Sin­ga­pore­ans are still ad­vised to de­fer all travel abroad,” the MFA state­ment added.</p>
