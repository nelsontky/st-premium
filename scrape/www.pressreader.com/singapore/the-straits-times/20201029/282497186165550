    <p>The minis­eries A Suit­able Boy is set in India in the early 1950s when proper be­hav­iour for young women was far more re­stric­tive than it is today.</p>
    <p>In the six-episode his­tor­i­cal drama, based on the 1993 novel of the same name by Vikram Seth, In­dian ac­tress Tanya Manik­tala plays Lata, a univer­sity stu­dent from a well-to-do fam­ily seek­ing her own path even as her fam­ily plans an ar­ranged mar­riage for her. The se­ries is avail­able on Net­flix. “Lata never fit into her pe­riod. She is a modern woman who is fo­cused on her ca­reer. Love was never her fi­nal des­ti­na­tion. That made it easy for me to play her,” Manik­tala, 23, tells The Straits Times over the tele­phone from her home city of New Delhi.</p>
    <p>The theme of the ar­ranged mar­riage – with all its drama and con­flict – has been ex­plored in Asian shows for decades, but it is one that she be­lieves still mat­ters.</p>
    <p>“It’s still preva­lent i n India. Today, we might have pre­con­ceived no­tions about ar­ranged mar­riages, but Lata’s older sis­ter Savita is mar­ried to a man cho­sen by her mother. She is very happy with that ar­range­ment,” she says.</p>
    <p>These days, Lata’s ro­man­tic predica­ment stem­ming from her sense of in­de­pen­dence is the norm rather than the ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>“Times have changed. Young peo­ple are as­sert­ing them­selves when it comes to the choice of part­ners,” Manik­tala says.</p>
    <p>“Even par­ents who think they want the best for their child know that, ul­ti­mately, it’s up to the per­son who is ac­tu­ally in that sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>The char­ac­ters mostly speak English, with some Hindi and Urdu. Their use of full sen­tences and clear enun­ci­a­tion is not an af­fec­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Mira Nair (2001 drama Mon­soon Wed­ding) wanted ac­tors to have pe­riod-au­then­tic speech pat­terns.</p>
    <p>“We had a dic­tion coach on set with us to make sure we didn’t rush or mum­ble,” Manik­tala says. “We watched doc­u­men­taries from the 1950s to pick up the way peo­ple spoke. We saw that they waited to think about what they were go­ing to say be­fore they said it.”</p>
    <p>She was se­lected to play Lata, a star­ring role in a multi­na­tional pro­duc­tion, de­spite this be­ing only her sec­ond cred­ited role as an ac­tress.</p>
    <p>“To be hon­est, I was in­tim­i­dated and over­whelmed at the be­gin­ning,” she says.</p>
    <p>She was un­der scru­tiny by those who won­dered if this rel­a­tive un­known, who beat other more ex­pe­ri­enced and well-known ac­tresses for the part, could rise to the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>With the help of the pro­duc­tion team, she learnt that the pres­sure she felt ex­isted mostly in her head.</p>
    <p>“I had set stan­dards for my­self now that I had landed the role. The se­ries is based on a best-sell­ing book and my best friend is a big fan of the novel. I kept in mind that read­ers ev­ery­where would have ex­pec­ta­tions,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I learnt I had to let go of all those thoughts and just fo­cus on what I wanted to do with the char­ac­ter. I had to be­lieve in my­self.”</p>
    <p>A Suit­able Boy is avail­able on Net­flix.</p>
