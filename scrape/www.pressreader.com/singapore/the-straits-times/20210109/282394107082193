    <p>More than 20,000 busi­nesses took up some $17.4 bil­lion in loans through schemes over­seen by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) from March to De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>This amount was more than 13 times the credit ex­tended un­der ESG-sup­ported loans for the whole of 2019.</p>
    <p>The schemes, in­clud­ing the Tem­po­rary Bridg­ing Loan Pro­gramme, were in­tro­duced or en­hanced to tackle chal­lenges posed by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, such as cash flow con­straints.</p>
    <p>The whole­sale trade sec­tor, a key pil­lar of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy that ac­counts for 12 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, is one of the top ben­e­fi­cia­ries of these loan schemes, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Whole­sale trade com­pa­nies ac­counted for about one-fifth of ap­proved loans, while the hard-hit con­struc­tion sec­tor re­ceived 16 per cent of the to­tal loan amount dis­bursed un­der the schemes. Other in­dus­tries which ben­e­fited in­clude the man­u­fac­tur­ing, re­tail and ser­vice sec­tors.</p>
    <p>While the Covid-19 pan­demic has neg­a­tively af­fected the whole­sale trade sec­tor in the short term, Sin­ga­pore re­mains op­ti­mistic about the sec­tor’s long-term prospects, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>“We are cau­tiously op­ti­mistic that in 2021, we’ll see a re­bound for most of the com­modi­ties traded within the over­all sec­tor,” he said.</p>
    <p>The whole­sale trade sec­tor con</p>
    <p>trib­utes more than 320,000 jobs, ac­count­ing for 9 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s work­force. It com­prises more than 50,000 firms.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor in­cludes firms that im­port and ex­port food and bev­er­ages, and those in elec­tron­ics and ma­chin­ery, said Mr Chan. He was speak­ing</p>
    <p>to the me­dia af­ter a visit to whole­sale trade firm PS En­ergy, which dis­trib­utes fu­els and lu­bri­cants.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan high­lighted three fac­tors that will shape the whole­sale trade sec­tor in the com­ing years: the shift in sup­ply chains and trade flows; the in­creas­ing use of dig­i­tal</p>
    <p>tech­nol­ogy in con­ven­tional ar­bi­trage and to pro­vide greater trans­parency; and the search for greater re­silience, re­li­a­bil­ity and ef­fi­ciency in op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing of the last fac­tor, Mr Chan said it presents op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cal com­pa­nies “be­cause</p>
    <p>in Sin­ga­pore, we have built our­selves a rep­u­ta­tion of be­ing ef­fi­cient, re­li­able, de­pend­able”.</p>
    <p>“So this is an added ser­vice that we can pro­vide for the rest of the world,” he said.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to pro­vid­ing ac­cess to credit, the Gov­ern­ment has also helped firms in the sec­tor build up new ca­pa­bil­i­ties, such as through the adop­tion of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>This is a strat­egy to help firms cap­ture new mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties, and will help to strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion in the re­gional and global whole­sale trade mar­ket, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>He cited PS En­ergy as one of the firms ac­tively in­vest­ing in dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ini­tia­tives to op­ti­mise pro­cesses and raise pro­duc­tiv­ity. The firm has used new tech­nol­ogy to strengthen the trace­abil­ity and trans­parency of its pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Said the min­is­ter: “We are qui­etly op­ti­mistic that the whole­sale trade sec­tor will con­tinue to grow in Sin­ga­pore. We will di­ver­sify into many other new prod­ucts within whole­sale trade.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, it will cre­ate many more good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans in this par­tic­u­lar sec­tor.”</p>
