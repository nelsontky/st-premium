    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity should con­sider length­en­ing the ve­hi­cle in­spec­tion time­frame of pri­vate cars and mo­tor­cy­cles.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, ve­hi­cles need to un­dergo in­spec­tion to make sure they are road­wor­thy. For pri­vate cars, the first of these in­spec­tions is re­quired af­ter three years.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quently, it is to be car­ried out every two years un­til the 10th year, af­ter which in­spec­tion is re­quired every year.</p>
    <p>For mo­tor­cy­cles and scoot­ers, in­spec­tion is re­quired an­nu­ally af­ter the third year.</p>
    <p>Un­like other coun­tries with badly maintained roads, Sin­ga­pore’s roads are smooth, well-maintained and free of pot­holes.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s roads were ranked first for road qual­ity in­fra­struc­ture in the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s Global Com­pet­i­tive­ness re­port last year.</p>
    <p>Many car deal­ers now of­fer a five-year or even seven-year war­ranty mainly due to new tech­nolo­gies which al­low for stur­dier cars that stay road­wor­thy for longer.</p>
    <p>Clearly, there is lit­tle need for a car in­spec­tion in the ve­hi­cle’s first five years.</p>
    <p>I hope the LTA could con­sider re­quir­ing cars and mo­tor­cy­cles to be in­spected only every three years af­ter they are five-years-old.</p>
    <p>For ve­hi­cles above 10 years, bi­en­nial in­spec­tion in­stead of an­nual in­spec­tion could be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>En­cour­age or even man­date ve­hi­cle own­ers to change their car’s tyres af­ter every 10,000km to 15,000km of dis­tance trav­elled. This would pro­vide some safety as­sur­ance to all mo­torists on the road as well as en­sure well-maintained roads.</p>
    <p>Also en­cour­age mo­torists to be re­spon­si­ble for the road­wor­thi­ness of their ve­hi­cles. That would re­duce main­te­nance costs and ac­ci­dents. Foo Sing Kheng</p>
