    <p>A Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) un­der­grad­u­ate has ad­mit­ted to tak­ing voyeuris­tic videos, in­clud­ing those of women show­er­ing on cam­pus last year.</p>
    <p>Joel Ra­sis Is­mail, 27, had done so de­spite know­ing of the up­roar caused by a sim­i­lar in­ci­dent in 2018, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor An­dre Ong told the court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>That in­ci­dent in­volved Ms Mon­ica Baey, who was filmed show­er­ing by a fel­low NUS stu­dent.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Joel pleaded guilty to three charges of in­sult­ing a wo­man’s modesty and one of crim­i­nal tres­pass.</p>
    <p>Seven other sim­i­lar charges will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing on Sept 28 by Dis­trict Judge Adam Nakhoda.</p>
    <p>The vic­tims can­not be iden­ti­fied be­cause of a gag or­der.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that the NUS un­der­grad­u­ate was stay­ing at stu­dent dor­mi­tory Raf­fles Hall when he com­mit­ted the of­fences.</p>
    <p>On two oc­ca­sions in March last year, Joel went to the third level of the Kuok Foun­da­tion House – which is part of Raf­fles Hall – to visit a friend.</p>
    <p>He went there de­spite know­ing that it was a “fe­males-only” floor barred to males, said the pros­e­cu­tor.</p>
    <p>Both times, he went to a toi­let on the same level to re­lieve him­self, and he heard a wo­man en­ter an ad­ja­cent cu­bi­cle each time.</p>
    <p>On one oc­ca­sion, he placed his mo­bile phone in the gap be­tween the cu­bi­cle par­ti­tion and toi­let floor, and recorded the wo­man show­er­ing, court doc­u­ments stated.</p>
    <p>Two months later, Joel struck again. He went to the fe­male toi­let on the sixth level – also zoned as a “fe­males-only” floor – of the same build­ing to film a school­mate show­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The court heard that when he found the video record­ing to be “un­suc­cess­ful”, he took another video of the wo­man but was caught by her.</p>
    <p>He then fled to the third level to col­lect his laun­dry and change his clothes be­fore run­ning back to his res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>The po­lice ar­rested him a few hours later, af­ter re­view­ing closed­cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage.</p>
    <p>He later ad­mit­ted to his of­fences. Mr Ong said that Joel had com­mit­ted the of­fences while know­ing of the pub­lic dis­quiet caused by a sim­i­lar in­ci­dent in another res­i­dence hall in 2018.</p>
    <p>That in­ci­dent, which in­volved Ms Baey, led NUS to tighten se­cu­rity on its cam­pus and re­view its dis­ci­plinary and sup­port frame­works.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments also state that Joel had recorded two up­skirt videos of a col­league at work dur­ing an in­tern­ship in 2016.</p>
    <p>His lawyer Mal­colm Tan said he would ap­ply to the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health for a re­port on the like­li­hood of his client re­of­fend­ing.</p>
    <p>For each count of in­sult­ing a wo­man’s modesty, Joel could be jailed for up to a year and fined.</p>
    <p>He could also be jailed for up to three months and/or fined up to $500 for crim­i­nal tres­pass.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, NUS said Joel is cur­rently un­der a three­semester sus­pen­sion and is not al­lowed on cam­pus.</p>
    <p>“NUS has en­hanced the dis­ci­plinary frame­work for sex­ual mis­con­duct of­fences since June 2019, in­clud­ing sus­pen­sion and ex­pul­sion, as well as safety and se­cu­rity mea­sures,” it said.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity said that it is pro­vid­ing greater sup­port for vic­tims of such of­fences. It has also in­tro­duced train­ing for all staff and stu­dents to build a cul­ture of re­spect.</p>
