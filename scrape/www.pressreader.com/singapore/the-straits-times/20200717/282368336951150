    <p>LON­DON • Jose Mour­inho branded Harry Kane’s com­mit­ment to Tot­ten­ham “in­cred­i­ble” af­ter the striker put his body on the line to score his 200th and 201st club goals in a 3-1 Pre­mier League win at New­cas­tle on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The Spurs boss, who recorded his first win at St James’ Park in eight at­tempts, praised the con­tri­bu­tions of the striker, who has played al­most ev­ery minute of their last four games in the past 13 days.</p>
    <p>“Harry Kane knows how im­por­tant he is, he is in­cred­i­ble,” said Mour­inho. “Af­ter such a dif­fi­cult recovery, he is play­ing ev­ery minute of ev­ery game. This is the fourth game with two days in be­tween. We are the only team to have this, and Harry gave ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>Kane would have likely missed the rest of the sea­son through in­jury had it not been for the three­month coro­n­avirus-en­forced break, but his re­turn has given Spurs a shot at Europe next term.</p>
    <p>All but 16 of his 201 club goals have come for Spurs af­ter loan spells at Ley­ton Ori­ent, Mill­wall and Leicester early in his ca­reer. He said of his tally, which took place in 350 league games: “That’s not bad.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice to get to that mile­stone, but the points are the most im­por­tant thing. Hope­fully I’ll get a cou­ple more be­fore the sea­son ends.”</p>
    <p>Spurs re­main just out­side the Europa League qual­i­fy­ing spots with two Pre­mier League games left.</p>
    <p>If Arse­nal win the FA Cup, then a sixth-placed fin­ish se­cures a place. If Chelsea, Manch­ester City or Manch­ester United lift the Cup, sev­enth will be enough.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with Spurs play­ing top­four hope­fuls Leicester on Sun­day, Mour­inho re­mains hope­ful they can take ad­van­tage of any slip-ups by fel­low con­tenders Wolves, who drew 1-1 with Burn­ley on Wed­nes­day, or Sh­effield United.</p>
    <p>“We had re­silience and a great de­sire to win the match and to fight un­til the last for our ob­jec­tive, which is the Europa League,” he said. “If we can’t get to the Cham­pi­ons League, the Europa League is im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese coach hailed Serge Aurier’s “strong char­ac­ter” af­ter the Ivo­rian de­fender put aside his grief, to start the game just two days af­ter his brother, Christo­pher, was shot dead in Toulouse, France.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho also paid trib­ute to his men­tor, Bobby Rob­son, whose statue stands out­side St James’ Park. He was the late New­cas­tle and Eng­land man­ager’s as­sis­tant when the English­man was coach­ing Barcelona in the mid-1990s, be­fore mak­ing his name at Porto.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nally, I can leave the sta­dium and pass Mr Rob­son’s statue and laugh with him,” he said. “Be­cause ev­ery time I come here, I leave the sta­dium and I look at him with a sad face. It’s the first time I can leave the sta­dium and smile.”</p>
