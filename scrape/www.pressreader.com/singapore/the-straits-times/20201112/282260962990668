    <p>The pace of con­struc­tion ac­tiv­ity is slowly pick­ing up here, but it is far from busi­ness as usual.</p>
    <p>Firms con­tinue to grap­ple with new Covid-19 in­fec­tions and labour chal­lenges as well as strains on costs, cash flow and prof­its.</p>
    <p>The knock-on ef­fect has been a three- to six-month de­lay in con­struc­tion time­lines.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor is ex­pected to con­tract 23 per cent this year from last year, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial fore­casts in Septem­ber, down from the June es­ti­mate of an</p>
    <p>11.4 per cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has pumped in sig­nif­i­cant fi­nan­cial sup­port.</p>
    <p>Around 1,500 con­struc­tion firms have tapped th­ese re­lief mea­sures but th­ese are tem­po­rary, so com­pa­nies need to re­view and re­vise busi­ness mod­els to be sus­tain­able in the long term.</p>
    <p>RAMP UP USE OF TECH­NOL­OGY</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are look­ing to tech­nol­ogy to help com­ply with safe dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Three in five small busi­nesses here, in­clud­ing those in con­struc­tion, plan to in­vest in such tech­nol­ogy, noted a study by United Over­seas Bank (UOB), Dun & Brad­street and Ac­cen­ture.</p>
    <p>One ini­tia­tive is the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity’s (BCA) In­te­grated Dig­i­tal De­liv­ery (IDD) im­ple­men­ta­tion plan.</p>
    <p>Tiong Aik Con­struc­tion, a long­stand­ing UOB client, has used IDD to in­te­grate and over­see its</p>
    <p>en­tire project de­liv­ery process dig­i­tally – from de­sign to off-site fab­ri­ca­tion, on-site assem­bly, op­er­a­tions and build­ing main­te­nance sched­ules.</p>
    <p>This has en­abled project teams to work from dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions as they can ex­change in­for­ma­tion on the same se­cure dig­i­tal plat­form. It has re­duced the amount of man­power at work­sites and en­sured that safe dis­tanc­ing rules are met.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tiv­ity has also im­proved as a re­sult of go­ing dig­i­tal, with</p>
    <p>more em­ploy­ees now able to do other higher-value work rather than man­ual, mun­dane tasks.</p>
    <p>STRENGTHEN SUP­PLY CHAINS</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also cast a spot­light on the re­silience of sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Many con­struc­tion firms found their sup­ply chains dis­rupted as a re­sult of China’s lock­down mea­sures ear­lier in the year. Th­ese dis­rup­tions, cou­pled with price volatil­ity, have made it dif­fi­cult for com­pa­nies to man­age projects.</p>
    <p>While prices have started to sta­bilise af­ter China eased its lock­down, un­cer­tainty re­mains over the pos­si­bil­ity of new waves of Covid-19 in­fec­tions glob­ally and the im­pact on sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>As such, com­pa­nies need to plan for the pos­si­bil­ity of fu­ture dis­rup­tions and look be­yond their usual sup­pli­ers to en­hance sup­ply chain re­silience.</p>
    <p>Smaller con­struc­tion firms, in par­tic­u­lar, must tackle this prob­lem with greater ur­gency as they are more sus­cep­ti­ble to dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>One way to achieve this is by tap­ping the sup­port of part­ners – in­clud­ing banks, gov­ern­ment bod­ies and in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tions – to forge new part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>Th­ese or­gan­i­sa­tions can also help firms un­der­stand lo­cal reg­u­la­tions and busi­ness prac­tices, as well as iron out po­ten­tial is­sues up­front.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, with the help of their bank­ing part­ner, con­struc­tion com­pa­nies can bet­ter over­come con­cerns such as the lack of trust when deal­ing with a new sup­plier.</p>
    <p>One way is through trade</p>
    <p>fi­nanc­ing so­lu­tions that en­able the buyer to make pay­ment only upon the re­ceipt of goods.</p>
    <p>UOB has also stepped up its sup­port for con­struc­tion com­pa­nies by pro­vid­ing value chain fi­nanc­ing. By con­nect­ing var­i­ous par­ties in­volved in a project – from con­trac­tors to project man­agers – the bank cre­ates an ecosys­tem where it can draw in­sights on the col­lab­o­ra­tion and track record of par­tic­i­pants to as­sess each firm’s fi­nanc­ing needs and el­i­gi­bil­ity holis­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>Value chain fi­nanc­ing can be used to ex­tend credit to those who may have been in­el­i­gi­ble for bank loans pre­vi­ously, thereby al­low­ing more play­ers to com­plete projects in a timely man­ner.</p>
    <p>UOB recorded a twofold in­crease in the num­ber of con­struc­tion firms se­cur­ing loans un­der value chain fi­nanc­ing in the first six months of the year com­pared with the end of last year.</p>
    <p>DE­VELOP EX­PER­TISE IN SUS­TAIN­ABIL­ITY</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the pan­demic on the broader econ­omy will also likely af­fect the fu­ture of build­ing and con­struc­tion as health­care and man­u­fac­tur­ing projects are ex­pected to in­crease in the near term.</p>
    <p>De­mand for tourism, hos­pi­tal­ity, re­tail and entertainm­ent-re­lated projects will con­tinue to stall. The Gov­ern­ment an­nounced, for ex­am­ple, that build­ing the fifth ter­mi­nal at Changi Air­port will be paused for at least two years, given the un­cer­tain­ties in the tourism in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>An area where de­mand is ex­pected to re­main strong is in the con­struc­tion of green build­ings. For ex­am­ple, the BCA is re­view­ing rules on air-con­di­tion­ing and me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion based on lessons learnt from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Green Build­ing Coun­cil noted that tra­di­tional air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tems in most com­mer­cial build­ings cir­cu­late up to 90 per cent of in­door air, which keeps pathogens within the premises for a long time.</p>
    <p>It is now likely that more build­ings, whether newly de­signed or up­graded, will in­cor­po­rate green fea­tures, which help re­duce the trans­mis­sion of viruses and have lower car­bon foot­prints.</p>
    <p>This is in line with the BCA’s tar­get of hav­ing at least 80 per cent of build­ings cer­ti­fied with its</p>
    <p>Green Mark by 2030.</p>
    <p>It also launched the Su­per Low En­ergy (SLE) Build­ing Pro­gramme in 2018 to en­cour­age firms to ex­ceed ex­ist­ing Green Mark Plat­inum stan­dards and to drive in­no­va­tions in de­sign and ma­te­rial sci­ence.</p>
    <p>The SLE Pro­gramme en­cour­ages com­pa­nies to de­velop build­ings with best-in-class tech­nolo­gies to achieve a min­i­mum of 60 per cent en­ergy ef­fi­ciency im­prove­ment over 2005 lev­els.</p>
    <p>Given the com­mit­ment to en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity from the Gov­ern­ment and the in­dus­try, it will be es­sen­tial for con­struc­tion firms to build up their sus­tain­abil­ity of­fer­ings to cap­ture growth op­por­tu­ni­ties in this area.</p>
    <p>While it is dif­fi­cult to pre­dict how the world will op­er­ate when Covid-19 is de­feated, the trends of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity in con­struc­tion will re­main as the new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Those that can adapt their busi­ness mod­els stand the best chance for a stronger fu­ture.</p>
