    <p>Cal­i­for­nia Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris has of­fi­cially ac­cepted the Demo­cratic Party’s nom­i­na­tion to run as its vice-pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, mak­ing his­tory as the first black and South Asian woman on a ma­jor party’s pres­i­den­tial ticket.</p>
    <p>The third night of the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion (DNC) on Wed­nes­day fea­tured Demo­cratic heavy­weights in­clud­ing past pres­i­dent Barack Obama, who gave an un­usu­ally heavy-hit­ting cri­tique of his suc­ces­sor and his ad­min­is­tra­tion as a threat to Amer­ica’s democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama and for­mer Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Hil­lary Clin­ton also reached out to un­de­cided vot­ers in their speeches, urg­ing them not to sit out the elec­tion and warn­ing that the con­se­quences of Mr Don­ald Trump win­ning a sec­ond term were too dire.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Obama, whose voice wa­vered with emo­tion at times: “Don­ald Trump hasn’t grown into the job be­cause he can’t. And the con­se­quences of that fail­ure are se­vere – 170,000 Amer­i­cans dead. Mil­lions of jobs gone, while those at the top take in more than ever.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing from the Mu­seum of the Amer­i­can Revo­lu­tion in Philadel­phia, he warned that Amer­ica’s demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions were be­ing threat­ened like never be­fore, and the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had “shown it will tear our democ­racy down if that’s what it takes to win”.</p>
    <p>“What we do these next 76 days will echo through gen­er­a­tions to come,” he said, as he called on Amer­i­cans to rally be­hind pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den and Ms Har­ris, as well as Democrats in fed­eral and state races, and vote Mr Trump out.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­sponded twice on Twit­ter as Mr Obama’s speech was on­go­ing. “HE SPIED ON MY CAM­PAIGN, AND GOT CAUGHT!” he said, re­fer­ring to the Spy­gate con­spir­acy the­ory that the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion had spied on his cam­paign in 2016, which the Jus­tice Depart­ment found no ev­i­dence of in a re­port last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mrs Clin­ton, who l ost to Mr Trump in 2016 by ra­zor-thin mar­gins in cru­cial bat­tle­ground states de­spite win­ning the pop­u­lar vote, made a sim­i­lar plea to Amer­i­cans to turn out to vote in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“For four years, peo­ple have said to me, ‘I didn’t re­alise how dan­ger­ous he was’, ‘I wish I could go back</p>
    <p>DO THE IM­POR­TANT WORK</p>
    <p>We must elect a pres­i­dent who will bring some­thing dif­fer­ent, some­thing bet­ter, and do the im­por­tant work. A pres­i­dent who will bring all of us to­gether – black, white, Latino, Asian, Indige­nous – to achieve the fu­ture we col­lec­tively ’’ want.</p>
    <p>CALIFORNIA­N SEN­A­TOR KA­MALA HAR­RIS RE­CALL­ING HER WORDS</p>
    <p>But didn’t she call him a racist??? Didn’t she say he ’’ was in­com­pe­tent???</p>
    <p>U.S. PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP, in a tweet about Ms Har­ris’ pre­vi­ous at­tack on Mr Joe Bi­den over his record on race is­sues, while they were both ri­vals for the Demo­cratic White House nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>ECHO THROUGH GEN­ER­A­TIONS</p>
    <p>Don­ald Trump hasn’t grown into the job be­cause he can’t ... What we do these next 76 days will echo through gen­er­a­tions ’’ to come.</p>
    <p>FOR­MER U.S. PRES­I­DENT BARACK OBAMA DE­LAYED SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>Why did he refuse to en­dorse Slow Joe un­til it was all over, and even then ’’ was very late?</p>
    <p>MR TRUMP, in a tweet dur­ing Mr Barack Obama’s speech, ques­tion­ing Mr Obama’s sup­port for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>and do it over’, ‘I should have voted’. This can’t be an­other woul­da­coulda-shoulda elec­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>Un­like the pre­vi­ous two nights of the vir­tual DNC which fo­cused on Mr Bi­den’s char­ac­ter and per­son­al­ity, Wed­nes­day’s pro­gramme was heav­ier on pol­icy. Law­mak­ers and ac­tivists high­lighted Mr Bi­den’s stances on is­sues close to Demo­cratic vot­ers, in­clud­ing gun con­trol, im­mi­gra­tion rights, cli­mate change ac­tion and af­ford­able child­care.</p>
    <p>The night’s line-up also paid trib­ute to women in pol­i­tics, fea­tur­ing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen­a­tor El­iz­a­beth War­ren, while high­light­ing the sig­nif­i­cance of Ms Har­ris’ nom­i­na­tion, which comes 100 years after women in the US won the right to vote.</p>
    <p>Her speech was viewed by ob­servers as a chance for her to in­tro­duce her­self to the wider pub­lic and high­light her qual­i­fi­ca­tions and strengths as a can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, 55, re­flected on her per­sonal his­tory and paid trib­ute to the gen­er­a­tions of women on whose shoul­ders she stood, par­tic­u­larly her mother Shya­mala Gopalan, a breast can­cer re­searcher who died in 2009.</p>
    <p>She came to Amer­ica from In­dia at age 19 to pur­sue her dream of cur­ing can­cer, pur­su­ing and earn­ing a PhD at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia Berke­ley. It was there that she met Mr Don­ald Har­ris, who had come from Ja­maica to study eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris’ par­ents split when she was five, and she and her younger sis­ter Maya were raised mostly by their mother.</p>
    <p>“I keep think­ing about that 25-year-old In­dian woman – all of five feet tall (1.52m) – who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hos­pi­tal in Oak­land, Cal­i­for­nia. On that day, she prob­a­bly could have never imag­ined that I would be stand­ing be­fore you now speak­ing these words: I ac­cept your nom­i­na­tion for vice-pres­i­dent of the United States of Amer­ica.”</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, who has high­lighted her rise from col­lege grad­u­ate to pros­e­cu­tor, Cal­i­for­nia’s at­tor­ney­gen­eral, sen­a­tor and now vice-pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee as an em­bod­i­ment of the Amer­i­can dream, said her val­ues had been shaped by her mother.</p>
    <p>“She taught us to be con­scious and com­pas­sion­ate about the strug­gles of all peo­ple. To be­lieve pub­lic ser­vice is a no­ble cause and the fight for jus­tice is a shared re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Mak­ing the case for Mr Bi­den and her­self as the next lead­ers of Amer­ica, Ms Har­ris said: “We must elect a pres­i­dent who will bring some­thing dif­fer­ent, some­thing bet­ter, and do the im­por­tant work. A pres­i­dent who will bring all of us to­gether – black, white, Latino, Asian, Indige­nous – to achieve the fu­ture we col­lec­tively want.”</p>
    <p>But their vi­sion felt dis­tant in to­day’s Amer­ica, rav­aged by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, she said, blam­ing Mr Trump’s “fail­ure of lead­er­ship” for the loss of lives and liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, 22 years younger than Mr Bi­den, 77, also sought in her speech to be a bridge be­tween older mod­er­ates and younger pro­gres­sive vot­ers, whose voices and causes of racial jus­tice, gun con­trol, im­mi­gra­tion rights and cli­mate change ac­tion fea­tured heav­ily on the night.</p>
    <p>“You are push­ing us to re­alise the ideals of our na­tion, push­ing us to live the val­ues we share: de­cency and fair­ness, jus­tice and love. In this elec­tion, we have a chance to change the course of his­tory,” she said.</p>
