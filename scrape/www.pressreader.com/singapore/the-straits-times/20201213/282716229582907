    <p>For­mer marine bi­ol­o­gist Elaine Zhao was about four years into her first job when she de­cided to switch ca­reers, choos­ing a field which she felt had more op­por­tu­ni­ties for growth – data science.</p>
    <p>Her in­ter­est had been piqued while work­ing on a project with data sci­en­tists at an en­vi­ron­men­tal con­sult­ing firm she was with.</p>
    <p>“It was my first ex­po­sure to work­ing with data and made me re­alise what my col­leagues could do with data and that I ac­tu­ally like work­ing with it,” said Ms Zhao, 28.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­plet­ing on­line cour­ses while em­ployed, she at­tended a full-time data science boot camp at train­ing provider Gen­eral As­sem­bly from Septem­ber to De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>She started work in Jan­uary as an as­so­ci­ate data sci­en­tist in food tech­nol­ogy start-up Hoow Foods where she looks at food-re­lated data, such as calo­ries, to see how food can be made health­ier with­out af­fect­ing the tex­ture or taste.</p>
    <p>Her job also in­volves de­vel­op­ing ma­chine-learn­ing al­go­rithms and con­duct­ing lab­o­ra­tory ex­per­i­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Zhao said she is en­joy­ing her new job, es­pe­cially as it aligns with her in­ter­ests in cook­ing and food science.</p>
    <p>Be­fore land­ing the role, she con­sid­ered tak­ing up a masters pro­gramme but de­cided the boot camp made more sense in terms of money and time.</p>
    <p>The three-month course cost about $5,500 af­ter gov­ern­ment fund­ing from the Tech Im­mer­sion and Place­ment Pro­gramme. Ms Zhao also paid about $200 for a course called AI for In­dus­try be­fore the boot camp.</p>
    <p>She picked up tech­ni­cal skills in the boot camp and soft skills such as how to have a growth mind­set.</p>
    <p>“That’s very im­por­tant in the data science field be­cause things change re­ally quickly. New ma­chine learn­ing li­braries come up, new lan­guages, new ways of solv­ing cur­rent prob­lems,” she said.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral As­sem­bly also pro­vided a ca­reer coach fa­mil­iar with job switch­ers, who high­lighted rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence from her pre­vi­ous job she could in­clude in her cur­ricu­lum vi­tae (CV).</p>
    <p>She had no ma­jor fi­nan­cial com­mit­ments, which meant Ms Zhao could tap her sav­ings to reskill.</p>
    <p>“Once you’re sure that you want to go into a new field, don’t pro­cras­ti­nate. If you need to do a course, do it,” she said. “But don’t just jump in, do your re­search prop­erly to make sure it’s some­thing you re­ally want to do and can af­ford to do,” she added.</p>
    <p>She has no re­grets pur­su­ing her in­ter­est in bi­ol­ogy at univer­sity, even though she is now work­ing in a dif­fer­ent field. “It was only af­ter I made these life de­ci­sions – to study bi­ol­ogy and work at my pre­vi­ous com­pany – that I dis­cov­ered an in­ter­est in data science and ended up where I am to­day.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Ms Elaine Zhao feels that if you are keen to work in an&#xAD;other field, you have to walk the talk. &#x201C;Do your re&#xAD;search prop&#xAD;erly to make sure it&#x2019;s some&#xAD;thing you re&#xAD;ally want to do and can af&#xAD;ford to do,&#x201D; she says.</p>
