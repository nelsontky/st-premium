    <p>TOKYO • Yuki Tsun­oda is con­fi­dent his at­tack­ing driv­ing style will give Ja­panese fans plenty to cheer when he makes his For­mula One de­but for Al­phaTauri next sea­son.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old will be­come the first Ja­panese driver to com­pete in F1 since Ka­mui Kobayashi drove for the now-de­funct Cater­ham team in 2014.</p>
    <p>Italy-based Al­phaTauri last week an­nounced Tsun­oda will re­place Rus­sia’s Daniil Kvyat, mak­ing him the only Asian driver on the grid for next term af­ter Bri­tish-born Thai Alexan­der Al­bon was dropped by Red Bull in favour of Ser­gio Perez.</p>
    <p>Tsun­oda was named FIA Rookie of the Year on Satur­day af­ter fin­ish­ing third in his de­but sea­son with Car­lin in For­mula 2, and he wants to make a sim­i­lar im­pact when he steps up in class next year.</p>
    <p>“My strong point is my at­tack­ing style, and I’m con­fi­dent that peo­ple who see me driv­ing will be im­pressed by it,” Tsun­oda, who won three For­mula 2 races this year, with seven podium fin­ishes and four pole po­si­tions, told re­porters dur­ing an on­line press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“I’m a rookie, so for the first half of the sea­son, I want to dou­ble down on my at­tack­ing style and take it as far as I can, even if I make mis­takes.”</p>
    <p>Tsun­oda, who is backed by the ju­nior pro­gramme of Al­phaTauri’s en­gine sup­plier Honda, will race along­side France’s Pierre Gasly, who took his first F1 vic­tory at the Ital­ian Grand Prix in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“My team­mate has a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence and I want to ab­sorb as much as I can from him while also see­ing how far my po­ten­tial can take me,” he said. “Then, for the sec­ond half of the sea­son, I want to use ev­ery­thing I’ve learnt and try to im­prove with ev­ery race.”</p>
    <p>At 1.59m, Tsun­oda is a diminu­tive fig­ure, and he ad­mit­ted he will have to hit the gym over the win­ter to cope with Al­phaTauri’s su­pe­rior power and down­force com­pared to Car­lin. Re­call­ing his F1 test in Abu Dhabi, where he drove 123 laps ear­lier this month, he said: “In</p>
    <p>GO­ING ALL OUT</p>
    <p>F2, I didn’t re­ally no­tice my neck mov­ing for­ward when I braked but when I drove an F1 car and hit the brakes for the first time, I re­ally felt the G-force on my neck.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, if I didn’t rest my head against the head­rest, I couldn’t even lift it. I’m go­ing to have to strengthen my neck mus­cles in or­der to com­pete.”</p>
    <p>Tsun­oda, who said he was so ner­vous when sign­ing his Al­phaTauri con­tract that he could barely hold his pen, is look­ing for­ward to next year’s Ja­panese Grand Prix af­ter this year’s race was axed be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He also re­vealed he was in­spired watch­ing Lewis Hamil­ton of Mercedes race at Suzuka when he was seven or eight years old and would love to have a sim­i­lar im­pact on the next gen­er­a­tion of fans.</p>
    <p>“This year has been tough, but the Ja­panese GP will be at Suzuka next year and I’d love fans to come and see it for them­selves. My strong point is my over­tak­ing, and I’d love fans to come and watch me,” he said.</p>
    <p>My strong point is my at­tack­ing style, and I’m con­fi­dent that peo­ple who see me driv­ing will be im­pressed by it.</p>
