    <p>BEI­JING • Mr Mi­los Vys­tr­cil, Speaker of the Czech Se­nate, will “pay a heavy price” for mak­ing an of­fi­cial trip to Tai­wan, China’s State Coun­cil­lor Wang Yi said yes­ter­day, prompt­ing Prague to sum­mon China’s am­bas­sador to ex­plain com­ments that it said “crossed the line”.</p>
    <p>Mr Vys­tr­cil ar­rived in Taipei on Sun­day on a visit to pro­mote busi­ness links with Tai­wan, and said the Czech Repub­lic would not bow to Bei­jing’s ob­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>China con­sid­ers Tai­wan a break­away prov­ince in­el­i­gi­ble for stateto-state re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese govern­ment and Chi­nese peo­ple won’t take a lais­sez-faire at­ti­tude or sit idly by, and will make him (Vys­tr­cil) pay a heavy price for his short-sighted be­hav­iour and po­lit­i­cal op­por­tunism,” Mr Wang, who is also For­eign Min­is­ter, said on his min­istry’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang, who was vis­it­ing Ger­many, gave no fur­ther de­tails of how Bei­jing would re­spond.</p>
    <p>Czech For­eign Min­is­ter To­mas Pet­ricek said that although the govern­ment did not sup­port the trip, Mr Wang’s re­marks were too strong and he sum­moned the Chi­nese am­bas­sador to ex­plain.</p>
    <p>“Min­is­ter Wang’s state­ment has crossed the line, such strong words don’t be­long in re­la­tions be­tween two sov­er­eign coun­tries,” Mr Pet­ricek said on Twit­ter, call­ing for cooperatio­n “with­out emo­tions which don’t be­long in diplo­macy”.</p>
    <p>The Czech for­eign min­istry then posted on its web­site that Deputy Min­is­ter Martin Tlapa had sum­moned the am­bas­sador, ex­press­ing “fun­da­men­tal dis­ap­proval” of the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Vys­tr­cil said Mr Wang’s com­ments were an in­ter­fer­ence in Czech in­ter­nal af­fairs and that his visit to Tai­wan was not meant to “po­lit­i­cally con­front any­one”.</p>
    <p>“We are a free coun­try seek­ing to have good re­la­tion­ships with all coun­tries and I be­lieve this will be the case in the fu­ture, ir­re­spec­tive</p>
    <p>GOOD RE­LA­TIONS WITH ALL</p>
    <p>We are a free coun­try seek­ing to have good re­la­tion­ships with all coun­tries and I be­lieve this will be the case in the fu­ture, ir­re­spec­tive of the ’’ state­ment of the min­is­ter. CZECH SE­NATE SPEAKER MI­LOS VYS­TR­CIL , in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>of the state­ment of the min­is­ter,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing later at a Taipei univer­sity, Mr Vys­tr­cil praised Tai­wan and its demo­cratic way of life.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan Eco­nomics Min­is­ter Wang Mei-hua, speak­ing be­fore a busi­ness fo­rum with Mr Vys­tr­cil, told re­porters that the Czech Repub­lic and Tai­wan were both “free and demo­cratic coun­tries which put great store on hu­man rights”.</p>
    <p>Czech Pres­i­dent Mi­los Ze­man has sought closer busi­ness and po­lit­i­cal ties with China since tak­ing of­fice in 2013, but his ef­forts have been hit by failed in­vest­ment plans and Prague’s wa­ver­ing over al­low­ing China’s Huawei Tech­nolo­gies to play a role in de­vel­op­ing the</p>
    <p>Czech Repub­lic’s next-gen­er­a­tion tele­coms net­works.</p>
    <p>The Czech govern­ment ac­cepts the One China pol­icy un­der which Bei­jing con­sid­ers Tai­wan a part of its ter­ri­tory, with re­uni­fi­ca­tion by force an op­tion, and does not send of­fi­cial del­e­ga­tions to the is­land.</p>
    <p>But Mr Vys­tr­cil is a mem­ber of the right-wing op­po­si­tion Civic Democrats and is not bound by the pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>His 90-mem­ber group – in­clud­ing politi­cians, en­trepreneur­s, sci­en­tists and jour­nal­ists – will stay in Tai­wan un­til Fri­day. He gave a speech in Tai­wan’s Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day and is due to meet Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen. by Washington for an in­de­pen­dent in­quiry into the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which was first de­tected in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>Huawei said it will re­main in­volved with the club, with the com­pany logo re­lo­cated to the back of the Raiders jer­sey. It will also re­tain nam­ing rights of the Huawei Raiders Train­ing Cen­tre in Can­berra as “an im­por­tant show­case of our tech­nol­ogy”.</p>
    <p>Mr Mitchell said that af­ter the com­pany was barred from in­volve­ment in Aus­tralia’s 5G de­vel­op­ment, “we man­aged to find the re­sources to con­tinue the spon­sor­ship, but we just can’t fi­nan­cially sup­port it any longer”.</p>
    <p>Raiders chief Don Furner paid trib­ute to Huawei’s “un­wa­ver­ing” sup­port over the years, say­ing: “This re­la­tion­ship has been about so much more than just a logo on a jer­sey. We have worked with Huawei on a num­ber of very im­por­tant community ini­tia­tives and fundrais­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for very worth­while causes.”</p>
    <p>Huawei has be­come a piv­otal is­sue in the geopo­lit­i­cal stand-off be­tween Bei­jing and Washington, which claims the firm poses a sig­nif­i­cant cy­ber-se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>Washington has essen­tially barred it from the US market and waged a global cam­paign to iso­late the com­pany, which over­took Sam­sung to be­come the largest global smart­phone man­u­fac­turer in the past quar­ter.</p>
