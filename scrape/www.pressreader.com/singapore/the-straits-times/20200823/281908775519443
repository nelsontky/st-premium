    <p>The United States Postal Ser­vice (USPS) will be able to de­liver the na­tion’s mail-in bal­lots fully and on time, said Post­mas­ter Gen­eral Louis DeJoy on Fri­day, ac­knowl­edg­ing re­cent de­lays in mail de­liv­ery while de­fend­ing the cost-cut­ting changes made un­der his watch.</p>
    <p>Mr DeJoy was grilled at a Se­nate hear­ing, which had been called due to grow­ing con­cerns that the USPS would not be able to cope with the ex­pected surge in mail-in vot­ing due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The furore over the de­lays shows how politi­cised a com­monly ac­cepted method of vot­ing has be­come, and how much US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s at­tacks on vot­ing by mail have cre­ated an at­mos­phere of mis­trust over any or­gan­i­sa­tional changes.</p>
    <p>Democrats fear a de­lib­er­ate par­ti­san at­tempt by Mr DeJoy to sab­o­tage the de­liv­ery of bal­lots to help Mr Trump win the elec­tion, after the Pres­i­dent’s re­peated at­tacks on the le­git­i­macy of mail-in vot­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr DeJoy, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of a lo­gis­tics firm, has do­nated over US$1.2 mil­lion (S$1.65 mil­lion) to the Trump cam­paign and is the first post­mas­ter-gen­eral in decades to come from out­side the USPS. He was ap­pointed in June by a board of gov­er­nors with ties to Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Mr DeJoy called the sug­ges­tions that he was in­ter­fer­ing with bal­lot de­liv­ery “an out­ra­geous claim” and said he had only once spo­ken with Mr Trump in a con­grat­u­la­tory call when he was ap­pointed as post­mas­ter-gen­eral.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the hear­ing, Demo­crat and Repub­li­can sen­a­tors ex­pressed con­cern about wide­spread de­lays in mail de­liv­ery, which vul­ner­a­ble se­niors and vet­er­ans rely on to re­ceive their medicine and essen­tial cheques, par­tic­u­larly in ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Mr DeJoy said his re­forms were needed to keep the USPS fi­nan­cially afloat. “Man­ag­ing the postal ser­vice in an ef­fi­cient and ef­fec­tive man­ner can­not suc­ceed if ev­ery­thing is politi­cised,” he said.</p>
    <p>He said he sup­ported vot­ing by mail and thought the Amer­i­can pub­lic should be able to do so, in con­trast to Mr Trump’s re­peated dis­par­age­ment of the process.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­peat­edly claimed with­out proof that vot­ing by mail en­ables wide­spread elec­toral fraud and ben­e­fits Democrats, a move that has alarmed crit­ics who view it as an at­tempt to un­der­mine the le­git­i­macy of the re­sult should he lose.</p>
    <p>Hours after Mr DeJoy’s tes­ti­mony, Mr Trump told sup­port­ers at the meet­ing of the con­ser­va­tive Coun­cil for Na­tional Policy in Ar­ling­ton, Vir­ginia, that vot­ing by mail “could be one of the great­est catas­tro­phes in the history of our coun­try”.</p>
    <p>In fact, more Amer­i­cans are vot­ing by mail, although this varies widely by state. The share of vot­ers who vote by mail has risen from 7.8 per cent in 1996 to 20.9 per cent in 2016, ac­cord­ing to a Pew Re­search Cen­tre anal­y­sis. A Pew poll in April found that 70 per cent sup­ported al­low­ing any voter to vote by mail if they wanted to.</p>
    <p>Democrats, who fear that Repub­li­cans’ re­sis­tance to make it eas­ier to vote by mail is an at­tempt to sup­press vot­ers, point to Mr Trump’s past com­ments that he op­posed more fund­ing for the USPS to ham­per ef­forts to ex­pand mail-in vot­ing.</p>
