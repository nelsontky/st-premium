    <p>•</p>
    <p>Spain has be­come the fourth Western Euro­pean coun­try to pass two mil­lion cu­mu­la­tive Covid-19 cases, ac­cord­ing to health min­istry data on Thurs­day, while the rate of in­fec­tion con­tin­ues to climb.</p>
    <p>The mile­stone came as the health min­istry re­ported 42,360 cases since Tues­day, bring­ing the to­tal to 2,024,904.</p>
    <p>But sero­preva­lence stud­ies that test peo­ple us­ing a blood serum sam­ple sug­gest the fig­ure is far higher.</p>
    <p>“The to­tal num­ber of con­firmed cases... al­ready ex­ceeds two mil­lion to­day,” said Ms Maria Jose Serra, deputy head of the health min­istry’s emer­gen­cies unit.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, we are see­ing a new in­crease of cases, they had de­creased and now they are in­creas­ing again in what we could call the third wave.”</p>
    <p>Over the same 48-hour pe­riod,</p>
    <p>Spain also reg­is­tered an­other 245 deaths, rais­ing the over­all toll to 51,675.</p>
    <p>Af­ter dip­ping be­low 200 cases per 100,000 peo­ple in early De­cem­ber, the coro­n­avirus’ in­ci­dence in­creased steadily to reach 321 cases per 100,000, fig­ures on Thurs­day showed.</p>
    <p>Ms Jose Serra said Spain had iden­ti­fied “around 60 con­firmed cases” of the highly con­ta­gious coro­n­avirus vari­ant that is sweep­ing Bri­tain, but added it was not a key driver in the re­cent surge.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the au­thor­i­ties in the north­ern re­gion of Castile and Leon have an­nounced that they would close shop­ping cen­tres and gyms, and ex­tended a ban on nonessen­tial travel across re­gional bor­ders un­til May.</p>
    <p>The move fol­lows a sim­i­lar tight­en­ing in north-eastern Cat­alo­nia, where all ci­ti­zens have been con</p>
    <p>fined to their home mu­nic­i­pal­ity for 10 days ex­cept for ur­gent trips.</p>
    <p>On Oct 21, Spain be­came the first Euro­pean coun­try to record a mil­lion coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, with Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez ad­mit­ting just days later that the real num­ber was three times higher.</p>
    <p>Al­though the num­bers have shot up, prompt­ing most of Spain’s 17 re­gions to im­pose new curbs on public life, the gov­ern­ment has re­mained adamant that it will not im­pose a new lock­down, and mea­sures across most of Spain re­main less strin­gent than else­where in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Since the lock­down ended in June, the var­i­ous re­gions have taken re­spon­si­bil­ity for man­ag­ing the pan­demic, with the state of emer­gency grant­ing them the le­gal rights to en­force a cur­few and other re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>But it does not give them the power to im­pose a re­gional lock­down – which can be done only by the cen­tral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Spain has vac­ci­nated 207,323 peo­ple so far, up by nearly 68,000 since Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts see mass vac­ci­na­tions as the best route back to nor­mal­ity, but the first roll-outs have co­in­cided with alarm­ing spikes in deaths and caseloads across many parts of the world.</p>
