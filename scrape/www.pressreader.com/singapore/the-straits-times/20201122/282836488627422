    <p>1 I’m still young, I don’t need in­sur­ance</p>
    <p>Ill­ness and calamity can hit peo­ple of all ages and it is pru­dent to take up in­sur­ance the mo­ment you start work­ing. Not only will it be cheaper, you will also avoid prob­lems of not be­ing in­sur­able if you sud­denly develop a health con­di­tion that ex­cludes you from fu­ture cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>2 I don’t need more than one pol­icy</p>
    <p>Your first pol­icy is likely to pro­vide much lower cov­er­age be­cause you prob­a­bly did not want to spend too much on the pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>But as your earn­ing power in­creases and when you start a fam­ily, you are likely to want to in­crease your cov­er­age so that you can pro­vide a safety net for your loved ones in case some­thing hap­pens to you.</p>
    <p>Also, needs will change. Term in­sur­ance, while much cheaper and pro­vid­ing ad­e­quate cov­er­age, is an out­right ex­pense that does not pro­vide any ben­e­fits if no claims are filed.</p>
    <p>So, many peo­ple still pre­fer “bun­dled deals” such as whole life and in­vest­ment-linked poli­cies, which usu­ally hold some value at old age.</p>
    <p>Do­ing so gives many cus­tomers the com­fort of know­ing that their pre­mi­ums are not go­ing to waste, es­pe­cially when no claims are filed.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing more than one pol­icy also gives you the op­tion to end some poli­cies later in life so that you can re­duce your pre­mium pay­ments dur­ing re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>3 In­sur­ance is ex­pen­sive</p>
    <p>When it comes to in­sur­ance, ev­ery­thing has a fixed value ex­cept hu­man life, which is deemed price­less.</p>
    <p>Tech­ni­cally there is noth­ing stop­ping you from in­sur­ing your life for hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars so long as you are pre­pared to pay the pre­mi­ums, which are likely to be in the mil­lions as well.</p>
    <p>But if you are more grounded in your ex­pec­ta­tions, most poli­cies are quite af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the pre­mium to get $100,000 of cov­er­age for a crit­i­cal ill­ness such as cancer costs over $400 a year.</p>
    <p>Of course, if you in­crease the cov­er­age to $500,000 and bun­dle your poli­cies with a whole life and with some in­vest­ment el­e­ments, the sum can run close to $10,000 a year.</p>
    <p>So it is best to pay for cov­er­age that suits your needs.</p>
    <p>4 Only older folk buy in­sur­ance</p>
    <p>Con­trary to this per­cep­tion, mil­len­ni­als are more savvy and tend to read up ex­ten­sively on­line be­fore mak­ing any pur­chases. In­deed, many young peo­ple are aware that med­i­cal in­sur­ance is im­por­tant and they en­cour­age their par­ents to buy such poli­cies.</p>
    <p>But some younger folk are turned off by life in­sur­ance be­cause they see it as “death poli­cies”. Since they are young, many are not keen to have such plans be­cause they feel they are un­likely to die soon.</p>
    <p>Even if they do sign up, most would opt for term poli­cies and not whole life plans, which are pre­ferred by their par­ents.</p>
    <p>While many older folk are fa­mil­iar with tra­di­tional life poli­cies, some do not want ad­di­tional hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion plans. They feel there is no need to have ex­tra cov­er­age since they are al­ready cov­ered un­der the com­pul­sory MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>Some may come around to see­ing the ben­e­fits of ad­di­tional hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion in­sur­ance when they see their chil­dren’s own plans pay­ing for all hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion costs.</p>
