    <p>KEEP­ING VIR­TUAL SPA­CES SAFE Our com­mu­nity part­ner­ships must go be­yond the phys­i­cal sphere, in­volv­ing busi­ness part­ners and en­ti­ties on­line, to strengthen the ecosys­tem for a more ef­fec­tive and co­or­di­nated re­sponse to these threats. MIN­IS­TER OF STATE FOR HOME AF­FAIRS DES­MOND TAN, on stay­ing ahead of crim­i­nals on­line.</p>
    <p>The fight against ter­ror­ism in Sin­ga­pore re­ceived a boost yes­ter­day with the launch of a new group that will share rel­e­vant and timely counter-ter­ror data be­tween tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies and the po­lice.</p>
    <p>The On­line In­dus­try Safety and Se­cu­rity Watch Group (On­line iSSWG), a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force and Asia In­ter­net Coali­tion (AIC), will also pro­mote greater ex­change of in­for­ma­tion to fight on­line crime and en­hance pub­lic aware­ness of scams.</p>
    <p>The coali­tion in­cludes big names in the tech world like Face­book, Google and Grab.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the watch group’s launch, Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan said ter­ror­ism has ex­panded its in­flu­ence via on­line chan­nels, with se­ri­ous con­se­quences in the real world.</p>
    <p>He cited the at­tacker who killed more than 50 peo­ple in the 2019 shoot­ings in Christchur­ch, New Zealand, who had formed his views from the In­ter­net and was em­bold­ened by oth­ers he met in ex­trem­ist fo­rums.</p>
    <p>“Dig­i­tal plat­forms of­fer new means to spread ex­trem­ist pro­pa­ganda to a wider group of com­mu­ni­ties. Their de­signs and al­go­rithms can also cre­ate echo cham­bers and en­trench ex­trem­ist be­liefs,” Mr Tan said.</p>
    <p>There is thus a need for Sin­ga­pore to en­hance its frame­work and de­vise new strate­gies to counter on­line se­cu­rity threats, he said.</p>
    <p>The On­line iSSWG will al­low the po­lice to tap the AIC’s net­work of 15 tech com­pa­nies to ob­tain in­sights that can help fight ter­ror­ism and other on­line crimes.</p>
    <p>In a me­dia state­ment yes­ter­day, the po­lice said the watch group will also en­hance pub­lic aware­ness of scam tac­tics and cy­ber safety.</p>
    <p>Scams in­volv­ing e-com­merce, me­dia im­per­son­ation, loans and bank­ing-re­lated phish­ing are ar­eas of con­cern to Sin­ga­pore. The po­lice said these four cat­e­gories made up 71 per cent of the top 10 scam types re­ported in the first half of last year.</p>
    <p>The watch group is the sev­enth set up by the po­lice with in­dus­try part­ners to ad­dress in­dus­try-spe­cific safety and se­cu­rity con­cerns, such as in the chem­i­cal, fi­nan­cial and ho­tel sec­tors.</p>
    <p>The new watch group was wel­comed by AIC mem­bers.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Face­book said: “For years, we have worked closely with a range of stake­hold­ers in Sin­ga­pore – in­clud­ing the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force – to in­form and ed­u­cate users on how they can stay safe on­line. We warmly wel­come the for­ma­tion of the On­line iSSWG and Face­book looks for­ward to col­lab­o­rat­ing with the other mem­bers of the AIC on this new ini­tia­tive.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said that crim­i­nals and ter­ror­ists will con­tinue to be in­ven­tive and ex­ploit the vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties of the vir­tual space, and it was im­per­a­tive that the au­thor­i­ties here stay one step ahead of them.</p>
    <p>“Our com­mu­nity part­ner­ships must go be­yond the phys­i­cal sphere, in­volv­ing busi­ness part­ners and en­ti­ties on­line, to strengthen the ecosys­tem for a more ef­fec­tive and co­or­di­nated re­sponse to these threats,” he said.</p>
