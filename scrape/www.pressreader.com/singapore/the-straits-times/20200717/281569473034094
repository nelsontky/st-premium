    <p>Clarence Chang Peng Hong, 55, a for­mer man­ager at oil gi­ant BP, was found guilty yes­ter­day of re­ceiv­ing US$3.95 mil­lion (S$5.5 mil­lion) in bribes from busi­ness­man Koh Seng Lee. Chang ac­cepted bribes from Koh on 19 oc­ca­sions be­tween July 2006 and July 2010 in ex­change for ad­vanc­ing Koh’s busi­ness in­ter­ests with BP.</p>
    <p>A for­mer man­ager at oil gi­ant BP was found guilty yes­ter­day of re­ceiv­ing US$3.95 mil­lion (S$5.5 mil­lion) in bribes from a busi­ness­man, who was also con­victed.</p>
    <p>Clarence Chang Peng Hong, 55, had ac­cepted bribes from busi­ness­man Koh Seng Lee on 19 oc­ca­sions be­tween July 2006 and July 2010, in ex­change for ad­vanc­ing the busi­ness in­ter­ests of Koh’s com­pany with BP, a district judge ruled.</p>
    <p>Koh, 58, had sep­a­rately also cor­ruptly agreed to pay $500,000 to a pre-school – MindChamps PreSchool @ City Square – where Chang’s wife is a di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Chang and Koh were each found guilty yes­ter­day of 20 cor­rup­tion charges, fol­low­ing a trial span­ning two years.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the trial, the court heard that Koh had set up a marine fuel trad­ing com­pany, Pa­cific Prime Trad­ing (PPT), at Chang’s sug­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>The two had a “mu­tual un­der­stand­ing” from the start, said Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Jiang Ke-Yue and Loh Hui-Min, that Chang would use his po­si­tion in BP Sin­ga­pore to ad­vance PPT’s in­ter­est, in re­turn for a “share” of PPT’s prof­its.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors said that “from the very out­set, Koh was be­holden to Chang”.</p>
    <p>“Over time, the afore­said ar­range­ment be­came fur­ther en­trenched as PPT’s busi­ness with BP Sin­ga­pore flour­ished,” said the pros­e­cu­tors.</p>
    <p>They also ar­gued that Koh knew that Chang had the power to “make or break” PPT, and felt com­pelled to ac­cede to Chang’s re­quests for pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Chang was also “be­holden to place PPT’s in­ter­ests above that of his prin­ci­pal, BP Sin­ga­pore”, as he stood to pros­per with PPT, said the pros­e­cu­tors.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, de­fence coun­sel for the two men ar­gued that the fund trans­fers be­tween the two were for joint in­vest­ments in prop­erty and in MindChamps, and were wholly un­re­lated to PPT’s busi­ness with BP Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>How­ever, District Judge Ong Chin Rhu said in court yes­ter­day that the ac­counts of joint in­vest­ments were an af­ter­thought.</p>
    <p>It was “telling” that both Chang’s and Koh’s state­ments per­tain­ing to these joint in­vest­ments con­tained “glar­ing con­tra­dic­tions and in­con­sis­ten­cies”, said the judge.</p>
    <p>The duo are out on bail of $200,000 each, and will be back in court on Sept 7 for their sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>For each charge of cor­rup­tion, Koh and Chang can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $100,000.</p>
