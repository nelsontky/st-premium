    <p>Here’s the thing about thrill rides – they never seem that scary un­til you are ac­tu­ally on them.</p>
    <p>While await­ing our turn for the AJ Hack­ett Sen­tosa giant swing, I watch gig­gling rid­ers pale as they are hoisted from the ground to about 15 storeys high, then hear their screams as they hur­tle for­ward in a mas­sive arc.</p>
    <p>But in com­par­i­son to the bungee jump, which I am pet­ri­fied of, the swing seems fun and non-threat­en­ing – like a larger ver­sion of the Vik­ing ship ride at amuse­ment parks that goes up to 120kmh.</p>
    <p>AJ Hack­ett Sen­tosa gen­eral man­ager Luke John­son likens it to the en­tree of a meal, a be­gin­ner­friendly op­tion be­fore one at­tempts the bungee.</p>
    <p>Some en­tree it is. Mid­way through the as­cent, I be­gin to think these are all poor com­par­isons.</p>
    <p>Dan­gling by a body har­ness while the ground pulls away and tree­tops come into view, one feels ex­tremely small and vul­ner­a­ble. Cy­clists and beach­go­ers look like they are part of a dio­rama.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, the fate of my com­pan­ion and I, strapped in side by side, lies in my hands. The swing be­gins only when I yank a re­lease cord that sends us swoop­ing down. Fail to muster the courage and we will be left dan­gling for­ever.</p>
    <p>If you have ever teetered at the top of a roller­coaster, you know the plunge is in­evitable, the agony over quickly.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing con­trol of the ex­pe­ri­ence is part of AJ Hack­ett Sen­tosa’s ap­peal, the dif­fer­ence be­tween tak­ing a ride and do­ing an ac­tiv­ity. It all sounds very em­pow­er­ing, but only for those with nerves of steel. I won­der if any­one has needed res­cue at the top.</p>
    <p>To­day, we are spared that ig­nominy. Af­ter a brief hes­i­ta­tion, I pull hard, and we are off. This is more than a stom­ach-drop­ping plunge – I feel my en­tire weight plum­met­ing and in­stinc­tively stretch out my arms to break the fall.</p>
    <p>But there is no fall, only a hard tug as we swoop for­ward, high above Siloso beach, shriek­ing un­til the swing slows.</p>
    <p>If you are go­ing on the bungee</p>
    <p>jump next, the giant swing will whet your ap­petite.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, it is an adren­a­line high you can savour for the rest of the af­ter­noon. Def­i­nitely a shared me­mory you can re­trieve to have a good laugh over, again and again.</p>
