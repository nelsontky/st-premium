    <p>Par­ents who were hop­ing to clinch a spot for their chil­dren at 99 pop­u­lar pri­mary schools in Phase 2C of the Pri­mary 1 regis­tra­tion ex­er­cise will have to face a bal­lot. Phase 2C, the fifth of seven phases in the regis­tra­tion ex­er­cise, is con­sid­ered the most com­pet­i­tive as it sees the most num­ber of schools need­ing a bal­lot com­pared with ear­lier stages.</p>
    <p>Par­ents who were hop­ing to clinch a spot for their chil­dren at 99 pop­u­lar pri­mary schools in Phase 2C of the Pri­mary 1 regis­tra­tion ex­er­cise will have to face a bal­lot.</p>
    <p>The schools in­clude Princess El­iz­a­beth Pri­mary, where 226 chil­dren are vy­ing for 38 places; Te­masek Pri­mary with 106 chil­dren try­ing for 28 va­can­cies; and West Spring Pri­mary, where there are 45 places and 126 chil­dren reg­is­tered.</p>
    <p>An­other two schools – Jurong West Pri­mary and Paya Le­bar Methodist Girls’ School (Pri­mary) – were over­sub­scribed in Phase 2C but will not re­quire bal­lot­ing, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures on the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) web­site which were up­dated late on Wed­nes­day night.</p>
    <p>Jurong West Pri­mary has places only for Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen chil­dren, while Paya Le­bar Methodist</p>
    <p>Girls’ School (Pri­mary) will ad­mit Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen chil­dren re­sid­ing within 1km of the school.</p>
    <p>For the other over­sub­scribed schools, the re­sults of the bal­lot will be out next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Those whose ap­pli­ca­tions are un­suc­cess­ful can regis­ter in Phase 2C Sup­ple­men­tary, start­ing next Wed­nes­day, for a place in a school with va­can­cies.</p>
    <p>Last year, 87 schools were over­sub­scribed in Phase 2C, with 81 even­tu­ally go­ing to a bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Phase 2C is the fifth of seven phases in the regis­tra­tion ex­er­cise and is for chil­dren with no ties to the schools. It is con­sid­ered the most com­pet­i­tive as it sees the most num­ber of schools need­ing a bal­lot com­pared with ear­lier stages.</p>
    <p>From this year, the MOE has in­tro­duced a cap on the in­take of per­ma­nent res­i­dent chil­dren in se­lected pri­mary schools that ap­plies in Phase 2C and 2C Sup­ple­men­tary.</p>
    <p>The cap is be­tween 25 per cent and 30 per cent of a school’s planned Pri­mary 1 in­take.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure is to “pre­vent any con­cen­tra­tion of PR chil­dren in our pri­mary schools, pro­vide a more con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment to en­cour­age in­ter­ac­tion be­tween Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen and PR chil­dren, and fa­cil­i­tate the in­te­gra­tion of PR chil­dren into Sin­ga­pore”, the min­istry has pre­vi­ously said.</p>
    <p>It added that the vast ma­jor­ity of pri­mary schools and PR chil­dren will not be af­fected by this change, as past in­takes show PR ad­mis­sions are “well below the cap of 25 per cent to 30 per cent”.</p>
    <p>For this year, the cap will be ap­plied in 10 schools: Bukit Timah Pri­mary, Bukit View Pri­mary, Changkat Pri­mary, Green­dale Pri­mary, Mary­mount Con­vent, North Spring Pri­mary, Opera Es­tate Pri­mary, Pi­o­neer Pri­mary, Tan­jong Ka­tong Pri­mary and Xing­nan Pri­mary.</p>
    <p>Of these 10 schools, Bukit Timah Pri­mary and Opera Es­tate Pri­mary were over­sub­scribed in Phase 2C.</p>
    <p>All the Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen chil­dren who ap­plied to both schools have been ad­mit­ted, and bal­lot­ing will be con­ducted for PR chil­dren re­sid­ing near the schools. Both schools have reached the PR cap.</p>
    <p>Tan­jong Ka­tong Pri­mary was also over­sub­scribed, but has not reached the PR in­take limit.</p>
    <p>The other seven schools were not over­sub­scribed in this phase.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, the MOE will re­view and pub­lish yearly the list of schools that will have to re­flect a cap on their in­take of PR chil­dren.</p>
    <p>From this year, the MOE has in­tro­duced a cap on the in­take of per­ma­nent res­i­dent chil­dren in se­lected pri­mary schools that ap­plies in Phase 2C and 2C Sup­ple­men­tary. The cap is be­tween</p>
    <p>25 per cent and 30 per cent of a school’s planned Pri­mary 1 in­take.</p>
