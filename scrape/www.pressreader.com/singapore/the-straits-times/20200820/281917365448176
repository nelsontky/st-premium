    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Rus­sia used Re­pub­li­can po­lit­i­cal op­er­a­tive Paul Manafort and the Wik­iLeaks web­site to try to help Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump win the 2016 elec­tion, a Re­pub­li­can-led Se­nate com­mit­tee has said in its fi­nal re­view of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Wik­iLeaks played a key role in Rus­sia’s ef­fort to as­sist Re­pub­li­can Mr Trump’s cam­paign against Demo­crat Hil­lary Clin­ton and likely knew it was help­ing Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence, said the 966-page re­port re­leased on Tues­day, which is likely to be the most de­fin­i­tive public ac­count of the 2016 elec­tion con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>The re­port f ound Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin per­son­ally di­rected the Rus­sian ef­forts to hack com­puter net­works and ac­counts af­fil­i­ated with the Demo­cratic Party and leak in­for­ma­tion dam­ag­ing to Mrs Clin­ton.</p>
    <p>Asked about the re­port at an event i n Yuma, Ari­zona, Mr Trump said: “I don’t know any­thing about it. I didn’t read it.”</p>
    <p>“It’s all a hoax,” Mr Trump told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The Se­nate Se­lect Com­mit­tee on In­tel­li­gence al­leged Manafort col­lab­o­rated with Rus­sians, in­clud­ing oli­garch Oleg Deri­paska and “Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cer” Kon­stantin Kil­imnik, be­fore, dur­ing and after the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The panel found Manafort’s role and prox­im­ity to Mr Trump cre­ated op­por­tu­ni­ties for Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence, say­ing his “high-level ac­cess and will­ing­ness to share in­for­ma­tion with in­di­vid­u­als closely af­fil­i­ated with the Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence ser­vices... rep­re­sented a grave counter-in­tel­li­gence threat”.</p>
    <p>It was not clear what ef­fect, if any, the re­port might have on the cur­rent pres­i­den­tial cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump will face Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s al­leged elec­tion in­ter­fer­ence, which Moscow de­nies, sparked a two-year-long US in­ves­ti­ga­tion headed by spe­cial coun­sel Robert Mueller.</p>
    <p>In a re­port re­leased last year, Mr Mueller found no con­clu­sive ev­i­dence of co­or­di­na­tion be­tween Rus­sia and the Trump cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and his sup­port­ers have con­sis­tently bris­tled at sug­ges­tions that for­eign in­ter­fer­ence helped him pull off his up­set vic­tory in 2016.</p>
    <p>Bi­den cam­paign spokesman An­drew Bates said Mr Trump wel­comed Rus­sian as­sis­tance in 2016 “with open arms”.</p>
    <p>“Don­ald Trump may be­lieve that the Rus­sian govern­ment should have a say in our elec­tions, but it is for the Amer­i­can peo­ple to de­cide,” he added.</p>
    <p>Wik­iLeaks, founded by Ju­lian As­sange, pub­lished thou­sands of emails hacked from Mrs Clin­ton’s cam­paign and a top cam­paign aide in the weeks be­fore the 2016 elec­tion, yield­ing a drum­beat of neg­a­tive cov­er­age about the Demo­crat.</p>
    <p>As Rus­sian mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence and Wik­iLeaks re­leased the hacked doc­u­ments, the re­port said Mr Trump’s cam­paign sought ad­vance no­tice, de­vised mes­sag­ing strate­gies to am­plify them “and en­cour­aged fur­ther theft of in­for­ma­tion and... leaks”.</p>
    <p>“The Trump cam­paign pub­licly un­der­mined the at­tri­bu­tion of the hack-and-leak cam­paign to Rus­sia and was in­dif­fer­ent to whether it and Wik­iLeaks were fur­ther­ing a Rus­sian elec­tion in­ter­fer­ence ef­fort,” the re­port added.</p>
    <p>Sen­tenced last year to 71/ years</p>
    <p>2 in jail, 71-year-old Manafort was re­leased in May to home con­fine­ment to pro­tect him from the coro­n­avirus threat. Mr Trump has re­peat­edly sug­gested he could par­don Manafort.</p>
