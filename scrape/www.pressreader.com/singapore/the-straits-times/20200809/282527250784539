    <p>Yoga teacher and per­sonal trainer Alyaa Rauff, 26, was talk­ing on the phone out­side a fit­ness stu­dio two years ago when a woman work­ing at a nearby store took pho­tos of her.</p>
    <p>When ques­tioned, she ac­cused Ms Alyaa of be­ing a “sus­pi­cious In­dian girl” who was about to steal from her, and said she was tak­ing pho­tos to show the po­lice.</p>
    <p>The woman’s col­league de­fused the sit­u­a­tion, but it left Ms Alyaa shaken. When she posted about it on In­sta­gram later that day, strangers mes­saged her to ac­cuse her of ly­ing or said it was her fault for “loi­ter­ing” near the woman’s shop.</p>
    <p>“Just be­cause peo­ple don’t see or ex­pe­ri­ence these things, they think it doesn’t hap­pen in Sin­ga­pore,” says Ms Alyaa.</p>
    <p>Last month, she re­counted the in­ci­dent on online plat­form Mi­nor­ity Voices (@mi­nor­i­tyvoices on In­sta­gram), which bills it­self as a “safe space to share ex­pe­ri­ences of racism and dis­crim­i­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>Launched in May, it has gar­nered about 8,800 fol­low­ers in three months, and is among a hand­ful of plat­forms that re­flect a grow­ing de­sire by today’s so­cial-me­dia gen­er­a­tion to dis­cuss race-re­lated is­sues.</p>
    <p>An­other plat­form, Lepak Con­ver­sa­tions (@lep­ak­con­ver­sa­tions), en­cour­ages re­spect­ful dis­cus­sions about things that mat­ter to Sin­ga­pore’s Malay-Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Launched by two 22-year-olds – a stu­dent and a graphic de­signer – to ex­am­ine race re­la­tions in the leadup to last month’s Gen­eral Elec­tion (GE), it has about 2,700 fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>When it comes to talk­ing about race, many Sin­ga­pore­ans re­main cau­tious.</p>
    <p>In a 2016 sur­vey on race re­la­tions by Chan­nel NewsAsia and the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies, about two-thirds of re­spon­dents felt that talk­ing about race could cause un­nec­es­sary of­fence and ten­sion.</p>
    <p>Dr Peter Chew, a se­nior psy­chol­ogy lec­turer at James Cook Uni­ver­sity Sin­ga­pore, be­lieves that so­cial­i­sa­tion by par­ents and the Gov­ern­ment, in­clud­ing strict laws such as the Sedi­tion Act and Main­te­nance of Re­li­gious Har­mony Act, make Sin­ga­pore­ans tip­toe around the topic.</p>
    <p>The aca­demic, who pub­lished a 2018 pa­per ti­tled Racism In Sin­ga­pore in the Jour­nal Of Pa­cific Rim Psy­chol­ogy, adds: “There seems to be a per­cep­tion that we should avoid top­ics on race and reli­gion to pre­serve racial har­mony.”</p>
    <p>But times are chang­ing. Recog­nis­ing that young peo­ple are more open to talk­ing about such is­sues, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said dur­ing an online GE rally on July 8 that more of these con­ver­sa­tions can be held, but also noted such sen­si­tive mat­ters can cause grave um­brage and so must be han­dled del­i­cately.</p>
    <p>Last month, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said at an online di­a­logue or­gan­ised by OnePeo­ple.sg, a na­tional body that pro­motes racial and re­li­gious har­mony, that younger Sin­ga­pore­ans must de­cide where to draw bound­aries on dis­cus­sions on race and reli­gion, and lead ground-up ef­forts to bring these dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions into their re­spec­tive com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Former ed­u­ca­tion min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung also said last month that the min­istry is en­cour­ag­ing schools to fa­cil­i­tate more in-depth con­ver­sa­tion, such as dur­ing char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion classes.</p>
    <p>The first step to hav­ing this con­ver­sa­tion, says Dr Chew, is ac­knowl­edg­ing that racism and dis­crim­i­na­tion ex­ist here.</p>
    <p>Among youth, he says, the In­ter­net is a lev­eller, al­low­ing them to un­der­stand the many man­i­fes­ta­tions of racism and the ef­fect it has on mi­nor­ity groups.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to have con­struc­tive dis­cus­sions be­cause at a min­i­mum, it would ac­knowl­edge that racism is an is­sue in Sin­ga­pore,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Mi­nor­ity Voices co-founder Sharvesh Leatch­manan, 23, who is do­ing a coun­selling de­gree at pri­vate ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tion Ka­plan Sin­ga­pore, also be­lieves the first step to­wards change is ac­cept­ing that dis­crim­i­na­tion ex­ists.</p>
    <p>“When you lis­ten to some­one telling you what they went through, it can change peo­ple’s opin­ions, the way they think and the way they treat peo­ple around them,” he says.</p>
    <p>In­deed, many con­trib­u­tors re­late mi­croag­gres­sions – a term that de­scribes com­mon ver­bal, be­havioural or en­vi­ron­men­tal in­dig­ni­ties – that can be avoided with a lit­tle em­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a young girl is named af­ter an In­dian god­dess, but re­lates how she of­ten has her name ridiculed by class­mates and even a teacher. A teenage Malay boy, born and bred here, is teased about be­ing a for­eign worker and need­ing a work per­mit to study here.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers de­scribe be­ing turned away from jobs on ac­count of their skin colour or dis­tanc­ing them­selves from their own cul­ture to fit into the larger so­ci­ety here.</p>
    <p>Ms Alyaa says: “I don’t think I’ve met an­other mi­nor­ity in Sin­ga­pore and not had a con­ver­sa­tion along these lines. It helps that peo­ple know they are not alone and some­one else has gone through that too.”</p>
    <p>Ms Veena Tadikonda, 22, the other co-founder of Mi­nor­ity Voices, says she started the plat­form to bet­ter un­der­stand racial dis­crim­i­na­tion her­self.</p>
    <p>The law un­der­grad­u­ate at Durham Uni­ver­sity in Bri­tain met Mr Sharvesh online through her room­mate while re­cov­er­ing from Covid-19 at a com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­ity in March. She be­lieves she caught the virus on her flight home.</p>
    <p>“I came across a video online that felt of­fen­sive, even though I could not ar­tic­u­late why. At that time, I didn’t know what terms like mi­croag­gres­sions meant,” she says. The kids’ sin­ga­long video fea­tured Chi­nese kids dressed in saris mak­ing curry, which she felt made a car­i­ca­ture of mi­nor­ity races.</p>
    <p>“(Mi­nor­ity Voices) started out as some­thing we were do­ing just for us, but we later re­alised it has the po­ten­tial to make sig­nif­i­cant change,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Founders of such plat­forms here try to take a less per­sonal, more in­for­ma­tive tack.</p>
    <p>Cape, or the Com­mu­nity for Ad­vo­cacy & Po­lit­i­cal Ed­u­ca­tion, is a Yale-NUS-based group that tries to build lit­er­acy and aware­ness of a breadth of is­sues that af­fect so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing pace with today’s so­cial­me­dia trends, in­for­ma­tion is pre­sented via in­fo­graph­ics on its In­sta­gram page (@cape.sg), which has about 11,100 fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Cape has tack­led race-re­lated is­sues such as in­ter­sec­tion­al­ity, which refers to how one’s lived ex­pe­ri­ences are af­fected by fac­tors such as gen­der, so­cio-eco­nomic sta­tus and sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Lepak Con­ver­sa­tions, whose founders de­clined to be named as they do not want their per­sonal views to af­fect the i nfor­ma­tion pre­sented, also posts bite-sized in­fo­graph­ics on race-re­lated is­sues.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the long-stand­ing de­bate, for ex­am­ple, on whether front-line work­ers should be al­lowed to wear the tudung, or Mus­lim head­scarf.</p>
    <p>It has also delved into cul­tural ap­pro­pri­a­tion, which oc­curs when mem­bers of a dom­i­nant group in­ap­pro­pri­ately rep­re­sent a cul­ture or its cus­toms. In this dis­cus­sion, founders brought up the “brown­face” con­tro­versy last year, where a Chi­nese ac­tor painted his face brown to de­pict an In­dian man, as well as wore a tudung to de­pict a Malay woman, in an ad­ver­tise­ment.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing on sources such as news re­ports, par­lia­men­tary de­bates and the Con­sti­tu­tion, a co-founder of Lepak Con­ver­sa­tions says it aims to present both sides of the is­sue in a fac­tual and bal­anced way.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple tend to steer clear of dis­cussing race and reli­gion in their daily life as they are afraid of back­lash or be­ing seen as too sen­si­tive. We hope peo­ple will take the con­ver­sa­tion off­line and go on their own jour­ney of un­der­stand­ing race re­la­tions in Sin­ga­pore,” she says.</p>
    <p>For pub­lic ser­vant Ni­co­lette Ann, 30, read­ing such ac­counts of­fers a broader per­spec­tive of how oth­ers in Sin­ga­pore view race-re­lated is­sues.</p>
    <p>“So­cial me­dia can be an echo cham­ber, so I want to in­form my un­der­stand­ing of what other peo­ple think or why they might be trig­gered,” she says.</p>
    <p>Con­trib­u­tors to such plat­forms say it has been em­pow­er­ing to bring their ex­pe­ri­ences to light.</p>
    <p>Some use their sto­ries to in­spire oth­ers who are in their shoes, while oth­ers of­fer prac­ti­cal ways to make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Ma­ha­lak­shmi V. Karthigeya­n, 31, who con­tributed her story to Mi­nor­ity Voices, says that grow­ing up, she was teased by class­mates about her curly hair.</p>
    <p>In­se­cure and ashamed, she went through end­less rounds of re­bond­ing and chem­i­cal treat­ments to straighten her hair, de­vel­op­ing a dry scalp and alope­cia (hair loss) in the process.</p>
    <p>She now em­braces her nat­u­ral hair and sells hair prod­ucts for fel­low “curlies”, such as deep con­di­tioner made with oat milk.</p>
    <p>“I work to ed­u­cate, en­cour­age and give con­fi­dence to gen­er­a­tions af­ter me, so that how they look should never be a bar­rier to what they can achieve,” she says.</p>
    <p>Fel­low con­trib­u­tor Tabitha Thomp­son, 23, born to an African Amer­i­can fa­ther and Sin­ga­porean In­dian mother, has also over­come the racial slurs and bul­ly­ing from her child­hood and l earnt to be com­fort­able in her own skin.</p>
    <p>The nail artist hopes the Black Lives Mat­ter protests will open Sin­ga­pore­ans’ eyes to the dis­crim­i­na­tion that takes place here too.</p>
    <p>She ex­horts: “Stand up for any in­jus­tice you see, re­gard­less of the con­text.</p>
    <p>“Speak up when peo­ple around you make racist jokes or com­ments, make a com­plaint when you see racism in your school or work­place, and ed­u­cate one an­other.”</p>
