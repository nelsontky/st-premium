    <p>WELLINGTON • New Zealand has ruled out the pos­si­bil­ity that a coro­n­avirus out­break in its big­gest city Auck­land came from frozen food items or freight.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions sug­gested the virus had not come through chilled ser­vices or ma­te­rial ar­riv­ing from over­seas at an Ameri­cold cold-stor­age fa­cil­ity in Auck­land, where one of the re­cently in­fected in­di­vid­u­als worked, health of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“(It) seems clear now that the pos­si­bil­ity is be­ing ruled out from that in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” Di­rec­tor-Gen­eral of Health Ash­ley Bloom­field told reporters.</p>
    <p>The ori­gin of the lat­est out­break is still un­known, and trans­mis­sion through the en­vi­ron­ment in the cold stor­age was one the­ory be­ing con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>New Zealand cel­e­brated when the coun­try passed 100 days with­out any com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion ear­lier this month. But an abrupt resur­gence of Covid-19 last week in Auck­land prompted the gov­ern­ment to ex­tend a lockdown for the city’s 1.7 mil­lion res­i­dents un­til next Wed­nes­day, while so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules are in place in other towns and cities.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional 13 cases were re­ported in the com­mu­nity yes­ter­day. New Zealand’s to­tal num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions now stands at 1,643, with 22 deaths.</p>
    <p>New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern hit back yes­ter­day at US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump for say­ing that her coun­try is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a “big surge” in Covid-19, call­ing the re­marks “patently wrong”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump sparked an up­roar in New Zealand when he told a crowd in Min­nesota that the coun­try of five mil­lion peo­ple was in the grip of a “ter­ri­ble” up­surge in Covid-19 cases, hav­ing ear­lier suc­ceeded in elim­i­nat­ing the disease.</p>
    <p>“You see what is go­ing on in New Zealand?” Mr Trump had said. “They beat it, they beat it, it was like front page, they beat it... be­cause they wanted to show me some­thing.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem is... big surge in New Zealand, you know it is ter­ri­ble. We don’t want that.”</p>
    <p>The United States has some 5.6 mil­lion cases and more than 170,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said there was no com­par­i­son be­tween New Zealand’s hand­ful of new cases a day and the “tens of thou­sands” re­ported in the US.</p>
    <p>“I think any­one who is fol­low­ing Covid-19 and its trans­mis­sion glob­ally will quite eas­ily see that New Zealand’s nine cases in a day do not com­pare to the United States’ tens of thou­sands, and in fact do not com­pare to most coun­tries in the world,” she told reporters.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, it is patently wrong,” she said of Mr Trump’s com­ments.</p>
    <p>With an elec­tion due in midOc­to­ber, Ms Ardern is keen to re­mind vot­ers of her gov­ern­ment’s track record in fight­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>“Every other sin­gle coun­try in the world has ex­pe­ri­enced resur­gence. We went l onger than many, our out­break is cer­tainly not as sig­nif­i­cant as what we are see­ing i n Viet­nam, i n Hong Kong, in South Korea or in Aus­tralia,” she told state broad­caster TVNZ.</p>
    <p>Num­ber of cases re­ported in the com­mu­nity yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>New Zealand’s to­tal num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions now stands at 1,643, with 22 deaths.</p>
