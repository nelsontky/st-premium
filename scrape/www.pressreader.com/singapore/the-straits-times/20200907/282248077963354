    <p>In­vestors got a scare last Thurs­day when tech stocks on Wall Street tum­bled sharply and dragged the broader eq­uity mar­kets lower.</p>
    <p>The big five tech titans led the de­clines. Ap­ple fell 8 per cent while Mi­crosoft and Al­pha­bet slipped 6.2 per cent and 5.1 per cent, re­spec­tively. Re­cent tech dar­lings like Sales­force.com fell 4.2 per cent and Tesla dropped more than</p>
    <p>18 per cent since its stock split took ef­fect last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The tech sell-off is a good re­minder for in­vestors to not be com­pla­cent and keep in mind that the mar­ket moves in two direc­tions.</p>
    <p>The les­son is par­tic­u­larly painful, given the un­re­lent­ing string of gains over the past few weeks that brought the S&P 500 in­dex to record highs al­most on a daily ba­sis, de­spite a limp­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, these gains were driven by a nar­row base of stocks, namely the mega-cap tech giants – Face­book, Ap­ple, Ama­zon, Al­pha­bet and Mi­crosoft – which ac­count for al­most 25 per cent of the in­dex based on mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Other growth stocks have joined the party, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>Sales­force.com, Tesla and other pre­dom­i­nantly tech com­pa­nies that are lever­aged to sec­u­lar growth trends like cloud com­put­ing, 5G and the like.</p>
    <p>On a for­ward price-to-earn­ings ba­sis, the S&P 500 in­dex and Nas­daq com­pos­ite in­dex are al­ready trad­ing at more than three stan­dard de­vi­a­tions above their seven-year av­er­age. Val­u­a­tions based on next year’s ar­guably nor­malised earn­ings fore­cast still look rather ex­tended. The key mes­sage is that stocks, es­pe­cially tech stocks, are not cheap.</p>
    <p>SELL-OFF NOT UN­EX­PECTED</p>
    <p>The tech sell-off was not to­tally un­ex­pected, es­pe­cially on the heels of a mas­sive rally in Au­gust. De­spite con­cerns that mar­kets have been run­ning ahead of fun­da­men­tals in the face of eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and earn­ings un­cer­tain­ties, the S&P 500 in­dex con­tin­ued to march higher, driven by in­vestor sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>Fac­tors such as Ap­ple and Tesla’s stock splits had also su­per charged the re­cent tech-driven rally, which was nei­ther sup­ported by bet­ter earn­ings out­look nor im­prov­ing fun­da­men­tals.</p>
    <p>Some mar­ket con­sol­i­da­tion is in­deed war­ranted – healthy even – serv­ing as a re­minder that what goes up can just as eas­ily come down.</p>
    <p>It is too early to tell if last Thurs­day’s sell-off is a one-off slip or the start of a mean­ing­ful de­cline for the stock mar­ket and es­pe­cially tech stocks.</p>
    <p>From a longer-term per­spec­tive, it is quite likely that the bull run is not over. The longer-term pic­ture re­mains con­ducive for risk as­sets on ac­count of a nor­mal­is­ing busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, a mod­er­ate eco­nomic re­cov­ery and very loose mon­e­tary pol­icy.</p>
    <p>As such, bouts of volatil­ity can be seen as op­por­tu­ni­ties to in­cre­men­tally add ex­po­sure at more favourable pric­ing.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, given the sharp rally in tech coun­ters, the sell-off last week may be a sig­nal that in­vestors and traders are get­ting ner­vous about the sec­tor, at least in the short term, and we could see some funds switch­ing out into cycli­cals and value stocks which have un­der­per­formed.</p>
    <p>This is not to sug­gest that in­vestors will or should aban­don tech stocks. On the con­trary, the sec­tor will re­main a core com­po­nent of port­fo­lios given that tech­nol­ogy is poised to drive ma­jor changes in the way in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses op­er­ate in the com­ing years and decades.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy is clearly a multi-year theme and, un­like the dot­com bub­ble that burst in 2000, the rally in tech stocks this time around has a much stronger ba­sis if you are pre­pared to look out over the next decade and pro­vided you have a strong risk ap­petite and can stom­ach sharp price volatil­ity.</p>
    <p>So do not give up on tech stocks but do not put all your eggs into one bas­ket ei­ther. Al­though tech has been the dar­ling of stock mar­kets so far this year, do not ig­nore non-tech stocks that have un­der­per­formed.</p>
    <p>His­tory tells us that it is un­wise to over-in­vest in one sec­tor or theme and it is im­por­tant to have a diver­si­fied port­fo­lio to hedge against the un­cer­tain­ties ahead, in­clud­ing tech and non-tech names and even bonds and gold as well.</p>
    <p>At the same time, keep some dry pow­der even though in­ter­est rates are very low right now and it makes lit­tle sense to hold too much cash. Nev­er­the­less, have some standby cash to cap­i­talise on the volatil­ity ahead; and you can be sure that you will get quite a bit of that in the run-up to the US elec­tions in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Get ready for a choppy ride but it may still be too early to give up on tech stocks and eq­uity mar­kets just yet.</p>
