    <p>It could be the lan­guage bar­rier, or his in­tro­verted na­ture, but Keiji Shige­tomi is a man not prone to over­state­ment.</p>
    <p>Even then, the nor­mally ret­i­cent Al­birex Ni­igata coach ad­mit­ted be­ing in charge of the Ja­panese club comes with high ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Through a trans­la­tor, he told The Straits Times: “Al­birex have been suc­cess­ful in re­cent years, so the pres­sure to win the league is there.</p>
    <p>“It was the same in 2019 and this year, and I am thank­ful to the club man­age­ment for their sup­port.”</p>
    <p>The stress is real be­cause Al­birex claimed a hat-trick of Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) ti­tles from 2016 to 2018 – the White Swans even went un­beaten in the last of those three sea­sons.</p>
    <p>But, af­ter Shige­tomi took over from Kazuaki Yoshi­naga last year, the club slipped to fourth.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Shige­tomi, 41, has a chance to em­u­late his pre­de­ces­sor and be­come an SPL cham­pion him­self if his team win at Hougang United to­day in the sea­son fi­nale.</p>
    <p>Al­birex lead the ta­ble on 29 points, one ahead of Tampines Rovers, who host Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional this evening.</p>
    <p>Al­birex man­ager Koh Mui Tee ex</p>
    <p>NEVER SAY DIE</p>
    <p>This year, my team are bal­anced, and ev­ery Ja­panese and local player has been key. They have been brave and showed their strong will to win by giv­ing their all even deep into added time.</p>
    <p>plained why the club kept faith with Shige­tomi, de­spite the dip in re­sults.</p>
    <p>He said: “There were mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors, such as the rule change for us to play two local play­ers in the first half. We have known Shige­tomi for many years, and we wanted to give a rookie head coach more time to de­velop.”</p>
    <p>Shige­tomi played high school foot­ball but it was the tac­ti­cal as­pect of the game that ap­pealed to him and he went on to coach at Oshu Soc­cer Club as a 20-year-old.</p>
    <p>He then coached the San­frecce Hiroshima youth teams be­fore be­ing in­vited by Al­birex chair­man Daisuke Kore­naga to join the Al­birex Ni­igata Soc­cer School in Sin­ga­pore in 2014.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the Shi­mane na­tive ex­pressed his in­ter­est to be in­volved with the se­nior team and was ap­pointed Yoshi­naga’s as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>He said: “I learnt many things from coach Yoshi­naga in terms of tac­tics and man-man­age­ment. When I took over, I ap­plied what I learnt and added my own phi­los­o­phy of press­ing and at­tack­ing foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>He places a pre­mium on fit­ness in his six-day morn­ing train­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>In an SPL sea­son dis­rupted and trun­cated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, that abil­ity to out­run and out­last their op­po­nents has been de­ci­sive for Al­birex, who have scored 10 of their 31 goals this sea­son in the last 15 min­utes of their matches.</p>
    <p>Since the com­pe­ti­tion’s restart on Oct 18, they have com­piled the best record in the eight-team league and won eight of their 10 games even with two losses to Tampines.</p>
    <p>The Stags how­ever, have been more in­con­sis­tent, los­ing once and draw­ing four times in that same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>While Al­birex are poised to claim their fourth cham­pi­onship in five years, they have had their de­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>Gey­lang coach Noor Ali, af­ter a 1-0 de­feat last month, was crit­i­cal of the Ja­panese club and said they were one-di­men­sional and un­like the free-flow­ing, at­tack­ing ver­sion of past Al­birex teams.</p>
    <p>Shige­tomi re­sponded: “The win­ning teams from 2016 and 2018 had their own unique qual­i­ties. And in 2018, we had SPL Player of the Year Wataru Muro­fushi, Golden Boot win­ner Shuhei Hoshino and Young Player of the Year Adam Swandi, to carry the team.</p>
    <p>“This year, my team are bal­anced, and ev­ery Ja­panese and local player has been key.</p>
    <p>“They have been brave and showed their strong will to win by giv­ing their all even deep into added time.</p>
    <p>“We will do the same at Hougang. They may be without their im­ports but they still have many good play­ers such as Shawal Anuar, Shah­fiq Ghani and An­ders Aplin, and we will not un­der­es­ti­mate them.</p>
    <p>“It will be an hon­our to win the SPL with this group, but first we must fo­cus on se­cur­ing the three points.”</p>
