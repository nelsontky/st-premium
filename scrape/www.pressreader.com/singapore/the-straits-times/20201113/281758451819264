    <p>PETALING JAYA • Malaysia’s Se­lan­gor state has topped the list with over 41,000 dengue cases com­pared with other states na­tion­wide so far this year, and this is ex­pected to in­crease un­til early next year, said a health ex­pert.</p>
    <p>Univer­siti Malaya vi­rol­ogy and bac­te­ri­ol­ogy ex­pert Sazaly Abu Bakar said the dengue pat­tern re­mained sim­i­lar to last year, al­beit with lower num­bers seen.</p>
    <p>He added that the trend was the same each year – it hap­pened al­ways at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>“The fig­ures will go all the way up un­til early next year up to around April be­fore it dips again.</p>
    <p>“The pat­tern re­mains sim­i­lar re­gard­less of the Covid-19 pan­demic or the move­ment con­trol or­der,” said Prof Sazaly in an in­ter­view on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Based on Health Min­istry data be­tween Nov 1 and Nov 7, Se­lan­gor recorded the high­est num­ber of cases with 440 re­ported, bring­ing the to­tal cases in the state to 41,619 with 36 deaths.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures are lower com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, which had 62,009 cases and 50 deaths.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the same week last year, Malaysia recorded 999 dengue cases.</p>
    <p>Cu­mu­la­tive ly, Malaysia recorded 83,752 dengue cases with 134 deaths from Jan­uary to Nov 7, com­pared with 112,345 cases and 158 deaths in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>“The slightly lower fig­ures this year are ex­pected be­cause dengue of­ten re­curs in places where it has hap­pened be­fore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Sazaly said the in­ten­sity was not too high this time round as some peo­ple who were in­fected de­vel­oped im­mu­nity, adding that they would not get in­fected if the virus was of the same strain.</p>
    <p>“Hot spots are al­ways sim­i­lar due to high pop­u­la­tion den­sity in the house or com­mu­nity, and the same be­hav­iour of res­i­dents when it comes to their en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“This in­cludes un­changed habits of lit­ter­ing, walk­ing in the park in the evening and not us­ing mosquito re­pel­lent,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to Covid-19, he said, dengue was trans­mit­table dur­ing the in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“When you are hav­ing dengue fever, there is a very high amount of virus in the blood. When the mosquito bites you and sucks your blood, it trans­fers the virus when bit­ing an­other per­son.”</p>
    <p>Al­though dengue does not spread as fast as Covid-19, the in­fec­tions do come around, he said, adding that dengue pa­tients with the fever could be trans­mit­ting it un­know­ingly.</p>
    <p>To stop con­tract­ing dengue, he said, the use of mosquito re­pel­lent is vi­tal, es­pe­cially at hot spots.</p>
    <p>Dengue cases have been on the rise since Oct 25, es­pe­cially in densely pop­u­lated states.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor has the sec­ond high­est num­ber of cases af­ter Se­lan­gor, with 193 new cases be­tween Nov 1 and Nov 7 and 156 dengue cases in the pre­vi­ous week.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor has so far recorded 10,508 cases and 39 deaths. Both fig­ures are higher than last year’s to­tal num­bers of 9,491 cases and 25 deaths.</p>
