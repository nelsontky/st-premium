    <p>Given the health haz­ard posed by smok­ing and the peer pres­sure on youth to “act cool”, de­ter­rent ac­tion, like the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment’s move to raise the min­i­mum age for the pur­chase of cig­a­rettes, has been im­ple­mented by coun­tries around the globe.</p>
    <p>On Jan 1 this year, the Repub­lic raised the min­i­mum age for smok­ing to 21, from 20.</p>
    <p>In the United States, fed­eral law set the min­i­mum age at 21 on Dec 20, 2019, up from 18, af­ter leg­is­la­tion was passed.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, the min­i­mum age is 20, and in the Philip­pines it is 18.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, the le­gal age was raised from 18 in 2017.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, how­ever, de­spite calls to raise the le­gal age, a strong to­bacco lobby has con­vinced politi­cians to main­tain the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>Malaysia and Aus­tralia have kept the min­i­mum age at 18, while it is 20 in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>A pro­posal by the Min­istry of Health to raise the smok­ing age in Malaysia to 21 ap­pears to have been qui­etly shelved, while cam­paigns to set a higher age bar­rier in Aus­tralia have not been able to con­vince politi­cians.</p>
    <p>China, which is estimated to con­sume 40 per cent of the world’s cig­a­rettes, has also set the age at 18.</p>
    <p>An estimated 100 mil­lion peo­ple died from smok­ing in the 20th cen­tury – most of them in high-in­come coun­tries – and es­ti­mates sug­gest that one bil­lion peo­ple could per­ish in the cur­rent cen­tury, the bulk in low- to mid­dle-in­come coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Around one in five adults around the world is a smoker and, glob­ally, 15 per cent of deaths are at­trib­uted to the habit.</p>
    <p>The se­cond-hand smoke ex­haled by smok­ers also kills, with the Global Bur­den of Dis­ease study pub­lished in the Lancet med­i­cal jour­nal in­di­cat­ing that while seven mil­lion peo­ple died due to smok­ing in 2017, another 1.2 mil­lion per­ished from toxic se­cond-hand fumes.</p>
    <p>The good news is that death rates from smok­ing have fallen.</p>
    <p>A de­cline was seen from 146 per 100,000 peo­ple in 1990 to 90 per 100,000 in 2017.</p>
    <p>The trend was seen world­wide, as more peo­ple avoided the vice, with bet­ter public aware­ness and more health con­scious­ness.</p>
    <p>Poli­cies aimed at in­creas­ing the min­i­mum age for smok­ing are grounded in strong sci­en­tific ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies show that nearly 90 per cent of adults who smoke on a daily ba­sis had their first cig­a­rette by 18 years of age, and the tran­si­tion from to­bacco ex­per­i­men­ta­tion to reg­u­lar use typ­i­cally oc­curs dur­ing young adult­hood.</p>
    <p>Young adults are also seen as the pri­mary role model for teens.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal­is­ing on this, the to­bacco in­dus­try heav­ily mar­kets its prod­ucts to young adults.</p>
    <p>Poli­cies to limit younger peo­ple’s ac­cess there­fore help to pre­vent ex­per­i­men­ta­tion with to­bacco from be­com­ing an ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>But moves to raise the min­i­mum age for smok­ing of­ten at­tract vo­cal op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>One ar­gu­ment is that do­ing so will ad­versely af­fect small busi­nesses. Another com­plaint is that it will be dif­fi­cult to en­force.</p>
    <p>To­bacco firms seem to have a ma­jor role in the re­cal­ci­trant stance, pump­ing money into stud­ies re­ject­ing the link be­tween smok­ing and cancer as well as heart dis­ease, and lob­by­ing to en­sure that their busi</p>
    <p>nesses con­tinue to thrive.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, pol­i­cy­mak­ers have re­sorted to pro­gres­sively higher tax­a­tion and bans on smok­ing in public, in ad­di­tion to in­creased age re­quire­ments, to curb the dan­ger­ous habit.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say pre­vent­ing smok­ers from in­dulging in public is more likely to make them try to quit.</p>
    <p>But coun­tries like the US, where law­mak­ers were will­ing to sign up to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion Frame­work Con­ven­tion on To­bacco Con­trol (FCTC), have not all been will­ing to rat­ify the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries did not sign up to the FCTC, recog­nis­ing the tax rev­enue com­ing into govern­ment cof­fers from cig­a­rette ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Con­sci­en­tious ob­jec­tors have noted that in coun­tries such as Aus­tralia and Pak­istan, leg­is­la­tion at sub-na­tional or state lev­els is of­ten far more strin­gent than at the fed­eral stage.</p>
    <p>Na­tional-level re­stric­tions ex­ist in some coun­tries, such as Turkey.</p>
    <p>Perti­nently, one study of bar­tenders ob­served prompt im­prove­ments in lung func­tion af­ter in­door smok­ing bans were en­acted.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, more and more law­mak­ers have now taken cog­ni­sance of the stark re­al­ity that smok­ing kills, with youth par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble, and are im­ple­ment­ing new poli­cies to en­cour­age peo­ple to kick the butt.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies show that nearly 90 per cent of adults who smoke on a daily ba­sis had their first cig­a­rette by 18 years of age and the tran­si­tion from to­bacco ex­per­i­men­ta­tion to reg­u­lar use typ­i­cally oc­curs dur­ing young adult­hood.</p>
