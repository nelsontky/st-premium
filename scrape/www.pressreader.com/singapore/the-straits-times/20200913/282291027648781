    <p>The 162ha Bukit Brown ceme­tery, which was closed in 1973, is the fi­nal rest­ing place for some of Sin­ga­pore’s ear­li­est pioneers. Some fam­i­lies have come to the ceme­tery at night to place of­fer­ings for the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val from Aug 19 to Wednesday.</p>
    <p>But Bukit Brown is es­pe­cially ac­tive dur­ing the Qing Ming pe­riod, when Chi­nese fam­i­lies visit to make of­fer­ings dur­ing the Tomb Sweep­ing Fes­ti­val, which falls ev­ery year in April.</p>
    <p>Since late March, her­itage ac­tivists and a com­mu­nity of vol­un­teers, called the Bukit Brown­ies, have had to stop their na­ture and his­tor­i­cal walks due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. They have con­ducted th­ese walks free of charge since 2011.</p>
    <p>Broth­ers Ray­mond and Charles Goh – dubbed Sin­ga­pore’s “tomb hunters” – met me at Bukit Brown ceme­tery on a rainy Satur­day morn­ing last week­end for an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“We hope to re­sume our na­ture and her­itage walks in Bukit Brown soon, but with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place,” says Mr Ray­mond Goh, 56, a phar­ma­cist.</p>
    <p>The Gohs are li­censed tourist guides with the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) and are al­lowed to con­duct com­mer­cial tours and free walks.</p>
    <p>But to con­tinue with th­ese dur­ing Covid-19, they need to sub­mit an ap­pli­ca­tion to STB and re­ceive ap­proval from the Min­istry of Trade and Industry.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to STB, tour oper­a­tors and tourist guides that have re­ceived ap­proval to re­sume tour op­er­a­tions can con­duct walk­ing tours for up to 10 peo­ple, with a max­i­mum of five peo­ple al­lowed in any one sub-group.</p>
    <p>The free her­itage ses­sions in the ceme­tery con­ducted by the Gohs and the Brown­ies have at­tracted quite a fol­low­ing.</p>
    <p>Since 2011, they have com­pleted 862 walks, dur­ing which more than 22,000 peo­ple learnt more about the his­tory, her­itage and habi­tats of the ceme­tery com­plex, which sits at the end of Lorong Halwa, just off Lornie High­way.</p>
    <p>What makes Bukit Brown spe­cial is that many of its more than 100,000 tomb stones are well-pre­served ex­am­ples of Chi­nese grave ar­chi­tec­ture, a tes­ta­ment to the high stan­dards of Chi­nese stone­ma­sonry found on the spe­cially im­ported stones.</p>
    <p>Some are buried deep i n the jun­gle area of the site, also known as Greater Bukit Brown.</p>
    <p>This part of the ceme­tery hides tombs that are mostly over­grown with sinewy creep­ers, weeds and bushes as well as fallen trees and as­sorted creepy crawlies – as I found out dur­ing my tour.</p>
    <p>The Gohs have doc­u­mented more than 10,000 tombs in their archives. Some are fea­tured in the on­line re­source All Things Bukit Brown (buk­it­brown.com), which was started in 2012 by the Brown­ies.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond Goh also main­tains a blog (tombs.buk­it­brown.org) to dis­cuss graves and graven images of his­tor­i­cal im­por­tance.</p>
    <p>While he has a pho­to­graphic mem­ory of tomb­stones and the lo­ca­tions of tombs through­out Sin­ga­pore, his 53-year-old brother, Mr Charles Goh, who is head of the safety de­part­ment at a con­struc­tion com­pany, spe­cialises in land re­search.</p>
    <p>The broth­ers pay out of their pock­ets for re­search ser­vices such as get­ting land in­for­ma­tion from sources in­clud­ing the Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity, Na­tional Li­brary Board and Na­tional Archives of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the help of the Brown­ies, the Gohs reg­u­larly clear path­ways in the ceme­tery and clean tombs so the sites of in­ter­est are kept ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>If the tombs are his­tor­i­cal and fully cov­ered by veg­e­ta­tion and over­growth, the broth­ers will dig into their pock­ets to hire tomb keep­ers to clear the veg­e­ta­tion, so as to study the epi­taphs bet­ter,</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Lim, di­rec­tor of travel agent and tourist guides at STB, says: “STB wel­comes in­no­va­tive tour con­cepts and ideas that will en­cour­age lo­cals and, even­tu­ally, in­ter­na­tional visi­tors to dis­cover dif­fer­ent sides of Sin­ga­pore and its hid­den gems.</p>
    <p>“Busi­nesses with in­ter­est­ing tour con­cepts can ap­ply for fund­ing sup­port through STB’s Ex­pe­ri­ence Step-Up Fund, which sup­ports the de­vel­op­ment of prod­ucts or ex­pe­ri­ences that can en­rich Sin­ga­pore’s des­ti­na­tion ex­pe­ri­ence and at­trac­tive­ness.”</p>
    <p>Bukit Brown achieved World Mon­u­ments Fund Watch List sta­tus in 2014, af­ter a group of Brown­ies and aca­demics nom­i­nated it and drew at­ten­tion to its sig­nif­i­cance as part of a global her­itage.</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial list of cul­tural her­itage sites in ur­gent need of con­ser­va­tion this year in­clude the Notre-Dame of Paris, a Catholic cathe­dral; Anarkali Bazaar in La­hore, Pak­istan; and the sa­cred val­ley of the In­cas in Peru.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­teers also con­duct in­de­pen­dent re­search and or­gan­ise pub­lic talks with Sin­ga­pore mu­se­ums, li­braries and schools</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond Goh calls Bukit Brown s a “liv­ing mu­seum” of Sin­ga­pore’s pioneers who helped the is­land develop from a Bri­tish out­post to an in­de­pen­dent na­tion.</p>
    <p>“Bukit Brown is more than just a ceme­tery. It is the last ves­tiges of Sin­ga­pore’s pre-war his­tory,” he says.</p>
    <p>“You will find the tomb of one of Sin­ga­pore’s rich­est Chi­nese men dur­ing the colo­nial era, Lim Loh, deep in the forested area.”</p>
    <p>Lim, a con­struc­tion mag­nate who com­mis­sioned Bri­tish ar­chi­tec­ture firm Swan & Ma­claren in the late 1800s to de­sign sev­eral shop­houses and res­i­dences, is the fa­ther of war hero Lim Bo Seng.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh says there are also tombs of found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew’s ma­ter­nal grand­mother Leong Ah Soon, who died on Oct 9, 1934. Born in 1881, she was 16 years younger than her hus­band, Chua Kim Teng.</p>
    <p>Other nota­bles in Bukit Brown in­clude Lee Kim Soo, an in­dus­tri­al­ist who pi­o­neered the match man­u­fac­tur­ing industry; Tan Chor Nam, a pi­o­neer in the 1911 Chi­nese Rev­o­lu­tion and ad­vo­cate for education for women in the early 1900s; as well as Lim Chong Pang, Chew Boon Lay and Chew Joo Chiat, who had neigh­bour­hoods named af­ter them.</p>
    <p>Some be­lieve Bukit Brown des­tined for big­ger things.</p>
    <p>In the opin­ion of avowed life­long Brownie Peter Pak, the site should aim higher than the World Mon­u­ments Fund Watch List.</p>
    <p>“Bukit Brown is wor­thy of be­ing a Unesco World Her­itage Site,” says the 47-year-old project man­ager.</p>
    <p>Only gov­ern­ments – not in­di­vid­u­als or groups – can nom­i­nate a site for Unesco con­sid­er­a­tion and it would need to be proven to have out­stand­ing uni­ver­sal val­ues that meet Unesco’s ex­haus­tive cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, only the Botanic Gar­dens has achieved that dis­tinc­tion – in 2015, af­ter a two-year is</p>
    <p>nom­i­na­tion process by the Na­tional Her­itage Board.</p>
    <p>Mr Pak adds: “While Bukit Brown is a Chi­nese ceme­tery, its ma­te­ri­als and arte­facts, such as the dec­o­ra­tive tiles, In­dian sentinels and Art Deco-style tombs, at­test to a unique melt­ing pot of in­flu­ences from dif­fer­ent cul­tures – un­ri­valled any­where else on the planet.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pak, who is also a mem­ber of the Na­ture So­ci­ety (Sin­ga­pore), says he has spot­ted white crested laugh­ing thrushes, thick-billed green pigeons, straw-headed bul­buls and blue-crowned hang­ing par­rots on his jaunts around the area.</p>
    <p>“I would tell those who have yet to check out Bukit Brown to throw away your ‘pan­tang’ (Malay word for ta­boo),” he says.</p>
    <p>“Treat this her­itage and na­ture space as a ‘liv­ing li­brary’ that con­tains the bi­og­ra­phy of our early pioneers and a space where you can learn about and ap­pre­ci­ate na­ture.”</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Jonathan Siew, 68, who has been help­ing the Brown­ies on their guided walks for the past few years, says Bukit Brown should be on the to-do list of young ex­plor­ers.</p>
    <p>“Young peo­ple will be hooked on this out­door mu­seum,” says Mr Siew, who also jogs there in the wee hours. He drives there from his home in Hol­land Vil­lage.</p>
    <p>“Also, they will be con­serv­ing the site for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Dr Jack Lee, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Her­itage So­ci­ety, says Bukit Brown is thought to be one of the largest Chi­nese ceme­ter­ies out­side China and one of a very small num­ber of ceme­ter­ies left in Sin­ga­pore dat­ing back to the 19th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>“We hope what re­mains of Bukit Brown ceme­tery can be kept in­tact,” he adds. “It is also a haven for wildlife and vis­ited reg­u­larly by jog­gers, horse rid­ers and his­tory en­thu­si­asts.”</p>
    <p>While doc­u­men­ta­tion in the form of pho­to­graphs and copy­ing down in­scrip­tions can be car­ried out for her­itage preser­va­tion, it is never a com­plete sub­sti­tute for the real thing, he notes.</p>
    <p>“The grave mon­u­ments con­tain much in­for­ma­tion such as ge­nealog­i­cal data, Chi­nese myths and leg­ends, the po­si­tion­ing and shape of tombs ac­cord­ing to feng shui prin­ci­ples, po­etry and sculp­tures re­fer­ring to Chi­nese clas­si­cal lit­er­a­ture, and in­sights into artis­tic styles from the carv­ings and use of tiles.”</p>
