    <p>For­tu­nately I don’t feel my age. Touch wood I’m not pick­ing up too many in­juries so it’s all about keep­ing on top of stuff like that and com­ing back as strong as I can next year.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>JAMIE VARDY, Le­ices­ter’s veteran striker.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Jamie Vardy, 33, be­came the old­est Premier League Golden Boot win­ner with 23 goals for Le­ices­ter this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The in­di­vid­ual ac­co­lade on Sun­day helped to ease the pain of the team miss­ing out on Cham­pi­ons League foot­ball de­spite 312 con­sec­u­tive days in the top four.</p>
    <p>The striker did not add to his tally in the 2-0 de­feat to Manchester United on Sun­day as the Foxes fin­ished fifth on 62 points to set­tle for a place in the Europa League.</p>
    <p>Near­est ri­vals Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang of Arse­nal and Danny Ings of Southamp­ton scored against Wat­ford and Sh­effield United re­spec­tively, but the chas­ing duo both fin­ished one goal be­hind Vardy.</p>
    <p>“It’s a won­der­ful in­di­vid­ual achieve­ment,” said Le­ices­ter man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers. “We wouldn’t be where we are with­out his qual­ity and goals. He’s a joy to work with, has a great men­tal­ity and has such qual­ity.”</p>
    <p>Vardy scored 24 goals to help Le­ices­ter win the league ti­tle in 2015-16, but missed out on the award as Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur’s Harry Kane had 25.</p>
    <p>Vardy, who turns 34 in Jan­uary, has no in­ten­tion of slow­ing down.</p>
    <p>“For­tu­nately I don’t feel my age,” the former Eng­land in­ter­na­tional told Sky Sports. “Touch wood I’m not pick­ing up too many in­juries so it’s all about keep­ing on top of stuff like that and com­ing back as strong as I can next year.”</p>
    <p>Manchester City’s Brazil­ian keeper Eder­son won the Golden Glove award af­ter record­ing his 16th clean sheet of the cam­paign in a 5-0 win against Nor­wich.</p>
    <p>The shutout saw him edge out Burn­ley’s Nick Pope (15) as his side fell 2-1 to Brighton.</p>
    <p>There was also joy for Eder­son’s team­mate Kevin de Bruyne, who equalled Thierry Henry’s Premier League record (2002-03) for most as­sists in a sin­gle sea­son.</p>
    <p>His 20th as­sist of the term was an inch-per­fect pass for Ra­heem Ster­ling to beat Tim Krul in the 79th minute to make it 3-0.</p>
    <p>The Bel­gian scored him­self just be­fore half-time and com­pleted the rout in the 90th minute as City outscored cham­pi­ons Liver­pool by 17 goals – 102 to 85.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously I know with as­sists I need my team­mates. I can cre­ate the op­por­tu­ni­ties but if they don’t score them, I don’t get any­thing,” said de Bruyne, whose pre­vi­ous best was 18 as­sists in 2016-17.</p>
    <p>“My role is to cre­ate as many chances as I can, and help the team get in front of goal – and then I am hop­ing they will fin­ish it. They do it a lot of times so I am very grate­ful for that.”</p>
