    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON A deal in­tended to ad­dress the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s con­cerns about TikTok’s ties to China was com­pli­cated by dis­agree­ment over whether an Amer­i­can firm would con­trol the so­cial me­dia app and the United States Pres­i­dent’s threat to block any agree­ment that leaves the ser­vice in the hands of a Chi­nese com­pany.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he had given his “bless­ing” to a trans­ac­tion that he said would re­sult in non-Chi­nese in­vestors, in­clud­ing Or­a­cle and Wal­mart, own­ing TikTok.</p>
    <p>But ByteDance, the Chi­nese owner of TikTok, threw cold wa­ter on that struc­ture on Sun­day, dis­put­ing both Or­a­cle and Mr Trump’s char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion of the deal. ByteDance said it would hold a ma­jor­ity share of the new com­pany un­til it went pub­lic within the next year.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle said on Mon­day that as soon as the new com­pany, TikTok Global, was cre­ated, ByteDance would lose its own­er­ship stake in the ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Asked dur­ing a tele­vi­sion ap­pear­ance on Fox & Friends on Mon­day about the po­ten­tial that ByteDance would still own 80 per cent of the ser­vice, Mr Trump said that the Chi­nese firm would “have noth­ing to do with it, and if they do, we just won’t make the deal”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said Or­a­cle would have con­trol over TikTok, adding: “If we find that they don’t have to­tal con­trol, then we’re not go­ing to ap­prove the deal.”</p>
    <p>The back-and-forth un­der­scores how fluid the trans­ac­tion re­mains and the risk that TikTok could still fail to sat­isfy the US gov­ern­ment’s na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, the Com­merce Depart­ment de­layed for one week a plan to ban TikTok from US app stores while the gov­ern­ment re­viewed the trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>If the deal does not sat­isfy Mr Trump’s con­cerns, new down­loads of TikTok could es­sen­tially be banned in the US.</p>
    <p>China could also scut­tle the deal, which has be­come the lat­est front in a larger bat­tle over whether the US or China will con­trol the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for TikTok said on Sun­day that ByteDance would hold 80 per cent of the new com­pany un­til a planned pub­lic of­fer­ing for the ser­vice took place on the US stock mar­ket in about a year.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle and Wal­mart would to­gether hold a 20 per cent stake, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>ByteDance echoed that char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion in a state­ment posted on­line in China on Sun­day, where it said that the deal did not in­volve a trans­fer of TikTok’s valu­able al­go­rithm – a de­tail that is likely to fuel the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle dis­puted part of TikTok’s de­scrip­tion of the deal.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Ken Glueck, an Or­a­cle ex­ec­u­tive, said in a state­ment that upon “cre­ation of TikTok Global, Or­a­cle/Wal­mart will make their in­vest­ment and the TikTok Global shares will be dis­trib­uted to their own­ers, Amer­i­cans will be the ma­jor­ity and ByteDance will have no own­er­ship in TikTok Global”.</p>
    <p>Un­der the terms of the pro­posed deal, ByteDance’s stake in the newly cre­ated TikTok Global would be handed out to the com­pany’s cur­rent back­ers – which in­cludes prom­i­nent Amer­i­can in­vestors.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the trans­ac­tion would even­tu­ally lead to the app be­com­ing ma­jor­ity-owned by Amer­i­can in­vestors, ac­cord­ing to a per­son with knowl­edge of the talks. It is be­lieved Mr Zhang Yim­ing, ByteDance’s founder and a ma­jor share­holder in his com­pany, would re­tain a sig­nif­i­cant stake in TikTok.</p>
    <p>The par­ties have tried to mol­lify con­cerns about con­trol by telling Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials that the changeover would hap­pen even­tu­ally, said a per­son with knowl­edge of the talks.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed deal could also meet re­sis­tance from Chi­nese of­fi­cials, who have ex­pressed con­cerns about hand­ing over to the US one of their most suc­cess­ful tech­nol­ogy ex­ports.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Hu Xi­jin, ed­i­torin-chief of the Global Times, a na­tion­al­ist tabloid con­trolled by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, posted on Twit­ter that the deal could face op­po­si­tion from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“Based on what I know, Bei­jing won’t ap­prove cur­rent agree­ment be­tween ByteDance, TikTok’s par­ent com­pany, and Or­a­cle, Wal­mart, be­cause the agree­ment would en­dan­ger China’s na­tional se­cu­rity, in­ter­ests and dig­nity,” Mr Hu wrote.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment re­leased new reg­u­la­tions last month that ap­peared to make it dif­fi­cult for TikTok to sell its core tech­nol­ogy with­out a li­cence, rais­ing the prospect Bei­jing could move to block a deal.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for TikTok said on Sun­day that ByteDance would hold 80 per cent of the new com­pany un­til a planned pub­lic of­fer­ing for the ser­vice took place on the US stock mar­ket in about a year.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle and Wal­mart would to­gether hold a 20 per cent stake, the spokesman said.</p>
