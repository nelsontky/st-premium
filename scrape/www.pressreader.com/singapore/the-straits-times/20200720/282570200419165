    <p>NEW YORK • In the heated de­bate over re­open­ing schools, one burn­ing ques­tion has been whether and how ef­fi­ciently chil­dren can spread the virus to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>A large new study from South Korea of­fers an an­swer: Chil­dren younger than age 10 trans­mit to oth­ers much less of­ten than adults do, but the risk is not zero. And those be­tween the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at least as well as adults do.</p>
    <p>The find­ings sug­gest that as schools re­open, com­mu­ni­ties will see clus­ters of in­fec­tion take root that in­clude chil­dren of all ages, sev­eral ex­perts cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>“I fear that there has been this sense that kids just won’t get in­fected or don’t get in­fected in the same way as adults and that, there­fore, they’re al­most like a bub­bled pop­u­la­tion,” said Univer­sity of Min­nesota in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert Michael Oster­holm.</p>
    <p>“There will be trans­mis­sion,” he said. “What we have to do is ac­cept that now and in­clude that in our plans.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral stud­ies from Europe and Asia have sug­gested that young chil­dren are less likely to get in­fected and to spread the virus. But most of those stud­ies were small and flawed, said Dr Ashish Jha, di­rec­tor of the Har­vard Global Health In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>The new study “is very care­fully done, it’s sys­tem­atic and looks at a very large pop­u­la­tion”, Dr Jha said. “It’s one of the best stud­ies we’ve had to date on this is­sue.”</p>
    <p>Other ex­perts also praised the scale and rigour of the anal­y­sis. South Korean re­searchers iden­ti­fied 5,706 peo­ple who were the first to re­port Covid-19 symp­toms in their house­holds be­tween Jan 20 and March 27, when schools were closed, and then traced the 59,073 con­tacts of these “in­dex cases”.</p>
    <p>They tested all of the house­hold con­tacts of each pa­tient, re­gard­less of symp­toms, but tested only symp­to­matic con­tacts out­side the house­hold.</p>
    <p>The first per­son in a house­hold to de­velop symp­toms is not nec­es­sar­ily the first to have been in­fected, and the re­searchers ac­knowl­edged this lim­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren are also less likely than adults to show symp­toms, so the study may have un­der­es­ti­mated the num­ber of chil­dren who set off the chain of trans­mis­sion within their house­holds.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a large new study from South Korea, chil­dren younger than age 10 trans­mit to oth­ers much less of­ten than adults do, but the risk is not zero. And those be­tween the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at least as well as adults do.</p>
    <p>Still, ex­perts said the ap­proach was rea­son­able. “It is also from a place with great con­tact trac­ing, done at the point in­ter­ven­tions were be­ing put in place,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Bill Han­age, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at the Har­vard T.H. Chan School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren un­der age 10 were roughly half as likely as adults to spread the virus to oth­ers, con­sis­tent with other stud­ies. That may be be­cause chil­dren gen­er­ally ex­hale less air – and there­fore less virus-laden air – or be­cause they ex­hale that air closer to the ground, mak­ing it less likely that adults would breathe it in.</p>
    <p>Even so, the num­ber of new in­fec­tions seeded by chil­dren may rise when schools re­open, the study au­thors cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>“Young chil­dren may show higher at­tack rates when the school clo­sure ends, con­tribut­ing to com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of Covid-19,” they wrote.</p>
    <p>Other stud­ies have also sug­gested that the large num­ber of con­tacts for school­child­ren, who in­ter­act with dozens of oth­ers for a good part of the day, may can­cel out their smaller risk of in­fect­ing oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers traced the con­tacts only of chil­dren who felt ill, so it is still un­clear how ef­fi­ciently asymp­to­matic chil­dren spread the virus, said Dr Caitlin Rivers, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at the Johns Hop­kins Bloomberg School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>“I think it was al­ways go­ing to be the case that symp­to­matic chil­dren are in­fec­tious,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tions about the role of chil­dren are more around whether chil­dren who don’t have symp­toms are in­fec­tious.”</p>
    <p>Dr Rivers was a mem­ber of a sci­en­tific panel that last Wed­nes­day rec­om­mended re­open­ing schools wher­ever pos­si­ble for dis­abled chil­dren and for those in ele­men­tary schools, be­cause those groups have the most trou­ble learn­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>She said the new study does not al­ter that rec­om­men­da­tion. The study is more wor­ri­some for chil­dren in mid­dle and high school. This group was even more likely to in­fect oth­ers than adults were, the study found. But some ex­perts said that find­ing may be a fluke or may stem from the chil­dren’s be­hav­iours.</p>
    <p>These older chil­dren are fre­quently as big as adults and yet may have some of the same un­hy­gienic habits as young chil­dren. They may also have been more likely than the younger chil­dren to so­cialise with their peers within the high-rise com­plexes in South Korea.</p>
    <p>“We can spec­u­late all day about this, but we just don’t know,” Dr Oster­holm said. “The bot­tom line mes­sage is, there’s go­ing to be trans­mis­sion.”</p>
