    <p>DENPASAR (Bali) • An Aus­tralian woman jailed in Bali with her Bri­tish DJ boyfriend for beat­ing a po­lice­man to death was freed yes­ter­day, af­ter nearly four years in prison on the In­done­sian is­land.</p>
    <p>Ms Sara Con­nor, 49, left Ker­obokan prison and was placed in the hands of im­mi­gra­tion au­thor­i­ties to await de­por­ta­tion, Bali of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Ms Con­nor and David Tay­lor were con­victed in 2017 of fa­tally as­sault­ing of­fi­cer Wayan Su­darsa, whose bat­tered body was found in the pop­u­lar tourist area of Kuta the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cer Su­darsa’s blood-soaked body was cov­ered with dozens of wounds to his neck, chest and head.</p>
    <p>Ms Con­nor was given early re­lease from her five-year term for good be­hav­iour, while Tay­lor is serv­ing a six-year jail sen­tence for his role in the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Tay­lor, whose stage name was DJ Nutzo, had ad­mit­ted get­ting into a fight with Mr Su­darsa on the beach af­ter ac­cus­ing the of­fi­cer of steal­ing Ms Con­nor’s hand­bag.</p>
    <p>He also ad­mit­ted hit­ting the po­lice­man with items in­clud­ing binoc­u­lars and a beer bot­tle.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Tay­lor claimed dur­ing the trial that he had feared for his life and acted in self-de­fence dur­ing the late-night brawl.</p>
    <p>Ms Con­nor, a mother of two, had main­tained her in­no­cence, in­sist­ing that she only in­ter­vened to try to break up the fight.</p>
    <p>This claim was re­jected by a Bali court, which found that she had held down the vic­tim as Tay­lor beat him.</p>
    <p>The pair fled the crime scene, but Ms Con­nor’s driv­ing li­cence and ATM card were found next to the body.</p>
    <p>Af­ter po­lice launched a mas­sive man­hunt for the cou­ple, they took refuge in the Aus­tralian con­sulate in Bali, but later handed them­selves over to the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, pros­e­cu­tors said the pair, who were tried sep­a­rately, should not be con­victed of mur­der be­cause they did not in­tend to kill the of­fi­cer.</p>
