    <p>School teacher Yu Yuan usu­ally goes on at least two an­nual hol­i­days, to places like Iran and Ja­pan, but has not been on va­ca­tion at all this year.</p>
    <p>Travel re­stric­tions aris­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic have kept her home-bound, with Madam Yu, 38, es­ti­mat­ing that she has saved nearly 20,000 yuan (S$4,000).</p>
    <p>“But most of the money I saved has gone to pay­ing for gro­ceries and en­rich­ment classes for my daugh­ter,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, with schools closed, our in­come has de­creased so we have to be more care­ful about our spend­ing since we don’t know where the econ­omy is go­ing.”</p>
    <p>Madam Yu is among a grow­ing group of mid­dle-class Chi­nese who have been tight­en­ing their purse strings in dif­fer­ent ways to brace them­selves for a loom­ing eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial fig­ures out yes­ter­day showed a 3.2 per cent growth in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP), a stun­ning recovery from a his­toric 6.8 per cent con­trac­tion last quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Yet the on­go­ing global pan­demic will re­main a key con­straint for any do­mes­tic recovery in the world’s sec­ond largest econ­omy, said Na­tional Bureau of Statis­tics spokesman Liu Ai­hua.</p>
    <p>“It is dif­fi­cult to restart the world econ­omy and trade,” she said, adding that “the recovery of do­mes­tic de­mand is re­stricted to a cer­tain ex­tent cur­rently”.</p>
    <p>That China can present pos­i­tive GDP growth mere months af­ter con­trol­ling the Covid-19 out­break is a bea­con of hope for much of the world try­ing to get back on its feet.</p>
    <p>Economists had ini­tially un­der­es­ti­mated how much net ex­ports would prop up the Chi­nese econ­omy, said OCBC Bank’s head of Greater China re­search Tommy Xie.</p>
    <p>China’s goods trade sur­plus widened to US$154.7 bil­lion (S$215.1 bil­lion) in the sec­ond quar­ter, higher than the US$104 bil­lion sur­plus recorded in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Xie said: “The stronger-than-ex­pected goods trade was mainly at­trib­ut­able to three fac­tors – strong de­mand for Chi­nese med­i­cal equip­ment dur­ing the global pan­demic, in­creas­ing trade link­age be­tween China and Asean, and still re­silient ex­port to the United States, par­tially driven by front-load­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in an­tic­i­pa­tion of a de­te­ri­o­rat­ing bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship.”</p>
    <p>Ten­sions with the US, also</p>
    <p>China’s big­gest trad­ing part­ner, have in­creased ex­po­nen­tially, with re­la­tions at an all-time low, not to men­tion the var­i­ous diplo­matic spats – which Bei­jing has a pen­chant for turn­ing into eco­nomic ones – with Aus­tralia, Bri­tain and Canada.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to global chief ex­ec­u­tives yes­ter­day, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said the fun­da­men­tals of</p>
    <p>Q2 ’20</p>
    <p>China’s long-term eco­nomic growth will not change and that the coun­try re­mains open for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing will pri­ori­tise its do­mes­tic aims, but also en­sure sta­bil­ity in employment, fi­nance, for­eign trade, for­eign in­vest­ment, do­mes­tic in­vest­ment and mar­ket ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“China will fos­ter new op­por­tu­ni­ties and cre­ate new prospects for Chi­nese and for­eign en­ter­prises,” the of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency re­ported Pres­i­dent Xi as say­ing, adding that those CEOs have made the right choice to stay rooted in China.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially, the mes­sage is: China is still open for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>While much of China’s re­bound has been driven by fac­tory out­put and ex­ports, Bei­jing is look­ing to more in­fra­struc­ture con­struc­tion and do­mes­tic con­sump­tion to buoy an econ­omy that was dealt a body blow by the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Re­tail fig­ures, how­ever, have seen a steady de­crease as con­sumers avoid phys­i­cal shops, while cit­i­zens anx­ious about their fu­ture in­come have also been more con­ser­va­tive in their spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Sales were down 1.8 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter in spite of the is­suance of nearly US$3 bil­lion worth of con­sump­tion vouch­ers by the gov­ern­ment. But economists say vouch­ers and coupons are in­ef­fec­tive in off­set­ting the loss of in­come for those un­able to work dur­ing the out­break or who have lost their jobs.</p>
    <p>But this is not to say that re­tail is strug­gling, said Pek­ing Univer­sity eco­nom­ics pro­fes­sor Cao Heping.</p>
    <p>He noted that dur­ing the out­break, sales and ser­vices largely moved on­line, which are not fully re­flected in of­fi­cial fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Con­sump­tion propen­sity is likely to con­tinue through­out the year be­cause of “com­pli­men­tary over­time con­sump­tion”.</p>
    <p>“It’s like you wanted to go on a hol­i­day ear­lier this year, but you couldn’t be­cause of the virus, and now that things are im­prov­ing, the money has been set aside so you’d still find a chance to go,” he said, adding that there are likely to be spikes in do­mes­tic spend­ing around the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“There has been a short-term im­pact on con­sumer be­hav­iour, for sure, but in the long term, there is no change at all.”</p>
    <p>But ul­ti­mately, with the rest of the world still strug­gling to restart their economies, much less re­sum­ing pur­chas­ing, how sus­tain­able is this for China’s ex­port-de­pen­dent econ­omy?</p>
    <p>Mr Julian Evans-Pritchard, se­nior China econ­o­mist at Cap­i­tal Eco­nom­ics, said: “The recovery will in­evitably slow down dur­ing the sec­ond half of the year now that the ini­tial boost from re­open­ing has passed.”</p>
    <p>He added: “But with the labour mar­ket rapidly tight­en­ing, con­sumer con­fi­dence re­turn­ing and fis­cal stim­u­lus still be­ing ramped up, we think GDP will re­turn to its pre-virus trend by the end of the year, faster than in any other ma­jor econ­omy.”</p>
