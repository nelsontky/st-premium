    <p>Sengkang GRC is a rel­a­tively young es­tate. In fu­ture, when new es­tates such as those in Bi­dadari, the South­ern wa­ter­front, Ten­gah and Tampines North are fully de­vel­oped, they will at­tract younger vot­ers to move in and set up home.</p>
    <p>Hence, the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) must fo­cus more on these young vot­ers while not ne­glect­ing the older gen­er­a­tion. The next and sub­se­quent gen­eral elec­tions will be tough as more from the Pi­o­neer and Merdeka gen­er­a­tions – tra­di­tion­ally more sup­port­ive of the PAP – are gone. The younger gen­er­a­tion is dif­fer­ent and un­like the older die-hard sup­port­ers of the PAP.</p>
    <p>The 4G and even 5G lead­ers should start im­me­di­ately to re­build the trust of vot­ers, es­pe­cially the young. The needs and as­pi­ra­tions of younger vot­ers go be­yond just bread-and-but­ter is­sues.</p>
    <p>When young peo­ple be­come en­gaged po­lit­i­cally, they want to take on greater re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and make their voices heard. In the process, they gain a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of who they are and what they value in life. They be­lieve they can har­ness their unique abil­i­ties to make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Many young peo­ple who are not old enough to vote are none­the­less ac­tive in ex­press­ing their views and fol­low pol­i­tics in some way, as demon­strated on so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Their out­look could evolve de­pend­ing on chang­ing na­tional con­di­tions and poli­cies, world events, tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions and so on.</p>
    <p>The PAP lead­ers need to think and work fast if they wish to en­gage youth and win their votes.</p>
    <p>When young peo­ple be­come en­gaged po­lit­i­cally, they want to take on greater re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and make their voices heard.
