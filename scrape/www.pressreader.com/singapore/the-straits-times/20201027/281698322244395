    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • De­spite the po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty faced by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, Malaysia said yes­ter­day that it will host the first-ever vir­tual sum­mit of lead­ers from the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) na­tions next month.</p>
    <p>Doubts had arisen ear­lier in the year if the sum­mit would go ahead due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>New Zealand, which is host­ing next year’s Apec sum­mit, has said that it will use vir­tual plat­forms to con­duct the meet­ing due to travel re­stric­tions and un­cer­tainty caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din had faced calls to re­sign as doubts swirled over the sup­port he com­mands, af­ter Malaysia’s King re­jected his re­quest to de­clare a state of emer­gency. But early to­day, Umno in­di­cated that it would con­tinue to sup­port his Perikatan Na­sional coali­tion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the In­ter­na­tional Trade and In­dus­try Min­istry said Mr Muhyid­din will chair on Nov 20 the Eco­nomic Lead­ers’ Meet­ing which will have the par­tic­i­pa­tion of all 21 Apec eco­nomic lead­ers.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia is mak­ing his­tory by trans­form­ing Apec’s usual ways of do­ing busi­ness and con­ven­ing a ma­jor­ity of Apec meet­ings in a fully vir­tual for­mat,” it said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia, which will be host­ing Apec for the sec­ond time, said the sum­mit is ex­pected to launch the re­gion’s Post-2020 Vi­sion, the key pol­icy set to re­place the “Bo­gor Goals” which will reach ma­tu­rity at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>The “Bo­gor Goals”, adopted at the 1994 Apec sum­mit in Bo­gor, In­done­sia, called for all Apec economies to achieve free and open trade and in­vest­ment by 2020.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is fac­ing a third wave of the coron­avirus out­break. It re­ported a record 1,240 new coron­avirus cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber to 27,805.</p>
