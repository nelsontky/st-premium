    <p>Lawyer M. Ravi has said the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers’ (AGC) de­mand for an apol­ogy was “plainly with­out ba­sis”, and sought an apol­ogy from the pub­lic prose­cu­tor to his client Gobi Ave­dian in­stead.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to Deputy At­tor­neyGen­eral Hri Ku­mar Nair on Wed­nes­day, Mr Ravi said he did not deny mak­ing the state­ments spec­i­fied in the AGC’s let­ter to him on Tues­day. But he de­nied the state­ments amounted to al­le­ga­tions that the pub­lic prose­cu­tor had acted in bad faith or ma­li­ciously in prose­cut­ing Gobi, and that he had made the state­ments while know­ing or hav­ing rea­son to be­lieve they were false.</p>
    <p>He also dis­agreed that he had breached any rules by mak­ing his state­ments or that his con­duct was im­proper. “We say so as there are suf­fi­cient bases for the state­ments to be made, both ob­jec­tive and sub­jec­tive,” he said in his let­ter.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, he had told al­ter­na­tive news web­site The On­line Cit­i­zen (TOC) that the prose­cu­tor had been “overzeal­ous” in prose­cut­ing Gobi, which had “led to the death sen­tence” for his client.</p>
    <p>This came after the five-judge Court of Ap­peal re­versed a 2018 de­ci­sion to con­vict Gobi on a cap­i­tal charge for drug traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi also said, among other things, the apex court’s judg­ment calls into ques­tion “the fair­ness of the ad­min­is­tra­tion of jus­tice in Gobi’s case by the pros­e­cu­tion”.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the AGC is­sued a let­ter to him de­mand­ing he apol­o­gise for his com­ments and re­tract them un­con­di­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>The AGC noted, among other things, that the Court of Ap­peal made no ad­verse find­ings against the pub­lic prose­cu­tor or the pros­e­cu­tion of Gobi. “In fact, the Court of Ap­peal pointed out in the judg­ment that the ini­tial de­ci­sion to con­vict the ap­pli­cant was ‘cor­rect at the time (it was) made’ and that none of the ar­gu­ments con­sid­ered in the judg­ment ‘could have been made in view of the le­gal position as it was un­der­stood then’.”</p>
    <p>But Mr Ravi coun­tered on Wed­nes­day that the AGC had quoted the apex court’s judg­ment out of con­text. He ar­gued the phrase “even if” in the judg­ment should be un­der­stood to mean “whether or not”.</p>
    <p>“When read in this light, it is abun­dantly clear the Court of Ap­peal did not say that its de­ci­sion in (the case) was cor­rectly de­cided at the ma­te­rial time.</p>
    <p>“In­deed, and with the ut­most re­spect, it would have been in­ap­pro­pri­ate for the Court of Ap­peal to be jus­ti­fy­ing its ear­lier de­ci­sion ex post facto in (the re­view of the case), as that would have the ef­fect of un­der­min­ing pub­lic con­fi­dence in the ad­min­is­tra­tion of jus­tice, ” he said.</p>
    <p>The AGC, he added, should have been the party fil­ing the re­view after an ear­lier case in­volv­ing Nige­rian Adili Chibuike Ejike, who had sim­i­larly es­caped the gal­lows after he was cleared of drug im­por­ta­tion charges last year.</p>
    <p>The fact that it did not do so and went on to ac­cuse him of abus­ing the court’s process when he filed the re­view lends sup­port to his ar­gu­ment that the pros­e­cu­tion had been “overzeal­ous” in de­fend­ing Gobi’s con­vic­tion on the cap­i­tal charge, Mr Ravi said.</p>
