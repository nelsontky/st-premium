    <p>All three of Sin­ga­pore’s big banks are mak­ing ef­forts to help small and mi­cro busi­nesses hit hard by the Covid-19 pan­demic se­cure much-needed fund­ing.</p>
    <p>Since March, South-east Asia’s largest bank, DBS, has ap­proved nearly 10,000 loans to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), it said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of these, more than 5,000 loans to­talling over $800 mil­lion went to mi­cro en­ter­prises. Most of these loans were col­lat­eral-free.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Su Shan, DBS’ group head of in­sti­tu­tional bank­ing, told The Straits Times on Tues­day that the bank es­ti­mates there is un­met fund­ing of $1.2 bil­lion to $3.2 bil­lion for mi­cro en­ter­prises or busi­nesses with an an­nual rev­enue of up to $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>A study pub­lished last year by Validus Cap­i­tal found that SMEs in Sin­ga­pore face a fi­nanc­ing gap of $20 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said: “While some mi­cro en­ter­prises may have flown un­der the radar, we are proac­tively reach­ing out to these busi­nesses now. For us, these smaller com­pa­nies would be bet­ter served dig­i­tally, end to end.”</p>
    <p>Half of the loans given to mi­cro en­ter­prises since March were for cus­tomers who had no prior bor­row­ing re­la­tion­ship with DBS.</p>
    <p>The bank has more than 40,000 mi­cro en­ter­prise cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>DBS this year launched a col­lat­eral-free dig­i­tal busi­ness loan of up to $200,000, to be dis­bursed within one work­ing day, with no fi­nan­cial state­ments needed in the ap­pli­ca­tion process.</p>
    <p>Ms Joyce Tee, DBS’ group head of SME bank­ing, said mi­cro en­ter­prises may not be fa­mil­iar with the sup­port avail­able to them, even though many have vi­able busi­ness mod­els and the po­ten­tial to grow.</p>
    <p>“That is why we have gone out of our way to en­sure mi­cro en­ter­prises are well sup­ported to weather the eco­nomic storm, and we are heart­ened that many busi­nesses we sup­ported through the early days of Covid-19 are be­gin­ning to see the green shoots of re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides loans, DBS is in­ten­si­fy­ing ef­forts to help com­pa­nies im­prove their over­all busi­ness op­er­a­tions, said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>Plans in the pipe­line in­clude a dig­i­tal pro­cure­ment hub that will link buy­ers and sup­pli­ers who have com­ple­men­tary needs.</p>
    <p>“It’s about help­ing them to grow their top line with rel­e­vant data, re­duce trans­ac­tion costs, and putting them on trade plat­forms to find their sup­ply chain and get them paid on time.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tan added that the bank has mined and pro­grammed its data trove to give busi­nesses per­son­alised ad­vice. For ex­am­ple, it uses ma­chine learn­ing to send con­tex­tu­alised alerts to firms on plat­forms such as cor­po­rate bank­ing por­tal DBS Ideal, to ad­vise them on how they can man­age in­ter­est rate and for­eign ex­change risks in re­sponse to real-time de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>More help is also on the way for spe­cific sec­tors. In March, DBS launched a food and bev­er­age dig­i­tal re­lief pack­age that en­ables busi­nesses to set up an on­line food-or­der­ing site in just three busi­ness days. It plans to roll out a sim­i­lar pack­age for SMEs in re­tail and tourism.</p>
    <p>The moves by DBS are part of its broader plan to en­hance its dig­i­tal ser­vices amid greater com­pe­ti­tion from non-bank play­ers that will soon be is­sued li­cences to do so.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, OCBC Bank has made a to­tal of over $1 bil­lion in col­lat­eral-free loans to 6,000 mi­cro and small busi­nesses. Half of these went to cus­tomers who did not have bor­row­ing fa­cil­i­ties with the bank.</p>
    <p>Mr Li­nus Goh, OCBC’s head of global com­mer­cial bank­ing, said: “In the sec­ond half of this year, we have ob­served some early signs of green shoots in cer­tain in­dus­tries and busi­nesses, with a grow­ing in­ter­est in new loans to sup­port these op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) has dis­bursed more than $1.3 bil­lion in col­lat­eral-free loans to small and mi­cro busi­nesses since March.</p>
    <p>Mr Lawrence Loh, UOB’s head of group busi­ness bank­ing, said the bank has dig­i­talised the en­tire loan ap­pli­ca­tion process for small busi­ness cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>He added that through UOB’s tie-ups with ecosys­tem part­ners, small busi­nesses can ap­ply for loans based on data re­lat­ing to their on­line sales per­for­mance and day-to-day op­er­a­tions, with­out the need to sub­mit fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>REACH­ING OUT</p>
    <p>While some mi­cro en­ter­prises may have flown un­der the radar, we are proac­tively reach­ing out to these busi­nesses now. For us, these smaller com­pa­nies would be bet­ter served dig­i­tally, end to end.</p>
