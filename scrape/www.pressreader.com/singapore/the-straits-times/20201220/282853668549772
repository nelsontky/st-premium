    <p>• For the Olympics, adding break­danc­ing to the com­pe­ti­tion ros­ter is a chore­ographed move to get more young peo­ple in­volved in sports.</p>
    <p>Break­danc­ing, of­fi­cially known in sport terms as “break­ing”, ap­peared at the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, in the form of head-to-head “bat­tles”.</p>
    <p>It cleared its fi­nal hur­dle to fea­ture in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games l ast week, bring­ing the wholly orig­i­nal, elec­tric art form to sport’s big­gest stage.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) pres­i­dent Thomas Bach be­lieves that its in­tro­duc­tion is “one of the re­sults of the Olympic Agenda 2020”.</p>
    <p>“We had a clear pri­or­ity to in­tro­duce sports (that are) par­tic­u­larly pop­u­lar among the younger gen­er­a­tion and tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion the ur­ban­i­sa­tion of sport,” he said.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­ered one of the pil­lars of hip-hop cul­ture, break­ing orig­i­nated in New York in the 1970s and has spread glob­ally, en­joy­ing enor­mous pop­u­lar­ity be­yond the United States.</p>
    <p>A 2019 Olympic Pro­gramme Com­mis­sion Re­port es­ti­mated there were roughly one mil­lion par­tic­i­pants in break­ing world­wide and the 2019 Red Bull BC One World Fi­nal in Mum­bai racked up more than 50 mil­lion views across on­line stream­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“It can res­onate with a lot of peo­ple be­cause hip-hop cul­ture res­onates with a lot of peo­ple,” said Lo­gan Edra, a 17-year-old Amer­i­can dancer who goes by the per­for­mance name Lo­gistx and who as­pires to win Olympic gold.</p>
    <p>“It be­ing i n the Olympics, it makes sense that peo­ple would re­fer to it as (a sport) but I think one thing for the break­ing com­mu­nity is we want to make sure that it’s not known as just a sport but an art, a sport, a cul­ture.”</p>
    <p>Richard “Crazy Legs” Colon, one of the pioneers dur­ing his up­bring­ing in the Bronx in the 1970s, said he ap­plauded break­ing’s in­clu­sion in the Olympics – which in­evitably would give more ex­po­sure to the sport – but wanted to en­sure its cul­tural core re­mained in­tact.</p>
    <p>“This is true folk art from the mu­sic to the dance, to the DJ to the rap­per,” said Colon, who ap­peared in dance films of the 1980s in­clud­ing Beat Street and Flash­dance.</p>
    <p>“We’ve al­ready le­git­imised our­selves so we’re not look­ing to the Olympics for le­git­i­macy.”</p>
    <p>Key el­e­ments in break­ing in­clude top rocks – typ­i­cally a com­peti­tor’s in­tro­duc­tory dance moves – foot­work, power moves and freezes. Power moves are ex­plo­sive dis­plays such as spins, while freezes are when a per­former sticks a pose.</p>
    <p>In a blend of artistry and ath­leti­cism, com­peti­tors are eval­u­ated not only on tech­ni­cal skill but also cre­ativ­ity and style, with strength, speed, rhythm and agility pro­vid­ing an edge.</p>
    <p>Paris Games chief Tony Es­tanguet said that or­gan­is­ers had been on the hunt for new sports to broaden the ap­peal of the Olympics and were drawn to break­ing’s po­ten­tial to at­tract a younger fan base and grow the Olympic au­di­ence in the In­ter­net age.</p>
    <p>He added that though the de­ci­sion had come in for some crit­i­cism, most of the feed­back he had re­ceived had been over­whelm­ingly pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>He said: “It’s a sport that is widely watched on all dig­i­tal plat­forms, widely con­sumed by young peo­ple... we are re­ally adding events that come from a com­pletely dif­fer­ent world, with fans, who would not nec­es­sar­ily be con­nected to the Olympic Games oth­er­wise.”</p>
