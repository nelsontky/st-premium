    <p>• Flare-ups from Aus­tralia to Ja­pan show the world has not learnt an early les­son from the coron­avirus cri­sis: to stop the spread, those with mild or symp­tom-free coron­avirus in­fec­tions must be forced to iso­late, both from their com­mu­ni­ties and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, where Vic­to­ria state has been re­port­ing record deaths, some 3,000 checks last month on peo­ple who should have been iso­lat­ing at home found 800 were out and about. In Ja­pan, where the virus has roared back, peo­ple are stay­ing home but are not in iso­la­tion: 40 per cent of el­derly pa­tients are get­ting sick from fam­ily mem­bers in the same apart­ments.</p>
    <p>The fail­ure to ef­fec­tively man­age con­ta­gious peo­ple with mild or no symp­toms is a driv­ing fac­tor be­hind some of the world’s worst resur­gences.</p>
    <p>But lessons from Italy, South Korea and oth­ers that have suc­cess­fully con­tained large-scale out­breaks show that there is a triedand-tested ap­proach to cut­ting off trans­mis­sion: move them out of their homes into cen­tralised fa­cil­i­ties while they get over their in­fec­tions, which usu­ally does not re­quire longer than a few weeks.</p>
    <p>“A lais­sez-faire ap­proach naively trust­ing ev­ery­one to be re­spon­si­ble has been shown to be in­ef­fec­tive, as there will al­ways be a pro­por­tion who will breach the terms of the iso­la­tion,” said Dr Jeremy Lim, ad­junct pro­fes­sor at the National Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>Faced with a new clus­ter this week after 102 days with­out a lo­cally trans­mit­ted case, New Zealand has quickly en­acted this strat­egy, plac­ing around 30 peo­ple – in­clud­ing at least two chil­dren be­low the age of 10 – into cen­tralised quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>But other coun­tries fac­ing a sus­tained spread, like Aus­tralia and the United States, are not broadly en­act­ing the pol­icy de­spite its proven track record. Their un­will­ing­ness – or in­abil­ity – to do so un­der­scores the chal­lenges faced by lib­eral democ­ra­cies whose pop­u­la­tions are less likely to tol­er­ate mea­sures that re­quire in­di­vid­ual sac­ri­fice for the greater good.</p>
    <p>The ex­is­tence of a large group of car­ri­ers who hardly feel sick is a unique fea­ture of the coron­avirus cri­sis, and a ma­jor fac­tor that has driven its rapid spread across the globe. Un­like in pre­vi­ous out­breaks like the 2003 Sars epi­demic, many in­fected peo­ple do not feel ill enough to stay home, and so spread the pathogen widely as they go about their daily lives.</p>
    <p>The US Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion has es­ti­mated that 40 per cent of Covid-19 in­fec­tions are asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>In Wuhan, the Chi­nese city where the coron­avirus first emerged last year, mildly sick pa­tients were orig­i­nally turned away from hos­pi­tals and told to rest at home, given that the over­whelmed health­care sys­tem needed to tend to the most se­vere cases.</p>
    <p>But health ex­perts soon found that these peo­ple would in­fect their fam­ily mem­bers and oth­ers as they moved around in the com­mu­nity, pre­cip­i­tat­ing a del­uge of cases.</p>
    <p>Bring­ing mild or asymp­to­matic pa­tients to des­ig­nated fa­cil­i­ties – re-pur­posed con­ven­tion cen­tres, ho­tels and sta­di­ums – for ba­sic med­i­cal care marked a turn­ing point in the city’s fight against the coron­avirus. Sim­ply sep­a­rat­ing them from healthy peo­ple halted the pathogen’s si­lent spread through the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy has since been used in Italy, Sin­ga­pore and South Korea at the height of their own coron­avirus out­breaks ear­lier this year. Faced with a resur­gence last month, Hong Kong con­verted an ex­hi­bi­tion cen­tre to ac­com­mo­date mild Covid-19 pa­tients and is build­ing more such fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In New Zealand, the gov­ern­ment put “a lot of thought” into en­act­ing the pol­icy, and is ask­ing fam­ily mem­bers of con­firmed cases to go into cen­tralised quar­an­tine with them if they re­quire care, said di­rec­tor-gen­eral of health Ashley Bloom­field.</p>
    <p>The ap­proach is ef­fec­tive first be­cause it pre­vents peo­ple from in­fect­ing fam­ily mem­bers in the same house­hold – over 80 per cent of clus­ter in­fec­tions in cities in China were in house­holds after pa­tients with mild symp­toms were al­lowed to stay home, said a Lancet study.</p>
    <p>Be­yond house­hold spread, the strat­egy is ne­ces­si­tated by a facet of hu­man na­ture: left to their own de­vices, some peo­ple just will not fol­low the rules.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia and Ja­pan, in­fected peo­ple who have been told to stay home have gone out for a va­ri­ety of rea­sons.</p>
    <p>“It is far bet­ter to be more ag­gres­sive in the short term with even mild cases than it is to al­low such cases to slip un­der the radar,” said Dr Ni­cholas Thomas, as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor in health se­cu­rity at the City Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
