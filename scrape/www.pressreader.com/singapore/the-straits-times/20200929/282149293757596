    <p>Mr Si­mon Quek Hong Kiat was hop­ing to ex­pand his firm’s busi­ness to China this year, but the Covid-19 pan­demic scup­pered his plans.</p>
    <p>“Travel re­stric­tions have stopped me from meet­ing po­ten­tial cus­tomers di­rectly,” said the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of QSS, which sells safety prod­ucts such as per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>A cross-bor­der trade plat­form called OneSME, how­ever, is set to put him back on the path to ex­pand­ing into the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>At the launch of OneSME yes­ter­day, Mr Quek noted that it will al­low his firm ac­cess to a buyer base of four mil­lion small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in China that are on OneCon­nect Fi­nan­cial Tech­nol­ogy’s YiQiYe plat­form.</p>
    <p>Mr Quek’s com­pany is one of 50 Sin­ga­pore firms on board OneSME as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>OneCon­nect chief ex­ec­u­tive for South-east Asia Tan Bin Ru ex­pects 100 Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies to be on OneSME by the year end.</p>
    <p>OneSME is de­vel­oped and op­er­ated by OneCon­nect, whose par­ent com­pany is China’s in­sur­ance gi­ant Ping An Group.</p>
    <p>“We are slow to ramp it up... We want to take time to ramp it up be­cause it is im­por­tant to find the cor­rect value,” Ms Tan said, re­fer­ring to ways that OneSME can bet­ter serve buyers and sell­ers.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey of 2,100 Chi­nese SMEs on YiQiYe in July showed that most of them want to buy goods from Sin­ga­pore, par­tic­u­larly for items in the food and bev­er­age sec­tor and in­dus­trial equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion and Na­tional Devel­op­ment Sim Ann, who launched the plat­form, urged lo­cal SMEs that want to ex­pand into China to be part of OneSME.</p>
    <p>“To give our SMEs a head start, OneSME will proac­tively match lo­cal sell­ers... This match­ing is at no cost to both buyers and sell­ers dur­ing this ini­tial pe­riod,” she said.</p>
    <p>OneSME – an in­vest­ment by OneCon­nect and the Repub­lic’s In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity – is also part of the Sin­ga­pore-China (Shen­zhen) Smart City Ini­tia­tive, un­der which mem­o­ran­dums of un­der­stand­ing were signed in June to grant com­pa­nies and en­trepreneur­s eas­ier ac­cess to op­por­tu­ni­ties in the Greater Bay Area and South-east Asia dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) group busi­ness bank­ing head Lawrence Loh said that ex­pand­ing into over­seas mar­kets can be an ex­pen­sive and com­plex task for many com­pa­nies, es­pe­cially small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>UOB will be of­fer­ing bank­ing and dig­i­tal so­lu­tions through OneSME, in­clud­ing col­lec­tions and pay­ments, trade fi­nanc­ing and work­ing cap­i­tal needs, through a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing be­tween the lender and OneCon­nect.</p>
