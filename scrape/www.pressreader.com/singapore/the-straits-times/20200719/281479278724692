    <p>It was to be ex­pected that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic out­break, which ne­ces­si­tated the im­po­si­tion of cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, would af­fect re­tail­ers. How­ever, what is heart­en­ing is how they have sought to trans­form chal­lenge into op­por­tu­nity. Some of the more tra­di­tional re­tail­ers, too, ac­cel­er­ated their plans to go on­line and have even be­gun to ride on well-known e-com­merce plat­forms. Such plat­forms al­low them to not just pro­mote their prod­ucts, but in a num­ber of in­stances, to also pro­mote their e-vouch­ers that bring cus­tomers back to phys­i­cal stores that have now re­opened. The vouch­ers make the in­ter­est­ing point that, while more con­sumers turned in­creas­ingly to shop on­line dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, many did not re­vert to their pre­vi­ous habits af­ter the re­open­ing. Rather, they re­main ha­bit­u­ated to on­line shop­ping. The pro­mo­tion of e-vouch­ers now can at­tract them to re­turn to stores.</p>
    <p>Blur­ring the line be­tween on­line and off­line shop­ping is the new name of the game, and re­tail­ers are adapt­ing to it rapidly. A re­port in this news­pa­per in May pre­dicted the cas­cad­ing ef­fects of change. Ap­pear­ing at a time when the cir­cuit breaker led to most stores be­ing shut, the re­port said bluntly that re­tail­ers had two op­tions: adapt or die. In­dus­try ob­servers be­lieved that when the dust set­tled fi­nally, the re­tail land­scape was likely to be less vi­brant as smaller play­ers dis­ap­pear. Those that sur­vive would have to re­spond to new shop­ping habits and ma­jor chains would have to in­no­vate to avoid the fate of in­dus­try gi­ants that were top­pling over­seas. That lo­cal chains are do­ing well re­veals the na­ture of pri­vate en­ter­prise here. Com­pet­i­tive­ness is em­bed­ded in the genes of both busi­ness and so­ci­ety in a coun­try to which the world does not owe a liv­ing. Adap­ta­tion, in­no­va­tion and cre­ativ­ity are in­stinc­tive at­ti­tudes that have moulded the ex­pec­ta­tions of gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans. Covid-19 is prov­ing the re­sults.</p>
