    <p>NEW YORK Freez­ers re­quired to store Covid-19 vac­cines are i n place at health sys­tems that are pre­par­ing to ad­min­is­ter the ini­tial doses once the two lead­ing can­di­dates for shots re­ceive the green light from reg­u­la­tors, US health of­fi­cials have said.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment will have 40 mil­lion doses – enough to vac­ci­nate 20 mil­lion peo­ple – ready to dis­trib­ute by the end of next month should vac­cines de­vel­oped by Pfizer and its part­ner BioNTech, and Moderna re­ceive emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tions, said Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, chief sci­en­tific ad­viser to a joint US gov­ern­ment ef­fort for the vac­cines, on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The joint ef­fort is led by the De­part­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices, and De­fence De­part­ment to ex­pe­dite the devel­op­ment and distributi­on of coro­n­avirus vac­cines, dubbed Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and Moderna are both on the verge of sub­mit­ting ap­pli­ca­tions to the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA).</p>
    <p>The shots will be dis­trib­uted within 24 hours of an emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed has iden­ti­fied hos­pi­tals, phar­macy chains and uni­ver­si­ties that have cold-chain stor­age ca­pac­ity, and the first-avail­able vac­cine doses will ini­tially go to these ad­min­is­tra­tion sites.</p>
    <p>How to store and trans­port the vac­cine is a mat­ter of con­cern, specif­i­cally for Pfizer and BioNTech’s vac­cine, which must be stored at ul­tra cold tem­per­a­tures of neg­a­tive 70 deg C, thus re­quir­ing spe­cial freez­ers. In reg­u­lar re­frig­er­a­tors, it can be kept for up to only five days.</p>
    <p>The firms are seeking to cre­ate a sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion ver­sion of their two-dose reg­i­men that can with­stand warmer tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s vac­cine, on the other hand, can be stored at reg­u­lar re­frig­er­ated tem­per­a­tures for up to a month, and be kept in or­di­nary freez­ers for long-term use.</p>
    <p>That means it is a more vi­able op­tion for health­care fa­cil­i­ties in the United States and be­yond that lack cold-chain in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“The states have been work­ing with this,” General Gus­tave Perna, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, said during a media brief­ing.</p>
    <p>All vac­cine doses will ini­tially go to hos­pi­tals, uni­ver­si­ties and phar­ma­cies that have cold-chain stor­age abil­i­ties, to “make sure no vac</p>
    <p>Max­i­mum num­ber of days</p>
    <p>Pfizer and BioNTech’s vac­cine can be kept in reg­u­lar re­frig­er­a­tors. How to store and trans­port the vac­cine is a mat­ter of con­cern, specif­i­cally for Pfizer and BioNTech’s vac­cine, which must be stored at ul­tra cold tem­per­a­tures of neg­a­tive 70 deg C, thus re­quir­ing spe­cial freez­ers. cine is wasted”.</p>
    <p>“That’s only a con­straint be­cause of what we have to do to main­tain it at the right temperatur­e for sta­bil­ity,” Gen Perna said. “They can go into nor­mal re­frig­er­a­tion and then ex­e­cute them in five days.”</p>
    <p>He has also stressed to the var­i­ous ju­ris­dic­tions run­ning distributi­on at the local level, “don’t be afraid of the con­straints be­cause of the vac­cine and the temperatur­e re­quire­ments”.</p>
    <p>The US fed­eral gov­ern­ment has sup­ported states and local ju­ris­dic­tions, in­clud­ing con­duct­ing distributi­on re­hearsals, for the mo­ment US reg­u­la­tors grant an emer­gen­cyuse au­tho­ri­sa­tion to front run­ners in the race to de­velop a coro­n­avirus vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and its part­ner BioNTech, as well as Moderna, have re­cently demon­strated a 95 per cent ef­fi­cacy rate in pre­vent­ing symp­to­matic cases of Covid-19 in lat­estage tri­als of their vac­cine can­di­dates, of­fer­ing en­cour­ag­ing news amid a global surge i n cases.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment has iden­ti­fied 64 ju­ris­dic­tions – cities, ru­ral coun­ties, states – that will lead vac­cine distributi­on for their ar­eas.</p>
    <p>One of the prepara­tory steps for each area is an­tic­i­pat­ing and re­solv­ing distributi­on hur­dles that could cause vac­cine shots to be wasted, in­clud­ing cold-chain stor­age lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine distributi­on will start with those most vul­ner­a­ble to con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus and will roll into the next ad­min­is­tra­tion to the broader pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar said he does not ex­pect there to be any bumps “in the event of a tran­si­tion” be­cause ca­reer gov­ern­ment staff are han­dling Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, not po­lit­i­cal ap­pointees.</p>
    <p>It was a tacit nod to one of the most press­ing prob­lems for the tran­si­tion team of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, which is largely in the dark about the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s vac­cine roll-out plans.</p>
    <p>Be­yond shots de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech, and Moderna, two other can­di­dates that have en­tered into fi­nal-stage stud­ies have en­rolled 11,000 and 8,000 vol­un­teers, re­spec­tively, and are still re­cruit­ing. Dr Slaoui did not name those com­pa­nies, but Johnson & Johnson con­firmed it has more than 10,000 par­tic­i­pants in its phase three trial, and As­traZeneca re­cently re­sumed its phase three trial in the US.</p>
