    <p>Two Sin­ga­pore­ans have started Open Home Net­work, a move­ment to en­cour­age and sup­port fam­i­lies here in open­ing up their homes to pro­vide refuge for those fac­ing a cri­sis, such as the home­less or abuse vic­tims. Th­ese host fam­i­lies are will­ing to house those in dire straits rent-free, for up to one year.</p>
    <p>Two Sin­ga­pore­ans have started a move­ment to en­cour­age and sup­port fam­i­lies here in open­ing up their homes to pro­vide refuge for those fac­ing a cri­sis, such as the home­less or abuse vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Twenty fam­i­lies have signed up with the Open Home Net­work, a vol­un­teer move­ment of­fi­cially launched in June.</p>
    <p>Th­ese host fam­i­lies are will­ing to house those in dire straits rent-free, for up to one year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Heng, founder of Solve n+1, a so­cial en­ter­prise that fa­cil­i­tates so­cial in­no­va­tion for vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties, is one of the two peo­ple be­hind the move­ment.</p>
    <p>The other per­son is Mr Abra­ham Yeo, the 38-year-old co-founder of Home­less Hearts of Sin­ga­pore, a char­ity that helps the home­less.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, 31, said the net­work’s aim is to recre­ate the kam­pung spirit and tap host fam­i­lies to of­fer tem­po­rary shel­ter to those in need.</p>
    <p>He said: “In a kam­pung, peo­ple know each other, are open to one an­other, and are more ready to share their re­sources to meet the needs of oth­ers in their com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“In mod­ern Sin­ga­pore, the sense is that our com­mu­nity has be­come more pri­vate, with peo­ple more in­clined to mind their own busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the two-month-long cir­cuit breaker which ended on June 1, more peo­ple needed refuge as they ran into fi­nan­cial and so­cial dif­fi­cul­ties brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They in­clude those who lost their jobs and can no longer af­ford to pay rent, vic­tims of fam­ily vi­o­lence and those left stranded by Malaysia’s travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Most of the host fam­i­lies live in Hous­ing Board flats, with some in three-room flats. A few had va­cant apart­ments to of­fer.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said of those liv­ing in smaller flats: “It shows us that it’s not re­ally about space, but the size of their hearts, to be there for those in a cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>The net­work takes re­fer­rals from so­cial ser­vice agen­cies and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions, and both the host fam­ily and the per­son in cri­sis will meet to gauge if they are com­fort­able with each other be­fore the per­son moves in.</p>
    <p>Each host fam­ily houses one per­son or fam­ily in cri­sis at a time.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said they ad­vise host fam­i­lies to of­fer shel­ter for up to one year, but the length of stay re­ally de­pends on the in­di­vid­ual’s cir­cum­stances and the help needed to nav­i­gate through his cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng noted that while there are shel­ters for the home­less, th­ese fam­i­lies can com­ple­ment in­sti­tu­tions to of­fer care and shel­ter to those in need.</p>
    <p>“Host fam­i­lies can’t re­place pro­fes­sional ser­vices, which are needed, but they can com­ple­ment the restora­tive process by ex­tend­ing friend­ship, ac­cep­tance, love and care.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese re­la­tion­ships pro­vide sta­bil­ity be­tween tran­si­tions so that the per­son in cri­sis can feel enough warmth and se­cu­rity that will em­bolden them to con­tin­u­ously take steps for­ward for them­selves,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Those who have sought help in­clude home­less men from their 50s to 70s, and un­wed moth­ers in their 20s and 30s who needed a place to stay as their fam­i­lies were not sup­port­ive of their preg­nan­cies.</p>
    <p>There were also a few teenagers who needed refuge be­cause of vi­o­lence at home or strained ties with their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>When asked about pre­cau­tions to keep the coro­n­avirus at bay, Mr Heng said the so­cial work­ers re­fer­ring the per­son in cri­sis will do the nec­es­sary con­tact trac­ing and en­sure that both host fam­ily and guest are healthy, among the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures they have in place.</p>
    <p>Mr Lun Wei Ming and his wife Char­lene Lie, who are both 31, re­cently started host­ing an 18-yearold teen who needed refuge as his home en­vi­ron­ment was un­safe for him due to fam­ily vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Mr Lun, who also works at Solve n+1, said he was ini­tially ap­pre­hen­sive about their safety and se­cu­rity when Mr Heng asked the cou­ple if they could be a host fam­ily. The cou­ple, who live in a five-room HDB flat, do not have chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Madam Lie, a church worker, said of her ini­tial ap­pre­hen­sion: “Home is our most com­fort­able space and hav­ing some­one I don’t know live with us pushes us out of our com­fort zone.”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple de­cided to be­come a host fam­ily af­ter talk­ing to Mr Lun’s mum, who shared that his grand­mother used to shel­ter those in need in their home in a kam­pung.</p>
    <p>Madam Lie said of their ex­pe­ri­ence so far: “It has been re­ward­ing, although there are also chal­lenges ad­just­ing to an­other per­son. Our eyes and hearts have been opened to meet a young per­son in a cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>An­other host fam­ily is that of Mr Ter­rence Tan, a 46-year-old as­so­ciate lec­turer, and his wife, Madam Lim Mui Khim, a 42-yearold fi­nan­cial ad­viser.</p>
    <p>They have two daugh­ters, aged 10 and 12, and the fam­ily lives with Mr Tan’s par­ents in a four-storey semi-de­tached house.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim, who had a “chal­leng­ing child­hood”, said she was grate­ful for friends and rel­a­tives who al­lowed her to stay in their homes for short pe­ri­ods when things were too tense at her place. So she is pay­ing it for­ward.</p>
    <p>For a few months last year, the cou­ple hosted a 13-year-old girl who had very strained ties with her fa­ther, a sin­gle par­ent.</p>
    <p>Her so­cial worker felt that a short stay with a host fam­ily could give both the fa­ther and the girl – who grew up in a chil­dren’s home – breath­ing space, in the hope of mend­ing the re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) says it wel­comes ground-up ini­tia­tives to help the home­less.</p>
    <p>It had a vir­tual meet-up in May with the Open Home Net­work for them to un­der­stand each other’s ef­forts, and they had a “fruit­ful con­ver­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>The MSF spokesman said: “Both MSF and the Open Home Net­work share a com­mon un­der­stand­ing and pur­pose to help the home­less.”</p>
