    <p>BU­DAPEST • The coro­n­avirus pan­demic may have kept For­mula One fans away from races this year but, at the Hun­gar­ian Grand Prix, the third race of the sea­son, diehard fol­low­ers dot­ted the hills around the Hun­garor­ing cir­cuit near Bu­dapest.</p>
    <p>Zoltan Toth, a me­chanic from east­ern Hun­gary, checked into his usual camp­site, donned his old blue-and-white mul­let wig on a bald scalp, a tra­di­tional Mag­yar cos­tume, with a black “For­mula 1 fan” vest, and en­joyed the ac­tion as he has done for the past 20 years.</p>
    <p>“I have fol­lowed Kimi Raikko­nen ever since he be­gan to race and be­came a huge fan,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I have seen ev­ery race here in ev­ery year, and I won’t stop just be­cause the Ring is closed.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he is un­likely to see his idol win to­day, as the Finn fin­ished last in qual­i­fy­ing yes­ter­day in his Alfa Romeo.</p>
    <p>Six-time world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton clinched his 90th ca­reer pole in a track record of 1min 13.447sec, a tenth of a sec­ond faster than his Mercedes team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas. It was the Ger­man team’s 65th front-row lock­out.</p>
    <p>Asked about his im­pres­sive pole mark, the Bri­ton said: “I just have to pinch my­self, it doesn’t reg­is­ter. It feels very, very sur­real... it doesn’t seem real to have 90 poles.</p>
    <p>“It’s quite hum­bling to be hon­est be­cause I get to work with an in­cred­i­ble group of peo­ple, with­out them I wouldn’t have the op­por­tu­nity to do so. Mas­sively thank­ful to ev­ery­one who does such an amaz­ing job.</p>
    <p>“Valt­teri doesn’t make it easy for me at all, so it re­quires ab­so­lute per­fec­tion when do­ing laps and qual­i­fy­ing like that is one of the things I en­joy most.”</p>
    <p>It was his sec­ond suc­ces­sive pole and sev­enth at the Hun­garor­ing – on par with Michael Schu­macher. He is also aim­ing to win the race for the eighth time to­day to equal Schu­macher’s record for vic­to­ries at the same grand prix.</p>
    <p>The Fer­rari great won eight times at the French Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas, the leader in the driv­ers’ stand­ings, said: “I saw in P3 it was go­ing to be a close bat­tle with Lewis and, as a team, we were again on a re­ally strong level and apart from other teams, which is good for us.</p>
    <p>“At the end my Q3 lap was re­ally good but I couldn’t re­ally go faster. Lewis did a great job to­day to get the pole, as al­ways, and it’s go­ing to be a bit of a drag race into Turn One so I look for­ward to that.”</p>
    <p>There was some sur­prise as the</p>
    <p>Mercedes-pow­ered Rac­ing Point cars of Cana­dian Lance Stroll and Mex­i­can Ser­gio Perez locked out the sec­ond row.</p>
    <p>Said Stroll on qual­i­fy­ing third: “Re­ally great job by all the guys and I’m re­ally pleased with the ses­sion. Now sights set on to­mor­row and I’ll try and grab some big points.”</p>
    <p>Be­hind them are the two Fer­raris of Se­bas­tian Vet­tel and Charles Le­clerc, while Max Ver­stap­pen of Red Bull will start in sev­enth.</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen’s team­mate Alexan­der Al­bon could fin­ish only in 13th as both Red Bulls strug­gled for grip.</p>
    <p>Lando Nor­ris was eighth ahead of his McLaren t eam­mate Car­los Sainz, with Pierre Gasly, in his 50th grand prix, 10th for Al­pha Tauri.</p>
    <p>For­mer Bri­tish driver and Sky Sports pun­dit Martin Brun­dle had only praise for the dom­i­nant Mercedes duo, who were nearly a sec­ond ahead of Stroll.</p>
    <p>“What a pole that must be to drive,” he said, be­fore adding that Mercedes were in “a league of their own”.</p>
