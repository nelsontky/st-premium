    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion (SGX RegCo) has high­lighted ar­eas for im­prove­ment after its re­view of the work of spon­sors on the Catal­ist board.</p>
    <p>The in­au­gu­ral pub­li­ca­tion is part of a slate of ini­tia­tives to pro­vide trans­parency and to raise stan­dards across the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor also be­lieves it will im­prove ac­count­abil­ity within the</p>
    <p>Catal­ist regime.</p>
    <p>It comes shortly after a study noted that more than half of the Catal­ist-listed com­pa­nies in­curred fi­nan­cial losses for fis­cal year 2019, with those hav­ing been listed longer be­ing more likely to un­der­per­form.</p>
    <p>Out of 214 com­pa­nies, 56.5 per cent, or 121 firms, booked losses for last year, with those listed for more than seven years con­sti­tut­ing 71 per cent of these loss-mak­ing firms.</p>
    <p>The study, which also ex­am­ined all 20 spon­sors, urged a re­view of the Catal­ist board, cit­ing con­cerns over the con­flicts of in­ter­est in the spon­sors regime.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak Yuen Teen of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School, who co-au­thored the study, said it is time to re­assess the 12-year-old Catal­ist, cit­ing “ques­tions over the qual­ity of list­ings” due to ac­count­ing and cor­po­rate gov­er­nance is­sues emerg­ing soon after list­ing.</p>
    <p>SGX RegCo’s other ef­forts with spon­sors in­clude an an­nual di­a­logue on ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPOs), as well as con­tin­u­ing spon­sor­ship ac­tiv­i­ties and one-on-one en­gage­ments with cer­tain spon­sors to ad­dress key con­cerns.</p>
    <p>SGX RegCo chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Boon Gin said: “Spon­sors are the linch­pin in en­sur­ing the Catal­ist regime con­tin­ues to serve both in­vestors and is­suers.</p>
    <p>“SGX RegCo reg­u­larly re­views the work of those we reg­u­late, in­clud­ing con­tin­u­ing spon­sors, and this pub­li­ca­tion en­cap­su­lates some of our ob­ser­va­tions and les­sons learnt.”</p>
    <p>The Catal­ist regime has two types of spon­sors: Full spon­sors, which gen­er­ally con­duct “in­tro­duc­ing ac­tiv­i­ties” such as pre­par­ing com­pa­nies for an IPO; and con­tin­u­ing spon­sors, which work with com­pa­nies on con­tin­u­ing obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>After the list­ing of a Catal­ist is­suer, the full spon­sor will also be re­tained as the con­tin­u­ing spon­sor for at least three years.</p>
    <p>Un­like a main­board list­ing, which is sub­ject to ap­proval by the SGX and the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, a Catal­ist list­ing is su­per­vised and ap­proved by its ap­pointed spon­sor.</p>
    <p>Spon­sors are an­swer­able to the SGX and are sub­ject to re­view by the bourse oper­a­tor.</p>
    <p>SGX RegCo noted that 20 spon­sors are qual­i­fied to per­form con­tin­u­ing spon­sor­ship work, while 16 of these can also do in­tro­duc­ing work.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor will also pub­lish com­mon ob­ser­va­tions on other top­ics aris­ing from in­spec­tions and on­go­ing re­views of spon­sors.</p>
