    <p>TORONTO • Canada’s big­gest city has en­tered lock­down in the lat­est bid to curb coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, with case num­bers surg­ing across North Amer­ica even as US officials said vaccinatio­ns could be avail­able within weeks.</p>
    <p>En­cour­ag­ing re­sults from sev­eral vac­cine tri­als have raised hopes of a de­ci­sive shift in the bat­tle against a dis­ease that has claimed around 1.4 mil­lion lives world­wide in the last year.</p>
    <p>But see-saw­ing re­stric­tions and lock­downs in coun­tries that suc­cess­fully con­tained ear­lier out­breaks – shat­ter­ing lives and economies in the process – have high­lighted the on­go­ing risk of con­ta­gion.</p>
    <p>Start­ing yes­ter­day, Toronto has banned pri­vate in­door gath­er­ings and capped the size of wed­dings and fu­ner­als for four weeks, with officials warn­ing that hospi­tals risk be­ing over­whelmed with­out quick ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been clear on this – the sit­u­a­tion is ex­tremely se­ri­ous and fur­ther ac­tion is re­quired,” On­tario Premier Doug Ford had told jour­nal­ists ahead of the lock­down.</p>
    <p>Officials had fore­cast over 400,000 new in­fec­tions a week across Canada by the end of the year with­out new re­stric­tions – more than the to­tal num­ber of cases recorded na­tion­wide since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Mon­treal, all along the edges of a long boule­vard stretches an un­prece­dented sight in this city: hun­dreds of tents that have sprung up in a brand new home­less camp since the end of sum­mer, with many of the people thrown out of their homes be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Wel­come to the trendy en­camp­ment of NotreDame!” quipped Mr Jac­ques Brochu, dubbed “the mayor” by his neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>At 60, Mr Brochu said, he found him­self home­less and liv­ing in a tent on Notre-Dame Street af­ter los­ing his af­ford­able hous­ing, which was re­pos­sessed by its owner. Like his new neigh­bours, he is pre­par­ing for a cold Que­bec win­ter, where tem­per­a­tures of­ten plunge to mi­nus 20 deg C.</p>
    <p>“I man­age to heat my tent very well,” he said, show­ing off his small can­dles. A tar­pau­lin cov­er­ing the shel­ter does the rest.</p>
    <p>In the camp in Hochelaga, once a work­ing-class neigh­bour­hood in east­ern Mon­treal that is un­der­go­ing gen­tri­fi­ca­tion, the long-term home­less rub shoul­ders with people who have re­cently lost their jobs, as well as stu­dents and work­ers who have lost their homes.</p>
    <p>Mr Guy­lain Levasseur, 55, who has been home­less for six years and lives in a small car­a­van, is con­sid­ered the en­camp­ment’s “man­ager”.</p>
    <p>Un­der a canopy by his car­a­van, which is lined with arm­chairs, he has set up a kitchen of sorts, where people can come and take food or do­nate it.</p>
    <p>“There are people who come to bring us meals ev­ery day,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Serge Lareault, Mon­treal’s com­mis­sioner for the home­less, said the coro­n­avirus has “thrown hun­dreds of people onto the streets”. “The phe­nom­e­non of home­less en­camp­ments is new to Mon­treal,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last year, there were around 3,000 home­less people in the city, but that num­ber has snow­balled since the virus broke out, wreak­ing havoc on the econ­omy and squeez­ing af­ford­able hous­ing.</p>
    <p>“Our emer­gency shel­ters are over­flow­ing, and de­mand is still grow­ing; there are camps pretty much all around the city,” Mr Lareault said.</p>
