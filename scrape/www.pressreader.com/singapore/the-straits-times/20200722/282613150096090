    <p>NEW YORK The first word, black, was de­signed by Ti­jay Mo­hammed, a Ghana­ian-born artist, and used vi­brant Kente fab­ric de­sign and Adinkra sym­bols, which rep­re­sent con­cepts such as roy­alty, unity and le­gacy.</p>
    <p>Sophia Daw­son, a Brook­lyn­based vis­ual artist, took the sec­ond word, lives.</p>
    <p>The “L” con­tains the faces of the moth­ers who have lost their chil­dren to po­lice killings. The “I” uses im­agery in­spired by Emory Dou­glas, an artist for the Black Pan­ther Party; the “V” high­lights the cul­ture of the African di­as­pora; the “E” de­picts faces of Black Pan­ther Party mem­bers in prison; and the “S” car­ries a pas­sage from the Bi­ble.</p>
    <p>The street paint­ing at New York City’s Fo­ley Square re­sem­bles many that have been done around the country in its word choice and place­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, part of what has been lost in the na­tional de­bate over the art and the po­lit­i­cal state­ments they make is the lo­gis­ti­cal care, in­ten­tional place­ment and artistry that went into their cre­ation.</p>
    <p>While some such as those at Trump Tower and near the White House are pri­mar­ily sten­cil work in the blaz­ing yel­low paint typ­i­cally used for road mark­ings, and are known largely for their chal­leng­ing place­ment, oth­ers have been fully re­alised works of art that went through rig­or­ous pro­cesses of de­sign and plan­ning.</p>
    <p>This month, the Fo­ley Square street art in Lower Man­hat­tan and the one in Har­lem were un­veiled, with the mul­ti­coloured let­ters of Black Lives Mat­ter re­plete with im­agery re­lated to black people who were killed by the po­lice, as well as vi­brant sym­bols of free­dom, hope and joy.</p>
    <p>In Cincin­nati, the art ap­pears in the red, black and green of the Pan-African flag, with sil­hou­ettes, phrases and tex­tured de­signs filling the let­ters. In Jack­son, Michi­gan, it was de­signed in a graf­fiti-style font. In Port­land, Ore­gon, the l et­ters con­tained a time­line of his­tor­i­cal in­jus­tices in the state.</p>
    <p>The pur­pose of the Fifth Av­enue project at Trump Tower was clear: to rile up the pres­i­dent, who called it a “sym­bol of hate”. The other art­works in Man­hat­tan were in­tended not as po­lit­i­cal state­ments meant for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to see, but as an op­por­tu­nity for local artists, com­mu­nity to­geth­er­ness, and dis­cus­sions about race and polic­ing.</p>
    <p>The out­lines of the en­larged “Black Lives Mat­ter” let­ters are filled with in­ten­tion­ally placed sym­bols and colours.</p>
    <p>“I wanted the de­sign to em­body our ex­pe­ri­ence as a whole as a black com­mu­nity and what we strive for,” said Pa­trice Payne, one of the artists in­volved with the Fo­ley Square work.</p>
    <p>It hap­pened to be a work near the White House, spear­headed by the mayor of Wash­ing­ton, Ms Muriel Bowser, that set the ground­work for the coun­try­wide spilling of paint on the ground.</p>
    <p>There was a cer­tain ex­pec­ta­tion that Har­lem, known as the epi­cen­tre of black cul­ture, needed to take the trend a level up, said Ms Nikoa Evans-Hen­dricks, the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Har­lem Park to Park, an or­gan­i­sa­tion rep­re­sent­ing small­busi­ness own­ers in Har­lem.</p>
    <p>The re­sult was two sprawl­ing sets of words on both sides of Adam Clay­ton Pow­ell Jr Boule­vard, be­tween 125th and 127th Streets.</p>
    <p>The artists were cho­sen by Mr LeRone Wil­son, the art­work’s cu­ra­tor, who painted within the “L” the names of 24 black people killed by the po­lice, in­clud­ing Mr Ge­orge Floyd.</p>
    <p>Within the out­lines of other let­ters, the artists painted im­ages as­so­ci­ated with the out­rage over the po­lice’s treat­ment of black people.</p>
    <p>The artists re­ceived advice from the city’s de­part­ment of trans­porta­tion on which ma­te­ri­als to use on the as­phalt – namely, the rec­om­men­da­tion to use road line paint used for mark­ings on streets and side­walks – to make the street art more durable.</p>
    <p>The lo­ca­tion for the Har­lem work was cho­sen be­cause it was at the heart of a black com­mu­nity. In Lower Man­hat­tan at Fo­ley Square, it was be­cause of a cher­ished na­tional mon­u­ment nearby: It draws mean­ing from its prox­im­ity to the African Burial Ground, which con­tains the re­mains of New York City’s colo­nial African-Amer­i­can com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Since the first street paint­ing was un­veiled in Wash­ing­ton, some seg­ments of the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment have crit­i­cised them as be­ing purely sym­bolic ges­tures from politi­cians at a time when ac­tivists are call­ing for the de­fund­ing of po­lice de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>But the artists and de­sign­ers be­hind the com­mu­nity-driven works say there are im­por­tant uses for this sym­bol­ism, such as ed­u­ca­tion and pro­vid­ing mean­ing­ful pub­lic art com­mis­sions by black artists.</p>
    <p>Ms Evans-Hen­dricks re­mem­bers see­ing a mother walk­ing her son down the let­ters of the Har­lem street art, which are be­tween 4.3m and 4.9m wide, and ex­plain­ing the mean­ing of each word. “It has come alive in a way that the com­mu­nity re­ally needed,” she said.</p>
