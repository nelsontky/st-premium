        <p>When Caleb Lee was in Se­condary 2 in 2018, he woke up one morn­ing to jolts of pain in his thighs that were so ex­cru­ci­at­ing his mother took him to a poly­clinic.</p>
        <p>He was re­ferred that same day to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal, where he was di­ag­nosed with acute lym­phoblas­tic leukaemia.</p>
        <p>The St Hilda’s Se­condary School stu­dent told The Straits Times: “Ev­ery­thing went down­hill so fast and I was warded im­me­di­ately. When the doc­tor told my mother (the di­ag­no­sis), she came out of his of­fice cry­ing.</p>
        <p>“I thought: ‘What did I do to de­serve this?’ I was also crest­fallen be­cause there was not much I could do to change my con­di­tion.”</p>
        <p>Chemo­ther­apy was in­tense, and he was out of school for a year.</p>
        <p>He re­turned to join his class­mates in Se­condary 3, and with the help of his teach­ers and the ex­tra lessons they pro­vided, was pro­moted to Se­condary 4 last year.</p>
        <p>The 16-year-old was yes­ter­day elated to find out that he had at­tained two dis­tinc­tions out of six sub­jects.</p>
        <p>“I am very happy with my re­sults and grate­ful to every­one who has sup­ported me in my jour­ney,” he said.</p>
        <p>Caleb was hos­pi­talised four to five days a week dur­ing the most in­ten­sive pe­riod of his treat­ment.</p>
        <p>“(Be­fore the di­ag­no­sis), I was ac­tively par­tic­i­pat­ing in the stu­dent coun­cil. When I could not at­tend school for a year, I was lonely be­cause I saw pic­tures of my friends in school on so­cial me­dia, but I was at the hos­pi­tal or home,” said Caleb, who has a 19-year-old sis­ter.</p>
        <p>His fam­ily, teach­ers and friends sup­ported him through­out his re­cov­ery.</p>
        <p>Caleb was also de­ter­mined to take the O-level ex­ams with his class­mates.</p>
        <p>His teach­ers reg­u­larly or­gan­ised home vis­its and sent him work­sheets to help him catch up with his stud­ies.</p>
        <p>He also re­ceived ex­tra help by at­tend­ing the Chil­dren’s Can­cer Foun­da­tion’s school­ing pro­gramme, Place for Aca­demic Learn­ing and Sup­port.</p>
        <p>His can­cer has been in re­mis­sion for the past four months. He now hopes to fol­low in his mother’s foot­steps and be­come an ac­coun­tant.</p>
        <p>Caleb has se­cured a place in the Diploma in Ac­coun­tancy and Fi­nance pro­gramme at Te­masek Polytech­nic through the Early Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise.</p>
        <p>On what kept him mo­ti­vated, he said: “Even though the jour­ney was long and ar­du­ous, I al­ways tried to be pos­i­tive and know that this is part of life, which is full of ups and downs.</p>
        <p>“This ex­pe­ri­ence has also made me stronger and taught me to live my life with no re­grets.”</p>
        <p>This ex­pe­ri­ence has also made me stronger and taught me to live my life with no re­grets. CALEB LEE, whose can­cer has been in re­mis­sion for the past four months. ’’</p>
