    <p>Lo­cal ac­tress Con­stance Song has happy news to share.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old is preg­nant with her sec­ond child, a daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Song is six months preg­nant and her due date is ex­pected to be some time in March next year.</p>
    <p>She has an­other daugh­ter, aged three, who shares the same May 18 birth­day as her.</p>
    <p>It was a sur­prise back in 2017 when Song, who is man­aged by lo­cal ac­tor Li Nanx­ing’s tal­ent agency, an­nounced the birth of her first child as her ro­man­tic life had been kept un­der wraps.</p>
    <p>Song has con­tin­ued to em­pha­sise her de­sire to keep her fam­ily life pri­vate and has never re­vealed any de­tails of her part­ner or their re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Her mar­i­tal sta­tus is also un­clear. Shin Min Daily News re­ported that Song was ini­tially wor­ried her daugh­ter Olethea would be jeal­ous about the im­mi­nent ar­rival of a new baby, but her child sur­prised her by ask­ing for a sib­ling be­fore she was even three months preg­nant.</p>
    <p>Song says Olethea of­ten strokes her belly and whis­pers, “I love you so much”, to her un­born sis­ter.</p>
    <p>While be­ing preg­nant at 45 is con­sid­ered high-risk, the Tan­glin (2015 to 2018) ac­tress says she has had a smooth-sail­ing time so far with min­i­mal dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>This is likely to be her last baby. She says: “Two is enough, I won’t ask for a son. I’m wor­ried I won’t be able to take care of three kids.”</p>
