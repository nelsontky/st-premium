    <p>I have re­cently come across cases of maids not be­ing given enough nu­tri­tious food by their em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the process of hir­ing helpers for my fam­ily, I came across this com­mon grouse dur­ing in­ter­views. Two maids showed me pic­tures of what they claimed to be mea­gre meals given to them – plain boiled rice with ketchup – and claimed such in­ci­dents were not one-off but hap­pened fre­quently.</p>
    <p>When I asked them why they did not com­plain to the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), they said they were wor­ried about los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>While I know of em­ploy­ers who take their helpers to restau­rants with them, and there is no dearth of good souls, there still ap­pears to be a few em­ploy­ers in need of a wake-up call.</p>
    <p>More can be done to safe­guard these maids who leave their fam­ily to help us bring up our ba­bies, look after the el­derly and gen­er­ally make our life much eas­ier. I sug­gest that the MOM put in place manda­tory food guide­lines for maids – rice, bread, two serv­ings of veg­eta­bles, two serv­ings of fruit and some form of pro­tein (such as egg, chicken or lentils) every day.</p>
    <p>It is such a shame that in our pros­per­ous coun­try, we do not ap­pre­ci­ate the lux­ury of hav­ing full-time maids at our beck and call. The least we can do is feed them enough and well.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest that the MOM put in place manda­tory food guide­lines for maids – rice, bread, two serv­ings of veg­eta­bles, two serv­ings of fruit and some form of pro­tein every day.</p>
