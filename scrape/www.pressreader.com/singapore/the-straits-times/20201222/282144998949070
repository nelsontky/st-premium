    <p>Ler Teck Siang, the for­mer doc­tor em­broiled in the HIV registry data leak last year, has been sen­tenced to an ad­di­tional 10 months’ jail for fail­ing to pro­vide nar­cotics of­fi­cers with his urine sam­ple.</p>
    <p>The lat­est sen­tenc­ing yes­ter­day marked the end of crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings against Ler, 39, should there be no fur­ther ap­peals.</p>
    <p>He also ad­mit­ted to a charge un­der the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act (OSA) of fail­ing to re­tain pos­ses­sion of the HIV Registry, which he had ac­cess to when he was head of the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Unit. This charge was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ler had re­fused to pro­vide his urine spec­i­men to nar­cotics of­fi­cers af­ter he was ar­rested with a drug abuser at the Con­rad Cen­ten­nial ho­tel on March 2, 2018, the dis­trict court had found.</p>
    <p>Last year, he was sen­tenced to 15 months’ jail on two charges – one of in­ject­ing drugs into abusers for a fee and the other of pos­sess­ing drug uten­sils.</p>
    <p>This was on top of his two-year sen­tence for help­ing his HIV-pos­i­tive for­mer part­ner, Amer­i­can Mikhy Far­rera-Brochez, dupe the au­thor­i­ties into is­su­ing him a work pass.</p>
    <p>The for­mer doc­tor, who was struck off the med­i­cal reg­is­ter ear­lier this year, had claimed trial for all his charges ex­cept for the one re­lat­ing to the OSA.</p>
    <p>In this lat­est trial, Ler, who rep­re­sented him­self, claimed that he did not be­lieve the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) of­fi­cers were giv­ing him a “le­gal order” to pro­vide the urine sam­ple.</p>
    <p>He also al­leged that the of­fi­cers did not give him a time­frame for pro­vid­ing the sam­ple, tell him how much urine he should pro­duce, nor give him a re­cep­ta­cle to do so. Ler said that he could have “just pro­duced a drop of urine” in his pants and that “would have been pro­vid­ing urine”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dis­trict Judge Carol Ling said that whether Ler re­fused to give a urine spec­i­men or had failed to give one, the fact re­mains that no urine sam­ple was pro­duced to the CNB of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>She added that his al­le­ga­tions in the trial were just af­ter­thoughts.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor (DPP) Lu Yi­wei asked for 10 months’ jail, not­ing that Ler had “out­rightly de­fied” the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He had also claimed trial to the charge de­spite not hav­ing any ex­cuse to, and had con­cocted “cre­ative ex­cuses” for his fail­ure to pro­vide a urine spec­i­men, said DPP Lu.</p>
    <p>De­tails of 14,200 HIV-pos­i­tive pa­tients were leaked on­line by Far­rera-Brochez in the HIV registry scan­dal. He was last year sen­tenced to two years’ jail by an Amer­i­can court for us­ing the stolen HIV data­base to ex­tort from the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment.</p>
