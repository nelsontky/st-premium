    <p>Last week, the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) an­nounced that the next-gen­er­a­tion satel­lite-tracked Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) sys­tem will kick in from mid-2023.</p>
    <p>Here are 10 things you should know about the new sys­tem dubbed ERP 2.0.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>HOW DID IT ALL START?</p>
    <p>Work on a satel­lite-based, gantry-less ERP sys­tem started soon af­ter the cur­rent static sys­tem rolled out in 1998.</p>
    <p>Tri­als around 2006 or 2007 found that the tech­nol­ogy was not pre­cise enough then. But tri­als con­ducted from 2011, which cost about $12 mil­lion, found that the tech­nol­ogy had ma­tured enough.</p>
    <p>In 2016, a $556 mil­lion con­tract was awarded to NCS and MHI En­gine Sys­tem to build the sys­tem, which was slated to be rolled out by this year.</p>
    <p>The LTA said Covid-19 has dis­rupted global sup­ply chains, so ERP 2.0 will be switched on only in 2023.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>WHY DO WE NEED ERP 2.0?</p>
    <p>The cur­rent sys­tem is more than 20 years old, and is costly to op­er­ate and main­tain be­cause ex­pand­ing it would mean erect­ing more and more gantries.</p>
    <p>The new sys­tem is sup­posed to be light on hard­ware and can be de­ployed is­land­wide with­out costly and un­sightly street in­fras­truc­ture.</p>
    <p>And it has the ca­pa­bil­ity of charg­ing by dis­tance clocked by a mo­torist, mak­ing it a much sharper con­ges­tion-pric­ing tool than the cur­rent static cor­don-based sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In the cur­rent sys­tem, a mo­torist is free to drive as much as he de­sires once he passes a gantry.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>WHY WON’T DIS­TANCE-CHARG­ING BE IM­PLE­MENTED RIGHT AWAY?</p>
    <p>There are tech­ni­cal and po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions. Even though the con­trac­tor has been car­ry­ing out tests in a de­serted lo­ca­tion in Tuas South, the sys­tem must be proven to be ro­bust and pre­cise un­der real-world con­di­tions. No test can repli­cate such con­di­tions fully.</p>
    <p>As ERP has an im­pact on al­most ev­ery­body, not just mo­torists, a switch to dis­tance-charg­ing car­ries po­ten­tial po­lit­i­cal risks. The tim­ing of the switch is thus para­mount.</p>
    <p>But based on what Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said ear­lier this year, it will be “sev­eral years away”. Hence, it is un­likely to be dur­ing the cur­rent term of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>WILL WE END UP PAY­ING MORE WITH DIS­TANCE-CHARG­ING?</p>
    <p>Not nec­es­sar­ily. It de­pends on how much you drive or travel. A good anal­ogy would be per-minute carpark charges. It is cheaper than the pre­vi­ous block-based charges, and also fairer be­cause you pay for pre­cisely how much time you are parked.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, dis­tance-charg­ing is likely to be cheaper for those who drive ju­di­ciously or who plan their jour­neys well.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is likely to be costlier for those who clock high mileages, such as cab­bies, pri­vate-hire driv­ers and de­liv­ery­men. Trans­port op­er­a­tors are also likely to in­cur more charges.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>IS THE NEW SYS­TEM RE­ALLY GANTRY-LESS?</p>
    <p>Not ex­actly. As built-up ar­eas such as the Cen­tral Busi­ness District cre­ate a canyon ef­fect which dis­torts satel­lite lo­ca­tion sig­nals, street bea­cons are nec­es­sary to mit­i­gate this.</p>
    <p>To crack down on er­rant mo­torists who do not have an on-board unit (OBU) or who tam­per with one, en­force­ment cam­eras are still nec­es­sary. There will also be street signs to in­form mo­torists they are en­ter­ing a charged zone.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>DO WE RE­ALLY NEED TO IN­STALL THE CLUNKY THREE-PIECE OBU?</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, yes. But the LTA says it is look­ing at ways to in­stall the dis­play unit in a less ob­tru­sive way.</p>
    <p>In its pro­posed ori­en­ta­tion, the dis­play im­pedes road vis­i­bil­ity sig­nif­i­cantly more than the cur­rent in-ve­hi­cle unit.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate pro­cess­ing unit will re­quire ad­di­tional wiring and dis­man­tling of dash­board com­po­nents. Hope­fully, this does not com­pro­mise the in­tegrity of mod­ern ve­hi­cles, which have so­phis­ti­cated elec­tri­cal net­works.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>WILL THIS THREE-PIECE UNIT BE A BIG­GER DRAIN ON THE CAR’S BAT­TERY?</p>
    <p>The three-piece unit, with a pro­ces­sor and mon­i­tor, is likely to re­quire more power to run than the sim­ple in­ve­hi­cle unit. But it is un­likely to draw more power than, say, a se­cu­rity cam­era sys­tem.</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>WILL THE OBU BE ABLE TO IN­FORM MO­TORISTS OF CHARGES ALONG AN IN­TENDED ROUTE AND PRO­VIDE AL­TER­NA­TIVES?</p>
    <p>The ef­fec­tive­ness of pric­ing hinges largely on the avail­abil­ity of in­for­ma­tion. The LTA says the unit will pro­vide in­for­ma­tion on charg­ing lo­ca­tions and rates, as well as real-time traf­fic up­dates. How in­ter­ac­tive it is is not known at this point.</p>
    <p>9</p>
    <p>WHAT PAY­MENT MODES ARE AVAIL­ABLE, AND WILL THERE BE SEP­A­RATE DATA CHARGES?</p>
    <p>The OBU will ac­cept con­tact­less stored value cards. Mo­torists can also opt for card­less modes tied to their credit or debit cards. The LTA says users will not in­cur data charges.</p>
    <p>10</p>
    <p>WHAT ABOUT AT CARPARKS?</p>
    <p>Carpark sys­tems will have to be mod­i­fied to be com­pat­i­ble with the new OBU. Oth­er­wise, users will have to phys­i­cally tap in and out.</p>
