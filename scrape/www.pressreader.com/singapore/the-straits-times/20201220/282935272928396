    <p>• Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur man­ager Jose Mour­inho has brushed off crit­i­cism of his side’s con­ser­va­tive play­ing style in the af­ter­math of Wed­nes­day’s 2-1 de­feat by Liver­pool, say­ing there is too much em­pha­sis on mean­ing­less pos­ses­sion statis­tics.</p>
    <p>Spurs had just 24 per cent of the ball and 19 passes in the fi­nal third com­pared to Liver­pool’s 200. But Mour­inho in­sisted the bet­ter team had lost af­ter a 90thminute header f rom Roberto Firmino de­nied them a point.</p>
    <p>“I like ev­ery­thing in foot­ball,” he said ahead of to­day’s Pre­mier League game at home to Le­ices­ter City. “I like or­gan­ised at­tack, I like foot­ball with more tran­si­tions, I like to de­fend with a high block or with a low block.</p>
    <p>“The media love the word pos­ses­sion and stats. Some­times you say, ‘the stats say player B had 92 per cent ef­fi­ciency in his pass­ing’.</p>
    <p>“But they don’t say that player only made passes of two me­tres. And they don’t say that player was a cen­tre back who only passed to the other cen­tre back.</p>
    <p>“The stats many times are like an in­cred­i­ble piece of meat or fish but badly cooked. It doesn’t tell me much.</p>
    <p>“What it tells me is the num­ber of goals you score and chances you cre­ate. You can have less of the ball but score more goals.”</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers also looked be­yond the statis­tics and praised Mour­inho for his work since he was ap­pointed in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>“They’re set up very well. They’re very good on the coun­ter­at­tack and are well or­gan­ised,” Rodgers said. “They have tal­ents in (Harry) Kane and Son (He­ung­min) that can cause you prob­lems. They look like Jose’s team now.”</p>
    <p>Spurs have been boosted by the re­turn of Gareth Bale from ill­ness, al­though Mour­inho gave no in­di­ca­tion whether the Wales for­ward – who has made only one Pre­mier League start since re­turn­ing from Real Madrid – would fea­ture.</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese also praised Le­ices­ter striker Jamie Vardy, whose re­mark­able ca­reer continues to flour­ish at the age of 33, with 10 goals to his name in 11 Pre­mier League starts this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Vardy, who spear­headed Le­ices­ter’s fairy­tale Pre­mier League tri­umph in 2016, did not play in the top flight un­til 2014.</p>
    <p>“Fan­tas­tic player. If I was a de­fender I wouldn’t be happy to play against him be­cause he is very dan­ger­ous. He’s the kind of player I be­lieve would be im­por­tant in ev­ery team,” said Mour­inho.</p>
