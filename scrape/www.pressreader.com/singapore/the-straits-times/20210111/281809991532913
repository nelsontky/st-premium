    <p>Power was grad­u­ally be­ing re­stored to ma­jor cities across Pak­istan yes­ter­day after it was hit by a mas­sive elec­tric­ity black­out, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The elec­tric­ity dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tem in the na­tion of over 210 mil­lion peo­ple is a com­plex – and del­i­cate – web, and a prob­lem in one sec­tion of the grid can lead to cas­cad­ing break­downs coun­try­wide.</p>
    <p>Power min­is­ter Omar Ayub Khan told the press that the lat­est black­out was caused by an “engi­neer­ing fault” in south­ern Pak­istan at 11.41pm lo­cal time on Satur­day, caus­ing the sys­tem to trip and power plants to shut down.</p>
    <p>“Our ex­perts are try­ing to de­ter­mine the ex­act lo­ca­tion of the fault, which we have not been able to find out,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that it will take “an­other few hours as the area is still cov­ered in dense fog”, and that power sup­ply had been par­tially re­stored in most ar­eas of Pun­jab, the most pop­u­lous prov­ince, as well as the eco­nomic hub Karachi.</p>
    <p>“We hope to bring the sys­tem back to its full ca­pac­ity by this evening, but it will take some time for nu­clear and ther­mal power plants to get op­er­a­tional,” Mr Khan tweeted.</p>
    <p>This was Pak­istan’s sec­ond ma­jor power break­down in less than three years. In May 2018, power was par­tially dis­rupted for more than nine hours.</p>
