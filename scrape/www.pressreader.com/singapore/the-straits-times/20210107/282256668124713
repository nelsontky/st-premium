    <p>Small- and mid-cap (SMC) stocks in Sin­ga­pore are ex­pected to catch up with the larger caps on at­trac­tive valu­a­tions against the back­drop of pos­i­tive Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­op­ments this year, said DBS Group Re­search.</p>
    <p>“Lock­down losers” such as the avi­a­tion, hospi­tal­ity and re­tail sec­tors have been among the worsthit, but there is light at the end of the tun­nel as vac­cines be­come available now, said DBS an­a­lyst Ling Lee Keng in a re­search note late on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times In­dex (STI) has re­bounded 17 per cent since the start of Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Travel-re­lated plays like ho­tels and air­lines, as well as banks, re­bounded strongly as in­vestors turned their at­ten­tion to value plays on the back of pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ments on vac­cines, lead­ing to the STI’s strong re­bound, she said.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the FTSE ST Small Cap In­dex gained only 10 per cent dur­ing the same pe­riod, to un­der­per­form in con­trast.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling added: “With the grad­ual re­cov­ery of the global economies and the avail­abil­ity of Covid-19 vac­cines in cer­tain coun­tries, we ex­pect the re­bound in smaller-cap stocks to ac­cel­er­ate and catch up with the larger caps.”</p>
    <p>In hospi­tal­ity, travel is ex­pected to restart for the ma­jor­ity of busi­ness meet­ings. To­gether with the strong pent-up de­mand for leisure travel, DBS’ re­search team sees a V-shaped re­cov­ery tak­ing shape as early as the sec­ond half of this year, as­sum­ing mass dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines is pos­si­ble in the first half. Its top picks are As­cott Res­i­dence Trust and CDL Hospi­tal­ity Trusts for their at­trac­tive valu­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, malls with “dom­i­nant char­ac­ter­is­tics” will emerge as win­ners in this new nor­mal, as re­tail­ers “hand­pick” their phys­i­cal store­fronts to max­imise vis­i­bil­ity and sales.</p>
    <p>In the SMC space, the Lendlease Reit (real es­tate in­vest­ment trust) port­fo­lio should en­able it to buck the trend and de­liver op­er­at­ing per­for­mance close to, or above, pre-Covid lev­els ahead of its peers, said Ms Ling.</p>
    <p>She also ex­pects the merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions (M&A) and pri­vati­sa­tion trend to con­tinue, es­pe­cially in the tech­nol­ogy, Reits and con­sumer sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Last year, all 13 deals were in the Reits/prop­erty, in­dus­trial, tech­nol­ogy and con­sumer sec­tors. This num­ber is only about half of the 28 deals in 2019, mainly at­trib­ut­able to the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But bank­rupt­cies and the num­ber of dis­tressed com­pa­nies are likely to rise amid the on­go­ing cri­sis, pre­sent­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for M&A as com­pa­nies look for both shel­ter and new op­por­tu­ni­ties, said Ms Ling.</p>
    <p>Fac­tors driv­ing M&A and pri­vati­sa­tion in­clude lim­ited ne­ces­sity for ac­cess to equity cap­i­tal mar­kets, cost sav­ings, re­struc­tur­ing and stream­lin­ing of op­er­a­tions, en­abling man­age­ment to fo­cus on long-term goals with­out hav­ing to also worry about meet­ing share­hold­ers’ short-term de­mands.</p>
    <p>Many tech man­u­fac­tur­ers, for in­stance, are re­think­ing their sup­ply sources, to bal­ance ef­fi­cien­cies, re­silience, costs and di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of their pro­duc­tion net­works, said Ms Ling.</p>
    <p>Among some of the op­tions: Shift­ing their sup­ply chains out of China to other Asean coun­tries or back to the United States. How­ever, this process would take time; more­over, not all man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses can be eas­ily trans­ferred out of China.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing these fac­tors into con­sid­er­a­tion, the M&A or pri­vati­sa­tion route could be a vi­able op­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said: “It does make eco­nomic sense for tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies to adopt the M&A route, as some of these com­pa­nies may have com­mon cus­tomers, pro­vide sim­i­lar ser­vices or man­u­fac­ture sim­i­lar prod­ucts. Syn­er­gis­tic ac­qui­si­tions can also of­fer other sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fits such as economies of scale and in­creased mar­ket share.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, delist­ing can also lead to cost sav­ings from com­pli­ance and as­so­ci­ated costs re­lat­ing to list­ing re­quire­ments and reg­u­lar dis­clo­sures.”</p>
    <p>GLOBAL RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>With the grad­ual re­cov­ery of the global economies and the avail­abil­ity of Covid-19 vac­cines in cer­tain coun­tries, we ex­pect the re­bound in smaller-cap stocks to ac­cel­er­ate and catch up with the larger caps.</p>
