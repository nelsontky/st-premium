    <p>The multi­na­tional telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and con­sumer elec­tron­ics gi­ant Huawei had hum­ble be­gin­nings as a small-time tele­coms equip­ment trader in Shen­zhen in 1987.</p>
    <p>But over three decades, former Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army engi­neer Ren Zhengfei turned it into a global con­glom­er­ate.</p>
    <p>It is now the world’s sec­ond­largest smart­phone man­u­fac­turer, ahead of Ap­ple and be­hind Sam­sung. It is also the top sup­plier of tele­coms net­work­ing equip­ment, sur­pass­ing Eric­s­son in 2012.</p>
    <p>The Shen­zhen-based con­glom­er­ate has 180,000 em­ploy­ees and op­er­ates in more than 170 coun­tries. It is also em­ployee-owned, chalk­ing up 858.8 bil­lion yuan (S$169.2 bil­lion) in rev­enue last year.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has long been a US tar­get over es­pi­onage con­cerns, its dom­i­nance in 5G tech­nol­ogy and vi­o­la­tions of US sanc­tions on Iran.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren’s daugh­ter and Huawei’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Meng Wanzhou is still in Canada wait­ing to be ex­tra­dited to the United States, where she faces fraud charges re­lated to breach­ing the sanc­tions against Iran.</p>
    <p>Last year, Washington added Huawei to a trade black­list, re­strict­ing its abil­ity to buy Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy and ser­vices with­out its ap­proval.</p>
    <p>While it has since been given some ex­emp­tions to con­tinue buy­ing from some Amer­i­can sup­pli­ers, Huawei has been rac­ing to de­velop its own tech­nolo­gies, in­clud­ing Har­monyOS, for its own de­vices.</p>
    <p>Not much is known of Huawei’s fi­nan­cial and or­gan­i­sa­tional struc­ture, and un­til its re­cent run-ins with Washington reached a cli­max last year, Mr Ren largely kept a low pro­file and did not give me­dia in­ter­views.</p>
