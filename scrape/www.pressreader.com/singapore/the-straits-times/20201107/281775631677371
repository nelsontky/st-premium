    <p>Some 2,700 lo­cal com­pa­nies in the re­tail and food ser­vices sec­tors re­ceived about $6.8 mil­lion from the Gov­ern­ment be­tween Au­gust and last month to sup­port the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of their busi­nesses, Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sum was dis­bursed through the Dig­i­tal Re­silience Bonus (DRB), which of­fers up to $10,000 each for com­pa­nies that adopt dig­i­tal solutions in any three cat­e­gories by June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can dig­i­talise their hu­man re­sources or pay­roll op­er­a­tions, build an on­line pres­ence through e-com­merce or adopt data an­a­lyt­ics, among other dig­i­tal solutions.</p>
    <p>“What (the amount paid out) un­der­scores is that the level of aware­ness for the im­por­tance of us­ing dig­i­tal solutions among our en­ter­prises has been sig­nif­i­cantly height­ened by the Covid-19 ex­pe­ri­ence,” said Mr Iswaran.</p>
    <p>“That aware­ness is trans­lat­ing into tan­gi­ble ac­tion steps as re­flected in the broader re­sponse to our SMEs Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme, which has seen a dou­bling in the num­ber of SMEs (small and medium-sized en­ter­prises) tak­ing up dig­i­tal solutions in the last six months.”</p>
    <p>The SMEs Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme, launched by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity in April 2017, in­cludes as­sis­tance such as the DRB, in­dus­try dig­i­tal plans and pre-ap­proved dig­i­tal solutions that are mar­ket-proven.</p>
    <p>More than 50,000 SMEs have taken up dig­i­tal solutions un­der the pro­gramme as of Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran was speak­ing at Fu­nan mall, where he vis­ited two ten­ants who have re­ceived the DRB and ben­e­fited from other gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies to go dig­i­tal amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>One ben­e­fi­ciary is de­sign and gar­den­ing store The Green Cap­sule, which spe­cialises in in­door plants and also con­ducts work­shops teach­ing cus­tomers how to set up their own ter­rar­i­ums.</p>
    <p>Owner Ricky Lim, 37, re­ceived a $2,500 DRB pay­out in Au­gust for im­ple­ment­ing an e-com­merce so­lu­tion which helped him tide over the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when there was no brick­sand-mor­tar busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“We were lucky in a way to have launched (our web­site) dur­ing the sec­ond week of the cir­cuit breaker in April, which caught many peo­ple at a time when they were pick­ing up new in­door hob­bies,” said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>“With the (e-com­merce so­lu­tion), we were also able to see how many peo­ple were com­ing to our web­site and what they were look­ing at and buy­ing.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, our DIY kits were very pop­u­lar, for ex­am­ple.”</p>
    <p>The sum was dis­bursed through the Dig­i­tal Re­silience Bonus (DRB), which of­fers up to $10,000 each for com­pa­nies that adopt dig­i­tal solutions in any three cat­e­gories by June 30 next year.</p>
