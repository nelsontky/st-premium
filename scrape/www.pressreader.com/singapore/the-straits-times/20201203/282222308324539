    <p>Firms in Sin­ga­pore are dou­bling down on ex­pand­ing their busi­ness net­works in Asia and build­ing re­silience in their sup­ply chains de­spite hav­ing a more pes­simistic eco­nomic out­look than busi­nesses else­where, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey.</p>
    <p>HSBC Bank’s an­nual Nav­i­ga­tor sur­vey, re­leased yes­ter­day, also found that lo­cal firms ex­pect a longer re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic than those in the Asia-Pa­cific and be­yond, due to Sin­ga­pore’s open and trade-de­pen­dent econ­omy.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, busi­nesses here are con­tin­u­ing to in­crease their growth in­vest­ment. Some 87 per cent of re­spon­dents plan to ex­pand in the re­gion over the next three to five years, com­pared with 76 per cent of busi­nesses else­where.</p>
    <p>About half or 51 per cent of lo­cal firms are im­me­di­ately in­vest­ing in over­seas ex­pan­sion, com­pared with 44 per cent in the Asia-Pa­cific. This is de­spite over twothirds of re­spon­dents in Sin­ga­pore ex­pect­ing cross-bor­der trade to be­come more dif­fi­cult than it was pre-pan­demic, said HSBC.</p>
    <p>“In­tra-re­gional trade dom­i­nates, with more than eight in 10 busi­nesses trad­ing within the Asia-Pa­cific,” the re­port said. “Trade with lead­ing part­ner, main­land China has grown, as it has with Malaysia.”</p>
    <p>The sur­vey con­ducted in Septem­ber in­volved 2,500 busi­nesses world­wide, in­clud­ing 200 in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Iain Morrison, head of global trade and re­ceiv­ables fi­nance at HSBC Sin­ga­pore, said: “There’s no doubt Sin­ga­pore’s busi­nesses have been hard hit; it comes with the ter­ri­tory of be­ing one of the world’s most in­ter­na­tion­ally con­nected trad­ing hubs... Yet it’s en­cour­ag­ing to see they are still in­vest­ing for growth; dig­ging deep to strengthen Asian trade links and seek­ing open, eas­ier and safer trade.”</p>
    <p>Al­most all re­spon­dents in Sin­ga­pore had con­cerns about their sup­ply chains, mainly with time spent on man­age­ment, in­sta­bil­ity and pos­si­ble tar­iffs. Some 63 per cent are look­ing to in­clude dig­i­tal tools or tech­nol­ogy, com­pared with 48 per cent of global firms sur­veyed.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the sur­vey, sev­eral firms here said the pan­demic has un­der­scored the need for more re­silient sup­ply chains and more di­verse mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>San­i­tary ware spe­cial­ist Ei­lu­mina Re­sources di­rec­tor Lew Ee Ling said it does not make sense to fo­cus on only the lo­cal mar­ket, given the small size of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, as it would not be able to reap the ad­van­tages of economies of scale. She said the South-east Asian mar­ket has al­ways been on the radar, adding that the pan­demic has halted its am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>“In fact, it helped us to relook our strate­gies and made us more de­ter­mined to get our brand across to our mar­kets now that big play­ers are prob­a­bly dragged down by high ex­pen­di­ture, and us be­ing small and nim­ble can change our course and adapt more quickly to ride out this wave,” Ms Lew added.</p>
    <p>Cer­tact En­gi­neer­ing manag­ing di­rec­tor El­lis Eng said the firm’s sup­ply chain was greatly dis­rupted, with lead time for de­liv­ery of plas­tic raw ma­te­ri­als from its sup­plier in the United States raised from four to 20 weeks.</p>
    <p>The firm has started ex­plor­ing other op­tions from coun­tries such as Ja­pan and South Korea. Its cap­i­tal in­vest­ment this year has been the high­est so far de­spite the Covid-19 out­break, she said, as it has ac­quired more ma­chin­ery and manpower af­ter adding plas­tic en­gi­neer­ing to its ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
