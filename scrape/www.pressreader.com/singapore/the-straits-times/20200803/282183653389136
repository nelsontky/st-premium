    <p>Mr Pri­tam Singh’s de­ci­sion to set aside a por­tion of his al­lowance as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion ex­clu­sively for res­i­dents in con­stituen­cies held by the Work­ers’ Party leaves me both dis­ap­pointed and per­turbed (Pri­tam to do­nate half his pay in­crease as Leader of Op­po­si­tion, July 31).</p>
    <p>The al­lowance be­stowed upon the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion and, in­deed, our min­is­ters, is en­trusted to them through our col­lec­tive vote.</p>
    <p>Whether you be­lieve that the amount they earn from their ap­point­ments is jus­ti­fied, the im­pli­ca­tion is that this sum is an in­vest­ment in their judg­ment and abil­ity to work to­wards the bet­ter­ment of every ci­ti­zen in the coun­try they now serve.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing foisted this re­spon­si­bil­ity upon in­di­vid­u­als, how­ever, it is left to their dis­cre­tion to spend the money as they see fit, led by their per­sonal bi­ases and mo­ti­va­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh’s de­ci­sion to de­clare his in­ten­tions in the man­ner that he did sug­gests to me two nar­ra­tives.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther he is openly buy­ing the votes of his con­stituents while stok­ing po­lit­i­cal po­lar­i­sa­tion, or his short­sighted and ar­guably naive gen­eros­ity blinds him to the base trib­al­ism that he in­cites and en­cour­ages in his party’s sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Per­haps he seeks to lead by ex­am­ple through char­ity. But more than in­spir­ing kind­ness and tol­er­ance, I see greater divi­sion among my fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>As Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, us­ing the words of one of his own party mem­bers, MP Ja­mus Lim, Mr Singh ought to be “mind­ful of the risks of in­vol­un­tary ex­clu­sion/in­clu­sion, which can re­sult in per­cep­tions of un­fair or bi­ased treat­ment”.</p>
