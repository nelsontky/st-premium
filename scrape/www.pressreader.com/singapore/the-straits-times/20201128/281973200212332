    <p>As an­a­lysts pore over US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s Cab­i­net picks for signs of what to ex­pect by way of Asia pol­icy di­rec­tions, let us con­sider the other side of the coin – what awaits the new ad­min­is­tra­tion as it gets down to chang­ing course and re­set­ting re­la­tions with re­gional friends and allies after four years of Trumpian up­heavals.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial signs seem re­as­sur­ing. Mr Bi­den has stated in no un­cer­tain terms that he wishes to re­build ties with the re­gion. His nom­i­nee for Sec­re­tary of State, Antony Blinken, is a sea­soned diplo­mat, a mul­ti­lat­er­al­ist praised as a safe pair of hands. Mean­while, Michele Flournoy, a lead­ing can­di­date for Sec­re­tary of</p>
    <p>De­fence, is in pos­ses­sion of one of the sharpest na­tional se­cu­rity minds in Washington. Al­though Jake Sul­li­van may be one of the youngest oc­cu­pants of the seat of Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser if ap­pointed, he al­ready has deep ex­pe­ri­ence in Middle East and Asia-Pa­cific af­fairs by dint of his var­i­ous roles in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Not­with­stand­ing the im­pres­sive po­ten­tial in the likely Cab­i­net, will the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion have an easy time of it in Asia? To an­swer that ques­tion, we should probe deeper into some of the more con­se­quen­tial changes that have occurred in the past four years, and how they por­tend chal­lenges that await the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>RESTOR­ING TRUST AND GOOD RE­LA­TIONS WITH ALLIES</p>
    <p>Ja­pan and South Korea are long­stand­ing treaty allies and key to Amer­ica’s de­fence pos­ture in Asia. Yet, while for­mer Ja­panese prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe fa­mously man­aged to build a strong per­sonal re­la­tion­ship with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, that did not stop the US from threat­en­ing its clos­est Asian ally with steel tar­iffs, arm twist­ing it to cough up more money to sus­tain the US troop pres­ence in Ja­pan, and rush­ing ahead with the 2018 land­mark sum­mit with North Korea with­out con­sult­ing Tokyo.</p>
    <p>With Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga com­mit­ted to con­tin­u­ing his pre­de­ces­sor’s for­eign poli­cies, Tokyo is cast­ing an anx­ious eye over Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den’s ap­proach to China. A sim­i­lar mood pre­vails in other re­gional cap­i­tals – most no­tably Hanoi, New Delhi and Can­berra, where some mea­sure of con­cern ob­tains that, hav­ing gen­er­ated mo­men­tum with the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue and placed it on a firm foot­ing, Mr Bi­den might turn his gaze from the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, South Korea was caught off guard when Mr Trump uni­lat­er­ally an­nounced the can­cel­la­tion of bi­lat­eral war games at the con­clu­sion of his Sin­ga­pore sum­mit meet­ing with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Now that Mr Trump is on his way out, and his three meet­ings with Mr Kim flat­tered to de­ceive, Seoul is left to pick up the pieces on Korean penin­sula denucleari­sation diplo­macy.</p>
    <p>At any rate, re­as­sur­ing his Ja­panese and Korean allies will not be the only chal­lenges await­ing Mr Bi­den in North-east Asia. His ad­min­is­tra­tion must also be cog­nisant of how dy­nam­ics in the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two have de­te­ri­o­rated in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>2016 was a high-wa­ter mark – when a land­mark ac­cord at the close of 2015 to re­solve the long­stand­ing “com­fort women” is­sue was fol­lowed by other eco­nomic and se­cu­rity agree­ments. But things went south sharply after a South Korean Supreme Court rul­ing in 2018 that re­quired Ja­panese firms to pay com­pen­sa­tion to Korean work­ers for wartime labour. Ja­pan’s re­tal­ia­tory trade curbs and Korean na­tion­al­ist boy­cotts sent bi­lat­eral ties into a deep chill.</p>
    <p>De­layed, half-hearted ef­forts by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to in­ter­vene proved in­ef­fec­tive. Given how Ja­pan and South Korea are linch­pins for US strate­gic ob­jec­tives in Asia, it is im­per­a­tive for any US ad­min­is­tra­tion to get them to sta­bilise their re­la­tion­ship and work to­gether to stay the course in pur­suit of shared in­ter­ests in re­la­tion to the se­cu­rity and eco­nomic chal­lenges they col­lec­tively face. But, given the mood that cur­rently pre­vails be­tween the two, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will have its work cut out for it.</p>
    <p>THE EF­FECTS OF CHI­NESE ECO­NOMIC STATE­CRAFT</p>
    <p>For the United States, no con­tem­pla­tion of Asia pol­icy can ig­nore the China fac­tor. As pres­i­dent, Mr Trump placed China at the cen­tre of his do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal nar­ra­tive on any­thing from na­tional se­cu­rity and univer­sity en­rol­ments to pub­lic health and the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But in set­ting re­la­tions with China down the rocky road of con­flict with hy­per­bol­i­cally hos­tile rhetoric, the US has quick­ened Chi­nese re­solve.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has hit back with equally sharp el­bows: meet­ing Amer­i­can tar­iffs with Chi­nese tar­iffs, the ex­pul­sion of Amer­i­can jour­nal­ists with Chi­nese diplo­mats, and cir­cum­scrip­tion of Chi­nese com­pa­nies on the US “en­ti­ties list” by cir­cum­scrib­ing Amer­i­can com­pa­nies with their own</p>
    <p>“un­re­li­able en­ti­ties list”.</p>
    <p>All this while, how­ever, China’s eco­nomic im­por­tance to the re­gion has grown. For in­stance, Asean’s trade with the ex­ter­nal part­ners be­tween 2016 and 2019 has mostly ei­ther de­clined (Ja­pan and the Euro­pean Union) or re­mained static (US), ac­cord­ing to CEIC Data fig­ures. The only ex­cep­tion is trade with China, which in­creased sub­stan­tially dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Al­though it pre­dates the Trump res­i­dency, China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive has con­tin­ued apace. Though not a China-led ini­tia­tive, the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship will nev­er­the­less al­low China to ce­ment its role as a key driver of re­gional eco­nomic growth by dint of the size of its econ­omy and mar­ket. The arid re­al­ity con­fronting the US is that re­gional states, many of which are still de­vel­op­ing economies, con­tinue to pri­ori­tise eco­nomic devel­op­ment, to which China’s con­tri­bu­tions have been grow­ing rel­a­tive to the US’ in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>This is not to say that se­cu­rity con­cerns do not mat­ter. They do. But a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would do well to un­der­stand that the im­me­di­ate pain point for many re­gional states re­mains eco­nomic in na­ture, and so, their re­sponse to bi­nary su­per­power ri­valry is not pred­i­cated on al­le­giance but on au­ton­omy and di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion, which for them is im­per­a­tive.</p>
    <p>To that end, the un­cer­tain­ties pre­cip­i­tated by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s for­eign poli­cies and its fail­ure to com­pel re­gional states to align them­selves lock, stock and bar­rel with US po­si­tions on any given is­sue have catal­ysed the re­con­fig­u­ra­tion of re­gional re­la­tion­ships, where re­gional states no longer wait for US lead­er­ship but proac­tively take a broader view of their in­di­vid­ual as well as col­lec­tive in­ter­ests, lead­ing to the di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of their part­ner­ships so as to not be over-re­liant on any sin­gle ma­jor power.</p>
    <p>DEMOC­RACY AND POP­ULISM</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, while the Bi­den win can be in­ter­preted as some­thing of a roll­back of pop­ulist pol­i­tics in the US, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would do well to re­alise that pop­ulism is alive and well in Asia, even as it finds ex­pres­sion in dif­fer­ent forms and lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The fore­most ex­am­ple, ar­guably, is in the Philip­pines, where Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte, who once pub­licly swore at Mr Barack Obama when the for­mer US pres­i­dent crit­i­cised his war on drugs for its sanc­tion­ing of ex­tra­ju­di­cial killing, had openly sup­ported a Trump sec­ond term.</p>
    <p>At stake, among other things, is the re­newal of the Vis­it­ing Forces Agree­ment with the US, which Mr Duterte sig­nalled his in­ten­tion to abrogate in Fe­bru­ary. That de­ci­sion is be­ing held in abeyance fol­low­ing the interventi­on of the Philip­pine Supreme Court. While Mr Duterte has only 11/ years to go</p>
    <p>2 in of­fice, get­ting Philip­pine-US de­fence re­la­tions back on track must be a pri­or­ity for the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion. The chal­lenge how­ever, is how to ac­com­plish that while pres­sur­ing Mr Duterte on hu­man rights is­sues.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den will also have to fi­nesse his ap­proach to Myan­mar, where the Na­tional League for Democ­racy was re­cently re­turned to power with an im­proved ma­jor­ity. That vic­tory owed no small mea­sure to the mas­sive do­mes­tic pop­u­lar­ity of Aung San Suu Kyi, even if “The Lady” has lost much of her shine as an icon of democ­racy and hu­man rights in the eyes of some in the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>In the tra­di­tion of Demo­cratic pres­i­den­cies and Amer­i­can diplo­macy more gen­er­ally, Mr Bi­den will doubt­less have much to say about the plight of the Ro­hingya. But in do­ing so, he would be well-ad­vised to bear in mind the re­al­ity that Chi­nese ac­cess to the Bay of Ben­gal and the In­dian Ocean runs through Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>And then there is India. Not only did Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi get along per­son­ally with Pres­i­dent Trump, there was also grow­ing con­ver­gence in strate­gic out­looks be­tween Washington and New Delhi. A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will nev­er­the­less have its hands full try­ing to main­tain mo­men­tum in strate­gic re­la­tions while re­spond­ing to the up­surge in Hindu na­tion­al­ism in India and grow­ing in­ter­na­tional con­cern about mi­nor­ity rights in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Await­ing the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion then, is a re­gional se­cu­rity and eco­nomic land­scape that is not only increasing­ly mul­ti­po­lar in na­ture, but also de­fined by dy­nam­ics that have grown more com­plex in the past four years. Look­ing ahead, the Bi­den pres­i­dency must fac­tor these new geopo­lit­i­cal re­al­i­ties into how it as­sesses its ob­jec­tives, role and place in the re­gion.</p>
