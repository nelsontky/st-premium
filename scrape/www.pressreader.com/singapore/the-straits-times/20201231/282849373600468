    <p>Chi­nese movie The Res­cue was meant to be re­leased dur­ing the Chi­nese New Year sea­son this year, but was put on hold be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It fi­nally made it to the cine­mas this month and opens here to­day.</p>
    <p>And the ac­tion-packed movie – about mem­bers of the China Res­cue and Sal­vage team which con­ducts life-sav­ing mis­sions in Chi­nese wa­ters – has now taken on a new mean­ing for its Tai­wanese star Ed­die Peng.</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old ac­tor says in a voice mes­sage to The Straits Times: “It was orig­i­nally a film about res­cue mis­sions, but now it re­ally feels like a story about name­less front-line he­roes. They’ve sac­ri­ficed more than any­one this year and are the real he­roes pro­tect­ing the world daily.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong di­rec­tor Dante Lam, who has worked with Peng mul­ti­ple times on films such as sports dra­mas Un­beat­able (2013) and To The Fore (2015), as well as crime flick Op­er­a­tion Mekong (2016), shares Peng’s sen­ti­ments .</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ter­view, the 56-year-old says: “It def­i­nitely feels more mean­ing­ful now, like an ode to first re­spon­ders.”</p>
    <p>Plans to pro­mote the film were dis­rupted by Covid-19, which plagued China in the ear­lier part of the year.</p>
    <p>When they flew to Bei­jing for the pre­miere this month, Lam and Peng were put up in neigh­bour­ing rooms to serve their 14-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“I could hear him ex­er­cis­ing, he brought lots of equip­ment,” says Lam.</p>
    <p>Like all of his pre­vi­ous films with Peng, The Res­cue was phys­i­cally de­mand­ing to shoot, re­quir­ing a six-month train­ing pe­riod in which Peng mas­tered the abil­ity to hold his breath un­der­wa­ter for three min­utes.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor says that while movie shoots are never easy, The Res­cue is the first one where he “felt fear”.</p>
    <p>He did not give de­tails, but Lam re­veals that Peng al­most drowned while shoot­ing a scene i n the wa­ter, after a wire on his body be­came trapped in a ma­chine used to gen­er­ate large waves.</p>
    <p>“He was pulled 6m i nto the wa­ter. Of course we had re­spon­ders on hand but, by the time they got to him, he had drunk some wa­ter,” Lam re­calls.</p>
    <p>“Thank­fully he was re­ally calm and did not panic and that helped him to stay safe.”</p>
    <p>That was hardly the only har­row­ing ex­pe­ri­ence on the set.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese ac­tor Wang Yan­lin also briefly lost his hear­ing due to a dras­tic dif­fer­ence in ear pressure after film­ing scenes un­der­wa­ter and high in the air.</p>
    <p>Lam says: “I sent him to the best doc­tors in Hong Kong. I was so scared he would have some per­ma­nent dam­age, but thank good­ness he re­cov­ered.”</p>
    <p>Peng says he has al­ways en­joyed chal­leng­ing him­self and push­ing his body to its lim­its for Lam’s films. It is a trait shared by the char­ac­ter he plays – a front-line res­cuer.</p>
    <p>“We’re both peo­ple who love our jobs very much. I love act­ing and give it my all while (my char­ac­ter) loves the adren­a­line rush of go­ing on mis­sions and is will­ing to put his life on the line for oth­ers,” he says.</p>
    <p>The tough train­ing and stunts aside, Peng says what also stood out for him was learn­ing about the lives of real peo­ple on the China Res­cue and Sal­vage team.</p>
    <p>He adds: “A lot of the time, mis­sions sim­ply can­not be com­pleted be­cause of the nat­u­ral cir­cum­stances. Some­times, it’s just not pos­si­ble to res­cue ev­ery­body. That men­tal chal­lenge is a daily re­al­ity for them.”</p>
    <p>The Res­cue opened against com­pe­ti­tion from Won­der Woman 1984, which was also re­leased this month. But so far, it is beat­ing the Hol­ly­wood block­buster in China, where the lat­ter has re­ported dis­ap­point­ing box-of­fice tak­ings.</p>
    <p>Lam says: “They’re both films about he­roes. Won­der Woman 1984 is about a fic­tional hero­ine, while ours is about real-life ev­ery­day he­roes.”</p>
