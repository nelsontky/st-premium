    <p>With be­lea­guered Hyflux now un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment, chances are higher that the 34,000 re­tail in­vestors of its per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares may well end up with noth­ing if no vi­able deal is struck and the com­pany goes into liq­ui­da­tion.</p>
    <p>But a num­ber are al­ready re­signed to this worst-case sce­nario, given that the man­age­ment-led re­struc­tur­ing of the wa­ter treat­ment firm has yielded no deal so far, even as the group’s re­main­ing value con­tin­ues to dis­si­pate.</p>
    <p>Most are dis­ap­pointed by the pal­try re­cov­ery rates of­fered by white knights: The lat­est from Amer­i­can fund man­ager Strate­gic Growth In­vest­ments rep­re­sents a re­cov­ery of four cents on the dol­lar for re­tail in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Many want their pound of flesh and are watch­ing what ju­di­cial man­ager Bor­relli Walsh’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the Hyflux board and ad­vis­ers will flush out. Some say they sleep bet­ter now after founder Olivia Lum and the rest of the board were re­lieved of their author­ity with the ju­di­cial man­ager’s ap­point­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Hyflux and its cur­rent and for­mer di­rec­tors are the sub­jects of an on­go­ing probe by reg­u­la­tors into the com­pany for sus­pected false and mis­lead­ing state­ments and breaches of dis­clo­sure rules. As the probe in­ten­si­fies, ques­tions are be­ing raised over whether the re­struc­tur­ing had been con­ducted prop­erly and if the board dealt with so-called white-knight in­vestors Aqua Munda and Pi­son In­vest­ments on an “arm’s length ba­sis”.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Eddee Ng asked at a High Court hear­ing on Mon­day why Pi­son and Aqua Munda’s of­fers are con­tin­gent on no ju­di­cial man­age­ment be­ing in place and why the ex­ist­ing board should re­main when it is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng rep­re­sents the un­se­cured work­ing group (UWG) of 19 banks. They hold more than $931 mil­lion of Hyflux debt and pe­ti­tioned for the com­pany to be placed un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Pi­son and Aqua Munda have “sim­ply of­fered to ac­quire Hyflux’s se­nior debt, while re­fus­ing to out­line their in­ten­tions for the com­pany (or other cred­i­tor groups) un­til they have ac­quired that debt”, said Debtwire le­gal an­a­lyst Ash­ley Bell. “The UWG con­sid­ers both pro­pos­als un­set­tling” be­cause of a “lack of con­fir­ma­tion that the bid­ders have no af­fil­i­a­tion with Hyflux or its man­age­ment”, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bell also noted that the “terms of the bid­ders’ in­vi­ta­tion mem­o­ran­dums are al­most iden­ti­cal, with both in­volv­ing a re­verse Dutch auc­tion, which is geared to­wards min­imis­ing re­turns to cred­i­tors by re­quir­ing them to bid each other down. This is in con­trast to the pri­mary ob­jec­tive – the max­imi­sa­tion of cred­i­tor re­cov­er­ies”.</p>
    <p>Some cred­i­tors pointed to in­ad­e­quate cred­i­tor con­sul­ta­tion, in­suf­fi­cient fi­nan­cial dis­clo­sure, and value de­struc­tion of the group’s re­main­ing as­sets over the past 21/ years of re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>But even at this late stage, ju­di­cial man­age­ment would en­sure that a more trans­par­ent in­vestor-search process is un­der­taken and po­ten­tial claims against man­age­ment and third par­ties are in­ves­ti­gated, Mr Bell said.</p>
    <p>Gib­son Dunn part­ner Rob­son Lee said the first pri­or­ity is to es­tab­lish Hyflux’s fi­nan­cial po­si­tion and come up with a pro­posal to re­sus­ci­tate the com­pany via a pro­posed scheme of ar­range­ment. Bor­relli Walsh is ex­pected to pro­vide an in­terim re­port and costs sched­ule in the week of Dec 14.</p>
    <p>Given that it has been ad­vis­ing the UWG, get­ting up to speed should not be a prob­lem, ob­servers say. A big­ger chal­lenge could be get­ting an in­vestor with terms that all the cred­i­tors, par­tic­u­larly the bond hold­ers, are pre­pared to ac­cept.</p>
    <p>“While cer­tain stake­hold­ers have ques­tioned its in­de­pen­dence, the court has stated that it is pre­pared to ap­point an­other firm to act as joint man­agers,” Mr Lee noted.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial man­age­ment is Hyflux’s last chance to turn around be­fore liq­ui­da­tion. That Bor­relli Walsh has been ap­proached by in­vestors, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore-listed de­vel­oper OUE and Kep­pel In­fra­struc­ture Trust, even be­fore it was ap­pointed au­gurs well.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel said in a Sept 21 let­ter that it had “an in­ter­est in ex­plor­ing in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in the busi­ness and as­sets of Hyflux and (SingSpring) with Bor­relli Walsh”, Bor­relli Walsh man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Cosimo Bor­relli noted.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel con­firmed it had “a sig­nif­i­cant amount of liq­uid­ity and ac­cess to ad­di­tional re­sources given its net cash po­si­tion... and is there­fore able to move quickly”, he said in court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>While there’s no clear ev­i­dence that these new pro­pos­als will yield bet­ter re­sults, with many cred­i­tors hav­ing lost con­fi­dence in the board, a re­struc­tur­ing led by a ju­di­cial man­ager may get more trac­tion.</p>
