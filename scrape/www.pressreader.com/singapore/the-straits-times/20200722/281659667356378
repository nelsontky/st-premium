    <p>A vac­cine j ointly de­vel­oped by Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and United States phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics has re­ceived ap­proval for clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>This puts it with 24 other can­di­date vac­cines around the world that are cur­rently un­der­go­ing clin­i­cal eval­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of the school’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious diseases pro­gramme, pre­vi­ously told The Straits Times vac­cine tri­als “ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions” and could po­ten­tially re­sult in hu­man tri­als be­ing brought for­ward from Septem­ber to next month.</p>
    <p>But in a joint state­ment last night, the two or­gan­i­sa­tions said Singapore’s Health Sciences Au­thor­ity has given them the ap­proval to pro­ceed, and they would be­gin dos­ing hu­mans with the vac­cine, known as Lu­nar-Cov19, as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said yes­ter­day that pre­clin­i­cal stud­ies of the vac­cine have shown “very promis­ing find­ings”, in­clud­ing the pos­si­bil­ity that a sin­gle dose might be suf­fi­cient to trig­ger a ro­bust and durable im­mune re­sponse against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>He said: “We are very ea­ger to start the first-in-hu­man clin­i­cal trial here in Singapore and ad­vance Lu­nar-Cov19 on its jour­ney to be­com­ing a po­ten­tial com­mer­cial vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>Lu­nar-Cov19 con­tains ge­netic ma­te­rial called mRNA, which en­codes part of the virus. In­jected into a per­son, it causes the body’s cells to be­gin man­u­fac­tur­ing a pro­tein sim­i­lar to that of the virus, al­low­ing the body to recog­nise and learn to fight it.</p>
    <p>The first study will in­volve 108 healthy adult vol­un­teers of var­i­ous ages, and will be done to eval­u­ate dose lev­els. A fol­low-up study will be con­ducted to eval­u­ate the safety and tol­er­a­bil­ity of the vac­cine, and the ex­tent and du­ra­tion of the body’s im­mune re­sponses.</p>
    <p>Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive Joseph Payne said: “We are ex­cited to ad­vance this promis­ing vac­cine can­di­date into clin­i­cal tri­als.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Thomas M. Coff­man, dean of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, said: “There is a tremen­dous global im­per­a­tive to de­velop ef­fec­tive pre­ven­tive mea­sures for Covid-19 in­fec­tions. We are heart­ened by the rapid and promis­ing progress in our vac­cine col­lab­o­ra­tion with Arc­turus as we move for­ward into clin­i­cal tri­als.”</p>
    <p>There has been a global race to de­velop a vac­cine for the coro­n­avirus, which many see as a key re­quire­ment to re­sum­ing global travel and re­open­ing borders.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, aside from the 25 can­di­date vac­cines in clin­i­cal eval­u­a­tion, there were around 140 oth­ers in pre-clin­i­cal stages.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some ex­perts ear­lier warned that there is lit­tle chance of mass dis­tri­bu­tion of a 100 per cent ef­fec­tive vac­cine in the near future, and urged people to take safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures se­ri­ously.</p>
