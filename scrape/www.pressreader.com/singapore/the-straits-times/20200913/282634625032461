    <p>In con­ver­sa­tions, 27-year- old psy­chol­ogy ma­jor Ja­son Chua may ap­pear a fo­cused and con­fi­dent in­di­vid­ual who knows ex­actly what he wants, but be­lieve it or not, there was a time he was un­sure about his job op­tions and the path his ca­reer would take.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on his ear­lier days of em­ploy­ment at a re­cruit­ment agency, Mr Chua re­mem­bers how his work in­volved gen­eral rou­tine – con­duct­ing screen­ings and phone calls, draft­ing con­tract de­tails and schedul­ing in­ter­views, for ev­ery­one from stu­dents look­ing for part-time hol­i­day jobs, to tech­ni­cians look­ing for places in com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>It was good work, but he was itch­ing for more.</p>
    <p>He was in the of­fice one day when he chanced upon an ad­ver­tise­ment for a po­si­tion sup­ported by Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG)’s Ca­reer Trial, a pro­gramme that en­cour­ages in­di­vid­u­als look­ing for em­ploy­ment to take on short-term tri­als with em­ploy­ers to as­sess their job fit. It does so by pro­vid­ing train­ing al­lowances and in­cen­tives to par­tic­i­pat­ing in­di­vid­u­als, and salar y sup­port to em­ploy­ers who then may de­cide to hire Ca­reer Trial par­tic­i­pants for a full-time role af ter.</p>
    <p>The ad was for the role of HR Ex­ec­u­tive at ACP Com­puter Train­ing & Con­sul­tancy Pte Ltd, an es­tab­lished SME in the in­for­ma­tion, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and tech­nol­ogy field. Fit­tingly, it came just while he was con­tem­plat­ing a ca­reer tran­si­tion and think­ing about what his next ca­reer move should be.</p>
    <p>“I was just 14 months into my first job and felt that this was a good op­por tu­nit y to fur ther utilise my skills”, Mr Chua re­called. “The eightweek Ca­reer Trial seemed like a pos­i­tive step for ward,” he added.</p>
    <p>What drew him to the Ca­reer Trial of­fered by ACP was that the scope dur­ing the trial pe­riod would go be­yond re­cruit­ing, to in­clude re­ten­tion and re­train­ing as­pects as well.</p>
    <p>So for a pe­riod of eight weeks, Mr Chua em­barked on his Ca­reer Trial, grate­ful that ACP had agreed to give him the op­por­tu­nity to try out the role, which he oth­er­wise might not have had the ex­pe­ri­ence to qual­ify for.</p>
    <p>“What I like about Ca­reer Trial is that it gives you an op­por­tu­nity to try out a role which you may not have oth­er­wise qual­i­fied for,” Mr Chua said.</p>
    <p>The learn­ing curve, Mr Chua re­counted, was ini­tially ver y steep, es­pe­cially since he was the only ded­i­cated HR of­fi­cer in the com­pany. He con­fessed that he was at a loss when he first started. “I could iden­tify what needed to be done, but I did not al­ways have the so­lu­tions for them,” he ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>But he was grate­ful for the men­tor­ship, and ad­vice from his su­pe­ri­ors and peers alike. “I needed help on fos­ter­ing good em­ployee re­la­tion­ships, but I couldn’t just re­fer to the em­ployee hand­book,” he re­called.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing his ad­just­ment at the work­place as “dif­fi­cult but not im­pos­si­ble”, Mr Chua said his col­leagues were al­ways sup­port­ive and helped make his tran­si­tion seam­less.</p>
    <p>Upon com­ple­tion of the Ca­reer Trial, Mr Chua felt a great sense of mas­tery, sat­is­fac­tion and ac­com­plish­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, his em­ploy­ers had pos­i­tive things to say about him, as well as the Ca­reer Trial pro­gramme. Ms Teo Mei Ling, Gen­eral Man­ager of ACP and Mr Chua’s im­me­di­ate re­port­ing of­fi­cer, found him flu­ent in his com­mu­ni­ca­tion and adap­tive to the com­pany’s work­ing cul­ture from the out­set. She also liked his pos­i­tive at­ti­tude and ready ac­cep­tance of newly-as­signed tasks.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo found Ca­reer Trial to be a good scheme that al­lowed ACP to gauge Mr Chua’s cre­den­tials and ca­pa­bil­ity, while he took time to fit into the work­ing en­vi­ron­ment – a “win-win propo­si­tion” for both.</p>
    <p>“Ca­reer Trial al­lowed us to gauge Mr Chua’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties while he took time to as­sess his own fit in the work­ing en­vi­ron­ment. We’re happy that through this pro­gramme, we found him a suit­able can­di­date to join our fam­ily,” said Ms Teo Mei Ling, Gen­eral Man­ager, ACP Com­puter Train­ing & Con­sul­tancy Pte. Ltd.</p>
    <p>On what the most im­por­tant skills in his cur­rent role were, Mr Chua cited the abil­ity to stay calm un­der pres­sure, and hav­ing good com­mu­ni­ca­tion and peo­ple skills.</p>
    <p>He is care­ful not to let emo­tions get to him, even if in­ter­ac­tions with em­ploy­ees on em­ploy­ment mat­ters be­come highly charged. “I need to keep in mind not to re­cip­ro­cate with the same emo­tion if they are an­gry – to be pro­fes­sional in my re­sponse,” stated Mr Chua.</p>
    <p>On good com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills, Mr Chua saw the HR role as piv­otal, since their in­struc­tions carry much weight. There­fore, com­mu­ni­ca­tion he con­cluded, needs to be trans­par­ent, ef­fec­tive and ef­fi­cient at all times.</p>
    <p>His ad­vice to those who want to take a stab at Ca­reer Trial?</p>
    <p>“Stay hum­ble and be will­ing to learn from oth­ers – es­pe­cially from those who are vastly more ex­pe­ri­enced. Ev­ery­thing has to start from some­where.”</p>
