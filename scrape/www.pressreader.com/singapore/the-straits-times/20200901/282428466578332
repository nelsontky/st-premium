    <p>As hu­mil­i­a­tion goes, Fer­rari’s at Spa-Fran­cor­champs on Sun­day was as ex­cru­ci­at­ingly em­bar­rass­ing as it gets.</p>
    <p>At the Bel­gian Grand Prix, the faces in the camp were as red as the fa­mous scar­let livery. Many cars passed the Fer­raris, ei­ther as Charles Le­clerc’s des­per­ate gam­ble to start on the soft Pirellis earned him an early eighth place be­fore he slipped back or when be­ing repassed by cars that had com­pleted pit stops.</p>
    <p>Even with the DRS (Drag Re­duc­tion Sys­tem) rear wing ac­ti­vated, Le­clerc wasn’t able to pass any­one on the very long straight from the famed Eau Rouge to the Les Combes cor­ner.</p>
    <p>But, far, far worse than that, the cars from Maranello were hum­bled on that very straight by the Alfa Romeo of for­mer Fer­rari champion Kimi Raikko­nen, and the Haas of Ro­main Gros­jean. Cars that are also pow­ered by ex­actly the same en­gine.</p>
    <p>And yet, just a year ago, Le­clerc and Se­bas­tian Vet­tel qual­i­fied first and sec­ond at Spa, and Le­clerc beat Lewis Hamil­ton’s Mercedes to vic­tory be­fore fol­low­ing up again with a win on home ter­ri­tory at Monza. Vet­tel won in Sin­ga­pore. So what has gone wrong?</p>
    <p>The fact that the Alfa Romeo and the Haas blew the Fer­raris away gives some cred­i­bil­ity to team boss Mat­tia Binotto’s con­tention that it isn’t all down to the re­vised en­gine that the FIA in­sisted Fer­rari run this year, fol­low­ing ac­cu­sa­tions that they were run­ning out­side the reg­u­la­tions at times last year.</p>
    <p>But you’d be hard-pressed to find many F1 in­sid­ers who don’t be­lieve the prob­lem is fun­da­men­tally power unit-re­lated.</p>
    <p>Of course, thanks to the FIA’s se­cret set­tle­ment with Fer­rari late last year, we will never know the truth of what Fer­rari were do­ing, but while Binotto claims they were not found guilty of any wrong­do­ing, they have clearly been pe­nalised.</p>
    <p>The stop­watch doesn’t lie, and at Spa it showed on sheer pace Le­clerc had lost 14 places com­pared to last year.</p>
    <p>The truth is the Scud­e­ria are in com­plete tur­moil, with the loss of en­gine power denying them the chance to run more down­force and thus leav­ing the cars aero­dy­nam­i­cally com­pro­mised and very edgy to drive.</p>
    <p>And with an en­gine freeze in­tro­duced by the FIA un­til 2022, even Fer­rari chief ex­ec­u­tive Louis Camil­leri ac­knowl­edges it is un­likely they can be com­pet­i­tive again be­fore then.</p>
    <p>In­evitably, there will be some who be­lieve that Fer­rari’s en­forced down­fall is some­how bad for the sport, that it is help­ing to pro­mote bor­ing races in which the Mercedes usu­ally run away and hide.</p>
    <p>But last year, Red Bull made a bet­ter fist of things than did Fer­rari, and this year, their Honda-pow­ered RB16 beat the Mercedes fair and square in the 70th An­niver­sary GP at Sil­ver­stone.</p>
    <p>And much store is be­ing placed on the ban on “party mode” en­gine set­tings, as the FIA has said from Monza later this week all teams must run the same en­gine set­tings in qual­i­fy­ing as they will in the race, do­ing away with the abil­ity of some man­u­fac­tur­ers – read Mercedes – be­ing able to tweak their power more than oth­ers for qual­i­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>The hope is this will level the play­ing field, and in­deed it may al­low Red Bull to match the Mercedes in qual­i­fy­ing and thus have a bet­ter chance of racing them. Let us hope that it achieves that aim.</p>
    <p>But even if it does pro­mote more ex­cit­ing racing, it is un­likely that it will do any­thing to save Fer­rari from an­other pound­ing on their home turf at Monza this Sun­day or again the fol­low­ing week at Mugello in the Tus­can GP, which will be the Pranc­ing Horse’s 1,000th Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Lotto-Soudal rider Caleb Ewan of Aus­tralia win­ning the third stage yes­ter­day to claim his fourth stage vic­tory over­all.</p>
    <p>In­evitably there will be some who be­lieve that Fer­rari’s en­forced down­fall is some­how bad for the sport, that it is help­ing to pro­mote bor­ing races in which the Mercedes usu­ally run away and hide.</p>
