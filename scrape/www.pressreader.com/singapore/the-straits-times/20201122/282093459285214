    <p>Ratha Kr­ish­nan Sel­vaku­mar had in­flated the monthly salaries of var­i­ous for­eign work­ers whom he em­ployed in a com­pany he owned, when ap­ply­ing to the Min­istry of Man­power for their work passes... As a mem­ber of Sri Veera­makaliamma­n Tem­ple’s gov­ern­ing board, he over­saw its daily op­er­a­tions and was one of three peo­ple au­tho­rised to con­duct fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions on its be­half.</p>
    <p>A man dis­qual­i­fied as sec­re­tary of a Hindu tem­ple for be­ing con­victed of of­fences in­volv­ing el­e­ments of dis­hon­esty was fined $7,000 in court for con­tin­u­ing to play the role for over a year.</p>
    <p>Ratha Kr­ish­nan Sel­vaku­mar, 65, had pleaded guilty on Thurs­day to one count of act­ing as a board mem­ber of a char­ity de­spite be­ing dis­qual­i­fied.</p>
    <p>He was a key board mem­ber of Sri Veera­makaliamma­n Tem­ple, a reg­is­tered char­ity lo­cated in Seran­goon Road that, in 2018, was found by the Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties (COC) to have been mis­man­aged.</p>
    <p>On May 9, 2017, Sel­vaku­mar was con­victed of 10 of­fences and fined $80,000.</p>
    <p>He had in­flated the monthly salaries of var­i­ous for­eign work­ers whom he em­ployed in a com­pany he owned, when ap­ply­ing to the Min­istry of Man­power for their work passes.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Char­i­ties Act, any per­son who has been con­victed of of­fences such as fraud, cor­rup­tion, bribery and de­cep­tion is dis­qual­i­fied from act­ing in the ca­pac­ity of a gov­ern­ing board mem­ber, key of­fi­cer or trustee of any char­ity.</p>
    <p>Sel­vaku­mar, who was ap­pointed as sec­re­tary of the tem­ple in 2011, is be­lieved to be the first per­son pros­e­cuted for the of­fence since the Act was amended in 2018.</p>
    <p>As a mem­ber of the tem­ple’s gov­ern­ing board, he over­saw its daily op­er­a­tions and was one of three peo­ple au­tho­rised to con­duct fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions on its be­half.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his con­vic­tion, Sel­vaku­mar con­tin­ued to act as the tem­ple’s sec­re­tary, and was even paid $10,450 monthly from July 2017.</p>
    <p>His stint ended on April 30, 2018, when the COC barred key board mem­bers of the tem­ple – in­clud­ing Sel­vaku­mar – from their posts af­ter an eight-month probe found</p>
    <p>“se­vere mis­man­age­ment” in how its money was man­aged.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment is­sued then, the com­mis­sioner noted that an in­quiry found a “se­vere lack of care and pru­dence” by key board mem­bers as guardians of the tem­ple’s char­i­ta­ble as­sets be­tween Jan­uary 2011 and July 2014, with in­ter­nal con­trols nearly “non-ex­is­tent”.</p>
    <p>Such be­hav­iour had put the tem­ple’s funds and as­sets at risk.</p>
    <p>The probe found many in­stances where pay­ments given by the tem­ple were not ad­e­quately sub­stan­ti­ated with suf­fi­cient sup­port­ing doc­u­ments. Th­ese pay­ments ex­ceeded $500,000.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Sel­vaku­mar had ten­dered a res­ig­na­tion let­ter to the tem­ple on May 7, 2018.</p>
    <p>District Judge Carol Ling also took into con­sid­er­a­tion one sim­i­lar charge dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>For his of­fence, Sel­vaku­mar could have been jailed for up to three years and/or fined up to $10,000.</p>
