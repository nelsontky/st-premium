    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has said it would not back down from a plan to ban new US down­loads of the pop­u­lar video-shar­ing app TikTok, set­ting up a court show­down ahead of to­day’s dead­line.</p>
    <p>A Jus­tice Depart­ment court fil­ing on Friday said it op­poses TikTok’s pe­ti­tion for an in­junc­tion to block the or­der from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who has called the Chi­nese-owned so­cial plat­form a na­tional se­cu­rity risk.</p>
    <p>US District Judge Carl Ni­chols set a hear­ing for 9am to­day in Wash­ing­ton (9.30pm Sin­ga­pore time) for TikTok’s re­quest to block the Pres­i­dent’s or­der be­fore it takes ef­fect at 11.59pm.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment lawyers said they wanted to file a brief “un­der seal”, which would not be avail­able as a pub­lic record, cit­ing na­tional se­cu­rity and con­fi­den­tial busi­ness in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The court fil­ing said TikTok had ten­ta­tively agreed to sealed briefs but would re­serve the right to re­quest that some doc­u­ments be made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>TikTok has ar­gued that a ban, even if tem­po­rary, could cause ir­repara­ble harm to the videoshar­ing ap­pli­ca­tion, which has some 100 mil­lion users across the United States.</p>
    <p>Judge Ni­chols, who sits on the bench in Wash­ing­ton, said on Thurs­day that he dis­agreed with gov­ern­ment lawyers’ claims that the ban – which would not im­me­di­ately pre­vent us­age of TikTok but pre­vent down­loads by new users and up­dates – “merely pre­serves the sta­tus quo”.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts also pointed out that any ban could pre­vent users from down­load­ing up­dates and se­cu­rity patches for TikTok.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Mr Trump cited na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns and is­sued or­ders to ban both TikTok and the pop­u­lar Chi­nese app WeChat. The ban on WeChat has been put on hold in a sep­a­rate court case in Cal­i­for­nia. But the TikTok or­der stops short of a full ban un­til Nov 12, giv­ing the firm’s Chi­nese par­ent firm ByteDance time to con­clude a deal to trans­fer own­er­ship of the app.</p>
    <p>A ten­ta­tive deal un­veiled last week­end would make Sil­i­con Val­ley giant Or­a­cle the tech­nol­ogy part­ner for TikTok and a stake­holder in a new en­tity to be known as TikTok Global.</p>
