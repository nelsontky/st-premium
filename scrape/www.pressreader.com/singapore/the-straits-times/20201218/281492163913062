    <p>Two men who were the last to be seen with their school­mate be­fore she went miss­ing for 13 years are now ac­cused of mur­der­ing her.</p>
    <p>Ah­mad Danial Mo­hamed Rafa’ee, 35, one of the two, was charged in court yes­ter­day with the mur­der of Ms Fe­li­cia Teo Wei Ling on June 30, 2007.</p>
    <p>He and Ragil Pu­tra Se­tia Suk­marah­jana, 32, al­legedly mur­dered Ms Teo, then 19, be­tween 1.39am and 7.20am in a 10th-floor unit of Block 19 Marine Ter­race, said court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The two men are be­lieved to have been the last to see Ms Teo when she went to the flat that night, said the po­lice in a state­ment yes­ter­day. The three are said to have been friends, and stud­ied at Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts, ac­cord­ing to their on­line pro­files.</p>
    <p>A be­spec­ta­cled Ah­mad Danial – who wore his hair long, had ear pierc­ings and was hand­cuffed – ap­peared in court via a video link.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said Ah­mad Danial was ar­rested on Tues­day. They are search­ing for Ragil Pu­tra Se­tia, who they be­lieve is not in Sin­ga­pore. They are also look­ing for Ms Teo’s re­mains.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times, a close friend of Ms Teo’s who de­clined to be named said he, to­gether with Ms Teo’s friends and fam­ily, had mounted an ex­ten­sive search for her af­ter she van­ished.</p>
    <p>They strongly be­lieved that she had not run away, con­trary to what ne­ti­zens said, and her mother lodged a miss­ing per­sons re­port on July 3 that year.</p>
    <p>They con­ducted their own in­ves­ti­ga­tions, even go­ing to the ex­tent of ap­proach­ing Ms Teo’s telco provider to re­trieve her phone records.</p>
    <p>They also con­stantly mon­i­tored her so­cial me­dia ac­counts, said the friend, adding that he had been frus­trated with the lack of progress in in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Af­ter slightly over a year of search­ing, Ms Teo’s par­ents en­cour­aged him to “move on with life”, said the friend. “Her fam­ily re­ally wanted me to live my own life. I’m very sure her mum was still hope­ful to the end,” he added.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they had clas­si­fied the case as a miss­ing per­sons case in 2007, as they had found no facts to link the two men to Ms Teo’s dis­ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>Both men had main­tained to po­lice that Ms Teo left the flat in the wee hours of June 30 that year.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they con­ducted ex­ten­sive in­ves­ti­ga­tions, in­clud­ing search­ing the flat and check­ing closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage in the vicin­ity, but did not find any­thing in­crim­i­nat­ing.</p>
    <p>The po­lice ex­plained that they reg­u­larly re­view un­solved miss­ing per­sons cases for fur­ther leads.</p>
    <p>In­ter­views with Ms Teo’s fam­ily and other wit­nesses were con­ducted dur­ing reg­u­lar re­views.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also checked on Ms Teo’s bank ac­counts, e-mails and so­cial me­dia plat­forms to see if there were new dig­i­tal foot­prints.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a re­view in July this year, Ms Teo’s case was re­ferred to the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion De­part­ment (CID), “given that the case has been un­solved for an ex­tended pe­riod of time”, said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>The po­lice added that this is part of a process where se­lected cases that have been out­stand­ing for a pro­tracted pe­riod of time are sur­faced to the CID for re­view.</p>
    <p>A break­through came af­ter the CID un­cov­ered new leads while trac­ing the be­long­ings that were be­lieved to be in Ms Teo’s pos­ses­sion when she was re­ported miss­ing, said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Me­dia re­ports then said Ms Teo had her mo­bile phone and lap­top with her, among other items, when she van­ished.</p>
    <p>The CID man­aged to link one of her be­long­ings to Ah­mad Danial.</p>
    <p>More than 200 peo­ple had been in­volved in the hunt for Ms Teo in 2007. They dis­trib­uted fliers, ran ad­ver­tise­ments in news­pa­pers, and combed ar­eas like Gey­lang, Yishun and Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>Founder of Crime Li­brary Sin­ga­pore Joseph Tan said his or­gan­i­sa­tion has con­tin­ued with the search ever since Ms Teo’s par­ents ap­proached them in 2007.</p>
    <p>“I’m glad that there’s some clo­sure, but words can­not de­scribe how sad this case is, es­pe­cially since it was over 13 years,” said Mr Tan, who last spoke to the fam­ily a few months ago to check in on them.</p>
    <p>Ah­mad Danial has been re­manded for in­ves­ti­ga­tions. If con­victed of mur­der, he faces the death sen­tence.</p>
