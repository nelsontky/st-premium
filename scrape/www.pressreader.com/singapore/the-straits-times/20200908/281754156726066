    <p>LON­DON • The rise in Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Bri­tain is “con­cern­ing”, Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock said yes­ter­day, but he added that the gov­ern­ment was “still in con­trol” of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The daily num­ber of Covid-19 cases jumped on Sun­day to 2,988, the high­est daily rise since May.</p>
    <p>“The rise in the num­ber of cases we’ve seen in the last few days is largely among younger peo­ple,” Mr Han­cock told LBC Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Asked if the gov­ern­ment had lost con­trol, he said: “No, but the whole coun­try needs to fol­low the so­cial dis­tanc­ing be­cause we can only do this as a whole so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>He added that the rise was preva­lent among younger peo­ple – those un­der 25 – from more af­flu­ent back­grounds, warn­ing that the United King­dom risks fol­low­ing Euro­pean coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a new wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion rates in France and Spain show peo­ple can­not af­ford to re­lax, he said. “The prob­lem is that spread­ing the dis­ease among young peo­ple leads to older peo­ple get­ting it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Avoid­ing a wave of in­fec­tions that could trig­ger a new na­tional lock­down is crit­i­cal to Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s plan to kick­start the econ­omy, with min­is­ters re­it­er­at­ing that shut­ting down again must be a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>But while Mr Han­cock said the prospect of a vac­cine roll-out be­fore the end of the year is “look­ing up”, the “most likely” sce­nario is early next year, mean­ing that peo­ple must still obey so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules to re­duce trans­mis­sions. “We cer­tainly see cases where they are not, and then we take ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>The spike in cases un­der­mines the gov­ern­ment’s push to en­cour­age peo­ple to go back to their work­places af­ter schools re­opened across Eng­land last week.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­ment Sec­re­tary Ge­orge Eus­tice yes­ter­day said the gov­ern­ment wants to avoid a sec­ond na­tional lock­down “at all costs” – but would not rule one out.</p>
    <p>“What we’ve de­vel­oped since the orig­i­nal lock­down is much more tar­geted lo­cal lock­downs,” Mr Eus­tice told Sky News. “The idea of go­ing into a to­tal na­tional lock­down again is some­thing we don’t want to do. The im­pacts on our econ­omy are sig­nif­i­cant.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is also fac­ing pres­sure from the travel in­dus­try to carry out Covid-19 test­ing at air­ports to cut quar­an­tine time for trav­ellers. Mr Han­cock said he is work­ing on try­ing to re­duce the quar­an­tine pe­riod “as soon as it’s prac­ti­cal” but said it has to be “done in a way that keeps peo­ple safe”.</p>
