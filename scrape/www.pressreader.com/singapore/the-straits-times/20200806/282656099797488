    <p>SUN AND YOUNG GO SIGHT­SEE­ING: They were both wear­ing face masks, but fans recog­nised Stefanie Sun (left) and Char­lie Young (far left) all the same. On Tues­day, home-grown singer Sun posted pho­tos taken in Arab Street with Hong Kong ac­tress Young. Sun, who turned 42 last month, wrote in Chi­nese:</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing for places to go sight­see­ing.” Their lo­ca­tion was in­di­cated as Hjh Maimu­nah Res­tau­rant & Cater­ing in Arab Street.</p>
    <p>Even if fans could not recog­nise Young, there was a clue in the post – #they­oungchar­liey­oung was one of the hash­tags along with #gath­er­ing and #smiles­be­hindthe­masks. Sun also posted a pic­ture of the lunch (above) the duo and two other friends had at the res­tau­rant.</p>
    <p>Young, 46, is based in Sin­ga­pore with her Sin­ga­porean hus­band Khoo Shao Tze. The cou­ple have twin sons who are three years old. Sun, who cel­e­brates her 20th year in show busi­ness this year, is also a mother of two. She has a seven-year-old son and a two-year-old daugh­ter with her DutchIn­done­sian busi­ness­man hus­band Nadim van der Ros.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time Sun and Young have ap­peared in each other’s pho­tos. The ac­tress, known for her roles in movies such as The Lovers (1994),</p>
    <p>New Po­lice Story (2004) and Cold War (2012), posted sev­eral pho­tos of her­self with Sun on so­cial me­dia last month to mark Sun’s birth­day. She also ap­peared in Sun’s pho­tos in Oc­to­ber 2018 when they cel­e­brated a friend’s birth­day.</p>
