    <p>Su­per­mar­ket branch man­ager Mo­hamed Amin is un­able to for­get how items flew off the shelves in a wave of panic buy­ing af­ter the Dorscon (Dis­ease Out­break Re­sponse Sys­tem Con­di­tion) level was raised to or­ange in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Mr Amin, who has been man­ag­ing the FairPrice out­let at Block 135 Jurong Gate­way Road for three years, says: “Even from mid­night to 3am, in the early stages of Covid, there were still a lot of cus­tomers try­ing to avoid the crowd.”</p>
    <p>In the past few months, Mr Amin, 59, has helped to keep the store run­ning smoothly, over­see­ing tasks rang­ing from safe man­age­ment mea­sures to the or­gan­i­sa­tion of in­ven­tory and staff’s work sched­ules.</p>
    <p>He is among Sin­ga­pore­ans fea­tured in video in­ter­views in the Na­tional Day Pa­rade morn­ing tele­cast.</p>
    <p>Mr Amin man­ages a team of more than 50 peo­ple at the 24/7 out­let. He and his team have had to ad­just to numer­ous changes. They have put in longer hours to serve a larger vol­ume of cus­tomers and re­stock shelves with goods.</p>
    <p>His col­leagues’ ded­i­ca­tion has kept Mr Amin go­ing, even when fa­tigue set in. “When I see that my ju­nior staff can work so hard, I also want to do more.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic was also a les­son in lo­gis­tics. The team had to re­stock cer­tain es­sen­tial items twice a day, com­pared with just once a day be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They also have more du­ties, such as tem­per­a­ture-tak­ing and en­sur­ing that shop­pers keep a safe dis­tance.</p>
    <p>Mr Amin, who vis­ited the store even on his days off to over­see oper­a­tions in the out­break’s early stages, says: “We felt stressed at first, but we man­aged to over­come these chal­lenges with help from the man­age­ment, which sent a team from oper­a­tions and staff to help us.”</p>
    <p>The man­ager, who has been work­ing at FairPrice for over 35 years and was pre­vi­ously a store­keeper at other branches, is sat­is­fied when he is able to help cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>He re­calls an in­stance when he and his staff helped a lone el­derly shop­per to carry her gro­ceries, give her pri­or­ity in the queue and load the items into a taxi.</p>
    <p>“She says that with­out my help she would have had to wait for a long time. I felt happy for her, too.”</p>
    <p>When cus­tomers find that items are out of stock, he takes down their con­tact de­tails so he can in­form them when the stock ar­rives. This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant to shop­pers try­ing to limit their move­ment amid the pan­demic, he adds.</p>
    <p>“Some of our reg­u­lar cus­tomers live in Cle­menti but they still come here be­cause they are used to shop­ping here and talk­ing to us.”</p>
