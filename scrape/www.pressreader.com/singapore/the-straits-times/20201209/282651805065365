    <p>WHEN CARMAN MET JOEY: Hong Kong ac­tress Carman Lee (right, with scarf) has met many ac­tors and ac­tresses through­out her ca­reer, but one of those she re­mem­bers most fondly is for­mer ac­tress Joey Wong (far right, with hair in a pony­tail).</p>
    <p>Lee, 54, who is fa­mous for play­ing Lit­tle Dragon Girl in a 1995 TVB adap­ta­tion of The Re­turn Of The Con­dor Heroes, shared her mem­o­ries of Wong re­cently as she pro­moted her newly launched mem­oir, ti­tled Vel­vet Del­phinium.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, she posted two photos (both right) she took with Wong in 1989 as she plugged her book on Weibo.</p>
    <p>Lee wrote in Chi­nese: “I added two photos with Joey Wong spe­cially in the new book be­cause she was the first ac­tress I met in my life.</p>
    <p>“I was still a flight at­ten­dant in 1989 and filmed my first-ever show that year. I had the chance to film Killer’s Ro­mance to­gether with Si­mon Yam and Wong.” Lee had a small role as Wong’s class­mate in the 1990 ac­tion film and went on to act in sci­ence-fic­tion film The Wicked City (1992), which was pro­duced by Tsui Hark, be­fore quit­ting her job as a flight at­ten­dant to act full time.</p>
    <p>Lee said: “Wong had al­ready filmed A Chi­nese Ghost Story at that time, but she did not put on airs and was very friendly. We even chat­ted to­gether dur­ing breaks.”</p>
    <p>Wong fa­mously starred in the ro­man­tic hor­ror film A Chi­nese Ghost Story (1987) with the late Les­lie Che­ung. Now 53, Wong played fe­male ghost Nie Xiao­qian in the movie loosely based on a story from the Chi­nese clas­sic col­lec­tion of spooky tales, Strange Sto­ries From A Chi­nese Stu­dio.</p>
    <p>For her book, Lee in­vited Hong Kong ac­tor Louis Koo, 50, to write the fore­word. Koo acted as her dis­ci­ple and lover Yang Guo in the TVB drama, The Con­dor Heroes</p>
    <p>95.</p>
