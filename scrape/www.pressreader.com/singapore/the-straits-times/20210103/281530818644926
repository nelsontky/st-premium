    <p>To start the new year on a pos­i­tive note, here are some tips on how you can in­vest your money so that you can reap re­turns of be­tween $200,000 and $1 mil­lion for your re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>The best part is you do not even need to come up with a lot of cash to earn this amount, and you can start plan­ning for this in­vest­ment right now in your own home.</p>
    <p>No, this is not one of those “too good to be true” get-rich-quick schemes that you may come across on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>In­deed, this in­vest­ment is not only for all res­i­dents here, it is also the safest around be­cause it is pro­tected by the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>I am re­fer­ring to the ubiq­ui­tous Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF). Many peo­ple are still un­sure how to max­imise its full po­ten­tial to gen­er­ate good re­tire­ment in­come that will last them a life­time.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have had a love­hate re­la­tion­ship with the CPF. Those in the hate camp are res­o­lute in see­ing CPF as a “scam” by the Govern­ment to pre­vent them from with­draw­ing all their funds at age 55.</p>
    <p>As they detest re­ceiv­ing their pay­outs in “dribs and drabs” from 65, many have the mis­taken be­lief that they should de­plete their ac­counts as much as pos­si­ble, such as by us­ing all their el­i­gi­ble funds to pay for their hous­ing loan.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, since they can­not touch much of the money un­til 65, they think it is bet­ter to use CPF to pay their mort­gages, as this means they can have more cash now.</p>
    <p>But fans of CPF think other­wise – they are mostly savers and even savvy fi­nan­cial plan­ners who know how to use CPF’s abil­ity to gen­er­ate good re­turns for them­selves.</p>
    <p>It is not an ex­ag­ger­a­tion to say that CPF has been mak­ing mil­lion­aires out of or­di­nary work­ing-class Sin­ga­pore­ans who will get to en­joy ev­ery dol­lar that they put there, with hardly any risk of los­ing even a cent.</p>
    <p>Of course, such big re­turns will not ap­pear overnight – you need a life­time of pa­tience and some plan­ning to reap the re­wards.</p>
    <p>LIFE­LONG IN­COME FOR RE­TIRE­MENT</p>
    <p>There is a rea­son that Sin­ga­pore’s CPF is lauded as the best re­tire­ment scheme in Asia. CPF Life, its longevity an­nu­ity scheme, can pro­vide a rather sub­stan­tial monthly pay­out for life with a rel­a­tively low in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, those who turn 55 this year can set aside the En­hanced Re­tire­ment Sum (ERS) of $279,000 from ei­ther their CPF Spe­cial Ac­count (SA) or Or­di­nary Ac­count (OA) to en­joy a monthly pay­out of up to $2,300 from the age of 65.</p>
    <p>If they live un­til 85, they would have re­ceived about $550,000 in all, which means they would have al­most dou­bled their orig­i­nal amount and gained more than $270,000.</p>
    <p>At 90, they would have re­ceived a to­tal of about $690,000, or more than $410,000.</p>
    <p>Do not de­spair if you do not have enough for ERS – you can still aim for the Full Re­tire­ment Sum at $186,000, which will give you a monthly pay­out of up to $1,500, or the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum (BRS) at $93,000, which will give you a monthly pay­out of up to $800.</p>
    <p>Of course, when you set aside a lower amount for CPF Life, you will re­ceive lower re­turns than those who have put up the high­est sum.</p>
    <p>If you are still keen to earn more, the good news is that this in­vest­ment does not end at 55.</p>
    <p>You can con­tinue to top up the CPF Life re­tire­ment ac­count with ei­ther cash or your re­main­ing funds in CPF un­til you hit the ERS limit for the year.</p>
    <p>HOW TO GAIN MORE</p>
    <p>In the past few years, many savvy CPF fans have been proudly shar­ing their se­cret of how to “game” the CPF sys­tem by mak­ing use of its own rules to make more money.</p>
    <p>This is how one tip works:</p>
    <p>• A few months be­fore you reach 55, you will re­ceive a writ­ten no­tice from the CPF Board to in­form you of the CPF Life scheme and how you can ben­e­fit from it. Once you de­cide that you want to set aside the ERS, the to­tal sum of $279,000 will be de­ducted from your ex­ist­ing funds in the SA first. If you do not have enough, the re­main­ing sum will come from your OA.</p>
    <p>• You should know by now that money in the SA earns 4 per cent interest, while money in the OA earns 2.5 per cent. Of course, those seek­ing more re­turns would pre­fer that CPF deduct the ERS amount from the OA first, rather than the SA, but this is not how the cur­rent process works.</p>
    <p>• To cir­cum­vent the de­duc­tion from the SA, you can leave be­hind the manda­tory min­i­mum of $40,000 and in­vest the rest in a short-term and rel­a­tively safe in­vest­ment prod­uct ap­proved un­der the CPF In­vest­ment Scheme.</p>
    <p>• When the time for de­duc­tion comes, only the re­main­ing $40,000 in your SA will be de­ducted and the CPF Board has to deduct the rest of the sum for ERS from your OA.</p>
    <p>• Af­ter the de­duc­tion, you can cash out on your short-term in­vest­ment and all the money will then go back to your SA, which earns more interest.</p>
    <p>You may want to com­mend the per­son who first thought of this cre­ative plan to “hide money” from the de­duc­tion process so that mem­bers get to have more funds in their SA.</p>
    <p>But this plan comes with some risks, es­pe­cially if you are not a savvy in­vestor.</p>
    <p>First, you need to pick the right in­vest­ment prod­uct and pay the ap­pli­ca­ble fees even though you plan to park the SA funds for only a short time.</p>
    <p>Know that no mat­ter how safe a prod­uct is, there will still be risks of losses, es­pe­cially if a ma­jor cri­sis breaks out sud­denly.</p>
    <p>So it may not be worth your while just to earn ex­tra interest at 4 per cent. Do not for­get that if you leave your money un­touched in the OA, it still earns 2.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>SMARTER WAY TO GAIN PROFIT</p>
    <p>There is another CPF rule that you can make use of, so that you can leave more money in both the SA and OA. This is how you do it: • When it is your time to set aside your re­tire­ment sum, choose the low­est pos­si­ble tier – the BRS, which is $93,000 this year. • When the trans­fer date comes, only this amount will be de­ducted from your SA, leav­ing the rest of your funds in the SA in­tact. No money will be de­ducted from the OA.</p>
    <p>• Af­ter this hap­pens, you can “change your mind” and top up your re­tire­ment ac­count to hit ERS, but with cash. Why top up your re­tire­ment ac­count with cash and not CPF? It is not easy to find risk-free in­vest­ments that can give a yield of 2.5 per cent, let alone 4 per cent.</p>
    <p>• If you have ac­cu­mu­lated sub­stan­tial bal­ances in your OA and SA, this method al­lows you to en­joy the max­i­mum re­turns in CPF by keep­ing most of your ini­tial sums in­tact.</p>
    <p>If you con­tinue to leave all your money in CPF af­ter 55 and with­draw only spar­ingly, sub­stan­tial bal­ances can yield a re­turn of $500,000, if not more, by the time you hit 85, given the high interest rate.</p>
    <p>And to­gether with your re­turns from the CPF Life pay­outs, you can aim to hit $1 mil­lion. Af­ter all, we should pros­per as we live longer, and not get poorer, right?</p>
