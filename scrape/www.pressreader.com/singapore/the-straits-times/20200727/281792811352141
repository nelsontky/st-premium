    <p>MUM­BAI • Spurn­ing free air tick­ets, ac­com­mo­da­tion and higher pay, mil­lions of mi­grant work­ers who fled In­dia’s cities when the coronaviru­s hit are too scared to re­turn, with grim im­pli­ca­tions for the al­ready crum­bling econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant labour­ers form the back­bone of Asia’s third-largest econ­omy, toil­ing in ev­ery sec­tor from mak­ing con­sumer goods to stitch­ing gar­ments to driv­ing cabs.</p>
    <p>But when In­dia went into lock­down in late March, vast num­bers lost their jobs, prompt­ing a huge, heart-rend­ing ex­o­dus back to their home vil­lages, some­times on foot, their chil­dren in their arms.</p>
    <p>Some died on the way.</p>
    <p>Mum­bai’s swanky high-rises, for ex­am­ple, were built and largely staffed by peo­ple from poorer states such as Ut­tar Pradesh, Bi­har and Odisha, who worked as se­cu­rity guards, cooks and clean­ers.</p>
    <p>But as the city be­came a virus hot spot, around 80 per cent of con­struc­tion work­ers left the fi­nan­cial hub af­ter work came to a stand­still, ac­cord­ing to the Ma­ha­rash­tra Cham­ber of Hous­ing In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Four months on, with lock­down mea­sures eased, some work­ers have trick­led back, but more than 10,000 build­ing sites are ly­ing vir­tu­ally aban­doned due to se­vere labour short­ages across the city.</p>
    <p>“We are try­ing our best to bring back mi­grant work­ers, even go­ing to the ex­tent of giv­ing them air tick­ets, Covid-19 health in­sur­ance... (and) weekly check-ups by doc­tors,” said real es­tate de­vel­oper Ra­jesh Pra­jap­ati. “But it has not reaped any pos­i­tive signs yet.”</p>
    <p>TO NO AVAIL</p>
    <p>We are try­ing our best to bring back mi­grant work­ers, even go­ing to the ex­tent of giv­ing them air tick­ets, Covid-19 health in­sur­ance... (and) weekly check-ups by doc­tors.</p>
    <p>But it has not reaped any ’’ pos­i­tive signs yet.</p>
    <p>REAL ES­TATE DE­VEL­OPER</p>
    <p>RA­JESH PRA­JAP­ATI, on at­tempts to get mi­grant work­ers to re­turn to Mum­bai.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi said in a public ad­dress yes­ter­day that In­dia needs to be “ex­tra vig­i­lant” as the coronaviru­s threat per­sists. This was even as the coun­try reg­is­tered a record num­ber of pa­tient re­cov­er­ies in a day.</p>
    <p>The In­dian govern­ment said yes­ter­day that 36,145 pa­tients had re­cov­ered and been dis­charged in the last 24 hours, mark­ing a record num­ber of sin­gle-day re­cov­er­ies.</p>
    <p>“The danger of corona is far from be­ing over. At many places, it is spread­ing fast,” Mr Modi said. “We need to be ex­tra vig­i­lant.”</p>
    <p>Prop­erty gi­ant Hi­ranan­dani Group, which – un­usu­ally – con­tin­ued to pay its work­ers dur­ing the lock­down, has had more suc­cess, but has still man­aged to con­vince only around 30 per cent of its 4,500 work­ers to stay on site.</p>
    <p>The group’s bil­lion­aire co-founder Ni­ran­jan Hi­ranan­dani told Agence France-Presse: “We looked af­ter them, took care of their food, safety and sani­ti­sa­tion and even had mo­bile creches for kids.”</p>
    <p>With a colos­sal slump in growth ex­pected, Mr Modi’s govern­ment has steadily eased curbs on many busi­nesses even as coronaviru­s cases surge to­wards 1.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts say firms are still star­ing at a bleak fu­ture due to bat­tered fi­nances, stalled projects and, cru­cially, a lack of work­ers.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate de­mand has plum­meted by al­most 90 per cent in Mum­bai alone, with fall­ing sales and the lull in con­struc­tion se­verely tu­ral events will be sus­pended.</p>
    <p>The wear­ing of masks in public places in Danang is now com­pul­sory and gath­er­ings of more than 30 peo­ple in public places are banned, the govern­ment said.</p>
    <p>The de­tec­tion of the new cases, which comes as Viet­nam is seek­ing to re­vive its econ­omy and re­sume in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial flights, has prompted the au­thor­i­ties to step up a crack­down on il­le­gal im­mi­grants.</p>
    <p>Thanks to strict quar­an­tine mea­sures and an ag­gres­sive and wide­spread test­ing pro­gramme, Viet­nam has kept its virus to­tal to an im­pres­sively low 420 cases, with no deaths. af­fect­ing ac­cess to credit.</p>
    <p>“We have a dou­ble whammy with the pan­demic erod­ing de­mand while con­struc­tion work­ers are not avail­able,” Mr Pankaj Kapoor, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Mum­bai-based con­sul­tancy Li­ases Fo­ras, told AFP.</p>
    <p>“Credit flow from the lender has (also) stopped be­cause... credit dis­bur­sal is based on con­struc­tion progress and sales,” he added, pro­ject­ing the tur­moil to deepen.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness own­ers in other fields paint an equally grim picture.</p>
    <p>Mr Aseem Ku­mar, gen­eral-sec­re­tary of the Gar­ment Ex­porters As­so­ci­a­tion of Ra­jasthan, said his sec­tor was “in a mess”. The or­gan­i­sa­tion rep­re­sents 300 man­u­fac­tur­ers ex­port­ing cloth­ing to Ja­pan, the United States and Europe. Many have of­fered work­ers ac­com­mo­da­tion, in­sur­ance and a 20 per cent pay rise, but to lit­tle avail.</p>
    <p>“Most of the or­ders have been de­ferred to next sea­son as there are no labour­ers avail­able,” he said.</p>
