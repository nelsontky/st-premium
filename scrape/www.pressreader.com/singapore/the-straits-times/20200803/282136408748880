    <p>UNITED KING­DOM HIGH COURT JUS­TICE COLIN BIRSS</p>
    <p>A Lon­don court’s go-ahead for a con­tact­less card patent ap­pli­ca­tion to pro­ceed may see a new and bet­ter pay­ment de­vice in the mar­ket, if ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The de­vice ap­plied for by Len­ovo (Sin­ga­pore) al­lows the card reader to au­to­mat­i­cally choose from mul­ti­ple ac­counts be­long­ing to a sin­gle user to ef­fect pay­ment.</p>
    <p>The court in judg­ment grounds last month held that the card was dif­fer­ent from ex­ist­ing ar­range­ments where the user had to press but­tons to se­lect which card to use to pay for a sale.</p>
    <p>United King­dom High Court Jus­tice Colin Birss noted that the in­ven­tion re­lates to buy­ing things with con­tact­less pay­ment de­vices such as credit cards and deals with a prob­lem called “card clash”.</p>
    <p>This hap­pens when the wal­let pre­sented by a pur­chaser con­tains more than one card and the elec­tronic card reader is faced with which card it is sup­posed to read.</p>
    <p>“In the in­ven­tion, the user presents mul­ti­ple con­tact­less pay­ment de­vices to a reader, where each pay­ment de­vice (card) re­lates to a sep­a­rate pay­ment ac­count. The sys­tem au­to­mat­i­cally splits the pay­ment be­tween a plu­ral­ity of pay­ment ac­counts ac­cord­ing to one or more pre­set user pref­er­ences,” added the judge.</p>
    <p>The court found that the Len­ovo in­ven­tion is dif­fer­ent from a pre­vi­ous ap­pli­ca­tion where the user has to press a but­ton to choose which card to use or to split the pay­ment be­tween two cards.</p>
    <p>“In the Len­ovo in­ven­tion, this is han­dled au­to­mat­i­cally at the point of sale be­cause the user’s pref­er­ences have al­ready been ac­quired and stored else­where. As a re­sult of this au­to­matic fea­ture, the ‘card</p>
    <p>AU­TO­MATIC</p>
    <p>In the in­ven­tion, the user presents mul­ti­ple con­tact­less pay­ment de­vices to a reader, where each pay­ment de­vice (card) re­lates to a sep­a­rate pay­ment ac­count. The sys­tem au­to­mat­i­cally splits the pay­ment be­tween a plu­ral­ity of pay­ment ac­counts ac­cord­ing to one or more pre­set user pref­er­ences. clash’ prob­lem ex­pe­ri­enced with con­tact­less pay­ment cards is solved with­out the user hav­ing to take any ex­tra phys­i­cal step at the point they use their con­tact­less cards.</p>
    <p>“In my judg­ment, that dif­fer­ence is an ef­fect of the in­ven­tion which is nei­ther a com­puter pro­gram as such nor a method of do­ing busi­ness as such nor a com­bi­na­tion of the two.</p>
    <p>“The key ques­tion in this case is whether the in­ven­tion in­volves a dif­fer­ent phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion with the world out­side the com­puter, as com­pared to what had gone be­fore,” he added.</p>
    <p>Len­ovo (Sin­ga­pore) had ap­pealed to the court af­ter the UK Comptrolle­r of Patents ex­cluded its patent ap­pli­ca­tion last year un­der its Patents Act.</p>
    <p>Mr Martin Sch­weiger, Sin­ga­pore­based chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of patent at­tor­neys Sch­weiger & Part­ners, which rep­re­sented the case be­fore the UK In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Of­fice, said: “The case clar­i­fies what type of soft­ware can be patented in the UK. That was a ma­jor ob­sta­cle for man­u­fac­tur­ers seek­ing to sup­ply into the fifth big­gest econ­omy in the world: some 80 per cent of the in­ven­tions in our smart­phones are soft­ware in­ven­tions.”</p>
