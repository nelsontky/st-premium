    <p>There were 16 in­ci­dents of armed rob­bery in the Sin­ga­pore Strait from Jan­uary to June this year, com­pared with eight in the same pe­riod last year, mark­ing a five-year high. There was an in­crease in piracy and armed rob­bery cases in Asian wa­ters in the first half of the year, with 51 in­ci­dents com­pared with last year’s 28 for the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In­ci­dents of armed rob­bery re­ported in the Sin­ga­pore Strait have hit a five-year high.</p>
    <p>There were 16 in­ci­dents from Jan­uary to June this year, com­pared with eight in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the in­crease in piracy and armed rob­bery was no­table through­out Asian wa­ters in the first half of the year, with 51 re­ported in­ci­dents against 28 for the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The half-yearly statis­tics were re­leased by the Re­gional Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment on Com­bat­ing Piracy and Armed Rob­bery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) In­for­ma­tion Sharing Cen­tre on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>ReCAAP’s ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Masafumi Kuroki told re­porters in a vir­tual brief­ing that the cen­tre was con­cerned with the nearly twofold in­crease in the num­ber of in­ci­dents in Asia, even though most were at a “low sever­ity level”.</p>
    <p>“Small crimes, if not ad­dressed, can em­bolden crim­i­nals to com­mit more se­ri­ous acts,” he said.</p>
    <p>Most of the in­ci­dents in the Sin­ga­pore Strait this year oc­curred in the hours of dark­ness and in­volved bulk car­ri­ers, al­though tankers and tug boats were also tar­geted. Items stolen in­cluded en­gine spares, scrap metal and steel con­struc­tion ma­te­rial on barges.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of in­ci­dents in the Malacca and Sin­ga­pore straits has climbed steadily from one in the first half of 2016 to two in the fol­low­ing year and five in 2018.</p>
    <p>Asked about the in­crease in the num­ber of in­ci­dents, Mr Kuroki said the rea­sons were not clear, but there was a need for ships to en­hance their vig­i­lance and for law en­force­ment to strengthen sur­veil­lance and pa­trol.</p>
    <p>One bright spot was the ar­rest of three per­pe­tra­tors on a bulk car­rier by the In­done­sian Navy on March 16.</p>
    <p>The car­rier was about 6.8 nau­ti­cal miles east of Pu­lau Karimun Ke­cil, in In­done­sia, at about 5am, when the per­pe­tra­tors were sighted in the en­gine room and were de­tained by the crew. The crew mem­bers were not in­jured and noth­ing was stolen.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuroki said he hoped for more of such ar­rests in the Sin­ga­pore Strait, which would be an im­por­tant fac­tor in re­duc­ing the num­ber of in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>He also said ar­rests made by the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties in 2014 and 2015 had dras­ti­cally re­duced the num­ber of in­ci­dents in 2016.</p>
    <p>He noted that while the spike in in­ci­dents in Asia has co­in­cided with the Covid-19 pan­demic, it was dif­fi­cult to find any causal re­la­tion be­tween the two.</p>
    <p>He said: “We are not a re­search in­sti­tute. We are not do­ing any study, or have any data to as­sess the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Covid-19 and in­ci­dents in Asia.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of i nci­dents of piracy and armed rob­bery re­ported in Asian wa­ters reached its low­est in more than a decade in 2018, with 76 cases. This in­creased slightly to 82 last year.</p>
    <p>Re­ports of in­ci­dents are col­lated from des­ig­nated gov­ern­ment agen­cies of ReCAAP’s 20 mem­ber states, which in­clude Sin­ga­pore, In­dia, the Philip­pines, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and the United States.</p>
    <p>The Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity is Sin­ga­pore’s des­ig­nated agency.</p>
    <p>Re­cent ef­forts by Sin­ga­pore to tackle piracy in­clude the re­struc­tur­ing of the navy’s Mar­itime Se­cu­rity Task Force.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Navy also hosted a Malacca Strait Pa­trol Joint Co­or­di­nat­ing Com­mit­tee Meet­ing with rep­re­sen­ta­tives from In­done­sia, Malaysia and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>NIP­PING IT IN THE BUD</p>
    <p>Small crimes, if not ad­dressed, can em­bolden crim­i­nals to com­mit more se­ri­ous acts.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR MASAFUMI KUROKI, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Re­gional Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment on Com­bat­ing Piracy and Armed Rob­bery against Ships in Asia.</p>
