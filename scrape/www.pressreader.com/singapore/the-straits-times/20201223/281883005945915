    <p>In­dia’s Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi and his Viet­namese coun­ter­part Nguyen Xuan Phuc dis­cussed is­sues re­lated to the South China Sea as well as de­fence links between the two coun­tries dur­ing a vir­tual sum­mit this week.</p>
    <p>The two lead­ers un­der­scored the im­por­tance of “self-re­straint” and “non-mil­i­tari­sa­tion” of the South China Sea while draw­ing up a road map for closer de­fence ties.</p>
    <p>The South China Sea fea­tured promi­nently in Mon­day’s talks, which came at a time when both coun­tries have seen a down­turn in their re­spec­tive ties with China.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi stressed that the Code of Con­duct ne­go­ti­a­tions on the South China Sea should not prej­u­dice the in­ter­est of other coun­tries in the re­gion, said Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Sec­re­tary (East) Riva Gan­guly Das.</p>
    <p>Asean and China have been seek­ing to re­sume talks on a mar­itime code of con­duct.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the two coun­tries re­leased a doc­u­ment called In­dia-Viet­nam Joint Vi­sion for Peace, Pros­per­ity and Peo­ple, with two para­graphs ded­i­cated to the South China Sea is­sue.</p>
    <p>“Both lead­ers un­der­scored the im­por­tance of non-mil­i­tari­sa­tion and self-re­straint in the con­duct of all ac­tiv­i­ties by claimants and all other states, and avoid­ance of ac­tions that could fur­ther com­pli­cate the sit­u­a­tion or es­ca­late dis­putes af­fect­ing peace and sta­bil­ity,” said the doc­u­ment.</p>
    <p>In­dia is em­broiled in its worst bor­der trou­bles with China in over four decades. It has ac­cused China of chang­ing the sta­tus quo on the Ladakh re­gion bor­der, with ne­go­ti­a­tions so far fail­ing to re­solve all dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has com­pet­ing claims with China near the Para­cel Is­lands in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has ob­jected to Chi­nese mil­i­tary drills in the dis­puted area, ac­cused Bei­jing of in­tim­i­dat­ing its fish­er­men and of ad­vanc­ing ter­ri­to­rial claims dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts note that there are many ar­eas of con­ver­gence between In­dia and Viet­nam, which will also take their seats in the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil next month.</p>
    <p>“Among Asean mem­ber states, con­ver­gence with Viet­nam is great­est. Viet­nam has been much more open and ex­plicit in court­ing coun­tries like In­dia and try­ing to di­ver­sify the re­la­tion­ship bi­lat­er­ally,” said Pro­fes­sor Harsh Pant, di­rec­tor, stud­ies and head of the strate­gic stud­ies pro­gramme at the Ob­server Re­search Foun­da­tion in New Delhi.</p>
    <p>Though In­dia is not di­rectly in­volved in the ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute, China has ex­pressed ir­ri­ta­tion with its oil ex­plo­ration ac­tiv­i­ties in the area. One of the oil blocks in which In­dia is in­volved falls partly in ter­ri­tory that has been claimed by China.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness ties between In­dia and Viet­nam have grown over the years, with bi­lat­eral trade touch­ing US$12.34 bil­lion (S$16.46 bil­lion) in 2019-2020.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam is In­dia’s 18th largest trad­ing part­ner glob­ally and the fourth largest within Asean, af­ter Sin­ga­pore, Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Modi also in­vited Viet­namese com­pa­nies to in­vest in In­dia and high­lighted the ur­gent need for a long-over­due re­view of the Asean-In­dia Trade in Goods Agree­ment as a con­crete step to­wards re­vi­tal­is­ing eco­nomic en­gage­ment between In­dia and Viet­nam as well as the larger Asean re­gion.</p>
    <p>He also high­lighted the im­por­tance of ties in his open­ing re­marks at the sum­mit.</p>
    <p>“We see our re­la­tion­ship with Viet­nam from a long-term and strate­gic view... Our part­ner­ship can make a sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tion in main­tain­ing sta­bil­ity and peace in the re­gion,” said Mr Modi.</p>
    <p>De­fence, an­a­lysts have said, is emerg­ing as a key area of co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries also signed nine MOUs, in­clud­ing a frame­work for pro­mot­ing co­op­er­a­tion between the de­fence in­dus­tries of the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In­dia also handed over the first of 10 high-speed guard boats which are be­ing man­u­fac­tured un­der a US$100 mil­lion de­fence line of credit ex­tended in 2014 by In­dia to Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>“There is skill trans­fer and tech­nol­ogy trans­fer. Man­u­fac­tur­ing and ca­pac­ity trans­fer. I guess that’s the har­bin­ger for fu­ture projects,” said China ex­pert Pro­fes­sor Srikanth Kon­da­palli from the Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He noted that although ten­sions with China formed a com­mon ground, the two coun­tries also had his­tor­i­cal ties.</p>
