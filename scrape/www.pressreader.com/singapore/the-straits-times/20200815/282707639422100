    <p>• Former United States first lady Michelle Obama (left) is not afraid of get­ting per­sonal on her epony­mous Spo­tify pod­cast.</p>
    <p>The third and latest episode of The Michelle Obama Pod­cast – launched last month – was ti­tled What Your Mother Never Told You About Health With Dr Sharon Malone.</p>
    <p>In the episode, which was re­leased on Wed­nes­day, she spoke can­didly with Dr Malone, an ob­ste­tri­cian and gy­nae­col­o­gist, about women’s health, open­ing up about her ex­pe­ri­ences with menopause, ac­cord­ing to Harper’s Bazaar.</p>
    <p>“I have a very healthy base­line and also, well, I was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing hor­mone shifts be­cause of in­fer­til­ity, hav­ing to take shots and all that,” the 56-year-old said.</p>
    <p>She added: “I ex­pe­ri­enced the night sweats, even in my 30s, and when you t hink of t he other symp­toms that come along, just hot flashes, I mean, I had a few be­fore I started tak­ing hor­mones.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Obama also re­called a hot­flash episode while she was aboard Marine One.</p>
    <p>“I’m dressed. I need to get out, walk into an event and, lit­er­ally, it was like some­body put a fur­nace in my core and turned it on high and then ev­ery­thing started melt­ing. And I thought, ‘Well, this is crazy. I can’t. I can’t. I can’t do this’,” she said.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, her hus­band, former US pres­i­dent Barack Obama, was ac­cus­tomed to the bod­ily changes his wife was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing – many women in his Cab­i­net were older and go­ing through menopause.</p>
    <p>He re­sponded in his usual calm man­ner. “He didn’t fall apart... It was just sort of like, ‘Oh, well, turn the air-con­di­tioner on.’”</p>
    <p>Mrs Obama also talked about how men have lit­tle idea of how fe­male bod­ies work and that women, too, of­ten ap­proach their bod­ies with mys­ti­fi­ca­tion or shame.</p>
    <p>“When you think of all that a woman’s body has to do over the course of her life­time, go­ing from be­ing pre­pared to give birth to giv­ing birth, and then hav­ing that whole re­pro­duc­tive sys­tem shut down in menopause, right? The changes, the highs and lows and the hor­monal shifts, there is power in that,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But we were taught to be ashamed of it and to not even seek to un­der­stand it or ex­plore it for our own ed­i­fi­ca­tion, let alone to help the next gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
