    <p>• China’s pledge to be car­bon neu­tral by 2060 in­cludes all green­house gases, not just car­bon diox­ide, ac­cord­ing to one of the coun­try’s top cli­mate re­searchers.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor He Jiankun, who chairs the aca­demic com­mit­tee of Ts­inghua Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of Cli­mate Change and Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment, made the clar­i­fi­ca­tion yes­ter­day at a con­fer­ence out­lin­ing China’s road map to reach­ing its goal.</p>
    <p>When Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping told the United Na­tions about China’s new tar­get last month, he did not spec­ify if it would tar­get just car­bon diox­ide – the most preva­lent green­house gas – or oth­ers that also con­trib­ute to global warm­ing such as meth­ane and ozone.</p>
    <p>He also did not de­tail how China would achieve the goal, though the gov­ern­ment is ex­pected to lay out some mea­sures in its up­com­ing five-year plan un­til 2025.</p>
    <p>In line with the tar­get, China should an­nounce more am­bi­tious con­tri­bu­tions to the Paris cli­mate ac­cord, in­clud­ing re­duc­ing its car­bon in­ten­sity by over 65 per cent from 2005 lev­els and aim­ing for a higher share of non-fos­sil fuel en­ergy sources by 2030, Prof He said.</p>
    <p>But re­searchers at the con­fer­ence laid out sce­nar­ios that showed even that plan would not put China on the path to keep­ing global warm­ing within 2 deg C from pre-in­dus­trial lev­els, so it would have to scale up tar­gets even more af­ter 2030.</p>
    <p>Prof He said that to achieve the 2060 goal, China’s next five-year plan should in­clude cut­ting en­ergy con­sump­tion per capita of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct by at least 14 per cent, boost­ing the share of en­ergy that comes from non-fos­sil fu­els to about 20 per cent, and re­duc­ing car­bon diox­ide in­ten­sity by as much as 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Ts­inghua Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of En­ergy, En­vi­ron­ment and Econ­omy, re­leased its pro­posal for achiev­ing the 2060 tar­get, which en­tailed a more grad­ual tran­si­tion over the next decade and a half and a rapid ac­cel­er­a­tion af­ter 2035.</p>
