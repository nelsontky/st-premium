    <p>Ja­pan will halt its Go To Travel do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign na­tion­wide for two weeks, from Dec 28 to Jan 11, Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said yesterday.</p>
    <p>This marks a stun­ning U-turn as he caved to pub­lic and ex­pert criticism that his gov­ern­ment was be­ing fool­hardy in press­ing on with the scheme.</p>
    <p>The sus­pen­sion co­in­cides with what is typ­i­cally one of the busiest travel pe­ri­ods of the year, with mil­lions re­turn­ing to their home towns for fam­ily gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s bal­anc­ing act be­tween the econ­omy and pub­lic health risks has long tilted to­wards boost­ing con­sump­tion, but he has seen his Cab­i­net ap­proval ratings tum­ble over a per­ceived lack of lead­er­ship amid a surge in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Sup­port fell 14 per­cent­age points from last month to 42 per cent in a poll by pub­lic broad­caster NHK and by 17 per­cent­age points from last month to 40 per cent in a poll by the Mainichi daily news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga had polled above 60 per cent in both me­dia out­lets when he took of­fice in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>With the hon­ey­moon pe­riod clearly over and a gen­eral elec­tion due in 10 months, me­dia reports cited sources say­ing the fast-erod­ing sup­port had prompted Mr Suga to take far more de­ci­sive ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The sud­den an­nounce­ment of a na­tion­wide halt goes be­yond the rec­om­men­da­tions of the gov­ern­ment’s ex­pert panel, which had for weeks called for firmer ac­tion in only the worst-hit ar­eas, such as Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga had long said the Go To Travel sub­sidy scheme should not be a scape­goat for the surge in cases, ar­gu­ing that there was no sci­en­tific ev­i­dence con­nect­ing the scheme to the surge.</p>
    <p>But even some in his gov­ern­ment have ques­tioned the wis­dom of press­ing on, given the mixed mes­sag­ing to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial told the Mainichi: “It’s ridicu­lous to tell peo­ple to travel on the one hand, and at the same time tell them not to come into con­tact with other peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Mo­bile data showed foot traf­fic in­creas­ing over the week­end – the last week­end of what Mr Suga once de­scribed as a “crit­i­cal three-week bat­tle” against Covid-19 – in bustling hubs such as Shibuya and Ginza in Tokyo, Umeda in Osaka and Sakae in Nagoya.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est move, Osaka and Sap­poro, where the travel sub­sidy scheme has been halted since Nov 24, will have the sus­pen­sion ex­tended till Jan 11. Tokyo and Nagoya, which are fac­ing a bed crunch, will be ex­cluded from the scheme with im­me­di­ate ef­fect, un­til Jan 11.</p>
    <p>“The na­tion­wide num­ber of in­fec­tions con­tin­ues to be high, and we are see­ing more ar­eas with in­fec­tions spread­ing,” Mr Suga said yesterday. “We must take ut­most mea­sures to pro­tect lives, stem the spread of in­fec­tions and re­duce the bur­den on hos­pi­tals.”</p>
    <p>He promised to dou­ble re­lief pay­ments to doc­tors and nurses on the front line of the Covid-19 bat­tle­field, as well as to food and bev­er­age out­lets that ac­cede to re­quests to shorten busi­ness hours.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter also said he will con­sider the next steps for the cam­paign – which re­ceived ap­proval just last week to be ex­tended by six months to June – by re­view­ing the in­fec­tion sta­tus next month.</p>
    <p>The third wave of Covid-19 cases in Ja­pan is by far the worst it has seen. Last Satur­day, it recorded more than 3,000 new cases in a sin­gle day for the first time.</p>
    <p>There were at least 1,681 new cases yesterday, though ob­servers cau­tion against read­ing too much into Mon­day fig­ures as they tend to be lower, with fewer tests con­ducted over the week­end.</p>
    <p>More crit­i­cally, the num­ber of se­ri­ous pa­tients yesterday reached a new high of 588.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga pleaded to his peo­ple: “I ask ev­ery­one to take ba­sic pre­cau­tions... and to care­fully con­sider whether to travel to their home towns dur­ing the hol­i­days, so that we may have a peace­ful new year.”</p>
