    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s leader said she was hav­ing trou­ble us­ing her credit cards after the US im­posed sanc­tions tar­get­ing Hong Kong and main­land Chi­nese of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Still, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said yes­ter­day that she was not too both­ered about the US sanc­tions against her.</p>
    <p>But Hong Kong will com­plain to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) about a new US re­quire­ment on Hong Kong-made prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The United States this month im­posed sanc­tions on Mrs Lam and 10 other cur­rent and former Hong Kong and main­land of­fi­cials whom Wash­ing­ton ac­cuses of cur­tail­ing po­lit­i­cal free­dom in the fi­nan­cial hub.</p>
    <p>“De­spite some in­con­ve­nience in my per­sonal af­fairs, it is noth­ing I would take to heart,” Mrs Lam told a weekly news con­fer­ence. “We will con­tinue to do what is right for the coun­try and for Hong Kong.”</p>
    <p>The sanc­tions came in re­sponse to China’s im­po­si­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity law on the semi-au­tonomous city after of­ten vi­o­lent an­tiChina, pro-democ­racy protests last year.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing and Mrs Lam’s gov­ern­ment have de­fended the se­cu­rity law as nec­es­sary for Hong Kong’s sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tions freeze any US as­sets of the of­fi­cials tar­geted and bar Amer­i­cans from do­ing busi­ness with them.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said that while she her­self could not travel to the US, her gov­ern­ment would con­tinue to pro­mote Hong Kong to US busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment has also re­quired goods made in Hong Kong for export to the US to be la­belled as “Made in China” after Sept 25.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said Hong Kong and China were sep­a­rate WTO mem­bers, and Hong Kong would lodge a com­plaint against the US de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment has de­nounced the US sanc­tions as “shame­less and de­spi­ca­ble”, and “bla­tant and bar­baric” in­ter­fer­ence in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs.</p>
