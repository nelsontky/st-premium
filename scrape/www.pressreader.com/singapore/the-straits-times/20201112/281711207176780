    <p>Even as more peo­ple seem to be sur­ren­der­ing en­dow­ment and life plans bought from in­sur­ance com­pa­nies, there is a grow­ing trade in such poli­cies on the re­sale mar­ket.</p>
    <p>There are some 10 com­pa­nies of­fer­ing sell­ers 5 per cent to 20 per cent more than the sur­ren­der value that in­sur­ers would pay.</p>
    <p>Data from the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) shows pol­i­cy­hold­ers claimed al­most $2.2 bil­lion through the sur­ren­der of life prod­ucts last year, an in­crease of about 30 per cent from the nearly $1.7 bil­lion claimed in 2018.</p>
    <p>The spike in claims last year was al­most 150 per cent from the $893 mil­lion claimed in 2013, which was when the claims started to rise.</p>
    <p>MAS and the Life In­sur­ance As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore do not col­lect data on how many en­dow­ment poli­cies have been sur­ren­dered.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers told The Straits Times that they ex­pect more cash­strapped in­di­vid­u­als who are af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic to want to cash out.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier data, such as from the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2009 and the Sars out­break in 2003, shows there was a higher num­ber of poli­cies be­ing sur­ren­dered then, said Mr Micky Neo, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of REPs Hold­ings, a com­pany that buys such poli­cies.</p>
    <p>In 2003, there were claims worth $1 bil­lion through the sur­ren­der of life prod­ucts, up from $829 mil­lion in 2002. The global fi­nan­cial cri­sis saw claims surge 61 per cent from the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo, 42, said he ex­pects the trade to pick up once gov­ern­ment sup­port, which has been help­ing to cush­ion the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ta­pers off.</p>
    <p>Those who wish to sell their poli­cies will have to as­sign the pol­icy to a buyer who will con­tinue to pay the pre­mi­ums and even­tu­ally re­ceive the ma­tu­rity value.</p>
    <p>In the case of a life pol­icy, it will be the life of the orig­i­nal in­sured per­son that will con­tinue to be cov­ered, but any pay­out will go to who­ever the pol­icy is as­signed to.</p>
    <p>The buyer po­ten­tially gets higher re­turns from the shorter time to the ma­tu­rity of the pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Ms Cather­ine Ho de­cided to give up her an­nu­ity pol­icy last month be­cause she felt it was re­dun­dant.</p>
    <p>The 42-year-old ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant had been pay­ing $250 a month for six years.</p>
    <p>“I need to pay for 10 years be­fore I can get a pay­out of just over $1,000 a year,” said Ms Ho.</p>
    <p>We are still rel­a­tively young and we wanted to start a fam­ily in maybe 2022. So Deb­o­rah ten­dered (her res­ig­na­tion) in Septem­ber last year. I ten­dered (mine) in March this year.</p>
    <p>Now is the best time... for us, and also for the mar­ket en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“I looked at all the other in­sur­ance poli­cies I have and felt that this one doesn’t give me much re­turns and I de­cided to give it up.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ho said she sold her pol­icy to REPs Hold­ings for a higher amount than what she would have re­ceived from the in­surer at that point, though it was still lower than the to­tal amount she had paid un­til then.</p>
    <p>Be­tween March and last month,</p>
    <p>Mr Neo’s firm spent $8.5 mil­lion buy­ing 650 en­dow­ment poli­cies. He said he looks for in­vest­ment re­turns of be­tween 5 per cent and 8 per cent a year when buy­ing poli­cies, which he then sells at be­tween 4 per cent and 5 per cent re­turns. The dif­fer­ence would be his profit.</p>
    <p>For a life pol­icy, the buyer can also sur­ren­der it when the value is higher.</p>
    <p>Buy­ers gen­er­ally pre­fer poli­cies with less than 10 years to ma­tu­rity.</p>
    <p>There is no limit to the num­ber of times an en­dow­ment or life pol­icy can change own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>An on­line search showed at least 10 com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Purvis Cap­i­tal, Con­ser­va­tion Cap­i­tal and Pol­i­cyWoke, of­fer­ing to buy en­dow­ment and life poli­cies and promis­ing higher rates than in­sur</p>
    <p>ers would pay if pol­i­cy­hold­ers were to sur­ren­der their poli­cies.</p>
    <p>New play­ers i nclude En­dow­ment Ex­change run by Mr Peter Oh and his wife Deb­o­rah Ong.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple are look­ing to build up an in­ven­tory of 100 poli­cies of be­tween $3 mil­lion and $5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Us­ing their sav­ings and fam­ily funds to make pur­chases, they are tar­get­ing a re­turn of 6 per cent and above per an­num and plan to hold on to the poli­cies un­til they have hit their tar­get, Mr Oh said.</p>
    <p>“When we hit our tar­get, we would then look at how to re­cy­cle the cap­i­tal and also op­er­ate as a re­sale bro­ker­age,” said Mr Oh, 31, who left his job as an in­vest­ment coun­sel­lor with HSBC Pri­vate Bank to start En­dow­ment Ex­change.</p>
    <p>Ms Ong, 28, who was formerly an equity re­search an­a­lyst with Bank of Sin­ga­pore, said they found out about the re­sale of en­dow­ment poli­cies when they at­tended a talk by one of the com­pa­nies in the trade two years ago.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Oh: “We are still rel­a­tively young and we wanted to start a fam­ily in maybe 2022. So Deb­o­rah ten­dered (her res­ig­na­tion) in Septem­ber last year. I ten­dered (mine) in March this year.</p>
    <p>“Now is the best time... for us, and also for the mar­ket en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
