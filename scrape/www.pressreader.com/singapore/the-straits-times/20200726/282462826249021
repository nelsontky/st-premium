    <p>Buf­fets – where din­ers help them­selves to an ar­ray of dishes laid out as a spread – are no more, a ca­su­alty of the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter dine-in was al­lowed again in phase two of the econ­omy’s re­open­ing on June 19, they are still off the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>The con­cept had been very pop­u­lar with din­ers who packed such eater­ies, es­pe­cially on week­ends.</p>
    <p>It also en­sured a steady in­come stream for the es­tab­lish­ments, with fixed prices guar­an­tee­ing a sub­stan­tial min­i­mum spend­ing a per­son.</p>
    <p>So while some buf­fet eater­ies such as Melt at The Man­darin Ori­en­tal Sin­ga­pore, Edge at Pan Pa­cific Sin­ga­pore, Carousel at Royal Plaza on Scotts and the mass-mar­ket Sakura Ja­panese buf­fet chain re­main closed, oth­ers have re­opened – but with their con­cepts tweaked to meet safety re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Most adopt a model bet­ter known as a la carte buf­fet, where din­ers can or­der as much as they want from a menu for one price and the food is served to the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Seoul Gar­den, a chain of ha­lal Korean bar­be­cue restau­rants with seven out­lets here, used to of­fer only buf­fets. It now of­fers a la carte buf­fets for week­end lunch and daily din­ner. For week­day lunch, only set meals are avail­able.</p>
    <p>Din­ers tick their choices on a chit and the raw in­gre­di­ents are brought to the ta­ble. Pre­vi­ously, it was self-ser­vice from an ar­ray of food laid out in chillers.</p>
    <p>At ho­tels such as Man­darin Or­chard, Grand Hy­att, The RitzCarl­ton, Mil­lenia Sin­ga­pore and JW Mar­riott, the menu is em­bed­ded in QR codes to min­imise con­tact.</p>
    <p>Din­ers read the se­lec­tion on their smart­phones be­fore plac­ing their or­ders ver­bally with servers.</p>
    <p>JW Mar­riott’s Beach Road Kitchen also fea­tures rov­ing “chef­son-show” who go around with trol­leys laden with cheeses, desserts or hot dishes like a salt­baked bar­ra­mundi.</p>
    <p>Din­ers point out what they want and the chefs plate it for them.</p>
    <p>At The Line at Shangri-La Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore, the chefs whip up dishes at the open food sta­tions like be­fore. But din­ers re­main seated and make their or­ders via a dig­i­tal menu.</p>
    <p>One-Ninety Restau­rant at Four Sea­sons Sin­ga­pore, how­ever, is stick­ing with its semi-buf­fet for­mat, where ap­pe­tis­ers and desserts are laid out while main cour­ses are or­dered from a menu.</p>
    <p>What has changed, how­ever, is that the spread is dis­played be­hind trans­par­ent par­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Guests are ac­com­pa­nied one at a time by ser­vice staff to view and make their choices be­fore re­turn­ing to the ta­ble to wait for them to be served.</p>
    <p>Even hot­pot eater­ies that used to let cus­tomers mix their own dip­ping sauces from a condi­ment spread have stopped the prac­tice.</p>
    <p>The Beauty In The Pot chain, for ex­am­ple, of­fers a few sauce mixes, but din­ers can cus­tomise their own by telling the servers how they want them.</p>
    <p>Hai Di Lao, a suc­cess­ful chain from China, does the same.</p>
    <p>While it would seem that more ser­vice staff are re­quired for this, it does not nec­es­sar­ily trans­late to ex­tra costs for the restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Says a spokesman for JW Mar­riott: “Labour cost stays the same be­cause of two fac­tors – reshuf­fling of jobs and re­duced dine-in ca­pac­ity.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the Four Sea­sons ho­tel says it did not have to in­crease man­power, but just had to do some re­or­gan­i­sa­tion of its ser­vice team.</p>
    <p>Seoul Gar­den, how­ever, says labour cost has gone up by 20 per cent be­cause of the ex­tra hands needed to take or­ders and serve.</p>
    <p>But any uptick in cost is also bal­anced out by sav­ings from less food wastage be­cause most of the hot food is cooked a la minute.</p>
    <p>In view of this, some restau­rants have re­duced their prices slightly, partly to drum up in­ter­est as well.</p>
    <p>Beach Road Kitchen, for ex­am­ple, now charges $88 for din­ner in­stead of $90 and $108 for brunch, down from $118.</p>
    <p>Or­chard Cafe at Or­chard Ho­tel, too, has cut prices by $20 for week­end l unch to $48, and $10 for din­ner on Fri­days and Satur­days to $78.</p>
    <p>Din­ers are bit­ing. Many of the ho­tels and restau­rants The Sun­day Times spoke to re­port brisk busi­ness, although rev­enues are down com­pared with pre-Covid-19 days be­cause of re­duced seat­ing to meet so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules of hav­ing ta­bles at least 1m apart.</p>
    <p>Beach Road Kitchen, for ex­am­ple, has halved its 200-per­son seat­ing ca­pac­ity and is about 80 per cent full on most days.</p>
    <p>Or­chard Cafe re­ported a full house over the last week­end, but its ca­pac­ity has gone down from 207 to 100.</p>
    <p>And Triple Three at the Man­darin Or­chard has re­duced its seats even more dras­ti­cally, from 150 to 60. It is close to full ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>The a la carte buf­fet model also ap­peals to din­ers in that the food looks bet­ter when plated by chefs and, be­ing freshly cooked, of­ten tastes bet­ter than what was pre­vi­ously left to sit in chaf­ing dishes.</p>
    <p>Mr Do­minic Chu, who was at Beach Road Kitchen for din­ner last week, was im­pressed by the new con­cept.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old bank ad­min­is­tra­tor says: “Even though there seemed to be fewer dishes than be­fore, there was still more than I could eat. And every­thing was plated very nicely.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, the f ood tasted even bet­ter, es­pe­cially the roasted rib­eye that was so juicy.”</p>
