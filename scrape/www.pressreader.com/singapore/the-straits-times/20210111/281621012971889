    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has restarted fer­ry­ing some pas­sen­gers from the United King­dom through Chang iA ir port in a tweaked for­mat, after it re­ceived a lim­ited ex­emp­tion for a ban on short-term UK trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Un­like the usual ar­range­ment where tran­sit pas­sen­gers would alight at Changi be­fore board­ing an­other plane for flights to the two ex­empted des­ti­na­tion coun­tries – Aus­tralia and New Zealand – SIA has ad­justed its of­fer­ing to have a “same-plane through ser­vice”.</p>
    <p>This means that its planes from the UK’s Heathrow Air­port would stop for about 90 min­utes in Sin­ga­pore, where re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents would dis­em­bark, be­fore fly­ing on to Syd­ney in Aus­tralia or Auck­land in New Zealand, SIA told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>All long-term pass hold­ers and short-term vis­i­tors with travel his­tory to the UK within the last 14 days have been banned from en­ter­ing or tran­sit­ing through Sin­ga­pore from 11.59pm on Dec 23, fol­low­ing the emer­gence of a new coro­n­avirus strain there.</p>
    <p>But SIA said late last week that it has re­ceived ap­proval to fly pas­sen­gers from the UK to Syd­ney or Auck­land via Sin­ga­pore, with sev­eral pre­cau­tions in place.</p>
    <p>These in­clude tak­ing a poly­merase chain reaction test within 72 hours prior to their flight to prove they are not in­fected, and un­der­go­ing a pre-de­par­ture health as­sess­ment to en­sure they do not have a fever and are fit to fly.</p>
    <p>SIA added: “Tran­sit pas­sen­gers from the United King­dom... will be seg­re­gated from other pas­sen­gers while in the air­craft cabin from the start of their jour­ney in the United King­dom. Seat changes are not al­lowed at any point of the jour­ney.”</p>
    <p>Syd­ney- or Auck­land-bound pas­sen­gers will re­main in the air­craft while it is in tran­sit in Sin­ga­pore, dur­ing which clean­ers in full per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment will clean the toi­lets and other parts of the air­craft cabin. They will avoid the sec­tion where tran­sit­ing pas­sen­gers are seated.</p>
    <p>Other pre­cau­tions that were ear­lier an­nounced, such as a mod­i­fied meal ser­vice, manda­tory wear­ing of masks and crew wear­ing per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, re­main in place.</p>
    <p>In the case of a pas­sen­ger or a crew mem­ber feel­ing un­well, the per­son would be moved to a ded­i­cated quar­an­tine area within the plane. A cabin crew mem­ber in full per­sonal pro­tec­tive gear will tend to the per­son, and the med­i­cal au­thor­i­ties will fol­low up im­me­di­ately after the plane lands.</p>
    <p>SIA also re­it­er­ated that its planes are equipped with high-ef­fi­ciency par­tic­u­late air fil­ters. These fil­ters re­move 99.9 per cent of known viruses and re­fresh cabin air ev­ery two to three min­utes.</p>
    <p>When asked about the num­ber of pas­sen­gers who have flown on the same-plane through ser­vice so far, SIA said it does not com­ment on com­mer­cially sen­si­tive mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ini­tial ban on tran­sit pas­sen­gers from the UK had sparked con­cerns that it would leave Aus­tralians who were look­ing to re­turn home from Europe stranded. Hong Kong, an­other ma­jor tran­sit hub for the UK-Aus­tralia route, had banned flights from the UK.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie from So­bie Avi­a­tion said the same-plane through ser­vice is not un­usual. “This is a way around to main­tain some tran­sit busi­ness with­out tech­ni­cally be­ing con­sid­ered tran­sit,” he said.</p>
    <p>“A lot of SIA’s pas­sen­gers that orig­i­nate in Lon­don are head­ing to Syd­ney and Auck­land, so if you re­move them, the traf­fic on flights from Lon­don to Sin­ga­pore and from Sin­ga­pore to Syd­ney and Auck­land could drop sig­nif­i­cantly from what has al­ready been a very low fig­ure dur­ing the pan­demic.”</p>
