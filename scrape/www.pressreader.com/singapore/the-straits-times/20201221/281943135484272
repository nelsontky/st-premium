    <p>On an of­fi­cial visit to Aus­tralia in 2016, then Vice-Pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den gave a ring­ing en­dorse­ment of the al­liance be­tween the United States and Aus­tralia, forged in blood in World War II.</p>
    <p>“It’s over­whelm­ingly in our in­ter­est that Aus­tralia con­tinue to grow, suc­ceed and pros­per,” he said in a ma­jor speech that re­it­er­ated Amer­ica’s stay­ing power in the Asia-Pa­cific. “The part­ner­ship be­tween Aus­tralia and Amer­ica is at the core of our vi­sion for the re­gion’s fu­ture. It’s not what we can do for Aus­tralia. It’s what we can do with Aus­tralia.”</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward four years and Mr Bi­den is Amer­ica’s Pres­i­dent-elect, gear­ing up to take of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>And Aus­tralia has found it­self in a wors­en­ing trade spat with China that may present the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion with one of its first for­eign pol­icy chal­lenges, and whose re­sponse will be closely watched by other na­tions nav­i­gat­ing the ri­valry be­tween the United States and China.</p>
    <p>For­eign pol­icy watch­ers in Wash­ing­ton have called on Mr Bi­den to take ac­tion to back an ally. In­com­ing na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Jake Sul­li­van, who has made pub­lic state­ments spar­ingly since his nom­i­na­tion was an­nounced, has sig­nalled that he is of that mind.</p>
    <p>He wrote on Twit­ter early this month: “As we have for a cen­tury, Amer­ica will stand shoul­der to shoul­der with our ally Aus­tralia and rally fel­low democ­ra­cies to ad­vance our shared se­cu­rity, pros­per­ity and val­ues.”</p>
    <p>Why Aus­tralia is be­ing tar­geted</p>
    <p>Trade re­la­tions be­tween China and Aus­tralia have spi­ralled down­wards this year, with China im­pos­ing tar­iffs and re­stric­tions on Aus­tralian wine, bar­ley, beef, rock lob­ster, tim­ber and coal, as well as other goods in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>While some ac­tions are of­fi­cially anti-dump­ing and anti-sub­sidy counter-mea­sures, oth­ers have not even been ac­knowl­edged by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The diplo­matic row was first sparked in Au­gust 2018 when Aus­tralia black­listed Huawei equip­ment from its 5G net­work over na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns, and kicked into high gear in April this year af­ter Can­berra called for an in­ter­na­tional in­quiry into Bei­jing’s early re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic – ac­tions that led Bei­jing to call the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment a stooge of Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>China blames Aus­tralia’s ac­tions for the fraught ties, and cited these episodes and oth­ers in a list of 14 dis­putes re­port­edly is­sued by the Chi­nese Em­bassy in Can­berra. The Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment has called the com­plaints un­rea­son­able and says it stands by its prin­ci­ples and sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s ac­tions are meant to de­ter oth­ers, in­clud­ing Canada and Euro­pean coun­tries, from sid­ing with Wash­ing­ton in a coali­tion against China, said an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>“Bei­jing is try­ing to make an ex­am­ple out of Aus­tralia and to make Aus­tralia pay a price for dis­agree­ing pub­licly with the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment over a va­ri­ety of is­sues,” Amer­i­can En­ter­prise In­sti­tute re­search fel­low Zack Cooper told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“This is kind of sanc­tion­ing the chicken to scare the mon­keys,” he added in a twist on a Chi­nese id­iom of us­ing heavy-handed tac­tics on one tar­get to de­ter oth­ers from the same be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s ac­tions are part of an ac­cel­er­at­ing trend out­lined by Dr John Lee and Dr Charles Edel, non-res­i­dent se­nior fel­lows at the Syd­ney-based United States Stud­ies Cen­tre, in their 2019 re­port on the fu­ture of the US-Aus­tralia al­liance in an era of great power com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>They ar­gue that China’s goal is to es­tab­lish a Sino-cen­tric Indo-Pa­cific re­gion. To this end, it has sought to un­der­mine US al­liances in Asia and con­vince states in the Indo-Pa­cific “that the cost of be­ing dragged into a dis­pute be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton is too high”.</p>
    <p>“As China’s mes­sag­ing seems to posit, it is bet­ter for smaller states to re­main on the side­lines and ad­just to the in­evitabil­ity of Chi­nese pre-em­i­nence. If coun­tries nev­er­the­less crit­i­cise or op­pose these and other Chi­nese ac­tions, they fre­quently suf­fer diplo­matic freezes, com­mer­cial threats or real eco­nomic pun­ish­ment,” wrote</p>
    <p>Dr Lee and Dr Edel.</p>
    <p>In this in­stance, Aus­tralia is an easy tar­get as China is its largest trad­ing part­ner and the des­ti­na­tion of nearly 40 per cent of its ex­ports.</p>
    <p>Bi­den’s op­tions</p>
    <p>To dis­suade Bei­jing from us­ing trade ag­gres­sion to sig­nal its dis­plea­sure at other coun­tries’ poli­cies, the US and other coun­tries have to change Bei­jing’s cost-ben­e­fit anal­y­sis by in­creas­ing the cost of eco­nomic co­er­cion and de­creas­ing the bur­den on tar­get coun­tries, ex­perts ar­gue.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee told The Straits Times: “Like many al­lies, Aus­tralia would like to see closer co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the US, Asian al­lies and Euro­pean al­lies when it comes to im­pos­ing de­ter­rents and even costs on aber­rant Chi­nese be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“It is about in­di­vid­u­ally and col­lec­tively set­ting ac­cept­able an­chor points with China when it comes to the lat­ter’s be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>One op­tion could be for the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to sup­port Aus­tralia’s for­mal ap­peal, an­nounced last week, to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) to re­view China’s tar­iffs on bar­ley im­ported from Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>For­mer act­ing deputy US trade rep­re­sen­ta­tive Wendy Cut­ler and Mr James Green, a for­mer min­is­ter coun­sel­lor for trade af­fairs at the US Em­bassy in Bei­jing, both urged the US, Aus­tralia and other trad­ing part­ners to join forces at the WTO and call out Bei­jing’s in­frac­tions, in a com­men­tary pub­lished in The Straits Times last month.</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tively high­light­ing and draw­ing at­ten­tion to Bei­jing’s be­hav­iour might make Chi­nese lead­ers think twice be­fore us­ing the same kind of tac­tics else­where, even if it did not stop bad be­hav­iour out­right, said</p>
    <p>Dr Cooper.</p>
    <p>He ar­gued that the Chi­nese in the past have tra­di­tion­ally been wor­ried about how they are seen ex­ter­nally, and that co­er­cive eco­nomic prac­tices have been very un­pop­u­lar in tar­get coun­tries.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, China’s ban on rare earth ex­ports to Ja­pan and eco­nomic re­tal­i­a­tion against South Korea over its anti-mis­sile sys­tem were fol­lowed by an im­me­di­ate, rapid drop in the pop­u­lar­ity of the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment in pub­lic polls there.</p>
    <p>“China has been will­ing to bear that wors­en­ing in polling data in part be­cause it’s usu­ally largely just in af­fected coun­tries. So if there was more at­ten­tion paid to these co­er­cive prac­tices, China would see its pop­u­lar­ity de­crease not just in the coun­tries it’s tar­get­ing, but in other coun­tries as well,” said Dr Cooper.</p>
    <p>“Over the long term, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party has been pretty care­ful to try and avoid those kinds of long-term dam­ag­ing ac­tiv­i­ties. So I do think that it would help.”</p>
    <p>Com­ing at it from an­other an­gle, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion can also work to blunt the pain of China’s eco­nomic pres­sures.</p>
    <p>One way is to pull to­gether an in­for­mal eco­nomic al­liance of like-minded coun­tries, a pro­posal that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is con­sid­er­ing, ac­cord­ing to a Wall Street Jour­nal re­port last month.</p>
    <p>Un­der this plan, China’s ban on im­ports from tar­get coun­tries could be off­set if other coun­tries agree to buy the sur­plus goods in­stead.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers around the world are cam­paign­ing for a loose ver­sion of this idea. The In­ter-Par­lia­men­tary Al­liance on China, a group of more than 200 law­mak­ers from 19 dif­fer­ent coun­tries in­clud­ing US Con­gress­man Ted Yoho of Florida, has started a cam­paign urg­ing peo­ple to stand up for democ­racy and buy Aus­tralian wine.</p>
    <p>While such an ar­range­ment will not be able to make up for all the losses, it could soften the blow and de­ter fu­ture in­stances of eco­nomic co­er­cion.</p>
    <p>“If China puts pres­sure on one coun­try, other friends, like-minded coun­tries, can help sup­port that coun­try a bit,” said Dr Cooper. “This is the idea that you either hang to­gether or hang sep­a­rately.”</p>
    <p>At the same time, coun­tries should also try to de­crease their vul­ner­a­bil­ity to eco­nomic co­er­cion in the first place by as­sess­ing their sup­ply chains and min­imis­ing their re­liance on po­ten­tially hos­tile coun­tries, he added.</p>
    <p>Wider im­pli­ca­tions</p>
    <p>In some ways, the on­go­ing trade row has been en­abled by past US ad­min­is­tra­tions not do­ing enough pre­vi­ously to dis­cour­age China from en­gag­ing in eco­nomic co­er­cion.</p>
    <p>Pro­po­nents of con­fronting China point to the many times it has hap­pened be­fore over var­i­ous griev­ances, although Bei­jing has usu­ally blamed the trade slow­downs on other rea­sons such as health and fire code vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing banned rare earth ex­ports to Ja­pan in 2010 over a ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute, throt­tled im­ports of Nor­we­gian fish in 2010 af­ter a Chi­nese dis­si­dent was awarded the No­bel Peace Prize, re­stricted Philip­pine banana im­ports in 2012 over a South China Sea dis­pute, blocked Mon­go­lian com­modi­ties af­ter the Dalai Lama vis­ited the coun­try in 2016, and boy­cotted South Korean busi­nesses in 2017 over its anti-mis­sile sys­tem de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>“In gen­eral, there aren’t many penal­ties for these kinds of ac­tions,” said Dr Cooper. “The rea­son the Chi­nese are will­ing to do that is be­cause they feel like they just haven’t paid much of the cost in the past.”</p>
    <p>For Aus­tralia, it is hop­ing that the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will con­tinue the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s tougher ap­proach to China, al­beit with more strat­egy, and fears a dis­en­gaged style rem­i­nis­cent of the sec­ond-term Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Lee: “Aus­tralia will be hop­ing that Bi­den demon­strates the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s com­pet­i­tive in­stincts and tem­per­a­ment with a bet­ter strate­gic mind­set and set of in­sti­tu­tional ob­jec­tives and out­comes.</p>
    <p>“Can­berra would not want a re­turn to a sec­ond-term Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­proach, which left al­lies such as Aus­tralia feel­ing more vul­ner­a­ble and China in a more as­cen­dant po­si­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>While dis­en­gage­ment un­der Mr Bi­den re­mains a risk, the early signs against it are en­cour­ag­ing, said an­a­lysts. They point to Mr Sul­li­van’s early state­ment on the Aus­tralia episode, a rare tweet af­ter his nom­i­na­tion, as a sig­nal of how im­por­tant he re­gards the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully they’re search­ing through op­tions now for what they can do when they come in,” said Dr Cooper. “But just hav­ing made clear that this is not some­thing that they are plan­ning to ig­nore when they come in is an im­por­tant sign, both to the Aus­tralians and to the Chi­nese, but also to oth­ers around the world who po­ten­tially could face this kind of pres­sure.”</p>
    <p>If China puts pres­sure on one coun­try, other friends, like-minded coun­tries, can help sup­port that coun­try a bit. This is the idea that you either hang to­gether or hang sep­a­rately.</p>
