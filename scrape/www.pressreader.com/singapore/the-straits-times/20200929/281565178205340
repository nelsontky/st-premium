    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) yes­ter­day bought 40 new trains for the North-South and East-West MRT lines, as re­newal works for its two old­est train lines con­tinue apace. The trains, cost­ing about $337.8 mil­lion, will re­place the sec­ond- and third-gen­er­a­tion trains that have been run­ning for at least two decades.</p>
    <p>The ob­jec­tives of this re­newal are to re­place ma­jor parts of the sys­tem that have been sub­jected to wear and tear, and also to im­prove the ca­pa­bil­ity and per­for­mance of the sys­tem. The Gov­ern­ment and rail op­er­a­tors have in­vested bil­lions of dol­lars and count­less hours into this.</p>
    <p>TRANS­PORT MIN­IS­TER ONG YE KUNG</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) yes­ter­day bought 40 new trains for the North-South and East-West MRT lines (NSEWL), as re­newal works for its two old­est train lines con­tinue apace.</p>
    <p>The trains, cost­ing about $337.8 mil­lion, will re­place the sec­on­dand third-gen­er­a­tion trains supplied by Siemens and Kawasak­iNip­pon Sharyo that have been run­ning for at least two decades.</p>
    <p>The first of these new trains will be­gin rolling on the tracks in 2024, and will have up­graded fea­tures such as more open spa­ces for strollers and wheel­chair users, as well as new LCD screens dis­play­ing travel in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>This con­tract is the sec­ond such awarded to rail com­pany Bom­bardier Trans­porta­tion, which in 2018 was tasked to re­place 66 trains on the NSEWL. This means that 106 of the 198 trains on these two lines, which have been in op­er­a­tion since 1987, will even­tu­ally be supplied by Bom­bardier Trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>With the lat­est move, the re­newal project for Sin­ga­pore’s two old­est lines that be­gan in 2012 has passed the half­way mark and the most dif­fi­cult re­place­ment pro­cesses have been com­pleted, said Min­is­ter for</p>
    <p>Trans­port Ong Ye Kung at the con­tract-sign­ing event yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The ob­jec­tives of this re­newal are to re­place ma­jor parts of the sys­tem that have been sub­jected to wear and tear, and also to im­prove the ca­pa­bil­ity and per­for­mance of the sys­tem. The Gov­ern­ment and rail op­er­a­tors have in­vested bil­lions of dol­lars and count­less hours into this,” Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>In the past decade, the sig­nalling sys­tem, or the en­tire soft­ware of the MRT sys­tem, has been changed, al­low­ing it to run trains at 100-sec­ond in­stead of 120-sec­ond in­ter­vals.</p>
    <p>More than 100,000 track sleep­ers, or the parts on which the train</p>
    <p>wheels sit, have also been me­chan­i­cally taken out and re­in­stalled dur­ing pe­ri­ods when the trains are not run­ning. This en­abled train ser­vices to be main­tained de­spite some pe­ri­ods of higher fre­quen­cies of dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion to work more closely with Bom­bardier Trans­porta­tion is partly mo­ti­vated by cost con­cerns, the LTA said yes­ter­day. This way, trains can be bought at a cheaper price and the types of trains re­duced, al­low­ing en­gi­neers to know them more thor­oughly and re­act bet­ter to faults.</p>
    <p>SMRT also signed a 10-year con­tract with Bom­bardier Trans­porta</p>
    <p>tion for the com­pany to pro­vide tech­ni­cal sup­port and spare parts for train re­pairs and sys­tem up­grades or re­place­ments for the first 10 years.</p>
    <p>This can be ex­tended for an­other 20 years later.</p>
    <p>The LTA, in not­ing the “sig­nif­i­cant economies of scale” of such a move, said: “Ini­tia­tives such as these are cen­tral to ef­forts by LTA and the rail op­er­a­tors to con­tinue de­liv­er­ing re­li­able train ser­vices, while man­ag­ing costs.”</p>
    <p>The Bom­bardier trains, all 106 of which are of the same de­sign, will be as­sem­bled in China, with parts sourced from other coun­tries in­clud­ing Swe­den, France and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong also noted the his­tor­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance of the train re­place­ment, with the lat­est move ef­fec­tively phas­ing out the first three gen­er­a­tions of trains by 2026.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the LTA is ex­plor­ing ways to keep some of the car­riages of these old trains in in­sti­tu­tions such as schools and gov­ern­ment agen­cies to pre­serve the coun­try’s trans­port her­itage.</p>
    <p>It is also open to the car­riages be­ing con­verted for other uses, such as for decor at MRT-themed ho­tels or cafes, and in­ter­ested par­ties can con­tact the LTA for more de­tails.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said of the old trains: “These three gen­er­a­tions of work­horses are im­por­tant mark­ers of the Sin­ga­pore story, and we should find ways to com­mem­o­rate their con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>“Many Sin­ga­pore­ans feel strongly about this, writ­ing to me fre­quently ask­ing me what will hap­pen to our pi­o­neer­ing trains, hop­ing that they would be given al­ter­nate new leases of life.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has six MRT lines, with more lines, in­clud­ing the Jurong Re­gion and Cross Is­land lines, set to open.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the Gov­ern­ment ac­cepted the Public Trans­port Coun­cil’s rec­om­men­da­tion that fares not go up in the com­ing year be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, with the coun­cil cit­ing the af­ford­abil­ity of train and bus rides as one of its key con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
