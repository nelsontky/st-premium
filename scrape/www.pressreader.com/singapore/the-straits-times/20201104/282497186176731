    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Twi­light Pay­ment led from start to fin­ish to claim the A$8 mil­lion (S$7.75 mil­lion) Mel­bourne Cup in a stun­ning run yes­ter­day, but the vic­tory was soured by the death of last year’s Ep­som Derby win­ner An­thony Van Dyck.</p>
    <p>Eight-year-old geld­ing Twi­light Pay­ment held off run­ner-up Tiger Moth and a late charge from Prince of Ar­ran to de­liver jockey Jye McNeil a dream de­but, in “the race that stops the na­tion” at Flem­ing­ton Race­course that was closed off to the public be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Joseph O’Brien, son of famed Ir­ish trainer Ai­dan, claimed his sec­ond Mel­bourne Cup win, hav­ing pre­pared Twi­light Pay­ment, a 22-1 chance, three years after Rekin­dling won the 2017 race by edg­ing out his fa­ther’s Jo­hannes Ver­meer.</p>
    <p>Twi­light Pay­ment’s win also se­cured lo­cal owner Lloyd Wil­liams a sev­enth Mel­bourne Cup tri­umph.</p>
    <p>“Too many emo­tions. It’s a very big mo­ment,” said McNeil.</p>
    <p>“(My wife) Jess and the boy will hope­fully be watch­ing from home. They couldn’t be here to­day but I’m sure they will be very proud.”</p>
    <p>Few horses go the dis­tance in the race when jump­ing out early but McNeil said it was al­ways the plan.</p>
    <p>“I was con­fi­dent. I was try­ing not to use the whip too many times,” he said. “I was try­ing to use my voice to en­cour­age him as much as pos­si­ble and it was a mat­ter of hang­ing on, and he was very tough.”</p>
    <p>Five years after Michelle Payne be­came the first woman to ride a Mel­bourne Cup win­ner on rank outsider Prince of Pen­zance, Jamie Kah, the only fe­male jockey in the race, rode to third place on Prince of Ar­ran.</p>
    <p>Sur­prise Baby, trained by Paul Preusker, was an 11-2 pre-race favourite but fin­ished 13th, while King of Leogrance was scratched in the morn­ing after be­ing found lame by stew­ards, leaving a field of 23.</p>
    <p>It was, how­ever, a som­bre day for race or­gan­is­ers and the con­nec­tions of An­thony Van Dyck, with the Ai­dan O’Brien-trained horse put down after break­ing down late in the race.</p>
    <p>The five-year-old stal­lion, run­ner-up at last month’s A$5 mil­lion Caulfield Cup, car­ried the top weight of 58.5kg on a hot af­ter­noon at Flem­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“It is with sad­ness that we con­firm that An­thony Van Dyck had to be hu­manely eu­thanised after sus­tain­ing a frac­tured fet­lock dur­ing the run­ning of the Mel­bourne Cup at Flem­ing­ton,” Rac­ing Vic­to­ria’s in­tegrity chief Jamie Stier said.</p>
    <p>“The horse re­ceived im­me­di­ate vet­eri­nary care, how­ever, he was un­able to be saved due to the na­ture of the in­jury sus­tained.”</p>
    <p>Van Dyck’s death came two years after Ai­dan O’Brien’s The Cliffs of Mo­her pulled up lame in the 2018 race and was put down on the track after vets found the horse had bro­ken a shoul­der.</p>
    <p>It is likely to heap fur­ther pres­sure on an in­dus­try rocked by a slew of horse deaths dur­ing re­cent Mel­bourne Cup car­ni­vals, with an­i­mal ac­tivists lash­ing out on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“His fi­nal mo­ments would have been so painful and ter­ri­fy­ing,” An­i­mals Aus­tralia said.</p>
    <p>“No an­i­mal de­serves to suf­fer like this for gam­bling money ... RIP An­thony Van Dyck.”</p>
    <p>TRACK RECORD</p>
    <p>A race­horse dies ev­ery three days on Aus­tralian race­tracks. The only dif­fer­ence is on Mel­bourne Cup day, the whole coun­try is watch­ing.</p>
    <p>ANDY MED­DICK, An­i­mal Jus­tice Party MP, who rep­re­sents the elec­torate of Western Vic­to­ria.</p>
