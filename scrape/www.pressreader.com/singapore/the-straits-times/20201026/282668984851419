    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Di­vert some of your great en­ergy to­wards other peo­ple, or things may get pretty crazy when their needs start to out­weigh yours.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Deal with an is­sue that makes you feel like a time trav­eller from long ago. It may be a new gad­get that baf­fles you.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your cre­ative side is much more en­gaged. The down­side is your com­mu­ni­ca­tion style is a bit more con­fus­ing.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your in­tu­ition is a pow­er­ful force, so push your­self to learn more about those around you. Ev­ery­thing should make more sense.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Try hard not to get an­gry – you may get nee­dled by more than one per­son. Make sure your en­ergy is kept in re­serve.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You are a hair’s breadth from get­ting over­whelmed. The good news is you should clear off some space in just a few days.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Help your col­leagues and friends get over their dra­mas. You can show them how to find refuge in their homes or of­fices.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>A dream mes­sage is more im­por­tant than you re­alise, so make sure to jot it down or oth­er­wise com­mit it to mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) An over­heard story brings in­spi­ra­tion, so eaves­drop as much as you can. New re­la­tion­ships are pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is best di­rected out­wards, so of­fer to help any­one you think needs you the most. You may find you have to act first.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your spir­i­tual side is deeply en­gaged with the world, so much so that you may end up wan­der­ing off task. Ex­pe­ri­ence life in a new way.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on per­sonal needs and is­sues. There is noth­ing self­ish about it – you get more done when you are fully com­mit­ted.</p>
