    <p>A for­mer ad­min­is­tra­tive man­ager at a wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tion em­bez­zled funds, forged bank state­ments and gam­bled with her ill­got­ten gains for five years be­fore she was caught.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Chin Nyuk Khuen, 66, was sen­tenced to 30 months’ jail af­ter she was found guilty of three charges of crim­i­nal breach of trust, one charge of com­mit­ting forgery and one charge of fraud. Five other charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Chin, who ap­peared in court us­ing a wheel­chair, suf­fers from re­nal dis­ease and this was a mit­i­ga­tion fac­tor in her sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2013 and 2018, Chin mis­ap­pro­pri­ated $287,290 from Char Yang (Dabu) Lee Chee As­so­ci­a­tion, which pro­vides wel­fare to the Hakka com­mu­nity, by col­lect­ing and keep­ing rent and event pay­ments. She then spent the sum on gam­bling and var­i­ous per­sonal ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Her crimes were dis­cov­ered af­ter the for­mer trea­surer of Char Yang (Dabu) Lee Chee As­so­ci­a­tion filed a po­lice re­port on Jan 30 last year.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that there is another Hakka as­so­ci­a­tion – the Char Yong (Dabu) As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore. The two as­so­ci­a­tions are un­re­lated.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Char Yang (Dabu) Lee Chee As­so­ci­a­tion’s main source of rev­enue was rental in­come from prop­er­ties it leased to ten­ants. As the ad­min­is­tra­tive man­ager, Chin col­lected the rent, pre­pared re­ceipt vouch­ers for it, and de­posited the pay­ments into the as­so­ci­a­tion’s OCBC Bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Fe­bru­ary 2016 and De­cem­ber 2018, she re­ceived and kept rental pay­ments amount­ing to $225,900 from two ten­ants, and later spent the money on gam­bling and per­sonal ex­penses, and treat­ing her friends to meals.</p>
    <p>To con­ceal the crimes, Chin forged bank state­ments by us­ing Mi­crosoft Word to cre­ate a ta­ble of trans­ac­tion de­tails sim­i­lar to ac­tual OCBC ac­count state­ments. Within this ta­ble, she in­cluded false cash de­posits from the rental pay­ments, event pay­ments col­lected from mem­bers who at­tended events or­gan­ised by the as­so­ci­a­tion, as well as a false ac­count balance.</p>
    <p>She then printed the ta­ble, placed it on top of an orig­i­nal OCBC ac­count state­ment, and pho­to­copied the two doc­u­ments to­gether so that the fi­nal doc­u­ment would have the OCBC let­ter­head and footer with the forged ta­ble of trans­ac­tion de­tails.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Jan­uary 2014 and Au­gust 2018, she made 44 forg­eries. The to­tal value of the false en­tries was $158,030.</p>
    <p>Chin, who was un­rep­re­sented in court, also fal­si­fied re­ceipt vouch­ers to in­di­cate that the as­so­ci­a­tion had re­ceived the pay­ments. From May 2013 to Au­gust 2018, a to­tal of 73 re­ceipt vouch­ers were fal­si­fied and the as­so­ci­a­tion lost $287,290.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing, Dis­trict Judge Ng Peng Hong took Chin’s med­i­cal con­di­tion into ac­count and noted that she will be able to re­ceive dial­y­sis treat­ment while serv­ing her jail term.</p>
