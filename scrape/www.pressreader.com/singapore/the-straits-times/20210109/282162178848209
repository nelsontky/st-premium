    <p>I am writ­ing in re­la­tion to the news analysis piece by global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal (De­tails elu­sive amid re­lief over EU’s trade deal with Bri­tain,</p>
    <p>Dec 27, 2020) that mis­rep­re­sents sev­eral el­e­ments re­lated to the newly ne­go­ti­ated EU-UK Trade and Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment, which I would like to com­ment on.</p>
    <p>First of all, Mr Eyal as­sumes that the EU-UK agree­ment needs to be rat­i­fied by the na­tional Par­lia­ments of the 27 Euro­pean Union mem­ber states.</p>
    <p>How­ever, on the EU side, the agree­ment re­quires only the con­sent of the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment and no sep­a­rate rat­i­fi­ca­tion by na­tional Par­lia­ments. The na­tional Par­lia­ments were reg­u­larly in­formed about the progress in the ne­go­ti­a­tions with the United King­dom, and EU mem­ber states unan­i­mously ap­proved the sig­na­ture and pro­vi­sional ap­pli­ca­tion of the agree­ment in the Council of the Euro­pean Union on Dec 29 last year.</p>
    <p>This once again showed the un­prece­dented unity with which the 27 EU mem­ber states ap­proached the Brexit ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the ar­ti­cle de­scribes the trade part of the EU-UK agree­ment as “the most sig­nif­i­cant sin­gle trade agree­ment Europe has ever con­tem­plated”. This state­ment ig­nores the fact that this agree­ment is per­haps the first that does not im­prove the trad­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween the par­ties.</p>
    <p>In­stead of elim­i­nat­ing trade bar­ri­ers, which would usu­ally be ex­pected from a trade deal, it in­tro­duces bar­ri­ers by cre­at­ing a re­la­tion­ship that is far in­fe­rior to the one that the UK and the EU en­joyed pre­vi­ously (that is, dur­ing UK’s mem­ber­ship in the EU).</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the UK’s de­ci­sion to leave the EU sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union, the agree­ment will help in lim­it­ing the dis­rup­tions as com­pared with a sit­u­a­tion with­out an agree­ment be­ing in place, but it will be far less beneficial.</p>
    <p>Third, Mr Eyal in­di­cates that as a re­sult of the fi­nal­i­sa­tion of the agree­ment, “peo­ple and goods will con­tinue to move freely be­tween the UK and Europe, and few will no­tice any dif­fer­ence”.</p>
    <p>While the con­se­quences might not be as vis­i­ble on the first days of this year, they are real and will be­come no­tice­able over time.</p>
    <p>Let me give just a few ex­am­ples. When it comes to the move­ment of peo­ple, UK visi­tors to the EU will now re­quire visas for stays over 90 days in a 180-day pe­riod, and will no longer ben­e­fit from the free­dom to work, study, start a busi­ness or live in the EU with­out ob­tain­ing the nec­es­sary per­mits.</p>
    <p>Even with the new agree­ment in place, busi­nesses will no longer be able to ben­e­fit from the free move­ment of goods and will face new trade bar­ri­ers, lead­ing to in­creased costs and re­quir­ing ad­just­ments to in­te­grated EU-UK sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Cus­toms for­mal­i­ties and checks on UK goods en­ter­ing the EU have been rein­tro­duced, which in turn will lead to more bor­der de­lays and im­pact on just-in-time de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Value-added tax and ex­cise du­ties due upon im­por­ta­tion to the EU will have to be paid on UK goods (also those pur­chased on­line).</p>
    <p>UK food ex­ports must have valid health cer­tifi­cates and bor­der checks will be car­ried out sys­tem­at­i­cally, which was not the case be­fore.</p>
    <p>The com­ple­tion of the EU-UK Trade and Co­op­er­a­tion</p>
    <p>Agree­ment pro­vides a solid ba­sis for pre­serv­ing our long­stand­ing friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion with the UK and should be wel­comed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, one has to ac­knowl­edge that it will by no means match the level of eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion that ex­isted while the</p>
    <p>UK was an EU mem­ber state. Bar­bara Plink­ert</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union Am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>GLOBAL AF­FAIRS COR­RE­SPON­DENT JONATHAN EYAL’S RE­PLY:</p>
    <p>Am­bas­sador Plink­ert is right to cor­rect me on the ques­tion of who needs to rat­ify the deal con­cluded be­tween the EU and the UK.</p>
    <p>She is also right to enu­mer­ate all the dif­fer­ences be­tween the rights and obli­ga­tions the UK en­joyed as a full EU mem­ber and those the gov­ern­ment in Lon­don will en­joy un­der the re­cently con­cluded treaty.</p>
    <p>But she is wrong to crit­i­cise me for ap­pear­ing to gloss over these dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>I did write that, as a re­sult of the treaty, peo­ple and goods will con­tinue to move freely.</p>
    <p>How­ever, that pas­sage was writ­ten in the con­text of the pre­vi­ous dooms­day sce­nar­ios about po­ten­tially cat­a­strophic dis­rup­tions at EU-UK bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Yet in all other places, I made ex­plicit ref­er­ences to the dif­fer­ences be­tween the new treaty and the UK’s pre­vi­ous sta­tus.</p>
    <p>Read­ing Am­bas­sador Plink­ert’s ex­ten­sive let­ter, one is tempted to con­clude that its real ob­jec­tive is not just to cor­rect my sin­gle in­ac­cu­racy, but to per­suade read­ers that the UK ended up pay­ing a heavy price for its de­par­ture from the EU.</p>
    <p>That may, of course, be true.</p>
    <p>And it re­mains a per­fectly jus­ti­fi­able po­si­tion for an</p>
    <p>EU en­voy to take.</p>
    <p>But even though, as a cit­i­zen of sev­eral coun­tries, I owe per­sonal al­le­giance to both the UK and the EU, it was not a mes­sage that I felt was up to me to con­vey.</p>
