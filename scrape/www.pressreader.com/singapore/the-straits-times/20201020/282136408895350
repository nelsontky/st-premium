    <p>When it comes to dis­cus­sions on China and events in the South China Sea, I think one should first un­der­stand the con­text and seek to un­der­stand the points of view of the var­i­ous par­ties in­volved (China’s ac­tions key fac­tor for peace in South China Sea, by</p>
    <p>Mr Toh Cheng Seong, Oct 16).</p>
    <p>China was not the first to mil­i­tarise the South China Sea, nor was it the first to do land recla­ma­tion in that area. It sim­ply had more re­sources to do them on a much larger scale.</p>
    <p>It is of­ten high­lighted that</p>
    <p>Chi­nese President Xi Jin­ping re­neged on a pledge not to mil­i­tarise the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Yes, dur­ing a joint press con­fer­ence with US President Barack Obama in Septem­ber 2015, Mr Xi did say that China “does not in­tend to pur­sue mil­i­tari­sa­tion” of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>In the months af­ter that, the United States re­peat­edly sent war­ships that sailed close to Chi­nese po­si­tions in the South China Sea, cit­ing free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion. Le­gal­ity aside, I won­der how a fair-minded per­son would re­act if some­one comes loi­ter­ing out­side that per­son’s gate bran­dish­ing as­sault weapons?</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, China is sur­rounded by US mil­i­tary bases, many of them hosted by coun­tries that are claimants of ter­ri­to­ries in the South China Sea. I find it ironic that these coun­tries now fret about Chi­nese mil­i­tary build-up.</p>
    <p>It should also be noted that while China has stated its com­mit­ment to the path of peace­ful de­vel­op­ment, it has never promised benev­o­lence.</p>
