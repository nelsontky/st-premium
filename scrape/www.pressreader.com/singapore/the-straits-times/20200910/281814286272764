    <p>LON­DON • All so­cial gath­er­ings of more than six peo­ple will be banned in Eng­land, un­der new lim­its an­nounced by Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son yes­ter­day, as coro­n­avirus cases grow.</p>
    <p>Po­lice will have new pow­ers to dis­perse and fine any group larger than six meet­ing in­doors or out­doors from next Mon­day. That marks a tight­en­ing of the cur­rent rules, un­der which po­lice can break up gath­er­ings of more than 30.</p>
    <p>A new pub­lic in­for­ma­tion cam­paign was also launched to em­pha­sise the im­por­tance of hand wash­ing, the use of face cov­er­ings and main­tain­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>There will be ex­cep­tions for peo­ple get­ting to­gether for work, wed­dings and fu­ner­als as well as for or­gan­ised sports – but par­ties in pubs and restau­rants, and gath­er­ings in pub­lic spa­ces, will all be hit by the new lim­its.</p>
    <p>“We need to act now to stop the virus spread­ing,” Mr John­son said in com­ments be­fore an ex­pected news con­fer­ence later yes­ter­day. “We are sim­pli­fy­ing and strength­en­ing the rules on so­cial con­tact – mak­ing them eas­ier to un­der­stand and for the po­lice to en­force.”</p>
    <p>The move comes amid mount­ing con­cern in the gov­ern­ment that Covid-19 cases are ris­ing rapidly again, af­ter re­stric­tions were eased and the pub­lic was en­cour­aged to re­turn to work and so­cialise.</p>
    <p>It is po­ten­tially a blow to Bri­tain’s econ­omy, which is al­ready fac­ing its deep­est re­ces­sion in at least 100 years.</p>
    <p>The lat­est lim­its will af­fect the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor in par­tic­u­lar, which the gov­ern­ment tried to boost with dis­counts for din­ing out last month.</p>
    <p>The rise in cases in Bri­tain, which has seen around 3,000 con­firmed daily in­fec­tions in re­cent days, fol­lows sim­i­lar in­creases in re­cent weeks in other Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>More than 41,500 peo­ple con­firmed to have the coro­n­avirus have died in Bri­tain, the worst toll in Europe. The death rate has now fallen to its low­est level since mid-March, but the re­cent in­crease in new in­fec­tions has caused con­cern.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters hope that act­ing now to limit so­cial gath­er­ings will slow the spread of the dis­ease as they aim to avoid an­other na­tional lock­down, such as the one im­posed in March that has plunged Bri­tain into its deep­est re­ces­sion on record.</p>
    <p>Un­der the mea­sures, po­lice will first try to en­cour­age groups larger than six peo­ple to dis­perse. If they refuse, they will face a £100 (S$177) fine that will dou­ble on each fur­ther re­peat of­fence, up to £3,200.</p>
    <p>“It is ab­so­lutely crit­i­cal that peo­ple now abide by these rules and re­mem­ber the ba­sics – wash­ing your hands, cov­er­ing your face, keep­ing space from oth­ers, and get­ting a test if you have symp­toms,” Mr John­son said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish of­fi­cials worry that Bri­tain is go­ing to fol­low Spain and France, where hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions have be­gun to in­crease.</p>
    <p>A lo­calised ap­proach has taken hold.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, min­is­ters an­nounced tight­en­ing of re­stric­tions in the north­ern English town of Bolton af­ter a “very sig­nif­i­cant rise” in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock said con­tact trac­ing data had shown this was “partly due to so­cial­is­ing by peo­ple in their 20s and 30s”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter iden­ti­fy­ing a num­ber of pubs as hot spots, he an­nounced curbs on hos­pi­tal­ity venues, in­clud­ing re­duced open­ing hours, and a ban on lo­cal res­i­dents so­cial­is­ing with peo­ple out­side their house­hold.</p>
    <p>One con­cern for min­is­ters is that the rules are be­ing flouted by young peo­ple, who may not be at great risk them­selves but who then pass the coro­n­avirus on to their more vul­ner­a­ble re­la­tions.</p>
