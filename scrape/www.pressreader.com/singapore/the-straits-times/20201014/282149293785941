    <p>It trou­bled me to read Ms Low Kar Tiang’s ac­count of her quar­an­tine ex­pe­ri­ence at a five-star re­sort ho­tel, from com­plain­ing about the food to the cheap-smelling soft­ener (Win­ning the quar­an­tine lot­tery at Rasa Sen­tosa, Oct 11).</p>
    <p>Granted she did have some good things to say about the ho­tel. Still, one ought to re­mem­ber that the main idea be­hind ded­i­cated stay-home no­tice (SHN) fa­cil­i­ties – in this case, ho­tels – is to pre­vent po­ten­tial spread of in­fec­tion from re­turnees to their fam­ily mem­bers, and not an ex­tended stay­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels have been hit badly by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and with the open­ing of ho­tels for staycation­s, it is hard for them to man­age the room in­ven­tory as they have to ad­here to SHN guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Hence, it is un­der­stand­able that the writer’s re­quest for a room with a sea view was turned down.</p>
    <p>It pains me to know that the ef­forts of our Gov­ern­ment and the ho­tel amid cost-cut­ting mea­sures have led to this.</p>
    <p>I hope the writer un­der­stands how for­tu­nate she was to have a com­fort­able 14-day stay and to have had clean laun­dered clothes while the na­tion fights against big­ger things dur­ing this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, do spare a thought for ho­tels which we know are badly affected by this cri­sis.</p>
