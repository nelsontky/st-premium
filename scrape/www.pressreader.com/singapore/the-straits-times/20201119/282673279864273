    </section>

    <p>COME­BACK ON THE CARDS?: Tai­wanese en­ter­tainer Show Lo was dropped from sev­eral Chi­nese va­ri­ety shows after his ex-girl­friend,</p>
    <p>Grace Chow, wrote an ex­plo­sive post on Weibo in April.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old Chi­nese in­flu­encer an­nounced that she had bro­ken up with Lo, 41, for some time.</p>
    <p>She went on to ac­cuse the singer-host of cheating on her, host­ing sex par­ties and hav­ing “im­proper re­la­tions” with Linda Chien, one of his co-hosts on long-run­ning va­ri­ety pro­gramme 100% En­ter­tain­ment (1997 to present).</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Lo posted on In­sta­gram a selfie pos­si­bly taken in a make-up room for artists.</p>
    <p>He wrote in Chi­nese: “Ev­ery­thing has be­come fa­mil­iar after com­ing to a fa­mil­iar en­vi­ron­ment and meet­ing fa­mil­iar peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>In the past, his posts were usu­ally of him either play­ing golf or bas­ket­ball.</p>
    <p>He did not dis­close when his lat­est photo was taken, but a come­back might not go smoothly, judg­ing from the re­ac­tions of Chi­nese ne­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>Some have not for­got­ten his mis­deeds and called for boy­cotts if he were to have new projects.</p>
    <p>A re­cent Tai­wanese me­dia re­port said Lo was wait­ing for the right op­por­tu­nity to make a come­back after he turned down an op­por­tu­nity to host an out­door va­ri­ety show.</p>
