    <p>Par­ents know they need to be in­volved in their chil­dren’s devel­op­ment and ed­u­ca­tion for bet­ter out­comes.</p>
    <p>But it is hard to know if they are go­ing about it the right way and whether it is likely to reap ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>This is where The Straits Times’ Smart Par­ent­ing aims to play a part and make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The site (str.sg/smart­par­ent­ing) be­ing launched to­day will give par­ents deeply re­searched in­for­ma­tion on what they can do to help their child thrive.</p>
    <p>Un­like the frag­ments of par­ent­ing ad­vice found across the In­ter­net, ST’s team of ed­u­ca­tion and par­ent­ing re­porters will search out ex­perts in dif­fer­ent fields and get them to ex­plain, ver­ify and give ad­vice to par­ents that will be use­ful and fo­cused.</p>
    <p>ST re­porters will also seek out of­fi­cials and ex­perts at the min­istries and other rel­e­vant agen­cies to ex­plain schemes and poli­cies.</p>
    <p>For our in­au­gu­ral is­sue and over the next few weeks, we have de­cided to fo­cus on read­ing. Be­cause if there is one thing that par­ents can do to help their chil­dren suc­ceed in school and life, it would be to im­merse them in read­ing.</p>
    <p>I am sure many par­ents have been given this ad­vice. But how many par­ents know about the re­search be­hind it, and how com­pelling the ev­i­dence is? We will dis­til the re­search to sieve out what is im­por­tant for par­ents to know.</p>
    <p>But once par­ents learn how im­por­tant it is to get their chil­dren to de­velop the read­ing habit, what do they do next? Mind you, the re­search also shows that it is not just read­ing, but also read­ing for plea­sure that makes the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>In the fol­low­ing weeks, we will guide par­ents on prac­ti­cal steps that can go a long way.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, not many par­ents know that for very young chil­dren, it is best to use printed books rather than e-books. We will pre­sent our read­ers with the ev­i­dence be­hind it, where chil­dren read­ing dif­fer­ent print and e-books were mon­i­tored by mag­netic res­o­nance imag­ing ma­chines.</p>
    <p>ST Smart Par­ent­ing will also guide par­ents on how to de­velop the love of read­ing in chil­dren. How to se­lect the right books to get chil­dren hooked on read­ing and how dif­fi­cult or easy should the book be – all this will be cov­ered in ar­ti­cles in print, on­line and videos.</p>
    <p>For older chil­dren, with many of them ac­cess­ing in­for­ma­tion and re­sources on­line, there is a need to de­velop crit­i­cal read­ing skills.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents, es­pe­cially at the higher lev­els, do not go to pre-ap­proved text­books any­more. They are of­ten re­quired to go to mul­ti­ple sources on­line, in dif­fer­ent for­mats. They will have to com­pare, con­trast, eval­u­ate and draw on the sources to con­struct their own knowl­edge and un­der­stand­ing of a topic or is­sue.</p>
    <p>All this re­quires crit­i­cal think­ing and read­ing skills.</p>
    <p>Ms Les­lie Davis, a con­sul­tant with The Bri­tish Coun­cil Sin­ga­pore, will be shar­ing tips on how par­ents can help de­velop th­ese higher-or­der skills in their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The site al­ready has a li­brary of orig­i­nal con­tent, and the team will add to it ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>Over the next few months, we will cover var­i­ous top­ics of im­por­tance for par­ents – from the new scor­ing sys­tem for the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion to pick­ing the right sec­ondary school to choos­ing be­tween the ju­nior col­lege or polytech­nic route.</p>
    <p>We will also of­fer in­for­ma­tion and guid­ance on univer­sity op­tions, ad­dress­ing con­cerns on univer­sity costs and af­ford­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>There will be fea­tures from Life par­ent­ing re­porters on how to help par­ents deal with their chil­dren’s be­havioural is­sues and hu­man in­ter­est trend sto­ries such as one on the chal­lenges of rais­ing pre­ma­ture chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Also on the cards are guides for par­ents on things to do dur­ing the school hol­i­days and the best new play­grounds for kids.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther on, we plan to or­gan­ise talks, work­shops and fo­rums on var­i­ous top­ics.</p>
    <p>We will be send­ing out a weekly news­let­ter in­form­ing par­ents on what to look out for in ST Smart Par­ent­ing ev­ery week.</p>
