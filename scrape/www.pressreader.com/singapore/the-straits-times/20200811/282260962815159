    <p>MADRID • Atletico Madrid yes­ter­day con­ducted their fi­nal train­ing ses­sion ahead of their trip to the Cham­pi­ons League “Fi­nal Eight” tour­na­ment in Lis­bon af­ter the rest of their squad tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19, the club said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The club’s morn­ing ses­sion was post­poned and their plans to travel to the Por­tuguese cap­i­tal were ini­tially put on hold af­ter two of their play­ers tested pos­i­tive for the virus on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>But the Span­ish La Liga club said Diego Sime­one’s side would fly to Por­tu­gal to­day without Ar­gentina forward Angel Cor­rea and in­jured Croa­tia defender Sime Vr­saljko.</p>
    <p>Academy play­ers Alex dos Santos, Manu Sanchez, Riquelme and</p>
    <p>Toni Moya have been called up as re­place­ments.</p>
    <p>The club added: “The first team and mem­bers of the coach­ing staff un­der­went new tests yes­ter­day, the re­sult of which has been neg­a­tive in all of them, af­ter the ap­pear­ance of two pos­i­tive cases in the tests car­ried out on Saturday.”</p>
    <p>The pair, who are asymp­tomatic, are cur­rently self-iso­lat­ing at home af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>While Vr­saljko had al­ready been ruled out of Thurs­day’s quar­ter-fi­nal clash with Ger­man Bun­desliga out­fit RB Leipzig, the loss of Cor­rea will be a blow.</p>
    <p>He has been ever-present for Atletico, mak­ing 22 top-flight starts last sea­son and a fur­ther five in the Cham­pi­ons League, with six goals in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>There had been fears that the rest of the squad were ex­posed to the virus, which would have put their last-eight clash at risk, but they can now travel safely.</p>
    <p>Sime­one’s men, how­ever, will face an­other round of Covid-19 test­ing to­mor­row and the re­sults have to be in six hours be­fore the start of the match with Leipzig.</p>
    <p>The news that Atletico play­ers had been in­fected by Covid-19 sent shock­waves through their fan base, although it also prompted many sup­port­ers to leave abu­sive mes­sages on Thomas Le­mar’s so­cial me­dia pages.</p>
    <p>The France forward has been writ­ten off as a flop since his €70 mil­lion (S$113 mil­lion) move from</p>
    <p>Monaco in 2018, draw­ing the ire of many for his in­ef­fec­tual dis­plays.</p>
    <p>Among the jokes that were mak­ing the rounds on­line were ones wish­ing that it was Le­mar who caught the virus, lead­ing com­pa­triot Jules Kounde to lash out at the trolling.</p>
    <p>The Sevilla defender tweeted: “I’m see­ing mes­sages hop­ing it’s Thomas who has Covid. You’re truly shame­ful. Let’s have some re­spect when we’re talk­ing about hu­man life. This isn’t a joke.”</p>
    <p>Should Atletico get past Leipzig, they will meet ei­ther French Ligue 1 cham­pi­ons Paris Saint-Ger­main or Italy’s Ata­lanta in the last four. Atletico have never won the Cham­pi­ons League, los­ing in the 1974, 2014 and 2016 fi­nals.</p>
