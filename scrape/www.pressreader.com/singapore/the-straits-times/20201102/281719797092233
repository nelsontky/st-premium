    <p>NEW YORK • Most peo­ple ar­riv­ing in New York state must quar­an­tine for at least three full days be­fore tak­ing a coron­avirus test, Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo an­nounced as he over­hauled one of the strictest quar­an­tine regimes for trav­ellers in the United States.</p>
    <p>If that test comes back neg­a­tive, the trav­eller can leave quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The re­quire­ments, which take ef­fect on Wed­nes­day, will not ap­ply to res­i­dents of “con­tigu­ous” states, Mr Cuomo told re­porters on Satur­day, and there will be dif­fer­ent re­quire­ments for New York­ers who leave the state for less than 24 hours.</p>
    <p>He named Con­necti­cut, Penn­syl­va­nia and New Jersey as ex­am­ples of con­tigu­ous states, home to many com­muters to New York City.</p>
    <p>But it was un­clear whether neigh­bour­ing Ver­mont and Mas­sachusetts would also be ex­empt from the new regime.</p>
    <p>His of­fice did not re­ply to ques­tions seek­ing clar­i­fi­ca­tion on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple will also be re­quired to take a test that comes back neg­a­tive within the three days prior to head­ing to New York, the gov­er­nor said.</p>
    <p>If the se­cond test taken at least four days af­ter ar­rival is also neg­a­tive, “you can go about your busi­ness”, Mr Cuomo said in a tele­phone con­fer­ence with re­porters.</p>
    <p>If it is pos­i­tive, the per­son must re­main in iso­la­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>Those deemed es­sen­tial work­ers by the state, from nurses to gro­cery store work­ers, are ex­empt from the rules.</p>
    <p>The US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol (CDC) says the virus can in­cu­bate for up to 14 days be­fore some­one be­comes symp­to­matic and so rec­om­mends a 14-day quar­an­tine pe­riod af­ter a pos­si­ble ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>Un­der New York’s rule, a trav­eller could end his or her quar­an­tine just four days af­ter a pos­si­ble ex­po­sure – at the air­port, for ex­am­ple, or dur­ing a plane flight – de­spite the CDC not­ing that coron­avirus tests can re­turn a false neg­a­tive re­sult if taken too early in an in­cu­bat­ing in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Cuomo’s of­fice did not re­spond to ques­tions about how the rule squares with CDC guid­ance.</p>
    <p>New York­ers re­turn­ing to the state within 24 hours of leav­ing need not quar­an­tine, but must take a test within four days of their re­turn, Mr Cuomo said, though his of­fice later cor­rected that to say the test must not be taken sooner than four days af­ter re­turn­ing.</p>
    <p>If they are gone longer than 24 hours to non-con­tigu­ous states or on a trip abroad, then the gen­eral rules ap­ply.</p>
    <p>The new rules re­place a pre­vi­ous ar­range­ment un­der which peo­ple ar­riv­ing in New York from a list of states with wors­en­ing coron­avirus out­breaks had to quar­an­tine in a home or ho­tel for 14 days, re­gard­less of any test re­sult.</p>
    <p>That list grew to en­com­pass al­most ev­ery state in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, New York grap­pled with one of the world’s dead­li­est out­breaks of Covid-19, but now has one of the low­est rates of pos­i­tive tests of any state in the coun­try even as cases surge in other re­gions.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent statewide pos­i­tive test rate was 1.49 per cent, Mr Cuomo said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>New York­ers re­turn­ing to the state within 24 hours of leav­ing need not quar­an­tine, but must take a test within four days of their re­turn, Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo said, though his of­fice later cor­rected that to say the test must not be taken sooner than four days af­ter re­turn­ing. If they are gone longer than 24 hours to non-con­tigu­ous states or on a trip abroad, then the gen­eral rules ap­ply.</p>
