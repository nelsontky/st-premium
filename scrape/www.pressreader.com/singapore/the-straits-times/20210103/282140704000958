    <p>Bor­der clo­sures around the world can­not di­min­ish the love of travel. In­stead, es­capism has height­ened un­der lock­down and “wan­der­must” is now a travel su­pertrend for 2021.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, Mr Gavin Toll­man, chief ex­ec­u­tive of global travel com­pany Trafal­gar, has named nine changes in the world of travel, with wan­der­must top­ping the list.</p>
    <p>“Our time at home has made us crave the world out­side more than ever,’’ he wrote in a blog post.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects an un­prece­dented surge in de­mand for travel, adding: “Travel is no longer some­thing we lust for – it is in­stead a fun­da­men­tal ne­ces­sity. We must travel again.”</p>
    <p>His point seems borne out by dig­i­tal travel com­pany Book­ing. com, which re­cently sur­veyed 20,000 trav­ellers across 28 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Among those polled in Sin­ga­pore, 76 per cent say they es­pe­cially ap­pre­ci­ate travel now and will no longer take it for granted. This ex­ceeds the global av­er­age of 61 per cent.</p>
    <p>Both Sin­ga­pore (41 per cent) and Hong Kong (55 per cent) are among the Asia-Pa­cific coun­tries with the most re­spon­dents plan­ning to travel more in the fu­ture to make up for “lost time” last year.</p>
    <p>“This could be due to how both mar­kets have tra­di­tion­ally been more re­liant on in­ter­na­tional travel, given their small size and well-con­nected ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion as key avi­a­tion hubs for the re­gion,’’ con­cluded the Book­ing. com re­port.</p>
    <p>Wan­der­must is one of those fancy port­man­teau words that the travel i ndus­try l oves to i nvent, along with stay­ca­tion and glam­p­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Still, wan­der­must has some ba­sis in science.</p>
    <p>Low-cost car­rier Scoot, which de­fines wan­der­must as “the in­nate need that hu­mans have to travel and seek new ex­pe­ri­ences”, part­nered a renowned re­searcher in 2018 to probe the link be­tween genes and the hu­man de­sire to wan­der afar.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans were tested for a gene vari­ant known as DRD4-7R – a re­cep­tor that con­trols the body’s dopamine lev­els – for a glimpse of the ge­netic make-up of trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Hu­man be­hav­iour ge­neti­cist Richard Eb­stein, from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, said: “What we have are many genes, such as this one, that can ever so slightly change our per­son­al­i­ties and make us more likely to travel or develop a pas­sion for travel.”</p>
    <p>But, en­vi­ron­men­tal fac­tors are just as in­flu­en­tial, he added.</p>
    <p>Where will wan­der­must take the glo­be­trot­ter in 2021?</p>
    <p>While the world will never run out of won­ders for trav­ellers, a cou­ple of sub-trends, en­cap­su­lat­ing safety and well-be­ing, stand out.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, va­ca­tions in the great out­doors are be­ing pri­ori­tised over crowded cities. This has been the case for do­mes­tic trav­ellers in coun­tries like the United States, China and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Mr Toll­man from Trafal­gar high­lights des­ti­na­tions that de­liver on “wide open spa­ces, fresh air, a chance to get into na­ture, and a way of avoid­ing crowds”.</p>
    <p>He adds: “When bor­ders lift, I am con­fi­dent we will see a resur­gence in des­ti­na­tions such as New Zealand and Switzer­land that will shoot to the top of the ‘must visit now’ lists.”</p>
    <p>Other big bucket-list va­ca­tions that travel com­pa­nies project will be hot range from Por­tu­gal surf­ing for mil­len­ni­als to edge-of-world im­mer­sion in Patag­o­nia.</p>
    <p>Ex­pe­ri­en­tial travel com­pany &Be­yond fo­cuses on ris­ing or reignited trends, such as the art of slow travel and pri­vate “travel bub­bles” of friends and fam­i­lies go­ing away to re­mote places. “Pri­vacy is the new lux­ury,” it de­clares in a re­cent news release.</p>
    <p>Among the lodges on its list for the af­flu­ent is the Ngala Tree­house in South Africa, where guests can</p>
    <p>slum­ber al fresco un­der the stars, “far from Wi-Fi and ar­ti­fi­cial light”, or en­joy sun­downer drinks off the grid in safety.</p>
    <p>The style of wan­der­must this year is summed up el­e­gantly by New York-based Finn Part­ners, a global in­te­grated public re­la­tions and mar­ket­ing agency, in its Catchon Trend Re­port 2021. “As we con­tem­plate the prospect of jour­neys ahead, the fu­ture of travel will be safe, slower, soul­ful, se­cluded, and sus­tain­able,” it writes.</p>
    <p>This kind of travel can play out in a mul­ti­tude of ways, for in­stance, yacht char­ter ex­pe­ri­ences for small groups on a lux­ury phin­isi like Dunia Baru, which is Sin­ga­porean-owned and sails to farflung places in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Other wan­der­must pos­si­bil­i­ties cited in the Catchon re­port in­clude religious pil­grim­ages, restora­tive re­treats and, again, New Zealand, a place of phe­nom­e­nal beauty that also earned global praise for how its lead­er­ship han­dled the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Pow­er­ing the wan­der­must is the roll-out of Covid-19 vac­cines across the globe.</p>
    <p>Mr Joon Aun Ooi, pres­i­dent and manag­ing di­rec­tor for South East Asia and Pa­cific Rim for Wyn­d­ham Ho­tels & Re­sorts, says: “The suc­cess­ful roll-out of the vac­cine will en­able peo­ple to pro­vide proof of im­mu­nity and a clean bill of health, which will help re­build con­fi­dence in travel and fa­cil­i­tate the re­open­ing of bor­ders.”</p>
    <p>While the coro­n­avirus vac­cine will in­vig­o­rate travel, the im­pact may be very gen­tle at first with start-stop glo­be­trot­ting.</p>
    <p>Give it some time. Then ex­pect wan­der­must to take full flight.</p>
