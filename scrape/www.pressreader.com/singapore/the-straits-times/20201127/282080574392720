    <p>The first of­fice for Sin­ga­pore’s pi­o­neer po­lice­men was an at­tap house near the Sin­ga­pore River.</p>
    <p>Sim­ple as it was in its con­struc­tion, the house was al­ready a step up for the 12 men in the force formed in 1820, as they pre­vi­ously had to re­port for work at the res­i­dence of the of­fi­cer in charge, who was the sonin-law of Wil­liam Far­quhar, Sin­ga­pore’s first Bri­tish Res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>To­day, the 15,000-strong force re­port for work at nu­mer­ous mul­ti­storeyed com­plexes lo­cated around the is­land, in­clud­ing the sprawl­ing Po­lice Can­ton­ment Com­plex in New Bridge Road.</p>
    <p>The first po­lice of­fice has long been de­mol­ished, but the pub­lic can now walk to the site where it once stood, as part of a her­itage trail the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force</p>
    <p>launched yes­ter­day to mark its 200th an­niver­sary this year.</p>
    <p>The trail cov­ers nine sites cen­tral to the force’s op­er­a­tions in the past two cen­turies, in Chi­na­town and the Cen­tral Busi­ness District.</p>
    <p>The start of the trail is marked by a phys­i­cal marker in front of the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum, which is near the site of the first po­lice of­fice. Vis­i­tors can walk to the Kreta Ayer Neigh­bour­hood Po­lice Post, one of the sites, to see a per­ma­nent ex­hi­bi­tion on the trail and the evo­lu­tion of the area around it.</p>
    <p>An­other site of in­ter­est is the for­mer Traf­fic Po­lice head­quar­ters in Maxwell Road, home to the Traf­fic Po­lice for 69 years from 1930. It has been re­fur­bished and is now the Maxwell Cham­bers Suites, which houses le­gal in­sti­tu­tions and firms.</p>
    <p>Other sites in­clude the Lower Bar­racks in Pearl’s Hill, which used to house the po­lice’s Sikh Con­tin­gent in 1934 un­til it was dis­banded in 1946.</p>
    <p>It then served as the po­lice head­quar­ters and housed their ra­dio division and Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion De­part­ment from 1946, un­til the last division moved out in 2001. The Lower Bar­racks build­ing is con­served, and is now a com­mer­cial build­ing.</p>
