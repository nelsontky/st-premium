    <p>COPEN­HAGEN • The au­thor of one of the most am­bi­tious cli­mate plans in the Euro­pean Union says 2020 was a turn­ing point that has left him op­ti­mistic about the fu­ture of the planet.</p>
    <p>Al­though the year showed the scale of the ef­fort needed – with tem­per­a­tures ris­ing de­spite lock­downs across the world that brought most economies to a vir­tual stand­still – Dan­ish Cli­mate Min­is­ter Dan Jor­gensen says there is cause to be more up­beat.</p>
    <p>He points to the EU’s lat­est cli­mate deal and the US elec­tion, which will bring the world’s big­gest econ­omy back into the Paris pact.</p>
    <p>“It is re­mark­able that clos­ing down our so­ci­eties has not led us any­where near the level of re­duc­tions we need, so be­havioural changes alone won’t do it,” Mr Jor­gensen said in an in­ter­view in Copen­hagen. But while the anal­y­sis is of­ten neg­a­tive, “there are rea­sons for op­ti­mism and to cel­e­brate as well”, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Jor­gensen ended the year with a pledge to cease oil ex­plo­ration in the EU’s big­gest crude pro­ducer. The move prompted Green­peace to say, “this is what cli­mate lead­er­ship looks like”, and is part of a plan to slash 70 per cent off Den­mark’s car­bon emis­sions by 2030, com­pared with 1990 lev­els. More am­bi­tious than the 55 per cent tar­geted by the EU, it puts the Danes at the fore­front of the bloc’s ef­forts to pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic trig­gered a wave of fis­cal re­lief that has opened the door to some of the bold­est cli­mate ini­tia­tives yet. Eight of the world’s 10 largest economies, in­clud­ing China and Ja­pan, have set goals to reach net-zero emis­sion within decades. US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den wants the United States to be car­bon neu­tral by 2050.</p>
    <p>Mr Jor­gensen said: “We are go­ing to spend bil­lions of eu­ros on eco­nomic re­cov­ery in Europe and if we are smart and in­vest in green in­fra­struc­ture and en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, some­thing good can ac­tu­ally come of this.”</p>
    <p>Den­mark’s path to­wards a car­bon-neu­tral econ­omy sug­gests there are fi­nan­cial re­wards to be reaped. The coun­try started in­vest­ing heav­ily in wind en­ergy in the 1970s. It now gets over 40 per cent of its elec­tric­ity from wind power.</p>
    <p>Den­mark is home to the world’s big­gest wind-tur­bine maker, Ves­tas Wind Sys­tems, and the world’s top de­vel­oper of off­shore wind parks, Orsted. The lat­ter, which is half owned by the gov­ern­ment, started off as a state oil and gas pro­ducer, but rein­vented it­self half a decade ago. Since then, its value has soared about 430 per cent.</p>
    <p>Aside from Den­mark’s de­ci­sion to phase out its North Sea oil pro­duc­tion, and end it to­tally by 2050, the coun­try made sev­eral other com­mit­ments last year. These in­clude plans to build two is­lands to house the in­fra­struc­ture for new off­shore wind farms, help­ing Den­mark move closer to its ul­ti­mate goal of gen­er­at­ing all its elec­tric­ity from re­new­able en­ergy sources.</p>
    <p>The So­cial Demo­crat gov­ern­ment Mr Jor­gensen is part of has also had its crit­ics when it comes to the cli­mate. Prime Min­is­ter Mette Fred­erik­sen has been ac­cused of shy­ing away from us­ing taxes to steer con­sumers and busi­nesses to­wards en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly be­hav­iour. And ef­forts to pro­mote elec­tric ve­hi­cles were slammed for lack­ing am­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment has ar­gued that in­vest­ing in new tech­nolo­gies will ul­ti­mately prove the best way to bring about change.</p>
    <p>Mr Jor­gensen says pol­i­cy­mak­ers need to keep the pub­lic on their side. He points to France, where pro­test­ers in 2018 donned yel­low vests and took to the streets for months, an­gered by hikes in fuel prices.</p>
    <p>The high cost of achiev­ing cli­mate goals means “we need to think hard about how to approach it”, Mr Jor­gensen said. The hope is that Den­mark can be­come a model for oth­ers to fol­low, he added.</p>
    <p>“If our plan would re­sult in a de­cline in pro­duc­tion or clos­ing down some in­dus­tries, no other coun­tries would think our plan was a good idea.”</p>
