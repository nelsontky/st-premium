    <p>A newly de­vel­oped blood test for Alzheimer’s has di­ag­nosed the dis­ease as ac­cu­rately as meth­ods that are far more ex­pen­sive or in­va­sive, sci­en­tists have re­ported, a sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards a long-time goal for pa­tients, doc­tors and de­men­tia re­searchers.</p>
    <p>The test has the po­ten­tial to make di­ag­no­sis sim­ple, af­ford­able and widely avail­able.</p>
    <p>The test de­ter­mined whether peo­ple with de­men­tia had Alzheimer’s in­stead of an­other con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>And it iden­ti­fied signs of the de­gen­er­a­tive, deadly dis­ease 20 years be­fore mem­ory and think­ing prob­lems were ex­pected in peo­ple with a ge­netic mu­ta­tion that causes Alzheimer’s, ac­cord­ing to re­search pub­lished in Jama Net­work Open and pre­sented at the Alzheimer’s As­so­ci­a­tion In­ter­na­tional Con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Such a test could be avail­able for clin­i­cal use in as lit­tle as two to three years, the re­searchers and other ex­perts es­ti­mated, pro­vid­ing an af­ford­able, sim­ple way to di­ag­nose whether peo­ple with cog­ni­tive is­sues were ex­pe­ri­enc­ing Alzheimer’s, rather than an­other type of de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>A blood test like this might also even­tu­ally be used to pre­dict whether some­one with no symp­toms would de­velop Alzheimer’s.</p>
    <p>“This blood test very, very ac­cu­rately pre­dicts who’s got Alzheimer’s dis­ease in their brain, in­clud­ing peo­ple who seem to be nor­mal,” said Dr Michael Weiner, an Alzheimer’s dis­ease re­searcher at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, San Fran­cisco, who was not in­volved in the study.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a cure, it’s not a treat­ment, but you can’t treat the dis­ease with­out be­ing able to di­ag­nose it. And ac­cu­rate, low-cost di­ag­no­sis is re­ally ex­cit­ing, so it’s a break­through.”</p>
    <p>Blood tests for Alzheimer’s, which are be­ing de­vel­oped by sev­eral re­search teams, would pro­vide some hope in a field that has ex­pe­ri­enced fail­ure af­ter fail­ure in its search for ways to treat and pre­vent a dev­as­tat­ing dis­ease that robs peo­ple of their mem­o­ries and abil­ity to func­tion in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>The test, which mea­sures a form of the tau pro­tein found in tan­gles that spread through­out the brain in Alzheimer’s, proved re­mark­ably ac­cu­rate in a study of 1,402 peo­ple from three dif­fer­ent groups in Swe­den, Colom­bia and the United States.</p>
    <p>It per­formed bet­ter than MRI (mag­netic res­o­nance imag­ing) brain scans, was as good as PET (positron emis­sion to­mog­ra­phy) scans or spinal taps, and was nearly as ac­cu­rate as the most de­fin­i­tive di­ag­nos­tic method: au­top­sies that found strong ev­i­dence of Alzheimer’s in peo­ple’s brains af­ter they died.</p>
