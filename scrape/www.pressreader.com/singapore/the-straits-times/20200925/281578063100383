    <p>Vet­eran coach Steven Quek, who is a wit­ness for marathoner Soh Rui Yong (right), told the court yes­ter­day that he did not see</p>
    <p>Ash­ley Liew slow down dur­ing the 2015 SEA Games marathon. Liew is su­ing Soh for defamation af­ter the lat­ter dis­puted Liew’s ac­count of an act of sports­man­ship at the Games.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran run­ning coach Steven Quek told the court yes­ter­day that he did not see Ash­ley Liew slow down dur­ing the 2015 SEA Games marathon.</p>
    <p>The 52-year-old, who has been coach­ing track and field for 33 years, ap­peared as a wit­ness for two-time Games marathon cham­pion Soh Rui Yong, whom he had coached from the time the lat­ter was a stu­dent at Raf­fles Ju­nior Col­lege un­til he was in the sec­ond year of his stud­ies at the Na­tional University of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Liew, 33, is ac­cus­ing Soh of de­fam­ing him in five in­stances via com­ments made on so­cial me­dia and is seek­ing $120,000 in dam­ages.</p>
    <p>The dis­pute be­tween the two ath­letes be­gan in Oc­to­ber 2018, when Soh, in a Face­book post, dis­puted Liew’s ac­count of an in­ci­dent that oc­curred dur­ing the 2015 SEA Games marathon, where Liew said he had slowed down to al­low other run­ners to catch up af­ter they missed a U-turn and took the wrong path.</p>
    <p>Liew, a chi­ro­prac­tor, later re­ceived two awards for his act of sports­man­ship and praise from Cabi­net min­is­ters, in­clud­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong in his 2015 Na­tional Day Rally.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Quek said he was at East Coast Park to watch the race and had stood about 100m from the U-turn point.</p>
    <p>Liew’s lawyer, Mark Teng of That.Le­gal, put it to Quek dur­ing cross ex­am­i­na­tion that he would not have seen Liew slow down had he only done so af­ter pass­ing Quek, to which the coach replied: “Yes. Right where I was, it did not hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a query by District Judge Lee Li Choon on what he meant in his af­fi­davit about not see­ing Liew stop or slow down, Quek later ex­plained that he had seen the pack of run­ners miss­ing the U-turn point, as well as Liew turn­ing at the cor­rect point and run­ning back to­wards his di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>He added: “At the point I was look­ing at him, at no point he was slow­ing down.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, Soh had de­nied that he made his claims about Liew’s act of sports­man­ship be­cause he was jeal­ous of his former na­tional team­mate.</p>
    <p>Teng had posited that Soh, 29, had made his com­ments about the in­ci­dent only in 2018 be­cause he was “jeal­ous” and felt he de­served more pub­lic­ity.</p>
    <p>“No, I did it be­cause it’s (Liew’s claim) un­true,” said Soh. “And it was brought up again and again.”</p>
    <p>Teng then brought up Soh’s own acts of sports­man­ship – at the 2012 Army Half-Marathon and the 2017 SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur – and asked if these had won Soh any awards, and if he had ex­pected Liew to earn so much pub­lic­ity from his act.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Soh said he did not know of any sports­man­ship awards be­fore Liew was awarded his. Liew was pre­sented the Pierre de Cou­bertin World Fair Play Tro­phy by the In­ter­na­tional Fair Play Com­mit­tee (IFPC) in Septem­ber 2016 and it was one of the two he re­ceived for his act of sports­man­ship.</p>
    <p>Soh dis­agreed with Teng’s as­ser­tions that he had made the state­ments against his client be­cause he “yearned to be recog­nised as a sports­man” and “wanted to be the only Sin­ga­porean marathoner talked about”.</p>
    <p>“I dis­agree be­cause all this is fram­ing of mo­tive, and I’m not jeal­ous of Ash­ley at all,” said Soh, who won the 2015 race and re­tained his ti­tle two years later.</p>
    <p>Later, when re-ex­am­ined by his own lawyer Clarence Lun of Fox­wood, Soh re­it­er­ated: “There’s noth­ing Ash­ley has that I would get jeal­ous about.”</p>
    <p>He also said that if he were jeal­ous that his own acts of sports­man­ship in 2012 and 2017 were not recog­nised in the form of an award, he would have made his state­ments pub­licly in 2017.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son I did (in 2018) was that (Liew’s claim) was re­peated by the IFPC, and I wanted to clar­ify with (them) on their Face­book page... How would I know it was go­ing to be picked up?” said Soh.</p>
    <p>THE TRUTH BE KNOWN</p>
    <p>I dis­agree be­cause all this is fram­ing of mo­tive... There’s noth­ing Ash­ley has that I would get jeal­ous about.</p>
    <p>SOH RUI YONG, two-time SEA Games marathon cham­pion, who in­sists that he spoke up about the in­ci­dent only in 2018 be­cause Ash­ley Liew’s claim was ‘un­true’ and brought up re­peat­edly.</p>
