    <p>A trial for Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s defama­tion law­suit against The On­line Ci­ti­zen (TOC) ed­i­tor Terry Xu con­cluded yes­ter­day af­ter Mr Xu’s lawyer Lim Tean briefly ques­tioned Ms Kwa Kim Li, who pre­pared six wills for the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
    <p>She took the stand in the af­ter­noon, af­ter her ap­pli­ca­tion to set aside a sub­poena was de­nied by Jus­tice Au­drey Lim in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Kwa, a man­ag­ing part­ner at the Lee and Lee law firm, is the niece of the late found­ing prime min­is­ter’s wife Kwa Geok Choo.</p>
    <p>While she had pre­pared Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s first six wills, Ms Kwa was cut out of the com­mu­ni­ca­tions for his sev­enth and fi­nal will.</p>
    <p>She has pre­vi­ously said that she did not pre­pare the last will.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the 40-minute hear­ing yes­ter­day, Mr Lim took Ms Kwa through a num­ber of e-mails that Mr Xu had re­lied on to show that Mr Lee Kuan Yew did be­lieve his house had been gazetted.</p>
    <p>PM Lee is su­ing Mr Xu over claims he made in a TOC ar­ti­cle pub­lished on Aug 15 last year. The al­legedly defam­a­tory state­ments in the ar­ti­cle in­clude an al­le­ga­tion that PM Lee had mis­led his fa­ther into think­ing that the 38 Oxley Road house had been gazetted by the Gov­ern­ment, and that it was there­fore fu­tile for Mr Lee Kuan Yew to keep his di­rec­tion to de­mol­ish it.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim asked Ms Kwa to con­firm if a clause re­lat­ing to the de­mo­li­tion of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s 38 Oxley Road home had been in­cluded in the first four of the six wills she pre­pared for him, but not the last two. Ms Kwa con­firmed this.</p>
    <p>The de­mo­li­tion clause was re­moved in the fifth will Ms Kwa pre­pared, dated Oct 4, 2012, and was not re­in­stated in the sixth will, dated Nov 2, 2012. How­ever, it was later in­cluded in the late Mr Lee’s fi­nal will on Dec 17, 2013.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also asked Ms Kwa to con­firm that she had writ­ten sev­eral hand­writ­ten notes on copies of var­i­ous e-mails and let­ters be­tween her and the Lee fam­ily.</p>
    <p>One such note said “Ling one share more”, re­fer­ring to Mr Lee Kuan Yew giv­ing his daugh­ter, Dr Lee Wei Ling, an ex­tra share of the es­tate com­pared with her broth­ers in ear­lier ver­sions of his will. The fi­nal will gave all three equal shares.</p>
    <p>An­other had the words “I can’t find gazette. Told him”, which Ms Kwa had writ­ten on a copy of an e-mail that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had sent to Ms Kwa and Dr Lee on Sept 6, 2012.</p>
    <p>Ms Kwa told the court that she had in­deed writ­ten the words and that the “him” in the note had re­ferred to Mr Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
    <p>She also said that she had writ­ten “I can’t find Oxley gazette” on a copy of an e-mail from the late Mr Lee to Ms Kwa, dated Oct 16, 2012.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Au­drey Lim asked Ms Kwa to con­firm that both e-mails were re­fer­ring to the re­sults of her at­tempts to find a doc­u­ment show­ing that the Oxley Road house had been gazetted.</p>
    <p>“That is cor­rect,” Ms Kwa replied.</p>
    <p>She added that she could not re­mem­ber how many times she had tried to find such a doc­u­ment, but that “it would be at least twice”.</p>
    <p>When Mr Lim asked if she had in­formed Mr Lee Kuan Yew of the out­come on each oc­ca­sion af­ter she did a search, Ms Kwa said the an­swer was priv­i­leged.</p>
    <p>She gave the same re­sponse to sev­eral other ques­tions Mr Lim asked, which were re­lated to her at­tor­ney-client re­la­tion­ship with the late Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when she said this in re­sponse to Mr Lim’s ques­tions about two notes she had writ­ten which said “Loong has free rein” and “he can han­dle Cab­i­net”, Jus­tice Lim told her to an­swer them.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it is priv­i­leged. This is what is writ­ten, so we would like a clar­i­fi­ca­tion as to who ‘he’ is,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Ms Kwa con­firmed that she was re­fer­ring to PM Lee. Mr Lim then moved on to other ques­tions and did not pur­sue th­ese points fur­ther.</p>
    <p>The par­ties were given four weeks to make writ­ten sub­mis­sions to Jus­tice Lim, who will de­liver her judg­ment at a later date.</p>
