    <p>SEOUL South Korea grap­pled with a resur­gence i n Covid-19 cases, as a se­nior of­fi­cial warned that it could be the coun­try’s largest wave of in­fec­tions if the spread is not quickly con­tained.</p>
    <p>The Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion Agency (KDCA) re­ported 386 new daily coron­avirus cases as at mid­night on Fri­day, bring­ing to­tal in­fec­tions to 30,403, with 503 deaths.</p>
    <p>New cases topped 300 for the fourth day in a row, af­ter last Tues­day saw the high­est since Au­gust.</p>
    <p>“We are at a crit­i­cal junc­ture; if we fail to block the cur­rent spread, we could be fac­ing a large na­tion­wide in­fec­tion that sur­passes” the first two waves, se­nior KDCA of­fi­cial Lim Sook-young told a news brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try was hit by a jump in cases in late Fe­bru­ary to early March, and in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The stan­dard for im­pos­ing tougher so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures was ex­pected to be reached soon, Ms Lim said.</p>
    <p>The daily na­tional tally is ex­pected to reach 400 new cases this week and more than 600 early next month if the cur­rent rate of one pa­tient in­fect­ing 1.5 peo­ple is not curbed, she added.</p>
    <p>Due to re­cent in­fec­tions spread­ing among col­lege and pri­vate af­ter-school tu­ition acad­e­mies, she es­pe­cially urged young peo­ple to re­frain from meet­ing and to get tested early.</p>
    <p>South Korea tight­ened pre­ven</p>
    <p>tion guide­lines on Thurs­day ahead of highly com­pet­i­tive an­nual col­lege en­trance ex­ams on Dec 3.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun on Fri­day called for all so­cial gath­er­ings to be can­celled, but bars, night­clubs, re­li­gious ser­vices and sports events con­tinue to be per­mit­ted with at­ten­dance re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>South Korea is ne­go­ti­at­ing to se­cure Covid-19 vac­cines for 30 mil­lion peo­ple, or about 60 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, of which vac­cines for 10 mil­lion peo­ple are ex­pected to be pro­cured through the global Covid-19 vac­cine fa­cil­ity known as Co­vax, Ms Lim said.</p>
    <p>The Seoul metropoli­tan re­gion recorded 262 new cases on Fri­day, up from 218 cases on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials have pre­vi­ously said the cap­i­tal re­gion, where about half of the coun­try’s 52 mil­lion peo­ple live and work, could be sub­jected to tougher re­stric­tions if the av­er­age daily in­fec­tion over a week rose to 200 or more.</p>
