    <p>Un­vary­ing days, the same four walls at home, the reg­u­lar Zoom meet­ings with the same peo­ple – you know, the ones who still ir­ri­tate you even when you are work­ing from home – make us all crave... a lit­tle ex­cite­ment.</p>
    <p>So we stalk In­sta­gram, wait­ing for boxes to drop.</p>
    <p>Yes, the drop­ping of boxes has be­come a thing in this pan­demic, as peo­ple find plea­sure and hap­pi­ness in boxes of pas­try.</p>
    <p>Home-based food busi­nesses have flour­ished dur­ing Covid-19 and they have built up such huge fan bases that the boxes are snatched up the minute they are up for grabs.</p>
    <p>One business, Lev­elled, which sells cane­les and jet-black brown­ies, had a wait­ing list more than 1,000 names long.</p>
    <p>Lucky cus­tomers crow on social media about their haul and post pic­tures, of course. Oth­ers gripe in the com­ments about un­suc­cess­ful at­tempts to score this box or that.</p>
    <p>For bak­ers test­ing the mar­ket, this has been an op­por­tu­nity to test what works and what does not res­onate with cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Lovers of pas­try have never had it so good. Who would not want to open a box of ex­quis­ite cakes, cup­cakes, cane­les, brown­ies, tarts and crois­sants?</p>
    <p>At least two of th­ese busi­nesses, Le Matin Patis­serie and Tigerlily Patis­serie, are open­ing bricks-and­mor­tar shops. And to think, they did it all by think­ing about what’s in­side the box.</p>
