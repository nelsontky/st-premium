    <p>•</p>
    <p>Turkey yes­ter­day ended search-and-res­cue ef­forts in the rub­ble of build­ings that col­lapsed as a re­sult of last Fri­day’s pow­er­ful earth­quake in the Aegean Sea.</p>
    <p>The death toll crept up to 116 in the western city of Izmir and a Greek is­land fol­low­ing the earth­quake that brought build­ings down and set off tidal waves which slammed into coastal ar­eas and is­lands.</p>
    <p>In Izmir, peo­ple ran onto streets in panic, wit­nesses said, after the quake struck with a mag­ni­tude of up to 7.0.</p>
    <p>The quake, the dead­li­est to hit Turkey in nearly a decade, in­jured 1,035 peo­ple in Izmir, of which 137 were still be­ing treated, Turkey’s Disas­ter and Emer­gency Man­age­ment Au­thor­ity (AFAD) said.</p>
    <p>It said search-and-res­cue ef­forts at 17 dam­aged or col­lapsed build­ings had been com­pleted and teams were clear­ing the rub­ble.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the 114 peo­ple killed in Turkey, two vic­tims of the quake were teenagers on the Greek is­land of Samos, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, 90 hours after the quake struck, res­cuers in Izmir pulled a young sur­vivor, Ayda Gez­gin, out of the rub­ble, after hear­ing the screams of the girl, who is said to be four years old.</p>
    <p>The day be­fore, another young girl, three-year-old Elif Per­incek, was res­cued from a col­lapsed build­ing. She is now re­cov­er­ing in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Her two sis­ters and a brother were res­cued along with their</p>
    <p>mother last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, one of the chil­dren sub­se­quently died.</p>
    <p>More than 2,790 tents were set up for tem­po­rary shel­ter and more than 10,222 beds were dis­trib­uted in the area, AFAD said.</p>
    <p>It added that 22 boats had sunk and 43 oth­ers had run aground, of which 40 had been res­cued, as a re­sult of the quake.</p>
    <p>Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earth­quakes.</p>
    <p>More than 500 peo­ple were killed in a 2011 quake in the east­ern city of Van, while another in Jan­uary killed 41 peo­ple in the east­ern prov­ince of Elazig.</p>
    <p>In 1999, two pow­er­ful quakes killed 18,000 peo­ple in north-western Turkey.</p>
    <p>AFAD said last Fri­day’s earth­quake had a mag­ni­tude of 6.6, with 1,855 af­ter­shocks.</p>
    <p>The United States Ge­o­log­i­cal Sur­vey put the mag­ni­tude at 7.0, and the Kandilli Ob­ser­va­tory in Is­tan­bul said it was 6.9.</p>
