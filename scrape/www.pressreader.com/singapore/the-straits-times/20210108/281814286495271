    <p>BEI­JING • One of China’s top sci­en­tists de­fended the coun­try’s de­lay in rais­ing a global alarm in the early days of the coron­avirus out­break, say­ing of­fi­cials were ini­tially un­sure whether the pathogen was in­fec­tious among hu­mans be­cause close con­tacts of the first pa­tients did not ap­pear to fall sick.</p>
    <p>In the first few days of last year, af­ter the mys­te­ri­ous pneu­mo­nia clus­ter emerged in the city of Wuhan, Chi­nese ex­perts quar­an­tined 700 close con­tacts of the first pa­tients – in­clud­ing 400 med­i­cal work­ers who tended to them – but none showed signs of ill­ness.</p>
    <p>This led ex­perts to hold off on con­clud­ing the coron­avirus was trans­mis­si­ble among hu­mans, said Dr Liang Wan­nian, a se­nior of­fi­cial at the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion who over­saw China’s virus re­sponse un­til Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“At the be­gin­ning of Jan­uary, none of the two dozen cases – and later in­creased to four dozens – fit those cri­te­ria,” said Dr Liang in an in­ter­view on Tues­day in Bei­jing. “Our call at the time was that there was no clear ev­i­dence for hu­manto-hu­man trans­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>It was not un­til Jan 20 that China con­firmed the virus can be passed on among hu­mans, af­ter some of the med­i­cal staff be­came in­fected.</p>
    <p>By then, the sit­u­a­tion had spi­ralled out of con­trol: Days later, Wuhan and the broader Hubei prov­ince were forced into a dra­co­nian lock­down as cases surged and hos­pi­tals were over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>China has faced heavy crit­i­cism for those lost days.</p>
    <p>The initial down­play­ing of the sever­ity of the pathogen’s threat al­lowed Covid-19 to rapidly leap across bor­ders to be­come a pan­demic that has since in­fected more than 86 mil­lion peo­ple and killed over 1.8 mil­lion glob­ally.</p>
    <p>It is now un­der­stood that many Covid-19 pa­tients are asymp­to­matic, which may have ac­counted for why quar­an­tined close con­tacts of those first pa­tients did not seem to fall ill.</p>
    <p>Dr Liang’s com­ments are the most de­tailed public state­ments yet from top Chi­nese of­fi­cials at the time de­scrib­ing cir­cum­stances at the start of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Some gov­ern­ments, how­ever, acted much faster than China. Tai­wan dodged a ma­jor out­break by im­pos­ing bor­der con­trols and other strict curbs in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese health of­fi­cials vis­ited Wuhan early on and no­ticed that some among the first pa­tients had no links to the wet mar­ket sus­pected as the place where peo­ple were get­ting in­fected. This led them to con­clude hu­man-to-hu­man trans­mis­sion was oc­cur­ring.</p>
    <p>Faced with global ac­ri­mony, China has sought to shift the nar­ra­tive over the virus’ ori­gins, with state me­dia and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials push­ing the pos­si­bil­ity that the pathogen did not emerge solely in the Asian coun­try.</p>
    <p>Dr Liang, a public health veteran who also over­saw Bei­jing’s re­sponse to the Sars out­break in 2003, echoed the the­ory.</p>
    <p>He said that while much spec­u­la­tion fo­cused on wild an­i­mals at the mar­ket serv­ing as an in­ter­me­di­ary host to the virus that was then passed on to hu­mans, most of the ear­li­est pa­tients were mer­chants sell­ing seafood there.</p>
    <p>The lack of any de­fin­i­tive so­lu­tions to the mys­tery has fed into the po­lit­i­cal di­vi­sions cre­ated by the pan­demic, par­tic­u­larly between China and the United States.</p>
    <p>China’s ac­tions have not helped dis­pel the mis­trust. Rep­re­sen­ta­tives and sci­en­tists from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) vis­ited Wuhan last Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary, but were barred from en­ter­ing the mar­ket to con­duct in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Aus­tralia’s For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne said that China should give ac­cess to WHO of­fi­cials in­ves­ti­gat­ing the ori­gins of Covid-19 “without de­lay”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, the head of the WHO said he was “very dis­ap­pointed” that China had still not au­tho­rised the en­try of a team of in­ter­na­tional coron­avirus ex­perts.</p>
    <p>“We hope the nec­es­sary per­mis­sions for the WHO team’s travel to China can be is­sued without de­lay,” Ms Payne said.</p>
