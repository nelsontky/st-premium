    <p>The United States has yet to pass a new round of fis­cal stim­u­lus, but the hope for gov­ern­ment aid has al­ready stim­u­lated key stock mar­kets across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Op­ti­mism among lo­cal in­vestors helped push the Straits Times In­dex (STI) up 4.75 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 2,543.11 yes­ter­day – barely changed from the 0.2 per cent gain at the open­ing bell.</p>
    <p>Gain­ers beat losers 222 to 156, with 975 mil­lion shares worth $804.6 mil­lion traded.</p>
    <p>Thai Bev­er­age was the STI’s best per­former and the most ac­tive. The counter gained 1.71 per cent to 59.5 cents on a trad­ing vol­ume of 24.29 mil­lion. The counter was also the most heav­ily traded stock on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>At the bot­tom of the per­for­mance ta­ble were two Jar­dine com­pa­nies: Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings lost 1.18 per cent to close at US$43.52, and Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional dropped 0.76 per cent to US$3.94.</p>
    <p>Most Asian mar­kets were buoyed by the overnight Wall Street rally af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s call for Covid-19 re­lief mea­sures.</p>
    <p>IG mar­ket an­a­lyst Pan Jingyi said: “Fresh op­ti­mism on the US fis­cal stim­u­lus front re­turned to carry mar­kets higher – never mind that the po­ten­tial tranche of fis­cal sup­port, in­clud­ing aid for air­lines and other tar­geted sup­port mea­sures, would be a frac­tion of the wider pack­age.</p>
    <p>“Along­side the ac­com­moda­tive tone held in the Septem­ber (Fed­eral Open Mar­ket Com­mit­tee) minutes, this al­to­gether pro­vided crutches for the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Malaysian shares led the re­gional rally with a 2.01 per cent gain, while Aus­tralia’s ASX 200 closed up 1.09 per cent and the Nikkei 225 In­dex added 0.96 per cent to ap­proach lev­els reached in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi ad­vanced 0.21 per cent to clock a rally for the sev­enth straight ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was one of the rare few left out of the party. It slid 0.2 per cent while main­land China ended its Golden Week hol­i­day yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Brexit talks con­tinue to play on nerves. Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel said the bloc was keen on a deal “but not at any cost”, while Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son reaf­firmed London’s de­sire for an agree­ment but said it was pre­pared to walk away if none was reached by next Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Fears that the two will not reach a deal by next week’s sum­mit are weigh­ing on the pound and wor­ry­ing mar­kets, with many ob­servers warn­ing it would be eco­nom­i­cally dev­as­tat­ing for Bri­tain as it tries to re­cover from the virus’ im­pact.</p>
