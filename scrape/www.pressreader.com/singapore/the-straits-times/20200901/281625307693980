    <p>In need of cash, an avid gam­bler con­vinced her friend to with­draw his en­tire Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund sav­ings of more than $53,000 in 1999 and hand over at least $500 of his salary ev­ery month from 2000 to 2013. Tan Hwee Ngo, now 71, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to two years and three months in jail af­ter she was found guilty of 169 cheat­ing charges in July.</p>
    <p>In need of cash, an avid gam­bler con­vinced her friend to with­draw his en­tire Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sav­ings of more than $53,000 in 1999 and hand over at least $500 of his salary ev­ery month from 2000 to 2013.</p>
    <p>Dish­washer Tan Hwee Ngo, now 71, claimed that the money was for Sin­ga­pore’s late found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
    <p>Petrol pump at­ten­dant Tan Soy Kiang, who has mild in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity, be­lieved her lies and did as he was told even though he earned only be­tween $700 and $1,300 a month.</p>
    <p>The court ear­lier heard that the ac­cused had cheated Mr Tan, now 76, of at least $130,000 in to­tal.</p>
    <p>The con­woman was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to two years and three months’ jail af­ter District Judge Ter­ence Tay found her guilty of 169 cheat­ing charges in July.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Mr Tan started work­ing as a petrol pump at­ten­dant in 1992.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan and Tan had a com­mon friend, for­mer cleaner Boo Sok Hiang, 71, also known as Ah Hiang.</p>
    <p>In her sub­mis­sions, Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Thiam Jia Min said that Mr Tan and Madam Boo had been friends for nearly 30 years af­ter they met while watch­ing Teochew op­eras. She in­tro­duced him to Tan around May 1999, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Tan later claimed that she needed money for Mr Lee. On May 11 that year, Mr Tan vis­ited a CPF ser­vice cen­tre and filled up an ap­pli­ca­tion form to with­draw his en­tire CPF sav­ings in the Or­di­nary Ac­count.</p>
    <p>More than $53,000 was then cred­ited into his bank ac­count the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>The DPP added: “Mr Tan sought Ah Hiang’s as­sis­tance to with­draw the CPF monies from his... bank ac­count and pass them to the ac­cused. Con­se­quently, Mr Tan en­trusted Ah Hiang with his ATM card and per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber to make the with­drawals.</p>
    <p>“Mr Tan had en­listed Ah Hiang’s help as he was busy with work and had no time to make the with­drawals.”</p>
    <p>Madam Boo then told Mr Tan that she had with­drawn the money and passed it to Tan. By us­ing sim­i­lar lies, Tan also man­aged to con­vince Mr Tan to hand over at least $500 of his salary ev­ery month.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan passed the money to Madam Boo who would then hand a “sub­stan­tial por­tion” to Tan.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Mr Tan moved in with his niece, Madam Pamela Lim, and her hus­band. The cou­ple then no­ticed that Mr Tan would bor­row money from them and Madam Lim’s mother al­most ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>This struck them as pe­cu­liar since he earned money from his job and did not ap­pear to have any ex­penses to foot.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim also found out from her mother that her un­cle had with­drawn all his CPF monies when he turned 55 and the en­tire sum was gone. Madam Lim and her hus­band then checked with Mr Tan, the court heard.</p>
    <p>“Mr Tan ex­plained that the ac­cused and Ah Hiang told him some­thing about a failed busi­ness in­vest­ment in­volv­ing Yeo Hiap Seng, which was taken over by the Govern­ment, such that he now needed to make re­pay­ments to ‘Lao Lee’,” the DPP said, in a ref­er­ence to Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim then lodged a po­lice re­port on Feb 3, 2014.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, Tan tried to shift the blame to Madam Boo, who had died of heart disease on April 21, 2016, be­fore the trial started. But the DPP noted that in an ear­lier po­lice state­ment, Tan ad­mit­ted that she had cheated Mr Tan. She also ad­mit­ted in the state­ment that she needed the money to gam­ble.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court heard that Tan will be ap­peal­ing against her con­vic­tion and sen­tence. Her bail has been set at $20,000.</p>
