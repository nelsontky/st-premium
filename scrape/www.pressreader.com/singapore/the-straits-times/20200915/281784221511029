    <p>A sec­ond wave of virus in­fec­tion could be break­ing over Europe and the sit­u­a­tion could turn grim in the com­ing months, as the north­ern hemi­sphere ap­proaches the win­ter months.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in Britain, more than 3,000 new cases were re­ported in 24 hours for the sec­ond day in a row last Satur­day. France also chalked up 10,000 new in­fec­tions on Satur­day, close to the peak of its first wave in April.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries fac­ing a resur­gence in­clude Spain, which be­came the first Western Euro­pean na­tion to record more than 500,000 cases since the start of the out­break.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts in Sin­ga­pore cau­tioned that this could be a wor­ry­ing up­trend.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Paul Tam­byah, pres­i­dent of the Asia Pa­cific So­ci­ety of Clin­i­cal Mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy and In­fec­tion, said that though it is un­clear if the in­creased num­bers are due to more testing or more cases, it is likely the num­ber of cases will go up with the colder months.</p>
    <p>Res­pi­ra­tory viruses thrive in the win­ter as, among other rea­sons, peo­ple are more likely to gather in crowded in­door en­vi­ron­ments, fa­cil­i­tat­ing trans­mis­sion, Prof Tam­byah told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said sea­sonal in­fluenza is of­ten more preva­lent in the win­ter months, and if Covid-19 and the flu co-cir­cu­late, it would place ad­di­tional stress on al­ready bur­dened health­care sys­tems.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Prof Cook re­mained cau­tiously op­ti­mistic that the mea­sures used to pre­vent Covid-19 would also pro­tect against other res­pi­ra­tory viruses.</p>
    <p>“Ev­i­dence is also emerg­ing from the south­ern hemi­sphere – which has al­ready ex­pe­ri­enced their first win­ter of in­fluenza and Covid-19 si­mul­ta­ne­ously – that their in­fluenza epi­demics this win­ter were much smaller than usual be­cause of the Covid-19 safety mea­sures. So, if safe dis­tanc­ing can be kept up, it might pre­vent this dou­ble epi­demic.”</p>
    <p>In­fluenza vac­ci­na­tion cov­er­age rates might also in­crease as peo­ple are more aware of the need to pro­tect them­selves, Prof Cook said. “It’s re­ally im­por­tant for those at higher risk of flu to get a vac­cine shot this year, es­pe­cially el­ders.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS’ Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said, how­ever, that with the symp­toms of Covid-19 and in­fluenza be­ing sim­i­lar, peo­ple may be con­fused as to whether they have the flu or Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The usual pro­cesses of con­tact trac­ing and quar­an­tine might be con­founded if peo­ple think they sim­ply have the flu and do not come for­ward early enough, when they in fact have Covid-19, Prof Teo said. “This be­hav­iour can cer­tainly and un­wit­tingly seed ad­di­tional com­mu­nity clus­ters.”</p>
    <p>But Europe’s fate would re­ally de­pend on whether gov­ern­ments and the peo­ple make the com­mit­ment to con­trol the sit­u­a­tion, mon­i­tor and en­force mea­sures so as to drive down com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions, he said, not­ing: “I do not be­lieve that Covid-19 will nec­es­sar­ily take off dur­ing win­ter months, since we saw how China and South Korea were able to suc­cess­fully con­trol large-scale com­mu­nity spread even dur­ing their win­ter months of Fe­bru­ary and March.”</p>
    <p>“How­ever, stamp­ing out new Covid-19 cases would re­quire mea­sures to curb in­ter­ac­tions be­tween peo­ple, which re­gret­tably ap­pears to be lack­ing presently in many Euro­pean coun­tries,” he said. Coun­tries that fail to do so might see larger out­breaks this time, he cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior con­sul­tant in the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, added that it would be use­ful for coun­tries ap­proach­ing win­ter to have strate­gic plans to en­gage the com­mu­nity in how they should ap­proach and mod­ify be­hav­iour in the colder months.</p>
    <p>A wors­en­ing of the Europe sit­u­a­tion bodes ill for Sin­ga­pore as well in var­i­ous as­pects, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>It is un­likely that the Gov­ern­ment will al­low travel to coun­tries with un­con­trolled com­mu­nity spread, Prof Fisher said.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said this would open the door to more im­ported cases, and run the risk of wors­en­ing the frag­ile lo­cal sit­u­a­tion es­pe­cially when Sin­ga­pore’s current Covid-19 out­look is op­ti­mistic and pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“Even if there are green lane ar­range­ments es­tab­lished for busi­ness and essen­tial travel, we will need to con­tinue our quar­an­tine mea­sures for any in­com­ing trav­ellers from these coun­tries, in des­ig­nated gov­ern­ment fa­cil­i­ties rather than home quar­an­tine.”</p>
    <p>A resur­gence of cases could also threaten global food se­cu­rity and med­i­cal sup­ply chains, he warned.</p>
    <p>Prof Tam­byah said good data will be crit­i­cal as well as the rolling out of novel di­ag­nos­tics, treat­ments and vac­cines to in­di­cate the level of im­mu­nity needed to pro­tect a com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Coun­tries may be forced to in­no­vate and con­sider mea­sures such as ‘im­mu­nity pass­ports’ or less than per­fect rapid di­ag­nos­tic tests at en­try points as a pro­longed ban on travel is not likely to be sus­tained for­ever,” he noted.</p>
