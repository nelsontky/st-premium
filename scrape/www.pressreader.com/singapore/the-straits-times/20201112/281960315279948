    <p>All the things that al­lowed China’s In­ter­net in­no­va­tors to be­come big, pow­er­ful and hugely prof­itable are un­der threat. The im­pli­ca­tions are chill­ing for es­tab­lished play­ers.</p>
    <p>Draft rules de­tailed by China’s an­titrust watch­dog on Tues­day are aimed at root­ing out mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices among In­ter­net com­pa­nies. It is seek­ing feed­back on a raft of reg­u­la­tions that would curb anti-com­pet­i­tive be­hav­iour such as col­lud­ing on shar­ing sen­si­tive con­sumer data, al­liances that squeeze out smaller ri­vals and sub­si­dis­ing ser­vices at be­low cost to elim­i­nate com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tors’ move could be in­vig­o­rat­ing for po­ten­tial chal­lengers to in­dus­try lead­ers such as Alibaba Group Hold­ing, Ten­cent Hold­ings, Meituan and Baidu.</p>
    <p>Take Alibaba. The Hangzhou-based com­pany has a side gig sell­ing cloud com­put­ing ser­vices, which has posted chronic op­er­at­ing losses as the firm chases cus­tomers and mar­ket share.</p>
    <p>The huge prof­its of Alibaba’s legacy e-com­merce busi­ness have helped to buf­fer th­ese losses, which widened 23 per cent last year to US$1 bil­lion (S$1.35 bil­lion). The new rules could con­ceiv­ably put an end to that kind of sub­sidi­s­a­tion, forc­ing the com­pany to raise prices and churn a profit, or even di­vest the busi­ness al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery and book­ing ser­vice gi­ant Meituan could also be in reg­u­la­tors’ sights.</p>
    <p>Within a year of its Hong Kong list­ing, the com­pany man­aged to turn prof­itable thanks to its deep knowl­edge of con­sumer habits, which it could then lever­age to sell ad­ver­tise­ments to vendors who use its plat­form. That, too, could be in jeop­ardy un­der the an­titrust rules, which would restrict the use of such data to tar­get spe­cific cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Games and so­cial net­work­ing com­pany Ten­cent, e-re­tailer JD.com and search provider Baidu may also face scru­tiny, given their size and dom­i­nance in their re­spec­tive niches.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing may also re­quire firms that op­er­ate a so-called vari­able in­ter­est en­tity (VIE) – a ve­hi­cle through which vir­tu­ally ev­ery ma­jor Chi­nese In­ter­net com­pany at­tracts for­eign in­vest­ment and lists over­seas – to ap­ply for spe­cific op­er­at­ing ap­proval.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tors’ goal may be to clear the decks for fresh com­pa­nies to en­ter. A chal­lenger in the cloud busi­ness would strug­gle to com­pete if Alibaba, with US$60 bil­lion in cash and equiv­a­lents, can just keep un­der­cut­ting it un­til the new en­trant runs out of money.</p>
    <p>In a mar­ket with­out com­pe­ti­tion rules, preda­tory pric­ing is just reg­u­lar busi­ness.</p>
    <p>With data be­ing al­most as valu­able as cash, com­pa­nies like Meituan and Ten­cent have a dis­tinct ad­van­tage be­cause they know more about the mar­ket and con­sumers than any new­bie that wants to hang out its shin­gle and start of­fer­ing ser­vices. Throt­tling that data flow could help even the play­ing field.</p>
    <p>It’s pos­si­ble this in­ter­ven­tion will add fresh en­ergy to an In­ter­net mar­ket that has passed its growth hey­day, ex­ac­er­bated by a slow­ing of the Chi­nese do­mes­tic con­sumer sec­tor and the pan­demic-hit global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>TIGHTER GRIP ON MONEY FLOWS</p>
    <p>It may also let Bei­jing shep­herd in a new crop of com­pa­nies that bet­ter align with its eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal goals, which in­clude tighter con­trol over in­for­ma­tion and money flows.</p>
    <p>The nix­ing last week of Ant Group’s much-an­tic­i­pated list­ing is ev­i­dence that not even the world’s big­gest ini­tial public of­fer­ing is im­mune to reg­u­la­tory change. In Ant’s case, the con­cern was over the fin­tech gi­ant’s risk man­age­ment and mar­ket dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>Hints as to Bei­jing’s goal can be seen in plans to re­quire VIEs to get op­er­at­ing ap­proval. For over a decade, VIEs have ex­isted in a le­gal grey area that lets Chi­nese com­pa­nies skirt re­stric­tions on for­eign own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>A clam­p­down may ac­cel­er­ate moves to delist from US mar­kets and re­turn home, a trend spurred by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ag­gres­sive poli­cies to­wards China. Do­ing so would al­low reg­u­la­tors to keep a tighter grip on the money flow­ing in and out of th­ese gi­ants, and re­di­rect funds to projects that bet­ter align with Bei­jing’s China-first pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tion may well achieve the goal of lim­it­ing mo­nop­o­lies and open­ing up the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But com­pa­nies are quick to adapt, with ev­ery chance that new be­he­moths will ap­pear.</p>
    <p>Wit­ness the con­sid­er­able ef­forts to crack down on Mi­crosoft in the late 1990s, aimed at sep­a­rat­ing its In­ter­net browser from its op­er­at­ing sys­tem. In the sub­se­quent decade, Al­pha­bet’s Google and Face­book rose to dom­i­nate new do­mains.</p>
    <p>The world is now en­gaged in ef­forts to limit the mar­ket power of the new ti­tans. Mean­while, Mi­crosoft still holds a com­mand­ing share of the op­er­at­ing sys­tem mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing may be suc­cess­ful in stymieing China’s cur­rent</p>
    <p>Big Tech co­hort. Just don’t ex­pect the era of In­ter­net leviathans to end.</p>
