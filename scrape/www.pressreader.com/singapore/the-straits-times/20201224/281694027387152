    <p>JERUSALEM • Is­rael’s gov­ern­ment has col­lapsed, push­ing the coun­try into yet an­other early elec­tion – the fourth in two years.</p>
    <p>The Is­raeli Par­lia­ment dis­solved it­self at mid­night on Tues­day, forc­ing a new elec­tion af­ter weeks of infighting in the so-called unity gov­ern­ment, an un­easy coali­tion sworn in just seven months ago that paired Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu’s con­ser­va­tive Likud party with his main ri­val-turned-part­ner, Mr Benny Gantz of the cen­trist Blue and White party.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu and Mr Gantz blamed each other for the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We should have united forces to find a way to avert these need­less elec­tions,” Mr Ne­tanyahu said in Par­lia­ment as he tried, and failed, to de­lay its dis­so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>A new elec­tion is sched­uled for March 23.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment au­to­mat­i­cally dis­persed af­ter fail­ing to meet the le­gal dead­line to ap­prove a budget for 2020. Mr Ne­tanyahu, whose party holds the fi­nance port­fo­lio, had re­fused to present a budget, vi­o­lat­ing his coali­tion agree­ment with Mr Gantz – the os­ten­si­ble rea­son for the gov­ern­ment break­down.</p>
    <p>But at the heart of the cri­sis lies a deep, mu­tual dis­trust between the two men and a coun­try fun­da­men­tally split over the fate of Mr Ne­tanyahu, whose cor­rup­tion trial will move into an in­ten­sive stage early next year, re­quir­ing his reg­u­lar pres­ence in court.</p>
    <p>He has been charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He denies any wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say Mr Ne­tanyahu is gam­bling on an­other elec­tion, hop­ing to form a right-wing, re­li­gious gov­ern­ment that will grant him im­mu­nity from pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Reu­ven Hazan, a pro­fes­sor of po­lit­i­cal science at the He­brew Univer­sity of Jerusalem, said Mr Ne­tanyahu “needs a gov­ern­ment that will pass leg­is­la­tion ei­ther to de­lay his case for the fore­see­able fu­ture or can­cel it al­to­gether”.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion pro­vides him with an es­cape hatch from the coali­tion agree­ment stip­u­lat­ing that Mr Gantz take over as prime min­is­ter 11 months from now.</p>
    <p>From the in­cep­tion of the unity gov­ern­ment, few peo­ple, in­clud­ing Mr Gantz, ex­pected Mr Ne­tanyahu to hon­our that agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Gantz’s party re­fused to back any com­pro­mise with Mr Ne­tanyahu over the au­thor­ity for mak­ing key ap­point­ments. A com­pro­mise would have vi­o­lated the party’s flag­ship pol­icy of up­hold­ing the rule of law but would have kept the gov­ern­ment on life sup­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu, Is­rael’s longest­serv­ing prime min­is­ter renowned for his po­lit­i­cal savvy, quickly piv­oted into cam­paign mode.</p>
    <p>“The ma­jor­ity of the citizens of Is­rael see our lead­er­ship and our tremen­dous achieve­ments,” he said in a tele­vised ad­dress on Tues­day evening. “We are bring­ing in mil­lions of vac­ci­na­tions, de­liv­er­ing his­toric peace agree­ments, curb­ing the Ira­nian threat and turn­ing Is­rael into one of the world’s lead­ing economies.”</p>
    <p>Mr Gantz said his party had en­tered Mr Ne­tanyahu’s gov­ern­ment de­spite pay­ing a high po­lit­i­cal price, “to serve the best in­ter­ests of the coun­try, given the needs and scale of the mo­ment”.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately,” he said, “we found no part­ner on the other end.”</p>
