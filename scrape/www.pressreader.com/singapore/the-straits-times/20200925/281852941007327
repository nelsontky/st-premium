    <p>Former Malaysian premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad said a vote of no con­fi­dence should be held in Par­lia­ment to de­ter­mine if Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin still has the ma­jor­ity sup­port to lead the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Tun Dr Ma­hathir said yes­ter­day that with Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi af­firm­ing that “many” Umno MPs now sup­port op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim, Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity would have been erased.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment should also vote to de­cide who has ma­jor­ity sup­port as prime min­is­ter, he said, rather than call­ing for a fresh gen­eral elec­tion amid the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>
    <p>“Since Tan Sri Muhyid­din was sworn in as prime min­is­ter, I have asked for a vote of no con­fi­dence to be held in Par­lia­ment to solve this prob­lem,” Dr Ma­hathir said in a state­ment, re­fer­ring to ques­tions over Mr Muhyid­din’s ma­jor­ity when he be­came premier in March.</p>
    <p>“If this can be done, then we can avoid hav­ing a gen­eral elec­tion at a time when we are still bat­tling the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir said this fol­low­ing Datuk Seri An­war’s claim on Wed­nes­day that he had a “con­vinc­ing and for­mi­da­ble” ma­jor­ity to form a gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­til Mr An­war’s claim, Mr Muhyid­din was said to have 113 MPs back­ing him, with 109 sup­port­ing the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ah­mad Zahid, re­spond­ing on Wed­nes­day to Mr An­war’s claims, said he was aware that “many” MPs from Umno and the Barisan Na­sional (BN) coali­tion now backed the op­po­si­tion chief.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Ma­hathir: “If we ac­cept that Zahid’s state­ment is true and is based on his po­si­tion as Umno and BN chief, this means Muhyid­din can no longer stress he has a solid ma­jor­ity to be the PM. The im­por­tant thing now is to study whether the PM still has the ma­jor­ity to re­main in his po­si­tion. Whether An­war has a ma­jor­ity or not is a sep­a­rate is­sue that he (An­war) will need to prove.”</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal buzz yes­ter­day was that some 15 Umno law­mak­ers who sup­ported Mr Muhyid­din are now with Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>As Mr An­war did not re­veal their names, politi­cians joined other Malaysians yes­ter­day in guess­ing who these party hop­pers could be.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, re­mained in hos­pi­tal for a third day yes­ter­day with an un­spec­i­fied ail­ment, thwart­ing Mr An­war’s plan to see him and present his list of sup­port­ing MPs.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din on Wed­nes­day is­sued a state­ment to say he re­mains the prime min­is­ter un­til Mr An­war proves through con­sti­tu­tional pro­cesses that he has ma­jor­ity sup­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din flew back to Sabah on Wed­nes­day to re­sume cam­paign­ing for tomorrow’s state polls.</p>
    <p>The claim by Mr An­war, though, has re­ver­ber­ated in his own Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion of three par­ties. Some of PH’s mem­bers have fought against Umno for decades.</p>
    <p>Though Mr Zahid has opened the door for Umno MPs to sup­port Mr An­war, PH’s Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) has in­di­cated it may not be keen to par­tic­i­pate in such an ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>DAP sec­re­tary-gen­eral Lim Guan Eng said he had been un­der the im­pres­sion that law­mak­ers from Gabun­gan Party Sarawak (GPS) – in­stead of Umno – would join the pro­posed new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>He said Mr An­war in­formed him about the plan only mo­ments be­fore the bomb­shell an­nounce­ment. “He gave the im­pres­sion that he had GPS sup­port­ing him to have a com­fort­able ma­jor­ity,” Mr Lim was quoted as say­ing by the Malaysi­akini news site.</p>
