    <p>Ex­perts at a Straits Times we­bi­nar on dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and cy­ber se­cu­rity on Wed­nes­day tack­led ques­tions from a live au­di­ence on top­ics rang­ing from whether a sep­a­rate smart­phone is needed solely for bank­ing and e-pay­ments, to the safety of the now-ubiq­ui­tous QR codes.</p>
    <p>Here are some edited ex­cerpts of the answers given by the pan­el­lists – As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Steven Wong from the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy; Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive David Koh; As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chang Ee-Chien from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s School of Com­put­ing; and Mr Ben­jamin Ang, head of the Cy­ber and Home­land De­fence Pro­gramme at pol­icy re­search think-tank Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence for Na­tional Se­cu­rity – and moder­a­tor Irene Tham, The</p>
    <p>Straits Times’ tech edi­tor.</p>
    <p>Q On the topic of hard­ware se­gre­ga­tion to min­imise com­pro­mises, cy­ber at­tacks and breaches, would it be best to have a smart­phone solely for bank­ing and e-pay­ments?</p>
    <p>Prof Chang:</p>
    <p>If it’s very im­por­tant to you, and you carry out a high vol­ume of trans­ac­tions, then you may want to think about that. I don’t have a sep­a­rate one. I do ev­ery­thing on this one smart­phone.</p>
    <p>Ms Tham: I would rec­om­mend this: Do it on sep­a­rate de­vices and on sep­a­rate net­works. I trans­act on my com­puter and re­ceive my one­time pass­words on my mo­bile phone, so I achieve both net­work and de­vice se­gre­ga­tion at the same time. I think it’s quite safe that way.</p>
    <p>Q I’ve seen many vir­tual pri­vate net­works (VPNs) be­ing ad­ver­tised on YouTube and else­where lately. Do they re­ally help in terms of cy­ber se­cu­rity at home?</p>
    <p>Prof Wong: If it’s free in real life, you wouldn’t be­lieve it. In the dig­i­tal world, don’t be­lieve it as well.</p>
    <p>Prof Chang: If some­one of­fers VPN ser­vices, he is say­ing, let me han­dle all your com­mu­ni­ca­tions. What­ever you say goes to me first, then I re­lay it to other peo­ple.</p>
    <p>This is what we call a man in the mid­dle. Very of­ten, we use VPNs to pro­tect our­selves, our iden­tity. We don’t want to let the re­ceiver end know where this is com­ing from.</p>
    <p>I know peo­ple are us­ing this to watch movies... It doesn’t ac­tu­ally make you safer, in that sense. And it’s the same thing for paid VPN ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Q Nowa­days, there are nu­mer­ous QR codes for var­i­ous things. How safe is it to scan QR codes with your mo­bile phone cam­era?</p>
    <p>Prof Chang: A QR code is just a means for some­one to send a piece of in­for­ma­tion to your phone. Prac­tise typ­i­cal com­mon sense: If some­one wants to tell you some­thing, do you want to ac­cept that?</p>
    <p>Very typ­i­cally, that piece of in­for­ma­tion is a URL, or one that says to pay us­ing PayNow.</p>
    <p>There are many in­ci­dents where hack­ers have pasted their own QR codes over the real ones, so the cus­tomer pays the hacker in­stead.</p>
    <p>Q What are the dan­gers of stream­ing free movies and TV shows on­line?</p>
    <p>Mr Ang: A l ot of peo­ple have bought these An­droid set-top boxes which prom­ise them un­lim­ited free movies. If some­thing looks too good to be true, it is.</p>
    <p>If you have taken all the care to have VPNs and se­cured ev­ery­thing in the house, but you in­tro­duce a virus-catch­ing ma­chine into your home net­work, what’s the point?</p>
    <p>Mr Koh: You have to ex­er­cise some due care and con­cern. When you in­tro­duce these set-top boxes or you want to ac­cess free movies, you have to ask your­self... what else are you al­low­ing into your home net­work? You’re tak­ing on some risks.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy al­lows us to do many things, but we need to ex­er­cise some judg­ment with our own sense of what is ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
    <p>Q I find it dif­fi­cult to keep up with fast-paced tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances de­spite at­tend­ing cour­ses and read­ing ar­ti­cles. It is also ex­pen­sive to main­tain up-to-date com­puter sys­tems. How can se­niors solve these prob­lems?</p>
    <p>Prof Wong: If you iden­tify what is im­por­tant to you, you don’t need to pro­tect ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>Do we need to al­ways go for the lat­est soft­ware? You do need to patch it, but it doesn’t mean you need the lat­est ver­sion.</p>
    <p>Patch­ing is usu­ally free, and it doesn’t mean that be­cause it’s free, it’s not use­ful. It is very use­ful. So ac­tu­ally, it may not be very ex­pen­sive to keep your de­vices safe.</p>
    <p>Just take sim­ple steps. Iden­tify what is im­por­tant to you... It can be as sim­ple as pho­tos. If you keep them in a hard disk, you can then not pro­tect it as much as a lap­top.</p>
    <p>This is some­thing you can do to try to mit­i­gate your risk in an af­ford­able way.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh: On a prac­ti­cal ba­sis, you don’t have to be pro­tected to the high­est pos­si­ble level of cy­ber se­cu­rity if you are not in­volved in very high-level trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The IT world is mov­ing at a very fast rate. Even those of us who are in the busi­ness find it very dif­fi­cult to keep pace. But you don’t need to keep pace with ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>It’s not about buy­ing the lat­est tech­nol­ogy. I don’t buy the lat­est soft­ware, I don’t buy the lat­est com­puter, but I make sure that those I have are up­dated.</p>
