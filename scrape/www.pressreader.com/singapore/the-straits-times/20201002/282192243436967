    <p>FRIENDLY RE­MINDER ON FLAG DIS­PLAY A re­minder of the du­ra­tion one is legally al­lowed to dis­play a na­tional flag would be help­ful to avoid the penalty of a fine of up to $1,000 (Re­mem­ber: Put away na­tional flag by Sept 30; Sept 28).</p>
    <p>Such a re­minder could be in­cluded in the pack­ag­ing when new flags are given out to res­i­dents. Also, a kinder ap­proach to coax and re­mind them will go down bet­ter with folk who are en­thu­si­as­tic about be­ing Sin­ga­porean.</p>

    <p>RE­DUCE SIN­GLE-USE PLAS­TIC BOT­TLES</p>
    <p>Tai­wan pro­vides free fil­tered wa­ter through dis­pensers in­stalled in pub­lic places such as shop­ping cen­tres, at­trac­tions and parks. Such fa­cil­i­ties en­cour­age the pub­lic to use re­us­able bot­tles rather than buy­ing bot­tled wa­ter from con­ve­nience stores. This would help re­duce the con­sump­tion of sin­gle-use plas­tic bot­tles in Sin­ga­pore and would be good for the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>

    <p>MISS­ING THE SHADE FROM TREES</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board fol­lows “in­ter­na­tional guide­lines” for its tree man­age­ment reg­i­men (NParks’ strict reg­i­men to care for trees; Sept 28). Upon ca­sual ob­ser­va­tion, it would seem like Sin­ga­pore’s tree prun­ing re­sem­bles that of coun­tries that ex­pe­ri­ence win­ter. It never used to be that way; our trees used to look like trees, not lamp posts. And when they were al­lowed to form a beau­ti­ful canopy, they shaded the roads from the sun all day and re­duced ra­di­ated heat from the roads. All these ben­e­fits are now lost.</p>

    <p>GIVE NEW LIFE TO SEN­TOSA MERLION</p>
    <p>I am sad to hear that the beloved Sen­tosa Merlion is planned for de­mo­li­tion soon. I won­der if it’s pos­si­ble to pre­serve the head por­tion and some­how re­in­stall it in a lo­ca­tion like Wood­lands Wa­ter­front Park fac­ing the Jo­hor Strait. It will con­tinue to be a great at­trac­tion.</p>

    <p>GET TO ROOT OF SMOK­ING PROB­LEM</p>
    <p>Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng is rais­ing the is­sue of sec­ond-hand smoke in Par­lia­ment. Why not speak up on smok­ing in the first place? With all the known ills, why not clamp down even harder or ban smok­ing al­to­gether, like what the Govern­ment did with per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vices. The high num­ber of smok­ers, de­spite all the ed­u­ca­tion and ex­ist­ing mea­sures, is in­dica­tive of the need for more ac­tion. Get to the root cause, there is no use just danc­ing around the con­se­quences.</p>
