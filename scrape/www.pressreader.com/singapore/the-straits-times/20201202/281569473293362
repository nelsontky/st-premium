    <p>Many peo­ple have re­duced their daily phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties due to re­stric­tions brought about by the pan­demic. But doc­tors warn that un­der­us­ing one’s mus­cles may have se­ri­ous con­se­quences, such as the loss of mus­cle mass and func­tion. Ex­perts share ways to pre­vent such out­comes.</p>
    <p>At the start of the year, Mr Lim H.L. wrote down one goal – to lose at least 5kg this year.</p>
    <p>Then Covid-19 struck and gyms were shut dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April to June.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old ac­count ex­ec­u­tive “lost all mo­ti­va­tion” to get ac­tive. Lack­ing the dis­ci­pline to join an on­line work­out class, he “moved around min­i­mally” and spent much of his free time binge­watch­ing Net­flix shows.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing was ex­tremely con­ve­nient – mov­ing from the bed to my work desk and to the liv­ing room – that was how I lived for many months, es­pe­cially when we were ad­vised not to leave our homes un­nec­es­sar­ily,” said Mr Lim, who now works al­ter­nate weeks from home.</p>
    <p>Like him, many peo­ple have re­duced their daily phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties due to re­stric­tions brought about by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. But doc­tors warn that un­der­us­ing one’s mus­cles may have se­ri­ous con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Dr Lau Pik Onn, a se­nior res­i­dent physi­cian at pri­vate med­i­cal clinic Icon Health Screen­ing, said: “The re­duc­tion in phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity and move­ment dur­ing the pan­demic, es­pe­cially in adults and se­niors, can lead to the loss of mus­cle mass and func­tion, a con­di­tion called sar­cope­nia.”</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Choon Kit, a fam­ily physi­cian at Mis­sion Med­i­cal Clinic in Seran­goon, said that lately, he has seen more el­derly pa­tients suf­fer­ing from a loss of mus­cle mass.</p>
    <p>He said: “I think the cir­cum­stances lim­it­ing the move­ment of the el­derly, their fam­i­lies restrict­ing them for fear of them con­tract­ing Covid-19 and their own fear of catch­ing the virus, all have a part to play in caus­ing in­ac­tiv­ity and the loss of mus­cle mass.”</p>
    <p>While los­ing mus­cle is part of age­ing, it also af­fects peo­ple who have a seden­tary life­style or are phys­i­cally in­ac­tive for an ex­tended pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>If a mus­cle is not used, the body will even­tu­ally break it down to con­serve en­ergy, ex­plained Dr Lau.</p>
    <p>Signs of mus­cle mass loss in­clude fa­tigue and a drop in en­ergy lev­els, a slower walk­ing speed, de­creased strength, gen­eral weak­ness and fre­quent falls.</p>
    <p>A weaker hand grip, such as dif­fi­culty open­ing a jar, can also be a sign of pro­gres­sive loss of mus­cle mass.</p>
    <p>The con­di­tion can af­fect a per­son’s bal­ance, gait and daily tasks, such as walk­ing, climb­ing the stairs and lift­ing ob­jects.</p>
    <p>Dr Lau said stud­ies have shown that peo­ple start to lose mus­cle mass from as early as 40 years old, with a drop of about 8 per cent of mus­cle mass every decade. The rate al­most dou­bles to 15 per cent every decade af­ter age 70.</p>
    <p>Mr Rethi­nam Gane­san, a se­nior phys­io­ther­a­pist at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, said that while peo­ple above age 40 have a higher rate of mus­cle mass loss, those be­low 40 should also be con­cerned.</p>
    <p>“Preven­tion should com­mence be­fore the on­set of mus­cle mass loss. Early preven­tion re­duces the risk of falls and frac­tures. It also in­creases the lifes­pan and im­proves the qual­ity of life of an in­di­vid­ual,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mus­cle mass loss could also be the re­sult of a poor diet and low­ered sex hor­mones, such as low oe­stro­gen dur­ing menopause and low testos­terone dur­ing an­dropause.</p>
    <p>Dr Lau said it is im­por­tant to eat a bal­anced diet with ad­e­quate pro­tein and vi­ta­min D, and to avoid sug­ary and pro­cessed food.</p>
    <p>“Pro­tein pro­vides the build­ing blocks for mus­cle and stim­u­lates its growth, while low vi­ta­min D has been as­so­ci­ated with a higher risk of sar­cope­nia,” she said.</p>
    <p>Foods rich in pro­tein in­clude eggs, meat, cheese, yo­gurt, nuts, beans and legumes.</p>
    <p>“One should aim for 1.2g of pro­tein for every 1kg of body weight, es­pe­cially the el­derly,” added Dr Lau.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the loss of mus­cle mass, a lack of ex­er­cise and phys­i­cal move­ment can also lead to other health prob­lems.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Reshma Mer­chant of the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore said a seden­tary life­style can im­pair glu­cose tol­er­ance and re­duce in­sulin sen­si­tiv­ity, which may lead to chronic diseases such as di­a­betes, obe­sity, and meta­bolic syn­drome.</p>
    <p>Dr Chan Kin Ming, a geri­atric spe­cial­ist at Chan KM Geri­atric & Med­i­cal Clinic, said peo­ple who are not eat­ing well or meet­ing their nu­tri­tional re­quire­ments through food can con­sider tak­ing a sup­ple­ment that con­tains beta-hy­droxy-be­tamethyl­bu­tyrate, also known as HMB.</p>
    <p>HMB is a leucine me­tab­o­lite that helps to coun­ter­act mus­cle loss. It is nat­u­rally pro­duced in small amounts when the body breaks down leucine, an es­sen­tial amino acid that can be ob­tained from foods such as milk, Greek yo­gurt, soya beans, beef and chicken.</p>
    <p>“It slows mus­cle break­down and sup­ports the build­ing, re­pair­ing and pro­tec­tion of mus­cle tis­sue. While HMB is found in our body, the level de­clines with age,” said Dr Chan.</p>
    <p>Foods such as av­o­cado and cau­li­flower con­tain small amounts of HMB, but get­ting enough HMB through food alone can be chal­leng­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal ex­er­cise, both strength train­ing and car­dio­vas­cu­lar, is also im­por­tant to main­tain mus­cle health and strength.</p>
    <p>Strength and re­sis­tance train­ing ex­er­cise, at least twice a week, is the most ef­fec­tive way to pre­vent mus­cle loss, said Dr Lau.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes weightlift­ing, pulling against re­sis­tance bands or mov­ing part of the body against grav­ity, such as climb­ing the stairs and do­ing leg presses, or ex­tend­ing the knees against re­sis­tance on a weight ma­chine.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Gane­san: “When a per­son en­gages in a rou­tine strength­en­ing ex­er­cise reg­i­men, it helps to pro­vide a con­stant chal­lenge to achieve mus­cle growth or main­te­nance, pre­vent­ing the oc­cur­rence of mus­cle loss.”</p>
    <p>Daily phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties like do­ing house­hold chores can help main­tain mus­cle mass as well, he noted.</p>
    <p>Aerobic ex­er­cises such as walk­ing, cy­cling and jog­ging also work.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong said the loss of mus­cle mass is typ­i­cally as­so­ci­ated with the un­der­use of mus­cles.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for a stroll af­ter a meal is much bet­ter than watch­ing TV on a couch. Ev­ery­one should be con­cerned about mus­cle wast­ing. What we don’t use will be taken away from us,” he said.</p>
