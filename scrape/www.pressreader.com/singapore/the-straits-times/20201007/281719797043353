    <p>About a decade ago, a young rel­a­tive of Mr Zhulka­r­nain Ab­dul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC) suf­fered com­pli­ca­tions af­ter surgery and died in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Her dis­traught par­ents, who had en­vi­sioned at­tend­ing her grad­u­a­tion from univer­sity one day, were at a loss and sought an ex­pla­na­tion. They filed a com­plaint against the hos­pi­tal and at­tend­ing doc­tors, he re­counted in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion process took more than two years and, even­tu­ally, it was found there was no wrong­do­ing or neg­li­gence by the doc­tors. “Al­though there was fi­nal­ity to the process, the sheer du­ra­tion did not give the fam­ily any clo­sure nor heal any wounds,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhulka­r­nain was among 11 MPs who spoke at the de­bate on the Med­i­cal Reg­is­tra­tion (Amend­ment) Bill and Civil Law (Amend­ment) Bill, both of which were later passed.</p>
    <p>Some MPs, in­clud­ing Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC) and Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC), spoke in per­sonal terms of their rel­a­tives and res­i­dents. But all wel­comed the changes, highlighti­ng the faster process in re­solv­ing com­plaints and greater clar­ity for doc­tors on what they need to tell pa­tients for in­formed de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhulka­r­nain said the short­ened in­ves­ti­ga­tion process is im­por­tant as it al­lows com­plainants to get clo­sure ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who is a med­i­cal doc­tor and whose father was a can­cer pa­tient, agreed. He noted that de­layed justice is un­fair to both pa­tients and their fam­i­lies, who may have to wait many years for an out­come. It is also un­fair to an ac­cused per­son.</p>
    <p>At least three med­i­cal doc­tors spoke on the changes, in­clud­ing Senior Min­is­ter of State for Health Koh Poh Koon.</p>
    <p>He wel­comed the move to take into ac­count the pro­fes­sional opin­ions of peers in set­ting out the new statu­tory test of a health­care pro­fes­sional’s duty in giv­ing med­i­cal ad­vice to a pa­tient. This is a pro­vi­sion in the Civil Law (Amend­ment) Bill.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing from his own ex­pe­ri­ence, he said there are oc­ca­sions where a doc­tor may need to take some pro­fes­sional risk by with­hold­ing in­for­ma­tion from a pa­tient, who may be in de­nial about his con­di­tion, in or­der to con­vince him to un­dergo life-sav­ing surgery.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a can­cer pa­tient’s chil­dren may ask a doc­tor not to tell their par­ent that he has can­cer, as they know he will refuse treat­ment.</p>
    <p>In such a sit­u­a­tion, a doc­tor may have to spend time talk­ing to the fam­ily as well, to help them un­der­stand the con­text in which the de­ci­sion has to be made and why surgery is nec­es­sary, he added.</p>
    <p>Most of the MPs, in­clud­ing Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sem­bawang GRC), said there should be ad­e­quate re­sources and man­power al­lo­cated to com­mit­tees in charge of dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong said grants have been given to the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil to set up the new mech­a­nisms and re­de­ploy re­sources.</p>
    <p>Mr Pri­tam Singh (Alju­nied GRC) and Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) said doc­tors with lim­ited con­sul­ta­tion time for pa­tients, ow­ing to a heavy work­load, may strug­gle to com­ply with the new statu­tory test in the Civil Law Act.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong as­sured MPs that the Min­istry of Health takes se­ri­ously the is­sue of ad­di­tional work­load po­ten­tially un­der­min­ing the qual­ity of care.</p>
    <p>“We may have to find ways to put bet­ter re­sources in pub­lic hos­pi­tals or poly­clin­ics, but... we must first fo­cus on what is good for the pa­tient and doc­tor in that re­la­tion­ship.”</p>
    <p>Anec­do­tal ev­i­dence, he added, does not in­di­cate to him that the new test will in­crease a doc­tor’s con­sul­ta­tion time.</p>
    <p>Still, the Gov­ern­ment will ex­am­ine if there are sys­temic is­sues that may be bar­ri­ers to the med­i­cal pro­fes­sion adapt­ing to the leg­isla­tive changes, he added.</p>
