    <p>SACRA­MENTO • Cal­i­for­nia’s gov­er­nor has clamped new re­stric­tions on busi­nesses as coro­n­avirus cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions soar, while the state’s two largest school dis­tricts – in Los Angeles and San Diego – said chil­dren will be made to stay home next month.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som, a Demo­crat, on Mon­day or­dered bars closed and restau­rants, movie theatres, zoos and mu­se­ums across the na­tion’s most pop­u­lous state to cease in­door op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Gyms, churches and hair sa­lons must close in the 30 hard­est-hit coun­ties.</p>
    <p>“It’s in­cum­bent upon all of us to recog­nise soberly that Covid-19 is not go­ing away any time soon, un­til there is a vac­cine and/or an ef­fec­tive ther­apy,” Mr New­som said at a news brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor called the move crit­i­cal to stem­ming a surge i n Covid-19 cases that has strained hos­pi­tals in sev­eral of Cal­i­for­nia’s ru­ral coun­ties.</p>
    <p>The United States on Mon­day con­firmed 65,488 new coro­n­avirus cases, ac­cord­ing to the Worl­dome­ter web­site. That put the to­tal num­ber of cases in the US, the na­tion hard­est hit by the global pan­demic, at more than 3.47 mil­lion yes­ter­day. An­other 465 deaths were re­ported on Mon­day and 167 yes­ter­day, with the to­tal toll at 138,247.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic school dis­tricts for Los Angeles and San Diego, which in­struct a com­bined 706,000 stu­dents and em­ploy 88,000 peo­ple, said in a joint state­ment that they will teach only on­line when classes re­sume next month, cit­ing “vague and con­tra­dic­tory” sci­ence and gov­ern­ment guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The dis­tricts said coun­tries that have safely re­opened schools have done so only af­ter es­tab­lish­ing de­clin­ing in­fec­tion rates and on-de­mand coro­n­avirus test­ing.</p>
    <p>“Cal­i­for­nia has nei­ther,” the state­ment said, adding: “The sky-rock­et­ing in­fec­tion rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pan­demic is not un­der con­trol.”</p>
    <p>The union rep­re­sent­ing Los Angeles teach­ers ap­plauded the strat­egy in a sep­a­rate state­ment re­leased shortly af­ter the school shut­downs were an­nounced.</p>
    <p>“In the face of the alarm­ing spike in Covid-19 cases, the lack of nec­es­sary fund­ing from the gov­ern­ment to open schools safely and the out­sized threat of death faced by work­ing-class com­mu­ni­ties of colour, there re­ally is no other choice that doesn’t put thou­sands of lives at risk,” United Teach­ers Los Angeles said.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to can­cel in-per­son classes puts the dis­tricts at odds with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who has said he might with­hold fed­eral fund­ing or re­move tax-ex­empt sta­tus from school sys­tems that refuse to re­open.</p>
    <p>Most ed­u­ca­tion fund­ing comes from state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials have said that data does not sug­gest at­tend­ing school would be dan­ger­ous for chil­dren be­cause their in­fec­tion rates are far lower than those of the pop­u­la­tion at large.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the Cal­i­for­nia dis­tricts’ an­nounce­ment, the White House re­it­er­ated that the ideal sce­nario is for stu­dents to go to school.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, Los Angeles and San Diego can get there soon as well, as that is what is best for chil­dren.” spokesman Judd Deer said.</p>
    <p>Mr New­som, who has said dur­ing the pan­demic that it was up to lo­cal school dis­tricts to de­ter­mine how best to ed­u­cate their stu­dents, cheered the an­nounce­ments by Los Angeles and San Diego.</p>
    <p>But Re­pub­li­cans crit­i­cised the gov­er­nor for fail­ing to issue statewide guide­lines for schools dur­ing the health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“While he con­tin­ues to blame Cal­i­for­ni­ans for his fail­ure in lead­er­ship, his de­mands to close our small busi­nesses and lack of direc­tion on open­ing schools will fur­ther harm Cal­i­for­nia’s school­child­ren and the small busi­nesses that fuel our econ­omy,” Ms Jes­sica Mil­lan Pat­ter­son, chair­man of the Cal­i­for­nia Re­pub­li­can Party, said in a writ­ten state­ment.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia as well as Florida, Ari­zona and Texas have emerged as the new US epi­cen­tres of the pan­demic. In­fec­tions have risen rapidly in about 40 of the 50 states over the last two weeks, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>De­spite nearly 28,000 new Covid-19 cases in the last two days in Florida, Walt Dis­ney World in Orlando wel­comed the pub­lic last Satur­day for the first time since March, with guests re­quired to wear masks, un­dergo tem­per­a­ture checks and keep phys­i­cally apart.</p>
