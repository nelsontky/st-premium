    <p>Bri­tish pop icon El­ton John has de­clared The Weeknd’s smash hit song Blind­ing Lights as his per­sonal choice for Song and Record of the Year.</p>
    <p>John took to In­sta­gram to ex­press his sup­port for the Cana­dian singer fol­low­ing his Grammy nom­i­na­tions snub on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>He posted the song’s art­work, start­ing his cap­tion with “In my hum­ble opin­ion...” be­fore call­ing Blind­ing Lights both song and record of the year, along with the #Gram­mySnub hash­tag.</p>
    <p>The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tes­faye, hit out at the Record­ing Academy on Wed­nes­day af­ter his crit­i­cally ac­claimed al­bum Af­ter Hours and its chart-top­ping sin­gles were over­looked for next year’s cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Be­sides la­belling the Gram­mys “cor­rupt”, Tes­faye tweeted that the Academy “owe me, my fans and the in­dus­try trans­parency”.</p>
    <p>Record­ing Academy chair Har­vey Ma­son later re­sponded to the singer via Rolling Stone, ex­plain­ing in a state­ment that “there are fewer nom­i­na­tions than the num­ber of de­serv­ing artists”.</p>
    <p>He said that he was also sur­prised The Weeknd did not re­ceive any nom­i­na­tions, and con­firmed re­ports that the artist was orig­i­nally ex­pected to per­form at the Gram­mys on Jan 31, as well as the Su­per Bowl the fol­low­ing week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he de­nied that ne­go­ti­a­tions around play­ing both high­pro­file shows – which sources al­lege be­came con­tentious – had any role in The Weeknd get­ting shut out of nom­i­na­tions lists this year.</p>
    <p>“To be clear, vot­ing in all cat­e­gories ended well be­fore The Weeknd’s per­for­mance at the Su­per Bowl was an­nounced, so in no way could it have af­fected the nom­i­na­tion process,” said Mr Ma­son.</p>
