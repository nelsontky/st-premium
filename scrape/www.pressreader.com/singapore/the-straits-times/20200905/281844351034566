    <p>The two 42-day tri­als – in­clud­ing 38 healthy adults each – did not find any se­ri­ous ad­verse ef­fects among par­tic­i­pants, and con­firmed that the vac­cine can­di­dates elicit an an­ti­body re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Large, long-term tri­als in­clud­ing a placebo com­par­i­son, and fur­ther mon­i­tor­ing, are needed to es­tab­lish the long-term safety and ef­fec­tive­ness of the vac­cine for pre­vent­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s “Sput­nik-V” Covid-19 vac­cine pro­duced an an­ti­body re­sponse in all par­tic­i­pants in early-stage tri­als, ac­cord­ing to re­sults pub­lished yes­ter­day by The Lancet med­i­cal jour­nal that were hailed by Moscow as an an­swer to its crit­ics.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the two tri­als, con­ducted be­tween June and July and in­volv­ing 76 par­tic­i­pants, showed 100 per cent of par­tic­i­pants de­vel­op­ing an­ti­bod­ies to the coro­n­avirus and no se­ri­ous side ef­fects, The Lancet said.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia li­censed the two-shot jab for do­mes­tic use last month, the first coun­try to do so and be­fore any data had been pub­lished or a large-scale trial be­gun.</p>
    <p>“The two 42-day tri­als – in­clud­ing 38 healthy adults each – did not find any se­ri­ous ad­verse ef­fects among par­tic­i­pants, and con­firmed that the vac­cine can­di­dates elicit an an­ti­body re­sponse,” The Lancet said.</p>
    <p>“Large, long-term tri­als in­clud­ing a placebo com­par­i­son, and fur­ther mon­i­tor­ing, are needed to es­tab­lish the long-term safety and ef­fec­tive­ness of the vac­cine for pre­vent­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tion,” it said.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine is named Sput­nik-V in homage to the world’s first satel­lite, launched by the Soviet Union. Some West­ern ex­perts have warned against us­ing it be­fore all in­ter­na­tion­ally ap­proved test­ing and reg­u­la­tory steps have been taken.</p>
    <p>But with the re­sults now pub­lished for the first time in an in­ter­na­tional peer-re­viewed jour­nal, and with a 40,000-strong lat­er­stage trial launched last week, a se­nior Rus­sian of­fi­cial said Moscow had faced down its crit­ics abroad.</p>
    <p>“With this (pub­li­ca­tion), we an­swer all of the ques­tions of the West that were dili­gently asked over the past three weeks, frankly with the clear goal of tar­nish­ing the Rus­sian vac­cine,” said Mr Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Rus­sian Direct In­vest­ment Fund, Rus­sia’s sov­er­eign wealth fund, which has backed the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“All of the boxes are checked,” he told Reuters. “Now... we will start ask­ing ques­tions of some of the West­ern vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>Mr Dmitriev said at least 3,000 peo­ple had al­ready been re­cruited for the large-scale trial of the Sput­nik-V vac­cine launched last week, and ini­tial re­sults were ex­pected next month or Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the re­sults of the early-stage tri­als, lead author Naor Bar-Zeev of the In­ter­na­tional Vac­cine Ac­cess Cen­tre, Johns Hop­kins Bloomberg School of Pub­lic Health in the US, said the stud­ies were “en­cour­ag­ing but small”.</p>
    <p>Dr Bar-Zeev, who was not in­volved in the study, said “clin­i­cal ef­fi­cacy for any Covid-19 vac­cine has not yet been shown”.</p>
    <p>RACE TO DE­VELOP VAC­CINE</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments and big phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms are rac­ing to de­velop a vac­cine to end the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has killed more than 850,000 peo­ple glob­ally and in­fected around 26 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>More than half a dozen drug­mak­ers are al­ready con­duct­ing ad­vanced clin­i­cal tri­als, each with tens of thou­sands of par­tic­i­pants and sev­eral, in­clud­ing Bri­tain’s As­traZeneca and US drug­mak­ers Moderna and Pfizer, expect to know if their Covid-19 vac­cines work and are safe by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The Lancet said the early-stage tri­als sug­gested the Sput­nik-V vac­cine pro­duced a re­sponse in a com­po­nent of the im­mune sys­tem known as T cells.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have been scru­ti­n­is­ing the role played by T cells in bat­tling coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion, with re­cent find­ings show­ing these cells may pro­vide longer-term pro­tec­tion than an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine, de­vel­oped by Moscow’s Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute, is ad­min­is­tered in two doses, with each based on a dif­fer­ent vec­tor that normally causes the com­mon cold: hu­man ade­n­oviruses Ad5 and Ad26.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts have said that us­ing this de­liv­ery mech­a­nism could make a Covid-19 vac­cine less ef­fec­tive, since many peo­ple have al­ready been ex­posed to the Ad5 ade­n­ovirus and de­vel­oped im­mu­nity to it.</p>
    <p>In China and the United States, about 40 per cent of peo­ple have high lev­els of an­ti­bod­ies from prior Ad5 ex­po­sure. In Africa, it could be as high as 80 per cent, ex­perts have said.</p>
    <p>Dr De­nis Lo­gunov, one of the vac­cine’s de­vel­op­ers at the Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute, told Reuters the vac­cine uses a strong enough dose of Ad5 to over­come any ear­lier im­mu­nity, with­out com­pro­mis­ing safety.</p>
    <p>The booster dose, based on the rarer Ad26 ade­n­ovirus, pro­vides fur­ther sup­port be­cause the like­li­hood of wide­spread im­mu­nity to both types in the pop­u­la­tion is min­i­mal, he said.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has said it ex­pects to pro­duce be­tween 1.5 mil­lion and two mil­lion doses per month of its po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine by the end of the year, grad­u­ally in­creas­ing pro­duc­tion to six mil­lion doses a month.</p>
