    <p>TraceTo­gether to­kens will be dis­trib­uted na­tion­wide start­ing on Mon­day, as Sin­ga­pore strength­ens its con­tact trac­ing net­work in prepa­ra­tion for al­low­ing larger gath­er­ings when it opens up fur­ther.</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether to­kens will be dis­trib­uted na­tion­wide start­ing next Mon­day, as Sin­ga­pore strength­ens its con­tact trac­ing net­work in prepa­ra­tion for al­low­ing larger gath­er­ings while it opens up fur­ther.</p>
    <p>A pi­lot scheme re­quir­ing peo­ple to use ei­ther the free to­kens or the mo­bile app to check in at cer­tain venues will also start next month, said Min­is­ter-in-Charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan yes­ter­day at a press con­fer­ence by the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the app has been down­loaded 2.4 mil­lion times so far, he added: “But we ac­tu­ally still want to push par­tic­i­pa­tion in this pro­gramme be­cause this is one of those things where the more peo­ple we have on board, the more ef­fec­tive the level of pro­tec­tion af­forded to all of us.”</p>
    <p>The lo­cally de­vel­oped TraceTo­gether pro­gramme helps with con­tact trac­ing ef­forts by iden­ti­fy­ing nearby phones with the app in­stalled, en­abling the au­thor­i­ties to iden­tify a per­son’s close con­tacts if needed.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents in Jalan Be­sar and Tan­jong Pa­gar will be the first to get the to­kens. These dis­tricts have a larger pro­por­tion of seniors who are more vul­ner­a­ble to Covid-19 and may have dif­fi­culty us­ing the ex­ist­ing TraceTo­gether app, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These changes come as Sin­ga­pore pre­pares to al­low big­ger meet­ings and con­fer­ences with up to 250 par­tic­i­pants, and will mean that SafeEn­try check-in data is sup­ple­mented with prox­im­ity data from TraceTo­gether.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan said: “For these sorts of events where you’re go­ing to have more peo­ple in­ter­act­ing, it’s not enough to just know who has been in this build­ing, say, in the last hour. You ac­tu­ally want to know, of that group of peo­ple who hap­pen to be in the build­ing, who ac­tu­ally has been in close prox­im­ity to each other.”</p>
    <p>This ap­proach could al­low for a safer in­crease in ca­pac­ity lim­its at larger events and premises with any po­ten­tial fu­ture eas­ing of mea­sures, MOH added.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the Covid-19 task force with Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, said en­force­ment agen­cies will also be step­ping up spot checks at food and bev­er­age out­lets.</p>
    <p>They will take im­me­di­ate ac­tion if rules are bro­ken, in­clud­ing is­su­ing fines or even or­der­ing a busi­ness to shut if the breach is se­ri­ous enough. This ap­plies even to first­time of­fend­ers, Mr Wong added.</p>
    <p>He noted that breaches of the rules hap­pen “lit­er­ally on a daily ba­sis”, in­clud­ing peo­ple drink­ing af­ter 10.30pm or or­gan­is­ing gath­er­ings of more than five in pri­vate rooms at restau­rants.</p>
    <p>“The op­er­a­tors who are do­ing this are caus­ing un­nec­es­sary risk to their din­ers, and I think it’s also not fair for the ma­jor­ity of op­er­a­tors who are com­ply­ing with the rules,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>More se­nior-cen­tric ac­tiv­i­ties will also be al­lowed to re­sume, although these will be lim­ited to small groups of five, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>These in­clude pro­grammes or­gan­ised by the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion and Health Pro­mo­tion Board, as well as sim­i­lar ac­tiv­i­ties in nurs­ing homes and se­nior care cen­tres.</p>
    <p>“Group ac­tiv­i­ties are an in­te­gral part of the se­nior-cen­tric pro­grammes as they help ad­dress our seniors’ psy­cho-so­cial needs and con­trib­ute to their over­all well-be­ing,” Mr Gan added.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore is sta­ble for the time be­ing, but let us con­tinue to keep up our vig­i­lance and not let the virus have a chance to spread.”</p>
