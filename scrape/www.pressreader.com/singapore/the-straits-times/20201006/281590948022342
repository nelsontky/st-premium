    <p>As Chi­nese mil­i­tary pres­sure grows, Tai­wan is shift­ing to asym­met­ric re­sponses. The ques­tion is whether the United States will come to its aid, says global af­fairs correspond­ent Goh Sui Noi (be­low).</p>
    <p>China’s mil­i­tary pres­sure on</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has been mount­ing, par­tic­u­larly in re­cent months as ties be­tween the self-ruled is­land and the United States have strength­ened and Sino-US re­la­tions have soured.</p>
    <p>Last month, over two days, nearly 40 Chi­nese mil­i­tary air­craft crossed the me­dian line in the Tai­wan Strait, the un­of­fi­cial bor­der be­tween the two sides, as US Un­der­sec­re­tary of State Keith Krach was vis­it­ing Taipei. Chi­nese na­tion­al­is­tic tabloid Global Times wrote that these drills “are not a warn­ing, but a re­hearsal for a Tai­wan takeover”.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the Chi­nese sent two fighter jets across the me­dian line and held com­bat drills in the Tai­wan Strait when US Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar vis­ited Tai­wan. Mr Azar was the most senior US of­fi­cial to visit Tai­wan in the four decades since Washington es­tab­lished for­mal ties with Bei­jing in 1979 and de-recog­nised Taipei. In China’s eyes, his visit vi­o­lated Washington’s one-China pol­icy of recog­nis­ing only Bei­jing as the sole gov­ern­ment of China. China has been ramp­ing up pres­sure on Tai­wan mil­i­tar­ily, po­lit­i­cally and eco­nom­i­cally ever since Ms Tsai Ing-wen of the in­de­pen­dence-lean­ing Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party came to power in 2016.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army has been con­duct­ing ex­er­cises in the Tai­wan Strait more fre­quently and its mil­i­tary air­craft have en­cir­cled the is­land with in­creas­ing fre­quency. Its air­craft car­ri­ers Liaon­ing and Shan­dong have sailed through the strait too.</p>
    <p>De­spite the mil­i­tary in­tim­i­da­tion, Ms Tsai won a sec­ond term in Jan­uary. The lat­est Chi­nese mil­i­tary manoeuvres are a strong re­minder to the Tai­wanese – and the US – that China has not and will not aban­don the use of force to wrest back con­trol of what it con­sid­ers a break­away prov­ince. As Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping made clear in a speech in Jan­uary last year, China “must be and will be re­uni­fied” and this goal should not drag on from gen­er­a­tion to gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Tai­wan is in­creas­ing its de­fence spend­ing and adopt­ing a mul­ti­ple-de­ter­rence strat­egy to make up for its David-ver­sus-Go­liath mil­i­tary im­bal­ance with China. But it is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly ap­par­ent that in the event of a Chi­nese at­tack, Tai­wan would not be able to de­fend it­self with­out out­side help. The burn­ing ques­tion is whether the US will go to Tai­wan’s aid.</p>
    <p>MIL­I­TARY IM­BAL­ANCE</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Tai­wan an­nounced an in­crease in its de­fence bud­get from this year’s NT$411.3 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$19.4 bil­lion) to NT$453.4 bil­lion next year, a spike of about 10.2 per cent. But this is nowhere close to China’s de­fence bud­get this year of US$178 bil­lion (S$242 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>So it was no won­der that the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman brushed off news of the in­crease in Tai­wan’s de­fence bud­get with the re­mark that</p>
    <p>Tai­wan was “still a small place” and that “con­fronting the main­land is like an ant try­ing to shake a tree”.</p>
    <p>Things were quite dif­fer­ent in 1980 when the US ended its Mu­tual De­fence Treaty with Tai­wan. At the time, the is­land en­joyed a qual­i­ta­tive edge over the main­land mil­i­tar­ily, which would last through much of the Cold War, wrote Pro­fes­sor Brendan Tay­lor from the Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity in his book Dan­ger­ous Decade: Tai­wan’s Se­cu­rity And Cri­sis Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Al­though China’s troop num­bers at 4.36 mil­lion in 1980 greatly out­num­bered Tai­wan’s 539,000, about 3.6 mil­lion of the Chi­nese sol­diers were in the land forces. China’s navy and air force then were also small and rel­a­tively weak. For in­stance, in terms of ma­jor sur­face com­bat ships, Tai­wan’s out­num­bered China’s by 40 to 25, mean­ing that Bei­jing lacked the power-pro­jec­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties needed to take the is­land by force.</p>
    <p>But from the mid-1990s, that cross-strait mil­i­tary bal­ance be­gan to shift in China’s favour as it mod­ernised its armed forces and in­creased its de­fence spend­ing on the back of its phe­nom­e­nal eco­nomic growth. Ac­cord­ing to the Pen­tagon’s 2020 report on the Chi­nese mil­i­tary, China has 412,000 troops, six am­phibi­ous bri­gades, five air as­sault bri­gades, five air­borne bri­gades, 257 war­ships, 250 bombers and 600 fighter jets based in the Tai­wan Strait area, as well as 1,600 mis­siles placed op­po­site Tai­wan. By com­par­i­son, Tai­wan has 88,000 ac­tive-duty ground troops, 109 sur­face ships in­clud­ing coast guard ves­sels and 400 fighter jets in to­tal.</p>
    <p>The US De­fence In­tel­li­gence Agency said in a Jan­uary report that China con­tin­ues to take am­bi­tious steps to mod­ernise and bet­ter equip its mil­i­tary, driven by its “long­stand­ing in­ter­est to even­tu­ally com­pel Tai­wan’s re­uni­fi­ca­tion with the main­land and de­ter any at­tempt by Tai­wan to de­clare in­de­pen­dence”.</p>
    <p>ASYM­MET­RIC DE­FENCE STRAT­EGY</p>
    <p>Given how lop­sided the mil­i­tary bal­ance has be­come, Tai­wan in re­cent years has opted for a strat­egy of mul­ti­ple de­ter­rence, that is, us­ing “in­no­va­tive, asym­met­ric” means to com­ple­ment its con­ven­tional mil­i­tary power.</p>
    <p>Such a strat­egy en­tails “not only pro­tect­ing our ter­ri­to­rial bound­aries, but also hav­ing the ca­pa­bil­ity to de­stroy any po­ten­tial mil­i­tary threats com­ing di­rectly from the other side”, said Mr An­drew Yang, a Tai­wanese de­fence ex­pert.</p>
    <p>It means, among other things, hav­ing a very ef­fec­tive and strong air de­fence sys­tem so that China faces tremen­dous chal­lenges if it de­cides to go on the of­fen­sive. Other an­a­lysts said that for air power, Tai­wan should fo­cus on rel­a­tively in­ex­pen­sive, semi-au­ton­o­mous un­manned aerial sys­tems, armed or un­armed, that can con­duct sim­ple dis­trib­uted oper­a­tions and do not rely on eas­ily de­graded air­fields.</p>
    <p>De­fence an­a­lysts also noted that sea mines are a crit­i­cal ca­pa­bil­ity as they have proven hard to counter and are ef­fec­tive at slow­ing in­va­sive forces, as are highly mo­bile coastal de­fence cruise mis­siles.</p>
    <p>While this asym­met­ric de­fence strat­egy of us­ing un­con­ven­tional war­fare against a stronger ad­ver­sary was first pro­pounded in 2017, Tai­wan’s na­tional se­cu­rity of­fi­cials have been slow in adopt­ing it, con­tin­u­ing to fo­cus in­stead on pres­tige weapons sys­tems such as Abrams tanks and indige­nous diesel sub­marines, which are costly.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as mil­i­tary pres­sure from the main­land has in­creased, asym­met­ric war­fare has gained at­ten­tion again.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai, in her in­au­gu­ral speech in May, said that while Tai­wan would con­tinue to bol­ster its de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties, “fu­ture com­bat ca­pac­ity de­vel­op­ment will also em­pha­sise mo­bil­ity, coun­ter­mea­sures and non-tra­di­tional, asym­met­ri­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>In July, dur­ing its Han Kuang mil­i­tary ex­er­cise, Tai­wan tested this new con­cept, sim­u­lat­ing a coastal at­tack from China that saw a shift from its re­liance on heavy ar­moured forces to in­te­grated asym­met­ric de­fence.</p>
    <p>The idea, said Mr Yang, is to make it very dif­fi­cult for China to con­tinue its mil­i­tary ac­tions against Tai­wan and to cre­ate “a lot of in­ter­na­tional con­cern and re­sponses to Chi­nese rene­gade be­hav­iour”.</p>
    <p>Many an­a­lysts be­lieve that given the huge dis­par­ity in their mil­i­tary strengths, what Tai­wan’s asym­met­ric strat­egy could do is to buy time be­fore ex­ter­nal sup­port ar­rives.</p>
    <p>WILL AND CAN THE U.S. HELP?</p>
    <p>The ex­ter­nal sup­port that an­a­lysts talk about is re­ally US in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Even as the US de-recog­nised Tai­wan in 1979, it also passed the Tai­wan Re­la­tions Act (TRA) that ob­li­gated it to main­tain the ca­pac­ity “to re­sist any re­sort to force or other forms of co­er­cion” jeop­ar­dis­ing the se­cu­rity or so­cial or eco­nomic sys­tem of Tai­wan’s peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Act, the US is also to “make avail­able to Tai­wan such de­fence ar­ti­cles and de­fence ser­vices in such quan­tity as may be nec­es­sary to en­able Tai­wan to main­tain a suf­fi­cient self-de­fence ca­pa­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>While some US pres­i­dents have been ju­di­cious about arms sales to Tai­wan so as not to ir­ri­tate the Chi­nese too much, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has had no such qualms.</p>
    <p>In the past four years, his ad­min­is­tra­tion has ap­proved sev­eral ma­jor arms sales to the is­land to­talling US$13 bil­lion and in­clud­ing F-16 fighter jets, tanks, por­ta­ble anti-air­craft mis­siles and tor­pe­does.</p>
    <p>It is now re­port­edly plan­ning to sell seven ma­jor weapons sys­tems in­clud­ing mines, cruise mis­siles and drones. How­ever, the US has been am­bigu­ous about whether it will go to Tai­wan’s aid in the event of an at­tack by China. The TRA re­quires only that the US pres­i­dent and Congress de­ter­mine “ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion” in re­sponse to any threat to the se­cu­rity or the so­cial or eco­nomic sys­tem of Tai­wan and any dan­ger to US in­ter­ests as a re­sult of this.</p>
    <p>This strate­gic am­bi­gu­ity, say an­a­lysts, has helped to pre­serve the peace in the Tai­wan Strait as it keeps both the Chi­nese and Tai­wanese in check.</p>
    <p>But there have been calls for strate­gic clar­ity re­cently as ten­sions have risen in the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing in the For­eign Af­fairs mag­a­zine, Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions re­searchers Richard Haass and David Sacks ar­gued that given an in­creas­ingly as­sertive China with grow­ing mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties and grow­ing doubts over US re­li­a­bil­ity, the US should make it ex­plicit that it would re­spond to any Chi­nese use of force against Tai­wan so as to main­tain de­ter­rence in the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers said such strate­gic clar­ity would em­bolden Tai­wan to be less cau­tious and more likely to trig­ger con­fronta­tion with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>What many an­a­lysts agreed on is that the US should com­mit re­sources to bol­ster de­ter­rence in the strait and work with Tai­wan to in­crease its war-fight­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There are those who are of the view that the US will go to Tai­wan’s aid in the event of an at­tack for two rea­sons – one is that demo­cratic Tai­wan rep­re­sents val­ues that re­flect the US’ own and a war also hurts US eco­nomic in­ter­ests as both are its ma­jor trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond is that not de­fend­ing Tai­wan will have dev­as­tat­ing con­se­quences for US ties with treaty al­lies Ja­pan and South Korea, and will be a blow to its cred­i­bil­ity among other al­lies and US-friendly coun­tries in the re­gion and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese schol­ars, how­ever, point out that the US has aban­doned Tai­wan be­fore, when it sought rap­proche­ment with China in 1972 and nor­malised ties with Bei­jing in 1979, and could do so again. In their view, Amer­i­cans see Tai­wan as a mere pawn, one not worth sac­ri­fic­ing their own in­ter­ests for.</p>
    <p>Prof Tay­lor warned against un­der­es­ti­mat­ing US will­ing­ness to de­fend Tai­wan, al­beit at sub­stan­tial cost and risks, “in this era of deep­en­ing US-China strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion”.</p>
    <p>He said, how­ever, that with each pass­ing year, the abil­ity of the US to come to Tai­wan’s aid is di­min­ish­ing, par­tic­u­larly as China de­vel­ops a for­mi­da­ble arsenal of “anti-ac­cess, area-de­nial” ca­pa­bil­i­ties that will en­hance its abil­ity to hold US forces at arm’s length and that, in time, “will largely re­move Amer­ica’s abil­ity to in­ter­vene in a cross-strait con­flict”.</p>
    <p>He warned that the tip­ping point looks set to oc­cur “well within the next decade”.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has few op­tions in the face of such an even­tu­al­ity. Apart from its de­fence strat­egy of mak­ing it as un­palat­able as pos­si­ble for China to take it by force, Tai­wan should make ef­forts to en­gage China and re-es­tab­lish chan­nels of com­mu­ni­ca­tion that will re­duce ten­sions be­tween the two sides and the pos­si­bil­ity of mil­i­tary con­flict.</p>
