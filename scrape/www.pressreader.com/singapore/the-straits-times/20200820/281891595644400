    <p>BEI­JING • China warned that the mas­sive Three Gorges Dam faced its largest-ever flood surge as Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping toured one of the ar­eas hard­est hit by a wave of flood­ing this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Some 74,000 cu­bic m of wa­ter per se­cond was ex­pected to flow into the Three Gorges reser­voir and the Cun­tan area i n the up­per reaches of the Yangtze River yes­ter­day and to­day, the Min­istry of Wa­ter Re­sources said.</p>
    <p>The peak flow was ex­pected to be the most se­vere in al­most four decades and largest since the con­struc­tion of the dam, it said.</p>
    <p>The dam, which has held back the</p>
    <p>Yangtze in Hubei prov­ince since its com­ple­tion in 2006, is the world’s big­gest power plant, five times the size of the Hoover Dam in Ne­vada.</p>
    <p>Since June, the struc­ture has weath­ered se­vere flood­ing that has af­fected over 63 mil­lion peo­ple na­tion­wide and caused some 178 bil­lion yuan (S$35 bil­lion) of eco­nomic dam­age, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Emer­gency Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Mr Xi in­spected flood-con­trol mea­sures on the Huai River, an­other flood-prone wa­ter­way in the ad­ja­cent An­hui prov­ince.</p>
    <p>He urged ef­forts to mod­ernise flood preven­tion mea­sures, adding that China had been “fight­ing nat­u­ral dis­as­ters for mil­len­nia”, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial Xinhua News Agency.</p>
    <p>“We will need to con­tinue the fight,” Mr Xi said. “This fight needs to re­spect na­ture, and fol­low the law of na­ture, and to co-ex­ist with na­ture har­mo­niously.”</p>
    <p>The flood­gate that Mr Xi vis­ited in Fuyang city was near a flood-di­ver­sion area where the au­thor­i­ties re­leased 375 mil­lion cu­bic m of wa­ter last month, sub­merg­ing dozens of vil­lages and swamp­ing thou­sands of hectares of crops.</p>
    <p>The re­lease of flood wa­ter in An­hui’s Mengwa area marked the first time in 13 years that the au­thor­i­ties had taken such ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Floods in China’s key farm­ing ar­eas, to­gether with sup­ply dis­rup­tions caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and lo­cust swarms, have prompted Mr Xi to launch a na­tional cam­paign to curb food waste.</p>
    <p>The trip by the Pres­i­dent high­lighted the risk to not just life and prop­erty, but also the rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party, which has been crit­i­cised for past strug­gles to con­trol the coun­try’s flood-prone rivers.</p>
    <p>The tour rep­re­sented Mr Xi’s first public ap­pear­ance since July 31. Such mid-Au­gust reap­pear­ances by top lead­ers are widely an­tic­i­pated each year as con­fir­ma­tion that the Com­mu­nist Party’s an­nual sum­mer meet­ings in the re­sort area of Bei­daihe have wrapped up.</p>
    <p>The record floods were un­likely to cause ma­jor safety risks to the Three Gorges Dam, the state-run Sci­ence Daily has re­ported. Yet as the Three Gorges ac­cel­er­ates dis­charges to pre­pare for the in­flows, down­stream ar­eas of the Yangtze face higher risk of flood­ing.</p>
