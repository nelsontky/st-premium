    <p>Would you go on a flight to nowhere?</p>
    <p>Fly­ing has not gen­er­ally been con­sid­ered an en­joy­able ex­pe­ri­ence, ex­cept it can take us across dis­tances and con­ti­nents. The flight ser­vice has to be good so as to min­imise the an­guish and dis­com­fort of fly­ing. Un­like with a cruise, where peo­ple can move around, en­gage in many ac­tiv­i­ties and en­joy good food, fly­ing with­out pur­pose is not palat­able. Dae Low</p>
    <p>I would see this as a way to keep our pi­lots and flight at­ten­dants em­ployed. Ev­ery­one is try­ing to sur­vive in this eco­nomic down­turn. Billy Tan</p>
    <p>If Sin­ga­pore Airlines (SIA) is smart, the flight to nowhere would be much like the flights in Tai­wan or Aus­tralia, which take a route for sight­see­ing. Busi­ness- and first-class tick­ets would be cheaper so it can be an op­por­tu­nity for those who have never ex­pe­ri­enced it.</p>
    <p>Wu Kai Ling</p>
    <p>Frankly, I’d rather take a bus or taxi ride to nowhere. I get to see the sur­round­ings. Makes so much more sense than fly­ing to nowhere. Noth­ing to see ex­cept clouds, con­fined to a small space for a pro­longed pe­riod of time, where the legroom is smaller than that of a bus and taxi. And worse, go­ing through all the se­cu­rity. Chong Kian Beng</p>
    <p>It’s typ­i­cal hu­man self­ish­ness at play here – self-en­ti­tle­ment, priv­i­leged men­tal­ity. Flights were meant to be an ef­fi­cient mode of trans­port to a des­ti­na­tion; flights to nowhere are just en­vi­ron­men­tally un­friendly. Jes Chan</p>
    <p>It had bet­ter be much more than the reg­u­lar SIA ser­vice. This air­line will have to be ex­cep­tional in its flights to nowhere or it will vir­tu­ally be out of busi­ness pretty soon. Dex­ter Lee</p>
    <p>I used to fly fre­quently in my pre­vi­ous ca­reer. SIA is one of the best in-flight ser­vice airlines. I would take my chil­dren for a flight to nowhere for them to have some fun and also to sup­port our na­tional air­line. Ge­orge Er</p>
    <p>The amount of money can be spent on a nice meal or high tea with friends in a good ho­tel in Sin­ga­pore. Jerms Lin</p>
    <p>If peo­ple can af­ford it and are bored to death, well, why not? Hira Ah­madi</p>
    <p>It’s one way to gen­er­ate some in­come, up­date pi­lots’ fly­ing hours and train­ing, plus to warm up the tur­bines. Just imag­ine your car parked for months with­out crank­ing up the en­gine. End re­sult? Tow to the work­shop.</p>
    <p>Koh Kheng Joo John­son</p>
    <p>SIA has been most kind to re­fund or de­fer travel with no penalty. Did not ex­pe­ri­ence that sup­port from other airlines, so I will sup­port SIA.</p>
    <p>Ruth Soh</p>
    <p>Now it’s time to save money and be care­ful with how we spend. Is it re­ally worth spend­ing money on a flight to nowhere? Nicholas Rus­sell</p>
