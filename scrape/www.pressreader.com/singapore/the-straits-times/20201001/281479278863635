    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat will de­liver a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment on Sin­ga­pore’s ef­forts to com­bat the coro­n­avirus at 1.30pm on Mon­day, the Min­istry of Fi­nance said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He will also touch on the coun­try’s fis­cal po­si­tion and its strate­gies to emerge stronger from the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>A Sup­ple­men­tary Sup­ply Bill will also be tabled that day to re­al­lo­cate re­sources for $8 bil­lion in ad­di­tional sup­port mea­sures that Mr Heng had an­nounced on Aug 17. Th­ese in­clude an ex­ten­sion of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme to help firms re­tain lo­cal work­ers, and the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant for Sin­ga­pore­ans who are un­em­ployed or have suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss.</p>
    <p>MPs will also de­bate the Bill and th­ese mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat will give a speech out­lin­ing the progress Sin­ga­pore has made in com­bat­ing the coro­n­avirus and its ef­fects, as well as on the coun­try’s fis­cal po­si­tion and its strate­gies to emerge stronger from the cri­sis when Par­lia­ment sits on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>He said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that the Gov­ern­ment will also table a Sup­ple­men­tary Sup­ply Bill – its third this year – on Mon­day to re­al­lo­cate re­sources for the mea­sures he an­nounced on Aug 17 to ex­tend sup­port for busi­nesses and work­ers.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment will de­bate the Bill as well as th­ese mea­sures, which amount to some $8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance, said his min­is­te­rial state­ment next week is meant to pro­vide con­text for the de­bate. “In the face of the pro­found un­cer­tainty ahead, we will con­tinue to adapt and chart a steady course for­ward,” he added.</p>
    <p>In his post, he said that Sin­ga­pore has been bat­tling Covid-19 on all fronts over the past nine months, and close to $100 bil­lion – over four Bud­gets and a fur­ther round of sup­port in Au­gust – has been com­mit­ted to sup­port busi­nesses, work­ers and house­holds.</p>
    <p>“Our col­lec­tive ef­forts as a na­tion have paid off so far. We are now seeing low com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion, but we must re­main vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>“We are pro­gres­sively re­open­ing our econ­omy in a safe man­ner. But there is much un­cer­tainty ahead and many peo­ple are un­der­stand­ably anx­ious about their jobs,” he said, adding that the an­nounce­ment of the ad­di­tional mea­sures had pro­vided much needed cer­tainty to busi­nesses and work­ers.</p>
    <p>Among the key mea­sures an­nounced were ad­just­ments to the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which helps em­ploy­ers fund up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each lo­cal em­ployee, for 10 months up to Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures ex­tend wage sup­port till March next year, tiered based on how quickly each sec­tor is ex­pected to re­cover.</p>
    <p>Firms in the hard­est-hit aerospace, avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors, which were get­ting 75 per cent wage sup­port, get 50 per cent wage sup­port for seven more months.</p>
    <p>The built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor will get 50 per cent sup­port for two more months, be­fore it is low­ered to 30 per cent of wages paid up to March next year, in line with the phased re­sump­tion of con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Most other sec­tors will get 10 per cent sup­port for seven more months.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sec­tors that are do­ing well, such as biomed­i­cal sciences, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions and tech­nol­ogy, will get this amount of sup­port up to De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, in­tro­duced in May to help Sin­ga­pore­ans who have been laid off or have suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss, was ex­tended to De­cem­ber. To qual­ify, un­em­ployed ap­pli­cants must demon­strate job search or train­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said the mea­sures would be funded by the re­al­lo­ca­tion of monies from other ar­eas, such as de­vel­op­ment ex­pen­di­tures that were de­layed due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Last month, he up­dated Par­lia­ment that he would table the third Sup­ple­men­tary Sup­ply Bill to set out de­tails of pro­vi­sions to meet ad­di­tional spend­ing on th­ese mea­sures, which would then be de­bated by MPs. This Bill will go through the usual par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings and has to be as­sented to by the Pres­i­dent, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng will de­liver his min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment at 1.30pm on Mon­day, the Min­istry of Fi­nance said. The state­ment will be pub­lished on the Sin­ga­pore Bud­get web­site www.sin­ga­pore­bud­get.gov.sg af­ter de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>MAK­ING HEAD­WAY, STAY­ING CAU­TIOUS</p>
    <p>Our col­lec­tive ef­forts as a na­tion have paid off so far. We are now seeing low com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion, but we must re­main vig­i­lant. We are pro­gres­sively re­open­ing our econ­omy in a safe man­ner. But there is much un­cer­tainty ahead and many peo­ple are un­der­stand­ably anx­ious about their jobs.</p>
    <p>DEPUTY PRIME MIN­IS­TER HENG SWEE KEAT, in a Face­book post yes­ter­day on Sin­ga­pore’s bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion must be strength­ened to en­sure af­ford­able, fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines for all, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat at a high-level United Na­tions meet­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In a pre-recorded video message, Mr Heng added that Sin­ga­pore sup­ports vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and the role of the UN, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) and in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions in the fight against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery coun­try is do­ing its best to con­tain the spread of the virus, he said, and to cushion the im­pact of the pan­demic on busi­nesses, work­ers and house­holds.</p>
    <p>“But no place can truly be safe, un­til ev­ery place is safe. Coun­tries must there­fore work to­gether to fight this pan­demic. This is our only way to over­come the cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>The vir­tual event, ti­tled “Ac­cel­er­at­ing the end of the Covid-19 pan­demic: tak­ing new so­lu­tions to scale and mak­ing them eq­ui­tably ac­ces­si­ble to save lives, pro­tect health sys­tems and restart the global econ­omy”, was streamed live on­line, as most UN meet­ings have been due to global travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>It was hosted by the WHO, the United King­dom, South Africa and the UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral, and aims to build stronger po­lit­i­cal con­sen­sus for a co­or­di­nated global re­sponse to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, was re­it­er­at­ing Sin­ga­pore’s call for in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion as the world crossed the grim miles­tone of one mil­lion deaths caused by the coro­n­avirus ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>In his speech, he said that the 75th an­niver­sary of the UN this year marked an ex­traor­di­nary year, with Covid-19 turn­ing into a global pan­demic rag­ing across many parts of the world, and un­der­lin­ing the need for coun­tries to work to­gether.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is an early sup­porter of var­i­ous forms of mul­ti­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion. Th­ese in­clude the Ac­cess to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Ac­cel­er­a­tor, a global col­lab­o­ra­tion to ac­cel­er­ate de­vel­op­ment, pro­duc­tion and eq­ui­table ac­cess to Covid-19 tests, treat­ments and vac­cines that was launched in April.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also co-chairs the Friends of the Co­vax Facil­ity with Switzer­land, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“We also look for­ward to rep­re­sent­ing the Fo­rum of Small States, and work­ing with friends and part­ners on the ACT-Ac­cel­er­a­tor Fa­cil­i­ta­tion Coun­cil,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age more coun­tries to join th­ese ef­forts and sup­port vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism to bet­ter fight Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said that the world was at a turn­ing point, and ac­tions in the com­ing years will de­ter­mine the fu­ture of coun­tries and hu­man­ity. “Our col­lec­tive ef­fort will en­able us to over­come this cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>JOINT EF­FORT NEEDED</p>
    <p>No place can truly be safe, un­til ev­ery place is safe. Coun­tries must there­fore work to­gether to fight this pan­demic. This is our only way to over­come the cri­sis.</p>
