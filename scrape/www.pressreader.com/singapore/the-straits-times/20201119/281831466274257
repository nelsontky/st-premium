    <p>The Sec­re­tary of the United States Navy has called for the navy to es­tab­lish a new fleet at the in­ter­sec­tion of the In­dian and Pa­cific Oceans.</p>
    <p>“We can’t just rely on the Sev­enth Fleet in Ja­pan,” Mr Ken­neth Braith­waite said on Tues­day. He was speak­ing at the Naval Sub­ma­rine League’s an­nual sym­po­sium, which was held vir­tu­ally this year.</p>
    <p>His re­marks were re­ported in USNI News, the jour­nal of the US Naval In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>“We want to stand up a new num­bered fleet,” he said. “And we want to put that num­bered fleet in the cross­roads be­tween the In­dian and the Pa­cific Oceans, and we’re re­ally go­ing to have an Indo-Pacom foot­print.”</p>
    <p>In 2018, the United States Pa­cific Com­mand (USPa­com) changed its name to Indo-Pa­cific Com­mand or Indo-Pacom (USIn­dopa­com).</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the US Navy’s Sev­enth Fleet, op­er­at­ing out of Ja­pan, cov­ers a vast oceanic ex­panse, all the way to the In­dia-Pak­istan bor­der. An ad­di­tional fleet in the area would have ob­vi­ous mer­its, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>The plan also comes as the US Navy em­barks on an ag­gres­sive ex­pan­sion of its ship and sub­ma­rine strength over a 30-year hori­zon.</p>
    <p>“We have to look to our other al­lies and part­ners like Sin­ga­pore, like In­dia, and ac­tu­ally put a num­bered fleet where it would be ex­tremely rel­e­vant if, God for­bid, we were to ever get in any kind of a dust-up,” Mr Braith­waite said.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, it can pro­vide a much more for­mi­da­ble de­ter­rence.</p>
    <p>“So we’re go­ing to cre­ate the First Fleet. And we’re go­ing to put it, if not Sin­ga­pore right out of the chocks, we’re go­ing to look to make it more ex­pe­di­tionary-ori­ented and move it across the Pa­cific un­til it is where our al­lies and part­ners see that it could best as­sist them as well as to as­sist us.”</p>
    <p>Na­tions around the Pa­cific and around the globe need to as­sist in push­ing back Bei­jing mil­i­tar­ily and eco­nom­i­cally for de­ter­rence to work, he stressed.</p>
    <p>In a brief state­ment, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of De­fence said that – as per its 2012 agree­ment with the US – it had agreed to the US’ re­quest to de­ploy up to four lit­toral com­bat ships to Sin­ga­pore on a ro­ta­tional ba­sis. “This re­mains the stand­ing ar­range­ment with no fur­ther re­quests from or dis­cus­sions with the US Depart­ment of De­fence on ad­di­tional de­ploy­ment of US ships in Sin­ga­pore,” it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Braith­waite, who was ap­pointed by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in March and took of­fice in May, said he would be trav­el­ling to In­dia in the com­ing weeks to dis­cuss se­cu­rity chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>His re­marks came as the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group on Tues­day joined phase two of the an­nual Mal­abar naval ex­er­cises in the northern Ara­bian Sea along­side the navies of Aus­tralia, In­dia and Ja­pan – who to­gether com­prise the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>After clashes with China on its Hi­malayan bor­der, In­dia has drawn closer to the US and has suc­cess­fully con­cluded their fourth foun­da­tional mil­i­tary agree­ment. The lat­est Ba­sic Ex­change and Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment was signed last month.</p>
    <p>“There was a time when In­dia was con­cerned about the US pres­ence in the In­dian Ocean,” said re­tired naval com­modore C. Uday Bhaskar, di­rec­tor of the So­ci­ety for Pol­icy Stud­ies, an in­de­pen­dent think-tank in New Delhi. “How­ever, given the cur­rent level of mil­i­tary co­op­er­a­tion and the strate­gic part­ner­ship be­tween the US and In­dia, there would not be a sim­i­lar ap­pre­hen­sion.”</p>
    <p>The US move sends to its al­lies the mes­sage that “we are stay­ing, and not just via words but ac­tions” said Dr Aparna Pande, re­search fel­low and di­rec­tor of the Ini­tia­tive on the Fu­ture of In­dia and South Asia at the Hud­son In­sti­tute in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Mr Derek Gross­man, a se­nior de­fence an­a­lyst at Rand who fo­cuses on na­tional se­cu­rity pol­icy and the Indo-Pa­cific, tweeted that the US Navy plans to “dou­ble down on the ‘Indo’ part of the Indo-Pa­cific”.</p>
    <p>“If the US Navy goes ahead… it will reaf­firm that Wash­ing­ton con­tin­ues to view Asia strat­egy through an ‘Indo-Pa­cific’ lens, that is, not just fo­cus­ing on the Western Pa­cific,” Mr Gross­man told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“The US likely seeks to lever­age the In­dian Ocean Re­gion as part of a strat­egy to com­pete with and counter China, and, im­por­tantly, In­dia is in­creas­ingly favourable to­wards such an ap­proach.”</p>
