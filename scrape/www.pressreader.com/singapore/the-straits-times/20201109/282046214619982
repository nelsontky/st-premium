    <p>When Mr Ong Guan started work­ing as a PUB tech­ni­cian in 1976, he made for an odd sight – with a de­vice that looked like a stetho­scope in his ears, the other end con­nected to two metal discs on the ground.</p>
    <p>That was par for the course at the time, as the equip­ment he was us­ing – known as geo­phones – was nec­es­sary to pin­point the po­si­tion of leaks in un­der­ground wa­ter pipes.</p>
    <p>Trained tech­ni­cians would first press a metal stick with a disc on one end, called a lis­ten­ing stick, against pipe valves to lis­ten for faint noises gen­er­ated by wa­ter es­cap­ing from the pres­surised pipes.</p>
    <p>If they heard an ab­nor­mal noise, they would then put on the geo­phones and slowly walk along the length of ground above the pipes, try­ing to lis­ten for where the sound was loud­est.</p>
    <p>But the equip­ment would also pick up noises such as that of pass­ing cars and am­bi­ent sounds. So tech­ni­cians would have to stand still and tune out the other sounds in their head, fo­cus­ing only on the faint noise of un­der­ground wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“Some­times my boss would tell me: ‘Can you go and (check</p>
    <p>GREAT IM­PROVE­MENT</p>
    <p>Now, with the (tech­nol­ogy), we’re able to an­a­lyse more ac­cu­rately... You just need to key in some­thing and it’ll tell you where the next (leak) spot is.’’</p>

    <p>the pipes) at 2am?’ Be­cause it would be too noisy be­fore then,” Mr Ong said last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Now an en­gi­neer at PUB, the 66-year-old re­called it be­ing an ex­tremely te­dious and time-consuming process that re­lied on trial and er­ror and took a lot of man­power.</p>
    <p>But things have i mproved greatly since. Said Mr Ong: “Now, with the (tech­nol­ogy), we’re able to an­a­lyse more ac­cu­rately... You just need to key in some­thing and it’ll tell you where the next (leak) spot is.” Ti­mothy Goh</p>
