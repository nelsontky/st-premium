    <p>The global num­ber of coronaviru­s cases crossed 16 mil­lion yes­ter­day, surg­ing by one mil­lion new cases in just four days. More than half of the cases are in the Amer­i­cas and the Caribbean. Cases in Sin­ga­pore, mean­while, crossed the 50,000 mark yes­ter­day with 481 new cases an­nounced.</p>
    <p>PARIS • The num­ber of coronaviru­s cases world­wide crossed 16 mil­lion yes­ter­day, surg­ing by one mil­lion new cases in just four days. More than half of the cases are in the Amer­i­cas and the Caribbean, ac­cord­ing to an Agence France-Presse tally from of­fi­cial sources.</p>
    <p>Cases in Sin­ga­pore, mean­while, crossed the 50,000 mark yes­ter­day, with 481 new cases an­nounced.</p>
    <p>About 94 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s 50,369 pa­tients are mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health on Satur­day said it ex­pects the daily case counts to be high for the com­ing two weeks be­fore ta­per­ing, as the in­ter-agency task force tar­gets to clear all dor­mi­to­ries by the be­gin­ning of next month.</p>
    <p>The more than 16 mil­lion global cases in­clude over 649,000 fa­tal­i­ties, with the United States the worst-hit coun­try. The US has reg­is­tered more than 4.3 mil­lion in­fec­tions and over 149,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Florida yes­ter­day be­came the sec­ond state af­ter Cal­i­for­nia to over­take New York. To­tal Covid-19 cases in the Sun­shine State rose by 9,300 to over 423,000, just one place be­hind Cal­i­for­nia, which now leads the coun­try with more than 448,000 cases. New York is in third place with nearly 416,000 cases.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, mean­while, had its dead­li­est day yes­ter­day since the pan­demic be­gan, with the au­thor­i­ties re­port­ing 10 fa­tal­i­ties and a rise in new in­fec­tions, de­spite an in­ten­sive lock­down ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean have recorded some 4.3 mil­lion cases and over 182,000 deaths, fol­lowed by Europe with more than three mil­lion cases and over 207,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>The spread of the pan­demic con­tin­ues to ac­cel­er­ate and more than five mil­lion cases have been de­clared this month, which rep­re­sent a third of the to­tal num­ber of cases since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) says more than a mil­lion cases were recorded in each of the last five weeks, with over 280,000 re­ported last Fri­day alone.</p>
    <p>The coun­try with the high­est num­ber of deaths com­pared with its pop­u­la­tion is Bel­gium, with 85 fa­tal­i­ties per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants, fol­lowed by Bri­tain with 67, and Spain with 61.</p>
    <p>The spi­ralling num­bers are par­tic­u­larly wor­ry­ing be­cause the tal­lies, us­ing data col­lected by Agence France-Presse from na­tional au­thor­i­ties and in­for­ma­tion from the WHO, prob­a­bly re­flect only a frac­tion of the ac­tual num­ber of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries are test­ing only symp­to­matic or the most se­ri­ous cases, while oth­ers still have lim­ited test­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
