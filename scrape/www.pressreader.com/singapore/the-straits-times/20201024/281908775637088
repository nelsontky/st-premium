    <p>By the stan­dards of the first shout­ing match, the se­cond and last pres­i­den­tial de­bate of the cam­paign in Nashville, Ten­nessee, on Thurs­day night was al­most bor­ing.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, it was spir­ited, and there were per­sonal barbs. But it was more fo­cused and more dis­ci­plined.</p>
    <p>But the fact is, there is a lot of re­search that shows pres­i­den­tial de­bates do not re­ally mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Thurs­day’s de­bate is un­likely to prove an ex­cep­tion in a po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural en­vi­ron­ment so hard­ened that it is dif­fi­cult to imag­ine even in­de­pen­dent vot­ers mak­ing up their minds, or chang­ing them, in elec­torally sig­nif­i­cant num­bers on the ba­sis of one de­bate.</p>
    <p>A part of the rea­son for that may be that the po­si­tions, and the dif­fer­ences, of the can­di­dates are well known and am­pli­fied dur­ing a pres­i­den­tial cam­paign through weeks of tele­vi­sion ad­ver­tis­ing, in­ter­views, town halls and cam­paign ral­lies.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign con­tin­ues re­gard­less and Thurs­day’s de­bate will very soon be wa­ter un­der the bridge.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, Repub­li­can nom­i­nee and sit­ting Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his Demo­cratic Party chal­lenger, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, both gave each other room to ar­gue is­sues.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump vis­i­bly held his usual in­ter­rup­tions in check, and en­gaged on is­sues. Mr Bi­den seemed in dan­ger of in­co­her­ence at a cou­ple of points but nev­er­the­less did well, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>Much of the 96 min­utes ended up in rea­son­ably ro­bust but po­lite and, in gen­eral, in­con­clu­sive cir­cu­lar ar­gu­ments – for in­stance over the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
