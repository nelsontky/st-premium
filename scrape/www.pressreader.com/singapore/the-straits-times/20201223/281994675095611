    <p>The Health Pro­mo­tion Board or­gan­ises var­i­ous free sports and health-re­lated events around Sin­ga­pore, which par­tic­i­pants can sign up for through the Healthy 365 app.</p>
    <p>My fam­ily mem­bers and I have ben­e­fited greatly from these events since 2018. They have ranged from work­out ses­sions for adults, to dif­fer­ent sports and skills for chil­dren to learn. We were thus re­ally ex­cited when these ac­tiv­i­ties re­sumed re­cently.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stand­ably more dif­fi­cult to make book­ings due to the lim­ited slots avail­able.</p>
    <p>How­ever, what dis­ap­points and frus­trates me is when par­tic­i­pants book slots but fail to show up.</p>
    <p>Ac­tive Fam­ily @ Yishun Town Square of­fers weekly skate­board­ing les­sons that are usu­ally fully booked. Last Satur­day, only five out of 20 reg­is­tered par­tic­i­pants turned up for the ses­sion. The or­gan­is­ers had en­sured that there were suf­fi­cient coaches, re­sources and equip­ment for 20 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Due to the un­der­stand­ably strict pro­to­cols, the or­gan­is­ers could not al­low walk-ins de­spite the 15 no-shows. Thus, I had to dis­ap­point my two other chil­dren, who had to sit out this ac­tiv­ity as I had man­aged to book only one slot.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the or­gan­is­ers that were there, the at­ten­dance is of­ten low de­spite the high reg­is­tra­tion rate.</p>
    <p>I would ap­pre­ci­ate it if the or­gan­is­ers could re­view the sit­u­a­tion. So­lu­tions could in­clude a penalty for re­peated no-shows with­out a valid rea­son, re­leas­ing the slot if a per­son does not show up within 15 min­utes of the event start­ing and a wait-list sys­tem.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, I sin­cerely ap­peal to all par­tic­i­pants to be re­spon­si­ble and can­cel book­ings that they are not go­ing to ful­fil, so that their slots can be freed up for oth­ers. As long as the can­cel­la­tion is done be­fore the start of the event, oth­ers can still reg­is­ter.</p>
    <p>There are those who are look­ing for­ward to at­tend­ing these ses­sions. Although these events are free for par­tic­i­pants, time and money have been spent to pre­pare and run them. Let us be more mind­ful, re­spon­si­ble and ap­pre­cia­tive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, what dis­ap­points and frus­trates me is when par­tic­i­pants book slots but fail to show up.</p>
