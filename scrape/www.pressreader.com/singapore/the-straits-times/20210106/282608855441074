    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Hours af­ter an­nounc­ing the death of ac­tress Tanya Roberts – known for star­ring op­po­site Roger Moore in his fi­nal turn as James Bond as well as for her roles in Char­lie’s An­gels and That ’70s Show – her pub­li­cist said on Mon­day that he had done so in er­ror.</p>
    <p>The pub­li­cist Mike Pin­gel said in an in­ter­view on Mon­day night that Roberts, 65, was hos­pi­talised at Cedars-Si­nai Med­i­cal Cen­tre in</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les and in grave con­di­tion over an un­spec­i­fied ill­ness.</p>
    <p>The in­for­ma­tion con­tra­dicted ear­lier ac­counts he had given to sev­eral media out­lets that had re­ported she had died.</p>
    <p>Mr Pin­gel said he had re­lied on in­for­ma­tion from Mr Lance O’Brien, whom he iden­ti­fied as her hus­band.</p>
    <p>“It’s mis­com­mu­ni­ca­tion, un­for­tu­nately,” he added. “Peo­ple have been writ­ing beau­ti­ful, amaz­ing sto­ries on her. It’s a shame this hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>He de­clined to dis­cuss de­tails of her med­i­cal con­di­tion, which he said is not re­lated to Covid-19. But he told As­so­ci­ated Press that she had col­lapsed at her home late last month.</p>
    <p>Among the media or­gan­i­sa­tions that had re­ported Roberts was dead based on in­for­ma­tion from her pub­li­cist were As­so­ci­ated Press, USA To­day, the web­site</p>
    <p>TMZ and The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter.</p>
    <p>Roberts, who was born in the Bronx, New York City, scored her first big break as an ac­tress in 1980, play­ing a de­tec­tive on the fi­nal sea­son of TV se­ries Char­lie’s An­gels.</p>
    <p>Her big­gest suc­cess on the big screen came in 1985, when, de­spite be­ing 28 years younger than the lead­ing man of the Bond fran­chise, she starred op­po­site Moore in A View To A Kill.</p>
    <p>It was the fi­nal ap­pear­ance of Moore as the Bri­tish spy, one that he later crit­i­cised for the age gap be­tween him­self and Roberts, who is known for her breathy voice.</p>
    <p>From 1998 to 2004, she in­tro­duced her­self to a new gen­er­a­tion of TV view­ers with her re­cur­ring role as Midge Pin­ciotti on That ’70s Show.</p>
    <p>The re­port­ing of her death prompted a se­ries of trib­utes on so­cial media, in­clud­ing from fans of the Bond fran­chise.</p>
    <p>Her name un­ex­pect­edly and er­ro­neously joined those of re­cently lost stars as­so­ci­ated with the fran­chise, in­clud­ing Sean Con­nery, the dash­ing Scot who first played Ian Flem­ing’s se­cret ser­vice agent and died last Oc­to­ber. Bri­tish ac­tress Diana Rigg, whose char­ac­ter mar­ried Bond in On Her Majesty’s Se­cret Ser­vice (1969) and was killed on their wed­ding day, died last Septem­ber.</p>
