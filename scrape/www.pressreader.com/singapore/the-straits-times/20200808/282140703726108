    <p>A lorry driver was speed­ing home, af­ter a drink­ing ses­sion on Feb 21 last year, when he hit an el­derly news­pa­per ven­dor rid­ing a mo­tor­cy­cle, killing him.</p>
    <p>In­stead of stop­ping, Muham­mad Amin Mohamed Noor drove straight home, went to bed and tried to cover his tracks later that day by telling his em­ployer that the lorry had struck a lamp post. The dam­aged ve­hi­cle was sent to a work­shop for re­pairs.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, an in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer had to spend more time track­ing down the ve­hi­cle, said prosecutor­s.</p>
    <p>Amin, 29, a Sin­ga­porean, was sen­tenced to two years’ jail yes­ter­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to of­fences that in­clude caus­ing a death by rash driv­ing, fail­ing to stop af­ter the ac­ci­dent and ob­struct­ing the course of jus­tice. He was also dis­qual­i­fied from driv­ing all classes of ve­hi­cles for 10 years.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prosecutor­s Ken­neth Kee and Sean Koh said he had re­ported to work as a de­liv­ery driver around 8am on Feb 20 last year.</p>
    <p>He left at around 10pm and drove his lorry to Yishun Dam to meet a friend for a drink­ing ses­sion. He had his last drink at around 5am be­fore driv­ing his friend, who lives in Yishun, home.</p>
    <p>Amin was feeling tipsy as he drove along Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 1 to­wards Up­per Thom­son Road at about 6am. He was driv­ing at speeds of up to 100kmh when the limit was 60kmh.</p>
    <p>The lorry struck the rear of Mr Ho Swee Hai’s mo­tor­cy­cle without slow­ing down.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho, 70, was flung off his bike and landed on the road, mo­tion­less. Though Amin knew his lorry struck Mr Ho, he did not stop im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>A passer-by alerted the po­lice and paramedics pro­nounced Mr Ho dead at the scene.</p>
    <p>The DPPs said Amin con­tin­ued driv­ing along Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 1, stop­ping later at the side of the road for about five min­utes to com­pose him­self be­fore driv­ing home.</p>
    <p>The prosecutor­s said that, ow­ing to his lies, the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer was able to iden­tify the lorry and Amin’s iden­tity only at 6.10pm that day. The lorry was re­cov­ered at the work­shop about 20 min­utes later.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho used to de­liver news­pa­pers for me­dia com­pany Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH), which prints The Straits Times and other pa­pers. SPH chief cir­cu­la­tion of­fi­cer Chua Wee Phong said Mr Ho “de­voted more than 50 years of his life dis­tribut­ing our news­pa­pers to our readers”.</p>
