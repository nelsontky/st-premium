    <p>It was the most an­tic­i­pated show of the sea­son: Mi­uc­cia Prada and Raf Si­mons’ first joint col­lec­tion at the for­mer’s name­sake la­bel.</p>
    <p>The team-up was an un­prece­dented move in the in­dus­try and no one knew quite what to ex­pect.</p>
    <p>What the pair did was pare the brand down to its purest codes – very much in line with Si­mons’ pen­chant for get­ting to the core essence of a house he has just joined.</p>
    <p>There were spe­cific looks and items packed with Prada-ness: the house­coat, the slim knit with the full pleated skirt (left), the sub­ver­sively de­mure kit­ten heels, the ny­lon back­pack, the py­jama suit and, most im­por­tantly, the idea of a uni­form.</p>
    <p>But there was also plenty of Si­mons-ness – un­der­scor­ing just how in sync the pair’s thought pro­cesses have al­ways been.</p>
    <p>The long, lean sil­hou­ette of shell tops and tu­nics worn over trousers that opened the show was both a Si­mons sig­na­ture and a Prada main­stay.</p>
    <p>The co­coon coats, clutched close at the bo­som, were a ro­man­tic ges­ture both de­sign­ers have em­ployed to great ef­fect. Other Si­mons-isms abounded – most no­tably, the fit­ted, branded polo-necks with holes cut out that were lay­ered un­der most of the looks; and the Peter de Pot­ter graphics that ap­peared through­out, even over­laid on some of Prada’s most iconic ugly-chic prints from the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther man­i­fes­ta­tions of the duo’s shared de­sign lan­guage in­cluded the wrap, a key mo­tif in the col­lec­tion. Through this seem­ingly sim­ple de­sign, they ex­plored the dif­fer­ent mean­ings clothes can take on.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion was a highly ef­fec­tive ex­er­cise in sketch­ing out the po­ten­tial shapes that this on­go­ing col­lab­o­ra­tion might take.</p>
