    <p>The theme of the Sin­ga­porean core in the work­force con­tin­ued to dom­i­nate dis­cus­sion in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, with the fo­cus turn­ing to white-col­lar jobs and in­vok­ing an emo­tional re­sponse from Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo.</p>
    <p>Once again, the is­sue boiled down to whether enough such jobs – es­pe­cially in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor – were go­ing to Sin­ga­pore­ans, and whether Sin­ga­pore would suf­fer any back­lash by lim­it­ing the num­ber of for­eign­ers in se­nior po­si­tions in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo, who teared up at one point dur­ing her speech, said quo­tas for Em­ploy­ment Passes (EPs) were not ad­vis­able.</p>
    <p>It was a highly charged is­sue, in which statis­tics and logic could not ad­dress all of the griev­ances borne out of ex­pe­ri­ences on the ground.</p>
    <p>As the de­bate into the Pres­i­dent’s</p>
    <p>Ad­dress con­tin­ued into its se­cond day, the House heard that for every EP or S Pass given out in the last five years, about four more lo­cals, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs), took up jobs in­volv­ing pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians. Mean­while, the pop­u­la­tion of PRs re­mained sta­ble at about 500,000, and many of them were spouses of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>De­spite the num­bers show­ing that the sit­u­a­tion was un­der con­trol, there was no lack of ex­am­ples from MPs of res­i­dents who found them­selves sur­rounded by for­eign­ers in multi­na­tional com­pa­nies, or who were passed over for job op­por­tu­ni­ties de­spite hav­ing rel­e­vant work ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>They urged the Govern­ment to tamp down for­eign com­pe­ti­tion for these po­si­tions, prof­fer­ing sug­ges­tions rang­ing from quo­tas for work passes to im­pos­ing a time­line for tal­ent trans­fer.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said im­pos­ing quo­tas on EPs would be un­wise and it would be bet­ter to use salary re­quire­ments to en­sure that com­pa­nies can ac­cess for­eign pro­fes­sion­als of the right qual­ity, while com­mit­ting to build­ing up their lo­cal staff over time.</p>
    <p>“With­out such flex­i­bil­ity, many of the top-qual­ity in­vest­ments would have been lost to our com­peti­tors, and the job op­por­tu­ni­ties along with them,” she said.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor in par­tic­u­lar came un­der scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures re­leased re­cently by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, and cited yes­ter­day by Min­is­ter for Trans­port Ong Ye Kung, showed that 44 per cent of se­nior roles in the sec­tor are filled by Sin­ga­pore­ans, spark­ing ques­tions about whether this was good enough.</p>
    <p>Of the rest of the peo­ple in these roles, 20 per cent are PRs, and 36 per cent are for­eign­ers who hold work passes.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, who was speak­ing in his ca­pac­ity as board mem­ber of the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, said the num­ber should not be in­ter­preted as Sin­ga­pore­ans get­ting the short end of the stick, as the ab­so­lute num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans in se­nior roles had grown from 1,700 to 2,600 in the past five years though the pro­por­tion had re­mained largely the same.</p>
    <p>He also said that when fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions bring their func­tions to Sin­ga­pore, Sin­ga­pore­ans gain global and re­gional ex­per­tise which pre­pares them for sim­i­lar roles over­seas in global firms.</p>
    <p>Even then, MPs won­dered if there were gaps in the ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing sys­tems that needed to be plugged so that more Sin­ga­pore­ans can take on these roles.</p>
    <p>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPher­son) said that it would be more mean­ing­ful to have em­ploy­ers hir­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans out of pref­er­ence, and not just out of obli­ga­tion to keep within the laws.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said that many Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­stood the in­ter­na­tional char­ac­ter of the Repub­lic’s fi­nan­cial cen­tre. “But (they) want to see Sin­ga­pore­ans do bet­ter, with greater as­sur­ance of fair hir­ing prac­tices that put them on a level play­ing field. These are valid con­cerns,” he added.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the in­crease in the min­i­mum salary to qual­ify for EPs, and the var­i­ous govern­ment schemes to re­ward com­pa­nies that hire Sin­ga­pore­ans, as well as pro­grammes to train Sin­ga­pore­ans for top jobs, Mrs Teo also said: “We must there­fore not miss the wood for the trees, by fo­cus­ing nar­rowly on keep­ing for­eign­ers out, and miss­ing the larger pic­ture of grow­ing the pie and giv­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans the chance of the best slice.”</p>
    <p>But she stressed that each and every in­stance of dis­crim­i­na­tion erodes trust in the sys­tem, and called on em­ploy­ers to be fair to Sin­ga­pore­ans when hir­ing or re­trench­ing.</p>
    <p>“What we lose then is not just a job op­por­tu­nity for a lo­cal, but the trust that the sys­tem is fair, that the odds were not stacked against peo­ple who are try­ing,” she added.</p>
    <p>Both min­is­ters ac­knowl­edged that the statis­tics were not al­ways con­gru­ent with ex­pe­ri­ences on the ground, and pledged that the Govern­ment would do its best to pro­tect work­ers.</p>
    <p>Tear­ing up as she ad­dressed work­ers di­rectly in her speech, Mrs Teo said: “We know that in your hearts, you care most about the well-be­ing of your fam­i­lies and loved ones. You want to do well not just for your­self, but for them.</p>
    <p>“Please know that you too are al­ways in our hearts,” she said, pledg­ing that the min­istry will jour­ney with them no mat­ter how long the cri­sis lasts.</p>
    <p>“How­ever tough it may be, we will help you bounce back. Our mis­sion is to help each one of you emerge stronger, by never giv­ing up hope, and by work­ing with em­ploy­ers in Sin­ga­pore to treat you fairly, to make your hard work bear fruit.”</p>
