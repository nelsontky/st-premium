    <p>As we ap­proach the end of this ex­tra­or­di­nary pan­demic year, many peo­ple’s eval­u­a­tion of the past 12 months will be suf­fused by all they may have lost, en­dured or been de­nied. Yet, there can be few of us who have not ab­sorbed new learn­ings or dis­cov­ered new depths within our­selves.</p>
    <p>For most of us, this year has clar­i­fied how much more im­por­tant emo­tional con­nec­tions are in our lives than ma­te­rial things.</p>
    <p>Un­der the shadow of Covid-19, peo­ple ev­ery­where have recog­nised afresh our same­ness and one­ness, and found life the fuller for this shift in our­selves.</p>
    <p>One of the most touch­ing and re­mark­able in­ci­dences of con­nect­ing with our com­mon hu­man­ity was seen in World War I, in the face of death.</p>
    <p>In those far-off days, war­fare was of the old-fash­ioned kind, where men con­fronted each other with guns and in­fantry ad­vances. Stretched across Europe in the freez­ing cold, French, Ger­man, Rus­sian and Bri­tish troops lined up in trenches op­po­site each other with or­ders to kill. A nar­row strip of no-man’s land lay be­tween their re­spec­tive trenches.</p>
    <p>To­wards the end of 1914, Pope Bene­dict XV sug­gested a truce over Christ­mas be­tween the</p>
    <p>war­ring sides. “Let the guns fall silent at least upon the night the an­gels sang,” he pleaded. This re­quest was re­fused by the op­pos­ing gov­ern­ments. The men in the trenches thought dif­fer­ently and, in quiet sec­tors along the Western Front, un­ob­tru­sively ini­ti­ated their own spon­ta­neous truces.</p>
    <p>Late on that Christ­mas Eve of 1914, sol­diers in the Bri­tish trenches heard the Ger­man sol­diers sing­ing Christ­mas carols. Look­ing over the top of their fox­hole, they saw lanterns and the branches of fir trees dec­o­rat­ing the Ger­man dugout.</p>
    <p>Christ­mas greet­ings were shouted be­tween trenches, and the Bri­tish too be­gan to sing carols. Even­tu­ally, men from both sides climbed out of their wet bunkers to greet each other in no-man’s land, ex­chang­ing small gifts of food and to­bacco, or sou­venirs of but­tons and hats.</p>
    <p>The prox­im­ity of the trenches made it easy for the sol­diers to com­mu­ni­cate and ar­range truces of their own. Even ear­lier than Christ­mas, a Ger­man sur­geon had recorded a spon­ta­neous truce each even­ing for both sides to re­cover bod­ies for burial. Hav­ing met, shaken hands and smoked to­gether, it was then dif­fi­cult to re­turn to the work of killing.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter pub­lished in the Daily Mail in 1915, one Bri­tish sol­dier, look­ing back on min­gling with the en­emy, wrote: “What an earth are we do­ing here fight­ing them… We can­not shoot them in cold blood… I can­not see how we can get them to re­turn to busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>This find­ing of a com­mon hu­man­ity was not to the lik­ing of su­pe­rior of­fi­cers on ei­ther side.</p>
    <p>Charles de Gaulle, a dec­o­rated of­fi­cer of World War 1 and later pres­i­dent of France, wrote of the “lam­en­ta­ble” de­sire of French in­fantry­men to leave the en­emy in peace. An­other com­man­der,</p>
    <p>Vic­tor d’Ur­bal, wrote of the “un­for­tu­nate con­se­quences” when men “be­come fa­mil­iar with their neigh­bours”.</p>
    <p>CON­NECT, NOT KILL</p>
    <p>At the close of 2020, in a world be­set with fear, rabid in­equal­ity and bru­tal discrimina­tion, it is up­lift­ing to know that left to their own de­vices, peo­ple will more read­ily con­nect than kill.</p>
    <p>The Christ­mas truce of 1914, more than 100 years ago this De­cem­ber, re­veals a time­less truth – that in­di­vid­u­als, even in the most ex­treme con­di­tions, can still find the courage to lis­ten to the voice of whole­ness within them­selves and re­ject the frag­men­ta­tion around them.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can au­thor and ed­u­ca­tor Parker Palmer, founder of the Cen­tre for Courage and Re­newal in South Carolina, seeks ways to cre­ate a more just and com­pas­sion­ate world. In his book, A Hid­den Whole­ness: The Jour­ney To­ward An Un­di­vided Life, he writes of what is pos­si­ble if we re­ject our stance of fear, the root of our di­vid­ed­ness.</p>
    <p>“Afraid that our in­ner light will be ex­tin­guished or our in­ner dark­ness ex­posed, we hide our true iden­ti­ties from each other. In the process, we be­come sep­a­rated from our own souls. We end up liv­ing di­vided lives, so far re­moved from the truth we hold within that we can­not know the in­tegrity that comes from be­ing what we are.”</p>
    <p>Whole­ness does not mean per­fec­tion, but em­brac­ing bro­ken­ness as an in­te­gral part of life.</p>
    <p>Bud­dhism recog­nises this truth in its ac­cep­tance of life’s tran­sience and im­per­fec­tion. Nowhere is this doc­trine bet­ter em­braced than in the Ja­panese aes­thetic of wabi-sabi, which ven­er­ates the patina of age upon ob­jects, the beauty of the flawed.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, when mend­ing bro­ken ceram­ics, the Ja­panese ag­gran­dised the dam­age by filling the cracks with gold. The suf­fer­ing of im­pair­ment, and the hon­esty of age and use, il­lu­mi­nate an ob­ject’s soul. The no­bil­ity of fail­ure is sim­i­larly em­braced in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The failed hero who pits him­self against the odds and loses is hon­oured as much as the con­quer­ing hero.</p>
    <p>STO­RIES OF COM­PAS­SION</p>
    <p>Our world is a dam­aged place at the mo­ment. Although our year of Covid-19 is end­ing, our pan­demic jour­ney is far from over. Our im­per­fec­tions are on view for all to see, yet the es­sen­tial in­tegrity of hu­man na­ture has also been re­vealed in mul­ti­ple sto­ries of com­pas­sion and al­tru­ism.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the ded­i­cated self­less­ness of health­care work­ers, neigh­bours are look­ing out for each other in a new way, spon­ta­neous peo­ple’s ini­tia­tives have sprung up world­wide to help those fac­ing hard­ship. In Sin­ga­pore, the kam­pung spirit has re­turned, and even small chil­dren are giv­ing their red pack­ets of money to those in need.</p>
    <p>Our mod­ern cul­ture stresses an outer knowl­edge that em­pow­ers us to op­er­ate ef­fec­tively in the world. Knowl­edge of our in­ner selves is less en­cour­aged.</p>
    <p>We are so of­ten filled with dis­sat­is­fac­tion and the need for more – ma­te­rial pos­ses­sions, so­cial sta­tus, plea­sure. Yet, con­scious­ness and choice are al­ways with us.</p>
    <p>This strange year has forced us all to look within and recog­nise anew the un­seen; feel­ings, in­tu­ition, emo­tions, val­ues, be­liefs, and our pur­pose in life. A name­less pres­ence within us all, so of­ten hid­den or for­got­ten by our ev­ery­day selves, pro­vides calm and re­silience in the face of ad­ver­sity, if we will but ac­knowl­edge it.</p>
    <p>On Christ­mas Eve of 1914, amid the dev­as­ta­tion of war and a spon­ta­neous cease­fire, men now lost to his­tory made the choice to look within and recog­nise their quin­tes­sen­tial na­ture.</p>
    <p>To­day, the de­struc­tion wrought by our mod­ern-day pan­demic of­fers that eter­nal choice to us once more. In Palmer’s words, em­brac­ing our bro­ken­ness gives hope that hu­man whole­ness need not be a utopian dream, if we can use dev­as­ta­tion as a seedbed for new life.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the kam­pung spirit has re­turned, and even small chil­dren are giv­ing their red pack­ets of money to those in need.</p>
