    <p>Ties be­tween the United States and Asia are set to im­prove un­der US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, ush­er­ing in a pe­riod of greater pre­dictabil­ity and sta­bil­ity for the re­gion, ac­cord­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s veteran diplo­mats Tommy Koh and Chan Heng Chee.</p>
    <p>They were speak­ing at The Straits Times’ we­bi­nar, Geopo­lit­i­cal Re­set 2021, part of a se­ries that aims to help read­ers make sense of what might lie ahead.</p>
    <p>Here are some ex­cerpts from Thurs­day’s we­bi­nar.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Chan Heng Chee: If you read every­thing that Bi­den has writ­ten or said, he hasn’t banged up China that much. There’s not much he can do, but he hasn’t added oil to the fire. So I think you will see some nu­anc­ing. I think the deci­bels will be toned down. And that’s plenty. The world is root­ing for that.</p>
    <p>Prof Chan:</p>
    <p>It was thought that be­cause the United States came out so strongly on the South China Sea, claimants like Malaysia, Viet­nam took a stronger stance... So I would say the United States will con­tinue with its vig­i­lance in the South China Sea, but will not be as provoca­tive as Pres­i­dent (Don­ald) Trump.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tommy Koh: Bi­den will el­e­vate, as (then Pres­i­dent Barack) Obama did, the im­por­tance of South-east Asia and Asean to US pol­icy. And I ex­pect ei­ther Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den or Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris to at­tend the an­nual Asean Sum­mit and re­lated sum­mit.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>WHAT DO YOU AN­TIC­I­PATE WILL BE THE BI­DEN AD­MIN­IS­TRA­TION’S TOP FOR­EIGN POL­ICY PRI­OR­I­TIES?</p>
    <p>DO YOU THINK BI­DEN’S TEAM WILL LIFT THE EX­IST­ING TRADE TAR­IFFS ON CHINA?</p>
    <p>Prof Koh: The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­peared to want to de­cou­ple the two economies. It would be ex­tremely painful to both sides and makes no eco­nomic sense. I ex­pect the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to stop this, to stop the at­tempt to de­cou­ple the two economies. There are trade prob­lems be­tween them for sure, but these can be set­tled bi­lat­er­ally through ne­go­ti­a­tion or through WTO (World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion). They need not be turned into a na­tional strate­gic is­sue.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>HOW WILL THE BI­DEN AD­MIN­IS­TRA­TION</p>
    <p>AP­PROACH THE TAI­WAN IS­SUE?</p>
    <p>Prof Chan: At one point, I thought, is the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion try­ing to pro­voke a con­flict over Tai­wan? It’s send­ing sec­re­taries, Cab­i­net sec­re­taries to Tai­wan. The pack­age that they are of­fer­ing – the arms pack­age – is more than any other ad­min­is­tra­tion would have of­fered. So are they pro­vok­ing China? I think that’s one place where you will find the deci­bels low­ered, the tem­per­a­ture low­ered.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>WHAT ABOUT HONG KONG?</p>
    <p>Prof Koh: There will be an im­passe. I think that ei­ther side has room to give way. For the Chi­nese, it’s a sovereignt­y is­sue. They have ev­ery right un­der their Con­sti­tu­tion (to in­tro­duce) this na­tional se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong. The Bri­tish said the Chi­nese have bro­ken their treaty com­mit­ment; the Chi­nese don’t agree. The US sees this as an op­pres­sion of democ­racy and hu­man rights in Hong Kong. So there’s an im­passe, they will never agree. On this, the best we can ex­pect is an agree­ment to dis­agree.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF U.S. AM­BI­TIONS TO EX­PORT DEMOC­RACY?</p>
    <p>Prof Chan: The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will want to em­pha­sise democ­racy, be­cause... Amer­ica has felt that democ­racy has been de­cay­ing in the last four years... But it’s not a good idea to sort of wave this flag of democ­racy in ev­ery­one’s face. Coun­tries have dif­fer­ent his­to­ries and tra­di­tions.</p>
