    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK The an­nounce­ment this week that a cheap, easy-tomake coronaviru­s vac­cine that ap­peared to be up to 90 per cent ef­fec­tive was greeted with ju­bi­la­tion.</p>
    <p>But since un­veil­ing the pre­lim­i­nary re­sults, As­traZeneca, which de­vel­oped the vac­cine with the Univer­sity of Ox­ford, has ac­knowl­edged a key mis­take in the vac­cine dosage re­ceived by some study par­tic­i­pants, adding to doubts whether the vac­cine’s ap­par­ently spec­tac­u­lar ef­fi­cacy will hold up in ad­di­tional test­ing.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists and in­dus­try ex­perts said the er­ror and a se­ries of other ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties and omis­sions in the way As­traZeneca ini­tially dis­closed the data have eroded their con­fi­dence in the re­li­a­bil­ity of the re­sults.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in the United States have noted that the re­sults were not clear.</p>
    <p>The head of the flag­ship fed­eral vac­cine ini­tia­tive sug­gested that the vac­cine’s most promis­ing re­sults may not have re­flected data from older peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The up­shot, the ex­perts said, is that the odds of reg­u­la­tors in the US and else­where quickly au­tho­ris­ing the emer­gency use of the As­traZeneca vac­cine are de­clin­ing, an un­ex­pected set­back i n the global cam­paign to cor­ral the dev­as­tat­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I think that they have re­ally dam­aged con­fi­dence in their whole de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme,” said Dr Ge­of­frey Porges, an an­a­lyst for in­vest­ment bank SVB Leerink.</p>
    <p>Ms Michele Meix­ell, a spokesman for As­traZeneca, said the tri­als “were con­ducted to the high­est stan­dards”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the er­ror in the dosage was dis­cov­ered, Bri­tish reg­u­la­tors signed off on the plan to con­tinue test­ing it in dif­fer­ent doses, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment that Ms Meix­ell at­trib­uted to Ox­ford.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view on Wed­nes­day, Mr Menelas Pan­ga­los, the As­traZeneca ex­ec­u­tive in charge of much of the firm’s re­search and de­vel­op­ment, de­fended the com­pany’s han­dling of the test­ing and its pub­lic dis­clo­sures.</p>
    <p>He said the er­ror in the dosage was made by a con­trac­tor, and that, once it was dis­cov­ered, reg­u­la­tors were im­me­di­ately no­ti­fied and signed off on the plan to con­tinue test­ing the vac­cine in dif­fer­ent doses.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca was the third com­pany this month to re­port en­cour­ag­ing early re­sults on a coronaviru­s vac­cine can­di­date. At first glance, the re­sults on Monday morn­ing looked promis­ing.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the strength at which the doses were given, the vac­cine ap­peared to be ei­ther 90 per cent or 62 per cent ef­fec­tive. The av­er­age ef­fi­cacy, the de­vel­op­ers said, was 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>Al­most im­me­di­ately, though, there were doubts about the data.</p>
    <p>The reg­i­men that ap­peared to be 90 per cent ef­fec­tive was based on par­tic­i­pants re­ceiv­ing a half dose of the vac­cine fol­lowed a month later by a full dose; the less ef­fec­tive ver­sion in­volved a pair of full doses.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca dis­closed in its ini­tial an­nounce­ment that fewer than 2,800 par­tic­i­pants re­ceived the smaller dos­ing reg­i­men, com­pared with nearly 8,900 par­tic­i­pants who re­ceived two full doses.</p>
    <p>The big­gest ques­tions were, why was there such a large vari­a­tion in the ef­fec­tive­ness of the vac­cine at dif­fer­ent doses, and why did a smaller dose ap­pear to pro­duce much bet­ter re­sults? As­traZeneca and Ox­ford re­searchers said they did not know.</p>
    <p>Cru­cial in­for­ma­tion was also miss­ing. The com­pany said the early anal­y­sis was based on 131 symp­to­matic Covid-19 cases that had turned up in study par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>But it did not break down how many cases were found in each group of par­tic­i­pants – those who re­ceived the half-strength ini­tial dose, the reg­u­lar-strength ini­tial dose and the placebo.</p>
    <p>The big­gest ques­tions were, why was there such a large vari­a­tion in the ef­fec­tive­ness of the vac­cine at dif­fer­ent doses, and why did a smaller dose ap­pear to pro­duce much bet­ter re­sults? As­traZeneca and Ox­ford re­searchers said they did not know.</p>
