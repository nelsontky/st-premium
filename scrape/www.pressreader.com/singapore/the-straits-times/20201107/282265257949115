    <p>Changes to the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Act (PDPA) were passed in Par­lia­ment this week (Up­date to data law seeks to re­tain trust, spur in­no­va­tion, Nov 3).</p>
    <p>En­acted in 2012, the Act, which gov­erns the col­lec­tion, use and dis­clo­sure of per­sonal data, pro­vided for the sub­se­quent es­tab­lish­ment of the Do Not Call (DNC) reg­istry, which lets peo­ple opt out of mar­ket­ing mes­sages ad­dressed to their Sin­ga­pore tele­phone num­bers.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ex­is­tence of the DNC reg­istry, many of us still re­ceive un­so­licited mes­sages from com­pa­nies ex­tend­ing un­se­cured short-term loans. Many of these mes­sages tar­get those with debts in­curred from gam­bling.</p>
    <p>The DNC reg­istry does not seem to have a mech­a­nism for easy re­port­ing of un­so­licited mes­sages. It does not seem ef­fec­tive in stop­ping such ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>A re­cent de­vel­op­ment is the un­so­licited and un­con­sented list­ing of med­i­cal clin­ics and doc­tors on web­sites and med­i­cal con­sul­ta­tion apps.</p>
    <p>These web­sites and apps re­pro­duce doc­tors’ in­for­ma­tion from of­fi­cial web­sites such as those of the Min­istry of Health and Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>One of their aims is to at­tract users to make an ap­point­ment to see a doc­tor. When the doc­tor cho­sen is not one who sub­scribes to their ser­vices, the user is redi­rected to an­other doc­tor who did pay the web­site.</p>
    <p>This is mis­lead­ing and not dif­fer­ent from those taxi touts at tourist spots side­track­ing un­sus­pect­ing tourists.</p>
    <p>Some of these web­sites are cre­ated and hosted by com­pa­nies over­seas, where lo­cal laws can­not be ap­plied.</p>
    <p>The changes to the PDPA should keep up with the times and tech­no­log­i­cal changes.</p>
    <p>First, there should be a mech­a­nism for easy sub­mis­sion of feed­back or com­plaints. It could be an app like those of the po­lice and the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the law should be amended to in­clude data be­long­ing to com­pa­nies and their staff. It cur­rently cov­ers only per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>Third, the world to­day is flat as a re­sult of in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy. Many fraud­sters and crim­i­nals can com­mit their deeds from abroad. In­no­va­tive ideas must be adopted to pros­e­cute these of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>The law must be pre-emp­tive and stay steps ahead of those who are tempted to fleece the in­no­cent.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ex­is­tence of the Do Not Call reg­istry, many of us still re­ceive un­so­licited mes­sages from com­pa­nies ex­tend­ing un­se­cured short-term loans.</p>
