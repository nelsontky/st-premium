    <p>COR­PUS CHRISTI • Al­ready bat­tered by the coronaviru­s pan­demic, south-east Texas faced a new but no less frightenin­g foe on Satur­day as Hur­ri­cane Hanna slammed the coast with heavy rain and pow­er­ful winds.</p>
    <p>Hanna strength­ened from a trop­i­cal storm to a Cat­e­gory 1 hur­ri­cane, be­com­ing the first hur­ri­cane to hit the south­ern coastal re­gion of Texas since Hur­ri­cane Har­vey struck the area in Au­gust 2017 and caused the worst rain­storm in US his­tory.</p>
    <p>Hanna’s eye made land­fall on Padre Is­land, about 96km north of the US-Mex­ico bor­der, at about 5pm on Satur­day, with winds of 145kmh.</p>
    <p>As the Na­tional Weather Ser­vice warned that the strong winds could peel roofs from homes, man­gle trees and cause power fail­ures, may­ors and lo­cal of­fi­cials turned from one crisis mode to another.</p>
    <p>The cities and coun­ties in the path of Hanna are some of the same com­mu­ni­ties that have seen a sud­den spike in Covid-19 cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions as Texas has be­come one of the largest hot spots in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In a state that is no stranger to bad weather, the typ­i­cal hur­ri­cane prepa­ra­tion rit­ual was al­tered by so­cial dis­tanc­ing and face cov­er­ings, with fever checks re­quired to en­ter of­fi­cials’ news brief­ings and sand­bag dis­tri­bu­tion pro­vided by work­ers who cov­ered their faces in masks and ban­dan­nas.</p>
    <p>Mr W. Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Di­vi­sion of Emer­gency Man­age­ment, said the Freeman Coli­seum in San An­to­nio would be con­verted into a re­cep­tion cen­tre for peo­ple who had fled their homes.</p>
    <p>Hanna was down­graded to a trop­i­cal storm yes­ter­day by the US Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre, but it was still pack­ing winds of around 115kmh.</p>
    <p>“Hanna is ex­pected to pro­duce heavy rain across por­tions of south­ern Texas and north-eastern Mex­ico. The rain will re­sult in lifethreat­en­ing flash flood­ing (and some river flood­ing),” me­te­o­rol­o­gists said ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hur­ri­cane Dou­glas was near­ing land­fall in Hawaii yes­ter­day and could bring deadly winds and rain to the is­lands, said the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>De­spite that, res­i­dents on Maui were char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally relaxed about the storm. “We are bring­ing in the lawn chairs and putting big rocks on some roofing ma­te­rial we just bought,” said Mr Chuck Bo­erner, a 74-year-old farmer from Ki­pahulu, in east Maui.</p>
    <p>Hawaii has a frac­tion of the tourists it would nor­mally have at this time of year be­cause of the coronaviru­s pan­demic, mak­ing things some­what eas­ier for emer­gency plan­ners.</p>
    <p>“If there are any pos­i­tives in this sit­u­a­tion, it is that there are fewer visitors to be ac­count­able for, fewer peo­ple to worry about,” said Mr Chris Sugi­dono, a public in­for­ma­tion of­fi­cer for Maui County.</p>
