    <p>Re­view­ing re­mand num­bers, track­ing re­mand cases and con­sid­er­ing moves to of­fer bail to more, in­stead of keep­ing ac­cused per­sons in re­mand.</p>
    <p>These are some con­cerns that a task force from the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) seeks to ad­dress, act­ing in con­cert with other agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The group is part of the In­ter­A­gency Re­mand Task Force on the Re­mand Pop­u­la­tion in Pris­ons – com­pris­ing the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA), the State Courts and the AGC – set up in April 2014 to mon­i­tor and man­age trends in the re­mand pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“The re­mand task force in AGC plays both an over­sight and ad­vi­sory role in re­mand mat­ters,” said an AGC spokesman last week in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>It works col­lec­tively with MHA and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force to mon­i­tor the over­all re­mand pop­u­la­tion reg­u­larly with a view to­wards re­duc­ing the num­ber.</p>
    <p>“The col­lec­tive ef­fort has seen var­i­ous ini­tia­tives which have kept the re­mand pop­u­la­tion in check,” added the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, the amend­ment to the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code (CPC) to al­low an ac­cused per­son to be re­leased on bail with e-tag­ging in 2018 has pro­vided an ex­tra tool to re­lease an ac­cused per­son in re­mand who can­not af­ford the usual bail. We have seen an in­crease in the num­ber of per­sons in re­mand who are re­leased on re­duced bail with e-tag­ging.”</p>
    <p>MHA fig­ures show there were 186 ac­cused per­sons placed on elec­tronic tag­ging with re­duced bail in lieu of re­mand be­tween Jan­uary and July this year. This out­stripped the to­tal of 72 ac­cused per­sons tagged with re­duced bail in lieu of re­mand last year. There were 19 such ac­cused per­sons in 2018.</p>
    <p>The rise in the num­ber of ac­cused per­sons who are re­leased on re­duced bail with e-tag­ging, as well as those placed on per­sonal bond, has helped keep the re­mand pop­u­la­tion in check, said the AGC spokesman.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, we will con­tinue work­ing with our stake­hold­ers to ex­plore other ways that will help us to do so more ef­fec­tively,” she added.</p>
    <p>Over­all, re­mand num­bers have stayed fairly con­stant in the last few years. As of Dec 31 last year, there were 1,135 re­man­dees, dip­ping from the 1,391 in 2018, and 1,343 in 2017.</p>
    <p>An MHA spokesman, who pro­vided the fig­ures, said the re­mand pe­riod varies based on sev­eral fac­tors, in­clud­ing the type and num­ber of charges, as well as whether the re­mandee has pleaded guilty or claimed trial.</p>
    <p>“In the majority of the cases, bail would con­tinue to re­main avail­able to them. When in re­mand, all due ju­di­cial pro­cesses will be al­lowed to take their course, so as to en­sure that each and ev­ery ac­cused per­son re­ceives a fair hear­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing fur­ther the role of the AGC task force, its spokesman said it had put in place var­i­ous mea­sures to mon­i­tor re­mand cases.</p>
    <p>“Re­mand cases are tracked reg­u­larly to en­sure that there are no un­due de­lays in the move­ment of the cases, es­pe­cially cases in­volv­ing of­fences which typ­i­cally at­tract fines or short cus­to­dial sen­tences.”</p>
    <p>In re­mand cases where more time is re­quired for dis­posal, as­sess­ments are made whether to of­fer re­duced bail with e-tag­ging, or per­sonal bond with­out the need for se­cu­rity to be fur­nished to en­able an ac­cused per­son to be re­leased from cus­tody un­til his case can be dis­posed of, she added.</p>
    <p>“We pri­ori­tise the dis­posal of re­mand cases so that an ac­cused per­son does not spend a longer time in cus­tody than is nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>Other roles of the AGC task force in­clude ex­er­cis­ing over­sight over the rel­e­vant prose­cut­ing agen­cies to en­sure that re­mand cases are dis­posed of ex­pe­di­tiously, and pro­vid­ing le­gal ad­vice to its stake­hold­ers where re­mand and bail-re­lated poli­cies are con­cerned.</p>
    <p>“There are cases where an ac­cused per­son may still not be able to pro­vide re­duced bail or per­sonal bond de­spite ef­forts from the pros­e­cu­tion or the courts,” she said.</p>
    <p>“In such cases, AGC will seek ur­gent trial dates so that the case can be heard ex­pe­di­tiously.</p>
    <p>“Any sen­tence of im­pris­on­ment is gen­er­ally back­dated to take ac­count of the re­mand pe­riod spent such that an ac­cused per­son is not</p>
    <p>COL­LEC­TIVE EF­FORT</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tive ef­fort has seen var­i­ous ini­tia­tives which have kept the re­mand pop­u­la­tion in check... we will con­tinue work­ing with our stake­hold­ers to ex­plore other ways that will help us ’’ to do so more ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>A SPOKESMAN FOR THE AT­TOR­NEY-GEN­ERAL’S CHAM­BERS</p>
    <p>prej­u­diced by the amount of time he spent in re­mand.”</p>
    <p>Lawyers wel­come the on-go­ing ef­forts to con­sider al­ter­na­tives to re­mand and the rise in the use of elec­tronic tag­ging in lieu of re­mand.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Crim­i­nal Lawyers Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Su­nil Sud­heesan, in sup­port­ing its prac­ti­cal use, said on prin­ci­ple the wear­ing of the tag might taint the ac­cused per­son as a crim­i­nal be­fore trial.</p>
    <p>“Al­though the le­gal frame­work for its use has been cast, one needs to re­view the philo­soph­i­cal ba­sis, whether it is sound to ex­pect a tag to be worn when go­ing about dayto-day work.”</p>
    <p>He called for pos­si­ble al­ter­na­tives from bet­ter use of up­dated tech­nol­ogy, such as the Zoom fa­cil­ity with GPS track­ing, as a reg­u­lar means for a bailee to re­port his move­ments.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Peter Ong Lip Cheng wel­comed the e-tag­ging de­vice but said it should be smaller and not vis­i­ble, point­ing to a client on bail with e-tag­ging as a con­di­tion. He had taken to wear­ing long pants only, both at home and out­doors, to hide the de­vice tagged to his an­kle.</p>
    <p>“At home, he has had to dis­card all his shorts and opt to wear long pants all the time be­cause he does not want his do­mes­tic maid to think he is a crim­i­nal,” he added.</p>
