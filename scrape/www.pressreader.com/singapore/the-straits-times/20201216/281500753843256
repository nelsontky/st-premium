    <p>The HSBC Women’s World Cham­pi­onship, one of Sin­ga­pore’s mar­quee sports events which was can­celled this year due to the coron­avirus pan­demic, looks set to re­turn next year af­ter its ti­tle spon­sor an­nounced on Mon­day it has re­newed its com­mit­ment to the tour­na­ment on a multi-year deal.</p>
    <p>The US$1.5 mil­lion (S$2 mil­lion) golf tour­na­ment was orig­i­nally sched­uled for Feb 27-March 1 this year at the Sen­tosa Golf Club (SGC) but was called off two weeks be­fore its planned start.</p>
    <p>Next year’s edi­tion is likely to be held in its usual Fe­bru­ary-March slot. It is part of the LPGA Tour’s early sea­son Asian Swing and fea­tures a world-class field with most of the top-10 play­ers and Ma­jor cham­pi­ons. Es­tab­lished in 2008, its last con­tract ex­ten­sion was from 2018 to this year.</p>
    <p>A tour­na­ment spokesman told The Straits Times yes­ter­day or­gan­is­ers are work­ing with the Govern­ment to de­velop health and safety pro­to­cols to en­sure the com­pe­ti­tion com­plies with guide­lines on the re­sump­tion of mass events.</p>
    <p>Over­seas play­ers and of­fi­cials will un­dergo Covid-19 tests be­fore and upon ar­rival here, the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers are hop­ing to al­low some fans into the SGC grounds though that num­ber is de­pen­dent on the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion then. Last year, the event at­tracted 32,000 fans over four days.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore pro­fes­sional Amanda Tan, 20, who played in last year’s edi­tion af­ter win­ning the re­gional qual­i­fy­ing event, said her last tour­na­ment was in Jan­uary in Tai­wan and was look­ing for­ward to the</p>
    <p>HSBC event.</p>
    <p>She added: “I do get wor­ried since a few coun­tries are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing sec­ond or even third waves now, but I know the or­gan­is­ers and even the club will im­ple­ment the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions.”</p>
    <p>The re­turn of the event is pos­i­tive news as mea­sures have been eased in re­cent months to al­low for the restart of live elite sport. The Sin­ga­pore Premier League foot­ball com­pe­ti­tion re­sumed on Oct 17 while mixed mar­tial art or­gan­i­sa­tion One Cham­pi­onship staged live fights on Oct 9 and al­lowed 250 fans for the first time on Oct 30 at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium. One’s third show here with a live au­di­ence, also up to 250 spec­ta­tors, will be on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The One live shows are part of a govern­ment pilot project to help iden­tify a model for the safe stag­ing of large-scale events in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The HSBC tour­na­ment will be sig­nif­i­cant due to the scale of op­er­a­tions. Last year’s event fea­tured an in­ter­na­tional field of 63 play­ers com­pris­ing 16 na­tion­al­i­ties. Most of the golfers will bring their own cad­dies and, in­clud­ing for­eign of­fi­cials and tour­na­ment staff, stag­ing the event next year will in­volve at least a few hun­dred peo­ple.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, had some reser­va­tions but noted: “If the golfers and their team mem­bers are be­ing tested fre­quently through­out the event, then pro­vided so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are in place, it should be pos­si­ble to do this tour­na­ment with­out too much risk, both to par­tic­i­pants and the Sin­ga­pore pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>The na­ture of golf be­ing an out­door sport will help al­low ad­e­quate spac­ing and re­duced risk of trans­mis­sion, though he said the par­tic­i­pants “should be given a rel­a­tively con­trolled itin­er­ary, ideally with ad­di­tional tests if in Sin­ga­pore for longer than a few days”.</p>
    <p>There were two pos­i­tive coron­avirus cases de­tected ahead of One’s In­side the Matrix event on Oct 30 and an­other be­fore the Dec 4 show. All three in­di­vid­u­als ar­rived from over­seas and were iden­ti­fied as part of es­tab­lished pro­to­cols by the or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures in­clude re­quir­ing all for­eign-based ath­letes, cor­ner­men and staff to be iso­lated un­til they re­ceive a neg­a­tive test re­sult, af­ter which they will fol­low a strictly con­trolled itin­er­ary that has been pre-ap­proved.</p>
    <p>For­eign-based ath­letes and One’s pro­duc­tion crew are also re­quired to be tested four times.</p>
    <p>The golf tour­na­ment spokesman said: “The safety and well-be­ing of every­one in­volved re­mains the ab­so­lute pri­or­ity. The or­gan­is­ers will work closely with the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties to en­sure that strict pro­to­cols are in place should a pos­i­tive case be de­tected.”</p>
    <p>If the golfers and their team mem­bers are be­ing tested fre­quently through­out the event, then pro­vided so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are in place, it should be pos­si­ble to do this tour­na­ment with­out too much risk.</p>
