    <p>Hav­ing thought about the be­hav­iour of that man who ha­rassed me and the other em­ploy­ees, I’ve be­come able to a cer­tain ex­tent to pre­dict how those with author­ity wield vi­o­lence upon those around them. ’’ AU­THOR KIKUKO TSUMURA (right), who was emo­tion­ally bul­lied by a for­mer boss</p>
    <p>A young wo­man moves through a se­ries of jobs.</p>
    <p>There is the sur­veil­lance job in which she sits all day in front of screens, watch­ing a man work from home. There is the job in which she writes copy for bus ad­ver­tise­ments.</p>
    <p>There is the job in which she comes up with fun facts to be printed on the backs of rice cracker pack­ets.</p>
    <p>She has em­barked on this se­ries of so-called “easy jobs” af­ter de­vel­op­ing burnout at an ear­lier work­place, forc­ing her to quit and go back to liv­ing with her par­ents.</p>
    <p>None of the new jobs proves en­tirely sat­is­fac­tory, how­ever. In fact, some turn out a tad bizarre.</p>
    <p>There’s No Such Thing As An Easy Job – Ja­panese au­thor Kikuko Tsumura’s first novel to be trans­lated into English – de­buts at the top of The Sun­day Times’ best­seller list for fic­tion this week.</p>
    <p>The trans­la­tion by Polly Bar­ton comes out in a time of enor­mous em­ploy­ment pre­car­ity world­wide, with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic putting the brakes on economies ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>Tsumura, 42, is ac­claimed i n Ja­pan for her ex­is­ten­tial work­place fic­tion and wry por­traits of the daily grind.</p>
    <p>She won the pres­ti­gious Aku­ta­gawa Prize in 2009 for Po­tosu Raimu No Fune (The Lime Pothos Boat), a novella in which a young wo­man works mul­ti­ple low-wage, part-time jobs and dreams of an unaf­ford­able va­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Tsumura her­self ex­pe­ri­enced work­place ha­rass­ment at her first per­ma­nent job, a 10-month stint at a print­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>“My boss there was men­tally un­sta­ble and I was sub­ject to such bad emo­tional black­mail that I quit,” she says through a trans­la­tor in an e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“It was a to­tally un­rea­son­able sit­u­a­tion. How­ever, hav­ing thought for over a decade about the be­hav­iour of that man who ha­rassed me and the other em­ploy­ees, I’ve be­come able to a cer­tain ex­tent to pre­dict how those with author­ity wield</p>
    <p>vi­o­lence upon those around them.</p>
    <p>“I keep on writ­ing about this sub­ject and my hope is, if pos­si­ble, to re­duce the stress of read­ers who’ve had un­rea­son­able ex­pe­ri­ences like that and help them see that it wasn’t their fault.”</p>
    <p>Tsumura is among a wave of best-sell­ing Ja­panese fe­male writ­ers giv­ing voice to women in the work­place, from Sayaka Mu­rata – whose Con­ve­nience Store Wo­man (2016, trans­lated 2018), is about an over­whelm­ingly ded­i­cated con­ve­nience-store em­ployee – to Mieko Kawakami, who wrote about work­ing-class women in Breasts And Eggs (2008, trans­lated this year).</p>
    <p>Tsumura went on to work at a ge­o­log­i­cal sur­vey com­pany for 101/ years, fil­ing re­ports for</p>
    <p>2 clients. Be­tween the ages of 27 and 34, she jug­gled full-time work with writ­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter work, she would head to a cafe to write. Then she would go home, take a nap, wake up in the mid­dle of the night to con­tinue writ­ing, catch some more sleep and then get up to go to work.</p>
    <p>She says she made up all the jobs in There’s No Such Thing As An Easy Job. “It’s pos­si­ble that all of those jobs do ac­tu­ally ex­ist, but I wrote them purely from imag­i­na­tion, with­out do­ing any re­search. They were jobs that I felt that I’d like to do, if they ex­isted.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “The nar­ra­tor changes jobs many times, ex­pe­ri­enc­ing both sat­is­fac­tion and frus­tra­tion, but ul­ti­mately she keeps on mov­ing for­ward, some­times vol­un­tar­ily and some­times pushed on by her sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“I’d like it if this would help read­ers to know that even if they en­counter feel­ings of de­spair in their work­ing life, that doesn’t have to be the end and some­thing else will come around.”</p>
