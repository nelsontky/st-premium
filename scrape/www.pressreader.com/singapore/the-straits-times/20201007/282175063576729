    <p>A GREAT MOMENT</p>
    <p>This project showed us that hon­esty pays. Mr Wang was let off the hook be­cause he was apolo­getic and sin­cere... We all know some­one who is suf­fer­ing in this dif­fi­cult pe­riod and such a feel-good project will surely put a smile on some­one’s face or a warm fuzzy feel­ing in their hearts. We live for mo­ments like these to make oth­ers happy.</p>
    <p>Kiss92 ra­dio DJ Maddy Bar­ber was an­noyed when she found her car side-view mir­ror knocked cleanly off: till she found an apol­ogy note.</p>
    <p>The note was from truck driver Mr Wang Yaowen, who had just started work at his new job. He had sideswiped her car that was parked along Seng Poh Road in Tiong Bahru last Thurs­day, and had left her a note with his apolo­gies and con­tact de­tails.</p>
    <p>She was moved when she called Mr Wang, who sin­cerely apol­o­gised and seemed like a “de­cent, stand-up guy”. She said: “There was so much sin­cer­ity, good­ness and hon­esty in his voice. Mr Wang took full re­spon­si­bil­ity for the ac­ci­dent and gave no ex­cuses. I heard that he was new to Sin­ga­pore, and I de­cided to let it go. I just couldn’t make him pay for the re­pairs.”</p>
    <p>Rather than ask­ing for com­pen­sa­tion, Ms Bar­ber de­cided to do some­thing for Mr Wang in­stead. In­spired by a TikTok chal­lenge, she and her Kiss92 team an­nounced a “trade-up project” that very day, wel­com­ing sub­mis­sions from lis­ten­ers for items that they would swop for her bro­ken side-view mir­ror. The idea is that each trade sees Ms Bar­ber get an item of higher value.</p>
    <p>Of­fers streamed in from lis­ten­ers for that first trade on Mon­day, which in­cluded a big bot­tle of</p>
    <p>Nutella, a used um­brella, a gro­cery voucher, and even a hug and a kiss.</p>
    <p>In the end, Ms Bar­ber traded her bro­ken mir­ror for a brand-new hand­made teak wood desk set worth over $450, from Mr Mei Jie Xiang, the owner of Papa Van­ture’s, a lo­gis­tics firm .</p>
    <p>Then came a sur­prise: BMW of­fered to do a free re­pair for her car.</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­ber and her co-hosts plan to con­tinue with this trade-up project over the next weeks. The item from the fi­nal trade will be gifted to Mr Wang. “If peo­ple con­tinue to trade up, we’ll see where it goes: maybe it could lead you to some­thing big and un­ex­pected,” she said.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­ers at Kiss92 told The</p>
    <p>Kiss92 ra­dio DJ Maddy Bar­ber, on the “trade-up project” that fi­nally re­sulted, fol­low­ing Mr Wang Yaowen’s ac­ci­dent</p>
    <p>Straits Times they wanted to see if they could con­vert some­thing like Ms Bar­ber’s bro­ken side-view mir­ror into some­thing of sig­nif­i­cant value. “This project showed us that hon­esty pays. Mr Wang was let off the hook be­cause he was apolo­getic and sin­cere. Maddy was sur­prised by BMW with the free re­pairs, and we are learning that Kiss fans are the most gen­er­ous peo­ple in the coun­try,” said Mr An­dre Hoe­den, pre­sen­ter and ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer of Ms Bar­ber’s ra­dio show.</p>
    <p>“We all know some­one who is suf­fer­ing in this dif­fi­cult pe­riod and such a feel-good project will surely put a smile on some­one’s face or a warm fuzzy feel­ing in their hearts. We live for mo­ments like these to make oth­ers happy,” he added.</p>
    <p>For Ms Bar­ber, her good in­ten­tions have also come full cir­cle with a happy twist of sorts in BMW’s of­fer, so it’s been a re­ally good start to the project.</p>
