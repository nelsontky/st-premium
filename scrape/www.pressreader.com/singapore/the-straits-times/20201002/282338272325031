    <p>•</p>
    <p>PARIS The or­gan­is­ers of the Paris 2024 Olympics an­nounced a swathe of cost-cut­ting mea­sures on Wed­nes­day which are set to slash €400 mil­lion (S$640.6 mil­lion) from the Games’ bill.</p>
    <p>The most high-pro­file of the changes, which still have to be rat­i­fied by the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC), sees the swim­ming events re­moved from the so­cially-de­prived area of Saint-De­nis just north of the city and re­lo­cated to the fi­nan­cial district of La De­fense.</p>
    <p>Vol­ley­ball has also been moved from Saint-De­nis which does, how­ever, hold on to climb­ing and rugby sevens which will be staged at the ex­ist­ing Stade de France.</p>
    <p>The changes are ex­pected to save €400 mil­lion from an ini­tial bud­get of €3.8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The changes showed “re­spon­si­bil­ity, so­bri­ety, pop­u­lar com­mit­ment” while main­tain­ing the “am­bi­tion” of the Olympics, said the pres­i­dent of the lo­cal or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee (Cojo), Tony Es­tanguet.</p>
    <p>“We are not touch­ing the sports pro­gramme,” he said af­ter a board meet­ing of the or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>“We are try­ing to fit every­thing into fewer sites.”</p>
    <p>Swim­ming will now be staged in a tem­po­rary pool within the La De­fense Arena, an all-pur­pose in­door arena which is home to the Rac­ing 92 rugby team and, prior to Covid-19, hosted con­certs by stars in­clud­ing Paul Mc­Cart­ney.</p>
    <p>The tem­po­rary pool will then be moved to Saint-De­nis as part of the “legacy” in line with the orig­i­nal plans.</p>
    <p>Es­tanguet said the changes, which had been an­nounced in prin­ci­ple in the sum­mer, were nec­es­sary given “the un­cer­tainty of the eco­nomic cri­sis” caused by the coro­n­avirus and also to off­set the “ex­tra cost” of ad­di­tional sports.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral new sports will be added to the Olympic pro­gramme at Paris 2024: climb­ing, break­danc­ing, skate­board­ing and surf­ing.</p>
    <p>Es­tanguet also said that spon­sor­ship rev­enue, for which a de­crease was feared, al­ready amounted to €502 mil­lion from a planned €1.1 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>In mid-Septem­ber, the de­part­men­tal head of Saint-De­nis, Stephane Trous­sel, warned against mak­ing the area “an ad­just­ment vari­able” of the Olympics.</p>
    <p>The loss of swim­ming and vol­ley­ball has been com­pen­sated in part by the ar­rival of climb­ing which was orig­i­nally due to take place in Place de la Con­corde in the heart of Paris.</p>
    <p>The climb­ing wall will re­main af­ter the Games.</p>
    <p>Trous­sel also eased concerns that the me­dia vil­lage in the town of Dugny, close to Le Bour­get air­port, might fall foul of the cuts.</p>
    <p>It was in­tended to be trans­formed af­ter the Games into a res­i­den­tial district with 1,300 hous­ing units.</p>
    <p>“The me­dia vil­lage is saved, there are guar­an­tees on that hap­pen­ing,” he said af­ter Wed­nes­day’s meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The board of di­rec­tors also agreed to the re­duc­tion in the num­ber of sta­di­ums for the foot­ball tour­na­ments from eight to seven.</p>
    <p>The changes to the sites are ex­pected to save €150 mil­lion, in­clud­ing €60 mil­lion from mov­ing the swim­ming events, ac­cord­ing to sources close to mem­bers of the board of di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>Other sav­ings will be made on other items, such as trans­port.</p>
    <p>Es­tanguet also con­firmed that Cojo “was still con­sid­er­ing out­sourc­ing part of its op­er­a­tions to out­side op­er­a­tors”.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal map will not be known un­til mid-De­cem­ber when it will go to the IOC for ap­proval.</p>
    <p>We are not touch­ing the sports pro­gramme. We are try­ing to fit every­thing into fewer sites. ’’</p>
    <p>TONY ES­TANGUET, pres­i­dent of the Paris 2024 or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee.</p>
