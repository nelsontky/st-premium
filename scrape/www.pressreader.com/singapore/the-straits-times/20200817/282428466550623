    <p>NEW YORK When Ms Al­lyn Mor­ri­son was fur­loughed from her job as a barista at The Perk in Fort Worth, Texas, the 25-year-old ac­tor de­cided to spend the l ock­down stream­ing shows like Unortho­dox (2020) and Brook­lyn Nine-Nine (2013 to present).</p>
    <p>She was not goof­ing off, she ex­plained – she was just try­ing to sharpen her act­ing skills.</p>
    <p>In the United States, the com­bi­na­tion of 30 mil­lion Amer­i­cans out of work and tens of mil­lions more work­ing from home in­creased the num­ber of hours peo­ple have been glued to a screen.</p>
    <p>In­deed, stream­ing jumped by 20 per cent when coro­n­avirus shut­downs first be­gan back in March.</p>
    <p>With US in­fec­tions out of con­trol in some states and death rates ris­ing, new re­stric­tions are be­ing put in place and more schools are plan­ning on re­mote learn­ing.</p>
    <p>In other words, the pan­demic spike in tele­vi­sion, stream­ing and even so­cial me­dia “doom­scrolling” may be here for awhile. And all that ad­di­tional screen-time? Well, it could be bad for you.</p>
    <p>The LED light emit­ted from most screens ex­poses your eyes to high lev­els of “blue light,” which can dis­rupt sleep pat­terns and lead to “com­puter vi­sion syn­drome”, as­so­ci­ated with headaches and eye­strain, said oph­thal­mol­o­gist Robert We­in­stock.</p>
    <p>And while he ac­knowl­edges that it may be hard for peo­ple to re­duce the amount of time they are spend­ing in front of screens these days, there are ways to make it safer.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing in screen cov­ers that fil­ter out harsher light from lap­tops and phones is one op­tion, and, of course, you can turn down the screen bright­ness or look away for 20 sec­onds ev­ery once in a while.</p>
    <p>But while many work­places have sought to mit­i­gate em­ployee eye­strain over the years, the un­prece­dented ef­fect of the pan­demic – given the mass mi­gra­tion to home en­vi­ron­ments that can be less eye­friendly – has yet to fully man­i­fest it­self.</p>
    <p>In the first months of lock­downs, peo­ple spent al­most an hour more on their desk­top de­vices, ac­cord­ing to an anal­y­sis of 14,000 users tracked by soft­ware com­pany Res­cueTime.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions tools drove the shift – with video-chat time surg­ing 350 per cent, so­cial me­dia up 200 per cent and en­ter­tain­ment plat­forms like Net­flix and YouTube ris­ing 200 per cent.</p>
    <p>Com­cast said it saw In­ter­net traf­fic on its net­work spike by as much as 60 per cent in some ar­eas as the pan­demic set in.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have also been spend­ing more time on top so­cial me­dia apps: The to­tal time on seven of the big­gest, in­clud­ing Twit­ter and Face­book, is higher this year than last, based on data from app anal­y­sis com­pany App­topia.</p>
    <p>“The say­ing goes, ‘ ris­ing tides raise all ships’, and that was the case for tele­vi­sion and dig­i­tal screen­based me­dia over­all,” Mr Peter Kats­in­gris, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of au­di­ence in­sights at mar­ket­ing re­search com­pany Nielsen, wrote in an email.</p>
    <p>But it comes with a price. Sleep de­pri­va­tion is a com­mon prob­lem as­so­ci­ated with an uptick i n screen time. Ex­po­sure to blue light be­fore bed­time can make it harder to get to sleep, pos­si­bly through sup­press­ing the pro­duc­tion of me­la­tonin.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially the case for close-prox­im­ity de­vices such as lap­tops and mo­bile phones. Dry eye can also be a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The Mayo Clinic sug­gests adding mois­ture to the air, tak­ing breaks dur­ing longer tasks, po­si­tion­ing your com­puter screen be­low eye level and us­ing ar­ti­fi­cial tears. Ex­perts re­main di­vided on whether blue light glasses are ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>The best way to cut time in front of your phone is to des­ig­nate a time or day that is screen-free, ac­cord­ing to Dr Adam Al­ter, au­thor of the book, Ir­re­sistible: The Rise Of Ad­dic­tive Tech­nol­ogy And The Busi­ness Of Keep­ing Us Hooked.</p>
    <p>That can mean putting it in a locked drawer dur­ing din­ner, stop­ping an hour be­fore go­ing to bed, or turn­ing it on air­plane mode for large chunks of the week­end.</p>
    <p>“You just have to be mind­ful and pur­pose­ful, and to cul­ti­vate the habit of leav­ing your phone as far away from where you are as pos­si­ble,” Dr Al­ter wrote in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>But time away from a screen is not fea­si­ble for Amer­i­cans work­ing from home. For now at least, Amer­i­cans are stuck be­tween a screen and a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Some seem to think screen time may re­cede – Net­flix, which added more than 25 mil­lion pay­ing sub­scribers in the first half of the year, fore­casts lower sub­scrip­tion growth for the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>But Mr Kats­in­gris is not so sure. “It’s such an un­pre­dictable time as states and busi­nesses across the coun­try are all at dif­fer­ent stages of open­ing and clos­ing,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“Whether schools re­open or re­main closed in the au­tumn is a fac­tor to keep an eye on in re­gards to me­dia con­sump­tion.”</p>
    <p>So it is re­ally up to in­di­vid­u­als to reg­u­late them­selves.</p>
    <p>Ms Mor­ri­son tried to mon­i­tor how much time she was look­ing at a screen and take breaks. Now she is back at work at The Perk, and no longer stuck at home all day.</p>
    <p>“It’s great to just go some­where and not have to be here,” she said.</p>
