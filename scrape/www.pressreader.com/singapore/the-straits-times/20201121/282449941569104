    <p>A tighter part­ner­ship is needed be­tween busi­nesses and the Gov­ern­ment so that reg­u­la­tions can be ag­ile and adapt to chang­ing needs and in­no­va­tions, said Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at the Pro-En­ter­prise Panel and Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) Awards cer­e­mony, which was held in a hy­brid for­mat to recog­nise or­gan­i­sa­tions that worked to cre­ate a pro-busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>It also marks the 20th an­niver­sary of the Pro-En­ter­prise Panel, a pri­vate-pub­lic panel that aims to pro­vide so­lu­tions to the reg­u­la­tory is­sues that busi­nesses face.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said that the way reg­u­la­tions are used has to change from be­ing pro­tec­tive and ef­fi­cient, to be­come pro­gres­sive and en­abling in­stead.</p>
    <p>If we adopt a con­sis­tent logic and are ever con­scious of the cost of com­pli­ance and reg­u­late on the ba­sis of good sci­ence and sound eco­nom­ics, it will strengthen our role as a hub for new busi­ness ideas.</p>
    <p>MIN­IS­TER FOR TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY CHAN CHUN SING, on how Sin­ga­pore can boost its hub sta­tus.</p>
    <p>“We have to op­ti­mise our reg­u­la­tions at the sys­tem level to en­able new busi­nesses, en­cour­age in­no­va­tion and fa­cil­i­tate busi­ness growth,” he said, adding that this is why reg­u­la­tions have to be ag­ile and not static.</p>
    <p>He said: “We want the best of both worlds – we want pre­dictabil­ity and con­sis­tency in the logic with which we reg­u­late and yet, at the same time, we want the agility to be able to adapt to cir­cum­stances as they evolve, or even pre­empt the sit­u­a­tions that may arise.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the Hous­ing Board im­ple­mented a reg­u­la­tory sand­box with FairPrice and Bread­Talk to pilot a way to bring food more eas­ily to res­i­dents, in re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive, called Food and Gro­ceries on Wheels, al­lowed vans to bring gro­ceries to res­i­dents across 19 des­ig­nated carparks.</p>
    <p>This helped el­derly res­i­dents and those who are less mo­bile to buy pro­vi­sions more eas­ily amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple agen­cies, such as En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, were also in­volved, to bal­ance reg­u­la­tory con­cerns with busi­ness needs.</p>
    <p>But for reg­u­la­tions to keep pace with new busi­ness de­vel­op­ments, there has to be much closer part­ner­ship be­tween the pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tors, Mr Chan added.</p>
    <p>“If the reg­u­la­tors do not know what the busi­nesses are do­ing, the reg­u­la­tors may end up be­ing the ob</p>
    <p>sta­cle to the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of the ideas.”</p>
    <p>SBF chair­man Lim Ming Yan said: “This col­lab­o­ra­tion is par­tic­u­larly crit­i­cal as the Covid-19 pan­demic has sig­nif­i­cantly re­shaped the busi­ness land­scape.</p>
    <p>“Busi­nesses should max­imise this op­por­tu­nity to trans­form and proac­tively pro­vide con­struc­tive feed­back to the Gov­ern­ment, to im­prove rules and li­cens­ing frame­works, speed up pro­cesses and fa­cil­i­tate trans­for­ma­tion of busi­ness ideas.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said one way around this is for more pub­lic ser­vice of­fi­cers to be at­tached to pri­vate firms to ex­change in­for­ma­tion and ideas.</p>
    <p>“At the fron­tiers of reg­u­la­tions, we (also) need to form a commu</p>
    <p>nity of prac­tice, where the lat­est ideas, tech­no­log­i­cal progress and pro­cesses in the in­dus­try are shared with the reg­u­la­tors, and both sides are in reg­u­lar con­ver­sa­tion with one an­other.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan re­it­er­ated that Sin­ga­pore’s com­mit­ment to reg­u­la­tory trans­parency and pre­dictabil­ity will not change. This also means ex­er­cis­ing dis­ci­pline in im­pos­ing reg­u­la­tions, be­cause each one has com­pli­ance costs.</p>
    <p>“If we adopt a con­sis­tent logic and are ever con­scious of the cost of com­pli­ance and reg­u­late on the ba­sis of good sci­ence and sound eco­nom­ics, it will strengthen our role as a hub for new busi­ness ideas,” he added.</p>
