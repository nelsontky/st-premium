    <p>A plaque placed by Thai pro­test­ers to de­clare that Thai­land be­longs to the peo­ple and not the king was re­moved overnight from near the Grand Palace in Bangkok. The po­lice said yes­ter­day they may charge those be­hind the sym­bolic ges­ture.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK A plaque placed by Thai pro­test­ers to de­clare that Thai­land be­longs to the peo­ple and not the king was re­moved from near the Grand Palace i n Bangkok overnight and po­lice said yes­ter­day they may charge those be­hind the sym­bolic ges­ture.</p>
    <p>The plaque was ce­mented in place on Sun­day af­ter a rally by tens of thou­sands of peo­ple who cheered calls for re­forms to the monar­chy of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, the lat­est chal­lenge since ac­tivists broke a long­stand­ing taboo on crit­i­cis­ing the coun­try’s royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said the plaque had been handed over by of­fi­cials from the Bangkok city author­ity and the gov­ern­ment’s Fine Arts De­part­ment. An of­fi­cer said it was “to keep as ev­i­dence to press charges against pro­test­ers”.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers voiced lit­tle sur­prise that the brass plaque had been re­moved af­ter less than a day.</p>
    <p>Protest leader Parit “Pen­guin” Chi­warak told re­porters that an elec­tronic file of the plaque was be­ing shared to en­able peo­ple to make more of them and place them wher­ever they want.</p>
    <p>“The plaque was al­ready placed in the hearts of peo­ple. You may re­move it but we will make a new one,” he said.</p>
    <p>The al­most-im­me­di­ate re­moval of the plaque re­flects that “arch-roy­al­ists are not only in­censed by de­mands for monar­chi­cal re­form but are also not go­ing to put up with any sym­bols that even re­flect op­po­si­tion to the palace”, said Dr Paul</p>
    <p>Cham­bers of Nare­suan Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have grown ever bolder dur­ing two months of demon­stra­tions against Thai­land’s palace and mil­i­tary-dom­i­nated es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cis­ing the monar­chy is il­le­gal</p>
    <p>un­der lese ma­jeste laws, but re­cent ar­rests of more than a dozen ac­tivists – in­clud­ing Mr Parit – were made on other grounds. All have since been re­leased on bail.</p>
    <p>Sun­day’s demon­stra­tion was the biggest since the 2014 coup that brought Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha to power.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have called for his re­moval, a new Con­sti­tu­tion and elec­tions, as well as for royal re­forms.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Prayut wel­comed the fact that the protest was peace­ful. “Na­tion, re­li­gion and monar­chy are the up­most pil­lars of the Thai peo­ple,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tors say the Con­sti­tu­tion gives the king too much power and that it was en­gi­neered to al­low Mr Prayut to hold on to power af­ter last year’s elec­tion. The Prime Min­is­ter says that vote was fair.</p>
    <p>The sym­bol­ism of the plaque is its re­sem­blance to the one that had com­mem­o­rated the end of ab­so­lute monar­chy in 1932 and which was re­moved from out­side a royal palace in 2017, af­ter King Va­ji­ra­longkorn took the throne.</p>
    <p>The plaque says “this coun­try be­longs to the peo­ple and is not the prop­erty of the monarch as they have de­ceived us”.</p>
    <p>Mr Craig Ku­nakorn, 33, a bar­ber who was at the protests, yes­ter­day vis­ited the spot where the plaque had been ce­mented i nto the ground. “Every­one knew it would dis­ap­pear soon but the suc­cess of cre­at­ing it is some­thing that will con­tinue. It is still an im­por­tant sym­bol,” he said.</p>
