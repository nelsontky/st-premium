    <p>STA Travel, which had a strong pres­ence in uni­ver­si­ties here, is wind­ing up, af­fect­ing as many as 682 cus­tomers who are listed as cred­i­tors for sums pos­si­bly go­ing up to $84,088.</p>
    <p>It stopped oper­at­ing on Sept 9 af­ter its par­ent com­pany based in Switzer­land filed for in­sol­vency last month.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial cred­i­tors were listed in a no­tice is­sued last Thurs­day by one of the ap­pointed pro­vi­sional liq­uida­tors from au­dit firm Deloitte & Touche, on be­half of STA Travel.</p>
    <p>The small­est sum was $7. The big­gest sum of $84,088 is said to be owed to an in­di­vid­ual, but the no­tice also lists or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU), the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) and Repub­lic Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>The no­tice said cred­i­tors will still need to file proof of the debt said to be owed.</p>
    <p>Among the 682 on the list is NUS un­der­grad­u­ate Teoh Xin Yi, 22, who had re­ceived $917 in STA Travel vouch­ers af­ter her flight to Ja­pan was can­celled in April due to travel re­stric­tions amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>She was headed there to con­tinue her stud­ies as part of her dou­ble-de­gree pro­gramme at Tokyo’s Waseda Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Ms Teoh, a po­lit­i­cal sci­ence ma­jor who is now con­tin­u­ing her stud­ies in NUS, said she is not hope­ful about get­ting her money back. “The (Deloitte & Touche) no­tice did not pro­vide any instructio­ns or as­sur­ances on how we can be re­im­bursed.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that many univer­sity stu­dents who booked flights with the travel agency, such as for ex­change pro­grammes, were af­fected.</p>
    <p>Be­fore STA Travel was put into pro­vi­sional liq­ui­da­tion, it had re­tail lo­ca­tions in NTU, NUS and SMU, where stu­dents could book dis­counted flights and special travel deals such as the Lon­don Ex­plorer tour and the Eu­rail pass.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) told ST yes­ter­day that STA Travel was one of 22 travel agents which stopped op­er­a­tions be­tween Feb 1 and yes­ter­day. This is fewer than the 40 ces­sa­tions in the same pe­riod a year ago.</p>
    <p>But STA Travel’s case was the only one for the stip­u­lated pe­riod this year to im­pact cus­tomers, the tourism board said.</p>
    <p>More than half – 15 – of the 22 com­pa­nies in­di­cated they had ceased op­er­a­tions be­cause of Covid-19, while the rest cited var­i­ous rea­sons such as a change in busi­ness fo­cus and re­tire­ment, STB said.</p>
    <p>A Deloitte & Touche spokesman told ST yes­ter­day that the di­rec­tors of STA Travel in Sin­ga­pore “had to take the most re­spon­si­ble ap­proach for all stake­hold­ers by plac­ing the com­pany into pro­vi­sional liq­ui­da­tion, given the com­pany’s in­sol­vent fi­nan­cial po­si­tion”.</p>
    <p>All known cred­i­tors were no­ti­fied last Thurs­day and those who have not re­ceived the no­ti­fi­ca­tion can con­tact the pro­vi­sional liq­uida­tors’ of­fice, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>This leaves them with less than a week to com­plete the pa­per­work needed to ex­er­cise their vot­ing rights as cred­i­tors at the first meet­ing of cred­i­tors to be held on Fri­day via Zoom. Cred­i­tors will need to sub­mit a proof of debt form by noon to­mor­row, with sup­port­ing doc­u­ments such as their in­voices or pay­ments made to STA Travel.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamad Azni, a 59-year-old sports trainer, told ST he is claim­ing $21,162 worth of Qan­tas Air­ways tick­ets for 37 mem­bers of his mar­tial arts club who were headed to Mel­bourne, Aus­tralia, for a com­pe­ti­tion in April. The flights have since been can­celled.</p>
    <p>“Most of my mem­bers are aged seven to 17 years, who had saved up for more than one year to af­ford the air ticket which cost be­tween $500 and $700,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (Case) said it re­ceived 11 com­plaints against STA Travel be­tween Jan 1 and Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Most of the com­plaints were over hav­ing to pay a fee for can­celling flights or be­ing of­fered only par­tial cash re­funds, it added.</p>
    <p>STB said con­sumers who are not cov­ered by travel in­sur­ance can ap­proach Case or the Small Claims Tri­bunal, where ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
