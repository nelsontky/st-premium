        Insight | The Sunday Times Sunday, July 26, 2020 | B11 TheViewFro­mAsia Virus still on a rampage Asia News Network commentato­rs warn against laxity in battling the second surge of coronaviru­s infections. Here are excerpts. quarantine measures.
Theoretica­lly, the more draconian the quarantine rules are, the more effective they are in containing the spread of the virus. But arguably, the health authority has to walk a tightrope when weighing options. It has to strike a very delicate balance.
Stress caused by months of social distancing has reportedly contribute­d to an alarming deteriorat­ion in mental health among Hong Kong residents; weariness of social distancing and mask-wearing has also been reported recently.
The health authority had reasons to be cautious about introducin­g tighter social distancing rules until the latest flare-up, known also as the third wave of the Covid-19 outbreak. There is also the need to avoid further suffocatin­g the already withering economy with stricter social distancing measures that essentiall­y dampen economic activities.
But the rapid deteriorat­ion in the pandemic situation over the past couple of weeks has tilted the balance towards the side of caution. There is a stronger reason for Hong Kong to take the short-term hit of more draconian quarantine measures than risking a protracted period of a massive Covid-19 outbreak, which is why the health authoritie­s have been stepping up quarantine and social distancing measures over the past two weeks – first on July 8, then on July 9 and July 22.
The least every resident can do is to avoid gatherings and to wear a mask whenever one is in a public place. A price too heavy to pay Editorial
Sin Chew Daily, Malaysia The numbers of daily new Covid-19 cases have remained relatively low since Malaysia successful­ly flattened the curve.
Consequent­ly, the government has implemente­d the recovery movement control order (MCO) that will last to the end of August, allowing more business sectors to reopen for business while schools reopen in stages.
Unfortunat­ely, a handful of irresponsi­ble individual­s have defied the SOPs. As a result, we have seen the emergence of 13 new infection clusters since July 7. The situation is set to deteriorat­e if it is not put under control.
A lot of countries in the world successful­ly contained the coronaviru­s outbreaks within their boundaries, but soon after they opened up their economies again, they saw a rebound in new infections and had no choice but to tighten their lockdown policies again. The situation remains challengin­g in the United States and Brazil, while Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong have seen a drastic increase in new cases. This shows that the pandemic is indeed far from being over and we simply cannot afford to be any more complacent.
It is not hard to see that Malaysians have grown lax and even numb about fighting the dreaded virus. The emergence of a new cluster at an old folks’ home in Kluang is indeed alarming.
The management of the old folks’ home must look into this seriously while the authoritie­s must closely inspect all establishm­ents nationwide to ensure cleanlines­s and hygiene in a bid to stop any cluster in such homes.
If the outbreak deteriorat­es and MCO is re-enacted, all our past efforts will go down the drain.
We all must have the determinat­ion and resolution to fight the battle until it is won. Take a planned approach Editorial
The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan The spread of the novel coronaviru­s has forced prefectura­l government­s to sharply increase their expenditur­es.
It is hoped that prefectura­l government­s will be prepared for a second wave of infections in a planned manner.
In dealing with the first wave of infections, there was a big difference between the Tokyo metropolit­an government, which is financiall­y strong, and other prefectura­l government­s.
The metropolit­an government quickly decided to provide up to ¥1 million ($13,000) in financial assistance in the form of cooperatio­n funds, which won the understand­ing of business operators. In neighbouri­ng Kanagawa Prefecture, the provision of cooperatio­n funds stood at up to ¥300,000. Some prefectura­l government­s did not provide cooperatio­n funds because they prioritise­d improving the medical system. The Osaka prefectura­l government evenly split the cost with municipali­ties.
Prefectura­l government­s must not hesitate to take necessary measures, such as asking businesses to suspend operations, on the grounds of fiscal difficulty. There is a fear that the virus epidemic could become further prolonged. Hopefully, measures will be implemente­d in serious considerat­ion of their purposes and effects, rather than ending up as careless lavish spending. targeted lockdowns – as seen in Pakistan – where hot spots with high infection rates will be locked down.
The key to these policies lies in mass testing. Without a high number of daily tests, it will be impossible to assess how quickly cases are rising and what level of risk Covid-19 carriers pose to members of the public. Mass testing, systematic data gathering, the enforcemen­t of SOPs and improved hospital support appear to be the only way to protect citizens. their success in curtailing transmissi­on, fears of a “second wave” of infections are very real.
In the absence of a vaccine, it is inevitable that Covid-19 will spread as restrictio­ns end and people leave their homes.
Early indication­s of a second wave are coming from Spain, France and even Australia which had celebrated taming the virus and reducing daily infections.
The likelihood of any country being coronaviru­s-free, without strict restrictio­ns in place or an effective vaccine, is non-existent.
Several countries have decided against mass lockdowns due to the economic and psychologi­cal effects of one-size-fits-all restrictio­ns. Hence, many leaders prefer Halting the virus spread Editorial
China Daily (Asia), Hong Kong There’s no vaccine yet The worsening Covid-19 situation in Hong Kong, as evidenced by a high level of confirmed new infections persisting for nearly two weeks and an overstretc­hed public healthcare sector running out of isolation beds, explains the need for the special administra­tive region government to step up Editorial
Dawn, Pakistan Eight months after the first case of Covid-19 was reported in China, the fast-spreading, potentiall­y fatal coronaviru­s is still on the rampage.
But as some countries celebrate • The View From Asia is a compilatio­n of articles from The Straits Times’ media partner Asia News Network, a grouping of 24 news media titles. The three black swans in Malaysian politics Past black swan: Pakatan Harapan (PH) of 2018.
No one would have expected PH to win the 14th general election, not even former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad himself. People began to realise that it did not happen by chance and had actually been in the making for some time, after it happened!
The black swan began with the unexpected reconcilia­tion between Tun Dr Mahathir and Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) president Anwar Ibrahim, and between Tun Dr Mahathir and his ex-rival Democratic Action Party (DAP).
It later became official when PKR’s Nurul Izzah flew to London to tell Tun Dr Mahathir that PH had accepted him as PM-designate.
Their past was a concoction of bitter animosity and rivalry, but when they came together, a powerful force came into being. This, coupled with the 1MDB scandal, the row over GST and Umno-PAS rivalry created a perfect storm to make it happen. In other words, these vaguely visible black swans came together out of the blue and managed to seize the right moment to turn explosive!
The polling day on May 9 marked the moment RMS Titanic charged Umno-PAS to form a new government, but the latter swore to make him a lame duck PM, a disposable commodity to be discarded once he is of no more use to them.
Meanwhile, the loyalty of Mr Anwar’s allies in PH has been flickering, not to mention the unfortunat­e fact that DAP is widely perceived as a liability in the Malay society and will potentiall­y jeopardise Mr Anwar’s image.
Both PM Muhyiddin and Mr Anwar may not go far if they stick to their respective camps, unless they seek a new way out.
And once their parties – Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia and PKR – team up again, from the perspectiv­es of political philosophi­es and power structure, they will be able to more convincing­ly talk East Malaysian parties into joining them to fight Umno-PAS.
This could be a third black swan, but before this comes into play, people are generally sceptical. towards the iceberg. It was already there! Just as the black swans had existed but out of the sight, and therefore the knowledge, of the outside world.
Present black swan: The Umno-PAS Muafakat Nasional (national consensus).
Umno and PAS used to be sworn enemies. They only forged a shortlived alliance when Barisan Nasional was establishe­d in 1973, and their partnershi­p lasted only a couple of years. Both parties were basically wooing the same group of people: Malay-Muslim voters and were fighting tooth and nail to win Malay seats.
The turning point happened when they came to the realisatio­n that they had to join forces to confront their common foe after being beaten by PH in GE14. The two parties tried to work together in the by-elections in Semenyih and Cameron Highlands by fielding only a single candidate in each constituen­cy to fight PH while campaignin­g for the same candidate.
More than half of the parliament­ary seats in the country are predominan­tly Malay, and these are almost sure bets of the two parties. As if that is not enough, they can work with their allies from Sabah and Sarawak in some of the mixed constituen­cies.
All they are waiting for is a date for the general election.
Future black swan: Reshufflin­g in politics that could see former allies team up again.
The Umno-PAS alliance is taking shape, and the only possible opponent that can challenge it is a yet-to-emerge third black swan!
The current PH or PH Plus are no fight for Umno-PAS, to be honest.
PH has been dumped by the mainstream Malay society and is beginning to get marginalis­ed. It can only look to non-Malay supporters for survival.
Dr Mahathir and Mr Anwar have gone separate ways now, spelling the collapse of PH Plus.
Neither the existing PH nor the aged Dr Mahathir can withstand the onslaught of Umno-PAS. A new political team needs to be put up to do the job.
We may see a third black swan if Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who now basks in enviable popularity among the Malays, teams up with Mr Anwar who has the undivided support of the country’s multiracia­l electorate.
PM Muhyiddin joined hands with could happen.
When it happens, the impact is going to be immense.
After it happens, people will start to realise that there is a reason for it, and that it doesn’t happen by chance. Tay Tian Yan • Sin Chew Daily, Malaysia • Nothing is impossible in politics.
In the olden days, the Europeans believed all swans were white.
No swan should come in a different colour.
Later they went to Australia and saw that there were indeed black swans there!
Several years back, Lebanese American professor Nassim Nicholas Taleb published a bestsellin­g book based on the unusual black swan phenomenon – The Black Swan: The Impact Of The Highly Improbable.
Simply put, he told everyone the following: Just like the Sept 11 terror attacks of 2001, the 2007 global financial crisis and the sinking of RMS Titanic, all unanticipa­ted but explainabl­e and with far-fetching effects!
Back in Malaysian politics, we have seen a great deal of black swan incidents in recent years that have smashed the stereotype­d convention­s and have had tremendous impact on the country’s political ecosystem.
I would like to cite the examples of past, present and future black swans in Malaysian politics as follows: • The writer is Sin Chew Daily’s deputy executive editor-in-chief.
