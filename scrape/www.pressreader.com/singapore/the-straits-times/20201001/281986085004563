    <p>Some po­lit­i­cal de­bates have high­lights. The first pres­i­den­tial de­bate this year had only lowlights.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den called US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump “a clown”. Mr Trump said Mr Bi­den wasn’t smart. Mr Bi­den said Mr Trump “has been a fool”. And on it went, in what must have been the nas­ti­est pres­i­den­tial de­bate in United States his­tory.</p>
    <p>The most com­mon word in the tran­script will be “(crosstalk)”.</p>
    <p>Whose at­tacks landed best? The Trump cam­paign’s cen­tral cri­tiques of the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent are that he is old and out of it, that he has spent too much time in DC, and that he is too weak to re­sist his party’s left wing.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den had a cou­ple of se­nior mo­ments dur­ing the de­bate. He for­got some of the de­tails of his health­care plan: The new gov­ern­ment in­surance plan he wants to cre­ate would not be lim­ited to Med­i­caid pa­tients, as he said. He flip-flopped twice on the Green New Deal in the span of a few sen­tences.</p>
    <p>But there was no dev­as­tat­ing, mem­o­rable mo­ment of be­fud­dle­ment.</p>
    <p>He also had some crisp an­swers, and even a few good lines. (On Covid-19: “It is what it is be­cause you are who you are.”)</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den also, for the most part, man­aged to avoid Mr Trump’s traps, helped by how painfully ob­vi­ous Mr Trump was in set­ting them. The Pres­i­dent said that Mr Bi­den wouldn’t say “law and or­der”, so Mr Bi­den said law, or­der and jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den ducked the ques­tion of whether he sup­ports pack­ing the Supreme Court, on the grounds that he doesn’t want the topic to dom­i­nate the cam­paign – which is an ex­cuse that will al­ways ap­ply to in­con­ve­nient is­sues. Mr Trump, and moder­a­tor Chris Wal­lace, let it slide.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign’s crit­i­cisms of Mr Trump are mostly focused on his char­ac­ter: He cares too much about him­self and not enough about the coun­try, he is di­vi­sive and he is, not to put too fine a point on it, a jerk.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump of­ten seemed de­ter­mined to prove Mr Bi­den’s points. He couldn’t bring him­self to say a kind word about Mr Bi­den’s late son Beau, or to force­fully con­demn white su­prem­a­cists (an is­sue he had to know would come up). He couldn’t even urge his sup­port­ers to stay peace­ful in the event he loses.</p>
    <p>If you are a voter who wor­ries about the is­sues that Mr Bi­den raises about Mr Trump, the Pres­i­dent didn’t set your mind at ease. If you’re a voter who wanted a clear sense of where each can­di­date wanted to take the coun­try, on the other hand, you were out of luck.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther of th­ese can­di­dates is pol­icy-driven, and it showed.</p>
    <p>The left has a clear agenda, but as Mr Bi­den pointed out, he beat it soundly dur­ing the pri­maries.</p>
    <p>Who won the de­bate de­pends on where the can­di­dates stood at the start. If Mr Bi­den is com­fort­ably ahead, as the polls gen­er­ally sug­gest, then</p>
    <p>Mr Trump needed the de­bate to change the race and it didn’t.</p>
    <p>If, on the other hand, the greater en­thu­si­asm of many of Mr Trump’s sup­port­ers and the flaws of the polls make the race more com­pet­i­tive than it looks, the Pres­i­dent is just as much in the hunt as he was.</p>
    <p>The de­bate changed noth­ing, ex­cept to di­min­ish the coun­try’s dig­nity just a lit­tle bit more.</p>
