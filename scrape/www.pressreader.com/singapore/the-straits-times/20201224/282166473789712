    <p>Kep­pel Land is di­vest­ing its 100 per cent in­ter­est in Kep­pel Bay Tower to Kep­pel Reit (real es­tate in­vest­ment trust), based on an agreed prop­erty value of $657.2 mil­lion, in­clu­sive of rental sup­port of up to $3.2 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to ex­change fil­ings yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The agreed prop­erty value took into ac­count two in­de­pen­dent val­u­a­tions by JLL and Cush­man & Wake­field and rep­re­sents a dis­count of around 1.2 per cent and 1.5 per cent on the re­spec­tive val­u­a­tions with rental sup­port as at Nov 30.</p>
    <p>The to­tal ac­qui­si­tion cost for Kep­pel Reit is es­ti­mated to be around $667 mil­lion, af­ter tak­ing into ac­count fees and other costs.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Reit’s man­ager said it in­tends to fund the ac­qui­si­tion with pro­ceeds from eq­uity fund rais­ing through an in­tended pri­vate place­ment, as well as a draw­down of $70 mil­lion from an ex­ist­ing five-year re­volv­ing credit fa­cil­ity, and two new six-year loan fa­cil­i­ties of up to an ag­gre­gate amount of $330 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The size and tim­ing of the eq­uity fund rais­ing have not been de­ter­mined, Kep­pel Reit’s man­ager said, adding that fur­ther de­tails, in­clud­ing the pro­por­tion of debt and eq­uity, will be an­nounced at an ap­pro­pri­ate time.</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Tham, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Reit man­ager, said: “The pro­posed ac­cre­tive ac­qui­si­tion of Kep­pel Bay Tower is part of our on­go­ing port­fo­lio op­ti­mi­sa­tion ef­forts to en­hance the Reit’s dis­tri­bu­tions and im­prove to­tal unit holder re­turns.</p>
    <p>“The strate­gic ad­di­tion of a qual­ity CBD (Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict)-fringe of­fice prop­erty such as Kep­pel Bay Tower, with its es­tab­lished ten­ant base, com­ple­ments our ex­ist­ing port­fo­lio and in­creases in­come re­silience.”</p>
    <p>The ini­tial net prop­erty in­come yield is es­ti­mated to be 4 per cent, tak­ing into ac­count rental sup­port.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the di­vest­ment, Kep­pel Land, which is the prop­erty arm of Kep­pel Cor­po­ra­tion and spon­sor of Kep­pel Reit, will con­tinue to be the prop­erty man­ager of Kep­pel Bay Tower.</p>
    <p>The gain from this trans­ac­tion for Kep­pel Corp is es­ti­mated to be about $14.6 mil­lion, in­clud­ing fair value ad­just­ment to be recog­nised in the sec­ond half of this year.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Corp ex­pects to re­ceive net pro­ceeds of about $597 mil­lion from the pro­posed di­vest­ment, af­ter de­duct­ing costs and ex­penses. The net pro­ceeds will be used for work­ing cap­i­tal and/or busi­ness ex­pan­sion of the group.</p>
    <p>“The di­vest­ment of Kep­pel Bay Tower is in line with Kep­pel’s Vi­sion 2030 and will al­low the Kep­pel group to un­lock cap­i­tal from Kep­pel Bay Tower and re­al­lo­cate it to seek new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties,” said Mr Ng Ooi Hooi, pres­i­dent for Sin­ga­pore at Kep­pel Land.</p>
    <p>“Through Kep­pel Land’s in­ter­est in Kep­pel Reit, Kep­pel Land will con­tinue to en­joy the rental in­come and po­ten­tial cap­i­tal value ap­pre­ci­a­tion of Kep­pel Bay Tower, as well as ben­e­fit from the growth of the Reit.”</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Bay Tower is a Grade A of­fice build­ing in the Kep­pel Bay water­front precinct in the Har­bourFront area. It has a to­tal net let­table area of about 386,600 sq ft, and com­prises an 18-storey tower as well as a six-storey podium block. As at the end of Septem­ber,</p>
    <p>the com­mit­ted oc­cu­pancy stood at 99.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>As the ac­qui­si­tion is an in­ter­ested party trans­ac­tion, it will be sub­ject to the ap­proval of Kep­pel Reit unit hold­ers at an extraordin­ary gen­eral meet­ing, which is ex­pected to be held in the first quar­ter of next year. If ap­proved, the ac­qui­si­tion is ex­pected to be com­pleted in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate ex­change fil­ing yes­ter­day, Kep­pel Corp said Kep­pel Off­shore & Ma­rine (Kep­pel O&M) had com­plied with its obli­ga­tions un­der the De­ferred Pros­e­cu­tion Agree­ment (DPA) en­tered into with the US Depart­ment of Jus­tice in De­cem­ber 2017. The DPA has ac­cord­ingly con­cluded.</p>
    <p>This was in re­la­tion to a global res­o­lu­tion with the crim­i­nal au­thor­i­ties i n the United States, Brazil and Sin­ga­pore in con­nec­tion with cor­rupt pay­ments made by a for­mer agent in Brazil.</p>
    <p>As part of fines un­der the res­o­lu­tion, about US$52.8 mil­lion (S$70.4 mil­lion) was payable to the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau (CPIB) in Sin­ga­pore within three years from the date of a con­di­tional warn­ing, less any penal­ties that Kep­pel O&M may pay to spec­i­fied Brazil­ian au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions with the Brazil­ian au­thor­i­ties con­tinue, and CPIB has agreed to ex­tend the three-year pe­riod by 12 months un­til Dec 22 next year, Kep­pel Corp said, not­ing that the sum has been in­cluded in ac­crued ex­penses since FY2017.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Corp shares closed at $5.37 yes­ter­day, up 1.32 per cent. Units of Kep­pel Reit were down 0.9 per cent to $1.10.</p>
