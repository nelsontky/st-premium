    <p>The re­port on the prin­ci­pal who mo­lested boys in his school is truly fright­ful (Ex-prin­ci­pal pleads guilty to mo­lest­ing three boys at his school, Aug 29).</p>
    <p>Th­ese teens have suf­fered trauma. The au­thor­ity fig­ure who was sup­posed to pro­vide guid­ance and make them feel safe vi­o­lated their trust.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ably, the av­er­age school coun­sel­lor may not be equipped to han­dle the af­ter-care of th­ese teens.</p>
    <p>I hope an inter-min­istry team can over­see such in­ci­dents and fol­low up by re­fer­ring vic­tims to reli­gious or so­cial agen­cies, even not-for-profit groups that work with at-risk youth.</p>
    <p>The teens in this case were de­scribed as at-risk and had dis­ci­plinary is­sues, which was what landed them in the prin­ci­pal’s of­fice, where the of­fences oc­curred.</p>
    <p>We need to step up and look into the wel­fare of such teens who are al­ready of­ten disad­van­taged due to their fam­ily back­grounds.</p>
