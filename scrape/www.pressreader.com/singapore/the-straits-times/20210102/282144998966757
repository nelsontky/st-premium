    <p>Mr Liu Fengfeng had more than a decade un­der his belt at one of the world’s most prom­i­nent tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies be­fore he re­alised where the real gold rush in China was tak­ing place.</p>
    <p>Com­puter chips are the brains and souls of all the elec­tron­ics the coun­try’s fac­to­ries crank out. Yet they are mostly de­signed and pro­duced over­seas. China’s govern­ment is lav­ish­ing money on any­one who can help change that.</p>
    <p>So in 2019, Mr Liu, 40, left his job at Fox­conn, the Tai­wanese gi­ant that as­sem­bles iPhones in China for Ap­ple.</p>
    <p>He found a niche – high-end films and ad­he­sives for chip prod­ucts – and quickly raised</p>
    <p>US$5 mil­lion (S$6.6 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>To­day, his start-up has 36 em­ploy­ees, most of them in the tech hub of Shen­zhen, and is aim­ing to start mass pro­duc­tion this year.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore, you might have had to beg Grandpa and call on Grandma for money,” Mr Liu said. “Now, you just have a few con­ver­sa­tions, and ev­ery­one is hop­ing projects get started as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>China is in the midst of a mass mo­bil­i­sa­tion for chip mas­tery, a quest whose aims can seem just as hare­brained and im­pos­si­ble – at least un­til they are achieved – as send­ing rovers to the Moon or dom­i­nat­ing Olympic gold medals.</p>
    <p>In ev­ery cor­ner of the coun­try, in­vestors, en­trepreneur­s and lo­cal of­fi­cials are in a frenzy to build up semi­con­duc­tor abil­i­ties, re­spond­ing to a call from Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping to rely less on the out­side world in key tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Their ef­forts are start­ing to pay off. China re­mains far from host­ing real ri­vals to US chip gi­ants like In­tel and Nvidia, and its semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ers are at least four years be­hind the lead­ing edge in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Still, lo­cal com­pa­nies are ex­pand­ing their abil­ity to meet the coun­try’s needs, par­tic­u­larly for prod­ucts such as smart ap­pli­ances and elec­tric ve­hi­cles that have more mod­est re­quire­ments than su­per­com­put­ers and high-end smart­phones.</p>
    <p>The tur­bocharged chip push could prove to be one of the most en­dur­ing lega­cies of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s pugilis­tic trade poli­cies to­wards China. By turn­ing the coun­try’s de­pen­dence on for­eign chips into a cud­gel for at­tack­ing com­pa­nies like Huawei, the US ad­min­is­tra­tion made Chi­nese busi­ness and po­lit­i­cal lead­ers re­solve never to be caught out that way again.</p>
    <p>But as Bei­jing broad­ens its am­bi­tions in semi­con­duc­tors, it is also set­ting it­self up for larger po­ten­tial fail­ures – and di­alling up the amount of money it might lose in the process.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral chip projects have run aground re­cently be­cause of frozen fund­ing and mis­man­age­ment. A state-backed chip con­glom­er­ate, Ts­inghua Un­i­group, warned last month that it was in dan­ger of de­fault­ing on nearly US$2.5 bil­lion in in­ter­na­tional bonds.</p>
    <p>In a way, China is hop­ing to achieve the same kind of lift-off that helped it progress from mak­ing plas­tic toys to craft­ing so­lar pan­els.</p>
    <p>With semi­con­duc­tors, though, “the model starts to break down a lit­tle bit”, said tech in­dus­try con­sul­tant Jay Gold­berg, a for­mer ex­ec­u­tive at Qual­comm.</p>
    <p>The tech­nol­ogy is eye-wa­ter­ingly ex­pen­sive to develop, and es­tab­lished play­ers have spent decades ac­cu­mu­lat­ing know-how.</p>
    <p>Europe, Mr Gold­berg noted, once had many “in­cred­i­ble” chip com­pa­nies. Ja­pan’s chip­mak­ers are lead­ers in cer­tain spe­cialised prod­ucts, but few would call them bold in­no­va­tors.</p>
    <p>“My point is, there is a ladder – China’s mov­ing up it,” Mr</p>
    <p>Gold­berg said. But it’s “un­clear which out­come they go to”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s re­cent love of chips be­gan with the cre­ation of a gi­ant, chip-fo­cused in­vest­ment fund in 2014. The govern­ment set a lofty goal: China would pro­duce 40 per cent of the chips it con­sumed by last year. That didn’t hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Mor­gan Stan­ley an­a­lysts es­ti­mate that Chi­nese brands bought US$103 bil­lion in semi­con­duc­tors in 2019, of which 17 per cent was from lo­cal ven­dors. They pre­dict the share will rise to 40 per cent in 2025, far short of the govern­ment’s 70 per cent tar­get.</p>
    <p>China has charged ahead with re­newed ur­gency be­cause of the US as­sault on Huawei, the Chi­nese tech cham­pion, which has been choked off from buy­ing US chips or even chips made us­ing US soft­ware and tools.</p>
    <p>The US Com­merce Depart­ment re­cently im­posed sim­i­lar curbs on ex­ports to China’s most ad­vanced chip man­u­fac­turer, Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Corp, cit­ing con­cerns over its mil­i­tary ties. SMIC has de­nied its prod­ucts have any mil­i­tary use.</p>
    <p>And so, China has rolled out new tax breaks for chips, in­clud­ing a 10-year ex­emp­tion from cor­po­rate tax and duty-free im­ports of ma­te­ri­als. State-backed funds have in­vested in both start-ups and pub­licly traded com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing when SMIC listed shares in Shang­hai in July.</p>
    <p>At a top-level meet­ing on the econ­omy last month, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s lead­ers en­shrined tech­no­log­i­cal self-re­liance as one of the coun­try’s “Five Fun­da­men­tals” for eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Com­plete self-suf­fi­ciency in chips, how­ever, would mean recre­at­ing ev­ery part of the lengthy sup­ply chains for some of the most com­plex tech­nol­ogy on earth – a mis­sion that would seem to lead, if not to mad­ness, then at least to waste.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an anal­y­sis by China Eco­nomic Weekly, a mag­a­zine af­fil­i­ated with the Com­mu­nist Party’s of­fi­cial news­pa­per, Peo­ple’s Daily, the num­ber of chip-re­lated com­pa­nies in China climbed by 58,000 be­tween Jan­uary and Oc­to­ber last year, or roughly 200 a day.</p>
    <p>Some of these, the mag­a­zine noted, were in Ti­bet – not a place tra­di­tion­ally as­so­ci­ated with cut­ting-edge tech.</p>
    <p>“Up un­til very re­cently... the goal had been: With state back­ing, move up the value chain, spe­cialise where China has a com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage, but don’t re­ally try and fall down the rab­bit hole of try­ing to build every­thing your­self,” said Mr Jimmy Goodrich, vice-pres­i­dent for global pol­icy at the Semi­con­duc­tor In­dus­try As­so­ci­a­tion, a group that rep­re­sents US chip firms. Now,</p>
    <p>“it’s very clear that Xi Jin­ping is call­ing for a re­dun­dant do­mes­tic sup­ply chain”, he said. “And so the rules of eco­nomics, com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage and the sup­ply-chain ef­fi­cien­cies have ba­si­cally been thrown out the door.”</p>
    <p>The govern­ment is con­scious of the dan­gers. State-run news out­lets have am­ply cov­ered the re­cent semi­con­duc­tor flame-outs.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage to other up­starts: Don’t mess it up.</p>
    <p>When the state broad­caster China Cen­tral Tele­vi­sion vis­ited one stalled project in the east­ern city of Huai’an re­cently, it found dozens of gi­ant ma­chines idling on the fac­tory floor, many of them still sheathed in plas­tic. “There have been some stun­ning ab­sur­di­ties that defy logic and com­mon sense,” China Eco­nomic Weekly said.</p>
    <p>Yet there has also been progress. Two com­pa­nies – Yangtze Mem­ory Tech­nolo­gies and ChangXin Mem­ory Tech­nolo­gies –</p>
    <p>are gear­ing up to put China on the map in mem­ory chips, which store data.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal man­u­fac­tur­ers of logic chips, which per­form com­pu­ta­tions, are ex­pand­ing pro­duc­tion, largely for Chi­nese cus­tomers. Those man­u­fac­tur­ers might not have much choice but to serve do­mes­tic clients.</p>
    <p>Some multi­na­tional chip­mak­ers are start­ing to think twice about work­ing with Chi­nese sup­pli­ers and part­ners out of con­cerns about in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft, said Credit Suisse’s tech an­a­lyst Randy Abrams. “In­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies are be­com­ing more wary about the IP (in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty) leak­age in China,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu, the start-up founder in Shen­zhen, does not deny be­ing mo­ti­vated by a cer­tain pa­tri­otic pur­pose. Em­bla­zoned atop the web­site for his com­pany, Ts­inghon, is a proud ref­er­ence to the Mao-era project that pro­duced China’s first atomic bomb, bal­lis­tic mis­sile and satel­lite: “In­herit the Spirit of ‘Two Bombs, One Satel­lite’. Be Self-Re­liant and Bold in Forg­ing Ahead.”</p>
    <p>The en­tre­pre­neur said the sense of na­tional mis­sion does not con­flict with his work serv­ing cus­tomers and putting out com­pet­i­tive prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>He does ac­knowl­edge, when he looks at the sky-high val­u­a­tions for some chip start-ups, that ir­ra­tional­ity has crept into the mar­ket. “There is def­i­nitely a bub­ble in China,” he said. “But you can’t over-gen­er­alise.”</p>
    <p>The govern­ment, he said, is try­ing to hold the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties more ac­count­able for bad in­vest­ments. And the tor­rent of money might at least per­suade more skilled en­gi­neers in China to work on chips in­stead of video games and food de­liv­ery apps.</p>
    <p>“Some­thing is bound to ac­cu­mu­late, whether it’s equip­ment, tal­ent or fac­to­ries, right?” Mr Liu said. “If not you or the other guy, then it will be some­one else who ends up us­ing it. I think this might be the govern­ment’s logic.”</p>
