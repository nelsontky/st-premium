    <p>This is the 12th in</p>
    <p>The Straits Times se­ries by Se­nior Law Cor­re­spon­dent</p>
    <p>K.C. Vi­jayan on le­gal is­sues, with each edi­tion tied to an area of law. To­day’s edi­tion looks at prospects in the wake of Covid-19 and fea­tures some lo­cal lawyers who shine abroad. Also, an in­au­gu­ral AskST ques­tion is ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>Even as a vaccine year fol­lows the pan­demic year that passed, Covid-19 will con­tinue to shape the le­gal land­scape and bring both op­por­tu­ni­ties and chal­lenges, say lawyers.</p>
    <p>While cer­tain prac­tice ar­eas like con­trac­tual dis­putes could see a rise in vol­ume of work, oth­ers like cross-bor­der deals may turn south.</p>
    <p>“No doubt 2021 will bring more chal­lenges but the les­sons learnt in 2020 will be of great help,” said Se­nior Coun­sel Cavin­der Bull, Drew & Napier’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Helms­man LLC’s man­ag­ing direc­tor Ian Teo ex­pects the gen­eral slow­down in le­gal work in Sin­ga­pore, es­pe­cially in trans­ac­tional and non-dis­putes work, to con­tinue this year.</p>
    <p>“Many com­pa­nies have been af­fected by Covid-19. Even those that were not sig­nif­i­cantly af­fected are adopt­ing a con­ser­va­tive out­look for 2021. Many com­pa­nies have post­poned or can­celled ex­pan­sion plans and large-scale projects. This means a slow­down in terms of work for the fi­nanc­ing and cor­po­rate law sec­tor,” said Mr Teo, who is also a se­nior ac­cred­ited ship­ping and mar­itime law spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>He noted a rise in work on dis­putes, which he ex­pects to con­tinue this year. “Due to the mar­ket con­di­tions, con­trac­tual de­faults are in­creas­ing. This means more dis­putes,” he said.</p>
    <p>“At Helms­man LLC, be­ing a dis­putes-ori­ented firm, our work vol­ume re­mains healthy... in part due to the re­cent up­heavals in the com­mod­ity trad­ing and ship­ping mar­ket both in and out of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, the clo­sures of ports world­wide caused many dis­putes in ship­ping and com­modi­ties con­tracts... we man­aged to cap­ture a fair amount of dis­putes work in these dif­fi­cult times. How­ever, as our clients are tight­en­ing their belts, we as lawyers are ex­pected to work with them to re­duce un­nec­es­sary le­gal ex­pen­di­ture.”</p>
    <p>Law So­ci­ety pres­i­dent Gre­gory Vi­jayen­dran be­lieves the growth ar­eas for le­gal prac­tice would in­clude restruc­tur­ing, in­sol­vency and reg­u­la­tory com­pli­ance, as well as a pos­si­ble con­tin­u­ing spurt in con­veyanc­ing prac­tice.</p>
    <p>He said: “As for the down­sides, lawyers are ser­vice providers. If cor­po­rate deals, a func­tion of mar­ket ac­tiv­ity, are not pick­ing up or not pick­ing up rapidly due to eco­nomic con­di­tions, there is less work to go around.</p>
    <p>“Like­wise, un­til travel re­stric­tions are fully lifted, there will con­tinue to be a detri­men­tal im­pact on cross-bor­der trans­ac­tions be­ing con­sum­mated. In Asia, a lot de­pends on re­la­tion­ships and trust be­tween busi­ness per­sons on both sides of the trans­ac­tions. There is a world of dif­fer­ence hav­ing busi­ness meet­ings in per­son as against do­ing on­line meet­ings.”</p>
    <p>SC Bull said “the op­por­tu­nity for</p>
    <p>growth in 2021 is there for those who are brave enough to seize it”. He added that “the key is to un­der­stand that our clients’ needs have evolved with the pan­demic, and adapt­ing quickly to con­tinue to de­liver qual­ity le­gal ser­vices in a changed en­vi­ron­ment”.</p>
    <p>He said Drew & Napier in­creased its lawyer num­bers and launched its re­gional Drew Net­work Asia last year de­spite the firm ad­just­ing to a higher level of telecom­mut­ing then. “So growth is pos­si­ble even in this chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment. Em­brac­ing change and util­is­ing tech­nol­ogy have been key,” he added.</p>
    <p>NUS law fac­ulty dean Si­mon Ch­ester­man un­der­lined the value of lawyers dur­ing the pan­demic, hail­ing the dif­fer­ences they made dur­ing such try­ing times, say­ing: “Lawyers en­sured that the eco­nomic pain is dis­trib­uted fairly, that health ser­vices and the com­ing vaccine will be shared eq­ui­tably, and that emer­gency sur­veil­lance pow­ers rolled out around the world are lim­ited to the ex­tent and for the du­ra­tion truly nec­es­sary.</p>
