    <p>JAKARTA • In­done­sia’s po­lice have de­tained thou­sands of pro­test­ers against a newly passed om­nibus law, ac­cord­ing to state news agency An­tara, amid con­cern that the gath­er­ings could worsen the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Of the 3,862 peo­ple de­tained, 145 have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, An­tara re­ported, cit­ing po­lice spokesman Argo Yu­wono.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents and work­ers held strikes and protests across the coun­try last week to re­ject the new law aimed at cut­ting red tape to boost in­vest­ments, say­ing the leg­is­la­tion would erode labour rights and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo de­fended the law, say­ing the protests were fu­elled by “dis­in­for­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>He said the coun­try needs the sweep­ing “om­nibus” job cre­ation law to pro­vide em­ploy­ment for its young pop­u­la­tion and those un­em­ployed due to the eco­nomic cri­sis brought about by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I saw demon­stra­tions against the Job Cre­ation Law that were ba­si­cally mo­ti­vated by dis­in­for­ma­tion,” he said, urg­ing crit­ics to chal­lenge the law at the Con­sti­tu­tional Court if they dis­agreed with its con­tent.</p>
    <p>The world’s fourth-most pop­u­lous coun­try is strug­gling to con­tain the pan­demic, adding more than 4,000 cases daily, with a record of 4,850 last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of con­firmed coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in the coun­try has tripled from the end of July to 328,952 yes­ter­day and there have been 11,765 deaths.</p>
    <p>The spread could be aided by poor un­der­stand­ing of the dis­ease, with 17 out of 100 In­done­sians say­ing it is un­likely they would catch the virus, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey last month by the sta­tis­tics bureau.</p>
