    <p>Olympic-bound gym­nast Tan Sze En’s prepa­ra­tions for the Tokyo Games re­main on track de­spite the res­ig­na­tion of na­tional coach Ger­rit Belt­man a year be­fore the event. Mr Belt­man made a fam­ily-based de­ci­sion to re­sign this month, with his de­par­ture said to be un­re­lated to his re­cent ad­mis­sion that he had pre­vi­ously “mis­treated and hu­mil­i­ated young gym­nasts to win medals”.</p>
    <p>Na­tional gym­nast Tan Sze En may have lost her coach a year be­fore the Tokyo Olympics, but the 19-year-old stressed that the de­par­ture of for­mer na­tional coach Ger­rit Belt­man will not sig­nif­i­cantly af­fect her prepa­ra­tions for the resched­uled Games.</p>
    <p>Call­ing the Dutch­man’s res­ig­na­tion a loss for Sin­ga­pore Gym­nas­tics (SG), she said: “Tech­nique­wise, he was a great coach and he pushed us to be the best that we could be with­out com­pro­mis­ing our health or safety.</p>
    <p>“I felt com­fort­able com­mu­ni­cat­ing my needs and thoughts about the train­ing plan or any in­juries I had and I trusted that he would lis­ten to what I was say­ing and make the nec­es­sary ad­just­ments.”</p>
    <p>Tan, who un­der­went wrist surgery two weeks ago, is not un­duly wor­ried as her train­ing and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion is now be­ing man­aged by SG gen­eral man­ager Karen Nor­den and its sport psy­chol­o­gist Joyce Koh.</p>
    <p>The Stan­ford Univer­sity stu­dent told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “It will be about 10 more weeks be­fore I start weight bear­ing and by that time I should be at my univer­sity train­ing with my col­lege coaches.”</p>
    <p>Belt­man, who joined SG as head coach of the women’s artis­tic gym­nas­tics team last Au­gust, re­signed on July 17 to re­turn to the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>The 64-year-old had re­cently ad­mit­ted to hav­ing pre­vi­ously “mis­treated and hu­mil­i­ated young gym­nasts to win medals”.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that the in­ci­dents took place in Bel­gium, where he was na­tional coach from 2002 to 2008, and the Nether­lands, where he pre­vi­ously led the Dutch na­tional ju­nior team.</p>
    <p>Nor­den had ear­lier told ST that his de­par­ture was a fam­ily-based de­ci­sion and “un­re­lated to the sto­ries of abuse”.</p>
    <p>Tan, who earned her ticket to Tokyo at last Oc­to­ber’s World Cham­pi­onships, is now fo­cused on mak­ing a full re­cov­ery while main­tain­ing her lower body strength.</p>
    <p>“When I’m back in the gym, I hope to work on my form and ex­e­cu­tion and maybe play around with in­creas­ing some dif­fi­culty,” she said.</p>
    <p>With SG on the hunt for Belt­man’s re­place­ment, the ath­letes are now guided by artis­tic pro­gramme man­ager Perry Koh and exO­lympian Lim Heem Wei, who is one of the na­tional women’s artis­tic gym­nas­tics coaches.</p>
    <p>A cou­ple of “strong can­di­dates” have ap­plied for the role, said Nor­den.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for the post closed on Mon­day and the as­so­ci­a­tion ex­pects to go through the fi­nal process of re­cruit­ment within the next month.</p>
    <p>Nor­den said: “A few of the can­di­dates that we have re­ceived to date have the ex­pe­ri­ence re­quired, but more im­por­tantly, they have in­di­cated they have a pas­sion for cre­at­ing a safe en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“But in say­ing that we still have a long way to go in the re­cruit­ment process, en­sur­ing our hu­man re­source pro­cesses are rig­or­ous, due dili­gence is taken and it is in line with our child com­mit­ment state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The process will not be rushed or com­pro­mised. We want some­one who is aligned and wants the pos­i­tive cul­ture, where ath­letes are re­spected and that their health and well-be­ing a pri­or­ity.”</p>
    <p>RE­PLACE­MENT NEEDED</p>
    <p>Tech­nique-wise, he was a great coach and he pushed us to be the best that we could be with­out com­pro­mis­ing our health or safety. ’’</p>
