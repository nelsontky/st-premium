    <p>Af­ter months of hag­gling, Euro­pean Union lead­ers agreed to launch the “eurobond”. But cel­e­bra­tions would be pre­ma­ture as the res­cue pack­age may not be enough to help those worst hit by the Covid-19 cri­sis, says as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Vikram Khanna (be­low).</p>
    <p>The lead­ers of the Euro­pean Union have a well-de­served rep­u­ta­tion of tak­ing tough but es­sen­tial de­ci­sions only dur­ing times of cri­sis, and they have lived up to it yet again.</p>
    <p>On July 21, af­ter months of ran­corous hag­gling, they agreed to launch what is ef­fec­tively a eurobond – that is, a bond that would be is­sued by the EU it­self, rather than by its in­di­vid­ual mem­ber gov­ern­ments. Up till then, the EU didn’t be­lieve in tak­ing col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity for the debt bur­dens of its in­di­vid­ual mem­bers – every coun­try was re­spon­si­ble for its own debts. But that has changed – at least par­tially and tem­porar­ily.</p>
    <p>The cat­a­lyst for this his­toric U-turn is the eco­nomic cri­sis caused by Covid-19, which is Europe’s worst since World War II, sur­pass­ing even the euro zone debt cri­sis of 2012, which brought the 19-mem­ber group­ing to the brink of col­lapse.</p>
    <p>In its June fore­casts, the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund</p>
    <p>(IMF) pro­jected that the econ­omy of the euro area – the sec­ond largest in the world – will shrink by 10.2 per cent this year, the worst con­trac­tion for any ma­jor econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But what com­pounds the prob­lem is that the eco­nomic shock will be asym­met­ric: While every mem­ber coun­try has been af­fected, some are hit far worse than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Among them are the two large economies of Italy and Spain, both of which the IMF projects will con­tract by 12.8 per cent this year. Their public debts are also al­ready enor­mous at more than 125 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP).</p>
    <p>By con­trast, Ger­many and the Nether­lands, for ex­am­ple, will take not only a smaller hit to growth, but also have rel­a­tively low lev­els of public debt and en­joy large trade sur­pluses – which means they are far bet­ter placed to weather the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The bet­ter-off euro coun­tries could tell the likes of Italy and Spain that they would have to be re­spon­si­ble for their own debts – just as they did dur­ing the euro zone debt cri­sis to Greece, which was forced to shoul­der its huge debt bur­den on its own and put through a dra­co­nian eco­nomic aus­ter­ity pro­gramme that in­cluded wage cuts and tax in­creases.</p>
    <p>But the sit­u­a­tion to­day is very dif­fer­ent. Not only is this cri­sis far worse, but Italy and Spain are not Greece. Italy’s econ­omy is al­most 10 times as large, while Spain’s is more than six times big­ger.</p>
    <p>More­over, in the face of a de­fla­tion­ary col­lapse, aus­ter­ity is not an op­tion. Italy and Spain (like other EU mem­bers) are go­ing to have to dra­mat­i­cally ex­pand their public debt to keep their economies afloat. They would find it hard, if not im­pos­si­ble, to ser­vice that debt on their own.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of any trans­fers from bet­ter-off EU mem­bers, they would be con­demned to a pro­longed de­pres­sion that could set off so­cial un­rest and a lurch to even more na­tion­al­ist pol­i­tics. Pres­sures would build within these coun­tries to leave the euro zone; as it is, a ma­jor­ity of Ital­ians are al­ready in­clined to do so. The mere threat of an “Italexit” would heighten the dan­ger of the break-up of the euro zone and in­sta­bil­ity across the EU.</p>
    <p>The only way that dan­ger can be averted is through a mech­a­nism like the eurobond which would share the bur­den faced by the worst-hit coun­tries – which also in­clude France. Dr Ya­nis Varo­ufakis, who was the Greek fi­nance min­is­ter dur­ing the worst of the euro zone debt cri­sis, put it starkly when he said re­cently: “With­out a eurobond, the euro zone has no fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>COL­LEC­TIVE RES­CUE PACK­AGE</p>
    <p>See­ing the writ­ing on the wall, in an act of states­man­ship in the twi­light of her po­lit­i­cal ca­reer, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel – pre­vi­ously staunchly op­posed to eu­robonds – or­ches­trated a col­lec­tive res­cue pack­age, to­gether with French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion (EC) pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen.</p>
    <p>Its of­fi­cial name is not a eurobond but a “next gen­er­a­tion EU re­cov­ery plan”. But it has the key char­ac­ter­is­tic of a eurobond in that the EC would bor­row di­rectly on fi­nan­cial mar­kets, which means the bur­den of re­pay­ment would be shared by all its 27 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Much hag­gling – and prob­a­bly some arm-twist­ing – was needed be­fore the pack­age was fi­nally agreed. Much of the re­sis­tance came from the so-called “fru­gal four” com­pris­ing the Nether­lands, Aus­tria, Swe­den and Den­mark (but sig­nif­i­cantly, not Ger­many). While not to­tally op­posed to the idea, they wanted a smaller pack­age with a higher pro­por­tion of loans com­pared with grants and the right to mon­i­tor how the money is spent.</p>
    <p>They man­aged to get some of what they asked for. While the size of the pack­age re­mained at</p>
    <p>€750 bil­lion (S$1,215 bil­lion) as orig­i­nally planned, the por­tion to be ex­tended as grants (on which no in­ter­est will be due) was cut from €500 bil­lion to €390 bil­lion, while the amount com­pris­ing loans was in­creased to €360 bil­lion from €250 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The fru­gal four also se­cured the right to call out any misuse of funds by the re­cip­i­ents, which could lead to a de­nial of fund­ing, and even got some ex­tra re­bates on their con­tri­bu­tions to the EU – all of which would mol­lify their elec­torates who were broadly op­posed to the idea of sub­si­dis­ing prof­li­gate south­ern Euro­peans.</p>
    <p>EU politi­cians are spin­ning the re­cov­ery plan as a win-win all around. The likes of Italy and Spain will win some breath­ing room to ser­vice their debts and neu­tralise ris­ing anti-EU sen­ti­ment at home, while the oth­ers will ben­e­fit from a union that is more eco­nom­i­cally and po­lit­i­cally sta­ble.</p>
    <p>PRE­MA­TURE TO CEL­E­BRATE</p>
    <p>While all of this is plau­si­ble, any cel­e­bra­tions would be pre­ma­ture.</p>
    <p>Apart from the fact that the pack­age still needs to be ap­proved by the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment, it suf­fers from at least three flaws.</p>
    <p>One is that it is too small. Italy’s public debt is ex­pected to soar to at least 160 per cent of GDP by the end of this year, a fig­ure about 30 per­cent­age points larger than what trig­gered its sov­er­eign debt cri­sis in 2012.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian gov­ern­ment projects the coun­try’s bud­get deficit this year at 11.6 per cent of GDP, which would bring it close to €200 bil­lion. Next year it is likely to have an­other large deficit. On top of that, Italy has more than €650 bil­lion worth of gov­ern­ment bonds ma­tur­ing over the next two years. This means that Italy’s fund­ing needs alone will be around €1 tril­lion over the next cou­ple of years.</p>
    <p>Spain will also need a few hun­dred bil­lion and there are other coun­tries that would need ex­tra help. Even tak­ing into ac­count the EU’s pro­posed €1 tril­lion bud­get that will run from next year to 2027, the new €750 bil­lion pack­age – al­most half of which will be in the form of loans – will not be any­where near suf­fi­cient to plug the fund­ing gaps across the EU.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond prob­lem is that the eurobond-funded pack­age is one-off and time-lim­ited, aimed only at help­ing coun­tries cope with the cri­sis brought on by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But the eco­nomic dam­age wrought by the cri­sis will take sev­eral years to undo. More fund­ing will al­most cer­tainly be needed be­yond the 2023 time­frame set out in the pack­age. This is why some ob­servers, such as hedge fund man­ager Ge­orge Soros, have called on the EU to is­sue per­pet­ual bonds, which are not time-lim­ited and on which only in­ter­est would need to be paid.</p>
    <p>The third flaw is the con­di­tions at­tached to the spend­ing. As yet, the de­tails of these are vague. But if Italy and other re­cip­i­ent coun­tries spend a sub­stan­tial part of the funds that they re­ceive on wel­fare, pen­sions and sub­si­dies – as is likely to be the case – this could trig­ger ob­jec­tions from the fru­gal four and oth­ers, lead­ing to more in­tra-EU ran­cour in the fu­ture and a pos­si­ble in­ter­rup­tion in fund­ing.</p>
    <p>STILL NO FIS­CAL SOL­I­DAR­ITY</p>
    <p>So the is­sue of eu­robonds in the half­way-house form as agreed is still far from be­ing the EU’s “Hamil­to­nian mo­ment” – the idea that all the EU’s debts will be mu­tu­alised, as were those of the United States in 1790 when Trea­sury sec­re­tary Alexan­der Hamil­ton de­cided to na­tion­alise all 13 state-level debts af­ter the war of in­de­pen­dence against Bri­tain, thus lay­ing the foun­da­tions for a na­tional fis­cal pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The so­lu­tion the EU has pro­duced only buys time. Italy and other heav­ily in­debted coun­tries will still be on the hook for most of what they owe. If their debts are un­sus­tain­able (as Italy’s are) and un­share­able, there is still a high chance of a fu­ture sov­er­eign debt cri­sis that would dwarf that of 2012. The dan­ger of Italy crash­ing out of the euro zone be­cause other mem­bers refuse to share its fu­ture debts has still not gone away.</p>
    <p>While the de­ci­sion to is­sue a eurobond is of great sym­bolic im­por­tance in that it breaks the long­stand­ing taboo in the bloc against col­lec­tive fis­cal re­spon­si­bil­ity in prin­ci­ple, the EU still has a long way to go be­fore it achieves true fis­cal sol­i­dar­ity.</p>
    <p>It will take yet an­other cri­sis – which is likely – for its politi­cians to take a fur­ther step for­ward to defuse the debt bomb that is still tick­ing in south­ern Europe.</p>
