    <p>While the new Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion may have more mul­ti­lat­er­al­ists who sup­port world trade, it is not clear if it will be any keener than the cur­rent one on hav­ing the United States throw its trade doors wide open, or join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP) trade pact, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>The at­ti­tude of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion so far, he added, has been that trade is a win-lose propo­si­tion: “If I have a trade sur­plus with you, that is good for me. If I have a trade deficit with you, that is bad for me.”</p>
    <p>But trade is not like that, PM Lee said yesterday at a virtual meet­ing associated with the Asi­aPa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) group­ing. “Trade is win­win – I may have a sur­plus with you, I have a deficit with some­body else, but it does not mat­ter as long as over­all, it bal­ances out.”</p>
    <p>But that has not been the view of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, which “is still in charge un­til Jan 20”, he noted, ref­er­enc­ing the date when Mr Joe Bi­den will be in­stalled as US pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“I do not think that they are likely to change their po­si­tion at this late stage, but we will have to see how the new Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion plays it.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee was re­spond­ing to mod­er­a­tor and Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit at the Apec CEO Di­a­logues. Mr Ho had asked how Apec would be af­fected by the US elec­tion re­sults and the sign­ing of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP), the world’s largest trade pact.</p>
    <p>Both the CPTPP and RCEP are seen as build­ing blocks of a much larger free trade vi­sion span­ning the Pa­cific Ocean – The Free Trade Area of the Asia Pa­cific, which Apec mem­ber economies had al­luded to as early as 2004.</p>
    <p>One rea­son for the slow progress in Apec, PM Lee said, is that the US wants to deal with is­sues bi­lat­er­ally, rather than on a mul­ti­lat­eral ba­sis with mul­ti­ple part­ners to­gether in a group.</p>
    <p>And while the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion may be more sup­port­ive of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion and Apec, much still de­pends on do­mes­tic pol­i­tics, he added.</p>
    <p>“Once the re­stric­tions are in, it is a very del­i­cate mat­ter rethinking your po­si­tion in de­cid­ing whether you want to go back to where you were, or how do you move for­ward.”</p>
    <p>He called the RCEP, which was signed last Sun­day, a “big step for­ward” and that it sends an im­por­tant sig­nal that coun­tries in Asia do want to deepen re­gional in­te­gra­tion, free up trade fur­ther, and are de­ter­mined to work to­gether and pros­per to­gether as a group.</p>
    <p>While there has been dis­ap­point­ment over In­dia’s with­drawal last year, it is the hope that one day, it</p>
    <p>will re­join, PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause it makes strate­gic sense for (In­dia) and I think in the long term, it makes eco­nomic sense for them too. But they have po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions, and I can un­der­stand that.”</p>
    <p>In­dia had trade deficits with 11 of the 15 RCEP mem­bers and had feared the deal would re­sult in</p>
    <p>cheap man­u­fac­tur­ing and agri­cul­tural prod­ucts flood­ing its do­mes­tic mar­ket.</p>
    <p>U.S.-CHINA RE­LA­TIONS</p>
    <p>PM Lee said at­ti­tudes in both the US and China have hard­ened a lot in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Many in the US see China as a strate­gic threat, while China</p>
    <p>thinks the US is out to thwart its devel­op­ment and rise.</p>
    <p>But he ex­pressed hope that the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will take “a more co­her­ent, sys­tem­atic ap­proach – one which will take into ac­count a broader range of US in­ter­ests, not just a trade bal­ance, but also their over­all re­la­tion­ship with China and the over­all in­ter­est which the US has in the Asia-Pa­cific and in the world”.</p>
    <p>And the US will need to be seen as set­ting the stan­dard, show­ing the way and play­ing a lead­ing role as the most pow­er­ful coun­try in the world, he added.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing care of Amer­ica’s in­ter­ests does not mean hav­ing to ride roughshod over other coun­tries’ in­ter­ests,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>He also made the point that Apec is a fo­rum where is­sues can be dis­cussed and na­tions can come to­gether and work things out.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal econ­omy is one such area, he said, cit­ing the need to stan­dard­ise rules and in­tro­duce ap­pro­pri­ate reg­u­la­tions to fa­cil­i­tate in­for­ma­tion flows.</p>
    <p>Travel is also im­por­tant, and coun­tries need agree­ments on how to have green lanes and travel bub­bles, how to test for and trace the virus, and be able to ad­just the rules when cir­cum­stances change.</p>
    <p>PM Lee added: “For ex­am­ple, if you have a travel bub­ble with some­body, and then I have new cases pop up or he has new cases pop up – what do we do?”</p>
    <p>There must be some way to press the pause but­ton un­til the sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises again and things can be re­opened, he said.</p>
    <p>“These are all things which need to be dis­cussed, and I hope will be dis­cussed in Apec.”</p>
