    <p>I re­ceived with mixed emo­tions a Bud­get 2020 let­ter in­form­ing me of the sta­tus of the Sol­i­dar­ity and Care and Sup­port pay­ments made to me.</p>
    <p>I was pleased to have re­ceived the pay­outs as well as the sta­tus up­date. But I was also dis­mayed at an ap­par­ent missed op­por­tu­nity for sav­ings and pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Three pieces of A4 pa­per (one was glossy stock) were used to con­vey the in­for­ma­tion, which came in nine short lines of text in a light green rec­tan­gu­lar box mea­sur­ing 6cm by 6.3cm on the first page of the let­ter.</p>
    <p>It ap­peared to be a waste of re­sources.</p>
    <p>In­stead of spend­ing on the ma­te­ri­als, print­ing, han­dling and de­liv­ery, the au­thor­i­ties could have con­veyed the in­for­ma­tion via SMS or e-mail.</p>
    <p>The money saved could have been do­nated to the ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the SG Cares ini­tia­tive de­scribed in the let­ter.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest adding an op­tion to the na­tional MyInfo data­base al­low­ing cit­i­zens to spec­ify that they wish to have only dig­i­tal com­mu­ni­ca­tions from gov­ern­ment de­part­ments and statu­tory boards in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>I have checked my record in the data­base – my e-mail ad­dress and mo­bile num­bers are al­ready in­di­cated there. I also re­call a pre­vi­ous up­date via SMS on the sta­tus of my Sol­i­dar­ity Pay­ment.</p>
    <p>My let­ter ar­rived with three other iden­ti­cal ones in the mail­box, as there are four adults liv­ing in my home. We would rather have re­ceived the in­for­ma­tion dig­i­tally.</p>
