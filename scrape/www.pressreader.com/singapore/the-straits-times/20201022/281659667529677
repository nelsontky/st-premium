    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has dropped from four in the week be­fore to two in the past week. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has risen from none in the week be­fore to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>There were 12 new coron­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,933.</p>
    <p>All of them were asymp­to­matic. The cases were all im­ported and com­prised nine work per­mit hold­ers, two de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers and one short-term visit pass holder, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) last night.</p>
    <p>The nine work per­mit hold­ers had re­turned from In­done­sia, Myan­mar and the Philip­pines, while the two de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers came back from the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>The short-term visit pass holder ar­rived from Egypt for his up­com­ing mar­riage to his Sin­ga­porean fi­ancee.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases had been placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases. No new lo­ca­tions vis­ited by in­fec­tious pa­tients and no new clus­ters were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has dropped from four in the week be­fore to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has risen from none in the week be­fore to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>With two cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,806 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 43 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 41 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
