    <p>Am­a­teurs and pro­fes­sion­als use some­what sim­i­lar equip­ment for al­to­gether dif­fer­ent pur­poses. We hope­fully flog a ball, they play cal­cu­lated golf, which is the same word turned in­side out. We re­coil from sand, the pros oc­ca­sion­ally aim for bunkers. We are sep­a­rated al­ways by de­grees of dif­fi­culty.</p>
    <p>And so when the Novem­ber Masters an­nounced it would have a two-tee start (1st and 10th holes) on the first two days, am­a­teurs may have flinched. Imag­ine be­gin­ning day one on the 495-yard par­four 10th which is his­tor­i­cally ranked the tough­est hole and has an av­er­age score of 4.31?</p>
    <p>It’s of­fi­cially called Camel­lia but it’s like play­ing with cac­tus. Ask Rory McIl­roy, who in 2011 found him­self in­spect­ing the cab­ins on his way to a triple bo­gey.</p>
    <p>Follow that with the 505-yard par-four 11th (White Dog­wood), the sec­ond-hard­est hole (av­er­age 4.29). And then end the stretch with the fourth-hard­est hole, the 12th (Golden Bell), the 155-yard, pretty par-three where a thou­sand tat­tered am­bi­tions lie at the bot­tom of Rae’s Creek (avg 3.28).</p>
    <p>The ama­teur might think, hell, we’d be five over af­ter th­ese three holes. Now what? Best to call a pro who’s played the Masters twice (2015 and 2016), fin­ished in the top 50 both times and played those three holes in even par cu­mu­la­tively across eight rounds.</p>
    <p>Hey, Anir­ban Lahiri, surely this 10th tee stuff sucks? Not quite.</p>
    <p>“For me as a pro,” says Lahiri, “I’d love to start on the 10th for then the hard­est part is quickly out of the way.”</p>
    <p>This isn’t bravado, this is tac­tics. “If you get through the 12th at even par, you’re now set to make a run. Even if you’re a cou­ple over par af­ter 12, you’ve got the 13th and</p>
    <p>This year skill will elicit only scant ad­mi­ra­tion. Ab­sent crowds will steal some of Au­gusta’s flavour, for Lahiri says un­equiv­o­cally that “of all the tour­na­ments we play state­side, Au­gusta’s pa­trons – or what­ever nomen­cla­ture you want to use – are the most in­tel­li­gent”.</p>
    <p>15th (both par fives) and so you can get to the turn and make a run.</p>
    <p>“There’s no per­fect way. You just have to change your ap­proach. As pros we’re all try­ing to play one shot at a time, but we also strate­gi­cally un­der­stand which holes to be de­fen­sive on or ag­gres­sive.</p>
    <p>“I would much rather start on No. 10 also be­cause No. 17 and No. 18 are much harder fin­ish­ing holes than the eighth or ninth. If some­one’s try­ing to make the cut, would they rather be on the 17th tee box or the eighth? I think there’s a lit­tle bit of ro­man­ti­cism in­volved here.”</p>
    <p>Talk­ing to pros is hum­bling be­cause they see the game so dif­fer­ently, read­ing more in­for­ma­tion out of greens than a palaeon­tol­o­gist can from a fos­sil. Ask Lahiri about the scary 12th, his “favourite hole” by the way, and he of­fers a neat les­son in ge­om­e­try.</p>
    <p>“It’s a very shal­low green in two parts. The left part of the green is where there is depth, on the right there is width. Let me ex­plain.</p>
    <p>“If the pin is on the left, your mar­gin of er­ror is not one of line but length. If you hit it five yards long or short it’s OK, but the line can’t be wrong. When the pin is on the right, it’s the op­po­site. Your yardage has to be spot on, go­ing left or right doesn’t mat­ter.”</p>
    <p>In 2015, Lahiri birdied the 12th and must have been met with ap­plause but this year skill will elicit only scant ad­mi­ra­tion. Ab­sent crowds will steal some of Au­gusta’s flavour, for Lahiri says un­equiv­o­cally that “of all the tour­na­ments we play state­side, Au­gusta’s pa­trons – or what­ever nomen­cla­ture you want to use – are the most in­tel­li­gent”.</p>
    <p>Thanks, Lahiri says, should be given to the Au­gusta Na­tional com­mit­tee for “be­ing so strin­gent on what flies and what doesn’t. There’s no one stand­ing be­hind the tee and say­ing ‘mashed potato’ or ‘baba booey’. They’d be out of there be­fore they could fin­ish their sen­tence”.</p>
    <p>The Masters “roar” we of­ten talk about is real not mythol­ogy and the sound is am­pli­fied by Au­gusta’s ar­chi­tec­ture. The course, ex­plains Lahiri, “is quite hilly but it’s also boxed in. It’s not ex­actly like an am­phithe­atre but with the pines and the shape of the holes, a lot of greens are sur­rounded on two sides with a lit­tle com­plex of trees. Be­hind the 11th there are just trees so a roar echoes. Be­hind the 12th also, and the 15th and 16th.”</p>
    <p>This time Au­gusta might seem like an eerie arena, stripped of noise and thus of some aura. Yet the quiet will help some. Sound car­ries pres­sure, it brings ten­sion, it cre­ates ex­pec­ta­tion and when it is silent it re­duces the de­gree of dif­fi­culty. If Tiger Woods is charg­ing on Sun­day, no leader’s knees will trem­ble be­cause no roar will rat­tle the pines.</p>
    <p>Am­a­teurs, while play­ing, never hear this roar and yet they’re the ones who cre­ate it. Ask Lahiri what’s dis­tinct about a Tiger roar and as he an­swers you know he must be smil­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s dif­fer­ent. It’s like the crowd it­self has made the putt.”</p>
