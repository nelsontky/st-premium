    <p>SEAT­TLE • Po­lice ar­rested eight peo­ple in Seat­tle after late-night demon­stra­tions and marches in the city on Tues­day, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>There were no im­me­di­ate re­ports of in­juries or that the protests were linked to the United States pres­i­den­tial election, but some demon­stra­tors car­ried “Black Lives Mat­ter” ban­ners, Q13 Fox Seat­tle television re­ported.</p>
    <p>The Seat­tle Po­lice De­part­ment said those ar­rested in­cluded a per­son who put nails on a road, and another per­son who drove over a bar­ri­cade and onto a po­lice bike lane.</p>
    <p>Two marches were held through the city’s South Lake Union and Capi­tol Hill ar­eas, with the po­lice cau­tion­ing res­i­dents trav­el­ling to those places.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said marchers had moved traf­fic bar­ri­cades onto the road, with the po­lice ini­tially is­su­ing a public safety warning and then a dis­per­sal or­der to a group of pro­test­ers at Broad­way, a ma­jor thor­ough­fare in the city.</p>
    <p>“Eight ar­rests this evening for pedes­trian in­ter­fer­ence, ob­struc­tion, as­sault on an of­fi­cer, reck­less driv­ing and crim­i­nal mischief,” Seat­tle Po­lice said on Twitter.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, Seat­tle – like else­where in the US – has seen protests against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity fol­low­ing the death in May of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, an African-Amer­i­can who died after a Min­neapo­lis po­lice of­fi­cer knelt on his neck for nearly nine min­utes. Pro­test­ers have pre­vi­ously called for po­lice re­forms.</p>
    <p>Across much of the US on Tues­day, election day un­folded smoothly in a mostly calm show of po­lit­i­cal de­ter­mi­na­tion and civic duty.</p>
