    <p>In his first com­pe­ti­tion back af­ter two years, Justyn Phoa wasted no time at the Sin­ga­pore Athletics (SA) Per­for­mance Trial 1 yes­ter­day as he broke the na­tional men’s javelin record with his ef­fort of 61.07m.</p>
    <p>His throw at the Home of Athletics at Kal­lang eclipsed Ng Bock Huat’s 32-year-old record of 59.22m.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old na­tional thrower said: “I didn’t ex­pect that throw to break the record, but it was a pleas­ant sur­prise.</p>
    <p>“It (break­ing the record) was def­i­nitely on my mind, but it’s al­ways very dif­fer­ent think­ing about it ver­sus achiev­ing it.”</p>
    <p>In the same meet, the na­tional Un­der-20 record was also rewrit­ten by Roy Ng, 17, with his throw of 57.19m eras­ing the pre­vi­ous mark of 56.44m set by Wang Tingjia in 2018.</p>
    <p>The SA Per­for­mance Trial 1, SA’s first meet since the cir­cuit breaker, is an in­vi­ta­tional event to pro­vide tiered and top-eight ranked ath­letes with com­pe­ti­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Phoa had aimed to break the na­tional record by the end of this year, but thought that it would take longer be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, which dis­rupted his train­ing pro­gramme for a few months. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and</p>
    <p>Phase 1 of the re­open­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, which lasted from April to mid-June, he was re­stricted to doing only body weight ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>The Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity stu­dent be­lieves that train­ing un­der na­tional throws coach Akid Chong since the start of the year is what made all the dif­fer­ence for him yes­ter­day. Un­der Chong, he has had a struc­tured train­ing pro­gramme to fol­low, un­like in 2018, when he was train­ing by him­self af­ter en­list­ing for na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“In 2018, I was just doing any ex­er­cises that I felt like doing on the day it­self,” said Phoa, who in 2017 broke a 47-year-old Schools A Divi­sion boys’ record with his 59.06m ef­fort.</p>
    <p>“But now, Akid splits the train­ing cy­cles into dif­fer­ent phases like strength and speed so as to prop­erly taper for the com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>While Phoa had been throw­ing dis­tances of about 54m to 56m in train­ing, he had been work­ing on his tech­nique, which Chong feels he fi­nally got right yes­ter­day. This time round, he man­aged to main­tain the up­right pos­ture in the power po­si­tion af­ter his penul­ti­mate step, re­sult­ing in his best throw yet.</p>
    <p>Chong, 30, be­lieves Phoa can even­tu­ally throw past 70m, a tar­get that they are try­ing to work to­wards by next year’s SEA Games in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The bronze-medal dis­tance at last year’s Games – which is the bench­mark for qual­i­fy­ing – was 70.88m, while gold medal­list Melvin Calano threw 72.86m.</p>
    <p>“We are plan­ning to take some time to train and are not rush­ing any­thing. We want to take it slow and cover our ground prop­erly,” said Chong. “If we are con­tin­u­ing to train as how it is from this pe­riod, I think there is a good chance that we can hit that (com­pet­ing at the 2021 SEA Games).”</p>
