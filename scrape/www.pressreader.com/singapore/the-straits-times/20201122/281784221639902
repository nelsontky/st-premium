    <p>The In­done­sian govern­ment has come down hard on those who have bro­ken health pro­to­cols, in the af­ter­math of massive crowds turn­ing up to cheer the re­turn of con­tro­ver­sial cleric Rizieq Shi­hab in two events ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Two provin­cial po­lice chiefs were re­moved from their posts for fail­ing to en­force safe dis­tanc­ing rules as thousands mobbed the coun­try’s main air­port on Nov 10 as well as turned up at a sep­a­rate event in cen­tral Jakarta on Nov 14.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have also sum­moned Jakarta Gover­nor Anies Baswedan for ques­tion­ing af­ter he breached quar­an­tine rules by vis­it­ing Mr Rizieq a few hours af­ter the fire­brand cleric re­turned home from self-ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>Mr Anies had also failed to stop the mass event in Jakarta’s Tanah Abang district, where thousands of mostly mask­less sup­port­ers of the Is­lamist cleric gath­ered – os­ten­si­bly to at­tend the wed­ding of Mr Rizieq’s daugh­ter and at the same time com­mem­o­rate the Prophet Muham­mad’s birthday.</p>
    <p>Jakarta – a coron­avirus red zone – cur­rently has in place strict so­cial re­stric­tions that are lo­cally called PSBB, which limit gath­er­ings to five peo­ple and re­quire a 14-day quar­an­tine for any­one en­ter­ing In­done­sia from overseas.</p>
    <p>The po­lice last week moved to ban a so-called “re­union rally” – planned for next month – of con­ser­va­tive Mus­lims, a base for Mr Rizieq and his hard­line group, Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front, or FPI.</p>
    <p>“We will not al­low (the rally). We will not is­sue the per­mit and we have been clear on the mat­ter,” na­tional po­lice spokesman Awi Seti</p>
    <p>yono told a news con­fer­ence last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Th­ese un­prece­dented mea­sures are be­ing taken by Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s ad­min­is­tra­tion as In­done­sia logged 493,308 cases of Covid-19 and 15,774 deaths as at Fri­day. Both fig­ures are the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter Tito Kar­na­vian is­sued an un­usual cir­cu­lar last Wed­nes­day to re­mind all di­rectly elected gov­er­nors and may­ors in In­done­sia that his of­fice, un­der the law, has the right to sack any of them if they fail to up­hold health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>The strong re­sponses showed the govern­ment’s se­ri­ous­ness in clamp­ing down on mass gath­er­ings amid the pan­demic. They also</p>
    <p>in­di­rectly pointed to Mr Rizieq’s abil­ity to bring crowds of con­ser­va­tive Mus­lims into the streets.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing be­tween Mr Anies and Mr Rizieq has led to whis­pers that the gover­nor is court­ing the preacher in prepa­ra­tion for a run in the 2024 presidenti­al elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, three years ago, in 2017, ow­ing to sup­port from Mr Rizieq, Mr Anies man­aged to oust then in­cum­bent Jakarta gover­nor Ba­suki “Ahok” Tja­haja Pur­nama.</p>
    <p>“Mr Anies ex­pects to get en­dorse­ment so he has le­git­i­macy, ac­knowl­edge­ment that he is a for­mi­da­ble politi­cian,” Pro­fes­sor Asep War­lan of Parahyan­gan Catholic Univer­sity told The Sun­day Times, when asked about Mr Anies go­ing as far as flout­ing health pro­to­cols to</p>
    <p>meet the cleric.</p>
    <p>Mr Anies, 51, is not the only politi­cian who has used Mr Rizieq’s crowd-woo­ing prow­ess to whip up mass sup­port in the streets.</p>
    <p>For­mer presidenti­al can­di­date Prabowo Su­bianto also used Mr Rizieq in his elec­toral fight against Mr Joko in the 2014 and 2019 presidenti­al elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Prabowo, 69, is now De­fence Min­is­ter in Mr Joko’s Cab­i­net and is thought to be keen to run again in the 2024 presidenti­al polls.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say In­done­sia can ex­pect more street rallies in the com­ing months – Covid-19 or not – with Mr Rizieq’s fiery speeches as the main draw.</p>
