    <p>Malaysia will ex­pand its con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO) be­gin­ning to­mor­row to nine of its 13 states after a record high 1,755 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions were logged last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Schools and en­ter­tain­ment out­lets will have to stay closed, while op­er­at­ing hours of eater­ies, sundry shops and con­ve­nience stores will be re­stricted to 6am to 10pm, among other re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said yes­ter­day that the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil agreed to im­pose the re­stric­tions up to Dec 6 as “the in­crease in new Covid-19 in­fec­tions has raised con­cern and anx­i­ety among the pub­lic and we can no longer re­main in the re­cov­ery move­ment con­trol or­der (RMCO)”.</p>
    <p>Malaysia had re­laxed curbs on eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties in June un­der the RMCO after three months of re­stric­tions had re­duced daily in­fec­tions to low dou­ble-dig­its.</p>
    <p>But after new clus­ters in Sabah were ex­ac­er­bated by the Sept 26 state polls, the coun­try has nearly quadru­pled its cu­mu­la­tive tally of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Sabah was then put un­der the CMCO on Oct 13, be­fore Se­lan­gor and fed­eral cap­i­tals Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya – col­lec­tively known as the Klang Val­ley – joined the east­ern­most state the day after. This bars in­ter-district travel ex­cept for work and emer­gency pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral dis­tricts in Negeri Sem­bi­lan, the state just south of Se­lan­gor, were also added at the end of last month.</p>
    <p>It was ex­pected that the CMCO would be ex­tended be­yond the pre­vi­ous Nov 9 ex­piry after the gov­ern­ment re­minded Malaysians last Thurs­day that those cel­e­brat­ing</p>
    <p>Deep­avali next week­end in the af­fected lo­ca­tions will not be able to travel out­side their dis­tricts to meet rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Those out­side will also not be able to visit loved ones in­side the re­stricted ar­eas.</p>
    <p>But the ex­pan­sion to all states save Sarawak on Bor­neo Is­land, Perlis and Ke­lan­tan in the north, and Pa­hang on the east coast of the penin­sula, puts nearly the en­tire coun­try back un­der re­stric­tions that have crip­pled brick-and-mor­tar re­tail and hospi­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>Al­though most eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity is al­lowed to con­tinue, those that ser­vice cus­tomers in per­son have been hit by re­quire­ments to limit the num­ber of pa­trons.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic tourism had also staged a mi­nor re­cov­ery dur­ing the RMCO, but the CMCO’s ban on in­ter-state travel has sent hote­liers reel­ing again.</p>
    <p>An­other 1,168 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions were re­ported yes­ter­day, bring­ing the tally to nearly 40,000. Three new deaths brought to­tal fa­tal­i­ties to 282, more than half of which were in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said yes­ter­day that the gov­ern­ment will de­cide to­mor­row whether an en­hanced move­ment con­trol or­der – ba­si­cally a to­tal lock­down – would be im­ple­mented for the en­tire state of Sabah, which has con­trib­uted the lion’s share of cases in the past two months.</p>
    <p>“We are very con­cerned... as you can see now, al­most all of Sabah are now red zones,” he said.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail also ex­plained that the nearly na­tion­wide CMCO will en­able the au­thor­i­ties to im­ple­ment tar­geted screen­ing while move­ment within the com­mu­nity is re­duced, thereby curb­ing the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral lo­ca­tions have been put un­der to­tal lock­down since the MCO be­gan on March 18, but this would be the first statewide one should the gov­ern­ment de­cide to do this to­mor­row.</p>
