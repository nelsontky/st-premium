    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON The United States Supreme Court on Fri­day re­jected a long-shot law­suit filed by Texas and backed by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump seek­ing to throw out vot­ing re­sults in four states, deal­ing him a likely fa­tal blow in his quest to undo his elec­tion loss to Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion al­lows the Elec­toral Col­lege to press ahead with a meet­ing to­mor­row, where it is ex­pected to for­mally cast its votes and make Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, a Demo­crat, has amassed 306 votes to Mr Trump’s 232 in the state-by-state Elec­toral Col­lege, which al­lots votes to all 50 states and the District of Columbia based on pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The four states in ques­tion – Ge­or­gia, Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin – con­trib­uted a com­bined 62 votes to Mr Bi­den’s to­tal. To win the White House, 270 votes are needed.</p>
    <p>In a brief or­der, the jus­tices said Texas did not have le­gal stand­ing to bring the case, abruptly end­ing what Mr Trump had touted last week as his best hope for over­turn­ing the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>While Mr Bi­den has moved for­ward with a wave of ap­point­ments for his in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion ahead of as­sum­ing of­fice on Jan 20, Mr Trump and his le­gal team have filed a flurry of un­suc­cess­ful law­suits in sev­eral states claim­ing voter fraud and chal­leng­ing the re­sults.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s goal had long been for a case to reach the Supreme Court, where he had placed three new jus­tices in his first term and where con­ser­va­tives hold a 6-3 ma­jor­ity. The l aw­suit brought by Texas and sup­ported by 17 other states and more than 100 Repub­li­can mem­bers of Congress gave him that op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>In the run-up to the Nov 3 elec­tion, Mr Trump had pushed for the swift con­fir­ma­tion of Jus­tice Amy Coney Bar­rett, with the pub­licly stated hope that she could be in a po­si­tion to help rule on an elec­tion chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>But Ms Bar­rett and the two other jus­tices ap­pointed by Mr Trump – Dr Neil Gor­such and Mr Brett Ka­vanaugh – signed on to the court’s or­der de­rail­ing the Texas suit with­out com­ment.</p>
    <p>“Texas has not demon­strated a ju­di­cially cog­nis­able in­ter­est in the man­ner in which an­other state con­ducts its elec­tions,” the court’s or­der said.</p>
    <p>Two of the court’s con­ser­va­tives, Jus­tice Sa­muel Al­ito and Jus­tice Clarence Thomas, said they would have al­lowed Texas to sue but would not have blocked the four states from fi­nal­is­ing their elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>To­gether with a case from Penn­syl­va­nia, it was the sec­ond time last week that the court spurned the at­tempt to over­turn the will of vot­ers.</p>
    <p>The Texas law­suit ar­gued that changes made by the four states to vot­ing pro­ce­dures amid the pan­demic to ex­pand mail-in vot­ing were un­law­ful.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken Pax­ton, the Repub­li­can At­tor­ney-Gen­eral of the state and a Trump ally who had filed the law­suit on Tues­day, said af­ter Fri­day’s rul­ing: “It is un­for­tu­nate that the Supreme Court de­cided not to take this case and de­ter­mine the con­sti­tu­tion­al­ity of these four states’ fail­ure to fol­low fed­eral and state elec­tion law.”</p>
    <p>UN­HAPPY OVER OUT­COME</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court re­ally let us down. No wis­dom, no courage!... Within a flash, it is thrown out and gone, with­out even look­ing at the many rea­sons it was brought. A rigged elec­tion, fight on!</p>
    <p>US PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP,</p>
    <p>To pro­mote his ef­fort to over­turn the elec­tion re­sults, Mr Trump’s cam­paign is buy­ing ads on un­spec­i­fied cable tele­vi­sion net­works that high­light claims of elec­toral fraud.</p>
    <p>One com­mer­cial claims that mail-in bal­lots were “a recipe for fraud” and urges view­ers to “con­tact your leg­is­la­tors to­day”. An­other shows footage of bal­lots be­ing pulled from un­der a ta­ble at</p>
    <p>State Farm Arena in At­lanta, where bal­lots were counted as a nar­ra­tor de­cries “suit­cases of bal­lots added in se­cret in Ge­or­gia”.</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial also high­lights “poll watch­ers de­nied ac­cess in</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia”, part of the Trump cam­paign’s com­plaint that Repub­li­can ob­servers were not al­lowed to mon­i­tor the count­ing of mail-in bal­lots in Philadel­phia and Pitts­burgh.</p>
