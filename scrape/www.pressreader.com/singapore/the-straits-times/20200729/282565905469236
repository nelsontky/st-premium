    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish nov­el­ist Hi­lary Mantel’s The Mir­ror And The Light – the con­clu­sion to her Thomas Cromwell tril­ogy – was an­nounced in Lon­don yes­ter­day as one of 13 nov­els com­pet­ing for this year’s Booker Prize, the Bri­tish lit­er­ary award.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can nov­el­ist Anne Tyler’s Red­head By The Side Of The Road is also on the list. But most of the other nom­i­nated books are less high-pro­file, with eight by de­but nov­el­ists, in­clud­ing Amer­i­can writer C Pam Zhang’s How Much Of Th­ese Hills Is Gold, about a Chi­nese Amer­i­can fam­ily dur­ing the Gold Rush.</p>
    <p>Nine of the longlisted au­thors are women.</p>
    <p>The Mir­ror And The Light is fo­cused on the fi­nal years of Thomas Cromwell’s life, as the chief ad­viser to King Henry VIII. The book was a sen­sa­tion in Bri­tain when it was pub­lished in March, de­spite it be­ing 875-page long.</p>
    <p>“Like Henry VIII, bloat has set in,” wrote Rob­bie Millen, in a review for the Times of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“It’s true that pas­sages of noun­bloat swell the vol­ume to gar­gan­tuan heft,” wrote Simon Schama in a review for The Fi­nan­cial Times, “but this reader wouldn’t want a word less”.</p>
    <p>Parul Se­h­gal, in a review for The</p>
    <p>New York Times, said the length was ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
    <p>“This is not a young man’s book, not a book of striv­ing,” she wrote. “It is a novel of late mid­dle age, a novel of pre­serv­ing what one has seized.”</p>
    <p>If The Mir­ror And The Light wins, Mantel would be­come the first author to take the prize three times. She won in 2009 for Wolf Hall and again in 2012 for Bring Up The Bod­ies, the two other Cromwell nov­els.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral nov­els in the run­ning fo­cus on race, in­clud­ing Ki­ley Reid’s Such A Fun Age, about two white peo­ple who com­pete for a black woman’s at­ten­tion to sig­nal their pro­gres­sive cre­den­tials.</p>
    <p>“There are voices from mi­nori­ties of­ten un­heard, sto­ries that are fresh, bold and ab­sorb­ing,” said Ms Mar­garet Busby, the chair­man of the judges, in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The other judges, who chose the 13 ti­tles from 162 sub­mit­ted books, in­clude thriller writer Lee Child and poet Lemn Sis­say.</p>
    <p>A short­list will be an­nounced in Septem­ber and the win­ning ti­tle will be un­veiled in Novem­ber. The author of that book will re­ceive £50,000 (S$88,700).</p>
    <p>Last year’s prize was shared by Cana­dian nov­el­ist Mar­garet At­wood for The Tes­ta­ments and Bri­tish author Bernar­dine Evaristo for Girl, Woman, Other, af­ter the judges de­cided to rebel against their own rules and split the prize, a de­ci­sion that was met with wide­spread de­ri­sion.</p>
    <p>This year’s longlist seems un­likely to cause sim­i­lar con­tro­versy, al­though it does in­clude six au­thors born in the United States, as well as three oth­ers who claim US cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>There have been reg­u­lar com­plaints about Amer­i­cans’ el­i­gi­bil­ity for the prize, some­thing al­lowed only in 2014.</p>
    <p>Be­fore then, it was lim­ited to books by writ­ers from Bri­tain, Ire­land and Com­mon­wealth coun­tries plus South Africa and, later, Zim­babwe.</p>
