    <p>PARIS • French lux­ury gi­ant LVMH ac­cused US jew­eller Tif­fany of “dis­hon­esty” on Thurs­day, say­ing it would do bat­tle in court as plans for a sparkling tie-up de­scended into bit­ter re­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“LVMH was sur­prised by the law­suit filed by Tif­fany,” the French owner of brands such as Louis Vuit­ton, Dior and Moet & Chan­don said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“LVMH con­sid­ers that this ac­tion is to­tally un­founded. It has clearly been pre­pared by Tif­fany a long time ago and (was) com­mu­ni­cated in a mis­lead­ing way to share­hold­ers and is defam­a­tory.</p>
    <p>“The long prepa­ra­tion of this as­sign­ment demon­strates the dis­hon­esty of Tif­fany in its re­la­tions with LVMH,” it added.</p>
    <p>The French firm vowed to “de­fend it­self vig­or­ously” against Tif­fany’s ac­cu­sa­tion that it had failed to seek reg­u­la­tory ap­provals for the planned US$16.2 bil­lion (S$22 bil­lion) ac­qui­si­tion in a timely man­ner.</p>
    <p>LVMH also said it had been able to ex­am­ine Tif­fany’s cur­rent eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion – the coronaviru­s pandemic has weighed heav­ily on the lux­ury sec­tor – and its man­age­ment of a cri­sis that has ham­mered its mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>The French group “noted that the first-half re­sults and its per­spec­tives for 2020 are very dis­ap­point­ing, and sig­nif­i­cantly in­fe­rior to those of com­pa­ra­ble brands of the LVMH group dur­ing this pe­riod”.</p>
    <p>It thus “con­firms that the nec­es­sary con­di­tions for the con­clu­sion of the ac­qui­si­tion of Tif­fany are not ful­filled”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter LVMH called off the ac­qui­si­tion, Tif­fany vowed to take le­gal ac­tion to push the deal through.</p>
    <p>The French group said on Wed­nes­day that its board had de­cided not to pro­ceed with the deal fol­low­ing “a suc­ces­sion of events which un­der­mine the ac­qui­si­tion of Tif­fany & Co”, no­tably US threats to slap tar­iffs on French prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>It said that a let­ter from French For­eign Min­is­ter Jean-Yves Le Drian di­rected it to de­fer the deal in re­ac­tion to Wash­ing­ton’s tax threat and also noted that Tif­fany had re­quested an ex­ten­sion to the clos­ing date of the merger.</p>
    <p>LVMH also says that Tif­fany paid out large div­i­dends while mak­ing losses, which has af­fected its op­er­a­tions and or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Tif­fany’s mar­ket value is now much less than when the deal was signed. The jew­eller’s ri­poste was to ac­cuse LVMH of breach­ing “obli­ga­tions re­lat­ing to ob­tain­ing an­titrust clear­ance” for the deal.</p>
    <p>Board chair­man Roger Farah charged that LVMH was us­ing “any avail­able means” to avoid clos­ing the trans­ac­tion on the agreed terms.</p>
    <p>But for LVMH, es­sen­tial reg­u­la­tory fil­ings with the Euro­pean Union au­thor­i­ties would take place “as ex­pected, in the fol­low­ing days, and this is sim­ply the re­sult of the plan­ning fixed by the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, about which Tif­fany is com­pletely aware”.</p>
    <p>A source close to the mat­ter told Agence France-Presse: “All this shows that re­la­tions with Tif­fany are af­fected (for the) long term, if not bro­ken al­to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Share prices of the two com­pa­nies were sta­ble on Thurs­day as Tif­fany gave up just 0.1 per cent to US$113.91 in late New York trad­ing, while LVMH was es­sen­tially un­changed at €404.35.</p>
    <p>LVMH had agreed to pay around US$135 a share for Tif­fany, but they traded for around US$122 ahead of the LVMH an­nounce­ment on Wed­nes­day.</p>
