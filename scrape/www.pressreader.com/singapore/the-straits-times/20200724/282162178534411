    <p>HONG KONG • In­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies are in­creas­ingly avoid­ing Hong Kong as a ju­ris­dic­tion for set­tling dis­putes through ar­bi­tra­tion, one of the clear­est signs yet that China’s tight­en­ing grip on the fi­nan­cial hub has eroded trust in its le­gal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses are in­stead choos­ing ri­val hubs like Sin­ga­pore, Paris and London, ac­cord­ing to in­ter­views with ar­bi­tra­tion lawyers, a shift that has ac­cel­er­ated since the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment by­passed Hong Kong’s leg­is­la­ture to im­pose a sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Lawyers say the new leg­is­la­tion has raised doubts about the in­de­pen­dence of Hong Kong ar­bi­tra­tors, who are now sub­ject to a vaguely worded statute car­ry­ing po­ten­tial life sen­tences for crimes in­clud­ing sub­ver­sion of state power and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces.</p>
    <p>Of par­tic­u­lar con­cern is the po­ten­tial im­pact on con­tract dis­putes with Chi­nese com­pa­nies, ac­cord­ing to Mr Khelvin Xu, a part­ner at Ra­jah & Tann Sin­ga­pore who spe­cialises in in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion and trib­utable in­come fell 21.7 per cent to $129.3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Gross rev­enue was 2.2 per cent lower at $196.4 mil­lion, while NPI eased 4.5 per cent to $151.1 mil­lion for the half year. com­mer­cial lit­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Robert Rdoda, part­ner at Den­tons Hong Kong, said: “Par­ties to con­tracts are ques­tion­ing whether Hong Kong re­mains a neu­tral and ef­fec­tive seat of ar­bi­tra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Com­mon Law sys­tem and highly re­garded sta­ble of le­gal pro­fes­sion­als have long un­der­pinned its ap­peal as a fi­nan­cial hub.</p>
    <p>But some fear the city is be­com­ing a less safe place to do busi­ness as China plays a more as­sertive role</p>
    <p>Mr Kevin Chee, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the man­ager, said: “CCT’s Q2 2020 re­sults re­flected the im­pact of our port­fo­lio repo­si­tion­ing and rental sup­port for ten­ants amid Covid-19. Re­tain­ing and sup­port­ing in Hong Kong af­fairs.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity law is one rea­son why Mr Wu Gang, who runs a Canada-based fin­tech com­pany, has been opt­ing for al­ter­na­tive ju­ris­dic­tions, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, when draft­ing ar­bi­tra­tion clauses in con­tracts with coun­ter­par­ties in Asia. He also cited Hong Kong’s near shut­down at times last year be­cause of anti-gov­ern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>“The so­cial un­rest and changes in law have prompted us to think twice,” Mr Wu said.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this year, Hong Kong was one of the world’s top ar­bi­tra­tion cen­tres. It han­dled at least 308 dis­putes in­volv­ing US$4.7 bil­lion (S$6.5 bil­lion) last year, fig­ures from the Hong Kong In­ter­na­tional Ar­bi­tra­tion Cen­tre show.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies use ar­bi­tra­tion as an al­ter­na­tive to lit­i­ga­tion in courts, agree­ing to des­ig­nate an in­de­pen­dent third party to re­solve their dis­agree­ments in pri­vate. our ten­ants through the Covid-19 chal­lenges re­main a pri­or­ity for CCT. To en­sure that our port­fo­lio main­tains a sus­tain­able path to fu­ture growth, we are fo­cused on com­plet­ing the as­set en­hance­ments of</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s ap­peal as an ar­bi­tra­tion hub may have di­min­ished this year, but it still of­fers ad­van­tages over ri­vals, said Mr Rhoda.</p>
    <p>For one, it is the only place out­side main­land China where par­ties to ar­bi­tra­tion can ob­tain in­terim re­lief from Chi­nese courts, pre­vent­ing com­pa­nies from liq­ui­dat­ing as­sets. That has not stopped some firms from seek­ing al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, which has been mov­ing ahead of Hong Kong as an ar­bi­tra­tion hub in re­cent years, is well po­si­tioned to win busi­ness from those who view Hong Kong as in­creas­ingly part of main­land China, said Ra­jah & Tann’s Mr Xu.</p>
    <p>Mr Thomas Ken­dra, a Paris­based part­ner at Ho­gan Lovells, said: “Will com­pa­nies re­con­sider choos­ing Hong Kong as their place of ar­bi­tra­tion? Def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>“I would say that the first place that could ben­e­fit would be Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Six Bat­tery Road and 21 Col­lyer Quay, as well as the de­vel­op­ment of Cap­i­taSpring in 2021.”</p>
