    <p>Mr Zhuo Yuan Long’s love for singing started when he was a child and he would sing any­thing from Hokkien to Malay num­bers.</p>
    <p>When he was work­ing as a crane driver in the early 1960s, he of­ten sang as he worked, earn­ing him the nick­name “Do Re Mi”.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhuo turned 85 re­cently, but his love af­fair with singing has con­tin­ued un­abated.</p>
    <p>He had planned to hold a con­cert on his birth­day last Satur­day at the Sin­ga­pore Con­fer­ence Hall and even in­vited guest singers, but the pan­demic put a stop to that.</p>
    <p>“As a singer, I love to per­form. But I haven’t been able to put up any recitals this year be­cause of Covid-19,” said Mr Zhuo, who used to run his own crane busi­ness but re­tired in 2000.</p>
    <p>The singing en­thu­si­ast has taken part in nu­mer­ous con­certs, in­clud­ing events in Tian­jin, China.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Mr Zhuo laughed as he re­counted his singing skills as a young am­a­teur.</p>
    <p>“Back then, I couldn’t sing well, but I would still sing,” he quipped.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up dur­ing the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion was dif­fi­cult for Mr Zhuo.</p>
    <p>He dropped out of pri­mary school af­ter about a year to be­come a hawker and later turned to odd jobs, earn­ing just $1.90 a day. Yet, singing was al­ways on his mind.</p>
    <p>He joined choir groups such as the Hokkien Huay Kuan Choir and the now de­funct Tong Luo Cho­ral Group.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhuo cred­ited his im­prove­ment in singing to teach­ers – some of whom hailed from coun­tries such as Aus­tralia and Eng­land – who coached him over the past six decades.</p>
    <p>“I only be­came bet­ter and learnt the cor­rect singing skills when I started learn­ing from these teach­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>He ini­tially strug­gled with singing opera songs, many of which had Italian lyrics that he found dif­fi­cult to pro­nounce.</p>
    <p>But his Italian im­proved tremen­dously af­ter he en­rolled in a pri­vate school to learn the In­ter­na­tional Pho­netic Al­pha­bet.</p>
    <p>“My singing teacher at that time even said my Italian pro­nun­ci­a­tion was bet­ter than some Western­ers’,” he said.</p>
    <p>While con­certs may not be pos­si­ble for now, Mr Zhuo still prac­tises singing almost ev­ery day for two to three hours in the flat he shares with his wife, 68.</p>
    <p>They have five daugh­ter sin their 40s and seven grand­chil­dren aged from four to seven.</p>
    <p>Some­times, he said, he re­hearses more than 20 songs in a day.</p>
    <p>He finds it hard to ex­plain his love for singing.</p>
    <p>“I just know that when I sing, I feel very sat­is­fied,” he said.</p>
    <p>When asked what ad­vice he would give to other el­derly peo­ple look­ing to pur­sue in­ter­ests in the arts, Mr Zhuo had only one thing to say: “Do what makes you happy.”</p>
