    <p>Where: 70 Seran­goon Gar­den Way Open: 9am to 4am</p>
    <p>One of 59 out­lets, this branch in Seran­goon may change the per­cep­tion of those who think chain out­lets can­not churn out good-qual­ity food.</p>
    <p>You will be spoilt for choice with the num­ber of dishes – be­tween 40 and 45 dishes daily.</p>
    <p>Kimly sur­passes other econ­omy rice stalls when it comes to deep-fried items.</p>
    <p>Be it pork, chicken or fish, the bat­ter is crispy, even when cov­ered in sauce. It is best to go at 11am and</p>
    <p>5pm, when the food is freshly cooked for the lunch and din­ner crowd.</p>
    <p>Go for lemon fish ($1.50 a serv­ing), which is tan­ta­lis­ingly tangy with ac­tual slices of lemon.</p>
    <p>An­other win­ning dish is plum sauce fried chicken ($1.50 a serv­ing), com­pris­ing crispy pieces of bone­less chicken thigh lightly coated in a sweet tangy sauce.</p>
    <p>The clams in chilli ($2 a serv­ing) are rea­son­ably fresh, with most still in­tact in their shells. They are fresher than some of the lala dishes at zi char stalls.</p>
    <p>Stir-fried French beans with minced pork are per­fectly cooked, with crunch and no over­whelm­ing oili­ness.</p>
    <p>The stall’s sig­na­ture mei cai kou rou (braised pork belly with pre­served mus­tard greens, $5 a plate) has de­cent flavour, but the pork belly meat is tough and chewy.</p>
    <p>The stall gets brownie points for ser­vice. Curry gravy is com­pli­men­tary, even if you ask for it to be served sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>Also, un­like many other econ­omy rice stalls, the prices of the dishes are the same whether you ask for the dish to be served on the rice or sep­a­rately.</p>
