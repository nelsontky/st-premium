    <p>A study of health­care work­ers in Sin­ga­pore and In­dia has found that a ma­jor­ity of those who have to wear per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) ex­pe­ri­ence symp­toms of ther­mal strain, in­clud­ing ex­ces­sive sweat­ing, ex­haus­tion and dizzi­ness.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has re­sulted in more front-line work­ers hav­ing to wear PPE for a pro­longed pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>In a pa­per pub­lished in the peer­re­viewed In­ter­na­tional Journal of En­vi­ron­men­tal Re­search and Pub­lic Health on Tues­day, the re­searchers said that this ex­ac­er­bates these work­ers’ risk of ther­mal strain.</p>
    <p>The study’s se­nior and cor­re­spond­ing au­thor, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Jason Lee of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, ex­plained yes­ter­day that ther­mal strain refers to the amount of heat a per­son ex­pe­ri­ences in­ter­nally.</p>
    <p>This is in­flu­enced not just by cli­matic con­di­tions, but also other fac­tors such as a per­son’s fit­ness and what one is wear­ing or do­ing.</p>
    <p>Prof Lee, who is from t he school’s Hu­man Po­ten­tial Trans­la­tional Re­search Pro­gramme, told The Straits Times that in a worstcase sce­nario, ther­mal strain can re­sult in heat stroke and death.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore that, your per­for­mance will be com­pro­mised... it is not just you (who will be af­fected), but those whom you care for,” he said, not­ing that if a health­care worker is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing ther­mal strain, pa­tient care could also be af­fected.</p>
    <p>One of the study’s other au­thors, Dr Jimmy Lee, a con­sul­tant at Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal’s (NTFGH) Emer­gency Medicine depart­ment, said front-line health­care work­ers at NTFGH keep their PPE on for seven to eight hours at a time.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard PPE in­cludes gog­gles, a sur­gi­cal cap, an N95 mask, sur­gi­cal gloves and a gown. But most of these com­po­nents are mois­ture im­per­me­able, which means they also trap sweat.</p>
    <p>Prof Lee said: “If sweat doesn’t evap­o­rate, it does noth­ing – you are not los­ing heat... In PPE, sweat can­not evap­o­rate.”</p>
    <p>Dr Lee, who wears PPE in the course of his work, said he has seen some med­i­cal of­fi­cers get “soaked” in sweat af­ter just two hours.</p>
    <p>To­gether with a team of other re­searchers, he and Prof Lee con­ducted a study of 55 health­care work­ers at NTFGH and an­other 110 from In­dia, who were asked to an­swer a ques­tion­naire on their knowl­edge about ther­mal strain, at­ti­tudes to­wards PPE use and be­havioural changes while wear­ing PPE.</p>
    <p>Some 90 per cent of health­care work­ers in Sin­ga­pore re­ported sweat­ing ex­ces­sively in their PPE, while 76 per cent said they felt ex­hausted.</p>
    <p>Also, 29 per cent ex­pe­ri­enced dizzi­ness as a re­sult of their PPE, 22 per cent got headaches and 13 per cent had dif­fi­culty breath­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents were also given ice slurry – a bev­er­age made by mix­ing ice with a sports drink – and asked to rate their ther­mal com­fort be­fore and af­ter drink­ing it. Those who drank it re­ported that they felt more com­fort­able af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers made three rec­om­men­da­tions in the light of their find­ings. First, that ice slurry ma­chines should be pro­vided to health­care work­ers to help them lower their body tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, there is a need to op­ti­mise the work-rest cy­cle of health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers said that although more re­search would be needed to pre­scribe a spe­cific bal­ance, it would be an area worth look­ing into as this, too, would help man­age the ef­fects of ther­mal strain.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, Prof Lee said aer­o­bic fit­ness is the most ef­fec­tive way to mit­i­gate the ef­fects of ther­mal strain, so more em­pha­sis needs to be placed on rais­ing it among health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “We want to make life bet­ter for health­care work­ers... it shouldn’t be (that) dur­ing the next pan­demic or re­lated event, we go about quan­ti­fy­ing an­other round of health­care worker ther­mal stress. That should be part of the prepa­ra­tion pack­age. If we know some­thing is com­ing and PPE will have to be (put) on, then ice slur­ries and cool­ing fa­cil­i­ties should be part of the lo­gis­tics.”</p>
    <p>Dr Lee added: “In this pe­riod, oc­cu­pa­tional health is very im­por­tant. We wanted to raise aware­ness about the im­por­tance of (ther­mal strain). Be­cause we have lim­ited re­sources and man­power... pre­serv­ing this re­source is im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>AF­FECTS PA­TIENTS TOO</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, your per­for­mance will be com­pro­mised... it is not just you (who will be af­fected), but those whom you care for.</p>
    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR JASON LEE, of the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, on how ther­mal strain can im­pact pa­tient care be­fore badly af­fect­ing the wearer.</p>
    <p>Top: Front-line health­care work­ers at Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal keep their per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) on for seven to eight hours at a time. Most of the com­po­nents of the PPE are mois­ture im­per­me­able, which means they also trap sweat, and this re­sults in some work­ers sweat­ing ex­ces­sively (above).</p>
