    <p>Some leas­ing firms are sidestep­ping a com­pre­hen­sive set of mea­sures put in place to de­ter money­len­ders from tar­get­ing for­eign­ers. The Straits Times un­der­stands that two leas­ing firms – Xpress Leas­ing and Mi­cro Leas­ing – are cur­rently be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for their busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Filipino maid Fe­lyn was barred from tak­ing out loans from li­censed money­len­ders un­der a self-ex­clu­sion frame­work, so she tried to bor­row from a friend.</p>
    <p>The friend in­stead told Fe­lyn that she could get quick cash from a leas­ing firm by sell­ing her mobile phone and then leas­ing it back.</p>
    <p>Last month, Fe­lyn went to Xpress Leas­ing at Tex­tile Cen­tre in Jalan Sul­tan and ob­tained $760 af­ter sign­ing a lease agree­ment for her own mobile phone. “A staff told me the com­pany is not a money­len­der, but a leas­ing firm. He said the price for my hand­phone was $1,000, but he would pay me $760. I would then have to rent my hand­phone at $300 a month for four months,” said the 52-year-old maid, who wanted to be known only by her nick­name.</p>
    <p>She said she ac­cepted the of­fer as she needed to pay for her daugh­ter’s uni­ver­sity fees and liv­ing ex­penses.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ob­servers say this may mean that some leas­ing firms are sidestep­ping the com­pre­hen­sive set of mea­sures to de­ter money­len­ders from tar­get­ing for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that two leas­ing firms – Xpress Leas­ing and Mi­cro Leas­ing – are cur­rently be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for their busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries re­gard­ing the two firms, the po­lice would only “con­firm that reports were lodged and in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing”. At least two maids are be­lieved to be as­sist­ing of­fi­cers from the un­li­censed­moneylend­ing unit in in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, a Xpress Leas­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tive con­firmed the “buy and lease-back scheme”, but said the firm “has de­cided to stop of­fer­ing it to for­eign­ers since the be­gin­ning of this month as many of them do not un­der­stand how it works”.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing how the scheme worked, he said that if the firm bought a cell­phone from a maid for $1,000, only $760 would be paid be­cause $240 would be treated as rental fee for the device for the first month. The rental fee sub­se­quently would be $50 a month.</p>
    <p>The maid also has the op­tion of getting her phone back by buy­ing it for $1,000 which can be paid in in­stal­ments over four months.</p>
    <p>“So she will pay $300 a month for four months and keep the hand­phone. If not, it would just be $50 a month for the rental of the hand­phone,” the rep­re­sen­ta­tive said.</p>
    <p>Mi­cro Leas­ing’s owner Nel­son</p>
    <p>Kok de­nied any wrong­do­ing and said his lawyer was as­sist­ing in po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions. “We are not a money­len­der and we don’t is­sue cash to maids. We have put up no­tices on the com­pany’s Face­book page and also in the of­fice that we are not a money­len­der,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We also do not buy hand­phones from maids and lease back to them.</p>
    <p>We have our own sup­ply of hand­phones to lease to them. Once they com­plete pay­ing for a min­i­mum pe­riod of rental, they get to keep the hand­phones.” Mr Kok said about half of his cus­tomers are maids, but they are not specif­i­cally tar­geted.</p>
    <p>ST spoke to five maids who took al­leged loans from ei­ther of the leas­ing firms. One of them, who wanted to be known only as Gen, 42, said: “I bor­rowed $1,500 and I was given $1,200. One man came to my em­ployer’s house to hand me the cash. I was given a bank ac­count num­ber and told to pay $390 a month for six months.”</p>
    <p>In July last year, the Min­istry of Law said stricter mea­sures were nec­es­sary to curb the sharp rise in the num­ber of for­eign­ers bor­row­ing from li­censed money­len­ders, which had risen to 53,000 in the first half of last year, as com­pared with 55,000 for 2018 and 19,000 in 2017.</p>
    <p>The stricter rules, which saw the num­ber of loans to for­eign­ers capped at 50 a year and the loan cap low­ered to $500 for low-in­come for­eign­ers, have made for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers (FDWs) less ap­peal­ing to li­censed money­len­ders, said Credit As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Peter Tan. “Li­censed money­len­ders would pre­fer to lend to pro­fes­sion­als, and FDWs would thus be driven to un­li­censed money­len­ders and loan sharks.”</p>
    <p>Pas­tor Billy Lee, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of Blessed Grace So­cial Ser­vices, claimed that the firms have taken ad­van­tage of the sit­u­a­tion “by giv­ing out loans in the guise of leas­ing hand­phones”. “There were no trans­ac­tions in­volv­ing hand­phones. The FDWs were given con­tracts to sign and money dis­bursed. They were not given a copy of the con­tracts,” said Pas­tor Lee, who has been help­ing dis­tressed maids with mul­ti­ple debts and hopes the au­thor­i­ties will re­view the frame­work to give FDWs more ac­cess to le­git­i­mate loans.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Chia Boon Teck of Chia Wong Cham­bers said: “If it tran­spires that the maid is aware that she is en­ter­ing into a fic­ti­tious phone-leas­ing trans­ac­tion as a dis­guise for il­le­gal mon­eylend­ing, she may be ac­cused of abet­ting the il­le­gal money­len­der in the com­mis­sion of the of­fence, in which case her pun­ish­ment would be the same as the il­le­gal money­len­der if con­victed.”</p>
