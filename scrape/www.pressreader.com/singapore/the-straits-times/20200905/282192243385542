    <p>All in­te­grated shield plan (IP) in­sur­ers will pro­vide cov­er­age for di­ag­nos­tic en­doscopy – a com­mon pro­ce­dure that al­lows doc­tors to look in­side a pa­tient’s body and de­tect diseases – when it is med­i­cally nec­es­sary, the Life In­sur­ance As­so­ci­a­tion, Sin­ga­pore (LIA) clar­i­fied in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This means that one in­surer, which dis­al­lowed such claims re­cently, will no longer be do­ing so.</p>
    <p>The state­ment comes af­ter the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion (SMA) said in an Aug 29 let­ter in The Straits Times Fo­rum sec­tion that some in­sur­ers – with­out nam­ing any – are no longer al­low­ing claims for di­ag­nos­tic en­do­scopies, even when they are med­i­cally re­quired.</p>
    <p>It prompted an out­cry among spe­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>LIA said that “among the seven IP in­sur­ers, only one in­surer pre­vi­ously had stricter claim rules in re­la­tion to gas­troin­testi­nal en­doscopy, con­sis­tent with their pol­icy terms and con­di­tions”.</p>
    <p>The in­surer has “since aligned its prac­tices with pre­vail­ing in­dus­try norms and pol­i­cy­hold­ers can be as­sured that their med­i­cally nec­es­sary di­ag­nos­tic en­do­scopies will be cov­ered by all IP in­sur­ers”, it added.</p>
    <p>This in­surer is Aviva.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, its spokesman said that since March this year, the firm had started to take “a stricter stance in claims as­sess­ment to­wards a small num­ber of claims for stand­alone en­do­scopies that were not as­so­ci­ated with in-pa­tient treat­ment or hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>He said this is in line with its pol­icy terms.</p>
    <p>“We re­viewed this prac­tice in Au­gust and sub­se­quently de­cided to ap­prove claims for en­do­scopies be­cause they are day surg­eries, even if they do not lead to in-pa­tient treat­ment or hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We had al­ready started ap­prov­ing new claims for stand­alone en­do­scopies in Au­gust, and will be ini­ti­at­ing re­vised claim set­tle­ments for such en­doscopy claims that were pre­vi­ously re­jected.”</p>
    <p>Doc­tors ST spoke to said some af­fected pa­tients have had to pay out of their own pocket and some had said no to the pro­ce­dure, though this may cause a de­lay in di­ag­no­sis and worsen the pa­tients’ con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng Chee Kwan, the SMA’s first vice-pres­i­dent, said that un­til early this year, all in­sur­ers would cover the costs of di­ag­nos­tic en­do­scopies for their clients with IPs, as part of their cov­er­age for all day surgery and hos­pi­tal ad­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>He said the pro­ce­dure is the only re­li­able way of de­tect­ing some of the more com­mon can­cers here, such as col­orec­tal cancer, gas­tric cancer and na­sopha­ryn­geal cancer.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­dent of the So­ci­ety of Col­orec­tal Sur­geons (Sin­ga­pore), Dr Ng Chee Yung, said he no­ticed from the start of the year that “some in­sur­ers started to either cat­e­gor­i­cally stop cov­er­age or started a process of their own vet­ting – through pre-au­tho­ri­sa­tion – that would ques­tion the spe­cial­ist’s in­di­ca­tion for the pro­ce­dure and ul­ti­mately deny the cov­er­age in many in­stances”.</p>
    <p>The cost of di­ag­nos­tic en­doscopy varies – there are dif­fer­ent types, and it may range from be­low $500 to $3,000 and above.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Wu Meng, chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Committee for Health, high­lighted SMA’s ST Fo­rum let­ter in Par­lia­ment ear­lier this week, say­ing that when an in­sur­ance firm moves the goal­posts for an IP plan, it is not so easy for a pa­tient to switch providers as his ex­ist­ing health con­di­tions be­come pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions un­der the new pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Gas­troin­testi­nal en­do­scopies are among the most com­mon pro­ce­dures seen in IP claims.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to me­dia queries yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health said that in re­cent years, “in­sur­ers have in­tro­duced claim man­age­ment poli­cies to pro­mote ap­pro­pri­ate util­i­sa­tion of med­i­cal care as part of their ef­forts to keep health­care costs af­ford­able and sus­tain­able”.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age in­sur­ers and clin­i­cians to work to­gether closely to de­velop and re­view these poli­cies, to en­sure that these en­cour­age ap­pro­pri­ate med­i­cal di­ag­no­sis and care, and are ben­e­fi­cial for pol­i­cy­hold­ers.”</p>
