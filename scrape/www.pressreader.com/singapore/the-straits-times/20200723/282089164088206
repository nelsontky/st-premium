    <p>Look­ing back on his 14 years as an MP, Mr Lee Yi Shyan mar­vels at how he survived the most hec­tic days.</p>
    <p>Cof­fee, Red Bull and chicken essence played a role, he re­calls. Even then, there were days when he felt like nod­ding off at the wheel.</p>
    <p>Din­ner was of­ten two red bean buns and a packet of milk, pur­chased at a petrol kiosk and eaten on the go. “It was quite de­mand­ing in terms of men­tal en­ergy and phys­i­cal fit­ness,” said the 58-year-old.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee en­tered pol­i­tics in 2006, after step­ping down as chief ex­ec­u­tive of In­ter­na­tional En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, which was later merged with an­other statu­tory board to form En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Fielded in East Coast GRC, he was ap­pointed Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try after the gen­eral elec­tion and later pro­moted to Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>But fol­low­ing a mi­nor stroke in May 2015, he de­cided to “change gear” and re­turn to the back­bench.</p>
    <p>To round off his three terms in East Coast, his ac­tivists ini­ti­ated a com­mem­o­ra­tive book called Heart­beat of Be­dok.</p>
    <p>Its ti­tle echoes the name of the seven-storey in­te­grated build­ing in his Kam­pong Chai Chee ward which took nearly 10 years to build.</p>
    <p>The process, in Mr Lee’s own words, “felt al­most like try­ing to get a panda to con­ceive”.</p>
    <p>He is proud of how the Heart­beat@Be­dok com­plex – which boasts a li­brary, poly­clinic and com­mu­nity club, among oth­ers – has helped bring the com­mu­nity to­gether.</p>
    <p>“There is a sim­ple joy in ev­ery­day in­ter­ac­tions that gives me a lot of sat­is­fac­tion,” he said. “I think th­ese were the high points.”</p>
    <p>Asked about the low points of his ca­reer, Mr Lee im­me­di­ately brings up GE2011, when the na­tion­wide mood swung against the PAP.</p>
    <p>In East Coast, Mr Lee’s team won against the Work­ers’ Party with 54.8 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>“I felt a bit help­less,” he said, adding that na­tional sen­ti­ment and the qual­ity of their op­po­nents played a big­ger role that year.</p>
    <p>“You could have done a great amount of good work on the ground, but it would all be very heav­ily dis­counted.”</p>
    <p>Now that he has re­tired, Mr Lee plans to fo­cus on his day job at OUE, and give his suc­ces­sor – Mr Tan Kiat How – the space to op­er­ate in the man­ner he sees fit.</p>
    <p>“For us who have re­tired, we have to be mind­ful that our pres­ence in the con­stituency should only add value to the new leader, and not make them feel awk­ward,” he said. “The new per­son should have to­tal free­dom to de­cide how things should be run.”</p>
