    <p>StarHub an­nounced yes­ter­day that its chief ex­ec­u­tive Peter Kaliaropou­los will re­tire and step down from his po­si­tion with ef­fect from Oct 31.</p>
    <p>Mr Kaliaropou­los, an Aus­tralian, said he re­turned to Syd­ney ur­gently to be closer to his fam­ily due to the un­fore­seen and se­ri­ous health is­sues of a close fam­ily mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Fol­low­ing al­most 40 years in the in­dus­try across mul­ti­ple coun­tries, it is also the right moment in my ca­reer to step down from full-time ex­ec­u­tive roles,” he added.</p>
    <p>StarHub said it will im­me­di­ately com­mence a global search for a new CEO.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany said its board will es­tab­lish an in­terim board ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee to pro­vide sup­port to the com­pany’s lead­er­ship team dur­ing the search for a new CEO, and to over­see the smooth tran­si­tion once that per­son is se­lected.</p>
    <p>It added that Mr Kaliaropou­los will serve as a co-opted mem­ber on the in­terim board ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee un­til the new CEO is hired.</p>
    <p>When asked if StarHub would con­sider se­lect­ing a Sin­ga­porean as its next CEO, Mr Kaliaropou­los said yes­ter­day that he could not speak for the in­terim com­mit­tee, but added that the best per­son avail­able would be se­lected and that StarHub was likely to look within the com­pany, lo­cally and glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Kaliaropou­los’ time as CEO is his sec­ond stint with the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The 61-year-old first joined StarHub in Jan­uary 1999 as se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of com­mer­cial op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>He left in June 2000 to take on sev­eral C-suite roles in New Zealand, Aus­tralia and the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>In July 2018, Mr Kaliaropou­los re­joined StarHub as its CEO.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber of the same year, he over­saw a $25 mil­lion re­trench­ment ex­er­cise, dur­ing which 300 of the com­pany’s 2,500 em­ploy­ees were laid off, as part of the com­pany’s strate­gic trans­for­ma­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>StarHub said then that the pro­gramme aimed to im­prove op­er­a­tional ef­fi­cien­cies and pro­duc­tiv­ity, and was ex­pected to re­alise $210 mil­lion in sav­ings over a three-year pe­riod from last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Kaliaropou­los said he was ex­tremely for­tu­nate to have been a mem­ber of the StarHub team twice, adding that he felt he was leav­ing the com­pany in good hands.</p>
    <p>“We have put a team to­gether of very ex­pe­ri­enced pro­fes­sion­als, and even if one mem­ber of the board steps down, the team is cer­tainly good enough and strong enough to keep driv­ing the busi­ness for­ward,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the com­pany’s strate­gic trans­for­ma­tion is “well un­der way but not com­plete”.</p>
    <p>StarHub said its board will es­tab­lish an in­terim board ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee to pro­vide sup­port to the com­pany’s lead­er­ship team dur­ing the search for a new chief ex­ec­u­tive, and to over­see the smooth tran­si­tion once that per­son is se­lected. It added that Mr Kaliaropou­los will serve as a co-opted mem­ber on the in­terim board ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee un­til the new CEO is hired.</p>
