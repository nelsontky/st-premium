    <p>LON­DON Pep Guardi­ola faces a stern test of his man­age­rial phi­los­o­phy as the Manch­ester City boss aims to over­haul Premier League cham­pi­ons Liver­pool this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an ex­tra week of rest due to be­ing in the lat­ter stages of last sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League, City start their Premier League cam­paign with a tricky trip to Wolves today.</p>
    <p>It is ex­actly the kind of fix­ture that proved fa­tal to City’s hopes of re­tain­ing the ti­tle last sea­son.</p>
    <p>They were beaten twice by Wolves, even­tu­ally los­ing nine league games and fin­ish­ing a mas­sive 18 points be­hind Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola knows City can­not af­ford so many un­ex­pected stum­bles this sea­son. But he might need to look in the mir­ror as he analy­ses their steep de­cline.</p>
    <p>His in­abil­ity to fix City’s de­fen­sive prob­lems and con­stant tin­ker­ing with his mid­field and at­tack seemed to spread con­fu­sion and frus­tra­tion among his squad.</p>
    <p>Only Kevin de Bruyne en­joyed a tran­scen­dent sea­son for City but the Bel­gian mid­field mae­stro could not carry his team all alone.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s po­si­tional switches desta­bilised them again in their shock Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter­fi­nal loss to Lyon last month.</p>
    <p>City have the qual­ity in their squad to beat any­one – as they showed in a 4-0 rout of Liver­pool last sea­son – but does the Spa­niard have the hunger and abil­ity to make it hap­pen on a con­sis­tent ba­sis?</p>
    <p>City have brought in Dutch de­fender Nathan Ake and Span­ish winger Fer­ran Tor­res. Guardi­ola in­sists he will not com­plain if those are his only new sign­ings.</p>
    <p>“Since day one, the club does every­thing to do their best, not just for me, but for the team,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If we have to stay with the play­ers (we have) I’ll be happy. I’ve never be­fore, or in the fu­ture will I com­plain. I’m lucky to have th­ese play­ers and be in this club.”</p>
    <p>City’s fail­ure to re­place de­fender Vin­cent Kom­pany last year proved hugely detri­men­tal and his ab­sence was com­pounded by a longterm in­jury to Aymeric La­porte.</p>
    <p>With La­porte an un­likely starter today, hav­ing only re­turned to train­ing last Fri­day fol­low­ing a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test this month, Ake seems cer­tain to make his de­but while Tor­res is also in con­tention.</p>
    <p>How­ever, City’s record goalscorer Ser­gio Aguero is still re­cov­er­ing from the knee surgery that has side­lined him since June and could be two months away from a re­turn.</p>
