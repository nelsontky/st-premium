    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Once the high­est-rated se­ries in Amer­i­can ca­ble tele­vi­sion his­tory, The Walk­ing Dead is of­fi­cially on its last legs.</p>
    <p>The record-break­ing zom­bie show will con­clude in 2022 af­ter a mon­ster-sized 11th sea­son span­ning 24 episodes, net­work AMC said in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s been 10 years ‘gone bye’; what lies ahead are two more to come and sto­ries and sto­ries to tell be­yond that,” said co-cre­ator Scott Gim­ple.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2010, the post-apoc­a­lyp­tic hor­ror se­ries re­peat­edly shat­tered ca­ble au­di­ence records, peak­ing with the sea­son five pre­miere in 2014, which drew 17.3 mil­lion view­ers.</p>
    <p>But au­di­ences be­gan de­clin­ing steeply in 2017.</p>
    <p>While the flag­ship show is now be­ing killed off, the lu­cra­tive Walk­ing Dead fran­chise has a lengthy af­ter­life planned.</p>
    <p>AMC is forg­ing ahead with a new spin-off fo­cused on the char­ac­ters Daryl Dixon (Nor­man Ree­dus) and Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), to pre­miere in 2023.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate, an­thol­ogy-style se­ries will fea­ture stand­alone episodes or groups of episodes fo­cus­ing on in­di­vid­ual char­ac­ters – both ex­ist­ing favourites and new. No re­lease date was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Another spin-off, Fear The Walk­ing Dead, has been run­ning since 2015, and The Walk­ing Dead: World Be­yond – a new se­ries about the first gen­er­a­tion raised in the apoc­a­lypse – will de­but on Oct 4.</p>
    <p>The Walk­ing Dead uni­verse is based on a comic book about a zom­bie-rid­den vi­sion of the United States.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal se­ries cen­tred on Rick Grimes (An­drew Lin­coln), a sher­iff who wakes up from a coma to find the world over­run by the un­dead and goes on a search for other sur­vivors.</p>
    <p>Lin­coln left the show in 2018, but his char­ac­ter is due to star in stand­alone fea­ture films.</p>
    <p>The con­clud­ing episodes of sea­son 10 of The Walk­ing Dead have yet to air, af­ter pro­duc­ers in March re­vealed pro­duc­tion had been halted by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Six re­main­ing episodes from this sea­son are now sched­uled for early next year.</p>
    <p>AMC has en­joyed an un­prece­dented string of suc­cess­ful se­ries in re­cent years, in­clud­ing Mad Men (2007 to 2015) and Break­ing Bad (2008 to 2013) – which it­self gen­er­ated pop­u­lar spin-off Bet­ter Call Saul (2015 to present).</p>
