    <p>NEW YORK • Ms Con­nie Culp, the first pa­tient in the US to re­ceive a face trans­plant, has died at the Cleve­land Clinic which per­formed her pro­ce­dure in 2008. She was 57.</p>
    <p>She died last Wed­nes­day of com­pli­ca­tions from an in­fec­tion that was un­re­lated to her trans­plant, a spokesman for the hos­pi­tal said.</p>
    <p>The clinic con­firmed Ms Culp’s death on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Ms Culp was the long­est-liv­ing face trans­plant pa­tient in the world, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Dr Frank Pa­pay, chair­man of the Cleve­land Clinic’s Der­ma­tol­ogy and Plas­tic Surgery In­sti­tute, said:</p>
    <p>“She was a great pi­o­neer and her de­ci­sion to un­dergo a some­times daunt­ing pro­ce­dure is an en­dur­ing gift for all of hu­man­ity.” Dr Pa­pay was part of the sur­gi­cal team that per­formed the 23-hour op­er­a­tion which re­placed Ms Culp’s dam­aged face with that of a re­cently de­ceased woman.</p>
    <p>It was the most ex­ten­sive and com­pli­cated face trans­plant at the time. Three face trans­plants had been done be­fore Ms Culp’s: two in France and one in China.</p>
    <p>Ms Culp was shot by her hus­band, Thomas Culp, in 2004, dam­ag­ing most of her face and leav­ing her un­able to breathe or eat on her own.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, with whom she had a com­mon law mar­riage ac­cord­ing to Cleve­land news­pa­per The Plain</p>
    <p>Dealer, was sen­tenced to seven years in pri­son for ag­gra­vated at­tempted mur­der and re­leased in 2011. Af­ter shoot­ing his wife, Mr Culp turned the shot­gun on him­self, but only lost a few teeth and some of the vi­sion in his left eye.</p>
    <p>He still looked the same, Ms Culp told the pa­per in 2010.</p>
    <p>She said she had for­given her hus­band. “I still love my hus­band,” she told Good Morn­ing Amer­ica in 2009. “I for­gave him the day he did it. I have to.”</p>
    <p>Dr Thomas Romo, di­rec­tor of fa­cial plas­tic and re­con­struc­tive surgery at Lenox Hill Hos­pi­tal and</p>
    <p>Man­hat­tan Eye, Ear and Throat Hos­pi­tal, said around 40 such op­er­a­tions have been done world­wide since Ms Culp’s.</p>
    <p>Face trans­plants are more than just cos­metic im­prove­ments for pa­tients, Dr Romo said. Af­ter suc­cess­ful trans­plants, most pa­tients are able to speak, eat and oth­er­wise live a more nor­mal life.</p>
    <p>If not for the surgery, Ms Culp would not have been able to smile or talk, he said, adding that face trans­plants can have pos­i­tive psy­cho­log­i­cal ef­fects for pa­tients. Ms Culp is “a mile­stone in med­i­cal his­tory and will be for­ever”.</p>
