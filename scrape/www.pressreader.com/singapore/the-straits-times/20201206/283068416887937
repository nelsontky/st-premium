    <p>Do you know how much money you need to main­tain your life­style every month?</p>
    <p>Few peo­ple can an­swer this ques­tion straight away be­cause it can be a te­dious ex­er­cise to take note of every dol­lar that goes out day af­ter day.</p>
    <p>As long as most of us have enough money, we usu­ally don’t bother to jot down our ex­penses be­cause we are al­ready busy enough try­ing to keep up with our jobs and so on.</p>
    <p>But if you are keen to get an ac­cu­rate pic­ture of how much money you will need for re­tire­ment, you should per­haps do a one-month ex­per­i­ment to col­late your ac­tual ex­penses.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is that most of us would like to main­tain our ex­ist­ing life­style and to be able to do that, we need to know how much we ac­tu­ally spend. To do this ac­cu­rately, you need the sup­port of your spouse at least to take part, since re­tire­ment usu­ally in­volves a cou­ple’s ex­penses.</p>
    <p>An ef­fec­tive method is to en­sure that you col­lect re­ceipts for all kinds of ex­pen­di­ture such as gro­ceries, ca­sual shop­ping, petrol, park­ing charges, monthly car in­stal­ments, home main­te­nance, and telco and util­ity bills.</p>
    <p>Also note the money that goes out from your bank ac­count via Giro pay­ments such as in­sur­ance pre­mi­ums, as well as cash pay­ments for do­mes­tic helpers and other ex­penses.</p>
    <p>But you can dis­re­gard the pay­ment for taxes (since you will not be work­ing af­ter re­tire­ment), ex­penses for chil­dren (who would have grown up) and mort­gages (un­less your loan ten­ure is very long).</p>
    <p>Af­ter ad­ding up all the usual ex­penses, you should still top up the fig­ure with an ad­di­tional sum that can range from $500 to a few thou­sand dol­lars.</p>
    <p>This sum is meant to act as a buf­fer for un­ex­pected ex­penses such as re­pairs or med­i­cal bills, as well as to fac­tor in cer­tain an­nual ex­penses such as hol­i­days, birth­days and an­niver­saries. The fi­nal fig­ure should come as a bit of a shock to most peo­ple be­cause their first re­ac­tion is likely to be: “How am I go­ing to af­ford this if I stop work­ing?”</p>
    <p>The good news is that af­ter the ini­tial shock, the re­al­i­sa­tion should prompt you into think­ing how you should start plan­ning and man­age your fu­ture ex­penses bet­ter. This is nec­es­sary be­cause the OCBC sur­vey shows that those who do not plan are likely to be short by as much as 30 per cent of the money needed for their life­style.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, you should start by tak­ing a closer look at all your in­sur­ance poli­cies and see which ones to keep or cash in when you re­tire. This will lessen your pre­mium ex­penses by a lot.</p>
    <p>Re­tire­ment does not mean the end of get­ting any in­come; you should also check how you can rely on CPF Life, your other in­vest­ments as well as cash sav­ings to give you suf­fi­cient funds from 65.</p>
    <p>Know­ing what you are up against will al­low you to start do­ing some­thing to­day, such as di­vert­ing more money to your re­tire­ment kitty while cut­ting back on some of the non-es­sen­tial monthly ex­penses.</p>
    <p>A good start is to see how you can cut short your mort­gage ten­ure with lump sum redemp­tion.</p>
    <p>At the very least, you should re­duce the use of Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund to ser­vice your mort­gage as money out from CPF means you will have less for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Once you get into the habit of keep­ing tabs on your money, you will have taken the first step to hav­ing a good re­tire­ment. Af­ter all, you will most cer­tainly think more about sav­ing and think twice be­fore you spend the next dol­lar.</p>
    <p>Know­ing what you are up against will al­low you to start do­ing some­thing to­day, such as di­vert­ing more money to your re­tire­ment kitty while cut­ting back on some of the non-es­sen­tial monthly ex­penses.</p>
