    <p>WASHINGTON • As United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­mains hos­pi­talised at Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, one doc­tor is at the cen­tre of his treat­ment: Dr Sean Con­ley, the White House physi­cian.</p>
    <p>Here is what is known about Dr Con­ley.</p>
    <p>He be­came the Pres­i­dent’s physi­cian two years ago. Dr Con­ley took on the role of White House physi­cian in 2018, af­ter Dr Ronny Jack­son was nom­i­nated to be sec­re­tary of the De­part­ment of Vet­er­ans Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Dr Jack­son with­drew his name from con­sid­er­a­tion for that post amid ac­cu­sa­tions of in­ap­pro­pri­ate work­place be­hav­iour and was sub­se­quently pro­moted by Mr Trump to the po­si­tion of as­sis­tant to the Pres­i­dent and chief White House med­i­cal ad­viser. He is now run­ning for a House seat in Texas.</p>
    <p>In March 2018, Dr Con­ley was named act­ing White House physi­cian, and he was of­fi­cially ap­pointed to the po­si­tion by Mr Trump in May 2018.</p>
    <p>Dr Con­ley spe­cialises in os­teo­pathic medicine.</p>
    <p>He grad­u­ated from the Philadel­phia Col­lege of Os­teo­pathic Medicine in 2006, ac­cord­ing to records from the Vir­ginia Board of Medicine.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors of os­teo­pathic medicine tend to em­pha­sise com­mu­nity medicine and preven­tive care, take a more holis­tic ap­proach to medicine and rely heav­ily on phys­i­cal di­ag­no­sis com­pared with tra­di­tional doc­tors of medicine.</p>
    <p>Dr Con­ley, who re­ceived his Bach­e­lor of Sci­ence de­gree from the Univer­sity of Notre Dame, has served as an emer­gency doc­tor for the US Navy since 2006.</p>
    <p>A na­tive of Penn­syl­va­nia, he com­pleted his res­i­dency at the Naval Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Portsmouth, Vir­ginia, in 2013. Af­ter his res­i­dency,</p>
    <p>Dr Con­ley served as chief of trauma for the Nato Role 3 Multi­na­tional Med­i­cal Unit in Afghanista­n. He served as di­rec­tor of the med­i­cal cen­tre’s com­bat trauma re­search group for a lit­tle over two years.</p>
    <p>He sup­ported Mr Trump’s tak­ing hy­drox­y­chloro­quine.</p>
    <p>In May, Dr Con­ley gained at­ten­tion af­ter re­veal­ing that Mr Trump had started tak­ing hy­drox­y­chloro­quine, an anti-malaria drug, while un­der his care.</p>
    <p>Many ex­perts have ques­tioned the drug’s ef­fec­tive­ness in treat­ing, pre­vent­ing or cur­ing Covid-19, de­spite claims from Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion warned in April that the drug should be used only in clin­i­cal tri­als or in hos­pi­tals. The agency also said the drug could cause dan­ger­ous heart rhythm prob­lems.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter in May dis­cussing Mr Trump’s use of hy­drox­y­chloro­quine, Dr Con­ley said he and the Pres­i­dent had “con­cluded the po­ten­tial ben­e­fit from treat­ment out­weighed the rel­a­tive risks”.</p>
    <p>At a news con­fer­ence last Satur­day, the physi­cian told re­porters that Mr Trump was not tak­ing hy­drox­y­chloro­quine. “We dis­cussed it. He asked about it. He’s not on it now,” Dr Con­ley said.</p>
    <p>In March 2018, Dr Sean Con­ley was named act­ing White House physi­cian, and he was of­fi­cially ap­pointed to the po­si­tion by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in May 2018. Dr Con­ley spe­cialises in os­teo­pathic medicine. He grad­u­ated from the Philadel­phia Col­lege of Os­teo­pathic Medicine in 2006, ac­cord­ing to records from the Vir­ginia Board of Medicine.</p>
