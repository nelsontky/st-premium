    <p>When a mas­sive earth­quake struck Sichuan in 2008, so­cial worker Lim Boon Chee was help­ing HIV and Aids pa­tients in the Guangxi re­gion in south­ern China.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who was at the time work­ing for World Vi­sion In­ter­na­tional (China), trav­elled to ar­eas hit by the tem­blor in the south­west of the coun­try, and vol­un­teered to pro­vide psy­cho­log­i­cal first aid to vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Twice, she thought she was go­ing to die, but she braved the af­ter­shocks and made two trips to the re­gion – the first lasted about two weeks and the sec­ond was for a month.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ms Lim, 45, re­ceived the Out­stand­ing So­cial Worker Award for her tire­less ef­forts in help­ing vul­ner­a­ble groups in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas. She was among four so­cial work lead­ers who were hon­oured at a vir­tual cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>The award is the high­est ac­co­lade given to so­cial work­ers for their ex­em­plary achieve­ments in serv­ing the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of So­cial Work­ers, the vir­tual cer­e­mony was sup­ported by the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) and ExxonMo­bil Asia Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>In a speech at the cer­e­mony, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Yacob said so­cial work­ers have con­tin­ued to help people de­spite the lim­i­ta­tions im­posed by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>She said: “Many of you cre­atively lever­aged tech­nol­ogy to sus­tain reg­u­lar and re­mote en­gage­ment with clients. On the front line, so­cial work­ers adapted to the new safety mea­sures at your agen­cies and res­i­den­tial fa­cil­i­ties while con­tin­u­ing to pro­vide care to clients.</p>
    <p>“Your role as so­cial work­ers proved to be even more cru­cial in this time, by giv­ing care and sup­port to those who needed it the most.”</p>
    <p>She also made spe­cial men­tion of the ef­forts of med­i­cal so­cial work­ers, in­clud­ing one who helped a cou­ple who were among the first few pa­tients di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 here. The wife re­cov­ered, but her hus­band died from the in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal so­cial worker who was with the hus­band in his fi­nal days helped make sure he spent his last mo­ments with his wife and son through a video call.</p>
    <p>Said Madam Hal­imah: “Sub­se­quently, the so­cial worker pro­vided be­reave­ment sup­port to the wife, and went be­yond her call of duty to make funeral ar­range­ments for the pa­tient. The so­cial worker’s acts of com­pas­sion and courage, like so many oth­ers amongst you, have helped in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies tide through these ex­traor­di­nar­ily dif­fi­cult times.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who now works as prin­ci­pal med­i­cal so­cial worker and art psy­chother­a­pist at Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, said she never ex­pected to re­ceive the award.</p>
    <p>“When my col­league nom­i­nated me, I thought my ex­pe­ri­ence would be some­thing a bit dif­fer­ent, worth shar­ing with people. Like Doc­tors With­out Bor­ders, so­cial work­ers can also use their skills no mat­ter where they are.</p>
    <p>“The award is an hon­our and af­fir­ma­tion of the work I have done in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas.”</p>
    <p>Ms Bridget Mon­ica Das, head of psy­choso­cial ser­vices at Ren Ci Hos­pi­tal, was also given the Out­stand­ing So­cial Worker Award at the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin Sip­ing, se­nior so­cial worker and man­ager of the Child Pro­tec­tive Ser­vice at MSF, and Ms Lyon Koh Lin Lu, man­ager of the Sun Ray scheme at the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice, both re­ceived the Promis­ing So­cial Worker Award.</p>
    <p>Ms Long Chey May, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of So­cial Work­ers, said: “This year’s win­ners have shown im­mense com­mit­ment and in­flu­ence in their dif­fer­ent work set­tings... They are an in­spi­ra­tion to oth­ers to join the pro­fes­sion, and a re­minder to so­cial work­ers that ‘you can make a dif­fer­ence in some­one’s life’.”</p>
    <p>PLAY­ING A CRU­CIAL ROLE</p>
    <p>Your role as so­cial work­ers proved to be even more cru­cial in this time, by giv­ing care and sup­port to those who needed it the most.</p>
