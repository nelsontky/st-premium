    <p>•</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia of­fi­cials have or­dered thou­sands of ex­tra body bags as record coro­n­avirus cases left Los An­ge­les with fewer than 100 hospi­tal in­ten­sive care beds avail­able for a county of 10 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion has grown se­vere across south­ern parts of Cal­i­for­nia, which was praised for its re­sponse at the start of the pan­demic in spring, but has seen Covid-19-re­lated hospi­tal ad­mis­sions soar six­fold since mid-Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Deaths in the United States have passed the grim mile­stone of 300,000, with more than 16.7 mil­lion cases across the na­tion and over 248,000 in­fec­tions and 3,102 deaths on Tues­day alone.</p>
    <p>Be­yond Los An­ge­les, the health author­i­ties have sounded the alarm in nearby Ven­tura and River­side coun­ties, op­er­at­ing with 99 per cent and 100 per cent of in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) ca­pac­ity used up re­spec­tively. Am­bu­lance waits of up to five hours, be­fore pa­tients can be trans­ported to crowded hos­pi­tals, have been re­ported.</p>
    <p>“We just had to or­der 5,000 ad­di­tional body bags... that should be sober­ing,” said Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som on Tues­day, warn­ing that the state is “in the mid­dle of the most acute peak” of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want... to scare folks. But this is a deadly dis­ease, and we need to be mind­ful of where we are. We are not at the finish line yet,” he added.</p>
    <p>Al­though vac­ci­na­tions be­gan in sev­eral Cal­i­for­nia cities on Mon­day, the process is ex­pected to come too late to stem the state’s third wave of coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>With re­main­ing ICU ca­pac­ity across south­ern Cal­i­for­nia down to just 1.7 per cent, some ex­perts warned the lack of spe­cialised care could trig­ger a spike in mor­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>“Many folks may be think­ing this is just not any­thing to be re­ally wor­ried about be­cause hos­pi­tals can just add more beds – the re­al­ity is ev­ery bed needs to be staffed by highly trained and skilled health­care work­ers,” said Los An­ge­les County pub­lic health di­rec­tor Bar­bara Fer­rer.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have an end­less sup­ply of health­care work­ers, and those that are here sav­ing lives ev­ery day are ex­hausted.”</p>
    <p>Wors­en­ing mat­ters, of­fi­cials warned that daily cases and deaths could rise fur­ther as peo­ple con­tinue to gather for par­ties, in­door re­li­gious ser­vices and youth sport com­pe­ti­tions – all of which are tech­ni­cally banned.</p>
    <p>Most of Cal­i­for­nia’s res­i­dents were placed un­der a new kind of lock­down last week, with 33 mil­lion res­i­dents banned from gath­er­ings be­tween house­holds and for “non-es­sen­tial” ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“The num­bers are get­ting to be as­tro­nom­i­cal. Peo­ple are go­ing to die that don’t need to die,” Ven­tura County health of­fi­cer Robert Levin told the Los An­ge­les Times.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia has recorded more than 1.6 mil­lion coro­n­avirus cases and 21,000 deaths since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>Last week, Covid-19 killed an av­er­age of 163 peo­ple each day in Cal­i­for­nia, up from 41 a month ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Deaths in the United States have passed the grim mile­stone of 300,000, with more than 16.7 mil­lion cases across the na­tion and over 248,000 in­fec­tions and 3,102 deaths on Tues­day alone.</p>
