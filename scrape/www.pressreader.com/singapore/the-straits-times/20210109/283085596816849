    <p>Singer Pink cel­e­brated her 15th wed­ding an­niver­sary with a touch­ing trib­ute to hus­band Carey Hart.</p>
    <p>On the mile­stone date on Thurs­day, she posted a gallery of 10 pho­tos on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“15 years. Proud of us babe,” she wrote in the cap­tion to the pho­tos, which showed them at var­i­ous stages of their re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>There were pho­tos of them in their younger days, in­clud­ing him in a mo­hawk and them with their two chil­dren, Jameson Moon, four, and Wil­low Sage, nine.</p>
    <p>She added: “See, some­times be­ing stub­born pays off.”</p>
    <p>Per­haps re­fer­ring to Hart’s for­mer ca­reer as a mo­tor­cross racer or cur­rent one as an off-road truck racer, she also said: “What a wild ride it’s been, once we learnt how to stay in our race line.</p>
    <p>“Here’s to at least the next 15 months. I love you and I love our fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old singer, who burst onto the mu­sic scene in 2000, has openly spo­ken in the past about the dif­fi­cul­ties of mar­riage and how cou­ples ther­apy helped keep them to­gether, even when they were dat­ing.</p>
    <p>In 2008, the cou­ple had split up briefly, dur­ing which time she had pro­duced her hit al­bum Fun­house.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple laugh at us be­cause we’re ei­ther fight­ing or laugh­ing. They roll their eyes when we talk about ther­apy,” she wrote in an In­sta­gram post last Septem­ber, adding: “It’s worth it. All of it. Even when it isn’t.”</p>
    <p>She also wrote: “Mar­riage is aw­ful, won­der­ful, com­fort and rage. It is bor­ing, ter­ri­fy­ing and a to­tal nail biter.</p>
    <p>“It is lov­ing an­other fal­li­ble crea­ture while try­ing to love your­self. It is a life­time of com­ing back to the ta­ble.”</p>
