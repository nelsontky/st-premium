    <p>When Ms Mel Lim’s fam­ily could not get to­gether for Mother’s Day this year be­cause of the cir­cuit breaker, she got Sin­ga­porean co­me­dian and drag queen Ku­mar to lift their spir­its with a per­son­alised mes­sage.</p>
    <p>And when her four-year-old niece felt down about miss­ing school amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, Ms Lim got a woman dressed up as a Dis­ney princess – Frozen’s Elsa – to give her a nice sur­prise.</p>
    <p>All this was done over video with the help of Au­then­tic Celebrity Ex­pe­ri­ences (ACE), a new celebrity video plat­form that prom­ises cus­tomised fan in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old sales man­ager in a soft­ware tech­nol­ogy firm got to know about ACE through a friend in­volved in the com­pany.</p>
    <p>“You get a link to down­load the video and then you can send it to your friends or fam­ily,” says Ms Lim. She paid around $50 for each video, which lasted just un­der one minute.</p>
    <p>She pro­vided a short script for the tal­ent to read, but was im­pressed by the videos she re­ceived. “They free-style be­yond the script a lit­tle, so it is nice they are not just read­ing off the script.”</p>
    <p>This is part of a larger global trend in entertainm­ent to­wards in­di­vid­u­alised fan ex­pe­ri­ences, where fans can pay and re­quest celebri­ties to give them per­son­alised video mes­sages – sim­i­lar to apps like Cameo in North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-based ACE is aimed at the Asian mar­ket. It went live in Fe­bru­ary and has a line-up of 160 per­son­al­i­ties from around the re­gion and the United States, such as the cast of Net­flix re­al­ity se­ries Sell­ing Sun­set (2019 to present).</p>
    <p>Mr Dene Schonknech­t, ACE’s founder and a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent with a back­ground in e-com­merce, says: “It’s ba­si­cally celebri­ties meet e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>“The thing with fa­mous peo­ple is that you know them, they don’t know you. We’re try­ing to break down the bar­rier and change that re­la­tion­ship. Be­cause in front of the TV or with so­cial me­dia, in­ter­ac­tion with celebri­ties can be very onesided. With ACE, you’re guar­an­teed a per­sonal side.”</p>
    <p>Vet­eran co­me­dian and ac­tor Hos­san Leong, 51, who has done sev­eral ded­i­ca­tions via the ser­vice, says: “I thought (be­ing on ACE) would be an­other way I could con­nect with peo­ple who wanted a shout-out or a per­sonal ded­i­ca­tion from me, like a birth­day or a con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sage.”</p>
    <p>Mr Schonknech­t says about 80 per cent of the video re­quests are gifts – birth­day wishes or con­grat­u­la­tory or an­niver­sary mes­sages ad­dressed to some­one else, while the rest are for the celebri­ties to ad­dress the su­per­fans them­selves.</p>
    <p>The per­son­al­i­ties set the prices and they can go as low as $13 to $274 for more pop­u­lar stars like in­flu­encer Xi­axue, with ACE tak­ing a 25 per cent cut of the fee.</p>
    <p>The en­tre­pre­neur de­clined to spec­ify the num­ber of re­quests the ser­vice has re­ceived so far, but says there were five times more re­quests in July than in June.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Celebri­ties have been get­ting re­quests for these per­son­alised en­gage­ments any­way, over pri­vate chats and so on, so there has al­ways been a de­mand.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic also freed up the sched­ule of celebri­ties, which has helped to get more of them onto the plat­form.</p>
    <p>ACE an­nounced yes­ter­day it has raised $550,000 in pre-seed fund­ing from Manila An­gel In­vestors Net­work, tele­vi­sion host Max Loong and an­gel in­vestors hail­ing from Grab, Carousell, Ay­den Pay­ments and Google. It plans to use the money to scale its tal­ent and consumer base.</p>
