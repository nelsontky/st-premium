    <p>The SG Clean cam­paign, which was launched on Feb 16, was meant to “in­stil a na­tional ‘keep clean cul­ture’.”</p>
    <p>The cam­paign, which was co-opted in March to fight Covid-19, was also aimed at rais­ing pub­lic hy­giene stan­dards and en­cour­ag­ing in­di­vid­ual and so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity to main­tain clean­li­ness as Sin­ga­pore’s first line of de­fence to re­duce the spread of dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency an­nounced in March that it would train more than 2,000 SG Clean am­bas­sadors who would be pro­gres­sively de­ployed at hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops.</p>
    <p>They would en­cour­age pa­trons to re­turn their trays and keep ta­bles clean, as well as prac­tise good per­sonal hy­giene.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, then Min­is­ter for the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources, said in June that phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re-open­ing – where peo­ple can dine in at food out­lets – would be a test of whether habits can be changed.</p>
    <p>Din­ers are cur­rently be­ing re­minded by safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors to pick up af­ter them­selves at hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops. Mr Masa­gos has said the Gov­ern­ment may also con­sider hav­ing reg­u­la­tions to make this manda­tory.</p>
    <p>“We may even re­sort to reg­u­la­tions... we have to see how things evolve,” he said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times and Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao that was broad­cast on June 19.</p>
