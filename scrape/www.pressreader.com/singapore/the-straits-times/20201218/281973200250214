    <p>It was a re­mark­able, his­toric first: Early this week, the United States im­posed sanc­tions on Tur­key, a coun­try which is not only a long-stand­ing mem­ber of the Nato mil­i­tary al­liance in Europe, but also hosts Amer­i­can nu­clear weapons on its soil.</p>
    <p>And if this was not enough, the Euro­pean Union also slapped its own sanc­tions on Tur­key, a coun­try which, at least for­mally, has been an EU can­di­date mem­ber for more than half a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing epit­o­mises the twisted love-hate re­la­tion­ship be­tween Tur­key and the West bet­ter than these two episodes. And few for­eign pol­icy files are likely to prove more dif­fi­cult for US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den to han­dle than the ques­tion of Tur­key. For, as an Amer­i­can for­eign pol­icy com­men­ta­tor re­cently ob­served, the US-Turk­ish re­la­tion­ship re­sem­bles a slow-mo­tion train wreck, with the only con­so­la­tion that the trains are mov­ing more slowly than ini­tially feared to­wards their in­evitable crash. Yet when that crash comes, it will have far-reach­ing im­pli­ca­tions for global se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>TURK­ISH CEN­TRAL­ITY</p>
    <p>Tur­key’s strate­gic im­por­tance has sel­dom been more ev­i­dent. The coun­try strad­dles the di­vi­sion be­tween Europe and the Asian land mass. It bor­ders key Mid­dle East­ern coun­tries such as Syria, Iraq and Iran. It con­trols one of the most im­por­tant in­ter­na­tional wa­ter­ways. It sits on a ma­jor im­mi­gra­tion route, so no ef­fec­tive bor­der con­trol in Europe is fea­si­ble with­out its co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>And it is one of the world’s top 20 economies, only slightly smaller than the national econ­omy of In­done­sia, but far wealth­ier on a per capita ba­sis, since Tur­key’s pop­u­la­tion is less than a third of In­done­sia’s.</p>
    <p>Tur­key’s “soft power”, its abil­ity to at­tract and in­flu­ence other coun­tries in in­di­rect ways, is just as im­pres­sive. All the na­tions of Cen­tral Asia right up to the bor­ders of China – and, in­deed, the Uighurs inside China it­self – are eth­ni­cally and cul­tur­ally re­lated to the Turks.</p>
    <p>Rel­a­tively cheap, plen­ti­ful and much more at­tuned to lo­cal tastes, Turk­ish-made con­sumer goods dom­i­nate mar­kets in all these coun­tries. And the soap op­eras made by Turk­ish TV – par­tic­u­larly those hark­ing back to the glo­ries of the Ot­toman Em­pire stretch­ing back more than half a mil­len­nium – are wildly pop­u­lar through­out this vast Asian ex­panse, as well as in parts of south-east­ern Europe.</p>
    <p>It is not right to sug­gest – as some Turk­ish of­fi­cials claim – that their tense ties with the US and Europe to­day are be­cause their coun­try is headed by Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan, a man who be­lieves in the re­vival of Is­lamic val­ues and Is­lamic-based pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>True, the US and Euro­pean gov­ern­ments can be ac­cused of hypocrisy. For decades, they turned a blind eye to the hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions by Tur­key’s pre­vi­ous mil­i­tary rulers be­cause these were all pro-West­ern and tended to sup­press re­li­gious move­ments inside Tur­key, pre­cisely what the West con­sid­ered nec­es­sary then. Now, how­ever, the same West­ern gov­ern­ments crit­i­cise Pres­i­dent Er­do­gan’s al­leged hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions, even though he un­doubt­edly en­joys wide pop­u­lar sup­port in his coun­try.</p>
    <p>But it is equally a fact that many West­ern politi­cians – and par­tic­u­larly US pres­i­dents – have backed Mr Er­do­gan over the past two decades be­cause his form of po­lit­i­cal Is­lam ap­peared to be the model the West wanted to en­cour­age. For Tur­key stands as proof that Is­lam is fully com­pat­i­ble with tech­no­log­i­cal progress and in­no­va­tion, and that it is pos­si­ble to be both re­li­giously pi­ous and mar­ket-savvy, both a be­liever in so­cial jus­tice and an ar­dent pro­moter of the mar­ket econ­omy.</p>
    <p>That is why the EU and US gov­ern­ments have al­ways em­pha­sised Tur­key’s crit­i­cal im­por­tance, and why they have avoided over­act­ing, even when Mr Er­do­gan’s Tur­key pur­sued poli­cies con­trary to those of the West, in places such as Syria or Iran.</p>
    <p>WHAT HAS CHANGED?</p>
    <p>So, what has changed now? Es­sen­tially the sheer vol­ume of the dis­agree­ments be­tween Tur­key and its tra­di­tional West­ern al­lies, as well as Pres­i­dent Er­do­gan’s ap­par­ent de­ter­mi­na­tion to trans­late his coun­try’s soft-power as­sets into hard-power ones, in­clud­ing mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Con­sider the scale of Tur­key’s es­ca­lat­ing in­volve­ment in many crises: The Turk­ish mil­i­tary is in Syria, where it is pur­su­ing its own ob­jec­tives in that coun­try’s civil war. Tur­key is also dab­bling in the pol­i­tics of Iraq and claims for it­self a spe­cial role in deal­ing with Iran. Else­where in the Mid­dle East, Mr Er­do­gan has taken sides in the row be­tween Qatar and the other Gulf monar­chies led by Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>Mr Er­do­gan also sees him­self as the only pro­tec­tor of the Pales­tini­ans, the only leader able to stand up against Is­rael, re­cently be­rat­ing Arab coun­tries for es­tab­lish­ing diplo­matic links with Is­rael while con­ve­niently for­get­ting that Tur­key it­self has hosted an Is­raeli em­bassy since the Jewish state’s cre­ation.</p>
    <p>Far­ther afield, Tur­key is ship­ping weapons, money and – al­legedly – mer­ce­nar­ies from Syria in sup­port of the gov­ern­ment in Libya. It is chal­leng­ing the right of the is­land state of Cyprus – a chunk of which Turk­ish troops have oc­cu­pied since the 1970s – to drill for oil in the Mediter­ranean Sea. Mr Er­do­gan has also re­vived his ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes with neigh­bour­ing Greece.</p>
    <p>And, as if this were not enough, Tur­key was the key sup­porter of Azer­bai­jan in that coun­try’s re­cent war with Ar­me­nia; Az­eri troops were trained and equipped by Tur­key, and they would have never achieved the vic­tory they scored last month had it not been for the pre-plan­ning of the of­fen­sive by Pres­i­dent Er­do­gan him­self.</p>
    <p>How does the Turk­ish Pres­i­dent suc­ceed in keep­ing tabs on so many en­tan­gle­ments, never mind play­ing dif­fer­ent roles in each one of them? Partly be­cause he is a mas­ter of tim­ing, partly be­cause he knows when to push and when to cut his losses if the odds get too big for him, but largely be­cause he as­sumes – of­ten cor­rectly – that his op­po­nents have less at stake in each one of these con­flicts than he does, and there­fore Tur­key can af­ford to risk in­volve­ment, on the as­sump­tion that even if mat­ters turn out dis­as­trously wrong, he can ex­tri­cate him­self with lit­tle dam­age.</p>
    <p>There i s no ques­tion that the tac­tic worked. Tur­key is al­ready a more im­por­tant player in the</p>
    <p>Mid­dle East than any Arab gov­ern­ment, and with more po­lit­i­cal op­tions than Iran, the other ma­jor re­gional ac­tor.</p>
    <p>Tur­key has also suc­ceeded in po­si­tion­ing it­self as the key ar­biter on Rus­sia’s south­ern ap­proaches, largely be­cause of its sup­port for Azer­bai­jan in the cur­rent war. And the Turks re­tain the op­tion of re­tal­i­at­ing against Europe by sim­ply open­ing their bor­ders to large num­bers of mi­grants from the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>MIS­SILE MIS­STEP</p>
    <p>The snag for Mr Er­do­gan is that he ap­pears to have gone too far in these games. The dis­pute with the US which has now re­sulted in the im­po­si­tion of Amer­i­can sanc­tions started with Tur­key’s de­ci­sion to buy the S400 mis­sile de­fence sys­tem from Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>The Turk­ish Pres­i­dent ad­mits that this is an un­usual pur­chase for a coun­try mem­ber in the US-led Nato in Europe. But he claims that Greece – an­other Nato mem­ber state – also pur­chased Rus­sian equip­ment in the past, so Tur­key’s ac­tion is not un­prece­dented. Mr Er­do­gan also as­serts that his move to buy Rus­sian mis­siles was un­der­taken be­cause the US re­fused to sup­ply sim­i­lar sys­tems.</p>
    <p>But the re­al­ity is a bit dif­fer­ent. Rus­sia’s S400 mis­siles are so­phis­ti­cated sys­tems which, once op­er­ated by the Turks, can in­ter­fere with Nato’s air de­fences, and par­tic­u­larly with the so-called stealth tech­nol­ogy in Amer­ica’s F-35 lat­est gen­er­a­tion com­bat air­craft, a project in which Tur­key was in­volved from the start.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the US did not refuse to sup­ply Tur­key with al­ter­na­tives to Rus­sian-made mis­sile sys­tems; Wash­ing­ton merely re­fused Mr Er­do­gan’s de­mand that Tur­key should get the US pro­pri­etary tech­nol­ogy to man­u­fac­ture its own ver­sions of Amer­i­can mis­sile sys­tems.</p>
    <p>With no com­pro­mise in sight, the Turks have been ba­si­cally evicted by Wash­ing­ton from the F-35 fighter jet project, even though this has in­flicted fi­nan­cial losses on the US it­self. And, as Tur­key per­sisted with its de­ter­mi­na­tion to de­ploy the Rus­sian-made mis­sile sys­tems, it has now also been hit with ad­di­tional US mil­i­tary sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>THE STRATE­GIC CHAL­LENGE</p>
    <p>The real con­fronta­tion is not merely about a bit of Rus­sian equip­ment; it is about Tur­key’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to be­come a ma­jor weapons pro­ducer and sup­plier. Azer­bai­jan tri­umphed in last month’s war with Ar­me­nia largely thanks to Turk­ish-pro­duced un­manned ve­hi­cles, drones which pul­verised Ar­me­nia’s tanks and also sup­plied Azer­bai­jan’s troops with vi­tal bat­tle­field in­tel­li­gence. The episode is an in­di­ca­tion of just how far Tur­key has al­ready pro­gressed down the route of be­com­ing a ma­jor mil­i­tary pro­ducer, and Mr Er­do­gan is promis­ing far more.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that this can change the strate­gic equa­tion both on Europe’s vul­ner­a­ble south­ern ap­proaches and in the Mid­dle East; a Tur­key will­ing and ca­pa­ble of sup­ply­ing cut­ting-edge mil­i­tary tech­nol­ogy is an al­to­gether dif­fer­ent propo­si­tion from the Tur­key which un­til re­cently merely dab­bled in Mid­dle East­ern crises.</p>
    <p>That much is un­der­stood by the EU as well, which re­cently bowed to what it sees as the in­evitable by in­tro­duc­ing some sanc­tions against Tur­key for its be­hav­iour to­wards Cyprus and Greece.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tions were long de­manded by French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, who is in­censed by Tur­key’s be­hav­iour, but re­sisted un­til now by Ger­many, home to over four mil­lion peo­ple of Turk­ish de­scent, be­cause the Ger­mans tend to see Tur­key as a do­mes­tic rather than a for­eign pol­icy ques­tion. The fact that the Ger­mans ap­pear to have dropped their op­po­si­tion to the im­po­si­tion of sanc­tions is sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>For the mo­ment, both the Euro­pean and US sanc­tions are lim­ited in scope, and em­i­nently re­versible. But there ap­pears to be lit­tle chance of Pres­i­dent Er­do­gan com­pro­mis­ing, or of Tur­key aban­don­ing its quest to­wards the sta­tus of great mil­i­tary power, as well as a man­u­fac­turer of key mil­i­tary tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, the in­com­ing Bi­den pres­i­dency will not be able to duck the ques­tion ev­ery pre­vi­ous US ad­min­is­tra­tion sought to avoid: whether Tur­key can re­main Amer­ica’s ally, or will ul­ti­mately turn into a power the US would have to tackle, or even con­front.</p>
    <p>And when that choice is even­tu­ally made, it will also de­cide the fu­ture of the Mid­dle East and Europe’s south­ern ap­proaches.</p>
