    <p>The de­ci­sion to be­gin cruises to nowhere next month is im­por­tant for both eco­nomic and psy­cho­log­i­cal rea­sons. Cou­pled with re­cent an­nounce­ments about open­ing air travel bub­bles with coun­tries that have man­aged the Covid-19 pan­demic well, this lat­est move rep­re­sents another care­ful step in open­ing up the econ­omy. It also sig­nals a nascent re­turn to nor­malcy in a sec­tor that has been hit hard since the mid­dle of March, when Sin­ga­pore joined sev­eral coun­tries in clos­ing their ports to cruise ves­sels over fears that they may carry in­fected pas­sen­gers. On the psy­cho­log­i­cal front, the short jour­neys could help re­lease a pent-up de­sire to travel some­where and ex­pe­ri­ence some­thing touristy. Of course, that sat­is­fac­tion would be dif­fer­ent since the roundtrip cruises would not have ports of call.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the jour­neys of­fer Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents – which the cruises are re­stricted to – a wel­come feel of the seas af­ter months of hav­ing been de­prived of “over­seas” travel. Also, un­like the idea of air­line flights to nowhere, sea jour­neys last longer and rep­re­sent a dif­fer­ent ver­sion of staycation­s, which have grown in pop­u­lar­ity. These trips are be­ing pro­moted to help the tourism sec­tor, and to cater to con­sumers who want to spend a few days away from their homes which have dou­bled up as their offices. What­ever pro­vides emo­tional re­lease and helps the econ­omy in the process de­serves a fair go in these dis­mal times.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rate health safe­guards have been put in place. All pas­sen­gers have to be tested for Covid-19 prior to board­ing and will have to com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures, such as mask-wear­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing. Tours will op­er­ate at a re­duced ca­pac­ity of 50 per cent, crew will be tested, the pres­ence of fresh air must be en­sured through­out the ship, and there must be emer­gency re­sponse plans for in­ci­dents re­lated to Covid-19. The con­tin­gency plans, in the event of an in­fec­tion or out­break, in­clude iso­lat­ing in­fected pas­sen­gers and their close con­tacts, ceas­ing on-board ac­tiv­i­ties, and hav­ing the ship re­turn to Sin­ga­pore. These plans draw on the hardlearnt lessons of cruises that be­came in­cu­ba­tors of Covid-19 in the early months of this year, be­fore the na­ture of the dis­ease and the steps needed to con­tain it on board be­came clear.</p>
    <p>Clearly, no one wants these cruises to be­come a fresh source of con­ta­gion. In one view, a sea cruise is a safe bub­ble, safer than even staycation­s. But oth­ers have ex­pressed con­cern over the thought of be­ing on board the same ship with the same peo­ple for a few days. Given that two cruise lines will be part of the pi­lot scheme, how well they, their crew and pas­sen­gers nav­i­gate through the safety re­stric­tions will pro­vide a use­ful gauge of the vi­a­bil­ity of these cruises to nowhere in gen­eral. In­deed, the even­tual re­sump­tion of cruises to some­where will ben­e­fit from this ini­tia­tive.</p>
