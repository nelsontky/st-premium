    <p>A wear­able de­vice that im­proves out­comes for knee surgery pa­tients, in­vented in Sin­ga­pore, has been short­listed for the top James Dyson Award prize.</p>
    <p>The de­vice, named Kimia, in­vented by Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ates Aaron Ramzeen, 26, and Ricky Guo, 30, made it to the short­list of the top 20 from among nearly 1,800 en­tries sub­mit­ted from around the world.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy firm Dyson said that de­spite chal­lenges brought about by the pan­demic, stu­dents col­lab­o­rated vir­tu­ally to come up with in­spir­ing so­lu­tions to global prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The na­ture of the en­tries re­flects a global sol­i­dar­ity among young in­ven­tors to­wards is­sues such as health and sus­tain­abil­ity, it added.</p>
    <p>Kimia is a de­vice at­tached to the knee and gives feed­back to phys­io­ther­a­pists on whether re­cov­er­ing pa­tients are do­ing the pre­scribed ex­er­cises reg­u­larly and cor­rectly.</p>
    <p>This means ther­a­pists can keep track of a pa­tient’s re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion jour­ney and de­liver ev­i­dence­based per­son­alised pre­scrip­tions re­motely.</p>
    <p>Un­like other de­vices, Kimia uses a pro­pri­etary flex­i­ble sen­sor that en­sures highly ac­cu­rate and con­sis­tent data col­lec­tion that clin­i­cians can rely on to track their pa­tients’ progress, said the in­ven­tors.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Kimia, some of the other in­ven­tions that made it to the top 20 list in­clude a re­cy­clable glove gen­er­a­tion unit called Re­glove and a de­vice that cap­tures and re­cy­cles tyre wear pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The top prize win­ner, who will re­ceive £30,000 (S$52,650), will be hand­picked by cre­ator and Dyson founder James Dyson him­self.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier interview with The Straits Times, Mr Dyson said that if de­vel­oped well, there is a huge in­ter­na­tional mar­ket for Kimia as any­one with knee prob­lems would find the de­vice use­ful.</p>
    <p>He was also im­pressed with young peo­ple’s zeal to help the less for­tu­nate in so­ci­ety and their con­cern for the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The award, which was started 15 years ago to en­cour­age stu­dents to use their en­gi­neer­ing and de­sign skills to solve prob­lems, has in­flu­enced en­gi­neer­ing schools in Bri­tain to in­clude de­sign think­ing in train­ing en­gi­neers.</p>
