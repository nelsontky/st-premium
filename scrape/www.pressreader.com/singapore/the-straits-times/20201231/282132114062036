    <p>When Mr Joe Bi­den takes the US pres­i­den­tial oath of of­fice on Jan 20, a new chap­ter in re­la­tions be­tween the su­per­power and South-east Asia will be­gin.</p>
    <p>After four tem­pes­tu­ous years of an Amer­ica un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, much of the re­gion is ready for some sta­bil­ity and con­sis­tency in its ties with the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has given no­tice that “Amer­ica is back, ready to lead the world”. In­stead of go­ing it alone, as was the pen­chant of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, he has sig­nalled that he will be look­ing to work with al­lies and part­ners as the US com­petes with China strate­gi­cally in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion and else­where in the world. In an ar­ti­cle last year in For­eign Af­fairs mag­a­zine, Mr Bi­den pledged to “build a united front of US al­lies and part­ners to con­front China’s abu­sive be­hav­iours and hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>There re­mains some anx­i­ety in South-east Asia, how­ever, that the re­gion might be over­looked as the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion em­barks on its mis­sion to re­build ties with its al­lies and part­ners in Asia.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Chan Heng Chee, Sin­ga­pore’s for­mer am­bas­sador to the US, noted re­cently at a we­bi­nar that when the US talks about its Asia pol­icy, it is re­ally look­ing at North-east Asia. The US is ob­sessed with China, Ja­pan and South Korea. South-east Asia, on the other hand, is not gen­er­ally on Wash­ing­ton’s radar screen, she ob­served.</p>
    <p>While Pres­i­dent Barack Obama made ef­forts to re­dress that over­sight, Mr Trump paid much less heed, as re­flected in his ab­sence at the re­gion’s key sum­mits. “There is not a real ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the role of Asean,” said Prof Chan.</p>
    <p>For­mer Aus­tralian diplo­mat</p>
    <p>John McCarthy agrees with this view. “Since the Sec­ond World War, the pri­mary fo­cus of the US in Asia has been, with the ex­cep­tion of the Viet­nam era, on North-east Asia, where the in­ter­ests of the re­gion’s big­gest pow­ers in­ter­sect,” he wrote re­cently for the Asialink web­site. But, he added, the US must now place equal weight on South-east Asia if it is to ef­fec­tively man­age the more ad­verse ef­fects of China’s rise.</p>
    <p>There is some op­ti­mism to be had that Mr Bi­den’s picks for sec­re­tary of state and na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser, Mr Antony Blinken and Mr Jake Sul­li­van, re­spec­tively, were both in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion that, as</p>
    <p>Prof Chan put it, placed South-east Asia on Wash­ing­ton’s radar screen.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is how much at­ten­tion they and their col­leagues will pay to the re­gion, and whether they will un­der­stand that it has changed in the last four years and would need reac­quaint­ing in or­der for the two sides to work well to­gether.</p>
    <p>As for the re­gion, there is a need to tem­per its expectatio­ns of the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, given that the US, too, has changed and that the di­vi­sive­ness of its pol­i­tics has meant a nar­rower space for for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>THE FIRST PIVOT AND WHAT HAS CHANGED</p>
    <p>The Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s pivot to Asia was announced as pol­icy in late 2011.</p>
    <p>But be­fore that, it was al­ready in­creas­ing its en­gage­ment with South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>This was partly in re­sponse to China’s new as­sertive­ness in South-east Asia in the lat­ter half of the noughties, par­tic­u­larly from 2009. That was the year when Bei­jing sub­mit­ted to the United Na­tions a map with a nine-dash line mark­ing out China’s mar­itime claims over al­most the en­tire South China Sea. China has over­lap­ping ter­ri­to­rial claims in the vi­tal wa­ters with four Asean states as well as Tai­wan. The fol­low­ing year, the Chi­nese be­gan re­fer­ring to the wa­ters as their “core in­ter­est”, a term they had till then used only in ref­er­ence to Tai­wan and Ti­bet.</p>
    <p>The US, with then Sec­re­tary of State Hil­lary Clin­ton at the helm of for­eign pol­icy, re­sponded by step­ping up en­gage­ment with the re­gion.</p>
    <p>In 2009, the US signed the Treaty of Amity and Co­op­er­a­tion with Asean; in 2010, the US be­came the first non-Asean coun­try to ap­point an am­bas­sador to the group­ing’s Sec­re­tariat in Jakarta; in 2011, it joined the</p>
    <p>East Asia Sum­mit (EAS), a plat­form for Asean to en­gage coun­tries with an in­ter­est in the re­gion. This was sig­nif­i­cant in that the US had ex­pressed scep­ti­cism about the EAS when it was formed in 2005.</p>
    <p>In July 2009, the US launched the Lower Mekong Ini­tia­tive (LMI) with the aim of help­ing the lower river­ine bor­der states of</p>
    <p>Cam­bo­dia, Laos, Thai­land and Viet­nam in ar­eas such as health, ed­u­ca­tion, en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion and in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment. Myan­mar joined the LMI in 2012.</p>
    <p>On the eco­nomic front, the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion pushed for the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP) free trade deal that in­volved 12 na­tions on both sides of the Pa­cific, in­clud­ing sev­eral Asean states, which was signed in Fe­bru­ary 2016.</p>
    <p>It was also un­der Mr Obama that the US started free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion and over­flight op­er­a­tions in the South China Sea from 2013 to counter what it saw as China’s ex­ces­sive claims in the dis­puted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>How­ever, that en­gage­ment with South-east Asia lost mo­men­tum in Mr Obama’s sec­ond term as the new sec­re­tary of state John Kerry turned his at­ten­tion to the Mid­dle East, and as Wash­ing­ton sought China’s co­op­er­a­tion on var­i­ous is­sues in­clud­ing cli­mate change and the Iran nu­clear pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Things de­te­ri­o­rated un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, be­gin­ning with the US with­drawal from the TPP. Mr Trump, after leav­ing his first EAS in 2017 early, failed to show up in sub­se­quent years in a re­gion where face-to-face meet­ings of lead­ers are im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>It did not help that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had trade dis­putes with many Asean states, in­clud­ing Viet­nam and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>While the US increased the fre­quency of free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions and stepped up scru­tiny of Chi­nese dams along the Mekong – help­ing the Mekong coun­tries push back against China’s control of wa­ter re­sources – the sense among coun­tries in the re­gion dur­ing the Trump years is that of ne­glect by the US.</p>
    <p>This made South-east Asian coun­tries less likely to see the US as a part­ner and “more de­pen­dent on China”, wrote in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions ex­pert Muham­mad Zul­fikar Rakhmat from Univer­si­tas Is­lam In­done­sia re­cently on the news anal­y­sis web­site, The Con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Change looks likely, how­ever, with the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion’s pledge to work with al­lies and part­ners.</p>
    <p>If a tweet from Mr Blinken in Au­gust con­grat­u­lat­ing Asean on its 53rd an­niver­sary is any­thing to go by, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion does in­tend to re-en­gage South-east Asia. He wrote: “Asean is es­sen­tial to tack­ling ma­jor chal­lenges like cli­mate change and global health, and cen­tral to South-east Asia’s pros­per­ity and se­cu­rity. Pres­i­dent Bi­den will show up and en­gage Asean on crit­i­cal is­sues of com­mon in­ter­est.”</p>
    <p>The mes­sage is cer­tain to go down well in the re­gion, which gen­er­ally wants the US to be present as a coun­ter­weight to a China that is grow­ing in its com­pre­hen­sive power and not coy about us­ing it, par­tic­u­larly its eco­nomic clout, to pressure other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But Mr Blinken and Mr Sul­li­van – who was deputy chief of staff to Mrs Clin­ton when she was sec­re­tary of state – as well as their col­leagues must re­alise that the Asean of to­day is not the same as it was four years ago.</p>
    <p>The re­gion has be­come more en­meshed eco­nom­i­cally with China than be­fore, through trade and in­vest­ment, as well as in­fra­struc­ture projects un­der the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI). Asean has just signed the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship with China and four other coun­tries, a de­vel­op­ment that will draw the group­ing closer into the Chi­nese eco­nomic or­bit.</p>
    <p>And while Asean was be­com­ing di­vided on how to deal with China back in 2016, it is even more so now.</p>
    <p>As pointed out by Mr McCarthy, Cam­bo­dia, Laos and Myan­mar tilt to­wards China, while In­done­sia, Thai­land and Sin­ga­pore do not want to choose be­tween the two great pow­ers. The Philip­pines, he wrote, wants Amer­i­can prox­im­ity when it feels vul­ner­a­ble while Viet­nam at­taches real im­por­tance to a strong US strate­gic pres­ence.</p>
    <p>OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES FOR CLOSER TIES</p>
    <p>This means that the US will have to cal­i­brate care­fully its poli­cies to­wards the dif­fer­ent Asean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has said that he would not en­ter into any new trade agree­ments un­til his ad­min­is­tra­tion has equipped Amer­i­cans to suc­ceed in the global econ­omy. But that looks to be a long-haul pro­ject dur­ing which time the world, in­clud­ing China and South-east Asia, would have moved on.</p>
    <p>De­spite the do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal pres­sures, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion should con­sider re­viv­ing at some point US mem­ber­ship in the TPP – now known as the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship – as a way of coun­ter­ing China’s eco­nomic in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>In the in­terim, it can boost the work of the In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Fi­nance</p>
    <p>Cor­po­ra­tion (DFC), the US’ an­swer to the BRI. The DFC, started dur­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and op­er­a­tional from Jan­uary last year, is a de­vel­op­ment bank that part­ners the pri­vate sec­tor to fi­nance projects in low- and lower-mid­dle-in­come coun­tries in sec­tors such as health­care, crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture and en­ergy.</p>
    <p>There are other ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion can de­velop that will strengthen US ties with the re­gion such as cli­mate change, public health, tech­nol­ogy and ed­u­ca­tion, all vi­tal is­sues among the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries of the re­gion. It can do so through ex­ist­ing mech­a­nisms such as the LMI and the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Control and Pre­ven­tion’s net­work of of­fices in the re­gion, as well as by build­ing new ones.</p>
    <p>THE CON­STRAINTS</p>
    <p>But the re­gion should also recog­nise that the US, at this junc­ture, has many do­mes­tic prob­lems – a chaotic power tran­si­tion, an out-of-control Covid-19 pan­demic and an eco­nomic cri­sis – that need to be dealt with im­me­di­ately, and which will slow down its re-en­gage­ment with the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will also be con­strained, both by the di­vi­sive­ness of Amer­ica’s do­mes­tic pol­i­tics as well as its own val­ues-based diplo­macy. Mr Bi­den has spo­ken about fight­ing cor­rup­tion, de­fend­ing against au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism and ad­vanc­ing hu­man rights at a time when the re­gion is see­ing what some an­a­lysts have termed as “demo­cratic back­slid­ing”.</p>
    <p>South-east Asian coun­tries should be pa­tient and, at the same time, be proac­tive in en­gag­ing Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The work of re-en­gage­ment may be la­bo­ri­ous and un­ex­cit­ing, but it is such nuts-and-bolts ef­forts that will go a long way to­wards strength­en­ing ties be­tween the US and the re­gion, and that can only be a good thing for both sides.</p>
    <p>De­spite the do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal pres­sures, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion should con­sider re­viv­ing at some point US mem­ber­ship in the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship – now known as the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship – as a way of coun­ter­ing China’s eco­nomic in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>In the in­terim, it can boost the work of the In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion, the US’ an­swer to the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive.</p>
