    <p>OFF­SET DE­TAINED BY PO­LICE ON IN­STA­GRAM LIVE: Rap­per Off­set of the group Mi­gos was de­tained and re­leased last Satur­day in Bev­erly Hills, fol­low­ing an in­ci­dent that re­port­edly in­volved United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s sup­port­ers, who were march­ing in the area.</p>
    <p>In the In­sta­gram Live video (above), Off­set, 28, can be heard say­ing he is not go­ing to move his hands from the steer­ing wheel, while of­fi­cers ap­proach and tell him to switch off his car en­gine.</p>
    <p>One of them says: “We were told that you guys were wav­ing guns at peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Later, an of­fi­cer tells Off­set not to move and reaches into the rap­per’s ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>“That’s not le­gal. You can’t just open my door,” Off­set says.</p>
    <p>“You just watched some­body beat my car up with a flag.</p>
    <p>What are you talk­ing about?” the rap­per adds.</p>
    <p>Off­set is one-third of Grammy-nom­i­nated group</p>
    <p>Mi­gos, along with Take­off and Quavo. He is mar­ried to chart-top­ping rap­per Cardi B.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the Bev­erly Hills Po­lice Depart­ment con­firmed the ar­rest of a 20-year-old man named Marcelo Al­man­zar – who was also in the car – on two charges of car­ry­ing a con­cealed weapon and car­ry­ing a loaded firearm in public.</p>
    <p>The bail for Al­man­zar, who has the same last name as</p>
    <p>Cardi B and is her cousin, said tabloid news web­site TMZ, was set at US$35,000 (S$47,500).</p>
