    <p>The dis­cov­ery of a new­born dumped at a Doha air­port last month, which led to fe­male pas­sen­gers – many of them Aus­tralians – un­der­go­ing strip searches and phys­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tions, trig­gered global out­rage and strained ties be­tween Qatar and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Qatar said the par­ents of the aban­doned baby girl had been iden­ti­fied and ef­forts were un­der way to ar­rest the mother who was from an Asian coun­try. Agence France-Presse said that for Qatar, this ref­er­ence typ­i­cally means a South Asian coun­try.</p>
    <p>The wo­man, who is not in the emi­rate, has been charged with at­tempted mur­der.</p>
    <p>An un­spec­i­fied num­ber of air­port po­lice of­fi­cers who or­dered the body searches also face crim­i­nal charges, but the spe­cific na­ture of the charges was not pro­vided by pub­lic prose­cu­tors, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>The baby, who sur­vived, was dis­cov­ered on Oct 2, wrapped in plas­tic and aban­doned in a bath­room rub­bish bin, prompt­ing a lock­down of Ha­mad In­ter­na­tional Air­port as the au­thor­i­ties searched for the mother.</p>
    <p>Women on 10 Qatar Air­ways flights leav­ing Doha – in­clud­ing at least 13 Aus­tralians – were then led from air­craft to am­bu­lances on the tar­mac where they were sub­jected to strip searches and in­va­sive med­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tions to see if they had re­cently given birth.</p>
    <p>WHY IT MAT­TERS?</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent came to light af­ter af­fected Aus­tralian pas­sen­gers spoke out and re­ports said Bri­tish, New Zealand and French cit­i­zens were sub­jected to the searches.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent trig­gered diplo­matic ten­sions as Qatar did not im­me­di­ately apol­o­gise.</p>
    <p>The tiny Gulf na­tion faced in­ter­na­tional con­dem­na­tion led by Aus­tralia, whose Prime Min­is­ter Scott</p>
    <p>Mor­ri­son called the searches “ap­palling”. Hu­man rights groups said the searches could con­sti­tute sex­ual as­sault. The crit­i­cism led to a back­lash on­line against sta­te­owned Qatar Air­ways and threats to refuse ser­vice or re­fu­elling to its jets at Aus­tralia air­ports.</p>
    <p>Late last month, Qatar apol­o­gised for the in­ci­dent and said in­ves­ti­ga­tions were on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent also res­ur­rected crit­i­cism, par­tic­u­larly in the West, about treat­ment of women in the con­ser­va­tive Mus­lim na­tion where, among other things, it is il­le­gal to be­come preg­nant out­side of mar­riage.</p>
    <p>It also raised the ques­tion of whether for­eign women trav­el­ling through the air­port in Qatar could legally be sub­ject to the same laws, and to in­va­sive and po­ten­tially non-con­sen­sual pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S NEXT?</p>
    <p>Qatar Air­ways in Septem­ber re­ported losses of US$1.9 bil­lion (S$2.6 bil­lion) in the past year, cit­ing the pan­demic as among the pri­mary rea­sons, but the in­ci­dent could also po­ten­tially lead to dam­age to the air­line’s brand.</p>
    <p>Since the in­ci­dent, Qatar has re­peat­edly vowed to guar­an­tee the fu­ture “safety and se­cu­rity” of pas­sen­gers and has said it was look­ing at “po­ten­tial gaps in the pro­ce­dures and pro­to­cols” at the air­port.</p>
    <p>With the na­tion set to host the 2022 Fifa World Cup, the mat­ter has dealt a blow to its on­go­ing ef­forts and strug­gle to re­as­sure crit­ics that its prom­ises on women’s rights, labour re­la­tions and democ­racy are cred­i­ble.</p>
