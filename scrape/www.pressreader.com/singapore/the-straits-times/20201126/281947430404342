    <p>•</p>
    <p>France will re­quire on­line tech­nol­ogy giants to pay a new “dig­i­tal tax” on their 2020 earn­ings, the Finance Min­istry said yes­ter­day, de­spite the United States warn­ing that it could re­tal­i­ate with new tar­iffs on French im­ports.</p>
    <p>“The com­pa­nies sub­ject to this tax have been no­ti­fied,” a min­istry of­fi­cial said, re­fer­ring in par­tic­u­lar to the Amer­i­can firms Google, Ama­zon, Face­book and Ap­ple, which the US says are be­ing un­fairly tar­geted by the levy.</p>
    <p>The French move risks es­ca­lat­ing a long-run­ning fight over how to make US tech multi­na­tion­als pay a larger share of their taxes in the coun­tries where they op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Un­der Euro­pean Union law, US com­pa­nies can de­clare their prof­its from across the bloc in a sin­gle mem­ber state – in most cases low-tax ju­ris­dic­tions such as Ire­land or the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>Un­der pres­sure to take a harder line, France en­acted its dig­i­tal tax last year, which calls for a 3 per cent levy on prof­its from pro­vid­ing on­line sales for third-party re­tail­ers, as well as on dig­i­tal ad­ver­tis­ing and the sale of pri­vate data.</p>
    <p>But Paris reached a deal with the ad­min­is­tra­tion of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to sus­pend the tax while seek­ing a global dig­i­tal tax deal un­der the aus­pices of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD).</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has threat­ened puni­tive du­ties of 25 per cent on US$1.3 bil­lion (S$1.75 bil­lion) worth of French prod­ucts, in­clud­ing the coun­try’s renowned cos­met­ics and hand­bags.</p>
    <p>Last month, the OECD ac­knowl­edged that it would not reach a deal on a new global stan­dard for tax­ing dig­i­tal firms this year as it had hoped, largely be­cause of US op­po­si­tion to the pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>The OECD had ear­lier ne­go­ti­ated the first ma­jor rewrit­ing of tax rules in more than a gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But the fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has also left finance min­istries most fo­cused on sav­ing their economies.</p>
    <p>Europe has long pushed to make hugely prof­itable large tech com­pa­nies do­ing busi­ness over the In­ter­net pay tax where they sell their ser­vices, rather than in tax havens de­lib­er­ately cho­sen un­der what is called “ag­gres­sive tax op­ti­mi­sa­tion”.</p>
