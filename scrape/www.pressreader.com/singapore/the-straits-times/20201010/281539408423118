    <p>Sin­ga­porean writer-di­rec­tor Ken Kwek has won the Hed­wig Anuar Chil­dren’s Book Award for his 2019 novel, Kelly And The Krumps, to­gether with emerg­ing il­lus­tra­tor Lolita Chiong. Judges praised Kwek’s “keen un­der­stand­ing of the lo­cal child’s world” and Chiong’s “tongue-in-cheek il­lus­tra­tions”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean writer-di­rec­tor Ken Kwek, known for con­tro­ver­sial films, has won a prom­i­nent chil­dren’s book prize.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the 41-year-old won the Hed­wig Anuar Chil­dren’s Book Award for his 2019 novel, Kelly And The Krumps, to­gether with emerg­ing il­lus­tra­tor Lolita Chiong.</p>
    <p>Kelly, a school­girl faced with the pres­sure of the im­pend­ing Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE), se­cretly joins a hip-hop crew and at­tempts to win a dance com­pe­ti­tion to pay off the debts of her twin brother, who has fallen foul of an on­line gam­ing syn­di­cate.</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial award for chil­dren’s lit­er­a­ture, named for the first Sin­ga­porean di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Library of Sin­ga­pore, was given out this year in a vir­tual cer­e­mony at the close of the first dig­i­tal edi­tion of the Asian Fes­ti­val of Chil­dren’s Con­tent.</p>
    <p>Its or­gan­is­ers, the Sin­ga­pore Book Coun­cil, re­duced the cash prize from the usual $10,000 to $3,000 each for the win­ning writer and il­lus­tra­tor, cit­ing the eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The prize, which is for Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents, re­ceived a record 87 sub­mis­sions this year – a 33 per cent in­crease from 2018 – which were whit­tled down into a short­list of six.</p>
    <p>This year’s judges were Na­tional In­sti­tute of Education lec­turer Donna Lim and il­lus­tra­tors Charles San­toso and Lee Kow Fong. Lee is bet­ter known by his pseu­do­nym Ah Guo. They praised Kwek’s “keen un­der­stand­ing of the lo­cal child’s world” and Chiong’s “tongue-incheek il­lus­tra­tions”.</p>
    <p>Kwek is most recog­nised for his adult ma­te­rial, such as satir­i­cal films Un­lucky Plaza (2014) and Sex. Vi­o­lence.Fam­i­lyValues, which was banned in 2012 and later re­in­stated with an R21 rating af­ter ed­its.</p>
    <p>He also wrote This Is What Hap­pens To Pretty Girls, a play about sex­ual mis­con­duct, which was staged last year.</p>
    <p>In 2018, how­ever, he dove into the more in­nocu­ous arena of mid­dle­grade books with his best-sell­ing de­but novel Ti­mothy And The Phub­bers – which, like Kelly And The Krumps, was il­lus­trated by Chiong and deals with the im­pact of screen cul­ture on chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“Phub­bers”, a port­man­teau of “phone” and “snub­ber”, refers to those who ig­nore oth­ers in a so­cial set­ting in favour of their phones.</p>
    <p>“For the first time in his­tory, we have a whole gen­er­a­tion of chil­dren grow­ing up with a screen cul­ture that is ubiq­ui­tous and ad­dic­tive and which ma­nip­u­lates their de­sires and self-im­age in ways that can be in­cred­i­bly un­healthy,” says Kwek, who is mar­ried to ac­tress Pam Oei with a son, nine.</p>
    <p>He got the idea for Kelly’s dance crew from a hip-hop class his son at­tended.</p>
    <p>“I met kids from very dif­fer­ent cul­tural back­grounds, with a di­ver­sity of styles. There was the nerdy Chi­nese kid with specs, the funky Malay boy with spiky hair, the Ja­panese girl who dresses like a manga char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>“Yet, as a hip-hop crew, they achieved a kind of alchemy, com­bin­ing team­work and syn­chronic­ity with freestylin­g in­di­vid­u­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>He also wanted to look at ex­am­i­na­tion pres­sure.</p>
    <p>“PSLE stress – you went through it, I went through it, my son will go through it. But to­day’s kids, and their par­ents, are more mis­er­able than ever be­fore, with many feel­ing com­pelled to put them­selves through the wringer of a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar tu­ition in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“This book brings comic re­lief to a painful rite of pas­sage ev­ery Sin­ga­porean child goes through to­day.”</p>
    <p>He turned to chil­dren’s fic­tion for the sake of his son, he says.</p>
    <p>“I wrote these chil­dren’s books to make him and his friends laugh. I want to de­light.”</p>
