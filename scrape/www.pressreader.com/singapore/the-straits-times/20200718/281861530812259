    <p>• Large parts of China were reel­ing yes­ter­day from the worst floods in decades, as dis­rup­tions mounted for sup­ply chains, in­clud­ing for per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) vi­tal in the fight against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral city of Wuhan and the prov­inces of An­hui, Jiangxi and Zhe­jiang de­clared red alerts as heavy rains swelled rivers and lakes.</p>
    <p>Wuhan, on the banks of the Yangtze river where the coro­n­avirus emerged late last year, warned res­i­dents to take pre­cau­tions as wa­ter lev­els fast ap­proached their max­i­mum guar­an­teed safety level.</p>
    <p>The sum­mer rainy sea­son brings floods to China al­most ev­ery year but the im­pact of the dis­rup­tion they cause is be­ing felt far­ther afield as Chi­nese goods be­come more im­por­tant in global sup­ply chains for var­i­ous items, in­clud­ing PPE.</p>
    <p>“It’s just cre­at­ing an­other ma­jor road­block here in terms of PPE get­ting into the United States – it is the worst of times for it to hap­pen, but that’s what we’re deal­ing with right now,” said Mr Michael Ein­horn, pres­i­dent of Dealmed, a US med­i­cal sup­ply dis­trib­u­tor, which sources dis­pos­able lab coats and other prod­ucts from Wuhan and nearby re­gions.</p>
    <p>“We can­not get prod­ucts out for over a week, which is a very long time i n our busi­ness,” he said, adding that the de­lays could last up to three weeks.</p>
    <p>Xiantao, just west of Wuhan, is China’s big­gest man­u­fac­turer of non-woven fab­rics used in PPE pro­duc­tion. A third of China’s to­tal ex­ports of non-woven fab­ric prod­ucts come from the city.</p>
    <p>At least 141 peo­ple have ei­ther died or gone miss­ing as heavy rains which started last month forced nearly 15 mil­lion peo­ple to be evac­u­ated from their homes this month alone, and caused bil­lions of dol­lars in eco­nomic losses, ac­cord­ing to the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>An AFP pho­tog­ra­pher trav­elled through cen­tral Jiangxi, float­ing past partly sub­merged vil­lages and towns as res­cue work­ers bat­tled to re­pair lev­ees and dykes, and fore­cast­ers warned of yet more rain.</p>
    <p>The gi­ant Three Gorges reser­voir, which has been hold­ing back more wa­ter to try to ease down­stream flood risks, is more than 10m higher than its warn­ing level, with in­flows now at more than 50,000 cubic me­tres a sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Wa­ters in more than 400 rivers have ex­ceeded warn­ing lev­els, while some reached his­toric highs over a pe­riod that of­fi­cials say has caused the high­est av­er­age rain­fall lev­els across the Yangtze basin since 1961.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are par­tic­u­larly con­cerned about Poyang Lake – China’s largest fresh­wa­ter lake – in hard-hit Jiangxi prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The lake – formed from the over­spill of the Yangtze – is 2.5m higher than its warn­ing level.</p>
    <p>It has ex­panded by more than 2,000 sq km dur­ing this flood sea­son, and parts of the sur­round­ing town have been in­un­dated.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther east, Lake Tai near Shang­hai has also de­clared a red alert af­ter its wa­ter level rose to nearly a me­tre higher than its safe level.</p>
    <p>Sum­mer rains and sea­sonal glacial melt in the river’s Ti­betan plateau head­wa­ters cause rou­tine an­nual flood­ing.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics said the sum­mer flood­ing threat has wors­ened over the decades due in part to ram­pant overde­vel­op­ment and poor wa­ter con­ser­vancy poli­cies such as over­build­ing of ill-ad­vised dams and lev­ees.</p>
    <p>The Yangtze river basin is fore­cast to see a new round of heavy rain­fall in the com­ing days, ac­cord­ing to ex­perts from the Yangtze Wa­ter Re­sources Com­mis­sion of the Min­istry of Wa­ter Re­sources.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment had also is­sued a warn­ing for the Huaihe river, an­other ma­jor Chi­nese wa­ter­way to the north of the Yangtze, as its wa­ters con­tinue to rise.</p>
