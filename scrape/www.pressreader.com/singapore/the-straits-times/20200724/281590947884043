    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize will go ahead this year de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, but with its 12 top prizes cut from $10,000 to $3,000 each.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize (SLP) will go ahead this year de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, but with its 12 top prizes cut from $10,000 to $3,000 each.</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial award’s or­gan­iser, the Sin­ga­pore Book Coun­cil, said this was be­cause of the tough eco­nomic cli­mate, which has caused fund­ing to fall.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Wil­liam Phuan said re­duc­ing the prizes was a dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to make, but that the al­ter­na­tive would have been to can­cel the event al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>“We felt it was still im­por­tant to con­tinue to cel­e­brate the writ­ers and their achieve­ments,” he said af­ter the re­lease of the 47-strong short­list across 12 cat­e­gories – fic­tion, cre­ative non-fic­tion and po­etry in Chi­nese, English, Malay and Tamil – on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“We would like to ap­peal to the com­mu­nity to keep sup­port­ing Singlit in any way they are able to,” he added.</p>
    <p>“In these chal­leng­ing times, all are af­fected, but books are es­sen­tial.”</p>
    <p>The coun­cil’s pro­grammes are sup­ported by a ma­jor com­pany grant from the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil and the prize it­self re­ceives funds from var­i­ous foun­da­tions and pri­vate and cor­po­rate donors.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s old­est on­go­ing lit­er­ary prize in all four of­fi­cial lan­guages will go vir­tual for the first time on Aug 27 at 8pm, livestream­ed from the coun­cil’s Face­book and YouTube pages.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic may vote on­line for their favourite ti­tles in the in­au­gu­ral Read­ers’ Favourite cat­e­gory, with the win­ning writ­ers re­ceiv­ing $1,000 in cash.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers stand a chance to win book vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>In a re­flec­tion of the rise in Sin­ga­porean nov­el­ists mak­ing their pres­ence felt abroad, half the nom­i­na­tions for English fic­tion are nov­els pub­lished over­seas, in­clud­ing for­mer SLP win­ner Amanda Lee Koe’s De­layed Rays Of A Star and JingJing Lee’s How We Dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>They face off against lo­cally pub­lished works such as Lion City by Ng Yi-Sheng, who pre­vi­ously won for English po­etry, and Epi­gram Books Fic­tion Prize run­ner-up Nimita’s Place by Ak­shita Nanda.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal pub­lish­ers Ethos Books and Ung­gun Cre­ative tied for the high­est num­ber of ti­tles short­listed, with five nom­i­na­tions each.</p>
    <p>Ethos has This Is What In­equal­ity Looks Like, so­ci­ol­o­gist Teo You Yenn’s best-sell­ing non-fic­tion book about poverty, in the run­ning for English cre­ative non-fic­tion.</p>
    <p>It also dom­i­nates the English po­etry cat­e­gory with four out of five ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Ed­win Thum­boo’s A Gath­er­ing Of Themes and two-time SLP win­ner Yong Shu Hoong’s Right Of The Soil are up against edgy de­buts Gaze Back by Mary­lyn Tan and parse­treefor­est­fire by Hamid Roslan.</p>
    <p>Tan, 27, said: “As the only queer woman on the (English po­etry) short­list, I’m ut­terly pum­melled with vin­di­ca­tion with this show of es­tab­lish­ment recog­ni­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ung­gun Cre­ative co-founder Far­i­han Bahron said the young pub­lish­ing out­fit, which be­gan in 2016, was “hon­oured and hum­bled” to score so many nom­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Five au­thors were short­listed twice this year, in­clud­ing two of Ung­gun’s Malay-lan­guage writ­ers, Su­rat­man Markasan and J amal Is­mail, Tamil-lan­guage writ­ers A. K. Varad­hara­jan and Sithu­raj Pon­raj and Chi­nese-lan­guage writer Wong Koi Tet.</p>
    <p>Ja­mal, 68, has a dou­ble nom­i­na­tion in the Malay fic­tion cat­e­gory for his mag­i­cal re­al­ist col­lec­tion GOD(A) and Tun­juk Lan­git, a novel about the se­nior cit­i­zens of a soonto-be-de­mol­ished wel­fare home.</p>
    <p>He said he was a bit dis­ap­pointed by the cuts to the prize, but sug­gested that the win­ners be com­pen­sated in an­other form: trans­la­tion of their works. “Then ev­ery­one can ap­pre­ci­ate the kind of work we have in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Wong, 47, be­gan writ­ing the prose pieces of dakota, about Dakota Cres­cent where he grew up in the 1970s, in 2000, while the ear­li­est story in his fic­tion col­lec­tion Black Pan­ther dates back to 2003.</p>
    <p>Sithu­raj, who won for Tamil fic­tion in 2016, said he was thrilled to get nods for both his 80-poem col­lec­tion It Is Easy To Be An Ital­ian and novel The Wooden Ele­phant.</p>
    <p>“Frankly, very few Sin­ga­pore writ­ers I know write for the money,” he said. “I think the prize means some­thing by it­self.”</p>
    <p>The prize be­gan in 1992. This year, it at­tracted 224 sub­mis­sions, a 30 per cent in­crease from 2018.</p>
    <p>Each prize cat­e­gory is judged by a sep­a­rate panel of three writ­ers and in­dus­try ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Chief judges in­clude Es­planade com­mu­ni­ca­tions and con­tent head Clarissa Oon for English cre­ative non-fic­tion, Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent KTM Iqbal for Tamil po­etry and Dr Sa’eda Buang of the Asian Lan­guages and Cul­tures Aca­demic Group for Malay fic­tion.</p>
    <p>The award is open to any work in the three gen­res by a Sin­ga­porean cit­i­zen or per­ma­nent res­i­dent in the four lan­guages, which must be pub­lished in Sin­ga­pore or abroad in a phys­i­cal book for­mat be­tween Jan 1, 2018 and Dec 31 last year.</p>
