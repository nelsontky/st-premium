    <p>BU­DAPEST • Ser­gio Perez re­vealed yes­ter­day that teams in and out­side the For­mula One pad­dock had con­tacted him amid in­creas­ing spec­u­la­tion he could be re­placed at Racing Point next year by four-time world cham­pion Se­bas­tian Vet­tel.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man is leav­ing Fer­rari at the end of the sea­son and ac­cord­ing to Au­tosport, he is in ne­go­ti­a­tions to drive for Racing Point, which will be re­branded as As­ton Martin next year. Ger­man news­pa­per Bild has also in­di­cated an agree­ment is close to be­ing reached.</p>
    <p>A move for Vet­tel would mean Racing will have to drop ei­ther Cana­dian Lance Stroll or Perez.</p>
    <p>But as Stroll’s bil­lion­aire fa­ther, Lawrence, owns the team, the Mex­i­can is far more likely to make way should the move oc­cur.</p>
    <p>Perez, how­ever, yes­ter­day sought to shoot down the ru­mours, point­ing out he just signed a three­year con­tract last sea­son.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old said ahead of to­day’s prac­tice ses­sion for the Hun­gar­ian Grand Prix: “I know I’ve got a con­tract. Dur­ing the week, ob­vi­ously, the ru­mours came out and we ac­tu­ally got con­tacted by a team in the pad­dock. I won’t say names.</p>
    <p>“Also other teams in other cat­e­gories, which was quite a sur­prise be­cause we have a con­tract for the next (three) years here.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment, these are just ru­mours around. Noth­ing more to add from my side, other than we got a con­tract in place.”</p>
    <p>But de­spite the Mex­i­can’s in­sis­tence that his po­si­tion at Racing is se­cure, Au­tosport re­ported he has a break clause in his con­tract that would al­low the team to drop him for next year, al­though it must be ac­ti­vated by July 31.</p>
    <p>Red Bull boss Chris­tian Horner be­lieves Vet­tel’s next des­ti­na­tion is likely to be Racing Point, telling Sky Sports that “I don’t think Lance is go­ing to get fired”.</p>
    <p>While Perez’s po­si­tion looks in­creas­ingly shaky, his team­mate Stroll has never looked more se­cure, telling re­porters he was pay­ing no heed to “silly sea­son ru­mours”.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Lewis Hamil­ton, who last week­end called out Fer­rari for their si­lence on F1’s anti-racism ini­tia­tives, said he had been speak­ing to his fel­low driv­ers in a bid to get more of them to “take a knee”.</p>
    <p>The ges­ture, first started by for­mer San Fran­cisco 49ers quar­ter­back Colin Kaeper­nick to protest po­lice bru­tal­ity and racial in­jus­tice in the United States, has taken on a new life fol­low­ing the May 25 killing of black Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd by a white po­lice­man in Minneapoli­s.</p>
    <p>Mercedes’ Hamil­ton has been one of the most vo­cal pro­po­nents of the move­ment, tak­ing a knee both at the sea­son-open­ing Aus­trian GP and last Sun­day’s Steier­mark race.</p>
    <p>The six-time world cham­pion is aim­ing to rope in more driv­ers to sup­port the cause, say­ing: “We’re go­ing to come closer dur­ing this pe­riod of time, not say­ing that ev­ery­one is go­ing to be tak­ing a knee, but over time, we be­gin to talk about this more of­ten.</p>
    <p>“I like to think that at some stage, we’ll all be to­gether, un­der­stand­ing, tak­ing a knee.”</p>
