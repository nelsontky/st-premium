    <p>Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) will con­tinue to in­vest in trans­form­ing the me­dia business to keep up with chang­ing con­sumer habits, es­pe­cially with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic’s im­pact on the business.</p>
    <p>Its prop­erty seg­ment, in­clud­ing pur­pose-built stu­dent ac­com­mo­da­tion (PBSA) and re­tail, was also iden­ti­fied as an area for grow­ing re­cur­ring in­come, said SPH chief ex­ec­u­tive Ng Yat Chung at the com­pany’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He told a vir­tual au­di­ence: “SPH is fac­ing a chal­leng­ing me­dia land­scape. We have not been spared from rapid changes dis­rupt­ing the news me­dia in­dus­try ev­ery­where. Con­sumer habits are chang­ing, and they are increasing­ly mov­ing to dig­i­tal me­dia.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, our me­dia business faced a steady de­cline in both print ad­ver­tis­ing and print sub­scrip­tion rev­enue. And these are tra­di­tion­ally our largest rev­enue and profit driv­ers. The Covid-19 pan­demic this year has fur­ther ex­ac­er­bated these chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>SPH had ear­lier re­ported its first net loss of $83.7 mil­lion, for the year that ended on Aug 31.</p>
    <p>One of the strate­gies, mov­ing for­ward, is to grow in­come from its prop­erty seg­ment, Mr Ng said.</p>
    <p>He said in re­sponse to share­holder ques­tions that about 60 per cent of units at The Woodleigh Res­i­dences, a devel­op­ment by SPH and Ka­jima Devel­op­ment, have been sold as at Nov 20.</p>
    <p>SPH is also on track to be­come a size­able PBSA owner-op­er­a­tor, he said, with 7,723 beds across 28 as­sets in Bri­tain and Ger­many worth more than $1.4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“Many share­hold­ers have asked about the SPH plan to list our PBSA as­sets. We are al­ways con­sid­er­ing and look­ing out for op­por­tu­ni­ties to im­prove share­holder value,” said Mr Ng. “The list­ing of our PBSA is a pos­si­bil­ity. But an an­nounce­ment will be is­sued by the com­pany only in the event there is a ma­te­rial devel­op­ment on the mat­ter.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said SPH also aims to im­prove its fi­nan­cial per­for­mance, div­i­dend pay­out and share price.</p>
    <p>On Nov 20, the com­pany’s share price shot up about 19 per cent to $1.25, prompt­ing a query from the Sin­ga­pore bourse.</p>
    <p>SPH had replied then that it reg­u­larly eval­u­ates op­por­tu­ni­ties across its port­fo­lio. This may from time to time in­volve dis­cus­sions with var­i­ous par­ties and stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>It added that there is no as­sur­ance that any trans­ac­tion will ma­te­ri­alise or that any de­fin­i­tive or bind­ing agree­ment will be reached. It will make fur­ther an­nounce­ments as ap­pro­pri­ate, in com­pli­ance with list­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said SPH will in­vest in tech­no­log­i­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties to re­ju­ve­nate, rein­vent and re­po­si­tion its prod­uct of­fer­ings as it con­tin­ues its me­dia trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal cir­cu­la­tion and dig­i­tal ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enue have grown over the past few years, even as SPH con­tin­ues to try to stem the de­cline in print.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also im­proved its data an­a­lyt­ics, such as by build­ing a model to iden­tify and serve up pro­mo­tions to read­ers who are most likely to sub­scribe, lead­ing to a con­ver­sion rate that is three times higher than be­fore.</p>
    <p>It also made progress in es­ti­mat­ing ex­pected rev­enue from each sub­scriber, which will guide the devel­op­ment of new prod­ucts and op­ti­mise cus­tomer ac­qui­si­tion costs.</p>
    <p>Video an­a­lyt­ics, such as track­ing al­go­rithms, also help ex­am­ine traf­fic in front of out­door ad­ver­tis­ing screens so cam­paigns can be bet­ter de­signed for ad­ver­tiser re­turns.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said other trans­for­ma­tion ini­tia­tives in­clude The Straits Times’ re­vamp to make it a bet­ter ex­pe­ri­ence for read­ers. The next devel­op­ment will be to de­liver news tablets for the mag­a­zines as well.</p>
    <p>Chair­man Lee Boon Yang said: “SPH is pre­pared for a lengthy re­cov­ery from Covid-19. The pri­or­ity is to con­serve cash through an ef­fec­tive cost-con­trol pro­gramme while adopt­ing a dis­ci­plined and pru­dent ap­proach to cap­i­tal al­lo­ca­tion. Our re­silient bal­ance sheet will help the group buf­fer against the long-term un­cer­tainty.”</p>
