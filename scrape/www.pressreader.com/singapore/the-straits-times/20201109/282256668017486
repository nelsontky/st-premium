    <p>The Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) is com­mit­ted to pro­mot­ing a regime that seeks to main­tain a bal­ance be­tween com­pet­ing in­ter­ests, with­out favour­ing ei­ther debtors or cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>A spokesman, re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times last week, said Sin­ga­pore has a mod­ern and pro­gres­sive regime that in­cor­po­rates the best fea­tures of the world’s lead­ing ju­ris­dic­tions, al­ly­ing new pow­er­ful tools with the in­her­ent flex­i­bil­ity of the pre­vi­ous regime.</p>
    <p>“It is de­signed to fa­cil­i­tate suc­cess­ful re­struc­tur­ing, where pos­si­ble, by pro­vid­ing a plat­form for par­ties to ne­go­ti­ate in good faith, while pro­tect­ing cred­i­tors’ rights,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The Min­istry of Law con­tin­ues to mon­i­tor the im­pact that these re­forms have on cor­po­rate re­struc­tur­ings,” she added.</p>
    <p>MinLaw noted that the un­prece­dented im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic has led the Govern­ment to in­tro­duce a range of mea­sures to al­low em­ploy­ees, busi­nesses and the econ­omy to tide through this ex­cep­tional pe­riod.</p>
    <p>These in­clude tem­po­rary wage sub­si­dies to pro­tect jobs, a rental re­lief frame­work and a le­gal frame­work for tem­po­rary re­lief from le­gal ac­tion due to the in­abil­ity to per­form cer­tain con­tracts aris­ing from the pan­demic, among many other ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>“The Min­istry of Law will be in­tro­duc­ing a Re-Align Frame­work to help busi­nesses that have been sig­nif­i­cantly im­pacted by Covid-19 to rene­go­ti­ate se­lected types of con­tracts with their counter-par­ties to re­align with cur­rent eco­nomic con­di­tions and busi­ness ob­jec­tives,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the frame­work in Par­lia­ment last week, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong said the re­lief mea­sures in the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act passed in April</p>
    <p>can­not be con­tin­ued in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>“We will risk sus­tain­ing busi­nesses that are no longer vi­able. It would trap and lock away pre­cious eco­nomic ca­pac­i­ties such as work­ers, or prop­erty and as­sets, and this, in the longer term, would be dam­ag­ing for our econ­omy,” he said.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther moves for a tem­po­rary sim­pli­fied in­sol­vency pro­gramme to help mi­cro and small com­pa­nies have been pro­posed.</p>
    <p>Passed by Par­lia­ment last week, the pro­gramme will pro­vide such com­pa­nies, where ap­pro­pri­ate, an op­por­tu­nity to re­struc­ture their debts and put them­selves on a sus­tain­able fi­nan­cial foot­ing.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said: “Where the busi­ness is no longer vi­able, the pro­gramme will pro­vide a sim­pli­fied wind­ing-up process. This pro­gramme aims to max­imise re­turns to cred­i­tors and pre­vent in­di­vid­u­als be­hind the com­pa­nies from be­ing fi­nan­cially dam­aged in the long run.”</p>
