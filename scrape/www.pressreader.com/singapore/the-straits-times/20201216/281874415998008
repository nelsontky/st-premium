    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON The top US pri­vacy reg­u­la­tor or­dered some of the big­gest tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Ama­zon, Face­book and Google’s YouTube, to hand over in­for­ma­tion about how they col­lect and use data from users.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Trade Com­mis­sion (FTC) said on Mon­day that it is is­su­ing sweep­ing de­mands for in­for­ma­tion to the com­pa­nies, say­ing their use of con­sumer data is “shrouded in se­crecy”.</p>
    <p>The move in­ten­si­fies the US govern­ment’s scru­tiny of the tech in­dus­try’s busi­ness prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The FTC last week sued Face­book for al­leged vi­o­la­tions of an­titrust laws, a case that came on the heels of a Jus­tice De­part­ment com­plaint against Google. The FTC is also re­view­ing past ac­qui­si­tions of start-ups by tech giants.</p>
    <p>“Pol­i­cy­mak­ers and the pub­lic are in the dark about what so­cial me­dia and video stream­ing ser­vices do to cap­ture and sell users’ data and at­ten­tion,” said three FTC com­mis­sion­ers in a state­ment. “It is alarm­ing that we still know so lit­tle about com­pa­nies that know so much about us.”</p>
    <p>The agency is also ask­ing about the com­pa­nies’ ad­ver­tis­ing and user en­gage­ment prac­tices and how their prac­tices af­fect chil­dren and teenagers.</p>
    <p>The re­view will “lift the hood on the so­cial me­dia and video stream­ing firms to care­fully study their en­gines”, said the three com­mis­sion­ers – Democrats Re­becca Kelly Slaugh­ter and Ro­hit Cho­pra and Repub­li­can Chris­tine Wil­son.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can chair­man Joe Si­mons joined the three in vot­ing for the study, while GOP com­mis­sioner Noah Phillips voted against it, call­ing it “an undis­ci­plined foray into a wide va­ri­ety of top­ics”.</p>
    <p>Mr Cho­pra and Ms Wil­son had pre­vi­ously made calls for a sim­i­lar study. News web­site Ax­ios re­ported ear­lier on the study.</p>
    <p>The or­ders are also be­ing sent to ByteDance, which op­er­ates the pop­u­lar short-video ser­vice Tik­Tok, Dis­cord, Red­dit, Snap, Twit­ter and Face­book’s What­sApp. The com­pa­nies have 45 days from the date they re­ceive the or­der to re­spond.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon and Face­book de­clined to com­ment. YouTube, Tik­Tok and Snap did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>A Twit­ter spokesman said the com­pany is work­ing “to en­sure the FTC has the in­for­ma­tion it needs to un­der­stand how Twit­ter op­er­ates its ser­vices”.</p>
    <p>A Red­dit spokesman said it is “look­ing for­ward to work­ing with the FTC and shar­ing with them” its poli­cies and prac­tices.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Dis­cord noted that the so­cial plat­form pop­u­lar with gamers does not have ad­ver­tise­ments, and said the com­pany “takes user pri­vacy very se­ri­ously” and will work “with the FTC to an­swer their ques­tions”.</p>
    <p>The FTC is is­su­ing the or­ders un­der Sec­tion 6(b) of the FTC Act, which au­tho­rises it to con­duct wide-rang­ing stud­ies. They do not have to have a spe­cific law en­force­ment pur­pose, but the in­for­ma­tion can be used in fu­ture en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>The FTC has hit Face­book, YouTube and Mu­si­cal.ly, which is now Tik­Tok, with fines for pri­vacy lapses.</p>
    <p>Last year, Face­book agreed to pay a record US$5 bil­lion (S$6.7 bil­lion) to set­tle pri­vacy vi­o­la­tions stem­ming from the Cam­bridge An­a­lyt­ica scan­dal, in which a con­sult­ing firm hired by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign ob­tained data with­out users’ knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Some Demo­cratic law­mak­ers ap­plauded the move, as did chil­dren’s pri­vacy ad­vo­cates.</p>
    <p>“These 6(b) stud­ies will pro­vide a much-needed win­dow into the opaque data prac­tices that have a pro­found im­pact on young peo­ple’s well-be­ing,” said Mr Josh Golin, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Cam­paign for a Com­mer­cial-Free Child­hood, which has called for sim­i­lar probes.</p>
