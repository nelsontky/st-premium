    <p>Up to 45,000 peo­ple from low­in­come fam­i­lies can soon get a free hot meal at any time from a vend­ing ma­chine at a void deck in their neigh­bour­hood un­der a new com­mu­nity ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>The Food Bank has part­nered Philips Foun­da­tion to dis­trib­ute 45,000 “bank cards” that these peo­ple can use at the ma­chines, Philips said in a state­ment yes­ter­day. Philips Foun­da­tion is the char­i­ta­ble arm of the multi­na­tional tech con­glom­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Each card will have 50 monthly cred­its that can­not be rolled over if un­used. Each meal costs three cred­its and each dry food item, two cred­its.</p>
    <p>Philips Foun­da­tion has also spon­sored the in­stal­la­tion of one hot bento meal-dis­pens­ing and two dry food-dis­pens­ing vend­ing ma­chines at Block 131, Toa Payoh Lorong 1, which have been in use since Oct 27.</p>
    <p>The dry food ma­chine dis­penses do­nated food from sup­pli­ers and in­di­vid­u­als that might oth­er­wise have gone to waste, like ver­mi­celli, canned veg­eta­bles and meat, and pow­dered bev­er­age for­mu­las.</p>
    <p>The hot food ma­chine dis­penses nu­tri­tious meals en­dorsed by the Sin­ga­pore Heart Foun­da­tion, such as red rice ver­mi­celli with kung pao chicken and long beans, gin­ger fish with brown and white rice, and curry chicken with brown and white rice.</p>
    <p>The meals have been as­sessed by a cer­ti­fied nutri­tion­ist and con­tain less than 500 calo­ries each.</p>
    <p>These vend­ing ma­chines are un­der an ed­u­ca­tional ini­tia­tive by Philips and The Food Bank called “Pow­er­ing bet­ter liv­ing through ac­cess to nu­tri­tion”, which aims to bring nu­tri­tious meals and in­crease outreach on nu­tri­tion ed­u­ca­tion to low-in­come house­holds.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme, there are plans to out­fit a Food Bank show kitchen with Philips ap­pli­ances to ed­u­cate ben­e­fi­cia­ries on cre­at­ing sim­ple, con­ve­nient and nu­tri­tious meals at home, as well as hold work­shops on nu­tri­tious food prepa­ra­tion, in part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­pore Heart Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>While only one set of ma­chines is cur­rently in use, The Food Bank plans to ex­pand this is­land­wide in the next three months by get­ting other or­gan­i­sa­tions on board to spon­sor the ma­chines.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Chua, Par­li­men­tary Sec­re­tary for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, said food sup­port or­gan­i­sa­tions play an im­por­tant role in help­ing low-in­come and vul­ner­a­ble fam­i­lies stretch their dol­lar.</p>
    <p>“I am pleased to hear about this in­no­va­tive ini­tia­tive by Food Bank Sin­ga­pore and Philips Foun­da­tion to both pro­vide health­ier meals, and em­power ben­e­fi­cia­ries to pre­pare nu­tri­tious meals and build healthy eat­ing habits,” he said.</p>
    <p>Philips Sin­ga­pore coun­try man­ager Ivy Lai said: “Lever­ag­ing Philips’ ex­per­tise in health and</p>
    <p>well­ness, this pro­gramme aims to im­prove health eq­uity by phys­i­cally in­creas­ing ac­cess to nu­tri­tious meals and the ex­e­cu­tion of</p>
    <p>an ed­u­ca­tional outreach pro­gramme for ben­e­fi­cia­ries and the wider public.”</p>
    <p>Food Bank co-founder and chief food of­fi­cer Ni­chol Ng said that with the re­cent rise in “food in­se­cure” house­holds in Sin­ga­pore, there is a press­ing need to pro­vide con­tact­less, safe and nu­tri­tious hot food op­tions for many who do not have ready ac­cess to them.</p>
    <p>“When de­vel­op­ing these meals with the Sin­ga­pore Heart Foun­da­tion, we took into con­sid­er­a­tion fac­tors that would sup­port sus­tain­able habits for long-term health, like nu­tri­tional con­tent, ac­ces­si­bil­ity of in­gre­di­ents, the pop­u­la­tion’s taste pref­er­ences and con­ve­nience of con­sump­tion,” she added.</p>
