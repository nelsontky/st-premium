    </section>

    <p>Dig­i­tal mar­keter Lyn Yan took a flu shot in June amid the pan­demic when she re­alised there were sim­i­lar symp­toms for the coro­n­avirus and in­fluenza.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old said: “It may be dif­fi­cult to tell the dif­fer­ence be­tween the two based on symp­toms. I wanted to take care of my­self bet­ter dur­ing this pe­riod and as the flu vac­cine is avail­able, I felt I should take it.”</p>
    <p>Adopt­ing such proac­tive mea­sures to stay healthy can help peo­ple take bet­ter charge of their health while the search for a Covid-19 vac­cine con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>This means get­ting vac­ci­nated against pre­ventable diseases, such as in­fluenza and pneu­mo­nia, said doc­tors.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the manda­tory child­hood vac­cines for measles and diph­the­ria, which have a high take-up rate of over 95 per cent for the past 10 years in Singapore, the rates for other vac­cines do not have the same suc­cess, said Dr Leong Choon Kit, a fam­ily physi­cian at Mis­sion Med­i­cal Clinic in Seran­goon.</p>
    <p>“In gen­eral, most non-man­dated vac­cines see only a 10 to 15 per cent take-up rate. This is far from ideal,” he said.</p>
    <p>The vac­ci­na­tion cov­er­age for some of the rec­om­mended adult vac­cines has been es­ti­mated to be low – 14 per cent for in­fluenza vac­ci­na­tion and 12 per cent for pneu­mo­coc­cal vac­ci­na­tion for those aged be­tween 65 and 74 years old, ac­cord­ing to the pi­lot Na­tional Pop­u­la­tion Sur­vey 2016-2017.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health in­tro­duced the Na­tional Adult Im­mu­ni­sa­tion Sched­ule (Nais) in 2017 to en­cour­age adults to take up im­por­tant vac­ci­na­tions. It pro­vides im­mu­ni­sa­tion rec­om­men­da­tions to help peo­ple make an in­formed de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>There are seven listed vac­cines for in­fec­tions such as in­fluenza, pneu­mo­coc­cal and the hu­man pa­pil­lo­mavirus (HPV) in the sched­ule.</p>
    <p>From Nov 1, eli­gi­ble Sin­ga­porean chil­dren un­der the age of 18 will re­ceive free vac­ci­na­tions for diseases like in­fluenza and chick­en­pox as part of en­hanced sub­si­dies for na­tion­ally rec­om­mended vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean adults can ben­e­fit from higher sub­si­dies of be­tween $35 and $125 for na­tion­ally rec­om­mended vac­cines on the list.</p>
    <p>These vac­cines are un­der the Na­tional Child­hood Im­mu­ni­sa­tion Sched­ule (NCIS) and Nais, which are ad­min­is­tered at all Com­mu­nity Health As­sist Scheme (Chas) gen­eral prac­ti­tioner (GP) clin­ics and poly­clin­ics.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an in­fec­tious diseases ex­pert with Rophi Clinic at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal, said there may be a few rea­sons for the poor up­take of im­mu­ni­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“Many Sin­ga­pore­ans have a su­per­man or su­per­woman men­tal­ity. They think it (the dis­ease) won’t hap­pen to them. I had one pa­tient who was sched­uled to come for shin­gles vac­ci­na­tion in March, but she didn’t. She came back in April to see me for se­vere pain from shin­gles, when it could have been pre­vented.”</p>
    <p>The fear of nee­dles as well as wor­ries about the side ef­fects and ef­fec­tive­ness of vac­cines tend to put peo­ple off, he said.</p>
    <p>There are also peo­ple who refuse to be im­mu­nised against diseases, com­monly known as anti-vaxxers.</p>
    <p>Among rea­sons such as a lack of con­fi­dence in vac­cines, they also do not trust phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies, which they be­lieve to be mo­ti­vated by profit.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are many ben­e­fits to tak­ing up vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
    <p>A per­son is less likely to get the par­tic­u­lar dis­ease af­ter be­ing vac­ci­nated, said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, al­though not all vac­cines work 100 per cent. “There are some fail­ures. Dif­fer­ent peo­ple re­spond dif­fer­ently to the same an­tibi­otics.”</p>
    <p>Achiev­ing herd i mmu­nity is an­other rea­son doc­tors en­cour­age vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>This form of im­mu­nity oc­curs when vac­ci­na­tion of a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion pro­vides pro­tec­tion for those who have not de­vel­oped im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Choon Kit said: “We do that for diseases like in­fluenza, chick­en­pox and dengue. This is to re­duce the num­ber of vi­able hosts a virus can find in a com­mu­nity so that an epi­demic can be pre­vented and the vul­ner­a­ble can be pro­tected. The up­com­ing Covid-19 vac­cine will likely serve that func­tion too.”</p>
    <p>Some vac­cine-pre­ventable diseases can cause can­cer. For ex­am­ple, HPV and Hepati­tis B viruses can be trans­mit­ted be­tween adults who are not vac­ci­nated and are the most com­mon causes of cer­vi­cal and liver can­cer in the world.</p>
    <p>“So, in a way, get­ting vac­ci­nated pre­vents can­cer. The Hepati­tis B vac­cine pre­vents liver can­cer and the HPV vac­cine pre­vents cer­vi­cal can­cer,” said Dr Leong Choon Kit.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine-pre­ventable diseases can put pres­sure on health­care sys­tems.</p>
    <p>He adds: “We are see­ing this dur­ing the cur­rent pan­demic, in which Singapore is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a Covid-19 out­break and a se­vere dengue out­break at the same time. All our health­care fa­cil­i­ties in­clud­ing pri­mary care and hos­pi­tals could be swamped with sus­pected dengue cases and pa­tients with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions.”</p>
    <p>He noted that con­fu­sion may arise in the di­ag­no­sis and man­age­ment of the diseases in such times.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, both dengue and Covid-19 present with fever at the be­gin­ning of the in­fec­tion. So all pa­tients will need to be swabbed and ad­di­tional tests have to be con­ducted for both groups of pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) out­break in 2003, there was con­fu­sion be­tween Sars and in­fluenza. If the pub­lic is well vac­ci­nated against in­fluenza, the noise to di­ag­no­sis will be less.”</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Choon Kit high­lighted the in­creased im­por­tance of tak­ing an in­fluenza shot dur­ing this pan­demic. “The risk of an in­fluenza out­break is al­ways present. The vul­ner­a­ble may not be able to sur­vive two si­mul­ta­ne­ous in­fec­tions. Hence, im­mu­nis­ing against in­fluenza is more im­por­tant now than be­fore Covid-19 started,” he said.</p>
    <p>The mo­ti­va­tion to be vac­ci­nated comes from the in­di­vid­ual, he added. “Fre­quently, when they have suf­fered or when they have seen their loved ones suf­fer, they would be more con­vinced to be vac­ci­nated.”</p>
    <p>Agree­ing with this, Dr Leong Hoe Nam said: “The dis­ease needs to strike home. For ex­am­ple, when peo­ple see a friend or rel­a­tive get se­vere in­fluenza, they will vac­ci­nate against it. Oth­er­wise, hear­ing sto­ries of oth­ers whom they don’t know doesn’t put them on alert.”</p>
    <p>Both doc­tors re­mind their pa­tients of the im­por­tance of vac­ci­na­tions dur­ing con­sul­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>While Dr Leong Hoe Nam un­der­stands that peo­ple may fear get­ting Covid-19 if they visit a clinic for a vac­ci­na­tion dur­ing this time, he said it is an “un­founded worry”.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing to the clinic for a vac­ci­na­tion is the same as go­ing out for a meal. The mask re­mains on dur­ing the vac­ci­na­tion. This re­duces trans­mis­sion risk sig­nif­i­cantly.”</p>
    <p>The doc­tors ad­vised peo­ple to check on the avail­abil­ity of the vac­cines and make an ap­point­ment for vac­ci­na­tion in­stead of just head­ing to the GP clinic.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam sug­gested us­ing birthdays or sig­nif­i­cant oc­ca­sions as re­minders to stick to a sched­ule of get­ting vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>As it is im­por­tant for the pub­lic to be ed­u­cated on im­mu­ni­sa­tions, Dr Leong Choon Kit en­cour­aged peo­ple to get ac­cu­rate in­for­ma­tion from re­li­able sources such as health au­thor­ity web­sites in­stead of so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Get­ting vac­ci­nated goes be­yond pre­ven­tion and pro­tec­tion of the in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam said: “If we all work to­gether and achieve herd im­mu­nity, we can suc­cess­fully push back the in­fec­tion. The pop­u­la­tion will ben­e­fit. And from the pub­lic health per­spec­tive, this low­ers dis­ease oc­cur­rence and bur­den.”</p>
    <p>Many Sin­ga­pore­ans have a su­per­man or su­per­woman men­tal­ity. They think it (the dis­ease) won’t</p>
    <p>’’ hap­pen to them.</p>
    <p>DR LEONG HOE NAM, an in­fec­tious diseases ex­pert with Rophi Clinic at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal, on one of the rea­sons for the poor up­take of im­mu­ni­sa­tions The risk of an in­fluenza out­break is al­ways present.
