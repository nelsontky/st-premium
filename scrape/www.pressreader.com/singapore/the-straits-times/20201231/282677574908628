    <p>David At­ten­bor­ough nar­rates A Per­fect Planet, an epic doc­u­men­tary se­ries show­cas­ing the forces of na­ture that cre­ate and sup­port Earth’s great di­ver­sity of life.</p>
    <p>But it also il­lus­trates how del­i­cate that life-sus­tain­ing bal­ance is, es­pe­cially when it comes to the im­pact of the new­est force of na­ture on the planet: hu­man be­ings.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran broad­caster and nat­u­ral his­to­rian says it is more im­por­tant than ever to draw at­ten­tion to this.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery­body un­der­stands now, world­wide, that we are at a crit­i­cal point and that our planet is poised close to real big dis­as­ters.</p>
    <p>“We can stop them, but we’ve got to un­der­stand what they are and how they work, and that’s what this se­ries tells,” says the 94-year-old, who has writ­ten, pro­duced and nar­rated more than a hun­dred na­ture doc­u­men­taries and won Out­stand­ing Nar­ra­tor Em­mys for three, in­clud­ing Our Planet (2019) and Blue Planet II (2017).</p>
    <p>De­but­ing at noon on Jan 4 on BBC iPlayer and 8pm on Jan 11 on BBC Earth (Starhub TV Chan­nel 407), A Per­fect Planet – filmed in 31 coun­tries over three years – de­votes an episode each to five forces of na­ture that have shaped this pale blue dot: vol­ca­noes, the sun, the weather, the oceans and hu­mans.</p>
    <p>The first four chap­ters are a cel­e­bra­tion of na­ture and the stun­ning va­ri­ety of en­vi­ron­ments and crea­tures it has given rise to, but the tone of the fifth shifts dra­mat­i­cally as it takes i n the im­pact of the hu­man race.</p>
    <p>Even At­ten­bor­ough has a hard time wrap­ping his head around the rapid pro­gres­sion of the lat­ter, now the dom­i­nant force on the planet.</p>
    <p>“The first thing I keep re­mind­ing my­self of is that there are three times as many hu­man be­ings on this planet than when I first made a tele­vi­sion pro­gramme,” says the English­man, who has a ca­reer span­ning seven decades, start­ing with his join­ing Bri­tish broad­caster BBC in the 1950s.</p>
    <p>“This is not some­thing that hap­pened over eons of his­tory – it’s hap­pen­ing right now.”</p>
    <p>At the same event, ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer Alas­tair Fothergill and se­ries pro­ducer Huw Cordey say they wanted the fi­nal episode to strike a more hard-hit­ting note than the typ­i­cal nat­u­ral-his­tory pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The show could not be more timely, says Mr Fothergill.</p>
    <p>“You only have to look at the fires in Aus­tralia or Cal­i­for­nia, and the power of the hur­ri­canes that have been hit­ting the east coast of the United States, to ques­tion whether the planet has been up­set by hu­mans.”</p>
    <p>The se­ries will de­tail ex­actly how mankind is do­ing that, es­pe­cially when it comes to the pro­duc­tion of car­bon diox­ide, with hu­man ac­tiv­ity now re­spon­si­ble for a hun­dred times more of the green­house gas than all the vol­ca­noes on Earth.</p>
    <p>At­ten­bor­ough is joined in the last episode by a cli­mate sci­en­tist, a ma­rine bi­ol­o­gist and econ­o­mist to tell that story.</p>
    <p>But the show also strives to of­fer prac­ti­cal solutions and a glimmer of hope.</p>
    <p>“There are solutions and, with the po­lit­i­cal will, we can turn it around,” says Mr Fothergill.</p>
    <p>“Huw and I, and the whole team work­ing on that last episode, felt it was very im­por­tant that we showed some of the pos­i­tive things that can be done to min­imise the force that is hu­man­ity.”</p>
    <p>At­ten­bor­ough says that if noth­ing is done and “we don’t sort out how we deal with the planet, we’re in trou­ble”.</p>
    <p>But, he be­lieves, “we can sort it out, and it’s easy enough if we all be­have in cer­tain ways”.</p>
    <p>His call to ac­tion for view­ers on what they can do to coun­ter­act cli­mate change: “Re­duce the de­mands that each one of us makes on the planet – our de­mands in terms of how much food we eat, what we throw away and what we use for our power to make sure that we don’t pro­duce car­bon diox­ide.”</p>
    <p>“We should act with some re­straint in how we treat the world around us,” he adds. “If all of us do that, the prob­lems will be solved.”</p>
    <p>A Per­fect Planet is avail­able to watch at noon on Jan 4 on BBC iPlayer and 8pm on Jan 11 on BBC Earth (Starhub TV Chan­nel 407).</p>
