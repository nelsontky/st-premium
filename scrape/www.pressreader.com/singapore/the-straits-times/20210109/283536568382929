    <p>It may have seemed as though ev­ery­thing ground to a halt dur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker last year.</p>
    <p>But for front-lin­ers such as med­i­cal work­ers and re­searchers, things were hec­tic. Among these front-lin­ers was Dr Matthew Tay, an Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) re­search fel­low at the Sin­ga­pore Im­munol­ogy Net­work, who spe­cialises in an­ti­body discovery in in­fec­tious dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old re­calls: “We worked on a seven-day lab and seven-day home sched­ule. This meant that all ex­per­i­ments had to be crammed into half the avail­able time, and all data analysis into the other half. Some weeks ended up be­ing strings of 16-hour work days.”</p>
    <p>To Dr Tay, it was not just a race to meet tight dead­lines, but also a war against a global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We knew that the sooner we com­pleted our sci­en­tific stud­ies on the virus, the more use­ful it would be to public health agen­cies and front-line med­i­cal work­ers,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Since Fe­bru­ary last year, Dr Tay has been part of the A*Star Covid19 re­search task force, as­sist­ing teams that eval­u­ated Covid-19 di­ag­nos­tic kits for clin­i­cal de­ploy­ment na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>To­gether with a group of sci­en­tists, he also co-au­thored an ar­ti­cle that con­sol­i­dated early re­search on Covid-19. It was pub­lished in April last year in the Na­ture Re­views Im­munol­ogy journal and the time­li­ness of the ar­ti­cle led to its mas­sive pop­u­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>Writ­ten in the stars</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up, Dr Tay al­ways felt a strong call­ing to help oth­ers, es­pe­cially the less for­tu­nate. He de­cided to pur­sue sci­en­tific re­search as he be­lieved the field would en­able him to do work that could save or im­prove the qual­ity of many lives.</p>
    <p>“( The field of ) in­fec­tious dis­ease was a nat­u­ral fit for me, since in­fec­tious dis­eases have a dis­pro­por­tion­ately large im­pact on the poor. Yet, they re­main rel­a­tively un­der-re­searched,” he says.</p>
    <p>He ap­plied for and was awarded the A*Star Na­tional Sci­ence Schol­ar­ship (BS-PhD) to pur­sue his un­der­grad­u­ate stud­ies at Brown Univer­sity (2009 to 2012) and sub­se­quently, his PhD at Duke Univer­sity in the United States (2013 to 2018).</p>
    <p>Dr Tay was keen on A*Star as he feels the agency aligns with his goal of trans­lat­ing re­search re­sults into real-world out­comes, to make an im­pact on peo­ple’s lives. The schol­ar­ship also al­lowed him to get into a PhD lab that oth­er­wise would not have had the fund­ing to sup­port him.</p>
    <p>At the PhD lab, I was able to work with and learn from the best in the vac­cine field, which gave me skills and knowl­edge that are di­rectly rel­e­vant to our fight against Covid-19.</p>

    <p>The A*Star Grad­u­ate Academy pro­vides schol­ar­ships and fel­low­ships for un­der­grad­u­ate, PhD and post-doc­toral stud­ies at top uni­ver­si­ties and lab­o­ra­to­ries lo­cally and over­seas, as well as awards and at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for pre-univer­sity stu­dents.</p>
