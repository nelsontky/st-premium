    <p>PARIS • France was in mourn­ing yes­ter­day for its former pres­i­dent Valery Gis­card d’Es­taing, who died of Covid-19 at the age of 94.</p>
    <p>Trib­utes poured in, hail­ing him as an am­bi­tious so­cial re­former and great Euro­pean statesman.</p>
    <p>Mr Gis­card, who had been in hospi­tal sev­eral times in the past few months for heart prob­lems, died on Wed­nes­day at the fam­ily es­tate in the Loire re­gion. His fam­ily said in a state­ment that they were with him when he died.</p>
    <p>He ruled for a sin­gle seven-year term from 1974-1981, dur­ing which France made great strides in nu­clear power, high-speed train travel and le­galised abor­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Gis­card en­sured that Paris was at the heart of Europe in a post-war al­liance with Ger­many, and also played a key role in what would be­come the Group of Seven – a bloc of ma­jor world pow­ers.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said in a state­ment: “His seven-year man­date transforme­d France. The di­rec­tion he set for France still guides our way... his death has plunged the French na­tion into mourn­ing.”</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day he was sad­dened by the news of Mr Gis­card’s pass­ing. He added that the former pres­i­dent “played a huge role in the mod­erni­sa­tion of French so­ci­ety and was a pro­po­nent of Euro­pean in­te­gra­tion – lay­ing the ground­work for the euro sin­gle cur­rency”.</p>
    <p>“MM Lee Kuan Yew was also his guest on sev­eral oc­ca­sions when he vis­ited France,” PM Lee said.</p>
