    <p>WASH­ING­TON • In blis­ter­ing lan­guage de­nounc­ing Repub­li­can ef­forts to sub­vert the elec­tion, the at­tor­neys-gen­eral for Penn­syl­va­nia, Michi­gan, Wis­con­sin and Ge­or­gia on Thurs­day asked the Supreme Court to re­ject a law­suit that seeks to over­turn Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s vic­to­ries in those states, call­ing the ef­fort an af­front to democ­racy and the rule of law.</p>
    <p>The law­suit, filed by the Repub­li­can at­tor­ney-gen­eral of Texas and backed by his party col­leagues in 17 other states and 106 Repub­li­can mem­bers of Congress, rep­re­sents the most co­or­di­nated, politi­cised at­tempt to over­turn an elec­tion re­sult in re­cent Amer­i­can his­tory.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has asked to in­ter­vene in the law­suit as well, in the hope that the Supreme Court will hand him a sec­ond term he de­ci­sively lost.</p>
    <p>The suit is the lat­est le­gal ef­fort by Mr Trump and his al­lies to over­turn the re­sults, even though mul­ti­ple judges at all lev­els have la­belled the cases as be­ing with­out merit.</p>
    <p>Le­gal ex­perts have scoffed at the lat­est suit as well, which makes the claim that the Supreme Court should in­ves­ti­gate and over­ride the elec­tion sys­tems of four states at the be­hest of a fifth.</p>
    <p>The re­sponses by the four states com­pre­hen­sively cri­tiqued Texas’ un­usual request to have the Supreme Court act as a kind of trial court in ex­am­in­ing sup­posed elec­tion ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties with the goal of throw­ing out mil­lions of votes.</p>
    <p>“The court should not abide this sedi­tious abuse of the judicial process, and should send a clear and un­mis­tak­able sig­nal that such abuse must never be repli­cated,” a brief for Penn­syl­va­nia said.</p>
    <p>“Let us be clear,” the brief con­tin­ued. “Texas in­vites this court to over­throw the votes of the Amer­i­can peo­ple and choose the next pres­i­dent of the United States. That Faus­tian in­vi­ta­tion must be firmly re­jected.”</p>
    <p>The briefs said Texas was in no po­si­tion to tell other states how to run their elec­tions, adding that its fil­ing was lit­tered with false­hoods.</p>
    <p>“Texas pro­poses an ex­tra­or­di­nary in­tru­sion into Wis­con­sin’s and the other de­fen­dant states’ elec­tions, a task that the Con­sti­tu­tion leaves to each state,” Wis­con­sin’s brief said.</p>
    <p>“Wis­con­sin has con­ducted its elec­tion and its vot­ers have cho­sen a win­ning can­di­date for their state. Texas’ bid to nul­lify that choice is de­void of a le­gal foun­da­tion or a fac­tual ba­sis.”</p>
