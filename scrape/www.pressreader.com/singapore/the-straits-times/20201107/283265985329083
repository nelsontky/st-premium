    <p>LON­DON • His daugh­ters-in-law Kate Mid­dle­ton and Meghan Markle are reg­u­larly lauded for their fash­ion sense, but Bri­tain’s Prince Charles, who is well known for patch­ing up and mend­ing his clothes, has prob­a­bly been con­sid­ered a l ess likely Bri­tish style icon – un­til now.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways ad­mired the way you dress,” Mr Ed­ward En­nin­ful, edi­tor-in-chief of Bri­tish Vogue, told Prince Charles, 71, i n an in­ter­view for the fash­ion mag­a­zine’s lat­est edi­tion.</p>
    <p>The praise for his time­less dress sense seemed to take the heir to the throne, who usu­ally favours dou­ble-breasted suits ac­com­pa­nied with a tie and match­ing hand­ker­chief, by sur­prise.</p>
    <p>“I thought I was like a stopped clock... peo­ple come round af­ter 25 years to dress­ing like I do,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I’m very glad you think it has style. I mind about de­tail and colour and things like that.”</p>
    <p>The male mem­bers of Bri­tain’s royal fam­ily have usu­ally taken a back seat to the fe­males when it comes to fash­ion cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Mid­dle­ton, 38, wife of Prince Charles’ elder son Prince Wil­liam, has pre­vi­ously fea­tured on the cover of Vogue while Markle, 39, wife of Wil­liam’s younger brother Prince Harry, has guest-edited the mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>Prince Charles wore a suit he has owned since 1984 when he at­tended Prince Harry’s wed­ding to Markle in May 2018, as Mr En­nin­ful asked him if he had con­sid­ered wear­ing some­thing new that day.</p>
    <p>“I’ve con­sid­ered it,” the Prince said. “But in the case of that par­tic­u­lar morn­ing coat, as long as I can go on get­ting into it, I wear it only a few times a year, in the sum­mer, so ob­vi­ously you want to keep those sorts of things go­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added: “But if I can’t fit into them, then I just have to have some­thing new made. But I’m not sure quite how rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent they can be at my age.”</p>
    <p>Prince Charles, who has long cam­paigned on en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues, was in­ter­viewed for Vogue about his com­mit­ment to sus­tain­able fash­ion, some­thing he said he had al­ways taken to heart.</p>
    <p>“I’m one of those peo­ple who hate throw­ing any­thing away. Hence, I’d rather have them main­tained, even patched if nec­es­sary, than to aban­don them,” he said, call­ing on man­u­fac­tur­ers and con­sumers to be less waste­ful.</p>
    <p>“But it seems to me there are huge op­por­tu­ni­ties, par­tic­u­larly now, within the whole sus­tain­able fash­ion sec­tor, to counter this ex­tra­or­di­nary trend of throw­away cloth­ing – or throw­away ev­ery­thing – frankly,” he added.</p>
