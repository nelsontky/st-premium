    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese pros­e­cu­tors have charged a man with mur­der over the 2019 ar­son at­tack on Ky­oto An­i­ma­tion that killed 36 peo­ple, the coun­try’s dead­li­est vi­o­lent crime in decades.</p>
    <p>Shinji Aoba, 42, was de­tained in the af­ter­math of the July at­tack, but has been un­der con­stant med­i­cal su­per­vi­sion since then af­ter sus­tain­ing se­vere burns in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The charges in­clude mur­der, at­tempted mur­der, ar­son, tres­pass and breach of the arms-con­trol law, the Ky­oto pros­e­cu­tor’s of­fice said, with­out giv­ing fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>More than 30 peo­ple were also in­jured in the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Aoba is ac­cused of break­ing into the stu­dio’s build­ing, spread­ing petrol around the ground floor and set­ting it alight.</p>
    <p>Aoba has re­port­edly con­fessed to the ar­son, and is said to have shouted “drop dead” be­fore start­ing the fire.</p>
    <p>The charges an­nounced yes­ter­day were made af­ter a psy­chi­atric eval­u­a­tion, lo­cal me­dia said.</p>
    <p>There have been claims that</p>
    <p>Aoba ac­cused the stu­dio of steal­ing his work, which Ky­oto An­i­ma­tion has de­nied do­ing.</p>
    <p>Many of those killed in the blaze were young, in­clud­ing a 21-yearold woman.</p>
    <p>Par­ents of some of those killed said news of the charges did lit­tle to ease their pain.</p>
    <p>“My feel­ings don’t change,” Ms Chieko Take­moto, who lost her son Ya­suhiro, told NHK. “When I’m alone, I want to cry, rememberin­g him... I’m so sad he’s gone.”</p>
    <p>Ky­oto An­i­ma­tion, known by its fans as Ky­oAni, is well known both do­mes­ti­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally for its role in pro­duc­ing pop­u­lar TV anime se­ries in­clud­ing The Me­lan­choly Of Haruhi Suzu­miya.</p>
    <p>Aoba nearly died of the in­juries he sus­tained in the at­tack, a doc­tor who treated him told the Ky­oto Shim­bun news­pa­per re­cently.</p>
    <p>He re­quired 12 op­er­a­tions to ap­ply skin grafts, the doc­tor said, and the hospi­tal opted to use Aoba’s own skin rather than tap a graft bank to avoid short­ages of skin for his vic­tims.</p>
