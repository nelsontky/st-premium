    <p>NEW YORK • Celebrity power cou­ple Alex Ro­driguez and Jen­nifer Lopez have turned to some heavy hit­ters as­so­ci­ated with other sports to bol­ster their bid to pur­chase Ma­jor League Base­ball out­fit the New York Mets.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ESPN, Na­tional Foot­ball League (NFL) Hall of Fame line­backer Brian Ur­lacher, Su­per Bowl cham­pion Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs, for­mer NFL run­ning back DeMarco Mur­ray and for­mer NFL line­man Joe Thomas have joined their con­sor­tium.</p>
    <p>The quar­tet will link up with twotime All-Star Bradley Beal of the Wash­ing­ton Wizards and Den­ver Nuggets cen­tre Ma­son Plum­lee, with both Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion play­ers pre­vi­ously com­ing on board as in­vestors back­ing Ro­driguez and Lopez’s bid.</p>
    <p>Ur­lacher told ESPN the cou­ple’s star power lent cre­dence to the pos­si­ble takeover for an ini­tial US$1.7 bil­lion (S$2.37 bil­lion), with US$300 mil­lion com­ing from their own pock­ets.</p>
    <p>Lopez is one of the big­gest celebri­ties in the world, with the 50-year-old singer and movie star’s for­tune es­ti­mated at US$400 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Three-time Most Valu­able Player Ro­driguez (A-Rod) is best known for his nine-year spell with the New York Yan­kees, win­ning the World Se­ries in 2009, and the 44-year-old has a net worth of around US$350 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing a for­mer ath­lete and hav­ing a chance to be a part of a group try­ing to pur­chase a pro­fes­sional team, it’s pretty cool,” Chicago Bears great Ur­lacher said on Mon­day. “It’s es­pe­cially cool to be in­volved with Alex. Alex is the man. You’ve got Kelce, Joe, DeMarco Mur­ray. It’s great to be in a group with them.”</p>
    <p>On their new part­ners, Ro­driguez and fi­ancee Lopez told CBS Sports: “We couldn’t be more ex­cited to have such high-qual­ity in­di­vid­u­als as part of our group.”</p>
    <p>While their bid trails the US$2 bil­lion of­fer made by hedge fund bil­lion­aire Steve Co­hen, the New York Post has re­ported that the Wilpon fam­ily, who own the Mets, pre­fer to sell to the Ro­driguez-Lopez group if its of­fer is close to the best bid at main­ing pro­fes­sional teams with Na­tive Amer­i­can mas­cots and lo­gos to reeval­u­ate their names and monikers.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor League Base­ball (MLB) out­fit Cleve­land In­di­ans are al­ready in the process of re­view­ing their name, hav­ing re­moved their di­vi­sive Chief Wa­hoo logo over two years ago.</p>
    <p>The team said: “We are com­mit­ted to mak­ing a pos­i­tive im­pact in our com­mu­nity and em­brace our rethe end of the auc­tion.</p>
    <p>The Post added that Lopez and Ro­driguez want to turn Citi Field, the Mets’ ball park, into an en­ter­tain­ment venue and re­de­velop the sur­round­ing Wil­lets Point neigh­bour­hood, which is largely in­dus­trial.</p>
    <p>They also want to in­stall a box area for high-pro­file fans like co­me­di­ans Jerry Se­in­feld and Chris Rock spon­si­bil­ity to ad­vance so­cial jus­tice and equal­ity.</p>
    <p>“Our or­gan­i­sa­tion fully recog­nises our team name is among the most vis­i­ble ways in which we con­nect with the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low MLB out­fit At­lanta Braves will not be chang­ing their name af­ter talk­ing to Na­tive Amer­i­can in­ter­est groups, but it will be eval­u­at­ing the “tom­a­hawk chop” – a pop­u­lar ges­ture per­formed by their fans. and ac­tor Matthew Broderick, copy­ing the New York Knicks’ “celebrity row”.</p>
    <p>In April, Forbes placed the Mets’ value at US$2.4 bil­lion, a 4 per cent rise from last year, with the team con­sid­ered to be the sixth most valu­able team in the league. Their cross-town ri­vals, the Yan­kees, head the list on US$5 bil­lion.</p>
