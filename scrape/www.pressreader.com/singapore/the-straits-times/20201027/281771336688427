    <p>• Euro­pean lead­ers yes­ter­day warned of dif­fi­cult months ahead as the resur­gent Covid-19 pan­demic forced the au­thor­i­ties to im­pose new re­stric­tions to try to curb the spread of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The pic­ture was un­re­lent­ingly grim as a string of coun­tries re­ported record i ncreases, l ed by France, which posted more than 50,000 daily cases for the first time on Sun­day, while the rest of the con­ti­nent passed the thresh­old of 250,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>But Pro­fes­sor Jean-Fran­cois Del­fraissy, who heads the sci­en­tific coun­cil that ad­vises the French gov­ern­ment on the pan­demic, told RTL ra­dio yes­ter­day that the coun­try may be ex­pe­ri­enc­ing 100,000 new cases per day – twice the lat­est of­fi­cial fig­ure.</p>
    <p>“There are prob­a­bly more than 50,000 cases per day. We es­ti­mate, on the sci­en­tific com­mit­tee, that we are more i n the re­gion of 100,000 cases per day,” he said.</p>
    <p>France, the euro zone’s sec­ond­biggest econ­omy, is ex­am­in­ing whether to tighten lock­down mea­sures fur­ther to curb the resur­gence of the virus, hav­ing al­ready im­posed night-time cur­fews on ma­jor cities in­clud­ing Paris.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean gov­ern­ments have been des­per­ate to avoid the lock­downs which curbed the dis­ease at the start of the year at the cost of shut­ting down their en­tire economies.</p>
    <p>But the steady rise in new cases has forced them to ratchet up con­trols steadily.</p>
    <p>“We are fac­ing very, very dif­fi­cult months ahead,” Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel told a meet­ing of lead­ers from her Chris­tian Demo­crat party, ac­cord­ing to daily Bild.</p>
    <p>Al­though Ger­many has fared rel­a­tively well com­pared with other coun­tries in Europe, it too has seen a sharp rise in cases.</p>
    <p>It re­ported 8,685 new cases yes­ter­day, with the death toll ris­ing by 24 to 10,056 and an in­fec­tion rate of 74.9 per 100,000 peo­ple over the past seven days.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of a dis­trict in the Ger­man state of Bavaria will from to­day be banned from leav­ing their homes with­out a valid rea­son and schools and kinder­gartens will shut for two weeks.</p>
    <p>The l ock­down i n Rot­tal-Inn, home to some 120,000 peo­ple, will be the sec­ond im­posed in Ger­many on a lo­cal ba­sis since April.</p>
    <p>The first was in Ber­cht­es­gaden – 110km to the south in the Bavar­ian Alps – which has been in lock­down since Oct 20.</p>
    <p>In Bel­gium, an of­fi­cial warned yes­ter­day that the coun­try could run out of beds in in­ten­sive care units (ICUs) within two weeks if the num­ber of peo­ple in hos­pi­tals con­tin­ues to in­crease at its cur­rent rate.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium has Europe’s sec­ond­high­est in­fec­tion rate per capita af­ter the Czech Re­pub­lic, with new cases dou­bling ev­ery 13 days. The num­ber of pa­tients in ICUs is dou­bling ev­ery eight days, with 4,827 peo­ple in hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Health Min­istry spokesman Yves Van Laethem said Bel­gium’s max­i­mum ca­pac­ity of 2,000 ICU beds might be reached in two weeks if the in­crease con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>“Within four days, by the end of the week, we should pass the milestone of 1,000 pa­tients in in­ten­sive care,” Mr Van Laethem said.</p>
    <p>In Switzer­land, Health Min­is­ter Alain Ber­set said new re­stric­tions slated to be an­nounced to­mor­row to con­tain the rapid spread of Covid-19 will likely be in place for “a long time”, as new in­fec­tions hit 17,440 over the week­end.</p>
    <p>“What we’re pre­par­ing now will likely last a long time,” Mr Ber­set said at a news con­fer­ence in Lau­sanne. “We’re not mak­ing de­ci­sions on Wed­nes­day for Fri­day, we’re mak­ing de­ci­sions for the next weeks and months,” he said.</p>
