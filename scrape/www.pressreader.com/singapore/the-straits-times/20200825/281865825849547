    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Con­victed of cor­rup­tion less than a month ago and sen­tenced to 12 years in jail, for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak was back cam­paign­ing for a party can­di­date over the week­end in a by-elec­tion for a state as­sem­bly seat.</p>
    <p>Out on bail, he is wait­ing for his ap­peal date to be set, while stand­ing ac­cused in two other tri­als and wait­ing for two more to be­gin – mostly linked to the loot­ing of bil­lions of dol­lars from de­funct sov­er­eign fund 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB).</p>
    <p>De­spite that, his party – the United Malays Na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Umno) – and its eth­nic Chi­nese and In­dian party al­lies in­vited Na­jib to be their star cam­paigner for a by-elec­tion this month in Slim dis­trict, about 90 min­utes north of the cap­i­tal Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>Na­jib was voted out of of­fice in 2018 amid ou­trage over the 1MDB scan­dal. But since then, he has un­der­gone a pub­lic re­la­tions makeover to shed his im­age as a blue-blooded mem­ber of the elite and broaden his ap­peal to or­di­nary Malays. With more than four mil­lion fol­low­ers on Face­book and Twit­ter, he has be­come more pop­u­lar on so­cial me­dia than any other Malaysian politi­cian.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing al­ways de­nied guilt, Na­jib said the court ver­dict had not af­fected his voter ap­peal, or that of his party.</p>
    <p>“On the con­trary, some peo­ple say I have much more sym­pa­thy from the peo­ple,” he told Reuters dur­ing a cam­paign stop in Perak.</p>
    <p>His for­tunes ap­peared to im­prove in Fe­bru­ary as his ri­vals’ coali­tion govern­ment im­ploded and Umno re­turned to power in an al­liance led by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>On the stump in ru­ral Perak, Na­jib was very much in his com­fort zone, though the num­bers at­tend­ing elec­tion ral­lies were restricted by coro­n­avirus so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>As he ar­rived at a break­fast gath­er­ing, loud­speak­ers blasted out a thump­ing rap to de­liver his catch­phrase.</p>
    <p>Us­ing biker slang, the mes­sage goes: “What’s to be ashamed of, my boss?” Around a hun­dred sup­port­ers present cheered.</p>
    <p>Later in the day, Na­jib vis­ited homes in com­mu­ni­ties fringed by oil palm es­tates and posed for self­ies over lunch at a restaurant.</p>
    <p>Mr Shahrum Ab­dul Rakeb, a diner, told Reuters that Na­jib had his un­wa­ver­ing sup­port.</p>
    <p>“We will see how the sit­u­a­tion turns out, but ei­ther way, I still sup­port him. I think the peo­ple have be­gun to re­alise, we know who is bet­ter for us.”</p>
    <p>Mr Vang­dasalam Govin­dasamy, a 45-year-old voter, said: “We don’t know for sure whether he is re­ally guilty or not. As far as I am con­cerned, when he was in power, he did things for us. He helped us.”</p>
    <p>Some crit­ics said Na­jib’s camp has em­ployed cy­ber troop­ers to am­plify its so­cial me­dia pres­ence and paid peo­ple to show up at ral­lies.</p>
    <p>Na­jib, deny­ing such tac­tics, said: “The mo­men­tum that we cre­ated... is com­ing from the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Though he re­tains his seat in Par­lia­ment, where Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s al­liance holds a wafer-thin ma­jor­ity, Na­jib can­not con­test an elec­tion so long as the guilty ver­dict hangs over him.</p>
    <p>He did not elab­o­rate on his plans, but said his pri­or­ity was to be the “voice of the peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Few peo­ple would bet against him making a come­back if his ap­peal suc­ceeds or if he is granted a royal par­don.</p>
