    <p>If you look at her pro­file pho­to­graph on LinkedIn, it is al­most im­pos­si­ble to find any flaw with her looks – at­trac­tive with a bright smile and good com­plex­ion.</p>
    <p>Yet, be­neath that cheer­ful and con­fi­dent ap­pear­ance is a woman who was so ob­sessed with want­ing to look per­fect that she ended up al­most bank­rupt due to ex­ces­sive spend­ing on beauty-re­lated prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The wake-up call for t he 39-year-old free­lance writer came three years ago when she was threat­ened with a law­suit for ow­ing close to $60,000 to banks. And this was after her par­ents had stepped in three times to pay off more than $15,000 of her debts.</p>
    <p>The source of her prob­lem was adult acne, a con­di­tion com­mon with many peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But like specks of black paint on a white can­vas, Pauline (not her real name) could not stand the sight of such im­per­fec­tion when she looked at her­self in the mir­ror.</p>
    <p>This started when she was in her l ate 20s soon after she started work­ing.</p>
    <p>“My acne af­fected me greatly. It made me feel unattrac­tive about my­self,” she tells In­vest.</p>
    <p>As her in­come was de­pen­dent on the pro­ject she was work­ing on, her pay would vary from about $2,000 to $5,000 a month.</p>
    <p>But this did not stop her from pay­ing for ex­pen­sive fa­cial treat­ments, as well as spend­ing thou­sands of dol­lars to sign up for pack­ages with beauty and skin­care com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“I also bought skin­care prod­ucts in the mis­taken be­lief that a high price point in­di­cated qual­ity. So I would spend on ex­pen­sive make-up to cover up my acne.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to cos­metic prod­ucts, she also splurged on clothes, shoes and ac­ces­sories to make her­self look and feel good.</p>
    <p>“I was also shop­ping be­cause I felt lonely. Buy­ing some­thing nice gave me a rush – eu­pho­ria – that mo­men­tar­ily took away my lone­li­ness. Tak­ing th­ese two rea­sons to­gether, I did not care about spend­ing within my means,” she says.</p>
    <p>Pauline kept do­ing this for a few years with her credit cards – rolling over the debt and pay­ing what she could af­ford every month.</p>
    <p>Some time in 2015, she also dis­cov­ered that she could ap­ply for per­sonal loans from banks of­fer­ing in­ter­est rates that were about four or five times lower than credit cards’ 25 per cent. This em­bold­ened her to spend even more on credit – she even used the loans to help pay for her younger brother’s univer­sity fees, as well as to fund her over­seas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents knew that she had fi­nan­cial prob­lems and thus helped to set­tle some of her credit card bills. Still, this did not make her think of keep­ing her ex­penses in check.</p>
    <p>“I felt as­sured that as long as I had my job, I could slowly pay the debt off,” she says, not­ing that it was more im­por­tant that she looked bet­ter.</p>
    <p>But her self-in­duced beau­ti­ful dream soon turned into a night­mare when the banks threat­ened to sue her if she did not clear her debt.</p>
    <p>Left with no other choice, she turned to Credit Coun­selling Sin­ga­pore (CCS) for help.</p>
    <p>“I felt over­whelmed and help­less by the size that my debt had blown up to. The first thing CCS told me to do was to can­cel my credit cards and credit lines im­me­di­ately.”</p>
    <p>In 2017, she was put on a debt man­age­ment pro­gramme. And for close to four years now, she has been mak­ing fixed monthly pay­ments to dif­fer­ent banks. She still has up to the end of next year be­fore she fi­nally clears her debt.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that she is feel­ing much bet­ter today, she says her ex­pe­ri­ence has made her less crit­i­cal of her own looks.</p>
    <p>“My acne is still around, but I have learnt to live with it over the years. De­spite us­ing more af­ford­able skin­care prod­ucts, my con­di­tion has not wors­ened.</p>
    <p>“Nor do I use much make-up th­ese days. I also sel­dom go for fa­cials. I am still buy­ing clothes from mass-mar­ket brands, with a more ex­pen­sive item once in a while.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, from her time with CCS, she has learnt some shop­ping tips that she wants to share with peo­ple who have a ten­dency to over­spend.</p>
    <p>Buy only what you can af­ford. If you spend more on one item, then you have to cut the ex­penses for other items.</p>
    <p>Don’t j udge a prod­uct by its price. As she had spent more on beauty prod­ucts than most peo­ple, she found that some cheaper ones turned out to be bet­ter than more ex­pen­sive items.</p>
    <p>“There may be shoddy prod­ucts avail­able at low price points. But there are some de­cent ones as well. So do your own re­search and study the prod­uct to de­ter­mine the qual­ity,” she says.</p>
    <p>Think twice be­fore mak­ing a pur­chase. Very of­ten, peo­ple who rush into shop­ping tend to end up buy­ing things that they ei­ther don’t need or can’t af­ford.</p>
    <p>“Some­times a quick pause over a cup of cof­fee helps. Other times, you might need to sleep on a de­ci­sion. Also, don’t al­ways shop at the same stores. Most im­por­tantly, good sense, or good money sense, should still pre­vail.”</p>
    <p>OVER­WHELMED AND HELP­LESS I felt over­whelmed and help­less by the size that my debt had blown up to. The first thing CCS (Credit Coun­selling Sin­ga­pore) told me to do was to can­cel my credit cards and credit lines im­me­di­ately.</p>
