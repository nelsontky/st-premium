    <p>PRAGUE • Czech Prime Min­is­ter An­drej Babis has tapped a top epi­demi­ol­o­gist as health min­is­ter af­ter the pre­vi­ous min­is­ter quit amid a spike in Covid-19 in­fec­tions that has led to the coun­try’s to­tal cases dou­bling within just three weeks.</p>
    <p>In a tele­vised ad­dress on Mon­day evening, Mr Babis re­peated that the gov­ern­ment did not want mass l ock­downs like those in March that shut busi­nesses, restau­rants and schools. He urged peo­ple to stick to ex­ist­ing mea­sures and wear face masks.</p>
    <p>Mr Babis picked Pro­fes­sor Ro­man Pry­mula, who helped to lead the cen­tral Euro­pean coun­try’s re­sponse to the ini­tial coro­n­avirus out­break, to re­place Mr Adam Vo­jtech, who quit on Mon­day af­ter grow­ing crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>“Pro­fes­sor Pry­mula will have cri­sis man­age­ment as his main task,” Mr Babis said.</p>
    <p>Prof Pry­mula is widely seen as a straight talker who once warned Czechs that travel could be dis­rupted for two years be­cause of the coro­n­avirus. He has said that daily cases could swell to 6,000 to 8,000, from around 1,000 to 3,000 now.</p>
    <p>The Czech Repub­lic recorded 1,476 new Covid-19 cases on Mon­day, data from the Health Min­istry showed, bring­ing the over­all num­ber of con­firmed cases to 50,764 – up from 24,618 at the end of last month.</p>
    <p>The Czech Repub­lic’s spike in cases has been the sec­ond fastest in Europe on a rolling two-week ba­sis af­ter Spain when ad­justed for pop­u­la­tion. The jump comes af­ter the coun­try – which was very quick to take strong mea­sures to avoid mass spread­ing in the spring – loos­ened re­stric­tions more than many oth­ers in the sum­mer. It also comes just be­fore re­gional elec­tions less than two weeks away.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s death toll was 522 as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Prof Pry­mula told re­porters that in the com­ing days, the clos­ing time for bars would likely be moved to 10pm from mid­night. “Mass events will un­doubt­edly have to be lim­ited,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Babis, speak­ing along­side Prof Pry­mula, ad­mit­ted that pub­lic health ser­vices were over­whelmed and unable to trace the con­tacts of all in­fected peo­ple within 48 hours in Prague and the cen­tral Czech Repub­lic.</p>
