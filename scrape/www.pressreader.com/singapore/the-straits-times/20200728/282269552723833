    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Amer­i­can Michael Thomp­son felt a “whirl­wind of emotions” af­ter end­ing a 2,702-day wait to win his sec­ond PGA Tour ti­tle at the 3M Open.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old was solid through­out and did not buckle un­der pres­sure, sink­ing a 12-foot putt on the par-five 18th to seal the win un­der sunny skies at TPC Twin Cities.</p>
    <p>Thomp­son, tied for the lead com­ing into Sun­day’s fi­nal round, pro­duced his best shot on the par-four 16th, where his long shot from the green­side bunker landed a cou­ple feet from the hole.</p>
    <p>He made the birdie putt to re­take the lead and never looked back, fin­ish­ing at 19-un­der 265 for the tour­na­ment, which was played with­out fans to limit the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“It has been a long time,” an emo­tional Thomp­son said af­ter his round of four-un­der 67. “I’m re­ally sad my wife and kids aren’t here to cel­e­brate this with me. I can’t wait to see them.”</p>
    <p>Com­pa­triot Adam Long (64), who made the cut on the num­ber, fin­ished sec­ond two strokes back while nine play­ers tied for third at 268 in­clud­ing Tony Finau (68), Max Homa (67) and Richy Weren­ski (70).</p>
    <p>Chi­nese golfer Zhang Xin­jun, joint third af­ter day one, shot a 67 to end tied-12th on 270.</p>
    <p>Thomp­son was ranked world No. 218 ahead of the tour­na­ment in Blaine, Min­nesota af­ter years of fight­ing to keep his pro­fes­sional card.</p>
    <p>“You know, there was a time dur­ing that seven years where I had to go back to the Korn Ferry Tour Fi­nals four years in a row get my card back,” said the 2012 US Open run­ner-up, whose only other vic­tory came at the Honda Clas­sic in 2013.</p>
    <p>“I think through that strug­gle I re­ally so­lid­i­fied the be­lief in my­self that I’m sup­posed to be out here.”</p>
    <p>With his first win in 167 starts, Thomp­son is el­i­gi­ble to play in this week’s WGC Mem­phis event, next month’s PGA Cham­pi­onship, the US Open in Septem­ber and the Mas­ters in Novem­ber.</p>
