    <p>Deep­avali was a more se­date oc­ca­sion this year given the pandemic, but many devo­tees still found ways to give thanks and cel­e­brate the fes­ti­val of lights.</p>
    <p>While some turned up at Hindu tem­ples yes­ter­day to of­fer their prayers and usher in new begin­nings, more chose to per­form their rit­u­als on­line, from the safety of their homes.</p>
    <p>When The Sun­day Times vis­ited the Sri Then­dayutha­pani Tem­ple in Tank Road, masked devo­tees kept a safe dis­tance while of­fer­ing their prayers.</p>
    <p>They also had to un­dergo tem­per­a­ture screen­ing and fol­low a bar­ri­cade sys­tem that di­rected the flow of wor­ship­pers.</p>
    <p>Deep­avali has been “very muted” this year, said Mr Raja Se­gar, the Hindu En­dow­ments Board’s (HEB) chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple un­der­stand the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion and they are aware that they can’t have big gath­er­ings,” he added. “But some of them felt that they should spend a short time at the tem­ples, and we wanted to al­low them to do that.”</p>
    <p>At the four HEB-man­aged tem­ples – Sri Mari­amman Tem­ple, Sri Srini­vasa Peru­mal Tem­ple, Sri Vairav­i­mada Kaliamman Tem­ple and Sri Si­van Tem­ple – vis­i­tors like­wise ob­served safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Live-stream­ing ar­range­ments were pro­vided to al­low devo­tees, par­tic­u­larly se­niors and those un­able to make the jour­ney, to be part of the cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>While many spent the day with their fam­i­lies, clean­ing op­er­a­tions man­ager Ravi M. G. Ra­jasagaran chose to mark this Deep­avali along­side mi­grant work­ers at dor­mi­to­ries, in­clud­ing buy­ing them food.</p>
    <p>He headed home only in the late even­ing to have din­ner with his 30-year-old wife Ma­haletchumi Asokan and two young chil­dren – Theevi­nessh­varen Ravi, seven, and Luu­tikaa Naidu Ravi, four.</p>
    <p>“The cel­e­bra­tions this year are dif­fer­ent with Covid-19, but we are for­tu­nate that we can spend it to­gether,” he added.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, politi­cians also took to so­cial me­dia to con­vey their well wishes.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam wished all In­di­ans who cel­e­brate the fes­ti­val and “ev­ery­one who trea­sures Sin­ga­pore’s mul­ti­cul­tural di­ver­sity” a happy Deep­avali.</p>
    <p>In his post, he re­called a visit two years ago to the an­cient Hindu tem­ple ruins of My Son in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The tem­ple com­plex is a re­minder of the in­ter­ac­tion of cul­tures that made to­day’s South-east Asia, said Mr Thar­man.</p>
    <p>“Some re­li­gions and cul­tures were as­cen­dant for a time, de­pend­ing on which king­dom was rul­ing, and which mer­chants were pre­dom­i­nant. But for­tu­nately, none of the cul­tures has been able to com­pletely erad­i­cate the oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“They are all what has made South-east Asia’s her­itage so rich and com­plex,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Leader of the Op­po­si­tion and Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh shared that it was heart­warm­ing to see res­i­dents of dif­fer­ent faiths and be­liefs ex­tend­ing Deep­avali wishes to their In­dian neigh­bours and friends dur­ing an es­tate walk in his Eunos ward.</p>
    <p>“What­ever your faith, may Deep­avali or the Fes­ti­val of Lights bring peace, joy and hap­pi­ness to you and your loved ones.”</p>
    <p>In a video, For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan ex­tended his wishes to Sin­ga­pore­ans at home and abroad.</p>
    <p>De­spite this year’s Deep­avali be­ing dif­fer­ent – with the need to cel­e­brate in small groups due to the pandemic – the fes­ti­val is a re­minder that “there is al­ways a vic­tory, for hope and for wis­dom, even in dif­fi­cult times”.</p>
