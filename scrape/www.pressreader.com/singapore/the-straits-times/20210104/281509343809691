    <p>The United States recorded yet an­other daily high of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, with more than 277,000 new cases on Satur­day. Top US in­fec­tious diseases ex­pert An­thony Fauci has warned that the worst of the pan­demic may be yet to come for Amer­ica as hol­i­day travel spreads the virus.</p>
    <p>More than 4.2 mil­lion peo­ple in the US have al­ready re­ceived their first jabs, with 13 mil­lion doses dis­trib­uted, but that falls well be­hind the 20 mil­lion shots that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion promised by the end of last year.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States on Satur­day saw its high­est num­ber yet of coro­n­avirus cases recorded in one day, with more than 277,000 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The coun­try hard­est hit by the pan­demic has marked 20.4 mil­lion cases over­all and 350,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions have been surg­ing in re­cent months, with top US gov­ern­ment sci­en­tist An­thony Fauci warning that the worst of the pan­demic may be yet to come, driv­ing the coun­try to a “crit­i­cal point” as hol­i­day travel spreads the virus.</p>
    <p>On the first day of this year, the US sur­passed 20 mil­lion Covid-19 cases – twice as many as the sec­ond-rank­ing na­tion, In­dia.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral states are strug­gling with ris­ing daily cases, deaths and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions amid a lack of a na­tional strat­egy. The coun­try has floun­dered in its ef­forts to quell Covid-19, with its vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme be­set by lo­gis­ti­cal prob­lems.</p>
    <p>More than 4.2 mil­lion peo­ple in the US have al­ready re­ceived their first jabs, with 13 mil­lion doses dis­trib­uted, but that falls well be­hind the 20 mil­lion shots that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion promised by the end of last year.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia, the 53,331 new in­fec­tions re­ported on Satur­day – the most since a record 53,711 cases on Dec 15 – prompted an urgent ap­peal by the state’s health depart­ment for blood do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The in­crease brings the to­tal for the state to al­most 2.35 mil­lion – with only six coun­tries glob­ally hav­ing more in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>New York state passed one mil­lion Covid-19 cases, with more than 15,000 new in­fec­tions on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>More than a third of the state’s to­tal cases were re­ported last month as cold weather nudged peo­ple in­doors, hol­i­days in­creased so­cial gath­er­ings and res­i­dents got tired of re­stric­tions.</p>
