    <p>LON­DON • While it was al­ways a sec­ondary aim to sur­pass Manch­ester City’s record of 100 points set in the 2017-18 sea­son, Jur­gen Klopp had hoped it would prove to be the ex­cla­ma­tion point on an out­stand­ing</p>
    <p>Pre­mier League sea­son.</p>
    <p>But hav­ing achieved their tar­get of a first English top-flight ti­tle in 30 years last month with seven games to spare, Liver­pool have un­der­stand­ably eased off, drop­ping eight points in the five games since.</p>
    <p>As such, the Reds boss in­sisted on Wed­nes­day he was not both­ered about their fail­ure to be­come cen­tu­rion cham­pi­ons, claim­ing noth­ing would put a damp­ener on their achieve­ment this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter un­char­ac­ter­is­tic er­rors saw the vis­i­tors fall to a 2-1 de­feat by Arse­nal, Klopp, whose side can now achieve a max­i­mum tally of 99 points with two games left, said: “I can­not make a neg­a­tive of some­thing so pos­i­tive. I’m not the type of per­son who makes some­thing neg­a­tive out of, ‘But we can­not get the 100’.</p>
    <p>“We will get the points we de­serve and we will see what that will be. At the mo­ment, it’s 93 (points) with two games to go (at home against Chelsea and New­cas­tle away). These boys played an ex­cep­tional sea­son and no­body can take that away from them.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Klopp warned his play­ers that they had to cut out the mis­takes as ev­i­denced at the Emi­rates, lest it be­comes a habit.</p>
    <p>Sa­dio Mane opened the scor­ing for Liver­pool be­fore Vir­gil van Dijk was eas­ily dis­pos­sessed for Alexan­dre La­cazette to equalise via his side’s first strike on tar­get.</p>
    <p>A mis­kicked clear­ance from Alis­son Becker then al­lowed La­cazette to square the ball to Reiss Nel­son for the Gun­ners’ sec­ond, and hav­ing dom­i­nated the ball, it was a kick in the teeth that Klopp be­lieves will be a one-off.</p>
    <p>“The num­bers I saw was 24-3 (shots on goal), 70 to 30 per cent pos­ses­sion, all for us – that’s ex­cep­tional. But the re­sult is the truth and we are re­spon­si­ble for that. We have to make sure things like this will not hap­pen again,” said the Ger­man.</p>
    <p>To put van Dijk’s mis­take into per­spec­tive, this was his first er­ror lead­ing to a goal in the league since March last year against Ful­ham.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man, aim­ing for a sec­ond straight PFA Play­ers’ Player Of The Year ti­tle, owned up to his blun­der. “The goals, we give them as a present,” he said. “If you give the goals away like we did, in­clud­ing my­self, you get what you de­serve.</p>
    <p>“I take the blame for it, I take it as a man and we move on. We’ll try to win the last two games and get a well-de­served break, but we don’t need to for­get that we had a fan­tas­tic sea­son al­ready.”</p>
    <p>Arse­nal joined Wat­ford and Manch­ester City as the only sides to have beaten Liver­pool this sea­son, with two of those de­feats com­ing af­ter the Reds had won the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>But with a 40-point gap be­tween them and the cham­pi­ons, Mikel Arteta ad­mit­ted he has a “mas­sive job” to make the Gun­ners ti­tle con­tenders again.</p>
    <p>“We need a big­ger squad to com­pete in this com­pe­ti­tion. That’s the chal­lenge,” the Spa­niard, whose ninth-placed side look set to miss out on Euro­pean foot­ball for the first time since the 1995-96 sea­son, said.</p>
