    <p>From In­dia to Cam­bo­dia to the farflung ar­chi­pel­ago of Mi­crone­sia, Sin­ga­porean firms in the built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor are strength­en­ing the Repub­lic’s brand around the world through a range of con­struc­tion projects.</p>
    <p>Amid the gloom the lo­cal con­struc­tion in­dus­try is fac­ing with the pan­demic, 36 com­pa­nies were awarded the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity’s (BCA) in­au­gu­ral SGBuilds Award yes­ter­day for 18 in­ter­na­tional projects.</p>
    <p>The awards recog­nised com­pa­nies for suc­cess­fully in­ter­na­tion­al­is­ing and bring­ing lo­cal part­ners over­seas, with the top awards go­ing to real es­tate gi­ant Cap­i­taLand, con­sul­tancy firm TW-Asia Con­sul­tants and post-ten­sion­ing con­trac­tor Utra­con Over­seas.</p>
    <p>The SGBuilds Award has three cat­e­gories – for de­vel­op­ers, con­sul­tants and builders – with the top firm in each cat­e­gory recog­nised with the SGBuilds Star Award.</p>
    <p>Mr Hugh Lim, chief ex­ec­u­tive of BCA, said that the SGBuilds Award serves to hold up in­dus­try ef­forts to in­ter­na­tion­alise in a col­lab­o­ra­tive man­ner.</p>
    <p>“We hope that th­ese awards will in­spire other Sin­ga­pore firms across the en­tire built en­vi­ron­ment value chain to con­sider how to pool their ca­pa­bil­i­ties and re­sources to ven­ture into new mar­kets over­seas,” he said.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand’s win is its 11th col­lab­o­ra­tion with joint ven­ture L&W Con­struc­tion, a part­ner­ship that be­gan in 2009.</p>
    <p>L&W is a fully owned joint ven­ture be­tween con­struc­tion firms Lee Kim Tah and Woh Hup Hold­ings, two of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est con­struc­tion com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing es­tab­lished it­self in In­dia’s IT parks sec­tor since 1994, Cap­i­taLand shared with L&W its strong knowl­edge of In­dia’s busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment and pro­vided the joint ven­ture with op­por­tu­ni­ties to ex­pand in mar­kets that Cap­i­taLand has a pres­ence in, said a Cap­i­taLand spokesman.</p>
    <p>Since the first col­lab­o­ra­tion, the part­ner­ship has gone from strength to strength, with sev­eral Cap­i­taLand In­ter­na­tional Tech Park de­vel­op­ments in ma­jor cities across In­dia, in­clud­ing Cap­i­taLand’s win­ning project in the IT hub of Kharadi, Ma­ha­rash­tra.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, TW-Asia Con­sul­tants took home the SGBuilds Star Award in the con­sul­tant cat­e­gory for an eight-storey re­sort it worked on in Palau, in Mi­crone­sia, slated for com­ple­tion next year.</p>
    <p>BCA lauded TW-Asia as a pi­o­neer for ven­tur­ing into the Pa­cific is­land state, which many in the built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor con­sid­ered a new fron­tier.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion ser­vices firm Utra­con Over­seas was awarded the top prize in the builder cat­e­gory for a six-storey build­ing it built for the Na­tional Bank of Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>This was the firm’s sec­ond project for the bank and has won it a third.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing able to ven­ture out in­ter­na­tion­ally is al­ready chal­leng­ing. On top of that, con­struct­ing a sen­si­tive and se­cured project for a wellestab­lished client is some­thing that many would not take on,” said Mr Khoo Jyh Hao, direc­tor of Utra­con Over­seas.</p>
    <p>He cred­ited part­ners, such as project man­age­ment firm Ate­lier In­ter­na­tional Man­age­ment, for their “vast mar­ket fa­mil­iar­ity in Cam­bo­dia (to meet) the goal of achiev­ing the best project out­come”.</p>
    <p>IN­SPIRE NEW VEN­TURES</p>
    <p>We hope that th­ese awards will in­spire other Sin­ga­pore firms across the en­tire built en­vi­ron­ment value chain to con­sider how to pool their ca­pa­bil­i­ties and re­sources to ven­ture into new</p>
    <p>’’ mar­kets over­seas.</p>
    <p>MR HUGH LIM, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity, on what the SGBuilds Award aims to do.</p>
    <p>NOT AN EASY TASK</p>
    <p>Be­ing able to ven­ture out in­ter­na­tion­ally is al­ready chal­leng­ing. On top of that, con­struct­ing a sen­si­tive and se­cured project for a well-es­tab­lished client is some­thing that many ’’ would not take on.</p>
