    <p>Vet­eran ac­tor Tam Ping Man, who was also known as the “king of voiceovers” in Hong Kong for pro­vid­ing the Can­tonese dub in sev­eral movies, died last Sat­ur­day. He was 86.</p>
    <p>Tam, who had just re­newed his con­tract with Hong Kong broad­caster TVB in May, was di­ag­nosed with late-stage lung can­cer in June.</p>
    <p>His daugh­ter, ac­tress-singer Tam</p>
    <p>Suk Ying, told Hong Kong me­dia he was sent to hos­pi­tal af­ter hav­ing breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties last Fri­day night and died at about 11am on Sat­ur­day.</p>
    <p>She said she was men­tally un­pre­pared for his death as she thought he could sur­vive for one or two more years. She added that he was still men­tally alert and had plans to com­plete more work.</p>
    <p>Tam Ping Man be­gan his ca­reer as a voice ac­tor in the 1950s. He was also the voice of Amer­i­can ac­tor Mar­lon Brando in the movie, The God­fa­ther (1972), and Char­lie Townsend in the Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion se­ries Char­lie’s An­gels (1976 to 1981).</p>
    <p>He then moved to the big screen and acted in his first movie, A New, Im­proved Lady, in 1964. His de­but per­for­mance earned rave re­views and he quit do­ing voice-overs to con­cen­trate on act­ing.</p>
    <p>Tam, who was in­vited to act in dozens of movies af­ter that, formed the com­pany Lee Pic­tures with his fre­quent act­ing part­ner, ac­tress Lee He­ung Kam, in 1970. He later formed his own Tam Pic­tures.</p>
    <p>He also launched more than 30 gramo­phone records. His fa­mous songs in­clude Old Loves Like A Dream and Can You Come Back.</p>
    <p>Tam joined TVB in 1968 as an ac­tor and voice ac­tor and was a men­tor when TVB set up a voice-act­ing train­ing class in 1975.</p>
    <p>He joined Asia Tele­vi­sion in 1991 be­fore re­turn­ing to TVB eight years later.</p>
    <p>He is known for act­ing in movies such as Lucky Seven (1970) and Coun­try Man And The Scav­enger (1976), as well as TV se­ri­als such as The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (1979) and Yes­ter­day’s Glit­ter (1980).</p>
    <p>Tam, who won TVB’s Life­time Achieve­ment Award in 2014, has not ap­peared much in pub­lic in re­cent years due to poor health and a re­duced work­load. He last ap­peared on TVB va­ri­ety show Can­topop At 50 in Fe­bru­ary, where he was in a wheel­chair.</p>
    <p>He is sur­vived by his daugh­ter and a son.</p>
