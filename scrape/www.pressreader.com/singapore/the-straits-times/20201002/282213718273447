    <p>De­spite the re­ces­sion caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic, prices of pri­vate homes in Sin­ga­pore picked up in the third quar­ter as the coun­try en­tered phase two of its re­open­ing af­ter a two-month­long cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The over­all price in­dex for pri­vate res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties rose by 0.8 per cent, faster than the 0.3 per cent rise in the sec­ond quar­ter, yes­ter­day’s flash es­ti­mates from the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) showed.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows a 1 per cent drop in pri­vate home prices in the first quar­ter of this year, their first quar­terly de­cline in a year.</p>
    <p>Year to date, pri­vate home prices edged up 0.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>The lat­est prop­erty mar­ket snap­shot comes af­ter the URA on Mon­day clamped down on de­vel­op­ers reis­su­ing a buyer’s op­tion to pur­chase (OTP) mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>The move is aimed at en­cour­ag­ing fi­nan­cial pru­dence amid Sin­ga­pore’s worst down­turn by en­sur­ing that buy­ers do not end up com­mit­ting to new pri­vate homes they can­not af­ford.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket ex­perts said that seem­ingly ro­bust new pri­vate home sales amid a se­vere re­ces­sion in these past few months may have given rise to a some­what dis­torted per­cep­tion of the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new guide­lines, de­vel­op­ers can no longer reis­sue an OTP to the same buyer for the same unit for 12 months af­ter the orig­i­nal OTP ex­pires.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong Xian Yang, Cush­man & Wake­field’s as­so­ciate di­rec­tor of re­search for Sin­ga­pore and</p>
    <p>South-east Asia, said the pri­vate home mar­ket “re­mained sur­pris­ingly re­silient”, with third-quar­ter prices at their high­est since the same pe­riod in 2013.</p>
    <p>He said this re­flected strong un­der­ly­ing de­mand for pri­vate homes and strong hold­ing power due to un­prece­dented govern­ment sup­port for the econ­omy, which has mit­i­gated dis­tress sales and al­lowed sell­ers to hold on to their sell­ing prices.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with eco­nomic un­cer­tainty ahead and as pent-up de­mand is slowly ab­sorbed, Mr Wong sees de­mand fall­ing in the fourth quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, the new curbs on the reis­suance of OTPs will cause a slight pull­back in mar­ket ac­tiv­i­ties as buy­ers adopt a more cau­tious stance, he said.</p>
    <p>“For the whole of 2020, we ex­pect prices to re­main flat and fluc­tu­ate around a nar­row band at around mi­nus 1 per cent to 1 per cent, given on­go­ing mar­ket mo­men­tum and mar­ket head­winds.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie, said waves of quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing by cen­tral banks around the world to stim­u­late their economies may also have had the ef­fect of push­ing up prop­erty prices.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors’ con­fi­dence was also boosted by an in­crease in for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment, es­pe­cially from health­care firms and tech giants.”</p>
    <p>URA data also showed that prices of pri­vate homes in the city fringes or rest of cen­tral re­gion rose 3.3 per cent in the third quar­ter, com­pared with a 1.7 per cent drop in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, while prices in the out­side cen­tral re­gion gained 1.7 per cent, com­pared with a 0.1 per cent in­crease in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Only prices of non-landed pri­vate homes in the prime ar­eas or core cen­tral re­gion de­clined in the third quar­ter, fall­ing 4.9 per cent com­pared with a 2.7 per cent in­crease in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>URA’s flash es­ti­mates are com­piled based on trans­ac­tion prices given in con­tracts sub­mit­ted for stamp duty pay­ment and data on units sold by de­vel­op­ers up till mid-Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The data will be up­dated on Oct 23, when URA re­leases its full set of real es­tate statis­tics for the third quar­ter.</p>
