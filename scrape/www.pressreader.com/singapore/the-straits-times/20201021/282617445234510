    <p>Tai­wanese ac­tress Ting Hsiao-chin will be go­ing to jail for two years and six months, af­ter the is­land’s Supreme Court up­held a rul­ing by a lower court on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ting, for­mer girl­friend of boy band 5566’s Tony Sun, was con­victed of 13 counts of fraud and vi­o­la­tion of Tai­wan’s Trade­mark Act af­ter she was found guilty of sell­ing fake lux­ury goods. She also failed to de­liver the goods to buy­ers in some in­stances.</p>
    <p>Ting, 41, who is also known by her stage name T-ana, started sell­ing lux­ury goods in 2015. She reg­is­tered ac­counts on sev­eral on­line shop­ping sites to of­fer high­end prod­ucts such as branded bags, shoes, clothes and cos­metic items.</p>
    <p>Ting claimed that the items were “90 per cent new” and came with au­then­tic­ity cards.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said she had made about NT$170,000 (S$8,000) in il­le­gal prof­its from 13 counts of fraud.</p>
    <p>Three buy­ers who bought items be­tween NT$7,500 and NT$40,000 sought re­funds from Ting af­ter find­ing out that the goods were fake.</p>
    <p>An­other nine buy­ers spent be­tween NT$800 and NT$30,000 on what they thought were new goods. But some re­ceived sec­ond-hand goods while oth­ers did not get their items even af­ter they had paid.</p>
    <p>Ting claimed dur­ing the first trial that she was un­sure about the trans­ac­tions as she had lent her ac­counts to a friend named Natasha. But the judge crit­i­cised her for her poor judg­ment and sen­tenced her to jail for three years and six months.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a sec­ond trial, be­fore Tai­wan’s In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Court, Ting ad­mit­ted it was her fault and sought to reach a set­tle­ment with the vic­tims. She also is­sued a pub­lic apol­ogy in the hopes of re­duc­ing her sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Last year, the court up­held her con­vic­tion, but re­duced her sen­tence to two years and six months’ jail.</p>
    <p>Ting came to promi­nence af­ter re­leas­ing her de­but al­bum Danc­ing Spir­its in June 1999. She fol­lowed that up with a sec­ond al­bum, Walk­ing 2000, in De­cem­ber the same year.</p>
    <p>She then turned to act­ing, tak­ing up roles in tele­vi­sion se­ri­als such as To­mor­row (2002) and Cool Wife And Cute Hus­band (2006).</p>
    <p>Ting went into the fash­ion busi­ness af­ter set­ting up her own fash­ion shop Ta­tianna in 2006.</p>
