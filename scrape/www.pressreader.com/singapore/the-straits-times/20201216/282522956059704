    <p>It starts in utero.</p>
    <p>A mass of cells di­vides and de­vel­ops, splits and stretches, and from a sin­gle layer of em­bry­onic tis­sue, two seem­ingly sep­a­rate but in­her­ently in­ter­con­nected sys­tems are born: the brain and the skin.</p>
    <p>They are bound for life. When one senses em­bar­rass­ment, the other blushes. When one senses pain, the other pro­cesses it. And when one bears the bur­den of a pan­demic, po­lit­i­cal un­rest, sys­temic racism and the ever wors­en­ing ef­fects of cli­mate change... well, the other gets a pim­ple.</p>
    <p>Or per­haps, de­pend­ing on your ge­netic pre­dis­po­si­tions, it is not a pim­ple, but an eczema out­break. A pso­ri­a­sis flare-up. A bout of rosacea. A de­hy­drated, dull, oily or even – gasp – older-look­ing ap­pear­ance. Gen­eral blah­ness, if you will. This is your skin on stress.</p>
    <p>“There are two dif­fer­ent types of stress: acute stress and chronic stress,” said Dr Whit­ney Bowe, a der­ma­tol­o­gist and au­thor.</p>
    <p>A quick surge of stress can be a good thing. It may heighten your senses, en­hance men­tal clar­ity and help cre­ate col­la­gen to fa­cil­i­tate wound re­pair. It is there and it is gone.</p>
    <p>It is the chronic, con­tin­u­ing stress, the kind that ev­ery sen­tient be­ing is likely ex­pe­ri­enc­ing right now, that takes a toll on the skin.</p>
    <p>It takes a toll on the en­tire be­ing, of course, and a com­pro­mised com­plex­ion is the least of its con­se­quences. But “the skin is the or­gan we see”, said Dr Loretta Ci­raldo, a der­ma­tol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>Much of the skin-psy­che con­nec­tion comes down to the over­pro­duc­tion of cor­ti­sol, the pri­mary stress hor­mone, and its ef­fect on the skin bar­rier.</p>
    <p>“The bar­rier traps mois­ture in and keeps al­ler­gens, ir­ri­tants and pol­lu­tants out,” Dr Bowe said.</p>
    <p>It needs three things in or­der to thrive: oil, wa­ter and the mi­cro­biome. Cor­ti­sol de­pletes them all.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing times of stress, cor­ti­sol slows the pro­duc­tion of ben­e­fi­cial oils. “We get dry, rough and much more ir­ri­tated be­cause those healthy oils act as a pro­tec­tive layer for us,” Dr Ci­raldo said.</p>
    <p>With­out ad­e­quate lipids to seal in hy­dra­tion, the skin starts to “leak” wa­ter in a process known as transepi­der­mal wa­ter loss.</p>
    <p>At the same time, cor­ti­sol stim­u­lates the over­pro­duc­tion of se­bum, the oil that is im­pli­cated in acne. “So for many of us, our skin seems more oily when we’re un­der stress and it’s more acne-prone,” she said.</p>
    <p>All of this al­ters the skin’s pH level, which com­pro­mises the acid man­tle and cre­ates an in­hos­pitable en­vi­ron­ment for the one tril­lion sym­bi­otic mi­cro-or­gan­isms that ex­ist on and in the skin bar­rier – also known as the mi­cro­biome.</p>
    <p>Un­der ideal con­di­tions, the mi­cro­biome ren­ders top­i­cal skin care all but su­per­flu­ous. There are mi­crobes that feed off se­bum, which helps sus­tain healthy oil lev­els.</p>
    <p>“If you’re not pro­duc­ing enough of those healthy fats and not main­tain­ing a healthy bar­rier though, you’re al­ter­ing the ter­rain on which these mi­crobes grow and thrive,” Dr Bowe said. “Imag­ine strip­ping the soil of all the nu­tri­ents and see­ing if your veg­etable gar­den is go­ing to grow. It’s the same for the skin.”</p>
    <p>In turn, the mi­cro­biome may ex­pe­ri­ence an over­growth of so­called bad bac­te­ria and a dearth of good bac­te­ria.</p>
    <p>The mi­cro­biome be­comes more prone to in­fec­tion, ir­ri­ta­tion, in­flam­ma­tion and hy­per­pig­men­ta­tion. It be­comes more sen­si­tive to out­side ag­gres­sors, like the free rad­i­cals caused by pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Stress prompts the body to pro­duce in­ter­nal free rad­i­cals as well. “You can think of free rad­i­cals like lit­tle mis­siles,” Dr Bowe said, in that they tar­get cells for de­struc­tion and cause ox­ida­tive stress.</p>
    <p>Chronic ex­po­sure to cor­ti­sol also in­hibits the pro­duc­tion of hyaluronic acid and col­la­gen. “These are what keep the skin plump and youth­ful,” Dr Bowe said.</p>
    <p>Manag­ing stress may seem nearly im­pos­si­ble, con­sid­er­ing that so many mod­ern stres­sors are sys­temic.</p>
    <p>Yet ac­cord­ing to Dr Heather Wool­ery-Lloyd, a der­ma­tol­o­gist, “90 per cent of our stress is not the stres­sor it­self, but how we deal with that stres­sor”.</p>
    <p>In other words, while med­i­ta­tion can­not mit­i­gate global warm­ing, it can, at the very least, clear your com­plex­ion.</p>
    <p>Med­i­tat­ing, Dr Wool­ery-Lloyd said, ini­ti­ates “the relaxation re­sponse”, which ac­ti­vates the body’s parasym­pa­thetic ner­vous sys­tem and de­creases cor­ti­sol and in­flam­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Not into med­i­ta­tion? No mat­ter. Breath­ing, which may beat drink­ing wa­ter as the most sim­ple yet ef­fec­tive skin-care tip, is enough.</p>
    <p>Re­search from Dr Her­bert Ben­son at Har­vard Med­i­cal School shows that tak­ing slow, deep breaths trig­gers the relaxation re­sponse and, Dr Bowe said, “can stop psy­cho­log­i­cal stress from be­ing trans­lated to phys­i­cal in­flam­ma­tion in the skin”.</p>
    <p>To ad­dress and pre­vent free rad­i­cal dam­age, fill your plate with an­tiox­i­dants, which sta­bilise these un­sta­ble mol­e­cules to leave skin clearer, calmer, brighter and more even toned.</p>
    <p>Vi­ta­mins A and C (abun­dant in fruit and veg­eta­bles), ly­copene (found in toma­toes), as­tax­an­thin (salmon) and polyphe­nols (green tea, dark choco­late) are all great op­tions, ac­cord­ing to Dr Bowe.</p>
    <p>Ex­er­cise in­creases an­tiox­i­dants as well. It low­ers cor­ti­sol lev­els, mean­ing fewer break­outs and a stronger skin bar­rier. And if you are ex­er­cis­ing out­doors? Even bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Dr Wool­ery-Lloyd said: “Peo­ple say, ‘I don’t have the time,’ but it doesn’t have to be this drawn-out thing. Just go­ing out­side and see­ing a tree and look­ing at a few birds is proven to lower in­flam­ma­tory mark­ers in our body.”</p>
    <p>If all else fails, cry.</p>
    <p>“Cry­ing is a stress re­liever and helps de­crease cor­ti­sol lev­els,” said Dr Purvisha Pa­tel, a der­ma­tol­o­gist and the founder of Visha Skin­care.</p>
    <p>Dr Ci­raldo added: “These are things we can do for our skin and our­selves that don’t cost any­thing, but the re­ward is great.”</p>
    <p>A quick surge of stress can be a good thing. It may heighten your senses, en­hance men­tal clar­ity and help cre­ate col­la­gen to fa­cil­i­tate wound re­pair. It is there and it is gone. It is the chronic, con­tin­u­ing stress... that takes a toll on the skin.</p>
