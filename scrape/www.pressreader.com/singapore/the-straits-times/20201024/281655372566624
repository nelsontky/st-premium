    <p>Shares in Gold­man Sachs rose 1.1 per cent in the first 15 min­utes of trade in New York as an­a­lysts said the raft of set­tle­ments with reg­u­la­tors and pros­e­cu­tors in the United States and across the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, was long-an­tic­i­pated on Wall Street.</p>
    <p>The mag­ni­tude of the penal­ties was also in line with ex­pec­ta­tions, they said.</p>
    <p>The bank, in a state­ment on Thurs­day, said it would book an ad­di­tional US$250 mil­lion (S$339 mil­lion) in the third quar­ter this year to cover the cost of the penal­ties be­yond pre­vi­ous re­serves.</p>
    <p>The set­tle­ment was “an enor­mous price”, Ever­core ISI an­a­lyst Glenn Schor­rwas was quoted as say­ing by Bloomberg News.</p>
    <p>But “it is the price they had to pay to, I would say, have the flex­i­bil­ity to fully run their com­pany and fo­cus on grow­ing and mov­ing the com­pany for­ward”, he said.</p>
    <p>The set­tle­ments lift a le­gal cloud that formed dur­ing for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Lloyd Blank­fein’s ten­ure and re­mained through the hand­off to Mr David Solomon two years ago.</p>
    <p>“This has been a long process, and we are pleased to be putting th­ese mat­ters be­hind us. But we are not putting the lessons learnt from this ex­pe­ri­ence be­hind us,” Mr Solomon wrote in a memo to staff on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“We have to ac­knowl­edge where our firm fell short,” he added.</p>
