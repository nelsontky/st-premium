    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Ally McDon­ald cel­e­brated her 28th birth­day on Sun­day by win­ning her first LPGA ti­tle, cap­tur­ing the Drive On Cham­pi­onship by one stroke over fel­low Amer­i­can Danielle Kang.</p>
    <p>She fired a fi­nal-round three-un­der 69 to fin­ish 72 holes at Reynolds Lake Oconee on 16-un­der 272 in what was a me­morable present.</p>
    <p>“It’s def­i­nitely to­wards the top that’s for sure,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her pre­vi­ous best LPGA fin­ish was third at last year’s Sho­pRite Clas­sic but she al­ways re­tained faith de­spite not win­ning since turn­ing pro in 2015.</p>
    <p>“It just feels like a long time com­ing. I’ve never doubted my abil­ity but it’s re­ally hard to win out here,” said McDon­ald, her voice crack­ing with emo­tion. “I hung in there and I was re­ally happy to get a win.”</p>
    <p>Kang trimmed her lead from four strokes to a sin­gle shot on the back nine but set­tled for sec­ond af­ter shoot­ing 68 to end on 273.</p>
    <p>“It shook me up pretty bad,” McDon­ald said of her ri­val’s late flour­ish. “I had to gather my­self up and get my heart rate un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>“I knew Danielle was go­ing to put the pedal to the metal. I told my­self to calm down and do what I’ve been do­ing, fol­low my game plan and con­trol what I can.</p>
    <p>“I was happy to hang in there and pull it out – just the re­silience I have.”</p>
    <p>Filip­ina Bianca Pag­dan­ganan, the LPGA driv­ing dis­tance leader in only her sixth pro­fes­sional start, shot a 70 to fin­ish third on 274.</p>
    <p>Kang, who orig­i­nally would be seek­ing a third con­sec­u­tive LPGA crown in Shang­hai be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic wiped out the event, had been the joint firstround leader of this newly cre­ated tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>At world No. 5, she was the high­est-ranked player in the field and a win here would have strength­ened her po­si­tion at the Race to CME Globe rank­ings, with j ust three more tour­na­ments.</p>
    <p>The win­ner will earn a US$1.5 mil­lion (S$2.04 mil­lion) cheque – the largest sin­gle prize in women’s golf his­tory, but Kang could not seal her sec­ond Drive On Cham­pi­onship ti­tle af­ter tri­umph­ing in Toledo, Ohio, in Au­gust. “I tried,” she stressed.</p>
