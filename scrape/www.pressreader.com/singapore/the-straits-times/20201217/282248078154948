    <p>While the use of dig­i­tal ser­vices has surged, win­ners of Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal bank li­cences face a long haul to at­tain busi­ness vi­a­bil­ity and re­alise the full po­ten­tial of the lo­cal and broader South-east Asian mar­kets.</p>
    <p>First, it will take them at least a year to ful­fil pru­den­tial and reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments, and raise the re­sources – cap­i­tal and man­power – as well as put to­gether the nec­es­sary tech­no­log­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture to launch their op­er­a­tions in earnest.</p>
    <p>Next, in a mar­ket like Sin­ga­pore’s, with dom­i­nant in­cum­bent banks, the new­com­ers may face dif­fi­culty out-in­vest­ing lead­ing con­ven­tional banks in dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion to of­fer a dis­tinc­tive value propo­si­tion be­yond niche ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Tim­ing-wise, early 2022 would prob­a­bly be the most op­por­tune pe­riod to kick-start a new busi­ness. By that time, most – if not all – economies in the re­gion would have re­cov­ered from the de­bil­i­tat­ing shock de­liv­ered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing and lock­downs associated with Covid-19 have ac­cel­er­ated the shift to­wards dig­i­tal ser­vices, in­clud­ing bank­ing.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the chal­lenges posed by the pan­demic-driven down­turn to the busi­ness mod­els of vir­tual banks world­wide may of­fer valu­able lessons for new­com­ers on sur­viv­ing, and even thriv­ing, through a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Some of the mo­men­tum of the surge in dig­i­tal us­age is likely to per­sist in the post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses and con­sumers fresh out of the pall of gloom cast by the pan­demic may look for new and more ac­ces­si­ble sources to whet their re­newed ap­petite for in­vest­ment and re­tail spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Reach­ing out to un­der­banked in­di­vid­u­als and un­der­served busi­nesses by in­cor­po­rat­ing in­no­va­tive tech­nol­ogy – such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence – is, in fact, the key value propo­si­tion of dig­i­tal banks that sets them apart from the tra­di­tional in­cum­bents.</p>
    <p>But win­ning the trust and loy­alty of the un­banked and un­der­served seg­ments, who have been dis­pro­por­tion­ately hit by the eco­nomic shock, may take time, and keep op­por­tu­ni­ties for prof­itable lend­ing few and far be­tween in early days.</p>
    <p>Also, Sin­ga­pore is not ex­actly</p>
    <p>Reach­ing out to un­der­banked in­di­vid­u­als and un­der­served busi­nesses by in­cor­po­rat­ing in­no­va­tive tech­nol­ogy – such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence – is, in fact, the key value propo­si­tion of dig­i­tal banks that sets them apart from the tra­di­tional in­cum­bents. But win­ning the trust and loy­alty of the un­banked and un­der­served seg­ments, who have been dis­pro­por­tion­ately hit by the eco­nomic shock, may take time, and keep op­por­tu­ni­ties for prof­itable lend­ing few and far be­tween in early days.</p>
    <p>con­sid­ered an un­banked or un­der­served mar­ket. So un­less the dig­i­tal banks here can spread out their ser­vices to the rest of South-east Asia, their prof­itabil­ity will re­main a ques­tion.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, South Korea’s Kakao Bank achieved break-even – the point at which cost and in­come are equal – in about two years from its launch in mid-2017.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has only one-tenth of the pop­u­la­tion of South Korea, and its in­cum­bent banks – DBS, OCBC and UOB – are far more dig­i­tally ad­vanced than their North Asian peers.</p>
    <p>The jour­ney to busi­ness vi­a­bil­ity took time, even though the mo­bile-only bank – built on the back of its pop­u­lar mes­sag­ing plat­form Kakao Talk – at­tracted a whop­ping 300,000 ac­counts in the first 24 hours af­ter its launch.</p>
    <p>In terms of con­sumer lend­ing, ex­clud­ing hous­ing mort­gages, Kakao’s loan port­fo­lio stands at just 2.6 per cent of the South Korean mar­ket and it took three years to se­cure that share.</p>
    <p>The Grab-Sing­tel con­sor­tium – one of two win­ners of a dig­i­tal full bank li­cence – is likely to take more time to achieve break-even and may strug­gle to se­cure a size­able share in the con­sumer loan mar­ket here.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause the Grab-Sing­tel sub­scriber base spread across South-east Asia comes to about</p>
    <p>190 mil­lion, and a much smaller num­ber of those sub­scribers are on Sing­tel’s Dash wal­let and Grab Pay.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, Kakao Bank started with the 220 mil­lion global sub­scriber base of Kakao Talk.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis did not just boost de­mand for dig­i­tal ser­vices, it also trig­gered a flight to qual­ity that ben­e­fited tra­di­tional banks, in terms of ac­cess to fund­ing.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis has also forced these es­tab­lished banks to ac­cel­er­ate their dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts, re­duc­ing the risk of com­pla­cency, and po­ten­tially clos­ing off open­ings for new en­trants.</p>
    <p>Still, an­other win­ner of a dig­i­tal full bank li­cence – Sea – may have an edge, given its ex­ten­sive global foot­print.</p>
    <p>Putting to­gether the user base of its ex­ist­ing plat­forms – Garena for dig­i­tal en­ter­tain­ment, Shopee for e-com­merce and SeaMoney for fi­nan­cial ser­vices – the to­tal comes to about 685 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Part of that user base can be mon­e­tised for starters and gives Sea a sub­stan­tial ad­van­tage over its com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>The New York-listed Sea can also ex­ploit the large vol­ume of high-fre­quency and real-time data on its ex­ist­ing plat­forms for devel­op­ing credit mod­els and in­ter­nal dig­i­tal-only risk man­age­ment frame­works.</p>
    <p>Shopee alone can pro­vide Sea with the per­fect spring­board to launch fi­nan­cial bank­ing ser­vices – trans­ac­tional ac­counts and mer­chant loans – across South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce pen­e­tra­tion is, how­ever, quite weak in this re­gion. For in­stance, the pen­e­tra­tion rate in In­done­sia is less than 3 per cent.</p>
    <p>While the un­der­pen­e­tra­tion rep­re­sents a huge op­por­tu­nity if new dig­i­tal banks here can come up with user-friendly apps to ac­cess their fi­nan­cial prod­ucts and ser­vices, it is also a re­al­ity check on the lack of tech-savvi­ness among re­gional small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs).</p>
    <p>SMEs are a tar­get mar­ket for dig­i­tal full banks and the only fo­cus area for dig­i­tal whole­sale banks.</p>
    <p>How­ever, SMEs across the re­gion con­tinue to strug­gle with ex­tract­ing the full ben­e­fits of the emerg­ing dig­i­tal economy, even in coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore, where the Gov­ern­ment has sev­eral schemes to help them get con­nected.</p>
    <p>So, dig­i­tal banks may have to play a key role in ed­u­cat­ing their com­mer­cial clients on how to ac­cess their ser­vices and loans – an area where in­cum­bent tra­di­tional banks are al­ready quite ac­tive.</p>
    <p>The need for, and com­pe­ti­tion to de­velop, user-friendly and ed­u­ca­tional apps can open up some in­ter­est­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for the fin­tech com­mu­nity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>If the new­com­ers and in­cum­bents ag­gres­sively tap the ex­per­tise of lo­cal fin­techs, the ben­e­fits may spill across Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial in­dus­try and jobs mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Ant Group’s suc­cess in win­ning a dig­i­tal whole­sale bank li­cence guar­an­tees heated com­pe­ti­tion on the tech­no­log­i­cal front.</p>
    <p>Ant’s par­ent is China’s fin­tech and e-com­merce gi­ant Alibaba, owner of Alibaba Cloud, which of­fers ev­ery­thing from elec­tronic clear­ing ser­vices and e-learn­ing cour­ses to vir­tual servers for pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Such com­peti­tors, with the right pedi­gree and fi­nan­cial and tech­no­log­i­cal re­sources, may pose a greater com­pet­i­tive threat over the medium term to the re­gion’s dig­i­tally less-pre­pared ri­vals.</p>
