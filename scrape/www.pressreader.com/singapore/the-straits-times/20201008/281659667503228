    <p>The forces of dark­ness, the forces of di­vi­sion, the forces of yes­ter­day are pulling us apart, hold­ing us down and hold­ing us back... We can­not and will not al­low ex­trem­ists and white su­prem­a­cists to over­turn the Amer­ica of (Abra­ham) Lin­coln and (abo­li­tion­ists) Har­riet Tub­man and Fred­er­ick Dou­glass, to over­turn the Amer­ica that has been a haven and a home for ev­ery­one no mat­ter their back­ground.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>GET­TYS­BURG White House hope­ful Joe Bi­den has warned that “the forces of dark­ness” are di­vid­ing Amer­i­cans, say­ing that as pres­i­dent, he would strive to “end the hate and fear” con­sum­ing the na­tion.</p>
    <p>In a speech on Tues­day at an out­door site over­look­ing the hal­lowed Civil War bat­tle­field of Get­tys­burg, the Demo­cratic chal­lenger to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump i n next month’s elec­tion con­demned the rise of white na­tion­al­ism and said the coun­try needed to unite.</p>
    <p>“The forces of dark­ness, the forces of di­vi­sion, the forces of yes­ter­day are pulling us apart, hold­ing us down and hold­ing us back,” Mr Bi­den said in a speech near where Abra­ham Lin­coln de­liv­ered his in­spi­ra­tional Get­tys­burg Ad­dress in 1863.</p>
    <p>“We can­not and will not al­low ex­trem­ists and white su­prem­a­cists to over­turn the Amer­ica of Lin­coln and (abo­li­tion­ists) Har­riet Tub­man and Fred­er­ick Dou­glass, to over­turn the Amer­ica that has been a haven and a home for ev­ery­one, no mat­ter their back­ground,” Mr Bi­den added.</p>
    <p>The 77-year-old for­mer vi­cepres­i­dent who leads in polling four weeks from elec­tion day did not men­tion Mr Trump’s name, but his re­marks served as a clear re­buke of a Repub­li­can pres­i­dent whose re­lent­less rhetoric has raised ten­sions na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s speech, at­tended by a small con­tin­gent of sup­port­ers who abided by so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, no­tably came one week af­ter Mr Trump, who has branded him­self a “law and or­der” pres­i­dent, failed to di­rectly con­demn white na­tion­al­ism dur­ing their con­tentious de­bate in Cleve­land.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said: “I do not be­lieve we have to choose be­tween law and or­der and racial justice in Amer­ica. We can have both.”</p>
    <p>But he stressed that “as pres­i­dent... I will send a clear, un­equiv­o­cal mes­sage to the en­tire na­tion: There is no place for hate in Amer­ica. It will be given no li­cence, it will be given no oxy­gen, it will be given no safe har­bour”.</p>
    <p>His speech was in­tended to serve as a call for unity af­ter months of bit­ter di­vi­sions, but he also said he was “con­cerned” about what he sees to­day. “The coun­try is in a dan­ger­ous place, our trust in each other is ebbing, hope seems elu­sive”, and pol­i­tics is no longer a fo­rum for me­di­at­ing dif­fer­ences but a bat­tle­ground for “to­tal, un­re­lent­ing par­ti­san war­fare”, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den re­peat­edly in­voked the lan­guage of Lin­coln in his speech, say­ing “there’s no more fit­ting place than here to­day, in Get­tys­burg, to talk about the cost of di­vi­sion”.</p>
    <p>“To­day, once again, we are a house di­vided. But that, my friends, can no longer be,” he said.</p>
    <p>MR JOE BI­DEN, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent and Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, on the rise of white na­tion­al­ism in the US.</p>
