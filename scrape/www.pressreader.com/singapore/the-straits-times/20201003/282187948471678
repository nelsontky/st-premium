    <p>Tour agency STA Travel, which is be­ing wound up af­ter it stopped op­er­a­tions last month, owes its cred­i­tors – mainly cus­tomers and for­mer em­ploy­ees – nearly $1.43 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to a fi­nan­cial state­ment that was pre­pared by the firm’s di­rec­tors and seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The state­ment of the com­pany’s as­sets and li­a­bil­i­ties – as of Sept 10 – was shown to the cred­i­tors at their meet­ing with pro­vi­sional liq­uida­tor Deloitte and Touche yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It showed that STA Travel owes cus­tomers $635,000 while an­other $439,000 is due to be paid to its for­mer em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether, the sum amount­ing to $1.07 mil­lion con­sti­tutes three-quar­ters of the com­pany’s as­cer­tained li­a­bil­i­ties which come up to $1.43 mil­lion as of Sept 10.</p>
    <p>Of the firm’s $1.45 mil­lion worth of as­sets, only $746,000 is listed as es­ti­mated re­al­is­able value, which leaves STA Travel with a net li­a­bil­ity of $679,000 if it liq­ui­dates all its as­sets to pay the cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Au­dit firm Deloitte said at the meet­ing that only about a third of all 682 cred­i­tors have filed claims to date.</p>
    <p>The wind­ing-up process is ex­pected to be com­pleted in the last quar­ter of next year or the first quar­ter of 2022, it added.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s meet­ing comes af­ter Deloitte is­sued a no­tice on Sept 24 to STA Travel’s po­ten­tial cred­i­tors, in­form­ing them that the com­pany was wind­ing up.</p>
    <p>The tour agency stopped op­er­at­ing on Sept 9, af­ter its par­ent com­pany, based in Switzer­land, filed for in­sol­vency in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore branch’s cred­i­tors, which in­clude both in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions, are owed sums be­tween $7 and $84,088.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the road ahead for the cred­i­tors to re­coup their money is long.</p>
    <p>Based on an es­ti­mated time­line Deloitte shown to the cred­i­tors yes­ter­day, it will take at least six months be­fore STA Travel can re­cover its as­sets, with April next year given as the ear­li­est date.</p>
    <p>Af­ter that, the com­pany has to set­tle its costs of liq­ui­da­tion and pay any salaries or re­trench­ment ben­e­fits owed to its for­mer em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>And only af­ter STA Travel has paid its statu­tory taxes will un­se­cured cred­i­tors be paid.</p>
    <p>Deloitte told ST that af­ter re­cov­er­ing STA Travel’s as­sets, it will take an­other two months be­fore any div­i­dend or re­turn to cred­i­tors can be de­clared.</p>
    <p>Many of the tour agency’s for­mer cus­tomers, who bought travel pack­ages through it, are likely to be un­se­cured cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>For them, there may or may not be enough money left for them af­ter STA Travel ful­fils its other pay­ment obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Amo­lat Singh told ST that cus­tomers may be able to re­cover only a frac­tion of what they paid, or noth­ing at all.</p>
    <p>“Cus­tomers are in the most un­en­vi­able po­si­tion be­cause com­pa­nies are bound by the law to pay other cred­i­tors first, such as banks they owe money to or their for­mer em­ploy­ees,” he said.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Singh noted that no one could have seen an event as ex­cep­tional as Covid-19 com­ing, adding that the cus­tomers “did all they could, hav­ing pur­chased from a rep­utable com­pany which is un­likely to have col­lapsed if not for the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>While Deloitte orig­i­nally said that the cred­i­tors had to file their claims by the end of last month, it told them dur­ing yes­ter­day’s meet­ing that they have un­til June next year to do so.</p>
    <p>One cus­tomer, sports trainer Mo­hamad Azni, 59, who is claim­ing $21,162 for flights booked for mem­bers of his mar­tial arts club, thinks that it is un­likely he will get their money back.</p>
    <p>“But we hope for the best and ex­pect the worst,” he said.</p>
