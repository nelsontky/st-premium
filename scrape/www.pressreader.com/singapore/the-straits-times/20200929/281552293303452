    <p>Por­tuguese Ruben Dias’ (right) ar­rival at Manch­ester City shortly for €68 mil­lion (S$109 mil­lion) from Ben­fica will not solve all their back­line is­sues, go­ing by their aw­ful dis­play in the 5-2 drub­bing by Le­ices­ter in Sun­day’s Premier League game. City fared lit­tle bet­ter up front, with in­juries forc­ing play­ers out of po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON As Pep Guardi­ola pre­pares to take his spend­ing on de­fend­ers to over £400 mil­lion (S$708.6 mil­lion), his side’s 5-2 ca­pit­u­la­tion against Le­ices­ter showed that Ruben Dias’ im­pend­ing ar­rival alone might not be suf­fi­cient to solve their de­fen­sive is­sues.</p>
    <p>It was the first time in 686 games that a team man­aged by Guardi­ola con­ceded five goals, with Jamie Vardy be­com­ing the only player to score two hat-tricks against sides led by the for­mer Barcelona and Bay­ern Mu­nich boss.</p>
    <p>City went ahead at the Eti­had af­ter just four min­utes thanks to for­mer Le­ices­ter for­ward Riyad Mahrez’s thun­der­ous strike. But that was as good as it got for City as Vardy tore their creaky de­fence to pieces with his pace and move­ment on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He won two penal­ties on a night when Eric Gar­cia, Kyle Walker and Ben­jamin Mendy com­mit­ted iden­ti­cal mistakes, get­ting caught out to con­cede three spot-kicks.</p>
    <p>Vardy con­verted both penal­ties ei­ther side of a classy back-heel fin­ish, while James Mad­di­son added a fourth. Youri Tiele­mans com­pleted City’s em­bar­rass­ment with a late penalty af­ter new sign­ing Nathan Ake scored his first City goal.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola rued his team’s lack of com­po­sure but vowed to bounce back af­ter City con­ceded five goals in the league at home for the first time since a 5-1 de­feat by Arse­nal in Fe­bru­ary 2003.</p>
    <p>“It’s a tough re­sult but I am not go­ing to give up. I am go­ing to find so­lu­tions for the team to be sta­ble,” said the Spa­niard, who had at­tempted to pro­tect his back­line by de­ploy­ing Fer­nand­inho and Ro­dri in front of them.</p>
    <p>“My play­ers might have thought that they weren’t play­ing well enough af­ter con­ced­ing the equaliser but we were well on top at that stage. The prob­lem was that we put ex­tra pres­sure on our­selves to score the sec­ond and third.</p>
    <p>“We need to be more calm, we don’t have the play­ers to at­tack the box that we need.”</p>
    <p>With both nat­u­ral strik­ers Ser­gio Aguero and Gabriel Je­sus out in­jured, City looked tooth­less de­spite hav­ing the lion’s share of the pos­ses­sion. For­mer Manch­ester United mid­fielder Darren Fletcher be­lieves the lack of a recog­nised fin­isher had a knock-on ef­fect on their over­all dis­play, and with the duo set to re­main un­avail­able for weeks, City have more puz­zles to solve.</p>
    <p>“Pep usu­ally goes with a sin­gle pivot as part of a 4-3-3,” he told the BBC. “But with the play­ers he had avail­able, he went with two hold­ing mid­field­ers... and moved Kevin de Bruyne to more of a No. 10 po­si­tion, be­hind Ra­heem Ster­ling who was play­ing as a cen­tral striker.</p>
    <p>“City had three, four or even five play­ers out of po­si­tion – or at least not play­ing in their best po­si­tion – and, on top of that, their full-backs never of­fered any­thing at­tack­ing­wise down the flanks.”</p>
    <p>An­other mit­i­gat­ing fac­tor was the ab­sence of their No. 1 cen­tre­back Aymeric La­porte, who was only fit enough to make it to the bench, with his new part­ner set to be Dias once his move from Ben­fica is rat­i­fied.</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese club re­vealed they have agreed a deal to sell the 23-year-old for €68 mil­lion (S$108.9 mil­lion) plus add-ons, with City’s Ni­co­las Ota­mendi go­ing the other way in a sep­a­rate trans­fer for €15 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Dias made 137 ap­pear­ances dur­ing a four-year spell with Ben­fica, win­ning the league ti­tle last year.</p>
    <p>For­mer Eng­land de­fender Gary Neville said Guardi­ola is fac­ing the big­gest chal­lenge of his ca­reer with City’s de­fence de­spite man­ag­ing to add the Por­tu­gal in­ter­na­tional, who was part of the side that lifted the Na­tions League tro­phy last year.</p>
    <p>“Some of the wounds from last sea­son are reap­pear­ing. The bugs that cost them the ti­tle,” he told Sky Sports. “Cer­tainly, you can get at this Manch­ester City back four a lot quicker that you could pre­vi­ously. They don’t seem to re­act in tran­si­tion higher up as they did.”</p>
