    <p>When Sin­ga­porean Johnne Lee en­coun­tered ar­ti­sans in Thai­land prac­tis­ing the art of lost-wax cast­ing five years ago, he was im­me­di­ately drawn to it.</p>
    <p>Lost-wax cast­ing is a method of cre­at­ing metal-crafted items, whereby a molten metal is poured into a mould orig­i­nally cre­ated by means of a wax or resin model. In­tri­cate de­signs can be achieved with this method due to the softer tex­ture of wax.</p>
    <p>In­trigued, Mr Lee – a Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts graphic de­sign grad­u­ate – was keen to cre­ate his own prod­ucts that way.</p>
    <p>He ini­tially wanted to send his de­signs to Thai­land, but found that sup­pli­ers there wanted to charge him more than three times the value of the items.</p>
    <p>So he started his own busi­ness – The Imperial Smith­ster.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old bach­e­lor says: “My mum told me, ‘if you’re go­ing to do some­thing your­self, why not just do every­thing your­self?’”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee took a year off work – he had run an events plan­ning firm for five years – to learn the craft, mostly through YouTube tu­to­ri­als and prac­tis­ing at home us­ing ba­sic equip­ment.</p>
    <p>He sold his wares – mainly jew­ellery pieces – on Etsy, an ecom­merce site with a fo­cus on hand­made goods. To­day, he sells them on his com­pany’s web­site, www.theim­pe­ri­al­smith­ster.com.</p>
    <p>He also takes re­quests, such as for one-of-a-kind en­gage­ment rings, and con­ducts lost-wax cast­ing work­shops.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t easy to teach my­self the craft. There was a lot of trial and er­ror,” re­calls Mr Lee, whose busi­ness started turn­ing a profit soon af­ter he be­gan sell­ing his prod­ucts on­line in 2015.</p>
    <p>He adds: “I was lucky be­cause some Amer­i­can cus­tomers pur­chased my prod­ucts and gave the busi­ness mo­men­tum.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who pre­vi­ously ran his busi­ness out of his fa­ther’s of­fice in Defu Lane, found a ded­i­cated stu­dio space in Joo Chiat last year.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther’s busi­ness deals in wire har­nesses.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee says: “Busi­ness has picked up since then be­cause it’s a nicer space and more peo­ple are com­fort­able com­ing for work­shops here.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, the de­mand for the work­shops picked up. I guess peo­ple want new hob­bies.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee hopes to ex­pand his cat­a­logue to home­ware such as cus­tomised uten­sils and dec­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>The ver­sa­til­ity of lost-wax cast­ing is ap­peal­ing.</p>
    <p>“As long as it is from wax to metal and fits in­side my cast­ing flask, I can make some­thing,” he says.</p>
    <p>While the method – re­port­edly go­ing back more than 6,000 years – is one of the old­est ways to cre­ate metal items, Mr Lee is keep­ing up with the times with his work.</p>
    <p>In­stead of al­ways cre­at­ing and carv­ing wax mod­els by hand, he uses a 3D printer to cre­ate de­signs that are then printed in ei­ther wax or resin.</p>
    <p>“Very, very good crafts­men can repli­cate their de­sign ex­actly the same on both sides of a model, but it’s quite chal­leng­ing. With a 3D printer, you can make sure the de­signs are sym­met­ri­cal us­ing the com­puter be­fore you print it,” he says.</p>
    <p>His de­sire for bet­ter de­signs and higher-qual­ity work boils down to his hope for a more vi­brant arts and crafts scene in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I know the arts may be con­ven­tion­ally con­sid­ered a se­cond- or third-tier ca­reer here. But per­haps be­cause I stud­ied in an arts school, I feel a re­spon­si­bil­ity to make sure ar­ti­sanal work in Sin­ga­pore doesn’t die out.”</p>
