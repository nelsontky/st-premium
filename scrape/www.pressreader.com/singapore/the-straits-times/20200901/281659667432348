    <p>In the cur­rent dif­fi­cult eco­nomic cli­mate, it is all the more im­por­tant that Sin­ga­pore­ans are given fair op­por­tu­ni­ties to find mean­ing­ful work. Com­pa­nies will not be al­lowed to prac­tise wan­ton dis­crim­i­na­tion against lo­cal work­ers, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He told Par­lia­ment that Min­istry of Man­power of­fi­cers are work­ing “dou­bly hard” on this front, and have been step­ping up their scru­tiny and en­force­ment ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will give Sin­ga­porean job seek­ers a stronger boost “by work­ing with busi­nesses to give more se­ri­ous con­sid­er­a­tion to Sin­ga­pore­ans when hir­ing, es­pe­cially those who are wil­ing to ad­just their ex­pec­ta­tions and adapt”, he added.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses are also ex­pected to strive harder to strengthen their</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean core, he said in his maiden speech in the House.</p>
    <p>But he re­as­sured em­ploy­ers that Sin­ga­pore will not turn away global tal­ents and in­vest­ments, as skilled for­eign work­ers al­low it to re­main glob­ally com­pet­i­tive and pro­vide learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who is also a Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try, made th­ese points as he pledged to sup­port two key groups of work­ers – young grad­u­ates and ma­ture work­ers – whom he said had a “grow­ing con­cen­tra­tion of dis­en­gaged Sin­ga­pore­ans”.</p>
    <p>“We must al­ways re­mem­ber that our work­ers are the heart of our econ­omy, and we must help our work­force to emerge stronger from this cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ma­ture work­ers are “near and dear” to him, Dr Tan, 55, added. “Our ma­ture work­ers in their 40s and 50s have con­trib­uted a good part of their lives to our econ­omy,” he said. They pos­sess “a sig­nif­i­cant trea­sure of ex­pe­ri­en­tial knowl­edge and prac­tice wis­dom that can­not be re­placed by or gleaned from aca­demic pur­suits or qual­i­fi­ca­tions”.</p>
    <p>As they strive to pre­pare for new job roles, em­ploy­ers should con­sider them fairly and of­fer them good op­por­tu­ni­ties for im­prove­ment and pro­gres­sion, he added.</p>
    <p>As for young grad­u­ates, Dr Tan said he has re­ceived feed­back that they are wor­ried about, among other things, get­ting a job in the cur­rent labour market. His mes­sage: “Although you may seem to have been dealt a dif­fi­cult start­ing hand, we will do all we can to en­sure that your gen­er­a­tion will still flour­ish and ful­fil your po­ten­tial.”</p>
    <p>He also urged all job seek­ers, re­gard­less of age and back­ground, to be re­al­is­tic in their ex­pec­ta­tions and to keep an open mind about avail­able op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>To con­tinue to do well and thrive,</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must be ex­cep­tional, he said.</p>
    <p>“Ex­cep­tional in our dreams and as­pi­ra­tions, ex­cep­tional in our ex­e­cu­tion and im­ple­men­ta­tion, and most im­por­tant of all, ex­cep­tional in the way we care for one an­other and carry one an­other.”</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh on whether step­ping up action en­tailed rais­ing the bud­get for the anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion watch­dog Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep), Dr Tan said the min­istry is look­ing at beef­ing up re­sources to scru­ti­nise un­fair hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>As for whether the min­istry was still see­ing er­rant or un­co­op­er­a­tive em­ploy­ers in spite of the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work, in­tro­duced in 2014 to en­sure fair hir­ing for Sin­ga­pore­ans, Dr Tan said that be­sides mon­i­tor­ing such firms, MOM will work with them to un­der­stand how they had too many for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>“That is the kind of en­gage­ment I was al­lud­ing to. Suf­fice to say, to­day we have stepped up, we are all work­ing very hard to make sure that the com­pa­nies work with the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties to en­sure that fair hir­ing, non-dis­crim­i­na­tory prac­tices are more preva­lent,” he added.</p>
