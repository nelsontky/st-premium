    <p>A Sin­ga­porean man who fled from a car in­volved in a high-speed chase last Satur­day morn­ing has been ar­rested.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) said the 29-year-old man was ar­rested on Wed­nes­day for sus­pected drug traf­fick­ing of­fences. The po­lice are also in­ves­ti­gat­ing him for traf­fic-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>In the same op­er­a­tion, CNB also nabbed four other Sin­ga­pore­ans – two men and two women aged be­tween 25 and 34 – for sus­pected drug of­fences.</p>
    <p>About 7g of metham­phetamine, also known as Ice, was seized in raids con­ducted in mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The car chase, which took place at about 1.10am last Satur­day, was caught on cam­era. A video of the car chase was widely shared on­line.</p>
    <p>Traf­fic Po­lice of­fi­cers were pa­trolling along the Cen­tral Ex­press­way to­wards Sele­tar Ex­press­way, near Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 1, when they came across a driver who was driv­ing at a rel­a­tively slow speed on the ex­treme right lane.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier state­ment, the po­lice said one of the of­fi­cers sig­nalled to the driver to stop the car so they could con­duct a check, but he re­fused and sped off.</p>
    <p>A high-speed chase en­sued be­fore the car mounted a kerb in Can­berra Street and crashed into a tree.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old male driver was ar­rested for dan­ger­ous driv­ing, driv­ing with­out a valid driv­ing li­cence and sus­pected drug-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his male pas­sen­ger man­aged to get away.</p>
    <p>CNB said its of­fi­cers es­tab­lished the iden­tity of the pas­sen­ger af­ter “ex­ten­sive in­ves­ti­ga­tions”.</p>
    <p>Checks showed that he was picked up by a 34-year-old man in a van af­ter he fled from the scene of the crash.</p>
    <p>The van driver was ar­rested on Tues­day in the vicin­ity of Cor­po­ra­tion Walk for sus­pected drug of­fences.</p>
    <p>In a fol­low-up op­er­a­tion that evening, CNB of­fi­cers ar­rested a 31-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman in the vicin­ity of Ho Ching Road.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a search of their res­i­den­tial unit, a packet con­tain­ing about 1g of Ice was found, along with var­i­ous drug para­pher­na­lia, said CNB.</p>
    <p>It emerged that the woman had pur­chased the packet of Ice from the male pas­sen­ger about two weeks ear­lier.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day af­ter­noon, CNB of­fi­cers raided the hide­out of the 29-year-old man in the vicin­ity of An­chor­vale Road. They had to force their way in as he “re­fused to heed the law­ful or­ders of the of­fi­cers to open the door”.</p>
    <p>CNB said the man also turned vi­o­lent when of­fi­cers moved in to ar­rest him.</p>
    <p>A 31-year-old woman at the scene was also ar­rested for sus­pected drug ac­tiv­i­ties. She had a four-month-old in­fant with her.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers found seven pack­ets con­tain­ing about 6g of Ice in to­tal and var­i­ous drug para­pher­na­lia in the unit.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that the woman had been abus­ing Ice dur­ing her preg­nancy, said CNB, adding that the in­fant is cur­rently in the safe cus­tody of a rel­a­tive.</p>
