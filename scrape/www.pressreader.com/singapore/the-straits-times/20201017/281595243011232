    <p>Em­ploy­ers have been given the green light by the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil to im­ple­ment tem­po­rary wage cuts if it means saving jobs. They should seek em­ploy­ees’ sup­port be­fore do­ing so, and make only the cuts nec­es­sary to min­imise re­trench­ments, ac­cord­ing to up­dated guide­lines that will ap­ply from Nov 1 to June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers have been given the green light by the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil (NWC) to im­ple­ment tem­po­rary wage cuts if it means saving jobs.</p>
    <p>They should seek em­ploy­ees’ sup­port be­fore do­ing so and make only the re­duc­tions nec­es­sary to min­imise re­trench­ments, the tri­par­tite body said yes­ter­day, in up­dated guide­lines that will ap­ply from</p>
    <p>Nov 1 to June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>The quan­tum of the cuts should de­pend on the sec­tor’s and com­pany’s out­look, and em­ploy­ees should be told how the wages will even­tu­ally be re­stored.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines, which are not com­pul­sory but have been ac­cepted by the Gov­ern­ment, come af­ter the coun­cil was con­vened in Au­gust for a sec­ond time this year.</p>
    <p>Among other key prin­ci­ples, they rec­om­mend that em­ploy­ers use the an­nual and monthly vari­able com­po­nents to ad­just wages and cut ba­sic pay only if re­ally nec­es­sary to avoid re­trench­ments. Man­age­ments should take ear­lier and deeper cuts to their wages.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil also said wages should be frozen in­stead of cut for work­ers earn­ing up to $1,400 a month. Cuts for those earn­ing more than that should not leave ba­sic monthly pay be­low $1,400.</p>
    <p>Coun­cil chair­man Peter Seah said the tri­par­tite body tried to come up with so­lu­tions that were good for both firms and em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing note of the rec­om­men­da­tions, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said on Face­book: “While painful, em­ploy­ers, unions and em­ploy­ees must work to­gether to im­ple­ment tem­po­rary wage cuts to the ex­tent nec­es­sary to keep re­trench­ment down.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress pres­i­dent Mary Liew said the labour move­ment agreed that there was a need to sup­port “more dras­tic, im­me­di­ate mea­sures” be­cause of the need to min­imise re­trench­ments af­ter ef­forts to re­tain and re­de­ploy ex­ist­ing work­ers have been ex­hausted.</p>
    <p>“Sac­ri­fice will def­i­nitely be re­quired on the work­ers’ part, but we hope that em­ploy­ers will bear their sac­ri­fices in mind when things get bet­ter, when­ever pos­si­ble recog­nise their ef­forts and re­ward them as well,” she said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Robert Yap said em­ploy­ers may still face sig­nif­i­cant cost pres­sure and poor busi­ness prospects de­spite the strong gov­ern­ment sup­port.</p>
    <p>But they recog­nise that re­tain­ing work­ers will keep them bet­ter pre­pared for when de­mand re­cov­ers, said Mr Yap. “As we have man­aged to flat­ten the curve for Covid-19, we should now fo­cus on flat­ten­ing the curve for re­trench­ments, which in­creased to more than 8,000 in the sec­ond quar­ter of 2020,” he added.</p>
    <p>The NWC’s ini­tial an­nual rec­om­men­da­tions in March fo­cused on re­duc­ing non-wage costs first.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy has en­tered a re­ces­sion since then with more slack in the labour mar­ket, noted the coun­cil, which com­prises Mr Seah and 21 other mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Although the guide­lines are not legally bind­ing, the fact that the lead­er­ship of em­ployer groups, unions and the Gov­ern­ment stand be­hind them says some­thing, Mr Seah noted at a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We all gather with one com­mon ob­jec­tive, and if we work well to­gether, we will not only nav­i­gate the cri­sis well but as a coun­try we will also come out stronger. And if our econ­omy emerges stronger, it is good for ev­ery­body,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Wages Coun­cil (NWC) has re­newed its call for em­ploy­ers to im­ple­ment the flex­i­ble wage sys­tem com­pris­ing a fixed ba­sic wage to­gether with monthly and an­nual vari­able com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>It can act as a “shock ab­sorber” in down­turns, said Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Robert Yap, a coun­cil mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“As we go on, there will be ac­tu­ally a lot of shocks, a lot of changes, a lot of other kinds of crises along the way, and if we pre­pare our­selves well with the (flex­i­ble wage sys­tem) prop­erly im­ple­mented, it will help us to cush­ion the im­pact,” he said at a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day on the coun­cil’s up­dated an­nual wage guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Man­power Aubeck Kam said the sys­tem pro­vides em­ploy­ees with some cer­tainty when manag­ing their ex­penses as they know how much could po­ten­tially be ad­justed, while Na­tional Trades Union Congress pres­i­dent Mary Liew stressed that the sys­tem is not just for wage cuts, but also for com­pa­nies to re­ward em­ploy­ees when the com­pa­nies per­form well. Both Mr Kam and Ms Liew are also NWC mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Un­der the sys­tem, the rec­om­mended monthly vari­able com­po­nent for rank-and-file work­ers is 10 per cent, while the an­nual vari­able com­po­nent should be 20 per cent, mak­ing up a to­tal of 30 per cent of the wage pack­age.</p>
    <p>The to­tal vari­able com­po­nent should be 40 per cent for mid­dle man­age­ment and 50 per cent for se­nior man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Last year, only 29.3 per cent of em­ploy­ees were un­der this flex­i­ble wage sys­tem, although in the last few years, about nine in 10 pri­vate­sec­tor em­ploy­ees were in com­pa­nies with some form of flex­i­bil­ity in their pay struc­tures.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem was first in­tro­duced in 1986, af­ter the 1985 re­ces­sion, with an an­nual vari­able com­po­nent, but in 1999, af­ter the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the coun­cil rec­om­mended in­clud­ing a monthly vari­able com­po­nent to al­low busi­nesses to re­act more quickly to chang­ing busi­ness con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The low take-up rate could be due to many multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions fol­low­ing global salary sys­tems, said Mr Alexan­der Melch­ers, an NWC mem­ber and Sin­ga­porean-Ger­man Cham­ber of In­dus­try and Com­merce coun­cil mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Very small busi­nesses mostly do not have hu­man re­source de­part­ments to im­ple­ment changes to wage sys­tems, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Kam noted, though, that it is pos­si­ble for small firms to come on board as HR tech­nol­ogy im­proves.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the NWC rec­om­mended that if wage cuts are nec­es­sary to min­imise re­trench­ments, em­ploy­ers should first ad­just the flex­i­ble por­tions of the wage pack­age.</p>
    <p>Those that have not adopted the flex­i­ble wage sys­tem can cut wages to keep the busi­ness go­ing, but treat any wage cuts as ad­just­ments to a new vari­able com­po­nent and im­me­di­ately im­ple­ment the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Any wage cuts i mple­mented should be fair and rea­son­able, bear­ing in mind that em­ploy­ees will still have ba­sic ex­penses to up­keep,” said the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should also take into ac­count sec­tor and com­pany per­for­mance, gov­ern­ment sup­port and prior cost-saving mea­sures al­ready af­fect­ing em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Mr Melch­ers noted that in rec­om­mend­ing tem­po­rary wage cuts where nec­es­sary, the coun­cil has not cho­sen the eas­i­est path. In some other coun­tries, multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions will j ust cut head­count by say, 30 per cent, to save costs.</p>
    <p>For the first time, the NWC also made rec­om­men­da­tions on sup­port­ing self-em­ployed peo­ple. It said that ser­vice buy­ers and in­ter­me­di­aries should avoid can­celling projects where pos­si­ble, and pro­vide ad­vance or timely par­tial pay­ments for work done or costs in­curred for projects de­ferred or in­ter­rupted by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It said that pre­vi­ously agreed pro­gres­sive wage model in­cre­ments, which set min­i­mum pay lev­els along ca­reer and skills lad­ders in the clean­ing, se­cu­rity and land­scap­ing in­dus­tries, should con­tinue.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil de­cided against a re­duc­tion in em­ploy­ers’ con­tri­bu­tions to the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) as it would dis­pro­por­tion­ately af­fect lo­cal em­ploy­ees, said Mr Kam.</p>
    <p>Cut­ting em­ployer CPF con­tri­bu­tions would also be a blunt move that would not take into ac­count the sig­nif­i­cant vari­a­tion in cir­cum­stances across sec­tors and firms, he added.</p>
