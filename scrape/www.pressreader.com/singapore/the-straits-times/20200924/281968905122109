    <p>• Chi­nese state me­dia has blasted Or­a­cle’s pro­posed deal with the video-shar­ing app TikTok, call­ing the agree­ment ham­mered out un­der pres­sure from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion a “dirty and un­der­handed trick”.</p>
    <p>“What the United States has done to TikTok is al­most the same as a gang­ster forc­ing an un­rea­son­able and un­fair busi­ness deal on a le­git­i­mate com­pany,” the staterun China Daily wrote in an opin­ion piece yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>That came af­ter the Com­mu­nist Party-backed Global Times tabloid called the TikTok deal an “un­palat­able gam­bit” and ac­cused the US of re­sort­ing to “ex­tor­tion” in its ef­forts to com­pel the app’s owner ByteDance to give up con­trol of its US op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“Any sin­gle com­pany is weak on its own,” the Global Times said in an edi­to­rial late on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“But China as a big coun­try will not ac­cept black­mail from the US, nor will it hand over con­trol of an out­stand­ing high-tech Chi­nese com­pany to ex­tor­tion­ists.”</p>
    <p>The tabloid’s ed­i­tor-in-chief Hu Xi­jin tweeted that Bei­jing likely would not ap­prove the cur­rent agree­ment as it en­dan­gered China’s national se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“Re­al­is­ing that ban­ning TikTok in the US mar­ket would not go down well with the mil­lions of young users i n the coun­try,” China Daily wrote, “the ad­min­is­tra­tion then sought to dis­guise its at­tack by or­der­ing the devel­oper ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US com­pany, re­sult­ing in the pro­posed deal be­tween ByteDance and Or­a­cle and Wal­mart.”</p>
    <p>Doubts about the deal for the pop­u­lar app were fu­elled ear­lier this week af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he may not ap­prove it, and China’s government sig­nalled its own hes­i­ta­tion through of­fi­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>US national se­cu­rity of­fi­cials are rais­ing con­cerns that the data of US TikTok users would re­main with a Chi­nese firm, and US of­fi­cials are brac­ing them­selves for Mr Trump to re­ject the deal if it be­comes ob­vi­ous that it does not meet cri­te­ria he him­self laid out pub­licly.</p>
    <p>A com­men­tary car­ried yes­ter­day by the over­seas edi­tion of Peo­ple’s Daily called the deal with TikTok an “Amer­i­can trap”.</p>
    <p>“Un­der the cur­rent agree­ment, this Chi­nese com­pany will def­i­nitely lose its con­trol and core tech­nolo­gies. It is ex­tremely un­fair and will bring se­vere dam­age to China’s national se­cu­rity, dig­nity and rel­e­vant com­pany’s long-term de­vel­op­ment,” the com­men­tary said.</p>
    <p>China Daily’s edi­to­rial re­peated pre­vi­ous claims by Bei­jing that the US is us­ing national se­cu­rity as a pre­text to ban the app.</p>
    <p>“National se­cu­rity has be­come the weapon of choice for Washington when it wants to curb the rise of any com­pa­nies from for­eign coun­tries that are out-per­form­ing their US peers,” it said.</p>
    <p>AMER­I­CAN GANGSTERIS­M</p>
    <p>What the United States has done to TikTok is al­most the same as a gang­ster forc­ing an un­rea­son­able and un­fair busi­ness deal on a le­git­i­mate com­pany.</p>
