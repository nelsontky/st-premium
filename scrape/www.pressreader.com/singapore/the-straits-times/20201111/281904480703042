    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has suf­fered a heavy de­feat i n Par­lia­ment’s Up­per Cham­ber over pro­posed l aws which would al­low him to breach the coun­try’s Euro­pean Union exit treaty – a plan that has been crit­i­cised by United States Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­nal Mar­ket Bill is de­signed to pro­tect trade be­tween the United King­dom’s four na­tions af­ter Brexit.</p>
    <p>It con­tains clauses that min­is­ters say are needed to pro­tect North­ern Ire­land’s del­i­cate sta­tus as part of the United King­dom, but would also break in­ter­na­tional law in a “spe­cific and lim­ited” way.</p>
    <p>The House of Lords voted on Mon­day to strip those clauses from the Bill, in a se­ries of de­feats for the rul­ing Con­ser­va­tive Party.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment does not have a ma­jor­ity in the House of Lords, and even some high-pro­file Con­ser­va­tive mem­bers have op­posed the clauses.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment should see sense, ac­cept the re­moval of these of­fend­ing clauses, and start to re­build our in­ter­na­tional rep­u­ta­tion,” said Ms An­gela Smith, the op­po­si­tion Labour Party’s leader in the Lords.</p>
    <p>Far from back­ing down, how­ever, the gov­ern­ment said it would re-ta­ble the con­tentious clauses when the Bill re­turns to the House of Com­mons, where it had pre­vi­ously passed by 340 votes to 256.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been con­sis­tently clear that the clauses rep­re­sent a le­gal safety net to pro­tect the in­tegrity of the UK’s in­ter­nal mar­ket and the huge gains of the (North­ern Ire­land) peace process,” a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The pub­li­ca­tion of the Bill in Septem­ber pro­voked crit­i­cism, with some say­ing that it would wreck Bri­tain’s in­ter­na­tional stand­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den tweeted on Sept 16 that any­thing which en­dan­gered the peace ac­cord be­tween the Ir­ish Repub­lic and North­ern Ire­land would threaten An­glo-Amer­i­can trade.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son has said the clauses are there to act as a safety net in case on­go­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions with the EU fail to work out how goods can flow be­tween Bri­tain, the Bri­tish province of North­ern Ire­land, and across the open border with EU mem­ber Ire­land.</p>
    <p>Many in­stead view the Bill as a ne­go­ti­at­ing gam­bit to win con­ces­sions from the EU in trade ne­go­ti­a­tions. Brus­sels has al­ready launched le­gal ac­tion against Bri­tain over the pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>“EU can­not rat­ify a new deal while UK is leg­is­lat­ing to break a pre­vi­ous agree­ment. Trust & Good Faith Mat­ters,” Ir­ish For­eign Min­is­ter Si­mon Coveney said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal word­ing of the Bill has to be agreed by both Houses, and typ­i­cally, the un­elected House of Lords does not per­ma­nently block laws sup­ported by the di­rectly elected House of Com­mons.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the clauses may no longer be needed if talks with the EU on how to make the Ir­ish border work are suc­cess­ful.</p>
