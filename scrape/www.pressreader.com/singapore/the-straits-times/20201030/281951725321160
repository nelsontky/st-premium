    <p>TAIPEI • While many places around the world are hit­ting new highs in coro­n­avirus cases, Tai­wan has achieved a dif­fer­ent kind of record – 200 days with­out a lo­cally trans­mit­ted case.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan holds the world’s best virus record by far and reached the new land­mark yes­ter­day, even as the pathogen ex­plodes anew in Europe and the United States.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s last lo­cal case was recorded on April 12; there has been no se­cond wave.</p>
    <p>What did this is­land with 23 mil­lion peo­ple do right? It has had 550 con­firmed Covid-19 cases, with only seven deaths.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say clos­ing bor­ders early and tightly reg­u­lat­ing travel have gone a long way to­wards fight­ing the virus. Other fac­tors in­clude rig­or­ous con­tact trac­ing, tech­nol­o­gyen­forced quar­an­tine and uni­ver­sal mask wear­ing.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, Tai­wan’s deadly ex­pe­ri­ence with Sars in 2003 has scared peo­ple into com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan is the only ma­jor econ­omy that has so far been able to keep com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 elim­i­nated, said Dr Peter Col­lignon, an in­fec­tious dis­ease physi­cian and pro­fes­sor at the Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity Med­i­cal School.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan “prob­a­bly had the best re­sult around the world”, he said, and it is “even more im­pres­sive” for an econ­omy with a pop­u­la­tion about the same size as Aus­tralia’s, with many peo­ple liv­ing close to one an­other in apart­ments.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan will also be among the few economies to reg­is­ter growth this year, with the gov­ern­ment in Au­gust fore­cast­ing that the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct will ex­pand 1.56 per cent in 2020.</p>
    <p>Still, Tai­wan is not out of the woods yet, as it recorded 20 im­ported cases in the past two weeks, mostly from South-east Asian coun­tries such as the Philip­pines and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>And oth­ers that ini­tially fought the virus well, like Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan, then had spikes in cases.</p>
    <p>What coun­tries with surg­ing in­fec­tions can take away from Tai­wan’s ex­pe­ri­ence is that noth­ing works with­out con­tact trac­ing those who have tested pos­i­tive and then quar­an­tin­ing them, said Dr</p>
    <p>Chen Chien-jen, the is­land’s for­mer vice-pres­i­dent and an epi­demi­ol­o­gist, in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Also, as it is not easy to make peo­ple stay in quar­an­tine, Tai­wan has taken steps to pro­vide meal and gro­cery de­liv­ery and even some friendly con­tact via Line Bot, a ro­bot that texts and chats.</p>
    <p>There is also pun­ish­ment – those who break quar­an­tine face fines of up to NT$1 mil­lion (S$48,560).</p>
    <p>Here is how Tai­wan has achieved its mile­stone:</p>
    <p>1 BOR­DER CON­TROL</p>
    <p>Tai­wan shut down to all non-res­i­dents shortly af­ter the pan­demic broke out in Jan­uary and has kept tight con­trol over its bor­ders since.</p>
    <p>“Tai­wan’s continual suc­cess is due to strict en­force­ment of bor­der con­trol,” said Dr Ja­son Wang, the di­rec­tor of Stan­ford Univer­sity’s Cen­tre for Pol­icy, Out­comes and Pre­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>That in­cludes symp­tom-based sur­veil­lance be­fore trav­ellers board flights and dig­i­tal fence track­ing via cel­lu­lar sig­nals to en­sure their com­pli­ance with a 14-day quar­an­tine, he said.</p>
    <p>2 MASKS, DIS­TRI­BU­TION</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to stock­pile and have cen­tral dis­tri­bu­tion of face masks played a key role in Tai­wan’s suc­cess.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment early in the pan­demic stock­piled all do­mes­ti­cally pro­duced face masks and banned their ex­port.</p>
    <p>Within four months, com­pa­nies in­creased pro­duc­tion from two mil­lion to 20 mil­lion units a day, en­abling the is­land to ra­tion masks to res­i­dents on a reg­u­lar ba­sis.</p>
    <p>3 CON­TACT TRAC­ING, QUAR­AN­TINE</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has world-class con­tact trac­ing – on av­er­age, link­ing 20 to 30 con­tacts to each con­firmed case.</p>
    <p>In ex­treme sit­u­a­tions, such as that of a worker at a Taipei City host­ess club who con­tracted the virus, the gov­ern­ment tracked down as many as 150 con­tacts.</p>
    <p>Then, all con­tacts must un­dergo a 14-day home quar­an­tine, even if they test neg­a­tive. So far, about 340,000 peo­ple have been un­der home quar­an­tine, with fewer than 1,000 fined for break­ing it.</p>
    <p>That means 99.7 per cent have com­plied, ac­cord­ing to Dr Chen.</p>
    <p>“We sac­ri­ficed 14 days of 340,000 peo­ple in ex­change for nor­mal lives for 23 mil­lion peo­ple,” Dr Chen said.</p>

So far, about 340,000 peo­ple have been un­der home quar­an­tine, with fewer than 1,000 fined for break­ing it.</p>
    <p>4 SARS EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>The painful lessons of past epi­demics paved the way of Tai­wan’s suc­cess in fight­ing Covid.</p>
    <p>It be­gan build­ing an emer­gency re­sponse net­work for con­tain­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases af­ter its ex­pe­ri­ence with Sars in 2003, when hun­dreds be­came ill and at least 73 died, for the world’s third-high­est in­fec­tion rate. Tai­wan later ex­pe­ri­enced pan­demics such as bird flu and in­fluenza H1N1.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, its res­i­dents are acutely aware of dis­ease-fight­ing habits such as hand-wash­ing and wear­ing of masks.</p>
