    <p>The case cen­tred on the role that se­nior lawyer Lee Suet Fern played in pre­par­ing and ex­e­cut­ing found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew’s last will signed on Dec 17, 2013.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary last year, the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) re­ferred a case of pos­si­ble pro­fes­sional mis­con­duct in­volv­ing Mrs Lee to Sin­ga­pore’s Law So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The AGC noted that Mrs Lee ap­peared to have pre­pared the last will of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew and ar­ranged for him to ex­e­cute it de­spite the fact that her hus­band, Mr Lee Hsien Yang, was a ben­e­fi­ciary and had his share of the es­tate in­creased un­der the last will.</p>
    <p>The case was later re­ferred to a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal ap­pointed by Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, com­pris­ing Se­nior Coun­sel Sar­jit Singh Gill and lawyer Leon Yee Kee Shian. The tri­bunal found Mrs Lee guilty of grossly im­proper pro­fes­sional con­duct in her han­dling of her fa­ther-in-law’s will.</p>
    <p>It said in its 206-page grounds of de­ci­sion that the facts ex­posed an “un­savoury tale” of how Mrs Lee and her hus­band had mis­led the se­nior Mr Lee to sign a new will with­out the ad­vice of his usual lawyer, Ms Kwa Kim Li, who had pre­pared all six of his pre­vi­ous wills.</p>
    <p>The se­nior Mr Lee, who died on March 23, 2015, was then aged 90 and in poor health.</p>
    <p>The tri­bunal held that Mrs Lee had acted as Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s lawyer as she was the only lawyer re­spon­si­ble for the last will af­ter Mr Lee Hsien Yang cut Ms Kwa out by not in­clud­ing her in an e-mail thread urg­ing his fa­ther to pro­ceed with the ex­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lee her­self had told the AGC in De­cem­ber 2018 that her fatherin-law had given her in­struc­tions to have his last will en­grossed, or fi­nalised, the tri­bunal noted.</p>
    <p>This was also Mr Lee Hsien Yang’s po­si­tion in a let­ter to a min­is­te­rial com­mit­tee set up to look into op­tions for his fa­ther’s Ox­ley Road house.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mrs Lee later changed her po­si­tion in her af­fi­davit.</p>
    <p>She ini­tially did not deny draft­ing the will but later said her hus­band had for­warded the draft will to her, even though nei­ther of them could pro­duce the e-mails to prove this.</p>
    <p>In act­ing as Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s lawyer, she failed to ad­vance his in­ter­est un­af­fected by that of her or her hus­band, the tri­bunal found.</p>
    <p>It de­scribed Mrs Lee as a “de­ceit­ful wit­ness who tai­lored her ev­i­dence to por­tray her­self as an in­no­cent vic­tim who had been ma­ligned”, adding that her hus­band’s con­duct was “equally de­ceit­ful”.</p>
    <p>The mat­ter was then re­ferred to a Court of Three Judges, the high­est dis­ci­plinary body for pro­fes­sional mis­con­duct among lawyers.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the court re­served judg­ment af­ter a vir­tual hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the hear­ing, the Law So­ci­ety, rep­re­sented by lawyer Koh Swee Yen, had ar­gued that Mrs Lee had been in­volved in the will de­spite know­ing her hus­band stood to gain from it.</p>
    <p>It also said that the lawyer of 37 years had hur­ried her fatherin-law through the process of sign­ing it with­out the ad­vice of his usual lawyer.</p>
    <p>Coun­ter­ing the Law So­ci­ety’s ar­gu­ments, Se­nior Coun­sel Ken­neth Tan and Pro­fes­sor Wal­ter Woon, a for­mer at­tor­ney-gen­eral, said Mrs Lee was act­ing out of af­fec­tion and con­cern as a daugh­ter-in-law in as­sist­ing Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and was merely per­form­ing an ad­min­is­tra­tive role.</p>
    <p>They added that there could not have been any con­flict of in­ter­est be­cause Mr Lee Kuan Yew, “a bril­liant lawyer”, was fully aware of what he wanted and had con­sented to Mrs Lee han­dling the will for him. They called for all charges to be dropped.</p>
