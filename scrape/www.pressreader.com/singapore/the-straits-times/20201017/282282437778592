    <p>Trainer Cliff Brown has a strong hand in to­day’s penul­ti­mate event at Kranji, the $50,000 Class 4 race over 1,600m on turf.</p>
    <p>He will be rep­re­sented by three smart run­ners in the 12-horse field, namely top­weight Cen­te­nary Di­a­mond, back-to-back win­ner In All His Glory and three-time win­ner Mag­nif­i­cent Gold.</p>
    <p>Although In All His Glory has yet to race over 1,600m, he is the trainer’s ace in the pack. The fouryear-old ch­est­nut geld­ing is ooz­ing with form, hav­ing won his last two starts con­vinc­ingly over 1,400m.</p>
    <p>Cen­te­nary Di­a­mond scored all his three wins over 1,600m. Two of Mag­nif­i­cent Gold’s suc­cesses were over the same dis­tance.</p>
    <p>The Tarn­pirr Sta­ble-owned In All His Glory opened his ac­count with an easy win in a Re­stricted Maiden race over 1,400m un­der three-time</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cham­pion Vlad Duric on Sept 5.</p>
    <p>He then fol­lowed up with another strong on-pace win in a Class 4 race over the same trip at his last start three weeks later when rid­den by Azhar Is­mail. This led Brown to be­lieve that his charge could han­dle the ex­tra 200m.</p>
    <p>“Yes, he has given ev­ery in­di­ca­tion that he could run up to the mile,” said the Aus­tralian, who is fourth on the pre­mier­ship with 26 win­ners.</p>
    <p>“From bar­rier No. 6, he will go for­ward – ei­ther try to lead or run in sec­ond be­hind the leader.</p>
    <p>“He worked well, is nice and fit, and has Duric on him again. You never know un­til they run.”</p>
    <p>Brown is a lit­tle con­cerned about Cen­te­nary Di­a­mond hav­ing to give weight all round in what looks like an open race, which in­cludes last­start win­ners Iron champ and Shep­herd’s Hymn.</p>
    <p>His charge is car­ry­ing 58.5kg. But he reck­ons the horse is well and will be rid­den by dual Group 1-win­ning jockey Ruan Maia.</p>
    <p>“He car­ries a bit of weight now, but he’s good and I have Maia. He has a good rider on him, so he should be well.</p>
    <p>“Mag­nif­i­cent Gold was un­lucky lately. He is first-up, is nice and bright, and he worked well, too. I can­not fault him.”</p>
    <p>Owned by the Gold Sta­ble, Mag­nif­i­cent Gold’s last race was on Aug 23, when he ran on fourth to Meryl. Meryl is also in to­day’s race.</p>
    <p>Mag­nif­i­cent Gold will be rid­den for the first time by Juan Paul van der Merwe. He will jump from bar­rier 8.</p>
    <p>Cen­te­nary Di­a­mond has drawn Gate 4. The five-year-old bay geld­ing has been nom­i­nated for the third leg of the Sin­ga­pore Triple Crown Se­ries, the $1 mil­lion Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Gold Cup over 2,000m on Nov 21, along­side sta­ble­mates Gold Strike (run­ner-up last year), Trumpy, Three and fourpence and Elite In­cred­i­ble.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 40 nom­i­nees were re­vealed in the first-round of en­tries for the Gold Cup, with the Mark Walker-trained Count of mon­te­cris to top­ping the list on 115 points.</p>
    <p>Cen­te­nary Di­a­mond is the low­est-rated of Brown’s en­tries on 66 points. He is 33rd on the list.</p>
    <p>His odds of se­cur­ing a place in the 16-run­ner field are low, but the world of rac­ing can be full of sur­prises.</p>
    <p>“I think he can get the trip. Well, you never know, right?” said Brown, who cap­tured the Gold Cup with the late Gilt Com­plex in 2017.</p>
