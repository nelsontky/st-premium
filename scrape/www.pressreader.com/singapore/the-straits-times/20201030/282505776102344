    <p>SEOUL • Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics warned yes­ter­day that earn­ings in the cur­rent quar­ter will de­cline, say­ing the strong growth in its mo­bile and me­mory busi­ness that helped third-quar­ter profit beat fore­casts will ease amid in­ten­si­fy­ing com­pe­ti­tion and weak­en­ing de­mand.</p>
    <p>The world’s largest maker of me­mory chips and per­sonal elec­tron­ics said net in­come rose a bet­ter-than-ex­pected 52 per cent to 9.27 tril­lion won (S$11.2 bil­lion) in the three months ended last month, beat­ing the 7.54 tril­lion won av­er­age of es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>It fore­sees cap­i­tal spend­ing of about 35.2 tril­lion won this year be­cause of a mi­gra­tion to more ad­vanced chip pro­cesses and a build­out of its con­tract chip­mak­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The South Korean tech­nol­ogy gi­ant’s tepid out­look may fuel con­cern that the re­mark­able tech sec­tor rally dur­ing the pan­demic may have run its course.</p>
    <p>The firm joined fel­low chip­mak­ers Mi­cron Tech­nol­ogy and In­tel in warn­ing that de­mand from server cus­tomers will weaken amid an in­ven­tory cor­rec­tion. Sam­sung also fore­cast ris­ing com­pe­ti­tion in mo­bile phones and con­sumer elec­tron­ics and said it will have to boost spend­ing on mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>“Con­cerns over dis­rup­tions in sup­ply chain drove chip de­mand from cloud op­er­a­tors early this year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, but the de­mand cooled down as in­ven­to­ries kept ris­ing,” said Cape In­vest­ment & Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Park Sung-soon. “We are see­ing a cor­rec­tion in the me­mory chip mar­ket in Q4 but me­mory chip prices are ex­pected to rise next year when hy­per­scalers start ex­pand­ing their in­vest­ment in servers.”</p>
    <p>Sam­sung shares have surged nearly 40 per cent from their March lows. The stock slipped as much as 2.4 per cent yes­ter­day af­ter the earn­ings re­port, the most in more than a month.</p>
    <p>Sales of Sam­sung smart­phones jumped nearly 50 per cent dur­ing the Septem­ber quar­ter as the roll­out of its lat­est Gal­axy Note series and a new fold­able de­vice reignited de­mand for premium hand­sets that had flagged dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Phone ship­ments to­talled 88 mil­lion units, while tablet PCs reached nine mil­lion dur­ing the pe­riod, ac­cord­ing to the com­pany, which is seek­ing to re­gain the lead as the world’s largest smart­phone maker af­ter los­ing the crown ear­lier this year to Huawei.</p>
    <p>“In con­sumer elec­tron­ics, prof­itabil­ity is ex­pected to weaken on grow­ing com­pe­ti­tion and ris­ing costs, de­spite solid de­mand,” Sam­sung said in the earn­ings re­lease.</p>
    <p>“For 2021, the com­pany ex­pects a re­cov­ery in over­all global de­mand but un­cer­tain­ties will re­main over the pos­si­bil­ity of re­cur­ring epi­demic waves of Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>The death of Sam­sung Group chair­man Lee Kun-hee over the week­end may add to un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>While his son Lee Jae-yong is ex­pected to take over as chair­man of the group, the younger Lee still faces two tri­als over al­le­ga­tions he used bribery and ac­count­ing trick­ery to smooth his path to suc­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily will also have to pay bil­lions of dol­lars in in­her­i­tance tax, and Sam­sung has so far de­clined to com­ment on how they will fund the pay­ments.</p>
