    <p>Ten­sions ran high this month be­tween the US and China, par­tic­u­larly over Hong Kong and the South China Sea. Sum­ming up the re­lent­less rhythm of sanc­tions and counter-sanc­tions, ac­ri­mo­nious ac­cu­sa­tions and re­cip­ro­cal words, China’s For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi said re­la­tions were at their low­est in 40 years, while US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he had no in­ter­est in talk­ing to Bei­jing about trade. The re­la­tion­ship is likely to sour even fur­ther, as the US weighs even stricter bans and sanc­tions. The fol­low­ing are the key de­vel­op­ments since the be­gin­ning of July. WED­NES­DAY, JULY 1</p>
    <p>The US Congress passes the Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act, which sanc­tions Chi­nese in­di­vid­u­als and banks re­spon­si­ble for un­der­min­ing Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy, fol­low­ing China’s pas­sage of a na­tional security law for Hong Kong a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>China be­gins five days of mil­i­tary ex­er­cises around the South China Sea’s Para­cel Is­lands, which Viet­nam also claims.</p>
    <p>The US Pen­tagon ex­presses its con­cerns in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Four US agen­cies warn Amer­i­can com­pa­nies that they face le­gal risks and harm to their rep­u­ta­tion if they have sup­ply chain links with en­ti­ties in China guilty of hu­man rights abuses, in­clud­ing the forced labour of Uighur Mus­lims in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>China or­ders four US me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions – The As­so­ci­ated Press, United Press In­ter­na­tional, CBS and Na­tional Pub­lic Ra­dio – to sub­mit de­tails of their op­er­a­tions in the coun­try as re­tal­i­a­tion for the US clas­si­fy­ing four ma­jor Chi­nese state me­dia out­lets as for­eign em­bassies.</p>
    <p>SUN­DAY, JULY 5</p>
    <p>The US de­ploys two air­craft car­ri­ers to the South China Sea as China’s own naval ex­er­cises in the con­tested wa­ters are on­go­ing. A Navy of­fi­cial de­scribes the mis­sion as a rou­tine op­er­a­tion, but an­a­lysts call it a sig­nif­i­cant show of force.</p>
    <p>MON­DAY, JULY 6</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo says the US is con­sid­er­ing ban­ning TikTok, a so­cial me­dia app owned by Chi­nese tech gi­ant ByteDance but pop­u­lar among Amer­i­can teenagers, over per­sonal data security con­cerns.</p>
    <p>THURS­DAY, JULY 9</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi gives a ma­jor speech out­lin­ing ways to mend frayed US-China ties, ac­knowl­edg­ing that the bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship is at its low­est since 1979.</p>
    <p>He says China has no in­ter­est in re­plac­ing the United States, and that US hawks were por­tray­ing China as an en­emy.</p>
    <p>The US sanc­tions se­nior Chi­nese of­fi­cials over al­leged hu­man rights abuses against Uighur Mus­lims in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>MON­DAY, JULY 13</p>
    <p>The US for­mally re­jects most of China’s South China Sea claims as un­law­ful, in a pol­icy shift that backs an in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tral tri­bunal’s 2016 rul­ing of the claims as il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo slams China’s “cam­paign of bul­ly­ing” South-east Asian na­tions to gain con­trol of off­shore re­sources.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing con­demns the state­ment as an at­tempt to sow dis­cord be­tween China and other coastal states in the re­gion.</p>
