    <p>Re­gard­less of the cri­sis or chal­lenge fac­ing the na­tion, Par­lia­ment re­mains com­mit­ted to up­hold­ing the demo­cratic process of hold­ing the Gov­ern­ment of the day ac­count­able to Sin­ga­pore­ans, Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Call­ing on MPs to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore’s laws and reg­u­la­tions are rig­or­ously re­viewed and up­dated, es­pe­cially to keep pace with the changes wrought by Covid-19, he promised to fa­cil­i­tate this by en­sur­ing that more view­points are heard and ex­am­ined in his role as neu­tral ob­server of Par­lia­ment’s de­bates.</p>
    <p>“While the Gov­ern­ment steers us through these un­charted wa­ters in the com­ing months, and per­haps years, it is more vi­tal than ever that Sin­ga­pore­ans are con­fi­dent that Par­lia­ment will re­main a stead­fast and vig­i­lant bea­con in our role as the na­tion’s prin­ci­pal law­mak­ing body,” he said in a post on the Speaker’s Blog ahead of the open­ing of Par­lia­ment to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing the de­bates on the sup­ple­men­tary Bud­gets and other Covid-19-re­lated Bills dur­ing the last term of Par­lia­ment, Mr Tan said every is­sue was thor­oughly parsed and un­packed by MPs, who had pas­sion­ately put forth their po­si­tions and sought clar­i­fi­ca­tions on mat­ters rang­ing from how much of the re­serves should be tapped to the im­pact of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“There was a mul­ti­tude of di­verse per­spec­tives, with many MPs – be it from the gov­ern­ing or the op­po­si­tion bench – com­mend­ably rais­ing the per­ti­nent is­sues and ques­tions that our cit­i­zens were seized by, even if these were ar­guably con­tentious.</p>
    <p>“I firmly be­lieve that this rigour of scru­tiny in Par­lia­ment has led to bet­ter and more re­fined poli­cies and ini­tia­tives for all stake­hold­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also noted that even when there were dis­agree­ments or dif­fer­ences of opin­ion, MPs had ex­pressed them in a re­spon­si­ble and re­spect­ful man­ner, and in ac­cor­dance with the deco­rum of the House.</p>
    <p>Some­times, these di­vi­sions and dis­agree­ments are what peo­ple fo­cus on as they make for “more dra­matic head­lines and click­bait fod­der on so­cial me­dia”, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>But he re­minded MPs that no mat­ter which side of the aisle they were on and what party colours they wear, “all of us form an im­por­tant thread in strength­en­ing the very fab­ric of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said that with some changes in Par­lia­ment, such as</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh be­ing for­mally des­ig­nated Leader of the Op­po­si­tion and the ad­di­tion of 31 newly elected MPs, there will be more per­spec­tives shared.</p>
    <p>He pledged to do his best to fa­cil­i­tate ro­bust de­bate: “If re-elected, my ap­proach as Speaker will re­main be­ing per­mis­sive and ex­pan­sive where I can within the Stand­ing Or­ders, so that as many view­points and in­sights can be delved into.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, it would be good to keep the tone sen­si­ble, but I</p>
