    <p>Thai­land’s youth­ful anti-govern­ment pro­test­ers out­smarted po­lice early last Fri­day evening by switch­ing their gath­er­ing point at the last minute.</p>
    <p>In the end, though, the po­lice got the last laugh when they cleared Bangkok’s Pathumwan in­ter­sec­tion by blast­ing pro­test­ers with sting­ing jets of water and send­ing in of­fi­cers with riot gear to push back crowds of um­brella-tot­ing demon­stra­tors.</p>
    <p>This marked an es­ca­la­tion of the stu­dent-led protest move­ment that was erst­while on a slow burn.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say this crack­down may slow the protest move­ment, which has both chal­lenged the mil­i­tary-led govern­ment as well as raised un­com­fort­able ques­tions about the role of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, but will also likely har­den the re­solve of pro­test­ers and nar­row the chances of a po­lit­i­cal res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“This will gen­er­ate fear,” said Dr Ti­tipol Phakdee­wanich, the dean of Ubon Ratchathan­i Univer­sity’s po­lit­i­cal sci­ence fac­ulty. “It might work to slow down the move­ment, but I don’t think it will stop.”</p>
    <p>Dr Stithorn Thananithi­chot, a po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist at King Pra­jad­hipok’s In­sti­tute, ex­pects the po­lice ac­tion to di­min­ish the le­git­i­macy of Prime Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Prayut Chan-o-cha’s govern­ment, even though he will be able to stay on by dint of the ma­jor­ity held by his coali­tion.</p>
    <p>The former coup leader, try­ing to save a tourism-de­pen­dent econ­omy sink­ing from border clo­sures due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, took a hard­line stance ear­lier last Fri­day when he warned peo­ple not to vi­o­late the law.</p>
    <p>It was a law en­acted by the govern­ment overnight in Bangkok, via a Thurs­day morn­ing dec­la­ra­tion of “se­ri­ous emer­gency”, which for­bade gath­er­ings of five or more peo­ple and gave se­cu­rity of­fi­cers broad pow­ers to search and de­tain in­di­vid­u­als, as well as cen­sor news.</p>
    <p>In a sense, said Dr Stithorn, the po­lice were forced to act on pro­test­ers. “They have no choice be­cause it says in the emer­gency law that this is their duty.”</p>
    <p>Govern­ment spokesman Anucha Bu­ra­pachaisri, quot­ing Mr Prayut af­ter last Fri­day’s crack­down, said the en­force­ment was in line with in­ter­na­tional con­ven­tions and nec­es­sary to fore­stall in­ter­fer­ence from third par­ties try­ing to in­sti­gate vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>King Va­ji­ra­longkorn, who has not pub­licly com­mented di­rectly on the protests, ap­peared on tele­vi­sion last Fri­day say­ing “the coun­try needs peo­ple who love the coun­try and love the monar­chy”.</p>
    <p>These were pre-recorded com­ments from an event held last Thurs­day, when he was ad­dress­ing a group of former com­mu­nists in north­ern Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“All your ex­pe­ri­ence and the things that you’ve done – you can teach the new gen­er­a­tion of your ex­pe­ri­ence. This will be greatly use­ful,” he told them, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters re­port.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers sug­gested that such com­ments may rouse more roy­al­ists to con­front the pro­test­ers, who have been openly call­ing for the King, who con­trols two army units, to trim his ex­pen­di­ture as well as power, in keep­ing with Thai­land’s sta­tus as a con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy.</p>
    <p>This un­easy pos­si­bil­ity was sighted last Thurs­day, when hard­core roy­al­ist fig­ures such as former monk Suwit Thong­prasert and fiery former law­maker Suthep Thaug­suban mus­tered sup­port­ers along the route where the King’s con­voy was due to pass pro­test­ers who had vowed to flash a three-fin­ger salute at the monarch in de­fi­ance.</p>
    <p>Mr Harrison Cheng, the Sin­ga­pore-based as­so­ciate direc­tor of Con­trol Risks con­sul­tancy, said in an anal­y­sis note re­leased be­fore the protest last Fri­day: “Rogue ele­ments of the ‘yel­low shirt’ move­ment could repli­cate their tac­tics of old, in­clud­ing stag­ing se­cu­rity in­ci­dents at protest sites with the aim of cre­at­ing more pub­lic dis­or­der and giv­ing the po­lice and mil­i­tary a pre­text to in­ter­vene.”</p>
    <p>He added: “As risks of street vi­o­lence grow, so will the po­ten­tial for the reim­po­si­tion of mil­i­tary rule in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Flash mobs broke out in Khon Kaen, Pathum Thani and Hat Yai last Fri­day in protest against the de­ploy­ment of water can­non.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a call by pro­test­ers to muster sup­port­ers at sky­train sta­tions prompted the au­thor­i­ties to shut down the en­tire elec­tric rail net­work serv­ing cen­tral Bangkok.</p>
    <p>With po­si­tions hard­en­ing on both sides, the only way out would be to start the process of amend­ing the mil­i­tary-backed Con­sti­tu­tion – one of the de­mands made by pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>“In the end, the govern­ment has to open the door for some res­o­lu­tion and to make some changes to the Con­sti­tu­tion,” said Dr Stithorn. It may be the only way to keep the govern­ment and monar­chy se­cure, he said.</p>
