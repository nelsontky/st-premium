    <p>but in a pe­cu­liar­ity of the Amer­i­can sys­tem, Mr Trump, be­cause of nar­row wins in just a hand­ful of key Mid­west­ern states, was able to win the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den drew wide praise across the board for his Thurs­day night ac­cep­tance speech, which was more a fire­side chat than thun­der­ous ora­tion, cit­ing from African Amer­i­can civil rights ac­tivist Ella Baker (“I’ll be an ally of the light, not the dark­ness”).</p>
    <p>The for­mat may have suited Mr Bi­den, who is be­ing at­tacked by Pres­i­dent Trump for cog­ni­tive de­cline; at 77, he is three years older than the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Even Fox News con­trib­u­tor Dana Perino, who for two years was Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush’s press sec­re­tary, said it was the best speech of Mr Bi­den’s life.</p>
    <p>“He just took the mo­ment,” she said on Thurs­day night.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, and the party, de­liv­ered the mes­sage, Mr Mark Penn, a for­mer ad­viser to the Clin­tons, said on Fox Busi­ness the morn­ing af­ter. “They kept the party to­gether, they had a con­ven­tion that was al­most flaw­less and, most im­por­tantly, Joe Bi­den the can­di­date was able to de­liver the speech against very low ex­pec­ta­tions.”</p>
    <p>In clos­ing, Mr Bi­den made a pow­er­ful ap­peal be­yond the party’s base. “While I will be a Demo­cratic can­di­date, I will be an Amer­i­can pres­i­dent,” he said. “I will work as hard for those who didn’t sup­port me as I will for those who did.</p>
    <p>“That’s the job of a pres­i­dent,” he said. “This is not a par­ti­san mo­ment. This must be an Amer­i­can mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, rep­re­sent­ing the re­al­ity of a changed – and chang­ing – Amer­ica was Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris, the first woman of colour to be nom­i­nated to such a high of­fice and, given Mr Bi­den’s age, very ob­vi­ously the heir ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>The 55-year-old sen­a­tor, born of im­mi­grant par­ents from In­dia and Ja­maica, is a bridge, so to speak, be­tween the old es­tab­lish­ment and the younger, fiery so­cial­ist pro­gres­sives like New York Con­gress­woman Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez – a Bernie San­ders pro­tege who has caught the imag­i­na­tion of the pro­gres­sive wing of the party.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage of the DNC was an Amer­ica that is di­verse, plu­ral and pro­gres­sive.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has been con­sis­tently lead­ing Pres­i­dent Trump in the polls, though with vari­a­tions.</p>
    <p>In Min­nesota, the cur­rent gap is within the mar­gin of er­ror.</p>
    <p>Whether the DNC will trans­late into a mean­ing­ful “bounce” in the polls and whether that will be sus­tained re­mains to be seen in a re­morse­lessly po­larised coun­try.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump, vis­it­ing Mr Bi­den’s home town of Scran­ton, Penn­syl­va­nia, on Thurs­day, sniped re­lent­lessly at his ri­val.</p>
    <p>Democrats are con­cerned that few peo­ple will turn up to vote, he said on Twit­ter. “They are try­ing to STEAL this elec­tion. This should not be al­lowed!” he added.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, on the third night of the DNC, for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama blasted Mr Trump, say­ing: “This ad­min­is­tra­tion has shown it will tear our democ­racy down if that’s what it takes to win. So we have to get busy... by pour­ing all our ef­fort into these 76 days, and by vot­ing like never be­fore.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is per­haps the first pres­i­dent in Amer­i­can his­tory to con­sciously and overtly call into ques­tion the in­tegrity of Amer­i­can elec­tions, in­di­cat­ing that the only way he can lose is if the elec­tion is rigged, Cor­nell Uni­ver­sity’s pro­fes­sor of Amer­i­can Stud­ies</p>
    <p>Glenn Altschuler told The Straits Times. “If there is a le­git­i­mate cause to be ex­tremely ap­pre­hen­sive about the state of Amer­i­can democ­racy, that’s the cause,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But there is no ques­tion that the Democrats are far more uni­fied in 2020 than they were in 2016 – and en­thu­si­as­ti­cally so, be­hind Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“And ob­vi­ously the rea­son for that is Don­ald Trump and the threat per­ceived from Don­ald Trump.”</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sent­ing the re­al­ity of a changed – and chang­ing – Amer­ica was Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris, the first woman of colour to be nom­i­nated to such a high of­fice and, given Mr Bi­den’s age, very ob­vi­ously the heir ap­par­ent... The mes­sage ... was an Amer­ica that is di­verse, plu­ral and pro­gres­sive.</p>
