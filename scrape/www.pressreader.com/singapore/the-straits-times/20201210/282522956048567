    <p>The lead cou­ple of new ro­man­tic com­edy Ad­ven­ture Of The Ring caused a mi­nor stir when they filmed a kiss­ing scene at a real-life base­ball game in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The live au­di­ence was caught by sur­prise when the smooch be­tween Tai­wanese stars Chris Wang and Allison Lin was shown on the sta­dium’s big-screen “kiss cam” dur­ing a break in the match.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­gional me­dia in a video con­fer­ence, Lin (The World Be­tween Us, 2019), 35, says: “I got mes­sages af­ter the scene was filmed. Peo­ple sent me links to ar­ti­cles say­ing our kiss made it to sports head­lines.</p>
    <p>“I got re­ally ner­vous be­cause Chris is a mar­ried man. I don’t want peo­ple to think I was kiss­ing him in real life. Thank­fully, many ne­ti­zens pointed out that we must have been film­ing as there’s no way celebri­ties would cheat so openly.”</p>
    <p>Wang, 38, is mar­ried to his former man­ager and the cou­ple have two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>He says: “I had a bit of a prankster’s mind­set go­ing into the scene. Af­ter our kiss cam was shown, I ob­served the re­ac­tion of the au­di­ence and they were look­ing around try­ing to find out where we were seated.”</p>
    <p>Ad­ven­ture Of The Ring, an HBO Asia orig­i­nal, fol­lows the story of a log­i­cal, level-headed ac­tu­ary Yizhi (Wang), who is about to pro­pose to his free-spir­ited flight-attendant girl­friend Lisa (Lin). His plans go awry when he mis­places his ring on a train.</p>
    <p>The se­ries, which pre­mieres on Sun­day on HBO and HBO Go, is adapted from a novel ti­tled Ring Of The Day.</p>
    <p>This is Wang’s first lead­ing role in five years. The ac­tor-host, known for host­ing travel va­ri­ety se­ries and star­ring in the pop­u­lar drama The Shrewd Wife (2010), took time off act­ing af­ter his daugh­ter was born in 2015.</p>
    <p>His other child, a boy, was born in 2017.</p>
    <p>“I could not sleep the day be­fore we started film­ing be­cause it’s been so long since I’ve had a lead­ing role,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>“I had to work harder for this than for my pre­vi­ous roles be­cause I had to catch up and warm up again.”</p>
    <p>For Lin, who was a flight attendant be­fore mov­ing to act­ing full­time, she felt at home in the role.</p>
    <p>“The mo­ment I stepped onto the plane set, the cabin crew in me took over. I be­came de­tail</p>
    <p>ori­ented and was check­ing the coun­ters to see if they were clean, if the bread bas­kets were in the proper po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tress also shares a num­ber of sim­i­lar­i­ties with her out­go­ing, im­pul­sive char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>She says: “Lisa and I are sim­i­lar in the sense that we’re both quite im­pul­sive in love. We both take ac­tion once we re­alise we want some­thing.”</p>
    <p>Wang, how­ever, is “al­most en­tirely op­po­site” of his calm, log­i­cal char­ac­ter, who is not prone to flights of fan­cies.</p>
    <p>In real life, he can be im­pul­sive – he sold his house and moved his fam­ily of four into a camper’s van to travel around Tai­wan this year.</p>
    <p>He says their no­madic life­style will con­tinue for a while more. “Travel is not meant to be for­ever. We’ll prob­a­bly keep do­ing this un­til my daugh­ter goes to pri­mary school next July.”</p>
    <p>He and his co-star, who were chummy and chatty with each other dur­ing the in­ter­view, shared mem­o­rable times dur­ing film­ing.</p>
    <p>Wang’s char­ac­ter gets drunk in one scene and throws up.</p>
    <p>Lin re­counts with a laugh: “Dur­ing that scene, he was re­ally let­ting loose and giv­ing it his all. And I was feel­ing a lit­tle bit like, ‘Oh man, he’s suck­ing up all the spot­light.’”</p>
    <p>Wang says his wife shied away from vis­it­ing on set when he was due to film with Lin.</p>
    <p>“She didn’t want to af­fect Allison’s emo­tions by be­ing there and mak­ing it hard for her to imag­ine me as her fi­ance.”</p>
    <p>Caught by sur­prise at this rev­e­la­tion, Lin says: “That’s re­ally sweet of her.”</p>
    <p>Ad­ven­ture Of The Ring pre­mieres on Sun­day at 9pm on HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420) and HBO Go.</p>
