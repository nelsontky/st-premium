    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • There were six teams in con­tention last week for the eighth and fi­nal play-off spot in the Western Con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>That num­ber was whit­tled down to four on Sun­day af­ter the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans and Sacra­mento Kings were elim­i­nated.</p>
    <p>The tus­sle among the Mem­phis Griz­zlies, Port­land Trail Blaz­ers, San An­to­nio Spurs and Phoenix Suns for the last re­main­ing post­sea­son berth in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) re­mains con­vo­luted, with only two reg­u­larsea­son games re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>Even LeBron James, whose Los An­ge­les Lak­ers team will play the eighth seed, has given up fol­low­ing the twists and turns. He said: “I’m not pay­ing at­ten­tion to what’s going on with the eighth seed right now, be­cause there’s too much that can hap­pen with play-in games to de­cide that. It’s too far away.”</p>
    <p>What is guar­an­teed is there will be a best-of-two se­ries, with the eighth seed need­ing to win one game to ad­vance to the play-offs af­ter the Griz­zlies lost to Toronto Rap­tors 108-99 at Dis­ney World on Sun­day, giv­ing the league cham­pi­ons sec­ond seed­ing in the East. The eighth- and ninth-placed teams must play each other in a play-in game on Saturday be­cause the ad­van­tage is less than four games.</p>
    <p>If the eighth seed win the first match-up, they will au­to­mat­i­cally go into the play-offs. How­ever, if the ninth seed win, then a sec­ond game will be ar­ranged the fol­low­ing week, whereby they will have to tri­umph again to make it to the play­offs.</p>
    <p>The Spurs, who are one game be­hind the eighth-placed Griz­zlies, are hop­ing to fig­ure in that con­ver­sa­tion. Not since the 1996-97 sea­son have San An­to­nio not headed to the post-sea­son.</p>
    <p>They also have a proud his­tory to main­tain – qual­i­fy­ing ev­ery full sea­son un­der Gregg Popovich since – and their 22 con­sec­u­tive play-off ap­pear­ances is a joint-NBA record.</p>
    <p>The long-serv­ing coach feels that it would be a bonus, given that his ros­ter is stacked with in­ex­pe­ri­enced play­ers, with the ex­cep­tion of four-time All-Star DeMar DeRozan.</p>
    <p>Fel­low All-Star LaMar­cus Aldridge un­der­went shoul­der surgery dur­ing the league’s four­month Covid-19 en­forced break, end­ing his sea­son pre­ma­turely.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter his team, who were paced by a 27-point dis­play by DeRozan, sent the Pel­i­cans pack­ing from the “bub­ble” with a 122-113 win, Popovich said: “It’d be huge.</p>
    <p>“If we’re able to be in that ninth spot, that’s quite a victory and it says a lot about how this young group has come to­gether with three of the starters out.</p>
    <p>“I’m al­ready thrilled with how they played, and it’d be re­ally fan­tas­tic if we could get that.”</p>
    <p>Un­like five-time cham­pi­ons San An­to­nio, the Griz­zlies do not have the same stel­lar post-sea­son record with zero ti­tles.</p>
    <p>For Mem­phis, it is sim­ply about reach­ing the play-offs for the first time since 2017 and although they re­main favourites to be part of that play-in game – they need one win out of their two re­main­ing games – guard Ja Mo­rant is con­cerned.</p>
    <p>On their aw­ful run in the “bub­ble” – they have lost five of their six games since the restart on July 30 – the Rookie of the Year con­tender told ESPN: “Our fo­cus now is learn­ing from our mis­takes... and try to fix them when we go out and play Bos­ton (Celtics to­day).”</p>
