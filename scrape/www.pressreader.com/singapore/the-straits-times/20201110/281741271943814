    <p>•</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s de­ci­sion to ex­pand its move­ment curbs to nine states from yes­ter­day due to a spike in coro­n­avirus cases caught many by sur­prise, up­end­ing peo­ple’s plans and prepa­ra­tions for wed­dings, birth­days and pub­lic ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>For Ms Joy Ong, the im­po­si­tion of the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO) in Pe­nang led to her bring­ing for­ward her wed­ding by two weeks, with the determined bride rear­rang­ing her plans within 18 hours.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old de­sign en­gi­neer said her wed­ding reg­is­tra­tion was to have been on Nov 21, with a lunch af­ter that, fol­lowed by a din­ner on Nov 29.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of the CMCO, we brought the cer­e­mony for­ward and tried our luck with our church, pho­tog­ra­pher, make-up artist and our wed­ding decor team. I made many phone calls... and I am grate­ful ev­ery­thing fell into place,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ong, who was speak­ing at her wed­ding at the Pe­nang Chris­tian Cen­tre on Sun­day, said she be­gan reschedul­ing her plans only at 10pm last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>She ini­tially thought she would have to post­pone the wed­ding, but the last-minute changes worked out. “The only set­back was that the restau­rant where we had wanted to hold the lunch was booked... So we found an­other restau­rant.”</p>
    <p>Com­pany ex­ec­u­tive J.X. Liew, 26, found her­self rush­ing home to Ipoh, Perak, last Satur­day night to cel­e­brate her fa­ther’s birth­day.</p>
    <p>“I work in Pe­nang and my par­ents were sup­posed to visit me this week­end to cel­e­brate my fa­ther’s birth­day. But with the CMCO, I rushed home be­fore in­ter­state travel was banned to spend time with them,” said Ms Liew, though she rued the fact that she would be un­likely to cel­e­brate her own birth­day in Ipoh this month.</p>
    <p>“The first lock­down was over­whelm­ing, but at least we have tech­nol­ogy to keep in touch. I do miss them (my par­ents) but it is still man­age­able as I have good friends and col­leagues here in Pe­nang.”</p>
    <p>The CMCO also caused the Si­jil Pe­la­jaran Malaysia (SPM) ex­am­i­na­tion dates to be changed.</p>
    <p>The O-level equiv­a­lent exam is usu­ally held in Novem­ber and De­cem­ber. But the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry had ear­lier changed the exam dates to Jan 6-Feb 9 next year, due to the pan­demic, be­fore fur­ther post­pon­ing them to Feb 22.</p>
    <p>The con­stant changes have caused anx­i­ety and stress, par­ent groups said, ex­ac­er­bated by a year of er­ratic classes and on­line lessons.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents sit­ting the SPM will re­sume lessons in schools from Jan 20 to en­sure they get suf­fi­cient prepa­ra­tion be­fore the ex­ams, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Mohd Radzi Md Jidin said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Mak Chee Kin, chair­man of the Me­laka Ac­tion Group for Par­ents in Ed­u­ca­tion, said the min­istry must be firm on the dates.</p>
    <p>“Make firm de­ci­sions on the dates and have a com­pre­hen­sive plan B if the CMCO con­tin­ues. Stop be­ing fire­fight­ers,” he said. “Come up with safety mea­sures as well to en­sure that the SPM exam is con­ducted smoothly and fairly.”</p>
    <p>Par­ent Ac­tion Group for Ed­u­ca­tion Malaysia chair­man Noor Az­imah Ab­dul Rahim called the reschedul­ing “a tragedy”.</p>
    <p>She added: “Chil­dren are drop­ping out of schools and stress lev­els are ris­ing with the post­pone­ment of the SPM again. How sure are we that it will not be resched­uled again?</p>
    <p>“Pro­long­ing the prob­lem isn’t go­ing to solve the is­sue; en­sur­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the strict stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dure will.”</p>
    <p>Mr Harry Tan, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the National Union of the Teach­ing Pro­fes­sion, said stu­dents’ safety comes first. “How­ever, we hope the min­istry will ad­dress is­sues raised by par­ents, stu­dents and teach­ers quicker and not take too long to re­spond.” Stu­dents them­selves have mixed emo­tions.</p>
    <p>SMK (P) Jalan Ipoh stu­dent Har­ishna Ka­jen­tha­ran, 17, de­scribed the post­pone­ment as “dev­as­tat­ing” as it would af­fect her col­lege en­rol­ment.</p>
    <p>“A lot of my time is go­ing to be wasted but I’m try­ing to stay op­ti­mistic and hope for the best dur­ing this Covid-19 pan­demic,” she said.</p>
    <p>A Sec­ondary 5 stu­dent who wanted to be known as Han from SMK (P) Methodist Ipoh said she was an­noyed that the ex­ams had been post­poned yet again. But it must be done con­sid­er­ing the spike in Covid-19 cases, she con­ceded.</p>
    <p>“My Chi­nese New Year cel­e­bra­tions next year will be filled with mod­ules and work­sheets, so I feel sad think­ing about that,” she added.</p>
    <p>And a 17-year-old stu­dent in Me­laka who wanted to be iden­ti­fied only as Wong from SMK Mun­shi Ab­dul­lah said the news was un­ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“I hope the date will not be post­poned again as it will af­fect my mo­men­tum. I want to move on to the next phase of my life,” she said.</p>
