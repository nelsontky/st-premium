    <p>Sinopharm said in July that its vac­cine could be ready for pub­lic use by the end of this year after the con­clu­sion of Phase 3 tri­als.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac Biotech and Sinopharm had even put their vac­cine can­di­dates on dis­play at a trade fair in Bei­jing this month.</p>
    <p>A fourth Covid-19 vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped by Chi­nese vac­cine com­pany CanSino Bi­o­log­ics was ap­proved for use by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary in June.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • Coro­n­avirus vac­cines be­ing de­vel­oped in China may be ready for use by the gen­eral pub­lic as early as Novem­ber, an of­fi­cial with the Chi­nese Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) said.</p>
    <p>China has four Covid-19 vac­cines in the fi­nal stage of clin­i­cal tri­als. At least three of those have al­ready been of­fered to essen­tial work­ers un­der an emer­gency-use pro­gramme launched in July.</p>
    <p>Phase 3 clin­i­cal tri­als were pro­ceed­ing smoothly and the vac­cines could be ready for the gen­eral pub­lic in Novem­ber or De­cem­ber, CDC chief biosafety ex­pert Wu Guizhen said in an in­ter­view with state TV late on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Wu, who said she has ex­pe­ri­enced no ab­nor­mal symp­toms in re­cent months after tak­ing an ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine her­self in April, did not spec­ify which vac­cines she was re­fer­ring to.</p>
    <p>“I was in­jected with the vac­cine in April as a trial vol­un­teer. I feel good right now,” Prof Wu said, adding that the vac­cine could re­main ef­fec­tive for one to three years.</p>
    <p>A unit of state phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant China Na­tional Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Group (Sinopharm) and USlisted, China-based Si­no­vac Biotech are de­vel­op­ing the three vac­cines un­der the state’s emer­gency use pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>A fourth Covid-19 vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped by Chi­nese vac­cine com­pany CanSino Bi­o­log­ics was ap­proved for use by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary in June.</p>
    <p>Sinopharm said in July that its vac­cine could be ready for pub­lic use by the end of this year after the con­clu­sion of Phase 3 tri­als.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac Biotech and Sinopharm had even put their vac­cine can­di­dates on dis­play at a trade fair in</p>
    <p>Bei­jing this month.</p>
    <p>A Si­no­vac spokesman told AFP this month that “tens of thou­sands” of peo­ple had vol­un­tar­ily taken its vac­cine, in­clud­ing 90 per cent of its em­ploy­ees and their fam­i­lies – be­tween 2,000 and 3,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Global vac­cine-mak­ers are rac­ing to de­velop an ef­fec­tive vac­cine against the virus which has killed more than 929,000 peo­ple. There are cur­rently nine vac­cine can­di­dates in late-stage hu­man tri­als.</p>
    <p>In an­other de­vel­op­ment, a Chi­nese-de­vel­oped Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date has be­come the first nasal spray for the dis­ease to be­gin hu­man testing, Caixin Global re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Univer­sity of Hong Kong (HKU) an­nounced last week that clin­i­cal tri­als for the spray had been ap­proved by China’s Na­tional Med­i­cal Prod­ucts Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine has been co-de­vel­oped by HKU, Xi­a­men Univer­sity as well as vac­cine-maker Bei­jing Wan­tai Bi­o­log­i­cal Phar­macy En­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine has be­come the 10th can­di­date from China and the 32nd in the world to pro­ceed into the hu­man testing phase, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s list of can­di­date vac­cines. It is the only nasal spray on the list that has of Wed­nes­day moved to clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists hope that a vac­cine de­liv­ered via the nose would be more ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing in­fec­tion by the coro­n­avirus, which spreads through the res­pi­ra­tory tract,</p>
    <p>Caixin Global re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist Chen Honglin at HKU told Caixin that if a new wave of the Covid-19 out­break ar­rives to­gether with in­fluenza, the nasal spray will be “the eas­i­est, most eco­nom­i­cal and prac­ti­cal long-term path­way”.</p>
