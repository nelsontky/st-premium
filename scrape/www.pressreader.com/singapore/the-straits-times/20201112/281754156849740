    <p>YAN­GON • Myan­mar’s main op­po­si­tion party yes­ter­day de­manded a re­run of a par­lia­men­tary elec­tion and called for mil­i­tary help to en­sure fair­ness as par­tial re­sults put Ms Aung San Suu Kyi’s rul­ing party on course for an­other com­mand­ing vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary-backed Union Sol­i­dar­ity and De­vel­op­ment Party (USDP) called on the au­thor­i­ties to hold an­other con­test as soon as pos­si­ble “in or­der to have an elec­tion that is free, fair, un­bi­ased and free from un­fair cam­paign­ing”.</p>
    <p>The USDP chal­lenge came as the rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD) party looked set for its sec­ond suc­ces­sive elec­tion sweep – it has wins in more than 80 per cent of seats so far de­clared, with about a third of the re­sults an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The NLD won 130 of the 158 de­clared seats in the bi­cam­eral leg­is­la­ture, com­pared with 15 for the USDP.</p>
    <p>The NLD needs 322 seats to form the next gov­ern­ment and has al­ready claimed vic­tory in Sun­day’s con­test. The NLD won by a sim­i­lar mar­gin in the last elec­tion in 2015, which was the first vote since the end of nearly 50 years of strict mil­i­tary rule and quasi-mil­i­tary rule.</p>
    <p>A big win would be a wel­come boost to Ms Suu Kyi, a No­bel Peace lau­re­ate who has had a tur­bu­lent first term. She strug­gled to meet high public ex­pec­ta­tions while tasked with de­vel­op­ing a coun­try that suf­fered decades of de­cay and gov­ern­ing with a mil­i­tary that per­se­cuted her and the NLD for years.</p>
    <p>The bal­lot was seen as a ref­er­en­dum on her fledg­ling demo­cratic gov­ern­ment, which is hugely popular at home, although its rep­u­ta­tion abroad has col­lapsed ow­ing to ac­cu­sa­tions of geno­cide against the coun­try’s Ro­hingya Mus­lim mi­nor­ity, which it de­nies.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral dozen pro-USDP demon­stra­tors gath­ered yes­ter­day in the cap­i­tal, Naypy­itaw, car­ry­ing signs with slo­gans call­ing for a new and fair elec­tion. The party al­leged ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties which in­cluded poorqual­ity bal­lot boxes and en­velopes, ad­vance vot­ing prob­lems and gov­ern­ment cash hand­outs that it said amounted to NLD bribes.</p>
    <p>It also said that cel­e­bra­tory gath­er­ings by NLD sup­port­ers breached coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The USDP chal­lenge comes af­ter weeks of un­ver­i­fied con­tent and dis­in­for­ma­tion spread on so­cial me­dia about elec­toral fraud or ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties be­fore the bal­lot.</p>
    <p>The NLD de­manded proof of wrong­do­ing. “There will al­ways be some peo­ple who say it is not fair,” NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said. “They must present ev­i­dence for their ac­cu­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary in an ear­lier state­ment said the elec­tion was car­ried out “suc­cess­fully”.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional and lo­cal ob­servers said the vote went smoothly and with­out ma­jor ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties. The elec­tion com­mis­sion yes­ter­day said the al­le­ga­tions were from a mi­nor­ity of par­tic­i­pants and the rest had ap­proved.</p>
