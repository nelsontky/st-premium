    <p>NEW DELHI • A briyani worth savour­ing is a daunt­ing labour of love that can stretch over hours. But I am told I will have to wait no longer than 35 min­utes for my or­der of Luc­knowi chicken briyani.</p>
    <p>I am at a Biryani By Kilo (BBK) kitchen in Noida, a Delhi sub­urb. It is a chain that trans­formed the painstak­ing cen­turies-old process of mak­ing briyani, which in­volves lay­er­ing rice and meat in var­i­ous stages of done­ness into a pot that is sealed and cooked fur­ther, into a pre­ci­sion-driven dash.</p>
    <p>Four pieces of semi-cooked chicken that have been mar­i­nated in their pro­pri­etary spice mix are whipped out of a freezer. They are dunked into a wok to­gether with some milk and screw pine essence.</p>
    <p>A few min­utes on the flame, the meat is then passed on to Mr Mo­hammed Kazim, one of the em­ploy­ees, who lays it into a small earthen pot.</p>
    <p>The other pre­pared in­gre­di­ents are quickly lay­ered in – all ac­cord­ing to spec­i­fi­ca­tions on a chart that is glued on an op­po­site wall – and the pot is sealed with dough. An­other four min­utes on the flame and it is then popped into an oven for 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The en­tire process, true to their com­mit­ment, takes just un­der 35 min­utes. This zippy model has trans­formed briyani into In­dia’s most-or­dered item on food de­liv­ery plat­forms, with mul­ti­ple vari­ants now avail­able through restau­rants as well as cloud kitchens that are eas­ily ac­ces­si­ble on­line.</p>
    <p>As many as 100 mil­lion por­tions of briyani were or­dered last year on In­dia’s top food ag­gre­ga­tors – Zo­mato, Swiggy and Uber Eats.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the to­tal briyani mar­ket (both or­gan­ised and un­or­gan­ised) was es­ti­mated to be 275 bil­lion ru­pees (S$5 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Even the lock­down – or the oc­ca­sional use of briyani as a slur to at­tack Mus­lims and other “anti-na­tion­als” – has not dis­lodged the dish from its pre-em­i­nent po­si­tion on food de­liv­ery apps.</p>
    <p>Its time­less ap­peal as an aro­matic one-pot meal has ce­mented the dish’s pop­u­lar­ity in a rice-eat­ing na­tion that also loves meat. Whether it is a lazy night at home or a party, an or­der of chicken or mut­ton briyani is bound to be a crowd-pleaser.</p>
    <p>When it launched its first out­let in 2015, BBK tapped this grow­ing ap­petite for a quick fix of briyani.</p>
    <p>“I have never seen an out­let ramp up that fast in terms of sales and re­peat cus­tomers,” said Mr Kaushik Roy, one of the two BBK co-founders, who launched close to 200 restau­rants in his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>The chain has since grown to 41 out­lets across the coun­try, ac­count­ing for around 9,000 pots of briyani daily that come in two op­tions – 500g and 1kg.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy al­lows every or­der at BBK to be tracked un­til it is de­liv­ered, and 70 per cent of its or­ders reach cus­tomers in less than 60 min­utes. In­di­vid­ual cus­tomer pref­er­ences are also tracked on its in-house soft­ware for tar­geted mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic whiplash­ing the restau­rant in­dus­try, the cloud kitchen model sell­ing briyani for de­liv­ery and take­outs has come in handy for those forced to rein­vent their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>Mr Sap­tadeep Roy, who worked as an area gen­eral man­ager for an Ital­ian restau­rant chain in Pune, is one of them. The chain’s out­lets were closed tem­po­rar­ily in March be­cause of the lock­down.</p>
    <p>With no cer­tainty of when they would re­open, he quit his job that month and started a briyani de­liv­ery chain – Biryani De­pot – in Au­gust with a cloud kitchen in Pune that ac­counts for over 3,500 briyani serv­ings every month.</p>
    <p>He plans to open an­other 40 kitchens across the coun­try by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>It is a thriv­ing pan­demic-era busi­ness for­mula that not only reaches out to cus­tomers wary of eat­ing out, but also works around steep rentals that de­ter launches of dine-in restau­rants.</p>
    <p>The choice of briyani was easy for Mr Sap­tadeep Roy, who wanted to tar­get a mass au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>“Briyani is a kind of emo­tion for In­di­ans. Every re­gion has its own briyani, ev­ery­one is fa­mil­iar with it,” he said. Lesser-known re­gional vari­a­tions in­clude those made with tapi­oca, jack­fruit and even fish.</p>
    <p>The dish is also de­liv­ered with ease, a crit­i­cal as­set for cloud kitchens. Dosas get soggy and cur­ries spill, un­like a briyani that re­mains snug­gly warm in its pot for an hour or two.</p>
    <p>Said BBK’s Mr Kaushik Roy: “That way, it is a very apt In­dian prod­uct to be de­liv­ered home.”</p>
    <p>Briyani is also cen­tral to Rebel Foods, which de­scribes it­self as the “world’s largest In­ter­net restau­rant com­pany” and op­er­ates over 300 cloud kitchens in In­dia. Two of its brands – Behrouz and The Biryani Life – are built around the dish.</p>
    <p>In July, it re­ceived fund­ing from a host of in­vestors, in­clud­ing Go­jek.</p>
    <p>Over the next year or so, Rebel Foods and Go­jek plan to build around 100 cloud kitchens in In­done­sia serv­ing nasi goreng and pos­si­bly even briyani, among other dishes.</p>
    <p>But true con­nois­seurs feel the mass pro­duc­tion of briyani – in­clud­ing that which is cooked and frozen to be re­heated and de­liv­ered – has re­duced the dish to a soul­less as­sem­bly-line pas­tiche.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants even have com­po­nents of briyani pre­pared and stocked sep­a­rately, ready to be as­sem­bled and mi­crowaved on or­der.</p>
    <p>Mr Osama Jalali, a food his­to­rian who is work­ing on a book on briyani, tells me he has even come across in­stances where re­duced meat cur­ries are lay­ered with rice and then cooked as if it were briyani, a dish that re­quires rice to be par­tially cooked in meat stock. It’s a sac­ri­lege, he said.</p>
    <p>“Maybe 10 years down the line, we may call any com­bi­na­tion of meat and rice a briyani.</p>
    <p>“It is the pro­ce­dure of mak­ing briyani that makes briyani what it is and that is get­ting lost in this race,” Mr Jalali added.</p>
    <p>He launched Vil­lage Degh in Au­gust, a cloud kitchen that sells two vari­ants of briyani that are slow-cooked over four hours in large pots. He told me proudly that his unit, which runs out of a farm in Gur­gaon, uses no elec­tri­cal ap­pli­ances or gas, re­ly­ing in­stead on mor­tar and pes­tle and fire­wood.</p>
    <p>Also scep­ti­cal of or­der­ing briyani from untested cloud kitchens, Ms Mar­ryam H. Reshii, a Delhi-based food writer, de­scribed the dish as a “huge art form” and a “won­der­ful sub­ject to keep study­ing and dis­cov­er­ing more and more nuances”.</p>
    <p>She had such an ex­pe­ri­ence at a Map­pila wed­ding a few years ago.</p>
    <p>The Map­pi­las are a Mus­lim com­mu­nity in north Ker­ala and the mut­ton briyani – the only dish served at the wed­ding – was made with fra­grant lo­cal kaima rice. The rice in the briyani, she said, was white with no at­tempt to in­ject colour with fried onions or spices.</p>
    <p>“Is this re­ally briyani?” Ms Reshii and her North In­dian friends kept ask­ing one an­other. “It was just a play with the stock but the stock was so full of flavour that one didn’t need colour. I mean, if that’s not art, then what is art?” she added.</p>
    <p>It was the same mas­tery of flavour and aroma that won me over a few years ago at a potluck din­ner at which a friend coaxed me to taste some of the mut­ton briyani he had pre­pared.</p>
    <p>I had given up eat­ing red meat for years but that day, his ex­quis­ite mix of rice and meat left me hun­gry for more. I’d eat it again with­out hes­i­ta­tion. That’s the magic of briyani done re­ally well – it trans­forms even the scep­tic into a de­vout fol­lower.</p>
