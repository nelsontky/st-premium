    <p>PARIS • First, book­stores across lit­er­a­ture-obsessed France were or­dered to close in a new lock­down to curb an alarm­ing rise in coro­n­avirus cases. A few days later, the govern­ment also banned su­per­mar­kets from sell­ing books in a bid to parry claims of un­fair com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Book­worms were left be­fud­dled as store own­ers, authors and lo­cal politi­cians fumed.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sion to close book­shelves in su­per­mar­kets is stupid. It robs peo­ple in lock­down of cul­ture,” said Ms Sylvie Lagrange, an avid reader who vis­ited her li­brary in Paris to “stock up” be­fore the start of a month of lock­down due to last un­til end-Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>She was not alone. Peo­ple flocked to pub­lic li­braries be­fore they too were closed – some 8,000 books were taken out in a just a few hours at the li­brary in Vil­leneuve d’Ascq, out­side Lille along the bor­der with Bel­gium.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies show that France has some of the high­est book read­er­ship fig­ures in the world and one of the dens­est net­works of book­stores. The SLF union of French book­stores says the coun­try has some 3,300 out­lets – one for ev­ery 20,300 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Un­like many of its neigh­bours that have is­sued stay-at-home or­ders, France de­creed book­shops among “non-es­sen­tial” busi­nesses un­der the lat­est lock­down rules. Also closed are hair­dressers and bar­bers, toy stores, florists, cine­mas and malls – while cloth­ing stores, spe­cial­ity food re­tail­ers, elec­tron­ics spe­cial­ists and oth­ers were al­lowed to re­main open.</p>
    <p>But it was ac­cess to books that mo­bilised protests in a coun­try with some 16,000 pub­lic li­braries as well as nu­mer­ous prizes for authors and tele­vi­sion pro­grammes ded­i­cated to lit­er­ary mus­ings.</p>
    <p>“Politi­cians boast a great deal about the idea that France is a na­tion of read­ers and book­stores. But just like that, we re­alise this was all hot air,” said ac­claimed au­thor Syl­vain Tes­son.</p>
    <p>Since the lock­down started on Oct 30, anger has grown, with a pe­ti­tion to Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, mut­ter­ings about flout­ing the ban and calls to boy­cott Ama­zon, which threat­ens to reap the lion’s share of book pur­chases. The an­nounce­ment of lit­er­ary prizes, in­clud­ing the pres­ti­gious Prix Gon­court, was post­poned by or­gan­is­ers un­til book­stores re­open.</p>
    <p>Un­der pres­sure, the govern­ment re­lented, but not i n the way ex­pected. Just days after the ini­tial an­nounce­ment, Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said that in­stead of al­low­ing book­stores to re­open, the govern­ment would ban su­per­mar­kets from sell­ing books too.</p>
    <p>Cul­ture Min­is­ter Rose­lyne Bach­e­lot said postage would be re­duced for book­shops to mail or­ders to read­ers in a bid to pre­vent large e-com­merce com­pa­nies tak­ing over the field. But the mea­sures did lit­tle to ap­pease book­store own­ers, whose turnover fell by some 95 per cent in France’s first lock­down, from March to May this year.</p>
    <p>The SLF urged Pres­i­dent Macron to re­mem­ber “that the book is a prod­uct un­like any other: it is a good that must be pro­tected by the na­tion, un­der all cir­cum­stances”.</p>
    <p>“Book­stores play a unique role in... trans­mit­ting cul­ture and knowl­edge,” it said in a state­ment. “They are also one of the most ef­fec­tive ram­parts against ig­no­rance and in­tol­er­ance.”</p>
