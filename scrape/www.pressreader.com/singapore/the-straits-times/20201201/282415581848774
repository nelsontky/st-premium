    <p>LON­DON • Jose Mour­inho knows bet­ter than most the value of grind­ing out points i n away games against di­rect ri­vals so while his re­ac­tion to Tot­ten­ham’s 0-0 Premier League draw at Chelsea on Sun­day was sub­dued, i nside, he would have been de­lighted.</p>
    <p>Spurs did not have an at­tempt on tar­get in the se­cond half at Stam­ford Bridge but they were tough to break down, as they claimed a point from a derby that has of­ten been un­kind to them.</p>
    <p>While fans may ques­tion the en­ter­tain­ment value, and leav­ing Gareth Bale on the bench, the draw put the vis­i­tors back into top spot on goal dif­fer­ence above cham­pi­ons Liverpool, with Chelsea two points be­hind in third on 19 points.</p>
    <p>“The best thing I take from the game is that the dress­ing room is not happy, we are not happy,” said Spurs man­ager Mour­inho, whose side are un­beaten in the league since their open­ing-day de­feat by Ever­ton and have kept three suc­ces­sive clean sheets.</p>
    <p>“That for me is fan­tas­tic, it’s a com­plete change of men­tal­ity.”</p>
    <p>Mour­inho, who won three league ti­tles in two sep­a­rate stints at Chelsea, has vowed to turn Spurs into win­ners, in­ject­ing more prag­ma­tism into a team who threat­ened to win tro­phies un­der pre­de­ces­sor Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino but never de­liv­ered any.</p>
    <p>Sky Sports pun­dit Jamie Red­knapp said the Por­tuguese would be de­lighted with his side earn­ing a point, hav­ing lost both l eague games to Chelsea last sea­son.</p>
    <p>“I imag­ine Jose said at half-time, ‘Let’s get a point by hook or by crook’, he said. “They beat Manch­ester City last week, now they get a point at a vi­brant Chelsea side. It’s not pretty but he is try­ing to turn this Spurs team into win­ners.”</p>
    <p>But in his post-match news con­fer­ence, Mour­inho down­played their chances of land­ing a first league ti­tle since 1961.</p>
    <p>“We’re not even in the (ti­tle) race so we’re not a horse. We’re a pony,” he said.</p>
    <p>His op­po­site num­ber Frank Lam­pard ad­mit­ted the hosts lacked a lit­tle bit of “magic” to prise open Spurs’ de­fence, which was mar­shalled by dead­line-day sign­ing Joe Rodon on his first league start.</p>
    <p>“I thought we dom­i­nated big parts of the game,” the Blues boss said. “We al­most gifted them a goal. It’s hard to break down when Spurs de­fend with the low block.</p>
    <p>“I am sort of bal­anced af­ter the game. Big parts were great, hence the clean sheet. But a game we maybe should have won.”</p>
    <p>But he dis­missed Mour­inho’s sug­ges­tions that Spurs were dark horses, claim­ing it was mind games from his for­mer men­tor.</p>
    <p>“It’s Jose’s call to say it as he sees it from his end,” he said. “If we’re con­tenders, then they have to be con­tenders... They would ex­pect to be in the race... I think we are all com­pet­ing.”</p>
