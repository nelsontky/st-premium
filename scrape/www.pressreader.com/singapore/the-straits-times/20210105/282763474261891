    <p>It has been well over two years since TikTok ar­rived in the United States in Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>The app had ev­ery­thing: so­cial com­men­tary, com­edy, craft­ing, memes, chal­lenges, make-up tu­to­ri­als and, of course, dances.</p>
    <p>Even those who were not sold on it could not avoid the videos, which pro­lif­er­ated across plat­forms such as In­sta­gram, YouTube and Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>By April last year, TikTok had been down­loaded more than 2 bil­lion times; in the au­tumn, it had an es­ti­mated 850 mil­lion monthly ac­tive users.</p>
    <p>De­spite its growth in size and scope, the unini­ti­ated still largely view the app as a tool for very young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>While TikTok has trans­formed dance cul­ture on­line, the plat­form has more broadly be­come a rich so­cial and en­ter­tain­ment net­work. And last year, there was hardly a cor­ner of so­ci­ety it did not touch.</p>
    <p>TURN­ING EN­TER­TAIN­MENT ON ITS HEAD</p>
    <p>TikTok’s most ob­vi­ous im­pact can be seen in the en­ter­tain­ment world.</p>
    <p>“More than any other so­cial net­work since MyS­pace, it feels like a new ex­pe­ri­ence, the emer­gence of a dif­fer­ent kind of tech­nol­ogy and a dif­fer­ent mode of con­sum­ing me­dia,” jour­nal­ist Kyle Chayka wrote in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Pri­mar­ily re­spon­si­ble for the unique­ness of the TikTok view­ing ex­pe­ri­ence is the For You page, an al­go­rith­mi­cally pro­grammed feed that serves users the con­tent they are likely to find en­gag­ing.</p>
    <p>Users need not fol­low or be fol­lowed by any­one to see the videos they want to see, or to have their own videos be seen by their in­tended au­di­ence, which has af­forded many peo­ple a rapid rise to fame.</p>
    <p>In the last year alone, top users like Charli and Dixie D’Ame­lio and Ad­di­son Easter­ling amassed tens of mil­lions of fol­low­ers and be­came house­hold names. The D’Ame­lios even landed a Hulu show.</p>
    <p>The app has also rein­vig­o­rated the mu­sic in­dus­try and be­come a place to dis­cover tal­ent, mar­ket songs, col­lab­o­ra­tively pro­duce new mu­sic and mash up tracks.</p>
    <p>SHAP­ING SHOP­PING BE­HAV­IOUR</p>
    <p>TikTok has had an un­de­ni­able ef­fect on what peo­ple wear and buy. Users ap­peared in cam­paigns for Louis Vuit­ton and Prada, signed with agen­cies like IMG Mod­els and shaped trends (think cot­tagecore and the straw­berry dress).</p>
    <p>Mass-mar­ket brands have also aligned with in­flu­encers. While phys­i­cal stores were closed in the early months of the pan­demic, new brands and shops popped up on TikTok. Ma­jor re­tail­ers such as Sephora, Dunkin’ Donuts and GameS­top even en­cour­aged their staff to be­come TikTok in­flu­encers.</p>
    <p>A VIEW OF THE FRONT LINES</p>
    <p>Ser­vice work­ers were some of the first peo­ple to em­brace TikTok in 2018. Last year, the pub­lic got a whole new view of these work­ers’ lives.</p>
    <p>Ware­house work­ers, fast-food em­ploy­ees and baris­tas turned to TikTok to give oth­ers a glimpse of their lives, some­times find­ing un­in­ten­tional fame.</p>
    <p>Many of their in­dus­tries were hit hard by the pan­demic and lever­aged TikTok to pro­mote fund-rais­ing and re­lief ef­forts.</p>
    <p>As the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ued to spread, TikTok played a key pub­lic health role.</p>
    <p>Nurses, doc­tors and other front-line health work­ers used TikTok to ex­plain the im­por­tance of mask-wear­ing and break down mis­in­for­ma­tion on vac­cines.</p>
    <p>HELP­ING PEO­PLE TO OR­GAN­ISE AND SPEAK OUT</p>
    <p>As the Black Lives Mat­ter movement gained sup­port across the US last sum­mer, TikTok be­came a space where young ac­tivists could talk about po­lice bru­tal­ity and crim­i­nal jus­tice re­form, as well as the plat­form’s own re­la­tion­ship to black cre­ators.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal ac­tivism has been fruit­ful on the app. In June, TikTok users or­gan­ised a cam­paign to in­flate at­ten­dance ex­pec­ta­tions for US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign rally in Tulsa, Ok­la­homa. Pho­to­graphs showed a sparse crowd, with many empty seats.</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING PEO­PLE CON­NECTED</p>
    <p>Af­ter many US schools moved learn­ing on­line last year, stu­dents and teach­ers turned to TikTok to com­mis­er­ate about the strug­gles of ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents hosted live-streamed study ses­sions in which they helped each other with home­work, and used TikTok to share study tips and on­line learn­ing hacks with their peers.</p>
    <p>The app fos­tered friend­ships and ro­mances across dis­tances. It also helped par­ents com­mis­er­ate over the chal­lenges of car­ing for chil­dren and nav­i­gat­ing adult­hood.</p>
    <p>LIFE-AF­FIRM­ING TRENDS</p>
    <p>One of the ear­li­est trends on TikTok last year was the Rene­gade, a dance chore­ographed by Jala­iah Har­mon, 15, to the song Lot­tery by At­lanta rap­per K-Camp.</p>
    <p>The dance, pop­u­larised pri­mar­ily by white in­flu­encers, broke open a di­a­logue about black cre­ators and giv­ing credit where it is due.</p>
    <p>Vi­ral food cul­ture also mi­grated from In­sta­gram to TikTok. The plat­form pop­u­larised pan­cake ce­real, whipped cof­fee and car­rot ba­con.</p>
    <p>It also helped up-and-com­ers, such as 18-year-old culi­nary dar­ling Ei­tan Ber­nath, get dis­cov­ered and taught mil­lions stuck at home dur­ing quar­an­tine how to cook.</p>
