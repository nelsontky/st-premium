    <p>Dr Galuh Chan­dra Ki­rana Su­gianto has been very busy at a pri­vate hos­pi­tal in Jakarta since last month.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial­ist in in­ter­nal medicine is tak­ing care of up to 30 Covid-19 pa­tients three days a week, on top of her du­ties at an­other two hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of pa­tients, in­clud­ing those in the in­ten­sive care unit (ICU), is the most she has ever had to han­dle.</p>
    <p>“We face high risks each time we re­port for duty. Al­though we try to com­ply with the pro­to­cols, we won’t know how we can con­tract the virus,” Dr Galuh told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate hos­pi­tal, which be­gan ac­cept­ing Covid-19 pa­tients since April, has a ca­pac­ity of some 130 beds but can utilise only up to 50 due to a lack of man­power.</p>
    <p>As de­mand picked up, the hos­pi­tal ex­panded the num­ber of ICU beds to 10 last week, two more than be­fore, al­though with­out any in­crease in staff.</p>
    <p>“Many health work­ers, es­pe­cially those hav­ing ba­bies or tod­dlers and el­derly par­ents, are re­luc­tant to serve at hos­pi­tals des­ig­nated for Covid-19 pa­tients due to the sig­nif­i­cant risks,” said Dr Galuh, who has been stay­ing apart from her fam­ily since be­ing roped in to deal with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The grim sit­u­a­tion is not unique to the pri­vate hos­pi­tal where Dr Galuh works. It is one of 67 re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals in Jakarta, a city of 10 mil­lion where the num­ber of in­fec­tions has shot up by around 1,000 a day.</p>
    <p>Dr Er­lina Burhan, a spokesman for Per­sa­ha­batan Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, which has 208 beds, in­clud­ing 16 ICU beds, said the oc­cu­pancy rate for non-ICU beds was higher than 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>ICU beds were oc­cu­pied all the time, re­sult­ing in a long queue.</p>
    <p>“We saw a de­cline in pa­tients in April and May fol­low­ing the strict par­tial lock­down, but when it was eased, the num­ber of pa­tients climbed again,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I am wor­ried about fa­tigue among our health work­ers. They re­ally need rest. Oth­er­wise, they fall sick,” she added.</p>
    <p>A survey of 1,461 health work­ers na­tion­wide by the Univer­sity of In­done­sia’s fac­ulty of medicine found that 83 per cent of them had ex­pe­ri­enced burnout.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian Medical As­so­cia</p>
    <p>tion re­ported that 115 doc­tors had died of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Jakarta re­ported 1,205 new Covid-19 cases and 18 more deaths.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has recorded 214,746 con­firmed Covid-19 cases, of which 52,840 were from Jakarta. The num­ber of deaths to­talled 8,650 na­tion­wide, with 1,386 re­ported in Jakarta alone as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan on Wednesday an­nounced the re-im­po­si­tion of strict social re­stric­tions from to­mor­row to curb the spread of Covid-19, warn­ing that the city’s hos­pi­tals would reach full ca­pac­ity by Sept 17 with­out in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures pro­vided by the city ad­min­is­tra­tion showed that the oc­cu­pancy rate of iso­la­tion rooms at the 67 re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals had reached 77 per cent, and that for ICUs had hit 83 per cent.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion plans to ex­pand ca­pac­ity by around 20 per cent by press­ing more pri­vate hos­pi­tals to help deal with the surge in cases. This will raise the num­ber of iso­la­tion beds to 4,807 from 4,053.</p>
    <p>But Mr Anies said this ex­pan­sion alone would not al­le­vi­ate the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“If it were not cou­pled with strict ef­forts to curb the spread of the virus, we would reach this new ca­pac­ity by the sec­ond week of Oc­to­ber,” he said.</p>
    <p>Co­or­di­nat­ing Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Min­is­ter Luhut Pandjaitan yes­ter­day dis­puted the Jakarta ad­min­is­tra­tion’s data, say­ing the over­all oc­cu­pancy rate of hos­pi­tals in Jakarta was around 60 per cent, which he de­scribed as “a safe level”.</p>
