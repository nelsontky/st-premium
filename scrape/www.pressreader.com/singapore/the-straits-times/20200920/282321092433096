    <p>Wind in my hair, pad­dles slic­ing wa­ter, sea­wa­ter fleck­ing legs and shoul­ders. I taste salt on my lips and feel a de­li­cious burn in my arms. There is some­thing about phys­i­cal rigour that makes one feel alive.</p>
    <p>Perched in an in­flat­able kayak, pad­dling across the gulf of wa­ter sep­a­rat­ing Labrador Park from Sen­tosa, it strikes me that I have not felt this way in a while.</p>
    <p>Kayak­ing, along with other rugged, out­doorsy ac­tiv­i­ties such as trekking, div­ing and raft­ing, are not things I nor­mally as­so­ciate with Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Today’s ex­pe­di­tion with Ninja Kayak­ers, a small out­fit founded by Mr Clarence Chua, 37, looks set to de­bunk that.</p>
    <p>Our first stop, a rocky beach called Tan­jong Ri­mau on the western tip of Sen­tosa, beck­ons as we ap­proach, stroke by la­bo­ri­ous stroke.</p>
    <p>Once there, a scram­ble over mossy rocks gives way to a se­cluded beach book­ended by World War II gun tur­rets, re­painted a cheery blue and yel­low.</p>
    <p>We pick our way across slip­pery rocks and shimmy up a steep dirt slope to the tow­ers, and are re­warded with a post­card-wor­thy view, more pre­cious be­cause there is no one else around.</p>
    <p>This is the eter­nal para­dox of travel – we seek to dis­cover un­der­the-radar spots, yet are loathe to share them with the masses.</p>
    <p>“This is the best brunch spot in Sin­ga­pore,” de­clares Mr Chua, hand­ing out ham and cheese sand­wiches for our first break of the day.</p>
    <p>Places like th­ese are ex­actly what he sought to dis­cover when he bought his first in­flat­able kayak in 2010.</p>
    <p>“Many years ago, I was kayak-less and on a bum­boat to Pu­lau Ubin. I saw this guy just kayak­ing solo, close to the shore­line. It was like a vi­sion out of a dream. There were no roads, and he was free to go any­where he wanted,” says the fa­ther of two, who is also the gen­eral man­ager of land­scap­ing com­pany Coun­try Cousins.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing ex­plored nu­mer­ous rivers and reser­voirs over the years with friends and fam­ily, he set up Ninja Kayak­ers in July af­ter be­ing ap­proached by friends to run a tour for them.</p>
    <p>Two types of routes are avail­able – ru­ral ones around Pu­lau Ubin and Coney Is­land where you “don’t see a sin­gle build­ing”, and ur­ban routes like the one we are on, which of­fer an al­ter­na­tive view of fa­mil­iar sights.</p>
    <p>Full-day and overnight ad­ven­tures are avail­able, and the more gung-ho can even cus­tomise their own ex­pe­di­tion.</p>
    <p>In­flat­able kayaks, no less stable than the hard­shell va­ri­ety, of­fer more flex­i­bil­ity. They are more eas­ily de­ployed and can be packed away at the end, so there is no need to make the re­turn jour­ney with jelly arms.</p>
    <p>We face no such risk, as our 2.5km Secret Sen­tosa route is the short­est one avail­able.</p>
    <p>Even so, there is plenty to see, in­clud­ing the man­i­cured gar­dens of Shangri-La’s Rasa Sen­tosa Re­sort and Spa and beaches dot­ted with in­flat­able slides, vol­ley­ball courts and bikini-clad sunbed loungers.</p>
    <p>From afar, I spot a brave soul dan­gling by the an­kles on the AJ Hack­ett bungee jump. My com­pan­ion and I make a pact to re­turn and do it to­gether.</p>
    <p>With the wind at our backs, we ar­rive all too soon at our penul­ti­mate stop, an islet break­wa­ter op­po­site Siloso beach. The wa­ter is clear and the sand waves pris­tine on the semi-cir­cu­lar beach we can make out in the ris­ing tide.</p>
    <p>So many times, I have stared at th­ese break­wa­ters and won­dered if it was pos­si­ble to swim across from Sen­tosa. As it turns out, they are yet an­other tiny slice of par­adise.</p>
    <p>I scram­ble up some rocks onto a plateau to find Mr Cle­ment Chua, 31, Clarence’s younger brother who helps out on tours, al­ready stir­ring two pots of pasta on out­door stoves. He has even brought along condi­ments, parme­san cheese, cold drinks and beer.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the morn­ing’s ex­er­tions, the sim­ple fare tastes grand. It has been hours since I last looked at my phone.</p>
    <p>Be­hind us, the is­land thrums with man-made ac­tiv­ity. But look­ing out, the view is all sea and sky.</p>
    <p>The name Sen­tosa trans­lates to peace and tran­quil­lity. In seek­ing out the is­land’s se­crets, I have ex­pe­ri­enced what its name means.</p>
