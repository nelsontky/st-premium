    <p>Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia will start dis­cus­sions on “green lane” ar­range­ments to re­sume es­sen­tial of­fi­cial and busi­ness travel between the two neigh­bours, For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan and his vis­it­ing coun­ter­part Retno Mar­sudi said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) said that given the strong busi­ness links between the two coun­tries, both min­is­ters have tasked their of­fi­cials to be­gin dis­cus­sions on a re­cip­ro­cal green lane.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said such an ar­range­ment would “al­low for es­sen­tial travel to grad­u­ally re­sume in a man­ner that would safe­guard public health and safety in both coun­tries”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cur­rently has green lane ar­range­ments in place with Malaysia and China, and is dis­cussing sim­i­lar ar­range­ments with a num­ber of other coun­tries, in­clud­ing Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has travel cor­ri­dor ar­range­ments for es­sen­tial busi­ness travel with China, South Korea and the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>Ms Retno, who is on a three-day visit to Sin­ga­pore, was hosted to lunch by Dr Balakr­ish­nan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They agreed that Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia should work closely to­gether to strengthen public health co­op­er­a­tion, en­hance eco­nomic growth and in­vest­ments, deepen fi­nan­cial co­op­er­a­tion and fa­cil­i­tate safe travel, MFA said.</p>
    <p>“As close neigh­bours, Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia have co­op­er­ated well to tackle the com­mon chal­lenges brought about by Covid-19 over the past few months,” Dr Balakr­ish­nan said in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>Ms Retno also paid a courtesy call on Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong at the Is­tana. They reaf­firmed the ex­cel­lent re­la­tions between Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia, MFA said.</p>
    <p>They also dis­cussed how the two coun­tries can con­tinue to work to­gether to over­come the com­mon chal­lenges brought about by the pan­demic, and en­cour­aged fur­ther bi­lat­eral dis­cus­sions between their of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, PM Lee said he had spo­ken to In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo sev­eral times in the past few months, and con­tin­ued the dis­cus­sion with Ms Retno on jointly over­com­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is glad to have been able to con­trib­ute med­i­cal sup­plies to sup­port In­done­sia’s fight against Covid-19,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has sent di­ag­nos­tic tests, poly­merase chain re­ac­tion ma­chines for the de­tec­tion of Covid-19, as well as per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and ther­mal scan­ners, among other items, to In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>PM Lee added that Sin­ga­pore is on track to again be the top for­eign in­vestor in In­done­sia this year, as has been the case since 2014.</p>
    <p>“Even as we pick up the pieces from the pan­demic, we should not ne­glect help­ing each other re­cover from this cri­sis,” he said. “As close neigh­bours, we have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to look out for each other, as we are all stronger to­gether.”</p>
