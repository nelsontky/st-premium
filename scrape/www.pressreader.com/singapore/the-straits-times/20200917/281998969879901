    <p>•</p>
    <p>GAZA CITY Is­rael bombed Gaza yes­ter­day after mil­i­tants fired rock­ets through the night, over­shad­ow­ing the sign­ing of land­mark nor­mal­i­sa­tion deals with the United Arab Emi­rates and Bahrain in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin</p>
    <p>Ne­tanyahu ac­cused the mil­i­tants of seek­ing to stop the peace deals, Is­rael’s first with an Arab coun­try since 1994.</p>
    <p>But Gaza ruler Ha­mas warned Is­rael it faced an es­ca­la­tion if the bomb­ing con­tin­ued, barely two weeks after a re­newed Egyp­tian­bro­kered truce halted near-nightly ex­changes across the bor­der last month.</p>
    <p>The sign­ing of the two agree­ments at a White House cer­e­mony hosted by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump prompted protest ral­lies across the Pales­tinian ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The deals broke with decades of Arab con­sen­sus that there would be no nor­mal­i­sa­tion of re­la­tions with Is­rael un­til it had made peace with the Pales­tini­ans, and drew ac­cu­sa­tions of be­trayal against the Western-backed Gulf states.</p>
    <p>At least 15 rock­ets were launched from the Gaza Strip be­tween 8pm Tues­day and early yes­ter­day, nine of which were in­ter­cepted by Is­raeli air de­fences, the mil­i­tary said.</p>
    <p>One hit the south­ern port city of Ash­dod, wound­ing at least two peo­ple, emer­gency ser­vices said.</p>
    <p>The Is­raeli mil­i­tary said fighter jets re­sponded with strikes on Ha­mas mil­i­tary tar­gets.</p>
    <p>There was no im­me­di­ate claim of re­spon­si­bil­ity for the rocket fire.</p>
    <p>But Is­rael held Ha­mas re­spon­si­ble, warn­ing it would “bear the con­se­quences for ter­ror ac­tiv­ity against Is­raeli civil­ians”.</p>
    <p>The rocket fire came as the UAE and Bahrain signed ac­cords es­tab­lish­ing di­plo­matic re­la­tions with Is­rael, and Mr Ne­tanyahu ac­cused the mil­i­tants of seek­ing to de­rail them.</p>
    <p>“They want to pre­vent peace, they won’t. We will hit ev­ery­one who tries to harm us, and we will ex­tend a hand of peace to all who reach out to us to make peace,” the Is­raeli leader said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The land­mark agree­ments prompted demon­stra­tions on Tues­day in both Gaza and the oc­cu­pied West Bank.</p>
    <p>Clutch­ing Pales­tinian flags and wear­ing blue face masks for pro­tec­tion against the coro­n­avirus, demon­stra­tors ral­lied in the West Bank cities of Nablus, He­bron and Ramallah, seat of the Pales­tinian Author­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said the agree­ments “will serve as the foun­da­tion for a com­pre­hen­sive peace across the en­tire re­gion”. “After decades of di­vi­sion and con­flict, we mark the dawn of a new Mid­dle East,” he said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing later to re­porters, he said Is­rael would en­ter into sim­i­lar deals with up to nine other coun­tries, in­clud­ing re­gional power Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>Pales­tinian Pres­i­dent Mah­moud Ab­bas warned that the deals would “not achieve peace in the re­gion” un­til the US and Is­rael ac­knowl­edged his peo­ple’s right to a state.</p>
    <p>Is­rael’s arch-foe Iran said the UAE and Bahrain were reach­ing out to a regime that is “com­mit­ting more crimes in Pales­tine ev­ery day”.</p>
    <p>“Some of the re­gion’s coun­tries, their peo­ple are pious Mus­lims but their rulers un­der­stand nei­ther re­li­gion nor (their) debt... to the na­tion of Pales­tine,” Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani told his Cab­i­net yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In Gaza, pro­test­ers tram­pled on and set fire to plac­ards bear­ing images of the lead­ers of Is­rael, the UAE and Bahrain.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions’ Mid­dle East en­voy Nick­o­lay Mlade­nov ar­rived in Gaza yes­ter­day for pre-sched­uled meet­ings with Ha­mas of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Ha­mas has joined the Pales­tinian Author­ity in con­demn­ing the UAE and Bahrain ac­cords as a “be­trayal” of their cause.</p>
    <p>The new rocket fire came after mil­i­tants launched rock­ets and bal­loons fit­ted with in­cen­di­ary de­vices across the bor­der through much of Au­gust, draw­ing re­tal­ia­tory Is­raeli air strikes.</p>
    <p>Late last month, the two sides re­newed an Egyp­tian-bro­kered truce un­der which Is­rael has al­lowed fi­nan­cial aid from the gas-rich state of Qatar to flow into im­pov­er­ished Gaza, which has been un­der Is­raeli block­ade since 2007.</p>
