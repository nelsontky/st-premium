    <p>Many shop­pers have not warmed up to the Christmas light-up and mall dec­o­ra­tions in Or­chard Road this year, with some be­moan­ing that they fall short of the year-end spec­ta­cle which Sin­ga­pore’s premier shop­ping belt is known for.</p>
    <p>But oth­ers ap­pre­ci­ate the nofrills look and sim­ple dec­o­ra­tions amid the pan­demic, which has hit re­tail­ers hard, forc­ing them to cut back on fes­tive trim­mings.</p>
    <p>Or­chard Road has also done away with street-level activities such as pop-up stores and per­for­mances, ow­ing in part to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>For some shop­pers like Ms Vi­vian Ma, the lights are not cap­ti­vat­ing enough to tempt her to the shop­ping street.</p>
    <p>Ms Ma, 30, a cus­tomer ser­vice ad­viser, said she would not ven­ture there even to take pho­tos of the lights if she were not work­ing in the area.</p>
    <p>While she likes the gold and white baubles dan­gling from the trees, she de­scribed the light-up as “hastily put to­gether” and the blue-and-white colour theme as</p>
    <p>“mis­matched”.</p>
    <p>In the “sim­ple is bet­ter” camp are some shop­pers like Mr Sa­muel Ang, 18, who finds this year’s dec­o­ra­tions “less com­mer­cialised” than the Dis­ney-themed light-up two years ago.</p>
    <p>But com­par­ing it with the Deep­avali light-up in Lit­tle In­dia, the stu­dent said Or­chard Road’s is not as vi­brant.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, the Or­chard Road Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion said yes­ter­day: “While we un­der­stand that good de­sign is sub­jec­tive, we are heart­ened to know it has brought fes­tive cheer to most, es­pe­cially now, when the na­tion is tack­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Mr Amos Tan, se­nior lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness, said a re­luc­tance to be seen as “over­spend­ing in dif­fi­cult times” could have de­terred Or­chard Road re­tail­ers from splurg­ing on fes­tive dec­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>This is also ev­i­dent in light-ups else­where – the Lit­tle In­dia Shop­keep­ers and Her­itage As­so­ci­a­tion (Lisha) cut the bud­get for the Deep­avali light-up and re­lated activities by 30 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jaku­mar Chan­dra, Lisha’s chair­man, said that fund­ing for the</p>
    <p>light-up in Lit­tle In­dia came from the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board, part­ners of Lisha, and the busi­nesses that are part of the as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Due to Covid-19, our mem­bers were not able to con­trib­ute as much money as be­fore... We are, how­ever, not com­pro­mis­ing on the ex­pe­ri­ence,” he said.</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales have taken a beat­ing this year, with the lat­est gov­ern­ment fig­ures show­ing that for the eight months since Fe­bru­ary, monthly re­tail sales, ex­clud­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles, were down from a year ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Lu­cas Tok, dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing and brand­ing lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic, said that malls may also be hold­ing back due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures which limit the num­ber of peo­ple within re­tail out­lets and din­ing es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>“Even if they go all out to spend,</p>
    <p>the re­turn is not guar­an­teed (given the lim­i­ta­tions),” he said.</p>
    <p>A mall dec­o­ra­tor who de­clined to be named let on that in pre­vi­ous years, Or­chard Road malls would have en­gaged his com­pany’s de­sign ser­vices by June, but this year, some of them did so only last month.</p>
    <p>“With Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing stag­gered in phases, many of the malls were un­cer­tain about when they could wel­come shop­pers back again and how strict safe dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions would be,” he added.</p>
    <p>The short con­tract no­tice also means that his com­pany has less time to set up the dec­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“Even now, some malls have yet to put up their Christmas dec­o­ra­tions com­pletely,” he said.</p>
