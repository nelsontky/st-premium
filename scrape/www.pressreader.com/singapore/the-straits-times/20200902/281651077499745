    <p>Com­pa­nies which vol­un­tar­ily pay pro­gres­sive wages and pro­vide job ad­vance­ment path­ways for low­er­in­come work­ers will be recog­nised with a Pro­gres­sive Wage Model (PWM) Mark, as part of ef­forts to lift wages for lower-in­come work­ers, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sec­tors such as food ser­vices and re­tail trade have the po­ten­tial to come on board, which would ex­pand the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the PWM – which she de­scribed as a “min­i­mum wage plus” – be­yond the three sec­tors where it is cur­rently man­dated: clean­ing, se­cu­rity and land­scap­ing.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, Mrs Teo said that for the PWM Mark to work, there must be a broader move­ment in­volv­ing the en­tire so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“As con­sumers, we must be pre­pared to pay slightly more, and in­ten­tion­ally sup­port such pro­gres­sive com­pa­nies by pur­chas­ing their prod­ucts and ser­vices. This will spur more com­pa­nies to be pro­gres­sive and adopt the PWM Mark, which in turn will ben­e­fit our lower-in­come work­ers,” she said.</p>
    <p>The PWM, pi­o­neered by the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) in 2012, sets out min­i­mum pay and train­ing re­quire­ments for work­ers at dif­fer­ent skill lev­els and cov­ers some 80,000 work­ers across three sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing ear­lier yes­ter­day, NTUC deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral Koh Poh Koon high­lighted that ef­forts taken by the tri­par­tite part­ners be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic will lead to the PWM be­com­ing manda­tory for the lifts and es­ca­la­tor main­te­nance sec­tor. It will take ef­fect in 2022.</p>
    <p>The labour move­ment is also in dis­cus­sions to see how the model can be im­ple­mented for the waste man­age­ment sec­tor, he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh, who is also Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health, called for greater reg­u­la­tion, adding that wait­ing for the mar­ket to move on its own will not pro­duce re­sults. “In mov­ing to­wards a univer­sal PWM, we should ex­plore setting a sec­toral wage bench­mark for com­pa­nies as a first step in sec­tors where there are cur­rently no reg­u­la­tory levers to man­date a PWM,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sec­toral wage bench­marks may get more com­pa­nies in sec­tors with a more var­ie­gated em­ploy­ment land­scape, such as food ser­vices and re­tail, to up­lift the liveli­hoods of low-wage work­ers, Dr Koh noted.</p>
    <p>Both Mrs Teo and Dr Koh ac­knowl­edged that it is not the best time to raise wages, given the cur­rent global health and eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Tim­ing is im­por­tant. We do not want to put busi­nesses out of ac­tion through es­ca­lat­ing wage costs in an eco­nomic down­turn, nor do we want to de­ter hir­ing of work­ers in a dis­tressed job mar­ket with ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment rate,” Dr Koh said. “Even as we en­deav­our to help lowwage work­ers, we must make sure a bal­ance is struck, so that ‘low-wage’ does not be­come ‘no-wage’.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that while it may be risky to man­date the model in more sec­tors at present, the Govern­ment can still pro­mote its vol­un­tary adop­tion, which is the ra­tio­nale be­hind the in­tro­duc­tion of the PWM Mark in col­lab­o­ra­tion with tri­par­tite part­ners.</p>
    <p>She noted that the Govern­ment has com­ple­mented the PWM with Work­fare ben­e­fits and skills train­ing for low-wage work­ers.</p>
    <p>Work­ers in the three sec­tors where the PWM is manda­tory have seen cu­mu­la­tive wage growth of around 30 per cent in the last five years, com­pared with the me­dian cu­mu­la­tive wage growth of 21 per cent.</p>
    <p>But there is scope for ex­pan­sion, Dr Koh said, as the sec­tors where</p>
    <p>PWM is man­dated rep­re­sent 15 per cent of all the work­ers in the low­est 20th per­centile of salary ranges.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore should lever­age skills lad­ders mapped out by Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore to move to­wards a univer­sal PWM across all lower-pay­ing job roles, he said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that in other sec­tors that are not cov­ered by the model, Work­fare and the Spe­cial Em­ploy­ment Credit have also raised wages.</p>
    <p>She out­lined the four prongs of the Govern­ment’s pre­ferred ap­proach to up­lift low-wage work­ers: reg­u­larly ad­just Work­fare; raise wages in PWM sec­tors at an ap­pro­pri­ate pace; ex­pand PWM over time to more sec­tors; and raise stan­dards of liv­ing for lower-in­come work­ers through ways such as ac­quir­ing skills, home own­er­ship and ac­cess to qual­ity health­care and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>This ap­proach has been sup­ported through mea­sures such as ex­panded Work­fare cov­er­age and higher pay­outs in­tro­duced this year, and a Work­fare spe­cial pay­ment of $3,000 to cush­ion the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic, added Mrs Teo.</p>
