    <p>As US troops pull out of Ger­many, a look back at the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel sug­gests per­sonal an­i­mos­ity was one fac­tor driv­ing the de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in the strate­gic part­ner­ship be­tween their two coun­tries, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal (be­low).</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Even by the er­ratic stan­dards of the cur­rent United States ad­min­is­tra­tion, Washington’s de­ci­sion to with­draw al­most 12,000 Amer­i­can troops sta­tioned in Ger­many is a shock.</p>
    <p>For although only about half of the Amer­i­can sol­diers will ac­tu­ally re­turn to US soil (the rest will be re­de­ployed to other Euro­pean states), the de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in the strate­gic part­ner­ship be­tween the US and Ger­many – Europe’s big­gest state – is guar­an­teed to have a pro­foundly cor­ro­sive ef­fect on the con­ti­nent’s over­all se­cu­rity ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Most of the blame for this sad out­come must un­doubt­edly rest on the shoul­ders of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, and his sin­gu­lar ob­ses­sion with crit­i­cis­ing Ger­many. But some of the blame for this cat­a­strophic col­lapse in re­la­tions can also be at­trib­uted to Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel, who nei­ther worked hard enough to limit transat­lantic an­i­mos­ity, nor suc­ceeded in shield­ing the rest of Europe from the con­se­quences of her in­creas­ingly per­sonal spat with the US Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The story of the de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in US-Ger­man re­la­tions is a cau­tion­ary tale about the lim­i­ta­tions of Ber­lin’s abil­i­ties to rise to its re­spon­si­bil­i­ties as Europe’s sin­gle big­gest ac­tor. And, as is of­ten the case when big in­ter­na­tional ac­tors bicker, the ac­tual losers from this episode are the smaller Euro­pean coun­tries whose se­cu­rity is im­per­illed.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s un­remit­tingly hos­tile ap­proach to Ger­many in gen­eral, and to its Chan­cel­lor in par­tic­u­lar, was ev­i­dent well be­fore he won the White House. In De­cem­ber 2015, for in­stance, when Time mag­a­zine named Dr Merkel as its Per­son of the Year, an in­fu­ri­ated Mr Trump – then just one of many pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates – pub­licly vented his fury against not only the mag­a­zine, but also “the per­son who is ru­in­ing Ger­many”, as he put it.</p>
    <p>In their first en­counter at the White House in early 2017, Mr Trump fa­mously failed to shake Dr Merkel’s out­stretched hand; the af­front, in the full flash­lights of the me­dia, seemed de­lib­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Worse was to fol­low. At a sum­mit of Nato, the US-led mil­i­tary al­liance in Europe, Mr Trump rudely fin­gered Chan­cel­lor Merkel with a shout of “You, An­gela!”. And, ap­par­ently, he sel­dom missed an op­por­tu­nity to crit­i­cise Ger­many to any for­eign leader he en­coun­tered.</p>
    <p>Two prob­lems seem to ob­sess Pres­i­dent Trump when it comes to Ger­many: the coun­try’s ap­par­ent suc­cess in sell­ing Ger­man cars at the al­leged ex­pense of Amer­i­can car man­u­fac­tur­ers, and Ger­many’s fail­ure to pay what Mr Trump deems as its “fair share” for the de­fence of Europe.</p>
    <p>Much of what Mr Trump be­lieves is not sup­ported by facts. Ger­many does en­joy a sur­plus in its trade with the US, but many im­ports from Ger­many are in­vest­ment goods such as cap­i­tal equip­ment, en­abling US pro­duc­tion and ex­ports, so the trade pic­ture is more bal­anced than Mr Trump would have us be­lieve.</p>
    <p>And when it comes to de­fence mat­ters, Mr Trump’s ex­ag­ger­a­tions about Ger­many’s al­leged sins are by now leg­endary.</p>
    <p>He seems to be ob­sessed with the fact that Ger­many is not meet­ing the Nato com­mit­ment to spend 2 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) on its mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>“Ger­many’s delin­quent,” Mr Trump told re­porters over the week­end, try­ing to ex­plain his de­ci­sion to with­draw troops from Ger­man soil. He added: “They haven’t paid their fees; they haven’t paid their Nato fees. They are at 1 per cent (of GDP) and they should be at 2 per cent.”</p>
    <p>The claim con­tains two ma­jor un­truths in one sen­tence. There is no “fee” to be paid for mem­ber­ship in the Nato mil­i­tary al­liance; each mem­ber state con­trib­utes as best as it can. And although Ger­many is not al­lo­cat­ing 2 per cent of its GDP to de­fence, it is spend­ing not 1 per cent, but 1.5 per cent of GDP on its mil­i­tary, and its de­fence bud­gets have gone up by an im­pres­sive 45 per cent in vol­ume terms since Mr Trump has been in of­fice.</p>
    <p>For years, an­a­lysts have tried to work out why Mr Trump is so set against Chan­cel­lor Merkel. The crud­est ex­pla­na­tion is that the Amer­i­can Pres­i­dent sim­ply con­sid­ers all women as good for only thing, and that ain’t pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>But that is prob­a­bly only part of the story. For in re­al­ity, Mr Trump’s anger with the Ger­mans may have been formed by his broader dis­taste for in­dus­trial na­tions that are com­pet­i­tive in global mar­kets – Mr Trump views them all as en­e­mies just wait­ing to “take ad­van­tage” of the US – as well as by Ger­many’s very open ad­vo­cacy for glob­al­i­sa­tion and mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions, con­cepts that run counter to ev­ery­thing Mr Trump be­lieves in.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, it was clear from the start of Mr Trump’s pres­i­dency that there would be se­vere lim­i­ta­tions to US-Ger­man re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>MERKEL’S AC­TIONS ON TRUMP</p>
    <p>But that does not en­tirely ab­solve Chan­cel­lor Merkel from shar­ing some re­spon­si­bil­ity for the cur­rent break­down in re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Like the rest of the world, the Ger­mans were stunned by Mr Trump’s 2016 elec­toral vic­tory. But while other world lead­ers scram­bled the day af­ter the Amer­i­can vote to es­tab­lish con­tact with the pres­i­dent-elect, with Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe fa­mously turn­ing around his plane in mid-flight to visit Mr Trump, Dr Merkel opted in­stead to send Mr Trump a let­ter con­tain­ing a long list of con­di­tions that the new pres­i­dent was ex­pected to ful­fil if he wanted to keep good re­la­tions with Ger­many.</p>
    <p>The let­ter was pre­dictably hailed by Amer­ica’s lib­eral press and by most Euro­peans as a mas­ter­stroke. But its con­tents would have been of­fen­sive to any in­com­ing US pres­i­dent, let alone the fa­mously thin-skinned Mr Trump. Was it wise to in­fu­ri­ate a pres­i­dent-elect? Was it wise to lay down con­di­tions to a re­la­tion­ship that is so crit­i­cal to Ger­many?</p>
    <p>More egre­giously still, days af­ter the 2016 US vote, Dr Merkel hosted in Ber­lin out­go­ing US pres­i­dent Barack Obama for a love­fest which was not only un­favourably no­ticed by the in­com­ing Trump team, but which also in­flu­enced the en­tire sub­se­quent Ger­man ap­proach to Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>For Dr Merkel read­ily bought into Mr Obama’s ex­pla­na­tion that Mr Trump’s elec­toral vic­tory was part of a broader lurch to the far right, which also in­cluded the vote in Bri­tain to leave the Euro­pean Union, and that the world can now be “saved” only by the Ger­man Chan­cel­lor’s ac­tion.</p>
    <p>That was non­sense at every level. Bri­tain’s Brexit vote had noth­ing to do with Mr Trump. And Bri­tain’s politi­cians were as trou­bled by Mr Trump’s win as Ger­many’s politi­cians were. Fur­ther­more, if Dr Merkel wanted to de­fend “Euro­pean val­ues” – as she put it – she should have con­sulted the rest of the Euro­peans. But she did not; she, as much as Mr Trump, per­son­alised her con­fronta­tion with Washington.</p>
    <p>Per­sonal slights against Mr Trump abounded. At the Group of Seven (G-7) sum­mit of most in­dus­tri­alised states in June 2018, Ger­man of­fi­cials pur­posely re­leased a photo show­ing Dr Merkel as head of a pack of lead­ers, con­fronting Pres­i­dent Trump, cor­nered and iso­lated. The pic­ture be­came an in­stant suc­cess, hailed by the me­dia around the world as a sym­bol of Euro­pean de­fi­ance.</p>
    <p>Only that it was stage-man­aged with the de­lib­er­ate in­tent of show­ing Mr Trump in the worst of lights; other pic­tures taken from other an­gles at the same time pro­vided a com­pletely dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive. The re­sult? The</p>
    <p>2018 sum­mit of the G-7 be­came the first one ever to fail to even reach a com­mu­nique.</p>
    <p>And then, there was the other oc­ca­sion when Pres­i­dent Trump mused in the pres­ence of Chan­cel­lor Merkel that he him­self is part-Ger­man. This is true, although it is equally true that his fa­ther, Fred Trump, had tried to deny his Ger­man her­itage and claimed to be Swedish, a false­hood that his son Don­ald con­tin­ued to re­peat for years.</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, Mr Trump’s claim could have been an olive branch, an at­tempt to re-en­gage with Ger­many. But what was Chan­cel­lor Merkel’s re­sponse?</p>
    <p>She burst into laugh­ter in front of the US Pres­i­dent and TV cam­eras, as though Mr Trump had just claimed to be a Mar­tian.</p>
    <p>On their own, none of th­ese episodes – and there were many more – would have changed the sit­u­a­tion. But when taken to­gether, they ren­dered an al­ready bad sit­u­a­tion far worse.</p>
    <p>TRUTHS IN TRUMP’S CLAIMS</p>
    <p>And they also ob­scured the ba­sic fact that, although Mr Trump’s be­hav­iour was of­ten boor­ish and his claims ex­ag­ger­ated, the re­al­ity is that much of his crit­i­cism of Ger­many is true.</p>
    <p>It is a fact that, for decades, the Ger­mans have un­der­spent on their de­fence and have re­sisted claims from sev­eral US pres­i­dents to in­crease their ex­pen­di­ture.</p>
    <p>It is a fact that, while the US is the ul­ti­mate guar­an­tor of Ger­many’s se­cu­rity by de­ploy­ing tens of thou­sands of troops on Ger­man soil, all opin­ion polls in­di­cate that – uniquely in Europe – or­di­nary Ger­mans weirdly re­gard Amer­i­can power as a big­ger threat to their se­cu­rity than ei­ther Rus­sia or China, and that Chan­cel­lor Merkel has done next to noth­ing to con­front this anti-Amer­i­can trend.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, it is also a fact that, while de­mand­ing that the US stands firm against Moscow, Dr Merkel is also sup­port­ing a big gas pipe­line project with Rus­sia that will make Ger­many de­pen­dent on Rus­sian en­ergy prod­ucts for decades to come. This project is op­posed by all the East Euro­pean na­tions, but the same Chan­cel­lor who never ceases to urge Euro­pean unity has brushed all th­ese crit­ics aside.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel was not dealt an easy task; Mr Trump came into of­fice dis­lik­ing her, and de­test­ing all she stood for. It is Mr Trump, and not Dr Merkel, who must be largely blamed for what tran­spired.</p>
    <p>Still, the Ger­man Chan­cel­lor had a duty to do ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble to at­ten­u­ate the in­evitable down­turn in transat­lantic re­la­tions. And in this re­spect, she failed lamentably.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, this is a fail­ure not only for Ger­many it­self, but also for the rest of Europe. For if the US com­mit­ment to the con­ti­nent di­min­ishes, the first to suf­fer will not be the Ger­mans, but the East Euro­peans who are near­est to Rus­sia, and are fre­quently sub­jected to Rus­sian threats.</p>
    <p>In short, Dr Merkel failed to up­hold her own claims to speak for Europe’s wider in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>It may be tempt­ing to sug­gest that, should Mr Joe Bi­den be elected US pres­i­dent, mat­ters could re­turn to nor­mal. But it is no­tice­able that while Mr Bi­den’s clos­est ad­vis­ers crit­i­cised</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump’s draw­down of troops from Europe, not one of them sug­gested that, should the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent end up in the White House, th­ese draw­downs will be re­versed.</p>
