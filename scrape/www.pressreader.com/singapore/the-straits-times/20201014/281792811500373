    <p>When Mr Ul­lah Ke­fayet was bat­tling Covid-19 in the in­ten­sive care unit at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases in May, his fam­ily thought they had lost him.</p>
    <p>“My fam­ily thought I had died al­ready,” he told re­porters in a brief video chat yesterday.</p>
    <p>Hooked up to a ven­ti­la­tor and in a co­matose state then, the 39-yearold de­liv­ery driver was in no con­di­tion to con­tact his wife and nineyear-old son back in Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, that lasted just four days. But, it was a rare com­pli­ca­tion that he de­vel­oped be­fore he was ad­mit­ted to ICU that took his doc­tors by sur­prise. He ex­pe­ri­enced acute pain in his right foot and de­vel­oped early gan­grene in three toes on that foot.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors found that it was due to a throm­bus, or blood clot, in his aorta, the main artery car­ry­ing blood from the heart to the rest of the body.</p>
    <p>They quickly op­er­ated on him, in­sert­ing a per­ma­nent aor­tic stent via his groin. Three months later, his gan­grene fully van­ished and he could walk prop­erly again.</p>
    <p>“It’s very rare for a blood clot to de­velop in the aorta, which is a high-flow blood ves­sel,” said Ad­junct As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Glenn Tan, head of gen­eral surgery and a se­nior con­sul­tant at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal (TTSH).</p>
    <p>It was all the more sur­pris­ing as Mr Ke­fayet, who was ad­mit­ted for short­ness of breath and fever, had no un­der­ly­ing ill­ness, Prof Tan said at a press con­fer­ence yesterday.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have shown that there is a high risk of se­verely ill Covid-19 pa­tients de­vel­op­ing sticky blood and blood clots that can lead to strokes, heart at­tacks and other life-threat­en­ing com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>This is but one of the many ways Covid-19, ini­tially viewed as a seem­ingly sim­ple res­pi­ra­tory dis­ease, can harm the body.</p>
    <p>But it is not clear why some Covid-19 pa­tients have blood clots.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said one likely cause is that Covid-19 causes se­vere in­flam­ma­tion in some pa­tients. This boosts the pro­duc­tion of cy­tokine (pro­teins pro­duced by im­mune cells), which can lead to the for­ma­tion of blood clots.</p>
    <p>Another cause could be some dam­age to the blood ves­sel wall re­sult­ing in a higher risk of clot for­ma­tion, he said, adding that it is not com­mon to see Covid-19 pa­tients here de­vel­op­ing blood clots, pos­si­bly as most of them are rel­a­tively young and healthy.</p>
    <p>He and other ex­perts, in­clud­ing Ad­junct As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Pua Uei, a se­nior con­sul­tant at TTSH’s diagnostic ra­di­ol­ogy (clin­i­cal) depart­ment who treated Mr Ke­fayet, pub­lished a pa­per on the treat­ment of ar­te­rial blood clots in Covid-19 pa­tients in the Bri­tish Jour­nal of Surgery in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said: “A few stud­ies showed that some peo­ple had re­cur­rent blood clots in the legs... and my first sus­pi­cion was that there were ac­tu­ally clots in the aorta that were not recog­nised at that time. It’s im­por­tant to look for the source.</p>
    <p>“It’s very un­usual for young peo­ple to have gan­grene in their legs when they do not have any other med­i­cal prob­lems like di­a­betes, so we wanted to see whether there were other causes.”</p>
    <p>So a scan of Mr Ke­fayet’s leg was fol­lowed by a scan of his aorta. That was when doc­tors found the source of his prob­lem and dis­cov­ered that aor­tic clots were break­ing off from his aorta and go­ing into not only his right leg but also the spleen and kid­neys. “If we had left the clots alone, they would prob­a­bly have started trav­el­ling to his left leg and go­ing into his in­testi­nal blood ves­sels,” said Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>With­out the timely surgery, Mr Ke­fayet could have lost his toes, and pos­si­bly his legs.</p>
