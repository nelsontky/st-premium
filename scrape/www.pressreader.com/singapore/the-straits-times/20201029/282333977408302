    <p>What has tra­di­tion­ally been a night of pomp and cel­e­bra­tion for the sports fra­ter­nity was given a Covid-19 twist yes­ter­day, as the Sin­ga­pore Sports Awards sported a new look ow­ing to safety rules dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The glitzy ho­tel ball­room was swopped for the Sport Sin­ga­pore au­di­to­rium, with at­ten­dees lim­ited to only award nom­i­nees and se­lected guests such as Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong.</p>
    <p>In keep­ing with so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, nom­i­nees were seated 1m apart in a sep­a­rate wait­ing area and could only en­ter the main hall when the win­ner of the cat­e­gory was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony was also livestream­ed on Face­book and YouTube.</p>
    <p>But even as cel­e­bra­tions were muted for Sin­ga­pore sport’s big­gest night, there was still much to cheer about as vet­eran ath­letes Peter Gilchrist (cue sports) and Cherie Tan (bowl­ing) won the Sports­man of the Year and Sportswoma­n of the Year ac­co­lades.</p>
    <p>Bil­liards world cham­pion Gilchrist, 52, said win­ning his sec­ond Sports­man gong af­ter his first in 2014 was a “dream come true”.</p>
    <p>Olympic cham­pion Joseph School­ing had won the last five edi­tions of the award af­ter Gilchrist’s win six years ago.</p>
    <p>Mid­dles­brough-born Gilchrist was re­warded for an ex­cel­lent per­for­mance last year when he claimed his sixth world ti­tle and sixth con­sec­u­tive English bil­liards sin­gles gold at the 2019 SEA Games.</p>
    <p>While Gilchrist lamented a “to­tally dif­fer­ent” awards cer­e­mony, he said: “I hope that in years to come, we can look back at this and have a bit of a laugh about it.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully it’s a one-off (thing) be­cause it’s re­ally nice when we’re all to­gether hav­ing din­ner and hav­ing a good time.”</p>
    <p>Like many of his fel­low ath­letes, he is “rar­ing to go” af­ter a virus-en­forced hia­tus as he tar­gets a sev­enth world ti­tle and SEA Games gold next year.</p>
    <p>First-time win­ner Tan also had a stel­lar sea­son that saw her be­come the first Asian to win the women’s Mas­ters tro­phy at the 2019 World Bowl­ing Women’s Cham­pi­onships. The 32-year-old was also the first Asian to win the Qu­bi­caAMF PWBA Play­ers Cham­pi­onship ti­tle and was part of the gold-medal win­ning team at the SEA Games.</p>
    <p>“2019 was a fan­tas­tic year for me and I’m sure I’ll re­mem­ber it in time to come,” she said.</p>
    <p>“There’s def­i­nitely dis­ap­point­ment that we can’t carry for­ward the mo­men­tum but at the end of the day, we still need a break to re­set and get go­ing for the next year.”</p>
    <p>Mile­stones were also achieved for young ath­letes Koen Pang (ta­ble ten­nis) and fencer Amita Berthier, who won the Sports­boy and Sports­girl awards for their achievemen­ts last year.</p>
    <p>Pang, who is in na­tional ser­vice, is the first ta­ble ten­nis player to win the accolade.</p>
    <p>He said: “Last year was re­ally a won­der­ful year for me as I’ve been play­ing re­ally well through­out 2019. I’m re­ally happy to have won this award.”</p>
    <p>World No. 59 women’s foil fencer Berthier, 19, had pre­vi­ously been nom­i­nated two years in a row, be­fore win­ning on her third try.</p>
    <p>“It is a tes­ta­ment to all who be­lieve in my abil­i­ties and who are in this jour­ney with me,” said Berthier from the United States, where she is study­ing at the Univer­sity of Notre Dame.</p>
    <p>NOT THE NORM</p>
    <p>I hope that in years to come, we can look back at this and have a bit of a laugh about it.</p>

    <p>UN­FOR­GET­TABLE</p>
    <p>2019 was a fan­tas­tic year for me and I’m sure I’ll re­mem­ber it in time to come.</p>
