    <p>When Covid-19 hit Sin­ga­pore last Jan­uary, there was a lot of fear sur­round­ing the highly in­fec­tious virus. De­spite the un­cer­tainty, Mr Muham­mad Afiq Roslim, 29, a staff nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal ( TTSH), took his four-month de­ploy­ment at the Na­tional Cen­tre of In­fec­tious Dis­eases’ screen­ing cen­tre in his stride.</p>
    <p>He says: “I felt a sense of duty (be­ing sta­tioned) there. There was a tinge of fear — but it was more of the un­known, rather than of con­tract­ing the virus.”</p>
    <p>Mr Afiq, who pre­vi­ously cared for pa­tients with heart and pul­monary con­di­tions, had to nim­bly switch gears to keep up as in­fec­tions soared from Jan­uary to April. His tasks ranged from reg­is­tra­tion to run­ning elec­tro­car­dio­gram screen­ings to con­duct­ing swab tests — all while wear­ing per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, com­plete with masks and gog­gles.</p>
    <p>He says: “It was dif­fi­cult to see through the gog­gles as they would get foggy. I also had to lis­ten care­fully to pa­tients and as­sure them, even though I could not see their fa­cial ex­pres­sions clearly.”</p>
    <p>An­other chal­lenge was man­ag­ing the high vol­ume of pa­tients who turned up for tests, many of whom were very anx­ious. So it was up to Mr Afiq to try to alle</p>
    <p>I felt a sense of duty (be­ing sta­tioned) there. There was a tinge of fear — but it was more of the un­known, rather than of con­tract­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Afiq Roslim, staff nurse , Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal</p>
    <p>vi­ate their fears. “The ex­pe­ri­ence has re­minded me to have more com­pas­sion and taught me how to em­pathise with the sick.”</p>
    <p>Call of duty</p>
    <p>Mr Afiq’s strong sense of em­pa­thy served him well as a com­bat medic dur­ing his na­tional ser­vice days. In Brunei, he par­tic­i­pated in an ur­gent med­i­cal sup­port ex­er­cise, which mo­ti­vated him to pur­sue a</p>
    <p>Diploma in Nurs­ing at Nanyang Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>In 2015, he re­ceived MOH Hold­ings’ Health­care Merit Award, which spon­sored his bach­e­lor’s de­gree in Health Sci­ences (Nurs­ing) jointly of­fered by The Univer­sity of Manch­ester and Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Mr Afiq says be­ing a schol­ar­ship holder taught him how to be a leader and men­tor to his nurs­ing peers. It also mo­ti­vated him to con­stantly up­grade his skills.</p>
    <p>Since join­ing TTSH in 2017, he has gone be­yond the call of duty by con­tribut­ing to build­ing TTSH’s In­te­grated Care Hub. He is also part of the hos­pi­tal’s nurs­ing pro­cure­ment team.</p>
    <p>And the learn­ing does not stop there. This year, Mr Afiq has plans to pur­sue an Ad­vanced Diploma in Nurs­ing (Med­i­cal-Sur­gi­cal), which will pave the way for him to be part of TTSH’s re­search com­mu­nity and aim for a chance to at­tend the Nurs­ing Re­search Men­tor­ship Pro­gramme.</p>
