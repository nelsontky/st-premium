    <p>GDY­NIA (Poland) Kenyan Peres Jepchirchi­r low­ered her own world record for an all-women’s half marathon at the world cham­pi­onships in Gdy­nia yes­ter­day but se­rial record-breaker Joshua Chep­tegei missed out on a medal in the men’s race.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old Jepchirchi­r, who also won world half marathon gold in 2016, pro­duced a fi­nal sprint to take the women’s ti­tle in 1hr 5min 16sec. That bet­tered the pre­vi­ous best of 1:05:34 set by Jepchirchi­r her­self in Prague on Sept 5.</p>
    <p>She came home just two sec­onds clear of Ger­many’s Me­lat Yisak Ke­jeta, who smashed the Euro­pean women-only record to take sil­ver in 1:05:18, with Ethiopia’s Yalemz­erf Ye­hualaw a fur­ther sec­ond be­hind.</p>
    <p>“It’s un­be­liev­able. My goal was to win this race,” Jepchirchi­r said. “I did not ex­pect that I would beat the world record, but I re­alised that it could hap­pen when we passed 20km.</p>
    <p>“It was a lit­tle bit windy, but the course was good for me.”</p>
    <p>On a cold and windy morn­ing, a group of favourites broke away early dur­ing the four-lap race but three of them had falls to dis­ap­pear from con­tention.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing cham­pion Net­sanet Gudeta’s race al­most came to an abrupt stop as the lead­ers took a 90-de­gree turn onto the seafront, where she fell and lost sev­eral sec­onds to the lead­ers.</p>
    <p>It was a gap she would never close, the Ethiopian slip­ping far­ther be­hind dur­ing the third lap.</p>
    <p>Turkey’s Yasemin Can led a group of seven through 10km in 30:47 af­ter which Jepchirchi­r be­gan to take con­trol.</p>
    <p>The Ethiopian Aba­bel Ye­shaneh, world record holder in a mixed race (1:04:31), then tan­gled with Joy­ci­line Jep­kos­gei and both crashed to the ground, leav­ing Jepchirchi­r, Ke­jeta and Ye­hualaw to bat­tle it out in the fi­nal sprint.</p>
    <p>Ja­cob Ki­plimo took the men’s race in a new cham­pi­onship record of 58min 49sec but his Ugan­dan com­pa­triot Chep­tegei could only fin­ish fourth.</p>
    <p>Ki­plimo, who turns 20 next month, had never raced the 21.1 km dis­tance be­fore but he showed nerves of steel as he and the Kenyan Kibi­wott Kandie broke away from the lead­ing pack af­ter the 15km mark.</p>
    <p>The 2017 world ju­nior cross coun­try cham­pion then pushed clear in the last few me­tres to edge out Kandie by five sec­onds and se­cure his first ma­jor ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The Ethiopian Amede­work Walelegn took bronze, com­ing in an­other 14 sec­onds be­hind. Chep­tegei fin­ished fourth in 59:21, over half a minute be­hind Ki­plimo.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old had made only three out­ings this year but each time had bro­ken a world record.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary he claimed the world 5km road record in Monaco. Then,</p>
    <p>af­ter a pe­riod of coro­n­avirus lock­down at home, he re­turned to Monaco and, in his first race back, wiped al­most two sec­onds off Ke</p>
    <p>nenisa Bekele’s 16-year-old track world-record time over the 5,000m as he clocked 12:35.36.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month in Va­len­cia, he</p>
    <p>smashed Bekele’s 10,000m track world record in 26:11.00, tak­ing off over six sec­onds.</p>
