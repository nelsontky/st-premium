    <p>LON­DON • Mikel Arteta be­lieves Arsenal’s FA Cup tri­umph will be an at­trac­tive propo­si­tion for po­ten­tial sign­ings, with the next sea­son of the English Pre­mier League sched­uled to start in just un­der six weeks.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Satur­day’s 2-1 win over Chelsea in the FA Cup fi­nal, the Gun­ners had faced the pos­si­bil­ity of no Euro­pean foot­ball for the first time in 25 years af­ter their eighth-placed fin­ish in the top flight.</p>
    <p>But with an­other Europa League cam­paign to look for­ward to for the fourth con­sec­u­tive year and their record-ex­tend­ing 14th Cup suc­cess in tow, Arteta will get a big­ger trans­fer kitty.</p>
    <p>“It is a dou­ble re­ward for us, it is re­ally im­por­tant for this club in every way to be in Europe,” said the Spa­niard, who is now the first man to win the Cup for Arsenal both as a cap­tain and man­ager.</p>
    <p>“Win­ning this com­pe­ti­tion is part of our his­tory. It’s 14 now, I con­trib­uted, we all did it, so I am so happy.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer Manch­ester City as­sis­tant is also hope­ful the win will con­vince Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang that his fu­ture lies at the Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>The cap­tain scored a dou­ble, in­clud­ing a dinked fin­ish over Willy Ca­ballero at Wem­b­ley, to take his tally to 29 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Since join­ing Arsenal in Jan­uary 2018, Aubameyang has more goals (70) across all com­pe­ti­tions than any other Pre­mier League player. And af­ter the 31-year-old proved to be the dif­fer­ence-maker yet again, Arteta was asked about his con­tract sta­tus. The Gabon striker, who scored a brace against City in the semi-fi­nals, has just one year left on his deal, with spec­u­la­tion mount­ing that the Cup fi­nal may be his last ap­pear­ance in an Arsenal shirt amid in­ter­est from Euro­pean big­wigs like Barcelona.</p>
    <p>Arteta, how­ever, claimed that nowhere else would Aubameyang be more val­ued than at Arsenal.</p>
    <p>He said: “I think he wants to stay, it is about get­ting the deal done. Mo­ments like that will help to re­alise and give him be­lief we are on the right path and he is a big part of it.</p>
    <p>“He is loved by ev­ery­one at the club so hope­fully, he will con­tinue with us.”</p>
    <p>On Aubameyang’s first piece of sil­ver­ware with the club and Arsenal’s first ma­jor hon­our since the 2017 Cup, Arteta poked fun at his star man’s mishap when he dropped the tro­phy while at­tempt­ing to lift it dur­ing the post-match cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>“He needs more ex­pe­ri­ence with tro­phies. We can get him used to that.”</p>
    <p>Aubameyang paid trib­ute to Arteta, who has made a pos­i­tive im­pact since join­ing in De­cem­ber af­ter pre­de­ces­sor Unai Emery was fired in Novem­ber and a short spell by care­taker Fred­die Ljung­berg.</p>
    <p>“He de­serves this win. He did a great job and we are all happy to have him on board,” he said.</p>
    <p>But he dodged ques­tions on whether he would be com­mit­ting to the club, say­ing: “Noth­ing (de­cided). To­day is about the tro­phy.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally not think­ing about this now, I re­ally just want to en­joy with the guys. Ev­ery­one gave their best for the team to­day, we de­served it.”</p>
    <p>Arsenal’s win means Wolves, who fin­ished sev­enth in the league, will not play in the Europa League next sea­son, while Tot­ten­ham will have to go into the se­cond qual­i­fy­ing round of that com­pe­ti­tion de­spite end­ing the cam­paign in sixth spot.</p>
