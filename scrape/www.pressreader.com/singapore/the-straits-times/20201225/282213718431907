    <p>Th­ese days, the hum­ble MP3 ra­dio set gets lit­tle air time. But for some el­derly peo­ple liv­ing alone, the old­fash­ioned por­ta­ble player has been a source of so­lace dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The de­vice, which is mostly used by the el­derly, com­bines the tra­di­tional ra­dio with an MP3 player. Users can lis­ten to ei­ther the ra­dio sta­tions they like or pro­grammes loaded onto MP3 cards.</p>
    <p>Project Au­di­ble Cheer, an ini­tia­tive that be­gan in late April dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, de­liv­ers the ra­dio sets to vul­ner­a­ble se­niors.</p>
    <p>The project, started by busi­ness psy­chol­o­gist Skye Yeo, aims to pro­vide men­tal and emo­tional sup­port through the ra­dio sets.</p>
    <p>Dr Yeo, who is in her 40s, was brain­storm­ing for ways to help the el­derly liv­ing alone in rental es­tates. Th­ese peo­ple were likely to have re­duced so­cial in­ter­ac­tion dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a 2018 re­port by the Cen­tre for Age­ing Re­search & Ed­u­ca­tion, de­pres­sive symp­toms are higher among el­derly peo­ple who stay alone, com­pared with those liv­ing with their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Dr Yeo wanted to let th­ese se­niors know they were not alone.</p>
    <p>She was in­spired by her par­ents, who are in their 70s, to use mu­sic as a tool for out­reach. “My mum has al­ways been a mu­sic buff,” she said. “I also re­alised that mu­sic can be com­fort­ing to the el­derly when I saw my fa­ther turn to mu­sic when he was in his mid-70s.”</p>
    <p>She de­cided on MP3 ra­dio sets over other de­vices as they are eas­ier for the el­derly, who may not be dig­i­tally savvy, to oper­ate.</p>
    <p>The de­vices also have recharge­able bat­ter­ies, which means no re­cur­ring ex­penses for the users.</p>
    <p>She first shipped the ra­dio sets from sup­pli­ers in China to Sin­ga­pore. Vol­un­teers such as those from 3Pump­kins, a non-profit arts com­pany, then helped to preload pro­grammes cre­ated in Man­darin, Malay, Tamil and di­alects onto the MP3 cards.</p>
    <p>Many of th­ese songs are old tunes that res­onate with the el­derly, who just have to press the play but­ton to lis­ten.</p>
    <p>The sets are passed on to char­i­ta­ble and com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions such as Touch Com­mu­nity Ser­vices and Be Kind SG to be dis­trib­uted to their el­derly ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>Project trea­surer Kelly Kam, 44, said many of the re­cip­i­ents were happy to re­ceive the ra­dio sets.</p>
    <p>She re­called how an el­derly man broke into a dance when she pre­sented him with a set. “His face re­ally lit up.”</p>
    <p>About 700 ra­dio sets have been given out since April. Dr Yeo is now look­ing for new or­gan­i­sa­tions to dis­trib­ute 400 sets that have re­cently ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Project Au­di­ble Cheer is en­tirely vol­un­teer-run. Ms Kam said the project hopes to bring cheer into the lives of the el­derly.</p>
    <p>“We want to show that we care about their well-be­ing, so that they can re­tire hap­pily and rem­i­nisce about their yesteryear­s through mu­sic.”</p>
