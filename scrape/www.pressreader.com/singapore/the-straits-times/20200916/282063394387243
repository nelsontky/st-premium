    <p>CHENGDU • Li Tian­hui had high hopes when she signed up for a free train­ing pro­gramme for make-up artists in her neigh­bour­hood, six months after she lost her sales as­sis­tant job dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I was hav­ing trou­ble land­ing a po­si­tion be­cause of a lack of skills,” said Ms Li, a 33-year-old from Chengdu, a south-western Chi­nese city. “I thought the course could ad­dress the prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>But the 10-day pro­gramme, funded by the city gov­ern­ment, failed to help Ms Li, who strug­gled to choose the cor­rect eye shadow in a job in­ter­view a few days after the train­ing.</p>
    <p>“The course didn’t teach us mar­ketable skills,” said Ms Li, who is still search­ing for a job. “Teach­ers paid more at­ten­tion to mak­ing sure we checked in by touch­ing a fin­ger­print scan­ner be­fore en­ter­ing and after leav­ing the class­room.”</p>
    <p>She is among the more than 50 mil­lion job­less and low-in­come work­ers Bei­jing is seek­ing to re­train after the pan­demic drove up unemployme­nt and forced many work­ers to ac­cept pay cuts.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the re-ed­u­ca­tion campaign, the largest of its kind in the world’s most pop­u­lous na­tion, has done lit­tle to boost employment.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics said the pro­gramme had failed to meet the needs of the mar­ket be­cause of a lack of in­vest­ment in the ini­tia­tive as well as the in­ef­fec­tive state-dom­i­nated pro­fes­sional cer­ti­fi­ca­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“China’s gov­ern­ment-backed pro­fes­sional train­ing sys­tem is a waste of pub­lic re­sources”, said a gov­ern­ment ad­viser in Chengdu, who did not want to be named.</p>
    <p>“The job should be left to the pri­vate sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>MAS­SIVE SKILL SHORT­AGE</p>
    <p>De­spite its huge work­force, China lacks the skilled labour needed to power its in­creas­ingly so­phis­ti­cated econ­omy. The skills short­age is es­pe­cially pro­nounced among the coun­try’s 290 mil­lion mi­grant work­ers, with more than two-thirds say­ing they had no train­ing be­fore en­ter­ing the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>For un­skilled work­ers, the pan­demic has raised the threat of be­ing laid off. A study in July by Pek­ing Univer­sity found that up to 9 per cent of Chi­nese adults lost their jobs this year and have failed to find a new one, partly be­cause they lacked the re­quired train­ing.</p>
    <p>Since the out­break of the pan­demic, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist party has re­peat­edly set employment as a pri­or­ity be­cause mass lay-offs threaten so­cial sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>That prompted Bei­jing to launch a na­tion­wide campaign to re­train its work­ing and job­less adults.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Hu­man Re­sources and So­cial Se­cu­rity said in June that China would pro­vide free skills train­ing for more than 14 mil­lion mi­grant work­ers over the next two years.</p>
    <p>That fol­lowed an an­nounce­ment last year by the State Coun­cil that pledged to spend 100 bil­lion yuan (S$20 bil­lion) train­ing more than 50 mil­lion work­ers in the three years end­ing 2021.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple vo­ca­tional schools in Chengdu and sur­round­ing cities, known for their large num­ber of mi­grant job seek­ers, re­ported a surge in stu­dents for the free train­ing cour­ses that ranged from cook­ing to auto re­pair.</p>
    <p>Mr Li Zhi, the owner of a cook­ing school in the south-western city of Zigong, said en­rol­ment for sub­sidised cour­ses more than dou­bled this year to more than 1,000 from last year.</p>
    <p>“We are pros­per­ing on the back of a weak econ­omy,” he said.</p>
    <p>IN­AD­E­QUATE TRAIN­ING</p>
    <p>The train­ing boom, how­ever, has not helped many un­em­ployed work­ers find a job. In­ter­views with mul­ti­ple vo­ca­tional schools in Chengdu and neigh­bour­ing cities showed that just a frac­tion of adult stu­dents se­cured rel­e­vant jobs within three months of grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Don’t ex­pect our course to help you find good employment even when the gov­ern­ment says so,” said a di­rec­tor at Chengdu-based Sichuan Keli Vo­ca­tional School, who also wished to re­main anony­mous. His school trained more than 1,000 job­less work­ers last year.</p>
    <p>A lack of fund­ing is partly to blame for the pro­gramme’s lim­ited suc­cess. Vo­ca­tional schools said state sup­port was not nearly enough to cover the cost of teach­ing.</p>
    <p>In Du­jiangyan, a city near Chengdu, Qidi Vo­ca­tional School receives a subsidy of 800 yuan per per­son for make-up train­ing that nor­mally costs more than</p>
    <p>2,000 yuan.</p>
    <p>The gap, said Qidi principal Kang Zhongyu, meant that the school could ei­ther pro­vide well-rounded train­ing at a loss or cut cor­ners to make ends meet. The city gov­ern­ment al­lowed Qidi to trim the length of the course to 120 hours from the stan­dard 300.</p>
    <p>“Our goal is to help stu­dents learn the ba­sics rather than be­com­ing an ex­pert,” said an of­fi­cial at Du­jiangyan Hu­man Re­sources and So­cial Se­cu­rity Bureau, which over­sees the city’s skills train­ing.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has set a low bar for pro­gramme as­sess­ment, with most cour­ses is­su­ing cer­tifi­cates to stu­dents who pass a writ­ten test even when hands-on train­ing mat­ters more.</p>
    <p>At Du­jiangyan Trade School (DTS), one of the largest in the city, stu­dents of the sub­sidised cook­ing course can grad­u­ate after com­plet­ing a mul­ti­ple choice test of 30 ques­tions.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial at DTS said the gov­ern­ment grant did not cover the cost of food. “The best we can do is to test your knowl­edge of nutrition the­ory,” he said.</p>
    <p>To ad­dress the prob­lem, many cities be­gan sub­si­dis­ing stu­dents who pass the more rig­or­ous prac­tice exam. The ef­forts, how­ever, were hob­bled by a state-led skills cer­ti­fi­ca­tion sys­tem that lagged be­hind mar­ket de­mand.</p>
    <p>While pri­vate train­ers have a bet­ter idea on which skills the labour mar­ket needs, Bei­jing has been slow to open up the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers are giv­ing up on the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“All I want is some­one who can make kung pao chicken that at­tracts cus­tomers to come back,” said Chengdu restau­rant owner Zhang Lin. “A 14-day train­ing or a cer­tifi­cate won’t serve that pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>NOT VERY HELP­FUL</p>
    <p>The course didn’t teach us mar­ketable skills. Teach­ers paid more at­ten­tion to mak­ing sure we checked in by touch­ing a fin­ger­print scan­ner be­fore en­ter­ing and after leav­ing the class­room.</p>
