    <p>As Ellen DeGeneres’ (left) “Queen of Nice” per­sona goes down the drain with al­le­ga­tions of work­place tox­i­c­ity on her talk show, more peo­ple are open­ing up about their ex­pe­ri­ences work­ing with her and on the show.</p>
    <p>And they are clearly split into two camps.</p>
    <p>Last month, Buz­zfeed News pub­lished an ex­plo­sive re­port fea­tur­ing in­ter­views with former and cur­rent em­ploy­ees who al­leged a toxic work en­vi­ron­ment and sex­ual ha­rass­ment and mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>Tony Okung­bowa, a DJ on the show, is the lat­est em­ployee to speak up.</p>
    <p>“While I am grate­ful for the op­por­tu­nity it af­forded me,” he wrote on In­sta­gram, “I did ex­pe­ri­ence and feel the tox­i­c­ity of the en­vi­ron­ment and I stand with my former col­leagues in their quest to cre­ate a health­ier and more in­clu­sive work­place as the show moves for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Stand-up co­me­dian Brad Garrett tweeted last Fri­day that the re­al­i­ties on the set were “com­mon knowl­edge”, adding that he knew “more than one who were treated hor­ri­bly by her (DeGeneres)”.</p>
    <p>Back To The Fu­ture (1985) ac­tress Lea Thomp­son replied: “True story.”</p>
    <p>But sev­eral celebri­ties – most re­cently co­me­dian-ac­tor Kevin Hart and singer Katy Perry – have jumped to the de­fence of DeGeneres, 62, who last week sent an e-mail apol­o­gis­ing to staff.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Hart, 41, wrote on In­sta­gram: “It’s crazy to see my friend go thru what she’s go­ing thru pub­licly. I have known Ellen for years and I can hon­estly say that she’s one of the dopest peo­ple on the... planet. She has treated my fam­ily and team with love and re­spect from day 1.”</p>
    <p>His post was ac­com­pa­nied by a photo of him and DeGeneres smil­ing to­gether on the show.</p>
    <p>Perry, 35, also said on so­cial me­dia on Tues­day: “I know I can’t speak for any­one else’s ex­pe­ri­ence be­sides my own, but I want to ac­knowl­edge that I have only ever had pos­i­tive take­aways from my time with Ellen & on the @theel­len­show.</p>
    <p>“I think we all have wit­nessed the light & con­tin­ual fight for equal­ity that she has brought to the world through her plat­form for decades. Send­ing you love & a hug...”</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, DeGeneres’ wife, 47-year-old ac­tress Por­tia de Rossi, posted a photo of them on the show with the cap­tion, “I Stand With Ellen”.</p>
    <p>On the same day, a #Re­placeEllen hash­tag went vi­ral on Twit­ter and it was re­ported that English co­me­dian-ac­tor James Cor­den, who has his own late-night talk show, is in talks to re­place DeGeneres.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers who have ex­pressed their sup­port for DeGeneres in­clude Ar­gen­tine polo player Ig­na­cio Figueras and mu­sic mogul Scooter Braun.</p>
