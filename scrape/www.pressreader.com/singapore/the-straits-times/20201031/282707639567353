    <p>Trainer Michael Cle­ments has drawn a line through his Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Derby win­ner Top Knight’s dis­ap­point­ment in the $400,000 Group 1 Raf­fles Cup over 1,600m three weeks ago.</p>
    <p>His stable star had fin­ished a toobad-to-be-true ninth to Ara­maayo as the $12 favourite.</p>
    <p>Ara­maayo is bid­ding for his third Group 1 vic­tory, af­ter hav­ing also won the Kranji Mile on Aug 16.</p>
    <p>He rea­sons that the lack of pace was Top Knight’s un­do­ing and the 1,800m trip in to­day’s $400,000 Group 1 Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup will suit his charge. Af­ter all, the Derby was also over 1,800m.</p>
    <p>“At his last race, there was no pace in the race. It didn’t suit him when they crawled, and sprinted up late,” he said.</p>
    <p>“He can’t do that as he is not a sprinter. For him to fin­ish off his race, he needs to run off a fair pace and he can then run into the race.</p>
    <p>“This time, he will be back on his win­ning course and dis­tance, and it’ll be over the long course as well.”</p>
    <p>Cle­ments feels Top Knight has main­tained good form.</p>
    <p>“We were re­ally happy with him go­ing into the Raf­fles Cup, as we felt he was ac­tu­ally bet­ter in him­self than he was go­ing into the Derby,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We’ve given him a few strong gallops. I feel he’s at the same level he was be­fore the Raf­fles Cup, I’m re­ally happy with him. I’m re­ally look­ing for­ward to his run.”</p>
    <p>The Fal­con Rac­ing No. 7-owned eight-time win­ner will be Cle­ments’ sole QEII Cup con­tender, af­ter he de­cided not to en­ter Siam Blue Vanda for the sec­ond leg of the Sin­ga­pore Triple Crown Se­ries.</p>
    <p>The Group 2 Ste­wards’ Cup win­ner has gone off the boil this cam­paign. He fin­ished a seven-length 10th to Ara­maayo in the Raf­fles Cup.</p>
    <p>But Cle­ments is not giv­ing up com­pletely on a berth in the ul­ti­mate leg, the $1 mil­lion Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Gold Cup over 2,000m on Nov 21.</p>
    <p>“Siam Blue Vanda hasn’t been run­ning up to ex­pec­ta­tions. We de­cided to give him a short fresh­enup af­ter the Raf­fles Cup,” said the Zim­babwe-born trainer.</p>
    <p>“He took it easy for a cou­ple of weeks and is now back in work. There is still a pos­si­bil­ity we’ll run him in the Gold Cup, but we’ll have to see how he re­sponds in his prep.</p>
    <p>“There’s not much point if he doesn’t show us he can again race up to what he is ca­pa­ble of do­ing.”</p>
