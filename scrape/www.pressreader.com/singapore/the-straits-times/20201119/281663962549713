    <p>Dur­ing a coro­n­avirus out­break at a Bei­jing whole­sale mar­ket in June, the Chi­nese health au­thor­i­ties pinned the blame on im­ported salmon, pulling hun­dreds of kilo­grams of the fatty fish off su­per­mar­ket shelves and menus.</p>
    <p>This was ini­tially met with scep­ti­cism by the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity as China’s at­tempt to ex­plain away how in­fec­tions were resur­fac­ing de­spite declar­ing the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion mostly un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>But in the five months since, there has been in­creas­ing ev­i­dence that Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, can sur­vive on frozen and re­frig­er­ated food, given the right con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>There have been spo­radic out­breaks across China, mostly linked to work­ers deal­ing with cold-chain im­ported food.</p>
    <p>The coun­try said last week that it would ban food im­ports from coun­tries with coro­n­avirus out­breaks at their pro­duc­tion fa­cil­i­ties, or whose prod­ucts were found to con­tain traces of the virus.</p>
    <p>Trade part­ners have bris­tled at the re­stric­tions tar­geted at pre­vent­ing im­ports of the virus, but China’s se­vere mea­sures should not be hastily writ­ten off: Its travel bans and manda­tory mask-wear­ing ef­forts ear­lier this year have proven pre­scient.</p>
    <p>Food pro­cess­ing plants world­wide have seen coro­n­avirus out­breaks among em­ploy­ees, who of­ten work long hours in close prox­im­ity un­der hot, sweaty con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Most of the spo­radic out­breaks of Covid-19 in China were in port cities like Dalian, Qing­dao and, most re­cently, Tian­jin.</p>
    <p>When two cold-chain stor­age work­ers were in­fected in Tian­jin, a city just over an hour away by road from the cap­i­tal Bei­jing, mass test­ing was rolled out for im­ported pro­duce na­tion­wide, while state me­dia showed work­ers hos­ing down trucks with dis­in­fec­tant and in­spect­ing pack­ets of frozen food.</p>
    <p>In at least five cities, in­clud­ing Wuhan, where Covid-19 first emerged at a wet mar­ket last De­cem­ber, the au­thor­i­ties have re­ported traces of the virus on frozen im­ported food, in­clud­ing beef from Brazil, pork from Ar­gentina and cut­tle­fish from In­dia. These cities have so far not re­ported any cases of in­fec­tion linked to the food im­ports.</p>
    <p>Cus­toms in­spec­tors across China have so far tested more than 800,000 sam­ples from re­frig­er­ated im­ports and sus­pended ship­ments from 99 over­seas sup­pli­ers, se­nior</p>
    <p>Cus­toms of­fi­cial Bi Kexin told a press con­fer­ence last week.</p>
    <p>These sup­pli­ers were sin­gled out be­cause of coro­n­avirus out­breaks at their pro­cess­ing plants, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The chief epi­demi­ol­o­gist of the Chi­nese Cen­tre for Dis­ease</p>
    <p>Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion said last week that there is grow­ing ev­i­dence of the virus be­ing im­ported on frozen seafood and meat prod­ucts. “(The Bei­jing out­break) was the world’s first dis­cov­ery and con­fir­ma­tion that con­tam­i­nated food can cause new Covid-19 out­breaks in other coun­tries via cold-chain trans­porta­tion,” Dr Wu Zun­you said in an in­ter­view with the web­site of the Cen­tral Com­mis­sion for Dis­ci­pline In­spec­tion.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists from Sin­ga­pore’s Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal have also found that frozen food could cause out­breaks in re­gions where the dis­ease had been con­trolled. While their pa­per has not been peer re­viewed, the team is now look­ing into whether the virus can sur­vive on food pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>The find­ing, how­ever, con­tra­dicts guid­ance from the in­ter­na­tional health au­thor­i­ties: The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion had in April said it is “highly un­likely” that peo­ple can con­tract Covid-19 from food or food pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, ma­jor food-pro­duc­ing coun­tries are grow­ing in­creas­ingly frus­trated with China’s scru­tiny of im­ported prod­ucts and are calling on it to stop ag­gres­sive test­ing for the coro­n­avirus, which some say is tan­ta­mount to a trade re­stric­tion.</p>
    <p>The United States, Brazil and New Zealand have been ac­cused of hav­ing ex­ported food that con­tained traces of coro­n­avirus, but agri­cul­tural of­fi­cials and diplo­mats say China has not been forth­com­ing with ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the US Depart­ment of Agri­cul­ture said China’s re­stric­tions were “not based on sci­ence” and threat­ened to dis­rupt trade. In re­sponse, China said the re­stric­tions were “pro­vi­sional based on sci­en­tific ba­sis” and de­signed to “pro­tect peo­ple’s lives to the max­i­mum ex­tent”.</p>
    <p>Within China, there are also con­cerns over the im­pact of such bans on its food sup­ply chain: The coun­try has had to in­crease its pro­duce im­ports this year be­cause of swine flu and heavy flood­ing that dam­aged swathes of farm­land. Of­fi­cial data from Septem­ber showed a 70 per cent in­crease in meat im­ports.</p>
    <p>Yet, ul­ti­mately, like many as­pects of the pan­demic – in­clud­ing the virus’ ori­gin, med­i­cal sup­plies and the race for a vac­cine – there are signs of it turn­ing into a geopo­lit­i­cal is­sue.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the chief econ­o­mist of the United Na­tions food and agri­cul­ture agency, Dr Max­imo Torero Cullen, said there is no sig­nif­i­cant ev­i­dence of coro­n­avirus be­ing spread through food trade and such re­ports “need to be min­imised”.</p>
