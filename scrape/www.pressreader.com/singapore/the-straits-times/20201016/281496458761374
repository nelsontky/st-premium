    <p>Wed­nes­day evening’s power-re­lated dis­rup­tion af­fect­ing three MRT lines was the first in­ci­dent of its kind in four years.</p>
    <p>It came after a rel­a­tively un­event­ful year, ex­cept for a six-hour dis­rup­tion – also power-re­lated – which af­fected the North East Line in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The lull was a huge con­trast to the spate of break­downs which af­fected the MRT net­work with dis­turb­ing reg­u­lar­ity from 2011.</p>
    <p>The tally stands con­ser­va­tively at a dozen, or on av­er­age at least one ma­jor dis­rup­tion per year. This may sound in­signif­i­cant, but a train break­down is any­thing but.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally, each time, tens of thou­sands of peo­ple are in­con­ve­nienced di­rectly (stuck on train, anx­ious, late for ap­point­ments) and many more in­di­rectly (com­muters hav­ing to make al­ter­na­tive travel plans, traf­fic con­ges­tion, surge pric­ing).</p>
    <p>But with three out of six ma­jor re­ju­ve­na­tion plans hav­ing been com­pleted, the rail sys­tem is a lot more re­li­able than it was. To­day, one dis­rup­tion (mi­nor and ma­jor) takes place for ev­ery 1.6 mil­lion train-km trav­elled – more than 10 times the dis­tance clocked in 2015.</p>
    <p>Mean kilo­me­tres be­tween fail­ures (MKBF), al­though an in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised method of mea­sur­ing rail re­li­a­bil­ity, has its lim­i­ta­tions. Ex­perts like Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences trans­port econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira reckon there are holis­tic mea­sures, such as de­lay-min­utes per com­muter, which would be more re­flec­tive of the im­pact of each dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>This would lend grav­ity to Wed­nes­day’s three-line dis­rup­tion, which may oth­er­wise have been counted as just one in­ci­dent out of 1.6 mil­lion train-km clocked.</p>
    <p>As it took place dur­ing the evening peak, the break­down is es­ti­mated to have af­fected at least 200,000 com­muters. This takes into ac­count the fact that the bulk of trips are made dur­ing the morn­ing and evening peaks, that the in­ci­dent af­fected two most heav­ily used ra­dial lines and one or­bital line, off­set by the lower daily vol­ume brought about by Covid-19. As the dis­rup­tion took 31/ hours</p>
    <p>2 to re­solve, its sever­ity is ob­vi­ous, even with­out the maths that goes into the de­lay-minute cal­cu­la­tion</p>
    <p>Dr Th­e­seira raised.</p>
    <p>Why the re­cov­ery process took so long is one of many questions the in­ci­dent throws up. Granted, the wet weather may have made the task trick­ier for sur­face lines, but it should not have im­peded tun­nel evac­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Also, SMRT, the op­er­a­tor for all three af­fected lines, would have honed its re­cov­ery skills by now, see­ing how it was never short of prac­tice.</p>
    <p>So, it is puz­zling – and in­deed, wor­ry­ing – that the com­pany, since pri­va­tised to give it un­di­vided fo­cus on its core rail busi­ness, took so long to come to the aid of stranded pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>Another ques­tion per­tains to how the power fault hap­pened sud­denly, seem­ingly with­out warn­ing. This is quite un­char­ac­ter­is­tic, as all well-en­gi­neered sys­tems give “warn­ings”, ei­ther ac­tively or pas­sively.</p>
    <p>SMRT has said Wed­nes­day’s dis­rup­tion was trig­gered by a ca­ble in­su­la­tion fault be­tween Tuas Link and Tuas West Road sta­tions. A cir­cuit breaker in the vicin­ity should have tripped to iso­late the fault, but the cir­cuit breaker failed to work.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the en­tire North-South and East-West lines’ power sys­tem tripped.</p>
    <p>Again, this raises more questions. Tuas is the new­est stretch of the East-West Line. It opened just three years ago. That a ca­ble in­su­la­tion – which can last well over 30 years – can fail so soon points to four likely causes, none par­tic­u­larly com­fort­ing to users. Namely, poor man­u­fac­tur­ing, poor in­stal­la­tion, wrong spec­i­fi­ca­tions or dam­age by ex­ter­nal forces.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time a cir­cuit breaker has failed in the net­work. In March 2015, a faulty cir­cuit breaker, which was newly in­stalled, caused the en­tire Bukit Pan­jang LRT to shut down for a day.</p>
    <p>Cir­cuit break­ers are fairly straight­for­ward mech­a­nisms which are in place to pre­vent more se­ri­ous out­comes when some­thing goes wrong in an elec­tri­cal sys­tem. Cal­i­brated and ap­plied well, they should work flaw­lessly.</p>
    <p>What fol­lowed next sounds like hu­man er­ror. To re­store power to the North-South and East-West lines, SMRT said there was an at­tempt to draw power from Buona Vista In­take sub­sta­tion. But tech­ni­cians did this with­out first iso­lat­ing the fault, re­sult­ing in a power sup­ply dis­rup­tion to the Cir­cle Line.</p>
    <p>In April 2016, this sub­sta­tion played a cen­tral role in an un­prece­dented four-line dis­rup­tion to the net­work. Did his­tory re­peat it­self?</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s in­ci­dent is also sim­i­lar to what hap­pened five years ago. The dif­fer­ence, how­ever, was how SMRT re­acted back then. On July 7, 2015, just be­fore 7pm,</p>
    <p>SMRT de­tected re­peated power anom­alies and de­cided to shut down the North-South and East-West lines.</p>
    <p>The move was a painful one, but it pre­vented much hard­ship which com­muters stuck on trains would have faced oth­er­wise (as hap­pened on Wed­nes­day).</p>
    <p>After the July 2015 and April 2016 in­ci­dents, sev­eral mea­sures were put in place to pre­vent sim­i­lar power fail­ures. These in­clude seg­re­gat­ing the North-South and East-West lines’ power sys­tem, and “de­sen­si­tis­ing” cir­cuit break­ers by rais­ing the stray volt­age limit from 136 volts to 200 volts. Could the lat­ter be the rea­son why the cir­cuit breaker in Tuas failed to trip?</p>
    <p>Since then, there have been sev­eral other en­hance­ments made to make the sys­tem more re­silient. Re­dun­dan­cies were built in so that when some­thing fails, it will “fail softly, and fail safely” – a term of­ten ar­tic­u­lated by SMRT chair­man</p>
    <p>Seah Moon Ming.</p>
    <p>Tens of mil­lions have also been spent on con­di­tion mon­i­tor­ing. Trains are equipped with sen­sors which pick up ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties as they travel along a line so that they can be ad­dressed well be­fore they de­velop into prob­lems.</p>
    <p>That aside, SMRT has adopted a pre­ven­tive main­te­nance reg­i­men. Some 70 per cent of main­te­nance is now pre­ven­tive main­te­nance, and 30 per cent is cor­rec­tive main­te­nance. Pre­vi­ously, the ra­tio was the other way around.</p>
    <p>Pre­ven­tive main­te­nance in­volves re­plac­ing com­po­nents and sys­tems well be­fore they are worn, re­sult­ing in sig­nif­i­cantly higher ex­penses. Rail op­er­at­ing losses in re­cent years have been largely at­trib­ut­able to these ex­penses.</p>
    <p>So, it would be a real shame if all these ef­forts fail to pre­vent what they were de­signed to pre­vent – in­ci­dents which are of low oc­cur­rence, but of ex­tremely high im­pact.</p>
