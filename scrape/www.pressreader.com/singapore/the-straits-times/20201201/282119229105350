    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong is seek­ing dam­ages in the re­gion of $150,000 from blog­ger Leong Sze Hian over a li­bel­lous ar­ti­cle he shared on Face­book, with the Prime Min­is­ter’s lawyer ar­gu­ing yes­ter­day that Mr Leong had not only made “stun­ning al­le­ga­tions”, but also cyn­i­cally politi­cised the case and re­cast PM Lee’s ef­fort to vin­di­cate him­self as vic­tim­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Leong’s lawyer said his client was sin­gled out as he was a prom­i­nent critic of the Gov­ern­ment, adding that PM Lee had used the “full weight of the gov­ern­ment ma­chin­ery” to come down on Mr Leong in an act of abuse.</p>
    <p>He in­sisted PM Lee did not suf­fer any dam­age to his rep­u­ta­tion, and de­served at most only de­risory dam­ages of $1 per per­son who saw the post.</p>
    <p>The two lawyers were mak­ing their clos­ing sub­mis­sions be­fore High Court judge Aedit Ab­dul­lah in the defama­tion suit against Mr Leong.</p>
    <p>On Nov 7, 2018, Mr Leong had shared an ar­ti­cle on Face­book ti­tled “Lee Hsien Loong be­comes 1MDB’s key in­ves­ti­ga­tion tar­get”, which said PM Lee was “cor­rupted” and had signed deals with his for­mer Malaysian coun­ter­part Na­jib Razak that were un­favourable to Malaysia “in ex­change for Sin­ga­pore banks’ as­sis­tance in money-laun­der­ing 1MDB’s bil­lions”.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, rep­re­sent­ing PM Lee, said it was hard to think of any other al­le­ga­tion more se­ri­ous than al­leg­ing that PM Lee was part of a global scam.</p>
    <p>He noted t hat blog­ger Roy Ngerng was or­dered to pay $150,000 to PM Lee over a blog post al­leg­ing mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund monies in 2015, adding that Mr Leong’s al­le­ga­tions were more se­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Lim Tean, rep­re­sent­ing Mr Leong, said PM Lee had not gone af­ter The Cov­er­age web­site, which was the source of the ar­ti­cle, and any­one else who had also shared it, adding that PM Lee had sued to si­lence Mr Leong ahead of the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He said that if PM Lee were to be awarded dam­ages, “a dol­lar is not out of the ques­tion”.</p>
    <p>Based on the tes­ti­mony of an ex­pert who es­ti­mated that at least 200 to 400 peo­ple would have seen the ar­ti­cle, it would mean $400 at most, the lawyer said.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Mr Singh said that Mr Lim’s num­bers re­flect Mr Leong’s “de­ter­mi­na­tion to hu­mil­i­ate (PM Lee) for do­ing no more than com­ing to court to ex­er­cise his le­gal rights and vin­di­cate his rep­u­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>He added that Mr Leong had also shown mal­ice by us­ing all av­enues to re­cast the is­sue as vic­tim­i­sa­tion, and us­ing the court as a plat­form to not just at­tack PM Lee, but also politi­cise the case by ac­cus­ing the Prime Min­is­ter of do­ing so in­stead.</p>
    <p>“When one not just turns the knife but uses it to ad­van­tage and, in that process, draws at­ten­tion to the li­bel and also at­tracts un­hap­pi­ness or ab­sence of sym­pa­thy for (PM Lee) who is merely ex­er­cis­ing his le­gal rights, that is rel­e­vant con­duct,” said Mr Singh adding that this was an ag­gra­vat­ing fac­tor.</p>
    <p>He said PM Lee had to sue to vin­di­cate him­self, and had taken the stand to be cross-ex­am­ined so that the court, an in­de­pen­dent, im­par­tial tri­bunal, can de­cide on the ve­rac­ity of the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>To this, Mr Lim said there was no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for th­ese claims, adding that they were “rou­tine” in PM Lee’s defama­tion suits.</p>
    <p>Among other ar­gu­ments, Mr Lim also said that cur­rent defama­tion laws are not tai­lored for the so­cial me­dia age, adding that Mr Leong’s ac­tions were merely akin to pass­ing to a friend a news­pa­per con­tain­ing a defam­a­tory ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing the ex­am­ple that 9,000 peo­ple had shared the ar­ti­cle, he said PM Lee could not pos­si­bly sue all 9,000 of them: “Very of­ten they come across some­thing in­ter­est­ing and they want to share it, are we to say then that each of them is po­ten­tially li­able to a defama­tion law­suit?”</p>
    <p>But Mr Singh said that with so­cial me­dia, it has be­come eas­ier for peo­ple to cause hurt and dam­age to others as defam­a­tory con­tent could be shared with­out much ef­fort, and thus greater cau­tion should be ex­er­cised.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, if any­thing, Your Hon­our, far from draw­ing bound­aries around the law as it ap­plies to so­cial me­dia and Face­book, in par­tic­u­lar, Your Hon­our’s judg­ment should re­mind peo­ple that they can­not hurt others just be­cause they are on so­cial me­dia and on Face­book, and that the laws ap­ply to them equally,” he added.</p>
