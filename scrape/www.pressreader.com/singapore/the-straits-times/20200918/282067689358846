    <p>What con­sti­tutes re­spon­si­ble jour­nal­ism when re­port­ing on al­le­ga­tions and how that would be prac­tised un­der Sin­ga­pore’s laws against fake news came un­der ex­am­i­na­tion yes­ter­day, as the apex court heard The On­line Cit­i­zen’s (TOC) ap­peal against a cor­rec­tion di­rec­tion it re­ceived.</p>
    <p>The so­cio-po­lit­i­cal site, which had re­ported on a Malaysian rights group’s claims of un­law­ful ex­e­cu­tion meth­ods by the Sin­ga­pore pris­ons, said it should be enough that it had asked the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) for a re­sponse and in­di­cated in the ar­ti­cle that the claims were al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>TOC, rep­re­sented by Mr Eu­gene Thu­raisingam, also ar­gued that it had not taken a po­si­tion on the al­le­ga­tions, and this was clear if the ar­ti­cle was read in full. Given this, TOC did not de­serve to be is­sued a cor­rec­tion or­der, the lawyer said.</p>
    <p>But the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers said a re­spon­si­ble news out­let would have made rea­son­able at­tempts to ver­ify in­for­ma­tion that could threaten pub­lic in­ter­est be­fore pub­lish­ing it.</p>
    <p>TOC sent an e-mail to MHA for ver­i­fi­ca­tion only mo­ments be­fore the ar­ti­cle was pub­lished, leav­ing scant time for the min­istry to re­spond, said Deputy Chief Coun­sel Hui Choon Kuen.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of how the Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act (Pofma) in­ter­acts with jour­nal­ism was can­vassed yes­ter­day when the five­judge apex court ques­tioned both sides on their ar­gu­ments.</p>
    <p>TOC was is­sued a cor­rec­tion di­rec­tion in Jan­uary over a story quot­ing Lawyers for Lib­erty that al­leged Sin­ga­pore’s prison of­fi­cers were in­structed to kick the heads of death-row pris­on­ers to snap their necks when the rope breaks dur­ing hang­ing, among other things.</p>
    <p>TOC then filed an ap­peal un­der Pofma to have the cor­rec­tion di­rec­tion set aside. This was dis­missed by High Court judge Belinda Ang.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Thu­raisingam said the Gov­ern­ment should is­sue a cor­rec­tion di­rec­tion only when a news out­let re­fuses to carry its re­sponse. He added that MHA had never replied to TOC’s query.</p>
    <p>Judge of Ap­peal Ju­dith Prakash noted that the na­ture of jour­nal­ism en­tails some pres­sure to pub­lish in a timely fash­ion. To this, Mr Hui said: “As a re­spon­si­ble jour­nal­ist, if you re­port on some­thing, and not just any­thing but some­thing that af­fects the pub­lic in­ter­est, you should make at­tempts to ver­ify.”</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon sug­gested this “im­poses quite a bur­den on re­spon­si­ble jour­nal­ism”.</p>
    <p>He posed a hy­po­thet­i­cal sce­nario of a news­pa­per re­ceiv­ing in­for­ma­tion from a whis­tle-blower which is a mat­ter of pub­lic in­ter­est, but can­not re­port on it un­til it is proven.</p>
    <p>“It wor­ries me that you’re say­ing Pofma al­lows the min­is­ter to come to a jour­nal­ist and say you can’t re­port that, or if you’re go­ing to re­port then you have to tell the world that you say it is un­true,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added this would mean there is a whole slew of things that the me­dia can­not bring to Sin­ga­pore­ans’ at­ten­tion un­til it is proven.</p>
    <p>Mr Hui, though, voiced con­cern over al­low­ing news out­lets to pub­lish any claim just by qual­i­fy­ing it as an al­le­ga­tion and in­di­cat­ing they had asked the Gov­ern­ment for com­ments. In the case of whis­tle-blow­ing, he said, there were other ways to raise the is­sue, and “mass com­mu­ni­cat­ing” it when it could af­fect Sin­ga­pore­ans is not the only way.</p>
    <p>To this, CJ Menon said: “I’m a tiny bit con­cerned, Mr Hui, that your sug­ges­tion is that Pofma was meant to pro­tect Sin­ga­pore­ans from them­selves, I don’t think that is cor­rect.”</p>
    <p>Judge of Ap­peal An­drew Phang said if a news out­let con­stantly harps on cer­tain themes and puts out ques­tion­able ar­ti­cles, it would lose cred­i­bil­ity. He added that if pat­terns are built up over time, that would also add to the con­text in which Pofma cases are con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal re­served judg­ment on the case.</p>
