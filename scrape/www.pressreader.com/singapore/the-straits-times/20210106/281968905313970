    <p>The fu­ture of Ant Group re­mains up in the air af­ter its dra­matic fall from grace.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors seem to have stopped short of dis­man­tling it, and the com­pany is con­sid­er­ing a tran­si­tion to a fi­nan­cial hold­ing com­pany, will­ing to be reg­u­lated like a bank. It’ll be tough.</p>
    <p>What could Ant ul­ti­mately look like?</p>
    <p>Bank-like com­pa­nies don’t com­mand tech-like val­u­a­tions. Un­less, of course, you’re in the boom­ing con­sumer fi­nance mar­ket in China, which is ex­pected to hit three tril­lion yuan (S$612 billion) in vol­umes over the next four years.</p>
    <p>That’s where credit de­mand is – and that’s where Ant’s reach is.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, state plan­ners are try­ing to gen­er­ate do­mes­tic de­mand and sup­ply, keep­ing with their so-called dual cir­cu­la­tion strat­egy.</p>
    <p>For that to work, credit will have to flow to house­holds ef­fec­tively. Beijing knows that too.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing dis­pos­able in­comes drove con­sump­tion growth for the bet­ter part of the last decade but have been slow­ing. That means the au­thor­i­ties need an­other way to keep China’s econ­omy hum­ming along.</p>
    <p>In 2019, con­sumer fi­nance cus­tomer num­bers swelled to al­most 130 mil­lion, up by more than half from the year be­fore. The state also knows that’s good for the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Data shows an in­creas­ing cor­re­la­tion be­tween the growth of con­sumer loans and re­tail sales in China. Ant could play an even larger role here than it is al­ready do­ing, with more skin in the game.</p>
    <p>Over the last year, the gov­ern­ment has en­cour­aged the growth of con­sumer fi­nance com­pa­nies and the ex­ist­ing units of banks that deal in the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>China’s Ping An In­sur­ance (Group), one of the largest in­sur­ance groups, re­ceived ap­proval for a new con­sumer fi­nance com­pany, as did China Con­struc­tion Bank, one of the largest lenders by as­sets.</p>
    <p>The bank­ing reg­u­la­tor also loos­ened re­stric­tions on these lenders and ex­panded fund­ing chan­nels by al­low­ing them to raise dif­fer­ent types of cap­i­tal, in­clud­ing Tier 2 cap­i­tal com­pli­ant bonds. Ant had hitched it­self to the trend.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust last year, it took a 50 per cent stake in a new con­sumer fi­nance com­pany set up with Nanyang Com­mer­cial Bank, bat­tery-maker Con­tem­po­rary Am­perex Tech­nol­ogy and others. The bank­ing reg­u­la­tor ap­proved it the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>To get back in the gov­ern­ment’s good graces, Ant could as­sure the au­thor­i­ties that it will help and not hin­der their agenda.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the com­pany’s Zhima Credit scor­ing sys­tem might di­lute wor­ries about banks tak­ing on risky loans and, in the larger scheme, dove­tail with the gov­ern­ment’s goal of pro­tect­ing house­hold wal­lets.</p>
    <p>Mor­ph­ing back into a much more clearly de­fined fi­nan­cial ser­vice player and away from the fuzzy fin­tech gi­ant oper­a­tions won’t be too tough for Ant. The hard part is cap­i­tal com­mit­ment.</p>
    <p>But as a con­sumer fi­nance com­pany, Ant could raise cap­i­tal via de­posits from its do­mes­tic share­hold­ers. It would also be al­lowed to bor­row from banks or is­sue fi­nan­cial bonds. Many of China’s li­censed con­sumer fi­nance com­pa­nies have com­mer­cial banks as back­ers.</p>
    <p>This isn’t likely to re­turn Ant to its su­per-uni­corn val­u­a­tions. How­ever, a stronger busi­ness model that is less re­liant on low ac­qui­si­tion costs and tack-on busi­nesses may ac­tu­ally sur­vive along­side Ant’s more es­tab­lished pay­ments busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Con­sider what’s hap­pened to Lend­ingClub, one of the largest fin­tech con­sumer lend­ing plat­forms in the United States. The com­pany started out as a mar­ket­place for bor­row­ers and lenders, hop­ing to up­end the bank­ing sys­tem. Six years on, it is buy­ing a bank. That pro­vides both cheaper fund­ing for Lend­ingClub and more clar­ity for reg­u­la­tors, who have ap­proved of the move. The stock has popped since then.</p>
    <p>From mar­ket forces in the US to reg­u­la­tors in China, there seems to be con­ver­gence on where large fin­tech play­ers should sit in fi­nan­cial sys­tems and the pur­pose they serve.</p>
