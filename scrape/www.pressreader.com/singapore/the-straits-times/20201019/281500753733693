    <p>Key meet­ings at the start of this week could de­ter­mine whether Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin re­mains in power, with his largest ally Umno set to de­cide on its threat to de­prive the Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter of his ra­zor-thin con­trol of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>To­day will see Umno, the Pre­mier’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia, and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) at­tempt to iron out dif­fer­ences us­ing their pro-Malay Mus­lim plat­form Muafakat Na­sional (MN).</p>
    <p>The once-dom­i­nant Umno, which has chafed at play­ing sec­ond fid­dle to Ber­satu, will also hold a supreme coun­cil meet­ing to­mor­row. But it is yet to be seen if the party’s top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body will need to rat­ify what­ever deal is struck at the MN showdown, which could in­clude a Cab­i­net reshuf­fle.</p>
    <p>With the cru­cial Bud­get 2021 to be tabled in Par­lia­ment in a fort­night, the nascent Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment is run­ning out of time to avoid col­lapse. This could re­sult in a pos­si­ble snap elec­tion in the midst of a resur­gent coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Umno’s po­lit­i­cal bureau, chaired by pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi, de­cided last Tues­day it would seek bet­ter terms to re­main in PN, a move that came just hours af­ter op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim claimed to have the back­ing of over 120 MPs fol­low­ing an au­di­ence with the King.</p>
    <p>Umno has 39 MPs, more than a third of the 113 in PN that gives the lat­ter a slim ma­jor­ity in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>But back­lash over a pos­si­ble al­liance with Datuk Seri An­war, chief of the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion, and es­pe­cially his largest ally Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), has given Zahid’s camp pause. The Chi­nese-dom­i­nated DAP is ac­cused by not just Umno, but other Malay Mus­lim par­ties in PN of un­der­min­ing the in­ter­ests of the Malay ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>PAS’ lead­er­ship was among the first to chide Umno for un­der­min­ing PN’s sta­bil­ity af­ter Zahid ad­mit­ted last month that there were “many MPs” in the party who sup­ported Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>PAS sec­re­tary-gen­eral Takiyud­din Has­san said: “If this sit­u­a­tion is true, it means Umno has not abided by the MN char­ter inked on Sept 14, 2019... with the ob­jec­tive to unite Mus­lims in the coun­try and de­feat PH.”</p>
    <p>Rul­ing coali­tion of­fi­cials have re­vealed to The Straits Times that Zahid, the for­mer deputy pre­mier, is de­mand­ing a Cab­i­net reshuf­fle that en­larges Umno’s role and for its min­is­ters to be se­lected based on “the party hi­er­ar­chy”. They add that Zahid is seek­ing to re­store his grip on the party, hav­ing seen his au­thor­ity un­der­mined by PM Muhyid­din since form­ing gov­ern­ment in March.</p>
    <p>The lion’s share of min­is­te­rial po­si­tions handed out to Umno in March went to Zahid’s ri­vals in the party and he was also em­bar­rassed when forced to cede the Sabah chief min­is­ter­ship to Ber­satu af­ter they won the Sept 26 vote in the east­ern­most state last month.</p>
    <p>“Party polls are due next year and there are sev­eral al­ready eye­ing Zahid’s pres­i­dency,” a source said.</p>
    <p>Zahid also has to wres­tle with a po­ten­tial in­ter­nal coup as Malaysia’s long­est-serv­ing law­maker Tengku Raza­leigh Hamzah is of­fer­ing him­self as an in­terim pre­mier un­til the next gen­eral elec­tion, due in 2023.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial sources told The Straits Times that Zahid met Umno supreme coun­cil mem­bers in­di­vid­u­ally last Thurs­day to ca­jole them to stick with him in­stead of Tengku Raza­leigh, the party’s ad­vi­sory coun­cil chief.</p>
    <p>Af­ter pur­ported let­ters to the palace sur­faced on Satur­day, in­di­cat­ing Zahid and for­mer pre­mier Na­jib Razak – his pre­de­ces­sor as Umno chief – were throw­ing sup­port be­hind Mr An­war, the party lead­er­ship has made stri­dent de­nials of any in­ten­tion to co­op­er­ate with their long­time neme­sis or DAP.</p>
    <p>This soft­en­ing stance came af­ter Zahid met PAS coun­ter­part Hadi Awang late on Fri­day. With an­other meet­ing that in­cludes Ber­satu chief Muhyid­din tak­ing place be­fore the of­fi­cial MN showdown, it ap­pears PAS could be a cru­cial peace­maker be­tween its two war­ring part­ners.</p>
    <p>Said a top Ber­satu of­fi­cial: “Umno is not con­cerned with clash­ing with Ber­satu but it saw the dam­age of go­ing up against PAS at the 2018 elec­tion. How­ever, PAS sees Ber­satu as a more amenable part­ner be­cause their stronghold­s don’t over­lap whereas Umno has tra­di­tion­ally laid claim to all states ex­cept for Sarawak.”</p>
