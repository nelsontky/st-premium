    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia’s top court yes­ter­day im­posed a sym­bolic fine of one ru­pee (two Sin­ga­pore cents) on a prom­i­nent lawyer found guilty of crim­i­nal con­tempt for posts on Twit­ter that were critical of se­nior judges, which he de­clined to apol­o­gise for.</p>
    <p>A three-mem­ber bench of the Supreme Court said that lawyer Prashant Bhushan must pay the fine by Sept 15, fail­ing which he could be im­pris­oned for three months and barred from prac­tice for three years.</p>
    <p>The case sparked a de­bate around free speech and the ju­di­ciary’s open­ness to crit­i­cism, with thou­sands of lawyers back­ing Mr Bhushan and ar­gu­ing that the court was be­ing too harsh.</p>
    <p>“Free­dom of ex­pres­sion is there, but rights of oth­ers should also be re­spected,” the court said while im­pos­ing the fine on Mr Bhushan.</p>
    <p>Mr Bhushan and his lawyers were not im­me­di­ately avail­able for com­ment.</p>
    <p>In June, Mr Bhushan posted a pho­to­graph that he said showed Chief Jus­tice S. A. Bobde astride a Har­ley-David­son mo­tor­cy­cle, say­ing he was rid­ing a five-mil­lion ru­pee bike with­out a mask or a hel­met while cit­i­zens were be­ing de­nied jus­tice as the court was in lock­down.</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Bobde has not com­mented pub­licly on the pho­to­graph.</p>
    <p>In an­other post on Twit­ter the same month, Mr Bhushan said that when his­to­ri­ans looked at how democ­racy had been de­stroyed in In­dia in the past six years, they would note the role of the Supreme Court and the past four top jus­tices.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter blocked both of the posts.</p>
    <p>In a 108-page or­der hold­ing him guilty of crim­i­nal con­tempt ear­lier last month, the court had said the first post was “patently false”.</p>
    <p>The same or­der said the sec­ond post had the “ef­fect of desta­bil­is­ing the very foun­da­tion of this im­por­tant pil­lar of the In­dian democ­racy”, re­fer­ring to the ju­di­ciary.</p>
    <p>The court then asked Mr Bhushan, who has cham­pi­oned pub­lic in­ter­est lit­i­ga­tion, to is­sue an “un­con­di­tional apol­ogy”, which he de­clined to do, lead­ing to the sen­tence yes­ter­day.</p>
