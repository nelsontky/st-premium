    <p>One ben­e­fit of work­ing from home for data sci­en­tist Malavika Menon, 26, is get­ting to spend more time with her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Ms Menon, who works at Go­jek, now bonds with them by pot­ter­ing around the kitchen, watch­ing Net­flix and help­ing out with house­hold chores. “I miss the time when we were all at home,” she said of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod be­tween April and June when most of Sin­ga­pore worked from home.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, Ms Menon, who builds rec­om­men­da­tion mod­els and en­gines for Go­jek’s GoFood prod­ucts in In­done­sia, Thai­land and Viet­nam, trav­elled ev­ery five or six weeks to neigh­bour­ing coun­tries for re­search. Each trip would last about a week.</p>
    <p>Now, she rel­ishes her time at home, whip­ping up treats such as plum jam and Nepalese dumplings in the kitchen.</p>
    <p>“We used to go out to eat of­ten, es</p>
    <p>pe­cially on week­ends,” she said, but fam­ily meals at home let her bond with her par­ents and her 24-yearold sis­ter.</p>
    <p>Spend­ing more time with fam­ily, col­leagues and friends is also one of the ben­e­fits of work­ing from home for Ms An­gel Ng, 27, sales team leader at crowd-in­vest­ing firm Fund­ing So­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>She makes daily calls out­side of work to her col­leagues and friends to find out how they are spend­ing their time, such as what they have cooked for the day, she said.</p>
    <p>The calls are also a way for them to keep one another’s spir­its up amid the pan­demic, she said.</p>
    <p>To help staff get a bet­ter work-life bal­ance, Ms Ng’s com­pany pro­vides a bud­get for teams to meet for lunch, with a cap of five peo­ple, to help those who may feel iso­lated work­ing from home.</p>
