    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s govern­ment said yes­ter­day that 12 prodemoc­racy can­di­dates had been dis­qual­i­fied from run­ning for elec­tion to the leg­is­la­ture, cit­ing op­po­si­tion to a new na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed by Bei­jing, but de­nied in­fring­ing civil rights.</p>
    <p>Dis­qual­i­fied can­di­dates in­cluded pro-democ­racy ac­tivist Joshua Wong, some mem­bers of the Civic Party, a moder­ate, old-guard op­po­si­tion group, and oth­ers who won an un­of­fi­cial “pri­mary” vote by the op­po­si­tion camp this month.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment said there could be more dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The move came less than 24 hours after four peo­ple were ar­rested for sus­pected of­fences un­der the se­cu­rity law. The back-to-back ac­tions were seen as a sweep­ing ges­ture show­ing how much the na­tional se­cu­rity law en­acted last month had strength­ened Bei­jing’s hand.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics said the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion sought to curb the as­cen­dancy of a young, more de­fi­ant gen­er­a­tion of pro-democ­racy ac­tivists after an over­whelm­ing win in last year’s lower-level dis­trict coun­cil elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, #Bei­jing shows a to­tal dis­re­gard for the will of the #Hongkonger­s, tram­ples upon the city’s last pil­lar of van­ish­ing au­ton­omy and at­tempts to keep #HK’s leg­is­la­ture un­der its firm grip,” Mr Wong tweeted.</p>
    <p>Chances for a his­toric ma­jor­ity in the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil, or miniPar­lia­ment, for the op­po­si­tion camp will take a fur­ther blow if the govern­ment de­cides to post­pone the Sept 6 vote, as ex­pected, amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has dis­qual­i­fied can­di­dates be­fore, but not on this scale.</p>
    <p>The dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of Civic Party can­di­dates sig­nals that Bei­jing is be­com­ing less tol­er­ant of even moder­ate democrats, who have for decades been a vo­cal op­po­si­tion in the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment is con­struct­ing a CCP (Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party) as­sem­bly in Legco to elim­i­nate most of the op­po­si­tion voices. Out­ra­geous,” tweeted Mr Nathan Law, a pro-democ­racy ac­tivist and for­mer law­maker who was kicked out of the leg­is­la­ture. He fled Hong Kong for Bri­tain ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The Civic Party said its ex­is­tence is not con­fined to the leg­is­la­ture, of­ten re­ferred to as the Legco, and it will con­tinue to work for its val­ues.</p>
    <p>“When the regime wishes to en­slave us, the best thing to do is to stand firm and tell the regime we would not change,” said party mem­ber Kwok Ka-ki, who was among those dis­qual­i­fied.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong govern­ment said ad­vo­cat­ing self-de­ter­mi­na­tion, so­lic­it­ing in­ter­ven­tion by for­eign gov­ern­ments, or “ex­press­ing an ob­jec­tion in prin­ci­ple” to the en­act­ment of the new se­cu­rity law was be­hav­iour that “could not gen­uinely” up­hold the city’s mini-Con­sti­tu­tion, the Ba­sic Law.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates are re­quired by law to pledge al­le­giance to Hong Kong and the Ba­sic Law.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment said there was “no ques­tion of any po­lit­i­cal cen­sor­ship, re­stric­tion of the free­dom of speech or de­pri­va­tion of the right to stand for elec­tions as al­leged by some mem­bers of the com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s top rep­re­sen­ta­tive of­fice in the city, the Hong Kong Li­ai­son Of­fice, said it sup­ported the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tions as the can­di­dates aimed to “paral­yse the govern­ment” and “sub­vert state power”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing in­tro­duced the se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion to pun­ish what it broadly de­fines as se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces in the for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics of the law say it erodes ba­sic rights and free­doms, while sup­port­ers say it will bring sta­bil­ity after a year of of­ten-vi­o­lent anti-govern­ment and anti-China un­rest.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing says it was vi­tal to plug na­tional se­cu­rity loop­holes left open by Hong Kong’s in­abil­ity to pass such leg­is­la­tion on its own, as re­quired by the Ba­sic Law.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s last Bri­tish gov­er­nor Chris Pat­ten called the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tions an “out­ra­geous po­lit­i­cal purge”.</p>
    <p>Late on Wednes­day night, Hong Kong po­lice said they ar­rested four peo­ple aged 16 to 21 for sus­pected of­fences un­der the new se­cu­rity law, the first such de­ten­tions out­side of street protests.</p>
    <p>The three men and a wo­man, all stu­dents, were sus­pected of be­ing in­volved in an on­line group that pledged to use ev­ery means to fight for an in­de­pen­dent Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent Lo­cal­ism, a group that used to ad­vo­cate in­de­pen­dence, said its for­mer leader Tony Chung, 19, was among those ar­rested. Two other for­mer mem­bers were iden­ti­fied by lo­cal politi­cians and me­dia.</p>
