    <p>“Two years be­fore leav­ing home, my fa­ther said to my mother that I was very ugly.”</p>
    <p>So be­gins the stun­ner of a para­graph that opens Ital­ian au­thor Elena Fer­rante’s first novel in five years, The Ly­ing Life Of Adults.</p>
    <p>Th­ese words may seem to fix the fate of Gio­vanna, who is 12 when she hears them ut­tered. Re­ally, they un­moor her.</p>
    <p>“But I slipped away,” she says, “and am still slip­ping away, within th­ese lines that are in­tended to give me a story... no­body, not even the one who at this mo­ment is writ­ing, knows if it con­tains the right thread for a story or is merely a snarled con­fu­sion of suf­fer­ing, with­out re­demp­tion.”</p>
    <p>Few au­thors are as elu­sive yet un­flinch­ingly, un­err­ingly evoca­tive as Fer­rante, the pseudony­mous au­thor of the Neapoli­tan Nov­els (2012 to 2015), which took the world by storm with their de­pic­tion of a com­plex fe­male friend­ship.</p>
    <p>In The Ly­ing Life Of Adults, she re­turns once more to the grit of Naples, and to the snarls and splin­ters of fe­male ado­les­cence.</p>
    <p>What Gio­vanna’s fa­ther ac­tu­ally says is that she is be­gin­ning to re­sem­ble her aunt Vit­to­ria, a woman in whom “ug­li­ness and spite were com­bined to per­fec­tion” and who has al­legedly poi­soned the rest of his fam­ily against him.</p>
    <p>In Gio­vanna’s im­pres­sion­able teenage mind, her fa­ther’s words fix them­selves as prophecy: She is des­tined to be­come what he de­spises.</p>
    <p>But now she is ob­sessed with find­ing out more about this un­wanted fu­ture, so she seeks out Vit­to­ria. From this point, the foun­da­tions of her com­fort­able fam­ily unit be­gin to crum­ble as lie af­ter lie is ex­posed.</p>
    <p>Gio­vanna – smart, sen­si­tive and self-ab­sorbed – is be­set both by rag­ing in­se­cu­rity and a melo­dra­matic teenage con­vic­tion that the world re­volves around her prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing spilled a se­cret, she prays to God to put things back in or­der, “be­cause if he didn’t, ev­ery­thing would col­lapse. San Gi­a­como dei Capri would tum­ble onto the Vomero and the Vomero onto the en­tire city, and the en­tire city would drown in the sea”.</p>
    <p>Fer­rante il­lus­trates the class di­vide through Gio­vanna’s travers­ing of Naples. To see Vit­to­ria, she must lit­er­ally de­scend from her mid­dle-class home in the high­est part of the city to the bleak depths of the In­dus­trial Zone, where the peo­ple speak the Neapoli­tan di­alect her fa­ther has banned in their house.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther es­caped the neigh­bour­hood through his in­tel­lect, but Vit­to­ria re­mains en­trenched in it. Coarse, mag­netic and tem­pes­tu­ous, she works as a cleaner to sup­port the three chil­dren of the woman whose hus­band she stole. To Gio­vanna, she pos­sesses a “beauty so un­bear­able that to con­sider her ugly be­came a ne­ces­sity”.</p>
    <p>Sex, the driv­ing force that un­der­pins most of the char­ac­ters’ ac­tions, is de­sir­able in the ab­stract and dis­com­fit­ing in its phys­i­cal­ity. Hav­ing cho­sen to rebel by lean­ing into the ug­li­ness her fa­ther pre­dicted for her, Gio­vanna chases mean­ing in man af­ter man – though sex, when she ex­pe­ri­ences it, proves ap­pallingly ba­nal.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing dis­cov­ered that adult­hood is fun­da­men­tally adul­ter­ous, she learns to weave lies of her own. How much of a woman is the story she tells oth­ers of her­self?</p>
    <p>This is an es­pe­cially weighted ques­tion from Fer­rante, who has in­sis­tently aligned her anonymity with her au­thor­ship de­spite at­tempts to ex­pose her iden­tity.</p>
    <p>As Gio­vanna warned at the be­gin­ning, this is not a story of re­demp­tion or any­thing like clo­sure. It is, how­ever, one of a young woman start­ing to make mean­ing of her­self.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read:</p>
    <p>The Neapoli­tan Nov­els by the same au­thor and trans­la­tor, be­gin­ning with My Bril­liant Friend (Europa Edi­tions, 2012, $19.26, avail­able at bit.ly/ Gir­lHalfFT_EM), a com­ing-of-age story about the friend­ship be­tween Elena and Lila, who grow up in a poor, vi­o­lent neigh­bour­hood in 1950s Naples. Their paths di­verge when Elena’s par­ents al­low her to con­tinue school­ing but Lila’s do not.</p>
