    <p>I have a fond­ness for Ein­stein. More and more as I grow older, or I should say old, Al­bert Ein­stein is my poster boy.</p>
    <p>We rarely see a pho­to­graph of a young Ein­stein, when he was se­cretly grap­pling in the Swiss Patents Of­fice with the out­ra­geous idea of rel­a­tiv­ity. We mostly see pic­tures of an old Ein­stein, with his mop of white curly hair. There is a rea­son for this. In the col­lec­tive mind of the world, Ein­stein is a kind of mod­ern-day Lao Tzu, known be­yond his ge­nius for his wis­dom and his quotes.</p>
    <p>“I have reached an age when, if some­one tells me to wear socks, I don’t have to,” he re­marked, de­scrib­ing the pos­i­tiv­ity of old age with more aplomb than prob­a­bly any­one in his­tory.</p>
    <p>Over these months of Covid-19, the el­derly have been high­lighted for their vul­ner­a­bil­ity be­fore the virus, in many in­stances touch­ingly pro­tected, but also hor­rif­i­cally dis­missed. In­stances are be­ing re­vealed around the world of the aged be­ing pushed to the mar­gins.</p>
    <p>Sud­denly, whether we are ready for it or not, those of us who can no longer dance all night are ap­pre­hen­sively won­der­ing where el­derly ends and aged be­gins. Reach­ing this place is a shock. Only yes­ter­day we were set­ting out to row down the river and, to­day, the ocean is vis­i­ble ahead and we won­der how we got here.</p>
    <p>The strangest thing about this jour­ney is that you still feel You, change­less and age­less in your essence. The same You who proudly dressed your­self for the first time without help, who cried out­side the school gates when a par­ent was late to ar­rive, now awaits a great grand­child. Yet, name­less, form­less, eter­nal, it is that same time­less You that silently wit­nesses each new event on the jour­ney.</p>
    <p>On an­other level, we know we are al­ways chang­ing, both phys­i­cally and men­tally, just as the scenery along the life we travel is al­ways chang­ing. The cells of our body are con­stantly re­placed; ev­ery seven years we reg­u­larly cre­ate a new body and never no­tice, ex­cept when ill­ness in­vades or wrin­kles form.</p>
    <p>We ig­nore the vast and com­plex cos­mos within us that stead­fastly goes about the busi­ness of keep­ing us alive, un­aware that our in­ner body has a con­scious­ness all its own. This in­tel­li­gence func­tions in­de­pen­dently, without our per­mis­sion, mak­ing au­ton­o­mous de­ci­sions. Yet, we live as if we con­trol all things and will al­ways be around.</p>
    <p>In this part of the world, age is tra­di­tion­ally revered. Shou Xing, god of longevity, his fore­head stretched to ac­com­mo­date the im­mense wis­dom of his many years, is es­teemed among Chi­nese gods. Yet, even Shou Xing faces de­mo­tion in our mod­ern times be­fore the growing tide of ageism. Al­though the aged have al­ways known when they are old in com­par­i­son to the young, the phe­nom­e­non of ageism as a form of dis­crim­i­na­tion seems es­pe­cially char­ac­ter­is­tic to our epoch.</p>
    <p>That dark uni­verse of the col­lec­tive mind, the In­ter­net, with its re­lent­less tide of ad­ver­tis­ing, TikTok, Twit­ter et al, ag­gres­sively mar­kets youth. There is noth­ing wrong with youth. The young make the world go round, do­ing all the things the aged once did, and more.</p>
    <p>Yet, it needs to be firmly pointed out that, apart from arthri­tis and creak­ing joints and what­ever more we suf­fer, the aged have ex­clu­sive pro­pri­etor­ship of the world’s most prized pos­ses­sion. Wis­dom is the great gift age be­stows upon us. Wis­dom, the residue of life’s hard bat­tles and pains, can­not be ac­quired through any process but age­ing. It is a gift worth wait­ing for.</p>
    <p>In many ways, there has never been a bet­ter time to be old.</p>
    <p>Mod­ern medicine must take a bow for its abil­ity to tem­per in­fir­mity. Yet, as much as this, it is the sheer vi­tal­ity of our age with its search for new hori­zons and the shat­ter­ing of bound­aries, that has re­vi­talised the con­cept of age­ing. Whether land­ing on Mars or the Mar­i­ana Trench, the strange meet­ing of sci­ence and spir­i­tu­al­ity through quan­tum physics, or the re­defin­ing of gen­der and LGBT (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der) rights, every­thing once thought im­mov­able has sud­denly be­come fluid.</p>
    <p>So it is that we now say with ease, 80 is the new 60, or 70 is the new 50, or, you are as old as you feel. So it is that there are now more cen­tu­ri­ons in the world than has ever been recorded. Ja­pan used to give a sil­ver sake cup to any­one pass­ing 100 years. The govern­ment has been forced to aban­don this prac­tice, be­cause the num­ber of peo­ple now reach­ing that land­mark makes it too costly a nicety.</p>
    <p>Reach­ing a great age does not nec­es­sar­ily mean a re­treat into pas­siv­ity. The world is full of in­cred­i­ble peo­ple. Jeanne Cal­ment, sup­pos­edly the old­est per­son who ever lived, died at the age of 122 years. She was men­tally sharp to the end of her life, and cog­ni­tive tests when she was 118 found her mem­ory and lan­guage com­pa­ra­ble to that of an 80 year old. Pi­casso in his 90s was still pro­duc­ing master­pieces, as was Matisse, as were artists Stravin­sky, Doris Less­ing and Pablo Casals and so many more. There are no rules to age­ing, only ex­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>Iden­tity is also a fluid en­tity and the el­derly should not be cat­e­gorised as hav­ing uni­form char­ac­ter­is­tics. I know a 96-year-old who be­gan to paint at 94, climbed six flights of stairs to her art class each week, and had a re­cent ex­hi­bi­tion. Bri­tish sci­en­tist James Love­lock, 101, creator of the evo­lu­tion­ary Gaia The­ory, says he has never felt bet­ter than he does now. Nat­u­ral his­to­rian David At­ten­bor­ough will echo that. At this time, dur­ing Covid-19, France’s old­est doc­tor, 98-year-old</p>
    <p>Chris­tian Chenay, is still vis­it­ing a nearby re­tire­ment home to pro­vide med­i­cal sup­port for the in­hab­i­tants. Feisty 113-year-old Maria Branyas, Spain’s old­est Covid-19 sur­vivor, is call­ing for noth­ing less than a new world or­der in at­ti­tudes to the aged. In her re­cent Twit­ter de­but, she says, “I am old, very old, but not an id­iot. I do not look back. I only look for­ward.”</p>
    <p>It is sim­plis­tic to think all el­derly lives have a sil­ver lin­ing. The high in­ci­dence of de­men­tia and geri­atric dis­ease is well-known. We can never know what to­mor­row brings, yet, if the genes hold out, and grace is with us, why not ex­pect to fol­low Cal­ment, Pi­casso, Love­lock and so many more?</p>
    <p>Nowa­days, when a bright young thing asks how old I am, I re­ply I am be­tween 50 and death, and let them make of that what they will.</p>
