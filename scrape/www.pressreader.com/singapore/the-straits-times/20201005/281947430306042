    <p>Will Amer­ica be able to hold an even half­way nor­mal elec­tion next month, or have a nor­mal demo­cratic tran­si­tion in Jan­uary?</p>
    <p>It was ques­tion­able even be­fore the shock rev­e­la­tion last week about United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Covid-19 in­fec­tion, and the rea­son for it is that the Nov 3 elec­tion’s le­git­i­macy and in­tegrity were be­clouded by an un­prece­dented com­bi­na­tion of three dis­rup­tive in­flu­ences: for­eign in­ter­fer­ence; the novel lo­gis­ti­cal dis­tor­tions of Covid-19; and an in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent who, un­like any of his pre­de­ces­sors, vowed not to recog­nise the le­git­i­macy of any re­sult that counted him the loser.</p>
    <p>The news last Thurs­day that the Pres­i­dent is sick with Covid-19 adds new un­cer­tain­ties and com­plex­i­ties to an al­ready con­vo­luted sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ques­tion­ing of the le­git­i­macy of the elec­tion out­come is no sur­prise. He made sim­i­lar state­ments in 2016, and even tagged an elec­tion he won rigged be­cause he did not carry the pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>On Sept 24, he re­turned to his 2016 vow, sig­nalling he would not re­lin­quish power or ever con­cede the elec­tion to the Democrats; and he added two com­ments that, seen to­gether, re­vealed what was re­ally go­ing on in his head and the heads of his base of sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>First, Mr Trump said the elec­tion might be de­cided in the Supreme Court, as was the 2000 elec­tion for the first and only time in US his­tory. His rea­son: mas­sive fraud, “a Demo­cratic scam” with mail-in bal­lots, a claim for which no ev­i­dence what­so­ever ex­ists – and which the state and ap­pel­late courts re­port­edly view with great scep­ti­cism. The claim was clearly meant as a stalk­ing horse, a marker, for a tac­tic-in-wait­ing.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, he told his fol­low­ers that if he lost, it would mean the end of “our great Repub­li­can Party”.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can “brain trust” be­lieved even be­fore the first de­bate last Tues­day that Mr Trump would likely lose the elec­tion. Af­ter it, their pes­simism deep­ened, notwith­stand­ing ques­tions about the polls’ re­li­a­bil­ity. Repub­li­can lead­ers and pro­fes­sion­als be­lieved the bad news be­cause they are deeply bi­ased by the spec­tre of de­mo­graphic shift.</p>
    <p>REPUB­LI­CAN FEARS</p>
    <p>For years now the right has per­suaded it­self, de­spite its man­gling the ev­i­dence – not all “His­pan­ics” are non-white but all are reck­oned as such, for ex­am­ple – that “white peo­ple” will soon be over­whelmed by an elec­torate com­posed of a “ma­jor­ity of mi­nori­ties”.</p>
    <p>Ob­sessed by a ric­o­cheted form of white iden­tity pol­i­tics, which is partly about race but also partly about cul­tural in­se­cu­ri­ties and class cleav­ages, they be­lieved they could not win a fair elec­tion next month. That ac­counts for the ramp­ing up of sev­eral voter sup­pres­sion tech­niques prac­tised in many lo­cales for years in an ef­fort to make the elec­tion not fair.</p>
    <p>But since even that might not suf­fice, the Repub­li­cans have been ready­ing a sce­nario to force the elec­tion re­sult into the Supreme Court, where, af­ter a speedy re­place­ment of the late Ruth Bader Gins­burg with a youngish, fe­male con­ser­va­tive Justice, they will hold a 6-3 ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>That sce­nario has many as­pects, all laid out by Mr Bar­ton Gell­man in a re­cent At­lantic es­say, but it de­pends es­pe­cially on lever­ag­ing the time lag be­tween count­ing votes cast at bal­lot­ing sta­tions and count­ing mail-in votes. The sce­nario has been that Mr Trump may lead in some key swing states right af­ter the polls close, so the strat­a­gem had him declar­ing quick vic­tory be­fore the char­ac­ter­is­tic “blue shift” of votes for the Demo­cratic ticket takes hold.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­cans planned to claim these pro-(Joe) Bi­den mail-in bal­lots were fraud­u­lent or tainted, and in most states with Repub­li­can gov­er­nors ev­i­dence would not have been re­quired to get the count sus­pended for the du­ra­tion of a le­gal hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Such le­gal shenani­gans, most ex­pected, would likely be ac­com­pa­nied by mas­sive street protests and no small dol­lop of pres­suris­ing po­lit­i­cal vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Now the Repub­li­can brain trust must make a new set of as­sump­tions – that Mr Trump will be in­ca­pac­i­tated by the Covid-19 virus or even die, which would mean putting up Mr Mike Pence, the No. 2 on the ticket, as their pres­i­den­tial can­di­date.</p>
    <p>While they can­not say so in pub­lic, that is good news for them. Mr Trump’s racism grew too overt be­fore too large an au­di­ence: Mr Pence will have most of a month to change the op­tic. Vot­ers drawn to Mr Trump’s ethno-na­tion­al­ist mes­sag­ing will still go Repub­li­can, but Mr Pence, a far less con­tro­ver­sial fig­ure, can re­claim some of the dis­af­fected cen­tre. That said, the “mail-in fraud Supreme Court” sce­nario will re­main in readi­ness.</p>
    <p>‘WHITE’ TRUMPS DEMOC­RACY</p>
    <p>Let’s be clear what this means. It means the Repub­li­can Party has reached a cru­cial moment in what has been a con­sis­tent if sub­tle cam­paign over the past four years to sub­sti­tute a form of “dirty white” ethno-na­tion­al­ism for the lib­eral, En­light­en­ment-defined civic na­tion­al­ism that has al­ways con­sti­tuted the main­stream of Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal prin­ci­ples.</p>
    <p>When Pres­i­dent Trump re­ferred in the sum­mer of 2017 to “some fine peo­ple” ral­ly­ing un­der a Nazi flag in Char­lottesvill­e, Vir­ginia, that na­tion­al­ism bait-and-switch is ex­actly what he was sell­ing. What has been a mar­ginal dis­cor­dant des­cant in US his­tory now threat­ens to carry the main, Wag­ne­r­ian melody of the Amer­i­can fu­ture.</p>
    <p>It means, to put it bluntly, that when faced with a choice be­tween per­pet­u­at­ing a “white” na­tion, what­ever ex­actly that means, and per­pet­u­at­ing democ­racy, this Repub­li­can Party will choose the for­mer. That is why Mr Trump equated hav­ing to re­lin­quish power with the demise of the party, for the na­tion’s de­mog­ra­phy hav­ing “tipped”, he be­lieves that Repub­li­cans will never again win the White House.</p>
    <p>Given that imag­ined ex­is­ten­tial view, Repub­li­cans be­lieve they can­not af­ford to play fair, so one side will play by the rules and the other – demon­stra­bly trans­ac­tion­al­ist in its now stan­dard modus operandi – will not.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­cans are will­ing to in­stru­men­talise even the rule of law it­self for anti-con­sti­tu­tional pur­poses. Re­mem­ber the Se­nate’s sham im­peach­ment trial from this past au­tumn? Same thing, same rea­son. That, pre­cisely, is what Mr Trump’s com­ments on Sept 24 and his de­bate per­for­mance made clearer than ever hereto­fore. His ill­ness changes noth­ing es­sen­tial in this re­gard.</p>
    <p>DEMOC­RACY ? LIB­ER­AL­ISM</p>
    <p>What does this omi­nous de­vel­op­ment in a ma­jor Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal party mean in a deeper sense? The an­swer lies in a crit­i­cal dis­tinc­tion: Democ­racy and lib­er­al­ism are not the same. They have dif­fer­ent his­to­ries and on­tolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Democ­racy is just a way to elect lead­ers in a frame­work of pop­u­lar sovereignt­y. Democ­racy is twinned with lib­er­al­ism in the Amer­i­can mind be­cause of his­tor­i­cal co­in­ci­dence. But there can be fairly elected Par­lia­ments sub­sumed within au­to­cratic poli­ties (think Bis­marck-era Ger­many) and there are true elec­toral democ­ra­cies to­day that are ex­plic­itly il­lib­eral (note Mr Vik­tor Or­ban’s Hun­gary).</p>
    <p>Lib­er­al­ism is a set of philo­soph­i­cally kin­dred at­ti­tudes, a so­cial tem­per­a­ment to­wards pub­lic life, that emerged from an­tique an­tecedents in Jerusalem, Athens and Rome into its mod­ern form in the 17th and 18th cen­turies via an in­ter­min­gling of the West’s sci­en­tific rev­o­lu­tion and the main pro-mod­ern (Epis­co­palian, not Calvin­ist) shard of the Protes­tant Ref­or­ma­tion. (It is wrong and mis­lead­ing to re­duce lib­er­al­ism or “neo-lib­er­al­ism” to a sin­gle flat eco­nomic di­men­sion, and wrong to con­fuse it with a la­bel for pro-statist me­lior­ism as the term has come to be used in Amer­ica.)</p>
    <p>Five key hall­marks of lib­er­al­ism are: sec­u­lar­ism, not only in pol­i­tics but also in re­la­tion to the arts; the en­throne­ment of in­di­vid­ual lib­erty over both com­mu­nal au­thor­ity and group affin­ity as the moral met­ric of po­lit­i­cal agency; the con­cept of a loyal op­po­si­tion that af­firms the value of doubt, hu­mil­ity, dis­sent, and open and free de­bate; pro­tec­tion of mi­nor­ity civil rights from the tyranny of the ma­jor­ity; and the sovereignt­y of law over per­sons within a con­sti­tu­tional frame­work.</p>
    <p>For most of the past four years, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s main threat to Amer­i­can norms has been aimed at lib­er­al­ism. The wax­ing left in US pol­i­tics, it must be noted, has also be­come in­creas­ingly il­lib­eral and de facto anti-En­light­en­ment, which has only goaded the right’s para­noia. Be­tween racialised cyn­ics on the right and Utopian-minded saints on the left, the En­light­en­ment-based Amer­i­can cen­tre has be­come be­sieged.</p>
    <p>What, then, is the prac­ti­cal con­nec­tion be­tween democ­racy and lib­er­al­ism to­day? Democ­racy is best thought of as a shield, an in­sur­ance pol­icy of sorts, to pro­tect lib­eral val­ues from a would-be dem­a­gogue, char­la­tan or po­lit­i­cal shaman – in other words, a man like Mr Trump. That’s why democ­racy has now come un­der Repub­li­can at­tack, the bet­ter to un­der­mine the lib­er­al­ism that in their view en­ables the shift in po­lit­i­cal de­mog­ra­phy they op­pose.</p>
    <p>But democ­racy works as a shield only if the at­ti­tudes of the peo­ple them­selves align with ba­sic lib­eral prin­ci­ples which, long story short, them­selves com­pose an in­ner shield to pro­tect the au­ton­omy of pri­vate in­di­vid­ual and fam­ily life.</p>
    <p>When for rea­sons of af­flu­ence-en­abled deca­dence, elite ab­di­ca­tion of myth main­te­nance and civic re­spon­si­bil­ity, and a tech­nol­ogy-pro­pelled de­cline in deep lit­er­acy with a con­comi­tant rise in mag­i­cal think­ing and con­spir­acy-mon­ger­ing, enough peo­ple stop un­der­stand­ing or car­ing about lib­eral prin­ci­ples, then demo­cratic forms are hap­less pro­tec­tors of what used to in­fuse the hearts and minds of a free and en­light­ened peo­ple.</p>
    <p>We have been warned. Judge Learned Hand said on May 21, 1944: “Lib­erty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no Con­sti­tu­tion, no law, no court can save it; no Con­sti­tu­tion, no law, no court can even do much to help it.”</p>
    <p>Has it re­ally come to that, or will the lib­eral demo­cratic pulse of the Amer­i­can body politic rise to the oc­ca­sion? News of the Pres­i­dent’s ill­ness changes the lyrics to the present drama but not the tune.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING INTO A MIR­ROR</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans can shud­der at the fright­en­ing cir­cum­stances in which they find them­selves, and they can mete out blame: It’s Mr Trump and the Repub­li­cans; it’s the ir­re­spon­si­ble, po­lit­i­cally cor­rect left; it’s the Rus­sians; it’s the soul­less, big-tech jug­ger­nauts who cal­lously shove the dig­i­tal dilemma up our nos­trils as they dance all the way to the bank.</p>
    <p>Fright­ened Amer­i­cans can point all the fin­gers they want, but if they dare to be hon­est, they’ll point while look­ing into a mir­ror.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, demo­cratic elec­torates get the gov­ern­ments they de­serve. So then con­sider as Nov 3 ap­proaches a prophetic re­mark, from a cen­tury ago, ut­tered by the iras­ci­ble jour­nal­ist and so­cial critic H. L. Mencken: “As democ­racy is per­fected, the of­fice of the pres­i­dent rep­re­sents, more and more closely, the in­ner soul of the peo­ple. On some great and glo­ri­ous day, the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s de­sire at last, and the White House will be oc­cu­pied by a down­right fool and com­plete nar­cis­sis­tic mo­ron.”</p>
    <p>OK, been there, did that. Has the na­tion learnt its les­son and will it now move on to a bet­ter place? We’re bound soon to find out.</p>
