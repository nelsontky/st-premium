    <p>Chengzhu Man­darin Kin­der­garten of­fers a four-hour pro­gramme five days a week for chil­dren from Nurs­ery 1 to Kin­der­garten 2.</p>
    <p>The 6,900 sq ft cen­tre in Rochester Mall is part of the Ju­lia Gabriel Ed­u­ca­tion group, which has more than 20 years’ ex­pe­ri­ence in run­ning Man­darin pro­grammes. Its fees range from $3,600 for nurs­ery lev­els to $4,200 for kin­der­garten lev­els for a term of about 10 weeks, in­clud­ing GST.</p>
    <p>The kin­der­garten, which opened in 2016 and had about 80 chil­dren en­rolled this year, is known for its Man­darin im­mer­sion ap­proach that uses speech, drama, mu­sic, move­ment and cul­tural arts. The cen­tre has a ca­pac­ity of around 100 stu­dents.</p>
    <p>From K1, chil­dren also have ex­po­sure to an hour of English a day to pre­pare them for the tran­si­tion to pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre has a small teacher-to-child ra­tio, al­low­ing teach­ers to know the chil­dren and their fam­i­lies well. N1 and N2 lev­els have two teach­ers to 12 chil­dren, while K1 and K2 lev­els have two teach­ers to 14 pupils.</p>
    <p>WHAT THE PRE-SCHOOL OF­FERS</p>
    <p>Ms Huang Ying, head of Chengzhu Man­darin Cen­tre, says its cur­ricu­lum cov­ers all sub­ject ar­eas and is de­signed by early child­hood and Chi­nese-lan­guage spe­cial­ists from Sin­ga­pore and China.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers have early child­hood teach­ing qual­i­fi­ca­tions and are na­tive Man­darin speak­ers from China, Tai­wan and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude sto­ry­telling, role-play­ing, art and craft, speak­ing and lis­ten­ing and read­ing and writ­ing. These are de­signed to sup­port chil­dren’s cog­ni­tive de­vel­op­ment and boost con­fi­dence, self-aware­ness, Man­darin com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills and in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Ms Huang says a pri­or­ity is bal­anc­ing high aca­demic stan­dards and meet­ing the emo­tional and so­cial needs of ev­ery child. “Push­ing chil­dren aca­dem­i­cally with­out pay­ing at­ten­tion to their creative, emo­tional and so­cial needs does not make for happy, well­rounded learn­ers,” she adds.</p>
    <p>The kin­der­garten also has math­e­mat­ics and phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren ex­plore five ar­eas in maths: num­bers and op­er­a­tions, shapes and space, pat­tern and func­tion, mea­sure­ment and data han­dling. They are also in­tro­duced to aba­cus and men­tal arith­metic, which have strong cul­tural sig­nif­i­cance in Chi­nese math­e­mat­ics.</p>
    <p>Ms Huang adds that phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion ac­tiv­i­ties are held once a week, where the chil­dren de­velop mo­tor skills and learn to co­op­er­ate in groups.</p>
