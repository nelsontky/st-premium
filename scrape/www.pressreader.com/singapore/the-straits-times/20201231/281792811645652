    <p>Covid-19 will not be the world’s last pan­demic. Many of us may even live to see the next one, but we are un­likely to be any more pre­pared for it than we were for this one.</p>
    <p>That is the bleak opin­ion of Dr Kenneth Iser­son, pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus of emer­gency medicine at the Univer­sity of Ari­zona in the United States, who spe­cialises in global and dis­as­ter medicine.</p>
    <p>The world is al­ready see­ing a num­ber of new dis­eases that could po­ten­tially de­velop into Dis­ease X, Dr Iser­son told The Straits Times, re­fer­ring to a place­holder name that ac­knowl­edges the like­li­hood of a se­vere in­fec­tious dis­ease still un­known to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>“There are prob­a­bly other un­recog­nised in­fec­tious dis­eases al­ready in cir­cu­la­tion that can have dev­as­tat­ing im­pli­ca­tions. But the dis­parate, po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated and un­co­or­di­nated re­sponse to Covid-19 sug­gests that we have not learnt much that will pre­pare us for fu­ture pan­demics.”</p>
    <p>Dis­ease X is one of a dozen deadly pathogens, in­clud­ing the se­vere acute re­s­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) and Ebola, that the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion deems top re­search pri­or­i­ties, given their po­ten­tial to cause a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 is the Dis­ease X that plunged the world into cri­sis in 2020. But as na­tions roll out vac­cines de­vel­oped in record time in the new year, the next un­known, un­named en­tity may al­ready be lurk­ing.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines are not a cure-all. “Vac­cines and treat­ments are re­ac­tive rather than pre­ven­tive,” Dr K. Sri­nath Reddy, pres­i­dent of the Public Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia, told The Straits Times. “They are not an as­sured form of long-term pro­tec­tion. Mi­crobes, too, learn to mu­tate. More im­por­tantly, new pan­demics can start and wreak havoc be­fore we can de­velop vac­cines or test drugs against them.”</p>
    <p>The best pre­ven­tive mea­sures against the next pan­demic, Dr Iser­son said, is ac­tive in­ter­na­tional sur­veil­lance, es­pe­cially in hot spots for novel dis­eases, such as China, the Ama­zon basin and cen­tral Africa.</p>
    <p>“That takes ad­e­quate fund­ing, co­or­di­na­tion, and the po­lit­i­cal will­ing­ness to quickly pub­li­cise and act when new in­fec­tious agents are iden­ti­fied.”</p>
    <p>Yet, de­spite hu­man­ity’s best in­ten­tions, the “mem­o­ries of angst and so­ci­etal dis­rup­tion dur­ing Covid-19 will re­cede” and “our bul­warks against pan­demic dis­eases will re­main un­der­funded and in­ad­e­quate to the task” amid pol­i­tick­ing and red tape, the pro­fes­sor ar­gued in a commentary pub­lished in the Western Jour­nal of Emer­gency Medicine ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Dr Iser­son’s views, while pes­simistic, are based on the his­tory of the re­sponse to re­peated pan­demics over the mil­len­nia, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Sands, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and Malaria, refers to this phe­nom­e­non as “cy­cles of panic and ne­glect”, in which the world rushes to in­ject fund­ing in the wake of mas­sive out­breaks like Sars and Ebola, but cease their sup­port once they are con­tained.</p>
    <p>More­over, the global fo­cus on the cur­rent pan­demic may have un­wit­tingly shifted re­sources away from some ar­eas of re­search into pre­vent­ing the next one, even as it comes hurtling to­wards us, un­seen.</p>
    <p>On the bright side, although much of the world has thus far paid lit­tle heed to the im­por­tance of pre­vent­ing Dis­ease X, with its fo­cus firmly on bring­ing Covid-19 to heel, some govern­ments are al­ready think­ing sev­eral steps ahead, putting new plans – and more funds – into place.</p>
    <p>The US, for one, has com­mit­ted US$82 mil­lion (S$109 mil­lion) over five years to set up and sup­port the Cen­tres for Re­search in Emerg­ing In­fec­tious Dis­eases (Creid), a global sur­veil­lance net­work tasked with de­tect­ing the next pan­demic pathogen be­fore it leaps from wildlife into hu­mans.</p>
    <p>In an­nounc­ing Creid’s es­tab­lish­ment in Au­gust, the coun­try’s top in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert, Dr An­thony Fauci, made it clear that the coro­n­avirus cri­sis was a key driv­ing fac­tor.</p>
    <p>“The im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic serves as a po­tent re­minder of the dev­as­ta­tion that can be wrought when a new virus in­fects hu­mans for the first time,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The Creid net­work will en­able early warn­ings of emerg­ing dis­eases wher­ever they oc­cur, which will be crit­i­cal to rapid re­sponses. The knowl­edge gained through this re­search will in­crease our pre­pared­ness for fu­ture out­breaks.”</p>
    <p>In­dia, an­other ma­jor power, has raised fund­ing for mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary dis­ease sur­veil­lance sys­tems and boosted lab­o­ra­tory ca­pac­ity for such re­search work across the coun­try, as part of a 150 bil­lion ru­pee (S$2.7 bil­lion) pack­age for Covid-19-re­lated mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Govern­ment has com­mit­ted a record $25 bil­lion – 5 per cent of its 2019 gross do­mes­tic prod­uct – to a se­ries of plans chart­ing the coun­try’s re­search land­scape over the next five years, among which is a re­search pro­gramme for epi­demic pre­pared­ness and re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Pre­pare pro­gramme, re­searchers will work with oth­ers in the re­gion to keep a close watch on pathogens in an­i­mal pop­u­la­tions, fine-tune models to bet­ter un­der­stand how epi­demics can be con­tained, and en­sure that di­ag­nos­tics, treat­ments and vac­cines can be quickly read­ied when the next cri­sis strikes.</p>
    <p>Other in­ter­na­tional net­works, like the Global Virome Pro­ject, which seeks to de­tect the ma­jor­ity of the world’s un­known vi­ral threats to hu­man health, are con­tin­u­ing their ef­forts and pool­ing re­sources with ever greater ur­gency in the hope that hu­man­ity can learn every­thing there is to know about the next Dis­ease X be­fore it even oc­curs.</p>
    <p>Far more re­mains to be done, how­ever, with too lit­tle at­ten­tion cur­rently paid to some ar­eas most cru­cial in the work to pre­vent an­other pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On top of im­prov­ing eco-sur­veil­lance, Dr Reddy said, “we also need to stop de­for­esta­tion… and pro­mote plant-based foods, in pref­er­ence to ex­ces­sive con­sump­tion of an­i­mal foods, es­pe­cially those of ex­otic an­i­mal ori­gin as well as fac­tory-farmed live­stock and poul­try”.</p>
    <p>“If we main­tain eco­log­i­cal bal­ance and pur­sue the path of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, we will change our re­la­tion­ship with other life forms from harm to har­mony.”</p>
    <p>Per­haps a sil­ver lin­ing in the dark cloud of the hang­ing threat of an­other pan­demic is that even if – as Dr Iser­son pre­dicts – pol­i­tics and bu­reau­cracy even­tu­ally get in the way of the best in­ten­tions to pre­vent it, the world’s shared ex­pe­ri­ence with Covid-19 may still go some way in equip­ping it for the next global health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>A year ago, it would have been unimag­in­able that a vac­cine could be de­vel­oped from scratch, ap­proved by reg­u­la­tors, pro­duced in the mil­lions, and rolled out in mass in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paigns around the world in a mat­ter of months.</p>
    <p>That a host of sci­en­tists, politi­cians, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and drug man­u­fac­tur­ers around the globe have man­aged to by­pass the red tape, di­vi­sive pol­i­tick­ing and fund­ing is­sues that typ­i­cally plague the vac­cine-mak­ing process to pull that off in less than a year is proof of what in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion can achieve when there is a sin­gle­minded fo­cus.</p>
    <p>“We have to re­mem­ber why (Covid-19) was de­tected when it was,” Dr Josie Gold­ing, epi­demics lead at global health re­search fun­der Well­come, said. “It was be­cause there was ex­pe­ri­ence in (China) from Sars and from avian in­fluenza, there were sys­tems in place to de­tect strange pneu­mo­nia com­ing up.”</p>
    <p>Dr Gold­ing added: “Covid-19 is go­ing to put a lot of those sys­tems and ex­pe­ri­ence in coun­tries… The coun­tries who dealt with it bet­ter and faster at the be­gin­ning were the ones who had that his­tor­i­cal knowl­edge. I think that is go­ing to make a big dif­fer­ence when it comes to the next Dis­ease X.”</p>
    <p>ON­GO­ING BAT­TLE Vac­cines and treat­ments are re­ac­tive rather than pre­ven­tive. They are not an as­sured form of long-term pro­tec­tion. Mi­crobes, too, learn to mu­tate. More im­por­tantly, new pan­demics can start and wreak havoc be­fore we can de­velop vac­cines or test drugs against them. DR K. SRI­NATH REDDY, pres­i­dent of the Public Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia.</p>
