    <p>I feel very sad. They don’t see the im­por­tance and value of this place that de­serves to be pre­served. They chose not to make the two worlds live to­gether.</p>
    <p>MS PENPRAPA PLOYSEESUA­Y (above), the shrine’s care­taker, re­fer­ring to Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity, which owns the land.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK • In­side the shrine of Chao Mae Thap Thim in the Thai cap­i­tal Bangkok, a fig­urine of the sea god­dess Mazu sits in the cen­tre of a gold-framed al­tar of deities in a room fes­tooned with lanterns and Chi­nese scrip­tures.</p>
    <p>Out­side, a tall, newly erected metal fence stands be­tween the god­dess and a vast con­struc­tion site, where a dozen trucks and ex­ca­va­tors are wait­ing to move in and de­mol­ish the his­toric shrine once at the heart of the city’s Chi­nese mi­grant com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The stone li­ons that pro­tect the shrine may not be able to hold out much longer. Bangkok’s Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity, which owns the land, plans to con­struct two res­i­den­tial build­ings com­pris­ing 1,758 units, de­spite protests from its own stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“Sooner or later, they will cut the wa­ter sup­ply and elec­tric­ity,” said Ms Penprapa Ployseesua­y, the shrine’s care­taker of 25 years.</p>
    <p>Chao Mae Thap Thim is a rare hold­out against a wave of gen­tri­fi­ca­tion across one of Asia’s most vi­brant cap­i­tals, where change is be­ing thrust upon a melt­ing pot of com­mu­ni­ties that have for gen­er­a­tions re­sisted it.</p>
    <p>Ms Penprapa lives with her mother and two sons in a small house be­side the shrine and opens it to any­one wish­ing to pay their re­spects to the god­dess, or seek her guid­ance or bless­ings.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion work has i nter­fered with the shrine’s drainage sys­tem, some­times flood­ing it, and Ms Penprapa fears the height of the sur­round­ing fence means few peo­ple know it is still there.</p>
    <p>“I feel very sad. They don’t see the im­por­tance and value of this place that de­serves to be pre­served,” she said of the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“They chose not to make the two worlds live to­gether,” she added. “They only want us to get out.”</p>
    <p>A com­mit­tee is fight­ing the evic­tion and has sought a court in­junc­tion against it.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity, in a re­sponse to Reuters’ ques­tions, said it would build a new shrine at a space it has pre­pared at its Cen­te­nary Park “where (the shrine’s) grace and aus­pi­cious­ness will re­main with the com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>Ms Penprapa said a new site could not repli­cate the orig­i­nal charm of the cen­tury-old shrine, which moved to its cur­rent lo­ca­tion 53 years ago af­ter a fire.</p>
    <p>“We will re­sist as long as we can,” she said. “I know it won’t be easy.”</p>
    <p>The co­ex­is­tence of old and new is cen­tral to Bangkok’s char­ac­ter, but its sky­scrapers and con­do­minium clus­ters are eclips­ing its shab­bier side. A no­table ex­am­ple is the US$1.79 bil­lion (S$2.35 bil­lion) Icon­siam, a mega mall of en­ter­tain­ment and re­tail out­lets with panoramic river­side views where stilted houses and black­ened build­ings once stood.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­cited about the new vibe,” said tea shop owner Surin Sae-Ton, 50, whose busi­ness is across the river from Icon­siam.</p>
    <p>“But I don’t know how the com­mu­nity will be in fu­ture with this new pros­per­ity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kwang Tao, 62, who owns a Chi­nese medicine shop, also wel­comed the prospect of mod­erni­sa­tion. “This area used to have very good busi­ness, but in re­cent years it has gone down. That’s why peo­ple in this neigh­bour­hood are sell­ing their prop­erty,” he said.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tion ad­vo­cates say the mixed-up iden­tity that makes Bangkok so pop­u­lar is be­ing lost, and that the city must find so­lu­tions to care­fully man­age the changes.</p>
    <p>“This is the speed that no­body can con­trol, it is re­ally un­stop­pable,” said Ms Ni­ra­mon Serisakul, direc­tor of the Ur­ban De­sign and Devel­op­ment Cen­tre at Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“Some­times peo­ple for­get about other im­por­tant things, like how to pre­serve their her­itage.”</p>
