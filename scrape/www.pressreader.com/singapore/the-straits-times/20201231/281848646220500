    <p>The In­done­sian govern­ment has out­lawed the hard­line Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front (FPI) group no­to­ri­ous for its raids on bars and ho­tels dur­ing the Ra­madan fast­ing month and at­tacks on en­ter­tain­ment venues.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s chief se­cu­rity min­is­ter Mah­fud MD said yes­ter­day that the con­tro­ver­sial group has been of­fi­cially out­lawed with im­me­di­ate ef­fect.</p>
    <p>The Co­or­di­nat­ing Po­lit­i­cal, Le­gal and Se­cu­rity Min­is­ter said in a livestream­ed news con­fer­ence: “The govern­ment has banned FPI ac­tiv­i­ties and will halt any ac­tiv­i­ties held by FPI be­cause it no longer has le­gal stand­ing both as a mass or­gan­i­sa­tion and a reg­u­lar or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“If an or­gan­i­sa­tion acts on be­half of FPI, it must be con­sid­ered as non-ex­is­tent and re­jected due to the ab­sence of the le­gal stand­ing start­ing from to­day.”</p>
    <p>The FPI has been au­to­mat­i­cally dis­banded after its per­mit ex­pired on June 20 last year but it has con­tin­ued to carry out vi­o­lent acts and other con­tro­ver­sial ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Apart from its so-called “sweep­ing op­er­a­tions” against bars, broth­els and en­ter­tain­ment venues, FPI mem­bers have also car­ried out vi­o­lent as­saults against mi­nori­ties, such as Ah­madiyahs and Chris­tians. Though con­tro­ver­sial, the group and its leader Rizieq Shi­hab are in­flu­en­tial among con­ser­va­tive Mus­lims in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Newly ap­pointed Deputy Law and Hu­man Rights Min­is­ter Ed­ward Omar Sharif Hiariej yes­ter­day called on the public not to get in­volved in any FPI ac­tiv­i­ties and the use of its at­tributes and sym­bols.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­ward noted that 35 FPI mem­bers and for­mer mem­bers had been in­volved in ter­ror­ism, of whom 29 were found guilty of com­mit­ting the crime. Apart from them, an­other 206 had car­ried out other crim­i­nal ac­tions, and 100 of them were pun­ished, he added.</p>
    <p>A se­nior govern­ment of­fi­cial said this month that for­mer mem­bers of the dis­banded Mus­lim hard­line group Hizbut Tahrir In­done­sia (HTI) in West Java are be­ing wooed to join the FPI, and at­tend army-like train­ing for young re­cruits to be­come para­mil­i­tary troops.</p>
    <p>The HTI, which called for strict Is­lamic l aws i n In­done­sia and wanted to unify all Mus­lims into a caliphate, was out­lawed in mid-2017.</p>
    <p>FPI leader Rizieq, 55, re­turned to In­done­sia last month after spend­ing more than three years in Saudi Ara­bia in self-ex­ile, with thou­sands of his sup­port­ers throng­ing In­done­sia’s main air­port in Tangerang, Ban­ten prov­ince, to wel­come him on his re­turn.</p>
    <p>Police ear­lier this month killed six of his body­guards as they fol­lowed Rizieq in a ve­hi­cle con­voy. Police said these men il­le­gally pos­sessed firearms and tried to at­tack the of­fi­cers out­side Jakarta on Dec 7.</p>
    <p>Rizieq left for Saudi Ara­bia in 2017 after the authoritie­s started in­ves­ti­ga­tions into his in­sult of In­done­sia’s sec­u­lar state ide­ol­ogy, Pan­casila, and breach­ing pornog­ra­phy laws, after a pur­ported steamy ex­change with a sup­porter that in­cluded naked images of a woman</p>
    <p>cir­cu­lated on­line. Both in­ves­ti­ga­tions were dropped a year later.</p>
    <p>The public has long called for the dis­band­ment of the FPI through pe­ti­tions, cit­ing the di­vi­sion in so­ci­ety it has caused and re­li­gious­re­lated vi­o­lence, among other rea­sons. One pe­ti­tion in May last year was signed by more than 400,000 peo­ple re­quest­ing the Home Min­istry not to ex­tend the per­mit of the or­gan­i­sa­tion, which ex­pired on June 20 last year.</p>
    <p>The FPI was founded in 1998 after the fall of In­done­sia’s 32-year</p>
    <p>dic­ta­tor­ship un­der Suharto.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the fire­brand preacher Rizieq led a mas­sive sec­tar­ian move­ment against then Jakarta Gov­er­nor Ba­suki Tja­haja Pur­nama, pop­u­larly known as Ahok.</p>
    <p>Ahok, a Chi­nese-Chris­tian politi­cian, lost in the 2017 gu­ber­na­to­rial elec­tion against Dr Anies Baswedan, the cur­rent Jakarta gov­er­nor, and was later con­victed of blas­phemy against Is­lam, re­sult­ing in a two-year jail term.</p>
