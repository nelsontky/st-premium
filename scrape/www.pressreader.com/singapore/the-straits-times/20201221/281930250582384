    <p>The year is re­ced­ing with­out a sense of fi­nal­ity. The Covid-19 men­ace ex­tends into the next year and so too the un­prece­dented stress test for Amer­i­can democ­racy. This test is not yet over although it has been nearly seven weeks since the Nov 3 elec­tion in which Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump staked his per­sonal cred­i­bil­ity. Last Mon­day, pres­i­den­tial elec­tors met across 50 states and the District of Columbia and cast a 306-232 vote in favour of Mr Joe Bi­den. The process is but a for­mal­ity that does not merit much at­ten­tion. But this year it was closely watched be­cause Mr Trump con­tin­ues to cling to his un­proven claims that the elec­tion was fraud­u­lently won and presses on with ef­forts to re­sist the out­come.</p>
    <p>Days be­fore the Elec­toral Col­lege vote, more than half the Repub­li­can mem­bers of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives pe­ti­tioned the Supreme Court in an at­tempt to over­turn the elec­tion re­sults in the four swing states that clinched Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory. The at­tor­neys-gen­eral of 19 Repub­li­can-led states also af­fixed their names to the pe­ti­tion – which was tossed out by the court.</p>
    <p>But it ap­pears that Mr Trump is not done. A flut­ter of protest is likely again on Jan 6, when Congress meets to cer­tify the Elec­toral Col­lege votes. The Demo­crat-ma­jor­ity House will pre­vail but not be­fore Repub­li­can rep­re­sen­ta­tives will likely raise fruit­less ob­jec­tions. Even on Jan 20, when Mr Bi­den is sworn in, Mr Trump will likely in­sist that he won. Buck­ing tra­di­tion, he has not only re­fused to con­cede, but is also ex­pected to stay away from the in­au­gu­ra­tion and stage a ri­val event in Florida to launch his 2024 pres­i­den­tial bid. It would not be out of char­ac­ter for Mr Trump, who un­furled his 2020 bid within hours of his in­au­gu­ra­tion in 2017.</p>
    <p>There is also sound logic to his seem­ingly ir­ra­tional de­ci­sion to pro­long an al­ready lost bat­tle: It can ce­ment loy­alty with his voter base; main­tain his stand­ing within the Repub­li­can party; and at­tract funds to fur­ther his am­bi­tions. But his po­lit­i­cal show­man­ship and con­tin­ued pur­suit of per­sonal ben­e­fit do great dis­ser­vice to his na­tion. Un­der­min­ing pub­lic con­fi­dence that elec­tions were free and fair and re­fus­ing to ac­cord le­git­i­macy to the in­com­ing gov­ern­ment are no mi­nor blows to Mr Bi­den. They hand­i­cap him in the fight against the virus, in­clud­ing in the vi­tal task of per­suad­ing his coun­try­men to wear masks and get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who gar­nered 81 mil­lion votes, the most ever won by an Amer­i­can pres­i­dent, must re­main close to the ground in the face of Mr Trump’s re­sis­tance. To carry pub­lic opin­ion and re­cruit al­lies in Congress, his poli­cies on health­care, im­mi­gra­tion and taxes must also fac­tor in the as­pi­ra­tions of the 74 mil­lion who voted for his op­po­nent. By plac­ing con­sci­en­tious­ness be­fore am­bi­tion, he can do much to re­store dig­nity to pub­lic life af­ter the tu­mul­tuous Trump years.</p>
