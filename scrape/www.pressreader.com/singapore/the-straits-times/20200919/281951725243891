    <p>MP YEO WAN LING , ON THE BRIGHTLY COLOURED SHIP­PING CON­TAINER OUT­SIDE PUNGGOL 21 COM­MU­NITY CLUB BE­ING TURNED INTO A ONE-STOP DES­TI­NA­TION FOR JOB SEEK­ERS</p>
    <p>A brightly coloured ship­ping con­tainer out­side Punggol 21 Com­mu­nity Club has been turned into a one-stop des­ti­na­tion for job seek­ers and those look­ing for ca­reer ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Dubbed the Job Con­tainer, the fa­cil­ity was of­fi­cially launched yes­ter­day by MPs for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, and Punggol West MP Sun Xuel­ing.</p>
    <p>It will be open on week­days, and brings to­gether the ser­vices of Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s SGUnited</p>
    <p>Jobs and Skills Cen­tre, and Pro­ject Suc­cess, Sin­ga­pore’s first com­mu­nity-led job place­ment cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The Job Con­tainer is meant to be a “safe space” for res­i­dents to talk about their ca­reer as­pi­ra­tions, said MP Yeo Wan Ling, who over­sees the Punggol Shore district.</p>
    <p>“Job­less­ness and re­trench­ments are very dif­fi­cult and sen­si­tive top­ics to talk about and, be­cause of this, I think we need to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties so that peo­ple can be very open about need­ing to seek help,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo was speak­ing to re­porters</p>
    <p>on the side­lines of a job fair in the com­mu­nity club, lo­cated in the Punggol Shore area.</p>
    <p>The one-day fair of­fered around 1,000 va­can­cies in in­dus­tries such as health­care and food and bev­er­age.</p>
    <p>Added MP Sharael Taha, who is in charge of the Pasir Ris East area: “A lot of res­i­dents are work­ing in aerospace or other in­dus­tries that have been af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“So job fairs like this al­low us to bring jobs closer to res­i­dents, and hope­fully can help res­i­dents through these dif­fi­cult times.”</p>
    <p>Both MPs launched the Job Con­tainer along with Se­nior Min­is­ter Teo Chee Hean, Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Des­mond Tan, as well as Ms Sun, who is Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion and for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber, Ms Yeo’s Punggol Shore district will also be launch­ing a direc­tory for free­lancers called PS Lvbang. It aims to al­low free­lancers to ad­ver­tise their ser­vices to res­i­dents. More de­tails will be re­leased next month.</p>
    <p>One Punggol res­i­dent at the job fair was Ms Ang Ai Lian, 45, who is look­ing to make a mid-ca­reer switch to the health­care sec­tor.</p>
    <p>She de­cided to take a break from her ac­count­ing work a year ago, be­fore vol­un­teer­ing as an op­er­a­tions sup­port as­so­ciate help­ing to care for Covid-19 pa­tients at the Sin­ga­pore Expo.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised I re­ally like the work. Ini­tially, your heart tells you that you want to do some­thing, but you dare not try it be­cause you’ve never done it be­fore,” Ms Ang said.</p>
    <p>“But right now, I know that this is some­thing I like, and that’s why I am here.”</p>
