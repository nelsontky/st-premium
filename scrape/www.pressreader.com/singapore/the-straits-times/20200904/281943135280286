    <p>Mr Joe Bi­den has a se­cret weapon in his bid for the United States pres­i­dency: He is the first Demo­cratic nom­i­nee in 36 years with­out a de­gree from an Ivy League univer­sity.</p>
    <p>This is a po­ten­tial strength. One of the sources of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s po­lit­i­cal ap­peal has been his abil­ity to tap into re­sent­ment against mer­i­to­cratic elites.</p>
    <p>By the time of Mr Trump’s elec­tion, the Demo­cratic Party had be­come a party of tech­no­cratic lib­er­al­ism more con­ge­nial to the pro­fes­sional classes than to the blue-col­lar and mid­dle-class vot­ers who once con­sti­tuted its base.</p>
    <p>In 2016, two-thirds of whites with­out a col­lege de­gree voted for Mr Trump, while Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton won more than 70 per cent of vot­ers with ad­vanced de­grees.</p>
    <p>Be­ing un­tainted by the Ivy League cre­den­tials of his pre­de­ces­sors may en­able Mr Bi­den to con­nect more read­ily with the blue-col­lar work­ers the Demo­cratic Party has strug­gled to at­tract in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, this as­pect of his can­di­dacy should prompt us to re­con­sider the mer­i­to­cratic po­lit­i­cal project that has come to de­fine con­tem­po­rary lib­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>At the heart of this project are two ideas: First, in a global, tech­no­log­i­cal age, higher ed­u­ca­tion is the key to up­ward mo­bil­ity, ma­te­rial suc­cess and so­cial es­teem.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, if ev­ery­one has an equal chance to rise, those who land on top de­serve the re­wards their tal­ents bring.</p>
    <p>This way of think­ing is so fa­mil­iar that it seems to de­fine the Amer­i­can dream. But it has come to dom­i­nate US pol­i­tics only in re­cent decades.</p>
    <p>And, de­spite its inspiring prom­ise of suc­cess based on merit, it has a dark side. Build­ing a pol­i­tics around the idea that a col­lege de­gree is a pre­con­di­tion for dig­ni­fied work and so­cial es­teem has a cor­ro­sive ef­fect on demo­cratic life.</p>
    <p>It de­val­ues the con­tri­bu­tions of those with­out a di­ploma, fu­els prej­u­dice against less-ed­u­cated mem­bers of so­ci­ety, ef­fec­tively ex­cludes most work­ing peo­ple from elec­tive govern­ment and pro­vokes po­lit­i­cal back­lash.</p>
    <p>Here is the ba­sic ar­gu­ment of main­stream po­lit­i­cal opin­ion, es­pe­cially among Democrats, that dom­i­nated in the decades lead­ing up to Mr Trump and the pop­ulist re­volt he came to rep­re­sent: A global econ­omy that out­sources jobs to low-wage coun­tries has some­how come upon us and is here to stay.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral po­lit­i­cal ques­tion is not to how to change it but how to adapt to it, to al­le­vi­ate its dev­as­tat­ing ef­fect on the wages and job prospects of work­ers out­side the charmed cir­cle of elite pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>The an­swer: Im­prove the ed­u­ca­tional cre­den­tials of work­ers so that they, too, can “com­pete and win in the global econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>Thus, the way to con­tend with in­equal­ity is to en­cour­age up­ward mo­bil­ity through higher ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The rhetoric of rising through ed­u­ca­tional achieve­ment has echoed across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum – from Mr Bill Clin­ton to Mr Ge­orge W. Bush to Mr Barack Obama to Mrs Clin­ton.</p>
    <p>But the politi­cians es­pous­ing it have missed the in­sult im­plicit in the mer­i­to­cratic so­ci­ety they are of­fer­ing: If you did not go to col­lege, and if you are not flour­ish­ing in the new econ­omy, your fail­ure must be your own fault.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to re­mem­ber that most Amer­i­cans – nearly two-thirds – do not have a four-year col­lege de­gree. By telling work­ers that their in­ad­e­quate ed­u­ca­tion is the rea­son for their trou­bles, mer­i­to­crats moralise suc­cess and fail­ure and un­wit­tingly pro­mote cre­den­tial­ism – an in­sid­i­ous prej­u­dice against those who do not have col­lege de­grees.</p>
    <p>By 2016, many work­ing peo­ple chafed at the sense that well-schooled elites looked down on them with con­de­scen­sion. This com­plaint was not with­out war­rant.</p>
    <p>Sur­vey re­search bears out what many work­ing-class vot­ers in­tuit: At a time when racism and sex­ism are out of favour (dis­cred­ited though not elim­i­nated), cre­den­tial­ism is the last ac­cept­able prej­u­dice.</p>
    <p>In the US and Europe, dis­dain for the less ed­u­cated is more pro­nounced, or at least more read­ily ac­knowl­edged, than prej­u­dice against other dis­favoured groups.</p>
    <p>In a se­ries of sur­veys con­ducted in the US, Bri­tain, the Nether­lands and Bel­gium, a team of so­cial psy­chol­o­gists led by Dr Toon Kup­pens found that col­lege-ed­u­cated re­spon­dents had more bias against less-ed­u­cated peo­ple than they did against other dis­favoured groups.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers sur­veyed at­ti­tudes to­wards a range of peo­ple who are typ­i­cally vic­tims of dis­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>In Europe, this list in­cluded Mus­lims and peo­ple who are poor, obese, blind and less ed­u­cated; in the US, the list also in­cluded African Amer­i­cans and the work­ing class.</p>
    <p>Of all these groups, the poorly ed­u­cated were dis­liked most of all.</p>
    <p>The study also found that elites are un­em­bar­rassed by this prej­u­dice.</p>
    <p>They may de­nounce racism and sex­ism, but they are un­apolo­getic about their neg­a­tive at­ti­tudes to­wards the less ed­u­cated.</p>
    <p>By the 2000s, cit­i­zens with­out a col­lege de­gree were not only looked down upon; in the US and Western Europe, they were also vir­tu­ally ab­sent from elec­tive of­fice.</p>
    <p>In the US Congress, 95 per cent of House mem­bers and 100 per cent of sen­a­tors are col­lege grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>The cre­den­tialed few gov­ern the un­cre­den­tialed many.</p>
    <p>It has not al­ways been this way. Although the well-ed­u­cated have al­ways been dis­pro­por­tion­ately rep­re­sented in Congress, as re­cently as the early 1960s, about one-fourth of its elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives lacked a col­lege de­gree.</p>
    <p>Over the past half-decade, Congress has be­come more di­verse with re­gard to race, eth­nic­ity and gen­der, but less di­verse with re­gard to ed­u­ca­tional cre­den­tials and class.</p>
    <p>In the US, about half of the labour force is em­ployed in work­ing-class jobs, de­fined as man­ual labour, ser­vice in­dus­try and cler­i­cal jobs.</p>
    <p>But fewer than 2 per cent of mem­bers of Congress worked in such jobs be­fore their elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Some might ar­gue that govern­ment by well-ed­u­cated univer­sity grad­u­ates is some­thing to wel­come, not re­gret. Surely we want well-trained doc­tors to per­form our ap­pen­dec­tomies.</p>
    <p>Aren’t highly cre­den­tialed leaders best equipped to give us sound pub­lic poli­cies and rea­soned po­lit­i­cal dis­course? Not nec­es­sar­ily.</p>
    <p>Even a glance at the par­lous state of po­lit­i­cal dis­course in Congress should give us pause. Gov­ern­ing well re­quires not only tech­no­cratic ex­per­tise but also civic virtue – an abil­ity to de­lib­er­ate about the com­mon good and to iden­tify with cit­i­zens from all walks of life.</p>
    <p>But his­tory sug­gests lit­tle cor­re­la­tion be­tween the ca­pac­ity for po­lit­i­cal judg­ment and the abil­ity to win ad­mis­sion to elite uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>The no­tion that “the best and the bright­est” are bet­ter at gov­ern­ing than their less cre­den­tialed fel­low cit­i­zens is a myth born of mer­i­to­cratic hubris.</p>
    <p>If the rhetoric of rising and the reign of tech­no­cratic merit have led us astray, how might we re­cast the terms of moral and po­lit­i­cal as­pi­ra­tion? We should fo­cus less on arm­ing peo­ple for a mer­i­to­cratic race and more on mak­ing life bet­ter for those who lack a di­ploma but who make im­por­tant con­tri­bu­tions to so­ci­ety – through the work they do, the fam­i­lies they raise and the com­mu­ni­ties they serve.</p>
    <p>This re­quires re­new­ing the dig­nity of work and putting it at the centre of pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>It also re­quires re­con­sid­er­ing the mean­ing of suc­cess and ques­tion­ing our mer­i­to­cratic hubris: Is it my do­ing that I have the tal­ents that so­ci­ety hap­pens to prize – or is it my good luck?</p>
    <p>Ap­pre­ci­at­ing the role of luck in life can prompt a cer­tain hu­mil­ity: There, but for an ac­ci­dent of birth, or the grace of God, or the mys­tery of fate, go I. This spirit of hu­mil­ity is the civic virtue we need now.</p>
    <p>It is the be­gin­ning of the way back from the harsh ethic of suc­cess that drives peo­ple apart.</p>
    <p>It points be­yond the tyranny of merit to­wards a less ran­corous, more gen­er­ous pub­lic life.</p>
