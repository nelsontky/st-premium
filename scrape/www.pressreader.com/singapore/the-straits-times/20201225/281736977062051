    <p>There were mixed re­ac­tions when the virus hit early in the year – some peo­ple were wary, others com­pla­cent – but an army of front­lin­ers had been gear­ing up be­hind the scenes to keep Sin­ga­pore safe.</p>
    <p>When cases be­gan to rise, health­care work­ers were ready.</p>
    <p>They had been trained to use per­sonal pro­tec­tive wear and en­sure good hy­giene prac­tices to re­duce the chances of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Other es­sen­tial staff con­tin­ued to show up at work to keep things run­ning, de­spite the per­sonal risk it in­volved.</p>
    <p>Th­ese front-lin­ers had to make sac­ri­fices on other fronts. Nurse clin­i­cian Ab­dul Wa­hab, 54, saw his mother just three times this year be­fore she died last month.</p>
    <p>When his mum de­vel­oped heart fail­ure in Oc­to­ber, he was stuck be­tween want­ing to be by her side and keep­ing her safe from any­thing that might be on him.</p>
    <p>Mr Wa­hab and four others – Mr Ben­son Ng, a swab­ber for Covid-19 tests; Mr Nigel Quek, com­mand­ing of­fi­cer at Cer­tis’ In­te­grated Quar­an­tine Or­der Ser­vices; Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, co-de­vel­oper of Sin­ga­pore’s sole Sars-CoV-2 vac­cine now in hu­man tri­als; and Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin – have been nom­i­nated to rep­re­sent the army of peo­ple on the front lines of the Covid-19 bat­tle for The Straits Times’ Sin­ga­porean of the Year award.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to sign up as a swab­ber came af­ter his 58-year-old fa­ther’s brush with Covid-19 in March.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence that my fam­ily went through made me very de­ter­mined to do some­thing to fight the virus,” said 32-year-old Mr Ng, who is em­ployed un­der the Health Pro­mo­tion Board.</p>
    <p>Mr Quek, 34, said it has been grat­i­fy­ing to see hun­dreds of his of­fi­cers step up to over­see quar­an­tine or­ders, es­pe­cially dur­ing the peak of the pan­demic, when they had to deal with high num­bers in work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s Prof Ooi, 53, who spe­cialises in emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases, has been rac­ing against time to de­velop a vac­cine for the virus.</p>
    <p>Prof Leo helms the NCID, which be­came the nerve cen­tre of the coun­try’s bat­tle against its big­gest pan­demic less than six months af­ter the cen­tre of­fi­cially opened in Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>While the coun­try man­aged to bring com­mu­nity cases down, the work of front-lin­ers has yet to ease.</p>
    <p>“There are still a lot of un­knowns about the dis­ease, such as postCovid-19 syn­drome and re­ports of re­in­fec­tions,” said Prof Leo, 61.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know whether the virus will evolve and how the evo­lu­tions will af­fect us... We have to con­tinue re­search­ing and study­ing this.”</p>
