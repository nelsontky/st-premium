    <p>MANILA • The Philip­pines has de­cided to ban trav­ellers from 20 na­tions that have re­ported the new Covid-19 strain, Labour Sec­re­tary</p>
    <p>Sil­vestre Bello said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The travel ban cov­ers Sin­ga­pore, Aus­tralia, Bri­tain, Canada, China, Den­mark, France, Ger­many, Ice­land, Ire­land, Is­rael, Italy, Ja­pan, Le­banon, the Nether­lands, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Swe­den and Switzer­land, he said.</p>
    <p>The ban started at mid­night yes­ter­day and will be in place till Jan 15. It does not ap­ply to the whole of China, just Hong Kong, pres­i­den­tial spokesman Harry Roque said in a sep­a­rate brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Filipino work­ers re­turn­ing from these places are ex­empted from the ban, said the labour chief, who ex­pects as many as 100,000 more Filipinos to re­turn.</p>
    <p>The new strain – first de­tected in Eng­land – has not been found in the Philip­pines, ac­cord­ing to the</p>
    <p>De­part­ment of Health.</p>
    <p>Daily in­fec­tions rose by 886 yes­ter­day, the third straight day when the new case count is below 1,000 as test­ing also falls below tar­get.</p>
    <p>With a to­tal of more than 471,000, the Philip­pines has the sec­ond high­est cases in South-east Asia, next only to In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Manila has ap­proved Janssen Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals’ ap­pli­ca­tion to hold a clin­i­cal trial of its coro­n­avirus vac­cine in the coun­try, Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion di­rec­tor-gen­eral Eric Domingo said yes­ter­day. “In the next few weeks, we will be able to be­gin clin­i­cal tri­als,” Mr Domingo said.</p>
    <p>The trial ap­pli­ca­tions from Chi­nese firms Si­no­vac Biotech and Sichuan Clover Bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, and Pfizer’s ap­pli­ca­tion for emer­gency use for its vac­cine are still un­der re­view, he said.</p>
    <p>The new vari­ant, which Bri­tish sci­en­tists have called “VUI – 202012/01”, has re­newed fears about the virus that has killed over 1.7 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Philip­pine gov­ern­ment has sought another 540 bil­lion pe­sos (S$15 bil­lion) in fi­nan­cial sup­port from the cen­tral bank to mit­i­gate the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Na­tional Trea­surer Ros­alia de Leon said.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, the cen­tral bank agreed to lend the gov­ern­ment 540 bil­lion pe­sos. That fol­lowed a de­ci­sion in March to buy 300 bil­lion pe­sos of gov­ern­ment se­cu­ri­ties to help han­dle the fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic</p>
