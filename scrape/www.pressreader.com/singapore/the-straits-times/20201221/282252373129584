    <p>An Aus­tralian fugi­tive whose 2018 bat­tle in a Sin­ga­pore court against ex­tra­di­tion was over­ruled has been ac­quit­ted of the crim­i­nal charges he faced in a Syd­ney court.</p>
    <p>A New South Wales district court found Christo­pher Elkhouri not guilty of of­fences con­nected with re­birthing of mo­tor ve­hi­cles and deal­ing with the pro­ceeds of stolen goods, in a rare case of a fugi­tive be­ing ex­tra­dited and then ac­quit­ted in the state seek­ing ex­tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“I am not sat­is­fied beyond rea­son­able doubt of Mr Elkhouri’s guilt,” said Act­ing District Court Judge M. Adams in find­ing him not guilty of the four charges, in up­dated de­ci­sion grounds is­sued ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The judge noted that the Crown’s case in­volved Mr Elkhouri fa­cil­i­tat­ing car re­birthing ac­tiv­ity by re­ceiv­ing stolen mo­tor ve­hi­cles, or tam­per­ing with unique iden­ti­fiers to dis­guise or mis­rep­re­sent the iden­tity of a ve­hi­cle, among other things, at the Syd­ney premises over which he had con­trol and man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>But the court was “not sat­is­fied beyond rea­son­able doubt” that Mr Elkhouri was aware that any of the items shown had been in­ter­fered with or that he took part in any of the re­birthing ac­tiv­i­ties un­cov­ered by the po­lice ex­am­i­na­tion of items seized from the ware­house.</p>
    <p>Mr Elkhouri, 47, a busi­ness­man, was ar­rested in Sin­ga­pore in Jan­uary 2018 and held in re­mand for some nine months be­fore he was ex­tra­dited.</p>
    <p>A hear­ing was held in Sin­ga­pore in 2018 af­ter Aus­tralia sent an ex­tra­di­tion re­quest. Mr Elkhouri’s lawyer Ba­choo Mo­han Singh ar­gued he had not fled Aus­tralia in 2015, and po­lice there had am­ple time to ar­rest and ques­tion him then.</p>
    <p>District Judge Ong Luan Tze noted in her judg­ment grounds in July 2018 that “the con­duct be­ing al­leged against the fugi­tive would, if com­mit­ted in Sin­ga­pore, con­sti­tute the of­fence of ha­bit­u­ally deal­ing in stolen prop­erty un­der Sec­tion 413 of the Pe­nal Code”.</p>
    <p>She made clear the court’s role “in these pro­ceed­ings is not to de­ter­mine the guilt of the fugi­tive beyond a rea­son­able doubt, but sim­ply to in­quire whether a prima fa­cie case has been made out against the fugi­tive by cred­i­ble ev­i­dence”.</p>
    <p>She added that the task of re­solv­ing doubt as to the weight or qual­ity of the ev­i­dence and as­sess­ing the ev­i­dence should be left to the trial court. The judge found him li­able to be ex­tra­dited to face 24 of the 25 charges listed in the ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh, who prac­tises law in both Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia, sub­se­quently failed in a Perth-based Aus­tralian fed­eral court to block Aus­tralian pros­e­cu­tors from pur­su­ing the ex­tra­di­tion.</p>
