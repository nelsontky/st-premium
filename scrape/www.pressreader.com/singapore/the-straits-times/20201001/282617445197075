    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tress and ac­tivist Gabrielle Union (left) has reached a set­tle­ment with broad­cast net­work NBC fol­low­ing her ac­cu­sa­tions of work­place tox­i­c­ity on re­al­ity com­pe­ti­tion se­ries Amer­ica’s Got Tal­ent (2006 to present).</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old star of films like Bring It On (2000) was a judge on the se­ries last year, but was re­placed af­ter only one sea­son.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing her exit, Union told entertainm­ent mag­a­zine Va­ri­ety that she wit­nessed toxic be­hav­iour on set, such as racist com­ments from talk-show host and guest judge Jay Leno and a con­tes­tant who used black­face as part of his per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>She also re­counted an in­ci­dent in which fel­low j udge and se­ries cre­ator Simon Cow­ell smoked on a closed sound stage near Union, who is se­verely al­ler­gic to cig­a­rette smoke.</p>
    <p>She filed a ha­rass­ment com­plaint against the show in June and also said that for­mer NBC Entertainm­ent chair­man Paul Telegdy, who was re­cently ousted from the or­gan­i­sa­tion af­ter al­le­ga­tions of racist, sex­ist and ho­mo­pho­bic be­hav­iour, threat­ened her for speak­ing out against the work cul­ture at Amer­ica’s Got Tal­ent.</p>
    <p>The dust seems to have set­tled as NBC and Union said in a joint state­ment that the two par­ties have “reached an am­i­ca­ble res­o­lu­tion”.</p>
    <p>No de­tails were re­vealed, but entertainm­ent pub­li­ca­tion Dead­line re­ported that Union re­ceived “sig­nif­i­cant” com­pen­sa­tion from the net­work, ac­cord­ing to a source fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>NBC added in its state­ment that it “re­mains com­mit­ted to ensuring an in­clu­sive and sup­port­ive work­ing en­vi­ron­ment where peo­ple of all back­grounds can be treated with re­spect”.</p>
