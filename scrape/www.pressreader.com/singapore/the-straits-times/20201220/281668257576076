    <p>When blog­gers “mr­brown” Lee Kin Mun and Ben­jamin “Mr Miyagi” Lee joined forces in March for a vir­tual duet ti­tled “10 peo­ple, one me­tre, one Sin­ga­pore”, they prob­a­bly never imag­ined it would presage a near-defin­ing met­ric of ev­ery­day life in the na­tion for the rest of 2020.</p>
    <p>Their comedic take on the clas­sic 1990 Na­tional Day song riffed on the ini­tial limit of 10 peo­ple for social gath­er­ings, which later dropped to five. It will go up to eight on Dec 28 as Sin­ga­pore en­ters phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>“One me­tre”, on the other hand, has held firm as a ref­er­ence to a con­sis­tent, om­nipresent tenet of Sin­ga­pore’s suite of com­mu­nity mea­sures against the pan­demic: safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The term be­gan life as “social” dis­tanc­ing in Fe­bru­ary, when the au­thor­i­ties raised the Disease Out­break Re­sponse Sys­tem Con­di­tion (Dorscon) level from yel­low to orange and spoke of the need to min­imise phys­i­cal prox­im­ity by de­fer­ring or sus­pend­ing large-scale events.</p>
    <p>On March 13, the Health Min­istry stip­u­lated a 1m dis­tance to keep apart while in restau­rants and other public spa­ces.</p>
    <p>A week later, the min­istry switched to us­ing “safe” dis­tanc­ing as it an­nounced beefed-up mea­sures, in­clud­ing urg­ing work­from-home as the de­fault op­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore would con­tinue to es­ca­late safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, cul­mi­nat­ing in a two-month cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>New laws were passed in March to en­sure that any­one caught flout­ing the 1m rule would be fined, jailed or both.</p>
    <p>A study of news head­lines car­ry­ing the term “safe dis­tanc­ing” in past months saw no lack of bad be­hav­iour, with dozens of busi­nesses and hun­dreds of in­di­vid­u­als pe­nalised for non-com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands more have re­ceived warn­ings, and some for­eign­ers were per­ma­nently banned from work­ing in Sin­ga­pore af­ter gath­er­ing for drinks in Robert­son Quay.</p>
    <p>Con­tribut­ing to th­ese num­bers was the Gov­ern­ment’s OneSer­vice app which in April added an op­tion to re­port any­one vi­o­lat­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules. The au­thor­i­ties said there were 700 re­ports within two days of the fea­ture’s un­veil­ing.</p>
    <p>Red-shirted safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors, who help in­spect public spa­ces and re­mind Sin­ga­pore­ans to toe the line, have also been cursed at, as­saulted and even im­per­son­ated. But this new role aris­ing out of Covid-19 has also brought some re­lief to those hit hard by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A check of on­line ad­ver­tise­ments re­veals em­ploy­ers will­ing to pay up to $3,000 monthly for a con­trac­tual job the Los An­ge­les Times has de­scribed as akin to a school “mon­i­tor”.</p>
    <p>Th­ese am­bas­sadors’ ef­forts have been aided by per­va­sive strips crossed upon strips of bright duct­tape plastered on floors, chairs, ta­bles and other public in­fras­truc­ture to de­mar­cate 1m gaps.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s sub­se­quent du­al­phased re­open­ing in June saw dis­tanc­ing mea­sures still loom large.</p>
    <p>Even with phase three set to her­ald a fur­ther eas­ing of re­stric­tions in tan­dem with an en­su­ing vac­cine roll-out, the au­thor­i­ties have con­tin­ued to stress the need to fol­low safe dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures have had deep reper­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses have spo­ken out on the in­creased op­er­at­ing costs from up­keep­ing safe dis­tanc­ing. The hos­pi­tal­ity, en­ter­tain­ment and fit­ness in­dus­tries re­main mor­tally wounded by down­sized crowds.</p>
    <p>Vul­ner­a­ble seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion have been af­fected as well.</p>
    <p>The deaf, al­ready un­able to lipread due to masks, have strug­gled to pick up sounds emit­ted 1m away, even with hear­ing aids in place.</p>
    <p>For the el­derly, ex­perts point to neg­a­tive men­tal and phys­i­cal health ef­fects from the de­crease in in­ter­ac­tion and ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, safe dis­tanc­ing rules do not ap­ply to vir­tual and social media worlds – as demon­strated by lo­cal ini­tia­tive Friend­zone, which adopted a tagline of “safely dis­tant, so­cially con­nected” as it flipped the script from phys­i­cal to on­line-only events.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nity-build­ing group’s founders say this is dif­fi­cult but doable in a new nor­mal which, for the fore­see­able fu­ture, will re­main dot­ted with 1m in­ter­vals.</p>
    <p>“Let’s space out for Sin­ga­pore,” as mr­brown and Mr Miyagi sang. “That’s the way that we should be, Covid no more.”</p>
