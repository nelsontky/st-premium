    <p>Most Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) mem­bers un­der the Depen­dants’ Pro­tec­tion Scheme (DPS) will en­joy lower pre­mi­ums for a higher sum as­sured of $70,000 from April 1 next year. How­ever, mem­bers aged 55 to 59 will pay a higher yearly pre­mium of $298 as com­pared with $260.</p>
    <p>Most Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) mem­bers un­der the Depen­dants’ Pro­tec­tion Scheme (DPS) will en­joy lower pre­mi­ums for a higher sum as­sured of $70,000 from April 1 next year. Cur­rently, the sum as­sured is $46,000.</p>
    <p>Lower yearly pre­mi­ums in­clude a re­duc­tion of $51 for mem­bers aged 45 to 49 and a de­crease of $40 for mem­bers aged be­tween 50 and 54.</p>
    <p>How­ever, mem­bers aged 55 to 59 will pay a higher yearly pre­mium of $298 as com­pared with $260.</p>
    <p>Asked about the in­crease, a CPF Board spokesman ex­plained that the pre­mium rate per thou­sand-dol­lar-sum as­sured for mem­bers aged be­tween 55 and 59 had dropped by 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>This was the most com­pet­i­tive ten­der of­fered by in­sur­ers, which de­ter­mined that the pre­mium for this age group would be in­creased as the sum as­sured had risen sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>The max­i­mum age of DPS cov­er­age will also be in­creased to in­clude mem­bers aged 60 to 65, but at a lower sum as­sured of $55,000. Cov­er­age will be capped at age 65.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, DPS cov­er­age is capped at age 60.</p>
    <p>DPS is a term-life i nsurance scheme that gives in­sured mem­bers and their fam­i­lies a sum of money to get through the first few years af­ter the in­sured mem­bers die, or suf­fer from ter­mi­nal ill­ness or to­tal per­ma­nent dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>It is ex­tended au­to­mat­i­cally to CPF mem­bers who are work­ing Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens or per­ma­nent res­i­dents be­tween the ages of 21 and 60 when they make their first CPF work­ing con­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>There were about 1.9 mil­lion CPF mem­bers with an ex­ist­ing DPS cover as at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers aged be­tween 60 and 65 re­ceive a lower sum as­sured be­cause they are likely to have ac­cu­mu­lated suf­fi­cient CPF sav­ings or other sav­ings that can be be­queathed to their depen­dants to help them tide over a rea­son­able pe­riod of time in the event of a claim, a CPF Board state­ment said.</p>
    <p>They are also more likely to have fewer depen­dants who rely on their in­come, he added.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age, there is a re­duc­tion of about 47 per cent for the pre­mium per thou­sand-dol­lar-sum as­sured.</p>
    <p>These en­hance­ments to DPS are part of a re­view to bet­ter meet the needs of CPF mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Great East­ern Life has been awarded a five-year con­tract to ad­min­is­ter the DPS start­ing from April 1 next year.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers aged 60 and above but be­low 65 years, whose DPS cov­ers have ceased or will cease be­fore April 1 next year, can re­join DPS by ap­ply­ing di­rectly with Great East­ern Life when the new con­tract comes into ef­fect.</p>
    <p>They will pay $298 for an as­sured sum of $55,000.</p>
