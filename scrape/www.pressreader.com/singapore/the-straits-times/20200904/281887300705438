    <p>MOSCOW • The Krem­lin yes­ter­day re­jected ac­cu­sa­tions that Rus­sia had been re­spon­si­ble for the poi­son­ing of opposition politi­cian Alexei Navalny and said it saw no grounds for sanc­tions to be im­posed against Moscow over the case.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin was speak­ing a day af­ter Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel said that Mr Navalny had been poi­soned with a Soviet-style Novi­chok nerve agent in an at­tempt to mur­der him.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, 44, is an out­spo­ken op­po­nent of Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin and has spe­cialised in high-im­pact in­ves­ti­ga­tions into of­fi­cial cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>He was air­lifted to a hospi­tal in Ber­lin, Ger­many, late last month af­ter col­laps­ing on a do­mes­tic Rus­sian flight af­ter drink­ing a cup of tea – that his al­lies said was poi­soned – at an air­port cafe.</p>
    <p>Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow re­jected any sug­ges­tion that Rus­sia had been be­hind the at­tack on Mr Navalny and warned other coun­tries against jump­ing to hasty con­clu­sions.</p>
    <p>“There are no grounds to ac­cuse the Rus­sian state. And we are not in­clined to ac­cept any ac­cu­sa­tions in this re­spect,” he said, adding that there was there­fore no rea­son to dis­cuss sanc­tions against Moscow.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel has said that Ger­many would con­sult its Nato al­lies about how to re­spond to the poi­son­ing and that de­ci­sions on any sanc­tions against Rus­sia de­pended on Moscow’s re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union coun­tries yes­ter­day be­gan dis­cussing their re­sponse, but warned it was too early to im­pose new sanc­tions un­til an in­ves­ti­ga­tion iden­ti­fied the cul­prit.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia must carry out a “thor­ough, trans­par­ent” in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the case, which is only the lat­est episode in a long line of de­fec­tors and crit­ics of Mr Putin be­ing poi­soned in sus­pi­cious cir­cum­stances, EU for­eign af­fairs spokesman Peter Stano said.</p>
    <p>“We want to see those re­spon­si­ble brought to jus­tice, but for that, the in­ves­ti­ga­tion needs to be launched and needs to bring re­sults,” he said. “We are not there yet so it’s dif­fi­cult to speak about pun­ish­ment if you don’t have the (per­son) re­spon­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel faced grow­ing pres­sure yes­ter­day to re­con­sider the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will carry gas from Rus­sia to Ger­many, af­ter her state­ment on Mr Navalny</p>
    <p>Nord Stream 2 – which is set to dou­ble the ca­pac­ity of the ex­ist­ing Nord Stream 1 pipeline in car­ry­ing gas di­rectly from Rus­sia to Ger­many – is al­ready more than 90 per cent com­pleted and due to op­er­ate from early next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Peskov said the Krem­lin re­garded talk of tak­ing ac­tion against the pipeline as be­ing based on emo­tions. He said the project was a com­mer­cial one that ben­e­fited Rus­sia, Ger­many and Europe, and re­jected the premise that Rus­sia de­served to be sanc­tioned over the case.</p>
    <p>“We don’t un­der­stand what the rea­son for any sanc­tions could be,” Mr Peskov said.</p>
    <p>He said Rus­sia wanted to get to the bot­tom of what had hap­pened to Mr Navalny as well, adding that poi­son­ing him was not to any­one’s ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think that any­one could ben­e­fit from this,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sergei Naryshkin, head of Rus­sia’s For­eign In­tel­li­gence Ser­vice, said yes­ter­day that Moscow could not ex­clude that Western spe­cial forces might be be­hind Mr Navalny’s poi­son­ing.</p>
    <p>He added that no traces of poi­son had been found by Rus­sian doc­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny re­mains in the in­ten­sive care unit and on a ven­ti­la­tor at the Charite hospi­tal in Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors said that over time the body can clear out the nerve agent, which dis­rupts com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween the brain, the main or­gans and mus­cles, but that re­cov­ery is likely to be lengthy.</p>
    <p>BASE­LESS AC­CU­SA­TIONS</p>
    <p>There are no grounds to ac­cuse the Rus­sian state. And we are not in­clined to ac­cept any ac­cu­sa­tions in ’’ this re­spect.</p>
    <p>MR DMITRY PESKOV, spokesman for the Krem­lin, speak­ing a day af­ter Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel had said that a Soviet-style nerve agent was used against opposition politi­cian Alexei Navalny.</p>
