    <p>BANGKOK • Po­lit­i­cal tem­per­a­tures in Thai­land rose a notch yes­ter­day af­ter Par­lia­ment de­layed a bid to amend the Con­sti­tu­tion, en­rag­ing pro­test­ers who had gath­ered out­side to press the law­mak­ers into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers ha­rangued leg­is­la­tors de­part­ing Par­lia­ment as po­lice of­fi­cers linked arms to form a safe pas­sage for their de­part­ing ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The com­bined meet­ing of elected House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives and ap­pointed sen­a­tors had spent the past two days de­bat­ing six mo­tions to amend the Con­sti­tu­tion. One of the mo­tions – to form a char­ter draft­ing assem­bly – had been spon­sored by law­mak­ers from the gov­ern­ing coali­tion. Law­mak­ers were due to take a vote by yes­ter­day even­ing.</p>
    <p>But as the de­bate rounded up, mem­bers of the gov­ern­ing coali­tion led by the Palang Pracharath Party abruptly sup­ported a bid to form a spe­cial com­mit­tee to study the draft amend­ments. This was ap­proved by 432 mem­bers of the 750-seat Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Amid the ou­trage of op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers, Par­lia­ment pres­i­dent Chuan Leek­pai said: “There was no cheat­ing… We do our duty with sin­cer­ity for the ben­e­fit of the coun­try and the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The Con­sti­tu­tion was drafted un­der the pre­vi­ous mil­i­tary gov­ern­ment led by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, leader of the 2014 coup. It cre­ated a 250-mem­ber se­nate largely picked by the then rul­ing junta, and an elec­toral sys­tem that dis­ad­van­tages big par­ties like former elec­tion winner Pheu Thai.</p>
    <p>Though its draft was ap­proved via a na­tional ref­er­en­dum in 2016, it was amended at King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s re­quest in 2017.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s on­go­ing protests were started largely by youth who de­mand that the Con­sti­tu­tion be amended, that the Prime Min­is­ter step aside for fresh elections, and that the gov­ern­ment stop ha­rass­ing its crit­ics.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have also voiced a “dream” of hav­ing a monarch “truly un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion”.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the Con­sti­tu­tion amend­ment process would have been con­tentious, but at­tempts to amend it would have at least eased some of the po­lit­i­cal ten­sion that had been build­ing up over the past few months.</p>
    <p>A bid to amend Thai­land’s Con­sti­tu­tion was thwarted yes­ter­day af­ter Par­lia­ment abruptly de­layed a sched­uled vote that could have started the draft­ing process.</p>
    <p>In­stead, 432 mem­bers of the 750-seat Up­per and Lower Houses voted to form a spe­cial com­mit­tee to study draft con­sti­tu­tional amend­ments.</p>
    <p>The about-turn, com­ing af­ter a two-day de­bate, en­raged pro­test­ers who massed out­side to pres­sure law­mak­ers for change.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the joint sit­ting yes­ter­day even­ing, Par­lia­ment pres­i­dent Chuan Leek­pai said: “For some of you who feel like you were cheated, there was no cheat­ing… We do our duty with sin­cer­ity for the ben­e­fit of the coun­try and the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Much of the ire was di­rected at the 250 sen­a­tors who were largely ap­pointed by the former rul­ing junta.</p>
    <p>One-third of them are needed to back any char­ter amend­ment process to set it in mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Protest leader Arnon Nampa said: “If there is no progress on amend­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion by Oc­to­ber, peo­ple in the ru­ral ar­eas, sell your rice and come to stage a long protest to chase the dic­ta­tors out.”</p>
    <p>Some de­mon­stra­tors even made speeches on loud­speak­ers from a boat in Chao Phraya River to pre­vent sen­a­tors from leav­ing the Par­lia­ment com­plex via a nearby pier.</p>
    <p>An amend­ment at­tempt, had it kicked off, would have low­ered po­lit­i­cal tem­per­a­tures amid es­ca­lat­ing anti-gov­ern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent mass demon­stra­tion, over the past week­end, saw more than 30,000 peo­ple gath­ered in the heart of Bangkok near the Grand Palace.</p>
    <p>Protest lead­ers ad­dressed King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn di­rectly from the stage and tried to sub­mit a let­ter of de­mands to the pow­er­ful monarch.</p>
    <p>“As long as the amend­ment process is on­go­ing, it’s a re­lease valve for the present demon­stra­tions pop­ping up around the coun­try. There is hope and a venue for ne­go­ti­a­tion,” Dr Khemthong Ton­sakul­run­gru­ang, a law pro­fes­sor from Chu­la­longkorn University, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“If you shut this down, it will raise the stakes for the next protest, and the chances of clashes would be higher.”</p>
    <p>The cur­rent Con­sti­tu­tion is the re­sult of two draft­ing at­tempts un­der the pre­vi­ous mil­i­tary gov­ern­ment led by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chano-cha, a former army chief and leader of the 2014 coup.</p>
    <p>It cre­ated a 250-mem­ber ap­pointed Se­nate largely picked by the then rul­ing junta, and an elec­toral sys­tem that dis­ad­van­tages big po­lit­i­cal par­ties like former elec­tion winner Pheu Thai.</p>
    <p>The draft was ap­proved via a na­tional ref­er­en­dum in 2016, but was amended at King Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s re­quest in 2017.</p>
    <p>The gen­eral elec­tion last year re­sulted in a slim vic­tory for the cur­rent coali­tion gov­ern­ment led by Mr Prayut, but also the as­cen­dance of the youth-backed, one-year-old Fu­ture For­ward Party.</p>
    <p>It was the party’s dis­so­lu­tion by the Con­sti­tu­tional Court in Fe­bru­ary this year that sparked the cur­rent wave of protests.</p>
    <p>Leg­is­la­tors were due yes­ter­day to vote on six amend­ment mo­tions spon­sored var­i­ously by the gov­ern­ing coali­tion and the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>One of them, pushed by the gov­ern­ing coali­tion, sought to cre­ate a Con­sti­tu­tion-draft­ing assem­bly largely elected by vot­ers.</p>
    <p>For the mo­tion to have passed yes­ter­day, it needed a sim­ple ma­jor­ity from the 750-seat Par­lia­ment, and votes from at least one-third of the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Many groups have weighed in on this is­sue. On Tues­day, a hu­man rights group called In­ter­net Law Re­form Di­a­logue sub­mit­ted to Par­lia­ment what it terms a peo­ple’s con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment Bill backed by more than 100,000 sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, roy­al­ists led by former leg­is­la­tor Warong Dechgitvi­grom had turned up at Par­lia­ment to present a list of 130,000 names who op­posed any change to the char­ter.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the com­bined House sit­ting yes­ter­day, Se­na­tor Som­jet Bun­thanom, a re­tired mil­i­tary of­fi­cer, said: “I know well that if we al­low a new Con­sti­tu­tion to be drafted, it will worsen the di­vi­sions in so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Pheu Thai MP Sutin Klangsaeng, the chief op­po­si­tion Whip, ar­gued: “If now you still do not be­lieve this is the will of the peo­ple, have a look out­side Par­lia­ment today.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, gov­ern­ing coali­tion leg­is­la­tor Satit Wongnong­toey, who be­longs to the Demo­crat Party, tried to as­sure other law­mak­ers that at­tempts to amend the Con­sti­tu­tion would not touch the role of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>“I have hope that… we can con­tinue to work to­gether to clear con­flict from Thai so­ci­ety,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Dr Khemthong, amend­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion is “cum­ber­some, costly and in­ef­fec­tive” and likely to be a di­vi­sive process be­cause of the cur­rent po­larised en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“The pro­posal to cre­ate a draft­ing coun­cil was the eas­i­est be­cause ev­ery­one could post­pone the hard de­ci­sions.”</p>
    <p>With that process stymied for now, the pro­test­ers have warned that they may es­ca­late their ac­tions.</p>
