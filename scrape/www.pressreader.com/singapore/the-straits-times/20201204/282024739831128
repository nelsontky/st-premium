    <p>Ms Sher­maine Ang sug­gested the cre­ation of an of­fice to help se­niors who face dig­i­tal prob­lems (Set up of­fice to help se­niors the pre-dig­i­tal way, Nov 16).</p>
    <p>In its re­sponse, the Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion (MCI) listed the ap­proaches it is tak­ing to help se­niors cope (Multi-pronged ap­proach to help­ing se­niors cope with dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, Nov 27), which are mainly ways to teach se­niors how to go dig­i­tal, with­out ad­dress­ing Ms Ang’s sug­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>At­tend­ing a dig­i­tal class does not help an­chor the lessons learnt in that class. Of­ten, the steps are dif­fi­cult to re­mem­ber if one does not re­peat­edly use them, which se­niors are un­likely to do.</p>
    <p>More­over, the lower-in­come are be­ing asked to ac­quire smart­phones and data plans, which are not af­ford­able for those liv­ing in rental or one-room flats, even with the spe­cial rates avail­able to se­niors.</p>
    <p>Just as in­sti­tu­tions like the In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund Board con­tinue to pro­vide phys­i­cal of­fices to help those who are un­able to per­son­ally ac­cess dig­i­tal ser­vices, an of­fice as sug­gested by Ms Ang should be set up to help them.</p>
    <p>Staff could be de­ployed at com­mu­nity clubs to pro­vide such ser­vices to help se­niors.</p>
    <p>MCI’s re­ply also did not ad­dress Ms Ang’s con­cern for those who are il­lit­er­ate and have no close con­nec­tions to help them nav­i­gate dig­i­tal plat­forms.</p>
