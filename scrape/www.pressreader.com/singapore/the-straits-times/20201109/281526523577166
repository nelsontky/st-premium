    <p>Honk­ing of car horns and spon­ta­neous whoops from pedes­tri­ans erupted in Washington – the na­tion’s cap­i­tal – mo­ments after ca­ble news net­works called the US pres­i­den­tial election for Demo­crat Joe Bi­den at 11.24am on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Blocks from the White House, an on­go­ing rally to count ev­ery vote turned into a cel­e­bra­tion of the vic­tory won by Mr Bi­den and his run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of sup­port­ers spilt onto the streets wear­ing masks and Bi­den-Har­ris shirts. They held up hastily made signs as they danced and glee­fully posed for pho­tos be­fore an in­flat­able – and ad­mit­tedly un­flat­ter­ing – gi­ant bal­loon car­i­ca­ture of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>These scenes of spon­ta­neous cel­e­bra­tions were mir­rored in ci­ties across the United States, where vot­ers had been wait­ing anx­iously for votes to be counted and the race to be called for over three days.</p>
    <p>Trump sup­port­ers, too, gath­ered at state cap­i­tals across the coun­try, chant­ing “This isn’t over!” and “Stop the steal” as they car­ried Amer­i­can flags, Trump ban­ners and, in some cases, guns, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>Like the Pres­i­dent, many did not ac­cept the de­feat and echoed his claims – which even some Repub­li­can al­lies and lawyers have called base­less – that the Democrats had rigged the election and voter fraud was ram­pant.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who cam­paigned on a prom­ise to unite the frac­tured coun­try, will have the enor­mous task of try­ing to bridge the po­lit­i­cal di­vide.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing sup­port­ers of Mr Trump in his ac­cep­tance speech on Satur­day, Mr Bi­den said he un­der­stood their dis­ap­point­ment and ex­tended an olive branch: “Let’s give each other a chance. It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric.”</p>
    <p>He added: “To make progress, we have to stop treat­ing our op­po­nents as our en­e­mies. They are not our en­e­mies. They are Amer­i­cans.”</p>
    <p>It is now a time to heal, he said. “Let this grim era of de­mon­i­sa­tion in Amer­ica be­gin to end, here and now.”</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans also cel­e­brated VicePres­i­dent-elect Har­ris’ his­toric win. The 56-year-old Cal­i­for­nia sen­a­tor made his­tory as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman of South Asian de­scent, and the first daugh­ter of im­mi­grants ever to be elected to the vice-pres­i­dency in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>In Ms Har­ris’ ac­cep­tance speech, she paid trib­ute to the women who came be­fore her and made her vic­tory pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>She hon­oured her late mother Shya­mala Gopalan Har­ris, a breast can­cer re­searcher and civil rights ac­tivist who moved from In­dia to Amer­ica at the age of 19, whom she called “the woman most re­spon­si­ble for my pres­ence here today”.</p>
    <p>“I am think­ing about her and about the gen­er­a­tions of women, black women, Asian, white, Latina, Na­tive Amer­i­can women who through­out our na­tion’s his­tory have paved the way for this mo­ment. Women who fought and sac­ri­ficed so much for equal­ity and lib­erty and jus­tice for all,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Tonight, I re­flect on their strug­gle, their de­ter­mi­na­tion and the strength of their vi­sion, to see what can be un­bur­dened by what has been. I stand on their shoul­ders,” said Ms Har­ris, wear­ing a pantsuit in “suf­fragette” white in a nod to the fe­male ac­tivists who fought a cen­tury ago for the right for women to vote.</p>
