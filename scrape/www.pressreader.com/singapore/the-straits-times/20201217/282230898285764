    <p>JOBS IN ASIA-PA­CIFIC THAT WERE WIPED OUT BY THE PAN­DEMIC |</p>
    <p>GENEVA The eco­nomic blow from the coro­n­avirus has wiped out 81 mil­lion jobs across Asia-Pa­cific this year, with women and young peo­ple dis­pro­por­tion­ately af­fected, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion (ILO).</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has in­flicted a ham­mer-blow on the re­gion’s labour mar­kets,” Ms Chi­hoko Asada Miyakawa, the group’s re­gional di­rec­tor for Asia and the Pa­cific, said in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Low lev­els of so­cial se­cu­rity cov­er­age and lim­ited in­sti­tu­tional ca­pac­ity in many coun­tries have made it dif­fi­cult to help en­ter­prises and work­ers back on their feet.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ment in Asia-Pa­cific showed a 4.2 per cent de­cline com­pared with the pre-cri­sis trend, with the gap at 4.6 per cent for women and 4 per cent for men, the ILO said in a re­port.</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple have been es­pe­cially af­fected by work­ing-hour and job losses, the UN agency said, with the youth share of em­ploy­ment losses three to 18 times higher than their share of to­tal em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>With fewer paid hours of work avail­able, me­dian in­comes are fall­ing. Over­all, labour in­comes in the re­gion fell by as much as 9.9 per cent in the first three quar­ters of the year, equiv­a­lent to a 3.4 per cent drop in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, the ILO said.</p>
    <p>The re­gional j obs dis­par­ity is largely driven by South Asia, where the 2020 em­ploy­ment es­ti­mate is nearly 50 mil­lion jobs be­low the pre-cri­sis base­line, ac­cord­ing to the re­port. East Asia is es­ti­mated to see a gap of 16 mil­lion jobs, fol­lowed by South-east Asia and the Pa­cific Is­lands, with gaps es­ti­mated at 14 mil­lion and half a mil­lion jobs, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“Too many work­ers have been pushed back­ward into poverty,” the re­port said. “The re­gion’s economies, work­ers and en­ter­prises are strug­gling to bounce back from the cri­sis and to make progress to­ward in­clu­sive growth.”</p>
