    <p>A Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) of­fi­cer was con­victed by the dis­trict court yes­ter­day over his in­volve­ment in a rag­ging in­ci­dent that claimed the life of a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man (NSF) two years ago.</p>
    <p>Nazhan Mo­hamed Nazi, 42, was found guilty of act­ing neg­li­gently by fail­ing to pre­vent his sub­or­di­nates from car­ry­ing out the rag­ging ac­tiv­ity on the night of May 13, 2018.</p>
    <p>The sub­or­di­nates, who are SCDF ser­vice­men, had pres­sured Cor­po­ral Kok Yuen Chin, an NSF, to en­ter a 12m-deep pump well at Tuas View Fire Sta­tion that night to mark the im­pend­ing com­ple­tion of his na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Cpl Kok even­tu­ally drowned after he was pushed into the well by an­other ser­vice­man, Muham­mad Nur Fatwa Mah­mood.</p>
    <p>At the time of the in­ci­dent, Nazhan was deputy com­man­der of the sta­tion, while his col­league, Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, 40, was the com­man­der.</p>
    <p>Both men were orig­i­nally charged with one count each of in­ten­tion­ally aid­ing the ser­vice­men to cause griev­ous hurt to Cpl Kok via a rash act en­dan­ger­ing human life, which they con­tested.</p>
    <p>Those con­victed of this of­fence can be jailed for up to four years and/or fined up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>After a trial, Se­nior Dis­trict Judge Ong Hian Sun amended the charge that each man faced to one of per­form­ing a negligent act that en­dan­gered human life.</p>
    <p>The judge had noted that Chong and Nazhan were not present at the well and did not have the op­por­tu­nity to in­ter­vene or take pre­ven­tive ac­tion at the time.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they were obliged to en­sure Cpl Kok’s life was not en­dan­gered while he was on duty, the judge had said.</p>
    <p>While Chong had ad­mit­ted to the new charge, Nazhan had de­cided to con­test it.</p>
    <p>In their sub­mis­sions, Nazhan’s lawyers, Mr Singa Ret­nam and Ms Josephine Iezu Costan, ar­gued that Nazhan was un­aware that Cpl Kok would be pushed into the well as he had al­ready left the area by then.</p>
    <p>“Surely he can­not be held for any neg­li­gence re­gard­ing events that took place after he had left the scene,” they said.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Dis­trict Judge Ong dis­agreed, hold­ing that there was suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to con­vict Nazhan.</p>
    <p>Chong and Nazhan are ex­pected to be back in court on Sept 15.</p>
    <p>Both men can each be jailed for up to three months and/or fined up to $1,500 for their of­fences.</p>
    <p>The duo are also the last two in­di­vid­u­als to be dealt with in court over the tragedy. Three SCDF reg­u­lars, who were the pair’s sub­or­di­nates then, had ear­lier been con­victed and sen­tenced over their in­volve­ment in the in­ci­dent.</p>
