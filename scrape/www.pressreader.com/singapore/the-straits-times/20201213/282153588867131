    <p>Re­ports about an­i­mals en­ter­ing hu­man liv­ing spa­ces in Sin­ga­pore have been in the news again re­cently, for all the wrong rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Last month, a 50-year-old au­di­tor was at­tacked by a wild boar while ex­er­cis­ing in Sungei Api Api Park in Pasir Ris. The an­i­mal had emerged from some fo­liage and charged at her, leav­ing her with a 10cm cut on her left leg and fa­cial in­juries, which were treated in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, a 26-year-old tech­ni­cian took the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) and the Na­tional Parks Board to court for neg­li­gence, af­ter col­lid­ing with a large sam­bar deer while rid­ing a mo­tor­cy­cle in Up­per Thomson Road last year. LTA’s lawyers noted that there were “An­i­mals Ahead” signs in­stalled along the stretch and ar­gued that the rider ought to have known of the pos­si­bil­ity of an­i­mals in the area.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore de­vel­ops, mov­ing far­ther into nat­u­ral spa­ces to build more in­fra­struc­ture like hous­ing and roads, there will inevitably be greater con­cern over wild an­i­mals ap­pear­ing in pub­lic ar­eas. This is es­pe­cially so with the Min­istry of Na­tional Devel­op­ment’s aim to trans­form Sin­ga­pore from a “city in a gar­den” to a “city in na­ture” in the next decade.</p>
    <p>A NEW DY­NAMIC</p>
    <p>So far, Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety has been taught what to do if it en­coun­ters wildlife, with warn­ing signs erected in parks and pre­cau­tion­ary mes­sages re­peated in the me­dia.</p>
    <p>But per­haps there has to be a deeper par­a­digm shift in view­ing such in­ter­ac­tions with an­i­mals. There has to be a re­al­is­tic ac­cep­tance that we are now shar­ing a com­mon space.</p>
    <p>When peo­ple cross paths with an­i­mals in res­i­den­tial ar­eas, they can no longer view it as a mat­ter of wildlife “in­trud­ing” upon our space.</p>
    <p>Per­haps one good thing is that so­cial me­dia has en­abled the easy shar­ing of pho­tos and videos of wildlife sight­ings. Ot­ters, mon­keys, wild boars, chick­ens, horn­bills, you name it.</p>
    <p>This helps to nor­malise their pres­ence among us and serves as a con­stant re­minder that such en­coun­ters are be­com­ing com­mon and noth­ing to be shocked about.</p>
    <p>All these go to­wards shap­ing a na­tional mind­set that “wildlife” is no longer just re­stricted to “wild spa­ces”.</p>
    <p>PRE­CAU­TIONS STILL</p>
    <p>Let me stress that I’m not say­ing we should just give up and ac­cept that when we go to cer­tain places and en­counter wildlife, we will get in­jured. That is a fright­en­ing idea.</p>
    <p>In­stead, this is where mit­i­gat­ing mea­sures, like ed­u­cat­ing the pub­lic, play an im­por­tant role. Sen­si­ble ad­vice should be fol­lowed, such as:</p>
    <p>• Har­vest fruits from pri­vate gar­den­ing plots as soon as pos­si­ble so thiev­ing mon­keys will not de­scend on your premises;</p>
    <p>• Try not to go to a park where boars are known to roam, wear­ing the clothes you wore while cook­ing din­ner, as strong food smells might at­tract their at­ten­tion;</p>
    <p>• Do not go too close to a fam­ily of ot­ters mind­ing their own busi­ness, a painful les­son a five-year-old French girl learnt at the Gar­dens by the Bay back in 2017.</p>
    <p>Teach peo­ple what to do when, and not if, they run into an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>MAN­AGE­MENT STRATE­GIES</p>
    <p>Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng, who is also founder of the An­i­mal Con­cerns Re­search and Ed­u­ca­tion So­ci­ety (Acres), said: “Our strate­gies have al­ways been more about what do we do with the an­i­mals, but it should have a stronger fo­cus on how we cre­ate aware­ness among peo­ple, about the an­i­mals and about co­ex­is­tence.”</p>
    <p>He said a key is­sue is main­tain­ing the an­i­mals’ pop­u­la­tion num­bers, and the eas­i­est way is to sim­ply en­sure peo­ple do not feed them.</p>
    <p>Culling them should be a last re­sort as it re­in­forces the idea that hu­mans and an­i­mals can­not co­ex­ist, he said. “It has to be science-based. If you’re culling due to over­pop­u­la­tion, that is fine. If the culling is com­plaint-based, then no.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng shared in­for­ma­tion about the case of a mon­key that vis­ited Nee Soon a few years back. Groups like Acres and other agen­cies went around ad­vis­ing res­i­dents not to leave food ex­posed and not to look the mon­key in the eyes lest it felt threat­ened. With such pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures, the mon­key was soon gone from the area with­out any con­flict with res­i­dents, he said.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal­ist Sa­man­tha Thian, founder of so­cial en­ter­prise Seas­t­ain­able, said peo­ple need to start by ac­cept­ing both good and “ugly” an­i­mals. “For ex­am­ple, an­i­mals like wild boars and wild dogs are viewed neg­a­tively, as com­pared to horn­bills and ot­ters.”</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old also en­cour­aged peo­ple to take time to stop, ob­serve and un­der­stand the an­i­mals, rather than just view them neg­a­tively and with fear. Ms Thian, who or­gan­ises reg­u­lar beach clean-ups at East Coast Park, added that many of her peers are sup­port­ive of such ac­com­moda­tive mea­sures when it comes to wild an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>WILDLIFE ABODES</p>
    <p>It makes sense for real es­tate agents sell­ing prop­erty in com­mon wildlife zones to in­form their clients be­fore­hand of the crea­tures’ pres­ence.</p>
    <p>ERA real es­tate agent Keith Ong said this is­sue of wildlife-hu­man in­ter­ac­tion is still a rel­a­tively new one.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing wildlife nearby is a po­ten­tial sell­ing point as some peo­ple like to live near na­ture. He em­pha­sised that if any client asks about the pres­ence of an­i­mals, agents like him­self will be frank and tell them about sight­ings in the area. “We will ask if they are com­fort­able liv­ing in such con­di­tions. We won’t hide the truth,” he said.</p>
    <p>In es­tates which come to be known as “wildlife zones”, the au­thor­i­ties could make it known that cer­tain an­i­mals ex­ist and might ap­pear. In Hous­ing Board es­tates near wildlife habi­tats, an­i­mal ad­vi­sories should be pasted, along­side crime pre­ven­tion mes­sag­ing and Es­sen­tial Main­te­nance Ser­vice Unit hot­lines, to fa­mil­iarise res­i­dents with the an­i­mals and in­form them how to in­ter­act dur­ing en­coun­ters.</p>
    <p>The an­i­mals that live in our midst have equal rights to a peace­able life, as with hu­man res­i­dents. We should work to­wards find­ing a new nor­mal to share our liv­ing spa­ces with them.</p>
