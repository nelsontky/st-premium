    <p>• The un­prece­dented fall in green­house gas emis­sions from lock­downs dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic will do “noth­ing” to slow cli­mate change without a last­ing switch from fos­sil fu­els, an in­ter­na­tional team of re­searchers said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Global emis­sions from the burn­ing of coal, oil and gas could fall up to 8 per cent this year af­ter gov­ern­ments moved to con­fine bil­lions of peo­ple to their homes in a bid to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But ab­sent a sys­temic change in how the world pow­ers and feeds it­self, ex­perts warned in the study yes­ter­day that the emis­sions saved dur­ing lock­down would be es­sen­tially mean­ing­less.</p>
    <p>Us­ing open source data, the team cal­cu­lated how lev­els of 10 dif­fer­ent green­house gases and air pol­lu­tants changed in more than 120 coun­tries be­tween Fe­bru­ary and June this year. They found that pol­lu­tion such as that from car­bon diox­ide and ni­tro­gen ox­ides fell in the pe­riod by be­tween 10 per cent and 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given that the “mas­sive be­havioural shifts” dur­ing lock­down were only tem­po­rary, lower emis­sions so far this year are un­likely to in­flu­ence the cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Even as­sum­ing travel re­stric­tions and so­cial dis­tanc­ing con­tinue till the end of next year, the team con­cluded this would save only 0.01 deg C of warm­ing by 2030.</p>
    <p>“Lock­down showed that we can change and change fast, but it also showed the lim­its of be­hav­iour change,” said Pro­fes­sor Piers Forster, study co-author and direc­tor of the Pri­est­ley In­ter­na­tional Cen­tre for Cli­mate at Bri­tain’s Univer­sity of Leeds. “Without un­der­ly­ing struc­tural change, we won’t make it.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the 2015 Paris cli­mate deal, nearly 200 na­tions agreed to limit tem­per­a­ture rises to “well be­low” 2 deg C above pre-in­dus­trial lev­els through sweep­ing emis­sions cuts. It also set a safer goal of a 1.5 deg C cap.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions says that in or­der to keep 1.5 deg C in play, global emis­sions must fall 7.6 per cent an­nu­ally this decade. That is roughly equiv­a­lent to the an­tic­i­pated emis­sions fall this year. But given that it took one of the largest eco­nomic slow­downs in his­tory for this drop to hap­pen, Prof Forster said it was un­likely to be re­peated as na­tions look to re­cover.</p>
    <p>The study, pub­lished in Na­ture Cli­mate Change, also mod­elled op­tions for post-lock­down re­cov­ery which the au­thors said showed a unique op­por­tu­nity for struc­tural change to the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Op­tions for pol­i­cy­mak­ers in­clude low­er­ing traf­fic pol­lu­tion by pri­ori­tis­ing pub­lic trans­port and cy­cle lanes.</p>
    <p>A “strong green stim­u­lus”, which would see an ad­di­tional 1.2 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct in­vested in low car­bon tech­nol­ogy, could slash emis­sions by half by 2030 com­pared with a fos­sil fuel-led re­cov­ery, the au­thors said.</p>
