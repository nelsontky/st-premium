    <p>Straits Times Face­book users sug­gested that flights to nowhere may be for main­tain­ing pi­lot skills and planes, and not so much for mak­ing money for bat­tered air­line SIA. So eco-groups hop­ing to stop SIA from launch­ing them by of­fer­ing al­ter­na­tives may be dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>The house is on fire and needs to be saved – op­pos­ing camps de­bat­ing the mer­its of no-des­ti­na­tion flights agree on this. But one thinks the house is Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA), which is bat­tered by the Covid-19 cri­sis fall­out, while the other thinks it is Earth fac­ing a cli­mate cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Straits Times Face­book user Ray­mond Tan said: “So your house is on fire, but you ask the fire­men not to put out the fire be­cause the ex­tin­guisher in front of you has chem­i­cals and ask them to think of an­other way. Mean­while, your house is still burn­ing. That’s how rel­e­vant en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists sound right now.”</p>
    <p>But look­ing at the big­ger pic­ture – the big­ger “house” that is Earth – could make the en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists’ con­cerns rel­e­vant when you think of cli­mate refugees like fam­i­lies driven out of homes by rag­ing fires.</p>
    <p>ST Face­book user Matthew Chua Boon Hou said: “Have you seen the fires burn­ing in Western USA, Aus­tralia and Siberia even? Have you seen the ter­ri­ble hur­ri­canes hit­ting Florida and the in­creased num­ber of floods all over the world?</p>
    <p>“Let’s not kid our­selves, there is only one Earth. Un­less some aliens come to save us and bring us to an­other planet, we bet­ter stop all this non­sense be­fore the planet is com­pletely de­stroyed by us.”</p>
    <p>TIP OF THE (MELT­ING) ICE­BERG</p>
    <p>ST re­ported re­cently that SIA is plan­ning to launch a flights-to-nowhere cam­paign, with each flight tak­ing about three hours. In re­sponse to queries then, SIA said it is con­sid­er­ing sev­eral ini­tia­tives, and re­it­er­ated that “none of th­ese plans have been firmed up”.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem of in­creased car­bon emis­sions is just the tip of the ice­berg if SIA launches flights to nowhere, en­vi­ron­men­tal groups said in an ST re­port. Such flights are dif­fi­cult to jus­tify be­cause they do not pro­vide trans­port to any des­ti­na­tion, they added. Pro­duc­ing and later in­cin­er­at­ing used in-flight ameni­ties, such as face masks and sur­face wipes, also adds to car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>But peo­ple are gripped more by prob­lems that are in their face.</p>
    <p>Ter­ence Goh said: “It’s an is­sue with ‘far away wa­ter can­not save near fire’. That’s why des­per­ate move in any way that can make money for the com­pany to sur­vive first. Guess in this in­stance, any en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact be­came a sec­ondary con­sid­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>NG Chou Meng said: “I’m pro cut­ting down on car­bon emis­sions but it’s a mat­ter of sur­vival dur­ing this un­prece­dented pe­riod. Al­ter­na­tively, the en­vi­ron­ment groups may pro­pose bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>And they are try­ing to do so. Eco-groups said they un­der­stand that SIA is now fac­ing tough times amid the Covid-19 cri­sis, and it re­cently car­ried out a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise. They are crowd­sourc­ing al­ter­na­tive ideas from the pub­lic, to help SIA gen­er­ate in­come. They have re­ceived more than 1,000 re­sponses and plan to send them to SIA.</p>
    <p>NOT ABOUT MONEY?</p>
    <p>There are prob­a­bly lots of great, cre­ative ideas in the mix, but the flights to nowhere may have a value that is be­yond mak­ing money.</p>
    <p>Some ST Face­book users pointed out that it is also about main­tain­ing planes and fly­ing skills.</p>
    <p>OC Yeo wrote: “I don’t think this is about rev­enue... Think about this: Keep your cars parked for months with­out use – what you think that will do to the en­gines? Next: the pi­lots. Fly­ing a plane is not like driv­ing a car. They need to clock the hours to meet in­ter­na­tional reg­u­la­tions; or would you fly with a pi­lot who has not flown for months?</p>
    <p>“So if the planes and the pi­lots need to fly now in or­der to be ready when travel re­stric­tions ease off, might as well use those flights to gen­er­ate some rev­enue and cover costs of each flight very par­tially. So think first be­fore dis­miss­ing it.”</p>
    <p>There are sim­u­la­tors for train­ing, of course, but Ai Ghee Ong spec­u­lated: “SIA would have to do it – the flights to nowhere – with or with­out pas­sen­gers. Pay­ing pas­sen­gers is just a bonus. Won’t gen­er­ate any sig­nif­i­cant rev­enue any­way.”</p>
    <p>Well, we’ll see about that, since Qan­tas Air­ways said its seven-hour flight to nowhere sold out in 10 min­utes. But it does of­fer amaz­ing views as it will fly at low lev­els over Uluru, the Great Bar­rier Reef and Syd­ney Har­bour.</p>
    <p>Some ST Face­book users are up for it, like Myke Muk K C who is dream­ing of “a first-class ex­pe­ri­ence for those who can never af­ford it”. Al said: “Re­move all the chairs and con­vert it to party planes! Loud mu­sic and booze! Pretty sure there’s gonna be lots of book­ings.”</p>
    <p>Whoa, care­ful now, you will still need safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, though lots of book­ings will be (loud) mu­sic to the bat­tered air­line’s ears.</p>
