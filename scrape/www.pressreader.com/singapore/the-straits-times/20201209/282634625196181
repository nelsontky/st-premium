    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES The back­lash over Warner Bros’ plan to re­lease all its movies on the HBO Max stream­ing ser­vice in­ten­si­fied after one of Hol­ly­wood’s top di­rec­tors crit­i­cised the move.</p>
    <p>Christo­pher Nolan (left), who has a long re­la­tion­ship with the stu­dio, crit­i­cised the plan in a state­ment to The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter, say­ing the move made “no eco­nomic sense” and that “even the most ca­sual Wall Street in­vestor can see the dif­fer­ence be­tween dis­rup­tion and dys­func­tion”.</p>
    <p>Warn­erMe­dia, AT&T’s me­dia arm, shocked Hol­ly­wood last week by de­cid­ing to put its en­tire movie slate for next year on HBO Max at the same time the movies hit cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>It gave lit­tle warn­ing about the plan and its move sent shares of movie chains plum­met­ing. For ac­tors, di­rec­tors, pro­duc­ers and fi­nanciers tied to Warner Bros films, the ap­proach threat­ens to un­der­cut earn­ings.</p>
    <p>Nolan’s lat­est film, Tenet, was re­leased in cin­e­mas on Sept 3. And its dis­ap­point­ing box-of­fice tak­ings in the United States, where it made just US$57.6 mil­lion (S$77 mil­lion), was seen as a fac­tor be­hind Warn­erMe­dia’s de­ci­sion last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The straight-to-stream­ing plan af­fects big-bud­get films such as Dune, The Ma­trix 4, The Sui­cide Squad and Space Jam: A New Legacy.</p>
    <p>Sub­scribers to HBO Max, which was launched in May to com­pete with Net­flix and Walt Dis­ney’s Dis­ney+, will be able to see the movies at no ad­di­tional charge – an at­tempt to jump-start growth.</p>
    <p>Nolan, 50, told En­ter­tain­ment Tonight that he met the de­ci­sion with “dis­be­lief”.</p>
    <p>Works from top film-mak­ers and stars are “be­ing used as a loss leader for the stream­ing ser­vice – for the fledg­ling stream­ing ser­vice – with­out any con­sul­ta­tion”, he said.</p>
    <p>“So, there’s a lot of con­tro­versy. It’s very, very, very, very messy. A real bait and switch.”</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for the direc­tor – who also made Warner Bros movies such as Dunkirk (2017), In­ter­stel­lar (2014) and In­cep­tion (2010), in ad­di­tion to a suc­cess­ful Bat­man se­ries (2005 to 2012) – did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>In his re­marks to the Hol­ly­wood Re­porter, Nolan took the crit­i­cism fur­ther.</p>
    <p>“Warner Bros had an in­cred­i­ble ma­chine for get­ting a film-maker’s work out ev­ery­where, both i n theatres and in the home, and they are dis­man­tling it as we speak. They don’t even un­der­stand what they’re los­ing,” he said.</p>
