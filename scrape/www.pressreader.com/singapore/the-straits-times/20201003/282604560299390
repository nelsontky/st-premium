    <p>Loh has been a street artist since the 1990s and has had his work fea­tured in ap­parel and footwear col­lab­o­ra­tions with brands such as Sony and Nike since 2016.</p>
    <p>His lat­est tie-up with watch brand Ca­sio G-Shock in Jan­uary this year re­sulted in a new Year of the Rat watch, awash in aus­pi­cious red from watch face to strap.</p>
    <p>He says 15 years ago, the street art scene was less de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>Street art, which started in New York’s sub­ways through its grungy graf­fiti cul­ture in the 1970s to 1980s, grew from the ground up and be­came main­stream af­ter New York Post pho­tog­ra­pher Martha Cooper started doc­u­ment­ing it ex­ten­sively.</p>
    <p>To­day, so­cial me­dia and brand col­lab­o­ra­tions help give artists and de­sign­ers more vis­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“It’s mostly a win-win for now and the prospects are good,” says Loh, who notes that mil­len­ni­als and Gen-Z youth are more at­tuned to street art and de­sign, and they are also more will­ing to spend on prod­ucts in sup­port of artists and de­sign­ers.</p>
    <p>His re­cent works in­clude mu­rals at Far East Square (right).</p>
    <p>He heads his own cre­ative agency In­va­sion Stu­dios, which is a mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary art stu­dio. He de­clines to com­ment on his fees. Info: Go to www.face­book.com/ Jahan.Loh</p>
