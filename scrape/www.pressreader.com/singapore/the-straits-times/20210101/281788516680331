    <p>NO MORE</p>
    <p>The Se­nate is not go­ing to be bul­lied into rush­ing out more bor­rowed money into the hands of Democrats’ rich friends who don’t need the help.</p>
    <p>UNITED STATES SE­NATE LEADER</p>
    <p>MITCH MCCON­NELL, ap­pear­ing to shrug off Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ini­tia­tive to boost coro­n­avirus aid to Amer­i­cans by rais­ing re­lief cheques to US$2,000 (S$2,600) from US$600.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Se­nate leader Mitch McCon­nell has dealt a likely death blow to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s bid to boost coro­n­avirus aid to Amer­i­cans, de­clin­ing to sched­ule a swift Se­nate vote on a Bill to raise re­lief cheques to US$2,000 (S$2,600) from US$600.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell said on the Se­nate floor on Wed­nes­day that a Bill passed by the Demo­cratic-con­trolled House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, which sought to meet fel­low Repub­li­can Trump’s de­mands for big­ger cheques, “has no re­al­is­tic path to quickly pass the Se­nate”.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell, who con­trols the Se­nate’s agenda and op­poses the in­crease in aid, had in­tro­duced a com­pet­ing Bill com­bin­ing the US$2,000 cheques with pro­vi­sions un­ac­cept­able to Democrats, who could block it.</p>
    <p>With a new Congress set to be sworn in on Sun­day, the ac­tion ap­pears all but cer­tain to kill the ef­fort to in­crease the amount of the US$600 cheques Congress has al­ready ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Ap­pear­ing to shrug off Mr Trump’s own ini­tia­tive, Mr McCon­nell con­tin­ued: “The Se­nate is not go­ing to be bul­lied into rush­ing out more bor­rowed money into the hands of Democrats’ rich friends who don’t need the help.”</p>
    <p>Democrats have in­sisted the aid is for peo­ple in dire need of help in the face of a health cri­sis that has killed nearly 340,000 peo­ple in the United States, but Mr McCon­nell com­plained the cheques were not tar­geted at those in need.</p>
    <p>“Let folks vote. Mitch McCon­nell has the abil­ity to do that... He sim­ply is un­will­ing to do that and the</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can peo­ple are go­ing to be hurt,” Demo­cratic Sen­a­tor Gary Peters told CNN.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had ramped up pres­sure on fel­low Repub­li­cans to back the big­ger cheques for strug­gling Amer­i­cans in a se­ries of tweets over re­cent days. “$2000 ASAP!” Mr Trump wrote on Twit­ter early on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the Pres­i­dent at­tacked Repub­li­can lead­ers as “pa­thetic” and ac­cused the party of hav­ing a “death wish” if it did not back rais­ing the stim­u­lus pay­ments or scrap le­gal pro­tec­tions for so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Some Repub­li­can se­na­tors had sup­ported an in­crease in the pay­ments. They in­clude Mr David Per­due and Ms Kelly Lo­ef­fler, who face run-off elec­tions in Ge­or­gia next week that will de­ter­mine which party con­trols the Se­nate un­der Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
