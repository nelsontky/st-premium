    <p>A league ta­ble of re­tire­ment in­come sys­tems has again put Sin­ga­pore at top spot in Asia and sev­enth over­all. This comes amid con­cerns that the pan­demic will hit fu­ture pensions, with re­duced con­tri­bu­tions, lower in­vest­ment re­turns and higher gov­ern­ment debt, said the Mercer CFA In­sti­tute Global Pen­sion In­dex re­port.</p>
    <p>A global league ta­ble as­sess­ing re­tire­ment in­come sys­tems has again put Sin­ga­pore at top spot in Asia and sev­enth over­all.</p>
    <p>The rank­ing comes amid con­cerns that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic will hit fu­ture pensions, with re­duced con­tri­bu­tions, lower in­vest­ment re­turns and higher gov­ern­ment debt.</p>
    <p>The Mercer CFA In­sti­tute Global Pen­sion In­dex re­port ex­am­ined 39 re­tire­ment in­come sys­tems cov­er­ing al­most two-thirds of the world’s pop­u­la­tion us­ing a com­bi­na­tion of re­sponses gath­ered from May to July and pub­licly avail­able data. The Nether­lands led the way, fol­lowed by Den­mark and Is­rael.</p>
    <p>The in­dex, now in its 12th edi­tion, as­sesses each re­tire­ment sys­tem through ad­e­quacy, in­tegrity and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The ad­e­quacy cat­e­gory ex­am­ines a sys­tem’s ben­e­fits, de­sign, sav­ings lev­els and home own­er­ship, among other fac­tors, to de­ter­mine its abil­ity to pro­vide enough in­come.</p>
    <p>In­tegrity con­sid­ers fac­tors such as reg­u­la­tion, gov­er­nance, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and op­er­at­ing costs, while sus­tain­abil­ity mea­sures how likely a sys­tem will be able to pro­vide ben­e­fits in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ranked sev­enth for ad­e­quacy, 11th for in­tegrity and 12th for sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>It is Asia’s top re­tire­ment sys­tem, fol­lowed by Hong Kong and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Dr David Knox, se­nior part­ner at Mercer and the study’s lead au­thor, told a brief­ing last Fri­day that Sin­ga­pore ranked well as it has an es­tab­lished sys­tem – the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) – with good gov­er­nance and wide cov­er­age of all em­ployed Sin­ga­porean res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>“The CPF also has an an­nu­ity fo­cus, so you have an in­come-ori­ented sys­tem with money be­ing set aside for the fu­ture,” added Dr Knox in ref­er­ence to CPF Life, which pro­vides a life­long monthly pay­out once a mem­ber turns 65.</p>
    <p>The re­port noted that the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment im­ple­mented changes to the CPF scheme in 2016, in­clud­ing more flex­i­bil­ity in draw­ing down re­tire­ment pen­sion amounts and in­creases to cer­tain con­tri­bu­tion and in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also re­tained its “B” grade, in­di­cat­ing that it is a pen­sion sys­tem with a sound struc­ture but with ar­eas for im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong Chee Loong, who heads Mercer’s wealth busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore, said the sys­tem can be im­proved by re­duc­ing the bar­ri­ers to es­tab­lished tax-ap­proved group cor­po­rate re­tire­ment plans and in­creas­ing the age at which CPF mem­bers can ac­cess re­tire­ment sav­ings.</p>
    <p>“The sys­tem would also be for­ti­fied by open­ing the CPF to non-res­i­dents work­ing in Sin­ga­pore, given that they com­prise a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of the work­force,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong noted that the Gov­ern­ment has fo­cused on safe­guard­ing busi­nesses and Sin­ga­pore­ans amid the pan­demic and, in do­ing so, has also l ooked at main­tain­ing the strength of its pen­sion sys­tem, in­clud­ing de­fer­ring a planned in­crease in CPF con­tri­bu­tion rates for se­nior work­ers to Jan 1, 2022.</p>
    <p>It also an­nounced the CPF Tran­si­tion Off­set scheme, which will cover half of the in­crease in em</p>
    <p>ployer CPF con­tri­bu­tion rates for one year, and will be cal­cu­lated based on em­ploy­ees’ in­comes paid up to the CPF salary ceil­ing of $6,000 per month in 2022.</p>
    <p>The re­port said higher gov­ern­ment debt due to pan­demic sup­port mea­sures is likely to re­strict the abil­ity to sup­port older pop­u­la­tions through pensions or other ser­vices such as health or aged care.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Deep Ka­pur, direc­tor of the Monash Cen­tre for Fi­nan­cial Stud­ies in Mel­bourne, said: “The out­look for in­vest­ment re­turns is muted while volatil­ity may be el­e­vated, adding to the nor­mal chal­lenges of risk man­age­ment in a pen­sion port­fo­lio. Ad­di­tion­ally, some gov­ern­ments have al­lowed tem­po­rary ac­cess to saved pensions or re­duced the level of com­pul­sory con­tri­bu­tion rates to im­prove liq­uid­ity po­si­tions of house­holds.” He said these de­vel­op­ments will likely af­fect pen­sion sys­tems and in­flu­ence the in­dex in the next few years.</p>
    <p>The re­search project was spon­sored by CFA In­sti­tute, the global as­so­ci­a­tion of in­vest­ment pro­fes­sion­als, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Monash Cen­tre for Fi­nan­cial Stud­ies and global con­sul­tancy Mercer.</p>
