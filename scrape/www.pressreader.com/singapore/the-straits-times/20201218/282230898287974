    <p>NEW YORK Bit­coin has surged about 20 per cent this week, breach­ing US$22,000 for the first time and stir­ring pre­dic­tions that more gains lie ahead for the world’s largest cryp­tocur­rency.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal coin jumped as much as 4.6 per cent to about US$22,173 yes­ter­day, be­fore par­ing some of the ad­vance.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin and the wider Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto In­dex have both more than tripled this year.</p>
    <p>Cryp­tocur­rency-linked stocks in South Korea, Ja­pan and China climbed.</p>
    <p>The rally in dig­i­tal as­sets is po­lar­is­ing opin­ion, given bit­coin’s history of boom and bust.</p>
    <p>Pro­po­nents ar­gue that the cryp­tocur­rency is muscling in on gold as a port­fo­lio di­ver­si­fier amid dol­lar weak­ness and po­ten­tial in­fla­tion­ary pres­sure. Oth­ers see spec­u­la­tive fer­vour that will inevitably lead to a bust akin to the melt­down three years ago af­ter a fu­ri­ous bit­coin rally.</p>
    <p>Yet there are signs that longert­erm in­vestors like as­set man­agers and fam­ily of­fices are play­ing more of a role this time around, along­side trend-fol­low­ing quant funds.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin has al­most tripled this year, with the rally ac­cel­er­at­ing on Wed­nes­day af­ter breach­ing US$20,000 ear­lier for the first time.</p>
    <p>“We have a new line in the sand and the fo­cus shifts to the next round num­ber of US$30,000,” said Mr An­toni Trenchev, co­founder and man­ag­ing part­ner of Nexo, a crypto lender. This “is the start of a new chap­ter for bit­coin. It’s a nar­ra­tive the me­dia and re­tail crowd can prop­erly latch onto be­cause they’ve been no­tice­ably ab­sent from this rally”.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin has surged de­spite a se­vere crash in March that saw it lose 25 per cent amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Pro­po­nents have seized on the nar­ra­tive that the coin could act as a store of wealth amid sup­posed ram­pant cen­tral­bank money print­ing, even as in­fla­tion re­mains mostly muted.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, some Wall Street firms have taken a greater in­ter­est, with many seek­ing to cap­i­talise on its gains in a world of rock-bot­tom in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>Guggen­heim Part­ners, for in­stance, re­cently said it might in­vest up to 10 per cent of its US$5.3 bil­lion (S$7 bil­lion) Macro Op­por­tu­ni­ties Fund in a bit­coin trust.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin’s cross above the US$20,000 and US$21,000 lev­els were its lat­est mile­stones in re­cent weeks – the coin at the end of last month reached a new high three years af­ter set­ting a prior peak. It had traded at a few cents for sev­eral years af­ter its late 2008 launch by an un­known soft­ware de­vel­oper in the wake of the global fi­nan­cial crash.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple tend to pile into mo­men­tum trades, so bit­coin could have more up­side from here,” said Mr Ed Camp­bell, port­fo­lio man­ager and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at QMA.</p>
    <p>Peer coins also rose on Wed­nes­day, with the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto In­dex – which tracks some of the ma­jor cryp­tocur­ren­cies – gain­ing as much as 7.2 per cent. Dash and Lite­coin each ad­vanced at least 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ether, the sec­ond-largest dig­i­tal as­set af­ter bit­coin, rose as much as 6.9 per cent, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg, so much so that cryp­tocur­rency ex­change Coin­base said it was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing con­ges­tion is­sues and de­lays in send­ing the to­ken. Cus­tomers logged com­plaints about the ser­vice on the Down de­tec­tor web­site, which tracks out­ages.</p>
    <p>The rally fol­lows an an­nounce­ment by CME Group that it has plans to ex­pand its suite of cryp­tocur­rency de­riv­a­tives of­fer­ings to in­clude Ether fu­tures be­gin­ning in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>To Ms Mel­tem Demirors, chief strat­egy of­fi­cer at CoinShares, bit­coin’s cross above US$20,000 marks an im­por­tant psy­cho­log­i­cal mile­stone.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest thing is the macroe­co­nomic con­di­tions – this is the per­fect set-up for bit­coin,” she said by phone. “From here, things are go­ing to move very quickly and I wouldn’t be sur­prised if we touched US$35,000 in the next three to six months.”</p>
