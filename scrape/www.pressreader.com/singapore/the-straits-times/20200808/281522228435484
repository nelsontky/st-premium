    <p>In the green mas­ter­plan for the Sungei Kadut in­dus­trial area, work­ers can cy­cle to work from a new Mass Rapid Tran­sit (MRT) train sta­tion and en­joy “pocket parks” on the scenic route to their of­fices.</p>
    <p>Then at lunchtime, they will be able to un­wind at one of the many green spa­ces, ob­serv­ing mi­gra­tory birds such as the whim­brel for­ag­ing for food in mud­flats and wet­lands, just a hop and skip away from the district’s high-rise fac­tory build­ings.</p>
    <p>These are some of the early con­cept ren­der­ings by JTC Cor­po­ra­tion, which is work­ing on the re­vamp of the 500ha en­clave, one of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est in­dus­trial es­tates.</p>
    <p>The re­ju­ve­na­tion plans, which were un­veiled in Fe­bru­ary by Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, draws from Sin­ga­pore’s “City in Na­ture” vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The con­cept melds na­ture with the built en­vi­ron­ment to make Sin­ga­pore stand out, among global cities, as be­ing highly live­able while al­lay­ing the im­pacts of rapid ur­ban­i­sa­tion and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>The re­vamp com­prises five key de­sign strate­gies. These aim to re­duce the ur­ban heat is­land ef­fect; en­hance eco­log­i­cal cor­ri­dors; im­prove qual­ity of stormwa­ter runoff; fos­ter in­dus­try-land­scape syn­er­gies; and in­tro­duce ex­cit­ing life­style ac­tiv­i­ties in the area such as farm-to­fork din­ing serv­ing pro­duce from the agri-tech farms nearby.</p>
    <p>Sungei Kadut Eco-District is si­t­u­ated near the coast sur­rounded by wa­ter bod­ies and nat­u­ral habi­tats, in­clud­ing Mandai Man­grove and Mud­flat, Kranji Reser­voir and Sungei Pang Sua.</p>
    <p>Mr Ja­son Wright, direc­tor for de­sign at the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks), says: “The land­scape and green­ing ap­proach takes into con­sid­er­a­tion the ex­ist­ing bio­di­ver­sity that trans­acts through Sungei Kadut to­wards Sungei Bu­loh, iden­ti­fy­ing ex­ist­ing habi­tats for con­ser­va­tion as well as pro­pos­als to en­hance these habi­tats.”</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old was tasked to con­cep­tu­alise the bio­philic ap­proach to the green mas­ter­plan’s land­scape and de­sign.</p>
    <p>JTC and NParks be­gan dis­cus­sions early last year on the mas­ter­plan.</p>
    <p>A key fea­ture will be “na­ture ways” – path­ways with multi-tiered plant­ings that mimic the struc­ture of a for­est – that link pre­vi­ously frag­mented land­scapes and wildlife habi­tats such as Mandai Man­grove and Mud­flat, Kranji Reser­voir and parts of the for­mer Rail Cor­ri­dor (Kranji Cross).</p>
    <p>The area’s his­tor­i­cal ori­gins will also be em­pha­sised, such as its marsh and wet­land ar­eas, to make it more ac­ces­si­ble for vis­i­tors to ap­pre­ci­ate the man­grove habi­tats thriv­ing there.</p>
    <p>These plans will be car­ried out care­fully, with JTC con­duct­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact stud­ies next year.</p>
    <p>While the re­vamp will take up to 30 years to com­plete, Sungei Kadut has since last year started to trans­form its tra­di­tional man­u­fac­tur­ing bent and em­barked on nur­tur­ing im­por­tant new growth sec­tors such as agri-tech and en­vi­ron­men­tal tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“This is part of a larger plan to cre­ate a North­ern Agri-Tech and Food Cor­ri­dor which en­com­passes Sungei Kadut Eco-District, Wood­lands Re­gional Cen­tre, Wood­lands North Coast and Senoko Food Zone,” says Mr Shawn Tan, act­ing direc­tor for phys­i­cal plan­ning (North) at the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA).</p>
    <p>He adds that Sungei Kadut EcoDistric­t also presents a good op­por­tu­nity to im­prove the over­all trans­port con­nec­tions and ameni­ties in the area to bet­ter serve work­ers and res­i­dents in the larger north and west re­gions.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, more than 50 com­pa­nies have al­ready con­firmed in­ter­est in mov­ing into the new in­dus­trial fa­cil­i­ties, which span about 3.4 mil­lion sq ft and costs nearly $650 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to JTC.</p>
    <p>One of the high­lights of the de­vel­op­ment of this brown­field – or pre­vi­ously de­vel­oped – site is the cre­ation of clus­ters. This serves to boost syn­er­gies within the same in­dus­tries, max­imise land use, cut costs and cap­i­talise on re­sources by shar­ing fa­cil­i­ties and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>There are four main niches in Sungei Kadut: The Agri-Food In­no­va­tion Park for re­search and de­vel­op­ment, pro­to­typ­ing and high-tech farm­ing such as in­door farm­ing and aqua­cul­ture hatch­eries; Trendspace for fur­ni­ture and re­lated in­dus­tries; TimMac for tim­ber, metal and ma­chin­ery com­pa­nies; and Kranji Green for play­ers in waste man­age­ment and re­cy­cling.</p>
    <p>Fur­ni­ture and re­lated in­dus­tries have al­ready re­lo­cated last year to Trendspace. From next year, waste man­age­ment and re­cy­cling firms</p>
    <p>will move into Kranji Green, while tim­ber, metal and ma­chin­ery com­pa­nies will move into TimMac.</p>
    <p>Agri-tech firms set­ting up shop in the up­com­ing 18ha Agri-Food In­no­va­tion Park will look to em­ploy more Sin­ga­porean sys­tems en­gi­neers, plant sci­en­tists and aqua­cul­ture nu­tri­tion­ists.</p>
    <p>One of the firms in this emerg­ing sec­tor is Archisen, an agri-tech firm that makes and op­er­ates in­door farms, which is con­tem­plat­ing mov­ing to Sungei Kadut.</p>
    <p>Its co-founder and chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer Sven Yeo says the in­no­va­tion park’s shar­ing of re­sources and col­lab­o­rat­ing on R&D could be a game changer. “For ex­am­ple, one farmer is grow­ing mi­cro­greens and the other leafy greens, and they share a com­mon cus­tomer and are not di­rect com­peti­tors,” says Mr Yeo, 35. “There­fore, they could ag­gre­gate their pro­duce and sim­plify lo­gis­tics.”</p>
    <p>The agri-tech sec­tor will also play a key role in sup­port­ing Sin­ga­pore’s 30-by-30 goal of pro­duc­ing 30 per cent of its food by 2030 while the en­vi­ron­men­tal tech­nol­ogy sec­tor will con­trib­ute to­wards the na­tion’s Zero Waste goals.</p>
    <p>Ms Tang Hsiao Ling, JTC’s direc­tor of ur­ban de­sign and ar­chi­tec­ture, says: “The co-lo­ca­tion of these busi­nesses across in­dus­try sec­tors will cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for com­pa­nies to come to­gether to op­ti­mise re­sources and close the re­source loop.”</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, waste such as saw­dust gen­er­ated from tim­ber fac­to­ries could serve as a valu­able re­source for agri-tech com­pa­nies in the form of com­post,” says the 41-year-old. “This moves away from the in­ef­fi­cient lin­ear model of ‘take, make and waste’.”</p>
    <p>Apart from the four main niches, 200ha or 40 per cent of the land has been set aside for new growth in­dus­tries, which are ex­pected to cre­ate bet­ter-pay­ing jobs and at­tract more pro­fes­sion­als to the eco-district.</p>
    <p>“‘Kadut’ means ‘sack cloth’ in Malay,” says Ms Tang, adding that the new eco-district presents “great op­por­tu­ni­ties” for restor­ing and en­hanc­ing the ex­ist­ing ur­ban fab­ric.</p>
    <p>“It will also weave in the new face of man­u­fac­tur­ing, in­tro­duc­ing new threads of green, blue, eco­log­i­cal and mo­bil­ity cor­ri­dors, and stitch­ing to­gether new com­mu­ni­ties within its rich ta­pes­try.”</p>
