    <p>We thank Dr Yap Eng Chew for shar­ing his con­cerns, which have also been ex­pressed by other stake­hold­ers in the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) (NUS needs to clear the air about sacked don’s ac­tions, Oct 23).</p>
    <p>At NUS, aca­demics are free to en­gage in re­search and get their re­sults pub­lished, to teach in the class­room and ex­press them­selves on cam­pus.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they are ex­pected to do so within ac­cept­able schol­arly and pro­fes­sional stan­dards, as well as the reg­u­la­tions of the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>We also ex­pect all our fac­ulty and staff to hold them­selves to the high­est stan­dards and to abide by the NUS code of con­duct for staff. If they fall short, dis­ci­pline is swift.</p>
    <p>Dr Jeremy Fer­nando was dis­missed for a se­ri­ous breach of the code of con­duct for staff, which pro­hibits in­ti­mate re­la­tion­ships be­tween staff and un­der­grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>Given the se­ri­ous­ness of the al­le­ga­tions, NUS also filed a po­lice re­port and will con­tinue to aid in po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>My col­leagues in the NUS Vic­tim Care Unit and Tem­busu Col­lege pro­vided im­me­di­ate sup­port and care to the af­fected stu­dents, and will con­tinue to do so.</p>
    <p>Dr Fer­nando’s pa­per, Teach Me Tonight, ap­peared in his self-pub­lished 2017 book, Why Hasn’t JB Al­ready Dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>This book was not widely cir­cu­lated. In ad­di­tion, no red flags were raised at any time to the col­lege or the univer­sity in re­la­tion to his aca­demic work.</p>
    <p>While Dr Fer­nando is known to use metaphors to pro­voke dis­cus­sion, the anal­ogy of a sex­ual re­la­tion­ship be­tween a teacher and a stu­dent as part of the learn­ing process is un­ac­cept­able to NUS.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity will con­tinue to en­sure that all stu­dent ac­tiv­i­ties – across ed­u­ca­tion and stu­dent life – at Tem­busu Col­lege and at all of NUS’ res­i­den­tial col­leges ad­here to NUS reg­u­la­tions and are aligned with NUS’ val­ues.</p>
    <p>The safety and well-be­ing of our stu­dents and staff are of ut­most im­por­tance, and we re­main com­mit­ted to up­hold­ing this duty of care.</p>
