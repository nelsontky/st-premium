    <p>Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Eng Hwee has been cy­cling to work since he was chief plan­ner for the author­ity some 10 years ago.</p>
    <p>He is heart­ened by the up­trend in cy­cling and is hope­ful that more peo­ple will take to the “iron horse” when cy­cling in­fra­struc­ture be­comes more de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>At the URA, he has en­cour­aged fel­low col­leagues to find bik­ing bud­dies to cy­cle to work when they can.</p>
    <p>The URA of­fice in Maxwell Road is cy­clist-friendly, with shower fa­cil­i­ties and am­ple bike rests.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, 55, told The Straits Times that he has not cy­cled to work since the Covid-19 pan­demic be­gan as he has been work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>But, as re­cently as last year, he was cy­cling from home in the East Coast to work once a week. When he was chief plan­ner, he did so at least twice a week.</p>
    <p>He said his main mo­ti­va­tors were health and sus­tain­abil­ity. “It is a healthy life­style. I try to make time to go to the gym, but it is hard to keep to the rou­tine.”</p>
    <p>And, as an ur­ban plan­ner, Mr Lim is all too aware of the lim­i­ta­tions of mo­torised trans­port in a small and densely pop­u­lated city like Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Cy­cling is one of the most af­ford­able modes of trans­port. And on a bike, ev­ery­body is equal. And you don’t have to worry about the last mile,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that stud­ies have shown that most com­mutes here are 5km or less, and hence can be done on bi­cy­cles eas­ily.</p>
    <p>“If you cy­cle for less than 5km, you hardly sweat,” he said.</p>
    <p>The URA chief reck­ons more peo­ple will be en­cour­aged to cy­cle once Sin­ga­pore’s am­bi­tious cy­cling path net­work plans are com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The URA said the lat­est tar­get is to have 1,320km of cy­cling paths and park con­nec­tors by 2030 – nearly tre­ble the net­work length to­day.</p>
    <p>“If we have safe in­fra­struc­ture, we can give peo­ple a choice to cy­cle, maybe as leisure to be­gin with,”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>He added that he uses park con­nec­tors and cy­cling paths 90 per cent of the time on the way to work.</p>
    <p>As for on-road cy­cling lanes, Mr Lim said they posed a “high risk”.</p>
    <p>“Most peo­ple are not com­fort­able cy­cling along­side cars. And the mo­ment there is an in­ci­dent, it will gen­er­ate bad press, and change the course of our ob­jec­tive,” he said.</p>
    <p>Space con­straint is an­other is­sue, but Mr Lim noted that plan­ners were able to ac­com­mo­date one when they de­signed the new ex­tended Tanah Merah Coast Road.</p>
