    <p>We re­fer to the let­ters “Take steps to pro­tect in­vestors from be­ing burned” (Aug 6); “Too many reg­u­la­tions will hurt Sin­ga­pore mar­ket and in­vestors” (Aug 8); and “Fi­nan­cial lit­er­acy paramount in cur­rent mar­ket cli­mate” (Aug 11). We thank the writ­ers for their views.</p>
    <p>We agree with Mr Ee Teck Siew that mea­sures should be in place to guard against re­tail in­vestors in­vest­ing be­yond their knowl­edge, risk ap­petite and fi­nan­cial re­sources. Ms Christie Loh is also right on the need to avoid bur­den­some reg­u­la­tions that im­pede the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures sim­i­lar to Mr Ee’s sug­ges­tions have been im­ple­mented to raise in­vestors’ aware­ness of the risks of stock trad­ing and re­spon­si­ble in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­ri­ties bro­kers are re­quired to in­form re­tail in­vestors about the rel­e­vant risks of trad­ing and ob­tain a writ­ten ac­knowl­edge­ment from the in­vestor be­fore open­ing a trad­ing ac­count.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing and credit lim­its may only be granted after tak­ing the fi­nan­cial cir­cum­stances of the in­vestor into ac­count. There are also reg­u­la­tory caps on the amount of se­cu­ri­ties fi­nanc­ing which can be pro­vided to re­tail in­vestors.</p>
    <p>As Mr Woon Wee Min pointed out, fi­nan­cial lit­er­acy is paramount in help­ing in­vestors man­age their in­vest­ments ef­fec­tively and avoid huge losses. The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) has been spear­head­ing ef­forts to raise the gen­eral level of fi­nan­cial and in­vest­ment lit­er­acy through its national fi­nan­cial education pro­gramme, MoneySense, and its in­dus­try part­ners.</p>
    <p>Mr Ee men­tioned ap­ply­ing cir­cuit break­ers to lower-priced stocks. While these can be use­ful tools to pre­vent ex­ces­sive volatil­ity and as­sist in main­tain­ing an or­derly mar­ket, their use can also un­der­mine proper price dis­cov­ery, which is driven by mar­ket fun­da­men­tals.</p>
    <p>Lower-priced stocks that are less liq­uid can ex­hibit sharper price move­ments when there are ma­te­rial cor­po­rate or mar­ket developmen­ts.</p>
    <p>Us­ing cir­cuit break­ers too quickly in such si­t­u­a­tions could de­lay price dis­cov­ery. But we note Mr Ee’s points and will en­gage the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) to re­view the use of cir­cuit break­ers to­gether with other tools it uses to main­tain a fair and or­derly mar­ket.</p>
    <p>MAS and SGX have put in place a frame­work of reg­u­la­tory safe­guards. In­vestors too have an im­por­tant part to play by be­ing vig­i­lant. They should main­tain a long-term per­spec­tive to in­vest­ments and fully un­der­stand the risks they are tak­ing. Jerome Lee</p>
