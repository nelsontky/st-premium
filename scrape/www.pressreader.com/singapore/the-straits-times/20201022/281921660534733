    <p>The good Lord works in mys­te­ri­ous ways. He (She?) threw a pan­demic at us at the ex­act same time as a tec­tonic shift in the way we will learn, work and em­ploy. Fas­ten your seat belt.</p>
    <p>When we emerge from this corona cri­sis, we are go­ing to be greeted with one of the most pro­found eras of Schum­pete­rian creative de­struc­tion ever – which this pan­demic is both ac­cel­er­at­ing and dis­guis­ing.</p>
    <p>No job, no school, no uni­ver­sity, no fac­tory, no of­fice will be spared. And it will touch both white-col­lar and blue-col­lar work­ers, which is why this pres­i­den­tial elec­tion mat­ters so much.</p>
    <p>The rea­son the post-pan­demic era will be so de­struc­tive and creative is that never have more peo­ple had ac­cess to so many cheap tools of in­no­va­tion, never have more peo­ple had ac­cess to high-pow­ered, in­ex­pen­sive com­put­ing, never have more peo­ple had ac­cess to such cheap credit – vir­tu­ally free money – to in­vent new prod­ucts and ser­vices, all as so many big health, so­cial, en­vi­ron­men­tal and eco­nomic prob­lems need solv­ing.</p>
    <p>Put all of that to­gether and KABOOM! You are go­ing to see some amaz­ing stuff emerge, some long-es­tab­lished in­sti­tu­tions, like uni­ver­si­ties, dis­ap­pear – and the na­ture of work, work­places and the work­force trans­formed.</p>
    <p>I have been dis­cussing this mo­ment with Mr Ravi Ku­mar, pres­i­dent of the In­dian tech ser­vices com­pany In­fosys, whose head­quar­ters is in Ban­ga­lore.</p>
    <p>Be­cause In­fosys helps com­pa­nies pre­pare for a dig­i­tal world, I have al­ways found it a source of great in­sight on global employment/ed­u­ca­tion trends. I started my book The World Is Flat there in 2004.</p>
    <p>Back then, In­fosys’ main busi­ness was do­ing work that Amer­i­can com­pa­nies would out­source to In­dia.</p>
    <p>To­day, Mr Ku­mar op­er­ates from New York City, where he is cre­at­ing thou­sands of jobs in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>How could that be? It starts with the fact, ex­plained Mr Ku­mar, that the In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion pro­duced a world in which there were sharp dis­tinc­tions be­tween em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees, be­tween ed­u­ca­tors and em­ploy­ers, and be­tween gov­ern­ments and em­ploy­ers and ed­u­ca­tors, “but now you’re go­ing to see a blur­ring of all these lines”.</p>
    <p>Be­cause the pace of tech­no­log­i­cal change, digi­ti­sa­tion and glob­al­i­sa­tion just keeps ac­cel­er­at­ing, two things are hap­pen­ing at once: The world is be­ing knit to­gether more tightly than ever – sure, the glob­al­i­sa­tion of goods and peo­ple has been slowed by the pan­demic and pol­i­tics, but the glob­al­i­sa­tion of ser­vices has soared – and “the half-life of skills is steadily shrink­ing”, said Mr Ku­mar, mean­ing that what­ever skill you pos­sess to­day is be­ing made ob­so­lete faster and faster.</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING – THE NEW PEN­SION</p>
    <p>Your chil­dren can ex­pect to change jobs – and pro­fes­sions – mul­ti­ple times in their life­times, which means their ca­reer path will no longer fol­low a sim­ple “learn-to-work” tra­jec­tory, as</p>
    <p>The Adap­ta­tion Ad­van­tage co-au­thor Heather E. McGowan likes to say, but rather a path of “work-learn-work-learn-worklearn”.</p>
    <p>“Learn­ing is the new pen­sion,” she said. “It’s how you cre­ate your fu­ture value ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>The most crit­i­cal role for teach­ers, there­fore, will be to equip young peo­ple with the cu­rios­ity and pas­sion to be life­long learn­ers who feel own­er­ship over their ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Ob­vi­ously, ev­ery­one still needs strong fun­da­men­tals in read­ing and writ­ing and maths, but in a world where you will change jobs and pro­fes­sions sev­eral times, the self-mo­ti­va­tion to be a life­long learner will be paramount.</p>
    <p>Par­al­lel to that, ex­plained Mr Ku­mar, ac­cel­er­a­tions in digi­ti­sa­tion and glob­al­i­sa­tion are steadily mak­ing more work “mod­u­lar”, bro­ken up into small pack­ets that are farmed out by com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies, he ar­gues, will in­creas­ingly be­come plat­forms that syn­the­sise and or­ches­trate these mod­u­lar pack­ets to make prod­ucts and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In the process, he added, “work will in­creas­ingly get dis­con­nected from com­pa­nies, and jobs and work will in­creas­ingly get dis­con­nected from each other”.</p>
    <p>Some work will be done by ma­chines; some will re­quire your phys­i­cal prox­im­ity in an of­fice or a fac­tory; some will be done re­motely; and some will be just a piece of a task that can also be farmed out to any­one, any­where.</p>
    <p>As more work be­comes mod­u­lar, digi­tised and dis­con­nected from an of­fice or fac­tory, many more di­verse groups of peo­ple – those liv­ing in ru­ral ar­eas, mi­nori­ties, stay-at-home mums and dads and those with dis­abil­i­ties – will be able to com­pete for it from their homes.</p>
    <p>The rea­son Mr Ku­mar now op­er­ates from New York is that he sees a huge new mar­ket in help­ing com­pa­nies in the United States to pre­pare for this world by iden­ti­fy­ing po­ten­tial new em­ploy­ees with skills – whether or not they have col­lege de­grees – then pair­ing them with new path­ways of on­line train­ing and pair­ing com­pa­nies with these new tal­ent pools.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery big com­pany is go­ing through this now – or will. Even</p>
    <p>The New York Times. Look at the list of on­line opin­ion writ­ers for</p>
    <p>The Times: It is rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent from when I be­came a colum­nist in 1995, when you had to be a staff em­ployee.</p>
    <p>To­day we have full-time staff colum­nists; colum­nists who are not on the staff but con­trib­ute reg­u­larly from all over the world, and on many days, one-time con­trib­u­tors.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple who mod­er­ate the com­ments on our col­umns are work­ers who plug in from all over the world, and much of the art is pro­vided by free­lancers. My long-time copy edi­tor is work­ing from home. Wel­come to the Times or­ches­tra.</p>
    <p>This is al­ready hav­ing a big im­pact on ed­u­ca­tion. “We have started hir­ing many peo­ple with no de­grees,” ex­plained Mr Ku­mar.</p>
    <p>“If you know stuff and can demon­strate that you know stuff and have been up­skilling your­self with on­line train­ing to do the task that we need, you’re hired. We think this struc­tural shift – from de­grees to skills – could bridge the dig­i­tal di­vide as the cost of un­der­grad­u­ate ed­u­ca­tion has in­creased by 150 per cent over the last 20 years.”</p>
    <p>In­fosys still hires lots of en­gi­neers. But to­day Mr Ku­mar is not look­ing just for “prob­lem solvers”, he says, but “prob­lem find­ers”, peo­ple with di­verse in­ter­ests – art, lit­er­a­ture, sci­ence, an­thro­pol­ogy – who can iden­tify things that peo­ple want be­fore peo­ple even know they want them. Ap­ple co-founder Steve Jobs was the ul­ti­mate prob­lem finder.</p>
    <p>Now so many more peo­ple can play at that, be­cause you no longer need to know how to code to gen­er­ate new soft­ware pro­grams. Thanks to ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, there is now “no-code soft­ware”. You just in­struct the soft­ware to de­sign some code for the ap­pli­ca­tion that you have imag­ined or need and, presto, it will spit it out.</p>
    <p>“We’re see­ing the democrati­sa­tion of soft­ware – the con­sumers can now be the creators,” Mr Ku­mar ex­plained. It shows you how ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence will take away jobs of the past, while it cre­ates jobs of the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, he ar­gues, in the fu­ture, post-sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tion will be a hy­brid ecosys­tem of com­pany plat­forms, col­leges and lo­cal schools, whose goal will be to cre­ate the op­por­tu­nity for life­long “rad­i­cal reskilling”.</p>
    <p>“Rad­i­cal reskilling means I can take a front-desk ho­tel clerk and turn him into a cy­ber-se­cu­rity tech­ni­cian. I can take an air­line counter agent and turn her into a data con­sul­tant.”</p>
    <p>JUST-IN-TIME LEARN­ING</p>
    <p>To­day, com­pa­nies like In­fosys, IBM or AT&T are all cre­at­ing cut­ting-edge in-house uni­ver­si­ties: In­fosys is build­ing a 40ha cam­pus in In­di­anapo­lis de­signed to pro­vide its em­ploy­ees and cus­tomers not “just-in-case learn­ing” – ma­te­rial you might or might not need to master the job at hand – but “just-in-time learn­ing”, of­fer­ing the pre­cise skills needed for the lat­est task, ex­plained Mr Ku­mar.</p>
    <p>In the fu­ture, life­long learn­ing will be done by what I call “com­plex adap­tive coali­tions”.</p>
    <p>An In­fosys, Mi­crosoft or IBM will part­ner with dif­fer­ent uni­ver­si­ties and even high schools, ar­gues Mr Ku­mar.</p>
    <p>The uni­ver­si­ties’ stu­dents will be able to take just-in-time learn­ing cour­ses – or do in­tern­ships – at the cor­po­ra­tions’ in-house uni­ver­si­ties, and com­pany em­ploy­ees will be able to take just-in-case hu­man­i­ties cour­ses at the out­side uni­ver­si­ties. Both will be able to “learn, earn and work”, all at the same time.</p>
    <p>It is al­ready be­gin­ning. There is great po­ten­tial here – if it is done right. The stu­dents get ex­posed to what is most new by way of in­no­va­tion tech­nolo­gies and tech­niques.</p>
    <p>And the com­pany en­gi­neers and ex­ec­u­tives get ex­posed to what is most en­dur­ing – civics, ethics, the­o­ries of jus­tice, prin­ci­ples of democ­racy, no­tions of the pub­lic good, en­vi­ron­men­tal­ism and how to lead a life of pur­pose.</p>
    <p>Ob­vi­ously, ev­ery­one still needs strong fun­da­men­tals in read­ing and writ­ing and maths, but in a world where you will change jobs and pro­fes­sions sev­eral times, the self-mo­ti­va­tion to be a life­long learner will be paramount.</p>
