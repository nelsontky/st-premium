    <p>Ahead of One Cham­pi­onship’s closed-door Reign of Dy­nas­ties event on Fri­day, chief ex­ec­u­tive Cha­tri Si­ty­o­d­tong has re­vealed the safety pro­to­cols that will be in place to pre­vent the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>In a con­fer­ence call with the me­dia yes­ter­day, he talked about the mea­sures, which in­clude fre­quent test­ing, the cre­ation of a “bub­ble” and strict reg­u­la­tion of who can en­ter the event venue, the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium, on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing is new and we are work­ing very closely with var­i­ous agen­cies of the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment, so many agen­cies are in­volved with help­ing us,” he said.</p>
    <p>Overseas-based fight­ers will be tested four times – be­fore they fly to Sin­ga­pore, upon ar­rival, be­fore and af­ter the fight – while oth­ers will be tested twice.</p>
    <p>Out of the 12 fight­ers, five, who hail from Aus­tralia, China and Malaysia, have flown in for the event.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing tested upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, ath­letes, cor­ner­men and staff are re­quired to re­main in iso­la­tion un­til they re­ceive a nega</p>
    <p>tive test re­sult.</p>
    <p>Should any­one test pos­i­tive, Cha­tri said “the rel­e­vant pub­lic health mea­sures would ap­ply to the par­tic­i­pants as nec­es­sary”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of</p>
    <p>Health’s web­site, any­one with a pos­i­tive test re­sult will be con­tacted by the min­istry and a health­care provider, and trans­ported to a health­care fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>While they are in Sin­ga­pore, trav­el­ling is lim­ited to the event “bub­ble”. Train­ing is al­lowed, but only at pri­vate des­ig­nated ar­eas within the ho­tel and fight­ers will have to fol­low strict sched­ules.</p>
    <p>Cha­tri added that li­ai­son of­fi­cials will ac­com­pany ath­letes at all times.</p>
    <p>Reign of Dy­nas­ties will fea­ture six bouts and is the first live sports event that will be held in Sin­ga­pore since the pan­demic oblit­er­ated the Re­pub­lic’s sports cal­en­dar, which saw mar­quee events such as the For­mula One’s Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix, Sin­ga­pore Rugby Sev­ens and In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup axed.</p>
    <p>Fri­day’s event is head­lined by Thai­land’s Sam-A Gaiyang­hadao, who will de­fend his strawweigh­t muay thai world cham­pi­onship against Aus­tralian Josh Tonna.</p>
    <p>The mixed mar­tial arts pro­mo­tion’s last event here, King of the</p>
    <p>Jun­gle, which took place on Feb 28, was also held be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s di­rec­tor of sports Ong Ling Lee said: “We are pleased to work with One Cham­pi­onship to bring One: Reign of Dy­nas­ties to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“To­gether, we will test-bed ap­pro­pri­ate safe man­age­ment mea­sures in this im­por­tant pro­duc­tion pi­lot that could pave the way for sports events to take place in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>One is in dis­cus­sions with other coun­tries’ gov­ern­ments to stage more in­ter­na­tional events.</p>
    <p>Its next event is on Oct 30, al­though de­tails will only be re­leased next week.</p>
    <p>The Oct 30 event will see Sin­ga­pore’s Chris­tian Lee de­fend his light­weight world ti­tle against un­de­feated Luri Lapi­cus of Moldova, while the Re­pub­lic’s Tiffany Teo will get an­other shot at the strawweigh­t world ti­tle against China’s Xiong Jing Nan, who de­feated her the pre­vi­ous time they fought.</p>
